plete occupation of Maurepas brings
the French and English advanced lines

CONGRESS PLANS
ADJOJNMENT
Remaining Business to Be

Washington, Aug. 25. Administra
tion leaders in congress were today

said he believed it could be done un
less unforeseen developments arise.

th3 house next Tuseday, then pass
the revenue bill and adjourn.
"I believe efforts will be made to
bring up the immigration bill and the
corrupt practices bill," said Senator
Simmons, "but I think congress will
adjourn nevertheless as soon as it Is
discovered that both those measures
vIll provoke prolonged debate."
Republicans and Democratic lead

HOPES TO CHECK
SOARilWES
Senator Hitchcock Proposes
Amendment to Revenue
Bill Dealing With
Print Paper.
Washington, - Aug. 25. Senator
Hitchcock, Democrat, has prepared an
amendment to the revenue bill Intend
ed to check the soaring prices of news
print paper. He said today he would
bring it up in the senate when certain
sections of the bill were reached for
debate. Mr. Hitchcock is himself a
newspaper publisher.
Paper selling at $40 a ton and un
der would- not be taxed. When the
price passes $40 a ton a tax of $1 a
ton would prevail until $45 a ton is
reached, when the tax would increase
to $3 and mount up gradually until a
tax of ?40 a ton would prevail on
paper.
To Foil Manufacturers.
"My proposed amendment is design
ed not so much to raise revenue," said
Mr. Hitchcock, "as it is to make it
unprofitable for paper manufacturers
to charge exorbitant prices for news
print paper.
"The price of news print paper has
been very stable for several years un
til recently, selling around 2 cents a
pound at the mills. There has been
an increase in the consumption of pa
per in the last two years for two rea
sons. First, the great increase in cir
culation arising from the war, and
recently the greater volume of adver
tising, due to prosperity. The result Is
that all surplus stock of paper has
practically disappeared.
Mills Taking Advantage.
"Tho mills are making about 6,500
tons a day and we are importing about
1,200 tons a day from Canada, but this
does not meet the demand. The re
sult Is that manufacturers whose prod
uct Is not fully contracted for are tak
ing advantage of the situation to sell
paper at exorbitant figures."
While the great bulk of news print
paper selling at 2 cents a pound un
der existing contracts, all new sales
are bringing from 4 to 5 cents a
pound.
CALL FOR PEACE
BY THE SWORD
Consider England Most Dan
gerous Enemy Germany
Must Win at Any Cost.
Berlin, Aug. 25, 5 p. ra., via London,
2:35 a. m. A proclamation contain
ing views on the peace conditions
which might be imposed by Germany
is published today by "The Indepen
dents for a Gorman Peace," an or
ganization formed some time ago by
those considered to be the extreme
war advocates in Germany.
The proclamation asserts that, des
pite the fact that the Germans and
their allies are holding three king
doms in their hands, the entente
statesmen contlnuo to Indulge in a
flood of abjtse and lies about Ger
many, while themselves violating
every principle of international law
I forcing neutrals to enter the war
against their better judgment and at
tempting to force into submission
through hunger millions whom their
swords could not vanquish.
Allies Will Not Succeed.
. "Our enomies will not succeed,"
continues tho proclamation. "One
1 thing they have accepted is to forco
upon us the realization that England
is our special and most dangerous
enemy. England causes our enemies
to stick together. England leads
them. Upon England they depend
and will depend moro after the war.
On the wreckage of our empire Eng
land hopes to unfurl the banner of
Anglo-Saxon world dominion."
The document asserts that Russian
territory t from the Baltic to the Vol
hynia must be Included in the German
sphere to serve as a bulwark against
the Russian tendency to annihilate
Germany. French revenge ideas must
constantly be kept In mind s&Mhat In
the west also changes would be ne
cessary. ,
Belgium in the future, adds the
proclamation, either will be a Ger
man or an English bulwark so "real
guarantees" here also aro needed.
The document then cites the expres
sion of Dr. Peter Spahn, leader of
the Catholic Center party in the relch
stag, that "Belgium must lie in Ger
man hands militarily, economically
and politically."
England Alms at German Ruin.
The proclamation concludes with
the assertion:
"England's plan threatens us with
political and economical helotrj'. It
aims at our life as a people and as a
state. It aims at our culture and
institutions. Energy must bo applied,
regardless of consequences, to force
peace upon this enemy. Let it not
come through that, as England says
we will win all the battles, but Eng
land will win the war. With von
Hindenburg, let us say it is not only
a question of sticking it out, but of
winning."

day that In his opinion tho safe re
turn of the Deutschland to Germany
will convince mariy citizens of Teu
tonic descent who have been disposed
to criticise President Wilson that his
official attitude in connection with

trality. "I think that the feeling among
many of our patriotic citizens of Ger

SALE IS URGED
BY THFJEOPLE
Local St. Thomas Legislators
Urge Transfer of Islands to
United States.
St. Thomas, D. W. I., Aug. 24.
(Delayed). In resolutions' adopted to
day the local legislature urged upon
the Danish government tho expedit
ing of the negotiations for the sale
of the Danish West Indies to the Unit
ed States. The transfer of the slands
to tho United States as speedily as
possible to end the uncertainty of the
present situation Is "earnestly re
quested" of the mother country.
The resolutions follow:
"As constantly recurring sale ne
gotiations paralyze all enterprises in
St. Thomas and great depression with
a public deficit and private misery
has already been caused by the war
and by disappointment from the Pan
ama canal the mother country is ear
nestly requested to hasten the pres
ent negotiations and Implored not to
reject the sale unless the entire na
tion demands it and be willing to take
the consequences afterward."
The resolutions which were adopt
ed unanimously were cabled to the fl
nanco minister at Copenhagen, Den
mark. Efforts to Close Sale Continue.
Washington, Aug, 25. Rejection by
tho Danish upper house of parliament
of the proposal to sell the Danish
West Indies to the United States will

STRIKE SETTLEMENT IN A MAZE
AND SITUATION IS UNCHANGED
Presidents, Who Were Willing Yesterday to Accept the Eight
Hour Day, Go Back to Majority and All Are "Standing
With Backs Against the Wall" Brotherhoods
Stand for Wilson Basis of Settlement and Dead
lock Remains Unbroken.
Washington, Aug. 25. The railway
strike negotiations resolved them
selves today, outwardly at least, into
a more or less confused state.
Expressions of optimism from both
sides were not so free as they were
yesterday and feeling, heretofore gen
eral among the managers that a plan
to include the eight-hour day would
be found, was not so evident. Some
of the. railway executives reverted to
their prediction that it never would
be conceded.
President Wilson kept his cabinet
waiting an hour while he conferred
with the four brotherhood heads.
All parties to the conference stead
fastly refused to say what was talked
about.
Railroad Executives Studying.
The railroad executives conferred
among themselves during the day and
it was thought possible they might
later go to the White House. For
the executives, this statement was is
sued: "The executives are understood to
be studying the form of a communi
cation to the president."
Some of the more optimistic still
had hopes of a final decision being
reached before tomorrow night. The
opinion that the eight-hour basic day
will not be conceded apparently was
growing as the conferences proceeded.
Employes ana managers uevuiau
practically no time today to con-
sideration of freight rate increases or
settlement of -future, strikes,-but cen
tered on the length of the working
day and pay.
The brotherhood leaders declared
they were standing on President Wil
son's plan and had not changed their
attitude a particle.
Washington, Aug. 25. Late this
afternoon Presidents Lovett, Holden,
of the Union Pacific and Burlington
respectively went to the Whlto House.
It was understood they would out-,
line to President Wilson the conclu
sions of the executives so far.
It was said the presidents were
standing more closely together for
arbitration than at any time since
they had assembled here and that
some of those who at first were for
acepting President Wilson's plan, had
been brought over to a majority which
was described as "standing backs to
the wall."
It was Indicated that the communi
cation being prepared for President
Wilson would contain a further Insis
tence on arbitration.
President Summons Men.
Washington, Aug. 25. President
Wilson summoned representatives of
the employers and employes involved j
in tne mreaianuu iuwwuj amn.c, .u
the White House today for confer
ences to discuss proposals which have
developed out of his original plan of
settlement.
Arrangements were made Tor the
representatives of the employes to see
the president at 10:30 o'clock and for
Ike representatives of the employers
later.
Cabinet Kept Waiting.
The four brotherhood heads re
mained with the president an hour
and a half but would make no state
ment on leaving. The president kept
the cabinet waiting for an hour to
continue his conference with the rail
road men.
"The situation, Insofar as we are
concerned," A. B. Gerretson, spokes
man for tho employes, later said,
"Is absolutely unchanged. No con
crete proposition to which tho rail
roads will agreo has been tendered
us. Our position is exactly tho same
as it was when wo accepted the presi
dent's plans. We have deviated from
It In no way ttwhat ever."
The brotherhood leaders went "from
the White House to report to a meet
ing of the employers' representative?,
but insisted they had nothing new
to report.
Order Messages Sent Wilson.
W. G. Lee, of the trainmen, gave
out copies of an order which he said
had been sent by the Northern Pacific
to station agents directing them to
get local Interests to send telegraphic
protests to President Wilson against
settling tho controversy by other
means than arbitration. Tho other
telegrams, Mr. Lee declared, were to
bo paid for by tho railroad, and were
evidence of what the men charac
terize ns a propaganda against tho
president's plan.
Presidents Facing Objections.
Washington, Aug. 25. Railroad
presidents were confronted today with
a number of objections to their tenta
tive plan for meeting the union broth
erhoods' demands by granting the
eight-hour day on condition that
frefght rate increases and public in
vestigation of future wage disputes bo
assured. They arranged another
meeting shortly before noon to con
sider their special committee's pro- iH
posal and It appeared possible that a ' H
final conclusion would be postponed il
until next week, B
These conditions weighed against ll
the chances of a rate increase: . H
There is no means of assuring what 1
action the interstate commerce com- B
mission might take, particularly inas- H
much as previously it has indicated H
unwillingness to consider wage stand-
ards in dealing with proposed rate in-
creases; strong influence of big ship- H
pors probably would be thrown against IH
higher rates; President Wilson's stand IH
for an increase would amount to lit- IH
tie if he should fail of re-election; re- IH
gardlcss of other hazards, new rates
could not be put into effect before ll
next March., iH
The greatest element of uncertain- 1
ty regarding the proposed legislation B
for creating a federal body to Invest!- jH
gate labor demands before a strike JB
might be followed was the probable
hostility of labor leaders to the plan.
Continued hostility of many presi- I
dents to the eight-hour day under any , B
circumstances complicated the situa- B
tion further. B
