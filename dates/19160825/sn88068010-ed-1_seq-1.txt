Number 30
Leading Physician and Surgeon
1 Stricken making Call
Brunswick Moorns
Thursday evening as John S.
Wallace was making a profes
sional call a short distance from
his hotel, he became sick and
reaching the house, took a seat
and remarked about the steep
ness of the steps and said that
he had eaten too heartily at sup
per. He began to feel worse
immediately and asked Joe Tur
ner at whose house he had call
ed, to make . him a toddy.
Turner hastened to comply but
in a few moments Dr. Wallace
"told bira it was too late, that it
was all over. Physicians
were called immediately, but
when the first one arrived he
saw at a glance that nothing
could be done to relieve the
stricken man and in about fifteen
minutes from the time of the at
tack on his heart, Dr. John S.
Wallace had passed into the il
limitable beyond.
John Snoddy Wallace was born
April 25 1849 near Glasgow. His
father, John S. Wallace was born
in Kentucky in 1801, having set
tied near Glasgow at an early
date", and except for a trip with
the 49rs on which he started a
few hours after the birth of the
subject of this sketch, lived for
years on the old homestead. His
father died in 1851, leaving his
widow, and children, Mrs. Maria
Davis who died July 1 1912, Mrs,
Margaret Fristoe of Cape Girar
deau, Mo., Mrs. Susan A. Head
of Palmyra, Mo., Capt J as. C,
Wallace who died June 30 at this
city, Dr. Robert Bruce Wallace
who died in Union Neb. Sept 11
- 1901. Idresa , E." Wallace, , who
died in 1870; A half sister, of
John S. Wallace. Mrs. Perry S.
Rader of Jefferson City (Miss
Bennie Younger) and sisters
mentioned, are the only immedi
ate surviving relatives.
Dr. Wallace spent the early
part of his life on the old home
stead, going to school at Pritch
ett College where he completed
his education then taking up the
studay of medicine in the office
of Dr. I. P. Vaughn at Glasgow.
After about two years with Dr.
Vaughn, Dr. Wallace went to
Ann Arbor Medical College,
took the course there and then
to Bellevue in New York where
he completed his medical and
surgical studies. In 1873 Dr.
Wallace began the ' practice of
medicine at Brunswick and with
the exception of a time in Den
ver and later in St Louis amoun
ting to about six years, his en
tire professional life was spent
in this community and in the elec
tion in 1914 was overwhelmingly
elected state senator. Dr. Wal
lace was a Shriner, Knight Tem
plar and one of the most prom
inent members of the Masonic
fraternity at Brunswick. He
was a past president of the med
ical society and had the reputa
tion of being one of the best
diagnosticians in the state. Dr.
Wallace never married, the rea
son for which if any, no one ever
; knew, but a more popular, gal
lant and woman-respecting: man
it would be hard to name. Among
young people, especially children
Dr. Wallace was always a favor
ite. Jovial, ' interested in their
joys and troubles when he knew
of them, he was loved by them
all and many the juvenile heart
which palpitated with deep sor
row when his death wasannoun-
. ced. '
Dr. Wallace Was pronounced'
in his views and never uncertain
in his friendships or dislikes.
Intrepid, a despiser of ' shams
and an implacable enemy of
hyyrocruy; honest and open in
his dealings with man kind;
symphetic and strenenous in his
efforts to relieve suffering; pos
sessing the confidence of all who
knew him and worthy the crown
of glory as a reward of well spent
life, it is no' wonder that his po
sition in the community where
he had spent the greater part of
his life was among its chief
leaders.
Dr. Wallace was a literary
character of note, and a good
speaker and better writer. His
coleagues in the senate not only
highly respected him for his
clear views, but relied on
his judgement concerning mat
ters of moment, and those pres
ent during obsequies expressed
the feeling of their great loss.
Saturday afternoon Rev. Bowl
es conducted funeral services at
the residence of Mr. and
Mrs. J. M. Barker in Brunswick
at which Governor Painter, Sen
ators Morton of Ray, McClintick
of Monroe and Goodson of Macon
members of the Masonic frater
nity from all parts of the coun
ty, M. Ds from every section
tion and friends had assembled
in great numbers to pay their
last respects to the deceased.
The floral tributes were unusual
ly profuse and splendid.
The services of the Methodist
church of which Dr. Wallace
was a member being over, Eure
ka Lodge A. F. &A. M. took
charge of further funeral cere
monies and the earthly remains
of the cherished brother were de
posited in Elliott Grove Cemetery.

Mr. 0. D. Myers of Turney
Mo. a brother to Rev. W. L
Meyers and Miss Elizabeth Heinz
of Turney were united in mar-
lage at the Methodist parsonage
Wednesday evening Rev. Meyers
sealing the vows of the happy
couple. Mr. Meyers is engaged
in farming near Turney and aft
er a short time here and Kansas
City, the newlyweds will take
up their residence on their farm.
Congratulatory Letter
Acknowledged.
Congressman Rucker answers
the letter he received from Hon.
Ralph Lozier as follows:
August 17, 1916.
Hon. R. F. Lozier,
Carrollton, Missouri.
Dear Mr. Lozier:
Your letter of August 7th.
congratulating me upon my nom
ination at the recent primary,
was forwarded from Keytes
ville and reached me here in
due time.
Conscious of the fact that
neither myself nor any friend
who gave me support uttered
one word or did a. single act dur
ing the campaign which would
justly cause any fair-minded
man to feel the least resent
ment or harbor a suspicion that
unfair methods , were employed
to secure my nomination, I was
not surprised at the receipt of
your cordial letter of congratula
tions and assurance of support
I assure you I appreciate the
tone of the letter you wrote me.
'.My. pleasure-. over being the
nominee of the splendid Demo
craryof the second district of
Missouri, to which I am proud
to confess most profound obliga
tions, is diminished only by the
knowledge that my success at
the primary necessarily means
the disappointment of another
who entertained laudable ' ambi
tions. . '-' ' '
Thanking you for your letter
and with kind regards, I beg to
remain'
. Very respectfully,
W. W. Rucker.
Gilbert Lamb's law office 2s be

tasteful manner. ' r
The Blue Mark
calling attention to arrearage on sub
scription, is omitted this week, so
many having taken notice and paid.
Look at the label on your paper,
whether it is blue marked or not; it
will tell you how you stand.
Free Text Book
The school board met the latter
part of last week and purchased
books for all the pupils of the
school to and including the
eighth grade.
The board took this plan and
will pay for the books, one third
of the amount each year for
three years, paying 6 per cent on
deferred payments, rather than
buying what it could pay for and
leaving so many of the pupils
to wait one and two years for
their books. ,
There was a large number of
book-house representatives here,
among whom our old friend John
P. Coleman appeared to no dis
advantage in no particular and
the board gave him a fair share
of the business.
James T. Rucker Dead
James T. Rucker of Lewisburg
W. Va., died Sunday evening
after an illness of several years,
During the eighties he was
well and favorably known in
this county having taught school
at several points and our school
as well as high schools in Linn
and Audrian counties.
For years he was the head of
a West Virginia State institution
but his health became such as
to force him to resign the
tion.
He was the father of Hon. R.
W. Rucker and Miss Anna Parks
Rucker and a brother of con
gressman Rucker and a man of
great literary attainments.
Republican Convention
Split more than half in two is
the way prominent Republicans
regard their party since the row
at Jefferson City Convention

Republican State Committee.

tention of T. W. Huckriede who

Peary Discredited
Lieut. Peary who told the
world that Dr. Cook was hand
ing it a gold brick, has himself
been again discredited. Ensign
Fitzhugh Green a 28 year old
Mo. attache of the U. S. Army,
was sent out 3 years ago to sur
vey "Crocker Land," which
Peary claimed to have discover
ed. Ensign Green could find no
such land in 8 years search in
the neighborhood where Peary
said he found it Rausmit Cook

Who Started It?
There was a rumor that Judge
Rucker had intimated that he
Would not be a candidate to suc
ceed himself two years hence
which get in the air tho evident
ly not in a current moving in
any particular direction.
Any suggestion that Judge
Rucker would not again be in
the race must have sprung from
some interested source, other
than himself, for he has said
nor intimated nothing warran
ting such a conclusion.
' We are safe in saying that
when Judge Rucker determines
to retire from politics he will
take the public into his confi
dence and render it unnecessary
for those who desire that he get
out to speculate on his intentions
and future action.
Houchin's Manifesto
Hon. Jas. A. Houchin is out
in a handsomely lithographed
letter to his supporters in which
he states that conditions obtain
ing during the campaign left
him without the slightest hope
of becoming the nominee of the
Democratic party for Governor,
and he expresses the belief that
he was traded in every part of
the state. Mr. Houchin further
posi-iUtates that he is of the same
opinion now as then, whatever
the opinion referred to.

verdict of the people and his

CHAUTAUQUA CLOSED
No Contract Made For Next
Season, Receipts Less than
Expenses. Fairly Good
Program
With the University Girls
stunts Saturday night the Jones
Chautauqua Company closed its
weeks engagement here. With
a few exceptions the numbers
were fairly good all thru and
some were unusually good, but
the main drawing features lack
ed pulling qualities and the
Conmercial Club got stuck a3
usual and should for taking such
ventures.
We reviewed in last weeks
issue the program as rendered
until Thursday. Thursday after
noon the audience was disap
pointed by the appearance of
Baer or some such name who
came to fill the place of C. C.
Jesse. Baer and his travelinc
companion, Clayton H. Staples.
arrived Wednesday afternoon
and gave the passengers in the
street car a sample of their wit
and humor. It was a fair samDle
and their performances on the
stage were of the same variety
of high class Smart Aleck tom
foolery of the disgusting kind.
Staples ha9 learned how to crayon
three or four tolerable pictures
but spoils his work by what he
evidently believes to be bright
remarks but which all his audi
ences must know to be vaporings
from a feeble mind. Baer has
nothing whatever to his credit
and the pair completely disgusted
several young women passen
gers on the car whose attention
the bums appeared to be most
desirous of attracting.
Dr. T. Alex Cairns was well
received and his lecture highly
appreciated with the exception
of that part he devoted to wo
men suffrage. Dr. Cairns is of
a pattern with apostles of Dr.
Anna Howard Shaw and Carolina
Cecelia Catt but outmeasurps
the average lecturer when he
sticks to his proper mission.
The Quivira Quintette was
pretty punk, butpunkest when
trying to sing. On their punkin
stalk instruments they perform
ed fairly well for amateurs, but
the plaintive wailings which they
produced under the title of songs
was little less than excrutiating
at times.
What the Commercial Club ex
pected to pull out of the hole on
was Dr. Frederick Cook's story
of how he attained the pole, to
gether with the University Girls
Saturday afternoon and evening,
but their hopes were sadly dis
appointed. Dr. Cooks fake
claims about having climbed Mt
McKinley and later discovering
the North Pole were too well
known to the general public to
draw fifty cents from many
pockets to hear him repeat them.
Dr. Cook's book on the sub
ject of the north pole excursion
which now sells for 50 cents in
stead of its first price of $3.00 is
much more interesting than his
lecture and the fact that the
price of the book dropped so far
may be explained when the rea
son for his being on one of the
smallest chautauqua circuits in
stead of getting $15000 for a
single lecture is understood.
The University Girls were not
the same as those at our neigh
boring city last year in feature,
form or flubdubbery except three
or four of them whose presence
was necessary to make the squad
presentable at all. The clarinet
ist and trap drummer were the
only musicians in the bunch and
the 200 pound diva might have
sung a little if she had not tried
so hard, but her herculean effort
