If the people of Graham county
will give me their support and
elect me their County Attorney
I will exert mv best ability and
use every effort in my power to
renaer to tne people nonest ser
vices and secure as far as pos
sible a full enforcement of the
laws If I am your County At
torney l will prosecute every
violator of the law regardless of
who he is without fear or favor
I will be on the job at all times
and will carry my part of the re
sponsibility
Safford and Graham county be
ing my home T am naturally in
terested in the iuture welfare of
the county and shall not at any
time tau to lend my assistance
in doing what is possible for the
betterment ot the county and its
citizens While it has been re
ported that- ifv J aravilected
would favor certain -violations of
the law my past record will
prove theKUseness of this state
ment The statement was made
because of my defending a num
ber of nersons charced with a
violation of the prohibition law
It is erroneous and unwarranted
and will not be believed by any
fair minded person If a lawyer
defends a man for the larceny of
a cow does that mean that he is
in favor of theft If a lawyer
defends a man for murder
dtfes that say that he believes
in or favors murder The
report is without foundation and
certainly does not come from a
clear thinking mind
The person making this state
ment certainly cannot be sincere
in same because everybody Knows
that the traffic in intoxicating
liquors in braham county is as
rank as rag weeds in a lawyers
garden There is all kinds of it
being sold openly and every
other way It is a violation of
the law to do so and the violator
should be prosecuted and he will
be if I am selected to represent
the people as their County At
torney There is something
wrong the records of the
Kerior Courtwill show that there
as not been one single convic
tion for the sale of intoxicating
liquors in Graham county for the
last twelve months
I have been prosecuting and
defending men charged with
violating the prohibition laws
since 1907 as well as various
other crimes I believe I know
both sides I know the pro
cedure resorted to by the de
fense and I know how to get the
evidence for a conviction If I
am elected your County Attorney
I will render you honest service
and will never shirk a duty un
der any circumstances
Respectfully yours

HUNTS STATEMENT
ABSOLUTELY
FALSE
Obey Never Supported or
Lobbied for the Mine -
Tax BUI
AfTlDAVITS P80VE tHSFACt
While Hunt Did Advocate Fir
Special Mine Tax Bill
in Meuage
George A Olney candidate for
the democratic nomination as
governor on having his attention
called to aparagraph in a letter
written by Gov Hunt and pub-
nshed in the Chandler Ariwwin
of July 21st advertisinghis can
didacy as follows
I wonder if you Jcnow that
my opponent in the present cam
paign was a supporter and lob
byist of the mine tax bill which
would have transferred approxi
mately 73000000 of the as
sessed valuation of the State
from the big mining companies
to the farmers stockmen and
homebwners said
Utterly Fake
Governor Hunt must be hard
driven to adopt methods such as
this I brand
the statement as a
direct and malicious falsehood -and
deny the allegation in toto
Fortunately I anticiDated -some
such move as this and am able to
refute the slander by absolute
andiinconvertible testimony
I defy anyone to produce a
man or woman who would truth
fully say that I had supported
lobbied for a special mine tax
bill Everyone with whom t
talked concerning this bill knows
that I took the opposite position
Hon D H Clandflre who led
- U a Le it
c r
Vn
yptaijldand overilhtr4atiJPMh3i11nteWith
me concernimnthe same on sev
eral different occasions -and I ad
vised hfm against it
Gov Hunt and Claridge are
personal friends All my friends
in the hou3e and senate and all
with whom I was acquainted in
the house and senate knew that
I opposed the speciaL mine tax
bill Had I been in Position tn
do so I should have opposed the
special mine tax Dili passed by
the first legislature the one
whose passage Gov Hunt earn
estly advocated in a special mes
sage to the senate as follows
What Huat Said
I believe that Senate Bill
No 3 offers in all its more promi
nent features as good and rea
sonable solution of the mine tax
question as can be secured in the
time allowed and with ihe in
formation available This meas
ure in the form in which it now
awaits approval by the senate
provides for the assessment and
taxing of mines on a basis of
four times the net and twelve
and one half per cent of the gross
earnings I therefore MOST
EARNESTLY RECOMMEND
THE PASSAGE OF SENATE
BILL NO 3 in its present form
Hk Only Word
This is the only official word
on record that Gov Hunt has
ever uttered There is not a
word recorded where the gov
ernor opposed the mine tax till
which he accused me of having
lobbied for
If it is true that the passage of
the mine tax bill would have
transferred approximately
000000 of the assessed valuation
in the State from the big mine
owners to the farmers the stock
men and the home owners he is
personally responsible for this
class of tax payers having paid on
3000000 more than theyshould
have done during the two years
that tho special mine tax law was
in force that he so earnestly
advocated
He may urge that time was
pressing and something had to
be done This however can be
no excuse The law directs the
assessment of property where
over found If the tax commis
sion had sufficient authority to
properly assess the mines this
year they certainly had the
authority to perform the same
act during the two years that the
special mine tax law wa3 in force
Here is an affidavit from Sen
ator Claridge and another from
W W Pace that will showr how
I stood on the question and which
I think being Bworn documents
