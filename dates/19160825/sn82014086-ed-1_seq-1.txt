FIGHT I NSENATE OVERT
CORRUPT PRACTICE ACT.
Republican Opposition May Prevent
Early Adjournment.
Washington. Aug. 24. Republican
senators were accused today by Sen
ator Owenn, democrat, of a deliberate
effort to prevent action before the No
vember election on his corrupt prac
tices bill, which would put strict lim
itations on campaign contributions.
Then the Oklahoma senator announc
ed that he would make an insistent
fight to bring up the measure at this
session of congress regardless of con
sequences to early adjournment plans.
He declared that the existing cam
paign contributions law was a fraud
upon the American people, charged
that the so-called lumber trust had
sent $40,000 into Oklahoma to defeat
his renomination because he voted to
deny William Lorimer aseat in the
senate and precipitated a lively de
bate in which republican and demo
cratic senators bitteily accused each
other of planning to buy the ap
proaching election.
All the carefully laid plans of sen
ate leaders to make possible an ad
journment of congress late next week
were threatened when Senator Owen
announced that he was ready to stay
here until winter to pass the bill if
tepublicans attempted a filibuster. He
said, he would make a motion to take
it up as soon as the revenue bill was
passed. Last week democratic lead
ers thought they had enough votes to
defeat such a motion pledged from
senators who desire an adjournment.
Whether Senntod Owen's sensational
presentation of his plea for action has
cbrnged that situation is problema
tical. Should his motion prevail re
publican leaders say a prolonged fight
will be made on the measure, which
ihey insist is impracticable and im
irssibie of enforcement in its pres
ent foi in.
Senator Owen made his announce
ment after his request for unanimous
consent to take up the bill immedi
r.". ly after pa.-saee of the revenue lull
had been objected to by Senator
Smoot.
TAKING BLOOD FROM FORMER
INFANTILE PARALYSIS PATIENTS
To Ee Used as a Serum for Those Nov.
Suffering from the Disease.
Xew York, Aug. 24. A systematic
campaign to o'btain blood from persons
who have had infantile paralysis in
former years, to be used as serum for
those now suffering from the disease
will be started here tomorrow by the
citizens' committee which is co-operating
with the city health department.
This iitep has been made necessary, it
was said, by the scarcity of the serum
which the .health . authorities have j
found to bo beneficial in the present
epidemic. i
To allay the fears of those who an i
supply the serum but who may be
timid about undergoing the operation,
ireulars will bo distributed widely in
the city explaining how the blood is
obtained.
"The serum is made from the blood
of those who have had the diseas","
the circulars state, "and it is hoped
that as many as possible of the boys,
giris, men and women who have them
selves suffered from the disease, and
who do not weigh less than 70 pounds,
will give their blood to prevent the
lifelong- sorrow that comes with in
fantile paralysis.
"The blood is collected by means of
a line hollow needle thrust into a vein
at the end of the elbow. The collec
tion of the blood is very painless and
cattses no inconvenience. It will be
done by the doctors of the department
of health."
Health Commissioner Emerson stated
today that in 10- cases in city hospi
tals, adrenalin treatment had been used
with encouraging results. The depart
ment bulletin today warned that it is
not unlikely infantile norniy.sir. is
spread by flies, rea- h' -. e dbugs and

Said "It May Be Settled in Twenty Minutes or It May
Go Over Until Next Week" The Special Committee

to Handle Labor Troubles in the Future.
Washington, Aug. 24. Objections, -which
developed tonight at a meet
ing of railroad presidents and man
agers, t opoints in the tentative plan
evolved by the committee of eight
presidents considering ways to avoid
the threatened general strike, result
ed in a further postponement of final
action. The conference adjourned to
meet again tomorrow and, as one
president phrased it, the situation is
such that "it may be settled in twen
ty minutes or the matter may go over
until next week."
Statement by Railroad Heads.
A statement issued by the railroad
executives tonight summed it up
thus:
"At the invitation of President
Wilson. Messrs. Hale Holden, Judge
R. S. Lovett and Daniel Wiilard went
to the White House at noon and held
a short conference with the president.
"A conference of railroad executives
was held at 3 o'clock and a new
phase of the situation of some im
portance was laid before the confer
ence by the special committee.
"After considerable discussion with
out definite action an adjournment
was taken until 11 o'clock tomorrow
morning. In the meantime the special
committee of the presidents will con
tinue its labors."
The special committees plan, draft
ed after a week's consideration, would
provide for granting an eight hour
"basis" day to the trainmen, but with
assurance that the administration
would make every effort to secure a
freight rate increase to recompense
the roads and fm-ther assurance that
congress would be asked to enact leg
islation to insure settlement of fu
ture labor disputes through an inves
tigating commission.
The entire plan has not been laid
before all the executives and mana
gers, but its points have been dis
cussed at the various conferences. It
developed after tonight's meeting that
objection had been raised to the
freight rate increase feature on at
least two grounds. Some argued that
there can be no assurance of a rate
increase because no one could say
what the interstate commerce com
mission might do; and that some of
the most important shippers of the
country' already hat'e made it plain
that they are not in sympathy with
any move which may mean a rate in
crease. It was pointed out also that
although President Wilson has ex
pressed his belief that such a rate
increase should be granted if the eight
hour day is given the employes, no
one can tell how the next election is
coming out and that there can by no
possibility be an increase before next
March or probably later.
Attention was called, too, to the
fact that the commission hitherto has
held that it cannot consider wage
standards in dealing with proposed
rate increases, although legislation by
congress might remove that difficulty.

BERLIN CELEBRATES RETURN

Captain Koenin and His Crew Were
Feted as Heroes.
Berlin, Aug. 24, via London, 10.15
p. m. Most of the buildings here are
decked with flags in celebration of the
return of the submarine merchant
man Deutschland. The newspapers
gave the exploit of Captain Koenig
the prominent place in their editorial
comments and discuss the .possibility
of the empire getting certain much
needed materials through merchant
man submarines. Captain Koenig and
his crew have been feted as heroes
and the press gives liberal praise to
the fair and neutral conduct of the
United States government. The Co
logne Gazette says: "The American
government was thoroughly and cor
rectly neutral. The American fleet
saw strictly that the American boun
daries were duly respected by the En
glish as well as the French, "increased
precautions were taken after an Eng
lish cruiser had surreptitiously entered
Chesapeake Bay at night."
Tho semi-official Norddeutsche All
gemeine Zeitung points out that ships
of the Deutschland and Bremen type
will render valuable services during
the war but their value will be slight
on the return of peace.
' Captain Koenig personally express
ed great satisfaction at the treatment
accorded him by the American gov

ITUATION
RAILROAD EXECUTIVES
The principal arguments aglanst tbe;
idea of a permanent commission fori
the prevention or settlement of strikes
were that it would almost certainly I
be fought by labor in congress, and I
that while President Wilson might be'
entirely willing now to back such
legislation he might not be in a po-'
sition to do so when it was proposed.)
Representatives of the brotherhoods
who heard of this phase of the plan;
today were plainly against It. Aj
counter suggestion was heard among;
the presidents that strike question!
should be left to the Interstate Com-!
merce Commission, with power to in-1
vostigate and make a public report Of!
their findings with a strike held in
abeyance pending the investigation.
The special committee's plan has
been tentatively accepted by the com
mittee of eight and it was the sub
ject of today's conference at the
White House. Its substance was com
municated to the labor representatives
through Judge William L. Chambers
of the Board of Mediation and Concil
iation. The railroad presidents are under
stood not to be Insistent on the com
mittee idea for the settlement of fu
ture disputes an dthe main difficulty
has been the working out of operating
plans under an eight hour day and of
giving assurances to the presidents
and managers that they can count up
on a freight rate increase. Presidents
and managers agree that the operate
ing problem presented is one of the
most complicated they have under
taken.
Greneral Opinion is for Eight Hours.
There seems to ' be general opiniod
that the eight hour day must be
granted, but roads which now are
operating on only a narrow margin of
profit or on which the physical diffi
culties are unusual present serious
problems to be overcome. The ef
fort has been to include in the eight
hour days concession a solution of
some of the other questions such as
overtime pay, etc. which might make
it less expensive to the railroads.
There were reports tonight that soma
of the executives still are unalterably
opposed to granting the eight hour
day under any circumstances and
might attempt tomorrow to enforce a
decision which would bring the nego
tiations to an end, one way or an
other. It has become known that in their
conferences with President Wilson
the executives pointed out that since
it was his view that the eight, hour
day is approved by society, apparently
it eventually must be extended to oth
er railroad employes and to those in
other lines of endeavor. An estimate
of the ultimate cost was given the
president.
President Wilson is said to have
taken the position that the freight
rate increase will be forthcoming be
cause of the weight of public opinion
will back the eight hour day and will
also back any plan to give the rail
roads the revenue to provide for the
added expense.
RED AND BLUE FLEETS
HAVE COME IN CONTACT.
Strict Censorship on All Reports
Reaching the Navy Department.
r.' -'
Washington, Aug. 24. Navy officials
believed it possible tonight that the
Red and Blue fleets bad come into
contact somewhere off the Atlantic
coast and were enacting the closing
scenes of the great war game which
began two days ago. A strict censor
ship was imposed, however, by Rear
Admiral Benson, acting secretary and
chief of operations, on all reports
reaching the navy department.
A message early today from Rear
Admiral Helm, commanding the Blue
defending fleet, indicated that his
scouts might have located either the
Red fleet of its phantom train of
transports hypothetical!?' loaded with
the men and supplies of an invading
army Admiral Mayo is seeking to land
on 'the Atlantic coast. There were in
dications also that further reports had
come showing. that the Blue "fleet was
hurrying toward its enemy and .that
the scouts at least were in touch. Ad
miral Benson would not discuss the
progress of the game further than to
say that it was possible a theoretical
battle was taking place tonight.
The outcome will be determined by
Rear Admiral Knight, head of the navy
war college, who, as umpire, is -on the
scene of action aboard the superdread
nought Pennsylvania.
