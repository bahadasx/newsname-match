GIANTS' OUTFieiD IS
MANAGER M'GRAW'S WRECKING CREW.
With Speulter shifted to Cleveland and with Sam Crawford slowing up a
bit, there is no longer any question as to the game's greatest outfield. It con
sists of Burns, Kauff and Roberston of the New York Giants. Taking in the
essential factors of speed, fielding, throwing and batting, this trio is weU be
yond all other competition.
All three are .300 hitters ; all three can field and peg and all three can
cover a world of outfield soil. And they are all young enough to face a
long future together. Burns is twenty-seven, Kauff and Robertson are but
twenty-four. They have more combined power than the old Speaker-Lewis-Hooper
array and greater speed than the Cobb-Crawford-Veach combination
at its best.
VETERAN SHORTSTOP IS FAST
George McBrlde of Washington, Like
Wagner and Lajoie, Covers Vast
Amount of Territory.
George McBrlde, Washington's short
stop and captain of the team, is al-
tiost the age of Wagner and Lajoie,
nd has been with the Senators eight
years. He is thirty-four years old,
pnd yet Is as fast and nimble as when
he first broke Into fast company.
Meiiride's speed afield has always
ibeen great, as It alone has kept him
In the majors. He has never shown
any talent at all with the bat and his
fattest year ir. this respect was 1011,
George McBrlde.
When he batted .285. Last season he
batted .204 and he has very seldom
done much better. That he continued
jo fast company and excellent repute
the greater tribute to his brilliance
on the field.
But perhaps the most Interesting
feature of McBrlde's career Is the
ttuull number of games he has ever
missed. During five seasons in the
fght years be has been with Wash
ington he has played in every game on
the schedule. In only one season has
oe failed to take part In at least 150
tames, and that was last season,
hen he had part In 146. For a veteran-he's,
been in baseball IB years
now that's a record to talk about

The Germans and Austrlans have
not decided Just what they will do
with Serbia should they be able to re
tain their Balkan conquests. Two
things are certain. First, Austria will
keep a large section of the country
and Bulgaria another large slice. Sec
ond, no member of the Karageorgevltch
family will be allowed to reign, unless
the entente allies win. Probably one
of the host of prolific German prince

In Montenegro the situation Is clear.

In Greece, too, King Constantine's
tenure depends plainly on the great
battles now being fought In the East
and Wes.
Constantine has a German wife; in
deed, the queen is the kaiser's own sis

otic motives, the king's course of con
duct has. all along been marked by
hostility to the kaiser's enemies.
First he refused to come to the as
sistance of Serbia, as he was bound to
do by treaty. He allowed German
agitators full sway In his country.
Next, he mobilized his army, thus
kept the majority of the population
from voting and prevented Veulzelos,
the popular idol, from tnking the place
of power which his natural majority
of the electorate should give him. In
this way the Greek constitution was
defied by the king.
The entente powers could not stand
this long. They have forced Greece to
demobilize. With the soldiers voting,
Venlzelos Is almost certain to return
to power In the elections to be held

Then Constantine's power will cer

being driven from the throne alto-

If the Germans win the war they act

Lithuanian sections of the Russian em

many and Austria will carry self-abnegation
so far as to add their own
shares In the three partitions of the
unhappy nation to the new state.
Many candidates for the Polish throne
have been suggested. Perhaps the new:
king will be a Pole, but more likely a
German or Austrian of German blood.
If the allies win, Russia will frown
upon outside dictation of Polish af
fairs In the peace conference. She wilL
certainly take as big a share of Po
land as she ever had and is likely to
grab a little more. But economic re
forms have been promised by Russian
leaders to the Poles and Russia, unless
the reactionaries again come Into com

of Germany. Her neutrality has leaned

laugh at Swedish claims that the
Aland Islands, lying near Sweden In
the Baltic sea, may not stay fortified.
If Germany wins, Sweden will be suit
ably rewarded. It Is not thought the

Would Germany, victorious, return
his throne to Albert of Belgium? Hard
ly. If she did, It would be a shadow
of his former busy little kingdom.
Germany would demand control of the
port of Antwerp, the annexation of
territory on the east and the autonomy
of the Flemish-speaking provinces. If
Germany Is defeated, Albert's domain
and prestige will likely be increased
over what they were In that fatal July,
1014.
