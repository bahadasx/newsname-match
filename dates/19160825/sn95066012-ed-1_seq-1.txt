STRONG OFFENCE
MACEDONIA
Forced Allied Troops to Abandon
Position on Struma River
GEN. SARRAlL MEETS DEFEAT
His Troops Put to Flight With Heavy
Loss and Abandon Their
Supplies.
London. Aug. 25. The drive of tlio
Bulgarian army against the allied
ight flank on the Macedonian front
has apparently developed into a sharp
r clash with the entente forces and
reater losses to them than had prev
iously been indicated, judging from
the official report received from Sofia
yesterday.
k severe defeat was administered
to Gen. Sarrail's troops along the
Struma river northeast of Salonica,
Monday, the statement declares, the
ntente forces taking flight, leaving
many dead and abandoning quantities
of munitions and supplies, including
ight machine guns.
The Bulgarian forces have now en
trenched themselves on the east bank
of the Struma and along the highway
to Seres, according to the French of
ficial report yesterday. Their posi
tions hero lie in the way of an allied
idvance along the most direct route
into Bulgaria.
Iteports as to conditions along the
other sections of the front in the Bal
kans are conflicting. On the entente
side it is announced that the Servians
have successfully taken the offensive
along the western end of the line, cap
turing a bight near Lake Ostrovo,
while Berlin declares the Bulgarians
ire the aggressors, in the lighting in
this region. Apparently no important
movement is as yet in progress on the
center of the line, where the main
thrust of the entente is expected.
Defeat of the entente forces along
the Struma river, on th' Macedonian
front in northeastern Greece, was an
nounced by the Bulgarian war otllce
In a statement issued Wednesday at
Sofia. The statement says the en
tente forces took flight, leaving the
ground covered with dead and that
to the time the statement was is
sued the bodies of more than 4nu dead
had been counted. Large iiiantities
or ammunition and supplies, including
eight machine guns, are captured by
the Bulgarians.
London. Aug. 24. Both French and
'ritlsh troops made important gains
on the Somnic front today. I In
French have captured all of the village
of Maurepas ami advanced more than
200 yards to the east on a front of oik
ami a QU&rtar miles. The Bun di
who are blasting their way toward
Thiepval. a very strongly fortified po
litlon at the northern extremity of
their offensive, pushed their lines 300
yards nearer to the town. They cap
tured a German trench 4ou yards long
together with many prisoners, to
night's War Office statement lays,
The new French line east of Maure
pas extends from the railway north of
the village to Ijill 121. to the south
east. South of the Somme the otflclal
report mentions only artillery duels
Fnoflicial dispatches say the French
are shelling the German lines on s
front of about thirty miles, from Ks
treres to Uisslkny.
The French operations in the Ver
dun section today also met with sue
cess. A slight advance from Fleitry Is
reported together with the repulse of
German grenade attacks on the now
positions captured yesterday. The
day's total of prisoners In this section
was 3no. while 2t0 more were taken In
the .Maurepas operations.

LEGISLATURE
Special Session Also Provides Aid
for Fami'ies of Men at Front
MILITIAMEN TO GETS10 A MONTH
Increase of $3 Over Rate During
Civil War Because Higher Cost
of Living.
Montpelier, Aug. 24. With the ex
ception of two Senat' bills, providing
for the voting of soldiers at the pri
mary and regular elections, the Legis
lature has practically concluded the
business tor which it was convened in
peOlal session by Gov. Charles W.
Gates, that is, it will have completed
its duties by noon tomorrow, provided
the House and Senate get together on
the question of mileage as covered in
House Bill No. 1.
Die Senate passed House bill
providing for soldiers' dependent! ami
House bill 2, providing lor state pay
for soldiers, without amendment. On
the latter Senator Cady of Washington
ounty explained why the bill called
for $10 in place of $7, as was voted in
189S. He said the high cost of living
made it necessary.
Senator Simonds of Caledonia ex
pressed no faith whatever in the fed
ral bill for reliel of soldiers and tie
pendents which he declaied to be a
huge joke. The same bill, however
was amended in the House so that tin
governor, auditor and state treasurer
may reduce the compensation of de
pendents in case the federal govern
ment makes provision therefor.
The two House bills passed are as
follows:
11. 2 By Foster of Calais; to
pay all Vermont soldiers enlisted
in the federal service S10 a month
from June 18. 1916, to January 19,
1917; appropriates $85,000.
H. ; By Graham of Rocking
ham; relating to Vermont sol
diers In federal service; provides
payment of ISO a month to sol
dier's wife, $5 a month to each
child. 116 a month for dependent
mother. $16 a mouth for depen
dent father. $5 u mouth each
to dependent sisters and brothers;
terms of service the same as in
House bill 2; appropriate! $35,-
ooo
As the bill relating to mileage
stands at present it was amended in
the House to provide; for 10 cents
mile and $!'nun was appropriated for
miluage and debentures with authot
it y granted the state treasurer to bor
row $133,000 to cover appropriations
and other expenses of the special ses
sion.
The Senate, however, cut the mile
age allowance in half and reduced I lit
appropriations to their original terms
Apparently the House is determined
to have 20 cents a mile mileage as
the committee on mileage and debet)
tures Jones of Shrewsbury, chair
man reported that a consensus of
nine counties showed the members
practicully unanimous tor 2" cent ml
leagc.
Hedtield Proctor of Proctor called
attention to the fact that the special
session called for no trips hack and
forth. Hit thought P cents a mib
would bring the members oift about
even. Stone of Woodford, speaking
for faraway members, declared thnt
lo cents a mile would mean an actual
loss to Bennington county members
as the members from Senrsburg, for
instance, might require two days to
come and two to go. The House, bow
ever, voted for the Increased mileagi
108 to 48.
The Senate killed the Miller resolu
(Ion, undertaking to construe the pi
maty law in respect to the number of
names required on petitions for conn
ty offices, but passed House Bill 4
making effective the to-Called corrupt
practices clause. by changing the
word "less" to "more."
Representative Miller Introduced a
Joint resolution w hich was adopted, nf
ter some objection and a few opposing
votes, providing for a clearer Interim
tatlon of Section (1. subdivision B. Act
4 of the Acts of 1915, the primary law
The resolution sets forth that It was
the Intent of the Legislature to require
of candidates, securing signatures
when tiling cumllda'ios. 2 per cent of
the combined ote of the highest can
dldate in each party at the previous
election.
This Is a dilfereni interpretation
thahn that decided upon by the alter
hoy general who has insisted that the
law required the signatures of 2 per
cent of (he vote cast for all candidates
of till parties at a previous election.

ANOTHER CONFERENCE TODAY
President Meets With Brotherhood
Representatives But No Informa

Washington, Aug. 25. With all in
terested parties at loggerheads over
tho settlement of the threatened rail
road strike, President Wilson today
created some excitement by calling
the heads ol the Brotherhoods to the
White House. The conference lasted
for one and one-half hours and at its
close the workers stated that there
were no new developments.
It is apparent that the heads of the
railroad companies involved are un
compromisingly opposed to the grant

to believe that an agreement might
be reached on a basis of eight hours
work for eight hours puy.

One Front Wheel Wrecked on Bus
Which is Otherwise Damaged
BUS DRIVER NOT AT FAULT
Owner of Massachusetts Car Acknow
ledges Responsibility and
Agrees to Settle Loss.
The Bennington-Dorset auto-bus,
which left here at one o'clock Thurs
day afternoon was in a collision two
miles beyond Arlington which put it
completely out of commission. The
car was driven by A. J. Palmer of
Dorset and was only partially filled
with passengers, none of whom were
injured.
At the time of the accident, the bus
was going up grade and was neariug
the top when a heavy car bearing a
dealer's license came over the top of
the hill at about 45 miles an hour. The
road was narrow at that point and iu
order to let the car pass, Mr. Palmer
turned out as far as possible. Fven
going part way up the bank on the
side of the road. The approaching car
did not slacken its speed and locked
its back wheel with the front wheel of
the bus. The fender was ripped from
the dealer's car and the bus was badly
wrecked, all of the spokes being
knocked out of one wheel, the steering
gear broken, and the truck severely
bent.
The driver of the car, which bore a
Massachusetts license, admitted that
he was entirely at fault and gave his
name and address and agreed to set
tle the damages. A car was immedi
ately seut from the Arlington garage
and the passengers taken the rest of
the way to Dorset, thus causing no
break in the schedule. Several men
were sent up from the Bennington
Garage Thursduy evening and towed
back the injured bus which will bo

V seven passenger Studi baker was
put on the run this morning and will
be continued as long as the bus is laid
up unless another bus is secured.

the accident from being a much more
serious one.
