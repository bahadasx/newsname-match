Tuesday morning Frank Kindel, who
' was sleeping in one of the rooms over
I the Sweet Short, wus awakened by the
1 sound of glass breaking and at one
ar√≥se und located the noise at the
I Koberts-liearbome hardware store a
rross the street and at once went to
the Chinese restaurant and notified
' Curl Gordon who was there getting a
' cup of coffee. Carl at onco started
I with the special night man, Snell, for
I the hardware store and left Snell in
I front while Carl went to the rear door
supposing the robbers to have entered
, by the rear but about the time he got
i to the rear the robbers emerged from
I the front door. Snoll states that his
revolver caught in some wsy and he
could not use it, while Frank Kindel
yelled at the robbers and they answer
ed with a couple of shots from a sis
shooter. Frank and Snell were at th
stairway south of the Sweet Shop and
the bullets frosn the robbers' gun
struck the wall north and the second
shot struck over the entrance to the
stairway. By the time Carl got ag
round in front the robbers had gotten
north some distance but he pursued
them sd close that one dropped a new
double barrel shot gun in the street
in front of the Joyce-Pruit store and
then ran arross the street to the allay
east of the Thorne furniture store
where he dropped several boxes of
cartridges and took up the alley. Both,
seemed to turn and go south down th
railway toward San Jose and were fol
lowed by Gordon who after going t
a point not far north from the Mex
ican school stopped to watch for sormt
movement and it was mst long until h
noticed a Mexican and called for hint
to hult hut wus answered by a couple
of shots which he replied with a shot
or two, while the Mexican was run
ning. Shortly after Sheriff Stewart
and Fred Montgomery -were watching
around San Jose for suspicious parties
and found a Mexican hiding In a cora
field and arrested him as he was on
