Washington. Aug 19 Thirty-one
presidents and other executive off I
cert of the principal railroad systems
la the country, together with the com
nilttee of railroad managers, were in
conference last night discussing Pres
ident Wilson's demand that they ac
cept the plan for averting a general
rail strike which he has proposed
with the approval of the unions.
After several hours of debate the
carriers said that they had reached
no decision on the answer they will
render to the President this morning
concerning the compromise proposal
he submitted to them.
They will discuss the matter at a
meeting before going to the White
house, and they may decide to ask
the President for more time In which
to consider their reply.
The conference last night was
given over mainly to consideration of
tne auvisaDitity oí enueavoruiK iu m
luce the President to modify the
terms of the settlement plan. The
general opinion expressed was that a
further effort should be made to obey
a settlement recognizing the principle
of arbitration of wage disputes, which
is ignored by the President's plan.
The carriers would like to obtain a
modification providing for a nine in
stead of an eight-hour basic day. In
any event tney wouni line to ouiam
assurances that transportation rates
will be advanced sufficiently to offset
the Increase In wages. If compelled
tj yield, they will endeavor to fix the
rcFponsihllity upon the President in
way designed to procure his influence
favor of a rate raise.

hat If the eight hour day be estab-.
lied, the consumers will be asked to
ay the $50,000,0011 increased operating
x penses.
The 010 district chairmen of the
railway brotherhoods formally accept-
I the President's settlement plan by
four to one vote, and rushed thu
.rltten acceptance to the White
louse shortly after the railroad pres
idents concluded their conference
with Mr. Wilson.
The President expressed his gratifi
cation to the "big four" brotherhood
presidents who brought the accept
ance, and sum ne wouia insist upon
mmediate action by the railroad of
ficials.
Tho President's proposal was that
the railroads establish the eight-hour
day principle and grant pay at usual
rates for overtime Instead of the pay
and a half demanded by the men.
All other issues then might be re
ferred to a commission of probably
three members, one of whom would be
named by the President or some other
public representative, and the other
two by the employers and employes
respectively.
The railroad presidents, It is under
stood, want arbitration under tho
Ncwlands act with two arbitrators for
reads, two for the men and two for
the public.
