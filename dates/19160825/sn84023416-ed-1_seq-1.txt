ISLAND POND 30 YEARS AGO
Former Resident Tells of the
Peeplc, Incidents and Social
Affairs of tlio Village in
the Days of Long Ago.
Billerica, Mass., Aug. 17, 1916.
Editor Herald: As an old resident
of Island Pond and an employe of
the Herald for four years with Mr.
Bishop, I wish to extend you my
best wishes. The newspaper soil in
Essex county is very good but needs
cultivation like any other enterprise.
I would have enjoyed your Old
Home Week, for, while not a native
of Brighton, my wife and two chil
dren are, and I lived there -about
twenty years, locating there Janu
ary 1st, 1S82. My first introduction
to Island Pond was at a social in the
guild room of Christ church, when
the Rev. Mr. Cowper announced a
song by Mrs. Stevens, meaning me,
a bit embarrassing to a stranger.
During my residence in Island Pond
there were many events of interest,
some of which come to mind at this
time. Essex Lodge was locate over
the Clarke freight house; May 24,
1883 we went to Coaticook and in
stituted Victoria Lodge, I. 0. O. F.,
on the night of May 30, two of our
Brothers, Alec Cabana and John
Fowler, passed into the great beyond
in a railroad accident at Stratford
Hollow. Later on scores of railroad
men were involved in a suit against
the Grand Trunk railway company
by Henry Noyes, conductor of the
train in which our brothers met their
death.
One of the features of Island Pond
in those early days WF3 Bigelow's
orchestra, which for years added
fame to the town; D. P. MacKenzie,
postmaster, still holds the fort, and
I have no doubt, could swing a bow
in good shape still, if you stood a
bass viol up to him. Many Island
Ponders must remember the 4th of
July minstrels of various years, and
"Coley" Flaherty's famous oration.
Then there was baseball! Frank
Harmon with his noted curves, Char
lie Thurston, "Cuey" Donahue,
Tommy Griffin, the Browns, and
other stars. Great battles with
Gorham in those days!
I doubt if any New England town
ever had such an array of vocal tal
ent as Island Pond had twenty-five
to thirty years ago. Soprano, Mrs.
Pottle, Mrs. Penfold, Mrs. Stevens,
Mrs. Cades; contraltos, Mrs. Morse,
Mrs. Andrews; tenors, Mr. Gregory,
Mr. Laurie, "even me;" bassos, Geo.
S. Robinson, Almon Smith, Josiah
Cobb, were old standbys, with scores
of others I might think of if I tried.
Mrs. Linehan, Mrs. Cause brook,
Mrs. Rawson, Mrs. Reeve, were all
fine pianists, and these various nam
ed people, with some assistance,
rendered "Esther," and "Pinafore,"
and "Patience" in great shape. A
few years later "The Frogs of
Windham" was produced mostly by
a lot of singers who came along
somewhat later than those mention
ed. I presume the musical standing

of the town is still high, it might
well be.
When I first came to Island Pond
the Island Pond House had outlived
its career as a hotel; the dining room
was the hall for entertainments, and
the rest of the building was used for
tenements, for the Herald office, by
George N. Dale as a law office, and
Cheney's barber shop. Cheney would
stop in the midst of a haircut to go
fishing. Two big events in Island
Pond hall I recall are a session of the
Grand Lodge, I. 0. 0. F., I thhTk
about 1887, and a joint debate be
tween Hon. Ossian Ray of Lancaster,
N. H., and Thos. H. Brown of Rut

that, for we seldom found any satis
faction in those days.
This letter would not be complete
without a word in memory of John
Reeve, the "father" of so many
railroad men, who will never forget
him, without mention of "Wash"
Noyes, of "Oliver," of Thurston,
Andrews, "Lige" Davis, "Mart"

dear me, it's impossible to condense
thirty years into a few inches of
space. Island Pond has a past to be
proud of. Let me suggest that the
present generation so live that their
children, like the middle-aged resi
dents of the town, may call them
blessed.

CAN FRUIT WITHOUT SUGAR
Canning Specialists Say Boiling
Water May Be Used Instead
of Sirup.
Fruit for use in pies or salads or
as stewed fruit can be put up or
canned without the use of any sugar
at all, according to the canning spec
ialists of the department. They,
therefore, advise those who, because
of the high price of sugar.have been
thinking of reducing the amount of
fruit they put up, to can as much of
thei r surplus as possible by the use
of boiling water when sugar sirup is
beyond their means. Any f ruit.they
say, may be successfully sterilized
and retained in the pack by simply
adding boiling water instead of the
hot sirup. The use of sugar, of
course, is desirable in the canning
of all kinds of fruits and make3 a
better and ready sweetened product.
Moreover, most of the fruits when
canned in water alone do not retain
their natural flavor,texture, and
color as well as fruit put up in sirup.
Fruit canned without sugar to be
used for sauces or desserts must be
sweetened.
Canning Fruits Without Sirup
Can the product the same day it is
picked. Cull, stem, or seed, and
clean the fruit by placing it in a
strainer and pouring water over it
until it is clean. Pack the product
thoroughly m glass jars or tin cans
until they are full; use the handle of
a tablespoon, wooden ladle, or table
knife for packing purposes. Pour
over the fruit boiling water from a
kettle, place rubbers and caps in
position, partially seal if using ' glass
jars, seal completely if using tin
cans. Place the containers in a ster
ilizing vat, such as a wash boiler
with false bottom, or other recepta
cle improvised for the purpose. If
using a hot-water bath outfit.process
for 30 minutes; count time after the
water has reached the boiling point;
the water must cover the highest
jar in container. After sterilizing
remove packs, seal glass jars, wrap
in paper to prevent bleaching, and
store in a dry, cool place.
If you are canning in tin cans it
will improve the product to plunge
the cans quickly into cold water im
mediately after sterilization. When
using a steam pressure canner in
stead of the hot water bath, steril
ize for 10 minutes with 5 pounds of
steam pressure. Never allow the
pressure to go over 10 pounds.

JUDGE H. B. HOWE.
Praised hy Brooklyn Paper. This
Informal yet Dignified Ver
mont Judge Impresses Peo
ple and Lawyers Like
His Kindly Ways.
The Brooklyn Eagle devotes con
siderable space to the Vermont
United States judge, Harland B.
Howe, who was assigned to that dis
trict to help clear up a large conges
tion of business. It says he has cre
ated a profound impression by his
informality of manner, his willing
ness to unbend from the stiff dignity
of his office to converse with attor
neys as though the bench did not
separate them, and by his liberality
and democratic methods.
"I strive to make the atmosphere
of the courtroom free, indulgent
and considerate," said Judge Howe.
I belieye that all persons coming to
court should go out feeling that they
have been accorded courteous and
considerate treatment and if they
havn't won their case they have had
fair treatment.
"I have always maintained that
the judges should be the most hum
ble and most tolerant persons about
a court house. Why should a man
who has become a judge be other
wise? Why shouldn't he be more
considerate and more humble than
before?
"Just because a man is a judge
and has got a lot of power he should
use it very sparingly, and that is the
plan I try to follow."
Direct from his native district
where as he expresses it, he is a plain
country man, Judge Howe came to
Brooklyn at the request of the pre
siding justice and the brief period
on the Brooklyn bench that has just
ended has revealed to the astonished
and delighted members of the bar
that his honor practices what he
preaches.
Judge Howe's arrival banished
that frigid and restrained atmos
phere from the court room at once.
His informality and pleasant manner
in discussing cases with lawyers and
witnesses made litigants and repre
sentatives in trials feel at ease, and
the sombre surroundings of the trial
room actually seemed to brighten up
as though sunshine had been let in
through the windows.
Had it not been for the fact that
his honor wore his judicial robes and
that the courtroom furniture and
fittings were part of the scene, the
trial of cases before him might have
been taken for an impartial and
friendly discussion, free from re
straint, due to th elevation or rank
of one of the participants.
Yet with it all he combines a digni
ty that in no way sacrifices the con
ception in mind's eye among laymen
and members of the bar and bench
of what a judge, in his outward de
portment, should stand for.
' Chief among the beneficiaries of
the jurist's friendly style of conduct
ing trials, have been the lawyers.
Everyone familiar with court room
procedure knows how much the pre
siding judge's attitude influences a
lawyer's conduct of a case. Under
the informal spell of Judge Howe's
presence lawyers in cases before him
astonished even themselves with the
lack of restraint and freedom with
which they brought out. their cases
"I have been shamefully abused
during my twenty years as a member
of the bar practicing before judges,"
said Judge iiowe, and 1 made up
my mind that if I was ever elevated
to the bench I would not tolerate
bui h conduct on my own part.
In some instances I have known
young lawyers, at the very stage
when they needed the most encour
agement, to go into court and be so
abused that in some cases they have
gone out of the courtroom never to
return.
I always criticised the courts
when I was a practicing attorney,
iat 1 .1 . '
and 1 nave Deen tne victim or some
such shameful treatment. A judge
in my opinion, should be the most
humble and most tolerant person
about the courthouse."
Not only in his attitude, but in his
manner from the legal standpoint,
did Judge Howe create surprises.
When a prisoner, after a trial, is to
be sentenced, Judge Howe takes
both the district attorney and the
counsel for the defense into his con
fidence as to the nature of the sen
tence, leaving nothing to his own
judgment.
Asking first what penalty the gov
ernment piosecutor thinks adequate
and then the same question of the
convicted man's counsel, he arrives at
a conclusion that brings satisfaction
all around.
"Why shouldn't I do this?" he
asked. "The district attorney and
the counsel for the defense have
both the same standing in court.
Why shouldn't I seek advice as much
from one as the other? When I was
practicing I seldom or never had a
judge ask me what I thought would
be an adequate fine or penalty for
my client, though he has always
sought the opinion of the govern
ment prosecutor. In pursuing my
present course I believe I am going
to get pretty nearly the right re
sult."
Although the Vermont jurist has
