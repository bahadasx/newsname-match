The question of improved highway#
Is a paramount one today in Iowa. It
has been knocking at the Soor of pub
lic opinion for some years, of late so
very insistently that It can no longer
be elbowed to one side. The State
Fair will offer excellent opportunities
for pursuing investigations concerning
this problem and will doubtless help
many individuals to reach logical
conclusion. The Highway Commis
sion's exhibit will present a number of
completed sections of roadway, gravel,
concrete, asphalt, brick, etc. Methods
of construction will also be shown, to
gether with all kinds of roadmaklng
implements and road building machin

ville are all under contract to furnish
music for the occasion.
COW TEST EXHIBIT
FOR STATE FAIR
Arrangements have been made to

feature and one quite as practical as
novel, an innovation in the world of
fairs. It will be under the manage
ment of the Iowa State Dairy Associa
tion, working in conjunction with the
officials of the Dairy Department of
the Iowa College of Agriculture.
This demonstration will hold a world
of interest for the man engaged in
dairying or the one who is contemplat
ing embarking in the business.
In this exhibit a group of ten cows
will be used, cows that have taken part
in a cow test experiment conducted
the past year by a local association.
The entire plan of^rocedure will be
demonstrated individual records will
be presented showing Just what each
cow consumed during the year and
what she returned in the way of milk
and butter fat It will all be present
ed in such a way that the lessons
will be impressed. To the man con
templating the addition of dairying to
his activities this demonstration' will
be well worth a trip across the state to
see. It will be staged in a commodious
tent with ample room and accommoda
tions for visitors.
