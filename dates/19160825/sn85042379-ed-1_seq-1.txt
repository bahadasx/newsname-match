Judge Utter
Who gave you your Citizenship papers
asks your vote for District Judge
August 29, 1916, on the Re
publican Ticket.
Nothing occurring in the degrad
ing fight Judge Utter is making for
re-election has so aroused the indig
nation of the people as the circulation
by him of cards bearing his picture
and the matter printed above.
Upon a proper showing of compli
ance with the law any person is en
titled to naturalization papers. Jujlge
Utter did not "give" anyone citizen
ship papers. The court in which he
presides has made orders admitting
various persons to citizenship. He
has attempted throughout the cam
paign to use the power of his court
to gain the favor of voters and to
destroy opposition.
"Judge Utter who 'gave you' your
citizenship papers asks your vote."
Did he make the order because he
expected you to vote for him ? Was
he playing politics then? Does a
Judge who is paid $4,000 a year and
traveling expenses do you a favor
when he decides a matter in your fav
or when you are entitled by law to
such decision?
All over the district naturalized citi
zens resent this insult to their intelli
gence. Such unseemly conduct of a
judge merits the unlimited condemna
tion which he is receiving. If elected
his "court will be conducted in the fu
ture as it has been in the past." He
should not receive your vote.

PROHIBITIONISTS DISGUSTED
WITH JUDGE UTTER
The fact that Judge Frank N. Utter |
has taken a sudden turn in favor of
prohibition and the fact that he has
just recently appeared in several towns !
in Sheridan county as a temperance
orator, has caused no little stir in
politics.
The bills announcing his speech for
Plentywood last Monday made an es
pecial appeal to the women of the
community to be present and hear
what he had to say relative to the sa- !
loon in connection with local politics.
Why he should call upon the women in '
that intance for has caused more
cuandry than anything else that has
ever occurred in local political circles,
\ cause a large portion of his talk
dealt with men dead, and also a few
nu viler cases . th;jt have occurred in
Judge Beverley and Justice Evans
have had much of their court's time
occupied in dealing with this rather
lawless band of wanderers. Drunken
ness and disorderly conduct has been
the chief grievance, but a number of
robberies have been reported. John
Smith, now in the county jail on a
charge of disturbing the peace, claims !
that he was robbed of nine dollars and
a watch near the west end viaduct,
Henry Hudson was brought before
Judge Evans Monday charged with
robbing: Barney McKay of $42 in the
west end of town Saturday night.
There was not sufficient evidence to
warrant holding him however, and
Judge Evans gave him thirty minutes
to get out of town. Hudson had
brought another with him as a wit
ness, one E. A. Shea. Shea appeared I
before the court in a considerably in- 1
toxicated condition, and while Hudson

Sheridan county. As a result many
of the women who attended were dis
gusted with his talk.
Judge Utter has heretofore rather
been considered with the "wet" ele
ment, for when he was elected four
years ago he was then endorsed by
the state liquor dealers association.
His sudden outburst now in favor of
prohibition immediately after the
county option petition had been de
nied has led some to believe that he
is making a play for the temperance
vote, believing that he would carry
his former saloon support.
At Plentywood people are of the
opinion that Judge Utter's play is
purely a political move, and consider
ing that true, a great many people
have become greatly displeased, for
they are positively against anything
that would tend to pull the judiciary
into low grade politics.
Over in Valley county, the judge's
home county, the feeling is running
high, according to the newspapers
over there, and it looks now as though
the voters of the district generally
were determined to elect a man for
the judgeship who keep sacred the
dignity of the position, and who will
give his people fair, just and impar
Judge Utter and the
Prohibition Question
In 1912 Jud «e utter was endorsed by the Liquor Dealers As
sociation of the State of Montana. During the campaign that
year letters were sent by this organization to saloon men over
the entire district advocating the election of Judge Utter and
the defeat of John Hurly. Utter has endeavored to explain by
stating that the letter in question was written by a personal friend
of his to a friend in Glasgow. Insofar as the Courier can learn,

I Campaigned among the saloon men assuring them that he would
1 be "alright" in the event that he was elected. During the early
part of the campaign he even went SO far as to take J. M. Kennedy,
! the state secretary for the saloon organization, for a ride in his car
;
practically every saloon man in the district received one of the
letters. Were they all friends of this personal friend of Judge |
Utter ? I

ror the first few months of the campaign Utter vigorously

I the three counties, comprising the seventeenth judicial district, for
him.
The records will show that when the first Sheridan county
option petition was up he heard a mandamus proceeding affecting
the rights of the "DRYS", and refused to rule on the matter, for
no other reason than that he was afraid he would lose the saloon
«UPPort in that county.
Since his falling out with the liquor forces he has essayed
j the part of the street fakir, rolling into the different towns over
i the district with his automobile, he toots his horn, waves his arms,
suited to fill the judicial bench. So far a 8 we can learu he has|

Both Plaintiffs and Defendants Receive Fine When
Neighborhood Squabble is Aired.
Ed M. Peterson and Ernest Hincks,
who have homesteads adjoining each
other near Baylor, were arraigned in
Justice Evans' court Tuesday after
noon on complaints filed against each
olher and both sides of a biUer family

more than a year were thrashed out
by witnesses for both sides with the
assistance 0 f counsel. The trouble
arose some time ago> when difficulties
C0 „ C erning the grazing of cattle led
to a hand-to-hand encounter between
the two men and the arrest of H incks
on a comp i a j nt fii ed by Peterson, on
which Hincks wàs found guilty
the justice court at Opheim. The ill
feeling reached a climax July 3rd,
when Hinck's cattle came over on Pet
erson's homestead and mixed with a
tial service, practicing true economy
always.
If the Pioneer Press may judge j
from current comment the surprising,
stand in favor of prohibition is acting i
like a boomerang.—Plentywood Pion

A good sized crowd of people at
tended Judge Utter's prohibition
speech at Plentywood Monday, a great
many of whom no doubt went to as
certain if possible the reason for the
judge's sudden outburst in the inter
ests of prohibition, now that county
option has been disposed of in Sher
idan county. Whether it made the
judge any votes or not is difficult to
tell, but judging from comment the
people here, the same as everywhere
else, are not anxious that the judicial
ermine should become besmirched in
the mire of politics.—Plentywood
Pioneer Press, August 17th.
In looking over some of our ex
changes we notice that Frank N". Ut

mother came over to drive them back,
and Peterson having given Hincks a
severe beating some time before, they
came prepared for emergencies,
Hincks carrying a large rock tied in
a handkerchief and a screwdriver, and
Mrs. Hincks carrying â fence pole.
Peterson claims that when Hincks and
his mother had separated their cattle
from the bunch they set their dog
upon the remainder, and Peterson in
an endeavor to head them off ran past

prohibition speeches, of which we
would have admired Mr. Utter for if
he had done so before the campaign
period had set in. Why do you sup
pose Mr. Voter, he had neglected to
advocate this during the past three
years of his term ? Simply because
he was in favor of the saloon, or at
least he believed in buying drinks
while he was out canvassing, but since
then he has had a falling out with
some of the saloon keepers in this
district and figures now that he needs
the vote of the Prohibitionists to
pull him through the primaries. It
is high time that the voters of this
district take notice of what is going
on in the county and cease to let some
of these office-seekers pull the wool
over their eyes so easily..—Frazer

had gotten away and broke into a

the cows she would be unable to sup

THE JUDICIAL FIGHT
We regret that it is necessary to
take up the judicial fight. We had
hoped that Judge Utter and his
friends would keep from it. Without
cause or provocation Judge Utter has
slipped loose his dogs of war on Mr.
Hurly. We are honest when we say,
we regret Judge Utter's action in the
matter, but we have faith in Mr.
Hurly and -hall stand for his defense.
