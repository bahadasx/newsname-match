their advance into Greece and evacu
ate part ot the captured Greek ter
ritory, according to an unconfirmed
dispatch from Home this afternoon.
Several Greek generals have re

advance, the dispatch stated. Instead
of retiring they have prepared to de

continued their advance in the past
forty-eight hours. After advancing
nearly thirty miles into Greek terri
tory and occupying Kastoria, the Bul
garian right wing made no further
progress.

WILLL'HAD SAFE AT NEW I.OMlON
Tug. Supposedly Waiting for Bremen.
Defies Allied Patrol.
Ity foiled Press.
NEW LONDON, Conn., Aug. 23
Nosing her way through a fog, while
the little tugs snuffed and snorted
alongside, the North German Lloyd
steamer Willehad swung into the pier
of the State Ocean Steamship Com
pany here today, adding another chap
ter to the German defiance of the
Allied warship patrol off the Atlantic
Coast.
Customs officials and all New
London believe the coming of the
Willehad forecasts the early arrival
of the merchant-submarine Bremen
from the German port of that name.
The Willehad had made the trip
from Boston without escort. Coming
through the Cape Cod Canal and
thence out to open sea, the liner trav
ersed more than fifty miles of her
journey through a zone in which she
was subject to attack or capture had
enemy ships sighted her. She sailed
beyond the .1-mile limit but was not
molested.
It is believed here that the Willehad
is to serve in the same capacity for
the Bremen as the Neckar in Balti
more harbor did for the Deutschland.
The Bremen's cargo probably will be
transferred to the Willehad, which
will act as a "mother ship" for the
submarine, housing her crew while
they are in port and also protecting
the submersible from enemy eyes.
As the Deutschland was nestled
close to the Neckar, with a protected
tug on the opposite side and a wall
and a barge acting as barriers at
either end, so the Bremen probably
will be smuggled into the pier along
side the Willehad here.
Interest was increased this after
noon by reports from Baltimore that
the Tug Hcnsa, formerly the Tim
mins. of Deutschland fame, was to
leave that port, carrying a barge
loaded with rubber and nickel. There
is as yet no. positive information as
to when the Bremen will arrive, but
all indications are she will put in at
this port.

CRUMBAUGH DIES WILSON
IN A FULT0NH0SP1TAL
In Bad Health for Years.
Death of M.U. Custodian
Not Unexpected.
WAS 58 YEARS OLD
Every Student and Faculty
Member Was Friend to
Familiar Figure.
James Edmund Crumbaugli who
has been custodian of University
property for several years, died at
5:30 o'clock lasi night. His recent
illnes.i was short-lived, but he had
been in bad health for several years,1
and his death was not unexpected.
Recently Mr. Crumbaugli became,
very ill, and was taken to a Fulton .
hospital, where he died yesterday. He,
received a sunstroke several years'
ago, and from this he never complete
ly ri covered.
He was born in Columbia, and
spent most of the 5S years of his life
in this city, where he was known by
every student and member of the fac
ulty in the University.
After receiving a public school edu
cation, .Mr. Crumbaugli entered the
University, graduating in 1879. He
then studied law and practiced for
several years, holding the offices of
city attorney and justice of the peace
during this time.
Becoming interested in handling ex
hibits, he left his profession and en
tered into the interesting work of pro
curing and managing exhibits at fairs
and expositions. During this part of
his life, he had charge of exhibits for
this state at the fairs of Omaha, Port
land. Charleston, Buffalo, St. Louis
and Jamestown. He was appointed
to a similar position for the Panama
Pacific Exposition, but resigned on
account of his health.
During the past few years, Mr.
Crumbaugh held a position with the
University. He was interested in per
petuating the memory of old teachers
and students of this University. It
was through his interest and his ef
forts that many of the pictures that
are now seen in the corridors and in
the alumni room were secured. He
was well known to all the students,
and every year brought him a new list
of friends, with whom he had grown
to be a part of the institution. On ev
ery special occasion he could be seen
contributing his services to make the
occasion a success, and the manner in
which he protected the campus from
forgetful tread showed the love he
held for the University and its tra
ditions. He was the son of the late Henry
Crumbaugli, one of the prominent pio
neers of Boone County. He is sur
vived by three sisters. Miss Cornelia
Crumbaugh. a local school teacher,
Mrs. J. V. C. Karnes and Mrs. J. H.
Lipscomb of Kansas City.
Funeral services will be held at 10
o'clock tomorrow morning at the
home.

H, R, El
President Indicates He Will
Stand by Trainmen in
Their Demands.
ROADS ARE WORKING
Are Having Telegrams Sent
Urging Arbitration, Say
the Brotherhood.
Ity United Press.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. With
President Wilson and the railroad
presidents apparently hopelessly at
loggerheads in their efforts to prevent
the threatened strike, the President
today stirred up excitement by sud
denly calling the heads of the rail
road brotherhoods to the White
House.
The conference with the brother
hood chiefs lasted an hour and a half,
adjourning just at noon. According
to the workers' representatives, how
ever, it left the situation unchanged.
They were asked to accept no com
promise, they said, and given the im
pression as they left the White House
that the President would be expected
to stand firmly by the proposal which
they have accepted hut which the rail
road presidents refuse.
The brotherhood men while at the
White House placed before Wilson the
charge that a nation-wide campaign
is being conducted to influence senti
ment in favor of the railroads. They
presented telegrams to show that the
Northern Pacific is paying for favora
ble messages forwarded to Washing
ton. Want Favorable .Messages Sent.
The following message, the brother
hood leaders say, was sent by Super
intendent DeRorco of the Northern
Pacific to all agents of their road:
"It is highly important to get the
trainmen question talked by farmers,
stoVk-raisers, dairymen and mer
chants. Please get many of these
classes in your town and vicinity to
send telegrams rush to President
Wilson at Washington, urgently re
questing him to settle the controversy
by arbitration. Telegrams should show
the business of signer. The tele
grams are to be paid for from station
funds and statements sent me for
voucher, your credit. I want you to
send copies these telegrams to me
by wire as soon as transmitted to
President, using our own wires for
this. Might be well to have some of
the prominent signers send messages
to their Congressmen, Senators,
Washington, in addition those sent
President Wilson. This very impor
tant and must be given preference
over normal business today."
The pressure from their members
for prompt disposal of the issue with
the railroads is becoming strong, the
brotherhood men told the President.
The brotherhood men deny specif
ically they had been asked by Presi
dent Wilson to consider possible leg
islation by the present Congress.
"The situation is just rocking
along," said A. B. Garretson of the
conductors' brotherhood.
"There will be no compromise."
A meeting of the railroad presi
dents lasting from 11 a. tn. to 1 p.
m. resulted in the announcement that
they had agreed on no proposal to
make to the President, and would con
vene again sometime later this after
noon. .MAY PIT IN JOURNALISM COURSE
