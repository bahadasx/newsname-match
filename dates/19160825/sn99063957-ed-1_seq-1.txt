FEELING IN GREEK
NATION IS SEETHING
Rumania's Position Arousing
Much Interest and Course
Is Closely Watched
London, Aug. 25. Germany has or
dered the Bulgarians to discontinue
their advance into Greece and to evac
uate occupied Greek territory, fearing
Greeoo will be drawn into the war, ac
cording to an unconfirmed wireless dis
patch from Rome today.
Several Greek generals have refused
to obey orders to evacuate eastern
Macedonia before the Bulgarian ad
vance, the dispatch said. Instead of re
tiring they have prepared to defend the
eastern Macedonia front. '
The Greek government is said to have
laid this information before Germany,
Adding that public indignation over the
invasions has increased to such an ex
tent that the government is no longer
master of the situation. Upon receipt
of this information Germany ordered
the Bulgarian withdrawal, it was stat
ed. The Rome report thus far is not eon
firmed from any other source, though it
is a fact that only iu eastern Mace
donia have the Bulgars continued their
advance in the past 49 hours. After
advancing nearly 30 mileB into Greek
territory and occupying Kastoria, the
Bulgarian right wing made no further
progress." Official dispatches from Ger
jnnn, French and British war offices at
tributed this halt to the stubborn Ser
liian resistance.
The latest Athens dispatches appar
ently contradicted the Rome report,
stating that the Greeks are evacuating
the region around the city of Seres, un
der orders from the Greek government.
Russians Beady to Invade.
Budapest dispatches, reporting the
concentration of large bodies of Russian
troops on the Bessarabinn-Rumauiaa
frontier, evidently with the purpose of
crossing Rumania to invade Bulgaria
and Hungary, aroused intense interest
today. The Budapest newspaper Az Est
was quoted as declaring that the Ru
manian war party is becoming stronger
and that the Rumanian government has
made tentative preparations at the fron
tiers, making it easy for the Rumanian
forces to co-operate with the Russians
if Rumania is drawn into the wnr.
Recent United Tress dispatches from
Berlin asserted the Russian diplomats
are bending their energies at present,
not to obtaining Rumania's participa
tion in the war, but to obtaining per
mission for Russian troops to cross
Rumania to attack Bulgaria and Hun
gary. French Report Successes.

another chapter to German defiance of

out beyond tho three mile limit but was
not molested.

General Haig reported to the war

Off Manomet Point, the Willehad
sighted a suspicious looking craft head

near the shore. The Willehad 's pilot
had received orders that if approached
by hostile craft she should be beached.
The Willehad is tho first interned

By Perry Arnold.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Laramie, Wyo., Aug. 25. Save for
t
wo days rest at Bridiiehampton, L. I.,
immediately at the conclusion of his
present campaign trip, Republican
Nominee Hughes will be continuously
on speaking tours from now until elec
tion time.
According to tentative plnas which
have been forwarded to the candidate,
he will set a now record in campaigning
if he is physically fit to follow out the
itineraries which are now being con
sidered for him.
Today the governor thought he would
be able to go through with every de
mand for his presence because he was
feeling so fit. It is the nominee's hope
that he will be known personally to a
majority of the voters of tho United
States.
By the time he has finished his pres
ent, trip he estimates that he will hnve
been seen and heard by about 1,000,000
people. After he has completed other
iuuimiKii iuuis, niiicii 11 IB BU1U, will

of tho Uuitod States, the republican
standard bearer hopes he will have been

Portland, Or., Aug. 25. A quarter

I demanded from the Southern Pacific
and Oregon Klectric railroads by the
Willamette Valley Lumbermens associ
ation, according to plans made today.
The lumbermen say they have been
damaged to this extent by failure of
the railroads to supply them with
freight ears.
At a meeting of the association in the
Imperial hotel today, J. N. Teal, at
torney for the organization, was in
structed to file the suit as he might
see fit. Federal mandamus proceed
ings may be instituted first.
The lumbermen assert there has been
discrimination against them in the dis
tribution of ears. Thev face a serious
shortage which will result, it is de
dared, in closing a large number of
mills unless there is speedy relief.
OF LIVING
Miss Kaufman commented at the open
ing that even now she didn't see the
"wrong of this life."
Attorney Smith explained to her that
her testimony would result in the prose
cution of Kugelman.
Miss Kaufman then told how she met
Kugelmun through a girl friend. The
love making that foiluwed did not pass
the bounds of propriety for more than
a year, Miss Kaufman said. She be
came deeply in love with Kuuclmnn and
believed his story that he would marry
her as soon as the rich lather he told
ner about, died.
In November, 1914, Miss Kaufman
began to live with Kugelman as his
wife and then she learned that there
was nothing to the "rich father" story
and that Kugelman had been married
at Atlanta. Kugelman begged forgive
ness and added that he needed money.
She gave him the $10 seh made each
week as stenographer but he said he
needed more. She refused at first to
consider his method of getting more
money, but finally consented. Ho in
structed her to walk on certain streets
and to use certain hotels. She said she
did as she was ordered and was never
molested by the police.
Makes $90 a Week.
Miss Kaufman told how she returned
home every afternoon at S o'clock and
tnen at 7 took her place on the street.
She gave him the $10 she made each
stenographer and as a slave averaged
$90. She retained enough tor herself
to buy food and clothing and turned
over the remainder to Kugelman. She
continued this for two years without
a protest until she learned that Kugel
aian this week married a womau in
Brooklyn. Then she consented to tell
her story to the district attorney.

SPEECHES
tween teams at Cincinnati, on Septem

ing to arrange for a mass meeting at
the railroad station during that time so
that the nominee can make a rear end
of the train speech.
From Cincinnati the Hughes' party
will go diroct to Maine. The first speech
on his invasion of the Down East ter
ritory will occur, according to present
tentative plans at York Harbor, on the
afternoon of September 7. That night
Mr. Hughes will address a big gather
ing at Portland. On September 8, it is
planned to have him seak at Lewistoii,
in tho morning; nt Waterville in the
afternoon and at Bangor at night. This
would leave him two days before speak
ing at Syracuse on the 11th.
According to these arrangements, it is
probable the two days will be occupied

fore the election the nomiuee will con-

(United Press Btnff correspondent.)
Washington, Aug. 25. With Presi
dent Wilson and the railway presidents
apparently hopelessly at loggerheads in
their efforts to prevent the threatened
strike, the president today stirred up
excitement by suddenly calling tha
heads of the railroad brotherhoods to
the White House.
The conference with the brother
hoods lasted an hour and a half, ad
journing just at noon. According to
the workers' representatives, however,
it left the situation unchanged.
They were asked to accept no com
promise, the brotherhood chiefs said and
gave the impression as they left tha
White House that the president might
be expected to stand firmly by the
proposal which they have accepted, but
which the railway presidents refuse.
lbe brotherhood men, whilo at tha
White House, placed before the presi
dent the charge that a nation-wide lob
by is being conducted to Influence sen
timent in favor of the railroads. They
presented telegrams to show that the
Northern Pacific railway is paying for
favorable messages fo. warded to Wash
ington.
Want Popular Sentiment.
The following message, the brother
hood heads said, was sent by Superin
tendent J. L. Derorce, of the Northern
Pacific, to all agents of his road:
"It is highly important to get tha
trainmen question discussed by farmers,
stock raisers, duirymen and merchants.
Please get as many of these classes aa
possible in your town and vicinity to
send telegrams rush to President Wilson
at Washington, urgently requesting him.
to settle the controversy by arbitration.
Telegrums should show business of tha
sender. These telegrums are to be paid
fijr from station funds and statement
sent me for voucher your credit. I want
you to send copies these telograms by
wire as soon as transmitted to the presi
dent, using our wires for this. Might
be well to have some of the most prom
iueut signers send message to their con
gressmen and senators in Washington in
mum ion io tnose sent to 1'resideut Wil
son. Ibis is very important and mast
be given preference over normal busi
ness today."
Men Become Impatient,
The pressure from their members for
prompt disposal of the issue with tha
railroads is becoming strong, the broth
erhood men told tho president. W. O.

ion, showed the following telegram,
