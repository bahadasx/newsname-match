HAVE OKLAHOMA DAI
At a meeting held yesterday the
board of directors of the Southwest
Fair Association decided to observe
a day to be known as Oklahoma Day
at the coming fair.
Thursday, September 14, was se
lected to be advertised and celebrat
ed as Oklahoma Day. Arrangements
have been made for the merchants of
Liberal to close their stores all after

The program for Oklahoma Day
will Include a good strong race card
of four or five events, a ball game,
1and concert, balloon ascension,
parachute drop, open air comedy, re
volving ladder act, open air Juggling
act, not to mention a good line of
concessions, including Ferris wheel,
merry-go-round, motordome, tidal
wave, big tent show and a number of
other attractions.
In addition to this, the Fair Asso
ciation has arranged with the Ne
braska Feature Film Co. to have an
operator on the grounds during the
fair to take motion pictures of the
Taces, ball games, balloon ascension,
principal stock exhibits and the
crowds of people in the grand stand
and on the grounds. These pictures
will be advertised at a later date and
shown in Liberal at the Majestic The
atre. The merchants should all prepare
'to decorate their windows for the
day; Thursday, September 14.

NEW ATTORNEY IN TOWN
Mr. and Mrs. Eugene W. Davis ar
rived Sunday from Kansas City,
Kansas, and will make their home In
Liberal from now on. Mr. Davis is
an attorney by profession and will
open a law office here in the near fu
ture. He was formerly connected
with the district attorney's office in
Kansas City. He is a graduate of the
law department of Kansas University
and has the appearance of one who
can make good. Incidentally Mr.
Davis is a Democrat in political faith,
and a Democratic lawyer In Liberal
will be quite an innovation.
fall illinery
Last spring and summer was by far the largest millinery season we have ever had. Our
Millinery Department grows by leaps and boundswhy? Because we believe in securing the
best trimmer and designer to be had for this department and always give them positive in
structions to deliver
The Very Best in Style and Quality
On as Little a Margin of Profit as Possible
as we consider our millinery department the biggest advertisement we have. Our New Fall
styles are in and we have surpassed all previous efforts in assembling this fall stock. In
variety of shapes and range of price, we' think our showing is unsurpassed in this or any
other town in this great Southwestern country. We have been very fortunate in securing
Mrs. Pearl Deurmeyer, a trimmer and designer of much experience to take complete charge of
our Millinery Department for fall, and she will be pleased to meet you any time.

ADDING NEW FIXTURES
. W, E.. Wilson,, who .recently moved
his grocery stock to the Craig build
ing on Second street, has found his
move so satisfactory In the way of
new business that he has been com
pelled to add a few new fixtures to
properly handle the same. He has
this week installed a modern com
partment refrigerator that carries all
the latest agonies In the way of sav
ing a clerk's time, and will in the
next few days have an automatic
chese cutter, a computing scale and
a large National cash register. Be
sides this he has been compelled to
Increase his stock to take care of his
trade. Mr. Wilson says business con
ditions have been better with him
than any former year since he has
been here, notwithstanding the short
age of wheat production and the
drought that has prevailed all over
the state during the past summer.

Can you look at your watch and
know that it is correct? If you
have a good watch that' doesn't
keep time, come in, we will guar
antee to make it do so; or, if you
are in need of a good one, our line
of Hamilton, Howard, Elgin, and
Waltham watches is complete in
every respect. A call will convince.

DR. NICHOLS BACK TO LIBERAL
. Dr. Roscoe T, Nichols and family,
will return to Liberal and remain
permanently. Two years ago, Dr.
Nichols accepted the position of med
ical examiner at (he Kansas State
Agricultural College at Manhattan,
and disposing of a number of per
sonal effects in Liberal, moved bis
family to Manhattan. The change to
the new home, with the great school
advantages, the social opportunities
and the nearness to the larger cities
had the attractions, but as Dr. Nich
ols has related, the opportunities for
his making money at his profession
were limited. He received a living
salary for his services at the college,
which required all his time and at
the end of the year he found that he
was not progressing as he bad been
when he had a practice at Liberal.
And then, too, he believes that there
Is a greater future In his profession
In Liberal, where he has an extended
acquaintance, than would ever occur
In the limited sphere at the college
at Manhattan. The position at Man
hattan is a good one for an old man
who does not desire to expand in his
work and could be content with a
salary, but Dr. Nichols Is as yet
young and ambitious. The call of
Liberal became too urgent for fur
ther resistance and before the school
term begins, the Dr. Nichols family
will be at home in their residence
on Washington avenue north. Liber
al will welcome them.
HARVESTING BROOM CORN
Broom corn harvest has started all
over the country this week and the
Chamber of Commerce is receiving
many calls each day for pullers. The
corn is of very good quality and there
promises to be a good crop. Men are
quite plentiful and the average wage
is $2.00 per day. The Chamber of
Commerce office is also receiving a
good many calls for men to do gen
eral cleaning around the yards. ' This
Is an excellent time to do a little
cleaning up and there are plenty of
men waiting to take the Job.'
BIG PARADE WILL DRAW
for the second day of the fair prom
ises to run far ahead of all expecta
-tlons. Up to the present time there
have been a very large number of en
tries assured and at this early date
the showing is remarkably good.
The people surrounding Liberal
have a big treat In store for them,
as there has never been anything of
this kind held at Liberal. Other
towns with greater population have
had parades of this nature but it is
the first time for Liberal, and so far
as we know not many towns of Lib
eral's size have ever undertaken
anything of the kind on a large scale.
From present Indications the
parade will have thirty or more cars
of floats decorated for advertisements
by the merchants, and nearly that
many decorated by others for beauty
alone. Then there will be comic
floats and rigs of every description.
The prize for the most comic rig
or float is $10 and for the prettiest
float or car, $10, but no car that is
decorated for advertising purposes
is eligible to compete for either of
these prizes.
A good many of the merchants and
others have already placed their ord
ers for decorations. Those who are
going to require any paper flowers
or other special decorations should
take the matter up at this time, so
that there will be no delay at the
last minute.
IT FINALLY RAINED ,
Ths Mpljjwho had figured X
Pluvlus as having gone into eternal
retirement have been surprised twice
since our last Issue. On Saturday
night Liberal received .28 of an inch
of rain and early Monday morning a
half inch fell, making a total of .78
of an Inch. This was not a toad
strangler by any means, but when
you consider the dry weather the en
tire state and the whole southwest
have bad during the past summer
you will realize it Is quite a relief
anyhow. We believe the excessive
heat has been broken and from now
on It won't be quite such a hard Job
to keep going. The country both
north and south of Liberal report
heavier rains than we received here,
but the little that fell here will be
enough to help the row crops won
derfully and put the land in fair
shape for plowing.
. WILL RE-ESTABLISH STAR
ROUTE
Postmaster E. S. Irwin has this
week received Information from the
Fourth Assistant Postmaster General '
that the star route formerly conduct- (
ed between Liberal and Hugoton will
be re-established on September 26. '
The route will be from Liberal by
Ematon to Hugoton, returning by La
fayette to Liberal. It has not yet
been decided whether It will be a
daily or a trl-weekly service, but bids
for either will be received by Post
master Irwin or the Fourth Assistant
Postmaster General up to September
12, after which date it will be defin
itely decided by the Post Office de
partment as to the number -of trips
made per week by the carrier. This
Is the old route that was discontinued
after the Santa Fe began operations
through Stevens county. As the mall
service to Hugoton at this time is a
rather slow procedure, having to go
around by way of Dodge City, the
people of both towns and the farmers
living between here and Hugoton
' have kept up a continual fight tor the
're-establishment of this route, with
the result that the departmental red
tape has been sufficiently unwound
to start the ball to rolling. It will
be a decided convenience for both
towns and the people who are to be
served by the route, -TJj
