GLARING HEADLIGHTS
The Lancaster Examiner says:
glaring automobile headlights
blinded the driver of an automobile
on Saturday night, causing him to
crash into a telephone pole, killing a
young man." That is only one case
of the sort. Carrying these glaring
headlights on automobiles is not only
unmannerly, Insolent and unlawful,
but murderous; and no government
that respects itself or its people will
permit it. W would about as lief
meet a hlghwaymairand his revolver
as one of these glaring headlights.
Many a time quiet and law abiding
people have to steer their autos to
the curb in order to let these mon
sters pass. One would think these
men who carry the glaring headlights
would have respect enough for them
selves to quit it. Ohio State Journal.

SUN BROTHERS
Well Known Circus Will Show Here
Sept. 1!, With High Class Perl'oiin-
is and Trained Animals
Strange sights and still stranger
animals will bo among the many
tilings that will be unloaded when the
big show train of the Sun Brothers'
World's Progressive Shows arrives in
Celina on Saturday, September 2.
r- This is the date of the appearance
here of this well known amusement
enterprise. Long before dtuvn the
railroad yards will be the center or
attraction for the younger generation
or town and many a household will lie
startled from its peaceful slumbers
at an unseemly hour by the tinkling
or the alarm clock under the pillows
of the small boy. In fact, a few com
fortable beds will be left undisturbed
throughout the entire night, their us
ual ocupants preferring to remain
awake and thus run no risk of miss
ing the opportunity of witnessing the
arrival and unloading of these great
shows. The Sun Brothers' Shows for
this season have an all new equip
ment and brand new plethora of acts
and performances in all its depart
ments, in fact it can truthfully be
said that it is an all new show. The
only recognizable thing of its past
season is the adherence of their old
time policy of never allowing at any
time or place any gamblers, sure
thing men, confidence games, fortune
tellers, dancing girl show or anything
in the nature of a roper-in-device.
These issues have never been tolera
ted with this show nor will they ever
be countenanced. Two complete per
formances will be given here during
their engagnient and the assurance
is made that both performances will
be presented without any curtailment
whatever. Many new and novel free
outside exhibitions are offerd this
season and are said to be of an unus
ually entertaining and "thriller"
character.

and liabilities of the concern, had not
been filed up to yesterday afternoon
it Is, however, estimated that the lia

Not only was the town surprised
by the failure, but the many clerks or
the store, who were not apprised of
the matter until t"y arrived at work
Monday morning.
The Anthony store is one of the
eldest business houses of the town.
For the past twenty years It had been
known In this section as a great re
tail center. Close competition In the
last several years, however, cut down
the business of the place, and for
more than a year past the financial
standing of the firm had been ques
tioned. The community at large regrets the
ends to which Mr. Anthony was forc
ed but hope that adjustments can be
made in such a way that business will
be continued at this well known lo

Sol Slick's
Kane of Syossct Laments the Repub
lican Candidate's Loquacity On
Subjects He Knows So Little
About
"Well, I see Hughes has taken to
kiddin' himself," said the Hon. Sol
Slick, of Syosset, L. I., today when he
and read the speech of acceptance re
cently delivered by the Republican
aspirant for the Presidency in New
York City before T. Roosevelt and
hopeful adherents. "I sure waded
h rough the most of that stuff, an'
believe me, any guy that can talk
that way, ain't safe at large. Take
it. from me, bo, there's words in that
tuff that Hughes pulled betore Roo
sevelt that you can't ever make me
believe Teddy would have mouthed,
an' you know that when it comes to
sayin' things T. R. has a mouth of his
own.
"What got my goat, though, was
th' stuff on Mexico and what Hughes
avs he thinks Wilson made a bone-
head on. I didn't notice anywhere
where Hughes showed how the play
could have been made any different.
Ever been down on the border? No?
Well, then don't swaller all this dime
novel stuff that's bein' pulled about
al them Mexicans bein' easy marks.
Forget it. Say, if Hughes can t talk
mora sense, about other things than
he did about th' Mexican game, he
orter take a night school course some
where west of the Allegheny moun-
lins. All th' knowledge of the
world isn't back in little ole New
York, even though a guy can get dis
covered there and given a good job
as a judge. Just bein' a judge ain't
nothin' in particular; gettin' guys
out of the jug is more trouble.
'Knockin' don't do no body any
good. I read- all that stuff that
Hughes had to pull, an' believe me,
if any kid came into my place and
howed he knowed so little about
Mexico. I'd make his fade, an' nobody
ever heard of me chasin' any kid. Ye
know, I kinder thought Hughes was
a goin' to say somechin'. I kinder
thought he, d be there with th' jab,
n' th' jam, upper cut, right and
left double-cross, an' then with Roo
serfelt in his corner, handin' out a
wallop that'd he the K. O. But say,
it makes me weep. It s a joke.
"In th' first place when a guy
thinks he knows so much about some-
thin' th' thing for him to do is to
make good. If I wanted any man's
ob, I wouldn t expect to get it by
goin' to his boss an' knockin' him, an'
tellin' that I seen him out one night
with a Jane when he didn't know
hether he was windin' a clock or
puttin' an automobeel to bed. I
would't go around hollerin' that I
had somethin' to tell on him, an' then
when I got all the crowd around,
back up an' say that 1 d heard a lot
of stuff from a guy from Kentucky
who went out to New Mexico broke
and now owns everything he can get
his hands onto out in that country,
an' all th' mines he's been able to cor
ral down in Ole Mexico.

shops where they could have
their horses chod centers
where they could get work done.
It was the farmer himself who
suld that ho wanted a locul cen
ter. Take away the locul center,
the small town with the schools
the amusements, the churches
the country stores and the rail
road station and what have we
left? We will develop our agri
culture just as we develop com
munity centers, and when we
separate them we tear down the
rubric of rural life. WJien we
bring them together, we build
up a stronger agriculture and a
better country life. Prof. li. I.

GROCER WILL UXGEREK VEUY
ILL RE 'OVEKY DOUBTFUL
Mrs. Win. Ungerer, West Fayette
street, was severely burned about the
lace by boiling hot soup Wednesday
afternoon. The hot liquid splashed
in her face as she was removing it
from the stove. She wears glasses
and this feat probably -saved her
eyes from being badly burned.
Her husband, Wm. Ungerer, the
south Main street grocer, still contin
ues in a serious condition, with but
slight hopes of recovery.
Soliloqy
to tell what was wrong because I
knew it an' could prove it; an' be
lieve me' I'd come across or expect
to be run out of town. You kin bet
cher life I'd have th' goods on the
other guy down to th' last case, an'
I'd be there for straight across th'
board, show, place and win. I'd
show th' boss of th' job that I could
do what th' other fellow couldn't do.
If I s aifi a guy was w, ong, believe me,
I'd prove it, an' 1 wouldn't waste no
two coiyuti.s in a newspaper tryin' to
make good.
"I didn't see anywheres where
Hughes offered to go down on th'
border and take a little ole chance in
th' melee himself, did you? I did
n't see where he was so anxious to
help th' Mexicans by going down
among 'em and make 'em behave th'
way he says he'd like to see 'em be
have. If he could give up the best
job he eve rhad to take a bum chance
on gettin' elected President, it seems
to me that he could have taken a
week or two off, and taken a run
down to Mexico City or El Paso, or
wherever it is that he thinks the
worst is to come, and straighten out
th' whole darn trouble. He might
stop at Juarez, too, and see if he
could place a bet!
"But he never said a word. Even
th' Colonel offered to get up a whole
army and go down and whip the Mex
icans if anybody wanted him to. Ye
see, the Colonel may be all you think
he is, but he knows the game, an,
when he talked about fixin' the Mex
icans ye never heard him talkin'
about any trip down there unless he
took an army with him, not just a
regiment or two but a whole raft of
'em. Ye see, Rooserfelt knows that
a greaser when he's real riled can eat
more red hot peppers and drink more
mescal wiht scorpions in his liquor
than any other guys what he knows
cf. An' makin' peace down there
just by deliverin' a speech in New
York is just about the safest way
that Hughes will ever tackle th' Mex
ican question, you belive me, bo.
"I seen too where he hollered be
cause Myrun Herrick, that Ohio guy,
ain't one of them plenitentiary am
bassadors over in Paris anymore.
Kin you beat it? Who t'ell cares
what millionaire get3 this job, any
how? J'ever hear of any of us com
mon people getting to be ornery am
bassadors or high priests to any one
of these here foreign courts? Not on
yer life. If Hughes thinks anybody
but him cares about that other guy
haftin' to come home to play ping
pong and Paris mutuels instead of
continuin' on the French circuit for
another season, he's got another big
guess a-comin'.
"On th' square, I ain't got nothin"
agin Hughes, but if he ain't got no
more to say than he had to say th
other night, and it takes as long to
say it an' he don't get no farther
than he did then, he couldn't even
tend bar for me. An' I've had some
barkeeps that knew so much that
they'd almost weep if they thought
they'd be late in gettin their wages
down to some bookmaker. Hughes?
Huh!"
CITY
Dads and Mayor Threaten to
Step Down and Out
Funds to Ran Municipal Machin
ery Insufficient -Matter Up to
Budget Commission.
Unless the County Budget Commis
sion-County Auditor Steinbrunner,
Treasurer Benke, and Persecuting
Attorney Myers see Ot to grant the
demands of the Finance Committee
of the Village Council In Increasing
he Budget Levy from 1.3 mills to at
least 2 mills every member of the
present council and the Mayor will
probably resign their Jobs.
In making up the levy the Budget
Commission divided the five mills al
lotted the corporation and schools for
general running expense as follows:
Schools 3.70 mills; corporation 1.30
mills.
Under this levy division the cor
poration wouiu gei aooui ouuu or
unnlng expense and the schools
about 117000.
While this division will raise suf
ficient money to run the schools. It
falls far short of caring for the
wanst of the town, the salaries of of
ficers alone totaling almost nine
thousand dollars, or three thousand
dollars more than alloted by the pre
sent budget evy. Granting $3500
additional collection through liquor
license levy the council would have
only sufficient means to pay expenses
of office saaries.
Over and above this is the expense
of running the fire department, po
lice department, street cleaning de
partment, Board of Public Affairs al-
owances, Legal advertising and the
ke which amounts annually to about
$4000.
The Mayor and finance committee
this week took up with the Commis
sion the matter of more evenly di
viding the levy. Dr. J. E. Hattery,
president of the Board of Education
was also present at the meeting and
objected strenously to having the
school levy reduced.
The Commission failed to give tne
corporation officers any satisfaction,
and this, yesterday prompted the
Mayor and Council to : nnounce they
were willing to close up snop unless
granted at least a sufficient levy to
properly conduct the village affairs.
Four years ago tne levy was almost
equally divided; three years ago the
corporation was cut to a little better
than 2 mills; two years ago u was
again reduced o 1.70 mills; last
vear the school board raised a kick
for more money and the town levy
was cut to 1.50 mills. The climax
came w hen the attempt was made to
reduce it to 1.30 this year, when at
the same time he corporation had a
deficit in all funds last year, amount
to about $2,000, while the school
board had a baalnce of something ov
er $1900.
This balance in the school fund
was utilized to repair the East School
building, while several thousand dol
lars more were borrowed to cover the
work, which will amount to about
$6000.
Had the school board cared for this
by a bond issue as they should the
present trouble woudl not have aris
en as the amount they ask for in their
levy is made sufficient to replace hte
money expended for th East building
improvement.
HOT OXE HAXDEI) GOSSIPS
Mendon Herald.
We are of the opinion that police
ought to raid dens of gossip as they
do gambling dens. There is quite as
much harm done in the one as the
other. There are loafing places and
other places of meeting where human
character is not rated as worth more
than the snap of your finger. The
inmates of those places delight in
turning the faintest suspicion Into
the foulest kind of slander. A little
blunder they magnify into a huge
sin. One's very appearance Is sub
ject for the w hole colony of gossipers
to dissect, and you are pulled to piec
es and reconstructed with their slimy
hands in no time. Old Satan him
self could not do a better job of dis
figuration. Then this distorted view
of yourself is spread out where all
can see in these dissecting rooms. It
may be vulgar, it may be indecent,
it may be malicious, it may be ridic
ulous, it may be cruel and hateful
and what not, but there it is for all
to gaze at. It is not long before the
young folks step in to hear and see
the latest risque and shady talk and
"views." Their minds are soon filled
with the poison of it. Their interest
In home life and a good book is given
up to sit at the feet of some villifler
of character, and right there, often,
they get started up on the wrong
career. The graduate from a gossip
den will never be of much force in
the world. . We say again, set the po
lice on such places.
