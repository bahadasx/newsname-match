ICAGO, Aug. 25.?Edward W.
iaon, the 80-year-old recluse
so vanished millions are the sub
of an investigation before Judge
dis in the United States district
1 was declared today to have lost
irfy valued at 55,000,000 to a cot
crie of strange characters within the
past 20 years.
| Francis J. Houlihan, counsel for I
dorrlson's creditor, declares that un
tpulous lawyers, women and habi-1
? of the Chicago underworld came
unto the life of the aged man whose
ilth is estimated from $3,000,000
f8,000,000 to obtain his money. He
I taken on trips to other cities. At
_ney Houlihan declared women were
nought to see him and new characters
oduced to keep his fortune dwind
ng.
'ar<5h of the recluse's quaint old
y i story home in which it was
hought he had concealed vast sums of
noney revealed $11.73 in cash and a
i of old papers, cancelled checks
notes. In ono package almost
JjO U's" written in various hands
unsigned and which totaled some
ling over $150,000 were found.
"No trace of deeds, titles or other \
?records of ownership to property said
Hp be worth $6,000,00 were found.
[Investigation to the affairs of Mor
ion has shown that James R. Ward
sel for the aged man is holding
> than $2,000,000 worth of property
nveyed to him by Morrison.
, One of the queer turns of the story
i that which tells of the adoption, by
Morrison of Alice and Anna Burnstein,
^ughters of a junk man.
Jy adopting the two girls the rail
lalre who has lived like a recluse
fice he returned from the civil wnr
excited the animosity of certain
JfelaUves and public spirited citizens.
Sjjplt Morrison makes the girls heir to
-wealth, amounting to $10,000,000,
the city of Chicago will be deprived of
, great public school.
. When Morrison's father died he be
queathed his woalth to his son on
condition that if he died without heirs

Optimism Over
Strike Situation
Disappearing in
Washington
Roads Will Make Back to
Wall Fight for Arbi
tration
(By Assoclnted Press)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.?Tho rail
road strike negotiation resolved itselt
today outwardly at least, into a more,
or less coufused state. Expression of'
optimism from 1 oth sides were not so
free as they were yesterday and feel
ing heretofore general among the
managers that a plan to include an
eight hour day would be found was not
so evident.
Some of the railroad executives re
verted t'o their prediction that it never
would be concedod.
President Wilson kept the cabinet
waiting an hour while he conferred
with tho four Brotherhood heads. All
parties to the conference steadfastly
refused to say what was talked about.
The railroad executives conferred
among themselves during tho day and
it was thoughtfpOBfllble they .might la
ter go to the White House. For the ex
ecutives this statement was issued:
"Tho executives are understood
' to be studying the form of a com
munication to tho President"
j Some of the more optimistic still
jhave hopes of a final decision being
reached before tomorrow night.
The opinion that the eight hour ba
I sic day will not be conceded apparent
I ly was growing as the conferences
continue.
The executives and managers devot
ed practically no time too ay to con
sideration of freight rate increases or
settlement of future strikes, but cen
j tered on the length of working day
and pay.
Many executives are willing to con
| cede an eight hour day witn an under
standing that it shall not only be the
I maximum work day but also the min
imum in other words, that the present
: practice by which an employee ina>
| get pay for a day and a half or even
two days, whon he works only ten or
twelve hours will be eliminated.
: The brotherhood heads declared they
'are standing on President Wilson's
plan and had not changed their atti
tude a particle.
As the conferences among the rail
way executives progressed it was said
tho presidents wore standing more
closely together for arbitration than
at any time since they had assembled
here and that somo of those who at
first wero for accepting President Wil
son's plan bad been brought over to a
majority which was described as
standing "back to the wall."
i It was indicated that the communi
j cation be.vg prepared for President
Wilson would contain a furthor insist
ence on arbitration.

Entire Paid Attendance for
Week Reached Almost
Twelve Thousand.
Many wild guosses were current on
the streets today estimating the size
of the crowd ttaat attended the Fair
mont Fair yesterday on the last day.
Most of these estimates placed the at
tendance between twelve and fifteen
thousand, many persons also stating
that the number of automobiles park
ed on the grounds would reach at least
one thousand.
Estimates as usual were entirely
wrong according to the statistics pre
pared today by <ue auditing depart
ment of the assocaition. The entire
number of paid admissions yesterday
was but 8,695. Probably 400 persons
went into the grounds on passes of
various kinds including all of the prir*
ilegc and horsemen. This would bring
the entire number present yesterday
up to about 9,000. Of this number
about three thousand came to the
grounds in automobiles, vrtiile 6,481
passengers to the grounds were hauled
during the day by the Monongahela
Valley Traction company. Of this
number only 6,140 wore hauled back
to the city. It is likely that the num
ber of passengers carried that failed j
to pay their fare and thus not being in
cluded in this count reached several
hundred.
The entire number of automobiles
that paid admission yesterday was but
414 while probably 50 additional cars
were admitted on passes or to deliver
groceries and supplies while perhaps
50 taxis camo in after four o'clock to
haul passengers back to the city.
The entire number of paid admis
sions for the week reached 11,537 and
532 automobiles paid to enter the
grounds during the three days. This
showing is much btetter than either or
the two previous Fairs, held on the
local grounds, as the rains of last year
and the year before kept tne crowd
down to very small proportions.
The Fair officials today are in the
main well pleased with the result of
the meeting and arenow planning a big
ger and better Fair for next year. A
plan is now under consideration for
the holding of- a running meeting on
the local track which will last for an
entire week. The date of this has not
been fixed but will likely be late In
September or October.
