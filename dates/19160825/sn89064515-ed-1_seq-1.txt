VOL. 28
COMMISSION STATES THEY HAVE
RECEIVED NO INFORMATION
OF SELECTION OF ROUTE
St. Cloud Journal-Press (23): Is
the much located and re-located Jeffer
son Highway to be given another
-chase around the circle?
The following significant statement
appears in the official publication of
the Minnesota Highway commission:
"Information has been received at
"this office through correspondence and
•press reports that the so-called Jeffer
son Highway has been located through
our state by a representative of the
Jefferson Highway association as fol
lows: From the twin cities, norther
ly along the Mississippi river to Lit
tle Falls thence northwesterly to Sta
ples thence through Wadena, Park
"Rapids, Red Lake Falls, Thief River
Falls, Hallock and St. Vincent.
"No official notice has been given
the highway commission, nor was any
invitation given that body to join in
the designation of the route, and un
til official action is taken it *s pre
sumed} that the designation is still
pending. If any official notice is
given, the matter will be considered
at the next meeting of the highway
commission, if no such notice is giv
en the highway commission will con
sider the resolution suggested at the.
last meeting. This contemplates the
location along the so-called loop
route.''
This looks very much as though our
'worthy highway commission had a
chip on its shoulder.
The Jefferson Highway has been
the storm center of much keen com
petition in the northern section of the
state, and it has been tentatively lo
cated, hoisted in the air, changed by
resolution and then shifted back to its
iirst position.
The pine to palm highway was lo
cated by the directors from several
states, from New Orleans to the Twin
Cities.
The route from there to the Cana
dian boundary was left to the Minne
sota Highway commission, it was an
nounced, and maps prepared showing
the location from Minneapolis to Win
nipeg, by way of St. Cloud, Little
Falls, Wadena, Itasca Park* and Be
midji and then north.
Long Prairie started a campaign to
have the route changed from St. 'Cloud
to go by way of Sauk Centre and
Long Prairie, to Wadena. This arous
ed other sections, and a big meeting
was held in St. Paul with the commis
sion, and there were advocates of sev
eral different routes, one by way of
Princeton, Brainerd, Cass Lake "to Be
•midji. Another was west from Sauk
Centre to Alexandria, then to Detroit,
Moorhead and up the Red river.
After mufclii' agitation, the Minnesota
liighway commission apparently side
stepped, and it was announced that
the final selection would be made by
•General Manager Clarkson of Mis
souri. ]n company with other officials
of the association and representatives
of the Minnesota highway commission
all proposed
kroutes
were inspected.
tion of the so-called Eastern and
Western routes, leaving Little Falls
out in the lonesome.
Manager Clarkson ignored the rec
•ommendation of the Minnesota com
mission, and proceeded to nail down
the route as originally designated.
The towns and counties along the
route have paid their assessment of
$9 a mile, and the matter was suppos
ed to be settled.
Now comes the Minnesota commis
sion with its bomb, and indicates that
it proposes to change the route, in
accordance with its resolution, desig
nating the loop plan, on the plea that
the commission has received no offi
cial notice.
It certainly should receive this no
tice, and Manager Clarkson should
get busy and do the courteous.
There is evidently a well developed
ease of friction between the Minne
sota commission and Manager Clark
son. 0
It is hoped they will settle their
differences and not embroil the north
em section of the state in another
controversy.
MAKING INSPECTION OF JEFFER
SON HIGHWAY
Little Falls was visited on Wednes
day by J. H. Beek of St. Paul, vice
president for Minnesota of the Jeffer
son Highway association, who is mak
ing a tour of inspection over the high
way in this state.
In a conversation with J. K. Mar
tin, president of the Jefferson High
way committee for this county, Mr.
"Beek slated that-he was highly pleas
ed'with the work that, has been done
on the highway in this county thus
far and he said that he was very glad
that it was routed this way.
Mr. Martin accompanied Mr. Beek
and Mt. Reid, also from St. Paul, who
