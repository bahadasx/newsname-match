"Entirely Up in Air," Declares One
of President's Advisers "We're
Sitting Tight and Won't Compro

Accused of Lobbying.
(Special From a Stiff Correspondent of The Evening World.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25,-Thc livening World learns on goo.i
authority lh.it the sub-committee of three railroad presidents empowered
to consult with President Wilson over the controversy with the railroad
Brotherhoods will go to the White House this evening with something
in the, nature of an ultimatum.
This proposition will embrace the stand of the railroads that they
cannot accept the eight-hour day principle without assurances that freight
rate increases to meet the increased cost of the eight-hour day be guar
anteed and that the Administration commit itself to pass through Con
gress a bill for compulsory arbitration.
Inasmuch as President Wilson has''
committed himself to the eight-hour
day and tun recommrnilcil that the
Mllroads accept It pending Investiga
tion as to the tuUtltlonnl co.it. tlio
