THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
The only special event of significance
in the progress of the war in Europe for
the past week has been the opening of
operations on the Greek frontier. Here
for many months the entente allies have
been gathering a large army and vast
stores of munitions. In this allied army
there are British, French, Italian, Ser
bian and Montenegro soldiers, while
fighting against them are Germans,
Austrians, Hungarians and Bulgarians,
while Greece on. whose territory the
operations are being carried, seems divi
ded against itself, part of the nation
wanting to join the allies and the other
part are either in sympathy with the
Teutons or wunt to be neutral.
There are unconfirmed rumors that
Roumania, which has so long bung in
the balance, will now join the allies. If
they do it will add some 300,000 or more
well drilled soldiers to the already strong
armies of the allies.
It is understood that of the Teutonic
forces on the Greek frontier that tbe
Bulgarians form tbe greater part of the
army.
The allies have made some advances
from Salonika along a 150 mile front.
They have been quite successful along
the center of this line but reverses are
reported at both ends. Whether this
new movement is successful or not in
"making progress" it will at least keep a
large army busy in opposing them which
seems to be the plan of the allies in this
campaign.
It would look at this time, whether
they are right or wrong, that the allies
believe Germany to be near the point of
exhaustion, either in men or munitions.
The allies for two years mostly have
been fighting on the defensive with the
avowed intention of wearing out the
Tuetons. Now they have taken the
offensive at all points and as we note,
bis week have added another point of
attack.
The plans of the allies may be shatter
ed in two ways. The Teutons may be
able to win important and decisive vic
tories over one or more of the different
allied armies and thus again take the
offensive. Or the Teutons may have re
berves of men and munitions that
wiI
allow theua to hold baek tbe allies for an I

indefinite time in the future. To over*

win some decisive victories in their turn,

are won at a cost that makes them al

~TWE OLD GA1*G.*»
Recently a Fargo newspaper referred
to the Pioneer Express as one of the
"old gang .papers" etc.
This.writec, personally, is rather proud
to fee cre«lited as an .associate of tbe men
who are 'called by many by the in tended
insulting name of the "old gang."
As a writej in the newspaper field for
thirty years what this writer has stood
for and what ihe has opposed is printed
in the files of this paper. (Looking back
ward at this time we have little to re
gret and little that we wish to have ex
plunged. Personally, the newspaper
man writes bis own autobiography in
his daily
or .weekly issues.
But the men with whofn we associa
ted twenty, thirty and some forty years
ago are icocwn to this generation as the
4'old
gang Most of these men are now
lying in their graves. A few still live
but practically all of them are out of
politics. Most .men have or ought to
have the common decency to let tbe
dead rest. But that word "gang" is rol
led in the moutti of the political dema
gogue as a sweet morsel. It insinuates
so much and means so little. When the
demagogue says "gang" he means all
that is mean. The epithet includes
every possible political crime and prob
ably includes all the crimes on thecrimi
nal calendar.
Who composed that "old gang?"
They were the pioneers. of the then
territory of Dakota and later of the new
states of North and South Dakota.
They were the legislators and terri
tonal and state officials. They were the
business men, the professional men, the
farmers and in those times this new
state was mostly located in the Red riv
er valley. They were the men who
built up Fargo, Grand Forks and a
thousand smaller towns. They were
the men who turned the first sods of the
unbroken prairie and who helped build
the net-work of railways that opened up
this wilderness and rescued it from the
Indians and buffalo.
That these men ran things in thos9
early days much to their own liking is
certainly true it had to be true because
there were no other persons to run
things. But the supposed theory that a
certain few men combined to run things
political and otherwise for their own
special benefit, without reference to the
good of the territory or state, is a lie.
In the first place the political combi
nations were such as are made in a,ny
year in any state or locality. Then as
now, but more then because of new con
ditions, new questions were constantly
arising aud consequently new combina
tions were being made. But at the pre
sent day, these are all lumped into the
significant term of "the old gang."
In those early days Dakota was situ
ated politically like Texas or any south
ern state is now. There was but one
political party. Nominations at the
state conventions meant certain elec
tion. That any set of men in those
early days controlled without question
the republican party is nonsense. The
fights at the state conventions in those
days were something of the dramatic
and approached the tragic. As a result
tbe "gang" for the ensuing two years
were those who bad won out at the last
state convention. Sometimes it was
one set and sometimes it was another—
but then as now it
was
"the gang-" For
then as now success politically
waB
itt
I termed by the defeated as "the gang.'
Who were these men?
Personally thegr wen very. mnoh
other human bein|s. In tact their
terity aow living ia this state show
•HfMl humM oharaeteristica. BoB»j
Mmm men drank whiskey. You
ber ttria oonaeetion that
fent Liaoata wished that ha knew
Grant that these men were as bad
the tens "old gang" insinuatea grant fc#
-we mast that these men ia these eaty
yean controlled the destinies of
young state grant as is oertain thi
theee-gangsters and gamblere and wl
key drinkers started aad steered
Bhip.of'State, th^n
we mast also graftt
that the present state at North Dakota
was begun, by them. W« must grant
that these gangsten laid the foundation^
and helped to build this treat state.
Tbepp "profane gaqgeters" were the
men who helped to build the churches,
these "lawless ones" made the statutes
which are now kept so well that crimi
nality is less than ia almost any other
state in the union.
But we canuot longer specify. If
these men, "the gang" ran things in
those early days then the verdict must
be when we look at tbe present North
Dakota, that they did well. And if it
were true that these men were as bad as
insinuated, that they did so well is some
thing of a paradox. 4Can any good
come out of Nazarath?" If these bad
men did so much good then they cer
tainly deserve just so much more credit.
But these men were not bad men. Afi
we said they were human They had
their faults. But they were great big
hearted fellows, always ready to help a
friend, just as they were always ready
to fight a political enemy. They were
liberal to a fault. They played politios
just as they Would play a game. They
had their rules of honor, they would
give and take and lose without a kick—
but in no case has the word "grafter"
ever been applied to any one of them.
As we said most of these are dead
Their work lives after them. As they
lie peacefully in their graves over them
rises the great state of North Dakota^
No men, no set of men have a greater
monument. This great building whose
first stories are just completed and'
whose future extensions will form an edi
fice so broad and so high that it will
equal that of any sister state—is built
on tbe foundations laid by that bad
gang."
Sometime this state will honor the
men whom the thoughtless sometimes
call 'the gang" and history will tell the
truth about the men who laid these
foundations so broad and deep.
This writer was never one of tbe gang.
He never had the brains or the power ito
be a political leader. He has no share
in the beginning of things in this state
except as the editor of a local weekly
paper, but .as a humble helper he was
and is glad that be was connected with
the "gang" that started things right, in
this glorious "state of opportunities"
good old (new) North Dakota.
THE STRIKE SITUATION.
As we write on Tuesday the situation
of the railway strike stands about this
way:
President Wilson has assumed the
powers of an arbitration board without
the consent or request of either bf the
contending parties.
He has decided' that the men should
be granted an eight hour day.
He has told the railroad presidents of
the country who have assembled at
Washington at his request, that unless
they grant the brotherhoods the eight
hour day that the United States will
Step in and run tho railways.
That if that step is taken that all un
organized employes of the roads from
presidents down will be commandered to
continue to perform their usual duties.
That any other questions of pay, ets»
•£jK ift -|r

it was therefore these "whiskey drink'
era" that gave tbU state at its very on
set,.the best and strictest prohibition
daw that exists on the statutes of any
state in the union. It was these "gam
blers"' that so planned and .protected the
«chool land funds that in a few years no
other state will have se great an interest
bearing fond for tbe support of schools
as the state of North Dakota. Eduoa
itionally their only mistake was the es
tablishment of too many schools of high
er learning at the beginning, and if took
careful financing to keep these schools
running, and as a matter of faot they
went down into their own pockety to
.help out or some of the schools would
havs had to close.

thataie in dispute may he settled by
arbitration later.
That tbe brotherhoods an aati
with the decisions of the president
without saying, hot if he had deofa
on anything else they would doubj
still have gone on the strike—as
managers an at this time pnparing to
The railway employers have all along
and still insist on arbitration as the
only fair meaas of settling the rights
and wrongs of the mattera in dispute.
All per ties in the dispute agree that
the result will be an inorease in wages
if the deaaaads «f the men are granted.
The only variance is how much, the men
claiming that it will not be very great
while the railway managen say that it
means some fifty million ot dollars.
Apropos to the latter proposition
oomes the question of the inorease in
freight and passenger rates, as ihe rail
way managers declare that increase in
expenses other wise would bankrupt tbe
roads.
Hunce uuder this reasoning the whole
matter oomes down to we", ihe people.
"We must pay tue costs," which Presi
dent Wilson arbitrarily decides is not a
mailer of arbitration.
The position taken by President Wil
son is a difficult one and to some extent
at least, hardly logioal. He has assumed
the power to dictate terms to the man,
agers. He has threatened them with
force, and gone so far as to say tnat he
will force other railway men to act who
are not directly concerned in the pres
ent dispute.
li
President Wilson has this power, if
President Wilson is right in exerting
such extraordinary power as to the man
agers, why has he not the same power
over the brotherhoods? Why does lie
not treat theui both alike? If he can
compel either body to submit to his own
arbitrary decisions why cannet be com
pel them both to take their difficulties
before afegular arbitration board?
If he can commandeer the managers
to submit to his own management why
cannot he also commandeer cue uiucum
hoods to submit to an arbitration board?
Politically the President will doubt
less gain many votes among the labor
unions by hie arbitration. The people
however, who will pay the bills, want
something more than Mr. Wilson's per
sonal opinion. Mr. Wilson may be
right but the public who pay want to
know more about this eight hour day.
They are perfectly willing to pay the
extra freight bills if the brotherhoods
are not getting all the pay that is com
ing to them.
But tbe public want to be shown.
Mr. Wilson's opinion is that of a single
man, even though he is president.
There are lots of people who doubt the
infalibility of president's judgment.
They have seen it fail quite often lately.
There are phases of the disputed mat
ters in which honest men may differ,
In such cases, in all other mattera we
go to regular tribunals for settlement,
These do not always settle things exact
ly right because they are composed of
human beings—but as individuals, we
have long ago learned that it is the only
possible method of settling disputes
without fighting—and even a wrong dec
ision is far better than force.
If President Wilson through his arbit
ration later become the president of all
the railway systems in the country,
what with other matters, including a
political campaign, he will be a very
busy man during the next few months.
La,ter- Yesterday morning's dispatches
say, "The railroad chiefs have decided
to make terms with tbe president as
champion of the union, and are ready to
yield the eight hour day with the under
standing that tbe carriers shall be grant
ed advances in friegbt rates sufficient to
offset the increase of wages granted to
employees."
All of which definitely settles the
point that President Wilson has arbit
rarily decided that the American pub
lic shall stand for what managers say
will cost §50,000,000, without asking tbe
public whether they are willing tc pay
