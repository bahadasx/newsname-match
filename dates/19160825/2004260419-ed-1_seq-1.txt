Asl: tho avorngH uutoist coming
from Autorlu over tho Illghwu'y how
the roud lis und tho rnspoiu.o' will he
"Pretty good;" "Fair;" "Hum," etc.,
tho aiiHwer usually depending on
what kind of luck ho Iiuh hud with
his car nnd tlron. Ho to soo Just how
Iho road Is mid whut work Is being
done and reuli.lng that Homo of our
local aulohils will muko tho trip this
juuiiiior, u Mint representative drove
a cur tho round trip from St. Helens
to Brasilia, and tha following uro
IiIh observations of tho road;
From St. Helens to Uoblo It is
good, und driving leisurely one
.should muko this twolvo miles in 4 5
minutes. I.euving Uohlo for Rainier,
you encounter two miles of very
rough road. If It Is dry weather
I hero uro deep ruis and numerous
humps. In wot weather, and wo
traveled It right after a heavy ruin,
one should have chains, for you only
gel out of one mudholu before you
pluugo into another, and the cur
skids from side to uido of the roud.
Tho remaining four milc3 Into Rain
ier is good und will permit 15 to 20
miles per hour without discomfort.
I.euving Rainier go out I'nlon
stieet. There uro severuf blocks of
his sttcct leading to the hlghwuy
which nro in hud condition, but the
lilghwny itself l good und you cun
make tho long grudo on high gear
Tho eight miles to Helena is good
and mostly rocked. Turn to the left
at Helena and go over the "hill"
route to Clatskanio, a distunce of five
.mil one-half miles. Part of this
road Is fair and bo mo of it quite
rough, hut If one drives carefully
tlieie is no danger of broken springs
or much personal discomfort. At the
top of tho hill going down to Clats
kanio, drlvo slow und sound your
horn often, ns tho rond is very nar
row und quite steep. There are only
a few places ut which autos could
puss each other. Also bo sure your
brakes uro good, for you will need
them.
Leaving Clatskanio, tho road for
several miles Is quite good, though
much Work is being done nnd con
siderable looso rock mukes it hard
on tires. Tho road In tho vicinity of
Westporl In rough, so it Ib necessary
to drlvfl rdow to escapo the hard
bumps, llugby hill 1 good, there
being only ono rough pluco and thnt
is after you have reached the sum
mit. From ltughy to Astoria, a dis
tance of 25 miles, there are only a
dozen rough spots, nnd by going ovor
those in daylight ono makes it enslly.
Whero Improvements havo been nindo
mil souii) soft spots nro still to be
found, brush und plank have been
used which nuikcs the going a little
'hot re.-.
The road from Astoria to Seaside
Is paved most of the way, and at n
speed of 20 miles per hour you can
muko this lust leg of tho trip In one
hour. Ho careful not to exceed the
25 niilus per hour, for two speed
oops nro constantly on putrol.
Tnklng it nil in ull, tho trip Is not
a bud ono nnd by driving carofully
.".nd leisurely ono should make It in
About six nnd ono-hnlf hours to Se'
r.ldo, which is about 100 miles from
St. Helens. The ronds are well
marked nnd one should buvo uo trou
i.i in finding the right way. On the
way buck, coming out of Clatskanio,
tuko tho "hill" road insteud of going
i.ir Mnvi.ni- in this way you will
escapo much corduroy roud, but com
ing up tho hilt ho sure to took out
for cars, and also be sure of your
gasollno supply and brnkos, for if
anything happens It would be very
uiiconifortablo on this steep grade,
which Is roat long and rough.
.The actual running tlmo of the
Mist car to Sonsldo was about seven
hours, and coming hock, when the
road was drier and In better shape,
about six hours. Nothing occurred
lo mar the pleasure of tho trip ex
cept a fow blowouts, which the auto
man naturally expects on a rough
road.
Though much work is being done,

ST. HELENS SCHOOLS
OPEN SEPTEMBER 4
RESUME OF PAST YEAR
Full Corps ,f Fxpei ienceil Teachers
ami a HueceNHful Term Assured.
Uy solicitation. Prof. L. L. Baker
has kindly furnished the Mist with
li3 following Interesting facts relut-
ig to tho St. Helens schools and an
outline of the work for the coming
school year:
St. Helens schools opened last year
en August 31, and a very successful
year's work was accomplished by
both teachers and pupils.
Our high school enrollment in
creased over 90 per cent, having in
Uendance pupils from Mayger,
Goblo, Oeer Island, Yankton and
Warren.
Sewing and domestic science were
offered to girls of alt grades in the
igh school, and sewing to the girls
of the seventh and eighth grades.
whllo manual training was offered
to the boys of the high school and
o the boys of the seventh and the
eighth grades. Sewing was also
taught to the girls in the fifth to
eighth grades, inclusive, of tho Mc-
Hride school at West St. Helens.
Tho Boys'. Glee Club, directed by
Mr. McCoy, did very credible work
for the first year, appearing be'ro're
the public on several occasions.
Our high school entered into ath
letic contests during the year with
Ridgefleld, Warren, Scappoose, Deer
Island, Rainier, Clatskanio and
Franklin high school of Portland.
Our boys gained a reputation for
clean sportsmanship. Wa sent a
representative to the high school
meet at the stato university who won
gold medal and a bronze medal,
securing for us the sixth place in
tho meet, which was doing exceed-
ngly well for one representative.
A four-year teachers' training class
wus put into our high school for the
first time last year, having a mem
bership of twelve, eleven graduated
from this department. Many took
up the training class work, for the
review which it offered in the com
mon English branches.
Music, which was taught by a
special teacher year before last, was
curried on by each teacher in her
owu room, without tho music super
visor, nnd some very good work was
done.
The total enrollment for the entire
school last year was 475, showing an
Increase over the previous year of
about 10 per cent, which is con
idercd a good, healthful growth.
St. Helens schools will open this
year September 4, with a full corps
of experienced teachers.
L. L. Baker will be the city super
ntendent and will havo general
supervision of all the schools and of
ill departments of the school work
nd will nlso teach the training class
eubjects.
Frederick Knight will bo principal
of the "high school, and will teach
3cienco and history.
Lloyd Schisler will teach mathe
matics and will coach athletics.
Miss Duns will again have lang
uages and literature.
Miss Lillle M. Leith will have the
lovonth and eighth grades; Mr. Mc
Coy, tho sixth; Mrs. Wilson, the
fifth: Miss Slotboom, the fourth; Mrs.
Lnke, the third; Miss Philip, the sec
ond; Miss Perry, tho first grade.
Charles Lake wilt be the princi
pal of the McBrlde BChool, with Miss
Weist and Miss Matthews, assistants.
Our aim is to raise tho efficiency
of alt departments of the school dur
ing the coming year. In the grades
we shall pay special attontion to oral
English and arithmetic With this
ond in view, a supplement' to the
state course has been prepared, giv
ing more minute directions and many
valuable aids for a special campaign
In the teaching of these two Import
ant subjects. This does not mean
that other subjects are to be neglect
ed or that more time will be taken
up by these subjects, but that we
are going to teach them in a more
practical way and we hope to secure
better results than we have obtained
heretofore.
In the high school, we expect to
do more in the line of literary work
SEATTLE OFFICIALS
VISIT ST. HELENS
Impressed by C'ity'H Commercial
Importance.
Nelson Troyer and wife, Hen W.
Johnson, wife and daughters Edith
and Jane, Howard Josslin and wifu,
his daughter Ruth and Miss Ethel
Shefe, all of Seattle, wore St. Helens
visitors Wednesday night. The party
were on their way to Seattle. Leav
ing Seattle last Friday, they motored
over the Pacific Highway, crossed
the Columbia at Goblo and made Sea
side the same night. Returning, they
went via the Forest Grovo route,
visited some places in the Willa
mette valley, took a trip up the Col
umbia Highway and then started for
home. Mr. Troyer is manager of tho
Seattle-Astoria Iron Works. Mr.
Johnson Is superintendent of th9
manual training department of tho
Seattle public schools, and Mr.' Joss
lin is electrical engineer for the city
of Seattle, a position he has held for
the past fourteen years. The party
spent some time in St. Helens and
made favorable comments upon the
activity of the city, but could hot
understand why a city tho size Mid
importance of St. Helens should not
havo some paved streets.
IMPROVING SYSTEM
The Pacific Telephono & Telegraph
Company is rebuilding its toll lino
the entire distance from Portland to
Seaside. About every ten miles be
tween St. Helens and Seaside are
gangs of men setting poles and
stringing wires. Each gang is com
fortably housed in ' portablo camps,
cither on heavy wagons or trucks so
auto trucks can haul them to the
next station. The Mist is informed
that the improvements under way
will cost in the neighborhood of
$250,000, and it is hoped to have
the work completed this fall. The
line follows the highway most of tho
distance, tho only exceptions being
whero It crosses several high hills,
making the distance shorter than If
it followed the many curves of tho
highway.
SAVED FROM DROWNING
Mrs. Gus Lope had a narrow es
cape from drowning down at Colum
bia beach Wednesday evening. A
large crowd was In bathing and Mrs.
Lope ventured too far out and was
soon struggling in deep water. She
went under the socond time when
Joe Mosey went out and rescued her.
Sinco the water has receded, the
"jump-off" is pretty close to shore
and thoso who cannot swim should
not venture out very far. The water
s probably thirty feet deep at tho
jump-off."'
NEW AUDITORIUM
The new auditorium building on
tho fair grounds is weir under way
and will bo completed in plenty of
lime. It Is now under roof and tho
work is progressing rapidly. Other
Improvements are also being made.
and debating. Last year two liter
ary societies wero organized, ono for
the girls ujider the direction of Miss
Duns, and one for the boys, directed
by Mr. Sten and Mr. Ostrander.
These two societies made a good
start in tho work, which will be con
tinued this year. The plan is to have
each society do debate and literary
work and to give one public enter
tainment some- time during the
school year.
Mr. Schisler comes to us highly
recommended ns a coach in all lines
of athletics and we Bhall endeavor
to have more and better sports than
we had last year.
A modern heating and ventilating
plant is being installed in the high
school building which will Insure
healthful conditions at all times.
Tho McBrido school is being thor
oughly cleaned and will be put In
good condition. Tho school grounds
will be improved soon by the removal
'of brush and small trees.
We believe that an education con
sists of such a preparation of tho
child in his moral, physical and in
tellectual capacities as will enable
him by the exercise of their use to
be the greatest benefit to society.
