HID MOV
ON NORTH HUH
May be Beginning of Impor
tant Developments
*!, The railroad move in the North
Fork section of the Clearwater tim
ber district mav mean the begin
ning of the work for the south loop
of the Milwaukee road, announced
at the time the company first indi
cated its intention to build its line
to the Pacific coast. This is the
suggestion of people of the North
Fork section who are familiar with
the nature of the. location now be
ing made by the Milwaukee engi
. neers and who do not believe in the
logic of hauling logs uphill when
they will roll down-hill to better
mill sites and where climatic condi
tions are more favorable for curing
the product.
The Milwaukee several months
ago announced its plans for con
structing an extension from Elk
River into the Clearwater timber
district. Two engineering parties
have been engaged in the location
work for the past four months and
the permanent location of the line
from Elk River to the mouth of Elk
creek Is now being made. This
line will be about 17 miles in length
and will reach the North Fork at a
point about eight miles above Ah
sahka. Another crew is working
down the North Fork from Big
Island, a point about 25 miles above
the mouth of Elk creek. This lat
ter crew has been engaged in pre
liminary location work in the Reeds
creek section and has made investi
gations at Big Island, where a dam
to provide facilities for storing logs
will be constructed.
The Milwaukee railroad has pur
chased considerable land at Big
Island and has options on other
property. Among the purchases is
the claim of Robert Lamont, while
it is known options have been se
cured on the holdings of Mrs
Blevins.
/fmong the residents of the North
Fork country are experienced lum
bermen who have worked in impor
tant capacities with the largest
lumbering companies of Minnesota,
Wisconsin and Michigan and they
scout the idea that the Clearwater
timber will be hauled up the heavy
grade from the mouth of Elk creek
to the high ridge upon which the
Elk River mills are constructed
They would rather believe that the
real plans are to locate a mill on
the River, either at Big Island or
some point on the main Clearwater
and haul the logs from Elk River
district to this new mill. They
support this idea with the reports
given out as semi-authentic, that the
Elk River milling site has long
^''<*en unsatisfactory because of un
/Arable weather conditions for
curing the lumber and the abscence
of a market for the cheap products.
What the North Fork people
really believe is that the line will
be constructed from Elk River to
the mouth of Elk creek and from
Big Island to the mouth of Elk
creek, but they also believe the
line will be brought down the
North Fork to the main Clearwater
river and it will be constructed up
the North Fork to a connection
with the main line in Montana. It
is a proposition of dealing with a
tonnage to extend beyond a hun
dred years and they point to the
map and shake their heads when it
is suggested the actual construction
now contemplated is to haul this
Clearwater timber up the Elk creek
grade, down into the St. Joe canyon
and over the northern Bitter Roots,
a circle of several days' circumfer
ence from the standpoint of the
average daily mileage for a load of
freight, when a very small invest
Woody for Commissioner
For six years John L. Woody has
been one of Latah County's most
efficient Commissioners. He has
served his district and his county
with a zeal bordering on enthusi
asm. To the county's business he
attends with the same promptness
and efficiency that he gives to his
own. A prosperous and successful
farmer in all the name implies, he
thoroughly understands the needs
of his fellows. Through his entire
official career no one can say that
the county's business has suffered
through the inattention or neglect
of Mr. Woody. The above every
voter in his district clearly under
stands.
There is a matter, however that
is not generally understood for Mr.
Woody is a modest man and does
not boast about his achievements.
There is in existence a state organi
zation of County Commissioners
that meets at the Capital City once
each year. It is not generally
known that Mr. Woody is the presi
dent of this organization, a signal
honor conferred on him by his as
sociates. He also fills this honored
station with credit to himself and
honor to his county.
He is strictly an up-to date Coun
ty Commissioner. His honesty, his
integrity, are and always have
been above suspicion. The voters
of this district should not only re
elect Mr. Woody but should make
his election unanimous. Latah
county today stands in the front
rank among the counties of the
state and it must be kept there.
This is clearly a business proposi
tion that confronts every voter and
he must see to it that his ballot con
tains the name of John L. Woody.
Good Bunch of Beans
Sam Callison brought a bunch of
beans to the Gazette, which were
raised by Ben Callison on American
ridge. The single stalk contained
eighty-one pods and if they all ma
ture the stalk will produce nearly
500 beans. There are many fields
this season that give promise of
producing from 1000 to 1500 pounds
, _ . , tl ,
to the acre. There is probably j
more clear money in beans than
, , .... , . ,
were planted. If the land is prop
any other crop that can le raised
here. Ben Callison raised forty j
acres of beans this year, along
with his other farm work, without I
hiring any help, but he did most of j
his cultivating before the beans j
erly handled, one man can take
care of a big field of beans and do
it easily and the crop is mostly
profit.
Bucking Cow
Burl Emmett has a shorthorn
cow that has furnished a lot of
amusement on Little Bear ridge.
She can buck harder than any
broncho in this part of the country ^
and it is said that up-to-date, Wade
Candler is the only one who has
ridden her "straight up." Wade
has. ridden bucking horses all his !
life but he says that the old cow
put him next to some new ideas in
bucking that he never saw before. !
It is likely that the cow will be on |
exhibition at the fair this fall and
a prize will be given for anyone
who can ride her without "pulling
leather.

Home Made Silage Cutter
C. C, Blackburn has a little
blacksmith shop on his ranch in
Brady Gulch and if there is any
thing in the way of iron work that
he can't do it is something that he
has't tried yet. He keeps the shop
for his own convenience and makes
about everything in the way of
tools and farm implements that hè
uses on his place. He made nearly
all of the tools in his shop even to
his drill bits. Some time ago he
made a grist milt for grinding corn
meal and it worked fine. He even
cut out the mill stones from solid
pieces of granite which he found
at the mouth of Cedar Creek.
His last piece of home made ma
chinery is a silage cutter which he
made from some pinions and old
irons taken from an old style Mc
Cormick reaper. The cutter is to
be run by a horse power and Mr.
Blackburn says it will cut corn as
fast as one man can feed it. He
will begin filling his silo the latter
part of this month.
Postoffice Robbers Caught
Spokane, Wash., Aug. 23.—Frank
, Hays, 28 ; James Donovan, 48, and
j p q
Bradley, 30, have been ar
rested by the police and will he
charged with blowing the United
States postoffice safe at Marcus,
Wash., and stealing $300.
The three men are believed by
the local postoffice inspectors to
, have robbed the safe of postoffice
station No 9 at the Blodgett Mer _
j
I
j
j
cantile company in Spokane, the
postoffice safes at Deary, Idaho, at
Kendrick, Idaho, and several others
from which a total of nearly
$5,000 was stolen in the last six
months.
Hays and Donovan have been
identified by Foreman Hammond of
the National Iron works as the two
men who visited the works about
six months ago and had an imple
^ ment to remove knobs and locks of
safes made. Bradley has admitted
1° tbe police that he pawned a gold
watch, which Police Clerk C. O.
! identified as one stolen from
Deary when the postoffice was rob
in bed.

Roberts Improves Livery
_
Harvey Roberts ig puttjng in a
number of substantial improve .
jmentsinhis livery barn. He has
had a concrete floor put in the
room where his rigs are washed and
a concrete watering trough built.
F. A. Wallace did the work. He
is also getting all new buggies and
some good horses. He has a new
six cylinder car and will have auto
service along with his livery and
feed stables. There is no question
but that he will make a success of
the business.. •
Clem's Machine Burned
George Clem's separator was
completely destroyed by a smut ex
plosion and fire Wednesday after
noon, while threshing on Bob Cain's
place. The explosion threw Dad
Hall, who was standing on top of
the machine, about two feet into
the air. He was considerably
bruised and one arm and his face
quite badly burned.
The separator was equipped with
fire extinguishers and a hose, but
almost instantly after the explosion
took place, the machine was on fire
from one end to the other and the
fire was so intense that the crew
could do nothing to stop it. The
straw stack was burned but the
grain was saved. Mr. Clem pur- ;
chased a second hand separator,
formerly owned by Chris Maier. j
The cloud of smut which hangs
, , . , , , .
around a machine while threshing i
, , ,, f I
smutty grain, looks like black i
smoke from a fire. Some of the j
neighbors saw the fire from a dis
tance but thonght it was only the
smut cloud hanging over the ma
chine.
Qumtin,
Miss Constance Van
who is given to the free use of ad
jectives, received calls last week
from five young men, each of whom
is "just the dearest boy in all the
world," has "simply died" from
the heat four times, has been "tick
led to pieces" six times by movie
comedians, has been "driven crazy"
eleven times by telephone pests,
and has been "frozen just stiff"
five times by the cool evening
breeze while out riding in the car.
All of which made up rather a
strenuous week for a delicate young
lady.— K. C. Star
"My least boy, Bearcat, is 4
years old, and the fightin'est little
cuss!" triumphantly stated Mr.
Gap Johnson of Rumpus Ridge,
Ark. "He never gets whipped, no
matter how big the odds are against '
him. Why, tuther day he started a
holocaust with some of the rest of
the children, and a smattering of
six or eight of 'em piled onto him
and rid him all over the place like
a blind horse, a-beating of him in
tones of thunder as they went. But,
sir, they never whipped him! He
just simply riddled out from be
neath the pile and retired in good
order to a previously prepared po
sition under the house and begun
to tell 'em who they was and whur
thev could go to." K. C. Star.

Park's threshing machine on Pot
latch ridge caught fire from a smut
explosion Tuesday, but the fire was
extinguished and the machine run
; ning again in about fifteen minutes.
' A dry powder fire extinguisher was
used. '
Peterson for Probate Judge
L. G. Peterson is Kendrick's can
didate for Probate Judge. This
office is one that comes very close
to the people who are in dire dis
tress because the hand of affliction
has been laid heavily upon them.
Death has entered the family and
has taken its chief. Provision has
been made to have the estate that
has been left behind properly ad
ministered for the benefit of help
less ones, widows and orphans, and
here is where the Probate Judge
comes in. His most important
duties are found in the settlement
of estates of deceased persons.
This is an important trust and
should be given into the hands of
no one who has not stood the test
of the most far reaching honesty.
Mr. Peterson has stood this test
and he appears today before the
voters of the county untainted. As
a rising young lawyer he has never
been connected with shady trans
actions of any kind and is, as he
always has been, an upright Chris
tian gentleman. He is the kind of
a man that the widow or orphan
could implicitly trust at all times
and under all circumstances. Think
of this when you approach the bal
lot box, and remember that, aside
from the moral attitude of this
candidate, he has had a technical
training in the law so that he is
more than well qualified to admin
ister the affairs of the office of Pro
bate Judge. There is no reason
why we, his townsmen, should not
give Mr. Peterson our undivded
support. It seems at this writing
only reasonable to say that
Latah
county's next Probate Judge will
hail from Kendrick.

A resident of Iowa, who tacitly
i ......... . . -
I admits that he has been a patron of
i
j
CaiTy Disease
the mail order houses, has opened
up an entirely new line of thought
in connection with these concerns,
in a communication sent to his
home paper wherein he submits
that the causes for hitherto un
traced diseases may well be charged
ca talog houses who take back
f»°°ds, particularly clothing, dresses
e tc., as being unsatisfactory to the
purchaser, after they have prob
a ^ly been tried on by all sorts and
conditions of people.
De calls attention to the fact
that nowhere in the catalogs of the |
mail order houses do they agree to
ship new and unused articles, and '
that from the first page to the last j
no mention is made of any system
of fumigation for the thousands of j
packages sent back to them although
they have been sold to people living
in the most filthy hovels of Mexico,,
or in the "black belt" of the south
and returned for various reasons,
The letter to the editor of the paper
was called forth by the epidemic of
infantile paralysis, several cases
having been reported in Iowa for
which physicians could not account,
' This is a new angle to the mail
order menace, but it can very read
ily be seen where the Iowa man nas
good ground for his contention,
when it is considered that most au
thorities now concede that a major
ity of the diseases with which hu
manity is called upon to cope are
caused by germs of various kinds,
No mail order customer has any
assurance that he or she will get
new, fresh goods when
from the catalog, and the articles
they buy may well have been prev
j iously tried on or examined by per
sons afflicted with some dread com
municable disease.-West Trade.

LEWISTON WILL
NOTHOLD FAIR
Will Send Representatives to
Other Points
Decision has been reached by the
board of directors of the Lewiston
Clarkston Fair Association to can
cel the plans for the 1916 annual
fair. Lewiston held a Fourth of
July celebration this year and will
give the big annual stock show
this winter so that instead of hav
ing the fall fair, they will join
with the outside communities and
help make their fall festivals a
success.
The Tribune says that Lewiston
plans to organize larger delegations
than ever before sent out of Lewis
ton to attend the fairs to be
held at Moscow, Cottonwood, Oro
fino, Kendrick and other points.
They intend to provide such stunts
that the fairs will know that Lewis
ton is with them and they will be
liberal in their patronage of every
thing that the fairs have to offer.
The Lewiston-Clarkston fair has
been a big annual event for the
central Idaho and eastern Washing
ton region for 15 years and has
been recognized as one ot the most
successful fair organizations in the
northwest. It is explained that the
men who have been identified with
the Lewiston-Clarkston fair man
agement during these many years
would willingly give all possible
assistance to the fair organizations
at outside points.
- The Dream Farmer
We met a friend the other day,
and he was mad. He had been
running a grocery store until this
spring. Now he is running a farm,
Life on the farm doesn't look as
rosy to him as it once did. He
sun-blistered, chigger-bitten and
discontented. He says he finds it
hard to sell enuf milk to buy cow
with vain imaginings,
is the only independent man, they
feed, and his hens insist on eating
regularly and most of the time
they forget to lay eggs. He be
lieves he will get a job on the road.
This sort of disillusionment is com
mon enuf. All the towns and cities
are full of dream farmers—back-to
the-landers— who feed themselves
The farmer
say. It does not cost him anything
to live. Nothing at all. Every
dollar he takes in is just so much
clear profit. Things just grow in
to money while he sleeps. It is the
rosiest of all dreams. Fortunately
for them and the rest of us, most
of the city dream farmers stay
where they are. They never wake
up, because they never move to the
country and experience the stern
reality. The fact is, of course,
that it takes a farmer to farm suc
cessfully. The barber and the
bookkeeper and the ribbon clerk
will do much better as a rule if
they confine their agricultural work
to the imagination. An inexper
ienced and uncapitalized urbanite
can come to the farm and be happy
and prosperous. He has been
known to do it. But it isn't the
rule. Farming is a man's sized job
and the man who believes it to be
a rosy dream is apt to have a sad
awakening.—Farm Life.
