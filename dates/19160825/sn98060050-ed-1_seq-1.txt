THE COUNTY TICKET.
Contests for state se.iatur, assistant
juugo ana state s attorney will servo
to enliven interest in the forthcoming
jinmary election m this county. For
tli'j two senatorial nominations thcro
aro four aspirants Ilcrmoa E. Eddy
of Urattleboro, Frank A. UeWitt of
Nowfane, John II. Ware of Towns
head and Matt L. IMvolI of Hocking
ham. 'three candidates Fred B. l'ier
of Urattleboro, E. L. Hastings of
rownsliend and K. P. Adams of Murl
boro are after the two .iudiicshms.
while for tho Humiliation of state's at'
tomey there are three seekers Wil
lia:n R. Daley of Urattleboro, Osro It
C laytou of Londonderry and Fred B.
Filigree of Rockingham. For judges of
probat" mid sheriff there are onlv as
many candidates as there are nomina
tions to bo made, mid nobody had the
hardihood to file a petition for high
bailiff.
Although the senatorial candidates
are divided equally between tho West
minster nnd Marlboro probate districts
there is no indication that tlio voters
will observe this gcngrnphirnl division
in making their choice. Those who
wish mny vote for Messcrs. Eddy and
DeW'itt notwithstanding tho fact that
both live in the southern end of the
county, or for Messrs. Wnro and Divoll,
both residents of the north end. It
would be hazardous to predict the out
come of tho senatorial primary voto at
this time, although the fact that Mr.
Eddy is a resident of Brattleboro
would seo:n to make him the snrcst of
the four to find a place on tho ticket.
Of the three candidates for judgeship
nominations Messrs. l'ier aad Hastings
iiave the slight advantage of now hold
ing these offices, but Mr. Adams is n
man who has an excellent record as a
legislator and tho many friends he has
made in the rourho of his public ser
vice mako him a candidate to be reck
oned with.
In tho opinion of The Phoenix Mr.
Daley is the only one of the tltrec can
didates for state's nttorney whoso le
gal experience is sufficient to warrant
his nomination. Tho office is not ono
which should be passed around or used
ns a "crutch." It ought to be given
to tho candidate who is best able to
moot its requirements. ,
THE SENATORIAL SITUATION.
In spite of the fact Hint the date of
the pri.nary is littb more than two
weeks off the senatorial situation has
not yet shaped itself in such a way
that a definite prediction of tho result
can ba mado with safety. This is partly
because there is no extreme enthusiasm
for nay ono of tlio threo candidates, and
partly liecaus.' at the very lowest esti
mate twenty or thirty times as many
people will have u direct voice in nom
inating a senator this year as was the
cube under the old method.
However, if Tho Phoenix wore to
venture a prediction based on the sen
timent at this end of tlio statu it would
be to tlio effect that the choice lies be
tween Fletcher and Gates. That Sen
ator Pago's chances of renomiuatiou
have boon given a severe blow by tho
exposure of his bunking methods there
can be no shadow of a doubt. Even
his strongest friends are finding it dif
ficult to make a satisfactory explana
tion of his conduct, and Senator Pago
himself has yet to produce a convinc
ing nnswer to the ehnrges made ngainst
him by the stntn bank commissioner.
Whatever he may think of tho motive
that inspired tlio publication of those,
charges the nvorago voter is compelled
to admit that ,tho charges themselves
nro serious enough to make extremely
doubtful the wisdom of keeping Sena
tor Pago longer in public office, Con
fiddic in Ids integrity lias received a
decided jar.
Long before the exposure of Senn
tor Page's bunking methods Tlio Phoo
nix expressed tho conviction that the
best interests of Vermont demniided his
retirement. Needless to say, that enn
virtinn is stronger today th'au ever lie
foro.
As between Mr. Fletcher find Govern
or Gates The I'hoeaix lionostlv believes
tlio former is better qualified to rep
resent Vermont in tlio United States
senate. If mere popularity were the
chief consideration Governor Gntes
would bo as good as nominnted al
ready, but on tlio score of ability Mr.
Fletcher has a decided advantage, and
it is nn ailvnntauo that ought to grow
ns the matter is pvon careful thought.
The St. .lohnsbiiry Cnledonian per
forms n public service in pointing out
that there are two things with the now
primary law which should bo remem
bered when the voter goes into the
booth on September 12. First, the fuct
ho has signed n man's petition does
not bind him to vote for that num.
lie could not sign n second petition
but if there have been developments
since ho signed a man's petition that
make him want to vote for another
man lie is at liberty to do so. Second
ho can vote in only one political col
umu. Ho cannot vote for one or moro
of the Democratic candidates and then
voto the rest of the ticket Republican
or vice versa. He is not obliged to voto
lor nil the candidates, in cither party
but all ho votes for must be in tho
samo party or his vote will be thrown
out as defective. So don't attempt to
split'your ticket when you vote if you
want your vote to count.
DAMAGE BY STORM
Another Generator Burned Out at
Power Plant in Vernon
Loss is Sovcral Thousand Dollars J.
T. Wright's Tobacco Flold in Vornon
Riddled by Hailstones.
In the thunder storm Wednesday af
ternoon a bolt of lightning burned out
auother geuerator in the Connecticut
River Power Co. 'a plant in Vernon, tho
becond in 10 days. The damauo will
bu several thousand dollars. A gen
erator was burned out in tlio storm of
Aug. 8, causing similar damage. There
aie six generators left at that station.
Other stations owned by tho company
will toko care of whatever part of the
load is necessary until tho repairs can
bo made. It will
fo complete repairs on the Generator
burned out Aug. H nnd about six weeks
to rebuild the one damaged Wednesday.
vruinariiy tne iigiitmag arresters di
minish the current enough to prevent
serious damage, but the last two storms
were ot excessive severity.
The storm Wednesday was much more
severe in Vernon than in Brattleboro,
in lact it was one ot the hardest in
years in that town. Aside from the
damage at the power plant the heavi
est loss was sustained at John T.
Wright's tobacco Held. Lariro hail
stones riddled his three-nere field. He
carried ifliOO insuranco on the tobacco
through 11. h. Taylor i: Sou's agency
in this town, and the loss will be to
tal. Others in Vernon sustained small
losses. The roads in South Vernon
were washed in several places.
The Xew Enulaud Telephone com
pany's lines wero again put out of
commission north of the Dunklee farm
in South Vernon. Tho trunk lines
were laid Hat near the Dunklee place
and a force of men, includine: Wire
Chief H. C. Shaw, worked there until
nearly morning. An immense tree about
a mile this side of South Vernon was
struck by liglituinj; and took tiro so
that the llames shot up through the :nid-
nil- ui me hit. me unemeu an
pronched it they supposed it to bo a
corner of a buildiiiL' burniiiL'. It was
still horning at 2 o'clock next nioruiui:
ami men who went there after daylight
said that it had burned Hat.
The correspondent of this papor in
uinsuaio writes;
mis town was visited bv a succes
sion of scvero thunder showers Wednes
day from nbout 2..'10 in the afternoon
until 8 in tho evening and tho light
mug was the most alarming of the
suinin-r, although so far ns known at
this writing did no dnmngo except to
bum out several electric wire connec
tions. The rninfall was exceedingly
havy nnd reached cloud burst appear
ance about C.'IO o'clock, and the But
ters nnd sewers were totally unable to
enrrv off the Hood of water. The high'
ways in the village, particularly on the
hill, wero badly damaged, the worst
washout occurring near F. O. Pnck
aril's and on Church hill, where the
going was nind! impnssablo for vehi
cles. Sidewalks nnd lawns in many
jilnces wore covered with gravel nnd
stones ami Jlnm street nt one time re

LITIGANTS BURY THE HATCHET,
Sign Noticos of Settlement of Dlsagroo
inonts, Which Means Discontinuance
of Litigation.
Considerable litigation was brought
to an end Monday by the filing of untie"
es of the settlement and discontinuance
of ensos of AVarren G. Doolittlo against
John M, Monro and of Moore against
Doolittlo, Fred Thomas and George
Mnndell.
The first of these eases was to have
been heard by jury Monday morning in
the municipal court and the second was
a count eoiut case. Both nuxe over a dis
pute between tho two principals regard
ing the expiration of n lease of a farm
owned by Mr. Dnnlittle in Nowfnne. A
jury henrd the rase of Doolittlo against
Monro in June and disagreed. It was
to have been tried again Monday.
The notices wero signed by Mr.
Moore and by O. B. Hughes, attorney
for Mr. Doolittlo.

cents n mile nnd full pav of $1 n dnv.
The committee on mileage and deben
tures recommended that the mileago
allowance be 20 cents and tho
house adopted the recommendation. The.
senate, however, purposes to cut th"
mileage allowunce to 10 cents n mile.
There were only 20 absentees when
the house convened nnd of these four
wero ill and three dead. All of the
Windham county delegation wero pre
