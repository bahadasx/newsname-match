FAIR COMMITTEES
HELD A MEETING
Apportioned Money to Vari
ous Committees—Premium
List Be keady Next Week
No Grafting Be Permitted.
The fair committees held an
other meeting Tuesday afternoon
and arranged for the apportion
ment of the fair funds to the
various committees and for the
completion of the premium list,
which will be ready for publica
tion next week. The finance com
mittee reported that $1,500 had
been secured to defray the ex
pense of holding the fair and it
was decided to provide free feed
and care for all of the animals en
tered for exhibition. While the
prizes will not be large it is hoped
that the interest developed be
tween the residents of the com
munity will result in much friend
ly rivalry and will make the win
ning of the prizes of more real
value to the exhibitor than any
monetary consideration attached
to the prizes.
The committees also decided to
include a sheep department
among the exhibits and Fred
Simon, Barney Luchtefeld and J.
E. Gentry were named to have
charge of this department.
The domestic science and fine
arts department was placed un
der direction of Mrs. Poyneer,
Mrs. Nettie Lange and Mrs.
Giezentanner, while the building
and decorating committee, which
was overlooked in the list fifst
published, is composed of W. B.
Hussman, E. L. Parker, Fsed
Lange, John Funke and A. H..
Nau.
The committees went on record
as favoring home people having
charge of the concessions as far
as possible and grafters and
grafting in any nature will not be
tolerated.
The premium list will be in
fine shape for publication next
week and after that date the
residents of this locality can be
gin preparing their stuff for ex
hibition.
Will Sell Paige Cars
A. L. Larson, of the Foster
Larson Co., was in the city yes
terday from Spokane and placed
pn agency here with the Cotton
wood Hardware Co. for Paige
cars. Mr. Larson will be back
next week with a demonstration
car for the local agency and
within a short time a big ship
ment of the popular Paige cars
will be received here for distri
bution throughout this territory.
The Paige company is putting
out two cars, the Fleetwood 6-38
and the Fairfield 6-46, and in
the territory where the cars
have been sold they bear a
very high reputation. With the
new agency established here
there will undoubtedly be many
Paige cars sold on the prairie
within the next year.
Work is progressing nicely on
the new flour mill building being
erected by the Farmers Union
Warehouse company and the
building is now up and enclosed
and has been given its first coat
of paint this week. The inside
finishing is now under way and
the building will be ready in a
few days to receive machinery.
We are informed the machinery
for the new mill has already been
shipped and is expected to reach
here almost any day, after which
it will be installed at once. It is
the aim to have the new mill
ready for operation by October
first unless something unforeseen
happens to prevent
Bought A Big Ranch
Dr. H. J. Smith, of this place
closed a deal late last week for
the purchase of the John McFee
farm of 440 acres three miles
east of Melrose, the purchase
price running well up toward
$15,000. The deal was made
through A. V. Ball, real estate
dealer of Peck, and is considered
as one of the best buys of the
season. Dr. Smith says the
place is well improved, having a
large new barn and silo, good
fences, out buildings, abundant
water and pasture, and the farm
land is nearly level and very
clean. The place is an ideal
stock farm and the former owner
was in the habit of turning off a
couple of carloads of beef cattle
and from a hundred to a hundred
and fifty head of fat hogs each
year. A new grade which is
being built up the canyon from
Peck^will placelthe farm within
four miles of that place and on an
easy grade and will add materi
ally to its value.
Dr. Smith is elated over his
purchase and says it comes near
er to being exactly what he has
wanted in the farm line than any
place he has heretofore seen. He
has not yet decided whether or
not he will go! onto the place
himself or turn it over to a
brother to operate, but will de
cide within the next few weeks.
Notice to Farmers
The attention of the farmers of
this'section is respectfully called
to the coming fall fair to be held
in Cottonwood and the fact that
it will be necessary at this time
to save samples of grain in the
sheaf for exhibits at the fair. A.
O. Martin, who has charge of
the agricultural exhibits, desires
that a large number of grain
samples be taken in order to
make the exhibit as large as pos
sible and, with the fine grain that
is being grown on the prairie this
year, some exceptionally fine
samples of grain should be shown.
Therefore, save the samples now
while the grain is still in the
field o r shock. After the
thresher gets there is is too late.
Will Hold Fall Fair
Cottonwood, the progressive
little city at the edge of the
Camas prairie, is making ar
rangements for a big agricul
tural fair to be held in October.
This is a step in the direction
every live community should go.
It is a self evident fact that
Cottonwood is alive to her own
best interests.—Genesee News.
Joseph Hill and mother are in
town today from near Nezpere.

Mr. Kube Is Recovering
D. H. Kube, who was severely
hurt a few weeks ago when his
team ran away while raking
hay, has sufficiently recovered as
to be able to return to his ranch
home northwest of this city. Mr.
Kube's neck was dislocated and
a very delicate operation was
necessary to adjust it. The oper
ation was performed by Dr.
Gritman of Moscow, assisted by
Drs. Slusser and Rains r of this
city. Mr. Çube was able to be
about town for a couple of days
before leaving foi^l home, and
while his neck was somewhat
stiff, was causing him no un
easiness, and he and his many
friends are very grateful that his
recovery had been brought about
so rapidly and completely.—

They All Like Montana
Mrs. Lora- B. Hale returned
Wednesday evening from a visit
of a couple of months with her
daughter in Montana and says
she saw practically all of the for
mer Cottonwood people who have
taken homes in the "Treasure
State" within the past few years
and that all of them are well
satisfied with the country and
are getting along nicely, while
several are on the high road to
fortune. She says the crops are
fine up there this year and ap
pear to be fully as good as here,
while a price of $1.27 was being
offered there for wheat when she
left. Most of the farmers have
in a nice acreage of grain and ex
pect to come out on top with the
good crop and fine prices this
year. Mrs. Hale says many have
done a great deal of work in im
proving their places since going
there and she did not meet any
who were dissatisfied with the
country, although some had not
yet gotten used to the occasional
severe electrical storms.
High Praise For Parker
"The democrats of north Idaho
have not been very exacting this
year in claiming places on the
state ticket, but there is a candi
date in the primaries who will be
supported by all who know him.
He is E. L. Parker of Cotton
wood and his friends have filed
his nomination for the position of
lieutenant governor. Mr. Parker
is one of the best-known and
best-liked men of all the central
north Idaho country. He was a
pioneer resident of Nez Perce
county, when this country em
braced within its boundaries
Clearwater and Lewis, and dur
ing a period served as county
commissioner with marked
ability. Later h e moved t o
Cottonwood in Idaho couuty and
has represented that county in
the legislature. He is a success
ful business man, thoroughly
wide-awake, conscientious and
true to all trusts. He would
make a lieutenant governor of
whom the state could be proud.
He will get the full democratic
vote of the party in this section
of the state in the primary on
September 5 and if he is nomi
nated he will get in the general
election many hundreds of votes
from the republicans also."
The above article in the Lewis
Tribune soumis very good to
Cottonwood people and we can
personally vouch for every state
ment made by the Tribune about
Mr. Parker's ability and fine
personal qualifications. When a
candidate for this office two years
ago he ran far ahead of his ticket
and will do the same this year.
In fact, with anything like nor
mal conditions, he stands a fine
chance of election next Novem
ber.
Go Overland To Wyoming
M. S. Hendrickson and Otto
Aichlmayr left Wednesday morn
ing in the latter's Ford car for
southwestern Wyoming on a two
weeks' business trip and outing.
They went down the Salmon
river to Boise and then to Poca
tello and into Wyoming. Mrs.
Hendrickson was recently award
ed the government patent to a
160-acre farm near Big Piney,
Wyoming, and it is for the pur
pose of looking over the place
and determining its value that
Mr. Hendrickson is making the
trip at this time. After looking
at the land he may decide to sell
it and invest the money in land
on Camas prairie.
They went well equipped with
guns, fishing tackle, tent and
bedding and will camp out along
the route and enjoy the trip to
the fullest extent.
Felix Martzen was a Winona
visitor yesterday.
