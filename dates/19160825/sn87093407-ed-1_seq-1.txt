Hslsn Oould'a Friend
ONE CENT N|.»M MiMMm,
Johnny Clancy Is Arrested After String
er's Men Use Guns to Halt Terrified
Guests—3 Resorts Are Raided in
Wee Small Hours.
Sweeping King county in the biggest raid in its history, sher
iff's deputies, directed by Under Sheriff John Stringer, early Fri
day emptied three notorious roadhouses of their drunken women
and men roisterers, hustled some to the county jail, seized large
stocks of assorted liquor and at a late hour were continuing their
search for big caches of intoxicants said to be buried about the
shores of Lake Washington.
Wild orgies were in progress in each roadhouse, it is said,
when the deputies swarmed in and ordered everybody, guests and
hosts alike, to throw up their hands while a search was made for
| liquor.
About 80 people were found, nearly half of whom were wom
en and almost all of whom are said to have been unmistakably
under the influence of liquor.
The places raided were Johnny Clancy's roadhouse at The Mea
dows, Tom Shuter's houseboat at Kenmore and Bill Mullen's
houseboat at Juanita.
At Clancy's the raiders surprised about 50 people, some seated
at tables drinking, others in the ball room doing dances that would
not pass muster at the board of censorship.
There was a panic. Men and women dashed for doors and
windows but were blocked by deputies.
All about the notorious old roadhouse was unmistakeable evi
dence that liquor had been dispensed and consumed in large quan
tities, it is said. For the first time in history, Johnny
liquor "plant" was discovered.
Prosecutor Lundin said Friday he considered the raid the best
stroke of law enforcement the sheriff's office has been responsible
for in many months.
"We will have a chemical analy

HER LOVE SPURNED,
WHITESLAVE TURNS
AGAINST BETRAYER
NEW YORK. Aug. 25— In
the same little wicker satchel
in which she once carried her
books snd lunch to the Irving
high school, Csroline Kaufman,
pretty white slave victim, today
carried to the office of Assist
ant District Attorney Jsmes
Smith letters, telegrams and
pictures which will serve ss
evidence agslnst Gustave Ku
gelman, slleged white slsve
ringleader.
With tears In her eyes, she
told of her betrayal.
Gustave Kugelman was ar
raigned in the court of general
section*, and In default of $10.-
000 ball was locked In the
Tombs.
Included In the documents which
Miss Kaufman turned over to
Smith were letter* to Kugelman
from prominent actresses on the
legitimate stage and In the motion
plrture business Kugelman insists
that the letter* were genuine.
Miss Kaufman is 22, and an ex
ceptionally attractive girl of me
dtum height, with coal black eyes
and hair, and a fine physique.
Altho reluctant to tell her story.
Miss Kaufman commented at the
opening that even now she did
not see the "wrong of this life."
Attorney Smith explained to her
that her testimony would result In
the prosecution of Kugelman.
Miss Kaufman then told how she
met Kugelman thru a girl friend
The love-making that followed did
not pass the bounds of propriety
for more than a year. Miss Kauf
man said
She became deeply In love with
Kugelman and believed his story
that he would marry her as soon
as the rich fnther he told her about
died
in November. 1014. Miss Kauf
man began to live with Kugelman
as hN wife, and then she learned
that there was nothing to the "rich
father" story, and that Kugelman
had been married at Atlanta.
Kugelman begged forgiveness
and added that he ncedet money.
She gave him the $10 ahe made
each week as stenographer, but he
needed more. She refused at first
to consider hi* method of getting
more money, but finally consented.
Gave Up Her Money
He Instructed her to walk on cer
tain streets and to use certain ho
tels She said she did as *he was
ordered, and was never molested
by the police
Miss Kaufman told how she re-

earned $10 a week as a stenogra
pher and a* a slave averaged ISO a
week.
She retained enough for herself
to buy food and clothing and turn
ed over the rest to Kugelman. Sha
continued this for two years with
out a protest, until she learned
that Kugelman thl* week married a
woman in Ilrooklyn. Then *he con
