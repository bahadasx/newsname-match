sponsiouity ana is masing an
active campaign and will use all
honorable means for election. He
has spent his entire life in the dis

OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
1916-17 Term to Begin Monday,
September 4
A Loss to the Community
From Missouri Dry.
Mr. T. M. Elliott of Laclede
wrote us a few days since telling
of the death of Mrs, Elliott, which
occurred some days previous. By
reason of the fact that we nn
fortunately mislaid the letter telling
of Mrs. Elliott's death we cannot
give the exact date. Mr. and Mrs
Elliott have been potent forces in
the fight, for prohibition and the
general good at Laclede for many
years, and Mrs Elliott's death will
certainly be a loss to that com
munity. To our friend Elliott we
extend our most sincere sympathies
and trust that our Heavenly Father
may sustain him in this hour of
trial.
In less than two weeks the La-
clede public schools will be open.
It would.be very much out of ordei
to think that Laclede will have
It A
anyining out a successful vear
again. With but a single exeep
tion, the faculty isthe same as it
was last year. This includes Miss
Barber, Miss Kent, Miss (Joins and
Miss Heath in the grades; and Mr
.jrooiisnanK ana iwiss xnppeer in
the high school. As the third
teacher in the high school, Miss
Hunter will succeeded Miss Walker.
The course of study will be more
extensive than that of last vear.
Besides the regular course, which
was given last, German, Cicero
and Bookkeeping will be added. It
will be possible therefore for a
student to select his or her work
from a large curriculum.
To back up a strong course of
study like this it is necessarv to
have plenty of facilities. The ap
paratus is in excellent shape al-
readjp-and the library is in a good
workable condition. But to make
it still stronger, a campaign for
gettiug books will be started soon
after school opens.
The Laclede high school is a
first class accredited school, both
by the university ot Missouri and
the state department of education.
So as far as ranking is concerned
can go no farther, for it has
reached the highest pinuaele in
that way.
If you were to consider the
strong points of a school, namely,
the faculty, the course of study,
the equipment, and the rating or
tanding, do you think yon could
beat Laclede as a place to send
our boy or girl? The school is
growing stronger every year, then
why not let your boy or girl grow
stronger with it.
