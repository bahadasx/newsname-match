THE FEDERAL
FARM LOAN ACT
ORGANIZATION OF BANKS.
The temporary management of
the Federal land banks ia to be in
the hands of five directors appoint
ed by the Federal Farm Loan
Board. , As soon however, as the
subscriptions from the loan associ
ations total $100,000 regular direc
tors are to be appointed as follows:
Three district directors, resident in
the district, shall be appointed by
the Federal Farm. Loan Board to
represent the public interest, and
six local directors, resident in the
district, shall be elected by the
farm loan associations who must
, be stockholders in the bank. The
Federal Farm Loan Board shall
designate one of its appointees to
act as chairmau. The act requires
that at least one of the three dis
trict directors shall be experienced
in farming and actually engaged at
the time of his appointment in
farming operations within the dis
tiict. Any compensation paid to
the directors must be approved by
the Federal Farm Loan Board.
OFEICERS OF LOAN ASSOCIATIONS
Each loan association must have
a board of directors and a secre
tary-treasurer. The directors shall
serve without pay. The secretary
treasurer shall receive such com
pensation as may be determined by
the board of directors. The asso
ciation must appoint an appraisal
committee for the purpose of valu
iug lands offered as security for
loans, No member of such com-
mittee shall have any interest in
the property upon which he passes.
FUNDS FOR CtJKBENT EXPENSES.
To provide funds for current ex
penses, the loan association may
retain as a commission from each
interest payment not to exceed one-
eighth of 1 per cent semiannually
upon the unpaid principal of the
loan. This commission is to be
deducted from the dividends paya
ble to- such farm loan association
by the Federal land bank. If the
commissions are not adequate, and
an association does not wish to as
Bttss members for current expenses
it may borrow at 6 per cent from
the Federal land bank to an amount
not to exceed in the aggregate one
fourth of its bank stock.
RESERVES AND DIVIDENDS.
The law requires both the land
banks and the farm loan associa
tions to make provision for cer
tain reserves before they can pay
any dividends.
AGENTS AND LAND. BANKS.
In sections where loan condi
tions do not make the formation
of associations practicable, the
Farm Loan Board may authorize
the Federal land bank to make
loans through agents approved by
the board. These agents are to be
bunks trust companies,, mortgage
companies or savings institutions,
chartered by the State. They may
receive as compensation the actual
expense involved in transacting the
lo-in and in addition thereto a sum
not to exceed one-half of 1 per cent
pr annum on the unpaid principal
( the loans made through them.
"When' the Farm Loan Board de
rides that a .locality is adequately
8rved by farm loan associations,
no further loaus are to be made
t li rough agents. . -
JOINT STOCK LAND BANKS."
In addition to the system of 12
Federal land banks and the nation,
al farm loan associations of bor
2KMver8).the act permits th estab
lishment of joint-stock land banks
and authorizes them to carry on
tlje business of lending directly to
borrowers on farm-mortgage secur-
i-ty and issuing farm loan bonds
These banks must have a capital of
not less than $250,000. They are
under the supervision of the Fed
eral Farm Loan Board, but the
Government does not lend them
any financial assistance.
The joint-stock land bank is free
from many of the conditions im
posed on the Federal land banks.
Subject to the 50 and 20 per cent
value limitation and the limitation
as to territory, the" joint-stock land
bank may lend more than $10,000
to a single individual, and it is not
restricted to making loans for the
purposes specified in the case of
the Federal land bank.
The joint-stock bank, like the
Federal land banks, can not charge
an interest rate on farm mortgages
in excess of 6 per cent, nor shall
such interest rate exceed by more
than 1 per cent the rate of interest
paid by the bank upon its last is
sue of banks. A joint-stock bank
is limited in its bond issue to 15
times its capital and surplus.
Among the restrictions placed
on these banks under the act are
(1) that their mortgages must pro
vide for an amortization system of
repayment such as is prescribed in
the case of loans through the Fed
eral land banks, and (2) that they
shall in no case demand or receive
under any form or pretense any
commission or charge not specifi
cally authorized by the act and ap
proved by the Farm Loan Board.
The bonds of the joint-stock land
banks are exempted from taxation.
Their capital stock, however, is
not exempted.
GENERAL PROVISIONS.
The law, through the Farm Loan
Board, provides the necessary ma
chinery for frequent examinations
of the banks and the associations,
for the proper cancellation of mort
gages and for the safe custody of
mortgages offered as security for
bonds. When any mortgage of
fered as security for bonds is with
drawn, the bank is required to
replace the security with other
mortgages or with other satisfac
tory collateral.
Heavy penalties of fine or im.
prisonment, or both, are imposed
for violation of the act, malfeasance
in office, fraud, embezzlement, de
falcation or other illegal practices.

COUNTY NEWS
IN A NUTSHELL
COWELL CHAPEL.
Mr. Editor, if you will allow me
space I. will write a few lines to
The Chronicle from Cowell Chapel
It is hardly necessary to say that
we are having plenty of rain, but
we are pleased to advise that crops
are good and everything looks like
peace and plenty for another year.
Health is fairly good, for which we
feel extremely thankful
We have just closed a grea
meeting in which the pastor was
assisted by the Lord himself. No
man could do the preaching he did
without the Lord's guidance, con
sequently we not only received the
beauties of the promise but learned
the terrors of the law. Each ser
vice was well attended. The meet
ing resulted in several conversions
and the church was greatly revived
The chapel maintains a good
Sunday school, or rather we should
say it maintains us. It is growing
all the while, both numerically and
spiritually, and it is helping us to
grow in grace and knowledge.
Brother G. B. Greer preached to
us Sunday, as Brother Stubblefield
had to go to Mount Carmel to be
gin a meeting, which is in progress
this week. Brother Greer preach
ed a great sermon to a goodly num
ber of hearers.
We have in our community an
organization known as the Bural
Development Association, which
bears about the same relation to
the community that the Sunday
school does to the church. The
Sunday school reaches and helps
everybody in the church socially
and spiritually, and the Rural De
velopment Association helps the
people in a material way.
One of the first benefits derived
from this organization was an
aroused interest in our literary
school. We found that the school
house (20x30 feet) was too small,
and realizing that we had fulfilled
the Scriptural injunction to "mul
tiply and replenish the earth" to
the extent that a troop of 8C to a
100 bright-eyed boys and girls
must be educated,-we decided to
investigate the consolidation plan.
It was the conclusion that if it is
a good plan to take two schools in
a community with 50 or 60 pupils
and consolidate them in a good,
well - ventilated house with two
teachers, why not Cowell Chapel,
an extraordinary community with
a scholastic population of over 80
pupils and all residing near enough
to attend school here without the
usual conveyance why not build
along the plans of a consolidated
school building and supply them
with two teachers?
Having arrived at a conclusion,
the decision was prompt. We set
out at once to carry the plan into
execution. To be brief, we planned
the work and now we are working
out the plan, and we will take a
delight in showing anyone inter
ested that we are doing things, and
God bless you, in the face of all
obstacles and the limited time, we
intend to grit our teeth and hustle
until we' have , provided the way
whereby our children will have
better opportunities than their
parents. S'- "
If God is for us, who can be
against us? We have linked our
destiny with God's will; we have
faith in him and believe He will
guide us to success. "Will we
succeed?" some one asks. "Yes,
if yon faint not." That's right,
and we haven't fainted, but the
building is going up, and if not
providentially hindered school wil
open in the new building on the
nrst Monday in September, a
which time if we have only one
teacher there will be no let up un
til we procure the second one.
Some may ask how we will do it.
Just like, we are going to get the
house go down in "our jeans" and
dig up the required amount.
We should have explained in
the outset that we bought two
acres of land upon which to build
the house and for a campus. A
part of it will be made into a flow
er garden and some of it for dem
onstration work. Permit me to
say in conclusion that so for the
good women have not been a factor
in this new undertaking. With
the women of the community as a
reserve force, we have no doubt o
the final result.

"Actually, it uas gotten to be a

trouble began pulling me down and
I finally got so I could not eat any-'
thing at all scarcely, and I had to
diet myself continually. I had to
avoid sweets of all kinds and al
ways alter eating I would suffer
for hours.
"I was also very nervous and
dizzy and was easily tired. I final
ly got so weak I could not walk any
distance without resting. Mv kid
neys must have been affected also,.
for I had severe pains in my sides
and back.
"My sister, Mrs. Minnie HalL
came to see me one day and she '
ooked so well I asked her what
she had been taking. She told m
Tanlac, and I made up my mind
right then and there to give it a
trial.
"Acting on her advice, I bought '
a bottle and have been taking it
ieHUJuriy since, ur course i ex
pected it to help me, but if anyone
had told me that there was a medi

helped me like Tanlac I would not
have believed them.
"The medicine seemed to be just
the only thing I needed, for it just
filled me with new life and energy
from the very first dose. In only
a few days my appetite returned
and I began to enjoy my meals and
everything seemed to agree with
me and nourish me.
'I am no longer nervous and
