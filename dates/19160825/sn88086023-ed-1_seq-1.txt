TM.
Miss Muriel Saling uf Pendleton
pieen of the 1U Portland Ros
Festival and of Ihe Columbia High
way, has been asked by Astoria to
rule over the annual Regatta there
next month, and she has also ben
chosen as queen o' the 1916 Kourd
L'p. Thus in all probability she will
have the unprecedented distinction
uf having presided over the three
largest municipal festivals in the
state this year.
The action of the Astoria pe-.le
came as a big surprise to Pendleton,
inasmuch as no intimation that they
had been considering the election ot
Miss Saling had been received until
the Commercial association late yes
terday afternoon received a telegram
raging the association and the Round
l'p directors to secure Miss Salmi's
consent.
The Round-Up directors Immedi
ately named her as queen of the 1911
Round-Up, an action they had been
considering before, and both crowns
were tendered Queen Muriel at the
same time However, it was not un
til late lb s momlng lhat she was In
duced to accept the proferred dou
ble honor
President Brock of tne Commercial
association at once sent the follow
ing telegram to P. C. Harley, chair
man of the Regatta committee. "Miss
Muriel Saling. Queen of the IS. 6
Ronnd-t'p. will accept the honor ol
Queen of your Regatta if elected
The Round-l'p and citizens of Pen
dleton will give you every support
possible. Pendleton sincerely appre
ciates the honor."

was hoped thereby to strengthen tile
bonds between the inland empire and
Astoria. Also it is suggested thnt

It was only in recognition of the

that Miss Saling finally yielded to

cial association and ttOUnd-Up rep
resentatives. Since she stirrendere 1
tile throne of Rosaria. she has been
perfectly contented with private life
and would shun the limelight that
must come with the assumption ot
mure queenly honors.
The election of Miss Baling as
queen of the Round-Cp yvas only a
natural consequence of her Other re
gals honors and the choice meets with
the unanimous approval of the peo
ple of Pendleton. Once before Miss
Sal ng was chosen as queen of the

bellowed upon her in 1911.
