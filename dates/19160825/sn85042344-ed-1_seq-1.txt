Mr. Hughes referred to "claims of
all candidates that they want effici
ency of government."
"1 should not expect you would
think what I say worthy of special
atenlion." he said, "were it not that
1 have devoted four of the best years
of my life, regardless of politics, in
maintaining those ideals In the Km
plre state."
Tho nominee referred to the ad

"If our friends on the other side
had had a proper sense of the obli

Mr. Collins is one of Alton's most

SPECTACULAR COLLISION
Photo by Clarence Jack.
The most spectacular railroad wreck in the history of Tulsa occurred
yesterday morning at 10 o'clock when two engines crashed Into one an
other on tho main line Midland Valley railroad at Twenty-first and Huston,
near Maple ISidge. Persons living near the scene of the accident were eye
witnesses to the collision. A switoh engine was returning from the Texas
refinery und a freight train, consisting of 18 cars loaded with crushed
rook was on Its way south. The accident occurred on a long curve. A
clump of weeds prevented the engineers from seeing each other until It
was too lato to prevent the collision. Iloth crews Jumped a minute before
the onpines came together. No one was hurt. The engine on the freight
train was demolished and the first three cars, loaded with ballast, were
piled on top of one another. The switch engine had been thrown in re
verso by tho engineer and following the Impact the mogul was thrown
back full three hundred feet. 1-arge pieces of tho drlvewheols were scat
tered along; tho track and the engine was almost a total wreck- A long sec
tion of tho track waa torn and twisted. A wrecking crew was rushed to
the city from Muskogee and some time this morning will have placed the
main line in shape for traffic. The above picture, made by clarence Jack

phase ol the situation of some Impor
tance was laid before the cnljloronco
by the special i cinmittce.
