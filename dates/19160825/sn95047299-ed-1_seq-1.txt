'S
TO ERECT BUI
On Reid Street Owned by
Club To Be Discussed
Today.
Mrs. E. M. Dunsford, president of
the Palatka Woman's Club has call
ed a meeting of the club at the Put
nam House parlors at 4 o'clock this
afternoon for the purpose of discus
sing plans for the proposed new club
house.
That sounds good.
The Palatka Woman's Club owns a
fine lot on Reid street between Third
and Fourth streets, directly in rear
of the new building being erected on
Lemon street by Leo Jacobson. The
club also has $1,000 in the treasury,
so we are given to understand. Plans
for a building will be studied at the
meeting this afternoon and it is like
ly that some definite steps will be tak
en toward an early construction of the
building.
As one lady, a prominent club
worker stated: "We want to erect a
building to cost somewhere between
$4,000 and $5,000. We have $1,000 in
the treasury now. Our idea was to
erect a club house that could be rent
ed for church and other public en
tertainments and which could servo as
a club house. There is no place in
the city at present suited for church
or society socials. We would also
have a small hall for entertainments.
There is some opposition to tho plan,
but I believe a majority of our club
women favor the building. Other ci
ties and towns have them and are do
ing well. Crescent City club women
have had a club house for many years
and it is a social center. Last win
ter this club also built what is possi
bly the prettiest little theaer in Flori
da at a cost of $6,000 and are con
ducting a moving picture theater in
it. It is the loading organized effort
for social improvement in the town
and on its ample grounds the club
has tennis courts and other forms of
amusement. The club there also is
a potent factor in municipal work,
having contributed much toward road
and sidewalk building; in fact the
Crescant City women have been lead
ers in every piece of town improve
ment attempted in the orange city
in the past 20 years or more. They
had to borrow money to put up the
theater, or part of it. The Palatka
club has enough to start on and I
believe can borrow the balance needed
at a favorable rate of interest. I
think we should begin the work im
mediately, and will hope to assist in
briniring' about action looking to that
end."
Palatka-Hastings Road.
Eugene Masters and party motored
over to Palatka Thursday, and when
interviewed this morning about th3
trip, told about the road work which
is now in progress between East Pa
latka and the St. Johns county line
near Hastings. The work of putting
down the vitrified paving brick is now
in full swing. The width of the brick
surfacing is eighteen feet from the
east end of the St. Johns river bridge
into East Palatka. From East Pa
latka to the St. Johns county line and
1 to Federal Point, the brick surtacing
is nine feet. At first is was thought
i it would be necessary to arrange a
' detour road covering all this section,
i tlm pfinstviietinn work was
commenced, it was found entirely
feasible to have the automobile traf
fic use one side of the road-bed, where
there is ample room and where the
traveling is not at all disagreeable.
The work is progressing so rapidly
that it will not be many months be
fore this complete stretch will be
thrown open to public travel. A no

REPUBLICANS NAME
FULL STATE TICKET
Hon. Geo. E. Gay of Palatka
Nominated for State
Treasurer.
Palatka is a favorite meeting place
for Florida republicans, judging from
the fact that the last two State con-;
ventions have been held in this ciy,
and that the State Executive Commit
tee of that party, composed of some
of he State's most substantial citi
zens, met here last Friday and com
pleted the State ticket.
The News of last week published
the names of some of the more promi
nent committeemen present, of which
Hon. Henry S. Chubb of Dado coun
ty is chairman.
Hon. George W. Allen of Key West,
republican gubernatorial candidate
was not present, but sent a letter con
taining his regrets and urging the
members of the committee to com
plete the ticket, which at the conven
tion last spring was only partly nom
inated. The ticket as completed last Fri
day is as follows:
Presidential electors: Morgan E.
Jones, Miami; Fred Cubberly, Dade
City; John Stoker, Quincy; B. W.
Foxworthy, Fort Myers; P. C. Stick
r.ey, Jacksonville.
United States Senator: W. R.
O'Neal, Orlando.
Members of Congress: First dis
trict, Henry W. Bishop, Eustis; sec
ond district, William M. Goble, Ocala;
third district, Peter H. Miller, DeFu
niak Springs; fourth district, D. T.
Gerow, Jacksonville.
Governor: George W. Allen, Key
West.
Justice of the Supreme Court: John
M. Cheney, Orlando; Edford Bly,
Jacksonville.

Attorney General: M. B. MacFar
lane, Tampa.
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion: Dr. George W. Holmes, Sharp.
Railroad Commissioner: Alexan
der J. Good, Tallahassee.
A number of ringing speeches
were made during the session of the
committee, all predicting republican
success in the nation next Novem
ber, in which event many of
the gentlemen present will be able to
boar up under State defeat, as the
federal offices will go largely to the
members of this committee by ap
nnintmont of the nreseident.
I A republican politician in Florida
is not without hope in the world, ana
therefore of all men most miserable.
He's been a feeder at the federal
trough for many years, with only an
occasional crowding out to make
room for democrats.
DR. ill RETIRES
iMM onunm m
mum ouiiuul u
Dr. D. C. Main of Welaka who was
recently named by the voters of
School District No. 1, as member of
the County School Board to take his
seat next January, is not going to
be able to take the place as witness
the following letter from the doctor
to The News received on Wednesday:
Welaka, Aug. 23, 1916.
My Dear Mr. Russell:
An opportunity, the kind that comes
only once to a fellow, has come to me
in the shape of a chance to practice
medicine and at the same time do
post graduate study for the next five
years or so.
1 must therefore ask the voters of
the First School Board District to
elect a man to fill the vacancy I leave,
at the same time thanking them
most sincerely for the confidence that
caused them to place me in nomina
tion for the most responsible posi
tion the voters have to offer any man.
I do not intend to desert Florida,
for I love my boyhood home, but I
shall put my 'time in studying along
the lines of the specialty work I hav j
been doing for the last few years.
Yours very truly,
D. C. MAIN.
Dr. Main also states that Dr. C. M.
Mitchell of Dalton, Ga., will succeed
him in the practice of medicine at
Welaka, that he is a gentleman who
comes well recommended iy nis pro
fessional brethren in Georgia, and
whom Dr. Main trusts will gain the
same or a greater degree of conn -deuce
among the people in all lines
of uplift work than has fallen to his
own lot. . , , , t
Not only the people of Welaka, but
the medical profession of Putnam
countv and Florida will lose by the
going' of Dr. Main, who has attained
to statewide prominence through his
special medical research.

ATT'Y GENERAL 1ST
That to Vote in General
Election There Must be
Re-Registration.
Primary and General Election Two
Separate Matters Holds State Regis
tration Law Unconstitutional.
In a communication to the secre
tary of state in reply to an inquiry
from him, Attorney General T. F.
West expresses doubt of the validity
of that portion of the primary elec
tion law which provides that the reg
istration for primary election shall be
sufficient registration for general
election and he advises that the safe
course for a voter is to see to it that
he is duly registered on the general
election registration books.
Attorney's Letter.
The letter which explains the mat
ter follows:
Honorable H. Clay Crawford, sec
retary of state, capitol.
"Dear Sir: I am in receipt of your
communication containing the follow
ing inquiry:
" 'The question as to what the leg
islature intended should be done by
the supervisors of registration in
making the registration for the pri
mary election a substitute for regis
tration for the general election has
been repeatedly asked this depart
ment. " 'The particular statute requiring
a construction is the second and
fourth paragraphs of section 9, of
chapter G4GU, Laws of Florida as
amended by section 1, chapter 6874,
which reads as follows:
" 'That all persons who have here
tofore registered or who may here
after register under the provisions of
chapter 64C9 of the Laws of Florida,
acts, of 1913, in election precincts
which are not located wholly or in
part within a city of more than twen
ty thousand population shall be deem
ed duly registered for all general pri
mary elections and all general and
special elections so long as they con
tinue to reside in the election pre
cinct in which they so registered and
their names shall be carried upon the
registration books as electors duly
registered for such elections.
" 'That in all election precincts lo
cated wholly or in part within a city
of !more than twenty thousand popu
lation biennial registration shall be
i requested, as provided by the provis
ions ot chapter b4hy, ot the Laws ol
Florida, acts of 1913, and all persons
so registering shall be deemed duly
registered electors for the general
election next following the primary
for which thev registered, and for any
special election held subsequent to the
general primary for which they reg
istered and prior to the next follow
ing eeneral primary, and their names
shall be carried on the registration
books as duly registered electors for,
such elections.
" 'The problem confronting the Su
pervisors of registration, as they seem
to see it, is (1) whether they should
substitute the primary registration
books for the general election or
transcribe the names from the pri
mary books to the general election
books, and (2) if the latter construc
tion prevail, whether under such con
struction the electors who have reg
istered for the primary, but whose
names are not registered in the gen
eral election books, should be required
to make a separate and independent
registration for the general election;
in other words, would the transcrip
tion from the primary books to the
eeneral election books be a sufficient
legistration for the general election?
" 'I would be pleased for you to
tdve me your opinion as to a proper
construction of the statute above
i uoted."
Two Sets of Books.
"Under existing statutes there are
two systems of registration as a pre
requisite to voting in this state, one
for the registration of electors in pri
mary elections, the other for the reg
istration of electors in general elec
tions, and two separate and independ
ent sets of registration books are kept
in each county for this purpose.
"If the provisions of the statute
puoted in your letter are valid, I
think the registration officer of the
i ounty would be warranted in trans
cribing the names of electors appear
ing upon the registration books for
primary elections upon the registra
tion books for general elections, hav
ing in mind always, of course, that
ach elector should be registered in
the precinct of his residence.
"There is, however, in my opinion,
some doubt of the constitutional val
idity of that provision of the statute
making the registration of an elector
under this statute for primary elec
tions sufficient registration of such
lector for general elections.
"This doubt arises because of this
situation: by section lfi, of article III,
of the constitution it is provided that:
"Each law enacted in the legisla
ture shall embrace but one subject
and matter properly connected there
with, which subject shall be briefly
expressed in the title, etc.
"The title to the primary, election
'aw as originally passed in 1913 is as
follows:
"An act to provide for and regu
late primary elections.
"And the title to the amendatory
act of 1913 is:
"An act to amend sections 9, 10, 11,
12, 40. 44, 52, 55 and 63, and to re
peal sections 64 and 65, of chapter
6469, of the Laws of Florida, entitled
KNOTT GAINED EIGHT
VOTESJHECOUNT
Of Georgetown Precinct (No.
2) at Court House on
Monday.
Last' Monday morning in obedience
of the peremptory writ issuing out
of the Supreme Court, the inspectors
and clerk of the recent primary elec
tion in Georgetown precinct (No. M.
appeared at the court house for the
purpose of recounting the ballots of
that precinct.
I here was no claim of fraud in this
precinct, and there was none. But
it didn t take an expert to see that
in tabulating the second choice votes
the work had been done improperly
and in such manner as to make it im
possible for the canvassing board to
known from what tickets these second
choice votes came or to whom they
were to be credited.
The first choice vote in this pre
cinct on governor was: Catts 4:
Farris 7; Hudson 1; Knott 5; Wood
8. This made a total of 25 votes.
There were 11 second choice votes,
which in the tally sheets were placed
in tho dead line. On the recount it
was shown that these second choice
votes should be credited as follows:
Catts 0; Farris 2; Hudson 1; Knott
8; Wood 0. The eight votes for Mr.
Knott were from the tickets of Far
ris and Wood, two from the former
and six from the latter.
This recount of the Georgetown
precinct gives Mr. Knott a total gain
of 20 in the county.
Death of Mrs. Bryan.
Mrs. Levina Bryan, the aged moth
er of Mrs. H. S. Cummings and Mrs.
W. A. Goethe of Rodman, passed away
on Monday. A native of Georgia,
Mrs. Bryan has lived with her daugh
ters at Rodman for some fifteen
years. She was 84 years of age,
and beside her daughters is survived
by four sons, B. F. Bryan of Way
cross.Ga., T. B. Bryan of Rodman, A.
J. Bryan of Chicago and R. L. Bryan
of Florida.
The funeral occurred at' the Rod
man Methodist church on Tuesday af
ternoon, and was conducted by Rev.
S. Grady, pastor of the Palatka Meth
odist church. The interment was in
Oak Hill cemetery. Mooney & Da
vis had charge of the funeral arrange
ments. an act to provide for and regulata
primary elections, approved June 3,
1913.
Party Legislation.
"The quoted section of the consti
tution requires that the subject of
the act shall be briefly expressed in
the title. The subject of the statutes
referred to is 'primary elections.'
There is no reference in the title of
either of the acts to 'general elec
tions.' A 'primary election' is a
substitute for a convention and is
simply a method of selecting party
candidates.
"A 'general election' is an election
of officers. They are not synono
mous terms nor is one, comprehended
in the other. They are employed
for distinct purposes and different
results are accomplished by them.
"By the title the legislature ex
pressly limited the scope of this leg
islation to providing for and regulat
ing 'primary elections.' There is no
reference in the title of either of the
acts to the 'subject' of 'general elec
tions' and it is not clear that the
qualification f electors for general
elections can be regarded as 'matter
properly connected1 with the 'subject
as to render unnecessary a reference
to it in the title of the statute. In
this situation there is, I think, suffi
cient doubt of the validity of that pro
vision of these statutes making the
registration for primary elections a
registration also for general elections
to have attention called to it and to
suggest to the registraion officers
that all electors who have heretofore
registered in the registration books
for general elections do so while the
' books are open, in order that no ques
! tion may arise as to the regularity
: and validity of their registration.
"Of course I do not say that this
I provision of the statute is invited. 1
only undertake to demonstrate that it
may be so held by the courts, and I
do say that there is room for doubt
of its' validity and that since this is
true the safe course for an elector is
to see to it that he is dujy registered
upon the registration books for gen
eral elections so that if it should be
held that tho registration for primary
elections is not a sufficient regis
j tration for general elections, he would
not he denied the right to vote in the
! general election.
: "This is advisable for another rea
; son, namely: If, after the general elec
I tion is held, the question of whether
I or not electors who had registered on
the registration books for primary
! elections but had not registered on
the registration books for general
! elections were qualified to vote in the
; general election, was raised and it
should be held that such registration
was not sufficient, great uncertainty
i and dissatisfaction would probably
! follow.
I "For this reason I am suggesting
j that all electors register just as if
the registration books for primary
i elections were not in existence. Of
I course if any elector has heretofore
I registered in the registration books
! for general elections, it will not be
necessary to do so strain.
"Respectfully,
"T. F. WEST,
"Attorney General."
A LETTER FROM STURKIE
Former Committeeman
States Position on His
Published Letters.
Dade City, Aug. 21, 1916.
Editor Palatka News:
Dear Sir: I want the Democrats
of this State to know that the at
tack made by Mr. Knott upon me is
false, libelous and without founda
tion in fact. I am not for old Catts
and never will be; I have never
spoken civilly to him or to any of
his henchmen. Under no consider
ation could I ever lend my aid to one
who has conducted a campaign of
hate and ignorance, as Catts has
dene; then to have one I have trust
ed as I have Mr. Knott, to come out
and accuse me of such an unholy al
lir.nce with an itinerant old hypo
crite, aside from being a breach of
professional etiquette of the broad
est nature, is a very painful personal
affront, and more than I can under
stand, i
I have supported Mr. Knott in sea
son and out of season, and have pub
licly defended his action in institu
ting this contest and his whole course
from the commencement of the suits
and expect to continue to support
him until he is declared the nominee
which I think he will be, regardless
of this unwarranted and libelous at
tack lie has made upon me. In do
ing so, I am defending the Demo
cratic party and not Mr. Knott indi
vidually, and would defend any one
else under the same circumstances.
There is no reason why Mr. Knott
should get so desperate as to assail
a true friend, as he has; it certainly
will not gain him any friends, but on
the contrary, he will lose many
friends by this unwarranted attack.
I have faith in the integrity of
cur courts and am going to abide by
their decision.
I am forced to submit to the fact
that my correspondence with Messrs.
Knott and Adams was tainted with
over-enthusiasm in Mr. Knott's be
half, but I was writing to them un
reservedly, as I would to a friend
and client, and did not have the
slightest idea that either of these
gentlemen would violate a confidence,
but I find that I have been mistaken.
I have no personal knowledge of
any votes anywhere being tampered
with. The ballot boxes in this county
arc intact.
Mr. Knott says that I did not re
ply to Mr. Adams' communication
wherein he requested me to secure
the mandamus. This is absolutely
false. Immediately upon receipt of
the communication I went before
Judge Reaves and secured an alter
native writ and had the same served
upon the county judge and supervi
sor of Registration, thus securing a
copy of the tally sheets; these co
pies being made by tho county judge
any my stenographer, Mr. A. G.
Knight, I not being present during
the making of the same.
I want the Democrats to under
stand that I am not lined up with
Catts and have never entered into
any kind of an agreement or frame
up with him or any of his henchmen,
but, on the contrary, have fought the
principles that he advocates and will
continue to fight these principles un
til tho Democratic party is purged
of such men as Catts and his hench
men. Please give this matter all the pub-
, licity possible and make such com
i ment on it as you shall see fit, as I
desire to be put in my true light be-
fore the TRUE DEMOCRATS, and
. want the Cattites to know that I do
! not favor them in one single particu
lar. ' I will thank you to mail me a copy
. of the issue containing this letter.
! Very respectfully,
R. B. STURKIE.
OARO OF TRADE
ELECTS OFFICERS
For Ensuing Year Con
siderabla Interest
Taken.
The annual election for officers of
the Palatka board of trade took place
at the board room on Monday even
ing with a considerable show of in
terest. Notable among those voting
and considered a sign that presaged
only good for the future of the
board's work, was the number of the
younger business men of the city
present, taking an interest.
The following gentlemen were cho
sen officers: President, II. F. Leeks;
first vice president. M. B. Cochrane;
second vice president, R. L. Earnest;
governors, J. V. Walton, H. P. Ner
wich and L. A. Smith. Among those
who failed of election the majority
wore also young men.
There was some activity on tho
j part of certain members of the board
j to get a list of officers who were fa
! vorable to the election of Mr. T. R.
! Iliggins as secretary. Mr. Higgins
is the associate editor of the Morn
! ing Post, and the plan was for him
to divide his time between employers,
' giving his days to the work of the
; board and his nights to the Post.
On this plan he can work for the
board much cheaper than the aver
age secretary could afford to do. Mr.
Higgins is a very excellent gentle
man and well qualified for the work
of the secretaryship. His selection
seems assured.
