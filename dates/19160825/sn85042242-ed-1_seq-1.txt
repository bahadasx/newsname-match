Berlin
via London, Aug. 24.—Most
of the buildings here are decked with
flags in celebration of the return of
the merchant submarine Deutschland.
The newspapers give the exploit of.
Captain Koenig the prominent place
in their editorial comments, and dis­
cuss the possibility of the empire get­
ting certain much needed materials
through merchant submarines. Cap­
tain Koenig and his crew have been
feted as heroes.
The press gives liberal praise to the
fair and neutral conduct of the Amer­
ican government.
The Cologne Gazette say»:
"The American government was
thoroughly and correctly neutral. The
American fleet saw strictly that the
American 'boundaries were duly re­
spected by the English as well as the
French. Increased precautions were
taken after an English cruiser had
surreptitiously entered Chesapeake
bay at night."
Captain. Koenig personally.express­
ed great satisfaction at the treatment
accorded him by the American gov­
ernment.
Receives Congratulations.

Count von Reventlow, in the Deuts-j
che Tages Zeltung, is almost alone in
taking a pessimistic view of the en­
tire. affair. He calls attention to the
fact that. overestimating the value of
the merchant submarine is detriment-j
al to the. German interests. The gen­
eral comment, however, is confined to!
a keen appreciation of the daring dis­
played in building and navigating the'
submarine. I
Captain Koenig and his crew are'
due at Bremen Friday, and will be
given a reception to be attpnded 'by

Sheepherder Johnson,
prietor of Werner Hotel, Meets
Death in Auto Accident
FACTS IN CASE
ARE RATHER HAZY
Werner, .D„ Apg. J«&hn*
son of Wernefi Wtt« known as
"Sheep-herder" Johnson, was almost
instantly killed late Wednesday night
when the Ford car which hp was driv­
ing turned turtle on the road just out
from the village of Werner. Johnson
left Werner about 6 o'clock, stating
that he was going for a ride and
would not return for some time. At
just what time the accident occurred
and the cause for his machine turning
turtle, resulting in his death, is un­
known.
Johnson was well known in Werner
and vicinity and was proprietor of the
Werner hotel. He was about 52
years of age. He came to the village
several years ago and purchased the
hotel in this village and has main­
tained the place ever since. He was
a sheep herder in Montana before tak­
ing up the hotel business in this lo­
cality and it was in this way that he
received his name of "Sheep-herder"
Johnson.
Johnson's actons during the past
few weeks had been of a queer na­
ture. He was constantly having trou­
bleat his place of business and of late
imbibed rather freely of the amber
fluid. It is believed by many who
were well acquainted with him that
he was somewhat out of his mind.
As far as can be learned the de­
ceased has' Ao relatives and arrange­
ments will be made at once for ourlal

HIGH TARIFF
Ogden, Utah, Aug. 24.—Charles E.
Hughes today addressed an audience
here on what he termed the necessity
of national preparation for commer­
cial competition with Europe after the
war.
The nominee repeated his declara­
tion that this could be done only under
a protective tariff. He reiterated his
statements that he would do all he
could, if elected, to prevent abuses
under a protective tariff. He declar­
ed that the time had come to protect
American business and achievement,
not to cripple or destroy it.
"Show me any other way by which
legitimate business can succeed," Mr.
Hughes said, "and I am going to do
Imy best to make it succeed."
ONE KILLED WHEN

Ryder, (N.* D., Aug. 24.—A deplor­

fatally and serious injury for two, oc­
curred near Balta during the progress
of a storm. Mrs. A. M. Wright and
her two children had quarters in a
cook car while making hay and herd­
ing cattle in the hills near Balta. The
full impact of the storm struck their
improvised dwelling, tipping it over
and shattering it. Edwin Wright, aged
10, was killed outright. The little girl
had several ribs and one foot fractur­

burned by 'being hurled against the

There was Home impromptu dis­
cussion when the meeting opened yes­
terday relative to the dissatisfaction
expressed by many tax payers at the
policy being followed in handling the
road work. One commissioner ad­
mitted that many complaints had
oeen made to him relative to the •con­
dition of the roads and the fact that
less than 60 miles of road had been
worked this year, as against 250 miles
or more last year, with less equip­
ment.
Public sentiment is strongly in fa­

chase of more expensive equipment,
especially at this late period of the
season.

HEART FAILURE IS
CAUSE OF DEATH
Horace E. Peck, wealthy banker!
of Kenmare, died in his automobile
yesterday at Mohall as he was mak«j
ing the run from the Turtle mountains
to his home. As he left Mohall he __
felt ill and asked his companion to
run the car awhile. The words were
hardly out of his month before he fell
back In tb*-4"»t
Brought to Mohall.
Mr. Peck had been failing for three the last fiscal year, the navy depart
days and was just returning from ajment
mountains when
visit to the Turtle
stricken. He was one of the best]
known bankers of the state. He was
vice president of the State Loan com-1
pany of Kenmare and vice president!
of the First Bank of Mohall. He has
been engaged in business in the north-j
western portion of the state for thej
past fifteen years. I
The deceased had not been feeling
well recently, but yesterday felt im­
proved enough to make the trip from
the Turtle mountains to Kenmare. He
was accompanied by one of the em­
ployes of the Kenmare office.
Son of Minneapolis Capitalist.
Horace Peck was the son of H. N.
Peck, of Minneapolis, one of the
wealthiest men of that city. He is
now at Atlantic City, and the only
sister of the deceased, Miss Alice
Peck, is at Pasadena, Cal. They were
notified and are enroute to Minneapo­
lis, where the funeral will be held.
Word of Mr. Peck's death was re­
ceived in Bismarck last evening by
H. H. Steele, who is a business asso­
ciate of H. 'N. Peck.
Horace Peck had a host of friends
in this state. He was prominently
connected with the development of
the northwestern portion of the state
and one of the best boosters Kenmare
and Ward county had. He took a
prominent part in the promotion of
good roads, being one of the most en­
thusiastic automobilists in the state.
Probably no man in North Dakcyjft
took as many long tours or was as
daring a driver as Horace Peck. Qe
was one of the best marksmen in the
state and took a great interest in the
preservation of game.
Mr. Peck is survived by a widow
and one child. He was 44 years of
age.

Increased So They Will Have Some
Way to Make Up Increase in Payrolls.
Washington, Aug. 24.—Objections, which developed tonight at|
a meeting of railroad presidents and managers, to point to the
tentative plan evolved by the committee of eight presidents consid­
ering was to avoid the threatened general strike, resulted in a
further postponment of final action. The conference adjourned to
meet again tomorrow, and as one president phrased, the situation
is such that "it may be settled in 'twenty minutes or the matte*
may go over to next week."
A statement issued by railroad executives tonight summed it
up this way:
"At the invitation of President Wilson, Messrs. Hale Holden,
Judge R. S. Lovett, and Daniel Willard, went to the White House
at noon, and held a short conference with the president.
"A conference of the railroad executives was held at three
o'clock and a new phase of the situation of some importance was
laid before the conference by the special committee.
"After considerable discussion, without definite action, an ad­
journment. was taken until eleven o'clock tomorrow morning. In
the meantime, the special committee of the presidents will continue
its labors.".

the various conferences.
It developed after tonight's meeting
that objections had been raised" to
the freight rate increase feature on
at least two grounds. It was argued
by some that there can be no as*
surance of a freight rate increase,
but
no one could say what the inter*
state commerce commission might do,
and that some of the nxogt important
shippers of the country have already
made it plain that they are not In
sympathy with any move which may
mean a rate increase. It was point*
ed out also that, although President
Wilson has expressed his belief that
such a rate increase should be grant­
ed if the eight-hour day is given the
employes, no one can tell how the
next election is coming out and there
can be no possibility of an increase
before next (March, or later.
Attention was called, too, to the
fact that .the commission hitherto has
held that it cannot consider wage
standards in dealing with proposed
rate increases, although legislation
by congress might remove that diffi­
culty.
The principal arguments against
the idea of a commission for the pre*
vention or settlement of strikes were
that it would almost -certainly he
fought by labor in congress,. and that
while 'President Wilson might be en*

to do so when it was proposed.
