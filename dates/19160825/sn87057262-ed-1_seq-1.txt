LARAMUfi, Wyo., Aug. 25.—Save
for two days rest at Bridgahampton,
L. I., immediately at the conclusion
of his present campaign. Republican
Nominee Hughes will be continuously
on speaking tours from now until
election time.
According to tentative plans which
have been forwarded to the candi
date, Hughes will set a new record in
campaigning if he is physically fit to
follow out the itineraries which are
now being considered for him.
Today the governor thought he
would be able to go through with
every demand for his presence be
cause he was feeling so fit It Is
the nominee's hope that he will be
known personally to 4 majority of
the voters of the United States.
By the time he has finished his
present trip he estimates that he will
have been seen and beard by ahout
cne million people. After he has com
pleted other campaign tours which,
it is said, will carry him Into prac
tically every section of" the United
States, the republican standard
bearer hopes he will have been per
sonally judged by most of the repub
lican and progressive voters and a
few democrats. As contemplated to
day, the present tour will be con
cluded at the Syracuse state fair on
Grange day September 11. He then
returns direct to Bridgehampton, re
maining there not more than three
days before swinging out again.
Enroute from Kentucky to Maine,
irughes will have a thirty minute
wait between trains at Cincinnati.
Ohio republicans are endeavoring to
arrange for a mass meeting at the
railway station during that time so
that the nominee can make a rear
end of the train speech.

Time.
NEW LONDON. Conn.. Aug. 25.—
Nosing her way through a fog, while
a little tug puffed and snorted along
side, the North German Lloyd liner
Wlllehad swung Into the pier of the
State Ocean Steamship company here
today, adding another chapter to Ger
man defiance of the allied warship
patrol off the Atlantic coast
Customs officials and all New Lon
don believe the coming of the Wllle
had forecasts the early arrival of the
merchant submarine Bremen from the
German port of that name. The
Wlllehad made the trip from Boston
without escort. Coming through the
Cape Cod canal and thence out to
open sea, the liner traversed more
than' fifty miles of her journey through
a zone in which she was subject to
attack or capture, had enemy ships
sighted her. She went out beyond
the three mile limits but was not
molested.
It Is believed the Wlllehad Is to
serve in the same capacity for the
Bremen aB the Neckar in-^Baltimore
did 'for the Deut^chland. The Bre
men's cargo 'will probably be trans
ferred to the Wlllehad which will act
as a "mother ship" for the subma
rine, housing her crew while they are
in port, and also protecting the sub
inerslble from enemy eyes. As the
Deutschland was nestled close to the
Neckar with a protecting tug on the
opposite side, and a wall and a barge
acting as barriers at either end, so
is the Bremen expected to be warped
stfugly Into the pier alongside the
Wlllehad here.
Interest was increased here today
by reports from Baltimore that the
tug Hansa, formerly the Timmins of
DeutBchland fame, was to leave that
port towing a barge loaded with rub
ber and nickle. There is as yet nj
positive information as to when th3
Bremen will arrive, but all indications
are that she will put in at this port.
Off Manomet Point, the Wlllehad
sighted a suspicious looking crift
bfading toward her and she chose a
course near the shore. The Wil'.c
had's pilot had received orders that,
if approached by hostile craft she
should be beached. The Wlllehad is
the first interned German steamship
to leave voluntarily the friendly
refuge of a harbor. The steamship
will not only be used to house the
Bremen's crew, but also to lay along
side and give protection if need be.
The WiUehad flew the German en
sign as she came Into the harbor and
was warped Into her berth on the
east side of the pier, headed down
stream.
Captain Htosch of the Eastern For
warding company, which represents
the firm operating the giant sub
marines Deutschland and Bremen,
was the first man aboard the Ger
man liner when she had docked. He
was accompanied hy J. F. MoGovem,
of Bridgeport, collector tor the Long
Island Sound district, and Deputies
Jtoseph Cometock and Jeremiah Dil
lon. They went into conference im
mediately wttih Captain Gatchens,
who brought the liner here from Bos
ton.
(MoGovern has been here for two
weeks, expecting the arrival of the
second undersea voyager, the Bre
men.
The Wlllehad was delayed In the
trip from Boston by the heavy fog
hanging over the sound and anchored
during the night in Buzzards Bay.
Reported Captured.
NEW YORK, Aug.. 25—The report
that the submarine Bremen had been
captured by the British, was repeated
today by the captain of a British mer
chant steamer who arrived aboard
the liner Baltic.
The skipper, who asked that his
name be withheld, said the Bremen
was caught in a steel net in the North
sea and swung helpless for four d&ys
until a British patrol boat discovered
her. Four of the submarine's crew
died from the foul air, he said, before
the submersible was towed Into
Dover.
The British admiralty kept the fact
secret, he said, fearing the Germans
would not start a third submarine for
America If they learned of the mishap
to the Bremen. Captain Finch of the
Baltic said he had heard the story,
bat knew nothing of its authenticity.

LONDON, Aug. 25.—Germany has
ordered the Bulgarians to discontinue
their advance into Greece, and to
evacuate occupied Greek territory,
fearing Greece will be drawn into the
war, according to an unconfirmed
wireless dispatch from Rome today.
Several Greek generals have re
fused to o'bey orders to evacuate east
ern Macedonia before the Bulgarian
advance, the dispatch said. Instead
of retiring, they have prepared to de
fend the eastern Macedonia fort.
The Greek government is said to
have laid this information before Ger
many, adding that public indignation
over the invasions has increased to
such an extent that the government
is no longer master of the situation.
Upon receipt of this information,
Germany ordered the Bulgarian with
drawal, It wag stated.
The Rome report thus far Is not
confirmed from any other source,
though it is a fact that onlv In east
ern Macedonia have the Buigars con
tinued their advance in the past forty
eight hours. After advancing nearly
thirty miles Into Greek territory and
occupying Kastorla, the Bulgarian
right wing taade no further progress.
Official despatches from German,
French and Efatlsh war offices attri
buted thla halt to the stubborn Serb
ian resistance.
The latest Athens despatches ap
parently contradict the Rome report
stating that the Greeks are evacuat
ing the region around the city of
Seres, under orders from the Greek
government.
Budapest despatches, reporting the
concentration of large bodies of Rus
sian troops on the Bessarablan-Rou
manlan frontier, evidently with the
purpose of crossing' Roumanla to in
vade Bulgaria and Hungary, aroused
intense interest today. The Buda
pest newspaper Az Est was quoted as
declaring that the Roumanian war
party Is becoming stronger and that
the Roumanian government has made
tentative preparation^ at the frontiers
making It eaBy for the Roumanian
forces to co-operate with the Rus
sians If Roumanla is drawn Into the
war.
Recent United Press dispatches
from Berlin asserted that Russian
diplomats are to ending- tiheir energies
at present, not to obtaining Rou

to obtaining permission for Russian
troops to crose Roumanla to attack

Railway Heads Discouraged
Today Over the Outlook of
Threatened Nation-Wide
Strike.
WORRIED OVER REVENUE
Only Thing Assured Is That the Ptffe
llo Will be Made to Pay When
the Matter Is
8ettled.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25.—The sev
eral million dollars worth of railway
presidents, who havs been working
here for several days to prevent the
threatened nation wide railway strike,
resumed their struggle today with
more desperation than hope shown in
the attitude of many of them.
"The situation Is less promising
than at any time since negotiations
started," said one of the most Im
portant railway heads.
Discouragement today grows out of
this problem: How to grant an eight
hour day and ffltflfB Tlffe public—liter
ally—pay the freight.
The railway heads want assurance
of a binding character that the in
creased cost of operating their lines
will be met by Increased revenues.
The best they have been able to get
Is President Wilson's agreement to
do "all that Is posslblo"—in case
thorough investigation shows after
the eight hour day has teen put in!
effect that the railways are in need
of relief. Years of operation already
have proved it, the railway presidents
say.
They Insist that guarantees of pro
tection against disaster for the roads
must- be made part of th settlement
at this time. The future is too un
certain, they say. WilBon's promises,
as one executive expressed it, might
not be worth much to the railways if
some other candidate were elected in
November.
If the president were re-elected, the
eTocutlves say, shippers and farmers
would make a powerful fight against
any legislation tending to foist upon
them the ultimate burden of expense.
They have promised this in a few
thousand telegrams to the railway
executives. This Is the new turn in
affairs reached by the executives.
The president, they say, has notified
them he can do nothing in a legis
lative way now, either toward secur
ing a commission for the settlement
of future labor disputes, or in the
matter of beneficial legislation to act
as "adequate compensation" for con
cessions by the roads.
None of the executives, however,
has given up hope that some way
out will be found. But few say the
solution can come through the eight
hour day proposal as offered by the
president. The committee of eight
has not at any time agresd to accept
such an eight hour day.
No Compromise Yet.
