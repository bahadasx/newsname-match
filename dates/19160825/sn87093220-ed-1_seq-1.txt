FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL
ASSIST LUMBER INDUSTRY
To Co-Operate With Manufacturers in Sending
Experts to Study Conditions of Lumber
Markets in Europe
PLANS MADE FOR EXTENSION OF MARKETS
War-Torn Area Will Need Great Quantities of
Materials. Favor Law Permitting Trade
Combinations
CHICAGO, Aug. 22.—(Special).—
The government will co-operate with
the lumber manufacturers of the Uni
ted States in sending abroad a corps
of experts to study the condition of
European lumber markets with a view
to a great expansion of the field of the
American producer.
This was decided today at one of
the most important conferences ever
held in American business history, for
the conference marked the opening of
steps for co-operation between te Na
tion's business man and the govern
ment itself for the extension of Amer
ican trade abroad.
Passing of Webb Bill Urged
Part of the result of the conference
will be the urging of the immediate
passage of the Webb bill, now pending
in congress, to remove any question
of the legality of the organization by
lumber manufacturers and other
groups of business men of foreign
sales agencies to secure and distribute
orders for American goods to be sent
to foreign countries.
The Government was represented at
today's conference by two members of
the federal trade commission. Will
H. Parry and Joseph E. Davies; by
head of the Forest Service, H. S.
Graves, and by the chief of the bureau
of foreign and domestic commerce.
Dr. E. E. Pratt. Dr. Wilson Compton,
•conomist to the trade commission,
was also present in an advisory ca
pacity.
Scores of Lumbermen Present.
On the part of the lumbermen there
were present some score of lumber
manufacturers and secretaries of lum
ber manufacturing organizations, in
cluding the National Manufacturers'
Association, the Southern Pine, Cali
fornia Redwood, West Coast. Northern
Pine. Northern Hemlock and Hardwood
and Gum Lumber Associations.
Before taking up the question of how
to organize the American lumber in
dustry to secure the great volume of
foreign lumber business that must
come to the United States, even be
fore the European war ends, detailed
reports were given of the conditions

abroad by the various interested or
ganizations, as well as from govern"
mental agencies. Briefly summarized,
these conditions are as follows:
Belgium—Forests entirely destroy
ed; the nation so wrecked physically
and financially that it will have to
be entirely rebuilt, and this rebuild
ing will have to be financed by '.he
major powers. •
Enormous Demand Shown
France —Northern France must be
rebuilt, enormous distances of rail
road lines laid, with a consequent de
mand, beyond estimate of quantity,
for railroad ties, sleepers and lum
ber to rebuild entirely the farm
buildings, villages and cities of North
ern France. This need will be defi
nite, regardless of the outcome of
the present war.
England—lts forest, as well as those
of Scotland, denuded, the supply of
lumber already exhausted, and im
ported lumber needed for all future
building, until new forests grow to
take the place of the timber cut to
use for war purposes.
Italy—The supply of timber is gone,
used in war operations, either for
Italy herself or her allies, and great
quantities in immediate demand.
Spain—The forests cut and the lum
ber sold to warring nations. j
j Germany— No estimate made of
conditions, but the need only less
than that of the allied powers in
proportion to the extent to which the
German government has foreseen the
future and prepared to meet the
emergency by the holding of great
| tracts as public forest.
j Russia has great supplies of stand
ing timber, Baltic pine chiefly, but
■ not, during the war at least, avail
j able to the other allies, and even after
peace is declared not suited to the
demand owing to its lower quality.
To secure this business, it vas
declared to be necessary only for
i the American lumbermen to go after
the trade systematically, with an ad
| vance knowledge of the needs of the
| various nations.

A REAL MUSICAL TREAT

That the concert given in the Grand

previous effort of local talent and
was a real musical treat is the opin
ion of all who enjoyed the event. The
concert was under the direction of
Mrs. Gertrude Croxall, and to her ef

of the occasion, which netted between
$300 and $400 for the mess fund of

Every one of the seventeen numbers

prolonged until midnight. On one
occasion the audience insisted so

Longshoremen's Strike End.

A meeting of business men interest
ed in the furtherance of the ship
building interests here was called
Tuesday night, by President Bruener,
of the Chamber of Commerce, at the
rooms of the Chamber at Hotel Wash
ington, and quite a number respond
ed.
A detailed statement of the dis
bursements of the two Aberdeen ship
yards during the few months they
have been in operation was read, show
ing that approximately $350,000 had
been spent, the most of which was
for labor and supplies purchased in
the city.
E. C. Finch, In advocating an effort
to secure additional manufacturing
enterprises, called attention to the
now famous plan adopted by the city
of Williamsburg, Pa., with tremen
dous success, and the secretary was
directed to secure all the information
possible relating to the Williamsburg
plan, for the benefit of the Chamber.
It was reported that while the
strike of the longshoremen on Grays
Harbor had not been formally called
off, all the men were at work, and
that the only abnormal conditions now
existing was that the union sailors
would not permit the union longshore
men to work on board the ships, un
til they were formally notified that
the strike was ended. A committee
consisting of W. C. Mumaw, J. J.
Kaufman and C. A. Holmer was ap
pointed to confer with the longshore
men about the strike being formally
terminated.
W. C. Mumaw directed attention to
the success of tlie four cheese fac
tories-, established within the past
two years in the eastern part of the
county, saying they produced cheese
valued at half a million dollars. The
establishment of these plants was due
largely to the efforts of Mr. Mumaw,
when president of the Chamber, who
saw the natural advantages possess
ed by this country for the dairy busi
'ness, and they have proved a suc
cess from the beginning, so much so
that two more are now being organ
ized, one at Ocosta and the other in
the North River valley.

Aberdeen lumbermen were hosts
Saturday for 24 Northwest Rite-Grade
Shingle manufacturers, who gathered
here to discuss trade conditions. The
men were enthusiastic over the suc
cess of their national advertising
campaign of the past few months and
most of them wanted to extend its
scope next year. The campaign of
the association in 1917 undoubtedly
will include concentrated advertising
in newspapers as well as in magazines
of national circulation. George M.
Cornwall, editor of the Timberman,
praised the advertising scheme for
Rite Grade shingles and told of the
great results which national advertis
ing of such things as oranges, raisins?
and soaps had done.
The visiting shingle men represent
ed Oregon, Washington and British
Columbia. In the morning the party
visited and inspected the Grays Harbor
and Wilcox shingle plants in South
Aberdeen. At noon the visitors were
the guests of W. J. Patterson at the
country club, and after luncheon en
gaged in an 18-hole handicap golf
tourney. In the evening the visitors
were entertained at dinner at Hotel
Washington, by E. C. Miller, at which
the tables were beautifully decorated
and vocal and instrumental music ren
dered.

OLE HANSON
FOR WILSON
Progressive Leader Declares
the Record of the President
Should Re-Elect Him
HAS PROGRESSIVE POLICY
Hughes Is Say-Notbing Candi
date, Says Ole. Old Battle
Cry Ineffective This Year
Tacoma, Aug. 23. —"Hughes Is the
say-nothing candidate," Ole Hanson,
one of the most prominent among the
progresive leaders of the state and
the Progressive candidate for the
United States senate in 1914, told the
Democrats who gathered at the Peer
less grill Thursday noon. "He offers
nothing constructive to the people of
this nation. Wilson stands for pro
gressive principles.
"President Wilson has caused to be
enacted into law many progressive
policies: the rural credit bill, enabling
the farmer to borrow money cheaply
with long-time easy payments; the
Income tax law, good roads laws, and
8-hour law for postal clerks, the child
labor law which he is trying to force
through congress. These are just ex
amples of the progressive measures
which Wilson stands for and enacts
into laws.
"Wilson has kept us out of war. He
Is a lover of peace, and is just now
trying to settle the railroad strike,
which will cause industrial chaos if
not mediated.
"The old battle cry of the Repub
lican party has been raised from every
office-seeker's lips. Woodrow Wilson
back in Washington Is confronting
problems today as serious almost as
confronted Lincoln at the beginning
of the Civil war. He is fighting the
battles of the people of this nation.
Night and day he is thinking and
planning for you and for me.
"It Is no time for partisan politics
or attacks on our president. As
American citizes it is our duty at
this time to silence the harsh criti
cisms and unthinking partisan preju
dice and stand by our president."
Mrs. H. H. Collier presided at the
meeting, which brought out one of the
largest gatherings sipce the campaign
opened. Mr. Hanson and George Fish
burne were the principal speakers.
Among the out-of-town visitors were
Roscoe Drumheller of Seattle, collector
of customs for the Puget Sound dis
trict, and T. W. Peeks of Seattle, for
merly one of tlie Progressive party
leaders of King county.
In honor of the members of Robert
Gray Chapter, D. A. R., Mrs. W. H.
Patton of Hoquiam. entertained Satur

Aberdeen were Mrs. Otis D. Hall. Mrs.

HON. GEORGE FISHBURNE
DISCUSSES HUGHES' SPEECH
Democratic Candidate (or Congress Calls Candi
date Hughes' Speech at Tacoma Stadium
A Funeral Oration
TARIFF CANNOT BE MADE A LIVE ISSUE
Tariff Commission Killed It. Republican Party
Was Unable to Comply With Promises
to Reduce Tariff
TACOMA, Aug. 23. —Commenting on
Candidate Charles E. Hughes' speech
in the Stadium, George Fishburne,
Democratic candidate for congress in
this district, in a speech at the demo
cratic luncheon Thursday noon, said:
"The tariff is a dead issue, killed
by the tariff commission, and so I
enjoyed the funeral oration of Justice
Hughes over the deceased. It brought
back to life our beloved friend, and I
could see him alive once more walk
ing up the streets of Washington,
D. C., hanging on the arm of Mark
Hanna.
Mr. Hughes reminded me of the
old doctor who could not cure his pa
tients of anything but the fits, and so
he had to give every patient a fit
before he could cure him. The justice
by a few dynamic 'ifs' and one Hughes'
vision, was enabled to give Uncle
Sam a competition fit, and then pro
ceeded to cure his distinguished pa
tient by ministering the old Mark
Hanna-Aldrich remedy of a high tariff.
It is true that hta treatment was rather
heroic. To make the invalid believe
that the war debts of Europe, their
millions of lost and disabled, their
quantities of property destroyed, were
only excellent, invigorating tonics
which would strengthen her and make
her ten itmes more to be dreaded as a
competitor after the war than she was
before, was calculated to produce both
fits and spasms, and it was too much
of a strain on our old Uncle for even
a man of his robust constitution to
stand it long. I beg to publicly an
nounce that since my discovery of his
fondness for debts, I can now honor
Judge Hughes in my will.
"In classic style, he showed how
protection benefited labor, but forgot
to mention that the wool manufac
turers of New England paid the lowest
wages when receiving the largest tar
iff subsity. The beauty of this part
of his speech was spoiled by the rec
ollection of the picture painted by
Senator Poindexter of the poverty, the
squalor and the misery of the employes
of the wool trust at the time it was
exacting from the American people its
most exorbitant tax period. And the
wool tariff was for 'the protection
Of labor.' How oft does the deed give
the lie to tlie word!
"The democrats and republicans both
advocate a tariff commission. A small
board of non-partisan or bi-partisan
experts would be better qualified to
investigate the complicated facts and
figures connected with the tariff, than
our too unwieldy houses of representa
tives. Owing to the fact that they
are to be appointed at large, rather
than elected from some state or dis
trict, they are more apt to recommend
tariff revisions in the interest of the
whole of the United States instead of
for the benefit of some isolated sec
tion, to make the tariff a United
States issue, instead of a 'local issue.'
We progressives and democrats are in
favor of leaving to this unbiased board
the question whether or not an Amer
ican industry should be protected or
not. We believe that their judgment
would be influenced neither by party
expediency nor by self-interest. There
fore, to make an argument for or
against 'protection,' or for or against
'for revenue only,' at this time, is
immaterial to the issues of the case
of Hughes vs. Wilson.
"To test which is more apt to fulfill
his promises through the instrumental
ity of their respective parties, let us
examine the record:
"In 1908, the republican party prom
ised to reduce the tariff, and failed
to keep their word. The fault was due
not to Mr. Taft, but to the power

behind the republican throne, the big
interests.
"In 1912, at the republican conven
tion, the progressives anil the stand
patters fought for control. The stand
patters in winning, lost, and the pro
gressives in losing, won, because the
formation of their party strengthened
the hand of Wilson so that the "big
stick' (really the progressives and
the independent sentiment of this
country) was transferred from Roose
velt to Wilson, and enabled him to
make into law every reform measure
advocated by the strong young party.
"In 1916, the progressives again
fought the old guard, but the latter
stood like a stone wall, and the pro
gressives again were defeated. The
machine, as a compromise measure,
selected Justice Hughes, because by
his four years of silence he had given
consent to their four years of opposi
tion to reform and their platform of
protest.
"Now, from this record we concede
that Mr. Hughes with such a party,
can fulfill his desire to restore an
other Paine-Aldrich bill and repeal
the Underwood tariff law, which con
tains the income tax, an old enemy
of his. But in addition to this, he
promises he will have only efficient
men in diplomatic and other import
ant services of the government, and
wiU abolish waste and extravagance,
and have America efficient. Fine
sentiments, those. We indorse them.
But he points out no means, no con
structive measures whereby he could
reach these ends. Why? Because if
he did, the lifeblood of his words
would be sucked out. The vampire
bosses would make Mr. Hughes a mere
futility.
"Mr. Hughes reminds me of a very
qultured and delightful old lady I
once knew, who was always saying
what she would do if she were presi
dent of the United States, or the king
of England. According to her, she
would make both countries 'pre
eminently efficient'; she would have
none but honest capable men to
fill every important position; virtue
here, instead of hereafter, would re
ceive its reward, and happiness would
be universal. She forgot, aH Mr.
for "t", existence Or IjosS
es Penrose, Barnes & Co., forgot that
they were all practical men and con
firmed believers in the divine right of
politicians to reward their friends. I
doubt not that if Boss Barnes could
hear Mr. Hughes talk, he would ex
claim in the language of Ibsen:
" 'Where all of this time will be
Penrose, God kissed on the brow.'
"It has been said that ingratitude
is worse than revenge, because re
venge merely gives evil for evil,
whereas ingratitude returns evil for
good. Let not the progressives show
ingratitude to the man who has trans
ferred their ideals into law. Let them
not forget the income tax (a part of
the Underwood tariff law so much
abused by Mr. Hughes). Let them not
forget the federal reserve act, tearing
from our throats the Iron claw of Wall
street. Let them not forget the federal
employment bureau, keeping the un
employed from hopelessly tramping
the streets. Let them not forget the
rural credits, enabling the farmer to
apitallze his industry. And this above
all others: Let them not forget that we
have peace, not war.
"Shall we turn back the hands on
the horologe of progress, to the
dollar-idealism of Mark Hanna, the
hour of war, or forward to the human
idealism of Woodrow Wilson, the hour
of peace?"
B. Miller has called for a meeting~of
