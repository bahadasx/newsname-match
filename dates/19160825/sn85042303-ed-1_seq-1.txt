WILSON CONFERS WITH BROTH- ESTIMATES OF
HOUR AND HALF CONFERENCE AT WHITE HOUSE TO
DAY BETWEEN WILSON AND EMPLOYES RAIL
ROAD HEADS THERE NOW.
Today's Conferences were Called to Discuss Proposals which
Have' Developed out of the Original Plan of Settling the
Controversy After Conference Between Wilson and the
Representatives of the Brotherhoods Today, Latter Re
fused to Discuss Conference, Other than their Spokesman,
Who Said Situation Remains Unchanged Some of Rail
road Heads Said to be Opposed to Eight-Hour Day Under
Any Conditions.
Washington, D. C, Aug. 25.
President Wilson summoned
representatives of the employ
ers and the employes involved
in the threatened railroad
strike to the White House to
day for a conference to dis
cuss the proposals which have
developed out of the original
plan of settlement.
The employes saw the presi
dent at 10:30 and the employ
ers later in the afternoon. The
four brotherhoods' heads re
mained with the president for
an hour and one-half, but
would not make any statement
on leaving.
"The situation, as far as we
are concerned," said A. R Gar
retson, spokesman for the em
ployes, "is absolutely unchang
ed. No complete plan upon
which the railroads, agree has
been tendered us. Our position
FJ
is the same as when we accept
ed the President's plan."
The strike negotiations have
resolved themselves, outward
ly at least, in to a more or less
confused state. Expressions of
i optimism are lacking, and the
feeling is general among the
managers that the plan to in
clude an eight-hour day will be
found impractical.
EPIDEMIC NOW DECLINING.
Another Big Drop in Number of New
Cases and De?th in New York.
New York, Aug. 25. The Infantile
par!yis epidemic showed another
big d.op today in the number of new
cases and deaths. Twenty-two fatali
ties a id ninety. four new cases were
recorded for the txrnty f.iur hours.
This is the lowest number in months.
Odd Fellows meet tonight ;ronitly
at S o'clock. Degree work.
LOCAL COTTON
LOCAL COTTON MEN ARE LOOK
ING FOR THE TOTAL TO REACH
ABOVE THE FIFTEEN THOUSAND
BALE MARK.
Kstimates by cotton buyers In this
city so far received place the total
to be marketed from wagons In this
city this season at considerably above
that received last year, when the
crop fell below the ten thousand
mark.
Most of the buyers Interviewed plac
tbelr figures around the fifteen-:hou-
I snnd-bale mark and according to the
present outlook their figures will not
be far wrong.
The railroads have cut off a lot of
the wagon receipts that formerly nine
to this city, which at one time ".'as
the l.irgeFt Inland cotton market in
the world, but a majority of the grow
ers would market tbeir cotton jeru
in spite of this fact If the roads of
the county were passable during the
fall and winter months. This Is
grave question that Is being agitated
by the business men of the city, and
will conie to a showdown when the
Board of County Commissioners next
convene and th question of voting a
bond issue is brought up.
The head of a new rake Is so equip
ped with a spring that all the material

INDIAN OFFICIALS BELIEVE THAT
A WHOLESALE FRAUD IS TN
CONTEMPLATION MAY STOP
PAYMENT.
Muskogee, okla., Aug. 21. Indian
t fllclals Thursday received reports
that government, checks fire being
forged and put lu circulation in the
Chickasaw and Choctaw nations where
a nlne-iuillion-dollar per capita pay
ment Is In progress. The first of
these alleged fpurious checks was pre
sented tit a bnnk nt Coalgale on Mon
day. Thia was filled out in the sum
of J.'ji) nnd was presented by an In
dian for payment. Federal officers be
lieve that the attempt to put It In
circulation was premature and that a
gang of counterfeiters had planned
to use the payment as a means of
defrauding the government out of
thousands of dollars.
The purported signature of Caho
K. Parker, superintendent, was affixed
to the check presented at Coalgate.
At the Five Tribes offices Thursday
it was said that none of the spurious
checks had turned up except at Coal
gV.te, go far as the officials were In
formed. The situation 13 regarded as
st riniis. It is generally known that
the bluest of Indian payment Is in
progress and merchants and bankers
could be made victims.
The Incident recalls tbe epidemic of
had checks pussed In the oil country
two or three years ago. Someone gat
out an issue of Prairie Oil and Gas
company checks which were cashed,
and several thousand dollars secured
from merchants.
