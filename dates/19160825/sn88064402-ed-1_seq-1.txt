0OLUME XVII. 'ELSH, JEFFERSON DAVIS PARISH, LOUISIANA, FRIDAY, AUGUST 25, 1916. N
sgR OF HIGHWAYS
PROGRESSIN6 RAPIDLY ,
Col W. L. Stephens, chief engineer t
of model roads construction for Jef- 1
faon Davis parish has twenty men I
at work divide d into two surveying
priesone crew working out of Jen
sings and the other from Welsh. The
work will be pushed while the weather
is favorable and it is expected that
within a couple of weeks stakes will
be set over a portion of the main
routes so that actual construction can
b&n if the authorities so desire.
gowever, it is likely that there will
lot be any work done 6n the new
rods until a little later as it seems
to be the wish of the taxpayers of
ia parish that the labor of man and
boast required for these improve
lgats be furnished by citizens of
jaff Davis parish, and just at pres
at the harvesting season has the
cost of these engaged.
There is also a movement on foot
tohbuild a bridge across the Mermen
tao river at Mermentau to create a
continuous highway through the two
perishes, Acadia and Jeff Davis as
will be seen by the following from the
Crowley Signal:
Plans for the construction of a
bridge across the Mermentau river on
the line between Jefferson Davis par
ish and Acadia parish are under way
sad the belief is expressed that the
gate Highway Department would
give material assistance in the work
if the police juries of Acadia and Jef
ferson Davis parishes can agree on
the plans. The expense to Acadia
perish, it is said, would be very light,
probably nothing more than the ex
pense of making the survey and
preparation of plans.
In this connection, W:'L. Stevens,
enginees in charge of the good roads
work in Jefferson Davis has written
the following letters, one to a lead
nag citizen of the parish and the other
to John M. Marsh, president of the
polce jury.
'he letter to a prominent citizen
of Crowley is as follows:
ar Sir: I am enclosing herewith
asp of letter written to the president
of the Police Jury which explains it
self. I think the Police Jury of Jef
ferson Davis will tal. imaedigse ac
tion to secure this bridge if your Po
lice Jury will join them, and as we
now have an opportunity to get
the bridge without cost to the par
ish, there should be no time lost in
taking the matter up. I have had
several conferences on the subject
with the State Highway Department
Sand have secured the necessary res
olutions which they would wish pass
ed, and if you can do anything to fa
cilitate this work, I will be glad to
come over and meet th' Jury. I am
interested in the construction of this
bridge in order to continue the road
coming from Calcasieu parish east
toward this city, and have no inter
est, whatever, in the erection of the
bridge, and do not expect any com
pensation for any services that I may
be able to render your Police Jury,
should they determine to seek state
aid. If the State Highway Depart
ment agrees to build the bridge the
work will be done under that, de
partment. Yours truly,
W. L. STEVENS.
FINE WEATHER FAVORS
EARLY RICE HARVEST
Prevailing fine weather is favoring
the harvest of the early rice crop in
this section. A great part of the
early Honduras crop and considera
ble Early Prolific, the new variety
originated by Sol. Wright of Crow
ley, which is being generally planted
this year for the first time, is al
ready in the shock.
Several lots of Honduras have been
threshed and are being stored in the
warehouses. The first lot of 1916
Honduras was brought to the Welsh
I Warehouse early in the week by Mr.
Geo. Lawson, Messrs. W. T. Butcher
and Geo. W. Cosner have also ware
3 housed lots of Honduras.
It is generally reported that the
- Honduras yield is only fair this year.
r No rice has been sold here yet this
e season, not enough having been re
ceived to create a market.
i It is reported that Tietje Brothers
of Roanoke sold a lot of 847 bags of
Honduras Tuesday to the Standard
t Mill of Crowley for a price of $31.18
- per barrel.

OR, LAZARO HOPEFUL
OF HIS RE-ELECTION
Dr. L. Lazaro who is touring the 7
seventh district in the interest of his Co
Icandidacy for congress paid the ing
Journal office a pleasant call this mor- wi.
ning. In speaking of the issues Dr. had toy
tht following to say:
"The congressional situation in the cai
Seventh district looks favorable to me. gr
My friends tell me that I will be re- thi
elected to Congress. The people un- ou
derstand the importance of keeping a pr
man there as long as he does his qu
duty. I will have served four years the
on the fourth of next March. I have th
made many friends in the House, tu;
Senate and the departments. I am w
now a member of the Committee on
Merchant Marine which framed ant ca
reported the shipping bill which will as
do more to build up the American be
merchant marine than any other to
measure that was ever enacted. The hi
war in Europe made us realize the
importance of building up an Amer- ha
ican merchant marine to carry the
products of our farms, forest, facto- if
ries and mines to the markets of the
world. I have been made chairman
of the Committee on Enrolled bills.
When the last tariff bill was framed
I stood by my pledge to the people vc
of the district and worked for a tar
iff on rice, sugar, lumber and other at
-products of the district. I worked
and voted against the reduction. I be
took the position that the protection
that results from a tariff should be fr
given to agricultural as well as man
ufactured products. I also supported
and voted for the bill creating the
tariff commission to be composed E
of experts to investigate the whole R
tariff question from a non-partisan, A
economic and scientific standpoint,
and to report to Congress from time p
to time. A permanent tariff' commis
sion will enable Congress to male the a
changes necessary to meet the ne
cessities without injury to any legtll
mate industry. I am directly inter
ested in agriculture, understand the, a
needs of the farmers and will con
tinue to look after their interests. I
supported and voted for the banking 6
and currency law which will forever
prevent such panics as we had in
1907. I also supported the rural cred
its law which will build up the agri
culture of this country and will
enable the farmers to borrow money
on long terms at a moderate rate of
interest. I also supported the Rood r
roads law and anti-trust laws. I am T
opposed to war but I voted for pre
paredness in order to avoid war. Ib
have always been the friend of water,
ways. I supported the measure cre
ating the special flood control com
mittee.
"My bill for a postoffice buildng at
DeRidder was reported favorably and
is now in the Omnibus bill. I have
had 22 rural routes including 3 au
tomobile routes created, covering 615
miles and serving 8,680 families; I
have 9 more pending.
On account of my work in Congress
and the experience I have gained I
believe that the people of our dis
trict wil re-elect me."
LOCAL AGRICULTURISIS

W. H. Tupper of Elton and H. C.
Fondren, parish demonstartion agent

EDWARDS ANNOUNCES
SPEAKING DATES
T. Arthur Edwards, candidate for
Congress, has announced his speak- 4
ing dates throughout the district. He I
will open his campaign at his home
town, Lake Charles on the 19th.
"I do not believe in a gum-shoe
campaign for the high office of con
gressman. Candidates who offer for
this office should be willing to come
out in the open before the people and
present their views on all public
questions and give their reasons why
the voters should elect them. Accord
the citizens cf the district an oppor
tunity to see them in action as it
were, in order that they may intelli
gently determine the fitness of the
candidate for the office to which he
aspires and what his appearance will
be and the showing he is calculated.
to make in presenting the claims of
his constituents before the working
committees at Washington and in the
halls of the national congress.
"The people will have very little,
if any, opportunity to judge a man's
ability and fitness for this office
merely from what may be whispered
in their ear by a gum-shoe candadate.
"I do not expect to get all of the
votes, but I do not hesitate to say
that I am well pleased with the situ
ation and believe that I will lead in
the first primary, and am certain to
be in the second.
"My official duties have kept me
from starting on my speaking tour
earlier."
