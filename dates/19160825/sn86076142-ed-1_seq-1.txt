WASHINGTON, AugUBt 25. The
railway strike negotiations have re
solved themselves, outwardly at least,
into a more or less confused slate.
Expressions of optimism on both
sides are not as free as they were
yesterday. The feeling, heretofore
general among the managers, to plan
to Include the eight hour day was
found not so evident. Some of the
executives adverted to the prediction
that eight hours would never be con
ceded.' The president kept the cabinet
waiting while lie conferred with the
brotherhood leaders' today. All par
ties to the conference steadfastly re
fused to say what was discussed.
The executives conferred among
.themselves as they studied the form
of their communication to the presi
dent. "The situation insofar as we are
concerned," A. B. Garretson, the
brotherhood spokesman, said, "Is ab
solutely unchanged. No complete
concrete proposition to which the
railroads will agree has been ten
dered us. Our position Is exactly the
same as when we accepted the presi
dent's plans. We have deviated
from It In no way whatever."
Later, Presidents Lovett, Holden
and Willard went to the White House.
It Is understood they would outline
the conclusions the select committee
of executives had reached. '
Some of the more optimistic among
the executives and trainmen still
hoped a final decision may be reached
tomorrow.

and managers that the eight hour day

SALT LAKE CITY, August 25. Mr.

of the great pipe organ, famed as one
of the larset in the world. Where
usually sit the apostles of the church,
just below the puplt, there sat last
night Invited guests of local promi

These seats were smothered In bunt

was bidden by national Hags. The
seating capacity of the house Is

Simon Bamberger, Democratic can

the church.

In the aisles and many others were
seeking to enter the tabernacle when
Gov. Spry, the chairman, started to
speak. The audience yelled at the
mention of the nominee's name.
When Mr. Hughes started to speak
the audience stood up and cheered
for two minutes.
"We have had under this adminis
tration," the nominee said, "law after
law enacted providing for the crea
tion of thousands ot places with pro
visions to the effect that it should
not be necessary in making the ap
pointments to conform to the merit
system, which is another way of say
ing they need not be made under
civil service regulations.
"Spurious excusVs were made. They
deceived no one. Every one of thOHe
clauses designed to make Inapplicable
the merit system was simply de
uleneil to afford an opportunity to
provtdepart1sairand political spoils
"We must sedulously guard against
that. So far as I am concerned, the
operation of the merit system will be
recognized and extended in order
that we Increase the standard of pub
lie work, that we elevate those stand
ards, that we may have efficiency In
the public service."
The nominee repeated his assertion
that the regular army should be
large and efficient enough to do
border duty Buch as Is now being
done by the national guards, and the
navy adequate to protect both coasts.
Hughes repeated his condemnation
of "pork barrel" legislation.
"The other day I pointed the finger
of scorn at the pork barrel bills
passed under this administration," he
said, "and Immediately there was a
flutter of the hit birds In the halls of
Congress."

LONDON, August 25. Striking simultaneously, the British and
French have made substantial gains on the Somme front, according
to Paris and London. Maurepas has fallen to the French, who have
pushed forward more than 200 yards beyond the town on a front of
a mile and a quarter. The British report a 300 yard advance south
of Thiepval and the capture of many prisoners.
The capture of Maurepas leaves Clery almost surrounded and
brings the French directly in front of the important railroad town
of Combles. Thiepval is in about the same position as Clery, and
the allied front as described now resembles the teeth ol a great saw
between which the Germans are tenaciously holding the ruins of
several villages.
The Italians, who are pushing their offensive on the extreme
north of the Austro-Italian line, claim the capture of several
Austrian positions. There has been an increase in artillery activity
along the Isonzo, but no infantry actions have been reported.
No change is reported from the east, but the Russian offensive
in Armenia apparently is assuming powerful proportions. Petrograd
reports the reoccupation of the important Armenian town of Mush
and the capture of 2300 prisoners in the battle at Rachta.
The situation on the Saloniki front remains obscure, but
apparently there has been no important change since the allied
flanks were forced back by the Bulgarians at the opening of the
offensive. There have been no further reports as to the attitude
of( Rumania and the main interest is centered now on Greece.
Athens dispatches report Greek volunteers rushing to Seres to take
up arms against the Bulgarians. Conflicting reports are being
received as to whether or not the Greeks and Bulgarians actually
have clashed. Reports to the Greek capitol state that fighting has
been going on at Seres for days. '
