spring, but they are not yet quite
i" j ready to disband and let the work al-
, i ready accomplished be the end, before
v 2 the town is scored by the State Health
I Inspector. There are Btill several
La places that are a menace to the health
mA. of our community. It seems that in
f, 3 these places the spirit of the clean-up
yf u few months ago did not last perma-
Wg nently and they are now in a deplor-
tjjiZ' able condition. Kecently a commit-
Wg tee from the general Clean-up commit-
Bp tee, and the Mayor, made an inspection
yg of the two slaughter houses from
p which our meat supply comes, also
jn the meat market, the rear of the
tS ' Cedars Hotel, Stores and Cosy Cor-
ner, und recommended to the proprie-
tors of these houses that they get
m busy before the State Inspector comes
SB and help the score out of the mire,
jtfr whore It now ranks for these places.
E Why ia it that the Health Board is
W blind to these conditions? If they are
jr Immediately looked after and cleaned
I up und the streets are cleaned of the
b, weeds, Cedar City bids fair to score
L high thlH fall.
HBMWtS -- The traveler passing through the
jpP$$S$$c: . town gets his impression of the entire
p, ' population from, theweds growing
; three or four feet high on each"sl"do
of the road, while the inside of lots
( and home surroundings, which are ex-
i" ceptjonally good throughout the town,
u fail entirely to mako an impression.
c The City owns a street grader which
'. h&3 been at the service of the people
$ all sumrner, and how many men have
: ft. availed themselves of this privilege
! und kept the weeds down along their
I Bf, ) ditch bonks. Very few. Surely there
j E' hove been days when the team was at
'P . liberty for just a few hours, and the
' few rods fronting each lot could havo
tc, -r been scraped free of weeds. To have
B", , a city beautiful there must be a strong
K community spirit. There must not be
B one cleared space flanked on each side
' hy foxtail, burdock and sunflowers
Hg- four feet high. The same spirit of
P? ' order, neatness and cleanliness must
Je'" move up one side of the street ami
& " down the other, and then will our
:'" broud streets be pleasing to the eyes
E of all who behold.
Kf Snturday is Garbage Day.
fe Next Saturday will be "garbage
p Day" and every one who hauls off a
load of garbage and reports to David
' Haight will receive 50c. a load. It is
f desired that all people having gar-
f; ' bage of any kind place it outside of
j" their fences and it is expected that
' there will be enough teams to carry
P. all refuse away. 9
When all this is said and done, and
i. wo hove scored highest in our class,
i after the State inspection is over, and
It comes homo tc ub that the clean
town campaign has not really been
l harmful and impossible to accomplish,
then only will the Clean-up Commit
tee accept the vote of thanks.

MAXWELL CAR MAKES
SOME NEW RECORDS
Lowers Time Between Spokane and
Seattle for Trains as Well
as for Automobiles.
All elapsed time records for the au
tomobile distance from Portland to
Spokane were broken Saturday when
Ray F. McNamara in his Maxwell
covered the 458 miles in 15 hours and
31 minutes.
The ear left the Broadway bridge,
Portland, at 3:21 Saturday morninr.
He passed throutrh tho Dalles nt fi:0r.
being four minutes behind the time
made by tho O. W. R. & N. Limited
train between these points. The car
reached Pendleton at 11:50, beating
the best previous record by over an
hour formerly held by Rov Ritner in a
Cadillac eight.
Spokane was reached at 0:52 Sat
urday evening, after beating the
Franklin record between Pendleton
and Walla Walla, finishing up with n
new record between Portland and Spo
kane. Not content with these records, Mc
Namara turned tho car west again and
started for Seattle. Mac forgot all
about auto records for this distance of
354 miles between Spokane and Seat
tle, and went after the fastest train
time, which he succeeded in breaking.
H is time was exactly 11 hours und 55
minutes, cutting tho train time bv over
an hour and passing all former auto
mobile records by over fivo hours.
Considering the fact that this run
was made across the eastern Wash
ington desert, crossing Blewitt Pass
m the Wenatchee Mountains and Sno
qualime Pass in the Cascades without
adding water to the radiator and with
out a mishap whatever, this record is
little short of phenomenal. Tho run
was officially checked by Spokane
new8papes and Douglas Shelor of the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer. Adv.

of the time in her rocker now.
The Record acknowledges receipt of
an invitation and complimentary tick
ets to attend the Dixie Fruit Festival,
which is to be held in St. Georgo Sep.
7 and 8. Whether we are ablo to ut
tend or not, wo appreciate tho cour
tesy, and know that those present will
have an enjoyablo time, as they al
ways do at the Dixie Fruit 'Festivals.
Mr. and Mrs. Alec Urie of Hamil
ton's Fort have tho sympathy of their
friends over the loss of their infant
daughter, which was buried last Sun
day. The child lived but a few hours,
being too frail in some particular for
a tussel with this hard old world, but
long enough to recoivo a name and
blessing. The Record extends sympa
thy to tho bereaved parents.
As a means of swelling tho treas
ury funds for the County Fair, tho
committee have purchased a shooting
gallery equipment and are conducting
a shooting gallery Immediately south
of The Record building. Try your
marksmanship, old scouts, the Fair
gets a bost every time you pull a trig
ger. The sport is proving quite pop
ular, too.
Dr. Wilkinson of Hurricane is a
hard booster for the Maxwell car.
He has ben driving one for some time
on tho Dixie roads, which are a severe

"PATRIOTS AND DESERVE
SOME GOOD PROFITS."
Raises the "Big Trust" Bugnljoo That
is Supposed to Put the Little Chap
Out of Business if Price is Lowered.
Cedar City, Utah, Aug. 20, lOHi.
Editor Iron County Record, Dear
Sir. The undersigned begs leave to
differ with The Rocord in tho attitude
it lias taken toward certain men and
measures it has tcecntlv snnn fif tn
assail. In this I am not alone, for I
am sure that 1 voice the sentiments of
a number of your readers who would
like to place themsolvef, also, in con
trast with the paper by expressing
publicly their unshaken confidence in
the fidelity and public-spiritcdncss of
tho men in question.
In so doing wo do not wish to ques
tion either the wisdom or the right of
the press to discuss freely and inde
pendently, any subject of public inter
est. It Is our belief, however, thnt a
constructive policy on any question
will be productive of more good thnn
the negative or destructive attitude
taken by The Record.
I sincerely deprecate the personal
ities indulged in so freely, and feel
that the reckless manner in which
Crominent names have some times
een dealt with, is nltotrothor wrnnr-
und can lend to no good end. Two
men in particular have been subjected
to a vindictive and merciless assault,
against which I protest. These men
are Governor William Spry and Bish
op Charles W. Nibley.
The two administrations of Govern
or Spry havo been singularly pro
gressive and successful. They have
been characterized by an honest and
economic expenditure of public funds.
They mark the period of greatest ma
terial advancement in tho history of
the stae, and this Jias been .particu
larly truo.of tho, country' districts, to
which class 'We' belong. ' Governor
Spry brought together in friendly po
litical and business intercourso ele
ments of society which before were
irreconcilable, and he has unflinching
ly upheld the dignity of the stato oven
in the face of nntional interference..
No governor since Brigham" Youwr
has shown the Interest in tho rural
affairs that Governor Spry hns shown,
and no governor has over worked moro
assiduously for tho upbuilding of tho
state. Tho State Institution located
in our own city has had no warmer
friend than he, and the South is in
debted to him more possibly than to
any one else for tho very liberal ex
penditure of state moneys on our
highways. This being true, it is in
bnd taste, to say tho least, for us who
havo received such consideration at
his hands to be hurling invectives at
him.
In one incident, und ono only, has
Governor Spry seriously disappointed
us, und that was in tho matter of
liquor legislation. Wo peprecato his
attitude on that question as sincerely
as The Record ever could, but wo do
not shnro its belief that he was and is
in league with prostitution und vice
und crime. Regretting, as wo do, the
veto he put upon a cherished enact
ment, wo still prefer to think ho acted
uui, ui nonesi. convictions, Knowing,
doubtless, when he did it that ho took
his political life in his hands.
I note in passing that it is a singu
lar fact that we who havo howled the
loudest are fartherest removed from
the big centers, und therefore least
able to judge the pressuro of senti
ment against tho measure at the time.
Ono thing is certain: Tho Governor
was not ulone. His nttitudo was re
flected also in tho legislature. It is
all too apparent now that tho legis
lature itself was trifling all along with
tho measure thnt it was not actuat-
ed with any overwhelming prohibition '
sentiment. It is significant, also '
that a very great number of the big
thinking men and women of tho stntc, i
regardless of political affiliation peo
ple whoso stand for prohibition is un
questioned havo not joined in the
outcry against tho governor. Possi
bly tho whole story has not been told.
Somo day it may como out and remove
the tarnish from an otherwl30 respect
ed namo.
At any rate, tho statement that
Gov. Spry's administration will go
down in history as the champions of
vice and crime" is furfetched, unrea
sonable and foolish. Is it right to let
ono act so completely overshadow two
administrations that havo been so
large in good to tho state? i
The second subject of assault has
been Bishop Charles W. Nibley.
Mr. Niblcy's sin seems to bo that ho
is officially connected with tho so
called Sugar Trust.
I have nothing to say in defense of
the Sugar Trust or any other trust,
nor uny protest to muko if Tho Rec
ord wants to fight them. But, in this
particular fight it occurs to me that
Tho Record has overlooked ono im
portant element. Tho Sugar industry
in Utah has beon Utah's biggest in
dustrial blessing, and likewiso to lose
it would bo our greatest possible in
dustrial calamity. Tho men whom
Tho Record assails put their money
into tho sugar industry in the begin
ning out of nn unselfish und patriotic
desire to start something that would
help to muko tho people moro Bclf
Bti8tuining. Hcber J. Grant und oth
er prominent men came through the
country begging the people to sub
scribe Bomo littlo of tho stock. They
candidly told us that it might never
bo dividend paying stock, but up
penled rather to our patriotism to
help establish an industry that would
mako employment for many and do
much to Btimulato a wider agricul
tural development. Thnt It would
oyer become a dividend paying propo
sition was scarcely dreamed of then.
Those who invested in it wore pntrl
ots pure and simple, for unquestion
ably it was tho public good rather
than privato jrain which actuated
them. This will be common knowl
edge to all who will hark back in
memory twenty to twenty-five years.
But things havo not turned out as
was expected. Many unforseen things
have worked around to favor tho in
dustry, and Tho Record Btyled "Sugar
Barons" inaugurated a wise und business-like
policy which not only vast
ly expanded the operations of the in
dustry, but has also made suirar stock
tho most attractive in the market.
After the long years of wniting, dur
ing which their energies were being
expended nnd their money brought no
returns, they are surely entitled to
somo good profits now. But thnt is
not tho point I wish to make.
It is my belief and this is tho point
I wish to impress that the policy
they have chosen to follow might be
taken cither out of a patriotic desire
to still nrcserve and extend their in
dustry for the good of all, or, out of
a purely selfish aim to swell their pri
vate fortunes through extortion. The
Record assumes the latter.
It appears to mo that two policies
aro open before them. They nan cut
the price of sugar, get into a big fight
with tho real sugar trust nnd prob
ably bo crushed out of existence; or,
they can fall in lino with trust-rcKU-
lated prices, keep peace in the family
and thus insure their continued ex
istence. Which is the wiser course?
Which will result in tho greatest good
to the pooplo? So far as I am con
cerned, wo can leave with perfect con
fidence the solution of that problem to
such public-spirited men as Bishop
Charles W. Nibley.
The Record charges that Bishop
Nibley is a "mercinary man." It
thinks ho is a calculating, cold-blooded,
conscienceless capitalist of tho
plutocratic type a man entirely un
fitted by temperament and business
associations-for the position of rirom
Incnce he holdsiIdo.nbt share dhls
opinion. I do not think a man of that
typo could ever reach tho position ho
holds, nor stay there long, if ho did.
I grnnt that ho is a shrewd, far-sighted,
successful business man, nnd am
glad to assert my faith in his integ
rity and my belief that his talents are
being generously given for tho com
mon good. The writor does not enjoy
a porsonul acquaintance with him,
but docs know something of his scru
pulous honesty in tho handling of
(trust funds. I know that thousands
upon thousands of dollars are being
poured into his hands by residents of
every hamlet and city in tho Inter
mountain country, nnd thoso who give
it feel an nbsolute assurance thnt ev
ery cent of it is being expended con
scientiously nnd judiciously for the
good of his co-religionists and the
upbuilding of tho West. Tho name of
Bishop Charles W. Nibley is written
largo in the confidence of the people.
It is also written large in many of the
bigger movements for the develop
ment of the West, and Tho Record
could herald it in many better ways
than it has chosen to do.
In conclusion, I recognize that The
Record has" made its fight out of a
sincere belief that it has been cham-
iiiuuniK me uuuhu ui me people, it
has always, in time gone by, taken
high moral ground. Its influence has
usually been cast on tho right side of
every public question and it has been
my pleasure in the past to support it.
However, in tho present discussion, I
feel that our paper has got off on
tho wrong foot, and it is my regret
that I cannot fully concur.
Respectfully submitted,
WM. R. PALMER.
