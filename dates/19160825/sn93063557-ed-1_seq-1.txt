out na follows:
A atock-judging dcmon8trntion by
I'rof. G. F. E. Storoy in which ho
worked with dniry cowa, drnft horses
nnd mutton shoep, using for his work
nnimnls furnished by aomo of the
nelghboring fnrmers. After thia dem

town hnll nnd grovo where cofiee, lco
water nnd fruit wns provided by tho
locnl Grnnge to supplemcnt tho lunch
brought by ench pnrty.
The nfternoon program wna presided
over by Judgo A. W. Foote, who in master
of tho Pomotm Grange nnd vice-presi-dent
of the Addison County Fnrmers'
nssocintion, the two organizntions which
co-opcrated inholdingthe meeting. Ho
introduced the following spcakcra:
J. E. Carrignn, County Agent; W. N.
Cady, master of tho State Grange; C.
M. Gardner, editor of the National
Grange Monthly; II. W. Collingwood,
editor of the Rural New Yorker; E. S.
Brighum, State Commissioner of Agri
culture; E. B. Cornwall, president of
the Addison County Farmers' associa
tion. Mr. Gardner spoke about the great
service thnt the Grange has rendered
to the farnvir, earrying out the high
ideals for which it was founded.
Mr. Collingwood, the other main
speaker, spoke of the progress of tho
world in the past, present nnd future.
Heemphasizcd the fact that co-opera-tive
effort had played a great part in
world progress, but that co-operation
was sadly lacking among farmers. If
we are to get better markets nnd raise
better products, we must strike "with
our fist and not just one finger," as
Mr. Collingwood fittingly put it.
This was a very good meeting nnd
probably will become an annual aflfair.

address full of life and vigor and setting
forth high ideals of a genuinely
"Better Vermont." A ball game be
tween Cornwall and Shorehnm resulted
in victory for the lntter.
In the evening a Mother Goose oper-
etta was given by a number of children
under the auspices and training
of the dover club, which was admirably
done and veryenthusiastically received.
A dance followed, lasting into the smaP
hours The attendance was large
throughout the day and evening and
everyone seemed to have a delightful
time. About one hundred dollars were
added to the treasurj of the society.
