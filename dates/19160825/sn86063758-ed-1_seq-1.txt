PRESIDENT WORKING
TO PREVENT STRIKE
Holds Conference With Railway
Executives in Effort to 'Avert
Strike.
Washington, Aug. 23.?In another
effort to aid the presidents of the
| country's railroads to find some way
j in which to accept an eight hour day
, for their trainmen and avert the

| tonight conferred for an hour an.l
a half with. President Hale Holden of
j the Burlington, Daniel JWftllard of the
Baltimore & Ohio and R. S. Lovett of
the Union Pacific.
Neither White House officials no.4
the presidents would discuss the conference.*
It was said on authority,
however, that the three executives
went to the White House to receive ar?
answer to the suggestion they made t :
Mr. Wilson last night that lie gire
them more specific information as to
how the railroads may get additional
revenue necessary to take care of th?
greater payrolls that will come with
the eight hour day.
Earlier in the day President Wilson
discussed the railroad situation at'
length with Senator Xewlands and
Representative Adamson. chairmen of
the two committees of congress in
charee of legislation affecting inter
state commerce. The two chairmen
are said to have agreed that the pres-*
ident's position in the present situation
was right, and to have said that
every effort could-be expected in congress
to put through nny legislation,
which might help solve the difficulty.
Congress Might Act.
One of the means for recouping suggested
by the president to the rail
roads in his public outline of his position
was through an increase ir?.
freight rates. It "vfras pointed out tonight
that the president can not di
rectly ask the interstate commerce
commission to grant increase to the
railroads. Congress, however, mtg't
pass a resolution directing the com
mission, in view of what it considers
'an unprecedented situation, to gran*,
higher rates.
Congress also might pass a resolution
directing the commission to investigate
all matters involved 'j. the

subject of the relations of railroads
and their employes. One result ex
pected from today's conference is an
early. effort to pass the bill introducsl
several months ago to increase the
comission's ^nemibersnip from seven
to nine.
It is become evident that mc,.t
o* the railroads executives have come
to believe that there can be only one
way of preventing a strike and that is
by accepting tlie eight hour day plan.
The chief effort in their own conre'
ences today was to find some scheme
b;. which an eight Hour day may ue
put in operation on all the railroads
at the lesat added expense.

1 Washington, Aug. 22.?Secretary

American members of the joint commission
to undertake settlement of
differences between the United States
and Mexico would be Franklin K.
Lane, secretary of interior; Judgt
George Gray of Wilmington, Del., and
Dr. John R. Mott of New York city.
All the commissioners have accept
ed their appointments, the Albican
members were name(i some time age,
and arrangements for their meeting
will be made immediately by Secretarv
Lansing and Eliseo Arredondo, Gen.
Carranza's ambassador designate. "Virtually
the only question to be decidea
i* where the session's shall be held.
The Mexicans are understood to pre.
fer some resort on the 'New Jerse>
coast.
Secretary Lane, who vill head the
American group, was the first member
selected. (Associate Justice Brandeis
was President Wilson's secona
choice, but after a conference with
Chief Justice White he decided his
duties would not permit him to serve.
Judge Gray, who is ia, retired federal
circuit judge and a former United
Statffj senator, has had much expe- ,
rience on international bodies and
since 1900 has been a member of the
international permanent court of ar
bitration unaer me iiuigue vuu*cution.
Mr. Mott is general secretary of
the international committee of the 1

author of numerous religious works.
He was offered the post of minlstei
to China by President '.WSlson, but declined
it.
The Mexican commissioners are
Luis Cabrera, minister of finance;
Ignacio Bonillas and Albert Pani.
Probably the first problem taken up
by the joint committee will be the I
proposed withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico. As Gen. Funston
has recommended the recall of Gen.
Pershing's expedition, this is expected
t( he agrreed to by the American mem- J
bers.
Gen. Carranza appointed bis commissioners

question, the negotiation of a protoc >1

border in pursuit of bandits and
