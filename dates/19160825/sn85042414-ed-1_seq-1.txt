Abel Void Performs Feat of
Strength After Car
Overturns.
Abel Void, 14, Seventh street, is
wearing his left arm in a sling today,
though for one fleeting moment fol
lowing the accident in which it was
broken, he was quite unaware of the
fracture.
Mr. Void, who travels for the W. F.
McLaughlin Coffee company, and H.
B. Tonjum, a fellow drummer, were
proceeding on a rough road a couple
of miles from Crary, N. D., at 7:30
o'clock in the evening, when the Ford
they were driving became unman
ageable and suddenly overturned. Mr.
Tonjum, who was driving, was pin
ioned under the car, but Void was
thrown clear of the vehicle.
The car was slowly crushing Mr.
Tonjum. Void, seeing his predica
ment, succeeded—he doesn't know
how—In righting the car and reliev
ing his companion from danger.
Shortly afterward, Mr. Void fainted
from excessive pain felt in his left
arm. An examination developed that
the limb had been fractured above
the elbow.

FROCLAMATOX, ISSUED TODAY.
SETS FORTH VEWS OF COUN
TRY ON PEACE—"BELGIUM
MUST ME IN GERMAN HANDS."
Berlin. Via London. Aug. 25.—A
proclamation, containing the views on
peace and conditions which might be
imposed by Germany, was published
today by the "Independent Commit
tee for a German Peace," an organ
ization formed some time ago by those
considered to be the extreme war ad
vocates in Germany.
The proclamation asserts that de
spite the faot that the Germans and
their allies are holding three king
doms In their hands, the Entente still
talks of the destruction of the Ger
man empire and Entente statesmen
continue to indulge In a flood of
abuse and lies about Germany, while
they themselves are violating every
principle of international law, forc
ing neutrals to enter the war against
their better judgment, and endeav
oring to force .jwhrn isslon through
tha%^hyniMHaii yiona-'yhom their
words- *e«£kMi^v^}ufsh, ...
The document ksserts that Russian
territory, from the Baltic to Volhy
nla must in the future be Included in
the German sphere to serve as a bul
wark against the Russian tendency to
annihilate Germany. France's re
venge Ideas must constantly be kept
in mind, so in the west also changes
would be necessary. Belgium in the
future either will be a German or an
English bulwark, so "real guaran
tees" here also are needed.
The document then recites the ex
pression of Dr. Petter Spahn, leader
of the Catholic center party in the
relchstag, that "Belgium must lie In
German hands, militarily, economical
ly and politically."
Concluding, the proclamation says:
"England's plan threatens us with
a political and economical helotry.
It aims at our life as a people and
as a state. It aims at our culture and
institutions. Energy must be applied
regardless of the consequences to
force peace upon this enemy. Let it
not come true that, as England says:
'We will not win all the battles, but
England will win the war.' With
von Hlndenburg let us say: 'It is not
only a question of sticking it out, but
of winning.""

pal subjects of discussion at the
eighteenth annual conference of the
American Hospital association here
September 26 to 30. Fifteen hun
dred professional hospital men are ex
pected to attend.
According to Dr. William H. Walsh,
former superintendent of the Munici
pal Hospital of this city, the conven
tion will take action toward estab
lishing uniformity in hospital work,
possibly even to the use of surgical
instruments, and toward placing the
nursing profession on the highest
plane. The question whether hospi
tals which reject venereal cases
should not be cut oft from state ap
propriations may also be considered.
Many members of the association be
lieve that a hospital should be pre
pared to receive any kind of a case,
even to contagious diseases. Many
persons who are seriously ill from a
contagious or venereal disease prefer
to undergo treatment at home rather
than feel the stigma of entering a
special hospital for the treatment of
such diseases.
The association will go on record,
it is predicted. In favor of a properly
organised dental clinic for every hos
pital. Inasmuch as physicians agree
that mouth treatment is of vital im
portance in the battle against germs.
The keynote of the discussion will
be sounded by Dr. John O. Hornsby
of Chicago, who will submit a report
on "The Standardization of Hospital
Organization" and the annual ad
dress of the president of the associa
tion by Dr. Wlnfred H. Smith, super

Strike negotiations resolved

that it never would-be con

Railroad executives con

might later go to the White

For the executives, this

"The executives are un

Some, still optimistic, had hopes
that a final decision would be reached
before tomorrow night. The opinion
that the eight-hour day will not be

Many executives are willing to con
