FORMER EARLING-
TON CITIZENS IN
DIG STORM
In a letter just received here from
Portland, Texas, some harrowing
scenes are recorded of the damage
done by the recent hurricane, which
struck Corpus Christi, Portland and
other cities in that vicinity. The one
in which our people are. more inter
ested, however, is the little town of
Portland, just eight miles across the
Bay from Corpus Christi, where live
a large number of former Earlington
and Hopkins county citizens. The
causeway, recently constructed at an
enormous expense connecting these
cities is ruined, the railroad bridge
torn away and telegraph- and tele
phone communication still cut off,
and the little city of Portland on the
bay is one of wreck and ruin. Much
live stock and vegetation was destroy
ed, but fortunately the Kentucky col
ony escaped with their lives.
The beautiful bungalow, formerly
occupied by O. H. McGary, but now
tne nome ot tne rresuytenan minis
ter, was entirely demolished and deb
ris from that building broke windows
in the home of H. C. Bourland close
by, letting in a terrific wind, accom
panied by rain.
The banisters and columns on the
porches and windows at the home of
Mrs. Harry Corey were torn away
and a heavy folding bed in her home
was overturned. The Christian
church was lifted from its foundation
and the little home of Mr. and Mrs.
J. E. Mothershead blown about six
inches from its original foundation.

Actor's Salaries Are as
Fleetihg as Summer
Snows
In the September American
Magazine a Broadway critic tells
the truth about actor.s salaries
H says:
"ino actor's reputeu salary is
snaro and a delusion' and
falso god not to bo worshiped, in
that it is intermittent' fleeting,
evanescent. It is a will-o'-the-
wiep, now here, now there, but
uever enduring. Any expert
ouce actor would with profound
gratification agree, to devote his
life to stage work if guaranteed
thirty weeks of employment.
One of the jokes porpetrated at
the expense of slackers at tho be
ginning of the war was, The.
English aotors at tho Lambs Club
in conference yesterday agreed
to notify their Government that
they would enlist in tho army
but only ou condition that they
should bo guaranteed thirty
woeks.' "
Speaking of strikers reminds
us that it is about time for the
ondarpnid newspaper publishers
to strike for higher subscription
rate?, inoreased jnb priuting
prices, and better compensation
in evory way. With printer's
supplies up in price from 25 to
100 poiv cent, abont tho only
profit mn tho publisher is his
experfouoe, and that has never
yet satisfied a gnawing stomach.
