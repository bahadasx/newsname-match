Chilberg was formerly presi

AOL. XIII. NO. 214.
= UNFIT
Senator W. J. Sutton, for all that he is a
mild sort of a person, is even a bigger menace
for the peace and prosperity of the state than
Representative Roland H. Hartley, the noisy
opponent of the union label, who is also a can
didate for governor.
The two—Sutton and Hartley—were mem
bers of the last legislature. Their records are
like two peas in a pod, and summed up in a
nutshell, their records show them to be ENE
MIES OF IMPROVED LABOR CONDI
TIONS.
To Hartley's credit be it said, he lias been
frank about it. He attacks union labor "agi
tators," as lie term them. He boasts be will
have nothing to do with the union label.
Sutton is "pussyfooting." But on every
vote, Sutton in the senate showed just an un
friendly attitude against labor ami social .jus
tice as Hartley did in the house.
George E. Lee, Hartley and Sutton, were
alike in their support of that infamous Senate
Bill No. 3(K), tbe offspring of S. B. 4t>, describ
ed as "the biggest attempted steal in any leg
islature."
Sutton, moreover, voted for the repeal of
the "full crew" law, a humanitarian measure
to protect the public as well as trainmen.
And in 1913, despite his Sunday school atti
tude in the present campaign. Senator Sutton
voted to legalize professional prize fighting.
Sutton and Hartley voted to throttle popu
lar direct legislation, for the restoration of the
boss system of political conventions in place
of a free direct primary, absented themselves
on the 8-hour public works law, and generally
failed to keep in step with the progress and
humanitarian views of the day.
LIKE GEORGE E. LEE'S, THEIR REC
ORDS ARE THE BEST ARGUMENTS FOR
THEIR DEFEAT.
