"Tropical Disturbance Lost'
(No Reward Offered)
That the tropical disturbance,
that was said, to be headed for
the Florida straits, has disap
peared, is evidenced by the fol
lowing advisory posted today by
Displayman Jolley, received from
the weather bureau in New Or
leans reading:
"Advisory 9 A. M. the failure
of the tropical disturbance to
reach Florida and the general
character of reports from Cuban
waters indicate that the distur
bance either has greatly dimin
ished in intensity or recurved to
the jiortheh&t over the Atlantic,
it is therefore advised, that na
vigation in Cuban and Central
American waters be resumed.
This closes the series of advices."
