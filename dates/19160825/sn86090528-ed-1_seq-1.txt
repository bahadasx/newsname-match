SEEM HOPELESSLY
AT LOGGERHEADS
President Wilson Makes No Pogrsss
With Executives and Urges No More
Demands on Employes
By United Press.
Washington, August 25. With Pres
ident Wilsoii and the railway presi
dents apparently hopelessly at logger
heads in their efforts to prevent a na
tionwide strike. President Wilson to
day stirred up some excitement by
calling the brotherhood heads to the
White House. Tho conference lasted
for an hour and a half, the partici
pants adjourning at; noon. According
to the brotherhood men it left the sit
uation unchanged.
After a conference with "Vice Pres
ident Marshall, President Wilson sent
word to the railroad presidents that
he would like to see them during the
day.
Employes Stand Par.
, Later tho brotherhood ehiefs said
they had not been asked by the presi
dent to accept a compromise and gave
tho impression that they would be ex
pected to stand firmly by the proposal
which they had accepted and tho rail
way executives had refused.
Charge Nation-Wide Lobby.
Tho employes Iiav placed before
President Wjlson f charge that a nation-wide
lobby Is' being conducted to
influenco sentiment in favor of the
railroads. They presented telegram s
showing that tho Northern Pacific was
paying for favorable messages for
warded from Washington. They told
tho president that pressure upon mem
bers of the employes committee for
the . 'ompt disposal of the issue were
becoming strong. They denied that
they had been asked by the president
to consider possible legislation by the
present congress.
Counter Propolis.
Washington, August 25. After con
tinued conferences yesterday between
President Wilson and the select com
mittee of railroad executives the situ
ation surrounding the threatened
strike was described last night as hav
ing narrowed down to the following:
The railroad presidents, at least
the seiect committee of eight, are
willing to accept the eight-hour
day insisted on by President Wil
son and the trainmen.
In return they ask that they be
assured as fully as possible that
all proper support be given and
' means bo used to assure them a
freight rate increase from the in
terstate commerce commission.
They ask also that congress cre
ate a permanent board of commis
sion, similar to the Canadian com
mission, to handle future labor dif
ficulties. A commission of this
character would be empowered to
Investigate when labor troubles
threaten and no strike could be
called or strike vote taken pend
ing its investigation a full report
of which would be made public
at its conclusion.
At the end of the investigation
arbitration would be suggested,
but if not accepted opportunity
would be given to the men to take
a strike vote. The balloting would
be secret.
Favored by Men.
These proposals were communicated
yesterday by Commissioner Chambers
of the federal board of mediation to
the representatives of the men who ap
parntly regarded them favorably.
Judge Chambers then reported to Pres
ident Wilson and a sub-ec-miuittoe of
railroad executives was summoned to
the White House.
None of them would say last night
whether President Wilson reported the
men would accept the proposal but it
was said that some encouragement was
felt as a result cf the negotiations.
