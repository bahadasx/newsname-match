President Wilson summoned

understood president Wilson wanted to
get their views on legislation under

Beards Of French Army
Doomed; Must Be Shaved,
Is Order To All Troops
Pans. France Aug. 23. The war
ministry has ordered all troops to par'
with the beard. Mustaches are allow
able, but not beards. All must go Gen.
Pierre Cherflls argues that the average
beard weighs 6w grams. With 2,000.00
men at the front, this means an aggre
gate welzht of 120 tons, a superfluous
weight from which the army should
be relieved.
Jean Richepln. the dramatist, writ
ing in the Fuse, says
"The beard has gone but what is the
difference to us? Let the beard fall
and French courage grow "
Auretes Rodin, the sculptor, says
' Men without beards, women with
out sex. statues without heads, bodies
without arms, humanity without weak
ness that is my opinion."
Maurice Barres gravely regrets the
passing of the beard which, he says,
was "a heritage of long ago in which
the dead lived asain and which bound
us mysteriously to the soul."
