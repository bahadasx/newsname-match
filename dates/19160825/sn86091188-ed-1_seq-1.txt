"A purty of five of us left San
Uiego Jan. 15, 1915, for Mexico for a
load of guano fertilizer, which we in
tended to take hack to San Pedro. On
board were Capt. George (Jiarke,
Mate Denis O'Keefe, myself, h youug
San Uiego high school boy named
Vincent Langden and the cook,whose
name 1 forget just now. On the way
out the mate died. The vesael was a
two masted schooner named the Em
ma.' We arrived safely at the Mexi
can port and were loading when a
terrible storm came up. There were
two customs officers of the Mexican
government aboard. The schooner was
plucked from ner moorings and we
were driven Into the ocean before one
of the wosrt storms 1 ever experienc
ed. We lost ou r way completely and
drifted for days and days. Because of
our unexpected and hasty departure
the supply of fresh water was very
low. Finally we drifted on the Is
land of Sorocco. which is about 300
miles from the mainland. There were
only two gallons of water left. There
was no water on the island.
It was physically Impossible for the
entire party to subsist on the two gal
lons of water while frying from the
mainland andtirmlly it was arranged
that the captain and the cook would
make an attempt to bring the boat to
the mainland or at least imtll they
met some friendly vessel, while my
self, Langdon aod the two Mexican
officials should remain on the Island
until help arrived. They left us some
flour, some earthen vessels and other
supplies and started f r the duo mile
cruise to the mainland. I never heard
about them any more and persume
they perished. The schooner was
leaking some at the tfme.
We were on the islaud for a whole
month. We dug a hole in the ground
and with the aid of a couple of jars |
which we ha.1 taken from the schoon
er distilled theaea water and so man
aged to escape dying of tlilist We
nearly died of hunger however. There
were a few wild eheep on the island
which, is about two miles long and
Is of volcanic origin While we were
there the Annie Larsen, an American
blockade runner, came to the island
with a shipload of ammunition, said
to be consigned to the Germans, wtio
were to meet the vessel at this point.
We pleaded with them to tike us
aboard but the'r water supply was
also very short and they refused. A
vessel was sighted many miles from
the Island enu the Annie Larsen

that the appoaching vessel was a
