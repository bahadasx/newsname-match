Afrnlil They Cannot Hold Men Much

If Alteration Is Promised.
Washington, Aug. 23. The rail
road employes' commlttcu showed
such marked signs of unrest today at
the delay In the negotiations between
1'rcaldent Wilson and tho railway ex
ecutives that tho leaders of tho men
wore alarmed and openly expressed
foara of their ability to hold them
much longer.
i An employes' meeting this morn
ing was thrown Into an uproar by
speeches of a minority, which de
manded lmmedlato action unless the
roads accept tho President's plan.but
tho leaders succeeded In adjourning
It before any vote could bo taken on
any of the various proposals. They
ld afterward that, whllo tho pre3
suro for Immediate action carao from
n minority, It was strong, but they
bcllovcd tho majority would "be will
ing to give tho President a llttlo moro
tlmo.
fcomer of tho men urged that most
of them go homo, leaving the broth
erhood heads with authority to call
a strike if tho railroads do not ac
cept the President's plan.
Tho meeting adjourned until 10
o'clock tomorrow morning. Fre
quently shouts and applauso were
hoard about a block away from the
hall.
PlajliiK for Time.
"It Is our belief," ono of tho com
mitteemen said, "that the railroads
ard playing for tlmo with tho Presi
dent, Just as they have done with us
for many months. There Is no rea
on why they should not have given
the President an answer by this
time. They nre tiring us out all
right, and tho men aro getting dis
gusted with the whole situation. I
think there aro enough coolheaded
committeemen here to control the
moetlngs a day or two longer, but tho
discontent Is spreading rapidly."
While the railroad executives con
tinued deliberations on what form of
counter proposal they shall make to
President Wilson's plan, tho Presi
dent conferred with Senator Now-
lands and 'Representative Adamson,
' chairman of the Interstate Commerce
Committees In Congress, about tho
hill to Increase tho membership of
the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion by two. Senator Ncwiands af
terward announced ho would piiBh
his bill immediately.' Tho develop
ment was taken to Indicate a move
ment for sending the investigation
features of tho President's plan to
tho commission.
Possibility of passing an eight-hour
law for railroads was discussed
among several Congressional leaders,
but no doflnlto program was evolv
ed, and it was understood no action
would bo taken unless tho President's
offorts failed.

Lexington, Ky., Aug. 22. Col. M.
F. Elkln, State Commander of tke
Maccabees, who returned from De
troit, where he attended special re
view of tho Supreme Tent of the Or
der of Maccabees, reports the ses
sion a most important one in that the
Maccabee law was amended to con
form to the ritual of the order rela
tlvo to the continuance In force of
lnsurancepf njombefs engaged In war
and tho completion of arrangements
for tho maintenance of the Macca
beo Home at Pittsburg.
Heretofore laws of the order con
tained a clause canceling lusurance
of members enlisting as soldlers.this
was regarded as contradictory to tho
ritual. For maintenance of tho Mac
cabeo Homo at Pittsburgh, which Is
for infirm, indignant and tuberculosis
members of the order, an additional
assessment of twenty cents per year
payablo semi-annually was imposed
on oil old members for a period of
flvo years, while on all now members
an extra of $1 was placed. There
aro over 300,000 Maccabees In tho
United States and it is figured that
this nominal assessment will produco
sulllclent revenue to support the in
stitution. -

WILSON THREATENS
TO USE VETO POWER
LET IT BE KNOWN THAT HE
WOULD NOT STAND FOR IM
MIGRATION BILL.
Washington, Aug. 22. President
Wilson let it be known, today that
ho would veto the immigration bill
if it came before him again with
the literacy test, and with that the
Senate defeated the motion to take
up the measure, and return to con
sideration of the revenue bill. ' '
The President's announcement,
which settled the question, arrived
Just when the Democrats wero con
tinuing their party row over the ac
tion of the nine revolting Democrats
who refused to be bound by the cau
cus which decided to let the bill go
over, and the leaders of the revolt
were making caustic replies to the
reproaches of Senator Stone.
On tho President a word that he
would veto the bill, five of the re
volting Democrats turned about and
voted against the motion to take it
up. They were Senators Beckham,
Chamberlain, Culberson, Lane and
Overman. They made the voto 32
to 23.
Senators Ashurst, Hardwick, My
ers, Smith, of South- Carolina, and
Vardaman, all Democrats, however,
stuck to their votes to take it up.
The Senate's action means that ef
forts to consider the bill at this ses
sion probably will be dropped.
President Wilson today vetoed a
bill allowing cities and townships to
buy public lands, including forest
lands, In their vicinity for parks,
cemeteries and sewerage. The Pres
ident vetoed the bill on the ground
that the national forests should not
bo utilized in that way.

STARTS BATTLE ROYAL
Senator Simmons Tries To DlsprovO
Charges of Extravagance With,
Figures.
Washington, Aug. 22. With Sen
ator Simmons, chairman of the Fi
nance Committee, submitting flgurea
designed to disprove Republican
charges of Democratic extravagance
and Senator Smoot, Republican fi
nance expert, asserting that the Dem
ocratic party should bo convicted of
attempting to procure votes under
false pretenses, a general debato on
the $205,000,000 emergency revenue
bill began today In tho Senate. Thero
were Indications on every hand of a
partisan battle royal to be waged for
several days.
Insisting that national defense pre
paredness and' the Mexican situation
were responsible altogether for the
necessity of special revenue legisla
tion and a proposed bond issue, Sen
ator Simmons declared Republicans
in Congress had clamored for even
greater expenditures for defense, and
having done this, were seeking par
tisan advantage by making false
charges of Democratic extravagance
to the public.
Senator Smoot, opening the Ite
pnblican assault on the revenue bill,
said if'the Democratic party was to
be retained in control of the govern
ment, the country would "suffer an
era of unequaled extravagance com
bined with inefficiency unsurpassed'
His attack was supported by- Senator
Curtis, who asserted that the burden
of taxation should not be placed on
the American people and that reven
ues should be raised by a protective
tariff.
To prove his contentions that nor
mal appropriations of this session
aro 11 dt excessive, Senator Simmons
submitted Treasury Department es
timates for the year 1917 showing
that, excluding postal appropriations,
bond issues already Issued and
amounts that will not be expended,
revenues must be provided for dis
bursements of $1,126,243,000. Of
this amount the total appropriated
for national defense would aggregate
about $654,000,000, and the Sena
tor submitted other figures to prove
that this extraordinary amount, due
to preparedness and the Mexican
emergency, exceeded normal defense
appropriations by about $372,280,
000. Senator Curtis predicted "four or
five deficiency appropriations" before
the year 1917 is over, advocated a
return, to the protective tariff and
declared tho Republican party was
"opposed to a war tax in a time of
peace."
Just before adjournment Senator
Penrose introduced a resolution to
recommend tho revenue bill to tho
Finance Committee with Instructions
that it be amended to raise an equit
able portion of required revenue from
a protective tariff. No action was
taken on the proposal.
Senator Smoot asserted that tho
Democratic party had not kept tho
pledges of retrenchment and economy
and charged it with "wasteful and
useless expenditures too long for
enumeration."
"If wo could bring the Democratic
party Into a court of Justice and In
dict and try that party undor tho
rules of law," said the Utah Senator,
"tho evidence that could bo submit
ted would be more than adequato to
convict It of procuring votes under
false pretense
Pcoplo To Bo Judge.
"Unfortunately, we can havo no
trial under the rules of law, but,
which Is undoubtedly better, wo shall
have a trial beforo tho great tribunal
of tho Amorlcan people whoso Yerdict
will bo given as Impartially as ever
was given by a Jury of twelvo good
men and true, and wo shall know on
the 8th of November whother, In tho
opinion of the Jury of Juries, tho
Democratic party has kept Its econo
my pledge In oftico as zealously as it
relied upon that pledge during the
campaign. . .
