file notice thoo hi tho local

parks, giving the valley and
city its symbolic nnme.
Its Equipment.
"The equipment must be ade
quate and commensurate with
tht? UnlYtrsnl demand, crying
need, and magnitude f the un
dertaking. A main building
costing not less than $200,000.00
will be erected, with other build
ings, for offices, frower plant,
laundry, cottages, and every de
tail of equipment- equaling the
very best that can be had, for
this most laudable movement.
.Its Object and Purpose.
"The object and purpose of
the National Free Tubercular
Sanatorium Association is pure
ly and strictly humanitarian.
Thet'e ai no profits or dividends
for any one. ArM;k No. 11 of
the Charter reads as follows:
The object of this Association
is the acquisition, eriection,
ownership and maintenance of
a Sanatorium or hospital for the
treatment (? j'yiKOfi.s suffering
from tuberculosis. Thrj who
have no money to pay for their
cai'e t!i4 treatment shall be
treated fre-j ut charge under
such rules and requireiHMits for
admission as may be adopted by
the mcfiiagenient of the Associ
ation Tboo who desire to
Haifie to the Institution for treat
ment that have tb money to
pay shall be charged for the
same but all money received
from tho patient's treatment at
this institution shall be Uoed in
the extension and promotion of
the scientific and charrity Work
Lff the Association.' Section
No. II of the Same Article reads:
'A further object of this Asso
ciation in so far as its finances
will permit, ehall be the con
ducting of a iiicdicl research
into the causes, prevention and
cure of Tuberculosis.'
"Thus it will be seen that in
addition to its care of consump
tive patients, the Sanatorium'
will maintain a research depart
ment which, it is expected will
rival the similar departments
of the far famed medical insti
tutions of Europe. Ths institu
tion will also carry on a nation
wide program uid agitation of
of prevention, by means of an
'Information and Prevention'
department, which will un
doubtedly do an enormous
amount of good throughout the
country.
' Competent men with world
wide fame in the tubercular
world, will be in control of this
vast important department, ai d
it is confidently expected that
through this department, there
will be brought fourth eventual
ly, a permanent cure for tuber
culosis. - The whole world will
hail the coming of that glad
day! That day is coming. The
great Pasteur said, 'I believe
that every genu oistase can be
eventually wiped from tho face
of the earth.'
How Maintained.
"The institution will bo main
tained and supported principal
ly, by voluntary gifts and en
dowments by Its thousands of
friends that will become inter
bsted, and be raised up to give
it aid. On account of being
free, undenominational and
charitable, in its management,
it will appeal to. oil classes of
people.
"Another source of income
will be from those patients who
are financially able to bear their
expense for treatment. All who.
can do so will bear their own
expense, otherwise their care
and treatment will be free.
There are hundreds of philan
thropic persons who will b
glad to endow an institution of
this nature just as soon as they
are informed of its mission and
method of woik.
"Many will make their con
tributions extend over a period
of ynars, giving so much cash
down, and so much yearly for
five or ten years. In this way
the institution will be assured
of a permanent income, and as
it grows and its work becomes
known, multitudes will rally to
its s.upport. There is no great
er work in all thp world to' bo
done any whore, th;m the sup
port of a work like tliiff..
How Controlled.
"The control) -and business
management of the institution
is vested in a board of directors
and advisors, consisting of
twenty-six members among
whom are some of the most suc
cessful business men of Alamo
gordo. They are all men of
high standing and sterling
worth.
Its Charges.
"As lias already leen stated
there will be absolutely no
charges for those who are un
able to pay, but for those who
are able to pay there will be a
reanunable charge made for all
services. This fee will in every
instance be used to support the
work. f
"The object of tho Associa
tion being primarily to aid and
care for the needy and helpless.
they will be given the prefer
ence if at any time there shall
be lack of room.
"This rule will be adhered to,
b?cause there are many private
Sanatoriums where those who
can pay may betaken care of,
while the penniless could not
gain admission.
"We believe, however, that
the .support of the institution
will be so generous and hearty
that there will bo room and
funds for all. We can think of
no class of people who will not
bo quick to respond to the ap
pal for a work like this.''
