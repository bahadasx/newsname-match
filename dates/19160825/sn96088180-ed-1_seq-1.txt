The Bremen's cargo will probably be
transferred to the Willehad, which
will act as a "mother ship" for the

' they are In port, and also protecting
the submersible from enemy eyes. As

London, Aug. 25. Germany has
ordered the Bulgarians to discontinue
their advance Into Greece and to eva
cuate occupied Greek territory, fear
ing Greece will be drawn Into the war,
according to an unconfirmed wireless
dispatch from Rome today. Several
Greek generals have refused to obey
orders to evacuate eastern Macedonia
before the Bulgarian advance, the dis
patch said. Instead of retiring, they
have prepared to defend the eastern
Macedonia front. The Greek govern
ment Is said to have laid this Informa
tion before Germany, adding that
public Indignation over the Invasions
hai Increased to inch an extent that
the government Is no longer master
of the situation. Upon receipt of this
Information, Germany ordered the
Bulgarian withdrawal. It wis stated.
The Rome story tbua far Is not
confirmed from any other source,
though It Is 'a fact that only In east
n Macedonia have the Bulgarians
continued their advance In the 'past
48 hours. After being SO miles Into

Washington, Aug. 25. ; With Pres
ident Wilson and the railway presi
dents apparently hopelessly at log
gerheads In their efforts to prevent
tho threatened strike, the president
today atlrred up excitement by sud
denly calling the heads of the rail
road brotherhoods to the White
House.
The conference with the brother
hoods lusted an hour anti a half,
adjourning JiiHt at noon. According
to the workers' representatives, how
ever, it left the situation unchanged.
They were asked to accept no com
promise, the brotherhood chief Bald,
and gave the impression as they left
the White House that President Wil
son might he expected to stand firm
ly by the proposal which they have
accepted, but which the railway pres
idents refuse.
The brotherhood men, while at the
White House, placed before the pres
ident the charge that a nation-wide
lobby la being conducted to influence
sentimont tn favor of the railroads.
They presented telegrams to show
that the Northern Pacific railway is
paying for favorable messages for

ing message, the brotherhood heads
said, was sent by Superintendent J.
L. Derorce of the Northern Pacific,
to all agents of his road:
"It la highly important to get train
men question discussed by farmers,
stock raisers, dairymen and merch
ants. Please get as many of Jhese

By John H. Hearley
' With the Italian Army, Near Gor
Itz. Aug.' 25. General Cadorna has
pressed his lines to within fourteen
miles of Trieste and la gradually
making progross In the difficult moun
tain country where the Austrlans are
clinging to their positions with the
utmost tenacity. . ,
In the past 24 hours I have travel

of the town, the Italians have takjen
the Austrian second line trenches and
at some places have penetrated the
enemy third line trenches. For sev

In the terrific hall or shells In this
sector.
The Carso pleateau Is potted with
great shell craters. The great frag
ments of rocks torn from their bases
by the artlllerylng that preceded the
capture of the barren peaks of Monte
San Mlchele, lie across shell-craters
filled with bodies, creating great
tombs.
The opposing lines are so close to
gether on the Carso plate.au tbat the
men must be' constantly on guard
during the day time to avoid snipers'

for from station funds and statement

want you to send copies ot these tele

mitted , to the president, using our
own wires for this. Might be well to
have some of the most prominent
signers send message to their con
gressmen and senators tn Washington
In addition to those sent to President
Wilson. This is very important and
must be given preference over normal
business today."
The pressure from their members
for prompt disposal of the Issue with
the railroads is becoming strong, the
brotherhood officials told the presi
dent. W.G. Lee. president of the
trainmen's union, showed the follow
ing telegram from brotherhood mem
bers at Whltefish, Mont:
"National conference committee of
managers requesting business men of
the United States to wire President
Wilson, insisting that he change his
attitude regarding eight-hour con
troversy and Insist on arbitration.
Brotherhood members Whltefish' In
sist prompt action be taken to dispose
of this controversy or force Issue as
authorised by strike. Refuse arbitral
tlon proposition for eight-hour day."
The brotherhood men dented speci
fically that they had been asked by
the president to consider possible
legislation by the present congress.
"The situation Is Just rocking
along," said A. B. Garretsofv or the
conductors' union. "There will be no
compromise."
Washington, Aug. 26. -The con
ference o railroad executives broke
up at 3:58 p. m. with the Question
ot their course of action still unde

Berlin; Aug. 25. An American
flag was flying at the Deutschland's
mast when the first commerce sub
marine to cross the Atlantic returned
to her home port.
Thousands of school children were
crowded along the banks of the
Weser, singing national songs, and
yachts, tugs, sloops and other small
craft moved about to catch a glimpse
of Germany's new marvel.
By Carl W. Ackerman
We left Bremen aboard the Gazelle
and Journeyed toward Bremerhaven.
In the distance the Deutschland ap
peared, swimming low like a duck,
escorted by two tugs and followed by
another ship carrying the guests of
honor, including Count Zeppelin, Dr.
Helfferlch and other minister The
ships whistled salutes. It was most
impressive to see the Germans ob
taining their first view of the
Deutschland. r
We rode alongside the Deutschland
as she moved toward her dock. She
bore no scratches. The only evidence
of her long sea Journey was the fact
that she was blackened aft from the
smoky exhaust. She entered Bremen
harbor under her own steam, while
bands played "Deutschland neber
alles." and anchored beside the spe
cial tug at 12:10 p. m., where she was
officially welcomed.

London, Aug. 25. Six Zeppelins
took part in last night's raid on the
English east coast, the second within
24 hours, General French, command
er of the home foives, reported today.
The Zeppelins were violently at
tacked by anti-aircraft guns and by
a BrltUh aviator, who dashed In at
close range, despite the Zeppelins'
fire, and turned his machine gun
loose upon a dirigible. The Zeppelin
escaped by mounting high in the
clouds, where the pursuing aeroplane
was unable to follow her because of
the heavy mists.
Total casualties have not yet been
reported, and the number 'of bombs
dropped Is uncertain. Several bombs
were directed at ships along the sea
