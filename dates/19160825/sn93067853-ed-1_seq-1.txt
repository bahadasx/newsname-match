(By Special Reporter)
The State campaign meeting was
held at Union on Tuesday, August
22nd, in the City park. When the
meeting was called to order by Macbeth
Young, county president, about
2200 people had assembled. The day
was fair; the crowd was orderlv:
every candidate was given a fair, at-|
Ventive and interested hearing.
The first to speak were the candidates
for railroad commissioner. Mr.
McDuffie Hampton, the present incumbent,
who is seeking reelection,
was the first speaker. He asked reelection
upon his capacity to do the
work required; his qualifications for
for the office, and his record as a
commissioner. He is a civil engineer
v profession, his training as such
fits him to attend to, and carefully
look after the physical condition of
e railroads; that the other commissioners,
realizing his fitness for this
particular line of work, had selected
;m to make practically all of the inspections.
That as fast as possible
was having the railroads eliminate
all wooden trestles, and in their place
put up steel trestles, or fill in. That
today we had lower express rates than
ever before; that he had helped to get
them, had even appeared before the
legislature. That he had given all
of his time to the duties of the office,
and had been absolutely non-partisan
his duties.
Mr. Albert S. Fant of Belton was
the next SDeaker. He came with the
unanimous endorsement of the chftnrw
ber of commerce of Belton, the Democratic
club of Belton and the Democratic
convention of Anderson county.
Further, his record as a citizen, business
man and auditor of the South
SHiSsSS'S
tloirT TTiat the commission has great
powers; one is the power to fix rates.
Stands for low freight rates. Believes
in the enforcement of law.
Promises that if he is elected he will
be honest; that he will render competent
services, and that he will be
faithful to the trust of the people.
That he is the candidate of no man,
or set of men; but will be true to the
people. Has had 13 years' experience
in banking.
n. W IT T/.n - * <-* ' 1
m. ??. n. iveuey 01 apartanuurg
was the next speaker; that he was
endorsed by the Spartanburg county
Democratic convention. Believes that
he is competent to deal fairly between
the people and the railroads. Believes
in encouraging the railroads to build
lines into the rural districts of South
Carolina; is in favor of having better
depots and cleaner and more sanitary
toilet facilities around the depots. Is
in favor of better system of schedules,
and thinks eight |hours per day is
enough to require the operatives to
work. Stands for a square deal between
the people and the railroads.
W. T. Thrower of Cheraw said that
the proper management of railroads
was of national importance, that particularly
was it important for South
Carolina because Charleston was the
doorway to Panama. That formerly
railroad rates was figured on what a
horse was able to do in a day, that
a rate was charged per mile and what
it would cost to be conveyed by a
horse; that from this becrinninj'
tariff rate evolved. That the whole
principle was wrong, because it was
founded upon the principle of discrimination,
and is continued until
now; that towns are discriminated
I against. That some towns closer to
market are charged a higher rate than
thbse a greater distance away. That
the cotton mills of South Carolina are
discriminated against in favor of the
New England mills; that as it now
stands it cost 33 per cent more to
transport the raw cotton than it does
to transport the finished product.
Promised if elected to try to remedy
this situation.
Jas. Cansler of Tirzah believed that
he is entitled to the office on account
of the fact that he had been running
long enough to prove to all the people
that- ho ia oflfipiont KAnoaf
.? W?WW..V, aivucov ?uu tapnble
of filling the office, and that if he
can't beat the present bunch that he
need not try again. Believes that six
years in this office is long enough.
That he believes in the principle of
I arbitration that although Hampton
claims to be a civil engineer he went
to the legislature and asked them to
give the railf".id u mmisf-irn one. Is
a farmer.
Aspirants for the office of lieutenant
governor spoke next:

the first speaker. Was born in South
Carolina, was educated in the public

schools of the State, and at Clemson
College and the Medical College of
South Carolina. Js in favor of fostering
and encouraging all educational
institutions; favors aiding rural
schools and helping the institutions
of higher learning. Believes in the
proper enforcement of law and ordei
in South Carolina. Believes, too, ir
betterment of road conditions. Believes
in the proper and liberal support
of the Confederate soldier. Promise'
that if he is elected that he will
stay in South Carolina, and will not
go to Europe, the guest of Henry Ford
t.n a cheap junketing trip. Referred
I to the incident in Chesterfield when
be was attacked by a man named
Wiikes, who is said to be an overseei
on the farm of Bethea Bros. Alsr
referred to the Code of South Carolina
for 1912, and criticized Bethea's work
on it while he was code-commissioner,
A. J. Bethea, present lieutenant
governor, said that criticism was the
price that one had to pay for having
an ideal. That his trip to Europe, the
guest of Mr. Ford, was a very valuable
one, and that he learned many lessons
that were very valuable both tc
himself and to South Carolina.
That. while in Denmark he learned
'iow a man and his family was supported
on six acres of land; while ir
Germany a man and his family was
supported on ten acres; that we must
learn from them the lesson in intene
: rru - . 1
nirru i aiming. mat ne was in lavoi
of a Rural Credit bill, such a law that
wculd enable the poor white tenant
to be able to buy a home for himself
and family. That he was in favor of
a State warehouse system, under
proper control; and was in favor of
the extension of the educational system
of South Carolina, giving to every
boy and girl a chance and an opportunity
to get a good education.
Believes in the liberal support of evipry
Confederate soldier, or to his widow,
and believes in granting a penlion
to every one who reaches or attains
the age of 70 years. Endorses
the National Democratic platform,
and is in favor of the reelection of
Woo<Jrow Wilson as pnddMt
favor of clean politics, and wishes to
see factionalism buried. Believes also
in the strict enforcement of all the
laws on the statute books. That is
was an important office, much more
so than was realized, for should the
governor die, then the lieutenant governor
would become governor of South
Carolina.
Mr. W. B. Dove, a candidate foi
secretary of state, was the next speaker.
This was his first time in politics,
and he was asking for the office
on his merits, and on his ability tc
fill the office satisfactorily both tc
mself and to the people of South
Carolina. That the office was an important
one. Every official act of the
governor of South Carolina has to be
si^nea Dy tne secretary of state; all
commissions are issued by him; all
charters in the State are granted by
this office. That he has been chiel
clerk in the office for eight years; began
at a salary of $1350 per year;
knows all the duties of the office thoroughly,
but it is not asking for the
office on the ground of charity, but
on his ability alone. Has taugnl
school for 12 years, and if the people
will not trust him as their official, car
go back to the school room.
Mr. Geo. W. Wightman of Saluda
felt at home, for he had married a
Union county young lady, a Miss Hill
daughter of Jas. Hill of Carlisle. Wa.?
running because he wanted the office
and the salary it paid. That in the
past the office of secretary of state
had been given by the secretary to
his chief clerk, and as an example
cited that Thompson was defeated by
Cooper, that when Cooper was worn
Ollt nnH HiH nnf noro >/> ??? ln?~
?. V. .V . ul. ?..jr .iriiRer
he willed the office to his chief
clerk, Gantt; that Gartt in turn willed
the office to his chief clerk, McCown,
and that now as McCown is done, he
is now trying to will it to Dove.
State Treasurer S. T. Carter was
the next speaker, and most of his time
was taken up in defending his record
and his private life, in anticipation of
the assault W. D. McLaurin had in
for him. That he had no war record
to boast about, but that his record as
State treasurer was the best ever
made. That he is criticized on account
of his asking for free tuition at
Winthrop college. That when he
asked for free tuition there, he had
just lost his house by fire; that McLaurin
was criticizing him for owning
an automobile; that he bought one to
take his children into the city to
school; that he had hirfed a negro to
run his automobile was untrue,

sometimes drove it. That in the matter
of refunding the State bonds he
had been able to save the State
$ 200,000, and on another entry had
discovered an error of $28,000 in interest
charges. That he had succeedI
in borrowing money for the State
cheaper than it had ever been bor(Continued

Recently The Times man called upon
the city clerk, Mr. ('has. F. Hart, for
the figures under dispensary and under
no dispensary, and the figures
were taken directly from the court
record. Comment is unnecessary, for
the figures speak for themselves. The
record from January 1. 1915, to August
1, 1015, shows the number of
cases tried for drunkenness. The other
column shows the record for the
first seven months in 1916.

ANNUAL MEETING
Union County Baptist Association to
Be Held With Fairriew Baptist
Church?Begins Wednesday,
Aug. 30?Take
| The forty-fiist annual session of the
Union County Baptist association will
he held with the Fairview church, beginning
Wednesday, August 30, at 10
j o'clock, a. m. There is some conj
fusion as to the time of meeting, owi
ing to an error in the printed minj
utes. Wednesday, Aug. 30, is the
;date settled upon by the executive
I committee.
S Every clerk in the association has
been sent a blank upon which to
make out the report of his church.
The church should then adopt this
letter, elect delegates and alternates,
and the delegates, bringing the letter,
should be on hand at the opening of
the association.
Each appointee to get up a reoort
is likewise urged to be on hand rt '.he
opening session, and to have his report
ready to present upon the tall
cf the body.
Please give attention to these re
quests, for in so doing, the work of
Hie association will he greatly advanced.
Visiting brethren are requested t?>
call upon me at Union, and 1 will
see that free transportation to nd
from the association is furnished. In
this connection, I will say that brethren
owning automobiles will confer a
kindness by offering to help in 'his
matter. Perhaps six or eight such
visiting brethren will attend. It should
be an easy matter to get each one to
and from the church.
A wonderful year of blessing has
been experienced. Many souls have
been brought into the kingdom. Let
us go up to the association with hearts
filled with thanksgiving.
