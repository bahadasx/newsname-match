CHAUTAUQUA OPENS
WEDNESDAY, AUG. 30
Lasts For Seven Days. Big
Musical Attraction Every
Day.
Starting next Wednesday af
ternoon and lasting for the next
week, with a program morning,
afternoon and evening the big
Lexington Chautauqua will be
on. The tent this year will again
be placed on the lot at the
Wentworth academy and from
present indications the attend
ance will be far ahead of last
year. The Vawter people pro
vided us with a much better
program last year than we have
ever before had and the Tenth
Anniversary program this year
promises to be better than last
years. Towns where they have
had the program pronounce this
the best they have had offered
to them, and the Chautauqua
people admit that it cost them
$1000 a week more than last
year to put it on.
Those who help bring the
Chautauqua here should secure
tickets at a cheaper rate than
others. Those who signed can
secure tickets before next Tues
day at $2.00 at J. C. Graddy's
office. ' Those not called for by
that time will be thrown into
the general sale. 800 tickets
was sent here, 715 of which were
signed for leaving only a few
to sell at the $2.00 outside of
the signers and the first to pur
chase will be the ones to save the
fifty cents. Tickets after the
800 are sold and at the gate wil
be $2.50.
Take a program from any of
the stores, check off the num
' bers you would like to hear and
then see if the Season ticket is
not the cheapest plan. The total
single admissions is $6.25 so if
you can attend only a third of
the time the season ticket is
the cheapest.
Those who wish may reserve a
seat for the season Wednesday
at 9 a. m. at Graddy's office, the
opening morning of the Chautauqua.
A Romance of Lexington.
On Saturday, Sept. 9th, 1916,
he Holley Film Producing Com
pany, the largest rum U)., oe-
ween Chicago and Los Angeles,
will "shoot" the various scenes
of "A Romance of . Lexington"
right here in Lexington. The
cast of the play will consist of
Lexington young ladies and gen
tleman, and the leading lady will
be presented with the film after
it has been shown at the Grand
three nights, Sept. 18th, 19th
and 20th. The leading lady will
be chosen by a popular vote
which starts at the Grand Fri
day night of this week. Patrons
will receive a ballot at the door,
and may vote for their choice
by writing her name thereon.
Thus far there are about 16 can
didates, the names of which will
be thrown on the screen Friday
night. This is not an advertis

population of Lexington. Re
member, the voting commences
tomorrow night, Friday, August
25th at the Grand.

nquiries from an Illinois officer
for a "Joe Bailey," wanted for
brgery, gave City Marshal
Owen a clew to Joe's prosperity,
and when the latter was asked
under what name he travelled
in Illinois, he said, "Joe Bailey."
Joe is a bright and attractive
boy and wins the confidence of
people on short acquaintance
He is, however, filled to the
bursting point with cussedness
and has made several efforts
heretofore to break into the
renitentiary.
Mr. Hughes is making many
speeches. He has not in any of
them given evidence of the capa
city for great statesmanship.
The role of a common scold
should at least be supplemented
by some sort of assertiveness of
capacity on his part to do better.
Police Court.
With the approach of dog days,
personal encounters are becom
ing more numerous. The law
has recently gathered in the fol
lowing:
Arthur Johnson, fighting, fined
$5.30. Chas. Peterson, fighting,
fined $5.30. Clarence McFadin
fighting, fined $4.85. Lena Mc

Mr. Bour and Miss Pace were
picked up by another car and
taken to the St. Luke's hospital
in Kansas City. There it was
learned that Miss Pace had sus
tained a slight fracture of the
skull. Mr. Bour was not ser
iously hurt. The car is a com
plete wreck.
An operation was performed
on Miss Pace Sunday night. She
is improving steadily and will
probably be able to return home
at an early day.

er Grocery Company. He was

ing to the company.
The Pageant.
The Pageant given on the Col
lege campus Thursday night was
most satisfactory. The large au
dience was assured beforehand
because of the cr.teem ir. which
the U. D. C. organization is held,
and the prominence of tlvj ladies
who acted as patronesses. The
program, included some very
pretty dancing, varying from
the stately minuet to the aban
don of Spanish rythm. The Rose
dance was one
effects; the solo
all well done, and the introduc
tion of the negro plantation
dance supplied the necessary
humor for a successful program.

"The Yard that Sires and SatisGes,"
Mr. and Mrs. Ed Catron and
son, Ed uatron, Jr., leit rnciay
for Kansas City after a visit
with Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Bar.don
During their stay here Ed, Jr.,
sang at the U. D. C. vaudeville
and at several private informal
gatherings. All who heard him
were delighted at the wonder
tul quality or his voice. He is
eleven years old and has a high
soprano. His voice is sweet,
clear and marvelously true. He
sings long florid cadenzas and al
ways ends in exactly the correct
pitch. Another surprising thing
about his singing is his hand
ling of scales and arpeggios. He
gives each note distinctly with
out a trace of uncertainty. His
stage presence is exceedingly at
tractive, as he is a real natura
boy without a trace of affection
or sell -esteem. ine coming
season Mrs. Catron will coach
him and let him do some concer
work. Undoubtedly with a little
more training and experience
Ed will be one of the foremost
boy sopranos of the country.

Schmelzers scored their first
run in the second on a hit and
two errors. They ran in two
more in the third on three two
base hits. They played errorless
ball behind Dunn, and their
center fielder made some nifty
catches in the outer garder.
The management of the Lex

able trouble and expense to get

of our weakly constituted fans
were kicking because they were
