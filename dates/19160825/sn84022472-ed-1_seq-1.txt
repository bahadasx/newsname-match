Dr. Sophian . believes the normal

on
Washington, Aug. 25 The
railway strike negotiations re
solved themselves today, out
wardly at least, into a more or
less confused state.
" Expressions of .. optimism
from both sides were not so
free as they were yesterday
and feeling heretofore general
among the managers that a
plan to include the" eight-hour
day would be found was not so
evident. Some of the railway
executives reverted to their
prediction that it never would
be conceded. The executives
were to meet the president this
afternoon. 1
President Wilson kept his
cabinet waiting an hour while
he conferred with the four
brotherhood heads, AH parties
to Ahe conference steadfastly
declined to say what was talk
ed about. ,' - '.
- ..The four brotherhood heads said on
entering the White House that they
did not know why they had been;
called by the President;. It was un
derstood President Wilson wanted to
get their views on legislation under
consideration to prevent controversy
in the future. , ,T;'..',"
The four brotherhood heads re
mained with the President an hour'
and a half but would make no state
ment on leaving. President kept the
cabinet waiting for an hour to con
tinue his conference with 'the rail
road men.
"The situation. Insofar as we are
concerned," . A. B. Garretson, spokes
man for the employes, later said, "is ;
absolutely unchanged. . No complete,
concrete proposition to which the rail
roads will agree has been tendeved
us. Our position is exactly the same
as It was when we accepted the Presl-,
dent's plan. We have deviated from
it In no way -whatsoever." j
The brotherhood leaders went from
the White House to report to a meet
ing of the men but insisted they had
nothing particular to communicate.
W. G. - Lee, - of the trainmen, gave
out copies of an order which he said
had been sent by the Northern Pa
cific to. station agents directing them
to get ' local Interests to send tele
graphic protests to President Wilson
against settling the controversy by
other means than arbitration. The
telegrams, Mr. Lee declared, were to
be paid for by the railroad and-were
evidence of what tfhe men character

but was told that all the rooms in
the hotel had been taken and he could
not be accommodated. He then went

told the young' man of his inability
to procure a roein for the night and
his acquaintance said that he could
get a room for him.
In company with the stranger, Fos

up East Main street. At Old Mill
Green, another man apparently un

and walked across the green in com

revolver, cautioned Foster to remain
silent.

over the head with a billy, knpcklng
him unconscious. After rifling his
pockets they left him on the ground,
taking with them Foster's cash, of $36
and his watch. v, in crossing the park
they dropped the watch and it was

xne situation which has become
tense in this city owinsr to allesred out

tors resulted in a vote of the associa
tion iDeing taken to ask for injunction
proceedings against outside interests
Before application was made to the
superior court Mayor Wilson consent
ed to 'hear the grievances of the or
ganization against what is termed
"Inadequate police protection." '
As outlined by Louis Aldo, a well
known vegetable grower of this ity.
superintendent of the market on, lot
qwneflTSy the New York. New Haven
&; Hartford railroad at the corner of
wall and Water streets, the situation
is this:
The situation attempted over a year
ago to establish market- places for
gardeners in Bridgeport Several lots
were laid aside for the purpose. On
the opening day only one peddler put
in an appearance to sell his produce.
From all sections of Fairfield coun
ty farmers and truckmen have come
to Bridgeport during the early morn
ing hours and in many instances their
teams have been a source of traffic
obstruction on Main street and else
where. '. u
It was recently proposed by the
mayor that if the farmers would
form an association and hire a lot
they would be given police protection.
The proposition was accepted and the
lot taken from the New Haven road
at an expense of about $125 per
month. . Members, now numbering
more than 4 5 were required to pay
6 per annum or 50 cents for every
team driven on the lot. , The officers
of the alliance are Herbert SnifTin,
Stratford,' president; T. W. Ryan,
Stratford, treasurer; H. P. Beers,
Fairfield, secretary. '- Other promin
ent farmers from Bridgeport and the
surrounding towns belonging to the
organization are Arnold Hull, Edward
Pease, Fred sennings, Howard Martin,
George B. Wheeler, W. A. Bulkley,
Arthur W. Taylor, Fred K'. Wilcox,
William Dorsey, J. Lqbdell, Charles
Kane, Michael Rabstock, J. W. Ward.
The plan worked extremely well.
The only restriction was that each
vendor must be an actual producer. It
is alleged that when the scheme was
found to be successful, a coterie of lo
cal peddlers, strong in votes, came
upon the lot. . When it was found
that they were merely speculating,
thefr fees were refused and they were
asked to vacate the premises.
This they refused to do, and it Is
said by the association officers that
police privilege was given them to
hawk from their carts in front of
the property In violation of the ordin
ances and against the express prom
ise of Mayor Wilson.
Several minor fights have marked
the discord which today resulted in
conference with an attorney looking
towards the application for an in
junction restraining the opposition
from peddling goods in front of the
premises hired by the association. This
step was postponed upon the arrange
ment of a meeting with the city om-
clals.
The police version of the affair, as
outlined by Lieut. Wheeler, is to the
offoot that, tha association members
have attempted to restrict trade by
formulating big prices for the pro
duct which speculators can truck from
New Haven an! sell cheaper.
This statement In turn Is offset by
explanation that the cheaper goods
are also cheaper In quality.
