• HEALTH INSURANCE
COMING IN CANADA
The National Liberal party of Can
ada, lee by Sir Wilfrid Laurier, has
adopted a pi ink for compulsory health
insurance of wage earners, maternity
benefits to be included, as part of its
program for the election following the
conclusion of the war. leading Can
adian newspapers anticipate that in
order to retain its popularity the Con
k servative party will adopt a similar
progressive program of Bocial legis
lation. It is expected, therefore, that
health insurance laws will be enacted
In Canada in the early days of re
construction.
Compulsory health Insurance of i
wage earners based on Joint contribu
tions from the state, employers and
employes has been establslhed in
Germany, Austria Hungary. Russia,
Great Hritain, Holland and Norway,
Roumania and Serbia. In most of
these countries both cash and medical
benefits are provided for the insured
workers, and effective campaigns for
the prevention of sickness have be
come general.

HEALTH INS .RANGE
PREVENTIO NS OF DISEASE
SAYS SAIiE FOUNDATION
The Russell Foundation has
Just published a report following an
exhaustive study of industrial condi
tions in Springfield, Illinois. The re
port states:
"There still remains a large amount
Of occupational sickness which falls
as a disproportionately heavy eco
nomic and physical burden upon the
shoulders of the worker. It should
not be his loss, but rheirH-n* "tsmn jj
shared by the industry QUI the public.
A method to this end is found in
health insurance. It is believed,
moreover, as in the case of workmen's
compensation laws, that health in
surance legislation will act as a pow
erful force for the development of
measures for the prevention of
disease."

ment in Regard to Hajry

New York, Aug. 11, 1916.
To the Officers and Delegates of the
Central Labor Union.
Greeting:
The Actors' International Union, an
organization of theatrical performers
affiliated with the American Federa
tion of Labor for over sixteen years
previous to the amalgamation with
the White Rats of America, an inde
pendent theatrical association, submit
the inclosed circular for the informa
tion and guidance of your body in any
conferences you may hold with the
representatives of the White Rats
Actors' Union of America.
We would refer your central body to
the New York Central Federated
Union, who have upheld the reputa
tion and standing of the Actors' Inter
national Union since the violation of
all agreements with the former White
Rats, the American Federation of
Labor through its president and other
national officers have been engaged
in trying to regulate the situation in
so far as trying to reorganize and
create a real actors' organization, af
filiated to the American Federation of
Labor, conferences have been held,
but of no avail, as those in charge of
the destinies of the White Rats are
only interested in trying to create
funds lo save a foolish investment of
all the funds of that order in a club
house situated in New York City,
which investment is a proven criminal
transaction.
The Actors' International Pnion
refuse to further confer with the
White Rats Actors' Union for the
purpose of creating an entire new
national organization for the reason
that the White Rats refuse to allow
any person but their international sec
retary to speak and act for them.
While he was with us in our fight for
justice for over four years, we have
found at this time that he is of the
class of men that should not be en
titled to the respect and confidence
of the wage earners of this country.
We hold the inclosed proofs of his
digression from the straight and hon
orable path of trades unionism, and
while we are willing to meet at any
time or place at the direction of the
A. F. of L. any person or persons who
are working to bring about an under
standing that will assist the theatrical
performers of this country, we refuse
to do any further business with one,
Harry Mountford, a creator of de
structive organizations for pay.
We ask that you demand of the
White Rats Actors' Union and Harry
Mountford the proofs that he is not
guilty, as charged, failing to do so*
that your honorable body refuse to
transact any business with any ocm
mittee thai of which he may be a part.
Respectfully and fraternally yours,
HARRY DE VEAUX, President.

THE OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE
£>EVOTED TO THE INTEREST
EVERETT, WASH., FRIDAY, AUGUST 25, 1916
TRADES
COUNCIL
NEWS
SPECIAL MEETING
Claiming that the police and sheriff
departments exercised undue dis
crimination in recent strike trouble,
particularly the trouble between the
shingle weavers at the Cargo mill
last Saturday, the Centra) Labor
Council held a meeting last Monday
night and completed details for a mass
meeting of organized labor last night
at City Park.
Feeling against the authorities ran
high during the meeting and in
answer to the check of $25 presented
the Shingle Weavers' Union by Sheriff
Mcßae at the beginning of the present
strike the members of the Labor
Council raised a subscription of $34,
of which sum $25 will be returned to
the sheriff in answer to the check. A
committee was appointed to visit local
unions with a view of levying an as
sessment of 25 cents per day against
union men to assist in maintaining
the shingle weavers' strike.
The following resolution was
adopted:
"To the General Public of Everett:
"Whereas, the organized workers
are being discriminated against by
the authorities of the City of Everett
and the sheriffs office of Snohomish
County, by openly winking at violence
on the part of imported strikebreakers
and professional thugs, but deny the
striking workmen the same protec
tion afforded the strikebreakers, and
"Whereas, organized labor only de
sires to exercise our constitutional
rights and be accorded the protection
that the law allows, therefore be it
"Resolved, That we inform the of
ficial of Everett, Snohomish County
and the State of Washington, that we
insist on our constitutional rights; be
it further
"Resolved, That we condemn the
actions of the Everett police depart
ment and the sheriff's office of Sno
homish County for imprisoning union
men for simply refusing to leave the
city; be it further
"Resolved. That organized labor call
a mass meeting at the City Park.
Thursday, August 24, to enlighten
the general public as to the real con
ditions that exist on the waterfront.

INSTRUCTION OF
ALIENS URGED
Steps Are Taken to Educate
European Immigrants at
Washington, D. C.
Washington, D. C, Aug. 20.—Great
ly increased school facilities are to
be provided this fall for the instruc
tion of foreign-born residents of the
United States, and especially for alien
candidates for citizenship. During the
last scholastic year the public school
authorities of approximately 650 cities
and towns in 44 states of the Union
were co-operating with the Bureau of
Naturalization of the U. S. Depart
mentof Labor in this branch of its
educational activity. According to in
formation thus far received by the
bureau, nearly 100 others have sig
nified their intention of joining in the
movement, and all indications now
point to a most gratifying record for
the 1916-17 school year.
It is the aesire of the Bureau of
Naturalization that public school night
classes be installed wherever the need
exists for the education and Ameri
canization of foreigners. This field of
operation of the public schools is not
limited to these who have applied for
naturalization. It is intended to in
clude all foreign-born residents whose
instruction in English and civics
would, beyond question result not
only in great personal benefit to
themselves, but would be of signal
advantage to the city in which they
reside and, logically, to the nation as
well.
That the cost of the establishment
and maintenance of such schools is
relatively small as compared with (he
great good accomplished, is con
vincingly shown by reports received
from the public school authorities who
co-operated with the Bureau of Natu
ralization last year. With this in
view, the bureau is urging the super
intendents of schools all over the
country to insert in their municipal
budget for next year an item provid
ing funds to cover the expense of
carrying on this public night school
work.
LABOR FIGHTS
FOR THE REPEAL OF
ANCIENT BLUE LAW
Newark, N. J.—The Essex Trades
Council has begun a campaign to se
cure the abilition of the vice and im
morality law of 1797, known as one of
the blue laws, on the ground that it
was not only barbarous and an
tiquated, but defeats the ends for
whirh it was framed, and more en
courages than prevents crime. The
council's committee on political action
isaiow handling the matter.
Under the act referred to it is crim
inal for boys to play a baseball game
on Sunday in the city parks. Orches
tra concerts in a hall are illegal.
Theatres must remain closed.
It is pointed out by the labor men
that the old statute works havoc, es
pecially among the youth. Denied the
right to vent their energies in a game
of ball or by other contests and sports
in the municipal parks and squares,
hoys, it is shown, will frequently go
into some alley and shoot "craps."
The campaign to have the musty
statute repealed will be carried on
during the fall election with great
vigor.

SOME OF THE FACTS OF THE
WEAVERS RECENT TROUBLE
A LITTLE BIT OF THE OTHER SIDE THAT WAS NOT
PRINTED IN OUR DAILY PAPERS
Fair-minded men realize that the
truth of incidents in controversy as
between Capital and Labor can only
be arrived at by impartially consider
ing the presentations of special advo
cates, who, on the side of I-at)or, may
be influenced by zeal, and on the side
of Capital, too frequently by gold.
The daily press, the most powerful
medium of appeal to the public, has
its principal pecuniary resource in
the field of advertisers, but its
columns are also at the disposal of
industrial barons and politicians de
voted to the interests of industrial
barons.
II perhaps will not be questioned
that the function of the daily press is
to present, among other things, views
favorable to Capital and that facts
just to Labor, must necessarily be
sought in the Labor journals.
On the waterfront, where shingle
weavers have been engaged in picket
ing struck mills, violence has made
its appearance. The strike is months
old, but the initial instance of vio
lence occurred Saturday morning. A
picket line of seventeen men, no one
of whom had conducted himself in a
manner to have undergone arrest dur
ing all the period of the strike, were
beaten up by assailants numbering at
least seventy men, directed by Mr.
Jamison, inspired by Mr. Downs, and
led by thugs especially imported for
the occasion. The daily press has re
ported the affair in an aspect dis
creditable to Labor, withal expressing
its total inability to surmise who was
the agrressor in a melee in which
seventeen men were on one side and
seventq on the other.
The pickets beaten up were sta
tioned in a public thoroughfare, and,
according to fourth of July orations,
at least, were clothed in all the rights
of American citizens.
The owners of the strike-bound
mills of Everett exercise such rights
and would protect themselves, or be
protected in them, could any maniac
be found to question the matter in the
least.
The fact is that the owners involved
do go about the public thoroughfares,
without the slightest danger to them
selves, In the pursuit of their ordinary
business. That business may be at
a*
times to persuade non-union men to
accept positions vacated by union men
because of a strike; it may be, and
often is, to persuade efficient work
men to leave a competitor for their
own service.
The owners of whom we speak go
about singly, or in groups, and in
what hour of the day or night they
please. They may accost, interrogate
or bargain with men happening to be
strangers to them. No unionist could
be found to assert that their right to
do these things infringed upon any
right he claimed for himself, and a
suggestion that they should be
clubbed, shot and jailed for so oing
could emanate nowhere in the uni
verse but from characters 01 the
stamp of Francisco Villa.
Now. the question is fair; Whj nave
not other citizens who happen o be
union pickets the same ri; in pur
suing their business, whi' | ay be
that of asking workers gt i. less
than the union scale to demat .1 the
union scale; of asking recah itrant
union men to remain union ir. a; of
accosting, it may be, stranger con
cerning their intention or not inten
tion of accepting employment t less
than prevails in SO per cent >f the
shingle mills in the State of Wash
ington?
The reply to these questions would
almost certainly be that the workers
have such rights and that the very
fact that an anti-picketing law Is be
fore the voters proves that now. at
least, the right is unquestioned.
What ~i tloned is that the
picket should ever, e\ though stand
ing on public property, go near the
premises of a struck plant Instead of
staying up town and on the street
The proposition can be retorted. Why
should the millman come up on the
street instead of staying down at his
mill? The answer is simply that the
In Organization
Lies the Hope
of Labor
|tnillman works the street because that
is the best place to get recruits for
his side, and the picket works the mill
frontage because there he can do
most for his side. An injunction pro
hibiting the employer from getting re
cruits when and where he could, other
than at his own office, would be as
fatal in its effect on his interests as
an injunction preventing pickets from
seeing strike-breakers at their work
(the only place where they can be
seen), would be fatal to unionism.
Such an injunction issued to the em
ployer would be a recognition of
property rights and the worker in the
first case cited could with quite as.
much logic apply for that injunction
as his human right, if human rights
were much contemplated in the great
body of law.
The right is one that union men
must use sparingly or risk being
beaten up by overwhelming forces of
strike breakers urged on by the direc
tion of their boss and in the knowl
edge that armed thugs stand ready to
effectually second their efforts with
bullets and bludgeons.
The action of the police in the Sat
urday morning occurrence will be al
most unbearable by those whose com
posite of the police character has
been gathered by watching them on
street crossings or holiday parades.
Thai a striker could he beaten help
less and be dragged to the edge of a
bluff to be thrown over it. being
saved only by the protest of one of
those who had aided in the beating,
that such an incident could occur in
full view of the police without them
making a move to stop it. cannot
easily be believed, but can readily be
proved.
Policemen may and occasionally do
make an effort in such contingencies
to protect helpless pickets, who al
ways lie under the aspersion, what
ever may happen, of causing trouble,
but in this instance of seventeen men
being beaten up (a rather wholesale
affair it w ill be admitted I, no such
human impulse inspired ttie consti
tuted authorities. Instead, they settled
themselves into a soft and delicious
freedom from Hieing care and enjoy
ing the spectacle so hugely as to de
mand an encore, offered as a slight
testimonial of their appreciation of
this charming pleasantry that they
had done nothing to prevent seven
teen being beaten by seventy because
the line marking the city limits had
presented itself as quite beyond their
powers of sultation, however unob
structive it had proved to their vision.
When, however, on the nearly same
ground, festivities of the same kind
were resumed in the evening with
happier success for the pickets, the
police flew to the assistance of those
who had so lavishly dispensed pun
ishment but ten hours before, firing
several shots, finally shooting a
striker in the hip and thus indicated
the intention to kill.
The emplo\ ment of force la at all
times deplorable—such, at least, is the
verdict of Labor, which, down all the
aget, speaks through having suffered.
And such is the verdict of Capital,
though it Is singular that a thing so
deplorable should so often be called
to its service.
The picket line of the shingle
weavers was beaten up at the com
mand of employers who are assuredly
honorable men condemning violence
except when it is administered by
their order and to their advantages.
The armored knight of the feudal ages
made a "kultur" of k'lling ragged
peasants fighting with oak staves.
When gunpowder was invented and
all the armor was junked because of
the slight resistance it offered to
bullets, the virtue of force rose in
the estimation of the peasant as it
fell in the appreciation of the taßßeled
noble.
The sole proposition of Col. Hartley,
that on which he bases his candidacy
for governor, is the long-felt need of
force to stifle the spirit of Labor; that
the gunman of the private employer
Bhould be superseded by the cossack
