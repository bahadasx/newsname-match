A STUDENT JOXE.
Conspiracy of Silence That Put
th
Professor in a Panic.
Professor E'ia Lo.nnis for mar
years occupied the chair oi' astron
my at Yale and was the author
the well known scries oC ma-themn
ical text books.
Professor Loomia repeated enci
year to the junior class a course o
lectures on physics. The lecture
were illustrated by expo rime nl
and in one on compressed air li
explained the principle of the vre!
known air gun.
The students of each succeeding 1
class as they entered the room fo?
this particular lecture found on tin
side of the room remote from tin
platform a small targe L After ex

of landing three of its pro joc tile.
with mathematical accuracy in thr
center of the bullseye.
The professor was always ap
plauded for this feat, but his grim
face, covered by a tightlv dr:v-.vn
skin of parchment hue, never show
ed the slightest sign of gratification
or recognition of any kind. To him
it was apparently only a scientific
experiment to be exactly demon
strated. One class of juniors, however,
who had learned of the immemorial
incident from the then seniors, at
tempted a little experiment of
their own, the subject being mathe
matical and scientific human na
ture. Three pufTs from the air gun, and,
although the students saw that the
bullseye was perforated as usual.
there "was not a sound of applause.
Professor Loomis looked a moment
at the el as in a startled way, then
at the target, mid then, with a de
gree of emotiua he had never be
fore shown, exclaimed:
"Didn't It l it? Didirt it hit? ';

A ruar t.f laughter, followed by
even more 'torn the usual applause,
showed she pro fervor that he had

Chinese Worship cf Ancestors.
The one spiritual force that dom
inates every class of society in Chi
na is ancestor worship. In the Chi
nese religion there is no other that
can take its place for a moment. A
man may or may not worship idols.
He may express his utter skeptic
ism about them or profess belief in
them. iSo one cares what he
thinks. Let him, however, neglect
the worship of the dead and he if
looked upon and pointed to with
the bittereit scorn both by his own
relations and by his neighbors. The
worst taunr that the heathen can
hurl against the Christian, and the
one that sung. him most, is the
sneering statement that he has no
ancestors. Xew York Tribune.

and only ten pounds of that ration are

put it iu their own pockets."
The foregoing statement appears in
a bulletin w.hlch the Department of Ag
riculture has just Issued reviewing the
progress of the beet sugar Industry
during the past year. The report pro
ceeds to point out that whHe the pro
duction of sugar from beets has ad
vanced very rapidly, more than 5,000,
000 tons of beets having been grown
last season. 2.000,1)00 acres additional
should bo devoted lo this crop in or
der to produce ai home the sugar now
purchased from abroad.
This is a subject of particular In
terest to Indiana for the reason that
this state lies in the center of one of
the most important beet sugar produc
ing sections of the country. Not only
have repeated tests in sugar beet
growing demonstrated that Indiana
soil is adapted to the production of
this valuable crop, but the successful
peration during the past season of
the state's first beet sugar factory has
proved It conclusively. Although the
. season was an unfavorable one and

A CR0QKED BOUNDARY.
Cause of the Peculiar Lines That DU
vide Two States.
If you will look on the map of
New England you will see two cu
rious irregularities in the dividing
line between Massachusetts and
Connecticut. One of them is in
Granby township, a little north
west of Hartford, and the other in
Enfield township, on the Connecti
cut river, south of Springfield. It
is a standing conundrum why, so
long as the boundary is imaginary,
they did not make it straight in
stead of crooked. But thereby
hangs a tale.
Those two little jogs on the rna.p
are monuments to human obstinacy
and to the persistency which is one
of the chief traits of the 1 Yankee
character. The ancestors of the
farmers who own those little spots
of ground preferred to live in iüas-
Baenusetn rather thai in Connecti
cut and fouiht for their preferei.ve
until they had their way.
The controversy be-ran in 1713
and continued for 'l oars before
it was final1;. ,Uv,dci In 1724 tl. i
question a- app-Jed to England,
but the government was so much
engrossed in the Seven Tears' war
that it was never brought to the at
tention of the crown. Up to the
outbreak of tho Eevolufcion both
states continued to levy taxes and
send notices of fast dars and elec
tions to the farmers who occupied
xthe land, and there is no record of
how thev avoided one or whether
they paid both. Later, however,
they voted- and paid taxes in Massa
chusetts only, notwithstanding the
protest of the county authorities in
Connecticut. In 1793, after peace
was restored, both states appointed
, commissioners, but the dispute wa
carried on until 1804, when a coui-
promise was reached. There were
several similar dispntes between tho
two states besides those which now
appear npon.the map, and an agree
ment was reached by which Massa-
claim to a strip of territory in
Woodstock and Suffield townships,
provided Connecticut would )ield
ner claims to the other tracts in
dispute. Xo action, however, was
taen upon the report.
In 1810 the controversy was re
vived by some legal proceeding, and
another commission was appointed,
but if it ever reached a conclusion
there is no record, to be found. In
1820 a third commission was in
trusted with the settlement, . and
after two years they decided npon
the, present boundary line, which
was adopted by the legislature of
both etates.' Exchange.
