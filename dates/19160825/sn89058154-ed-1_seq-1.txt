The labor question is again
menacing business as well as the
much desired tranquility of the
country. The small labor unions
are all feverish on account of the
threatened railroad strike, which
has obtained national recognition,
When prosperity comes to busi
ness, labor becomes restless and
proposes to assert its power.
Capital can do without labor bet
ter than labor can do without
capital. Both rely on the public,
. and the public are affected most
of all. They are the sufferers,
and have no financial interest in
either. ' Capital can stop and not
pay a board bill. Labor must
eat or starve. The great menace
to government is that of conflict
between capital and labor. It
will, unless settled by legislative
enactment in time, result in re
bellion and national conflict. All
thinking people, either as capi
talists or laboring men, should
consider well the fatal conse
quences of their act.
Horrible Catastrophe
Monday morning at 7 :10 the three
boilers exploded in the extensive
stave mill situated near the M. & 0.
and N. C. & St. L. crossing, in South
Jackson. Eight persons were killed
and some fifteen injured. Four of
those killed were white men, and four
negroes. One of the white men
killed, Pope Smallwood, is from the
Smallwood family of McNairy.
The explosion shook the city.
Some were struck by flying fragments,
over 100 yards from the building.
The property loss was between 15
and 20 thousand dollars. The estab
lishment was owned by Harlan &
Morris, and will be rebuilt.
No cause is assigned for the ex
plosion.
Unadulterated Cussedness
While' W. K. Abernathy, J.,A.
Houston and Geo. Prather were re
turning Monday night from Bolivar,
where they had taken a patient,
about 10 o'clock, whiie passim near
a house, some one threw a rock or
piece of brick, striking Mr. Abernathy
on the forehead, cutting a gash an
inch long. It is supposed it was done
by a lot of boys near the house and
juat for puro cussedness, as it was
dark and they could haye had nothing
against the party, or known only that
it was a passing auto.

"work we fail to understand. " We
heartily endorse the plan of the' Sel

deed the public should know it. If

THIS LITTLE WOMAN
GAINS 35 POUNDS
Oh Child of Mine!
By E. P.
I called thee forth, oh Child of
Mine, into a strange world without
thine own consent.
I made thee what thou art. All
along my path of life I have gathered
thoughts, passions, and ideals, of
which tby soul is made.' I gave thee
thy measure of health and strength.
Thy home and thy friends I made for
thee, and through them-1 stamped
indellible impressions upon thy soul.
When thou was yet uncreated I chose
thy father for thee. I have cast
around thee influences the effects of
which thou canst never overcome,
even shouldst thou remain in the
world beyond man's allotted three
score years and ten.
Dost thy path in life lead up above
the clouds into realms of eternal
light? I directed thy course for thee
when thou wast too young to choose.
Art thou traveling down in the
shadows and the mire? I directed
thy course for thee when thou wast
too young to choose. . S
Hast thou gathered fruit from the
Trees Immortal? I directed thy
choice and instructed thee what
things to gather in life. Is ihy soul
famishishing upon the ashes of the
Dead Sea apples that thou in thy
folly hast gathered, neglecting that
which is food to thy immortal self?
I directed thy choice and instructed
thee what things to gather in life.
I made thee what thou art, oh
Child of Mine..
Upon my bended knee I plead that
thou wilt forgive me for every weak
ness I have forced upon, thee either
by inheritance or training. Forgive
me for every mistake of thy life and
for everr blot upon thy soul.
I made thee what thou art.

"Honestly, I am getting so fat I
am really ashamed to tell how much
I have gained," said. Mrs. Hettie Mc-
Garr, who lives at 1806 Eighteenth
Avenue, North, Nashville, Tenn., sev
eral days ago.
"Actually, it has gotten to be a
regular joke, for I have gotten so
stout that my clothes are too small
for me, and every dress I wore last
winter will have to be made over
again," she continued, "and the change
in my general appearance is so won
derful that my friends and neighbors
are all wondering what I have been
doing with myself. When they ask
me I just tell them I have been tak
ing Tanlac, and it is a fact, for I have
just finished my third bottle, and have
gained 35 pounds.
"When I began taking the medi
cine I only weighed 105 pounds and
now I weigh 140, and never felt
better in my life.
"I always enjoyed very good health
up to about two years ago, when I
began having indigestion, which grad
ually developed into a bad form of
stomach trouble. This trouble began
pulling me down and I finally got so
I could not eat anything at all scarcely,
and had to diet myself continually.
I had to avoid sweets of all kinds and
always after eating I would suffer for
hours.
"I was also very nervous and dizzy
and very easily tired. I finally got so
weak I could not walk any distance
without resting. My kidneys must
have been affected also, for I had
severe pains in my sides and back.
"My sister, Mrs. Minnie Hall, came
to see me one day and she looked so
well I asked her what she had been
taking. She told me Tanlac. and I
made up my mind right then and
there to give it a trial,
"Acting on her advice, I bought a
bottle and have been taking it regu
larly since Of course I expected it
to help me, but if anyone bad told
me that there was a medicine on
earth that would help me like Tanlac
I would not have believed them.
"The medicine seemed to be just
the one thing I needed, for it just
filled me with new life and energy
from the very first dose. In only a
few more days my appetite returned
and I began to enjoy my meals and
everything seemed to agree with me
and nourish me. , ,x
VI am no longer nervous, and dizzy
headed like I was and can now sleep
like a child. . In fact, I feel just like
a person who had been made all over
again. I hope every suffering woman
will hear about it."

."' Uuck Snort
Tells How to Eat a Watermelon
CROSSWAYS! Then I knowed he
was a blue-belly, fer nobody but a
Yankee would do anything like that.
Now, the true Tennesaeean cuts his
melon just like the Lord made em to
cut lenthwise, along the stripes and
streaks He put on em fer that pur
pose, and fer us to fuller. There has
to be half a melon fer each one of
the eaters.
First be shore yer melon is good
and ripe, but not too ripe. Pull it
when the querl or pig-tail on the
stem jest begins to turn brown, and
the belly of the melon, whur it lies on
the ground, is a-turnin pale. Put it
on a table, press it with yer hand and
hofd yer ear to the side of the melon;
if she goes "crack-crack" inside when
ye press, she's all hunk, and ye roll
er into the-epring or hang er in the
well, until noon next day. Then,
when she's good and cold, take yer
big butcher knife, , start, in at the
blospom end, and cut right through
It's so all-fired, tarnation hot now
adays that I don't feel like writin
verses, and will have to do my com
posing in plain every-day talk this
time. Anyway, its about watermel
ons I'm a-thinkla now, and its al
mighty hard to git a rime fer that
word or to find anything just as
good as the thing itself, these hot
days. .
Watermelons is mighty like some
people: proraiain on the outside and
doubtful inside; look all right till ye
test em, and then sometime the best
looking of em will fool ye. They're
like raflle tickets and wimmen ye've
got to take a chance on em.
Taint everybody knows how to eat
a watermelon. A wise-lookin feller
oome to our house one time and axed
me in sell him one. I hauled a big
striped rattlesnake melon out of the
spring and let him have it fer a dime.
He axed me if I wouldnt let him have
two like it fer fifteen cents. Than I
up and axed him if ho wasnt a Yankee,
and he said he reckoned he was, bein
from Vermont. Then he took a knife
and cut that melon into "slices
the middle, lenthwise to the stem
end. The rine ought to pop open a
little ahead of the knife as ye per
ceed, and the inside ought to be as
red as a rose.
Now, take yer knife, cut out the
heart in big chunks and give to yer
best girl (or wife) or yer favorite
neighbor; then knock out all the
seeds ye can, take yer knife and
scrape the meat into juicy stuff clear
to the white of the rine. cut a notch
to drink out of at one end, tilt np
yer melon, open yer mouth, shet yer
eyes, and jest drink in that cold,
sweet, refreshin, comfortin juice till
ye can't hold no more. Drink it
down with thankfulness, and with a
wish that every man, woman and
child (including all of yer enemies ex
cept melon thieve?) might enjoy the
same blessin. That's what melons
was made fer, and any body that
takes em any other way aint a-foller-in
the plain instructions of natur and
the rules and regulations in sech
cases made and- pervided.

of some teachers to ignore teachers' meetings, but it is imperative that we take
more interest in our public educational gatherings. We hope to have all the

CRIMSON CLOVER SEED STRIPPER
WORKED SUCCESSFULLY THIS YEAR
Ti.
09QSS SeCW 7WWS
Many home-made crimson clover seed ttrlppert like the one here dia
grammed were made In Tennessee thla summer 4nd teed collected by them
will be sown this month of August. -
(By J. C. McAmig, Division of Exten
sion, University of Tennessee.)
The crimson clover seed stripper
ha been a success this season. It
has always worked successfully where
conditions were favorable to Us use.
For the stripper to work smoothly
the clover must be almost free from
weeds. The comb-like teeth are easily
clogged by green weeds. Qreeu clover
leaves have the same effect, up It is
necessary to defer the stripping until
practically all of the clover leaves are
dtad. Then they are easily stripped
from the stem.
A stripper that can be built at home
Is described In Farmers Bulletin No.
646, which may be secured from the
United States Department of Agricul
ture, Washington, D. C. The stripper
described has met the approval of
Tennessee farmers who have tried It
I followed the descriptions and draw
ings given in this bulletin and built a
machine at a cost considerably less
than 15.00. It took me a day to do the
work.
With this machine I found, it possi
ble to strip approximately two acres
a day. It took two men and a horse
to operate the machine.
Crimson clover yields from 6 to 10
bushels per acre. More or less seed
U wasted, by being on the ground.
Even with the necessary loss one
should secure at least as much as S
to 7 bushels of seed per acre.
The stripper removes the seed from
the stem. The seed la still in the
bur, and must either be hulled by a
machine or sown in tho bur. There la
some dlfliculty in seeding in the bur,
though numerous instances show that
it can be done successfully by mix
ing it with pulverized soli or some
other material to prevent the burs
from sticking together. Care should
be taken to scatter the seed uniform
ly when this method of sowing is used.
It would seem that better stands of
clover are secured when unhulled seed
la sown. A bushel of well-packed hulls
contain from 1V4 to 2 pounds of Bead.
By weight it has been estimated that
50 to 60 per cent of unshellcd material
is seed. This method of producing
seed is not ideal for commercial pur
poses, but It is certainly practical t-jt
those of us who are interested in
merely growing seed for home use and
having some to spare tor neighbors.
When we begin to produce our own
seed on our own farms there will be
little purchasing of seed. There will
be no call for money at a season when
that, article Is particularly scarce with
some of us. The result will be an
