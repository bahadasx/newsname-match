WASHINGTON, D. C, A u a. 25. In
dications that the railroad executive
aa a whole may not accept the plan
which their select committee seemed
disposed to aorta upon makes the rail
road strike situation of distinctly
darker outlook today.
Expressions from those closely In
v touch with the developments are not
v as optimistic today aa yesterday. It
Is felt that a more aerloua turn of af
fairs Is likely to come at almost any
time. ; '
All . parties concerned refused to
filve out Information today . but the
gravity of the situation la known.
President Wilson heard from, both
Sides this morning, various delegations
visiting him at the White House. He
was kept so long In conference that
. the cabinet waited an hour after the
. time set for a meeting. . Then the
president and hie official family were
V closeted for some time..
The .opinion, prevaila. In Informed
- circles today that the railroad execu
. -tives will not concede the. eight-hour
. day demanded by-lhe men " '-i i
. -The president's .plan: In some of its
' . .-.'Mpecta had been approved by the con
ference of this select committee ot rail
. road heads, but others of them found
weak points In the proposals made by
the chief executive. Taey pointed out
last night that, while the final decision
has been postponed, the feeling Is that
- some parts of the president's-plan are
- Impracticable. They asserted that the
proposal to increase freight rates, in
order to meet the added demands upon
" the lines, caused by the introduction
of the eight hour day will be extreme
ly difficult to carry into effect.
Commission's Action Problem.
U Is Impossible, they declared, to
tell what the Interstate commerce com-
jjmlsslon will do with the Question ol
increased rates, when It is submitted
"f to that body ETen should the commis
slon decide to allow the proposed in
': creases, the new rates could not go in
N to effect before next March, by which
time it is possible that another ad
ministration will be in power, and one
which, It Is . pointed out, may be an-
tagonlstic to the pl&n of settlement
proposed by the" present authorities.
The attitude of the big shippers
throughout the country Is also having
Its effect upon the railroad heads. The
suggestion that the roads be allowed
to recoup themselves by raising their
fates has drawn scores of protests
from ail parts of the . country and
y: from all classes of shippers.
. The shippers declare that the inter
tiate commerce commission has re
peatedly refused to permit any in
'crease of rates, as asked by thfe rail
roads, and that the business of the
country will not bear the additional
load such an increase would mean.

McCandless Says Supreme
Court Decision Wilt Have No
;- Effect on Movement
Although the supreme court has up
held the validity of the frontage tax
aw so far as It relates to proposed
road work in Manoa Valley, Lincoln
Lv ("Link") McCandless declares that
there will be no let-up in the move
ment to secure signers to a petition
protesting against the application of
this statute to contemplated road im
provements on Beretania street 7
As announced In the Star-Bulletin
( Thursday, P. L. Weaver, attorney for
McCandless,-Is endeavoring to secure
the signatures of at least 55 per cent
of the property owners on that por
tion of the street intended to be im
proved. "Thes signatures are affixed
to- a protest contending that the im
provement work should not be done
under the frontage tax law, but that
the money should come out of the
general taxes. j
"The finding of the supreme court
wlth regard to the proposed Manoa
improvements will have no effect on
our plans, McCandless says. "The
fact that the supreme court holds that
a bond issuance would be valid does
not make any change In the laws per
taining to the rights of the people to
reject a proposal of the board of sup
ervisors to make improvements on any
one street under the frontage tax law.
The supreme court ruling does not
deny citizens the right to protest
against the carrying-out of the front
tage tax law in districts to which it
applies.
"Take Beretania street from Nuu
anu to King as an example. If 55 per

Manoa bonds are not a good Invest

the work Is completed, or nearly so,

Admiralty Repeats, Claim; Ad
mits Westfalen Damaged
By British
The following cablegram from offi
cial German sources, was received to
day: .
"German Admiralty, Report, Aug. 23.
"The British admiralty stated that
the German, report was incorrect ac
cording to which a British battleship
was damaged on August 19 by a Ger
man submarine. On the basis of a
report now arrived It is hereby stated
that the submarine, on the" evening of
August 19, at twilight, encountered a
British squadron ' composed of a bat
tleship and armored , cruisers, sur
rounded by a large number of small
cruisers and destroyers.
"The; submarine succeeded in fir
ing a torpedo against the battleship.
The submarine at this action was
running half flooded (submerged)
with three officers on the bridge Aft
er the torpedo hit a fire column 20
meters across and 40 meters high rose
t the rear smokestack of the last
battleship. The stack was white hot
n the fire column, which lasted about
one minute. .
Simultaneously there was a violent
eruption of the boilers from steam.
After the disappearance of the fire
column only ithe hull c the ship
j without the stacks and masts was j
jseen, while of a neighboring ship the
whole silhouette was visible.
"The commander of the submarine
received the impression that the tor
pedo caused a large oil conflagration
and also heavy damage to .the boil
ers. "The above mentioned facts were
observed by all cheers, which ta
proof that the British battleship was
at least leavily damaged by the at
tack. -
v "The British admiralty's report of
August 22 is correct as far as the
Westfalen being hit by the first tor
pedo. It. was not heavily., damaged
and was able to fight and maneuver.
The Westfalen in a short time wll
be completely repared. The second
of the enemy torpedoes sent aganst
