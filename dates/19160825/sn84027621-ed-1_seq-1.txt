Marion County Pig Club N
Boys The first shipment " of the Hamp
shire pigs for the boys' pig clubs ,of
the county wlu aoivSnext . wek and
the week after from Indiana and Il
linois. The shipment will constitute
two carloads and each will come in
charge of a herdsman. The pigs are
all gilts, pure blooded and bred to
registered males. The lot cost $2440,
delivered at Ocala, and Mr. Black
lock, the county demonstration agent,
is justly proud of the good and quick
work done by the clubs. He says the
pigs and their, increase in twelve
months will be easily worth $10,000.
This good work has been made possi
ble largely by the aid of the banks of
the county, who financed the boys' pig
clubs. ;
When the pigs arrive and before
the boys take them to, their respective
homes, Mr. Blacklock will secure good
photographs of them and the pictures
will be used for advertising purposes.
DRILLING REDUCED
Second Regiment Has Attained the
Status of Real Soldiers
Black Point, Aug. 25 Owing to the
natural aptness, willingness and intel
ligence of the soldiers of the Second, a
large per cent, of the strenuous drill
ing that has been the daily schedule
of the troops since shortly after
reaching here June 21, has been cut
down to regular army proportions
which is agreat deal lighter than the
men have been receiving lately.
Drill period has been reduced to
three hours in the morning instead of
four and a half, with several after
noons off during each week, which is
a great deal more agreeable to the
men, but the officers' school period
has been increased to three hours
daily, which keeps gentlemen wearers
of the leather puttees more or less
busy all the time. However, they are
gaining1 knowledge and none of them
regret losing the time to acquire it.
Major Brady and Captain Reed, reg
ular army inspectors, are said to have
remarked to an outside officer that
the Second Florida regiment was on
a par with any National Guard regi
ment in the United States and they
have inspected many if not all of them
of late.

Washington,' Aug. 25. President

arate conferences to discuss the pro
posals that have developed from his
original settlement plan.
NO CHANGE IN THE SITUATION
The president conferred with the

wanted their views on legislation to
prevent future recurrences of a situa
tion which threatens a . nation-wide

the, situation was unchanged and that
no complete and concrete proposition
to which the railroads had agreed was

TOO LATE
Adams Tried to Have State Ex
ecutive Committee Give Catts
Its Endorsement
Jacksonville, Aug. 25. The organ
ization meeting of the state central
committee yesterday was a good deal
tamer than had been looked for,
though a row was doubtless averted
by adjournment without consideration
of a resolution brought up by Hal W.
A Sams of Lafayette.
Mr. Adams' resolution was offered
just after Wells of Washington had
moved to adjourn. It provided for
united democratic support of .all the
nominees declared by the state can
vassing board on June 26. The gen
eral opinion was that it was in the
interest of Catts.
Efforts were made to have Well3
withdraw his motion to adjourn but
he would not do this and as the mo
tion is not debatable and takes pre
cedence of all others, Chairman Ra
ney put it without the Adams resolu
tion being read before the committee.
The motion to adjourn was declared
carried arid the Adams resolution did
not get before the house.
Many other committeemen brought
resolutions to the meeting, but after
their arrival here and an opportunity
to size up the situation they did not
seem anxious to put them up.
George P. Raney was re-elected
chairman of the committee, with O. L.
Eaton of Monticello treasurer. Henry
V. Sales of Bronson was elected sec
retary to succeed George Fisher of
DeLand, who has been secretary for
many years, but who was not return
ed as a member of the committee thi3
year.
Three names were selected for pres
idential electors to fill the vacancies
in the party ticket caused by the fact
that T. M. Dozier and Oscar M. John
son of Jacksonville and Harry L.
Bethel of Tallahassee, neglected to
file their campaign statement of ex
penses. The three selected were Will
