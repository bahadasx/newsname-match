IMPORTANT MEETING HELD LAST
EVENING "
Expert Bend Attorney to Prepare All
Documents in Election Without
Charge if Keeler .Brothers are Suc
cessful Bidders for Bonda Other
wise Charge Will Be One Per Cent
of Bend Issue.
At an informal meeting last even
ing witli the local railroad committee,
tho city council indicated its inten
tion tu employ attorneys of the Keeler
Itroihets bonding house to englhecr
the election for a $300,000 bond issue
to help build the Central Oregon rail
road. The meeting last evening waa
informal, and the city la not bound by
any expressions of the councllmen;
yet It is confidently expected that at
the regular meeting next Monday ever
ning a resolution employing attorneys
for Keller Brothers wUl be paaaed by
the council.
Keeler Brothers' proposition to en
gineer the. election ia this: If the
bond issue carries atrirlecpnaaii,
Keeler Brothers are the' successful,
bidders for the bond, no charge wlU
be made for the legal services; if the'
issue carries, but. some other firm
buys the bonds, a charge of one per
cent of the issue will be, made for..ea
gineering the election; .it the election
rails, 300 will be charged for the
attorneys' work. If some other firm ,
is the successful bidder, such excess
uver Keeler Brothers' bid would un
doubtedly pay the legal expenses.
Fred Glenn of Portland, 'resident,
manager for Keeler Brothers, was at
the meeting last evening, and stated
bis company's proposition. He said
ho made the offer because bis com
pany intended to buy the bonds, and
wanted them to be legal and salable.
City Attorney Rollo Ct Groesbeck
recommended to the council that the .
city avail itself of this opportunity to
secure a bond issue that will stand in
court, such proceedings involving a
hih degree of technicality possessed
only by attorneys making a specialty
of such work.
