RAILROAD PRESIDENTS

is very pleasant at
Washington, Aug. 23. In another
' effort to aid the presidents of the
country's railroads to find some .way
in which to accept an eight-hour day
for their trainmen and avert the
threatened strike, President Wilson
tonight conferred for an hour and a
half with Presidents Hale Holden of
the Burlington, Daniel Willard of the
Baltimore and Ohio and R. S. Lov-
ett, of the Union Pacific.
Neither white house officials nor the
president would discuss the conference
It is said on authority, however, that
the three executives went to the white
house to receive an answer to the sug
gestion they made to Mr. Wilson last
night that he give them more specific
information as to how the railroads
may get the additional revenue neces
sary to take care of the greater pay.
rolls that will come with the 8-hour
day.
Earlier in the day President Wilson
discussed the railroad situation at
length with Senator Newlands and
Representative Adamson, chairmen of
the two committees of congress in
charge of legislation affecting inter
state commerce. Their visit was the
consequence of that of the railroad
men last night. ' . .
The two chairmen are said to have'
agreed that the president's proposal
in the present situation was right and
to have said that every effort could be
expected in congress to put through
any legislation which might help solve
the present difficulty and provide for
the future.
One of the means for recouping sug
gested by. the president to the rail
roads in his public outline of his posi
tion ' was through an increase in
freight rates. It was pointed out to
night that the president cannot direct
ly ask the interstate commerce com
mission to grant increases to the rail-
. roads. Congress,. however, might pass
a resolution directing the -commission
in view of what it considers an unpre
cedented situation to grant higher
"'" rates. '
. It became evident tonight that most
x of "the railroad executives have come
to believe that there can "be only one
way of preventing a strike and that is
by accepting the eight-hour day plan.
The cWef effort 3n -their -own confer
ences tonight was to find some scheme
fcy which an eight-hour day may be
put in operation on all the" railroads
at the least added expense.'"" -

London, Aug. 23. With no impor

The latest dispatches, however, throw

sum represents pension money Evans

twenty years. He never used a cent
of the pension money. As soon as his

PROMINENT PROGRES.
SIVE SURRENDERS
St. Louis, Aug. 23. Scores of
former Republicans and Progres
sives are dropping into State Demo
cratic Headquarters daily and offering
their services to the Committee in
bringing about the triumphant re
election of President Wilson and put
ting Colonel Gardner into the execu
tive chair of the state by an over
whelming majority.
Notable among the callers, yester
day, was Percy Stone, a leading St.
Louis business man, who, until 1912,
was one of the most active Republi
cans in St. Louis. He espoused the
cause of Colonel Roosevelt when the
party split, and was one oi tne iouna
ers of the Progressive party in Mis
souri, being made a member of the
State Committee.
"I am here to surrender," said Mr.
Stone. "Not half way, but all the
way, tor l snail io an m my power
for the success of both the Demo
cratic National and State tickets. I
cannot understand how any Progres
sive who was actuated by principle
when he left the Republican party can
vote for Judge Hughes or endorse the
Republican platform of 1916. I shall
vote for President Wilson as I believe
every lover of his country should do.
He has stood the acid test. Colonel
Gardner shall have my earnest sup- .
port. He is a business man and will
give Missouri a business administra
tion."
