Oklahoma Senator Declares
Republican Senators Are
Trying to Prevent Action
Before Elections.

Action of Senator May Hold
Congress in Session for
Months in Order to Pass or
Defeat the Measure.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 24. Republi
can senators were accused today by
Senator Owen of a deliberate effort
to prevent action before the Novem
ber election on his corrupt practices
bill, which would put strict limita
tions on campaign contributions.
Then the Oklahoma senator announc
ed that be would make an insistent
fight to bring up the measure at this
session of congress regardless of con
sequences to early adjournment plans
He declared the existing campaign
funds law was a fraud on the Ameri
can people, charged that the so-called
lumber trust had spent $40,000 in Ok
lahoma to defeat his renomination
because he voted to deny Wm. Lori
mer a seat In the Senate and preci
pitated a lively debate in which Re
miblican and Democratic senators
bitterly accused each other of plan
nine to buy the ppproaching election.
. All the carefully laid plans of Sen
ate leaders to make possible an ad
journment of coneress late next week
were threatened when Senator Owen
snnounced that he was ready to stay
here until winter to pass the bill if
Republicans attempted a filibuster.
He said he would make a motion to
take it up as soon as the revenue bill
was pasped. Last week Democratic
leaders thought they bad enough
votes to defeat such a motion pledged
from senators who desire an adjourn
ment. Whether Senator Owen's sen
sational presentation of his plan for
action has chansed that situation is
problematical. Should his motion
prevail, Rennblienn leaders say a
prolonged fiiht will be made on the
measure, which they insist is imprac
ticable of enforcement in its present
form.
When the Oklahoma senator de
clared the so-called lumber trust had
iisod i i0.noo fund aealnst him. Sen
ator Penrose. Republican, interjected
"It is reported that it cost the Dem
ocratic party tl.001,000 to elect Wood
row Wilson."
"How about the $2,500,000 snent to
elect Wm. McKinley In 1S96?" In
quired Senator O'Gorman.
'Thut might bave been so," Sena
tor Penrose replied.
Resuming his speech. Senator Owen
said he had figures showing that
Mv-ron T. Herrick, recently nominat
ed for senator by Republicans in
Ohio, bad personally expended $22,
155 in his primary campaign and that
the "Herrick Voters league had spent
$29,000."
"It is not difficult to understand
why the Republicans of the senate
do not want this bill to pass now."
said Senator Stone, interrupting his
Democratic colleaene. "The reason
is that they export to b'lv the ap
proaching national election."
"I have beaH it stated that the
Democrats are trying to buy it and
that thev alreadv have raised a laree
fund," Senator Gallinger, the Repub
lican leader, said.
"I have heard," said Senator Pen
rose, "that the Democrats already
have an enormous campaign fund and
that they now want to lock the door."
"The people of the T'nited States
are not going to stand any more the
buying of elections." Senator Owen
continued. "The people are demand
ing this law because the existing
Rtatute does not protect them."
Senator Penrose said the Republi
cans would be willing to stay here
until the bill could be perfected, if
necessary, but that would take a long
time and would be better to wait until
December.

"I have shown that the administra

to the administrations which have in- j

Charles E. Hughes, speaking before
an audience that crowded every avail
able foot of space In the great Mor
mon Tabernacle here tonight, assailed
the administration for "specious dis
regard" of the civil service regula-

declared that he stood for faithful
observance of the civil service and
asserted that lie would extend its
sphere if elected . I
Mr. Hughes spoke with the Demo

platform and with other Democratic
candidates and party officials, spe
cially invited guests, in the hall.
"We have had under this adminis

provisions to the effect that it should
not be necessary in making the ap
pointments to conform to the merit

"Spurious excuses were made. They

I Mr. Hughes referred to "claims of
I all kinds that they want efficiency of

"I should not expect you would
think what I say worthy of special
attention," he said, "were it not that
I have devoted four of the best years
of my life, regardless of polities, to

Violent Bombardment Con
tinuous by French Allies
South of the Present Of
fensive of Western Forces.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS. Aug. 24. (4:29 p. m.) The
French are violently bombarding the
German lines from Estees. which
marks the southern extremity of
their present offensive, to Lasstgny. a
; distance of about 30 miles, according
' to the war correspondent of La
: Liberte.
I The correspondent says that heavy
cannonading is in progress along the
line from Vermandovillers through
Lihons, Chaulnes and Royeto Las
signy. The destructive tire has driven
the German airmen across the French
lines, contrary to their custom. They
are apparently trying lj reconnoiter
the positions of the allied artillery.
j "Captive German baloons again
have appeared in the air." says the
correspondent, "but were withdraw!
quickly when attacked by French air -
men. Scouting machines sent out by
the Germans were driven back after
numerous air battles. The artillery
action in the last "fi hours over the
entire Stimnie- front reached an extra
ordinary intensity. The German guns
replied vigorously and some of their
batteries were silenced."
WAR SUMMARY
Striking simultaneously, the British
and French have made substantial
gains on the Somme front, according
to Paris and London. Maurepas has .
fallen to the French, who have pushed
forward more than 200 yards beyond
the town on a front of a mile and a i
quarter. The British report a "00
yard advance south of Thiopvnl and
the capture of many prisoners.
The capture of Maurepas leeve
Clery almost surrounded and brings
the French directly in front of the ,
important railroad town of Combles.
Thiepval is in about the same posiiien '
as Clery and the allied front as do ;
scribed now resembles the teeth of a 1
great saw between which the Ge:
mans are tenaciously holding the
ruins of several villages.
Dispatches from the Somme f-ont
indicate that the French are prepar

Will Urge Freight Rate In

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 24 Objec-
j tions which developed tonight at the
i meeting of railroad presidents ami
managers to points in the tentative
plan, evolved by the committee of
i eight presidents considering ways to
i avert the threatened general strike.
resulted in a further postponement of
final action. The conference adjourn
ed to meet again tomorrow, and. as
the President phrased it. the situa
tion is such that "it may be settled
in twenty minutes or the matter may
go Over until next week."
A statement issued by the railroad
executives tonight summed the matter
up this way:
"At the invitation of President Wil
son. Messrs. Hale Holden. Jud.e R. S.
Lovett and Deniel Wiliard ent to
the White House at noon and held a
short conference with the President.
A conference of the railroad execu
tive a:s h.'ld at two o clock and the
I matter was laid before the conference.
"After considerable discussion, with
i out definite action, an adjournment
was taken until 11 o'cloc k tomorrow
morning. In the meantime the spe
cial committee of the presidents will
' continue its labors."
The special committee's plan, as
. drafted after a week's consideration,
i would provide for granting an eight
j hour "basic" day to the trainmen but
' with assurance that every effort
' would be made by the administration
to secure a freight rate increase to
' recompense the roads, and further as
; surance that Congress mould be asketl
to enact legislation to Insure settle
ment of future labor disputes through
an investigation committee.
The entire plan has not been laid
before all the executives and managers
but its points have been discussed at
the various conferences. It developed
that objection had been raided to
the freight rate increase feature on at
least two grounds. It was argued by
some that there can be no assurance
of a rate increase because no one
could say what the interstate cOm
: merce commission might do and that
' some of the most important shippers
of the country already hae made it
; plain that they are not in sympathy
'with any move which may mean a rate
1 increase.
It was pointed Out also that al
though President Wilson has expressed
his belief that a rate increase should
i be granted if the eight hour day is
given the employes, no one can tell
how that is coming out and that ther.?
I can be no possibility Of an increase
before next March or probably later.
Attention was called too, to the
! fact that the committee hitherto has
' held they cannot consider mage
standards in dealing with proposed
rate increases, although, legislation by
Congress might remove that difficulty.
The Drincipal arguments against
the idea of a permanent committee
for the prevention or settlement of
strikes was that it would at mo.-t
certainly be fought by lal'ir ia Con
gress, and that while President Wil
son might be entirely milling now to
back such legislation, he might be in
a position to do so when it was prcv
posed.
The special committee's plan had
been tentatively accepted by the com
mittee of eight and it was the subject
of today's conterence at the White
House. Its substance mas com
municated to the labor representatives
through Judge William L. Chamber,
of the board of mediation and concilia
