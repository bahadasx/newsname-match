The Candidates and the Office
Each Seeks
The candidates for nomination
for county offices have been rath
er busy the past few days and
will no doubt continue so until
next Tuesday when the voter will
express his choice at the polls.
In Fallon County, both repub
lican and democratic tickets are
nearly complete and in most in
stances there is "a fight on" for
for the nomination. For Judge
of the 16th judicial district the
republicans have two candidates,
Sharpless Wa'ker and S. D, Mc
Kinnon while the democrats pre
sent only the name of Daniel
O'Hern. For representative,
Berry Morris of Baker has no
opposition on the democratic
ticket but Edwin S. Booth and
J. A. Williams are both after the
republican nomination. For
sheriff, Mat Jones is the only
democratic candidate, with Geo.
Boggs and Henry Viles, both of
Ekalaka aftet the majority of the
republican votes. Both of these
men are well known, Mr. Boggs
having had previous experience
in the sheriff's office of Custer
county as a deputy and Mr. Viles
being a well known stockman of
this section. F. C. Bunn and T.
J. Martin want the republican
nomination for county clerk. Mr.
Bunn has held the office for the
past three years and Mr. Martin
thinks this is enough for one man
and that it ought to be passed
around. Emil Lentz, the present
county treasurer, is the demo
cratic candidate for the county
clerk job. For treasurer, there
are two candidates on each tick
et, R. B. Lowry the present dep
uty in the assessor's office and
E. H. Trandum the present dep
uty treasurer being the demo
cratic men and VV. W. Palmer of
Ekalaka and Geo. Hough of Bak
er the G. 0. P. boys. L. J. 0'
Grady of Piniele wants the nom
ination from the democrats for
auditor and L. E. Rushton of
Baker is asking the same favor
only from the republicans. For
clerk of court, Ralph Keener, the
present "man on the job" has
mo opposition on either ticket.
P. C. Cornish, Joseph Hodgson, ;
Leon L. Wheeler, all republicans,
and Chas. Dousman, a democrat,
after the county attorney nomi
nation. Miss Annette Leanord,
the present county superintend
ent of schools has no ooposition i
for the republican nomination for
this office, while Miss Carrie
Bachtle is the only candidate ûp
by the democrats. E. 0. Colvin
is the only person seeking the
job of coroner and for county
surveyor J. C. Cory is alone in
the race. But everyone it seems !
wants to be commissioner. There j
are two candidates to be selected, !
one for the six year term and one
l'or the two year term. Horace
Sparks of Baker and Ped Akers
of Willard want the long term j
nomination from the democrats
and George Farwell of Sykes the
short term job. On the repub-1
lican ticket VV. I. Maxwell, F. E.
McFarland and T. F. Schofield
seek the long term nomination j
and James Munro, F. W. Schreib
er, Dean Howeli and Carl Bonclell
the two year nomination.

The G. O. P. Candidate
No doubt, Charles E. Hughes
is a good man and a clean man
and an honest man, but the im- ;
pression that the average un
biased American citizen will get
from his speeches is that he is a
fault-finding, somber, negative, ;
do-nothing character entirely out.!
of harmony with the great sun- !
shiny, optimistic, constructive |
American people.
During a recent short trip'
across the Canadian border Mr. !
Hughes was held up and his car
searched for explosives. As;
there was nothing more danger
ous than his Detroit speech, he !
and his party were liberated very j
promptly.
It was only after he became a 1
candidate that Mr. Hughes found
that he favored the submission \
of the suffrage amendment. He
did not register or vote when t he ;
matter of suffrage was before
the people of his state.
WHO'S PONY?
/S
Now is the time for the boys to enter ihe Eagle's Shetland Pony

Accredited School
We arc about to start on an
other school term and there
seems to be varied opinions as tn
the standing of our high school
and the credit of the work done.
To clear this matter up and re
move all doubt 1 beg to offer the
wording of a communient ion re
ceived from the state office.
"Helena, Mont., June CO, 191G
Prin. F. L. Funkenbusch,
Eka'aka, Montana.
Dear si»*
This is to notify you that your
school has been accredited for
the two years of work which
you have pursued during the last
year.
Yurv truiy.
H. A. Davee
Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion. "
This assurres every pupil who
does high school work in the
Ekalaka High School that they
will receive credit for that
amount of work in any other ed
ucational institution they may
wish to enter in the state. Like
money, it is good for that much
wherever they go. It is worthy
of your notice that in the past
vear our graded school lias been
made Standard and the high
school accredited. This fact,
that both departments are re
cognized by the state office means
much not only to Ekalaka and
vicinity but southern Fallon
county as well, in addition, the
school will be belter than last,
year for "Stanriaru" and "Ac
credited" are now capital.
F. L. Funkenbusch,
Principal.
P. E. Hubbard. .T. M. Corn stock
and J. E. Buscn were Baker vis
itors in town yesterday.
