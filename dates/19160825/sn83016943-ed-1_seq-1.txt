MACON, MISSISSIPPI, FRIDAY. AUGUST 25, 1916.
NUMBER 45
67th YEAR
THE
CIRCUIT COURT.
What was probably the'Jargest crowd
that ever attended an operting day of
court greeted Judge Carroll when court
convened at 8 o'clock last Monday
morning. I Because of a light docket
and depleted condition of the county's
treasury, 'and a further reason, because
it was thought that the farmeri could
not spare the time from their crops to
attend court, a strong petition was
sent to Judge Carroll to have this term
of court pretermitted. The size of the
crowd was a contradiction of the idea
thht the farmers could not leave their
craps and Judge Carroll stated in his
charge that he found it poor economy
to pretermit a term of court, as it only
lengthened a made moie expensive the
tei m thnt followed.
Judge Carroll's charge was forceful
and easy to understand and while pri
marily directed to the grand-jurymen
as to their duty as such, it 'was a fine
Bermon on citizenship and could have
been heard witn profit by every citizen
of the county.
Following is a summary of the court's
proceedings as taken from the docket :
T. B. Carroll, judge
G J. Rencher, district attorney.
Dr F. Allgood, county attorney
J. T. McClure, sheriff.
C. V. Adams, clerk.
Frank D. Ellis, stenogropher.

GRAND JURY'S REPORT.
TotheHon T.B.Crroll. Judge of the Circuit
Court, Noxubee County:
We the Grand Jury of Noxubee
k Anmiat term. 1916. re-
county iu m - -- .
spectfully report to the court as fol-
have been in session 2H days,
Vioned 18 witnesses and examined
36 witnesses " and returned into open
court 10 true bills."
I IThe committee appointed by us to
examine the public scnooi ouiicnngs,
report that the public school building
has all doors oneniiic on the inside ex
cept the main front door, which opens
on the outside.
The committee that inspected the
poor house report that the premises
appear to be sanitary but that the
backs to the chimneys need repairing
badly and that they should be supplied
with fire does and we recommend that
the board of supervisors repair the
chimneys and provide the fire dogs.
The committee that examined the
pnnntw hnnWa rpnnrr. that", thpv are flf
j r J r
parently neatly and correctly kept and
in eAarninirn ine bhiu uouhb we utic
informed by the county auditor that
some of the supervisors for the past 4
years had overdrawn the ami unts
due them under the law and naa paia
same back into the county treasury ex
cept one or two of them and they also
reported that the former superintend
ent of education had drawn more than
allowed by law and that same had not
been paid back to the county.
It appears that said amounts were
not drawn with any intent to violate
the law, but rather by mistake.
'We recommend that the proper and
constituted authorities for the county
proceed at once to enforce the return
of said monies to the county.
We went to the jail in a body and re
port that same appears to be well kept
and in a sanitary condition.
We reported that Walter Lee Wil
liams was under a bond of $100.00 to
appear before us and that he failed to
appear.
Owing to the stringent times, failure
in crops, etc., we did not think it best
to continue in session longer than ac
tually necessary, thereby saying as
much expense as possible to our coun
ty-
We think that there is much less
violation of the law in our county than
icrmeny, such as gambling, carrying
pistols and selling liquors.
We thank your Honor for yonr clear
and instructive charge to us an i the
District and County Attorneys, as well
as the Sheriff and Circuit Clerk for
their assistance given in the discharge
of our duty.
Having finished our labors, we ask
to be discharged.
Very respectfully,
C. M. Scales, Foreman.
Schools To Open
High School Opening
The Macon Graded and High School
opens its next session Monday morning,
September 11. at nine o'clock. Chil
dren will report first to their last
year's from which they will be pro
moted to the advanced room. All new
pupils will report in thg superintend
ent's office for classification. Several
announcements for patrons will appenr
in next week's issue of the Beacon.
Agricultural High School to Open
The Agricultural High School will be
ready for the reception of Students
Monday, Sept. 4th, 1916.
The dining hall will open at noon. A
great many students can reach Macon
but are unable to get out to the school,
and for this reason the school wagon
will leave from the court house Mon
day, Sept. 4th, 1916, at 2:00 o'clock.
All trunks will be handled by the
freight wagons. Let me urge that
new students arrive Monday if possi
in order that the faculty may classify
them and be ready for work Tuesday,
Sept. 5.
The opening address will be deliv
ered by P. P. Garner, State Commis
sioner of Agriculture, at 10:30 o'clock
Tuesday morning.
We extend to the public a very cor
dial invitation to ' be present at our
opening exercises. This is a county
institution and our desire is to be of
every assistance possible to the coun
ty. If our extension department can
be of service to you, call us and we
are glad to serve you.
Salem, School Opening
The opening exercises of the Salem
Consolidated School for the session of
1916-17 will be held on Monday, Septem
ber 4th, at nine o'clock. This school
has adopted for its motto and slogan,
"Make It Better;" and in order that
the teachers and pupils may perform
well their part in making this motto
effective, and U at they may get the
necessary inspiration to begin the
year's work with, every patron of the
school is earnestly requested to be
present for the opening exercises. The
scnooi last year naa a very successiui
session, and we hope this year that we
mnir even "Make ft Better." Rutin
doing this it will be necessary for each
ana every iactor or. me scnooi to appiy
.1 11 t 1 Til '
me wen Known principle in rnysics as
reeards the efficiency of machines:
that is, "Work out equals Work in."
In other words, the work got out is
equal to, and never greater than the
work nut in. Adducing the logical
conclusion of this rule, we say that
the efficiency is the ratio of the useful
work got out of anything to the total
work put into it. Therefore, we may
expect to get out of the scnooi just
what we put into it, no more, and no
less.
Again we urge that everybody come
ana be with us at the opening ho r. A
good beginning means much for the
success of the school. We need you.
Come. Yours in the work,
W. B. Jones,
Principal.
FROM THE PEOPLE
Chicago, 111., Aug. 22d,:i916.
Editor of the Beacon:
This morning we moved into our
headquarters. Heretofore we had
teen crowded into two rooms at tne
Blackstone hotel.. We occupy the
sixth floor of the Karpn building, a
handsome twelve story office building
on Michigan avenue. The publicity
bureau has two rooms which front on
the lake. This gives us a fine breeze
and a beautiful view.
Senator Walsh of Montana is at the
head of this, the western headquarters.
He handles men and things so smootn
ly and easily that it reminds one of the
line from one of Gilbert & Sullivan's
operas-"He does it so politely it is
music to the ear. '.' Senator Hollis or.
New Hampshire, the first Democratic
senator from that state for fifty years,
has charge of the labor bureau. He is
the author of the rural credits law,
and an able man. Congressman Scott
Ferris of Oklahoma, has charge of the
organization bureau. He is about the
height and size of Ed Robbins, but not
quite so handsome. He asked me
about Brooke said he had heard of him
through his pro-German sympathies.
The Dublicitv bureau is in charge of
Wm. J. Cochran. Washington corres-
pondent of the St. Louis Republic, and
a very live wire. We have all the
states west of the Mississippi and some
few in the middle west and Tennessee
and Kentucky. Mr. Cochrane handles
the dailies and I the weeklies, includ
the weekly editions of the big dailies.
You will get the matter I send out
every week. It will be sent to some
thing over 4000 papers.
From this point everything looks
very hopeful for Wilson. If he makes
a satisfactory settlement of the strike
situation, it will count tremendously in
his favor,
I am constantly being reminded of
various old friends of Noxubee. I was
reminded of Jim Horton the other
night at a vaudeville show. Two ne
groes and ramshackle Ford kept the
audience laughing halt an hour. They
finally found a fc.icW.in the machine
which had eaten all the nuts. One of
the negroes reminded me of John
Holmes, who wears small thirteens
and "God knows uey hurt his feet."
His companion said "No wonder nig
ger you always got a bad cold wid dem
big feet of yours, so much of your
pusson is exposed to the cold groun.'
I notice that they cheer Dixie up
here more than any other piece of
music, jiA like they do down south. I
was surprised to find that at nearly
every performance they slam the Ger
mans a little and the audience mani
fests its approval. They cheer, at the
shows I have been to, Wilson more
than they do Hughes.
I saw Col. Sellers the other day. He
blew in and took a seat and waited
two hours to Bee Senator Walsh. He
sat near my desk and I overheard all
he was saying to another waiter. He
was Col. Mulberry, all right. He told
how he had stumped three western
states for Bryan and had carried them
all. He exhibited an envelope with a
line from Bryan on it, inviting him to
come into the railroad coach he was
riding in, etc., etc, A minute later he
was telling about a breakfast food he
had invented containing 25 different
ingredients, the finest thing in the
world, and-these are his exact words
"Thsrc's millions in it." H. M.
Mary Mac Flouriehing
A wonderful crop is waiting for the
harvest on the Mary Mac plantation.
There are 7,000 acres of as fine cot
ton as the State of Mississippi affords.
Besides there are 2,000 acres in corn,
400 acres in alfalfa, and about 500
acres in oats has been harvested. The
Mary Mac boasts of 150 Berkshire
brood bows and 60 Per:heron brood
mares.
Prof. Archibold Smith is in charge.
The plantation is 29 miles south oi
Memphis, at Robinsonville, Miss.

Missionary Society Meets
The ladies of the missionary societies
of the Baptist church were entertained
in a moat' delightfully novel manner,
at the home of Mrs. D. S. Barclay, on
Monday afternoon.
Cnriosity-arousing little missives,
bearing a scarlet seal, had found their
way to the many members during the
previous week.
Mrs. Barclay, in her own sweetly
gracious way, welcomed her guests in
to a sitting room made cool and invit
ing by (electric) summer breezes, and
soft tones, both of color and of sound.
The musical program was indeed a
rare treat. "Creating an atmosphere"
for the right understanding and enjoy
ment of each selection, by brief inter
esting descriptions of what each was
intended to express, she made it possi
ble for every guest to appreciate each
number rendered.
Since the leading feature of the pro
gram was to be a contest on "The
Women of the Bible," each thought
introduced suggested the woman at
mosphere. Mrs. Delia Dupree won
the Bible Women contest, Mrs. Clark
the contest on familiar hymn tunes, by
women writers. Each winner was
presented with a beautifully illustrated
pocket Testament as a souvenir of the
occasion.

Court Notes
Mr. Hugh McQueen sued Dr. Bush
and Mr. Will Bush for bumping into
his buggy while they were en route to
the Jackson fair last fall. Mr. Mc
Queen was not jarred out of his seat
and no evidence was offered that the
buggy was damagek to the extent of
ten thousand dollars, the amount sued
for, so the jury returned in a few
minutes, the following verdict: "We,
the jury, find the defendant not
guilty," having evidently arrived at
the conclusion that while the doctor's
offense might have been criminal, he
was not guilty.
The suit tt J. O. Faser against the
Cumberland Telephone Co. for failure
to turn in the alarm more promptly
when his house was burned last March
a j ear ago, was settled out of court,
the company paying , Mr. Faser the
sum of 3400.
The grand jury adjourned Tuesday
after being in session a day and a half.
They were re-convened Thursday
morning for the purpose of rc-indict-
ing the Finklea boys for writing their
stepfather, W. J. Barnhill, a black
hand letter. It is undei stood that the
jury has taken up and is investigating
the cattle stealing that is alleged to
have been going on east of Macon for
several months.
