in due it' -i the h'akr was brought
Iup for trig in the ncrlliaal court, antd
the pr'esidtie judge at that court was
('ambo. lie had come to the conclu
sion. alt,. tutminatng over all the law
he had abl rheid in the course of his
car-. . n.,.. ihe had no right to act
frmui his own private knowledge in a
matter brought before him in his offi
cial capacity. Learned writers, dis
cussing the case, have said that he
acted conscientiously, and a few have
expressed their belief that he acted
properly. Such is the reverence for
law.
The baker came up for trial, a
wretclhed and terrified man. The po
lice had a strong case against him. lie
was arreste'd just as he was leaving
tle corpse. and he had the sheath of a
dagger or stiletto in his pocke(t. But
as the case wore on it became ap
parent that the evidenc.- wasn't con
clusive enough. and there was a prob
ahbi!ity that the accused would hc ac
lquittt'd
Then this marvelous Judge ('ambo
used every endeavor to make the
baker confess the crime. lie threat
ened and entreated, but the accused
persisted in declaring his innocence.
So Judge ('ambo ordered him to the
torture and he was stretched upon the
rack. For a time he stuck to his claim
of innocence, hut when the agony be
came intolerable he confessed to the I
crime which he had never committed.
and Judge Cambo looked on. calm and
inscrutable, and wrote down the
racked man's confession as it came
from his blood-flecked lips. Surely
there never was a more zealous public
otticial than Judge Cambo'
The judge was now quite satisfied.
The prisoner had been proved guilty
according to the law. and there was
nothing further to do, except to sen
tence the man to death, which the
judge did with much fteeling, rebuking
him mildly for trying to obstruct the
coir' se of justice by refusing to conl
io·s. So the unfortunate baker was
taken forth from the jail uIpon a low
( ring day and done to death by tlh cx
lt' oiner.

Atlong other thiugs, lie confessed that
hl was the mnurderer of the lman for
whose death the baker was tortur rd
and executed. He narrated all the cir
cunmstances of the murder, down to
th, smnallest detail, and cited the judge
as a witness, lie knew that the judge
had sotn t'ie murder, for, as he was
plunging his knife into the victim's
body. he happened to see the judge at
the window, and the judge was looking
straight at him.
The grand master of the knights
now called upon the judge for an ex
planation and ('ambo quietly admitted
that the man's story was strictly true.
But he argued that he had only done
his duty; that it was quite proper to
send a man to an ignominious death
rather than violate the sacred law as
t, rtndersttodl it. The judge was sen
tonced to the forfeiture of his otijce
a:.d to Iubli dtigradation, and was or
dered to ttrrn over his worldly assets
to the fruiily of his victia. lie lived
a fe'w anar,. shunned and hated as
much as he formerly was admired and
rt. l·ieterl. and with the knowledlge
that his name was a hissing all over
the world.
Decorations for Women.
For, on ollItrl.es are mo:;t iroii-al
of feminininel drorat!ons. There are in
all son 2', foreign orders. and it is
s:aid that Spain was the first country
to honor thI! gentler sex by includ;::g
thin in orlots of chivalry. The Le.
iion o;f i. n:lor. whir h has been pinnfed
to rot a I, \ fet ni:tinni brtasts ill thie
Iresent \war. the Russian Order of St.
('athcrine. and the Austrian Star Cross
are a few of the greater orders which
can he accordedtto women. In no
country does thr decoration bestowed
on a woman ca.,ry any title, as in the
ease of a masculine knighthood. but
in several countries certain female
decorations bestow a sort of status
equivalent to rank in the army.
C 3ntrarlness.
"When a girl promises to marry a
man, Miss Girger, isn't it a sure proof
that she loves him?"
"Not at all. She might do it just
to spite another Ima,"

The Enllish section of Laihore is a
fine and spaciolus Anglo-Indian town,
with an abundance of shade trees,
wooded arcades and palins. The real
Lahore. the actual city of discontent,
is something very different. Many of
the streets are as narrow as alleys,
with the balconies and roofs elbowing
one another. In these alleyways are
some unusually fine examples of clay
and wood canrving, and of lattice and
lacquer work. It is here that the na
