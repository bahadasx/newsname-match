(AMooUMd Ttt by r4ml Wlnlcn)
AftHINOTON, Avgutt 2.VMWtb
A A I th railroad prestdantt wbo
hare been conferring with
Treaident Wllaon over the threatened
railroad xtriVe railing aerioua objec
tiona to the aiiKifeiittona put forward by
.Mr. Wilnon. and the bis ahippera of
'" the nation openly unsympathetic with
hi plan to (jive the men an eiht-hour
dar and help the railroad meet the
extra financial Ktrain by allowing them
to ralae their rates, the railroad aitua
tlon appears to be no nearer a solution
than beror.
Tha President's plan in some of its
aspects Jiad txcn approved by the eon
fe recce of .the telret (ommittee of rail
road heads,' bat others of them fouod
weak points in the proposals made by
the Chief Executive. They pointed out
has been pfllt pored, the foelinit i that
some parts of the President's plan are
impraetioable, . They asserted that the
proposal to iaereasa freight rates, in
rrder to meet tha added demands upon
the lines, caused by.' the introduction
of the eight hour day will be extremely
- difficult to carry into effect.
Commissions Action Problem
tt is impossible, they declared, to tell
what the Iiuerstato commerce commis
sion will do witk tha question or in
creased rates, when it is submitted to
that body. Even should the commis
sion deride to fellow the proposed in
creases, the new rates could not go in
to effect before next March, by phiuh
time it is possible that another nd
minnttfation will be In power, and one
which it is pointed out, may be an
tagonist in ta the plan of settlement
proposed by the present authorities.
The' attitude of the big shippers
throughout the country is also having
its effect upon the railroad heads. The
suggestion that the roads be allowed'
to recoup themselves by raising their
rates bus drawn scores of protests
from all parts of the country aud
from all clnSHes of shippers.
The shippers declare that the inter
state commerce commission has repeat
edly refused to perm ft any increase
of rntes, us asked by the railroads,
and that the business of i the eountrv
win not bear the additional load such
an Increase would mean.
Statement of Attttuda
Earlier in the dny the select com
mittee of the railroad presidents issued
a statement following their conference
with Mr. Wilson, in which It was aaia
that the mil road presidents are willing
to accept, the eiaht-honr day demanded
hv the men. nnd In ret am ask for as
surances of the President's support and
that of the government to secure per
mission from the Interstate Commerce
Commission to. increase freight rates.
The railrouda ask tongress to create
a pennunt'iit board to handle all future
lubor dirticultiea. This board, they
sav. should be empowered to investi
gate threatened trouble and contro.
versy.
Peace Pending Settlement
While its iovestication is in prog
rein, no strike or strike vote is to be
nllowed. The results of the investiga
tion are to be muds public.
At the end of such investigation
arbitration will be suggested to settle
the outstanding points, hut in the event
of no acceptance of arbitration oppor
tunity will be given for a strike vote,
and in this strike vote the balloting
shall .be secret.
The representatives of the men are
npi)rrnt'v favorably disposed to ac
cept the plan.

At five minutes after midnight flames
were seen to be licking from a aeawnrd

his rifle. v
Immediately life stirred in the eleop

their dreams at the ' sound of a bugle
summoning them to fire emergency.
within three minutes they were
swarming around the rapidly burnio
building.' Ladders, chemical engine an

them and had often passed playful
words with them.
When a hysterical womln screamed
thftt the children were in the burning
hirllding. a docen men rushed through
the smoke and flame to rescue the
babes they thought were within.
Today there are burned arms and
scorched faces, singed eyelashes and
absent eyebrowa to testify to the ah
solute disregard of persona) safety
evinced by the ready and willing boys
of Fort De Bussy, who responded with
out a moment's hesitation when they
thought young livea awaited rescue
within the rapidly burning structure.
There are numerous popular boarding

One Soldier Vaarly incinerated
One of the Fort De Buasy boys, on
the roof trying to do work with a bose,
narrowly escaped being dropped into
the incinerating mass when the roof
fell. By a clever backward spring he
escaped with nothing worse than n
lame back.
The Makiki Are department respond

and when the men of the city fire de
partment arrived they found that the
best that Aould be procured waa a
forty-foot stream of water.- The city
department could do nothing more thun
had already been done by the soldiers,
and that was to safeguard surrounding
frame buildings, of which there are a
eonsiderable number.
In tweuty two minutes from the time
the first flame waa observed there wus
nothing left of the building suvu
charred and glowing underpinnings.
The men of the United Btatea regular
