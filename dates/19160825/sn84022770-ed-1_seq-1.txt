RAILROAD'S ACCEPT
WILSON'S PROPOSAL
PRESIDENT WINS THEM TO HIS
PLAN TO AVOID NATION
WIDE STKIKE.
Convinced that they must accept
President Wilson's suggestions as a
basis for the settlement of their dis
pute with their employes, in order to
avert a nation-wide railroad strike,
the presidents of 60 of the railroads
of the United States are now striving
to devise a plan whereby the eight
tour day may be put into effect on
their systems with the least possible
additional expense.
The crux of the president's sugges
tion is acceptance of the eight-hour
day and the settlement of allied ques
tions, such as wages, freight rates,
overtime rates and the like, by an
impartial commission authorized by
congress to conduct an investigation
after the eight-hour plan has been in
operation some months to determine
what changes may be needed. The
railroad presidents fought hard for
their argument that all the questions
at issue should be submitted to a
board of arbitration, but the presi
dent has insisted from the outset
upon the acceptance of the eight-hour
day, for reasons advanced In his first
Statement, and the railroad execu
tives have come to realize the impos
sibility of pressing their claim any
further.
Several conferences have taken
place this week between the president
and the railroad chiefs on various
points at issue and the president also
discussed the situation at length with
Senator Newlands and Representative
Adamson, chairman of the two com
mittees of congress in charge of leg
islation affecting interstate commerce.
They are said to have agreed that the
president's position in the present sit
uation is right and to have said that
every effort could be expected in con
gress to put through any legislation
which might help solve the present
difficulty and provide for the future.•
First Proposal Saturday.
The president's first direct state
ment of his views on the situation
and his first proposal of a basis for
settlement was made last Saturday
when he appealed to the railroad offi
cials to abandon their insistence on
arbitration of the dispute and to ac
cept his plan of settlement, already
agreed to by the employes, because,
In his opinion, the railroads are con
tending for a principle which it seem
ingly is Impossible to apply to the
present situation.
In one of the most dramatic scenes
known to the White House in recent
years, the president declared to the
heads of five billion dollars' worth of
properties, assembled at his sum
mons:
"If a strike comes the public will
know where the responsibility rests.
It will not be upon me."
A few minutes later he issued a
statement, saying:
"The public has a right to expect"
acceptance of his plan.
While President Wilson was still
addressing the railroad executives
and telling them they faced "a con
dition, not a principle," his statement
to the country, reviewing his plan and
characterizing it as "a thoroughly
practicable and fair program," was
given out at the White House. In
this statement he urged the adoption
of the eight-hour day because he "be
lieved the concession right," suggest
ed the creation by congress of a small
body of men to investigate the re
sults, and urged the abandonment of
the demand for time and a half over
time pay by the men and the "contin
gent" proposals by the railroads.
The President's Statement.
His statement Is as follows:
"I have recommended the conces
sion of the eight-hour day—that is,
the substitution of an eight-hour day
for the present ten-hour day in all the
existing practices and agreements. 1
made this recommendation because I
believe the concession right. The
eight-hour day now undoubtedly has
the sanction of the judgment of so
ciety In its favor and should be adopt
ed as a basis for wages even where
the actual work to be done cannot be
completed within eight hours.

should be made, in justice to the rail

COUNTY IN OEBT SINCE
1874, IS ON CASH BASIS
Payment of Old Kailroari Bonds This
Week Clears Up All Obligations.
When the 116,000 balance of $75,-
000 in bonds issued June 24, 1874,
was paid the state Tuesday, Thurston
county was freed from debt for the
first time since territorial days and
placed on a cash basis. The bonds
were originally issued when Benjamin
Harned. James Longmire and A. S.
Yantis were county commissioners,
and the proceeds were turned over to
the Olynipia Railway Union for the
construction of the railroad from
Olympia to Tenino.
The bonds at first bore 8 per cent
interest and were to run 25 years,
though redeemable at the county's
option at the end of 10 years. The
contract with the Union was entered
into August 13, 1874, and the rail
road, a narrow-guage line, was com-
pleted July 31, 1878. its formal
opening being made the occasion for
a great jollification.
i :)04 138,500 worth of the
bonds had been redeemed, and the
balance, refunded at half the interest
rate, purchased by the state. In
the early nineties the railroad was
bought by the Port Townsend South
ern when it was in its "boom" days
and converted into a standard guage
roadbed, and contract then made with
the county required the road's opera
tion for 25 years. Service on It was
discontinued last year, when the con
tract expired, and most of the track
was torn up.

payments and privileges to which
their men are now entitled (if such
adjustments are necessary) there is a
wide divergence of opinion.
I "The railroads which have already
adopted the eight-hour day do not
1 seem to be at any serious disadvan
tage in respect to their cost of opera
tion as compared with the railroads
I that have retained the ten-hour day
and calculations as to the cost of the
change must. If made now, be made
without regard to any possible ad
ministrative economies or readjust
ments.
Kxperipnce Only Basis.
1 "Only experience can make it cer
tain what rearrangements would be
fair and equitable either on behalf of
jthe men. or in behalf of the railroads.
(That experience would be a definite
guide to the interstate commerce
commission, for example, in deter
minign whether, as a consequence of
I the change, it would be necessary and
; right to authorize an increase of rates
for the handling and carriage of
freight (for passenger service is not
affected).
"I, therefore, proposed that the de
|mand for extra pay for overtime made
by the men and the contingent pro
! posals of the railroad authorities be
postponed until facts shall have taken
the place of calculations and forecast
with regard to the effects of a change
to the eight-hour day; that, In the
meantime while experience was devel
oping the facts, I should seek, and if
need be. obtain authority from con
gress to appoint a small body of im
partial men to observe and thorough
ly acquaint themselves with the re
sults with a view to reporting to con
gress at the earliest possible time the
facts disclosed by their inquiries, but
without recommendation of any kind;
and that it should then be entirely
open to either or both parties to the
present controversy to give notice of
a termination of the present agree
ments with a view to instituting in
quiry into suggested readjustments of
pay or practice.
"This seems to be a thoroughly
practical and entirely fair program
and I think that the public has the
right to expect its acceptance."

measures intended to lower the prices
of raw logged-off land and to make it
more available for settlement will
also be discussed. The morning and

of second-degree arson has been filed
in the Pierce county courts against
M. C. Tebbetts, promoter of the con-

COW CONTRACTS
FOR FARM EIPERT
COMMISSION Kits TUESDAY UNAN
IMOUSLY SIGN TWO-YEAR
AGREEMENT.
Contract to re-employ a farm ex-
pert in Thurston county beginning
November 15, at a salary of $ 1,800 a
year and an additional allowance for
expenses, was signed unanimously by
the county commissioners Tuesday,
after two days' conference with R. B.
Coglon of Pullman, state supervisor
of county agriculturists. The action
is in line with a petition recently pre
sented by the Pomona Grange and en
dorsed by practically every subordi
nate Grange in the county, and other
farmers' organizations.
The contract is for two years and
the first signer was Commissioner A.
M. Rowe, who last winter led the op
position to the renewal of the con
tract under which O. C. Van Houten
had been employed as agriculturist
during 1915. The commissioners and
Supervisor Coglon failed to agree on
the amount the county should allow
for expenses, and consequently the
contract contains the provision that
if the commissioners and expert can
not agree on an expense account, the
contract shall be terminated.
Terms of Contract.
j Half of the SI,BOO salary la paid
I by the government and half by the
county, while the expenses are to be
paid by the county. The county also
agrees to furnish the agriculturist an
office in the courthouse and .the use of
an automobile to make his trips
around the county. In return, the
man employed must be satisfactory to
the commissioners, must make week
ly, monthly and yearly reports, and
must file a monthly expense account.
He also must spend every day in the
week but one, in outside work among
the farmers, and the sixth must be
spent In the office where farmers may
call to consult him.
Who the State college will recom
mend to the commissioners to be em
ployed as an expert has not been de
cided, but it is probable, according to
Supervisor Coglon, that D. C. How
ard, assistant professor in the dairy
department of the Oregon Agricul
tural college, a man who had been a
practical farmer all his life until em
ployed by the college, will be suggest
ed. However, if the commissioners
have a man to recommend, the State
College will consider his qualifications
before making any other recom
mendations.
Reverses Former Action.
This action by the commissioners
completely reverses the course they
pursued last winter when, after a
three months' wrangle and several
exciting meetings, they refused to re
new a contract. Referring to that,
Commissioner Dodge is reported to
have said this week: "I realize that
there were many good people in the
county who wanted the agriculturist
retained last January when we let
Van Houten go, but it seemed that
those demanding Van Houten wanted
him or nobody and that seemed im
possible."
In contrast to this, the commis
sioners stated, at every public hear
ing last winter, that Mr. Van Houten
was entirely satisfactory, and did not
ask to have another man recommend
ed for the place.
Postoffloe Surplus $5,200,000.
A surplus of $5,200,000 from the
postal service during the fiscal year
ended June 30 was reported to Presi
dent Wilson this week by Postmaster
General Burleson, who announced
that he had sent a check for that
amount to the treasury.
The Olympia Trades Council this
week announced plans for the annual
Labor Day dance at Central hall on
the evening of September 4, for which
special orchestral music is being ar
ranged and various novelties are
promised that will make It an Inter
esting and enjoyable affair. The
local lodge of Foresters, which had
previously planned to hold a dance
that evening, postponed It when the
Trades Council's announcement was
made.
Miss Margaret Blackwood of Mud
Bay and Jacob Wendllng of Klober,
were married Monday by Justice of
the Pence Walter Crosby.
