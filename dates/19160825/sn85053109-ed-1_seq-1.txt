Cut Bank to Buzz
During Fall Season
New Elevator, a Modern
Garage and Many
New Homes
Another great grain crop in
the Cut Bank community, with
prices for grain higher than
ever before in the history of
this part of the West assures
for Cut Bauk and this whole
section a continued period of
unprecedented prosperity. With
this stimulus of continued good
times, many improvements and
new enterprises are about to
be initiated and the autumn
will be the liveliest since the
new farming era began.
The Globe Coustruction x
of Great Falls will shortly be*, n
the construction of a 30,000
bushel elevator for the Equity
Society, on ground leased from
the Great Northern west of the
Greely-Schmidt house. The
elevator will cost over $7,000
and will be modern in all de
tails. The contractors have
pledged themselves to complete
the grain house before Oct. 1.
It is given out on reliable
authority that a fourth elevator
will be built here this autumn.
T. J. Larson has just let the
contract for the erection of an
$8,000.00 auto Garage, on a lot
recently purchased from B. J.
Boorman adjoining theBoorman
yard on the east. The Garage
will be constructed of brick and
cement and will be modern in
all appointments. It will be
50x80, with basement, and will
have a modern heating system.
Work on the building will begin
shortly. Mr. Larson has both
the Ford and Overland agencies
and the salesrooms for these
cars will be in the new build
ing.
A number of new homes
will be built this autumn. A
large force of men is at work
on the roundhouse extension.
Cut Bank will buzz with
activity this fall.
Barnett the Man
The Pioneer Press believes
that Mr. John H. Barnett should
be nominated and elected as
county surveyor. It believes
that a change in this office
would redound to the public
good. It believes that a mojor
ity of the people in this north
country who are familiar with
our road matters hold to the
same view. Mr. Barnett is
thoroughly competent to fill
the position. He can and un
doubtly will give us better
service than the preent survey
or, if elected.

RELINQUISHMENTS

REAL ESTATE AND
Miss Cotes Imbued
Miss Cynthia Coles, a bright
and successful lawyer from
Rising Sun. Ind., came out to
Ethridg last spring and filed on
a homestead. Miss Coles com
pletely succumbed to "the lure
of the plains." She is now on a
visit to her old home. In the
following clipped from a letter
to her home paper, she tells
how she had to break a res
olution not to talk too much,
lest the wise heads at the corner
grocery might conclude that
"someone was lyin', gosh durn
it."
"My good resolution to
emulate - the Sphinx was
shattered at the inception. Mr.
Ben Carter, a homesteader near
Ethridge, gave me samples of
his winter and spring wheat,
flax, oats, and timothy, and
their excellence attracted at
tention and favorable comment
all the way down on the train
and even on the bus in Chicago
and so I got 'wound up' and
have talked Montana almost
constantly and displayed the
bouquet to all who would look
and listen.
"Rain has been plentiful in
Montana, hail almost unknown
and the bountiful crop is now
ready for the harvest hands.
Last Sundays Enquirer had an
ad in the R. R. news for hands
to help harvest the crops,
offering to furnish the names
and address of the farmers in
the North West who need help.
"Go west; young man, go
west, continues to be good ad
vice. Montana is rightly named
the "Treasure State" and I
found the climate in summer
ideal and the air drv, light and
invigorating.

Defeat for Devon
Dire things happened at Devon
last Sunday and a heavy haze
of gloom pervaded the High
Line town as the Cut Bank
baseball performers and fans
rolled out of town Sunday eve
ning with an 11-0 victory paint
ed on their pennant. The Cut
Bank pitcher had 14 strikeouts
to his credit and was supported
in major league manner. Devon
was outplayed all the way, so
say the fans from here. Cut
Bank will meet Galata at
Shelby next Sunday afternoon.
Gus Riesel and family are
back to Cut Bank after a 3700
mile trip through the west
coast country and parts of Mon
tana and Idaho. A portion of
the time was spent with old
neighbors in Washington. Gus
declares that in all his trip he
saw no place that suited him as
well for a permanent home as
this section.
Electric Light Matter Coming to the
Fore. Lighting Our Greatest Need.
Council to Act at Monday Meeting
Next Monday evening the town council of Cut
Bank will be called upon to act upon two electric light
franchise applications and to decide whether either
shall go before the people, to be finally acted upon by
the freeholding electorate.
The matter is an important one and very vitally
effects this town's progress and place as one of the
most promising towns in this part of Montana. In
aiding in the solution of this question the city officers
should have the best judgment and counsel of our
citizens.
That the time is ripe for a municipal lighting
system goes without saving. That we deuire that the
lighting system be installed by the most responsible
and efficient agency is a point that will not be debated.
Personal considerations should not enter this question.
We have waited long for this improvement: when
it comes we want the best obtainable.
The Pioneer Press favors the granting of a
franchise to private enterprise, provided a satisfactory
proposition is laid before the council. It will be
impossible for the town to undertake such an im
provement ?t present. The next step in the way of
municipal improvement should be a sewage system.
With another splendid harvest almost ready to
reap, Cut Bank is certainly on the eve of an era of
rapid expansion. New enterprises and homes are
being planned nearly every day. An electric light
and power system will greatly aid in our develop
ment and will attract more investors and more
homemakers. Let us not deter progress by refusing
private enterprise a chance to help itself and help our
town, provided a reasonable proposition is laid before
us. And let us not, in the provincial fear that
"something is being put over on us" be too harsh in
our requirements. Lets give private enterprise that
honestly seeks reasonable returns on such an in
vestment a reasonable chance.
Paris Gibson Declares Farmers Are
Not Getting Square Grading Deal and
Uuges State Grain Inspection Laws
Former United States Senator
Paris Gibson of Great Falls,
who takes keen interest in the
agricultural development of
Montana, is advocating state
grain inspection and classifi
cation. He takes the quotation
in Great Falls on a day recently
as an example of what he con
siders a rank injustice, as
follows:
Wheat: Per bu.
No. 1 hard spring $1.34
No. 1 northern 1.33
No. 2 northern 1.29
No. 3 northern. 1.25
No. 4. northern 1.21
N. 2 hard Montana J.24
No. 3 hard Montana 1.20
Choice No. 4 hard Montan a J. 17
Good No. 4 hard Montana . .1.15
Poor No. 4 hard Montana. ..1 .12
Low grade hard Montana...1.05
Feed wheat. 96
"It will be noticed in the above
list of prices that there is no
grade of No. 1 of hard Montana
and that the price of No. 2 hard
Montana is 10c below that of
Mo. 1 hard spring and 5c below
No. 2 northern, while even No
3 northern is lc higher than our,
No. 2 hard Montana. It seems
strange to me that the rich vir
gin soils of northern Montana's
tableland is not producing hard
Montana of a quaiity equal to
No. 3 northern, while well
matured wheat in Alberta to
the north of us, under the re
gulations of the Canadian
government, grades No. I north
ern.
"It seems to me that the
grading of wheat as presented
Ask to Submit Matter to Arbitration
Leading business interests of Cut Bank this morning
wired President Wilson to accede to the request of the
to our Montana farmers is be
wildering and that in selling his
crop the farmer is completely
at the mercy of the buyer.
What means has the farmer at
his command for determining
the grade of his wheat when
there are a dozen or more
quotations before him, ranging
from $1.05 io $1.34. The grading
of our wheat should receive the
careful attention of our state
government, now that Montana
is taking lier placc as the great
est wheat producing state in the
union. It is evident that the
classification given in the above
market report is made for the
benefit of the buyer, while the
interest of the seller is not con
sidered. So long as human
nature is as we lind it, our
farmers engaged in wheat
raising will never have a square
deal until their rights are prop
erly safeguarded by the state
authority.
"It rests largely with the
farmers themselves whether or
not a proper grain inspection
shall be adopted and enforced.
The farming interests of Mon
iana are now strong enough to
receive recognition from our
legislature assemblies in this
important matter of grain in
spection. The state should
maintain a thoroughly equipped
chemical laboratory at the
capital, where the farmer who
so desires can obtain a correct
analysis of his grain. In doing
this, our state would be simply
keeping step with the progress
ive spirit of the age in which
we are living."
Low Production, High Price
The poor wheat crop that is
general in southern and west
ern Minnesota may be in the
end a blessing in disguise. It
may serve to bring forcibly to
the minds of farmers that it is
not profitable to raise wheat on
land valued at near or above
$100 an acre. It seems that
times has moved southern and
western Minnesota out of the
wheat belt.
The above is taken from the
Glencoe, Minn., Enterprise, a
paper publised in what was
once the grain region of central
Minnesota. The Enterprise
gives voice to a sentiment that
prevails all over that section,
that the day of successful
small grain culture has passed
that it is not possible to com
Dete with the new regions of
tho west, with low-priced land
and high yields. Minnnesota,
is facing a serious problem. The
state is too far north to make
the culture of corn dead sure.
It completely failed last year
and this year the crop is not
od. It is out of the running
as a grain producing state, yet
land is being held and sold for
from $100 to $150.00 an acre,
while Northern Montana land,
which will beat it three-to-one
in grain yields when the season
is half favorable, is offering
opportunities to buy good
farming lands at from $15.00 an
acre up. The truth, as voiced
in the Glencoe Enterprise, is
just dawning on Minnesota
farmersâ€”owners and renters
and Montana will profit by this
tardy realization of the people
farther east.

Harrison Law Man
Visits Cut Bank
Says Cut Bank Has Been
Pretty well Cleared
of "Snow"
Dr. C. A. Hascall, who is act
ing in behalf of the federal
government in the enforcement
of the Harrison Drug Law, was
a visitor in Cut Bank Saturday
and spent several hours with
Druggist W. P. Yunck and the
local physicians.
Through the work of Dr.
Hascall the "dope" cases in
Great Falls were brought before
the federal grand jury and he
has been so active in running
this nefarious traffic to its lair
that there are few persons who
formerly made it a busines who
are reckless enough to persist
at this time. He reports that
the Canadian authorities are
lending their cooperation, yet
there is still some smuggling
across the line. At the present
time there are fifty riders along
the boundary, from Sweet Grass
east and west and woe to the
peddler of "snow" who falls
into their clutches. It will
mean from five to ten years in
a federal "pen." The courts are
constantly imposing heavier
sentences, he says.
Dr. Hascall highly commended
the local druggist and physi
cians. "I find that they are
working most consÃ§ientiously
with us kv^s tamping out dope.
This place was once right in the
center of the underground
traffic, but the work of eradi
cating it has been effective. We
shall keep right on the job until
not a vestige remains" said
Dr. Hascall.
Drowns in Reservoir
Wm. Leonard, aged 56. was
drowned in the reservoir on the
Henry Jacobson ranch last
Saturday evening. Leonard
had been employed on the
ranch a short time and little
was known of him. He was
deserted from the 37th
Regiment, Battalion D, Can
adian troops, and seemed to be
brooding over the fear of
capture, it is said. Chas. N.
Thomas was deputized by the
coroner to conduct an inquest
and visited the scene of the
drowning Wednesday. He de
cided that an inquest was not
necessary. The remains are in
charge of Undertaker Bomboy
and will probably be forwarded
to the former home of the de
ceased, Hamilton, Can.
