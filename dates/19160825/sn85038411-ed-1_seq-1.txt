Sunday School Ruling;
Movies Hit, Too
————————>
Children Forbidden
To Attend Movies
ALL children under sixteen
years are forbidden to attend
moving picture shows or j
other places of public amusement
or entertainment in Pennsylvania
from to-day until after September
18. by order of State Health Com
missioner Samuel G. Dixon this
afternoon. This order supplements
that postponing the opening of .
schools until September 18. as a
precaution against the spread of
infantile paralysis.
All schools —private, parochial and
public—in this city will remain closed i
until September 18. according to the 1
orders issued by State Commissioner
of Health Dixon. This order applies
also to Sunday schools.
Approximately more than 12.000!
pupils will be affected here and city
health and school officials consider
the request issued by the State official
to be the best safeguard against a
big outbreak of the epidemic of infan- ;
tile paralysis.
Teachers of the public schools of
the city will receive pay for the time!
that the rooms are closed by the 1
orders, as State laws provide for this .
in case buildings are shut because of,
disease epidemics.
The City School Board will decide i
next Friday afternoon in regular ses- i
sion whether teachers shall report for '
duty Tuesday. September 5. So far
nothing definite has been decided
upon, however. Dr. F. E. Downes. city I
superintendent, said that the order j
of the State official will be strictly i
obeyed by the local authorities.
Sunday Schools Affected
Sunday schools are also affected
by the order, and will remain closed
beginning next Sunday, until Sunday. !
September 24. A number of pastors
are planning to have the Wednesday
evening prayer meeting topics changed
to the Sunday Schoo' lesson topics'
for the benefit of members of the;
senior department.
Market Square Presbyterian Church
has already issued a notice that the
Sunday School will be closed to all,
departments until Sunday. September :
24, but that Sunday School lesson'
topics will be used for prayer meet
ing talks for members of the senior
department.
Consider Lost Time
Public school authorities have not
considered whether anything will be
done later In the year to make up
the lost time. Some expressed opinions
that time was lost in the Spring be
cause of the local measles epidemic,
and that it would hardly be probable
that holiday vacations would be cut
down.
So far Harrisburg has been im
mune from serious contagion, al
though several cases developed. Dr.
J. M. J. Raunick, city health officer,
however, urged parents again to-day
to be careful and advised them not to
take children to picnics or other big
public gatherings.

i Camp Stewart, El Paso, Tex., Aug.
25.—Twenty-three troopers of the
First Pennsylvania cavalry, many of
them from Philadelphia, are on the
! disability list as the result of attacks
: of vicious outlaw horses.
None of the men are reported to
; be in a serious condition, but all are
suffering from the painful nature of
their injuries, whicn were sustained
1 through bites, kicks and falls.
Five hundred or more horses have
j been issued to the cavalry of Penn
-1 sylvania at the remount stations here
: and the big majority of these are
, not only unbroken, but many of the
animals are actual outlaws,
j Three of the vicious horses killed
I themselves and their riders had
! miraculous escapes, one wild animal
carrying his rider over a five-foot ob
struction. Then the horse struck a
mulu with such force the impact
j killed him.
Officers of the cavalry regiment
stated that none of the men sustained
j injuries of a nature so serious that
they would have to be sent to the
, base hospital at Fort Bliss.
| "Their injuries were treated in the
| regimental hospital." one officer de
i clared, "and most of them were able
to be sent to their quarters on the
disability list."
Limping and bandaged men, how
ever, seen in almost every troop in
the regiment, belie statements that
few of the men sustained serious
injuries.
One non-commissioned officer of a
troop declared to-night that 75 per
i cent, of the men of the regiment had
falls from bad horses.

Hour Day Will Never Be

CONFERS WITH LEADERS
Wilson Sees Brotherhood
Heads; Expression of Optim
ism Not So Free
Washington, D. C\, Aug. 2 s.—The
railway strike negotiations resolved
themselves to-day. outwardly at least,
into a more or less confused state.
Expressions of optimism from both
sides were not so free as they were
yesterday and feeling heretofore gen
eral among the managers that a plan
to include the eight-hour day would
be found was not so evident. Some
of the railroad executives reverted to
their prediction that it never would be
conceded.
President Wilson kept his Cabinet
waiting an hour while he conferred
with the four brotherhood heads.
All parties to the conference stead
fastly refused to say what was talked
about.
Executives Issue Statement
The railroad executives conferred
among themselves during the day and
it was thought possible they might
later go to the White House. For the
executives this statement was issued:
"The executives are understood to
be studying the form of a communi
cation to the President."
Some of the more optimistic still
had hopes of a final decision being
reached before to-morrow night. The
opinion that the eight-hour basic day
will not be conceded apparently was
growing as the conferences continued.
The executives and managers de
voted practically no time to-day to
consideration of freight rate increases
or settlement of future strikes, but
centered on the length of working day
and pay. Many executives are willing
to concede an eight-hour day with the
understanding that it shall not only be
the maximum work day. but also the
minimum: in other words, that .the
present practice by which an employe

Hitchcock Has Plan
to Check Soaring Price
of News Print Paper,
By Associated Press
Washington, Aug. 25. Senator
Hitchcock. Democrat, has prepared an
amendment to the revenue bill intend
ed to check the soaring prices of news
print paper. He said to-day he would
bring it up in the Senate when cer
i tain sections of the bill were reached
i for debate. Mr. Hitchcock is him
! self a newspaper publisher.
Paper selling at S4O a ton and under
' would not be taxed. When the price
! passes S4O a ton a tax of $1 a ton
i would prevail until $45 a ton is
I reached when the tax would increase
!to $o and mount up gradually until
! a tax of S4O a ton would prevail on
[paper selling for more than S9O.
j "My proposed amendment is design
ied not so much to raise revenue,"
I said Mr. Hitchcock, "as it is to make
; it unprofitable for paper manufactur-
J ers to charge exorbitant prices for
, news print paper."

Although the Germans made Sr
