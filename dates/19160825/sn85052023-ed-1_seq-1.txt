FAIR SUCCESS SURE
GREAT CROWD TURNS OUT FOR
THURSDAY'S FINE SHOW
"Weather Is Delightful And Thousands
Come From Far And Near
Winners First Two Days
The Knights of Pythias fair at
"Stanford is a big success this year.
Notwithstanding the drizzle of Wed
nesday which kept the crowd down
to a minimum, Thursday turned off
cool and clear as a bell, and the peo
ple came by the thousands. The
The amphitheatre was filled early
and after that they streamed all ov
er the beautiful, shady grounds and
had a fine-old-fashioned time, meet
ing' and greeting friends and loved
ones. Many who had not been back
to Lincoln county for a score or so of
years, came back to the fair this
week, making it a sort of home-coming
event, and all seemed to enjoy
themselves immensely, meeting old
friends and renewing acquaintances
of years gone by. Friday s weather
conditions would be hard to im
prove upon either, and it promises to
be a record-breaker in point of at
tendance. Thursday's program was a well
balanced one and enjoyed to the full
est by the big crowd. The feature
was the walking ring for mares, in
which about a dozen entries contest
ed. This was won by Deputy Inter
nal Revenue Collector Rowan Sauf
ley with his cracking good black
mare. James B. Leavell, of Bry
ants won the red tie with a mare
belonging to. B. F. Rankin, he com
plete list of Thursday's awards are
as follows:
Wednesday's program was a splen
did one and notwithstanding the in
auspicious start in the morning, quite
a number went out. The stock
show was very good, competition be
ing very keen in many of the rings.
A great deal of interest is attaching
to the show of Red Berkshire hogs,
almost every breeder of this popular
strain having representatives here.
Wednesday was occupied with judg
ing of herds and individuals. Some
splendid specimens of the porcine
family are on exhibition, and the hog
tent is quite a center of attraction.
The colt rings are very good, the
stake being won by T. A. Brent with
his slashing filly by Carroll Bailey's
Rowland Peavine and out of a Bour
bon King mare, taking the blue in
a field of nine entries, with Rowan
Saufley's filly by Ashland Brook,
seccjd. This filly had previously
won the blue in the suckling filly
ring, and is a beauty.
Prof. J. J. Hooper, head of the De
partment of Animal Husbandry of
the Experiment Station at State
University, Lexington, came over es
pecially to judge the milk cow ring.
In this ring the milk is drawn from
the cow on the grounds, and is test
ed by the government expert for
butter fat and other desirable ingred
ients. Rowan Saufley won in this
ring, with a splendid cow with J. B.
Camenisch, first and second. Prof.

One Hobo Was Killed
Another Injured (and Three More
Buried 'In Wreck Near McKinney.
One "hobo" was killed, one badly
injured and three others arc said to
be buried beneath the wreckage, and
22 freight cars and their contents
are piled up in an indiscriminate
mass, as the result of a very bad
freight train wreck which occurred
in the Cincinnati Southern railroad
just south of McKinney, and at a
turn north of South Fork about half
past two o'clock Monday afternoon.
Just what caused the wreck has
not been ascertained as yet and may
not be fully learned for the wreck
age is piled almost sky high. The
train was No. 52 and was running
north at a rapid rate of speed when
the crash came and the heavily lad
en cars piled one on top of the other
in a hurry. Wrecking crews are do
ing everything in their power to
clear up the wreck but traffic will be
delayed for some time on account
of it.
A dead tramp was taken from the
wreckage, and one very badly hurt.
This man said that there were five
of his tribe on the train, beating
their way north, and the bodies of
the other three are supposed to be
under the wreckage as they had not
been found up to Thursday mornine.
Most of the cars were loaded with
lumbar, fruit, and merchandise. There
were several live stock cars on the
train but so far as known no live
stock was killed.

WATCH ME SWIM"
CRIED BABY TO PLAYMATE AS
HE JUMPED INTO LAKE
Infant Son of Judge O. C. Lewis of
Harlan Drowned at Crab Orch
ard Tuesday Morning
Little Billy Lewis, the three-year-old
son of Judge and Mrs. O. C.
Lewis, of Harlan, was drowned in thp
lake at Crab Orchard about half past
ten o'clock Tuesday morning. The
little fellow with a slightly older
playmate. Basil Kenny, went to the
lake, contrary to the wishes of his
mother, and telling his little play
mate that he could swim, jumped off
the landing board, where the small
rowboat used on the lake is usually
kept tied. He floundered about in
the water for a few minutes; then
the Kenny child becoming frightened
ran to a negro man, and told hiia to
come and get little Billy out. as he
didn't believe he could swim, after
all. When the negro reached the
lake, the baby was floating on the
water face downward.
Word quickly spread, and one of
the first to reach the shore was Mrs.
Robert C. Saufley. of Phoenix, Ariz.,
who ran to see if it was one her own
little fellows, when the cry went up
that a child was drowned in the lake.
She reached there as they pulled
the still little form ashore, then wont
for Dr. Strader. who worked man
fully for an hour and a half endeav
oring to resuscitate the child, but to
no avail, for the little spirit had re
turned to its Maker.
The mother, who was at the
Springs accompanied by her older
daughter, and the babv. was pros
trated with grief. Her husband,
Judge Lewis has been on a fishing
end hunting trip to North Carolina
and was summoned by wire.
A SDecial train was chartered to
rarry the body of tne baby back to
its home in Harlan, where it was laid
to rest.
The child, with its playmate, had
begged its mother for some time for
nermission to go down to the lake.
Mrs. Lewis was sitting on the porch
of the hotel with friends, however,
and told the child not to go but that
as soon as she had time, she would
put on her bathing suit and go to the
lake with it. He soon went off. with
the Kenny boy, however, and the
next news a broken-hearted mother
had of it was, that it was dead. The
baby was a great favorite at the
springs, and the hearts of all go oat
to the mother and family in the sad
hour of great affliction thru which
they are passing.
