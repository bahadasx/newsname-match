London Aug. 24. The British war
office reports that tho Bulgarians hava
advanced along the Struma valloy atd
havo entrenched themselves at vari
ous points. Berlin also reports further
advances for them on tho right wing,
where they face the Serbians.
Interest in tho attitude of the
Greeks has been heightened by dis
patches telling of the determination
of the Greek commander at Seres to
resist the Bulgarians and of volun
teers being organized for his assis
tance by the Venizelos leaders at
Salonlkl. There has been no further
development in the Roumanian situa
tion. The last report from Berlin
maintains that Roumania has not
reached a decision.
On the western front the French are
apparently marking time, while tho
British push against Thlepval and
Gulllamont. The war department re
ports a fresh tightening of tho ring
around Thiepval In tho capture of 200
yards of tGerman trenches south of the
town. Bitter fighting is going on in
this section. The Gprman succeeded
In entering some British trenches, but
were Immediately evicted
The fierce struggle around Fleury,
In foe Verdun sector, continue. The
French claim "an appreciable ad
vance" between Fleury and Thain
mont and the capture of 200 prisoners.
Conflicting claims are made by Ber
lin and Petrograd on the fighting on
the eastern front. Both report the
capture of positions near Jablonltza
Pass, where a violent strugglo has
been in progress several days on the
crest of the Carpathians. Berlin also
claims the sanguinary repulse of Rus
sian attempts to cross the StoVhod
and apparently desperate fighting is
going on.
Both Berlin and the war office con
tinue to make claims and counter
claims in regard to the recent fighting
in the North Sea. Berlin admits that
the battleship Westfalen was struck
by a torpedo from an English sub
marine, but maintains that the dam
age was slight. The German admiral
ty reiterates that a British battleship
was heavily damaged by a German
submarine.

Joint Commission Named to Dlseuxir

Lansing and Arredondo Complete
Arrangements.
Washington, Aug. 24. Secretary or
State Lansing and Elisea ArnxlonJa
Mexican ambassador-designate, tenta
tively agreed that the Joint commis
sion to discuss border1 problems
should meet at some place on the;'.
New Kngland coast during tho first
week in September. Brigadier Gen
eral Persh in g transmitted a report say
ing the general opinion was that
"Villa's prestige is gone and that ce
can never again become a serious fac
tor In Mexican affairs."
Supporting, as it does. General
Funston's recommendation for da
withdrawal of the expeditionary forcer
in Mexico, It is believed General
Pershing's report makes it certain;
that the American commissioners ivQl
agree promptly to the suggestions or
their Mexican conferees for tho eariar
recall of tho troops.
Mr. Arredondo called at the depart
ment to receive formal notifications
that the American commissioners bat
been selected and were readr to meet
the Mexican members as soon as tho
time and place could be arranged
Both the embas-sj" and the departracaJr
are in communication with Mex4e
City in regard to the fixing of a date
for beginning the sessions.
The commision as finally selected
is admittedly one of the strongest Coast
yet has passed upon Mexican affairs;
and its personnel is as 'follows:
American section Franklin 13L
Lane, secretary of the Interior; Jngge
George Gray of Delaware, retired febV
eral jurist end since 1900 a member
of the Internationa1 court of arbitra
tion under the Hague convrnttao;

Mexican section Litis Cabrear, 3fer
Ican minister of finance and ono cT
the most powerful reform fcidcrs;
Vgnaclo BoniHas ard A'berfo Pairi,
noted engineers and close friends off
First Chief Carrara
The first task of the commission vrUi
be to decide whether tin Pershing: ex
pedition shall he withdrawal from
Mexico It is considered certain that
this will be acred on speedily. Tt
Is also expected that a neutral aane
will be ebtablirhed early In the negi
tiations. Columbns, Aug. 24. Govcrnor
Willls ordered the state tax commis
sion to probe charges that tho Frank
lin county board of revision had 4"ar
