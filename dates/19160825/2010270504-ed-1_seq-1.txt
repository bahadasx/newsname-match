NORTH PLATTE AS SEEN
BY EDITOR WILL 3lAUl'I.
.
Will Mauptu, of tho York Democrat,
who was ono of tho nowspaper men
who recently visited North Platte, has
this to say in his paper:
I For yoara on end iNorth Platto pco
plo wero content to, alK. around and
'depend upon tho Union 1'aclllc to
'keep tho town going. Tho merchants
wero content with a monthly Union
Pacific pay roll of from $50,000 to $90,
000, and couldn't seo any Use In try
ing to work for something greater.
Bui' a bright light has struck North
Platto peoplo. They now reallzo that
it is posslblo to mako that Union Pa
cific payroll a moro Incident in North
Platto prosperity, and with tho burst
ing of that now light North Platto
Is forging to tho front at a marvelous
rate. Disclaiming any Intent to re
sort to invidious comparisons, I wnnt
to remark that North Platto suffered
from Inadcquato hotol facilities for
many years. When tho now spirit
struck that city It was not necessary
to work and hustlo and beg and
achemo to put a hotel proposition
through. A North Platto man stopped
to tho front and built a modern hotel
that would bo an ornament to any city
of ton times tho .size. A frontier
town? A moro railroad division?
Bless yo, North Plntto's business sec
tion contains moro Imposing business
structures than' any other city In Ne
braska, barring Lincoln and Omaha.
A hugo paving program is undor way.
And, glory bo, that old Union Pacific
depot and hotol burned down a fow
months ugo and tho Union Pacific is
now getting rondy to build a now hun
dred thousand dollar depot and di
vision headquarters.
