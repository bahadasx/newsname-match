CRITICALLY ILL WITH
RARE TROUBLE.
Jo Lang, of Ashland, aged twenty
years, son of Jacob Lang, Is cii'lcally
ill with purpea hemorrhagic, a ver
rare disease, and his death Is ex peer-1
at any time. The blood oozes from h
skin and he is bleeding into the boar
els and the kidneys. Recoveries from
the disease, the cause of which Is not
known, are very few.
NOISY AUTOMOBILES.
There are a few fellows hem, and
only a few. we are glad to say, who
seem to take special delight In making
ail the noise possible with automobiles
when driving on the streets of Louisa.
Apparently, they want to attract at
tention. It Is a genuine nuisance, as no
conversation can be made Intellleible
near them. In the business plsces ev
erybody must cease conversation until
the nuisance, gets by. In churches and
other public congregations the distur
bance is serious and most annoying. On
the 4th of July this nuisance was espec
ially trying. In all cities and nearly all
town ordinance have been enacted
ajrainst this abuse and -this should be
d L.a:isa. We notice where a fine
f Ave dollars and rwrrs was inflicted
upon a man in Ashland Tuesday for
this offense.

Another thing that goes against the
grain of the old guard Republicans is
that Sampson Is one of Caleb Powers'

to lessen car shortages the Chesp.peake
Ohio railway company has appealed
to Ifcrards of Trade, other commercial
organizations and shippers and re-
ceivers of freight generally, for' co-op
eration In its efforts to secure the max

cars of all classes. The demand for cars
is far ahead of previous years and the
Interstate Commerce Commission has
sued a circular letter to carriers and

threatened shortage In the Criited
States and urcing that shippers secure
prompt and full loading of cars and
