SEEM OBDURATE
Wilson Appeals to Chiefs to
Accept His Plan.
Washington, Aug. 22.-As one Amer
ican citizen to another President Wil
son appealed to each of the executives
of the country's railroads on grounds
of principles to accept his plans for
averting the threatened disaster of a
nationwide strike.
He emphasized the necessity for
keeping the railroads in service as a
part of the national defense and to
1H te possible preparation for meeting
cc :odliLions that will exist after the lu
roptean war.
On leaving the White Hoite the rail
ruad presidents, augetnuted by arriv
1il front the West, held a coIf r nen
at which sentiment was said to be
against agreeing to the president's
proposal in its present form.
dope was expressed, however, that
some satisfactory counter proposal
might be advanced and it was decided
to turn over to a committee the task
of drafting a final reply to the presi
dent.
With more than sixty men, most of
them with their own ideas about what
ought to be done, the executives found
it difficult to "get down to brass
tacks," as one of them expressed it.
Another meeting will be held and
every effort will be made to reach a
decision promptly.
The railroad heads still insist that
President Wilson is asking them to
sacrifice the principle of arbitration.
Elisha Lee, chairman of the national
conference committee of railways, is
sued a statement in which he said:
Statement by Chairman.
"That the railroads should grant,
under threat of a national strike, a
$50,000,000 wage preferment to a small
minority of their employes without a
hearing before a public tribunal, is in
conceivable in a democracy like ours.
"All questions at issue-wages;
liours, costs, operating conditions
are submerged by the greater issue:
Shall arbitration be abandoned in the
settlement of industrial disputes?"
The statement suggests, however,
that the railroads stand ready to take
whatever action the people and the
coumtry desire. It concludes:
"The weight of public opinion must
determine this issue. We cannot be
lieve that it is the calm judgment of
the country that we should sacrifice
the principles of arbitration In indus
trial disputes under a threat to tie up
the commerce of the country."
While the officials were listening to
President Wilson and, later conferring
at their hotel, the general committee
of 640 representatives of the employes,
who already have accepted the presi
dent's plan, held a perfunctory meet
inc and marked time awaiting the de
cision of the employers. They said
they would wait until President Wil
son dismissed them, but stood ready
to cll a strike should the negotia
tione fall.

CUTTING SIZE OF MENUS
increasing Cost of Paper Affects New
York Hotels.
New York, Aug. 22.-Because of
scarcity and high cost of paper one
of the leading hotels here announced
it would reduce the size of its menu c
cards, beginning Sept. 1.

a similar course.
The hotel which has taken the first
step will distribute less stationery to
its patrons in .the future.
Those wishing to write letters in the I
writing room will, be required to ap
ply to the desk for paper and envel
opes.

MILES ROMNEY IS MAKING
STRONG RACE FOR GOVERNOR
Miles Romney is making a strong
race for the democrotic nomination for
governor. He is out in a lengthy state
ment defining his attitude on state is
sues, in which he charges the present
administration with many shortcom
ings, among which is that of adding
many high salaried officers, extrava
gance in all departments and without a
single constructive achievement.
He offers a definite program which
he pledges to fulfill, if elected. His
pledge is filed in the office of the sec
retary of state and is as follows:
"If I am nominated and elected I
will, during my term of office, deem it
my first and highest duty to give full
force and effect to the will of the peo
ple, as reflected by majority vote. I
would put into immediate and effective
operation the law providing for loan of
permanent state funds on farm mort
gages, enacted nearly two years ago
by over seventeen thousand majority.
And, if prohibition or any other state
measure be enacted, I will enforce, up
hold and protect the law. I would di
vorce state schools from machine poli
tics and favor adequate workmen's
compensation and a constitutional con
vention. "
He says further: "This convention
should be composed of the biggest and
best minds from every county in the
state, vested with authority to draft
a twentieth century constitution for
Modern Montana. thus providing the
quickest agd most effective way to
equalize the tax burden, abolish a horde
of useless and costly offices, promote
social justice and take such action as
may be necessary to curb monopoly."
E. F. TABOR DIES
IN ST. IDNATWUS HIOSITAL
The whole Flathead commun
ity was surprised to learn on
Monday last of the death of E.
F. Tabor at St. Ignatius, on the
evening before. His death oc
curred at the hospital in that
town, following an operation for
appendicitis.
Mr. Tabor has been the pro
ject engineer of the Flathead
since the commencement of the
work, and was probably known
to more people here than any
other man on the Flathead.
He went to the hospital last
Friday and was operated on, but
the disease had gained so much
headway and his whole system
was so poisoned that medical and
surgical aid was of no avail. It
was found that he was suffering
from a ruptured appendix and
the end came on Sunday evening
between eight and nine o'clock.
He was a native of Rhode Island,
51 years of age, but most of his
life had been spent in California.
He entered the reclamation ser
vice eleven years ago and had
been connected with some of the
largest government projects.
He leaves a wife, son and
daughter to mourn his death, and
many friends in his official and
social life who deplore his de
parture. The funeral was held
Wednesday morning at 11 o'clock
at the Methodist church in St.
Ignatius, and interment was
made in the Protestant cemetery
F at that place. The funeral ser
vices were attended by many
beople from all parts of the
county.
Reclamation Contract
Sealed bids will be received by the
reclamation service at St. Ignatius up
to Sept. 20, for the excavation of 125,
000 cubic yards of earth, 495 cubic
yards of reinforced concrete, 1,000
square yards of paving, 10,100 square
feet of canal lining, manufacturing and
laying 3,400 feet of concrete pipe, lay.

"MY GOOD MAN, DON'T YOU EVER FORGET ANYTHING?"
STATE CAN DI DATES
Senator Edward Donlan was
in charge of a party of state can
didates who visited Ronan Tues
day afternoon. The party con
sisted of Hon. Albert J. Galen,
candidate for governor, Hon.
Dan Boyle for railroad commis
sioner and Andrew J. Guenther
for state auditor. They inter
viewed almost every one in Ro
nan and distributed their cards
as they went about.
Mr. Galen has been attorney
general of Montana for eight
years and is considered one of
the best attorneys in the state.
His announcement caused his
friends in every hamlet to sing
his praises and take off their
coats and work for him. Prob
ably no man has as many per
sonal friends as Albert J. Galen
and he is considered as having
the best show in the fight#
Dan Boyle has been railroad
commissioner before and seeks
election at this time on his re
cord. Personally he is very
popular all over the state and
the vote he received two years
ago indicates that he will be the
nominee of the republican party
this year.
Mr. Guenther lives in Butte
and has been engaged in busi
ness in that city several years.
His qualifications entitle him to
consideration.
From here they went to PoI
son and from there to Kalispell,
intending to close the campaign
in Sanders county Monday.
Fred Potvin was in Missoula
Tuesday and took with him a
pair of shoes of a lot number
identical with the shoes found on
the feet of one of the men ar
rested in Spokane, suspected of
the Poison safe blowing. The
sheriff compared the shoes and
they correspond exactly in every
detail with the shoes of the Ro
nan Mercantile Co., whose safe
was blown a few weeks previous
to the Polson jobs. Shortly after
the safe was blown here, Frank
Menager discovered three empty
shoe boxes on their shelves and
as it had not been their practice
to place empties back on the
shelves, they suspected that
some shoes had been stolen at
the time of the safe blowing.
The shoes worn by two of the
men arrested are of the same
make- and lot number and this
points strongly to them as being
the ones who blew the safe here.
FARMERS REPORT
BIG WHEAT YIELDS
s Threshing is being done all
- over the valley and the yields re
ported show an increase over ex
pectations and seem to indicate
that there will be more wheat on
k the Flathead this year than last.
r A trip southwest of Ronan was
made Wednesday evening and a
stop made at Dave Morris' who
s had just finished threshing an 80
acre field. The road takes off a
t portion along the side and across
f the end and the machine meas
. ure gave him 2451 bushels, or an
B excess over 30 bushels per acre.
( The wheat berry is plump and
r sound and will grade No. 1. Mr.
. Morris has an 80 acre field of
. Marquis wheat almost ready for
i cutting which gives promise of
doing much better.
Henry Fleisher, who is operat
1 ing his threshing machine west
and norths e st of Ronan, was in
- town yesterday and reports the
wheat turning out good, and
I gives a few of the yields as fol
lows:
A. Fraser, 27 bushels per acre;
C. E. Caffery, 30; Chester
Mauthe, 20; Erick Johnson, 20;
F. Hendel, 18; Stanislaus Otto,
18. The last four being wheat
stubbled in last fall on new
breaking, which never gives the
yield the second year as summer
fallowed land. All the wheat is
of No. 1 grade, however.
With wheat bringing over
$1.25 per bushel, there should be
lots of money in the country this
Lfall.
According to a news dispatch sent
out from Great Falls under date of
August 23, the United Mine Workers
of America in convention at that place,
adopted resolutions denouncing Gov
ernor Sam V. Stewart for his stand on
the law providing for the appointment
of a deputy state coal mine inspector
and on the state farm loan law. The
resolution declares "that in refusing to
put into effect the above laws, he has
proven himself unworthy of the support
of organized labor and the farmers of
the state." The resolution also reads
to "use all means at our disposal for
the defeat of S. V. Stewart, who is a
candidate for governor on the demo
eratic ticket."

BROWER ELECTED PRESIDENT
OF FLATHEAD COUNTY BANK
This week Senator A. J. Brower,
president of the Ronan State Bank,
purchased the controlling interest in
the Flathead County State Bank of
PoIson, and at a meeting of the board
of directors was elected president and
director of that institution.
With a million dollars or more in the
reclamation fund unexpended with
which to push to completion the irri
gation project of the reservation; with
the establishment of a sugar factory in
Missoula which will ultimately bring t
factories in this country; with a rail
road about to be built from Dixon t
through Ronan to Poison, which means
an expenditure of lbetter than a million
dollars; with one of the best crops that
this country has ever produced now be
ing harvested and grain at the highest
price it has been in sixty years, and t
with cattle and hogs selling at a good
price, it is his opinion that the whole
Flathead reservation is entering upon
a period of prosperity and glevelorment '
and he has concluded to take advantage d
of these abnormal conditions. r
The fact that Mr. Brower has be- a
come associated with one of the grow- t
ing and substantial banking institutions c
of our neighboring town on the north, r
does not mean that he is going to with
draw any of the financial support which C
he and his business associates have c
given to this country for several years. 0
He will still continue in active charge
of the Ronan State Bank and give the
majority of his time to that institution.
The Flathead County State Bank, its f
officers and directors, are to be con
gratulated upon being, able to obtain I
Mr. Brower as their president and to t
acquire his financial assistance and s
banking judgment.
SENATOR BROWER LEASES
FARM TO BEET EXPERT
Senator Brower has leased his
farm northeast of Ronan to Peter
Scarpin of Sterling, Colo., an ex
pert in the growing of sugar
beets. Mr. Scarpin comes on the
recommendation of R. M. Barr,
the Great Western Sugar Co.
agriculturist, and will bring four I
men with him. It is the inten- I
tion of Mr. Scarpin to plant 40
acres of beets next year and will
thoroughly demonstrate the fer
tility of the land as to its sugar
beet growing properties. He
says it will require the four men
to do this work in the manner
he desires it done, as it will be
largely experimental. There is i
no doubt, however of the success J
of the venture as Mr. Barr has I
made a thorough analysis of the t
soil of the Flathead and is con- I
vinced beyond question as to the
result once sugar beets are
planted.
In this connection it can be
said that the Great Western
Sugar Co. has announced its in
tention of building a sugar fac
tory at Ronan just as soon as the
acreage can be secured to war
rant the building of same. That
Ronan is the logical site for at
factory on the Flathead has been
conceded ever since the officials
made the inspection trip over the
valley before deciding to build
at Missoula. It is centrally lo
cated in the heart of the largest
to-be-irrigated district in the
west and this fact makes it ab
solutely certain that here is
where the next factory will be
constructed.
Joe Meingassner was in town I
Wednesday morning from his a
ranch east of the Nine Pipe res
ervoir and reports the late rains
as having been of great benefit r
to all late sown wheat and oats t
in his neighborhood. He says r
the yield will have been increased t
many acres per bushel.
A. J. Brower made a hurried
business trip to Spokane Tuesday
night, returning home yesterday
morning.
ROUMANIA AGAIN
IN SPOTLIGHT
Balkan Nation May Join the
Entente Allies,
London, Aug. 22 -The opening of
the allied offensive at Saloniki has
been the signal for renewed reports
that Roumania at last is about to
throw in her lot with the entente.
These reports are more circumstantial
than before and German press com
ments indicate that they are far fronm
being devoid of foundation.
One 1Perlin newspaper declares that
Roumania already has joined the al
lies and that plans are being laid for
the march of a IHussian army through
IRoumaiian territory.
Major u loraht, the German military
critic, also bAieves that Roumania is
negotiating with Russia and hints at
an ultimatum to Bucharest from Ger
many and Austria.
The entry of Roumania into the war
on the side of the entente would mean
the forging of another link In the
chain of foes surrounding the central
powers.
The material aid which Roumania
could give would be of an imbortant
character. She has had between 500,
000 and 600,000 troops mobilized for
nearly a year and her army is reput
ed to be one of the best equipped and
trained In Europe.
Apart from possible Russian rein
forcements Roumania would be In a
position to deal a powerful blow at
Bulgaria from the north in conjunc
tion with the allies' drive from the
south.
It has been generally understood
that Russia has been willing to con
cede the province of Bessarabia, the
population of which Is largely Rou
manian, in return for Roumanian co
operation in the war. Bessarabia is
18,000 square miles in extent and has
a population of nearly 2,000,000.
BRITISH AND FRENCH
ADVANCE IN BALKANS
London, Aug. 22.-Tn the Balkan of
fensive launched Sunday from Saloni
ki over a front of 150 miles the Brit
ish and French, advancing on the right
have crossed the Struma, pushing
northeastward towards the Bulgarian
frontier. At the same time the Ser
bians, who have opened a drive for
Monastir, Deport the capture of Bul
garian first line trenches.
On the extreme left, however, im
mediately south of Monastir, they
have suffered a reverse and have
evacuted the Greek town of Vanica.
Reports from Saloniki say that Ital
ian troops have landed there and will
join in the general offensive.
At certain points on the front Ber
lin reports the Bulgarians on the of
fensive, but London and. Paris inter
pret this as a move for political pur
poses. A desire to affect public opin
ion in Roumania and to influence the
approaching Greek elections is believ
ed to be the motive behind Bulgaria's
aggressive action.
Fierce fighting continues In the re,
gion of the Stokhod, on the eastern
front, where the Russian advance men
aces Kovel and the German salient at
Pinsk. The battle on the crest of the
Carpathians also rages.
On the western front there has been
no material change in the situation
Hinfe the allies started their great at
tack. German counter attacks made
at several points along the British
lines, according to London, met with
nou successr.
The Germans also have made a pow
erful effort to recapture Fleury, in the
Verdun sector, but Paris reports a
complete repulse.
BRITISH DEFEAT GERMANS
General Smuts Continues Active In
East Africa.
london, Aug. 22.-British forces in
German East Africa have forced a
passage of the Wami river and are ap
proaching the important town of Ki
lossa, says a war office statement is
sued here.
"Lieutenant General Smuts reports
the British, advancing from the Ngura
mountains, encountered at nightfall of
the 16th a strong enemy force holding
the passage of the Wami river on the
road to Nrogoro," the statement says.
"Fighting continued till the night of
the 17th, when the enemy retreated."
With Russians fighting in France
Germany may have enlarged her ac
commodations for war prisoners to
meet what she expected.
