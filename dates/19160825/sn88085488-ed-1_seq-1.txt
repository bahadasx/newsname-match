Citizens Will lie Given Opportunity to
Voice Sentiment* on October - —
Last Year's Levy 21 -Mills
i
t
A city tax levy of 23 mills, or two
mills higher than hist year, will be
required to meet the operating ex
penses of the city of Pullman during
the year DMT. according to the bud-;
get prepared by city officials. The
budget will come up for hearing at
the council meeting of October 2,
when citizens will be given an oppor
i,
tunity to express their sentiments in |
regard to the 'estimates, pro and j
] con. The budget, as prepared, shows
a total amount to be raised by taxa-
I tion for all purposes of $23,040, as
against a total of $21,200 for this;
i year, or an increase in estimated ex-1
penses of $1840, which will make j
I necessary the added two-mill levy. [
The biggest increase occurs in the j
items for current expenses, the total
estimated expenditures in excess of j
the receipts for next, year being $15,- j
200, as against $12,500 for the pres
ent year. The cost of labor for main- j
tenance of streets and sidewalks will;
call for an outlay of cash consider
| ably greater than that for the present
year, the other Items under current
expense being practically the same.
The water fund is expected to take
!care of itself. $10,000 being estimat
ed both for receipts and expenditures.
The amount estimated to be raised
by taxation for the current expense
I fund is $15,240, as against $12,500!
I for last year: the Indebtedness fund
i calls for $6000 as against the same
' amount as last year, and the bond

Four Hundred Socks or Wheat De
stroyed Through Smut Fire In
C. .1. Krouse Machine Wed
nesday Evening
— i
The first separator fire of the sen- 1
! son in the vicinity of Pullman oc
icurred Wednesday evening at 5:00
o'clock when fire in the C. .1. Krouse
machine, caused by smut, resulted
in the destruction of 400 sinks of
j wheat and approximately 700 empty l
I sacks. The fire started near the cyl
inders and almost instantly was car
| ried to the straw stack. The separ
ator was equipped with a steam fire
'extinguisher system and ii blower for:
: preventing the spread of the smut
dust. There was no perceptible ex
; plosion but the fire started with a
fury that almost instantly carried it
jto all parts of the machine and!
I through the blower to the stack. '
The steam extinguisher system
'worked perfectly and the flames in I
! the machine were soon extinguished,
| the damage to the separator being
I reduced to a minimum.
Each member of the crew had been I
assigned to some particular task in
j case of fire, but the efforts of the
men failed to keep the flames from
spreading to the pile of sacked grain
and practically the entire setting was
destroyed, together with a quantity
!of empty sacks. Jack Brown, one of
the sack sewers, was overcome by
the smoke and heat after fighting
! the fire valiantly, and was brought
| to Pullman for medical attention. He
soon recovered and will suffer DO ill
I effects. Lee Stone, the other sack
sawer, also suffered from the smoke. f
The machine was operating on the j
| Krouse farm, seven miles west of i
Pullman, In wheat that was prob
i ably 20 per cent smut. The de- j
stroyed wheat and Backs were fully
! covered by insurance. The separator
has been rejaired and the crew will
again start operations today.

i.e<i Russian wheat #1.12
Club wheat #1.15
Fortyfold and Bluest em #1,17
Bailey, per cwt #1.00
Oats, per cwt #1.32
As the harvest operations near
Pullman become general, the grain
quotations are advancing with start-
I ling regularity and steady gains
have been made each day. the biggest
increase being that of Tuesday, when
a five-cent raise was recorded. Yes
terday's quotations were practically
the same as those of Wednesday, al
though some dealers were offering
slightly better figures than the day
before. There appears to be little
disposition on the part of the farm
ers who have not already contracted
10 sell and small sales, mostly under
1000 sacks have been the rule (lur
ing the week. Many farmers are
selling just enough of their wheat to
tide them over and holding the bal
ance in anticipation of still better
quotations.
Yesterday's best quotations, as
given above, show an advance of 15
cents in wheal during the week, the
greatest advance made during the
same length of time this season. Bar
ley and oats have figured in the ris
ing market and yesterday's quota
tions on these cereals showed a sub
stantial advance over those of last
week. According to experienced
grain men over one-half of the new
crop is already contracted for, and
sales are expected to pick up as soon
las the new wheal begins to come in
| in quantity.
! Harvest in the vicinity of Pullman
I is on in earnest and while threshing
! has not yet advanced to a point to
give a conservative index to the gen
eral yield, many fields are running
better than expected and 40-bushel
crops are reported from every direc
tion. The first threshing was done
Monday, when four outfits took to
the fields, and others have started
operations on each day since. There
appears to be no scarcity of harvest
hands, and wages are practically the
same as those paid last year. The
combined machines which are oper
ating in the Snake river district are
experiencing trouble with the green
straw, which is much less brittle
than in ordinary years. This condi
tion was caused by the late spring
rains. The straw shows a tendency
to wrap itself around the working
j parts of the machine, clogging the
I parts and making frequent stops
necessary.
FUNERAL OF KM. K. P. ALLEN
Scores of friends of the late Mrs.

brought to Pullman from Colfax on
the 4:30 train and was escorted to

|W. R. C. and G. A. R. The services
I were conducted'by the Rev. J. H.
ißainton, pastor of the Colfax Con
gregational church, and Mrs. Allen's
I favorite hymns were sweetly sung
! by a quartet composed of Mrs. J. R.
Stephenson, Miss Blanche Gallley, E.
W. Thorpe and B. F. Campbell. The
beautiful floral tributes bore mute
I but touching evidence of the high es
teem in which Mrs. Allen was held
