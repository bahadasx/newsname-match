Pres't Wilson and th. presidents
ami managers of the various rail
ro.uls of the country in an effort to
prevent a general strike will not
recede from their acceptance of
Pres't Wilson's plan to end the -.n-troversy.
Put under tio circum
stances will they make any further
concessions to the railroads.
Pres't Wilson was so informed by
th erand t!icers o!" the brother
hoods at the conference in the white
house today which lasted for one
hour and minutes. While Iiis cab
inet members "cooled their heels"
outside his study tin president dis
cussed the entire situation with the
brotherhood leaders, seekine to lind
whether there was not some other
compromise plan that could be
agreed upon which would force a
speedy settlement.
The brotherhood men told the
president that they anl their asso
ciates had accepted his plan of an
eieht-hour work day on a 10-hour
basis of pay in so od faith, abandon
ing all collateral considerations, in
cludiie the demand for overtime,
and that they must now stand pat.
If the roads will not yield, they
said, there was nothine for the men
to do hut. order a general strike.
Hohl Soorct Conference.
While the brotherhood men con
ferred with the president the man
agers and executives of the rail
roads held their first secret confer
ence in their headquarters in the
Willanl hotel.
The conference betwa-en the pres
ident and the railway union chiefs
was reported to have been some
what animated. AH of the brother
hrod representatives united in tell
ine the president that the nülro;uls
had eone to "the most unfair"
lengths to manufacture apparent
sentiment throughout the country
against his proposed basis of set
tlement. In proof of this t hareo
W. (. Ixe. president of the lirother
hood of Trainmen, filed with the
president copies of a teleeram from
P. T. Sawdy of Spokane. Wash., de
claring that J. L. Derorce, superin
tendent of the Northern Par itie, had
sent all agents of that road a mes
saee ordering them to have as many
farmers, stock raisers, dairymen
and merchants in their district wire
the president demanding that he
insist that all of the questions now
in dispute, including hours and wa
ges, he settle! by arbitration ami
that he abandon his own proposal
of settlement.

The message also said:
These telegrams are t be juiid

of the prominent sieners senl mes
s;.ee to their coneressmen and sen
ators in Washington in adlition to
those sent to Pres't WiNon. This is
ery important and must be u'iven

le tohl the president that this
proved conclusively in his opinion,
that the messa ces rea'hine Wash
