HUGHES' DATES
GIVE HIM ONLY
TWO DAYS REST
Continuous Speaking Tours
Planned for G. 0. P. Nomi
nee With One Exception.' '
HE THINKS HE CAN DO IT
Candidate Is Physically Fit and
Does Not Fear Strain of
Strenuous Work.
By PERRY ARNOLD.
LARAMIE, Wyo., Aug. 25. Ex
cept for two days' rest at Bridge
hampton, L. I., immediately at
the conclusion of his present trip,
Republican Nominee Hughes-will
be continuously on speaking tours
from now until election time.
According to tentative plans
which have been forwarded to the
candidate, Hughes will set a new
record in campaigning 'if he is
physically able to follow out the
itineraries prepared for him.
Today the govrnor thought he
would be able to go through, be
cause he was feeling so fit. It is
the nominee's hope that he will be
known personally to a majority of
the voters of the United States.
HEARD BY 1,000,000 PERSONS.
By the time he has finished his pres
ent trip he estimates he will have
been heard by about 1.000,000 persons.
As arranged today, the nominee will
conclude his present tour by a speech
at the Syracuse State fair on Orange
myrSeptember II. He will then re
turn direct to Brldgehampton, re
maining there not more than three
days before swinging out again.
En route from Kentucky to Maine
Hughes will have a thlrty-mlnute
wait between trains at Cincinnati,
September 6.
Ohio Republicans are endeavoring 10
arrange for a mass meeting at the rail
road station.
The first speech on Hughes' Invasion
of the down east territory will occur,
according to plans, at York Harbor, on
the afternoon of September 7.
That night he will speak at Portland.
On September 8 It Is planned to have
htm apeak at Lewlston In the morning;
at Watervllle In the afternoon, and at
Bangor at night.
This would leave him two days before
speaking at Syracuse on the llth.
It Is probable the two days will be
occupied by a brief awing Into Massa
chusetts and Connecticut.
To Close November 4.
On November 4 Saturday night before
ths election the nominee will conclude
his campaign for the Presidency by ad
dressing a mass meeting at Madison
Square Garden, In New York city.
Hughes la exceedingly anxious to
make a visit to the Texas border, and
possibly campaign a little among the
soldiers.
Hughes' one set speech of today was
aohaduled at Cheyenne lato this after
noon, but he mado a couple of brief
talks at various' smaller cities en route.
The theme on which ho dwelt with most
emphasis In all these speeches was
the necessity for unification of effort
and co-operation of endeavor in Gov
ernment. The slogan, "America first and Amer
ica efficient," seems to have made a
hit with "Western rtepubllcnns. This,
the tariff, and Mexico were the subjects
of Hughes' address at Salt Laka City
last night.
Hughes spoke in the Mormon taber
nacle. He Is the third candidate for
President of the United States to bo ac
corded this distinction In recent years.

German Liner Runs
Gauntlet of Allies
Patrol Along Coast
Willehad Puts in at New London After Open Sea
Trip Along Coast From Boston Expected to Be
Mother-Ship for Submarine Liner-Bremen.
NEW LONDON. Conn.. Aug. 25.
Nosing her way through a fog while
a little tug puffed and snorted along
side, the North German Lloyd liner
Willehad swung in to the pier of the
State Ocean Steamship Company here
today, adding another chapter to Oer
man defiance of the allied warship
patrol off the Atlantic coast.
Customs officials and all New Lon
don believe the coming of the Wille
had forecasts early arrival of the mer
chant submarine Bremen from the
German port of that name. The Wil
lehad made the trip from Boston
without escort.
Coming through the Cape Cod canal
and thence out to open sea, the liner
traversed more than fifty miles of her
Journoy through a xone in which she
was subject to attuck or capture had
enemy warHhlpH sighted her. She
went out beyond tho three-mile limit,
but was not molested.
May Be Another Ship.
It Is believed here the Willehad Is to
sorve In the same capacity for tho Bre
men as the Neckar, interned at Balti
more, did for the Deutschland. The
Bremen's cargo will probably be trans
ferred to the Willehad, which will act
as a "mother ship" for tho submarine,
housing her crew while they aro In
port, and protecting the submersible
from enemy eyes. As the Deutschland
wao nestled close to the Neckar, with a
protecting tug on the opposite side, and
a wall and bargo. acting as barriers
at either end, so Is the Bremen ex
pectud to bo warped snugly Into the
pier alongside tho Willehad.
There Is, as yet, no positive Infor
mation as to when the Bremen will
arrive, but all Indications are that
she will nut In at this port.
Off Manomct point tho Willehad
sighted a suspicious looking craft
heading toward her, and she chose a
course near the shore. The Wllle
had's pilot had received orders that
If approached by hostile craft, she
should be beached.
The Willehad Is the first Interned

dered the Bulgnrtans to discontinue their
advance Into Greece and to evacuate oc
cupied Greek territory, fearing Greere
will be drawn into the war. according to
an unconfirmed wlrelers dispatch from
Rome today.
Haveral Greek generals have refused to
obey orders to evacuate eastern Mace

the dispatch said. Instead of retiring,
they have prepared to defend the east

The Greek government Is said to have
laid this Informurlon before Germany,
adding that public Indignation over the
Invasion has Increased to such an extent
that the government Is no longer master
of the situation. Upon receipt of this In
formation Germany ordered the Bulga

en to Enforce Vote.
For the first time since the nego
tiations were started, eleven days
ago by President Wilson to effect a
settlement of the dispute between
the railroads and the brotherhoods,
the possibility of a strike loomed
up menacingly today in official cir
cles. The entire situation is critical,
and far more so than it has been
at any time since the President
summoned the representatives of
both sides to Washington.
This afternoon the President will
receive the representatives of the
railroads, who are expected to take
to the White House some kind of a
definite response to his proposals
for a settlement.
The railroad executives, who
went into session at 1 1 o'clock, ad
journed at 1 o'clock, without reach
ing a decision on a proposal to be
submitted to the President. They
will meet again at 3 o'clock. What
was considered at the two-hour
meeting was not announced. A

sound them on the posslb.lltv of con

Employes Growing Restless.
In the meantime, the emploes
throughout the country are beginning to
grow restless. Telegrams are being
received from local brotherhoodo
demanding that the negotiations be
brought to a close or that a strike be
called. This attitude Is being reflected
among the C40 brotherhood chairmen
here, and difficulty Is being experi
enced by tho leaders In hokllng them In

The President Is bellovcd to have dlo
cussed the situation today with his
Cabinet, only three members of which
attended the meeting. None of them,
however, would volunteer a prediction
as to the outcomo of the negotiation,
although heretofore all of them had
been optimistic that a settlement would
be reached
The brotherhood men while at the
White House, placed before the Presi
dent the charge that a nation-wide lobby
Is being conducted to Influence senti
ment In favor of the railroads. They
presented telegrams to show that the
Northern Pacific railway is paying for
favorable messages forwarded to Wash
ington. The following message, the brother
hood heads said, was sent by Superin
tendent J, L. Laforce. of the Northern
Pacific, to all agents of his road:
"It Is highly Important to get train
men question discussed by farmers,
stock-raisers, dairymen and merchants.
Please get as many of these classes
as possible In your town nnd vicinity
to send telegrams rush to President
Wilson at Washington, urgently re
questing him to settle tho controversy
by arbitration.
"Telegrams should show business of

I want you to send copies of these

When shown a copy of the message
purported to havo been Hent by Su

Pacific, to all agents, (J. S. Hlade, vice
president of the Northern Pacific,
said:
"I never heard of the sending of

''Do you know of nny campaign to
