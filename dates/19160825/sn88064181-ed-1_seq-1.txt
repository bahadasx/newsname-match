IDuring the last trip of the labora
tory car of the Louisiana State Board
of Iiealth, beginning in April, 1045
samples of water from every quarter
of the state were collected and sub
jected to a bacteriological test.
The process of discovering the qual
ity oI tle water supply throughout the
state, inaugurated by Dr. Dowling, is
the first, of the kind to be started in
this country, through Kentucky some
time ago made an investigation of
the same nature, but by no means as
far-reaching. The laboratory . car
runs to every quarter of the state and
when stops are made an automobile
is unloaded and proceeds through the
country, collecting- samples of water
from streams, wells and sources of
communal supply. The sampling of
the water from a well, at first glance,
affects only the residents of the far'm
stead, but the scource of the supply
in the neighboring farms is probably
the same, and if the water be good
there is a probability that the wa
ter from the other wells In the
neighborhood is also good, unless
there is immediate contamination. If
the supply should prove to be bad, the
neighboring farmers are at once put
ton their guard and can send In a sam
':p1 o'th heir .7,0 for analyste:
The analysis made is bacteriologl
cal only, every form of organic life C
being examined by careful test. The
result has not yet been announced,
but the compilation is in progress and f
will soon be published by the state 1
board. Some of the communal sources
of supply have been found to be Im
pure, and the board has notified the
local authorities and directed the
proper method of purification.
There have been cases decided In
the North in which the municipal gov
ernment has been held responsible for
the effects of impure water, and in
some cases criminal prosecutions
have been successfully launched
against the municipal officials. Before
the present investigation is conclud
ed examinations will have been made
of. from ten to thirty samples from
every parias qf the state, and a good
idea will be had of the water supply
of every family in Louisiana. Where
the water is found not to be potable
the supply will be condemned by the
state board and notices will be post
ed warning the public against drink
ing, and if the water is consumed the
person drinking it will do so at his
own risk and with open eyes.

Republican governor had his head

and the location of many proud homes.
was named.
The old house had been :standing
for many years when Governor Allen
and his official family lied from New
Orleans after the Northern invasion.
No one seems to know who the origi
nal owner of it and the broad acres-
now covered with comfortable homes
-was, but it at once became the
scene of many a distinguished gather
ing and brilliant revue.
When order was restored to Louis
iana, Governor Allen vacated the
place to go to Mexico rather than
take the oath of allegiance required of
those of the South, and the property
passed into other hands and was suc
cessively the home of many families
prominent in North Louisiana, the
Conways and the Coles and the Hbur
rays among them.
With the growth of the city Allen
dale was deserted for newer and more
fashionable districts, and the old
house gradually fell into bad repair.

Recommendations to continue cat

police jury after the hearing of ar
guments pro and con on the dipping
situation. The audience of over 500
was a representative one composed
of farmers, stock men, representative
citizens, planters, merchants and
bankers, the threatened abandonment
of dipping having aroused within them
the niecessity' of concerted action.
The protestants with their attorney,
Emile Vuillemot, were also present in
large numbers.
Morse, Etherwood, Midland, Gasp

only exception being Branch, where a
four-mill tax vote was almost defeat

teen against. The property valua
tion-of the twenty was worth $25,000
more than the minority vote. The
vote is remarkable, as these elections
are for special taxation over and
above the regular school tax.

REMAINING TROOPS
TO STAY IN CAMP
ORDERS SENDING THEM TO THE
BORDER HAS BEEN SUSPEND
Washington.-Orders for the re
maining mobilized units of the nation
al guard to proceed to the border
have been suspended by the War De
partment. No official explanation has
been made, but it is known that the
delicacy of the railroad strike situa
tion has been the moving considera
tion.
The suspension of the orders to the
troops, which would have moved some
25,000 men to the border should not
be taken as an indication that the
president's negotiations with the rail
road brotherhood and the railroad
managers have taken an unfavorable
turn, but is a measure of caution. It
was considered highly undesirable
thqt all the remaining guardsmen
should be moved to the border while
there was a possibility of a railroad
strike in which they might be called
upon to preserve order throughout
some of the states. There is even
the possibility that some of the
troops, in the event of a strike, might
be called upon to guard or operate
mail trains and trains supplying the.
troops already on the border. a
The suspension of the orders pre
vents the immediate movement of the
troops from Kentucky, Ohio and Ver
mont, and the movement of all other
mobilized units which were to have c
gone forward as soon as they were
equipped. Some of the Kentucky,
Ohio and Vermont troops were about
ready to go to the border.
It is clear that the suspension is
not a revocation of the orders, and
that if the railroad strike situation
clears up the troops will be moved to
the border line.
Women Favor President.
Chicago.-Huston Thompson, as
sistant attorney general of the Unit
ed States, who went to Denver as the
representative of President Wilson to
attend the annual dinner of the Jane

2 BRITISH VESSELS
SUNK, SAYS BERLIN
ER SENT DOWN BY GERMAN
SUBMARINE.
TWO OTHER WARSHIPS HIT
German Squadron of 15 Warships Re
.parted at Large in the North Sea
Avoided. Engagement After
Finding Out Strength.
London.-Two British light cruis
ers, the Nottingham ana Falmouth,
were sunk in the North sea by Ger
man submarines while the vessels
were searching for the German high
seas fleet, according to an official an
nouncement issued by the Admiralty.
One German submarine was destroyed
by the British, while another was
rammed and possibly sunk, according
to the Admiralty statement.
A German squadron of 15 warships,
including large cruisers, was reported
in the North sea by trawlers arriving
at Ymuiden, Holland, a Reuter dis
patch says. The squadron was sight
d early in the region of White Bank,
nd was accompanied by two Zeppe
ins. It was on a northwesterly
course.
The Admiralty statement says:
"Reports from our lookout squad
rons and other units showed that
here was considerable activity on the
)art of the enemy in the North sea.
"The German high seas fleet came
iut, but learning from their scouts
hat the British forces were in con
Jderable strength, the enemy avoided
;n engagement and returned to port.
"In searching for the enemy we
5st two cruisers by submarine at
tcks-H. M. S. Nottingham, Captain
. B. Miller, and H. M. S. Falmouth,
asptain John Edwards.
"All the officers of the former were
ived, but 38 of the crew are missing.
i1 the officers and men of the Fal
puth were saved, but one leading
sker, Norman Fry, died of injuries.
'An enemy submarine was destroy
e and another was rammed and pos
ssy sunk.
'There is no truth in a irerman
saement that a British destroyer
f sunk and a British battleship
ditaged."
t'he Nottingham was a 'ssel of
500 tons, and was built in Pem
like in 1913. Her complement was
3 men. She was 430 feet long and
dried nine six-inch guns, four three
1inders and wo torpedo tubes. She
v3 designed to make about 25 knots.
Must Have Reparation.
London.-In the House of Commons
1mier Asquith said the government
letermined that "this country will
Stolerate a resumption of diplomat
relatlons with Germany after the
ir until reparation is made for the
prder of Captain Fryatt."
SAYS DEUTSCHLAND
ARRIVED UNHARMED
GIANT SUBMARINE EVADES BRIT
1SH BLOCKADE AND LANDS
Geneva.-A private telegram receiv
ed from Berlin by the Neue Zuricher
Zeitung -says that the German sub
marine Deutschland arrived safely at
Bremen from the United States.
The Deutschland sailed from Balti
more for Germany on August 1, and
passed out to sea on the following day,
dropping out of sight of the allied
warships which were awaiting her
outside the three mile limit. On July
9 the Deutschland arrived at Balti
more from Germany, and the success
ful completion of the first trans-At
lantic voyage by a submarine in ser
vice as a merchantman attracted
world-wide attention. She brought a
cargo of dyestuffs and other merchan
dise, as well as mails.
As soon as her arrival was made
known French and British warships
were sent to patrol the waters out
side the Virginia capes, in the effort
to apprehend the Deutschland If she
should depart for a return voyage.
Saw Deutschland.
Newport News, Va.-The captain of
a Norwegian steamer, which arrived
in Hampton Roads, stated he saw the
German merchant submarine Deutsch
land August 10, then eight days out
from the Virginia capes.
He said the submersible at the time
was under full sail, and the officers
aboard admitted it was the Deutsch
land.
Wilson Writes Emperor.
London. - "Berlin telegrams say
that the American ambassador, James
W. Gerard, asked an audience of Em
peror William to hand him an auto
graph letter from President Wilson,
In which the president outlines his
wishes concerning the feeding of the
population of Poland," the Amsterdam
correspondent of the Exchange Tele
gram Company says. The letter is be
lieved to be of high political import
ance, though no mention is made of
an offer of mediation.
Old Paper Prices High.
New York.-The paper famine was
reflected in an auction sale here of
old paper by David Ferguson, super
visor of the City Record. One lot of
9,000 pounds, composed of unsold
copies of the City Record brought
$1.65 per hundred pounds. Another
lot of unsold paper, weighing 6,000
pounds, brought $2.60 per hundred.
Normally sales of such paper bring
from 20 cents to 50 'nts a hundred.
Wilson Considers Trip.
Washington.-President Wilson is
seriously considering a transcontinen
tal campaign trip. Callers at the
White House gained the impression
that he had decided on such a step,
but officials said that his plans for
the campaign still are uncertain, and
depend largely upon Congress
ITALIA ti JIN IN
WAR AT SALONIKI
JOIN BALKAN FIGHT -- ALTER
NATE GAINS AND LOSSES ON
THE ENTIRE FRONT.
SAYS OFFErNSIVE IS GENERAL
Allies Are Believed to Have a Force
of Some 700,000 British, French and
Servian Troops on the Sa
loniki Front.
Paris. --talian trIops began to dis
embark at Saloniki, says a liavas dis
patch from that point.
On leaving their ships, the dispatch
says, the Italians passed through Sa
loniki to camp, preceded by military
bands of the allies and cheered by
the populace.
Active participation by Italian
troops in the Saloniki campaign would
mean the existence of a state of war
between Germany and Italy.
Germany is directing the opera
tions against the allies on this front
and, as the official German reports
show, has forces there. Some Aus
trian troops also probably are em
ployed, and possibly Turks, but the
major portion of the army is made
up of Bulgarians. Recent reports
have indicated withdrawal of Aus
trian troops at the Balkans for use
on the Russian and Italian fronts.
As the allies are believed to have
a force of some 700,000 British, French
and Servian troops on the Saloniki
tront, the sending of re-enforcements
at this time, just after the opening of
hostilities on a large scale, would in
dicate that the allies have embarked
on a campaign of extensive propor
tions.
Italy, which has a considerable nr.
s -tofltrofops,-'has e4tn Enged to tLke - -
a more active part In the Balkan ope
rations, but was believed to have re
frained partly on account of the fact
that she was not at war with Ger
many. There have been several re.
cent indications, however, that a de
claration of hostilities was forthcom
ing. A commercial treaty between
these nations was abrogated, a Ger
man court ruled that Germany is act
ually, though not formally, at war with
Italy, and last week it was reported
that the defense of Triest would be
taken over by Germany. Italian par
ticipation in the Balkan operations
hitherto has been limited to occupa
tion of the Albanian port of Avlona,
which was effected before Italy de
clared war on Austria.
Denies G. O. P. Charges.
Washington.--The White House
made public a letter from Charles M.
Galloway, acting chairman, of the Ci
vil Service Commission, denying as
sertions of the Republican platform
that the Democratic administration
has created 30,000 offices outside the
Civil Service law, which cost $44,000,
000 a year.
May Probe Bread Case.
Washington.-Whether there shal:
be a federal investigation of the high
cost of flour and prospective increases
of bread prices depends largely upon
the report of Commissioner Hurley,
who is in Chicago making informal
inquiries for the Federal Trade Com
mission.
Guests' Escape is Narrow.
Chickasha, Okla.-Several guests of
the Royal hotel had narroe escapes
when the structure caught ire and
was destroyed. An explosion in the
kitchen was given as the cause of
the blaze. The hotel was the first
built here and was one of the lann
marks of the city.
Favors Special Stamp.
Washington.-The House Postoffice
Committee took favorable action on
Representative Harrison's bill author
izing the issue of a special stamp In
connection.with the Gulfport Exposi
tion next year to commemorate the
centeniary of the admission of M1,
sissippi to the Union.
Death Rate Decreases.
New York.-The Department of
Health reported a decrease of 20
deaths from infantile paralysis, com
pared with th~ precedIng 24-hour pe
riod, and also a drop of 26 in the
number of new cases. The day's fa
talities were 22 and there were 143
new cases of the disease.
Health Meeting Called.
Washington.-The federal Publie
Health cervlce asked state health s
thoritiecs throughout the country to
send representatives to a conference
here to discuss means for preventing
a further spread of infantile paralyral
