U. S. Sends Notes to France
and England to Reconsider
Refusal of Safe Conduct.
Associated Press Service.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 20. Tue
United States has sent rotes to Great
Iiritain and France, it became known
today, requesting reconsideration by
those governments of their refusal
to issue a safe conduct through their
blockade lines for Count Tarnowski,
the new Austrian ambassador to this
country, and speaking of the unfor
tunate effect that a continued refusal
would have on opinion here.
The notes point out that it is an
inalienable hight of sovereign na
tions to exchange ambassadors and
insist that a third person, even in
time of war, is not Justified in deny
ing that right.
Great care is taken to base the
representations solesly upon the
grounds of international right as
distinguished from mere internation
al courtesy, making it clear that the
United States is not asking a favor
or assuming the attitude of a plead
er. ('arc also is taken not to put the
government in the position of having
changed its attitude since the last
communication on the subject, which
was merely the transmission of the
Austrian government's request; for a
safe conduct. It was planned at
first when the rebuff was received, to
drop the position of being a mess
enger of Austria and make formal
demand in the name of the United
States.

by the ,r; graduates of Indiana's

but young and old. married and
sinule. they were none the less
proud of the fact that they were the
members of the first chess that ever
worked in a vocational school In

The mo.'t interesting feature of
the "commencement", were the
contests, corn raising, bread baking,
and biscuit making conte.-ts. Mrs.
Clem Godschalt won th.e biscuit mak- t
ing content but she must share the
honors of being the champion baker

were taught cooking and sewing
while the boys were tauuht the busi

practical subjects as the use of fer

of the course on the farm and it
combined practical demonstrations
