Japan Harbors No Thought of War With
the United States
O ] o
IT is evident that cci tain persons and their followers in the United
J States are nt present doing all they can to create fear and suspicion
of Japan. Notwithstanding that Japan has never acted in any ag
gressive or belligerent manner to give ground for such surmises, these
detractors of Japan kc p up their campaign.
Although our relations with the United States during the last ten
years have not been wholly satisfactory, we have nevertheless remained
friendly toward the American people. Our attitude has always been con
ciliatory and sincerely peaceful.
In regard to the California question Japan has amicably endeavored
to meet America more than halfway. and she still trusts to the wisdom,
reason and SENSE OF JUSTICE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SEE THAT JUSTICE IS DONE TO
WARD JAPANESE SUBJECTS IN THE UNITED STATES.
Although, so fur as Japan is concerned, the immigration question
is nt rest, certain American politicians are still busy with immigration
bills at Washington, aimed chiefly at still further exclusion of Japanese
subjects.
JAPAN' 3 ONLY DESIRE IS THAT HER SUBJECTS IN AMERICA
SHALL RECEIVE THE FAIR AND EQUAL TREATMENT ACCORDED ALL
OTHER ALIENS.
