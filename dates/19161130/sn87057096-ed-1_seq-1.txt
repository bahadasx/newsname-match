POSTMASTER RESIGNS
Mrs Caroline Young Smith Has Re
signed as Postmaster of Leon,
effective December 15th.
rt
The news leaked out last Wednes-
day evening that Mrs. Caroline
Young Smith was going to reBign as
postmaster of Leon, and it created
considerable comment. A few per
sons had known for several weeks
that she was going to resign, but
they were pledged to secrecy. This
resignation will end one of the most
bitter postoffice
fightB
ever witness­
ed in Iowa. We have had conslder
Able to say in regard to this appoint
ment, which attracted state wide at
tention. Mrs. Smith has resigned,
and so far as we are concerned the
matter is ended, comment being un
necessary.
Mrs. Smith's resignation was sent
to the department on Monday of this
week, and an active contest for the
-appointment as postmasfor to fill
the vacancy haB commenced, there
being two active candidates in the
field, E.- E. Beck, of Leon, and M. F.
Springer, of Center township, who is
the democratic county chairman.
.Several dark horses are talked of,
but none have as yet announced
themselves. We will be satisfied
with any good democrat who resides
here. That is all the editor of The
Reporter ever contended for-, and we
believe we were right in our light
against, the present postmaster's ap
pointment.
Mrs. Smith's resignation tells her
side of the story and is as follows.
Leon, Iowa, November 27, 1916.
To the Honorable Postmaster Gen
eral, Washington, D. C.
I hereby tender my resignation as
postmaster at Leon, l»wa, to take ef
fect on uecember 15, 1916, and I
-trust I may be relieved of my duties
upon that date.
I desire to express to you and
your associates in the department
my sincere thanks for your uniform
courtesy and kindness. While my
duties have been arduous, I have
enjoyed every minute of my ser
vice, and I would not asked to be re­

BUN OVER BY AUTO TRUCK.
Harold Peters Falls Under Wheels of
Heavy Loaded Track, and is
liadljr Injured.
A distressing accident occurred
last Friday morning on the depot
hill on south Main street when Har-
old, the seven year *old son of Sher
Z7 man Peters, fell from an auto truck,
th wueei8
passed over him,
breaking his right leg between the
knee and hip, and tearing the
muscles apart in his left arm, which
will probably cripple him for life.
The freight truck of the Leon Bus
and Transfer Co., with Roy Wood as
driver, was coming up from the de
pot with a load of 3,800 pounds on
it. The Peters boy and another
youngster climbed on the truck un
known to the driver, and when part
way up the hill the Peters boy fell
off. The driver knew nothing of the
accident until tlie' other lad told him
Harold had been run over, and he
stopped the truck and ran to the
boy's assistance. Harold while
moving around on the truck lost his
balance and fell off, falling under
the rear wheels, which passed over
both his hips and his left arm, in
flicting the injuries above describ
ed, and how he escaped from being
crushed to death is a mystery, as the
truck had an extra heavy load on it.
He was aiso badly bruised. Dr. Bow
man was summoned and gave the lad
attention, and he is getting along
nicely and will recover in time.
This accident should prove a
warning to a number of boys who
have been in the habit of jumping
on the auto trucks, -and is not the
first time a boy has been hurt. The
driver cannot see them, and in this
case no blame can be attached to
him. Parent^ should caution their
children in regard to this matter.
Scott—McClaran.
A very pretty marriage ceremony
was solemnized Sunday at high noon
which united for life Miss Una Mc
Claran and Erald Scott, two of Davis
City's most popular and highly es
teemed young people. The ceremony
was witnessed by only a few rela
tives and close, friends of the con-
Teale and the groom by Deane Gates
Following the congratulations a
three course dinner was served.
The bride is the eldest daughter
of John McClaran and is a charming
and accomplished young lady, unas
The groom is the only son of Mr.
and Mrs. Carter Scott and a fine
young man in every way, of sterling
character and attentive to business.
He is a pianist of ability. After
graduating from the city schools he
went into business with his father
and they enjoy a thriving trade in
the grocery and hardware business.
Mr. and Mrs. Scott will make their
home in this city and begin their
voyage through life with the bright
est of prosepcts^md with the good
wishes of a host of friends.' The

Some strange things happen at a
railroad station when a train hap

passengers are waiting. Last Fri
day the train from the SQuth was an
hour or more late. Among the per

traveling man who had drank
enough prohibition whiskey to make
him think he was the most impor

into the agent's ofBce and inquired
if the K. & W. train would wait at
Humeston for the train. Agent
Ketcham told him he was just ask
ing them over the wire and that it
would not wait. The aforesaid t.

kicked and kept on talking about
being unable to get a civil aqswer
from a railroad man, and asserted
that is was impossible for the agent
to have asked and received an
answer from Humeston in that
length of time. The matter was ex

would not be satisfied with any

day" Next Monday.
The Paramount feature play for
Friday at ^he Idle Hour theatre ia
"The Majesty of the Law," preBent-
J. Carmean has purchased the Jjng George Fawcett supported by an
all Btar cast. The story follows:
Belonging to one of the finest
families in Virginia, the son of old
Judge Kent of the circuit court, and
betrothed to beautiful Virginia Fair
fax, young Jackson Kent had every
thing before him. When the pearls
stolen at Col. Monroe's ball were
found in his overcoat pocket and he
would make no explanation Jack
son's future was blasted. He left
the county seat and was not heard
of again until his indictment in Ev
ansville for embezzlement from the
local bank. It did not help him any
that his father by the irony of fate
.should sit on the case rather made
it harder. Judge Kent imposed the
maximum sentence, ten years. The
spectacle of the father on the bench
forced by his sense of honor and
duty to sentence his own son was
one of the saddest sights in the his
tory of Evans county. The unravel
ling of the tangle and the discovery
of the real culprit gives the county
seat a chance for rejoicing. If you
enjoy a play with heart interest,
love, honor and duty all rolled into
one you will be sure to see "The
Majesty of the Law."
The Monday feature play in which
Daniel Frohman presents Mary
Pickford in a different screon por
trayal as "A Girl of Yesterday,"
produced by the Famous Players
Film Co. is a unique romance of the
past and present. The story follows:
"A Girl of Yesterday," one of the
most novel screen offerings ever
presented, is the first motion picture
romance to embody all of the phases
of courtship of a generation gone by
in contrast with the most modern
of romantic auxiliaries—the aero
plane, the palatial steam yacht, the
tennis court, the golf links, and
many other adjuncts of present day
sport. As the prim and unsophisti
cated reincarnation of our grand
mothers ,and laier, as the center of
attraction in the modern world of
society with all the pomp and luxur
ies ol' tlie elite of today, Mary Pick
ford achieves an unusual double
triumph. In the course of the pro
duction Glen Martin, the world fa-
lmous aviator, makes his first ap-
