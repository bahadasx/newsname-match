FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THE
VALUE OF NORTH AMERICAN
RAW FUR COLLECTION
Fifty million dollars worth ot raw
furs. Quite a large sum of money -when
you come to think about it. This is a
normal season's production of North.
American raw furs.
Can you imagine fifty million dollars
changed hands for North American raw
furs? Yet such is the case as near as
can be estimated by Mr. A. B. Shubert,
president of A. B. Shubert, Inc., Chi
cago, U. S. A. (the largest house in the
world dealing exclusively in Amerian
raw furs). Mr. Shubert says: "The
merry old world still goes around and
the coming of winter brings on one
more raw fur season. It is one of the
oldest industries known to man, dating
back even before the time of Qhrist,
and in spite of the fact that millions
of fur-bearing animals are killed off
every year in spite of the fact that
rigid game laws are enacted to-protect
the fur-bearers, the game is far from
being extinct.
It is wonderful the part that furs
have played in the history of man.
They have caused wars, led to the ex
ploration of new lands and changed
the maps of nations, but more wonder
ful still are the varied fluctuations
in the market. It is the greatest specu
lative game in the. world. When the
raw fur market is at its highest pitch
Wall street fades away to nothing
alongside of it. Before people knew
what steel and tobacco were, they were
skinning fur-bearers for their pelt and
still the game has not died out, in
fact, this season promises more activ
ity than ever in the fur business.
Furs are an absolute necessity as
they form the protective clothing of
those whose occupation brings them in
contact with the elements of winter.
Furthermore, furs are extremely fash
ionable. Milady's wardrobe is not com
plete without most of her outer gar
ments for fall and winter her hat
evening gown and dresses trimmed
with fur, and it is not uncommon to
see shoe tops, handbags and parasols
trimmed with fur.
