ON THE B"S1NES3 PREACHER.
" '
The recent confession ot Dr. Newell Dwlght Hlllia
from the pulpit of the Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, that
he erred In becoming secular is In many respects the
most important statement made from the American pulpit
in this generation and if it marks the high tide ot min
isterial lust for worldly power that has been flooding this
country for the past Quarter ot a century then Dr. Hillis
has not erred in Tain.
It must be said to the credit of this noted divine that
his purpose in stepping out of the pulpit was to acquire
the means of rendering a more capable service to those
who need and deserve assistance, but the pathway from
the pulpit to the world is always strewn with good inten

tions. Satan knows as well how to tempt a saint as he does a sinner
and he has lured many a minister down the primrose pathway ot worldly
power to ruin, tor no one knows better than his satanic majestr how easy
it is to get a preacher to enter business or politics "in the name ot the Lord."
- The laymen ot this nation have viewed with alarm and the world with
derision, the growing tendency of ministers of the gospel to abandon the
pulpit as a power against evil and seek the influence ot worldly agencies
to put into effect their Christian ideals. The man who has not sufficient
faith in the power of religion to grapple with the sins of this world ought
not to be in the pulpit and if he wants to accumulate wealth in order to
relieve poverty or wield a scepter in order to enforce morality, then he ought
to be a banker or a mayor, instead ot a preacher.
The two great temptations that confront the Christian ministry today are
business and politics and between the two evils, Dr. Hillis chose the least
and by his able conduct has turned error to his credit and transgression to
the advantage of the pulpit. It is no compliment to say a preacher is a
sharp trader or a smooth politician and certainly no applicant for the min
istry would otter such qualifications as evidence of equipment for Christian
work, and ministers engaged in undue activities in either field become a
menace to the church and a peril to the state.
It is true the ministers, as a class, are underpaid, but their average In
come will exceed that of the average fanner. Stocks and hnnrta. land and
securities, politics and the lecture platform have tempted many a preacher,
but the plow handles are without sin so far as luring the minister from the
pulpit is concerned. Any preacher who feelB the inclination to abandon the
pulpit should plow a few rounds and I venture the suggestion that he will

Now that Dr. Hillis has led the business preacher "back to the pulpit"
will some one of our leading political preachers confess their sins and lead
weir waywara brethren back to the fold? -

Truth is something infinitely great

fact; it is anything which records,
reflects or symbolizes not only life
as it Is, but life as it ought to be, and
as hopeful faith believes it sometime,
somewhere will be the opening of a
window toward Heaven. Caryl B.

Granite for Road Surfacing.
(Farmington Times.)
The writer was out motoring last
Sunday afternoon with an observant
friend who is familiar with road con
ditions all over the county. Passing
over Stono and along the road to Iron
Mountain, the wealth of granite stone
is very noticeable. "What a pity,"
he remarked, "that our County Court
can't see the wisdom and economy of
crushing this granite stone and sur
facing our roads with it, instead of
the rotten lime stone that is being
used for this purpose and which is
continually being ground to dust and
swept away by wind and rain, so that
the roads are continually needing
patching up an expensive proceed
ing in the long run.- ibis granite
would make roads that would last and
cost little to keep up."
We were impressed with the sug-
gestion,and were told that be had more
than once urged this matter on the
County Court, but that that body had
so far taken no action upon the sug
gestion. Whether this is because of
some idea of false economy and that
it would add too much to the cost of
road building because of the distance
the material would have to be hauled
to some points, we do not know. Of
course the cost would be a little great
er, but when the advantages to be ob
tained, the solidity and permanency
of the roads are taken into considera
tion, would it not be economy in the
long run?
But Stono and the long stretch be
tween Doe Run and Iron Mounta'n are
not the only places In the county ricb
in granite formation. Splendid gran
ite quarries are also to be found all
around Enob Lick. Not knowing
much about what wonld make good
road material, we suggested to our
friend that the Hardness or granite
and the rough edges of the material
would increase the wear and tear of
vehicles, and especially of the rubber
tires of motor cars. But that, accord
ing to his theory, wonld be no greater
than results from crushed lime stone,
and it soon wonld become so com
pact and smooth as to Sweep asido
such objection.
John E. Franklin and C. E. Marsh are In
dicted.
(St. Louis Post-Dispatch.)
John E. Franklin, president of the
defunct Bankers' Trust Co., and
Charles S. Marsh, who was secretary
of the company, have been Indicted
by the Federal grand Jury, it was
learned to-day, on charges arising
from the company's collapse two and
one-half years sgo. The Indictments
were returned last Saturday, bnt were
withheld from publicity at that time,
wttb a view to getting service on the
Indicted men.
Although the Indictments have not
yet been made publlo, It is understood
thatone covers the general operations
of the Bankers Trust Co. and that the
other contains specific allegations of
fraud in connection with the financial
associations of the Bankers Trust Oo.
with the First National Bank of Little
Rock, Ark., which failed shortly after
the oollapse of the Bankers Trust Vo.
The Bankers Trust Co. was a holding
company, owning stock in a chain of
country banks throughout the Middle
West. It had no depositors.
The indictments follow an extended
investigation by Postoffice inspectors
Into the use of the mails in the busi
ness transactions of the Bankers'
Trust Co. The company had a pro
prietary interest in a cbain of rural
banks in Missouri, Arkansas, Okla
homa and Texas. At the time of its
failure, it was found to have been bor
rowing heavily from these banks.
The stock of the company fell from
S190 a share to 870, on the market,
within five weeks, and within three
weeks more it went down to $39. It
was charged, at that time, that ' the
stock had been inflated in value by
the payment of dividends which had
no basis in earnings of the company.
Suggested Changes in Postal Rates.
Washington, November 25. The
ways are now being greased for the
launching of the. movement for the',
readjustment of postal rates in the
next session of Congress. This prob
lem was to have been taken up in the
last session but had to be deferred on
account of the consideration required
by railway mail pay. Since "this has
been disposed of the committees are
prepared to take up the matter of
placing the various postal rates on a
moreequitable basis.
A zone system of rates for second
class matter is being prominently
urged to take the place of the present
flat rate Which was adopted nearly
forty years ago. The present rate
has for some time been regarded as a
discrimination against the newspapers
in favor of the great national maga
zines. Like the parcel post the pro
posed zone rates would be based on
the length of the haul.
The postal committees have been
besieged by petitions bearing millions
of names and several hundred thous
and letters from individuals urging a
readjustment of postal rates with a
view of making possible one cent let
ter postage. A survey of the situ
ation Indicates that sufficient changes
will be made in the various rates to
permit the granting of a 1 cent rate
on local delivery letters in the next
session of Congress.
ChaUman Moon of the House Postal
Committee, to-day said: "I think
that the Committee will take up this
second 'Class mall matter at the neat
session and press it to a conclusion at
once. While I cannot speak tor the
Committee, this is my desire in the
matter. I do not know what kind of
a bill we will pass, whether It will
have a zone feature attached to it or
not. This view has been presented
frequently in years past, and some
times received favor and sometimes
not. As to what shape the legislation
will be in I am not able to say, but I
am sure the Committee will give it
the best possible shape in the public
interest."
Commenting on the proposed
changes in the rates on letters, Con
gressman William P. Borland of Mis
souri, said: "In view of the persist
ent and general demands being made
by merchants and small users of the
mails for a more equitable adjustment
of the letter rates of postage Congress
would be justified in taking some
definite action this session on the
propostiou. It has aiways been my
belief that the cost of transportation
should have some bearing on fixing
the various rates of postage. The
special local rate, as proposed, would
be a great boon to the small business
man as it wonld be the means of open
ing up an additional patronage, al
though the benefits to be derived by
the average patron of the Bervice
would be proportionally great."

Spell It Out
An exchange carries the informa
tion that the post office department
has made a new ruling with regard to
the addresses on letters, to the effect
that the names of states shall no long'
er be abbreviated but spelled out in
lull. This will prevent much of the
mishandling of important mail matter
and greatly lessen the labor of postal
employes on trains and la the various
offices, " '
Abbreviations of suoh states ss
California and Colorado, Maine and
Missouri, etc., are very similar, es'
pecially when written but in long
hand, and quite often mail is serious
ly delayed by reason of the address
being misread and (he matter dls
patched wrongly. When the writer
was postmaster at Var Buren, as an
instance, scarcely a cUy passed when
from one to a half dozen letters were
not received which should have gone
to Van Buren, Maine, and often a let
ter intended for Van Buren, Arkansas.
Spell it out and insure prompt and
proper handling of your mail.
Live Stock Fair at Chicago.
At the close of the world war now
in progress in Europe, the live stock
business of the United States will face
its greatest era of prosperity. The
reason for this is evident, for before
agricultural activities can be renewed
on the devaated farms of war-ridden
Europe, those farms must be restored
with horses and all kinds of breeding
stock, which the ravages of the war
have so materially reduced in num
bers. Where will Europe go to suppy this
demand for horses, cattle, swine and
sheep? Who can supply these units
so necessary for profitable agricul
ture? America, and America only.
And, to meet this demand for breed
ing stock, it behooves the American
live stock farmer to begin at once his
preparations to have his Btock in
shape to stand inspection of foreign
buyers who will scour this country
when Europe lays aside the sword to
take bold of the plow handles once
more.
Duriug the first week or December,
there will be held at Chicago, Illinois,
the largest exhibition of horses, cattle,
swine, and sheep in this country, and
possibly the largest in the whole
world. It is the International Live
Stock Exposition,- where more than
4500 pure-bred fat animals, foremost
representatives of all the well known
breeds of horses, cattle, swine and
sheep, will face the judges in competi
tion for a fortune in prizes. Classes
of individuals, herds, and carload lots
will be shown, and champions and
grand champions chosen.
What is the meaning of this great
gathering of domestic animalsthjs
aristocracy of the animal work
to exhibit before the eyes ot t
lie the choicest product of
breeding, to bring forth the
pieces of men who have made
rency
breeding their life-work.
What does it do for the fortunate
visitor and spectator? If he has a
breeder's love for animals, it cannot
fail to awaken in him a desire to im
prove his work. The 6ight of these
excellent individuals is enough to in
spire anyone with a desire to produce
even better ones.
... Even for one who is n'at rtujii'y a
breeder of live stock, the Interna tion
al is well worth visiting. It affords
an opportunity to get away from
home, Bee some of the world outside,
and become acquainted withyonr dis
tant neighbors. See what the other
fellow is doing to make a better world,
and iucidentally pick up some point
ers on animal breeding, which are
bound to be circulating where so many
experts are gathered. Take your
wife, daughters and sons along, make
it a vacation trip forthe whole family,
for you will find entertainment for
all at this show.
Reduced railroad fare will be in ef
fect from all points to Chicago, which
affords everyone an opportunity to
see the big city on the lake as well as
this greatest of live stock exhibits at
reduced expense. Ask your local
agents concerning these rates.

Many a strong man and many a
healthy woman has much for which
to thank mother. The care taken dur
ing their childhood hrough; tbem past
the dancer point and made them
healthy men and women. Thousands
of children are bothered with incon
tinence of urine, and inability to re
tain it is ofttimes called a habit. It is
not always the children's fault In
many cases the difficulty lies with the
kidneys, and can be readily righted.
An Ironton mother tells how she went
about it.
Mrs. Anderson Host, Ironton says
"One of my children suffered from
weak kidneys and was caused much
annoyance by too frequent passages
01 the kidney secretions, especially
at night. I doctored the child and
tried a lot of remedies bnt with no
benefit. Finally Doan's Kidney' Pills
were tried and they gave wonderful
relief. This medicine regulated the
kidney action and deserves endorse

Obituary.
Died In St. Louis, November 12,
1916, Murtie B. Sloan (nee McCabe)
wife of W. A. Sloan, and daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. O. McCabe of Granite
ville, Mo. She leaves a husband, two
children, a father and mother, two
brothers and one sister, together with
a host of relatives and friends, to
mourn her departure.
She was a devoted wife, a kind and
affectionate mother, and a friend to
all. To know her was to love her;
with a kind word and pleasant smile
she greeted all. After a brief illness
of but a tew short days and the mes
senger of death came on a hasty Sab
bath mission claiming the soul of a
dearly beloved mother and severing
forever the tender tie that binds the
child to home, robbing the fireside of
its richest treasure. How uncertain
indeed is life and how sure is death.
"Watch therefore for ye know not
what hour your Lord doth come."
When all had been done that loving
hands could do we leaned by faith on
the unseen hand of Him who said,
"Lo lam with yon always even onto
the end," and in humble submission
said, Thy will, O Lord, be done, like
Job of old; the Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away,' Blessed be the
name of the Lord.
Weep not dear one as those who
have no hope; behind this dark cloud
of bereavement he hides a smiling
face. Dear children, though you have
no longer a mother's tender counsel
nor her loving watchful care put your
trust early in Jesus who promises to
lend a listening ear and remember
the cries of the orphans. She was laid
to rest in the Middlebrook Cemete ry
to await the Resurrection morn, where
parted friends again shall meet.
Dearest mother, thou hast left us,
And thy loss we deeply feel,
But 'tis God who hast bereft us
mon'. He can all our sorrows heal.
