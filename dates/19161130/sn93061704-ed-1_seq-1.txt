3,000,000 POUNDS
Of BEANS SHIPPED
Three million pounds of Frijoles!
That is the record, according to our
count of the amount of beans shipped
from Mountainair this season. There
have been seventy-five cars of 40,000
pounds each, representing a cash value
to our people of practically $200,000.
This is double the number of cars
shipped from here last season. And
there are quite a few beans still left in
the vicinity. Some are threshing and
will be for several weeks yet. The total
shipment of beans from this point will
easily reach one hundred cars, with a
value of between $350,000 and $400,000.
A car of lumber heavy timbers
was shipped to Roswell yesteiday, and
two more cars loading with lumber
now.
One car of cord wood was taken out
the first of the week, and two more are
now loading.
The Mountainair Produce Company
received a car of alfalfa this week,
finishing unloading yesterday.
J. A. Copeland has receivtd word
from Mrs. Copeland that her mother
passed away a few days ago. Mrs Cope
land was able to be with her some time
before the end came.
ENTERTAINMENT
A SUCCES
The Riley-Thanksgivirg Program
given by the local schools on last
Thiusday night proved a splendid en
te tainmcnt, successful from every
vic-w-pcint. Every number on the prc
gr; m was encored by the large uuü-tn.-c
pjfcsent, and every pait tl- .wed
ciin iui training on the part of the in
structors and much hard work for both
teachers and pupils.
While several numbers made speci;
hits, it is only just to say that the little
frogs and the Dutch gills were the
winnors. In the former half a dozen
little folks, dressed in green frog suits,
sang a Frog Song, imitating the frog?,
and at sight of the naughty boy, who
shies the stuties, dived into the water
with a hearty ker-plunk. The Dutch
girlies in their white caps and bib
aprons, showed how the little Dutch
babies go to sleep while the great wind
mills go whirling around. The chorus
"Thanksgiving Draweth Near," as
well as the solo by Mrs. McNeese were
pleasing numbers.
Among the Riley numbers given,
"Miles Standish" and "The Raggedy
Man" appeared to be favorites.
When it is realized that less than a
week was spent in preparation, the
fact is forced home that the children in
Mountainair's schools, as well as the
instructors, are not to be surpassed.
The proceeds amounted tu almost
twenty dollars, which is to be used in
providing decorations for the auditor
ium, and securing apparatus for the
use of the smaller children during play
time. If this, the first entertainment to be
given in the new auditorium, is to be
t iken as a sample of others to follow,
and we believe it is, the people of
Mountainair will vote unanimuu.sly to
biing them on and at no late date.
Thursday Afternoon Club
The Thursday Afternoon Club met
with Mrs. Ilanlon, November 16th. The
attendance was good and a most de
lightful afternoon was spent. Those
on ihe program were unavoidably ab
sent, but our president supplied the de
ficiencies admirably, and the afternoon
ended with the hostess serving delicious
refreshments which all enjoyed.
Mrs. L. J. Putsch is entertaining her
mother, who came down from Barton

PROMOTING BANK
ORGANIZATION
A meeting was held Tuesday evening
at the office of John W. Corbett at
which time Messrs. Gephart and Til-
lery proposed the establishment of a
bank here at Mountainair. These gen
tlemen have spent some time in the val
ley talking with some of the merchants
and farmers, and are of the opinion that
there is a good opening for such an in
stitution here. They explained the state
banking law as to the organization of a
bank, and suggested that our people
get together and take the necessary
preliminary steps toward organization,
that subscriptions for the sale of stock
might be taken up.
Apparently there was quite a deal of
interest manifest, until the suggestion
was .made that it would be necessary to
pay a commission on . the whole of the
capital stock for the selling of the
same. Some were of the opinion that
this was an unnecessary expense, and
should be avoided. Others ' were as
positive that it could not be dispensed
with. Just what further steps will be
taken, if any, were not disclosed before
the meeting broke up.
