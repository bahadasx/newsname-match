'TWAS A SUCCESS.
Saturday Was a Very Busy Day
For Our Advertisers, and the
Buyers Got Many Bargains
Our Gr6t big "Dollar Day" held on
Saturday last, brought to Vale one of
the largest crowds of buyers our en
terprising merchants have handled in
many a day and shows without the
shadow of a doubt that the Expositor
is the proper medium to use if you wish
to reach the buying public in this part
of the state.
The couulry people began to arrive
early ttnd by 10 o'clock the stores that
had specials on were crowded, and were
kept on the jump for the balance of the
day and they are all well pleased with
the day's business, and seem to favor
making "Dollar Day" in Yale an an
nual event. Below we give expres
sions from those who had special sales
on Saturday last:
We enjoyed a splendid trade on Dol
lar Day. The Yale Bazaar.
1 was very well satislled with the fine
trade which Dollar Day brought me.
Am always in favor of auythiug which
will bring avcrowd to Yale, and I ap
preciate the business which was ac
corded me. Fred Tajlor.
Dollar Day exceeded my expectations
as to volume of sales. It sure increas
ed Saturday's business. Cochrane.
Saturday was one of the busiest days
I have had since coming to Yale, and
think the Expositor Dollar Day was
winner. Emerson Cooper.
We did a fine business Saturday and
give Dollar Day credit for a whole lot
of it. Edigholier Bros.
While our Dollar Day specials did
not sell very good, we certainly had a
big trade Saturday .-Mathews Nt Wight.
Business was tine with me on Dollar
Day. J. 1. Rosenthal.
The other merchants who were in on
the deal are all pleased with the busi
ness brought by the Expositor's big
Dollar Day.

of installation of the pastor of the
'resbyterian church, Key. J. 11. Khein-
cans, took place, not a very large

Simpson of Croswell, and Caldwell, oi
anduskv were present, tne nrst named

Lead us to tne rocs: mat is uigner
