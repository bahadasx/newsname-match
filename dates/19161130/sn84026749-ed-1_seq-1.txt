night, after their owners had done a
rush order business In turkeys, geese
and ducks. .
No Bureett Here.
No boycott has been declared in
Washington either on turkeys, butter
or eggs. This could not account for
the lowering pf prices of the fowls,
therefore, and the comedown in Prices

overstocked with turkeys, while the
buyers were few.
No difference was quoted today in
the price of butter end eggs.

CONGRESS TO FIGHT
' HIGH LIVING COST
Evidence Piles Up That Panacea
Will Be Sought at Coming
Short Session.
Evidence continued to pile up here
today that Congress Is going to spend
considerable of Its precious tlme'fn
the coming short session looking for
a high cost of living panacea."
Hero are some of the remedlea
which early arrivals at the Capital
have suggested, and which they say
they will push in resolutions to be in
troduced: An embargo on all foodstuffs.
A law compelling those who store
foodstuffs for speculative purposes to
dispose of 10 per cent of their hold
ings every thirty 'days, at prevailing
prices.

tion of high prices either by the
Federal Trade Commission or a spe
cial Joint Congressional committee
which will recommend legislation
suggested by Its findings.
President far It.
That the President and his Cabi
net will strongly favor the last sug
gestion, Senators and Congressmen
say is a foregone conclusion. The
President has discussed the high liv
ing cost frequently with his Cabinet
advisers, and ho Is taking deop In

The embargo Idea, besides having

backing of many other Congressmen.

Bitter Plght Bur.
However, no food embargo will be
established without a bitter legisla

are expected to line up for It, but
Congressmen from rural districts
have announced they will fight It to
the last.
Republican Minority Leader Mann
and Congressman norland, of Mis
sourl, both with strong followlngs,
believe an embargo Is not what Is
wanted.
If Congressman McLemore thinks a
food embargo will fall of passage, he
will strongly urge the second sugges

at storage speculators.

The latest and most radical pro
posal haa been made by Senator Lewis
of Chicago, who says that when Con
gress meets he will urge a bill under
whloh the Government will have
authority to seise "cornered" food
products and sell them to the public
at a reasonable price. Senator Lewis
has already written to District At
torney Clyne, of Chicago, advocating
this plan.
At the same time, there are many
advocates of a plan for Government
price-fixing.
Speaker Champ Clark expressed the
belief there was a "criminal con
spiracy" to raise the price of certain
articles of food, and that there ought
to be some wa yto reach the con

doubts whether an embargo measure
can pass Congress. He believes the

SAFE CONDUCT EXPECTED
8tate Department Officials Look for
No Interference With Tarnowskl.
Officials today said they believed
the allied governments would take
the hints of their ambassadors here
and permit Count Tarnowskl, new
Austrian ambassadors, to come to
come to Washington without "un
usual Interference.'
It was believed Britain and France
would at least grant the suggestion
made for this Govenrment sent late
yesterday and "reconsider" the case.
These representations, It was stated,
were not a flat request for safe con.
duct for the new envoy, but a re.
minder that failure to acquiesce In
Tarnowskl's right of passage the
right of sovereign nations to ex
change ambassadors being unques.
tlonable would make a distinctly
bad Impression upon pubic opinion
here.
Xo Favors Asked.
The communications are baaed
strictly upon International law. and
In no way make the Issue one of In
ternational courtesy which would
place this country In the attitude of
asking a favor. It Is frankly admitted
that final denial of the request would
create a condition difficult to solve.
Even should safe conduct be grant
ed the Austrian envoy, however. It
would not protect his pspers. These
will be subject to search by the Brit
ish government. Secretary Lansing
has held "sato conduct" jcovera only
"the person," not his effects.
Early Iteply Expected.
A speedy reply Is expected from both
Great Britain and France to the rep
resentations made. Their embassies
hare have already Intimated to their
governments Tarnowskl should b. al
lowed to come. He Is scheduled to
sail from Rotterdam, December 10.
