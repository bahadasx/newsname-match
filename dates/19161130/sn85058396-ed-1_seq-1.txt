SUFFRAGE FOR
BRITISHWOMEN
Parliament Can Hardly Over
look Brave Work of Female
Workers When War Ends.
MLILIONS RALLY TO AID
Serving in All Capacities
While Husbands, Sons and
Brothers Are at Front.
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press).
London, Nov. 30. The saying that
woman's place is in the homo has
little application In war time. There
are now in tho British Isles 3,219,000
women employed outside their own
homes. It is generally recognized
that their rally to work "in the na
tional interest" Is going to make it
difficult for parliament to refuse the.
demand for suffrage which will be re
newed when hostilities end.
During the first two years of war
tho increaso of women workers, ex
clusive of purely feminine occupations
was 866,000. Of these 766,000 directly
replaced male labor. In other words
more than three-quarters of a million
women left their homes to release
that number of men for military serv
ice. In most Instances the women
went into tho munition plants, where
a considerable number of mem have
given up their lives In "doing theifc
bit." There seems to be no limit to tho
class of work women can do. At first
it seemed strange to see girl conduct
ors on tho buses, girl window-cleaners,
van drivers and messengers. But
as the war progressed the field broad
ened and now even in building, min
ing and quarrying scores of women
are employed. The metal trades also
have claimed their share of the now
Industrial army. It must be under
stood that this is an army In skirts.
As a matter of fact skirts are worn
for the most part only In those occu
pations which bring women in touch
with the public. In most of the fac
tories and shops, tho breweries and
the railway yards, jumpers and regu
lation overalls are the approved cos
tume. The bus and tram conductors,
or "conductresses," are jaunty in
their neat blue tunics and skirts reach
just below the knees low enough to
overlap close fitting black leather
puttees. There is seldom a glimpse
of stocking. Tho bus companies is
sued an order recently that no silk
hosiery should be worn.
It is stated that probably 100,000
of the women "war workers" have
been recruited from those formerly
engaged in purely feminine occupa
tions domestics, dressmakers, milli
ners, etc. Tho servant problem is be-'
coming more and moro acute, for tho
demand for munition workers is In
creasing day by day, and the wages
offered are far beyond tho dreams of
avarice to a majority of tho English
domestics.
The number of women employed in
railway work has Increased more than
200 per cent. Ordinarily the only rail
way posts open to women were clerk
ships and carriage-cleaning tasks.
Now there aro women tickot collect
ors, porters, engine cleaners and
workshop laborers. In Glasgow and
somo other cities women are being
tried out as tram drivers or motor
women. Interesting statistics regarding wo
men's part in war work have been col
lected by the employment bureau of
the board of trade. Tho number of
women recruited to Industrial occupa
tions between July, 1914, and July,
1916, was 362,000. Of this number,
263,000 directly replaced men. In com
mercial occupations tho increaso In
tho number of women workers was
198,000, while tho number of wcxnsn
replacing men in this class was 201,
000. This apparent discrepancy is ac
counted for by the transfer of women
from the feminine sldo to tho malo
side of the establishments. Tho in
crease In women clerks amounts to
only 45,000, all of whom, however,
have replaced men. j
The increase of woman workers in
hotels and places of entertainment is
only 19,000, yet tho number of men
replaced in those establishments Is
31,000, many of tho old femal em
ployes now doing tho work of men.
There has been much more discus
sion lately as to whether the city wo
man is a success on the farm and the

According to recent dispatches from Switzerland. Germany is about

nouncement regarding Lithuania. Tho dispatches say the new state will

sovereign and will form a stato of th German emDire yitha sininarttuj
to that of Bavaria or Saxony.
point is far from being settled. Never
theless 66,000 moro women aro work
ing steadily at agriculture today than
In July, 1911. In 191-1 there wore only
2000 women employed in government
arsenals and dockyards. Now there
are over 70,000. The English brew
eries formerly employed 8000 women.
Now they have 18,000. And so it goes
through all tho industries.
As a while tho industrial post-war
problems are going to offer much food
for reflection, and, to be amicably
solved, will require an intelligent skill
of direction and "square dealing'
equal to the best thought and energy

ALL CALLED TO DUTY
Hands That Are Idle Assist the

Not Desire Peace.
Berlin, Nov. 30. (By wireless to Say
ville.) In an address to tho roichstag
yesterday, in Introducing the man
power bill, Chancellor von Bothmann
Hollweg again announced that Ger
many was ready to end the war by a
peace guaranteeing the existence and
future of the nation.
In presenting the bill providing for
compulsory service of civil ions for
war purposes, the chancellor spoke in
regard to the military situation and
tho purposes of the measure. It was
the chancellor's sixtieth birthday and
his desk was decorated with chrys
anthemums. Enemies Not for Peace.
"The war continues, with its de
structive forces," the chancellor said.
"Accordingly our enemies desire it.
They celebrated the past summer as
a period of victory. But did they
obtain what they wanted?
"Our lines aro unbroken and Ru
mania, through which a great change
of events was expected, is now aton
ing for what she did. God has helped
us up to the present. He will help
us further.
Superhuman Heroism of Troops.
"The almost superhuman heroism
of our troops which cannot be express
ed In words of thanks and our clear

only ones, were ready and are ready
to end the war by a peace guarantee
ing our existence and our future they
givo us moral right to such confi
dence. "But, gentlemen, this right ought to
mako us forget duly. Our enemies do
not yet desire peace. They havo su
perior numbers at their command and
almost the whole world delivers war
material to them."
Idle Hands Assist Enemy.
The chancellor urged the necessity
to do everything in Germany's power
In order to manufacture tho necessary
war material, saying:
"Hands that are Idle assist the
enemy."
The bill, ho continued, had been
discussed with tho Interested trades
and In tho reichstag main committee
and was in harmony with the patriot
spirit showed by the whole nation
since tho beginning of the war.
"On behalf of tho -confederate gov
ernments," tho chancellor continued,
"I ask you to assist in the work which
will bring us now strength and guido
us toward victory and peace."
The war minister, Lieutenant Gen
eral von Stein, pointed out tho para
mount importance of war material
during the present conflict He said
tho heroism of tho troops at front
Imposed on every Gorman at homo
tho necessity of providing tho requis
ite materials, and added:
Enemy Suffers Appalling Losses.
"Tho enemy has suffered appalling
losses from our artillery. For a long
time a very cnorgetic French general
stood opposite my sector. Wo found
on prisoners and on tho dead docu
ments which mostly were incompre
hensible to us. From them we learnod
how many death scntencos wore pass
ed by tho general on his own soldiers.
"At tho time of our vlctorous attack
on tho much talked of wire hedge at
Thiopval behind which machino guns
wero placed tho order was given:
'Whoever retreats will bo shot.' At
tho tlmo of tho attack on tho heights
south of Avrlcourt soldlors captured
there stated they had received the or
der: 'Evoryoho who retreats will bo
shot,'
"To us such an order is incompre

duty of our soldiers justify our con
fidence that they will nover bo found

numerically superior forces."
