PROMINENT GLASGOW MAN
DROWNED IN MILK RIVER
Walter Shanley, Clerk of Court Breaks Through Airhole
While Skating Friday Night---Body Found
Walter Shanley, clerk of court of
Valley county, well known in Val
ley and Phillips counties, was drown
ed late Friday afternoon, while skat
ing on the Milk river. His family
(lid not miss him until Saturday
morning, as he intended going to
C~uihertson Friday morning on butsi-"
ness. The first imformation that
he had met with an accident came
Saturday morning when Mrs. Shnn
ley called Mr. Cutting, his deputy
clerk by telephone and asked if he
knew ifi her husband had gone to
Culbertson. Mr Cutting wired the.
conductor on the train.
When it was learned that he was;
not on the train, investigation was I
made and it was learned that he had.
probably gone skating on Friday
.afternoon. The proper authorties
were notified and a party at once
went to the river. They found on
the ice a skater's tracks which led:
to an air hole. This had every ap
pearance, of having been broken in-i
to lately, and it was decided that he+
had been akating there about dusk,
not seeing the hole in. the ice and!
had gone into it. After d~iligent
search his body was recovered about;
60 feet below where he had gone;
under. When the body was brought:
to the surface his clothes gave in
,dio'ation that he had put up a hard
tight to keep alive. His skates were:
still fastened to his shoes.

prominent men in northeastern
lontana. He is at present clerk o1f

There has been a persistent ru-1
V mor in the north country the last
few weeks that the Soo line contem
plated extending its Ambrose
''branch from Whitetail west in the
spring. The rumor is strengthened
h~' the fact that President Edmund
I Penuington of the Soo line, and a
3"party' of officials have been in the
north country inspecting conditions.
The immense crops raised in the!
north country this season has been
1a big inducement to get them to ex

that the Soo officials gave assur
Iances that the new line would be

ural gas baa been flowing from a s

piped to a heating stove and being tb
used every day. If a shallow well

Indications are that there is afi
volume of gas that would prove to o

Secretary W. E. Orrison of the
Malta Commercial club, delivered
first address in a masterly manner.
He discussed the present needs of
the city, and touched on ways of
cooperation between the club and
*the city officials. A few of the more
pressing needs are a public swim
ming pool, a public play ground, a
municipal park, and a gymnasium.
He emphasized the need of real
cleanups, in Malta. and cooperation
between the farmers and people of
Malta.
Prof. John Elliot of the Malta

earnest talk on the necessity of
looking toward and building for
a bigger and better Malta of the

of the needs of the public school,

the future, and the necessity of ag-
riculture courses, and domestic and

The Culbertson jail building,

about 4 a. in., this morning, cremat
ing two inmates who had been ar
rested for store breaking in the ev
ening and lodged in jail about mid
night, The theory advanced by the
authorities is that the men either
planned the fire in the hopes of be

the building on fire through the
careless, use of matches and tobacco.
About 10 o'clock Monday evening,
the two men were discovered at

The men were arrested and plac
