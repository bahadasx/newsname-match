Minneapolis Nov. 24, 1916,
Duar Brit. Garrett-
Greetings! Taking one con
slderation with another, now
that election is pa9t nd
reluctant congrats sent off, it
appears that loosor's lot lacks
hnnnlneas. Cannot ea.v for
certain, though, not having run
or bet. Wilson is a man as will
do his best for couutry, though
of course perfect day must await
principles of Socialism and
Peace, Regarding Free Trade
and Protective Tariff the words
of old Sir Roger Addison Steele
will apply, namely, that much
might be said on both sidrs,
In this city Socialism will be
given tiial on a small scale, Mr.
Van Laar having been elected
Mayor. If he Is the maa he
says ha Is, he should be able to
do some good, some being need
ed no doubt.
Obtrhoffer's band Is on the Job
as usual and can nndoubtedly
play rather harmonious but, for
my humble part I desire more
niceold pieces like by L.Beetbov
en Carrie J. Bond, ete. but now
always is It futurist Amy Lowell
8ch3ol that don't rhyme or sing
which for be It from me to
criticiza yet might I remark
give ma Brahms or give me
Berlin!
The Third Avenue Bridge la
not quite finished yet and will
have to hurry to get done before
scow flies. When ready I will
send vou a picture. Them
concrete sublime arches,
striding majestic over historic
St, Anthony Falls which by
running mills did for this town
what Scblitz is alleged to have
done for Milwaukee, those, I
repeat, will be a memorable
experience.
Speaking of Milwaukee re
rnlnda me of a phase of the
election the rising wave of
Prohibition, which as you truly
remark, is grandly crawling
over TJ, S, It is a beautiful thing
and now let all good men help to i
bring on the day when only
crystal water sball gurgle,
where now rolls the demon rum.
Thanks for the helpful article
on shape of earth like a lemon
w itb theory of reasons filling a
long felt want ' The CRESSET
club movement originating in
Chicago ia an epoch making
start, There should be a cluh in
every community where the
dear CRESSET circulates with
joy and solomn mirth.
Not for long have we heard
from bro. C. B. S. o St. Paul
whose verses sometimes adorn
ed your columns, In geueral
principles I would not as a rule
recommend anything that came
from there, but as a man that
wants to be square I will admit
that even in that desolate place
i,herfl mav exist one or two more
or less upright personalities of
which the Bro. is one. Please
write hoping this will find you
well- In peace.
