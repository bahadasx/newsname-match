STANFORD UNIVERSITY, ' Cal.,
Nov. 29. Mrs. David Starr Jordan,
wife of Stanford's chancellor emeri
tus, with the wives of Stanford pro
fessors and other Talo Alto women,
has launched a movement to stand
ardize women's dress and desert fick

a club for the purpose.
The club is going to try to limit
the wardrobe to two or three styles
not dresses varied for different
occasions in colors and materials.
VISALIA, Cal., Nov. 29. The
old Visalia House, rendezvous of
many of the world's famous charac
ters, erected almost simultaneously
with the birth of Visalia, the oldest
city in the San Joaquin Valley, a
landmark throughout California, is
about to go. The age of progress has
demanded this site for a new 5-story
modern hotel building and workmen
have begun the work of razing the
building to make way for the new
structure.
The old structure, one of the first
brick buildings in the valley, was
erected 57 years ago.
A glance over the registers of the
years gone by discloses the names of
Bret Harte, Bill Nye, Gen. U. S.
Grant, Mark Twain and hundreds of
others who figured in the early his
tory of the West and of national and
even international reputation. Gen.
Grant spent several nights here en
route to visit the great General Grant
big trees in the national park also
named for him, and many of the
stories told by Clemens had their
impetus in and around Visalia, where
the famous wit spent many days with
his friends, Bret Harte and Bill Nye.
AH three mentioned the Visalia
House in their stories.

that day to remind them that it would
be better for them to behave them
selves and be out of jail on that day
and eat their turkey at home.

NEW YORK, Nov. 29. Ten mat
rimonial commandments for husbands
as put forth by the Rev. Frank Ride-
out, pastor of the Second Baptist
Church at Bridgeport, Conn., are de
signed, he says, to insure perfect wed
lock. They cover ever contingency
that might wreck a happy home, the
pastor thinks, make an insurance pol
icy covering perfect matrimony.
The decalogue for the perfect wife
is: '
1. Thou shalt not be a spendthrift
Do not squander thy husband's hard
earned money. It is sacred to him
and should be to you.
2. Thou shalt not talk shop when
thy husband returns at night Re
member he has had shop all day.
Study politics or base ball so as to
interest him in something new.
3. Thou shalt not fail to have his
meals on time. When the animal is
fed you will have a gentleman to
spend the evening with you.
4. Thou shalt not quiz thy wedded
husband. Do the quizzing before the
marriage. Be adriot and he will tell
you all. i .
6. Thou shalt not nag thy wedded
husband. Hit him with an ax. It is
more kind.
6. Thou shalt not fail to dress up
for thy husband as thou didst before
thy marriage.
7. Thou shalt not try to fight thy
husband. The male has always been
the best fighter of the two. Don't
fight. Crying will fetch him sooner.
8. Thou shalt not expect thy hus
band to apoligize even when he is
wrong. Let it pass. Kiss him and
give him a hot steak for supper. Then
forget it.
9. Thou shalt not hesitate to assure
thy husband that he is the greatest
living man, and that thou dost admire
him far more than Hughes or Roose
velt
10. Thou shalt never remind thy
husband of the awful sacrifice thou
didst make to marry him. If thou
didst love him then there WW no sac
rifice.
What the husband must do is set
out as follows:
1. Thou shalt not praise thy
neighbor's wife. Praise thine own.
2. Thou shalt not be stingy with
thy wife. Thou mightest as well be
generous. She earns half the salary,
anyway. Thou dost work eight hours
a day, but she never knoweth when
her work is ended.
4. Thou shalt not share thy love
for thy wife with the booze shop. She
deserveth it all.
5. Thou shalt not keep any secrets
from thy wife. Secrets breed sus
picion and wreck confidences.
6. Thou shalt not refuse to talk
with thy wife after the day's work
is over. Don't shut up like a clam,
and, besides, if she wants to talk she
can't help it.
7. Thou shalt not fail to provide
life insurance for thy wife and chil
dren.
8. Thou shalt not scold thy wife
when the meat burns up, as it will
even in the best regulated home.
Don't rage, but go out and blow up a
P'wder mill.
9. Thou shalt not fail to kiss thy
wife good-by in the morning.
10. Thou shalt not forget through
all the passing years that thy wife
whom God had given thee as thy com
panion is thy superior.

The intimation was that this had been
purposely allowed by certain specula
tors to keep down the supply.
Jordan stated that he had been told
that each season the dealers in Kan
sas City set a day on which no more
old potatoes could be brought by the
consumer, that after that day only
new potatoes could be found on the
market.
