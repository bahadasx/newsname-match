HAYTI,
SILVER ANNIVERSARY
Mr. and Mrs. Peter Streiff of
this city rounded otit twenty
five years of happy married life
last Sunday by celebrating the
anniversary with a silver wed
ding, to which their immediate
family and quite a number of inti
mate friends were invited and
attended.
In order that the hospitality
of the occasion may be compre
hended, a little of the history of
these twoestimable people should
be known.
iiotb were born and spent
their youth on the other side of
the Atlantic. Not in the same
land, nor are they of the same
nationality. Peter Streiff was
born July 12, 1865, at Maxstadt,
Alsace Lorraine, France, where
the purple grapes, kissed by the
warm south sun, are converted
into red wine, and where art and
science and music reach full
flower; where every man is a
gentleman, and where repast
and feast knows no bounds.
Mrs. Streiff, who was Magdalire
Trapp, was born September 6,
1869, at Medelsheim, Bavaria,
Germany, the land of thrift, in
a us try and education.
Peter Streiff sailed for America
29 years ago, while Miss Trapp,
the young lady destined to be
come his bride, followed one year
later. Next, these two young
people met in Memphis, Tennes
see, and were married there Nov
ember 24, 1891. So Prance and
Germany werevfedin 'America,
and here have lived and pros
pered and raised their family.
Of people oi such ancestral ori
gin, and of love that followed its
course across the sea, much of
the perfections of life might be
expected, but no one not present
at the celebration of their silver
wedding could know the height
of enjoyment and good things
these people could provide for
such an occasion.
The tables, which were laden
with life's luxuries, such as only-
those having the experience
garnered from the culinary arts
of two continents know how to
MISSOURI, THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 80, 1916.
provide, together with the whole
hearted hospitality the guests
were made to feel, gave to the
occasion a charm that only those
present can know. Columns
might be filled with words at
tempting to describe the various
tasty and uniquo features pro
vided, but language is not suffi
cient to tell of the cheer and
good-will of these two happily
married people, as they received
their guests and bade them wel
come, so mention of the bare de
tails must suffice, leaving the
reader to picture the event in his
or her own way.
By reference to the date of
married life of Mr. and Mrs.
Streiff, it will be observed the
calendar anniversary fell two
days prior to the celebration of
Sunday, to wit, November 24,
but in order that friends would
have better opportunity of at
tending, the occasion was post
poned until Sunday, as stated.
Anotner event of no minor im
. .
portance, at least, to another
member of the Streiff family,
namely, 'Miss Katherine, also fell
on the 24th, that being the 19th
birthday of the young lady. This
event was therefore automat
ically celebrated in the chimes of
the silver wedding bells that
echoed again the troth of her
French German parentage.
Mr. and Mrs. Streiff are the
parents of ten children, eight of
whom are living, their names be
ing, John, Katherine, Peter Jr.,
Lena, August, Elizabeth, Herman
and Evelyn. John, the e'ldest, is
married and lives aiPa'scola, but
was present with the rest of his
brothers and sisters Sunday.
The reception was held from 3
to 8 p. m. At 5 p. m. dinner was
served, covers being1 laid for
twenty five, thus carrying out
the theme of the anniversary.
Two tables were tilled. Misses
Katherine Streiff, and Mar
guerite Friderich of Caruthers
ville presided at the punch bowl.
Two large cakes, one lor the
silver wedding, the other for
Miss Strieff's birthday, adorned
the tables, and were much en
joyed by the participants of the
feast. After dinner Mr. Strietf
served French Bruloo, also the
gentlemen ' with cigars; and,
having all these years kept some
whiskey made by his mother in
France, those who cared to were
giveri the liberty of tasting the
rare product. It was 47 years
old, having been made in ISO!).
Another incident to increase I
tho enjoyment of the occasion
was the rendition oi several
choice pier-Ps of music by the
Hayti Hushar Baud. For this
added pleasure credit is due, nut
only the biid but also to Marine
Stockmanu, who ".show d the Itehii uo npuuus in this part of

SCHOOL NOTES.
BW. M. JOHMSOM. Sufmtnt
The Freshman class held a
social at the school building Fri
. da-v zoning, tho teachers assist-
f.ir'i"K with the program.
These
social gatherings for the High
School students, coming on Fri
day evenings after tho week's
work is completed, and then not
too much of a protracted nature,
willcertainlv furnish wholesome
social recreation for our young
people. Young folks need some
time for social life, but it should
come at the close of the week, so
as not to interfere with the
preparation of lessons for the
next day. Students cannot do
the work wnen social affairs are
'.alwed to come between them
md their school work. There
should be a close understanding
between parents, teachers and
students in regard to these mat
ters. The public school should
be not only a place for work and
close application to studies, but
also a place for recreation at the
proper time.
The public school teachers of
Pemiscot county meet with us
next Thursday, Friday and Sat
urday.. We certainly feel honored
by having them meet with us.
Some of the school boys, Mr.
Brooks and the writer will go
out on the annual Thanksgiving
camping trio, which has become
so popular with those composing
the party. A complete equip
ment for three days' outing will
be carried, especially meat,
bread and other delicacies of the
table.
An account of Patrons' Meet
ing will be given in next week's
issue of the Herald. Were you
m-e.sent? Wliv not?
The floors in those rooms
winch weie not oiled at, the be
ginning of the term, will be given
a good coat ot oil Friday and
Saturday. This will help solve
the dust problem in these rooms.

Oates-Allen.
The Herald this week takes
pleasure in surprising the many
friends in this city and commu
nity of the marriage of J. V.
Oates of this city and Miss Violet
K. Allen of Cape Girardean.
The event is the culimination
of a romance that started several
years ago when Mr. Oates en
tered the Normal at Cape Girar
deau, forming the acquaintance
of this estimable young lady.
The ceremony was preformed
at Cape Girardeau Sunday, Nov
ember 26th, by Rev. Scruggs,
pastor of the First Baptist
Church of that city.
The bride is the only daughter
of Mrs. Elizabeth Allen, a trained
nurse of the Cape, and Miss
Allen at the time of her marriage
was holding a very nice position
as bookkeeper for Buokner Rags
dale Company, one of the largest
department store of that city.
She was a favorite among the
younger set of her home town,
and her friends will be sorry to
lose her society.
Mr Oates is a native Hay Man,
being the son of Mrs. S L. Oates,
an old pioneer citizen. He is held
in the highest esteem by those
who know him, and those are the i
business men and general public
of Hayti. He is honest, and the
Herald can commend him to his
choice. At the present he is also
a bookkeeper for the Arkansas
Grocer Co , at Blythevllle, Ark.
We are informed the young
people will be at home to their
friends and acquaintances at
Blvtneville in about two months.
The Herald is pleased to join in
extending congratulations anJ ,
a hippv life.
