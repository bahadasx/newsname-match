Am glad to report that health is fine
in this vicinity.
J. R. Meece made a business trip to
Asheville in his Ford last week.
Farmers are most thru gathering and
sowing grain. We have had exceed
ingly fine weather for farm work this
fall.
Rev. J. M. Stansell, one of the Six
Mile ministerial students, will preach at
Antioch Baptist church the first Sunday
in December at 11 o'clock a. m.
Miss May Gilstrap will return Mon
day, November 27, to take up her du
tied as assistant tsacher in the Wolf
Creek school. We congratulate this
school in getting Miss May as one of
their teachers.
Mr. Hannon Durham and family of
Williamston visited Mrs. Durham's
brother, Mlr. Elijah Winchcster, and
family recntly. They returned by Nine
Times, where they visited Mr. James
Winchester, another brother of Mrs.
Durham.
Prof. .1. L. Murphy paseed thru this
section a few days ago on his way to
visit relatives and friends in Rosman,
N. C., and on his return reported a
good time. Mrs. Wash Galloway came
back with him to spend the winter with
her daughter, Mrs. J. L. Murphy.
J. W. Gilstrap is the champion turnip
raiser on this creek this season, having
raised one that weighed 4 pounds and
ope ounce. Who can beat it? He is a
widower the second time and is now liv
ing by himself, so we feel sure that he
needs a woman to cook those fine tur
ntps for him.
We had the pleasure of entertaining
one night last week our good old friend
and neighbor Robert L. Gilstrap of
Oconee. He was over in the interestof
a well water drawing device which he
invented and has recently got a U. S.
patent on. Mr. Gilstrap was born and
reared on this creek, but for the past
18 or 20 years has been making his home
near Walhalla.
The Antioch school began its winter
term November 13, with Miss May
Garrett as teacher. Enrollment was
fine the first day and the school is doing
good work.' Let me say right here that
we have onesscholar, Ben Tillman Win
chester, who stood the last teachers'
examination at Pickens and won a sec
ond grade certificate and he has never
been to school anywhere except at
Antioch. The last teachers' examina
tion is also said to be the hardeft the
state has ever sent out. I am not tell
ing this in a boasting way, but just to
show what can be done in our little
home country schools. So let us try
harder and work more for the upbuild
ing of our country schools. Antioch has
already turned out foui teachers and
others are struggling hard for the work.
The present board of trustees is doing
all in its power to improveeach term of
school, and we say to everybody, do all
you can for the cause aud advancement
of education. MOUNTAIN SPROUT.
Death ot Mrs. Rebecca Grant
Mrs. Rebecca Grant died at her home
near Crow Creek on November 3, 1916.
She was 83 years of age. Her husband,
J Wesley Grant, preceded her to the
grave 52 years. He served in the war
between the states. She was the (laugh
ter of the late James and Lydia Neal
and first.cousin to beloved R.A.Thomp
son, deceased, of Walhallt. She was
born near old Pendleton December 25,
1833, and was raised in Oconee county.
She was a consecrated christian woman,
a member of the Methodist church for
70 years and a great Bible reader. She
would read it every day as long as she
was able. Like Mary of old, she was
always ready to serve. She was loved
by all who knewv her.
Beneath a mound of lovely flowers
In the quiet churchyard ground.
We laid her down to slumber
Till the trump of God shall sound.

Good Times on Central Route 3
The people of this community are
generally in a fine mood over twenty- v
cent cotton. New buildings going up, )
old ones being repaired, people flocking n
to the center of life and uplift, the Six
Mile Academy, others going out to
spread its fragrance in other commun
ities as teachers, and so it goes. a
One of the most enjoyable occasions t
of the week was the <celebration of the
63rd birthday of Mr. Anthony Baker at
his home the 20th inst., when the chil- h
dren and some of the near relatives and
friends collected there. The party con- t
sisted of R. M1. Baker and famiiy, B.R '
Parrott and family, Bruce Hunnicutt
and family, Tilman Garrett and family, d
Mr. and Mrs. John T. Cantrell, Mr. and g
Mrs. M, D. Cantrell, Mr. Richard Baker a
and family, Rev. and Mrs. J. L. Willis, t
Rev. and Mrs. B. C. Atkinson and son,
Rev. Charles, Rev. E. M. Bolding and
family, Mr. and Mrs. A. D. Mann, R. b
P. Prince and family, Mr. and Mrs. R. 9
K. Lewis and a few others. 'The long 7
table was loaded to its capacity and the t
quality being the best part. After din- t
ner the crowd enjoyed one hour in song,
prayer and several good talks from t
members of the crowd This ending a I a
happy day at a good home. The crowd <
having best wishes for Mr. and Mvs. 1
Baker for the future. P. t
Nelson-Kay
The officiating officer, J. Alonzo Brown
was taken on a complete surprise on
last Sunday, November 26. about 3.30
p. m., when Mr. Perry T. Kay of Cen
tral route 2 and Miss Bell Nelson of
Central route 1 presented themselves
for the hol bonds of matrimony. After
showing their authority why such re
qnest should be granted, and His Honor
calling for objections and hearing none,
they were soon made one flesh and blood.
Mr. Kay is the youngest son of Mr.
and Mrs. D. L. Kay of near Sit Mile
and is a promising young farmer who
numbers his friends by the score, while
his bride is one of the eldest daughters
of Rev. and Mrs. T. F. Nelson or near .
Central. She is one of a set of triplets,
two of whom are living, and to now I
her is o love her. They are receiving
the congratulations of many friends. i
B. t
Successful Hot Supper
Charlie Smith and another negro
whose name we are unable to find out,
who both work on the new double track
ner Central, went to a hot supper at
Central Friday night and had a quarrel.
Both negroes slept in the same tent,
and after the quarrel the "other" ne
gro went to his tent. Smith followed
and as soon as his roommate got in bed
Smith pulled his gun and shot thru the
side of the tent and left. Investigation
showed that the ball entered the other
negro's breast and inflicted what isI
thought to be a fatal wound. Officers
are after Smith now and it is likely that
he will be caught, as he was recently
on the county chaingang for gambling -
and, is well known. The officers also
searched several shanties in the rail
road camp and found twenty-eight ~
pints of whiskey.
