No one would think of riding in a
freight car if he could enjoy the
comfort of a big, comfortable easy
riding Pullman parlor car.
So with automobiles. Most of the
popular priced cars ride like
freight cars. This is due to the
old fashioned type of spring.

SURPRISE PARTY
A number of the "old-timers"
who have been residents of this
community for over thirty years
got together last Thursday even
ing and held a little surprise
party on Mr. Dan Lee and his
niece, Miss May Lee. They met
at the H. P. Patten home and
went in a body from there to
Mr. Lee's, taking them entirely
by surprise.
After a time spent in talkinir
over old times, the visitors brot
forth the good things to eat that
they had brought along, includ
ing a delicious roast turkey and
for a time conversation lagged as
everyone was too busy to talk.
When the proper time arrived
two mysterious packages were
produced, one contained a gold
watch for Mr. Lee and the other
a piece of cut glass for Miss
Lee. These were presented to
them as slight tokens of esteem
from the following friends:
Messrs. and Mesdames H.
Patten, Hugo Gunkel, Ed. Mit
chell, A. R. Raker, L. N. Wood,
Chas. Chalmers, and 1. W.
Standley and Messrs. W.
Picken and J. H. McCollom.
Mr. Lee was one of the early
settlers in the county, having
arrived here about thirty-two
years ago. He recently sold his
property and we understand
will leave for the east in a few
weeks to make his future home.
|His niece will accompany him.
The many friends of Mr. and
Miss Lee deeply regret their
departure but extend to them
their verv best wishes for health
prosperity and happiness in
their new home.
