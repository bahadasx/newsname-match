road of about (!90 miles, bettering by
about 100 miles the record made by
Victor Carlstrmn on November '2.
A delayed start and a cross wind
that cut down her speed and forced
her to descend to replenish the gaso
line supply wcro responsible for her
failure to reach Now York City.

never made a single Might longer than
