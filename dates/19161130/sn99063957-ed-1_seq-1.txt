Allies Pin Their Faith On Czar's
Yon Mackensen Thrust at
and If Successful Will Permit Rumanians to Gain Ground
i in Transylvania Outside of Balkans But Little Fighting
London. Nov. HO. The allies are pinning their faith
on the Russians to extricate Rumania from the German
war pincers.
Dispatches today indicated that the czar's forces were
pounding vigorously at German positions in the southern
Carpathians, inaugurating an offensive which experts
here were confident would force Fjeld Marshal Von
Mackensen to cease some of his pressure on the Rumanian
forces now approaching the line from which they will
defend the capital. 1 -
The Russian thrust at Kirlibaba was regarded here as
the best possible strategic move since, if successfully
maintained, it would force a straightening out of the
German lines, permitting the Rumanians to gain back a
goodly portion of Transylvania. If the German line was
not straightened out under these conditions, it would be
in danger of a strong flanking movement.

Nearly $900,000 More On
Hand'Than A Year Ago
of Salem Money
Judging from tlio bank statements
issued a few days ago, some folks in
Salem or vicinitv must have abundant
renson for giving thanks today. The
four banks in Salem have on deposit
exactly $8S0,2.14.(32 more than they had
one year ago.
And there is a suspicion that the
farmer U the men who is piling up
this extra amount of not far from a
million dollars compared to that they
had one year ago.
With everything the fanner had this
year yielding big crops and high prices
for all his products, the farmer just
could not dodge prosperity.
In the four Salem bunks, the to'.al
deposits are $5,354,735.21. One year ago
they were $4,474,480.59. With almost
five and a half millions deposits in
the city' banks, it is pretty evident
that some folks are not suffering to
any great extent from hard times. And
every man may work this winter and
there is plenty to do. Two years ago,
the Salem Social Service Center and
Commercial club were doing their best
to find work for the many unemployed
and George F. Rodgers bad establish
ed the home on Ferry street for the
great army of unemployed.

COLGATE BEATS BROWN IN
MOST IMPORTANT GAME
U. of C. and U. of W.
Game of Coast With U. of
W. Favorite
Andrews Field, Providence, ft. I.,
Nov. 30. Colgate overwhelmed tho
much heralded Brown eleven here 28
to 0. The Brunonains were powerless
against the shifty, driving Maroon at
tack, which swept down tho field, de
spite ankle deen mud and a steady
downpour of rain. At every department
of the fame the brilliant Hamilton elev
en outclassed Brown. The Maroon at
tack slid off tackle for successive first
downs, the Brown linesman being easi
ly boxed.
Pollard, the dusky Brown star, fail
ed to shine and was smothered every
time ho took tho ball.
Tho, first Colgate touchdown came
within five minutes after the whistle
blew starting the game and from then
on Colgute persistently threatened the
llrowu goul.

Oames Hit the Skids.
By H. C. Hamilton.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
New York, Nov. 30, Jerked from his
pedestal three days ' before he usually
buys tickets for the skids, King Football
will pass out for 1910 early this after
noon. Officiating at the demise will
be several prominent huskies, among
them Brown and Colgate universities,
two eastern unstarts; Pittsburg and
Pennsylvania State and Rutgers and
Washington and Jefferson.
Ordinarily, football survives until the
Saturday following Thanksgiving day,
but this year the Army and Navy, de
parting from time honored custom, de
cided to get to the people before the
suffering public was weighted down
with Thanksgiving dinners and such,
and closed up shop last Saturday.
Ho the east will have with us today
tho aforementioned Brown versus Col
gate affuir at Providence. The most
prominent entertainment of the duy.
A warm rain was falling throughout
the east and sloppy fields were prom
ised. Colgate has visions of championship
claims as she enters the contest. Since
Brown took the measure of both Yule
and Harvard and since Yale beat Col
gate, there is little chnnce'for the New
Yorkers to receive much of a rating un
less they do hammer a victory out of
Pollard et al. Colgate figures that if it
is uble to put a knot in the Brownonion
standard it will be able to Iny claim to
the championship.
At that, Pittsburg has something to
say, and unless Peon State manages to
take a full out of Glenn Warner's gang
at Pittsburg today the Colgute cluiin
would be rather empty.
Colgate backers are going the limit
behind the New York State team. They
declare there isn't a stronger eleven
in the east and that with even n sem
blance of luck Yale would have been
on the short eud iu the recent meeting.
While these arguments are going on
over championship possibiltes, Cornell
and Pennsylvania will be at grips in
Philadelphia, sitting in at the death of
the uutumu sport.
Dobie Cheers Up.
Seattle, Wash., Nov. 30. A rare bit
of Thanksgiving carving will be put
over here today when the football teams
of the Universities of California and
Washington meet on University field in
the football classic of the coust.
Both coaches are predicting victory
It is the first time iu nine years, the
length of his stay here that Gilmmir
Dobie, Washington coach, has made n
prediction before a game bus been play
ed, that his tcuni would win. In the nine
years he has not lost a game.
Washington is being, made n two to
one favorite today by Seattle bettors
with plenty of California money in
sight.
On dope the two tennis seem about n
toss up as far as strength is concerned.
The dny broke cleur nnd crisp follow
ing a light rain last night and the grid-j
iron was in excellent trim for the en- j
counter.
The Bear Staters were hoping for
their siieed to carry them to victory
while Dobie has been schooling his men j
in the forward pass and it is expected
he will use this in an effort to bring
home the bacon.
' Both teams tre in splendid condition.

London, Nov. 30. Crypt No. 133 in
the vault of the age-darkened chapel
of the Copuciu Fathers in Vienna will
tonight hold the mortal remains of tho
late Emperor of Austria-Hungary.
Dispatches from Vienna today said
preparations for the funeral will be
completed with all the regal show and
pomp of medieval custom that the rigid
etiquette of the most formal court in
tho world stipulates. "
Franz Josef will tako his place among
the Hnpsburg dead lute today. The fu
neral procession, w hich will bear 'his
body to the grave where he joins his
ancestors, will start at 4:30 from tho
llofburg palace. The emperor's last rest
ing place is a short block distant from
the ancient llofburg stato palaco,
through crowded narrow streets, in
some places less than 10 feet wide.
Custom decreed that the late emperor
should lay iu state iu the coldly-formal
llofburg palace which abode Franz
Josef iu life detested and that after
a ec .ain number of hours the body
should be transported, in specified fash
ion, to the dingy little church of the
Cupucin Fathers, the monks who for
centuries have been keepers of the
llapsburg doud. f
At 4:d0 today precisely the' deep
throated tones of the giant bell in the
400 foot steeple of tit. Mtcphnns church,
mingling with scores of others, will an
nounce termination of the formal cere
monial in the llofburg Augustiner
church of "Blessing the imperial dead"
and beginning of the march to the
grave.
Royalty All There.
In that procession will be representa

lies and one of the greatest gatherings
of royalty since the death of (jueen Vic
toria of England. The one notable ab
sentee Will be Kniser Wilholm of Ger
many, who left Vienna yesterday on
strict orders of his physician. - The Ger
man emperor had a bad cold, but not
withstanding, had come to the Austrian
capital for the funeral. His physician,
however, ordered that he leave the damp
climate at once. There were to be half
a dozen other members of German roy
alty in Vienna, however, and Czar Ford
inand of Bulgaria, the Crown Prince
Boris and Prince Cyrill of that same
country; the Turkish Crown Prince Wa
hid Eddin; Prince Alfonso Be Bourbon
of Austria; Infanta Dona Maria Delos
Nieves, and the Crown Prince Gustnv
Adolf of Hwcdea. These joined in the
funeral procession with u resplendent
guard of honor.
Custom decrees that the most resplen
dent of all ceremonies of the burial of
an emperor tuke place in the plain 400
year old chapel of the Capucins. The
walls of this little church and the altar
will be draped in solid black. In this
Egyptian gloom scores of wax caudles
will throw u dim, ghostly light over the
gloomy interior. All the rough benches
will have been taken out und all the
notables will be required to stand. The
Hapsburg custom decrees that the mas
ter of ceremonies, resplendent in black,
red and gold, shall come from the jtner
isty as soon as the procession moves and
shall act as usher to those seeking ad
mittance to the tiny chapel, arranging
them in accordance with birth, runk and
stution in life.

Emperor Franz Josef's intimuta for

to whom he was credited with pouring
out his sorrows was refused a last view
of the man she loved, was told today in

morning after the aged emperor died,
she ilem luded admittance to the palace

his court a decision whether she should

SAFE CONDUGTWILL
BE GIVEN MINISTER
General Belief Is Austrian
Ambassador Will Be On
His Way Soon
By Robert J. Bender,
(United I'ress .Stnff Corersponde.ht.)
Washington, Nov. 30.- Officials to
day believed tho allied governments
will tako the hints of their ambassadors
hero and permit .Count Tarnowski, the
new Austrian ambassador, to come to
Washington without "unusunl inter
ference." It was believed Great Britain and
France, at least, would grant the sug
gestion made 'by this government in
representations sent late yesterday, to
"consider" tho case. These represen
tations, it was stated,, wero not a flat
request for safe conduct for the new
envoy, but a reminder that failure to
justify Tarnowski 'a right of passage
the right of sovereign nations to ex
change ambassadors being inalienable
would mnke a distinctly bad impres
sion upon public opinion here.
The communications are based strict
ly upon international law and in no
way make tho issue one of interna
tional courtesy, which would place thisi
country in the attitude of asking a
favor. It is frankly admitted that
final denial . of the request would
create a. condition difficult to solve.
Even should safe conduct bo granted,
the Austrian envoy,, however, it would
not protect hiB papers. Theso will be
subjoct to search by the British gov
ernment. It wns rcfalled today that
when both Ambassador Dumba and
Captain Von Fapen, German military
attache here, were recalled they were
granted afe conduct .but tho ship on
which tjcy sailed wns stopped by the
British government and private papers
wero taken from both. Secretary Lans
ing has held "safe conduct" coverB
only 'the person" not his effects.
A speedy reply is expected from
both England and Franco to tho repre
sentations. Their embassies here have
already intimated to their governments
Tarnowski should be' allowed to come.
Ho is scheduled to sail December 10
from Rotterdam.

30 Days
Washington, Nov. 30. Evidence Con
tinued to pile up hero today that con
gress is going to Bpeud considerable
of its precious time In the coming short
session looking for a high coat of living
panacea.
Here are some of the remedies which.
early arrivals at the capital have sug
gested, and which they say will push iu
resolutions to be introduced:
An embargo on all foodstuffs.
A law compelling those who stora
foodstuffs for speculative purposes to
dispose of 10 per cent of their holdings
every 30 days, at prevailing prices.
Investigation of tne entire question
of high prices either by the federal
trude commission or a special joint con
gressional committee which will recom
mend legislation suggested by its find
ings. That the president and his cabinet
will strongly favor tho last suggestion.
senators and representatives say, is a
foregone conclusion. Tho president o
discussed the high coat of living fre
quently with his cabinet advisers and ha
is taKing deep interest in the work of
the postoffice, commerce and agricultur
al departments along this line.
The embargo" idea,1' besides bavin;
Representative Fitzgerald of New York,
to lead it, will have tho strong backing
of many other congressmen. Iteprosen
tative Jeff McLemore said today he
will favor it, and that he has inter
viewed or heard by mail from many oth
ers who will do the same. '
However, no food embargo will be es
tablished without a bitter legislative
fight.' Many urban, representatives are
expected to line np for it, but r.eprtsen
tntives from rural districts have an
nounced they will fight it to the last.
Republican Minority Leader Mann d
Representative Borlund, Missouri, both
with strong followings, believe an em
bargo is not what is wanted.
If Representative McLemore thinks a.
fond embargo will fail of passage, he
will strongly urge the second suggestion
mentioned above, which would hit bard
at storage speculators.
Borland wants a congressional or fed
eral trade commission investigation.
