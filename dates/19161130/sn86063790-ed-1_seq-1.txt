WILL PAY' DEATH PENALTY
OVERTON CONVICTED OF MURDERING
JUDGE LAWLER.
Sentenced to Re Electrocuted January
12.?Plea Was Self
Defense.
Huntsville, Nov. 28.?"Guilty of
murder in the first degree," with a
recommendation that the death pen
alty, hanging, be imposed, was the
verdict of a jury today in the case
of David D. Overton, accused of the
murder near here last June Of Probate
Judge J. T. Lawler, his political
opponent.
The verdict was returned at 11:30
o'clock this morning, after the jury
had deliberated since 6:30 p. m. yesterday.
The execution was set for
January 12 by Judge B. M. Miller,
but suspension was ordered when
counsel for the defense filed a motion
for a new trial. Date for a hearing
on the motion has not been fixed.
When the verdict was read Overton
remained calm; but a perceptible
expression of surprise came over his
face. He was asked by Judge Miller
if he had anything to say. He was
oilonf norhono ton eocnnHc
Ul IV/lXb y\yi VVU UVVVAAVftt^t
"I Am Not Guilty."
"Nothing, Judge," he replied, "except
that I am not guilty."
The words came from his lips in almost
a whisper. Judge Miller then
pronounced the sentence, counsel for
the defense filed their motions for a
new trial and Overton was taken to
the Madison county jail, where he
will remain until his case finally is
disposed of.
Mystery surrounding the discovery
on June 17 of the body of1 Judge
Lawler in a Tennessee river slough
under the Whitesburg bridge, ten
miles from here, was not cleared up
until November 24, when Overton at
his trial admitted he shot and killed
the jurist on the bridge the night of
June 14.
He declared, however, that he killed
Judge Lawler after the latter had
attacked him with a knife. The attack,
he said, followed his (Overton's)
refusal to join Lawler in a
plan to try to delay a report which
was expected from a special grand
jury of the Madison county circuit
court.
Denied Moving Body.
The grand jury was understood to
be investigating alleged irregularities
in the election last spring, in
which Lawler defeated Overton for
the probate judgeship. Overton denied
he had anything to do with the
disposition of Lawler's body. He asserted
he and the jurist had driven
in his buggy from the county court
house in Huntsville to the Whitesburg
bridge to discuss political differences
which they hoped to settle.
These alleged differences were not
explained.
At the trial the disposition of the
body was not entirely cleared up,
?n A + +
mouga Lllti 1l1 llHiaLiuii was ii.1au.c7 ihol
"only Sheriff Phillips could explain."
The sheriff was a political friend of
OvAton and he committed suicide a
few days after the discdvery of Lawler's
body, saying he could not stand
the suspicion directed at him.
Shelby Pleasants, a prominent attorney,
also committed suicide soon
after the "killing, though there had
been nothing developed to establish
any connection between him and the
crime.
Gives Bond of $25'000.
Chattanooga, Nov. 28.?As the result
of a preliminary hearing Frederick
Cornellson, under arrest on the
charge of larceny of $40,000 from
the Southern Express company's wagon
last Monday night, has been admitted
to a bond of $25,000 by the
criminal court today. No new evidence
was brought out and the defense
did not introduce any witnesses.
Cornellson had no trouble
in making bond.

New York, Nov. 28.?Announcement
was made here tonight of the
organization under the laws of this
State of the New York Shipbuilding

| BOILER JARS ORANGEBURG.
Near-Miracle Wrought When Nobody
is Badly Injured in Terrific Blast.
Orangeburg, Nov. 28.?What is
unanimously considered little short
of a miracle occurred here today,
shortly after noon when the boiler at
the Orangeburg steam laundry exploded
and the two ends traveled
, through the air in opposite directions
about a half block. The re
markable part lay in the fact that no
one was seriously and, it is said, only
one child slightly, injured. The plant
had closed down for dinner and the
steam was rather low.
Goes Through Clear Space.
From what could be learned, when
the boiled exploded the head arose to
a considerable height and started in
the direction of Russell street. Fortunately
it headed for an opening
about fifteen feet wide, between the
brick garage of Crum Brothers and
the small wooden store of W. T.
Brickie. With'the exception of making
three stops, striking a fence, the v
ground and a corner of the frame / ' J; j
building, it proceeded straight
through this opening into Russell
street. Here it landed, though reluctantly,
for it is told by eyewit-^
nesses that the wandering boiler head
seemed inclined to rise again, but
too much steam had been spent. ' HH
Little Damage Done. , '
The other end landed near the corner
of Calhoun and Windsor streets,
and evidently succeeded in getting
there through open space, for no serious
damage was done. A small
frame dwelling house, in which some
of the employes of the laundry live,
was damaged to some extent by hot
water and mud thrown \up. Small
damage was done in several places
along the routes taken by the parts
of the boiler by fire falling, but these
were quickly extinguished.
While the realization of what
might have been the result left room
for little other than serious thought
about the occurrence, it is said that
on first hearing the terrific explosion, ^ v
shaking houses for some distance ~
around, the conjecture of some was
that one of the huge guns used in
the European war was being tested
to ascertain the degree of its effectiveness
on a town like Orangeburg.
British Black Troope.
? 5
If as a result of the vast attrition ' :v |5
of the European armies the British
forces should suffer for lack of men
undoubtedly the great reserves of '
black and brown men in South Africa.
India, Egypt and other southern
parts of the empire would be utilized.
Already the British Government has
brought to Prance, to serve in the
hrmy service corps behind the lines,.
ten thousand African natives. The
utility of natives of / the southern
'' '' ^88
climes for service corps work is not ?
to be doubted. They are better fitted
for such duties, where only routine is .
required, than Anglo-Saxon soldiers.
The South African natives are recruit
ed and organized on military lines,. - ?
with white officers, and the experiment
is being watched with keenest
interest in Britain. If successful the
vast black and brown races under the
British flag may be brought into war
service. In fact, many British members
of Parliament are now urging
the recruiting of blacks for fighting.
A resolution was passed a couple of
weeks ago to this effect by a group
of members. The splendid fighting
qualities of the Soudanese and other
African tribes, such as the Zulus,
have never been doubted. The
French have generously used black
troops from their African colonies,
and the Germans feared them. If
there were a wide call to natives of
T-J;- "-J T3?: + A nACcaccinnQ
I Li Li 1CL CUi Li D1 lllOil mi ivau yvkTovwuAVMw
for service the status of the colored
races of the empire would be materially
altered, and their preponder- - r ^
ating millions would be attached to
the flag. Undoubtedly, if the need
arises, Britain would not hesitate to
call for help from that quarter,
though before it does arise the
United Kingdom and Dominions *
must put into play their available
strength.

Thirty-Nine Cent Cotton.
Mr. W. P. Baskin brought in a lot
of 20 bales of long staple cotton last
Monday. He sold seven bales at 39
cents and 13 bales at 38 cents. Mr.
Baskin is one of Lee county's most
successful growers of long staple cotton.
