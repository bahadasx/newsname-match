Governor Proclaim* Thanksgiving.
Gov. Manning signed the following
Thanksgiving day proclamation;
"While other nations and peoples
have suffered horrifying destruction
of life and property, and have endured
the stupendous catastrophes of
war, our people have enjoyed health,
peace and prosperity.
Our unbroken custom has been to
acknowledge by public act our gratitude
to Almighty Gor for mercies
yuochsafed us.
"Thanksgiving and prayers should
be accompanied by generous gifts for
the relief of those who are In distress
and of those In want.
"Now, therefore, I, Richard I. Manning,
governor of the 8tate of South
Carolina ,do appoint Thursday. November
30, 1916, as a day of thanksgiving
and prayer. On that day I urge our
people to lay aside business and labor,
repair to their places of worship,
lift up their hearts In fervent prayef
to God and express our gatitude by
contJbiitlhg to the relief of the suffering
and want of those who are in need
of our sympathy and aid."

ploor Tents For Militia.
W. W. Moore, adjutant general, is
preparing for the return of the First
regiment, National Guard of South
Carolina, to Camp Moore at Styx in
T.cYlntrfnn onnntu Thft roo-imonf Vina
been ordered back by the war department
and is expected to reach
Camp Moore ;n about 16 days. The
adjutant general was considering
plans for flooring the tents at Camp
Moore.
Opinion was divided in military
circles as to tyhether an order for the
return of the second regiment will be
issued in a few days. The opinion
was expressed that Troop A, cavalry,
Charleston Light Dragoons, will be
kept on the border for several nioqti}*<
because of thq great efficiency of the
unit.
It is probable that Capt. J. M. Graham,
U. S. A., who has been on duty
at mobilization camps in the north,
will be ordered back to Columbia to
muster out the South Carolina troops.
He is the inspector-instructor of the
South Carolina National Guard, and
was detailed temporarily to the y^tk
in the north
The adjutant general said that Camp
Moore 1b in fairly good condition for
the reception of the troops. Floors
for the tents is the immediate need of
the camp and Gen. Moore is now
making estimates as to the cost of the
work for the department ul me east.
"I believe that the troops will be
returned to South Carolina in about.
10 days," said the adjutant general,
'i'he actual mustering out of the var*
ious companies will require sqvernl
weeks. It i? safe to say that the men
and officers of the Fir^t regiment,
after three months' duty on the bov
der. will be returned to their home
stations early In December.
The First regiment is now considered
one of the best in the border service.
The companies won high praise
from the officers in command.

merely replicas ir\ $vk>r

saying that it is a thing that "anybody

that anybody whq baa the skill, time,
zeal and money to devote to it can accomplish
it. The process of direct color
photography still remains, ip pjrac-.

it cannot yet be duplicated

is a much more expensive
thing than ordinary photography.
