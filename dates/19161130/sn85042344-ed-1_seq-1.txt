DO YOU KNOW WHAT
REAL FREEDOM IS?
'Educating for Freedom" the
Topic of Zueblin's Able
Lecture.
FREE MEN ARE VERY SCARCE
The School Teacher the Vital
Force in Bringing the
Race to Ideal.
By ISKN NEWS' 'MR.)
A SMALL but very appreciative au
dience gathered at Convention
hall last night to hear Charles Zeublin
of Huston speak on freedom. The
speaker was Introduced by President
Knrnier of the liotary club in a short
talk on Kotariauisiu. The drirt of Mr.
Zueblin's argument was that the road
to freedom lay through tho school
house, but that tho school itself must,
be emancipated Itself from medieval
methods before that could be attained.
The lecture thruntit was so ivoi.Iy
good that it is hard for the reporter to
do It justice und the best that cap bo
done Is to touch the high places.
1'cw Arc l"r'c.
To begin with he asserted that he
has very seldom met a free man or
woman, l'o vou know what freedom
is? Vincent Ator with his Inherited
millions is not free, but Is tied down
bv his possessions. Can any ma, be
free who inherits Js, null 000? M iny
men nro not free as long as they have
Jx. U'e cannot be free Amol leans
w hile menial and humiliating !' ices
are needed to keep soul and body to
gether. Instances of such great dis
tress are less common now, because
we are all getitim rich making Imple
ments of murder for our cousins
across the water.
Wliat Is Our Heritage?
We speak of this heritage of tho
ages, ours Is specifically the Inher
itance of the wonderful nineteenth
centu'-y, and three of those legacies
lire our Industrial system, our demo
cratic spirit and our cosmic snnse.
'j'heso have not liberated us. Kven
lure In prosperous Oklahoma, where
even the man of common Intelligence
can hardly escape being rich, we cour
not live overnight without the supplies
we gather from other sources. We are
bound up by capital which has done
many wonderful things, but has not
made us happy. "r democratic spirit
Is a different thing from democratic
organization. The Oklahoma consti
tution gave the old foslls of the east
tho blind staggers, but it has not given
w. self-government. The newspapers
are roundly criticised but they can'
print so often and always tell the
truth tliev don't have time to verify.
The movies relieve tis from the neces
Mty of thinking. The essence ot de
mocracy Is mediocrity the common
place. Other countries are better gov
erned than ours, but have not our
democratic spirit.
Iteaciiing for the Infinite.
Our urasp on tho infinite Is morn
attenuated than on the dollar. Jtoady
miirto philosophy does not satisfy,
neither (loos socialism or nnarchv.
The control of all things bv tho mind
is ii farce. So what are we going to
give our children a culture that Is
founded in tho superstition of eign
hundred years ago, or something loss'.'
We educate for occupation, for good
citizenship. I'o we achieve It The
universities do not do It. Great men
may come out of tho little red school-
house, hut they go! their real educa
tion In the world College training
gives us calm of mind, but rubbing up
against the world is whut makes u
man worth while.

Turkeys Drop to Five

Fight to Reach Them
J lTTSIU'LOH. Pa., Nov. 2D
Competition between hucksters
and speculators handling turkeys
on the Water-street wharf which
resulted In the price of live birds
being reduced to u cents n pound
caused police reserves to ho
called out today to prevent cus
ton ers In their eagerness to buy
from sweeping the dealers into
tho Monongahelu river,
The price cutting was caused
bv a dispute among tho poultry
handlers regarding what price
should bo asked. During the ex
citement one dealer sold turkevs
without weighing them, demand
ing u certain sum for each bird.
Many spoculalors who brot largo
shipments of turkeys to Pitts
burgh, btlloving they would Iti
able lo Hocuie roeord-bro tk'eg
priies for them, left tho city to
night suffering heavy financial
losses hecunse of tho refusal of
the public to pav the prices they
demanded. In other parts of the
city live turkeys sold ut from 2,1
to 2H cents a pound.
