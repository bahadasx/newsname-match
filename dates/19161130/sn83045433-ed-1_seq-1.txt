SEES RATE FIGHT
Adamson Says Laws May Pass
. Unguarded Congress.
"You can pour water an a rack and
the rock will finally wear out, and just
o you can devil and devil Congress until
almost any legislation may slip through
in an' unguarded moment."
Thus spoke Representative Adanmo
father of the Adamson eight-hour law,
before a body of Washington business
men In the Builders' and Manufacturers'
Exchange last night.
"And so you may know the next move
of the railroad officials in fighting the
eight-hour law." he continued. "They will
fight and holloa and holloa and fight to
get licreased freight rates under the pre
text that the eight-hour law will mean
Increased expenses.
"If only the Pallroad officials behave
themselves and obey the law they will
be the most popular people in creation.
I often tell them that it would be a
good thing for them to study law for a
while. But we are gradually making
them admit that regulation in the proper
thing."
Representative Adamson emphasised
that his bill became a law as an element
of public safety and was not intended
to legislate on an Issue between capital
and labor.
He cited facts showing some engineers
had worked as long as thirty hours on
one run, with the result that there gen
erally were wrecks because "the engi
neer'. head was not clear and his hand
was not steady."
"If we sleep on a Pullman while the
train is rushing through the night," said
Representative A p 'as have a
right to have all Metrainmen in their

them."

LANS HIS OWN DEATH
WITH INFINITE PAINS
Marks Place to Stand with Chalk;
Gets Load in Heart.
!'y the Interatleonal News Service.
New York. Nov. 29-With as much care
as If he had been in his right mind, An
drew H. Duryea strapped a loaded shot
gun to the rear of his father's automo
bile.
Presently he had it secured firmly in
such a way that the barrel pointed over
the she of the left rear wheel at a con
venient angle to shoot a man in the
heart.
No one saw him as he pottered away
ait his complicated task in the garage on
the estate of his father, Horace G. Dur
yea. at Glen Head. Long Island. this aft
ernoon.
It was the first time he had been left
ungarded since he was taken home
from a sanitarium two months previous
ly.
To the trigger of the gun he tied one
end of a long piece of string, passed the
other end round a spoke of the right rear
wheel of the car and brought It taut to
the left side. where he intended to stand.
Electing to stand about four feet from
the muzzle of the gun. he took the
trouble to mark the exact place for his
feet with a piece of chalk.
And then he stood upright and pulled
the string.
His plan worked perfectly. The charge
entered his heart and he dropped' dead.
