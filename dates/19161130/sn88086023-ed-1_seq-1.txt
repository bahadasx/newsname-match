WASHINGTON, Nov. 30. It la

vals suggested the following remedies:
An embargo or law compelling food
dealers to sell ten per cent of their to.

commission investigation of the whot
situation with recommendations. It
is believed President Wilson and cabi

an embargo. Representative Jeff Mc

embargo is possible without a bitter
