Catarrhal Deafness Cannot Be Cured
by local applications, as they can

caused by an inflamed condition
of the mucous- lining of the

hearing; aiid when it 'is entirely

Unless the inflammation can be
reduced and the tube restored to
Its normal vctmdition hearing
will be destroyed forever. "iMahy

to bring forth a good illustration
as he thought, so he took a wal

holding it up in the 'course of his

"My friends, you see this vval
j nut. Well, the outer hull is like
Ithe Methodists, soft and spongy,
with no strength in it. See, 1 can

suiting action to the words, he
