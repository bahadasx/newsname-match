OPERATION FATAL
T0J3E0RGE KING
George King the Santa Fe con
ductor who was badly injured
in the railroad yards in Wil
liams a few days ago and was
taken to the Santa Fe Hospital
at Los Angeles for treatment
died near noon last week Wed
nesday morning, Nov. 22. The
operation was performed Tues
day evening. Mr. King re
mained under the influence of
anesthetics until Wednesday
morning. Death resulted from
what is known as the second
shock. It is the opinion of
some that had the operation
been performed at once death
might not have resulted. It is
the rule with the Santa Fe,
however, that operations must
be performed at a Santa Fe
hospital.
George King began work
'with the Santa Fe as an oper
ator in 1912 under Mr. W. D.
Finney at Albuquerque. In
1907 he asked to be transfer
red to train service for the ben
efit of his health. Beginning
as brakeman, he was promoted
to extra conductor in 1910 and
such he was at thet ime of his
death.
Mr. King leaves a wife aid
two children.

THE MARSHAL BROKE
UP THE PARTY
Marshal Bobby Burns re
ports that he broke up a very
interesting party last Satur
day night near the Town jail
about the hour of 12. A
crowd of Williams' toughs
who would, doubtless, claim
to be genuine Americans, were
engaged in roughing it with a
bunch of Mexicans and were
getting the worst of it. The
marshal put one of the Ameri
cans in jail and Judge Sine fin
ed him $5.00 for drunkenness
Monday morning. The Mex
icans quickly vanished.
T
OF
Executive Department
of Arizona
State
Since that memorable day in
America's Jristory when ouran
cestors foregathered on the
bleak shores of New England
and there proclaimed their
gratitude in unison to Almigh
ty God for all those blessings
f providentially bestowed upon
them, it has been the custom of
the American people to set a
part annually a day for the
rendering of thanks to the Cre
ator in fitting recognition of di
vine, mercies and benefactions.
This custom, universally ap
proved, is properly perpetuat
ed in the State of Arizona and
observance thereof is com
mended by law.
It is particularly seemly that
Arizona's citizens should cele
brate, in the present year, the
annual day of Thanksgiving,
for harvests have been bounti
ful, and the pursuits of indus
try have been fruitful beyond
compare. In other ways, also,
than those of merely material
benefit the people of the state
have been abundantly and pro
videntially favored.
NOW, THEREFORE, I.
GEO. W. P. HUNT, Governor
of Arizona, by virtue of the au
thority in me vested, do pro
claim and set aside Thursday,
November the 30th, 1916, as
Thanksgiving Day. .It is ur
gently recommended that on
the day thus set apart, all the
people of A.rfaona shall unite
in giving reverent thanks to
God for the peace and prosper
ity which abide within our
State, and that faith in theun
derlying purpose of divinity
which portends the ultimate
salvation of humanity.
IN" WITNESS WHEREOF,
I have hereunto set
my hand and caused
thegreat seal of the
. State of Arizona to
SEAL be affixed.
Done at Phoenix,
the Capital, this 24th
day of November, A.
D., 1916.

A TRIBUTE . TO MR. FORD
In an interview with Thos.
A. Edison, published inol
liers Weekly in the issue dated
Dec. 2, Mr. Edison among oth
er things, says of Mr. Ford,
"Henry's critics tell him that
for him to pay wages of five,
six and seven dollars a day is
suicidal, but I tell you that
Henry is no fool. He knows
what he is doing. He is get
ting his work done at the low
est wages in the UnitedStates.
I am paying my men three
dollars, and he pays seven, yet
I believe he is getting more for
his money than I am. The reas
on for this is that he multiplies
the effectiveness of his men's
work by the use of machinery.
Very few people realize what
possibilities lie in the invention
of new machinery to solve the
problems of labor. Henry
knows. He is a natural born
mecnamc n mere ever was
i it
one."

Another Clothesline Robbed
i
Mrs. Emerson, south Fifth St.,
probably had not heard of
Mrs. Morehead's loss of $25
worth of clothes from her line
Saturday night else she would
not have left hers out Monday
night. Some thievish prowler
took everything from her line
on that night and left no trace.
Her loss is heavy and includes
two new bedspreads and much
clothing of good quality.
RAILROADS ORDER
35,000 FREIGHT CARS
CHICAGO, Nov. 29, It is
learned that the big; railroads
in the first three weeks of Nov.
ordered 35,000 new freight
cars andt a ' number of locomo
tives most of the orders being
for delivery in one year. The
car builders and locomotive
builders are crowded with or
ders only for delivery in the fu
ture. The above orders in
volve ,an expenditure of $500,
000,000. Jack London Dead
Jack London the noted auth
or, died at his home at Glen
Springs California, on Novem
ber 23. London would have
been 41 years old on January
12. He is survived by his wife,
a daughter, a sister and his
mother.
Coyote Stock Going Up
The demand for fur has be
come so great that many ani
mals heretofore not highly es
teemed for their skins are now
in demand. The coyote is a
mong the number. Killed in
the past because of being a
nuisance or for a paltry bounty
he may now be hunted and kil
led for the price his hide will
bring. Dressed and dyed coy
ote skins resemble expensive
fox furs and theyl are. sold as
an imitation to those unable to
pay the prices demanded for
fox furs. The less desirable
coyote skins find their way to
the battlefields of Europe and
are used as lining for the great
coats of the soldiers in the
trenches.
Hunt down the coyotes and
kill two birds with one stone.
You will rid the country of a
destructive pest which kills
both, cattle and sheep and fill
your purse, for the demand for
their hides is good and the
price is high.
THE NEWS HAS INSTALLED
Linotype
NO HURRY
While the representatives of
the Coconino Water Develop
ment and Stock Company inti
mated that Williams would
have to act quickly to get wa
ter from the San Francisco
Mountains project , there is,
the News feels sure, nothing in
such intimation. This Com
pany has water to sell. The
water is largely undeveloped,
but it looks reasonable from
the facts presented to the Wil
liams investigating committee,
that the; supply may be unlim
ited by development. ' Mr.
Spencer claimed, 2,000,000 gal
lons and more each year as the
possible output of the project.
The figures of the company's
engineer indicate that the pos
sible supply of water is much
larger than Mr. Spencer has
conservatively put it. Be that
as it may, the company will
have water to sell after north
ern Arizona has been supplied,
that is, all that portion of
northern Arizona which may
be put under the company's
pipes.
There should be no unneces
sary delay in securing good wa
ter for Williams but there need
be no haste in dealing with the
development company. They
have water to sell and custom
ers will be just as welcome a
little later as now.

type typesetting machine pic
tured on this page, means an
increased capacity for news in
your local paper. For that
reason we solicit your fuller co
operation in gathering all local
and personal items of public
interest, for publication in the
columns of the News. This,
that the paper may be made
more interesting and more val
uable to all, and a better draw
ing card for the town.
Reports and notices of all
churches, lodges and other
public benefit organizations,
and notices of all social func
tions and activities are especi
ally solicited.
Write up the notices or news
of which you have knowledge
and send them in, or call 44
and tell us about them. Your
efforts will be appreciated by
the News and will be a source
of much interest and satisfac

Remem, just a word over
the phone and those items you
would like to - see published
will not be overlooked.
T AT
THE BOX FACTORY
.. The Saginaw & Manistee
Lumber Company is making
improvements in its box facto
ry 'hich, when completed will
contribute very much - to - its
efficiency. The improvements
consist in a, general rearrange
ment of machinery rather than
in the introduction of new ma
chinery. Only one new piece
will be installed : a new planer.
The rearrangement of the ma
chinery will enable the plant
to increase the output without
increasing the cost. Indeed, it
is expected that the improve
ments will greatly increase the
productivity of each , laborer,
a thing that is imperative with
factories that would keep a
breast with the times. : ..'
The extent of gain in the in
creased efficiency for which
the company is working can
not be definitely estimated for
the reason as General Fore
man Carlson told the News,
that the improvement is to a
degree experimental. They
are sure of a gain, of course,
or the improvements would not
have been undertaken, but the
gain' cannot be measured until
the machinery as rearranged
shall have been tried out.
That the Saginaw should
have shut down the machinery
of its box factory to undertake
an experimental alteration in
the plant is significant and in
dicates that the company is
fully alive to the demand of
the age for largest possible re
turn for the investment of
power.
Shipping Horses to Phoenix
Gus and Frank Poison, Jim
Smith, Yoder and Robinson are
shipping their saddle horses to
Phoenix for the winter. The
horses will be put in pasture
there.

WILLIAMS TO HAVE
Clifford Klock Formerly in the
Employ of the News, Plans
to Launch upon Sea of -Journalism
in new publication
"the Williams Times"
On December 1st, it is plan
ned, the journalistic sky shall
be brightened by the birth of
a new star "The Williams
Times," Clifford Klock pub
lisher and owner. The puubli
cation will be a four page
weekly devoted to advancing
the interests of Williams and .
of Northern Arizona.
Mr Klock has been actively
engaged for the last month in
making preparations for this .
new venture. He purchased
an extra job press, a paper cut
ter, type, case racks andt other
printing materials from the
News office, andto these has .
since added a new Diamond '
press, a stock of paper and ad
ditional type, rule and other
necessary articles. With this
equipment as a nucleus, Mr.
Klock expects to continue ad- :
ding to his plant, out of the
profits of his business, until he
has a thoroly modern office in"
every particular. He is locat
ed in the room at the rer ,of
the Sultana pool hall. The
Times is to issue on Fridays.
Mr. Klock learned the print- ,
er's trade in the News office
where he has worked off and x
on for the last two and a half
years. He has lately come by
a little capital and decided to
put it to work at once. After
taking a survey of the newspa
per field of Northern Arizona, .
Mr. Klock decided that the
best opening now available lies
in Williams. " He feels that
there is an element in this town
which has failed to secure' rep
resentation in the News, and
he . proposes to . give', them a ,
voice. Satisfied that there is
room for two papers in the
town, he avers that the future
of the Williams Times appears
very promising.
Mr. Klock has a good gram
mar school education, and has
continued his studies since
quitting school. As a boy he
showed great talent in a liter
ary way, -especially in the
production of short stories.
While his style proved too
vigorous for the conservative
magazines to which he sub
mitted his fiction, it should be
only strong and convincing in
the newspaper field. His num
erous friends are not at all sur'
prised to see him enthusiasti
cally leaping into the journal
istic arena. , , . '
Mr. Klock is editor-in-chief
and general manager of this -new
publication, and he will be
ably assisted b'y his wife, Mrs.
Nellie Riemer Klock, and by
his brother John who has come , ,
up from Winslow to assist him.
The News joins with his many
friends in wishing him a bril
liant career.
Henry Ford is a mighty use
ful man. Having contributed
to the downfall of the brewers
in Michigan, he would save the
stockholders from ruin by con
verting the breweries into the
plants needed for distilling de
natured alcohol for motive
power. Henry says it will pay
and what Henry says on the
subject goes.
