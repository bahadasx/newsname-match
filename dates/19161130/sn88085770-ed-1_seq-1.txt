TO RE REVIVED
BY PRESIDENT
Increase in Powers of Interstate
Commerce Commission Will
He Put Up to Congress
President Wilson is contemplating
n revival of his program of railroad
legislation, in connection with the re
vival of trouble between the railroad
unions and the companies. He will
confer with Representative W. C. Ad
asason, author of the eight hour law,
as a preliminary to his legislative ac
tivities.
Foremost among the President's
plans is the granting of additional in
tissue in railroad freight rates, to
meot the increased expenditures in
wages and in other reforms.
The President's tentative legisla
tive program, as announced last slim
mer by administration circles, is as
follows:
To Widen 1. C. C Powers
The enlargement and reorganiza
tion of the powers of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
Approval by Congress of the plan
that the commission consider freight
rate increases.
Compulsory arbitration in labor dis
putes, carrying with it a legal man
date against the resort to strike or
lockout until such investigation
proves unavailing.
I odgement in the President's
hands of power to confiscate railroad
property for military purposes.
Opposed to the inherent principle
of the President's avowed plans is the
declaration by the organized labor
movement that compulsory arbitra
tion, with denial of th eright to strike,
will not be tolerated.
RUSSIA'S LOSS IN MEN
2,128,476 IN HALF YEAR
The semi-official Transocean News
News Bureau quotes the Central Iden
tification Bureau of Kieff as stat
ing that the number of Russian cas
ualties since June 1 of this year had
reached 100,621 officers and 2,027,858
men, a total of 2,128,470.
Among the superior officers recent
ly fallen, it is stated, were one gen
eral of brigade, four colonels and
four lieutenant colonels, commanders
of regiments. It is likewise stated that i
part of the Russian forces in the Cau
casus have recently been transferred
to the European theater of war.
The Bicknell (Indiana) Co-opera- !
tive Society has just issued their first I
quarterly report. They had been in j

a membership of 82 and their mem
b«rthip now is 133. Their stock own
ership has doubled, and after clear
ing all expenses they had something
like $400 profit for that length of
time, which is a remarkable showing,
considering that it is the first three
months of the existence of their store.
They are rapidly increasing their
membership, and the prospects for the
future could not be much brighter.

LATEST MOVE OF
BIG INTERESTS
Gigantic Battle to He Staged Between
* a |>i(al and Labor
Backed by $8,000,000,000 capital
and including in its membership 18,
--000 officials of corporations belonging
to twelve of the largest national as
social ions of industrial employers,
the National industrial Conference
Board has been organised in Now
York to combat the interests of labor.
It is believed this is the initial step
in :i gigantic battle between capita!
and labor which will prove mipnral
[leled in history for its magnitude and
■ importance. The firms represented In
I the new organization employ approx
i imately 7,000,000 workers.
'('.< Fight Eight-Hour Law
It is understood that one of the
primary purposes of the board is to
fight the eight-hour law relentlessly.
William 11. Hair, of Buffalo, made the
following significant statement:
"The development of the past year
politically and industrially emphasize
:. '; ' r before the need of more com
prehensive co-opSrative action in in
dustry."
Hoard to Ho Advisory
The scope of tho board's activities
will be purely advisory, and the sep
arate associations represented in it
will act separateh when occasion war
■ s. It is felt that employers' asso
ciations have divided their efforts too
much in the past and that the- board
wil' give them a weapon to unite their
strength.
The ■■■ : of the board will be very
wide. It will watch all legislation and
the activities of such labor organiza
tions as the American Federation of |
Labor.

Anchorage Union Hall To He

A few weeks ago the Union Labor
hall of Anchorage, Alaskf;, was burn

had previously shown j its strength,
so the merchants knew that it was
foolish to oppose it, so v -i>ii the call
was made for funds to h-jlp put up a
new Union labor hall tliv merchants
were the first to roßDon>>
They knew that well-paid men were
a great asset to the city They knew
that miserably paid wage slaves were
a detriment to the well-icing of the
city, so they hustled around to put or
ganized labor into a new hall.
Donations, according to the last is
sue of the Alaska Labor News,
amount to $7,l<iH..'i. r>, and in going over
the list of contributors we find that
the following amounts v'ere received
from the number of business men

EUROPEAN WAR
AIDS SOCIALISM
Belgian Socialist Tells Hearers
That All Workers Will Unite
After Struggle
"The capitalists of Europe are edu
cating the working people of Europe !
to be Socialists," Henri La Fontaine, |
Socialist Senator of Belgium, said at I
a lecture given recently under the di- j
rection of the 18th Assembly District
Socialists of Brooklyn, 853 Flatbush
avenue.
"By the fixed prices, by the gov
ernment ownership of commodities,
by the better care that they receive
in war-time, they are so training the
people that they will turn to Social
ism naturally after the war. The co
operative movement, that had already
been started and that had been
brought into the party, has been
strengthened by the war.
"Wil in Europe are looking to
America for a stronger group to take
a bigger place in the International
party when the Germans and allies
shall again unite. There is not enough
done in America to educate the peo
ple in the work. Over in Belgium
there is a Socialist bakery that sends
out 80,000 loaves of bread a week,
and every one of the men who deliver
the bakery goods has been trained to
(In propaganda work in all the homes
that he reaches; he has time to stop
i'H a little chat."
Another point that La Fontaine em
phasized was the fact that the Ameri
can Socialist paid too much attention
i to the phenomena and too little to the
I noumena. In other words, we have
emphasized the Marxian theory as to
economic government, and have spent
SO much time preaching for the bet-
I ter means to an end, that it has be
leome the end itself. He urges, in still
| other words, more attention to the
spiritual life, the uplift of humanity,
not only out of economic slavery, but
out of mental slavery.

A loiter from Kail Liebknecht, the
German Socialist lender who was sen

treason placed against him by the
li M isian court-martial, and in which
he stall's his position against war and
against the government with the
sublime courage of an inspired leader
of the working class.
He accuses the imperial German
governmeni of treachery to the
masse; of Germany, of inhuman
cruelty to its enemies and its own
people, and charges himself with the
work of expressing the cries of tor
fine ami anguish of the masses of
Germany and of other warring na
tions.
lie Predicts Upheaval
He expresses faith in the interna
tional Socialist movement and in the
people of his own country. He pre
did an upheaval and a future for the
International brotherhood of man.
His indictment again his country
condensed, but in substance, are as
follows:
"The German government is an in
strument for the oppression ° and ex
ploitation of the masses. It serves
only the interests of the junkers, the
capitalists and imperialists.
"It is the ruthless exponent of
world power, the strongest factor in
the race for military power, and for
this reason one of the chief instiga
tors of this war.
"It tricked the masses, and even
the Reichstag, at the outset of the
war, and seeks now to sustain the er
ror amonK the people (concealing the
ultimatum to Belgium, censoring the
Czar's telegram of July, 1914, pub
lished in the German white book.)
Conducts Monstrous War
"The government conducts a war
monstrous even by the standards of
other wars, as shown in the invasion
of Belgium and Luxembourg, ruth
less Zeppelin warfare, submarine war,
torpedoing of the Lusitania, flogging
and fining systems now in practice in
Belgium, using of prisoners as spies
and traitors, notably among the Uk- ,
ranians, Geogians, Polish, Irish and '
Mohammedan prisoners and in par
ticular in the negotiations between ,
Sir Roger Casement and Vice-Secre- i
tary Zimmerman to equip an 'Irish ;
brigade' of English prisoners; com- i
pulsion of interned civilians to be
come traitors under the slogan, 'Need
recognizes no law.'
"The German government has in
creased the misery of the Polish
masses in occupied territory, it hin
ders every political and social reform,
while keeping the political parties
powerless under the pledge of neces
sity.
"It denies agricultural improve
ments and has caused terrible distress
among the farming masses.
Feeds Public on Lies
"The German government, even at
this time, has not relinquished the
idea of conquest, and makes this the
chief obstacle to peace negotiations;
it stifles criticism and feeds the pub
lic on lies."
Then Liebknecht declares that the
slogan, "Down with the government,"
used in his" address on -May Day, sum
marized these complaints to arouse
workmen to their class interest
against those conducting the war.
Continuing, he writes, in substance:
"The present war cannot claim to
be a war of defense or for the libera
tion of a nation, or for the benefit of
the masses.
"To the proletariat it measures
only the extreme concentration of po
ll! ical oppression and industrial ex
ploitation and the slaughter of the
working class for the capitalists and
imperialists.
But One Answer
"There can be but one answer by
the working class—increased activ
ity against the capitalist government
to end exploitation and to end the war.
The Socialist whose country is the
world can have no other duty.
"The slogan, 'Down with war,' ex
■ the opposition to the present
war, its causes and methods and its
consequences, and is the only stand a
Socialist can take.
"As a Socaialist, I am fundamen
tally opposed to the war, the prevail
ing militarism, and 1 have conducted
myself against them as my special
duty, because it is a vital problem of
the working class of all countries."

RAILROADS USE
WORKERS FOR
ANTI-STRIKE LAW
Induces Its Slaves to Sign Peti-
tion Under False (iuise
The railroad owners are getting
ready to forge a new chain around the
necks of their employes. Knowing
that President Wilson has promised
them a compulsory arbitration law,
and hoping to force such a law
through congress by making it ap
pear that a majority of the railroad
employes favor it, the railway own
ers have inspired the formation of a
committee of employes, called "The
Eighty Per Cent," which is sending
out a petition asking for compulsory
ariiitiation.
Committee Issues Appeal
The executive committee of "The
Eighty Per Cent," of which Robert T.
Frazier is chairman and P. K. Walden,
-secretary, sends out an appeal in a
circular letter. This letter complains
that the Eight-Hour" wage bill passed
by congress and signed by President
Wilson, does not provide for a real
eight-hour day, but merely increases
the wages of 20 per cent of the rail
way employes by 25 per cent. This
wage raise for 20 per cent of the rail
way employes, says the letter, gives a
small minority more than double the
wages received by the other 80 per
cent of the railway employes.
The commission to be appointed by
the president, the letter continues,
will not investigate whether the 80
per cent of the railway employes are
entitled in justice to a raise, but will
merely find out whether the railroads
can operate at a profit, if the 20 per
cent of the railway employes received
a 25 per cent raise.
Should Raise All Wages
The "Eighty Per Cent," whose
has been formed, the letter continues,
for the express purpose of obtaining
I signatures for a petition demanding
1 that the president's commission shall
consider all the railway employes, not
; merely the 20 per cent, and shall in
! vestigate all hours of service and the
i wages of all employes, with power to
fix an equitable scale of compensation
for all.
The "Eeighty Per Cent," whose
headquarters is at 820 Transportation
building, Chicago, assert that they are
employed in railway service handling
interstate transportation of every
character, including the United States
mails, men and munitions for the
army and navy.
To secure their ends "The Eighty
Per Cent" send out a petition to the
president and congress of the United
States and asks for signatures of all
who favor their demands.
For Compulsory Law
"We are among the 80 per cent of
the employes of the railways," the pe
tition says, "who are not actually en
gaged in train and yard service.
"The average compensation of this
80 per cent of the employes is less
than half the average compensation
of those engaged in the train and yard
service.
"Many of us have more hours of
service than do the train and yard
men and the work which most of us
perform is more laborious than their
work. Equal or greater skill—acquir
jed through a longer period of train
ing—is required for the performance
of the work of many of us than is
necessary to do the work of the train
and yard employes.
"On September 2. 1916, the con
gress enacted a law which was, on the
following day, approved by the presi
dent, which will ha\e the effect of in
creasing the wages of train and yard
service men about 25 per cent, with
out in any way protecting the 80 pc
cent. When this law becomes effect
ive on January 1, 1917, the chance-;
for betterment of the condtion of the
80 per cent will be diminished by rea
son of the great tax upon the reve
nues of the railroads in paying this 25
per cent ■ o the train and yard
service employes.

POLITICAL ARENA
TO SEE LABOR'S
WAR ON CAPITAL
IJne-up of Organized Groups
Will (enter Around 8-Hour
Fight and Arbitration
By Gilson Gardner
The federation of capital against
the federation of labor is the obvious
line up in the biggest problem to be
worked out in Washington this win
ter—the problem involved in the ap
plication of the eight-hour law to the
railroads, and the supplemental ques
tion of compulsory arbitration.
Around this legislation will come
the line-up of business on the one
side and labor on the other. The old
talk about labor and capital being
'lirothers" and "friendly co-workers"
-that slogan of the National Civic
Federation—has been dropped, The
antagonism of interests, the clash of
selfishness is in the open.
Here are the developments in the
line-up for the coming struggle:
The formation of the National In
dus! rial Conference Board; the gen
e ;il plan for co-operation between
the railroads and the Chamber of
Commerce of the United States; the
Founders' Association, and other
lines of big- business which heretofore
have conducted their labor fights in
dependently.
On the other side is the drawing
together of the American Federation
of Labor, the Railroad Brotherhood,
the Labor Defense Council, certain of
the farmers' organizations and the
.Socialist party groups.
A part of the same fight is the ef
fort on the part of the railroads, vig
orously suported by the Chamber of
Commerce, to secure Federal incor
poration of railroads, the abolition of
the power of the State railway com
missions,, and the wiping away of
their power to enforce "full crew"
laws, taxation provisions, limitations
of rates, and state legislation protect
ing the workers.
Another important phase of the
itruggle is looming. Big business is
demanding the passag eof the Webb
bill and other legislation authorizing
combinations of capital to exploit for
eijm markets; while on the other side
labor and the lower middle class in
terests are demanding relief from the
pressure of increased cost of living,
and are turning to the possibility of
embargoes on food exports and gov
ernmental regulation of prices; gov
ernment operation of railroads and of
industries controlling the supply of
foodstuffs.
MOVIE PATRONS GIVEN
TWO TONS OF COAL TO
TAKE OFF THEATER BAN
PHILADELPHIA.—Two tons of in
nocent-looking, jet black coal that
proved to be a Jonah were given away
free at the Majestic Palace, motion
picture theater.
The presence of the coal, purchased
from a company that happens to be
afflicted with a strike of its union
drivers, offended the "movie" patrons.
It wasn't "union" coal. So they boy
cotted the "movie."
By a strategic stroke the manager
turned the impending disaster into a
popular victory. Men, women and chil
dren with toy express wagons, buck
ets, wheel-barrows, baskets, baby
coaches, sacks and boxes swarmed to
the "movie" in 'response to the fol
lowing- sign displayed in front.
"We bought from M. Weis two tons
of coal. When the coal arrived at the
theater we discovered that it was
Newton coal.
"We don't want it.
"We will give this Newton coal
away. Bring your baskets and buckets
and carry it home."
It was all a mistake, a member of
the striking drivers' union explained.
The manager wasn't aware the agent
represented the Newton company, he
said, adding that because the cinemat
ograph operator is a union man the
place is 0. K.
v successful financier is a man
who can separate other men from
their money without the aid of a
sandbag.
conditions of work, hours of service
and wages."
The last sentence in this petition
reveals the real powers behind it. By
demanding compulsory arbitration
the "Eeighty Per Cent" actually ask
for slavery to the railway owners and
<;pive up all the power already gs
by organized employes in the railway
ice.
It is evident that the real purpose
of the railroad owners, working
through "The Eighty Per Cent," is
to tie down the organized brother
hoods by a compulsory arbitration
law, to demand higher passenger and
ht rates, and then to start a
fight on organized labor, after
pulsory arbitration ha:, deprived the
unions of the right to strike.
