BIGREDUCTION
IN FOOD PRICES
Speculators, Because
of Campaign, Face
$500,000 Loss
FIRST DECLINF
IN TURKEYS
Foreign Agents Fager to
Buy Fggs Forced Down
by Food Boycott
When the N'ew York housewifp surns
up the things for which she is thank
ful to-day it is. more than Hkely that
?he will first mention the fact that, by
her own efforts, she has compelled the
reduction in the market price of nearly
every article that entered into to-day'
dinner, that she has forced an increase
in the city's supply of visible food and
that prospects of even lower prictl
are before her.
She may not be so thankful for th!<
beir.g of a forgiving nature but she
actually caused food speculators' losses
yesterday estimated at anything from
$200,000 to $500,000. All evidence last
night pointed to still further los-.es
for the New York speculators, as food
was being hurried from all sorts of
hoarding places to sa\e Ita owners
from even more seriou* results of thr
uprising of consume^s.
First signs of the success of the cru
sade agninst high price* came early in
the day, when the turkey market sud
denly dropped from 4 to 6 cents a
pound on the wholesale quotations.
Komethir.g approarhing a panic among
the commission merrhants ensued and
local represenUtives of thippers kept
the wire? hot with messages advising
them to take what they could get and
save themselves from big losses.
Down to 30 Cents a Pound
By noon butchers were buying the
hest grade of turkeys for 30 cents a
pound and selling them 'or "* cents
and some as low as 3'2 exactly 6 cents
less than prices asked Tuesday and 10
cents less than those of a week ago.
But even at these prices the public
was indifferent so exasperatingly ko
that many of the hig -hippers were
compelled to place their stock in cold
storage, hoping that Christmas might
nee more favorable conditions.
Since cold storajre. shrinkage and
double handling ll expensive, it w
said by market experts that their losses
on turkeya already were tiemendous
and that they would he even greater
if the eonsumer continued to hold the
whip hand by refusing to pay high
prices.
L. P. Browri, director of the Bureau
of Food and Drugs of the Department I
of Health, confirmed positively through j
his investigators that thousands of !
turkeys were being placed in cold stor?
age by tht wholesalers.
"It seems that the big dealer has
for once been caught between the
farmer and the eonsumer ai.d has only
the chance of loslng monev any way
be turns," Mr. Brown said last night.
"The dealer estimated that th? turkey
supnlv would be unusuully short tliis
Thank?giving, so he offered high prices
to turkey raisera. But, instead. the
supply is norroal. The high prices de
manded make the housewife refuse to
buy. So, instead of selling his turkevs
at a reasonable proflt, it appcars that
the dealer is hurryinc them to cold
storage, where they will probably resl
in obscurity until prices rise again.
1916 Supply All Freah
"So ftf as we have been able to lesrn
there was not a single cold storage
turkey in the rity day before yesterday.
This yenr'v supply is all fresh, the stor?
age supply once intended for Thanks
givmg having been sold out severnl
months ago. The supplv of chiekens,
ducks and geese that came into the
citv ( r ThankRgiving was even above
normal tflll year.
With ihe domesfic uholesale trade
demorali7.?d by the eg? boycott, both
tho wholesale and re'.ail prices dropped
sharply yesterday. and agents for Hnt
,?h and French egg merchar.ts stepped
firward, with their tinger? on the pube
of the market.
By the wholesale, eggs sold off from
I to 2'i cents; the retail decline was
frcrn I to 4 cents. Should the car Iot
quotatiors go two cents lower, one
foreign buyer said he would take all
the egg* u (Jreenwich Strett rtrm can

Mrs. Julian Heath. president of the
National Housewives' l.eague, whic'u
?rgamzed the boycott, admittcd the
peril of a raid by cxporter.x on tne

create a real famine before epring.

"I realue the danger," said Mrs. |
Heath, "and confeaa that it makes me a

El Paso, Tex., Nov. It.?Scattered de
tachments of General Trevino's army,
which was driven from Chihuahua I
by Franci?co Villa, are being gatherel
by Ceneral Franciseo Gonzales and con
centrated at Suaz for reorganization.
Vtlla, in full possession of Chihua?
hua, is permitting no civilian to escaps
from that city. and with all wires cut,
Carranza officials to-night still WtM
in doubt as to the fate of foreigner
and re?ident<= who were accused by
Villa of aiding the C'arranza force- in
defending the city.
The first foreign refugee to Irave
t'hihuahua City since the siege began
arrived here to-day. He reported that
Villa and .Tulio Acosta were in control
of most of the nty when he made bil
escape by automobile at 2 o'clock thi
morning. Owing to the fact that hr
had been in hiding, he explained that
he had no means of knowing at first
hand just what had happened, or even
the whereabout- of fieneral Trevino.
Prepare to Meet Attack
With Villa forces moving north in
an evident determination to attark
Juarez and aecure control of all of
enstern < hihuahua terntory, Carranza
officials to-day gathered all available
strengtl. in men and muniUons for a
tinal effo'rt to check Villa's aweep over
the atate.
Villistai are already operating between
Juarez and the new (arranza base at
Suaz. and it is feared in Juarez they will
rut Ceneral Gonzale's reorganized army
from the border. A report reached El
i':tM> to-night that Vilhstas had burned
bridges on the Mexico Northwestern
Rnilioad between Juarez and Casas
(irandes, cutting General Pershing's
army off from securing supplies by rail
from El Paso. For months sereral
trainloade of supplies have been sent
each wesk to General Perahing over the
Mexico Northwestern, consigned to in
dividuals at Colonia Publan.
Signiftcance is attached to the report
from Western Chihuahua that civiliai
residents of towns near the American
army camps hate sent delegations to
General Pershing to plead for prot*c
tion against Villa bandits. All West?
ern Chihuahua towns hav? been aecu-w d
by Villa with aiding Ihe American army
and he has threatened to destroy the
towns and kill the natives as soor. as
the American army leaves. The with

CUT 20 MUIS
FROM CAPITAL
Defenders Flceing to
Bucharest in Wild
Rout, Berlin Says
PITESCI SEIZED
BY FALKENHAYN
Russians Attack in North
to Relicve Ally, but Blow
Seems Too Late
Lodon, Nov. 29.?The Rumanian
retreat is unchecked. Driving for
ward along the whole front from the
Transylvanian passes to the Danube,
the invading armies tightened the
hand of steel that is closing on
Bucharest.
Mackensen, moving against the
capital from the south, is now with
iti twenty miles of Bucharest. This
is admitted by Petrograd, which con
cedes the loss of four villagcs cast of
the Ziminicea-Alexandria line.
P"a!kenhayn has capturcd Pitessi,
??ixty miles northwest of Bucharest
nnd the converging point of four rail
ways. Hi* troops, who battered their
path through the Rumanian defence
wesi. of ('ampulung, thus have
reached the raihvay Ieading directly
to thr capital, and have joined forces
with the troops which push^d east
ward from Craiova. Apparently
they have advanccd twenty-five miles
in a day.
Heeing In Disorder
"The <lefeated army is retieating
Mftward in disorder," says Berlin
telling of "victorious advances," both
l.y I'alkenhayn and Mackensen, along
the entire line. There is no state
ment from Allied sources to contra
dict this assertion.
There is belated hope in the Rus?
sians, but observers her-1 doubt that
their effort can delay long the fall of
Buche t. The L'aar's troops struck
a heavy blow in the Carpathian
passes to-day, winning a series of
ridges around Kirlibaba and on the
Hungarian border and taking more
Iban TOO prisoners. The offensive is
l>oing kept up without pause.
Berlin reports that violent Russian
attacks yesterday on the Moldavian
front made gmall local gains at a heavy
cost. These efforts were repeated to
dav.
Doubt They ( an Sare Ally
It seems oertain that the Russians
will divert some of Falkenhayn'* forces
to the northern line, for if the Rus?
sians force their way through the
Rodna Pass or the Moldavian frontier
they will menace the Teutonic troops
in the rear. But whether the riiversion
will enable the Rumanians to make a
final stand before Bucharest and
eventually turn the tidc is extremely
doubtful.
Beyond the fact that both Mackcnsen
and Falkenhayn are pressing forward
with undiminished power the exact
DOtitiei of the armies battling for the
Rumanian capital is vague. While one
column is moving swiftly along the
Pitesci-Bucharest railway. the Danube
troops, composed of Bulgar* and
Turks, are advancing from Giurgiu
directly on the capital. These forces
yesterday took Kulugurena, which is
twenty miles south of the capital.
(ampulung Army in Peril
The tierman announcement that the
Rumanians are retiring in disorder. if
true, is the first sign that an orderly
retreat has been turned into ? rout.
The capture of Pitesci, sixty miles
from Bucharest, threatens the lasl Ru?
manian hold of the passes west of the
capital. The ( ampulung position
alrendy is taken in the rear. 1 here
has been no mention ?f the town's
.aptuie, and It 's foared tha*. the de
? faca csplure unless they can
, Mil(.tward over the niountuins,
., in..-1 thrtVult feai.
If th.' drive ,-ontinues and there is
no indicstion vet that the Rumanians
ha^e in >-?' ? ? I ' power to stem
it the Kumanian position in the I re
deal Pass would be flanke.l
Then would follow the fall of Ploesci
nnd with il the railway that supplies

made in front of the Arge.-iu River if
these important posttions are to be

Korlress Retdy for lest
Although the Rumanian capital has
been shifted to Jassy, Bucharest ,* still
the headquartcra of the Rumanian
army. But there il nothing to .-how
whether a stand will be made there
or the tiermans allo#ed to enter with?
out opposition.
The defences of Bucharest, with its
belt of forts, were completed only a
few weeks ago. and are equipped with
every devicc of modern armament and
well supplied for a long defence.

Lord of the Admiralty, admitted in an
nouncing the changes to the House of
' Commons to-day.
Public Expects Action
The man in the street is convinced
that the ahift in the higher commands
means that the navy will now be chiefly
a weapon of offence. The public ex
. pects great feats of daring and a policy
of destroying supersubmar.nes in their
; nests, while the blockade is kept suf
ficiently atrong to prevent any article
reaching Germany.
Naval men have no such sensational
expectations. They rely on the changes
to bring about smoother and more ef
fective working between the fleet and
the administrativf oftices at Whitehall.
hecause two men accustomed to actual
war conditions will now be cooperating.
They alao expect a firmer grip over
the blockade and more active measures
in fighting the submarine menace.

will assume control of all the coal
minea in South Wales. A committee
has bean appointed. representing the
Board of Trade, the Home Offlce and
the Admiralty, for the adminiatration
of the mines, and will mcet to-raorrow
to consider the queation of wages.
The action of the government in
taking control of the mines It an en
' tirely ncw departure and was caused by
the imperative necessity of preventing
a trade dispute from interfer-.ng with
the coal supply. Earlier in the course
of the war the government had taken
?Ueps to control the price, but from the
beginning of the war there haa been
trouble, arising from tne conatant con
? flict between miners and the owners on
. the question of wages._
OSBORNE APPEALS
TO GOV. WHITMAN
TO SAVE STIELOW
Urges Executive to Ignore Rules

demned Man
| Br TVlefrspfc ?? T** Trtbun* 1
Albany, Nov. 29. Another plea for
the life of Charles F. Stielow, con
demned '-o die at Sing Sing in the week
of December 11 for the murder of
Charles A. Phelps and his housekeeper,
was made to Govemor Whitman to-day
bv a delegation headed by James W.
Osborne. ex-Assist*nt Distnct Attorney
of New York County.
Mr. Oaborne admitted that in the
conviction every requirement of the
law had been met. but he declared that
there still was some doubt of Stielow's
guilt He asked that the Governor ig?
nore the rules of law and consider only
the question of equity, which, he de?
clared, was the real reason for giving
the pardoning power to the chitf execu
!ive.
"1 am not fighting the courts in thia
ca?t.M Mr. Osborre said. "Everything
ha?- been utrictly legai. but you have a
highei function. It la your pnvilege
an i funcr.on to look beyond the law at
cquitv."
Mr. ()?borne declared that five stnk
iet? pointed to Stielow's innocence.
(?Ithough not affecting the legahty of
the conviction: On the night of the
tragedy Stielow tned to aave the life
of one who would necessarily be a
witness againat him; he worked at hia
' usual chores for a month after the
crime; h? had no money after the
eriroa. thus dtsproving that he killed
Phelps with robberv as the motive; he
handled the bloodhounds that were
put on the trail of the murderer; and
he had always borne an excellent repu
tatior.
WOMAN BIOCS "L" TRAITIC
Body Wedged in Car'a Tnirk Tiea lp
Weat Side Tralna Two Houra
As a northbound train drew into the
: elevated sUtion at Ninety-ninth Street
? and Columbus Avenue laat night
Charles Marsh, the motorman, caught a
glimpse of a woman kneehng on the
thiid rail guard directly in front of
! him. Before he could apply the brakes
1 the forward car had struck her and she
had been caught in the wheela of ita
' front truck.
For nearly two houra the line waa
tlocked while a vrecking crew endeav
, ored to release the body. David Ham
mersley, station agent at Ninety-nintr.
Street, remembered aeeiug the woman,
but insiited that she had gone up the
staircaae to the southbound platform.
1 Apparently she had climbed down to
i the rails and walked acros* to meet the
i incoming train. Shi was ?lad in biack
I and wore a hat trimmed with white
feathert and red roaes.
They point to the fact that the huge
auxiliary services, such as patrols,
mine sweepers and convoys, grew up
under Jellicoe's supervision. and that
consequently he is certuin to use his
present executive posit.on to handle
them to the utmost advantage.
Bealty a National Hero
Reatty's elevation meets with com
plete approval. He has won morepres
;.ge during the war than any other m.in
in the mr. y. He has b?come a nationai
? hero, his photograph being displayed
e.erywhere, wh'le his skill, bulldog
pluck and audacity are the talk of all
men. He is now forty-flve, the
youngest adrairal in the navy.
His appointment is the gorernment's
answer to critics, who asserted that he
drove his battla cruiser squadron too
rashly into tha Jutland battle. Tha
govemment, target for all critics, Is
applauded to-day for its resolution in
disregarding all questions of seniority
and precedent to give the command to
the nation's choice.
( hange Long Expected
The changes were not unexpeeted.
For a long while it had been realiied
that the time had come when it was
necessary to hand over control of the
Admiralty to a gailor familiar with the
new conditions of warfare. It Is under
stood that Admiral Jackson himself
realized this as strongly as anybody
and was perfectly willing to place him?
self in that position where his ihihties
would best s*rve the nation.

Joint Note to Allies Insists
He Has Right to
Come
Washington. Nov. 29. The l'nited
States has sent notes to Great Britain
and Franee. it became known to-day,
requesting reconsideration of their r?
fusal to issue a safe conduct for Count
Tarnowski, the new Austro Hungarian
Ambassador.
The notes speak of the unfortunate
i effect that a continued refusal would
i have on opinion here. They point out
that it is an inalienable right of sover
eign nations to exehange ambassadors
and insist that a third nation, even in
time of war, is not justified in denying
that right.
Great care is taken to base the rep
resentations solely on the grounds of
international right, as distinguished
from courtesy, making it clear that
the l'nited States is not asking a favor
or assuming the atttude of a pieader.
Care also is taken not to put the
government in the position of having
changed its attitude since the last
communication on the subject, which
wai merely the transmission of the
Austrian government's requests for a
safe conduct. If the present notes
meet with an unsatisfactory response
it is admitted that a difticult situation
: will be dcveloped.
The Allied embassies are deeply con
cerned over the resentment felt by the
Washington Government and are tak
ing unusual care to keep their govern
ments fully informed. It is not known
that they have forwarded any direct
repfesentations to their governments,
except as the nature of their informa
tion is in itself a recommendation.
Nevertheless offloals have every hope
that this will go far toward influeneing
a change of attitude.
Karly repliet are expected, as Count
Tarnowski plans to saii from Rotter
dam on the Dutch steamer Nieuw An
sterdam on December 14.
Shouid the replies prove unfavorable
the L'nited States might send a mes
sage notifying the Allies that they
would disturb the Austrian envoy at
their own risk. or it might send an
American rnerchantman or warship to
some neutral port to receive the Am?
bassador. As yet, however, sueh a con
tingency has hardly been contemplated
, in view of the eonrident belief that the
Allies will vield.

By ARTHI'R S. DRAPER
London. Nov. 29.?The moat raent
peace discusaion m the United SUtea
receives a lot of atter.tion in London
and official circlea appreciate it* im
portance fully. In answer it can be
said that the war will be carried on
by the Allies with greater vigor than
ever.
The speech of Jacob H. Schiff, ad
vocating a move for mediation by the
United SUtes, gets a good deal of
space in the newspapera, and ita aig
nificance is rerognired. But tha
whole movement is generally re
garded as fostered by Gerrhan in
teiests and professional parifiata.
Seee Inirtgue In America
The British attitude mu broutjiit
out clearly in the House of Commona
to-day. Ronald McNeill, a Unioniat,
urged the government to make a
statement that there could be no dia
cussion of even a temporary atop in
military operationa until the Ger
mans had evacuated all Allicd terri?
tory.
McNeill argued that this would put
an end to "intrigue ln America or else
where. intended to bring peace befure
the Alhes had attained all their de
clared objecta."
"To make sueh a declaration might
be taken as meanlng that evacuation
of Allied teititory la all we are asking
for," r*plied A. Bonar Law, Secretary
for the Colonies, tpeaking for Premier
Asquith, who Sa conflned to hia bome
with a cold.
Britaln Stande by Allies
Mr. Law added that the queation waa
one for the Alliea to consider in co?
cert, and that until they had dis
cussed it he could say nothing except
that "the Alliea whose territory ii oe
cupied by the enemy roay be assured
of full aupport of the British govern?
ment."
The British Foreign Offlce discredit*
an editorial in "The Morning Post"
which rays: "The Germana have offered
us pea*-- pon the moat favorable terms,
the German conditlona being that Ger?
many be allowed a free hand in Cen
tral and South Arr.< rica."
No offer of thia kind haa been made
by Germany, the Foreign Office de
clarea, and it has no knowledge of
where the journal got this "informa
tion."
The editorial bas attracted consid
erable adverse comment from various
: aources. Although laughed at in most
quartera, it is embarrasing to the gov
ernment, which ia anxioua that no falie
impreasions regarding ita attitude tow
ard peace should get to America.
