WEEKLY CHRONICLE
FROM LAKE CITY.
STORE ROBBED?NEW CHURCH
TO BE BUH.T-LARGE SALE OF
LIVE STOCK-POLITICAL.
j-ake City, November 23:?The
Blizzard Hardware store was entered
by burglars one night last week,
and a few goods stolen. We understand
several pocket knives were
taken, and that these were about all
that could positively be said to be
missincr. This seems to point to a boy
or boys as the guilty. Entry was
effected through one of the rear
windows by removing a pane of
glass.
There will be a sale of cattle and
hogs here on December 7, the first
of its kind ever held at this town.
All the farmers of the county who
have any cattle or hogs to sell, are
invited to have them at Lake City
on that day. Mr J M Truluck is
working up this sale for the benefit
of the farmers. He tells the writer
that he is already assured of two
hundred and fifty cows and four
hundred hogs; and that there will be
ten to twelve buyers here, who are
coming from Richmond, Baltimore
and other packing-house cities
1 There will be no commissions. The
B object of this sale is to encourage
^ the raising of cattle and hogs, and
to give the farmers an opportunity
of learning: the proper condition
stock ought to be in when marketed.
Another idea is to establish a permanent
market where farmers and
f . stock raisers can take their cattle
and hogs every fall or winter and
turn them into money as readily as
. ' cotton.
The boll wt?evil is coming, and it
is certain that the demand for meats
will not grow less. Therefore, it
would seem to be the wise thing for
# the farmers of this country to increase
the raising of stock, wheat
and rice, especially. And these have
passed the experimental state in
this section. The biggest crop ol
rice made in thirty or forty years in
this community was gathered this
year, and the people are rejoicing
over their wisdom in sowing heavily
last spring. Those who raised wheat
are congratulating themselves; and
much more of this grain is now be
ing planted tnan ever before. .Nowhere
will you find a man with an
extra cow or hog who regrets the
fact. Our people must quit living
out of paper bags and tin cans, or
the process of growing poorer and
living harder must inevitably go on
and on.
Has any one stopped to think ol
the fact that the hosiery bills of today
are almost rivaling the clothing
bills in the matter of total cost?

The sturdy 15 cents hose and hall
hose are going?in fact, are well
nigh obsolete, while the 75 cents
lisle and $1.00 to $1.50 silk ones are
regarded as the onlv things "possible."
The 15 cents goods will outwear
the other, three to one, but
they are plain black or tan, and
worst of all they cost only ?iften
cents, while the others are heliotrope
or lavendar or clock-work, and cost
$1.00 to $1.50, and are so flimsy
that care must be employed to ever
get them on. And the total spent
for this stuff is surprising. If sorm
"fashionable" young man or womar

goods and compare with the year's
bills for clothing, thev will perhens
be astonished.

I WOMAN'S STORY FALSE.
1 Chester. November 28:?A growing
belief here is that, realizing thai
, the truth could no longer be con
| cealed, a certain married man anc
. a younc woman in this communitj
, recently conspired against a white
( man named Mobley, to the effeel
, that only by the careful and pains
. taking inquiry instituted by Solid
i tor James K Henry was the inno
cence of the accused man establish'
rd, and a lynching averted.
The story is strange, but true, anc
it is said that the relatives of the
young woman acted throughout ir
good faith on the strength of hei
I story.
About two weeks ago Sheriff Col
t vin was informed that a young worn
an had been assaulted by a white
. man, and that neighbors were pre
. paring to lynch the allege^ perpe
, trator of the crime.
Sheriff Colvin conferred with So
( licitor Henry, who at once realizec
the seriousness of the situation. The
Sheriff was directed to arrest the
( man and remove him to the Yori
I county jail. This was done, lessen
ing the danger of mob violence.
| The uncle of the young womar
I stated to Solicitor Henry that upor
a certain uuie 111 oepueumtri, a
| about dusk, while returning hom<
| through a dark place in the woods
his niece had been stopped by a man
taken from her buggy, and assault
ed. The man's description, giver
by the young woman, fitted th<
. prisoner in every detail, even to t
. scar on his face.
I The young woman stated to hei
uncle that she had been too fright
ened to make an outcry, and hac
kept silent since on the threat o:
' the man to kill her if she told. Up
I on being confronted witn tne prison
er in the York county jail, the younf
( woman positively identified him a:
I her assailant.
Solicitor Henry began a carefu
investigation of the affair, He sta
ted to the young woman's uncli
^ that he would call a special term o
court for an immediate trial, bu
would be forced to give the accuse<
) man the benefit of all the inve3ti
gation that could be made.
The Solicitor's inquiry developer
startling facts. The testimony o
several physicians was heard. Thi
I mother and father and the uncli
I who had preferred the charges be
1 came convinced that they had beei
' deceived, and the accused man wa
released.
There seems to have been no ques
i tion of the honesty and sincerity o
the girl's uncle throughout thi
whole proceedings. The father anc
mother were also under the impress
ion that their daughter's story wa:
true. Upon realizing that they hac
been deceived, they requested th<
release of the imprisoned man.

A FINANCIAL DISAPPOINTMENT

-'! The last programme of the Radcliffe
Chautauqua entertainments
"; was concluded at the school audi- j
J torium Friday night in the presence
*; of the largest audience that had
' greeted the performers during the
' series of attractions which opened
;!on the previous Wednesday afterk;
noon. The programme for the last
" j day was perhaps the most enjoyable
of the six features, especially so by
1 those who appreciate high class
1 music, such as was rendered by the i
t Ernest Gamble Concert Party Fri- i
j day afternoon and night. Mr Gam- j
" ' J -- -- I
; Die can wen De ciasseu as au aruat. i
'; His voice is a deep baritone and he j
" | sings with great ease and wonder- j
1! ful expression.
21 Miss Verna L Page, violinist, was
by far the best lady performer ever;
heard here, and it was plainly evir
dent that she was a favorite among
her auditors. The work of Miss
* Aline Kuhn on the piano was excel^
lent and* much appreciated by the
audience.
The lectures by Dr Adams,both in
?! the afternoon and at night, can well
5; be classed among the best ever heard
! here. Several who heard him re'!
marked to us that either one of his
": lectures was worth double the j
?} price of the season ticket. Dr Ad^,
ams is a high toned Christain gentle11
man and we don't believe he knows
j i
what a grouch is as applicable to
his own nature and disposition. He
! soon saw the situation the guaran^;
tors were in and did everything in
f
his power to make matters as easy
a 1
" for them as possible.
From a financial standpoint the
success of the Chautauqua was a
1 failure, more so than last year, but
those who had signed for the return
1 of these entertainers came up and
paid the deficit like men, and many
f ?
; of them became guarantors for next

IN THE TOILS OF THE LAW. j 11
? N
Two Young Negroes Find that
the Way of the Sinner Is Hard. 1
Two vounsr negro men, Thaddeus
and Walter Fulton by name, are in, _
thp toils of the law because of hav-! u'
ing been caught at their nefarious1
work.
Thaddeus was a trusted emploje
at the Kingstree Garage, where, it
seems, he actually had almost daily jn
access to the cash register in Man
ager Thompson's office, for money i ac
was missed from this great mechan- j tr
ical device time and time again. I m
Once, we are told, Thaddeus wss.'q
caught with eleven perfectly good ^
simoleons in his possession, of which .
he had relieved this great Dayton in
(0) device. But Thaddeus was still fir
retained as an employe and manag- w;
ed to appropriate to his own keeping
numerous articles of value in the gt
way of auto accessories, and very
probably would soon have owned an pr
auto had he not become dissatisfied de
with what he could steal from the th
garage during the week and entered ca
the place Sunday night,burglar fash- ^
ion,carrying off nearly everything in
sight.
Thaddeus took a partner along
with him Sunday night in the ebony
personage of Walter Fulton, who
now languishes in the county jail
with Thaddeus, both awaiting trial ,
at the court of general sessions, a
preliminary hearing having been ?^1
held Monday by Magistrate Gamble, ac
who turned them over to the tender 12
mercies of Jailor Cockfield. sj(
Mr Montgomery Caned. ^
cr
Several weeks ago Mr H E Mont- pj
gomery tendered his resignation as
co
superintendent of the Sunday-school
of the Presbyterian church here ana
on last Sunday he was presented by m
the school with a gold headed walk- te
ing cane. Mr Montgomery has held
the office of superintendent of the
school for a number of years. Mr J gt
D O'Bryan, a popular young attor- ^
ney, has been appointed to succeed
Mr Montgomery. pi
