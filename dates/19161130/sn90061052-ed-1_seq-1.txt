TUBERCULOSIS CONTROL
The Schools and Newspapers
WorkMTogLether to that End
Dr W McN Miller Secretary of the
Missouri Association for the Relief and
Control of Tojoerculosis at the State
Teachers Association meeting at St
Louis last week made the statement
that the schools and the editors of
Missouri were showing the world the
way to eradicate tuberculosis Thcv
are making Missouri the show you
state he said
In 1015 there were 03 fewer deaths
from tuberculosis in the State than in
111 This is a diminution ir the
deatli rate from tuberculosis in Mis
souri of two and njinlf per cent n yeai
The saving to the stale in 1113 in dol
lars and cenU was nearly four million
dollars and in the four years over nine
millions Dr Miller attributes this
saving of lives and wealth to the
spreading of information pertaining to
tuberculosis by the schools and news
papers of the State in connection witli
the annual sale of Red Cross Christmas
seals
The growth of interest in the fight
in the state he said is tremendous
In the per capita population sale of
seals in 1011 Missouri ranked twentieth
in the roll of the states 1013 she took
the rank of ten in 1010 he said she
will give Rhode Island Connecticut
and New York State the leaders in
1015 a hard run for first honor
The Red Cross seals and printed
matter luwe been sent to Superintend
ent F C Wilkinsof the Jasper Schools
and County Superintendent Kost has
been advised that plenty of seals and
printed matter can be had for the
rural schools in Jasper County
The seal for this year comes in green
und red anil is very ornamental and full
of Christmas cheer The printed mat
ter to be supplied toschool children and
for their distribution is more attractive
than ever Seals will be sold by mail
as well us by school children but the
schools will be given full credit for the
sale by mail People buying seals by
mail will notify the teachers or super
intendent by a coupon to be sent by a
school child or by mail
A report of last years sale of seals
and the announcement of nwards of
pennants and honors made to schools
will be published next week

Joplins Mayor Rules Against
Booze
Hon Hugh Mclndoe mayor of Jop
lln the largest city in Jasper County
and one of the most booc ridden cities
in the slate of Missouri issued an order
last week providing that no fireman or
policeman of that cily shall drink in
toxicating liquor nt any time or place
while in the employ of the city The
order goes further and carries with it
the provision that dramshop keepers
shall report to htm any huch officer or
fireman who takes a drink Thcpcnal
ty falling upon such saloon keeper for
failure to carry out his part of the or
der is the loss of his saloon license
Police and fire departments regula
tions heretofore provided that members
of these department should not enter
n salocn except in line of duty and
should not take a drink while in uni
form
Mayor Mclndoe inan interview with
a newspaper man said
The rule has come from n feeling
that liquor lowers the efllclency of the
departments and robs the men as
much as the city Booe and city
business have nothing in common and
1 believe the best way tn increase the
efllciency of the departments is to bar
liquor
1 have in mind a time when the
public when it sees an ofllcer can
say There goes a man who never
drinks
Latkh The loplin City Commis
sion met Tuesday and extended the
above order to all city employes lop
lin thus takes a forward move in city
government that will be approved by
the people the State over
Five firemen resigned Tuesday on
account of the order and their resigna
tions promptly accepted and their
places filled at once from the waiting
list
