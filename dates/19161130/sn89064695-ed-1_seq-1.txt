Second class.
Chester A. Gongdon,
"Chester A. Oongdon of Duluth,
Minn., Republican National Com
mitteeman from Minnesota, law
yer of more than national reputa
tion, and mineral king, died at St.
Paul on the 21st. inst."
In these words one of the Twin
City papers announced the death
of Mr. Congdon.
While Mr. Congdon was a man
of great historic fame in Minneso
ta, and of national, by reason of
his political, legal and financial
standing, we desire here to pay
tribute more to the man who has
''Gone to that bourne from which
no man returneth," within the
realm of what may broadly be
termed the spiritual bide of his
nature.
We approach, too, the narrative
greatly with a keen sense of the
personal element, for in the death
of Mr. Congdon we have lost a
friend of intimate and many years
staning. aga.inU?rewwJes
Rochester "8. Y. .Kine 12th,
1853. His father was a Methodist
minister of English Quaker ante
cedents.
Chester A. Congdon studied in
the common schools of Elmira,
N. Y., attended the East Genesse
Conference at Ovid, N. Y. and in
875 graduated from Syracuse
University. He was admitted to
the bar of New York in 1877, and
three years later came to Minneso
ta and began the practice of law in
St. Paul.
Being a stranger, naturally he did
not get a large clientele, he spent
much time in the United States
court room at St. Paul taking a
deep interest in the important
cases which were being tried there.
Jt was here that he attracted the
attention of Mr. W. W. Billson,
then the United States district
attorney. Very soon the latter
procured the assistance of Mr.
Congdon in the preparation of a
very important case, and this he
did so well that he was subsequent
ly frequently asked by Mr. Billson otherwise it is not. From
to be associated with him in im
portant cases
in .the position of assistant United
States attorney, Mr. Congdon wa*s
appointed to the position upon
Mr. B'Wson's recommendation not
withstanding the strong political
endorsements of several other ap
plicants for the position.
Mr. Billson, according to the
statement of friend-?, always felt
great satisfaction over his choice
of Mr. Cjngdon to bs his assist
ant.
Mr. Billson came into offic* un
der a republican regime, and when
a change occured in party admin
istration his office was affected
clined the offer of nomination.
In 1892 he removed to Duluth,
and a law partnership was formed
with his former chief, Mr. Billson.
In time both of these gentlemen
retired from legal practice, and
chiefly mining, turned his atten
tii to their management. He
had become largely interested in
Minnesota iron mines, served the
mining companies in a legal capa
city and also in executive.
We have stated in the above
lines, briefly, the educational,
legal, financial and official experi
ences of Mr. Congdon, but desire
co state right here his moral views
as connected with his official
career.
While assistant United States
district attorney, he did all within
his power to suppress the sale of
liquor to Indians, as much because
of his strong abhorrence of liquor,
as to fulfill his legal duties in this
respect.
He was the first person to bring
into notice the nearly forgotten
treaty stipulations of 1855 be
tween the United States and the
Cliippewas of Minnesota, which
prohibits the introduction of in
toxicants into a large portion of
the northern part of this state,
but at this time Mr* Billson's
friends were suggesting nim as a
candidate for Congress, action up
on the treaty stipulation was not
pressed, and much to the disap
pointment of Mr. Congdon. His

Later, when a vacancy occured men's motives, and to treat them

lie was a man of retiring dis
position, a tr.tit that after all fre
quently goes with men grown
great in public affairs.
But with all this retiring dis
position, he attracted many men,
therefore he had many close
r'.ends, and thehe were men who

ests, is evidence of his string op
position to liquor traffic.
Mr. Congdon became acquainted
with many Chippewa Indians dur
ing his incumbency as assistant
United States attorney and thus
learned much of the Indian's idio
syncrasy, his weakness and help
lessness. His large 4*eart opened,
and in the prosecution of cases
against them he tempered justice
by that "quality of mercy which
is not strained," therefore he was
lenient and forbore the prosecution
of an Indian whose violaticn of
law w#.s simply technical, and thus
in his large hearted charity he
won many friends among the In
dians. But in saying this it must
al-o be mentioned that his sense of
justice was so strong that he prose
cuted vigorously the white saloon
keepers and bootleggers who sold
liquor to the red man.
Mr. Congdon has been spoken
of as a man of distance, cold and
unaporoachable. If this means
that he did not "wear his hearj.
upon his sleeve," it may be true,
our
knowledge of him we know that it

he giveth his life for a friend."
Mr. Congdon was capable of do
ing this both physically and men
tally.
If bearing friends in mind, and
feeling strong interest in their
welfare, means "giving life for a
friend," then Mr. Congdon "died
daily."
He gave business advice freely,
spoke often encouraging words to
weary hearted friends, he gave
liberally of his means to assist
when business troubles oppressed.
His charities extended also to
worthy poor in worldly goods,
and to public charitable enter
prises and community interests,
but of these he said nothing him
self nor permitted revelations.
And yet much is known because
gratitude would not keep silent,
and pride in a great citizen forced
soiie expressions.
We write knowingly and feel
ingly because we knew the man
welt.
We came constantly into con
stantly with Mr. Congdon for
thirteen years, while we both
wore in the government service.
Our respective duties threw us
into constant travelling associa
tions, and thus we learned to ap
preciate him as only such a man
as he was can be appreciated.
No one knew better than we
knew him for the high grade and
rightious man he was, and we have
profitted much in- our own past
experience in life by his advice
respecting contact with mankind

criticise them,
but no man of those whom he took
into confidence ever heard him
utter an unkind word toward*
anyone.
And now the great brain and
the kind heart are stilled he will
no more be seen in this earth's
scenes guiding business affairs and
relieving distresses.
Memorials of public character
will be erected "in memoriam,"
but he will but live in the hearts
of those who loved him, his name
aria1
record being "writ" indelibly
upon the tablets of memory.
Mr. Congdon has left a wife and
six children in sorrow and bereve
ment. These children have all in
herited the leading characteristics
of their fatl#r they have good,
hard sense, and although they
have been surrounded by wealth,
and all the ease and comfort it
brings, their plain and unassuming
manner of living is evidence that
none of them have allowed them
selves to live a life of idleness and
uselessness.
Edward C. Congdon, who has
apparently inherited all the re
markably traits of his father,
even that of the retiring dis
position, is fairly well known
here, and those who had oc
casion to accompany him on a
trip throughout the reservation
irequentb refer to his plain and
democratic ways.
The editor of THE TOMAHAWK
joins with the many friends of the
late Mr. Congdon in words of
sympathy to the bereaved family,
but with the great addition of
personal touch under memories of
the past and sorrows of the
present. SEGREGATION OF TRIBAL
FUNDS,
During the present federal ad
ministration the segregation of
Chippewa tribal funds should be
discussed and if possible accora
pli^hed.
With* the proper man at the
helm in the Indian office at Wash
ington, one who may be friendly
to segregation, the tribal funds
now in the Treasury may be di
vided per capita and placed to the
credit of each person entitled
thereto.
Without the approval of the In
dian office it would be a most diffi
cult matter to have the tribal funds
of the Chippewas of Minnesota
segregated, and while there are
reasons that it would be to the ad
vantage of theChippewas of Min
nesota to leave their tribal funds
in the Treasury of. the United
States intact, the large amounts
that are being wasted now make it
necessary for a division of the
fund, to save it for the Indians.
Republican Progressive
May Become Cabinet
Officer.
According to the Washington
Star, President Wilson may decide
to appoint a Progressive Republi
can to a position in his cabinet.
If the president should decide to
do this, next to California a Min
nesota progressive should be con
sidered.
Minnesota has one very promin
ent urogressive in the person of
Senator Moses E. Clapp, who was
favorable to President Wilson live
years ago and before the latter
was nominated as a candidate at
Ba&i&ore by the democrats. rf
^In discussing political conditions
with Senator Clapp in 1911, sever
al reservation democrats who were

in Washington then were told by
the senator that Governor Wilson
was the best man the democrats
could put up that he was clean
cut and would make a good presi
dent. There seemed to be no po
litical significance in this state
ment by Senator Clapp, and he no
doubt made the statement from
his personal admiration of the
president. But with this feeling
towards the president, Senator
Clapp could consistantly fill any
position under the Wilson admin
istration, and if it is the intention
of President Wilson to appoint a
progressive as one of his cabinet
officers, and Minnesota should be
taken into consideration, Senator
Clapp's appointment would no
doubt please the progressives of
not only Minnesota but of the
northwest generally.
Will There Be A. Newcountrmoney
The question whic'h may now be
perplexing the Indians of this
country is whether a new Commis
sioner of Indian Affairs will be
appointed by President Wilson
Among congressmen there is con
siderable opposition to Commis
sioner Sells*, because the changes
which were expected would take
place during the present adminis
tration did not take place in the
Indian service, and especially in
the field service among the In
dians

out the country may endeavor to
secure the appointment of a suc
cessor to Commissioner Sells, the

Calamity Howlers Cannot
Bring Hard Times,
Strongly prejudiced parti/.ens
cannot bring hard times to this
country by dwelling upon one sub
ject, and this is that on account of
President Wilson's re-eleetion
there will be hard times and this
will be felt as soon as the Euro
pean war closes.
Never in the history of this
country has there ever been so
much per capita in the
as there is today, and
never has the Treasury of the
United States had so much gold in
its vaults as it now has. Even if
Europe should cease its war it
would be several years before its
demands upon the United States
would cease.
If the large nations of Europe
would cease lighting now it would
be of greater benefit to the United
States than if they would cease
fighting only after they have be
come bankrupt.
If hard times come it will not bo
under the present federal adminis
tration and perhaps not even dur
ing the next administration. But
administrations will have no effect
upon the conditions of" the times,
and no one need to worry about
this.
