uild Roads with
"Staying Qualities'
With the recently awakened
Interest in the cause of good
loads the. question of financing
jtoad building is of first impor
jtance. How road building can
Ibe paid for is mt the only seri
ous. question, however, but which
Ipne of several possible methods
f construction will best suit the
eeds of the community and give
he people the best roads at as
mall cost as possible within the
imit of available funds.
The first cost may be "only a
small part of the total. Roads
must be maintained in good con
dition, and the cheapest road is
the one that costs-least per year
to build and keep in shape for
travel. This. is the recent state
ment of R. W. Gay. of the Mis
sissippi A. and M. College. Con
tinuing, Mr. Gay says that in
New York state it .was found
helper to exnend .25,000 a mile
the conftructiori of brick hi;;h
ys than to pay from $7,000 to
0,000 a mile tor macadam be-
ause of the difference in cost of
upkeep.
To save maintainance expense
the idea of present economy
must not be allowed to overshad
ow the importance of building
permanent highways. 'While it
is not possible here to consider
relative annual costs of the va-
ous classes of roads for Missis-
ppi as a rule the roads which
iost the most at first will be the
cheapest to maintain.
- Special information on the cost
and durability of several classes
of road material will be sent to

Clean up the Orchard
A little labor expended in a
thorough cleaning of the orchard
in the fall after the leaves have
fallen and the farm work has
become slack, will be unusually
profitable. This clearing con
sists of the removal and burning
of all weeds, brush, dead limbs
and leaves.
By this simple process thous
ands and some cases even mil
lions of insect eggs and fungous
spores that have been produced
during the past season will be
Hpstroved. In no line of work is
a little prevention more superior
to remedy than it is here. Each
one of these eggs or spores is
onl waiting for a favorable op
portunity to hatch or grow, and
start its work upon the fruit
crop of next season.
The cost of this prevention is
small when compared to the
Vht snravinc which will not

insects.or iungus growins win
cost more than this cleaning.
Even these will not be destroyed
until they have done at least a
little damage. . Some raise the
objection that the removal of
weeds and - leaves deprives the
of a large amount of fertilizer
and humus. This undoubtedly
is true but there is little doubt
that one can apply as much fer
tilizer as is removed in the weeds
and leaves at a cost 'much less
than the value of the fruit dam
agel by. insects and fungus dis
eases. L.G. Herron Extension

Order Nursery Stock Now
Early ordering of nursery stock
is advantageous to both the
purchaser and nurseryman. The
varieties and locations of the
plantings of trees and bush fruits
and grapes can well be selected
now. This gives the purchaser
a chance to receive bids on the
nursery stick at the cheapest
prices. Frequently a very fav
orable time for planting presents
itself early in the winter and
unless the stock was ordered and
secured in the early winter this
chance must pass by unheeded.
By ordering early the nursery-
i man is able to give oeuer ser
vice. He has more stock to pick
from and as a result the purchas
er gets a better quality of stock.
The nurseryman can also furnish
a greater number of varieties.)
and has a chance to select a more I
favorable time for shipping, lie
U not rushed and takes more
care in the labelling and packing
of the stock. -L. G. Herron,

Hewers of Stone ar.d
Drawers of Water
Mississippi possesses natural
advantages second to no state in
the Union. Our people are hon
est, hard-working, God-fearing,
law-abiding and congenial to the
limit. But with all this, there
has been lacking to a considera
ble degree an element that is ab
solutely necessary to the success
' .
that is due them. That
is the
snirit of asrorressiveness and
a
determination to bring about the
proper development of our great
resources and create a demand
for the excellent products of our
farms.
This criticism is made in the
kindest spirit by one who has la
bored with the masses for many
years and has for them a great
bond of sympathy and the high
est respect. . There are many
who are wide-awake and striving
for better things, but the percen
tage is by far too small. The
people are still "hewers of stone
and drawers of water" for a
more progressive and aggressive
citizenship of other states.
The products of other fields
have been exploited in our State
and are in common use to the ex
clusion of our ownlthat are equal
ly as good, and in many instan
ces, better. This condition has
caused hard times and dissatis
faction with thousands who like
ly do not appreciate the cause
yet these same citizens are more
likely the ones that would oppose
a suggestion that would help in
every way.
This was the case when the
Centennial Exposition was pro
posed and the campaign for its
existance was being waged, al
though the experience of other
states was at hand to prove that
it has been the best investment
ever made. Members of the
Legislature from counties that
were sorely in need of just such
help as the Exposition could lend
were the strongest contenders
against it. as were undoubtedly
the people of the counties that
they'represented.
More than a million visitors
will be attracted to Mississippi by
the exposition, and our sweet po
tatoes, rice, syrup, oranges and
other products can be made so
popular and such a demand crea
ted that there will be no lack of
a staple market for all that we
can grow, but there are so many
who do not believe in these things
ana go ngnt aiong ana Duy less

meritorious articles of the same
kind from other sections that
are alive and pushing.
There is enough burning truth
in these statements to cause ev
ery good citizen of the State to
sit up and take notice; to inves
tigate for himself and deter
mine "where we are at" and be
gin an active campaign to cor
rect the errors under which we
exist and the causes for our
present condition. ,
Just so long as we reck along
we will stil be "hewers of stone

Shelter and Paint Saves
Buying a New Plow
'A nickel saved is a nickel
made." Many nickels and dol-
lars too can be saved in shop bills
and the cost of new
chinery by hauling
harrows, hay rakes
farm ma-
plows,
and
other
implements right now
and stor-
ing them under shelter. Still
mere nickels can be saved if the
odd times and rainy days during
the-winter are used to overhaul
and repaint these machines.
J. II. Ricks, of the A. and M.
College Experiment Station, says
that the present cost of machin
ery makes it more than ever nec
essary that every tool be made
to do its maximum amount of
service. Thousands of dollars
that go North each spring for
farm machinery can be kept
at home if Southern farmers will
build'implement sheds instead of
makine-use of convenient trees
, . ... ,
or leaving ineir iouis uj warp,
crack, and rust out in 'jthe fields.
Paint, too, is a wonderful pre
server of wood, and on the metal
parts it prevents the formation
of a coat of rust which not only
looks bad, but eats away practi
cally as much of the metal as is
worn off by .a season of hard use.
Grease or oil will preserve the
mold boards and other bright
wearing parts where paint can
not be used.
Live Exposition Notes
Contracts were let the first of
this week for a number of the
largest buildings on the Exposi
tion grounds. In these were in
cluded the Coliseun and the Mis
sissippi building to be erected by
the State. She Coliseum will be
the largest and best assembly
hall in the South. The Missis
sippi building will be 100 x 300
feet and used for permanent ex
hibits from the various counties
of the State. The others are the
Manufacturers, Boys and Girls,
Womens, Efficiency and Applied
Arts. The longest time requir
ed for building. will be the Colis
eum which must be ready for use
by the first of July next year.
, To the comparitively new coun
ty of George is due the credit of
of sending the first warrant for
partisipation in the big birthday
party. The appropriation made
by the Board of Supervisors will
be supplemented by towns, cor
porations and individuals and an
excellent showing made. The
exhibit will be made in a hand
some glass case and good for
years. It will be available for
the expositions to be held annu
ally as for the thousands of nor
thern visitors who will visit the
coast each winter.

The Qualification of a Teacher
and the Ways of Conducting
Published by request
The work of the Sunday School
is the general work, committed
of God to His people, which work
is to win the lost to Jesus and to
develop the lives of those won in
helpfulness and holliness. The
teacher is the key to the success
of that work. His or her place
second only to the minister called
of God to publicly proclaim His
gospel. 1
The qualifications of a teacher
are matters of great importance.
First of all he needs a new heart,
he must have a personal ex
perience of grace, he must know
the way he is to lead others.
No intellectual preparation will
answer, if the heart preparation
is absent, in God's kingdom.
He must take heed unto himself
and doctrines, continue in them
for in so doing he'will save him
self and those that hear him.
There are some things a teach
er must know if he meets the
demands of his great work.
He must know the Lord, he must
know himself, he must know his
lesson, he must know his pupils.
He must have convictions heart
convictions about his work,
realize that he is dealing with
immortal souls and teaching the
eternal word of God. This will
lead to prayer, preparation,
punctuality, planning and perse
verance in the work.
The successful teacher must
have a great deal of patience,
never losing his temper or De
coming nervous at the restless
ness of his class. Always - look
pleasant even if you can't look
pretty.
Be cheerful at all times.
Cheerfulness is contagious. A
pleasant faced cheerful teacher
will radiate cheer and good will
among his entire class.
The way of conducting a class.
This will be determined by the
character o the pupils, as to
age, advancement and capacity
Some times the teacher must
lead the thought of the class
with the facts of the lesson firm
ly fixed in his own mind and
develop them for the benefit of
the class. Then again lead the
class out to express their
thoughts and impressions of the
truthes under consideration.
Use simple homely .illustrations
to develop the thoughts of the
text. He must know and im
press the main facts of the les
son, noting these facts: to whom
the scripture, was spoken, by
whom spoken, when spoken and
for what purpose spoken.
He must first secure the pu
pils attention (you cannot teach
without attention) making clear
that which you teach. Secure
your pupils help, fastening the
the truth taught, emphasize the
the spiritual teaching of the
scripture, having uppermost in
thought the salvation of the pu
pils and the development of the
saved. . Have faith in the pupils
and inspire their tfaith in you.
Vary your methods. Do not
allow your teaching to become
monotonous or run in grooves.
Use the blackboard all you can!
We remember things we see so
much better than what we hear.
"Telling is not teaching",
neither hearing a recitation or
"asking the questions" is teach
ing the two must be combined.
Have the lesson planned so
that you will yejt through in the
time alloted for recitation. Be
sure to use all the time but be
just as sure to get through.
Use at least the last five minutes
in firmly fixing the central truth
or spiritual teaching in the minds
and heart3 of the class so that it
will be remembered.,

Sheriff Magnum
Out With Facts
Declares He Feels it His Duty to
Say a Good Word For Medi
cine That Has Helped Him so
Much.
"Tanlac has certainly helped
me, and I recommend it to others
for what it has done in my
case," said Hon. C. W. Mangum,
of Atlanta, sheriff of Fulton
County. ' '
"I have personally recommend
ed it to a great many people. I
know of at least fifteen or twen
ty families who have bought it
on my cay so.
"I am 70 years old, and have
most always been pretty strong
and healthy until here lately I
have been in a nervous, worn-out
run-down condition. My stom
ach was upset most of the time,
and I digested my food poorly,
most always after eating I would
have a full, uncomfortable feel
ing'thut would last for several
hours.
"After taking the second bot
tle of Tanlac the fullness and all
the disagreeable symptoms dis
appeared, and my condition is
now that of a well man. I now
eat heartily without any bad
after effects, and I sleep well at
night.
"Tanlac seemed to be just
what I needed to put my system
in shape, and has toned me right
up. Under the circumstances, I
think it perfectly natural for me
to say a good word for it and
recommend it to my friends."
Among the large number of
prominent men in public life in
the South who have recently
given Tanlac their unqualified
endorsement for the specific aid
to them are Hon. McKenzie
