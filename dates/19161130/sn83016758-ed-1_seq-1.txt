SPUD MARKET DROPS
Potato Prices Drop Ten Cents on the
Local MarketReceipts Are
Now Some Lighter.
The Car Shortage Retards Shipments
Over 125,000 Bushels of
Spuds in Princeton.
The local potato market has been
some weaker the past week, and rather
quiet as a result. Receipts have not
been what might be termed heavy.
From $1.10 to $1.25 have been paid
for all varieties except Triumphs,
which are worth from $1.45 to $1.50.
Shipments are looking up some, and
10 carloads of tubers left the depot
today. There are still several thous
and bushels in the hands of buyers
here. It is estimated that over 125,-
000 bushels are stored in Princeton
warehouses.
The Chicago potato market is prac
tically unchanged in prices, but the
demand from the outside buying trade
has shown some improvement the past
week. Receipts have been lighter
than the week previous. Operators
are holding only a small per cent
of the stock they usually have at this
period.
A record sale of potatoes came to
light a few days ago when it was
learned that the Boyle Co., of Twin
Falls, Idaho, had sold a car of their
graded stock, known as "Boyle's Big
Bakers," at $3 per hundred pounds.
The deal was handled on a cash basis
and will likely stand as one of the
highest sales of the year.
The Eagle Lake, Texas, potato sec
tion was visited by the coldest norther
last week ever experienced in Novem
ber in years. Prominent potato men
say that the frost and freezing tem
perature were immaterial in damag
ing the crops. The recent drought
when the potatoes needed moisture
killed all chances of a yield of more
than 20 bushels to the acre, or per
haps less. It is said that in some
spots the potatoes would have done
fairly well, but taking the section as
a whole not more than three cars of
seed will be raised. All potato men
look for a big decrease in the acreage
-text spring. Seed potatoes are now
worth about $2 per bushel and are
scarce. Had a good rain visited the
section in September the farmers
would have raised enough seed for
planting the usual acreage.
The car shortage continues serious,
but some relief has been reported
from points that are located on two
or more competitive lines. Other less
fortunately located stations continue
to experience serious difficulty in get
ting anything like the needed number
of suitable cars.
Members of the American Railway
association met in Louisville last
week, and it is thought that a plan
lias been formulated for placing the
car shortage matter in the hands of
an executive board represented by
members of the Railway association,
and one or more members of the In
terstate Commerce Commission, this
committee to have full power to act
in the matter of prompt release of
cars for the benefit of such sections
of the country as are most affected
by the present shortage.
Lona Fendell Company to Show Here.
Miss Lona Fendel* and her company
of 10 people will appear at the Arm
ory, Saturday and Sunday, Dec. 9 and
10. This company is playing this
week at St. Cloud, and is coming here
highly recommended. Rev. Fr. B.
Habraken, pastor of St. Mary's church
of Cumberland, Wis., said: "The Lona
Fendell Stock Company have presented
during the last few months a series of
plays, and I cannot but give them
the best recommendation. They have
presented different plays that I have
seen myself, and I must say that the
company has met with the greatest
success. They are able to please a
high class audience and I cannot re
member anything that equals it, and
their sketches contain absolutely
nothing that will offend. Signed, Rev.
Fr. B. Habraken.
Acton Wedding and Silver Weddings.
The Peter Bisser home in the town
of Acton was the scene of a wedding
celebration and of two wedding anni
versaries Saturday afternoon last.
The pleasant affair Involved the bride
and the gropm and their parents.
Miss Louise Bisser became the bride
of Belvin H. Anderson. The bride is
the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Peter
Bisser of Acton and the groom the
son of Mr. and Mrs. Magnus Anderson
of Princeton, but former residents of
Meeker county. The ceremony was
performed in the presence of a gath
eri ng of relatives and friends by Rev.
Weeks of Grove City. Miss Nettie
Anderson attended the bride and Con
rad Bisser the groom. Mrs. Olof
Christianson played the wedding
march.
The bride wore a dress of crepe de
chine trimmed with beads, a veil, and
carried a boquet of white carnations.
The bridesmaid's gown was also of
crepe de chine, trimmed with beads
and she carried pink carnations.
The two couples who celebrated
their silver wedding anniversary the
same afternoon and in the presence
of the same company were Mr. and
Mrs. Peter Bisser and Mr. and Mrs.
Magnus Anderson. Both of the cou
ples were married in Meeker county
twenty-five years ago and at two
different weddings. Mr. and Mrs. An
derson later removed to Princeton,
where they have resided the past nine
teen years.
A dinner and reception followed
the celebrations.
Mr. and Mrs. Belvin H. Anderson,
groom and bride, will make their
home on the Bisser farm south of
Grove City.Grove City Times.
Blakkested Acquitted.
P. P. Blakkested of South Harbor was
acquitted of violating the state game
laws by a jury in Justice Dickey's
court last Thursday afternoon. Game
Warden F. M. O'Neill of Aitkin was
the complaining witness, and he
charged that the defendant had killed
a mallard duck from a motor boat.
Mr. Blakkested admitted that he had
killed a duck, but testified that he shot
it on Hennepin Island. County At
torney Myron appeared for the state,
and Attorney E. L. McMillan for the
defendant. The jury was out but a
few minutes.
The Justice was more than fair to
the prosecution. Mr. McMillan made
it decidedly interesting for O'Neil
and showed up his past record by doc
umentary evidence in the shape of
certificates from the clerk of court's
office in Aitkin county. The sooner
the game and fish commission get rid
of O'Neil the better it will be for the
A Success in One Respect.
In one respect at least the mobiliza
tion of our troops on the border has
been a great success. Its freedom
from disease forms a delightful con
trast to previous American experiences
at warfare. Our militia has been
quartered on the border now for four
monthsa period longer than the
Spanish-American war. It has lived
mostly in an unhealthy country, un
der climate conditions easily provoca
tive of epidemics. These are con
ditions which, in 1908, produced the
epidemics of typhoid, dysentery, and
other tropical diseases that caused
nearly all the mortality of the Span
ish war. But no such calamities have
disgraced this campaign. Major-Gen
eral Pershing's force and the militia
have won no brilliant military vic
ories, but they have vanquished the
enemies that have hitherto proved "the
most formidable in warfare.World's
Work.
Fred Did Not Ride.
Fred Murphy had the stage all set
for a free ride down Main street in
a 1917 model wheel barrow last Sat
urday afternoon, with Isaac Martin
furnishing the jnotive power. This
was to be in accordance with a bet on
the presidential election, made by
Messrs. Martin and Murphy, but noth
ing came of it, Mr. Martin, who is
73 years old, did not feel equal to the
task, and Fred Holm offered to be
his substitute. There was an ominous
glint in the eyes of Holmhe lost a
few nickels and dimes on Hughes,
toowhen he told Murphy of the
altered arrangements, but the latter
decided that the ground was even
harder than the head of a Wilson man
and concluded to pass up the ride.
Mr. Martin then /bought the smokes
for a few of the boys, and everybody
was satisfied.
Tenth. District Dramatic Contest.
The preliminaries of the 10th con
gressional district dramatic contest
will be held at Hinckley and Buffalo,
Friday, February 16th, 1917. Each
high school, including the local high
school is invited to send a boy and a
girl to one of these preliminaries.
Each boy should have an oration of
not more than eight minutes in length
and each girl should have a dramatic
selection of not more than ten min
utes in length.
The two winners of each division
in both the northern and southern sec
tions will then meet at a central place
to determine the champions of the
district. The state champion will be
determined at a final contest held in
Minneapolis^ during the "Superinten
dents' conference.

Final Services.
Funeral services for the late Gustaf
H. Flink, a member of Co. G, who
passed away at Brownsville, Texas,
last week were held at the Swedish
Baptist church at Milaca Monday af
ternoon, and that spacious edifice was
taxed to its capacity to accommodate
those who congregated there to pay
a final tribute of respect to the de
parted young man. Rev Dagner de
livered a fitting sermon, and beau
tiful vocal solos were rendered by Mrs.
Fox and Mr. H. A. Garrison. The
floral tributes were made up of lillies
of the valley and red roses, bound
together in red, white and blue, and
the casket was covered with them.
Interment was in Forest Hill ceme
tery, and deceased was laid at rest in
his soldier's uniform.
Among those from Princeton who
attended the obsequies were three
former Co. comradesW. C. Doane,
Claire Smith and L. F. Wilkesand
Mr. and Mrs. Harry Shockley, Mr.
and Mrs. P. O. Anderson, A. E. Allen,
A. G. Osterberg and S. P. Skahen.
Cambridge Man Fatally Shot.
Alfred Gabrielson, aged 30, single,
of Cambridge, was fatally shot near
Deer River Sunday, by his brother-in
law, Pete Seastrand, as they were
shooting at a target with a 25-30 cal
ibre rifle. Seastrand was unloading
the rifle and it went off, the bullet
passing through Gabrielson's body
near the heart, death resulting in
four hours. Before Ms death he ad
mitted to witnesses that it was his
own fault, as he walked in front of
Seastrand as the latter was unloading
the gun.
Arthur Cahill.
The remains of Arthur Cahill, a
former Princeton boy, who succumbed
to tuberculosis at the City hospital,
Minneapolis, were shipped to Prince
ton Saturday, and the final services
were conducted at St. Edward's Cath
olic church that evening, interment
being made in Oak Knoll cemetery.
St. Edward's Bazaar a Success.
The annual sale and supper under
the auspices of the ladies of St. Ed
ward's Catholic church was the most
successful affair of the kind ever
given by them, and about $500 was
realized. The dinner and supper were
bounteous and appetizing repasts
the tables fairly groaned beneath
loads of eatables cooked to a queen's
taste. The young ladies of the parish
conducted a candy booth, and whole
some home-made candy was there dis
posed of. A good variety of hand
some and useful articles of sewing
were also offered for sale, and brought
good prices. The bazaar was a suc
cess in every respect and the ladies
of the church are sincerely apprecia
tive to the public for the generous
patronage accorded them.
Advantages of Gravel Surfacing.
Assistant Highway Engineer Chafin
is quoted in the Roseau Region as
saying that the cost of maintenance
of clay dirt roads in Roseau county
is about 40 per cent higher than grav
eled roads, and he has reached the con
clusion that this extra cost would pay
for the gravel-surfacing in from three
to five years.
The gravel-sufaced road is not the
ideal road, but it is the nearest ap
proach we can have to the ideal road
for many years to come in this state.
There is no question that a gravel
surfaced road can be properly main
tained at a low cost, and it is travel
able in all kinds of weather.
A Prosperous St. Paul Bank.
At the close of business Nov. 17,
1916, the resources of the Merchants
National Bank of St. Paul were $31,-
499,000.34. The deposits on the above
date were $26,836,160.64.
The Merchants National is one of
the solid financial institutions of the
Northwest,and its officers, all of them
first-class business men, are gentle
manly and accommodating.
The Merchants National is prosper
ing and it deserves to prosper.
A Great Advertisement.
Mille Lacs county is receiving a
great deal of advertising on account of
its road-improvement program for
next year. Newspapers in every sec
tion of the state have made mention
of the $75,000 bond issue coupled with
the $50,000 of Federal aid, and each
and every one of them commends the
enterprise of Mille Lacs county peo
ple. The Morris Tribune remarks,
this will mean probably 100 miles of
smooth country roads in Mille Lacs
county, and will add $10 in value and
a much larger amount in convenience
to every acre of land In the county."
The Tribune might have added that
this will be accomplished without any
increase in the tax rate of the county.
Welcome the Boys Home.
Co. boys are expected to reach
Fort Snelling in a few days,
where they will be mustered out,
which will probably require a week's
time. A committee should be appoint
ed at once to perfect arrangements
to give the boys a royal welcome
home, which should include a big
spread at the Armory. Because the
boys did not see any active service
in the field should not lessen the cor
diality of their welcome. Princeton
gave the boys a good send-off when
they were leaving, let us make them
doubly welcome home and be thank
ful that their ranks have not been
depleted by death.
Rev. and Mrs. Peterson Surprised.
Rev. and Mrs. M. Peterson were the
victims of a most agreeable surprise
Friday evening when about 50 friends
invaded their residence. The self
invited guests had eatables in abund
ance with them, and a bounteous sup
per was spread. A social good time
was had, and before the party broke
up Rev. and Mrs. Peterson were pre
sented with a purse of money and
other gifts. They are more than
grateful to their friends and take
this means to express their apprecia
tion.
Oddfellows Elect Officers.
At the regular meeting of the local
I. O. O. F. lodge Monday evening the
following officers were elected for the
ensuing term: S. J. Smith, Noble
Grand Frank Schilling, Vice Grand
J. H. Hoffman, Recording Secretary
J. C. Herdliska, Financial Secretary
G. A. Eaton, Treasurer F. C. Cater
and J. A. Leathers, Trustees.
Some Job.
Minneapolis politicians rocked the
political boat so hard on November
7th that they shook the republicans
and democrats out and safely landed
a Socialist mayor. Now let him get
busy and show what he can do, and
do it so well that he will be re-elected,
because we've been told time and
again that if there was a place in the
state that was politically worse than
some other place it was Minneapolis,
and it will require the patience of a
Quaker, the prayers of a Billy Sun
day and the cunning of a Socialist to
awaken interest in anything that
doesn't savor of "soft money."Lake

Brings Good Roads at Once.
Mille Lacs county, up where Bob
Dunn lives, ought to present some of
the greatest rural roads in the state
within a few years. A total or $150,000
will be available for road improvement
in the county next year. This vast
sum was secured through the carrying
of a bond issue of $75,000, the state
and federal government meeting the
county's apportionment with a simi
lar sum. This plan brings good
roads at once without waiting a score
of years.Belle Plaine Herald.
St. Paul Unhealthy for Bandits.
The St. Paul system of placing plain

the banks are open, waiting for a hold
up, has proved successful. One hold

The bank bandit bund will no doubt
set up and take due notice of St. Paul's

VISIONARY^ REFORM
Movements to Reduce the Cost of Liv-
ing Inaugurated by Eastern
Politicians Last Week.
Notoriety Seekers Know Nothing of
Present Conditions and Cause
of the High Prices.
The Chicago Packer ventures the
opinion that if competition among the
growers and shippers of produce were
as keen as the competition among
political office-holders, politicians and
reformers who are playing to the
gallery, farm products would be much
lower. New York politicians are com
peting with each other in visionary re
form movements to make themselves
solid with their constituents although
they know practically nothing of pres
ent conditions and reasons why farm
ers are getting high prices for pro
duce. The Packer says::
''Almost every public official in New
York jumped into the daily papers
this week with a scheme for reducing
the high cost of living. By the end of
the week the race was on and they
were all running neck and neck, each
one telling the people just how he was
going to save them money.
"District Attorney Swann announced
Tuesday that he had issued subpoenas
for eight live poultry jobbers to come
before the grand jury. Pat Foy and
Col. Barry, the price currant men, to
gether with Sam Werner and several
other large receivers were interviewed
by the assistant district attorney and
he immediately announced to the pub
lic that indictments would be forth
coming. The district attorney gave
it out that he was after the jobbers
who buy from the large receivers.
These buyers formed a buying pool
several months ago and this is the
combination that was dissolved last
week.
"Then came Police Commissioner
Woods. He took up two columns in
the daily papers spying that he was
going to take a census of all the
storage butter and eggs-in New York,
the prices paid for them and the
prices they are selling at now.
"Then Commissioner John J. Dillon,.
the democratic appointee, being afraid
that several republican officials of
New York city would get ahead of
him, came out again with his old
worn-out proposition to build new ter
minals, have the state sell the goods
and therefore reduce the high cost of
living, and Commissioner John J. said:
'If these storage men don't %ell stor
age eggs for what they are, they will
have to stamp each egg.'
"This of course would add about
one or two cents a dozen to the eggs,
the cost of stamping them.
"Dr. Lucius P. Brown of the city de
partment of health, was interviewed
on the proposition also. Dr. Brown
stopped the 'as is' selling on the
docks here a short time ago. His in
spectors hauled -up dozens of fruit and
vegetable receivers and charged them
with selling products that were not
fit for human consumption. A few
spotted beans on top of a basket got
a produce dealer a fine of $10. Those
spotted beans could be used just now,
but Dr. Brown's campaign during the
summer has kept thousands of pack
ages of good wholesome fruits and
vegetables out of the city. Many
shippers of the country will take no
chances on New York.
sk
"Not one of these reformers has
the remotest idea of the conditions
existing today. They know that
storage eggs went into the coolers last
April at 22c per dozen and they are
selling this week at 37c, but they do
not know that two-thirds of the eggs
in the coolers todty have changed
hands from five to ten times since
April, each buyer making a profit.
Nor do they know that the prices of
dressed poultry all summer have been
extremely high, turkeys selling up to
40c per pound and that the poultry
shippers of the country killed heir
poultry to take advantage of the high
prices, which makes the present pro
duction of eggs very light.
"The/ reformers do not know that
Maine and a few far western states
were about the only ones in the Union
this year that escaped damage to the
potato crop. Frost that swept New
York state, Michican and other north
ern states the latter part of Septem
ber killed the potato vines and stopped
the growth of the potatoes."
Mudholes Helped Him Out.
"Been a wet season in your section
hasn't it?"
"Yep. Hurt my crops, too."
"Will yotf lose'much money?"
"No 111 break about even by haul
ing airtos out of /^nudholes."
