EL PASO, Nov. 29. As a pre-
cautionary measure, additional
troops were ordered down town
fom the fort and army camps to-
night by General Gt'orge Bell,
Jr., artillery was held in readi-
ness on the mesa, overlooking the
city and Juarez, and an armored
automobile wag sent to the inter-
national bridge earlier in ' the
evening. The report of bandit
operations in the vicinity of
Juarez was believed to have been
responsible for this military activ-
ity.
EL PASO, Nov. 29. When a
foreign refugee from Chihuahua
City passed along the Villa Ahu
mada read in his automobile late
today, he reported having seen
185 bandits at Los Tanques, a
small settlement a short distance
southwest of Guadalupe and about
30 miles southeast of Juarez.
He said the column was moving
in the general direction W Villa
Ahumada, south of Juarez, and
were all well armed and equipped.
He was not molested by the ban
dits, he said, as the bead of the
column had passed out of sight
when he passed through Los Tan
ques and he saw only the rear
guard, he said.
U. S. Troops Warned.
United States army officers sta
tioned at Fabens, Texas, 32 miles
southeast 'at here, and opposite
Guadalupe, Chihuahua, were noti
fied that scouts had been despatch
ed south to investigate the pres- ,
ence of bandits so near the bor
der. The Juarez military officers
were also notified of the reported
presence of the bandit force.
k The refugee said he passed a num
ber of bands of bandits between the
city and the border, one band being
encountered near Sauz. He said the
bandits shouted "viva Villa" as he i
passed in bis automobile, the flag of
his country flying on the car. The
bandits did not stop him, he said, nor
fire in his direction. He saw another
band further north, he said, but was
not near enough to ascertain who they
were.

each, two fleet submarines at approxi

three more battleships, one battle
cruiser, and a proportionate number
of other craft remaining on the three

WASHINGTON, Nov. 29. With
the arrival in Washington of mem
bers of congress the subject of
general discussion dminant with
them is the high cost of living and
the food embargo to be urged by
Representative Fitzgerald of New
York as a remedy.
Hot Debate Expected
The discussion has presented a
wide variety of views, some members
believing that an embargo is not the
remedy for existing conditions pnd
that the subject will lead to much de
bate in congress.
Mr. Fitzgerald said today that he
would have two bills ready for intro
duction Monday bearing on the ques
tion of embargoes.
Embargo No Solution
Leader Mann said he did not be
lieve an embargo would be piaced on
food products and that it wa not a
remedy for the evil. An embargo of
fered as a retaliatory measure, in his
opinion, differed greatly from an em
bargo to regulate prices and sufficient
warrant did not exist for a retaliatory
embargo. Representative Borland
doubted the wisdom of an embargo
but thought the soaring pricefc of
foodstuffs could be checked by some
sort of legislation. Representative
McLear was inclined to favor the em
bargo. Property Worth $10,000,000

Absence of Treaty Causes
i America to Fear That No
Indemnity May Be Paid
Details Are Lacking.
(By Review Leaseo Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 29. Consul Put-
I nam at Valencia, Spain, reported to
day that the American steamer Chem
ung was sunk by gunfire and a torpedo
from an Austrian submarine fourteen
miles east of Cape de Gata, Spain.
Nt additional details have been re
ceived officially.
Interest here centered today on the
prospect of extreme difficulty in col
Icting damages for the loss of the
steamer now that it is known that she
was sunk by an Austrian warcraft.
Many authorities have held that under
international law, a boat carrying over
fifty per cent contraband could be
sunk if it were impossible Pot the
captor to get it to port.
; Under the terms of the old Prussian
American treaty, Germany has agreed
to pay for American vessels sunk un
der such circumstances. As Austria
is not in any way bound by that
treaty, the issue would have to be
made on a disputed phrase of interna
tional law.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29. The
United States has set:: n'.tes to
Great Britain and France, it be
came known today, requesting re
consideration by those govern
ments of their refusal to issue a
safe conduct through their block
ade lines to Count Tarnowski, the
new Austri-Hungary ambassador
to this country, and speaking
the unfortunate effect that a con
tinued refusal would have on
: opinion here.
The notes point out that it is
an inalienable right of sovereign
, nations to exchange ambassadors
, and insist that a third nation,
even in time of war, is it ft justi
fied in denying thi right.
Care also is taken not to put the
government in the position of having
changed its attitude since the last
communication on the subject which
was merely the transmission of the
Austrian government's request for a
safe conduct. ,
U. S. May Demand
It was planned at first when the re
buff was received to drop the position
of being a messenger of Austria and
make a formal demand in the name
of the United States.
It was decided, however, that it was
unnecessary to take such action at
this stage of the negotiations. If the
present note meets with an unsatis
factory response it is admitted that a
very different situation will be devel-
j oped.
j Diplomats Alarmed
The allied embassies are deeply
j concerned over the resentment felt
j by the Washington government and
are taking unusual care to keep their
governments fully informed. It is not
known that they have forwarded any
direct representations to their gov
ernments except in so far as the nat
ure of their information is in itself
a recommendation. Nevertheless of
ficials have every hope that this in
formal action by the diplomatic rep
resentatives of the governments will
go far toward influencing the attitude
on the other side.
Quick Reply Expected
Early replies to the American notes
are expected owing to the fact that
Count Tarnowski is scheduled to sail
from Rotterdam on the Dutch steam
er Nieu Amsterdam on December 6.
Should the replies prove unfavorable
the United States might send a final
note notifying the allies to disturb
