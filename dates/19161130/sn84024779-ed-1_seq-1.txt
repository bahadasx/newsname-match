THE WAHPETON TIMES
WAHPETON, RICHLAND COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY NOVEMBER 30th, 1916.
SECRETARY'S REPORT ON THE BUSINESS AFFAIRS OF THE
RICHLAND COUNTY FAIR ASSOCIATION FOR THE YEAR
OF 1916.
It gives me great pleasure to submit herewith, a statement of
the business affairs of the Richland County Fair Association for
the year of 1916 just closed^.
In doing so, the management has every reason to believe that
under the most frying conditions which prevailed from early
Spring, to that week of the opening of the Fair, when faced by un
certain weather and a poor harvest, that it proved to be one of
the best fairs in every particular, since its organization eleven years
ago.
That while there was a slight falling off in some of our re
sources, in others it equaled that of the year of 1915.
It is too gratifying to know that instead of a defciit to face
which many contemplated1 that there are no debts of any import
ance, to mar the onward progress of the Association for the com
ing year.
The exhibits in all Departments were surprisingly large aid
ot tine quality, while the cash premiums paid were qual to that
of the preceeding year.
