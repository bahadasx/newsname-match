It is absolutely impossible to give you any idea of the
quality, flavor and richness of STONE'S "RICH FRUIT"
CAKE through the medium of paper and ink".
We could easily use a column in telling you about the
that go into it—Pineapples from Hawaii, Al
aonds from Spain, Pecans from Texas, Cherries from
California, and so on through the list of twelve fruits that
ire used—but what good does it do to name them over,
when the deliciousness is only half in the materials, the
other half being the art and skill with which they * are
combined to make the perfect FRUIT CAKE.

LOOMS LARGER DAILY
More Ooodfellows To The Square lo Morgan City Than
> Any Other Town In The Land
By Banta
Do you make Thanksgiving resolu
tions the same as you do on New
Years? On this day of Thanksgiving
for the benefits you have received
permit me to suggest that you think
one thought of a certain crowd of
kleine, tousel-headed urchins who
aint go^ nothin' and hardly that.
Dont rush the thought. Let it linger
long enough for you to register the
resolution that not another week
shall pass before you slide into line
with the Goodfellows who are hold
ing out on their own folks in order to
come clean with a few jits for poor
folks Christmas. If you're timid
about having your name in print
jest think what a trial them already
in line has had to go thru
with. Why there aren't a name
in the list but what objects to pub
licity from the littlest kid to the big
gest bank; haven't they said as how
they hate to see their names in the
paper? Now, be brave and sacrifice
your personal disinclination to undue
publicity and come across with the
price of a rattle or a tin horn or a
doll or some other such necessary
rubbish. Dont you know your dime
will buy a bundle of joy for some
teensy, hard-luck jungling that wont
have no Santa unless you're it?
You wont be lonesome in the list
of Goodfellows. You want to be a-'
mong those present and you cer
tainly belong. Dont wait so long to
do something that you have already
made up your mind to do. Its some
time to Christmas, but you might get
sick, or die or leave or some other
calamity overtake you and you with
out have done nothin for the kids.!.,
The mananna habit is alright when
applied to work, but when you're got
something to give away, do it quick,
then you can «forget it sooner. j

QUICK DELIVERY OF
MAIL IN CITIES
The delivery of letters, especially
in the large cities, is fre
quently delayed and oftimes made
impossible by the omission of an im
portant part of the address, such
as the street number, or room num
ber addressed, to an office building.
Not infrequently the name of the
street is omitted, only the name of
the post office and State being given.
Another source of trouble is the
practice of giving an address at the
intersection of two streets without
giving the location of the corner,
for in some large cities a number of
carrier routes may terminate at that
point or it may be the dividing line
between the respective territories of
the post office and a station or be
tween two stations, and in the ab
sence of the notation "N. E.'\ "N.
W.", etc., the distributors are un
able to determinate to which carrier
the mail should be thrown.
Complete and accurate addresses
are essential to prompt mail delivery
and you are earnestly requested to
co-operate with the Post Office De
partment to the extent that all mail
posted by you bears a street num
ber, or in the case of an office build
ing the room number, in addition to
the name of the city and State.
By observing these suggestions
you will greatly assist in the prompt J
handling of your mail matter. When- j
ever a letter does not bear the suf
ficient address, as outlined above, Yt
requires the necessity of rehandling
and search entailing a waste of time.
If the proper address is furnished by
the sender all mail is promptly dis
patched to the proper addresses.
•You should also furnish your return
address in order to facilitate to the
post office that handles same to make
prompt return in case it should be
unclaimed, refused or delivery made
impossible.

Postmaster.

THANKSGIVING DAY
That we're at peace with all the
World
Safe in our cities and or homes.
That unto this, our favored land,
Such gift, with all its blessings,
comes,
That men go not to war and death,
That women do not fearful brood
By anxious hearts for dear ones gone
We thank Thee, Giver of all good.
i
That no ambitious strife is ours,
That lust of conquest does; not
thrill
This mighty nation's inmost heart.
That we abhor to burn and kill,
That weaker nations we protect,
Fight to make their wronging
cease.
And only come to make them free,
We thank Thee, God of love and
peace.
That is the stress around us now,
We feel our hearts with pity throb
And,haste to heal the wounded man
To hush the child and woman's sob
That we are eager still to share
The goods that heap our stores
again,
With those who have but us to help,
We thank Thee, Father of all
men!
