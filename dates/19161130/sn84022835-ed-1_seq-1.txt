McCook Defeats Red Cloud .
By a Score of 17 to 6
McCook won her second victory of
tlio season Friday afternoon by de
feating the fast Red Cloud aggrega
tion to the tune of 17 to G. Tho game
wafe McCook's thuout, altho Red Cloud
was strung on the defense.
In the first quarter, McCook kicked
to Red Cloud, who returned the ball to
their thirty yard line, then lost it on a
fumble. McCook then took possession
of the ball and wont down the field
with line plunges, Cliff Hcgenbcrger
going over for a touchdown and"
then kicking goal. McCook kicked to
Red Cloud and this timo the visitors
returned the ball to the forty yard
line and lost on downs. After two
successful attempts to make gains
thru Red Cloud by center rushes,
Halfback Gatowood kicked a field
goal from thirty yard line making the
score 10 to 0.
In tho second quarter, McCook
swept the field in great offensive
drives (war dope) tearing the Red's
line assunder and taking trench after
trench of the white chalk lines till
Gatewood plunged over their bar
ricks for another touchdown. With
Elegetiberger kicking goal, MoCook ad
vanced bcr score to 17 to 0
McCook received the ball in the
third quarter and returned for thirty
yards losing on downs. Red Cloud
puutod out of bounds and McCook
lost on a fumble. Red Cloud then
played for heavy gains thru McCook's
line and was successful in pushing the
pig skin over for six points but failed
to kick goal. During this part of the
game, McCook's line seemed to "weak
en, especially the left side thru whioh
most of the gains were made. The
remaiudcr of the' battle was without
sensational play consisting mostly of
line bucks and a sea saw between the
two Bides. Regenberger, T. Gatewood
and V. Gatowood starred for the lo
cals while Barrett of the visiting
eleven deserves Rpecial mention Hod
Willow County Gazette.
On Saturday afternoon an accident
occured in this city whioh might easily
have caused the death of two of our
residents. Messrs. Lon linker and Ii,
L Castor were seated ou the iron
guard rail, around tho stairway lead
ing to the entrance of the Hunt barber
shop, on the north side of the Potter
building. The railing gave Way caus
ing tho twogenlcmen to fall backward
down the stairway. The former re
ceived only slight injuries while t$e
latter was badly injured. At the pres
ent time we are informed that ho is
doing as well us can be expected
