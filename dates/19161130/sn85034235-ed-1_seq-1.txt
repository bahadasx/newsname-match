One View cf the Giudy of Latin.
If one does not study tilings because
tney "train the mind," why, then,
should one study them? The answer
Is extraordinarily simple. One studies
things because they serve a purpose.
I do uot say, mark you, a useful pur
pose, but a purpose—a valid purpose, a
genuine purpose, not a make believe
purpose.
Mental discipline is uot a valid or
genuine purpose—it's a make believe.
Meanwhile the number of purposes, of
genuine, valid purposes, is simply ln
finite. Learning to read Vergil is, of
course, just as valid a purpose as learn
ing to play a symphony or learning to
bake n pumpkin pie. The test is, how
ever, not. Did the student get mental
discipline? but Can be read and en
joy Vergil? Can he play the symphony?
Will some one eat the pie?
And because people rarely care to
read Vergil, because almost none of
the thousands who study Latin ever
can or'do read Vergil, therefore. In fo
far as they are concerned, studying
Latin has no purpose and err;foot bo
defended as mental discipline.—Abra
ham Flexner in Atlantic Monthly.

It has* been calculated that a single
tree is able through its leaves to purify
the air from the carbonic acid arising
from the respiration of a considerable
number of men. perhaps a dozen or
even more. The volume of carbonic
acid exhaled by a human being In the
course of tweutv-four hours is put at
about 100 gallons, but by Boussin
ganit's estimate a single yard of leaf
surface, counting both the upper and
the under side of the leaves, can. in
favorable circumstance s, decompose at
least a gallon of carbonic acid a day
One hundred square yards of leaf sur
face then would suffice to keep the
air pure for one man, but the leaves
of a tree of moderate size present a
surface of many hundred square
yards. All other forms of vegetable
life act similarly in abstracting the
noxious carbonic acid from the atraos

The Art of Optimism.
Live in the active voice, intent on
what you can do rather than ou what
happens to you; in the indicative mood,
concerned with facts as they arc rather
than as they might be; in (ho present
tense, concentrated on the duty in
hand without, regard for the past or
worry about the future; in (he first
person, criticising yourself-rather than
condemning others; in the singular
number, seeking the approval of your
own conscience rather than popularity
with the many. Whoever lives the life
of such unselfish devotion to the good
of others and of all and lives it in the
active voice, indicative mood, present
tense, first person, singular number, is
bound to find ids life full and rich and
glad and free- is bound, hi other words,
to be an optimist..— William De Witt

Jacob Whittle, newly elected town
councilor, was excited. He rushed up
the stairs to the office of Martin Good
blind, who had been president of the
board for a time so long that the mem
ory of man runneth uot to the contrary
"Martin," Jacob began shrilly as he
burst into the room and mopped bis
brow with a huge blue handkerchief
"we been neglectin' our duty—not
kuowiniy, Martin, nor delib'rateiy, bu;
neglectin' all the same. What d'you

Martin leaned forward, his jaw set

"Worse! Worse'n that! Andwho'd evei
thought one of 'em would 'a' growed
up right here iu tsand Hill? it's a mo
nopoly, Martin—one of them graspin',
griudtu', unholy monopolies, that's
what it in!"
"Who's monopolizin' in Sand Hill?'
asked Martin.
"it's our one and only public service
concern. It's our bus line, that's what
it is! It's Barney Beagle. Look this
thing in the eye, Martin, and tell me
if there's any competition. Does any
one else own a bus? What other feller
carries passengers and trunks to the
depot? Nobody! Barney Beagle holds
us in the holler of his hand. He's
grasped off this here necessity and Is
ruunin' it to suit himself. I tell you.
Mali in Goodhaud, if he fcjok a notion
he could raise the fare from the depot
to the hotel to a quarter instead of 10
cents, that's what he could do. He
could charge folks 50 cents fori tailin'
'em and their baggage to a train, and
we couldn't raise, a hand to percent

"What's your idee?" Martin asked.

"Cal! a rneetin' of the council and

The village councilors were called to
get'uer. and Jacob Whittle's discovery
was laid before them. One and all sat
aghast at the calamity that had well
nigh overtaken them, and one and all
gazed on Jacob with eyes of admira
tion and envy.
"Has Barney been sent for?" de
manded Jacob.
"He's cornin' up the street now. I

Abel Martin.

"IJOLLAK'N A HALF!" GROANED JACOB
There came a clatter ou the stairs, and
Barnabas Beagle entered noisily
"Afternoon, gentlemen, one and nUT
he roared. "What kin 1 do far y*i?
Tickled to death to be of service in the
council!"
"Sit down!" President Goodhami or
dered sternly. »"It's been discovered
that you're a monopoly. Know what
n monopoly is?"
••j caic'late it's where a feller ha
got all there is of It and is reaeliin' out
for more."
"You've got the idee, all right That
describes you to a tec. You've got all
the busses there is. am! for all wo
know you may be stretchin out afier
moi e."
Barnabas looked from one council >;
t-> another, and h > eyes disappeared
jn a mass of wrinkles that always
came at tne commencement of a laugh.
Then ho opened Ids mouth and roared
until the lamp in its bracket threaten
ed to fall.
"Geni lernen, one and ail." he said,
ivilh solemnity, "yuu're right- it
hadn't never occurred to me before—
never. I'm what you said—one of them
monopolies. It's a mean tiring to he
and n hard name îo 1-e called, but. like
the dag said when lie killed the sheep
and was wonderin' whether to eat it. I
might as weil have th&r game as the
name. Therefore, gentlemen, one and
all, bein' 's I'm a monopoly. I'm a-goin'
to monopolize a little.Hollerin' out
that line of argvmeut from and after
the present minute, my rates for car
ryiu' folks from the depot to the hotel
Is 25 cents, and for .cartin' 'em from
their houses to the train is half a dol
lar."
With that Mr. Beagle stamped out.
"We got to fight!" Jacob rasped.
"We wiil uot be trod on. We'll run a
competin' line, and we won't charge
but half of Barney's old prices. Then
we'll see where he'll be with his mo
nopoly!"
Meantime Barnabas. Beagle hurried
to the printing office atid had printed
two huge placards, with black letters,
on red paper, reading: i -
BARNABAS BEAGLE
Et'3 MONOPOLY
Prlee3 Doubled and Oustofn Solicited
These lie fastened, oûe on each side
of his bus. and drove noisily down
Main street.
Jacob 'Whittle, with the burden of
the campaign on ids wi&iflg shoulders,
gave thought to ways and means
First, it was clear, a conveyance caps
hie of transporting passengers and bag
gage must be had. Forman hour Jacob
vainly endeavored to s<rele this ohsta
clo. but his Indomitable will finally led
him to a path that might reach its
crest
The path took the shape of the vil
lage band wagon, a cumbersome affair
on wheels, consisting of a huge wood
en body, with long, parallel, cloth up
holstered seats. It was-.uncovered, but
would serve its purpose.' Jt was owned
by Ileimy Richards.
Forth sallied Jacob to the Richards
home, where, behind the barn, stood
the objective vehicle, tile summoned
Henny, who emerged from the barn.
"You'd be willin' to dp a service for
the community?'! asked Jacob, rub

"Depends some on the. «orrlce." be
hesitated. L
"If It was tendin' the village this

ed the diplomatic Jacob.
"Gratis?" asked Henny.
"Ggaiis." -nodded Jacob.
"In that there case." Henny said
positively. "I feel my public spirit ooz
in' out rapid. Besides. I've"—
At this moment Barnabas Beagle ap
pea red around flic corner of the barn,
ne glanced at Jacob and nodded. "1
came to see you." he said, addressing
Henny. "about rentin' thin oM band
wagon of your'n."
"But." Henny wheezed.
"I want to hire it for a few weeks."
declared Barnabas.
Jacob seized Henny by the arm.
"I was here first!" he said excitedly.
"I came first!"
"To borrow, not to hire." observed
*Hennv. who had resumed hi« usua
calm.
"I'll pay—I'll pay!" exclaimed Jacob
"How much?"
"Fifty cents a day."
Barnabas grunted scornfully.
"I'll give 7Ö cents." he said.
Jacob glared at the monopolist. "A
dollar!" he shouted.
"And n quarter," hid Barnabas.
"Pollav'n a half!" groaned Jacob, his
face working convulsively.
"Two dollars." raised Barnabas.
Jacob hesitated until he saw Henny
turn to hie. rival and open his mouth
"Two'n a half!" he bellowed.
Barnabas was silent.
"It's your'n." observed Henny.
"Cash in advance!"
Jacob paid over a day's rental with
reluctance, his eyes fixed on the pro
prietor of the local monopoly with a
baleful glare. He even shook h!s fist.
"This'll come out of you. Barney
Beagle!" he vowed. "You'll be made
to pay!"
Barnabas smiled tolerantly, and
Henny Richards doubled up with sup
pressed laughter. Presently the latter
recovered enough to ask if Jacob de
sired horses and a driver.
"I kin rent 'em to you and drive my
self."
"How much?"
"Two dollars a day for the bosses
and a dollar a day for me."
Jacob recognized the prico as reason
able and closed at once. His campaign
against monopoly was costing $->50
a day. and he was pledged to carry
fares at half Barnabas' old rate He
hoped the opposition would be unable
to hold out long against such cmnpeti
tion.
The following morning the active
campaign opened. Henny appeared at
the depot platform on the seat of the
l and wagon just as Barnabas drove up
on bis bus: Barney's s'-gn was still
displayed. On the band wagon was a
legend which begged alt public spirited
people to help break the monopoly and
save money at the same time. Prices
o? 5 cents to the hotel and lf> cents
elsewhere were offered. Barnabas se
ronel.y made demand for u quarter to
the ho« -1 and 50 cents iseyond.
The-train drew in. and a dozen pen
pie «lighted. Two were traveling men
with heavy grips, and with gtrdshor.tr.

thru tiir -iv their baggage on the root
and entered the has.
Two other individuals chose the band
wagon. Next came Higgins the grocer,
returning from the city. He took in
the situation at a glance and with wry
mouth climbed into Barnabas' convey
ance. Four strangers took the baud
wagon, all passengers beyond the ho
tel. That was all.
That afternoon Jacob approached
Grocer Higgins frowningly.
"What's the matter?" he demanded.
"Ain't you goin' to heip bust the mo
nopoly? Bo you goin' to let a restraint
cf trade rob you?''
"When Barney Beagle Is it 1 am."
said Higgins. "His trade is wuth more
to me than savin' a quarter two or
three times a year."
So matters went on for a couple of
weeks, the reformers spending $5.50
for their conveyance each day and nev
er taking in more than $2 in fares.

cut ipto, of course.
Jacob alone of tiie councilmen was
indomitable, and he inspired his col
leagues to fight on for another'week,
"Ile'H never hold out," Jacob reit
crated. "He's got to come to terms
He's got to! Then we kin git an iron
clad agreement out of him, and his
monopoly wiil be b Jsted We'll be a file

But Barnabas did not surrender, and
afier (he fourth week (lie village conn

to bo heard of longer. Besides, the
town lawyer (old them, that it might
come out of their own pockets if any

of this, Barnabas promptly lodged a
formal protest.
Forthwith the monopolist was sum

"Be you willin' to sign a agreement
to let this Itéré council fix your rate of
faro?" demanded Jacob.
"Now, Mr. Whittle," said Barnabas
in a pained voice, "how could I cTo
that? Maybe foil'd have me carrvin'
folks for a cent a ride."
"You're a 4M legal monopoly!" shouted
Jacob.
"Maybe so; maybe so. 'Tain't my
fault. Nobody knew it till you found
it out."
"Yon raised your prices."
Here Martin Goodhand made ills
presence felL
"If we pull off our band wagon will
you promise lo come back to your old
prices and stay there? You're losin
money every day."
Barnabas made no reply, and Martin
kicked the table in disgust. His anger
got the t »etter of him.
"We'il show you, Barney Beagiei
You can't go playin' uo tricks on us.
We'il fight this here thing to a finish
if every cent has to come out o' my
own pocket. Vv'e'ii bust you!"
"Jest a minute," returned Barnabas
soothingly. "Let's talk this over quiet.
Let's see how long it's gain' to take to
bust me and how much it'll cost you to
do it. Let's jest see. Now. 1 guess I
roc'llect right—you're payin' two-fifti
a day for that old band wagon, eh?"
Martin nodded.
"And two a day for the bosses?"
Again a nod.
"Who ho you payin' it to?"
"Henny Richards, of course."
"Lm," grunted Barney. "Now let's
look at me. I'nr rankin' a livin' with
my Inis. Even with the fullin' off in
trade I been cornin' within n dollar a
day of what I made before. But"—he
paused and grinned amiably at Jacob
"I got other resources."
Everybody sat erect and stared.
"What d'you mean?" demanded Mm
tin.
"1 got !» crowd of village councilors
helpin'* me out," Barnabas explained,
with a broad grin; "payin' me a matter
of four-fifty a day. and two-fifty o!
that is clear profit."
"What?" roared Martin, seconded by
Jacob Whittle.
"That gives me a dollar an' a half
more profit than I was makin' before."
Barnabas pointed out. "You see. Hen
ny Richards don't own that band wag
on nor them bosses."
"What?" shouted the council.
"No," replied Barnabas happily. "1
bought 'em From Henny just before
Jacob turned up to borrow 'em."
"And then Lid agin me to raise the
hire!" yelled Jacob.
"You was wantin' competition." said
Barnabas.
Martin Goodhand arose slowly.
"I guess we got it. all right—plenty

Barnabas walked to the door, recog

The Climax of Mathswson's Fame as a
Easebail Pitcher.
We always have believed that the
greatest game that Mat'aewson ever
pitched was the eighth and deciding
contest between Boston and New York
in the world's series of 1012. He
should have shut the Red Sox out in
that battle, but his team faltered and
broke behind him, and Boston finally !
won in ten innings bv a score of 3 to 2.
Matty had been the unanimous choice
of his comrades. He feit that it might
bo the last world's series game he ever
would pitch, anil he put into his work
all the cunning and skill that the years
had given him. In those ten innings
he gave everything lie had, and it was
a marvelous exhibition of twirling.
When he entered the box his step
was springy and his head UP id high.
He looked almost boyish. When he
left the mound after the game it was
with bent head and lagging feet, but
the Boston crowd stood up iu the
stands and cheered, not their team,
which had just won the world's cham
pionship, but the defeated Mntliewson
Hard headed ball players had tears

FREE FROM BEETLES.
Spitzbergen Is the Only LanJ In the
World Without Them.
One of the most amazing things in
natural history is the way in which
beetles have triumphed in the struggle
for existence, says Ihe Popular Science
Monthly. Of ali creatures they are by
far the most numerous, uo fewer than
150,000 distinct species having been
identified--three times the number of
backboned animals.
Beeties are found practically every
where—In the frost bound tracts of
Iceland and in the hot desert sands of
Africa, on the highest mountains, un
der the ground and as fossil in the
deepest strata, on land and in water,
on plants, among stones and tn wood
and earth and even in the very craters
of volcanoes.
But there Is one place where no beetle
has yet been found. It is the inhospi
table land of Spitzbergen, to the north
of Russia. Hero arc found the main
mais, birds, fish, mollusks, crustaceans,
a few insects of varied species and
many spiders, but not a single beetle.
While other insects have succeeded
in some way in migrating from the
mainland, the "beetles have apparently
lieen unable to cross the wide, ley
waters.
When Parasols Began.
Parasols when they first came Into
use must have been cumbersome
Henri Estienne, writing in 157S, speaks
of a parasol as capable generally of
sheltering'four persons from the sun.
And when they diminished in circum
ference the material still remained of
the heaviest. Ited velvet parasols,
with heavy gold fringes, were carried
by ladies of fashion in the days of
Louis XIV. At that time it was possi
hie when crossing a bridge in Paris to
hire a panisol at one end and deposit
it at the other, the charge for the
accommodation being a son. Under
the regency fashion went to the other
extreme. Men's parasols folded into
the shape of a three cornered hat and
could thus be carried elegantly under
the arm. Ladies' parasols were hinged
so that they could slip into the pocket,
for ladies had pockets then.—London
Spectator.
Seven Bells.
Everybody who knows anything
about nautical matters understands the
methods of keeping time at sea—eight
bells every four hours. From 0 to 8 in
the evening is the second dogwatch,
but on British ships seven bells (half
past 7i of the .second dogwatch are
never struck. All other ships, even the
American, strike these hells. During
the Napoleonic wars there was a great
mutiny, in the British navy. The crews
of the fleets lying at Splthead and the
Note agreed to rise simultaneously
against their officers. The signal
agreed upon was seven Deli - of the
second dogwatch. The mutiny actually
began at tiie arranged time, but failed,
the ringleaders being executed Ever
since then seven bells of the second
-dogwatch has never been struck on
British ships, naval or mercantile

ORIGIN OF PUNCHINELLO.
A Memory cf the Day3 When Harper'*
Weekly Was a Power,
in the days when Harper's Weekly
was at the height of its poftuiarity and
influence it commanded the services of
the foremost Illustrators in America,
including the cartoonists. Every once
in awhile a group of these artists
would become dissatisfied with the
»Harper parental control and would
lenve to establish an independent illus
trated paper.
Having squandered their substance
in riotous printing, these artists would
come to themselves and return to the
Harper home, where was bread enough
and to spare. No fatted calf was killed
oh the return of such prodigals, but
Henry Mills Ahlen, the veteran editor
of Harper's Monthly Magazine, assert
ed that the house of Harper never held
a grudge against any contributor,
whether artist or writer, who left to
try other pastures. Such was the ori
gin an.l such was the end of Puiv-U
ineilo, a comic cartoon weekly which
first appeared in New York city on
April 2,- IS70.
in calling attention to the fact that
the first number was dated the first
day after All Fools' day, Punchinello
remarked: "This is cheering, since
thus it is muni fest that Pun- hinello
leaves all the fools and jesters behind
and is therefore first in the race for
the crown of comic laurel and the
quiver of satiric shafts." During its
short life—less than a year—it was
entitled to that.honor.—Cartoons Maga

an engine could ho built which would
accumulate all the power of the waves,
since the tide makes tiie waves and the
moon-makes the tide, we could use this

Bar.'t Eo Envioua.
Crush all envy out of your heart. The
envious person is in pain upon all cc
casions which ought to give him pleas
ure. The relish of his life is lost, and
the objects which administer the high

to it. All the perfections of their fel
low creatures are odious. Don't bo
envious.
