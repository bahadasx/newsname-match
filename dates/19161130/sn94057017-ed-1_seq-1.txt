TheN. M. C. train Saturday
and also a special run on Sunday
were packed with teachers going
to the state meeting in Santa Fe,
until standing room in the aisles
was at a premium, Some of the
Estancia teachers went by auto,
and most of the balance went on
Sunday. There is no school
this week, and the youngsters
are having a lark too. Most of
the teachers will return on a
special train to-day.
There is some newspaper dis
cussion as to what the legislature
ought to do this winter, and
among other things the matter
of a primary law has been
broached. The Albuquerque
Journal is much opposed to a
primary law, and advances the
stock argument that under a
primary system the manipulators
of politics and the wealthy have
it all their own way, while the
poor man and the man little
known stand no show at all. But
it ia a singular fact that the po
litical manipulators are unani
mously and vehemently opposed
to the primary system. How
ever, there isn't the slightest
danger of the legislature just
elected passing a primary law.

The statement of the Estancia
Savings Bank published in this
issue is a mighty interesting one
to every man who ia intereated
in the development of the coun
ty. It will be observed that the
individual deposits subject to
check foot up above $144,000.
Heretofore this item has for the
past year or two run around
$80,000 sometimes a little above,
sometimes a little below that
figure. The statement under
consideration was made on No
vember 17th, and the deposits
have largely increased since that
date. On Tuesday, November
28th eleven days "after the date
of the statement, this item of de
posits shows on the bank books
above $175,000. Presumably the
deposits of the Torrance County
Savings Bank at Willard have
increased in a like ratio, in which
event the total deposits in the
county probably reach $400,000.
inere was a time nve or
six years ago when the deposits
in the county amounted to only
about $60,000, ami possibly they
have been lower than that. In
this connection, too, it should
be remembered that in years
past the exigencies of business
has taken many accounts to
Santa Fe and Albuquerque banks,
besides the accounts originating
there before the days of banka
in the county and which have
continued because men don't
like to change, and the accounts
carried by business concerns with
headquarters outside the county.
There is no way of ascertain
ing what these deposits amount
to, but they must be heavy.
Tn this innnprt.inn it mav hp
. . ...
paraonaDie to say man residents
of the county would consult their
own interests by doing their
banking within the county when
ever possible. There is no bet
ter way to build up the county.
It strengthens the home banks
and enables them to give the
home people better service.

M. E. LADIES' AID
The Ladies' Aid of the M, E.
church met at the home of Mrs.
Elgin on Tuesday afternoon with
fourteen members and two vis
itors present. The afternoon
waa pleasantly spent in tacking
comforts, finishing up two.
A business meeting was called
at four o'clock, and with the
proceeds from the dinner, dues,
etc., $65 00 had been taken in
since the last meeting, which
will enable the Aid to help boost
the work of the church financial
ly.
One new member was added
to our membership.
The ladies tendered a vote of
thanks to the ladies who so kind
ly assisted with the dinner and
supper, each ona having her part
in making it such a success. And
especially do they thank those
who so kindly assisted that were
neither members of the Aid nor
of the courch.
The next meeting will be Tues
day, December 5th with Mrs.
Clay Keen, and tacking comforts
will be the order of the day. The
president kindly insists that
every member of the Aid be
present as officers will be elected.
Visitors are welcome.

Walter Elam is one of those
who have cause to love the hum
ble bean. He has been in pretty
hard straits the past few years.
This year he raised 33 acres of
beans which brought him $56.06
an acre. Yesterday he pocketed
a check for $1,849 98. This puts
him over the fence. After squar
ing up and buying horses which
he needed, he will have money
enough to build a comfortable
house, which he also needed.

THE EXPLANATION
Mountainair, N. M.,
Nov. 20, 1916.
Editor News-Herald:
Ordinarily the anonymous
writer without the courage to
sign what he writes ior publica
tion merits no consideration, and
but for the very great importance
of the subject referred to by
"Interested Citizens" in a re
cent issue, I would give them at-
ter no lurcher attention. . In
terested Citizens" assumes a
very manifest antagonistic atti
tude toward the subject, indicat
ing bias and political Dartisan-
ship to begin with; and also very
evidently goes a long way round
co misconstrue the plain English
contained in my former com
munication. It is this antagon
istic attitude which constitutes
one of the greatest discourage
menta in any attempt to make
conditions better. I am afraid
"Interested Citizens" is hunting
argument rather than informa
tion. I refuse to enter into a
newspaper discussion with any
one unless I am convinced that
he is honestly seeking for infor
mation that will lead to some
thing better. However, for the
enlightenment of your anonymous
correspondent, and in the inter
est of progress along religious
and political life, I will say that
there is a woeful waste of energy
in the management of the church,
due I think largely to the urowth
and development of the denom
inational idea. I think this ia
admitted by all who have really
studied the question.
1 have lontr been convinced
that our civil government cobis
more than double what it should.
and I think it is a matter which
can be easily proven. Any how,
my proposition to conduct the
business of Torrance county for
one-half of what it is now cost
ing was not made blindly, and if
Interested Citizens or any one
else thinks I am bluffing I sug
gest they call my bluff. Both of
these matters should be consid
ered from the standpoint of com
mon sense, and without religious
or political bias, and unless they
are considered in this' way noth
ing wilt fc gained by farther dis
cussion. John W. Corbett.
