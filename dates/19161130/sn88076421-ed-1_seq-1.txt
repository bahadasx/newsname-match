ALL READY TOR
THE BIG EQUITY
CONVENTION
Men of National Prominence to Speak
at Annual Meeting of Farmers at
St. Paul Next Week.
Seven thousand visitors will be in
St. Paul Dec. 5th, 6th and 7th, at­
tracted by the Equity Farmers' con­
vention. One of the big features of
the convention program will be the
formal dedication of the $250,000 ter­
minal elevator now nearing comple­
tion on the river front. It is the first
purely co-operative terminal elevator
ever erected anywhere.
But significant as is the completion
of the elevator project, it is second in
importance to the great plan that will
be laid before the convention for a
vast national co-operative marketing
and buying organization of which it is
planned to make St. Paul the head­
quarters.
If this is accomplished many mil­
lions of dollars will be cleared thru
St. Paul annually to cover the tre­
mendous buying and selling activities
of this organization. F. A. Bennett,
of Great Falls, Mont., for months has
devoted almost all of his time to ad­
vocating this plan in addresses to var­
ious state farmers' societies. The
coming convention is certain to foe one
of vast importance to St. Paul and the
Northwest.
Men of prominence from east and
west, in addition to those vitally
known thruout the Northwest, are on
the program and will: speak on var­
ious subjects in connection with the
co-operative farmers' movement dur­
ing the three days of the convention.
Assistant Secretary Fred E. Osborne
of the Equity Exchange at St. Paul,
stated that he had succeeded in secur­
ing acceptance to speak from the fol­
lowing: Robert Bridges, from Seat­
tle, Wash., president of the Port Com
missibn, who is an authority on ship­

HOME ECONOMICS AT THE
MINOT NORMAL SCHOOL
Science—Not Guess Work
Among the most interesting sub­
jects the Normal school curriculum
offers those grouped together under
the general heading Home Economics.
This is one of our newer departments,
being now in its second year. But in
the short time it has been established
some very gratifying results have been
obtained and some unusual opportuni­
ties for studying household problems
have been offered. From the begin­
ning, it has been popular with the
students and the enrollment has
doubled and trebled each succeeding
term. All the courses offered in this
department are elective.
There are many factors that make
for this popularity. First of all ,per­
haps, is a girl's inherent love of home
and the work of making it an inter­
esting and attractive place in which to
live. Then there is the present day
reawakened interest in the problems o*
the home and the application of sci­
entific methods to every day affairs.
This very application of science to
our daily problems has created a new
home-making. Formerly housekeep­
ing was regarded as something to be
learned by imitation, and infant mor
•'tality, disease, inefficiency and ill-con
sidered expenditures were tolerated
because of lack of knowledge of a bet­
ter way. But the better knowledge
now exists and the spirit of our day
demands that it be brot home by ed­
ucation.
Minimum Cost—Maximum Service
Every class serves two meals each
term either to a student or outside or­
ganization. The present class has
served two. The first was an elabor­
ate four-course men's dinner at which
state and local officials to the number
of forty were guests. The other was
a three-course luncheon served to a
student organization. These meals are
served in an adjoining room and are
entirely in the hands of the students.
They work out the menu, compute the
cost, arrange the table and its decora­
tions, prepare and serve the meal. This
class succeeded, in spite of the present
prices, in serving tne student organ-
t''
ization of forty people with whole­
some and abundant meal at a total
cost of five dollars and twenty cents,
an average cost of fourteen cehts a
plate. And flour is $5.40 and sugar
$8.25 a hundred!
Practical Features Prominent
The first of the household subjects
to find a place in the public school
curricula were those related to cloth­
ing, variously designated as domestic
art, sewing, dressmaking, and the like.
What crimes have been committed in
its name. Hours and hours have been
wasted in making samples and utter­
ly useless trimming for defenseless
bath towels. With us, the newer prac­
tice of making articles of value in
themselves and elminating all samples
is practiced. Even in the grades the
girls delight in making garments for
themselves until at commencement the
first to fit their dolls, but later to fit
eighth grade girls appear in simple
white dresses of their own making. In
the Normal department the same ex­
cellent practice is followed. Sewing
is taught by means of garment-mak­
ing, textiles, in connection with the
fabrics used in making these gar­
ments. Realizing the importance of
economizing time, machine sewing, the
use of labor saving devices, such as
machine attachments and commercial
patterns are taught along with hand
sewing and pattern drafting by means
of the straight line method.
The important subjects of house­
hold management, house furnishing
and decoration, the keeping of house­
hold budgets, sanitation and home care
of the sick are all provided for in our
courses in Household Management
and Sanitation. These'are not merely
theoretical, but practical as well.
PRES. W.S. SHAW
APPEARS BEFORE
DIRECT
Proposed Bond Issue for Better Wat­
erworks Explained tfl the Associa­
tion of Commerce.
President W. S. Shaw of the city
commission appeared' before the
board of directors of the Minot as­
sociation of commerce Tuesday after­
noon, and explained the proposed bond
issue for the extension of the water­
works system for the city of Minot.
It seems that the city commission
has been busily engaged trying to find
an adequate supply of pure water in
wells, instead of using the Mouse riv­
er water that has to be chemically
treated before it is fit for household
consumption. It has been found also
that the present system of water­
works is inadequate and uncertain on
account of the small storage capacity
of the tank on the south hill, and
from the further fact that there is
only one line of water main from the
plant to the tank on the hill.
Three small wells have been put
down on city property near the Nor­
thern Briquetting Co.'s plant in the
western part of the city, and excellent
water has been found there. The com­
mission thought so well of the plan
that they have advertised for bids to
sink a much larger well on the same
land and expect to secure an ample
flow of water to supply the city's
needs up to the time when the popu­
lation will be 35,000 people. Two lines
of mains will be laid to the south hill
and a reservoir will be built with a
capacity of 3,000,000 gallons. The
two lines of main will guarantee that
the water will never be shut off, for
if one of the mains bursts, the other
will be available. The cost of the
proposed extension of the system will
be around $132,800. The water to be
furnished will 'be pure enough for
drinking purposes, and this in itself
will be a great saving to the people of
the city, who have to buy water for
drinking and cooking purposes under
the present plan.
The board of directors passed a res­
olution commending the city commis­
sion for their efforts to secure this
new water-supply, and expressed the
hope that the work would be continued
until the city was sure of sufficient
water for its needs for years to come.
A vote of thanks Was tendered Pres­
ident Shaw for coming before the
board and explaining the project.
President Shaw has set a new pace
in administering city affairs, for this
is the first time in many years that
the chief executive of the city ap­
peared before the directors of the As­
sociation of Commerce and discussed
city affairs. This is not new in cities
of the east, however, for in that sec­
tion of the country the commercial or­
ganizations and city administrations
work hand in hand for the betterment
of conditions in the cities. This is as
it should be, for it brings about per­
fect understanding, and much ^ood re­
sults.
REPORT ON CROP ROTATION
The 10th annual report of the North
Dakota Demonstration Farms is ready
for distribution. The crops are ro­
tated on these farms. The results in­
dicate that a rotation of crops pays.
The average wheat yield was 29 7-8
bushels. This wheat was in most
cases followed corn that had been ma­
nured. Oats, 58 1-2 bushels barley,
37 1-2 rye, 21 1-3 alfalfa hay, 2 6-8
tons per acre. The rotation practised
on each farm is given in the report, as
well as a detailed account of just how
each field was handled.

THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
Given as Prize in Palace of Machin­
ery at the Panama-Pacific
Exposition
Dodge Brothers have been notified
that the Dodge Brothers' Motor Car
has been awarded as a grand prize at
the Panama-Pacific Exposition to the
prize winning exhibitor in the Pal­
ace of Machinery.
The selection was made by a com­
mittee of 18 chosen by the Machin­
ery Exhibitors' association of the
Palace of Machinery. The commit­
tee was unanimous in its choice aft­
er an examination of all cars selling
at approximately the same price.
In making its announcement the
committee said:
"This decision was reached only
after a most careful consideration of
the merits of the many cars selling
at about the same price as the Dodge
Brothers' Motor Car, as well as the
financial standing and responsibility
of the manufacturers themselves."
The formal award took place in
the Palace of Machinery and there
was a big attendance.
The selection is particularly grat­
ifying to the Detroit manufacturers
because of the large field from which
the choice was made.
Minot Vocalist Will Sing at St. Paul.
Mrs. Henry Grimmer, pianist with
the Orpheum theatre orchestra and
one of Minot's most gifted vocalists,
has been engaged to appear on the
program at the Society of Equity con­
vention in St. Paul, Dec. 5, 6 and 7.
This is considered quite an honor, al
tho the recognition of her ability is
richly deserved. Both Mr. and Mrs.
Grimmer will leave for the Twin
Cities Monday and will enjoy a brief
vacation.

ROUGHING CATTLE THRU
THE WINTER DISCUSSED
With the present high price of all
concentrate feeds few farmers are
talking about grain feeding cattle
through the coming winter. Many,
however, are interested in wintering
a bunch of cattle on rough feeds in
the best manner possible.
"Roughing" cattle may mean either
one of two methods of handling them.
First it may mean carrying cattle
thru the winter without shelter and
allowing them to gain their livelihood
from straw stacks and what grass can
be found on the neighbors' farms or
it may mean simply caring for cattle
in a practical, economical and profit­
able manner without the use of grain.
Where cattle are roughed through the

Norway hall Saturday afternoon to
consider plans for enlarging the work
for the coming year.
UJkder the management of Peter
Miller, the business has grown to such
large proportions that plans were
made made for installing additional
equipment. An ice making plant and
a cold storage plant are to be added
and the butter and ice cream making
departments will be enlarged, provid­
ing for an enlarged output.
Additional stock was subscribed and
the affairs of the concern are in excel­
lent condition. The products of this
concern have won a high place among
northwestern products.
CRUCIFIED, DEAD AND
BURIED, AROSE AGAIN
Mrs. Orla Wherry, wife of the
freight conductor running through
Milnor, who is an ardent supporter
and admirer of Woodrow Wilson, was
made a target of considerable abuse
on election night by other women who
were supporting Hughes. Mrs. Wher­
ry was forced to take it all buc it was
a hard pill to swallow, not only that
Wilson seemed short of votes but the
terrible ridicule heaped upon her was
scorching. Three days later, when
Wilson's election was almost conced­
ed, she met her radical opponents on
the street. "How-do-you-do,"' she re­
marked. "I just want to quote you
some scripture. Listen: "He was cru­
cified, dead and buried, but on the
third day He arose again. Please al­
low this to soak in." The conversation

stantly in the company of officers and
was generally popular in the army
but other evidence has been presented
to show that soldiering is one of the
things the new emperor likes least.
He has been reported—with what
credibility is hard to say—as haying
seen "The Merry Widow" fifty times
in fifty days. He was until called
away by the critical condition of
Francis Joseph in nominal command
of the Teuton armies operating on the
Transylvania front of Roumania.
Aside from this, since the war be­
gan, Charles Francis has been under­
going a course of intensive training
for his prospective duties as emperor.
winter by the first method there will
usually be some loss of life and the
cattle will come ?ut in the spring
weighing less than they did in the fall
and it will take them half the summer
to get in a good healthy, thrifty con­
dition again. This method of rough­
ing cattle through the winter never
has .proved successful and never will.
The second method implies the use of
cheap shelter, which may be either
a straw shed or a board shed open on
one end, also the use of suitable rou^h
feeds, such as corn fodder, corn sil­
age,'millet hay, prairie hay, clover
or alfalfa hay, oat hay or oat straw.
In most localities this winter there is
an abundance of rough feed of one or
more of the above varieties.
For roughing cattle through the
^7*T pyijr «,« it .'7* 'i' ?W 'j&gfj'*

winter the best possible combination
of feeds is corn silage and alfalfa hay.
The difficulty is that as yet compar­
atively few farmers have learned this
fact and there are very few farms
where corn silage and alfalfa both
are to be found in sufficient quantity
to winter any large number of cattle.
Given a fairly roomy shed that is
kept well bedded with straw, a wat­
er tank with a heater in it with which
to remove the ice and take the chill
off the water, an abundance of alfalfa
hay and corn silage make an ideal
method of wintering a bunch of
yearling steers or heifers or a bunch
of breeding beef cows. On farms
where the silo has not yet been built
and the alfalfa field has not been
started the eorn can be used as fod­
der and prarie hay can be used along
with it and very good results secured
with these feeds.
In order that a beef herd may prove
profitable it is necessary that all the
young cattle shall gain a little in win­
ter and come out in the spring in a
good thrity condition so that they
will begin to gain at once when put
on pasture. To accomplish this and
get the desired result the young cat­
tle especially must have suitable
shelter though it need not be expen­
sive and they must be regularly and
carefully watered and regularly fed an
abundance of feed even though the
feed need not be of the best quality.—

ON JAP QUESTION
Great California Lecturer Appeared
Before Fortnightly Club at
Enjoyable Banquet
Montaville Flowers, the great Cali­
fornia reader, was the guest of honor
at an enjoyable banquet given at the
Minot-Normal school dining room on
Monday evening by the Fortnightly
club. Sixty members sat down at a
delightful feast and at its conclusion,
Mr. Flowers, who has made a compre­
hensive study of the Japanese ques­
tion, gave an address on this subject.
Mr. Flowers has lived for years in
California where the Japs are consid­
ered a menace to the white race. When
the Japs come in, the Americans sim­
ply have to go out. They are becom­
ing more numerous all the time and
until the California legislature passed
a law, prohibiting Japs to own land,
they were gobbling up the property at
an alarming rate. The Japanese prob­
lem will become the greatest of this
country's race problems, for the Japs
are backed up by one of the most pow­
erful government in the world. He
compared the Jap problem with the
negro question. Were our negroes
backed up by a powerful country like
Japan, think what a menace they
would be. The Japs are a more sub­
tle race than the Americans. They
look ahead a hundred years, while we
live only in the present. Then there is
China to consider, which country is
now dominated by the Japs. Those two
countries have a combined population
of 800,000,000, ten to one to our own
country.
Douglas Man Prosperous Trapper.
J. C. Henning, from near Douglas,
was in the city on business Saturday.
He reports a number in that vicinity
trapping either without licenses or the
proper kind of licenses. Mr. Henning
is operating 30 traps and gets on an
average about 40 muskrats a day. One
must skin the rats each day. Some
trappers have 1,000 rat hides already.
The hides are worth on the average
22 cents now but would be worth more
later in the season, could the trappers
only wait. Muskrats are very pro­
lific, the litters consisting of four and
five and the young ones are born
every few weeks. The female rats
are seldom trapped as they remain
away back in the bank of the sloughs.
Mr. Henning thinks skunks and minks
ought to be protected for a number of
years.
Nonpartisan Dues to be $8.00.
A Nonpartisan meeting was held
Saturday night at the Reinke school
house north of the city, which was
largely attended. A representative
from Fargo was present and gave a
financial report of the league, show­
ing how the money has been expend­
ed. The farmers are going to keep
their organization intact daxing the
i.ext two years at least, as was evi­
denced by the fact that practically
everyone attending the meeting sign­
ed up for the coming two years. The
dues are to be $8.00 per year in the
future.

TO HER REWARD
Beloved Minot Woman Passes Away
Following Short Illness—Burial at
Rose Hill Cemetery.
Mrs. Grace Andersen has gone to
her last reward. The deceased passed
away at St. Joseph's hospital at 2:30
o'clock Saturday morning following an
attack of uremic poisoning.
Mrs. Anderson, formerly Miss Grace
Shea, was borne in Boone township,
Porter county, Indiana, April 5, 1873,
being the first born to Mr. and Mrs.
J. A. Shea.
The parents moved to Kouts, Ind.,

Funeral services were held from the
M. E. church of Minot. The casket
was banked with beautiful flowers
which spoke plainly of the love and
esteem of those who will mourn her
departure.
The Rev. Mr. Pianette spoke a most
comforting sermon which will always
be remembered by those who heard his
words.
Besides her bereaved father she
leaves to mourn her departure a
heart-broken husband, a brother, L.
B. Shea, of Princeton, Minn., and a
host of friends.
The remains were interred in the
family lot in Rose Hill cemetery by
the side of her mother and sister,
Mrs. Lulu C. Caley.
Her mortal clay is laid to rest.
Her work on earth is o'er
She sleeps that sweet and peaceful

MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE
WERE FULLY*DISCUSSEI
Directors of the Association «.rf Com­
merce Have an Interesting
Session.
The board of directors of the asso­
ciation of commerce held a very in­
teresting and profitable meeting last
Tuesday afternoon at the offices of the
association.
Among other matters discussed
were the dates for the next Mid-win
ter Fair. The Northwestern North
Dakota Poultry association expressed
the desire to co-operate with the asso­
ciation in the matter of the next fair,
and requested that the last week in
February be set as the dates for the
event. After some discussion the
board decided to leave the matter
open until the next regular meeting
of the board, when the dates will be
set and committees appointed to look
after the details, as is usual.
The financial condition of the Asso­
ciation was found to be in excellent
condition, in that with the collections
that should come in before the first
of the year the organization v, ould be
entirely out of debt and perhaps have
a small surplus with which to start
the new year. Great care has been
exercised during the past year in ad­
ministering the finances of the associ­
ation, and yet a great amount of good
and permanent work has been accom­
plished.
Chairman Thompson of the commit­
tee looking into the matter of the
Soo Line Max cut-off, reported some
progress, and said that his commit­
tee would continue their efforts with
hopes of ultimate success.
The matter of continuing the As­
sociation of Commerce was brought
up informally, but it was decided that
a special meeting would be held in the
very near future to come to definite
conclusions regarding this important
matter. From the fact that, the As­
sociation has accomplished a great
deal of real good this year it is antic­
ipated that there will be no trouble in
perfecting the plans of the organiza­
tion for the next two or three years
quickly and satisfactorily.
•Upon request of the City Beautiful
League, Secretary Holbein was in­
structed to accept a position on the
executive committee of that organiza­
tion to represent the association in
the laudable work of the league.
A card received from Mr. and Mrs.
A. B. Hilliard states that they ar­
