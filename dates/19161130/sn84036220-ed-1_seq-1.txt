One of the Battles of the Present War Which Future Gen
erations Will Study Is the One Causing the Retreat
of the Rumanian Forces in Transylvania.
HERMANNSTADT, Transylvania,
Oct. 13.—(Correspondence of the As
sociated Press.)—One of the battles
of the present war which future gen
erations will study Is the one which
led to the complete rout and disor
ganization of the First Rumanian
army southeast of this city. For sev
eral reasons the buttle in question is
by fur the most interesting of the
European war. It caused the retreat
of the Rumanian forces which had
invaded Transylvania, and called for
a flunk maneuver whose success was
possible only with an enemy who
took too much for granted.
When General Falkenhayn's forces
reached the country north of Her
maunstadt, the general military situ
ation was not favorable for the cen
tral powers' troops. The invading
i.uuiauiaii troops had occupied good
positions and had the advantage of
numerical superiority. Kronstadt
and the country north of that city
had been occupied. The entire val
ley of the Alt was in the hands of the
Rumanians, and the Germans and Aus
tro-Hungarian troops depended for
transportation upon a few single
tracked railroads of little strategic
vai'ie.
Gradually contact was established
wan the enemy by advancing the
central forces' right wing. The Vul
can pass was taken. This done, the
Teutonic army pressed slowly for
ward along the Transylvanian Alps,
.'riving the Rumanians before them.
Tlie intention of the Rumanian gener
al staff to push as far west as the
Theiss river was wrecked.
net maunstadt had not been occu
pied by the Rumanians, a failure due
to lack of Initiative. The city could
have been taken without much fight
ing, but already the Rumanians had
been given several good examples of
Falkenhayn's strategy. ^The Ruman
ians lay south of the city in a half
circle, refrained from offensive ma
neuvers, and so gave Falkenhayn the
very opportunity he needed to set his
great drive in motion. Slowly the
imperial troops were advanced to
wards the hills north of the Alt, while
against the Ghost forest in the east
central cavalry was thrown to protect
the left flank.
This was the situation on September
23.
The Rumanians had the Red Tower
pass in their rear, and a frontal at
tack might do no more than throw
them upon this. It was necessary to
close the pass. This could be done
only by sending troops through the
mountains west of the pass, a very
difficult maneuver, since the moun
tains have no roads of any sort. Ar
tillery and supply trains were out of
the question.
General Falkenhayn decided to at
tempt the flank movement with some
German alpine troops, of which Ba
varian mountaineers were but a small
contingent, many of the ''alpine" sol
diers being in reality natives of Meck
lenburg, men who in all their lives
had never climbed a mountain.
Three battalions set out. The men
carried food for four days and their
regular issue of ammunition. Re
serve supplies were carried on a hasti
ly organized pack train. Through the
foothills of the mountains a road .
could be used, then paths were fob |
lowed, and finally the crests near the
Rumanian border had to be gained
through dense forests and Across
boulder fields. |
An odd feature of the maneuver 1
was that the contact established with
the Rumanian border guards did not
result in the commander of the first
Rumaniun army taking some precau
tionary measure for the protection of
his flank. The German flankers had
dally skirmishes with the Rumanian
border troops, but never met serious
opposition.
Tlie flanking force was to reach the
Red Tower pass on Sept. 26, on which
day a frontal attack was to be made
from the direction of Hermannstadt.
Despite great hardships and the aban
donment at the village of Dus of the
pack train, the Germans succeeded in
reaching the heights above the Alt
defile on the morning of the twenty
sixth. Some engineers descended into
tlie gorge and blew up the road at
two points where revetments made
this feasible. Even then the Ruman
ians seem to have felt absolutely se
cure. The fact that in their rear an
enemy was destroying their one di
rect line of communication does not
seem to have troubled them much.
Probably the thought that the road
through tlie Alt valley and to Kron
stadt was open may be responsible
for this.
The original program had called for
a general attack at 1 o'clock in the
morning of the twenty-sixth. The
flanking troops were in telephonic
connection witli headquarters, and so
learned that the attack from Hermann
stadt had been postponed. The sit
uation of the Alpine troops was far
from reassuring. A movement on their
own flank might be undertaken by the
Rumanians at any hour. The twenty
sixth passed. The flanking body had
been divided into three columns, us
the pass was approached. The one
advancing close to the Rumanian bor
der reached the pass close to Riul
Vatului, the Rumanian border point.
The central column neared the gorge
three miles above, while the third
body squeezed itself through between
the Rumanians at Herannstadt and
the central range.

GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS MADE
A LIBERAL RESPONSE.

anything but the practical foodstuff
that will tide a family over quite a
spell. It is stated by these gentle
men that the response to the editorial
in the Democrat-News of some days
ago was most hearty and generous
and many boxes of apples, sacks of
potatoes, and best of all, a large quan
tity of flour was given the bureau
of charities tor distribution. The
school children have turned in con
siderable in small donations of money,
as well as Borne groceries that will
give good cheer to many a dinner to
morrow.
It is well for the people of the city
who have means to know that there
is quite a demand on the Associated
Charities of the Chamber of Com
jnerce, and on the Salvation Army
these days, and any assistance in the
way of clothing, groceries, of a staple
nature and, best of all, money, to use
in purchasing shoes and needed un
derclothing, will be accepted by either
institution and accounted for in the
yearly reports.
Union Thanksgiving services will be
held at the Presbyterian church at
10:30 today, the congregations of the
Methodist, Baptist, Christian, Presby
terian and Zion Lutheran churches
uniting. The sermon will be deliv

VILLA TAKES PART OF CAPITAL
EL PASO, Tex., Nov. 29.—The first
foreign refugee to leave Chihuahua
City since the siege began arrived
here today. He reported that Villa
and Julio Acosta were in control of
part of the city when he made his
escape by automobile at 2 o'clock this
morning. Owing to the fact that
he had been in close hiding, be ex
plained that he had no means of know
ing first hand just what had hap
pened or even the whereabouts of
General Trevino.
Carranza forces were holding hard
to their part of the city, according to
the refugee, who added that he under
stood all foreigners were safe, at least
to the extent of -Jeaving the area
through which Villa fought his way.

DAT:NEIL RUSH ON ALL DAT YESTERDAY
County Treasurer Rufus Poland and
liis assistants put in a very busy day
yesterday receiving taxes, many sup
posing Hint it was tlie last cliunee for

FARMERS SHQULD°BE ON LOOKOUT
FOR A HORSE BUYING STRANGER
Chief StocK inspector Frank ini
vigne came in last evening from the
eastern part of the state where he
had been on official business. He
lias been looking into a case coming
up recently at Poplar, uml which is
| explained in (lie following dispatch
sent out yesterday from that place:
! "Sheridan county authorities have
issued a warning to farmers, ranch
ers and bankers to beware of one F.
H. Smith, posing as a horse buyer for
a Dig Chicago livestock company.
They declare they have evidence to
show that tlie man is an .imposter, as
tlie firm lie claims to be connected
with say they do not know him.
"At Poplar, Smith drew two drafts,
one for $25,000 and another for $20,
000, on tlie Drexel State hank of Chi
cago. hut tlie Chicago bank says that
Smith is unknown to them. Several
other checks which were given in pay
ment of bills came back with payment
refused.
"According to (lie report. Smith
started in to buy horses on a big scale.
He bargained for several large strings
ami branded one bunch of them. The
theory advanced is that Smith figured
to get a big hunch of horses together,
load them quickly and by making a
quick sale, beat the game before lie
was discovered.
"He has been gone for some time
now and with every evidence that he
is gone for good. Farmers in other
sections are warned to be on the look
out for the horse-buying stranger."

Russians Start an Intense Offensive in Carpathian Region,
Near the Rumanian Border, Probably as a Diversion,
But the Teutons March on Toward Capital.
ALTHOUGH WOUND INFLICTED BY
COLONEL SHOMO SUNDAY
MORNING VERY SERIOUS.
WHAT THE DIFFICULTY AROSE OVER
Harley H. Sliowen, who was out In
the abdomen at an early hour on Sun
day morning hy Col. Charles W.
Shotuo, proprietor of the Judith room
ing house, was resting well last night,
with every prospect of recovery, al
though Dr. Attix, the attending pity
slclan, found upon examination
I lull tho blade lutd cut the In
testlnes, making tlie wound consid
orahly more serious Hum was at llrsl
thought. Hr. Attix says that, except
for coinplicutioiiH, which are always
possible in a wound of litis nature,
Mr. Sliowen will pull through nicely.
Colonel Sliotno was placed under
arrest shortly after tho affray uml
later was released upon bonds.
Shomo's Statement.
Colonel Sliotno, in a statement early
Sunday morning as to tlie affair and
the cause leading up to It, said that
lie had derided to take over the rooms
that had been occupied by Mr. Sliowen,
on the top floor of the Judith, for
some six months and use them for
transient business. Tills was com
municated to Mr. Sliowen through an
other party, and Mr. Sliowen then de
cided that lie would retain the rooms
as an apartment for light housekeep
ing. This was not satisfactory to Mr.
Sliotno, however, and the fact was
made known to Mr. Sliowen, also
through another party. Saturday
night, Mr. Sliotno says, after lie
learned that lie could not retain tho
rooms, as lie proposed, Mr. Sliowen
met Mrs. Slionio on the second tloor,
and apparently, blunting her for the
refusal lo permit him to retain the
rooms, abused her, railing her some
names, and also licensing her of liav
lug "knocked" Dim for months. Mrs.
Slionio, according to Imr husband, was

ing Sliowen, he says, closed witli him
and was engaged in hitting him when,
as Sliotno put it, lie found lie "had
to defend himself tlie best way lie
could." lie did not specifically state
that lie cut Sliowen, hut, of course, It
was tlien that tlie rutting took place.
Slionio Hays he found that Sliowen wuh
a very powerful man and lie could not

As soon as he was cut, the men part
eil and Sliowen went up lo tlie Crow
ley block, where he aroused some
friends, lie was quickly taken to tlie
room of u friend in the Waldorf while
Dr. Attix was called, and later had
Sliowen taken to tlie hospital.
Immediately after the cutting,
Sliotno left the building, simply to
get away until the excitement was
over, as he explained. He returned a
few minutes later, and liiH statement
us to tlie affair wns made in the pres
ence of Officers Clyde Nelson and
Paul Diggers. Mrs. Sliotno corrobor

the decision to take Ills rooms. Site
stated that her husband cut Sliowen
because lie had to protect himself.
Mr. Sliowen had no idea as to just
how seriously In* had been injured im
mediately after he found lie had been
stabbed, but wus perfectly calm and
collected, and before being taken to
tlie hospital chatted with tlie half
dozen friends who were with him.
Mr. Showen's father has arrived
here and is now with him and he is,
of course, receiving every possible
rare and attention.
Assistant County Attorney Raymond
Dockery took the matter up yester
day by causing the arrest of Col.

with the bond fixed at $2,500.

ASSOCIATED PRESS RESUME.
Although the Russians, probably as
a diversion, have started and ure car
rying on witli great intensity an of
fensive in the Carpathian region
around Klrlihaba, northwest of tho
Rumanian border, the advance of tlie
Teutonic allies all ulong the line ill
Wallacliiii toward the Runuiuiaii capi
tal of Itiicliarest apparently Is meet
ing witli little impediment. The left
Hank of tlie forces of (lie central pow
ers have now captured tlie important
railroad Junction of Petechtl, 65 miles
northwest of Itiicliarest; In tlie cen
ter the Riitnitnians ure reported to be
retreating eastward in disorder, while
the right Hank, composed of tlie unity
of Field Marshal von Mackensen,
which crossed Hie Danube, is carrying
out maneuvers in cooperation with tlie
oilier commanders of the north.
The I'elrogrud war office, In admit

men operating from Alexandria tiave
advanced along tlie Turnpec road to
KitUigureim, the latter town |hein£
211 miles southwest of Bucharest. Tur
kish troops are lighting with tlie Ger
mans and Austrians In this region.
The Russian nfficiul communication
asserts that the Russian attack east
and south of Klrllbaha has resulted
in (lie rupture of ridges and tho taking
of 76« men prisoners. Tho Berlin war
office admits that slight gains were
made Imt says the Russians suffered
heavy casualties.
Apparently litile infantry fighting
lias taken place on nny of the other
fronts. On the line in France and
B. Igiuni there have been artillery
duels at various points uml here and
there small attacks hy raiding parties
of both the belligerents. Similar
lighting is taking place on the Rus
sian front.
The latest German official rommunl
ration says quiet prevails on the Mace
donia front, there having been no re
sumption of the great battle of tho
early week in which both the Teu

LONDON. Nov. 29.—(10:60 p. m.)—
Under the defense-of-the-reaim act, the
Board of Trade announces that from
December 1 it will assume control of
all the c(sil mines in South Wales. A
committee has been appointed, rep
resenting the Board of Trade, the
home office and the admiralty, for
the administration of the mines and
will meet tomorrow to consider the
question of wages.
SERIOUS 8ITUATION.
LONDON. Nov. 30.—(4:23 a. m.j—
The rapid advance of the Germans
in Rumania with the capture of
Petechtl and tlie approach to the Kul
itgurena from Giurgiu is regarded here
as constituting u serious situation,
judging rrom comment in the morning
papers. It is remarked that if the
invaders reach Kulugurena they will
he only seventeen miles from. Buchar
est and only fourteen miles from the
outer forts of the capital.
The military correspondent of the
TimeR, however, sees cause for hope.
Tlie correspondent attaches impor
tame to the Russian attack on the
northern passes which he thinks prob
ably surprised the Germans.
Tlie success of a Russian counter
offensive on this front Is largely de
pendent, he says, upon the efforts of
tlie Rumanians further south and it
is to be assumed that the Russians
were satisfied in this respect before
launching their attacks.
