, War Prices for Food.
New York World.
.. The American people are pay
ing war prices for food and near-
, ly everything else. That is their
contribution to the cost of the
: most devastating war known to
history.
Tbey will continue to pay un
til the war has ended and the
work of reconstruction is well un
der way.
The economic rsults of this war
cannot be localized. It is impos
sible to take forty million men
out of productive industry and
put them into destructive indus
try without exacting tribute from
the whole world.
In the belligerent countries the
iuflation of food prices can be
" regulated by the militaiy power
of government. Germany long
ago directed a food directorship.
Great Britain and France are
. now following the German exara-
pie. Even with complete and un-
challenged command of the sea
and all the markets of the world
open to them, them, the British
and French governments have
been compelled to take over the
regulation of food supplies and
food prices in the interest of mil
itary efficiency and national safety-
With a short crop the United
States is trying to feed half of
the belligemnts as well as many
European neutrals. That makes
high prices for farmers, huge
profits for speculators and the
big middle men, but it is a hea
vy burden upon the great mass
. of wage-earners and salaried em
ployes., la spite of an unpreceden
ted prosperity, they have increa
sing difficulty to make both ends
meet, and this is augmented by
every tradesman whose greed has
throttled his conscince.
During the recent campaign
Mr. Hughes was fond of saying
that the American people were
living in a fool's paradise. That
is true; but it is not the kind of
fool's paradise that Mr. Hughes
thought they were living in. He
had no remedy except a restora
tion of extortionate tariff sched
ules which could only result in
making a bad matter worse. His
scheme for establishing prosperi
ty was to inflate prices still fur
ther, make the cost of living still
higher and the difficulties more
acute.
No remedy "for this situatiDn
can be improvised by anybody.
This country is actually on a
war basis so far as food is con
cerned, yet there are no means or
agencies, by which the question
can be t reated as a war question.
A movement in behalf of an em
bargo on food exports was star
ted daring the campaign aud re
ceived much support from the
pro-Uerman elements that had
previously advocated an embar
go on munitions; but an embar
go is a two-edged sword. Nobody
can foresee the ultimate conse
quences bf its use, and it is to be
adopted only as a last desperate
resort.
Before the American people be
gin to talk about embargoes they
must first exhaust all establish
ed intthods of obtaining relief.
There is city, state and national
' machinery that can deal with
trade extortions and conspria
cies if that ' machinery is forced
into use by the pressure of public
opinion. Every, family has in it
self certain means of relief, one of
which is to practice a reasonable
economy. We are the most ex
travagant and wasteful people
in. the world, and while extrava
gance and waste are not necessa
rily dangerous in time of plenty,
, they become a public menace in
' etn economic crisis.
As a nation we are flying too
high and cannot indefinitely keep
up the pace that we have set for
PATTERSON SCHOOL WAS HARDEST HIT.
It Friend of the Mountain Boys Looks
Looks Over Wreck anil De
scribes Scene. -
Mr. J. A. Robinson, of Dur
ham, writing in The Lenoir News
on the Patterson School at Leg
erwood, N. C, tells of the destruc
tion wrought by the recent flood:
"The Yadkin valley, the ' "hap
py valley,' "he says, was hit hard
by the July floods, freshets, wa
terfalls and waters, and the good
people down here feel its effects to
a far-reaching degree. Much val
uable bottom land has been de
stroyed by sand bars, and the
bottom of the river being literal
ly dumped out over on some of
the level stretches. Much of the
lowland crops were washed away.
At first it looked as if the des
truction was complete. Hope
sank deep in the human breast
and flickered low. The deluge
swept away material things.
Stout, warm hearts were left to
refresh their courage in their ex
perience of the past, and rekindle
their energy with the returning
of another spring and planting
time. The birds are singing down
the valley right now, in their
merriest mood adding their sweet
songs to the cheer of returning
hope and determination, and
stronger faith in an All-wise Fa
ther. The Patterson school farm suf
fered along with its neighbors;
perhaps not as much as some of
them. It could have been worse
with all, but there are many
hearts that are thankful that it
was no worse than it was. It was
a materially hard hit to the farm
however, and will take some time
time to recover from some of the
effects. The washing of the Buffa
lo mill dam not once, buttwice,
for after the dam went it was re
built by the boys, and the sec
ond dam went the way of the
first. This stopped all grinding on
the farm, which is a very great
inconvenience.
"The material loss to the farm
is estimated atabout$l,500. aud
this is principally in the widen
ing of the river, in some places
being washed and gullied amost
beyond remedy. In other places
sand and rock were piled up to a
considerable depth. From ten to
fifteen acres of the best bottom
land is thus washed and sauded.
A great deal of corn was much
damaged. The white potatoes
fared a similar fate, but not to
such an extent as the corn. It is
estimated that the loss to the
crops on the Patterson school
farm will amount to three-fourths
of what was expected. All of this
is hard on the working of t h e
ourselves. Economy may be irk
some, but economy is imperative
if price-inflation is to be checked.
The American people cannot sit
placidly by and wait for govern
ment to provide an abundance of
cheapfood. They must help them
selves while government is help
ing them, and the first thing they
must understand is that every
country is directly or indirectly
concerned in this war. Every
body is helping to pay for the
lives, that are wasted, for the
property that is destroyed and
for the productive industries that
are smothered while the devasta
tion goes on.
We think we am out of t h e
war, but we too are in it, altho'
we are not sending troops to the
trenches, we are temporarily in
much the 6ame condition as the
non-combatent population of the
fightiug nations, and must sub
mit to many of the same hard
ships. Until we learn that, we
shall not make much progress in
dealing with food suppliej and
food prices.

Charles E. Hugber, Republican
candidate for President in the re
cent election, Wednesday night
sent to President Wilson a tele
gram congratulating him upon
his re-election. In his telegram
Mr. Hughes said:
"Because of the closeness of
the vote 1 have awaited the offi
cial count in California and now
that it has been virtually com
pleted, permit me to extend to
you my congratulations upon
your re-election. I desire also to
express my best wishes for a suc
cessful administration."
The President replied as fol
lows: "I am sincerely obliged to you
for your message of congratula
tion. Allow me to assure you of
my good wishes for the years to
come.

ing a matter over which the man

The Mountain Railroads.
Charlotte Observer.
Last Spring, when the peniten
tiary board withdrew the con
victs from the railroad work in
the mountain nection and hired
them out as day laborers, it
promised that this labor should
be restored to the ra ilroads with
the coming of the New Year. It
seems that the board is true to
its word. At least this is to be the
case with the Elkin & Alleghuny
Company, which has received no
tice that the convicts will be re
turned on January 1. We sup
pose the same ruling will apply
to the other railroads, and more
especially to the Statesville Air
Line and the Watauga &. Yad
kin River. The Statesville road
has fared discouragingly in the
matter of State aid, and it is a
road, the complication of which
is a consummation of large com
mercial importance to Charlotte.
The Elkin & Alleghany has reach
ed within 1G miles of Sparta in
Alleghany county, and is now
well graded towards the top of
the Blue Ridge. The difficulty
surmounted, the two counties of
Alleghany and Ashe, that have
been cut off from commercial and
social intercourse with their own
State, will be brought into part
nership with their native Com
monwealth. Our own counties
and our own people, Virginiaand
Tennessee have had commercial
control of them almost absolute
ly. They are two of the richest
counties in the entire range of
the Appalachians and their
wealth has been diverted all these
years to the enrichment of t h e
two states named. The Observer
has contended that it is the duty
of North Carolina to bring this
garden spot of the mountains
within her own borders and the
completion of the Elkin & Alle
ghany Railroad will accomplish
the desired end.
The Observer's policy for the
development of the rich moun
tain resurces of the State has in
cluded the advocacy of State aid
for all of the mountain roads
We shall take occasion to renew
the contention that the State
should not lend' this aid in drib
lets, as it has been nigardly do
ing in the past, but place it at
the disposal of the builders of
these roads all lie available con
vict aid, to the'end that all these
Tines may be accomplished with
out unnecessary delay. The con
vict forces could bo put to no
more valuable employment.
These railroads, intermittently
assisted by the State with a mea
ger force of laborers, have made
steady, if discouraging progress
If it is right for the State to aid
them in a small way, is it right
for this aid to be extended in a
wholesale mannnr to the end
that the work may be ot speedy
accomplishment, after which the
convicts may be hired out or dis
posed of in whatever manner
may seem most advisable and
profitable. It is the State itself
that will be the greatest gainer
by the building of these moun
tain roads. It stands to reason,
therefore, that the most profita
ble employment it could find for
convicts is in the construction of
these great developments factors
the railroads that will bring
thesese wester counties within
our borders. The sooner the
work is completed, the sooner
will the State begin reaping the
benefits.

The report that Judge Boyd
would retire would retire from
the bench having reached the
age of 70 he can retire on full
pay was again in circulation
this week, the report being sent
from Washington to the Greens'
boro News.
The judge has entered denial
and again dashed the hopes of
asyiring Democrats. He says he
wouldn't consider it lioness "to
take advantage of the govern
ment by enjoying in idleness a
salary which I felt fully capable
of earning by service rendered. I
should not consider it an honor
able thing to do, and nothing is
further from ray intentions."
