The Thanksgiving concert giv
en last Sunday evening at the
Presbyterian church was both
uplifting and educational. A
special Thanksgiving sermon
was delivered by the pastor, Dr.
Lvtle, in which his choir very
materially assisted with suitable
anthems: An appreciative con
gregation listened with much at
tention and departed feeling the
better for having been present.
The Standard Oil Company
will shortly erect a building near
the present location of their
tanks, to be used as an office. Mr.
Lawrence Stanley now has
charge of the company's inter
ests at this point. "'
Withdrawal of Troops
Atlantic, N. J., Nov. 24. An
agreement was reached between
the American and Mexican dele
gates of the joint conference late
today. It provides:
No. 1. For the withdrawal
from Mexico of the Pershing ex
pedition within forty days of the
approval by both governments
of the agreement. The provision
is made that the time may be ex
tended if conditions in northern
Mexico are such as to constitute
a menace to United States soil.
The details of the withdrawal
are left to General Pershing.
. No. 2. That United States
troops shall thereafter patrol I
their side of the border and the
Mexican troops theirs in order to
guard against raids, co-operation
between both forces in case
of necessity is provided.
The "agreement was reached
after thirteen weeks of delibera
tion. The question of a loan was
not brought up.
The agreement is contingent
on the approval of General Car
ranza, and this is likely to hinge
upon his attitude toward the
clause providing for the pursuit
into Mexico of Mexican , bandits
raiding American border towns.
President Wilson has already
sanctioned its terms.
A copy of the agreement will
be taken to Mexico by Albert
Pani, who left for New York this
evening and will probably be in
conference with General Carran
za by Saturday of next week.
The convention will reconvene

THE PRESIDENT'S THANKSGIVING DAY
PROCLAMATION.
It has long been the custom of ou- people to turn
in the fruitful autumn of the year in praise and
thanksgiving to the Almighty God for bis many
. blessings and mercies to us and the nation
The year that has elapsed since we last observ
ed our day of Thanksgivirg has been rich in bless
ings to us a people but the whole face of the world
has been darkened by war. In the midst of our
peace and happiness, our thoughts dwell with pain,
ful disquiet upon the struggels and sufferings of
the nations at war and of the peoples upon whom
war has brought disaster without choice or possibity
of escape cri their part. We cannot think of our
own happiness without thinking of their pitiful
distress.
Now, therefore, I, Wood row Wilson, President
of the United States of America, do appoint Thurs
day,, the 30th of November, as a day of national
Thanksgiving and prayer, and urge and advise the
people to resort to their several places of worship
(n that day, to render thanks to Almighty God for
. the ' blessings of peace and unbroken prosperity
which He has bestowed upon our beloved country in
such unstinted measure. ,
I also urge and suggest our duty in this our day
of peace and abundance, to think in deep sympathy
of the stricken peoples of the world upon whom the
curse and terror of war has so pitilessly fallen, and
to contribute out of our abundant means to the relief
of their sufferings. , -
Our peoplecould in no better way show their
real attitude toward the present struggle of the
nations than by contributing- out of their abundance
to the relief of the suffering which war has brought
in its train.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand
and caused the seal of the Umtd States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 17th day of
. November, in the year of Our I.,ord, 1916, and of the
Independence of the United States the Hist.

THE FIRST THANKSGIVING
PROCLAMATION
Therefore, I, William Bradford,
Governor of Plymouth, say, , -Through
virtue of vested power:
Ye shall gather with one accord,
And hold in the month of November,
Thanksgivintr'unto the Lord.
WILLIAM BRADFORD,
Governor of Plymouth, 1621.
A little moisture at this time
would be especially welcomed by
those who have out a large acre
age of wheat. This, however, is
not to be taken as any indication
that next year's crop is going to
be a failure. The wheat is in no
way suffering, but a little mois
ture always helps.
Cement work on the basement
of the Willis Wolfe garage on
west Carthage avenue is com
pleted and work on the main
building will shortly begin. Mr.
Wolfe expects to have one of the
best equipped garages in the
west, with an abundance of room
for storing cars.
" Over 112,000 Tags
Because more money is ac
cumulating in the state automo
bile tax fund, as the . state's
share, than the state needs for
defraying expenses, of the auto
mobile tag department, the leg
islature will be asked to change
the, law, so part of the surplus
can be turned back, pro rata to
the counties.
"I know that the recommen
dation will be made," C. E. Bot
kin, an official of the state auto
mobile tax department, who was
here today, said. "Seventy thou
sand dollars surplus has beer
turned into the general fund. It
will be recommended that this
money be paid back to the counties."
According to Mr. Botkin the
state has issued 112,137 automo
bile tags since the first of July,
This is 23,000 more than during
the whole of the previous year,
and this fiscal year is less than
half gone. It indicates that there
is a very big increase in the
number of automobiles in Kan
sas. .
Mr. Botkin was here on an in
spection trip which he is making
over the state. He occasionally
spots cars, on these trips, that
do not have tags, and these are
turned in to the authorities.
"Generally speaking, the state
law is being respected," said Mr.
Botkin. "But we find a few vio
lators here and there." Hutch

Land Office to Topeka
Washington, Nov. 25. One
of the changes to be expected in
the near future is the consolida
tion of the two United States
land offices in Kansas into one
office at Topeka. This is in line
with the policy of the govern
ment, in the interest of econrihiy.
When the consolidations are
made under the present plan the
state capital is chosen as the
' more appropriate place.
I . The removal of the ' records
now at Dodge City to Topeka.
when accomplished, will place all
public land records of Kansas in
one place. Former consolida
tions have placed in the Topeka
office the records of the old agen
cies at Wichita, Independence,
Humboldt, Kirwin, Salina, Con
pordia, 'Colby, Wakeeney, Ozaw
kie, Lecompton, Augusta and
i Pleasanton.
! With the taking up of public
lands there is not now sufficient
business to maintain .two offices
in the state. The offices in Okla
homa were consolidated; some
time aeo. and other states have
been undergoing similar consoli
dations for some yeai;s.

Word from Wichita, states
that Frank Wehrle pf this city,
who has been in the hospital at
that place for the past month, is
somewhat improved.
Gratitude in Sorrow
Thanksgiving seasou
comes at "the dying of the
year", when frost has strick
en flowerand .tree and the
land is preparing for a win
,ter of bleakness and cold;
but the year's harvest is in,
and the barns are full. Tho
dreariness and storm may
appear at any hour, there is
gratitude to God for his ,
gifts. So even in presenee
of impending - sorrow, we
praise God. Ex.
More Than 113,000,000
Washington, Nov. 24. On
January, 1917, the United States
will have a "population of 113,
309,285. The bureau of the census to
day made this estimate based
upon the federal census of 1910
and 1900.
, John Madden, a , well known
Kansas attorney, will soon re
move from Parsons to Wichita,
where, with his son and son-in-law,
he will open a law office. Mr.

attorney for the M. K. & T. rail
way company, which position he
held until two years ago. He is
a brother of Judge Dennis Mad

Montezuma to Incorporate
Montezuma, Kaii Nov. 26.
Petitions are being circulated
and liberally signed asking the
county commissioners to take
necessary action that Monte
zuma may become an incorpor
ated city of the third class.
There are something like 250
people living here now and 200
is all that is needed for incorpor
ation. Montezuma will be the
only incorporated city between
Dodge City and Hugoton when
this action is taken.

Cars Ordered Returned
Washington, Nov( 24. All
railroads of the country today
received instructions from the
American Railway association to
return all open top cars to their
owners at once, irrespective of

association's committee on car
efficiency in an effort to relieve
the shortage of coal cars.
The first floor of the Masonic
building is being. remodeled and
re-decorated and will in the fu

Should Meet Frequently
There should be a farmers' im
provement club in each neigh
borhood a club that is broad in
its scope and purpose. This club
should hold - regular meetings,
with music, and recitations by
the young folks, and there
should be talks by farmers on
live topics and papers and gen
eral discussions and debates on
farm questions. And it 'might
be well to include an old-time
spelling match now and then
to play some of the old.:' time
games folks used to play. And,
the men who run the stores
should have an improvement
club in town. They should meet
together to discuss business
questions, that we may have bet
ter clerks, that useless waste
may be eliminated, that we may
have better stores and better
prices, and better service to the
buyer. And the farmer, in work
ing out the problems of the farm
should have the co-operation,
the sympathy and the friend
ship of the merchant; and the
merchant, in working out the
problems of the store, should
have the co-operation, the sym
pathy and the friendship of the
farmer. And then, back of the
farmer's improvement club, and
back of the merchant's improve
ment club there should be a gen
eral community club, composed
of all the business men of the
locality, both town and country.
And this community club should
meet frequently for the consid
eration of community entertain
ments in the winter should
support a community chorus
should see that the town band is
given proper encouragement,
and should get behind every
good thing that might add to the
social life of the people. In the
summer there should be com
munity picnics and base ball
games and fairs and frolics and
fun for everybody. " Communi
ty betterment does not mean
just keeping the money at home
it means making country life
so pleasant that all the young
folks will want to stay at home.
