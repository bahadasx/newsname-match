Grimm, planned and carried out

prise for their father.
Twenty-four guests wereinvited in

During the evening delicious re
freshments were served. We are
not saying how many birthdays
Mr. Grimm has enjoyed but we are
sure that this one will never be
forgotten.
Automobile Accident
The Tuesday St. Louis Republic
gives an account of an auto ac
cident in which Dr. Rush Turner
participated. The car with four cc
cupants was near O'Fallon when
the accident occured. The men
had been hunting and were enroute
home. The roud was narrow and
the car skidded down an embank
ment. One man jumped and was
instantly killed. The driver was
injured. Dr. Turner was thrown
from the car. His father, Dr. George
Turner, had heard nothing more
than the paper stated, when we
went to press yesterday.

Good Bye
To all things in this world there
comes a time to say "Good Bye."
As editor of the Monroe City Dem
ocrat that time has come to us
now. For more than twenty-two
years we have been Editor of this
paper. During that time ve have
greatly enjoyed recording good
things of the people and the im
provements of the community
There has also been a sad side of
the question. It has been necessary
to write some things which made
us sad.
We have ever booster for what
we thought was for the best in
terests of the community, regard
less of whether the idea was ours
or of some one else. Of course we
have not always advocated that
which all of you have endorsed,
but we were sincere and we gave
you the same right to your opinion.
We have tried to do all the good
we could for the community. Like
all others of humanity we have
many times failed. All that can
be expected of each of us is that
we do our duty as we see it.
At this time we desire to thank
the citizens of Monroe City and
vicinity for their liberal patronage
of the Democrat The more they
have done for us, the more we have
been able to do for the community.
We believe that if the people
were brought to realize how much
good a newspaper does for a
community, they would give a
greater patronage, because there is
no agency that can or will do as
much for any community as a
prosperous newspaper.
Herman W. Bell assumes the
responsible position of Editor and
Publisher of the Democrat. He is
a live young man experienced in
the newspaper work and we believe
will always be found boosting for
Monroe City and vicinity. We ask
for him the same splendid patron
age which you have given us. 11
you dont like his paper, tell him.
Aid him in every way and he will
do great good for the community.
He alone is responsible for what
may appear in the Democrat and
day? Have
