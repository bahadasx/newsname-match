NEGRO ADOPTS PUN
FO l RIDE AiD Ri L il
As a Result He will Likely
Get Long Jail or Pen'
Sentence
Leonard Jderson, a negro re
siding near Angle, confessed to
aiuthrities Satuday that he placed
the steel ail across the N.00,.N,
tracks and then flagged the train
two miles this side of Varnado last
Friday night nad his confession
solves the mvstery of the attempted
act of wrecking the north bound
passenger train. When Jefferson
saw the blood hounds and the
officers he soon made the confee
son. He stated that his reapons
for laying the rail across the track
were that he wanted to get
a ride to Angie and possibly that
the railroad would give him a
reward for his discovery.
The rail was 33 feet long and
weighed 80 lbs. to the yard and
was laved across the track in such
a manner that it would have de
railed the engine and possibly all
the coaches and resulted in several
deaths had Jefferson not remained
to flathe train. He was brought
to this city and paced in jail
charged with obstructing a train
with the intention of wrecklg
same. The amouna of the bond has
not beenaplced but it will be very

Bogalusa a mosquitoless city. Fol
lowing their report the citizens will
be asked to coolprate and by this

The fact that'there re considerable more chldrea living

buy more useful gifts meanshat theoommittee will need more
money. It is the intention of the Finance Committee to call

donation will b~.all the more appreciated if you show interest
enough to' send the amount you see fit to give to C. L. Jobbh
