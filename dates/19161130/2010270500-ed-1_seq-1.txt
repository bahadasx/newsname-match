Sioux City Journal, 27: When
Mrs. C. R. Carter, of South Sioux
City, yesterday morning went to the
crib of her 7-month-old baby, John
Henry Carter, to arouse the infant
from slumber, she found him dead.
Examination revealed that death
was caused by suffocation. Illness
ad weakened the child and probab
. contributed to the death, phy
nicirt.is said. Mr. and Mrs. Carter
have lived in South Sioux City for two
months. The baby was their only

ens received 28,055, W. P. Warner

ty put F. F. Haase across all right.
He only had a majority of 340 in
Dixon and Dakota counties, and
Conley had 3G2 in his home county of
Thurston, which gave Conley a ma
jority of 22. Burt came in with 355
for Haase which elected him with a
total majority of 333.
Bloomficld Monitor: U. S. Mar
shal Morgan, who came up here a
week or two ago and carted off two
alleged bootleggers to Omaha, came
back on Tuesday this week and went
away Wednesday morning with two
more on the same charge. He says
he is coming back soon after some
more of those frisky gentlemen who
are furnishing the Indians their high
ly coyeted "fire water." Mr. Mor
gan is certainly doing a good job.
We can still spare a few more of our
greatly undesirable citizens.
LeMars, la., Sentinal: The dis
trict court of Dakota county, Neb.,
opened yesterday. One case for
trial is of interest to LeMars people.
John Peyson was a notorious charac
ter for many years. He lived in Le
Mars in the early eighties and was
deputy sheriff in Plymouth county
for a brief time. He later engaged
in the saloon business in Covington,
Neb., where he gained unsavory no
toriety, and also at one time con
ducted a saloon in LeMars. His easi
ly obtained money did him no good
and after the dry wave came he was
stranded and finally went to the
poor house.
Homer Star: Newton Purdy, old
time Dakota county resident, died
in Oklahoma City, November 7th.
Mr. Purdy was born in Harden
county, Ohio June 18, 1847, and was
married December 24, 1867, to Mary
Alexander. He came to Dakota
county at an early day and after a
few years moved to Oklahoma where
he resided for the past 27 years.
Mr. Purdy leaves a wife and ten
children to mourn his loss. Dan and
Sam Purdy, of this town are broth
ers of the deceased Dr. Ernest
Bruce, of Homer, has been appoint
ed deputy vstate inspector of live
ROSS
Nebraska
stock for the state of Nebraska.
This is a great boost and honor for
our local veterinarian, and should
be appreciated by his many patrons.
Dr. Bruce is a graduate from the
Kansas veterinarian school and reg
istered in the state of Nebraska, and
Homer and vicinity should be proud
of the honor conferred upon him.

Mrs. Earl McAfee, Sunday, Novem

the second child of Orville and Lucy
Beith, of Jackson, Neb., died the

brought to Springbank for burial.
The funeral services were held Fri
day morning at 10 o'clock, at the
Friends church, conducted by Miss
Brown, the pastor, and interment
made in Springbank cemetery. The
little child died after a brief illness
of only a few days. Death was
thought to be caused from stomach
and heart trouble. The parents
have the sympathy of the entii com
munity in their sad bereavement.
Sioux City Journal, 26: Comple
tion or the new drainage system
near Jackson, Neb., whereby the
waters of Elk creek are diverted in
to Jackson lake and from there to
the Missouri river was celebrated
yesterday afternoon by the residents
of the town. The fire whistle of the
town was blown for fifteen minutes,
starting at 5 o'clock. The celebra
tion yesterday marked the finishing
of a project which was started twelve
years ago. When it was announced
that the waters of the creek were to
be diverted from their course south
east to the Missouri river, to a north
easterly direction into Jackson lake,
700 residents of Dakota county sign
ed a petition for an injunction. The
case was taken into the county court
at Dakota City and an injunction
stopping the work was granted.
The case then went into the district
court, where the injunction was dis
solved. The petitioners then appeal
ed to the Nebraska supreme court.
It was sent back to the district court
and again dissolved. Altogether
the case has been in the district
court twice, twice in the Nebraska
supreme court, in the United States
supreme court and in the tederal
court at Omaha. The opinion of the
United States supreme court was
written by Justice C. E. Hughes.
He sustained the district court of
the state in dissolving the injunction.
His decision was announced last No
vember. As soon as the federal
court case had been decided work
was" started to divert the course of
the creek. It has been estimated
that the cost of fighting the case
through the twelve years has
amounted to $30,000. A number of
prominent law firms of both Sioux
City and Dakota county have
been connected with the case at va
rious time3. R. E. Evans, who de
fended the drainage commissioners
when the first injunction was grant
ed, has fought the case through all
of the courts. Lawyers who were
connected with the case are Jepson
& Jepson, U. G. Whitney, W. P.
Warner, and Pizey Bros.
Sioux City Journal, 28: Miss Mar
garet Ryan, of Jackson, Neb., yes
terday underwent an operation for
the removal of her tonsils at the Sa
maritan hospital Fifty-three
nimrods competed for the turkey
fchoot held Sunday on the grounds of
the Crystal Lake Gun club. P. W.
Rasmussen, who for two days was a
member of the Sioux City Western
league baseball club this season, was
the individual star of the tourney.
Rasmussen took home three turkeys,
two geese and one duck. His broth
er, R. H. Rasmussen, took second
honors and captured two turkeys
and two geese. The shoot was the
largest of its kind ever held in this
section of the country. More than
sixty turkeys, geese and ducks were
hung up for prizes. More than 2,000
bluerocks were wrecked by the con
testants. The shoot was in charge of
Adolph Olson . . . .Traveling men and
Nebraska visitors who contemplated
Dakota City as a possible escape
from the higher railroad fare when
the announcement was made yester
day that the Nebraska trains would
not stop at bouth Sioux Uity upon
investigation found that no stops are
being made there either. Twenty
passengers with Nebraska towns as
their objective were left standing on
the Sonth Sioux City station plat
form Sunday afternoon when the
Norfolk, Neb., train on the Omaha
line, obeying a new time card, did
not stop. Orders were issued by the
Omaha railroad that no stops be
made at Dakota City or South Sioux
City, except the train to Omaha and
from Omaha on the Nebraska side
of the river. Four other trains are
affected by the ruling. Train fare
from Sioux City to South Sioux City
is 25 cents and to Dakota City 35
cents. From Sioux City to Nebras
ka towns the interstate passenger
rate is charged. By going to South
Sioux City to start into Nebraska
the passengers save .4 of a cent on
each mile. They also escape a 25-
cent bridge toll. There is a disa
greement as to whether tickets were
sold at South Sioux City to the
stranded travelers Sunday. Some
of the travelers allirm it, but the
ticket seller at the station gives evi
dence to the contrary. Among those
left on the station platform was J.
P. O'Furcy, publisher of the Cedar
County News, at Hartington, Neb.
Since the order of the interstate
commerce commission about six
months ago advancing the interstate
passenger tariff to 2.4 cents, it has
been the custom of persons going to
Nebraska cities and towns to make
South Sioux City their starting point,
in that way taking advantage of the
interstate rate, which is 2 cents a
mile. The bridge toll also was sav
ed. The trains which formerly stop
ped at South Sioux City were the
8:52 a. m. and 5:01 p. m., bound for
Norfolk, and the 9:44 a. m. and the
4:32 p. m., bound for Sioux City.
SCHOOL NOTES.
By Clarenco Linton.
The primary room is making Pil
grim posters of free hand cuttings.
The picture "The Pilgrims Going to
Church," is represented on the sand
table.
Mrs. Ream visited in the primary
and other departmi .its of the school
Friday afternoon,
Glen Wadell entered the first
grade this week, making an enroll
ment of fourty-two in the primary
department.
There will be no school on Thurs
day and Friday of this week.
The second reports are being sent
out. If parents find the marks of
their children to be unsatisfactory,
they will do the teaching corps a fa
vor by conferring about the matter..
Two-thirds of the semester is passed
and the reports given thus far indi
cate quite definately the results of
this half year's work. There are
many grades that are dangerously
low, but very few that cannot be
raised if proper effort is made.
A short progarm'of current events
was given in the high school Friday,
after which a further discussion of
the game of foot ball was carried
out.
The Sioux City team failed to
come, so the scrubs, consisting of
the 'referee, and other visitors gave
the high school team a practice
game ending in a score of 13 to 2G
in favor of the team. The sympa
thy of the people on the side lines
seems to have been with the team,
but the scrubs gave them some good
practice preparatory to the Thanks
giving game.
Long periods are being spent in
practice this week and all efforts are
being made to bring the game up to
a nigh stanaam tor inanKsgiving.
Tickets are to be had from the high
school students at 25 cents each.
We wish to sell a large number be
fore Thursday, and are expecting a
large delegation of Dakota City
people to be present. We promise
you a good game. The two teams
are well matched and each will be
in the best condition. Dakota City
will have the following line up:

GUADING POTATOES
Prevailing high prices for potatoes
this fall was a strong temptation
for growers to sell scabby potatoes, a
practice that in the long run is not
a profitable one, says the agricultu
ral botany department of the univer
sity college of agriculture.
So long as a buyer for unsound
potatoes could be found, their sale
was profitable to the grower; but as
buyers prefer to purchase from dis
tricts which maintain a reputation
for producing and shipping first-class
stock, districts from which diseased
stock has been unloaded on the mar
ket must expect to bo offered lower
prices than prevail in sections of
favorable reputation.
Western Nebraska has an oppor
tunity to establish the potato indus
try on a secure footing by insisting
upon the inspection and careful grad
ing ol ail potatoessold in that region,
by organizing an association of po
tato growers. The crop can then bo
sold under guarantee of the associa
tion. CKEAMERY COUUSE
A four-months practical creamery
course is to be offered by the dairy
husbandry department of the Uni
versity of Nebraska, January 2 to
April 14. The purpose of the course
is to provide practical training for
men interested in the commercial
side or dairying. It takes up fun
damental scientific principles and ap
plies them m practice.
Men who take advantage of this
course will have an opportunity to
do their work with the finest equip
ment available in any college in the
country.
POTATO GKOWEKS TO MEET
Plans are being made by the col
lege of agriculture and the state hor
ticultural society for a program for
Nebraska potato growers at the uni
versity farm, Lincoln, January 18,
in connection with Organized Agri
culture week.
J. C. Milward. secrotarv f tho
Wisconsin Potato Growers' Associa-1
tion and one of the most experienced
organizers of the potato industry in
the United States, is to be one of the
speakers at this meeting. A repre
sentative of the United States de
partment of agriculture and promi
nent growers of the state will also
speak.

IIKNKW AUTO CKANK CASE OIL
In using the low grade gasoline
now being sold, it is absolutely nec
essary that engines be completely
drained and refilled with clean, fresh
oil of medium grade at least once
every ,000 miles (proferably eyery
500 miles in cold weather) says .the
college of agriculture.
Unless this is attended to at regu
lar intervals, quantities of kero
sire and water accumulate In the
crank case and lead to burnt-out
bearings, worn cylinders and pistons,
fouled spark plugs, and carbonized
motors. No doubt a great deal of
engine trouble to be found now is
duo to the above difficulties.
GOOD SIRES PAY
Farmers who use pure-bred sires
receive about $30 more for every
$100 worth of feed consumed by live
stock than do those using grade sires,
according to figures compiled by the
farm management extension service
of the University of Nebraska.
In
round numbers, scrub live stock
turn only about four-fifths of
value of the feed they consume.
