think, as I read in your col
umn's of this one and that one in
Fulton county getting an automo
bile that the farmers must be
the ones that are making the
money just now. Quite a change
as I look back twenty-one years
ago to the time when I left my
native county to dwell in the
Smoky City. I am glad indeed
to see the change for the better
and hope some day to be able to
see a train pull into McConnells

will be the butt of all jokes, as
having no railroad.

Work is temporarily suspended

The grading from Fort Loudon
to the top of the mountain is
probably three-fourths completed
and a long stretch on the west
side of the mountain. The sta
tion building at McConnellsburg
is almost done. Thousands of
ties have been delivered along
the grade, and there is little
reason for believing that the
work will not go on. It is not to
be expected that a work of such
magnitude will proceed without
a hitch once in awhile.

HEALTH AND BIG BUSINESS
Little Talks on Health and Hjgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Efficiency is generally consid
ered the god of Big Business.
Certain it is that great corpora
tions have carried organization
to a point which has materially
ncreased the effectiveness o f
their employees; therefore, it is
not surprising to find that in all
great commercial and industrial!
plants there are well organized
medical departments.
The employers who have upon
their rolls tens of thousands of
men and wonen find that it pays
them to provide for the adequate
medical care of their working
men and women. This has been
carried to a degree which would
have been considered astounding
generation ago. Practically
every department store has its
medical and nursing staff. Some
even have dentists and chirop
odists whose services are at the
disposal of their employees.
Instead of considering the ap
plications without regard for
their physical condition, examina
tions are now required in order
that sufferers from tuberculosis
and other diseases will not be
added to the force of employees
apd menace the healthy workers
and the establishment's custom
ers. Great industrial plants not
only offer medical and surgical
treatment to their employees,
but the majority of them con
duct wellfare work, carrying
modern medical and sanitary
practice into the homes of their
employees to the great benefit
and protection of the workers
and their families.
It has been demonstrated be
yond the question of a doubt that
this is an excellent investment
from the employers standpoint
No man can render the max
imum of service who is physi
cally unfit. Big business has
proved health a primary neces
sity in industay and it is willing
to pay for it .
The employees have never been
taken better care of than at the
present time. This has come
about through the educational
work of health authorities with
the assistance of the public press.
Had Nice Trip.
Mr. Austin Cardaugh is spend
ing a week among his Fulton
county relatives and friends.
Mr. Carbaugh spent four months
during the pa3t summer in Illi
nois visiting among former Ful
ton county people. While there
he saw Andrew Glenn, the
Houcks, Mrs. Jacob Unger (Han
nah Glenn), Ella Lock hart
(formerly Ella Lucasof the Cove),
George Doyle, Seymour Carbaugh
and Austin's sons Elmer at
Rockford, and Humphrey at Ce
dar Rapids. Austin says the
Fulton county people living in
Illinois are all getting along fine
as silk. As hands seemed to be
scarce Austin took off his coat
and ploughed corn, helped to
thresh and made himself general
ly useful. He must have pleased
his employer for at the end of
36i days work his boss gave him
a check for 580. 00 Mr. Carbaugh
says the farmers there are
mighty glad to have a chance to
get labor at two dollars, a day
and board, of cour3e.

Do Potatoes Pay?
The farmer who raises 220
bushels to the acre this year and
is able to unload them at the
present market price has no rea
son to complain. If there is such
a thing as knowing how to keep
hens on the job when eggs are
bringing anywhere from three to
five cents a piece, there is such a
thing as knnwing how to have
lots of potatoes to sell wheh they
bring from $1.25 to $1.80 a bushel.
"There are certain underlying
principles in the production of a
successful and profitable potato
crop which are always present,
and must never be overlooked,"
says William M. Patton, of Mos
grove, Armstrong cnunty, a
Farmers' Institute lecturer of
the Pennsylvania Department of
Agriculture. "I would classify
them as follows:
"The soil, the seed, planting
and after care. There are thous
ands of acres planted each year
on soils, which in their present
condition, would yield a disap
pointing crop under anyone's
management.
"The tuber, unlike any other
standard crop produced upon the
average farm, developes entire
ly within the soil. It demands a
fertile, mellow, well drained,
humus filled seed bed. This con
dition we has afforded by using
a last season's clover sod from
which the second crop had not
been removed. This was rein
forced by the addition of eight
to ten loads of unleached manure
applied to the acre, in the early
fall.,
"The plot was broken in the
early spring and tilled possibly
eight to ten times before seeding
when 300 pounds to the acre of
16 per cent, acid phosphate was
applied with the grain drill.
Now, we had a seed bed abund
ant in ail the soil elements, mel
low and having such a water
holding capacity as to cause us to
have little fear of drought.
"The seed, Sir Walter Raleigh,
had been kept under such con
ditions that we were absolutely
certain every cut piece would
germinate. The seed wa3 cut
two eyes to the piece, having
been given the formaldehyde
treatment for scab, and was
planted by hand on May 5, 1916,
in furrows which had been open
ed to such a depth that the cut
pieces, planted ten inches apart
in the row, could be covered two
and one-half inches deep, and the
furrows still well ridged. These
were all leveled down with the
weeder before the potatoes were
up. We tilled fourteen times from
planting to digging, September
18th and 19th. The bugs were
never worse. We controlled them
by using one part Paris green
mixed with forty parts low grade
flour and applying in dust form
when needed.
"We never suffered seriously
from drought. The foliage was
entire season. Notwithstanding
the fact that we have our own
spraying outfit we didn't find it
necessary to spray, never having
any appearance of Blight. We
dug early, harvesting a crop of
220 bushels to the acre, and have
seeded the plot to wheat" -
Three Women Electors.
For the first time in the history
of the United States, three Cali
fornia women will sit in the elec
toral college next January.
These are the women upon
whom the voters of California
have conferred this honor: Mrs.
W. C. Tyler, Los Angeles; Mrs.
Spinks, San Francisco, and Mrs.
Wylie, of Fresno.
It Cerjainly Pays.
A year ago an Aurora girl ad
vertised at a cost of 111.25 for a
husband. She was successful
and last Saturday he died leaving
her $19, COO or a net profit of $18,
989.75. We simply can't refrain
from remarking again that it
pays to advertise.

NOVEMBER
Name9 of New Subscribers and Others Who Renewed
Their Subscription in November. Look over the
List and See the Names of Your Friends.
The November Honor Roll is somewhat larger than last month's.
There are reasons: 1. A number of subscriptions fall due in No
vember, and many people make it a point to renew their subscrip
tion promptly. 2. It is drawing down toward the close of the year
when most people like to square up all little accounts, and start the
New Year with a clean sheet 3. Then there are others who are
taking advantage of the time before the 20th of December to pay
ud all arrearages and Dav two or three years in advance while they
can get in at a dollar a year. It
list that many persons are paid two, three, four, and even five years
ahead. The Editor will regard it a great favor if all who notice by
their label, that they are behind, will send the money in, so that
we may start the new year with a clean sheet. There is not a sub
scriber on our list that owes more than a very small sum one that
can be paid just easily if attended to.
Remember, that the price to everybody will be $1.50 after the
20th of December.
