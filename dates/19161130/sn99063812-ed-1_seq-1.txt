JUAREZ, Mex., Nov. 30. There
is at least one American Institution

governments and disputes regarding
the stilus of General 'Pershing's

as usual In Mexico tbuTwInter. Hch
ginning with tomorrow, the Juarex
Jockey Club, backed by American
capuai, win open us annual loo or.
more. days of racing. -
To place the sport of horse-racing
on a, more firm footing, and toellmj,
nsto the danger of a bad reputation
through tho whong sort of gambling
on tho races, books will be replaced
at this meet by parls-mutual ma
chines? Race-track followers believe
the "Ihon men" are the best book
makers to be obtained and expect
the machines to do much toward
boosting the Juarex stock.
Juarex, the quaint old city across
the Rio Grande from El Paso, has
changed governments many times
since the track was opened, but every
ye.T has found the uJeky Club pur
sulnc Its buslnoss, regardless of
a acmne guns, nnei; and cannons
The city has been held at different
tlmos by Porflrio Dlax, Francisco
Madcro, Viotoriano Hucrta, Francis
co Villa and Venustlano Carranxn,
but none of them threatened to put
a stop to tho racing, although plants.
