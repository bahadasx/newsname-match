Rutherford's, Greater Shows, that

Marion County Fair association are

There is something doing every

SOCIETY GIRL WITH
RUTHERFORD SHOWS
In the motorcycle or autodrome
world there is no rider better known
than Miss Hazel Russell, now with
the "Dare-Devil" Watkins Drome
Show connected with the Rutherford
shows. She is not only the highest
salaries artist in her chosen profes
sion but she is the only woman who
performs acrobatic stunts on a motor
cycle while in action in an aptodrome
arena. Miss Russell is the premier
rider with Watkins in conjunction
with the Rutherford "shows.
When the big show is over and
Hazel Russell emerges from her pri
vate dressing tent, one would pick her
for a debutant or society girl. She is
slim of build and just 'past her eigh
teenth year. Miss Russell is a grad
uate of Bryn Mawr college. In school
she was remarkably fond of athletics.
One summer her father, who is a
Pittsburg banker, spent a week with
Col. Harry Polock, one of the owners
of the Rutherford Greater, Shows,
along with him being his daughter,
Hazel. The daughter had always
yearned for life with a tented organ
ization, and threatened to run away
from home unless her wishes were ac
ceded to. Her father-believed that
about one week of roughing it would
remove all traces for a desire to fol
low her inclination. s The week with
the show the little girl became infat
uated, not only with the thrilling de
sire to become a motorcyclist but with
handsome Ira Watkins as well, and
unknown to her father took daily les
sons from "Dare-Devil" Watkins, and
before the week's end she developed
into a most wonderful rider and be
came the bride of Watkins. Papa Rus
sell decided to allow her to shape her
own career, and under the guidance
of "Dare-Devil" Watkins she has de
veloped into the greatest woman
motorcyclist in the world today.
The Watkins1 live in Rutland, Vt.,
where Mrs. Watkins reigns as a so
ciety queen. ,
Germany Intends to Hold Belgium and
Northern France, Unless She
is Driven Out
(Associated Press)
London, Nov. 30. The Rheinish and
Westphalian Gazette in an article on
the principle of German peace, de
clares that the reconciliation of Ger
many and her western enemies is im
possible. The paper declares it be
lieves Chancellor -voir Bethmann Holl
weg recognizes this and adds:
"Our ultimate aim is to push thru
the west and to the ocean. Whatever
resistance offers" must be crushed'
Referring to the Balkans the Ga
zette says: "What the victor gets he
holds."
HOLD FRANCE AND BELGIUM
-
In respect to the lost German col
onies the Gazette says: "If we do not
reconquer them the French provinces
are worth twice pur colonies.- We' will
take our compensation out in France.
Let us daily tell the French that ev
ery foot we conquer is ours. We. need
not waste words about Belgium. We
need access to the channel and we
need Antwerp Whoever wants Bel
gium may fetch it from us."
The Gazette concludes that Bel
gium is more assailable than Russia
and that London can be destroyed
easier than Moscow because, it says,
Moscow costs blood and London only
torpedoes.
"We have no fantastic dreams," are
the Gazette's final words, "of conquer
ing the world. German burgherdom
is not ripe to master and govern a
world empire. We neither can or .will
destroy the British empire but the
minimum necessary for German peace
is the complete beating down of
France in 'the west and the prestige
of the German flag on all the seas."
An Amsterdam dispatch to the
Times refers to the Gazette's article
as by far the most remarkable that
has yet appeared in regard to Ger
man peace terms. The dispatch adds
that the Gazette represents great in
dustrial magnates, who as recent ex
ecutive4 changes show, are making
their influence increasingly felt. An
nexation is also advocated by Dr. Jae
ger, a member of the central party
in the Reichstag, who, writing in the
Dusseldorf General Anzeiger insists
that German blood shed in Belgium
since 1914 must not have been shed
in vain.
Would Keep the Liege .Line
"Belgium must be our guarantee,"
writes Dr. Jaeger, "for a good part
o f the war costs. We must retain per
manently the Meuse line with Liege
and Namur. Part of old Luxemburg
which has become Belgian can per
haps be ceded to the grand duchy."
After speaking of the Walloons,
Dr. Jaeger pronounced in favor of al
lowing the Belgian dynasty to remain
He declared, however, that the coun
try must be brought politically, mili
tarily and economically in closer rft
laticn to Germany.

Washington, Nov. 30. Ambassador
Gerard conferred with the president
late yesterday - andrei3L final in
structions on the views to be present
ed to the German government, regard
ing the deportation of Belgians and
submarine warfare. No written com
munications were given' the ambassa
dor. The president is understood to have
emphasized the unfavorable impres

pledges.
The ambassador left for New York
yesterday and plans to sail for Berlin

AN OMISSION
The Star unintentionally omitted
mention of Masters' float from the dis
cription of the industrial narade. This
is unfortunate, for it was one of the
best in the line.
The alarm of fire at the central
station just after noon today was
caused by a defective battery in the
electrical apparatus.

the day would end in bright weather

everything has been auspicious.

people in cars, carriages and on foot
poured , into them in a ceaseless
stream. There must have been thou
sand people beside the regular attend
ants on the grounds by 11 o'clock, and
they had seemingly only commenced

many from those nearby.
Educational Exhibit
Among the many excellent thine-s
at the Marion Cotmty Fair, the one
probably par excellent is the educa
tional department. It i3 the first
time in our history that the cause of
education has had a department all
its own, and right well do the exhibits
prove that the dignity of a depart
ment separate from the others is well
merited, and the teachers and dudHs
of Marion county are to be congraU
ulated.
The first exhibit seen upon enter
ing the hall is that of the primary
school of Ocala, where the little Deo-
pie have the prettiest of tinted book
lets of Hallowe'en and Thanksgiving,
three small sets of furniture made by
the tiny fingers of wonderfully srood
proportions; hand weaving, teaching
manual dexterity, baskets woven of
small strips of bright paper and won
derfully colored butterflies and birds
Adjoining this, is the North Ocala
school of five grades. Ther have a
well constructed map of cotton and
its products, illustrated compositions,
unusually good color work and a col
lection of small vessels of kaolin
modeling that shows the possibilities
of this Florida product, as well as the
skill of the children
The fifth grade work of the Ocala
school comes next. The illustrated
history papers in this grade's' work
are fine. One small bov showed tn tin
reporter his paper, on George Wash
ington, with real patriotic pride. The
composition which Was excellent was
illustrated with . small pictures of
Washington's birthplace, his famous
"Crossing the Delaware," Arlington
and the tomb, the last being a picture
of his sweet-faced wife. That boy
knows history as a living, vital thing,
not "dry as dust" book lore. A strik
ing map in this section was one made
up of fifteen pictures of practical
industries in Florida, viz: Fruit grow
ing, vegetables, dairy, poultry, phos
phate, turpentine, pecans, orange
growing, lime, stock,- fish, oysters,
sponges, flowers, farming and cigar
making. The pupils who made that
map will find a vocation.
The seventh and eighth grades ex
cel in map drawing. Their maps of
Florida and the United States are
beautifully tinted and accurate in pro
portions. They have also done the
unique thing of putting upon each
county in Florida and state in the
Union the product for which it is best
known. These objects are fastened
in place by a drop of mucilage and
are most realistic.
The high school has a remarkable
display of maps done in bas relief
with modeling clay. The one done by
Kenneth MacKay deserves special
mention.
The exhibits of by-products in the
agricultural display are fine. There
are eight fertilizer! whose scientific
uses are taught. Wheat with its
twelve by-products, corn with its ten,
etc. There are also the grains that
grow best in Florida, and thoughtful,
well written papers on agriculture.
Here also are specimens of practical
budding and grafting and indeed ev
erything imaginable relating to scien
tific agriculture. Boys trained by such
methods will use brain - as well as
brawn in their work, and farming
will occupy its proper place among
the practical professions of the age.
Over against this is the domestic
science exhibit made by the girls. A
tasteful and prettily appointed lunch
eon table is set which is most attrac
tive. There are three scientifically
balanced meals arranged, everything
cooked by the class in domestic
science. Also a creditable exhibit of
sewing, several neat looking dresses,
aprons and pieces of pretty lingerie.
The county schools have done well.
The only regrejt i3 that every one did
not prepare some exhibit. Moss Bluff
has a splendid industrial map of "Im
proved Farming Methods," also maps
of the cotton and corn states and a
"Picture Lesson on Hygiene." The
color work of fruits and flowers is
particularly good.

valuable beyond computation. We

Orange Springs Exhibit V
The colonist's fair of the Florida
Farms & Homes, Inc., which was held
last week at Orange Springs, occupies
all of the eastern, end of the agricul
tural building and part of the center
tables. The Marion county section of
this exhibit includes the display from
the demonstration farm at Orange
Springs and a very fine list of nro-
ducts from Burbank, both having fe-
cured several prizes.
The most artistic display, and one
of the most worthy and notable be
cause of its great variety of staple
crops, vegetables, fruits, preserves,
etc., is that of the Kenwood Star local
and the Alligator Creek local of the
Farmer's Union of Putnam county,
which are on the right of the agricul
tural building as you enter. Kenwood
took first prize for the largest and
best display of agricultural products
at Orange Springs, and Lake View,
the home of the Alligator Creek union,
second.
The Orange Springs and Burbank
poultry entries also won about twenty
prizes, two-thirds of which were blue
ribbons.
Fair Notes
A ride on the whip is like taking a
sea voyage sideways.
Wonder why it is that when an
elderly man takes a ride on the Whip
with a pretty girl young enough to be
his granddaughter that half the guys
in town stand around the fence and
grin.
H. C. Packham, who has charge of
the exit gate at. the fair grounds (he
calls it the entrance out) counted the
automobiles and Fords passing tiara
the gate between 9 a. m. and 5 p.m.
yesterday. They numbered S35. To-
day he expects there will be twice
that number.

did a splendid business at their restau
rant today. Their menu for tomorrow
