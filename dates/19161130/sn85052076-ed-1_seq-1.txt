Hughes Not Badly Beaten
Charles II Hughes will go down in history as one
of the men who very narrowly missed the presidency
as Blaine did in 1884, as Tilden did in 1876, as Henry
Clay did in 1844 rather than in the list of men w ho were
"wiped off the face of the earth" like Horace Greeley
and Alton H. Parker and WinfieLI Scott. To whatever
consolation lies in this distinction Mr. Hughes and his
friends are fully entitled.
The Republican candidate carried his own state by
a handsome plurality. He carried his oponent's home
state of New Jersey. Hughes, besides won the usually
doubtful Indiana and Connecticut, and the imperial state
of Illinois. In looking over the field he can see much
that is highly complimentary to him. Nor is there any
thing in the returns to indicate that any other Republican
candidate would have run any better.
The situation within the Republican . party calls for
nothing sensational. It invites no radical overturn. The
organization is in good fighting trim today, in apparent
control of the newly elected House of Representatives,
and narrowly missing the presidency. Its duty is to go
forward, on existing lines, in the realizations that it will
not always have to make its battles against a Democra
cy saved from the effects of many of its own errors by a
colossal struggle in arms on the other" side the seas.

"SUBMIT THE AMENDMENTS"
By 1. W. VtnWlnkle
We lake I In titwrty of quoting

but displayed most prominently in

Tli war news from the several

Quoting further: "The Time has
come to the deliberate conclusion
that, as soon a possible, there

stitulional amendments which have
for their object the establishment
of prohibition, and woman suffrage

Austria-Hungary has a new mon

The new Emperor is Charles Fran

three years old and quite demo
cratic in his ideas and habits. His
position will be a very hard one but
he may prove to be the man for the
emergency.
England has found it necessary

Captain Hokxon is authority for
