Chicago, 111., Nov. 28. The double
tra' kin? of part of the Chicago & Al
ton Railroad lin3 from RoodhotPe.
Hi., to Kaunas City is the initial step
in a comprehensive plan announced
by V. G. Eierd. president of the com
nany, yesterday providing for the ul
timate change in the road from a 1
per cent to a .5 per cent grade, at a
cost of approximately r.'rn million
dollars.
The first work will bo thi double
tracking of the tracks from .Mexico
to Booth, Mo., and a spur of Hack
near Kansas City, as yet undeter
mined, involving a total of 90 m le?.
That means an expeditnre of more
than two milion dollars and will take
care of the freight capacity for the
;u-xt five years.
Early next spring a contracting
outfit will be organized by thi Alton
which will be operated by the road
and which will begin work immedi
ately on the proposed improvements..
This necessarily means slow work as
it provides for the spreading of the
jo st over a period of years.
Operations will of ue-oity be
dov. present nlans providing for only
30 miles of double track for 'he next
three years. This wor; lus Veen ar

it will do the most good.
