Along in October of i6ii, Governor
Rradford of the then new colony of j
Massachusetts, and the settlers of the',
colony, discovered to their intense sur-
prc that they were in l"le
ger of starving to death during tne ,
coming winter. The first bumper corn ,
crop of the 1'nited States had been
laid bv. There was lots of tobacco to .
be shipped back to Kngland. The!
woods were full of berries and bears, I
fruits and game.
and things looked as
tho a large percentage of the se
settlers ;
would survive the winter.
In fai t, the prospects were so rosy
that one of the prominent men of the
rolonv wrote to a' friend in England
that "If
.iave once but kino
h. una shcn. 1 make no uuestion
but men might live as contented here
as in any part of the world.' :
The usual method of celebrating
any such state of affairs was to pro-
claim a last day, hut Governor Brad- ,
ford was nothing if not original, :
w herefore four hunU'is were sent out i
to bring in what game they might, j
anil a real feast was planned to talic
Jdace in November. .

reaMon-iidy typical ot' the Thanksgiv- :
ing reason of lod.iy, were totally ab- ;
i;tnt from the celebration In 1621. In j
fart, they wore far from the mind of
thf- governor when he iesued the first
Thanks v.ny proclamation.
The Custom lias Stood.
Hut the custom stood,, as men be
came mre and more "content to live
in America." P'or many yeaus it was
chiefly confined to the New Kngland
states. In 1858 only 2b states parti
cipated in the holiday thru the pro
clamations of their povernors. Abra
ham Lincoln, when he issued his pro-;
clamation in 1864. first gave the day j
national significance. Since that time j
it has btcome a true American holi- !

New York, Nov. 30. New York
proceeded to the important business
of the day today, thanks to the stub

Manv women, not admitting the
boycott war was over, kept up their
price resistance even until today and
in consequence got the national b"ird
tat prices well under those of lat

CUDAHY SALES SWELL
Year's Business of $133,960,966 In
creases Profits Fourfold.
Chicago, Nov. 30. Sales of the
Cudahy Packing company in the fis
cal year ending October !?H were
$133,960,966, compared with J116.
162.155 the previous year, while net
profits were $3,011,416 against $723.
642 in the previous twelve months.

pared to $609,242 the previous year.
These figures were made public today
in the annual report.
E. A. Cudahy calls to the attention
of the stockholders that out of every
dollar taken in from the sale of all
products derived from animals, 80
cents has gone to the farmer. Out
of the remaining 20, 7 cents has been
paid to the wage earner, 5 cents for
freight and 4 cents for material need
ed in manufacturing and in prepara
tion of the goods for sale. Out of the
remaining 4 cents the company has
paid interest, taxes, insurance, repairs
and similar items, it was said, and
there is less than 2 cents per dollar
of gross sales left as net profit to the
company.
JUST PLAIN CHICKEN
Turkey Too Fancy Eating for Econ

Chicago, Nov. 30. Wouldn't you
like to be on the diet squad today
no turkey, plum pudding or hot mince
pie?
Health Commissioner Robertson's
dieters lived on a skimped and cut
menu for a week hoping that they
were being trained down for a whal
ing big turkey feast today, but it now
appears that the 6 cents saved daily
for each person is to be sacrificed on
the altar of economy. At any rat
the eaters will sit down to roast
chicken instead of gobbler today.

Belieye Czar's Force Will Turn
Back Germans.
London, Nov. 30. The allies are
pinning their faith on the Russians to
extricate Rumania from the German
war pincers.
Dispatches today indicated that the
czar's forces were pounding vigor
ously at German positions in the
southern Carpathians, inaugurating an
offensive which experts here were con
fident would force Field Marshal von
Mackensen to cease some of his pres
sure on the Rumanian forces now
approaching the line from which they
will defend the capital.
The Russian thrust at Kirlibaba wa.s
regarded here as the best possible
strategic move since if successfully
maintained, it would force a straight
ening out of the German lines per
mitting the Rumanians to gain hack
. goodly part of Transylvania. If the
German line was not straightened out
under these conditions, it would be in
danger of a strong flanking movement.

ChaneeHer- Infrotlaces Bill for

Germany Ready for Peace, but
Foe Doesn't Want It.
Berlin, Nov. 30. In presenting the
bill providing for compulsory service
of civilians for war purposes, the
chancellor, spoke in regard to the mil
itary situation and the purposes of
the measure. It was the chancellor's
sixtieth birthday and his desk was
decorated with chrysanthemums.
"The war continues, with its des
tructive forces," the chancellor said.
"Accordingly our enemies desire it.
They celebrated the past summer as
a period of victory. But did they ob
tain what they wanted?
"Our lines are unbroken and Ru
mania thru which a great change of
events was expected, is now atoning
for which she did. God has helped
us up to the present. He will help us
further.
Idle Hands Help Enemy,
"The almost superhuman heroism
of our troops which cannot be ex
pressed in words of thanks and our
clear conscience since we. the first and
only ones, were ready and are ready to
end the war by a peace guaranteeing
our existence and our future they give
us moral right to such confidence.
"But. gentlemen, this right ought
not to make us forget duty. Our en
emies do not yet desire peace. They
have superior numbers at their com
mand and almost the whole world de
livers war material to them."
The chancellor urged the neces
sity to do everything in Germany's
power in order to manufacture the
necessary war material, saying:
"Hands that are idle assist the
enemy."

Washington, Nov. 30. Evidence
continued to pile up here today that
congress is going to spend consider
able of its precious time in the com
ing short session looking for a high
cost of living panacea.
Here are some of the remedies
which early arrivals at the capital
have suggested and which they say
they will push in resolutions to be
introduced :
An embargo on all foodstuffs.
A law compelling those who store
foodstuffs for speculative purposes
to dispose of 10 per cent of their
holdings every thirty days, at pre
vailing prices.
Investigation of the entire ques
tion of high prices, either by the
federal trade commission or a spe
cial joint congressional committee,
which will recommend legislation
suggested by its findings.
Wilson Prefers Last Method.
That the president and his cabinet
will strongly favor the last sugges
tions, senators and representatives say,
is a foregone conclusion.
The president has discussed the
high cost of living frequently with his
cabinet advisers and he is taking deep
interest in the work of the postoffice,
commerce and agriculture depart
ments along this line.
The embargo idea, besides having
Representative Fitzgerald of New
York to lead, will have the strong
backing of many other congressmen.
Representative Jeff McLemore said to-
day he will favor it, and that he has
interviewed or heard by mail from
many others who will do the same.

New ' York. Nov. 30. Patrick E.
Quinn. government commissioner for
New South Wales, explained the Aus

recommends its adoption by the
United States.
The plea of the Housewives' league
and the remedial system outlined by
Quinn dovetail with Governor Whit

York's food supply by a state food

Julian Heath, president of the House
wives' league, praised Governor Whit
man's action. . -
"With speculators holding a gun to
the heads of the American people,
your situation seems to demand dras

establish government control of food

poultry and like foodstuffs to boost
prices is only less criminal than the
destruction of food to keep the mar

Francisco.
