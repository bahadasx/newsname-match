SAM LOYD TAKES
ANOTHER BRIDE
8am Loyd, one of Blackfoot 's re
spected and retired farmers, who lias
been a widower for many years, got
tired of living alone and concluded to
again take a plunge into the sea of mat
rimony. Last Thursday he told his
friends that he was going to California,
but instead went to Butte where he
met Mrs. Louise Kestner, a charming
widow whom he lmd loved for more
than a year. From Butte the happy
couple returned to Pocatello where
Judge Knowles united two lonely hearts
into one of happiness and contentment.
They returned to Blackfoot Friday
morning, and Friday night about a
dozen of their friends, led by Chas.
Fisher, went in search of the sly Sam.
The newly weds were expecting a dis
turbance and hied to the home of the
bride's sister-in-law, Mrs. Jas. Young,
where they were captured. After ex
tending sincere congratulations to the
bride, 8am was forcibly but gently
dragged from the house and what his
friends did not do to him is better left
unsaid. The many friends of Mr. and
Mrs. 8am Loyd wish them a long and
happy life of matrimonial bliss and
prosperity.

HOSPITALITY — MA Y IT BE GENUINE
Death of Ex-Saloonist and
Sheriff-Elect.
William Alexander West, of Ameri
can Falls, better known as ' ' Doc ' ' West,
the pioneer saioonman and baseball
sport who was recently elected sheriff
of Power county on the Democratic
ticket, and who lias been on the pneu
monia route for the past several days,
passed in his chips last Sunday morning
at the Evans hotel. Although known
as a saioonman and the bitterest oppo
nent of local option in the state, ' ' Doc ' '
West was also known as an honorable,
honest man, a good citizen and a loyal,
fearless friend. lie leaves a mother,
wife and an adopted daughter and an
estate of about $100,000.
About two years ago when the coun
jty commissioners of Power county, then
Oneiday county, refused to issue any
more saloon licenses, Mr. West peacea
bly and willingly complied with the
law and moved across the Snake river
within a few huudred rods of his old
place of business. Here lie owned 160
acres which he made very profitable
by the sale of wet goods, which for
years attracted trade from all over the
State until Blaine's dry vote forced
him out of business. "Doc" and all
his friends and neighbors were natural
ly damp creations and done everything
possible to defeat local option, even
going as far as starting the Power
City Times with Trux Talbot as editor.
Deceased and his friends were also
bitter enemies of Senator Brady and
when the editor of the times displayed
the photograph of their political enemy
on the top of his printery, "Doc" be
came enraged and pulled the scribe's
nose until he ascended a ladder and
removed the objectionable, picture of
the first governor who promised to close
every saloon in Idaho.
Though of a quiet, retiring disposi
tion, an unassuming, non-aggressive
nature, few people that knew him ever
attempted to interfere with "Doc's"
rights, and we have neevr known him
to be either ungenerous or unjust in his
demands with the men of his associa
tions.
a
Though kind, and accommodating
back of the bar or on the street, he was
a man of very few words and good
judgment, and what he said was gener
ally considered about the right dope
by the boozer, the gambler or the ball
tosser. among whom there are many
who will mourn his and and sudden
death when he was about to enter the
threshold of a new and more dignified
career of a county sheriff for a people
many of whom considered him a moral
and social outlaw—as a saloon ist. Oth
erwise, those having dealings or ac
quaintance with him will always remem
ber him as a good citizen and a friend
to everybody who sought his aid, whctli
er it be advice or something more sub
stantial, and the worst that can be said
about him is in regard to his occupa
tion, which was conducted as lawfully
and morally as possible to make it prof
itable. No man will regret "Doc"
West's death more than Lorenzo Ev
ans, who was elected State senator on
the same ticket with him. They were
life long puls and partners and equally
shared many of the pleasures and vi
cissitudes of Power county when it was
known universally as the outlaw state.
Deceased was quite well known in
Blackfoot, where he was several times
present with tht American Falls base
ball team, which lie practically main
tained for years. Though 50 or more
years he was still an enthusiastic ball
tosser and a generous contributor to the
sport.

HIS REMAINS
SHIPPED HOME
Mr Keith, the aged father of Mrs.
Herman Stufflebeam, was overtaken
with a fatal stroke of apoplexy about
8 o'clock, last Monday morning. The
old gentleman, though suffering with a
cold for several days, was feeling quite
well when he arose at 7 o'clock Monday
morning and was anxious to attend to
the furnace as was his custom, but Mr.
Stufflebeam refused to allow him to
do so, and insisted that lie remain in
bed. Soon after Mrs. Stufflebeam
heard a strange noise in her father's
room and notified her husband, who
accompanied her to the old gentleman's
room, where they found him half dress
ed and dead ou the floor. Neighbors
were immediately summoned and the
body was taken care of. Apoplexy
was the cause of the old man 's death
which overtook him at the age of 82
years. The body was shipped to White
Hall, N. Y., yesterday morning, and
was accompanied to the deceased's
birth and burial city by Mr. and Mrs.
Herman Stufflebeam, who will make
an extended visit in their old home.
Besides Mrs. Stufflebeam, the deceased
leaves a married daughter in Whito
Hall, where Mrs. Stufflebeam has an
aged uncle who is quite sick, and it is
feared that the shock of Mr. Keith's
death may prove fatal to him. ?
