BIO SUIT TO
- flllilUL LEASE
Baxter Men Seek to Recover
Lands from Big Mining
r . t Companies.
s
A suit that Involves mining
rights to 560 acres of land in the
Commerce-Cardin district, and
embraces several big preducing
properties the value of which
rum upwards from $5,000,000,
was filed in Muskogee, Okla.,
Friday by Walter T. Apple of
Baxter Springs and H. N. Harris
of Kansas City, against the Com
merce Mining & Royalty company
and the 0. M. Bilhars Mining
company. It is one of largest
suits ever filed in the U. S. court
of eastern Oklahoma. The suit
filed is for so injunction against
the defendant and to quiet title
in mining rights and for damages
to ores removed by Jhe defend
ants. A receiver for the working
mines is aaked and a hearing up
on this petition has been set for
December 11 at Muskogee before
Judge Ralph Campbell. The
claim of the plaintiffs is for the
exclusive right to mine and oper
ate these properties under a lease
dated May 10 of last year and
they charge that the defendants
have trespassed upon their rights
and are now trespassing upon
them, in violation of the act of
congress of which autnor
izes Qaapaw Indians to lease
their lands for mining purposes
for a period of ten years, but not
longer. The Commerce Mining
& Royalty company is the largest
single producer of lead'and sine
n Oklahoma and is holder of by
Tar the richest field ever opened.
These mines sre now operating
and producing about sixty tons
of concentrates a day. Four
other mills are being built on this
property and all is proven to be
underlaid with lead and sine and
has an estimated value of from
$5,000,000 to $10,000,000.
Rose Wants Franchise,
John R. Rose, the well known
railroad promoter, has an appli
cation before the city of Commerce
for m franchise to construct, main
tain and operate a single or
double tract interurban electric
railroads along and across the
streets ot that city. A special
election to vote on the proposi
tion has been authorised by a
city ordinance. The Rose project
is not the same as the Oklahoma
& Norchern, which company
claims to be building from Bart
lesville, Oklahoma, to Baxter
Springs. Commenting on the
Rose railroad project the Com
merce News says:
"His road is planned to run
from Columbus to Picher, and
trotn Baxter to Picher. From
there the line by way of Cardin
will be extended to Commerce,
and there on to the South or
Southwest Just what route it
will take after leaving Commerce,
is not as yet known. The road
asks for no bonus or any pledge
of any kind, pays all expenae of
the election and - takes its own
chances as to business. All kinds
of rumors regarding traffic lines,
said to.be coming this way are in
circulation. This proposition is
the only one so far brought to
the attention of the Town Board."

petus this week by the news that

ered ore and 138 feet and at 153
feet were still in ore when the
drill bit broke off, and work is
temporarily tied up. The ore
ssmples taken from the hole ap
peared to be as rich in color as
the samples recently taken from
the hole on the Ebenrtein pro
prety. The hole was r k in the
same draw with the nope ot
striking the same vein and ap
parently the drillers'were success
