PROTOCOL SIGNED
FOR ARMY RECALL
CARRANZA WILL BE GIVEN O.VE
MORE CHANCE TO DO RIGHT
TOWARD U. S.
k„.
„., Nov. 25.—A
Atlantic City, N. J.
idim
protocol providing for the conditional
withdrawal of the American troops
now in Chihuahua.. Mexico, and for
the military control of the border, but
with the supplemental stipulation
that the United States troop* shall
bis sent into Mexico in pursuit ox ban
dits at any time the American gov
ernment deem* it necessary, was
signed here late yesterday by the
members of the Mexican-American
joint commission.
U. S. Ratification Expected
Only General Carranza and General
Villa stood as possible obstacles to
fruition of the Atlantic City agree
ment for withdrawal of General J. J.
Pershing's forces from Mexico-with
in the next 40 days.
The American government itself is
prepared to ratify the protocol, inas
much as it was shaped upon terms
President Wilson himself aprove.
What Carranza will do is a prob
lem, though the administration be
lieves lie will sign it, oven though it
may be distasteful because of inclu
sion of provisions that the United
States troops may follow bandits into
Mexico at any time.
Issue Hinges on Battle'
The other obstacle—Villa—maybe
eliminated by the Chihuahua City
battle, military men say. But, hey
do not overlook the disastrous situa
tion that would foHow a Villa victory
at this strategic point.
Villa is an element in the situation
from the fact that the withdrawal is
conditional upon conditions remaining
satisfactory during the next 40 days.
A Villa victory now would upset all
withdrawal plans and create intoler
able northern Mexican conditions, ex
perts say.
Carranza probably wil lacqiuesce,
"it is thought here, in the light of
what his representatives have been
told. During the last week, the Amer
ican members of the commission have
been bluntly frank in informing the
Mexican group of what consequences
they may expect if thev do not meet
American terms.
Session Dec. 8 Provided
If the protocol is ratified by the
two governments the commission will
convene again Dec. 8 to resume dis
cussion of which nuestions affecting
the two countries, especially those
related to the protection of the life
and property of Americans and other
foreigners in Mexico.
If ratification by either government
is withheld, the work of the con
ference will be declared at an end.
Following is a paraphrase of the
agreement:
First—The American troops now
in Chihuahua, command by General
John J. Pershing, shall be withdrawn
within 40 days from the approval of
the protocol by the respective govern
ments, provided that within that time
the conditions in that part of Mexico
have not become such as to endanger
the American border. In such event
the time shall be extended.
Second—The Mexican army shall
patrol the Mexican side of the bor
der and the American army the
American side, but this shall not pre
clude, co-operation between the two
forces to preserve peace upon the
border.
Third—It shall be left to the com
manding officers of the armies on the
border of both nations to enter into
such arrangements for co-operation
in operations against bandits when
ever it is possible.
Statement by Secy Lane
The right of the American govern
ment to send troops across the bor
der npursuit of bandits was not in
corporated in the protocol, but was
made the subject of a supplemental
memorandum. The Mexicans had
contended earnestly against signing
any agreement in which they appear
ed to sanction what they termed the
violation of their national territory.
After the protocol was signed Sec
retary Franklin K. Lane issued a
statement defining to a certain extent
the policy of the United States gov
ernment toward Mexico.
He stated that he believed General
Carranza a strong man and that he
shoiild be given a "full chance,"
adding that "Mexico will either do
right without her help or with it.
This is her choice."
Tha statement follows:
"The full policy of the United
States with reference to Mexico is
not to be stated in a phrase or in any
protocol or series of protocols.
Rights of Defense Reserved
"We are to come out of Mexico
just as soon as we can 'decently and
in order,' and because we have other
use for our troops who are there. But
this is only a beginning to a policy
which will make a Mexico that we
'can live with.
"The border troubles are only symp
toms. Mexico needs system treat
ment—not symptom treatment. She
can give it to herself, and we hope
she will. We shall reserve to our
selves the right to treat her invading
bandits as they should be treated,
chasing them to a finish if necessary,
unless Mexico gets right into shape
to do-.this herself.
Praise for Carranza
"Carranza is a strong man, I be
lieve. His career shows that and his
followers admire him to the point of
reverence. He is the man to be given
a full chance and we shall uphold him

"It long has been the custom of ottr

"The year that has elapsed since
we last observed our day of Thanks

the peoples upon whom war has
brought disaster without choice or
possibility of escape on theii part.
We cannot think or our own happi

Smooth Versus
Scabby Potatoes
Jake Eastgate is a practical demon
strater He took ten pounds of scab
by and ten pounds of smooth pota
toes to the Devils Lake Farmers Con
vention last week and peeled both
samples to show the difference in food
units. It turned out to be a lirst
class "show me" demonstration. The
difference shown, proved to be the
most convincing argument in favor
of expert knowledge along the line
of eliminating scabby potatoes from
the field. The difference amounted
to 33 per cent. After peeling the
scabby potatoes, there remained
about 5 1-2 lbs. to place in the boilei'
and the smooth potatoes weighed S
1-2 lbs. The intrinsic value of a bush
el of potatoes depends on food units
that can be retained by careful peel

food there is in a potato, it is economy
to cook them with the "hides on."—

Fake Horse Buyer
Works Neat Game
Sheridan £bunty Authorities Issue
Warning to Farmers and
Ranchers
Sheridan County authorities have
issued a warning* .to farmers, ranch
ers and bankers to beware of one U.
H. Smith, posing as a horse buyer
for a big Chicago live stock company.
They declare they have evidence to
show that the man is an impostor, as
the firm he claims to be connected
with, say they do not know him.
At Poplar Smith drew two drafts,
one for 925,000, and another for $20,
000 on the Drexel State Bank of
Chicago, but the Chicago bank says
that South is unknown to them. Sev
eral other checks which were given
in payment of* bills came "back with
payment refused, says the Poplar
standard. ...
According to the report, Smith
started in to buy horses on a big
scale. He bargained for
strings, and branded one bunch of
them. The theory advanced is that
Smith figured to get a big bunch of
horses together, load them quick, and
by making a quick sale, beat the
game before he was discovered.
He has been gone some time now
and with every evidence that he is
gone for good. Farmers in other sec
tions are warned to be on the lookout
for the horse-buying stranger.—Glas

son, a farmer in the Horse Creek dis

last Thursday, when he was struck
and run over by a freight train.
According to those who witnessed
the accident. Peterson was standing
between the main line and side track,
talking to some men who were oil the
depot platform, who were waiting for
the Skidoo to pull out^. Peterson said
he was going to the elevator to get
a check for some grain whjch he had
marketed and started around the
Skidoo. He did not see ther freight
train which was backing in on a side
track, until it was upon him and when
he attempted to jump, he slipped and
fell beneath the wheels. I
The deceased came to Montana
from Tioga, N. D., about a year ago
and filed on a homestead in the Horse
Creek country, near Oswego, and has
lived there up to this time. He was
56 years of age and leaves a wife and
seven children to mourn his loss.
Coroner Peterson was called, and
after investigating the circumstances,
found that it was accidental. The
body was taken to Horse Creek for
burial.

Glasgow Man Drown
Skating On River
Clerk of Court of Valley County and
Prominent Rusinessman—Body
Recovered
Glasgow Courier of Nov. 24.—That
Walter Shanley has been drowned in
the' Milk River is the belief of his
closest friends.
Friday afternoon, he left his office
in the court house about 3:30, took
his skates'and went down to the Milk
River. Several persons saw him go
ing, and some saw him on the river,
but none had seen him come back.
His overcoat was left in the office
and has not been touched.
His family did not miss him until
this morning, as he had intended go
ing to Culbertson last night, and the
first information that he had met with
an accident came this morning when
Mrs. Shanley called up Deputy Clerk
of Court Oscar Cutting and asked if
Mr. Shanley had gone to Culbertson.
Mr. Cutting immediately started in
vestigating, and telegrams were sent
to Culbertson and Williston, but Mr.
Shanley had not arrived there and the
conductors on No. 4and No. 2 wired
that he was not on their trains.
This (Saturday) morning R. E.
Johnson and Nick Baynham went
down to the river and followed up
the skater's tracks on the ice. Some
distance up they came to an open
place where the tracks ended, and it
is their belief that Mr. Shanley, skat
ing there about dusk, did not see the
air hole, and went under.
A searching party is now on the
river and the ice is being broken up
in that vicinity.
Mr. Shanley is the Clerk of Court
of Valley- County, having been re
elected President of the Glasgow
Drug Co., and interested in various
other local businesses. He is very
prominent in lodge circles and is one
of the best known men in this part of
the state, having held the position of
Receiver of the U. S. Land Office for
a number of years.
Extra
Later: At 1:30* this (Saturday)
afternoon, the body was found Vy
Chuck Wilson, about 60 feet below
the place where Mr. Shanley had
gone through the ice. When the body
was brought to the surface, the con
dition of his clothes gave evidence
that he had put up a hard fight to
keep alive. His skates were still on
his shoes. The boys was brought into
town and funeral arrangements will
be announced later.

right, under the Act, to call for a
statement from the Federal Farm
Loan Board, setting forth in what
particulars the laws of the State fall
short of meeting the requirements of
the Board.
No announcement has yet been
made concerning the North Dakota
laws, but there is at least a probabil

YOUNG N0RWE6IAN
DISCOVERS GOLD
CHRISTIAN LEDEN TELLS FACIN
AT1NG TALE—METAL AND
OIL IN NORTHLAND
m.
New York, Nov. 25.—Bringing
tale of a land where gold is .mora
plentiful than in Alaska, Christian
Leden, a young Norwegian explorer,
has returned to New York city after
three years spent in the Arctic region.
As evidence of hiB story he has
harpoon head hammered out of gold
by the natives of an Eskimo village
which he says has been wiped out
since by disease. He has also sev
eral specimens of gold bearing quarts
brought to him
broui
nit to him by Eskimos, who
dared many dangers in order to gel
them. Leden said he had visited
land wMere the ground was so full of
oil that in the warm months the smett
of it filled the air.
Mr. Leden's explorations carried
him over thousands of miles in tht
country northwest of Hudson bay. Mm
went alone, and lived and traveled
with the natives and was one of them.

outfit was shipped by boat to Fort
Churchill, in Hudson bay, which waa
the starting point of his travels.
:-M
Keeps El Dorado Secret
Just where the gold and oil are,
Mr. Leden who is now at the Waldorf
Astoria, will not say. The 4lace
where the gold is to be found he did
not visit, because to have done so, he
said, would have meant another two
years in the far north. The territory
was described to him by some Eski
mos, *who told him of a great hill that
had been so split that the different
strata were uncovered. Here the red
dish yellow metal could be seen. Mr.
Leden persuaded some of those pour
neying north to search out the place.
"The Eskimos that went in to find
it had a terrible time," he said. "Their
dogs died and they had to win their
way back to the place where I was.
staying through terrific weather.
They attempted to bring back sev
eral large specimens of the gold, but
conditions became so bad they had
to throw them away.
"One very old man told hom his
grandfather, the possessor of an old
fashioned big bore gun, had found a
yellow metal that he had hammered
out to make bullets. The stories of
the Eskimos would indicate that gold
is up north in greater abundance than
in Alaska. The natives, of course,
have no idea of its value.".
*"S«#
11.50 PER YEAR IN ADVANCE
Brings Records of Music
Mr. Leden's expedition was planned
with the "idea of making a scientific
survey of the country and its people.
He said he believes the Eskimos had
a common ancestor with the Ameri
can Indian. He bases his opinion
chiefly on their folk lore and their
music. He took a phonographic out
fit into the far north, and he brought
back many records of Eskimo music.
"The Eskimos have a wonderful
language," he said.
"It is hard to master because the
same word will express so many dif
ferent things depending upon the in
fection, the pronunication, and relative
position. It is much the same as the
Indian language. There is the same
similarity in tneir myths and in their
poetry.
"Each individual composes his own
songs, and by them gives expression
to his feeling. Their instrumental
music is entirely confined to the
drum.''
Traveling with the natives, he said,,
was not only full of peril, but re
quired the utmost diplomacy. The
natives are superstitious and they
have a firm belief in good and bad
spirits.
Suspicious of White Men
A white man is considered more of
a bad spirit than a good one and this,
Mr. Leden said, makes him at all
times a sort of Jonah in the camp.
If the weather is bad, if an accident
happens or if sickness comes it is al
ways the white man who is regard
ed as the cause. If he becomes very
sick, they are sure it is another mani
festation of the anger of the good
spirit and so they never lack for an
excuse to abandon him.
Tribes living within a few miles of
each other he found had no words in
common, but the roots of their words
were the same. Their common blood
is also shown, he said, by the struc
ture of their music and their manner
of delivery and it is by these means
that he hopes to prove to the scien
tific world that the -Eskimos are re
lated by blood to the Indian and not
to the Mongol.
Although he is only 35 years old
Mr. Laden has made five trips into
he unknown regions of the far north.
He is commissioned by the Univer
sity of Norway at Christiania, and
also by the geological survey of Can
ada.

cribed as 'First in war and first in
