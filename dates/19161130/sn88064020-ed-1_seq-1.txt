neers in a conference at the Grune
wald Hotel Tuesday afternoon. The
mayor replied that he was going to
attend and would make every ef
n fort to take a representative delega
- tion with him.
The meeting Tuesday afternoon
was in connection with the effort to
have the Mississippi River Commis
sion suspend in one instance the rule

0 cane of September 29, 1915. requir
it ing that the base of a rebuilt levee

I- pocket has developed at the Third
e district ferry landing in Algiers due
to the wash caused by the ferryboat
e landing there. The Orleans Parish
L. evee Board was engaged in re
building this levee when the last
high water caused a stoppage of the
y work.
Wi:liam McL. Fayssoux, president
of the levee board, told Senator
n Ransdell the requirement to go back
1' 150 feet would result in the destroy
ing of unusually valuable property,
which would render the cost exces

Lawton explained the condition of
the levee at this point. No ferry
boat is operating there at present.
other than a gasoline boat, though
a new ferryboat is in the course of
construction, he said. The pocket
has been caused by the landing of
the ferryboat, but with the new one
a reversal in the method of landing
{ would be arranged, though this, he
said, would cause the development
of another pocket above unless the
levee was reconstructed before it
went into operation.
Mayor Behrman also spoke of the
Importance of the work being done
at once, and of the desire to sus
pend the 150-foot rule. Major W.
Goff Caples brought the conference
to a happy conclusion by saying he
would write a letter to the commis

this Instance. Major R. C. Moore,
who is to succeed Major Caples in

engineers, also attended the meeting.

brings.
Here are the "don'ts" the superin
tendent of police advises the shoppers
to observe:
Don't lay your pocketbook on coun
ters while making purchases.
Don't carry your satchels or purses
on your arm.
Don't "fall" for the pocketbook
game.
Don't carry your wallets-this for
men-in your hip pockets.
Don't wear watch fobs exposed
without a safety.
Don't permit yourself to be Jostled
on a crowded street car. Pickpockets
work in "mobs."

SREY. H. M. BROWN v
LEAVES ALGIERSI
At the Methodist Ministers' Annual
Conference which was held at Baton
Rouge the regular assignments were
e made and Rev. R. M. Brown, who has
i been associated with the Methodist
re Church here during the last four
n years was sent to the Felicity Street
p Church in the city.
Id During Mr. Brown's stay here in
Ah Algiers he has made many friends and
te it is with deep regret from not only
I his parishoners but from the gen
e eral public that Mr. Brown leaves out
e duistrict and we are pleased to know
to that he is not going out of the city
f- and will be a frequent visitor here.
a Mr. Brown's pastorate here will
be remembered as one of great activ
n ity. It was through his unceasing
to and untiring effort that so much head
1- way has been made toward raising
the fund for the erection of the new*
- church. While here he has provided
for the purchase of the ground. Plans
Aand specifications are at hand and it
.d will only be a short time now until
e the actual building of the church will
t be begun.
1h When Mr. Brown leaves the Meth
e- odist church in Algiers he leaves one
at of a general harmony and this is say
ie ing so much for a minister because
'general harmony does not always ex
it Ist in church circles for the fact there
r is rivalry in efforts to do good and to
k be prominent in church work Just the
r- same as in any other institution. Mr.
v, Brown's greatest adaptability for this
s- work and the method with which he
I- has handled the situation here gives
h him everlasting credit among those
'r who will always remember him.
Besides Rev. Brown, Mrs. Brown
. will be greatly missed here among her
h many friends. Her lovable disposi
tion and her cooperation in the work
tof her husband will also be remem
if bered. The Algiers people unite
e with The Herald in wishing them
g God's Speed in their new location.
e Assignments of other ministers who
it were at one time connected with the
e local church are as follows: Rev.
It Jno. F. Foster, Bayou Lachute; Rev.
F. N. Parker, president of Emory Col
e lege; Rev. A. J. Gearhard, Louisiana
e Avenue; Rev. R. H. Wynn, president
i- Centenary College; Rev. J. W. Booth.
'. Merryville; Rev. H. S. Johns, chap
e lain. State Penitentiary; Rev. A. F.
e Vaughan, Carrollton Avenue; Rev. K.
' W. Dodson, Minden; Rev. J. M. Hen
ry, presiding elder, Ruston; Rev. W.
n A. Mangam, McDonoghville.
Dr. A. C. King was appointed one
r of the trustees of the N. O. Christian
Advocate Building.
NEGRO AGAIN IN TROUBLE.
1 Arthur Brooks, alias Red Sun, no
, torious negro thief, is again behind
t the bars and along with him the po
. lice took his mother, Eleanor Hoff
t man, who gave the officers a severe
y tongue-lashing when they went
i. through her home fi search of the
e fugitive Friday afternoon. Brooks
was found by Patrolmen Hyde and
DeRocha, Special Officer James P.
8 Selph and Citizen. Geo. Kaiser near
the outfall canal at the Intersection
of Parragut street, where he was
seated munching a cheese sandwich.
The officers covered him with their
s revolvers, in spite of which fact he
made a motion to draw a weapon from
k h:s hip pocket, but it was afterwards
discovered that he was not armed.
Brooks is still suffering from a severe
wound in the stomach, inflicted by
Special Officer Harry, of the South
ern Pacific Railroad, and now un
der a charge of wilfully shooting at
I with intent to murder.
MUTINY CHARGE 18 REFUSED.
The United States Court refused to
accept an affidavit of mutiny on the
thigh sea which Patrolman Flemming
i desired to make against Walter Scott,
a negro, 30 years old, employed as a
- deck hand by the Soathern Improve
ment and Ferry Company, as a result
I of the alleged striking by the negro
of Captain John Clark, superintend
ent of the company, Friday morning.
The negro was charged with assault
and battery in the Second City Crim
Inal Court. He was arrested on the
complaint of Captain Clark, who is
said to have been struck on the head
with a stick by the negro while on the
ferry A. M. Halladay.
