"What did you and Albert Jones do

"I Jumped out and started the car
and we went back to VllHsca." .McCaull
answered. He said he didn't recollect
what time they got back to Villlsca.
"Had you" contemplated In that trip

He also was called upon to deny that
he had ever been there with F. F.

Montgomery testified she had.
Bone Not From Moore Skull.
Asked about the story of the piece of
Joe Moore's skull whkji witnesses tes
tified he had exhibited, MdCaull said:
"It wasn't a piece of skull. I picked
up a piece of bone in the alley and
showed It to the men in the billiard'
hall and made the remark that I had
seen pieces as large as that on the
floor in Joe Moore's house. Shortly
after some one came in and asked me
If I had a piece of Joe Moore's skull. I
denied it but showed them the piece of
bone."
"I'll ask you whether or not you ever
got a piece of skull from Joe Moore?"

room" in the postoffloe-jullding.
"Were you playing poker Sunday

"No sir, I was playing hearts," re»
sponded McCaull.
McCaull didn't know for sure wheth
er or not he had his car out on Satur
day.
"Where were you Saturday?"
"I don't know. I presume in my place
of business."
Mr. Mitchell was not satisfied with
the presumed part of McCauIl's answer
and wanted to know the facts.
\"Do you know what you were doing
on Saturday?" he asked.
"No."
"Where were you Sunday morning?"
asked Mr. Mitchell,
"Down to Tom Bradfleld's," re
sponded McCaull.
"What time did you get down to
Tom Bradfleld's?"
"About 9 o'clock."
McCaull denied Bradfleld's room was
a "poker room." The witness said he
"supposed" he stayed at Bradfleld's un
til noon.
"Did you and Tom gamble that
day?"
"I have no recollection." McCaull
would not say be hadn't.
Mr. Mitohell asked McCaull to tell

Van Camp's restaurant.
"Were you playing poker that day?"
"I dop't recollect.''
"Where Irertf you the Sunday night

"1 don't know," was the answer.
Mr. Mitchell then directed his ques

tempts to secure an alibi for the Sun
day evening of the murder.
"You've been chasing around a good
deal to find out where you were that,
night?" asked Mr. Mitohell.
McCaull admitted he had goiie to
Corning to see Henry Curson the first
week of the present trial. "He's a per
sonal friend of mine and I wanted to
see him and I wanted to see If he rec
ollected that I was there/' explained
McCaull.
McCaull denied that Cutson bad said
to him, "YOU can't. hang an alibi on

The witness- said he knew all the

"Who were you playing hearts
with?"
"Captain Ctfsey," was the answer.
"Will you tell this Jury that you
played cards with Captain Casey?" in
quired Mitchell.
"I did if he was there," responded
the witness.
Mr. Mftchell Insisted on knowing
who McCaull was playing cards with
but received no satisfactory answers.
Calling of Mr. McCaull to the stand
resulted in the court room being filled
with the largest crowd this week and
It was an audience that rivaled those
of the early part of the trial. Mr.
Mitchell's cross examination was con
tinued this morning and was a strenu
ous one.
In the further direct examination or
Mrs. Lou Pierce counsel for Senator
jon4s brought out the fpet that it was
after she had told Senator Jones that
what she knew wouldn't help or hurt
anybody that the senator had remarked
in substance, "Your testimony before
the grand Jury doesn't amount to any
thing."
Continuing his cross examination
Mr. Mitchell asked: "Mr. Jones, as I
understand, did ask you what you tes
tified to in the grand Jury room?"
"Ye? sir," was the answer.
"What did you say?"
"I told him that what I testified to
Would help or hurt nobody." She said
she didn't tell Mr. Jones It was none
of his business what she had testified.

directed her to the auditor's office and
that she returned a few minutes later
when he had a conversation with her
about the three men she claims to have
ieen on the Saturday night before the
murder and on Sunday morning fol
lowing. (Mr. Greenlee said Mrs. Wil
lard had told him of seeing the three
strange men near the Moore house on
Saturday night.
"Did she further state she didn't
know these men?" Mr. Greenlee was
asked. He answered, "Yes, sir."
The witness also started that Mrs.
Willard had told of seeing wham she
thought were the same three men
about 10 o'clock Sunday morning in the
Moore neighborhood and that she did
not know them because it was a very
dark night Mr. Greenlee said he ask

QONORABLE PEACE
WOULD BE ACCEPTED
Chancellor Says Germany la Ready to
End War by Guarantee of Future of
Nation—Argyea Before Reiehatag in
Favor of Bill For Compulaory Service
of Civiliana For War Purpoaes—Saya
Lines Are Still Unbroken.
Berlin, Nov. 30.—In an address to the
rejehatag yesterday in introducing the
man power bill, Chancellor von Beth
mann-Hollweg again announced that
Germany was ready to end the war by
a peace guaranteeing the peace and
future of the nation.
In presenting the bill providing for
compulsory service of civilians for
war purposes the chancellor spoke of
the purposea. of the measure. It was
the chancellor's 60th birthday and bis
desk was decorated with flowers.
"•the %war continues," the chancellor
said. "Accordingly our' enemy desires
it They celebrated the paBt summer
as a period of victory. But did they
obtain what they wanted? Our lines
are unbroken and Roumania, thru
which a great change of events was
expected, is not atoning for what she
did. God has helped us up to the pres
ent. He will help us further.
"The almost superhuman herclsm of
our troops, which can not be expressed
in words of thanks, and our clear con
science, since we, the first and only
ones, were ready and are ready to end
the war by a peace guaranteeing our
existence and our future, they give us
moral rights to such confidence.
Enemies Do Not Desire Peace.
"But gentlemen, this right ought not
m^ke us forget our duty. Our enemies
do. not yet "desire peace. They have
superior numbers at their command
and'-«klmofat the whole world delivers
war material to them."
The ohanoellor urged the necessity
to do everything in Germany's power
In order to manufacture war material.
The bill, he continued, had been dis

to assist In the work which will bring
us net/ strength and guide us toward
victory and peace."
Munitions Paramount.
The war minister. Lieutenant Gen
eral von Stein, pointed out the para
mount role of war material during the
present conflict. He said the heroism
of the~ troops at the front imposed upon
every German at home the necessity of
providing the requisite materials, and
added:
"The enenmy has suffered appalling
losses from our artillery. For a long
time a very energetic French general
stood opposite my sector. We found
on .prisoners and on the dead docu
ments which mostly were incompre
hensible to us. From them we learned
how many death sentences were pass
ed by the general on his own soldiers.
"At the time of our victorious at
tacks on the much talked-of wire
hedge at Thiepval bend, where ma
chine guns were placed, the order was
given: "Whoever retreats will be shot'.
At the time of the attack on the
heights of Avocourt soldiers captured
stated they had received the order:
'Everyone who retreats wll-1 be shot.'
"To us such an order was incompre
hensible. The heroism and sense of
duty of our soldiers Justify our confi
dence that they never will be found
wanting even when fighting against
numerically superior forces."
