THE CHRISTMAS
WINDOWS AT
THE JIG STORE
The Christmas windows of tho
new Shamhart Christiansen store aro
without doubt the most oxqulstto y
er soen in Logan. It is worth a trip
to Logan-i3"se them.. On either side
of tint entrance, and covering the en
tire fndow bdokground aro lrrgo
oil paintings, "divided and held In
place by massive pillars ln bright
red, each ot thoso pillars support a
cast of Santa's smfllng face and tho
scroll along the top. is trimmed with"
a beautiful silver leaf vine. The ef
fect is artistic beyond b.pllef.
The design Is ouo worked out by
Mr. Christiansen and hisiolp at tho
store and Is striking. .BVidan.ce o'f tho
ongenulty of the member of this
progressive concern. The.tts'lntlngs
nre highly merltortous and Is the
work of Arthur Olson th'a, capable
salesman in , the. Shoe" department.
we supposea Ariuurs anility asiao
from selling shoes was confined -to
singing, We know hjs ability along
these lines but now we are forced
to concede that he is an artist as
well because they are not the least
amaturlsb, and may havo been sup
posed to havo como from the studio
of somo painter of landscapp scenes.
Tho merchandise trimming Is In ex
actly tho right tasto andjprpportton
and with tho now wax figures, to
show it, t Is porfecUon-jIn window
trimmings and would win a prize If
shown in Paris.
Tho interior of tho storo is equally
artistic and boautlfully decorated In
the Xmas colors. Largo poppies aro
used In profusion about tho storo and
rod festooning is draped from tho
lights and on tho walls and creates
ayoritablo riot., of cplorjjigtbnt Is
pleasing to tho eye. Tho only re
mark ono hears from visitors or
shoppers is, "Beautiful." Again wo
say it Is worth a trip to Logan to
see. All Logan is proud of It.

Mr. John H. Anderson's Talk
Iteported by Jennie Tobias, J tin. 4.
It being Utah Products week, Mr.
Anderson, a business man of Logan,
came to tho Lowell school ana gave
the seventh grade pupils a talk on
some of Utah's products and Indus
tries. His talk was similar to what fol
lows: Sixty eight years ago, when, the
nlnnnnm rnmn hara to TTtnh. this lnnri
Was nothing but a barren waste, but
tho pioneers worked at It, and work
ed at It, until now it is fine land,
producing 6,000,000 bushels of
wheat per year, worth at present
1 1.7 2 por bushel.
As'' early as IS 88 the canning in
dustry was tarted. The Utah Cann
ing Co. was the first one established
In Utah. Utah cans the best Bauer
kraut, catsups, and Plorce's Pork
and Beans are considered tho best.
, Thoro aro moro than 10,p00,000
cans of tomatoes canned .yearly and
many of these are sont to California,
because they havo such a good flav
or.
Tho Goddard PIcklo Factory at
Ogden makes all sortB of pickles and
sauer kraut.
Morgan and Davis counties can a
great ,many. peas of different variet
ies. The Ogden Packing Co. has recent
ly bulll a $300,000.00 addition to
their establishment. They kill, dross
and prepare 300 c.ittlo, 1000 sheep
and 1000 hogs daily.
Thero Is u now factory In Utah,
called Sunrlpo Cereal Company,
which manufactures breakfast foods
sucli ns, puffed wheat, etc. ln this
now factory thoy mako as good
breakfast foods ns wo can buy in tho
East.
In 1010 thero wero 373,351 people,
21.C7G of which wero farmers. Thcso
farmors must be sustained by tho
peoplo of Utah.
In 19K1 thero wero moro than
1100 Industrial establishments which
employed 1C.000. people, who got
$15,000,000 yearly.
Somo ot tho peoplo thought and
still think that there aro not moro
than ton artlclos maae In Utah. Thoy
aro therefore mistaken, because thoro
aro more than a hundred articles
mado here.
JENNIE TOBIAS.
Mr. Reynold's Talk.
Reported by Clnrn Turner.
Mr. Roynolds spoke on Utah Pro
ducts to somo of us eighth grado
students ot tho Lowell school, Nov
ember 22, 191C. Ho told us tho fol
lowing: The purposo ;ot having products
ln Utah Is to show the peoplo of this
locality what products aro grown and
what Is going on lu Utah.
It Is bolloved that moro. monoy Is
mado In Utah by tho growing of
sugar boots than any othor product.
Tlin.n nf nlilllt twnllTA Dllltnr f 11 r
torlos ln Utah and thoy aro now
thinking of constructing ono in
Trenton. Mnny mon and boys aro
omployeos In these factories.
A numbor of mercantile stores tn
this town havo had wonderful win
dow displays during tho past week
on Utah products. Prlzos wore award
od to thoso having tho best displays.
Tho first prlzo was awarded to tho
Weal Grocery, which was ton dollars.
Tho second to tho Economy Supply,
which was flvo dollars. Two stores,
tho City Grocery and II. G. Hay
ball's was n tie but by drawing cuts
tho prlzo was given to Hayballs and
tho City Grocery received honorable
mention.
Somo peoplo of this town and of
other towns In thla state sond to
largo firms out ot our stat for somo
of their needed goods Instead of pat
ronizing our homo merchants. It the
peoplo would patronize homo Indus
trie's by buying home' products it
t
would help the building of Utah and
the prosperity of tho peoplo.
Among the number of mon who
havo helped to make this state what
ltls are: C. E. Nlbloy, David Eccles
and J1, I. Bennett.
Tho knitting factories nro also
making much progress ln tho manu
facture of knitting goods. Thoso
having knitting factories ot this '
town are: Mr. Skldmore, Mr. Dork
man and Mr. Cardon. It Is said that
Cacho county is ono ot tho most Init
portant manufacturing counties ot
the state.
Mr. Rasmussen's Talk.
Reported by Jessie Know les.
Utah Products When tho pion
eers first came to Utah thoy wero
1,000 miles from n railroad and so
naturally they hnd to do thoir own
manufacturing. They had no mach
inery and manufacturing was very
hard, but later a railroad was
brought into Utah from tho East.
Tho small mills were now left ldlo
because the peoplo could got things
so much cheaper from tho cast than
thoy could manufacture themselves.
Men nnd boys ot Utah could not
ge, work nnd so had to start freight
ing ta Montana. Brlgham Young
who -wa"s-tho leader nnd governor of
Utah was disappointed In tho people,
ho know if this was kept up Utah
would never progress. He wont to
tho Legislature and asked them to
help him put up a sugar factory.
This was agreed, nnd through tho
donations of people thero was n sug
ar factory put up In Lehl, the first
ouo in Utah and a success.
In 1014 thoro was $1,200,000
paid for sugar boots and $150,000
for labor ln our sugar i.ictoilrs.
Mr. Rasmussen who furnished this
Information sa,id that ho went lo
Toxns in tho intoiest of tho Cacho
Fruit Growers' Association. "No-.v,"
ho said, "Whllo I was thoro I sc
on tho market Utah-Idaho sugar and
I inquired how much they paid for
It, nnd when I figured It out, we,
people hero In Logan paid slxty-flvo
cents more than ln Toxns," Ho re
marked that this ought to bo rem
edied somo way.
A mill In Wollsvllle was tho first
mill ln Cacho Vnlluv and when It
was openod thero wero often as many
ns thirty teams waiting for a grist.
Utah ships a great deal of Hour to
California and other coast states. Wo
peoplo in Utah pay twenty cents
less per hundred than people out of
Utnh pay for flour.
Tho woolen mills In Provo do not
provo a great financial succoss. But
ln Sears-Roobuck's catalogue thoro
Is a Provo blanket selling for $10,
and you can got that same blankot
hero for $7.50. Mr. Rasmussen's
talk was very Interesting and overy
ono enjoyed It.
Bishop Johnson's Talk.
Reported by Walton Cheney.
Rlbhop Johnson of tho Economy
Supply Co. gavo this talk at tho
Lowell Juulor High School ln room
throe. Room two was also prosont.
Bishop Johnson gavo us this talk on
Wednosday at nlno-flfteou, Novem
ber 22, 191C.
Ho said that in tho year 1911 thero
wero olovon hundred factories in
Utah. Thoso factories employed
olghteon thousand mo nnnd womon
a year. Thoy wero paying thoso em
ployees fifteen million dollars por
year. Thoy also paid thirty-five mil
lion dollars to tho farmors for raw
material, Thoso factorlos would fall
In business If tho people ot Utah did
not trade with thorn. Thoy could not
nnd ennnot run ln opposition with
tho factories ln tho East If tho peo
ple of Utah do not trade with them.
Thore are reasons for us to trado
with factorlos ln our own cities or
