Turkey Long and Favorably
Known for Its Delicious
Edible Qualities.
WORSHIPED BY THE AZTECS
When Introduced Into England They
Were Considered One of the
Richest Items at a Ban
quet—Many Varieties
of the Bird.
SENOR DON TUR
keT played a
brilliant part In
history even he
fore the Spanl
given place of
honor at (lie marriage banquet of a
king. So superior a viand was he con
sidered when first introduced to Eu
rope that in a "constitution” set forth
by Cranmer in 1514 turkey Is named
as one of the greater fowls, of which
an ecclesiastic was to “have but one
in a dishe.” But he speedily multi
plied to such un extent that no later
than 1555 two turkeys and four tur
key chicks w>re served at a feast of
the sergeants-at-arms in London.
Turkeys at that period were men
tioned in connection with cranes and
swans as important and rich items of
a banquet. A little later, in 1573, tur
key were used on the tables of Eng
lish husbandmen for the Christmas
feast. In tlu* meantime they were
more than plentiful in their home land,
where turkey continued to sell for
about six cents apiece as late as the
nineteenth century. For six cents In
those good old days a turkey weighing
about 12 pounds could be bought by
a good shopper. If the family need
ed a turkey weighing 25 or 30 pounds
It was necessary to pay ns much as a
quarter. But it must he remembered
that six cents in those days counted u
good deal more than it does in tills.
Turkeys of Various Kinds.
The turkey that the Aztecs wor
shiped was probably either the Mexi
can wild turkey, which is known by
tlie white touches on its tail coverts
and quills, or, more appropriately, the
ocellated turkey of Honduras and
other parts of South America, whose
brilliant plumage, spotted almost us
gloriously wllh vivid colors as u pea
cock, somehow allies it particularly
with that vivid early people. The tur
key which Strolled out of the forests
of New England and furnished so mar
velous a banquet for our Puritan fore
fathers was a handsomer bird than
that of Mexico, In the opinion of some
lovers of beauty, hut not so brilliant
a one as the Honduras turkey.
The American wild turkey, which
really belongs to Thanksgiving, was
the North American wild turkey
found throughout the eastern United
States and Canada. Scientifically it Is
known as the Mcleagris Americana.
Its plumage Is blapk, shaded w’lth
bronze. In the rays of the sun the
bird gleams In a beautiful harmony of
black copper, gold and bronze. And the
turkey likes the rays of the sdn. He
hates damp weather, not alone because
It Is bad for his health, but because
it obscures his bdauty.
It is generally believed at present
that all Urn turkeys of the world have

descended from the throe forms known
as tlu* North American bird, which has
just boon described; the Mexican nird
and the ocollated bird.
Credit May Belong to Spaniards.
The turkey which was first intro
duced into Europe may have boon car
ried there by the Spaniards from Mex
ico or the Jesuits may have taken it
back across the waters from one of
their scattered stations in the great
woods of Canada. In any event one
of its representatives figured at the
marriage banquet of Charles I\ and
was regarded as of sufficient impor
tance to be mentioned in the reports
of that festivity.
The Mexican turkey is the wild bird
of Mexico, which also came over the
line into the southern part of the
United States. Mcleagris Gallopava
Is the name that is generally employed
to describe tins turkey. It is some
what shorter in the shank than the
northern species. Its body color is
a metallic black, shaded with bronze.
This is thought to be tin* species that
the early navigators first bore back
to Spain and England. The white tips
of its plumage also have suggested
that it is to this bird rather than to
the wild turkey ot North America
that most of the domestic fowls owe
their origin.
The ocellated turkey, Mcleagris Orel
lata, which is smaller than the oth
ers, has a bare head and neck. Its
body plumage is bronze and green,
banded with gold bronze and varied
with spots or eyes of brilliant colors—
blue, red and brilliant black.
Why Is a Turkey So Named?
Why the turkey is culled the tur
key when its origin is admittedly pure
ly occidental is a subject that lias puz
zled many persons. There are several
reasons given by those who have
delved deeply into this problem, and
one is privileged to take ids choice.
In the first place, it is stated that tho
turkey was originally supposed to
have come from Asia. Thus at a
time when great stretch of territory
on the Asiatic continent was called
"Turkey” the bird derived its name
from its supposed origin. Another
speculative chronicler records that the
Indians culled the bird "tirkee" and
that from tlds its common name was
created. Then, again, it is somewhat
generally believed that the bird named
itself by its peculiar utterances, which
are still translated us "turk-turk
turkee,” Again, still more subtle philos
ophers have traced the naming of
the bird to its Muship in the matter
of polygamous habits with tlie Turks
and there are other explanations.
The pilgrims were not so bad oft
In some ways as we have been led to
imagine, for although they were de
prived of the joys of tinned meats and
vegetables and cold storage and sim
ilar blessings turkeys were so plenti
ful that it Is recorded it was custom
ary to refer to them us bread. An
other chronicler sets forth the fact
that the breast of the wild turkey
when cooked in butter was esteemed
by even the epicures among the ex
plorers. Hut In spite of their alum
dance turkeys were regarded with fa
vor even by the red men, if one is to
judge by the following prayer which
they uttered:
“Oh great Being, f thunk thee that
I have obtained the use of my legs
again so that I am able to walk about
and kill turkeys."
Choose Thankfulness.
Thankfulness Is not the inevitable
result of certain conditions, but a mut
ter of deliberate choice. It Is a mis
take to tell ourselves that we should
be thankful if we possessed this or
that, for possession has little or noth
ing to do with thankfulness.
Be thankful. Do not waste any
time arguing whether or not you nave
any reason for it. Lift your heart to
the Father of us all In reverent grati
tude, and in the mere net of thankful
ness you will realize your blessings as
never before.

Harvest and Peace
By DOUGLAS MALLOCH
Not only for the harvest yield
We stripped from stalks in serried
ranks
We look across the quiet field
And raise the anthem of our thanks.
The moonlight lies along the hilt
Below a silver river flows —■
And all the night is sweet and still.
And all the land in calm repose. *
Not only for the bounteous store
Of garnered grain we offer praise.
But for the quiet sea and shore.
The nights of rest, the pleasant days.
As year by year our acres bloom.
As year by year our flocks increase.
Afar from war and war’s red gloom.
We look upon a land at peace.

L had assured her that
the tiling was as good as accomplished,
only of course it would take time and
she must be very, very quiet. “For,”
he explained, “you have ns many dif- 1
ferent expressions us have the clouds |
themselves, and of course I cannot ;
paint them all. So you must lix your ;
eyes and mind upon one thing, that i
your expression may always remain i
the same.” Whereat Charmette, being j
very much in love with Billy, fastened :
both upon him and her expression was j
a happy one indeed. Then when he
would lay his brush aside with a lit- ;
tie weary sigh and tell her that they
were through for the sitting, site would
came hopping off her pillowed divan
and running behind him rest her chin
upon the top of ids head as she puck
ered her lips anil solemnly criticized
herself upon the canvas.
“And do I really look like that,
Billy?” she would half whisper while
he was slipping an arm around her
slim waist. Whereat he would say:
“Yes, dear —only of course much
prettier. But I will bring that fact
out as I go along.” So Charmette would
tidy things up a hit as lie washed his
hands, then away they would go chat
tering like sparrows about the won
derful time so soon to come when Billy
would he of ago and receive his heri
tage in America, for when that day
came they were to he married and he
was to take her hack to his own land.
“And it happens to be next Thanks
giving,” lie told her; then explained
what the term meant to those horn In
Ids country across the sea. For Char
mette, being a Belgian girl, had never
heard of it until the coming of Billy.
And then came the dark time when
Paris stilled and grew pale and the
very ground seemed to quiver beneath
the tread of the advancing legions.
Her Expression Was a Happy One
Indeed.
Through Belgium they came pounding I
in the vastest machine ever built by
man as they smashed her great
fortresses like anthills beneath a jug
gernaut and swept over her la a
great tide, rolling the defenders be
fore them as a wave rolls before the
prow of a ship. And in those terrl- '
hie hours the hand of Billy left his
brush and sought that of Charmette (
as they sat with faces turned east
ward searching the sky for the rings
of shell smoke which they knew must I
soon float in the air in grim banquets
of death. Then It was that one morn
ing the girl came to him with a let
ter In her hand and tears flooding her
blue eyes.
“They have destroyed my home, and
my old father and mother are outcasts.
1 must go to them. Good-by, Billy,”
she sobbed. He kissed her.
“But of course 1 shall go with you.”
She only pushed him away, pointing to
a regiment of red-trousered soldiers
that was hurrying to the front.
“No. For two years you received
a military training in your own coun
try. Tomorrow you must Join the army
of France.”
“But you—” he pleaded, and broke
down. She returned his kiss.
“If we are both alive we will find
each other upon your great day of
Thanksgiving ten weeks away. And
until then —” But there Is no need
of going into their parting, for the last
words of love are sacred. However,
three days later site was in Belgium
and he was marching and counter
marching in that wonderful unknown
army which even the eagle eyes of the
enemy’s spies had not discovered; the
army of minute men which lay hidden
behind Paris.
Came the day when the hot breath
of advancing hosts was in the very
face of the great capital upon the
Seine. In companies, regiments, bat
talions and divisions they came in an
endless martial sea, sweeping the le
gions of the tri-color before them miles
each day. And then It was that the
great French general sprang his trap.
In cars, buses, automobiles and by
every means which Ingenuity could de
vise, the secret army from behind the
city was rushed to the front. Billy,
in the midst of it, heard the rumble
and grumble of the buttle from miles
away, and scenting it felt the hair on
the back of his head bristle ns It
does upon a dog when he smells a
wolf. Then in a great surge there
swept over him the thought of Char
mette, and tears blinded him ns he
imagined her so slender and helpless
wandering hornelessiy In her desolate
country; and with It a longing vast
i and unutterable to throw down his
| gun and go rushing blindly away in
i search of her that he might take her
[ in Ids arms and bear her away from
till this hell to the ponce and happi
ness that had been theirs through the
long summer when the days hud fallen
softly as thistledown. God! how he
hated it all —this war and blood and
heartbreaks. And then without know
ing wiiy, ho suddenly found himself
rushing forward into a gray murk with
thousands of his companions on either

band, a fierce yell bursting from his
lips and the battle lust turning him
hot as a flame ns he realized that they
were charging.
Dimly he was conscious of showers
of invisible things that passed him
in hurtling (light. Huge clouds of
dust arose on all sides and where there
laid been level ground suddenly
yawned great pits; thunderous explo
sions deafened him and he staggered
before the impact of blows of com
pressed air. On every side men and
horses were going down in groups, in
heaps, In whole windrows like wheat
before hail. Before him In a clump
of trees was something that belched
and roared like a dragon, and before
his scattered senses told him that it
was a battery he found himself in a
wild bayonet conflict with a pule
halrcd young man who wore a spiked
helmet, and almost at the mouth of the
belching monster of the brush. Then
as they thrust and parried, suddenly
tlie fair-haired man went down and
Billy leaped on, not knowing what had
made the other full, yet vaguely con
scious that his bayonet ran red. Then
u great darkness engulfed him.
It was evening and he was lying
upon tlie bank of a stream that ran
close by his old home. At his side
tlie brook was tinkling like bells and
the coolness of Its waters was upon
his face. Lord, but he was thirsty, and
rolling over he hurled his face in the
ripples and drank interminably. Then
as he turned upon his buck again a
pain shot through his head, and some
one whom he could not see, but who
was close by him, began whimpering
like a hurt puppy. Endlessly the whim
perings continued, until, unable to en
dure them longer, he sat up and rough-
I iy bade the compialner cease his noise.
| And as he did this tlie fog was swept
from his brain and he found himself
lying In the debris of a battle-swept
i wood with the noise of the conflict still
j coming to him from afar. A fright
ful pain stabbed his brain and from
his dry throat burst a weak moan, and
then it was that he realized that it had
been his own voice which had been
whimpering. Then all grew dark once
more.
■ For what seemed an eternity he 11s-
I toned to unseen persons whispering
about him, while slowly, very slowly
the darkness lifted. Came a day
when he opened his eyes. He was ly
ing In a clean hospital with rows of
other cots on every side. Once more
his head was clear, but upon him was
the weakness of long illness. A nurse
with a red cross upon her arm passed
his way, stopped before him and
smiled.
“And so your mind has awakened at
last,” she said softly. “It has been
many weeks. For a long time we
feared you would die, but it seems that
you are to get well."
“And where am I?” be managed to
say.
“In Paris. This Is the hospital tor
wounded Americans. And by the way,
a friend has been awaiting your awak
enlng for several days. 1 will bring
her."
But she had no time to bring. Down
the aisle a girl came running to throw
herself upon her knees by his bedside
“Oh, Billyl Billy!" She Cried.
clasping his thin hands within her
own and raining kisses upon bis
cheeks.
“Oh, Billyl Billy 1" she cried. “And
I found you the first day. Listen,
dear. The enemy is defeated and
Paris is saved—and you helped do it.
And you are to fight no more, and we
can now go to that great country of
yours, where all is peace and happiness.
And the picture, Billy, the picture.
You will laugh when you see the care
with which I have safeguarded it.”
He drew her to him until her cheek
rested against his own.
“Yes, dearest. And when we had
thought nil was over life was just be
ginning. Isn’t it wonderful?" He
paused, then spoke again.
“What day is this, Charmette?” She
laughed Joyously.
“It is all days in one; the day of
your inheritance; the day of your
birth; (he day of our marriage—your
marvelous Thanksgiving."
He relaxed upon his pillows and a
smile came creeping over his face.
“Jolly old Thanksgiving," he whis
pered.

DAY MEANT FOR MEDITATION
At Thanksgiving Time One Should
Weigh His Motives and Ability to
Help His Fellow Men.
The true meaning of a national
Thanksgiving day is often misunder
stood. To some It is merely a day for
bugging a few quails, squirrels, or oth
er wild game. To others It Is a day to
Indulge in some recreation and enjoy
a square meal. To some'it Is a day
for recounting our material gain over
our less fortunate brothers during the
fleeting year. There are other various
notions as to the real purpose of a
Thanksgiving day each year.
Whatever may be the Ideal purpose
of a real Thanksgiving day, It should
bo one as full as possible of good
cheer, but to employ the day in re
counting our material achievements —
gains and losses—is a sin with the
blackest kind of complexion. The true
meaning of Thanksgiving means no
more than the duty which each indi
vidual owes to the Creator every day
in the year. It is a day when each
person should weigh his motives along
with his ability to help his fellow man
in his own Individual way, and to re
turn thanks for not only the goodness
which has befallen him, but to pledge
with it an effort to strive to be a great
er blessing to the community in which
he lives, than any previous year.—ex
change.
PREPAREDNESS
The Best Blessing.
We need to be on our guard at the
Thanksgiving season against an ex
aggeration of the importance of mere
ly material benefits. A big yield of
corn or wheat is not to be compared
in weighing our national blessings,
with an awakened public conscience.
Added material comforts in the home
are insignificant alongside of a new
sympathy and understanding between
the different members of the family.
It is well to thank God for bountiful
harvests and comfortable homes, but
let our best gratitude be kept for the
higher things, the blessings of the

NEW POLICY NEEDED
IN GOVERNMENT
RAILWAY CONTROL
Helpfulness and Encouragement
Urged by Alfred P. Thom. -
CREDIT MUST BE IMPROVED
Increase of Transportation Facilities
Necessary to Secure Relief From
High Cost of Living May Thus Be
Provided For by the Railroads.
Washington, Nov. 28.—A new policy
of government railroad regulation,
bast'd on constructive principles of
helpfulness ami encouragement instead
of upon principles of repression and
punishment, was urged by Alfred P.
Thom, counsel for the Railway Execu
tives’ Advisory Committee, the first
witness on behalf of the railroads be
fore tile Newlands Joint Committee on
Interstate Commerce, \\ lib h lias Insti
tuted a general inquiry Into the prob
lems of railroad regulation.
“It is proposed by the joint resolu
tion of Congress.” said Mr. Thom, “to
go Into a comprehensive study of the
whole subject of transportation, to
make a new assessment, after 2!i years
of experiment, of Its history, its pres
ent conditions and Its future needs.
The railroads accept the view that reg
ulation is a permanent and enduring
part of government in America and
that the first duty of the curriers Is to
the public. That duty is to afford
reasonable facilities on reason aide
terms and at reasonable rates, and this
must lie done before any private Inter
ests can be considered."
Certainty, Safety and Sufficiency.
Mr. Th mu contended that the real In
terest of tlie public is in being assured
of certainty, safety and sufficiency of
transportation facilities, rather than tn
rates. consideration of the
public Is to obtain transportation facili
ties. What the cost Is, Is In reality a
second consideration, he said.
Mr. Thom proposed an Increase of
transportation facilities as a method
of securing relief from the high cost
of living, “There have been less than
I.OPO miles of new railroad construct
ed In the United States during the past
year." he said, "less Ilian in any year
since is is, except the period of the
Civil War. and yet the cost of living is
dally advancing owing to a shortage of
supplies which might be remedied by
securing access to new areas of pro
duction.
Credit Must Be Improved.
"Tills lends to the consideration ns to
whether railroad credit Is as good as
the public interest requires, it Is im
possible for railroads to earn enough
to supply tli(> necessary new facilities
from current revenue. They must lie
provided from credit. Investors can
not lie coerced, but must be attracted.”
Among flic conditions affecting rail
road credit which deter investors he
mentioned the following:
"First. Railroad revenues are not
controlled by investors, but are fixed
and limited by governmental authority
and not by one but by several govern
mental authorities, which do not recog
nize responsibility for assured results
to Investors and are uncoordinated.
“Second, Railroads cannot control
and tlu government cannot and does
not limit (lie expense account.
“Third, The present system of regu
lation is based on a pulley of regulation
and correction and not on a i>oltcy of
helpfulness and encouragement.
“Fourth. The outstanding obligations
of the railroads have already exceeded
the financial rule of safety and Involve
a disproportionate amount of obliga
tions hearing fixed charges.
“Fifth, The Investor must accept a
subordinate obligation or security with
no assurance of a surplus of earnings
to support it.
"Sixth, Other competitive Hues of in
vestment present superior attractions.
“Seventh, The railroad business Is
largely controlled by iHilitlcal Instead
of business considerations.
Look Forward, Not Back.
"We may debate about what has
caused the present conditions,” said
Mr. Thom, "but we cannot debate about
what tiie people need. The President
has taken the view that we must look
forward In this matter and make a
fresh assessment of circumstances’ in
order to deal helpfully and Intelligent
ly with the problem. Abuses are
no more prevalent In the railroad busi
ness today than in any other business
humanely conducted. The great ques
tion now Is whether the existing sys
tem of regulation gives the public re
liable assurance of sufficient preseut
and future railroad facilities.
“Those who oppose any change must
make their appeal on (he ground that
the present systems assure tlie public
of the continued adequacy of trans
portation facilities. If they do not, no
argument based on the desirability of
the present dual system of regulation
will be accepted by public judgment.
The question of ‘states’ rights’ is not
involved. If tiie regulation of transpor
tation facilities privately owned should
fall government ownership must fol
low, and then all power of the states
over tiie railroads would disappear.
“Let us debate this question, then,
not upon any mere theory or jealousy
as to the distribution of governmental
power, but upon the large issue of
what the public Interest requires in
respect of the assurance of adequate
transportation service."
