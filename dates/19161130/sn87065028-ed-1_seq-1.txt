ANNUAL CONFERENCE BE
GAN SESSION AT Wl
NONA YESTERDAY.
BISHOP MURRAH
IS PRESIDING
Rev. J. M. Carpenter Probably
Only Local Minister Who
Will Leave.
The North Mississippi Conference
of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
South, began its annual meeting at
Winona yesterday, and will remain
in session until next Monday. The'
assignments of pastorates is always
the last work undertaken, and the
ministers will not know positively
where they are to be sent next year
until just before adjournment.
All three of the local ministers,
Dr. W. W. Woollard, presiding elder
of the Columbus district, Rev. W. L.
Duren, pastor of the First Methodist
church, and Rev. J. M. Carpenter,
pastor of the Central Methodist
church, are attending the conference.
It is believed that Dr. Woollard and
Mr. Duron will retain their respec
tive charges, as, under the rule of the
conference which limits the work of
a minister to four years in a single
field, each still has one year to serve
lure. It is known, however, tfrat Mr.
Carpenter will not return, aa he has
already announced that ho intends to
resume his tiieologicr.l studies at Har
vard University. , Mr. Carpenter has
l.uitij the Central church a most ef
ficient pastor, and his departure is
resrettod not oniy by members of
the congregation but by Columbians
generally. There i3 no information
r.t hand upon which to bnse a predic
tion as to who. his swcVsrof will be.
The conferees is beiny: presided
over by ' Bishop W. 13. Murrah, of
Jackson, who spent a portion of hi
boyhood in Lowndes county, and who
has hundreds of friends here.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
HAS PLAN WITH THAT
END IN VIEW. .
WILL PAY PART OF
SALARY DEMANDED
Scheme Will Be Placed Before
Board of Supervisors for
Consideration.
If a plan recently devised by the
Chamber of Commerce reaches frui
tion agriculturists in this section will
soon have an expert to give them ad
vice and assistance regarding diversi
fication and other farm problems, as
it is the intention of the Jivic Cham
ber to make one more effort to secure
a local county demonstrator.
Directors of the Chamber of Com
merce have had the matter under
consideiatior. for some time, and
have at last worked out a plan which
they believe to be thoroughly practi
cable. This plan provides for the
employment of a man to act in the
dual capacity of farm demonstratoif
and secretary of the Civic Chamber,
and the Chamber will, of course, py
a portion of his salary. The Federal
government has provided a fund out
of which a portion of the salaries of
country demonstrators r.ro paid, and
the only thing necessary to insurcj
the f uccess of the scheme is to inuuee
the board of supervisors to fro in on
the scheme and agree to bear a por
tion of the expense.
Several counties ri different sec
tions of the stale have adopted plans
tiiiiilar to the one outlined above, avl
in every instance satisfactory results
have been attained. Prof. E. R. Lloyd
of the A."&' M. College, who has
charge cf, the- disbursement in this
stato of funds provided by the Fed
oral government to aid iiu:itics in
paying the salaries of demonstrators,
lias promised the directors of the
Chamber of Commerce his hearty co
operation, and it is hoped and be
lieved that the plan can be success
fully consummated.

Revihsky, the nceuscd, displayed
no emotion during the ftorning ns
he sat behind his counsel, Robert H.
PreJcott. He occasionally smiled at
some humorous remark of a witness,
hut for the most part he sat with
sole. face, looking straight ahead,
and with the four-fingered left hand
bmijd in his right.
The leading 'witness at the morn
ing session before Jud'ie Harsh, who
heard the cs.e in the first criminal
couit-oom, was J. A. Morton, chief
cf polite of Columbus Miss., who ar
rested Iievinsky there on Oct. 2i). He
told of capturing llevinsky late in the
afternoon under a negro church, in
the edge of tovn, after he had been
discovered a few minutes earlier in
the belfry of the church by the sex

on trial for his life, he broke into a

sion held last week ,for the purpose
of trying Rome criminal cases which

but which were not disposed of on
account of the fact that the term was

There was no morning session on

methodical and orderly manner that
business is being rapidly disposed. He

Huntsville, Ala., Nov. 2'J. Iavid
Overton must pay the death penalty
for the murder of Probnte Judge W.
T. Lawler, which occurred in Hunt-
ville June 14, 1916. The foreman of
the jury trying the case read the ver
dict in the Madison county court
room shortly after 1 1 :30 Tuesdav
morning and Judge Miller decreed
that he must die by hanging January
12, 1917.
Notice of appeal to the suprem
court was given by the defense im
mediately after the verdict was ren
dered, and the sentence is suspended
temporarily, awaiting the decision in
regard to an appeal.
Shortly after 1 1 :30 twelve grim
faced jurors filed into the courtroom.
The place was silent as a tomb. Even
tho rain outside seemed to abate as
the lips of the foreman began to
move and he read: "We, the jury,
find the defendant guilty of murder
in the first degree."
Immediately thereafter the court
pronounced the penalty, and the fato
of Overton was learned.
There was no demonstration. The
spectators heard the verdict in si
lence. When the verdict was returned
there were not as many spectators in
the room ns had witnessed the trial
throughout the week. Extra deputies
guarded the doors, but apparently
this precaution was unnecessary as
peace and quiet prevailed following
tiie reading of the verdict.
Judge Miller asked Overton if
there was anything lie wished to say
mid his reply was "nothing, Judge,
except that I am not guilty." The
verdict was signed by Leader Reese,
foreman.

The many friends here of Mrs.

That wrapping twines which give
thorough satisfaction can be made
from paper ha ; been demonstrated
by the experiments made by the For
est Products Laboratory at Madison,
Wis. Several hundred packages,
each containing a medium sized book,
were wrapped and fastened with the
lightest weight paper twine and were
mailed to various points throughout
the Urnted States. Reports show
that practically every package was
received in good order and that in
no case was there any damge which
could be charged as a fault of tKe
twine. In making twine the paper is
cut into strips which are then twisted
tightly to form a cord. The strength
of the twine depends upon the char-.
acter of the paper used and the pro
cess of treatment. It is well adapted
to a number of purposes, but the
foresters say that as yet no satisfac
tory means has been found for pro
tecting the paper twine from the ac

used for purposes where it will be
exposed to moisture.
