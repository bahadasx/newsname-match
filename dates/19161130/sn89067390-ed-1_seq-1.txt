To my Friends:
According to the face ol

Russell's plurality. . . .1165
More than 15,000 more votes were
cast in this election for candidates for
Congress in this District than in 1914.
Mr. Russell's plurality is smaller this
year than in 1914, in proportion to the
total vote cast.
My own county, Butler, i the only
County that has the - distinction of in
creasing her Republican majority by
300. That is gratifying, indeed; in
fact, I am grateiul for every vote re
ceived and lake this opportunity to
thank everyone who assisted in my
cimpaign.
I'll not be a candidate in the next
campaign and in fact, never expect to
be a candidate for pulic office again,
but I now predict the election of a
Republican Congressman in this Dis
trict next election.
In conclusion, I want to assure the
people of this District that I have no
enemies to punish and more friends
turn I ever can reward, and
when I can be of service to any
of you, command me.
Sincerely yours,
David w. Hill.

Rotation vs Manure For Corn
In one of the experiments at the
I Missouri Agricultural Experiment Sta
I tion corn has been grown for twenty
I five rears on the same plot of ground
with an application of manure averag
ing about seven tons annually. In
comparison with this, corn has been
grown in various rotations without ma
nure. A summary of the yields for
the last six years on these plots shows
that the average yield of corn on the
rotated plots shows that the average
yield of corn which has been grown
continuously with Manure. In other
words rotation has been somewhat
better than heavy mauuring in this ex
periment. The last six years of the
quarter century have been chosen for
comparison since one of the rotations
is a six-year rotation and since this
number of years is sufficient to largely
overcome seasonal variations.
It should not be understood from
these results that rotation is sufficient
to maintain the yield of corn. As a
matter ol fact there are other plots in
in this same experiment which have
been both rotated and manured. The
average yield sof these plots is very
materially above rotation alone. The
important points are, that rotation is
more important than fairly heavy ma
nuring in the long tun, but that is net
all-sufficient; that in order to maintain
land in productiveness economically,
it should be both rotated and manured,
while in many cases commercial feitil"
izing materials applied in addition to
the manure will give still further re
turn. M. F. Miller, Missouri College
of Agriculture.
Top Dressing of Wheat Land
Every year sees a greater number of
Missouri farmers using manure as a
top dressing on wheat. There is con
siderable evidence to show where
wheat is grown in a rotation, manure
can very often be applied to better ad
vantage as a top dressing on this crop
thin as an application belore corn.
There are two principal advantages ol
this practice. The fust one is that it j
greatly stimulates the growth of the
wheat and helps to prevent winter!
kiiling with a resulting increase in
yield. The second cne is that since
clover and grass are usually sown with
the wheat and sipce manure aids very 1
greatly in securing a stand of these '
crops when used as a top dressing with
the wheat, this alone may be sufficient
reason for its application. As a mat
ter of fact the top dressing of wheat i
with manure almost insures a stand of:
clover or grass on land is at all suited
to these crops. The land may be too
sour or too wet to grow clover. Much I
land in Missouri is too sour. If it is
only slightly sour, the manure greatly
aids in getting a clover stand. If it is
very sour, lime is usually essential in
addition. M. F. Miller, Missouri
College of Agriculture.

Resolutions adopted
We desire to thank the school Board
for the use of the school building.
We thank the citizens of F'orsyth
for their hospitality.
We thank our County Superintend
ent for the interest he has been, and
is taking in trying to advance and
build up the educational interests
of the county.
We retnrn our most grateful thanks
to the speakers who have taken part
with us in our program, and especially
Prof. W. Y. Foster of The Springfield
Normal School, Mr. T. J. Walker of
the State Department of Education,
and Supt. W. W. Thomas of Spring
field. President Missouri State Teach
eis' Association.
We heartily approve the spelling
contests held in the county this year,
and while we think a better contest to
obtain, we recommend that more of
the teachers take interest in said con"
tests, to the end that every district
may be represented in the preliminary
meetings, and that at our meeting
next year we may if possible have a
bigger and better contest.
Whereas; we realize the necessity of
better physical training for the youth
of this pait of the country, and recog
nize it as a part of the work in connec
tion with the schools, and a part of the
true education.
Therefore, be it resolved; that we
indorse the plan of orr County Super
intendent for a County Athletic meet,
and pledge to him our support, and
i that we will ei-deivor to enter the pu
! pils of schools in the various event of
the meet.
Whereas, we believe that the edu
cational work of the state is greatly
hindered and hancicapped by our
present Constitution, and that the fund
amental work of the state; namely
the education of all her citizens is an
imprsi'iility. because cf the unen.ucal
distribution of wealth.
Tacrefore be it resolved that we

Cutting Food Bills in H;;lf.
Onco ii(.'ain tho serious chartfo of
waste has been laid against tho Ameri
can housekeeper. Senator Smoot Bays
our :arbag(! can is the largest in tho
world.
Regarding waste, wo must remem
ber that tho American palate differs
from the European, where tho house
wife in ii'.cre frugal, observes the Hos
ton (I'.olie. We like the best cuts of
meats with simple seasoning. If wo
relished the less expensive cuts, which
are tho waste from tho best cuts, and
could eat these with high seasoning,
thero would bo not so much wasto.
An Italian or French family could
livo on what a well-to-do American
family throws away. Tho European
housewifo would know how to ruako
tasty what la left over. That la why
wo waste more.
An American family onco hired an
Italian as cook. He also did all tho
marketing, which, with tho advent of
tho telephone, is rapidly becoming an
other lojt art of tho American house
wife. It was found that tho Italian
cook reduced tho family's food bills
00 per cent.
To Repair Damaged Mirror.
To restore, a mirror from which tho
silver backing has conns oiT in spots,
proceed as follows: First remove
tho silvering from tho glass around
t lie scratch so that tho clear epaco
will bn about a quarter of an inch
wide. Thoroughly clean tho clear
space with a clean cloth and alcohol.
Near the edge of a broken pieco of
looking glass mark out a pieco of sil
vering a littlo larger than the space
on tho mirror; place a tery nilnuto
drop of mercury in tho center cf this
patch and allow it to remain thero for
a few minutes; clear away tho silver
ing around tho patch and siido tho
latter from tho glass. I'laco it over
tho clear spot on tho mirror and gent
ly press it down with a tuft of cottou.
Tin's is a dillicult operation, and wo
would adviso a littlo practice before
trying it on a largo mirror.
