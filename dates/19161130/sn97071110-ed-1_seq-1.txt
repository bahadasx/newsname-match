ENORMOUS APPLE;
CROP HARVESTED
16 MILE TRAIN WOULD BE REQUIRED
7,200,000 Feet of Lnmber Used in Boxes
21 Carloads of Paperd 40
Tons'ot Nails Used
Literally speaking, the town of Hoed
River is fairly bursting with apples.
I he cold rooms of storage planta have
been filled Uncapacity 'andjaisles and
areawaya bave been piled to the ceil
ing with tier after tier of bulging box
es. Every .available vacant""Bpace in
the city ia being loaded "with fruit. The
basements of business blocks, empty
amusement halls and storerooms and a
vacated parlor of a funeral director
bave been turned into apple receiving
stationa and now give forth the fra
grant aroma of the Spitzenburg, the
Newton and the Northern Spy,
And atill the wagons of growers in
long files daily unload their burdens of
luscious fruit. Practically every sec
tion of the town's business district
during the daylight hours and until late
in the evening presents scenes typical
of the produce and commission quarters
of large cities. Store fronts, the win
dows of which may display tobaccos or
candies, socks or shirts, or the product
of a grocer, are partially obscured at
timea by the piled up heaps of fruit
boxs. Business men, merchants and
professional men are assisting in every
manner in the protection of the great
apple crop. The Apple ia now truly
King in Hood River.
Even at this late date the estimiates
of the 1916 yield of fruit coninuea to
swell. The Hood River apple crop is
now conservatively placed at 1,600,000
boxes of fruit, and officials of sales
agencies eay that at a minimum figure
of 1,200,000 boxes of commercial varie
ties and grades have been packed for
distribution.
The magnitude of the 1916 Hood
River apple crop may be grasped when
it ia announced that a total of more
than 6,000 men, women and children
were needed in the harvest. The great
quantity of fruit may be further com
prehended when furher statisitca gath
ered on the material used in packing
the fruit, ia digested.
While the minimum quantity of ap
ples loaded on a refrigerator car is 630
boxes, because bf shortage of freezers
this season, an average of approxi
mately 700 boxes will be Bhipped in
each car. When the season is ended,
it will have required 1,714 cars to han
dle the apple crop. A refrigerator car,
from croupier to coupler, measures ap
proxiately 60 feet. A solid train car
rying all of the packed apples of the
Hood River valley would reach a dis
tance of approximately 16 miles, about
one-fourth the distance from Hood
River to Portland.
Every apple shipped from Hood Riv
er, packed in one of the three gradse
extra fancy, fancy or C grade requires
a paper wrapper. Each box requires
two sheets of lining paper and three
sheets of layer cardboard. Twenty-one
carloads of paper were the require
ments for the 1916 crop.
Figuring six feet to the box, a total
of 7.200.000 feet of lumber were used
in making apple boxes this year. Each
box requires in the making 32 cement
nails, of which there are 39,000 to the
keg' Approximately 1,000 kegs, or
40 ton of these nails were driven into
the boxes. The boxes cost growers an
average of 10 centa each, the total
outlay being 180,000.
The total Northwestern apple crop is
figured at an approximate 20.000 cars,
or 14,000,000 boxes. Statistical data
on the entire crop may be obtained,
approximately, by multiplying Hood
Kiver figures by 17.
SPOKANE CONGRESS
FAVORS UNIFORMITY
At the concluding session of the
Pacific Northwest Fruit Growers' con
ference Saturday, the joint commission
appointed by the governor of Oregon,
Washington, Idaho and Montana was
instructed by the growers to work for
uniform laws in the four states con
cerning apple diseases,, grading ana
packing, and to endeavor to ootain a
system of state aid for marketing en
terprises under state control.
The instructions were adopted by a
three-fifths vote after a sharp contest
between advocates of federal and state
control. The government control forc
es, which were defeated, were headed
by E. W. Koss, of North Yakima, wn.,
former Washington State Land Com
miesoner. Opposition to uniform grading rules
applying to all parts of the state was
voiced bv ueoree Bienn. or jNortn iaa-
ima, who declared that the growers of
the Yakima valley objected to tne color
requirement for Jonathan apples, be
cause Bales in the early part of the
season, before the apples had taken on
full color, were prevented. A. f.
Bateham. of Hosier. Ore., and A. C.
Allen, of Medford, Ore., protested
sgainst relaxing atandards, Mr. Allen
declaring that a district which could
not grow an apple meeting standard
requirements should drop that variety
Mr. Ross asserted that it was ridicu
lous to apeak of uniform fruit laws for
four atates.
"You can't have uniform grade and
Dack laws for waashington alone, be
said. "It is ridiculous to speak of
Duttine the Wenatchee district into the
same class with the islands of Puget
Sound or Yakima in the same class
with the Palouse. The horticultural
commissioner should be allowed to ea
tablish different standards for each
district. Federal regulation only will
rive nractical omformity."
On a standing vote the motion for
uniformity in state laws was declared
carried, 33 to 21. .
GEODETIC SURVEY
CREW REPORT IN
The completion or the observing on
an arc of primary trtangulation which
extenda 630 miles from northern Utah
northwestward to the Columbia river
in northeastern Oregon, thence west
ward down the Columbia to Portland,
ia announced from ita Washington,
D. C. office by tba United Stataa
coait.and geodetic aurvey.
About 100 stationa have had their
latitudes and longitudes accurately
determined and as they have been sub
stantially monumented with concrete
blocks, which have iascribed metal
tableta. they will be available for (fen
erations as starting points at federal,
state, boundary and other surveya and
engineering works.
The party, under C V. Hodgson,
making this survey, used for the first
time automobile trucks on primary
triangulation and they proved so suc
cessful, that all other aureying partiea
engaged on similar work will use this
meana of communication. The trueka
carried the party and outfit to the base
ot the peaks on which observations were
made with the theodolite. The camp
equipage and instruments were carried
from the truck to the top of the peaks
by horsea or by the members ot the
party.
Accurate elevations of numerous
mountain peaks were determined by
this survey. In fact, the" report
states, it ia only by such methods as
were employed that reliable elevation
of peaks can be obtained. It ia not
feasible to run linea of apirit levels up
the mountain sides and barometric lev
eling gives only crude results.
Most of the observationa were made
at night by use of acetylene lamps.
the longest distance observed being 134
miles.
Mr. Hodgson was' a schoolmate of
Prof. J. W. Crites and while in Hood
River last summer paid Prof. Crites a
visit.
The strong search lighta used by the
geodetic survery crew produced a bril
liant light that was watched with in
terest last summer by the guests of
Homer Rogers' Mount Hood Lodge.
ANTI-TUBERCULOSIS
AID IS SOUGHT
With its request for cooperation in
making the 1916 Red Cross seal sale
the most successful in state history and
ts announcement or. tuberculosis
Sunday," which will be observed either
December 3 or 10. the Oregon Associ
ation for the Prevention of Tubercu
losis brings a record of accomplishment
which jusistfies the original declaration
that "every seal sold ia a bullet in the
war against the Great White Plague."
Efficient organisation, low adminis
trative cost and personal service free
ly given by public spirited citizens
bave combined to -make every dollar
contributed toward the work of the
Association practically do the work of
two.
"Tuberculosis Sunday" furnishes a
reason for definitely carrying the now
state-wide debate for preventitive
effort against the disease and adequate
care of the stricken into every pulpit
and before every church audience of
Oregon. It will be made a time, too,
for gratitude and thankfulness because
of the great economic and humanitar-
an value of the results obtained.
The Oregon Association for the Pre
vention of Tuberculosia has commenced
survey of the state, county by
county. The surveys in Lane, Clatsop,
Jackson, Josephine and Washington
counties have been completed. Re
sults will be announced in detail when
the work is done.
The survey has already proven that
by its means information never before
gathered will be tabulated. The facil
ities or lack of facilities for the care,
treatment, and prevention of tuber
culosis in each county will be shown.
The number of cases will be listed and
segregated as to whether they are
incipient, moderately advanced or far
advanced, and also as to the number of
cases reported before the survey and
the number reported as a direct result
of it. The survey will provide for
each county a history of the disease in
that county, indicating its increase or
decrease, how many of the afflicted
contracted the trouble within the
county and the number that bad the
disease when they moved into the
county. Then it will be shown how
tuberculosis is distributed as to cities,
towns and rural communities. Cities
and towna having city hospitals, clinics
and dispensaries, school inspection,
and open air rooms will be designated.
The county a care of tuberculosis
patients in such institutions as jails
and poor farms will be discussed and
whether the county has a relief board
and what assistance ia granted in
tuberculosis cases.
The survey is definite and thorough
and its value to all health and public
officials will be bo great that the work
has the hearty approval and full co
operation of the Oregon State Board
of Health.
The proceeds of this years a sale of
Red Cross Seals will be used to carry
on the survey and to maintain tne
preventive work organised by the
Association.

THIS IS FIRE
LADDIES'DAY
FOOTBALL AM) DANCE CHIEF EVENTS
Thanksgiving Annually Devoted to Making
Merry With Volunteer Department
and Helping Raise Needed Funds
In Hood River one never thinks of
Thanksgiving without at the same
time giving mental recognition to the
Hood Kiver Volunteer fire denartment.
Thanksgiving day ia annually given
over to activities of the fire laddies.
On the afternoon of every Thanksgiv
ing day the football teams of the Hood
River Volunteer fire department and
the Hood River high school meet in
serious conflict at Columbia park.
Thanksgiving night Hood River people
en masse turn out and trip the light
fantastic with the firemen, their wives
and their sweethearts. Everybody goea
to tne hremen a ball, and everybody
haa a good time.and incidentally every
body helps raise funds much needed by
the fire boys in replenishing each year
the funds of their depleted treasury.
from last night, when the bonfire on
the Hartley block lighted the ancient
fir trees and the oaks, relics of original
forests saved from the axe of the city
builder, the annua) fireman's celebra
tion began. The aerpentine was gaily
danced by beardless youths of the high
school and the bewbiskered members of
the fire department. Chief Morgan, as
grimly sreious as Greene at the Battle
of Cowpens,made a few remarks urging
his boys to do their best. And today,
after you have eaten your turkey and
your cranberry "sass" and hie yourself
witn the wife and kiddies up to the
recreation center of the Heights, you
will find the Chief and his assistants
forming the vanguard of Volunteer fire
department rootera Whoever wins, this
afternoon a game ia going to be a good
one. it is the most interesting football
game of the season because of the fact
that it brings Hood River out on ene
common footing ;you may not be serry if
you do not go; for in ignorance ia blias.
but you will be mighty glad that you ve
gone, if you do take the trip and join
the rooters.
The lineup of the firemen's team ia
given as follows: Dutch Howard, cen
ter; Dutch Frans. left guard: Bill
Huggina, right guard. ; Bung Button.
right tackle: Lucky Lancaster, left
tackle ; Geg Franz, left end ; Rud Ira
holz, right end ; Deacon Coshow, quar
ter back; Hicka Button, right half;
Pug Ford, left half; jack Santon,
full back. Jumbo Shay. Bill Tolman.
Wilbur Haynes and brick Lafferty,
subs. Officials have been named as
follows: Earl Weber, of Mosier Uni
versity, referee; Crawford C. Lemmon,
university ot Viento, umpire; and T.
D. Waldie, Fowerdalo Institurte, head
lineman.
The game last season ended la a tie
7 to 7. From the merits of the twe
teams this year, according to their re
spective supporters, the result of this
season should be slightly closer.
At a meeting of the athletic commit
tees of the high school and fire depart
ment, it was decided to appropriate the
money 60 per cent to the high school
and 40 per cent for firemen. A new
pigskin will be used. The ball is now
on display in the show window of the
Frani Hardware Co. The winning team
will get the ball.
An appeal is made by the students of
the high school to have valley orchard-'
ists turn out for the ball game. The
students turned out and assisted in har
vesting the apple crop, and the beys
and girla are believers in reciprocity.
HOOD RIVER BANKS

Local bank clearances and deposits
are heavier at the present time and
show a more pronounced prosperity
than at any time for the past four
years. The total deposits of Hood
Kiver a three banking institutions show

than at the same time last year, ae
spite the fact that heavy demands
have been made in paying off the nu
merous transient laborers who have
participated in the harvest of the
bumper apple crop.
Maximum figures taken on dates Be
tween November I and the present
time, show an increase in deposits of
approximately $100,000 for the Butler
