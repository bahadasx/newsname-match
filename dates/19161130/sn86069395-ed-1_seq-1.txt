As Germans Approach With

Capital.
LACKOF REINFORCEMENTS
Officials Move to Jassy, Near
- Russian Frontier 37 Miles
from Capital.
Paris, Nov. 29. The Rumanian
government and diplomatic authori
ties have left Bucharest and gone to
Jassy, according to a Havas dispatch
from Bucharest.
Jassy lies about 200 miles north
east of Bucharest near the Russian
frontier.
The operations of the Teutonic
allies in Rumaina have brought them
appreciably nearer Bucharest and are
still progressing from the north and
west and to the south and southwest.
The operations in Macedonia are
somewhat beclouded by reason of di
vergent reports. Berlin says that
north of Monastir renewed attacks by
the entente allies failed while the
Serbian war oflice claims that in
fighting along the entire front, the
Serbs at several points made advan
ces of several hundred meters. Sofia
on the other hand, asserts that at
tacks on Hill 1050 and the village to
Jaralovo were put down by the Bul
garians and Germans, as likewise
was a British offensive in the Vardar
region south of the village of Bogoro
ditza. 'i. .
On the front in. France and in the
Austro-Italian theater nothing but
bombardments have takqn place.

UP 3 CENTS YESTERDAY
Marine Perils and Railroad
Embargoes Cause Owners
to Sacrifice Grain.
Chicago, Nov. 29. Railroad em
bargoes and marine perils that threat
ened to bring shipments of grain to a
standstill, led Tuesday to a semi-panic
in the wheat market. Exciting
breaks in value as much at times as
13gc a bushel, were followed by par
tial rallies. The close nevertheless,
was wild at $1.66 to $1.76i for De
cember at $1.74i to $1.75 for May
with the market as a whole 5 to 7Sc
under yesterday's finish. Other lead
ing staples too, all showed a set back,
corn 2 to 21 fa 2gc; oats 2J to 3 and
provisions 10 to 30 cents.
Local advices yesterday were that
the Chicago market had rallied and
that the price was 3 cents higher
than the day before.
HAVE YOUPAID
BETTER DO IT
This Is The Last Day To Es
cape The Penalty on Coun
ty and City Taxes.
All day yesterday and in fact for the
last several days the offices of both
the county sheriff and the city com
missioners have been busy places.
Lines of taxpayers have been at both
places waiting their turn to pay coun
ty and city taxes to escape the 6 per
cent, penalty that goes on after to
day. Miss Carrie Johnson, Miss Nora
Higgins and other office deputies
have been helping Sheriff Jewell W.
Smith and many thousands of dollars
have been paid this week. Every
body's state and county taxes are
higher this year, owing to the road
bond issue of $400,000, but few peo
ple who are able to pay will allow
the penalty to go on. At the city of
fice Commissioners W. R. Wicks, F.
H. Bassett, Clerk C. O. Prowse and
Mayor R. T. Siowe are all taking a
hand. All are officials of clerical
ability and arc handling the rush of
business with "neatness and dis
patch." They will keep open house
until midnight to-night to give every
body a chance.

FEARFUL
MB
Sustained By a Strange Wo
man Now at Jennie Stuart
Memorial Hospital.
MAY BE FATALLY BURNED
Naked And Suffering She
Walked Five Miles
Barefooted.
A strange woman who gave her
name as Katherine Denton and her
home as St. Louis arrived at the Hill
House Tuesday. Stic was neatly
dressed, wore glasses and was" about
35 years old, at 1 p. m., she gave the
proprietor $S to Keep for her and
said she would take a walk, and left
with a suit case. Some time later
she was at the forks of the Princeton
and Cadiz road, 2 miles out, and
asked Mr. Tinsley which was the
raid to Princeton. She continued on
foot five miles to a colored school
house near Brick church, She
entered this and finding a fire still
burning in the stove she took off her
shoes and glasses and, she says, lay
down to sleep. During the night she
awoke to find the house on fire and"
escaped with her clothing in flames
and every stitch of clothing she wore
was burned off. Her suitcase, shoes-
and glasses were lost in the fire-
Naked and suffering from perliaps
fatal burns she started back to town
and came 5 miles to the forks of the
road, where she found an old sack on
the porch of a vacant store and
wrapping it about her waited until day
light and then went into the house of
C. H. Tinsley nearby and got into a
bed while Mrs. Tinsley was getting:
breakfast. Discovered soon after
wards, aid was telephoned for and
Dr. F. M. Stites went to the scene
and rendered such surgical aid as he
could. Later the furniture truck of
the Waller & Trice Co., went out and
conveyed her to the Jennie Stuart
Hospital, where she is with slight
prospects of recovery.
She is fearfully burned about the
face, neck, shoulders and back and
the soles of her feet are lacerated
from walking on the new pike for
five miles. Her burns are bad
enough and the exposure she en
dured is liable to produce pneumonia,
or other complications.
The woman does not appear to be
demented but gives no account of
herself, except she says she lias no
friends and came here looking for
work.
