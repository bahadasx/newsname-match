of the country at tins time that

Officials would not discuss the quos- i

informally interpreted the warning as

proposal of the J. P. Morgan &

were actively pursuing the retreating
bandits. The telegraph operator at

in a .skirmish with a Carranza outpost
near Chihuahua, according to
Juarez officials, who added that the
military authorities there were undecided
at that time as to whether it
was only a roving band or an advance
point of Villa's columns.
At 11 a. m. (mountain time) the
high crowned hats of the bandits were
seen to the south, along the Mexican
Central main line, according to these
messages. The battle was opened a
few minutes later with a salvo from
cannon on Santa Rosa hill, the key to
the State Capital.
At 3 o'clock the battle was still
raging, the apparent advantages being
with the Government forces.
Villa was reported by General Gon
zaies to have had at least 3.500 men. |
practically all of whom were armed
and mounted. Ho was also believed
to have "had machine Runs, but no
heavy artillery. For this reason the
20 or more heavy held guns of General
Trevino's command were able to
rake the advancing lines of Villa bandits,

and dying men. one message stated.

the reasons for this refusal and simply
set December 1 as the date for the surrender
of the artillery required and
December 13 as the date for the surrender
of rides. The tone of the

Once With Copy to Obtain Approval
of General Carranza to Terms.?
Other Problems to Be Discussed.
Atlantic City, N. J.?A protocol providing;
for the conditional withdrawal
of the American troops now in Chihuahua.
Mexico, and for the military
control of the border, but with the
supplemental stipulation that United
States troops shall be sent into Mexico
in pursuit of bandits at any time
the American Government deems it
necessary was signed here by the
members of the Mexican-American
Joint Commission.
One copy was tuken by Alberto J.
I'ani, of the Mexican commission, who
left here for New York, whence he
will start Monday for Queretaro, to
submit it to General Carranza for approval.
The other copy will be delivered
to the American Government
by Secretary of the Interior Lane,
chairman of the American commission,
who left for Washington.
If the protocol is *-atifled by the
two Governments, tne commission
will convene again on December 8 to
resume the discussion of other questions
affacting the two countries, especially
those related to the protection
of life and proprty of Americans
and other foreigners in Mexico.
ii ratification by either Government
is withheld the work of the conference
will be declared at an end.
Following is a paraphrase of the
agreement:
First?The American troops
now in Chtttuahua commanded *1iy
Gen. John J. Pershing, shall be
withdrawn within 40 days from
the signing of the protocol by the
respective Governments provided
that within that time the conditions
in that part of Mexico have
not become such as to endanger
the American border. In such
event the time shall be extended.
Second?The Mexican army
shall patrol the Mexican side of
the border and the American army
the American side but this shall
not preclude co-operation between
the two forces to preserve
peace upon the border.
Third?It shall be left to the
commanding officers of the armies
on the border of both Nations
to enter into such arrangements
for co-operation in operations
against bandits whenever
it is possible.
Tbe rigl.i of the American Govern
raent to send troops across the border
in pursuit of bandits was not incorporated
in the protocol, but was
made the subject of a supplemental
memorandum. The Mexicans had
contended earnestly against signing
any agreement in which they appeared
to sanction what they termed the
violation of thoir National territory.
It was the agreement of the Americans
finally to content themselves
with stating the attitude of the United
States in a separate memorandum
that induced the Mexicans to sign
the agreement.

SEASON OF JOY
"When the frost is on the punkln
nd the fodder's in the shock."
ielpjr
At Least That Is the Opinion
Farmer Has of the Great
American Bird.
Housewives contemplating the
annual Thanksgiving dinner little
realize the months of preparation
which preceded the
i feast. Their cranberries are on the
market. Turkeys, dressed and ready
for the oven; huge yellow pumpkins,
with the earth still clinging " their
gaudy sides; orunges, apples, grapes
und nuts all await the cull of the epicure.
A trip to a market gives the laytuan
an Insight Into the real business of
Thanksgiving, and incidentally a quantity
??f rural folk lore which is illuminating.
Wandering around the wagons
which line the sidewalks of the
market space, a reporter the other day
came upon an old resident of Virginia
?a man with whiskers and a magniticent
quid of tohaceo and a small supply
of turkeys, the last named alive
and protesting vigorously against the
confinement of their crates.
After a little preliminary conversation
the old farmer dilated upon the
ways of the great American fete bird
and In his conversation knocked the
pedestal upon which the fowl is placed
squarely from under Its feet.
"Iiiggest fool bird in tin- world," he
; conllded to the reporter. "They ain't
! not hi n' in the world that I've ever
found that's us big an idjut as a turkey."
1 "In what way?" was asked.
"In every way," replied the farmer.
"I believe that the words 'not sense
enough to come in out of tho rain' was
written to describe a turkey. Did
you ever know, for instance, that a
turkey can drown itself during a raln'
storm?"
"What!" ejaculated the reporter.
"Fact," said the farmer. "Them
there birds hold no their heads dnrlmr
u rainstorm exactly as if they was
trying to swallow the whole creation.
Naturally, they can't drink the entire
output. And I tell 5*ou as a fact,
that I've found cases where they inauaged
to drown themselves."
Continuing on the peculiarities of
the bird, the old man said:
"They're helpless critters, too. Ain't
got as much gumption about them as
a chicken. And frail?let me tell you,
| young man, that a turkey is the great;
est natural-horn invalid in the world.
! They have to he watched every minute
or the lirst thing you know they'll up
and tile on you without a second's
| warning.
"I been raisin' turkeys for years
nnd years?had good luck with 'era,
! too. Hut I reckon I don't understand
more than half about them. Nobody
! does?particularly why the Creator,
when he made 'eta, didn't give 'em
i minds."
"Does that apply to wild turkeys as
; well as the tunic ones?" asked the re;
porter.
The old man spat thoughtfully and
profusely at a chip of wood in the
street, lie hit the mark.
"As to that," he said, "I can't exact:
ly say. "Mebbe there's something in
the ifI<-it that u tlirWev uh?n lio'vi iom,i
gets so used to ha via' folks -make a
fuss over him that he jest naturally
loses till his ambition. There's one

, was as big a fool as some that I'vu
raised there"wouldn't be a live wild
i turkey in the United Stutes within a

Cranberry Industry.
Study of the cranberry Industry by
government specialists lias shown it to
i be confined practically to three state.,:

cousin. Of the total crop, Massachusetts
produces in an average year

DAYDFREJQIGING
Thanksgiving Celebration Is a
Great Event on Cotton
Plantation.
ryMIANKSt'.lVlNG tlay on n cot
it < iii plantation moans an open
la-art and hand on the part of
the master and a full stomach, a
day of liuppiness, and, consequently,
gratitude on the part of the worker. It
moans, also, another, and, for that
little world, universal token, an offering
up of thanks for the numerous
little white pods which briug prolits
to the master and the winter's provisions
and clothes to the worker. Ilut
it a No means a day of play to all.
Hard as is the labor of the cotton
plantation hands, they do some extra
work willingly for Thanksgiving day
for several weeks beforehand. Tt is u
sure sign of the approach of Thanksgiving
day when one sights here and
| there through tin; woods the bobbing,
smoking pine torches that light the
way for a dozen black, shining, grinning
faces. It is the usual hunt for Mr.
Possum that keeps them from their
beds, and makes them scramble
through thickets, Jump ditches and
, wallow through marshes.
For several nights the woods for
miles around the plantation are the
scene of night activities. It is easy
enough to lind the trail of a 'possum,
and when once located llie dogs lead
a running, howling band in the hunt.
.Mr. Possum is, however, a slow mover,
and when he hears the yelps of those
hounds and the howls of the negroes
and sees the glare of the torches, ho
gets up the nearest tree and settles on
! a limb.
Somehow tho light fascinates him
I and lie usually settles on the lowest
limb. It Is Just what the hunters
want. Mr. Possum is noted for his
fondness for dead meat, consequently
a 'possum that is shot is not tiie most
savory of meats. Their object Is to
catch him alive and when the tree is
reached lie Is surrounded by a ring of
blazing torches and howling blacks until
in sheer fright he drops off, plays
dead and is bundled Into a sack, to bo
hustled off in the morning to the plantation
pen. Sometimes two or threo
are caught in a night and some of
them show tight. Once in the pen they
are fed for a couple of weeks with
food that takes away all trace of their
natural food and rounds out their
sides with good, sweet meat.
Several days before Thanksgiving
day some of the hands are taken from
the cotton fields and put to work
around the plantation buildings. This
is. with the exception of Christmas,
perhaps the most enjoyable task of
the year, for it means the preparation
for the feast which tho plantation is
to give its hands on the day when
thanks offerings are made.
Usually this is sprend in one of
the big buildings 011 the plnntutioii,
perhaps a barn or a cotton shed. Tho
hands are set to work at first to cleur
out the place and make it clean. Then
they [iut together a dozen or more long
Improvised tables and benches, and
lastly they decorate the building with
mi Kimis ui nags unu minting. ("i the
side near the center they also put up
