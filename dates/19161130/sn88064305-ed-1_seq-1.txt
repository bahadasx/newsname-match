n and 3 bales of cotton were placed

C- The above named cash premiums
Ig which I believe were well merited
" by the winners and fairly award
r. ed by the judges were given by
J. yourselves, the Hon. Washington
ie Parish School Board. In addi.
d tion to the cash premiums given
' by tbe School Board.to the win
- ners in this club work a total of
a- 37 premiums valued at $277.50
1 were given by interested and pro.
of gressive citizens of Franklinton
iY and Bogalusa.
)n Judging from the apparent in.
1- terest taken in the club work and
or school contests this year I feel
is sure that with the same liberal
>n inducements offered for next
Ze year that the number of contest
· ants and club exhibits for 1917
sr will double the number for 1916.
I am of the opinion that certain
)d changes in the rules and regula
d tions governing the sooool con
in tests and club %xhibits should and
will be made to add to the suc
cess of this work for 1917, and I
te an glad to report that certain
1e necessary changes and improve
s, mentson the Fair Grounds and
d Buildings are already being dis.
ir cussed.

t- tests and club work. I wish to ex.

Dear Era-Leader:
It Is again so soon that we
come to your pages bearing sad
inews. On the morning of No- j
* vember 15, 1916, at eight o'clock, ,
the death angi'l visited the home
of Mr. and MIs. Leonard Ci:r
kern, and bore in its flight their
infant daughter Quinnie.
Though this little darling took
e up her abode here only two short
months ago, she had so, sweetly
e and so completely entwin(led her
little life with those of her loved
ones that the parting at the river
was indeed sad Still we raise
our voices in one accord and
say, "Oh Lord, Thy Will Be
Done."
Besides fond parents and a
loving little sister, little Quinnie
is mourned by two grandmoth
o ers, one gran'dfatlier and the
relatives and friends of b th
parents, all of whom extend to
them their heartfelt sympathies.
But we do more. We offer our
loving Savior and Comforter, a
friend indeed. One who knows
I the sorrow and griefs of every
mortal, and who is willing to
d help bear their burdens.
For, "Yea though we walk
d through the valley of the shadow
of death, we will fear no evil: for
Thou art with us; Thy rod and
`t Tby staff they comfort us."
Death our dearest ties can sever,
n Bear our darling from our side,
Take her o'er, the dark cold river,
d On to Jordan's other side,
) There we'll meet our little baby
Y Over on the other shore,
Is There we'll sing Ilis praises
d forever,
And we'll part from her no
more.
It A Friend.

The Sanitary Ordinance.
Dear Editor: I notice in the
proceedings of the Police Jury
"A Sanitary Ordinance" provid
ing for the proper disposal of
carcasses of animals.' Most peo
ple do not fully appreciate the
importance of such an ordinance.
When population was sparse and
neighbors were far apart, it did
not matter much whether a dead
cow was carried to the woods or
r thrown in the stream, but under
3 the new conditions it is highly
i* important that a dead hog not be
thrown out for the vultures and
, dogs. These animals may be the
means of an epidemic of cholera,
or the dragging of one cow down
the road may spread charbou .
(anthrax). If every farmer in
y the parish would co-operate with
' the Police Jury in this matter
and help impress the importance
Sof proper disposal of dead car.
casses, the parish could be kept
1- almost free from these ooestly
:e diseases.
