So you're going to have turkey, stuffed tight as a drum,
(As tight as you'll be when it's eaten!)
And the drum-sticks themselves will be first to succumb,
So your turkey-drum "cannot be beaten."
Oh, well, have your turkey, browned fine In Its fat,
We're going to have something far better than that.
And potatoes? mashed smooth as the song of a flute,
And celery? crlßp as a fife Is,
And cranberry sauce? that most whlmxical fruit,
Tart, bitter and sweet, like a life is,
Epicurus himself might well take off his hat,
But we're going to have something far better than that.

"His Blade Is Half the"
Shears of Fate"
BY THE EDITOR
I have been re-reading "Cvrano de Bergera'c" As 1 sped along
from one of those familiar, magical pages to another it was impressed
on me how fine a model old Cyrano was for an editor to follow.
Cyrano, you know, was a 17th century soldier-poet. In those days
it was the custom for wealthy noblemen to become patrons of writers
who showed genius. With a protector once found, an author consid
ered his future assured, so far as money and position went.
But Cyrano refuses to be subsidized. When a count, attracted by
the skill of his swordsmanship and his poetical talent, offers to pro
duce his play and otherwise assist him, Cyrano declines, at first po
litely, and when pressed, with cutting sarcasm.
The count, stung by a taunt that Cyrano flings at the aristocracy
of the day, retorts, "When one attacks* them it often happens that a
windmill with its long arms hurls you into the mud."
"Or," corrects Cyrano, "rather among the stars."
When his well-meaning friends remonstrate with him for thus re
jecting high fortune and position, Cyrano replies:
"What should I need to do? Seek a mighty protector, take a
patron, and, l;kc an obscure ivy twining around the trunk of a tree,
procure myself a guardian by licking the bark, climb by trickery in
stead of rising by force? No thank you.
"Be like the rest and dedicate my verses to men of wealth?
Change to a buff on in the vile hope of seeing a favorable smile rise to
some minister's lips? No thank yon.
"Breakfast every day on toads? Hav_ my belly worn out with
crawling? A skin quickly soiled about the knees? Execute tricks of
dorsal agility? No thank you.
"To calculate, to be afraid, to grow pale, to prefer to make a call
rather than write a poem, to frame petitions, to be introduced? No
thank you; no thank you! no thank you!"
Then, in a remarkable outburst Cyrano outlines the free life he
lives. He has, he says, "No protector/ but (his hand on his sword) a
protectress."
And a wonderful sword it is, as the play makes clear in a half
dozen scenes. In one duel Cyrano composes a ballad to the rythm of
his lunging, announces in the second verse that on the last line of the
envoi he will thrust his opponent in the belly—and does it.
As one admirer declaims, "His blade is half the shears of fate!"
And so, to the end, lives Cyrano—freo-minded, outspoken, taking
always the part of the deserving.
His triple plume, "free from creases, free from stain," he holds
high to the last.
May his refreshing career reflect itself in this newspaper, is the
wish that lies strongest on me as I finish the book again.

NOBODY RUNNING!
BY MABEL ABBOTT
Up to date, this is the funniest school board election on record!
There is no lack of candidates—eleven of them for the three vacancies; but
they cannot be said to be running. They are standing still.
Day after tomorrow is election day; but that is the farthest thing from the
minds of most of the candidates, apparently.
A few of then) arc well known, and \ utcrs have perhaps already sufficient
Information on which to dam action .-it the polls Saturday; others are unknown

HAVEN'T THOUGHT OF IT
Earnest Inquiries by a reporter, however, for informal ion .is to policies, plans,
ideas, etc., met with the frank statement from several that they "hadn't given
the matter any thought." i
Others suggested that they might be able'to formulate some kind of a state
ment if given a little more time.
Jn two or three cases, notably those of Ralph Stacy and .Mrs. Ida McQuea
ten, prompt, concise statements were given without delay.
Two or three of the candidates' names do not appear in the telephone di
rectory, and in one or two instances, repeated attempts at different hours of the
day mid evening to reach a candidate by telephone were unsuccessful.
