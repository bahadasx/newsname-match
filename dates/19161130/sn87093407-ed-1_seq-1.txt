MARY LYLES WILL EAT TURKEY TODAY
GENE LEVY, GERALD
AND OTHERS HELP HER
TO PASS THANKFUL DAY
Mrs. Mary Lyles, wrinkled, aged, bent with her three score
years and fourteen, has wonderfully bright blue eyes.
We did not notice that yesterday.
t But today—Thanksgiving day—we of The Star are thankful
that she came to us, instead of elsewhere, to seek a way out of her
difficulties. The light that shone today in those blue eyes which
but yesterday seemed so faded and worn and weary, brings a
recompense all its own.
For Mrs. Mary Lyles is happier today than she has been for a
long, long time.
Yesterday she could only feel the weight of that formal docu
ment which told her to vacate her little shack for failure to pay
rent.
Today, this weight is lifted from her mind and her blue eyes
reflect the smile on her lips and the gratitude of her heart to
the kindhearted folk of Seattle who responded so promptly and
made it possible for her to enjoy Thanksgiving day as few people
can.
Not only hu the rent for this month been provided, but alto
for <next month, and a few dollars extra besides.
Mrs. Mary Lyles will eat turkey today, too.

LITTLE GIRL REGAINING HEALTH THRU HELP OF ALASKAN
VILLAGERS IS REASON ENOUGH TO MAKE 'EM THANKFUL
More than 200 odd residents in the Alaska village
of L'nga have a great reason to be thankful today and
they don't know it.
Ihe reason is 0-year-old Mabel Beeson. She is an
inmate of the Children's Orthopedic hospital, 2107
Warren st.
Mabel used to he the town pet of l'nga, a village on
the desolate Bering coast. From birth something had
been the matter with her hip.
She couldn't run and laugh and play like the other
hardy youngsters of her village.
Ifer fortitude in the fa< e of seeming incurable afflic
tion won the admiration and sympathy of everyone who
knew her. And everyone in Unga knew her. Her wan
smiles and her unfailing courage were the talk of the
lown.
But she seemed 'loomed to a life of gain, and tliere
was grave uncertainty about how long that life would he.
The first ray of hope that she and her parents and
her fellow villagers ever -aw for her was < ast by the
"I have my family,"" and the

visited her, quickly won her confidence and that of her
parents. He examined her under-developed hip.
To him her case was not hopeless.
(hiarded predictions of her ultimate recovery under
proper treatment down in Seattle, spread rapidly thru the
village. When questioned, he intimated that the treat
ment might cost a lot of money a stun, at least, that
seemed large to Mabel's parents.
And In- hinted, in just the right way, that it ought
to be fun for the villagers to contribute to a jackpot that
would see Mabel thru.
A hint was more than was needed, too, as subse
quent events proved.

I he fishermen lost no time in raising that amount.

And so, on October 1. after the whole village had
bid her good bye, Mabel was put aboard a Nome boat,
bound for Seattle. Ihe stewardess was duly impressed
with the importance of her charge. Mabel was landed
safely in the < )rthopedic hospital.
So rapid has been her recovery, and so stire is she
of being able to leave next spring completely cured
that today is her happiest Thanksgiving.
I ho<e in charge of child invalids and cripples at
the hospital say that no other child has so much to be
