Save The Birds to "
Fight the Boll Weevil J
|j?' It is generally admitted that the
best friends the farmers have are a:
if'y the insect-eating and weed-seed eat- tj
S ing birds. Many farmers have real- n
ized this for some time, -but now that L!
actual invasion by the boll weevil is ci
about to take place the truth is pi
pk brought home to every man that he w
S^gXm must protect these friends of his for
r ? he will soon be in sore need of their I pi
^ It is estimated by competent au- b<
thorities that if quail, doves, meadow ar
larks and plover could be fully pro- ui
tected for a few years the ravages of as
the boll weevil would be greatly re- ac
duced.
Realizing the seriousness of this
situation, the following petition is being
circulated over the county and
signed by many land owners who wish
to do ull they can to reduce the damages
that will be done by the entrance
of tho boll weevil. The names appearing
in this article have already
been signed in Chesterfield. Petitions
in other parts of the county are to
be heard from and their names will
be printed next week. Anyone wishing
to enroll as a friend of the birds

[- Sentiment Strongly 1
Improvements; W
^ A well nttended meeting of the a
, Commercial Club of Chesterfield was ^
o held last Monday night in the club
11 room.
The committee appointed to draft
4J a petition calling for an election on
U the subject of a bond issue to build
jf waterworks and sewerage reported
e exccTte'nt progress.
'? I It is believed that public sentiment
^ overwhelmingly in favor of the
project and plans were discussed for
carrying the enterprise through.
In a very short time the names of"
73 property owners and voters were
signed to the petition and it is believed
that many more will sign when
given an opportunity to do so. The
names already signed are published in
The Advertiser this week. Others
will be published in the next issue.
An interesting report was given by
Prof. Henderson, who, with Mr. T. E.
Mulloy, made a survey of the town
last week.
Prof. Henderson, now leader of
rf Chesterfield's young band, has had
considerable experience as a hydraula
ic engineer. Mr. Mulloy is an experienced
surveyor. As a result of
|f their survey and Prof. Henderson's
calculations, he reports that the town
a of Chesterfield is a comparatively
simple proposition from an enginecr[.
ing point of view.
_ He estimates that with material
at anything like normal prices, a first[.
class system of waterworks and sewn
erage can be put in here for approxg
imately $27,000.
i_ It is believed that the water rents
i, will pay the running expenses of the
c system and in time retire the bonds.
It is also agreed that the reduced insurance
rates will be considerable.
The club is enthusiastic over the
prospects for this improvement.
Following is the petition and the
names already affixed. Those wish,
ing to sign, who have not done so,
? will see either Mr. J. A. Welsh or Dr.
s I). II. Laney.

National Thanksgiving jD
By Edward Everett Hale. 1
The people of the United States old
celebrate Thanksgiving Day with die
more and more accord every year, mu
Indeed, one might say they have more 1
and more reason. Pit
The fathers of New England, hem- at
med in between a wilderness and the hirj
sea, watched their doubtful crops in ^
. vie
anxious memories of other years of j
famine. When they found that once js <
more there was fish enough and pork Chi
enough and corn and beans and pump- 'J
kins and squashes and turnips enough '"^c
to carry them through the winter they
met to thank God, knowing full well ^
how many haznrds they had passed ?'''
through, for those days as compared
with to-day were days of pinching 1,1 1
poverty. The New England historian,
Dr. Palfrey, says, with a certain dry- a'w
ness, which shows probably some per- s^?
sonal preferences, "Baked beans point ^a
to the time when it was desirable to anc'
make the most of the commonest ?^',t
vegetable by flavoring it with the *
flesh of the commonest animal." 'la"
All this is happily changed. For the
...:_J i i - ? - " ?
ouiiu, uiuccu, iiic oHi pern 01 iamine
is well nigh forgotten. And why? ')eo
The American of to-day gives thanks owr
that famine is well nigh impossible. *? 1
First of all, he remembers that he ('ur
is no longer dependent upon the crops *'ial
of a few hundred square miles or the ^0'c
fishing voyage of a single summer. Is n
Thanks to the providence of God as
it has worked in history and to the
work of brave men who believed they IV
were children of God, the petty colo- Hoj
nies which were thus described are C.,
now one nation. Of that nation the 102
meanest citizen, the most foolish, the Sea
weakest and the poorest, has every half
right and privilege before the law vivc
which belongs to the strongest, the a si
richest and the wisest, though he were ton
born in the purple of luxury. To the Ji
widow's son of the poorest citizen of Wil
that nation, then, there will come his Mrs
daily bread in answer to his daily " 'I
prayer, though it come from the mill- for
ing of California wheat or be the sal- as 1
mon caught at the falls of the Spo- cea
kane, without let or hindrance from pou
any power on earth. If there is food rl
in plenty in one region, as by the fall Ric
of an avalanche down a mountain, it sen
will certainly seek consumption in an- We
other region. And this the American call
boy and girl owe to the good Providence
and to the brave men who made
this country one and have kept it one.
It is too much the blindness of our I
time to speak as if such a simple business
as daily food came to us as a L<
matter of course. There is, indeed, a
careless habit in which Americans often
speaky. as if, because they are ^ot
Americans, they have everything ^Vl
without so much as asking for it. *U1
Fourth of July orators and street cor- ?al
ner braggarts alike talk of the natural ^tl
products of this country almost in the
tone of the emigrants who expect to '
pick up a doubloon upon the sidewalk.
One is tempted to ask such braggarts Go.
why the country did not produce such ?il
wealth 100 years ago or 200 years (
wv... a,.a Ch
ert? Why were the hills of Alabama
only a hiding place for a few thou- '
sand Creek Indians? Why did they
| not forge the iron under their feet?
Why did not the Irocjtiois in western
New York pick from their trees the
peaches and the pears such as have
been growing there this autumn? ji( t
The answer is this: All the wealth . ,
(lit
of America conies to her from the
work of her men and women. The
victory which yields it is their victory.
It is the victory of spirit conquering {.((]
matter. It comes in the daily miracle
of daily life, where children of God,
led by God, taught by God, alive in j
his life and fellow workmen with him, j
carry out his designs and subdue the j *
earth. It is neither sensible nor grate- | u
ful to speak of teeming granaries, of B
increasing trade, of new mines, of oil, j
of iron or of gas as if these things
were wealth in themselves. They arc
only wealth when man strikes the
rock and its waters flow. And this j
man must be not the savage man who j
cares only for his own personal appetite.
It must be man, the child of :
