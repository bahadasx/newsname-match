An article written by II. J Grara
llch of the Nebraska Experiment Sta
tion on the subject. "What Kind of
Feeder CattteT" waa published in
The Nebraska Farmer of November
2t. The article 1a Interesting thru
oit. but the part showing the trend
of the demand for feeders and (he
kind that will probably be wantedr
most in the next few years will be of
special interest to ranchmen who
supply the feeder market.
Decause of the importance of the
subject, to ranchmen as well as
farmers and feeders, and the able
manner In which it is handled by
Prof. Gramllch, it is reprinted en
tire, as follows:
Iiu) Ing Stock Cattle
Each year the farmer who has a
considerable amount of grain and
roughness to feed is confronted with
the problem of buying stock cattle
unless he is equipped, as few farm
ers are, to maintain a breeding herd
and produce his own calves. Upon
the large markets in almost any
month of the year he can find cattle
of all classes, ages and grades. These
,cattle are for sale. Generally they
are in the hands oT a speculator,
who is only too glad to move them,
providing he can socuro a price
which will insure him a profit. Con
sequently the question of what kind
of cattle to buy is not so much one
of what classes are available as
which one of the many classes avail
able will prove most profitable.
In the fall months, when most
farmers buy their feeders, steers are
avauaDie ranging irom calves up to
three years old and over. These
calves as a rule are fresh from the
range and, carry a considerable
amount of milk fat. They can' be
taken out and fed a rather heavy
grain ration during the winter and
spring and erturned to the market
il :
In the early summer as finished baby
beeves. Good, uniform calves of one
of the beef breeds generally bell in
carload lota at a figure around IS a
hundredweight, or fully $1 higher
than older steers of the name breed
ing. Such calves will make gains of
about two pounds a day under feed
lot conditions. Under exceptional
conditions they may make three
pounds a day. This, however, re
quires the use of large quantities of
high-price feeds, and It is doubtful
if the added gain thus secured is en
tirely Justifiable. A calf when on
maximum feed will consume as much
as fifteen pounds, of corn, three to
four pounds of oil meal and three to
five pounds of alfalfa hay a day.
Calves eat proportionately less than
older steers and make 100 pounds of
gain with less feed. In fact, it Is
safe to say that the oldof steers be
come the less economical , are their
gains.
Making Baby Reef '
It must be remembered that the
feeding of baby boeves involves
quite largely the use of highly con
centrated feeds. This means that
calves will ont use up very much
roughness, providing they are fed In
to really highly finished baby beeVcs.
The one way to produce baby beeves
and at the same time satisfactorily
use up home-grown roughness Is to
keep a herd of breeding cows and
produce calves from them, allowing
the cows to winter on roughness.
Calves always should be vaccinat
ed against blackleg. Sometimes a
purchaser Is able to ascertain wheth
er calves already havo been vaccin
ated. It is not advisable to dehorn
calves where they are taken out to
be finished as baby beeves. The de
horning sets them back materially,
and besides the horns do not bother
in the feedlot. Packers do not dis
criminate against horns when the
calves are sold.
A good grade of calves, such as
would develop into good baby beeves
should weigh approximately 400
pounds apiece when they reach the
market. In selecting calves to feed
out as baby beeves, It is very import
ant to see that they are low-set, com
pactly built and of an early-maturing
type; otherwise there is a mark
ed tendency for the calves to grow
during the first winter and spring,
and when they go back to market
they will be discriminated against
because of a lack of finish. Baby
beeves marketed In June, at which
time they are about fourteen months
old. usually weigh from 800 to 900
pounds apiece. At that season of
the year they are comparatively safe
from discrimination, becauso with
the approach of warm weather there
Is a strong demand for light cuts of
beef.
In recent years many feeders have
taken to the feeding of calves and
the game is not looked upon as so
fascinating as it was five or six years
ago. Perhaps It Is as safe- as any,
however, owing to the fact that the
cost of making the gains is some
what less than with older cattle, and
the- Initial weight Is so small com
pared to the final weight that the
purchase price quite easily can be
absorbed.
Yearlings are flood Feeders
An increasing number of cattle
feeders have adopted the policy of
feeding yearlings. In tho fall months
It is possible to purchnso yearlings
weighing from 600 to 800 pounds of
almost any quality desired. It the
feeder wishes to put these cattle on
the market an beeves tho following
spring, it is quite essential that they
be comparatively even, of good width
and reasonably well bred, else they
will develop bo unevenly and will
lack the attractiveness so much
sought by the buyers of handy
weight steers. When calves are sell
ing at $8 a hundredweight, a good
class of yearling steers usually can
be purchased at tfbout $7.
Such steers will do quite well on
roughness during the fall and can be
put on feed about the first of 'the
new year and finished for a rather
late spring market. Steers taken
out at a weight of about 700 pounds
and handled In this, way can bo made
ready for a June market weighing
from 1,100 to 1,200 pounds. It has
been a noticeable fact that during
recent yearB steers of such weight,
providing they carried sufficient fin
ish, have brought practically the top
of the market 'at almost any season
of the year, more particularly from
May until fall. Such steers make
their gains at a somewhat lower cost
than do two year olds, and will con
sume considerably more roughness
and other comparatively cheap feeds
than will calves.
If a farmer la purchasing cattle to
rough through the winter and run on
grass tho following summer, steers
of the above class usually will be
found the most satisfactory. This
season, however, the man who pur
chased .light two year olds last fall,
roughed them through the winter
and pastured them In the summer
sold them as grass-fat three year olds
to a much better advantage than did
men who had the lighter grass-fat
two year olds.
Two Year Olds In Favor
A great majority of feeders pre
fer to handle two-year-old steers.
These steers may be found In an as
sortment of weights varying from
800 pounds up to 1,060 pounds. Us
ually this difference In weight Is due
very largely to the amount of flesh
the steers carry. . Two year olds
have an advantage over yearlings
and ralves In that they are more ma
ture and are able better to withstand
adverse weather conditions; hence
they need less shelter. They will al
so consume a larger proportion of
roughness to grain In the feedlot.
The grade of steers that bring $8
on the market as calves and $7 as
yearlings usually can be purchased
ataround 16 to $6.40 as two year
olds. This gives the feeder some
what more margin on which to op
erate, although proportionately less
of the finished weight will represent
gains roado in the feedlot; conse
quently he must look for his profit
more In the margin between the cost
price and the selling price than In
the gains he makes on the animals.
Two-year-old steers pot in In the
fall weighing In the neighborhood of
900 pounds, carried several months
on rough feed and then finished on
grain usually go back to market
some time between February and
June weighing from 1,200 to 1,400
pounds, and In most yearB find a
ready sale. There are times, bow
ever, when buyers discriminate
against such steers because of ex
cess weight.
Few Three Year Olds Fed
At the present time three-year-old
steers aro fed only In small numbers.
It is doubtful whether a feeder Is
Justified in taking out three-year-old
steers, because generally such steers
carry sufficient flesh to cause pack
ers to bid on them in the fall, and
then when fed they are likely to
coue back to the market weighing
more than the trade demands. Pack
ers' are very adverse to heavy cattle
at certain seasons of tho year. Fur
thermore, anlnmls of the ago and
weight of throo year olda usually
make gains at a high cost. It re
quires a larne amount of feed to
maintain their body weight. Usual
ly three year olds as feeders sell at
prices somewhat higher than two
year olda, becaune of competition
from the killers. Thin three year
olds, of course, are an exception to
this.
In summing up the above we may
say that the age of cattle to select
depends very largely upon the con
dtt'ons under which they are to be
fed. If a feeder Is desirous of mak
ing a short feed and turning his cat
tle back in a short time, say In sixty,
ninety or 100 days, he certainly
should take out throe yen' olds or
fleshy two year olds. If ho expects
to rough the cattle along in the
stalk-fields and on hay until about
the first of the year and then finish
them for an April market, two-year-old
steers would probably answer his
requirements best. If he has In
mind a longer feeding period and
has good shelter, yearlings or calves
would prove highly satisfactory.
Calves Itequlre Irftng Feeding
One thing to remember, however,
Is that calves should not be taken
out with the expectation of finishing
them as baby boeves short of eight
months, and some feeders have come
to the conclusion that ton months Is
even better. Yearlings can be fin
ished In somewhat less time than
calves, although the feeder should
figure on taking out yearlings that
he would need to hold from seven to
eight months In order to make the
proper finish.
The kinds of feeds a feeder has
available must also be taken Into
consideration in deciding what age
of feeder cattle to buy. Where It
Is a question of disposing of a con
siderable amount of grain and only a
limited quantity of hay, the younger
cattle doubtless would answer the
purpose best. If, as usually Is the
case, the object in buying steers is
to use up available feed in the stalk
fields as well as considerable hay of
poor quality, then the best plan
would be to buy older steers, rough
them several months and finish them
on a grain and hay ration.
At the Missouri river markets, cat
tle generally aro divided into three
classes: Westerns, southerns and na
tives. Westerns originate In tho
range country and have been raised
under range conditions. They gen
erally are dehorned and are more or
less branded. While of good breed
ing and well built, they are likely to
be wild and are entirely unaccustom
ed to man on foot.
CIhshos of Feeders
Southerns are of more or less In
ferior breeding, usually small for
their ago, narrow bodied, off color
and rather plain In quality. They
generally come from Texas and oth
er southwest states. Often they are
transplanted to northern ranges as
two year olds. It Is not uncommon
to see tralnolads of theso cuttle mov
ing north in June and July, and even
later.
