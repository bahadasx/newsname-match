PLEA OF ASBIE SEBASTIAN
FOR KILLING ZACK SIMPSON LAST

GOOD MUSIC AT
OPERA HOUSE.
Mr. W. J. Homans, manager of the
Opera House has engaged for his pa
trons and music-lovers of Lancaster,
the bci vices of Mr. Alvin Thompson,
of Hot Springs. Ark., as violinist and
Mr. A, I), Kirk, of this city, as pian
ist. These excellent musicians are
presenting, each night n program of
both classical and popular music which
together with the high class pictures
that are being shown, is being enjoyed
by large audiences. Mr. Romans pre
sents Ilillie llurke in "Gloria's Ro
mance" Friday night.
The jury in the ca nf the Common
wealth against Asbie Sebastian for kill
ing Zack Simpson last June was finally
secured after the regular panel had
been exhausted, with only five of its
members accepted, alrout seventy-five
having been summoned from the lower
end of the county yesterday afternoon.
Including the character witnesses, there
will be about fifty in all, and the case
will probable not be finished until Fri
day, as court will adjourn over one day
on uccount of Thanksgiving. Indica
tions are that tne case will be a hard
fought one, os able council has been
employed on each side and every inch
of the ground is being fought bv the
attorneys represented. Judge L. L.
Walker and J. K. Uobinson are defend
ing Sebastian nnd the Commonwealth
is being looked after by Emmet I'ur
year, G. C. Walker and J, I. Hamilton
In a few minutes talk Mr. I'uryear
stated the case foi the commonwealth
and said from the fnct that the defend
ant Sebastian, having failed to testify
on the examining trial, his statement
would naturally be short. Common
wealth claims that Sebastian was drunk
and that he enterHined malice .against
Simpson for the killing of a. mule and
any claim thnt t!ie defendant would
make that his life was in danger, would
be false.
Mr Uobinson consumed nearly an
hour in stating the Jcase for the de
fendant and several times his remarks
were objected to by Mr I'uryear, until
they seemed to irritate the speaker,
which cnued tne court to threaten a
fine if the remarks did not cease. Mr
Uobinson stated that it would be clear
ly shown by the evidence that Mr Se
bastian was plainly acting in nelf de
fense when he shot Simpson and that
the reason and only reason that Sebas
tian did not testify on the examining
trial, was because he was physically un
able to do so on account of the wounds
intlicted by the sons' of Simpson at the
time of the shooting, and who will be
the main witnesses for the common
wealth in the case. He stated that it
would he proven that the sons were in
the conflict and were approaching Se-
basiia-i in a threatening manner and
that Simpson had called to the boys.

fire the shot that was fatal to Simpson
and almost at the same time he was
struck In the head bv one of the (boyr,
while the other grabbed the gun from
the defendant and beat him into insen
sibility, by breaking it over Sebastian's
head. A map of the grounds where
the difficulty took place was shown the
jury by Mr Robinson, that they may
be better acquainted with the local
surroundings in the tobacco patch
where it seems that all the conversa
tions of the day hnd (aken place that
led up to the shooting. Sebastain will
claim that he was carrying the gun to
kill u young rabbit for Mrs. Wilson
who was the wife of his tenant and
had been quite tick for several days,
and that when he came up to Simpson
in the tobacco patch after a few casual
remarks Simpson said, "Asbie, your
son Clifton sayB, that Letcher (Simp
son a son) killed your dog," to which
Sebastian replied, "I don't know any
thing about that, but you have been
accused of killing my mule," at which
time Sebastian claims that Simpson
called to the boys to come on.
On account of the prominence of both
families and the large connection thru-
out the county the court house is filled
with interested spectators and every
ear is alert to catch the testimony of
euch witness. As we go to press one
of the ous of Simpson is on the stand.
8,000 TURKEYS
Handled By Local Dealers Here. Mostly
Shipped To Boston Market.
The local dealers, Ilailey and Moes
and II. II. Kortlicott. have handled for
the Thanksgiving market approximate
ly 8,000 turkeys averaging each 12
pound, at an average cost of 21 cents
a pound cr a total of UG.000 pounds,
bringing the tnial sum in dollars up to
near about $20,000. Quite a number of
these turkeys were shipped in from
Virginia, but practically all were
slaughtered here by these local dealers.
Several hundred pickers have been
employed for the past two weeks and
they are given five cents for each tur
key picked. Some of them have be
come so proficient and rapid as to make
as high as $4. day. The negro women
are by far the most experts In this line
and this Industry has been quite n boon
to them during the turkey picking
season.
