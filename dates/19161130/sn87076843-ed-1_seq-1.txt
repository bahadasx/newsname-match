That the high cost of living may
be reduced by the increased use of
milk, a highly nutritious and
digestible food, is the opinion of
A. E. Perkins, dairy chemist at the
Ohio Experiment Station. He says
that a quart of milk is equal in
food value to three-fourths of a
pound of beefstead, eight eggs, 15
pounds of oysters, two pounds of
hsh, six pounds .of tomatoes or
three pounds of apples, and the
milk is more easily digested and
far more economical than any of
the other foods.
Ono erroneous conception the
public has, this chemist declares,
is that cream contains in concen
trated form most of the valuable
food material present in the milk
from which the cream was taken.
Because of this fact the cream is
usually sold for as much as tho
original milk, Avhile the skimmilk,
which contains about half of the
food material, is fed to animals or
thrown away. lie has shown that
in 4ortf nvnnm ?c o Invnvtr nti1 lnf t

Protein is the most expensive in
gredient in foods, being especially
costly in meats. It is exception-!
ally abundant in milk. For this -
reason milk is said to be a suitable
food to balance a diet rich in
starches, sugars and fat, such as
would result from the use of onlv
cereals, fruits and vegetables
j
ordinary prices Chemist Perkins
has figured that skimmilk at 10
cents a quart would be a more
economical food than meat.

STOP THE FIRST COLD.
A cold does not get well of itself.
The process of wearing out a cold
wears you out, and your cough be
comes serious if neglected. Hacking
coughs drain the energy and sap the
vitality. For 47 years the happy com
bination of soothing antiseptic balsams
in Dr. King's New, Discovery has
healed coughs and relieved congestion.
Young and old can testify to the effect
iveness of Dr. King's New Discovery
for coughs and colds. Buy a bottle to

Grave Defect In Military System.
During our Mexican war under Gen.
Winucld Scott 104,000 troops were em
ployed, and only 12,000 of this nuiubei
were of the nillltlu. Scott wns nuic
hamllcappud, however, by the custom
of short enlistments, and the total ab
sence of system pertaining thereto.
The commander learned on reaching
Pueblp that seven of his eleven regi
ments had decided to terminate their
services at the end of tho year, a
problem that wns only solved by the
lack of vitality of the Mexican forces.
)
Now Lookout.
When a cold hangs on as often hap
pens, or when you have hardly gotten
over one cold before you contract an
other, look out for you aro liable to
contract some very serious disease.
This succession of colds weakens the
system and lowers tho vitality so that
you are much more liable to contract
chronic catarrh, pneumonia or con
sumption, Curo your cold while you
can. Chamberlain's Cough Remedy
has a great reputation. It is relied
upon by thousands of people and never
disappoints them, Try it. It only

'One of the most important
events in the estimation of the
average small boy in Perrysburg
during the years from 1865 to 1875
was tho arrival in town of a cir
cus, of which wo usually had two
or three each season. The bill post
ers would plaster the sides of Law
ranee and Cook big livery barns
and the barn near the old Shepler
House, on the corner of Louisiana
and Indiana avenues, with large
posters depicting the wonderful
and thrilling feats to be performed
in the circus, and the colossal ar
ray of wild and ferocious animals
to be seen in the menagerie. And
how the boys would feast their
eyes on those wonderful pictures,
and discuss the several circuses
they had seen in the past, each boy
of course having his particular fav-
orito circus. Alsi, how gladly and
sters then.
In tho sixties, before the circuses
were ot the, mammoth proportions
h aro f the present day, they
traveled from town to town m
SS- haiv v.mter I1
wero mostly located insomo of the
eastern states, at tho beginning of
each season they usually traveled
from east to west, and it was geif-
eiau,v uuuut me muicne oi iuay
when the first one would bo due in
our town, they invariably coming
in over the old Fremont pike.
Usually it is with some difficulty
thpt a boy is separated from his
bed, but on the morning of this
day of days for the boys the moth-
ers of the young hopefuls would
streaKs or ciawn, groups ot tliem
would start out the old pike to
meet the circus.
Some of the earlier ones would
go out as far as the old lime kilns
of James McMonagle, where Lime
City now. is, others as far and be
yond the old toll gate. And how
happy these youngsters would be
if only they could walk near the
elephants, or within reaching dis
tance of the Shetland ponies. Ar
riving at the circus grounds, they
willingly and anxiously did all
kinds of errands if by "so doing
they thought they would be" able to
see the show for nothing. And tho
circus men often took advantage
of the little fellows. Many a little
chap spent several hours with two
heavy buckets, carrying water for
the elephant, from the wells of
nearby residences, with tho prom
ise of the showmen to admit them
to the show free, only to have their
ambitions end in disappointment.
And as for school on circus day
well, the building was there, and
so were tho teacher and a few girl
pupils, but most of the boys were
to bo found over on the circus
grounds.
The first circus the writer was
privileged to attend gave its per-
lormance on tho lot on tho south
west corner of Indiana avenue and
Walnut street, opposite the old
court house. For many years all
the circuses gave their perform
ances on tho plot of ground gen
orally known0 as the "show
grounds," in the square bounded
by Fifth and Sixth, and Elm and
Locust streets.
Some of the first circuses ro
niembered by mo which exhibited
in tho Burg were those owned re
spectively by Dr. Thayer, "Yan
kee" Kobmson, van Amberg, John
Robinson, Dan Rico, Adam Fore
paugh, G. G. Grady, and AV. "W.
Cole. These wero all one-tent
shows, and tho circus performance
and menagerie wero all under one
canvas. Tho first show with two
tents one each for the circus and'
menagerie to tho best of my rec
ollection, was Adam Forepaugh's,
along about 1870, while J. E. Coop
er & Co. brought on the first three
tent show. This at that timo was
considered tho biggest circus,

How Catarrh is Contracted.
Mothers are sometimes so thought
less as to neglect the colds which their
children contract. The inflammation
of the mucus membrane, at first acute,
becomes chronic and the( child has
chronic catarrh, a disease that is sel
dom cured and that may prove a life's
burden. Many persons who have this
loathsome disease will remember hav
ing had frequent colds at the time it
was contracted. A little forethought,
a bottle of Chamberlain's Cough Rem
edy judiciously used, and all this trou
ble might have been avoided. Obtain
