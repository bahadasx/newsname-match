LITTLE HOPE OF

Diplomatic Opinion is That

War Shortening.
(By Cyril Brown.)
Vienna, Nov. 30.—In view of the
splendid military situation the Aus
trian people are making no pretense
of disguising their normal human
yearnings for peace which today are
talcing the form of a lively piatonic
Interest in early peace prospects.
From the sentimental regret arising
spontaneously in Austrlans' minds
that the venerable and sorely-tried
Francis Joseph could not have lived
to end his days in peace, it has been
only a short and logical step to spec
ulation as to what effect, if any, the
change of kaisers may have in ac
celerating the coming of the peace
dove, and the general opinion tends
to be that it will be favorable rather
than otherwise.

Bismarck, Nov. SO.—While Luther
E. Birdzell of the law faculty of the
University of North Dakota, agrees
with his prospective associates on
the supreme bench that the three
justices-elect have a right to get onto
the Job next Monday, he will not be
in Bismarck then to join them in
their efforts to oust Chief Justice Flsk
and Associate Justices Burke and
Goss.
Justice-elect Birdzell, who spent a
day this week at the supreme court,
said there is no question in his mind
as to the justice and propriety of the
stand taken by Justices-elect Robin
son and Grace. The only reason he
will not be here Monday to assist
them in their rather weighty effort to
move Judges Fisk, Burke and Goss
Is because he Is under contract until
Janiarv 1 with the law college of the
state university.
Inasmuch as none of the present in
cumbents have gone into training for

a legal question only will be raised
Monday.

HINDENBURG A DICTATOR
paper Expresses Belief That He
Forced Resignation of Von Jagow
—Exercises Power.
London, Nov. 30.—A special dis
patch to the Times from Amsterdam
says the reports of the resignation of
Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg are due
probably to the general belief that
Von Hindenburg"s first letter regard
ing the need of the agricultural popu
lation to make sacrifice* for the mu
nition workers was published without
the chancellor's authority.
The Vorwaerts pointed ont that "it
was sent to the press by Herr Bacta
melster, who is not exactly a friend
of the chancellor-"
There seems little doubt, the dis
patch says, that Von Hindenburg in
tends to exercise dictatorial powers in
virtue of his position. It is now be
lieved the resignation of Herr von
Jagow was foroed by Von Hindenburg,
and Count Wedel, instead of succeed
ing Herr Zimmerman, the under sec
retary, was shunted to Vienna. It ap
pears that the chancellor was strong
ly supported by Herr von Jagow, who
at least had a diplomatic manner,
whereas Herr Zimmerman cultivates
a brusque manner in Imitation of the
Blsmarckian tradition.

GREAT U.S. GOLD SUPPLY
SEEN AS PEACE FACTOR
Diplomatic Gossip Holds War With
Japan is Now Out of the
Question.
Washington, Nov. 30.—The mirage
of peace in Europe has contributed
many surprising and paradoxical pre
dictions during the last few days in
diplomatic circles here. One of the
most interesting of these is the set
tled conclusion that now no war with
Japan is at all possible.
After the war the United States
will be the richest country on earth
&nd the immense volume of gold here
will be a most formidable factor for
peace. As long as the United States
holds $1,800,000,000 of gold and adds
to it, the' world's war market will be
slow to finance Japan.
With all her prosperity from war
trade Japan now has as her high wa
