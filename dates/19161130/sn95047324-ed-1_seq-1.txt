A FACT NOT GEN'
ERALLY KNOWN
SHOWN BY CENSUS FIGURES
W.A. McRae, State Commissioner
of Aqticullure, in a Newspaper
Interview Explains Matter
Affecting Our Towns
Florida has no abler or more
persistent booster than William
A. McRae, commissioner of agri
culture. During,, the past few
years, he has contributed to the
press many articles of great val
ue bearing on the advancement
and development of the state. His
latest expressions along this line
were given last Thursday to the
Tallahassee correspondent of the
Tampa Tribune. They contain
views that are both truthful and
highly important, and they
should, therefore, be carefully
read and digested by every cit
izen, male and female. They are
as follows; - -
Referring to census matters, Mr.
McRae called the correspondent's
attention to a fact not generally
known. He said: "During the
census period between 1900 and
1910 nearly 6,000 towns in the li
mited States fell off in population,
a largr drift of people to the big
citicc. . Some of the towns drop
ping behind were" in Florida,
where one town lost 1,610. That
sort of thing means depression in
real estate values, not only in the
losing town but in the surround
ing country, with general los. in
all kinds of values. It means the
same, if not higher, taxes in the
town to maintain itself with de
creased business and smaller pop
ulation. It means lower prices
for the products of the farm. It
means poorer schools and church
privileges, and poor roads. A
town losing in population is usual
ly avoided by people looking for
locations.
"There is a reason for all this,
and one nft potent factor is the
harm wrought by mail order trad
ing. The mail order business has
spread its wings as a thing of evil
over every community, sapping
the commercial and economic life
. . . of home affairs in all parts of the
land. The postmaster at Talla-
hassee will toll you that catalogs,
i;i..et i t
ften beautiful in pictures, with
tempting figures for second rate
goods, come to this office literally
- by thousands of pounds in the
! course of a year. These alluring
! catalogs do'not come directly from
Chicago and New York, but from
i Jacksonville from merely a ship
j ping clerk to get the benefit of
the lower rates of the first and soc
f) ond zones of the pnrcel post, but
the goods come from the big stor-4
es in the centers at the expense of
he buyer. Mail order trading
I'uilds five-acre, stores and Mare
liouses, and the president of one
I f them some time ago paid a mil
lion dollars in cash for a home,
nd this was advertised at the
lime as the largest amount ever
f aid in a single check for that
1'iirposc.
I "The citizens of Tallahasee and
I f Florida helped him buy his pal
Ijtce. Thep helped this same man
Mo give $50,000 to the Republican
t ampaign. They don't know him.
file pays no taxes here. He gives
Mo credit. His name is never
gfound on a subscription paper to
Ifraise funds for an unfortunate
customer, as is the common case
if with the local town merchant. I
could giy,e you scores of reasons
J why the country is sunenng trom
fi this evil, one that is putting dry
ft rot into thousands of towns. To
trade at home is not merely a mat
ter of loyalty and sentiment, but
one of self-interest. A bird in the
hand is worth two in the bush.
One dollar in Florida is better
than two in Chicago or New York.
It is local co-operation that builds
a community: Without it there
is isolation and selfishness and
poverty. It was Carlyle, who
long ago said: 'Men cannot live
isolated.' We arc all bound togeth
er for mutual good or mutual mis
ery, as living nerves in the same
body. No highest can can disunite
himself from the lowest.' "
By-Products of Citrus Fruits
.Washington, D. C. The follow
ing extract regarding some of the
work-done in the interest of the
citrus fruit producers is taken
from the annual report of the bu
reau of ,6'hemistry, U. S. depart
ment of agriculture :
The development of a method
for the manufacture of citrate of
lime from lemons has been com
pleted, while the development of a
method for the manufacture of
citirc acid free from contamina
tion hy heavy metals is well ad
vanced. The manufacture of lem
on oil has been further studied
and the determination of the sea
sonal variations of the oil and. cit
ric acid content of lemons has
been practically- completed for
certain sections of California. A
study of tangerines has shown
that the green fruit has value as
a source of citric acid and that the
oil has commercial possibilities.
The manufacture of marmalade
stock has been undertaken. i
A fine orange vinegar has been
manufactured on a small commer
cial scale which promises to find
a market, though a limited one,
because it costs more to produce
than the usual product. The de
termination of the composition of
Cahtornia oranges with reference
to season, climate, soil, location,
and methods of cultivation has
been completed and the results
are being prepared for publica
tion. The study of the composi
tion of oranges from selected trees
has been of great assistance to the
bureau of plant industry in study
ing bud variations for the pur
pose of making selections in prop
agation experiments. Similar
studies upon grapefruit have been
begun with the bureau of plnn
industry for the purpose of stand
ardizing and improving the vari
eties grown. A study to establish
the range of variation in compo
sition of mature Florida and Cal
ifornia grapefruit has been un
derlaken to be carried through
several seasons. "
Useless Christmas Giving
Editor Jordan strikes a chord
of wisdom and good common sense
in the following:
Christmas has become a night
mare to most bread-winners who
have to pay the cost. Why not
quit giving presents' to any per
sons over fourteen years old and
let people over, that age merely
exchange Christmas cards?
There is no good reason "why
adults should buy and exchange
expensive presents at Christmas
time. Tho season was never in
tended for that purpose. It
stands for an exchange of good
will and good cheer but not of
costly gewgaws. The children,
of course, must have their gifts,
but thev need not be expensive.
The ordinary child derives more
pleasure from a dollar toy than
from a ten dollar ornament.
Christmas giving has been
greatly abused. 'Persons give ex
pensive presents when tluy are
not financial able to pay for them
and when they urgently need the
money for some other purpose.
Many of them take the money
which ought to go to paying their
bills and purchase costly gifts for
relatives and friends. It is . a
false proposition in econom.y It
entails succeeding weeks of de
privation, of being "hard up" for
money for the necessary expenses
of life.
Some day the public will wake
up to the folly of this expensive
Christmas giving and then Editor
Jordan's suggestion will be adopt
ed. Everybody will be happier
afl better off. Tampa Tribune

Thanksgiving
Looking backward through the years to the time when our fore
fathers were establishing in this country institutions that characterize
a great and enduring civilization, there comes to our view no more sig
nificant hall mark -of the fine Christian characteristics of the men and
women of that day than the beautiful custom they began for us in ob
serving a day of thanksgiving and
the blessings of prosperity, peace and happiness that prevail in our
commonwealth and in the nation should be profoundly grateful.
To us has been vouchsafed a year unmarred by epidemic, seriouo
disturbances or economic loss. To
ful enjoyment of the prosperity of the commonwealth ; and a year wit
nessing great progress in our industries and arts of peace. Our fields
and; groves are richly laden with the fruits of industry and are not
laid waste in tho devastating path of war. The busy whirr of the
wheels of commerce have not been supplanted by the rumblings of the
wheels of cannon, the song of the harvester is heard in tho land and we
have no discordant note of strife within our borders. -
Therefore, in keeping with the beautiful custom which it delights
our hearts to follow, I. Park Trammcll, governor of the state of Flori
da, do hereby designate and set apart, . "
THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 1916
to be observed as a day of Thanksgiving. '
; That this nation of ours has been spared the suffering, loss and
bloodshed, yea, even the wholesale slaughter of men, which are the
necessary results of cruel and merciless war; that we have been kept
out of ils awful horrors, yet steadfastly have maintained the national
honor, should fill us with a spirit of solemn gratitude. ' . ,
" For these things and for whatever our individual blessing and
prosperity have been let us bo truly thankful, reverently observing
the day set apart in offering praises and Thanksgiving to The Giver of
all Good who giveth the earth its increase and guides the destinies of
nations.' " .
Let the people gather where convenient for a service of Praise
and Thr nksgiving appropriate to the occasion, and manifest their
gratitude also in substantial form by having thought for any unfor
tunate in their midst. '
In testimony Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused
the great seal of the state to be affixed this 16th day of November, A.

FARM AND GROVE IN FLORIDA 1
Agricultural New Service University of Florida
College of Agriculture t
Farmers Will Receive Money At
Five Per Cent
According to a lecture by Sen
ator' Duncan U. Fletcher at the U
niversity of Florida recently, the
farmers of this country probably
will receive money at five per cent
under the Federal Farm Loan Act.
He said that just before he left
Washington the Farm Loan Board
had received assurance that mil
lions of capital would be available
at 4 per cent. This money will be
invested in bonds issued by Farm
Loan Banks under provisions of
Banks." Under the provisions of
the Act the famers cannot be
charged more than 1 per cent a
bove the interest paid on the
bonds. . J
The bonds are highly desirable
as investments, owing to their
safety and the tax exemptions
which they will enjoy. Investors
will withdraw their money from
loss secure bonds and place, it in
the farm loan bonds. Four per
cent is an attractive rate for large
capital when the solidity of the
bonds is considered, since, these
will be as "safe as those of the Gov
ernment itself.
Men
Trained in
Scarce
Horticulture
Men who are properly trained
in handling fruits and vegetables
are scarce. 1 hey are wanted not
only by public institutions but
by private enterprise. Wells A.
Sherman, of the Office of Markets
and Rural Organizations, said re
cently in a lecture at the Univer
sity of Florida that men with such
training are hard to find. His of
fice is especially desirous of find
ing men Mho are capable of doing
work in fruit and vegetable mar
keting and organizations; but,' ow
ing to the fact that private enter
prises can offer more money, very
few of the agricultural college
graduates who are properly train
ed can be obtained for public ser
vice. It is probable that the fresh
fruit and vegetable business will
continue to grow, because the
markets arc demanding more of
Proclamation
praise. The peoplo of Florida for
us has been given a year of peace
that kind of produce. Students
who begin preparations for that
business will find ready employ
ment as soon as they have finished
college and have obtained the
qualifying experience.
Spray for San Jose Scale in De
cember Spraying for San Jose Scale
should be done when the trees are
dormant. Since peach tres reach
this stage in December, that is the
best month for fighting this pest.
J. R. Watson, entomologist to the
University of Florida Experiment
Station, recommends spraying
with lime sulfur, 1 part of the
commercial solution to $ parts of
water.
Spraying must be done after the
old leaves have fallen and before
the new buds begin to swell to a
void injury to foliage. While De
cember is the time recommended,
late varieties might be sprayed
safely in January, but the early
varieties probably will bo resum
ing growth by that time.
Scale fungus can be introduced
in June next year to take care of
the summer brood.
Seventy-five thousand of the
250,000 students in the institutions
of higher learning of the United
States are studying agriculture,
according to President A. A. Mur
phrce of the University of Flor
ida. This' means that 75,000 per
sons have keen foresight. There
is room for still others because
more than 100,000 agricultural
jubs arc waiting for this army of
students.
Well, we do'not worry if the
Democrats do not control the next
House of Representatives. On
every measure that President Wil
son recommended, , there were
from 40 to 70 progressively inclin
ed Republicans supporting it and
they will do so again, and wc have
the Senate by at least 12 votes.
Republicans in the Senate are
stiff-necked, but in the House they
are afraid to oppose progressive
measures. ,
Ocala Philosophy
The Ocala Star; last, week 'In
dulged in "some sound philosophi
cal musings that 'should have' the
earnest though of every citizen of
Honda Their importance is such
as to demand attention from the
legislature. Some of them are as
follows: . - f '" ' '
"Speaking of the hunting sea
son, it would be a mighty good
thing for Florida if the legislature
would reduce the number of birds
killed to half a dozen a day for
each gunner; or, better still, put
a full stop to shooting all birds cx'-
cept birds of prey for at least five
years. Tho boll weevil ana oth
er insect pests that are ruining
cotton and other crops are here
in direct consequence of the
slaughter, of the birds. ;
There are getting to bo . too
many peoplo for the birds. In the
old days, when population was
scanty, and a double-barreled
muzzle-loader was the most ' for
midable fowling-piece, the feath
ered tribe had a chance. No w-a-days,
not only the, country peo
ple, who are generally moderate,
kill quail, but everybody in town
who can shoot, and many who
can't, goes put and takes a crack
or rather a series of cracks, at the
birds. And with a breechloader
or automatic in the hands of even
an ordinary marksman, the game
hasen't much of a chance.
We human beings are very in
consistent. We abuse a warlike
nation which strives to shut the
gates of mercy on mankind, and
wado through slaughter to a place
in the sun, out we slaughter birds,
beasts and fish not only for our
necessity, but for our amusement.
nd the only right we have to do
this is the right of might.

The southern and eastern drivA

miles southeast of Bucharest, has
boon taken by Field Marehal von
Mackenscn's troops.
Considering the swiftness of the
advance of the Teutonic Allies
through Wallaehia, comparatively
few prisoners have been taken, al
though semi-official reports credit
them with; having captured con
siderable supplies of needed stor
es.,.,. -
Near Orsova twenty-eight of

On the Russian front, there tins
been considerable activity by both
the Russians aud Germans at var
ious points. Comparative calm
prevails all alone the front in
Franco so far as infantry engage

semi-official dispatch says there
are indications . that the Entente
Allies contemplate fresh offensiv
es, probably near Armentieres and
east of Arras, where heavy artil
lery bombardments are being car
ried out, and also on the St. Mihiel
salient southeast of Verdun. '
Another semi-official dispatch
from Berlin quotes Constantinople
advices to the effect that Arabs on
the Tripoli-Tunis frontier in North
Africa have defeated the Italians
and carried the fight across the
border into the Tunis against the
French, The losses of the Italians '
are estimated at 20,000 men, not
