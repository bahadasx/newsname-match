Rev. E. W. Maxedon, the new
pastor of West Hickman Chapel,
arrived her last Saturday from
Lavenia, Tenn., to take up his
pastorial work. Rev. Maxedon is
a young man, unmarried and of
pleasing address, and we're glad
to welcome him to Hickman. He
took charge of the Chapel work
Sunday morning, when he con
ducted his initial service at the
regular hour. Rev. Maxedon
succeeds Reev. J. A. Spence.
The merchants of Hickman who
do not believe in advertising
should take notice to the pack
ages that come into our town on
every mail. How do these people
ge tliis trade? By advertising. It
will bring results to you as it
does to the other people. And
still some turn black in the face
when they see the people trading
with the mail order houses. We
would like to see this town get
all the trade that is coming to it,
but how can we expect it, when
we fold our arms, while our
neighboring towns and the mail
order houses are making the peo
ple at our very door set and take
notice of the things they have to
offer them. A few regular adver
tisers cannot keep some money
from leaving town, but they keep
a lot of it, from going, and we've
noticed, all things being equal,
that the regular advertiser does
the big end of the business in
his line. He not only tell. folk,
what he has to offer them and
the price, but he can generally
be relied upon as having newer,
fresher and more desirable good,
than the tight-wad merchant and
the moss-covered store.
