HUGHES CLOSES
HIS CAMPAIGN
WITH BUSY DAY
Republican Candidate Ad
dresses Five Audiences
Along Hudson River.
AGAIN DRIVES HOME
REPUBLICAN POINTS
Porting Shot Is That U. S.
Must Preserve Honor of
v American Name.
K'
TIM YORK, Nov. 3. Charles E.
Hughes ended his travels as a
pit -..entlal candidate here tonight.
The nominee spent the day Journeying;
down the Hudson river valley from
v Alliar.y. lie delivered five speeches
, on tne way and after his arrival here
l ud dressed throe meetings In Brooklyn.
' In his speech toduy Mr. Hughes
I spoke chiefly on the tnrlff and the
maintenance of American rights
abroad, lis also assailed the admin
istration for "broken promises" with
respect to the reduction of the cast
1 of lllng, the observance of the merit
system in making appointment, the
mulntcnance of American rights
abroad and economy in the expenses
of government.
Conditions which Industry in the
United States will face at the close ot
the war were characterized as cause
for "terious consideration by every
student of our affairs".
Watch for Headache.
"We want to look out that we do
not have a headache coming to us In
the near future," the nominee told an
audience at Newbnrgh, "because there
are quite a number of things that we
must carefully consider."
Among the chief of theso, Mr.
Hughes ranked commercial competi
tion after the closo of the Kuropean
war, "not nt all wasted by war, but
disciplined, organized as thty have
never been before . Tne unuerwooa
tariff, Mr. Hughes said, would not
meet the situation as 4 measure ot
Protection to American lndtielry.
"Our opponents told us four years
ago, Mr. -Hughe said at Kingston,
"of the wonderful opportunities tnuj
were going to give the Amerlean busi
ness. We know what actually fol
lowed. I do not mean that they were
Insincere. I simply mean tnat whnt
thoy think fitted American life does
net work with It "
can't I'hhh taws.
Mr. Hughes said he. asked his oppo.
- nents what they were going to do
about safeguarding American Industry
and they replied that they had a tariff
commission. A tariff commission, ho
continue (lid not pans laws.
"I do not blame them," he said, "for
their continued adherence to the old
policy which through the generations
they have maintained and the doc
trine which In platform after plnt
foim they have asserted. I really In
a sense admire theii tenacity and the
way In which they ignore the facts of
life In their constancy of spirit."
It was no time, Mr. Hughes de
clared, for his political opnonents to
be "sensltlva about criticism".
'We are taking account of stock."
he said. "Our opponents seem to have
the Idea that there ought not to he
any criticism nf the administration;
well, we would not do very well In
American life und"r our Institutions If
we went ahead In that way. We want
fair criticism. Wo want cmdld criti
cisms, but we must conserve the op-
" portunitios of American life and the
honor of the American name."

It Is charged that an unproportlon
nte share of the county's rotd fund Is
being spent for the Improvement of

state, thoy believe is due to the fact
that one of tho commissioners owns

had differences with the county com
missioners for some time. Several
months agj an agitation was started
in Dawson for a new road to Tulsa
which would parallel the Frisco rail
road tracks. This was denied by thu
county commissioners on tho ground
that the road was unnecessary. D.tw

Forewarned Now.
A MPLE evidence that crookedness
ITL and unfairness featured the reg
istration, which closed last week. Is
In the hands of the Republican county
central committee and every precau
tion Is being taken to have the polls
guarded heavier than ever before at
tho coming election to see that not
one of tho hundreds of illegally
registered Dernnomis put anything

Since the closo of the registration
the Republicans procured complete
lists of every man registered an?
workers have been put on the Job to
check off tho men who will be
watched and challenged when they
appaer to vote.
There Is not a precinct in the entire
county where Irregularities have not
been found.
In one precinct alone 25 illegal
voters, all Democrats, were discovered
In the poll list. Four of ther. wore
registered from vacant lots wlsrs
there never has boen even a tent.
Seven others gave the registrar ad
dresses but when the Republicans ap
peared at the purported homes of t!:e
seven they were told they had never
heard of their names.
Another Demo with a name like a
Persian rug was found not to he a
resident of the city but a traveling
man who expected to drop off here
election day to "help the boys."
Watch "Reixatlng."
Several have not been In the state
the required length of time and others
do not live In the precinct. The pur
pose of this Is believed to permh
"repeating."
Four of the Demos In the same pre
sinct were found to have been within
the lines less than two weeks.
There are 47 precincts In Tulss
county. While tho Republicans do not
claim to know all that was practiced
by tho registrars, there Is a large
bundle of evidence lit the safe ut

Three Jitneurs Arrested
by Officers for Violat

THE right of Jitneys to operate
while their appeal to the state
supreme court is pending was denied
by Judge T. P. Clay of the district
court yesterday.
Following the refusal of an injunc
tion uguinst city officials t pre. nt
their enforcing the new Jitney ordi
nance, the Jitney men announced they
would appeal. The temporary re
straining order, through which the city
had been checked from enforcing the
ordinance, was. also revoked. At
torney for the Jitney owners claimed
that the restraining order held good
while the appeal was pending.
In refusing to continue the restrain
ing order Judge Davis held that the
order Issued by Judfte llrecklorldge of
the superior court was only tempo
rary nnd was not an InJunctic n.
"fhree Jitney drivers were arrested
yesterday bv tho police for violating

Henderson and Sturgls were re

Many of the Jitneys were operating
xesterday under tne aonution plan.
They run on their regulur routes with
the signs removed but no "charge" Is
made. However, pussengcrs who di-
sire to "donate" tho customary 5 cents
will not have their offerings refused.
City officials frown upon this
method of evading the Jitney regula

will follow If the. Jitneurs persist In
the practice. ...
Some of the Jitney drivers say they
are tired of the fight and aro ready t
take out licenses under the new ordi

licenses were received by tne city

BERLIN. Nos. 3. (By wireless to
Sayvllle) Tho relchstag today dis
cussed the treatment of war prisoners.
Prince von Kchoenaloh of tho National
Liberal party, says the Overseas News
agency, made a report on the pro
ceedings of the commltteo which con
sidered that question as follows:
"With great sadness and profound
indignation the comlmttee took notice
of the great sufferings of Germans
made prisoners. This Is especially
truo of Russia where numerous cares
of brutal treatment have been proved
and also In British camps from which
there are numerous complaints. Pris
oners are often forced to work under
degrading conditions. Frequently they
must toll In 40 degrees of cold or
under a burning sun and often physi
cal brutality Is added to this. Tho
food Jn many places Is most scanty,
deficient and badly prepared."
Prince von Schoonalch acknowl
edged the kind exertions of the Holy
See to improvo the fate of tho pris
oners, continues the news agency.
Mathius Krzberger, leader of the
clerical center, expressed thanks to
the Pope and the population of Switz
erland for humane actions toward war
pilsoners.
;iv SHmc Truilincnt.
The whole house agreed, says the
agency, that Germans would be glad
If their countrymen made prisoners
were treated everywhere as well us
wur prisoners In Germany.
Herr Bruckhoff, radical member,
stated :
"We havo heartrenderlng reports
from one camp on the Murom rail
road (Siberia), where In a small .ined
with room for fifty persons, 150 to
200 war p'isoners were housed, halt
naked nnd forced to do heavy lalwir.
In consequence of this barbaric treat
em some have died nnd others de
clared that they were unable to stay
In tho same house with the corpses,
but the commander declined to bury
the dead."
Herr von Hoehm, a conservative
member, says the agency, stated thnt
a while ago defenseless German war
prisoners were shot by the French
under command of French officers.
Major General Frlcdrich slated, ac
cording to the nsw agency, that the
German authorities gladly would close
tne cunip where LrliiHh clvli prisoners
are Interned and would release them
all provided England would accept tho
Gernian proposal and exchange ull

11 (lore Roosevelt criticised Presi
dent Wilson in emphatic words this
evening in an address at Cooper union
which hu delivered ut the request of a
campaign organization of business
men who oppose tho re-election ot
Mr. Wilson. Taking as his subject
"Our Nation's Crisis," Colonel Roose
velt said that a world cataclysiq has
overwhelmed civlllzaton und that
"the times have needed a Washington
or a Lincoln, but unfortunately we
have been granted only another
Buchanan."
"1 have been assailed," said the
speaker, "because I have criticised
Mr. Wilson. I have not suld one
thing of him that was not absolutely
accurate und truthful. 1 havo criti
cised him because I believe hu has
drugged In the dust what was most
sacred 111 our past and him Jeopar
dized tho most vital hopes of our
future. I crlU' lse him because hu has
adroitly und cleverly und with slnater
ability appealed to ull that It Weakest
ami most unworthy In tho American
character and ulso because he has
sought to lead many men und women
who ure neither weuk nor unworthy,
but who have been misled by a
shadow dance with words. Ho has
kept tho eyes of tho people dazzled so
they know not what is real und what
Is false. In the fuce of tho world ho
has covered this nation's face with
shame as with u garment.
"1 hardly know whether to feel the
most burning ludrgnatlon at those
speeches of his wherein he expresses
lofty sentiment which his deeds belie;
or at those other speeches wherein
he displays a frank cynicism of belief
in and appeal to what Is basest In tho
humun heart
"In a recent speech at Long Beach,
he suld, as reported in the dally press,
that 'yoii cannot worship God on an
empty stomach and you cannot be a
patriot when you are starving.'
Is Sordid Truth.
"No more sordid untruth was ever
uttered. Such a sentence could be
uttered only by a president who care
nothing for the nation's soul und who
believes that the nation Itself puts Its
belly above Its soul. I cull the at
