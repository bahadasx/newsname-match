No. 29.492. WASHINGTON, D. C., SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1916?EIGHTEEN PAGES. ONE CENT.
WORK ON MESSAGE
WILL START SOON
V
President to Take Up Recommendations
to Congress on
Return Here Next Week.
MAY DISCUSS EMBARGOES
President Wilson will begin worl
upon his annual message to Congress
almost immediately after his return t<
Washington the last of next week, 1
was learned today. Owing to his politi
cal activities, together with the regu
lar routine work of his office, lie has
been unable to do more than give pass
Ing thought to what he will discuss ii
the message or address, because he wil
probably follow his custom and per
sonally deliver the recommendations h<
will make to Congress.
Although official verification is no
obtainable of a private report that th<
President will discuss with Congress
the placing of an embargo on wheat
flour and probably other food supplies
there is a constantly growing: opinioi
In official circles that this subject ii
likely to be a most important one in tin
coming Congress and that Presiden
Wilson may lead the way by a recom
mendation on the question.
It is recognized that it might be s
great political blunder for the Presi
dent to announce his position on tin
subject now, but whether he is or i
Ha will Ha free to exDresi
his mind about an embargo after Tues
day of next week. The attitude of th?
administration in the past .has beei
that exports from this country are no
to be Stopped, but the administratioi
has not before been confronted with a
situation exactly like this one, when
millions of consumers are growing im
patient each day under the r: pidly ris
ing prices for the commonest, plaines
necessities of life.
Consumer Smarts Keenly.
The inevitable difference in viewpoint
between the producer and th<
consumer has generally gone along
without legislative or official considera
tion in the past, the producer being
more thoroughly organized and insist
ent upon his rights, but it was state*
today bv government officials that al
reports indicate that the consumer. th<
unresisting victim, has .begun to smart
keenly under the big rise in prices o:
everything he must live upon, espe
cially flour and those things which, i
kept at home, would not cost so much
In the event of President Wilson's
re-election, he would be in a position o
greater 'political independence to pres:
for a solution of the food question, embargoes
included, than if defeated,
ing out of office next March, witi
the possibilities of.his renomination bj
h i party tokr yeafrom now in mind
he %-ould naturally be inclined to leav<
the repubiicau&^to worry with the tvoi|<
*??les coming up. Re-elected, with further
presidential ambition removed, h<
would bo in position to press sharpij
for whatever legislation he believe*
siiould be enacted for the benefit of th<
atest. number of people.
Willi Ul? VIIUDDIUU VI i wujmviiuu.
tions upon a. proposed embargo fron
his message, the President's sugges
tions to Congress ar*? not likely to b<
extensive at the coming session, whicl
will be a short one, mainly devoted t<
appropriations. Even if the sessioi
were a long one, the President wouli
probably not have an extensive pro
gram of recommendations, it is said 01
good authority. The President is on
derstood to feel that the democrat:
have given the country sufficient con
atructive legislation in tbe last thre<
years to last for a while and thht ther?
is no need to press so vigorously fo
further important enactments. Th
democrats generally take a simila
view. Should the republicans be sue
cessful they will want to overhaul rnos
of the work done by the democrats ani
will naturally be quite busy for th
next four years.
Railroad Strikes to Come Up.
One of the really big things the Presi
dent has promised to take up with Con
gress is that of railroad strikes. Whil
the threatened railroad strike was re
cently pending the President asked Con
gress to put through legislation tha
would prevent strikes or lockouts unt!
a thorough investigation had been mad
for the public's Information. He ha
promised to urge this and other legisia
tion regarding industrial conditions a
the coming session.
As to trust laws Mr. Wilson told th
business world that It had obtained free
dom from further legislation when th
Clayton anti-trust law went througl
The democrats are satis tied with th
federal reserve act, and will make fe\
amendments to the present laws, it i
*aidL Mr. Hughes would make many, i
he came in.
80 far as the District of Columbia goe
the President will have no recommenda
tions to make. it Is said. He has no
Included the District in his legislatlv
program at any time during his admin
lstration. He has left the handling ?
District affairs to the District Comm!aioners
and has done nothing personal!
to interfere with the imposition upon th
Idstrict of any sort of law a congress
man with j>ersonal vagaries as to th
District could get through. He ha
vetoed none of the objectionable legisia
tion that has passed. He has taken th
jXHtitioii thaf lie did not understand Dis
trict affairs well enough to place hi
Judgment against that of Congress.

t German Admiralty Reports
Destruction of Submarine by
Masquerading Patrol Boat.
r SURVIVORS "ILL TREATED"
i
By the Associated Press.
BERLIN, November 4, by wireless to
> the Associated Press, via Sayville, N.
s Y.?The German admiralty has furl
nished to the Associated Press correi
spondent the details of what is characterized
as a second Baralong case, in
n which a British patrol ship, flying
e American colors, it is- declared, after
.r destroying submarine U-41, deliberatei
ly ran down a rowboat with the only
two survivors of the undersea boat in
y an endeavor to remove the only wit>
nesses and has since prevented the in3
tended victims, who were almost min
raculously saved, from communicating
>r the news to their own government.
The incident, according to the admiralty,
occurred on September 24, 1915,
and has only just been learned of
J? through an invalid prisoner transferred
[? to Switzerland. The submarine, ac"y
cordiner to the admiralty account, had
y halted in the neighborhood of the
ie Scilly Isles for examination a steamer
under the American flag, apparently an
innocent merchantman.
Jt American Flag Kept Flying.
r" The steamer ostensibly prepared to
lower a boat, but when the submarine
had approached to within 300 yards
the supposed merchantman suddenly
opened concealed ports and began firing
from two cannon and also with
rifles, the American flag flying the
whole time, the account continues.
>h The submarine, Irreparably damaged,
st went under, but was able to come to
the surface later for an instant, Lieut.
Crompton, severely wounded, and Petty
Lo Officer Godau managing to crawl out
through an open hatch before the subnt
marine sank forever.
_ The sole survivors ultimately managed
to swim to an empty boat. The
steamer observing this, according to
t- the admiralty details, headed full
k speed for the boat, not to save, but to
're ram it, placing a lookout in the steamLg
er's bow to facilitate accurate steering.
The Germans at the last moment
sprang from the boat and clung to the
wreckage of it for a half hour, when
the steamer finally picked them up.
m
>f Without Medical Attention.
The wounded Lieut. Crompton and
^ Ulo /vA?ira.1a nrora In#* tVio
18 slightest medical attention in a small
cage on the steamer's deck until her
arrival at Falmouth the following day,
a it I*-declared, although the. lieutenant
re- -had a double fracture of the jawbone,
a broads wound across the nosei~
cheek, wounds in the left temple and
te on the finger and an eye shot out. It
was not until September 29 that the
ia lieutenant was transferred, to a shore
hospital, clad at the time only in his
underclothing, being transferred on
November 6 to the military prison in
York Castle, whence the wounded officer,
whose w'ounds were still open
and who was threatened with the loss
of the other eye, was sent in mid-DeS
cember to Dyffryn, Wales, the account
states.
;s Detained in England.
?n A British surgeon later proposed to
r- transfer the wounded officer, as totally
t, invalided, to Switzerland, and a Swiss
is commission of surgeons twice voted
that he be thus sent; but the British
is surgeon general, it is declared, vetoed
it the plan, and the officer was retained
;y in England.
in The admiralty declares that this was
l" evidently due to a guilty conscience on
j3 the part of the British, who wished to
?- prevent the news from being made
0. known. Lieut. Crompton repeatedly atet
tempted to send his report through the
,y American embassy in London, it is as n
serted, but no report from him reached
Id Germany.
it An admiralty officer, recalling the
ie newspaper reports of some time ago
ie that the British government, having
f. been forced by German retaliatory
n measures to abandon drastic treatment
re of captives from submarines, had given
r{ orders to take no submarine prisoners,
r_ but to send them to the bottom with
their "Vessels, declared to the corre^
spondent that this case, with that of the
Baralong, should be considered as furnishing:
all necessary proof that the
undented story regarding the'governDment
order was true.
The submarine U-41 was commanded
Nby Lieut. Commander Hansen, accounted
one of the bravest and best of German
submarine officers.

Tremors in Alabama Hay Have
Been Dne to Mine Explosion.
BIRMINGHAM. Ala., November 4.?A
distinct earthquake tremor was felt
here at 6:15 o'clock this morning:, the
local weather bureau announced. Windows
were rattled and china^cnocked
from the cupboards of several homes.
No earth tremors were recorded on
the seismographs of Georgetown University
this morning. Seismological
Observatory Director Tondorf expressed
the opinion that the earth tremor
felt in Birmingham was the result of
a change in the earth's contour resulting
from the mine explosion near there
this morning. He pointed out that
earth tremors might occur after such
an explosion within a mine, especially
if the force of the explosion was very
great, and that its effect might be felt
at some distance, with the change being
noted some time after the occur ance.

PRESIDENT CLOSES
CAMPAIGN TODAY'
Addresses Fellow-Citizens of
New Jersey at "Old Home
Day" Celebration.
PARKER SEES LANDSLIDE
By the Associated I*ress.
LONG BRANCH, N. J? November 4.?
President Wilson, at an "old home day"
celebration here today, planned to close
his campaign for re-election with an address
this afternoon to his fellow-citixens
of New Jersey.
Special trains were engaged to bring
to Shadow Lawn residents of Jersey
City, Newark, Trenton and other sections
of New Jersey, and the Wilson managers
said many more democrats would
come by automobile.
To his friends here early today the
President expressed confidence over the
outcome of the election Tuesday. He
was expected to sum up his views of the
situation in his afternoon address, and
also to devote part of the speech to the
New Jersey situation.
The attack made on the President last
night by Col. Roosevelt went witnout ^
official notice here today, although it was
said Mr. Wilson might allude to it indirectly
this afternoon. Thus far he has
mentioned neither Col. Roosevelt nor Mr.
Hughes by name in any of his speeches.
President Wilsori was assured today
by John M. Parker, progressive candidate
for Vice President, that progressives
throughout the middle and western
states were coming to the President's
support, and that "the elements
of a landslide are appearing."
Mr. Parker's Telegram.
Mr. Parker telegraphed from Michigan
to Mr. Wilson the following:
"Permit me to extend congratulations
in advance on your re-election, which
appears to be assured. The progressives
throughout the middle and western
states are coming strong to your
support, and the elements of a landslide
are approaching. We have just
concluded a three-day tour of Michigan
in part on a special train, and are
thus enabled to forecast a tremendously
heavy vote here from progressives
as a tribute to your splendid leadership.
Indeed, it is our candid judgment
that even this old-time republican
state will probably return its electoral
vote in your favor. It is not too much
to say it looks that way."
C. W. Watson, democratic national
committeeman from "West Virginia,
telegraphed the President, saying a
careful canvass of his state showed it
would go democratic. Senator Walsh
of Montana, in charge of western dem- .
ocratic headquarters at Chicago, sent

FOR ELECTION RIGHT.
Baa on Certain Avenue Traffic Likely
to Be lined.
District officials are considering- plans
for the safety of cltiaens who traverse
Pennsylvania avenue Tuesday night
reading election returns. An order
probably will be Issued prohibiting vehicular
traffic along the Avenue between
10th and 14th streets. Street
cars, however, will be permitted to
operate.
It is expected that automobiles will
be permitted to park on all streets
south of the avenue except C and D
streets, which are occupied by street
car tracks and are now undergoing repairs.
Instructions to the police in the.
matter are expected to be issued today
| or Monday.
BEAN BAGS TO COST MOBE.
Suggestion in Chicago That Cherry .
Pits Be Substituted, Unpopular.
CHICAGO, November 4.?The bean
bag", which for many years has been a
feature of play in the public schools
of the country, is today the latest
victim of high prices. The proposal
of a bean bag maker to a committeo ~
of the Chicago board of education to
substitute cherry pits for the old-fash- ion
navy bean in the manufacture of_
bags appeared to be in favor with the
board of education committee until Mrs.
George P. Vosbrink, a member, arrived
at the session yesterday slightly late.
"We will make ourselves ridiculous .
by adopting such a suggestion," said
Mrs. Vosbrink. "The children do not
eat the beans, and if enough cannot
be liad to fill bean bags, the pupils
can get along without them until such
a time as they do not cost so much."
The committee deferred action on the
proposal.
GOLD SENT TO ARGENTINA.
$1,450,000 Is Shipped From New
York Banks.
NEW YORK, November 4.?Tlie
steamer Byron, leaving today for
Buenos Aires, carries a shipment of
$1,450,000 gold from local banking In
| stitutions. m tnis sum *j.,vw,vyv w?.o
j sent by a trust company, presumably in
connection with British purchases or
supplies in Argentina. The remainder,
representing two transactions, one of
$250,000 and the other of 1269,400, was
exchange business.
The movement of gold to Argentina
was indicated recently by the rise of
Argentine exchange to a point where it
was niore profitable to remit gold than
to send funds by check or cable.
