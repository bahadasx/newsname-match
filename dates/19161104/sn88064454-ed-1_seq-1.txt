WAR PRICES.
If the general Lprosplerity i ciaus.
ed by the war. how is that the su.
gar producers of Louisiana with
the war still going on are legging
the trust to buy a portion of its
preducts? How is it with the war
still going on the prices for sugar
when the cane planters have cane
are not as good as when they have
no cane to sell, in the nine other
months of the year? Is it not high
time for people to do their own
thinking. and cease swollowing
this protection fudge and bunc,
that protect the favored few, gives
special privileges to a select few,
and denies equal rights to all.
Think it over and and vote for
Wade 0. Martin.
