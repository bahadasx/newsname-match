ELECT WILSON
BEAT THIS PLAN
Proposed Park Consolidation Should Be
Defeated Because It Is a Blow at
the People and Parks.
Tho Citizens' League to Conscrvo
Chicago's 1'nrkH completed Its orgnn
IziUlon and laid out u plan of cum
pnlgn to bring nbout tho defeat of
park coiiHolItliitloii nt tho November
election.
Tho oxccutlvo committee, com
posed ot Dr. (Inihnin Taylor, Miss
Mary McDowell, Dwlght H. Perkins,
William II. Duscli, and Allun II. Pond,
announced tho Iciiriio proposes to do
all In Its power to achieve tho fol
lowing purposes:
"Appraise tho voters both inon atul
women of tho Importance of tho
park consolidation Issuo at this time
and of tho various provisions' of tho
bill to consolidate Chicago's local
governments within tho city govern
ment. "Inform tho voterH as to tho word
ing of tho park consolidation ballot
and its position on tho little ballot.
"Point out to tho general public tho
dangor to tho park, playground, and
boulevard systems should tho consoli
dation bill bo adopted now.
"And, Irrespective ot our belief In
consolidation, urge every voter to
voto 'no' nt tho coming election, Nov.
7, on tho so-called park consolidation
moasuro, In order that the entire ques
tion can bo intelligently acted upon
Inter when circumstances are more
fuvornblo."
Tho executive commlttco, which
was authorized to solicit funds and
conduct the campaign, was named at
u luncheon given by tho loaguo In tho
Hotel La Salle. Tho leaguo'H mem
bership comprises n largo group ot
Chicago's civic loaders, some of
whom nro opposed to park consoli
dation under any clrcumstnncos and
soma who oppose It under tho present
city administration.
Gcorgo C. Sykes declared his "solo
nnd only reason" for lighting tho bill
wns "lack of confldonco In tho city ad
ministration." This evoked some hot
romarks from W. N. Rudd, president
of tho Chicago Horticultural society,
who assorted tho bill ItBolf Is "rotten
to the coro." Ho nverred tho bill
would mnko tho proposed park board
"scramble for monoy" llko tho ctato
unlvorslty, that It would permit tho
city council to sell tho city's parks,
and that it would throw -1,000 em
ployes, now protected by civil service,
Into politics.
"It would bo ruinous for tho public
library," added Clrnhnm Taylor. "Tho
library needs continuous and Intollt
gout supervision; park consolidation
would placo It nt tho morcy of somo
council commlttco, and tho library
would bo thrown Into tho scrnmblo for
funds."
Among thoHO who woro present

TAX AMENDMENT
"Every housoholdor and ovory con
sumer in Illinois should unlto In see
ing that tho pending tax amoudmont
to the constitution is voted for by
every man who goes to tho polls Nov.
7," said President Paul sfolnbrochor
of tho Chicago Real Estate bonrd.
"Undor our prosent unworkable sys
tem, real estate, Including tho homes
and tho farms of Illinois, bears over
70 per cent of tho total tax burden.

Intauglblo wealth bears less than r,
por cent. This undue and unequal
burden Increases tho cost of living
and tends to rnlso rents.
"On tho other band, tho owner of
Intangible personal property money,
stocks, bonds, and mortgagos Is
threatened with coullscntlon ot n third
or u half or mora of Income from in
vestment, If lie obeys tho law. As n
result, only tho helpless, like tho wid
ows, whoso holdings becomo public
through proceedings of tho Probato
court, feel tho cruel forco ot our un

It is said downstato roports are fu
vornblo to tho nmondmont.

It also represents the plurality for
Governor Dunne and other state can

Tho Republicans will havo a Hllght

more than offset this."
Mr. Dalley said his estimates weio
