For sentimental reason*, he wishes to
make his last campaign address to the
people of the State in which he began
his uolitical career.
Many in ??y? President's audience to
morrow will be political and personal
friends of long standing. For this rea
son. he has promised to state his views
more completely than before during
tlio campaign. Meritocrats from <lifrf|
ent parts of New Jersey have ar
ranged to <-ome on spcclal trains.
In his speech. the President will
express cojiliiienee in the outcome of
tin- voting next Tuesday. Mr. Wilson
has no engagements before election,
lie feels that the issues arc made up,
and that most of tiic people have de
termined how they will vote.
After his return from New York to
day. the President received a message
from Victor f'arl.Mrnm, the aviator,
who made a flight from Chicago to
New York. hearing a letter to Mr.

Chicago.

Captain Tunney said that the $50 was
part of the collections which strikers
have been taking up iu the streets
when they appeared with hand organs
and appealed for funds. In this way,
the appropriation was kept off the

men carrying it alighted, the confes

burned two and a half minutes, giv
ing the dynamiters a change to get to
the street before, the explosive went off,
two minutes after a train carrying pas
sengers had left the station, "'he men
then escaped into Central Park, and
j it was in climbing over a wall that
j one of the men dropped the dynamite
' which furnished the clue.
The arrest of the alleged dynamiters

WASHINGTON, November 3.?An of -
llt'ial estimate tliiit Co,000 ncurocs have
been transported recently from the
South into Ohio, Indiana, Illinois ami
other States was made by tnDepart
ment of Justice to-night, in a state
ment declaring that a number of the
mcrn'-s have fraudulently registered,
and that other election frauds dis
closed include padding of registration
lists, reaching into thousands of false
names in one city alone.
The statem?nt, issued with the sanc
tion ? of Attorney-General Gregory,
gives warnintr that conspirators to in
timidate voters will be promptly prose
cuted. It is the department's lirst of
ficial announcement thai actual cases
of fraud have been developed by its
invest I gators.
"Among other provisions of laws,"
says the statement, "section 10 of the
penal rode makes it an offense against
the United States for two or more
persons to conspire to intimidate any
citizen in the free exercise or enjoy
ment of any right or privilege secured
to him by the Constitution or laws of
tlie United States, or to punish him f-jr
having exercised such right, and the
courts have held that one of the riuhts
so secured is the right to vote for
Federal otlicers, and have the votes
fairly counted and the result correctly
returned.
DKVKLOI'M 15 NTS WILL. HKSUI.T
IX PROMPT IMiOSKCUTIONS
"Conspiracies to intimidate voters in
the free exercise of the right to vote
for Federal otlicers arc violations of ]
Federal law. Such a conspiracy noed
not he consummated, and even an overt
act i.s not essential, nor Is intimidation
confined to acts of physical violence.
The development of such conditions
will result in prompt prosecutions.
"United States district attorneys and !
investigators have been instructed to !
I)** fair and nonpartisan in investiga- i
lions and prosecutions.
"Information received by the lie- i
partment of Justice shows that within
the last three months, approximately
CO.OuO negroes have been transported
from certain Southern States;to North
ern and Western States, ^inainly to
Middle Western States, particularly
Ohio. Indiana and Illinois. Investiga
tion has developed the fact that a t
number of these negroes have reg- i
istered in violation of the laws of the |
States to which they have gone.
"Some information has been de- !
veloped indicating plans in different
States to violate the Federal statutes
with reference to election in other
ways, such as registration of. non
naturulized citizens, false registration,
false counts and returns by election
boards, entering on the poll books as
having voted fictitious persons, or per
sons who have failed to vote, intimida
tion in various forms, including that
by employers of their employees
through threats which tend to coerce
the will of the employees.
"Facts in the possession of the de
partment show in one city the padding
of registration lists with fictitious
names to an extent which, in the light
of accurate information already ob
tained. Indicates tluit the number of
such false names probably reaches into
the thousands.'*
