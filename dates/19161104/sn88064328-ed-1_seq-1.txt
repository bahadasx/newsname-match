while in 11116 the highest quoted

here is about $3.50 per barrel.
Mr. Eignua, secretary of the
^ ce growers' Association was
.quoted by the Enterprise in a
I news item as stating that about
'all farmers who had to sell, had
|sold what he calls "Distressed
rice" and that the price of those
who had held their rice would be
raised ten cents a barrel after
November 1st. Remember this
was after the price had already
advanced more then the ten cents.
If the Association would »lo jus
tiee to the farmer there would be
no "distressed"' rice. If jt was
what it ought to be for the farmer
it would fix the nrice at the be
ginning of the season and the
bank holding the "Distressed"
farmer 's paper would extend it
until the mills would pay the
orice. Under the democratic
banking law the farmer can ob
tain six oer cent money and hold
his riee for ttfe highest price.
Since my first communication
on thia subjcct I have been aaked
by many, what interest I have in
the welfare of the riee frimer. I

THIS IS IMPORTANT, MK.
VOTER.
Mr. Voter, look at your ballot
carefully. Amendment to Arti
cle 210 makes it possible to hav.
women on school and eharitabb*
boards. ^ ou know how import
ant it is that children have ;i
mother's care in the home ,;ud this
same care is equally ncee -sary in
the school. Looking after chil
dren is peculiarly a woman's job
so our schools need the help of
women in their Boards. Then
take our asylums and hospitals.
Can vou run these well without
women to help? Other states
have found out th$t women nre
neenliarlv fitted to serve on Pub
lie Boards, and Louisiana women
are as able ns those of anv other
state. _ Vote ves to the Amend
ment to Article 210.
