Circuit Judge Ashford on FYIday no-
tified the members of the jury that
they would be wanted In court Mon

matters pertaining to Iwilol were re
relveJ by Juds;e Afihford on Friday in
a letter from City Attorney Arthur M.
Brown. - ' -
The letter, whlcJi Is self-explanatory
and wlvich was made public by Judge
Ashford and City Attorney Brown to
day, is as follows:
"In view of the recent agitation
against, and more or less publicity
concerning the so-called 'Iwilel dis-
trlet," wherein It is generally under
stood that prostitution, under certain
regulations concerning health and the
maintenance .of. law and order, is be
ing carried on, and in view of the
furtHer fact that this office may be
called upon by certain citizens oppos
ed to the maintenance of any suh re
stricted district, to prosecute all such
offenders and the owners ofithe proiv
erty used for the purpose of public
prostitution within such district.
- Public Opinion Divided"
.'And la view further that public
opinion is apparently divided as to
whether such a. restrilted district
should be tolerated as It' has been in
, the past, as . a so-called 'necessary
jMl,' I would eiy respectfully request
that this entire matter be made the
iubject of a most thorough investiga
tion by the grand Jury of this circuit,
lid their attention called to the Fame
AJy you officially, with the end in view
lht such grand Jury, as representing
public opinion in so far as the enforce
ment of law, and order Is concerned
may make such recommendations con
cernlng the abolition or maintenance
of this so-called 'restricted district' as
will enable this office and the police
department, working together to car
ry cut to the fullest extent the recom
mendations of this body of public citi
zens concerning this alleged evil and
all matters connected therewith." .
Ahin In Police Court
Y. Ahin, alleged owner of disorderly
houses in Iwilel, was arrested yes
. terday and arraigned in police court
this morning an J then developed what
may prove to be a feature of the en
. tire effort to close the disorderly dis
trict It appeared that the city and
county . attorney's office will refuse
to allow any .handling of the case ex
cept by its own staff.
Robert W. Creckons, who has been
engaged as counsel b the anti-vice
committee, appeared In jcourt and said
that at the instance or several reput
able gentlemen of the community he
. has been asked to look after the legal
aspects of the fight on Iwilel and that
he had requested of the city attorn
ey's office to allow him to appear as
assisting in the prosecution of the
cases which might be brought up. He
said indications- were that the city
' attorney would refuse to allow this.
W Breckons said later that he would
J JWress a letter to City Attorney
Urown to ascertain the latter's exact
attitude.
Ahin was arrested and released on
his own recognizance without bail.
Rose Exp!ain$ Position
Although some houses were dark
last night, Iwilel showed little sign
of a general closing, most of the in
mates now awaiting the outcome of
the Ahin case.- Sheriff Rose says he
has been asked by several inmates of
that district if the police were going
to close their places and that he told

and Will Conduct Meetings
; Today and Monday
Because he has found that a large
majority of the voters know compara
tively little about the municipal bond
issue, Mayor John C. Lane, has started
a whirlwind windup campaign to en
lighten the people and educate them
In order that they may vote intelli
gently. Lane has gathered a large
number of prominent speakers togeth
er and today and Monday they will
talk to the voters. ;
At.l o'clock today Supervisor Ar
nold, Building Inspector Freitas and
DL. Conkling spoke at Kaneohe, and
Monday noon there will be rallies at
the Honolulu Iron Works and Ritchie
Construction Camp, and a monster ral
ly Monday night at Aala Park.
Mayor Adds Drawing Cards
The mayor is planning: several at
tractions for Monday evening, among
which are the Hawaiian band quintet
club, and seats will be provided for all.
The grand stand will be gaily decorat
ed with flags and built high enough
for the speakers to be easily heard.
Friday Mayor Lane wrote to both
the Republican and Democratic com
mittees asking permission to speak
from their platforms. In his reply,
Harry Murray Baid,"I beg to advise
you as vice-chairman of the Republi
can Territorial central committee, that
there is no objection on our part to
a discussion of the municipal bond is
sue, both pro and con, from the plat
form used by the candidates, provided,
however, that the bond discussion
takes places after the candidates and
party workers have addressed the
voters." No reply has been received
from the Democrats. ;
Goes Right Ahead
The mayor feels, however, that he
cannot accept the offer of Murray, for
the reason that when the candidates
are through it will be too late, and
he has therefore decided to have a
platform of his own. - The speakers
Monday night will be: Chairman Chas.
F, Chillingworth, Hon. J. K. Kalani
anaole. delegate; David Kalauokalani,
John H. Wise, William C. Achi, W. R.
Farrington, A. L. C. Atkinson, A, M.
Brown, Chas. H. Holoua, Moses Ka
hue. Mayor J. C. Lane and Supervisors
Ahla, Arnold, Hollinger, Horner, Lar
sen and Logan.
In speaking of the meeting Monday
evening Mayor Lane said: "It is not
the purpose of the meeting to interfere
with the other meetings, but I hold
that the people should be enlightened
and educated upon the bond issue in
order that when they go to the polls
the next day. they may vote intelli
gently for or against, it ,
Part of Education Campaign
. "The meeting is principally a cam
paign for education, for I know the
necessity of such a campaign. ; In
talking with many "whom I believed
knew something about the bond issue,
their answers have fully convinced
me that they even do not know .that
they are to vote for it next Tuesday,
as they are of the belief that the elec
tion takes place next year.
"Knowing this to be the fact it has
made me more determined than ever
to talk on this vital iEsue, and since
it is the first election held of such a
public nature, the least that could be
expected from the administration is
to present the merits of the bend is
sue:" ' '

JEFFS RELEASED,
UPON SUSPICION
Second Arrest Made on Request
Attorney Carden; Dr. Ayer
Examines Wound
Twice in the last 24 hours Harold
Jeffs, the barber, has been arrested
by the police on suspicion of being
responsible for the death of his wife
Thursday-morning. He is now being
held for investigation.
Immediately following the coroner's
jury verdict yesterday that discredit
ed the suicide theory, he was arrested
to be released. later-in the afternoon
In the custody of two friends. This
morning Sheriff Rose again ordered
Iblm behind the bars upon request of
Deputy County Attorney W. Tv Car
den. : ' ' . 7 .'
Police Surgeon R. G. Ayer made a
thorough examination Friday evening
of the bullet's path through the vic
tim's brain and personally does not
believe the shot could have been fired
by herself. r
"It" would be almost a physical im
possibility for her to have held the
rifle in such a position to take a down
ward path from the place of entrance
into the skull instead of the probable
upward course had she shot herself,"
says the physician.
He : also doesnot understand how
the gun could have been resting so
naturally across her breast with the
thumb carefully inserted in the trig
ger guard when the result of such a
shot is a complete coiiapse.
Attorney E. A. Douthltt, who has
been retained by Jeffs, stated this
morning that the two little Jeffs chil
drtn had been taken to the St. An
drew's priory.
Jeff 8, in custody of Detective Ru
dolph Stein, went to his wife's funeral
yesterday afternoon but showed not
signs of breaking down. v '

following the trial of Chlr Hark Sir, a
Korean whom the magistrate had
fined S5 for throwing a soda water
bottle on the street, when he learned!
the defendant had a posted bond of
As in cash.
The whole tudience laughed with
the court when he said he had no idea
the defendant had so much money and
might have assessed a fine mere in
proportion to what he considered a
serious practise.
When the defendant explained
tli rough an interpreter, however, that
he was a hard working man, entirely
ignorant of the law and received an
average wage cf $21 in 26 days, the
judge felt better but he refused to
remit costs of the trial, still holding
the fine as high aa possible in the
light of that whole half hundred dol
lars in cash.

NEW YO R K, Nov. 4. Republican
and Democratic national . campaigns
art coming to a virtual close tonight
with tremendous demonstrations cen
tering around the chief figurts Pres
ident Woodrow Witson and Candidate
Charles E. Hughes.
After a swing around the state, with
half a dozen speeches daily, Hughes
reached New York today and ' re
doubled his activity. The former jus
tice made 'ive speeches this afternoon,
closing with an address in Madison
Square Garden. The huge structure
was packed with people who cheered
the Republican candidate.
In his Madison Square Garde
speech Hughes assailed the Wilson ad
ministration. He declared that ht is
for the maintenance of American
rights throughout the world, and that
he is "opposed to treating the Amer
ican merchant as a suspicious charac
ter. He said that he is "confident of
election" and that if elected he does
not propose to deal with international
situations in an "academic manner."
