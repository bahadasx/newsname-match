MERELY BIG BLUFF TO

tion of Favorite.
I'.y the Sporting llttor.
Pope does not always follow the
lino of betting. The amount avail
able for Vetting, the loyalty of the
Letter, his Udiefs, past affiliations

for the odd? he will give or the odds

the next pilot of the U. S. A. The
tin to six are the Wall Ft. odds, but
they do not extend this far away
lrom the scaroasL
Around these diggings the pre
vailing odds are r.lx. Most of the
lets made in this city ure even
money. Harlier in the campaign a
number of bets were made at ten
to eight. Now one of the biff belters
is offering ten to nine. A o--t of

There have teen several bets dur
ing the last few days at five to four.
These have not lcen numerous and
have been accepted about as soon as
the ofTer was made. It Is admitted
that there is more Hughes money
here than Wilson money, but this
argues nothing.
Money Make Odd-,
The Fame rule which holds good
in many other rases can be applied
here and throughout the country.
The loyal pans that follows its col
1(.?P team to the rival city always
l;nds the odds in its favor. They are
jew, while the others are many.
They have spent their money on
their trip and their betting purse is
limited, if not empty.
Hence it follows that where 10 j
people are anxious to bet on one
side and there are only '20 people
who want 16 bet on the opposite
t-ide, 2") out of the 100 bettrrs must
needs put up the best odds if they
place their money. It's one place
where the minority his it on the
majority.
The two teams may be evenly
matched but when it comes down
to a betting preposition the 2. so
journers in the hotib zone know
they have the whip hand and they
make t;e of it. They force the odds
and set better than even money or.
wh;i; from a purely sportir.fr stand
point shonld be an even-even affair.
Kuh Holds Goenl Hon.
This has been the rule in reirard
t. the political election here in
s-'outh P.end. There is more Hughes
money in South l'end than there is
Wilson money. A glanco at the
contributions to the rival campaign
funds is enough to show this, iSlnce
there is less Wilson money, the.
Huncs bickers must oTcr odds to
place their bets. The Wilson back
ers know they can force the odds

The Wall odds are fakes pure

ever looms up as the result of an
announcement by the department of
commerce today that it has received
a report of a coal substitute which
can be produced cheaply.
S. H. Dennison, American consul
at Christ iania, Norway, reports to
the department that R. V. Strelen
ert, a Norwegian engineer of Goth
enburg, has perfected an artificial
coal substitute which stands all
tests to which it is subjected.
Its manufacture on a large scale
is to be-in soon at Greaker, Norway,
and Norwegian coal imports are ex
pected to be reduced -0 per cent,
the report says.
The artificial coal is made by
treating sulphite lye, a bi-product
incident to the making of sulphite,
heretofore regarded as refuse. The
lye is reduced to a dust. The dust
is compressed into bricks and burn
ed. The artificial coal yields 6,900
heat calories.
The best English coal under the
same tests yields only- 7,00' calories.
The discovery" is declared by of
ficials to have an important bearing
on the future price of coal and on

Around 600,000
r ... .. .
BERLJN, Nov. 3. Estimates of
the Franco-Dritish losses during the
four rronths' offensive on the Somme
front, emanating- from German gen
eral headquarters in the west, give
the losses in round numbers as 600,
0(0. The survey places the Rritish
losses at 4 00.000 and those of the
French at 180.000. The estimates,
the survey says, are regarded as
moderate in view of the fact that
the British casualty lists admit loss
es of 372, 00U to the end of Sep
tember. The writer claims that
each square mile "of territory recov
ered cost the allies more than S.OOQ.
That the original purpose was to
get through, the writer says, is
shown by the prodigious scale of
the preparation and the huge- mass
es of cavalry held in re-tdiness to
begin the pursuit through the
broken German lines. The writer
contends that the claim of the en
tente allies that the plan of the of
fensive was not to break the Ger
man lines but merely to relieve the
pressure elsewhere by holding fast
a large part of the German forces,
is only an after-thought invented to
cover the evident failure of the of
fensive to reach its objective.
