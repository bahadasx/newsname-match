VOL. XXXV.
KINGM ANT ARIZONA, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 4, 1916
PERSONNEL OF
TICKET F
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
The Democratic party, at the recent
primary, selected for its candidates
men who have had long residence in
Mohave county and are noted for their
ability and integrity. It is with no
disparagement of the candidates of the
other parties that the Daily Miner
puts forth the claim that the candi
dates of the Democratic party are
worthy of the support of voters for
the offices to which they aspire, and
may be relied upon, if elected, to carry
out the work of the various offices to
the best interests of the people.
W. P. Mahoney
The man who has been selected to
represent Mohave county in the senate
of the state of Arizona is W. P.
Mahoney, now a representative in the
state legislature. Mr. Mahoney has
not only been an able representative,
but has attracted a great deal of at
tention to the county in a mining way.
He has worked in the mines of this
county many years and has been suc
cessful in his undertakings. He has
been known to the people of the
county many years and has a host of
warm personal friends in all the other
parties who believe in his honesty and
sincerity. His experience in the past
legislature will make him a valuable
asset to Mohave county's legislative
material.
Jasper N. Brewer
The Democrats have put forth Jas
per N. Brewer to carry the legislative
banner to victory in the present cam
paign. Jasper, as he is familiarly
known to his host of friends, was
raised from childhood in Mohave
county. For years he has been en
gaged in mining and mill work. In his
employment in the various camps he
has surrounded himself with more
friends than the ordinary miner is
blessed and today there is not a man
in Mohave county who can count more
real friends than he. Jasper Brewer
has a sunny disposition, clean habits
and unquestioned integrity.
Joseph W. Prisk
One of the most important offices
to he filled by the electorate of Mo
have county is that of sheriff, and for
that office Joseph W. Prisk of Chlor
ide has been chosen. Joe Prisk came
to Mohave county with his parents
when a small lad. His father was the
late Joe Prisk, one of the early own
ers of the American Flag mine, sit
uated fifteen miles east of Kingman.
Mr. Prisk has resided in the county
about thirty years, having engaged in
mining and other pursuits since boy
hood. He has been the sole support
of his mother since the death of his
father many years ago. In the town
in which he lives his friends are evi
denced by the almost solid vote of
the townspeople it the primaries in
his favor. He is a splendid fellow
and the workers of the county are
sure to be with him on election day.
I. N. Hart
After two years as clerk of' the
board of supervisors, I. N. Hart was
selected as the Democratic candidate
for county treasurer. He is capable,
honest and 'efficient. Since coming to
Mohave county many years ago he
was engaged in mining until the fail
ing sight of his wife required him to
remove to town, where she might be
under better care. As a miner he was
liked by all the boys and numbers
his friends by the hundreds. No mat
ter what place in life Newt Hart fills
his love for the mining game will
ever be alive.
Harry L. Underwood
So popular was Harry Underwood
that no Democrat had the temerity to
jnake a stand against him in the re
PREPARING QUARTERS FOR
DISPENSING OF JUSTICE
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
In anticipation of his appointment
as justice of the peace for the Oatman
precinct, succeeding Dr. J. M. Fran
cis, resigned, Zadock Sheffield has en
gaged offices and a courtroom in the
Oatman Drug building. He is busily
engaged in fitting up the quarters.
It is likely that he will be the
busiest man in Oatman for the first
few weeks after taking office. It is
said much work has piled up during
the past two months. Many civil mat
ters will demand the attention of the
new justice when he is ready for busi
ness, which, it is expected, will be the
later part of the week.
DEKif
1 H
cent primaries for the office of Recor
der, and even the Republicans could
not dig up a man to oppose him until
the woods were combed over the past
few weeks. Harry has been assistant
in many of the offices and has also
been employed in several of the large
mercantile establishments as book
keeper and salesman. In every cap
acity he was popular and it is not
strange that he was unopposed for
the nomination. That he will be elec
ted is a foregone conclusion and that
he will make an able officer for the
county goes without saying.
S. D. Stewart
There is one man on the Democratic
ticket that really cannot enjoy the
campaign, because he goes into the
fray unopposed. But the fact that
he is not opposed by the common
enemy speaks well for Mr. Stewart's
standing with the people, and his
election as county attorney will mean
that the office will be filled by a man
who will care for the people's in
terests. He is a graduate of the
University of California and has en
joyed a lucrative law practice in both
Yavapai and Mohave county. He
brings to the office ability and legal
training and an appreciation of the
responsibility of the office.
Frank L. Hunt
Another man who was unopposed in
the primaries is Frank L. Hunt, who
is making the race for county assessor
for the third time. Mr. Hunt has de
veloped such talent as assessor that
it would be a distinct loss to the
people to replace him with another.
Ability, integrity and faithful work
have created in Mf. Hunt such a
valuable servant of the people that
the voters will see no other name but
his when they go into the booth to
mark their ballots on election day.
Mrs. R. A. Lassell
Chosen without opposition for coun
ty superintendent of schools, Mrs. R.
A. Lassell is slated to succeed herself
in that office. During the past two
years she has filled the office well and
faithfully, and during the next two
years she will continue the good work.
L. H. Foster
L. H. Foster, one of the best known
surveyors in the county, has been
named as one of the Democratic
supervisorial candidates. Mr. Foster
first came to this county about a dozen
years ago as the locating engineer of
a large land project on the Colorado
river. So highly did the country im
press him that he concluded to remain
and has been a prominent citizen of
the county ever since. He is capable,
. energetic and honest, as well as being
i in favor of the extension of our good
J roads system to every part of the
! county.
J Charles W. Lynch
I The running mate of Mr. Foster in
! this campaign is Charles W. Lynch of
Kingman. Mr. Lynch has been a resi
dent of this county the better part
of thirty years, having come here with
his brother to operate a sampling
works. He is one of the owners of the
C. O. D. mine, which property he has
, operated off and on for many years.
, He is one of the best known men in
rthe county and his ability and in-
tegrity will be factors in his manage
j ment of county affairs. As a member
i of the new county board of super
j visors he will be found advocating
I progressive measures in its affairs,
'which will include the steady build
J ing of roads and the boosting of every
resource. He and Mr. Foster will
j fittingly fill the gap in the board that
will be made by the lapsing of the
terms of office of O. E. Walker and
I. M. George. x
LIKES LOOKS OF
i
(From Oatrcan Section Dally Miner)
E. M. Rogers and Ed Lowe have
returned from an inspection visit to
the tatter's property in the Weaver
district. Mr. Rogers states that the
showing in that section is wonderful.
One great difficulty, he states, is the
scarcity of water. There are but few
places where water may be procured,
and these are hard to find.
The Lowe property was sampled and
assays are being made. It is expected
that some high values will be shown.
Should they prove satisfactory Mr.
Rogers and friends will take it over
for development
EXHIBITS FOR STATE
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
The last of the mining exhibits from
this district were shipped yesterday
to the state fair commission at Phoe
nix. County Mineral Commissioner
MacDuffee was here early in the week
assisting Secretary W. K. Smith of the
chamber of commerce in rounding up
the last of the specimens. They were
gathered from every mine in the dis
trict which has encountered ore of any
value.
One of the best specimens ever
taken out of the county was that con
tributed by the United Eastern. It
weighs 1000 pounds and was picked
from a part of the mine where the
vein and formation can be shown to
best advantage. Free gold in abund
ance can be plainly seen in the speci
men. It was taken out in a square
block and trimmed up, and it is safe
to say that it will be one of the hand
somest specimens at the fair.
PIS
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
The installation of pumping facili
ties at the Ivanhoe is almost com
pleted. In the next few days the work
of unwatering the shaft will begin.
It will be a task of magnitude as the
shaft is 500 feet deep and is said
to be filled with water to the 300 foot
point. The management is anxious to
get the work underway as soon as
possible.
The last round of shots fired before
the closing down of the property is
said to have uncovered the long sought
vein. It also opened a large flow of
water, so large, in fact, that it was ;
impossible to handle. A few grab !
samples v.-on taken from the breast
of the drift and they are said to
show free gold.
When the shaft and workings are
again free of water drifting will be
gin and it is expected that a good
body of ore mil be disclosed in a
short time. The property is well
financed and all preliminary work has
been done.
IS
L
( (From Friday's Dally Miner.)
During the past year Kingman has
experienced a good sized building
boom but nothing in comparison to the
one mapped out ror the next six
months. The amount of money that
will be expended in building will ap
proximate $300,000, as follows:
Beale hotel $ 50,000
County high school 65,000
M. E. church 15,000
Lovin & Withers Co. store. . . 75,000
Arizona Engineering Co. store 20,000
Raymond H. Carr residence. . 10,000
Three' other homes. $15,000 to 20,000
25 small residences 18,750
Warehouses 10,000
Total $278,750
Besides these contemplated build
ings, a building company is figuring
on the erection of at least 30 five to
six-room residences in an addition to
the town. As the activity increases it
is more than probable that many other
buildings not now contemplated will
be erected. The expenditure of the
amount of money named above will
certainly keen a laree number of men
employed through the winter.
INSTALLS HOT WATER
SYSTEM IN BEALE HOTEL
(From Thursday's Daily Miner.)
A. Ericson has completed the in
stallation of a hot water system and
a steam heating plant in the Beale
hotel. The entire system is one of
the best in the state. By the pres
sure hot water is driven to every room
in the building and with the steam
boiler a uniform temperature is main
tained. The work was done under the
supervision of A. Dayton, who has had
considerable experience in his line,
having been in charge of the plumb
ing of the Alexander hotel in Los Angeles.

BALANCES STOLEN
FROM ASSAY OFFICE
From Oatman Section Daily Miner.l
Thieves entered the assay office of
the Goldroad Mining company last
Saturday night and carried away
three balances and other valuable
equipment. Entrance was affected by
forcing a window after cutting the
screen away. The loss is estimated at
$700.
One set of the balances taken was
worth $300, but if roughly handled
by the thieves it would practically be
useless. No clue was left by the
thieves and so far the officers have
been unable to obtain one. However,
watch is being kept where the articles
might be offered for sale.
L. M. Teale is recovering from a
slight attack of ptomaine poisoning.
He was laid up for several days but
is now able to attend to his duties as
clerk of the Superior court.
WILL INSPECT NEW
FIND IN NELLIE
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner),
Sam Bayles, member of the recently
appointed committee of direction of
the Oatman Chamber of Mines and
Boosters' Club, stated yesterday that
the committee has applied to the
management of the Nellie f Mining
company for permission to visit and
examine the new strike at that prop
erty. When the committee has been
granted the necessary permission, the
members will inspect the strike, sam
ple it and have assays made by two
assayers. The returns mil be made
public Such is the course the com
mittee will pursue after strikes are
reported in the future. It is the in
tention to give the outside world
authentic intormatioii on all Oatman
mines. Should a "wildcat" show up
it will be advertised as such.
It is the intention of the committee
to advertise the camp as much as
possible along conservative and truth
ful lines in the future campaign of
publicity which has been outlined. In
a short time the public will learn that
authentic information may be obtained
from the committee. The committee
is ready at all times to answer any
inquiries received.
FACTS FOR VOTERS
TO
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
Phoenix Ariz., Oct 25, 1916.
To the Voters of Arizona:
The Democratic state committee
wishes to call the attention of the
voters of the state to two facts they
should boar in mind when entering
the voting booth on November 7.
First The name of Henry D. Ross,
Democratic nominee for member of
the supreme court does not appear on
the ballot under the party name, but
is placed in a non-partisan list at the
top of the ticket This applies also to
the candidate for superior judge in
each county.
Second The law provides that the
name of candidates for state tax com
missioner shall also be placed on the
ballot without party designation,
therefore the name of Charles R.
Howe, Democratic candidate for that
office, appears on the top of the bal
lot as does the name of Judge Ross.
We realize that there are thousands
of voters in the state who will vote the
(straight) Democratic ticket, who will
be greatly disappointed if they learn
that they overlooked Judge Ross and
Mr. Howe. For this reason we take
this method of calling their attention
to the matter. Respectfully yours,
GEORGE J. STONEMAN,
Chairman Democratic State Commit
tee. VEIN EXPOSED IN
UNITED NORTRERN
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
A report was received in Kingman
from Oatman last evening to the effect
that the round of shots set off yes
terday afternoon in the United North
ern brought to light its long sought
vein, and with it some very good look
ing ore.
No assays had been made last
night and, in consequence, no values
could be announced.
PIONEER PASSES AWAY
AT COPPER GIANT MINE
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
William DeWitt, father of Mrs. Wil
liam Neagle, died at her home at the
Copper Giant mine late Tuesday
night Death was due to a stroke of
apoplexy. Mr. DeWitt was about 70
years old and was a pioneer of Yava
pai county. His body was prepared
for shipment to the old home in Pres
cott yesterday by Undertaker Van
Marter.
BUYS EQUIPMENT
(From Oatman Stctlon Dally Miner)
The Arizona Engineering company
yesterday announced the sale to the
Wrigley Sulphides company of a com
plete minin gequipmcnt from a hoist
to a compressor, drills, etc. The sale
involved several thousand dollars.
AT
LAZY BOY PROPERTY
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
The Lazy Boy, one of the most
promising properties in the southern
part of the district, is the latest prop
erty in camp to resume operations.
A contract has been let to Harbeck
and Checke for 200 feet of drift work
on the 200 foot level. They have
secured a crew of miners and have
commenced work. The drifting is
being done in a westerly direction
from the shaft It is expected that
the vein will be cut before the con
tract is completed.
Manager J. L. Mclver says that for
the present no other work is planned
but that before the 200 feet of drift
ing is completed it is likely that an
extensive campaign of development
will have been decided upon.
The Lazy Boy was closed three
months ago owing to the inability of
the pumping equipment to handle the
large flow of water in the shaft below
the 200 foot level. One large "sinker"
pounded itself to pieces and others
that were installed were of too small
capacity to handle the flow, which is
said to be the largest so far en
countered in the district The tap
ping of the vein at the Wrigley will
partly, if not wholly, drain the Lazy
Boy. Should this occur it is thought
that sinking will be resumed soon
afterward.
PROMOTERS OF GOLF
OLUR ROLD IE1G
From Thursdays Dairy Miner
Definite steps toward the organiza
tion of a golf club were taken last
night at a meeting of local enthusi
asts of the game in the jury room at
the courthouse. Among those present
were H. H. Watkins, Dr. White, Bur
nell Osier, J. S. Amundsen, Mr. Ide,
R. W. Wilde, D. W. Stewart, E. J.
Hoover, Dr. Cowie, Carl G. Krook, C.
N. Leonard, Charles Granger, C. A.
Patterson, E. A. Cooke, C. N. Nickell,
Rev. Thomas Dodd and H. L. Baldwin.
Several persons sent their regrets.
H. L. Baldwin was elected as per
manent chairman and E. A. Cooke
secretary. Discussion was had as to
die name of the club, plans for main
tenance of grounds, membership fees,
monthly dues and other details which
will be acted upon later.
Messrs. Krook, Wilde, Amundsen,
Hoover and Nickell were appointed a
committee to draft a set of by-laws
for the club.
Messrs. Leonard, Granger and
C.ioke were appointed a committee on
membership.
Adjournment was taken until Thurs
day evening, November 9, at 7:30
o'clock, when the by-laws will be
adopted and officers elected. The club
will start with a membership of 40
or more and bids fair to become one
of the liveliest social organizations in
northern Arizona.
FIRE DEPARTMENT
SAVES RESIDENCE
From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
The prompt response of the fire de
partment saved the residence of Joe
Sheffield from destruction Tuesday
morning. When the firemen arrived
one room of the building was en
veloped in flames but the chemical
engine was brought into play and the
blaze quickly extinguished with but
small damage.
The fire was caused by the use of
gasoline in cleaning clothing by Mrs.
Lucy Baldwin, 'mother-in-law of Mr.
Sheffield. She was badly burned on
the arms, and it was necessary to call
a physician to attend her. The dam
age was small and covered by in
surance. KxVYSER IMPROVING
From Thursday's Daily Miner
Frank Kayser, who is confined in a
hospital in Los Angeles, is improving
steadily, according to reports received
here. Considerable trouble was ex
perienced by the surgeons in tying
the broken bones of his ankle together,
but this has been accomplished and
it is likely that the mending will be
rapid in the future.
