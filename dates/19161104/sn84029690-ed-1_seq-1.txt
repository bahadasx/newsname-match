explain the how and whereof of the
light proposition that will be voted up
on November 20th. The voters- want
to know why the Light plant are ask
ing $29,000 for their plant, when at the
last election the city turned down 25,
000 for the same plant? Thi3 question

TWO. STATE INSTITUTIONS
NEED MILLER'S ELECTION
Candidate for State Senate Could
Better Look After Interests
of 39th District, Fol
lowers Believe.
As the election approaches, interest
in the candidacy of C. W. Miller of
Hays, for, state senator from the Thirty-ninth
senatorial district on the Re
publican ticket, is not confined in Ellis
county to the Republicans alone, but
many Democrats of the county and of
Hays are pointing out that this district
needs a senator who will be in harmony
with the state legislature and the state
administration.
Republicans all over Kansas are
watching what' Hays and Ellis county
intend to do in regard to the election of
a state senator. These Republicans
over the state point out that it is of
vital importance to r,ms county ana
Hays to have a Republican senator be
cause of the two state institutions in
the county. A Republcan state sena
tor will be more in harmony and can
get more done in their behalf than a
Democratic senator could. Interest in
the Ellis county vote foe senator is
state-wide and the result will be
watched carefully all over the state.
A vote for C. W. Miller means the
-
bolstering up of the Ellis count- state
institutions. It is a known fact that
Mr. Miller stands closer to the state
administration than most other Repub
licans in the district, besides if the
citizens of Hays 6T Ellis county should
want anything in reason from the pow
ers at the state capital Senator Miller
and Representative Chittenden could
be in Topeka in a very few hours, while
Malone, who lives in western part of
the state would have to be communi
cated withwhich would mean at least
a delay of from four to five days, and
delays are some times dangerous.
The election of C. W.- Miller will mean
prompt and efficient service.
