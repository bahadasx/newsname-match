personal comment to make on the
acjlon of the head of the War De

said Mr. Ames. "The lesolutloa was

The resolution follows:
"Whereas, It Is reported In The
New York Tribune this moruliiK that
Secretary of War Maker, at a public
meeting held In Jersey City last night,
used the following laiignnge reflecting
upon the character of the members of
Washington's army at Valley Forge,

'"I know that the Mexicans do not
respect American life and property,'
said Mr. Ilakcr. 'I know that they
do not pay their debts, that they aro
ragamulllns, that they desecrate
Church property, that their money Is
no good and that they are generally
worthless. Hut people never respect
those things In icxoliitloiis. We did
not respect them In our Civil War.
Washington's soldlei.s In the match
to Valley Forgo stole everything they
could lay their hands on; took tho
silver vessels out of the clmrclioa and
sold them to buy drink. They drove
ministers out of the churches. Their
money was worthless and they were
Just as bad characters as the Mexi
cans. "Itesolved, That we, tho descend
ants of the patt'iots of the Revolu

of War, and direct that a copy of
this preamble and resolution be sent
to him."
Similar action will be taken by pa

Sneers at Real Patriots Because Ho
asks In an Environment That
Glories In Yielding Every American
Right Also Takes a Fling at Civil
1 War Heroes, Saying They Commit
ted the Same Crimes of Which
Mexican Outlaws Are Now Guilty.
The defense which Secretary of
War Newton D. Baker ofTercd for Mr.
Wilson's Mexican policies found quick
response from patriotic Americans
but, hardly tho respoaso Mr. Uaker
could have wished for.
Iu a speech In Jersey City, the Sec
retary likened the Mexican revolution
ists to the Continentals who fought
with WnslilnKtou. He admitted the
Mexicans were a rascally lot, but said
their actions were those of nil rebels.
The patriots of the American Hernia
tion looted churches and drove minis
ters from them on their famous march
to Valley Forge, he added.
Protest have come from for and
near. The Empire State Society of
the Sous of the American Revolution
met and adopted n resolution con
demning "In the strongest ternu the
unpatriotic language of the Secretary

I .simply desire to sere the American
people."
