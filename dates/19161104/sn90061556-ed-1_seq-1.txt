For Republican Candidates.
"A bold attempt to disfranchise Ne
gro voters in the North as well as In
the South Is the latest scheme of the
"Wilson campaign managers. It is a
plain game gOjntimldatlon, and it
shows the lengths to which the Demo
cratic managers are willing to go in
this campaign. The confidence they
have displayed in planning and execut
ing sonie of their schemes without
interference from Democratic district
attorneys Is paralleled only by the
confidence with which city crooks go
about their business under the sure
protection of corrupt police.
The above statement was issued by
William It. Wilcox, chairman of the
Republican National Committee. The
statement continues as follows:
NEGROES UNANIMOUS AGAINST
WILSON.
"The- Negro voters of the United
States are practically unanimous in
their opposition to President Wilson.
The Democratic campaign managers
legations of activity by the Depart
ment of Justice and the appointment
of special attorneys general to Inves
tigate and prosecute colonizers.
"The Democrats know that there
are no such colonies. They know
that the movement of Negroes from
Some of the southern states, on which
they relied to give some color of cred
ltabillty to their reckless charge, was
a genuine effort to secure more labor
for Northern concerns. They know
that It was fostered and encouraged
by the Democratic Bureau of Employ
ment in the Department of Labor, be
fore the Democratic managers saw a
political opportunity in it.
DEMOCRATS CIRCULATE FALSE
HOOD. "But relying upon the probability
that tho general public would be ig
norant of the fact, the unscrupulous
Democratic managers spread their
calculated falsehood. It was Import
ant to them to get this charge of

Republican Nominee for U. S. Senator.
voting, or at least to make It so dif
ficult for them that many thousands
will loso their votes.
"But tho scheme won't work. The
Republican managers will take steps
to meet It wherever the Democrats at
tempt to put It into execution.
NEGRO REPUBLICAN LEADERS
EXPECT TO CARRY STATE FOR
HUGHES, LAMM AND DICKEY.
STATE CHAIRMAN C. G. WILLIAMS
SEES VICTORY IN MISSOURI.
"Charles O. Williams, of Boonvllle,
Mo., chairman of the Auxiliary Re
publican State Committee, does not
fear Democratic intimidation of Ne
gro voters In Missouri. When seen
at tho headquarters of tho committee,
In tho International Life Building, in
St. Louis, although overwhelmed by
the activities of the strenuous cam
paign, lie took time to express his
opinion on tho political situation in
Missouri,' formed from tho reports re
ceived from an army of trained work
ers, scattered over nil parts of the
state.
Mr. Williams said In. part: "Re
ports from nil over Missouri indi
cate that the present campaign has
been tho most stubborn political bat
tle in the history of tho state. But
we have had tho aid and co-operation
of the ablest and most experienced
Negro orators and political workers
in the state, who have worked con
scientiously and efficiently for the Re
publican cause, and the results have
been highly satisfactory.
"The Negro voters have been
reached and thoroughly aroused and
organized and several thousand more
Negro voters will be brought to the
polls to cast their ballots for the can
didates of the Republican party than
have ever before voted at an election
in Missouri.
"Our campaign speakers nnd orga
nizers have been greeted everywhere
with greater and more enthusiastic
crowds than in any former campaign.
Every nook and corner of the state
has been reached and tho Negro
voters everywhere are eager to cast
vote to register a protest against
the actions of the Wilson administra
tion, and while I do not predict a
landslide, I feel perfectly safe In fore
casting Uie election of the entire Re
publican ticket in Missouri."
DABNEY PREDICTS ELECTION OF
HUGHES, LAMM AND DICKEY.
Fred W. Dabney, head of the or
ganization department of the Auxil
iary State Republican. Committee
said: "I look for a larger and more
enthusiastic support of the Republi
can candidates by the Negro voters
in Missouri next Tuesday, because of
the attitude of the national adminis
tration and the open hostility of Sen
ator Reed, of Missouri, who allied
himself with such Negro-haters as
Senators Tillman and Vardaman, in
opposing tho rights of the Negro race
in the 63rd Congress.
Tho little handful of Negroes, who
for selfish reasons, are advocating a
division of the Negro vote, are not
meeting with any success at the
hands of .the rank and file of our peo
ple. There is no questionof political
expediency In a division of our vote
as long as the Democratic party of the
nation Is dominated by the Democrats
of the South.
The events of the last four years
have served to convince the Negroes
of this and as a result, not only in
the state of Missouri, but throughout
tho nation, Negroes who gave their
vote for. Wilson four years ago, are
now working like Trojans for tho elec
tion of Hughes, and I believe I am
justified in predicting that Missouri
will send Walter S. Dickey to the
United States Senate and will elect
Judge Henry Lamm to the governor
ship of Missouri by the largest ma
jority ever given any candidate on a
state ticket In recent years."
are well aware of that, fact The
course of injustice and segregation to
which the Negroes have been subject
ed ever since the Wilson administra
tion came into power has been such
as to alienate every colored voter that
- ever was friendly to Wilson.
"Knowing that this vote is wholly
against them, the Democratic man
agers have set out deliberately to pre
vent it from being cast or counted.
This Is the real explanation of the
sensational charges of Negro coloni
zation that the Democratic managers
have been so Industriously scattering
around the country for the last two
or three weeks.
"This is the secret behind the al-
colonization floated In order to lay a
foundation for the. execution of their
plan to keep Negroes away from the
polls on election day. . The Demo
crats have long been expert in the
disfranchisement of Negroes In the
South. But they also know that the
North Is not a shotgun country. They
knew they must devise some method
that does not rely upon the shotgun
tactics for execution.
PLAN TO CHALLENGE NEGRO
VOTERS.
"They plan to challenge every Ne-
gro voter who goes to the poljs and
offers to vote. It Is by this species
of Intimidation ' that they plan to
frighten a good many Negroes out of

"Lest we forget,. remember yet":
The Republican partyis the ship of
state. The Democratic party is the
sea. Democrats would destroy your
rights. Republicans made you free.
"Lest wo forget, remember yet":
Tho Republican party1 gave you the
ballot, and has helped you to Improve
your condition for fifty years. The
Democratic party has, disfranchised
you in eleven states, and for fifty
years has Jim-Crowed you, lynched
you and burned you at the stake.
"Lest wo forget, remember yyet":
There are no "Jim Crow" laws on
the statute books of Jwy Republican
state. All of the "Jim Cow" states
are Democratic states.
"Lest we forget, remember yet":
The South is in the saddle at Wash
ington, to undo' thS Wjork accomplish
ed by the Civil War, lihd if you aid in
putting them back, you will bo untrue
to yourself and betray your friends,
from whom you can expect nothing In
the future. j
"Lest we forget, remember yet":
President Wilson started the segrega
gation movement againVt the Negroes,
which Is now sweeping over this coun
try. Ho started it in (Washington as
soon as ho was inaugurated four years
ago. Vote for Hughe j.
"Lest we forget, remember yet":
Senator Jim Reed voted to repeal the
Fifteenth Amendment ft the Constitu
tion of the United States, which gives
ou tho right to vote. Vote for
Dickey.
Lest we forget, remember yet":
President Wilson fooled thousands of
people Into voting fnrisilm four years
ago, by false promises, but he can't
fool anybody this time. He has de
celved everybody and pleased nobody,
by his hypocritical pretenses.
Lest we forget, remember yet":
Senator Jim Reed is the arch enemy
of the Negro race in the United States
Senate, and ought to be defeated, by
electing Walter S. Dickey to fill his
place. Mr. Dickey will be a credit to
the state of Missouri in the United
States Senate and will not assault the
rights of any group of citizens of the
state, but will represent every citizen
of Missouri, honorably and creditably.
Lest we forget, remember yet"
The Negro vote is tho balance of
power in Missouri, and every Negro
should rally to the Republican ticket
this year and aid in returning the Re-
publican party to power in tho state
and in tho nation.
Lest we forget, remember yet":
Vote for Hughes, Lamm and Dickey,
and defeat the Democrats, who have
given the country the worst four years
of mis-rule the country has ever wit
nessed.
'Lest we forget, remember yet":
The Negroes of the country should
rise as one, man to cast their votes
in protest against the abuse of power
that placed the government into the
hand3 of those who sought fifty years
ago to assassinate it and continue the
damnable institution of slavery.
Lest we forget, remember yet":
Go boldly to the polls next Tuesday,
and cast your ballot and insist on
having it counted and fear no man
who tries to intimidate you In the
exercise of your manhood rights.
'Lest we forget, remember yet :
The Democratic party seeks to dls-

from the very Genesis of the Great

the Republican Party has been en
trusted by a Divine Providence with,
the lives, liberties, immunities, priv
ileges, properties, prosperity and hap
piness of the people of this Nation:
all of the people of this Nation. And
although the Party has at times for
gotten some parts of the Law as it
pertains to all of the people, it still
is the custodian of the people's rights,
liberties, etc., and is now like re
pentant Israel coming back to the
landmarks of progress, prpsperlty, lib

constitutional rights of all of the cit
