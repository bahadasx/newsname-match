With just one working day before
the state and nation-wide elections,
political conditions in all of the 105
counties of the state seem to indicate
majority of 30,000 for Charles E.
Hushes for president. This estimate
is based on trips into 84 of the 105
counties and conservative estimates
from observers in the remaining 21
counties. In making the estimate,
consideration is given existing local
conditions as well as party alignments
of two years ago.
An almost general apathy in the
early stages of the campaign made
conditions difficult to forecast. In the
last two or three weeks. Kansas voters
have taken a new interest in national
politics. Thruout the campaign Kan
sas has viewed the situation dispas
sionately. There has been less noise
and less expression of opinion than in
any presidential fight in the state in
years. A general settling down proc
ess in the last two weeks has seemed
to indicate a trend to Hughes. This
condition has, in the judgment of ob

Cast Their Ballots.
Unusual Interest in Presiden
tial Contest Will Do It.
FIGHT FOR CONGRESS IN STATE
Six Democratic Districts Will
Carry Heaviest Vote.
Double Election Board Will In
sure Early Returns.
Kansas may poll 650,000 votes for
president next Tuesday. That is the
estimate of political observes based on
a vote of 528,203 for governor in 1914
an off year. Regardless of the prob
able record vote, returns will come to
Topeka earlier than usual. Counting
of ballots this year will be facflitated
thru adoption of the double election
board system in all towns and cities.
A total of 634 towns and precincts will
use double election boards. State re
turns will come from 2,474 precincts
in the 105 counties.
Unusual interest in the presidential
fight will bring a heavy vote to the
j polls next Tuesday, political leaders
uenevc. ms increase will oe largely
among the women, laborers and farm
ers. In scores of towns, the registra
tion for the presidential election has
exceeded all former records. The in
crease is especially notable in labor
centers, while hundreds of women
who did not go to the polls in 1914
the first woman's vote in a Kansas
state-wide election have this year
registered for a vote on the pres
idency. The Fight In Kansas.
The only fight in Kansas this year
oncerns the state presidential electoral
vote and the election of congressmen
in the six districts now represented by
Democrats. These six districts the
Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh
and Eighth have been the battle
ground in the campaign which ends
next Monday night. Of course, there
has been fighting in the First and
Second districts. But the fight in those
districts has been for votes for pres

50,000 to 7o,000 more votes than in the
election of two years ago.
The vote among the men will also
be heavier than in 1914. To bring the
total vote of next Tuesday to 650,000
or even above the 600,000 mark, an
increase of 25,000 to 50,000 in th3
male vote is necessary.
Karly Returns Expected.
Returns will oegin coming to To
peka early Tuesday evening. While
the bulletin boards in front of the
State Journal building are telling
stories of the election down east, Kan
sas will for the first tin.e in history
begin giving a little early dope of her
own. This information will come thru
the first count of votes in the towns
where the double election boards
work.
The counting board will go to work
four hours after the polls open. It
will count the votes for national and
state officers. Representatives of po
litical parties may watch the count,
but will be sworn to secrecy concern
ing the announcement of progress of
the count. Following the closing of
the polls, announcement may then be
made of votes counted. Both boards
will proceed with the. national and
state ticket count following the closing
of the election booths. County and
district ballots will be counted last.
With an amalgamation this year of
the Progressive and Republican voters
there is an onnortunitv for much snec-
ooojuiation as to the following of party
" lines, in casting ballots for presiden
tial candidates as well as district and
state candidates. Two years ago when
Kansas polled 528,203 votes. 209,543
votes were cast for Arthur Capper,
Republican, for governor. Other votes
in the gubernatorial contest were:

In the cities, polls will open Tues
day morning at 6 o'clock and will close
at 7 o'clock in the evening. In the
small towns and rural precincts, vot
ing will begin at 7 o'clock In the morn
ing, with a 6 o'clock closing hour.
Election boards will work in 2,474
precincts during the day and night.
Wyandotte will vote in 108 precincts,
i the record for the state. Shawnee
county is second with 62 precincts and
Sedgwick county third with 69 pre

Shawnee county Republicans are
claiming every county office for next
Tuesday's election. They are claim
ing the county for Hughes by a major
ity of from 3,000 up.
Shawnee county Democrats admit
the probable election of Republicans to
most county offices but they claim four
and are claiming the county for Wil
son. The Democrats say they expect to
elect a sheriff, a county clerk, one
member of the legislature and a coun
ty commissioner. Everything else they
concede to the Republicans. The Re
publicans concede nothing.
Frank Whitney, chairman of the
Democrat county committee, declared
today there was no question about the
election of William Schlichter, the
Democrat candidate for sheriff against
Hugh Larimer. He appeared to have
more confidence regarding that one
office than any other.
Hugh Larimer was nominated by
the Republicans after a hard fight. His
lead over the next candidate was small.
The other candidates announced after
the election that they would support
him and Larimer began his campaign.
Then James Baker was killed during
a raid upon an alleged joint and a
charge of murder was brought against
Larimer. It was charged by Lari
mer's friends that the case was
brought for political purposes. The
case was tried and it developed Into
more or less of a farce. Larimer was
exonerated by judge and jury and he
continued his campaign. He is confi
dent of his election and Republican
managers express confidence in it. But

MAY VOTE AWAY
Attorney General Says Citizen
Doesn't Need To Be at Home.
(
But Person Must Be Duly Reg
istered and Qualified.
An important ruling concerning vot
ers who are absent from their home
precincts on election was made today
by S. M. Brewster, attorney general,
in an opinion sent to J. T. Botkin, sec
retary of state. The ruling settles is
sues in the absent voter law. It pro
vides that a person necessarily absent
from home may vote under the sam
conditions which would govern his
vote at home. Registration, the opin
ion holds, is not necessary in the case
of soldiers in service.
Traveling men and -other persons
living in towns where registration is
required, may vote in other towns and
counties in the state other than those
in which they live. But their vote
shall be counted only in case such vot
er was qualified to vote in his or her
home precinct. When the absent votes
are counted, it is the duty of the coun
ty clerk to ascertain whether such
person was duly registered and quali
fied. If not, the vote shall not be
counted. In he case of the soldier
vote, Brewster holds that men in the
service of their country who were un
able to register, may have their vote
counted without regard to the regis
tration laws.
DAVID AND GOLIATH
Topeka High School Lightweights to
Trounce St. Joe Giants.
The Biblical drama of "David and
Goliath" was to be re-enacted this aft
ernoon at 2:30 o'clock at Western
League park when the light high
school eleven faced the heavy St. Joe
high school, eleven, averaging 179
pounds per man, a handicap of thirty
pounds of beef over the Topeka eleven.
But Coach Bearg hoped that the
Goliaths would go down before the
speed and strategy of the home team.
High school fans are cheered by the
addition this week of Darrow, a new
180-pound lineman from Harshbarg
er's home town. It is hoped that he
will figure largely in the game this
afternoon.
St. Joe defeated Atchison but by a
slightly larger margin than the high
school did a week ago. High school
players insist that the team has speed
ed up greatly since then and predict
nothing but victory this afternoon. The
only fly in the ointment is the ab
sence of Preston, a star halfback from
the lineup. t

SHIPS CRASH IN
GALE AND SINK;
100 LIVES LOST
Only One Survivor Lives to Tell
of Sea Tragedy.
Sea So Rough It Was Impos
sible to Launch Boats.
ONE CARRIED PASSENGERS
Collision in Irish Channel in
Dead of Night.
51 of Lost Were Passengers
Aboard the Ferry Connemara.
London, Nov. 4. In one of the
worst gales ever known In the Irish
sea, the British steamship Connemara,
with passengers and a cargo of cattle
from Greenore, Ireland, for Holyhead,
Wales, collided last night, just out
side the Carlingford bar, with the Brit
ish steamship Retriever, laden with
coal. Both vessels sank immediotely,
with an estimated loss of life " about
100. Of the fifty passengers and crew
of thirty-one aboard the Connemara,
there is only one survivor. It is vir
tually certain there were no Americans
on board. The entire crew of the Re
triever was lost. Many bodies are be
ing washed ashore on the Irish coast.
Numbers of cattle also are being wash
ed up, some alive.
The weather was so rough that it
would have been impossible to launch
any boats, even had time permitted.
The lone survivor, a named named
Boyle, miraculously escaped death. He
brought back the story of the sea dis
aster and prevented the disappearance
of two ships with their passengers and
crews from becoming an untold sea's
mystery.
Bound for Holyhead, Wales.
Only fragmentary reports of the dis
aster had reached London this after
noon. From these accounts it appears
that the Connemara, a ferry of the
London & Northwestern railway line,
left Greenore, Ireland, at about dusk
yesterday evening for Holyhead,
Wales, and collided with the inward
bound steamer Retriever, a few miles
off the Irish coast.-
The Connemara was carrying 51
passengers. So far as is known here
none of them was an American.
Leaving Greenore the ferry steamer
ran into the teeth of a terrific hur
ricane, plunging along thru the dark
ness and storm, with even greater dif
ficulty, the smaller Retriever, in
bound for her home port of Newry, in
Carlingford Lough, crashed into the
Connemara. Whether the Retriever
carried passengers is not known. Ap
parently few of the Connemara's pas
sengers had retired when the collision
occurred.
Bodies Washed Ashore.
Crews of both steamers apparently
tried to launch the boats. Seaport
towns near the scene of the disaster
reported the sea tossed so violently
last night that it was doubtful if a
single boat was gotten over by either
steamer. It appears certain that any
boat put over either was crushed
against the steamer's side or capsized
and sucked down in the boiling waters.
The first bodies were washed up
along the County Down coast, just
north of Carlingford Lough. At the
offices of the London & Northwest
ern it is feared that, excepting Boyle,
every man aboard both vessels per

EACH SIDE IS
DETERMINED TO
DICTATE PEACE
Belligerents Want Peace, but
Know It's Impossible.
Britain and Germany Underes
timate Each Other's Strength.
NO PEACE FOR FIVE YEARS
Lord Northcliffe Urges Prepara?
tion on That Basis.
Berlin's Glow of Victory Suc
cumbs to Grim Determination.
BY ROY W. HOWARD
(President of the United Press.)
New York, Nov. 4. Nowhere, either
In England, France or Germany is
there the slightest evidence yet of an
approaching end of the war. In no
country is there any indication that
the struggle can be terminated within
the next two years. There are innum
erable indications that the end is
much farther off. Lord Northcliffe,
who more often probably than any
other man has correctly forecast the
war's developments, is now urging the
British to make no calculations based
upon peace within five years.
Altho pushing their offensive on the
Somme with great vigor, the British
land forces will not have attained full
fighting strength before next summer.
The idea current in Germany that
France is too nearly exhausted for
further dangerous offensive is unwar
ranted optimism. The actual figures
of the Somme drive where the
French, (tho only called on to protect
the right wing of the British offensive
force) have actually taken more
ground and more prisoners than the
British, is indicative of what the
French have in reserve. So also tho
new thrust at Verdun.
On the other hand, the idea current
in the allied countries that Germany
sees either defeat or exhaustion as a
near menace is quite without justifica
tion. Wants Peace Badly, but
. Germany wants peace admittedly
wants it badly. The French and Brit
ish public has misunderstood and mis
construed this. The fact is that Ger
many wants peace NOW, not because
she believes herself defeated but be
cause she thinks no military victory to
any of the belligerents will again
come. Germans admit that they are
surfeited with war but insist that
France and Russia are equally so.
They say, judging from the Somme ad
vance, in time and casualties, Eng
land's allies will be bankrupt before
"the great push" can reach the Rhine.
Germans ridicule the idea that any of
fensive can penetrate the Rhine de
fenses. The past 18 months have worked
great changes in the belligerent cap
itals. Paris changed least during the
interval is brighter, gayer and a
shade nearer her normal, even tho the
war is still the all-engrossing idea
Berlin has become almost sombre.
A rather noisy and exaggerated con
fidence has given place to a determi
nation truly grim. The food situation,
if not working the havoc with stom
achs that the allies would like to be
lieve, is having its effect on nerves.
The difficulty is not so much scarcity
of food as soaring of prices and mo
notony of diet. Everywhere the ques
tion is asked, "When is peace com
ing?" but nowheere is there evidence
of wear or voiced dissatisfaction with
government or army.
German Honor Must Prevail.
When peace is talked of by the av
erage German, it is a peace with full
honor to Germany. It is a peace cred
itable to the Germany that has con
quered Belgium, Poland, Serbia and
the richest districts of northern
France; the Germany which is over
running Rumania and which even in
a war of attrition is still adding to its
captured territory. The peace openly
striven for by Germany is a far dif
ferent thing (involving as it does a
restoration of the status quo ante as
the limit of concessions) from the
only peace even mentioned In Paris or
London a peace to be dictated to
Germany.
But it is London that has under
gone the greatest transformation. In
the fall of 1914 the Englishman was
talking glibly of "business as usual;"
last spring he was rather bored be-
vCoutiuued on Face Two.)
GREATEST G.O. P.
RALLY OF YEAR
IN N. YJONIGHT
Then It's All Over but the Vot
ing Xext Tuesday.
Gov. Hughes Winds Up Today
With Five Speeches.
WOMEN ESTABLISH RECORD
Hughes Boosters Tour 11,700
Miles In 28 States.
Ha.:Iy and Benson Made Rec
ord Tours of Their Parties.
New Tork, Nov. 4. Candidates for
the presidency and prominent cam
paign orators in general will make
their last spoken appeals for votes to
day. Some time around midnight
when the last cheer has died away, the
last red fire has burned out and the
last parader has gone home, the na
tional campaign will be virtually over.
Charles E. Hughes ended his political
travels yesterday but the last dav of
his campaign is one of the hardest. He
makes five speeches here this afteri
noon and tonight will deliver his final
address at a rally in Madison Sauare
Garden which will close the greatest
Republican rally of the campaign in
New Tork city. President Wilson at
"Ong Branch will make his last speech
before an audience from his home
state.
No Campaigning Monday.
Both candidate will spend two days
that intervene before election quietly,
the president at Shadow Lawn and
Mr. Hughes at the hotel where he has
made his headquarters since he left
Washington. J. Frank Hanly, the
Prohibition presidential candidate, will
reach his home in Indianapolis tonight
after a final day of epeechmaking
thru Indiana.
Since September 8, Mr. Hanly lias
traveled nearly 20,000 miles thru
thirty-four states. The Socialist can
didate, Ollan L. Benson, who has made
campaign speeches in almost every
part of the country, is today en route
east from Kansas City, Mo., where he
spoke last night.
The increase in the number of the
states where women may vote for
president this year has gi- en women a
greater part in this campaign than
ever before. The most extensive cam
paign trip ever undertaken by femi
nine political workers ended here last
night when a special train brought
back the women who have been trav
eling thru the country to win votes for
Mr. Hughes. They have Journeyed
11,700 miles and addressed 191 meet
ings in twenty-eight states.
Send Out Floods of Advertising.
Both Democrats and Republicans
are supremely confident of victory.
Both great parties wound up the cam
paign with a flood of advertising in
the newspapers thruout the country
which in volume has never been sur
passed in political history.
The Prohibitionist candidate, J.
Frank Hanly, completes his appeal
for votes in his home city of Indiana
polis and Allan Benson, Socialist can
didate, speaks in Louisville. Benson
has one more speech after the official
close of the campaign in Milwaukee
tomorrow.
$2,000,000 in Wagers.
Probably $2,000,000 will change
hands here on Tuesday at a verdict
which the American voters register at
the polls. There was a rush to get mon
ey down today while the odds fluctuat
ed fractionally around 10 to 7 on
Hughes.
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, former
president and leader of the exodus
from the Republican ranks virtually
made his last appeal in behalf of Re
publican Candidate Hughes, at Bridge
port, Conn. Altho the colonel has sev
eral times heretofore Tiade farewell to
politics, his closest friends believe this
Bridgeport address may mark his val
edictory in active participation in pol
itics. In the Democratic camp, the wo
men's bureau sent women cartoonists
over the city, drawing campaign pic
tures to illustrate points made by wo
men stumpers.

GAVE MAN OF 191 6
HITS "LADY LOVE"
ON PRETTY NOSE
Ghe Was Out Riding With An
other in Automobile.
He Catches Up With Her and
Drags Her Across Street.
IDEA SHE BELONGED TO HIM
Excuse to Judge Was That of
Prior Company Bights.
Uow Walter Pettit Must Serye
Six Months in Jail.
Walter Pettit doesn't know anything
about prehistoric cave men and that
sort of thing but It may only have
been a reversion to the primitive that
caused him to haul his lady-love out
of another man's automobile, drag
her across the street into his own, then
rap her over the nose and between
the eyes to keep her quiet.
That sort of thing, minus the auto
mobiles, would have been looked upon
with great favor in the most select
society a good many centuries ago.
Descriptions of it make "best sellers"
of some very ordinary books. Writer
say the women fall for it in books and
when they know none of their relatives
is getting hurt.
But Viola Doyle didn't fall for It.
She visited the county attorney and
told her story. Twenty minutes later
Walter Pettit, modern cave man, had
been arrested, had pleaded guilty, had
been given two verbal trimmings, had
been sentenced to six months in the
county jail and had begun his sen
tence. After all that he wanted to see a
lawyer.
Viola Doyle Is a girl perhans 22
years of age. When she reached the
county attorney's office she could
barely see. One eye was covered with
a big bandage and the other was swol
len almost shut. Both eyes were great
black splotches and she said the bridge
of her nose was broken.
W. E. Atchison, county attorney,
who has listened to hundreds of un
usual stories, was more Indignant than
is his custom. He remained Indignant
until Pettit had been taken to the
county Jail.
"Walter and I have been keeping
company for a year," said tjie girl,
"and he has always been more or less
jealous. He never wanted me to go
with anyone else and I haven't very
often.
Went on Joy Ride.
"Last Thursday night I had a
chance to take an automobile ride
with another girl and two boys, and I
went. We were driving along when
we met another automobile with two
men in it. They flashed a light on us
and I saw it was Walter and Roy
Roberts.
"We drove on tc get away from
them. They followed us all over town.
We drove down Fast Third street and
turned south on Morroe. Too late we
discovered that the crossing on Fourth
street was barred. We couldn't get
act oss and the other car drove up be
side us. ,
"Walter dragged me out of the car
and forced me into the car he was us
ing. I screamed and told him I would
have him arrested. He hit me here
over the nose with his firt. Ife told
me if he ever caught me with anyone
again he would kill me. He had a
monkey wrench in his hand then and
threatened me with it."
"What was 'he boy with whom you
had taken the ride doing all that
time?" asked the county attorney.
"Nothing."
Her Company Ijooked On.
"You mean your company sat there
and watched Pettit beat you u?" de
manded Mr. Atchison.
"Well, he didn'et help me any."
Mr. Atchison tried to learn the name
of the cavalier but the girl did not
tell.
Pettit was arrested soon after the
girl told her story and was taken to
the court house. He was there in the
girl's presence when she repeated
parts of the story.
"What excuse have you to offer for
this cowardly trick?" asked Mr. Atch
ison. "Well," hesitated Pettit, a big husky
young man, "she wr.s running around
with another fellow."
"What business was that of yours?"
"We've been going together for a
year."
"She's no relative of yours, is she?
What right has a great big hulking
coward like you to strike a decent girl
even If she is with another man? It's
the most cowardly trick that has come
to my notice. Why didn't you tackle
the fellow who was with her afraid
of him. were you?" concluded Mr.
Atchison.
Wanted No Fine.
Pettit was taken to the court of To
peka where he entered a plea of guilty.
Mr. Atchison asked Judge Hugh Fish
er to give him the limit and not to
consider a fine.
"The law fixes a maximum penalty
of a year In the county jail for an
offense of this kind," said Atchison.
"I hope you will give him all the law
allows."
Then Judge Fisher took Pettit In
hand and lectured him for ten min
utes. Pettit hung his head and re
fused to look at the girl who was
standing a few feet ar.ay.
"I'm going to give you six months
in the county Jail and the next fellow
who comes in here charged with strik
ing a girl Is going to get the limit,"
said the Judge.
Pettit was led away to Jail. Then
the officers began discussing the case
of Roy Roberts, who drove the car in
which Pettit was riding. The longer
they discussed It the more incensed
tho became at his part in the affair
Eventually a warrant was Issued
charging Roberts with the same of
fense to which Pettit pleaded guilty
assault and battery.
Pettit and Roberts were both drtv.
ers for a local taxi cab company.
