"AMERICA MISLED BY
DAZZLE OF WORDS"
"Our Nation's Crisis" Talk Be
comes Withering Blast at
Wilson and "Shame'' at the
Hands of Hughes' Friend.;
(By Review Leased Wire) "
NEW YORK, Nov. 3. Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt, criticized President
Wilson in emphatic words this even
ing In an address-at Cooper Union,
which he delivered at the request of
a campaign organization of business
men who oppose the reelection of
Mr. Wilson. Taking as his subject
"Our Nation's Crisis," Colonel, Roose
velt said that a world cataclysm has
overwhelmed civilization and that
"the times have .needed a Washing
ton or a Lincoln, but unfortunately,
we have been granted only another
Buchanan."
. Colonel "Sees Red"
"I have been assailed," said the '
speaker, "because I have criti
cized Mr. Wilson. I have not
said one thing of him that was
not'abbo'lutely true. I have said
them because he has dragged in
the dust, what was most sacred in
our past and has jeopardized the
-. most vital hopes of our future.
I criticized him because he has
adroitly and cleverly and with
sinister ability appealed to all
that is weakest and most unwor
thy in the American character
and also because he has sought
to lead many men ' and women,
who are neither weak nor unwor
thy, but have been misled by a
shadow dance with words. He;
has kept the eyes of the people
dazzled so they know not what is
, real and what is false. In the
face of the world he has covered
this nation's face with shame as
with a garment. '.
"Burn With . Indignation"
"I hardly know whether to feet the
most burning Indignation at those
speeches of his wherein he expresses
the lofty sentiment which his deeds
belie, or at those other speeches
wherein he displays a frank cynicism
'of belief in. and appeal to. what is
basest in the human heart In a re
cent speech at Long Branch he said,
as reported in the dally papers, that
you cannot worship God on an empty
stomach and you cannot be a patriot
when you are starving.'
Soul v Belly
"No more sordid untruth ever was
uttered. Such a sentence could be
uttered only by a president who cares
nothing for the nation's soul and
who believes that the nation itself
puts its belly above its soul. I call
the attention of these appeals to the
full belly of these men who jeer at
the nation's soul. I call the attention
of President Wilson and his secretary
of war and secretary of the navy to
what Washington said of his own sol
diers." Colonel Roosevelt then read the
statement from Washington's letter
on the army's suffering, as without
sufficient clothes or blankets or shoes
the men marched with bleeding feet
through snow submitting without a
murmur.
Raps Baker, Daniels
"This is what Washington said,"
commented Colonel Roosevelt "Does
Mr. Wilson think that these men of
Valley Forge were not patriots be
cause they were starving? Mr. Bak
er and Mr. Daniels have done evil to
this country only because they stood
where their master, Mr. Wilson, plac
ed them. I call your attention to
their statement not only because they
are foul slanderers in everything that
Js good in human nature, and every
American worth calling an American,
but because they show the character
of Mr. Wilson."
Colonel Roosevelt earlier in his ad
dress said that the appeal had been
made for Wilson that "we should not
change horses in crossing a stream."

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Nov. 3. Charles E.
Hughes ended his travels as a presi
dential ! (candidate here today. The
nominee spent the day journeying
down the Hudson River valley Worn
Albany. He delivered five speeches on
the way and after his arrival here ad
dress three meetings in Brooklyn.
In his day speeches. Mr. Hughes
spoke chiefly on the tariff and the
maintenance of American rights
abroad. He also assailed the admin

United States will face at the close

"serious consideration by every stu
dent of our affairs." r
What .Headache?
"We want to look tout that we don't
have a headache coming to us in the
near future," the nominee told an
audience at Newburgh, "because there
are quite a number of things that we
must carefully consider."
; Among the chief of these Mr.
Hughes ranked commercial competi
tion after the. war with European na
tions, "not at all wasted by war, but
disciplined and organized as they have
never been bePore." The Underwood
tariff, Mr. Hughes said, would not
meet the situation as a measure of
protection to American industry.
Argues on Tariff.
"Our opponents told us of the won
derful things they were to give to
American business. We know what
actually followed." Mr. Hughes said
he asked bis opponents what they
were going to do about safeguarding
American industry and they replied
that they had a tariff commission. A
tariff commission, he continued, did
not pass laws.

TAFT HITS FOREIGN
POLICIES OF WILSON
(By Review Leased Wire.)
RUTLAND. Vermont. Nov. 3.
Speaking at a political meeting here
tonight, former President Tart referr
ed to the foreign policies of the ad
ministration and said:
"We will stand behind the Presi
dent when he makes an assertion of
our rights, but to refrain fro-n proper
criticism of a public official is to sub
vert public policy."
Taking up the Adamson eight hour
bill Mr. Taft said:
"I don't xare what the merits of the
case were; I don't care whether the
men were or were not entitled to
more pay. A bill passed under a
threat of force without debate or prop
er consideration is a humiliating dis
grace to the nation."

It was bi'JUght out that the railroads
of the United States now own approxi-1
mately 2.600.000 cars and that the ap
parent total shortage on all lines Is
only about 60.000. Mr. Barnes gave it
as his opinion that much of the short
age resulted from shippers asking for
more cars than they , needed in 'order
that their allotment niiht approxi
mate the number they really want
Any apparent shortages resulting from j
other causes, he said, could be met by i
a more efficient distribution of the car
supply. I
Various reasons for car shortages
were assigned by other witnesses.
Chief among them were the large vol
ume of munition shipments to the sea
board, the Increased output of ore In
the lake regions, and the removal of
many colliers fi'jm the coal carrying
trade along the Atlantic coast. Each
of the railroad representatives testify
ing today recommended the efforts of
the Interstate Commerce Commission
in solving the situation.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3. An offi
cial estimate that 60,000 negroes hav
been transported recently from the
south into Ohio, Indiana. Illinois and
other states, was made by the de
partment of Justfce in a statement
declaring that a number of the ne
groes have fraudulently registered
and more election frauds disclosed
include padding of registration list
reaching into thousands of false
names in one city alone. .
Fraud Develops.
The statement issued with the
sanction of Atorney General Gregory
gives warning that conspiracies to
intimidate voters will be promptly
prosecuted. It Is the department'
first official announcement that actual
cases of fraud have been developed
by Its investigators.
"Among other provisions of law,"
says the statement, "section 19 of
the penal code makes it an offense"
against the United States for two or
more persons to conspire to intimi-
j date any citizen in the free exercise
or enjoyment or any rignt or privi
lege secured to him by the constitu
tion and laws of the United States
or to punish him for having exercised
such right and the courts have held
that one of the rights so secured is
the right to vote for federal officers
j an(i to nave their voteg fairiy counted
and the result correctly returned.
Conspiracies to intimidate voters in
the free exercise of the right to vote
for federal o'Acers are violations of
federal law. Such a conspiracy need
not be consummated. The develop
ment of such conditions will result
in prompt prosecutions.
U. S. To Prosecute.
"United States district attorneys
and invesigators have been Instruct
ed to be fair and non-partisan In in
vestigations and prosecution.
60.000 Negroes Migrate.
"Information received by the de
partment of justice shows that with
in the last three months approximate
ly 60,000 negroes have been tran
sported from certain southern states
to northern and western states, main
ly to middle western states, particu
larly Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. In
vestigation has developed the fact
that a number of these negroes hav
registered in violation of the laws of
the states to which they have goce
and have expressed the Intention of
voting in those states.
- Aliens Register.
"Some Information has been de
veloped indicating plans In different
iiiu in vinlnto the statutes with
,irtitioua names with the intention of
i having persons falsely represent
! themselves to be the persons whose.
names appear on the list ana vote
under these names, what is com
monly known as "repeaters." false
counts end reruttos by eYct
boards; entering of the poll books as
having voted person or persons who
have failed to vote, intimidating in
various forms Including that by em
ployers of their employes through
threats which tend to core the will
of the employes.
Padding Reaches Thousands
"Facts in the possession of the de
partment show In one city the pad
ding of registration lists with facti
ous names to an extent, which in
the light of accurate information al
ready has reached in the thousands."
