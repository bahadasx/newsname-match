LONDON, Nov. 4.—Three hundred
persons are believed to have perished
in the sinking of the small British
ste&mer Retriever a few miles off the
after a collision in the Irish sea last
lpht.
Only one survivor is reported thus
far. A man named Boyle, a member
of the Retriever's crew, miraculously
escaped death. He brought back the
story of the greatest sea disaster since
the sinking of the Lusltania and pre
vented the disappearance of the two
ships with their passengers and crews
from becoming an untold sea mystery.
Only fragmentary reports of the dis

noon. From these accounts it appears

and Northwestern railway line, left
Greenore, Ireland, about dusk yester
day evening for Holyhead, England,
and collided with the inward bound
'steamer Retriever a few miles oft the
Irish coast.
The Connemara was carrying fifty
one passenger. So far as is known
here, none of them was an American.

Plunging along through the darkness
and storm with even greater difficulty,
the smaller Retriever, inbound for her

formal close of the former supreme

pects to speak for more than an hour
in a speech which will cover every

has developed. Very probably it will
not show any new line .of attack—•
ibut it will summarize the entire re
publican argument.
Republicans plan to make tonight's
Madison Square meeting and the pa
rade that preceedes it, the greatest
demonstration for republicanism the
city has ever witnessed. It is ex

under whose auspices the meeting
was held, gave the nominee an en
thusiastic welcome.
"We are on the home stretch,
Hughes said. In opening, "and we are
running well."
Hughes chose Americanism as the
main theme of his speech.

not be deceived by elusive state

KEOKUK, IOWA, SATURDAY, NOV. 4,1916
THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE DROWNED
STORMS VS. KEOKUK
To the Voters:
C. W. Storms, candidate on the Democratic Ticket for Represen
tative in the State Legislature, is making his campaign on the. sole issue
of ONE COURT HOUSE. He says:
"In the event of my election I will urge the repeal of every
act of the Iowa Legislature authorizing the transaction of
county business, of any nature, in the city of Keokuk. One
County Seat and that to be located at Fort Madison."
That means the ABANDONMENT OF THE COURT HOUSE AT
KEOKUK, and the removal of all County business heretofore done
in Keokuk for the past sixty years, and of all County offices now
maintained at Keokuk, from Keokuk to Fort Madison.
This means the removal of the County Seat, which for sixty years
has been maintained at Keokuk for the benefit of over one-half of the
inhabitants of the County.
This means the building of a new court house at Fort Madison, an
increased expense to every voter and property owner in Keokuk, who
may at any time have to transact business at the County Seat. This
means*
an increased burden of taxation upon every tax payer in this
city.
Will the voters of Keokuk support a candidate, whatever may be
his party, whose sole with IS THE INJURY OP OUR CITY?
Frank Oertel, a young man born and reared in Keokuk, is a can
didate for State Representative upon the Republican Ticket.
HE HAS PLEDGED HIMSELF TO RESIST EVERY EFFORT
TO REMOVE THE COUNTY SEAT FROM KEOKUK.
IF OERTEL IS ELECTED THE COUNTY SEAT WILL NOT
BE REMOVED.
What will the voters of Keokuk do? Vote for Storms and deliver
a knockout blow to your city? Or vote for Oertel and boost for your
home city?
The question of personality must not enter into this question. There
must be no question of politics in it. Every sensible and loyal citizen
of Keokuk should vote for Oertel—not because he is Oertel, not be
cause he is on one Ticket rather than another—, but because he is
against & move which would hurt Keokuk beyond repair.
We, your representatives, chosen to give our every effort to pro
mote the interests and welfare of your city and its citizens, earnestly
request you to lay aside your party feeling in this matter, as we have
done, and go to the polls on November 7th and cast your vote for
Frank Oertel.
flights at the world's exposition in
San Francisco.
"Their deaths do not in the l&tet
shake my confidence In aviation,"
declared Smith.
Pettirossi was Smith's flying part*
ner at the exposition and Smith ex
pressed deep regret at news of his
death. "He was a very careful and
skillful driver," commented Smith.
Smith had recovered sufficiently to
be moved from the hospital to a
hotel and he expects to leave for his
home in Fort Wayne, within a short:
time.

®L PASO, Texas, NOT. 4.—Colonel
Rosario Garcia, Villista leader, and
two of his followers, weer executed
at daybreak at Jtlares today. Before
facing the firing squad, Garcia made
a long speeoh declaring he was not a
Villista, but a constitutionalist and
asked whatever government existed,
to care for his family. One of the
bandits was a boy only seventeen
years old.
Shortly after dawn the three men,
tied together with ropes, were silent

execution place in a desolate ceme
tery on top of a hill back of the town.
Only a small group of American news
paper men end some women and ehil
dren from neighboring houses, with
nessed the executions. The motley
group slouched out In front of the
adobe house where more than three
hundred executions have taken place
since the Mexican revolutions began.
The captain of the guard handed
Garcia his death warrant to sign. He
read it aloud and sat down on the
sand to sign it on hiB knee. The two
other men sat down and the boy be
gan to sob quietly. After signing the
death warrant, Garcia wrote a long
letter. Some of the firing squad be
came tired, sat down and drew their
scarlet serapes about their shoulders.
When Garcia had finished his let
ters. he arose and walkad over In
front of the mud wall. The two oth
ers followed. The firing squad arose
and ranged themselves at equal dis
tances opposite the bandits. Garcia
then threw his hat aside and began
a speech in which he declared ho was
not a Villista.
Suddenly he ceased speaking and
sat down with his back against the
adobe wall. The other two also sat
down. The firing squad seemed Bur
prised. Then Garcia pulled his shirt
aside.
"Shoot me in the heart, brothers,"
he said.
At a sharp command, ten Mausers
roared and the three forms crumpled.
Another volley was fired and the
captain then walked along the lln«
