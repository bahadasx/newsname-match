Six States May Go Dry Nov. 7.
Washington, D. C., Nov. 1
The country goesTuesday to the
stiffest test which has been made
up to date between the liquor in
terests and the anti-saloon forces.
As a result of the balloting on
that day half a dozen States may
be added to the dry column,
which will mean that the dawn
of the new year will find the sa
loons ousted from more than half
the commonwealths of the Union.
Of the remaining States, those
that still may be classed as wet,
large dry areas, in some cases
amounting to considerably more
than half the State, will exist as
a result of the county or local
option laws. -
The States in which thestraight
question of statewide prohibition
is to be decided Tuesday are all
west of the Mississippi river,
with the single exception of the
State of Michigan. The South
ern States will not figure in the
contests, for the reason that vir
tually all of the south has already
barred the saloons. The question
is a live issue in some of the Eas
tern States and is expected to de
cide the fate of more than one
candidate for public office, al
though the main question of state
wide prohibition will not be vot
.ed on.
Do You Have Sour Stomach?
If you are troubled with sour stom
ach you shabould eat slowly and masti
cate your food thoroughly, then take
one of Chamberlain's Tablets imme
diately after supper. Obtainable every
where. -Adv.
