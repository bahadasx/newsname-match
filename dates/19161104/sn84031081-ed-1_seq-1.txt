democratic candidate for United
States senator, in which allusions arc
made to pamphlets containing photo
graphic reproductions of letters alleg
ed to have been written by the first
wife of Mr. Jones, has proved the biR

W ill Help .Tones.
That the attack will be worth thou
sands of votes to Mr. Jones in his
candidacy for the senatorship is the
opinion of the best informed on po
litical conditions in New Mexico. Al
ready Chairman SeliKnian is in re
ceipt of a number of telegrams from

that .: revulsion " fu'linR ha be.- j

tireut Secrecy Observed. I
A peculiar feature of the situation j
is the) strict secrecy with which every j
move regarding the circulation of the j
Pamphlets has been guarded. t
Not one of them nas been seen in i
Santa Fe, nor Is there any evidence
that they have been sent through the
mails anywhere.
Kvery indication is that they were
sent out by special messengers who
t"ok tliein in person and delivered
hem to the heads of the county or
ganizations. Whether this precaution)
taken in order to make the sur
prise to the democrats as complete as
Possible, or in order to avoid possible
Penalties for sending defamatory mat
ter through the mails, U is impossible
to say.

To the voters of New Mexico: While en route to ine( spcukiiii-eii-agcii)ciit.s
In Colfax i-ounty mv iitleiillon is railed in 11 political 11 I
vertisemciil, presumably liiade by the republican slate committee, In
which was asserted that a pamphlet wa being distributed contain
ing photographic copies of alli'KCil li til ls .r a derogatory character. I
liave endeavored to obtain a copy of such' p-mphlcl. hut so far have
been unable lo we It or learn its contents. In fuel, s far as I can as
'ertaii), the pamphlet 1ms not jel heeii distributed. If any such letters
lire in existence 1 have no knowledge of their coiileiil.s. Whether true
or false or unjustifiable, ouinit to the former relationship, It would
manifestly he the height of impropriety, even If knew the contents,
for me to undertake to answer or drn any statements in any letters
which were not called to my attention during- (lie life time of the writer.
My attention has also la-cn called to another political advertise
ment, doubtless from the same source, in which it ls aliened that there
are -over $:U),l()H or nopal, htavc o,,, i-.tmi PujW iii'gnt ow-iicd
ly me. There Is 110 claim made hy either of the counties of .uiida1uc
or San Miyucl that there are any unpaid taxes iioii the grant other
than for the year 1UI., unless it he upon that m ill ion of tlu grant In
San Miguel county. The title to this poll ion Is in violent dispute by
three separate claimants. Senator Catron claims to own all of It and
so does the town of Anton Chico. It is also claimed, as co-tenants, hy
several parlies residing In ul 1 Ion in, one in Scotland and a small Inter
est li) myself.
1 am in possession' of It as receiver appoint, mI hy tlii' 1 i.uii. I'or
my own protection us ri ceiver I liae thought It advisable lo have the
amounts to lie paid for Lives upon the grant fixed by the ei mi, and
that has been done from time to time. IAII t"xes so fixed have licen
promptly paid by me and I hold lax receipts and cancelled cheeks
showing that dining my mclveivhip I have paid taxi's upon the g'-.int
to the amount of ff'M, 157. "II. I luileve that there are no other taxes
lawfully due against the gr.tiit except for the year l!)l.", which remain
to lie fixed by the omi, and the court as to that year has taken the
matter under advisement awaiting a decision iihih tax matters in sim
ilar etiscs.
I have sHken in twenty-four counties of this state during the cam
paign and oil no occasion have I even mentioned the name of a single
candidate iion tile republican ticket, nor have I in any manner direct
ed or participated in the management of this campaign.

"Mr. Jones has occupied a conspic-
nous place in (he counci of l'i -esident
Wilson. At the time of his appoint
ment to the position of first assistant
secretary of the interior, the two sen
ators from .New Mexico were, as they
me now, Thomas H. Catron and Al
bert II. Kail, both of them bitter po
litical enemies of Mi. Jones. If there
bad been the slightest ground for tiny
attack upon the private character of.
Mr. Jones, it is inconceivable that!
