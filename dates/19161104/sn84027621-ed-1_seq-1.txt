Dreadful Loss of Life When Connemara
Retriever Went Down
mm
MAY HAVE BEEH ABOARD SO FAR AS
WAS SAVED
London-, Nov. 4. It is feared that
300 persons perished when the Lon
cion ana iNortnwestern passenger
steamship Connemara collided with
the steamship Retriever in the Irish
channel last night.' Both vessels sank.
As far as is known there is only
one survivor. The Connemara was
bound from Greenore for Holyhead.
The railway company is unable to say
whether there were any Americans on
board the Connemara, which seldom
carried saloon passengers.
The marine superintendent of the
. London & Northwestern railway said
aa far as he knew there were only
fifty passengers on the Connemara.
The crew numbered thirty-two.
A Lloyds dispatch from Belfast said
the Connemara and Retriever collided
off Carlingford Lough, an inlet on the
Irish coast between' Down and Louth
counties. The Retriever was inward
bound. Some bodies have washed
ashore, on county Downs coast.
The Connemara and Refriever col
lided just outside Carlingford bar
last night during one of the worst
gales ever known in the Irish- Sea.
Both vessels sank immediately. It is
kvstimated that one hundred people
perished. There was only one survi
or from the Connemara. It is vir
tually certain there were no Ameri
cans aboard. The entire crew of the
Retriever was lost.
LOYALTY TO THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY
To Hon. P. H. Nugent, Democratic
Nominee for Clerk.
Dear Sirr My communication to
the editor of the Star was not by me
intended as a personal attack on you
but was intended to discuss democrat
ic party loyalty to the straight dem
ocratic ticket, including W. V. Knott
and J. P. Galloway, democratic nomi
ness for governor and sheriff, re
spectively, a part of which, including
yourself, has opposition, but I see it
has drawn from you a rather evasive
reply on the points on which myself
and many of our fellow democrats de
sire information. That is, are you
loyal to the straight democratic
ticket, which of course includes W. V.
Knott and J. P. Galloway? Are you
supporting the straight democratic
ticket and will you on November 7th
vote for W. V. Knott and J. P. Gal
loway, or will you vote for bolters
Catts and Adams? I put these ques
tions to you squarely and as a dem
ocratic nominee you can not honor
ably avoid or evade them ? Are you,
a democratic nominee, lending your
support to secure the election of the
saright, full democratic ticket? If so,
ir what manner?
I have asked .myself these ques
tions as to your party loyalty many
tunes since the primary, not with in
tent to do you an injury, but in an ef
fort to guide myself in the full and
complete discharge of my duty to the
democratic party, and I came to ask
myself these questions because, about
the month of August, and about the
middle of the Knott-Catts contest, I
was in your office on business and
while there I heard you state, in sub
stance, to Mr. G. C. McClure, who
was then intending to support Mr.
Catts in his independent campaign
for governor, that you"- "would not
vote for W. V. Knott if he were de
clared the democratic nominee for
governor." I heard you make this
statement and there is no hearsay
about it! If I doubt or question your
party loyalty, have I not your words
to support that doubt?-
j . Shortly after the primary, and I
am personally satisfied before your"
Admitted contribution to. volter Catts
campaign fund, Mr. Catts publicly
declared and it became at once com
mon knowledge over- the state of
Florida that Mr. 'Catts wpuld be
come an independent candidate for
governor," regardless of the final de
cision of the court that had before it
ve determination in a lawful manner
r J that contest and he then and there
by bolted the democratic party, ine
amount that you may have contribut
ed to the Catts campaign fund mat
ters not, but the principle, that you,
a democratic nominee, should con
tribute money to the support of a can
didate who had publicly declared that
he, regardless of laws and order and
in violation of his obligation to the
democratic party "by which every
clean man should be bound," would
be an independent candidate in the
general election against your fellow
democratic nominee and your declara
tion that you would not support Knott
if the nominee, is a large matter; and
matters much to the loyal democracy
of Marion county! You say that you
know what you are, have been and
will be on November 7th. Kindly tell
us what you were in August when you
had the conversation with McClure
and stated that you would not vote
for - Knott if he were declared the
lawful democratic nominee, and by
which utterance is your party loyalty
to be judges? My conception of a
loyal democrat is one who from nomi
nation to election lends his active
support to the election of the straight
democratic ticket and who at "least
remains quiet and refrains from as
sisting in the spreading of dissen-
tion among fellow democrats as you
were doing in your conversation with-,
McClure encouraging him to bolt the
party with Catts and Adams! I am
quite certain that , this was after
there had been some "recount" and
after Catts has commenced his inde
pendent campaign and let it be known
that he would be a candidate regard
less of his party obligations "by
which every clean man should be hon
orably bound" and regardless of
whether ; he was declared the demo
cratic nominee or not. - :
I participated in the democratic
primary with you and other demo
cratic candidates and we gave to our
fellow candidates and to our fellow
democrats our implied pledge that we
as "clean" men "should be honorably
bound" to abide its result; that we
would support and vote for its nom
inees, unless some nominee by acts of
disloyalty to the democratic party or
any of its lawful nominees, should
forfeit that right to our support. Yet
you say that you have made Galloway
no promise. The majority of the state
democratic ; executive committee, ; the
committee elected by the majority of
the democratic party of Florida has
publicly called upon every loyal dem
ocrat and upon every democratic
nominee to rally to the support of the
democratic party in this its hour of
need, appealing . to you democratic
nominees, whom the party has hon
ored with gifts of public office, to ral
ly to the support of the straight dem
ocratic ticket to secure not for some
individuals success on Nov. 7th, but
to secure the success of the demo
cratic party, and you, a democratic
nominee, claiming yourself a loyal
democrat, with democrats bolting the
straight ticket right and left, must
stand convicted of disloyalty to the
democratic party and its lawful nom
inees, for you state over your signa
ture that "I have simply stayed out
of the Adams-Galloway fight and the
Catts-Knott fight"; that "I have never
promised Frank Adams to vote for
him, norave I made Galloway any
promises." As has been duly estab
lished both Knott and Galloway re
ceived more' votes on June 6th than
Catts or Adams., Shall the obligation
of. "by which every clean man should
be honorably bound" rest more light
ly on you than on any democrat? I
think not.
You admit over your signature that
you have not raised your voice to as
sist your party in its hour of need,
but have "quietly attended to the
work in the clerk's office," when that
party, that has more than once hon
ored you with gifts of public office,
cries to you in its hour of need for
your succor and support! On Nov. 7th
I expect to vote for all democratic

ASKS FOR FEDERAL
INTERFERENCE
Request from Catts which District
Attorney will Do Well
to Refuse
Tallahassee, Nov. 4. Catts forces
have asked United. States. District
Attorney John L. Neeley to have fed
eral detectives placed around the poll
ing places on election day to prevent
fraud on the part of clerks and in
spectors or politicaf bosses who may
attempt to instruct the voters or
mark their ballots for them.
A like request has been made by
the Catts people to District Attorney
Phillips of the southern district. It
is expected that the constituted elec-
;ion authorities will resent the pres
ence of federal watchers if they are
placed at the polls and the feeling,
already high, may precipitate alter
cations on election day.

MAXWELL GOES TO MORRISTON
Mr. W. J. Groves, a leading merch
ant of Morriston and Montbrook, was
in town late yesterday afternoon and
bought a five-passenger Maxwell car
from the Maxwell agency, and Mr.
Lewis Yonce delivered the car to Mr.
Groves this morning.
Mr. Groves, before buying the car,
said: "A number of people have been
'knocking you car to me, but I have
noticed that you sell more of them
than all others put together in this
section, so they must be all-right, and
I am going to try ne."
The Maxwell is here to say. The
Ocala agency has just really begun
to put them out, and expects during
the next twelve months to place one
in every hamlet in the big territory of
five c6unties covered by the Ocala
agency.
