WHY I AM A PROGRESSIV
Hon. E. S. Broussard, one of Hie Piogrossive Speakers at a
last Friday nigiit, Reviewed Democracy's Reqniiemenls ol Hie t
He Adheres to the Progressive Parly Plally
riu*H(< of rny aye can well re.

we begun to ♦ j» L «• iniercst in poli
Hen, we fiM|iieiilly wen' moved to
.ml* why it w in ill;,t mem born of
( ongioHH, Heeled from the (Ion
I t, r reunion;,I I >isti jctH of Moot li |,oii
I minim un IlernoeratH, voted it,
j Congress with -ln> Republican
I'urty on all questions a IT eting
; the tariff; and that Deiuoera i to
j Mi mirera from (Jong«ossinnal Dih
' ft ietn ,|| (lentt!,| Louisiana verv
j fr« queotly tlid likewise.
J We all remember that Demo
eiatic Senators, whether fropi
North or Sooth Louisiana, voted
with tlie Republican Party alun,
j I he one exception was Senator
j < bille,y, who, for voting with hia
I aity, wan denounced throughout
South Louisuua, and as a direct
result could afterwards be elected
to no office in the State. Senator
Blanchard, who retired from the
Senate Cham her, presumably to
avoid having to vote with his par
ty, was ever afterwards known in
the Southern portion of the State
as "Cloak Room" blanchard.
Wo could then understand why
a free and independent people per
tested in electing Democrats and
eniild not vote according to their
I judgment and conscience and in
favor of their best interest.
Those who have been through the
i ivil W ai, who had passed
through a veritable hell that had
left scars, which had only been
re-opened by the reconstruction
Period, explained to ns the impos
sibility of going info the Kepub| i
can Party I heir reasons weie
weighty, and the earnest and sin
cere prayer of our parents that we
slum the party that had brought
misery ami humiliation to them
was not disregarded by our people
The result was that the past,
and not the present or the future
welfare of ourselves, our families
and our state and Nation, con
trolled us, and deprived us of tin
exercise of that good judgment es
sential in the casting of our bal
lots. The cry of "nigger" from
lips professional Democratic
politicians kepi us for fifty years
the willing slaves of a Party We
forgot our every interest to fight
over tlie battles of the past.
A form of Government like ours
demands that every citizen cast,
his vote after honest and earnest
effort to select that Party or can
didate which according to his best
judgment and conscience is best
for bis people and the Nation,
For a considerable portion of the
Nation to be guided constantly by
other than those considerations is
a menace to a Republican form of
Government. No one will, or can
successfully controvert that state
ment Every successful form of
Government to-day existing has
extended the ballot in some form
to its citizens; and for any consid
erable portion of its citizens to be
guided by the past, disregarding
present conditions, means a source
of danger to the peace and stabili.
ty of that Government. Much
more does it signify decadence in
a Republic.
When I went in the service of
my Gouutry, flist as a soidier in
Cuba, and later in a civil capacity
to the Philippines, spending on*
year in each, and visiting Hawaii.
China and Japan, I saw that my
people could not without protec
turn compete with those countries
in tire growing of sugar, rice, com,
potatoes, onions and other agrtcul
fural products. A review of sta
fistics will convince the most ar
rient free trade Democrat of that
fact.
My experience and the knowl
edge gained demonstrated the, ab
solute necessity of protection* for
agricultural products, not only of
South Louisiana, hut of the entire
Nation; and I no longer doubted
the wisdom of our Seuators and
Representatives in Congress in
voting with the Republican Party
I was not surprised that our
State Legislature insisted that
Senaror Thornton should burn his
bridges aud pledge himself to vote
for the protection of our industries
before he was elected; nor was I
surprised to see Senator Ransdell
do the same tiling in order to be
elected to the Senate. The course
of our people and their servants
was wise and consistent; and so
was the resolutions adopted at the
(Democratic) indignation mass
meeting held at New Iberia on
August 2nd, 1913, to denounce
President Wilsou and his adminis
tration, and to praise Senator
in
ty,
It
can
are
I hornlon and Ransdell foi defying
» Democratic Administration All
those tlungs seemed to me a duty
that Louisiana Democracy and
their servants owed their people.
Notwithstanding alt those fards,
our antipathy and contempt for
the Republican Party* ol the
South still made slaves of us.
I'hose who believed in a free and
liberal, or a conservative ami
strict, interpretation of the United
Rtatee <'onstifution; free.trade or
protection; high or low tariff;
Stale's right or centralized power;
in fact all, issues which in modern
times divide a free, thinking peo
ple, played no part in Louisiana.
Here in Louisiana we were Demo
crats, no matter what principles
we subscribed to or advocated.
Principle had naught to do wilh
out politics; we were Democrats,
because there had been an unfoi
lunate Civil War; we were Demo
mats, because our fathers and
grand faihers, had been. Even
those whose fathers had been

so
bly
Not only in Louisiana, but
throughout the entire South this
condition exists, with little excep
lion. What a boast for a Sontli
erner to go abroad, or in tin
North, and speak of a Solid
Sooili! Right or wrong, it knows
hut one Party! Regularity in that
Party is the one requirement and
badge of merit
! hink of a Democratic Governor
of Louis'ua refusing to continue
on Hie Atchafalayn Hoard a mem
ber win» js peculiarly titled by
knowledge of conditions to serve,
Him ply because that gentleman is
not a Democrat! Did not Taft
appoint Judge White Chief Jus
f ice?
Tins one party Government is
the curse of the Sooth. It keeps
away individuals and capital bad
ly needed for the development of
her resources
The excessive rates of the Ding
ly trill estranged many Republi
cans In 1908, Taft was elected
on a platform pledged to a revi
sion of the tariff downwaid. In
stead, it enacted the Payne AI
drich trill, with higher tariff rates
on American articles then on corn
petition in foreign lands. This
bill cryst.alized the insurgents in
Congress, and in 1912 the Pro
gressive Party was born.
To us in Louisiana in 1912 the
Democratic Party sent trusting
emissaries who promised that the
revision of tire tariff would not
huit us. We were both hopeful
and trusting, but got a reputation
of the Cleveland Administration,
The agricultural interests of this
Nation were sacrificed; but, as
pointed out by Senator Ransdell
in the United States Senate, the
manufacturing New England
States got 75 tier cent of the to» »1
amount raised under rhe Under
wood Simmons bill. We bad been
deceived. Platform pledges as to
Panama tolls and river control
were also violated; and New Or
leans discriminated against as to
Regional Bank location. It was
time to quit a Party that had
ruined its friends. Land ami
other values dropped over fifty
percent. Our people were ruined
There was the Progressive Par
ty, newly organised, with an ex
cellent platform of principles
which could not, and cannot, die
It stood for protection of A men

many of the social problems; it

Nothing could be farther from thr
truth. Hi answer to that. t dr
sire to quote from the Congre-,
sional Record of April 22, 191 fi
the following Colloquy bdw* n
Senator Galliuger, the Republics«
Leader, and Senator Simmons, tin
Democratic spokesman on laiiff
matters, and co author of the IJu
derwood Simmons Tariff Hill, a
follows: —
"Mr. Galliuger: Does the Sen
ator really contend that when
join with him in passing th»' bil
lie is contending for there wili I«.
no protection in the law? (Refer
ring to the repeal of the free sugar
clause).
Mr. Simmons: I contend thb:
I hat ii'c belu >'e u> /) < < siKfti
That if contfitiouH tronbl /mrwi/,
we would have fro onjar, "
Hie only reason we have not
free sugar now, as explained by!
Mr. Simmon«, is entirely due to j
the war in Europe.
Considering tfiat President Wil
son and (he Democratic party!
have already deceived ns, and that
as a result we have organized the;
Progressive Party; and consider
ing that the Democrats want to
give ns free sugar at the earth st
possible date, and besides, the
Democratic adnmiistt »Hou has vi
olated every pledge and promise j
wherein Louisiana could have
been benefited, we are opposed!
to the re election of Preside!
Wilson.
We Progressives in the Third
Congressional District have uev«-i
been free traders During my «'«
political career as a Dem«>r:ar I
well recall how the Democratic
Congressional platforms were
written with the avowed purpo-»
of forcing our * ongressmati to
vote against the Demoeiatie Par
ty; and I recall how election after
election that member was t«*iioi«ii
riated without opposition in th<
Democratic Party, because he had
faithfully carried out fus tnsrruc
Irons Many of the present Dem «
cratic leaders were leaders then
and served often on the résolu
rions committee We Progrès
sives are siill protectionist a
then; it is the Democrats of the
Third District who nave iban«l««n
ed the principle they then stool
for and espoused the exploded
theory of free-tra«fe.
As a Progressive, f shall stamp
the Bull Moose, knowing I am
casting an anti. Wilson vote.
