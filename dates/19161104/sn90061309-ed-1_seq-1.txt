Aii exceptionally interestiuij
game of f ( h ; 1 1 1 was
played un
(he iiniiinils i.f the Holv Rosarv
ocnool luesiiuy uiiernoon oeiween ,
Fmm,.ir RnhMv'a Satellites nod
Monroe Jett's Inviiicibles. It whs
indeed a magnificent contest from
oven, sn.ndnnint and ' Dnrticulurly i
noticeable was the splendid spirit
that characterized the playing to
the finish. It would be difficult to
single out the particular depart
ments of the Came in which the
players excelled though in p issing
it might bcs.iid that wonderful ex
ecution was done by the brick field
for each side on the defensive
Emmet Robcy, Rti.sp Mudd ami
Puul VanMarter did the stellar
work for the Satellites and Monroe
Jett. George Kidd, Royal Young
and Russel Vest shone out brilliant
ly for the Inviiicibles Russel
Yowell's bud nipping '.aokles on
the line were also mil. h in evidence
The defensive work of Km net t
Robcy. Russel Muod and Paul Van
Mnrter, was superb anil it was
largely due to their g md judgement
rmd dash that prospective long runs
for the Inviiicibles were cut short.
The Inviiicibles scored early in
the game and the feat would soon
after have bein duplicated by the
Suttelliles when Emmet Rohey aim
ed the ball accurately in a long
forward pass but it was badly
fumbled in a clear lield F. Lan
riam did excelent work as center
Carl Underbill took good care of
his place us gunrd. John Thomas.
Lambert Kendrick, Joe Begley and
Harold Boreinaii and A. Pierceall
played a pluckygame and Ernest
Van Marter as quarter delivered
the ball well.
Shor'ly before the call of full
time Eminett Rubey executed a
perfect forward pass to Ernest Van
Marter behind the Invincible goal
line and thus tied the seore at b
Vick Dreseher splendidly refereed
the game and was rigidly impartial
