Police Jury Meeting
y Our six members of the police
jury, Hone. Barr4, Cassagne.
Songy. Babin, Lasseigne and
Reynaud assembled in regular
monthly session at the Court
house last Thursday at 10 o'clock
L and held a long, interesting and
harmonious session.
b The usual large rumber of
n bills against the parish which
. were only presented to the See
] retary on ' hursday instead of
Wednesday as ordered added
I greatly in delaying the 10 o'clr.ck
meeting of our Parish Fathers.
One of the interesting and
important questiors brought up
was the question of Cood Roads
in our parish. Aftermueh argu
ment itwas decided to hnid ar
election and plae' the matter of
good roads in this parish to thte
voters. An ordinance oresented
by the members of the left bank
and one presented by the mem.
bers of the right bank will more
fully appear in our next issue.
The reportoltur 'ast Grand
Jury was ve y fully read to the
police jurorsand many of the
recommendations were promptly
acted upon,
Hone. .sabin. Cassagne, and
Lasseigne were appointed as a
.opmittee to notify the owner
and operator of the St. Peters
ferry that he must .take imme
diate action tQf more folly comply
with his iranchise or else further
steps would have to be resorted I
to, .
It is the general cry that this I
ferry is at present being operat-d
in a very unsafe and unsatis
factory, manner, and for the'
safety of our officers and the'
public in general it is a step inj
the right direction for our parish a
Fathers to takeiurgent action in
the matter.
Knowing the operator of the t
St. Peters' ferry as we do we feel t
sure tht after the members of I
the police jury will have Epoken i
to him all will be remedied-as a JL
word to the wise is sufficient.
The police jury has decided
that the rate of taxation will re- =
main the same-eight mills.
Our parish Fathers will meet
in special session next Wednes
day morning.
Iii
Tuesday's Election.
A congressional election
will be held next Tuesda y

day.
:The voteir of St Jnhn will

The Amendments
S Should Be Adopted.
It is to be hoped that the elec
tors of Louisiana, after the ex
tended discussion had on thc
t proposed constitutional amend
ments, will not loo{ uton the
approaching election as a sort of
perfunctory affair and thus justi
g fy the charge made by som
newspapers that they go to the
oolls liKe dumb-driven cattle and
Y oteaccordingly. The qualified
eo ctor, wao re-pects himselt
h and appreciates the right of fran
e chise, is not likely to let some
e (ther fellow do his thinking for
t hnm. th, lime is past Awhen th
aim;n votinrg-machine did the
importatit %vork of (ratinng the
popular will and now it is tne
popular will which in reality
carves the destinies of communi
.es or commonwealths. It may
oe that we are still shi,rt of pet -
iection--tnat intelligence, is not
r yet fully in control, but it is in
the ascendency and that is a great
deal for which to be thankful
The elector owes his commu
nity, owes his State a duty and
that is to intelligently pass upo
e.ery proposition suumitted b,
him. At the election next Tues
day he will be called upon to
rote fora Presid:.nt, 'ongress-f
man and other public officers, |
and for or against eighteen con- -
4titutional amendments. The
business end of the voting is the i
vail-end, as the Dern.orrti, can
luaLtk eituer have no or ltsg
,,ificant opposition. The consti
tutional amendments, therefore,
will command much of the vo
er's attention and it is incum
bent upon him t, pr >.'re him

because they are aerpliet in their -

The Meschc6be has carefully

can consci.ntiouSly recommend'
them to the eleotors of St. John
