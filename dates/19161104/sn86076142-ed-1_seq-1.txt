nominee spent the day journeying
down the Hudson river valley from
Albany. He delivered five speeches
on the way and after his arrival here
addressed three meetings in Brook

spoke chiefly on the tariff and the
maintenance of American rights
abroad. He also assailed the admin

respect to the reduction of the cost
of living, the observance of the merit
system in making appointments, the
maintenance of American rights
abroad and economy in the expenses
of the government.
Conditions which industry in the
United States will fare at the close
of the war were characterized as
cause "for serious consideration by
every student of our affairs."
