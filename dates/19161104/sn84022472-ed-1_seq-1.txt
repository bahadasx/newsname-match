Man Missing
Money and Checks for Large
Amount in His - Pockets
"hen He Left His Board
ing Place Missing Since
y Last Wednesday.
Last Information Authori
ties Have of Him Is That
He Displayed Huge Roll
of Bills" . in Newspaper
Store Where He Made
Small Purchase.
Robert Cornell, 50 years, of
. 291 South, avenue,, with $9,000
in money and checks in his
pocket left his home last Wed
nesday morning about 8:30
stating that he intended to cash
, the checks at a bank, and has
not been seen or heard from
since-, although the police have
searehed every hospital and ex
hausted every known means of
, finding jsome trace of him.
Cornell, "who several weeks ago, suf
fered a stroke of apoplexy, told Mrs.
' Charles" R. Pierre; with whom he
boarded, that he would return to the
house in a half hour just as soon as
f'l cash these checks." The next seen
of him he. visited a. periodical store,
at Main street and South avenue; hav
ing evidently been &. hank and ex-
v - f
. changed the paper for money.
Here he purchased several news
' , papers, which he intended to read on
arriving; home and pulled from his
pocket an immense rolls of bills. Un-
able to find one "of small denomina
' tlon.r and having no change in his pos
session he told the storekeeper he
would owe him for the papers.
' Here all trace of him has been lost.
Whether he met with foul play, was
robbed and then killed, or in a fit of
despondency took his own life is a
' ; : mystery, which the police are bending
every effort to solve.
The1 missing man was of quiet de
: meanor and good habits. He has
jlived with the Pierre family since last
; 'July, previous to which he roomed in
i Broad street.- He was ''employed in
the 'shell department of the Reming-
ton Arms Cot, having sold out a hab
' erdashery business . in, New Haven,
.where his sister, Mr. Henrietta An
tdrew, n6w lives, for employment in
, j the munition plant. .
Owing to sickness he worked but
.little -during the summer and sustain
ed , a stroke recently which caused
. .him to walk lame, his left side being
paralyzed. Last Sunday he appuareu
melancholy and stated his intention
of settling up his affairs and his fear
that "I will become a burden to my
friends." ,
He ' had in his possession, leaving
home a check representing the pro
ceeds of paid-up endowment policy,
a chck payable, to. him on. the Build
ing, and Loan association and cash,
which. totaled $9,000.
' Of this fact his only close friend,
with the exception of the Pierre fam
ily, in this city, Ralph D. Gould, of
797 Seaview avenue, a mechanical en.
pineer, had knowledge, and fearing
. Cornell had met with robbery and
foul play, he immediately notified the
r police. "
The belief that he has taken his
life his friends discountenance, point
ing to the fact that Gould had stated
his intention of settling up his affairs
end having them in ship-shape fash
Ion In case he suffered another stroke
and died.
He would not have killed himself
with the money on his person in their
opinion, but would have first provided
for Its disposition among his relatives.
Efforts to locate Cornell in New Ha.
' ven, at the home of his sister, whose
husband Is manager of theAmerican
Supply. Co., in that city, have failed.
According to Mrs. -Pierre, who has"
-nursed the mlslng man through his
illnes, he appeared deeply grateful
for her kindness and she feels certain
that he 'would, not leave her home
without first telling her of his inten
tion, and that inasmuch as he did not
feturn In the half hoars time he stat
ed, something must have happened to
-:' him. .
Owing to his lameness Cornell left
his home walking with a cane and
umbrella. He is described as a man
about 5 feet 6 Inches in height, of
etbcky build, weighing 150 pounds.full
face, wearing a small grey moustache.
He " was : attired in a blue suit and
overcoat, when last seen, black shoes
and stockings.
.The police are making, a search of
, ealoons in the vicinity of his home to
ascertain if he had visited any of
them on his way home. . They believe
It possible that owing to his physical
condition he might possibly have be
, come weakened by his walk and step
ped into a liquor store to obtain a
vllrink of brandy, displaying his money,
irhen making the purchase.

Things haven't changed much in Connecticut since
1912. The Colonel has shifted a little. Connecticut is
still in the hands of J. Henry. Mr. King has been pro
moted. It 's the same crowd. The mountain wouldn 't
go to the colonel, so the colonel has come to the moun

In bis speech tonight it is to be hoped he will exhibit
sincere contrition and repentance dvi apologizing to the
bosses of Connecticut for his former opinion of them. ,

Mr. Rowe was one of" the chairmen
of the railway Brotherhoods that sat
in the White House for two weeks
while President Wilson was strug

SB PRIEST
GREENFIELD HILL
APPEAIS TO CITY
FOR POLICE HELP
Ask Bridgeport Department
to Protect Homes From
Band of Burglars.
NICHOLS' MANSION IS
RANSACKED IN NIGHT
Priceless Antiques Smashed
Homes of Wealthy Re
peatedly Robbed.
Because fashionable homes are toe
ing entered nearly every night and the
FairfieMi police authorities have been
unable to cope with the situation, the
aid of the Bridgeport authorities has
been asked by Greenfield Hill resi
dents. -
Repeated depredations have arouseidi
the residents of the exclusive colony,
and yesterda; morning it was discov
ered that the Nichols family home, the
dwelling of the late Col. A. R. T.
Nichols, had been entered and the
thousands of dollars worth of antique
furniture, ancient paintings, sculpture,
etc., damaged almost beyond repair by
thieves in search of silver.
An appeal from frightene'cl residents
of the Hill resulted in the assignment
of Detective Sergeant Peter Hall by
the Bridgeport police department, to
investigate the cases.
During the last few weeks the homes
of D. H Warner, E. T. Bedford, Sam
uel Gorman and an outbuilding of Da
vid C. Smith, have been broken into, it
was learned today.
Mr. Warner's house was robbed of
three silver la'cMes of considerable
value, several days ago. ... : . . l? . -
The home of Mr. Gorman, which he
has closed for the last few years, dur
ing which he has been . in the South,
was ransacked, but Until the return. .of
the owner, it cannot be ascertained
how much was taken.
The burglars evidently have a camp
ing place somewhere on the hill, or are
living iii a- summer home that has
been closed. They stole 20 chickens
last night from the yard of Mr. Davis.
Col. Nichols' family has lived, for
generations in Greenfield Hill and the
mansion contains antiques that have
been handed down. Besides these
there are collections of paintings and
tapestries thai are worth thousands of
dollars.
When Sheriff William Gould , and
Detective Hall visited the home this
morning they found a 'back window
had been jimmied open.' Inside a
scene of desolation met them. Doors
were smashed on closets that had been
locked, antique sideboards and dressers
were permanetly "damaged chairs were
broken and paintings and tapestries
torn from the, walls.
It Is the belief of the police that the
thieves were looking for money or sil
ver, tout the latter has been stored in
safe deposit vaults since the death of
Col. Nichols a decade ago.
As many of the .wealthy residents of
the hill have closed their homes for
the winter and have left valuable pos
sessions in them, an appeal for police
protection has been made in Bridge
port. ANOTHER CORPSE
FOUND LYING ON
FLATS OF RIVER
The body of another victim of the
waters of the Pequonnock river was
discovered this morning when William
Madden and Edward Dunphy, of 44
Courtland street . saw an unidentified
man . laying on the flats just below
Nichols street.
The police were notified and remov
ed the, body to the. morgue at 7:15
a. m. Dr. S. M. Garlick, the medical
examiner, who viewed the body gave
out. this description:
A male, probably 35 years of age,
weight 165-170 pounds, height 5 feet
6 inches, smooth face, black hair, new
black shoes, blue serge pants and

coat; possibly a French-Canadian or
Italian of refinement and education;
wore a signet ring inscribed) with let
ters resembling "E. L. L." or "S.L.L."
Dr. Garlick gave it as his opinion
that the man came to his death by
drowning, no marks of violence ap
pearing on the body. He had been
in the water only a few hours.

BRIDGEPORT'S
WATER SUPPLY
. RUNNING SHORT
Unprecedented Call on Re
servoirs Combined With
Protracted Drought.
Bridgeport is confronted today with
a serious shortage of water in the vast
reservoir system of the- Bridgeport
Hydraulic Co. The situation -N while
not alarming in its present condition
is such as requires the householder to
consider ecoonomic measures in the
use of water until the rainfall de
ficiency which now amounts to more
than' 6 inches is broken. '
The recently constructed "Hem
lock" reservoir of the Hydraulic Com
pany located in Easton, holding
4,500,000,000 gallons of water, is re
ported as technically 'Jdry." A similar
condition prevails at the Trap Falls
watershed where big additions to the
dam are being pushed forward. The
last of the storage reservoirs in the
system are being drawn upon. .
In announcing that the "Hemlock"
and other reservoirs are dry, officials
of the Hydraulic Company assert that
while much water actually remains
behind the dams the supply has been
drawn off to a point where it is un
safe to take more away except in the
most urgent emergency.
Two causes for the water shortage
are given. The prime reason is that
during July, August, September, Oc
tober and November there has been
hardly any rainfall and a deficiency
of six inches to the square foot, an al
most unprecedented condition, ob
tains. The other cause is that Bridge
port not only has grown rapidly but.
that its houses are filled to excess and
have drawn upon the supply far in
excess of even the maximum esti
mates of Hydraulic Company en
gineers. Notwithstanlng the addition
of the new Hemlock dam, the expen
diture of great sums in acquiring
watersheds and reserves, the popula
tion increase in the territory has out
run the improvements.
Only One Survivor Frdm Both Vessels, Says Des
patch to London Liner Connemara, Out
bound, Runs Into the Steamer Retriever and
Both Vessels Go Down Before Rescues Can be
Made Few Bodies Are Washed Ashore, and
It Is Believed That Practically All of Crews
and Passengers Have Been Lost.
London, Nov. 4. The London & Northvvestern steamship
Connemara, bound from Greenore to Holyhead with passengers,'
has collided with another vessel ,and it is feared the death roll
is about 300. . ,
The Connemara collided with the steamship Retriever in
the Irish channel. Both vessels were sunk. So far as is known
there is only one survivor from both ships.
The railway company says it is unable to state whether any
Americans were aboard these vessels. They seldom carry sal
oon passeng- '
A Lloyds uespatch from Belfast says the collision occurred
at Curlingford Lough, an inlet on the Irish coast between tha,
counties of Down and Louth. The Retriever was inward bound.
A few bodies have been washed ashore on the County Down
coast. The despatch"says i is feared 300 lives have been lost.
The marine superintendent of the London & Northwestern
Railway Company said that so far as he knew there were only
50 passengers on the Connemara. Her crew numbered 31.
The Connemara, 1,106 tons gross
and 272 feet long, was built in Dum
bart in 1896.
The Retriever was 190 feet long, of
674 tons gross anfwas built in Goole,

German Admiralty has furnished to
The Associated Press correspondent
the details of what is characterized
as a second Baralong case,' in which
a British patrol steamer, flying Amer
ican colors, it is declared, after de
stroying the submarine U-4J, deliber
ately ran down a rowboat with the
only two survivors of the undrseta
boat in an endeavor to remove the
only witnesses and has since prevent
ed the intended victims, who were al
most miraculously saved, from com
municating , the news to their own
government. 1
The incident, according to the Ad
miralty, occurred on Sept. 24, 1915,
and has only just been learned of
through an invalided prisoner trans
ferred to Switzerland.
The submarine, according to the
Admiralty account, 'had halted in the
neighborhood of the Scilly Isles for
examination of a steamer under the
American flag, aparently an innocent
merchantman. 1
The seamer ostensibly prepared to
lower a boat but when the submar
ine had approached to within 300
yards, the supposed merchantman
suddenly opened concealed ports and
began , firing from two cannon and
also with rifles, the American flag fly
ing the whole-time,, the account con
tinues. The submarine .irreparably dam
aged, went under but was able to
come to the surface later for an in
stant, permitting Lieutenaht Cromp

open hatch before the submarine sank
forever. ,
