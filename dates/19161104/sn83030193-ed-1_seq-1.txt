A repetition on a mall scale of the
police mismanagement and the dis

and Mr. HuKhei had to tlg;ht their
way out of tho building.
Tho mcotlnsr was the last of flvo
addressed by tho Republican candi
date and lone before he arrived at 1.45
P. M the hall was crowded and tho
doors wero locked. Mr. HUffhos was
scheduled to enter tho bulldlnic at tho
Hroadway entrance and go throuch
tho olllce to th hall, but tho crowd
surroundlnt; tho entranco was so
denso that the police could not force
a path for him or arraiiRo a placo for
his automobile to stop and he was
compelled to ko to the Vesey Street
entrance.
CROWD PRESSES CLOSELY
AGAINST THE CANDIDATE,
At tho Vesey .Street door he was
forcodo wait for a half mlnuto whllo
It w.fitTf unlocked, and the crowd
surged through his police Riiard and
pressedMilm a,-alnat tho doors. When
he entered tho placo two pollen lieu
tenants swln-liif rlirht and left with
their Hsti drovo a path through to a
barrier erected before the platform.

Unlimited sums of Republican raonoy
was offered to-day In brokerago
houses and on tha Uroad Street Curb
marnct at odda of 10 to 7 that Hughca
will bo olectcd President,
Whenever any Wilson money ap
peared at tliosc odds It was, Instantly
absorbed, and the commissioners act
ing for unknown principals continued
to proclaim their readiness to take
any amount.
All during tlin morning session on
the Curb tho odds held steady nt 10 to
7 offered In favor of Hughe and C to
10 demanded for WIIkoii.
Transactions during tho mornlmr
aggregated S2000, tho smallest
amount wagered amonr tho curb
brokers of any day during too past
week. Thn enormous quantity of
Hughca monsy available tendod to
smother the market. Furtuermoro,
small bts wero barred aa nothing
loss than $1,000 win considered.
It was plain that some central money
power was directing tills Wall Klrnot
betting campaign for tlio Republican.
Most of the commissioners offering
Hughes money wero credited with
reprewntlng a promlnont Stock Kx
rliangn house which has been fore,
most In political activities during the
campaign. This housfl Is supposed to
k managing a pool of financiers who
hae put up large sums of money to
promote, thn Hughes candidacy. They
consider tho betting market to have
much Influence In tho closing days of
tho campaign, and money pont on
wugeis Is classed as advertising.
No such pool or nystematlzcd
operations governed the Wllion bets.
The Democratic money has boen put
up chiefly by Individuals as repro
Dentin their personal convictions,
and some has come from western
cities.
A broker who has placed upwards
of (73,000 on Wilson said:
"This la not a trim market. The
Republican pool l.i simply overwhelm
ing real conditions by tho weight of
their money. They havo forced tho
odds down on Wilson by methods so
often used In stocK market opera-
tiOHH."
Whllo transactions reported to.day
woro relatively tmall, tho total
amount wagered In New York and
Chicago on tho election Is reported to
bo larger than for any Presidential
ulcctlon In many yuurs.
The extremes of butting odds (luring
the campaign have been 11 to 6 on
Hughes down to even iponoy on Wil

"It l hid the vote I would vote to.-
Mr. Wilson." Theao ure the words of
Mrs. William Randolph Hearst
Wo wero talking about tho widows'
pensions and similar legislation that
ullnvtatcs tho growing problems of
distress among human beings.
Tho great, fine, personal work done
by Mrs. Hearst In tho wldowa' pension
movorrlcnt la too well known for com
ment here. Sufflco It to say that sho
was ono of tho women named by a
special motion of tho Legislature as
responsible for tho passugn of tho
bill.
"I believe the Child Labor Law
is one of the most excellent meas
ures enacted In years," said Kirs.
Hearst who Is the mother of five
children.
"To keep little children from
being overburdened with labor at
a time when they are (irowlnn and
their strentlth must be con
served, I believe, ia a great step
forward In our civilization. And
althouuh this arjltatlon had been
continued for years, It le only
fair tp fllve credit where It la due,
which In this case le to the Wil
son Administration,
"Tlio wrecks of llttlo human be
ings that bncomn futuro citizens as a
result of unduo wnrk and worry In
youth Is evident all around in, nnd
certainly legislation that geta at the
root of theso evils Is to bo com
mended, "In thh progressive age, whern
prevention rather than euro Is thn
keynote, It must bo conceded that
preventive laws enacted aro worthy
of Indorsement, regardless of politi
cal parties,
"Hundreds of cases como to my at
tontlon of wen ones who aro under
nourished and overworked, and per
sonally I feel keenly tho 'suffering
that must bo prevalent among thorn.
In various parts of tho country greedy
corporations havo grown rich at tho

havo been allowed to work endless
hours at somu tedious occupation that
has broken their youthful lives at a

playing. J
"Another pleco of legislation passed
In tho recent Democratic Congress Is
that of Rural Credits. Ily this act
the Initial movo has beon mado In
th Qovernment getting bohlnd tho
