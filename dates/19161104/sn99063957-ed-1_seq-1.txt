trniRTY-NINTH YEAR
25,000 Austrian Suiuiers Killed, Wounded or Captured In
Four Days-Hand to Hand Conflicts Feature of Terrific
Struggle Preceding Capture of Veliki Hill by Italians
Rumanians Stand Firm-Germany Sends Troops to Aid
Falkenhayn
By John H. Hearley,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Roce, Nov. 4. Twenty five thousand Austrian soldiers
were killed, wounded or captured in the first four days of
.General Cadorna's new sweep on Trieste.
j No offensive on the Austro-Italian front since the be
ginning of the war has been marked by such fierce fight
ing. Battling in the Carso mountain lands, Italians and
Austrians have met in hand to hand struggle that have
continued at some places all night.
An especially furious combat preceded the capture of
the Veliki hill by the Italians. The summit was crowned
by heavy Austrian artillery that drew a semi-circle of
fire against the base of Veliki and prevented Cadorna's
men from advancing in frontal attack.
Several small Italian detachments under cover of
darkness reached the slopes on the sides of Veliki outside
this fire zone. Without waiting for reinforcements they
scaled the sides, surprised the enemy and after a brief
encounter with bayonets and daggers captured the Aus
trian battery. The victors signalled news of their suc
cess to their waiting comrades below and then turned the
captured guns on the Austrian trenches to the east.
In the fighting southeast of Goritz, Italian infantry
charged over a wide area, which had been flooded by the
Vertoibilla river. At some places they advanced to the
attack in water waist deep, holding their rifles high above
their heads.
It is estimated here that 100,000 Austrian troops are
defending the Isonoz lines now under attack by Cadorna.
Several Austrian battalions have been practically wiped
out of existence.

Danube, the Rumanians repulsed all at-

Jrrwe back the enemy but Inter was com
pelled to yield ground slightly.
The renewal of the attack in Dob-
rudjn, however, is believed here to be
only a feint to conceal the shifting of
Oermnn troops to the Trnusylvanian
front. It is estimated that the Ger
mans must send five fresh divisions in
to Transylvania to fill gaps made in
I heir lines in their last offensive and
to add enough strength to enable Fal
Kenlinyn to make further progress.

a two weeks' stumping in behalf of Wil

"southern Oregon is strong for the

Chamberlain. "Oregon's electoral votes

Mrs. E. B. Hanley of Medford, who
campaigned the state for Hughes in

boy of only 17 years old.
Shortly after dawn, the three men,

London, Nov. 4. From 90 to 100 per

The Connemara carried 51 passengers

First Story of Wreck.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
London, Nov. 4. One hundred per
sons are believed to have perished in the
sinking of the small British steamers
Connemara and Retriever after a col
lision in the Irish sea last night.
Only one survivor is reported thus far.
A imtn named Boyle, a member of the
Retriever's crew, miraculously escaped
death. He brought back the story of
the greatest sea disasted since the sink
ing of the Lusitaoia and prevented the
disappearance of the two ships with
their passengers and crews from be
coming an untold sea mystery.
Only fragmentary reports of the dis
aster had reached London this after
noon. From these account It appears
that the Connemara of the London and
Northeastern railway line left Greenore,
Ireland, about dusk yesterday evening
for Hollyhead, England, and collided;
with the inward 'bound steamer Retriev
er a few miles off the Irish coast.
The Connemara was carrying 61 pas
sengers. So far as known here not one
of them was an American.
Leaving Greenore, the ferry steamer
ran into the tip of a violent hurricane.
Plunging along through the darkness
and storm, with even greater difficulty,
the smaller Retriever, inbound for her
home port of Newry, in Carlingsford
lough, crashed into the Connemara.
Whether the Retriever carried passen
gers is not known. Apparently few of
the Connemara 'a passengers had retired
when the collision occurred.

near the scene of the disaster report
ed the sea tossing so violently last night
that it was doubtful if a single boat
was gotten over by either steamer. It
appears certain that any boat put over
either was crushed against the steamer's
side or capsized and wua sucked down in
the boiling waters.
The first bodies wero washed up
along the County Down coast, just north
of CarlingYord 16ugh. At the offices of
the London and Northwestern railway
it is feared that, excepting Boyle, every
man aboard both vessels perished.
Hurricane Waa Raging.
London, Nov. 4 The British steam
ers Connemara and Retriever collided
off Carlingford lough, 50 mile north of
Dublin in the Irish sea. It is feared
that 100 persons perished.
A Lloyds dispatch from Belfast re
ported that some bodies have washed
ashore on the County Down coast.
The collision occurred shortlv after
the Connemara left Greenore and was
near the Irish coast. An official an
nouncement on the sinking said only
one survivor has thus far been- report-"
ed.
The Connemara carried 51 passengers,
all of whom perished. A man named
Boyle, a member of the Retriever's crew
is the only known survivor.
A hurricane was blowing and made it
impossible to launch the boats, Doyle
reported.
The Connemara was bound frora
Greenore, a small town ot the headland
of Carlingford lough with passengers
for Holly Head, England, where they
expected to make rail .connections.
The two vessels collided last night in
ibe "darkness. . The first reports, indi
cated that the vessels went down in a
very few minutes before ; the boats
could be gotten over.
The Connemara was a small steamer
of 833 tons built in 18M7 for the ol.s
don t Northwestern railway for ferry
service in the Irish sea. ' Hue was 2J:t
feet long and had a 35 foot beaia. - Her
port of registry was Dublin.
There are three British steamers
named Retriever, all smaller than the
Connemara. The vessel in collision was
probably the 450 ton steamer Retriever
registered at Newry.
Greenore lies 50 miles north of Dub
lin and is near the entrance to Carling
ford lough. The railway town of Newrr
lies at the northern end of the lough.
