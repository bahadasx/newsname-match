Large Posse Scouring Country­
side for Unknown Assailant
of Carl Maier
THOUGHT PERPETRATOR
HA8 BEEN SURROUNDED
Victim of Two Bullet Wounds
Battles With Death In Hos­
pital at Beulah
MAIER DIES AT MIDNIGHT.
Carl Maier, who was shot
through the body twice by an un­
known assailant on the road near
Beulah yesterday, died at mid
last night. A special message at
one o'clock this morning convey,
ed thfs news and it was impossible
to secure details. It was learned,
however, that the deceased is sur­
vived by a mother, who resides at
Anover, N. D., and a brother, who
lives at Beulah.
SPECIAL TO THE TRIBUNE.
Beulah, X. D., Xov. 3.—Carl Maier,
a well-known and popular resident of
this village, lies at the point of deatb
in the Beulah hospital as the result
of two bullet wounds in his body, re­
ceived from a 30-30 high-power rifle
handled by an unknown man. who
rode horseback, and disappeared with
his steed immediately after perform­
ing the deed that ha^ aroused the en­
tire populace of the ordinarily quiet
little town and set a large posse, led
by the sheriff and his deputies, scour­
ing the woods and surrounding coun­
try.
No Clue to Assailant.
The shooting occurred at noon to'
day on the road, approximately a mile
and a quarter southwest of town. The
victim has been near death's door
Bince the affair and officers of the law
have been unable to secure a detailed
description of the assailant. Only
once did Mr. Maier regain conscious­
ness, and merely long enough to gasp
out the words that a man on horse­
back was responsible for the deed, be­
fore he lapsed into a state of comma
again.
Bullet Still Lodged in Body.
Both bullets entered the left side
One tore completely through the body
while the other is lodged in the vic­
tim's breast and attending physician
have been unable to probe for the
lead owing to his precarious condi­
tion.
Reason for Assault is Mystery.
As far as can be learned there is no
reason for the assault. Mr. Maier is
a peiiceable citizen and has a large
following of friends in and about Beu­
lah. Whether or not the Beau Brum
mel had suddenly become insane and
started off with the purpose in view
cf shooting up the first person who
came in eight is a matter of conjec­
ture. This theory has been almost
disregarded by the officers due to the
cunning of the man in covering his
tracks. It is thought by some that it
was merely a case of mistaken ident­
ity but the real truth of the matter
will probably not be known until eith­
er the gunner is located or physicians
succeed in saving the life of Mr. Maier
so that he can give a detailed account
of the affair.
Officers in towns and cities in every
section of the state have been noti­
fied to be on the alert for a man on
horseback but at this point the de
sciption falls short.
Several clues have been followed
up by the large posse scouring the
countryside but all efforts to locate
the assailant have thus far proved
fruitless. A farmer near Beulah stated
that he saw a man in the act of swim­
ming his horse across the river near
the town but nothing more could be
learned of the incident.
Suspect Takes to Brush.
Late last night reports from the
posse stated that they were in pursuit
of a man on horseback but he had
taken to the brush. Every inch of
country will be gone over thoroughly
and the last report would indicate that
the pursuing party maj' meet with
succees.
Maier in Dangerous Condition.
In the meantime a fight with death
is taking place at the Beulah hospital.
The condition of Mr. Maier is such
that it is impossible to probe for the
bullet or attempt to relieve his suffer­
ings. Physicians stated tonight that
he has small chance of pulling
through.

For Old lime Rally Tonight
PORTER J. McCUMBER
May Take Side Trip to Wilton if
Time Permits—Big Rally
Here
Senator McCumber was given an
ovation at Mandan last evening,
where he delivered a stirring address
upon the issues of the day. The se­
nior senator is bringing his campaign
to a close with a swing through the
southwestern tier of countios. Every­
where he spoke, lie was received by
large crowds.
All plans have been made for an old
time rally at the Auditorium this
evening. Mr. McCumber is an elo­
quent speaker. His long service* In
the senate has brought him into inti­
mate touch with the affairs of the na­
tion. No one in the state is better
qualified to discuss the shortcomings
of the Wilson administration than he
is. interesting sidelights upon the
foreign policies will feature his ad­
dress. Mr. McCumber is a member of
the senate foreign relations commit­
tee and has always taken a prominent
part in the debates on the floor of the
senate when questions of a diplomat­
ic nature were under discussion.
He will arrive in Bismarck on No. 4
today and be met at the station by
County Chairman Prater and other
Burleigh county leaders. The sen­
ator will be taken to the McKenzie
hotel. If the weather and time per­
mit, he will be taken to Wilton. The
voters of that vicinity have asked to
have him come and meet with them
informally. Mr. Prater will try to se­
cure Senator McCumber's consent to
make this side trip, although his time
will be limited.
At 6:00 p. m., Burleigh county Re­
publicans will tender him a dinner at
the McKenzie. The rally at the Audi­
torium will follow this function. Mr.
Prater will preside and introduce Sen­
ator McCumber.
The meeting last evening at Man­
dan was a decided success. It was
the end of a successful day's cam­
paign through Morton county.
Fargo, N. D„ Xov. —Predictions
made tonight by chairmen of Repub­
lican and Democratic state central
committees as to the probable out­
come of next Tuesday's election in
this state are just 35,000 votes apart.
Chairman Wm. Lemke of the iRe
publican commitee says Charles E.
Hughes will have a majority of 25,000.
Fred McLean, chairman of the Demo­
cratic committee, dopes out an 8,000
margin for Woodrow Wilson.
Chairman McLean sees victory for
John Burke for tJnited States sen­
ator by a margin of 7,000. Lemke
professes to see Porter J. McCumber
victorious with at least 3.000 margin.
On the governorship, it appears al­
most unanimous. Mr. Lemke esti­
mates that of a probable vote of 100.
i.itO in the state, D. H. McArthur,
Democratic nominee, will receive but
20.000. Frazier will get nearly, all the
rest.
Mr. McLean hasn't any figures on
the state ticket. "We expect to elect
Mr. Casey as treasurer," he said.
Lemke sees a clean sweep for Re­

ets, though admitting that Casey, the

BY ROOSEVELT
Former President Assails Wil­
son in Scathing Terms Before
Large Crowd
SAYS EXECUTIVE FAILED
TO BACK UP HIS WORDS
Refers to Hundreds Who Have
Been Killed Because Presi­
dent Failed to Act
Nw York, Nov. 3.-i-Col. Theodore
Roosevelt criticised President Wilson
in emphatic words this evening in an
address at Cooper Union, which he
delivered at the request, of a campaign
organization of business men whoop
posed the re-election of Mr. Wilson
Taking as his subject "Our Nation's
Crisis," Col. Roosevelt said that a
world cataclysm has overwhelmed
civilization, and that "the times have
needed a Washington or a Lincoln
but unfortunately we^iavp been grant
ed only another Buchfcnan."
Statements All True.
"I have been assailed." said the
speaker, "because I have criticised
Mr. Wilson. I have not said one thini
of him that was not absolutely accur
ate and truthful. I have criticised
him because I believe he has dragged
in the dust what was most sacred in
our path, and has jeopardized the
most vital hopes of our future. In the
face of the world, he has covered this
nation's face with shame as with a
garment.
"I hardly know whether to feel the
most burning indignation at those
speeches of his, wherein lie expresses
lofty sentiments which his deeds belie
or at those other speeches wherein he
displays frank cynicism and appeals
to what is basic in the human heart.
Assails Recent Speech.
"In a recent speech at Long Rranch
he said, as reported, daily press,
that 'you cannot wbrsnip God on an
empty stomach and you cannot be a
patriot when you are starving.'
"No more sordid untruth ever was
uttered. Such a sentence could be ut
tered only by a president who cares
nothing for the nation's soul, and who
believes that the nation itself puts its
belly above its soul. 1 call the atten
tion to these apostles of the full belly
of those men who jeer at the nation's
soul. I call the attention of President
Wilson and his secretary of war and
the secretary of the navy to what
Washington said to his own soldiers
in a letter to congress."
Col. Roosevelt, earlier in his ad­
dress. said that the appeal had been
made for Mr. Wilson that "we should
not change horses in crossing a
stream."
Buchanan-Lincoln Incident.
"We had just entered the greatest
crisis in our history when we 'swap­
ped horses' by exchanging Buchanan
for Lincoln. If we had not made the
exchange, we would not have crossed
the stream at all. The failure now to
change Mr. Wilson for Mr. Hughes
would be almost as damaging."
Wilson Has "Turned Back."
Col. Roosevelt charged that though
President Wilson had said that when
he started in one direction he would
never turn back, his whole record has
consisted in "turning back" at every
point where he was bidden to do so
'either by fear or self-interest."
Does Not Back up Words.
"He has been claiming credit," con­
tinued Col. Roosevelt, "because, in
the case of Belgium, he has preserved
a neutrality that would make Pontius
Pilot quiver with envy, and, yet, in his
speech last Thursday, he said that
never again must we be neutral.
"He has kept us absolutely unpre­
pared, yet he now says we must enter
the next war."
Near the close of his address. Col.
Roosevelt said:
The Shadows of Shadow Lawn.
"Mr. Wilson now dwells at Shadow
Lawn. There should be shadows
enough at Shadow Lawn, the shadows
of men, women, and children who
have risen from the ooze of the ocean
bottom and from graves in foreign
lands the shadows of the helpless,
whom Mr. Wilson did not dare pro­
tect, lest he might have to face dan­
ger the shadows of babies, gasping
pitifully, as they sank under the
waves the shadows of women out­
raged and slain by bandits. the shad­
ows of Boyd and Adair and their
troopers, who lay in the Mexican des­
ert, black blood crusted around their
mouths and their dim eyes looking tip
ward, because President Wilson had
sent them to do a task, and then had
shamefully abandoned them to foes
who knew no mercy.
Words Followed by no Action.
"Those are the shadows proper for
Shadow Lawn, the shadows of deeds
never done the shadows of lofty
words that were followed by no ac­
tion: the shadows of the tortured
dead."
CANDIDATE HERE.
H. L. Berry, the popular Stanton
barrister, who is unopposed candidate
for state's attorney in Mercer county,
spent the night in Bismarck.
Hughes Planned Day of Rest,
But is Booked for More
Speeches Today
TARIFF CHIEF THEME
OF FIVE ADDRESSES
Audiences Greet Republican Can­
didate With Shouts and
Cheers at All Stops
New York, Nov. 3.—Charles E.
Hughes wound up his 28,000-mile pres­
idential campaigning lour with Iff
strenuous hours of campaigning to­
day, down the Hudson River valley
and in Brooklyn. The nominee deliv­
ered nine speeches, starting at 8:45
o'clock this morning, and did not
reach his hotel until aftermidnight to­
night.
Tomorrow, the last day of his cam­
paign, was to have been a day of rest
with a big rally at Madison Square
Garden at night. Instead, it will be a
whirlwind day of more speaking in
New York City. When the nominee
arrived here today, he found that the
national committe had speeded up the
campaign so he will spend virtually
the entire afternoon touring the city,
live speeches are on his program. In
almost every speech today and to­
night the nominee told his audiences
he was confident, of victory next Tues­
day. He told them there was little
new he could say with regard to the
issues of the campaign. On his trip
down the Hudson iRiver valley he
made the tariff one of the chief
themes of his speeches. Here, to­
night, he spoke chiefly on Americans.
Pleasant Interruption.
"Let me say to you," he told an au­
dience in Brooklyn, the last he ad­
dressed tonight, "that if I am elected
president, as I expect to be—" he got
no farther for the moment. A man
in the gallery yelled, "You will be."
Audience Roars Approval.
The entire audience rose and roar'
ed its approval of the interruption,
waving hundreds of American flags.
"If 1 am elected president," the
nominee continued, "we shall have an
American administration with exclu­
sive American policies, without any
deflection to serve any other interest.
Supreme must be America's interest
in the thoughts of the American peo­
ple, and supreme will be America's
interest in an administration in my
charge."
Tours Over Familiar Ground.
In his tour through Brooklyn to­
night, Mr. Hughes campaigned over
the ground familiar to him as a boy.
The first meeting he addressed in the
Green Point section was within three
Dlocks of the Union Avenue Baptist
church, where his father once was
pastor.
Mr. Hughes expects to remain in
the city until after election. He will
receive the returns at the hotel in
which he has made his headquarters
here since his nomination.
GOES TO DICKINSON.
Transportation Officer Patrick Hee
nan left last night for Dickinson to
bring a convict to the penitentiary.
When the First North Dakota infan­
try was ordered to the front, old John
Dering, half-blind, crippled with rheu
matism, and well past his seventieth
year, and his wife of half a century,
bed-ridden and infirm, were proud of
the fact that they had two sturdy sons
to give 'o the defense of their country,
Both of the Derings come of a race
of warriors, with whom patriotism and
loyalry and the rights of their coun­
try to the best they can give have

Yesterday John Dering tottered up
to the state house for an interview
with Governor Hanna. The aged fath­
er had not changed his mind as to the
claims of his country upon his sons
when the boys' services were needed,
but after months of waiting he could
not discovered that there existed any
emergency which should keep his
sons on the border, and in the humble
Dering home on the east side there
does exist a very grave emergency.
Living on $3 Per Month.
Too feeble to work, with an invalid
wife to care for, John Dering has been
endeavoring to keep soul and body
together on an allowance of |3 per
month for food. The county has been
paying the rent for the Derings, $12
the month, buying their coal and giv­
ing them the small stipend for food.
The county commission has been more
or less cognizant of conditions,
through the poor officer. Dr. F. R.

John Boxmyer, a 16-year-old bell­
hop at the Soo, who acted as agent
for "lady guests" of the hotel and re­
ceived 50 cents for each customer he
directed to their rooms, and Fred Wil

swore that he saw Lewis Stone chok­
ing John Shepper when he entered
room 50, shortly after midnight last
Saturday, were hew charcters in Bis­
marck's hotel scandal introduced at
the hearing in Judge Dolan's court
last evening.
Boy Didn't Know Better.
John iRoxmyer, a 16-year-old bell
came to Bismarck from Solen to at­
tend school, testified that he began
work as bellhop at the Soo hotel last
Friday. On the stand he stated un­
der oath that he showed Grace Combs
to room 50 last Saturday and that
she told him to direct to her room
any men who asked him if there
were women in the hotel. For this,
the boy testified, '"he was to receive
50 cents, regular." The boy testified
that he said nothing of his bargain to
the clerk or to E. G. Patterson, the
proprietor of the hotel, because he
"thought it was all right." He told of
Shepper coming in, very much intox­
icated, and of the farmer boy asking
if there were any women in the ho­
tel. The bellboy testified that he
gave Shepper the room number of the
woman who was to pay him "50 cnts
regular," and later showed him up­
stairs.

Wants Boys Back.
Yesterday, spurred by desperation,
Dering called upon Governor Hanna to
see if there was not some way in
which he could induce Uncle Sam to
return to him the boys who stand be­
tween their parents and starvation.
The governor was unable to advise
immediately as to the possibility of
procuring the release of the young
men. He does not know whether, un­
der the circumstances, that it can be
done. The chief executive, however,
Is of the opinion that the Derings' is
a case which comes under the provi­
sions of the federal relief act which
congress adopted when the troops
were first called to the front, and that
Uncle Sam can be prevailed upon to
appropriate something each month for
the support of the aged couple, or that
the dependency of the parents may be
so clearly established as to procure
the release of the guardsmen.
Board Increases Allowance.
One direct benefit was gained yes­
terday. Dering, who speaks English
nill, told his story to John Schlosser
of the secretary of state's office, who
acted as interpreter in the interview
with the governor, and Schlosser ac­
companied Dering to the meeting of
the county commission, where the sit­
uation was explained. The board, up­
on the recommendation of Dr. Smyth,
increased the Derings' allowance $5
per month for food, which will at
least temporarily relieve the strin­
gency.

London, Nov. 3.—Violent fighting
continues to mark the Austro-German
attempt to penetrat the plains of Rou
mania south of Kronstadt, and Her
mannstadt, and toward Bucharest.
The stiff defense of the Roumanians
is yielding slowly to the blows of Aus­
tro-German artillery and infantry
about Predal, and Berlin announces
further progress south of the border
for them.
Roumanians Advance.
East of Predeal, however, the Rou­
manians, advancing in the Buzeu val­
ley, have driven the invaders back
over the frontier in the region of
Table Butzl. They also have taken
Mount Siriul, and Taturumio. South
of Hermannstadt, in the region of
Rothenthurm pass, the Austro-Ger
mans have extended their lines and
captured an additional 1,350 prisoners.
On the eastern front, fighting has
taken place east of Kovel, in Volhynia,
and southeast of Lemberg, in Galieia.
Berlin announces the repulse of seven
Russian attacks against the Austro
German positions on the left bank of
the Narayuvka river, near Hfilicz in
Galieia, while Petrograd says the Rus­
sians have reoccupied part of their
trenches on the west bank of the Stok

Berlin, Nov. 3.—Estimates of the
'Franco-British losses during the four
months' offensive on the Somme front
emanating from German genera) head­
quarters in the west, give the losses
in round numbers, as 600,000.
The survey places the British losses
at 400,000, and those of the French at
180,000.
EVACUATION OP ST. VAUX
BRINGS UP NEW POINT
Paris, Nov. 3.—fmpoftant conclu­
sions are drawn here from the evac­
uation of Fort Vaux, northeast of Ver­
dun, by the Germans. The chief of
these is the expressed belief that the
Germans, considering the western
front as now of comparatively second­
ary importance, intend to reduce their
operations on the Verdun front to a
minimum, and will direct their main
energy with a view to a successful
campaign against the Roumanians.
The newly established ministry of
munitions in Germany is regarded by
military observers here as the result
of the Germans having experienced
the superiority of the Entente Al­
lies in artillery and munitions along
the Somme front.
TO CLOSE
CAM TODAY
President Will Deliver Address
to People of Hit Own State
at Shadow Lawn
Long Branch, N. J., Nov. S.—Pres­
ident Wilson will close his campaign
for re-election tomorrow, with a
speech at Shadow Lawn, to people
from his home state of New Jersey.
For sentimental reasons, he wishes
to make his last campaign address
to the people of the state in which
he began his political career.
Many in the president's audience
tomorrow will be political and per­
sonal friends of long standing. For
this reason, he has promised to stale
his views more completely than be*
fore during the campaign.
iMr. Wilson has no engagements be­
fore election. He fells that the is­
sues are made up and that most of
the people have determined how they
will vote.
After his return from New York to­
day, the president received a mes­
sage from Victor Carlstrom, the avi*
ator, who made a flight from Chicago
to New York, bearing a letter to Mr,
Wilson from Mayor Thompson of Chi*
cago.
