HUNDREDS MARCH IN
GREAT PAGEANT TO
LOOSTSCHOOL LOAN
Central and Technical Alamni and Students With Cham
ber of Commerce, Rotary Clab and Citizens March
Over City's Streets in Downpour to Convince Voters
They Should Pass $1,250,000 Measure
MARCHING, CHEERING, SINGING, THEY
CARRY MESSAGE OF EDUCATIONAL NEEDS
Thousands Stand With Umbrellas Along Line of March to
Cheer Plucky Boys and Girls; Pennants, Banners and
Costumes Make Colorful Picture Against Background
of Gray
Under skies that wept all afternoon at the need for such an
appeal, 1500 stout-hearted students of Central and Technical high
schools marched over the city's streets in a great silent plea to
fathers and big brothers to vote for the $1,250,000 high school loan.
Like the famous parade of schoolchildren which celebrated the
completion of a fifteen-year improvement program a year ago, to
day's big demonstration of high school boys and girls will go down
in history of Harrisburg's splendid demonstrations.
Who cared if the heavens were gray
and lowering? Who oared If the
clouds let down a slithering, cold rain?
Who cared if the streets were wet with
Old Nature's scrubbing? It might
have been the grouch who sat com
fortably in his car and turned over in
his mind the cjuestion of whether or
not the loan means a slight increase in
tax rate. It might have been the pull
back that hesitates over the question
of proper high school facilities. Or
it might have been the fellow who
thinks the redhouse curriculum is
good enough for his sons and daugh
ters because it served his own purpose,
more or less. But surely the cheer
ful hundreds of small folks—the vot
ers and wives and mothers of voters
of the not very, very distant future—
DIDN'T mind.
Gaily they tramped along and now
and then they sang the songs that
have often echoed across football Held
and track just to show they're accus
tomed to victory—and how they after
all, can show real sportsmanship at
defeat.
True enough Harrisburg's leading
bosiness men, members of the Cham
ber of Commerce, Rotary Club, the
younger business men who comprise
the Technical high school alumni, the
presidents of the school board of
years gone by—they marched with the
youngsters of to-day.
And the bands played just the kind
of stuff that makes one eager to step
along.
And along the route thousands of
folks stood beneath dripping umbrel
las and wondered and hoped that such
eager youthful sportsmanship would
be rewarded Tuesday.
Central 1,000 Strong
Following the Rotary Club, the
Chamber of Commerce and the Board
of School Directors, who led the
pageant came the Central High stu
dents, 1,000 strong. They were led by
cheer leaders Harold Eckert, Paul Sel
sam, George Spangler, Allison Skinner,
Miss Frances Dunlap, Miss Martha
Cresswell, Miss Ruth Richards, and
Miss Helen Rote. Next in the line
came the sedate Senior boys, then the
Commonwealth band, the dignified
Junior boys, the Sophomore boys, the
irresponsible Freshmen masculine
celebrities. Then the spectator saw
the greatest thing in the parade. Cen
tral's fair sex! They were in the
same order as the young men, Seniors,
Juniors, etc.
The boys carried school pennants,
but were completely outdone by the
gay hair ribbons, coatsweaters and
colors of the girls. Along the route of
the parade Central gave school songs
and cheers, gaining much approval

from the spectators. At the head of
Central's line banners were carried,
bearing slogans denoting how badly
the new high school is needed. One
of the signs read: "If it is part of
Central's equipment, it is antique."
The signs were true statements of
facts, and without a doubt all those
who saw the enormous number of
Central's students in the parade, and
who consider the small, inadequate
building they have to be crowded into,
will certainly vote for the school loan.
"Home by Electric I.ight"
All of the banners were student
made, and they showed, too, how thor
oughly the youngsters had entered
Into the spirit of the demonstration
and how hard they had worked.
"Chalk On Our Elbows!"
"Our Proposition is that You Justify
the Loan; We'll Pay for It!"
"Half A Desk Apiece!" •
"Do You Want Us to Reproach You
in After Years by Neglecting Us To
day!"
"Home After School by Electric
Light!"
The Color Scheme
These were only a few of the strik
ingly appealing banner-borne messages
that confronted the sympathetic hun
dreds who watched from the side
walks.
Nor was that parade lacking in
color, cither. If you were an unde
cided voter and you watched that long
procession, with its cheery youngsters,
the gay sweaters and pennants—with
just the right combination of eyes
and hair of sixteen to twenty femi
nine years to complete the effect—if
you watched all that and you still
I weren't convinced that you should
vote for the loan, then you're a poor
citizen.
Then fame Teeh
Following Marshal William 801 l
and his aids came the Tech delegation
over 500 strong. The Tech alumjii
with James Fltzpatrick, the president,
leading, headed the Maroon proces

man Todd, Goodell Stroup and Charles
Johnson, the Tech cheer leaders, were
next in line and led the cheering and
singing of the Walnut street students.
John Demmlg, the school's star
quarter-miler, carried the Tech ban
ner of Maroon and Gray. Victor
Snyder and Gordon Werner were the
color bearers. Proceeding Tyrall's
Military Band of 40 pieces from Leb

twenty-four members. They carried
canes from which floated small Am

i
Will Do Much For Develop

Voters Say
The whole West Shore is stirred
over the proposed loan for the purpose
of creating a # fund with which to erect
a big Central high school for the boys
and girls of West Fairview, Wormleys
burg, Lemoyne, Camp Hill, and East
Pennsboro township, Including the
towns of Washington Heights and
Enola. The plans call for a high
; school as good as those planned for
| Harrisburg at an expense that in the
i end will be lower than the expenses
: of the schools now maintained by the
various boroughs.
When the loan was first proposed
there was much opposition to it, for
the reason that people In general sup
posed that it would mean a big in
crease in taxes that otherwise would
not have to be paid. Now, however,
the taxpayers understand that to have
a central high school will not cost
more and probably will be cheaper
in the long run and that they can
have a school equal In every way to
that proposed for Harrisburg, that

Poolroom and Dwelling
Burned at Lee's Cross Roads
Carlisle, Pa., Nov. 4. A fire last
night for a time threatened the town
of Lees Cross Roads, a small village
about four miles southeast of Ship
pensburg and help was asked for from
Carlisle and Shipensburg as the town
is without fire apparatus.
The fire started In the poolroom and
store of Elmer Collins, located In a
double building occupied by the Col
lins family also as a residence. The
other half of the house was occupied
by John Moras.
The storeroom had been closed
only about half an hour when the fire
started and Mr. and Mrs. Collns es
caped from their apartments with
difficulty. Mrs. Moras was overcome
by smoke and is in a serious condttlon
to-day.
Appeals for aid were telephoned to
Shippensburg and Carlisle for fire
apparatus. The Shippensburg chem
ical engine reached the scene and
prevented the spread or the flames to
other properties, but the building the
fire started in was enttrery destroyed.
When .the Carlisle apparatus was
starting for the scene word came that
It would not be needed. A bucket
brigade also rendered good service In
extinguishing small fires in adjoining
buildings.
The property was owned by George
Williams of Newvllle. The loss will
reach about $4,000. Collins had SBOO
Insurance, but the Moras family lost
all their belongings.

about half the Post Oftlce force of Har

"Get-the-StulT" Gutty has sent to most

The postal laws are construed by
most of the employes as to forbid such

most of the men have torn up their let
