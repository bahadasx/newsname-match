IF THE CARETAKER IS CAPABLE
WOULD YOU MAKE A CHANGE?
Uncle Sam Has One-Hundred Million
Nephews and Nieces Who
Would be Affected
Tuesday is the Day on Which You Must
Decide if You Want Continued
Peace and Plenty
If a dweller In your home gave no
help or advice when your house was
afire, yet afterward told you that you
saved It In the wrong manner, would
you choobe that man to head your
household?
There was a man named Uncle Sam
in whose house there dwelt 100,000,000
nephews and nelces. A caretaker In
whom these nephews and nieces had
implicit trust was In charge. One day
a great fire broke out in the house,
the like of which had never before
been experienced. The carttaker at
once tcok such measures as were
.najini tn extinguish the fire
promptly, and then inquired as. to its
source.
Among the nephews was a man who
desired the position of caretaker. Dur
ing the fire he had given no aid had
offered no advice. After the Are was
subdued he, himself aspired to the
caretaker's position. Uncle Sam
heard his plea. ,
"What would you have done in case
of such a fire as this one?" asked
., Uncle Sam. . - - . .? v
) "I would have Inquired diligently as
to the cause of the fire," replied the
'-' would-be caretaker nephew. "I would
have searched history earnestly for a
precedent, and would have left noth
ing undone to have determined the
fire's source. When this had been
done and the cause, the source and
tho reason for the fire had been
definitely established. 1 would have
proceeded to put it out. And sir there
would have bei no fire."
To which Uncle Sam queried, "and
with their house burned to the ground,
do you think these other nephews and
nieces ill choose you as caretaker."
How Will You Choose
And will you ftllow voters of thf
Tourth dist.-ict? Will you choose Wil
son as' caretaker -the roan who ban
put out the nie which had threatened
you .and then sought an explanation
of its cause, er will yon select .i-bbw
Hughes who will allow your house to
bur.x and then with the neip oi ww
,.,,t. ..,, Pmiroae and Morgan et al,
soil; diligently to And a precedent
vi hy it should not have burned?
i Caretaker Wilson lias Kepi you uui
of wrr -he has kept you In peace ana
p'.. if. Hughes and Koosevelt would
alio .- our house to burn.
A.il our own cttUen, Charles F.
Booh i-. is another of Wilson's neph
ews who has never qutattflnwd the
wisdom at his caretaker's pittance
and lws bean ever at bis chief right
hand. Would you forsako him?
And Senator James A. Reed l
another nephew who helped to put out
the blazo when the fire started. Would
you desert him?
And then again there are other good
nephews of Caretaker Wilson who,
wlille the wire not in a position' to
help to put out the groat Are, still
stand by ready to help if they could,
and who will for tho noxt four, years
stand as ready as they have in the
past They need your help and they
should have it. ,
There is Tred D. Gardner who

FESSED TAX DODGER
He Had to Be Sued in Order to
Get Him to Remember That
He Owed Taxes
NOT ONLY ONCE. BUT
ON NINE OCCASIONS
The Great Apostle of Republicanism
and Reform Who Would Set a "Good
Example" Before the People of Mis
sourl, Not Only Tried to Evade His
Just Taxes, But It Was Necessary
to Sue Him Nine Times Before He
Could See the Error of His Ways,
Sedalla, Mo., Oct. 26. Investigation
by a correspondent for the St. Louis
Star into the personal record of
Henry Lamm, Republican candldato
for governor, in this Pettis hl3
home county, reveals that the former
justice of the supremo court of the
state has been sued for personal taxes
In 1S93, 1895, 1837, 1890, 1904, 1907
and 1914, and that, although known
to be a man of considerable means
his tax return for 1915 was only for
$815.
The investigation shows further
that this amount was Increased by
tho Pettis county board of equaliza
tion to ?1,270, April 7, 1916. In Lamm's
personal tax return for last year he
lists under the head of "pianos and
all other musical instruments" the
sum of ?25; "watches, chains and ap'
pendages," $15; library, household and
kitchen furniture including library,"
at $350, and "all other property, in
eluding law books," at $400.
Sued Nine Times for Taxes
The Star's investigation produced
certifled statesments from George W.
Drlskell, clerk of tho circuit court;
NV P. Elmore, clerk., of tho county
couri, and j. j. connor, justice oi me
peace for Sedalla township, showing
that Lamm has been sued for personal
taxes,-as follows:
March 21. 1893, by V. F. Hart, col
lector for city taxes, $72.50.
July 29, 1893, by V. P. Hart, city
coliector, $3.9U.
IVbruao 27, 1S95. by M. Doherty,
county collector, personal tax, $81.40.
August 17. 1S97, bv W. U. Wllye.
city collector, $S9.S0.
April 4, 1899, by J. E. Rector, ' coun
ty collector, $217.74.
March 21, 1904, by E. V. McClure,
county collector, $2.JG.
uly 3, 1907. by John L. Sullivan,
county collector, $30.85.
November 24, 1914, by John II. Per
due, city collector, for personal tax,
?25.59,
December 10, 1914, by John H. Per
due, oity Qolleetor, for $1 10,
The above suit are for taxes for
tfct ytars 190, MM, 1893, 18SS, 1896,
1(97, 18.19. 1900, 1901, 1902. 190S, 1906.
1901), 1910. 3911 and 1912.
It is learned ah.o that not all of
these cases wer pressed to a con-clusi-m.
n some instances the prose
cution was dropped, while in others
the defendant ome into court and
confessed judgment. - An example - In
this is to be ftwnd in the following
record- in Justice of the Peace Con
nor's court, styled suit for personal
taxes, as follows:
Lamm Settles in Court
"On this 24th day of November, 191 1,
comes the plaintiff (John H. Perdue,
county collector) into court and for
W cause of action flies a personal tax
bill, wherein it claims the defendant
Is Justly Indebted to it in the sum of
$25.59 for personal taxes for which it
asks judgment together with the uoou
of this suit.
"Summons Issued to Constable W.
W. Bolton for defendant, Henry
Lamm. Returnod duly served by de
livering, a true copy of this writ to
detondant.
"Dectmber 12, 1914, comes now the
defendant and pays the above amount
of taxes and costs In open court"
It is shown further that the suits
for delinquent taxes wero based on
falluro to pay assessment, chiefly on
Sedalla real estate. Thus, it was al
leged, ho failed to pay taxes on Ave
lots in block seven of "Cotton Broth
ers Addition;" on a house and lot
"between McVey's addition and rail
toad," and on part of block six in
yo.it View addition.
Judge Lamm is proud of his li
brary, which la said to be one of tho
finest law libraries in Central Mis
souri. There Is no way of ascertain
ing a market price of such a collec
Jtion, but it is apparent that many
sir
H CON
thou -.and dollars wore spent In as-'
seiu'jiliiK It.
Reply to Gardner Attack
JuJ' Lamm's tax record was made'
the Bubject of attacks by some ofi
his Republican opponents In the pri-j
mary Upon the selection of Fred-'
erick D. Gardner of St, Louis as the!
Democratic nominee, Gardner caused
to be made known his intention of
avoiding personal attacks in the cam
paign. Notwithstanding the announcement
of this position, Lamm's supporters
prepared circulars attacking Gardner
on the ground that he qualified on the
bonds of Morrin and Barry, the al
leged structural steel dynamiters, by
declaring he was worth a million dol
lars, and then certifying on his per
sonal tax return the sum of $3,417
in 1914, and $3,100 in 1915.
The answer to this apparent dis
crepancy 1b that Gardner's wealth is
to be found In hln ownership of the
St. Louis Coffin company, of which he
is president, and the taxes of which
are assessed against the corporation.
County court officials here have ex
pressed undisguised amusement at
tho attempts of Lamm's supporters to
taake his opponent appear as a tax
Hod per.
DEMOCRATS SATISFIED
Enthusiastic Meetings Are Held Each
Night and the Result Is Not
In Doubt
If the local Democrats have any
doubt of the result of the campaign
now that they have practically fin
ished the work of the city, they do
not express such doubt. On the con
trary each and every candidate feels
that his race is won.
Eery night this week there have!
been irreat meetings held in the var-
ious wards of the city, and the large
audiences brought out coupled with
the enthusiasm manifested show that
the work of the candidates has been
good. At most of the meetings held
tiii vcppk rnntn-piRman Tiooher vv.is
premnt and took part, his reception
i being most pleasing. It is planned to
have a great closing rally on Monday
night at fonie central point.
Thursday night Paul Prosser,
the
voung Howard county orator was the
I center of attraction at the court
house .where he made a masterful
I speech to the young voters of the cltj
uuder the auspice of the Youus
Men's Woodrow Wileon Club. The
speaker was Intioduced by Judge
Charles II. Mayer, and for over an
I 1..... t.Ml.1 l.t In,,. .i1 rtnttittaloatir
,udlence well in hand. The frequent
I ipplanae with which he was greeted
disclosed Ids masterly handling of the
subject which he had in mind
While
here he was the guest of Judge Mayer
with whom he campaigned in the cen-
tral part of the state. The Youne;
Men's Woodrow Wilson Club will giv e
a good account of itself on next Tne--'.iy.
It has done much for the young
itrs of St. Joseph.

The prosecutor and at that

They were stirred at his plain un

case they opuld not but help believe
after they had heard his heart story
told iu simple chaste language that he
deserved their consideration and their

believe that the man who stood before

There were dramatic moments in
his addreqp none that he fostered fy
' sought but just those that came nat-
urally as the result of his words
and thee moments were those when
in speaking of the awful crime his
hearers felt a gulp In the throat and
a moisture in the eye and there were
rteara shed and all of sorrow for the
.sweet motherly life that had been so
ruthlessly snuffed out and for the
three little childron who had lost the
greatest In life to thorn their mother,
In all of his story there was crilri-
cisai of but two things the first that
he had been hounded by the detectives
who bought to make a case against
him for pocuniary and professional

nled the right of a trial by jury before
the close of the campaign In which he
was a candldate but he showed no
bitterness or resentment to those who
had thus deprived him of what was
his right. In his plea for justlco at
, tho polls next Tuesday, he said:
Just the Same Man
I stand before you the same man
I as 1 w as two years ago wnen you
elected mo prosecuting attorney by
, nearly 3,000 votes, although I am con-

"In asking you to vote for me on
Nov. 7, I am doing so not with any
great anxiety to be prosecuting attor
ney. In fact, now, there are other
considerations which means much
more to mo than the emoluments of
the office; and the main reason that
I am asking you to vote for me Is that
I do not want you to condemn mo and
prejudge me as guilty of the killing
of the mother of my children, whom 1
have loved and worked for thirteen
years. I crave an expression of your
confidence. I am anxious that yo
say by your votes that you do not
