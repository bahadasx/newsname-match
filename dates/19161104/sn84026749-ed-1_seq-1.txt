tnat such a convoy would rffVn awav

out, posing as a peaceful merchantman,

By ROY W. HOWARD, '
President of tho United Press.
NEW . YORK, Nov". 4.
France, or Germany, is there tho slightest evidence yet of an
approaching end to the war.
In nd country is there any indication that the struggle
can be terminated in the next two years.
; There are innumerable indications that the end is much
farther off.
Lord Northcliffe, who more often probably than any other
man has correctly forecast the war's developments, is now
urging the British to make no calculations based upon peace
within five years.
Although pushing their offensive on the Somme with great
vigor, the British land forces will not have attained full fight
ing strength before next summer.
The idea current in Germany that France is too nearly ex
hausted for further dangerous offensive iB unwarranted op
timism. '
The actual figures of the Somme drive where the French
(though only called on to protect the right wing of the British
offensive force) have actually taken more ground and more
prisoners than the British, are indicative of what the French
have in reserve. So also the new thrust at Verdun.
On the other hand, the idea current in the allied countries
that Germany sees either defeat or exhaustion as a near menace
