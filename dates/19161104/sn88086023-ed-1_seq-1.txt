HUGHES BEHAVIOR RELEASES
REPUBLICANS FROM SUPPORT
If there are republicans whose minds are undecided
between Hughes and Wilson the news from Wall street
should be conclusive. Yesterday it became known that
$1,200,000 "extra" Hughes money was being thrown into
the campaign in hopes of "putting Hughes over." Today
publication is made of a message from J. P. Morgan,
Coleman Dupont and others sent on Sept. 9 asking a con
ference in behalf of the republican nominee.
No man. or woman of intelligence will overlook the,
meaning of such transactions. Why are the Wall street
magnates supporting Hughes and putting up so much
money for his candidacy?
If Hughes is a good man for Wall street and for those
who want war on Mexico is he the right man for the rest
of our hundred million people?
What is the relationship between this Wall street sup
port of Hughes and the Wall street desire to change the
federal reserve system into a central bank?
Is there not some relationship between this ardent sup
port and the fact Hughes opposes the Wilson shipping law
and favors a ship subsidy instead?
Is it not reasonable to suppose there is a connection be
tween the large amount of Wall Btreet money for Hughes
and the Hughes statement at Milwaukee that the Wilson'
legislation should be wiped off the books.
In view of all the developments of the campaign should
any republican have scruples about scratching his ticket
this year ; is it not the part of good citizenship to pass up
Mr. Hughes in favor of President Wilson?

CLOSING SPEAKER
RepuWU-ans W 111 Hold Final Rally
Monday Evening at Oregon
Theatre.
With Congressman N. J. Siimott as
the speaker of the occasion the repub
licans will close their campaign in
Pendleton with a rally at the Oregon
theatre Monday evening. The band
has been engaged for the occasion and
efforts will be made to secure a good
turnout so as to make a fitting climax
to the campaign.
The following statement of local
republican hopes was made today by
W. C. E. Prultt of the Hughes orga
nization: "With the campaign practically
closed we are confident of victory ai
the polls Tuesday, not only In Uma
tilla county and the state of Oregon,
but the nation at large. The only
question is how big will the majority
be. We want to make it an old-time
republican landslide, we want to
make it an old time Uncoln, McKln
ley, Roosevelt majority; and that
can and will be accomplished if every
voter gets out to the polls Tuesday
and casts his vote. This is all that
remains to be done and we expect
every republican to uo nis duty in
that respect. We will make a clean
sweep for the county ticket from top
to bottom and return such a convinc
ing majority for Mr. Hughes and Mr.
Fairbanks that will show the demo
cratic administration with It narrow
view-point and its fallacious policies
that it is not to be tolerated by the
voters of Umatilla county."
If some men would work more and
hope less they would get along better.
EUROPE SHOWS
NO EVIDENCES
OF ENDING WAR
Innumerable Indications Point
That Struggle Will Last over
Two Years Mord.
CAPITALS MUCH CHANGED
President of t'nlted Press Write an
Article Raaed on Personal Obscrva
Uona of Pour MonUis Spent in War
Ridden Countries.
(BY ROY HOWARD.)
NOTE Roy Howard, president of
the United Press, spent four months
in Europe. Article based on personal
observations; leaders statements.
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. Britain.
France and Germany do not show the
slightest evidence of ending the war.
There are innumerable indications
that the struggle will last much over
two years longer. Lord Northcliffe
predicts peace In five years.
The British land forces wont at
tain their full fighting strength until
summer. France is not exhausted.
Germany admittedly wants peace bad
ly, but desires peace now because she
believes herself nearer victory than
any belligerent will be again. The
Germans ridicule the idea tht the al
lies can penetrate the Rhine defens
es. They believe Britain's allies will
be bankrupt before they can reach
the Rhine.
Great Change in Capitals,
The past eighteen months have
worked great changes In the capitals.
Paris is brighter and nearer normal.
The war is still the engrossing idea.
Eerlin is almost sombre. The noisy.
exaggerated confidence is gone. It
has been replaced by grim determina
tion. Prices are soaring. The war is
monotonous. The government and
army are not criticised and no fear
is manifest.
The average German only consid
ers a favorable peace and wants a
peace creditable to the Germany that
conquered Belgium. Poland. Serbia
and the richest district of northern
France. ,
London Is Transformed.
London has undergone the greatest
transformation. There is no business
and no routine, except war. Peace is
not considered, but more men, mu
nitions and money. They keep poli
ticians off General Haig. There is
perfect organization behind the battle
line. The British nation after two
years of muddling, stumbling and
blundering is finally in the war to
John Bull's eyebrows. (.erman

REPUBLICAN LEADER
QUITS TO GIVE HIS
SUPPORT TO WILSON
SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 4. L. Roy
Slater of Spokane, first assistant
chairman of the republican state com
mittee for Washington and chairman
of the republican county committee
for Spokane, ha' resigned his offices
with the Hughes committees and an.
nounced he will vote for Woodrow
Wilson.
As first assistant chairman he had
charge of the Hughes campaign in
the eastern part of Washington. The
state chairman has his headquarters
in Seattle. But Mr. Slater became
convinced that Hughes was in the
hands of the same old reactionary
crowd of politicians which the pro
gressives fought at Chicago In 191!
and he refused to support him long
er. Mr. Slater waj a delegate to
republican national convention in
1913 and went with Roosevelt into
the progressive party. He followed
the colone back Into the republican
party and waa given a place high In
the affairs of th party organization.

NEW YORK, Nov. 4. The
New York Telegram, evening
edition of the Herald, which la
supporting Hughes, today says
that the president's ovation
Thursday night was the greatest 4
New York ever gave a candi-
date. It adds: "Probably 250,-
000 persons participated In
making Mr. Wilson' stay yes- 4
terday memorable. The pres-
ident came, saw and, if there
had been any apathy in his par-
ty, he conquered it. The part
that Tamany Hall played In the
big demonstration of the night
left nothing to be desired as far
as the loyalty and sincerity of
that organization Is concerned.
After Madison Square Garden
was filled it is estimated that
100,000 persons tried to gain
admission. In the big parades
35,000 took part and more than
100.000 lined the streets to
watch them. It was the most
remarkable day in the presi
dent's life as regards royal re
ception." RESIDENTS OBJECT
TO HAVING TANKS
- NEAR PROPERTY
A controversy has arisen between
the local management of the Standard
Oil Company and residents of the vi
cinity where the company's oil tanks
are located as a result of the prepa
rations of the company to build more
tanks. The council has been called
in to arbitrate the' differences or to
act as the court of Judgment.
Recently the company purchased
two lots adjoining its present proper
ty between Aura and Jane streets
from the Basler estate and yesterday
took out permits for the moving of
the present tanks and the construc
tions of new ones to take care of the
growing trade in gasoline. Objection
was at once made by property owners,
among them U G. Frazier who is
fart owner of a house and three lots
abutting the company's property. The
objection is that the new tanks would

houses, increasing the fire risk and

The entire council made an inspec

will probably reach a decision in the
near future.

RAKKH HIGH TESTER.
DAY.
By a score of 42 to nothing the
Pendleton high school footbal lteam
met defeat at Baker yesterday aft.
ernoon. In its account of the game
the Morning Democrat says:
Summarized briefly Baker outplayed
the visitors in every department. At
straight football, forward passing, end
runs, punting and in team work they
excelled, and the Pendleton defense
while stiff at times, was not sufficient
to hold them in check. On the other
hand. Baker's defense was like a stone
wall and Pendleton only once got the
ball inside the 30-yard line. Baker's
goal was never threatened. Captain
Fosbury. Whipple. Fleetwood. How.
ard and Bates gained the most ground
for Baker and forming the second
line defense, backed up the lln in
great style. Dewey Rand shown
hriehtly in Williams' defense, but Rud
Brown, the husky tackle, was promi
nent In breaking up Pendleton's
plays, as were the other line men. All
are entitled to a good w-ord for their
excellent work, which held the Pen
dleton bnrkfleld helpless at all times.
