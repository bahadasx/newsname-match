A concentrating plant for treat
ment of the ores of the Wander
ing Jew and Royal Blue mines,
in the T.vndall district, was re
ceived in Patagonia this week
and freighted out to the prop
eity by Eiroo Wilson. The plant
will treat about 20 tons a day.
The Royal Blue and the Wander
ing Jew are being operated by
A. J. Hooks on a bond and lease
proposition.
For the purpose of supplying
the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
company with long staple cotton,
a California corporation backed
by Pomona capitalists, has pur
chased 10,6C0 acres of land south
of Chandler, and will shortly
begin sinking wells on the tract
to supply water irrigation. Half
a million dollars will be expended
in the construction of a cotton
oil mill. Copper Camp.
Plans for the construction of a
1,000 ton custom smelter within
a mile or two of Jerome are be
ing prepared by George Mitchell,
head of the California syndicate
which has taken over the Jerome
Superior. Mitchell claims he
can have the smelter ready for
operation within four months af
ter the machinery is delivered.
The new plant it is stated, will
cost approximately $500,000.
Plans for the establishment of
an aeroplane factory and school
of aeronautics at Phoenix are
being considered by Harvey
Crawford, a noted aeronaut, who
is here in the interests of the
new enterprise. Crawford ex
pects to use the State Pair
grounds for his hangers and as
a site for his school, and to man
ufacture the planes here provid
ing local capital will assure him
of some support. Phoenix Re
publican. The total registration for Co
chise county for the coming gen
eral election is 14,570 according
to the official figures completed
just before going to press by the
county recorder's office. The re
gistration for the primaries was
13,522, showing that 1,047 re
gistered after the primaries. It
was predicted that the registra
tion would reach in the neighbor
hood of .15,000 this year and the
totals show that the mark was
only missed by 430.
It will be starting news to the
readers of the Sun to learn that
the state of California has plac
ed a ban on fruit shipments
from Arizona and that no more
fruit from here can be shipped
into that state, under a ruling
of the horticultural commission.
Information to this effect was
contained in a letter under date
of October 21, from R. M. Moore,
manager of the Continental Sec
urities company at Los Angeles,
and head of the management of
the public utilities in Yuma, to
Danny Maddox. Sun.
NOTICE TO VOTERS.
The Democratic State Com
mitte wishes to call the attention
of the voters of the state to two
facts they should bear in mind
when entering the voting booth
on the seventh of next month:
First: The names of Henry
D. Ross, democratic nominee for
member of the Supreme Court
does not appear on the ballot
under the party name, but is
placed in a non-partisan list at
the top of the ticket. This ap
plies also to the candidate for su
perior judge :n each county.
Second: The law provides
that the names of candidates for
State Tax Commissioner shall
also be placed on the ballot with
out party designation, therefore
the name of Charles R. Howe,
democratic candidate for that
office, appears on the top of the
ballot as does the name of Judge
Ross.
We realize that there are
thousands of voters in the state
who will vote the straight demo
cratic ticket, who will be greatly
dissappointed if they learned
that they overlooked Judge Ross
and Mr. Howe. For this reason
we take this method of calling
their attention.
SENATE WOULD BENEFIT WEST
BY PASSING ASHURST BILL.
One of the Senate's strongest
champions of good roads is Sen
ator Ashurst. More than two
years and a half ago, speaking
in tho Senate, he gave utter
ance to the fol lowing expression :
"Road-builders are valuable
persons, as good roads are the
bands and bonds which hold in
peace, amity, unity, trade and
friendship the people of our
nation."
This expression might well
hecome the motto of any Good
Roads Assocation.
Senator Ashurst of Arizona is
now urging the passage of a bill
appropriating one million dol
lars for the" purpose of con
strutting roads, trails and bridges
within Indian reservations in
the United States. This is
wholesome and salutary legisla
tion. The appropriation will not
be a gratuity out of the treasury
of the United States, but it is re
imbursable to the Federal Treas
ury frdm moneys derived from
grazing permits, sales of timber
and leases of lands on unalloted
Indian reservation.
The ''Examiner" hopes the bill
will pass, as Indian reservations
in our Western States occupy
great areas with imperfect, if
tfny, road facilities. Hence, these
reservations as they exist today
are direct and constant barriers
against travel between import
ant and distant parts of the West.
In the Indian appropriation ap
proved May 18, 1916, Senator
Ashurst succeeded in obtaining
an initial appropriation for the
purpose of constructing roads on
Indian reservations when he se
cured the appropriation of $10,
000 for the improvement and
construction of roads on the Yu
ma Indian Reservation in Cal
ifornia. Los Angeles Examiner.
GREAT VICTORY PREDICTED. .
Every county in Arizona will
go Democratic and the women
will do it.
This was the declaration made
by Senator Frances Muuds of
Prescott, the only feminine
member of Arizona senate in the
recent legislature, who arrived
in Tombstone today for the pur
pose of organizing a local wo
men's club for the support of
the Demecratic ticket.
"Hitherto women of Arizona
have had a non partisan atti
tude," Mrs. Munds said, "and
have voted for Republicans as
well as Democrats. Indeed, in
Arizona, no Republicans could
be elected if Democrats did not
vote for them. This year there
has grown up an antagonism
against the Republicans because
of the fact that they are aiding
in the campaign agains the De
mocratic party by the Woman's
Party.
Mrs. Munds predicts that every
county in the state will go Dem
ocratic. She does not believe
that Tom Campbell will even
carry his own county of Yava
pai. She looks for a majority
of 1200 in Yuma county. Pros
pector. From a perfectly authorative
source it is learned that the Ray
Herculese Mining company has
recently placed orders for be
tween $750,000 and $1,000,000
worth of material and machinery
for the equipment of its property,
which adjoins the Ray Consoli
dated mine. These orders have
been placed with different large
manufacturing concerns of the
country, one of them being for a
head frame structural steel and
corrugated iron, which was
awarded to the El Paso Bridge
and Iron company. Blade.
The Arizona state fair com
mission has the iair grounds
nearly ready for the reception of
what will doubtless be the larg
est crowds that have ever been
inside the gates, when the fair
opens November 13. Harvey
Crawford, the aviator and build
er of aeroplanes, is already in
Phoenix and it has just leaked
out that he is to stay here and
open a school of aviation at the
state fair grounds. Crawford
has with him his large passenger
carrying machine, in which he
will take visitors co the fair.
A GUIDE TO VOTERS.
1. Compare the achievements
of Charles E. Hughes as govern
or of New York with the achieve
ments of Woodrow Wilson as
governor of New Jersey and
president of the. United States.
2. Compare Mr. Hughes'
speeches on the issues of the
campaign with President Wil
son's speeches. -
The voter who does this with
out passion and without preju
dice can come to only one con
clusion: That President Wilson
ought to be re-elected by the
greatest popular majority than
any candidate ever received.

Last evening we attended a
"movie" show in Kingman and
after we read ovar 40 or 50 ad
vertising signs we cared little
how bad the pictures might be.
The people of Kingman are hav
ing put over on them, especially
those that attend moving pic
tures, the rawest kind of advert
ising dodges. You go early to
get a good seat and they impose
on you 40 or more advertise
ments. Then when the pictures
are thrown on the screen, you
get a view once in a while
through the late comers who do
not care to be compelled to put
in an hour reading the advertise
ments. Miner.
