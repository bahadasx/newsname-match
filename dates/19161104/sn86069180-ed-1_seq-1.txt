Copeland Jury Brings in Verdict
After Being Out Four
. - Days.
.Second Trial In Killing of Black
the Anti-Catholic .Lecturer,
in Texas.
-Judge States Defendants Had
Right to Protest Against
' 'Slanderous Lecturers.
"ATRIAL OF ATTORNEY RYAN NEXT
After being out since Saturday
evening at 7 o'clock the Jury In
the Copeland murder case at Mar
shall, Texas, returned a verdict of
not guilty Wednesday morning, this
feeing the second acquittal in the
vases arising out of tho killing of
the A. P. A. lecturer, William
Black, in February, 1915. One
other, George Ryan, Is yet to be
tried, Mb caBe coming up next
Wednesday. It will be remem
bered that John Copeland, a cashier
In a Marshall bank; George Ryan,
a.n attorney, and John. Rogers, a
contractor, called upon Black in his
hotel at Marshall to protest against
'the slandering lectures of Black.
'In tho fight that followed Rogers
and Black were killed and Cope
land wounded, the shooting of
'Rogers and Copeland being done
by Black and Clarence Hall, a gun
tm&tt that accompanied Black as a
bodyguard. Another present at the
time was a wayward girl, who had
fceen taken from a Good Shepherd
(Home for wayward girls, she pos
ilng sometimes as an ex-nun. Black's
'ife was not traveling with him,
It being rumored that she had left
him. Last Saturday Mr. Copeland
look the stand and told his version
al the shooting as follows:
He declared that the only shot
lie fired was directed at Clarence
iff. Hall, the lecturer's business
agent, and said he did not know
who killed Black. After three wit
nesses had been examined tho de
fense jested. Copeland did not
nee osittradlct himself. He said
ithelectureT was the first to draw
hl-S.tgUB. , ,.t.nX-.. ,,,.-'Cm
The most dramatic moment of the
"trial came when he bared his body
Uo show tho jury the wound In his
vibdomen ho received when fired on
by Hall, so far the chief witness of
the State. Ho testified that as a
result of this and two other wounds
'ho was incapacitated for nearly four
months. In response to question
ing, Copeland said he went to con
fer with Black and to protest
against his delivering a second lec
ture in Marshall regarding the
Roman Catholic church. He said
ho would not have made tho trip
If he thought trouble would result.
"Ho armed himself, however, ho
(testified, because he had been
warned that Black was "a bad
man."
Copeland said he had been cash
ier df tho Marshall State Bank for
the last eleven years and that he
'had been married nineteen years,
"had -a twelve-year-old daughter and
was n. member of the Roman Cath
olic church and the Knights of
'Columbus. He said there was a
in&thollc convent in Marshall and
that Ms daughter attended school
at the convent. On the morning of
February 3, he said, he went to the
bank as usual and there heard
about a lecture delivered by Will
iam Black the night before. John
B. Teese, who worked in the bank,
fktild him and showed him Black's
circular.
"Teese- told me that Black, in
'his speech, denounced priests and
nuns and declared the confessional
Infamous and iniquitous," said
'Copeland. " Teese said that Black
i stated In the lecture that he had
i several encounters with Catholics,
carried 'seven bullets and one stab
wound he had received from Cath
olics, was always on tho outlook
'for trouble and went always pre
pared." .Copeland said he discussed the
lecture with several persons that
day. Ho considered It "a direct at
tack on my home." Among those
ho talked with were George Ryan,
im. attorney, and John Rogers, a
contractor. That evening, he said,
ho went by appointment to meet
'Ryan and Rogers and the three
went to the hotel to see Black.
"Were you armed?"
"Yes," replied tho witness. "I
had a 41-caliber Colt, which was
offered in evidence. I did not deem
it safe to go without it. I had
been warned that these were bad
men. And I remembered that in
'bis lecture the night before Black
had said ho was prepared,"
"Was Ttogers armed?"
-No."
"Was "Ryan armed?"
"I couldn't say about that."
"Mr. Copeland," said Mr. Roy
slon. suddenly, "who killed Black?"
' don't 'know," answered ipe
witnGM)
"DId'-you shoot Black?"
"No, sir1."
"'Did youvJhoot at Black?"
'"No sir."
"Copeland said Tie did not or
dinarily go armea.
."What had all yau men agreed
on before you went to see Black?"
the witness was asked on CrOSS-eX-amlnatlon.
"To use any reasonable argument
and. it necessary, tell him he eould
not slander and outrage u any.
i.worelM
.jfttftge "Brts in his charge to
tho Jury stated that the prisoner
and his friends had a perfect right
to call on Black and protest against
the slanders, part of his charge be
ing as follows:
"And in this connection you are
further charged that If you believe
from the evidence that tho said
John Copeland, and othors, had
been informed that the said Black
and his manager and companion,
C. F. Hall, were desperate and dan
gerous men and that they habitually
went armed, then you are instructed j
mat me sam jonn iropeiana, ana
those who accompanied him, had
the right to arm themselves in go
ing to tho room ' of the said Will
lam Black as heretofore stated, and
that if the said Black, or his said
companion, Hall, acting with him,
made any demonstration to do the
said John Copeland serious bodily
Injury or that the said John Cope
land, judging from his standpoint,
thought that tho saia Black, or his
companion, C. P. Hall, was making
a demonstration to do the said
Copeland serious bodily Injury,
then and In that event tho said
John Copeland would have the right
and did have the right to kill the
said William Black or C. F. Hall;
and If you have a reasonable doubt
as to whether the said Black made
a demonstration to do the said
John Copeland serious bodily In
Jury, or that John' Copeland so
believed, from his standpoint, then
and In that event, or both, you will
acquit tho defendant and say by
your verdict not guilty."
INDIANAPOLIS.
In his elegant residence on North
Alabama street, Indianapolis, and
later in Sts. Peter and Paul Cathe
dral many gathered last Saturday
to honor the memory of their rela
tive and friend, the late John P.
Finn. With loving tenderness and
with voices filled with grief many
clergymen, relatives, friends and
business associates tendered their
last respects to the memory of one

and sympathetic heart and manly
qualifications. Eyes were dimmed
with tears and voices chocked with
emotion as Bishop Chatrand re
viewed the exemplary life of his
devout parishioner and personal
friend of a former day. Mr. Finn
was a modest, Just man, broad of
vision, lenient and forbearing. He
was a faithful member of the Cathe
dral, the Knights of Columbus,
Ancient Order Hibernians, Elks and
many other social and fraternal
societies attached to the Catholic
church. On March 17, .1906, he
was Grand Marshal of the thirty

ful service to the Louisville &
Nashville Railroad Company were
retired on pension. Among these
was Daniel J. Duane, who entered

IRELAND
Recent Arrivals Confirm Kc-
ports Relative to Approch-
ing Crisis.
Work of Farmers and Agricutu-
ral Societies Now Practically
Destroyed.
No Mlstakiug Country's Opposi
tion to Compulsory Military
Service.
TAXATION HAS NEARLY DOUBLED
Through the Irish Press and
News Service and late arrivals in
New? YorkL comes . information '. that
fleefofifreltlate'amejsilsipjyjng,
dally from Liverpool to Dublin and
Belfast, bringing numerous supplies
of live stock, and farm products
from all parts "of Ireland. With the
approach of the harvest season
British Government inspectors vis
ited every district, making an in
ventory of the food and fodder sup
plies. An arbitrary price was fixed
on all crops and live stock, from
which decision there was no appeal.
The military authorities fixed a
scale of prices without regard to
arylng local conditions or future
needs, and failure to sell at their
figure results in confiscation. Al
ready the country has been depleted
of its best blooded stock and there
is a lamentable scarcity of pedigree
cattle and horses. With a surpris
ing lack of foresight the Govern
ment has practically destroyed tho
work of many years, during which
the Irish fanners and agricultural
societies have been perfecting the
standard of live stock. The cattle
raising and horse breeding indus
tries are almost extinct and no pro
vision is made for future needs.
The results of these measures can
not fail to be disastrous. Excluded
from the labor market, deprived of
the necessary means of subsistence,
there Is no alternative for many
Irishmen but to Join the British
army or face starvation. With
headquarters at the front calling
for more men and conscription for
Irishmen advocated by all the lead
ing English statesmen, the question
to be decided is whether will tho
British Government attempt to en
force conscription in Ireland by
acute economic pressure or by re
sorting to armed force. In either
event lies potential revolution.
The Irish people are a unit
against conscription. In this the
Orangeman of the North is. in ac
cord with the Catholic of the South,
At public meetings as well as at
the meetings of the local and county
boards resolutions against conscrip
tion are being passed. There is no
mistaking that the entire country
is opposed to compulsory military
service. Even the Tory M. P.'s for
the North of Ireland are afraid to
come out openly in favor of con
scription. Sir Edward Carson is
alone among his colleagues in
favoring the extension of the mili
tary service act to Ireland, but he
Is not an Ulster man nor does he
represent an Ulster constituency.
There is one thing that is recog
nized by Cathqlic and Protestant,
by Home Ruler and Tory and by
Separatist and Orangemen, and
that is that if conscription is at
tempted In Ireland It will take a
large army to enforce it, and that
blood will flow aB freely over Ire
land as on the battlefields of Eur
ope.
So far the Intentions of tho Gov
ernment have not been revealed,
but well informed persons say that
tho probability Is that the Irish
difficulty will not be aggravated by
the addition of enforced military
Bervlce. While ultra-loyallstB are
clamoring for conscription thought
ful men are advising caution, and
this advice is not tendered for the
sake of Ireland, but for the best
Interests of the British empire.
According to a late treasury re
turn the taxation of Ireland has
nearly doubled in Ave years. The
revenue derived from Ireland was
In 19100 911, $49,665,000, and the
RIOTS IN ATHENS, GREECE
following the occupation of part of
Photo shows mounted omcers uis
revenue for 1915-T916, the last fi
nancial year, was $90,415,000. This
rapid increase Inr taxation has
alarmed Irish business men and the
prospect at present is that the ex
isting excessive taxation will be
doubled In the near future. As
Ireland has always been overtaxed
in proportion to her resources. It
will be hard to bear the present
and the impending new burdens.
The taxation question is coming to
the front and, like the taxation of
the American colonies, it may lead
to serious consequences.
MISLEADING

FOOLISH CHARGES ARE REFUTED
In this week's issue of Our Sun
day Visitor the editor, Rev. Father
Noll, speaks out in no uncertain
words In refutation of charges and
misrepresentations of tho position
of the Catholic clergy in tho Presi
dential campaign now closing.
Father Noll says:
The religious issue is very much
to the front in this campaign, and
will probably lead many an Ignor
ant person to vote against the best
Interests of his community. We
are publishing in this Issue some
expressions of our country's biggest
men both of the past and present
which are severely condemnatory
of this worst form of un-Amerlcan-Ism.
On tho part of tho politicians
themselves who Inject religion Into
the campaign there is no sincerity,
but their action wins the support
of the lawless element, of the op
ponents of all religion, and of the
many people with whom dread of
Rome has become a second nature.
Far from being in politics, .the
Catholic church Is scrupulously
careful to remain out of the same.
This Is true oven of Catholic socie
ties and organizations. The writer
knows of a desire on tho part of
many Catholic editors to, talk more
on the Mexican situation, but fail
to do so lest it appear to have a
political significance; he knows of
some Catholic societies which had
Intended to launch some civic move
ment, but are postponing the same
until after election for the same
reason." Several Bishops have of
late publicly reprimanded Catholic
politicians, who In advocating some
political measures left the impres
sion that they were doing- it as
Catholics. Eastern papers recently
accused the Catholic clergy of In
diana of working openly in behalf
of one candidate. There Is not a
grain of truth in the charge; no
body would be In better position 'to
know if this were true than the
editor of this paper, which Is pub
lished In Indiana.
Only last week the editor was
present at a gathering of 125
priests from different States, and
when Bomo one, out of a little
curiosity, innocently suggested that
a straw vote be taken among them,
it was quickly turned down, be
cause it savored of tho "church in
politics." An effort on the part of
German Protestant ministers to en
list the co-operation of German
Catholic priests to defeat one of
the Presidential nominees has been
futile. Everywhere our enemies
are the ones In the political field,
yet the accused are the Innocent
ones.
Says Cardinal Gibbons:
"I am not In politics and I never
have authorized any one to quote
me as favoring either candidate for
the Presidency. Every Catholic
voter has an inherent right to vote
according to his own individual con
science, and I am sure that the
Roman Catholic hierarchy of the
United States would never interfere
with that right."

CAMPAIGN
Practically Closes Tonight and
Indications Point to a Wil
son Victory.
Workcrsof All Classes Interested
in Progress of Sight Hour
Day.
Hughes, Corporation Candidate
Against Wilson, Candidate
of the People.
BIG DEMOCRATIC RALLY TONIGHT
The great Presidential campaign
closes practically tonight In every
town and hamlet in the United
States, and with the closing of the
case for either side "it now noes to
"the" juryhexrTuesdayl'the "jury"be
ing the people, their decision the
final and only one that can be r e ri
del ed. Tho case to be decided Is
not merely AVilson vs. Hughes, but
the people vs. the moneyed inter
ests, a victory for Wilson meaning
that the people will have a repre
sentative at Washington for the
coining four years, while a victory
for Hughes means that J. Plerpont
Morgan and his associates will con
trol absolutely the destinies of this
country for four years, and in that
time tho people will have no voice
in our Government, as Hughes and
the G. O. P. leaders will naturally
have to obey the wishes of the
money barons who are now flood
ing the country with money to
swing doubtful States. This group
Is composed of tho men who are
now making big money on war
munitions, sold to the Allies, and
In the event of Hughes' election this
Bdme group will see to it that this
country will drop its neutrality and
obey the wishes of England, there
being no denial of the fact that
Plerpont Morgan is King George's
representative In this country, and
the American flag means nothing to
the moneyed Interests, who toady to
J'jhn Bull.
Discussion of the Mexican situa
tion, the European war, the tariff
and every other issue Introduced in
this campaign has been swept aside
by the eight-hour question. Work
ing men and working women realize
that tho re-election of Wilson
means the further progress of the
eight-hour movement, and they
know that the introduction of other
matters by the Republican leaders
Is intended to cloud the issue. The
attack on the railroad men for their
backing of the Adamson eight-hour
bill was and is an attack on the
whole working people, the trusts
and corporations fighting tho eight-
hour day, which they realize will
be a certainty in the event of Demo
cratic success, not only for tho rail
road men, who are the targets for
the Republican speakers just now,
but for the working peoplo of every
class. As stated above, the war,
tariff and all other issues should
be swept aside by tho. workers and
on next Tuesday tho trusts and cap
italists should bo forced to bow to
the wishes of the majority. A de
feat of Wilson can not be construed
in any other way than a reflection
on the intelligence of the working
people.
Thoro has been a studied attempt
in this campaign to class the voters
In blocks, designating them as the
Irish-American vote, tho German
American vote, the Catholic vote,
etc., the latest offender being the
Courier-Journal correspondent, who
spoke of the Catholic vote in New
York. Just like the labor vote, the
above votes are myths and the
would-be leaders who profess to de
liver the above votes In bulk, should
be squelched, It Is an insult to
the average German-American,
Irish-American or Catholic to see In
tho dally press how his vote and
the vote of his fellows are supposed
to be delivered. The surest way to
quelch tho above would be to give
Wilson a decisive majority in tho
coming election. Recently a well
known Catholic clergyman and one
of the brightest men in this State
told the writer that it was disgust
ing to see the Catholic vote desig
nated as a bulk vote from time to
time, and this good priest said then,
as every Intelligent man knows, that
the Catholic, German-American,
Irish-American and labor vote is a
myth, everyono voting pretty near
according to his party convictions
and no one can swing that vote or
"deliver" it in bulk.
Following up the publication of
the Cantrlll forged letter and the
Hughes railroad club, which was
made up of registered Republicans
and unknowns, the Louisville Her
ald came to tho bat this week with
another Munchausen yarn, telling
Of how $10,000 had been on deposit
here for the past two weeks to bet
on Hughes at odds of ten to seven
and ten to six, when every stock
exchange and betting commissioner
in the country was quoting the odds
at ten to nine and even money.
The Herald very wisely, in publish
ing this Item, was careful to say
that the money was then taken
away for use somewhere else, which
leads one to believe It must have
been stage money.
Speaking of the local press, the
Courier-Journal "certainly had two
joy-killers or gloom-writers as cor
respondents telling of the political
situation, the -writer after perusing
their writings concluding that the
only way for Wilson to win was
for Hughes and Fairbanks to quit
the race.
The local campaign will close to
night with a big rally at the Strand
Theater preceded by an automobile
parade. The speaker of the even
ing will be Attorney General
Thomas Watt Gregory, while ad
dresses will be made by Congress
man Swagar Sherley and James F.
Edwards, the Democratic Elector
for this district. Chairman Frank
McGrath and his associates on the
Democratic committee have worked
unceasingly to give President Wil
son and Congressman Sherloy a sub
stantial endorsement in this district
and all predictions point to tho fact
that their labors tvIH be rewarded
Tuesday. Kentucky should give
Wilson 20,000 majority, while this
district will give 4,500 of that num
ber. CARDINAL'S APPEAL.
Cardinal Gibbons has issued an
earnest appeal to Catholic people to
contribute this year as generously
as they can to the Catholic Uni
versity collection, so that a reason
able Increase may bo obtained
which will help to meet the large
and growing expenses of the uni
versity. The collection will be
taken up on the first Sunday in
Advent. In concluding his appeal
the Cardinal says:
"Because of tho Increase of ex
penses for new buildings, new de
partments, new and costly equip
ment, the university needs badly an
Increase-of .about. onethird-,Ja-the
annual collection. May God bless
and prosper all who will take to
heart the needs of our chief Cath
olic educational Institution, of
which we are now so justly proud.
A very little enlargement of their
contributions by every diocese in
the country would encourage
greatly the administration of the
university, would benefit Imme
diately every student, and would
enable Us to undertake very soon
Important improvements that are
now sadly needed, and which would
materially Increase tho capacity of
all our departments. This would
place the Catholic University on tho
very highest level In all that con
stitutes a great modern school, per
fectly equipped for all reasonable
demands of our own time. May
God bless every generous giver to
this holy work!"
HOLY NA3IE SMOKER.
The musicale and smoker given
by tho Holy Name Society of St.
Louis Bertrand's church Tuesday
evening In Bertrand Hall proved a
most enjoyable nffair 'to the large
attendance of men present. Attor
eny W. Overton Harris delivered an
address on his experience during
the recept naval cruise of the civ
ilians. Mr. Harris was assigned to
the battleship Louisiana for three
weeks and he gave his hparers a de
tailed and descriptive account of all
that transpired during that time.
His talk was exceedingly interesting
and his audience listened with rapt
attention through his entire ad
dress, and at the close tho thanks
of the society was extended to him
through Rev. Father R. G. Lyons,
the chaplain. Preceding Mr. Har
ris address a vocal solo was ren
dered by Miss Nellie Conkllng, and
following the address a medley of
Irish dances was given by Martin
Sheehan, accompanied by Michael
Sheehan on an accordion, this feat
ure being much enjoyed. Patrick
Burke portrayed some lively jig
steps, accompanying Mr. Sheehan.
Mike Welsh made his usual big hit
with singing of Irish ballads and
Sergeant Tom FItzgibbons, one of
the new Holy Name members,
brought down tho house with his
rendition of an Irish popular song.
LOOK AFTER POOR.
Since tho aim of tho St. Vincent
de Paul Society Is to look after
the wants of the poor and render
aid wherever possible, everybody
should endeavor to be an auxiliary
member, if not an active member.
The sudden and severe changes ex
perienced already In the season
gives assurance that we are to have
a long and hard winter. If one
can not render aid In one way ho
may In another. Not even' one
may be able to open hrs purse' and
drop a coin for the causo; but there
may be an old garment in the
cloest at home, a bed or mattress
upstairs In the attic that would
help out greatly In a poverty
stricken home. Ask some of your
friends to unite with you In help
ing the St. Vincent de Paul Society.
Our Lord promises that even a glass
of cold water given In his name
shall not go unrewarded. If you
can do nothing more, at least say
a good word for the St. Vincent de
Paul Society.
EXPLOITED
IIoyv Job Selling Is Conducted in
Industrial Establishments
of Ohio.
Grasping Foremen Have Been
Mulitirig Innocent Employes .
For Years.
Drastic Measures Taken to Pun
ish Those Who Violate
Trust.
PUBLIC HAS INTEREST IN MATTER
Job selling involves the practice
of paying to the foremen in Indus
trial plants a fee for securing work
and also of paying money to tho
foremen from time to time in order
that the workman may not lose his
Job or may receive moro desirablo
work. The first complaint of this
3ort of graft on the part of tho
foremen came to the Department of
Investigation and Statistics of the
Ohio Industrial Commission through
the demands of a body of striking
employes in the latter part of 1915.
One of the demands of these strik
ers was for the discharge of a fore
man to whom the foreign workmen
were required to contribute money
from time to time in order to hold
their jobs or to secure an advance
in wages. In response to this and
subsequent complaints an investiga
tion was Instituted, which de
veloped the fact that the collection
of fees for jobs, or assessments of
various kinds, by foremen has been
In the past few months carried on
in at least six large industrial
plants in the State employing ap
proximately 40,000 men. The in
formation collected in this connec
tion is set forth by the Ohio De
partment of Investigation and Sta
tistics. It was found that in some plants
the custom has been established for
years. With some foremen a box
of cigars or a bottle of whisky was
a sufficient "present" to secure a
job ten years ago. Then tho ap
plicant learned that money was
more acceptable, and $5 was the
usual fee for the unskilled laborer.
The applicant next learned that $2
or $3 extra would help him to get
ajob without waiting, or in other
woras it wouiu piace mm on mo
preferred list; then the price rose
to $10, and from that to $15, and
at the time the Investigations wero
begun tho fee "expected" was gen
erally $15, $20 or $25 for. a job
paying approximately twenty-five
cents per hour. The employes pay
ing these fees are almost alto
gether non-English speaking for
eigners, and those who profit from
tho fees are usually English speak
ing or able to speak English, and
quite generally of a different raco
from those who aro exploited.
The story appears to bo the same
In establishment after establishment
where special pains have not been
taken to eliminate and to prevent
exploitation. Tho evidence showed
that the shrewder foreman, occupy
ing a comparatively high position,
seldom receives the money directly
from the applicant, but usually has
a number of men who act as go
betweens. These go-betweens may
bo "straw bosses" or they may be
workmen. They are often of tho
same race as those who aro to bo
exploited. Tho applicant pays tho
money to the go-between, and he in
turn pays It to the foreman. Some
times the money passes through tho
hands of two, three or even four
persons before it reaches the fore
man. In some cases the go-between
retains a small part of the money
collected. The go-between, it seems,
performs this service practically
without pay, for two reasons: First,
tnls enables him to stand in with
his foreman, and thus to secure
more desirable work or to be re
tained during periods of depres
sion; and second, it enables him to
secure work for his friends and
countrymen, and this gives him a
certain standing in his circle of
acquaintances. On the whole the
Investigation seemed to show that
there are reasons to believe that
more or less grafting in the form
of Job selling by foremen, in col
lecting money from workmen for
retaining them during slack times,
for assigning them to more de
sirable jobs, or for Increasing their
wages, and in conducting raffles for
the benefit of tho foreman, is car
ried on to a greater or less extent
In most of the large industrial
plants where Immigrants aro em
ployed. Tho report states that in some of
the six plants mentioned very dras
tic measures have been taken to
punish those foremen who have
violated their trust and to devise
plans for preventing grafting. In
the majority of plants it Is believed
that the practice has been broken
up, "but almost a complete reor

Borne plants will be necessary be

that this graft will be permanently
