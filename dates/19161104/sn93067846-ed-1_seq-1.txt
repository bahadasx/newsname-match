New York. Oct. II.?President
liew Wlleou la going to ro re
elected. The only question now Is
hew feirgo a vote ho will muster in
the electoral cello**, this depending,
el course, upon several very doubt?
ful States.
The high water mark of the Repub?
lican campaign was reached about
month ago. This came after the
llughoa' failure In the initial
western trip, shortly after which the
Republican leaders got together and
made changes in the campaign that
had telling affect. A week after the
Ropahlloan climax, the tight belonged
to neither party so close was the bat?
tle raging. Thon?began the tide to?
ward the Wilson banner. Each day
could be felt the change until now,
on a wave of patriotism that Is sweep*
lag the country, cutting down old
time' Republican strongholds, Wilson
will be earried Into office.
Even without the powerful array of
electoral votes that New York State
ffswnJehee Wilson can win en account
of the West In spite of Cot. Roose?
velt's -excursions Into the West?and
he fa* still very popular out that way?
Wilson** gains in doubtful territory
have caused consternation In Re?
publican renke. In the far West ex?
cept for California. Hughes will not
he la the running. Illinois, one of
the great doubtful States, has shown
a steady drtf* toward Wilson In the
or three weeks. The votes of
that ?Ute wHl have great
there are up
-"tiers la R?
i bit can* have sent a great
of money Into Indiana, It is
said, aal the cry Is "anything to beat
Wilson " In Wall street here tho bet?
ting started at I to 1 In favor of
Hughes and is now at even money.
The New York Herald which has
adroitly carried on a campaign In fa?
vor Of Hughes, particularly favoring
a pratmtlve tariff, has been compell?
ed te admit thai the drift Is toward
Wilson and with the continuance of
the pfeeont nite of changes to Wil?
son. It will doubtless make definite
announcement forecasting the elec?
tion of tho president. The Herald'i
"straw ballot**' In doubtful States
have In past years accurately fore?
casted results of national and State
elections In New York City senti?
ment favors President Wilson while,
generally speaking, outside Greater
New York, the State of New York is
for Htubes. However, even In sec?
tions hitherto regarded as Republican
stronghold* the Democrats have made
dente recently that may overthrow
tradition The vote In this State will
ha close.
In the theatres here one can get a
fair Idea of sentiment because people
are gathered from every part of this
I country. It was only a few weeks ago
that the names of Wilson and Hughes
elicited about the same amount of ap
pluse. Recently, as the campaign
waxed warmer and as the appeal to
patriotism became greater, the men?
tion of the name of Woodrow Wilson
has sent the people to their feet
cheering In every Instance, while
Hughes has been able to carry hardly
more than a good sprinkling of ap?
plause.
Poop's are resenting tho bitter at?
tacks on the president and trie bitter?
est of these have been madn by men
high up In itepubllcan ranks. For
example, the speech former President
Roosevelt made today in Brooklyn
was about the bitterest utterance
made so far on the stump In this
campaign.
With the vote running close in sev?
eral of the doubtful States, there are
bound to be certain surprises. How?
ever, si moat any way It la figured out
Wilson appears the winner.

telegram follows:
"In reply to your telegram let me
say tint tho statement made by Sena?
tor Lodge Is untruo. No postscript
or amendment of the Lusltania note
was over written or contemplated by
me except such change that I myself
Inserted which strengthened and em?
phasised the protest. It was suggested
after the note was ready for transmis?
sion ;hat an Intimation be conveyed
to the German government that a pro
I posal for arbitration would be ac?
ceptable, and one member of cabinet
spoke to me about It but It was never
discussed in cabinet mooting and no
throat of any resignation was ever
made for the vary good reason that
I rejected the suggestion after giving
It such consideration as I thought

BRYAN DENIES STORY.
Omaha. Oct. 30.?William j. Bryan
former secretary of state, denied here
that there was any truth In the story
that a postcript hsd been written to
the Lusltania note advising the Ger?
man government that the strong lan?
guage of the note should not be taken
seriously and that later the postscilp
was withdrawn.
"1 take It for granted," Mr. Bryan
ild, "that the president will deal with
the matter as he deems wise, If Indeed
any attention need be paid It after
Mr. Becklnrldge's denial."
Mr. Bryan would make no more
comment except to call attention to
the fact that hla resignation was not
tendeied at the time the first Lusltania
note, to which the alleged postcript
was attached, was written, but at the
time the seoond note was written,
which was nearly a month later.
Mr. Bryan said he had received
many telegrams from Eastern news?
papers und politicians askinrr him to
confirm or deny the statements of
Senator Lodge in regard to the post?
script to the Lusltania note. All these
telegrams were ignored, he said. After
his brief statement, Mr. Bryan re?
fused further to discuss the Lusltania
postcript incident.

As a result of the adoption of this

against interlocking boards. The Clay?

in event of its violation, as understood
here, but specifics certain procedures
by which interlocking directors may
be removed, and if these directors are
reinstated they then become liable to
punishment by the courts.

NORMAL DEMOCRATIC MAJOR?
ITY IS 50,000 IN PRESIDEN?
TIAL ELECTIONS.
Many Democrats Usually Fail to <?o
to Polls in (.enoral Election?Ef?
forts Made to Get Them out This
Year and Vote is Expected to tie
Larger.
Columbia, Oct. 30.?The normal
Democratic majority in South Caro?
lina In presidential election years is
$50,000, which means about all of the
vote, for not over half of the voters
go to the polls. Four years SgO
President Wilson received 48,357
votes, Col. Roosevelt 1.293 and Mr.
Taft 53ti. The Democratic State
ticket, which was headed that year
by Cole L. Blease for governor, re?
ceived 44,122 votes to 208 for the So?
cialist ticket, that being the only op?
position to the Democrats in the State
election.
In the Democratic primary of 1912
when Cole L. Dlease was renominated
for governor over Ira B. Jones by a
majority of 6,000, there were 140,OuO
votes polled, so that over 90,000 Dem?
ocrats failed to go to the polls In the
general election. This condition has
existed for a number of years because
of the lack of opposition to the Dem?
ocratic ticket and Its certainty of win?
ning. .
This year, however, the situation is
different and indications are that the
vote in the general election will be
heavy. There are five electoral tickets
in the Held, the Democratic, Socialist,
Progressive and two Republican
tickets, in the bid for the presidential
vote. Then the Democratic State
ticket is opposed by the candidates
for the Progressive nomination for
governor and lieutenant governor,
and by the Socialist State ticket.
On top of all this opposition it is
said that tickets are being distributed
for an independent vote, a
the Demeoratic nominee f<
r, Richard I. Manning.
inrai
that they are being handed _aj/j* many
counties. A gentleman from the up
country who was in the city today,
said they were being given out in
many parts of the Piedmont.
The persistent and continued talk
of "bolting" caused State Chairman
John Gary Evans to issue this morn?
ing his warning to the Democrats to
go to the polls and vote the straight
ticket from president down to the
county offices. He warned the Demo?
crats to be on their guard and to turn
out in force and roll up such a ma?
jority for the State and national tick?
ets as to make certain of not defeat?
ing the choice of the people as ex?
pressed in the primaries this year.
The warning caused considerable in?
terest in the State and it was tho
subject of comment here this morning
by visitors who were in town from
different sections. There are plenty
of indicaitons that the voters are be?
coming aroused and intend to go to
the polls on next Tuesday.
The general election is one Wank
from tomorrow, the 7th of November.
To vote in the election requires regis?
tration certificate and tax receipts fcr
1915.
The Democratic leaders believe that
'the State and national tickets can re?
ceive a majority of 100,000 in South
Carolina if the people will only turn
out to the polls, and they urge that
this he done this year as it has not
been done in years before. Not only
will this make certain of the election
of the State ticket and the carrying
of the State for President Wilson, but
it will have, they declare, a good ef?
fect in the North, where a bitter fight
is being waged against the president
because of the large number of South?
erners who are heads of the important
committees in congress. While there
has been no talk in recent years of
a "force" bill this is liable to bob up
again should the nation he carried by
the Republicans for they are quick to
point out the small vote in the South
in tho general election.
There has been unusual activity
among the Republicans in this State
this year and unless the Democrats
wake up and go to the polls somebody
may have rogTOtfl when the election is
over, as was said here today.
Governor Manning will hold a con?
ference with a committee of fire in?
surance men on Wednesday in connec?
tion with resolutions which they will
present to him concerning some pin a
for the situation brought ahont by th
anti-compact law causing the Insur?
ance companies to withdraw from tin
