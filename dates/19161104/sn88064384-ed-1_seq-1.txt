Amazingly Comfortable
They like its power—it's the world's
most powerful low priced car.
Everybody concedes its beauty.
It wins on economy.
But its roomy seats, deep upholstery
and easy riding cantilever springs—
These things make it so amazingly
comfortable that people can hardly
believe their senses.
You wouldn't think that a small, light,
economical, low priced car could be
so comfortable.
But come in and let us prove it to you.
