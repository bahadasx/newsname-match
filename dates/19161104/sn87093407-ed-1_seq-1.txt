vJ VOLUNTEERS NEEDED TO CIRCULATE NONPARTISAN ELECTION PETITIONS AT THE POLLS TUESDAY! Petitions for
this great measure, which will remove the blindness of partisanship in state and county elections, as well as in the city, will be ready for
circulation Monday. Call at Nonpartisan headquarters, 3107 Arcade Annex, Second ave., between Union and University sts., and
volunteer your services for election day. There are 416 precincts in the county. At least 416 volunteers are needed. Ihe telephone number is Elliott 4255. Remember
that in the primary election in September you were compelled to tell whether you are a republican, democrat, progressive, socialist, before you were permitted to vote.
This bill will eliminate this undesirable condition. We elect our city officials and judges without party labels. Why not also county and state officials?

MAKING FORECAST
WASHINGTON, D. C, Nov. 4. —After six week
of travel from San Diego to Boston, and continuous
Jtudy of the political situation in every important state.
1 can see nothing but a democratic landslide.
I believe Wilson can win without New York, but.
is likely to have New York. Leaving New York out'
of the equation, 1 think Wilson's success is assured by
the electoral votes of the following states:
The solid South, certain: Alabama, 12; Arizona, V
Arkansas, Florida, 6; Georgia, 14; Kentucky, 13;
Louisiana, 10; Maryland, 8; Mississippi, 10; Missouri.
18; North Carolina, 12; Oklahoma, 10; South Carolina,
0; Tennessee, 12; Texas, 20; Virginia, 12; total, 17«.
Others reasonably certain for Wilson: California, !
13; Colorado, 6; Idaho, 4; Illinois, 20; Indiana, 15;
Michigan, 15; Minnesota, 12; Montana, 4; Nebraska, 8;
Nevada, 3; North Dakota, S; Ohio, 24; Oregon, 5; South
Dakota, 5; Utah. 4; Washington, 7; Wisconsin, 13;
Wyoming, 3; total, 175.
The sum of these groups would give Wilson 353
electoral votes, which is 87 more than the 266 neces
sary to a choice.
With *uch a margin. Wilton

LONE SURVIVOR
IBIS TRAGEDY
OF HURRICANE
LONDON, Nov. 4.—From 90 to 100 per
sons perished when the steamer Connemara,
of the London & Northwestern Co., collided
with the steamer Retriever during a storm
off Carlingford Lough last night, according
to latest estimates.
It was first feared that upward of 300
lives had been lost. Only one survivor was
accounted for. A check of the number of
passengers and crews carried by the vessels
lowered the estimate of the casualty list.
The Connemara carried 51 passengers
and a crew of 30. The Retriever's crew
numbered 13. It is not definitely known
whether passengers were aboard the Re
triever but revised figures put the total num
ber on the two ships at not more than 100.
A man named Boyle, a member
(of the Retriever's crew, miracu
lously escaped death. He brought
back the story of the greatest sea
disaster since the sinking of the
: Lusitanla. and prevented the dis
appearance of the two ships with
their passengers and crews from
becoming an untold sea mystery.
Collide in Hurricane
Only fragmentary reports of the
disaster had reachfd to
i!ay. FYom these accounts it ap
pears that the Connemara left
(Jreenore, Ireland, about dusk yes-
terdav evening for Holly head. Eng..
and collided with the Inward bound
steamer Retriever a few miles off
I the Irish coast.
The Connemara was carrying 51
passengers. So far as known here
not one of them was an American.
leaving Oreenore, the ferry
steamer ran into the tip of a vi
olent hurricane.
Plunging along thru the dark
ness and storm, with even greater
difficulty, the smaller Retriever,
inbound for her home port of
Newry, In Carlln gford l<ough.
crashed into the Connemara.
Couldn't Launch Boats
Apparently few of the Oonne
maras passengers had retired
when the collision occurred. Crews
of both steamers apparently tried
to launch the boats.
Seaport towns near the scene of
the disaster reported the sea toss
ing so violently last night that it
was doubtful if a single boat was
gotten over by either steamer. It
