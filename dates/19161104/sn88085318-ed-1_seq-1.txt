HUGHES UNMASKB.
The eat is out of the bag. The
progressive mask is off. The
pretense of liberalism is aban
doned. Pussyfooting has slipped^
n cog and perfect candor has
come to the front. Mr. Hughe*
hns revealed his hand at last.
In a recent speech he made this
astounding statement:
"The whole democratic legisla
tive accomplishment must be
wiped off the books for the good
of the country."
Pause for a moment and con
sider what that means. If it
means anything at all it means
that Charles B. Hughes aligns
himself definitely on the side of
the reactionaries and standpat
ters. It means that he ropudi
ates progress and social justice.
It means back to the halcyon days
of Mark Hannaism with the
trusts and the powerful money
interests of the country running
the government to suit them
selves. It means a definite and
absolute abandonment of all the
principles of the progressive par
ty, most of which have been en
acted into law during the admin
istration of President Wilson. It
means that Charles E. Hughes
stands for plutocracy as against
the people.
If the whole democratic legis
lative achievement must be wiped
oft' the statute books, as Mr.
Hughes declares, tariff reform as;
carried out by the Underwood
bill must be abandoned and a new
measure written that, presumably
will be an even greater outrage
upon the people than the Payne-
Aldrich iniquity that wrecked the
Taft administration.
The income tax laws will have
to be repealed and the burden
which the democratic party lifted
from the shoulders of the peoproi
put back on those least able to
pay.
The Federal Reserve Banking
act will have to go, and the old
era of periodical panics be re
established in order that; Wall
street may have fat pickings.
The Child Labor and Work
men's Compensation laws must be
repealed, of course. It is the
"whole" democratic legislative
accomplishment that Mr. Hughes
says must go.
The Rural Credits measure
must die an early death and the
helping hand which the govern
ment is extending to the farmers
of the country, enabling them to
be put on the same credit footing
as other business men, must be
withdrawn.
The Merchant Marine bill, the
Kon-Partisan Tariff Commission,
and the score of other great con
struetivo and beneficial measures
enacted within the last three
years, including of course the
Eight-Hour day bill, are marked
for death if Mr. Hughes is elected
president. He says so himself in
one sweeping indictment, and we
assume that he means what he
says. If he doesn't mean what
he says in this instance, he is not
to be trusted in anything that he
does say, and is unworthy of the
office to which he aspires because
he is trying to obtain it by mean
ingless phrases and false pre
tenses.
We are glad to have .Mr. Hughes
definitely on record at last. He
is against lithe whole democratic
legislative accomplishment,"
which means that he is against
progress, justice and the public
welfare. If elected, his whole
term of office will he devoted to
undoing what has been accom
plished for the people by the Wil
son administration. If the peo
ple of the United States want to
step back instead of going for
ward they know how to accom
plish that result. Mr. Hughes
has promised to stop the wheels
of progress if they will elect him
pretident.
WOODROW WILSON.
Miles Poindexter, republican
candidate tor senator, and Thomas
Corkery, republican candidate for
congress, both assert that they are
strong supporters of Hughes,
hence a vote for them will aid to
bring back the old days of bank
panics, tariff for the trusts, high
rates of interest for the farmers,
and mi legislation for the work
ingman,
On the contrary, Congressman
('. (.'. Dill advocates a continuance
of the democratic kind of progres
sive legislation, and indorses the
work which has been done.
The ordinary citizen has noth
ing to gain by supporting the
party controlled by Barnes, Pen
rose, Smoot, Cannon and Wall
street, but he has somthing to gain
hy supporting that leader of
Americans, Woodrow Wilson, and
those men who want to be sent
from this state to support him—
Senator Turner and Congressman
'.Dill.

WILSON WANTS DILL
Hon. Frank Funkhouser, Con
gressman Dill's campaign man
ager, Spokane, Wash.
May I not express the hope that
the prospects are for the re-elec
tion of Mr. Dill to congress. I
hope sincerely that there can be
no doubt of. his return. His sup
port of the administration has cer
tainly won for him the favor of
all those who believe in progres
sive government.

ELECTION RESULTS.
With the general election three
days ahead lioth political parties
are claiming everything in sight.
For years it has been usual for
party leaders to make claims of
success, with the idea perhaps of
strengthening the weak hearts of
their followers. This year is no
exception, and the most radical
claims are being made.
The Examiner is not a prophet,
does not predict offers no advice
to voters, and tries to remain in
the ranks of legitimate newspap
"h in giving the possibilities of
next Tuesday's election. The fol
lowing statements are compiled
from what people an; saying, and
what people are actually doing.
Betting in Spokane is "1 to 1
mi Wilson, and considerable .sums
have been offered t'<<r weeks on
Wilson that have not been taken.
Betting is active thai Washington
will go for Wilson, one bei being
made that this state will go for
Wilson 15,000. Other bets are
that Wilson carries this state by
7,()(M), that lie carries Spokane
inty by 3,000. 25 to 20 that Dill
is reelected. Several bets favor
ing Poindexter were not taken.
Me Bride was the favorite in the
betting on governor. A $.">oo bei
on Wilson was posted in Colville
Monday and was finally taken by
a Dumber of Hughes supporters.
King county, with one-fourth of
the state's vote, and Spokane
county ar needed to Wilson.
All the straw ballots that have
been taken by responsible papers
and organizations report in favor
6i Wilson. The New York ll.t
-ald, Spokesman-Review, Spokane
Chronicle, and Literary Digest
straw ballots all showed for Wil
son. The straw vote obtained by
the Rexall stores of the country
showed for Wilson. Even in Col
ville, the Petty straw vole was
for Wilson. It. is admitted thai
Wilson can win without the vote
of New York, which is said to h«
doubtful.
The estimates for Stevens coun
ty seem to show Ili;it Wilson will
lead the democratic ticket, with
,i plurality in this county of 600
to 1.000 Dill is scheduled to
carry this county by 600 to 800,
Lister by 500 to 700. The vole
on I. S. senator is so mixed thai
predictions are impossible. Poin
dexter lias always had many
friends in this county, in all par
ties, Imt the old line republicans
are refusing to support him and
Corkery because they helped to
defeat the republican party pre
viously.
The conteal for governor is re
volving around the wet and dry
question. It seems that not a wet
sympathizer in the state is sup
porting Lister, and very few
dries are supporting Mcßride.
The two Liquor amendments seem
destined •'• receive a much great
er support in this county than has
been, thought, and the supporters
of these measures are asking that
MeKride Ite supported for gover
nor. Numerous people who are
presumed to he dry, having found
the prohibition law a little more
strenuous than expected, are now
in favor of the beer bill, and say
ing little are supporting this one
amendment, and Meßride, in the
hope of h slight change in condi
tions, but without, actually bring
ing back the saloons. Nearly all
candidates on all tickets have
been talking against this amend
ment, but there is a startling uni
formity in the way republicans
and democrats who favor the
;imeiidmy.'iil, also favor Mcßride
for the executive should the meas
ure be passed, ft is evident that
this election is the last stand for
the liquor forces, and that if they
can not win this time, they will
have no future hopes.
For months tin- (lerninn vote of
the country has bMB classed as a
