CARRIERE GUILTY
AS CHARGED
Slayer of Sheriff Marion Swords Must Pay
With His Life For Crime lie
Was Charged With.
The "twelve good men and true"
who was chosen to decide the fate of
Hilaire Carriere, the man charged
with the murder of Sheriff Marion
L. Swords, after six and a half hours
of deliberation, at first unable to
agree, were ordered to belock up
until monday morning, brought in
the verdict at 11:35 o'clock Satur
day night of "GUILTY AS CHARG
ED IN THE BILL OF ENDICT
MENT" which means capital pun
ishment-DEATH.
When the large courthouse bell
tolled, the news spread quickly over
the entire city that the jury had ar
rived at a verdict. In the space of
a few minutes the courthouse was
filled with spectators who were an
xious to know the fate of the prison
er who was charged with one of
the most diabolical crime ever
comitted in this parish. Although
it was the consensus of opinion that
if a verdict had been arrived at in
so short a time, that Hilaire Car
riere was a doomed man.
The prisoner was conducted into
the courtroom walking erect and
unmoved and upon assuming his
seat, as the twelve serious men were
taking their seats, he looked into the
eyes of every man on the jury, but
saw no signs of consolation come
back; all in seriousness the court
was informed of the verdict and
one by one the twelve tired and true
men answered to their names as
well as to their verdict.
Thus ended one of the most noted
criminal cases ever tried in the par
ish of St. Landry. Very few cases
ever attracted so much attention as
did this trial. The town has been
crowded since the beginning of the
trial, and the capacity of the court
room was taxed to accomodate the
spectators. The visitors included
prominent parish offidials from
every section of the state who were
attracted here by a desire to see
Carriere.
The slaying of Sheriff Swords is
regarded as one of the most hartless
crimes in the history of the state
as was proven by the failure of the
defense to bring out any ,reason
whatsoever justifying Carriere to
comit such an attrocious crime. In
its arguement before the jury the
defense laid great stress upon the
fact the Sheriff had taken negroes
along to assist in the arrest of a
* white man , which was fitly answer
eA by the state with the evidence
that the accused lived amoung ne
groes , associated with them almost
entirely and was found in the home
of the negro woman the morning
of the killing.
During all the proceedings Judge
Pavy 'ruled with a iron hand
drawing favorable comment from
all sides. Upon final discharging
the jury, he highly compliment the
twelve men, as being the best
conducted and fairest jury that
ever sat in the parish of St. Landry.
Sentence will be passed on Nov. 4th.
ThIursday morningl
The witness, Durousseau, brought
the note from St. Andre to Sheriff
Swords on Sunday prior to the kill
ing, which stated where Carriere
could be found that night. He saw
Carriere frequently previous to the
crime and said 'he was always armed
He was given an automatic re
v0lver on the night of the killing,
but never shot it, he said. He went
in the cornfield when instructed by
Swords to get Carriere out. Car
8-riere shot him at a distance of some
six steps. That shot was the last he
heard. At that time he was only
twelve or fifteen yards from Deputy
Chachere and after being shot
'staggered to Chachere exclaimed,
"I'm shot to deat"h."
His story largely coroburates
of St. Andre and Chachere
.t W.the details of the fight and
given in a sincere manner.
The defence made a brake, it was
btought on cross-examination by
ringing out that the reason the
'eriff had negros on his posse was
.tt there were hardly any white
ple in the neighborhood but Car
8's relatives. This was Dlu
taseau's first time in court, but
the defense was unable to shake
his tetimony.
Armand Manuel, called on yester
day and temporarily excused, testi
fied as to Carriere's threats some
four weeks beforethe crime, that he
would fight to death anyone at
tempting to arrest him. Carriere
was heavily armed at the time. The
-defense objected to the testimony
and the court overruled.
Court adjourned at 12:45 p. m. to3
p. m.
The first afternoon witness was
Armas Manual, who was with the
preceding Witness when Carriere
made his threats. His testimony
was corroborative. Counsel had
long arguement as to admissability
or the testimony and the jury was
retired. The court overruled de
fense objections and was very
evidently becoming impatient at the
alleged qubbling and dilatry tatics
of defense
Dr. R. M. Littell, coroner and act
ing sheriff in the interim preceding
the election of Sherig Fontenot, be
ing recalled, testified as to examina
tion of the wounds of the mulat
toes, Brunot St. Andre and Durous
seau, and that the wounds indicat
ed they were made by same caliber
bullet as that which caused the
death of Swords.
He further tetified to a visit to
the Lake Charles jail and with a talk
with Carriere on the day after he
was captured
Carriere told 'him he was sorry he
had killed the sheriff, who'had acted
as a father to him and he would not
have done so but for the presence
of the negros . Defense objected to
the testimony and was overruled.
Sheriff Latiolais of Lafayette
,parish corroborated Dr. Littell as
to Carriere's statement. He had
spent some twenty-five days hunt
ing Carriere after the crime in three
of four parishes. Attorney Perrin
continually objected apd the court
stated he did not believe counsel is
is serious and requested him to stop
quibbling and try to conduct a legal
trial.
Perrin asked the witness if he is
not a "smart Aleck" and Sheriff
Latiolais replied, "I am, at least, as
smart as you are sir".
William St. Andre's testinmony was
not important, bearing on facts that
Carriere was always armed and on
the lookout for" the officers.
J. M. Sanders, one of St. Landry's
representatives, and his son, Wal
ter, testified to passing near the
scene of the crime some three weeks
before its occurence,' in an auto
mobile, which had much the ap
pearance of Sherix Swords' car.
They sami and recognized Carriere,
who first dodged behind a tree and
then came out with rifle presented.
Carriere cocked the gun and kept
the car covered until it had passed
by.
Miss Gladys Swords, niece of the
slain sheriff, testified that her uncle
told her of receiving a note from St.
Andre on the Sunday before the
killiqg au after thr.t found the note
in the pocket of trousers the sheriff
had taken off.
Sheriff D. M. Fontenot was recall
ed and testified as to a talk with
Carriere in the Lake Clarles jail
on the day after his capture in
which he made statements similar
to those made to Dr. Littell and
Sheriff Latiolais, that he had killed
Swords because he brought negroes
with him.
Dr. Met'rjck W. Swords of New
Orleans, eldest son of the deceased
sheriff, proved a strong state wit
ness. He also visited Carriere in the
Lake Charles jail: "'Why did you
kill my father?"
"I would not have done so had it
not been for the negroes."
He had himown Carriere previous
to the killing. Carriere called him
to his bedside and pointed out on a
piece of paper the relative-position
of the sheriff and himself when he
shot him. He was only fifteen or
twenty yards away from the sheriff
Thle smoke of his rifle blinded him
and he could not see just how thhe
shreitTff fell, but heard him grunt,
"Ugh!".
The state then rested its case at
5:05 p. m. and court recessed till
8 p.m.
The state appeared to have made
out an iron-clad case, it is claimed
here, and an unquilified verdict of
guilty is confidently predicted by
spectators. Defense counsel do not
seem to have strengthened their
case with the jury or court by con
stant objections and alleged nagging
of witnesses.
The three mulattoes St. Andre
Ledet and Durousseau, made splen
did witnesses for the state. St..
Andre in particular is very intelli
gent. All appear to have strong
traces of Indian blood.
When court convened at 8 p. m.
every inch of bench and floor space
in the courthouse was massed with
serious, quiet men from the four
corners of the parish, except that
the aisles were kept clean. The
doors were closed to prevent further
crowding. The defense put Carriere
on the-stand.
Attorney Perrin asked him if on
the 17th day of July he killed Sheric
Swords. He answered.
"I did not."
"Asked if on emerging from the
cabin that morning anyone told him
to "Halt," he answered, "No"
The defense tendered the witness
and the state asked no auestions.
Counsel for the defense asked de
lay because certain witness were not
present. Investigation showed the
defense never asked they be sub
poenaed. The defense appeared
about to break into fiasco and the
the court strongly intimated that if
any defence witnesses were not
present it was the fault of the de
fense, and or -dered the trial to pro
ceed.
Ella Fontenot, a bright, rateher
pretty copper-colored mulato girl,
and claimed to be Carriere's "Wo
man" a dweller in the "murder
cabin" was brought from the jail
bedecked with a bead necklace,
rings and hair ornaments. Her only
tesLimbny was disappointing to the
defense, being to the effect that
she was awakened on the morning
of the murder by the shots and
therefoore did not know whether
any one called "Halt" on not.
Diar Fontenot, mother of Ella
the same testimony.
Paul Miller and son, Arthur, were
called to impeach the testimony of
Brunot St. Andre and Severin Le
det. Their testimony had no ma
terial bearing.
Babe Courville had hnown Car
riere twenty years, but that was the
extent of his defense testimony.
Attorney Obier and Parrin, of the
defense counsel, took the stand and
testified they visited the scene of
the crime and talked to certain of
the witnesses, but tJieir evidence did
not contradict state witness on any
of importance.
The defense rested at. 9:25 p. m.
At 9:20 District. Attorney Garland
breifly stated the state's case, but
reserved his main argument, for
closing . He stated Sheriff Swords
personfied the law when killed, and
around him and his deputies was
thrown the sheild ofthe law in per
formance of their duties; that in
the nature of the case there could
be no qualified verdict, He finished
his argument at9:35 and Prentiss
Obier opened the defense cas2. He
spoke for twenty-five minutes.
Robert W. GCreene followed for
tihe defense. He is originally from
Vermillion parish. In the course of
argument he became poetical.
David R. Rosethal, of Lake Charles
occupied thirty minutes of time in
his talk for Carriere.
L. Austain Fontenot, of the state
counsel, said he appeared as the
personal representative of the
widow and children of sheriff
Swords and made a very strong ar
gument for the defense. He resent
ed the attempt of the defense coun
sel to inject the negro question in
to the case, recalled the testimony
of talesmen that Swords was"every
body's friend," and fair to both
white and negro. He pleaded for
an unqualified ver4ict.
Mrs. Perrin talked in low tone of
INDEMINTY ASKED
FROM 5UATEMALA
IN LEFLEUR CASE
CLAIM ARISING FROM DEATH OF
LOUISIANIAN WILL BE FOR
WARDED SOON.
Washington, D. C., Oct. 27.-A claim
for indemnity for the death of Dr.
Moise Lefleur, of Opelousas, will be
forwarded to the Guatemaila gov
ernment by the State Department
within the next few days. Dr. Le
fleur met his death lastspring at
the hands of Guatemalan soldiers
who fired on the party of which he
was a member in the belief that it
was a band of revolutionists. The
party had benn sent out by the
Smithsonian Institute. On learing
of the error of its soilders, the Gga
temalan government made formal
expression,of regret to this govern
ment.
Before submitting any claim for
indemnity, the state department in
sisted that all possible proof to
sustain its position be collected. It
is the policy of the department to
have its contention supported by
all available evidence before mak
ing a claim. As the evidence was
scattered and difficulty to obtain,
considerable delay has resulted.
Representative Lazaro was able
however, to collect the last affi
davits needed, and presented them
at t'he State Department to-day. `
The exact amount of indemnity
which will be asked has not been
determined upon as yet. In similar
cases indeymnity vary from $3000 to
$20,000 has been asked. This has
varied with the conditions sur
rounding each case. In view of the
fact that Dr. Lefleur was making
scientific investigations under a
special permit issued by tae Gua
temalan government an indemnnity
of $20,000 or even more may be ask
ed. Dr. E. Lefleur, of Opelousas, a
brother of the slain man, is making
the claim in the interest of the re
latives.- Times-Picayune.

voice to the jury for some five
minutes, stressing the legal aspect
of malice aforethought.
At 11:45 Thomas Perrin began the
final defense argument. He did not
ask the jury to acquit Carriere, but
to qualify their verdict. He al
though at one time a district at
torney, did not believe in capital
punishment and read from the Holy
Scripture to the jury. He attempt
ed to cast aspersion on the testi-.
mony of Charles Chachere, deputy
sheriff and that of Sheriff Reid,
Fontenot, and Latiolais. He claim
ed to have been a friend of the slain
sheriff. His exertions in argument
,had tried him out by 13:30 and court
adjourned until 2:30.
Attorney Perrin resumed and oc
cupied another hour during the
afternoon.
District Attorney Garland arose
to close the state'sargument.at 3:25
p. m. During the next hour he made
what is generally acknowledge to
have been the greatest argument of
his twenty yearss' experience as a
district attorney. His arrainment of
Carriere was vitriolic and power
ful. St. Landry's historic seat of
justice probably never heard a more
powerful appleal to a jury. He tore
iopieces the arguments of the de
fense counsel and testimony of the
defense witnesses . His duty in the
instant case was to demand the
law's severest penalty and the duty
or the jury was to inflict same. He
said that the defense counsel"hold
up nursery hobgobblins" to the ju
rors, and pleaded that they give Car
riere only what he gave Swords.
A spectator called out, That
right."
He said there could be no religious
social or political difference of
opinion among honest men in such
cases. He finally pleaded for no
"milk and water" verdict against
"the man who stilled the great
heart of Marion Swords",
Judge Pavy gave an elaborate
charge to th ejury which was con
sidered by attorneys as most fair
to both the state and defense, oc
cupying twenty-five minutes. The
jury retired at 5:15 p. m.
Carrirere laughed and joked with
his counsel, officials and reporters.
Asked what verdict he expected,
he answered, "Hanging," but added
would not be the end of the case.
M.ELVILLE CELEBRATES
"JEFFERSON HIGHWAY"
MR. CLARKSON ARRIVES IN THE PATHFINDING CAR AND HEADS
DIG PARADE-250 SCHOOL CHILDREN MARCH CHEER
ING AND WAVING FL AGS AND BANNERS
Representing St. Landry Paris"a in
her fight to secure the Jefferson
Highway, Melville added to the glory
of the Empire parish of the state
by tendering to the Pathfinding
party a reception that did a great
deal towards impressing upon Mr.
J. D. Clarks, general manager, of
the Highway Association, the
superior benefits St. Landry enjoys
as a link in this great International
Highway extending from the pines
of Canada to the palms of Louisiana.
On Monday morning a party from
Melville met Mr. Clarkson at Port
Allen and escorted him from that
point through Rosedale, Maringoin,
Fordoche and Red Cross to the At
chafalaya river.. At eachi of thses
points breif stops were made and
the benefit of the Highway as a
commercial proposition demonstrat
ed to the residencts of these com
munities.
As the Pathfinding car was being
ferried across the Atachafalaya
river, the Melville high school with
two hundred and fifty children in
line with flags and banners began
marching and counter marching on
the levee to the accompaniment of
the whistles and bells of the city.
Business was susperided and the
citizens met the distinguished party
at the river where a parade was
formed, escorting the visitors to a
banquet in honor of Mr. Clarkson.
Mr. Clarkson, after the banquet de
livered a splendid address on the
value of the Highway, the vest bene
fits that would accrue to the pari~h
of St. Landry by being included onr
its right-of-way, as proven by the
experience of other communities
now located on the Jefferson High
way.
Mayor C. W. Stone presided over
the meeting and pointed out in a
breif talk the necessity of this
parish securing the highway.

LYCEUM COURSE
The Opelousas School improve
ment League was very fortunate in
presenting the Cosmopolitan Ladies'
Quartette as the opening number of
the Lyceum Course which has been
secured for this season.
This attraction was presented at
the High School auditorium on
Saturday Oct. 28th. There will be
four other numbers, all highly
recommended. It can be said that
tie Cosmopolitan Ladies' Quartette
is one of the most versatile and
finished lady organizations in the
Lyceum and Chauttaqua fields. The
Company comprises a singing
quartette, a saxaphone quartette,
and a four piece orchestra,
conisting of vilon, flute, piano, and
saxaphone. The major portion of the
ensemble work was singing, but
there were other numbers which
-made the entire evening a delightful
one.
Everybody in the assembly
enjoyed the evening, and it is the
tion and proposition of this great
International Highway way launch
ed in New Orleans in November 1915
In less than a years time the move
ment has assured proposition that
bid fair to be a completed project
within six months and entirely hard
surfaced from Winnipeg, Manitoba,
to New Orleans, by 1921.
The Highway extends over a dis
tance of two thousand miles and
from Winnipeg to Rapides parish
the route has been decided upon
and marked with the colors and
monogram of the "Jefferson High
way".
After leaving Alexandria two
routes to Port Allen are contending
for the honors of the highway, one
to Bunkie, through Morrow, Palmet
to, Melville, thence across the At
chafalaya river. The other route
follows Red rive to Marksville,
Simmesport, New Roads and Port
Allen. The later route eliminates
the Parish of St. Landry entirely
from the Jefferson Highway but on
the Melville route twenty seven
miles of St. Landry Parish is
traversed by this International
Highway which, in its course from
north to south bisects the seven
great east and west Highways of
the United States.
On the completed Jefferson High
way the average number of auto
mobiles passing through a town in
one day amounts to one hundred,
and Melville realizes that a quicker
means of crossing the Atchafalaya
River than by ferry will facilitate
traffic, - so with her clharacteristic
energy Melville has immediately be
gun to solve the problum of a traf
fic bridge over the river. The
Texas & Pacific Railroad have been
requesed to attend a meeting of the
Melville Progressive League,.' and
discuss the feasibility of connect
ing a traffic bridge with the Texas
& Pacific Railroad bridge.
MAY OPEN NEW
PICTURE SHOW
The lower portion of the Elks Home
may be transforihn.d into
A Picture Show.
That Opelousas will soon have
three motion picture shows is the
announcement made here to-day.
For good and sufficient reasons it
is proposed to conseal the identy of
the promotor until a future date.
It is the purpose of the new com
pany to use the first floor of- the
large and comodlous Elks' Home
for the new enterprise, with the
posibilities of building an addition in
the rear of the home for parpha
nalia and for a stage in case they
should decide to construct a modern
theatre. The high price of cotton
and the aboundant yeild 'has restor
ed properity to Opelousas, is fully
reallized. This city has been with
one motion picture show for nearly
two years and now with the assur
ance of another, and the possibili
ties of one more goes beyound a
doubt to show that there is lots of
money.in sight.- Now, why not get
together and get industries of some
kind. Besides the New Syrup Mill,
which is now in operation and the
Opelousas Ice and Bottling Works,
what have we? A diversion is neces
sary. Fun and Frolic indulged in
sometimeor other helps to rest an
overburden mind. . Now that we
are assured of the wherewith to
slip away our few stray dimes, let
us not forget thatthere are other
things that, goes to make up a good
substantial town. And thatis the
establishing of industries of some
kind. Look at our neighboring
towns with saw mills, rice mills
slave mills, automobile spoke mill,
and and other industries with pay
rolls. Those are proofs right 'here
at home. Let us wake up and
take notice.
