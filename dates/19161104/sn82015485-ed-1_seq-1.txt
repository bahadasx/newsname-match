spect and confidence 'of all' with
whom he comes in contact. He pos
sesses splendid clerical ability and is
in eveiy way competent to take
charge of the affairs of this import

ties especially those as well equipped
as Mr. Hickman for they are worthy
ot the recognition of the voters. If

Pete DeBoer, our well known towns
man and long resident of Trego coun
ty, is the candidate on the Republi
can ticket for the office of sheriff ot
Trego county. Mr. DeBoer like most
of the Republican candidates does
not need a special introduction for
every one knows Pete. He is a big
hearted, hard working, honest man

port nim. He is physically built for
the oft times difficult duties of this

cowardly hair in his head. We can
assure the voters that they will make

"Favor to none fairness to all," will
be his motto if elected. Be sure to

Probate Judge
A. S. Peacock, candidate for re-election
to the office of probate judge
needs no lengthy "speil" from us for
he has made his reputation in this
office and nearly every person in Tre
go county is acquainted with him.
His excellent work is his recommen
dation to re-election. No probate
judge has ever been so faithful, al
ways on hand, ever looking to the
interests of this important office
Judge Peacock has read enough law
to stand him well in hand in tiie po
sition which he occupies. The fine
record of this office under Judge Pea
cock's administration is very com
monly commented upon by every one
and should assure him a good big ma
jority next Tuesday. See that be
gets it. If you want competent, ob-
lighing and accurate service, the kind
you have received in the past, the
kind you want in the future return
Mr. Peacock to the office of probate
judge.
County Attorney. t

office of county attorney on the Re
publican ticket grew up from child
hood in Trego county. For" many
years he was a resident of Qiiinter, and

where he erected a tine new residence
in the east part of town. He is a ris
ing young lawyer of ability havirg
graduated from the law department
of the Kansas University. He has
been admitted to the bar and has
been very successful in a number of
very difficult cases where good legal
judgment was used. He is fullj com
petent to take charge of this import
ant office as he has had experience
having served two terms as county
attorney of Gove county and while
in that capacity gave the Gove coun
ty people most satlafactory service.
This experience pats him In a, posi-
tion to hand e the atf jirs f this of-;
fi-3 in an efficient and aati.-factory j
manner. Ke s a voting irsn f spien- i
did standing, high ideal and uptight !
living and is m everv wav worthy to

vote for him next Tuesday.
Connty Superintendent "
C. E. Frye, candidate f.'V county
superintendent on the Republican
ticket is from Franklin township and
is widely known to the voters of tnis
countv. He is a young man of excel
lent character and standing. He has
had r larye experience in teaching,
holds a first grade certificate and is
much in touch with the things thai
pertain to this office.- He is thor
oughly conversant with the schools of
the county and their needs and has
the reputation of being an educator
of more than ordinary ability ail of
which bespeak the competency of the
young man for the office. Its been a
good while since a man has been in
the superintendent's office and we
believe it ought to be passed around
and especially to those who have liv
ed many years in the com ru unity arid
been faithful to its interests. We be
lieve the voters owe this office to Mr.
Frye this year and ask them to put
him in with a good majority at tiie
election next Tuesday.
' Clerk District Ccurt
, Ben J. Rogers, candidate for tiie of
fice of clerk of tlis itistrict court on
the Republican ticket is one of our
well know n old' timers and standbys
and all of his interests are here. His
integrity and splendid standing in
the community are excellent recom
mendations to a man who aspires to
public office. Ben. is in every way
competent to discharge the duties of
this office and a. his opponent has
held it two terms we feel that it is
time to give some one else a chance
and as Mr. Rogers is a resident and
taxpayer, a man of family, a man of
honor and splendid standing in the
community and in every way compe
tent to discharge the duties of this
office faithf ully.and well we ask the
voters not to fail to give him a good
majority at the election and p'ace
hic!1! the- office to which he- aspires
that of clerk of court. The office in
every detail will be kept up to the
highest standard with hiin in charge.
Surveyor . '
Hudson Harlanf Republican candi
date for re-election to the- office of
county surveyor needs no introduc
tion to the voters of this county. No
other man is fitied for this import
ant office as is Hudson Harlan wiio
has held it for many years and altho
he has never had serious opposition
ne has never slighted his duties but
looks after it well and gives it his
best attention.
Commissioner 2nd District
F. B. Walker, Republican Candi
date for the office of county commis
sioner from the 2nd district, has once
before been represented on the coun
ty board and is so widely known
throughout the county that he does
not need to be formally presented to
the people. Mi. Walker probably
knows the conditions and needs of
the 2nd district better than any other
man in it. His experience hitherto
on the board makes him a desirable
member. He will give if elected his
best service as he has always done in
tiie past and endeavor to discharge
his duties to the satisfaction of all.
Remember' him at the polls next
Tuesday.
Commissioner 3rd District
' Richard Owens, Republican candi
date for commissioner from the 3rd
district, comes from Collyer township.
He is very widely and favorably
known and has never been represent
ed on the county board. All of bis
interests are in the 3rd district being
one of the big farmers in that com
munity and thoroughly knowing its
conditions and needs. Mr. Owens has
never before asked for public recogni
tion and it seems to us that the peo
ple could not make a-wiser or better
choice than to choose him. He is
wide awake andprogressive and Uie
taxpayers can rest easy for Mr. Owens
will see to it that their interests are
carefuily guarded in every particu
lar. Remember Richard Qwens next
Tuesday and put him in as commis
sioner from the 3rd district.
