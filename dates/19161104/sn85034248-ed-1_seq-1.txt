"Mister 44."
Harold Lockwood and May Allison,
the popular and talented stars now
appearing together in Metro wonder
plays, will be seen at the Grand Thea
tre Sunday in "Mister 44," a five-part
feature .illed with romance and
beauty.
The story of "Mister 44" is an un
usual one, as the name implies. There
are many interesting glimpses of life
in the open, and contrasting pictures
of life in the factories, a cheap res
taurant in a city, in fashionable socie
ty, at a country club, and among the
picturesque lakes, rivers and moun
tains of Canada. From a scenic stand
point, and in point of beauty and col
or, "Mister 44" has not been surpass
ed upon the screen.
In the great out doors Mr. Lock
wood and Miss Allison are called upon
to display their prowess and daring
in many thrilling and gripping situa
tions. They are caught in a danger
ous and treacherous stream during a
storm and their boat capsized. They
finally reach a small island, where
they are marooned for a day and a
night. Under this trying situation
the noblest qualities of both come to
the surface, and they fall in love with
each other. On account of the girl's
lowly place in life, and the man's ex
alted position in society, many obsta
cles are presented, which are happily
overcome by their sturdy loyalty to
their ideals and each other.
"The Thousand Dollar Husband."
There is a good deal of genuine
pathos and not a little of genuine hu
mor in "The Thousand Dollar Hus
'band," which comes to the Grand
. .Monday. The story deals with the
nnselfish love and devotion of a girl
e ob
tion is a young man whose social
standing is very far above her own.
How the seemingly unbridgable gulf
is finally bridged by mutual esteem
and love is very prettily though at
times somewhat diffusely told in the
development of the plot.
Blanche Sweet plays the part of the
naive and unsophisticated servant girl
who through an access of unexpected
good fortune suddenly becomes weal
thy. The young man whom she has
learned to love faces disgrace and
poverty biought on by his own fault
when the girl comes to his rescue, will
ing to sacrifice not only her money
but her entire happiness to the salva
tion of the youth she loves. At first
the latter accepts the sacrifice with
out any thought of his own obliga
tions in the matter. Gradually, how
ever, he begins to realize that he owes
something to the girl. The latter's
views and character develop with her
improved oppoo tunities and this of
course aids in the drawing together of
the young souls.
"The Beast."
The adventures of an eastern
heiress among the rough. herdsmen
of the west form the basis of the
story of the William Fox photoplay,
"The Beast," in which Anna Luther
and George Walsh will appear at the
Grand Tuesday.
Miss Luther is the innocent little
eastern girl, Mildred Manning, who,
on a tour through the west with her
father, falls in with Del Burton
(George Walsh) and is taken prisone
by him, after he fights a gun du
with two other men. He takes he
his cabin, and nurses her back to
strength after she has succumbed to
the excitement of the adventure.
When she is well and strong once c
more, he sends her to her father, and
the tour is continued. Some time la
ter, Burton pays a visit to the east.
HIe is wealthy now, and society lion
izes him. lie meets Mildred, but she
does not recognize him in the cos- c
tume of city life.
The awakening comes when he ap- j
pears at a masquerade ball in his i
western clothes. Then she realizes v
who he is, and the old feeling of love ']
returns to oer heart. r
t
"The Gutter Magdalene." t
This production, which will be the t
Wednesday offering at the Grand, d
may be ranked as a thoroughly suc- g
cessful Lasky feature. In its clever a
seizure of profound psychological r
moments, in its portraiture of phases u
in underworld life, in its inspirational n
devotion to perfect details, the pic
tre stands in the first rank. The
ighest praise is none too high for the
merits of the film. Jack Dean, Billy r
Elmer, James Neill, Gertrude Keller
and Robert Bradbury made a most d
satisfactory cast. The story is a
strictly modern one,L the settings
as well as the atmo~ here lend great 1
force and interest to the production. h
The pictures and scenes of low life, t
while never in the least offensive, are F
startlingly true to life. The whole b
situation is handled with extraordi- h
nary skill. The feature is remark- p
ably free from padding.
"Little Lady Eileen." fi
Dainty little Marguerite Clark, e
herself the incarnation of the elf tlI
Sirit, is starred in the delightful tl
fairy tale, "Little Lady Eileen," y
which the Grand announces as its at
traction for Thursday.
At Miss O'Harahan's school for
g•.j, near Dublin, there is a misAev
oW pupil with the awe-inspiring me
of LadyEileenKavanaugh. Her pranks
are far from pleasing to Mistress
O'Harahan, and she is punished many
times until the sudden discovery that
her father is penniless leads to her
being withdrawn from the school.
Dennis Kavanaugh spends his en
tire time delving into the hundreds
of massive volumes which line the
walls of his library from floor to ceil
ing. While perched on his ladder
searching for a musty tome he dis
covers a will, yellow with age. The
contents of the will state that the en
tire estate of Terrence Kavanaugh,
amountinggo a vast sumacvill descend
to the eldest daughter of the house of
Kavanaugh 4videdhat she marry
the eldest son of the house of Church
hill.
On the train homeward bound
-en meets a handsome young
as fate will have it, is Sta
eldest g the Chure.lls. Du
his stay in Wileen's hol town Stan
ley and the little maid become deep
ly interested in each other, though
he never tells her his name. Mean
while George, his scape-grace broth
er, discovers the terms of the will,
presents himself at the Kavanaugh
home as the eldest of his family and
insists that the marriage be arranged
at once, despite Eileen's very evident
dis ste for him. The little g' 1 is
tried into the marriage, bu for
tunately her lover rescues her from
George on their wedding day. George,
believing he has killed Stanley in the
fight which ensues, flees on horseback,
but is killed by a huge boulder which
rolls down the mountainside.
Of course Stanley thinks he found
Eileen all by himself and that his
brother was killed by accident,' but
Eileen knows it was the fairies who
showed her her true lover and who
rolled the giant boulder down upon
the miscreant George.

"Through the Wall."
"Through the Wall," the six-reel
Vitagraph Blue Ribbon feature pic
tur from the novel by Cleveland
Mo tt, which will be shown at the
Gra n t Friday, has all the en
gross butes of tly well-made
pp . The mast'r crimina
s miraculous dexterity in th
f disguise and his manifold d
for the confounding of his ene
s, is the leading character. A
een-eyed, quick-witted and finely
developed detbtive ru him a close
second in power to fascinate the im
agination; End an engagitk heroine
and half a dozen other cleverly-drawn
characters complete the proper selec
tion of accepted types.
The title of the play applies to a
murder committed by the criminal ex
pert, for the purpose of removing one
enemy and fastening the crime on an
other. Two adjoining supper rooms
are used in perfor.iing the crime, a
jealous young woman being tricked
into boring a hole in the dividing
wall, in order to spy upon her lover.
The unfortunate man is shot in this
manner. The situations leading up
to the murder are dramatic in the ex
tr p1e, and involve a life-like a
tl.ling marine disaster, when an u
dersea boat torpedoes a large passen
ger ship. The escape of the detective
and his sweetheart from the rapidly
rising water in the vault-like passage
under the house of the criminal fur
nishes another strong climax.
"The Deserter."
Charles R*y is the stir of "The
Desert{ Triangle featuretWhich
will be seen at the Gem Theatre to
day.
The story deals with stirring
events at a frontier army post in
1868. Lieutenant Parker loses his
heart to Barbara Taylor, daughter of
the colonel in charge of the post. But
Barbara's affections have been won
by Captain Turner, and when the
handsome young lieutenant asks her
for her hand she has to say no.
Barbara does promise the disconso
late Parker that she will give him the
Farst waltz at the approaching Hallow
a'en ball. But when the time comes,
the first .ltz finds her whirlinfgabout
the floor with her intended. The
young lieutenant has a nasty temper,
and it becomes inflamed forthwith
,with anger and jealousy. He leaves the
ball in a rage and goes to a dive on the
outsl:irts of the post, where he tries
to drown his sorrows in bad whiskey
and worse company.
The gamblers at the tsort try to
cheat him at cards, and a fight starts.
The place is full of soldiers, who come
to the aid of the young officer; and a
general melee follows, which becomes
so violent that a detachment is sent
fiom the post. Turner leaves the ball
to command them, and is amazed to
find Parker in the middle of the mix
up. His rebuke inflames the boy still
further, and Parker strikes his supe
rior officer. His arrest follows.
Facing court martial, the young of
ficer escapes from prison, and flees in
to the desert. There he is found, per
ishing of hunger and thirst, by a cara
van of settlers, among whom is Mary,
a girl of seventeen, who speedily loses
her heart to the boy. Attacked by In
dians, the settlers face massacre, when
Parker creeps out. mounts a stray
horse and dashes for the fort. One
lone Indian clings to his trail, finally
overtakes him, and leaps from his own
horse to Parker's. As the two fight
in the saddle, the horse plunges over
a cliff 70 feet high, and men and horse
plunge and roll to the bottom of the
steep declivity.
The Indian is killed, but Parker and
the horse are still able to travel, and
the fort is reached. The rescuers
save a part of the settle- s from
slaughter, among them Mary, who
finds, when she arrives at the fort, the
body of a hero lying under a fleg. The
boy has succumbed to his wounds. Af
ter his name in the post records the
word "Deserted" is crossed out, and
there remains only the record of his
sacrifice of his life for others.
"The Habit of Happiness."
The Gem announces as its; Sunday
offering "The Habit of Happiness," a
powerful society drama fe..turing

BIG ATTRACTION FOR FAIRS.
Spectacle of Scrapping Statesmen
Shaking Hands Suggested.
The New Orleans Item made a fa
cetious suggestion in its issue of Oct.
4 which might have been worth the
attention of the management of the
South Louisiana Fair Association had
it not come too late for pulling off the
proposed spectacle at the recent Don
aldsonville exposition. The text for
s the Item's disquisition was found in
the following Associated Press de
spatch from New York:
"Theodore Roosevelt and William H. Taft
clasped hands for a moment tonight at the
SNew York Union League Club's reception to
1 Charles E. Hughes. Mr. Hughes himself
stood by.
"'We shook hands,' Mr. Taft said after
"ward, 'just as any gaotlemen would shake
] hands.'
"(olonel Roosevelt dieclined to comment
upon the meeting."
Quoth the Item:=
"Every errant circumstance is an
inspiration to alert minds that are
- awake to the passiig moment's fleet
ing chance. This is the festive sea
son of the parish fair. In the sombre
joy of the happy reunion so touching
ly described above, these two great
characters sternly, repressing their
::urging pleasure at each other's pres
ence, and merely greeting each other
like gentlemen, is the kernel of an
idea for our parish fairs promoters.
"We read, for instance, that 'Mayor
Behrman and Commissioner Newman
have gone to attend the Donaldson
ville fair,' and that 'Nick Sims will ad
0o be there.' Now'Nick Sims, as a
spectacle for a Donaldsonville crowd,
is ridiculous. As much as his repute
for great beauties of character at
tract people to Nick in other commu
nities, the people of Donaldsonville
are so well acquainted with him that
he is of no more use for show pur
poses there than Rumsey Duke, 'Tony'
Goette, or any other member of the
Ice House Set, would be.
"Harold, as an orator, is elegant as
well as eloquent, and the music of
speech, it is true, still hath charms to
soothe the savage breast. His Honor
carries a great deal of weight where
ever he goes. But'if the truth must
be told, the novelty, has been some
what worn off both df them, as attrac
tions for country crowds, by the long
friction of repeated boosting expedi
Lions into the strange wilds beyond
the Carrollton protection levee.
"Now why don't the enterprising
managers of all succeeding fairs take
a leaf from the boek of the Union
League? Why domne they bring the
Hen. Robert F. Broussard and the
Hon. Joseph E. Ra dell into affec
tionate juxtapositit on every plat
form from Bogalu Tallulah? Why
not let Mr. Rans nd Mr. Brous
sard 'clasp hand moment,' on
o tiese egcasions, while
breath and qith h anticipation
of horrors that si not ensue.
"We maintain That our statesman
thip in Louisiana is the equal of any
on earth. If Mr. Roosevelt and Mr.
faft can be made to shake hands
like gentlemen,' so can Mr. Ransdell
:and Mr. Broussard.
"Andl if city talent is to be enlisted,
let it be the real thing. Let Col. Rob- 1
ert Ewing take the place of Judge 1
Charles Hughes, and stand benignant
y by, :and smile, and smile, while Mr.
Ransdel and Mr. Broussard, emotion- I
ally ov'crcome by their mutual prox
imity, are shaking hands-for a mo- I
ment-like gentlemen.
"No such spectacle has ever before t
been presented on the stage of any i
parish fair in the two centuries of
Louisiana's civilization. No bull that
ever was bred could compete with it
in rural interest. No prize pen of
Rhode Island roosters could so deeply
challenge the admiration of the farm- I
er's wife.
"Go to it, you enterprising promo
ters of the festal fair. We don't
charge you a cent for the suggestion."
SHOULD BE ON COLLEGE LIST.
Local High School Among Others
Eligible for Recognition.
Donaldsonville High School should
make an effort to get on the accredit
ed list of the southern colleges, ac
cording to C. A. Ives, state high school
inspector.
Louisiana now has only seven high
schools on the accredited list of the
commission. These are the high
schools of Shreveport, Homer, Ouach
ita parish, Bolton (Alexandria), Hou
ma, University demonstration high
school, and the Isidore Newman Man
ual Training School of New Orleans.
Other schools which Mr. Ives be
lieves should qualify for approval are
Opelousas, Mansfield, Hammond, Mor
gan City, Franklin, Bogalusa, Don
aldsonville, Leesville, DeRidder, Sul
phur, Bastrop, Minden and ,Baton
Rouge.
The schools now fall short of the
requirements chiefly in two respects:
Lack of sufficient number of college
graduates in their faculties and too
much work for their instructors.
The next annual session of the com
mission will be held in Durham, N. C.,
November 14 to 17.
Newspapers Hard Hit by War Prices.
During the past month a half dozen
Louisiana weekly newspapers havei
announced an increase in price to
$1.50 a year, that being the only alter
native to suspension. Paper, which
less than a year ago cost little more
than two cents a pound, now brings
from six to seven cents in the open
market. Concretely this means that
where a weekly newspaper a year ago
gave 14 cents out of its subscription
price for paper in a year, it now gives
39 to 45½ cents. Of course this ap
plies equally to daily papers. The
increase in paper cost to the Ameri
can-Press over last year at the pre
vailing market price would be $12 to
$15 a day, or between $4000 and
$5000 a year. Newspapers can stand
this drain in hope of better conditions
f.or a while, but eventually if condi
tions continue prices must go up
somewhere.-Lake Charles American

SHORT PECAN CROP AND WHY.
SHurricane of 1915 Responsible for
Low Yield This Year.
WBy C. W. EICHLING in Modern Farming.
When the hurricane of September
29, 1915, struck the Gulf coast, the
pecan trees were loaded to the break
ing point. All the fruit was knocked
off, and not being fully matured, it
was a total loss. But this was not
the only damage the storm did to
pecan trees; it also destroyed the
crop of 191 and this is how it was
done. W
The pecan tree, like other fruit
trees, has two distinct kinds of buds,
the fruit bud and the leaf bud. These
buds form during the period of rest,
say from October to March. The
fruit bud forms the embryo or germ
for the coming blossom and fruit,
which in some varieties of trees is so
distinctly developed in the fruit bud
as to be easily distinguishable upon
dissecting the bud. These fruit buds
are to remain in a dormant condition
during the winter and bring forth the
blossom with the rising of the sap in
the spring.
When the 1915 storm struck the
trees in September, it defoliated them
completely, and the trees being yet in
sap, this sap had to find an outlet.
There were no leaves to take up
sap, and it pushed
which were yet uneve ope
should have rested during the winter.
We all remember the budding out and
blossoming of many kinds of trees
last year after the storm; the pears
and wild cherries even blossomed and
almost ripened a crop. But the pecan
buds simply came out in form of
leaves and there was not sufficient
time to form new fruit buds. This
meant the destruction of the fruit
crop of 1916.
There is an erroneous belief among
some people that pecan trees bear on
ly every other year. There is nothing
in the nature of the pecan tree to jus
tify this statement. The crop depends
very much on the proper fertilization
of the blossom.
The pecan has a distinct male and
female blossom. The male blossom
appears in advance of the female and
is in form of catkins or wormlike
blossoms similar to those of the live
oak. The female blossom resembles
a cluster of tulip-shaped upright lit
tle flowers ranging in number from
one to six. When the male flower is
in perfect condition to shed the pollen
and fertilize the female blossom, it
sometimes occurs that steady rains
prevent the pollen from flying and
reaching the female blossom. The pe
riod o fconceptive condition passes
and there will be a very small crop,
if any. This is in the vegetable king
dom the same as in the animal world.
which has never been sufficiently ex
plained in literature as to make it gen
erally understood.
Notwithstanding the discourage
ments of the past season pecan cul
ture the coming year promises to show
an increase in keeping with the true
value of the industry. Taken alto
gether, it is difficult to find a crop
which is as certain or is as able to
withstand the unfavorable conditions
as the pecan.
Even after the damage done by the
big September storm of last year, we
all saw a decided impetus to pecan
plantings. The writer has noticed with
pleasure that each succeeding season
there is a greater tendency to effect
increased plantings of the best named
varieties in Louisiana and Mississippi.
The purchase of stock from reliable
nurserymen insures success when a
due measure of attention is given to
the crop, and the trees will begin to
bring returns far sooner than most
people think.

THE LESSON O f E FAIR.

which the enterprise und to exert
upolthat communi is scarcely
necwsary to say tha advantages
will accrue to other c unities rom

to the people of th even parishes
represented in the th Louisiana
Fair Association to tinue the se
ries of annual exhib ns conducted
during the past four rs at Donald
sonville by that or zation. The
Democrat says:
"The parish fair, ich closed a

"In variety of displa `in excellence
of individual exhibits,h demonstrat
ing resourcefulness in 11 fields of hu
man endeavor, the Jferson parish
fair afforded a most s ibstantial proof
of the greatness of our people when
working together to show the world
what was in them. Never before has
the world, or have we, appreciated the
possibilities of Jefferson soil, or the
magnitude of our industrial output,
or the quality of the craftsmanship of
our men, women andc'ehildren. We
have been asleep to the great things
that have been moving about us, some
near, many at distane~e beyond the
range of the circle of-q.ur little lives.
But at this great fair we have seen
this wonderful demon ration group
ed within the confi .of four nar

The spectacle has -ed us by its
infinite variety; ou is -inin

"For the tireless workers-who toil
ed through the long days and nights
to inaugurate and bring to a success
ful consummation this splendid expo
sition of Jefferson's possibilities no
meed of praise possible to bestow
would be adequate. Against many
drawbacks, in the face often of dis
heartening and discouraging odds they
struggled on. Their goal was ahead
and they could see it and it alone.
The indomitable spirit of Leo A. Mar
rero was equal to all emergencies. No
man could say him nay, for he would
not take nay for an answer. Sur
rounded by a faithful corps of work
ers, all striving for the same end
the upbuilding of Jefferson-he plod
ded on, brushing aside every obstacle
in the path, until the goal was reach

"This is but the beginning of the
Jefferspj fair. It will be a permanent

glorious outcome of the initial effort,
and they will work as a unit to make
each succeeding one greater than its

Editorial in Daily States, Oct. 17.
The Lake Charles American-Press,
in line with the Donaldsonville Chief
and other level-headed country news
papers, is segregating the local
amendments from the eighteen on the
official ballot and urging the country
vot rs to support them. Very cor
re ', says the Press, the people of
the ate can offer no reasonable ob
jection to these local amendments, un
less the people of the communies
concerned show hostility to them.
The Press picks eight such amend
ments, including those in which New
Orleans is interested, and incidental1
ly says that everyone in the statd
should desire to see New Orleans
prosper and hence help her to keep
her financial affairs untangled, which
they can do by voting for the city
bond amendment.
In the same spirit we say the peo
ple of New Orleans ought to manifest
their wish to see Lake Charles pros
per by voting for the amendment
which would help that city in carry
ing out ns for a deep water port.
T ess raises a protest against
th it hears in some quarters for
ting down of all the amend
ts in order to force a constitution
onvention. We have heretofore
d attention to the fact that some
ninformed people here, professing
be deeply interested in the welfare
o the schools, have been urging this
very thing.
The Press correctly points out that
a convention following the voting
(down of the amendments is out of the
question. If the amendments are
beaten it will he evidence of the
strength of the opposition to any tink
.gng with the constitution at this
Wme. If the opponents of the tax, as
:essment, fee and other reforms now
proposed are strong enough to reject
them, they will be strong enough to
beat a convention, which, they would
argue, was intended to defeat the will
of the people as expressed next month.

IT HAPPENED IN THIS CITY.
And is Happening to Donaldsonville
People Every Week.
The case told below is not an un
ommon thing. The same occurs fre
quently and will continue to happen
as' long as folks have kidneys and
overtax the kidneys.
Mrs. E. Landry, 312 Lessard street,
Donaldsonville, says: "I suffered for
years from a floating kidney. At
times my back pained me so that I
pould hardly do my housework with
out having sharp pains across my kid
neys. In the morning, I dreaded to
et up, as my back pained me so I
Id hardly dress myself. My kid
ys did not act regularly and some
s I was very nervous. Nothing
k did me any good until I got
Kidney Pills at the Palace
Dru tore. The first box relieved
the mi ry in my back and I kept on
until I had finished six boxes, when
my kidneys were in good working or
der."
Price 50 cents, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy--get
Doan's Kidney Pills-the same that
Mrs. Landry had. Foster-Milburn Co.,
