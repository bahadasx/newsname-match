"With great sadness and profound In

the great sufferings of Germans made

Russia, where numerous cases of brutal

in British camps, from which there are
numerous complaints. Prisoners are
often forced to work under" degrading
conditions. Frequently they must toll

deficient, and badly prepared.'
Prince von Schoenjrfch acknowledged

Hughes Establishes Travel Record.
Mr. Hughes holds the' record tor
campaign journeys. When he reached
Now York yesterday he had made four
dlBtlnct trips, which have carried him
thru thirty-two states and a distance
of 28,000 miles.
President .Wilson's campaign has had
the assistance-of his cabinet members
and of Vice President Marshal^, while
Mr. Hughes enjoyed thp U*fiquV-dis
tinction of having two former occu
pants of' the White -House- on" thj»

The increase in the number of states
where women* iday vote this year has
given women greater part in a cam

train of women who have been trav

arrived here last night for the closing
meeting of their campaign. They have
journeyed 11,700 miles and held 1#1
meetings in twenty-eight states.
Not Path to War.
"That is not the path to war that
Is the way. to maintain our self respect.
Rights cease to be rights If they arfe
not enforced. It Is not that we should
have a policy of aggression, it Is not
that we should make a braggart as
sertion of our claims that we should
go thru the world boastful and trucu
lent but It is that, wherever our flag
files, the American citizen who law
fully Is pursuing his work should know
that it la. a symbol of full protection
to him, exercising his rights wherever
he may happen to be, whether it be.
on land or on the high seas.
"There are those who attempt 'to
make political capital out of the pros
perity we now enjoy, Everyone knows
how suddenly it arose and how sud
denly It is likely to depart. Our friends
on the other side made eloquent
promises. Promises they make now
could not be more eloquent than those
they made four years ago.
An Unwelcome Guest.
"They told us they were 'going to
reduce the cost of living .they were
going to increase the opportunities of
labor they were going to provide ade
quate revenue for the government thru
their flew system they were going to
afford new opportunities for American
enterprise
"They haven't touched the cost of
living. That unwelcome guest, 'the high
cost of living, is still with us, a little
higher and a little stronger than ever
before. Instead of reducing the cost
of living .the opportunities for mak
ing a living were reduced. We hive
not forgotten that condition which

"The reasons lay in the European

British Press Foresees Plan ta Feres
Abandonment ef Search at Kirkwall.
London, Nov. 4.—A speoial dispatch
from Amsterdam features a statement
of the Berlin Kreus Zeitung to the ef
fect that Germany has decided to mak«
the safety of neutral ships carrying
neutral cargoes dependent on guaran
tees that no part of such cargoes shall
be landed, whether thru British com*
pulsion or not, at British ports.
Such guarantees, the paper adds, can
consist only In a formal undertaking
by Great Britain and auoh an under*
taking will be reoognixed by Germany
only froc cass to,caee. This is taksn
to mean that in event of any neutral
cargo or part thereof being landed in
England the German government will
immediately cease to recognise the In
violability of neutral ships.
The Berlin paper Impliea that ths
case of the Dutch freighter Bloomers
dljk, which was sunk by a German
submarine off Nantucket on Oct. S, will
be argued along these lines and It will
contend, since the intermediate des
tination of the vessel was Kirkwall,
there was no guarantee that the whole
cargo would reaoh Holland.
The English View.
The British press infers, from a Ber
lin dispatch summarised In the Koel
nlscho Zeitung, that Germany proposes
to sink all neutral ships, whether bear
ing neutral oargoea or otherwise, un
less Great Britain consents to abandon
the right to compel discharge at Kirk
wall of any part of a neutral cargo
suspected of having an enemy deatina-*
