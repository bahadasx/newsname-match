COLLEGE MEN JOIN
IN NOISY WELCOME
Hailed asuNext President"
? Brooklyn Tour a Whirl
wind of Enthusiasm
Manhattan and Brooklyn combined
labt night to make Charles E. Hughes's
homecoming an uproarious welcome.
His return to New York City for the
last two days of his campaign for the
Presidency developed into an unexpect
ed tribute, in which at least 25,000 per?
sons participated.
Thousands of commuters at the Crand
Central Station joined their cheers with
those of the Hughes and Fairbanks col?
lege men, when Mr. Hughes stepped out
into the concourse. They crowded about
him, struggling for B glimpse. The
brass band, blaring away, the college
men with their raucous tin honis, the
police cscort and the members of his
party were pushed and shoved and
jo?tled about in a riotous mass of hu?
manity that followed the candidate out
mto Forty-second Street, up Fifth Ave?
nue and across to the Hotel A?tor.
Three rnthusiastic meetings in
Brooklyn added later to Mr. Hughes's
confidence that he will carry not only
[***W York State, but most of the nation
with it next Tuesday. About four thou?
sand people struggled for breathing
space in the New National Hall in
(ireenpoint. Brownsville would gladly
have filled tive building* of the capacity
of Independence Hall. Kismet Temple,
at Nostrand Avenue and Dean Street,
was crammed with nearly MM more.
who cheered Mr. Hughes fnr nimost tive
minutes after he arrived.
Hughes Taken by Surprise
Mr. Hughes waa taken wholly un
awares. however, by the demonstration
at the Crand Central Station. He had
expected to slip over to hia hotel anJ
prepare for the night meetings. But
when the special train which had car?
ried him through thirty-five states ;f
the l'nion drew into the terminal. the
Hughes and Fairbanks college men,
blowing away on their tin horns.
trooped up the platform and led a pa?
rade out into the concourse. The
Forty-secor.d Street entrance jammed
hke the neck of a bottle when the masi
tried to follow Mr Hughes out all at
once. Outside there were red fire, an?
other bnnd and more men and women
who wanted to see Mr. Hughes.
The candidate's tour through Brook?
lyn was a whirlwind whur. of an auto?
mobile procession. When Mr. Hughes
entered the Greenpoint meeting he said
he felt right at home.
"Our next President!" shouted many
voice.". Just as quict was obtained and
Mr. Hughes tried to speak an old man
down in front stood up to say:
"1 voted for Lincoln, (iovernor, aad
this time my vote la for Hughes."
Which started the crowd otf again.
Now Confident of Vietory
"I have just returned," said Mr.
Hughes. "from a very extraordinary
trip. It has been my privilege to
visit the states of Connecticut, Rhode
Island, Ohio, Indiana and ft large part
of New York since I spoke in Brook?
lyn nine days ago. I return with very
deep confidence that the reunited Re?
publican party is going to march to a
triumphant vietory next Tuesday. 1
hope it will be a vietory not only for
the national ticket but for the Con
gressionaland state tickets; that there
will be a complete Republican sweep."
His principal topics last night were
the tariff, "was prosperity" and Amer
ican rights and Americanism. Speak
ing to a very responsive audience in
Ki-met Temple, his last meeting in
Brooklyn. Mr. Hughes declared em
phatically: ?
"If I am elected President" the
crowd interrupted with shouts: "You
will. You will. Charlie."
??If I am eU-cted," he continued, I

The Austrians are resisting tiercelv.

Italian rush has cut through positions

Paid as They Paraded
"Did you know you were to be paid
for marching before you joined the pa?
rade?"
"Sure I did. I only call that good I
business. The word was all around on ?
Third Avenue. They told us they
wanted to make a good showing when
thfl President came to town, and there |
would be BO cents in it for the bov* |
who marehed. We got our money while I
we were marching right along Fi ft r.

quarters sfepped along and slipped us
four bits apiece. He had a pocketful j
of half dollars."
"What headquarters is that?"
"Sixteenth Distriet, Tammany Hall." |

The exact figures as to the number of

betting odds meant nothing except the
wish of Wall Street to see Mr. Wilson
defeated.
"The odds are wholly fictitious," he
said. "They bear no relajion to the
chances of either candidate for vic?
tory."
The following bets were offered in
Wall Street: $25,000 to $20,000 that Mr.

UPON PRESIDENT
Lincoln and Washington
Cited to Prove Execu?
tive Is Weak
Culonfl Roosevelt mar.-halled an
army of ghosts to cont'ront Wood?
row WttaaM last night. From the
platform of Cooper Union, he peo
pled the reaches of Shadow I.awn,
the PresMent's summer residence.
with an accusing host of shades. He
pictured the hands of dead men and
women stretched toward a man who
could not hear. He pictured the.
voices of *hose who have gone to
their death, without the protection
of the flafc, calling to a man who
could not hear.
They were all there?"the shadows
of Shadow Lawn" -thost' American?,
hi said. who had died while Woodrow
Wilson BBt in the White House,
and whose nmrders he never ha?
avenged:
The men, women and children of
the Lusitania, killed by a foreign
?wwer, with whom the United States
remains on terms of diplomatic
friendliness, "the shadows of the
helpless whom Mr. Wilson did not
dare to protect, iest he might have
to face danger."
The shadows of the trooperi *lam at
Carrizal following the flag, which went
no further after their defeat becau?e
President Wilson. who had sent them
to do a task. then "shamefully aban
doned them to the mercy of their foes."
Other "Shadowa" Clted
Thee* were some of the "shadows"
that Theodore Roosevelt aaw ereeping
about the house of. hun who aaka tha
American people to reelect him next
Tusday.
Other shadei were in that doloroua
company. Even Washington and Lin?
coln were called upon to eonfront tha
President?the tirst tj answer Secre?
tary Baker's eomparison of the men of
Valley Forge with the men of Villa and
a score of border outrages, the other to
bear mute testimony that it was not
"bad policy to swap horse* erossing a
creek " Men in the tense days of UM
swapped horses ? a Lincoln for a
Buchanan.
And then. with that mute company
grouped before Shadow I.awn, Colonel
Roosevelt called upon the erowd which
jammed Cooper l'nion to its roof and
overflowed taff out into the ?tr**t?. to
"place in the White House the upright
justice. the f<-arless Governor of tha
State of New Vork, who will do nght,
no matter what influence is brought
agninst him."
Colonel Roosevelt referred to the
nation's crisis fs "a criflis preemi
nently mrral and spiritual," and said
that President Wilson had failed to
vindicate American tradition in every
in*tance.
Oldtime Teddy in Action
In this, the fir*t official appearance
Colonel Roosevelt has made ln New
York in this campaign, he wn tha
Roosevelt of old -full of fire and with
? "the punch" in every *enience that
time after time roused those of the
trowd of 25,000 that were able to get
into the hall to frenzied cheers. Again
1 boo* and hii'se* marked a point scored
ugainst the Administration. At timea
? there was laughti r, as when he re?
ferred to Secretary Baker as "an ami?
able ger.tleman who like* to knit." Thia
rocked the house with laughter.
It was not. however. until referring
to Mr. Wilson's raaMaaee at Shadow
I.awn. he described thi- shadow* of
I slain Americans that should be there.
' that he reached his climax. In a
silence that permitted his voice to be
heard in tne furthest eorners of tha
hall, Colonel Roosevelt spoke slowly,
clipning of his words in charaeterifltie
style und nausing solmnly betw??n
phrases until he had reached the end.
; Then th* crowd swirled on to the plat?
form, whence able-bodied friends hus
tled him to his automobile that he might
speak at anothei meeting ia the Na?
tional Theatre. at Second Avenue and
Houston Street.
