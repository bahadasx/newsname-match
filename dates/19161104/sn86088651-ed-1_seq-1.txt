do you want a
new cmchirter?
Opportunity Will Be Given to Express
Yourself Tuesday at the Polls.
Last Word From McElroy.
To the Voters and Tax Payers of
Aryan:
Tuesday, November 7th, the oppor
tunity will be presented to you to vote
for a commission of fifteen of Bryan's
conservative yet progressive business
men to draft a new charter for our
city. At the same time you will be
offered the opportunity of voting on
the only question really involved In
the election, "Do you want a new char
ter?" Twenty five 1 names were selected
by a committee appointed by the presl
dent of your Commercial Club and
your mayor, which makes the ticket
from whlcu fifteen are to be elected.
These names appear on a separate
ticket and their position on the tlckot
was determined by lot, drawing the
names from a bat
It seems that few of our citizens
do not quite understand the interpre
tation of. the law, hence we desire to
make this last statement, to the end
that every feature may be plain to all
the voters.
If the proposition carries, then the
fifteen that are elected from the
i ; twenty-five names on the ticket will
constitute a "Charter Commission,"
whose duties will be to construct a
f barter. After they have completed
same, another election will be ordered
, by your city council for the purpose
adoptpg said charter, same to be
, voted on section by section. You
have, then, the privilege of voting
against any section (or the entire
charter) no' meeting your approval.
It U not the purpose of your Corn-
Ing her largest tax payers, after more
than four years of careful, considerate
study of Impending conditions and
needs In many ways, have decided
Bryan's only chance to grow Is by
creating or building a new charter.
twhlch means many new buildings In
all lines private as well aa public
better sewerage, water and llghta for
the wage earner as well as the capital
ist. Think It over. Consider for a
moment some of the younger Tessa
towns which have outgrown Bryan
much older, after the adoption of a
modern charter.
We ran understand why you might
vote against a new charter whi n pre
sented to you -but we rsn't compre
hend why anyone who wishes to see
,Brsn grow will deny the right to
framVa new charter to those who ar
dently support this measure. Your
affirmative vote on Tuesday simply
mean a new charter will be SI'N
MITTKH to you later for your adop
tion or rejection.
