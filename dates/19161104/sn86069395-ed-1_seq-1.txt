John R. Commlns, professor of po-
cal economy at the' University of
Wisconsin, is one of the big republi
cans who came out for Wilson this
week.
A small boy at Vincennes, Ind., fell
out of a persimmon tree and was
found unconscious and 'being rooted,
about by hogs under the tree four
hours later. His recovery is hoped
for.
The Rexall strawvote elects Wilson
with New York, Illinois and Indiana
counted for Hughes. Kansas, Mon

North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota,
Utah, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wy
oming, Oklahoma and the solid south
are counted for "Wilson.
The alleged ink scandal has about
it many odors of improbability. It
seems strange that any business
'house would run an open account to
$219,000, for a period of two years,
with no payments made and all or
ders .received over the telephone.
If the ink was never shipped, where
is it?
Mr. flughesgave up a $12,500 office
to lead the forlorn hope of a discred
ited party. He has no doubt realized
djiTing his disappointing campaign,
vjfat he made a foolish mictake in
giving up a bird in the hand for one
in the bush, with the cold winter
coming on, too. New York papers
will probably' in a few days have in
their want columns an appeal fori
work for a statesman out of a job.
Mr. Hughes is running display ad
vertisements defining his principles
as follows:
Executive responsibility. ''
An able cabinet
A firm foreign policy.
A flag that protects.
Trade preparedness.
Government oversight of business.
A policy of industrial peace.
Could any set of platitudes be
weaker or more meaningless. His
able cabinet would doubtless be
made up of able statesmen who
change their polities' every four years
and are anything to'get into office.

Forbes Manufacturing Co.
Will Transfer Implement
Stock.
TO PUSH OTHER LINES
Change To Take Effect On
the 20th of the Present
Month.
Owing to the pressure of business
in their various other departments,
the Forbes Manufacturing Company
have deemed it expedient to sell their
entire stock of farm machinery, im
plements, buggies, fertilizers, field
seeds and plows to Messrs. F. A.
Yost Co. The transfer of stock will
take place on Nov. 20th.
The demand for Mogul wagons is
unprecedented in the history of their
business and in order that Mr. M. C.
Forbes might be in position to give
i more of his time to the wagon busi
ness, the directors of Forbes Manu
facturing Co., decided to dispose of
this department, and give their entire
time to the hardware, contracting,
lumber, saw mill, blacksmith, stoves
and china, tin and plumbing and elec
trical departments, which business is
growing by leapsund bounds.
The lines disposed of have been
carried into the office building on
Main street, detached from the other
departments, and taking up a great
deal of valuable room. Other plans
are in vieJtorthe big offjee building,
one of thehanjhjomest and most com
modious buildings onhdn street.
THE ATHENAEUM
Hears Two Good Papers and
Engages in a Prolonged
Discussion.
The November meetiug . of the
Athenaeum was held at Hotel Latham
Thursday night with Vice President
A. H. Eckles nresidintr and the loh
lowing members present: J. W.
Downer. T. C. Underwood. John
Stites, J. G. Gaither, Austin Bell, Ira

C. M. Thompson, fieo. E. Gary, Pet
tus White, Jas. A. McKcnzie, P. B.
Brooks, Lewis Powell and G. C.
Hoffman.
' Two very interesting papers vere
read. Mr. Geo. E. Gary in a paper
of literary excellence argued that "the
world was undergoing a gradual pro
cess of retrogression, and that the
future held out no hope of equaling
the past in any respect,
Dr. C. M. Thompson gave a bio
graphical sketch of Jerry McCauley,
a New York philanthropist, who be
gan life as a criminal, was converted
Jn Sing Sing and became one of the
noted slum workers and agents for
great good during the civil war per
iod and when he died in 1884 was
honored with a monument erected by
popular subscriptions. Both papers
were discussed by nearly every qne
present, Mr. Gary's especially being
vigorously combatted by the optimists,
who argued that tho world is growing
better all the time.
The meeting proved to be an ex
cellent one and both writers were
congratulated on the originality of
their themes and the carefulness with
which tho program was prepared.
Mr. Ed L. Weathers was elected to
the only vacancy in the membership.
The usual excellent dinner was
served in the ordinary.

DEMOCRATS
JUBILANT
Over a Handsome Gain Made
In Supplemental Regis
tration. The supplemental .registration was
completed Wednesday night, with a
total of 168 names added in three
days, 104 white and 64 colored. By
parties there were 94 Democrats, 69
Republicans and 5 Independents.
Adding these names to the regular
list the total is as follows:""
W. C. D. R. Ind.
No. 1 191 187 147 216 13
No. 2 38 2C2 31 28f. 5

1,376 887 1,090 1,102 61
Majority 12
These figures show a total of 2,263,
or 104 short of the registration last
year. The missing voters are prac
tioally all Republicans and the slender
majority of 12 for the Republicans in
the city, is not counting 61 . Independ
ents. As the Independents are more
likely to vote with the Democrats,
especially on the local ticket, the
Democrats are confident of carrying
the city by a substantial majority.

HERE TO PROBE
CAR SHORTAGE
Commissioner McChord To
Begin Hearings
To-day.
Louisville," Ky., Nov. 3. Commis
sioner C. C. McChord of the Interstate
Commerce Commission, who is to
hold hearings here Saturday in an ef
fort to ascertain the reasons for the
unusual car shortage, arrived in Lou
isville. He will remain in Louisville
through the balance of this week and
part of next week.
The railroads have decided upon an
increase in demurrage charges as a
int'iina of reducing the car shortage,
according to tariffs issued yesterday
by local lines. The increases are an
nounced to become effective Decern
ber 1.
Instead of a flat charge of $1 a day
after tiie expiration of the present for
ty-eight-hour free time period, the
new tariff proposes a charge for $2
for the first day after the expiration
of the free time, $3 for the second
day, for the third day and $5 for
each day following.
The increase is intended, according
to railroad men, to induce the prompt
unloading of cars placed for shippers.
Discussion of the demurrage mat
ter, which has been under considera
tion by railroads and shippers for
some weeks, is expected to feature
the heaJing to be conducted by Com
missioner McChord into the car short
age question.

Judge.
The Demomcratic campaign closes
in Christian county with the Demo
crats in fine feather. Judge Bush was
out at Edwards Mill Thursday nigbt
and he and L. E. Foster addressed a
crowd of 100 voters, and many wo
men and children. Speakings wero
held last night at several other
places.
To-night Congressman Hcflin, of?
Alabama, will be the orator at a rally
at the court house. A big crowd is
sure to be on hand.
The Republicans on the other hand
are having poor rowds. At Attains '
Store, in North Christian, it is said,
only five men and three women wero
out to hear Judge Fowler. At Bain
bridge only 15 people, and at BlufC
Spring only six are reported as being;
present. The night meetings among;
the colored people may be doing bet
ter, but there are no outward eviden
c?s of enthusiasm.

practically all the Democrats who did
not vote last year are going to voto
this time. The Republican majority
of Morrow over Stonley was 2033 Inst
year, with Democratic vote 70ft short,
of the normal strength. The Repub
lican majority will be cut half in two.
Reports from Calloway are that tho
Stanley majority of 1300 will be in
creased to 2000 this year. Trigg will
give Bush 150 and Lyon 250 majority.
Bush, even conceding Fruit 1200 ire

the district. But let every Democrat
do his full duty.
