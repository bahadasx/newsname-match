WASHINGTON. Nov. 4. "Charles E.
Hughes will bo elected President of' the
United States next Tuesday, commanding a
majority approaching twenty-flvo in the
electoral .college."
That statement' is made upon tha au
thority of the most aatute polltlpalobserver
ill i-iio avcpuujiuaii ruuKB, wiiu, ill u icic
phone message from' New" York to the
Eveningi Ledger correspondent at noon
toddy, said that Indiana, Illinois and Mew
York- were certain to cast their electoral
votes for Hughes, assuring his electtgn.
This Republican manager has been actively
at the head of the doubtful States, and his
Information Is tho very best obtainable. He
declared that the people of these doubtful
States had now "obtained their second sober
thoughts" and were convinced that the con
tinuation of the Domocratlo p'arty In power
would be Injurious to tho country when
tho war ended.
CQNGItESS TO BE DIVIDED
The next Congress will be divided polit
ical, and if Mr. Hughes Is elected, even
by a majority exceeding tho estimated fig
ures, ho will not have his party entirely
in control In Congress.
Indications point to a Democratic ma
jority of at least three, and probably Ave,
In the Senate. This Bcant majority, how
ever, will disappear on tariff measures, as
there are five Southern Senators who, for
local tariff reasons, usually vote with tho
Republicans.
Both congressional campaign managers
are claiming control of the next House,
Representative Frank P. Woods", chairman
of the Republican Congressional Committee,
announced today that the Republicans would
have a majority of twenty-seven In the
House., while Representative Frank E.
Doremus, directing the Democratic cam
paign, said that President Wilson would be
re-elected and that a Democratic House
would be behind him the next four years.
As accurate canvasses as are obtainable
nhow that the Republicans are leading In
tho race for control of the House. The
situation as revealed by returns Is that the
Republicans lead by five for control of the
House, with .twenty-three districts doubtful.
There are many disturbing Influences In
congressional districts, such as labor and
the women's vpte, that jnake analysis very
dlfflcult. The contest for tho House, be
caUse of these cross currents,, la admittedly
close, but with' Hughes gaining In the piv
otal States, the struggle for control of the
House would seem to favor the Republi
cans, i
Indications are that the political com
plexion ot the Pennsylvania congressional

Only One Survivor Is
Reported
LONDON, Nov. 4 At least one hundreC
Uvea wero lost In the Irish Sea last night,
when the ferry steamship Connemara and
the ocean steamship Hotrlever were In col
llslon during a hurricane off Carllngfor
1-ouKh, off the coast of Ireland. Early re
ports said there were 300 passengers on the
Connemara, but a telegram from the super
intendent of the London and Northwestern
Hallway, owners of the vessel, received thla,
nfternoon, says that there were only fifty
seven passengers, all British subjects, on
board, noth steamships sank before life
boats could be lowered.
Only one survivor is reported thus far.
A man named lloyle, a member or the Re-,
tr(ever' crew, miraculously escaped death.
Ho brought back tho story of the greatest
sea disaster since the sinking of the Lusl
tanla and prevented the disappearance of
tho two ships, with their passengers and
crew, from becoming an untold mystery.
Only fragmentary reports of the disaster
had reached London this afternoon. From
these accounts It appears that the Conne
mara, n ferry liner of the London and
Northwestern Hallway Line, left Orcenore,
Ireland, at about dusk yesterday evening
for Holyhead, England, and collided with
the Inward-Aound steamship Retriever a
few miles off the Irish coast
Tho Connemara was carrying fifty-one
passengers. So far as known' here none of '
them was an American. Whether the IXe
trlevcr carried passengers Is not known.
Leaving Oreenore the ferry steamship
ran Into the teeth of a violent hurricane.
Plunglno along through the darknesa
and storm with even greater difficulty th
smaller Itetrlever, ihbound for her home
port ot Newry, In Carllngford Lough,
crnshed Into the Connemara. Apparently
few of the Conncmara's passengers had
retired when tho collision occurred.
Admiralty vessels were ordered to thi
scene of t?:a disaster to search for possible
victims. The majorityof the passengers.,
It Is stated, were men.
Later reports Indicate that the Retriever
LaJeo,(n)-wJthln a very few moments after,-' -"
I ff a n a n -am. J- -.- . - "' -. JitU
,...v..... wcm uuwn. -me tatter vessel .e
was owned by the London and NortwesttrA
nallway Company and was used for tha
transfer of passengers between England and
Ireland. '
Agents of the line were hopeful that the
list of saved might lie Increased when de
tails are known. This is believed doubtful.
however, as the early reports say that
the Connemara Bank bo quickly that it waa
impossible to lower her lifeboats and the
water was so cpld that there is virtually
no chance of any one surviving, even
though they were nble to attach life pre
servers before the vessel went down,
Reports from the scene of the disaster,
which Lloyd's places at a point off Car
llngford, Lough, on the Irish coast, IndlcaU
that the- collision took place In darkness,
the Retriever striking the Connemara almost
amidships and smashing her holds, so that
the water-tight gates were useless.
A dispatch from Dublin says that reports
received there say that bodies of the vic
tims are coming ashore on the coast of
County Down.
Unless survivors have been picked up by
the destroyers and coast-guard vessels sent,
