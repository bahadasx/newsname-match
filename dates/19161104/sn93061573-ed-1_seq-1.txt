INTEREST ON STATE LAND OFFICE MONEY FOR REPUBLICAN
CAMPAIGN PURPOSE81
What cto you think of that, Mr. Citizen T
Ovar $700,000 af money In tha handa of tha Republican Stata Land
Cemmlaaloner, en deposit in more than twenty banks, la not paying a cent -f
intereat to tha atate.
Just now tha question la, how much Interest la It paying th Repub
lican etate central committee for campaign pur poses T
Read thla and decide.
SOME DAYS AGO W. H GiLLEN WATER, REPUBLICAN STATE
CHAIRMAN, MADE WHAT WA8 IN EFFECT A DEMAND ON THE
PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE LEADING BANK8 OF THE STATE FOR
THE INTEREST ON THE STATE LAND OFFICE MO.MEY WHICH THE
BANK HAD ON DEPOSIT.
Ho told tha banker that aa the bank had had the use of money re
ceived by the 8tate Land Commissioner, the committee thought It ne
more than right that the bank ahould contribute to the Republican atate
committee an amount equal to what the Intereat on the money deposited
would be.
He went on to tr.y that In the event the contribution was made, tha
money would remain in the bank.
He didn't aay what would happen If the contribution wasn't made,
but the Inference waa strong.
The banker in question turned down the Gillenwater demand.. Ha
refused to pay earnings of State Land Office money Into the Republican
campaign fund.
But the question arlaes, how many of the twenty banka having money '
on deposit are paying Interest?
How much of the interest which the atate ahould be receiving la
going into the fund that Is being used In an attempt to saddle repudiated
Republican candidates on the people of New Mexico?
The money of the Etate Land Office constitutes a trust fund. It ia
derived from landa granted by the Federal government for the education
of the youth of New Mexico and the maintenance of institutions of the
commonwealth. , In large' part it la a heritage for the children of the
atate. '
FATHERS AND"MOTHERS OF NEW MEXICO, HOW DO YOU LIKE
THE IDEA OF YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL HERITAGE BEINGS
USED IN AN ENDEAVOR TO "PUT OVER" FRANK A. HUBBELL,
FAMOU8 8CHOOL VISITOR OF BERNALILLO COUNTY, AND H, O.
BURSUM, "VINDICATED" EX-PENITENTIARY WARDEN?
What do you think of a Land Commissioner who will un trust funds
Sacred 8chool Funda, If you will In that manner?
What do you think of party that frames auch methods?
WA8 THE CAMPAIGN FUND PLANNED?
A large part of the State Land Office money now on depoait In vari
oue banka waa paid Into the hands of the Land Commissioner by per
sons applying for the purchaar Of state landa, ae an advance en the pur
chase and a guarantee of good faith. And the Land Commissioner haa
arbitrarily taken the poaition that until the purchase Is consummated the
money doea not belong to the atate.
Some of the money haa bsen on depoait for aeveral years. Nona of It
haa ever returned a cent of interest to the state.
Haa tha Land Commissioner purposely taken the stand he haa, and
deprived the ateta of Interact on funda In his handa, ao that a Republican
campaign fund might be created?
In the light of the Gillenwater demand, can It not be aaaumed that
thla haa been the plan?
Concerning the question of the money advanced by proapectlve land
purchaser belonging to the state, Director A. E. Jamea, if the Taxpayers'
Association of New Mexico, haa given some Illuminating testimony. Fol
lowing a recent audit of the land office Mr. Jamea aald;
STATE DEPRIVED OF MONEY.
"Reluctantly, we have come to the conclusion that neither the facta
nor the law warrant the present manner of handling -he Land Depart
ment funda. Te thla conclusion we have arrived for the following rea
sena: "1. If tha Commissioner haa any right whatever to reeelve the do
pes Its demanded pending sale It la only becauae of hia (tutherlty aa Com
missioner. For thla reason, whether the state can perfect title or- not,
whether refunda can lawfully be made or not, the funds) ao reoelved are
state funda and ahould be, under the law, In the cuatedy of the State
Treasurer. . .
"2. The fact that the atate would be bound by the contract te refund,
If the Commissioner haa any right to make auch a contract, atlll further
stamps these funda aa etate funda and te be aafefluardtid In the manner
prescribed by law.
"J. In their present manner of disposal theee funda are uneafe. The
. Cemmlaaloner la under bond of only $50,000 and except aa he may try ta
protect himself the etate la unprotected agalnat a bank failure er an em.
. beixlement, except aa to only aeven per eent of the funds held.
"4. The present manner of handling the land funda daprivee the
state of an Income from deposits or otherwise to which It le entitled.
"8. IN THE HANDS OF A COMMISSIONER DISPOSED TO MAKE
POLITICAL USE OF THESE FUNDS A DEP08IT ACCOUNT OF
$700,000 COULD BE 8UBJECT TO SERIOUS ABUSE."
BURSUM PREPARED THE WAY.
. Had New Mexico been provided with a constitution effectively aafe
guarding publlo funda it would have baen Impossible for the Republican
Land Commissioner te have deprived the etate of the interest on funda In
his handa.
... Who ia responsible for the fact that auch an effective constitutional
provision doss not exist?
Here are a few enlightening facta:
During the Constitutions! Convention the Committee' on Taxatlen and
Revenue tentatively adopted, by an almoat unanlmoua vete, articles taken
from the constitution of another atate and recommended to the committee
by a prominent lawyer, who called the commlttee'a attention to the faot
that theee articles had been tried and approved, and that they compelled
all public officials, State, County and City, to depoait fur le In their handa
In banka, the Intereat on these funds to accrue to ttie benefit of the
people.
After thla action waa taken by the committee, H. O, Buraum appeared
on the acene and objected atrenuoualy to tha adoption of tha articles In
question, and after a hard fight, a aubatltute, which waa recommended aa
"Juat aa good," waa adopted by tha committee.
The fight waa taken to the floor of the convention, where Mr. Buraum
again won out, defeating the articlee, which, had thiy been adopted,
would have secured for the people of the atate in toree t on all publlo funda.
At that time some of the members of tha committee could not under
stand Bureum'e action. Now, however, In view of the action of hie state
chairman. It appears that he waa almpty looking ahead.
Mr. Buraum, In the Constitutional Convention, made poaaible the
present situation.
HE MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR MONEY WHICH THE STATE
SHOULD RECEIVE WHICH THE CHILDREN OI THE STATS
SHOULD RECEIVE TO BE USED IN HIS FIGHT TO GAIN CONTROL
OF NEW MEXICO FOR THE REPUBLICAN RING.
IS THIS THE MAN YOU WANT FOR GOVERNOR?
GAMBLERS ADMIT RUIN IF SKEL-1
TON IS ELECTED
The cat is out of the bag) From
mouth to mouth, or the. bar aod
around the corner, the word is be
ing pawed by the puiiblers snd the
gambling interests of Clayton.
"GET BKELTON..
No matter bow you vote, is tho
word being passed., over tho bar
and around the corner, no matter
which ticket you vole, get Skelton.
Over the card tables, in darkened
rooms, on the streets at night, any
where away from the light of day
the gamblers and their backers and
protectors are stalking with the
message "Get Skelton."
Too cowardly to publish that mes
sage, too sneaking to manfully stand
up for their profession and let it
become an issue that the people may
know a vote -against Skelton is a
vote for a continuation of gambling
and vice, the pimps, the todies, the
courtesans, the saloon hangers on,
and even rl.h men who are not
these things but have invested in
)usiness that produce such creatures
aro spreading their lies. Over tho
bar, in dark rooms, on the streets
after night, in the alloys at dusk
"CET SKELTON."
"Pecause," pay th'y, "Skelton will
uin our business."
'Beciui.se," they say, "we ca.raol
pay our dents uiuess our genteel
robbery of tho public is 'protected."
AND SKELTON WON'T PRO
TECT US."
Across the card tables, over the
bar, in the alleys at dusk, on the
streets at iughtr-"GET SKELTON."
But the clean, honorable voters of
Union county, regardless of politic
al beliefs, regardless of race and
regardless of rwilatms, are not go
ing to bUohI idly by end see a lean
honorable candidate for the oíllcí
í.f sheriff be butchered at the polls
to make a Human Holiday.
