me, a growing tide of sentiment," he

very well what polities are essential to
their welfare. They are not likely to
be deceived by an delusive statements
with rspect to peace or prosperity.
"There will be no lasting peace J the
nation's honr is not maintained. There
is no lasting security unless American
rights are fearlessly maintained
throughout the world.
Hot Path to War.
"That is not thiLatjLio war; that is
the way to maintain our self-respect.
Rights cease to be rights if tliey are
not enforced. It is not that we should
have a policy of aggression; it is not
that we should make a braggart as
sertion of our claims ; that wc should
go through the world boastful or
truculent, but it iv?hat wherever our
flag flies, the AinVrican citizen, who
is lawfully pursuing his work, should
know that it is the symliol of full pro
tection to him, exercising his rights
wherever he may happen to be, whether
it is on land or on the high seas."
