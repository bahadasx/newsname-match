in Emphatic Words at New

Chicago, Nov. 4.Frank H. Hitch
cock today added Ohio and Wisconsin
to the list of states he figures are
safely Republican, placed Missouri
and Kentucky in the tabulation of
"sure, but not quite safe" states for
Hughes, and maintained the claim
that he issued Saturday that the Re
publican national ticket is to carry
the bulk of states in the north and
west.
On the Ifcsis of his new figures, Mr.
Hitchcock reiterated his expectation
that Hughes will carry New York
state by at least 100,000 and Connec
ticut he figured as absolutely assured
to the Republican candidate.
"Ohio I now consider safely "as-
sured to the Republicans," he con
tinued. ^'Conditions that weje^giv-
stiaping
themselves rapidly within the last
few days. Indiana has been safe for
some lme Wisconsin I find to be in
much better shape than has been gen
erally believed, even in our own head
quarters.
"Through the middle west Hughes
has been gaining continuously during
the last ten days.
"On the Pacific coast the difference
that existed in Washington has been
adjusted satisfactorily, and that state,
Oregon and California unquestionably
will be Republican."

Indianapolis. Nov. 4.Albert J.
Beveridge, in denouncing the Demo
cratic claims of progressive legisla
tion, last night said:
"We find that not one line of con
structive law pnssed during the last
four years was written by a Demo
cratic pen or originated in a Demo
cratic brain. Every one of them was
proposed and fought for by Progres
sives or Republicans, and for years
every one of them was opposed by
principles both by the party In power
as a party and by the head of their
political administration and a student
and thinker."
New York, Nov. 4.Colonel Theo
dore Roosevelt criticized President
Wilson in emphatic words last night
in an address at Cooper Union, which
he delivered at the request of a cam
paign organization of business men
who opposed the re-election of Mr.
Wilson. Taking as his subject, "Our
Nation's Crisis," Colonel Roosevelt
said that a world cataclysm has over
whelmed civilization and that "the
times have needed a Washington or
a Lincoln, but unfortunately we have
been granted only another Buchan-
an."
"I have been assailed," said the
speaker, "because I have criticized
Mr. Wilson. I have not said one
thing of him that was not absolutely
accurate and truthful. I have criti
cized him because I believe he has
dragged in the dust what was the
most sacred in our past, and has
jeopardized the most vital hopes of
our future. In the face of the world
he has covered this nation's face with
shame as with a garment.
"I hardly know whether to feel
the most burning indignation and
those speeches of htm wherein he ex
presses lofty sentiments which his
deeds belle, or at those other speeches
where he displays frank cynicism
and appeals to what is basest in the
human heart."

By ROY HOWARD
(President of United Press)
New York, Nov. 4.Nowhere in
England, France or Germany is there
the slightest evidence of the ap
proaching end of the war. No coun
try indicates that there will possibly
be an end to the struggle within two
years. There are innumerable indi
cations that the end will be farther
off.
Washington Nov. 4. Officials
frankly admit that they are puzzled
about the status of the Deutschland.
Should reports that a fighting sub
marine would convey thj Deutschland
back to Germany prove correct, it Is
believed in some circles that if the
two submarines act in concert it will
greatly strengthen the British con
tentions that all submarines should
be suspicioned.
