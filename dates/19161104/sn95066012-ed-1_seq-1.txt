HUGHES ENDORSED
BY RECORD, SAYS
ROOSEVELT
Appeals to Voters to Support For
mer New York Governor
NO FIFTY - FIFTY AMERICANS
Cooper Union Audience Told There
is Room in This Country for Only
One Kind of Citizens
New York, Nov, 4. Theodore Roose
velt, speaking at a mass-meeting in
Cooper union last night, denounced
the policies of the Wilson administra
tion and urged his audience to "put in
the presidential chair the clean and
upright justice of the supreme court,
and fearless former governor of New
York, whose whole public record has
been that of a man straighl'orward in
his thought and courageous in his ac
tions, who cannot be eontroled to do
what is wrong and who will do what
is right no mattor what Influences
may be brought against him." The
former president broke avay from his
speech which he had perpared in ad
vance, to say what he thought of the
so-called "hyphenates." He declared
that although Washington and Liu
coln were oi English blood, they wire
both Americans through and through.
"Ho American can he a good Ameri
can on a fifty-fifty basis," said Mr.
Roosevelt. "There is no room in this
country for English-Americans, Ger-man-Anierlcans
French-Americans,
Irish-Americans or any other kind of
Americans but real Americans."
Mr. Roosevelt, in relerring to Sec
retary of war llukers's recent alleged
comparison of Washingon's soldiers
with the constitutionalist forces in
Mexico, said Mr. Huktr was "an amia
ble man who knits."
New York, Nov. 4. Charles K.
Hughes went into independent Kings
County last night and told three en
thusiastic meetings that he would be
elected President next Tuesday be
cause the people of the country had
made up their minds to vote for a
protective tariff and Americanism.
The Brooklyn speeches came at the
end of a busy day in which a cam
paigned down the Hudson Valley and
was received everywhere by . large
crowds.
The close of the Republican cam
paign comes tonight, when Mr.
Hughes will speak in Madison Square
Garden.
The Republican candidate, in his
speeches last night, made the strong
est sort of appeal for the support of
the Workingman, devoting his great
est energies to painting a word pic
ture of a jobless, disconsolate Ameri
ca after the war unless the country
has the high tariff he and his party
offer. The high spot of the day's cam
paigning was when he stood before
2,000 workers down on Greenpoint,
where he lived as a boy, and asked:
"Which do you want, reduction of
wages or 'protection of wages?
Answer me!"
Like a single voice came the roar:
"We want protection!"
.In all of this three Brooklyn speech
es. Mr. Hughes said that he had been
a friend of labor when he was Gover
nor of New York, and promised he
would not change if elected President.

the loft wheel and spring struck the
animal and ran over him.
He was evidently badly injured.
There was no knife of sufficient siz
and strength in the party with which

honor with the two distinguished sons
of Vermont and rode in state to New

animal into his keeping. Mr. Alexan

RUTLAND COUNTY
GREETS FORMER
PRESIDENT
One of the Biggest Ralfies in His
tory of Marble City
SCORES WILSON'S BLUNDERS
Horace F. Graham, Republican Candi'
date for Governor, Discussed
State Issues.
Rutland, Nov. 3. Rutland county
gave a rousing reception to ex-President
Taft here tonight when the re
publican campaign came to a close
with the biggest rally the city ever
saw. Fifteen hundred people gather
ed at the Shrine theatre of the audl
toiium prevented hundreds more attending.-
Mr. Taft was the guest at dinner of
Frank C. Partridge of Proctor and
when he reached the city by motor
car he was escorted to the theatre by
the band. An orchestra played patrio
tic airs whll the crowd was assembl
ing. As ex-President Taft arraigned tl.c
Democratic party for their blunders
and criticized Wilson's administration
he was interrupted frequently by ap
plause tin horns and rattles increasing
the din of many voices.
The speakers were introduced by
Attorney Walter S. Fenton, republican
candidate for city representative.
Horace Graham, republican candidate
for governor, gave a talk on domestic
affairs. He outlined the policies for
the State to pursue in the next two
years, recommending doing the best
we can with what money we have and
not increasing the taxation of the pre
ple. Many women were in the au
dience. '
Declaring that the campaign of 1916
is as important as the campaign of
18!f and resembles that campaign in
that the Democratic party and its can
didate are seeking a vote of power for
reason, the former president of the
distlngenuous, unsonn, but alluring
United States, assailed the Democra
tic party's fiscal policy, its extrava
gance. Its free trade tariff, its claim
to credit' for prosperity and its for
eign policy, and he made a direct re
ply to President Wilson's defense of
his course in settling the threatened
railroad strike through the enactment
cl the Adamson law.
Montpelier, November 4. "The Re
publican campaign in Vermont will be
continued up to the eve before elec
tion day," said Chairman Wilson of
the Republican State Committee to
day, and he added: "It has been a
most satisfactory campaign in every
respect."
"The campaign has been one large
ly of speaking, with tour distinguished
men Bent to the State by the Repub
lican National Committee', Hon. Wade
H. Ellis of Ohio. Hon. B. M. Fernald,
Senator-elect of Maine, Hon. H. D. Es
tabieiok of New York, one of the most
finished speakers in political cam
paigning in the country, und ex-Presi
dent William Howard Taft. There
have been twenty-one local speakers
on the stump since the campaign
opened October 25th .and fifty-four
rallies will have been held when the
campaign is finished on the evening
of November 0th. All of these rallies
have been largely attended and much
enthusiasm shown.
Among the speakers whose services
were voluntarily given to tho Commit
tee, and who have made several ad
dresses during the campaign, are
Senator William P. Dillingham, Con
gressmen Porter H. Dale, and Frank
L. Greene, Ex Lie ulenant Governor
Frank E. Howe, John T. dishing, Edi
tor 'of. the St. Albans Messenger, and
Dr. J. II. Blodgett. To these gentle
men and all others who have particl
in making the campaign a success, the
State committee extends Its grateful
thanks.
"It was the prevailing opinion
among students of politics in the
State that little or no interest could
be aroused in a campaign where there
was no contest for State offices and
few contests for town representatives
or State senators," said Chairman W1I
son, "This opinion was quite natural
iii view of the fact that the contests
cume in the September primary, and
tho prediction was frequently made
that the campaign the Sta to Commit
tee proposed to conduct would fall like
a wet blanket from the line, but it is
most gratifying to announce that
these predictions were wide of the
mark, and the outcome of the cam
paign is sure to please every true
Republican In the Stnte."
"It is my firm belief that the vote
on November 7th will be of tne old
time order and the Republican majori
ty will hp heralded country-wide us
showing Vermont still staunch and
firm in her Republicanism."

Sheriff Godfrey of Bennington !
county, keeper of the Jail, probably?
owes his life to the bravery of his
wife who came t to his assistance
and beat off a powerful prisoner who
iu his attempt to escape was about
to crush the officer. And it is not the
first time by any means that similar
incidents have happened. The posi
tion of the jailor's wife requires often
as much nerve and quick, wit and
l'ucllity iu wielding a weapon as does
that of the Jailer himself. Rutland
