He who entertains the somewhal
prevailing notion that the practice of
religion Is chiefly, If not alone, among
women, should attend the nightly mis
sionary scrvlcea at the 8t. Patrick
church to be undeceived. We hear of
a Oo-To-Church-Sunday in which It
Is desired to "round up" the stay-at-homes
who are supposed to be chlfly
men, once a year; but not one night
but every night of the week and sev
eral limes during the day large con
gregations of men are to he MM In at
tendance at the spacious Catholic edi
fice, corner Third and Limestone, en
tering into the minutest detail of re
ligious worship with a wliole-soultTess
truly remarkable in this community
Delng Interviewed on 'he subject of
the religious activities of the men of
his parish, the beloved pastor of St
Patrick's, Rev. P. M. Jones, to a rep
resentative of the Public Ledger said:
"Yes, the attendance of men at the
Mission, from its very opening, has
MM most satisfying. The good mis
sionary fathers from Chicago, engaged
In giving the Mission, as well as oth
ers, have expressed their edification In
beholding so many men approai -li in .
the Sacrements each day, nnd at their
Intense earnestness in evnylliing per
taining to the Mission. Whilst tar
city slumbers, before day break, large
concourses of my people are daily tr
he found In our church, brought
thither by purely religious motives.
No better or more deserving nen are
t be found nnywhere than ri ;ht here
in our city. None more ready to make
sacrifices for their religion. ; convie
tlons." "Hut, Father Jones." the Ledger man
interrogated, "Is not this daily out
pouring of men at your services ex
traordinary?" "Yes." was the ready response: "a
mission is a time of extraordinary ef
fort to "line up" with the spirit of the
gospel, during which my people in
large numbers attend. Dut in this
church, at no time, are we haunted by
the specter of the "Kmpty Pew." At
every servlco throughout the year, es
pecially at the Sunday morning ser
vices, the attendance is always repre
sentative of the largest and most pros
perous congregation In .North-astern
Kentucky."
"Before taking your leave," Father
Jones sinlllingly added with a cordial
ly distinctively his own: "I must ex
press my gratification at beholding so
many of our esteemed citizens not of
our faith in attendance at our ser
vices, particularly at our evening ser
vices. The doctrines of Mother
Church are ao much misunderstood
that those who seek to be set aright
M to Catholic teachings are always
heartily welcomed at our service. The
Church has no doctrine to which it
can not and does not gladly invite the
closest scrutiny of inquiring minds.
Assure all, through the columns of the
Public ledger, that a cordial welcome
to attend the service at this Church Is
at all times extended."
