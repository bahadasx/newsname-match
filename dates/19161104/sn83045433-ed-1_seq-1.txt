WILSON POLCIES
T. R. Makes Bitter Attack an
Dance OLWords."
(ly the laternat"mal News servis.)
Now York, NovL-CoL Theodore Roose
volt and IM of his admirers had a bet
tyfe at Cooper Union tonight .amg
Woodrow Wilson. The Colonel 0cnen
ttd everything be had said before
about the President during the campaign
into this final speech, and then said some
new thing
"Hit 'em again, Teddy." shouted the
crowd at his hardest knocks, and every
tme the Colisel grinned, and did "hit
'em agan."
Very little was said about Mr. Hughes.
Jehn Wanamaker. who pesded, spoke
of kim more times in his talk of twenty
minuts than the Colonel did in. bi. talk
Of mere than an hour. From appear
Sano, the Colonel might have been the
Lineln in Evidenee.
One thing in certain, the Republicans
and l)emocrate alike arm unanimous for
Abrhamin Lincoln. The night before
President Wilson was likened right to his
face to Abraham Incoln, and he did not
d0y it. Attention was called to the
tablet, over the President's head, com
mmmratng Lincoln's famous Cooper
Ulion speech. A
Tonight, the managers of the Roosevelt
meeting did the thing much better. They
had the hall profusely deeogtd with
bunting, which the Tam an~ all com
mittee did not do for Wilson.~ "hey had
a portrait of I-ncoln behind the speak
erb *stand. and two huge plaster busts
of Lincoln on either side. They brought
out for the occasion the old reading desk
and the chair which Lincoln used when
he Made his great speech.
The crowd was quite different in ap
pearanes from the Wilson meeting of the
night before. There were many in even
Ing clothes. and one-fifth at least of the
audience was women, including some of
the Roosevelt family. On the stage were
many Old Guard Republicans and George
W. Perkins to represent the returned
Progressives. There was not a heckler in
the crowd. I
When Col. Roosevelt entered the crow-i
cheered him for seven minutes. four more
than the crowd cheered Wilson the night
tefore Cries of "We want Teddy" made
the Colonel smile. The cheers were taken
uP outside the hall by thousands in the
street.
1ee1 Period of Pert.
Mr. Wanamaker spoke for the busi
ness interests of the country in intro
ducing the Colonel.
"I believe, and many business men
helleve," he said, "that a period of
peril and distress threatens this na
g, tion on account of the Wilson policies.
I believe the Republican party, which.
under God4, saved the metimW-Aflt
yeaT ag. ilW~l ayo t6 save it now
from being plungod into a esatury of
indebtednem.."
Col. Roosevelt was cheered for an
nther minute when he began to speak.
His scornful references to Mr. Wilson
as another Buchanan made the crowd
yell with delight, and when he said
the President resembled a horse In the
middle of a stream that "moved feebly
forward and feebly backward and oe
casionally lies down." they cheered for
a minute and cried "hit him again."
Several new phrases of the Colonel's
attacking the President delighted the
crowd. "Shadow dance of words," "Span
stled shroud of - rhetoric.," "Sordid un
truths,". "He passes for a man of learn
ing," "Veil of rhetorical phrases,', made
them cheer again and again.
His excoriation of the President for
saytg "You cannot worship God on an
empty stomach.," roused the greatest ap
plause In his address. There was another
demonstration at his pictures of Ameri
can troopers masmeWsd by Mexicans, the
crowd an thd floor and the people on the
stage rising in spontaneous -.salute to
him, and cheering him for a minute.

CLINCH VICTORY
French Advance to Vaux Vil-I
lage and Hold Heights.
By C. F. BERTECLLI.
(Internatienal News Service.)
Paris. Nov. 3.-sGen. Nivelle crowned
the greatest positive French victory of
the war yesterday evening when lie oc
cupied Fort Vaux. the last of the Verdun
strongholds occupied by the Germana.
That it was a bloodless triumph Is due
rot to German generosity in yielding an
undesired position, but to the awful gun
fire to which the famous ridge was sub
jected.
.The French today enlarged their sue
cesses by a series of brilliant attacks
which. the midnight communique an
nounces. hom enabled them to advance as
far as Vaux vilage besides winning a foot
hold on the hill which dominates the vil
lage. The Germans made no effort to
counter-attack.
The day was quiet on the Somme fol
lowing the French successes of earlier
in the week in the sector of L"s Boeuft
and Sailly-Saillisel.
The occupation of Fort Vaux marks the
first great tactical triumph won In the
whole war without the.lons of life. And
the explanation therefor is France's de
velopment in gun powder.
Technically. Fort Vaux was rendered
untenable when a fortnight ago Gen.
Mangin seized Douaumont Jhd drove a
wedge between that fort ani the village
of Vaux. The result was to expose Vaux
fort to a converging fire. but the fort was
in precisely the same position as during
last May and June, yet at that time Maj.
Rlaynal held up the crown prince's ad
vance for a month and Inflicted terrible
slaughter on the German assailants be
fore capitulating. The capture of Fort
Vaux alone cost the Germans 1,010 per

Neither Davidson nor Sabin would. Ia
advanct of the conference. discuss the
possibility of the tnited States on a
gold basis. having to face the three pow
erful nations on a silver baxts. But Hearv
D. Baker. former commercial attache at
Petrograd, speaking unoffleially. said that
he did not believe that the members of
the entente would take such a drnstic
step. e said:
"1 am sure that the allies would do
nothing which outild injute the tand
ing of their securities. To do A,, would
only prevent the obtaining of further
funds. The question of cetting all the
money they need in th. 'nited States is
only one of interest rate. Thee' never
wes more money to invest than in the

greater demand for good bonds.
