GERMANY MAKES
A NEWRUL1NG
Must Have Positive Guarantee
That Cargoes Shall Not Be
Landed for British.
London, Nov. 4, 5:13 a, m. A spe
cial dispatch from Amsterdam fea
tures a dispatch of tho Berlin Kruz
Zeitung to the effect that Germany
has decided to make the safety of
neutral ships carrying neutral cargoes
dependent upon guarantees that no
part of such cargoes shall bo landed,
whether through British compulsion
or not, at any British port.
Such guarantees, according to the
Kruz Zeitung, can consist in only for
mal undertakings by Great Britain and
only such an undertaking will be rec
ognized by Germany from case to
case.
This is taken to mean that in event
of any neutral cargo or part therefore
being landed in England, tho German
government immediately will cease to
recognize the inviolability of neutral
ships. Tho Berlin paper implies that
the case of the Dutch freighter Bloom
ersdijk, which was sunk by a German
submarine off Nantucket, October 8,
will be argued along these lines and
It will be contended since tho Inter
mediate destination of the vessel was
Kirkwall there was no guarantee that I
the whole cargo would reach Holland.
The British press also infers from
a Berlin dispatch, summarized in the
Koelnische Zeitung, that Germany
proposes to sink all neutral ships,
where bearing neutral cargoes or oth
erwise, unless Great Britain consents
to disband to compel the discharge
of any part of a neutral cargo sus
pected of having an enemy destina
tion. oo
BUSINESS DEMANDS1
OUTRUN PRODUCTION
r
New York, Nov. 3. Dunn's Review
says:
"Neither the pending elections nor
the persistent rise of prices have per.
cepCibly reduced the momentum of the
business movement. New buying for
current and forward requirements still
outstrips the facilities for both pro
duction and distribution, labor condi
tions and the growing scarcity of ma
terials acting as a brake on manufac
turing in many directions. Car short
ages are also a hindrance and the con
sequent restriction of fuel supplies
causes some concern. With shipments
generally backward and the trend of
prices continuing strongly upward,
producers display greater reluctance
in extending commitments and an
increasing- number of profitable con
tracts are being- rejected. Weekly

the approaching American election,
reprinting summaries of the. situation
from old English newspapers. The
Catholic organ, the Koelnische Volks
Zeitung, today devoted a lengthy edi
torial to the subject, but studiously
avoided taking sides. If Germans at
one time, it says, sided with one of
the candidates because they assumed
that he was more friendly to Germany,
they now see their mistake.
The Frankfurter Zeitung also prints
a leading editorial expressing the
opinion that the outcome of the elec
tion is very much in doubt. It treats
with great sympathy President Wil

through a peace organization estab
lished through propaganda of the

BULLETIN OUTLINES
OCTOBER BUSINESS
Washington, Nov. 3. Outstanding
features of the October business and
financial situation, cited by the fed
eral reserve bulletin today, were con
tinuatlonof heavy exports and of the
net inward gold shipment, extended
domestic trade activity, rising prices,
easy money rates and full employ
metn of labor. Heavy balances due
from Europe it Is stated have given
riso to demands for new financing a
feature of which, of especial concern
to the federal reservo system, is the
extensive resort to the ubo of accep
tance credits arranged, pr to be ar
ranged, on behalf of industrial and
commercial borrowers in' Europe.
The often predicted slackening or
reversal of the gold movement in thh
country has shown no indication of
developing to the present date, the
bullotln says., Official statistics show
that to the middlo of October the net
inwardd movement or gold, .since Jan
uary 1 was approximately $204,000,000
against $200,0000,000 for the corre
sponding period in 1915.
"The only symptom of a change in
tho international position of the
United States as respects gold," the
bulletin adds, "Is found In an increase
in the gross exportation of tho metal
from the beginning of the year to the
middlo of October, bringing the total
f
outflow to about $96,000,000, against
$13,000,000 the same period of 1916."

DEUTSCHLAND NOT
TO BE CONVOYED
Reports That U-57 Is Here to
Guard Merchant Submarine
Not Confirmed.
Washington, Nov. 4. Reports that
the Deutschland will bo convoyed back
to Germany by the war submarine
U-57 have not been confirmed here
officially and in some quarters such
a step is regarded as improbable as
it has contended that a convoyed ship
takes on the war-like character of
her convoy and cannot claim the Im
munities of a peaceful merchantman.
Whether the visit of a second war
submarine might bo taken by the
state department as offering oppor
tunity to request Germany not to con

can coast is in tho hands of Secre

BULL HUES
CITY'S STREETS
Somebody's bull Is at larg(j a large
brindle bovine about 2 years old, with
crumpled horns, evidently a pampered
prince of his tribe. He romped and
rlpsnorted playfully, to the terror of
timid young women on their way to
work, across and around Lester park
at 7 o'clock this morning, and when
last seen still was there eyeing the
passing throng.
Observing the fright of several
young women, who foaredt o pass by
the creature, a local scribe threw peb
bles at him until they had safely
passed. This didn't feazfq him a mite,
however, but he snorted lnr disdain,
pawed tho earth, throwing high tho
soil and took several threatening stops
forward.
From the defiant attitude of tho
young women, who feared to paBs by
It was plain that his capture would re
quire the services of a fast bronco and
