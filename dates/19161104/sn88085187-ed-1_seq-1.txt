For nearly a quarter of a cen

Atkins recently decided to s.\f

they won't even sell a drink to
their best friends.
Police Chief Harry 11. Smith
has been in office since Sept. It
In this brief period he has con
ducted 34 raids on blind pigs and
resorts where liquor was sold il
legally. In only four cases has
he failed. In each of these fourl
instances, whisky was found in
small quantities hut it was pro
tected by legal permits.
These raids have added 11,318
to the treasury in the form of
fines and forfeited balls.
Would Make It Felony.
Fifteen victims have received
jail sentences, most of them for
a month's period.
And from now on, the police
judge has agreed to give jail ien
tences to all violators, rather than
cash fines.
Chief Smith intends to go be
fore the next legislature and ask
for a state law making illicit sell
ing of booze a felony.
Smith has a capable cor,i3 of
special investigators working di
rectly out of his own office.
Working (hit of a Job.
"These blind piggers are just
getting the fact that I mean litisi

"When I first took office, it .vas
comparatively easy to make raids.
But during the last week or so,
theY have been going out of busi
ness so fast that my investigators
are having a hard time to 'iv.l

Tacoma was a fine oasis for the
