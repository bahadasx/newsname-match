WHAT BECAME
OF SENATOR
CHASJWNE?
By the way, what became of Sen
a'tor Charley Towne, the silver tong
ued New Yorker that was coming to
-Logan to answer Senator Corah? Wc
mean Charley Towne who introduced
Frank J. Cannon to an eastern audi
ence as an unselfish gentleman who
had sacrificed much for the good of
the ignorant, immoral people of
Utah. Somehow Charley Towne was
given a "floater" in the "twinkling of
an eye." The Journal has' had much
to say and has taken a number of
"fits" "on account of Miss Todd's
JSljt presence in the county, but as be
,,JP twecn.. JheAw there's a difference
Miss Todd is a lady and a friend of
I Utah. Charley Towne's sudden dc
I parturc from the State is sufficient
I to determine what he is. As a mat-
tcr of fact, the Republicans bring
Utah's friends to talk to her people.
Whom do the Democrats bring?

DEMOCRATS TO
VOTEJVISELY
Itensons Why Ex-ComniUMonpr Cron-
qulst Cannot Supixirt IJer-
geson and Facer.
Editor Logan Republican:
I have been Informed that Mr.
E. II. Owen mado an attack on mo
at a Democratic meeting recently
hold at Trenton, In which he stated
that I was a Itopubllcan and asked
tho votors to disregard any state
ments I might mako relittve to can
didates seeking ro-electlon. I believe,
tho public generally understand my
politics without comment from Mr.
Owen or any other person. I have,
howover, somo very pointed reasons
to give to the public why Commis
sioners Facer' and Bergeson should
not bo re-elected as County Commis
sioners of this county. They1 aro as
follows: First, I cannot support
them becauso under tholr supervi
sion the assessment of property In
Cache, County Is the most Inequit
able and unjust assessment during
my acquaintance with public affairs;
that great discrimination and Injus
tice has been shown In the' assess
ment of the same class and value of
property, apparently becauso one tax
payor was a political supporter of
the Commissioners and tho other was
not. Hundrods ot examples of In
equality and glaring discriminations
can be shown, somo of which aro as
follows:
A resident of North Logan Is as
sessed at $ 3700.00 for a twenty acre
tract of land, or $185.00 per' acre,
whllo his neighbor across the street,
has a tract assessed at $77.00 per
aero. The two tracts are as nearly
similar 'In quality and grade as pos
sible.' "
One person in North Logan with
18 acres of land Is assessed 260.00
per aero whllo his neighbor Is asses
sed with a 2C-acro tract at tho rate
of $155.00 per acre. Both tracts
should be assessed at the same rate.
Another Instance of Inequality ap
pears In Smlthflold. A tract of 14.30
acres Is assessed at $60.00 per aero
whllo another Individual Is assessed
with 20.63 acres at $40.00 per acre,
tho latter tract being worth at least
one-third moro por acre than the
first tract.
Carl Nyman of North Logan Is as
sessed with ten acres of land at $132
por aero while his neighbor ncross
tho street south with tho samo am
ount ot land Is assessed only at $00
por acre. Both tracts nro of the samo
grado nud'qunllty. ?
Christian P. Hanson of North Lo
gan Is assessed with 13,85 ucre3 at
tho rate of $155 per aero. This
tract Is mostly meadow and hay land
and woul bo assessed enough If It
woro cut sqarely' In two. Those are
only u few of tho cases I could mon
tlon. I am against them becauso thoy
hnvo cut tholr own taxes whllo not
ing In tholr official capacity and have
ralsod tholr own salaries when thoy
woro rocolvlng sufficient compensa
tion for tholr sorvlcos.
I am for a fair deal to ovory tax
payor In tho County without fear or
favor and am opposed to such glar
ing discriminations as havo marked
tho present Democratic administra
tion. It apparontly has not shown
tho alllty to haudlo tho affairs of a
groat County Hko Cacho In conse
quence ot which I ask my friends to
Join with mo and tho Itopubllcans
for tho dofat of Commissioners Fac
or and Bergeson.

TO COMMISSIONERS
FACER AND BERGESON
SOME FACER AND BERGESONISMS
To Commissioners Facer and Ber
geson: It Is not a fact that In the 700
acre Ephrlom Bergeson tract which
you claim he has paid $4.00 per aero
for, and upon which you lowored his
taxes to $4.00 per acre, that about
50 acres is good cultivated land and
produces about 30 bushels of wheat
per acre?
It It not a fact that In your futile
attempts at explanation and compar
ison you strained yourself to pick
land Inferior to Mr. Bergeson's In
order to strike as low a tax limit?
Why did you not include In your
comparison the Butler tract of 160
acres, and other tracts of like char
acter, which is assessed moro than
the Bergeson tract and which com
pares favorably In quality and value?
Why do you not offer somo explana
tion for lowering tho taxes of the
brothers of Commissioner Bergeson?
Do you think It a wise pollcya
fair policy, or just to your constitu
ents to lower taxes ot Commissioner
Bergeson and his brothers as tho re
cords show thoy have been lowored,
thus repudiating tho work of your
own assessors and deputies?
Is It not a fact that you Insisted
upon and did raise valuations in
general on form property through
out tho County over the protest of
the County Assessor?
Is It fair to assess a city lot In
Smlthfleld owned by tho Miles estate,
real. estate, only,' that has hitherto
been assessed at $1000.00 at $800.00
and then assess a city lot, real es
tato only, Just across the street, the
homo of Robert Grlfllths at $26007
Will you kindly tell tho tax payers
how many County automobiles you
have worn out during the past two
years and the expenses Incident
thereto and for what purposes they
have been usod? Do you rldo on
passes and at tho samo time draw
tho full amount allowed by law to
cover your actual traveling oxponse? I

Tho law allows you $300.00. Havo
you drawn It?
Why did you raise your own salar
ies from $500.00 to $600.00 per an
num when you aro receiving ade
quate compensation for all services
performed?
Is It not a fact that you have moro
deputies In the various olllces than
nro absolutely necessary to do tho
work? Aro thoso creations for the
purpose of passing out political Jobs
at tho expense of tho tax payers?
Is It not truo thai you havo failed
to properly supervise tho work of
the County ofllcers and tho deputies
with a view to reducing taxation and
securing efflclcnt service?
Did you give .the County Recorder
the support you should havo dono
when tho recent trouble-broke out
In her office-? Does she have too
many deputies, and lf,so, why did
you not weed" them out? Is It not a
fact that you recently askod her to
sign a statement to tho effect that
youhad treated her fairly and dono
alliyou could to support her, and did
she" not refuse to sign such a state
ment? Was there over a bridge across
Bear River known as Cornish Brld
go? Is that bridge still thero, and
If not, what became of It? Was It
ever advertised and sold according
toJlaw?
.These are some of tho queries that
havo been submitted to this ofllco by
tax payers throughout tho county.
Therajs tlmoJor you to answer them
for which we offer space. You will
agree with us that a satisfactory an
swer will, to say tho least, not bo
against your re-election, whllo an un
satisfactory answer will bo good rea
sons why you should bo defeated.
Theso are somo hard nuts for you to
crack. Kindly crack thorn If you can

where there Is smoke there must be

you, but wo do demand that you bo
I fair with thoso whom you represent.

-jil i " !

County Treasurer, Geo. S. Dailies,
has been nominated by the Republi
can party as his own successor. He
was elected two years ago on the
Democratic Progressive ticket pledg
ing its 'candidates to a program of
cccnomy. As an official he has liv
ed that program in cry deed. For
example by letting all printing jji
his office to bids, he paid $84.13 as
against $219.00 paid by his predeces
sor for the same work, by properly
balancing the two accounts in his
office the Treasurer's and the Col
lector'sand letting the accounts to
bids by the banks, he received as
interest on deposit $815.30 for 1915,
as against $296.84 received by his
prc-dcccssor in 1914; for extra help
he paid in 1915, $56085, as against
$928.00 incurred by his successor in
1914; he collected the uticollectablc
debts down to $857.90, while $2,011.87
slipped by uncollected in 1914, sav
ing in this item to the county $1,
153.88, making a total saved to
Cache County $358.00 over and above
his own salary and that of his dep
uty's. Lincoln J. Kelly, the State Auditor
has this to say of Mr. Dailies:
"I congratulate the people of Cache
county in having Geo. S. Daincs as
a candidate to succeed himself. Nev
er have the accounts in the Treasur
er's office been kept more accurately
nor in a more business like manner."
William J. Scelcy, the Deputy
State Auditor, who has personally
handled all the accounts with Mr.
Dailies, says:
"I wish particularly at this time to
commend Mr. Dailies for the manner
in which he has handled the 1915 tax
accounts ,and for the prompt and ef
ficient manner in which he has fol
lowed every suggestion for improve
ment made by the State Auditors
office."

A. M. ISRAELSEN
A. M. Israclscn, Republican candi
date for the Legislature, is a man
long identified with the development
of Cache Valley aud particularly the
South end. He is that type of stal
wart citizen that is always called in
to the breach when yeoman service
is needed. Mr. Israclscn is a man
of wide experience in public affairs,
having served two terms as county
commissioner, lie has always taken
an active interest in public affairs.
At the present time lie is a counselor
in the presidency of the Hyrum
stake. If elected, Mr. Israclscn will
be found looking after the interests
of Cache County, and will make his
presence in the legislative halls of
the capitol, felt by all.

Henry McCrackcn, Republican
candidate for the office of County
Clerk, is a man who needs little in
troduction to the voters of Cache

MORRIS AND I
THE LIQUOR J
INTERESTS ill
In the last issue of The Journal, ?! fl
Cache County citizens Were startled ! Mai
with a statement from Harry Stou- I 1H
cy to the effect that the saloon men
arc tor Morris, in consequence of P?H
which lie is losing Republican prohi- ' BnH
bitionists. To think of Mr. Daintier- , 'B
gcr losing the saloon men must have i .H
been a sad blow to Harry, The Jour- Bi.H
nal, likewise to Mr, Bamberger, k9
from the fact that Mr. Bamberger i ' Ml
has been courting the anti-prohibi- II
tion vote. The whole matter reveals lEfl
a double header staged by Mr. Ham- I RH
bcrgcr with the saloon element on KH
one side and the people in the rural BH
districts on the other. It is related ' MM
in Salt Lake that he courted the ami IbB
piohibitionists early in the cam- . HH
paigil and lead the saloons to be; '
licvc that he was for them. Later he' j JM
went into the country and began . ' H
telling the people what-a strong pro ' HH
hibitionist he was and how he wasA i 1HI
going to put the saloons out of tsfl
business. Some Salt I.akcrs who' 91
were on to his game, followed him' 'H
and took words verbatim in short- ''iaB
hand, afterwards transcribed them MM
and delivered his prohibition mess- CgH
.age to the anti-prohibitionists whom ' UBfl
he had previously favored. This, a.' T'l
course, enraged the saldJh'tntf"anl'K' f.jH
whatever otcs of that, character' ' !
may go 'to Morris will not be be- ' IBB
cause he has compromised himsclfJ BB
ii the least, but from th.c fact that ''Bfl
Mr. Bamberger has nun, a double t ' HJ
header, which is proving, a foarback t Hi
to his campaign. All men admire , Bj
a man that pursues one consistent sfl
course on a question of sucli" vital . HJ
Interest to the people, and in this 1 'HJ
particular they know where Nephi ti'flB
L. Morris stands. Mr. Morrris will !!
speak af Nibley Hall- on Monday ' 'HJ
night where every voter can hear ' HJ
for himself just what alliances he has- HI
made. i'HJ
In the same issue the Journal ' HH
resurrects a statement made by fl
President Joseph I. Smith, in Octob- Hj
cr, 1912, wherein he says he is -glad FH
that the executive authorities of our tjj
nation have been dictated by a high- in
er wisdom by which they have kept jj2
their hands clean from the. shedding i!
of blood aud that he is glad lis
that the executives of our own ?H
government have seen it wise to let E
the Mexicans slay themselves if they ' S
are determined to slay and destroy. . ) B
This will not foot a single voter' from I
the fact that it was uttered prior to u ! I
tlje election of Mr. Wilson before I I
he. had destroyed the only govern- 'J
ment there was in Mexico, which r
government had protected American 1
lives and property, before President i I
Wilson had favored and' courted Vil- HJ
