Washington. D C, Nov. 4. Virtual
completion of its investigation of news
,' print paper prices is announced by
tne federal trade commission. Con
tract prices rose this year from less
than 2 per hundred to 33 and $3 30.
and on current market purchases the
publishers have paid t" or more for
1 paper bought in the same way prior
to January 1 for between $2 and 32.
1 Most of the contracts now in opera-
' t'on will expire within three or four
months.
"On current market purchases." the
commission declares, "newspaper pub
lishers have been paying manufac
turers and Jobbers very much higher
prices than heretofore. Before January-
1. 191. current market prices
ranged generally between $2 and $3
per hundred tounds delivered, depend
ing on quantity, freight and other cir
cumstances: but since that time they
have ggone up as high as 3S or 37
per hundred pounds and even higher
I in exceptional instances.
1 "It is generally claimed in the trade
, that costs in the future will increase
particularly on account of the scarcity
of labor in the Canadian woods and
the consequent increase in labor coats
. of bringing logs to the mills. Re
cently most mills have been operated
24 hours per day for six days per
week.
"Exports were small compared with
