ELECTION PASSESWIfIOlDISTIBANICE
Late.Figures Show that Pleasa.nts Majority Will Reach
32,000. Part of Third District Goes Democratic Dem-.
ocrats Carry 49 Out of the 64 -Parishes.
The election went of quietly in
at. Tammany parish end no charge of
frau4 has been made. Notwithstand
ing a strong fight was made in some2
wards, not a single precinct equaled
the vote polled in the primary of
Jann ary 25. The Tenth Ward came
nearest doing so, the vote In the pr:
mary being 130 snd in the election
last Tuesday 129, a loss of one vote.
The vote of the entire parish at tht
primary was 2203, at Tuesday's elec
tion 1691. While considerable in
terest was manifested in the election
in Covington, and an effort was made
.to get out the full -trength of tthe
vote, only 352 votes were polled in
the Third Ward, compared to 431 in
the primary. This difference is prob
ably due to the urgent need of worn
on the farms, - voters in the rural.
part of the ward feeling that they
could not spare time, and also tha
as Pleasant was going to be elected
any how it would not make much
Sdifference.
There were but two wards in the
parish that gave Parker a majority
and it is a peculiar coincidence tha,
these two wards were the first anc
last wards of the parish. iWard One
gave Parker a majority of 28 and
.Ward Ten a majority of 6655. As :
further peculiar situation, the next
highest and lowest wards gave Pleas
ant the largest majority of any twc
wards, Pleasant's majority In the
Second Ward being 100 and in the
Niath 106. The biggest majority for
Pleasant in any single ward was In
the Ninth, the Siath following with
103. Pleasant's majority in the par
iah was 383, which was practlcally
the majority claimed by the leaders
of the Democratic party before the
election.
The municipal election at Abita, in
the Tenth Ward, was' probably re
sponsible for the majority for Park
er in that ward, as the town fight
was a bitter one and there Is no tell
ing what trades were made. Pearl
River and Slidell also had local elec
$Aons, but Slidell was so overwhelm
ingly for Pleasant that inroads on
the vote was practically impossible.
There were but three votes difference
in the Seventh Ward.
The vote of Pleasant was undoubt
edly strengthened by the arrival of
Congressman Morgan at ManderSlile
and the independent race of Com
stock for police juror against Smith
Smith beating him badly.
The town election at S·1dell result
ed" in the election of Los 'Baton
mayor with a vote of 86. Town
Marshal Elliott had no opposition.
The vote for mayor and 1ouncil was
as follows: For Mayor--Lon. Ba-.

Baume Gave Himself. Up to
Night Marshal Broom;
Confessed Shooting.
Thursday of last week, at 10:15 p.
m., V. A. Baume shot and killed Ber
ton Alsobrook, at Center Point, in
the Eighth Ward.
It is said the shooting was the re
sult of jealousy. Alsobrook was shot
in the back of the head, just as .he
was coming out of Baume's gate,
Coroner Bulloch stating that the
shot could be traced, by the wadding
from the gun, from the body of tht
dead man to a pig-pen behind which
Baume wap supposed to be standing.
Alsobrook must have died instantly,
as the double-barrel shot gun used
was charged with buckshot and the
range short.
Baume was placed in the parish
jail at Covington. It is reported that
Baume and .Alsobrook had had a dif
ficulty previous to the shooting, but
no evidence of this appears in the
proceedings of the inquest.
Alsobrook has not borne . good rep
utation. Baume states that he hao
been badly beaten up by Alsobrook
and that he only shot him -because it
became necessary to save his life,
and Baume's condition bears out hi'
statement, as he is bruised and band
aged. He gave himself up to Night
:Marshal Broom, of Slidell, and was
brought to Covington Saturday.
WILL ORGANIZE
MUNICIPAL
BAND
Competent Instructors Have
Been Secured; Subscrip
tions Will Be Asked.
Covington has sadly felt the need
of- a good brass band. Every time
we wish to celebrate the expense of
music is so great that we are dis
couraged in attempting anything
above the ordinary. We are over
joyed when we can command the
toot-toot of a few volunteer instru
ments, and public dances are some
times pulled off with the assistance
of a piano. Ptublic occasions, be they
dinners, dancing or speaking, are
threatened with disaster at the start
because of the music problem, and
picnics and gatherings at the park,
that might be so grealy enjoyed
with the accompaniment of good
music, fall flat for the want of it. I
A movement has been started tc
remedy this, and if the citizens re
spond as they should Covington will
soon have the band that is so much
needed. Last Sunday the plan wac
Started by a dinner at J. M. Aouell
le's, where Mrs. Aoueille delighted
everyone with bne of those appetiz
ing and enjoyable spreads that only
the good housewife and expert cook
knows how to prepare. It was en
joyed hugely, and every one present
was in a good humor to build the
foundation of the Municipal Band of
Covington.
SThere were present: Mayor P. J.
Lacroix, Postmaster Jacob Seiler,
Win. Bernard FontaS, Prof. C. c
Kornfeld, Prof. P. Giraude and E. V.
Ridhard. Prof. Girande is not well
known in Covington in capacity of a
musician, and it may be well to an
nounce that he is an expert musici
an, thoroughly competent to teach a
band, heartily in accord with the
movement and willing to give his
services in perfecting the members in
the art of producing good music
His services will be invaluable. Prof.
Korafeld is well known in Covington
as acompetent musician. With these
two to assist in the instruction, the
only thing needed to have a good
rand is to get the instruments. It
is proposed to do this by subscription

Little Band of Worshipers Has Grown,Into.r-:Iirg: .
and Prosperons Catholic Cdhgregation.
The nucleus ol St. PeterLs Church
was a handful Of devout Catholics
who gathered ;in humble meeting
places prior to 1843. In that year
the first lot was' nrchased on which
a modest church was built. In 1838
the second and third lots were pur
-hased, and the little eongregation
struggled together in the upbuild
ing of the faith, gaining steadily in
strength and numbers until 1902,
when the new ichrch and pastor's,
residence was' 'iadlt. Rev. Jos..
Koegerl becameo pastor February 26,
1890, and has be.n an indefatigable
worker and a va.ijble aid in the ad
vancement of thl Chereh, spirttually
and financially.
In the early da~y there were meet
ings at which not more than four or
five were congregated. Today the
membership probably numbers a
thousand. Then sometimes the pas
tor resided in Maddeville, as did Rev.
Krats and Rev. Avellhe, sometimes
at Mdisonville, as in the case of
Rev. Manorite, arnd most of the m had
Strawberry Growers Will Ship Th.re
Times Amount They Did Lat. Ye
President Warner of the St. Tam
many Farmers' Association has made
arrangements with .the Strawvberry
Distributing Co., of New Orleans, fto
the ,putting up of seventy-five barrels
of strawberries for fruit and syrup
mantfacture. This will be a great
help to the growers, because ber
rim may be used that would not do
for shipping and that otherwise
might not find a market. This comn
pany put up a quantity of St. Tam
many berries last year.
The shipment of berries has been
to subscribe to the fund to buy the
instruments.
It is proposed that this band shall
be a municipal band and that the in
struments shall belong to the town of
Covington. It Id also purposed that
a Junior band shall be organized and
instructed, so that in the absence of
a member from the regular band a
