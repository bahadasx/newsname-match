A FAMOUS NEGRO PREACHER
Dr. Charles T. Walker, Pastor of the Instituti
onal Church, Augusta, Ga., Called the
Best Preacher in America.
PREACHES TO JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER
Aged Negro, Former Slave, Has a Firm Friend in the
Oil King.
John D. Rockefeller finds he can
hear the gospel preached better In Au
gusta, Ga., than anywhere, else' In the
world.
And the preacher Is a Negro, horn
a slave.
The richest man In the world sits
in one of the front pews reserved for
white people, and the congregation
sings old hymns as only Negroes can
sing them.
The voices of the women rise in a
fine treble, and the bass of the men.
REV. T. H. EWING, D.D.
One of the most Influential ministers
in this city who Is rounding out his
twentieth year as pastor of the Vine
Street Baptist Church, and who has
the unusual honor of pastorlng a
congregation of 1,000 members, more
than 60 per cent of whom are prop
erty owners, due to his wise coun
sel and advice, and who has mate
rially assisted Captain Todd and
Lieutenant Lacey of No. 11 fire com
pany in cleaning up conditions on
Vine street between Eighteenth and
Nineteenth. All Kansas City hon
ors him.
educational and religious work the
preacher was supporting. v
Finally Charles Walker began the
effort to build an Institutional church
for Negroes In Augusta which shall
teach not only religion, but work. This
church will be completed In the fall
of this year, will cost about $100,000
and will seat a congregation of 3,000
people.
Mr. Rockefeller, ex-President Taft
and' a great many others have con
tributed to the fund with which the
church Is being built.
It was Walker's plan to teach sew
ing at the church, to have a broom fac
tory and a carpenter's shop there, and
In every other possible way to make
It a help to his people. '
He has an advisory board of white
citizens of Augusta, who aid him with
the affairs of the church, and who be
lieve he is the wisest leader the Ne
gro race has today.
Mr. Rockefeller Is Intensely Inter
ested In the church and often writes
the pastor about its affairs. The rich
est man in the world has several times
said of the Georgia Negro who Is an
ex-slave:
"Ho seems to me to have more of
the spirit of religion than any man
I've ever heard preach." 'Philadelphia

A RECORD BREAKING MEETING.
The community meeting held at the

one of the most enjoyable and large
ly attended numbers on the season's

ment of the colored club women of
the city. Mrs. Crosthwalt introduced

repeating the chorus, breaks In with
a deep rumble of sound. They sway
their bodies slightly, and their voices
rise in a chant of praise.
"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," is fol
lowed by "I Shall He Whiter Than
Snow," and then by hymns of their
own, which you can hear nowhere but
in a Negro church:
"Good Lawd, I wonder,
"Good Lawd, I wonder,
"Good Lawd, I wonder.
"Is anybody here gettln' ready to die?"
"Amen!" says an old man, whose
wolly hair Is turning gray and who
hobbles with a cane.
"Praise God!" exclaims a woman's
high voice, and her face lights up with
the glory of religion.
The organ drops from the rich, wor
shipful music to an epilogue of the
organist's Invention, and the congre
gation sits back to hear the gospel
preached with a fire that reaches the
sinner's heart.
And Mr. Rockefeller sits with them.
The preachor, Charles Walker, who
has been half-hidden behind the tall
stand on which Is the big Bible, gets
up and looks around at his congrega
tion. He Is a very black, plain look
ing Negro, Just like any other Georgia
Negro; and he speaks .with the rich'
ness and the feeling tliat Is Inherit in
his race.
John D. Rockefeller's example has
set a fashion among the rich tourists
wintering ,in Augusta. At times the
Negro preacher, an ex-slave, has a
dozen millionaires among his hearers.
But he doesn't seem to know they are
there. He preaches Just the same
delivers the same message of the good
ness of God,
Now tliat Booker T. Washington la
dead, Walker Is the most remarkable
Negro in the South. He was born In
1858 as tho property of Dr. W. A.
Clark, who lived In Augusta. The war
came on and tho emancipation of
slaves followed. He was Just a picka
ninny then, and he doesn't remember
anything about those times. But ho
recalls vividly his struggles for an
education; and how, at last, he found
a place at the Atlanta Baptist college.
To was trained thero for a preacher,
an began even as a young man to be
known for his eloquence.
Twice he went to Europe, both times
to attend tho World's Baptist Alliance,
and In London met Dr. Spurgeon, who
called htm the "preacher from the
soil."
In New York he came to knpw John

READ HIS DECISION.
.
St. Louis, April 17. The enforce
ment of the Negro segregation ordi
naco of St. Louis wa3 enjoined by the
federal district court here today.
The injunction was granted by Dis
trict Judge Dyer, who said he made
the order teriiporary only because the
federal supreme court now is consider
ing a segregation cas from Louisville,
Ky. Otherwise, he eald, he would have
granted a permanent injunction.
One segregation ordinance prohibits
whites or blacks frotu living in a block
In which 75 per cent of the houses are
occupied ""by persons of the opposite
race. The ordinance makes similar re
strictions, but tho proceedings Is 100
Instead of 75.
In announcing his decision Judge
Dyer said:
"There is practically but one ques
tion before the court the fact of the
validity of these ordinances.
"I have lived in this state within
sixty miles of this spot sevent yyears.
My father was a ,T-Jve owner. Never
theless, I have a'llfaya- tried to be Just
to all Negroes.
"Tho Judgment of the court i that
these ordinances nro void and illegal,
A man has a right to occupy property
that he owns, under the laws of the
United States and the constitution.
"The Negro Is entitled to the same
consideration and the same rights as
Is a white man."

WHAT NEW FASHION IS COMING NEXT?
We are afflicted every season with
a fad or two. This season, we are to
have more of the indecent than of the
decent kind. We are to have the kind
of shows that men of a class, used to
go to low-class vaudeville to see. The
fancy shoes (price, style and color)
are to be worn with dresses, any
where between shoe top and knee.
Styles of this kind appeal to "sporty"
old women who need only the slight
est pretext for exposing their person
and to fast young women and misses
who have In their mind that men are
attracted by exhibitions of this kind.
Of course, men of a certain type are
attracted, just as women of a certain
type will expose themselves by over
doing the short dress act. Decent
sensible, men will not be attracted;
nor will decent, sensible women lift
their dresses to such a height as to
expose their legs while sitting or
walking.
We write, however, to urge the
mother whose daughter has passed her

sixteenth year, not to allow her to
wear her dresses at such a length as
to expose herself to the gaze of in
decent men. We write also to beg
poor mothers who try to dress their
daughters in the height of fashion, not
to waste their money buying fancy
shoes. Black shoes for Winter,
Spring, and Fall, and white shoes for
Summer, are as smart and as near the
correct thing for fashionable people
who want to keep within the pale of
decency, as anything In the shop.
A great many girls art not only go
ing to lose their modesty, but they
are going to lose their virtue as a re
sult of a style that Is nothing less
than an invitation to a large class of
men who roam about and sit around,
seeking whom they may devour. It
isn't necessary to wear trains, but it
Is far from decent for a woman or a.
girl to expose herself as this extreme
Indecent, freakish Spring style sug
gests. The sensible mother will lay
down this law: If her daughter has
been wearing long dresses, she will
not let her wear them above her shoo
tops now. These old women who are
wearing their dresses at any length,
from shoe top to half way to the calf
of the leg should be arrested and,
charged Five Dollars for each offense.
A few summers ago, we were sleeve
less. The next season we turned our
necks and chest out. Last season we
wore transparent dresses. This sea
Bon, we have knee dresses. In the
name of decency, what next?
We have reached the place for pro
test and feel as much justified as the
woman who attended a moral reform
meeting a few years ago. "The
speaker went on to say It is time that
we had a moral awakening In this
town. Let us arise in our might. Let
us gird up our loins. Let us take off
our coats. Let us bear our arms. Let
us "
"Hold on, now," screamed the an
gular lady, who was seated near the
platform, "if this Is to be a moral
awakening, don't you dare to propose
to take oft another thing."

brave as this woman? N. H. Bur
