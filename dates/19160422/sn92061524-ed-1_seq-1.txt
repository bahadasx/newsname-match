these days and we are better equipped

Stray Thoughts
' Seems to us we had rather change
the name of our political party and be
associated with a party that is control
ed by the best men in it an4 with
lofty ideals for the betterment of the
state than stick to the old party name
and be associated with men whom we
can think of only with disgust and
look upon as criminals.
It looks to a man on the side-lines,
as if the G. 0. P. Old Guard were
turning in "States Evidence" against
each other in their fight for nomina
tions. It can't do any harm. We already
know enough about their past history
to eternally damn. them and repetitions
are tiresome. We haven't forgotten
anything and don't intend to.
"Teddy" is a nasty, bitter little pill
for the G. 0. P., but it looks now like
they will have to swallow him or they
might as well save up their campaign
money.
We admit to being a little "Gun-shy'
and that is why we don't take to the
"Terrible Ted" and prefer Wilson who
settles disputes more like a good citi
zen, but if it must be a Republican, let
it be Teddy. ,
Ralph C. Ely is spoken of by an ex
change as "The Little Rebel" We
wouldn't resent that if we were in his
place. It is an earnest character that
makes him rebel at the things his par
ty leaders do. The signers o,the dec
laration of Independence were Rebels
and it is a true American senthnéñt
that rebels at the ravishment of every
principle enunciated in that document.
Selfishness and bigotry have ' made
some men forget the underlying prin
ciples upon which 'our government is
builded and it is the highest type of
citizen who rebels against it.
ELY-ISMS
"I have not the slightest bit of sym
pathy with a dirty political machine
whether it is found in' New Mexico or
elsewhere and I know no difference in
parties in this regard."
"I have been unable to see any sub
stantial improvement thru the third
party,, or Progressive movement.' .
"There, will be a 'Judas Iscariot' in
every band of twelve.'
"I genuinely believe that the vast
majority of the rank and file of both
the great political parties believe in
common honesty, fair dealing and all
the other qualities which go to make
up personal uprightness in . politics
just as much as they do in business.
"The Constitution of New Mexico
has so Gerrymandered the state that
there is no hope of electing a Demo
cratic Senate and little probability of
electing a Democratic House."
"I know the old time Democratic
Leaders of this state as well as 1
know the old time Republicán leaders.
Morally and patriotically, one gang is
as bad as the other."-
Paul Nutter, wife and son, arrived

Miss Shirley Nutter came home from
