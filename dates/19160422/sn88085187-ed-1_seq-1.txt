JUST WHERE
11. S. STANDS
By Walter L. Davis
Professor of Hiktciry »t the <>>Ue« eof Phuci Sound. Written Ks|ie
fUlly for T he Times.
£tt lii taking his firm stand in behalf of Amer
>|| ioan rights on the high seas, President Wil
son has the accepted ratal of international Jaw
and practice upon his side.
fK There were three courses open to the ad-
ministration at Washington:
1. To insist on the accepted rules of interna
tonal law.
2. To revise those rules and adapt them to
submarine warfare.
3. To warn Americana to remain off ships of
nations engaged in war.
fIT President Wilson has chosen the first course
yH indicated above. Having taken that posi
tion, he could hardly do otherwise than come to
tile brink of war, to suspend diplomatic negotia
tions even if actual war should not follow.
dt A majority of the American people probab
™ ly approve of the president's position, al
though many would have preferred another
'. course.
j ftt We are a powerful people and have a strong
™| antipathy to au aggressive war; and as a
people we shall hope that there will come no
vlattli of arms. But should that untoward event
take place, PRESIDENT WILSON TAN
