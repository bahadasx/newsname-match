realizing his condition and
knowing that the end was rapid
ly approaching, he expressed
the hope that he might live to see
Col. Pleasant elected governor.
But he died just as the polls
opened for the day's voting.
Mr. Fuqua Ywas well known,
throughout the state. Hle was a
manager of Governor Jared Y.
Sanders' campaign for governor
in 1907-8 and was his private
secretary until near the close of
his administration, when he re
signed that post to become man
ager of the Sanders senatorial
campaign. He was a member of
the DemoCratic State Central
Committee at large from the ,
Sixth congressional district for
twelve years and was chairman
of the senatorial committee ofi
that district.
His wide acquaintance with
men and his knowledge of state
conditions especially equipped t
him for campaign work, and.
:when Col. Pleasant opened his
D ary campaign, with head-.
4u rs at the Cosmopolitan.
Mr. Faqua became assoiciated
witih the management and ren
dered valuable aid. Following
that successful canvass, he was ,
chose a member of the Demo
eratic State campaign committee 1i
and was placed in charge of itin
eraries and speakers: e
As page in Legislature Started in
Politics.
He carried on this work until
health completely failed, and

~ttention that medical skill could

that the expert attention of the

Another Case Of Law
Viojation.
We had the pleasure of the visit
C of our zealous Deputy Sheriff,
Charles I.asseigne, of Reserve,
last Wednesday.
Mr. Lasseigne served as Deputy
aL the polling booth of the 5th
ward last Tuesday and informs
us thathe used every effort at his
command to have the votes cast
at that booth according to law.
Notwithstandinrz the solemn
protests of our friend Charley,
txvo commissioners or election at
that booth, Mr. Wallace Las
seigne, editor of the reform news- 1
paper, , L'Observateur, a Parker
booster, and Mr. Amede1e Duh.
Jr., insisted in helping the Par
ker voters to their ballot and
deliberately walked in the polling
booth in order to do so - -acts t
which areglaring violations of'the
,aw
This was further in violation of r
Tobn M. Parker's apparent de
termination to insure the secresy
of the ballot to every voter at the
,;eneral election.
It certainly is an unusual coinci
iience, which no doubt will sur- 1i
*)rise SOME people, that the Par
'er folks should have chosen the
"virtuous" editor of L'Observa
teuras an actor in this piece of
political carruption. W allace Las
seigne is always preaching "re- n
form" and "clean and fair elec
tion" in his infamous journal,
but when he was chosen to see
:hat the election would be carried
in in a clean and fair manner,
ie deliberately and willingly aid- B
ed in the perpatration of fraud in
)raer to serve his own selfish I
interest I
Reliable information has reach a
ed our ears that some seventy or n
eighty voters were thus illegally ii
assisted in fixing their ballot in ti
the 5th ward contrary to the well t
known provisions of the law. b
Those violations could not have o
effected the results of Col. Pleas n
ant's election, but we submit that C
it is high time for such political `
violations of the lav to cease in S
this parish.
We would like to impress upon a
thos min authority to see to it that
such violators of the election law
be orought before the Tribunal C
of Justice and be dealt with there C
accordingly. u

THE RESULT.
Colonel Pleasant Sweeps The Stal
Like A Cyclone.
Democratic majority May R..ach 35,Ool
The overwhelming majorit
received by Col Ruffin G. Plea:
the Democratic nominee was no
a surprise to us as we had lone
ago predicted the result. Ihe fac
that St. John parish gave Johi
M. Parker a majority in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth wards
jid not surprise anyone as it wa,
i known fact that the Hart Fac.
.ion were contintoisly working
end boosting for John M. Par
ter, the Progrsssive-Republicar
-andidate.
However we are proud to sec
hat the First, Second and Third
yards gave Colonel Pleasant a
trong majority, showing that
here is still a strong Democratic
eeling in St. John parish.
UTpto press time we had nct
eceived the corre-'t official tabu
ition of the St. John votes and
herefore regret being unable to
urnish our readers the correct
oting in each ward. All we can
ay is that St. John gave a ma
,rity to the Progressive- Repub
,can candidate in St. John,
'.he Berthelot Faction, vho
tood by Col. Pleasant from the
tart certainly deserve praise and
redit for the bold front they
lade throughout the parish. It
lust be remembered that the
erthelot people were fighting
at only the Hart Faction but
so against the big planters of
is parish.
Notwithstanding all that the
erthelot Faction had to contend
ith it was a surprise to many
'hen the boxes were opened
uesday evening. Many who
sere going so far as to expect a
iajority in the First ward were
a precarious condition wnen
ie votes were counted. When
he second and third wards were
card from fainting spells were
f common occurance Tuesday
ight for the neat majority given
ýolunel Pleasant in these three
ards showed conclusively that
herifft erthelot and his proud
'action are not yet dead as they
ad swept these three wards like
terrific cyclone.
Withmore complete returns,
% itn more complite returns,
Col. tleasant's majority is still
climbing and the latest figures
up to 1 o'clock Friday indicated
that he would carry tne state by
nearly 35,000 majority over John
M. Parker, nis Republican-Pro
gressive adversary,
The total vote of the State at
that time was 125,986, a new re-'
cord for the number of votes
polled.
Pleas'ant's total vote had reach-,
I ed 78,600 and Parker's total 47,
377.
Both Fernand Mouton and Ed
S. Bronssard, Democratic and
Progressive candidates for Lieu
tenant governor, ran behind the
heads of the ticket. r.eturns up!
to Thursday noon indicated that
Mouton has been elected over
Broussard from 23,000 to 25,000.
The entire Democratic State
ticket was elected.
Pleasant has carried both the
districts. He will have a majority
of some 1000 in the Sixth, while
in the Seventh, with Cameron
E still out, Pleasant majority is 406
The missing parish will add con
siderably to his lead Of the eight
parishes comprising the Seventh
.rder carried four of them: St
tiandry by 632; Jefferson DavisJ
by 49; Acadia by 412 and Evan
geline by 180,
Pleasant Carries 49
'Out of 64 Parishes.
Parker carried fifteen parishes
out of 64 in the State, Col. Pleas
ant, in his pre-election fo' ecast,
declared that he would carry fif

tnh 49.
Mr. Parker obtained seven U.n
of the eight in the 'hird tiStric:,
viz: Assumption, Lafourcie,
e Terrebonne, St. LMary, I,' :"i i,
Vermilion an] Lafayette. H1
i carried two i, the Second distri:t
St. James and St. John. tie woei
Stwo in the Sixth disnrict, P'oinre
(Coupee and West Batin Roug,..
• and he carried four in the Sevei~th
g-iving him the fifteen tutal.
! D.emocratici ,oads in the Tilb r
Sdstrict reduced t'arker's exp~-ct
ed majority in the sugar parilshcs
to 4022, and caused hirm to lose
St. Martin, which went for Pleas
ant by 21.
We congratulate Governor-elect
Plaasant, and the entire Demo
cratic ticket on their great vic
tory in Louisiana.
