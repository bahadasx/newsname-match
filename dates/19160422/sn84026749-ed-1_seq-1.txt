PURSUIT SEEN
TO AVERT WAR
All Indications Point to Early
Withdrawal of American
Forces From Mexico.
CONFERENCE NEXT MONDAY
Chairman Stono Expected to Go
Over Situation With Presi
dent Wilson Then.
AH indications in official circles
point to an early withdrawal cf
tho American forces from M'ex'co.
Face to face with tho alterna
tive of a break with Carranza or
, an abandonment of the pursuit of
Villa, tho President and his ad
visors are believed to have made
up their minds that a continuation
of the chase would be almost cer
tain to lead to intervention, whi'-h,
from tho first, the President ns
been determined to avoid.
On Monday at, 8 o'clock the
Pres;dcnt is to have a conference
with Chairman William J. Stone,
of thSenatc Foreign Relations
Committee.
Although it is stated at the
.White House that the conference
will be in connection Nvith the
general international situation, tho
impression prevails that it will
deal principally with the Mexican
situation.
REPORT DUE.
Before that 'time it. la expected the
War Department will have received
from k Major General Scott, who was
sent to San Antonio to confer with
Major General Funaton, a complete sur
vey of the military situation In Mexico
with whatever prospect exists for the
capture of Villa.
The Administration Is particularly
anxious to get an exact Idea of the at
titude of the Carranzlsta forces, and
the extent to which these forces are
organizing to block a further advance
ct the expedition.
Jjrom reports already receive! from
Kunstons headquarters army officers
at the War Department aro convlncod
that If tho expedition Is to be carried
fcrward it will have to be reorganized
on the bals o -neeting with Carrcn
zljta opposition.
Such a reorganization. It Is stated.
would not only probably necessitate
plans to seize the Mexican railroads.
tut would, require the calling out of
the National Guard to guard the bor
der, thus freeing the entire regular
army forco for posslb'o scrvlco acrosd

Official Concerned.
State Department officials ore frank

More because of thd lack of consular

Plan To "Speed Up"
District Bills Blocked
In House Committee
Congressman Vinson Refuses
Unanimous Consent to Re
port Uncontested Measures.
forces an Adjournment
Georgia Member Insists on Con
siderationScheme Was to
Put Thirty on Calendar.
The Plan of Chairman Ben Johnson, of
the House Dlitrlct Committee, to report
to the House thirty supposedly uncon
tested bills now pending before that
committee, was frustrated today by
Congressman Carl Vinson of Georgia,
When the District Committee con
vened to frame. Its "unanimous consent"
calendar, Mr. Vinson moved an Immedi
ate adjournment, and the motion was
carried on a viva voce vote.
Subsequently, It was explained by Mr.
Vinson that this action did not mean
ho wat opposed to the "unanimous con
sent" calendar (or tho District Com
mlttee.i but he objected to any hurried
consideration of many bills on Mr. John
son's program. .
Some of these measures, he said, have
not been acted upon by subcommittees,
and the Georgia member wants Uie
regular courso followed.
Among tho measures upon which ac
tion was delayed temporarily in com
mittee today were the "fako auction,"
the "bad check." and the "true con
slderrtion" bills the latter applying to
the recital of true consideration In deeds
covering real estate transfers In the
District.
Chairman Johnson had also placed
upon the unanimous consent calendar
tho "community forum" bill In which
Miss Margaret Wilson, daughter of tho
President, Is so much Interested.
An effort will bo made to report out
some of these bills at tho regular meet
ing of the House District Committee
early next week.
Vlnsono Stand Bans Speed.
The objection of Mr. Vinson, however,
practically precludes the creation of a
"unanimous consent" calendar for the
House committee. The meeting called
today was a special one.' The object was
to place upon such a calendar and bring
Into the House aU uncontested bills be
fore the District Committee.
The committee han been more or less
Inactive 'for the past month, this being
partly due to the lack of a quorum ami
partly to tho action of the pomocratlo
caucus which decreed that all so-called
minor legislation should be sidetracked
In tho llouso.
Chairman Johnson hit upon the plan
of putting about thirty bills upon the
House calendar by meeting today. Mr.
Vinson 'a objection, according to Mr.
Johnson, frustrates tho plan for expedit
ing legislation.
'I have no objection whatever to
most of tho bills proposed for this spe
cial calendar," said Mr. Vinson. "I ex
pect that practically all of them will be
reported out, but I objected to report
ing thirty bills at one meeting of the
committee, and moved to adjourn. This
was not done for the purpose of defeat
ing any special bill or bills, but. I think
-there should bo more consideration
given some of these measures."
Both Congressmen Vinson and Rags
dale are listed among the opponents of
the "community forum- bills, but It Is
not known whether this opposition In
fluenced Mr. Vinson In any way today.
He called attention to the Important
character of many of the measures
suggested for Immediate report.
Johnson's Program.
Chairman Johnson's legislative pro
gramto which ho hoped there would
not be objection In the committee In
cluded tho following bills:
Permitting an increase of spool of au
tomobile Ir. the District; providing for
thn annual assessment of 'real estate;
directing tho closing of all barber rhop
on Sunday; lmpoblng a special license
tax on automobiles; prohibiting the im
proper uso of the United States flag; al
lowing thn use df school houses as
"community forums"; changing tho
status of street crossing pollccn.on; pro
hibiting fuke auctions In tho District;
designating October 11 mr a. leral holi
day, to bo known as Columbus Day:
Incorporating tho Bast Washington ,and
Suburban Railway, arlous street bills.
Chairman Johnson is jnderstood to
have called attention to the fact that
some of tho subcommittees to which
these bills have Leen referred. Including
tho sjbcommltteo hcHded by Mr. Vin
son, have not spedily reported on thorn.
I to suggested that as the bills are of de
sirable character the full committee
might dispose of thm by unanimous
consent, putting on the House calendar
In the hopo that the committee will soon
bo given a day in the House for tbolr
passage.

No Trace of Body Found, But
Developments Warrant Con

NEW YORK. April 25.-About an old.
rambling colonial house, secluded on the
banks of tho Hudson, near West Folnt,
centered a search today for tho body
of Dorothy Arnold, missing New York
heiress, whoso disappearance five years
ago furnished a mystery baffling the
police of Europe and America.
In a cold drixzte of rain scores of
curious tourists made their way aver
thn roads from West Folnt to gaze upon
the tTfeak old house.
Convict Glennoris, In the Rhode Island
penitentiary, says It holds the secret
of tho young woman's disappearance.
Inspector Faurot, In New York, Is
gathering every Item of Information re
garding tho possible house of death. He
admitted tody that a portion of the
cellar had been dug up when he and
four of his detectives visited the place
last night. They failed to find a body,
but the search has not been abandoned.
On the contrary the Information
gained so far leads taurot and his men
to believe that Glennorrls must have
had a part In some crime In the section
ho has been able to describe so minutely.
Whether or not ne actually was a
party to the burial of Dorothy Arnold,
Faurot Is not ready to concede, but he

Lokal Anzleger Says Sastifac
tory Settlement Is Possible,
Despite Great Alarm.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
KKRMN, April " 22. American offi
cials here were confronted today with
the problem of what to do, with Amerl
cans arriving In Berlin fro mlnterlor
cities of Germany because of reports
that Germany and the Unltod Htates are
on the verge of a break.
United States Consul General Lay con
ferred with Ambasador Gerard on this
subject this morning. Gerard said he
had received no Instructions from Wash
ington regarding the 700 Americans now
In Germany.
The Berlin Lokal Anzelger, Influential
liberal newspaper, which claims tho
largest circulation In Gcrmanq, today
expressed the view that a satisfactory
settlement of the pending controversy is
possible, desplto pessimistic reports.
The Lokal Anzelger hns not thus far
examined tfio text of President Wilson's
latest note.
"We insist on tho right to hit our foes
In the weakest spot." said tho Lokal
Anzelfler. "Nevertheless, we want peace
with tho great pcoplo ncros the water.
Just as wo have not wanted war with
our present foes.
"An agreement with the United States
should be possible, even acrosi the
ocean. We reemphasize that It la pos
sible we have overstepped our right to
safeguard our vital Interests and honor.
However, we reservo the right to state
or viewpoint when wo have knowledge
of the note."
The Berlin newspapers tpday pub
lished an English news ngenry dispatch
Indicating for tho nrst time that tho
German-American situation is very seri
ous. The public generally belovcs the
English report to be an exaggeration.
ine text of the American note tnus

Americans Get Ready
To Flee From Germany
THE HAGUE, Aprlt 22,-Many Ameri
can business men In Germany have
made preparations to wind up their
affairs and leave on 4S hours' notice If
diplomatic relations between Germany
and the United States are broken off.
This was learned today from Holland
branches of several American concerns
doing business In Germany. In a num
ber of cases Berlin representatives of
American firms havo made arrange
menta to come to Holland, leaving
their affairs In the hands' of other neu
trals In Berlin and directing their ofn
ces from Amsterdam or The Hague. A
number of Americans, however, will re
main in Germany even though a break
occurs, confident that It will not result
In war.
Thus far there has been no noticeable
lncreaao In the number of American
crossing the Dutch frontier from Ger
many slnco the situation became criti
cal. Several Americans now In Holland
who planned to leave for Berlin earlier
In the week, have postponed their trips
and will remain here, pending the out
come of the present negotiations.
Thore are now about 700 Americans
In Germany. Since the Lusltanla crisis
last May all have been In close touch
with their consulates, at the suggestion
of Consul General Lay, at Berlin. Thoso
wishing to leave Germany probably
would concentrate In Berlin and travel
by special train to the Dutch frontier.
Excitement over the Gcrman-Amerl.
can situation has subsided, noticeably
since inn ursi uuicu newspaper com
ment on the American note. The feel
ing Is growing here that Germany
either will yield nt once or will maneu
ver matters In such a manner as to
prevent an earlv break.
Little Hope Here That
Germany Will Yield
Little hope that Germany will meet
fully the American submarine demands
Is apparent here today.
Statements of Admiral von Hbltzen
dorff, German admiralty staff chief,
furnished the State Department tho
nrst definite line on the German offi
cial attitude.
The conclusion was drawn by some
officials that perhaps modification of
the sternness or the American demands
ofterod the only chance of avoiding a
diplomatic break. Such a modification
Is out. of the question, they said.
The United States has held two posi
tions on submarine warfare. At first,
this Government, contended it could not
"bo conducted In accord with Intorna
tlorrul law. Later It held this might
be possible,
Now. It Is Indicated officially. It will
leave to Germany the question of wheth
er she can conduct warfare without vio
lating International law, and still make
It effective.
