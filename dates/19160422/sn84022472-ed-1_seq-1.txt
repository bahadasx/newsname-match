DETECTIVES SAY
DOROTHY ARNOLD
"CLUE" IS HOAX
Find Only Water , Main in
y's Cellar of Home" In
7 West Point.
New - "ork, April 23.---The body of
Dorothy Arnold was not' found in the
cellar of the house outside West Point
where . New " York detectives searched
yesterday. : Police Inspector Faurot,
who is in charge- of the investigation,
announced today that there was no
truth in published stories that Miss
Arnold's body had been discovered.
, Inspector Faurot expressed , his opin
ion that there was nothing to the story
told? by Octave Charles G-lennorris, a
con, viet In a Rhode Island prison, that
he aided in the burial in a West Point
cellar, -of a young woman resembling
Miss Arnold in description. , -
Those who had conducted the search
had been quoted as saying that a body
was found, under the cement flooring
an isolated house two miles" south
of West Point, but' Inspector Faurot
said that "all we found, in the cellar
was ah old four-inch water main-"
"The story told by G-lennorris is ab
solutely false," Insepctor Faurot said.
"That- is what I am going- to put in
my report to the police commission."
The - inspector v said he thought the
G-lennorris story was. told ein the hope
of obtaining parole.
A despatch received here today from
West Point said that no body had
been found and that Inspector Faurot
upon his departure last night for New
York after his , investigation had not
left detectives , on guard at the house
where 'the search, was made, as had
been reported here. ' "
Dororthy Arnold, daughter of Francis
ft. Arnold., a wealthy importer of this
city, vanished mysteriously , In 1910
while on a shopping trip on Fifth ave
nue. The present search is one of
many fruitless quests which have been
made as a result of "clues" constantly
received by the police and the Arnold
family.

NEARLY 1,000 CAST
BALLOTS IN CONTEST
Shalvoy Writes Congress
men of Man Who Got
More Votes.
(Special to The Farmer)
Danbury, April 22 The post .of
fice primary has concluded with
letter from Hugh C. Shalvoy to Cor
mer Congressman Donovan and Na
tional Committeeman Homer S. Cum
mings, which makes, the way to fill
ing the post-office very simple and
to those gentlemen, who have jthe
uuiy ui an vising me post oince ' de
partment'
There were originally four candi
dates for the post office, but, only
two of them were willing to abide the
test of the primary. There were D.
Franks Stevens, water commissioner.
and Hugh C. Shalvoy, for many years
identified 'with the United Hatters pf
ivunn America. t
The psimary was held April 8, in a
driving snow. However1, 915 voters
turned out and the ballot, was the
second largest . primary ballot ever
cast in Daniury.
Th-i result was favorable to Mr.
Stevens, and was communicated to
Mr. Cummings and Mr. Donovan.
They have also received "a letter
from Mr.. Shalvoy," bearing', date of
April 18, as follows: ,
- Honorable Jeremiah Donovan,
South Norwalk,' Conn.
.Dear Sir:
I, desire to( inform you that
there was held n , Danbury,' April
8th, a primary to , ascertain the
f will of the people of Danbury,
with respect t the choice of a
postmaster. T. '
. The election ,was conducted
with good feeling, fairness and
courtesy. Thevote was one of,
the latrgest ever. 'cast in a pri
mary in this city. -.' ;
The ' total number t of . ballets
. was 915jof which I -had 429 and
Mr. D. Frank Stevens, my oppon
- ent-had 475 and 11 ' defective.
The result is decisive, and, for
' this reason, and according to the
dictates of fair play and sound
'democracy. I withdraw my eandi-'
dacy, and venture to hope that ;
Mr. . Stevens may receive the ap
pointment according to the will
of the people. ''"''
The primary has been for
some years the method' uied by
the democrats of Danbury fo de- -teririine
choice of candidates for
important office. It has given,
general' satisfaction, and. ha J
. "Iielped the city and; the party.
While : the result Mn this case -'
was not. what I had expected, yet ;
. I am loyal to the principles of ';
popular government and hope"
, that the decision' of the people
.will be binding upon you as 'ad
viser - to the postal : department-
of the United States. -.
.Very respectfully yours, i
, HUGH C. SHALVOY. .
When the text, of Mrv Shalvoy's let
ter became public" here, it was greet
ed with expressions of approval as a
higlr- class example of how a political
contest can be conducted- between
high- grade opponents.
Mr. Shalvoy's acquiesence in the re
sult of the primary removes the last
traces of disharmony and ill-reeling,
whicS so often follow upon political
contests, and it -clears the way for
the appointment of Mr. Stevens with
the unanimous approval of the peo
pie of Danbury. ' , -
Either man. It is felt here, would
have made an acceptable candidate.
Both have had administrative ex
perience and are used to large af
fairs. Mr..' Stevens ' has improved and
regenerated the municipal water
works, reducing 'the price or water
to the consumers. -
Mr. Shalvoy has been , for many
years secretary of . tHe United Hatters
of North America, whose affairs are
aa large and complex as those of a
small government. , . '
Danbury Democrats installed the di-
been six elections since, and the dem
ocracy was victorious in every elec
tion, thanks to the good feeling and
popular satisfaction engendered by
this method of choosing. . .
