Georges Clemenceau Express
es Unqualified Admiration
for President's Message
to Berlin.
Pans, April 22 Unqualified admira
tion of President Wilson's message to
Berlin on the submarine issue is ex
pressed by George Clemenceau in his
newspaper, L'Hommc Libre. In an px
tonded analysis of the message, M.
Clemenceau says
"What strikes one ahove all in this
piece of world diplomacy which the
chief of the American republic has
submitted to the national representa
tives is its fine, impassive objectiv
ity, neither complaints nor recrimina
tions. Facts, no signs of literature,
contrary to what wo have seen in the
case of other countries, nothing, too,
oi the learned lawyer, by happj sur
prise. Simple strong words of a
statesman.
"The right, the august imprescript
ible right, which the Pilgrim Fathers
of the .Mayflower brought from Eu
rope, their sons are bringing back to
us under a shield of iron forged by
their own strong hands.
"Hail to you, American citizens, who
march back into tho history of Europe
under a great nrch on the front of
which 'Washington, Jefferson, and so
many others have carved the noblest
claims of humanity.

EXCITEMENT ON

War Shares and Stocks of
Companies Operating in
Mexico Drop Four to
Eight Points.
New York, April 22. Today's two
hour session of the stock market was
attended by much excitement and
further 'feo sell Id g. War shares and
the slocks of companies operating In
Mexico broke four to eight points and
the entire list, including investments,
was unfavorably affected.
News over the Good Friday holiday
was anything but reassuring from the
Wall street point of view. Latest de
velopments In tho German crisis were
viewed with increased concern and
reports of the proposed cancellation of
American concessions In Mexico were
responsible for the acute weakness In
that quarter of tho list. Mexico Pe
troleum fell over 8 points, with 3 to 4
point declines in American Smelting
and Greeno Cananea,
U. S. Steel fell away to tho lowest
price In weeks. At today's low aver
age special stocks comprising tho
munitions group, motors, equipments
and secondary industrials wero at min
imum prices of the year, while some
of the same shares wero from thirty to
forty points under last year's maxi
mum quotations.
Dealings wero vory heavy and broad
and In large part represented selling
by discouraged speculative interests.
There also was considerable liquida

Columbus, N. M.i April 22. A large

thin Amorican line of communication
In Mexico. The destination of the
troops was not announced and military
headquarters would make no state
ment regarding tho movement.
Sau Antonio. April 22. Secretary
Baker should be in recoipt of a report
before night from Major General Hugh

the administration In deciding wheth
er tho American troops or send them
farther into Mexico. Generals Scott
and Funston today will review in de
tail tho history of the punitive expedi
tion's operations since entering Mexi
co almost six weeks ago.
General Funston has received re
ports showing movements of Carran
za troops in the district penetrated
by General Pershing and orders have
been sent to General Pershing that au5
ihorizo him to prepare for any aggres
sion on the part of Mexicans. Car
ranza officials have given plausible
reasons for moving the forces of Gen.
Arnulfo Gomez eastward from Sonora,
the troops of General Luis Herrera
south from Chihuahua to Parral and a
considerable force towards Casas
Grandes, but should the war office at
Mexico City decide later to use these
same forces to prevent further Ameri
can military operations, General Per
shing will bo prepared for any emer
gency. Funston and Scott Confer.
Until lato last night, General Fun
ston and General Scott discussed the
developments of the pursuit of Villa
that began with promised co-operation
by Carranza troops and ended, or
practically ended, with a warning to"
Col W. C Brown at Santa Cruz by a
Carranza officials that he must noli
advance south of that point.
The chief of staff was told of the"
difficulties "elicTmTere'd'in transport
ing supplies to tho stations along the J
line of communications and of the
failure to obtain proper service over
the railroads.
I General Pershing's leports, which
are said to contain recommendations
that radical changes be authorized,
probably will be gone over carefullv
today. None of the reports received
from the front over night indicated
renewed offensive activity.

Andres Garcia, Mexican consul, as
serted that the American army would
bo able to withdraw from Mexico
