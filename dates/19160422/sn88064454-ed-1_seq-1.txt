Easter Greetings.
Easter is a day of gladness
Upward springing luto life.
If it brings a note of sadnese
'Tie the mem'ry of past strife.
Lo. I send you Easter greetings,
May't good cheer to you impart
And some responsive feeling meeting.
Awake an Easter in your heart!
Good Rain.
Sunday morning a good heavy
rain fell. which was as much as the
planters needed, and was of great
benefit to all crops. During the
next few days the effect of the
rain will be noticeable everywhere.
The cane, corn and rice crops all
needed rain, and it will prove of
special benefit to the rice that was
not up and permit the rice plan
ters to finish planting their crop
which was delayed on accounts of
the dry season.
How To Make Fly Paper
The use of sticky fly paper is
better than the use of poison to
trap flies Once a fly alights on
sticky paper he is pretty certain
to stay there until he dies. If you
place a saucer containing poison
fly paper and water in the dining
room window, the flies drink the
deadly stuff but they do not die
immediately. They may not die
until they reach the cream pitcher.
If you want to make your own
sticky fly paper, kIil together
equal parts of castor oil and resin
and spread the substance on tough
paper before it cools.

over-exertion a u d straining during

In the last issue of the Banner
Mr. Louis G. Greig comes out un
der his signature and assumes au
thorship of the article in the Ban
ner, signed "Tax Payer."
The comments of the Messenger
were harsh enough to bring out
the author who was masked under
an assumed named and sailing
under "false color," as Mr. Greig
is neither a tax payer or a citizen
of St. Martinville, and when he
interferes in the affairs of the
town, he places himself in the pos
ition of an intermedler.
We know Mr. G(reig to be a na
tural and chronicle fault finder
who is apparently dissatisfied with
the world, and had we and the
public known who our critic was,
we would not have noticed it in
manner we did, because fault find
ing from him is simply natural.
We believe, however, that Mr.
Greig should have criticised
the present administration for its
omission and commission during
the past four years as they were
committed, then they might have
been of some good; but, to wait
just a month before the end of the
term of the present administration,
when none of the members have
announced as candidate, is uncall
ed for, out of place, and leave us
under the impression that there is
a political purpose in his vain
effort at criticism.
It was currently reported that
Mr. Greig and a few others have
been trying to form a town ticket
and without suuccess so far.
The Mayor and the council, who
are all business men have accepted
the position they now hold with
reluctance, and only at the urgent
request of the business men, tax
payers and those of our people
who thought the town affairs could
be improved upon. At the first
election when the opposition had
all the political machinery in
hand, they were defeated by two
votes, two years after when the
people of the town had a test of a
business administration the oppo
sition placed against the present
Mayor their strongest and most
popular man, and he was this time,
not defeated by the small majority
of two votes, but by 25 votes, and
after another two years, we find
that just three weeks before the
election which takes place on May
16th., notwithstanding the efforts
that are credited to Mr. Greig,
they have not put a ticket. Why?
Can Mr. Greig explain the reason
why he can't put out a ticket?
The present Mayor has been ap
proached by more than a hundred
of our best citizens urging him to
again become a candidate for the
office he nlow holds and which he
accepted only for the good of his
town, and is more flattered by
these expressions of confidence
and approval, than the c(ritic of an
outsider who tried to lead the peo
ple to believe he was a tax payer
and a citizen of the town, with a
just cause of complaint.
