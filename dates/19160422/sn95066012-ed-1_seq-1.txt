gate to Northampton Meeting
IRST GAME ON JUNE 15
Circuit Apparently Complete Without
Beninngton But Vermont Town
May Be Given an Opening.
There is to be a meeting at North
ampton Monday afternoon of the base
ball promotors who are Interested in
the organization of a six-club league of
which J. A. Zeller, tho former manager
f tho Pittsfield club in the Eastern
association. Is the moving spirit.
No definite decision relative to the
towns which will compose the new clr-
nit has been reached but the names of
the communities suggested so far
have been North Adams, Pittsfield,
Northampton, Greenfield, Fltchburg
and Leominster. That Mr. Zeller Is
not sure that all ot the towns in the
proposed list are ready for the or
ganization is indcait edayb twedwl5 ?
ganlzation is Indicated by a letter
which has been received from him by
one of the members of the former Ben
nington professional team inquiring
into tho prospects for baseball In this
illage. In bis letter Mr. Zeller re
quests that Bennington send a repre
sentative to the meeting at Northamp
ton for the purpose of learning what
the league promotors have to offer.
Just at present there does not ap
pear to be much baseball sentiment in
Bennington, but that fact does not es
tablish anything. The fans here were
always slow to wake up in the spring,
but when they havp become arou.sed
baseball history is evidence that they
remained in that condition until the
close of the season.
To reorganize the old association
and carry out a baseball campaign in
Bennington this year it would be
necessary to build a new park In Pow
nal and considerable preliminary work
wouui oe necessary, n would De a
considerable undertaking, but no more
of a task than has been accomplished
here in Bennington on a number of oc-
aBlons.
Mr. Zeller proposes to start the
schedule of the new league about June
15 when It would be possible to secure
college players for the several teams.
GIFTS OF MESSRS. PUTNAM
Magnitude Unapproached in Previous
History of the State.
Editor of the Banner: In a recent
issue of the Banner you made a state
ment, referring to the princely git't of
the late Mr. Henry W. Putnam to this
town, with which I must take issue.
In the short editorial you wrote tills
week, when word was received here
that In addition to the splendid gift of
the father, the sun makes as an add!
tlonal benefaction the wholly unexpect
cd sum of $:t0,ooo, you stated that "the
value of the water plant was variously
estimated at from $25),0u0 to M0,mi0
when as ti matter of fact it was of a
much greater value judging conserva
tlvely.
I arrive at this conclusion in view of
tho fact that the village now receives
an annual net return of $t",oiH), -and
that too with the water rates cut in
half for the benefit of our citizens. Of
course, It Is only just to assume that
Mr. Putnam received double the
amount above stated, less hnif the sum
netted from commercial buildings and
olllces which still pay full rates, having
given him a probable revenue of at
least $27,Oiio (minus taxes) per year
roughly $25,000, or lu other words, 5
per cent upon $500,000. Most flnan
clers would consider a practically sure
5 per cent Investment "gilt edged."
But there Is something more to be
considered In this connection and that
Is, the outlook for Bennington as a
community when this grent gift was
made, (the most splendid in the his
tory oi tne slate.) uie town then, as
now, was showing a very satisfactory
growth in all directions, both Indus
trially, and In a domestic way
Houses were springing up on all sides
new factories were being built, and
old ones brought, to life, population in
creasing in a steady and healthful
manner, making the outlook for the
water company's future very rosy.
Under these conditions, If Mr. Putnam
had offered the water works for sale
Instead of making them a free gift to
us, having been the unusually shrewd
financier he was, realizing the future
there undoubtedly was before the com
pany. I nm sure no sum less thun $r00
000 would have tempted him to allow
the plant to change hands. Most or
our ablest business men here quite
agreo with this statement.
And now comes fhe son with his
inagnlflclent gift of $;t0,000 with which
to build the Hospital, showing con
clusively how much in sympathy lie
was with his father's act lu donating
the water works, which naturally
would have been his. Do we fully
realize Just what these great gifts

U. S. NOTE NOT MADE PUBLIC
Sentiment in Higher Quarters Is That
Situation Is Extremerly
Crave.
Berlin, via London, April 22. Noth
ing has yet developed as a result of the
receipt of the American note to Ger
many concerning Germany's submarine
warlare. No expression of opinion is
obtainable from the foreign oflice
where absolute reticence Is main
tained.
Neither the note nor any reference
to it has been published in Germany,
and there is no intimation as yet when
the note will be made public. The cele
brations of Holy Week and of the Eas
tertide therefore are proceeding, un
disturbed by foreign complications.
The ministers and other officials who
were entitled to it, received a copy of
tho note this morning and were engag
ed during the day in studying tho do
cument
As far as the Associated Press has
been made acquainted with the senti
ment In higher quarters, it would be
wrong to regard the situation as any
thing but extremely grave. The note
probably will be answered some time
next week, after serious consideration
has been given the American conten
tion, but there is little hope that any
answer can go to the length demanded
by the Washington government, de
spite the fact that the government de
sires to maintain good relations with
tho United States. The sentiments are
against any further weakening of Ger
many s submarine campaign to say
nothing of an abandonment of it.
Washington,-' April 22 Embassador
Gerard at Berlin cabled the state de
partment yesterday that he had deliv
ered the American note on submarine
warfare to the German foreign ofHce at
4.30 o'clock Thursday afternoon. Sec
retary Lansing said later lie had not
been advised just when a reply might
be forthcoming. Other officials, how
ever, Indicated they expected it ny tno
middle of next week.
Embassador Gerard is known to
have entered into a brief conversation
with Foreign Minister von Jagow after
delivering the communication. Al
though the contents of a second mes
sage, received late yesterday from Mr.
Gerard were closely guarded, it was
understood the minister informed the
department he had been assured im
mediate consideration would be given
to tho note.
It became known last night that
several messages have been received
lrom Embassador Gerard during the
past day or two. It was stated
authoritatively, however, that they
transmitted only expressions of edi
torial opinion from German newspa
pers. Ihese editorial excerpts were
closely examined by officials in an at
tempt to gain some understanding of
tho state of German public opinion.
Dispatches, from the embassador are
lonjicd for momentarily to give defl
nite Information regarding the views
of German officials, the manner in
which the note was received and fore
casts of the action which would Im
taken by the German government in
response to the demand of the Unit
ed States that it declare and effect an
abandonment of the present methods
of conducting submarine warfare.
Count von Bernstorff, the German
embassador, was not in Washington
yesterday, lie left early yesterday
morning on a week-end trip. He Is
not expected to return to the capital
until Monday, unless Important dis
patches bearing on the submarine is
sue should be received before then.
The German embassy Is sending
many inrornmtive dispatches to Ber
lin. The majority of these sent so far
have contained interpretations of pub
lie and official opinion and the cm
bassador's own views on the situa
tion. It Is known that Count von
Bernstorff has strongly recommended
to his government that It so modify
submarine warfare ns to bring it with
in what the United States regards to be
the law.

will have this great good come to us
without the cost of one dollar to the

the relationship is sufficiently remote
to allow me to write this letter with
perfect propriety.

PURSUIT OE VILLA
IIOL'J flS ON
SGOTl'S REPORT
Chief of Staff Conferring With Gen.
funston
TROOPS MAY BE RECALLED
Army Officers of opinion that Punitive
Expeduie-n Will Soon
End.
San Antonio, Tex., April 21. Maj.-
Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff of
the United States army, and Maj. Gen.
Funston in charge of operations along
the frontier and in Mexico, personally
discussed the problems tonight which
have grown out of the punitive expedi
tion in pursuit of Villa.
Gen. Scott arrived from Washing
ton tonight and was' met by Geri. Fun
ston, the two going immediately to
Gen. Funston's headquarters at Ft.
Sam Houston. Gen. Scott professed
not to know whether the American
troops were to be recalled without hav
ing captured Villa. He was sent here
by Secretary of War Baker to discuss
the situation in detail with Gen. Fun
ston and to make the Secretary a per
sonal report. Gen. Scott does not in
tend going to El Paso or Columbus.
Officers here are convinced that Gen.
Scott soon will admit the futility of
confining the pursuit of Villa under
the existing circumstances.
It is believed at departmental head
quarters that the investigation uen.
Scott has been asked to make will
not keep him here more than a day
or two at most since there are in the
possession of Maj. Malvern-Hill Bar-
mini, Gen. Funston's chief of staff, the
details of the records of the campaign
since the troops crossed into Mexico
opposite Columbus. N. M., and this
was subpect to Gen. Scott s inspection
tonight.
Gen. Pershing's army continued its
inactivity today, awaiting instructions
from" Gen. Funston, which he was un
able to give pending the determination
and announcemnt of the Administra
tion's policy regarding the punitive ex
pedition. Secretary Baker s assertion
that there has been no change in this
respect and that the pursuit of Villa
would lie continued, was taken by mili
tary men to reflect the wishes of the
Administration, but. unless complete
changes in tactiss are used the con
tinuation of the pursuit of Villa can
not efficiently be continued, they de
clare. Gen. Pershing made a brief report
today to Gen. Funston informing him
of the position of troops, but no men
tion was made of activities either by
Mexican or American troops.
