Gen. Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff o
the United States army, nnd Maj. Gen
Funston, In charge of operations nlong
the frontier nnd in Mexico, personally
discussed the problems last night
which have grown out of tho punitive
expedition In pursuit of Villa.
General Scott arrived from Wash
lngton last night. General Scott pro
fessed not to know whether the Amer
ican troops were to be recalled with
out having captured Villa. Ho was
sent here by tho Secretary of War to
discuss the situation In detail with
General Funston and to make to the
secretary a personal report. - Whether
radical development in tho Mexican
situation is made early next week will
depend on how complete General Hiigl
L. Scott regards the Information which
General Funston Is nblo to lay before

Secretary Baker, after General Scott
renders his report, to decide upon
some new course of action. OUIccm
