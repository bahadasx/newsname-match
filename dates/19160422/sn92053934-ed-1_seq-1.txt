folnnihns, . M- April 22, A
lame detachment if infantry left
here today, it is believed, to
strenctlien the thin American line
of communication in Mexico. The
destination of the troops was not
announced and military headquar
ter would make no statements re
garding the movement.
Fan Antonio, April 22. Secretary
Baker should be In receipt of a report
before night from Major General
Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, that may
assist ihe administration In deciding
whether to withdraw the American
troops or send them farther into Mex
ico. Generals Scott and FunBton to
day will review in detail the history
of the punitive expedition's operations
fine entering Mexico almost six
weeks ago.
Vntil late last night the two officers.
Informally and in the presence of
other officers of lower rank, discussed
the developments of the pursuit of
Villa that began with prdmised co
operation by Carranza troops and
ended, or practically ended, with a
warning to Colonel W. QBrown at
Santa Cruz by a Carranza official that
he must not advance south of that
point.
The chief of staff was told of the
difficulties encountered in transport
ing supplies to the stations along the
line of communications and of the fail
ure to obtain proper service over rail
roads. Pershing Recommends Changes.
General Pershing's reports, which
are said to contain recommendations
that radical changes be authorized,
probably will be gone over carefully
today. Overnight dispatches from the
front did not indicate renewed offen
sive activity. The pursuit of the ban
dit chieftain remained practically at a
standstill. The Impression is gaining
strength at departmental headquar
ters that the troops will be withdrawn
from Mexico.
High army ofTicails here remained
almost indifferent to the suggestions
that the manifest hostility of Carranza
troops might bo due to work by
agents of Felix Diaz or those of any
other aspiring enemy of the de facto
government. Department of justice
agents have failed to discover any
tangible evidence that Diaz is mak
ing headway along the frontier and
all reports to army headquarters in
dicate that the officers of Carranza
garrisons who are showing so mark
ed an antagonism towards the Ameri
cans are wholly loyal to the first
chief. Whether they are acting under

HUNGARIAN PRESS
CRYING FOR PEACE
Newspapers of Hapslinrg Monarchy
Eager to Quit War Pay Tribute
to Asqnith Speech.
London, April 22. The Daily Tele
graph's Milan correpsondent says that
a significant symptom regarding the
Hapsburg monarchy is shown by an
outburst in the Hungarian newspapers
in favor of peace. Premier Asquith's
recent speech regarding--peace condi
tions, the dispatch says, has-been com
mended by Hungarians who are anxi
ous on account of German aggressive
ness respecting small nationalities at
the end of the war.
In connection with the visit to Ber
lin made by Baron Burian, Austro
Hungarian foreign minister, it is sug
gested that Germany proposed that
the Hapsburg monarchy should be di
vided into small autonomous states,
presumably in order that they may be
more easily swallowed up by Ger
many. The Slav nationalities, it is
hinted, are to be given the minimum of
liberty, Gallcia also receiving auton
omy. THE WAR TODAY
On the Russian front, the Ger
mans are active with their heavy
guns around the Ikskull bridge
head and farther south a German
assault was repulsed by the Rus
sians. Artillery duels are still In pro
gress on the Austro-ltalian front
and small infantry engagements
have taken place.
The Russians are still on the of
fensive against the Turks In the
Black Sea region of Asia Minor.
The British have met another
defeat in the Tigris region near
Felahle, according to Conslantl
nople. The report says the British
after heavy losses were compelled
to ret-eat westward.
Germany's reply to President
Wilson's note on submarine war
fare Is not looked for before the
middle of next week. It Is said at
Washington that Count von Bern,
storff, the German ambassador,
has advised his government to
modify Its methods of submarine
warfare to meet America's latest
demands.
The Germans have resnmed the
offensive before Verdun, putting
their Infantry In action on both
banks of the Meose but failing to
gain additional ground, according
to the French war office bulletin.
The principal attempt to ad
vance was made east of the Meuse
following an Intense bombard nfrnU
Paris reports that the French ar
tillery foiled the attempt and
caused the Germans heavy losses.
The scene of this fighting was be
tween the river and Fort Taux.
To the west, jnst beyond the
Mense, the Germans put liquid lire
into play In attacking the French
lines north of the Caorettes wood,
hut the assault Is declared to have
been barren of advantage to the
crown prince's forces.
In the Balkans a French aero
plane made a 40-mIIe flight from
the allied lines to Sofia and re

bombs on a Zeppelin shed in the

TO DOCUMENT
IS EXPECTED
Emperor William and His
Aids Are Studying the
American Paper.
PRESS IS RETICENT
Newspapers of Germany In
clined to Treat Subject
in Quiet Way.
Berlin, April 22, 10 a. m., Tla
London, 4:4. p. m. Germany's an
swer to the latest American note
is likely to be delayed by some
parleys and requests for further
Information on certain points, ac
cording to the Lokal Anzeiger
which says it learns that the note
is a decidely long one and that
It will be examined with German
thoroughness.
The American note Is now In
the hands of Emperor William,
Chancellor von Bethmann-Holl-weg
and General Ton Falkenhayn,
chief of the general staff at gen
eral headquarters.
A summary of the note was tele
graphed yesterday to general
headquarters and a courier, bear
ing the full text and the appendix,
was sent there by train.
The deliberations of the emper
or, the chancellor and the chief of
staff will determine the future
shaping of German-American re
lations. The note appears In the news
papers of this afternoon. All Is
calm here.
The Lokal Anzeiger's prediction
that the German reply will be de
layed is borne out by the fact that it
has been forwarded to general head
quarters. Prior to the publication of
the note the newspapers were permit
ted to print nothing concerning it ex
cept one dispatch sent from Wash
ington by an English news agency on
Wednesday. This message was cabled
before the day's session of congress,
and apparently was intended to pre
pare the people for the note itself.
Papers Brief in Comments.
The Lokal Anzeiger endeavors to
take a fairly optimistic view of the
situation, basing this on what it terms
the almost invariably misleading char
acter of English news dispatches. It
declares, however, that as England is
endeavoring to starve this country
Germany cannot give up the right of
self defense.
Other Berlin newspapers have pub
lished only a few lines of non-committal
comment. Of the prominent out of
town papers the Cologne Gazette re
fers editorially to the situation. It
says:
"An understanding between Germany
and America concerning the use of
submarines hitherto has not been
reached."
The Gazette repeats the frequently
heard attacks on American neutrality
in connection with the delivery of mu
nitions and the alleged complaisance
of the United States toward British
arbitrariness and concludes:
"American neutrality, carried out in
this manner, is not of such a kind that
Germany can sacrifice the most effec
tive means of its naval warfare to it."
Washington, April 22. With official
word that the American note has been
presented to the Berlin foreign office,
administration officials today momen
tarily expected definite advices from
Ambassador Gerard as to how the com
munication was received together with
some Indication as to the nature of the
German reply.
In reporting the delivery of the note
late Thursday afternoon. Ambassador
Gerard advised the state department
that he had afterwards conferred brief
ly with Foreign Minister Von Jagow.
It is said the ambassador Informed

Remand 8-Hour Day.
Pittsburgh, April 22. Pickets at all
entrances to the Westinghouse Elec
tric and Manufacturing company at
East Pittsburgh thjs morning pleaded
so successfully with workmen on
their way to the shops that leaders of
the strike, inaugurated yesterday to
enforce an eight-hour a day demand,
declared only 5,000 of the 18,000 em
ployes had entered. Great crowds or
strikers filled the streets leading to the
gates but there was no disorder. Or
ganization of the strikers Into locals
of the newly formed union was said to
be proceeding rapidly.
Inside the shops guards carefully
examined the lunch baskets of the
workmen who succeeded in passing
the pickets to prevent the introduction
of explosives. This regulation first
applied to the shell department, but
was later extended to include all the
shops.
Leaders of the strike said they
would organize a parade at noon to
bring out the workmen in a number
of factories which do not recognize
the eight-hours day. If they succeed
they said, they would have 28,000 men
on strike by night.
Would Kill Morgan.
New York, April 22. Harry L. New

Tombs police court. On the strength
of this document Newton was held for
examination next Tuesday.

Posse Hunts
Lone Bandit
in Wyominq
Rawlins, Wyo., April 22. A sheriff's
posse of two dozen "man hunters,"
mounted on fast horses early today
resumed with renewed vigor the chase
begun last' night for the bandit who
held up nearly fifty passengers on
Union Pacific limited No. 21, west of
Hanna, Wyo.
The robber is beliaved to be the man
who on April 5 last, held up the Union
Pacific Overland Limited near Corlett
Junction, Wyo., and on Feb. 9, per
formed a similar exploit near Green
River, Wyo., and in March robbed a
passenger train on the Oregon Short
Line near Roy, Utah.
The bandit, described as a tall,
handsome youth, boarded the train at
Greeley, Col. After a conversation
with the train's stenographer, he sat
down with the train guard. After an
hour's conversation the man drew two
revolvers and compelled the guard to
pass his hat before the passengers
who stood with hands in the air.
About $200 was gathered in the ob
servation car.
At the entrance to the second sleep
ing car, a brakeman and James Sher
lock, conductor, faced the robber.
Sherlock hesitated a moment to raise
his hands and the bandit fired. The
shot went wild. In the sleeper, the
brakeman was pressed into service
and another $200 was dropped into the
hat.
When the collection was finished,
the robber handed the guard a watch.
"There's the watch I got on my last
holdup and which I promised to return
this time," he said. "If you'll slow
down the train, I'll get off here, other
wise I'll go to Rawlins with you."
As the train slackened speed for
the Edson tunnel, the man dropped to
the ground and ran in the direction of
the "robber's roost" country in the
Elk mountains region.
The bandit, who robbed the Union
Pacific Overland limited at Corlett
Junction April 5, promised the porter
who collected for him on that occas
ion, he would return a watch he had
taken upon his next exploit.

On Charges of Defrauding In
surance Companies.
Chicago, April 22. Louis E. Lar
sen, formerly president of the L. E.
Larsen company, manufacturers of
stincils, is in custody today on charges
of having defrauded insurance com
panies of thousands of dollars by
arson.
The charges grew out of a fire
which destroyed the Larsen company
plant here three years ago. Since
that time Larsen has made his home
in Milwaukee, where he organized the
Milwaukee Steel Type and Die com
pany. The plant of his company, ac
cording to the state fire marshal's
office, was destroyed by fire in May of
last year and Larsen tried to collect
$23,000 insurance on the plant. An In
vestigation by the Wisconsin fire
marshal's office led to a confession on
the part of an employe who said he
was paid by Larsen to cause the fires.
Efforts were made to get Larsen to
come to Chicago for prosecution. But
these failed and Tuesday the warrant
for his arrest was sworn out and he
was arrested in Milwaukee. He ob
tained his release on bonds while
fighting extradition and came here last
night. His arrest at a downtown cafe
followed.
Larsen's attorney asserts there is no
foundation for the charge against his
client.
The fire which destroyed the Chi
cago factory was the fourth of sus
picious origin. According to the con
fession of the employe, the fires were
caused by spontaneous combustion,
brought about by wrapping manila
stencils in tight bundles and placing
them under wooden stencils in var
ious parts of the factory.
