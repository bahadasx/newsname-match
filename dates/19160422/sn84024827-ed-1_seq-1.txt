The sentiment is against any fur

WASHINGTON, April 21. Ambas
sador Gerard at Berlin, cabled the
Siate Depart'iient today that he had
delivered the American note on sub

office at 4:30 o'clock yesterday af

a reply might be forthcoming. Other
officials, however, indicated tney ex

Ambassador Gerard is known to
have entered into a brief conversation
with Foreign Minister von Jagow af

though the contents of a second mes
sage received late today from Mr.
Gerard, was closely guarded, it, is un

It wrs stated authoritatively, however,
they transmitted only expressions of
editorial opinion from German news
papers. These editorial excerpts were
closely examined by officials in an at
tempt to gain stome understanding of
the state of German public opinion.
Dispatches from the ambassador
are looked for n.rnentarily to give
definite information regarding the
views of German officials, the manner
in which the note was received and
forecast of the action which will be
taken by the German government in
response to the demand of the United
Slates that it dpclare and effect an
abandonment of the present methods
of conducting submarine warfare.
Count von Brrnstorff was not in
Washington today. He left early this
morning on a week-end trip. He is
not expected to return to Washington
until Monday, unless dispatches of an

submarine issues, should be received

The bandit, who' is believed by the
railroad officials to be the same'mati
who recently conimittted two similar
crimes in this section, is thought to
haveboarded the train at Greeley, . oi.
After encaging the guard in conver
sation for about an hour and a half.
the bandit drew two guns. The pas
sengers of the observation car drop
ped their valuables into a hat held
by the guard who then was compelled
to accompany the bandit throt'.gh . the

Reaching the last sleepei, the brake-n-an
was nressed into service. Aftet

guard and brakement. both of whom
were kept under cover, were dismiss

rapidly running train he rolled down
the embankment, regaind his feet
and disappeared into the hills of the
country.
A special train with a sheriffs'
posse left immediately tr. take tip the
chase from Edson.
Four hundred dollars is siid to

When the robber had finished hU
'task, he engaged the conductor in
conversation. "If you will stop the
train I'll leave you here; otherwise
I'll go on into Rawlings with you."
As the train slackened speed to
enter the Edson tunnel the robber
dropped to the ground.
Before leaving he handed the con
ductor a watch. "Here's the one I
got in my last hold-up and which I
promised to return this time."
A similar gift was tendered the por

WASHINGTON. April 21 President
Wilson and the cabinet discussed the
Mexican situation today but did not
decide on any course of action. Furth
er steps by the L'nited States toward
the pursuit of Villa or withdrawal or
the troops from Mexico will await a

chief of staff of the army, as to con

General Scott, who reached San

(ieneral Funston. was not expecting
to send a report on the situation until
tomorrow. His full report, upon which
a decision as to the s!ep to be taken
probably will not be made until his

make his investigation and return as
quickly as possicle. l!e cotild not in
