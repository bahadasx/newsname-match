Villa Dead Again.
Americans Kill Many Evidently Un
Armed Mexicans at Parral. '
It Is almost bCJTOtld belief tlint
a government IM its news sor-
ice bould be so hypocritical amj
deceptive, yet 1 want you oj keep
an eye on Mexico ami sec who it
is we arc after. A great lcal of
noise is being made about being
"after Villa,'' but the Kicker toW
you last week to watch and wee i1
we didn't net Caranilf we gci
anybody.
From the very start the kicker
has not had the slightest notion
that this government wanted
Villa. Tnert is evrr.v reason tu
believe that the Columbus affall
was planned and understood, and
that Its purpose was to give this
country on excuse to invade Mex
ico. The news from Mexico is vei
unreliable and conflicting, yet one
who understands how. can get
pretty close to the truth There
fore let us examine some of the
admitted facts.
The Villa band raided CollimbU-
.Without any Investigation or
any sort the Washington govern
ment ordered out troops to cross
the border and invade Mexico
WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO
A DECLARATION OP WAR I
Of cours. the newspapers then
lied under a full head of steam
niH na that Carranta had
agreed to it all and that his
forces would co-operate with ours
Then, the next day. the newspa
pers would lie some more and say
that Carranza was threatening UK
and would co-operate with Villa
Tlic truth is that there is more
brains in the Carranza cabinet
than in our own. Carranza knew
that he could not successfully
fight the United States, Just as
well as he knew that the Mexi
can revolutionists had millions nl
sympathise It in this country
Therefore the only thing he could
do was to sit tight until some
thing happened until the purpose
of the invasion revealed itself
And it happened
Last week our troops are re
ported to have killed lT.O unarm
ed citizens not soldiers, mind you
in the Mexican city of Parral
The press dispatches did not say
that the killed were unarmed,
but circumstances prove it. The
report said there was RUT ONE
AMERICAN KILLED Had the
Mexicans been armed, or had they
expected trouble, the result Would
have been different.
A later report gives the number
of Americans killed as two
It may be a month before .1
small per cent of our people get
the truth about this affair. They
who read only capitalist papers
will never get it. To me It ap
pears as Just such another stunt
as when we sailed into Vera Cruz
under the pretense of wanting
Heurtn to salute our flag. The
people of Vera Cruz knew noth
ing about it and were taken un
awares. Schools were in session,
and when the teachers heard tin
firing they dismissed school so the
children could go to their par
ents On their wa.V home some of
the UttlS tots were shot and killed
lv our brave heroes.
Now let us examine this alleged
Villa hunt. On March 9 Villa and
I is bunch of a few hundred men
were in Columbus where Col, Slo
cum was stationed with 3U1) men
At different points along the bor
der almost the entire U S. arm.',
v, us stationed to prevent Just
what Villa did.
itliout any official in ?Stiga-
tion the Washington governmen
immcdiately ordered the pui
a
of Villa. 1 don't think then
been any official report Of
nnlumfaua affair to the wai
has
the
de-
rartment to this day.
But Villa gets away. Hbw? He
cannot be located Why'.' Was
there any time during the five
years of Mexican revolution that
Villa's whereabouts were un
known for so much as a week.'
They tell us that he has fled to
the mountains ami that he, is so
familiar with them that his hid
ing places cannot be located
These mountains with which Villa
is so familiar are in Northern
Mexico. Then what are our
troops doing at Parral, 370 miles
from our border?
Then let us look at it in another
light. It might be possible for
on man to hide in the mountains
for some time. But how about
an army? We have Just as high
and just as rugged mountains in
this country us in Mexico. Do
you believe that an army of sev
eral hundred men could hide any
where in the United States with
out leaving the least trail or
trace as to their whereabouts?
Under the pretense of surround
ing Villa, out troops are being
scattered all over Mexico WITH
HEAVY ARTILLERY. Who ever
heard of anybody chasing a
mountain bandit with heavy ar
tillery? But the Parral massacre has
given the Carranza government
the opportunity to speak, and the
Washington government must
now show its hand. In a very
polite but firm note the Carranza
government calls attention to the
presence of this heavy artillery
and its utter uselessness in the so
called "punitive expedition," and
iequests that the American forces
be Immediately withdrawn, ex
cept 1,000 cavalry which may
continue the persuit of Villa if it
latently Villa they are after,
This means a show-down And
the Washington government sput
ters much.
It isn't as easy to benevolent
ly assimilate weaker people noto
nsdt was 17 years ago Many of
our people me doing a little
thinking, Then the blowing up of
the Maine by agents of the I'hin
dcibund. as many believe, and ;
concerted yelp, the next morning,
by the capitalist press, net tin
whole COUntry aflame.
Providence," ami "Destiny, and
"the White man's burden'' all de
manded that we remove the yoke
of Spain from the oppressed Cu
bans and Fillipinoes. And after
we. assisted by the Cubans and
Fillipinoes had removed the Span
ish yoke, we were horrified nt our
ungrateful allies who attempted
to resist the careful adjustment
of our own yoke.
In screaming head-lines acfoM
the fiont j aue. Monday morning's
kept newepapers announced that
Pan CO Villa was dead again.
This time they s ire had him -and
the reports were generally
credited as "official." And the
minutest details wen given as to
how it all happened Listen to
this, taken from an El Paso diS
j a ti ll :
Villa's body was taken out or
its lonely grave near San Francis
co Rurja, and positively Identi
fied, according to numerous OF
FICIAL and private messages
The bandit died from gangrene as
a result of a wound in his left
knee."
Then the dispatch went on to
tell how it all happened. About
three we?ks ago Villa attempted
to steal a pretty Mexican girl
ami the father shot him in the
knee. The father was 'immediate
ly shot nnd Villa got away with
the girl, cursing the Americans, ol
course. Gangrene set in and Villa
died.
Oh, it was a convincing story
one calculated to make Rube sit
up and listen. They even told
how a native doctor probed and
dug out the schattered bones, nnd
how Villa didn't even grunt nor
bat an eye. They told how Villa's
leg swelled until he had to split
1 Is pants leg. and there was the
swelled leg and split pants when
thi'V.to'k him uj' nit of the
grave!
Who could doubt such an ac
curate story unless he under
stood the liar's? Villa was bur
ied with his boots on, and th i
bedy was on its way to Jaurei
under military escort, so that it
could be identified by Americans
Columns of such slush also ap
peared from Washington to the
effect that semi-official news of
the finding of Villa's body had
been received there, and that' if
the body was positively Identified
as that of Villa, our troops would
he immediately withdrawn.
I shall comment no further nt
this time. But I am convinced it
is all a lie out of whole cloth
Tuesday morning's papers all but
admitted it. They said the wire
were down and they were unable
to get any Information, but that
"the hopes 01' VilHt's death dwin
dled." There were two things j 1st
little more consplcious to me than
anything els1 in Mondays pages ol
hog-wash, One was that Villi
was continually cursing the
Americans, The other was that
the Washington authorities would
withdraw the troops from Mexico
if the body proved to be thai of
ilia.
Next week I will tell you the
reason for trying to impress theso
upon the American people.

The good and pious and law

are millions of duped people who

"Surrounding all this clandes

"Hotels were found that either

I RAILROAD RECEIVERSHIPS
j Fiom the Milwaukee Leader,
j The United .states Government
j is now operating railways
having a milage ol 4i.!88 miles
and capitalized at .i',L'04.000,000
. The so roads are being conducted
; by federal courts because of the
failure or private operation,
1 Nominally these roads are oper-
ited by receivers because they
! are bankrupt. These receivers
! are appointed by federal courts
and are under the dlreo tsuptr
'vision of the Judges oT these
I courts who are responsible for
the operation of the roads.
I No one has ever suggested tha;
, federal Judges are -elected bc-
loause of their ability to operate
railroads, although they are fre
quently chosen for their willing-
ness to let the railroads operate
j them. Nevertheless whenever a
railroad is looted by its owners
lor for any other reason fails to
make a profit, it is handed over
to a federal court for manage
ment. The court operates the road un
til It is once more profitable and
then returnes it to the owners.
At the present time the mileage
operated by the courts is greater
than the total railway mileage of
any other country In the world
except European and Asiatic Rus
sia combined. It is far greater
than the amount operated by any
nation in the world having gov
ernment owned railroads.
Yet the wise men of business in
this country never tire of warn
ing of the danger of government
owned and operated railways.
ir you want the truth, you must
read the unmuzzled Kicker.
Stick to the unmuzzled Kicker.
