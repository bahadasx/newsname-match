EL TASO. Tex., April 2:. Humors
re current here ot fighting nt Casas

can nd American troopii. Neither
Bri. Can. Bell nor Gen. Ciavlra, Car
raoiz&'s commander nt Juarez, han
received confirmation.
The last report? showed only a few
hundred Carranza soldiers nt Casa
Orandcs, which has been the chief
American baso of supplies in Mexico
and tho point of greatest dancer to
Can. Pershing's detachments if taken.
The. American fores between Casus

patched declare tho entire Carranza
trarrtson at Colonl.i Morales, In tlm
Ktato of Sonorn, has suddenly cvacu
Btod that city and rushed to Parr.il.
Constant shifting of Carraiua's
forces In Northern Mexico points to a
tcady closing In on Gen. Pershing's
detachment. Tho latest move of the
Carranzlstas to menace tho Americans
Js tho statement mado by Gen. G.ivir.i
til at ho has divided his forces In
Juarez and will send part of his
troops to Madera, Chihuahua, "to
malio stronger tho lines of Carranza
extending north and south through
Western Mexico."
Madera Is on the Mexico North
western Hallroad. nouth of Casa
Grandca, thu chief lleld supply base
of Qen. Pornhlng'3 urmy. A force
cutting tho lino at Madera would cut
Af from huppIIch all American camps
aouth of Madera and north of Uachl
Elba. Gen. Pershing has left an Infantry
command of unknown numbers at
kladera, which could give a good ac-
lount ot itself tu tho event of hus-
itilltlce.

Germany' answer it llktly to

on certain point, according to
tho Lokal Anzeiner.
"We insist on tho right to hit out

"An orjreement with the United
