Many Children Die of Pre
ventable Causes.
"Of the 300,000 deaths of children
every year, half were absolutely un
necessary tnat is preventable. The
causes of these deaths were many.
There was the ignorance of mothers.
There was the unhealthy food, the im
pure milk, the unnecessary exposure to
the heat of summer. . There was the
dosing with patent medicines. There
was the exposure t j the cold. There
was under-nutrition. Against all these
an encouraging fight has been made.
Many books have been written for
mothers. Pure milk stations have
been opened in the cities. City boards
of Child-Hygiene, have been established.
(In 1914 the city of New York appro
priated $168,000 for child-hygiene and
spent 5235,000 on a Children's Court
Building.) The schools have tried to
reach the parents through the children.
Physicians have devoted much more
time and attention to the preserving of
the health of children than they used
to do." Literary Digest. March 25.
Government experiment stations are
located in various places all over the
land to determine the conditions under
which the various crops may be grown
to the best advantage. Agricultural
Colleges are reaching an advanced
stage of efficiency. Much has been
learned about producing the most vig
orous and healthful stock of all kinds
for the farm.
Millions are being expended along
these lines each year for the financial
welfare of the country.
Great care and attention has for
many years been given these things,
and great progress has been made. We
have better wheat, better service, cat
tle and horses. The enormous increase
of the wealth of the nation is largely
due to these things.
The real reason for which we have
worked so zealously to improve these
things has not been for ourselves so
much as for our children. Every fa
ther and mother knows this.
While we have learned all these
things about plants and animals what
have we learned about caring for our
babies? And our boys, and girls?

little children: Can
The School Bond Proposition.
The Board of Education, after a care
ful study of the present and , future
needs of the public schools of Hays,
submits to the voters of this district the
proposition of a bond issue for a new
building "as the only feasible solution of
adequate school facilities for the chil
dren of Hays.
We have no personal interests in the
matter different from what every other
citizen ought to feel. But we have a
public duty to perform a3 school officials
whom the voters have charged with the
administration of the public schools to
the best interests of all concerned.
There is no trust more sacred and none
more worthy the best thought and ser
vice of a citizen than the welfare of the
children. It is in this spirit that we
are trying to serve this community
without emolument or personal gain.
We feel it is due the voters to state
clearly the proposition before them,
and the complete plans of the Board.
The bond proposition is. a part of a
general plan of providing for the educa
tional interests of Hays, both for the
present and the future. This is the
only way to approach civic questions.
"Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof" is a poor motto for the admin
istration of public affairs. Our plans
involve the following: A fifty thousand
dollar bond issue for the erection and
equipping of a modern, up-to-date, fire
proof high school building just west of
the present school building, facing
south.
The acquiring of the remainder of the
block of ground upon which the present
building stands.
Leave the present building stand for
a grade building. With some repairs
and refurnishing it will serve the grades
nicely for several years.
As soon a3 the school population in-

That is a conservative estimate of the
sacrifice we make each year because
we use less intelligence and give less
thought to the raising, feeding and
growing of children than we do to
plants and animal3.

In later years when the necessity de

This in brief, i3 the policy which we

We can estimate the amount ot sick

or middle adult life, due to the same
cause.
An inestimable amount of disease of
every nature originates in infancy and
chilhood. Think of the hundreds of
falls babies and children have. Think
also of how little knowledge the . aver
age father or mother bas as to what
food is proper. Coffee, tea, meat, po
tatoes, given readily to baby because
he wants it. Thus by satisfying a ba
by's whim overworking the immature
digestive tract, in attempting to digest
the food of a laboring man; to such an
extent that conditions are produced
which later develop into Chronic indi
gestion, constipation, or appendicitis.
All physicians, who follow the trend
of the times, realize that the only real
way xo combat disease is to prevent it,
and the only way to prevent it is to re
move abnormal conditions in children,
which later, perhaps not until they are
grown, develop into disease.
Osteopathy has been the vanguard in
advocating the prevention of ill health
By having children properly cared for
and discovering abnormal conditions in
children which would later cause much
suffering; perhaps early death.
Close attention should be given to
many little troubles in children which
are too af ten thought trinial but which i
later become grave.
Osteopathic physicians are giving
special attention to children because
they realize therein lies the great field
of prevention of disease and death.

is in use. Each teacher in the grades
has from fifteen to thirty more children
