[Little Hope in Washington That Germany Will
Meet the Demands Made in Sub
marine Question.
Announcement of the application of
Kthe so-called Mediterranean pledges
[to the English death zone probably
would not meet the American de
Imands, it is said, in as much as this
[government feels these pledges have
[not been effective.
If Germany agrees to follow the
[visit and search provisions and to
[provide ample safety for passengers,
[America will accept it.
But Germany must adhere to her
pledges.
The problem thus comes down to a
I question of whether Germany is
ready for abandonment of her pres
ent submarine war which in any
event must be the first step toward a
new policy and the healing of strained
relations.
Authorities feel that the German
admiral's statement is indicative of a
firm position oil Germany's part, of
an unwillingness to make her prac
tices square with American demands.
At the same time he apparently de
sires to shift the burden of responsi
bility to the United States should
there be a break.
The department anticipated today
that it soon will have Ambassador

WASHINGTON. April 22.—Little
bope that Germany would meet fully
he American submarine demands,
iras apparent here today.
Statements of Admiral Von Holt-|ment
endorff, German admiralty staff chief
given to the United Press in Berlin,
iirnished the state department the
Srst definite line on the German offi
cial attitude.
The conclusion was drawn by some
officials that perhaps modification of
Itbe sternness of the American de-|
iands offered the only chance of
avoidirfg a diplomatic break. Such a
notification is out of the question,
bey said.
It is indicated officially this gov
ernment will leave to Germany the
question of whether she can conduct
irarfare without violating intarna
luonftl law and still make it effective.
Tetary Lansing is known to feel
at if Germany applies the rules of
visit and search and provides for
afety of passengers, the undersea

campaign will be robbed of its de
Istructiveness—and hence, its effective

Anzeiger Predicts Agreement.
[By ^arl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, April 22.—American offi
cials here today were confronted with
the problem of what to do with Amer
icans arriving In Berlin from interior
cities of Germany because of reports
that Germany and the United States
are on the verge of a break.
United States Consul General Lav
held a long conference with Ambas
sador Gerard on this subject this
morning. Gerard said he had received
no instructions from Washington re
garding the 700 Americans now in
Germany.
The Berlin Lokal Anzeiger, influen

the largest circulation in Germany,

controversy is possible despite pessi
mistic reports. The Lokal Anzeiger
has not thus far examined the text of
President Wilson's latest note.
"We insist on the right to hit our
foes in the weakest spot," said the
Lokal Anzeiger.
"Nevertheless, we want peace with
the great people across the water,
just as we have not wanted war with
our present foes.
"An agreement with the United

By many military critics Ven Der
Goltz was regarded before the war as
German's greatest soldier, despite the
reverses suffered hy the Turks in
the Balkan wars after he had recon
structed the Ottoman army. He or
ganized Germany's secret defenses
along the Russian border and it was
popularly believed would lead Ger
many's armies into Russia when the
war broke out.
Von Der Goltz was a bluff warrior
who feared no superiors. He was
not in good favor with the kaiser, it
was generally understood at Berlin.
After serving a brief term as military
governor of the occupied portion of
Belgium, he was sent to Turfcev
where he became active minister of
war and supervised the reconstruc

PARIS, April 22.—Using liquid fire,
the Germans last night hurled heavy
forces against the French front north
west of Verdun. They succeeded In

the whole front from the Meuae east

the fort, prior fo an assault on the
fort itself, which occupies a position
on a stony height with precipitous
sides.
A violent fire from French guns sta
tioned In Fort Vaux and from con
necting works, prevented the Ger
mans from emerging from their
trenches. The artillery fire was un
.usually effective, the Germans losing
heavily.
The fact that there Is no shortage
In French artillery, despite the large
number of guns massed at Verdun,
was demonstrated by today's official
communique. The war office reported
that French artillery has co-operated
with the British in the recent fight

NEW YORK, April 22—About an
old. rambling colonial house secluded
on the banks of the Hudson river
near West Point, centered a search
today for the body of Dorothy Arnold,
missing New York heiress whose dis

of Europe and Amcrica.
In a cold drizzle of rain, scores of
curious tourists made their way over
the roads from West Point to gaze
upon the bleak old house. Convict
Glennorris in the Rhode Island peni
tentiary says it holds the secret of
the young woman's disappearance.
Inspector F&urot, in New York, is

Digging Up Cellar of Old House in
Search of Dorothy Arnold's Body
ris claimed the body was buried, aft
er Williams visited the convict in the
Rhode Island penitentiary, it was
learned today.
Williams is thoroughly familiar
with the West Point district and was
surprised at the knowledge Glennor
ris had of the location of different
land marks.
"Williams did not tell Glennoris
that he knew the West Point sec
tion," said Faurot, "but Just let him
tell of different land marks he was
acquainted with. The convict de
scribed the old colonial house, how
the roads lay and the house across
the way in which the light was burn
ing. Then he told of the night trip
in the automobile during which the
girl's body was carried away and
buried.
"He told Williams that statements
that the girl's face was veiled were
incorrect. He said he saw her face
distinctly and that it was so strik
ingly like that of the pictures he had
seen of Dorothy Arnold that he asked
who she was. Glennnoris then said
he was told the girl was Dorothy Ar
nold. He said he had no idea how
she came to her death.
"Going to West Point, we located
the hcu-e answering Glennorris' gen
eral description. We found that the
cellar floor had apparently been re
paired at one spot since it was first
laid. We began digging there. After
going down to considerable depth, we
struck a sewer pipe. That's all we
found."

CANNiEL.TON, Ind., Aprfl 22.—
Seeking happiness, George F. Fluhrer,
wealthy Denver, Colo., man, is speed

wife whom he Kidnaped from hor
mother. Outwitting a group of farm

on the Ohio river, in a chartered mo

bulance and with a corps of doctors
and nurses, raided the home of his
mother-in-law, Mrs. Philip Dick.
Fluhrer came east when a dlvoroo
stilt asking for $50,000 alimony was
filed against him in Denver, to learn
whether it was done on his wife's
initiative. He found his wife still
loved him, he said, but was detained

Guadalajara penitentiary, it is report
ed. They are said to have conspired
against the first chief, presumably
with the Felix Diaz party. The Car
ranza government is believed to be
making wholesale arrests. Many oth
er executions throughout the republic
are reported. The determination of
the defacto government to sweep
away opposition Is also indicated in
the order to deport antagonistic for
eigners.
The Miexican revolutionists station
ed in the United States are reported
active despite the watch kept over
them by the American secret service.
The Felix Diaz movement is believed
to be the most formidable. It appar
ently has unlimited money back of it
and awaits the withdrawal of the Am
erican troops from Mexico to launch
a revolution.
Reports are in circulation that both
the Carran/.a government and the Diaz
movement have used German money.
Charges that Villa's Columbus raid
was inspired by German agents,
brought the statement from Carranza
Consul Garcia that he had heard re
ports that Villa was financed by Ger
mans to bring war between the Unit
ed States anu Mexico to keep America
out cf tho European trouble. Garcia
said secret service men were investi
gating ail these reports. The rumors
were not officially confirmed.
That Villa has escaped danger of
immediate capture seems assured. If
he has not reached southern Mexico
it is because he preferred to sit with
in tantalizing distance of the Ameri
can troops. The expedition is mark

Soott-Kunston conferences in San An

Among these questions is just what
the attitude of Carranza towards

to come in of increasing mobilization
