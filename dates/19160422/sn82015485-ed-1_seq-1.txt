Mr. Woertndyke is in the state -to
aid in the Securing of the - quota- for
Kansas of", the-fire -million' voters"
pwhicu varius organizations-Ace-, en
deavoring to. enroll for national ' prp-
jibiLih.. It is national .movement
to secure five million vters who. will
agree to support only such candidates
and political parties ' as stand com
mitted by -state - and . national plat
form declaration for the - complete
overthrow of the liquor traffic. It
is said approximately 1,230,000 have
thus far been obtained. It is con
tented that five million voters stand
ing together on such. a proposition is
sufficient to change the policy of ' our
goverment from license and protec
tion to national prohibition by elect
ing ah administration which, stands
committed to such a principle. Ex
Governor Hanly, Eugene Chafin and
other noted , men say the success of
the movement will end the legalized
liquor traffic in the United States.
Among the organizations which have
largely contributed thus far in the
enrollment of the voters are the Fly
Squadron of American, the - Prohib
ition League of America, the Prohib
ition Party Committees, the Women's
Federated Prohibition Clubs ard the
Christian Endeavor Society. About
one hundred prominent men, about
fifty of whom are now or have been
either congressmen or , governors,
have agreed to donate a, month of
their time in pushing the movement.
It is hoped to secure such an enor
mous number of signers by next Jane
as will iaapeii the political parties to
adopt a platform containing a pro
hibition plank. Leaders in all par
ties favoring such a plank a ill work
for its adoption by their respective
party conventions. One former con
gressman says failure to secure such
a plank in the platform of the, var
ious parties may induce literally hun
dreds of delegates to bolt their con
ventions and go with a body of voters
which will adopt such a plank. A
conference of the signers of the Five
Million -Movement-will be held " in
Minneapolis, "St Paul, Minnesota, the
13th of July after the old parties
have held their conventions. It is
anticipated the conference wit! be
a factor of no mean importance in
the fall elect'on and will mark an
epoch in the prohibition reform.
An attendance of upwards of 50,000 is
expected will attend. Prominent
men of various party affiliations and
leaders in the religious, educational
and civic life of the country wilt par
ticipate. -
