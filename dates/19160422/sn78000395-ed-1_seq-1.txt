Shorter Workday Will Cost
Railroads Little.
ANSWER CHARGE MADE
BY RAILWAY MANAGERS
Officials Resort To Old Cry To
Protect Investments of
Widows and Orphans.
CLEVELAND, O., April 20.—Op­
ponents of the eight-hour day move­
ment for railway freight train crews
are attempting to make capital out
of the statement that "35 per cent
of all railway stock pays no divi­
dends," declare the representatives
of the four big railroad brotherhoods.
Sympathy is desired for the poor
stockholder who might suffer a de­
crease in his dividends if better
working conditions are granted to
the wage earners of the railways. It
is a fallacy of course, to think that
the granting of better hours will re­
sult in a decrease in dividends, but
that is the argument that is being
put up by the railroads.
In Much Better Shape.
As far as dividends are concerned
railway stock is in much better shape
than it ever was, and when it is as­
serted that 35 per cent of all railway
stock pays no dividends, it should
also be shown that in 1897 only 30
per cent of all railway stock paid
dividends, and in 1914, which was
the last available figures, 67 per
cent of all railway stock paid divi­
dends. There has been a gradual in­
crease in the per cent of dividend
paying stock since 1897 and this in
spite of the fact that there has been
a large increase in the amount of
stock issued, much of which repre­
sented no capital investment what­
ever but was issued to pay bonuses,
commissions, etc., given to such fi­
nancial manipulators as operated the
New Haven, Frisco and Rock Island
deals.
It should be remembered that in
the total amount of railroad stock
outstanding there is considerable that
is not expected to pay dividends, such
as switching lines, belt line transfers,
etc.. which are constructed only to
facilitate the handling of traffic in
and around terminals.
Pay Better Now.
Interstate Commerce commission
statistics show that there has been
an increase over the period from
1897 to 1916, regardless of any in­
crease in the total volume of stock—
that there has been a very large in­
crease in the proportion that pays
dividends. These statistics assume
the total amount of stock to have
been 100 per cent each year, from
1897 to 1914, inclusive, and they
show what proportion of this total
for each year was dividend paying
stock, thus indicating the relation of
the stock that paid dividends to the
total stock outstanding for each year.
Thus, a more detailed examination
of the official statistics of the Inter­
state Commerce commission, as re­
gards the dividend and non-dividend
paying stock of the railways of the
United States does not give the im­
pression that the opponents of the
eight-hour day movement are so de­
sirous of instilling into' the public
mind.
They Are All Getting More.
To say that "35 per cent of the
railway stock paid no dividend" in
1914 does not, in the slightest degree,
indicate that the stockholder of
American railways has not fared well
with his investment. On the con­
trary, it has been conclusively proven
that the condition of this stockholder
has considerably improved over the
period of years.
As conclusively shown the railroad
corporation itself, and not the widows
and orphans which the railway offi­
cials would try to have us believe own
the stock of the railroads.
LOW WAGES FLAY
The United States Public Health
Service has just published a startling
expose of American industrialism and
its blighting, death-dealing effect on
the lives and happiness of the 30,000
000 American wage earners.
Strain and overwork in the shop
and factory, poverty and anxiety at
home, are breaking down the health
of American workers and sending
millions to their graves before they
have approached old age.
All Brushed Aside.
All the platitudes of the political
orator and the shallow patriot are
swept aside by the facts of science
as marshalled in Public Health Bul­
letin No. 76, entitled "Health Insur­
ance, Its Relation to the Public
Health*." The authors are Dr. B. S.
Warren, surgeon. United States Pub­
lic Health Service, and Edgar Syden
stricker, public health statistician in
the same service. The bulletin em­
bodies the result of an investigation
undertaken for the Commission on
Industrial Relations and continued
for the Public Health Service. Copies
may be had on application to the
government printing office in Wash­
ington.
The Warren-Sydenstricker report
concludes with.a plan for compulsory
health insurance for wage earners,
to be administered by the state and

SHIELDS BILL: BIG
Declare -£\sen Attempt to Get Natural
^sources of People Into
Private Hands.
SENATE PASSES BILL
FIGHT IS NOW IN HOUSE
People Back Home Can Prevent
Congress from Giving Away
Valuable Rights.
By DANTE BARTON.
I An enormous grab at the public
I wealth has recently been made by
bi£ corporations with the help of the
United States Senate.
The Shields Water Power Bill,
which has passed the senate and is
now in the house of representatives
of congress, is the worst attempt to
get the natural resources of the peo­
ple into private hands that has been
pulled off in years.
Unless the people back home heat
this iniquitous grab in the house of
representatives the biggest remaining
source of public wealth will pass into
the hands of private r-ivilege. WITH­
OUT COMPENSATION AND FOR­
EVER.
The bill will give away all the
water power of all the navigable
rivers of the United States.
The natural wealth thus to be lost
to the people if this Shields bill goes
through the house would pay the cost
of any sort of "preparedness." It
would pay the cost of such rightful
"preparedness for peace" as would
safeguard the health of workers, at
least lessen the evils of unemploy­
ment, and give the great body of the
people a real stake in their govern­
ment.
People Should Make Fight.
"Vigorous and unrelenting prose­
cution to regain all land, water
power and mineral rights secured
from the government by fraud" was
recommended bv the main, or Manly,
report of the Commission on Indus­
trial Relations.
"The enormous Incomes and in­
heritances that imperil our Republic
and the enormous power over others
that go with these fortunes," said
Frank P. Walsh, in a recent state­
ment issued by this Committee on
I a el at on a re
the unnatural possession by a Com.
narative few of our mines and our
highways of commerce and of most
of our richest farming lands."
Is this grabbing game to go on for­
ever? Why does congress stand for
it and take a hand in it?
The people, the workers, can stop
this grab if they w*ill act quickly and
protest to their congressmen. What
is left of the people's earth here in
America, and what can be taken
hack from privilege grabbers, should
be controlled and developed by the
people for the people.
ERIE R. R. CARPENTERS
STRIKE FOR WAGE RAISE
MIDDLETON, N. Y,, April 20.
—Seven hundred carpenters and la­
borers employed on the Erie & West­
ern Railroad between Middletown
and Mayfield went on strike today.
They demand an increase in wages of
5 cents an hour. The company has
offered them an increase of iy»
cents.
Other departments of the railroad,
totaling 5,000 men, including the ma­
chinists, may become involved.
STEEL EMPLOYES WIN STRIKE.
CHICAGO, April 20.—-Several
hundred steel workers' helpers, em­
ployed by the Western Stefel Car and
Foundry company at Hegewisch sus­
pended work to enforce wage in­
creases from 20 cents an hour to 35
cents. After a short conference the
company compromised on a 10 cent
increase.
ning indictment of American social
and industrial conditions contained
in its impressive array of indisput­
able facts and figures.
By combing all the reports made
by state and federal investigators
and those employed by reputable
universities and societies during the
past ten years, the government ex­
perts have proved ten times over
their contention that low wages are
playing havoc with the lives and
health of the workers.
Prepare Labor First.
After reading this government re­
port, no man or woman could longer
fail to realize that preparedness
means radical changes in the eco­
nomic condition of the wage earners
before it means anything else that
the losses on European battlefields
and the danger of foreign aggression
are less than the day-by-day slaugh­
ter being wrought here at home by
our prevailing industrial and eco­
nomic regime.
Supplementing this committee's
estimate that 250,000 adults are
killed and 4,700,000 wounded each
year .by poverty and preventable dis­
ease, the report finds that "each of
the 30,000,000 workers in the United
States loses on the average about
nine days every year on account of
sickness alone."
Having established the prevalence
of disease among wage earners, the
government experts proceed to Its
7 zvw- -/v.
A whir of dust is sweeping the hill,
Between the gray dawn and the huge black
mill.
There\s adrift of rage and of skinny bones,
With skelton feet on the ruthless stones.

This ghostly rear-guard of the night,
Wearily treading the trail of the dark,
Arousing the morn before the lark
Organized labor in Minnesota is beginning an aggres­
sive campaign for state insurance. Workingmen ask
that the present compensation act be repealed and in
lieu thereof that the state create and administer a fund
for the purpose of compensating all workingmen who
may become injured at their occupations.
This fund is to be raised by levying a specific tax
on industry, the rate thereof to be based upon the
hazard of each occupation. Every dollar then paid by
employers of labor for insurance will find its way into
the pockets of injured workingmen or the dependents
of workingmen who lose their lives at their work.
By a such plan it is believed the compensation will
be adequate to sufficiently and justly pay for all ac­
cidents without imposing too great a hardship upon
industry. The cost of administration, it is proposed,
will be paid by general taxation from the saving to
be effected by removing from the courts the handling
of accident cases.
If organized labor can succeed in inducing the leg­
islature to pass a state insurance bill it will mean the
end of' employers' liability companies in Minnesota, and
with them will go the claim agent, the one remaining
evil in the accident business.
Since workingmen's compensation became effective
in Minnesota private insurance companies have been
reaping bountiful harvests. As under employers' lia­
bility the claim agents play for the last dollar that an
injured workingman is willing to give to get a settle­
causes and devote 28 pages to what
is in effect an indictment of Ameri­
can industry. The causes of disease
are given as follows:
The occupational hazards
vof
dis­
ease irregularity of employment
unhealthful conditions of living the
employment of women in industry
under modern conditions of work,
particularly of married women and
the economic disadvantage at which
a large proportion of wage workers
and their families are placed as the
result of low wages and insufficient
annual income.
What Causes Disease?
The report makes it clear that
"economic disadvantage" as a cause
of disease and overshadows all the
rest For example, inadequate diet
is set down as the first of "unhealth­
ful conditions of living/' and the re­
port says:
"Income statistics published by
fedferal and state governments in the
last few years indicate_ that a con­
siderable proportion of the families
of wage workers have not been able
to maintain a diet that will provide
for proper nourishment.
"A, larger proportion can maintain
an adequate diet only at the sacri­
fice of healthful environment and of
other items which go to constitute a
reasonable standard of living. There
can be no doubt that nourishing food
is sacrificed in a large number of
instances |n order to obtain some of

the comforts and amuse,ments and to
gratify some of the wants which are
entirely natural and to be expected
of the average American.
"An examination of a number of
studies of the budgets of American
workingmen's families indicates that
the point of adequate subsistence is
not reached until the family income
is about 1800 a year. Less than half
of the wage earner's families in the.
United States have an-annual income
of that size, according to all-statistics
of income for workingmen's 'families,

"If this be true, over half of the
families of American wage earners
must either lower their standard of
life in other respects in order to have
an adequate diet, or make sacrifices
in their diet in order to secure
healthful housing, favorable com­
munity environment, and a few of
the reasonable comforts.
"The effect of the rapid increase in
the retail prices of fpods that have
been found to constitute the diet of
workingmen's families can not be
overlooked as an additional factor in
this connection. Between 1900 and
1913 the average increase in the re-'
tail prices of foods was about 60
per cent, according to statistics pub­
lished by the Department of Labor.
During the" same period wages in­
creased less than 30 per cent, accord­

ment of his claim. The insurance companies, it seems,
never will learn. Their desire for profits at the ex­
pense of injured workmen, will sooner or later bring
about their undoing. Their departure from Minnesota
now is but a matter of time.
And why should not the state insure its workers.
Such a plan would serve a double purpose. Injured
workingmen and dependents of deceased workingmen
would be paid just compensation and the state would
be more interested in enforcing safety regulations.
The state, by direct taxation, is now caring for
10,000 of its "crippled" population in its numerous in­
stitutions. It is costing the people $2,538,000 a year
to care for its insane, feeble minded, deaf, inebriates,
consumptives, blind, prison inmates and incorrigible,
indigent and crippled children. The state has invested
more than $15,000,000 in its charitable and corrective
institutions, yall of which are under the supervision of
the State Board of Control.
The same principle that war ants the state to cars
for its mental and physical unfortunates and for its
criminals, should prompt it to provide for a just and
economical system to care for the thousands of men
and women who are annually crippled while producing
the wealth of the state."

The report sums up the economic
causes of disease:
"No attempt to present the real
meaning of yie problem of health
among wage workers and their fam­
ilies can be complete without taking
into consideration their economic
status—the wages they earn and the

ily is able to receive—and comparing
it with those standards which have
been agreed upon as reasonable and
necessary for the maintenance of
health.
Less Than $10 a Week.
"Without taking into consideration
the loss of working time for any
cause, it has been found that during

LOOKS INTO STOKES
Wants to Know About Part He
Played In Financing Felix

HIS RECENT INTERVIEW
GIVEN TO SQUARE THINGS
Is Wall Street Using Stokes to
Help Restore Privilege
In MexicoS
By CHESTER M. WRIGHT.
NEW YORK, April 20.—When a
New York chorus girl peppered W.
E. D. Stokes, New York millionaire,
with pistol b'ullets some few years
ago that didn't mean that he was
ruined for limelight purposes. He
is in it again.
Stokes gave out an interview at
Lexington, Ky., a few days ago in
which he said that he was supporting
Felix Diaz, who is reported to have
landed in Mexico well supplied with
money and with a small band of
men.
Felix Diaz is the neohew of the old
Porfirio Diaz, once Mexico's dictator.
Felix Diaz is young dandy who has
long been obsessed with the notion
that he could some day conquer Mex­
ico and rule as his uncle once did. He
is having a fresh try at the job now.
He stands about as much chance of
succeeding as a submarine does of
flying, but that is beside the point.
Admits Financing.
The point is that an American has
admitted—granting always that he
has been quoted correctly—that he
financed this young plutocratic brig­
and. Diaz has the backing of a con­
siderable number of the old Mexican
scientifico crowd, including some of
the members of the reactionary Ma
dero family. It should be remem­
bered in connection with the Maderos
who are alive now that they are very
unlike the martyred Francisco Ma
dero. The present Maderos are scien
tificos, wealthy, shrewd, and always
hoping for the return of the old
order in Mexico.
So these Maderos, whose financial
headquarters are in Wall street, are
placing strong hope in the Diaz
movement. What financial connec­
tion Btokes has with matters Mexi­
can, aside,from his backing of Felix
Diaz, hasn't come out yet, but it is
probable that before long" it will de­
velop that there is a very good rea­
son for his desire to see the plump
young Felix in the saddle.
May Question Stokes.
The United States Department of
Justice is looking into Stokes' rela­
tionship with Diaz, and, it is said,
lias been looking into it for some
time. And the announcement that
the department had been watching
Stokes for some time before he gave
out his interview seems to indicate
that his interview was given out in
an effort to clear himself from suspi­
cion. He sets up the ridiculous claim
that he promised to aid Diaz only on
condition that Diaz remain friendly
to the United States. Perhaps a bet­
ter interpretation might be that Diaz
was promised support only on condi­
tion that he remained friendly to the
money powers of the United States.

Harrison Gray Otis and the Los An­

union movement and its members

eral is beginning to realize that these
campaigns are costly, when practiced
on other folks, since a jury has

500 damages in his suit for libel. This
is the third time Attorney Scott has
started a damage suit against Otis,
and in each instance, he has been suc­
cessful. The three awards total

occupations generally worked at

proximately one-fifth earned less
than $4 and nearly one-half earned
less than' $6 a week."
But the wotkers are not allowed
to earn even these amounts in every
week of the year. The report says:
VA conservative estimate, based on
all the available statistics of loss in
working time, would appear to be
that wage workers in the principal
manufacturing and mining industries
lose on the average from one-fifth to
one-third of the full working time

Low Standard Pedominates.
"Statistics of total incomes of wage
workers' families point to the con­
clusion that the average total annual
family income (including earnings of
women and children) in the principal
manufacturing and mining industries
has been between $700 and $800 in
recent years.' This average, however,
does not adequately depict the -real
situation for the conclusion is also,
indicted that one in every 10 or 12
workingmen's families had at the
time of the investigations .an annual
income of less than $300 a year that

these and other such conditions are
but incidents of poverty."
Low Wages Kill and Maim
Many pages could be filled with
some of the more striking illustra­
tions of how low wages kill and
maim. The report describes the bad
housing conditions due to meager In­
comes, and the neglect by the com­
munity of the drainage and sanita
tion of districts where the underpaid
workers live. It tells how the piece­
work system breaks down the health
of the workers in the shops, by caus­
ing strain and fatigue. It describes
the effect of irregular employment
and unemployment on the health of
the victims. The entire pamphlet
