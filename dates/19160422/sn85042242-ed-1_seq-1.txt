TRAIN GREW TO
ASSIST HOLD-UP
iRawlings, Wyo, April 21.—Union
Pacific passenger train No. 21 was
held up by a bandit west of Hanna,
Wyo., early1 tonight. After compel­
ling the guard on the train to take
up a collection from the passengers
in the observation car, the bandit
compelled the brakeman to collect
the valuables of passengers in one of
the two sleepers. As the train ap­
proached Edson, the 'bandit dropped
from the train and ran toward the
hills.
flie bandit, who is believed by rail­
road officials to be the man who re­
cently committed two similar hold­
ups, is thought to have boarded the
train at Greeley, Colo.
While engaging the guard in con­
versation, the bandit drew up two
guns. The passengers in the obser­
vation car were forced to drop their
valuables into a hat held by the
guard, who was then compelled to ac­
company the bandit through the first
sleeper, where, however, no passen­
gers were molested.
Reaching the last sleeping car, the
brakeman was pressed into service.
As the bandit leaped from the rapidly
running train, he rolled down the em­
bankment and after regaining his
feet, ran to the hills.

Minot Attorney Receives En­
dorsement of Democratic
State Committee.
Fargo, N. P., April 21.—North Da­
kota democrats today opened the I'.Uli
campaign by placing a complete tick­
et of candidates in the field for stale
ofliee.
The ticket was not endorsed, the
committee simply taking this means
of bringing candidates into (he field.
A new feature wa injected into the
gubernatorial situation, when ilalvor
L. Halvorson of .Minot was brought
forward as a candidate for governor,
as against D. 11. McArthur and I,. S.
Plat on of 'Fargo and Valley Cit y, re­
spectively.
•For congress it is expected that

dates in the First, Second and Third
districts, respectively.
For senator, John Bruke and F. O.
Hellstrom are in the field. Reports
that there would be an attempt to
endorse one or the other of these
candidates proved groundless, for
nothing was done. The balance of
the ticket as outlined today follows:
Lieutenant Governor—IWilliam Kitz
man, Willow City.
Secretary of State—William Olson,
Valley City.
Attorney General—G. S. Woolege,
Minot.

THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR, NO. 87 (NEWS OF THE WORLD) BISMARCK, NORTH DAKOTA, SATURDAY MORNING, APRIL 22, 1915. (BY ASSOCIATED PRESS)
DAILY TRAIN
President Hantiaford Writes the
Commercial Club of N. P.'a
Intentions.
TRAVELING PUBLIC
VOICE SATISFACTION
Enable People to- Make Trips on
North Line Quite Com­
fortably,
Daily passenger service heiween
Bismarck and Stanton and Kildeer,
to the northwest, and Bismarck and
Cannonball and Motl, to the south­
west, will be established by the Nor­
thern Pacific about May 15.
This welcome intelligence was con­
veyed to the Commercial lul» in a
letter from President J. M. llanna
ford, received yesterday. President.
JL'innaford says:
"Referring to the correspondence
that passed between us early in the
month (my letter of April 10), in the
matter of a daily service north and
south of Bismarck, on the Golden
Valley and ,Mott line.s
"1 told you in my letter that our
people were figuring on just what
was necessary and what, could be
done to improve this service. We
have decided, commencing probably
May 15, to operate a passenger serv­
ice on both these lines, putting our
freight service on a tri-weekly basis,
with extra freights whenever the
prompt handling of business demands
it. This is an experiment which de­
pends largely upon patronage for suc­
cess and for continuance.
"I cannot halp feeling that the rap­
id development along these lines will
warrant the service if it does not,
that our friends and patrons will will­
ingly join us in some other arrange­
ment, knowing that, we will give
them the very best we can afford."
Should Satisfy All.
The Commercial club feels that the
service proposed by I/resident iHanna
ford1 should satisfy Qverypne. The
principal- ob jeipt ltin #•*-the Vstablish
ment of daily passenger service in
the Alott and 'Kildeer branches was
I hat it would result in less frequent
freight service. President Hanna
ford, however, promises to operate
all the freight trains the traflic will
warrant, and it is almost certain that
this will mean daily service during
the summer, when the perishable
freight is the heaviest.
Means a Great Deal.
Daily fwssenger service between
Kildeer and Stanton and .Molt and
intervening points will mean a great
deal to the retail interests of Bis­
marck. There is no queslion that
much of the Irade from this terri­
tory which logically should come to
Bismarck has gone to catalogue
houses because or the expense and
time involved in a shopping trip to
the capital city. Under the new
regime, with trains so timed as lo ar­
rive in the cily during the day and
with Ihe number of hours which
must he spent enronte cut in half,
the volume of business which will
come lo Bismarck may be o\pccled
io be trebled.
To Celebrate Advent of New Service.
Tile Commercial rlub trade exten­
sion commit lee is planning lo cele­
brate the inauguration of this new
service with a booster special over
)ofh lines. The 'Northern Pacific has
agreed to waive all guarantees, and
the journey will be made at the reg­
ular fare. It is highly important that
Bismarck cultivate this rapidly de­
veloping district, and every business
man in the capital city can well af­
ford to take a day off May 15 and
call on his friends "up the line."
Rev. Leonard
Is Dead
New York, April 21.—The Rev.
Adna B. Beonard, secretary emeritus
of the Board of Foreign Missions of

79th year. Mr. Leonard was born in
Berlin township. Ohio, and was or­
dained in IS60. Before coming to

had been presiding elder in the Ohio
and Kansas conferences.

BERLIN'S REPLY

Along West Front in

RUSSIANS CONTINUE
THEIR OFFENSIVE
Defeat ol' British in Tigris Reg­
ion by Turkish Forces Is
Noted.
London, April 21.-Next week is set
by unollicial advices from Berlin as
the time when it is probable Ger­
many will make reply to the Ameri­
can note demanding discontinuance
of Cermany's present method of sub­
marine warfare on pain of severance
of diplomatic relations.
On all fronts around Verdun, the
Germans are bombarding French po­
sitions, especially those occupied by
the French in their last attack around
Leniort Homme, northwest of the
fortress, and in the sector from the
eastern bank of the Mouse to Fort
Vatix.
No Engagements.
i.\o infantry engagements have tak­
en place around Verdun, although
Paris records the occupation of a por­
tion of a crater made by a German
mine in the Argonne forests.
The Teutons in east Galicia near
Popovagor'a, went on the offensive
against the Russians, but Petrograd
asserts that their efforts were with­
out results. The bombardments by
the Germans of the Russians holding
Ikskul bridgehead is still in progress.
Farther south of this point, west ot
Olyka, and north of Ourivatza, the
Germans assayed an attempt against
Russian trenches, but were repulsed.
On the Austrian-Italian fronts there
has been the usual artillery duel and
at various points small infantry en­
gagements. l\'o change in positions
has taken place.
Continues Offensive.
•Petrograd reports that the Rus­
sians' Caucasus army continues ou
the, .offensive agailist. the Tv.j-ks in
Asia Minor. Constantinople, in ac­
knowledging the ocupation of Trebi
zond by the Russians, says the town
has been evacuated in anticipation of
its capture, the Turkish troops with­
drawing "in accordance with instruc­
tions, to a sector where they will
have a task to fulfill."
Another defeat of the British in
the Tigris region near Felahie is re­
corded by Constantinople. The Brit­
ish are declared to have been forced
lo abandon with heavy losses ad­
vance positions they had occupied,
and compelled to retreat westward.
Gaston Deschamps, writing in the
Temps, gives a vivid description of
his visit to the Verdun front, from
which he has just returned:
"The vast battlefield was veiled by
a sleety rain, but Verdun, Douaumont
and Leniort Homme were vaguely out­
lined in the distance. Verdun wound­
ed, but upright, s'ood like a sentinel
guarding the entrance lo the valley,
while the towers of their cathedral
rose like two oulstretched arms in
protest against the misery and desola­
tion about them. The citadel- still
stands unscathed."
Thirty Killed.
Bordeaux, France. April 21. —Thirty
persons are believed to have been kill­
ed in the explosion of a powder
branch of a grenade factory here to­
day. Twenty-eight ave already been
taken out of the debris. The cause
of the explosion has not been estab­
lished, but it is believed a spark set
off the powder while it was in the
process of being mixed.
IN THE SADDLE
Springfield, III., April 21.—One fee­
ble "No," on resolutions endorsing
President Wilson and the administra­
tion headed by Governor Dunne was
the only inharmonious word raised in
the democratic state convention here
today.
What fighting was done occurred
behind closed doors, in committee
meetings, but everything in the con­
vention was cumulative evidence of
the control of the democratic party
in Illinois by Roger Sullivan, former
democratic national committeeman.
The identity of the author of that
particular "No" remained undiscover­
ed.
Attorney General Patrick J. Lucey
of Streator was made permanen
chairman of the convention.
HAGGART FOR SENATOR.
Fargo, N. D., April 21.—G ilbert W.
Haggart, the well known contractor,
announced today that he will be a
candidate for the republican nomi­
nation to the state senate from the
Ninth 'Legislative district, which in­
cludes the city of Fargo, the village
of North Fargo and Fargo township.
Mr. Haggart is a pioneer of Fargo
and has a large circle of friends, who
will pull for his success at the polls.
He is a man of wide business ex­
perience and is well qualified for the
duties of the office.

Ambassador Gerard is known to
have entered into a brief conversation
with Foreign Minister von Jagow, af­
ter delivering the communication. Al­
though the contents of a second mes­
sage received late today was closely
guarded, it. is understood that the am­
bassador informed the department he
had been assured immediate consider­
ation would be given the note. It. be­
came known tonight that several
messages have been received from
Ambassador Gerard during the past
day or so. It was slated authorita­
tively, however, that tliey transmitted
only expressions of editorial opinions
from German newspapers. These edi
lorial excerpts were closely examined
by officials lo gain some understand­
ing of Ihe German opinion.
Bernstorff on Trip.
Count von IternstorlT, the German
ambassador, was not in Washington
today. He left, early this morning on
a week-end trip. He is not expected
to return to Ihe capital until Monday,
unless dispatches of an important na­
ture, bearing on the submarine issue,
should be received before then.
The German embassy is sending
many informative dispatches to Ber­
lin. The majority of those sent, so
far have contained interpretations of
public and official opinion and the am­
bassador's own views of the situation.
Berlin, via London, April 21.—Noth­
ing has as yet developed as the re­
sult of the American note to Ger­
many concerning Germany's subma­
rine warfare. iNo expression of opin­
ion is obtainable at the foreign of­
fice.
Neither the note nor any reference
to it has been published in Germany,
and there is no intimation hen the
note will be made public. The cele­
bration of Holy Week and Easter­
tide are proceeding without any
knowledge of foreign complications.
Orders to speed up, repair and over­
haul work on vessels of the Atlantic
fleet have been sent to the command­
ers of the various navy yards by Sec­
retary Daniels. In case of shortage
of laborers, the work is to be expedit­
ed by employment of the ships' per­
sonnel.
The move was explained as a "pre­
paredness test," the illustration of
which will demonstrate how soon the
vessels can be placed in readiness
after their strenuous winter maneu­
vers.

iNo
Change Reported.
Pending word from General Scott,
Secretary Daker reiterated his state­
ments that no change had 'been made
in orders to General Funston and that
the department had no knowledge ot
any change in the hitter's orders to
General Pershing. No official report
had been received, he Baid, that the
expedition was at a standstill.
The secretary admitted that offi­
cial dispatches had carried as a ru­
mor the report that Mexican officers
had warned General Pershing not to
proceed south of Parral. It was
learned at the state department that
a report to this effect was transmi
ed some days prior the Parral in­
cident through consular agents.
Made No Change.
Mr. Ilaker insisted that the warn­
ing had made no change in the or­
ders to the forces. It was indicated
tonight that a reply to Gen. Carran
za's telegram calling attention to th»
clash at Parral and asserting that.tbe
American commander had violated
his orders and the agreement, with the
de facto government in entering the
town would be dispatched mhmNI* War
department officials say tjie report
on the incident from General Peril­
ing, Major Tompkins and other offi­
cers is not complete, it has been
withheld from publication because of
the flat contradiction it contains of
the Mexico City advices from Gen.
Carranza as to the part his troops
played in the fighting.
Probe Parral Incident.
"With this report as a basis, the
Parral incident will be treated as a
matter entirely separate from the sug­
gestion of the de facto government
that the troops be withdrawn. While
immediate interest centers naturally
as to the troops in Mexico, there aro
renewed indications about the state
department today that a wholly dif­
ferent aspect of the Mexican prob­
lem was causing growing concern.
That is the movement supposedly
headed by Felix Diaz, nephew of the
former .Mexican dictator, for a new
revolution against the de facto gov­
ernment. None of the information
upon which the uneasiness rests has
been disclosed. The llaz movement,
it is said, has the backing of various
elements of Mexicans, both in Mexico
and in this country. As viewed by
the stale department, it is under­
stood the activities of these persons
are the more dangerous because they
are wealthy.
While no definite information was
obtainable tonight, there were indica­
tions that some Washington officials,
at least, thought it possible that the
Diaz interests were seeking to under­
mine Gen. Carranza among his com­
manders. Should clear indication of
this become apparent, Gen. Carran
za's attention would be called to the
situation.
Message From Sc«tt.
A brief inesage from General Scott
reporting his arrival at San Antonio
