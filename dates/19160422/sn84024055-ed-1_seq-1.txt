HEW TO THE LINE; LET THE CHIPS FALL, WHERE THEY MAY
Vol. XXI.
The Deneen-Thompson-Brundage Factions of the Republican
Party Are Still Bitterly Wrangling and Fighting Among
Themselves and Are Unable to Elect a Chairman for the
County Committee
CONGRESSMAN MARTIN B. MADDEN HAS UTTERLY FAILED SO FAR
TO UNTIE THE TIGHT POLITICAL KNOT.
ON THE OTHER HAND THE UNWASHED DEMOCRATS ARE ALL GET
TING TOGETHER FOR THE HON. ROGER C. SULLIVAN AND CON
GRESSMAN A. J. SABATH HUGGED EACH OTHER AROUND THE
NECK AT THE MEETING AT THE SHERMAN HOUSE LAST MONDAY.
JAMES M. DAILEY WAS SELECTED CHAIRMAN OF THE COUNTY COM
MITTEE, WM. D. FEENEY, SECRETARY; FRED W. BLOCKL TREAS
i URER.
HON. MACLAY HOYNE OWING TO THE NEW COMPACT BEWEEN THE
HARRISON AND THE SULLIVAN FACTIONS WILL BECOME THE
ORGANIZATION CANDIDATE FOR RE-NOMINATION AND RE-ELECTION
AS STATE'S ATTORNEY FOR COOK COUNTY.
EDWARD R. LITZINGER IS MORE THAN LIKELY TO BECOME THE DE
NEEN CANDIDATE FOR STATE'S ATTORNEY OF COOK COUNTY.
HON. EDWARD OSGOOD BROWN SHOULD RECEIVE THE UNANIMOUS
NOMINATION AT THE HANDS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY OF
COOK COUNTY FOR ONE OF THE JUDGES OF THE SUPERIOR
COURT.
At no time in the history of the
Republican party in this part of the
country have its leaders been so tightly
bound or tied together that no one
among them was unable to untie the
knot like unto the present time; even
Congressman Martin B. Madden, "with
all of his great ability and eminent
training along political lines has so fax
met with utter failure in his attempt
to untie the tight political knot, and
the Deneen-Thompson-Brundage fac
tions are still bitterly fighting and
wrangling among themselves over the
election of a chairman of the Cook
county Eepublican committee, and af
ter a week of cross-firing and double
dealing it is very hard to tell just
when the fighting "will come to an end.
There are many big political jobs at
stake this coming fall and they are all
worth fighting for and the only -way to
prevent Mayor Thompson and his City
Hall forces from capturing them all is
for the Deneen-Brundage faction to
form a combination, ' elect the new
chairman of the county committee and
beat Mayor Thompson to it.
Ti'o unwashed Democrats are greatly
delighted to see the Republicans fight

Hotel Sherman on Monday the Hon.
Rog.r C. Sullivan and Congressman A.
T. .ibath were just like two twin
brothers for they both sat in the front
row of the meeting so that it would

THE INIQUITOUS SHIELDS
WATERPOWER BILL.
To following lettor speaks for itself.
Milford Pike Co., Pa., April 10, 1916.
Mr. .lulius F. Taylor,
i-MUor, Broad Ax,
Chicago. HI.
lVar Mr. Taylor:
The iniquitous Shields biU, giving
away Pie waterpowers on our navi
gablp .streams, about which I wrote
yon on February 15, has been driven
through the Senate, but it has not
Passed the. House. There is still a
Bod c'umico not only to stop this raid
0n public property, but to pass a fair
anl honest waterpower bili in its
Place.
Everything I said about the Shields
y1" m my fetter to you was confirmed
ln the delicto. According to its own
nPPorters,.'this bill turns over to the
Per interests waterpower equivalent
to twice Vy mechanical power of every
i now t used in the United States,
r enough to meet the needs of two
feared million people. This it does
j? Perpetuity, although pretending to
""St the mint: fn fiffv rran-rn Rmftll
xuuer tc:
ere is pressure to get it
mrourii
n MiOfeh 21 a substitute for the
hold.
At the meeting at the Hotel Sher
man, the Hon. James M. Dailoy was
ejected chairman, of the county com
mittee; secretary, WiUiam JJ. Feeney;
financial secretary, Jacob Lindheimer;
treasurer, Fred. W. Blocki; eergeant-at-arms,
John Leonard, all Sullivan men,
the followers of former Mayor Carter
H. Harrison who were present simply
looked on in silence while the above
slate was rushed through the harmony
meeting.
The Hon. Maclay Hoyne, who has
always been one of the head supporters
of the Hon. Carter H. Harrison, "the
man of Destiny," is strongly slated to
become the organization or the Sulli
van and Harrison candidate for re
nomination and re-election as State's
Attorney of Cook county and already
Mr. Hoyne feels sure of his calling
and election.
Edward B. Litzinger who belongs to
the Charles S. Deneen wing of the Ee
publican party is more than likely to
be pushed to the front for the nomina
tion for State's Attorney of Cook coun
ty. It would be very pleasing indeed to
the thousands of friends of the Hon.
Edward Osgood Brown if the leaders
of the Democratic party in this city
and county would select him to make
the race for one of the Judges of the
Superior Court, for if he was thus hon
ored he would surely be elected, for as
one of the Judges of the Circuit Court
he always dealt out equal and exact
justice to his feUow men who would
be honoring themselves if they could
assist to re-elect him to the bench of
Cook county.
Shields bill was reported to the House
of Representatives. Unlike the Shields
bill, this House bill makes no perpe
tual grant of public waterpower, but
wisely and in fact sets a limit of fifty
years. Nevertheless, it is not yet a
good bill. For example, it gives away
the public waterpowers without com
pensation. There is no reason why the
waterpower corporations should not
pay for what they get. The rest of us
do. The House bill should bo amended
accordingly.
If the House corrects its own bill
and then passes it, the good bill from
the House and the bad bill from the
Senate will go to conference, and the
differences will be adjusted by the con
ferees. The managers of the water
power campaign believe that a major
ity of the conferees will be friendly
to them, and will report a bill in their
interest. They wiU then try to rush
the conference bill through, probably
in the confused and crowded final
hours of the session. Such a plan has
often served the special interests in
the past, and it is dangerous now.
During the debate on the Shields
bill, this course was openly advised.
There was under discussion an amend
ment giving preference to the appli-
CHICAGO,
cant for a public waterpower who
offers the best terms to the public.
One of the supporters of the Shields
bill, Senator Nelson of Minnesota, af
ter referring to the amendment as
"bad and vicious," went on to say:
"It is something that we can elimi
nate in conference. We might
let it go in and then dispose of it in
conference." (Congressional Record,
March 8, 1916, page 4285).
We can beat this plan only by let
ting the people understand the facts.
This the power interests have set out
to prevent by confusing the public
mind with interested statements and
personal attacks.
I am asking for your help once more
to get the House to pass a good bill,
and then to stand by it, no matter
what the conferees may do. If the
House stands firm, the people will win
this fight. But the House needs to
know that the people are behind it.
Let me call your attention again to
the Ferris bill, a good bill dealing with
waterpower on public -lands and Na
tional Forests, which has twice passed
the House. An undesirable substitute,
the, jifyera bill, now before the Senate,
gives the public waterpowers away in
perpetuity. Under it, the power in
terests could occupy and exploit the
Grand Canyon itself, the greatest nat
ural wonder on this continent.
The waterpower interests want
everything or nothing. In the last
eight years they have killed eight
waterpower development bills that
were fair both to the corporations and
to the public. What the people need
is waterpower development on equit
able terms without further delay. They
can have what they want by letting
the House know it.
Sincerely yours,
Gifford Pinch ot.

STATE COMMITTEE AWAY
FROM HON. CHARLES S. DE
NEEN AND HIS FOLLOWERS.
His Hon. "Big BiU" Thompson is
more than likely to become the Illi
nois Member of the Republican Na
tional Committee.
Friday was a great day for the lead
ers of the G. O. P. at the state con
vention at Peoria, and it seems that
the followers of the Hon. Charles S.
Deneen were completely routed by
Mayor William Hale Thompson and
his forces for Fred E. Sterling was
chosen chairman of the state commit
tee who belongs to the Thompson Low
den, Sherman-Bundage wing of the
Eepublican party Congressman Wil
liam B. McKinley was elected chair
man of the convention and as there is
a great new deal on foot among the
leaders of the Eepublican party in this
state, tfio chances at present are two
to one that Mayor William Hale
Thompson will be the Illinois member
of the Eepublican national committee.

FETES NEGROES; HOME IS
"EGGED."
Memphis, April 21. Memphis so
ciety was in an uproar today follow
ing recent events when Y. M. C. A.

James H. Rees, onetof the social lead
ers of the city, because she was ten
dering a complimentary ball to two
Negro servants. Mrs. Rees is the wife
of Captain James H. Rees, prominent
