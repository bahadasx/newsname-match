Sentiment in Germany Is
Against Retracting From
Fixed Submarine Policy
Little Hope That Teutons Will Oo Length Demanded by
the United States, Despite Fact That Universal De
sire Is to Keep on Good Terms With Americans.
NOTE WILL BE FORWARDED NEXT WEEK

2:21 a. in., Nothing
of the receipt of the American note to (lermany concern
ing Germany's submarine warfare. Xo expression !
opinion is obtainable from the foreign office, where ab
solute reticence is maintained.
Xcither the note nor any reference to it has been pub
lished in Cicrmanv and there is no intimation as yet when
the note will be made public. The celebrations or Holy
week and of the Eastertide, therefore, are proceeding un
disturbed by any knowledge of foreign complications.
The ministers and other officials who were entitled to
it. received-a copy of the note this morning and were
engaged during the day in studying the document.
As far as the Associated Press has been made ac
quainted with the sentiment
be wrong to regard the situation as anything hut ex
tremelv grave. The note probably will be answered some
time next week after serious consideration has been
given the American contention, but there is little hope
that any answer can go to the length demanded by. the
Washington government, despite the fact that the gov
ernment desires to maintain good relations with the
United States.
The sentiment is against
Germany's submarine campaign, to say nothing of aban
doninff it.
WASHINGTON, April 21. Ambas
sador Gerard ut Berlin .allied the
stale department today that he had
delivered the Ameriean note on sub
marine warfare to the Herman for

apartment that he had been assured
Immediate consideration would be
given to the note.
ltiivlvc MessnBe.
It became known tonight that sev
eral messages have been received from
Ambassador Gerard during the past
duy or so. It was stilted authoritative
ly, however, that they transmitted
only expressions of editorial opinion
froin Uermun newspapers. These
editorial excerpts were closely ex
amined by officials In an attempt to
gnin some understanding' of the state
of German public opinion.
Dispatches from the ambassador are
looked for momentarily to Rive def
inite Information renardlntr the views
of German officials, the manner In
which the note was received and fore
casts of the action which will be tak
en by the German government In re
sponse to the demand of the United
States that It declares and effects an
fhandonment of the present methods
of conductlm submurino warfare.
Count von Ilernstorff, the German
ambassador, was not In WashlnRton
today. He left curly this morning on
a week-end trip. He is not expected
to return to tho capltol until Monday
unless dispatches of an Important na
ture beurltiK on the submarine Issue
should be received before then.

The German embassy is Bending In
formation dispatches to Herlln. The
majority so fur have contained inter

Count von liernstorff has strongly rec
ommended to his government that It

FRENCH SAY NOTE A
GRAVE INDICTMENT
PARIS, April 21. The comment of
the French press on President Wll
Von's address to congress may be
summed up In these words, which the
Petit Parislen prints In large type as
a heading over tho text of the speech:
'Never have tho head of a state
pronounced such grave words against
a stale with which It was not at war."
The president's address hag made a

newsnauers irlve It the place of honor.

The speech Is not merely a formal

BIG FIGHT COMING
ON GYPSY LEASES
Department Almost Sure to
Oppose Approval of
(Jypsy Osage Leases.
OSAGES DISSATISFIED
Do Xot Believe Big Leases
Brought Anything Like,
Their Real Value.
DECLARING thut he was still of
tho opinion that the depart
ment would not approve tho Gypsy
Oil company's leases, owing to the
fact that there was no bid on one of
the tracts and Oio bids on the other
two were pitifully small, J. George
Wright left I'awhuska yesterday aft
ernoon for Washington, taking with
him the bids made by the various
operators at tho famous auction sale
held Thursday.
While .Mr. Wright slated he was not
qualified to speak uuthoritutively for
the department, his own personal
opinion was to the effect that the
Gypsv oil company's stand to the ef
fect that In the ubsence of a bid tho
leases would remain In the possession
of tho present lessees would not he
sustained by the secretary of the In
terior. Mr. Wright pointed out that In the
advertisement covering the bidding,
the secretary reerved tho right to re
ject anv or all bids and based his con
clusion on that clause in the adver
t'semcnt. Fight Is Brewing.
There is no question but tho Gypsy
Oil company will make a determined
effort to force Secretary Ine to ap
prove Its leases In case he refuses to
do so. And ut this time it appears
us though the the matter will have to
bo decided In the courts If Secretary
Line does make such refund I and the
matter cannot be ctmnrlscd In any
other manner.

advantage of ugitutlng the long stand

confident thut the situation can be
smoothed out satisfactorily to all in

this time attracted much interest in
the capital, but it wus pointed out
that her representations could scarce

so, because the bill u I ready lias

Guaranty Fund.
.Special to The World.
OKLAHOMA CITY. April 21.
Preparation is being made by the attorney-general's
office to bring suit
against the banks which formerly
were state bunks, but nationalized to
escape obligations of the bank guar
anty fund. There are something like
two hundred of these banks which
owe a portion of the assessment that
hud been placed against them before
they nationalized. A decision of the
supreme court held that such unpaid
portion of the assessment was a
debt against the bunk, and that re
covery of it could be made by the
state by bringing snilt uguinst the
bunk. Nearly JtiOO.000 is Involved,
which when collected will be placed
in the guaranty fund, and will almost
put that fund on a cash basis, as
there are now little more than t"00,

affected by the demands of tho
brotherhoods of railway employes for
higher wages and an eight-hour day,
met here today to make preliminary
arrangements for the coming nego

A committee consisting of the sec

sides.
The demands of the employes wer
presented to the railroads individually
on April 1, with the request that the
roads Join in settling the questions st
