OMAHA, Apr. 22. Late returns
from the Nebraska preferential prt
mary are increasing the lend given
earlier to five opponents of William
Jennings Hryan in the race for dele
gates-at-large to the Democratic na
tional convention. Bryan is now in
sixth place on a ticket of seven, only
four of whom will be elected.
C. W. Bryan, brother of the forniei
sercetary of state, mayor of Lincoln,
has been beaten for the gubernatorial
nomination on the Democratic ticket,
according to returns from more than
two-thirds of the precincts of the state.
The nominee will be Keith Neville
of North Platte, who is now leading
Bryan by 10,000 vo'es. BryatCs cam
paign wan conducted on a prohibition
pratform and the former secretary of
state appealed personally to the voters
In his brother's behalf.
Senator G. M. Hitchcock, candidate
for the Demrocratic nomination for
United StBtes senator, has been nom
inated by a majority of two to one
over I. J. Dunn of Omaha. W. J.
Bryan tourned the state in opposition
to Senator Hitchcock.
The Republican race for nomination
for governor, which earlier returns in
dicated would be closely contested, is
now going to A. L. Sutton, who leads
8. fl. McKelvie, his nearest competi
tor by 2,000 votes. Henry Ford of De
troit has a substantial majority over
all other Republican candidates for
the presidential nomination. Suppor
ters of Albert B. Cummins, of Iowa,
who is nearly 3000 voles behind Ford
believe the Iowan may ultimately win.

Ford's lead appreciably to the advan

For national committeeman, R. B.

and James C. Dahlman are running so
closely for the Democratic nomination
which Is likely to be in doubt until
all the votes have been counted.
The result of the contest for dele

SUSTAINS INJURIES
John Andrews, the aged French ex
pressman, who stands in front of the
post office, was badly injured this
morning by his horse running away
and throwing him beneath the wheels.
The injured man was taken to the
county hospital, where he was placed
in a private ward. Examination dis
closed that the Injuries were a dislo
cated shoulder a broken arm and a
bad cut in the head which may prove
serloius owing to the advanced age of
the patient who has passed the 801 n
milestone.
Andrews usually drives a couple of
horses In double harness and never
has had any trouble except in cases
where either wus driven single, i nat
happened this morning when, with a
single horse, Andrews was driving
down Mineral street toward the rail
road station. The animal became
frightened at some flying object and
with a Jerk started to run. The sud
den shock threw the driver Into the
roadway where he was struck by the
front wheel and It is supposed, kick
ed by the animal. Two men who saw
the accident sprang into the wagon
and seizing the reins tried to check
the runaway but could not bring the
horse to a stop until they succeeded In
driving it into the fence at Clenden
ning's corral. Mr. Andrews Is one
of the best characters around town.
He has lived a frugal life and Is ere
dlted with having amassed a small
fortune. -

EXTERMINATING
RABID COYOTES
SMALL ARMY OF HUNTERS TAKE
THE FIELD UNDER RABIES
COMMISSION
Illy Aaaitrlntril lreaa. I
WASHINGTON. D. C, Apr. 22.
The appropriation by congress in the
urgent deficlncy act of $75,000 for the
control of rabiea among coyotes in the
west has enabled the bureau of bio
logical survey of the U. S. department
of agriculture, to put 5 inspectors and
190 hunters in the field, in addition
to its existing organization. These
men are to serve in Oregon, Nevada,
California! and Idaho, and along the
border in Utah. In addition to these
measures the Nevada Rabies commis
sion has signified its intention of ex
pending a large sum of money under
recommendations made by the biologi
cal survey, and It is probable that I
other states will do likewise. Stock
men and ranch owners are co-operating
by furnishing horses and forage
free of charge. The importance of
preventing the spread of the disease
is fully realized.
The coyote has always been a pest
to stockmen, but with the advent of
rabies it has become a serious dan
ger to persons as well as to stock.
In many sections of Oregon, Idaho,
California and Nevada, parents are
afraid to Bend their children to school
unless they are well guarded, and
there is always danger ttiat domestic
dogs will be bitten by the mad ani
mals and spreads the disease to the
families of their owners. In Oregon
and Nevada over 100 persons have
received the Pasteur treatment for
rabies within the past three years and
stock interests have suffered severely.
In one feed lot In Wlnnemucca, Neva
da, a single coyote caused the loss of
23 head of three-year old beef steers.
Although this Is regarded as the
most serious, it is not the first out
break of rabies among coyotes in the
western states. In 1911 the disease
made its appearance in Wallowa
county. Oregon, and spread southward.
This infestation still continues. In
the spring of 1915 the disease made it
first appearance In northern Nevada,
and at the present time southwestern
Idaho, northwestern Californiai, and
approximately the northern half of
Nevada are Infested.
The normal coyote Is cunning, but
cowardly and has a particular aver
sion to the scent of a human being.
When stricken with rabies, howevr.
it does not hesitate to snap at every
thing In reach and to attack men as
well as dogs and cattle. In this con
dition it does not eat and consequent
ly can not be killed by poisoned baits.
In controlling the disease the bur
eau of biological survey purposes first
to prevent Its spread hy killing off
the coyotes along the borders of the
infested districts
After this has ben

ENGLAND TO BUILD
HIGH TARIFF WALL
FREE TRADE EMPIRE BECOMES
AN ADVOCATE OF PROTEC
TION 8Y8TEM
i By Aaaovlnlrd t'reaa.)
LONDON, Apr. 22. The recent
tariff agitation, growing out of the
movement to cut off Germany's trade
activities after the war has been
checked by the announcement ot
Prime Minister Asquitu in Parliament
that the conferences of the allies go
ing on at Paris would not deal with
customs affairs, these being left for
governmental action by each country.
It has been expected that the confer
ences would take advisory action, in
line with the recent movement of Brl- -tish
chambers of commerce, for a
tariff giving special advantages to
trade among the allies and colonies,
reasonable concessions to neutrals,
and a Bolid wall against Germany.
But the premier's announcement la
taken to mean that while joint action
against Germany is open to discus
sion, each country must be left free
to frame its own tariff laws without
any commitment on a tariff scheme
at a conference. The Londong Morn
ing Post, one of the most active in the
recent agitation, urges that the prima
minister's announcement arraigns the
political against the business Inter
ests, and that the latter should press
forward their movement.
It says: "With a tariff wall round
the British empire we shall be In a
fit position to come to terms with our
friends and to defend ourselves
against our enemies. These questione
are urgent and burning; they have
been raised in a practical and pressing
form by the exigencies ot war. We
believe it to be true that we must
settle them or periBh. There la every
sign that the country now desires pro
tection. No free trader dare stand
up and say, In the face ot the lessons
of this war, that our present system
of free Imports shall be continued.
They all make concessions to opinion,
and many of our best free trade busi
ness men have been ashamed to an
nounce their change ot mind. It la
the free trade politician who remains
stubborn and unconverted. We are
certain that the producers should be
able to place before that able but
somewhat elusive politician convinc
ing proofs of the justice and the power
of their cause. There is not time to
be lost; it our industries do not dig
themselves in now they may be over
whelmed by the new dangers of
peace."
There Is some advantage even to
war. The Importation of limburger
cheese has practically stopped.
