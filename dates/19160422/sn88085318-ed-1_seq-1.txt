OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
TALKS ON BANKING.
(By courtesy of the American Bank
ers Association, Savings Hank Pept.)
YOU AND YOUR BANK
ACCOUNT.
When the banker accepts your
account, and gives you a pass
book and a check book, he has
the rijjht to expect certain things
from you as you have the right,
Legally and morally, to expect cer
tain things from him.
In the first place, he has the
right to expect a profit from your
account. Banking is an expen
sive business. It costs a certain
amount to. handle every check
that passes through the bank,
and every account should contrib
ute a portion to the expenses of
the bank, however small. When
your banker asks you to keep a
certain balance, he is merely ask
ing his right to a profit from your
account. It is easily to be seen
that if you keep a small balance,
say ten dollars, and the banker
furnishes you with stationery,
does the necessary bookkeeping
on the account (for your benefit
as well as his), the earning power
of that ten dollars, even if it were
invested at (I per cent, would be
insufficient to compensate him for
I lie cost attending that account.
Therefore be generous and give
him a chance to make a profit;
for as every sale of merchandise
should show a profit, so every bank
account should at least pay its
way. Give him as large a balance
as you can possibly keep—it will
help you very much in his esti
mation, help your credit, and add
to your self respect.
Second. Never overdraw. In
national banks overdrafts are now
forbidden, but whether they were
or not, you have no right to ask
it. It hurts your credit with the
banker. It is a forced loan with
out security, and is a poor busi
ness practice.
Sometimes an overdraft is al
lowed as a matter of accommoda
tion, and sometimes in order that
the credit of the drawer with the
holder of the check may not be
impaired; but it is bad practice,
gets you in wrong all over and
should neither be asked nor ex
pected.
Third. Do not draw against
"uncollected funds." By uncol
lected funds is meant checks Ihat
have not been collected. For in
stance, if you have a balance of
$100, and deposit a hundred dol
lar check and draw your own
cheek for $150, you have taken all
the original deposit and half of
the amount represented by the
check just deposited. The bank
er must send that check, let us
say to New York, and wait for
advice that it is paid before know
ing that it has been paid, which
may take three or four days. You
are asking him to pay out his
money three days in advance of
its receipt, a practice which good
banks frown upon and will not
allow. Lastly, draw your checks
properly, as outlined in the next
talk, and have your pass book
balanced once a month. Doing
these things consistently, your
banker will be a good friend and
you will be a good customer, in
favor with one who can do you
many favors.
Congressman C. C. Dill, unlike
tin: other congressmen from this
state for years past, lias taken the
trguble to prepare and introduce
a bill into congress for the reliei
of homesteaders. In Stevens
county there are many home
steaders who have taken up land
where it is impossible to do the
requisite amount of staffing in
the lime prescribed by the easy
ehair legislators at the national
capital. Yet Stevens county de
lire* to retain these homesteaders.
and to have the lands cleared as
fast as human energy will permit.
And for the benefit of this county,
Mr Dill has entered this bill,
\\ liirh reads ;is followi :
11. R. 11642, by Mr. Dill— To
amend Sees. 2291-207 revised
statutes relating to hoi.i"steads i
Thai the entrymati shall, in
order to comply with the require
ments of cultivation herein pro
vided for, cultivate not less than
one-sixteenth of the area of his
entry, beginning with the second
year of the e,ntry, and not less
than one-eighth beginning with
the third year of the entry, and
until final proof, except that in
case iif entries under section six
of the enlarged-homestead law
double the area of cultivation
herein provided shall be required;
thai the entryman in lieu of cul
tivation required herein may
make improvements upon his en
try by constructing fences or
buildings, by slashing, clearing,
or in other ways preparing the
land for cultivation for meadow.
for pasture, or for grazing pur
poses, or by planting orchard, or
by otherwise making the home
stead habitable or capable of pro
duction, or of enabling the entry
man to obtain means of livelihood
from the homestead, said improve
ments to aggregate in value and
amount each year of not less than
$1.50 per acre except that in cases
of entries under section six of the
enlarged-homestead law the
amount of improvements shall not
be less in value than 75 cents per
acre: Provided, That the term
"cultivation" shall be held to in
clude also the growing of grasses
oi 1 oilier crops for pasturage pur
poses or for making hay: Provided
further, That the above provision
as to cultivation shall not apply
to entries under the act of April
2-\ 1004. commonly known as the
Kinkaid Act. or entries under the
act iif June 17. 1902, commonly
known as the reclamation act, and
thai the provisions of this section
relative to the homestead period
shall apply to all unperfected en
tries (is well as entries hereafter
made upon which residence is re
quired.
Lust ypar Mr. Dill made an
arduous trip into the homestead
country oast and northeast of Col
ville accompanied by several
farmers and homesteaders who
knew the country, lie there ex
amined ai Srsi hand the condi
tions under which ous home
steaders have !><■<*ll forced to work,
and look with him to Washington
the direct knowledge of our con
ditions. At that time, it was
noted in these columns that Mr.
Dill was the first congressional
possibility who had taken the
pain* to find oul FOR HIMSELF
the real conditions, and he was
commended for his determination
to know what he was talking
about His present bill in con
gress shows the result.
Tt hfis long been known that the
department was opposed to cut
ting down the improvement re
quirements of homesteaders, but
on the contrary, the college-boy
autocrats in the interior depart
ment were anxious to keep the
homesteaders from being settled,
in order that the policy of conser
vation might be heightened to
the extent that all possible lands
be kept in the name of the gov
ernment. We hesitate to predict
that Mr. Dill will be able to get
his bill passed without a whole
lot of hard work, but if he keeps
after it like he did the reservation
matter, he will either get his bill
passed or there will be another
young revolution in that interior
department.
The bill me;ms so much to Ste
vens county that every assistance"*
should be accorded the congress
man who took the trouble to get,
the facts and write the bill.

A. J. Wilson, of Spokane, a
leading candidate for the republi
can nomination for congressman
two years ago, is an announced
candidate for the republican
nomination (his year, and has is
sued his platform stating his posi
tion. .Mr. Wilson is well known
in Stevens county, and is prob
nlily the strongest man the stand
pat republicans have in this dis
trict. He believes in protective
tariff, a tariff commission np
pointed by the friends of protec
tion, legislation by business men
Instead of politicians, and full
preparedness. His 30 years of ac
tive business experience are cited
as a part of his qualifications, and
inasmuch as a part of this 30 years
has been in connection with his
Stevens county interests, it is
probable that he will again receive
a heavy rapport from republicans
of this county.
According to the state board
if health, Washington lias the
lowest deatli rate of any state in
the union. It was so low in lUI4
thai the federal census bureau re
fused to publish it. They assert
that the population is over es
timated. Well, the census bu
reau did the estimating and, so
far as we have been able to learn-,
did not ask any advice from the
people of Washington as to how
highi or how low the estimate
'lould be. But if they cut our
■sti mated population to the low
est possible figure we would still
show the lowest death rate of any
tut" in the union. In fact, if our
population were left where it was
; n 1!M0 we would be right along
with the lowest. We have a low
death rate, just how low we can
not say until a census is taken,
but it is certainly as low, and
probably lower than that of any
other state.
A movement has been started
to reopen the beet, sugar factory
;it Waverly, this slate, and prelim
inary investigations show that, the
main difficulty to be overcome is
securing the necessary acreage.
Capitalists have agreed to furnish
the money, providing contracts
can lie obtained for growing 6,000
acres of beets a year for five years.
Outside of acreage and capital,
low freight rates arc the only
other vital element to be consid
ered, and those interested have
been assured that rates can be se
cured that, will permit beets to be
brought to Waverly within a rail
distance of 200 miles. This means
that not only can the Spokane
valley raise beets for a factory at
Waverly, but that the Colville
valley can make a good profit on
them. Judging by past condi
tions there will also be many I'a-
Iniisc farmers who will grow from
live to twenty acres.
To raise an acre of sugar beets,
including payment for all team
and hand work, costs approxim
ately $30, At $G a ton, five tons
of beets will return the outlay.
The former figures of the Wav
erly factory show that the gen
eral average yield in that district
wiis from seven to eight tons an
acre, while the best farmers aver
aged over ten tons an acre. Un
der irrigation more dependent
crops can be secured and a great
er tonnage.
If there are farmers who would
be interested in growing beets,
providing a market is secured, the
Spokane Chandler of Commerce
desires to get in touch with them
.o that arrangements may be
made to reopen the Waverly fac
tory.

tin postoffice was hard at work
when a gentle tap wu heard at
the door and in stepped a blush
ing maiden of L 6 with a money
order which she desired cashed.
She handed it with a bashful
smilt! to the clerk who, after ex
nmining it. gave her tho money
it called for. At tho same time
he asked her if she hud read what
was written on the margin of the
order.
"No, I have not," she replied,
"for I can not make it out. Will
you pleUfl read it to me?'
'I tend you sjvi and a dozen
kinnei, "
Glancing at the bashful pirl, he
said, "Now 1 have paid you the
money and I suppose you want
the kisses?"
1' Yes,'' she said, "if he has sent
me any kisses I want them too."
It is hardly neotaiary to say
thai the balance of the order was
promptly paid in a seicntific man
ner.
On reaching home the delighted
maiden remarked to her mother:
"Mother, this postoflioe system of
ours is a great tiling, developing
more and more every year, and
•aeh new feature seems to be the
best. Jimmy sent me a dozen
kisses along with the money or
der, and the postoffice clerk gave
me twenty. Tt beats th" special
delivery all hollow."
