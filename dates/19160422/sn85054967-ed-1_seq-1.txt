Troops Chasing Villa Are
Expecting to Be Recai!ed
Expedition Simply Marking Time Until Definite Decision
IB Reached in Washington.
WILL ATTEMPT TO AVOID BLOODSHED TI I ERE
EL PASO, Tex., Aprii 20.
That the American troops in
Mexico will mark time for the
next 10 days was the view ex
pressed by Mexican officials in
Juarez today.
At the end of that time théy
believe the withdrawal of the
United States expedition will be
ordered by the Washington Gov
ernment.
Fear that longer delay by the
Amerian authorities in reaching
a decision will result in increas
ed antagonism on the part of
Mexican citizens was openly ex
pressed at General Gavira's
headquarters, but it was stated
there that every precaution was
being taken by the Carranza
troops to prevent further blood
shed such as occurred at Parrai.
Demand to Be Pressed
It has become plain that the
defacto government's demand
will be pressed. Furthermore,
General Alvaro Obregon has ON
dered the requisition for mili
tary purposes of the Mexican

McGannon
Gets a Run
on B. R. & P.
Michael McGannon, who has
controlied the destinies of the
Indiana-Punxsutawney passeng-1
er train for so many years that ;
he has come to be regarded al
most as part of tlie train itself,
has received a substantial and
much merited promotion. Start
ing tonight he will have a
through run on one of the nighi
"flyers" on the main line of the
8., R. and P. railroad, a position
wich carries with it additional
prestige as well as an increase of
wage.
Mr. McGannon has been in
the employ of the 8., R. and P.
railroad for more than 30 years
* and in point of service, is one of
the oldest employes on the road.
During his long service as con
ductor on the Indiana train Mr.
McGannon has become known to
practically every person who us
es the branch for travel and he
is going to be sorely missed by
the "regulars." Efficient and
obliging, Mr. McGannon is one
of the company's foremost ad
vocates of the slogan that has
made the 8., R. and P. one of
the foremost passenger carry
ing railways of the East
"Safety and Service."
Mr. McGannon will be suc
ceeded on the branch by James
Moore, who has been the con
ductor on the Iselin-Creekside
branch for the past 12 years.
Mr. Moore will probably movo
his family to Punxsutawney and
they will be gladly welcomed
here.
The promotion for Mr. Mc-
Gannon will necessitate his mov
ing to either Rochester or Buf
falo.—Punxsutawney Spirit.

THE PA TRIOT
Northwestern railway between
Chihuahua City and madera.
This will prevent the delivery
to the American troops of 10
carloads of hay, which are ur
gently needed by the horses and
mules of General Pershing's ex
pedition. This fodder had been
consigned to merchants friendly
x to the Americans, but commer
cial traffic is now held up com
pletely.
Man-Hunt Forgotten
One American supply base is
at San Antonio, on the Mexico
Northwestern line betweer Mad
era and Chihuahua.
The hunt for Francisco Villa
has been momentarily forgotten,
owing to the recent develop
ments of international impor
tance. Prominent Mexic? ns in
E 1 Paso openly express the be
lief that the Obregon faclion in
the Mexican government will
soon force General Carranza to
declare war against the United
States. Carranza is*decla:'ed to
have lost ali dominance in the
de facto government.
