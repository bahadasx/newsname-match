WASHINGTON. April 22. "If th

will be a triumph for diplomacy. It
will not be stch a war as with Spain,
tut wholesale and ruthless."
This passage from a letter by Admi
ral Fiske, brought from the navy de
partment files, was placed before the
senate today. Daniels suppressed It,
but a senate resolution demanded its
publication. Daniels said that when
Fiske wrote the letter he did not con
sider It sufficiently important to de
liver It personally to the secretary
and merely filed it. The report from
the general navy- board, which the
resolution also requested, was refused
on the advice of Admiral Dewey. Ha
said it was incompatible with the pub

report dealt with international af
