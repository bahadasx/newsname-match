GRIFFIN'S TAKE
QUAKER AGENCY
Tho history of nutomobllo tiro
making hns been marked with mnny
refinements nnd improvements but
practically all effort was In tho di
rection of Increased mileage until
tho discovery by tho Quaker City
Rubber Co., of Philadelphia, of a bc
cict and oxcIubIvo method of torn
porliiR tho rubber, a trentment that
not only adds strength and endur
ance, but also increases tho shock
absorbing properties of rubber with
consequent comfort to passcngors
and savings In car upkeep cost thru
the absorption of vibration.
Tempered rubber is unusually ad
hesive, n factor of great value in
preventing ply separation nnd In ere
ntlngnn inseparable bond between
tho trend and tho carcass. Temper
ing prevent tho tread picking out
or chipping and Insurou uniformity
of wear on tho surfaco of tho tread.
Tho Quaker City Rubber Co., states
that Quaker tires aro us finely tem
pered as a watchsprlng, thereby se
curing tho proper degrees of hard
ness, toughness, elasticity, resiliency
and cuduranco.
J P. Grlflln of Logan, and IJ. 13.
Grlflln of Richmond, report n brisk
demand for Quaker tires, nnd stato
thnt users enthusiastically endorse
them becaitBO of their wonderful
mllcago nnd easy riding qualities.
Despite tho high cost of rubber
and fabric, Quaker tires havo not
been reduced In qunllty, tho samo
weight and high grndo Sea Island,
duck, tho identical number of plies,
and tho Bamo amount of the finest
rubber are used as was tho enso bo
foro war conditions sent tho prices
of theso commodities skyward.
