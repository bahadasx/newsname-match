Washington. D C, April 23. A pre

t-'o't, chief of staff of the array, on
ins conference with Gen. Funston at
.san Antonio, Texas, Friday night, re-K-irding
the Mexican problem, was

Meanwhile, movements of Felix Diaz,
m phew of the former dictator, for a
1,. w revolution against the de facto
ifi ernment are causing considerable
uncaslnehs at the slate department.
None of the Information upon which
the uneasiness rests has been disclosed.
1 1 Is known, however, that several Max

closely watched and it seems possible
ihat some of the anti-American feeling
m Chihuahua state which has met tho
troops pursuing Villa, may be attrib

The Dlax movement. It is said, has
the hacking of various elements of Mex

As viewed by the state deaprtment. It
is understood the activities of theso
persons are the more dangerous be
cause they are wealth, while the de
facto government ia involved in a snarl
of financial complications which would
ie hard to overcome, even In times of
complete peace.

While no definite information is ob

some Washington officials at least,
think It possible that the Diaz Inter

Since no new revolution could be

Following the verdict of "guilty" in
the Roberson case, which verdict car
ried a sentence of 20 ears in the peni
tentiary, a new trial was granted by
judge Dan M. Jackson when affidavits
were presented by Roberson's attorneys
to the court stating that Sidney Burch,
who was convicted in 1900 of theft in
Indian Territory, and sentenced to the
Leavenworth federal prison, and A. J.
Martin, a juror in the Roberson case,
were the same person. Roberson then
gave bond and was released from the

Ei HER CASE
PERJURY- CHE
Saturday night set aside the ver
dict of the jury finding Roberson
guilty of the murder of II. F. Boy
kin, at Sierra Blanca on January
16, and granted the motion for a
new. trial. '
Arguments began at 5:30 Satur
day afternoon The affidavit
signed by Martin, was Introduced
by Roberson's attorneys to show
that he was not a proper juror
and the court took that view of
the matter. Martin's affidavit
stated that, under the name of
Burch, he had been convicted In
Indian territory
Failed to Find Martin.
As soon as he learned of the af
fidavit district attorney W. W.
Brldgers had a subpoena instanter
issued for Martin, but the officers
failed to find htm and It was
thought he had gone to Juarez.
Martin had been for some time
employed as a waiter in a restau
rant. W. W. Brldgers filed a counter
affidavit claiming that he had tel
egraphed to the warden of the
Leavenworth federal prison asking
for the record of Sidney Buret.
The warden replied that Burch bad
served a shrt term and was re
leased on habeas corpus. District
attorney Brldgers claims the fed
eral court was without Jurisdic
tion. Brldgers declares that Sid
ney Burch. and A. J. Martin are
not the sauxie person.
Photographs Different.
The Bertllllon photograph, with the
measurements and description on the
back, of Sidney Burch, has been ob
tained by police chief Johnson from
Leavenworth prison. It states that
Sidney Burch waa seat te that prison
from Parla Texas, oa & charge of hog
stealing tn'lBMa territory. The rec
ord shews that Barch was 29 years old
on April 1. lOea, which would make
him 45 years old at the present time.
Martin states that he is but 31 years
old and looks even younger, as he is
smooth shaven and boyish in appear
ance. The Bertillion picture of the
man recorded at the prison as Sidney
isurcn snows a man oi mature years,
with a mustache and with a sharp
nose. Martin has no mustache. Ms
nose is neither long nor sharp and the
picture of the man convicted as Sidney
Burch does not compare in any way
with Martin, who, according to the
affidavit filed with the district court
claimed he was the same person as
Sidney Bureli The ' description also
gives the color of SidJiey Burch's hair
as chestnut while Martin's is decidedly
blonde, giving him his nickname of
"Blondy."
Martin's Statement.
In a sworn and signed statement Fri
day night, made In the presence of
chief Johnson, other officers and wit
nesses, Martin told of his part In the
case. He said he voted "guilty" every
time, as he said he thought Roberson
ought to hae been convicted. He told
of going to a bar near where he worked
as a waiter in a restaurant and of be
ing introduced to some persons, one
of whom had but one arm and another,
whom he understood, to be a young
lawjer -'Every time I went Into this bar
I met some of these men." he said in
his statement "They bought me many
drinks Finally they asked me to lay
off and I agreed. The lawver asked
me if I would make an affidavit of
what went on in the Jury room. I
waB drinking right alone; then. I laid
off again and the proprietor of the
bar handed me a $." bill and said I
was to buy drinks with it I was about
half drunk all the time
Goes to An Office.
"With some of the others we went
to an office in the First National bank
building, where we met a detective.
I was told on the way up there that
I was to swear to anything those fel
lows put up to me because it would be
all right I was also told that If I
helped them, they would see that I
did not suffer. I was pretty drunk
"then. They commenced asking me
questions and I told them that I knew
Sidney Burch In Oklahoma. A day
or two before that I had been asked
If I knew a Sidney Burch and I told
them I knew him
"They made notes or It at tbe time.
Tbey had a shorthand man there mak
ing notes. We then went to another
office In the same building. I was
asked if Burch had ever been in the
penitentiary and I told the man that
I thought he had keen I was also
asked if I had ever changed my name
In my life. I was also asked If I was
the original Sidney Burch and I told
them 'no.
Asked to Make Oath.
"I had talked about this thing seven
Or eight days with some of tljese men
Then I talked with one of them about
a pieee of paper which he had and
which I had never seen nor read. He
asked me If I would g-o before a notary
public and testify that that which was
in the paper he had
"I read some of that paper, but not
all of it They asked me to change my
name to Sidney Burch. I said I was
afraid and one of the men said there
was nothing to it: it was merely to get
this fellow a new trial and he said It
would not hurt me a particle. I was
told that both sides were trying to
get young jurors and that the prose
cuting attorney had to do his duty, but
that he had sympathy for Roberson.
They tried to make it appear to me
that the prosecuting side was for ac
quittal. Papers Are Chnnced.
"Later the paper was read to me and
I was asked to sign it and I said I
would. I went to an office and signed
it Latei one of them told me he had

Answer to U. S.
BHRLIK,- Germany, April 22. Th
American note threatening a
breach of relations between tht
United States and Germany unlets Ger
many abandons what are termed Illegal
practices In connection with saDmarlnc
warfare, ia now In the hands of em
peror William, imperial caancelor vos
Bethmann Hollweg, ami Gen von Fal
kenhayn. chief of the general staff at
general headquarters
The Issue wa regarded as so mi
portant. it appears, that foreign mm
ister von Jagow, to whom the not
was delivered by ambassador Gerard,
wished the emperor and the imperial
chancelor to be advised at osee of the
gravity Of the situation.
The deliberations of the emperor,
the chancelor and the chief of stall
will determine the shaping of German
American relations
The American note, hitherto alto,
pother withheld from the public, ap
peared in the afternoon papers today.
All Is calm here.
Germany Wont Meet Demands.
Official sentiment here regarding the
American note on submarine warfare
seems to be that Germany cannol
wholly meet the American require
ments. The situation ia viewed with
I great gravity. No official expressloni
or opinion are uouudrdw.
It is known, however, that Germany's
answer is likely to be delayed by par
te vs between ambassador Gerard and
the German foreign office and between
the foreign office and ambassador von
Bernstorff at Washington. The im
perial government will also likely ask
the United States for further Informa
tion on certain points, according to the
Lokal Anzelger. The- Anzeiger says It
learns the American note is a decidedly
strong one and that it will be examined
with German thoroughness.
There Is little hope that the reply
can go to the length demanded by the
American government despite the fact
that Berlin Is anxious to retain amicable
relations with the United States.
Newspnpers Have Printed Little.
Prior to the publication of the note
the newspapers were permitted to print
nothing concerning it except one dis
patch sent from Washington by an
English news agency on Wednesdav.
This message was cabled before that
day's session of congress and appar
