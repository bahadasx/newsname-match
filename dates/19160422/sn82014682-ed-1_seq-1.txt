The Spaniard has been In the Hoof

tells the story of having been arrest
ed at Walmea for carrying a con
cealed weapon and fined 815 by the

depart from Waimea, ' although plac
ards describing ' him . and offering a
reward for his arrest were posted in

attemotlna to get the army bill, s
amended by the senate, up for appoint
ment of a conference committee..
The Republican house leaderJames
R. Mann of llilnola," has blocked the
attempts ' so far, making objections
that he has not had time to study the
situation thoroughly and that no hap
hazard action is wanted on th la im

It will be some time next Week, be
fore conference committees ; are ' ap
pointed and wilt meet to reconcile the
Hay bill, which passed the houseand
the Chamberlain bill, which almost
bodily was passed by the senate-as
an amendent to the house bill.

Chairman Hay late today made a par
liamentary move to meet the obstruc
tions offered by Mann. He Introduced
a resolution -for a special rule of the
house calling for an Immediate con
ference with the senate. The rules
committee will probably report fav
orably on it nextjweek, and the result
will be to hurry to perfection the
army bill, which the Democrats say.

that the demahds upon the revolution
ists: consist of three articles: First,
that his life be spared; second, that
the revolutionists allow Mm to control
his property;, and, third, to spare the
leaders of the monarchy propaganda,
and protect him from the revolution
ists. The. announcement by Yuan Shih
Kal has created a furore throughout

cussion throughout China as well as
In Tokio. The statement by Yuan fol
lows a demand made upon him by
the generals of the southern prov

Yuan .Sbih-Kai's resignation la ex
pected at' any time, as the Chinese
leaders In Tokio believe that the revo

the revolutionary party control in
China, and would mean the ending of
