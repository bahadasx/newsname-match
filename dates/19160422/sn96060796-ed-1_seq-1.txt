history. There have not been
a large number of games, but

Jerome, the center of copper

The . annual meeting of the
Arizona Good Roads Association,
in conjunction with the Arizona
Association of Highway En
gineers will be held at the rooms
of the Chamber of Commerce at
Phoenix on May 15th and 16th,

The executive committee has in
preparation an interesting pro

Petitions for the initiation of
an amendment to the state law,
providing that ten sections of
school land can be purchased or
leased for grazing purposes, in
stead of one section as at
present, were started here to
day. The amendment which is
known as Section 11, is being
strongly advocated by Pima
county cattlemen, who took up
the question at their meeting at
Nogales, Saturday. At present
the school lands are being sold
or leased to individual on appli
cation, but no one person is per
mitted to purchase or lease more
than 160 acres of agricultural
land, or more than one section
of grazing land. The grazing
land allowance, say the cattle
men, is too small, a single sec
tion being inadequate to the
needs of cattlegrowers of this
county. Star.
The new shaft at the Trench
has now reached a depth of over
150 feet, and has cut a vein of
rich silver ore. Other good
veins have been passed through
on the way down, some of high
grade ore, but it was the plan of
General Manager Hoy to sink
the shaft to a depth of at least
500 feet before any exploration
work in the way of cross-cutting
or drifting was done. Samples
of the recent strike exhibited in
Patagonia created a lot of favor
able comment from the old-timers,
who pronounce it "ruby

old Trench and Hermosa were
both producing. Drifting will

mine the extent-of the ore body,

sent out to the smelter within a
week or two. Patagonia.
Work on Coronation to Commence at
Once.
The Coronation, located in
close proximity to the Three R,
belonging to Ed. F. Bohlinger
and R. R. Richardson, has been
taken under option to purchase
by Franklin W. Smith, the en
gineer of Bisbee, who represents
Boston capital in the transaction.
The syndicate is composed of
men who are engaged in mining
as a business, and have made a
success of it in other localities.
They have planned a systematic
development of the Coronation
ground on a scale big enough
thoroughly to explore the ground
at a sufficient depth beneath the
outcrop to test it for the high
grade copper values they expect
to find.
A contract has been let to J.
R. Collie for a cross cut tunnel
directed towards the lode. By
the time this contract is finished
a road will have been construct
ed over which an engine and air
comoressor will be delivered at
the portal of the tunnel for the
further development of the prop
erty by the use of machine drills.
The syndicate is backing the
judgment of Mr. Smith, their
engineer, and have ample money
for the development planned.
The Coronation ground lies to
the south of the Three R mine
on the same lode, and as the
character of rock and outcrop of
the two are similar, it is the ex
pectation to open ore bodies
similar to those of the Three R.

STOCKMEN ORGANIZE,
Southwestern Cattle Growers' Asso
ciation Meets in Nogales.
In order that they might be
brought into closer touch with
each other and to pool their mu
tual interests for the betterment
of conditions pertaining to their
great industry, the cattlemen of
Santa Cruz, Pima and Cochise
counties met at the Court House
Saturday afternoon and formed
the Southwestern Cattle Grow
ers' Association. The meeting
was called at the request of the
recent organized Pima County
Cattle Growers' Association and
the organization partook of the
nature of a merging with this
body and an extension of the
field of operation.
In behalf of the mayor who
could not be present, Colonel
Charles E. Hardy, Collector of
Customs, delivered an address
of welcome to the assembled
cattlemen, promising them every
thing in the way of entertainment
to be had in Nogales. Colonel
Hardy's address was well re
ceived by the stockmen and
placed them in a receptive mood
for the business which was to
follow. This was followed by a
short talk by Judge William
Barnum, of Phoenix, attorney
for the Livestock Sanitary
Board. Judge Barnum's remarks
dealt with the value of co opera
tion with other associations of a
like nature and most especially
with the state association. He
was heartily applauded by the
audience. Mr. Henry Street, a
prominent Cochise cattlemau,
then delivered a few pointed re
marks on the value of proper or
ganization and caused much mer
riment by recounting his ex
periences of early days.
The first routine business to
be attended was the report of
the committee on constitution
and by-laws, of which Harry J.
Saxon was chairman and spokes
man. The committee recom
mended the adoption of the con
stitution and by laws of the Pi
ma county body with a few
slight changes such as the name
of the association.
Election of officers was then
held and the officers of the Pima
association were sustained by
popular acclaim. They are: Pre
sident, J. C. Kinney, Tucson;
vice-president, J. M. Ronstadt,
Tucson; secretary and treasurer,
J. H. McVey, Arivaca; Messrs.
J. E. Wise and Bracey C'irtis
were elected to service on the
executive committee with the
officers of the association.
The meeting was then address
ed by Hon. IV. E. Mouer, state
land commissioner, who explain
ed in a brief concise manner,
the proper way to apply for pur
chase or lease of state school
lands. At the close of his ad
dress Mr. Mouer answered a
number of questions from in
terested members. He also ad
vocated the endorsement of an
initiative measure to be voted
upon at next election, extending
the amount of land permitted to
be sold to one individual from
one section to ten sections. This
caused quite a controversy
among the members of the asso
ciation, the question brought up
by Judge Barnum in a proposed
resolution endorsing the meas
ure. After a heated argument of
several minutes, the resolution
was placed in the hands of the
proper committee for considera
tion and was adopted at their
recommendation. A telegram
was read from L. L. Harmon of
the Live Stock Sanitary Board,
regretting his inability to attend
and announcing the sad news of
the death of his nephew. The
committee on resolutions were
instructed to prepare a resolu
tion expressing the condolence
of the association to Mr. Harmon.
By a unanimous vote, the fol
lowing gentlemen were elected
to honorary membership in the
association: Col. Chas. E.
Hardy, Judge Williams, Hon. W.
A. Mouer, J. Selkirk. The place
for the next annual meeting was
fixed for Tucson. The meeting
was then adjourned until 8 p. m.
when a short business meeting
was held prior to the big smoker
at the Santa Cruz club. Herald.

DIVIDENDS IN MARCH.
American mines and works
broke all records for dividend
disbursements in March last.
According to reports made to
Mining and Engineering World,
dividends during the month were
paid totaling $21,113,138.
Not only were March records
broken but disbursements for
the first three months of the
year were the largest on record,
exceeding those for the three
months of 1914, the previous re
cord year, by nearly $12,000,000.
In the quarter just ended 103
companies contributed with pay
ments totaling $36,254,017, as
compared with $18,202,932 by
70 companies in 1915, $24,785,556
by 94 companies in 1914, and
$23,304,820 by 114 companies in
1913. This snows a remarkable
gain in 1916 over previous years
and makes a record of achieve
ment never equaled by any other
line of industry.
The above does not include
the disbursements made by the
so called holding companies, a
large part of whose revenue is
derived from operations of their
own mines. Take, for instance,
the Copper tueen Copper com
pany, whose profits go to swell
the disbursements of Phelphs,
Dodge & Co. Then there is the
Kennecott corporation, which is
earning on its copper operations
in Alaska better than $8 a share
a year, or double what it is now
paying. Others might be men
tioned to show that much of the
$20,839,303 disbursed during the
first three months of 1916 by
seven securities-holding corpora
tions should rightfully be credit
ed to the operating companies.
In summarizing the dividends
paid in the first quarter of 1916
we find that the 103 companies
contributing have made total
payments of $909,535,612. On
their combined issued capital this
is a return of $235,408,316 in ex
cess of outstanding capital.
Holders of shares of copper
stocks were indeed fortunate for
dividends were paid during
March totaling $11,979,489. Dur
ing the quarter, wjth 27 com
panies participating, dividends
have been divided among share
holders amounting to $20,859, 161.
This compares with $5,686,478
during the first quarter of 1915,
$13,391,828 by 24 companies in
1913. To date the 27 companies
paying dividends in 1916 have
disbursed no less than $510,130,
182. Issued capital of these com
panies totals $299,840,520, show
ing a return of not far from 200
per cent.
The Tombstone district at pre
sent is the scene of more mining
activity than for some time, and
the indications are that within a
few more months it will show
much greater improvement. The
Bunker Hill Company has now
nearly five hundred ajen on the
pay roll, which is the largest
number employed since they
took over the property of the
old Tombstone Consolidated.
The work is not confined to any
one part of the district, but on
some twenty claims, and ore
shipments are increasing.
