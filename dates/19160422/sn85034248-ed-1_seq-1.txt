"The Deep Purple," an intensely
interesting photo-version of the pow
erful stage play of the same name by
Paul Armstrong and Wilson Mizner,
will be the Easter offering at the Gem
Theatre. Clara Ki iball Young,
usiversally acclaimed "qt:un of the
screen," has the leading i _e in the
production, a brief synopsis : which
follows:
Frisuo Kate, otherwise Mrs. Fallon,
a reformed thief, keeps a boarding
house in New York. which is fequent
ed by members of the underworld,
who still keep a hold on Kate, not
withst-in iett her desire to reform.
William Lake, a western engineer, is
decoyed to her rooms by an innocent
girl, Doris Moore, who has been
brought to New York by Harry Le
land, a crook, under promise of mar
riage.
Posing as the girl's husband, Le
land attempts to blackmail Lake, but
the latter has been yarned by "Frisco
Kate" and defies Leland and the
gang.
Meanwhile, Leland and two other
crooks, Clark and Connolly, have be
trayed to the police Gordon Laylock,
upon whose head a heavy price has
been set for various murders in the
west, and to whom Frisco Kate has
extended her sympathy.
To repay Frisco Kate for his kind
ness, Lake helps her buy Laylock's
way out of prison. No sooner is he
free than, joining Frisco Kate, he
saves William Lake from Leland's
(the "Badger's") murderous attack
and shoots him in self-defense.
Laylock and Mrs. Fallon seek op
portunities for complete reform in
Algiers, and the westerner, Lake,and
Doris Moore, the innocent decoy, be
come sincere Idvers and are married.
Alice Brady in "The Rack."
A thrilling story of the escape of a
young wife from the evil consequences
of her amorous indiscretions is told
in "The Rack," a five-part picturiza
tion of the memorable stage success
of the same name, which will be the
offering at the Gem Monday. Alice
Brady, one of the most gifted and
popular young stars of the silent
drama, plays the leading role in this
powerful production, and is supported
by a strong cast of film favorites.
An outline of the gripping plot is as
follows:
Blanche Gordon lives unhappily with
her husband. There is some jealousy
on both sides, and of this fact Jack
Freeman, a devil-may-care man about
town, takes advantage. Jack has quar
reled with his own wife, Louise, on
account of his attentions to other
women. It was he who sowed discard
between Donald McKenzie and his
wife Effie. This unhappy girl com
mitted suicide, and Donald Mc
Kenzie went abroad and became in
ebriate in his trouble. When he
returned to New York, he swore to be
avenged on Freeman.
Freeman, by a trick, lures Blanche
Gordon to a disreputable roadhouse.
There she is discovered by her hus
band, Tom Gordon, in a compromising
position with Freeman. There is a
quarrel between the two men and
i Freeman is shot. Blanche Gordon is
arrested for the murder, and in
court after being subjected to a
racking examination by the district
attorney, she swears that she killed
Freeman in defense of her honor. It
looks as though she will be condemned
for the murder, when Donald Mc
Kenzie come.5 forward to depose that
it was he who had killed Freeman for
having robbed him. McKenzie, of his
wife.
After- the trial, Blanche Gordon
and her husbaid are reconciled.
"The Lure of Heart's Desire."
"The Lure of Heart's Desire," a
startling five-part Metro wonder
play, in which Edmund Breese, the
gifted dramatic star., is seen in the
stellar role, will be the feature at
traction at the Grand Theatre to
nmorrow.
This gripping photodrama of the
Alaskan wastes and high life in New
York society ile:Js with Ipim Carew,
a sturdy lighthouse keeper, who saves
the life of Ethel Wyndham, a young
Society woman, when her boat crashes
upon the rocks near his po.t. Soon
after her recovvry she is returned to
the mainland aad to hnc friends, and
-Carew, dis oi of t; beta s of his
unrequited love for the I i', gives
up the lighthou ii. In his subsequent
wanderings he becomes possessed of
the gold fever' and joi a prospect
ing party in a rush to the Yukon.
In the Yukon, Carew is =uccessful
from the :tat. lie strikes a big
cla:in, and so~o, aases a fortune.
On the last night of hi. first week in
the-Yukon, Carew joins a group of
Miners celebrating in the leading sa
lQoon Little Snow Bird, a beautiful
Indian girl, strolls into the place,
and immediately catches Carew's
fancy. Crazy Jake, one of the miners,
who is known for his fearlessness and
brawn, proposes that the miners all
cut the cards for the girl, the holder
of the highest card to claim her as
his own.
Carew resents this proposal, and
he and Crazy Jake come to blows.
Carew bests the bully in the en
counter and is hailed as the hero of
the camp. Little Snow Bird's heart
goes out to Carew, and surreptitiously
she follows him wherever he goes.
One night he falls in a big snow
storm, and it is Little Snow Bird who
finds him and carries him to safety.
Afterward, they live together.
Carew, with all the money at his
command that he desires, tires of the
camp life in the desolate Alaskan
wastes, and pines for one more fling
of the Great White Way, He arranges
to go to New York for one trip and
then return to his Little Snow Bird
for life. Carew nrrpres in New York
on New Year's eve, He engages a
table in Murray's restaurant, one of
the smartest and gayest places in
town. There he observes Ethel
Wyndham at another table, and im
mediately joins her party. Now that
he is wealthy, she is willing to listen
to his renewed vows of love. She
agrees to marry Carew, but her
companioin, Thomas Martin, a so
ciety ieech and gambler, prevents
her by threatening to expose her for
some shady blackmailing transactions
they have been engaged in together.
Ethel is driven to renounce Carew,
and he, realizing her character at
last, is broken hearted. Back on the
Yukon the little Indian girl is waiting
for him. She despairs of Carew ever
returning, and takes her own life at
her father's deathbed. Carew now re
members his Indian sweetheart, and
decides to go back to her, renouncing
society as frivolous and a sham. He
arrives there on the very night that
Snow Bird dies. But at her side he
finds a new-born baby-another little
Snow Bird. During the years that
follow, Carew devotes himself to the
daughter, and lavishes every luxury
upon her, in memory of the mother.
Mary Pickford in "Madame
Butterfly."
A new and hitherto unsuspected
Mary Pickford is revealed in the Cho
Cho-San she so admirably plays in
the magnificent photo y version of
John Luther Long's cl sic, "Madame
Butterfly," 'ch will be the offering
.at the Grand y: The grew mass
of admirers of ' ary Pickford who
have been accustomed to see their
favorite as a little blonde beauty will
be astounded to ind her a thorough
Oriental. It is not a matter of make
up alone, but of real histrionic ability.
Instead of the delightful little oc
cidental girl who has flirted, smiled
and wept her way through many ad
ventures and romances, Miss Pickford
becomes an entrancing, powerfully
emotional Japanese girl whose por
tr-aynl of the sufferings, grief and
anguish of the deserted wife, though
enacted with the utmost dignity and
force, is at the same time far above
anything she has ever attempted in
sympathetic treatment.
The story is the familiar and be
loved one of the trusting little Nip
ponese who is married to a lieutgnant
in the United States Navy, He sails
away on his vessel, promising to
return. He does--but it is with an
American wife. And the broken
hearted little Japanese girl, carefully
shielding her babe from the dreadful
sight, stabs herself and dies in the
arms of the man who deceived her,
her grief-scarred face softened into'
smiles of infinite delight by the joy
of dying in her lover's embrace.
A Style Show All By Herself.
Valeska Suratt, the most discussed
woman of the stage or screen, is, as
is known to theatregoers the country
over, the fashion-plate of the dra
matic profession. Her gowns have
made millions gasp by their beauty
and daring as well as by their daz
zling lavishness of design. In making
her screen debut in "The Soul of
Broadway," which comes to the Grand
Tuesday, Miss Suratt has outdone
all her previous efforts in gowns and
millinery, fashioned by famous mo
distes.
In all she wears 150 gowns, some
daringly and uniquely'a simple; others
that are calculated to make the
feminine portion of her spectators
break into astonished exclamations
when they see them. It is estimated
that in the course of "The Soul of
Broadway" Miss Suratt changes her
garments with every forty feet of
film. Many of them are designed to

match the "sets" of the picture, which
latter in themselves are quite unlike
anything yet seen in a motion picture,
and were especially designed for Wil
liam Fox by a celebrated artist of the
ultra-modern school.
"Armstrong's Wife."
Edna Goodrich, most beautiful of
American dramatic actresses, will
make her photoplay debut in the
strong dramatic feature, "Arm
strong's Wife," which comes to the
Grand Wednesday. The star only re
cently returned to the UnitedStates
after a year of nerve-wrecking ex
periences as a nurse in war hospitals
in Europe. Her own beautiful home
near London is now being used for
convalescent wounded.
"Armstrong's Wife" provides Miss
Goodrich with those opportunities for
her dramatic talent which have given
her fame here and abroad. She ap
pears as a young woman, for whose
affections two men are seeking. Dis
appointed, unhappy and discouraged
after a few months with one of them
who she discovered was married, May,
as portrayed by Miss Goodrich, con
I sents to lose herself in the Canadian
wilds with her other suitor. This man
offers his name only to her, Subse
quently, at a meeting of the three
principals in this strange case, wrong
is righted.
A Feature in Colors.
One of the most beautiful produc
tions that the Grand has yet offered
to its patrons will be "The Beloved
Vagabond," a picturization in colors
of the celebrated novel of the same
name by William J. Locke, which is
announced as the booking for Thurs
day, April 27. "The Beloved Vaga
bond" is a six-reel Pathe Gold
Rooster feature, and is one of the
first long pictures to be reproduced
in color. The Strand Theatre in New
York city showed it for a whole wee
mnd packed the house at each per
fom mance. Edwin Arden in the title
role gives another evidence of his re
markable ability as a screen actor,
and the supporting cast is consister t
ly strong and capable. Edward J se
directed the production, and with such
artistic skill has he- outlined the sig
nificance of Locke's delightful theme
that there is little left to be desired
to make the Pathe production a smngu
larly perfect one.
Unique Double-Feature Attraction.
A novel attraction is in store for
patrons of the Granid next F1riday;
when the Paramount Pictures Corpo
ration will present two photo-pioduc
tions of world-famous stories as a
single double-feature release.
"Booties' Baby," by the noted au
thor, John Strange Winter, and "The
Man on the Case," by the celebrated
dramatist, Grace Livingston Furniss,
the first in four reels and the second
in two, provide the evening's enter
tainment, and real entertainment,
it is-or rather, they are!
"Booties' Baby" tells the story of
a little infant, who, with its mother,
is deserted by the husband and father.
The cheerfulness with which the baby
accepts its lot, and the bewitching
manner in which it. brings to the de
spairing young mother a new interest
in life, will promptly and lastingly
win the sympathies of all spectators.
"The Man on the Case" relates the
humorous adventures of a young,
handsome millionaire who wins the
heart of the girl he loves as apparent
ly a penniless man, because she has
determined not to marry a man for
his money. The delicious humor of
the situation in which she discovers
that her fiance is, after all, a million
aire, is nearly indescribable, and pro
vides one of the most laugh-provoking
incidents seen on the screen in recent
times.
Why Constipation Injures.
The bowels are the natural sewer
age system of the body. When they
become obstructed by constipation a
part of the poisonous matter which
they should carry off is absorbqd into
the system, making you feel dull and
stupid, and interfering with the di
gestion and assimilation of food.

SCHOOL FARM ENLARGED.
More Land and New Building For
East Ascension Institution.
The following paragraphs apper- I
taining to the Oak Grove agricultural
Jhigh school. ,i this parislh are quoted
frm reenit; reportt of~ ); :~ adGil-.
beau, state inspector of agricultural
schools:
"I met Mr. Broussard, the parish {
superintendent, and Mr. Stuart, the
president of the school board, at this
school, to discuss the situation of the
school and farm. After having in
spected the school and farm and dis
cussed the matter we decided the
farm should have at least five more
acres of land to make it as successful
as it should be. No land being for
sale in the immediate neighborhood of
the school at the present time, the
agriculturist was authorized to rent {
five acres. It was decided, also, that
a building 30 by 20 feet should be
built for a workshop. This building
will be completed by next session.
"We found the financial condition {
of the farm to be good. The live
stock was also found to be in fine con
dition. A nice young short-horn bull
has recently been purchased and a
shed built for it. The hogs are doing
well and are being grazed every day
on the winter cover crops. Both
sows will farrow within a few days,
and as they are fine animals I feel
satisfied we will have no trouble in
disposing of the pigs.
"Mr. Babin, the agriculturist, ten
dered his resignation, to become ef
fective at once, and E. C. Jefferson,
a graduate of the Louisiana State
University, was employed as-agricul
turist. Mr. Jefferson has been working
in the University dairy since he grad
uated and should make a good man.
"I was satisfied with general condi
tions at the school. Strong clubs are
being organized and plenty of interest
taken by the members. The work on
the farm is also well advanced and the
land in good condition. The drains
are open and the land well drained."
Banks Aid Extension Work.
The increasing interest being man
ifested in agricultural extension
work and the financial aid given it
by the country banks of Louisiana is
very encouraging. A report recent
ly compiled by the extension division
of L S. U. shows that .72 banks, lo
cated in 26 different parishes, are
rendering financial aid to some phase
of extension work in the state this
year.' This money is used in helping
to pay salaries of local agents, pro
viding scholarships at the winter short
course at L. S. U. for boys and girls
who make good records in club work,
providing prizes for agricultural ex
hibits at parish fairs, and purchasing
live stock and seed for club members
to begin their work.

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
41 r Camp Street, New Orleans.
Rival Politics.
Looks as though the political
parties were trying to outdo each
other in the race to bring about the
ballot for women. Virginia Republi
cans passed a resolution which says:
"We favor suffrage being extended to
women and therefore favor the en
actment of all laws necessary to the
accomplishment of this end." That
was a good stiff endorsement, but
the Democrats of Kansas have made
their position clear by electing a
woman, Mrs. W. A. Harris, as del
egate-at-large to the national Dem
ocratic convention in St. Louis.
There will be a number of women
delegates from the states in which
women are voters. Time for the
south to wake up and recognize she
has women as gifted, as wise and
as trust-worthy as the states which
have given the ballot to their women.
A High-Thinking Senator.
The Democratic state convention
in Oklahoma City paid a high tribute
to United States Senator Robert L.
Owen, when it endorsed him as
worthy of "any office within the gift
of the nation." This enthusiastic en
dorsement will meet the approval of
Oklahoma women as well as men" as
Senator Owen has stood loyally for
all state and national measures pur
posing equal opportunities and rights
for women. It is significant that the
advocates of votes for women include
so large a perc t of high-thinking,
clean-record men.
Insult to Mississippi Women.
Practically every woman's organ
ization in Mississippi sent a repre
sentative to Jackson to I plead wth
the legislature to pass the bill making
women eligible to serve on public
school and eleemosynary boards. Not
withstanding the array of influential
women the bill failed of passage and
the women who were present in the
gallery were astounded at the vulgar
comparison suggested by a senator
who coupled women in politics with
"hogs in a wallow."
States Rights the Slogan.
"Woman Suffrage by the States
Rights Route" is the slogan of south
ern suffragists. This is a good Demo
cratic rallying cry and a staunch
Democratic principle. All right, ladies,
here's where the soiith can show that
its chivalry is a living fact or a de
cayed myth.
