EOIHT HOUR LAW APPLIES TO
MEN WORKING IN QUARRIES
Some time ago the American Carrara
..,i.ia mmiumv asked Labor. Commis
sioner Wallace if the eight-hour law'
for mining applied to quarrying, and i
the question was subnuttea Dy axi . a.
lace (to Attorney General Thatcher for
.' fn opinion. The opinion, which sus-t
W tains the labor commissioner, says the
Carson Appeal, is as follows:
lows:
Carson City, March SO, 1016.
Hon. W. 12. Waluc.e, Labor Commis
sioner, Carson City, Nevada.
Vear 'Sir: I am in receipt ot youi
verbal request as to whether the eight
'hour law applies to men working in
marble quarries.
-SeiJ.Jm S57 ti the HevUed Laws of.
Nevada," 1912, provides as follows:
"The period of employment of work
ing men in open-pin fiid open-cut mines
.shall not exceed eight hours In any
twenty-four hours, except in cases where
life or property is in Imminent dan
ger." The question Involved is whether a
marble quarry Is an open-pit or open
cut mine.
In 27 CYC at page 531 la found tint
following:
' "The primary meaning of the word
'mine,' standing alone, is . an under
ground excavuj ion made for the pur
'pose of getting minerals; a pit or
cavatlon in the earth from when met
allic ores or other mineral substances
are taken by digging. It is also ex
tended' to a quarry or place where any
thing is dug."
Again on page 532 of the same vol
ume of CYC we find the following:
"Mineral Is not confined to melfila
only; but prlmurlly means all substan
ces (other than the agricultural surface
of the ground such as stone or clay."
In the cuse of Hendler vs. LehiglX
Valley It. U. Co., 209 Pa., St. Rep.i
260, the court held that marble was,
a mineral. Also in the case of Itin
ledge vs.Kress, 17 Pa.. Supr. Ot., Kep.
199, Hjie super'or court held that build
Ing stone was a mineral within the
'statute. The reasoning ln these cases
Is to the effcet that subtances valua
ble for building purposes are minerals.
Under 'the laws of the United Stat
es land chiefly valuable for building
stone are permitted to be located as
place claims, and this would indi
icute that quarries are to be consider
Vd as mines.
I am, therefore, of tho opinion (.kut
the eight hour lav applies to men work
ing in marble quarries in this state.
Yours very truly,
GEO. B. THATCH EU,
Attorney General.
On "the receipt of Attorney General
Thatcher's opinion in the matter the
labor commissioner directed the fol-
:'. lowing letter to the marble company at
Carrara:
To the American Carrara Company,
"i Carrara, Nevada.
Liean Sirs: Referring to your letter
t March 17, in which you state that
. you cannot Hee wherein the eight hour
law for mining applies to quarrying, 1

along the snake range, and now comes
Ule repon. that thev are ai,.eady being
used with pronounced success at Atjolia
as the following from the itandsburg lie
publican will attest:
"The big gulch following the llands-
hurg-Atolia road is virtually cut up by
'olacer workers, some of w hom are
dry washing, while others have huge
tanks, which are utilized for wet
washing wth water, hauled from Rands
burg. Some of this ground is said to
produce $4 to 12 a cubic yard. The
problem seems to be how to separate
the white, yellow and black concentrates
and get water cheap enough to make tl a
work piof.'KThlo. Jim nice has afrae

t!ixne TUford, a veteran gold placer
mine;- of Oceola, has a dry washing'
machine which he will try out on tung
sten ground In the near future. . Dry
washing machines which have proven a
success in recovering gold values can be
had from Stultun, Steel & Steel of
Denver, Colorado. . There are also
other machines on the t.iarket.
If dry washes can be used with
i success, a vast field of energy will
at once be opened up, which will soon
rival in wealth production the best
