While answering an alarm shortly after
11 o'clock this morning, the automobile
of Deputy Fire Chief Sullivan struck
Crossing Policeman Frank T. Ippolito.
stationed at 7th and F streets, and seriously
injured him.
Policeman Ippolito is unconscious at
the Emergency Hospital with a fractured
skull and probable serious internal injuries.
According to eyewitnesses to the
accident he had just been successful in
makine: a little irirl step back on the
curb out of the path of the fast fire ap- s
paratus. r
The firebox at 7th and K streets had
been pulled for a fire at 1004 7th street j
northwest after No. 6 engine company i
had answered a local call. Persons in t
the vicinity of 7th and F streets said (
their attention was attracted by the <
blowing of the loud siren installed in the i
firebox post at 9th and F streets, when v
they saw the fire chief's automobile turn
into F street from 8th street, and then e
come east. g
Effort to Wave Child Back.
Policeman Ippolito had ^cleared the
streets and waved back all traffic, according
to the story told by several
witnesses. He was standing on the
platform, but as the apparatus approached
the corner a little girl
stepped down off the curbing at the
northwest corner, and Ippolito stepped
i<jwa.rd the child in an effort to wfive it
i,.irs to the curb. As the child stepped
bacK quickly the chief's automobile
around the corner and struck him.
The witnesses declare that the machine
d:ti not go around the center of the
: ts-eet. but cut to the left-hand corner,
hi<-h was the northwest curbing.
The machine struck the policeman,
c. i, i it iv:?s ilp. larprf stood him richt on <
iijs head. The car did not run over him.
but flopped in a short space. Chief
S jilivan did not proceed to the fire, but
had his chauffeur, William Nash, draw
up to the curb, and went back- to the
injured man. |
i rivate William Nash, who was driving
the car. said that he turned into F
street and saw the policeman give the
right of way. The officer was standing
on the platform, he said, when suddenly
he jumped to the center of the street,
in the path of the automobile, and was
hit. N'ash said that he did not know
how fast he was going, but he had cut
down his speed somewhat in order to
make the turn. The large bell, which
projects in front of the radiator hit
the policeman squarely in the chest. {
Crossing Policeman James H. Clem- i
ent.?, stationed at 7th and G streets, I .
on!> a short distance away, said that he j 5
could see the accident from his stand, i
He said he heard the siren and had his J j
crossing clear, and was looking down I
7th street for the engines. He saw i x
lppolito standing in the street, and v
then saw the car come speeding around ! F
the corner on the wrong side and hit
the officer. '

DISTRICTBILLS FAIL
lepresentative Vinson's Action
Kills Unanimous Consent
Calendar Project.
HIS MOTION TO ADJOURN
CARRIED IN COMMITTEE
Public Forum, Bad Check and Fake
Auction Bills Among Those
Seriously Affected.
Representative Vinson of Georgia
:hrew a monkey wrench into the machinery
of the District committee tolay,
shortly after the committee met
ror the purpose of establishing a
'unanimous consent" calendar, which
.vould be instrumental in turning out
i large number of favorable reports on
proposed District legislation. Because
Representative Vinson believed that
the bills should be considered in the
committee at length, he offered a moJon
to adjourn within a few minutes
tfter the committee met today. The
notion carried.
According to Chairman Johnson, this
>rocedure knocks out any chance that
lad existed for the bills to go to a
mantmous consent calendar and re eive
a favorable report in a hurry.
Chairman Johnson called attention to
he fact that many of the bills which
re re blocked today by Representative
riiison had previously been referred
0 the subcommittee of which Reprelentative
Vinson is chairman.
Included Forum Bill.
As has been explained previously,
Chairman Johnson proposed a calendar
>f bills for expediting reports. This
calendar would contain bills to which
to one had an objection. He sent out
1 notice for a committee meeting to be
leld today, and included a list of thirty
frills, and on the list was the public
orum bill, to which there is strong objection
on the part of Representative
Vinson and Representative Ragsdale;
he bad check bill and the fake auction
Dill. The notice contained a reference
o the committee action authorizing the
calling of the meeting today and also
3a id:
"Under the resolution, no bill can be
considered unless it be set out by number
and title in the notice sent to each
member of the committee advising him
of the time flxed for the meeting;
neither can any bill be so set out by
lumber and title he considered at said
meeting if objection is made by any
member present."
If the meeting had progressed, it is
frossible some ?f the bills could have
been in shape for a favorable report,
but the expressions of opinion frotn
seme of the committeemen afteri the
idjournrrent seemed to be in opposition
:o all of the bills simply because of the
presence of a few bills, such as the
forum measure and the proposed
Lmendment to the loan shark law.
Measures Included in List.
The list of bills included the followng
measures
To close barber shops on Sunday; to
npose a special license tax on motor
chicles: to nenovate the college
voman's dormitory at Columbia Inititute
for the Deaf, to authorize a
loliday on Columous day; to provide
for annual assessments on real estate;
n a m tb>a a '
consideration bill": to regulate the
aking of cash retents on contracts;

'or the use of public school buildings
is community forums; to provide for
tdditional methods for enforcing and
'oreclosing tax sales; to prevent fraud
at public auctions. Other hills included
related to minor street matters,

Representative Vinson indicated tolay
that the bills before his stjl.comnittee

'GERMANS PREDICT
i FURTHER PARLEYS
j ?
! Delay in Answer to American
Note Likely as Result of Requests
for Information.
| KAISER, CHANCELLOR AND
ARMY CHIEF CONFER
No Expression of Opinion on Situation
Obtainable at Berlin
Foreign Office-.
RRKI.IN. April 22. 1.0 a.m. (via London,
4 :3r? p.m.) ? Germany's answer to
the latest American note is likely to be
delayed by some parleys and requests for
further information on certain points, according
to the lx>kal Anzeiger, which says
it learns that the note is a decidedly long:
one and that it will be examined with
German thoroughness.
The American note is now in the
hands of Emperor William, Chancellor
von Bethmann-Hollweg and Gen. von
Falkenhayn, chief of the general staff,
at general headquarters.
A summary of the note was telegraphed
yesterday to general headquarters.
and a. courier, bearing the
full text and the appendix, was sent
there by train.
The deliberations of the emperor, the
chancellor and the chief of staff will
determine the future shaping of German-American
relations.
The note appears in the newspapers
of this afternoon. All is calm here.
I Tbo 4mArif?nn nntp in reerard to sub
marine warfare was delivered to Foreign
Minister von Jagow in the usual
manner, with no attendant circumstances
to mark the unusual importance
of the occasion.
Ambassador Gerard rolled the document
in a magazine, to protect it from
a slight rain which was falling, and
walked across the square to the foreign
office. The ambassador was received
immediately. The foreign minister
read the note, and a short general conversation
followed.
No expression of opinion is obtainable
from the foreign office, where absolute
reticence is maintained.
Ministers Receive Copies.
The ministers and other officials who
were entitled to it have received a copy
of the note and have been studying the
document.
As far as the Associated Press has
been made acquainted with the sentiment
in higher quarters, it would be
wrong to regard it as anything but extremely
grave. There is little hope that
any answer can go to the length demanded
by the Washington government,
despite the fact that the government
desires to maintain good relations
with'the United States. The sentiment
is against any weakening of Germany's
submarine campaign, to say nothing of
an abandonment of it.
Clemenceau Admires Message.
PARIS, April 22.?Unqualified admiration
of President Wilson's message to
Berlin on the submarine issue is expressed
by Georges Clemenceau in his
newspaper, L'Homme Libre. In an extended
analysis of the message M.
Clemenceau says:
"What strikes one above all in this
piece of world diplomacy which the
chief of the American republic has submitted
to the national representatives
is its fine, impassive objectivity;
neither complaints nor recriminations.
Facts. No signs of literature, contrary
to what we have seen in the case of
other countries; nothing, too, of the
learned lawyer, by happy surprise.
Simple, strong words of a statesman.
"The right, the august iinprescripti
ble right which the pilgrim fathers of
the Mayflower brought from Europe,
their sons are bringing back to us under
a shield of iron, forged by their
own strong hands.
"Hail to you, American citizens, who
march back into the history of Europe
under a great arch on the front of
which Washington, .Jefferson and so
many others have carved the noblest
claims of humanity!
"What the kaiser may decide to do is
unimportant. Withdrawal or bombast?
it will all be the same in the end."
Two Messages Received
From Envoy to Germany
Regarding Note's Delivery
? With official word that the United
Stnte3 note has been presented to the
Berlin foreign office, administration
officials expect uefiinite advices shortly
j from Ambassador Gerard as to how the
I communication was received, together
with some indication as to the nature
of the German reply.
In reporting the delivery of the note
late Thursday afternoon. Ambassador
Tierard advised the State Department
that iie had afterward conferred briefly
(with Foreign Minister von Jagow. The
? contents of another message from the
ambassador were closely guarded, alI
though it Is said that he informed the
J department that assurances bad boon
( given him of immediate consideration
of the document. Some officials in|
dicated today that they looked for a
I reply front Germany by the middle of
: next week.
Count von Bernstorff Away.
i
! count von Bernstorff. the German amI
bassador, who is away on a brief trip,
i is not expected to return here before
I Monday, unless important dispatches regarding
the submarine Issue are received
at the embassy before that time. It is
j said that he has advised his government
! to modify its submarine warfare to meet
j the latest demands of the United States,
j Chairman Stone of the Senate foreign
j relations committee has an appointment
to g?> over the situation with ('resident

1 then will inform Senator Stone of any in|
formation at hand from Germany up to
I that time. When the American note was
| dispatched officials said they considered

demand for an immediate answer. At

Search Proves Falsity of Story Told
by Convict Begarding
Missing Girl.
NEW YORK, April 22? The body of
Dorothy Arnold was not found in the
cellar of the house outside West Point,
where New York detectives searched
yesterday. Police Inspector Faurot.
who is in charge of the investigation,
announcing today that there was no
truth in published stories that Miss Arnold's
body had been discovered.
Inspector Faurot expressed his opinion
that there was nothing to the story
told by Octave Charles Glennorris, a
convict in a Rhode Island prison, that
he aided in the burial in a West Point
cellar of a young woman resembling
Miss Arnold.
Inspector Faurot's Statement.
One of the detectives who conducted
the search had been quoted as saying
a body was found under the cement
flooring in an isolated house two miles
south of West Point, but Inspector
Faurot said "all we found in the cellar
j was an old four-inch water main."
"The story told by Glennorr s is a"toj
soluteiv false," added the inspector,

ris' motive in telling his story was the
! hope Of obtaining parole.

Germans Said to Have Used Liquid ,
Fire in Futile Attempt North
of Caurettes Wood.
LONDON*. April 22.?The Oernians |
have resumed the offensive before Ver- |
dun. putting- their infantry in action j
on both banks of the Meuse. but failing ;
to gain additional ground, according to
the French war office bulletin.
The principal attempt to advance was
made east of the Meuse following an
intense bombardment. Paris reports
that the French artillery foiled the attempt
and caused the Germans heavy
losses. The scene of this fighting was
between the river and Fort Vaux.
To the west, just beyond the Meuse,
the Germans put liquid fire into play
in attacking the French lines north of
the Caurettes wood, but the assault is
declared to have been barren of advantage
to the crown prince's forces.
French Statement.
, The text of the statement follows:
"In Belgium ouf artillery energetically
cannonaded the sector east of the
Ypres-Pilkelm road during an actioa at
this point by British troops.
"West of the Meuse the enemy during
the night attacked our positions on the
slopes north of Dead Man's hill. The
Germans, who had succeeded in gaining
a foothold ih our first line, were ejected
soon after by a counter attack
which swon back for us all the terrain
previously conauered by us. Another
attack. In which liquid Are was used,
was delivered against, our trenches
north of the Caurettes wood. It was
completely repulsed.
Advances Prevented.
"East of the Meuse at the close of the
day yesterday following an intense
bombardment of our lines from the
Meuse as far as Fort Vaux, the Germans
brought up large bodies of troops
into their trenches on the front between
the pond and Fort Vaux in preparation
for an attack. Artillery bombardments,
immediately launched prevented
an advance and caused serious
losses to the enemy.
"In the L? Pretre wood there was
some fighting between patrols. On the
rest of the front the night was calm."
British Communication.
The British official communication issued
last evening says:
"There has been mining activity near
Fricourt, Souchez. Hulluch and Givenchy.
During last night we dispersed a
party of Germans who left their
trenches near St. Eloi.
"There has been trench and mortar
fighting south of Arras and artillery
duels between Souchez and La Basse
canal and in the neighborhood of
Ypres."

according to the German official statement
of today, which admits losses to
the enemy. It says:
"On the Langemarck-Ypres high road
the English early in the morning attacked
the trenches which our patrols
captured April 19. The enemy reoccupiea
about one-third of the positions.
"On both sides of La Bassee canal we
exploded a few mines'with good results.
"Enemy fire upon the towns of Lens
and Roye resulted in further victims
among the civil population. At Roye
one child was killed and two women
and a child injured.
"In the Argonne we destroyed French
outpost positions on the hill of La
Fille Morte by mine explosions. We occupied
an extensive crater before outfront.
"West of the Meuse the French repeated
their efforts in the region of
Dead Man's hill. They twice bombarded
with combined artillery and machine
gun fire both banks of the river.
The third attack broke down with
heavy losses hefoi e our positions.
"Fierce hand grenade engagements
for a trench section in the neighborhood
of t'aurettes wood resulted in us
recovering this section toward evening.
During the night the French
again succeeded in obtaining a foothold
in this wood.
"East of ihe Meuse at the steinbruch
stone quarry), south of Haudremont
and south of Fort Douaumont there was
lively a ninety activity, together with
grenade and bomb fighting. The artillery
continued without interruption
day and night its customary local violence
on the entire battle front in the
Meuse district. '
"In the region northwest of Fresnes- J
En-Woevre prisoners were taken be- <
longing to the 154th French division. '
This proves that in the region between
this town and Avocourt since February ;
21 thirty-eight divisions were employed,
of which four divisions after a
long rest were reinforced by fresh
drafts taken chiefly from the recruits
of the class of 1910 who were brought
into the battle and beaten." ,

REPORT FROM GEN. SCOTT
DUE HERE BEFORE NIGHT
Conferring at San Antonio on All
Phases of the Mexican
Campaign.
CARRANZA MASSING FORCES
Instructions Go Forward to Gen.
Pershing to Be Prepared to Resist
Aggression From Any
Quarter.
SAX AXTOXIO. Tex., April
22.?Secretary of War Baker
should be in receipt of a report
before night by Mai. Gen. Hugh
L. Scott, .chief of staff of the
army, that may assi-t the administration
in deciding whether to
withdraw the American troops or '
send them farther into Mexico.
Overnight dispatches from thai
front indicated no renewed offensive
activity. The pursuit of the
bandit chieftain remained practically
at a standstill, and the im
pression is gaining strength at
departmental headquarters that
the troops will be withdrawn.
Pershing Beady to Fight.
Gens. Scott and Funston today will
review in detail the history of the
punitive expedition's operations since
entering Mexico, almost six weeks ago.
Gen. Funston has received reports
showing movements of Carranza troops
In the district penetrated by Gen.
Pershing, and others have been sent to
Gen. Pershing:, authorizing: him to prepare
for any aggTessive. Carranza officials
have given plausible reasons for
moving the forces of Gen. Arnulfo
Gomez eastward from Sonora, the
troops of Gen. Luis Herrera south from
Chihuahua to Parral and a considerable
force toward Casas Grandes, but should
the war office at Mexico City decide
later to use these forces to prevent further
American military operations Gen.
Pershing will be prepared for any situation.
Review of the Campaign.
Until late last night Gens. Scott and
Funston discussed the developments of
the pursuit of Villa that began with
promised co-operation by Carranza
troops and ended or practically ended
with a warning to Col. W. C. Brown at
Santa Cruz by a. Carranza official that
he must not advance south of that
point.
It is understood that the establishment
of other bases and new lines of
communication were talked of. but the
details of the fighting at Parral and
the abrupt halt in operations that came
as a result were discussed at length.
Gen. Pershing's reports, which are
said to contain recommendations that
radical changes be authorized, probably
will be gone over carefully today.
High army officials here remained almost
indifferent to the suggestions that
the manifest hostility of Carranza's
troops might be due to work by agents
of Felix Diaz, or those of any other aspiring
enemy of the de facto government.
Department of Justice agents
have failed to discover any tangible
evidence that Diaz is making headway
along the frontier, and all reports to
army headquarters indicate that the
officers of Carranza garrisons who are
showing so marked an antagonism toward
the Americans .are wholly loyal
to the first chief.'
Troops Ready to Move.
EL PASO. Tex.. April 22.-Brig. Gen.
Pershing has made such disposition of
nis rorces mat tne American punitive
expedition is equally ready today to
proceed quickly in pursuit of Villa or
withdraw from Mexico when the future
course of ojierationp is determined
by the administration at Washing-ton.
The troops can be retired from Mexico
in ten days, according to army officer?
at Fort Rliss.
Carranza officials at Juarez reported
the situation generally quiet throughout
upper Mexico, and said every preparation
has been made to suppress any
disorders that might arise. The Parral
district is being filled with Carranza
troops and guards have been thrown
about mining properties.
Carranza Troops Moving.
A troop train left Juarez today with
several hundred members of the Juares
garrison on board who have been ordered
to 4'asas Grandes. According to
Mexican officials, these troops are not
ritendecl as a reinforcement of the <'asas
irandes garrison, but will replace the
soldieis now there, who will be sent
o Madera.
{'ending the report which Gen. Scott
s expected to make to the War Department
toda> from San Antonio and
>n which a decision will be reached as
o whether or not the expeditionary
'nice shall be withdrawn from Mexico,
here was a lull even in the ranks or
.he alarmists on the border.
Villa has become a minor figure in
lie situation as far as Kl Paso is con:erned..
Those who do not believe he
s dead are willing to admit that his
prestige ts gone and that he has
eased to be a factor in Mexican af'airs.
