WILL H. THOMPSON, attorney,
civil war veteran and student of
diplomacy: "I thoroly approve of
President Wilson's action. I think
the patience of the president thus

unprepared condition of the I nlted
States, and that he thought It bet

United Press Staff Correspondent
WASHINGTON, April 22.—Little hope that Germany
will meet fully the American submarine demands is apparent
here today..
The interview which Carl \V. Ackerman. United Press
staff correspondent, obtained with Admiral Von Holtzendorff
furnished, the state department with its first definite line on
the German attitude.
Some officials concluded that modification of Wilson's de
mand* would be the only chance of avoiding a break, and modi*
fication is out of the question, they said.
The administration is leaving Germany to decide whether
she can conduct her submarine operations effectively without
violating international law.
I.ansing feel- that if German submarine commanders wit
and search vessels before attacking them, and assure the
safetv of passengers on doomed ships, the campaign will be
robbed of it- destructiveness and hence of its effectiveness.
If (iermatiy agrees to follow the visit, search and safety
of passengers provision. America may accept her assurances,
but Germany must adhere to its pledges.
The problem then is: Will Germany abandon her present
method of submarining, which must be the first step towxf&
a policv healing strained relations with the United States.
The authorities feel that Admiral Yon Holtzendorff in the
Ackerman interview indicated Germany's unwillingness to
1 meet the demands, but desired to shift responsibility for a
pos-ible break to America.
President Wilson will confer with Sen.. Stone on general
j international affairs at S p. 111 Monday, it was learned today.
