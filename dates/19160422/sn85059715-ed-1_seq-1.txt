SAN ANTONIO, April 22?Secretary
of War Raker should be in receipt
of u report before night from
Major General Hugh L. Scot! that
may assist the administration in deciding
whether to withdraw the
American troops or send them farther
Into Mexico. Generals Scott and
Fupst'on today will review in detail
I the history of the punitive expedition's
operations since entering Mexico
almost six weeks ago.
Carranza oillcials have given
plausible reasons for moving the
forces of General Gomez eastward
from Sonora. the troops of General
Luis Herrerra south from Chihuahua
to Tarral, and a considerable force
towards Casas Grandes. but should
the war ollice at Mexico City decide
further American military opera-:
tioQP, General Pershin will be prepared
for any situation.
It is understood that the establishment
of other bases and new lines of
communication were talked of but the ,
! details of the fighting at Parral and;
the abrupt halt in operations that '
came as a result were discussed at.
length.
' General Pershing's reports, which j
I are said to contain recommendations
i that radical changes be authorized,
probably will be gone over carefully
today.
Overnight despatches from the front
indicated no renewed offensive activity.!

Truths
Insurance
i n .J- ?i
lt c r* rvscntea
the companies, life insurance! The]
companies are but the machinery,
through which life Insurance, the',
science, the co-operation, does its work
for mankind. The best that can be;
said for your company or for mine is !
that it worthily embodies the truths j
and ideals of life insurance. Out any 1
two companies, like any two saints,;
exhibit two differing blends of the car- i
dinal virtues. We have to look above i
aud beyond all the companies and their '
various blends, if we want a distinct, i
complete picture of any one or all of j
those cardinal truths common to us all. <
What is l?fe Insurance, fundamentally?
It is first of all a science; an
applied natural science; the application
of nature's great law of mortality. ]
Its advance calculations, like those of!
astronomy, haVe been tested and proven
throughout 150 years. That science i
gives us an advance schedule of the
maximum number of deaths that will I
occur In a large group year by year
to the end. The closest parallel Is an I
Issue of serial bonds; a known number
of them to be called each year; '
which particular ones not known until |
singled out each year^by lot. Fore- j
known payments call, of course, for a
sinking fund. That reserve fund,
scientifically figured, compounding
year by year, belongs to all the outstanding
policies; each has a yearly
increasing share in it. This Is why
every life policy is a lifetime sinking
fund operation; why a man's premium,
or deposit. Is not money spent hut
saved- Thn Roinnro rnolrno W on T?
mokes "life Insurance" unavoidably I
spell thrift."
That science and the state laws I
based on It definitely set apart and 1
protect eighty-four per cent of the en- i
tire assets In this policy reserve. They j
also dominate the daily transactions, i
leaving practically no room for tho [
fatal errors of judgment by which
other business falls. That science ls|
Impersonal, Impartial, the "square
deal" Incarnate. It makes the well
established company stronger than
other financial Institutions, not mereas
a bigger thing of the same kind,
but as having also another and higher
kind of strength?the strength of nature's
law out of which ItB whole
structure Is fashioned as the skyscraper
Is fashioned of steel. This
scientific stability sets all such companies
together on a table-rock ot
granite, towering above all else In
the financial and business world.
A life insurance, fundamentally, Is
also a co-operation. It belongs to
the policy-holders. First, because
they, not the company, make it. The
'Ives actually Insure each other, and
do bo almost wholly with their own
money. The company (whether mutual
or stock) Is but the central bureau
through which they operate. The
policy-holders are the bees, their reserve
fund the honeycomb, the company
the hive?and when, as It
sometimes happens, a re-Insurance
deal transfers the bees honevcomb
and all, to another hive, there Is
where the honey making goes on.
Then it is plain enough that the hive
itself never made any honey. The|
policy-holders moreover, own nearly,
all the assets and profits. Over nine-.
ty-seven per cent of each, taking all |

m w "**
' ': ''' '' ,; -* ' '
aphs of the expeditionary force in Mexii
Washington that in case th? crisis with
of Villa will be recalled. These photog
ring their horses while jesting in the int
force practicing with trie rangeflndcr on
the companies together. They are!
the actual owners in luw and in fact; j
the cpnipany management (whether)
mutual or stock) is hut their trustee
to collect, invest and distribute.
This life Insurance is not at all to i
bp classed with the usual private,!'
proprietary business, existing to make
money out of its customers. It exists
to save and earn money for Its
customers, who are also its sole or
chief owners. That is why its contracts
are so liberal and its practices
even more so. As a true co-operaly
and want it now?the kind that
tion life insurance is to be classed
with the mutual savings bank or the
building and loan association; it is a
great deal more like one's church,
lodge or club, than like one's grocer
or gas company. Its business organization
and agency forces are necessary
to its efficient operation; they
are its brains and hands, hut they are
in no sense its body and soul. It is
a co-operation of policy-holders that
its bPlng.life insurance lives ana
has its being.
This again means strength, permanence,
stability. The single company 1
numbers its members by the thousands,
enlisted for life. Far greater 1
than the strengtli of great assets Is 1
the strength of great numbers of
men. This is living .growing strength;
its keeps creating more values. It
is the distinctive strength of "municipals"
which because of it lead the
list of investment bonds. It'Is, in
Darwin P. Kingsley's tine phrase, "the
immeasurable strength of men standing
together."
These are some of the big fundamental
truths?common to all of us,
but not possessed by other business
?that the New System must voice to
prospects and people generally Must
voice, not merely because they are
true, but also because they are effective;
far more effective than any
one-company "sales-talk" can be.
The New Soliciting, therefore, is
soliciting that grounds the prospect's
confidence in all our propositions on
a few fundamental facts and truths
common to us all, and thus leaves the
bulk of the time free to tell him <
plainly the things that interest and
attract him.
It is soliciting that has no time to
tight over the one immediate "prospect"?both
because the fight (however
it ends) will yield him a poorer ,
future prospects and booster; and because
very many more people are
waiting around the corner to be rightly
solicited without any'flghtIt
is soliciting that is creative, not
competitive; with talk that is Institutional,
rather than "one-company";
by rightly trained, permanent
agents, working for their own and
their prospects' future with all the
resources of skilled salesmanship,
plus professional counsel, plus appostolic
vision and zeal.
It Is In a word efficient soliciting
?the kind that makes the prospect 1
want life Insurance, want it large- 1
ly, and whant It now?the kind that
will open the eyes of the wholi pub- !
lie to Its need for life insurance, and '
open those eyes far wider than has j
ever seemed possible to it or to us. j

there was no disorder. Organization

leaders of the strike announced
they would organize a parade at noon
to visit the other townB In the Tur.
tie Creek valley, In an attempt to
bring out workmen In a number of
factories which do not recognize the

say, they would have 28,000 men

Later the company announced that
the shops were practically closed and
added that the grievance committee, '
which heretofore had conducted all
negotiations for the men. had made
no demands and that the company,
was in Ignorance, officially, as to what IKfl
the strike was for. Recently an ndvance
