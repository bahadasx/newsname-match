jj Disquieting Signs
A PRESIDENT WILSON
has been under the
h arc light for four years.
' He has had every op-
t' portunity to demon
strate whether or not
L he is indeed a great
man and statesman;
f one of those who some-
time seems to be called
y
t! to take the helm when
'" the Ship of State is
laboring in confused
iu seas, under stormy
skies and the ominous
I roar of breakers is
I heard between the as-
f saults of the gale. When
ho took his great office
he had the good wishes
(of all his countrymen.
When President Lin-
coin was first elected
I the people in the cen-
f ters where the dense
t population of the na-
tion dwelt were disap-
fc pointed sorely.
There were so many
great names to choose
from; so many men
who had proved their
" scholarship and states-
manship and wisdom.
To ignore them all
!' and pick up this un
known, unlearned, un
s couth man and make
him President when a
i , . mighty war was immi
nent, seemed to their
provincial souls almost
as though the Provi
I dence that, from the
m first, had brooded our
! nation under protecting
wings, had deserted us.
The tone of their pray
ers was almost an ap
peal for protection not
withstanding the rais
in take that Providence,
while napping, had per
mitted to be made.
Inauguration day came
and with it the Presi
dent's brief speech.
K So darkened were
their eyes that thou
' sands could not analyze
that speech and see
i that not one of their
"great" men could
have framed it. Then
came the war and its
abuse of the man who
W was Chief Magistrate.

4S HE child of James and Mary Edith Kelly Glass, Bishop Glass was born at Bushnell, II
g (T linois, March 13, 1874.
J Before he reached school age, his parents removed to Sedalia, Mo., there for sev-
eral years he attended the parochial schools. Then his home being changed to Los An
geles, Cal., he entered St. Vincent college there in 1887, where he remained four years; then re
turned to his old home and pursued his studies in St. Mary's Apostolic college at Perryville, Missouri,
for two years. His course of study completed there, he in 1891 entered the novitiate of tho Congre
gation of the Mission, and from there became a student of St. Mary's seminary in Perry county, in
which institution he completed his course in philosophy of theology.
He was ordained a priest by Bishop George Montgomery in St. Vincent's church, Los Angeles,
Cal., August 15, 1897.
After finishing his education in the United States he went to Rome, where, with its predomin
ant religious atmosphere and its connections with the historical Catholic church and monuments
of ancient and Christian Rome, he became a student of philosophy and theology. He attended the
University of the Propoganda, and the University of the Minerva and graduated in 1899 with the
degree of D. D. ,
(Continued on Page 14.)
He was pursued by H
cartoons and all the H
vindictiveness of a cop- H
perhead press at home, H
and with equal mean- IH
ness by the press and jH
statesmen of England iH
and France, and the jH
leading press of his iH
own party felt it a duty H
to become his morning H
and evening advisers. H
Tho north, all unac- H
customed, even in pri- H
vate quarrels, to resort H
to weapons, was at first H
unsuccessful in the H
field, but the President H
kept his hand steady H
upon the helm; he saw H
what official communi- H
cations were sent H
abroad, when a deter- H
mined attempt was H
mado and continued to H
dismiss and disgrace H
General Grant he de- H
feated it because he H
said, "that man fights;" H
only once did he stoop
to squelch an insolent H
fault-finder. That was
when Carl Schurz wrote H
him a captious letter H
assailing his manage- H
ment of the war. Then H
Mr. Lincoln bent down
and replied to that let- M
ter and there was nbth- H
ing left of Schurz. More H
lank and care-seamed H
grew tho patient man H
and the time came M
when a President had M
to again be nominated. M
And lo! No one save M
Mr. Lincoln was seri- M
ously thought of for the M
place by his own party. M
Tho soul of the man M
had begun to shine out M
through the uncouth jl
tabernacle; the people M
had begun to see that M
Providence had not M
been napping four M
years before, but that jH
its ways "are true and JH
righteous altogether." iH
To obtain the second (H
nomination Mr. Lincoln 'H
did not tell what had M
been accomplished un- H
der his administration, ;H
never once claimed that )H
he was without person- !H
al ambition, but merely 'H
said he should like "to ;H
finish the work on H
hand." - H
