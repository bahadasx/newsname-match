LOYAL WEST FEL ANA
STAMPS THE ROOSTER
The result of Tuesday's election in
West relicrana justilled the pre.electlion,
claims of the ietnb rats, who had
figured ot ~a majority of thtrt) votes,
and was a distinct disappointotmt.t to
the Progressives, who had also figured
on Carry llg the Parish.
The fact that John M. Parker, the
Progreslive candidate for governor,.
received the flattering vote cast for
bhim in West Peliclana cannot be con
strued that any considerable number
of West eliciran eiltitens are in sym
pathy with him In hise epubllean Pro
gresaive ideas. as the registered Pro'
resrrive vote in the pariah I neglllliible. !
The West 'ellclana Parker vote wasi
a tribute to the personality of the man.
Mr. Parker has been long and favor
ably known to many of our rtlisens
lHe has recently acquired a large plan.
tatlleon In the parish, and many voted
for him as neighbor and friend. Then,
too, the sting of defeat in the primary
caused some to go to the enemies of
i)emocracy for consolation.
These are the reasons why the Pro
gressives got as large a vote as they
did in West ielctana. These are,
possialbly, the same grounds upon which
they based their calculation of carry
ing the parish for Parker.
There is little use in attempting toI
analyse the vote in the parish The
tabulated returns speak for themselves.
Two incidents concerning the elc.'
tion in the parish give a little variety
to the utews. Mr. Parker received 2e
votes in the 10th ward, But three of
these were east on the Progressive'
ticket. The other seventeen were cast
on the independent ticket and recorded
on the compiled statement as "Inde
pendent Democrats." in Bayou nara,
a factional scrap for constable causled
ten men, who stamped the rooster, to
lose their votes.

MI WINS IN CITY ANO IDOUNTRY
IN LARGEST VOTE POLLED IN TWENTY YEAI
The largest vote in Loulsiana since
the negro was disfranchised was cast
in Tuesdays" election, in which (ol.
I Rumn (. Pleasant, ID.emocrat, defeated
John M Parkrr, Progressive, for gou
ernor by a lead approximating 30,000.
('ol. Pleasant carried both New Orleans
and the country parishes by substan-.
tial majorities. Just as het did in the
primary.
Hut one congressional district is
placed in the Progressive column, that
being the third, as was expected. The
estimated Parker majority in this dis
trict was 6,400 but the returns gave
only a 4,000 majority. Even the "solid
third" was broken, St. Martin staying
lemocratic by 21 votrs.
t)utside the third district and a few
of the other parishes in the sugar dim.
trict it was a walkover for ,he Iemo
crrats. oasted majorities for Parker
In the larger cities, such as Shreve
port, Baton Rouge, lake Charlea and
Alexandria failed to materialize.
At the time this is printed the vote
stands. Pleasant 72.943; Parker 47.164;
total. 12],107 ;Pleasant majority, 21,871.
It is estimated that there are at least
10.0H41 votes yet to hear from, which
will probably place Pleasant's majority
in the neighborhood of 30.000).
The vote for lieutenant (Governor is
slightly lower than that for Governor.
though Mouton, Democrat, wins over
Broussard, Progrleslve, by about the
same percentage that Pleasant wins.
('ol. Pleasant returned to his home
at Shreveport to vote, remaining over
Wednesday to rec*i'e the congratula
tions of his friends and neighbors. On
Wednesday morning Mr. Parker sent
the following telegramt "Permit me to
congratulate you on your election as
governor of lonlsiana. and to sincerely
wish for your administration the suc
cessful acomntpllshment of those 14ws
and reforms so essential to the pros
perity of this state."
Mr. Parker, accompanied by Mrs.
Parker and their daughter, carme up to
St. Praneilville, Thursday morning. for
a rest after a rather strenuous cam
paign.

was that Hlenator statord of New

ship has not been determined, though
it looks as though it will go to the
sixth district, the two candidates from
that section apparently having a lead
over the field. Representative ilewitt
Ilouanchaud of Point ('oupe has long
been an aspirant for that honor. His
parlah went for Parker. but the ma.
jorlit was so small that his friends
claim it will not interfere with his
race ('ol T, Sambola Jones also
aspires to the speakership. He did
exce'llent work for the party during
the campaign and has a large following.

and allow a drop of blood from the
carcass (just after or within an hour
after death) to fall on a piece of clean

Now that the political elections are u

The people have responded generously e
in the way of voluntary contributions,
It is desirable that every person in the
parish make some contribution to the y
financial success of the Fair. if you
can give only $1.00, don't hesitate to
send in the pledge. We would rather
have 100 one dollar contributions than
,ave the whole amount donated by one
person, because in the former case we
would have one hundred "boosters"
Instead of one.
Just put your name down on a postal a

lit ROOSTER CROWED
I AST TUESDAY NIGH
i, Tuesday night. April It, was Rooster
p Night in St Francisvlle. It. I. A, and
both the feathered and whiskered
members of the tribe lent full seet to
The occasion.
I At 9 o'clock. recognising that Di
Snmocracy was triumphant by some steen
thousands, a man wearing, among other
i things, a Texas ranger hat, and amok.
r ug a corn-cob pipe, got a good old
Democratic rooster crow out of his
Ssystem, somewhere between The True
I)emocrat omce and the court house
where the election returns were being
received. John Wilrox's big red rooster
did not hesltate an Instant, but took up
the refrain lustily. The smiling men
at the court )ouse joined In and rooster
crows were the rule rather thin the
exception for the balance of the night
and far Into Wednesday. The crowing
of the men seemed to excite the feath'
ered tribe, and every time a man would
crow he would be answered by a chorus
from his barnyard friends.
After becoming accustomed to the
Innovation it became easy for one to
tell from where the sounds came. In
fact. by taking into consideration the
location and the note of exultation, or
the lack of It. It was as easy as failing
off a log to tell whose rooster was
making the noise The firal rooster up
the Woodville road couldn't make much
of a noise and gave evidence that he
had been in a pretty hard scrap, that
wsa Willie Howell's rooster and t'ol
fort had been after him all day. A
territtlle cackling set up farther on up
the road. No mistaking that noise; it
was ('harlie Argue's bird The loudest
noise. although it had a long distance
to come,. wa: from the fifth ward. No
hesitation her.', either. as it was im
midlately rece.ni.red as t'ncle Hobble
Thom's rooster. Prom the east came
a faint cackle ('heston Folkes' fowl
Dave Norwood was in town and said
Ihe noisoe from the eighth ward csane
from Bennett Harrow's direction. Prom
up the river came a lusty crow and Hill
I)avideon said It was from a bird that
sas too swift for him Then from
the seventh ward a terrific clatter set
'up. Rome Democrat started to tell
whose rooster It was when Oeorge
1l.'ttinger cut in sith "Aw. that chick
en is in a cage up at ('ap'n Whittaker's

But it wa r~oate.r night. and don't
you forget it.
COMMUNITY CO-OPEIATION.
(Farm and Ranch i
I have always contended that a town
or a community is just what the people
who live In It choose to make it.
A small town that I visited not long
ago serves as a splendid basis of proof
of my contention
Plva years ago thin town looked
delispidated run down at the heel To.
day it Is attractive In every way. and
the change was brought about through
properly directed community effort
under the leadership of a few wide
aswake sWomen. who determined to
ma) their neighborhood more at
tractlve and consequently more pleas
mat to live in
One of the women stated to me most
emphatically that the greatest obstacle
they had to overcrome was "outoftowa
buylng " She further stated that do
sired resaultse could not he Igotten until
the people were In the main induced to
spend heir moneny in the local stores.
ffectlve work of this kind can bhe
done in any community and every one
taking part will share in the good
aecompsllhed.
