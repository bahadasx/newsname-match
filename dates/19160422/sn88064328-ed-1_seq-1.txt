IN
ACQUITTED
In this thrilling TRIANGLE PLAY Wilfred Lucas
fights for his life. It's a hard struggle from start to finish
and the many gripping sern^s almost compel you to rush to
his rescue, but in the end innocence wins and the man is
vindicated.
You have heard many tales of the horrors of the aw
ful police third degree. This play gives you a vivid picture
of the terrible experiences of an innocent man.

BRYAN IN LEAD TO AVERT
WAR WITH GERMANY.
Washington, Aprâl 20.—While
the I nitcd States waits for Ger-are
to reply to the note <Ie
ment of present methods of con
'ducting su lunar n ■ warlaie, one
of the chief sources of concern
here is the possibility of another
attack on a peaceful ship carry
i11<r Americans before the Herlin
government has determined upon
its course. In such an event it is
admitted that an immediate rup
tnre could be prevented only by
proof that Germany had been
unable to communicate with her
submarine commanders.
I ii explaining the demand of
the United States today o.licials
said that, while abandonment ol
the present m-thods at once was
essential to the continuance of
diplomatic relations, the United
States might agree to German
submarine operations under the
restrictions of cruiser warfare. It
was emphatically reiterated, how
ever, that a discission of thai
phase would not be entered into
until the present campaign was
brought to a stop. The I'nited
States stands firm in its detenu
nation not to tolerate the unlaw
tul and inhuman sinking of
another ship.
Von Bemstorff
Meets Lansing.
The ambassador called at the
state department today and had
a twenty-five minute conference
with Secretary Lansing.
Lansing listened with much iiN
tercst to the suggestions made 'by
Count von Mernstoru, which he
understood the ambassador was
ready to make to his government
for its guidance in framing a re
ply to t lie American note. The
secretary, however, was not dis
posed to accept the views ex
pressed by the ambassador as be
in g official. Ile was described «au
thoritatively as being inclined to
regard them as the ambassador's
'owVflpffifort'/Und informative M
the latter's desire to prevent a
break between his country and
the United States. The presi
dent having laid down the condi
tion that there must be an
abandonment of the present sub
marine methods, Secretary Laus
ing takes the view that there must
a direct and formal response
from the German government it
js -lf before there can be a discus-j
sion of the various phases of the |
subject or of any alternative
propositions sliprt of absolute!
compliance with the American j
demands.
Another Message
Sent to Berlin.
As a result of his
Count von Bernstorff sent another
communication to Mis govern-jit
ment this evening. It was
clear at the German embassy later
that the ambassador did not ex
jpect to call upon Secretary Lans
again untii after his govern
jment had made a formal reply
]to the American note.
Just how long the
United
States is willing to wait for the
German reply has not been dis
closed. 'All officials agree that
"a reasonable" time will be al-,
lowed. Press dispatches an
nouncing that the note had ar
rived in Herlin were read with
much interest, hut official word
of the delivery of the communi
cation had not been received fiom
Ambassador Gdrard.

DEPENDS ON THE MAN.
i Many men think they have

"in the wrong town.' As a
rule, however, the trouble is not
with the town. These two little
true stories, borrowed from the
Iron Tradesman of Atlanta, are to
the point:
An Indiana man went broke as

He came south with his family,
a wife and several children and
1200 in money, his total remain

35,000 lie decided to try a market
garden, lie went to a local
anker for advice. The banker
commended his purpose, and told
iij m that he owned live acres on
a rocky hillside in the edge of
town which was mighty poor land,
but if he could use it he could
take it for +<>00, pay for it when
he got ready, and Use his little
capital to bùild u house and buy
a horse and wagon.

possibilities, and, though warned

CITY AND COUNTRY.
Speaking befoie the great mass
meeting at the Athenaeum which
marked the culmination of ^ his
primary campaign, Gov .-Elect
Pleasant said if he were elected
and dnring his administration
succeeded in bringing the country
and city into harmonious rela-,
tions in politics and business he
would feel he had rendeicd a^
sreat. service to his State.
He was nominated by an over
welming majority in both sections
and it seemed as if the sectional
issue had been laid to rest. But
it was seized upon again by the
Republican-Progressive candidate
'and his newspapers and attempted
«® b « """ 1e lh " dominatinir '<»
tnre of the general campaign.
Mr. Parker did not expeet to win
by the catch-penny économie prop
ositions he lightlv touched in his
addresses; his real hope was to
array the country against the
city organization.
The country, however, has re
turned the same answer it did in
the primary. It has beaten Mr.
Parker twice as badly as the city
defeated him ; and Gov.-Elect
Pleasant will take the oath of of
fice on May 15 as the choice of
both sections.
May we not hope that the oc
casion will mark the final inter

nient of the country vs. the cay
issue? Loi\isiana has suffered
previously by the constant effort
to array the two sections against
each other; and the campaign
falsely to picture the city in the
grip of a political ring has ha<i
its effect in imineasiira-ile 'busi
ness injury. The outgoing ad
ministrât ion has done not a liilie
to abet this sectional ill-feeling.
There is no reason why i,>
inaiigi ration o| the new admin s
trat ion should not coiiespond
with the turning over oi a new
leaf iu the relations between t lie
two sections. \\ e ought to have
an end to unnecessary political dis
cu: sion. We ought to have an
agreement oil the part of all
classes in the city and country t• >
accept the decision of the late
election in its true spirit. There
ouuht to be a common effort to
aid Gov. Pleasant in uniting ail
Louisianians behind his plans to
solve the serious problems which
confront the State.
The next four years ought to
record an epoch in the history of
the State. We have had seven
months of bitter political con
troversy and two heated elections
TJie fairings of ueith^' election

in each case has been decisive.
Why not soft-pedal polities for
three years and a half and turn
to business, recognizing that the
interests of the city and country
are mutual and that the people
of one section are as patriotic, as
honest aijd as devoted to the up
building of Louisiana - as the
other?—States.
