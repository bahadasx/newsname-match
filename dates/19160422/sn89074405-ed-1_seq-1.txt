RURAL CREDIT BILL
TAKES PRECEDENCE
Washington, April 22.—After three
days' debate on the Bankhead good
toads bill, the senate adjourned late
yesterday without reaching a vote
and under the recently adopted leg
islative program,, the measure now

be used with an equal amount con
tributed by the- states for road build
ing, tried unsuccessfully to get unan
imous consent to a vote on his meas
ure. Senator Liodge refused the nec
essary consent.
During the debate, Senator Hard
ing obtained the adoption of an
amendment which would require the
states to guarantee to maintain the
roads built by federal aid for a pe
riod of ten years. Senator Smoot of
fered as a substitute for the Bank
head bill—Itself a substitute for the
Bhackleford bill passed by the house

so-called Bourne bill which
would provide for the federal govern
ment extending its credit to the states
for ®fty years to the extent of $600,
000,000 for road building purposes.

POLICE MUST
BRING WITNESS
New York, April 22.—Difficulty was
experienced by the police yesterday in
framing a charge on which a magis
trate would consent to hold Harry L.
Newton, the former munitions worker,
arrested yesterday, who is alleged to
have agreed with detectives to blow
up munitions plants in Dunkirk and
Canada. After three corpplaints had
been discarded by the -TTlfin'raftrr
Newton, finally was held on a charge
of tiaving conspired- with Herry
Stenif a detective, up^jhe
Federal building- in tfili
magistrate held Nettrton'in $6,000 ball
and gave the police until today to
produce Stenif to substantiate the
charge.
Newton was first exonerated on a
charge of bringing explosives from
Canada to this city. His attorney said
the only thing resembling an explo
sive that Newton had was an empty,
defective shell he had bought in Can
ada and brought to Buffalo to present
to his sweetheart.
Detective Barnitz. who made the
arrest, then offered an affadvit
charging Newton with having a bomb
in his possession in Buffalo. The
magistrate refused to entertain the
complaint and told Barnitz he would
have to do better if he wished to have
Newton held. A charge of conspiracy
was likewise thrown out, when Barnitz,
replying to a question from the court,
said that Newton "conspired with
himself."
After a delay of several hours, an
affladvlt that Newton had conspired
with Stempf was presented and ac
cepted until tomorrow.
