ADMITS GERMANY MAY

Insists On Right To Hit En

By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Berlin, April 22. "We insist ou our
riyht to hit our foes In their weake-t
spot. Nevertheless, we want peace with
the grout people across the water j,i.-t
as we have not wanted war with "ou"
present foes."
This was the editorial statement of
the Lokul An.oiger, which elaims to
have the largest circulation in tier
many, in discussing the submarine is
nue. "An agreement with the I'nitc!
States should be possible," it contin
ued. "We have emphasized that it is
possible we have overstepped our rig!".t
to safeguard our vital interests ami
honor. However, wo reserve the right
to state our viewpoint when we have
exact knowledge of the note."
The text of the note has not yet beer
published here.
Foreign Minister Von Jagow asked
Ambassador (lerard not to inform Am
ericans here of its contents until Ja

The l.okal Auzeiger said it was p.is

All Depends on Germany.
By Robert J. Bender.
i I'nited Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, April 22. There is lit
tle hope in Washington that Germany
will meet fully the, American submarine
demands. That was apparent today.
The interview which Carl W. Acker
man, I'nited Tress stff correspondent,
obtained with Admiral Von lloltzen
di.rff furnished the state department
with its first definite line on the Gor
man attitude. Some officials concluded
that modification of Wilson's demands
would be the only chance of avoiding
a break mid modification is out of the
question, they said.
The administration is leaving Oer
Jiiany to decide whether she can concfuet
her submarine operations effectively
without violutitng international law.
Secretary Lansing feels that if (lermaa
submarine commanders visit mid search
vessels before attacking them, aio as
sure the safety of passengers on doom
ed ships, the campaign will be robbed
of its dostruotivouesj and hence of its
effectiveness.
If (formally ngrees to 'follow the visit,
search and safety of passengers pro
visions America may nefept her assur
roves, but Germany' must adhere to its
pledges. The problem there is: Will
G.-nunny abandon her present method
of submarining which imi-t be the first
step toward a policy healing strained
relations with the I'iiited States.

NO EASTER GIFTS
FOR GERMAN TROOPS
TOMORROW
Berlin, April 22. In order to
prevent the loading down of
the army mails with Faster
gifts this year, the German
military authorities have caused
notice to be published in the
press reminding the soldiers'
relatives and friends that such
things will not tie forwarded.
The notice also informs the peo
ple that, with all due recogni
tion of the spirit of good-will
prompting these girts, the send
ing of articles thur easily spoil,
such as eggs, sausages, etc.,
would not be in accordance with
the strict economy demanded, by
the present state of affairs.
Vcn Igefs Papers, If He Is An
Official, Place Germany
In Bad Light
Washington, April 22. The German
embassy expects to receive today or to
morrow instructions from Berlin with
regard to additional representations
concerning the arrest of Wolf Von Igel,
former secretary to Captain Franz on
Papon, embassy attache, and seizure of
his papers by United States secret
agents.
The embassy intimated that this situ
ation is so serious that it may perhaps
warrant Germany recalling Ambassador
Von Bcrnstorff. Germany, it was Ilia"
ed, would at least ask a formal apology
from the state department.
The papers seized from Von Igel ar
rived at Washington today. No photo
graphic copies of them were surrender
ed, however. The latter he L'li'ted
States marshal refused to ;iv; un wi'h
out a specific order to return ull evi
dence in the case. No sr.-k order has
boon issued yet.
Von Igel was arrested in connection
with the federal investigation 1' alleged
German bomb plots.
YALE WON JUNIOR EIGHT
Philadelphia, April 22. Yale this af
ternoon won the junior varsity eight
boat rrtce from the I'niversity of
Pennsylvania by half a length.'
icaus are preparing to close their af
fairs and leave Germany on two days'
notice if diplomatic relations with the
I'nited States are severed, it is kuowu
today. A number have arranged to
come to Holland and leave their affairs
in neutral hands in Berlin. Others,
however, intend to remain in Germauy
even though relutions be severed, feci
ing confident that war will not result.
There has been no exodus of Amei
icans since the latest submarine crisis
developed. Several Americans here post
poned going to Berlin pending the out
come of the recent events. About SOU
Americana are in Germany. Those
leaving would probably concentrate in
Berlin and go to Holland on a special
train.
German-American excitement is up
parently subsiding. The feeling is grow
ing that Germauy will either yield im
mediately or maneuver to prevent aa
edy rupture in diplomatic relations.
AUSTRIA FAVORS YIELDING
Pome, April 22. Austria will
exert pressure on Germany to
prevent a break with the I'nited
States, it was learned from neu
tral diplomats today rather than
have a severance of diplomatic
relations. Austria's influence,
it is declared, caused Germany's
"back down'' in the Ancuua
case.

Namiquipa, Mex., by wireless to Coi

receipt of one of the numerous re
ports that Villistn bands were in the
neighborhood, American cavalrymen
found a warm camp believed to be thu
of General Cervantes and 80 or 100 men.
They captured four V nMstos and a num

Parral clash, increased animosity to
Americans is evident, among the na
tives. Menace Not Removed.
By H. D. Jacobs.
(United Press staff correspondent.;
Namiquipa, Mex., April 22 (By wire
less to Columbus.) The menace frora
Francisco Villa and his bandits is no:
believed to have been removed by ihe
American expedition's operations.
Hardly a day passes that small bands
are not sighted and reported. Within
narrowed limits since the Parral clash
the quest for Villa continues.
Many wild and contradictory stories
have been received. Some say VilU js
dead and some say he is alive. T!i
report that he is dead and that his bsdy
will be brought from somewhere in Mex
ico over the Mexican Northwestern rn'l
way for identification is not credited.
While there is no news of the Par
ral situation, no concern is felt for the
position of advanced detuchments near
est the scene of the suspected Cnrruu
zista trap.
The jagged defiles and canyons in
this region are ideal hiding places fo"
the Villistas. A band can remain un
discovered until reconnoitering parties
fairly stumble upon them.
But the Villistas have evidently had
their fill of American marksmanship
in the two or three clashes w hich hav
occurred already, and they keep out of
harm's wav.
ARGUMENT NOT BATIiIED
Washington, April 22. The bill to
ratify the agreement between the
Washington ami Oregon fishery laws
ou the Columbia river was practically
hilled today when thp senate fisheries
committee deadlocked on it, the voto
resulting i" a lie.
I b'e olulionists stationed in America
were reported active despite the oper
ations of the United States secret sor-
'vice. The revolutionary movement of
Felix Diaz is believed to be the most
foniiicl.ible. lie apparently has unlim
ited backing, and is awaiting the
- American expedition withdrawal.
It was reported that both Carrana
and Din:', had used Gorman money.
Charges that Germ ins inspired the Vil
listn raid, on Columbus brought from
Consul Garcia .i statement that he had
heard reports that Germans financed
Villa to cause a war between the Unit
ed St.ites and Mexico so that America
nvouhl keep out of the Luropcau con
llict. Ua'cia said Mexican secret ser
vice agents were investigating this.
The rumors are not confirmed.
Villa has apparently escaped from
danger of immediate rapture. If he
has not re t' hed Southern Mexico by
this time it is because he preferred to
,stay within tantalizing distance of the
I expedition.

"PEACE BE WITH YOU'
New York, April 22. The

United States was cabled from
Porue through Cardinal Caspar

the United. Press today. It
follows:
(Copyright 1910, by the United

"The I'nited Press, New

These sweet words which the

presently, laying down the

Prices Broke Badly In
Stock Market Today
New York, April 22. The New York
Kvening Sun's financial review today
said:
What had every appearance of a
carefully planned and wel( executed
bear raKf-sivaa responsible for a severe
break in prices on the stock exchange
today. The street resumed business
after the Friday intermission with the
depressing news of little or no possi
bility of a modification in Germany's
submarine iiolicy calculated to avert a
severance of diplomatic relations. Jn
addition, long continued declines and
weaki(y margined accounts weakened
the market's technical position.
First prices were lower with losses
reaching to one point or more in issues
like Studebaker Corporation, Baldwin
Before the end of the first hour re
cessions -of from two to l'ive points
were common on the specialty list.
Selling relaxed slightly toward the
end of the first hour and some prices
hardened on profit taking, but pres
sure was resumed in the closing half
session, influencing heavy liquidation.
While this was centered in industrial
specialties, munitions stocks and Mex
ican issues, is afro--,, the entire list.
The attendance wu meager and a
lack of. buying power contributed to
the success of the selling movement.
Other influences unsettling the market
wore Japan 's protest on the immigra
tion bill and the Sonorn governor's
cancellation of franchise granting con
cessions to foreigners.

T-ondon. April 22. The death
of
Field Marshal Von Der Goltz, commander-in-chief

establishment was a severe blow to
Turkey's armies, critics here said to
day. Perlin announced that he died of
spotted fever at Turkish headquarters.
He was ill ten days.
Many regarded him as Germany's
greatest soldier, despite the reverses
the Turks suffered after he had recon
structed their tinny. Ho also organized
Germany's secret defenses on the Rus

Von Der Goltz personally was a bluft
