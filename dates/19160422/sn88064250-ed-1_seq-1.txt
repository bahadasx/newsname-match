PLEASANT IS VICTORIOUS BY LARGE MAJORITY
PROGRESSIVEfTICKET BURIED UNDER AVALANCHE OF VOTES
PARKER CARRIES ST.
LANDRY BY BIG VOTE
=.OGRESSIVE CANDIDATE FOR GOVERNOR RECEIVES HAND
SOME MAJORITY IN THIS PARISH
CARRYING EVERY WARD
John M. Parker, Progressive can
for governor, received a
Jiarge majority in St. Landry parish
. Tuesday last having 6i8 bal
more to his credit than his
onocratic opponent, Ruffin G.
seantL
The outcome of the election in
parish was a surprise to both
D Democrals and the Bull Moose
Ollowers; it was believed by the
Pleasant forces that Parker would
-earry St. Landry by not more than
hr undred votes, while on the
e:ther hand the Parkerites felt con
-ident that this parish would roll up
majority of over one thousand in
r of their candidate.
Eie sixth ward was the banner
rker ward, the Bull Mooser car
every precinct in that ward
a total majority exceeding
hundred votes. Eunice with
votes majority was the banner
wker precinct, with Coulee Croche
behind with 104; the second
by a large vote for Parker,
hile the third, fourth and fifth
fairly good for the Bull
eontested, which ward the Par
carried by fifteen ballots.
,t. Landry has always been call
San "Independent Parish," Jared
xdirs, being the only ward boss
te for governor for the past
rtr of a century, .to carry this
7 Parker supporters worked stren
> ly during the day, Tuesday,
=~?i1g to the cause of their stan
h bearer, getting all their sup
,8ers to the polls, while, on the
i i ler hand, the Democrats were
X ,ply as energetic, striving to re
,ce the majority to the lowest
jsble figures.
SThere were surprises on both
several polls counted by
majorities by Parkerites go
.for Parker by small votes,
'other polls, such as Coulee
,he, conceded to Parker by
u'l majorities rolling up tre
p s majorities. As a whole,
ever, the vote came in just
t half way between the figures
of the opposing parties, both sides
receiving smaller votes than an
ticipated.
The local Parker headquarter,
however, was gratified at the re
suit of Tuesday's election in this
parish, and many Parker supporter
expressed the opinion that had half
tie parishes in the state done as
well for Parker as St. Landry, the
Bull Mooser would be governor of
Louisiana.
Although other polls returned
large majorities in favor of Parker
Facquetaique claims the honor of
being the only poll in the parish
to give the regular Democrat a
goose-egg, the Bull Mooser receiv
ing 39 votes against Pleasant noth
ing.
Plaisance which poll has always
been regarded a Democratic poll
gave Pleasant his largest majority
in St. Landry parish, Parker being
beaten there by 24 votes.

SEVERAL BETS WERE MADE
ON THE OPELOUSAS POLL
Money Was Plentiful to Deeide Po
litical Arguments But Parker
ites Porve More Snuoessful
Money was plentiful on Monday
night and all day Tuesday, even
while the ballets were being countr i
ed, as a means of deciding the hot
political arguments. The Parker'
soupporters were a little more timid
about betting on the Opelousas
box, although several of them'
readily bet all they could spare.
The Pleasantites were ready at
all times to bet on the local pre
cinct. The closer it came to 7
o'clock Tuesday night the more
heated were the arguments and the
more plentiful was "that scarce
thing."
Parker people, although de
feated over the state, are smiling,
because they have won their bets
on the Opelousas box, t-he first
and on the parish, some waging
that Parker would carry St. Lan
dry by over five rundred votes.
It is understood that several hun
dred dollars changed hands on
Wednesday morning as a result of
heavy betting on the Opelousas box.
The fight was so close that both
sides were claiming the box in the
neighborhood of 25 votes-the Par
ker people were better guessers,
however, carrying the poll bp 24
votes.

COL. PLEASENT IS ELECTED
BY OVER THIRTY THOUSAND
Democratic Candidate Is Victorious Over John M.
Parker By An Overwhelming Majority
---Third District Progressive
The Democratic party is supreme in Louisiana; Wil
son's administration has been given the stamp of ap
proval by the vast majority of the voters of Louisiana.
Opposed by the strongest political individual 'outside
the DemOcratic party, Col. Ruffin G. Pleasant was suc
cessful in last Tuesday's election by a majority ranging
between thirty to thirty-five thousand votes.
As expected John M. Parker carried the third district.
He was able to receive a majority of votes in only eight
parishes outside the "rebellious third."
The rock-ribbed Democrats of the hills of North Lou
isiana rolled up overwhelming majorities in favor of their
choice, proving the contention of many years standing
that none but Democrats could carry any parish in that
portion of Louisiana.
After leaving St. Landry and Evangeline, going north,
Mr. Parker ran far behind the Democratic nominee.
Senator Fernand Mouton, of Lafayette, has defeated
Edwin S. Broussard, of Iberia. Progressive candidate for
Lieutenant Governor, by over twenty thousand votes on
the face of incomplete returns. The candidates for
Lieutenant Governor failed to receive as many votes as
their running mates.
The seventh district claimed by the Parker people
went Democratic by some five hundred votes, Pleasant
carrying Allen, Beauregard, Cameron and Calcasieu.
while Parker lead in St. Landry, Evangeline, Acadia
and Jeff Davis.
Col. Pleasant will be inaugurated Governor of Lou
isiana on May the 15th.
Carrying forty-nine of the sixty
four parishes in Louisiana Ruflin G.
Pleasant, Democrat, was elected
governor over John M. Parker, Pro
I gressive Independent, by the largest
majority ever accorded a candidate,
having what appeared to be serious
iopposition.
Mr. Pleasant carried every ton
gressional district except the third
and he received a majority of over
twenty thousand votes in the coun
try, besides eleven thousand in New
Orleans.
In North Louisiana the Parker
supporters were disappointed in
certain parishes. Several of the
parishes in the hills of North Louis
iana, which were claimed as doubt
ful. went for the Democratic nom
inee by overwhelming majorities.
Mr. Parke:, however, carried the
m ajority of the ?ice and sugar par
'i rhes, receiving a clear majority in
s 1!th and southwest Louisiana.
lThe "ixtlh and sexenth districts,
wn ih Xere conceded by both sides

Pleas~at, on y the 15th. Being
the a.l . i . nim . is choice of
the ID cairti voater of Louisiana,
and having been. elected over his
Progressive opponent by such an
overwhelming majority, thousands I
of Louisianians will gather at Ba
ton Rouge on inauguration day to
pay homage to the man who was (
elected by the largest majority ever
accorded a candidate for governor
in this state.
Contrary to the predictions of
many politicians the vote cast in
Louisiana last Tuesday was larger
than that polled on January 25th,
there being in the neighborhood of
one hundred and thirty thousand
votes cast. This is the largest vote
on record since the negroes have
been cast out of politics in this
state.
The campaign was so interesting
from the viewpoint of both parties
that all men who could possibly ar
rive at the polls, in North Louis
iana, as well as in South and South
west and Central Louisiana, voted
for their choice.

Chairman Lewis Voices Sentiments
of "True Blue" Democrats in
Predicting Pleasant Success
The Opelousas Democratic Club,
on Wednesday morning, through
Chairman Lewis, wired its congrat
ulations to the standard bearer of
the Democratic party.
"We have made a good fight,"
says the telegram to Col. R. G.
Pleasant, "we have kept the faith
against tremendous odds. Out of a
vote of seven hundred and. four
this ward Parker majority only
eighteen. Parish goes to Parker
less than six hundred."
"The faithful here send you
hearty congratulations expressing
absolute confidence in the future of
the party and your administration."

as light as they did. The fight for
Democracy here was a supreme
test, a number of old line Demo
crats having gone over to the Par
ker side, bringing along with them
hundreds of friends and admir
ers; officials did not participate in
the fight, with the exception of G.
L. Dupre and E. K. Eastham, rep
resentatives-elect, and 'seiator L. '
S. Haas, who stumped the parish:
for the Democratic standard bear,
er.
L. Austin Fontenot, defeated can
didate for lieutenant governor in
the Democratic primary, took an
active part in behalf of the nomi
nees of his party. J. G. Lawler,
secretary, John W. Lewis, presi
dent, and Henry Estorge, campaign
manager, were active during .the
campaign.
A number of other faithful Dem
ocrats who are not officeholders,
took prominent part in reducing
the Parker majority. Mr. Lewis
feels that St, Landry Democrats
have done their duty.

Opelousas Team Is Crippled by.
Absence of Two Clary B~.ys
But Eunice Deserves Credit
Eunice has had the reputaIon
during the past three years of be
ing a "one man team" but Prof.
Grilth'a boys easily showed that it
*was no longer such a team. Every,
member of the Eunice team proved
himself a crack athlete and it w;.
no surprise that Eunice won the:
meet.
The Eunice track teatm carried x
the laurels at the annual St. La.
dry school rally, which took plaee
at Wallior's park, on last Saturrai
afternoon. Washington ,however,.
is alloted lots of credit for being
able to run close second to Eunice;.
a smaller and weaker team Wash-t
ington proved the surprise of the
day and had it two more men like
the two Bailey boys the result iof
the track meet would have been en-::
tirely different.
Opelousas had a bit hard iuke,
though, in the absence of the C .rf
boys, considered the mainstays o~
the team, they having been ,ealt
to the bedside of their father. T.I
race would have been more e-
citing, however, if these two tmom
bers;,of the Opelousas team I4r i
have participated in the meet, blth
Eunice would have won outf j;ft
the same, because Eunice , had ._
well-trained and fast team, ever:
member of which was fully able ta
take care of himself.
The largest crowd that ever Wice
nessed a school rally in this ei..
gathered at Wallior's park to view
the youthful athletes in action and
the event, as a wh.ol, was consider
ed a splendid financial success, net
ting in the neighborhood of sIty
odd dollars.
