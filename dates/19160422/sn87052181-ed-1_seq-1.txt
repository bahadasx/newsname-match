OMETHING was going
to happen In Athens;
this wo knew by the
spirit of unusual activ
ity on tho streets and
In tho shops, whero
overynno seemed pre
paring for some fes
tivity. That tho event
was connected with tho
church was Indicated by tho many
temporary stands, decorated with col
ored tissue paper which ornamented
the street corners, whero wero sold
candles of every size larger and hol
low at tho end to fit over a metal point
of a many-pronged church candela
brum, and tapering to a sharp point nt
tho other end, whero they wero tied In
bunches by tholr wicks, and hung In
tho booths alternating, yellow and
white. At tho corners hung those of
Bhould bo thero to join In their most
unique celebration.
Light flashed upon us, however,
when we discovered In tho hallway of
the hotel a calendar, in largo Greek
typo, which read as follows: "March
2C, Thursday," and underneath in
small typo In French: "April 8, Holy
Thursday," showing that tho Greok
calculation Is thirteen days behind the
rest of Europo, theroforo for them
Easter had not yot arrived.
That afternoon our discovery was
confirmed as wo walked through tho
old part ot town, whero the shops are.
The counter of tho public baker, whose
shop opened to tho street, was llnod
with rows of round loaves of bread
awaiting tho ordeal of tho fiery fur
nace. Each contained flvo bright-red,
hard-boiled eggs, pressed halt-way Into
tho soft dough In tho shape of a Greek
cross; all exactly alike, but each dis
tinguished from its neighbors by a slip
of paper sticking to the dough, which
bore tho namo ot the housewife who
had kneaded It.
On Good Friday wo directed our
course by tho dome-crowned spires of
tho Russian church, whoro tho queen.
tho sister of tho czar, nnd tho Russian
minister, occupied opposlto boxes.
At tho closo ot the beautiful service,
tho responses of which were sung by
a marvelous choir of unaccompanied
male voices, tho priests brought to the
front a representation ot a tomb, hav
ing a half-draped flguro of Christ paint
ed on tho top, and tho sides covered
with rich embroidery of whlto and
gold.
Tho queen advanced, kissed tho rep
resentation of tho dead body, nnd then
the hand of tho officiating priest, from
whom sho rocelvcd a stalk of white
gillyflower, and with the Russian min
ister, who followed hor example, left
tho church. Tho others of tho audience
concluded their worship In tho same
manner, each boarlng away a floral
reminder of tho coming resurrection.
That night theso representations of
tho entombed Christ wore borno tn
solemn procession from tho flvo prin
cipal churches, attended by tho priests
In gorgeous robes, acolytes bearing
banners and colored lanterns, and fol
lowed by tho mcmbors of tho parish,
each carrying a lighted candle.
At Intervals, tho procession halted
and a service wns held; then each con
gregation returned to Its own church,
and long after all was still. In Athens,
tho flickering lights of the priests of
tho Church of SL Georgo could bo seen
winding up tho zigzag path to their
sanctuary on tho top ot Lykabcttos,
tho pointed hill which rises abruptly
from tho heart of Athens.
With tho enshrining of Christ's body
In tho tomb on Friday a fast was bo
gun, lasting until tho morning ot his
resurrection. Therefore, Saturday was
quietly spent until an hour or bo be
fore midnight, when streams of peo
ple, each person bearing a lighted
candle, poured through tho streets
leading Into tho great squaro before
tho church of tho metropolitan,
Tho groat edifice, Illumined by thou
sands of hugo candles tn chandeliers
and candelabra, was packed to tho
doors, and tho squaro was filled to
Dennis Was Discouraged,
Having purchased a new bicycle, Mr,
Jackson presented his old ono, still
qulto serviceable, to his groom.
"You'll find it useful when you're In

"Sure, It's grateful Ol am to yer

"but Ol'm thinking Itll bo n long time

twinkling lights; tho windows and bal
conies of tho houses facing thrco sides
of the square wero ablazo with flicker
ing tapers, and even tho courses ot tho
church and Its boll towers wero out
lined by tho tiny flames. Tho stars
abovo looked pale and scattered' In
comparison.
Tho king and queen and other mem
bers of tho royal family, also govern
ment officials and noted guests, sat
upon the edgo ot the platform erected
In tho center of the square.
At length, the choir boys emerged
from tho doors of tho cathedral, fol
lowed by tho chanting prlosts, and
finally by tho metropolitan himself, ar
rayed In gorgeous robes, with a miter
on his head aud a bishop's crook In his
hand.
The procession ascended tho plat
form whero tho venerable, kind-hearted
man, with flowing whlto beard,
raised his flngors In blessing over tho
waiting worshipers, nnd tho beautiful
music ot tho mass floated out on the
silent nlr.
Besido our breakfast plates, on Sun
day morning, lay a bright red Easter
egg, an emblematic gift freely ex
changed in Greece but tho chief
ovent of this day of rejoicing was tho
dancing of tho soldiers and of tho
bodyguard of tho king.
Tho latter took placo In tho court
yard ot tho royal palaco, and tho mem
bers of the guard wero attired, as al
ways, In tho costumo of Thessaly, their
native provinco. As wo wero unpro-
pared for tho sight which met our
eyes, our first Impression wns that an
automaton ballet chorus was running
down.
They woro very full-plaited skirts of
starched whlto linen stopping several
Inches above tho knee whlto woolen

A whlto linen shirt, a zouavo Jackot
with loug flowing sleeves of whlto wool
embroidered with black, and a red cap
with a long black silk tassel reaching
below tho shoulder completed this
very immllltnry costume.
Monday was a quiet das', dlstln.

cony wo viewed the procession and
attendant crowds. At tho door ot tho
palaco across the squaro the king and
queen Btepped Into their carriage
They wero followed iu the procession
by tho Crown Prince Constantino anil
his wife, the sister of the kaiser, then
by Prlnco George and his bride, tho
Bonaparte princess, whom tho Greeks
welcomed with open arms, as the only
member of tho royal family who la

wero residents of Corsica whllo It was
Greek territory. Napoleon being born
only a fow days after its transfer to
Franco.
Tho procession, accompanied by
bands of music and a brilliant array
ot mounted soldiers, proceeded to the
church of tho metropolitan whero
mass was held.
On tho afternoon ot Easter Tuesday
all eyes wero turned toward Megara.
distant from Athens two hours by
train, whero the far-famed peasant
dances tako placo.
In tho large public square of tho
little town tho women, dressed In hol
iday attire, Joined bands alternately
across each other, forming long,
straight lines, and danced, first In one
direction and then in the opposlto, a
performance of no special graco or
beauty, but made attractive by their
protty faces and curious costumes, and
tho great numbers of lines, tripping
ono way and thon tho othor.
Beneath the black skirts bordered
with a broad, red band hung several
Inches of handmade thread lace, from
tho white petticoats, tho pride of the
Industrious wearer. Tho tight black
bodices and yellow head scarfs wore
adorned with many loops of silver
and gold coins, tho dowries of the
wearers, and some of the moro wealthy
were resplendent in trimming of gold
lace. They wero pleased when wo ad
mired tho beauty ot tho embroidery
which tholr own hands had wrought
on their nprons of bright-colored silk.
Tho crowd of spectators encircling
tho dancers was so dense that wo took
refuge In a balcony that overlooked
tho squaro and gained a most compre
hensive and picturosquo view. Here
and thero tho long lines formed into a
circle and a single man, attired in the
abbreviated costume of tho Thcssalo
nlnnB or In a checked gingham Jumper
with an equally short, full-ruflled skirt,
led tho national dance wo had seen In
Athens, to the accompaniment ot
stringed Instruments.
And thus closed tho Easter festivi
ties, but not tho holidays, for the pan
Hellenic games wero celebrated for
four days, beginning with Thursday
In thn wonderful ancient stadium, re
stored to pristine glory by the munifi
