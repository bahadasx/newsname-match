Editor's Note: The follow

gestion of the United Press,
outlines post war conditions in
England, as seen by Mr. Hen
ry Gordon Selfridge, the Amur.
Iran who Introduced the Amer
ican department store and
American business methods in
to London trade with enormous
financial success. Mr. Self
ridge long has been a close
student of international and
European commercial econom
ics. (By Henry Gordon Selfridge. written
for the United Press.)
Loudon, April 11. (By Mail.) Eu
rope will rise rapidly from the ashes
of war.
Demobilizing the great arrr.'ea re
starting the machinery and collecting
the thw4s of commerce will take
lime, but thn spirit of revival will be
much greater than ever before.
The belligerent nations' enormous
new machinery for making munitions
will, mostly, be adapted to developing
various manufactures. This will be
a gieat asset.
I question whether labor will ever
permit a return of the pre-war low
scale of wages in England, France or
Germany. 1 think the standard of
labor has been permanently raised
throughout Europe. I am very glad
of It.
Tremcudonj Impetus has been giv
en to female labor. European wo
men have for years wanted a larger
place In the commercial world. They
have it.
These women never again will oc
cupy dull, uninteresting places in the
home. This will increase the supply
of labor after the "war perhaps ,",o per
cent.
I think increased production will
employ part of this Increased supply.
The European labor supply at the be
ginning of the war was greater than
tiie demand. This was the reason for
the low wages.
Still I think I am right that wages
are permanently raised. I think they
will be raised by the power of the
trade unions.
Europe will, after the war, im 'rat
ter If it lasts two yeare more, have
enough money to do business.
Those who have been living on the
Interest of their money will suffer
most. The rich man who is active
can afford to lose his money because
lie is continually getting more.
It has been the custom for a man to
retire from or never enter business,
just living upon his small or large in
come, and seeking a peerage or baron
etcy. Now he will find It wise and In
viting to become a business man who
helps produce.
I think society, so often snobbish
and unintelligent in big affairs, will
break off the barnacles of the mid
Victorian period and again look upon
work, trade and commerce as praise
worthy rather than pitiable.
England has many beautiful estates
with much Idle ground. A great many
of these estates will be sold because
the owners cannot afford to hold them.
Thus much land heretofore idle v ill
become agricultural ground, used In
the real Interests of life.
Many young men who had uninter
esting posts have joined the army and
got a taste of fresh air and sunshine
which they will have difficulty in for
getting. Those posts now niupt be
made attractive and remunerative.
Probably a large number of these
young men will turn to newer coun-
tries: Canada, Australit, South Af
rica. The United Stateswlll get her large
share, but Europe will strive to keep
the best men.
I don't believe the young man
whoso head is full of brains and whose
body is full of good red blood will be
content to continue on the old, Borae
what feudal basis which existed in
parts of tlila portion of the world be
fore the war.
England is recognizing for the first
time In 50 years that commerce is the
most necessary branch of activity in

ALEX TEST
WELL 550
FEET DEEP
That the test well at Alex is now
O.'iO deep and that drilling In in pro
gress day and night, with prospects
that are considered very encouraging,
was the report given by A. V. Cooper,
field man for the Unity Oil company,
who was in Chickasha yesterday.
The Unity company is composed
principally of Kansas City men and it
has a drilling arrangement with the
Ben Hur Oil company, the owner of
the leases around Alex. The well that
is being drilled is only a short dis
tance from the Alex townsite.
1r Ctnur fctutpfl llutf thn 11W-1I
Hani Oil company had just made a lo
cation for a well about five miles
southeast of Alex and operations are
j expected to start in the near future.
He also said he was. informed that
the drilling of two wells near Cement
will begin within a short time, prep
arations for operations there being
practically complete.
It Is rumored that the Prairie Oil
and Gas company is seeking leases in
the Grady county field. Within the
past few weeks , interest in the wild
cat field near Marlow has picked up
and it is said that some good prices
have been paid for leases( on account
of thp closing of a deal for sinking a
veil in that locality.

BATTLE ON
LINKS WON
BY 1 POINT
How it happened, how it didn't hap
pen, why it happened and why it
didn't happen differently, bow it would
have happened if it hadn't happened
as it did, how it should have happen
ed, how it would have been if if if
if "ad infinitum infinitum" and then
some. All of these "it's" , and r.iore
were recited and amplified by the fel
lows who gathered about the festal
board aC the Chickasha Country club
Friday evening to feast and talk over
the great golf tourney which was won
by Capt. G. Blackburue's team by one
lone point.
With the score tied up at the elose
of the contest, the captains, Black
burne and H. Witherspoon met for a
final decisive offensive yesterday af
ternoon, the issue to be determined
by an lS-hole game. At the end o the
game, the score was still tied and j
then the two valiant champions agreed
to stake all on one more hole and
this time victory perched upon the
banner of the noble Blackburne.
Forty-five men, including a few who
ha not been implicated in the tour
ney, were seated at the dinner which
the losers furnished to the winners.
Tom Boyd was the architect and su
perintendent of construction of this
affair and he did the job to a queen's
taste. There was no speech-making
except when Ad Melton broke into the
peaceful proceedings to read and ex-
pound a certain written, signed and
sealed agreement entered into by Bob
Murray, guaranteeing that he would
get Ben Johnson's goat in his game,
a promise which was unfulfilled. The
after-dinner conversation dealt some
what extensively with the subject of
golf. Another tourney was announc
ed for next week.
