Officials Are Hoping That
No Ships Will Be Sunk
Pending Answer
Washington, D. C., April 21.—Word
from Ambassador Gerard at Berlin
that he had delivered the American
note to the German government and
some indication from him as to how
it was received were awaited with
keen expectancy by administration of
ficials today.
Unofficial advices early today saying
that he bad presented the communica
tion to the German foreign, office last
evening and that the chancellor had
not yet seen it because of his absence
at army headquarters were read with
interest by officials.
Pending Germany's reply to Amer
ica's demands that she immediately
abandon the present methods of con
ducting submarine warfare, one ot the
chief concerns of officials here is the
possibility of another attack on a ship
carrying Americans. It was admitted
that an immediate rupture could only
be prevented by proof that Germany
had been unable to communicate with
her submarine commanders.
It is suggested that the German
foreign office may be delayed in re
plying immediately because of a series
of religious holidays in Germany
xwhlcIT began today and continue Until
Tuesday.
Secretary Lansing, who conferred
with the president before today's brief
.cabinet meeting, said he did not ex
pect any action until a reply was re
ceived from Germany or unless an
other ship carrying Americans were
torpedoed by a German submarine. He
said that in case diplomatic relations
between the two nations were broken
the work of the United States in car
ing for the diplomatic interests of Ger
many in other countries in all likeli
hood would be suspended.
FRENCH APPLAUD NOTE.
Paris, April 21 —The comment of the
French press on President Wilson's
address to congress may be summed
up in these words, which the Petit
Parisien prints in large type as a head
ing over the text of the speech:
"Never has the head of a state pro
nounced such grave-words against a
state with which it was not at war."
The president's address has made a
deep impression in France. All the
newspapers give it the place of honor.
It overshadowed the British cabinet
crisis and even the arrival of Russian
forces at Marseilles. The speech is
not merely a formal injunction, the
Petit Parisien says it is a stern in
dictment, pronounced in the name, of
all neutrals "againBt German barbarity
and duplicity, marking the German
government with a brand which noth
ing can efface."
The Matin characterized the address
as epoch making and continues
"When the responsible and almost
sovereign head of a hundred million
free citizens mounts the rostrum in
congress to declare, 'We are the
spokesmen the rights of humanity,' he
has performed an act of immense mor
al Importance. It is in the name of
legality that this statesman, having
behind him the country on which the
whole world depends, declares before
the whole world: 'We will not tolerate
injustice.'
"In those few words his whole mes
sage is summed up. It is an historical
event, which is deserving of our admir
ation as one of the noblest acts in the
memory of mankind."
ARGENTINA WITH WIL80N.
Rio Janeiro, April 21.—The publica
tion of the American note to Germany
created a deep impression upon pub
lic opinion and the press. The Jour
nal Do Comraerclo says:
"The United States, profoundly im
pressed by the desponsibility it as
sumed in the American continent by
the proclamation, adoption and preser
vation of the Monroe doctrine, feels
clearly that If Germany is victorious,
sooner or later she will turn against
the United States the powerful weap
ons which will have conquered the
great strength of the allies."
The Gazeta De Noticias says:
"North America, by her diplomatic
attitude, makes herself the leader of
the neutral nations against piracy."
The Epoca holds that Germany's
war methods placed her in political
circles outside the human pale and
expresses no doubt that in case of war
•the United States will rally all the
•Smith American countries."

SPY'S CONFESSION
FURNISHES CLUES
TOURE PLOTTERS
MAN WHO GAVE DETAILS WHICH
LEO TO UNCOVERING OF PLOT,
BEING DETAINED.
New York, April ?1.—Horst von der
Goltz,. the German soldier of fortune
and secret agent whose statement of
details of
tpe
plot to destroy the Wei-
land canal wa3 made public by the
British government last night, is now
detained at the Ellis Island immigra-
tion station here. He was brought
here from Liverpool on March 28 in
the custody of a Scotland Yard detec
tive with the understanding that after
he had made his statements to federal
officers or a grand jury, he should be
returned to England to be detained as
a war prisoner until the war is over.
Soon after arriving here he was
taken before the United States district
attorney and It was said that he re
vealed to the federal officer most of
the details of the Welland canal plot.
As a result, it is said, of the informa
tion he gave to federal officials, indict*
inent3 were found a few days charging
complicity in the Welland canal con-'
spiracy against Capt. Franz von Papen,
the recalled irilitary attache of th9
German embassy Capt. Hans Tau
scher, who is said to be agent of the
Krupps Wolfe von Igel, Von Papen's
former secretary, in whose office fed
eral officials seized the documents now
claimed by the German embassy Al
fred A. Fritzen and Constantina
Covanl.
MAY RETURN PAPERS.
Washington, D. C., April 21—The
state and justice departments an
nounced today the government's wil
lingness to return to the German em
bassy all 'the papers seized in New
York with the arrest of Wolfe von
Igel, which Count von Bernstorff
will identify as official. The papers
were said to disclose several subjects
of an unusual nature which had not
before come to the attention of this
government. E'efinlte connection with
the German embassy would be con
firmed. it was believed, by a declara
tion that the documents are official.
rn. nnnnmpniH
Whether Secretary Lansing would
send a note to Ambassador von Bern
storff expressing regret for the seizure
was not announced but such action is
believed probable.
MORE INDICTMENTS DUE.
Washington, D. C., April 21.—Addi
tional indictments of German sympa
thizers in this country will be asked
by the department of Justice as a re
sult of revelations made by Horst von
der Goltz, alleged German spy brought
to New York by Scotland Yard detec
tives. This was learned authoritative
ly here today. Von der Goltz' state
ment was said by department officials
to have opened a "field practically
without limits'* for investigation. The
government will follow every clue.
It was understood today the number
of men involved in Von der Goltz'
activities In the United States is much
larger than had been thought hereto
fore.
The pending New York indictments
against five of Von der Goltz' assist
ants were said to embrace the alleged
leaders in the conspiracy to blow up
the Welland canal but indictment of
men involved in minor way in the al
leged conspiracy probably will be
sought soon. It was' understood in
dictments will also be asked in con
nection with Von der Goltz' other ac
tivities.
Many of the allegations in the
sworn statement of Horst von der
Goltz, made public in London last
nighti have been known to the de
partment of justice for weeks and
investigation h&s Nbeen made particu
larly into the activities of German
consuls in Chicago, St. Paul and Bal

tary authorities detailed to investi
gate the report that the body re
cently disinterred at San Francis

reported today they were unable
to obtain confirmation. No details
were given which would tend to

El Paso, Tex., April 21.—Movements
of American troops from points along
the border to the army base at Colum
bus, N. M., where they will be held in
readiness to reinforce Gen. Pershing's
army in case of necessity, still con
tinued today. Dispatches from the
front indicated that everything was
quiet and that American troops in
Mexico were awaiting developments
at Washington before making any
further effort to capture Francisco
Villa.
Officials of the de facto government
said there was no basis for the re
ports that uprisings were Imminent in
northern Durango and lower Chihua
hua. It was explained at Juarez that
the movement of the Carranza troops
into the Parral district was not in
tended as a threat to bar the further
advance of the American forces but
that the de facto soldiers had been
sent there to preserve order and pre-
.mi Vent destruction of private property.

expedition was concluded and that he
hoped that in a few days the order
would come from Washington for the
troops to be withdrawn.
VILLA EVERYWHERE.
El Paso, Tex., April 21.—The con
tinued absence of the confirmation of
tfye report of the death of Francisco
Villa has revived again the popular in
dustry in El Paso of locating the
bandit. During the last two days he
has been successively placed by "re
liable Mexican sources" in Durango,
Zacatecas and Coahuila. His last lo
cation today was given by a Mexican
railroad official as at San Isidro, a
little town about thirty miles south of
Parral, in Durango.
Little credence is placed in these
stories here by many Americans and
Mexicans who believe that Villa has
never been as far south as Parral and
that the real reason for the outbreak
against the American troops at that
town was that the Mexicans knew
Villa was in the north and concluded
that the American soldiers were not
pursuing the bandit but were engaged
in a veritable invasion of Mexico.
Gen. Gavira renewed today his re
peated statements that the Carranza
leaders had no hostile intentions to
ward the American columns while
they felt that the time had come for
the recall of the expedition.
No news has been received in Juarez
regarding the party headed by Gen.
Cavazos and Col. Carlos Carranza,
which set out last Sunday to search
for the supposed grave of Villa.

(Via aeroplane to Columbus, N. M.,
April 21.)—The flght at Parral, where,
according to Indisputable evidence
reaching here today, Carranza troops
in force attacked the cavalry command
of Maj. Frank Tompkins, has changed
the entire aspect of the Villa chase so
far as immediate military plans are
concerned.
Heretofore, the American troops
have reckoned only on meeting opposi
tion from brigandB, but resistance from
regular armed troops of the Mexican
army put the Amerioan military lead
ers immediately under the necessity of
preparing for serious difficulties. It can
be stated that within a few hours after
the Parral fight the new disposition of
American troops was partly complet
ed and within two days its most im
portant features had been entirely
carried out.
On April 12 about noon, Maj. Frank
Tompkins of the thirteenth cavalry,
who chased the ViHistas across the in
ternational line at Columbus, went in
to Parral with only a small portion of
his force, which totaled about 150
men including a pack train outfit. He
had Troops and of the thirteenth.
Conferred With Presldente.
Maj. Tompkins had taken the pre
caution the night before to send word
by a messenger to the presldente of
Parral, Luz Herrera, that he would call
upon him next day to arrange for buy
ing provisions and to have the Parral
military officials designate some camp
ing place for the Americans outside of
Parral in accordance with the agree
ment by which the American troops
are not to occupy Mexican cities. Maj.
Tompkins took only his advance guard
into the city during his call.
The presldente said he had not re
ceived the message which Maj. Tomp
kins had dispatched. The messenger
was a Mexican, a Carranza petty offi

JAPAN PROTESTS
INCLUSION OF "GENTLEMEN'S
AGREEMENT" IN NEW STAT
UTE IS REPUGNANT.
Washington, D. C., April 21.—Vis
count Chinda, the Japanese ambassa
dor, conferred with President Wilson
today over the provision of the pend
ing Immigration bill which proposed
to enact into law the so-called gentle
men's agreement restricting the im
migration of Japanese laborers. A
memorandum on the subject has been
presented to the state department.
The proposed inclusion in a law of
an informal agreement which Japan
has promised on honor to fulfill, ac
cording to the agreement between
Former Secretary Root and Former
Ambassador Takahira is understood
to be repugnant to the Japanese gov
ernment.
Other proposed Asiatic exclusion
features in the bill as It passed the
house and has been reported to the
senate are understood to be the sub
jects of objection.
For many obvious reasons the atti
tude of the administration is said to
be one of disinclination to irritate the
situation between Japan and the
United States which has been smoul
dering since the California anti-alien
land law negotiations went into an in*
definite stage three years ago this
summer. The United States never
has replied to Japan's last note on
the California land law. One portion
of the bill which is understood to
draw the resentment of the Japanese
government is the inclusion, by infer
ence at least, of Japanese in the ex
cluded class with Hindus, although
the same paragraph of the bill ex
cerpts from the exclusion such as are
covered in "existing agreements."
This phrase refers to the RootTaka
hira agreement.

jhwow! OTTUMWA. WAPELLO COUNTY, IOWA, SATURDAY, APRIL 22, 1916 NUMBER 106
STAMP OFFICE
TOBERESUMED
Treasury Department Gives
Sanction to Reopening
Revenue Agency Here
KIRKPATRICK GETS
LETTER FROM GATES
Acting Commissioner Tells
Ottumwan That Service
Will Begin May 1
The reopening of the stamp office In
Ottumwa, an accommodation to the
business men of this city and vicinity
that is considerable, is to be made ef
fective May 1.
This information came in a letter to
Sant Kirkpatxick, former congressman
from the sixth district, who has with
Secretary J. N. Weldenfeller of the
Commercial club, kept after the pro
ject almost continuously since the rev
enue stamp office ceased to be here
several months ago.
The history of the removal of the
stamp office and the efforts to get it
restored covers many months and has
been discouraging for failure has at
tended nearly every effort put forth by
the various forces that have striven
with the treasury department of the
United States to gst the service re
stored here.
The need for such an office here is
evident enough when It is considered
that Ottumwa is one of the biggest
cigar making centers In all of Iowa
and many millions of cigars are manu
factured here each year. The stamps
by these cigar and tobacco concerns
alone amonts to several thousand dol
lars in revenue collections annually
with perhaps as much collected from
the various other types of stamps,
documentary, proprietary, etc., that
will be handled when the office is es
tablished. It is expected that the re
opening of the office here will lead to
purchases of stamps being made here
by oth^r ^owns and cities that have
fofo~asC
Ittumwa has had to do for
some months past—send away for its
stamps.
Henry Glenn is Deputy.
Henry Glenn, cashier for the Farm
ers and Merchants bank, will be stamp
deputy or revenue agent, having
charge of the stamps and will handle
them at the bank, Mr. Glenn is well
known having been formerly county
treasurer, and later with the First
National bank before the opening of
the Farmers and Merchants bank.
The stamp office was removed from
Ottumwa July 1,1915. About a month
prior to that date, the attention of the
Commercial club was called to the
matter and the association as well as
citizens wrote Commissioner Osborne
in an effort to have the office retained
here. The lfetters were unavailing.
Secretary Weldenfeller then took the
matter up with Postmaster C. W. Mc
Carty.who was willing to handle the
stamps but needed extra help to take
care of the additional work and this
was denied him. Furthermore the
two departments, postofflce and treas
ury, operate under separate manage
ments and the arrangements could not
be made.
About the first of the year Sant
Klrkpatrick became interested in the
project and began to communicate
with the commissioner of internal
revenue and the treasury department.
Letter followed letter and the Wash
ington authorities were shown that
the collections here would Justify the
reopening of the office as Is promised
in the following letter to Mr. Klrkpat
rick:
Treasury Department,
Washington, D. C.,
April 18, 1916.
Hon. San ford Klrkpatrick,
Ottumwa, Iowa.
My dear Mr. Klrkpatrick:
Replying to your letter of the 14th
instant, you are respectfully advised
that it has been decided to reestab
lish the stamp office at Ottumwa and
the collector of the district will be in
formed that an allowance at the rate
of $200 per annum will be provided for
the compensation of the stamp dep
uty. It will be suggested that he as
certain whether an employe in one of
the local banks will take the position.
Referring to the other matter men
tioned by you, if you will send in the
name of the person you desire to have
employed as a form 10 man it is
thought that his employment can he
authorized, effective May 1, 1916.
Please also state the address of the
person referred to.
Respectfully,
David A. Gates,
Acting Commissioner.

DEFENDER8 OF VERDUN ON THE
OFFENSIVE AND REPORTING
IMPORTANT GAIN8.
London, April 21.—Offensive opera
tions by the French on both banks of
the Meuse in the Verdun region have
resulted in the wresting of territory
from the Germans.
Following up their success of yester
day in the region of Dead Man's hill,
Gen. Petain's forces returned to the
attack last night and according to this
afternoon's Paris bulletin captured ad
ditional trenches and took four of
ficers and 160 men prisoners.
In the Haudremont wood region east
of the Meuse, where substantial Ger
man gains were scored recently, the
French have been counter attacking
and report having more gains in last
night's fighting* The repulse of a
heavy attack by the Germans on this
front also is announced.
The arrival of a Russian army in
France and the statement from Paris
that the Germans are withdrawing
large forces from their fronts in Rus
sia, Serbia and Macedonia and throw
ing them into the line along /the
French front had added interest to the
great battle which for more than two
months has been raging before Ver
dun.
The Germans admit that the French
captured trenches in the Caillette
wood, west of Vaux, after a vigorous
attack, but say otherwise the attack
was repulsed with heavy losses.
Brlttons Beaten Back.
The Germans have, according to Ber
lin reports, driven the British back
six hundred meters around Ypres. The
British admit a small German gain but
declare the Germans were expelled
from moBt of the ground they cap
tured.
The Russians are pursuing the
Turks In Asiastlc Turkey, their ob
jective now being to cut off communi
cation between the northern and
southern Turk armies. Heavy fight
ing is reported in the Tehoruk region
where the Russians are making des
perate efforts to capture Balburt and
come Into contact with their army now
occupying Trebizond.
Artillery engagements along the
Russian, Genan and the Austro
Italian fronts are still going on.

which brought the Russian troops set)t
to join the entente allies' forces on the
western front had been expected since
Tuesday but a heavy storm in the Medi

until today.
Every precaution for their protection
had been taken, owing to reports that
hostile submarines were operating in
the Mediterranean, but the voyage was
concluded without untoward incident.

finding came after two days of argu
ment based upon testimony taken in
various cities of the country since the

Judges Julian W. Mack and Francis
