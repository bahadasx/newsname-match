PRAISE JUDGE SCULLY
Voters of All Parties Loud in
Commendation of the Last
Two Elections Under
His Management.
Judge Thomas P. Scully of tho
County Court, head of tho election
machinery of Chicago, and Its envir
ons, Is receiving pralso from all quar
ters for the crodltablo manner In
which tho lato city election and tho
recent great primary election wero
handled by his subordinates.
Judge Scully Is a man who knows
his duty and Is faithful to every trust
Imposed on him.
ROTTEN POSTAL SERVICE
Overpaid and Inefficient Superin
tendents Should Be Fired .
From the - Chicago
Postoffice.
Tho treatment accorded newspaper
publishers by the Bureaucracy now
managing the Chicago Postofllcc is a
serious reflection upon the adminis
tration. Everything possible Is done
by the Job holding aristocracy now in
charge thero to Impedo the circulation
of weekly newspapers. The law
plainly and specifically provides that
all publishers shall bo notified
promptly of the change of address of
subscribers.
Tho Chicago Postofflco In many in
stances violates this law by rubber
stamping upon the paper "Notify pub
lisher of change of address" and let
ting it go at that. If the subscriber
fails to grasp this notice, the paper Is
returned to the publisher and tho sub
scriber and the paper part company.
As a pleasing Instance of tho utter
disregard of facts sby tho Chicago
Post Ofllco Bureaucrats, lot us give
you ono examplo:
On March 17 last The Englo was
notified in the regular way by tho
postoffice that George W. Pnullin had
moved to 222 Michigan Blvd. Building.
On April 18 of this week, Tho
ANDREW J. GRAHAM.'
Public Spirited Citizen and Open Hearted
Eagle was notified In the usual wayl
that the paper addressed to Georgo
W. Paullln, 222 Michigan Blvd. Bldg.,
was undelivered, because George W.
Paullln was "NOT THERE."
A telephone call developed the fact
that Georgo W. Paullln was there and
that he was carrying on the largest
fur business in Chicago at that num
ber. The overworked and underpaid let
ter carriers and clerks of the Chicago
Postofflco are, as a whole, all right.
Some of the overpaid "Superintend
ents" should bo sent to the dump.
