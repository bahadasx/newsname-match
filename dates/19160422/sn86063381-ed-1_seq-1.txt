Charles Ruggles of Manistee, Mich.,
owner of the famous "Ruggles'
Pines" north of Bemidji is in the [FEELS 6000 TO GET
city today on business He is in
vestigating matters pertaining to his
real estate holdings and expects to
be in the city for several days.
Mr. Ruggles favors the plan of
making a park of his timber at the
head of the lake but stated to a Pio
neer representative that he had never
been approached on the subject.
Park a Good Thing.
"I have considerable real estate
holdings in Bemidji," said Mr. Rug
gles, "and anything that will help
Bemidji grow and prosper will in
crease the value of my holdings. The
park undoubtedly would be a fine
thing.
"However, I have never been ap
proached by the city or anyone else
on the question of establishing a
park. No proposition has ever been
submitted to me. It is a great deal
like a recent experience that I had.
My chore boy told everyone else that
was employed by me that he was
going to resign his job. He told me
on Saturday night when he quit.
Fight Condemnation.
"I have heard it reported that ef
forts will be made by certain citizens
to get the tract for a park by con
demnation proceedings I believe
that I should be approached on the
matter and would fight any condem
nation proceedings."
Mr. Ruggles stated that he be
lieved that Bemidji would show a
good growth during the next year.
He stated that the growth of a city
depends on good bankers and good at
torneys and told of the experiences in
Detroit, Mich., where attorneys and
bankers had much to do for the
growth of that city. The attorneys
aided in stopping litigation of worth
less kinds between individuals and
the bankers only backed the business
that was legitimate and was for the
best interest of the city.
W ^T IS QUIET ALTHOUGH
btv HAVE BIG DEPOSITS
*u
Conditio^ he west are not the
best, everyth* quiet, but the
banks all show ncreases in de

bank, who returned this morning with
his daughter, Miss Marion, from San
Diego, Cal., and other western
points.
Mrs. White will return to Bemidji
tomorrow, having stopped at St. Cloud
to visit her sister, Mrs. Shoemaker.
Mr. White stated this morning
that if he was chairman of the Be
midji charter commission he would
call a meeting next week to consider
an amendment to the charter for the
assessments in the installation of the
"white way."
BACK SAYS BACON
"The best part of my trip is the
returning to Bemidji," said C. M.
Bacon, who returned from a western
trip with his wife this morning.
"It feels fine to get back to Be
midji," he added.
Mr and Mrs. Bacon visited at San
Diego, Cal., and other points in the

war, according to Mr. Bacon, espec
ially at San Diego, which is only a

bus Villa Menace May Have

Washington, April 22.A different
aspect of the Mexican problem today
caused a growing concern. It is re
ported that a movement headed by
Felix Diaz, nephew of the former
Mexican dictator, has been begun
against the de facto government.
The Diaz movement, it is said, has
the backing of various elements both
in Mexico and in this country. As
viewed by the state department it is
understood the activities of these
persons are the more dangerous be
cause they are wealthy.
While no definite information was
obtainable there were indications
that some Washington officials at
least thought it possible that the
Diaz interests were seeking to under
mine General Carranza among his
various commanders Should clear
indications of this become apparent,
the attention of General Carranza
probably will be called to the situa
tion.
