Washington. April 21. President
Wilson and the cabinet discussed the.
Mexican situation today but did not
,'leddP on any course of action. J?ur

";L ,h m.rsult of Villa or with
drawal of the troops from Mexico will ,

,,r,l Scott, chief of staff of the army
to conditions on the border and in
Mexico. , . ,
Onernl Scott, who reached San
Antonio, Tex., tonight, to confer with
(ienerul Funston, was not expecting
to scud a report on the situation un
til tomorrow. His full report upon
which n decision ns to the next step
10 be taken probably will not be made
until his return to Washington. When
he left here, the chief of staff said he
would make his investigation and re
t urn ns quickly as possible. He could
not Indicate how long he might be
Son'- . .
Pending word from uenerai won,
.Secretary Raker reiterated his state
ment that no change had been made
in orders to General Funston nnd that
the department had no knowledge of
any change In the latter', orders to
General Pershing. No official report
had been .received, he said, that the
expedition was at ft standstill.
The secretary stated that what had
been a rumor, the report that .Mexi
can officers had warned General Per
shing not to proceed south of Parral,
was fact. It was learned at the state
department that a rumor to this ef
fect was transmitted some days be
fore the Parral incident through con
sular agenti. Mr. Baker Insisted that
"lite, warnine hud nad liu change- tn
the department's order to the border
forces.
To Call Carranza Down.'
It was indicated tonight that a re
ply to General Carranza's telegram
calling attention to the dash at Par
ral and asserting that the American
commander had violated his orders
and the agreement with the de facto
government in entering the town,
would be dispatched soon. War de
partment officials say the report on j
the Incident from General Pershing, i
Major Tompkins nnd other officers, Is
not complete. It has been withheld
from publication because of the flat
contradiction It contains of the ud
vioeg from General i'arranza ns to
the part his troops played in the !
fighting.
With this report ns a basis, the Par
ral incident will lie treated as a mat
ter entirely separate from the sug
gestion of the de facto government
that the troops be withdrawn. Offi
cial indicated that Carranza's atten
tion would be called to the discrepan

It unlikely he would attempt to up
hold his original report In the light
of mote recent Information and no
lengthy correspondence is looked for..
Felix Diaz Cau.sc Com-oni.
While immediate Intel est centers
naturally in the situation as to the
troops In Mexico, there were renewed
indications about the state depart
ment today that a wholly different
aspect of the .Mexican problem was
causing growing concern. That is the
movement supposedly headed by Fe
lix Diaz, nephew of the former Mex
ican dictator, for a new revolution
against the de facto government.
.None of the information upon which
the uneasiness rest3 has been dis
closed, it is known, however, that
several Mexicans In the United States
are being closely watched and It
"ems possible that some of the anti
American feeling in Chihuahua state
"nich has met the troops pursuing

ment. The Diast government, It Is said,
has the backing of various elements
"f Mexicans, both in Mexico and this
country. AH viewed by the state de
partment, it ig understood the activi
ties of these persons are the more
dangerous because they are wealthy,
while the de facto government is In
volved in a snarl of financial com
plications which would be hard to
overcome, even In times of complete!

obtainable tonight, there were Indi
cations that some Washington offic
ials, at least, thought It possible that
the Diaz interests were seeking to un
dermine General CarfunzA among his
various commanders!' Should dear
indications of this become apparent
the attention of General Carranzu
probably will be called to the situa
tion. It was pointed out Rt the war de
partment today that the portion of
Chihuahua where the pursuit of Villa
has been in progress, hus been doubt
ful territory at best. Many of the so
called Carranza garrisons are known
to be wavering now, one way and now
the other in their allegiance.
Since no new revolution could be
started In territory where American
troops were operating, It is regarded
as possible that recent events were
the result, In part, at least, of a de
liberate effort to create conditions
that would compel their withdrawal
without Irritating the United States to
a point whore Intervention nnd mili
tary occupation of northern Mexico
might result.

Washington, April 21. Prelimi

there Is good ground for the belief
that a demand for the article will lie

are morp universally eaten than Is

off the Massachusetts coast ship all
of the lurge species of shark, with one

the shark thou looks not unlike a

In the United States there Is a prej

went In perfect good fnlh Into Parral,
lii the most friendly fashion. Mocked
what seemed to be an excellent op
portunity for either the capture of

strongest brtmls.
Heretofore the American troopn
have reckoned only oil meeting oppo
sition from brigands, 'Mit resistance
from regular armed troops vf tho
Mexican army put th American mili

necessity of preparing for serious dif
ficulties. On April 12, about noon,

After the Parral fight tho authorities)
ther claimed they had discovered

killed by Vllllstus.
Tho conference with the president
and with the Carrnnza genoral com
manding In Parral, Gen. Ismuel Lo-
zano, was pleasant. Promises wen
made to sell the Americans food nnd.
to show them a good camping place.

When the Americans, accompanied
by Herrera and Loznno, were out of
the town, nt their rear, Major Tomp

saw that someonp In thn town was
shooting at tho pack train. He had
heard shouts of "Viva . Villa" and
I "Viva Mexico" nn, curses against
"gringoes." The Americans were in a.
column formed for defense when the
firing began. Soon the firing became
out to cut off the road to the east and
the north, where he would huve to re

As the fight began, Major Tomp
