note is a d'eoidediy strong one and
that it will be examined wtih Ger
man thoroughness.
Washington, April 22.—With official
word that the American note had been
presented to the Berlin foreign office,
officials here today momentarily ex
pected word from Ambassador Gerard
as to some outline of the nature of the
reply.
In reporting the delivery of the note
Ambassador Gerard advised the state
department that he had conferred
briefly with Foreign Minister von
Jagow.
The contents of another message
from the ambassador was closely
guarded, altho it was said he informed
the department assurances had been
given him of immediate consideration
of the document.
Some officials declare they expect a
reply from Germany by the middle of
next week.
It is known that Count von Bern
storff has advised his government to
modify Its-submarine warfare.
Chairman Stone, of the foreign re
lations committee, is to go over the
situation with the president Monday
evening*. When the American note was

The German embassy has been in
formed Uiat the documents will be

Count von Bernstorff will be asked to
distinguish between the official and
personal papers.
The German embassy will probably
not agree to this, as it is said that
personal papers can not be removed
from papers belonging to he embassy.
The embassy was perturbed toy the
announcement that the department
would keep photographic copies of the
papera.
The documents arrived at the depart

They comprise the contents of two
portfolios and two letter flies.. Some of

Borlin, Aprll 22.—The American note
Is now In the hands of Emperor Wil

chief of the general staff, at the gen-?

iA summary of the note was tele

The deliberations of the emperor,

The Lokal Anrelger's prediction that

borne out by the fact that it has been

Paris, April 22.—'Unqualified admira

In an extended analysis of the mes
sage H. Clemeneeau says:
"What strikes one above all in this
piece of world diplomacy which the
chief of the American republic has sub
mltted to the national representatives,
is its fine, Impassive objectivity. Facts,
no signs of literature, contrary to what
we have seen In the case of other coun
tries. Nothing, too, of the learned
lawyer, by happy surprises, Simple,
strong words of a statesman.
"The rights which the Pilgrim fath
ers of the (Mayflower brougiht to Eu
rope, their sons are bringing back to
use under a shield of arms. Hall to
you, Americans citizens, who march
back into the history of Europe under
a great arch on the front of which
Washington, Jefferson,' and so many
others have carved the noblest claims
of humanity.
"What the kaiser may decide to do
Is unimportant. Withdrawal or bom
bast—It will be all the same in the
end."
