Besides his trip to Chicago, where

go to Kansas City to deliver the Me

that effect having come to him from
the representative citizens of that city

Of still greater interest, particularly |

" | Roosevelt, after having delivered a
1 patriotic address In Kansas City, might
" i enlarge the tour to include two or
