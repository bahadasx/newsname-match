Chihuahua Papers Knew of
War Ultimatum Before It
Made Public in U. S.
ARKEPT well informed
Six Villa Bandits Found Guil
ty of Murder for Partici
pation in Columbus Raid.
El Paso, Tex., April 21. On Mon
day the Chihuahua city newspapers
printed dispatches, supposed to have
come from Juarez, stating that Presi
dent Wilson was about tb deliver an
ultimatum to Germany and that war
would be declared within a week.
This information was brought here
by Americans returning from Chi
huahua, who brought copies of the
newspapers in which the dispatches
appeared.
. The arrivals said that the news of
the crisis between Germany and the
United States was common talk in
Chihuahua city on Sunday, forty-eight
hours before the facts were made
public in this country. On Monday
an American who visited Gutierrez
was greeted with this remark:
; "Well, I suppose the Mexican situ
ati'Jn has become of minor importance
now that the United States is going to
war with Germany."
The six Villa bandits placed on trial
at Deming, N. M., charged with kill
ing Charles D. Miller in the Columbus
raid, were found guilty of murder in
the first degree, according to word
received here. The jury was out
thirty minutes.
Reports from Mexico tell of in
creased rather than lessened difficul
ties surrounding the expedition. An
instance of this isthorepffrt that an
unknown number of Carranza troops,
estimated at l,500,"hqve been mdved
by their immediate commander to the
Parral region, where Gen. Pershing s
most advance base is now located
The observer who reported this add
ed that while the movement, he be
lieved, was not authorized by the dc
facto government's head, it was in
tended as a hint that the Americans
must not move farther southward. It
was accepted as added proof that the
outlying Carranza garrisons are not
entirely under the control of the war
minister, Gen. Obrcgon.
Unofficial reports were that Villa
had made his way south into Duran
go, although official Mexican advices
continue to indicate that officials in
Mexico City yefgavc some credence
to the story that the. bandit chieftain
had died of his wounds at some point
soutlrof Cusihuiriachic.
Villa if he is alive can bo caught,
only by the adoption of a plan that
Mexicans almost certainly would char
acterize as a war. Ho has penetrated
1 so far into Mexico and the hostility of
1 Mexicans, both friends of Villa and
adherents ofthe de facto government,
i has become so marked that army offi
cers are convinced further operations
'must be undertaken with the under-
standing that armed opposition
both factions will be met.

.Washington April 21. As a result
of his conference Thursday, Count
von Bernstorff sent another com
munication to his government Last
evening. The ambassador does not
expect to call upon Secretary Lansing
again until after his government had
made formal reply to the American
Kioto. .
Just how long the United btates is
willing to wait, for the German reply
has not been disclosed. All officials
acrree that "a reasonable time will
be allowed. Press dispatches an
nouncing that the note had arrived in
Berlin were read but official word of
the delivery of the communication
had not been received.
The fact that a ceries of religious
holidays, which are scrupulously ob
served in the German empire, begin
to-dav. Good Friday, to continue
until next Tuesday, has boen sug-
gested as a possible source of delay
on the part of the German foreign
office.
Washington was deluged with tele
grams during the day. Great num
bers which arrived at the white house
congratulated President Wilson for
his stand. Congressman represent
ing districts with large German popu
lations received hundreds of messages
from individuals and organizations,
protesting against any action by con
gress which might lead to war be

MARKET IS
NEARING END
Average Price Still Rises As
Receipts Grow Smaller
Each Week.
Loose floor sales of tobacco dropped
this week to 210,000 pounds, with the
highest average price of the year, fine
le3f .being quoted at $11.75.
rhe nso in tobacco has had the ef
fect of making some farmers who had
contracted to sell their crops jump
their contracts. These contracts were
entered into to deliver the crop by a
certain date and some parties are in
terpreting the contracts to mean that
they will expire on the dates named.
The buyers claim that a violation of
the contract for any cause will give
them the right to recover damages
equal to their losses. If money has
been advanced on the tobacco, the
parties selling to some one else, they
are liable to prosecution. The local
warehousemen are, up in tho nir this
week over the developments in the
tobacco market in the light ofthe war
talk. They do not know whether to
look for a further increase or a sud
den drop.
