Great Feast of Gladness "Which
Dominates All Other
Festivals.
Upon This Great Festival De
pend All the Other Movnblc
Feasts.

"Worship.
THE JOYS OF THE RESURRECTION
Easter Sunday Is the great feast
of gladness, which in the liturgical
cycle dominates all other festivals.
During Advent we awaited our Lib
erator and sighed for his coming.
At Christmastlde and the Epiphany
we celebrated his arrival and his
different manifestations. In Sep
tuageslma time and Lent we
meditated on his sufferings; but
we have always foreseen victory at
the end of the combat, nnd we
mourned for a period, only to re
jolco with a fuller joy on the
gladsome Easter morn. Upon this
great festival depend all the other
movable feasts that we havo still
to celebrate the Ascension, Pente
cost, Trinity Sunday and Corpus
Christ I. From the liturgical point
of view Easter is therefore the cen
ter of Christian worship, just as
from the point of view of dogma
It is the basis of our faith and
hope, for as St. Paul says: "If
Jesus Christ be not risen again,
then is our preaching vain. . . . And
If in this life only we havo hope
in Christ, we are of all men most
miserable!"
Easter falls on the Sunday fol
lowing tho fourteenth day of the
March moon. The Pasch of the
Jews was celebrated on that four
teenth day Itself, no matter with
what day of the week it coincided,
one of tho effects of the resurrec
tion being the substitution of Sun
day for Saturday as tho Lord's day.
St. Peter in the beginning ordered
the celebration of Easter on the
Sunday after the Jewish Passover.
The example of the Roman church
was followed by all the other
churches of the world with the ex
ception of those in consular Asia,
which pretended that they had the
authority of St. John for following
In this matter the custom of the
Jews. The immediate successors of
St. Peter tolerated this dissldence,
but the churches of Asia having
gone so far as to censure tho prac
tice of tho Roman church the latter
condemned them.
4 In tho early ages of Christianity
the faithful embraced one another
on this feast with tho greeting, "The
Lord is truly risen," to which "And
appeared to Simon" was the re
sponse." All thronged to tho
church at dawn; tho priest intoned
tho canticle of the Resurrection,
kissed the imago of the Risen
Christ, and then gavo tho kiss of
"dilection" to the most worthy of
the congregation, who com-
municated it to tho others in order.
The faithful performed tho same
coremony among themselves, with
out distinction of age or rank or
wealth, but only that of sex tho
men and women originally occupy
ing separate portions of the
church. He who gave the kiss of
"dilection" said. "The Lord is truly
risen;" to which the answer was
"And has appeared to Simon," or
"Thanks be to God." Easter being
at one epoch tho first day of tho
civil year, these religious demon
stration's corresponded to our ox
change of good wishes on New
Year's day. This primitive custom
still exists in Poland and Russia.
In theso countries tho formula of
salutation and response thereto on
Easter Sunday is identical with
that of the early Christians. In
some churches there was a chapel
of the Sepulchre, where on this
festival a sort of dialogue was car
ried on between the Apostles and
Uie holy women. "Tell us, Mary,
what have you seen on tho way?"
To which the representative of Mary
replied: "I havo seen the sepulchre
of the living God." This dialogue
was borrowed, it will be,, seen, from
the prose of the festival; as the
other formula, tho Lord is truly
risen, is found in the offices of
Easter and its octave. In other
localities three young clorics,
clothed in white, with their heads
enveloped In largo veils, stood be
hind the sepulchre personating tho
first three Marys. Tho dialogue be
ing finished, tho clergy retired sing
ing Sclmus Chrlstmus Surexlsse,
"We know that Christ has risen."
The special period of the liturgi
cal year known as Paschal time,
and comprising fifty days from Eas
ter to Pentecost, was celebrated
originally as a series of continuous
festivals. The church desired that
as her children havo given them
selves up to sorrow during the
forty days of Lont, they should
now give themselves up unreserv
edly to the joys of tho resurrection.
The Holy Fathers bid us look on
theso fifty days of Easter as tho
Imago of our eternal happiness.
This whole period being considered
a prolonged Sunday, to It were ap
plied the principles regulating the
observance of Sunday Itself. All
theso fifty days are like so many
Sundays, says St. Ambrose. During
the Paschal season It was forbidden
to fast, and even the most rigorous
monastic rules yielded to this uni
versal - praetlee.
ST. CECILIA'S.
An unusually good programme
will be rendered by St. Cecilia's
choir on Easter Sunday morning at
the 10:30 o'clock mass, which will
be solemn high. Tho choir of St.

BENEFIT OF MANY PRAYERS,
The death of Mrs. Bridget Raw
ley last Saturday morning marked
tho passing of the mother to many,
she being ninety years of ago and is
survived by threo generations, re
markable in number. Among those
are" two sons, Lieut. M J. Rawley
nnd A. J. Rawley; two daughters,
Mrs. Winifred Honnessy and Mrs.
P. J. Ridge; nineteen grandchildren
and eighteen great grandchildren.
The deceased was a native of the
County Mayo, Ireland, coming to this
country when but a child, living for
several years In Richmond and Fair
mont, Va., before coming to Louis
ville, she and her husband, Pat
rick Rawley, since deceased, being
one of the pioneer families in the
Irish settlement on Fifth street
The funeral took place from the resi
dence of her daughter, Mrs. "Wini
fred Honnessy, 1019 EaBt Breckin
ridge street, Monday morning at
8:30 o'clock and from St. John's
church at 9 o'clock. Following the
requiem mass Rev. Father Schuh-
mann delivered tho funeral sermon,
In which he paid many eloquent -tributes
to the deceased, citing tho fact
that she was blessed by living more
than the allotted time of human life
and though her life, as tho life of
any mother, was filled with sacri
fices, yet ehe was rewarded in a
measure by seeing tho growth of a
largo generation around her, and
above that would be the knowledge
now that tho prayers of tho many

HOUSING
Vitally Concerns preservation of
Ilcalthly Family Life of
Country.
Good Housing: One of tlic-Most
Necessary Fundamental
Reforms.
Effort Which Deserves Strongest
Support and Sympathy
of All.
PROTECTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL
We are all most vitally con
cerned with the preservation of
healthy family life among the peo
pla of. our.. countryws.Suclu.famllx,
life spells the welfare of the na
tion. It means also the protection
of tho individual. , Even those who
most brazenly assault the institu
tion of maniago and the family re
lationship do so as a rule, strange
as It may seejn, under the pretense
of strengthening this fundamental
social, organism. They implicitly
lecognlzo the important and vital
position which the family holds In
the fabilc of society.
Moral environment the good ex
ample of parents, the Influence of
religion plays an important part in
tho well ordering of tho family.
Material environment must not,
however, at all bo lost sight of.
Bad housing, congested conditions,
often mean a low moral and phy
sical condition for the father and
mother and little children. "Shel
ter," says tho Bishop of North
ampton, "is as necessary to human
beings as food nnd drink. And tho
proper shelter for tho human fam
ily Is 'home' with all tho beauti
ful associations that that word re
calls recalls, that Is, for the av
erage fortunate Briton, but so
empty of meaning or even so re
plete with sad nnd shameful mem
ories for some thousands both In
town and country."
That the houses of our working
people In this country are In many
Instances far from conducive to
healthy family life Is by now well
known. That it Is tho rich and
wealthy people of the community
who are thriving off of these so
called "homes" In a gieat number
of cases has been repeatedly told.
The Governor of Kansas, in an ad
dress to the members of the Kansas
City Council of Women's Clubs, re
cently reiterated this fact. "The
tax lecords of Kansas City," Gov.
Capper said, "show that some of the
most filthy,' tumbled-down rental
property is owned byt wealthy cit
izens or corporations 'controlled by
them. These men live well on tho
15 per cent, they get from the
rental of this unhabitable property.
There should be a law," tho Execu
tive added, "compelling the land
lord to clean up the properly he
rents. The State law should see
that the room In which tho child
sleeps is in a sanitary, healthy
place, and not a dark closet at the
end of a blind hallway, In a tumbled-down
shack, owned by a man
who thinks only, How much rent
can I get?' The health records at
Topeka show that In Kansas City pf
the 2,100 children born last year
216 died before they reached the
age of one year and CO por cent.
of diseases that can bo provonted."
As to the influence of bad hous
ing on morality, records 'can not
show, but that intense overcrowding
Is most baneful In Its results can
well be the cause of the acquisition
of evil habits by tho little "Inhabi
tants of the city streets." Tho pro
vision of good housing Is one of
the most necessary, because one of
tho most fundamental of our re
forms. Slum landlords should be
reminded of their great duty to pro
vide deecnt places of habitation for
tholr tenants. Laws should be
passed establishing a standard" for
housing conditions, such as Is In
existence In certain Commonwealths.
This is an effort which deserves the
strongest support and sympathy of
all. C. B. of C. V.

MORE OF "VOTE DELIVERERS"
The lesult of the pilmary elec
tions In Nebraska Tuesday means
the elimination of William Jon-ningaBrj'nn5iffomDemocratlcpoli-i
tics, not only In his home State
but in national politics, as without
prestige in his own bailwlck he will
not be sent as a delegate to na
tional conventions in the future.
The "10 to 1" apostle stumped the
State in behalf of his brother for
the nomination for Governor, tho
latter being defeated badly; Bryan
ndvocated prohibition candidates.
they weie defeated and last but not
least, he was a candldato for dele
gate to the national Democratic
convention, four to be chosen, but
the best he could do was run ruth.
Political prospects this year also
point to the elimination of another
disturber in public affairs and espe
cially In tho Republican party, and
that Is Roosevelt, The latter has
been a continual agitator and, liko
Biyan in the Democratic party, has
always caused trouble and dissen
sion. Bryan keeps in tho . calcium
light by Chautauqua lectures and
sudden advocacj" of silly policies of
the grape-juice order, while lloose-
veJt keeps in the public eye by cir
cus advertising of his hunting ex
peditions In which he discovers
"rlveis of doubt" and unheal d of
birds and animals. But his long
suit is to wiap tho American flag
about himself and rush down to
the footlights In the style of old
Avenue melodramas, shouting "Give
mo war or give mo death."
Kentucky Democrats arc not sur
prised at tho present attitude of tho
Louisville Herald, which, In lino
with the other papers of the Shaffer
syndicate, havo dropped the Bull
Moose party and are now working
stienuously for the nomination of
the Rough Rider In the Republican
convention, this having been pre
dicted over a year ago, the Herald
deserting the Progressives and the
lean years for the G. O. P. and tho
fat years In prospect. Daily that
oigan tells how somo former
staunch supporter of Taft has been
converted to support of Roosevelt,
but neclects to tell that In f912
the Supporters of Taft in this dis
trict wero only a few hundred, the
Republican party hero having gone
over breech and breeches to tho
Bull Moose party with Wood Axton
and Capt. Fox as the leaders, the
latter securing the Congressional
nomination in 1912 while Axton
raptured tho Bull Moose nomination
for Mayor tho following year. Along
that line it is rumored .that Axton
Is 1elng groomed for the G. O. P.
nomination hero next year, his
friends saying that with the united
strength of the Progressives and
Republicans he could not lose.
There Is an old proverb to tho ef
fect that you musn't count your
chickens beforo they aro hatched
and there is one in local Demo
cratic circles that is spoken of for
the nomination and It chosen Axton
and his mixed following would nover
hear the boll tap or know tho
flag had fallen. The man refened
to is our present County Attorney,
A. Scott Bullitt.
In accordanco with tho French
system of dueling, tho contestants
after a lot of bluster and threats
usually go through a bloodless duel,
then fall on one another's neck and
feel satisfied. This would seem to
nnnlv to the nresent situation in
jthe Democratic party over the
'squabble for the post of National
. Democratic Committeeman. Wood
eon won a victory In the National
Committee and Haldeman has won
victory by receiving the indorse
ment of tbi Stanley-James faction
for the honor in the coming Stato
convention. This should serve to
satisfy both, as in the custom of
French duels, and they should now
retlro to the rear of the stage.
There Is and has not been a crying
demand for either Woodson or Hal
deman from tho party as a whole,
and both owe it to tho party for
the sake of that "harmony" now
. prevalent to bury tholr grievances
and ambitions. By the way, many
Democrats are or the opinion that
1 Gen. Haldeman might seo to .It
j that there Is a more open espousal
or Democratic policies and candi
dates In his organs, tho editorial of
Watterson's on last Wednesday be
ing the greatest boost for Roosevelt
read In some time.
One of tho local labor organs Is
put out at the criticisms appearing
In theso columns concerning the
Trltterlng away of the tlmo and
runds of campaign committees on
the "walking delegates" and "labor
vote deliverers," this being regard
ed by many as the chief cause for
tho narrow escape of Stanley and
the Democratic ticket In the last
election. That the Governor and
other officials believe this to be
true is shown by the cold turn
down these "vote deliverers" and
'official labor indorsers" have re
ceived in the appointments of State
Labor Inspector and members of
tho Workmen's Compensation
Board. Their defender did not deny
the proof shown in theso columns
ivhy candidates from every part of
the country have been the victims
of theso "vote dellveiers." Hermann
Ncwcomb was a victim of this In
dorsement a few years ago, not
realizing its handicap, while Owen
Tyler for Mayor and others too
numerous to mention suffered in lo
cal races. Union laboring men and
worklngmen in general tebel at tho
Idea of being dictated to by men who
haven't worked at a tiade In years
and the official indorsement of
these self-appointed labor leaders
naturally drives them into the rival
camp. The moral is if you want
to be successful In race for political
honors have the "vote deliverers"
Indorse the other fellow.

ADMIRAL VON TIRPITZ
German Minister of the Navy, who
recently resigned after dispute with
tho Chancellor.
"500 FOR !(."
At a rousing meeting held Mon
day night Trinity Council, Y. M. I.,
launched forth their, membership
campaign with "500 for 230" as
their slogan, meaning 500 members
for Trinity Council No. 230, as sug
gested by E. J. Cooney at the rally
or get-together meeting, held at the
Tyler Hotel on April 13. From ev
ery indication this campaign will be
the strongest contest ever staged by
Trinity Council, as all tho members
have pledged themselves either to
somo team or to work Individually.
There aro at present seven teams
in the race with the following cap
tains: W. J. Sandmann, Thomas
Murphy, F. Efflnger, Ed Zehnder.
B. J. Sandmann, H. J. Hennessy and
E. C. Mueller. A number of appli
cations were received at the meeting
on the opening night, which Is a
good sign of the enthusiasm dis
played by tho members in making
this campaign a success. The lec
tuio delivered "by William Klapheke,
Past Grand Knight of the Knights
of Columbus, on tho popular topic,
"Preparedness," was enthusiastically
iccelved by all the members pres
ent. His remarks were not only
very Instructive but likewise con
vincing, and was a real treat for
the members. Trinity Council's ball
team went down In defeat before
the Bertrands on last Sundny In the
opening game of the Twin City
League, but have since strengthened
themselves with several new play
ers, and can bo looked to fiom now
on as being at all times a contender
for tho 191G flag.

ADDITIONAL TAXES FOR IRELAND
The people of Ireland are not
loyal to England In the nresent war.
and the sentiment of the lecent
great gathering of the Irish race
convention In New York City is but
a reflection of the sentiment of tho
people of Ireland today. The
American press has been filled with
paid matter sent out by the Eng
lish Government in which claims
were made that the Irish were re
cruiting in large numbers and that
there was harmony between tho
two countries. Little by little tho
truth Is creeping out, stories of
rioting In different parts of Ireland,
the continuance of 60,000 English
troops In Ireland when they aro
badly needed In the trenches, and
now the suppression of the Irish
Nationalist press and wholesale ar
rests show that all Is not what John
Bull wishes for and incidentally
proves that tho stories of Irish loy
alty are furnished by a first-class
band of English prevaricators with
a branch of their press bureau in
Now York.
Last week in Ireland four Na
tionalist papers were suppressed in
Dublin, because of attacks upon the
British Government In connection
with the war. They are tho Spark,
Honesty, tho Gael and the Gaelic
Athlete. The Cork Weekly Ex
aminer and Herald, the Weekly In
dependent (from Dublin), the Bel-
lasi weeKiy News, tho Dublin Free
man and the Dundalk Democrat aro
among the Irish papers still coming
to America. The Irish-American
and Catholic weeklies In the United
States, of which 98 per cent, are
decidedly pro-German, aro not al
lowed to bo received in Ireland tho
samcrule applying in" Canada.sbe
splte intimidation and suppression
of many papers there is still much
feeling shown against England In
the Iilsh press, the following beinc
taken from tho Belfast News:
"At a meeting of the Dublin Cor
poration Alderman Byrne, M. P .
proposed a lesolutlon protesting
against any further taxation of Ire
land. Ho bolleved there was going
to be an attempt to put an addi
tional two millions on Ireland and
that would be put on food sup
plies."
The following Is taken from tho
same paper in a dispatch from
Cork:
"Countess Marclovlcz addressed
a public meeting in the City Hall,
Cork, under the auspices of tho
Sinn Fein party. She said she was
proud that there was today an
irishman in another country who
was making treaties for Ireland
with England's enemies. (Cheers.)
Today the men of Ireland were
alive, and leallzed that the only
way to speak to England was with
guns In their hands. They had
not dared to have conscription in
Ireland becauso the volunteers had
guns in Ireland today. The authori
ties knew they were disloyal and
were afraid of them. They had
seen the letter In the papers from
Mr. Skeffington saying the reason
no Zeppelins had diopped bombs
on Ireland was because they had

In tho Cork Eaxminer there Is a
story of the arrest nnd conviction
of Maik McDonough, a farmer's
son, in Galway, who was arrested
and sentenced to threo months' Im
prisonment for marching a body of
sixty Irish volunteers through a
recruiting meeting there. All of
the witnesses In the case testified
that there was no welcome for tho
recruiting officers in that section.
The same paper tells of the trial
of Thomas Kent, who was arrested
under tho defense of the realm
act for having said:
"I maintain that if the Germans
landed in Ireland tomorow morning
and took It by force of arms, they
would have tho same right to it
as tho English. I have hero be
fore mo two maps, one nearly now,
the other not very old. In the old
I find the names of two small na
tions two Boer republics and In
the new one I can not find any
trace of them. How can England
justify her own words?"
The Dublin Spark, one of tho
papers suppressed recently by tho
British Government, contained tho
following editorial:
"I am putting forward a
policy, but I can see little hopo
for Ireland until the people accept
as a truism the fact that, whether
tho Government of the day be Lib
eral, Tory or Coalition, whether its
Instrument In Ireland 'bo an Aber
deen or a Wimborne, the policy Is
always tho policy of Cromwell. 'In
short, we aro at war with England:
just as much at' war with the Eng
land of today as we wero with the
England of Cromwell s dny, for It is
still Cromwell's England. We
erred when we laid down the weap
ons of war to listen to honeyed
words, for so long as we are con
tent to listen (and wo have proved
good listeners) the honeyed words
will continue, the supply being inexhaustible."
