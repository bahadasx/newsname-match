Von Der Goltz was not in favor with

IS ISL STAND
Chief of Admiralty First to De
pict German Attitude.
His Suggestion of Modification
Tot Acceptable Here.
SEE NO MIDDLE GROUNDS
Von HoItzendorfPs Version Is
Considered Ambiguous.
Would Both Continue Warfare
and Avoid Break.
Washington. April 22. Little hope
that Germany would meet fully the
American submarine demand is ap
parent here today.
Statements of Admiral Von Holtzen
dorff, Germany admiralty staff chief,
given to a press correspondent In Ber
lin, furnished the state department
the first definite line on the German
official attitude.
The conclusion was drawn by some
officials that perhaps modification of
the sternness of the demands offered
the only chance of avoiding a diplo
matic break. Such a modification is
out of the question, they said.
It's Up to Germany Solely.
II is indicated oftcially this gov
ernment will leave to Germany the
question of whether she can conduct
warfare without violating interna
tional law and still make It effective.
Secretary Lansing Is known to feel
that if Germany applies the rules of
visit ami sea rch and provides for
safety of passengers, t he undersea
campaign may be robbed of its de
structiveness and hence its effective
ness. Announcement of the application of
the so-called Mediterranean pledge to
the English death zone probably
would meet America's demands, it is
said in as much as this government
feels these pledges have not been ef
fective If Germany agreed to follow the
visit and search provisions and pro
vide ample safety for passengers.
America may accept it, but Germany
must adhere to her pledges.
Is Germany Heady to Concede?
The problem thus comes down to a
question of whether Germany is ready
for abandonment of her present sub
marine wart which in any event, must
be the first step toward a new policy
and a healing of strained relations.
Authoritit s fee! that the German
admiral's statement is a notification of
a firm position on Germany's part, of
an unwillingness to make her prac
tices square with American demands
At the same time, he apparently de
sires to shift the burden of responsi
bility to the United States, should
there be a break.
The depart ment anticipated today
t hat it soon will have Ambassador
Gerard's official report on the German
attitude.

State Fire Marshal Confession
From Fire Bug Employee.
Chicago. April 2 2. Louis E. Lar
wn, formerly president of the L. E.
Larsen ( ompany, manufacturers of
stencils, is in the custody of the po
lice on charges of having defrauded
insurance companies of thousands of
dollars by arson. The charges grew
out of a fire which destroyed the
Larsen company plant three years
ago. Since that time Larsen has made
his home in Milwaukee, where he or
ganized the Milwaukee Steel Type and
Die company. The plant of this com
pany, according to the state fire mar
shal's office, was destroyed by fire
lat May. Larsen tried to collect $32,
000. An investigation by the fire
marshal's office led to confession on
the part of an employee, who, ac-
! cording to officials, said he was paid
by Larsen to cause the fires.
The fire which destroyed the Chi
cago plant was the fourth of a sus
picious origin in the factory. Accord
ing to the alleged confession of the
employee, the fires were caused by
spontaneous combustion, brought
about by wrapping manila stencils in
tight bundles and placing them under
wooden stencils in various part of the
factory.

hour session of the stock market was

GOL. ROOSEVELT
i MAY MAKE STOP
IN CAPITAL CITY
i Plans to Open Speechmaking
Tour at Kansas City.
i W here He Will Deliver the
j Memorial Day Address.
The Trip May Extend as Far
as Denver.
According to announcements today
from Oyster Bay, it is probable that
Colonel Roosevelt will invade the mid
dle west in late May and early June.
H? has tentatively accepted an invita
tion to deliver a Memorial day address
in Kansas City May 30. In connection
with his western trip it is possible the
colonel may come to Topeka for a
speech. The itinerary will probably
include Denver, Des Moines, Omaha
and other western cities.
In the whirlwind swing of Colonel
Rot.sevelt through the middle west,
politicians see a ninth inning rally of
the colonel's supporters. It is in the
middle west, politicians contend, that
the Roosevelt sentiment is less pro
nounced. None the less his strength
in the Mississippi valley states has
grown rapidly during the last few
weeks. For that reason the coming of
Pioosevelt is recognized as the big
spotlight feature of the pre-convention
campaign.
It is probable that Colonel Roose
velt will conclude his western trip by
arriving in Chicago the morning of
June 7 the day of the opening of the
Republican and Progressive national
conventions. The conjunction of the
Memorial day speech in Kansas City
and the trip through western states is
expected to fire the mine that will set
the middle west ablaze with Roosevelt
enthusiasm. The effect of this trip is
expected to reach the delegates to the
Chicago convention.
Roosevelt Special.
I'lan will doubtless be worked out
for tl running of a Roosevelt special
through Missouri, Kansas, Colorado,
Nebraska and Iowa, with a spectacular
conclusion when the train arrives in
Chicago a few hours in advance of the
big convention. Politicians regard the
proposed trip as vitally significant.
Added importance is attached to the
trip m view of the fact that it will
cover virtually the same terrltorv as
that traveled by President Wilson in
his western trip of last Februarv. The
plan to traJl the president virtually in
sures Topeka a Roosevelt speech' and
will mean a monster Roosevelt demon
stration in Kansas but a few days in
advance of the national convention
Considered solely on the political
side, the Roosevelt advisers frankly
declare their belief that with .he fire
that the colonel will be able to put
into his message to the people of the
middle west and the Mississippi val
ley the demand for his nomination
will spread to such proportions that
the delegates to the convention will
perforce gather in that "heroic mood '
which the colonel himself has said will
be necessary in order to insure his
nomination.
Things Will Move Rapidly.
From now until the meeting of the
convention things will move rapidly
Next Thursday night Colonel Roose
velt will deliver an address on peace
at a banquet in Xew York, given in
honor of delegates to the forthcoming
Methodist conference at Saratoga.
The next day he will leave for Chi
cago, where he will address on the en
suing Saturday night the banquet of
the Illinois state bar association on
preparedness. Both of these addresses,
it is understood, will hit out from the
shoulder on the issues uppermost in
the public mind.
Following the Chicago address, as
the colonel's movements are now plan
ned, he will return to Oyster Bay.
This, however, is subject to change.
Assuming that the Kansas City invi
tation is accepted, he will leave Oyster
Bay again on May 27 for the west. In
Kansas City a monster celebration of
Memorial Day is being planned by
Civil war veterans of both the north
and the south, veterans of the Spanish
war and civic organizations. The in
vitation to the colonel is signed by a
committee of 50 representative citi
zens of Missouri. The opportunity
will enable him to cover practically
the same ground as that which Presi
dent Wilson traveled over on his re
cent preparedness campaign.

Food quality reduced through ark of
appropriations.
Uecurumendationa for revision state
lawa.
In a report sent today to (Governor
Capper. Dr. Lydia A. DeVilbis and Dr.
B. J. Alexander, a former member of
the state board of health, returned the
most blistering arraignment ever di
rected against a state institution. Th
report concerns the Osawatomie state
hospital. Criticism is not directed to
Superintendent Carmichael, but to th
niggardly policies of the state, in the
care of its charitlea.
The members of the committee were
sent to osawatomie by the state board
ot health. Their findings constitute
a condemnation ot the institution and
the policies of the state. Failure to
increase maintenance appropriations
in view of the increased cost ot llwng,
have resulted In a poorer qualit of
tood for inmates. It Is charged Jack
of funds the cutting down of appro
priations by the ll15 house of repre
sentatives under the governor's direction--
have resulted in Insanitary sur-i-oundings
for patients. Further lack
of funds has forced adoption of a rule
w hich compels attendants to work 15
hours a day.
Follows Atchison Report,
Report of conditions at the I sawa
tomle hospital are made b) the samo
committee which recently found de
plorable conditions at tiie state or
phans' home. Atchison. It was fol
lowing this report that Dr. Ailexander
was dropped from the membership
of the state loard of health and a
successor was appointed by the go
ernor. Much Due to "BuiJIiWMJ."
Members of the investigating com
mittee told their story in plain, simple
words. Many of the things which
they recommend were provided in sen
ate appropriation bills during the re
cent session of the legislature, but
were eliminated when the legislatu
deadlocked and forced adoption of the
state administration's "economy" pro-
Tbia is a portion of the story which
the committee today sent to the gov
ernor and the ttate board of control:
"Because of crowded conditions,
one ward in each wing is located in
the basement. On the women s side,
the walls are so damp it is impossible
to keep them plastered, yet human
beings are confined In tiiese wards
and must eat. sleep ami live there.
Only One BftUi Tub.
"The bathing facilities are nowhere
adequate There is one bath tub and
two towels to the wards which con
tain from thirty to fifty patients each.
Bath rooms are supplied with com
mon roller towels, hair brush and
comb for daily use. Many of the
combs were broken and dirty. Many
of these patients are untidy in their
personal habits and require frequent
changing and bathing, so that the
present facilitier, work a hardship
both on patients and attendants.
"Women who suffer from mania
frequently pull their long hair out by
the handfuls and those who suffer
from irritations of the scalp pick and
tear their heads, making it difficult to
cure their condition. It would greatly
simplify matters and promote sanita
tion to cut off long hair of women ex
cept those who are able to care for
themselves.
"The toilet rooms adjoining the
bath rooms are deplorable. The seats
are old. stained and unsanitary. In
many rooms the stench is unbearable
and the odor can be detected many
feet from the door.
"Because of ront inued leaking of
water, the joints are rotting and floors
are nagging. No patchwork will ever
remedy the condition. They need to
be torn out from basement to top
floor and en I i rely new plumbing and
sanitary floors substituted.
Naked Patient Scon.
"Several naked patients were Meen
eon fined in small strong rooms with
the windows open, which was neces
sary because of their untidy habits1,
and no provison for heat. One can
imagine the plight of these unfortu
nates in extremely cold weather.
Dangerous Fire Traps.
"In each wing are front and back
wooden stairways which are dangerous
fire traps. If a fire were to occur in
this main building, it is extremely
doubtful If any considerable number
of patients could be taken out.
"Conditions in the Knapp building
