Held as Robber.
SAYS HE FOUND SATCHEL
Accused Declares He Did Not' Know

(Speeial to The New York ga sad
The Washi=gem Herald.)
Baltimore, Md., April 21.-Postomce in
spectors this afternoon went to Union
Station looking for a man who had
fored a money order. They did not find
him, but instead stumbled into one of
the biggest catches in years-probably
the biggest in the history of Baltimore.
Instead of the forger they picked up,
almost wholly by accident, E. J. Quig
ley, as he stepped from a train from
New York, arrested him and found In
a little black satchel $100,000 in securities
stolen from a mail truck on a New York
ferryboat in February. These securities
are now in a vault in the postoftc.
Quigley is in a cell in the Central Police
Station, held for the Federal authorities,
charged with the robbery.
The loot taken from the satchel is
the remainder of the celebrated $1.00,0$
robbery that startled the country by the
taring of the robbers.
Missing Jewels Also Temme.
By a strange fate Quigley was arrested
in Baltimore only a few bours after
Thomas F. Benson, alias John Bennett.
had been indicted by the Federal grand
fury in New York for alleged complicity
in the robbery. He was arrested while
attempting to pawn jewela ,sai to have
been stolen from one of the pouches,
Four in all were stoke from the mail
truck, two being from Bestn. Nefrous
ness and peculiar actions op thb part of
QulgIey caused his arrest. He was fidgety
Ind casting hurried glances' about the
station when the lnspettators rat
him. He resembled . tly the
they were se ew. Re
and startled' li the action of the insp
ors, started to put up a fight. The odds
were against him, and he was ssen over
& wered. When searched at Postofilce
inspectors' Headquarters a heavy
caliber revolver was found in his hip
pocket. The satchel was then opened
and the securities dumped on the desk.
Says He Found Satchel.
Quigley denied all knowledge of what
the satchel contained. He said he picked
it up upon a train after it had been left
behind by a woman. He said he was
on his way to New Orleans. The ma
jority of the securities, according to the
postoftice inspectors, are from Baltimore
and are negotiable. Quigley explained
his presence in Baltimore by saying he
lesired to see the city. He had no ticket
for New Orleans.
T. R. TO INVADE WEST
BEFORE CONVENTION
Colonel Will Deliver Memorial Day
Address in Kansas City and
May Enlarge Tour.
Oyster Bay. N. Y.. April 21.-Col. Roose
velt will probably make two Invasions of
the Middle West before the Republican
and Progressive national conventions
meet on June 7. Besides his trip to Chi
cago, where he will speak on the evening
of April 29. It is more than likely that he
will go to Kansas City to deliver the
memorial address on Memorial Day, an
invitation to that effect having come to
him today from representative citizens of
that city who are war veterans and mem
bers of civic preparedness and business
organizations.
Of still greater interest. particularly to
the delegates to the Republican conven
tion, is the special invitation that Col.
Roosevelt, after having delivered a pa
triotic sddress in EKana City, might en
iarge the tour to include two or three
other large cities, and then enter Clhi
rcan on the morning of the convention
meetings, while the effect of talks on
preparedness and Americanism was still
fresh in the minds of the Middle West.

n 4-weeks-old Miss Eleanor Axson Wil

For nearly a full hour at least all the

private room of the Jefferson Hospital.
President Wilson spent his whole hour'.

Ifted it up and bounced It on his knees.
to pinched Its chubby cheeks and patted
its chin with its tiny hands. For an
tour he was grandfather altogether, and
maly.
And the baby, as its nurse, Miss Boyer,
ater proclaimed, was on Its very best
iehavior all the time, giving its dlstin
ruished grandfather the tie of his life.
So interested was President Wilson in

with her when Mra Wilson, escorted by

State Department Maintains
that Holiday Should Not
Hold Up Consideration.
GERMANY IS EXPECTED TO
TAKE TIME IN REPLYING
Secretary of State Lansing announced
yesterday afternoon that the American
note demanding that Germany immedi
ately declare and effect an abandonment
of her present methods of submarine
warfare was now officially bfore the
German government.
Ambassador Gerard reported yesterday
that he delivered the note to the Berlin
foreign office at 4:3 o'clock Thursday
afternoon. Ite accompanied his report
with information which Is not encourag
ing.
Germany, it now appears, is not in
clined to take any immediate action one
way or the other on the President's de
mand. The first news that has come
from Berlin indicates that the foreign of
flce will consider the American note at
its convenience, and this Is understoo p
to have made a very bad impression here.
Oicials of the State Department said
yesterday that the German excuse that
no consideration could be given to diplo
matic matters on holidays was a poor
one. I
