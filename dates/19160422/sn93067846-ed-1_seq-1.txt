8. C., at the instigation of Lieut. A. P.
Cronkhlte, United States engineer
corps, who suspected them of espion?
age, according to long distance tele?
phone messages received here from
Lieut. Cronkhlte. A search of the
prisoners' clothing, it was said, re?
vealed the fact that they were in
possession of maps giving minute de?
tails of fortifications and roads along
this section of the coast and carried
an elaborate photographic outfit.
A charge of vagrancy, on which the
men wero taken into custody, was
ohanged to a charge of being sus?
picious characters when each of the
three produced $6,000 to disprove the
vagrant charge.

First battalion, United States engi?
neer corps, has been engaged for sev?

entered into any trust or combination
for the purpose of preventing compe?
tition in insurance rates In this State,
and in declaring that any false state?

I Igel, former secretary .arrested by the

GASOLINE MAY GO (HIGHER.

Bandit's End.
El Paso, April 18.?The reports of
Villa's death were Indirectly confirm?
ed here today by an American min?
ing man who c mtrols large interests
in the Guerrero district. This man
is in close touch with the American
military authorities and has for?
warded his information to Washing?
ton. He said:
"I know beyond any question that
Villa was wounded at Guerrera. I
have received my account of the affair
from one in whom I have the fullest
confidence. Ho tells me that Villa
was shot through the right knee, the
bullet killing his horse, which fell,
pinning the bandit under it and in?
juring his left leg. This was on
March 29. After that I received
dally reports about Villa's movements
up to April 5, when he was at Satevo.
Since then I have heard nothing
about him. Knowing his condition
and the certainty of his being wound?
ed, I consider it highly probable that
he is dead as assuredly he could not
have any proper medical treatment."
