r: MEXICANS MURDER
AMERICAN TROOPER
b.
o' GENERAL FUNSTON ORDERED TO
r TAKE ANY STEP NECESSARY
ir TO PREVENT TROUBLE.
eh
di Washington.--American troops in
l Mexico have had their first battle
with the natives at the moment Gen-!
oral ('arran7a is urging the with
n drawal of the expeditionary force.
n. While General ('arranza's note was
t on its way to Washington, troopers
,t of tne Seventh ('avalry. under 'Major
1 Tompkins, were fired upon in Parral.
k a Villa stronghold, in western Cht
huahua, were pursued to the suburbas
. while the Carranza garrison took a
doubtful part in the affray. The
i, Americans were attacked during the
€, night.
Complete information regarding the
losses to the American troops or to
r, the Mexicans has not reached Wash
It ington. A brief dispatch to the War
., Department said that one American
p cavalryman was toi!ed. The troopers
used a machine gun aca'nst the
, Mexicans.
Secretary Iaker ordered General
r- Funston to take any steps necessary
, to pre.vent further trouble. Asked
- whether this might mean the enforc
a ed use of Mexican railroads, he said
that ;eneral Funston is on the
ground, and will act as any emergen
't cy reqtuires.
v General ('arranza. directing his em
1. bassy here to point out that the c(laih
n proved his contr ntion that the pre-
o ence of American troops in Mexico
e is leading to a situation which threat
ens to go beyond his control, tele
i graphed that many deaths had oc
j curred on Ibot silies.
t Foreign Minister Aguilar in his dis
i patch said one American trooper was
killed and several civilians were
wounded.
(Consul (;artcia. Caranza agent at
E1 E Paso, teti.craphed that "several
persons were killed on both sides."
ills dispatch adldej that x lhen the
S.\American trooper; entered Parral
"the people protested, and it appears
the g;arrison d'd also."
This latter statement is in direct
contradiction to the dispatches of
I ('arranza and Atuilar. whichl declarer?
r the Carranza troops atte mpted to
hold hack the Mexican mobs. A re
port to the State l)tpartm-,nt from
C'onsul Letchter at C'ill luah!ua said
there had been some' "trmluble" at
'Parral when the A,\me-rican column
was fired upon by Mexican civilians.
New Clothes For Troops.
Columbus, N. '1.--American troops 'I
In :Mexico will soon ie equipped with r
new clothing to replace that torn In- I
to shreds in the campaign. A con- o
ienmnient of shoes. liats, uniforms, i
sweaters and other wearing apparel. L'
valued at tl 0-ti.t0. was forwarded ti
south. A quarter of a million dol- 5
lars in .Mexican gold and silver, to
be used in paying the wages of the
soldiers, was also sent south.
