"D'ARTAGNAN."
(Triangle Kay-Bee

Reviewed by Peter Milne.
There »re few who will not re
vel In this Thomas H. lone pro
1 notion Readers of Alexandre
Dumas' "Three Musketeers" will
see it as a pictured Interpretation
of one of the favorite episodes of
the popular classio, while those
who have never heard of Dumas
or the Musketeers will undoubted
ly appreciate it on account of its
delightful uir of advouturo aud
romance.
The reasons of UiIh are many.
To begin with it is laid in France
in the time of Louis XIII, a plane
and a period that was orowded
with adventuro.
Aud D'ArtAgimn, the dauntless
Musketeer in the Queen's service,
is a character molded along lines
that, look iinnsually well on the
screen. Quick with tils sword
and his brain his appearance is a
constant cause for excitement and
thrills.
The three Musketeers are, too
objects of steady admiration, and
lastly, the simplicity of the story
so rich In sustaining powers
stamps "D'Artagnan" as an ex
cclleut picture.
The scenario was written by J
G. Hawke«. He has furnished
an exciting and swiftly moving
story, that embodies the fine
points of the original work, though
it follows merely oue set of char
aoters.
It Is most satisfactory to be
able to state that the introduction
Of these characters is accomplish
ed clearly. Costume productions
tiauaUy make this taot impossible
or else the writers have not been
a bio to meet the situation.
Mr. Hawkea has, for eonfnaion
in the relationship of the charno
tors and in the players them
selves is an unknown quantity in
the offering.
Mr. Hawkea has also paid ovi
deut attention to the sustaining
property of suspense. To furnish
it he has resorted to a very sue
cessful measure—he develops «
strong aud exciting situation to
its climax, which is plotnred in
all Its force, and .then the scene
cuts to soother phase of the story,
leaving the last details of the pre
vioiiR episode to the Imagination
The effect produced is admirable.
Perhaps oredlt for the above
plan of continuity should rest
with Charles Hwtokard, the direc
tor. But at any rate Hwiokard
has carried out this Idea, whoever
the originator, to a degree of per
fection.
Aside from this be has furnish
ed some convincing settings.
Hie street scenes of Paris, and the
mauy interiors of old taverns are
realistio pieces of construction
while the costume is correct and
void of modernism

COMPULSORY
SCHOOL ATTENDANCE.
We have never until now been
ready for compulsory school at
teudanee. During the past twen
ty or more years ou r people have
been busy «treating soutinrent in
favor of the education of the
masses, laying the foundation for
a serviceable public school sys
tem, by providing money for
school purposes, building school
houses, preparing D'aclrer* for
HiicOfiHsfiil teaching, building up
the Btate Univorslty and the In
dustrial schools, organizing a
strong high school system, Und
log out tire kind of instruction
that should lie offered, ami in nu
morons other ways getting ready
to educate all the people. Tills
preliminary work lias been done.
The tnxpayor now believes that
money speut in making the peo
pic law abiding, intelligi-nt and
skillful in their work is a wise
Investment. All of us also be
UoVe that no particular class of
tire people should bo set apart as
the recipients of instruction, but
that all children should lie given
the opportunity to fit themselves
to live and work usefully.
Mueli has boeu done in the de
velopment of our schools. The
story of our progress reads like a
tomanoe. Our people have given
freely of their time and money to
the education of their children,
and because this Is true I am con
vinced that they will no longer
permit a large part of the school
population to be deprived of tire
advantages of schools, nor «ill
they longer suffer the humiliation
of being singled out as one of the
most illiterate states In the Union.
Our illiteracy makes for crime
and disorder and industrial iuefll
orency at home, and it gives us a
reputation abroad that injtir«>s us
beyiod estimation. About 70,000
of our adult whites arc illiterate,
and some 200,000 of our negroes.
With this black cloud of ignor
unco ranging over us we cannot
hope to enjoy the peaoe and bar
mony and prosperity that should
prevail, or to be held in tho high
est esteem by our sister atateH of
the Union. The condition is a
sad one as every patriotic
Louisianian will admit, aud wo
should see to it that no such high
rate of illiteracy shall prevail in
the future. The remedy is com
pulsory school attendance through
the elementary sohool period.
This would mean that all children
would bo guaranteed sufficient
schooling to enable them to read,
write, calculate aud to know
something abont the history, geo
graphy aud government of their
oountry. Should any human be
ing know least Can any common
wealth affoid to give ail its people
least In the absence of onmpulso
ry legislation some school boards
will not provide schools for all
tiie children and some parents
will refuse to have their children
take advantage of the educational
facilities that are provided, and
to meet these situations all civil
feed countries have found it ne
cessary to say by legislation
The Child Bball be Educated."
I think we iu Louisiana are now
ready to take that advantage
step. Of course the question Is
one of money. We are now
spending approximately seven
million dollars a year to support

which says: "Wo favor HiilTioge

was a good stiff endorsement, but
the Democrats of Kansas have
made their position clear by
electing a woman, Mrs. W A

says Mrs, Sylvan!.! Woods, «>f Cllfion Mills, Ky,, In
writing of her experience with Carduf, the woman's
tonic. She sayr. further : "Before I began to use
Cardiff, my back and head would hurt so bad. I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of mv housework. After Inking three bottles
of Cardui, i began to feel like a new woman, i soon
gained 35 pounds, and nmv, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
I wish every suffering woman would give
The Woman's Tonic
a trial. I still use Cardiff when I feel a little bad,
and it always does me good."
Headache, backache, side ache, nervousness,
tired, worn-out feelings, etc., are srure signs of woman
ly trouble. Signs that you need Cardui, the woman's
tonic. You cannot make a mistake in trying Cardui
for your trouhlc. It has been helping weak, ailing
women for more than fifty years.
