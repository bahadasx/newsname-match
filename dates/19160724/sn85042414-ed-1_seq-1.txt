be thrown open to the public and
what promises to be one of the clean
est, most •interesting-and instructive
exhibitions of the fruits of labor, me
chanical skill,' farm husbandry and
modern intelligence will be ready for
public Inspection and enjoyment.
This fair, lnter-state in character

delayed and shown: purses and priz
es aggregating $25,000 have influenc
ed the most successful stockmen, race
horse owners, dare-devil drivers of
autos and high class specialty artists
In coming here. The fair is admitted
ly way ahead of any previous expo
sitions in attractiveness, with the
stock show, while not as large as in
some previous years ranking higher in
the class of entries, a much larger
machinery and auto exhibit, swine,
sheep and poultry exhibits of an un
usually high graJe and as likely a
string of horses as ever faced a start
er to satisfy the rail birds. In the
parlance of the street, "It will be
some fair," and the attendance, judg
ing from, the crowds already in the
city and the reservations made at ho
tels and rooming houses will be all
that the fair management could de
sire.
The free attractions before the
grand stand this year are without
question the cleanest, best and most
spectacular ever offered a North Da
kota public at an exposition of this
kind. Afternoon and evening per
formances will be given, with balloon
ascensions each day. At noon today a
large percentage of all exhibits were
in place, car loads of stock arriving
on morning trains had been trans
ferred to the grounds, race horses,
fresh from victories in other cities
were being worked out preparatory
to the contests of the week, conces
sion owners had about completed the
erection of stands and the placing of
their wares and societies, having at
their responsibility the feeding of the
thousands who will remain at the
grounds during the noon and supper
hours had completed all arrange
ments.
Opening Day.
Tuesday, the opening day will be
as attractive as other days of the
week. The old order, rather disorder
of things in which the opening day at
expositions of this kind was given ov
er more to preparations for the days
to follow, has been done, away with
by the fair management. At the sec
retary's office today, the last details
were being looked to by an efficient
staff of clerks under the direction of
the secretary. The Pike, always at
tractive with its melange" of amuse
ment features, was practically ready
for business' and the big exhibition
halls filled with a splendid showing
of just what North Dakota can do In
different lines of industry. Gate-keep
ers, electric wiring crews, and manag
ers of this or that department were
all on the job and the final word was,
"let every department be ready at 7
a. m. Tuesday."
Pattenon Shows.
The great Patterson shows are
more attractive this year than ever.
If this is possible in the history of
this high class entertainment aggre
gation. Clean, without one objection

oomes to .Grand Forks this tfnsnn to
renew the friendships made in pre

admiring public with his shows.
They carry over S00 people and
twenty-five cars are required to carry
the auxiliaries entering into the suc
cess of their, exposition of animal Ufe,

spectacles. The Battle of Verdun, a

A working model of the Panama
canal, showing the locks and the
passage of ships through this wonder
ful waterway and described by a lec
turer who was one of the engineering
staff when the work on the canal was
in progress, is another educational
feature.
Great Animal Show.
The wild animal show is in truth
a three-ring circus and the biggest
and best attraction of its kind ever
carried by any similar show. This is
a particular hobby with Mr. Patter
son and his assistant, Ray Elder, and
new features have been added to it
making it stand out in a class by It
self and certain to attract young and
old. Those who missed the circus to
day may feel no disappointment, for
the Patterson shows offer them an
equally good opportunity to see ani
mal life in captivity and under the
magnetlsip of skilled trainere, who
have developed in them a wonderful
sagacity and intelligence.
Lady drivers will compete in the
races at the autodrome of the Patter
son shows and the track, instead of
being saucer shaped, is practically on
a level, insuring a straight-away race
thrilling in its nature and develop
ing keenest rivalry among the con
testants.
Grand Forks Day.
Tomorrow being "Grand Forks
Day," it is expected that the attend
ance of local people will be unusually
large and preparations to make this
one of the most interesting days of
the week have been made. There will
be two good races on the program,
the famous Hanklnson Auto Polo
team will compete before the grand
stand in the evening, the Kiltie band,
unlike any other organization catering
to the music-loving ear of the public
will appear in a program before the
grand stand In the afternoon. The
Grand Forks military band will be in
attendance during the entire day and
a snappy vaudeville program given
by clever artists in the evening. The
Pike, Patterson shows, exhibition
halls and quarters are all ready for
public consideration and entertain
ment and a wise suggestion to local
people is, "be there Grand Forks Day
and tell your friends."
The Herald will carry the dally
program, revised by Secretary Moore,
in both evening and morning Issues
and the public advised of any im
portant changes or additions from
day to day. A staff of reporters will
cover the different departments of
the fair and every effort made to
leave no detail of interest forgotten,

THINK ESfAPS)
CONVICTS ARE
Officials Increase Reward
For Four of Escaped
Prisoners.
(Herald Special Service.)
Bismarck, N. D.. July 24.—That the
five escaped convicts still remaining
uncaptured of. the eight who made
their escape from the state peniten
tiary last Saturday, are being assisted
by friends in dr'near the city of Bis
marck, is the: conclusion of officials
of the institution today. This belief
is growing as the search for the
criminals continues without tangible
results. Every possible avenue of es
cape has been guarded, and farm
houses and .buildings of all kinds
within a radius of 75 miles of Bis
marck have-- been thoroughly search
ed- As this- search was made before
tfce. criminals co$tld possibly have, got
ten out of the ariu, sewched,' the of
ficials- are, thereof the opinion
that they befrig'i harbored by
friends in '-Or near Bismarck.
The jail, delivery,-in which they fig
ured, occurred. Saturday, when they
dug through a two-foot-brick wall
with crowbars and Chisels. Three of
them. Alley Pyles, Andrew Schmidt
and Adolph Torneberg, were. captur
ed at midnight near Apple- Creek, a
few miles from the prison.
The rest of the gang seem to have
made good their escape. Two of them
—W.. H. Neavels and Mack McGee—
are believed to be the brains of the
gang. Neavels was at .one time a
guardsman a.t the pen and seems to
Wave-used.-to good advantage the in
side information then learned. The
other, man is a negro. He was held
by the police in Grand Forks for a
time last fall on a charge of assault
and battery. However his victim left
the city without testifying against
McGee, as soon as he recovered suf
ficiently to leave the hospital. Mc
Gee then went to Mohall, N. D., where
he -was apprehended for committing
murder and was sent to the pen for
a life sentence.
In view of the desperate character
of the criminals and the careful plans
which they apparently have laid in
attempting their get-away, officials of
the prison announced today that the
reward offered for the arrest of four
of the five men has been raised from
$50 to $100. Orsag Rudolph is the
only man whom a reward of $50 is
now offered. One hundred dollars
will be paid for the apprehension of
any of the following: W. H. Neavels,
Mack McGee, Thomas Gleason and J.
J. King.

San Francisco, Cal., July 24.—Cn*
der the pressure of public sentimenl
over the bomb explosion during Sat

authorities today are working with
determination to run the perpetrator
to earth. The death list of six, it i*S
