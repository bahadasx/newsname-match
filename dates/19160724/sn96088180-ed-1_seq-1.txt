London, July 24. Six German de

a reconnaissance on the (British coast,
were put to flight by a British sea
force In a running fight off Shouwen
bank Saturday night and early Sun
day, an admiralty statement an
nounced today. The German, ships,
It was said, were repeatedly hit. One
British vessel was struck once, but
the total British casualties were two
wounded. The German destroyers
succeeded In reaching; a base on the
Belgian coast.
The British patrol vessels, charac
terised as light forces Jn the etate
ment, sighted three enemy dirigibles
Saturday midnight near the North
Hinder lighta. The squadron retired
beforl the British cruisers were able
to Inflict any damage on them. Sub
sequently, the admiralty said, sis
enemy destroyers approached and
were engaged by the Brltlah sea
forces In a running fight off Shouwen
bank.
"One of our vessels wss hit once,"
the statement concluded, "and two
of our men were slightly wounded."
The North- Hinder lightship is lo
cated off the Belgian coast between
Ostend and the mouth of the Scheldt
river. Shouwen bank la in the eame
neighborhood. The action which the
admiralty described therefore took
place off the Belgian coast. The Ger

came from Zeebrugge, where there Is
a German destroyer base.

list difficulty will be adjusted," Sena
tor Hoke Smith of Georgia declared
today, after a talk with the presi

either the whole or the major part ot

, Smith has been a leader of the op
position In this country to England's
blockade policies, most of which op
position has been unsuccessful. The
fact that he sees defeat for the pre
sent British plan was regarded as
significant.
"That policy Is so foolish that I
think even Kngland will appreciate
it," said .the aenator.
To other callers, today the presi
dent admitted the blacklist difficulty
"got on his nerves." He Indicated,
however, that the method ofihandltng

8an Francisco, July 24. To run
down the dynamiter whoso hand dealt
death Saturday to six persona and in
jured 86 when a bomb exploded on
Market street during the prepared
ness parade all the energies of the
city of San Francisco were called In
to action today.
Following the announcement by
Mayer Rolph that be would person
ally guarantee a reward of 85.000 for
the apprehension of the criminal,
Chief of Police David White estab
lished a separate and exclusive bu
reau In the detective department de
voted wholly to this case. The new
bureau will continue to exist "as
long as the dynamiter Is at large."
The aid of other large cities whose
police departments have anarchist ex
perts have asked that their detectives
bea informed on anarchistic groups
co-operate with the San Francisco
police. . . ,
San Francisco expressed the belief
today that the dynamiter was an an
archist. Meanwhile the detectives are work
ing on several clues and are still hold
ing Frank osefson, who was detained
Saturday night because of remarks
be was heard to make after the ex
plosion. ., .
The most promising clue was furn
ished by "William Taylor,, an aged
peddler, who said he saw a man
leave a suitcase on the spot where
the bomb exploded at. l':80 p. m.
half an hour before the explosion. He
remarked to the man, he said, that
It waa a poor place to leave his grip,
but the stranger walked hurriedly
away. Taylor was able to give only
a meager description of aim.
The Hat of deaths as the result
of the outrage still remained at six
today, although Miss Pearl Seeman,
whose leg was blown off. and William
Turnbull, whose skull was fractured,
were In a critical condition.
All the lesa seriously injured were

and that the indirect gain, particu
larly In South America, should be
great. It was pointed out that only
'those firms hsvlng direct dealings
.with' the central powers have been
blacklisted and that tbla policy should
remove the fear that there may be
widespread ramifications ot the boy
cott to firms with -only domestic rela
tions with the boycotted concerns.
Since the war first began, .British
officials here said today, a number of
these blacklisted firms have been
maintaining Germany's trade rela
tions with South America. Now, how
ever, since that will be stopped
straight-out American houses will be
able to enter the South American
trade field without. almost any com
petition. It was understood on good author
ity that In so far as the South Amer
ican Issue Is concerned no opposition
to the blacklist Is being met wttb
from several ' large and powerful
banking houses of New York which
have recently gone In for South Amer
ican trade. '
