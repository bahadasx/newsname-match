Would Have Been
Terrible Pile-up
A refrigerator car Jumped the
track in the local yards Friday when
the wheel broke.' Had the accident
occurred on the , Siskiyou grade a
wreck of immense proportions must
have occurred, as the axle turned
crosswise and tore up forty feet of
ties even when the train was moving
slowly In the yards. Had it occurred
an hour sooner when the trains was
on the mountain, the result would
have been a pileup such as has not oc
curred on the Slskiyous In years. The
train had Just pulled Into the yards
and was' opposite the water tank
when the wheel broke. The train was
brought to a stop, oddly enough, Just
opposite the wrecker, which was
standing on a spur. It took the
wrecking crew five hours to repair
the tornup track caused by the rag-i
ging axle. The contents of the car,
peaches, were uninjured.
Injured in Fall
While Icing Cars
While Icing cars on the Ashland
Ice & Storage Company's spur yes
terday, Walter Smith slipped and fell
from the top of a car to the ground,
lighting on his back. His back was
severely strained and at first It was
thought internal Injuries resulted,
bnt according to reports from the doc
tor this morning no serious results
are anticipated.
Steal from Ladies'
Park Concession
Vandals broke Into the concession
maintained by the ladies of the Civic
Improvement Club for the upkeep of
' the children s playgrounds, and stole
j two dollars' worth of confections last
' Wednesday. Shooting would be too
good for the perpetrators of such an
act. Entrance was gained by prying
the hasp off the door. There is no
light in the stand.
Tank Explosion
. Kills Medford Man
The third of a series of fatalities
resulting from the explosion of oxy
gen on the Pacific coast occurred Sat
urday evening at Medford when Jay
Davis, 31 years old, 906 West Elev
enth street, son of Mrs. E. D. Davis,
was almost instantly killed when the
oxygen tank at the Pacific Highway
garage at Medford exploded, driving
a piece of metal Into the young man's
brain.
The other accidents occurred In
San Francisco, when two men were
imej and in Keswick, Cal., where

a part of a motorcycle belonging to

Both Davles and Schnurr were
knocked over, Davles' leg being pep
pered with small particles of metal,
but otherwise both men escaped un
injured. Jay Davis was well known in Med
ford and had a host of friends. He

of exemplary habits and generally
admired and respected. He leaves

Board Gives Graves .
Control of Parks
P. H. Graves was reinstated by the
park board at a meeting held last
Monday afternoon. Mr. Graves was
prevailed upon by the business men
of the city to reconsider his resigna
tion and arbitration of differences
with members of the park board
brought the matter to a happy end
ing. Mr. Graves is now placed In
complete charge of the parks of the
city and the hiring and discharging
of his employes is left entirely in his
charge, he being limited to five men
for the remainder of this year and
obliged to keep within a certain limit
of aggregate salaries. It is fortunate
thpt Mr. Graves was retained, as he
is far too valuable a man to lose over
petty differences.

Rebuild $25,000 Ashland Mine
Mill Destroyed Sunday by Fire
Undaunted by a conflagration
which early Sunday morning de
stroyed the ten-stamp mill, valued at
about V-5'M0. at tIie Ashland mine,
Manager W. A. Bartlett will leave in
the immediate future for New York
city to purchase new machinery and
will have the mine running again as
soon as the mill can be replaced. The
new machinery will be of the latest
design.
The fire which destroyed the mill
started at about 4:30 Sunday morn
ing from an unknown source and Is
believed by Mr. Bartlett to have been
of incendiary origin. The mill was
an immense building built on the side
of a steep mountain, and the flames
starting at the bottom roared up
The Old Resident
Is Set to Thinking
"Good morning. Could you direct
me to the Ashland automobile
j camp?" inquired the driver of the
big Hudson car which rolled to a
stop in the Plaza one day last week.
"Would be glad to," said the old
resident; "I am going up that way
myself," and suiting the action to
the words, he climbed on the running-board
of the car. "Just around
this corner here and turn to your
left."
The car swung around the corner
at a fifteen-mile clip, which the tour
ist naturally falls into on paved
streets, when, bump, bang, and the
occupants shot up against the top of
the car and were thrown violently
back. The driver slowed down, the
passengers held on tightly, but still
the bumps made riding uncomforta
ble and the old resident had to cling
grimly to the side of the car. After
the Perozzi creamery had been passed
the big bumps gave way to little
ditches and washed out places, and
the driver kept his eyes on the road
and tEe passengers were busy arrang
ing themselves wehn the first glimpse
of Lithia Park, the view which should
make the best Impression of all,
swept Into view. Up through the
park, across the bridge and to a stop
in the auto camp, the car itself giv
ing a last contented cough.
The driver climbed out and walked
around the car, looking at the springs
and tires, and finally spoke: "Well,
this is sure some pretty camp and
that park looks good to me, but (or
the love of Mike, what is the Idea of
the bump the bumps for the ap
proach? ' i ', ' '
The old resident passed off the re
mark with some facetious reply, but
as he returned down through the
park het was thinking deeply and
evolved a new Idea, to him at least:
"Why, when Ashland has spent hun
dreds of thousands in building a park
which every outsider enthusiastically
proclaims and every resident ac
knowledges to be Ashland's biggest
single asset, do the people allow it to
be practically locked up by an ap
proach which is enough to keep auto
drivers away?" And then hte
thoughts turning back' to the .last
summer rain when the foot approach
through Chautauqua Park was muddy
enough to make anyone hesitate, he
wondered some more.
Murphy Auto Upsets
On Bailey Hill
When returning with the eiks
from Yreka last Saturday night, the
car belonging to and driven by J. J.
Murphy upset on the famous, or rath
er infamous,' Bailey hill, luckily not
seriously Injuring any of the occu
pants. The Murphy boys and Jim
Bowers were passengers In the car.
Mr. Murphy "killed" the engine in
an attempt to make the grade, which
Is almost straight up and down, on
intermediate gear. The car started
back and the brakes refusing to hold,
Mr. Murphy was obliged to turn "
Into the bank, the car upsetting. Carl
Murphy was thrown clear over the
car, lighting on his face, which bears
the marks of his attempt to smooth
off some of the famous Bailey hill
rocks. Two of the occupants were
pinned under the car, but the top
kept them from being hurt. Assist
ance soon arriving, the cat was right
ed and came on into Ashland, none
the worse except for a badly bent fen
der and smashed windshield.
through the wooden plant, destroy-
Ign it in a brief time despite the
heroic efforts of the men at the mine.
A call was phoned in to the Ashland
fire department, but before a force
could be gathered together the plant
was destroyed. The mill was Insured
with Hillings' agency of Ashland, the
loss being partially covered if not
fully. Practically all the machinery
will he a complete loss.
Mr. Bartlett re-opened the Ashland
mine about two months ago after
years of inactivity and had about
twenty five men employed. He was
well satisfied with the results of the
venture and Is determined to rebuild
and go ahead with the mining as soon
as possible.
Elks Have High
Time at Yreka
A big delegation of local Elks mo
tored over to Yreka Saturday after
noon and enjoyed a smoker and "get
togetlier" with their brethren in
northern California, which from all
reports must have been "some time."
The locals eulogize the Yreka and
northern California members as be
ing entertainers royal and look for
ward to another visit in the not too
distant future. The only mishaps of
the trip which have come to light so
far were when J. J. Murphy's car
upset on Bailey hill and when C. V.
Beeler ran into a calf in the Shasta
River canyon. Most of the party re
turned Saturday night, the rest Sun
day ,
The scenery down the new Faclfic

Lawyer Miles Fails
To Win for Medford
Klamath Falls baseball teasers took
the measure of the Medford team
Sunday by a 7 to 0 score In an Inter
esting game. A big crowd wns pres
ent, many going down from Ashland.
The Klamath contingent came over
In a score of automobiles and backed
their team with much ready cash,
finding few takers down around Med
ford, that town's sports having been
wiped out by the Weed lumberjacks.
The game was, as usual, marred by
the arguing proclivities of Shorty
Miles of the Medford team. Shorty
has the Idea that people come to the
ball park mainly to hear him talk.
Tecnlcally he may be right most of
the time, but the whole world hates
a "crab."
Wade Hampton To
Run Again Sunday
Wade Hampton, famous old run
ning horse belonging to Jim Bowers,

with a northern California horse at
Dorrls a week later for a $1,000
purse.

Deer Make Lithia
Park Their Home
The sight of a beautiful wild deer
grazing in back yards, approaching
within a few feet of residences and
making runways out of the park
paths and drives, Is becoming a com
mon thing in Ashland. Three beau

the north with the Ashland creek
watershed, which is within the forest
reserve, and as a watershed Is also
