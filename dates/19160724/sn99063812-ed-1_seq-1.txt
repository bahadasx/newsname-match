In conference, according to a letter ro-
i el veil this mornlm; from John E. I
Raker, congressman from Northorn'
California. The conferees of the two
houses arc agreed on all tho amend
ments except one proposed by Senator
Hmoot of Iduho. This amendment
reads :
"Provided, That whon there Is no
iccoid of Honlcn or payment for aame

the HorvJco by satisfactory evidence
from the muster rolls on file in the aer
erul stato or territorial archives; and
provided furthor, that the want of a
certificate of discharge shall not de
prive any applicant of tbo benefits of
this act."
This amendment Is proposed because
of the Indian war veterans enlisted
during emergencies, and when theao
wero passed left their companies for
peaceful pursuit without getting a
certificate of discharge. Senator Smoot

Congressman Raker's letter explains
tho stulua of the Indian war penalon
bill. It follews:
"I have yo.uiVof recent date and note
uhat you say in regard to the Indian
war pension bill. As you have been
advised, It has passed both houses, and
Ix now In conference. The conferees
hove agreed upon all the amendments
except tho last one, No. 9. The confer
ees of the house havo agreed upon the
thirty day proposition. I am advised
that the houso will not agree to the
aenate amendment No. 9. I am sending
you a copy of the bill as It psssed the
senate and 1b now in conference, so
you will understand what No. 6 Is.
"If you or any of your friends have
any Influence with Senator Smoot write
him. Tho Western members are doing
all they can to have the conferees
agree. This bill ousht to pass, and
ought not to be held up, but I am afraid
It the senator still Insists upon his
amendment No. 9, tho house conferees
will never agree. I saw the other two
sonnto conferees this morning, and
(hey are willing to agree, but It prac
tically requires unanimous vote before
tho matter can be disposed of. We
will leave nothing undone to get this
conference report out If It can be
done."
