where in the rear of Peronne on the
Somme front, says a dispatch to the
wireless press from Berne, made a
speech to the German wounded sol

Wise Ones
Say Bremen
Is Not lSlear
Norfolk, Va., July 24. Only one of
the allied warships patrolling the Vir
ginia capes waiting for the German
under water liner Deutschland or her
sister ship Bremen, -was in sight early
today, and she was cruising far out to
sea.
Seafaring men who had been expect
ing the arrival of the Bremen within
the last two days now say she cannot
be anywhere near the capes. The
weather during the last 48 hours has
been ideal for a dash into the harbor.
The sea has been rough, the sky has
been overcast almost continually and
rain has been falling. If the big sub
mersible were near, the shipping men
say, she would have taken advantage
of those conditions to come in.
Persons in German circles who pre
dicted the' coming of the Bremen yes
terday admitted their disappointment,
but thought the boat had been delayed
in starting. They recalled that the
Deutschland was more than a week
overdue.
Gold on Deutschland.
Baltimore, Md., July 24. Asked to
day when the German 'merchant sub

return voyage to Germany, Paul G. L.
Hilken, member of the Eastern For
warding company, the boat's Americai.
agency, said she would start "just as
soon as we can get her ready and that
will not be much longer." Hitherto
questions of persons connected with
the Deutschland about her sailing
plans have been met with evasive re
plies or point blank refusals to dis
cuss them.
From a reliable source it was learn
ed today that the Eastern Forwarding
company has closed its negotiations
for a large consignment of gold to be
taken back on the submersible. It
was said the gold will be put aboard
today and that the boat will then be
ready to leave.
Nothing could be learned as to the
amount or from whom it was obtained
except that It was through negotia
tions with "one of the largest Ameri
can banking institutions."

Attendant Says Operation
and Rest Is Necessary
for Villa.
El Paso, Texas, July 24. Only by
the merest chance did Francisco Villa
escape capture when his column was
repulsed by de facto troops in its at
tack upon Parral two weeks ago, ac
cording to a private letter received
j here today from an American in the
I town.
Personally Directed Band.
"Villa personally directed the band
that attacked the city," the letter said.
"He directed the operations from a
carriage about a mile behind the lines.
In this carriage were two women and
a man. When the bandits were push
ed back by the government troops,
they fled past the carriage, stopping
only to provide the chieftain with a
horse on which he made his escape.
The women fled into the brush and
also escaped.
Swiss "urse raptnred.
"A moment or so later the carriage
was seized by Carranzista soldiers and
the man, who proved to be a Swiss
nurse, was captured. In the carriage
were Villa's crutches and several
rolls of bandages. The nurse said that
Villa's wounds necessitated an immed
iate operation and complete rest for
some weeks."
FOREIGN CAPITAL
UNDER NEW RULES
New York, July 24. Radical
changes in laws governing foreigners
doing business in Mexico are about to
be made by General Carranza in a
series of decrees which later will be
included in a new constitution, accord
ing to recent arrivals from Mexico
City.
The new regulations, it is said, will
provide that all foreign investors, be
fore entering business in Mexico must
agree not. to have recourse in any case
to any other" law than that of Mexico
and that they will not be entitled to
I any privileges not enjoyed by Mexi
eans. It will also provide that foreign
j capital already invested in Mexico
, may enjoy the right to be considered
'foreign and be entitled to the protec
ition of its own governmen. until the
I expiration of the concession or agree
ment that it may have entered into
! provided it is not for a very long per
! iod.
Another provision is designed to fix
a uniform period for all the long or
unlimited contracts, leases or conces
sions in which foreign capital is in
terested and that at the end of this
I period they w ill be considered subject
i only to the authority of the Mexican
government and deprived of the right
j of appeal for protection to'their re
i spective governments,
j It is the belief of First Chief Car
jranza and his advisers that these
i measures will suffice to avoid the dan
iger of complications with European
j powers and as a natural sequel will
lift from the I'nited States the respon
sibility of defending the territorial in
tegrity of Mexico against the possbl
i ty of sezure of lands or properties by
!any foreign nation in order to pay the
j claims of t heir nationals.

BLACK LIST ACT
Merchants Will Lay Before Depart

New York, July 24. Merchants
whose foreign trade has been handi
capped by Great Britain through the
circulation of black lists, said todav
that they were collecting a mass of
material to lay before the state de
partment to emphasize a formal pro
test and that their communication to
the federal government probably
would be ready late this week.
By a comparison of experiences,
made now for the first time, local ex
porters say they are able to define the
methods by which the British govern
ment seeks to prevent citizens of the
Teutonic empires from benefitting in
any way from neutral trade. In their
protest they will describe how, in or
der to do any export business with
Great Britain or her colonies or allies,
it was necessary to obtain from the
foreign trade department of the Brit
ish embassy at Washington a "letter
of assurance" which states "as far as
is at present known there would ap
pear to be no objection on the part of
the British government to this con
signment." One exporter said that
before he could obtain such a trade
passport he wrote 20 letters and sent
numerous telegrams to the British em

Senator Hoke Smith, who said he

The president also told callers he

Acute Stage
UponLondon
London, July 21. Premier As
qnith today told John Redmond,
leader of the Irish nationalists in
the house of commons, that the
British government did not pro
pose to Introduce an Irish bill in
regard to which there did not ap
pear to be the prospect of a sub
stantial agreement by all political
parties.
.Mr. Bedmond obtained leave to
move the adjourment of the house
in order to call attention to the
rapidly growing unrest in Ireland
owing to the fact that the govern
ment did not propose to carry out
in entirety the terms submitted for
the temporary settlement.'
London, July 24. An acute state has
been reached in the Irish question. Un
less the situation suddenly changes,
doubt is expressed whether the gov
ernment will be able to introduce an
amending bill this week as has been
promised.
The nationalist members of parlia
ment are holding another meeting to
day, and unless a satisfactory answer
is received from Premier Asquith,
John Redmond, leader of the Irish na
tionalists, will be asked to press him
for a further statement regarding the
intentions of the government. The na
tionalists insist that the bill shall
conform to the terms agreed upon in
the settlement, and they say they will
have nothing to do with the prnporals
to make the exclusion of the province
of Ulster permanent or to reduce the
Irish representation in the imperial
parliament pending final settlement.
London. July 24. Mr. Redmond
asked amid nationalist cheers whether
the government had decided to depart
from the terms of the agreement ar
rived at by the Irish party anil based
upon the proposals made by the sec
retary of war, David Lloyd George,
whether the government had deter
mined to insert in the bill new propos-
I als at variance with the agreement
without consulting the nationalists'
and whether the premier had received
any intimation that a bill so framed
would be vigorously opposed by the
nations lists.
Premier Asquith replied that the
agreement was subject to the appro
val of and revision by the cabinet. Two
main points, he said, had emerged
from the agreement and these had
been accepted by both sections, of the
cabinet, unionnts and home rulers.
The unionists, the premier said, in
fluenced very largely by the attitude
of Mr. Redmond and his friends dur
ing the war. had agreed that home
rule should be brought into immediate
application, while the home rule sec
tion had agreed that the six Ulster
counties should not be brought in
without their consent.
Mr. Redmond repudiated the inter
pretation placed upon the agreement
by Premier Asquith.
