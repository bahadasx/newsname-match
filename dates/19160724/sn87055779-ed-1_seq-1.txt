used to complete the American pro

FEDERAL OFFICIALS
FIND PANIC HARD AS
DISEASE TO FIGHT
Irtern.it lniil News Service:
WASHINGTON. July 24. Federal
officials continue to be greatly alarm
ed over the developments in the In
fantile paralysis epidemic in and
about New York city. The fact that
the physicians of the service, and
those of the New York health de
partment are meeting with determ
ined opposition from parents who
object to the removal of patients tt
hospitals, and from health olficers of
cities and towns throughout the
country, who iunore public health
service certificates, is a serious com
plication. It shows, what the heads of the
public health service have le(n con
fident from the lirst. that a genuine
ttate of panic exists which necessar
ily makes the task of gaining as
cendancy over the disease a hard
one. The number of casts fluctuate
from day to day and otlicials say that
until there is a decided charge irj
the weather all over the east it will
he impossible to make any claims
that the disease is under control.
The chief encouraging factor, so far
as the public health service is con
cerned, is that the spread of the dis
ease throughout the country seems
to have been checked. There have
been seven mild cases yo far re
ported in Washington.

Tntern;itbm.il News Sendee:
LONDON, July 24. P.ntish naval
forces were victorious in a running
tight with German destroyers in the
North sea west of the coast of Hol
land. The scene of the naval en
gagement was off Schouwen bank,
about 4 0 miles northwest of Zee
brugge, the German naval base' in
Pelgiu m.
The olficial report on the battle,
issued by the Rritish admiralty to
day, states that the German craft,
though hit, succeeded in escaping to
the Belgian coast.
The admiralty statement follows:
"At midnight Saturday near
North Hinder light some of our light
forces sighted three enemy destroy
ers who retired before damage was
Inllicted upon them. S lhsequpntly
off Schouwen bank six enemy de-
.M royers were rnpape! in a running"
f.siht and repeatedly hit, but suc
ceeded in reaching the Pelgian
coast. One of our vessels was hit
once.
"An officer and man were slightly
wounded. There was no other dam
age or casualties."
This is the first time that German
naval forces have shown any act
ivity since the Jutland battle. It is
probable that the Teuton vessels en
pam'd and driven from the sea were
a flotilla sent out from Zeebrucge to
prey upon Rritish shipping.
