EXPECTS TO LOWER
INFANT MORTALITY
Health Expert, Despite Pri
vate, Influences, Making
Great Strides.
Unless adverse' influences are
brought to hear in. an effective man
ner, Bridgeport will inever again have
an epidemic that may be traced to
impure milk, 6r insanitary methods in
handling milk. Dr. Abraham Sophlan,
the health expert who is conducting
the city's fight against disease. Is
making plans with the intention that
after a certain date, nothing but pas
teurised milk may' toe sold In Bridge
port,' and no-milk may be vended ex
cept in a sanitary manner. '.'.,"
The ban will be placed rigidly on all
milk, the- quality; of which is uncer
tain, if Dr. Sophian has his way. If
the expert is allowed to work -out hia
plans, , no baby n Bridgeport will be
a victim of germ-laden fluid food.
What this j will mean to . Bridgeport
is testified to by physicians through
out 'the city. Milk from a diseased
animal, milk bottled! in insanitary sur
roundings and milk vended In an in
sanitary manner, takes an annual toll
of likeB , that , is appalling. , The death
certificates show a variety of diseases,
but milk is blamed for much of the' in
fant mortality. .''' '. - '
When JDr. Sophian came to this city
it is understood he soon found' out
what influences are. at work in the
administration and that the health de
partment officials and the mayor are
merely puppets . Those who have ob
served' him in action, however, know
be lias .determined to go ahead, -re
gardless of these influences, with the
knowledge that, if his plans are
blocked, it won't be because he didn't
try.", ,-, x ' . . '-.:..
