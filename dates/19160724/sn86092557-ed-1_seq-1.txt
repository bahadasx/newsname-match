Develops High Speed
EXPECTED THAT LAW-BREAKING
AUTOMOBI LISTS WILL PAY
FOR IT
Tho city's new Indian twin-cylinder
motorcycle which arrived Saturday
evening and which was tried out yes
terday afternoon on the streets, made
a speed of eighty miles a hour. Tho
machine is seven horse power, capa
ble of developing 11. and is electrical
ly lighted throughout. The horn Is
also electrical.
The new "speed killer" will be seen
on the streets henceforth under Police
man Edwards and probably another
cop. There will bo two seats. The
chief of police will very likely ride
around on the roar sent. The city
commissioners figure that the pur
chase of the machine was a good movo
inasmuch as it is expected to pay for
itself within two months by simply
