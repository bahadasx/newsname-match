NEW HOTEL IS
SUBJECT FDR
ARDENT M
CITIZENS OF ARDMORE PLEASED
THAT THEY WILL SOON HAVE
ONE OF THE BEST HOSTELRIES
IN ENTIRE STATE.
Interest in the new hotel has been
revived considerably since the meet
in? Saturday in which permanent of
ficers were selected, and Ardmore cit
izens are congratulating themselves
that an adequate hotel will soon be
erected here, an Institution that has
been needed for some time.
During the great rush for the fields
here a few years ago, it was no un
common thing for every room avail
able in the 'city to be taken, and
many were compelled to take trains
for other places in order to get accom
modation. With the erection of a big
new hotel this will not be repeated
in the future, and there is no good
reason why Ardmore should not be
the headquarters for oil men when the
house Is completed. The Ardmorelte
has a firmly established reputation of
being one of the authentic oil Journals
of the state and the plans for the new
hotel contain provision for perma
nent headquarters for the oil editors
which will be a great convenience to
operators In the field.
Just when work on the building will
begin has not been determined, but
an effort will be made to have the
house ready for opening by the first
of the year.

DEATH.

car 1). McL-aniol, wife of tho prose
cuting atttorney of Buchanan count,
was attacked and beaten as sh lay
asleep in her home hero about mid
night on Friday, July II. She died in
a hospital soon afterwards without re
gaining consciousness. Two children
one five and the other eight years
old were asleep In tho next room,
hut were not disturbed.
I'rosivutur McDanlel iliscovere I hi
wife lying in bed with her head crush
ed by blows from a blunt instrument,
after ho had returned from a trip
down town in answer to what proved
to he a "fake" telephone call. A-i Mr.
McDanlel was nearing home he was
lircd upon from behind a tree, but
was not wounded.
Officials express tho theory that
Mrs. McDanlel was killed by soma
person or persons her liusband Ii-i'I
been active in prosecuting. Mr. Mc
Danlel received several letters just
previous to tho crime. One came
through the mall on July 7. It was
written on stationery of a local hotel,
the letters were printed with a oen
and practically every word was mil
spelled. The writer threatened the)
prosecutor's life and the lives cf
members of his family unless certain
prosecutions were dismissed. Mr. Mc
Danlel is said to have been uneas
about the note. In conversation with
a friend a few hours before the mur
der, Mr. McDanlel said:
"I don't believe anyone who Is cow
ard enough to write that kind of a
etter would have nerve enough to
execute the threat, and yet I am very
uneasy about, it. So much so that I
am not taking nny chances nt all
that I can avoid. Ever since I re.
ceived that letter I havo been carrying
my revolver, and I am especially care
ful If I do go out at night never to
go out alone, and I nm avoiding all
alleys and questionable places. I hava
even thought of having a bodyguard
but decided it was not necessary.
When that story came ott ti ihn nws;
paper aboijf pie receiving that threat
ening letter I cut it out of the paper
so my wife wouidn" see it, as 1 didn't
want her to be worried. But a neigh
bor woman brought the paper to my
house and showed it to my wife in my
absence, and she has beeu very much
excited since."
The night of the murder, Trosecutor
McDanlel attended a lodge meeting
early in the evening. He left the
lodge room, drove arojnd town in his
motor car and, nccordlng to his state,
nient, arrived home about 11 o'clock.
About 11:13 the telephone rang and
he was told that his brother was in
trouble down town. Mr. McDanlel
got into his motor car and went to a
place where ho had been directed. No
one there knew anything of the tele
phone call.
According to the statement of Mr.
McDanlel he arrived home about 13
o'clock. As he alighted from his mo
tor car to open the garage door, soma
one fired at him from behind a tree in
the yard. Mr. McDanlel dropped be
hind his motor car and returned tho
fire. When the chambers of his re
volver had been emptied, he ran Into
the house and to his wife's room.
He found her In bed, unconscious. Mr.
McDanicl called the police.
Two diamond rings taken from the
hand of Mrs. McDanlel, a revolver
and a small amount of money have
not been found.
