that Germany can not be defeated in
an article which appears in today's
Herqlld. Venizelos quotes an interview
given by the king to an Associated
Press representative last January in
which the king declared that the^pr^

lieves In German victory Who today
after the reorganisation of ths Russian
army and the organisation of Kitchen
er's army, by which Bngland Is ralssit

Britain Needs More Money.
Iondon, July 24.—Premier Asqulth
today asked the house of commons lor
a vote of credit of 460,000,000 pound*.
This vote Is the largest asked by the
government since the beginning of the
war and will bring the total voted this
year to 1,050,000,000 pounds, and the to
tal since the beginning of the war to
2,832,000,000 pounds (approximately
$14,160,000,000).
Premier Asqulth made It clear in the
house of commons today that the ap
pointment of a committee to consider
commercial problems after the war,
recently announced, would not Inter
fern with the holding of a larger con
«erence in which the dominions would
take part.
In moving the voting of credit the
premier said the recent expenditure was
approximately 5,000.000 pounds dally.
Thi! 6.000,000 pounds referred to by
Reginald McKenna, the chancellor of
tho exchequer, represented all the out
going, the premier said. All the ex
penditure from April 1 to last Satur
day was 559,000,000 pounds.

UNRiEST IN IRELAND.
Government Appears to Be Side
stepping Temporary Agreoment.
London. July 24.—Premier Asqulth
today told John Redmond, leader of
the Irish nationalists^ that the British
government did not propose to Intro
duce an Irish bill In regard to which
there did not appear to be an agree
ment by all political parties.
Mr. Redmond obtained leave to
move the adjournment of the house In
order "to call attention to the rapidly
growing unrest In Ireland owing to
the fact that the government did not
propose to carry out In entirety the
terms submitted for temporary settle
ment."
Confirming ti.e suspicion that the
cabinet had been unable to reach a
decision. Premier Asquith announced
that the government would not Intro
duce any bill with regard to which
there was no agreement
This was taken to mean that home
rule had been dropped for the moment
and that David Moyd George's nego
tiations had come to naught.
The stumbling block appears to
have been the retention in parliament
of nationalist representatives In un
diminished numbers.
John Redmond moved an adjourn
ment or the house to discuss the
premier's reply and a lively debate
when the regular business of the
house was concluded w*s anticipated.
