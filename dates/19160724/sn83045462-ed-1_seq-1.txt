CAPITAL TRACTION
VMI8,959,393
Public Utilities Commission
Announces Its Tentative
Findings on Properties.
SEPTEMBER 12 ASSIGNED
FOR HEARING ON FIGURES
Should Serious Opposition Develop
Weeks May Be Required Before
Final Decision Is Reached.
The public utilities commission today
made public the tentative valuation
it has established for the properties
of the Capital Traction Company.
Original cost of construction and acquisition
of road, equipment and real
estate now in existence is given at
$10,604,483.SO; reproduction cost, at
$10.^12,271.49. and reproduction cost,
less depreciation, at $S,959,393.88.
September 12 is the date set for the
beginning of hearings on the tentative
figures.
First of Traction Valuations.
This is the first of Washington's big
traction systems to be valued by the
commission. Its ascertainments of the
value of the Washington Railw y and
Electric Company are expectec to be
announced shortly. \
To what extent the company, Vfnch is
capitalized at $18,000,000 ($1i',ooo,?KX) in
capital stock and $6,oOU,ooO in bonds)
will object to the figures is not known.
Should it enter serious opposition, as
has been done by the Potomac Electric
Power Company, weeks may be required
for a hearing on the figures, and
after that the valuation may be tied up
indefinitely by litigation.
Universal transfers and other rate
matters are to be considered after the
street railway company valuations
have been established, but speculation
as to when this may be can be based
on no definite premises.
As the commission now has before
it me power company valuations, iieai
ings on which will be resumed August
7. it purposely advanced the date for
the hearing on the Capital Traction
Company valuation to September 12,
but there is no certainty that it will
be able to proceed very far at that
time.
If the power concern hearings are
still in progress then, it may be decided
to still further postpone consideration
of the railway figures, or it is possible
that alternate sessions will be arranged.
The tentative valuation of the Capital
Traction Company is as of July 14.
1914. Work on the valuation began in
May, 1914. Charles L. Pillsbury, chief
engineer, and Andrew gangster, chief
accountant of the commission, will be
f called upon by the commission to explain
how the valuations were arrived
at when the hearings start.
PARALYSIS EPIDEMIC
NOW ON FIFTH WEEK
Infantile Malady in Hew York Increases

in New Cases.
-\
NEW YORK. July 24.?Another gain in
the number of fatalities and decrease in
the number of new cases was reported by
the health department today, when the
epidemic of infantile paralysis entered its
fifth week. During the twenty-four hours
ending at 10 a.m. today there were thirtyone
deaths and eighty-nine new cases reported
in the greater city, as against
twenty-three deaths and 115 new cases
during the corresponding period yesterday.
New York families who wished to take
their children to summer resorts yester

depend for their outings mainly upon resorts
within the city limit. Fear of infantile
paralysis has caused neighboring
communities to raise their quarantine
bars so high that few New York parents
cared to encounter the severe restrictions.
As a result the crowds at the city
beaches were greater than usual, even
for a Sunday in July. Scarcely any of the
steamboat lines will give assurance of
being able to land New York children in
Connecticut and New Jersey. The activity
of country policemen in stopping motorists
resulted in a decided curtailment of
Sunday motoring excursions.
Great interest was shown today in a
report regarding the epidemic promised
by the committee of the Rockefeller Institute.
which is making a special study
of the disease. Dr. Alvah H. Doty, former
health officer of the port, who is a member
of this committee, said that the committee
tried to learn the manner by
which the disease is communicated and
tnai some remarkable result^ had been
obtained. The health department exj>ects
to receive the committee's report today

DIFFER ON RESULT
OF MOOSE ACTION
Democrats and Republicans
Deeply Interested in Prospective
Developments.
FULFILLMENT OF CLAIMS
IS SEEN BY WILSON MEN
G. 0. P. Regards Outcome of Meeting
as Strengthening Argument Progressive
Party Is Dead.
BY N. 0. MESSENGER.
NEW YORK, July 24.?New
York democratic and republican
managerial circles are deeply interested
in developments expected
to follow Saturday night's progressive
meeting at Syracuse.
It was a fine shindy, well worth
the price of admission to watch
from the other side of the fence,
and the managers are wondering
what the progressives are going
to do next.
The democrats take unction unto
themselves over the outcome and the
outlook and see fulfillment of their
claims that progressives in numbers
will support President Wilson.
The republicans are rubbing their
chins thoughtfully. They are ready
enough with explanations and would
whistle the affair down the wind as
unimportant. Levity aside, however,
the republicans do see the possibility
that the fiasco will be regarded by
thoughtful progressives as so discreditable
that it will strengthen thefr
conclusion that the bull moose party
is a dead one. and will clinch their
support of Hughes.
Bainbridge Colby Pleased.
Bainbridge Colby, leader of the insurgent
progressives who are refusing
to follow Col. Roosevelt and George
Perkins into the republican party, is
pleased. The sore point with him has
been the colonel's claim that the republican
party is now a reunited party.
He has insisted that the progressives
| were a separate political entity and
J could not ^"reunite" with the repubI
licans. Mr. O'Connell is pleased because
he is a former democrat.
I One of the practical considerations at
me iuiure is inai me progressives win
not have any presidential or vice
presidential electors on the ballot, and
progressives will be driven to the alternative
of choosing between Hughes
and Wilson electors or not participating
in the presidential contest.
This phase is regarded by the republicans
as favoring the republican
ticket. They believe that election day
! the great mass of the progressives who
were formerly republicans will vote
the straight republican ticket. Another
angle of the situation is the
likelihood that Saturday night's incident
will serve to encourage the movement
inaugurated by John M. Parker
of Louisiana for another third party
convention to name a presidential
ticket. Revolt among the bull moosers
has broken out in New York, New Jersey,
Massachusetts, Indiana and Michigan,
the bitterness of which was unquestionable,
although the extent was
not demonstrated.
Slight Chance for Third Party.
Mr. Colby, however, although he sees
red when he thinks of the colonel's
abandonment of his flock, is a pretty
level-headed politician and is credited
with expressing the belief that a
third party would not poll 200,000 votes
in the entire nation. He himself is
not yet ready to "go democratic, although
he bucked against having his
; antlers adorn the trophy hall of
i Hughes or his pelt brought in by the
| colonel upon the latter's return to
{ camp. If he votes the republican ticket
it will be because he wants to. and
I not because he is instructed by a committee,
national or state.
One reason believed to have actuated
the Hughes men in adjourning Saturday
night's meeting and allowing indorsement
to go by the board wa.s desire
to deny opportunity to the "antifl"
to get off a lot of speeches in which
they would have further exploited the
"delivery" so-called of the progressive
party to the republicans. It was felt
that the New York meeting would attract
wide attention throughout the
country, and inflammatory speeches
would have aroused and aggravated
bull moosers. who, if left alone, might
in time reconcile themselves to the
old party.
Believe Progressives Are Back.
The republican managers, national
and state, honestly believe that the
mass of the progressives have "come
back" and that they will vote straight
in November. The Hughes managers
would have been gratified to have the
indorsement, but think It might have
been weakened by the further stirring
1 up of the sensibilities of the sensitive
: moose through the vitriolic speeches
! which were set for the occasion as
i soon as debate opened.
The chairman of the progressive com
mute* or me oronx nas recently
completed a poll of enrolled progressives
in his borough. It shows that out
of about 6,700 replies received, 4.500
expressed their intention to vote for
Hughes, about 1,600 will vote for Wilson
and the remainder prefer a moose
candidate.
The republicans are inclined to take
this poll as a fair indication of senticent
among the progressives of the
state.

New Angle Presented to Case on
Report Explosive Was Tossed
From Building.
SAX FRANCISCO, Cal., July
24.?Under the pressure of public
sentiment which has been aroused
over the bomb explosion that
marked Saturday's preparedness
parade here, the authorities today
are working with determination
to apprehend the perpetrator
of the deed. To the death list
of six it is expected that two and
probably more of the forty-four
injured will be added, five of the
victims being reported in a critical
condition.
Led by Mayor Rolph, who has
offprpd a reward of Ss.OOO for the
arrest of the person, and who is
taking an active part in the
search, scores of citizens have
volunteered their services for
personal aid.
A mass meeting to "express an opinion
on the bomb outrage" was called
today for Wednesday by Frederick J.
Koster, president of the chamber of
commerce and chairman of the committee
on law and order which was
appointed recently to deal with the j
longshoreman strike situation.
Clues Being Followed.
Several clues are being followed with j
great activity. Two men who claimed |
to have seen the man with the suitcase.
believed to have contained the in- I
fernal machine, described him as about '
thirty-five years old, tall and shabbily
dressed.
As a result of the conference between
Mayor Rolph and Gov. Hiram W. Johnson
it is regarded as likely that the
state will supplement the city's action
with the offer of a large reward for
the assassin.
A reward of $1,000 has been offered
by the brother of one of the victims.
experts retained oy me ponce nave
arrived at the conclusion, it is said,
that the bomb had as its principal ingredients
nitro-tuluol. This substance,
they say, was compressed into a length
of cast steel pipe, which, judging from
the fragments picked up in the area of
destruction, must have been from a
foot to fifteen inches long and from
six to eight inches in diameter.
Such a bomb, it is stated, could have
been fired, by a time arrangement affixed
to an ordinary alarm clock.
Saw Bomb Fall Into Street.
An entirely new angle to the case was
presented to the police by Dr. J. Mora
Moss, who said that the explosive either
was tossed into the crowd or dropped
from the top of a one-story building at
Market and Steuart streets. Dr. Moss
said he was in Steuart street at the
time, forming in line with the Sons of
the American Revolution, and observed
the bomb falling to the street. He said:
"I happened to turn and saw a black
object, surrounded by smoke, falling
through the air. It was perhaps ten
feet above the ground. It fell among
the crowd and the explosion followed.
I am sure that it was hurled into the
mass of people, and the theory that the
suit case was placed against the corner
building is incorrect."
Frank F. Josefson, the sailor who was
arrested Saturday when he made a
speech at the scene of the explosion in
condonence of the act, is still in custody.

TO SIGN HARBORS BILL
Measure, as Amended, Carries Total
of $42,000,000, Including $3,500,000
for New Projects.
President Wilson will sign the rivers
and harbors appropriation bill, now before
him, it was believed today, although
there have been suggestions
that he might refuse hifc approval of
the measure. At the beginning of the
session of Congress the President conferred
with Representative Sparkman,
chairman of the House committee on
rivers and harbors, and urged that the
appropriation bill for this session of
Congress be entirely shorn of new
projects except one for New York harbor.
reported by naval officials as vitally
necessary.
As reported by the House committee
and passed by the House, the bill
omitted all new projects except the one
mentioned. The Senate, however, added
about $3,500,000 for new projects and,
as passea by both bodies, the bill carried
$2,500,000 more than the House
bill. Representative Sparkman today
explained to the President that the
Senate had raised the bill to the $42,A/iA
AAA urhi/th i f nnur WW.
President did not indicate to his visitor
that he would veto the bill.
The President talked with Senator
Simmons today about rivers and harbors
appropriations for the future, with
the object of trying to bring about coordination
in investigation preceding
appropriations for specific projects. It
is not understood that any legislation
looking toward this will be attempted
at this session, however.
