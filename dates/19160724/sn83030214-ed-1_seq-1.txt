FIVE LOSE LIVES
IN HEAVY SURF
Thousands on the Beach at
Coney and Rockaway
See Bathers Drowned.
The heaviest surf that has broken on
N'ew Vork's beaches this summer, ac
companied by a magnetic undertow, cost
the lives of three bathers at Coney
Island yesterday and of two others at
Rockaway Beach. A sixth man was
drowned in Jamaica Bay when he
atepped into a clam digger's hole.
The dead are:
Abraham Perlin, twenty, of 178 Man?

Coney Island.
Unidentified boy. about eighteen;
droivned at Coney Island.

Four of the drownings were wit
I nessed by the enormous crowds that
' thronjred the shores of both Coney and
' Rockaway. The poliee at Coney esti?
mate that nearly ,".00,000 persons spent
their holiday there ves'. rday and that
in the neighborhood of 15.0,000 of these
went in bathine. The surf at both re?
ports was running unusually strong.
Old dtiltna at Coney declare the under?
tow there was more powerful than has
been known in years.
The most unusual incident of the
day was the death of Wsunkousky.
Hundreds watched the life fruards bnng
' him to shore. He had not lost con
sciousness and walked emiling to his
bathhouse. where he expired while
' changlng his clothing.
At RockawHV young Winkoff got be?
yond the life lines and was being car?

Turning Point Reached,
Allies Firmly Believe
Second Anniversary of the Doomsday of 1914 Finds All
Entente Peoples Certain Their Victory Will Be
"Complete and Absolute."
By J. L. GARVIN.
I Hy (able to The Tribune.)
I_ondon, July 23.?Just two years ago the Austrian ultimatum was
t.ung at Serbia, and the pale horse of the Apocalypse ridden by the Shadow
1 appeared over Kurope to presage the death of millions. The second anni?
versary of that event finds all the peoples of the Great Allianee stamped
Iwith the conviction that their victory will be, as (.eneral Botha puts it,
"complete and absnlute."
To be inspired by so stmng a hope is in itself a power. For the world's
future the struggle, with all its horrors, will have been worth waging.
Morally, we feel already that we have the reward of our waiting. Practi?
cally, no one doubt s now what I ventured to say with decision in The Trib
une's rolumns a fortmght ago?and your correspondent has been anything
but a hasty judge of matters in this war?that the turning point has been
reached.
We have no delusions. We have been too well exercised in disap
pointment and too thoroughly discplined by experience. We know the
stubnorn and bloody process to be passed. We expect that it will take the
better part of a year yet to break up the Central League and secure a
sound reconstruction of the Old World.
Expect Slow, Sure Work.
The Allies have begun this time by reckoning with the worst that may
yet have to be overcome. They have laid thewselves out for slow. sure
work. Hut thev think that well before the third anniversary of the dooms
day of 1914 the terms on which the war must end will have been determined

in history. The Hohenzollern system. no doubt, used that of the Hapsburgs
as an instrument, but when that tool is once broken there can be no hope

BIG SUBMARINE
AWAITS BREMEN
Captain Says Deutschland
Won't Sail Until Sister
Boat Arrives.
.By MaaraaO la Tho fttBSJM 1
Baltimore, July 2.V Captain Koenig.
of the submarine Deutschland, told
friends here .-.-day that he would not
sail until the expected sister sub?
marine, the Bremen, arrived.
It was reported to-day that there had
been stor?*(i on *'ne Peut.cblnnd $4,000,
ono of the gold which the North Ger
nv.n I.loyd liner Prin/.ess Cecile car?
ried when she was interned at Boston
at the beginning of the war. This was
said to account for Paul Hilken's trip
to Boston last week.
One of the mar.y reasons given for
[the delay in tba !"*utsrh!and's da*
i parture is the continued effort by the
I Kastern Forwanling Company to obtain
I insurance on the gold.
Ii.finito information was refused at
the offices of the company as to the
reported .hipment of goU, and It was
intirr.ated th-t the clearance papers
would be issued "within a reasonable
time."
Silence as to Treasure.
"There m,v he Sl00.000 or $4,000,000
in huilion, or not an ounce aboard. It
woold not be policy, you know, to
divulga the cargo list, ' it was jTO*
marked. II wns added th.it rhe
DenUehlaad was running a "strictly
rommereiul" business ard there was no
raaaon to give all the detaiU to th.
.ruhltc. , ...
The real cause for holdmg the un
dtraoa river M long is a jealously
giiarded secret of Paul Hilken. the
bcha-narther < ompanv and the agent<
of the Eaatarn Forwarding 'ompany.
Mr Hilkan, Captain Ilinch and . ap
tain Koenig all betray their anxiety and
tensinn in countenances and move?
ment.. They ara -rorriad, it la appartnt,
over th? non-pcrival of the Bremen,
which. according t<> G.-rman. close to
those direcOy intt-rested in the enter
priao, should hav. arrived at an Amen
ean poll a week ago.
The plan was to have the Bremen
make a ?ensafional dash into N'ew York
or Boston harbor just a week after the
Peutschland's exploit. The projoetora
of the (ierman adventure tigured that
if the Bremen found the Ailies' .ordon
?f warship* too tight off New \ort_ the
Bremen would suhmerge and daih down
the coast and mto the Chesapeake, as
did the I?eutsch!and.
Prefer tn land at New York.
From German sources it is learned
that it is not the compar.y's intention
to let Baltimore get all the "glory"
of the German undersea trade exploit.

BRITAIN REPUES
TOMAILCHARGES
Astonished by Insinuation
in Complaint of American
Company, Says Note.
London, July 24.?The Foreign Office
has published the text of the note
handed to the American Ambassador
replying to American complaints
against the British ca?nsorship of mails.
The reply is eonfined to the few specific
allegations made la the recent Ameri?
can note.
It is stated that the formal answer i
to the general arguments advanced by
the Washington government is still un?
der consideration by the Allied govern
ments and will receive reply in due
course.
The two principal cases referred to
in the present memorandum are those
of the MacNiff Horticultural Company,
of N'ew York, and the Standard I'nder
ground Cable Company, of Pittsburgh.
The MacNiff company complained of
the loss of perishable goods, owing to
the detention by the censor of shipping
documents relatirg thereto.
Special Mail Bag Provided.
The British govprnment states that
so soon as the matter was brought to
its attention it arranged to have a spe?
cial mailbag for shipping papers, which
would be immedia*ely censored, so that
no delay would occur.
In the case of the cable company, it
is stated that "the government of the
I'nited States appeared to insinuate"
that the delay in the mail of the cable
company was directly connected with
the fact "that a Britiah competitor had
obtained a contract for which that com?
pany had bepn tendenng."
"His majesty's government," the no'c
continues, "is astonished that such an
insinuation snoui.i be marie, especially
hs the complaint from the cable com
tany appears not to have been ade
.juateiy examined."
The memorandum goes on to show in
eonsiderable dp'ail that 'endprs for *he
contraets referred to must have naa<e,l
between the I'nited States and Norway
on a date prior to that, upon which the
censorship of Scan.linavian mails
began.
Willing to Eiplain in Detail.
After detailing other cases, the note
continues:
'The speeitie complaintj do not. sup?
port the general chargp against the
efflciency of the British censorship.
. . . His majesty's government will
always be ready to explain in detail the
working of 'hc censorship. as there .

Desperate Struggle Still on for
Positions Won, Lost, Rewon
and Now Partly Held.
KEY TO BAPAUME PRIZE
OF NIGHT AND DAY FIGHT
London Rejoices Over News of Battle
It Hopes Will Finally Pierce
German Line.
By ARTHUR S. DRAPER.
(By Cable to Tho Tribune.)
London. July 2.3.?The Rritish army has struck again after
its two days' wait, driving north and east on a seven-mile front
from the salient before Rapaume. The struggle is still going
on desperately, but the first suecesses are beyond the highest
hopes hold here. Thoy givo promise of vitally4^*nportant de
velopments, and London is rejoioing over tht%#*-'.*-t "news of what
is perhaps to be the biggest battle of the war.
It wa.s after midnight Saturday when the British and ter
, ritorial forces left their lines and charged fieroely all along the
; front from Guillemont to Pozieres. Refore them was the third
'German line, which they had reached before at various points,
only to be driven out again. The Germans defended it with a
desperation equal to their own, and oxoept at the extreme left
the battle has ebbed back and forth for nearly twenty-four
hours without a decision.
At Pozieres, on the extreme west of the lines. the Rritish
success was immediate and spectacular. The Anzar men?the
Australian-New Zealand Army Corps?veterans of the Gallipoli
'struggles, and among the most dashing of the British troops,
swept over what had been considered almost impregnable de?
fences and established themselves in the town. They drove the
Germans from house to house, till they had crossed the main
i Albert-Rapaume highway, and they are now holding it and even
'making some gains against furious German counter attacks.
Battle Still Going On.
To the eastward the attack was less successful. Tho ar?
tiilery had not entirely swept away tho barbed wire entangle
I ments and the troops were checked in the first onset. But they
came on again and drove the Germans through the villages of
Guillemont and Longueval and the Foureaux wood. They were
unable to hold, were driven back, ralliod and again cleared their
front. and were again repulsed. The last reports told of des?
perate hand-to-hand struggles in the ruins of the villages and
in the wood, with every indication that (Jeneral Haig intends to
keep up his fight for the crest of the ridge till he has cleared it.

Paris, July 23. The destruction of
a German fortified work on the Somme
front was marked by a tragic episode,
Ma-n "I.a I.ibort6" The Otdot was
piven to doatrajr the fort at whatever
cost. In less than six hours more
than 1,500 gf*at shells were lired at
it, and the defenos gave way, one by
one, in a cloud of dust and smoke.
The infantry then went forward, and
the (ierman positions were con
quered.
Krench artillery officers, examinmg
the ruins, discovered among a mass of
dehris a Bavanan officer. with his hel

At sight of the French officers the
Bavanan seemed to collect h'-nvlf,
then began to speak softly, the French
men kneeling about him.
The story told by the Bavarian, and
later recounted by an artillery officer,
was to the effect that thirty-two men
had occupied the work. After the
bombardment had continued for a time

awfal death. Two were derapitataad,
and of three others, near whom a shell
exploded, nor a vestigp, remained. Tba
survivors croue'ned ?t the bottom of
the ?uhterranean shelters and awa.ted
their fate.
Another terrific explosion occurred,

TH? Bavanan de'erm.ned r.ot to die
by the hand of hi? chief and scaled
the ruins, clinging to a slope of the
work, only to be buried under a block
of stone. He died soon after the
French officers found him in the hos?
