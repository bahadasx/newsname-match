LONDON, July 24.—Amid a blast of
artillery fire hurled from bis guns,
British forces have advanced still fur
ther in their thrust around Pozieres,
General Sir Douglas Haig reported
today. The fighting is continuing
•with the advantage with the British,
The British commander reported
ithat ground had been gained near the
Jiigh wood of Pozieres.
"We secured important advantages
Jin spite of the enemy's stubborn de
fenses," he stated. "A large portion
of the village is noir ours. We took
two guns and sixty more prisoners."
General Halg said that repeated
German attacks made yesterday be
eenHighWood and Gnlllemont had
n-wititout wiccesl anI--H»*tBrm»h
artillery and machine suns had In
flicted heavy casualties.
Last night was one of comparative
calm, he continued.
Despite Haig*s statement that the
night was "comparatively calm," spe
cial despatches from Paris today de
clared that the battle along Che Guille|
mont-Pozineres line was continuing
and at midnight the British held the
advantage.
'Successful resumption of General
Haig's massed infantry "push" within
the short space of three days after
the Initial effort, had advanced the
^British, lines to within striking dis
tance of the German third line
trenches, brought great satisfaction in
"London today.
Special, dispatches emphasized the
terrific hand-to-hand fighting raging
around Gulllemont. Half of the vil
lage is in British hands, but in the
other half the Teutons are «trongly
dug in and fighting desperately to
hold the ground.
Latest advances, reported In last
night's statement/ were along a five

achieved was at Pozieres—nearly a
mile on the main highway to Bapau

^thrust. Guillamont was apparently
today the most hotly contested spot.

Side by side in the little morgue
here today, lay the body of a man.
24, a wioinan of 22- and a babe of six
months. They all died ef pistol shots,
apparently fired by the man. The
bodies were found early yesterday on
the grounds of the Owentsia club
near here. Two young society girls,
taking an early morning horseback
ride, made the grim discovery.' The
llocal authorities belienred tbiot the
man came from Flint, 'Michigan, as
his hat contained a Flint, Mich.,
dealer's name, and bore the initials,
"L. A. C." Sfcily today the police
bad not received information from
Flint confirming any identification,
but believe that the man had been
employed by the Buick Motor com
pany at Flint.
Hanna Jensen, keeper of a boarding
house, said the three came to "her as
boarders a few days ago. They were
known to her simply as Lloyd, Norma
and Baby Arthur. There was little to
indicate their relationship, but they
Quarreled over the baby, which was
apparen+ly hated by Lloyd.
When the bodies were found, the
nan and woman lay "beside the road,
three feet apart. About twenty feet
away the baby was found. It lied
little clothing on and had been shot
through the head. A .pistol was found
in the mail's hand.

Difficulty With England Over

Adjusted.
J'
ON PRESIDENT'S NERVES
Mr. Wilson Admits That He Has Wor
ried Over the Situa
tion to Some
Extent.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
WASHINGTON, July 24. "The
blacklist difficulty will be adjusted,"
Senator Hoke Smith, of Georgia, de
clared today, after a talk with the
president
"I believe Great Britain will with
draw either the whole or the major
part of this blacklist order," he said.
Smith has been leader of the op
position In this country to England's
blockade policies, most of which op
position has been unsuccessful. The
fact that he sees defeat Hot the pres
ent British plan was regarded as sig
nificant.
"That policy is so foolish that I
think even Great Britain will appre
ciate," said the senator.
To other callers today, the presi
dent admitted the blacklist difficulty
had "got on his nerves." He indicat
ed, however, that the method of
handling it had not been determined.
In British circles today it was de
clared the direct loss in trade by
United States firms will be infinit
ismal and that the Indirect gain, par
ticularly in South America should be
great. It was pointed out that only
those firms "having direct dealings
with the central powers 'have been
blacklisted and that this policy should
remove the fear that there may be
widespread ramifications of the boy
cott to firms with only domestic re
lations with the boycotted concerns.
Since the war first began, Brit
is"h officials here said today, a num
ber of these blacklisted firms have
been maintaining Germany's trado
relations with South America.
Now however since that will be
stopped, straight out American houses
Will be aible to enter the South
American trade field almost without
competition.
It is understood on good authority
that In so far as South American is
sues are concerned, no opposition to
the black list is being met with by
several large banking houses of New
York who recently have gone into
the South American trade.

WASHINGTON, July 24.—The state
department will immediately acknowl

tOWrjOlfr, July 2*4".—^The British sea
patrol squadron drove off a German
raiding destroyer fleet Saturday night,
according to an admiralty statement
today.
The British patrol vessels, charac
terized as "light forces" In the state
ment, sighted three enemy destroyers
Saturday at midnight ne--u- the North
Hinder' lightship. The squadron re
tired before the British cruisers were
able to Inflict any damage on them.
Subsequently, the admiralty said,
six enemy destroyers approached and
were engaged by the Eritish sea
forces in a running fight off Shouwen
Bank. The German ships were re
peatedly hit, it stated, but succeeded
in reaching the Belgian coast.
"One of our vessels was hit once,"
the statement concluded, "and two of
our men were slightly wounded."
Six Driven Off.
LONDON, July 24.—Six German
destroyers, attempting either a raid
or a reconnoissance on the British
coast, were put to flight by a British
sea force in a running fight off Shou
wen Bank Saturday night and early
Sunday, an admiralty statement an
nounced today. The German ships, it
was said, were repeatedly hit. One
British vessel was struck once, but
the total British casualties were two
wounded. The German destroyers suc
ceeded in reaching a base on the
Belgian coast.
The North Hinder lightship is
located off the Belgian coast between
Ostend and the mouth of the Scheldt
river. Shouwen Bank is in the same
neighborhood. The action which the
admiralty describes, therefore, took
place off the Belgian coast. The Ger
man vessels engaged presumably
came from Zeebrugge, where there Is
a German destroyer base.]
Two were Damaged.
LONDON, July 24.—Two of five
German destroyers, presumably those
engaged in the running sea fight off
the Belgian coast Saturday night, re
turned to Zeebrugge with a decided
list, according to Exchange Tele
graph despatches from The Hague
today.
All Returned Undamaged.
BERLIN, July 24.—"Our torpedo
boats returned from a point close to
the mouth of the Thames undamaged
after Sunday's short engagement,"

BELOVED HOOSIER POET
Indianapolis and Greenfield, His
Birthplace, in Rivalry for
His Burla/
Place.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 24.—In
diana bowed today before the bier of
a simple man who, without pretense
or schooling, became its first citizen.
James Whitcomb Riley, interpreter
for Hoosierdom's most Intimate emo
tions, lay dead in his Lockerbie street
home.
Hoosiers generally were inclined to
accept as their own the tribute tele
graphed by Vice President Marshall:
"To live»for humanity so that each
succeeding age will be happier is to
attain immortality. This is the re©
ord of James Whitcomb Riley."
The body of the poet, who died at
his home late Saturday night, will lie
in state in the rotunda of the stata
capitol from 3 p. m. to 9 p. m. today.
The Hoosier poet died at 10:50
o'clock Saturday night, soon after ho
had passed into a peaceful sleep.
Death was due to paralysis. At 7:30
a. m. Saturday, he suffered a violent
stroke, but apparently had recovered
from this. Mr. Riley suffered a vio
lent attack of paralysis in 1910 and
his entire right side was completely
disabled.
Riley -was born October 7, 1849, dy
ing in his sixty-seventh year. The
exact date of his birth was not gen
erally known until after his death,
because the poet for some unknown
reason was sensitive on the matter.
•Hardly had word of Riley's death been
received before Indianapolis and
Greenfield, his birthplace on the Bran
dywine, began a rivalry for the body.
There is a vacant place in the Riley
plot at Park cemetery at Greenfield,
and Greenfield claims that Riley
wished to be buried there, where he
wrote:
"God is His own interpreter,
And He will make plain."
But Indianapolis asserts that pub
lic Seasons favor his burial here. The
board of directors of a large ceme
tery probably will vote today to offer
on behalf of the city, one of the most
beautiful burial sites for the Riley
grave.
Riley's funeral will be held tomor
row and will be private, according to
the wishes of the ipoet. The body
will be placed for the present in a
vault at Crown Hill cemetery here.
Relatives said the body probably
would be finally interred at Crown
•Hill.
