Bombardment Sends Officer
Insane; He Kills His
Own Men in Frenzy.
Paris, France, Jul 21 Details have
been received here of a tragic episode
coincident with the bombardment of a
German fortified work by French ar
tillery, which put 2500 shells into the
fortification In six hours, completely
wrecking it- Then the Infantry went
forward and took over the position.
French artillery officers, examining
the ruins, discovered amid a mass of
debris a Bavarian officer with his chest
crushed and at the point of death. At
sight of the French officers the Bava
rian seemed to collect himself, then be
gan to speak softly, the Frenchmen
kneeling about him.
The story told by the Bavarian and
later recounted by an artillery offi
cer was to the effect that 32 men had
occupied the w ork. After the bombard
ment had continued for a time, half of
the men were victims of an awful
death Two were decapitated and of
three others who were near when a
shell exploded, there remained nothing.
The observers crouched at the bottom
of the subterranean shelter and awaited
their fate.
Another terrific explosion occurred,

sinister glare of the flames the officer
i furiousl) began killing his men, one
-ifter another, until he himself burned
! to death.
The Bavarian determined not to die
