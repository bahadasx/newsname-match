Sheriff Replies.
Office of the Sheriff of Grady County,
Oklahoma. Hodge Bailey, Sheriff.
Chickasha, Okla., July 24, 1916.
Hon, John H. Venahle,
County Attorney,
Chickasha, Okla.
Dear Sir:
I am in receipt of a copy of your let
ter of the 24th, the original of which
I understand has been printed in the
Chickasha Express.
This is the first information I have
had that the District Court denied
the injunction against the so-called
prize fight on the ground it was the
duty of the officers to stop the fight
without any interference by the court.
I do not know that either myself
or my deputies are able to determine
as to whether this proposed exhibition
ia a prize fight prohibited by law or
a boxing exhibition permitted by law.
As sheriff'! do not know where the
line between the two stands. The po
sition of this office on the matter is
that if warrants are placed in my
hands V shall immediately execute
them and I do not think that I shall
need any assistance except that of'
my deputies. I do not anticipate anv 1
violence or trouble in connection with
the service of any character or pro
cess; if warrants are not placed in my
hands I shall instruct my deputies,
who will he at the proposed exhibition
for the purpose of maintaining order,
to arrest without,. warrant all persons
who in their judgment violate the law
in ineir pfesence, whether it be by en
gaging in a so-called prize fight or box.
ing exhibition or by any other unlawful
act. If the matter is left with this
office to either, stop or pormit this et-
hibition, then it will be either stopped j'
or permitted as the judgment of the I
otneers present Rhall dictate, and if
they should determine that persons
there are violating the law I anticipate
no trouble of any kind in arresting
such persona.
As you know, the condition of my
health is such that I can not be pres
ent at this exhibition.
Very truly yours,
HODGE BAILEY.
Sheriff.
County Attorney Apprehensive.
Stop the fight at any cost and go
prepared to meet trouble is the gist
of the request which was made to
Sheriff Hodge Bailey by County Attor
ney Venable, asking the sheriff's of
fice to see that the scheduled bout' at
University Park, does not take place
tomorrow night,, v . f
Following is a 4;opy:of a-.letter which
was addressed to Sheriff Bailey by the
county attorney thin morning:
July 24, 1916.
Mr. Hodge Bailey, Sheriff,
Chickasha; Oklahoma.
Dear Sir:
I take this method of calling your',
attention to the contlmhlated ring or
prize fight or premeditated fight orf
contention (using the language of the
Statute), which is advertised to take
nlace at the University Park near this
city tomorrow ITutuday) eight be-
tween one Texas Tate and Jim Flynn
The district court denied an injunc
tion on The ground that he had no au
thority to grant an Injunction because
there was an adequate remedy at law
In other words that it was within the
powor of and tho duty of the officer
to stop the fight without any interfer
ence by a court of equity. In applying
the remedy at law the only thing that
can be done to stop the fight is to ar
rest tho offenders when they start tho
fight. This may be done with or with
out a warrant; information can not be
filed against ono for the commlowuu
of an offense until tho offense has
beon committed. Therefore it would
not bo posslblo for you 'to have war
rants for tho arrest of the offenders
until after the fight has been terminat
ed ir nearly so at least. Warrants,
however; will be Issued as soon as it
can bo done under the law and placed
In your lands at the 'earliest possible
moment after the fight has proceeded
Information will be filed against the
two participants who engage in the
fight, the two promoters, the two um
pires and the two seconds.
This is the kind of exhibition that
the statute ri'whibits and the great
maBs of the people did not want this
kind of lawlessness in our midst, and
are cuimuonuy looKing lo us, to see
that it does riot take place. In view
of the fact that the mayor of Chicka-ha
has expressed himself publicly as fa
voring this fight and no doubt will not
order the police to assist you in any
way to suppress the fight, I suggest
that you call In all your deputies and
summon other persons, if you think
it necessary to stop this contemplated
violation of the law.
It has been intimated to me that
should you try to interfere with the
fight, resistance would be met, and
trouble would ensue. I hope that noth
ing of the kind will happen but I sug
gest that you be prepared for any emer
gency. '
It. has also been published that j'our
office will in no way interfere with
the! fight without an order of the court.
Am sure that heretofore you nor any
of your deputies have ever failed to
perform your duty and I am sure that
you will not refuse at this time when
a supreme test has arisen. .
Feeling assured that you will do ev
erything in your power to suppress Uie
fight, I beg to remain, ' I
Yours truly,
JOHN H. VENABLE,
County Attorney.
