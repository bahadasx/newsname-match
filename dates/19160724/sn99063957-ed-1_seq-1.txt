RUSSIA!' : CUT THROUGH
GERMniM LIS AT RIGA
Von Hindenberg's Defense, the Strongest the Russians Have
to Face, Successfully Pierced Austrian Resistance
Shattered and Slavs Have Open Road to Northeastern
Galicia and Hungary0n Western Front Allies Make
Important Gains at Pozieres
Petrograd, July 24. Russian armies have blasted and
battered their way through the German line below Riga
and have shattered temporarily the Austrian resistance
to further Russian advance toward northeastern Galicia
and Hungary. Violent German counter attacks northeast
of Kovel have been repulsed. Today a violent artillery
duel was in progress between the forces of General Kuro
patkin and Von Hinderberg along the northeastern most
point of the battle front. .
So far, the censors have yeiled the exact details of
General Kuropatkin's recent coup, but the fact that the
czar's troops have been able successfully to pierce Von
Hindenburg's line considered the strongest to which the
Russians are opposed was hailed here as one of the
striking achievements of the war. Further details today
served to accentuate the extent of the victories of General
Sakharoff along he rivers Lipa and Styr. Apparently his
forces have almost encircled the Teutonic commands of
Generals Boehm-Ermolli and Bothmer, forcing their re
tirement Russian troops now dominate both banks of
the Lipa from the Styr to near Mirkow and in some parts
of the line have thrust forward eight or ten miles beyond
the river. Brody is menaced with an enveloping move
ment."' Southward Russian forces control many of the ap;
proaches to Jablpnitza Pass and have forced retirement
of the Austrians to crests of the hills beyond. Probably
the conflict today is in the pass itself.' Considerable booty
has fallen into the Russians hands and in two days 27,000
men have been captured.
To emphasize Russian successes came full reports to
day of more advances of the Grand Duke Nichols' army
in the Caucasus. The Turks are in full retreat along the
full line toward Ehzingan.
Allies Keep Gaining.
London, July 24. Amid a blast of
artillery fire hurled from big gun 3, Bri
tish forces have advanced still further
in their thrust around Pozieres, Gen
eral Hnig reported today. The fight
ing is continuing with the advantage
with the British.
The British commander reported that
ground had been gained near the high
wood of Pozieres.
"We secured important advantages
in spite of the enemy's stubborn de
fense," he etnted. "A large portion of
the village is now ours. We took two
guns and sixty more prisoners."
General Haig said that repeated Ger
man attacks made yesterday between
High wood and Guillemont had been
without success nud that British artil
lery and machine guns had inflicted
heavy casualties.
Last night was one of comparative
calm, he continued.
Despite Hnig's statement that the
night was "comparatively calm," spe
cial dispatches from Paris today de
clared that the battle along the Guille-mont-Poziercs
line was continuing and
at midnight the British held the ad
vantage. Successful resumption of General
Hnig's massed infantry "push" with
in the short spnee of threo davs. aft
er the initial effort had advanced the
British lines to within striking distance

of the German third line trenches
brought great satisfaction in London to
day.
Special dispatches emphasized the
terrific hand to hand fighting raging
around Guillemont. Half of the village
is in British bauds, but in the other
half the Teutons are strongly dug in
and fighting desperately to hold their
ground.
Latest advances reported in lnt
night's statement was along a five mile
front. The furthermost point achieved
was at Pozieres nearly a mile on the
main highway to Bapauine, the immed
iate objective of the thrust. Guillumont
was apparently today the most hotly
contested spot.
Destroyers Put to Plight.
London, July 24. Six German de
stroyers, attempting eitfier a raid on a
rccon noisance on the British coast were
put to flight- by a British sea force in
a running fight off Showen Bank Silt-
urday night, and early Sunday, an ad
imiralty statement nnnonnced today. The
German ships, it was said, were repeat
I edly hit. One British vessel was struck
once, but the totnl British casualties
I were two wounded. The German de
stroyer succeeded in reaching a base
on the Belginn coast.
The British patrol vessels, character
ized as "light forces" in the state-
1 meat, sighted three enemy destroyers
:-aturuuy at midnight near the north
Hinder lightship. The squadron retired
before the British cruisers were able
to inflict any damage on them.
Subsequently, the admiralty said,,
six enemy destroyers approached and
were engaged by the British sea forces
in a running fight off Mhowen Bank.
"One of our vessels was hit once,"
the statement concluded, "and two of
our men were slightly wounded."
The North Hinder lightship is located
off the Belgian coast between Ostend
and the mouth of the Scheldt river.
Shouwen bank m in the same neighbor
hood. The action which the admiralty
described, therefore, took place off tj)C
Belgian coast. The German vessels en
gaged presumably came from Zeebrugge,
where there is a German destroyer base.
Many Bky Battles.
Paris, July 24. Extraordinary aerial
octivity on both sides of the Greneh
German battle line was reported in the
official communication today. I.une
ville was the object of a German air
raid.
A French aerial raider on Sunday
dropped eight bombs on Con flans sta
tion, and a number of others on build
ings at Dieuze and Vigneulles. Aviator
C'liaput brought down on Sunday his
eighth German aeroplane in a combat
near Fresnes. One other German ma
chine was destroyed near Vaux on the

BLACKLISTING 10 BE
E
Americans Not Hard Hit, But
the Principle Is Just
As Bad
By Robert 3. Bender,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Washington, July 24. "The black
list difficulty will' be adjusted," Sen
ator Hoke Smith of Georgia declared
today after a taU with the president.
"1 believe Great Britain will with
draw either the whole or the major
part of this blacklist order," he said.
Smith has beerr a leader of the op
position in this country to England's
blockade policies most of which oppo
sition has been unsuccessful. The fact
that he sees defeat for the present
British plan wai regarded as signifi
cant. "That policy is so foolish that I
Think even Great Britain will appre
ciate it," said the senator.
To other cullers today the president
admitted the blacklist difficulty "got
on his nerves." He indicated, how
ever, that the method of handling it
had not been determined. .
In British, circles .todav it was de
clared the direct loss in trade by the
united States finiiB will be infmitesi
ami and that the indirect gain, pnrtic
ularly in South America, should be
great. It was pointed out that only
those firms having direct dealings with
the central powers have been black
listed and that this policy should re
move the fear that there may be wide
spread" ramifications of the boycott to
firms with only domestic relations
with the boycotted concerns.
Since the war first began. British
officials here said today a number; ot
these blacklisted firms have been
maintaining Germany's trade relations
with South America. Now. however.
since that will be stopped, straight out
American houses will be able to enter
the South American trade field with
out almost anv competition.
It was understood on good authority
that insofar as the South American is
sue is concerned no opposition to tlie
blacklist is being met with from sev
eral Targe and powerful banking houses
of New York which have recently gone
in for South Aniericnn trade.
Market Irregular
But Prices Stronger
New York, July 24. The New York
Evening fiuancial review today said:
Profit taking and distributive selling
in the first hour, and professional re
covery imparted a good deal of irreg
ularity to the security list in today's
early trading. Tho uncertainty of the
movement was the more disappointing
to the element committed to tLp con
structive side of the account in view
of the generally favorable character of
the news over the Sunday intermission
aird the widespread belief in a highly
satisfactory quarterly report by the
United States Steel corporation. Ac
cording to the current rumor, the lead
ing teel producer will show the larg
est earnings in its history and although
there is no certainty about the matter,
the possibility of tin extra dividend by
way of compensation for payments
omitted last year, is entertained in
some well informed circles.
Activity in U. S. steel overshadowed
all. else in the market at the outset,
and under the influence of strength of
the market leader practically every
thing moved to a higher level. But be
fore the expiration of the first half
hour heavy professional selling checked
the improvement. United Industrial
Alcohol broke sharply and extended its
loss to seven points or so later 011.
Dealings fell away materially after
the first hour ond the market) there
after displayed little or no animation.
Thereafter the market was largely one
of special movements in special issues
and it spoke eloquently of the meager
ness of public participations.
Conditions were little changed in the
late trading and the market lost none
of its professional character. Prices
moved narrowly when at nil. but deal
ings were confined to relatively few
issues.

Saa Francisco, July 24. Hope of ap
prehending the bomb i.'.anter. who tnnfc
a toll of six lives dui:ng the prepared-
ness parade Saturday, centered today
on throe theories:
1 That the maker of infernal ma.-
Chinee was a member of an organized
uu win d Detrayetl by a fellow
conspirator seeking reward money; or,
if he worked out the plan alone! that
the fanatic will become emboldened
and" betray himself. ,
z that, with virtually . every San
Franciscan aiding the police, some in
dividual will come upon, a Valuable
clew. '
3 That the drag net set out by the
bomb squad will obtain information
through one of th many avenues orien
to the police.
rvDt one definite clew is in the
hands of the police, although a mass
of vague informatiou has been' given
ro mem. captain Duncan Matheeou,
head of tho new bomb squad, declared
today that San Francisco police are
facing the most difficult investigation
in their history.
In order to cope- with the situation,
Matheeon has organized hi corps into
three shifts so that -every hour of the
day and nijrht will be covered, lie
sides a big squad of detectives, patrol
men who have distinguished themselv
es as sleuths and a number of govern
ment detecives will aid in the hunt
A group of foreigners, who gather in
the Potrero district, are being closcly
watelied. This group has already pro
dulced one character who recently shot
one policemen and gave battle while
barricaded in a cabin. - ,
The chamber of commerce law and
order committee has suggested the
caning or a mass meeting for Wednes
day uight to enlist tho aid of all San
t-Vanciscans In the search for the guil
ty man or gang.
Chief of Ioliee White, let it be
known today that for more than six
weeks he has been engaged in a search
for persons who sent threats by letter
and post cards to newspapers and
those who promoted the parade. Pos
tal inspectors have been associated
with mm in this work, but their com,'
bined efforts have failed so far.
The threat began to come as soon
as the first plans for the parade were
announced. They were printed out,
anil it is believed were the work ot
the samo persons, although many be
lieve that more than one person was
concerned in Saturday outrage. Most
of the postcards were signed tho Km-
pioyers' liberty league and denounc
ed those behind the parade plan. One
letter, sent to severnl newspapers, was
signed "The Determined Exiles from
Militaristic governments." Tiie threats
were so indefinite that Chief White
said he found it impossible at the time
to forecast when or where an outbreak
would come.
"Saturday plainclothes men were
scattered nil through the crowd watch
ing the iarnde," he said. "Several
were within a hundred feet of where
the bomb exploded. 1 do not believe
the bomb planter intended to explode

Dick Turner Starts Fight and
Is Killed by Police In
Spokane
Spokane, Wash., Julv 24. Pick
Turner, a suspected bandit,, wns fatally
wounded today, and one policeman
seriously hurt in a running fight which
raged for blocks through the Spokane
streets near the Union station. .
Floyd lielvin, the officer, was Bhot
several times. Sheriff Bob Hodge of
Seattle, who happened to be near when
the firing begiyi, chased Turner down
Trent avenue and captured him as he
fell with five bullets in his head and
body.
The battle started when Turner had
words with the crew of a Milwaukee
train on the elevated tracks. Sudden
ly Turner whipped out a. revolver and
began shooting.
Flourishing the gun while men and
women scattered right and left, Turner
then fled along Trent avenue, pursued
by Sheriff Hodge and Patrolmen Fuller
and Clelvin.
Turner was gaining and seemed on
the point of escaping when a police
patrol carrying' several officers- took
up the chase. The fugitive was cor
nered and made a Inst desperate stand,
receiving a bullet in. the back and one
in the head from Fuller's gun and
three bullets frum Oelvin's weapou.
Clelvin dropped from his wounds and
the desperado staggered on a few more
Bteps before being seized by Hodge.
He was rushed to a hospital where
his death is momentarily expected.

Sailors On Big Diver Are
Having Great Time In
Social Way
By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Baltimore, Md., July 24. Everything
pointed lute this afternoon to a dash for
the sea by the German submarine
freighter Peutschland. All the crew's
bedding was taken from the Neokar and
stowed on the submarine: the flat barge
May alongside the submarine -since she
entered the port, m taken away and a
path cleared for a quick dash. In addi
tion the Deutschlaud tested out a Diesel
engine. Terhaps the most significant
thing, however, was the fact that mem
bers of the crew visited German friends
near the waterfront and said they were
leaving tonight for the capes where
they would await the Deutschlaud 's sis
ter ship Bremen.
' Waiting for the Bremen.
Baltimore, Md., July 24. Men con
nected witn the Ozean Bhederei con
fessed todny that they are in tho dark
as to the present whereabout of the
Bremen, sister ship . of the sub-sea
freighter Deutschlaud.
But iu the same breath they declared
they have no reason to believe that she
has met an untimely end and they ex
plained that while he rs--eu route -they
would have no means of tracing her
movements. - -''..
It was recalled that Captain Koenig
announced the Bremen was dus here
"shortly." Officials, however, refused
to reveal anything as to her schedule
time sailing from Germany or time of
arrival here. She is equipped with suf
ficient oil for a month or more of steady
traveling and perhaps, it was said, she
may have found it expedient to Ho sub
merged for longer periods than the
Deutschland did.
It was merely apparent that the lo
cal officeB knew the vessel left Ger
many, but that they are now without
information about her.
The Deutschlaud will await the ar
rival of Bremen, it is stated reliably.
Practically no stevedores worked at the
Deutschl.'nd dock todny; their threat
ened lubor trouble was settled but com
pletion of loading obviated need for
their presence.

Whether clearance has actually been

can firms was pointed out by state de
partment officials today.
The extreme irritation which the ad
ministration sees over England's delay
in answering the mail note is partially
because it was through the alleged il
legal practice of opeuing mail of Amer
ican firms that she obtained much of
tho information on which the blacklist
was compiled.
The preliminary mail reply received
is altogether unsatisfactory because it
ignores the contention of principles ex
pounded in the Americnu note and deals
only with specific enses which have no
imiucdiute bearing on the aeinaim ror a
reform in their practices.
At the state department officials to
dny smiled at stories to the effect that
the government would provide vessels
o convoy merchant ships carrying goods
of blacklisted merchants. "All rot,"

Washington, July 24 Basing her pre

against mail seizures on eight specific,

land in a memorandum delivered here
yesterday and mado public today, as
serts that the incouveniencea charged
are due to a. faulty system that has been
corrected. She cannot assume responsi

the memorandum says.

does say, however, that the principles
involved will be taken up' at a later
day. " i
The note declares only four specif io
instances are cited, and that they ar
in such form that investigation is dif
ficult. It was learned, however, the not
said, that the Macuiff ' Horticultural
company of flew York shipped docu
ments relating to perishable goods on

Rotterdam and the Costeriijk. '..
: These mails,' the note. Admitted,

It was not until February 22, soya
the note, that a formal note complaining
of the mail delays, was received from -tho
American ambassador, stating th
Macniff company anticipated further
difficulties during March.
The note states immediate action has
been taken in all cases where specif io
complaint was made. '
Another caso cited is that ' of the
Standard Underground Cable company
of Pittsburg. The note says Great Bri
tain is "astonished" at an "insinua
tion" that the delay wss directly con
nected with the fact that a British com
petitor obtained a contract for which
that company had been competing. 1
It is contended Great Britain went
out of her way to facilitate the ship
nient from the United states to Nor
way, though it wos mostly cooper
"which might havo been of value to
Germany."
A complaint regarding money order
seizures, the note says, must be left for
consideration in the final reply of th
allied governments "as it involves per
sons of principle on which consultation
among the allied governments is still in
progress."
Regarding the mail from the steamer
Medan the facts as cited by the United
States are substantially correct except
that the neutral mail was forwarded.
