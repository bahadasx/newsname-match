STRIKERS TO SEE
THAT JITNEYS DO
NOT OVERCHARGE
Committee of Union Considers
Measures For Relief of
Public
MAYOR TAKES A HAND
Orders Patrolmen to Arrest
Drivers Who Make Unjust
Fare Demands
A committee from the street car
union is to-day considering measures
for the relief of the public from un
just charges of jitney drivers, the
over-crowding of cars and other mat
ters of the kind complained of. At
the same time that this information
was given to a reporter It was said
the union does not despair of an early
settlement of the strike arse that the
situation to the minds of Chairman
Hugh L. McLaughlin and Vice-Presi
dent Thorpe is nearer a solution than
is apparent on the surface.
The union leaders say they would
like to have the names of all persons
over-charging for jitneys and will en
deavor to protect the public in this
respect. Most of the jitneys are fair,
they believe.
Mayor E. S. Meals issued orders this
morning to Chief of Police J. T. Zeil
to Instruct all of the officers to arrest
jitney drivers who are overcharging
their passengers. An appeal has also
been issued to the passengers who are
overcharged to obtain the license
number of the jitney and report it to
the Chief of Police so that the author
ities can prosecute the owner or
driver of the car.
Arrests to Be Made
Mayor Meals stated emphatically
that overcharging will not be toler
ated He stated that arrests will be
made and fines imposed if the pas
sengers co-operate with the police and
report the license number of the jit
ney so that prosecutions can be
started.
The Mayor explained that because
of the trolleynven's strike he has per
mitted jitneurs to operate autos with
out furnishing the bond and taking
out the license required by ordinance,
but declared that the fares must be
five cents to all points reached by trol
ley cars for that sum.
Vice-President Thorpe, with other
union leaders, this afternoon asked the
passengers of Jitneys when over
charged to report the license number
of the automobile to P. H. Irwin. 527
South Sixteenth street, secretary of the
local division.
Strikers also announced that their
pickets reported that people were be
ing paid by the railways company to
ride on the cars and that the alleged
strike-breakers continue to break
standing rules of the company. New
badges will oe received this evening
for the union men and will be dis
tributed.
At the regular meeting at head
quarters. 26 Xorth Third street, this
afternoon a business sesion was held
and an address made by James H.
Maurer. president of the Pennsylvania
State Federation of Labor.
Two cars crashed together at 6.30
o'clock this morning at Fourth and
Market streets, but no one was injured.
Issues Statement
The Union's committee this after
noon issued the following statement:
The striking carmen appreciate the
aid the jitney service is rendering
them in caring l'or the traveling pub
lic and are earnestly working to se
cure them patronage, but many com
plaints are made that certain drivers
are overcharging passengers which
Mill eventually militate against the
jitneys.
Anv one so overcharged will do us a
favor by securing the license number
ajid name of the driver if possible
and make a brief statement of the
time and place and together with
their own name and address send it
to SECRETARY, CARMEN UXIOX,
527 South Sixteenth street, Harris
burg, Pa.
Strikers Would Arbitrate
The strike situation to-day remained
unchanged. The strikers offer to
arbitrate and demand recognition of
the union and the Harrisburg Rail
ways company officials state that
there is nothing to arbitrate and that
they will not recognize the union.
Twenty-two cars were sent out by
the company on city ana suburban
lines to-day, and service was resumed
to all points except Oberlin, Lingies
towr and Hummelstown.

FRENCH AVIATOR,
OVER BERLIN, BUT
HURLS NO BOMBS
Drops Proclamations Saying
"We Will Not Kill Innocent
Women and Children
CAPTURED IN POLAND
Flies All Night Through Dark-!
ness; Covers 807 Miles;
Spark Plugs Fail
By Associated Press
Paris, July 24. Lieutenant Mar-
Ichal of the French aviation corps, last
month left French soil and flew over
the German capital upon which he
j dropped proclamations and then con
j tinued his flight intending to land
within the Russian lines. He was
' forced to descend, however, in Po
land and was taken prisoner by the
Germans.
j The proclamations dropped by Lieu
tenant Marchal on Berlin stated that
though'it was possible, the aviator re
frained from bombing the open town
and "thus kill the women and inno
, cent children."
Lieutenant Marchal made a circuit
ous flight of about SO* miles, most of
which he traveled in darkness.
The official communication given
out to-day telling of Aviator Marchal's
achievement said:
"On June 20 at 9.30 o'clock in the
evening, Sub-Lieutenant Marchal as
cended at Nancy on board a Nieuport
monoplane of a special type, taking
with him a supply of fuel sufficient to
last 14 hours. His mission was to cross
Germany at a low altitude in order to
drop proclamations on the capital,
Berlin, and then to descend in Russia,
j "This audacious flight was accom
| plished point by point and after flying
! all night Lieutenant Marchal was com
pelled to descend at 8.30 in the morn
ing of June 21 near Chelm. Russian
i Poland, at least 100 kilometres (62
! miles) from the Russian lines. He
■ was made prisoner.
| "The proclamation which Lieuten
ant Marchal dropped on Berlin began
■with the words:
Could Bombard Capital
I '' 'We could bombard the open town
of Berlin and thus will the women and
; innocent children but we are content
i to throw only the following proclama
tion,' etc.
j "Lieutenant Marchal -was interned
at Salrerbach whence he forwarded to
| France a postal card giving these de
tails:
" 'I was made prisoner at 8 o'clock
on the morning of the 21st at Chelm.
The Austrian officers did not believe
! that I had accomplished my task but
| the proof later arrived and they were
obliged to bow to the reality.
" 'lt was the failure of the spark
! plugs which stopped me and I descend
ed to change two of the plugs and to
start the motor again. Unfortunately |
iit would have been necessary to
change two more plugs and at this,
I moment I was taken prisoner. Tou ,
! may judge of my chagrin.'
J "Aviator Marchal in the course of'
his journey covered in continuous j
flight a distance of about 1,300 kilo
metres (SOT miles), most of which he
traveled during the night."
England's Partial Reply
to Trade Interference
Note Is Not Satisfactory
By Associated Press
Washington. D. C-, July 24. Great
Britain's partial reply to the American
note protesting against interference
with neutral mails is regarded by of
ficials as unsatisfactory, principally be
cause it deals with specific cases In
stead of the principles involved. Of
ficials infer from the communication
that Great Britain is determined to up
hold her attitude which the I'niteci
i States regards as unwarranted and
I without authority in international law.
j Acting Secretary Polk said he would

receipt of the British communication

I reply to the last American note. He
said the memorandum would be given

now is before President Wilson.
Nine Auto Owners Held
For Traffic Violations
Nine automobile owners have been
i ordered to appear at police headquar
| ters to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock
| to answer charges of driving around
I overtaken vehicles in the Market street
subway late Saturday and yesterday.
Chief of Police Zeil stated this morn
ing that this will not be tolerated, as
it is a flagrant \iolation of city traffic
rules, and has ordered all officers to
watch for violators and a.-rest them.
On Saturday Alderman James B. De
j shong. committing magistrate at police
hearings this month, fined three vio
j lators $25 for similar offenses. It was
i announced by Chief of Police Zeil that
Alderman Deshong will be in charge
j of hearings during the month of Au
gust also. Several other traffic vio
l lators charged with speeding were
given hearings this afternoon.
E. Wickline, 1209 Mulberry street,
a driver for the Peiffer Line, charged
with obstructing traffic in Market
street this morning, was arrested by
city detectives. He was given a hear
ing this afternoon before Alderman
Deshong.

FLIGHTY BACHELOR MARRIED NOW
Giant Crane Quiets Breath of Scandal Over Unexplained Ab
sence by Going to Housekeeping
Xo longer do Wildwood Lake folks |
worry about the frequent absences of
Rex. the giant crane.
That there was SOME reason was a
foregone conclusion, but Just what it
was didn't develop until yesterday
when Rex. after a week's departure, ,
flew over the trees again and settled
upon the bosom of the lake. With j
him flew the "reason." Plump, grace- i
ful and prettily feathered, SHE stay- j
ed proudly and with a more or less 1
proprietary air, beside Rex. Once or ,
twice the pair rose to fly about the 1
lake together and with them flew '
rumors, thick and rast.
Many a story and near-story has I
been printed about this long-legged
fellow Rex. So far as could be learn
ed he was a bachelor and a confirmed
one. Many a comely wild duck, swan,
etc., wasted their prettiest blandish
ments upon Rex. At ever increasing i
intervals, however, Rex suddenly left |
the lake for parts unknown. His last j
stay was longer than usual. And 1

No Trial For Casement
Before House of Lords
London, July 24.—The Manchester
Guardian says that the attorney gen

certificate to enable Sir Roger Case
ment to appeal to the House of Lords
against his sentence of death.
Sir Frederick E. Smith, the attor
ney general, has intimated to Roger
Casement's solicitors that he is unable
to grant his flat which would enable
Casement's appeal against the death
sentence passed on him for high trea
son in connection with the Dublin re
bellion to be carried to the House of
Lords.
20 DROWN WHEN BO\TS COLLIDE
Copenhagen, via London, July 24.
Twenty persons were drowned when
two ferryboats collided with each other
on the Spree, near Berlin, on Sunday,
according to the Politiken. One of the
boats was sunk.
I when the feathered feminine portion
lof Wildwood saw the lake's most
eligible catch chummily wing his way
home with a stranger, a breath of
scandal followed. But Wildwood's
folks decided to wait awhile; if the
feathered companion that accompan
i ied Rex was a lady, well and good;
■ f she were just the sort of a "mere
i person" at which decent feathered
i people could well turn up their
| beaks, so be it.
Then Rex and his companion hush
jed the breath of scandal. After they
| had fished and lunched together, both
flew to opposite parts of the lake,
i Soon they returned to a common
! meetingplace, each carrying a reed
or stick. So the feathered folk of
Wildwood breathed more freely,
preened and got ready to call. If Rex
should suddenly leave the Lake again
on extended unexplalnable absences,
j it would not be for his friends, but
: for "her" to worry. Rex's visits were
| a mystery no longer, he had been
I married.
