GASES REPORTED
THOMANYSUFFERERS
Estimated That There is at Least 270
Victims in Hubbard, Beltrami
and Koochiching Counties.
PERSONS URGED TO GO TO
LAKE JULIA SANATORIUM
Ten Cases Reported in 1915 and 61
Death Certificates are
Filed.
By Dr. I. J. Murphy.
(Secretary, Minnesota Public Health
Association.)
St. Paul, Minn., July 24.Where
is the best place for Hubbard, Bel
trami and Koochiching county people
who are suffering from tuberculosis
to take the cure? Right in your own
district institution called the Lake
Julia sanatorium, located at Puposky,
near Bemidji.
"Valuable time and unnecessary ex
pense can be saved if patients go to
their home institutions as soon as
there is an available bed," is the ad
vice of Dr. G. W. Beach, superintend
ent of the state sanatorium.
Treat All Alike.
While there is an empty bed, the
Lake Julia sanatorium will receive
Hubbard, Koochiching and Beltrami
county patients and treat all alike
whether they are able to pay or not.
If Hubbard, Koochiching and Bel
trami county people do not take ad
vantage of the opportunity offered
them, patients may be sent to the lo
cal institution from outside counties.
All the other institutions in the state
have a long waiting list. If there
are no patients from the district in
which the institution is located on the
waiting list, patients from outside
counties may be received in their
turn.
Long Waiting list.
The Hubbard, Koochiching and
Beltrami county institution should
not only be filled by Hubbard, Koo
chiching and Beltrami county people,
but if all the cases were known there
would be a long waiting list. People
who have been exposed to tubercul
osis, or have reason to suspect that
they have the disease, should see
their family physician at once. If
they are unable to employ a physic
ian, free examination Will be given
at the sanatorium.
The local institution, which is
supported in part by state and in part
by county funds, was opened several
weeks ago and still has a few vacant
beds. If all the tuberculosis pa
tients of this district avail themselves
of the opportunity under their noses,
the institution would be over
crowded.
270 Patients.
According to Miss Granager of the
Minnesota Public Health association,
who is making a sanitary survey of
the district, there are at least 270
individuals suffering with tubercul
osis in this district at present. A
very small proportion of the cases
have been reported to the state board
of health, in fact, many of the active
cases have not even consulted a phys
ician. During the past two years
there have been on the average more
than 34 deaths from tuberculosis an
nually in this district. It is con
servatively estimated that there are
five times as many living cases in a
community as there are deaths from
the disease. This means that if all
the cases in Hubbard, Koochiching
and Beltrami counties were found
there would be 270 individuals under
treatment in the institution or with
private physicians.
Wait Too Long.
Apparently many people suffering
with tuberculosis who do not consult
a physician until they are near
death's door. Not one-eight of the
deaths have been reported as cases
previous to death. The state board
of health files reval the following for
Hubbard, Koochiching and Bltrami
counties:
In 1914 3 cases were reported and
48 death certificates filed. In 1915
10 cases were reported and 61 death
certificates filed.

(Pioneer Staff Correspondent)
With the Bemidji Naval Militia
aboard the U. S. S. Rhode Island
(Thursday)-In keeping with the
custom of the American navy, gun
drill has been specialized in on the
cruise for the past two days. Such
drills have been organized twice daily
in order .to teach the naval reserves
all the points of good markmanship.
Bemidji has one crack gun crew
on a three-pound gun. Rem Bell,
H. Brown, J. DeRushia, Russell
Brooks and men from other divisions
from the crew. On these drills the
Bemidji militia men occupy all the
eight positions, while others are sta
tioned in the fire control.
Lose Boat Race.
The first whale boat and cutter
race during the cruise was staged
yesterday afternoon. "Andrew Hal
seth was a member of the Rhode
Island's crew, but regardless of this
fact the flagship's crew finished last.
The Kearsage was declared winner.
Swimming call was sounded again
yesterday aftrnoon and as an eve
ning's entertainment movies were
shown. At the performance scores
in the National and American base
ball leagues were announced to the
"tars."
The Rhode Island weighed anchor
for sea maneuvers at six bells and
anchored several buoys, but up to the
present time no action has been ta
ken by the rest of the fleet.
Rival Wash Women.
That the Bemidji "jackies" are liv
ing up to Bemidji's reputation for
cleanliness can be seen by the fact
that none of the Bemidji men have
been placed on the "dirty" squad.
Such a squad is formed every morning
at inspection quarters by those who
appear in dirty uniforms. This is
done to keep the boys doing laundry
work, scrubbing their clothes* Rem
son Bell would make many of Be
midji's washwomen feel cheap.
The mail comes aboard, Lieut. Bar
ker passes around the papers and
Minnesota's fifth division is lost to
everybody for an hour. Everyone
appreciates word from home.

The Last Good-Byes Are Said
6 PERSONS KILLED
WHEN BOMBMS
THROWNINPARADE
Forty Persons Seriously Injured in
San Francisco's Preparedness
Parade.
DEADLIEST INFERNAL
MACHINE EVER INVENTED
Nearly 50,000 Persons in Panic After
Explosion Many Cut and Half
Blinded, if.
San Francisco, July 24.A bomb,
exploded presumably by anarchists in
protests against San Francisco's big
preparedness parade, killed at least
six persons at Stewart and Market
streets and injured 40 seriously, be
sides inflicting lesser injuries upon
scores of others.
The capacity of downtown hospi
tals was taxed to care for victims, but
the parade went on.
Sailor Arrested.
Frank Joseph Finch, a sailor, 46
years old, was arrested in connection
with the outrage. Within a few feet
of the bodies of the victims he made
a stump speech lauding anarchy and
saying, "That is nothing."!
The bomb, one of the dealiest in
fernal machines ever put together,
was left in a suitcase at the corner
and exploded just as the First Cali
fornia regiment was passing the line
of parade getting into full swing.
Bomb in Suitcase.
The bomb consisted of a suitcase
packed with explosives and crammed
with nails, cartridges, slugs and other
missiles, making it more deadly than
the shrapnel of European battlefields.
Pieces hurled a block felled their vic
tims.
Hundreds of persons were gathered
at the corner beside the serried ranks
of the marchers, and the missiles
plowed through them. The building
against which the suitcase had been
left was wrecked, and stores across
the street partly demolished.
Persons cut, half blinded, the blood
streaming from their faces and bodies,
ran madly through the crowd, and
others, panic-stricken, stumbled over
the bodies of the dead and injured,
piling up in heaps on the street.
Newspapers Warned.
Warning that a bomb would be
hurled had been received Saturday by
newspapers an dothers. The close
watch for any move of this kind was
foiled in part by the fact that the
bomb was left in the suitcase instead
of being thrown.
The explosion came as the tragic
climax to the greatest patriotic dem
onstration in the history of the Pa
cific coast.
Nearly 50,000 persons representing
this city, Oakland and all the cities
on both sides of the bay were march
ing up Market street in orderly pro
cession as a living expression of the
marchers in favor of the movement
for national preparedness.
Foot Blown Off.
Half an hour after the head of the
parade had passed Stewart and Mar
ket streets, marching from the Ferry
building, a deafening explosion shat
tered the windows for -several blocks
around anckthrew the spectators and
farchers into a panic.
The bomb had gone off in the thick
est part of the Market street crowd.
Scores of persons were knocked down.
Persons standing on the sidewalk
were heaped in a screaming, yelling
mass.
The foot of one child was torn
completely off and a marcher, carry
ing a big American flag, had the
standard blown from his hand and a
piece driven through his leg.
The wildest confusion prevailed.
Policemen patrolling in the vicinity
of the explosion turned in a hurry
call for ambulances reinforcements
broke through the frantic crowd and
flung a cordon about the place.
Pioneer want ads bring results.
FOUR RED-TOPPED
