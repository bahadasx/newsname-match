Reports Unconfirmed Here But on Good Authority, Says Dis
cussion Extending Oyer Several Months is Moving Toward
Favorable Conclusion Combine Would Remove Rivalry
'.-?;' For Water and Railroad Rights.
Ncsotlatloha ro on between. Li huo Plantation Company of Kauai and
Makee. Sugar Company for tho outright talo of the latter company to Li
.hue, according to news the Star-Bulletin iearna on competent authority. ;
The report U not confirmed by the Lihue agency here, H.JHackfeld &
Company, but white there is a denial that any sale has been made, the Star
Bulletin understands that ths negotiations aro nearer a favorablo consum
mation now than ever before. " -
If the deal goes through, it will be the biggest plantation transaction in
several years. It Involves, moreover, a successful and speedy settlement of
ths water rlghts-rallroad-homestead controversy which stirred Honolulu and v
Kauai a few months ago and which took. Governor Pinkham on his mem
orable viait to the Garden Island. -J ; " '
" There have been "deep down" rumors for some weeks of the big deal,
brewing on the Garden Island. In fact, seme years ago there wae a report
that Lihue might acquire Kealia, as the Makee Sugar Company is generally
known. Later there were reports that ail negotiations were esvered. Then, j
when the governor visited KauaJ in the hope of effecting a settlement of.
the various and bitter controversies, there were rumors that a working
a;reement might be reached, through the territorial government, for the .
handling of water rights, the railroad , problem, and other matters found dif
ficult cf adjustment. v.-. - - '
. it appears that aince the governor's visit, negotiations have been car
rled along with due deilberaUon. A 'meeting of Lihue directors was held
this mcrnlng, but the Star-Bulletin Is Informed that this meeting does not.
Ir,:';cate any definite action looking toward cloelng the deal, though the
s;tu :'.::n mJsht have been talked over by the directors. It may-be weeks
ts.f;re tha deal deflnlUly crystallizes but on good authority it Is said that
there is much hope the transaction will be made. v '-.X0 ;
Plantation men say the deal is a logical and advantageous one to both
parties, as It will remova the commercial rivalry which has led to consid
erable friction, will give the government a railroad from end to end of the
Island and will. effect savings' In crop handUng. " " ' i't r,-;:
- Makes Cu;ar Company is assessed at $154,790 Various figures have'
