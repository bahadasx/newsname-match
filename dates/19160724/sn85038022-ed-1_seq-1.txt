JOHN DARNELL
Captured By Officer Throckmorton
Earl; Sunday Memlng Wanted
Kor t.'rand Larceny.
MWJISTRtTF'S t'OI RT
Officer William Throckmorton early
Sunday ni!. raptured John Dar
nell, who In wanted by the local au
thorities for grand larceny.
Darnell waa In Jail last week on a
charge of boot legging hut MM of hli
I'm mis raised enough money to pay
hla fine and he waa allowed to go
free. Soon after this (leorgc Cum
mins, one of Darnell's pals was cap
tured and held on a charge of boot
legging. Later investigation pointed
to the fact that Cummins had stolen
a number of garments, supposedly
from a freight car. In Police Court
he pled guilty and claimed that he
had no accomplice but things seemed
to point to the complicity of Darnell
A warrant was sworn out and he was
searched for by the police nnd was
soon located by Officer Throckmorton.
When nrrested Darnell did not know
that the police were after liim and
was very easily captured.
The case will be brought up in Po
lice Court today. It may develop that
Darnell was the man who broke open
the car to steal the garments. Cum
mins pled guilty to the charge of lar
ceny but said that he did not break
the car so it must be that he had an
accomplice.
Officer Throckmorton deserves great
credit for his capture as he Is a
much smaller man than Darnell.
Throckmorton is one of the best, men
on the force and by hlg efficient ser
vice almost completely rid the West
Knd of evil doerB. Although he haw
what Is considered aa the wonu ueat,
things are now quiet and he expects
to keep them so.

"The Square Deal tyui"
HORRIBLY MANGLED
Waa Mrs. Bells Thax Inn of Hlggln
port, Ohio, Saturday Nlffht When
she Was fanght 1'nder a
Street Car.
Mrs. Belle Thaxton of Hlgglnsport
Ohio, was horribly Injured early Sat
urday night when attempting to alight
from a car, being caught under It, los
ing her left leg and right foot.
Mrs. Thaxton was visiting her hus
band's sister. Mrs. Ollle Holland of
Beech street fronting January Park
In the Fifth Ward. Saturday she visit
ed some other relatives above the city
and was returning to the Holland
home when the accident occurred.
The lady rang the bell to get
off the car west of Union street
but as she did not ring soon enough
the car went on to the Walnut street
crossing. The car was running very
slowly and Mrs. Thaxton arose before
the car stopped and stepped off. At
this place the car track Is excavated
and there Is a space between the rim
ing board and the edge of tho excava
tion of about six Inches. In some
manner Mrs. Thaxton's feet slipped In
to this hole and her right foot was
caught under the car being cut off
leaving only the heel. Her left leg was
horribly lacerated when caught be
tween the running board and the
edge of the excavation. When
she fell, Mr. Frank Shea caught
her by the arm and held up her
head until the car stopped which was
very soon. Had It not been for this
prompt act she would have probobly
been killed.
As soon as the car stopped, Mrs
Thaxton was removed to the side walk
where her Injuries were examined. It
Vas found that the left leg had been
terribly cut and bruised between the
knee and thigh and the right foot was
mashed. She was not unconscious af
ter the terrible accident and directed
where she should be taken. Drs. Taylor
er and Harover were called and she
was taken to the hospital where her
left leg was amputated.
It Is somewhat of a mystery how
Mrs. Thaxton slipped under the car
since the space Is very small. There was
a large crowd on the car and she wiv
seated in the middle of the seat. When
she arose no one seemed to grasp the
idea that she would get off before
the car stopped and so no effort was
made to detain her.
Mrs. Thaxton lives In Hlgglnsport
and is S3 years of age. She Is the
mother of 11 children, all of whom live
near her.
The accident was the fault of no
one. The car was in charge of Motor-
man George Hunt and Conductor Rich
ardson, but neither of them can be
blamed in the least for the accident.
Just east of Walnut street seems
to be a hoodoo for the Street Car Co.,
as there have been several accidents
at thlB place. Several years ago
young boy was killed by a car within
five yards of where the distressing ac
c'.dent of Saturday night occurred
ii si summer a negro worn,, a fell
from a car near this place and was
slightly injured.

GEORGE CUMMINS
Held Over to the September Term of
the Mason "nitty (irand Jnrr In
Police Court Saturday After
noon on a Charge of
Larceny.
In Police Court Saturday afternoon
George Cummins was held over to the
September term of the Mason County
Grand Jury to be examined for lar
ceny and his bond was placed at $500.
Cummins was arrested several days
hgo by Special Detective Thomas Ste
wart of the C. ft O. and Officer Tolle
having been wanted for some time for
bootlegging. He had caught his foot
under a freight train and had his
large toe on the right foot cut off.
He was lodged In jail and given medi
cal attention.
A short time later Mr Stewart had
occasion to make a visit to a favor
ite congregating place of the bootleg
gers of the West End and found here
a large shipping ease with a number
of garments In it. He then searched
Cummins' rooms and there found a
number of the same kind of garments.
A charge of larceny was placed against
Cummins and an effort was made to
And if the goods had been stolen from
common carrier. Later Investigation
showed that they had been shipped
to the Delaware Garment Co. at Dela
'ware. Ohio, by the Gibson Garment
Co. of this city. This will be a serious
charge against him if the Federal
Grand Jury sees fit to Indict blm as
h was stealing from a car consigned
to another state.
In Police Court Cummins waived ex
amination and pled guilty to the
charge of larceny but said that he
would not plead guilty to the charge
of carbreaking.
