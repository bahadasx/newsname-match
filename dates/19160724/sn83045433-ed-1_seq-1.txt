BRITISH PIERCE
GERMAN LINE ON
FVE-MILE FRONT
Haig Throttles Teuton Coun
ter-Drive and Retains
Initiative in West.
(13 the InternattOnal News Service.)
London, July 2L-British and Australian
troops, by a midnight thrust on a front of
eight miles, between Theivpal and Guille
mont, carried the German outer works for
a stretch of five miles. penetrated into
Poieres and, wheeling around the village.
have driven a wedge across the Rapaume
highroad, between Posiers and Bapaume.
The German defense line between
Posieres and Guillemont bore the brunt
of the attack and it wns there that the
British registered their lergest gains.
More important, however, is the fact
Gen. Haig has forestalled the .German
counter strike, which was in process Of
perpetration. The initiative is still firmly
in the hands of the British.
That the British gains were attended
with heavy losses is indicated in reports
from the German headquarters. In one
place, to the rIght of Potteres, the artil
lery failed to completely level the wire
entanglements erected by the Germans
end the English troops attacking on that
front were subjected to a furious machine
gun fire, which cost them heavily.
Despite these, they succeeded In pene
trating into Guillemont and now hold
sections of the outskirts. In addition,
the British for a time regained complete
control of Longueval. Later they were
forced to cede ground before a strong
German counter-attack.
The gain at Pozieres puts the British
troops beyond the German third line.
They are within two miles of the heights
of Mortinpuich. crest of the plateau.
The Berlin statement says the British
attacks were met with a heavy fire and
suffered severe losses. Berlin concedes
no retirement.
The Central News tonight states that
the British and French, in the three
weeks of their offensive, have taken 6.
23 German prisoners.

Portland, Me., July 2.-Tomorrow's
primary to select candidates for the seat
in the United States Senate, made va
rant by the death of Edwin C. Burleigh,
has failed to create excitement in the
State at large.
The Democrats have no reed of en
thusiasm. for the only aspirant on their
side of the political fence is Kenneth C.
M. Sills, dean of Bowdoin College. The
Republican contest is between former
'overnor Bert M. Fernald and former
Congressman Frank E. Guernsey. A
small vote is expected.
Fernald Is a big favorite, but Guern
sey's chances look good to many. The
geographical argument Is in Guernsey's
favor, for he comes from the eastern
part of the State. which has gone shy
Dn honors for many years. Fernald. how
ever, is better known, and besides has
the advantage of having run second to
Hale in the gubernatorial primaries in
June.
The State election in September is the

'Gen. Herrera, Notably Un
friendly to Americans, Takes
Command at Chihuahua.
(By the international News Service.)
The War Department announced late
yesterday afternoon that Gen. Luis Her
rera has been placed in command of
Carranza's troops in Chihuahua, and that
Gen. Trevino has been recalled to Mexi
co City.
Mittary men see in the announcement a
change of policy by Carranza for the
region near the border.
It is recalled by army officers that the
Herrera faction has not been friendly
to the American government. Herrera
was regarded as the chief obstruction
to the success of the Pershing expedition
and it was by his influence Carranza
first made a demand on the United
States government not to take a step
further southward in Mexico. This de
mand, il Is said, was approved by Gen.
Trevino and Gen. Obregon, but the policy
came from Chihuahua City where Her
rera dominated.
According to all the indications at the
State Department, Carranza has decided
to resume an aggressive policy and to
continue to demand that the administra
tion withdraw the Pershing forces. and
also make a public announcement of the
fact to secure Carranza's tenure of of
fice it Mexico.
Some of the arrmy officers. therefore, see
in the change of front in Sonora a strong
intimation of another threat to the United
States for the sole purpose of coercing
the State Department into submission
to the three demands made upon it by
Carranza.
It was also intimated yesterday that
President Wilson desires to give the
commission to be created larger powers
than Gen. Carranza is willing that it
should have.
