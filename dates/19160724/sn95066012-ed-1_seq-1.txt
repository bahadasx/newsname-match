foro Saturday midnight the British be
gan a new attack on the whole line
from I'ozieres to Oulllemont and tin
fact that Gen Halg has been able to
rtsume the offensive so soon alter the
unsuccessful German counter-attacks
of last week, in which very strong
German forces were brought forward,
is regarded as a good augury.
The lighting has been of the flerceul
character, the Germans working with
their utmost strength to prevent the
lirilish from advancing to their third
line positions. I tut 'When the last re

Australians had Irmly established

Iate last night fighting was proceed

The German counter-attacks re
cently delivered against the French
front have proved equally unsuc
cessful and the allies are now light

from Guillemont.
According to a reliable estimate, the
British and French together have cap

ents, because he is their son; but
"whether he may be proud of them
depends on other things. Bvery state,
l suppose, has something to be proud
of. To the making of each thero went
some toiling courage, some devotion
to high principle, some cheerful sac
rifice for those that should come after
and of these men should be proud.
Hut when we speak with pride of
territory and population, overflowing
harvests, exhaust less mines, luxuri
ous cities, we talk like children,
who are proud of clothes and toys.
What. Vermont has contributed to
the upbuilding of the nation lias been
a favorite theme. Figures have been
arrayed to prove that out of all pro
portion to her size and wealth she has
had her hand in business, in war, in
studies and professions, in the making
and execution of the laws. Her vig
orous blood has made its pulse felt
through all the arteries of the Repub
lic; and it is there you must look to
find the Greater Vermont in our first
century and a uuarter of statehood.
We would not have had it otherwise.
nd yet we cannot help wondering
what Vermont would have been like if
all this energy and intelligence had
been kept at home. Some loss there
might have been. Some never would
tare come to their full stature here
lor lack ol opportunitv. And here at
ome struggle for survival, Yankee
agaiust Yankee, would have been
fierce indeed. Hut when all allow
ances hae been made, who can doubt
that we should have seen here a de
velopment to challange the attention
of the world? Bomathlna like that is
what we dream of for the future. The
cry Is no longer. Westward Ho! but
Vermont for Vermonters. Karnest
