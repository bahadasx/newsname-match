AVIATOR MAKES
DARING FLIGHT
French Lieutenant Leaves
Home Soil, Flies Over Berlin
and Nearly to Russian
Paris, July 24, 12:'30 p. m. Lieu
tenant Marchal of the French avia
tion corps, last month left French soil
and flew over tho German capital,
upon which he dropped proclamations
and then continued his flight, Intend
ing to land within the Russian lines.
He was forced to descend, however,
in Poland and was taken prisoner by
the Germans.
The proclamation dropped by Lieu
tenant Marchal on Berlin stated that,
though It was possible, the aviator re
frained from bombarding the open
town and "thus kill the women and
innocent children."
Lieutenant Marchal made a con
tinuous flight of about 807 miles,
most of which he traveled in dark
ness. The official communication given
out today of Aviator Marchal's
achievement said:
Lieut. Marchal Leaves.
"On June 20, at 9:30 o'clock in the
evening, Sub-Lieutenant Marchal as
cended at Nancy on board a Nleuport
monoplane of a special type, taking
with him a supply of fuel sufficient
to last 14 hours. His mission was to
cross Germany at a low altitude in or
der to drop proclamations on the
capital, Berlin, and then to descend
in Russia.
"This audacious flight was accom
plished point by point and after fly
ing all night, Lieutenant Marchal was
compelled to descend at 8:30 o'clock
in the morning of Juno 21, near
Chelm, 'Russian. Poland, at least 100
kilometers (62 miles) from the Rus
sian lines. He was made prisoner.
"The proclamation which Lieuten
ant Marchal dropped on Berlin began
with the words:
" 'We could bombard the open town
of Berlin and thus kill the women and
innocont children, hut we are content
to throw only the following procla
mation,' etc.
"Lieutenant Marchal was Interned
at Salzerbach, from whence he for
warded to France a postal card these
details:
" 'I was made prisoner at 8 o'clock
on the morning of the 21st. at Chelm.
Austrian officers did not v believe that
I had accomplished my task, but the
proof later arrived and they were
obliged to bow to the reality. "
" 'It was the failure of the spark
plug which stopped me and I desend
ed to change two of the plugs and to
start the motor again. Unfortunately
it would have been necessary to
change two more plugs and at this
moment I was taken prisoner. You
may judge of my chagrin.'
"Aviator Marchal In the course of
his journey covered in continuous
flight a distance of about 1,300 kilo
meters (07 miles) most of which he
traveled during the night "

works. Like a fulfillment of the old saying
"The better the day, the better the
j deed," Ogden is today honoring the
pioneers of Weber county, as perhaps,
they have never been honored in the
progressive city's history. With the
heavens free from the clouds that arc
an augury of storms that sometimes
mar holiday celebrations, appearing
as though an All-Wise Providence was
also interestod in placing conditions
at their best for the pleasure of the
veterans ; who ;Struggled across the
'plalnancf'Yirst broke the virgin soil
of northern Utah's vales, the sun peep
ed with un marred vision over the
mountains shortly after dawn upon a
city in festal attire.
An almost solid mass of American
colors in flags of many sizes and tex
tures and streamers of bunting greet
ed the oyes of the prospective cele
brators as I hey entered the city's busi
ness district, and throughout the city
many residences were also similarly
decorated.
In the city h'all park and along ev
ery street that led to the heart, of the
city, hundreds of persons, decked in
their holiday apparel, were congre
gating. The parade began forming at
Twenty-eighth and Washington befoi'e
S o'clock.
A multitude of moving human be
ings lined the route of the parade.
The sidewalks throughout the busi
ness district was congested. Mounted
patrolmen were kept busy keeping
the children and even older people
from swarming In to the streets, as
there was no room left on the side
w alks.
Thousands of spectators from all
ever the inter-mountain country flock
ed into Ogdon to see the city's trib
ute to the stalwart settlers of Utah.
Over twenty thousands of people wit
nessed the parade.
When automobiles carrying the
aged pioneers passed by they were
greeted with shouts and applause.
One man remarked as the hand cart
company rattled passed. "My mother
walked across the plains with that
company; she was eager to come
down and march today, but she is too
old now; her strength was all spent
in that journey." His eytes filled'
with tears and ho turned" from the
scMie that brought back the suffer
ings of his aged mother.
Attractive Floats.
Hand-carts and the old-time pony
express, drivou by Aaron Ross a
veteren express messenger also at
tracted special attention.
Chief among the floats, descriptive
of Important period in the state's his
tory, was that of the seagulls. This
was of Immense size. On the forward
end was a gigantic papier-mache gull,
and on the rear a large wire cage en
closing a flock of live seagulls, taken
from Bird Island, in the Great Salt
Lake, especially for the occasion. The
float followed a band of children In
the novel' garb of crickets, the whole
bringing to memory the day when the
seagulls saved tho crops of the pio
neers from the ravages of insects.
The Utah State Industrial school
band, preceded the float, "America,"
In which were "Uncle Sam" und "Co
lumbia," represented by Fred G-.. Tay
lor and Miss Oertel Rich. The battle
ship Utah, with a crew of pretty girls
as "middies," also created special at
tention, as did all of the floats in the
foreign section.
Tho agricultural section was of
much interest, being headed by a
number of men carrying scythes, hoes
and old-tlmo hand-rakes. Modern
plows, harrows, mowers and binders
came next in line and, similar to this
evolution in the Improved methods of.
tilling the soil, was that of home
building, m which was shown the In
terior and exterior of ponccr and mod
em homes.
A troop of bov scouts, the Fifth
ward "pioneer" kindergarten float, tho
Beehive girls and their float, created
much attention, while Heber Ccow
croft and a bevy of dainty little maids
in white and occupying a large auto
mobile, advertising tho baby carriage 1
)arade tonight, were greeted with en-
.husiastic applause all along the r
line.
Numerous other features of the pa-!
rade were worthy of special descrip-'
tion and mention, would time and"
space permit, but all in all, the page
ant was the most novel, spectacular
and in every way successful that has
ever been staged in this part of the
state.
The Pageant. '
"All interest during the morning
hours centered in the pageant, which
began to form before 8 o'clock and
which began to move in regular col
umn from Twenty-eighth street and
Washington avenue shortly before 10
o'CiOCk. The parade occupied nearly
one and one-quarter hours in passing
a given point and was nearly three
miles In length.
Headed by a cordon of mounted po- j
lice, cowboys and one division of the
Ogden band, the firsj section com
'prised one hundred and twenty auto
mobiles, in which were the honored
guests of the day, the pioneers near
ly 500 in number and state, city and
officials of different religious denom
inations. Tho Brlgham City band, with Its
lady clai'iuetist, headed the second
and, with due respect to the Pioneer
guests, the most interesting division,
that depicting the history of Utah.
A largo band of Washakie Indians,
including a family in an old "prairie
schooner," eight bucks and throe
squaws on horseback and a family
of five in an old "surrey," followed
the band and then, in succession,
came the trappers, with a float and
pack horses.
The famed "First Company" was
next repi'esented, in replica costumes
of the old days of hardships, traveling
on---foot, '.horseback- and in . dilapidated
prairie schooners.
Then came the Mormon Battalion,
represented by more than a hundred
boy scouts and led by a barefooted
youngster carrying an American flag
that had seen much usage. This
group and the "First Company" cre
ated more enthusiasm among the vast
crowds of onlookers than any other
features of the parade,
Industrial Section.
The portion of the parade depicting
the industrial growth of Ogden and
Utah showed very interestingly the
progress made since 1S47. ,
The Home . Furniture company's
float was a neatly furnished room with
an elaborate ivory bed room set and
one of the fair daughters of Utah
leisurely reposing in one of the rock
ing chairs.
The Utah Cereal Food company had
two squaws mashing the wheat on a
rock showing the old way of making
flour, and ust behind that they had
the finished product as given by the
modern method.
A collision of feeling permeated the
throngs as they turned in the intense
heat and saw three huge blocks of ice
with red letters mado in the middle
of them, spelling the M. L. Jones Ice
company.
Strength and purity inspected by a
representative of, Uncle Sam was the
Ogden Packing and Provision donation
to the parade.
The float of the Amalgamated Su
gar company consisted of a towering
sack of sugar, identical in every re.
spect except size, with the regular
sacks that' are sold.
As an Illustration of the modern
method of constructing buildings was
shown on a float, containing' a mlnia
ture Eccles building.
Cedar trees surrounded with the em
blem of America portrayed the work
that the Forestry Service is doing to
preserve the American forests.
The Smith Grocery company carried
their famous motto, "She is Laying
For You,' on a pioneer cart pulled
by a donkey who was encouraged
along by a bunch of carrots dangling
over Ills' foretop.
The modern and absolete dairies
were pictured by showing the old and
new methods of milking, first by the
hand and the modern and sanitary
way with electricity.
The Weber County Poultry associa.
tion was represented with a float o
chickens.
The electrical float attracted much
attention.
