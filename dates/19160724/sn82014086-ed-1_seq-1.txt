ORANGE BOOK ISSUED
BY DUTCH GOVERNMENT
illustrated Difficulties Which Holland
Has Encountered.
The Hague, Via London, July 23,
11:00 p. in. The long-expected orunye
oook, covering the period from Oc
tober, Ui5 to July of the present year
was issued today It vividly illustrates
the Uiniculties with which Holland has
had to deal, owing to her geographical
.-it uation between the belligerents. The
records show that disputes have arisen
now with Germany and now with
Great Uritain, the progress of which
nas followed witli deepest interest,
not unmixed ith anxiety, by the en
tire Dutch government.
The Grange book lias been delayed
for months in the hope that some set
tlement of the questions at issue would
be reached, but several matters are
still in suspense, it says, and some ap
parently in hopeless deadlock. The
principal of these matters is the sink
ing of the Dutch liner Tubantia, which
is at the same stage that ha d been
reached dune it, when, on the ground
of elaborate technical evidence, Ger
many declared the incident closed
that no German warship had sunk the
Tubantia and insisted that it was
closed, that no German warship had
sunk the Tubantia and insisted that it
was likely that a toier.od which had
been previously fired at a British war
ship had remained afloat and come in
contact with the liner.
This portion of the Orange book a
footnote by the Dutch government
adds that Holland maintains its pre
vious attitude that a German torpedo
sank tlie TubPiitia and says the Dutch
government has determined to leave
nothing undone to obtain additional
light on the matter and lias asked
further information . from Germany
v.atii which confidential con vernations
are now proceeding.

GREAT BRITAIN READY
TO EXPLAIN CENSORSHIP.
Note Handed to American Ambassador
Replying to Complaints.
London. July 24, 1.42 a.m. The for
eign office has published the text of
the note handed to the American am
bassador replying to certain American
complaints against the British censor
ship of malls. The reply is confined
to the few specific allegations made
in the recent American note. It is
stated that the formal answer to the
general agruments advanced by the
Washington government is still under
consideration by the allied govern
ments and will receive reply m due
course.
The two principal cases referred to
in the present memorandum are those
of the MaeNiff Horticultural compan
of New York and the Standard Fnder-
sround Cable company of Pittsburgh.
The MacXiff company complained of
the loss of perishable goods owinet to
the detention by the censor of ship-
pine- documents relating thereto.
The British government states that
as soon as the matter was brought
to its attention it arranged to have
a special mail bag for shipping pa
pers which would be censored immedi
ately so that no delay would occur..
In the case of the cable company
it is stated that "the government of
the Fnited States appeared to insin
uate" that the delav in the mail of the
ram'e company was directly connected
with the fact "that a British competi
tor hod obtained a contract for which
that company had been eonteincr. '
"His Majesty's government." the
note continues, "is astonished that
such insinuation should be made, es
pecially as the comnlaint from the ca
ble con-many appears not to have been
adeouatelv examined.''
The memorandum goes on to show
in considerable detail that tenders for
the contracts referred to must have
passed between the Fnited States and
Xorwav on a date prior to that upon
which the censorship of Scandinavian
mails began.
After detailing other cases, the note
continues:
"The specific comnlaints do not sun
port the general charsre against the
cfUcierov of the British censor
shin "His ra.1ety's government will al
wavs be readv to explain in detail the
workinsr of the censorship, as there
is nothing regarding it which thev
wish to conceal. fany complaints
when examined proved to arise from
badly directed letters, the irregular
sailing of neutral mail boats and oth
er causes entirely outside the control
of His Ma.lehty's government and are
often due to the action of enemies."
SUBMARINE MERCHANTMAN
LIES ALONGSIDE PIER
Clearance Papers Have Not Yet Been
Filed for German Boat.
Baltimore, July 23. The only thing
that can be affirmed of the submarine
merchantman Deutschland tonight is
that she is alongside a pier in the
Patapsco river, where sell was berth
ed fourteen days ago when she com
pleted her voyage from Germany. It
was officially stated tonight that clear
ance papers as yet have not yet been
filed and this strengthened the belief
that negotiations for insuring a con
signment of gold alone are responsi
ble for delay in the submersible's de
parture. In this connection it was reported
today from what is considered a
trustworthy source that gold in small
sacks was carried aboard the vessel
last Thursday by stevedores. It was
recalled that extra precautions in
guarding the submarine were taken
that day. Newspaper men were for
bidden to climb a pile driver from
which thej- had been making observa
tions. It was on Thursday, too, that
It was reported in New York that
marine underwriters had been asked
rates on a $4,f'00.000 consignment of
gold to be despatched on the Deutsch
land. MAIL SEIZURES MADE
BY GREAT BRITAIN
Memorandum to be Sent to Secretary
Polk Today.
Washington, July 23. Great Iliit
ain's memorandum, regarding mail
seizures was received at the fit--te de
partment today and will bo delivered
to Acting Secretary Folk tomorrow.
Officials of the department had read
it tonight but it was understood to
deal only with specific complaints,
avoiding discussion of the principles
t:t issue between the two governments.
It has been indicated that nothing
short of a readjustment of the cen
sorship of neutral mails on the prin
ciples for whieS th"a United States has
contended would be accepted as sat
isfaction". The note, about 1400 words lone,
was transmitted by Ambassador Page
at London and has been submitted to
Paris for approval of the French gov
ernment. NATIONALISTS OPPOSED TO
