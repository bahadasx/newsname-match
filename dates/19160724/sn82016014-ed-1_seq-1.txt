Permit Counties to Operate
Under Federal Act.
PART OF GOVERNOR'S MESSAGE
Definite Suggestions for Con
sideration of Legislature.
Automobile Has Created a De
mand To Be Recognized.
Good roads legislation will be one of
the big questions before the state leg
islature next -winter, according to a
prediction today by Governor Capper.
It is probable that the demand for
better highways will result In the crea
tion of a state highway commission.
Kecent passage of the federal aid law
will mean a change in the Kansas
statutes to permit counties of this state
to participate under the act and will
result in a new road building cam
paign. Kansas highway boosters are now
working on tentative drafts of a dozen
new bills which will be presented to
the state law makers in January. It is
probable that the action of highway
associations will result in a demand
for a complete revision of existing
road laws and a number of vital
amendments to the pre.sent Hodges
road law. Governor Capper will him
self urge drastic road legislation.
While he has made no statement re
garding his plans, it i regarded as
certain that his next message to the
legislature will offer a number of defi
nite suggestions for state legislation.
"Highway legislation will be one of
the most vital questions before the
state legislature next winter," pre
dicted Governor Capper. "The de
mand for better highways is not con
fined to any county or community.
The automobile has created a demand
that must be recognized and a num
ber of laws that met conditions a few
years ago, must now be amended or
entirely rewritten. .
Dcniumt for a Commission.
"I believe the legislature will face
the question of a state highway-corn-,
mission. There is a strong demand
" for this Commission. Whether, though,1
the legislature will create a salaried
commission or make present state of
ficials ex-officio members with the
state highway engineer the chief ad
viser, is a matter for the legislators to
determine. There is argument both
for the salaried and the non-salaried
commission."
Governor Capper anticipates a num
ber of amendments to the Hodges road
lav. These amendments will be made
tc meet conditions which have aiisen
since Kansas purchased more than
100.000 automobiles.
"One important matter which must
receive leeifiative attention Is a statu
tory provision permitting Kansas
counties to participate under the fed
eral appropriation for road building,"
mi id the governor. "Kansas counties
may secure federal aid in road build
ing through their own motion, backed
by a slight change in the present state
laws. It will not be necessary to se
cure an amendment to the state con
stitution for counties of this state to
receive federal aid. An ai-iendment
ly Senator Curtis provides relief
hrough a slight amendment to the
tate law."
As soon as funeral provisions of the
new federal aid law are explained to
Kansas county commissioners, it is
probable that extensive road building
campaigns will be launched. It will
not be possible to start the work this
year. Th counties must await an act
of the legislature and not until next
spring can Kansas counties begin p?r
nanent road building with fedeial aid.
31 DEATHS TODAY
'ew York Epidemic Shows In
crease Again.
Gain of Seven Over Report of
Previous Day.
New York, July 24. Another gain
in the number of fatalities and de
crease in the number of new cases was
reported by the health department to
day when the epirtt mic of infantile
paralysis entered its fifth week. Dur
ing the twenty-four hours ending at 10
a. m. today there were 31 deaths and
89 new cases reported in the greater
city, as against 23 deaths and 115 new
cases during the corresponding period
yesterday.
CROWN PRINCE
CRITICISED FOR
RECKLESS DARE
Amsterdam. July 24. The German
:rown prince made his debut last week
as a military flier, according to word
reaching here from Berlin. For fif
teen minutes the heir to the German
throne risked his life in a German
aeroplane over the French lines sur
rounding Verdun.
While admiring this fresh proof of
the crown prince's courage, consider
' able adverse comment was heard in
Berlin, the Germans holding that as
heir to the emperor, the prince should
not needlessly risk , his life in such
dangerous exhibitions of courage. It
was pointed out that before the war
the kaiser had always prohibited his
luest son from assuming such risks.
Advance Along 30-Mile Front
Riara to Kull.
FLOWER OF GERMANY'S ARMY
Russia Exnltant Over Reported
Decisive Victory.
Capture 2,700 More Men in
Jablonitza Fass Battle.
London, July 24. The Germans
have been driven back twelves miles
at one point on the Riga front, ac
cording to a Reuter's dispatch from
Petrograd. Progress of the Russians
is claimed on a front running from
the Gulf of Riga to Kull, a distance of
more than thirty miles, the greatest
advance being made along the coast
i line.
The dispatch says fighting went on
I without pause for four days prior to
j Sunday. It is now halted as the Rus
i sians require time to consolidate the
j ground they have gained and the
Germans are waiting for reinforce
ments being brought from other sec
tors of the eastern front.
Batter Through German Lines.
Petrograd, July 24. Russian armies
have blasted and battered their way
through the German line below Riga
and have shattered temporarily the
Austrian resistance to further Russian
advance toward northeastern Galicia
and Hungary.
Violent German counter-attacks
northeast of Kovel have been repulsed.
Today a violent artillery duel was in
progress between the forces of Gen
erals Kuropatkin and Von Hindenburg
along the northeasternmost point of
the battle front. So far the censors
have veiled the exact details of Gen
eral Kuropatkin's recent coup, but
the fact that the czar's troops have
been able successfully to pierce Vou
Hindenburg's line considered the
strongest to which the Russians are
opposed was hailed here as one of
the striking achievements of the war.
Push on Across Lipa and Styr.
Further details today served to ac
centuate the extent of the victories of
General Sakharoff along the rivers
Lipa and Styr. Apparently his forces
have almost endrcld th Tanrnnin
commandsof Generals Boehm-Ermolli
ana Botnmer, forcing their retirement.
Russian troops now dominate both
banks of the Lipa from the Styr to
near Mirkow and in some parts of the
line have thrust forward eight or ten
miles beyond the river. Brody is
menaced with an enveloping move
ment. Southward, Russian forces control
many of the approaches to Jablonitza
Pass and have forced retirement of
the Austrians to crests of the hills be
yond Probably the conflict today is
in the pass itself.
Considerable booty has fallen into
the Russians' hands and in two days
27,000 men have been caDtured. To
emphasize Russian successes came full
report today of more advances of the
Grand Duke Nicholas's army m Cau
casus. The Turks are in full retreat
along the full line toward Erzingan.

59,000,000 pounr's.
BY SKIN OF HIS TEETH
Villa Narrowly Escaped Get His
Hussy, Nurse and Cratches.
El Paso, July 24. Only by the
merest chance did Francisco Villa es
cape capture when his column was
repulsed by de facto troops in its at
tack upon Parral two weeks ago, ac
cording to a private letter received
here today from an American in the
town.
"Villa personally directed the band
that attacked the city," the letter said.
"He directed the operations from a
carriage about a mile behind the
lines In this carriage were two wo
men and a man. When the bandits
were pushed back by the government
troops they fled past the carriage.
J stopping only to provide their chief-
i.-ijn witn a norse on which he made
his escape.
"The women fled into the brush and
also escaped. A moment or so later
the carriage was seized by Carran
zista soldiers and the man. who i. roved
j to be a Swiss nurse, was captured.
"In the carriage were Villa's
( crutches and several rolls of bandages,
j The nurse said that Villa's wounds ne
. cessitated an immediate operation and
J complete rest for some weeks."
Entire City Hunts Man Who
Threw Suitcase In Parade.
CITY COMBED FOR SUSPECTS
Mass Meeting "To Express
Opinion Against Outrage."
Bomb Contained Xitro-Toluol,
Tremendous Explosive.
San Francisco, July 24. Under the
pressure of a public sentiment aroused
over a terrific bomb explosion which
occurred during Saturday's prepared
ness parade here, the authorities were
working with the determination to
run the perpetrator to earth. To the
death list of six it was expected that
two and probably more of the forty
four injured would be added five vic
tims being reported in a critical con
dition. Led by Mayor Rolph, who has Of
fered a reward of $5,000 for the ar
rest of the culprit, scores of citizens
have volunteered their service for
special aid, and the entire city seems
eager to lend all possible assistance.
A mass meeting "to express an
opinion on the bomb outrage" was
called today for next Wednesday by
Frederick J. Koster, president of the
chamber of commerce.
Several definite clews were being
followed with great activity.
Two men who claimed to have seen
the man with the suit case believed to
have contained the infernal machine,
described him as about 35 years old,
tall and shabbily dressed. The city
was being combed today for a man of
that description with a zeal that prom
ised results.
Tremendous Explosive.
Experts retained by the police have
arrived at the conclusion, it was said,
that the bomb had as its principal
ingredient nitro-toluol, an explosive
of tremendous power. This substance,
they say, was compressed into a
length of cast steel pipe which judg
ing from the fragments picked up in
the area of destruction, must have
been from a foot to fifteen- inches and
from hi to otght- inches tn diameter
The great quantities of bullets, slivers
of iron and other metal with which
the pipe was loaded made it a verita
ble shrapnel shell.
Nitro-toluol is one of the most
modern of the high explosives and it
has such terrific force in compact
form that it is used extensively in
quarries and mines, is easily obtained
there because of its commercial em
ployment. -
In Preparedness Parade.
Six persons were killed and forty se
verely injured Saturday afternoon
when an infernal machine was ex
ploded in the crowd viewing the great
preparedness parade in which more
than 25,000 residents of San Francisco
and the bay cities marched.
The thousands of spectators nnd
marchers in the vicinity of Steuart and
Market streets, where the exnlosion
occurred, were thrown into a wild
panic.
A suitcase in which the bomb had
been "planted" was placed or thrown
upon the sidewalk by the dynamiter.
The police arrested Frank Joseph
son, a lodger in a sailors' boarding
house, who cried "I didn't do it, I
didn't do it," and trembled violently
when he was being searched Jit the
station house. The police said he had
rot been accused of anything.
Making Anarchist Speech.
Josephson. the suspected, was ar
rested while making a speech after
the explosion in which he is said to
have lauded anarchy, and declared:
"This is nothing."
After his arrest, however, he said
that he was not an anarchist and de
nied having any knowledge of the ex
plosion. List of Dead and Injured.

44 CENTS OF EVERY $1 IN WAGE
How Employes Share in 3 Mil
lions for Transportation.
Shall a Probe by Government
Determine This Issue I"
New Tork, July 24. What is prob
ably the most elaborate study of
wages ever made in any Industry has
just been completed by the national
conference committee of the railways.
For six months railway accountants
throughout the country have been en
gaged in collecting the payroll records
to show the actual wage payments to
every individual employe among the
300,000 engineers, conductors, firemen
and brakemen now voting on a na
tional strike for a new wage scale.
That these employes are one cf the
highest paid groups of workers in any
industry is disclosed by the summary
made public today by the railroad
managers.
Average Yearly Wage.
The average yearly wage payments
to all western train employes (includ
ing those who worked only part of the
year), as shown by the 1916 payrolls,
were:
Passenger Freight Yard
Engineers $2,038 $1,737 $1,218
Conductors 1,772 1,624 1,292
Firemen 1,218 73 832
Brakemen U21 1.U0U 1,U2U
On all the western railroads In 1915,
75 per cent of the train employes
earned these wages (lowest, highest
and average of all) as shown by the
pay rolls:
Engineers Passenger, $1,747 to
$3,094. average. $2,196; freight, $1,537

GIRL WITH A DOLL
Mne-Year-Old Girl Tells of At
tempted Assault.
Robert Graham, Age 52, Arrest
ed on Serious Charge.
Robert Graham, age 52, father of
several grown children, was arrested
today on a' state warrant charging him
with a statutory offense against Al
berta Powers, a 13 year old girl.
Graham was arrested Sunday by the
police but was turned over to the
county today following the filing of
the complaint and the issuance of the
warrant.
The story told to the county attor
ney by relatives of the girl was
one of the most revolting related in
that office in years. A little girl 8 or
9 years of age, with a big doll in her
arms, said Graham had attempted to
commit a crime against her, and failed
through no fault of his own.
HOT DAYS; COOL NIGHTS
Little Clinncc for Any Early Change
In the Weather.
Hot days alternating with compara
tively cool nights has been the pro
gram in all parts of Kansas during the
last three days. The corn crop over
the state is suffering greatly for want
of rain and the wind of the last few
days is drying out the ground at a
rapid rate. The high temperature
mark here Sunday was 97 degrees but
the breeze made the heat bearable.
Sunday's high reading was within 2
degrees of the high mark for this year.
Last night was fairly comfortable with
the temperature 1 degree below nor
mal. After blowing for more than a week
from the north and northeast, the
wind has shifted and t; is morning
was in the south. The lowest temper
ature this morning waj 67 degrees.
The mercury today did not climb quite
so rapidly as on Sunday and it was not
expected to go so high. The Kaw
river is falling again after a rise of
rearly a foot. The stage today was
5.9 feet.
The forecast calls for generally fair
and continued warm weather tonight
and Tuesday! "Generally" fair leaves
an opening for a few light scattered
showers in some parts of the state,
but no relief is in sight for the state
as a whole.
. Today's temperatures on page 8.
The highest-item perature cn record
for this date is 106 degrees, estab
lished in 1901. This is within 1 de

PAY $2,500 IN SIXTY DAYS
Wife Young and Pretty-
Given Jackson St. Property.
That Isn't All She Receive!
Fifteen Dollars Monthly.
John G. Cooper, whose matrimonial
and financial difficulties date back
several years, to a time when he con.
eluded he had too much money to
trurn tti prnnnini1 nf Yim lift nlntlA-
can now write another chapter to tha
book of his life. As a matter of fact
he doesn't have to write it. Judge A.
W. Dana of the first division of the
district court, attended to that little .
detail for him.
, Within sixty days Cooper must pay
to Cora T. Cooper, his wife, $2,600.
That's the court's order. And the or
der is made in such manner that if
Cooper fails to pay It becomes a lien
upon property owned by Cooper on
Qulncy street. The property may then
be sold to pay the $2,500.
Besides that. Cooper is ordered to
pay jura, uooper 915 a month, begin
ning August 1, and continuing until
further orders from the court. i
Reading on down through the pe
tition Cooper found further cause for
remorse. The court orders that Mr.
Cooper shall remain in possession of
the Cooper property on Jackson street
between Eighth avenue and Ninth
street as long as the marriage rela
tion continues.
That last provision might hold out
hope to the aged Cooper, but it
doesn't. In the next breath the court
denies his application for a divorce,
filed as a cross petition when his wife
asked for separate maintenance. Mrs.
Cooper doesn't want a divorce not
under the provisions of the court or-
By remaining the wife of John Q.
Cooper although she doesn't have to
live with htm she gets $2,600 in cash
within sixty days, $15 a month there
after and a good home within a block
of Kansas avenue, fronting en . the
state house grounds. , .
- Must Pay All Costs.
After handing all that to the ven
erable defendant the court appends a
paragraph to the effect that Cooper
shall pay all the costs of the litigation
to date, and a blank is left for tiie in
sertion of the total amount when it
has been figured up. '
John G. Cooper is an old man con
siderably past 70. Mrs. Cooper is a
young woman. They were meiried
several years ago after Mr. Cooper
had been disentangled by the courts
from another expensive matrimonial
alliance. . , .
There is a little child involved in
the latest case, a child of Mr. and Mr.
Cooper, and it is because of the rhlld
that Cooper has been a consistent loser
in the legal battle. ..
Fifteen years ago Cooper ' owned
farm lands here and there and half
a dozen valuable pieces of preperty in
Topeka. No recent list of his remain

one of his attorneys recently pleaded

a judgment against him.
MUST SETTLE IT
Believes .England mil nun-
draw Blacklist of Merchants.
Too Foolish To Be Tenable,
Says Hoke Smith.
Washington, July 24. "The black
list difficulty will be adjusted," Sen
ator Hoke Smith of Georgia declared
today after a talk with the president.
"I believe Great Britain will with
draw either the whole or the major
part of this blacklist ordered," he
said.
Smith has been a leader or me op
position in this country to England's
blockade policies, most of which oppo
sition has been unsuccessful. The fact
that he sees defeat for the present
British plan was regarded as signifi
cant.
"That policy is so foolirh that I
think even Great Britain will appre
ciate it." said the senator.
To other callers today tha president
admitted the blacklist difficulty "got
on his nerves." He admitted, how
ever, that the method of handling it
had not been determined. In British
circles today it was declared the direct
loss in trade by United States firms
v.ill be infir.itesmal, and that the indi
rect gain, particularly in South Amer
ico, should be great.
Boom for Some Firms.
It was pointed out that only those
firms having direct dealings with the
central powers have been blacklisted
and that this policy should remo the
fear that there may be widespread
ramifications of the boycott of firms
with only domestic relations as the
bovcotted continues.
Since the war first began, tlie
British officials here said today's a
number of these blacklisted firms have
been maintaining Germany's trade re
lations with (South America. Now."
however, since that will be stopped,
straight out American houses will be
able to enter the South American trade
field almost without competition.
It is understood that insofar as the
South American issue is concerned no
opposition to the blacklist is being
met with from several large and pow
erful banking houses of New York
which have recently gone in for boutb
American trade.
