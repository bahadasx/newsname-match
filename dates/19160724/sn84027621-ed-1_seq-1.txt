Some of the citizens of Ocala who
go down town half a dozen times a

CHRISTMAS EVE"
Beauty Spot,at Silver Springs Has
Been Discovered and Christened
with Appropriate Name
There seems no end to the attrac
tions of Silver Springs and the run.
Mr. T. T. Madden, guide and pilot of
the glass bottomed boat,' has found
another bunch of beauties under the
ever rippling water. As all regular
visitors to the springs are aware,
there is a little cove on the north side
of the run half a mile down from the
springs. It has been a good fishing
place, and some times boats tie up in
it, but nobody looked for beauties on
the bottom till Mr. Madden steered
the glass-bottomed boat into it a few
months ago. He found it had curios
ities almost equal to those of the
other springs, for it is a spring itself,
water bubbling upin great quantities
thru the rock. Mr. Madden has called
it "Christmas Eve," for the following
reasons. Several bunches of the most
delicate moss have roots right by
some of the springs, and the force of
the water coming up keepthem erect
and waving just like little green trees
in the wind. They look like miniature
Christmas trees, and their appearance
caused Mr. Madden to gTve the cove
its appropriate as well as ' pretty
name. Mr. Madden makes an excel
lent captain for the glass-bottomefl
boat. He is enthusiastic about the
springs, and has a gift of calling at
tention to their beauties that causes
all who voyage with him to see many
interesting things that they might
otherwise overlook.

FRANK'S BIG CLEAN UP
V SALE IS A WINNER
a pin
1
The big sale inaugurated at Frank's
opened Saturday with a most satis
factory day's business. Mr. Frank
says that there was no great rush but
a steady business all day and late into
the evening Saturday and a continu
ance along the same line during the
forenoon of today.
Mr. Frank, as manager of the old
Boston Store, inaugurated in Ocala
the custom of putting on at intervals
during- the year big stock reduction
sales under various titles. He says,
tho, that whatever the title of the sale,
the aim was always the same, viz: to
reduce the stock at the tag end of the
season so as not . to carry over any-
thing into the next season. He says
that he has found this the most satis
factory, not only to himself, but also
tohis thousands of patrons, as the
latter are always sure of obtaining
new goods when he season opens, in
stead of possibly left overs of the last '
year.
The "hour sales" Saturday were
signal for' a rush to the certain de
partments in which extra specials
were offered.
Some of the Frank sales are devot
ed only to special departments, but
the present clean-up proposition takes
in the whole establishment and this
puts Mr. Frank in position to serve
the whole family with dry good 3 and
clothing necessities.
The prices named in the thousands
of circulars distributed and also in
the Frank ads. are sufficient evidence
that the affair is a genuine clear-up
sale, and anyone in need of dry goods
should avail themselves of the oppor
tunity offered there.
