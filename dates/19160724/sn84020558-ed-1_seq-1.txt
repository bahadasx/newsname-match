LONDON, July :
23. The fourth week
of the Somme battle begins well for the
entente allies ami is expected to be
fruitful of important developments.
Before Saturday midnight the British
he-gun a new attack on the whole line
from Pozieres to Guillemont, and the
fact that Cieneral Haig has been able
to resume the offensive so soon after
the unsuccessful German counter at
tacks of last week, in which very strong
German forces were brought forward,
is regarded as good augury.
The fighting has been of the fiercest
character, the Germans working with
their utmost strength to prevent the
British from advancing to their third
lino positions. But when the last re
ports left headquarters in France, the
Australians had firmly established
themselves in Pozieres and are reported
to have placed themselves astride the
road in the direction or Bapaume. while
at Guillemont and Longueval fortunes
fluctuated, both places changing hands
several times. Late tonight fighting
was proceeding with the utmost vio
lence. The German counter attacks recently
delivered against the French front have
proved equally unsuccessful and the
entente allies are now fighting slowly
in the direction of Comhles, which is
only two miles distant from Guillemont.
According to a reliable estimate the

stage of intense violence.
"In the neighborhood of Pozieres,
territorial and Australian troops, at
tacking from the southwest and south
east respectively, carried the German
outer works by assault shortly after
midnight. Violent fighting now is
taking place in the village where the
Germans are offering a desperate resis
tance with large numbers of machine
guns.
"On other parts of the battle front
the fighting is equally Intense and
here no definite progress is yet re

had recaptured the vhole of Lonirue

From the eastern frontier come fur

Field Marshal von Hindenburg's line
at several points, and, according to an
unofficial report, has penetrated a dis

At the other extremity of the long

Kxcept in the Dniester region, heavy

Washington, July 23. General Jacinto Trevino. commander of the Car
ranza forces in northeastern Mexico, has been ordered to Mexico City and
will be succeeded, at least temporarily, by General Luis Herrera, comman
der of the Chihuahua City garrison. Dispatches to the war department to
day frcm General Bell, reporting the transfer, contained no explanation
as to the cause.
General Trevino has personally directed the campaign against bandits in
Chihuahua, anH it is said to e largely Because of his efforts that the Car
ranza soldiers have continued their operations sqainst Villa and other out
law leaders on such a broad scale. For that reason some regret over the
transfer was expressed here, though officials said they were confident that
General Herrera would use every res

handed to the American ambassador
lying to certain American com
plaints against the British censorship

few specific allegations made in the
recent American note. It is stated that
the formal answer to the general argu
ments advanced by the Washington
government is still under consideration
by the entente allied governments and
will receive reply in due course.
The two principal cases referred to
in the present memorandum are those
of the MacNiff Horticultural company
of New York and the Standard Under
ground Cable company of Pittsburg.
The MacNiff company complained of
the loss of perishable goods owing to
the detention by the censorship of
mailing documents relating thereto.

so soon as the matter was brought to
its attention it arranged to have a
special mail bag for shipping papers
which would he immediately censored,
also that no delay would occur Tn
the case of the cable company, it is
stated that "the government of the
1'nited states appeared to insinuate"
that the delay in the mail of the cable

the fact that "a British competitor had

PARIS, July 23. The destruction of
a German fortified work on the Somme
front was marked by a tragic episode,
says La Liberte. The order was given
to destroy the fort at whatever cost.
In less than six hours more than 2,500
great shells were fired at it and the
defenses gave way one bv one in a
cloud of dust and smoke. The infantry
then went forward ancf the German po
sitions were conquered.
French artillery officers, examinina
the ruins, discovered among a mass of
debris a Bavarian officer with his chest
crushed and at the point of death. At
sight of the French officers the Ba
varian seemed to collect himself, then
began to speak softly, the Frenchmen
kneeling about him,
The story told by the Bavarian and
later recounted by an artillery officer
was that thirty-two men had occupied
the work. After the bombardment had
continued for a time, half of the men
were victims of an awful death. Two
were decapitated and of three others,
near whom a shell exploded, not a ves
tige remained. The survivors crouched
at the bottom of the subterranean shel
ter and awaited their fate.
Another terrific explosion occurred,
the men being thrown together in a
confused heap. Almost immediately
flames shot up from the underground
cavern. There was a moment of in
describable terror, for now fire was
ravaging the work. The lieutenant in

However, a sharp denial was givei
