League Leaders Lose Third
Straight Contest of Sea
son to Columbia.
RUTLEDGE IS A STAR
Red Sox Knock Caldwell Out
of Box Taylor Checks
the Hitting.
The Mobcrly Red Sox. the leaders
in the Central Missouri league, were
piesented with their third successive
defeat at the hands of the Columbia
Browns at Mobcrly yesterday after
noon. The panic ended 7 to '4, with
the Urowns supporting the big num
eral. The Urowns got the lead in the
f cond with one run. but Mobcrly tied
tl:-- score the next inning. After that
.Mobcrly did not have a look-in until
tbr seventh, when Caldwell went aero
planiug and Mobcrly scored three
runs. Taylor was playing ccnterfield.
and he exchanged positions with Cald
well. Mobcrly swung helplessly the
rest of the game, getting but two hits
and not a single run.
Hut the game was put in the re
frigerator in the fourth inning, when
with two out and Dippold paying a
visit to first base. Mason got a hit
and a Red Sox let Caldwell get to
first on an error. When Davis stopped
at second base Mason, Dippold and
Caldwell were panting on the bench.
Hut when it rains, it rains hard. So
l.igon swatted a swift one, and Davis
was chalked up for the fifth run of
tin- Urowns. Winegar struck out.
The Urowns scored two more runs
in the sixth.
Jiutiedge scared the crowd in the
'ourth inning. The first man up wal
loped the ball out near left field, right
between Rutledgc and the sun. Rnt
lodgc saw the ball leave the bat and
then disappear, but he kept on run
ning and threw up his gloved hand in
t'espair. The ball stuck. Xow Rut-l'-dge
modestly wonders how the ball
happened to pick out his glove for a
landing place.
Xeff, the brand-new pitcher of the
.Mobcrly Red Sox, was escorted away
from danger in the sixth inning, and
IHivenick tried to hold down the
Urowns and he did.
Hobbio Hogg did not play. He did I
not show up in time for the game.
The Urowns will play Mexico here
next Sunday and probably an exhi
hi'km game during the week.

The rose's scent remains e'en though the rose
That gladdened many a simph lane of life
Succumbs to time and passes from the strife
To blossom in a realm where beauty blows
Unmarred by withering age. Th? summer wind
Runs softest fingers through green bushes still
To kiss its child, and wcakenel of its thrill
Goes sad away the rose it cannot find.
Yet on each winging breeze flies pjrfumc rare.
The rose's heart will not depart from men.
Still will they fold youth's fields all golden when
They feel the ripple or the singin; air.
He had a way of singing like fie mirth
Of first love that brings fairies t the earth.

PARIS, July 24. Extraordinary

this evening.
On the banks of the Meuse, in the

LONDON. July 24. Amid a blast of
artillery fire hurled from big guns,
British forces have advanced steadily
forward in the direction of Pozieres,
General Haig reported this afternoon.
Fighting is continuing with the ad
vantage to the Britons.
The British commander reported
that ground had been gained near
the historic wood of Pozieres.
General Haig said the German at
tacks between Highwood and Suillc
mont had been without success and
that British artillery and machine
guns have inflicted heavy casualties.
Last night was one of comparative
calm, he continued.
Despite General Haig's statement
that the night was "comparatively
calm," special dispatches from Paris
today declared that the battle along
the Pozieres line was continuing.
Successful resumption of Haig's
massed infantry pushed within the
short space of three days after the
initial effort has advanced the British
lines to within striking distance of the
third-line trenches.
Special dispatches emphasize terrific
hand-to-hand fighting raging around
Guillemont. Half of the village is In
British hands but in the other half
the Germans are strongly entrenched
and fighting desperately to hold the
ground.

BALTIMORE, July 24. Men con

of the Bremen, sister ship of the
sub-sea freighter Deutschland.
But in the same breath they declar
ed that they have no reason to be

and they explained that while she Is
en route they would have no means
of tracing her.
It was recalled that Captain Kocnig
announced the Bremen was due here
shortly." Officials, however, refused
to reveal anything as to the schedule
time for sailing of the Deutschland for
Germany or the arrival of the Bremen
here.
The Bremen is furnished with suf
ficient oil for a month or more of
speedy traveling, and perhaps, It was
said, she might have found It expedi
ent to lie submerged for longer pe
riods than the Deutschland.
It was entirely apparent that the
local officers knew the vessel left

information about her.
