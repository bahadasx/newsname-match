crown prince made his debut last week

Emperor. Prince Frederick Wllhelm
should not needlessly risk his lire In
such dangerous exhibitions of courage.
It was pointed out that before the war
the Kaiser always had prohibited his
eldest son from assuming such risks.

J. H. (CYCLONE) DAVIS,
Congressman-at-large from Texas.
"Cyclone"
Helped to
Defeat,
"Boose, boodle, and big business i
brought about my defeat In Texas. In
addition, they refused to carry my name
as 'Cyclone' on the ballot. Everybody
knows 'Cyclone' Davis; a lot of voters
never heard of J. H. Davis."
J. H. Davis, known since 1692, when he
was a armera' Alliance orator, as "Cy
clone" Davis, thus explained today nis
defeat as a candidate for Congressman-at-large
from the State of Texas In the
primaries held there on Saturday.
Mr. Davis, sltUng In his office at the
Capitol, said he guessed he was through
with politics. He held In his hand a
telegram from Texas saying that he
was trailing about 10,000 votes behind In
the free-for-all race.
There were thirteen candidates for
Congressman-at-large, and Congressman
Jeff McLemore and former Congressman
Daniel E. Garrett now appear to bp
the winners.
Liquor Interests Chief Foe.
"The liquor Interests fought me hard,"
explained Congressman Davis, as he
stroked his flowing whiskers and pushed
a broad-brimmed black hat off a pers
piring forehead.
"I have fought them for twenty-five
years, and assisted In running liquor out
of county after county In Texas. Big
business combined with the liquor In
terests. "Outside of that, however, I lost thou
sands of votes because the State chair
man wouldn't carry me on the ballot as
'Cyclone' Davis. I have a letter hero
from a friend saying he didn't know my
initials were J. H.
"There were three Davises on the
ticket one running for Congress, one
for the Senate, and one for commis
sioner of agriculture.
"Everybody knows me ss Cyclone
Davis. I never use the Initials J. II.

letter heart that way, and my commis
sion two years ago carried the name
"I have sued the State chairman for
150,000 damages. I also tried to man
damus him to force the printing of 'Cy
clone' on the ballots, but It was too
late. Some of my friends got 'Cyclone'
on the ballot In a few counties.

Some months ago Johnson turned up
In Spain With his wire, an English box

took a suite of rooms at a palatial

was not permitted to leave Spain with
out a passport. The American embassy
refused to Issue him a passport under
Instructions from Washington because
ho fled from Chicago during his prose
cution for white slavery.
Making the best of his plight, John
son went to Barcelona and staged a
prlzo fight betweon himself and another
negro. But Spaniards are so used to
seeing blood spilled at bull fights that
tho bout was not a success, though
Johnson beat his opponent to a pulp in
an effort to satisfy the spectators' love
for gore. The $1,000 Johnson earned at
that fight soon ran out, and he Is

U-BOAT IN PORT
British Submarines Reported to
Be on Way Here to Intercept
the Deutschland.
K0ENIGAND MEN FEEL STRAIN
Restless Patrol of Atlantio
Coast by French and English
Ships of War Continues.
LONDON, July 24. Denial
that British war vessels have
captured the German submarine
freighter Bremen, sister ahip to
the Deutschland, waa fives to
day by official authority to tha
United Press.
BALTIMORE, July 24. Failure
of the cargo U-boat Bremen to ar
rive as scheduled is the real rea
son for'holding the Deutschland
in port here.
This is the explanation for Cap
tain Koenig's failure to slip out to
sea in a daring dash and attempt
to slipv by the cordon of allied
warships off shore in the Atlantic.
Grave fears that the sister ship
of the undersea marvel here has
met with disaster is felt by the
crew of the Deutschland and by
the agents. Due a week ago and
no news having arrived, the strain
is beginning to tell on the men
who are waiting, nerves on edge,
to face a myriad of unknown per
ils in their attempt to win -their
way back home.
DELAY ADDS TO PERIL.
Today come well authenticated re
ports that In addition to the line of
French and British warships cruising
up and down the coast two powerful
seagoing English submarines are
speeding In to join them. Every hour
of delay Is believed to add to the
danger Captain Koenlg will havs to
face.
A hundred reasons have been ad
vanced In explanation o fthe delayed
departure of the commercial sub
marine. Shipping men. officials, news
paper correspondents, and alleged
''spies" of the allies have waited for
davs for the dash to sea. Now comes
ne report rrom uerman sources that
he Deutschland awaits tha Bremen.
and will remain In Baltimore harbor
until the fats of her sister ship Is
known.
May Mean Failure.
It Is hinted that If the Bremen does
not slip Into some American harbor,
rivaling the feat of the Deutschland,
her failure will end the German-American
undersea traffic
The destruction of the Bremen will so
discourage -the promoters of the daring
commercial submarine line that the risks
to be run and the expense of the traffic
will moke It unattractive. The experi
ment, it is believed, is too costly to be
repeated that is, If the allies' vessels
destroy the Bremen.
Captain Koenlg is understood to nave
told German friends here that the
Deutschland will not sail until the Bre
men arrives. The Bremen was expected
a week ago. Where she Is nobody
knows but the strain Is beginning to
tell.
Restless Patrol On.
The restless patrol of the coast by
the war vessels of the allied countries
continues. For more than a week now
theso vessels have been In wait like
men who do the death watch on some
fellow who has been condemned to ex
ecution. Probably the Deutschland will escape
the watchers: perhaps tho Bremen will
slip In past them at Baltimore or some
other port but the worry has begun
to tell on the Intrepid Koenlg and those
who have staked all on a sporting
chance.
Anxiety Is betrayed In tho movements
of Captain Koenlg. Paul Hilken, of
the Schumacher Company, nnd Captain
Hlnsch, of the Interned German liner
Neckar. It la apparent they aro wor
ried over tho non-arrival of the Bremen,
which, according to Germans clnso. to
the source of Information, should have
arrived at somo American port about
a week ago.
Wdiild Be Disconcerting.
It was the original plan that the Bre
men would dash Into thn New York,
Boston or Philadelphia harbor. Germans
believed that It would be especially
disconcerting were the Bromon to bob
up amid n group of French and Flng
llsh steamships.
The promoters of the venture, how
ever, planned that It the cordon of al
lied warships off New York became too
tight an attempt would bo made to
Drlng the Bremen to Baltimore, al
though It Is not Intended that this port
shall get "all of the glory" ot the un
precedented traffic under tho sea.
One of the many reports advanced tn
connection with the delayed departuro
of the Deutschland Is that $1,000,000 in
gold Is aboard and that Insurance there
for has not been negotiated.
This report, like many others, has not
been confirmed, and tho growing opinion
here Is that the Deutschland awaits tno
arrival of tho Bremen.
If. tho latter submarine slips througn
the allied guard, tho ottlcers and men
of the Deutschland will start towarn
their native land with enlightened hearts
and a confidence of success.
The Deutschland has been barricaded
In her dock and It Is learned today
that this Is through a fear that some
