Bay Islands Are
Dreamy, But Not
the Bay Islanders
BY MABEL ABBOTT
Berries, apples, poultry and eggs, dairy products and summer
boarder* seem, on a cursory survey, to be the principal crops of the
Bay Island region.
The crop of summer boarders and campers almost failed this
year, owing to t lie late season. Only within a week or two have
the wharves at Delano Dead). Sylvan iind other summer resorts
bloomed with striped skirts and reckless sweaters: and the little
steamers which ply the devious waterways among the islands ure not
carrying anything like their usual summer crowds.
llu "siiinnici people," however, arc 11 miuill part of tin*
population. On the little Iki-ium thai lie in squares ..I li^lit
mill (lark nrrcii ull along 'In- passages, hays .ml inlets and
111 lonely inland ■ Iraiinv., the real husine-ss of the district
KOTO on tlie year round —the business of | i<Minting a city's
foo«l.
Tacoma is the geographically logical market of the Bay Island
district: but buyers come from much farther than 'I'acoina.
Within the last three months milk testing stations have been
established at Rosedale, Wauna, Picnic Point, (!ig Harbor and Hur
ley, by the Mutual creamery, a concern with branches in Seattle,
Portland and other cities.
The Rosedale station Is managed by W. K. White: the one at
Wanna by* Gladstone Murray: the one at Picnic oPint by 11, J. Mon
roe; the one at Qlg Harbor by 11. Henspn, and the one at Hurley by
Mr. McClintock. At these stations the milli brought in by each farm
er in the neighborhood is scientifically analyzed and its cream value
determined. The creamery pays for all cream the same day it is
received, Mrs. White told me.
Agents lor a big Seattle packing house drive through the region
frequently, buying eggs and veal.
On the east side of Henderson bay, I heard reiterated statements
that berries and fruit had proved so unprofitable thai fields and or
chards are being dug up and turned into pasture for dairy herds.
YKT AT SYLVAN I WAS TOLD THAT THE BAY ISLAND DIS
TRICT IBNT Ol'T 58,000 ORATKS OF BERRIKfI THIS YKAR: AND

On the west side of the bay, more and more land is being put
into poultry ranches. Alaska is demanding eggs at this season of
•the year, and for that reason more eggs are going to Seattle than
to Tacoma at present.
The Hay Island district is as dreamily beautiful as any Italian
picture, just now. When cruising through its lovely waterways, or
riding over its hills and valleys, it looks like a stage setting for a
romantic drama.
Hut be not <l< < .-Uc.l. There is nothing dreamy about the Hay
Islanders.

The Tim en-A polio baby contest.
Jackson's studio, which for a
week has bten taking care of
babies of every size, apepar.ince
and temperament, today faced—■
and survived —the biggest .vave
yet.
So they will be ready to take
you baby's picture free tomorrow
morning, if you have been unable
to get there before.
It may be a "last minute" S,jby
that will get the $20 first ,irize.
Or the $10 or the $'> prizes.
It will take the rest of the
week to develop and print all the
pictures. Then, beginning July
30, they will be displayed in the
entrance of the A|K>llo theater
during the entire week of the run
of the great film "Where Are My
Children?"
Mothers whose babies are en
tered in the contest are given free
passes to this show. All who go
to see this remarkable film, which
deals in a serious and thoughtful
way with the question of birth
control, will be allowed to vote
on the babies.
All the babies that enter the
content and the winning babies
will be filmed in the movies ulso
at some early date.
It will be a fine looking bunch
of babies. Better have the pic
ture of yours among them.
Motliers of babies whose pic
