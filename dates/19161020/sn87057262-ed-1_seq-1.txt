GREAT OVATION
FOR PRESIDENT
Mr. Wilson's Visit to Chicago
Was an Event Which Made
Him Happy by Its
Success.
WAS THE GREATEST YET
New Nationalism is Being Brought
Out Now as One of the Big
Issues of the
Campaign.
[By Robert J. Bender. United Press
Staff Correspondent]
CANTON, Obio, Oot. 20.—With
echoes of the greatest demonstra
tions ever tendered him still ring
ing in his ears. President Wilson is
returning homo today. He himself
and all of his lieutenants are happy
as a result of the Chicago visit.
"The greatest yet," Secretary Tum
ulty said vrlth unrestrained en
thusiasm.
"An ovation from start to finish.
The women in this part of thp coun
try are thoroughly aroused to the
Issue of the campaign and they want
the president returned to office," was
the message sent out to the demo
cratic headquarters east and west.
There is no doubting now that the
president has embarked upon a de
termined effort to bring out as the
one big issue of the campaign a "new
nationalism," first forcibly set forth
in hiB Omaha address and later am
plified in his Indianapolis speeches.
Yesterday the idea stood out in a
further exposition of this theme. In
the Press club speech, he emphasized
the need of uniting the progressive
forces to accomplish 'Che purposes of
American business. In his second
address, he urged cooperation of
capital and labor to serve the end
which he said must be served by
the United States showing the world
how to place the cause of labor on
a par with thit of the employer and
the rights of humanity "above the
rights of sovereignity." Finally in
his speech at the Sto$k Yards pavil
lion last night, where he was greeted
by the greatest and most demonstra
tive throng that has heard him at
any time since the campaign opened,
the president further enlarged upon
his theme and said that men who
come to this country are expected to
"put a new afection, a new allegi
ance, above every other affectiop and
allegiance" in a "triumphant illustra
tion of the spirit of America la the
service of mankind."
In this effort to unite the people
of the country for the purpose of
accomplishing the big task which, he
says, will face America when the
war Is over, the president appears
to have thrown aside party lines in
his out and out appeal to all "for
ward looking progressives." He will
continue the same policy in speeches
delivered away from Shadow Lawn
during the balance of the campaign,
hinting only at the dangers of oust
ing a power and policy which has
guided the nation along a "certain
known course" for a power and policy
whose course if- "uncertain and un
known."
Today the president is again greet
ing Ohio and Pennsylvania crowds.
He will rearfh Shadow Lawn late to
night. Tomorrow he will celebrate
