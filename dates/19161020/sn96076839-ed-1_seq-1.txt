THAT FAKES WON'T GO.
AN UNEQUIVOCAL STATEMENT

Saloonkeeper's So Called Homo
Rule Amendment.
The following resolution was adopt
d unanimously by the Executive Com
mittee, of the Michigan State Grange
it a meeting held at Lansing, Septem
ber 6. 1916:
WHEREAS. The president of an
arganlzation favoring the adoption of
the so-called "Home Rule" amend
ment, Intended to destroy the present
bounty Local Option system by
providing a smaller unit for Its appli
cation, has advertised himself as a
'member of the State Grange" with
, :he evident intention of carrying the
Inference that he represents the sent!
lAnt of the Michigan State Grange.
,JAN WHEREAS, The State Grange
in all Its annual sessions in recent
years has by unanimous vote en

reduction of the unit to the township,
village and city,
THEREFORE RESOLVED, by the
Executive Committee of the State
Grange, acting for and with the full
authority of that body between its
annual sessions, that the action of the
said person is entirely out of harmony
with the sentiment and intent of the
State Grange and that until state-wide
prohibition f the liquor traffic be
comes an actual fact, we are un
alterably opposed to any decrease in
the unit of territory for local option
telow th? county and call upon every
member In our order and every lover
&f sobriety, good government and
clean manhood to work earnestly and
persistently from now until the polls
close on the evening of November

voter to vote "NO" on this so-called
"Home Rule" amendment, which Is
but another attempt to destroy what
we have already gained in the fight
against the saloon.

CROSSING THE BAR"
What the Drink Traffic Costs the
American Consumers.
The retail cost of alcoholic liquors
consumed by the people of the United
States during 191G has just been esti
mated by Mr. William P. F. Ferguson,
the statistican, at $2,151,201,765. Mr.
Ferguson's estimate In 1914 was 2,
136.919,537. If these figures are correst, the
drink bill was $285, 717, 772 less in
1915 than In 1914, which does not ac
cord with the theory that consumption
Is unaffected by prohibition.
Mr. Ferguson arrives at his figures
by allowing $6.25 a gallon for domestic
spirits, $8.00 for imported spirits,
(2.00 for domestic wines, $4.00 for im
ported wines, $0.64 H for domestic
beer, and $1.00 for imported beer.
The totals are $876,409,846 for
spirits, $76,776,256 for wine; and $1,
198.015,663 for beer.
The total expenditure for alcoholic
liquors for the past seven years is
estimated at $16,105,271,079. The re
ceipts from internal revenue (1909-15)
and duties (1&8-14) for the past
seven years amount to $1,642,463,428,
leaving a net fiscal loss by reason of
the Internal revenue system for seven
years of $14,462,807,651.
The straight and narrow path isn't
wide enough for some people.
The man who sits down and waits
for something to turn up will succeed
in time. His toes will turn up.
A bachelor never figures on marry
n a widow, but when a widow figures
n marrying a bachelor the wedding
bells do ring!
When a man and wife argue the man
gets a good chance to say a lot of un
printable things and the wife to turn
on the brine.
GIRL" DIES AS PREDICTED
Fortune Teller Told Pennsylvania Girl
to Avoid Trips on the
Water.
Phoenlxville, Pa. The body of Doro
thy Barr, the seventeen-year-old girl
of this place, who drowned In the
Schuylkill river, was found about one
mile from the spot where she lost her
life when her canoe upset. Lock Ten
der Hennessy, at the Pawling locks,
saw the body floating In the river and
recovered it from a boat.
The drowning of Miss Barr and the
finding of her body followed the pre
diction mnJe a week before the girl's
death by a fortune teller whom she
und a girl friend consulted In a spirit
of fun. The see then told Miss Barr
to avoid all trips or voyages upon the
water, and said she would take such
a trip and would drown. The fortune
teller also predicted that after four
days her body would be recovered.
The girl laughed at the clairvoyant,
but the prophesy was vividly recalled
to the mind of her companion when
the body was recovered.
SON COMMANDS HIS FATHER
Latter Is a Private In a Militia
; Company, and Former Is
I Lieutenant
Kansas City, Knn. The regular or
der of things Is that the son should
take orders from the father.
But In Company A, Kansas National
Guard of Kansas City, Kan., this or
der Is reversed in the case of Wil
liam Flrstenbeger, father; and Alfred
Firstenberger, son.
William Firstenberger, although
postmaster of Kansas City, Kan., and
an Important appearing person of some
250 pounds, is just a private.
Alfred Firstenberger Is Second Lieu
tenant of the company, much smaller
in size Amt possessing authority.
So when Son Firstenberger issues or
ders "Pa" Firstenberger, although he
may be a bit tired or perhaps differ
ing In opinion must obey them. In
this case the sou has to be obeyed.
RABBIT'S EYE FOR A GIRL
Surgeons Expect to Restore Sight of
I Seventeen-Year-Old Eskimo
Girl.
j Portland, Ore. New York's best
surgeons will indeavor to restore th
sight of Melba, a seventeen-year-old
Eskimo girl, who was found, deserted
In au Iglee by Dr. 11. French, United
States government physician In
Alaska.
The cornea of a rabbit will be graft
ed upon one affected eye and a cata
ract removed from the other.
In charge of Mrs. Corinne Call, a
government teacher, the child arrived
In Portland recently. Mrs. Call says
the Eskimos left Melba In the Ice hut,
hoping she would die. She has been

cornea.
DISCOVER GOLD IN THE SAND
Find In Minnesota Creek Causes Fever
to Spread to Whole Surround
ing Country.
Austin, Minn. Gold has been found
here In the sands of the Cedar river.
Samples sent to assayers recommend
ed by the treasury department at
Washington were found to run as high
in value as $1,604.80 a ton.
The appearance of the mineral,
known as float gold, In banks of the
stream has caused the fever to spread
to the surrounding country, and farm
era now are sending samples out for
authoritative Inspection.
The first find was made by Mrs.
Daisy Dalager during the excavation
for a cellar.
KING DRINKS AFTER HORSE
Interesting Anecdote Related About
Albert of Belgium by Son of
Manufacturer.
Paris. The son of a leading manu
facturer of Brussels, whose two broth
ers have been killed at the front, tells
the following anecdote, which dates
from the first summer of the war:
"It had been a hot day, and King
Albert, who had not left the trenches
for hours, was suffering from thirst,
lie asked for something to drink, but
not a soldier had anything left. Back
of the trenches a man saw a horse
drinking and went over and started to
pull the bucket away.
'Don't do that,' said the king. 'Let
the poor animal drink; perhaps It
needs it more than I do.'
"It was not until the horse had fin
ished drinking that the king 'took up
the bucket and drank the few drops
that remained.
The sweetness of some women re
minds us of sugar-coated bitter pills.
Prohibition Revolution
By II. L ALBEE, Mayor of Portland
Portland under Prohibition has undergone a great revolution.
January, 1916, shows arrests of 91 drunks and 210 vagrants as
against 526 drunks and 355 vagrants in January, 1915.
Mercantile business has improved over previous conditions, the
financial situation of the country considered.
The moral improvement is wonderful. Many notorious under
world characters have left here.
The enforcement of the Prohibition laws through the co-operation
of county and city officers Is bringing convictions of the few
violators. Heavy fines and jail sentences are being meted out.
The abolition of the liquor traffic ai far as the statute provides
is the greatest possible forward step for hundreds of workers who
are now spending their money for food.
Increased Tax Payment of Whisky
Does Not Mean Increased Consumption
CERTAIN newspapers of the coun
try unfriendly to the Prohibition
cause are expressing gratification
over what they profess to believe to be
proof tbat Prohibition has failed. They
refer to the fact that since the first gOf
July last seven states have adopted the
Prohibition policy, and yet during the
first 10 months of the present fiscal
year the United States Government
shows an increase in tax payments on
whisky (our pro-liquor friends call It
Increased "consumption") amounting
to 7,500,000 gallons, but a still further
decrease In the production of beer,
amounting tot 1,500,000 barrels.
These figures seem to fit In wilb the
theory advanced by these newspapers
that increased Prohibition territory
means the shifting of drink consump
tion from beer to distilled spirits. But
in reality it proves nothing of the sort
In the first place, . tax payments on
whisky do not represent "consump
tion" under some circumstances. Given
a settled revenue rate and settled and
regular Importing conditions and tax
payments and consumption meaning
by consumption all the uses to which
whisky and all. distilled spirits are put
have an approximate relationship.
When either or both of the above
factors are disturbed an Increase in
tax payments can have no relation
whatever to consumption. There may
even be an Increased tax payment and
decreased consumption at the same
time. The war has greatly disturbed
the liquor business, so that for months
foreign liquors have not been imported
as they formerly were. Many distillers
of special foreign brands, such as Gor
don's Dry Gin Co. Ltd., of England,
have opened branch distilleries In the
United States. What these firms for
merly sent over as importations now
register as tax paid distillery products
lu the United States. Other purely
American brands are being produced in
increased quantities to take the place
of other foreign brands both here and
abroad because of the unsettled dis
tilling and shipping conditions abroad.
Boston rum of itself represents a dis
tilling and tax-paying revival, which
has no relation whatever to American
"consumption." It goes to debauch
the negroes of Africa, In place of the
now impossible British product. Ships
are being chartered from Boston In this
trade at figures which bring more mon
ey for one trip than it costs to build
the Individual vessels. Eighty thou
sand dollars wast paid on May 15 for
one rum trip to Africa by a ship It cost
but $77,000 to build 12 years ago.

SCENE FROM "BOBBIE OF THE BALLET"
A Special Bluebird Photo Play
AT TEMPLE THEATRE, MONDAY, OCT. 23RD
In Portland, Oregon I
Well may Bonfort's for May 25 have
in black-face type through its pages
the statement that July will be the
biggest whisky producing month Ken
tucky has seen in years, but when the
editor tries to establish any relation
between this and the actual whisky
consumption of the country, he is dis
torting facts. There is no relation
whatever. Shipping and distilling con
ditions abroad are so upset as to affect
the statistics of the whole world.
In addition to this there enters an
other Important factor into the situa
tion which explains Increased tax pay
ments, but does not show increased
consumption. We refer to the state
ment Issued by Secretary of the Treas
ury McAdoo, in commenting upon Com
missioner of Internal Revenue Os
born's report, which report shows an
Increased tax payment of $10,013,140
over the corresponding period of a year
ago. It must be remembered that there
was a tpemendous slump in the rev
enue collections on whisky for the fis
cal year which ended June 30, 1915.
Here Us Secretary McAdoo's statement:
Notwithstanding the spread of Pro
hibition, collections on distilled spirits
for the fir it 10 months of the fiscal
year increased $10,013,140 over the cor
responding period of a year ago. This
is due in great measure to the effective
enforcement of the internal revenue
tax on distilled spirits. It is estimated
that through the campaign of the
Treasury Department against under
gauging, equalizing and blookading in
distilleries, the revenue of the govern
ment lias been Increased by probably
$5,000,000 annually.
The only article of taxation showing
a decrease is beer. Because of the rel
atively low tax on fermented liquore
and the difficulty of getting the un-tax-paid
beer on the market, the Commis
sioner says that the loss in tax on
beer, on account of fraud has been neg
ligible, and that the decrees ie due
principally to the increase In the Pro
hibitlon laws.
In other words the pious distillers
have been defrauding the government.
They have not been paying their full
tax,' and now under a stricter law en
forcement regime, the whisky paid tax
shows an Increase and the pro-liquor
papers are working overtime to make
It appear that this means an Increased
consumption.
The revenue reports show the In
crease In tax payments on whisky, but
there Is absolutely no evidence from
any source to show that there has been
an Increased consumption.
Secretary McAdoo's explanation of
the increased whisky revenue does not
bear out the contentions of the pro
liquor Journals.
' I X
School Commissioner's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
What would you do if you were
County School Commissioner and the
eye test reports kept coming in to in
dicate that many of our school child
ren had less than forty per cent of cor
rect vision and that in many of our
schools 70 per cent of the pnpils have
defective vision. The exact report will
be printed later.
Phelps which is Marion No. 6 is plan
ning a program in celebration of the
big event which is to take place in that
district on Oct. 20th, when they are to
receive their Standard Plate. They
will be the sixth Standard School in
Charlevoix County and the first Stand
ard school in Marion township.
The Angell Day programs and Colum
bus work was interesting diversion in
the visiting schedule this week. Our
teachers are not forgetting the patrio
tism law in reading the Declaration of
Independence of the days required by
the 191 f act.
Things are moving in the County
Normal room. Penmanship practiced
with a vengeance. Special Day pro
gram on the 13th with good reports
from the same. The Com'r was sorry
that work kept her elsewhere.
Are there weeds in your school
grounds or just stones and sticks?
Is your heating system bothering
you on these early autumn days.?
How's the grate? What's the matter
with the chimney? Is it clean?
Hayes and Notwood visited last week
The Hayes teacher's meeting was at
Maple Grove on Thursday afternoon.
Every teacher present in spite of the
storm. Norwood teacher's meeting
was on Friday afternoon. Every
teacher was present, in spite of the
roads.
There are six schools in Hayes twp.
Five of these schools have ventilating
systems, four, of which are good, three
of these schools have some adjustable
seats, and two schools have the scats
correctly placed and to fit all sizes of
children. One school has windows
sufficient in quantity and correctly
placed. Three schools have furnished
sanitary paper towels, and two have
water fountains. All but one have the
approved register and all of them have
some of the recommended texts. One
has approved texts throughout.
There are four schools in Norwood
twp. Three of these have ventilating
systems, two have seats to fit all of the
children, one of which has adjustable
seats for all. There is no school in
Norwood township with correct light
ing, there are no sanitary paper towels
and only one drinking fountain. Part
of the texts books could be approved
and all the registers but one.
Hayes No. 5 has ordered a new water
tank. The walls look pretty good.
The Murray school has the woodwork
painted, the walls tinted, and the floor
oiled. A supply of new seats are at
hand but all have not yet arrived. They
have been correctly arranged for disci
pline and comfort. The grounds have
been cleaned and graded and some of
the new texts books provided.
Hopyard has been more than busy.
Just the finishing touches needed.
Watch for this school later.
There was an interesting little corn
exhibit at Maple Grove.
The Hilton school is equipped with
all adjustable seats for the boys and
girls. A new desk for the teacher has
been ordered and chair to match.
Pretty soon one of two things will
happen. Either the cities will sit up
and take notice or the city will lose its
attraction. Our boys will stay on the
farm.
The following interesting letters
were received this week:
Springvale, Oct. Cth, 1910.
Dear Miss Stewart:
I had the seventh and eighth grades
write letters for their grammarjessons
to-day, telling about our new plan for
keeping our school room in order, com
batting tuberculosis germs, and inci
dentally learning some civics. I select
ed you as a victim and told them that
the best one would be mailed to you.
The sender is a seventh grader.
I saw in the paper that you were
wondering what was being done for
the boys in the way of club work. I
have only three boys but expect to
teach them what I can of manual train
ing when we secure the proper mater
ial. We expect to start a sand table
tomorrow.
Sincerely,
BESSIE ALLEN.
Springvale, Mich., Oct. G, 1916.
Com'r May L. Stewart,
East Jordan, Mich.
Dear Miss Stewart:
I am going to tell you what this school
has been doing for the past week.
Miss Allen was reading to the pupils
about what another school teacher had
made out of their school room.
She read some' suggestions to us and
now we have turned our school room
into a city.
We have named our city 'Busyville.'
We have elected a Treasurer, Clerk,
Street Com'r, Policeman, Board of
Health, Postmaster and Mayor.
We play that the seats are houses
and the aisles between the seats are
the streets.
There is Monroe Avenue, Lincoln
Boulevard, Wilson St., Roosevelt St.,
Washington Ave, and then the aisle
back of all the seats is Rear Alley be
cause it is in the rear.
I will tell you who the officers are,
namely:
Treas. Elizabeth Green
Clerk Nellie Conkright
Sf. Com'r Thelma Milford
Policeman Foster Winberg
Mayor Helen Modie
Board of Health Gladys Green
Postmaster Bertha Conkright
We have our city much more elabor
ate than the one Miss Allen read about
to us.
The work of the street commissioner
is much heavier than that of any other
officer because she has to see that
everyone's house is in perfect order,
and the board of health has a heavier
office than some of the rest because
she has to see thaf"e very one keeps
everything out of their mouth except
food and that they mrst breathe thru
the nose. ,
We have also formed a little club and
we call it the "Busy Bee Sunshine
Club." We meet every Saturday at
different houses and then we expect to
learn to crochet at one meeting, and
then we learn to tat at some other
meeting, and at some other meeting we
learn to embroidery.
We have elected officers for our
little club also, they are:
President Thelma Milford
Vice " Nellie Conkright
Secretary Helen Modie
Treasurer Elizabeth Green
Chairman Miss Allen
We find that our club is as interest
ing as our city. I must close, hoping
this letter will be very interesting. .
Yours truly,
HELEN MODIE.
The Ironton Mother's Club met and
organized Wednesday afternoon. The
Com'r had the privilege of being pre-.
sent to take part in the discussion of
Home Work and School Credits. After
an active and earnest discussion it was
decided that the best results may be
obtained from this work when it is well
directed by both the home and ihe
school. The racing spirit is very good
for an incentive at the start but it is
not desirable that any child try to earn
the year's required credits during the
first two months of school. Whenever
this will interfere with the school work
or the nervous temperament of the
child, regulations should be made by
the teacher encouraging the children
to work regularly and systematically
earning if possible the same number of
credits in exactly the same manner day
by day. The formation of regular and
temperate habits of work is just as val
uable as in habits of eating, resting or
drinking. How would it be if the
teachers of the county would let the
children compete to see which ones
could follow out a definite schedule day
by day for the longest period. It would
be easier for the parents to keep track
of and would be a splendid lesson for
our boys and girls, who are the future
of to-morrow.
