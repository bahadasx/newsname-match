Entered And Worked While
Watched. Booty Sent To Kan
sas City. ' Fought Officers
About as bold robbery by as
bold burglar as has infested this
section for years was committed
v at Brunswick during the street
fair last week by an ex-convict
who gives his name as William
Thompson and who now lan
guishes in the county bastile in
the custody of Sheriff Hurt.
Some time after midnight some
men standing across the street
from Knight and Ruckers store
noticed some one or more at
work in the store among the
goods and these watched the
robbery going on for a time when
officers were summoned and the
store surrounded. The robbers
came out and Thompson was
halted by night watchman for
the city, Ed Murray, whom
Thompson brushed aside and
told to stand away. . The
watchman thrust a big revolver
against the breast of Thompson
and told him he would kill him
if he tried to get away. Thomp
son told him to fire away and
proceeded to wa'k off, goiog
alive.
It was learned that a package
of the goods supposed to have
been taken from the store had
been shipped by express to Kan
sas City and the authorities there
were notified to look out for the
party who called for the pack
age and arrest him.
. Detectives Oldham and Phelan
and patrolman Enright were on
hand when Thompson claimed
the package and placed him un
der arrest and immediately they
encountered about as active
prisoner as ever they tried to
handle. Thompson knocked
them down in rotation and for
fifteen minutes, according to the
Kansas City papers, they had it
up and down and around and
round. Thompson was finally
subdued by being pretty severely
beaten as his condition indicated
when Sheriff Hurt arrived with
the prisoner Monday afternoon.
Jew Shannon, the irrepressible
bootlegging nigger of Brunswick
had been arrested for the same
offense and Sheriff Hurt sent
word to Chief Tisdale to meet
him at Brunswick and assist gett
ing the pair to jail. Thompson
was handcuffed to Shannon and
they were landed in jail Monday
evening.
Thompson has a record. Id
3907 as he was being unloaded at
police headquarters in Kansas
City, tho handcuffed, be bested
four policemen and escaped. He
was captured and sent to the
pen for two years on a similar
charge.
When Thompson was at rested
the last time he had four gold
watches on his person. He was
connected in some way with ' the
show boat wonderland, it is said,
and when at Brunswick with
Sheriff Hurt he wanted to go to
the ' boat but no chances were
taken by the officer nor will there
be with this desperado.
AbouV $125.00 worth of goods
were taken.

Fi
Record Crowds Day and "Night
Carnival and Boat Shows
Big Premium List.
Most assuredly the Commercial
and Business Men's clubs of
Brunswick have cause to be
proud of the effort to entertain
the citizens of he territory from
which trade to that city is drawn,
for the last three days of last
week in that city were sure gala
days, and Saturday broke the
record for a crowd in that city,
according to old residents. We
estimated the crowd attending
the fair and other sights in that
city to be not less than 8000, but
the carnival people said it was
nearer 12,000. Friday the attend
ance was very, great, some be
lieving that there were nearly as
many in the city that day as the
last day of the fair..
The carnival and boat show
did much ' toward filling the city
with visitors, and we unhesitat
ingly pronounce these two at
tractions to be of a higher order
than is generally encountered.
No better natured crowd ever
assembled; every one was jolly
and in for a good time, even the
49er dancers and their subcon
scious partners who kept their
weather eye on the entrance to
get the first glimpse of their bet
ter sixteenths' approach.
The display in the Scott build
ing was, to our mind, the' best of
any, tho the butter entries could
not be beat, and there was some
good stock on hand. The fact
is that the displays in all depart
ments Were much larcer than
had been anticipatedby the mani
agement, and the fair in every
way was a great success.
Basket BalL

more rain and the trip had to be

THE EUROPEAN WAR
An
Even Break in France. -Greece
Is Drawn In.
Another Loan.
The condition of the armies in
France is practically unchanged,
and their relative situations are
about the same as a week ago,
except for small advances made
in spots by the allies and the
capture of a few straggling
scouting bands of German troops.
The main interest is in the
Bulgarian country and the final
attitude of Greece. French have
seized practically all authority on
the island and revolt is under
way, the intrepid-until-now king
dom being torn to shreds so far
as government is concerned.
Austrians have prevented the
Russians and Roumanians from
getting together, and it appears
altogether Germany's way in the
Balkans.
New victories in Russia have
put the German standing several
points forward.
England has applied for another
loan of several millions from this
country.
MEXICO.
While numbers of the Ameri
can troops have been withdrawn
from the border, there are
enough left in Mexico to protect
our people and be on hand for
whatever action becomes neces
sary. Villa is the object again of
a general hunt by Carranza
troops and our own, and until he
is obliterated bodily, hope for
peace is misplaced.
John Ford left for his ranch
at Forsythe, Mo., yesterday;
sorry to leave, but glad to get
home again. If the bridge lum
ber bad been on hand, John's
friends in the Ozarks would not
have seen him for several weeks,
but he refused to wait all winter
for a few more stringers and lit
out, leaving the bridge for some
one else to look after. The best
wishes of his old friends up this
way follow the old horseman and
ladies' man to his dugout in the
south.
District Assembly Rebekahs
Tuesday saw more Rebakahs
at Dalton than will ever be in
that progressive little city again
for years unless the Santa Fe

assembly meeting day and night

Armstrong. Salisbury, this city
and Brunswick and many other
points were on hand and a great
time was had. Miss Syde, a
school teacher from south, Mo.,
somewhere and warden, was on
hand to improve the work and
is praised highly. The Moberly
team did the work and M. S.
Walther and Arthur Friesz from
this city had their hands in thfr
pie, if not as it was connected
with the proceedings, then when
eatin time come. The banquet
served by the Dalton lodge is
complimented by all and our
southwestern suburb did herself
proud in general entertainment.
Marvin Drace returned Mon
day from a visit to St Louis.
John Lewis, our first class
meat market man, leaves for
Sharpsville, Pa., today to make
that city his home. Mr. Lewis
has been here for several years
and by the closest attention to
business; understanding what he
was doing all the time and being
a first class meat cutter, he made
good. His family will follow
him as soon as business matters
'can all be closed up and the
many friends of the family wish
them health and prosperity in
their new home.
