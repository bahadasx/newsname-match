MINING ENGINEER
IS A GAS VICTIM
SORRY TALE
NOW IN STORE
In Upshur County as Republi
cans and Democrats Alike
Are Talking Sutherland.
BUCKHANNOn! Oct."""?Th Re
publican majorities which Upshur
county will roll up thin yoar will be
merely a matter of what per cent of
the Republican overwhelming vote will
go to the poll*, Hughes ???? a popular
selection for nominee for the presi
dency In this county, and Republicans
calmly await election day to glvo him
a majority which It Is confidently ex
pected will tun up to 1.800, not an
exorbitant tlgurc here, whero the Re
publicans have ti normal majority
ranging up to 2,300. Democrats cast
in 1914 only 7.r>!> voles for (lodges for
rongreasinan-at-large, and ho was
given about as large a vote an the
Democrats can muster.
What Is about to happen to William
H. Chilton In this county will be a
sorry tale Indeed. Not only arc Demo
crats talking Sutherland, and Ihc big
vote he will get here among their own
party voters, but the Democratic lead
ers have abandoned everything on the
licket except Coniwell, for whom the
whole light is made. At the same lime
the Democratic headquarters here Is
giving much of Its attention to woman
suffrage, and Is conducting what Is j
known lo bo a bitter light against giv
ing the women tile ballot. In thin city
there are many advocates of woman1
suffrage and the fact that the Demo- ?
cratlc headquarters has gone out of:
Its way to fight the women, something
that is not done In olhcr counties, has
caused a local rumpus among Demo
crats themselves, as Judge .McWhortor
and other leading Domocrats In Up
shur have espoused the cause of suf
frage for women. Judge McWborter
has taken the stump for the women.
Howard Sutherland would sweep the
county with an enormous vote even
If the Democratic organisation did try
to keep down hlB vote. Upshur county i
Democrats fought out the Chllfon
Cornwell battle when organizing, and
the Chilton forces were snowed under.
The Chilton organization In other parts
of the Slate, after the licking they got
here, probably did not expect that a
very warm campaign would be con
ducted for the senator against Suther
land. but they certainly must be get
ting wise by this time that the cam
paign for Chilton has been practically
abandoned 111 Upshur, and all for the
purpose of trying to get vote* for
Cornwell. Nobody In Republican cir
cles here believes Sutherland neods
any help from the Democratic organ
isation, and every Republican knows
that Democrats are merely playing for
an opportunity to boost Cornwell
against Judge Robinson, and Republi
cans do not Intend to be deceived in
the least.
