and that not until the last few days
has there been injected into the fight
the amount and quality of "pep" that
rocs with a well organized and well

is one that has been commented on in
many quarters. And thereby hangs a
tale.

the Protestant ICpiscopal general con
vention here today. The issue, which
arose over the proposal of the com
mission on the enrichment of the
hook of common prayer to add
prayers for the army and navy, di
vided the body inlo two factions.
The prayer which was adopled
and upon which most of the discus
sion was based, was recommended by
the commission. It asked "Lord, Hod
of Hosts, to strengthen and protect
the soldiers of our country: support
them in the day of 1 attic and in time
of peace keep them safe from evil."
It also pleaded that "in all things they
may serve without reproach." A sim
ilar p layer suggested by the commit
tee for the navy, was also adopted.
Clash Over War.
One faction, led by Uev. John How
ard Melish of Brooklyn, held that any
war is un-t hristian and that no sol
dier can serve without reproach. The
other, of which Uev. laighton Parks
of New York, was spokesman, while
not championing war, argued that b
is the duty of.the oiiur-h to pray for
those men who forsake civil pursuits
in which the remuneration might be
greater for the service of their coun
try. Previously, several delegates bad
urged the inclusion nf the ritual of a
prayer for world peace. The Uev.
V. H, Milton of Wilmington. N. '.,
introduced a resolution to this end,
which was referred to the commission
If approved by the House of Bishops,
the prayers for the army and navy
will be in tentative use in Ibe next
three years and will be ailed upon
finally at the next general conven
tion. Injury to Youth.
Dr. Melish said that if these pray
ers were adopted, an irreparable in
jury would be done to the youth of
the nation.
"I do not desire to participate in
a debate on the question of national
preparedness," he said. "But if we
adopt these prayers, we should be do
ing an injury to the youth of this na
tion that i4 irreparable. It is true of
a nation, as it is of an individual, that
whatsoever a man Ihinketh in his
heart, so is he. If we put a prayer
like this before the youth of our na
tion, and make the petitions which
this prayer makis, you are bringing
upon this nation in the years ahead
a catastrophe similar to that which is
now overwhelming the nations beyond
tho Atlantic.
Offers Substitute.
Dr. Melish said he believed in pray
ing for soldiers and sailors and urged
the adoption of the following sub.sli-tute:
Oh Hod, who lias taught us to love
our enemies and to do goon unio
tbem that hate us, bless our soldiers
und sailors for their swift obedience
ind their willingness to answer the
call of duty, but inspire tliein none
the less with a hatred for war, and
may they never for love or private
glory or advancement, provoke its
coining. May our young men still re
joice to die for their country with the
lor of their fathers, but teach our
ago nobhr methods of matching our
strength and more effective w:iys of
giving our life for the flag."
Dr. Melish was supported by the
v. L. Parsons of Berkeley,
Calif., chairman of the commission
which made the recommendation; the
Uev. J. B. Dunn of I,nchburg, Va.,
and Francis I Stetson of New York.
