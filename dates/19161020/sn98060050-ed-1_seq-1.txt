What this country needs today to
bring down the high cost of living is
a more extensive and intensive agricul
ture. Tho production of crops hns not
kept pace with the increase in popu
lation. This is particularly true hero
in Now England. A great exposition
like the one now being conducted in
Springfield, Mnss., will bo very helpful,
and one of its features which ought to
count for improvement in rural condi
tions is tho attention paid to boys nnd
girls on the farm.
One of the big questions before the
next Vermont legislature will be a re
form in our department of justice.
The St. Johnsbury Hepubliean suggests
the merging of the superior judges in
the suptemc court, not to exceed nine
in number, and tho abolition of some
of the municipal courts. Wo all know
that the majority of theso courts
ought never to havo been established.
"Justice" is increasing in cost in Vcr
niont more rapidly th'an bread, milk or
flour. In expenditure for schools, high
ways and public improvements 'the
question is not so much tho cost, as
whether wo got a fair return for our
monoy. In our courts tho cost is in'
creasing constantly without securing
much in tho way of improVoaiont. tUnt
The Holstcin-Priesian Begistor, tho
lending publication in its class in the
country, pays this happily worded trib
ute to tho town in which it is published:
" 'Brattleboro is the Holstcin-Fric-sinn
capital of America,' writes tho
editor of nn esteemed Now York con
temporary to his journal after a visit
'over in good old Now England.' Ho
goes on to describo tho now building
for tho national association now in pro
cess of erection; tho present offices of
Secretary F. L. Houghton nnd tho re
cently completed salo pavilion of the
Pure-bred Live Stock Sales company
whoso vigorous business methods, ho
predicts, will mako Brattleboro 'tho
lending registered cnttlo market in Now
England.' Brattleboro, tho only place
so named in tho country, rich in nnt
u nil beauty and historic association,
tho birthploco of many of tho world's
most distinguished and gifted, thus se
sures a new title. 'Tho Holsteln-Frio-shut
capital of America! ' Only n
student of Holstciu history, a lover
of tlio breed and an owner of these
great - producing, prosperity bringing
creatures, can fully understand how
proud a title this is, or how prognant
with pleasant meaning for tho place to
which it is applied."
Tho Adnmson "eight-hour" law,
which congress enacted at tho impe
rious commnnd of President Wilson,
was ostensibly a measure for tho beno
fit of employes of American railroads.
So, at least, Mr. Wilson represented it,
nnd so tho 20 per cent of tho railroad
employes composing tho Brotherhood
of Railroad Trainmen declnrcd it to be.
It is class legislation of tho most lln
grant sort, to bo sure, but oven that
would not be quite so bad if tt applied
to all, or a great mnjority, of tho work
ers included in tho class in qucstiotl.
Tho opinion entertained by railroad
men themselves concerning this Adam
son law is aptly illustrated by tho of
ficially announced opposition to it of
the Railway Workers' non-partisan as
sociation, and tho demand of that or
ganization that tho law bo repealed
and a convention called to mako an In
vestigation of tho facts involved. The
communication of tho national chair
man of tho association to tho president
of tho Brotherhood of Railroad Train
men, describing tho Adnmson law ns
"tho death knell of thoso economic
organizations, tho railroad brother
hoods," shows conclusively what nt
least 10,000 railroad men think of tho
legislation which Presidont Wilson,
yielding invertobrnto submission to tho
domnnds of 20 per cent of tho coun
try's railroad men, causod congress to
foist upon tho other 80 por cent,

for their fur, but also for tholr llosh.
OFFICER STOPS CARS
Holds Up All Vermont Autos and
Demands to See Licenses
Many Drivers Caught Without Docu
ments, While Interested Crowd
. Smiles from Curbstonos.
V. J. Henry, stato inspector of mo
tor vehicles, landed in town Alondnv
and put in a day in plain clothes look-
lug over the local stock of automo
biles, license plates and the manner in
which local drivers handled their cars
on the principal streets of tho town.
Joxt morning ho appeared at the cor
ner of Alaii nnd Elliot streets in full
official regalia and every motor vehi
cle bearing a Vermont number plate
was held up and the operator of the
machine nsked to produco his opera
tor's license, while an interested crowd
looked on from, tho curbstones and
woro broad smiles.
In tho few hours tho inspector wns
on duty Tuesday morning HO different
drivers were unable to comply with the
request. Their names and the number
of their machines were taken down
with care, and a little memorandum of
their failure to comply with tho law
will be filed with tho secretary of tho
stato for his information. Several
more were caught in the afternoon,
maKing a total or -iu or more.
Ofllcer Henry declined to give out
for publication the names of those who
had aeon round delinquent. It is
known, however, that among those
whose names will be forwarded to the
secretary of the state for not having
their licenses with them as required
by law were laj. F. W. Chllds, who
not long ago fought a chargo preferred
against him of driving his machine
with tho muffler cutout open and won
the verdict.
L. I. Allen found that he bad left his
at homo and went and obtained it. Rev
E. W. Sharp was another victim, whose
name is to bo entered on the book of
records, and so is II. H. Messenger,
chauffeur for L. E. Holden, his HccnBe
being elscwhoro than where the law re
quires it to bo when he is driving a
car.

EXHUMED FOR IDENTIFICATION
Patrick McCarthy Was Drowned Near
Gas Houso Night of July 23 Mrs,
Hayes Will Claim Insurants.
Mrs. Mary Hayes of Ticonderoga, N,
Y., came horo Oct. 12 and caused the
body of Patrick McCarthy, who was
drowned July 23 in tho Connecticut
river nt Brattleboro, to be exhumed for
identification. The body wns buried at
the expense of the town after burial
was delayed nearly two weeks for somo
relative to claim it.
Mrs. Hayes said that she had known
McCarthy a number of years and that
she had paid premiums on an insurance
policy on his life. She had heard ac
cidentally of his death through a friend
and later confirmed tho information by
reading of it in a Vermont newspaper.
She desired to mako certain that the
body was that of the man on whose life
she "had been carrying an insurance
policy, in order to bo in a position to
mako claim for the insurance. She said
that she was no relativo of his, but had
known him many years.
Selectman W- E, Stollman talked
with her andiSho promised to mako
restitution to tho town for the.oxponso
of tho burial when she collected the
policy.
.aicunrtiiy was (irowneu jusi. norm oi

Ho wns in tho company of two other
men and all had been drinking. Mc
Carthy, his companions claimed, stood

ance and fell into tho water. Tho
bodv was recovered tho next morning
by Polico Chief Georgo Wilson and Ar
thur E. Knight, who dragged tho river
with grappling irons.

William E. Wheeler, Farmer in Grove,
Takes Poison in Ills Homo Wlfq
Struck Cup from Ills Hand.
After his wife had knocked from his
hand a cup containing strychnine Wil-
tain E. Wheeler of Grove, a well
known farmer and prominent citizen
of that place, mixed another potion of
tho poison with wnter in his homo Fri
day and in spito of his wife's ef
forts, succeeded in drinking it, with fa
tal results. Mr. Wheeler was 50 years
old.
Mr. Wheeler loaded n wagon with
potatoes Thursday intending to go to
Mrcenlield, Mass., with them next morn-
ng. About a o 'clock he went into tho
houso from tho barn and began mix
ing something with water in a clip.
ills wito asked him what ho was do
ing and he told her correctly. Much
alarmed, Mrs. Wheeler struck tho cup
from his hand, and it was smashed on
tho floor. Mr. Wheelor had a further
quantity of the poison, which he took
from his pocket and swallowed, al
though Mrs. Wheeler made a desperate
attempt to prevent him from doing so.
ur. A. .1. 'lhomas of Jacltsonvillo
was sent for by telephone, but beforo
ho arrived Mr. Wheeler was dead.
Whero the poison was obtained is not
known. " i
What prompted Mr. Wheeler to tako
the fatal dose is not known. For somo
time, however, he had had attacks of
nervousness, and it is thought that
his mind may have been affected. Ho
leaves a wife, who was Marion Ward
of Guilford, daughter of the Into Frank
Ward, and 11 children, eight of whom
live at home. f
He was a native of Grove and al
ways lived there except for a foiv
years when ho lived in Guilford. Ho
went from Guilford back to Grovo
somo 20 years ago.
Last fall his barn was burned after
all tho crops had been harvested and
the silo filled, but the stock was saved.
Shortly afterwards he traded his farm
for the Elliot Green place in Grove,
whero ho had lived sinco. Ho was' a
man of industry and thrift and had
sorved the town in various capacities,
including those .of selectman and school
director.
Tlio funeral was held at tho houso
at 1.30 o'clock Sunday, Rev. W. B.
Tinker of tho Halifax Baptist church
officiating. Tho burial took place in tho
lien cemetery. . .j

concern until such time as the offices in
the American building now occupied by
the Holatcin-Fricsian association are va
cated. As soon as those offices are avail
able the headquarters offices of the Twin
State company will utilize a portion of
them permanently.
Howard u. Ulds, vice president and cen-
cial manager of the company, and Secre
tary G. L. Halstcad were in town batur-
day making the neccssaiy arrangements
and seeking homes for their families. Mr.
Olds, ever since becoming general man

quaitcrs fiom Dover nnd has now brought
us plans to a head. lie says that tlio
offices will be moved just as soon as it is
possible to do so and that he expects to

early in November.
The change will bring several families to
Urattleboto. Besides the families of Mr.
Olds and Mr. Halstcad, II. L. Harris,
traveling auditor; H. T. Kelly, head of the
commercial department; and H, H. Bee

federal supeiintendent of construction,
who has just accepted a position in Wash

will vacate Nov. 1.
The moving of the headquarters of the

which will letain the present quarters in
