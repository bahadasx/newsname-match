THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
No news is good news. So Car as pro
gress is concerned there is but little to
chronicle of this week's operations. The
eannon roar assaults and counter as
•aulta, heavy fighting here and there,
with oB{y dead and wounded as results.
Ail along the lines there have been no
advances of importance as the maps
show.. Perhaps in this particular res
pect the fact that the Austrians have
not made farther progress in the inva
sion of fioumania is the most significant.
For a time it looked as though Rouma
nia was due to suffer as Serbia suffered,
but though threatened at several points
along her boundaries, it is now claimed
that the invaders are checked.
Greece appears to be torn to pieces in
ternally with the practical control of
affairs in the hands of the ententes. A
provisional government favorable to the
allies has been set up but the population
seems divided in sympathies.
The real history of the recent advance
of the British along the Somtne is now
being read in the long lists of casualties
printed in the Canadian papers. These
lists have been coming in for the last
three weeks by the hundreB, one day
being fourtvrta hundred in number,
fiaeh name printed ih tbeee long lists
means sorrow to some Canadian home
and family,
German authorities daim that the
French and English aaeaultB along the
Sommecoet them two million caiualtiee.
This may fee exaggerated to some ex
tent, but »even with large per oent
taken «w«y the loss wenormous. When
it is oowridered what the German-Aus
trian toees must have also been when
we alee compare the probable losses to
the Germans, Austrians, French and
Britishiin the similar Verdun campaign,]
then wre get totals-tint are so gnat tfettj
one wonders why the war does not cram
ble totfragments by its own destnietion.
But we also do know that such debtMO
tion means peace is but question 4f
time «nd not a question of the wishes *f
the .generals or the-statesman in author
ity. The latter may not be ready for
peaoe for some tune yet. but death is
making peaoe in all the fighting forces
right now.
PRESIDENT WILSON AS A GOOD
MAN WHO .HAS KEPT US 4MJT
•F WAR.
The present apolitical campaign has
been remarkably free from muddling or
even bitterness. The candidates er the
presidency are «aen of high character
aod ability. Even. Mr. Roosevelt in.his
emphatic and strenuous way has not at
tempted to malign Mr. Witaoa as to
personal honesty of purpose.
All agree that-Jtfr. Wilson is a ^ood"
man, but sometimes strange and para
doxical or it may mean something less.
A weak man may be a "good awn" in
th«s sense and the very term may ipiply
weakness. Thatuthe president of the
United States should not only be a '{good'
man but should be much more thaa that*
is ^parent.
Strictly speaking therefore, while .we
admit tbatMr..
Wilson is in one sense a
very "good" man yet in another sense,
he is not good because he has not "wade
good?"
.The next, four years will undoubtedly
be erucial years lor
.this country. There
will be war problems, peace problems,
trade, problems, capital and labor prob
lems and world-power problems of more
potentiality that .have ever before con
fronted us. .They will have to be met.
We shall need a strong administration
to deal with these questions. It will
take more than mere goodness to solve
them .it will take a man who has "made
good."
We have.not .the .-ppace, time or pa
tience to recall, all of Mr. W tlson's fail
ures. His successes are so few and un
important they are not worth recalling.
Oh,yes''.'he has kept.us out of war."
As to the. European belligerents there
.has,never been,a moment when there
was any danger of war .with us simply
because they have ail had all they want
ed to do at home. If either of them,
and particularly Germany, had wanted
i.war with the United States they could
.have found plenty of excuses right in
President Wilson's notes. When Ger
many let up on the submarine business
it was because .Mr. Wilson^ first notes
expressed the outraged sentiments of the
American people.as well as. those of other
neutral nations. On .the other hand,
though two yeacs have passed since the
torpedoing of the'"jLusitania" yet noth
ing has been done.about it andijGermany
still claims the right to sink passenger
ships .without warning if she chooses so
to do. The opportunity for the fixing
of the fitatue of submarine warfare was
then with Mr. Wilson, and to .fix it for
all tiue, but it still lies »ith .Germany to
decide whether it will pay or not to«ink
without warning. As the only world
power not at war, it was And is up to
this country to lay down rules of inter
national law when new circumstances
arise which axe not provided for by form
er laws. President Wilson failed in the
4Lusitania" and other cases .immediately
following in which American lives were
lost, in getting anything more than de
lay from Germany.
While with the entente allies the is
sues of diplomacy have not been so ser
ious, yet he has failed in almost every
case to get anything better than to keep
on "watchfully waiting" till the war is
over.
Nothing is more certain among the
belligerani. nations as the fact that ac
cording to Wilson, "We are too proud to
fight." When some innocent non-com
batants, citizens of the United States
are drowned and put adrift in open boats
scores of milesout to sea, when our mails
are robbed, when a submarine blockades
New York harbor, and the President
protests, he is gently and kindly told
that be is too good a man to get into a
fight, so he better go back and sit down
in the shade until the fight is over-and
he does it.
In Mexico the American policy has
Twioe we have sent armed locoes to that
unhappy country.
We presume that this was don* to
keeplhis country **out ot war'' though
usually that is an act ol war. Once our
armed forces after fighting and killing
some Mexicans and having some Amer
icans killed, the troop ships were with
drawn. What they went for, what tbqy
4*ti are still matters of conjecture. But
the democratic papers are saying,
"Mr, Wilson kept us that time out «f
•war." JUBt now there is a large (that is
quite large) American army in Mexioo.
What they went these for and what ih«y
are doing there may be a question -for
the future historians to solve. We have
an army in Mexico, apparently under
orders of the "defacto" government there,
at least in what direction they -shall
march when they do march, which-orders
have already beeu enforced by the*kiUing
and wounding and dispursing of -a oom
pany of tegular -U. S. soldiers. -But
thankfully, "we have been kept -from
war witn Mexioo," The onjy -reason
that we have not been at war wuh Mex
ico is that for the Jast five or «ix .years
there has been
DO
HIGH PRICES.
The high cost of living is a serious
question of tbe day. Every week or
month prices for all commodities grow
upwards. While all wonder why, while
we all wonder when it will-stop, yet each
and all of us are .doing our best to in
crease the general rise.
We buy and sell with commodities,
We use the dollar -as a vehicle but in
realitj we just exchange goods with
each other. It may be labor alone, it
may be wheat,
it
Hence we say, we are all working to
gether to make a "high.coat of living,"
.while we wonder why things rise in
price. If it were not for the great bal
ance wheel trade "supply and de
mand" the upward tendencies of all
.goods would be unlimited. As express
ed in dollars, prices would continue to
soar to unheard of extents—but in the
.final analysis we would still be buying
ten or fifteen yards of cotton oloth with
a bushel of wheat. A day's common
labor would buy so many pounds of
flour, so much tea or coffee, or a pair of
shoes. So that after all, things would
not .relatively cost more but the dollar
price .would be larger.
•But in this upward scaling of prices,
all things do not rise equally or propor
tionately. Usually, labor comes last,
and .other things vary much in the up
hill race.
But history proves that sometime this
upward movement will stop and that
prices will fall again. At the present
time no one believes that prices will or
can remain .as high as now many are
looking for a.reversal when peace comes.
Undoubtedly the close of this great war
which haa caused demands on labor and
manufacturing that has to a consider
able extent demoralized the general
course of trade and commerce, will have
an equally demoralizing effect when the
demand for war material ceases.
But the rise in prices cannot be-al
together blamed to the war. The trend
upwards was very strong for several
years before the war. Critics of social
economy differ in their prophesies of the
future and they may well be uncertain
because of so many new elements that
will appear when peace is declared.
Several millions of men will be turned
into the paths of peace and instead of
destroying will become producers. The
poverty of tbe nations of tbe old world
after the expenditures and waste will
also be a factor in several ways. The
question of immigration and emigration
is also being discussed. Many of the
ruined peasantry will desire to come to
America, while on the other band many
Europeans now here will go back to help
restore and find abetter market for their
labor across tbe water in tbe work of
restoration.
In this article we are not trying to
answer the questions raised as to why
and when ot high prices, but just to

Mexico, iecause

But we tire. These things have been
in the newspapers for years and months.
The history proves that while.Mr. Wilson
may be a "good man" that he is weak
and vacillating. We have .plenty of
troubles coming. Do we want a .good

But each person has something to

possible for what he has to sell and to

certainly need a steady hand at 'the
wheel, trained offioers and expert sailors.
Tbe contests of peaoe are greater' than
those of war. Shall we keep our doors
wide open to European trade or shall we
.put guards at the doorways? Shall we
admit all sorts of goods free from Europe
in competition with our own labor, not
withstanding any tariffs that they may
employ against us? In the peace times
before the war broke out the democratic
tariff failed as a commercial enterprise
and failed as a revenue measure. 'What
will be its effect when the war conditions
cease? We -want to bny and sell but let
us share in-making prices.
Democratic free trade means for trade
to care for-itself. Republican protection
means that we protect our trade. We
will need protection after this war.
Voters, help make prices in November.
DON'T -SUPPORT THE
COUNTY TICKET.
The. Nonpartisan Leader, the official
organ ot tbe Nonpartisan party, came
out .last week in a leading editorial dis
claiming any interest in or supporting
•any'county candidates for office. The
«ame they contend about the national
ticket. The following is an extract from
the. editorial:
"The League has not indorsed any
candidates f6r the United States senate
or for congress. It is not supporting or
opposing either Hughes or Wilson. It
is not taking any part in national poli
tics nor in county politics. Don't be
misled about this. If anybody tells you
,4the
League is for Hughes," or "the
League is lor McCumber," or "the Lea
gue is for Burke," or "the League is for
Wilson," tell him he is mistaken."
We understand that some uf tbe
local
candidates are working the Nonparusau
idea very strong by claiming they are en
dorsed by tbe league.
.Inasmuch as the Nonpartisan Leader
.goes to practically every member of the
organization, we call their attention to
the editorial on page 13 for verification
of our statement.
The New York World, most rabid of
Hughes haters, is much perturbed be
cause Republican papers are quoting
from tbe will of its former owner, the
late Joseph Pulitzer, naming Hughes as
one of the executors of his estate. The
World says that Pulitzer may have con
sidered Hughes a good man for executor
of his estate, but that does not indicate
an qpinion that he would make a good
president. Now comes the disclosure
that Pulitzer not only wanted Hughes to
serve as an executor, without bonds, in
managing an estate that included the
World property, but also piedicted that
he would some day be President And
Pulitzer was a far wiser man than the
present managers of the World.
Is there any significance in the fact
that the next day after it was announced
that former Republican senator Henry
Clay Hansborough would come to North
Dakota and take charge of the Wilson
Clubs—rineteen legislative candidates
on the Democrat and Socialist tickets
withdrew from the field?—Mountaineer,
