WHAT WOULD
HAVE DONE?
. 'Teach me that all success and
every livable condition of life come
only from constant endeavor and long
sustained effort; teach me to-succeed
that I must subject myself to the
fierce fires of intellectual and physic
al endeavor, that I must walk while
other ride, and that like "Cascarets,"
I must work while others sleep."
The above is an extract from an ad
dress delivered by Hon. Henry F.
Ashurst to the graduation class of
New Lexington, Ohio, high school,
November 24, 1915.
Tho senator appeared before the
local high school yesterday, upon tho
invitation of Prof. Cook, head of that
institution. His address was of the
usual oratorical brilliancy, fairly
bristling with smiles, metaphors and
allusions to the beauties of nature.
The students were profoundly im
pressed with his method of talking,
and at the end of the-lecture gave him
a round of applause.
In his Bpeech the senator did not
go into the mysteries of the popular
patent medicine as he did in Ohio. He
confined himself to "Preparedness,"
touching upon the benefits to be ac
crued from an education such as the
local high school can give.
It is a safe bet that if the senator
had unwittingly slipped in his flow of
comparisons, as he did in the east, he
would have received the wildest dem
onstration in the history of his career
on the stump. The students at P. U.
H. S. are always up to date, and many
of them had read the Congresisonal
Record, containing Mr. Ashurst'R
famous "Caccarets 'talk. They be
lieved that anyone, especially a sena
tor, who would have nerve to spring
that on them, was deserving of all he
could get.
In regard to the speech delivered in
the east, at the, time of the historical
event, several letters were received
here telling of the affair, and relating
the astonishment of his audience
when he blandly made his remarkable,
statement, and went ahead probably
in ignorance of what he had said.
Phoenix Republican.
Will L. Clark Resigns as
Manager of United Verde
Will L. Clark, who is well known
0 in Flagstaff, has resigned his position
as manager of the United Verde Cop
per Co., at Jerome and Robert Talley
has been made manager of the big
concern.
Mr. Clark has had the management
years and was considered one of the
best men in the business and one who
held in the highest esteem by those
working under him. He has not giv
en out his intentions as to the future
but he will not take, the management
of any other mining company.
. Make the Squirrels Do the Work
Gathering pine nuts (pinyons) is
a popular-pastime in the south end of
Apache county right now. These little
nuts are not an abundant crop oftener
than every third or fourth year, but
i there are great lots of them this sea
son and nutting parties with picnics
and good company are common from
Springerville and Eager. A little later
on, when the rats and chipmunks have
laid in their winter supply, the nut
gatherers will make their richest
hauls by robbing the homes of these
industrious little rodents. Every
family in the south end of "Old Ap
ache" will have sacks of fiuts laid by
- when winter comes. St. Johns Ob-

Calf Food a Costly Diet
Four young men who rambled up
into the country south of Williams
last week from Phoenix in quest of
game, did not, fully realize the des
perate chances they were taking when
they murdered a calf on the range be
longing to Nio Perkins' company. Not
especially because the calf belonged
to Nic, but that cattlemen make it a
duty to frown severely on killing
range stock.
Tho whole iour were arrested for
the deed, which is a felony, by Un
dcrsheriff ,F L. Dickinson and later
' brought to Flagstaff. Monday they
were taken to Williams for a pre
liminary hearing where one of the
men, Weedman, agreed to the killing
of the calf and was put under $2,000
bonds; the others were held under
$300 bonds to appear as witnesses.
None of the men fully realized the
seriousness of "murdering" beef on
the range, but happened to be out of
meat and thought it would be a good
joke on the calf. While they would
t be willing to go pretty high on the
i price of beef to settle the affair, the
-law stepped in and prevented the set
tlement on a real meat basis.
WANT HUNTERS TO WITCH
FOR BUNDS ON WILD DUCKS
t-
l
If you kill or capture a wild duck
bearing an aluminum band around
one leg, having a number on one side,
and on the other a statement request
ing that the United States Depart
ment of Agriculture, or'the Biological
Survey, be notified, you are requested
to send this band at once to the Bu
reau of Biological Survey, Depart
ment of Agriculture, Washington, D.
C. This band, if accompanied by a
statement as to .date, place, and cir
cumstances under which the bird was
taken, will be of service to the Sur
vey in its efforts to determine the
longevity of individual ducks and the
routes of migration of the species.
The bands" are being attached to con
siderable numbers of wild ducks of
several species which have been cured
of the duck sickness prevalent around
Great Salt Lake, Utah, and; there re
leased. The department is particu
larly anxious to secure reports from
these birds to determine their com
plete recovery from this malady
which has killed hundreds of thou
sands of ducks in Utah.
WOULD HAVE FEWER AND
BETTER LAWS FOR STATE
T. H. Cureton, the republican can
didate for state representative, has
taken as his slogan: "Fewer and
Better Laws," which undoubtedly
Bhould be sanctioned by voters of all
political parties. By education and
profession Mr. Cuerton is ably fitted
to carry out such a platform to the
satisfaction of his constituents and
give them the benefit of his especial
ability.
He is a candidate of no especial in
terests and will make it his sole pur
pose of representing the whole peo
ple of the county, east and west,
north and south and the business' in
terests of all.
The school laws nf the state need a
most generous revamping and going
over and since he is an educator by
profession, the northern part of thr
state would undoubtedly receive a
better and more equitable adjustment
of these laws which are costing the
people of the north; "taxation with
out representation." Aside from the
fact that he has spent years as an
educator, Mr. Cuerton was admitted
to the Arizona bar one of the first
after statehood was granted Arizona.
He is an active, able man and one
who will undertake the obligations
placed upon him by the people of
Coconino county as a trust of honor
from the whole people and endeavor
to convince them by his work rather
than by his words.
MISS LENORE FRANCIS FOR
COUNTY SUPT. OF SCHOOLS
Miss Lenore Francis, the present
encumbent in the office of County
Superintendent of Schools, received a
handsome vote at the hands of the
democratic voters at the primary
election, even though she had no con
testant against her.
Miss Lenore is a native born Flag
staff young lady, who is a graduate
of the Normal. Shc also spent two
years in one of the best known young
ladies' seminaries in New York be
focr taking up the work o teaching
in Coconino county.
During the past two years she has
given every effort to the building up
of the schools of the county and ow
ing to the rapidly increasing popula
tion, has had many difficult problems
to handle in securing new districts
and new buildings for the care of the
children. It has been a strenuous two
years, but she has accomplished good
results.
The propcr supervision of the
schools of the county and the results
obtained in tho different schools, is a
most important duty and one in
which the direct heart-interest of
every parent in the county is most
closely involved.
Miss Francis is earnestly seeking a
retuftj to the office of county superin
tendent for the coming two years and
is confident that her record of the
past two years is such as will give
her the support of tho people with
whom vshe has dealt during the past
two years.

Phoenix, made the local lodge of
Knightg of Pythias an official visit
last Wednesday evening.

Knights to greet him and to enjoy
his very interesting address on the
good of the order.
Preparations had been mailo and
at the conclusion of the regular busi
ness meeting, there was a banquet
given in honor of the visiting official
at which all hands took turns . in
speaking for the good of the order.
DR. LOWELL DELIVERS
LECTURE ON MARS
University of Washington (Seattle)
Oct 9. "That the planet Mars is in
habited by human beings is no more
merely problematical but a positive!
fact," was the message delivered to
the students of the University of
Washington, at Seattle, by Dr. Ferci
val Lowell, noted astronomer, and
student of the heavenly bodies.
Dr. Lowell by the use of stereop
ticon slides, taken from the Observa
tory at Flagstaff, demonstrated clear
ly that the canals, which are visible
on Mats are of geometrical regularity
and therefore artificial and construct
ed by human beings. These slides are
among the most marvelous of scien
tific achievements along the astrono
mical lino because of the great diffi
culty encountered in photographing
them.
Prof. Lowell, unlike many famous
poets and philosophers, does not spe
culate on the theory that Mars is in
habited but affirms his assertion,
based upon the grounds of absolute
science, and his thirty years of scien
tific observations. Plato thought that
Mars was inhabited but that the
dwellers were spiritual beings. Dr.
Lowell contradicts this view, saying
the handiwork of the human being is
plainly visible from his observation
on the planet.
Engineers, Too
The Martian canals are plainly vis
ible upon the slides exhibited by the
astronomer. Dr. Lowell declares as a
foundation for his belief of the in
habitance of Mars that in order to
construct canals as seen upon the J
surface of Mars the inhabitants must
have had bodily strength, must have
had intelligence, especially as to the
essentials of engineering.
The longest canal on Mars, accord
ing to Dr. Lowell, is 31 CO miles in
length, about one-seventh of the dis
tance around the world.
Dr. Lowell has observed approx
imately 500 of these canals. Their
main purpose, he says, is no doubt'
similar to that of the canals on
earth, with the main canals used for
irrigation purposes and some for
water transportation.

A New American Log
Loader for the F. L. Co.
The Flagstaff Lumber Company re
ceived a new American steam log
loader for their work Monday which
was twisted off onto their logging
road in the afternoon. The new load
er is not only an addition but an im
provement in their equipment that
will save time and money in getting
logs onto cars and keep the busy lit
tlo logging road busy during the
coming winter months.
The Flagstaff Lumber Company re
cently cut down expenses by elimina
ting the word "Manufacturing" in it's
cognoman and is now legally "The
Flagstaff Lumber Company."
INTERESTING
TO UNIVERSITY
It is a well-known fact that on
Mars all bodies of water dry up and
these canals are absolutely essential
for irigation purposes. The result of
this irrigation on the planet is vege
table life, which also has been ob
served by the astronomer, and is the
second point in his belief that Mara
is inhabited by human beings.
Canals Easily Traced
The canals are easily traced by the
growth of dark vegetation along their
courses. The magnitude, of these
canals may be estimated and appre
ciated by the fact that a strip ten
miles wide is irrigated by them in
their course, and then there is plenty
of vegetation, which up to the present
time have been regarded as great
seas or bodies of water' on the planet.
The Panama canal is forty miles
in length, and the greatest distance
traveled by a Martian canal is more
than 3000 miles, and it irrigates a
strip of territory ten miles wide, be
sides furnishing water for vegetation
purposes.
By the changing color of dark
masses on Mars, Dr. Lowell shows
lhat the vegetation is a brillinat
green in the spring and of a darker
hue in the fall, when vegetation dies,
Dr. Lowell says that this same con
dition would exist if an inhabitant of
the planet were to look through a
telescope upon the land mass of the
United States and could trace the
ripening of the grain and its death
by the changes in color of the land
mass.
No Real Mountains
By watching the. morning and ever
ing chadows creep across the face of
the planet, Dr. Lowell has determined
that there are no mountains on Mars
or elevations of any considerable
height. If there were high elevations
they would throw a distinct shadow
across the illuminated spot, but this
does not occur, and the majority or
the land mass of Mars is broad and
flat, which is further brought out by
the numerous canals.
Dr. Lowell estimates the mass of
Mars to be one-ninth of that of (
earth and about four-sevenths its
diameter.

REPUBLICAN COUNTY
GANDiDATESJVIAKING 600D
The different republican candidates
for county offices have been doing
good work for themselves during the
past two weeks and have been "see
ing" the voters in all sections of the
country. They are bringing back
good reports from all sections, and it
is evident from their information that
the republican ticket will receive the
majority support throughout the
county.
Cameron and Garing have both
been gathering strength among the
voters during the past- two weeks.
There are no strings on either of them
and the .people are certain of a square
deal if they are elected to care for
the business of tho county during the
next two years. Both are competent
and know the kind of work the people
want done without being compelled
to do it
Judge Layton, who is probably one
of the oldest timers in this section of
tho country, will be elected Justice of
the Peace, according to the story that
is being talked by the people general
ly. There is no question as to his
ability, knowledge of law or willing
ness to give each and every one a
square deal; he has had no other in
terest than the best interest of the
people.
Wm. Beeson has received encour
agement from all sections of the
county he has visited and no one
doubts his ability to handle the office
of county treasurer. He has lived
here the greater part of his life and
has never held a salaried office, and
has never asked for one heretofore.
Mrs. Bozena (Fred) Allen, the re
publican candidate for the office of
county superintendent of schools, is
making a splendid race for the place
and is well pleased with the results
of her different trips over the country.
She has not only the ability to pro
perly care for the school interests,
but has been fitted for it by educa
tional advantages as well as with na
tural advantages. She would be
thoroughly interested in her work and
would give tby parents of the county
a good business administration.
SELLING STOCK IN A BIG
BONANZA PROPOSITION
Mrs. Neal and Mrs. Esslinger, two
Phoenix ladies who have been selling
stock in the Arizona Bonanza Mining
Company, for the past week, left for
Winslow the first of the week where
they will continue the good work
they started here. The mining com
pany they represent is said to be one
of the coming properties of that rich
mining district, where the low grade
properties have made millions for the
stockholders during the past ftw
years.
The properties in which they arc
interested are situated about six miles
northerly from the town of Superior
and the famous Magma mine, and but
two miles from the famous "Old Sil
ver King" which has a record of pro
ducing over fifteen million dollars for
its owners.
The district is one of the richest
in copper of the whole state and mil
lions are being taken out of the
ground every year by adjoining pro
perties. It is one of the big proper
ties the organizers of the company
are trying to develope, and experts
aro confident that they have the vast
body of ore necessary to make it one
of the big paying propositions of Ari
zona. EMERSON SCHOOL NOTES

AGITATING ADEQUATE
POSTOFFICEjNTO REAIIN
Senator Ashurst has inspected the
local postoffice conditions; Congress
man Hayden has inspected the local
postoffice conditions, a postofflce in
spector has inspected the Flagstaff
postoffice conditions; the people local
ly know what the conditions are; bills
have been introduced in congress
though they never seem to get ac
quainted with appropriation fund;
the proposition of adequate quarters
has been "agitated" some at the
suggestion of Senator Ashurst and
Congressman Hayden thinks that
there should be some improvement
Senator Ashuret really offers the
best remedy. That of "agitating"
the question. If the voters conclude
that his suggestion is correct, they
should not only agitate the question
but put in some of their time right
now "agitating" Senator Ashurst
and Hayden because they have no
especial interest in the affairs of the
people of Flagstaff until they get
really aggresively "agitative" as it
were and cause them real political
uneasiness.
The uneasiness and trouble that the
people of Flagstaff are put to in
order to secure some Bort of postal
service, is an nothing to them; "agi
tate," if you want anything, but they
fail to understand that the agitation
should extend to each and every re
presentative in congress and that the
people of Flagstaff should show their
displeasure by their votes at the com
ing election.
If they represent us, why should
we do the "agitating" in or.der to at
least secure decent service, which ac
cording to figures given, show, that
we are paying ten fold for it?
The place to put your cross should
be where there are no names of men
who believe you should "agitate" in
order to get some sort of a' reason
able service; service that you are not
only paying for as tothe postoffice,
but for representatives of the people
in congress.

Sheriff Newman will be Sheriff Again
Sheriff R. L. Newman, the young
man of Navajo county who has made
the laws of that county mean what
they said as far as lawyers and judg
es would construe them, was in Flag
staff Tuesday visiting old time
friends, aside from a small matter of
criminal business.
Lee has been a resident of North
ern Arizona since 1877, the greater
portion of which time he spent in Co
conino and Navajo counties in the
sheep and cattle business. He is again
in the race for sheriff in our neigh
boring county and has many friends
over here, both republican and dem
ocratic who are willing to testify to
his sturdy character and ability to
deliver the goods no matter how hard
the proposition he may be up against.
In Navajo county he has attained
the reputation of enforcing the laws
just as they are written so far as he
is concerned, letting them hit or hurt
as they would, claiming that it was
what he was elected for, and not to
Bay what should or should not have
been the law.
Old time boyhood friends over in
this section of the country feel a
friendly interest in his campaign from
a personal standpoint and are willing
to wager on his ability, integrity and
loyalty to his constituents at any
point along the line of duty.
