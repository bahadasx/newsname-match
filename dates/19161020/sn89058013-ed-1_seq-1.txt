SUFFRAGE NEWS NOTES.
BY LILLIAN PEKRINE DAVIS.
With the McKenzie league plan
ning a demonstration for October
21, following the Huntingdon celn
ebration of two weeks ago, Carroll
County bids fair to lead the Eighth
Congressional District for suffrage
if some of the other counties do not
look to their laurels.
October 7 and; 21 were set apart
as Federal Amendment days, to be
celebrated all over the country in
the States where -equal suffrage
does not prevail. In Nashville an
elaborate program was arranged on
the steps of the capitol as the con
tribution of the Nashville league
to the observance of the first date.
Speaking upon that occasion Dr.
Gus Dyer of Vauderbilt University
made a number of observations
worthy of thoughtful consideration
by both pros and antis. Dr. Dyer
began with the statement that
womau's suffrage may be regarded
as practically an accomplished
fact, its ultimate use being but a
question of time and method. He
then spoke of the duties which the
ballot would place upon women,
and of the evil effects of the activity
of the women who are making an
effort to shirk the responsibilities
of citizenship, and to cause others
to shirk it by opposing votes for
women. He pointed out what
would be the feelings of men if
any movement should be set on
foot to deprive "them of the ballot,
and spent the rest of his ten min
utes in a discussion of the inherent
qualities of women by which they
wonld be able to make their cit
izenship serve the truest needs of
society, concluding with this very
true statement:
"Women ate far better fighters
than men. Men may be aroused to
make a bold dash in one campaign,
but if they fail to win they either
surrender or compromise. It does
not discourage women to fail if
they believe they are right, and
hey won't cousider a compromise.

COOPER,
CHEATHAM, Directors. Y
to before me, this 16th day of jt
GRAHAM, Notary Public. X
This quality is a powerful asset in
politics. Women give a much lar
ger place to divine influence in
their movements. Faith in God
and faith in the power of doing
right are powerful factors in suc
cessful political reform, and in this
women are superior to men.""
When the call for funds came in
the national convention, second on
the floor was Mrs. Dudley to prom
ise for Tennessee $25,000. When
the women of, a State want any
thing bad enough either to give or
to raise a sum of that size for it,
theywant it enough to keep the
fight going till they get it.
Hon. E. E. Fulghum of Jackson,
Democratic nominee for the Sen
ate from the twenty-sixth district,
who is running without opposition,
has shown his respect for the wom
en of his State, in a practical way,
in his recent suffrage declaration.
Jackson suffragists are jubilant
over Mr; Fulghum's statement, s
this makes Madison County solid
for suffrage in the General Assem
bly. Her two direct representa
tives, Hon, R. S. McClaran and
Hon. J. E. Blackmail, voted for
the suffrage amendment in the
House of Representatives in 1915.
It is said by those who have
tried it that the dark looking soil
being excavated by the railroad
company at the 3-mile cut makes a
fine fertilizer. Pitty it is not used
on some of the poor farms nearby
Camden. '
Subscriptions are taken at The
Chronicle office for all the.leading
American aud foreign magazines
and periodicals at lowest rates.
The school yard is being put in
tiptop shape. After it has been
leveled the ground should be well
rolled and kept smooth.
Miss Mattie Rye of Nashville -is
spending a few duys in Camden
with old friends.
Alonzo Berry was at Eva City
one day this week.
