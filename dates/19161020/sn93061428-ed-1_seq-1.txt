If you had a business that had
ben ma Incomptently for period of
year at a losa of torn 33,0O0, with
only $17,000 in permanent improve
tnente added:
- And if you handed that business
ovtr to a new manager:
- And if after a similar period of
year ha cut the coat of operation
while doing- twice the bualneaa, broke
even and handed you over a clean
alate and $32,000 worth of perman
ent improvements:
Wouldn't you be pretty enthulas
tie over that business manager T
That'! what John B. McManus,
democrat, appointed by Democratic
Governor William C. McDonald, has
done with the New Mexico Sute
Penitentiary ai Ita superintendent
That' a sample of the kind of
business management that taxpay
ers' business has bad under the demo-
, eraUc.fcdminlstration of honety, econ
omy and eflklency.
There have been no$4,000 errors in
bookkeeping in the McManus manage
neat of the state prison. NO refolds
..haro teen destroyed; no shortage
have had to be made good to the
state; no expensive litigation has
beta onUiled and the prison superin
tendent has never needed "vindica
tion." . tie la what John B. McManus,
democrat, the appointee of Governor
HoDonnid has done with the state
pealtentiaryi
la the period from 1000 to 1912,
whfc an annual appropriation of $35,.
OH bad to be made for the peniten
tiary. la the period from 1012 to 1916,
wit an Increase in number of con
vict per day haa been reduced from
day has been reduced from a.x'y
60 cent to 40 cents; tho total ex
penditures were leu in 1915 than in
1911, and .permanent improvements
were made worth $32,000 as compar
ed with $18,000 from 1907 to 1912.
In 1911 it cost about $102,000 to
run, the penitentiary with 308 con
vicU; the number is now 426 and with
75 in 19(5 it cost only $99,000. In
1911, $4600 was put into permanent
improvements and the deficit app o
priation was $16,300; in 1915 $9500
was put into permanent improvements
and there was no deficit.
The remarkable increase in econ
omy is best shown by comparison
with the year $905 when the annual
by the legislature.
There were only 220 convicts in
1905.
In 1916, with 426 eonvieta or an .in
crease of 93 per cent, the peniten
tiary ia run, without a deficit, on the
sun appropriation.
This ia business management; hon
est, efficient business management of
the democratic kind And at forty
is cent a bead the convicta are bet
ter fed, and treated more humanely
than at sixty cents bead,
appropriation waa flrst made $35,000
the convicta are better fed and treat
ed more humanely than at sixty cents
a head.
ESCAPES DECREASE.
Notwithaanding an increase of the
. total daily average penitentiary popu.
lation from 278 to 426, and an increase
of those working on roads from 34 to
80, the net loss by escapes waa 10 in
191? nd IS in 1916 as compared to
22 in 1911, the year before McManus
took charge. There' were 42 escapes
in 1911; the highest McManus has
had is 31. In 1909-11, seven per cent
f the eonvieta escaped.
Governor McDonald Issued 17 par-
and 19 conditional pardons on
-"well considered grounds of humanity
and Justice. In the preceding slml.
la? period 5$ outright pardons were
Jawed.
In the paat year 63 per cent of the
paroled prisoners have wade good and
justified their parole. This is the
moat significant itera in the
splendid shewing by Warden Me
Maus, as showing the admirable mor
als pf the institution and that Instead
of turning out confirmed criminals it
is turning out men who are really at
tempting to be good eitisena
There ia no more powerful and un
answerable argument for the re-election
of democratic state meláis than
the democratic record of penitentiary
management.
If the voters want the McDonald
and the McManus type of public ser
vice they should roll up an over
whelming majority for the clean, hon
eaty capable democratic candidate.
If they want the Bureum type of
public service as exemplified in H. O.
Buraum's management of the state
penitentiary the kind of public ser.
vice that defeated him when he ran
for governor in 1911, they can get it
by voting for Mr, Bursum and his tic
ket Which will theyehoose on Novem
ber. A new state has no more powerful
attraction to prospective setieis and
home builders than good schools.
Thanks to five years of intelligent
and progressive domocratk adminis
tration the new state in the year
1915-16 spent two and a third mil
lions of dollars on the eduratinn of its
boys and girls, its young men snd
women.
Under up-to-date and efficient
democratic administration the new
state la spending nearly twice as
much money on the education of each
boy and girl aa it did when New Mex
ico waa admitted to the union. The
per capita- expenditure for the total
school census has increased in that
tima from $9.60 to over $16.00. The
school population has increased a lit
tle more than 10,000. The number of
school districts ha increased from
1,000 to some 1,500.
In 1912 over half the school districts
held not less than a aeven months'
term and the average term is over
eight and a half months. '
In 1912 the average salary for men
te adherí was $369.68 per year and for
women $389.8$. That year, 438 out
of 1598 teachers received less than
$200 per year. Now no teacher get
less than $350 per year and the av
erage annual salary for all is $507.
In 1912 the state spent $954,407.73
on ita public elementary and high
schools.
In 1916 the state spends on these
schools $1,785,484.00.
In 1912 the state spent on other
educational institutions the sum ot
$380,713.06.
In 1916 it has increased this sure
to half a million dollars.
In 1912, 788 districts owned thtlr
school houses, 219 rented quartern,
often poor and unsanitary and inade
quate. Few of the school buildings
in rural communities were suited for
school purposes.
Through state aid for school pur
poses, practically every one of the
1500 schol district now owns its own
building, modern, substantial, sani
tary, well lighted, ventilated, heated
and equipped.
Industrial and agricultural educa
tion are being Introduced into the
schools. The standard required of
teachers has been steadily raised.
Fsnn clubs, Industrial clubs, plsy
grounds, social centers and other up-to-date
features are being adopted.
Night schools are educating the el.
derly illiterate; the standard of liv
ing is being improved through the
schools; home conditions are being
made better.
Education in New Mexico under
democratic administration is reach
ing Into every humble home; making
life mean wore to the parents and
preparing the youth to become eltlx.
ens who will make New Mexico the
greatest state in the union.
The state of New Mexico 'under
wise democratic guidance ia opening
the door of opportunity wide to every
boy and every girl in New Mexico; it
is extending a helping hand to every
young man and woman; it is build
a glorous future for this great com
monwealth. .
New Mexico's life and her destiny
are bound up in her splendid schools.
What helps them helps every cititen,
every man and woman and child.
What Iniures them, what retard the
growth of education, injures every
person within "the borders of the
tUte.
Under ; democratic admlnlstratno t
Under democratic ' administration
since New Mexico's admieaion to the
union, her schools have been fostered
and built up more than ever befure;
the educational system has been en
larged and improved and brought up
to date, it has been administered ef
ficiently and economically and the
taxpayers have receved dollar's
worth of edjeation for every dollar
that has gone Into the school funds.
New Mexloe hhe ddvneed in leaps
and bounds towsrd the front rank of
the states in educational matters.
It U a record which has attracted
the attenton of the nation and of
wheh the people of New Mexico may
well -be proud.

Something Different But Just Right

PENSLAR
Now, I believe no Intelligent man
will hestitste to answer the following
questions affirmatively.
Can not the same standards of
right and wrong be applied to men
enmasse that are applied to the in
dividual man? Then a party of men,
taking a stand on any matter, is eith
er In the right or n the wrong, Is it
not? If the wrong, should it not, for
the sake of progress and enlightment
be willing to hear and follow the
right? And If In the right; can any
thing the opposition may say Injure
the right? Is it not true that, if the
opposition be in the wrong, lie own
attempts to justify itself will reveal
ita own weakness and error and there,
by indirectly aid the right?
If these quentions are answered af
firmatively (and they cannot be an.
swered otherwise), then this follows
aa Inevitable conclusion: The man
who opposes giving his opponents a
fair hearing (assuming him to be in
telligent) either admits that he con
siders his own side as in tbs wrong
or else that he considers the general
public so incredibly stupid and docile
that it can be led about by the nose.
This is an age of more or less uni
versal education. No one today can
make misstatement of fact and get
by with it Any attempt to do so will
promptly result in one's undoing. If
any party of men la in the wrong, the
best defense it can offer is that of
absolute silence.
I am aoqualnUd with the great
dailiee of about a dosen of the larg
est cities in the United States. I do
not know of one that has ever refused
to sell space to ita opponents. Most
of them give their opponents choice
of position, excepting only the flrst,
and sometime the second page.

the opposition to freely advertise in
their columns. Now, this wss not
really necessary, as each aide of the
question ,toas championed by one
daily paper. But in order that ALL
the voters in the city might hear
BOTH SIDES of the matter, each
paper opened its columns to the oth.

their 'complete faith in the causes

The talk of "Judas selling out for
thirty pieces of silver" sounds like
thirty cents. It savors of the Dark
Ages, and besides it is not a compli
ment to the intelligence of the read

The School and Institution Lands
Waste of Near Mexico.
Hon. H. B. Fergusson and B. 8.
Rody, fought for years in Cong-res
on behalf of New Mexico to get pro
per recognition of the state's educa.
l tonal system in the enabling
act for the expected state
tax would ever have been nec
essary, if the lands given, were
properly husbanded. The annual
income would have been simnlv on.
pulent But in 1912 the "'Interests'
went quietly before our legislatura
and got through vlllaniou law, by
wmcn au the school and Institution
land of the state (15236 Code 19151
could be sold at $3.00 per acre, one
tenth cash, and balance in 80 annual
instalments with Interest at 4 per
cent, which reckoning money worth
8 per eent in thirty years brings tha
price received down to about $1.50
per acre.
In such a hurry waa Ervlan l II
these lands, that ha sold them and
gave possession even before the
lands were "clearlisted" by the n.
tional government to the state. Re.
suits: Ervlen after takng the 10
per cent flrst payment on these sales
of hundreds upon hundreds of thou
sands of acres of these lands, con
cluded that this "first-payment"
money waa not state money and so
refused to put It Into the state
tressury to draw interest, and so he
deposited it with his banker friends
without Interest and without security
throughout the state. He now has
thus deposited about three quarter
of a million of dollars!, and it Is in
creasing every day.
God help the common schools of
the state of New Mexico, for they-j
are being robbed! I
The Springr-Hhwkin-Burum
mining tonnage-tax law of 1915 of
New 'Mexico (Chapter 55 Session
laws N. M. 1915.)
Is one of the most iniquitous laws
ever "put over" by special interests
on a long suffering people. Under
it, more property escapee all taxa
tion, than under any law ever past
ed by any legislature of any state in
the whole union. It should be rend
carefully by every voter In the
state.
Briefly: It provides, that coal nnd
metal mines In the state shall pay
only on the net profit after deduct
ing all eapfnse of mtnln, treatment
etc., that is on tha difference be
tween the total coat of mining and
treatment, and the sale price. Then
"all other lands held for fature de
velopment, goes tax free, save may
be a surface tax as pa it u re land.
Tens of thousands of acre of real
land, held like a dog in the manager
way and worth from $500.00, to $2
000, per acre goes srot free. The
millions of dollars worth of rich
mining claims, also goes free. The I
Chino Copper Co's property In Grant I
coun'y (on the tax rolU for a pit
tance is worth nesrly fifty seven I
millions of dollars, as per the vulue
of its shares of stock.
If this unamerican rule is to pre
vail, then a merchant should pay no
tax on his store and stuck, und only
on his net profits.
An owner of rented houses, tthould
pay nothing on his building and lots
but only on what Is left of the rents
after deducting up-keep and insur
ance etc. The Colfax county, Me-
Kinley and other county big
coal i
companies under this Inw, escape
with humlredH (yes that Is it) of
millions of dollars worth of property
without tax. If they don't want to
pay tax on the property they have,
then let it go buck to the public do
main (the people) that la what hap
pens a poor mana house and lot, if
he does not pay his taxes on it. It is
an outrage, the way tax matters are
in New Mexico.
Camp Southard.
Upon entering the grounds at the
state fair at Albuquerque, the flrst
thing to catch the eye was the sign
"Boys' and Girls' Industrial Clubs-
Camp Southard.
There In that camp were gather
ed the county winners in Boys' and
Girls' club work to the number of
216, 'with 28 chapetones.
These boys and girls had a royal
good time, entertained at tha ramp,
with all expenses paid. Through the
generosity of 'the fair management
they were given the rivlligea of the
grounds and the grand stand free of
expense. The mornings were de
voted to lessons, talks and demon
strations, the afternoon and even.
inga to recreation.
Capt Tonlouse, who had charge of
the camp, la big hearted man, with
room In hi heart for all the boya
and girl. ,
Moving pictures were taken of the
boya and girls at work on the differ
ent projects, whieh Capt Tonlouse
proposes to show lover the state in
the Interest of club work, .
There were five projects for club
memlMtrs this past year, sewing,
cooking, pig raising, chicken raisng
and gardening and canning.
Each boy or girl who enters on
of these contests Is required to keep
a careful and accurate account of at!
labor and expense, also to writ a
story telling how the work was done.
Each one can tell exactly what it
cost him to produce the article, bird
or animal In his contest work.
The Importance of this training to
boys and girla can not be over esti
mated, and the young folks left with
the determination to do better next
