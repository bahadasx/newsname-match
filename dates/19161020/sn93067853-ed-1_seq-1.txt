Large Crowds Throng the City

Various Amusements ? One
of the Attractive Featuers

One of the biggest amusement
events of the season put on this week

the K. G. Barkoot shows, and
exhibitions are being given all this
week.
The Barkoot company now has 15
big shows, a number of new and novel
exhibitions having been added to the
aggregation since its last appearance
here. The Royal Italian band, which
made a great impression in the city
on a previous visit, has been augmented
and is claimed to be better
than before. Five free acts will be
among the features to draw crowds to
the city and to the show grounds.
The Barkoot shows were here about
two years ago. It will be remembered
that they had a clean lot of attrac
tions, and the company left a very
favorable impression in this city. Mr.
Barkoot, who personally conducts the
enterprise, made many friendj in the
city, who will welcome his return.
mmis^ftalian band that*"is ^now wffti "j
the Barkoot shows in Union undei

But there are many others; a monkey
speedway with monkeys driving miniature
autcs, the Russian dancers,
Frederick the Great, the wonderful
magician, Oriental dancing girls, Bertini,
the spiral tower actor, |\nd Monsouli,
the high wire artist are a few
of the attractions. There are 16 of
theni. The shows will be in Union
all this week, Monday to Saturday,
inclusive.

FARM LOAN BOARD
AGENT APPROVES
Elepresentative Men From Various
Sections Invited to Meet Federal
Board.
The ioint cotpmittee representing
the Columbia Clearing House association
and the Chamber of Commerce,
having in charge the application of
Columbia for one of the 12 land
hanks, met yesterday at the People's
National bank, and perfected the program
for the hearing to be held in
Columbia on Wednesday, October 25,
by the federal farm loan board.
Frank R. Wilson of the division of
information, of the federal farm loan
bureau, at Washington, was present
as an advanced representative of the
farm loan board. The program which
has been prepared was submitted to
Mr. Wilson and approved by him and
he gave the committee the benefit of
several helpful suggestions. Mr. Wilson
left last night for Jacksonville.
The hearing before the federal farm
loan board will be held at 9:.30 a. m.
next Wednesday in the federal court
room. The board wiill come here from
Raleigh, where a hearing will be held
the day before. The board will travel
in a private car. After the hearing,
an informal luncheon will be served
flt fh O J offovfAn n?-?A 4-L/v
? - wvuviouii^ anu tUCIl tuc mumbers
of the board will be taken to the
State fair grounds. Other entertainment
will be provided for the evening.
The Columbia committee has invited
a number of representative farmers
and bankers of different sections
of the State to be present and discuss
different topics. It is the desire of the
board that, as many farmers as possible
attend the hearing, and it has
been the custom at these meetings
held elsewhere for members of the
board to _psk questions informally of
farmers who are present.
One of the strongest arguments
which will be put up in favor of Columbia
is the large number of farm
loan associations which have been organized
in South Carolina. It is beheved
that this fact will have great
weight with the board, and the work
or organizing these associations is being
pushed as rapidly as posible by
Commisioner Watson.
