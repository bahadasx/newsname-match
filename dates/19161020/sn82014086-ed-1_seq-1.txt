STATE LAWS FOR PHYSICAL
AND MILITARY TRAINING
Advocated at Meeting of University of
New York.
Albany, N. Y., Oct. 19. Two new
state laws providing for physical and
military training of school children
v-fVf praised hijrhly by speakers at
the opening session of the tlfty-second
wi, oa.loii of the University of the
: i .0 ot Sew York' today. Irving
0T-iher of Yale University declared
nine he believed the laws would tend
to make the next generation stror.ger
and longer lived than the present.
"When the European war is really
over and the world seta its face
toward reconstruction," Dr. Fisher
siiid, "I anticipate that we shall see a
keener and clearer interest in life and
race conservation than ever existed
before. The gigantic experiment of
alcoholic prohibition in Itussia, with
its wonderfully good and unexpected
results, is an immediate sanitary by
product of the war. The largest by
product thus far in this country seems
to me to be the passage of the Welsh
and Hlater acts In this state providnig
for the obligatory military training of
school children.
"I am in favor of these, acts from
many points of view, but that on which
i would placei stress at present is the
point of view of the physical develop
ment of the child. This physical de
velopment In an intcsral part of our
task of preparing good soldiers. But
It is much more. We not only want
real men behind the eruns but we van
a real man and a real womrvn in every
other relation in life.

miralty officers, from Falmiouth to
London. Warnings of these areas have
been B'ven to mariners, advising them
to obtain special pilots from the ad
miralty ervloe to insure gafo naviga
tion. With these precautions to safeguard

mine which had broken from anchor
ago or ono dropped by an enemy mine
layer. i

ous deputy shorifts, waited today for
some sign from the ravine where it is
believed tho men who last night rob
bed the Atchison, Topeka and Santa
iKe express train took refugo. Prepa
rations for a biege had been made, but
it was expected that the robbers, in
the hope of liberty, would make a dash
and precipitate a fight.
Perry Norman, express messenger,
was killed by the robbers when he
showed fight. The express safe was
demolished by an overcharge of ex
plosive, so that much of its contents
was destroyed. Rumors said the ban.
dits obtained a loot of $10,000, tout
this was based on conjecture.
Six men participated in tho robbery,
flagging the train at a desolate spot
north of Bliss on the 101 ranch. Tho
robbers worked brisky, two guairding
the train crew, who had been forced
to uncouple the engine, express and

tance down the track, two others
standing sentinel on the rear car, while
the remaining two attended to the

the bandits. It wis because of this
that they were located so soon after
the robbery.
WARSHIPS WERE NOT .
ASKED TO MOVE
Official Announcement in Washington
Denies Statement in British Parlia
ment. Washington, Oct. 19. It was an
nounced officially that the complete'
information on hand now contained
no evidence that American destrovers
had been requested to move so that
the U-boat could destroy a ship with
out accident. Tho attention given that
report in the debate Tuesday in Brit
ish parliament caused surprise here
as officials attach little importance to
it one way or the other. It is pointed
out that tha destroyers were on hand
purely for humanitarian purposes and
that so long as International law was
being observed it was but on act of
courtesy for the German commander
to give notice that he intended to sink
the vessel.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, acting secre
tary of the navy in the absence of Jo
sephus Daniels, Is quoted by a news
service here as saying in a written
statement:
"It can be stated deflnltrty. that the
destroyers of the United States navy
which went to the vicinity of the
Nantucket Shoals Light vessel Sun
day, Oct. 8, in response to S. O. S.
calls, did not in any way violate their
duty of neutrality in regard to the
vessels sunk or the passengers and
crews thereof. The action of the navy
was in absolute accordance with in
ternational law and the dictates of humanity."
