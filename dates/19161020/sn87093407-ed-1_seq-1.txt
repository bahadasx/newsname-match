Underworld dance hall agents are luring young girls into the

The Star sent a young woman reporter out to learn of the
"Forty-Nine" show.
She called at the hotel named in the advertisements. The
place is not mentioned here, because it is changed from time to

"It's Mr. Ecker you want to see," the clerk told her, when she

It was Mr. Ecker—George Ecker, known to many men who
have exchanged banter and coins oyer the old American cafe bar,
