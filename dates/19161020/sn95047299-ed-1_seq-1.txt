The fall term of the Putnam Circuit
Court finished its work Wednesday
evening and adjourned, though a few
cases on the docket were continued.
Probably the most important crimi
na case of the term was that of John
Mueller, charged with the murder of
his father and mother in the Francis
precinct on August 31st last. States
Attorney Long summoned Dr. H. Ma
rion Smith, senior assistant at the
Florida Hospital for the Insane to ex
amine the plaintiff. Dr. Smith who
spent a couple days here closely ex
amining the man, made his report to
the court on Wednesday, ur. smitns
report was as follows:
To the Honorable Jas. T. Wills, Judge
of the Eighth Judicial Circuit, Put
nam County.
"Mv ilpnr Sirr
"I have baen requested by the State
Attorney, the Honorable A. V. Long,
to make an examination of John Muel
ler, the defendant in the case herein
pending, for the purpose ol ascer
iMinincr liia nrpspTit mental condition
...", ..... r. -.- ,
AfW a rlim-mip-h and careful exami
nation, I am in a position to state that
he is in a demented or insane state 01
mind- ho is lsiliorine- under a number
of poorly systematized and absurd de
lusions, much of which is that he is
the cause of the world war now being
waged in Europe; that it was neces
sary for him to murder his parents,
that it was his duty to do so; that he
ivjj nnmnpllofl .md constrained to do
sn to influence this war. He also
manifested auditory and sensory hal
lucinations, and from the character of
the delusions he displayed ana tne
physical symptoms that I find the di
agnosis of dementia precox has been
.o,i TViio i n Hisprisp. of the mind
which is characterized by a gradual
dementing course and has progressed
to thr.t point where the subject is men
f.illir ivpiicnundlilp."
After questioning Dr. Smith as to
his experience and satisfying himself
that Mueller is insane, Judge Wills de
creed the following sentence:
"It having been suggested by the
rt tv.f tVip mipstinn of the sanity
of defendant at the present time will

Court, and the .Judge of said Court

the opinion that the said John Mueller

A very strong and convincing piece

various torms ot errors, maae oy in
spectors in the counting of the votes,
by which Mr. Catts was given votes
that were cast tor tne otner candi
dates for governor is being mailed
out to the voters ot tne state. xnia
piece of literature is gotten up in
an attractive form, and proves in a
most convincing and positive manner
that Mr. Catts was never nominated
by the voters at the primary elec
tion in June, and that he enjoyed the
honor of being considered the nomi
nee, as a result of errors made by
inspectors.
Reports are coming to Democratic

points in South Florida with a grip

can literature. No statement was
made or reasons given for his new
alignment, but the report is current,
and no denial has been made, that Mr.
Parker insisted that the secret politi
cal organization that he is known to
be interested in organizing in this
state, have endorsed Mr. Hughes in
the north, and that an order had
been sent to the courts in Florida,
demanding that they also endorse Mr.
Iln-'hes, the Republican nominee, and
ordering all members to vote for the
Republican edectors in rionaa. n.
Parker is a Republican of the I enn-
iv vaia tvpe and insists uiau u.c
. ... ... L nivlarc
courts in this state muht uuey
from the National court m so lai as
it pertains to the national ticket.
The advisability of organizing sep
erate courts in this state for the col
ored citizens is reported to have been
under consideration at the nationa
headquarters for the past several
months. The constitution and by
laws of the organization in the North
ern states is the same as used by
th courts in Fb rida and permits the
c.'ored citizens tc join on the same
lv-is as the whites. it nas nui ue.-.,
.oi.sidered advhabie in this state to
oven the doors to any but whit.! citi-,ui-'
and for this reason the separate
courts will be organized for the color
ed citizens. The same constitution
.... i u i.c it w understood, will ue
used for the colored organizations, as
is now in use by the whites.
Those who are familiar with Mr.
Parker's method are inclined to the
belief that it is his intention to begin
the organization of these courts at
once, and it was this motive that
prompted him to form his alliance
with the Republicans
Presbyterian Church.

Tallahassee, Oct. 19 The Railroad
PnmmiRsinners have won two case3 of
nnnclHorshlo imnnrtailf.B to DatrOhS Of
the Florida East Coast Railway Com-
One of the cases arose irom uie ar
nrldpH tn the reeular
mileage fare, for passengers carried
over the onuge at jacKsouvinc tm
Palatka.
The other case arose out of the re
fusal of the Florida East Coast Rail
way Company to observe Rule 19, pre
scribed by the Commissioners, by
which a reduction of 10 per cent from
the regular rate for the distance haul
ed, is required of each railroad, where
freight is hauled over two lines, and
a reduction of 20 per cent from the
regular rate, where hauled over three
or more lines.
TVioco cusps were hoth decided er-
ly in 1915 by the Supreme Court of
Florida in favor of the Railroad Com
missioners, but the Railway Company
appealed to tne supreme iouri. ui me
United States. Recently these ap
peals have been dismissed, and the
judgments ot the supreme youio oi
Honda in tavor ot tne omrmssiuncia
are now effective.
TTnn T. C. M.nsev renresented tne
Commissioners in the bridge arbitra
ges case and Hon. F. M. Hudson rep
resented them in the Rule 19 case.
The bridge arbitraries case came
about in this way. Where a passen
ger bought a ticket from one station
to another, and had to travel over the
bridge' of the East toast Kaiiway at
Jacksonville or the one at Palatka, 5c
was added to the regular 3c fare, that
is, the passenger was required to pay
5c extra to the East Coast Railway
Company for traveling over the bridge
at Jacksonville and the one at Palatka.
The Commissioners ordered the Rail
way Company to cease making this
arbitrary charge, which they refused
to do, and the case has been in the
Courts ever since, with the result as
above stated. Now the passengers
will not be required to pay this extra
5c, and will pay only the regular 3c
rate.
To give some concrete illustration
of the effect of the enforcement of the
nnmrnitsiniiprs' Freight Rule 19. it
might be stated that the first class
rate heretofore Irom lauanassee to
Miami has been $1.64 per hundred
pounds the rate with the operation
of Rule 19 on the Florida East Coast
Railway will he $1.54, and for all oth
er distances and classes, the reduction
will be in proportion.

First Literary Meeting.
TV,; nftprnnnn Mrs. .T. TX. TXaiifh-
ton as chairman of the Literary de
partment of the Woman's Club, an
nounces her subject: "Position of the
old Testament" which is sub-divided
in three parts (a) As an Influence in
World Literature; (b) As a Factor in
History; (c) As an Inspiration in Art.
.Miss isaoei weicn win nave cnarge
of the subject matter and will no
doubt handle it well. A short musical
program will follow. The literary
department this term has taken up
the historical phase of the od testa
ment for its season's study and some
very interesting subjects are present
ed in the year book, which will no
doubt make this department very enjoyable.
The. Putnam Countv Democratic Ex
ecutive Committee met at the court
house at 11 o'clock Tuesday forenoon
pursuant to a call issued by Chairman
Jos. H. Haughton. Some 20 pre
cincts were represented. I wo pre
cincts have no committeeman, and six
others failed to appear or send proxy.
Chairman Haughton explained that
tVio mpptinir was palled in order that
the county committee might endorse
the regular nominees or tne democratic
party and put its stamp of disapproval
on independentism.
Judge J. C. Calhoun addressed the
meeting in a conciliatory though
straightforward talk in which he de
plored the bitterness engendered by
the primaries and tne contest wmcn
had resulted. He explained that Mr.
Knott was clearly within his rights
as a democrat in making his contest
under the law and now that his nomi
nation had been certified to the vari
ous counties as the regular democrat
ic nominee, it behooved all good dem
ocrats to accept the result and sup-
rtrt tUa tinVpt .Turlo-p Cnlhnim also
paid his respects to independents and
urged the committee to ao its uimusu
to secure the election of the regular
party nominees.
Judge Calhoun was followed oy yv.
M. Williams of Pomona and W. A.
Russell of Crescent City, who also
urged the getting together of all fac
tions under the banner of democracy.
A nanlntmn whs introduced and
unanimously passed pledging support
to all candidates of the democratic
party from President to Justice of the
Peace as endorsed by the State Demo
cratic Executive Committee. A reso
lution condemning the action ot inde-
n.nlnnfc anrl nil ripmnprnt.fi who sifTn-
IJCIlUCIIbJ Mil" m..."-. -o
ed the petitions of independents, was
also unanimously passea.
it clinnlH hp pvnlninpd that members
of this committee during the late con
test have been divided in tneir views
as to the nominee for governor, but
when the supreme test was made, the
idea was that the question was not
"Knott or Catts," but the survival of
organized democracy; that there had
been a legal contest and the high
courts had been called upon to de
cide by the only test known to the
law a recount of votes who was the
nominee of the democratic electors.
The court had decided that the nomi
nee for governor was Hon. W. V.
Knott, as also had the State Demo
cratic Executive Committee, and there
was but one thing for this committee
and the democrats of Putnam county
a oMi ilint tn snnnort. the de
clared nominee of the party W. V.
Knott whose nomination had been
certified to the various counties by the
State Board of Canvassers.
A motion was passed that members
of the committee present make a
small contribution to the State Cam
paign committee, and all present did
so. The amount subscribed was but
i- 1 v,nvp fnllnw.
A committee consisting ot w. in.
Williams, W. A. Russell, J. C. Cal
houn, S. S. Browning and L. J. Mc-
Leod was appointed to prepare an
address to the voters of the county
nnrl rln nnvthinir else proper for the
furtherance of party candidates.
Among the committeemen present
were J. H. Hauehton, Chas. Burt, J.
W. Matthews, W. R. Revels, J. W.
Chester, Max Melzer. L. J. McLeod,
r. C. Sullivan, W. M. Williams, W. F.

haps one or two others.
Surprise Shower.
One of the most delightful of par
ties given in honor of Miss Annie
Bruce the bride-elect, was that of
Thursday afternoon, when Mrs. W. A.
Walton "entertained fifty-four friends
in her lovely home on Kirkand street.
Miss Bruce' was given to understand
that the affair was to be an after
noon "Tea," but upon arriving at the
home discovered that a surprise show
o,. Via,l linon nrmno-pd hv her hostess
who had in the living room an origi
nal improvised "wishing wen ; nnea to
t.h well wishes in senti
ment and gifts from her many friends.
For the younger set, there was a oox
of original fortunes and nonsense
verses, which proved mirth provoking.
The living rooms were bowers of ferns
and palms, and the dining room was
decorated with white and green. Cof
fee was served from the dining table
with Mrs. Robert L. Earnest assist
riplipinnc rpf rpsbmpnts consist
ing of tuna salad, wafers, coffee and
hot cheese sandwiches were served by
the following ladies who assisted Mrs.
Walton: Mesdames John N. Walton,
Robert L. Earnest. S. G. Coburn, Al
bert Tromhley, E. W. Warren, and Ed.
Wattes. The young ladies assisting
in entertaining were the Misses Susie
Walton, Nora snarpe, juhu wavei
and Anne Deaderick. During the af
ternoon an informal program of music
was given by Miss Louise Boyd and
Mrs. Robert S. O'Haver. Miss
Bruce was beautifully remembered by
numerous and costly gifts. Her
charming personality nas won mr -hosts
of friends who were only too
glad to prove their appreciation of her
sterling character.
