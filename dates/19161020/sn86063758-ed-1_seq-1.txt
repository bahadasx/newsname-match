With The Herald and New* Says
>'ewbcrry Jail is Antiquated
And Unsanitary.
The Xewberry county jail presents
a more serious fire hazard than any
other jail in South Carolina in the
opinion of A. D. Oliphant, assists
secretary of the State board of charities
and corrections, who has per
sonally inspected for the board .almost
every county jail in the State and who
:has seen reports to the board on
those jails which lie has not yet visited
in person. The representative of
the board, wnich has visitorial and
advisory powers over all the penal
and charitable institutions in the State
spent Tuesdey and Wednesday in Newberry
and while here inspected the
county jail, county almshouse, and the
fhr^p rrnintv chaingsana: camps.
"I do not believe," iMr. Olliphant declared,
that there is a farmer in Newberry
county who would not think a
Very long time before he stabled his
li\estock in a place which was as
liable to catch fire as the Newberry
county jail if he would have the same
difficulty geting them out in case of
fire that the officers -would have in
nrionnorc out of the iail.
The Jail was built before the war foetwen
the Sections. Wood was used
very largely in its interior construction,
even the walls of two of the
prisoner's "cages" being built of this
material. It is threestories high, and
it is necessary to use three stoves to
that the quarters of the prisoners,
third floor tne pipes from the two
stoves in the prisoners' quarters
stretch over half th^ width of the
building to a chimney. This system of j
heating increases the .naturally large
lire hazard tremendously.*
The representative of the hoard of
charities and corrections said, too,
that the quarters of the prisoners'
built long before modern ideas of
sanitation were thought of, were bad
ly lighted, got little or no sunlight
l
-nd were poorlyj ventilated. The|
floors on the second and third floors i
are so worn and full of cracks that
they cannot be scoured as when water
is poured on them it filters through
the cracks into the sheriff's quarters
on the first floor. This has happened
ilso when one of the flush toilets in
the prisoners' quarters got stopped up
*nd flooded.
"During the period in which the |
board has finished compiling its record,
an average of 9.4 prisoners a day
were confined in the Newberry county
jail," said Mr. Olliphant. "A very!
targe majority of the prisoners in this
jail, as in every other jail in the
State, were people .who were awaiting
trial and, accordingly, were innocent
in the eyes of the law. Yet they were
forced to stay in this jail in great
danger from fire and a serious risk
to their health. Newberry county
needs and should have a new Jail as
soon as possible."
Mr. Oliphant made it plain that no
county offi-cial was responsible, nor |
should be criticized for the structual
defects in the jail which make the.(
danger from fire\in it gre?at and make
it likewise a menace to the health of
the prisoners confined in it.
Death of Jlr. L. J. Watkins.
Mr. Luther J. Watkins died at the
home of his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Wm. Q. Watkins, near Chappells, of
typhoid fever on Sunday morning, m
two o'clock, he service was conducted
by the Rev. G. R. Pettigrew. He
was twenty-seven years old. Mr.
Watkins had been living in Greenwtod
but took sick while on ^ visit to his
parents.

1 i.ave received the following com^j

"her for her kind words about myseif.
It is so seldom that one' who is trying
to do something for the general

This comes like an oasis in the midst
of a dry and barren desert. I' am:
afraid that our town is not so much'
a sleepy town -as it is a town in the
midst of a noble self satisfaction with
itself?now, I know that is not ex
actly properly stated, t>ut it expresses
two things, satisfaction and selfish- <
ness?well, I am Afraid the trouble
with us is, as I was saying, we are
too well pleased with our noble selves, i
that we do not care to have any one .;
come in and abide with us, and in be
ing in that state we make it impossible
for our young blood to remain. Now. (

says. I always feel, j

May make a heart -the lighter,

Dear 5?r: Idler:
I am sending you "a piece" to read
and to use as you may think best in
some of your booster write-ups in The
Herald and News. You have tried ^

you will yet succeed ip waking up (
"the sleepy old town.''

I'AThy not let the1 young folks have the
town and get it on a "modern boom?" 1
Let 'em try their hand, Let 'em "get
things humming on' a regular tare." J
Then if they fail to get up on time
some bright morn and things bust up. 1
then we "antiquated folks'' can pt?h
things through to a ffnfsh. All we
want is to get their ideas and a start, we
have got the push all right. I
hav#> never had "the pleasure of meet
ing you" but I have an idea you are a I'
hard" worker - and not an idler..
At any rate you Have good horse
sense of "the- olden- type" and! I like
your writings and wish you wrelL
Please be sure to publish "the piece"
I: send you for I want it printed, so
I can get a copy for my scrap book.
See! May be some of the knockers
will become boosters, rather than be
classed lower than the rattlesnake,
the hyena, the scorpion and the skunk.

"When the Creator had made all the
good and beautiful things in order1
that they might be truly appreciated,
He then made the beasts, reptiles and |
poisonous insects. fvYlhen He had finished.
He bad left over scraps that
were too bad to put in the rattlesnake,
the hyena, the scorpion or the
skunk, so He placed all these together,
covered it with suspicion, wrapped
it with jealously, marked it with a
yellow steak and called it a knocker.
Then as a compensation for this fearI
ful product He took a sunbeam and
| put in it the heart of a child, tee love
of a mother, the brain of a man, wrapped
these in civic pride, covered it
with brotherly love, give it a mask
j of velvet and a grasp of steel and called
it a booster. He made him a lover
of fields and flowers and manly sports,
a believer in equality snd justice. And
ever since the?e two were created,
mortal man has had the privilege of
choosing his associates/'

It is very kind of this good woman
to say tliat she has an idea that'
f am i hard worker and not an idler, j
Wfjii recKon some peopie wouia say
tha'C I am a hard worker, and gome
would say that I do nothing. It is a
pleasure for me to write, and as I
Have said several times, I do it for
tfhe pleasure it is to me 'and not for
lue compensation I receive, because
I do not get enough in monef out of
it, as the old saying is. to keep a jay
bird alive. But if I can say some^
thing that wii^d?: some soul good, and
start a thought in some mind that -will
be helpful, I fcave my reward. You
know, I believe very strongly, as I
have frequently said, in tlie Bible, and
that justice and right will prevail, and
also that bread cast upon: the waters
will return after maaay days. Sometimes,
it is true, it does seem that the
lays <are very many, but then we do
not get the true meaning of the sentiment
if we cast the bread with the expectation
of its return, because that
commercializes the -bread. The nat- J
iral offspring of commercialism is I
iclfishness. That causes the people
to forget the general welfare1 and to
think only of themselves. 'And of the
money they may accumulate. You may
remember what the old poet;. Goldsmith
oatfi nf n land in his 'beau
Lifal little poem on the Deserted Village:
111 fires the land, to hast'ning ills a
VTCJ,
Where wealth accumulates, and-men
decay;
Prinees and lords may flourish, or may
fnjria 1
A .breath can make them, as a
breath has made;
But a bold peasantry, their country's
pride,
When once destroyed, can never, be
sunDlied."
I do not mean that this is a deserted
village, but we need to hie 'back
;o a little less selfishness and a little
nore concern for our village and the
general welfare. The great need of
.his community as I see it is for more
rooperation .and more public spirit and
nore get-to-gether for the general
jood. The spirit that I am talking
jrbout is expressed in the following
ittle poem:
MY TOWN!

And I "want to do ray part

And I want my town to grow;
If I knocked my town or I blocked my

That wouldn't be nice, you Know:
I think my town is the very best town
In all the world?to me!
Or if it's not, I want to get out
And try to make it be.
I talk my town and I preich my town,
As I think a fellow should
Who has more at stake than to win

For the love of the common good!
I bet on my town, and I bank on my

And I think it fine to feel? i
When you know your town and you

That it's part of your honest zeal!
I'm proud of my town, .1 love my

And that's the way to help a town?i
Not curse it and despise!
