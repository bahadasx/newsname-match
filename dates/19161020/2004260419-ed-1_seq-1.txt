BIG BARN AND
HAY ON FIRE
The big barn on the Dan Freeman
place, near Scappoose, which is leased
by Frank L. Smith of Portland,
caught fire Wednesday afternoon and
the fire, which originated in the 200
tons of hay stored therein, was not
put out until Thursday afternoon.
The St. Helens fire department was
called on, and Fire Chief Watkins
took up the chemical engine. The
Portland fire department was also
asked for aid and they sent down an
engine, but on arriving at the scene
it was found that there was not suf
ficient hose to reach to the nearby
slough. St. Helens was again called
on and sent up some 400 feet of hose
which aided materially in the fight
against the fire. The barn, which is
a very large structure. Is not dam
aged to a great extent, but more than
100 tons of hay has been burned.

The registered republicans are 2 V&
times as many as the entire registra
tion of other parties, and ns com
pared with the democrats Is about
3H to 1. Ordinarily tho vote Is not
as heavy as the registration, but
Columbia county should poll at least
3,500 votes.

DEMOCRATS HOLD
WILSON RALLY
PRESIDENT EULOGIZED
Mark Weather ford and ettlie
Humphrey AddreHM Meeting.
Mark Weatherford, democratic
nominee for congress, and Leslie
Humphrey, a law partner of Senator
Chamberlain, wore the principal
speakers at the democratic rally at
the city hall Tuesday night. An
audience of about 150 people heard
the orators, who were introduced by
W. li. Dillard, president of the local
Wilson league.
Mr. Weatherford impressed those
who heard him with Ills sincerity,
hut his speech was not attractive
from either a logical or oratorical
standpoint. He praised the stand
taken by President Wilson in his for
eign end Mexican policies and also
his efforts towards maintaining peace.
Mr. Weatherford said if ho was
elected ho would support the presi
dent In his peace policies. He also
paid a compliment to former Presi
dent Taft on his decsiion to leave the
Maxlcms alone and also leaving as
l legacy to Wilson tho Mexican prob
lem. Mr. Weatherford said, "The
president has done all that words can
do."
Mr. Humphrey, who followed the
congressional candidate, eulogized
the president in the policies of the
democratic administration.
As orators or logical speakers, both
gentlemen were a disappointment to
those who heard their talks, and the
only real speech of the evening was
made by W. B. Dillrrd. If Weather
ford came to St. Helens in the hopes
of making any votes for himself he
will be disappointed, for he simply
tried to ride through on the policies
of President Wilson.
AUTOMOBILISTS HAVE
A NARROW ESCAPE
Early Sunday morning the auto
mobile driven by Dr. J. L. Zipperer,
In attempting to pass the machine
driven by Edgar Muckle, struck the
latter and Muckle's car swerved from
the road and took a plunge ever the
narrow fill Just a few hundred yards
north of the I. O. O. F. cemetery near
Warren. All of the occupants of
Muckle's car luckily escaped serious
Injury except Alfred George, who
was thrown from the car and ren
dered unconscious. He also suffered
painful bruises end his face was
badly disfigured.
The wrecked car, which belongs to
U. S. DeSpain. was taken to Portland
Wednesday and is now In the repair
shop. The six occupants of the car
ate congratulating themselves that
they received no worse Injuries than
a Bevere shaking up. Dr. Zlpperer's
car was uninjured.
ST. HELENS-HOULTON
ROAD BEING IMPROVED
The county court has a force of
men at work on tho St. Helens-Houl-ton
road. They are experimenting
with the "Richmondite" road surface
material. Tho ninny rough Bpots and
holes between the Central Grocery
and the DeSpain hill have boon fixed
and the hill has been treated to an
application of the fine rock nnd "hot
stuff." If this material Btands the
heavy traffic which passes over this
thoroughfare it will be abundant
proof that it is a good article for
road building and repairing.
TAX COLLECTIONS
COME IN RAPIDLY
From September 14 to October 18
Sheriff Stan wood has collected and
turned ovor to County Treasurer
Hunt more than $150,000 in taxes.
Tho tax roll of the county is approxi
mately $427,000, and Sheriff Stan
wood states that not more than $50,
000 will be delinquent on the entire
roil. This is a very good showing,
and the sheriff is to be congratulated
on the collection of so largo an
amount. For the next several months
tho tcxes will come in slowly, and In
all probability not more than $30,000
will- be delinquent by the first of
tho year.
NO. 44
BIG LUMBER DEAL
NOW UNDER WAY
MAY BUILD BIG MILL
t'tuli People Take Option on Colum
bia County Timber.
The people of St. Helens and Col
umbia county will be interested to
know that negotiations are under
way for the purchase of the vast
timber holdings of the DuBols com
pany by the Oregon Lumber Com
pany, a Utah corporation. That
negotiations are under way is
admitted by John E. DuBois, who is
now in Portland. The timber is lo
cated In the Nehalcm country and is
more than a billion feet. Mr. DuBols
was in St. Helens several days ago,
but whether his presence here had
any significance so far as the sale
goes could not be learned. The tim
ber is located along the Neholem
river and Rock creek, and is one of
the finest bodies of standing timber
in Columbia county. Should the Utah
people buy this it will require an out
lay of about $1,500,000 for the tim
ber alone. Some time ago DuBois
held this same body of timber for
$2,000,000.
Should the deal be consummated,
the purchasers would have to build
about 20 miles of railroad to get the
log:-, to a point on the Columbia river,
and the closest points are St. Helens
and Columbia City.
For some time it haa been predict
ed that DuBois would build a large
mill at the latter place, as his com
pany owns valuable waterfrontage
there, and it might be that the pur
chase of the timber means the estab
lishment of another sawmill. An
other way the timber could come out
would be by making an extension of
the St. Helens Lumber Company's
logging railroad to Rock creek, a
distance of approximately 15 miles.
There is one thing certain, if the
Eccles people want the timber they
have plenty of resources behind them
to get it, to build a railroad and a
mill. They have been operating in
the eastern Oregon country and in
addition to owning several large saw
mills and much timber, own the
Sumpter Valley railroad. Should
the pending deal go through, it will
rank as the largest deal made in sev
eral years and will add much to the
prosperity of the city and county.
ST. HELENS BOY WINS
HONORS AT O. A. C.
Dale Perry, son of Mr. and Mrs.
G. W. Perry, who is a graduate of
the St. Helens high school, is win
ning honors at the Oregon Agricultu
ral College. He is at the head of
his class in stock raising and has
been appointed sergeant at arms of
tho student body, quite d signal hon
or. As yet. Dale has not been hazed,
and the story is that when a big
sophomore chased him, that Dale
turned on the upper classman, took
his class pin away from him and in
vited him to "beat It." Dale is play
ing on the football team of tho fresh
man class and in all probability will
be given a tryout on the regular
Varsity team.
