NUMBER 1

HTC
WILSON OR HUGHES.
Who Will be Next President-Side Lights end Prophecies.
The following is taken from a Colum
bus, Ohio, paper, and is decidedly Re
publican in its editorial utterances.
Coming from puch a source it would
eeem that Mr. Wilson's chances to win
are good.
As a result of straw votes by
some of the dailies of the coun
try, clairris by leaders of both of
the great political parties and
the uncertainty of where the
Progressive vote of four years
Ego is going, there is much
speculation as to the outcome of
the presidential ection of 1916.
Both Democrats ani Republi
cans are asking the question:
"What is the matter with the
campaign?
The answers offered are far
apart- The Democrats are of
the opinion that the lack of pub
lic interest in the energies of the
professionals to excite the public
mind over the issues offered by
the Republican candidate is due
tc the satisfaction of the voters
with the Democratic record and
pledges for the future.
The Republican view is that
"the people have made up their
minds." and that the result
favorable to the Republicans of
course "is a foregone conclu
sion." The Democrats agree
with this in so far as it appears
to the state of the public mind,
but take the entirely opposite
view of the effect -and the con
clusions. Do Your Own Figuring
In the 48 states of the union
there are 531 votes in the elec
toral college a majority of
these, or 266, is necessary to a
choice.
The concessions of each side
are worth considering because
they eliminate from final calcu
lations and conclusions states
that can be credited safely to
one party or the other. The
more candid of the Bepublican
loaders afr compelled to' concede
that President Wilson will carry
the following states:
Elfftorul

Alabama 12
Arizona 3

New Mexico 3
North Carolina 12
Oklahoma in
South Carolina 0
Tennessee 12
Texas 2d
Virginia 12
Total 107
More Interssting Data
The Democrats while hoping
that the results in some of th?
following states may be other
wise, are forced by the results
cf their own investigations to
concede the following states to
the Republicans:
Electoral
States Vote
Connecticut 7
Idaho 4
Iowa.' 13
Illinois 2'J
Kansas.. . . 10
Maine C
Massachusetts 18
Michigan l!i
Minnesota 12
New Hampshire 4
North Dakota F
Oregon 5
Pennsylvania 38
Rhode Island 5
South Dakota 5
Utah 4
Vermont 4
Wisconsin 13
Washington 7
Total 204
Granting the above tables it
will be noted that Wilson needs
69 more electoral votes to wiri
and that Hughes, the Republi
can candidate, must get 62 mort
electoral votes.
The states that both sides are
compelled to admit as doubtful,
are:
New York 4"
Irdiana ; 1."
C-iio.r ; 2-i
California 13
Nebraska b
Wyoming 2
Njw Jersey 14
Vett Virginia . 8
Total... 130
Now comes the problem of tht
political forecasters. Wilson car
win by carrying New York and
Ohio, or by carrying Ohio, JrnJi-
ana, Nebraska, New Jersey and
West Virginia both combina
tion s giving the necessary total
of 69.
On the other hind Hughes can
win by carrying New York and
Ohio, criving all the rest of the
doubtful states to his opponent.
There are, of course, other com
binations, made up of otnors of
the doubtful states to his oppon
ent. There are. of course, other
combinations made up of others
of the doubtful spates, by which
either of the candidates may win.
but there is no rpestion that the
successful candidate must carrv
York and Ohio in any event. It
is therefore on these-two st.fes
that both parties will center
their fire.
As They Look Over Field
The first survey of th country
by the managers of both parties
shows that the Progressive vote
is of the greatest importance to
both, though the Republicans
need a vastly larevr percentage
of it than do the Democrats. In
the contest four vears ago the
combined vote of Roosevelt and
Taft exceeded that of Mr. Wil
son by 1.311.4 11. Mr. Wilson's
vote was 6.293.019. Taffc's tt.48-1,-956,
and Roosevelt 4.119,507.
In addition to these there were
cast 1,139,050 ballots, divided
between Debs (Socialist), 901.
873;Chafin (Prohibition), 207.
928. and Peimer (Social Labor),
29,259. It is conceded bv the
Republicans that Mr, Wilson
stands a good -chance of securing
a small percentage of the Pro
gressive vote, ranging from 10
to 30.
It is also manifest from the
present attitude of the Socialist'
voters that he will get probably
50 per cent cf the vote given to
Debs in 1912. Or. the basis of
minimum Prrreo.'ve esrf-'
mate of the Republicans. Mr.
Wilson would secure approxi
mately 400,000 of the vote polled
by Mr. Roosevelt.
If he secures 50 per cent of the
Socialist vote "he will inherit
probably 450.000 from that
quarter. The two combined an
nrnximnte a total of 850,000 to
offset the majority made up of
the Taft-Roosevelt vote.
If Wilson should secure 20 per
cent . of the Dull Moose vote in
the doubtful state?, he would
carry thera all with the sole ex
ception of New York.
There is also a fighting chance
for Wilson in some of the New
England States where pro-ally
sympathies are strong and muni
tion factories prosperous. New
York, however, gave Taft 3rd
Roosevelt together 190.000 more
votes than Wilson in 1912. Wil
son must carry New York this
vear, or as an alternative, do
the more surprising thing: sweep
New England.
It would seem that this age of
war has extended to famiiies in
the present political campaign.
Brother opnoses brother and
all kinds of defections are made
manifest. The Pinchots are di
vided, so are the Garfields, one
side of their illustrious houses
advocating Hughes, the other,
Wilson. The unique character
of the quest'oas with which Wil
son dealt has divided the coun
cils of his advocates and de
votees;' the undefinc-d make-up
of Hughes is causing apostasies
from the principles he espouses.
Wilson is a problem of the past.
Hughes is a question of the fu
ture. One is history, the other
promise. Considering the actual
errors of the one and the possi
ble blunders of the other, it is
hard to c include a choice.
Three-fourths of the popular novels
of the day enfeeble the intellect, im
poverish the imagination, vulgarize
tha taste and stylo,. give false or dis
torted views of life and human na
ture, and, worst of all, waste that tre-
ciwjs time which should be given to
solid mental improvement. Greyson

The Fisht Is On
I (PuWi.-hixi by Iaxjuestl
On Monday morning the Su
premo court rendered its decision
in the oa-so appealed from the de
cision of Chancellor (). 1. Taylor
of Jackson as to the referendum
amendment to the constitution.
This decision of the Supreme
judges, J ud -re Sykes dissenting,
was to the ertVet that the amend
ment did receive a majority vote
and is by subsequent act of the
legislature now a part of the con
stitution of the state. According
to this the laws against whiskey
ami whiskey advertising passed
by the last legislature may be
voted upon the first Tuesday in
November as per petition of the
six thousand who bowed the knee
to the whiskey flask.
Now, V.rethren T.eloved, we
should like .to write the rest of
Uiis in "large letters'' of the true
Pauline type. It behooves every
man among us to go to the polls
at any cost and get everybody
else to go and vottf the ticket that
will give the finishing blow to the
whiskey business in Mississippi.
The judges have done what they
conceived to be their duty and
we have no fight to make with
them. The legislators have du.ie
what they believed to be their
duty, and in the two anti
whiskey bills have given us the
best legislation that Mississippi
has ever had sii.ee we have had
statutory prohibition. That it
has done more than any other
law to destroy blind tigers is too
evident for argument. It can be
seen in any community. There
are fewer indictments, fewer sen
tences and less drunkenness than
ever before. A quart of whiskey
cannot be divided among many or
last long. Those who get it are
very economical with it. The
anti-advertising law removes the
temptation and the opportunity
from most who would order it.
There is no question as to the
value of t!ic law in the minds of
xor.t
rle. "v-0 onno!'-
tion to It is one of the best testi
monials to its value. The Objec
tion to the law is on the part of
people who drink to their hurt,
and now they can't get what they
want.
The readers of The Record need
no argument to show the worth of
the law. The majority of the
voters in Mississippi are out and
out in favor of it. The only dan
ger lies in the possibility of fail
ure of many of them to vote.
Time was never a time when the
duty to vote was moie imperative
than in tliis issue. The whiskey
houses and whiskey agents and
whiskey lovers will spare no
money nor effort to get every
blossomed son of Uaechus to the
polls. Let the sons of light be
equal to the emergency. This is
the time for preachers to speak
the truth buldiy. It is vastly of
more consequence to every man in
Mississippi how this question
goes at the polls, than whether
Hughes or Wilson is elected presi
dent of the United States. The
time is short and the issue is now
upon us. The fight is on. liap

Death! O cruel foe of mortal man,
Ever dost thou seek to mar his plan!
Many the ways and means are thine;
Of all the wor.it is darning wine.
Nations at strife in cruel war
Do not desire strong drink any more;
Rulers and leaders all admit
Intoxicants rob men of grit.
Now is the time to help a la-other;
jve.p down the curse; the craving
smother! Anon.

Cow Testing and Dairy Profits
During the last four or fivo
years, a constantly increasing
number of dairy farmers have
been testing their cows and
weeding out the "boarders."
Probably five times as many
dairy cows are being tested to
day as five years ago. Never
theless, nine-tenths of the dairy
cows of the country have never
been tested.
On the whole dairying has had
much more intelligent attention
directed toward it than either
steer feeding or hog raising. A
few dairymen have been wak
ened up to a sense of realization
of the value of scientific methods.
Hog and cattle feeders are also
adopting scientific methods, but
scientific methods as applied to
hog and cattle feeding do not
bring near the results that they
do when applied to dairy man
agement. A dairyman, by care
ful selection of animals and good
feeding may double his produc
tion per cow, but neither the
h'ig nor tin1 cattle man ba3 much
hope "f doublirg the average
daily rate of gain on his animals,
