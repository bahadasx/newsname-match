DEPLORES LOSS OF OZARK
TRAIL-LONG AUTO JOURNEY
"The poople of Chickasha do not
know what they .missed when they lost
the Ozark trail," declared Dr. E. L.
Dawson, who has just returned from
an interesting automobile trip to
Carlsbad, N. M.
"Whenever you reach a state road
you recognize it immediately by the
stream of automobiles which look
like ants in the distance. There is no
town reached by one of these state
roads that is not benefited. Cars are
constantly going back and forth and
are1 never out of sight a perpetual line
of revenue producers. The travelers
always buy something at every point
which they pass through, sometimes
it is gasoline, at other times a pair of
stockings or a handkerchief and fre
quently a meal for which they pay lib
erally. .
"It is exceedingly unfortunate for
any town to be sidetracked by one of
these highways and when it is too late
the town so sidetracked will see its
mistake and Will lament it.

Dallas, Tex,, Oct. 20. The weather
bureau reports killing frosts in north

lone, tender vegetation in central Tex

Antonio 42, Galveston 4l, Corpus
Christ! 50.
Cotton Not Damaged.
That lust night's frost would not ma
terially damage the local cotton crop
is the opinion of cotton dealers. While
the frost will damage those bolls
which have not matured it will at the
same time help to develop and open
tolls which were still clotted, making
a holly crop. Whatever damage might
result from laBt night's frost, which is
the frost usually expected at this date,
to the little cotton which might oth
erwise have matured, will be more
than offset by gains due to the rains
in September.

and value to Its members the openii
session of the Grady County Teache j
association which convened at t!

was a decided success. Never in US
annals of the association has su-
i
absorbing interest in both addrestui
and proceedings been manifested '.u
the officers are already highly grat;
tied at the success of the 1916 meet. I
President J. VV, Morgan presided ;

education in Grady county from j
standpoint of future, the program w;
carried out as officially announce
A number of visitors attended bot
afternoon and evening session, esp
cially the latter, where their present
was marked.
President Morgan's Address.
The convention was opened by Pre ,
ident J. W. Morgan who, in his addret '
to the teachers, brougnt out the fo,
lowing points in speaking of : th
things that tend to the betterment '
the schools: , I
"We need better sanitation. I
"We need better qualified teacher
"We need more ' practical teacUn;
' "Wo need better supervision. t
'We need less legislation of an e;!
perimental kind. f
"We need belter rural conditions. '
"We need to know the value of en
ucation. . ' ' f
"We need more professional 'court'
Speaking of sanitation he emphf
sized the fact that there were fev
schools in the county that had prope!;
ventilation a:.9 heat. Better qualified
teachers did not Imply that the teacl
ersers now In service had not the up
essary education but that added t,j
this must be tact and to be fully qual '
fied the teacher must be a leader i
children's exercises.
The only solution to the problem oj
more practical teaching is tb '
Innate or acquired desire of the teacl '
er to advance, to push up. In order t
become effective in their work teacl ;
ers must leave the . beaten path an ;
ascend to higher fields of endeavor, j
In the interest of tetter supervision
the!' superintendent should not hav
office work to perform but shoul
spend his full time in the field, leav
ing his clerical duties to he performed
by his assistant.
In order to improve rural coudtioiu '
the small schools should be bette ;
equipped and better accommodation;
afforded teachers.
More professional courtesy is need ;
ed, declared Mr. Morgan. Teacher
should not stoop to giving way to pevj
ty personal feelings or supposed grievj
ances neither should thy seek to di
predate the . work done by their i c
laborers. He deprecated a tendencv
t wage cutting which is sometiint
d n he
-i "
of a higher paid teacher by offering t '
work for less money. "It the job i
worth more money and you can fcoL'
it you are worth the money that ii of ,
fered for it. If you are not you an
incapable of holding it and should s!
a job which better fits you. 'o-'
should consider yourself as competor, :
as the other fellow," he said. f
Mr. Morgan spoke cf the value o
education and among other proofs tha :
this was not fictitious quoted the pro ,
jeedure which is followeu in ttie caw
of law suits to determine t&e value o
the man who had been killed or ha :
died from other causes. This
wa
th
based on his earning capacity,
