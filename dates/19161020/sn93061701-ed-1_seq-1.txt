was directed against Tefft, who was
net mentioned specifically in the af
fidavit, but Davisson knows and so
does everybody in the Pecos valley
know that Tefft is the authorized
agent of Contractor Dickey.
The question is, if County Treas
urer Davisson of Chaves county
wants $35,968.14 as pay for "ser
vices" in putting through a contract
for public work for some little drain
age aisiricis wnere mere was oniy

SOLD WHILE COUNTY .state land commissioner.
Davisson puts such immodest prices
in his "services," judging from the
suit against Tefft, that he might be
too expensive a man for the state.
Davisson has the reputation of be
ing a spender; he is known as one
of the gay dogs of Roswell. YVitli-

LAND COMMISSIONER
Roswell, N. M., Oct Many resi
dents of the Pecos Valley are won
dering if G. A. Davisson, of ilos-
well, democratic candidate for state
land commissioner, would expect to
collect form the state in addition
to his salary, commissions for the
sale or lease of state lands in the
event fhanoily remote) that he is
elected. Or if he would expect com
missions to himself from the pur
chasers or leases of state lands to
reimburse him for handling such pur
chasers or leases through the state
office in his charge.
This speculation among the people
is prompted by the story of Davis
son's efforts while counr.v treasurer
of Chaves county, to collect a com
mission for alleged services in sell
ing the bond issue of local drainage
districts, first from the drainage dis
trict commissioners and then from
the agent of the Kansas City con
tractor who took the bonds in con
sideration for his getting the con
tract to install the drainage plants
Davisson is still county treasurer
and is acting treasurer of the drain
age districts.
Davisson made efforts to sell the
$750,000 bond issue of the Dexter
Greenfield, Hagerman and Roswell
drainage districts, all situated in
Chaves county. He made some trips
to Kansas City and Chicago in ef
forts to sell the bonds.
Walter S. Dickey, the Kansas City
contractor who got the contract for
installing the drainage plants, bid 90
cents for the bonds. His only bid
and the drainage commissioners ac
cepted it. Now, the law stipulates
that the drainage districts cannot
pay commissions for the sale of

women eke out an existence as post
