Miss Vina Mousseau,
Island Pond, Vt.
An event of great interest and
importance to the Holstein-Friesian
breeding industry took place Sept.
14, when the Fred F. Field Holstein
company of Brockton, Mass., pur
chased of Mrs. Franc A. Smith of
Brainardhurst, Alexander, N. Y.,
the 4-year-old bull, King Segis Pon
tiac Konigen 97988, paying $35,000
therefor.
The price paid $35,000 seems a
large sum, but these figures are de
clared absolutely bona fide by the
parties concerned in the transaction.
Mrs. Smith considers the bull a peer
less animal and sells him to give him
the opportunity demanded by his
great breeding;and Mr. Field bought
him to breed to the daughters of
Dutchland Creamelle Korndyke Lad,
whom he considers quite as good a
bull as the one just purchased. He
believes that by bringing together
these two great families he is uniting
the greatest producing families of
the breed, for both milk and butter,
in the early and short time tests.
In his breeding of Holstein cattle,
Mr. Field has ajways advocated in
dividuality, with fine types of udder,
great depth of body, and large flow
or milk, with as high fat per cent as
possible under normal conditions, as
typical of the Holstein cow. He
disapproves of high records made
through scientific manipulation un
der abnormal conditions. He is
believer in line breeding but not in
inbreeding.
