SAVE MONEY FOR THE CITY
Municipal Rock Crushing Plant will
Soon be Up and in Active
Operation
The action of the city council at its
regular meet Tuesday in accepting the
report of the street committee which
recommended the installing of a rock
crushing plant on the city's property
adjacent to the public park plat in the
first ward will mean the saving of
many dollars on street work in the
future.
For some time the city has been
purchasing lime rock from the quar
ries near -town and having it shipped
in by , rail. This has. been costing ap
proximately 60 cents per ton f. o. b.
Ocala. Chairman Mclver of the street
committee estimates that with the
new plant this rock can be delivered
on the street -department's carts at
ess than half of the former cost.
The crushing plant and quarry have
a capacity considerably greater "than
will be .needed for present uses, tho
with the street improvements the
council has in contemplation it will
facilitate matters a great deal in that
there will always be available suffi
cient rock to keep the regular force at
work. The city has been using an
average of three carloads a week, and
the saving on the new plan will with
in a yearand a half pay the cost of
installation besides putting the street
committee in a position to do its work
in a more economical manner than by
the old method of hand loading carts
and long hauls.
It is thought that 1 the new plant
will be in operation by January first.

Likely that Lots will be Doing on that
Occasion in the Amuse-
. ment Line . -
- Mr, Irving J. Polack. creneral man
ager of the Rutherford Greater Shows,
which will furnish ; the joyland of
amusement features for our - comine
fair, spent yesterday in conf erence
with the management of the fair, and
met the executive committee at 7 :30
p. m., at which time he made many
suggestions that will greatly add to
the interest and success of this our
ninth annual . fair which bids fair to
be the largest and best that we have
eyer held.
Mr. Polack is interested in his work
and in the success of the fairs with
which he co-operates, far beyond the
interest taken by the ordinary show
manager. He says he is bringing us
eighteen shows, including - the new
$10,000 Whip. :. ; . : '
The progress of Chase City, . Va
where the show played before going
to Eastman, Ga., where they are now
located, says of the Rutherford shows:
"The carnival shows are among the
largest and best on the road and have
0 ..
been given liberal patronage since the
opening of the fair on Tuesday morn
ing. There are fifteen shows on the
fair grounds including the latest and
greatest of all amusement devices,
the $10,000 'Whip and to the credit
of the local fair association it may be
said that Chase City is the first place
in the state of Virginia to exhibit this
wonderful device. Other attractions
are the motordrome, the merry-go-
round, the Ferris wheel and all the
other amusements usually offered at
fairs.
The preliminary hearing of Lloyd
Rivers, charged with killing Norman
Brooks, was held before Judge Smith
this "morning. Rivers was held to

you are almost certain to feel all
right within a day or two. Despond

Jacksonville, Oct. 20. -Reports are
coming to democratic headquarters of
the organization of democratic clubs
in a large number of v-ountles, re
questing literature,- and assuring the
camDaiErn committAA tka

until election they will actively work
for the election of every one of the
democratic nominees. Numerous re
quests are coming to the committee to
supply speakers for democratic ral
lies. These letters indicate a rarsidly
changing sentiment, and that the op
ponents of the democratic nominee are
losing support heretofore actively
working in behalf of other candidates.
From Bradford county comes the re
port that some of the Catt Clubs, or
rather the secret societies supporting
Mr. Catts in that county, have en
dorsed and instructed the members to
vote for Mr. Coffin, the Prohibition
Candidate for Congress against Hon
orable Frank Clark. It is also report
ed that some of these clubs have en
dorsed the republican electors.
It isc also reported that some of
those. f!atfa PlnKa in TiraAfnrA
have endorsed the Republican Electors
and also the Republican candidate for
justice of the supreme court against
Hon. R. Fenwick Taylor, Democratic
nominee.
The Democrats of Putnam county
have organized and have begun an ac
tive campaign for the nominees, and
say that Putman will give a big ma
jority for the ticket next month.
Honorable W. T. Cowles spoke to
a very large and enthusiastic audi
ence at Palatka, preceding the meet
ing of the county democratic commit
tee. At the meeting of the county
democratic committee a resolution was
passed endorsing air the Democratic
nominees, and especially urging the
Democrats of' that county to the sup
port of Hon. W. V. Knott the party
nominee for governor. A resolution
was also passed condemning all Inde
pendents in the state and county, and
expressing unanimous conviction that
no Democrat could-consistently sign
the petition of any man whose design
was to become a candidate to oppose
the "Democratic ticket.
There are 28 members of the Coun
ty Democratic Committee in Putman
county, and a large number of these
members have heretofore been ardent
supporters of Mr. Catts, and the re
markable feature of this meeting was
that every member of the committee
unanimously endorsed all the nomi
inees and openly pledged their sup
port in the coming election.
This assures for Putnam county a
united Democracy and a systematic
and energetic fight for the election of
every nominee on the ticket. ' . -
The campaign literature distributed
by the county committee in Putnam
county has been the means of convinc
ing a large number of people who
have heretofore been supporters of "
Mr. Catts, under the impression that

Catts was not entitled to the support
of the Democrats of this state, and
that he enjoyed the distinction of be

In the wake of Mr. Catts' speaking
itinery reports are coming in of false
statements made by the Independent
candidate the most misleading being
that the Supreme Court was biased
and if the Court should have ordered
the 69 votes in Alachua county count
ed that Mr. Catts would have been
the nominee. This statement is made
in the face of the signed statement in
the form of a telegram to Hon. Georga
P. Rainey, chairman State Democrat
ic Committee, that on October 10 there
were 66 uncounted votes for Mr. Catts
and 88 for Mr. Knott, which if re
counted would have increased Mr.
Knott's lead to 41 votes. Mr. Catts
was given full credit for the 69 votes
in the tabulation made by the secre
