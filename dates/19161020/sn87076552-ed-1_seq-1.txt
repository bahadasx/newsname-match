COUNCIL MEETING

clerk was instructed to advertise for
bids on such apparatus.
The council went into executive
I session and press representatives and
! visitors were excused by the Mayor.
The council lacked one of having a
fun attendance last' Monday evening,
but tne meeting went on record as one
without a dull minute. Routine busi
ness was cleared away in short order
una report oi committee appointed on
the Cedar street proposition was call
ed for. Councilman Howe responued
witn the information that the Spring
er property at the south end of this
street which it will be necessary to
purchase or condemn in order to widen
this street, could be purchased for
$:U)0. Lhscussion as to methods of
complying with the petition of pro
perty owners to widen the street
brought up the propositions that
other property would have to be pur
chased ll the Springer property was
purchased as the otter of owners to
donate ground was made on the con
dition that all other owners of ground
necessary for the city to acquire in
order to widen the street should do
nate such ground, also that the money
to purchase such grounds could not be
raised by subscriptions from Cedar
street property owners. Councilman
Hulger seemed inclined to think that
the Cedar street matter was in some
measure a case of "soiled laundry"
brought to the council to be washed.
Messers II. A. Lee and M. Dangler
were present and were called upon to
express themselves. Mr. Bulger pre
sented a plan which would make a
forty foot street clear through. Mr.
Lee insisted on a 60 foot street and
all buildings that were over the. street
line when such street should be es
tablished, be moved back. Mr. Dang
ler insisted that he had built his Ce
dar street house within the boundaries
given him by a surveyor whom he had
employed to measure his lot and that
his sidewalk was laid on the line and
grade given him by the city surveyor
under the direction of the council. Mr.
Lee when questioned as to whether
the property owners on Cedar street
would be willing to pay the purchase
price of grounds that must be pur
chased in order to improve the street,
answered that they would pay when
it was assessed with their taxes.
Later the council in discussing the
matter further came up against a
blank wall when they discovered that
there was no money available with
which they could go on with this im
provement and that there was no like
lihood of there being any such money
for some time, to come; the Cedar
strfft improvement was promptly
tabled.
" The clerk was ordered to notify pro
perty owners on the East side of
Franklin street to construct sidewalk
on the West side of that street and
South of Birch street.
New specifications for combination
auto truck for the fire department
were approved by the council and the

next Sunday. He will speak at 11:00
o'clock at the Congregational church
on the work of the American Board in
Turkey. At 7:00 o'clock, Mr. Ryan
will give his lecture on "Dark Days
in Turkey." Familiarity with the
Armenian atrocities, personal know
ledge of Turkish secret service .work,
and expulsion from the city because of
help rendered to Armenians give Mr.
Ryan's lecture interest and appeal.
Mr. Ryan is the first man returned
from the war front, to visit Wauseon.
And because of his official position in
Turkey, can give us vivid and accur
ate picture of war conditibns. The
public is invited. A silver offering
will be received to be given Mr. Ryan
to help Armenian refugees for whom
he has assumed personal responsibili
ty. AUTO COLISION.
Last Sunday evening a large crowd
gathered on Fulton street in front of
the First National Bank buliding in
an incredibly short space of time the
occasion was the colision of the autos
owned and driven by Messrs. J. R.
Ruihley and Thos. Miley. Hard to
tell how the accident occurred, but
it seems that neither driver saw the
other and the consequence was a coli
sion which resulted in. bending the
front axle of Mr. Miley's auto no one
hurt.

REPUBLICAN COUNTY CAMPAIGN
The W. C. T. U. will meet at the
library next Wednesday afternoon at
2 o'clock. All members are urged to
be present.
Interesting but not pleasant, to
the persons victimized, especially in
these days of rapidly advancing prices
are the burglaries which have occur
red in Fulton county during the past
week; within five days three build
ings nave been entered and property
taken therefrom. The program began
last Friday night when the general
store of Rychener Brothers at Pettis
ville was entered and 12 pairs of shoes
20 pounds of butter, 10 pounds of
coffee, 5 pounds of bacon, 1500 cigars,
a calabash pipe and 11 neckties were
taken therefrom. The burglars car
ried off their loot in an auto which on
account of odd tires on the various
wheels enabled the officers to track
them east toward Toledo until a well
travelled stone road with a hard sur
face made further trailing impossible.
This suggests that the "auto-burglars
association," which seems to have
headquarters in Toledo might contri
bute the "good roads" movement in
this section by insisting on a hard
surface being specified for inter-county
highways and main market roads,
they might even contribute a little
money toward paying for roads so
constructed which they use in their
business.
The second number in the series was
staged in Wauseon and the indications
are that there was but a single per
former. The drug store of Fink &
Haumesser was entered some time
Saturday night or early Sunday morn
ing and about $25.00 worth of narco
tics taken, evidences show that the
party came for the purpose of getting
a supply of "dope" and knew just
where in the store to look for it. This
party also seemed to think he could
"do better in Toledo" and left Wau
seon for thaj city early Sunday morning.
The third and last number in the
series up to date took place at Del
ta Tuesday night when the Delta
branch of the Rural Egg Company
was entered and four cases of nice
fresh eggs each individual egg nice
ly stamped with a little rubber stamp
impression were taken hy the burg
lars, probably by auto to Toledo to
"do better."
The series has been one sided so far
but the officers will have their innings
later on and possibly they will run
up a score that will take the pennant
in this country at least.
CHICKEN SUPPER,
The ladies of St. Caspar's Catholic
church will serve their annual chicken
supper in the City Hall on Thursday
evening, October 26th from 5 to 8.
Everybody welcome. Those wishing
basket suppers please bring baskets
and dishes.
Township Meetings Well Attended Much Enthusiasm
Over the County Governor Willis, Senator Hale
of Maine and Congressman Nic. Longworth
of Ohio in Wauseon Next Week
The present week has been a busy
one for the Republican Executive
Committee, four township rallies have
been held this week and a full sche
dule for next week arranged. Meet
ings were held at the town hall at
Zone, in Franklin township on Mon
day night, at Haller school house in
North ifork on Tuesday evening, at
Grange Hall, Brailey, in East Swan
Creek on Wednesday night and at
the voting place in South York, on
Thursday night, at each of the first
three of these places the house of
meeting was filled to its capacity and
the crowds were enthusiastic and
every one of the meetings resulted in
adding votes for the straight Republi
can ticket. The issues of this cam
paign were presented by various
members of the party of candidates
for office on the county ticket, and
the old spirit of Republican good fel
lowship was revived.
Two big meetings are scheduled for
Wauseon next week: Governor Willis
will speak at the court house at 9:30
Wednesday morning and as this will
be the last opportunity of hearing Mr.
Willis in Fulton county daring the
campaign there will be a crowd from
all over the county to greet him.
Appropos of Governor Willis' cam
paign for re-election; the emissaries
of the State Democratic Committee
have put in circulation of bogus peti
tions asking Governor Willis not to
repeal the Workmen's Compensation
Act thus putting a false interpreta
tion on the .position of the Governor
relative-to that act, the folio wine state
ment from Chairman 'Hatfield of the!
Kepublican State Central Committee
is self explanatory:
Reliable reports from over the
state of bogus petitions circulated by
Democratic emissaries indicate the
desperate straits to which the Cox
organization has been forced in its
endeavor to misrepresent the position
of the Willis administration pn the
Workmen's Compensation Act. It
will not succeed because of the intelli
gence of Ohio voters.
Into the office of the Republican
State Executive Committee there came
voluntarily today a Democrat who
was of much influence on the Senate
Labor Committee at the time of the
passage of this Act. In justice to
Governor Willis, he said he wished
to sav that he had talked freelv with
; Senator Green at the time of the con
ference at the home of Governor Cox.

sation insurance, the provision so in
terpreted by the Supreme Court. This
Democratic labor committeeman said
the, following this conference Mr.
Green was much depressed, that he
freely expressed to his collegues his
fear3 of tne effect of this amendment,
but that it was an ultimatum; either
the amendment of the Governor must
be accepted or the bill could not be
passed.
CHAS. S. HATFIELD.
Governor Willis has the following
to say in regard to the matter:
I am informed that over the state,
Democratic emissaries are circulating
bogus petitions directed to me, ask
ing that I not repeal the Workmen's
Compensation Act. No more false or
contemptible canard has ever been
attempted in Ohio politics. It em
anates from the same class of men
who have not hesitat.pd
own acts in attempts to again fooL
the people of Ohio if it is in their
puwer 10 ao so. fortunately, the
working people of Ohio are intelli
gent, and quickly grasp the real pur
port of such fake tactics as this.
I have no power to repeal the Work
men's ComDensation Law nnH T
not repeal it if I had the power. I
am now, and always have been,
strongly in favor cf the Workmen's;
Compensation Law. The Republican;
party and myself, personally, are de-j
finitely and fully pledged to its main-1
tenance. j
' I believe that, tin a watI-itut mon
Ohio will accept this pledge rather
than the canard of the men who forc
ed into the present law the amend
ment giving private companies the
I right to write compensation in Ohio,
according to the decision "of the Su
! Dreme Court., and whn now kroIt n
! evade responsibility for their own
acis.

can National Committee and the Kon.

NOTICE TO TAXPAYERS.
Before the tax laws were changed
in 1913 the rates were made in June
each year and the taxes were spread
and could be paid as early as October
1st. Now rates cannot be made un
til August and it neccessarily delays
the work and the Treasurer cannot
commence to receive taxes before No
vember 1st, at the very earliest. This
is the reason early inquiries about
taxes cannot be answered.
G. SCOTT ROOS, Treasurer.

FROM THE COURTS
Thirty Day Race Between The Pro
bate and Common Pleas Courts Di
vorce Cases New Cases Petit
Jury on Duty Monday October 23rd.
Try Tribune advertising and note
the results.
From the seventeenth of September
to the seventeenth of October, so we
are informed the Probate Court of
Fulton county issued sixteen mar
riage licenses; during the same thir
ty days ten divorce cases were filed
in the court of Common Pleas. Six
teen to teen is not a ratio to be proud
of in this connection Bryan's old Free
tsiiver ratio ot lb to 1 would be bet
ter. However the fault lies not with
the courts or the lawyers, but with
the people who for some reason or
reasons fail to make a success of
matrimony. Magazine writers galore
have spread gallons of ink on this
subject of matrimony eugenics, do
mestic science, marriage laws and
the anathemas of .the churches have
all been brought to bear on the sub
ject, and still people keep on marry
ing and trying to get unmarried and
the courts get them at both ends of
the line. The welfare of this coun
try depends not so much upon the -multitude
of laws that may be en
acted nor upon the politician and
the reform agitator that go about
seeking whom they may annex, as
it does upon the homes of the land
in which one man and one woman are
working together in real comradeship
to build for themselves and their
children conditions of happiness well
being and sane living. It is up to the
young people of this country, to take
account of themselves and each other
and be content with the other as a
work fellow and partner in .the busi
ness of living and each determine to
do faithfully and loyally their part
before they enter into a relationship
which binds them together as one.
Mistakes will undoubtedly be made,
but they ought not come in a ratio
of ten to sixteen. -
Three divorce cases were before the
common pleas court this week two on
Wednesday and one on Friday and
three more are among the new cases
hied in court this week: Thomas
Riches vs Mary Ann Riches, divorce.
Ruth L. Russell vs Wm. J. Russell,
alimony. Mable Barnes vs Lewis
Barnes, divorce and equitable relief.
One other new case filed is that of
Calvin L. Reed vs" Stephen E. Bisson-
nette, money only,, amount claimed
$200 and costs. ' i '
