VERY SUCCESSFUL
TEACHERS INSIU1E
f
ijl Sessions Held Monday and Tuea-
- day Well Attended and
Prove Interesting.
PROF. PAUL AND MISS
HOLLISTER PRESENT.
Interesting Lecture on Plant and
Bird Life, Also on Other Im
portant Subjects.
The fall session of the Iron County
Teachers' Institute was held in Cedar
City last Monday and Tuesday. Prof.
J. H. Paul and Mrs. Hollister of the
State University were in attendance
to (rive instruction and assistance to
the teachers in the mastering of their
every day problems and difficulties.
Pleasing songs and choruses were
rendered by the pupils of the Cedar
City schools, under the direction of
Prof. Knudsen of the B. A. C. faculty.
Vocal solos were rendered during the
various sessions by Mr. Knudsen and
Mr. Obcrhanslie, piano selections by
Miss Gardner and Pratt Tollestrup,
and a reading was given by Miss Sym
onds. Prof. Paul on Plant Life.
At the Monday morning session
Prof. Paul spoke before the joint con
vention on the subject of Plant Life,
discussing the various fall weeds
found flourishing in various parts of
the city, in their relation to the farm
er and stock man, either as a benefit
or a weed pest. Considered it the
fduty of the teachers to take steps to
eradicate such dangerous weeds as
the Canadian thistle, hoarhound and
cockelbur, and advised them to enlist
the aid of the women in the under
taking, as he had found them valuable
aids in similar work in other localities.
Prof. Paul also put in a plea for
the preservation of our white sage,
which is so valuable for a forage
plant and is in danger of extermination.
The Essentials of a Teacher.
The second half of the morning per
iod was occupied by Mrs. Hollister in
discussing the Essentials of a Teach
er. Said the teacher must have tol
eration for the deficiencies found, but
be able to lift the situation up to
where he wants it. Must have educa
tion to know and appreciate the child's
standpoint; must have "appreciation"
of his own work and of himself; "con
cern" for the child's life and physical
well-being; must have "health", "ef
ficiency" and be "resourceful."
"The educated person is the one
who knows what to do next."
The Afternoon Session.
Beginning at 2 o'clock the first hour
was occupied by Mrs. Hollister with u
most comprehensive talk on Stories
and Story Telling, to which the gen
eral public were invited. A crowded
audience responded and were highly
edified by the ideas presented. The
remainder of the afternoon was oc
cupied with departmental work.
Tuesday morning the conjoint part
of the session was occupied with a
talk on Reading by Mrs. Hollister,
after which the members separated
for depart mental work.
In ths afternoon session Mr. Crock
er of Buckhorn gave a paper on Li
brary improvements for the county
schools, and presented a set of reso
lutions for the consideration of the
members, providing for the founding
of a circulating library for the county.

talk on Penmanship, showing the nee-
esslty of the training of pupils to the

ALBANIA STARVING
UNHEEDED TO DEATH
While Other Suffering European Na
tions are Liberally Fed AppealH
From Albania Unheeded.
While the people of the United
States have been sending thirty mil
lion dollars' worth of relief to Europe
and Turkey, two hundred thousand
I women and children in Albania have
I died of starvation.
While each woman and child in Bel-
gium has had plenty to eat, women
I and children in Albania have gnawed
at the carcasses of dead horses in the
streets.
r William Willard Howard, of New
York, who has returned from his third
trip to this hunger zone of Europe,
predicts that the entire population of
Albania will die of famine and pesti
lence unless helped. He says that in
Albania corn is fifty dollars a bushel,
flour eighty dollars a sack, and mac
aroni five dollars a pound.
"The tragedy of Albania," says Mr.
Howard, "is that a nation is dying of
hunger, while the people of the United
States, laden with gifts for the rest
of Europe and for Turkey, pass by on
the other side.
"Thirty millions of dollars have
been given by the people of the Unit
ed States for relief work of various
kinds in Belgium, Poland,' Armenia,
Syria and the warring countries of
Europe, while two hundred thousand
women and children in Southeastern
Europe have starved to death unheed
ed and uncared for. Not one woman
or child has died of hunger in Bel
gium; two hundred thousand in Al
bnnia. "Is it fair is it human that the
innocent women and children of Al
bania, who never did anyone any
harm, should be trampled under foot
and left to perish, at a time when all
others are red?
"Is this American fair play?
"I have appealed for help in high
places. I have begged a crust of
bread of those who have given mil
lions to Belgium, Poland, Armenia
and Syria. I have begged in vain.-
"The Albanians are bb much enti
tled to sympathy and help as others.
They have not taken part in the war.
They fed and sheltered the refugees
from Servia, even with the last meas
ure of corn that the famine-smitten
villages possessed. They have not
done any wrong; yet armies have
swept over the country, taking what
could be found to take, leaving to the
starving women and children only the
carcasses of dead horses in the
streets.
"I ask only American fair play for
the famished children of Albania. I
ask of all fair-minded men and women
in the United States: Why should the
Albanians three hundred thousand of
whom are Christians be left to
starve, while we pass forward, In gen
erous rivalry, to feed the others?
The Albanians are more numerous
than the Armenians; yet we feed the
Armenians and let the Albanians
starve.
"Having appealed to deaf ears in
high places I now appeal to the plain
people to fair minded men and wom
en who would not let even a dog starve
to death, no matter what his breed
I want to po back to Albania with a
shipload of food. I have arranged for
a ship a new American ship, just
launched and fitted for sea. Tne ship
is ready and waiting.
"A number of distinguished gentle
men in New York mostly clergymen
and editors of newspapers will co
operate in an appeal for a relief carpo
for the ship. The treasurer selected
to receive contributions is the Rev.
Frederick Lynch, D. D., editor of The
Christian Work and secretary of the
Carnegie Church Peace Union. Con
tributions in any amount from the
price of a loaf of bread upward may
be sent to the Balkan Relief Fund, 70
Fifth avenue, New York City."
Boy Has Narrow Escape.
What came near being a most ser
ious accident occurred on North Main
street Wednesday when Thomas Thor
ley, son of David Thorley, ran over
Horace Rosenberg with his automo
bile, knocking him down and severely
bruising him. The injured boy was
taken to Dr. Macfarlane's office and
his injuries which proved to not be of
a dangerous nature, were dressed. It
appears that Thorley turned out of
his road to miss a colt, and the boy
who was crossing the stret at the same
time became confused and could not
tell which way to go to avoid the car.
It is probable that in this case there
was no one directly to blame for the
accident, but it serves to show how
easy it is for serious accidents to oc
cur with cars, and should be a warn
ing for those entrusted with the hand
ling of them to use all care and dilli
gence to avoid accidents.
Studebaker Recruiting Car.
A Studebaker commercial car of the
combination station and express wag
on type has been pressed into service
for getting recruits for the U. S.
Marine corps. The machine was pur
chased by Lieut. J. W. McClaskey,
who is in charge of the recruiting dis
trict of San Francisco for the marine
corps. It makes trips up and down
the entire Pacific coast, in connection
with publicity work to stimulate en-'
listments.
C. H. Hobbs, the teacher at Latimer,
this county, was in attendance at the

IN INTEREST OF
FEEBLEMINDED
State Commission Desire Co-opera-
lion in Effort to Beach Those
Kequiiinc Assistance.
Salt Lake Citv. October 17, 1916
Editor Iron Conntv Record, Cedar
City. Utah. During the 1916 session
of the Utah legislature a hill was
gMMd creatine a Commission on
Provision for the Feeble-minded This
nil! rave the governor power to ap
point three commissioners who were
to serve without pnv. The hill carried
an appropriation of $500 as an ex
pense fund.
Governor William Spry appointed
the following men to net op this com
mission: D. H. Calder. M. D, Prove
Charles G. Phimmer. M. D., and f'
O. Cownns. M. D., of Salt Lake City.'
The commission organized with two
members, Dr. Calder hetno- nt tut M,
state. Thev employed Miss Sadie
Myers of Salt Lake City as a field
workex nnd she has bepn at work since
August 1st last.
Cooperating with the Utah com
mission is the Nathional Committee
op Provision for the Feeble-minded
with headquarters at Philadelphia. Pa
Joseph P Ryers, secretary of the
Nationnl Committee came to Salt
Lake Pity in August for a conference
with the Utah commission and wnile I
here promised the ranvrt of his or-!
e-anizntion in every er,..- Utah put1
forth to make l men'-'' v. y 0f jt ,

the Nathionnl Committee I t,. Utah i
Miss Jane C-iTtths. an XOPritnctdl
field-worker, to take up th work with I
us in order to hnrrv fn effort forward I
with all disnatch. This was done at
no expense to us excent the livinp
expenses of Miss r:riff)ths while she
is enpaged in helping to make this
survey.
The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints is behind the effort
and doing all in its nower to nid us.
The commission lias 'one a step furth
er and enlisted the aymoathy nnd co
operation of the dopa-monts of so
ciology and psvcholopv in the Univer
sity of Utah, the Agricultural College
of Utah, and the Brigham Young
University, urging these schools to
allow their students in these depart
ments to join our field-workers in
making the survey and lend their aid
in a practical way to furthering the
endeavors of the commission. The
teaching forces of all the urbap and
rural schools in the state are deeply
interested in the progress of this sur
vey. The physicians of the state have
also been importuned to add their in
fluence in petting in touch with all re
tarded individuals who come under
their observation, nnd report the same
to the commission or its field-workers.
The commission desires to put forth
still greater efforts to assemble and
utilize all the resources of the state
bv asking many powerful newspapers
of Utah to cooperate in the endeavor
to get as wide publicity as possible of
the work planned by the commis
sioners. To this end 'we ask of the
editors the favor of scndlnp copy to
them for local use once in a while that
will be descriptive of the methods
employed in makintr this survey of the
mentally retarded individuals in Utah,
as well ns explanatory of the needs of
this preat question being brought
prominently before all of our citizens I
In this wise a publicity campaign may
be waped without expense to the com-1
mission, which is limited to such a
nail expenditure, and a workinpl
knowledge of the methods being em
ployed in this and other states to as
certain the number of defectives in
this state may be gained. This effort
will give only facts of the utmost im
portance to all and in such a way that
no offense can be taken by anyone.
The commission wishes to go on
record with the statement that at
this time it is engaged only in an
effort to ascertain the number of in
dividuals in Utah whose mentality
should be measured. Any aid you may
be able to pive us in the way of
space for publicity in your valuable
paper, or any editorial effort put forth
along suggested lines of improvement
of our people, will he greatly appela
ted by the commission and' its large
corps of workers. We enlist your
sympathies and we wish to engage
your efforts to help ameliorate the
condition of many unfortunates in our
midst. An early reply is solicited.
Yours with kindest regards,
CHARLES O. PLUMMER,
Acting Chairman for the Commis
sion, 405 East South Temple Street, I

THE PROPOSED CONSTI
TUTIONAL AMENDMENT
The following article on the ques
tion of Taxation and the purpose of
the proposed Constitutional amend
ment to be voted for at the approach
ing election, is from the pen of one of
the best posted men in the state on
this subject, and has the full endorse
ment of The Record. This is vital
question to the masses of the people
of the state, but is beinp opposed by
the owners of larpe mines, in whose
pay some of the prominent daily pa
ne of the state are assisting in try
ing to defeat the measure. In cast
ing your vote at the cominp election,
be sure to vote yes on the amendment.
The question naturally arises in the
minds of the tnv pnvers, "What is
the moaning of the proposed amend
ment to the Constitution, and why are
i nc m,n'ng companies opposinp it"
In the first place, are there any logical
reasons why a home should be re
quired to pny as much tax as a farm
a mine, a mercantile institution or anv
business that hrinps in a revenue'
No fair minded person would main
tain for a moment that it should.
Section one of the proposed amend
ment that is now beinp submitted to
the people to be voted upon if carried
at the next election will permit the
legislature to classify the property of
the state and thus exempt the home
rrom some of its present burden if
it fails to carry it will under our pres
ent law be obliped to bear the same
,as ny other class of property.
The next in that proposed amend
ment is one that affects the mine and
me reason why they are spendinp so
much money to oppose it, Is that the
old constitution protects the mines to
the extent that they can only be as
sessed on their net proceeds The
net proceeds of a mine are determined
ty taking the value of all the ore ex
tracted in one year and deduct inp
therefrom the costs of extraction,
freipht and reduction of the ore, and
what is left represents the value of
the mine, together with the price paid
the government for the land, which is
uniformly on metaliferous mines, $R
per acre.
Where is there a farmer who would
not like to have his farm assessed in
thia way? For inrtanca: 1.25 per
acre for the land, the price paid the
povernment, and what profits mipht
be over and above the cost of runninp
the farm, and yet this is the way a
mine is assessed. This mipht have
been reasonably fair when all other
property in the state was assessed at
one-third of its value, which was the
case on an averape prior to 1916.
Rut the last lepislature took from
the various levying boards sixty per
cent of their authority, which made it
necessary to raise all property in the
state two and one-half times to raise
the same money. This, however,
could not be done with the net pro
ceeds of the mines, which as stated
above, represents the value of the
mines.
Here are a few fipures which show
clearly what it means to one of the
big minesif the state. Their net pro
ceeds for 1915 were $15,741,480 00
Apainst this value was applied 12.02
mills, which makes them pay ?165,
172.00. Had the same levies applied
as did in 1915 before the reduction,
they would have paid on 29.89 mills
or $410,732.00. This is what the re
duction of levies did for this mine--saved
it $2 45,500.00. Thev can well
afford to oppose the amendment. The
lepislature understood this and au
thorized the amendment as it is now
presented to us, which if it rarrioi
will permit them to mako law.; assess
ing the net proceeds at three times,
which will practically put them --the
mines where they were bofore the re
duction in leviei nnd tlnp the will
pay no more than their rhare.
BOUNTIES ON WILD
PREDATORY ANIMALS
County Clerk Civea Information as to
Amounts Offered and Pro
cedure Necessary.
Parowan, Utah, Oct. 19, l'.HO.
Editor Iron County Record. I have
frequent inquiries reparding the boun
ty on various animals, and the proced
ure necessary to pet same, and for the
information of y0ur readers, I wish
you WOUloTOe kind enouph to publish
the following:
The State of Utah pays a bounty of
$15,00 each for bears, lions, cougars i
and prey, black nnd timber wolves,
and $1.50 each mi coyotes, lynx and
wild cats. To et the bounty on same
it is necessary to present skin with
ears, entire tail and paws connected
with the bone in the fore paws to the
first joint, to the County Clerk of the
county in which said nninial- were
killed, within 60 days after they were
killed, and sipn an affidavit that you
killed them in said county within the
time mentioned It is therefore im
possible for the cleik to receive such
skins by muil and forward the bounty
to the individual, as he is frequently
requested to do, or to bounty them
when presented by an individual who
did not kill them. No bounty is beinp
paid on rabbits, nor has the County
any poison for the purpose of killing
these animals at this time.
I shall be plad to furnish additional
information upon request.
