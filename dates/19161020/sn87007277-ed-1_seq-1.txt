Would Do Away With Bleachers and
Have 25 and 50-Cent Grandstand
Sections Move Should Be
Popular With Patrons.
Manager Jack Holland of the St. Jo
seph team thinks he has In n large
measure discovered the reason for the
small attendance at ball games
hot weather. He has come to the
conclusion that the bleacher fnna whn
are his best patrons, will not go to
ino nan park on an extremely wa
day on account of the heat, nmi ti
a gOOd many Of them ennnnt nffn
to pay 50 cents for a grandstand
seat.
"Next season, no matter t
am whether it Is In St. Joseph pt
some otner city I am going to do
away with the bleachers and hmA
twenty-five and fifty cent grandstand
bwuoub, nouand said. "If I stay m
ou Joseph 1 shall reni-ranee thn KtnnAi
uu me piaying new. The bleachefs
will be removed. There will be about
fifteen hundred twenty-five cent seats
in a section at the north pnH nf tho
grandstand and an addition will be
built to the south end of the grand
stand for fifty-cent seats."
This move on the part of Holland
should bo decidedly popular with the
bleacher fans. Jack says that the
bleacher Idea is a mistake in base
ball and that the time Is coming when
the minor leagues will realize It. He
takes the stand that the bleacherlte
is the steadiest patron of the national
gnme and that a little more attentlen
should be given to caring for his
comfort and convenience.

the other day.

REASON FOR DEFEAT
One Saturday afternoon dur
ing the SDrimr training- senann
the Glantr ' second team dropped
a game to the Waco club of the
Texas league. It was said later
that the reason for the defeat
was that the youngsters had
overeaten at luncheon. This
! was borne out by one of the
"bushers."
"We did eat too much," he
said, "but there was a reason.
We had breakfast at elirhr-
thlrty and didn't get anything
more to eat until nearly tun
o'clock. We sure were hungry."
"Do you mean to say you had
to go without food for more
than five hours?" he was asked.
"Yes, we did," he answered
vehemently.

One stands on the army commander'

control the seas. As far as one can
see, either up or down the river, there
are ocean-going ships tugging at an
chor chains drawn taunt as bow strings
by the swift current. The ships are
anchored one behind tho other In a
long column. They hall from many
corners of the earth and among their
ourgoes one may find everything from
n big howitzer shell to a skein of em
broidery for some Arab harem. The
