IV I Hie nine men Inside are yet alive the
| officials in charge of the rescue work
' at Jamison Mine No. 7 are endeavoring
_ to repair the cage at Shaft B, which
e was the least damaged by the explosion.
The body of A. W. Vance, machine
boss, was found near the bottom of
this shaft last night by the rescue
party, which explored a portion of
the workings, and was brought outside.
4- L. M. Jones, chief of the mine resof
cue car, ventured too far and was
q. killed by tho poisonous monoxide gus.
. It is thought that Jones' helmet
i must have leaked as his oxygen tank
0 contained sufficient for two hours. He
J. was in advance of the party of rescue
men and was searching for four of
the men who were thought to have
been working near the bottom of the
a shaft.
lc When he was overcome his companions
carried him to the bottom whero
n the air was breathable. They were
1t j compelled to ascend two or three
_ i times and make the long trip with tha
lC ! body in relays.
'; | When lie was brought to the bottom
I he had been dead perhaps forty min3f
utes and the efforts of tho men to restore
life by means of the lungmotor
IU from the Fairmont Fire department
a. wore unavailing.
The rescue party that first entered
about midnight contained eight men,
t?. these were L. M. Jones, chief In charge
fmntthe rescue car,. L. W. Cooper, as
te slstant chief engineer of the Jamlson
company, J. W. Koster, A. J.
,a strain, E. H. Selp. J. B. Berry, G. 8.
McCaa and Superintendent Beerbower.
All of these men are from Pittsburgh
except Cooper and Beerbower who live
In Fairmont.
This party descended on a temporary
platform that was lowered down
Shatt B.
I All of the workings near the bottom
ot the shaft and as far as the stables,
which are about a half mile from
the bottom, were explored.
Canary blrdB that were taken Inside
by the party dropped dead almost in,
stantly from the poisonous monoxide
'?< gas that filled the mine. Although one
of the fans beside this shaft had been
repaired early In the evening and had
been blowing fresh air In the mine
for several hours, the damage to the
brattice work Inside prevented It from
penetrating more than a hundred feet
lt from the entrance.
y The explosion is thought to have
q Originated In Main heading A, which
n runs southwest from the opening and
ir nearly all of the entombed men are
;e thought to be in the south Bectlon.near
y this beading. The rescue party was
p. In the mine all night and did not aban,8
don the search for bodies until 7:
i. this morning when they all came to
n the surface. The bodies of Jones and
k Vance had been brought out about one
g o'clock a. m.
Members ot the rescue party came
l- outside at intervals to renew the Bupif
ply of oxygen In their tanks. Four district
mine inspectors are in charge
it of the work at the mine today these
s being Frank Parsons, Clarksburg; W.
e B. Hlggleman, Fairmont; O. R. Cook,

had been in the mine It was decided
that further search for bodies would
be useless, as all of the men would
1 have been dead by that time and fearing
more deaths should the rescue
r party attempt to further explore the
? workings, this work was abandoned.
Today the work of repairing the
cage at shaft B is being rapdlly pushd
ed and by tonight It is expected to be
d in working order. No one entered the
if mine today but a party of machinists
b were working downshaft B repairing
the guides and the passageway so that
the cage can be lowered when it is re's
placed. None of the officials on the
jp ground think that it will be possible to

' which the hoisting cage works, the
I foul noxious vapors pour 0ut and as>
cend as a noisome pestilence from the
t tomb below. All of the remaining
, openings to the mine are closed with
j brattice cloth. There are but three
entrances to the mine and one of
these, shaft C. has never been used,
being designed for an additional hoisting
cage when the mine has grown
i bo large as to need It.
s The machinery and outside equip.
