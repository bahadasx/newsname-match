A Fish Story From Headquarters.
A three days' fish story of unusual
proportions and unquestioned authen
ticity was enacted early this week out
at the big artificiial lake on Deer
Flat. The big headgate was shut
down cutting off the water from the
main canal and leaving multitudes of
the finny tribe stranded in the mud
or struggling for life in pools large
and small.
In order to save the game fish
which would otherwise perish, Deputy
Game Warden and a corps of assist
ants were on hand to rescue the de
sirable in size and variety, these to be
renlanted in other waters. Some will
bo back into the Lower Boise, some
into the Snake river, others to various
sloughs throughout U*e valley. Some
will be turned loose in small streams
in Jordan Valley and the real tristo
crats will find ijuarters suited to their
superior needs in the Payette lakes.
Men from the U. S. R. S. camps and
local sportsmen together with farm
ers in the Deer Flact section co
operated with the game warden in
making the big catch which means
much for the future of the finny tribe
in this section, since the number cap
tured alive has been variously esti
mated between one and two million.
Containers and seines were furnished
by the game department, thus facili
tating the work. Monday and Tues
day were put in at the lower outlet,
while the upper dam was the scene of
operations on Wednesday. Crowds
from Caldwell, Nanipa and Boise
watched and assisted in the conserva
tion process, and the few who have
not enjoyed a meal or two of fish this
week must have ben either sick or had
not the means or the price of transpor
tation to the reservoir. Only the perch
and the bass were saved, some of the
largest of the latter making a spec
tacular dash for liberty in deeper
water.
The water was turned into the canal
again this—Thursday—morning to aid
in some construction work. When this
is completed, it will be turned in again
for a time. Another saving of fish
will be effected with this final shutting
off of the water.
Mr. and Mrs. Louis Schnabel and
little son leave Saturday for Mitchel
ville, Iowa, where they expect to
spend the winter. The trip is for the
special benefit of Schnabel Jr., who in
sists an visiting his grandmother.
W. C. Bicknell was transacting busi
ness in Payette Saturday of last week.
Library Work Progressing.
1 he work of catalogueing the books
at the Carnegie Library is progressing
nicely under the efficient management
of Miss Ellinwood who has been di
recting and assisting in this work for
the past few weeks. Classification of
the books is practically completed and
the work of listing in alphabetic order
will next be taken up.
A new catalogue case has been or
dered and is exnected any day. The
task of catalogueing is a tedious one
and requires the services of an expert,
a role which Miss Ellinwood fills to a
nicety. When the work is completed,
our library will be up to standard and
a joy to those who frequent this liter
ary stronghold.
Pantorium Changes Hands.
This week the Pantorium, hereto
fore operated by H. R. Hammond, was
purchased by Harold Hoobler, for
merly of Meridian and Baker City.
Mr. Hoobler will remodel the Pantor
ium and install the most modern
equipment such as is used in the more
progressive shops of this kind, and
assures the people of Caldwell that he
is in position to give them the best
possible service in the way of tailor
ing cleaning and pressing.
Mr. Hoobler has had years of ex
perience in this line and with his ad
vanced equipment, including auto de
livery, will prove a valuable addition
to the business institutions of the city.
Methodist Church.
The pastor will preach Sunday
morning on "The Leaven." In the
evening he will preach on the topic
"For Better or for Worse," an addess
to young people
The Rally Day program was a de
cided success both morning and even
ing. Graduates from both the cradle
roll and primarv departments received
their diplomas in the morning. The
intermediate department was repre
sented by Earl Elhart, Philip Paine
and Ada Lee in the evening and Dr.
Boone, of the College of Idaho, gave
an address an Pioneers of the North
west, which was highlv appreciated.
Mrs. R. W. Ookes, who is now in
Spokane in attendance at the North
west Branch of the W. F. M. S., has
been elected a delegate to the general
executive meeting at Minneapolis,
which meets next month. This is an

Minister in Toils.
Rev. B. W. Rice is serving an inde
terminate sentence in Canyon hospital,
sentence having been pronounced by :i
reputable medical authoritv on Mon
day and transfer to the institution
being effected the same day, Rheu
matism in the thirty-third degree with
all possible variations was the charge,
which was not denied by the accused
who is suffering the penalty of an
offense the precise nature of which
has not yet been determined, but the
doubhterresults of which are not to' be
doubted. The sentence imposed in
cluded a solitary confinement clause
which excludes from his presence for
a week all save his wife and son. Rev.
Rice's many friends will as glad as he
when this part of the order is rescind
ed and still more rejoiced when he is
again able to go about his regular
duties.
Fire at Fair Grounds.
A fire of unknown origin wined out
the grand stand, the bleachers on the
east, the judge's stand, and a number
of the barns last Sunday afternoon at
the Idaho State Fair grounds. The
blaze evidently started in the straw
used to lay the dust on the grounds
during the fair in the present month.
The unwise placing of fire hydrants in
that vicinity together with a stiff
breeze made it impossible for the fire
denartment to control the blaze.
The loss is estimated at about $3500
and the insurance figures up in the
neighborhood of $700 or $800. Presi
dent Holt states that the Fair asso
ciation was never in better condition
financially, and though the loss is re
grettable, it will in no way interfere
with next year's fair.
Wisner-Harding.
A prettv home wedding was solemn
ized on Thursday evening of last week

formed at 6:30 by Rev. J. G. Cowden.
The bride has many friends in Cald

The groom is a young business man of
Denver. Mr. and Mrs. Harding leave

NAMPA 00GT0RS HOLD
ROSS IN RESPECT
AND ESTEEM
Nampa, Idaho, October 16. 1916.
Mr. Jno. Davis, Editor Caldwell Tri
bune, Caldwell, Idaho.
Dear Sir:—We notice in your paper
of October 6, 1916. that you give con
siderable space to the case of E. V.
Huntzberry, who was adjudged inçane
in the probate court of Canyon county
by a board of physicians of which Dr.
H. P. Ross of our city was a member.
We notice that in editorial comment
and otherwise you, possibly uninten
tionally, give the impression to your
readers that the physicians in ques
tion were instructed in advance and
lent their services to defeat the ends
of justice. The true physician is one
of the greatest, if not the greatest, fac
tor in the prevention of moral as well
as physical ills.
From our personal acquaintance
with Dr. Ross who has practiced his
profession in this community for
about 12 years, we as physicians know
him to be a true physician—a man of
j moral integrity—one whom we believe
' could not be persuaded to lend himself
I or sell himself to anything not in
keping with his judgment of the facts,
and whose "rofessional ability is well
and very favorably known to us and
whose judgment in a case of this kind
we are quite willing to accept.
We certainly commend your ritlit
eous indignation at such terrible
crimes and your efforts to bring the
offender to justice but we positively
condemn your unjust accusations
against our fellow physician, and
through him the medical fraternity of
this city.
We feel that perhaps, in your zeal
to bring an offender to justice, you
have made these stateménts without
due consideration of the accusation im
plied or the injury done to innocent
and well meaning citizens.
You say that E. V. Huntzberry is
accused of a heinous crime against
nature. We believe that our great
effort should be toward the prevention
of such damnable practice in the
future. Hence is it not better to con
fine such cases in our state insane
asylum indefinitely than to sentence
them to a term of years in the peniten
tiary to again be released to resume
their terrible crimes?
We sincerely regret having to cal!
your attention to this matter and ask
you to give it your careful considéra
tion and, if possible, space in your
next issue.
Yours sincerely,
GEO. O. A. KELLOG. M. D.

Night Schools a Possibility.
In response to a number of inquiries
from young people whose daytime
duties preclude the possibility of
school work in regular hours, Super
intendent H. H. Clifford and the board
of trustees arc considering the advis
ability of putting in a night course
with the same teaching force in
charge. No age limit has been de
termined upon, the one requisite under
consideration being an ambition that
overrides obstacles and fits circum
stances to its own needs.
The inquiries received so far are
along vocational lines and would mean
the organization of classes in domestic
science and manual training, though
other subjects arc not barred, the only
requirement being that not less than
ten may enroll in each class.
A nominal tuition fee would be
charged to meet the extra*efforts of
the teachers in charge and to cover
any other expense features of such an
arrangement.
Night classes in large cities have
come to be quite common, a natural
outgrowth of broader ideas of what
constitutes an education, and manifest
a courageous effort on the part of
young people—not always those of
school age either—to get, through this
adaptation of the public school sys
tem, the practical information and
training which each needs. That Cald
well should line up with this progres
sive tendency is what might be ex
pected, and reflects much credit upon
the ambitious inquirers as well as up
on the school board and the teachers
whose work would be not a whit
lightened by the instruction of night
sessions.
War's Women which comes to the
Huree Theatro, Thursday, October
26th, is the most daring bit of tense
drama ever staged for the screen or
dramatic stage. It deals with a ter
rible side light on the horrors of
war, the despoilation of women. There
is no denying the fact that the direc
tor and his great mast have made the
lesson plain, teribly plain, and it hits
and hits hard. Viewed as a dramatic
production of the season it grips, holds
and compells attention. The develop
ment is perfect with a tempo that
builds from one tense situation to an
other. Frank Kcnnan has the great
est part he has ever touched on the
stage or before the camera. He makes
it truly terrible and most convincing
in point of power and brutality. By
all means see War's Women. But go
prepared for tense, powerful, terrible
frankness.

Judge, returned home from the south

SENATOR BORAH GIVEN
WARM RECEPTION
IN CALDWELL
Saturday of last week Senator
Borah was in Caldwell for a couple of
hours. He was tendered a reception
at the Commercial club. The people
of Caldwell showed that they were
well pleased to see Senator Borah
again.
After much urging Senator Borah
addressed those present, lie said:
My friends, I had not intended to
make any speeches in this part of
Idaho at fliis time, excepting the one
for which I am billed tonight at
Weiser.
As you know, I am speaking in this
campaign under the auspices of the
National Republican Committee and
my time is fullv taken up. I was gald,
however, that it was made possible for
me to again visit my home state even
for a short period and I assure you il
is always one of the great pleasures of
my life to be permitted to mingle with
my fellow citizens at home and to ex
tend to them the hand of greeting and
fellowship.
It is not possible in the few mo
ments that 1 will be here to indulge
in any extensive remarks, although I
hope later in the campaign to be able
to return and to address you people
more at length.
We are all interested more or less
in politics at the present moment and
you naturally expect me, if I say any
thing. to say something along political
lines, and I will devote just a few
minutes to that subject, yet without at
tempting to discuss either national or
state issues, which would be impos
sible within the time.
I am free to confess to you that I
have not always been satisfied with
the conditions existing in both the
great political parties. Those at the
head of these parties have at times
been under the domination of influ
ences that were, in my opinion, inimi
cal to the walfare of the people of this
country.
Occasionally, however, there have
arisen men who have the moral cour
age to combat'those influences and to
bring about a more healthful political
condition in the United States; and I
want to say to you, my friends, that
there is nothing that has occurred in
sometime that has given me grrnteT
hope of a purification of American
politics than the nomination of the
man who is today the standard bearer
of the Republican party— Chas. E.
Hughes,
As a citizen of New York and as gov
ernor of that great state he was most
effective in fighting those interests
that have exerted an unwholesome in
fluence upon our politics. You will
remember his courageous attack upon
corrupt insurance company methods
which resulted in a complete qverturn
ing of an old and most damnable sys
tem and in the guaranty of a fair deal
to stockholders and absolute protec
tion to policy holders. This work at
tracted nation-wide attention to Mr.
Hughes.
I have no time to go into the details
of his public career but I want to call
your attention to one fact that should
impress upon your minds the splendid
moral fibre of this man.
You all know that in this campaign
New York is a pivotal state. Many be
lieve, and I must agree with them,
that as New York goes, so will go the
presidential election. It is important,
therefore, to control that state and a
great deal of attention is being paid
to it, but notwithstanding this situa
tion, it was not over 24 hours after
Mr. Hughes had accepted the nomina
tion that he dropper over-board one
of the most powerful and resourceful
political bosses in this nation—Wm.
B a en es, Jr., of New York. He does
not approve of Mr. Barnes and his
methods and would rather he defeated
through loss of New York, by an
tagonizing Mr. Barnes, than to be
elected bv his support, carrying with it
a surrender to the methods employed
by that powerful political boss. That
was a courageous thing to do, my fel
low citizens, and clearly indicates the
high character of administration you
may expect if Mr. Hughes shall be
elected.
But have vou heard of President
Wilson dropping out of his organiza
tion, Tom Taggart, the Democratic
boss of Indiana and owner of that
great gambling establishment of
French Lick Springs? Have you ever
heard of President Wilson dropping
from his organization, Roger Sullivan,
the great Democratic boss of Illinois,
or have you heard of President Wilson
dropping from his organization. Mur
phy. the Tammany boss? You have
not. It requires the highest type of
moral courage to antagonize such
powerful political influences and few
j men possess it. Mr. Hughes possesses
I it and lie uses it.
j Now, with relation to the Republi
can state ticket, 1 want to say that I,
fas a Republican, can give it my most
j hearty support, because it is composed
of clean, representative citizens who,
I if elected, will give the people of Ida
I ho an efficient, practical and economi
| cal administration.
We had our preferences in the pri
i mary campaign, which was a spirited
lone although fought on a high plane.
I Strong and capable men competed for
the places of honor. The result has
given us a ticket for which all Re
publicans can stand and which we can
aggressively support.
In this campaign, the Republicans
of Idaho are again united. The fac
tional differences of 1912 have been
laid aside. We present a solid front
to the opposition. This is
Republican state and all that is neces
sary at the »resent time in order to
carry Idaho for the Republican Na
tional and state tickets is for Repub
licans t.> take an active interest in the
campaign and to go to the polls and
vote.

company's establishment last Tuesday.
The twenty-five or thirty young ladieS
of the class were instructed in matters
pertaining to economy, harmony of
color and line, good taste and other
elements which enter into the matter
of house furnishing. This is another
of the njanv practical phazes of
modern education. Every one of these
girls will in all probability be called

CALDWELL TEAM SHOWS
STRONG IN FIRST
GAME
The high school football eleven
showed up strong in their first game
with Ontario, clearly out-classing their
opponents at every stage of play.
During the first quarter the Caldwell
>oys played the most consistently of
uiv time throughout the gafrie, being
able to pierce the enemy's line at any
lime, in spite of the fact that On
ario's line greatly outweighed Cald
well's. It was unnecessary at any tim e
for the home team to open up any of
heir special devices for ground gain
ng, while Ontario was continually
forced to punt and use their most in
tricate forward passes to keep Cald
well out of reach of their goal. They
were especially successful with their
i assing during the second quarter, and
the inexperienced Caldwell players
didn't know how to break up their
plays. It was through this that On
tario got away for their touchdown,
'hough they failed to securer position
or kicking goal through the fumbling
of an easy catch on the kick-out.
Houghton's Advise Foils Passes.
At the end of th first half Coach
Houghton put in some well directed
advice, on the smashing of forward
asses, and front then on Ontario
,ailed to get within striking distance
f Caldwell's goal. They succeeded in
get tin gawav for one good gain on an
old time trick play but they were held
f o- down and Cook hooted the ball out
of danger.
Only two of Caldwell's players had
een in more than one quarter prev
ents to this game it is said, and con
idering this. Caldwell fans are de
cidedly optimistic >vith regards to
prospects for the season.
Oildwell Forfeits to Ontario.
On account of the fact Caldwell
used Connors who was ineligible at
the tim e of play—Caldwell authorities
have forfeited the game to Ontario.
Dugan Lewis who played left half
back for Caldwell was taken from the
game on account of a sore heel. Al
though he played half of the game
under the strain, Coach Houghton re
moved him in order to prevent dan
gerous developments in the injury,
putting Connors in his place. How
ever, Ontario had been notified sever
al days before the game Jthat this
might be necessary. On account of
the inexperience among Caldwell play
ers it was impossible to make any
other shift and permit the game to
continue. At the present Lewis is on
crutches.
Will Play Payette Saturday.
The Caldwell team will go to Pay
ette to play this coming Saturday.
Payette defeated Nampa a couple of
weeks ago, and a good snappy game
is anticipated.
