When you wera a little fellow at school
remember how proud and independent
you felt the few times you knew your les
son even loved your teacher?

study but it didn't take long, and you
were happier all day. Things haven't
changed much.
You are still in school--but ARE YOU
studying the lessons of your business life V
The probloms are pretty hard the hours
are long, but most teacher s are patient and
really want to help you. LEARN the les
son of SAVING its the A B C of BUSI
