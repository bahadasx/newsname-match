bound not to support the candi-
dacy of persons nominated by
any political party; it means that
the paper, and its editor, reserves
the right to support the candi
dacy of persons of any political
party whom it. and he, deems
worthy of support, regardless of
their political affiliations.
Being independent politically
we expect to vote a mixed ticket
at the election on the 7th of Nov
vember. Both of the two leading
parties have nominated men on
their tickets whom we deem
better qualified for the office they
seek than are any others seeking
those offices. For this reason,
and for the additional reason that
the day of hide-bound party alle
gience is a relic of the dark ages,
we shall vote and work for those
people whom we believe to be
best fitted for the places to which
they aspire. And in this, and
the next two issues of the paper,
we shall express ourselyes some
what explicitly as to why we
think certain candidates should
be elected. In voicing our sen
iments we shall confine ourselves
almost exclusively to county can
didates. Probably the most important
office in the county is that of
supervisor. For this office only
the best men should be selected;
men of strict integrity and sound
business judgment. Two such
men have been nominated by the
democrats of Navajo county, and
they are worthy of the support
of every voter in the county.
J. C. Paulse√º and John A.
Freeman are both pioneers of the
county; each has made a success
in his own business affairs and
each will use the same business
acumen in the conduct of county
affairs that he uses in the man
agement of his own affairs. We,
therefore, most heartily endorse
the candidacy of Messrs. Paulsell
and Freeman for the office of
county suparvisor.
Next in importance, possibly,
to the office of supervisor is that
of county attorney. Under the
laws of Arizona the county at
torney is the legal advisor of the
board of supervisors, and besides
he is the prosecutor in all crim
inal actions that are brought in
the courts of the county. A man
to acceptably fill this office should
be first of all a man well versed in
law ; moreovor, he . should be a
man of good character, and a
man in whom the public generally
has confidence.
A man who measures up to
these general qualifications, and
who possesses many other equally
important qualifications, is Thor
wald Larson, the democratic
nominee for county attorney.
Mr. Larson is an old resident of
the county and is well known to
all the voters; he is a lawyer of
exceptional ability and is splen
didly equipped to fill acceptably
the office to which he aspires,
He should receive the vote of
every democrat in the county,
and of many republicans.
The office of county treasurer
is one of great importance and
should be filled by a man of
strict integrity and sound busi
ness judgment. Not only should
the treasurer be honest and have
good business ability, but he
should be a man of large affairs
a man competent to grasp and
attend to big financial problems.
Such a man is J. W
Richards, !
democratic nominee for treasurer
of Navajo county.
Mr. Richards served two terms
as county treasurer before Ari
zona became a state. He would
have served longer had not the
statute forbidden that a county
treasurer should hold more than
two terms in succession. During
the two terms lie served the
county unaer the territorial
All government, Mr. Richards in
augerated many reforms in the
Mr. Richards
is now
finishing
; a two year term, and is seeking
reelection to a second term. The
record he has made during the
last two years in office certainly
entitles him to reelection, and
the big majority of voters in the
county will no doubt look at the
matter in this light
Lack of space in this issue
prevents further discussion of
county candidates at this time,
but the others will be discussed
in subsequent issues of the paper.
Lecture by Wool Expert
W. T. Rich, the Australian
wool expert, who is employed by
the American Range Wool Im
provement Association, delivered
a very interesting lecture in the
superior court room in Holbrook
last Saturing afternoon. Owing
to the bad condition of the roads,
occasined by recent heavy rains,
the wool growers ot the county
did not attend in so large num
bers as they would otherwise
have done. However, those who
listened to the lecture were well
paid and secured a lot of valu
able information.
Mr. Rich explained the system
of shearing the fleece, and grad
ing the wool, which is followed
in Australia, In that country
the wool growing industry is con
ducted along advanced, scientific
methods, while in America old
and crude methods are still in
use in parts of the country.
A Near Tragedy
Wednesday evening about
eight o'clock, as Mr. and Mrs.
C. R. Kelly were leaving their
home, a bullet struck Mrs. Kelly
on the side of the neck, making
a slight flesh wound. The bullet
was fired from a high power
rifle by John Jolly, who was
shooting through the side of his
house, across the street from the
Kelly home. Jolly had been
drinking hard for seyeral days
and had fired several shots be
fore the one that struck Mrs.
Kelly.
After assisting his wife into
their home Mr. Kelly summoned
Undersheriff Clemons and Jolly
was disarmed and placed in jail.
Thursday afternoon he was ar
raigned by County Attorney
Jordan before Judge Boyer and
was bound over to the superior
court under heavv bond.
Mrs. Kelly had a very narrow
escape from death for had the
bullet gone an inch one way it
would have killed her.
Schuster Store Dedicated
The mammoth new store build
ing of the A. & B. Schuster Co.,
was dedicated Monday night by
the giving of a grand free ball
therein. An immense crowd was
in attendence and for once the
social bars were thrown down
and eyerybody helped themselves
to a good time. Many were in
attendance from our neighboring
towns. F. W. Nelson, in a neatly
worded little speech, bade the
guests welcome, and on behalf
of the Schuster company, thanked
them kindly for past fovors and
good will and solicited a continu
ance of their patronage. The
Apache theater orchestra dis
coursed incomparably sweet mu
sic, and the dancers, many of
them at any rate, did not weary
of the gay fiesta until the small
nours of the morn came creeping
in. Hearty congratulations and
eood wishes are due the mem-
bers of the popular A.

Aviation at State Fair
To those who have watched
aviators soar into the clouds and
have wished for an opportunity
to do the same, the announce
ment that Harvey Crawford, the
Pacific coast aviator, will be at
the Arizona State Fair, Novem
ber 13 to 18th will be an agreea
ble surprise, A surprise because
this is the first trip Crawford
has made away from California
as he was instructing the Areo
Squadron of the state the last
mm' i
anvone neara or mm, ana an
agreeable surprise as he is the
builder and owner of a passenger
carrying machine that he will
bring with him on this trip.
The time has past when we
were contented to take our
thrills at second hand. To stand
on a fair grounds and watch the
aviator fly away. Now we wish
to experience the same sensa
tions that have become so com
mon to him. The easy rise, the
rush of air as the machine spirals
up and up. The heave of the
machine as the pilot "banks"
stiffly to the right and left. The
earthward swoop as we descend
and finally to enjoy the looks of
admiration from our less nervy
friends as we step from the ma
chine.
Crawford has been carrying
passengers on the coast for the
past two years and, be it said to
his credit, he has never had a
serious accident of any kind. He
is admitted to be the most care
ful aviator of the Aero Club of
America that is when he has a
passenger. Wnen up by nimseii
it is a different matter. Then he
is the worst "fool-flyer" in the
country. He loops the loop, flies
up-side-down, does the side slip
and jelly roll and every other
stunt that any other aviator has
ever attempted. These things he
will do at the Arizona State Fair
when he is not carying passen
gers. Little Tom's Place
Tomas Ortega, owner of the
building, has taken over the fur
niture and fixtures of the Little
Giant Cafe, and has reopened it
under a new name and new man
agement. The place will now be
known as "Little Tom's Place",
and it will be run as a first-class
and up-to-date restaurant. Both
regular meals and short orders
will be served, and everything
will be done to merit the patron
age of the public.
Why not try Little Tom's
Place for your next meal?
