PRESIDENT REMAINS CALM
PITTSBURG, Oct. 20. A
man giving the name of Rich
ard Cullen attempted to attack
President Wilson, while the
president with Bryan rode
through this city. Cullen, car
rying a black satchel, ran
alongside the automobile and
repeatedly attempted to jump
aboard.
The attack occurred in the
heart of the city, at Fifth ave
nue and Smithfield streets.
The crowd was very dense and
the automobiles were forced to
move slowly. A secret service
agent seized Cullen and threw
him off, but he immediately
tried again. Secret service
agents hurled the assailant
from the running board.
ASSAILANT IS CAPTURED
Cullen fled and ran half a
block before being overtaken
and overpowered. The police
found a long dagger and sever
al chisels in the satchel. Cul
len said he was dissatisfied with
Wilson's handling of European
affairs, but refused to admit he
intended to attack the presi
dent. After examining the prison
er, the police said he was in
sane. He is being held for in
vesuVtion. Cullen at first
spoke quietly, but later became
enraged and roundly denounc
ed the president's policies.
The satchel was unlocked
and fell open while Cullen was
fleeing, revealing weapons.
BRYAN MEETS WILSON.
Bryan met Wilson at the
train and shook hands with
him for the first time in
months. A tremendous crowd
demonstrated continuously
during the ride through the
streets and parks.
The president and Mrs. Wil
son, with democratic state
Chairman Guffey and two se
cret service men were in Wil
son's car. Wilson remained
calm during the struggle. Mrs.
Wilson shared his confidence.
The crowd seemed slow to
grasp the situation.
A loaded revolver fell to the ground i
during the scuffle. The police are
uncertain whether Cullen dropped tt.
Special Agent Deflore pummeled
Cullen beside the president's auto.
Fifty policemen clubbed the crowd
back. Cullen bled nt the mouth, and

heavy satchel.

DECLARES WILSON HAS BEEN
TRUE FRIEND OF SUFFRAGE
Pronouncing President Wilson as a
truer friend of the suffrage cause
than Candidate Hughes. Mrs. M. L.
T. Hidden of Portland, in an address
at the public library auditorium last
evening warmly rapped the alleged
suffragettes of the Golden Special
who are making a tour In behalf of
the republican presidential nominee.
In her talk Mrs. Hidden pointed out
the fact that when New Jersey voted
cn tne suffrage question many
month ago President Wilson made a
special trip to his old home state to
cast his ballot for the suffrage cause.
He also announced his position pub
licly so as to give the cause the bene.
fit of the White House endorsement.
Mr. Hughes at that time took on
stand whatever on the subqect
As to congressional action on suf
frage Mra Hidden asserted that the
national suffrage organization through
cm j n i
it' li
i r
.. .
its officers opposed any action In con
gress as the last session, as they con
sidered the time not ripe, and did not
wish the subject brought up there.
The so-called congressional union she
branded as a partisan organization
and not really representing the suf
frage move at all.
Aside from touching upon the suf
frage issue Mrs. Hidden spoke elo
quently of the great service President'
Wilson has rendered the country In
keeping it free from war while at the
same time upholding our internation
al rights and dignity. She character,
ized him as a great progressive and
president richly entitled to re-election.
Though the meeting last evenln?
was called upon short notice a good
audience, composed chiefly of women,
was In attendance. Much enthusiasm
was shown.
