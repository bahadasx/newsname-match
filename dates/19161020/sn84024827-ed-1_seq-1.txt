TAFI TALK AT
BALTIMORE
Taft Thinks Adamson Law
I and Treatment of Huerta
Grave Mistakes; Marshall
! Takes Pride in Both Issues.
(By Review Leased Wire)
BALTIMORE, Oct 19 Former
President Wm. H. Taft and Vice Pres
ident Thomas R. Marshall discussed
the issues of the presidential cam
paign here tonight at auditoriums on
ly a few blocks apart.
Referring to the passage of the 8
hour law, Mr. Taft declared that
"this government's surrender to force
i was the greatest humiliation to which
the peonle of the United States have
been subiected."
He said also that "the delay of the
administration ta bringing, the sharp
Issue w'th Germany (over the sinking
of the Lusitania) to a head had ex
posed this conntrv to a charee of
weakness and vacillation" , and sub
iected the nation to pdditional humil
iation in the sinking of other shins
and the drnwn'ng of Americans."
Taft Talks Intervention
Mr.. Taft said that the administra-
j tion's course "in actively intervening
o oust Huerta throws upon us the re
sponsibility for the anarchy that has
ensued." and brought about "a strong
possibility that we may have to Inter
vene in Mexico and tranquilize the
country in the interest of civilization"
Marshall For Fair Dealinq
Mr. Mprshall said the greatest rlory
of the Wilson administration wps that
"it has made in America an atmos
phere wherein men may breathe the
pure air of equity and fair dealing."
The enactment of the 8 hour law, he
said, was simply putting the opinion
of the people into a statute, "which
is the business of legislatures."
The vice president defended the ad
ministration's attitude toward the Eu
ropean belligerents and its Mexican
policy.
"The destiny of America." said Mr.
Marshall, "it to be patient and ex-
j haust all peaceable means for adjust
I ment of differences, rather than to
I rush to war. We are the very last
hope of the world, and all the political
I expediencies in the country should
not make the people trade peace for

"get the banners", a crowd of several

"There were all kinds of policemen

BIG RALLY SUCCESS

Make Short Addresses Be
fore Enthusiastic Meeting.
Drawing a comparison between the
present administration's treatment of
the Mexican problem, as it effects the
welfare of American lives and proper
ty in that country, and its course with
regard to American's rights on bel
ligerent ships in the European war
zone, and asking "why the difference
of treatment" Judge Joseph H. Kib
bey, candidate for the United States
Senate on the Republican ticket, made
his most telling argument at a big
rally at the Orpheum theatre last
evening.
Introduced by Eustace Dupen. who
acted as chairman of the meeting, as
one of the best known pioneers and
builders tof the territory of Arizona, a
man who had graced the bench of the
territory and who was the territory's
chief executive nnder Theodore Roose
velt, -Judge Kfbbey' reception was
unanimous.
In part the principal speaker de
voted attention to the accomplish
ments of the incumbent. Henry F.
Ashurst, and a candidate on the Demo
cratic ticket He called attention to
his own (Kibbey's) campaign expenses
and those of his opponent who, he
claimed, had used his franking privil
ege to send letters to the voters la
the state. He asked of the efficacy of
the laws, passed by Congress and
credited, in part to the Arizona senator
calling them, in the main, untried
acts of the national legislature.
Judge Kibbey was at his best in
discussing the Mexican problem. He
asked the crowd why the administra
tion should allow Americans and their
property to be despoiled In Mexico
and not. calling attention here to the
Lusitania incident, on European so.L
He declared that he believed, and If
elected would endeavor to secure,
ample and sufficient protection for an
American citizen wherever he might
be.
Of the planks in the Democratic,
national platform of 1912 Judge Kibbey
spoke briefly. He declared that the
principal ones had been either over
looked or Rrgotten.
In placing the election returns In
November Judge Kibbey expressed
himself as believing that the large
Independent vote in the country, which
includes Arizona, will return the Re
publican party to power at the polls.
Joe Prochaska. candidate for secre
tary of state on the Republican ticket,
was presented first Inasmuch as
Prochaska was a resident f Bisbee
for many years, and has been a visitor
here on ninny occasions since his resi
dence in Gila county, the Introduction
was superfluous. Prochaska made a
favorable impression on the crowd fbr
his presence and his ability to ex
press himself.
For state mine Inspector on the Re
publican ticket Norman McKenxle.
also of the Warren District spoke.
His good-natured humor, his very In
ability to make a 'speech' to bis wn
townspeople Instead of a brief talk
made him more friends than any ota
er thing could have done.
Judge Otis J. Baughn. RepuMica
nominee for associate Justice of the
supreme court of the state, spoke In
behalf of his twn candidacy at lenrth.
He declared. In part, that the office to
which he aspired, was In reality non
partisan, that it had been so declared
by the Democratic constitutional con
vention and bv the then party leader
hut had not been so since. Jndge
Ranchn made an anneal in pehslf cf
