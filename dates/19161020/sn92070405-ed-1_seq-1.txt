JONES BELIEVES
LAW WILL PASS
In an interview with a Western
Liberal representative this week A.
A. Jones, former Assistant Secretary
of the Interior and now Democratic
nominee for United State Senator
from New Mexico, expressed the be
lief that the 040 acre homestead bill
would bo passed upon .favorably by
the senate in December and within
two months time after its. enaction
would go into effect.
Mr. Jones stated that several sec- i
tions of tho new law were now under '
cómmittce advisement and that the Í
measures would be made as lenient
upon the homesteader as possible.
It is his belief that lands already
designated under tho 320 acre home
stead bill will be also open to entry 1
under the G40 law and the conditions

, of obtnining a section homestead will
be that such acreage is necessary m
order to make a living by tho grazing
"Lands in the shallow water bcltj
and land susceptible of irrigation in
the legal senso of the term will not
be open for the filing of section home
steads, is my belief," said Mr. Jones.
Hundreds of pcoplo in southern
Grant county will 4je interested in
this news. When tho section home
stead bill is passed it will mean that
practically all tho settlers In this sec
tion will be afforded a quantity of
land sufficient for them to make a
living upon by grazing cattle.
Mine Owners Here
D. F. Deifenbacher, a well
known hotel owner of Williams
port Pa.,andC.A.Baron,ownerof
a drug store at Shamokin, Pa.,

looking after mines in which they

are heavy stockholders in the
North Americah Copper Co.,
holding the Nellie Bly and Cobre
Negro groups in the Virginia
district. Messrs Deiffenbacher
and Baron will visit Douglas,
Arizona, before returning to
Pennsylvania.
