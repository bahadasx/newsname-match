, MORGAN. IN LONDON
J. P. Morgan, headf the Wall Street
wanking firm, sailed recently for Lon
don on the American liner new York-
As usual, the financier's name was kept
off- the paisenger list, and none of -the
ship's officers appeared to know he
was to make the trip until. Mr. Morgan
lame on board. He said he was going
abroad on business only, and that he
kaA fixed no date for his return,
i When asked, if he and Henry P.
Davison, a Morgan partner now In Kng
land, expected to arrange for another
$250,000,000 British loan Mr. Morgan
smiled and said Mr. Davison "had a
right" to be In London if he wished,
aa he was an American citixen.
When the recant loan for 100,000,
000, secured largely by bonds of neu
tral countries, was arranged, the sup
position was voiced in responsible bank
ing quarters that another of more than
double that amount would not be long
In appearing. In fact, bankers had
reason to believe that England and
France, aepsrately or jointly with their
Dies, would desire to borrow on a larce
wale in this country as soon as the
last loan had beea absorbed.
Mr. Morgan's departure has strength
wned the belief of the financial district
that Mr. Davison and A. M. Anderson
Head nf the firm's bond department,
were already at Work in London on a
new loan. Speculation aa to the nature
it would assume dealt - with the sup
position that the collateral behind it
vould be strongly fortified with securi
ties of American corporations, of which
the British Government has beea re
ported to have a vast supply at com
mand.
