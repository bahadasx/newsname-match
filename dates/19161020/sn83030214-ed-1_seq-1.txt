Berlin Announces Final Act in Military Career of Man
* Who Almost Took Paris?Rose from Ranks to
Field Marshal?Defied Army Traditions
Berlin, Oct. 19. -Field Marshal Ale
ander EL R. von Kiuck, who command
ed the right wing of the German army
ln its Bweep toward Paris in the fall
of 1914, has heen placed on the re
tired list at his own request. He had
never returned to the front since he
i was wounded by shrapnel fire in
March, 1915. while inspecting ad?
vanced positions. The field marshal
was seventy years old last Maj.
General von Kluck, whose troopa, the
First German Army, drove within
thirty milea of Paris before tha dis
aster of the Mame forced a retreat,
has been in the background of the
news since he piloted his soldiers to
safety. During the swift advance that
brought the sound of German guna to
Paris boulevards, the name of von
Kluck was as familiar as ia Hinden
burg's now.
Then came retreat, and the name of
von Kluck was sponged out. lt was
rumored that he had been relieved of
his command; another report had it
that he waa dead. Not until March,
1915, was he officially mentioned. A
brief dispatch aaid that ha had re?
ceived "a sllght shrapnel wound while
inspecting troops."
A dispatch from Amsterdam declared
that he waa wounded while exposing
himself rcckleaaly in flrat line trenches

interview with the Kaiser. It was said
that hia duties had been taken over
by Prince Fitel Friedrich.
Once more the general who had so
nearly reached the goal of German am
! bition and had conducted a akilful re
; treat receded into official gloom. For
j a moment he emerged, on May 20, 1916,
! his aeventieth birthday, when he ten
' dered his aervicea to his Emperor.
There was a message of congratuia
tion from his Emperor, but no answer
to the veterans offer was ever pub?

For more than fifty years von
Kluck has been a soldier of Germany.
He was born Kluck, the son of a gov?
ernment architect in Westphalia, and
he entered the service as a private
soldier in the 65th Infantry when he
waa nineteen yeara old. Fifty years
of militarism and elevation to the no
bility, which came in 1908, had little
effect on the soldier's inherent
democracy.
He fought in Austria in 1866 and
before Paris in 1870-T1. He was ad?
vanced rank by rank until he com
n.anded an army corps in 1906. For
years he was an instructor in mili?
tary schools, but always General von

Youngstown, Ohio. Oct. 19.?Charlea
E. Hughes roused a large erowd to
grest e .thusiaam to-night, when he
reiterated that he meant what he said
about the Lusitania snd denounced
Secretary Baker's comparison of the
Mexican revolutionista to Washing?
ton's soldiers. This attack on Mr.
Baker was the principal festure of
his speech.
"I never aupposed," declared Mr.
Hughes, in a huahed voice, "that the
day would come when a repreientative
of an Ameriean Administration would
aay that about the men who gave ns
our liberty.
"An Administration," he added,
"imbued with the spirit of true Amer?
icanism, would be incapable of the
comparison attributed to the Secre?
tary nf War. It must bring the blush
of shai. e to the cheek of every Amer?
iean that apnlogiea for the deplorable
record in Mexico should be made af?
ter this fashion.
"We want peaee. I am a man of

Wo cannot have peaee if we have a
decadence of Ameriean apirit. We
need an Administration that is not
compsring those who gave us our

liberties, to murderers and raping

which Will preserve the honor of the

The Baker utterance, as well aa the
.tatement of Secretary McAdoo of the
Treasurv Department, finding fanlt
with Mr. Hughes's Lusitania declsra
tion at Louisville, the candidate as
serted, shows in an illuminating way
this Administration's conception of the
value of words.
"It apparently seems lmpossible," he
said, "to this Administration that one

its d.fficulty. With it a threat of ac?

The banners which read "Women,

roughly handled. The President was
seated in an automobile a few hundred
feet away when the demonstration
started, but was not a witness to the
scene that fillowed.
Shouting "Shame!" "Disgrace!" and
"Get the banners!" a crowd of aeveral
hundred, aprinkled with women,
charged the banner holders. L'mbrel
las and canes were used in the destruc?

women were knocked down and nearly
all were roughly handled, especiaily
those who strove to retain their ban?

All Banners Seized
The excitement continued until all
the bsnnera had been seized. With dis
hevelled hair and soiled and torn cloth?

Compared to Parade
Members of the Congrcas'.onal L'nion
' compared the scene at the demonatra
tion with the suffrage parade in Wash

"The disgraceful attack upon the Buf
frage demonstration Is sirnilar to the
attack by Baoba upon the great suffrage
parade. Mr. Wilson is unfortunate that
he runa the risk of going out of office
! to the same tune by which he entered,"
, aaid Mrs. A. R. Colvin, Minnesota atate
' chairman af the Congressional Union.
Miss Alice Paul, national chsirman of
the Congressional I'nion, characteiized
it as an attack by Democrats.
"The violent attack hy Democrats
upon the demonstration shows the sert
ousness with which they take our iam
paign," she explained. "Evidently they
feel keenly the weakness of President
Wilson's autTrage position when they
resort to sueh violence to prevent his
hoatility to national woman a I'Tra^e
being revealed to the people of Chi?

CONVICT HUNT
ON JOHN D/S
PLACE; 1 SHOT
Leader of Sing Sing
Fugitives Hit as
His Gun Fails
SIX FLEE PRISON
IN AUTO TRUCK
Guard's Cap Aids Escape
?Rockefeller Bids Men
Help Searchers
The customary quletude of PoeantloO
Hills, the estate of John D. Rockefellei.
was broken last night by the tramp of
feet and revolver ahota, when a poaae
of prison guarda, reinforced by srnied
caretakers of the estate, heat oaar al?
most every foot of the walled-in aeraa
ln a hunt for Bia conricts who escape.
from Sing Sing prison yesterday in aa
auto truck.
Mr. Rockefeller, who returned a fuut
days ago from Cleveland, gara per
miasion for the man hunt to proeaad
when informed by the guards the-/
believed the men were ln hlding ao hia
property.
Goarda Track Fagt-tT.
The search hardly had Btarted when
a group of guarda aaw a man walking
along the Putnam Railroad tracka tow*
ard tho depot, about a quarter of *
mile from the Rockefeller home. They
recognized him by hle walk as **Tke"
Curtis, one of tha fugitives, who drotra
tho truck in whieh tho escapa waa
eiTeeted.
The guards ordered Curtis to halt, a.
the same time covering him with thelf
rifles and revolvera. The convict
whipped out a gun, but lt caught in hia
shirt. Aa he atruggled to releaaa i%
neveral ritlee cracked and two guards
blaz.ed away with revolvera. Curtte
crumpled up on tho tracks with a bul?
let in hta abdomen.
He w_s placed in an automobile and
rushed back to the priaon hospital,
while the guards, confident that. tha
other men lay concealed somewhere
in the bushea on the thickly wooded
P.ockefeller estate, continued their
s.*an-h almost all night. Flashlighta
gleamed and -ent out in the ahrubbery
like so many tirerlies as the hunt went
on.
Purchaees Ara C'lews
The prison authorities suapected tha
men would make for the Rockefeller es?
tate, as Ita _r<*at size haa affoiled a
tomporary retreat for other fugitives
in the past. The guards obtsined their
f.rst clew from the keeper of a groeery,
who said five men had entered his place
earlier in the evening and purchaaed
some cigarettes and choeola'.e. Curtis
was identified as one of the party.
Some e'.Karettes and two bars of choc?
olate were found in his pockets.
It is believed Curtia had been flent
by the others to find out when tha
next tram for New York would paaa,
and was on his way to tne station to
make inquiriea when the guards inter
cepted him.
Ail of those who eacaped were mem?
bers of the Mutual Welfare League,
founded by forrner Warden Thomas
Mot* Osborne, and the flight waa exe
with well eonceived preeision, as
if in protest at the ending of the Os
borne regime.
Taking advantage of a heavy rain,
the prisonera, ono clad in a long nib
ber rn:r.coat and a guard'a cap, four
aled in what appeared to be a
huge tool chest placed on the truck, and
the sixth, in prison uniform, acting as
driver, roda through the southern gate,
paase. through the streets of Ossining
..bandoning tha machine on tha
outakirta, waiked away in the direction
of Hnareliff.
Ip lo Welfare I.eague
The escap<-, the largeat in point of
numbers in mar.y years, occurred an
hour after Ca'.v:n Derrick, acting war?
den, had come to New York. Mr. Der?
rick, who took charge of the prison
only thia we.k, upon the resignation of
Mr. Oaborne, hurried back to the prison
?.mmoning the executive commit
to* af the Mutual Welfare League, told
aocapa was "up to them."
-? aaaa to be little doubt ln the
mind of the acting warden the men had
? inside and outaide.
< ontlag as it did so soon after tne
departare of Warden Osborne, whoso
was due to criticism direct
hln ty the sdministration be?
cause of a number of recent escapes, it
is believed the prisoners feared tha
abandonment of Oi-horne's reforma and
a r. turn to cond'.tiona sueh as exist at
Clinton ar.d Great Meadows.
A< -con aa he waa informed of the
raaoa James M. Carter, State Su?
perintendent of Prisons, immediately
ordered the suipension of the guard at
the gat.', who permitted the truck to
pass, and announced if it waa not found
the "privileges .njoyed by the lnmatea
were workar'.e" different "poiiciea"

Guard's Cap Dupea Sentry
lt was tflB minutes after 11 o'clock
in tho moinmg when Richard H'.land,
guard at the southern gate, ssw the
truck approach. On the driver*s seat
was a eonviet in the dull gray garb of
the prison. A large box reated behind
the unver'e seat, and back of thia
;t man in a rubber coat. A
guard'a cap, the visor dnpping water,
was pullea well down over his fsce,
apparently to shield him from tha
