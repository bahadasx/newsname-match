Admission About Weapons and Money
Given to Prisoners by Visitors Made
When Those Who Fled Yesterday
.Are Caught After All Night Hunt.
That there are at least seventy-five loaded revolvers in the posses
ion of convicts in Sjng Sing Prison and that the institution is fairly
stuffed with blackjacks and other weapons hidden in safe hiding places
wis confided to-day to prison officials by Maurice Curtiss, one of the six
who escaped yesterday and have been recaptured. Curtiss, was shot by
Keeper' Joseph Birdsall when he resisted and is in the prison hospital.
The prison is undergoing a thorough search this afternoon, but
Curtiss warned the officials they wouldn't find anything in the cells.
Tho revolvers, blackjack, dangers!
and other weapons, ho said, nro
towed away In workshlps ami store
houses and In npots known only to
the convicts who havo hunted them
out. Curtlss's statement created a
lot of apprehension anions tho prison
officials nnd keepers, who say tho
convicts havo been coddlod until they
bellovo they are within tfielr rlRhts
!n resisting by force any prison H'RU
Utlon that doesn't suit their Ulcus.
Curtiss said that under the. Os
borne rcglmo when visitors woro nd
mltted Indiscriminately and shown
' through tho prison by members of
iho Mutual Welfaro League without
' liny supervision, It was posslblo to
' smUKelo nlomst anything from a
"deck" of cocaine to a bass drum
Into Hlnir SIiik. Two friends brought
him tho revolver ho had In his jios
esstoii when ho escaped ystorday,
he said, lie had 7 In his pockot
when ho was caught and nil tho other
prisoners had money.
"Where did you get the money7"
he was asked.
"Tho visitors slip It to us when
they are going through," he replied,
ALL FUGITIVES CAUGHT AFTER
NIGHT HUNT.
All the escaped convicts wcro
caught In tho vicinity of John P.
Kockefeller'a estnto at Pocantlco
Hllla, whloh was the thcatro all night
of convict hunt staged with every
detail going to make up a thriller.
Prison keepers scouted through tho
woods and underbrush with their
trifles ready: policemen flashed electric
earchllghts here and thero; fllniT
convicts hid In rain-soaked shel
ters, cold and hungry nnd the
Rockefeller mansion was surrounded
' by a cordon of armed guards under
orders to shoot anybody approaching
without an explanation.
Ths Demon Hum played no small
part In the recapture of the convicts.
They tad hard luck at tho start in
that the auto truck broke down soon
after they left tho prison and thoy
had fUjured. on tho truck carrying
them almost Into New York City be.
fore an alarm could bo flashed ahead.
In aome way they got hold of soma
money and some clothos. All wont to
a saloon and purchased several quarts
of whiskey. Five of them decided to
stick togothcr. The sixth, Alfred
ijjtetnauer, on learning that his com
panions in flight were bound for Now
Tork, decided to strlko out for the
north. He was caught at 10 o'clock
to-day. sound aslcop In the woods

must bo choBon nt tho election thl
fall, to servo for ono year, tho Court
of Appeals decided to-day.
The question was raised by Joseph

Tbe.su nro tho questions that are
being gone Into thoroughly'hy tho
Housewives' Protective Association:
fAerc o "gentleman's agree

Is pasteurisation an actual neccs

proposition for higher-priced mllkt
How much is made In the by-products

Why should .Yew VorA: pan lc and

man Is paid Scf I
The Housewives' Protective Asso
ciation has entered tho fight for re
duced milk and will lie hacked by
Tho Evening World In a thorough
Investigation.
I heard tho testimony taken yestor
day at tho Inquiry now being con
ducted by Peputy Attorney Oencral
Lewis.
I heard the objection raised byrtef.
erro Pyckman, who wants to "get
along" with the investigation nnd Is
not going "to sit up hero and hear
even question." Any "notary puhllo
could do that," ho says.
So lis It rjolnn to object. In
fact, he has already strenuously
objected to allowing any coits of
operation to come Into this In
quiry, or the prico paid to the
farmor, or the capital of the com
panies, or the need of paiteur
ixatlon, or the prices charged by
the companies to consumers.
If you have anything to tell
him as to whether there It a
"combination," well and goodi
but otherwise there you are.
WOMEN ARE INTERESTED IN
ALL THESE POINTS.
And nil these things were discussed
yesterday by some members of the
Committee of Co-operation at lunch

of members of tho commltteo at this
meeting will bo presented In another

Suffice It to say the Housewives'
Protective Association will leave
no ttone unturned to show why
milk rates should not bt raised
by companies at' will and without
proper regulation.

FOR. THE LUSITANIA DEAD
Cartoon Prepared at Great Exr
pense Put on View and
Ordered Withdrawn.
THOUSANDS PRINTED.
Campaign Committee Planned
to Have Them in All Subway,
"L" and Surface Cars.
Another "shocker" In tho Itepub
Ilcan national campaign, similar to tho
moving picture reel of Mexican hor
rors "canned" last month, was or
dered withdrawn to-day by George
W. Perkins, who assumed arbitrary
control over llnance and publicity to
atop further blunders. '
A lnrgo cartoon representing Presi
dent Wilson garbed as an under
taker surrounded by the ghosts of
I.usitanla and Mexican victims hud
been prepared by aomo one In thn
national headquartern nnd approved
by Chairman WIllcox. Thousands
of copies had been printed and prepa
rations madu for cxtenslvo distribu
tion of this ghastly picture.
Tho Now York State oiinlzatlon
had been ordered by national head
quarters to adopt It and place It In
every subway, elevated and surfaca
tallway car. Managers of tho State
campaign protested that It was 111
advised but worn overridden and
obliged to spend largo sums of money
In printing and contracting for ad
vertising space.
Tho original drawing, as large ns
n map. was hung In Mr. Perklns'u of
flco to-day for Inspection nnd a meet
ing of tho executive managers sum
moned to view It. What they saw
was a background of shadowy fig
ures like ghosts, aomo floating In the
sea nnd others on Mexican dewirts.
In the centre foreground was Presi
dent Wilson In sombrn black garb of
nn undertaker, holding an open book
in his hand, marked "Kssay on Duty."
At his feet wan an American flag
with a soldier lying on It.
Tho picture was labelled "Our Am
erlcan dead In Mexico nnd on the
sen." The ghosts were quoted as cry
ing. "You didn't keep us out of war."
The effect was one of ghastly horror.
Chairman WIllcox nnd tho publicity
dopartencnt thought this picture would
mako the greatest hit of tha cam
paign. Herbert Parsons, who super
vises tho Now York rampnlgn,
thought well of It. They were for
scattering It everywhere, but some
ono with common sense culled atten
tion of Mr. Perkins to the certainty of
public denunciation that would come
from such a "shocker."
This phase of tho picture hniVnot
dawned on tho campaign managers
before, but they saw the point quickly.
Tho Republican managers turned un
dertakers thcniMjlves und Interred the
picture nlongMdu the Mexican inovla
reel on which thu commltUo cxpcnJ.-d

Mr. Perkins said the picture had been

being prepared.

Thn victory enabled the Itoumnnlans

named Richard Culliii, who Is said by members of his family arid the

which President Wilson was riding through tht business section t.

olT and he fell In the dense crowd.
Running after the automobile, he made another attempt to get Into
the tonneau. All the time he carried a satchel, which was unlocked and.
contained a knife with a blade five liTches long, several sharp chisel? and
a bottle of liquid, which has not bien analyzed. 1
As the Secret Service men pushed Cullcn from the car a second
time he was grasped by local detectives and Secret Service agents wna
had been following the President in another car. Cullen resisted anrst, .
and in the sniffle a loaded revolver fell on the street. .Witnesses dis-
