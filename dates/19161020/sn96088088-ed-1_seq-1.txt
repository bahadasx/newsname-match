CHAMBERLAIN DEFENDS PARTY
Asserts Opponents Have Criticized
And Offered Nothing.
United States Senator George E.
Chamberlain spoke to a crowded
house in Wie armory last night in de
fense of the Wilson administration
He asserted that the Hughes cum
paign had been: one 01 vindication
and personal abuse 'and that the Re
publican nominee had not offered one
constructive criticism. The senator
reviewed the acts of the Wilson, ad
ministration : the federal reserve act
the rural credits bill, the child labor
law, the road bill, the shipping bill,
Mie Alaska railroad measure, the
eight-hour law and the foreign policy
of Wilson's secretaries of state.
In introducing Mr. Chamberlain, E.
K. riasecki referred to the career
of the speaker of the evening and
mentioned his personal popularity.
That the speaker was personally re
membered during the evening was
shown by the applause that interrupt
ed1 bis speech several times. Mr.
Chamberlain 'a ability to remember
faces and-naines and anecdotes stood
him in good stead.

WILL REPRESENT POLK
L L. PATTERSON TO FURTHER
INTER COUNTY BRIDGE PLANS
Appointment Made Monday By Court
It Is Hoped To Have Negotiations
Completed By January 1.
To act for Polk county in all dis
cussions with the Manon eommty
court and Marion people, I. L. Patter
son haa been named as Polk repre
sentative by the county court. The
order was signed by the three mem
bers of the Polk county court Mon
day. Patterson is to act as the "go
between" of this county court and
Marion county. He will serve with
out pay and will not have power to
enter into contracts but his recom
mendations will be seriously consid
ered. It is believed that he will be
able to settle the differences between
the two county courts ae to the kind
of bridge and the place to erect the
proposed bridge.
The Marion county court wants the
new bridge placed in the same posi
tion as the present bridge but Polk
officials have objected because this
would necessitate the establishment
of a ferry while the bridge wss beine
constructed. The two courts have al
so differed on plans.
A record of all kinds of traffic
over the Marion-Polk county bridge
at Center street, for the month be
ginning September 10 at 6:30 a. m.,
to the same hour October 10, has been
compiled by the state highway de
partment.
The count was made by Watchmen
MeAdams, Donaldson and Parker,
who are stationed on the bridge.
The figures obtained give an idea of
the inconveniences which would be
caused by a suspension of traffic over
the structure.
Toe census shows that during the
thirty-day period 21,008 automobiles,
13,858 motorcycles, bicycles and pe
destrians, 10,307 horse-drawn ve
hicles and -923 head of stock crossed
the bridge. The daily average was
as follows: 700 automobiles, 464 mo
torcycles, bicycles and pedestrians,
343 horse-drawn vehicles and 31 head
of stock. The maximum automobile
traffic occurred on Portland day at
the state fair, when 1579 automobiles
crossed the bridge. During two hours
in the morning of that day the record
shows 300 automobiles having crossed
le river.
The heaviest horse drawn traffic oc
curred on Saturdays, the maximum
being on October 7, when 479 vehi
cles of that elass crossed. There are
two automobiles to every horse-drawn
vehicle crossing the bridge. Salem

FORMER RESIDENT HURT
DEL. ELLIS IN AUTO ACCIDENT
ATMEDFORD.
Has Foot Bones Dislocated and Arch
Bone Broken When Motorcycle
.. Strikes Car.
SAYS BUSINESS IMPROVES.
Farmers
Await Cars for Shipping
Their Crops.
In speaking of conditions in Dal
las to an Observer reporter yesterday,
a- vell-po9bed. business- man stated
that business was showing marked im
provement, and this winter would see
it better than for several years past
The only obstacle to still further
improvement, he remarked, "is the
car situation. The shortage has made
it necessary for the holding of agri
cultural products here that would
have gone out weeks ago, and because
the farmers cannot get their money
until crops are on the car, many have
been compelled to extend loans and
pay additional interest on borrowed
money. This condition, however, will
gradually be overcome as the railroad
companies are relieved of the heavy
fall rush of business," he remarked.
'Crops have been far better than in
the past several years and when all
if the money from them is put into
circulation it is bound to make a still
better feeling. Everybody is anxious
to sell and the stuff will go out just
as fast as the railroad company can
furnish the ears."
Del. Ellis, proprietor of the Oak
dale cash grocery at Medford, and a
pioneer resident of Dallas until about
a year ago, was seriously injured last
luesday afternoon ait 4 o'clock when
Eddie Jackson, a 16-year-old youth
living near Roxy Ann, drove his mo
torcycle into the ear belonging to and
Idriven by Dr. E. R. Seeley, in Med
ford, in which1 Ellis was riding.
The accident happened when the
Seeley auto came over the brow of a
hill on the Crater Lake road, about
a mile out of Medford. The boy was
seen riding his motorcycle toward the
party at a rate of 20 miles an hour
on the left hand side of the road, and
m order to avoid him Dr. Seeley held
the auto close to the embankment.
When within 50 yards of the auto
the motorcycle wavered and then sud
denly turned still further to the rid
er's left, dashing into the auto which
meanwhile had turned entirely out of
the road. Ellis was in the back of
the car, sitting on top of a load of
camp equipment with his foot hanging
over the side. When the motorcycle
struck Us foot it dislocated every
'bone in it and drove the arch bone
through the skin and shoe. Mr. Ellis
was immediately removed' to Medford
where his foot was operated upon.

WtELDON BLACK "NOT GUILTY'
posed to deal leniently with violators
of the prohibition law, but in Uie
instant case I feel that the interests
of society will be best subserved by
suspending sentence. Mr. Shriver ia
76 years of age, has served his country
well, has always borne a good repu
tation and no doubt committed an un
intentional violation of the Oregon
law regulating liquor consignments.
If I were to severely punish him un
der all these circumstances, I believe
that I would feel almost guilty of a
crime myself. Those who are dis
posed to violate this law should not,
however, infer from the action of the
court that there will be no sting to
penalties in proper eases."

Verdict Directed For Defendant
Charged With Manslaughter.
The jury in the case of the state
of Oregon vs. Weldon Black, charged
with manslaughter, returned a direct
ed verdiet Of "not guilty" Tuesday.

sustained a motion of Walter L.

leviation of gross, culpable or crimi
nal negligence. The violation of the
city traffic ordinance, the eourt said,
did not constitute criminal negligence.

Virginia Richmond Travels Ten Miles
Day.
Five miles, eaeh way, every day, is
the price Mr. and Mrs. Ed. Richmond
and little Miss Virginia Richmond of
Salt Creek are paying, so that Vir
ginia may attend school in Dallas.
Miss Virginia entered school Monday
and she will have traveled 1650 miles
before school is closed next year. As
either parent must accompany her
each day it means an added 1650
miles, or a total of 3300 miles the
Richmond family will spend before
next June. That is, provided Mr.
or Mrs. Richmond do not find it neees'
sary to travel back to their Salt
Creek home after bringing Virginia
in each morning. As they will prob
ably find it more economical of time
to do this, the grand total mileage
will undoubtedly exceed 3300 before
the 1916-1917 school year closes.
Set Speaker's Dates.

district attorney for Cuba under the
