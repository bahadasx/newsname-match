gated Cooper's Murderer Indicted
Finding that Herman Lake, super
intendent of the county garages had
used a county machine for his private
use after working houra and recom
mending that he be censured, the
grand Jury completed Its -work and
made Its report last Wednesday after
noon. II. W. Rice acted as foreman of
' the jury, which was In session for only
one day.
Another matter which the jury re.
commended that an Investigation be
made of was an alleged conspiracy
aga'nst Pedro Dautlsta, the Filipino
policeman. The officer was charged
with illicit conduct by some of his
countrymen. The jury after investig
ating the charge concluded that the
motive was spite and It called the at
tention of the court to Us decision.
No true bill was returned against
Kikusuke Fugiwara who was driving
a truck which ran over and killed
Joe Lopez, a slxteen-yenr old Spanish
boy, at Puunene on July 19th. The
boy was riding a mule to Puunene
after working hours. When the auto
truck approached the mule shied and
threw the boy under the wheels of the
machine. He was almost instantly
killed. Fugiwara was arrested and
charged with manslaughter, but the
Jury found that the death did not re
sult through any fault of the Japanese.
An indictment was returned against
Francis B. White, who claims to be an
American of Dutch descent. He is
charged with passing forged writing
and was arrested only last Friday,
after some of the worthless checks
which he Is alleged to have cashed
were turned over to the sheriff's force.
White has had rather an odd career
since coming here from Washington,
the later part of July. He came here
to work on the smokestack of the
Puunene mill and has had several
other positions. He made It a point
to make the acquaintances of the
Catholio priests,' especially ' Father
Justinan, whom he is said to have
ictlmlzed. One of the false claims
which he is said to have made is that
he was a federal inspector of hulls
and boilers. The amount of the checks
which White is accused of pssing Is
small.
Other indictments were returned as
follows: John Ginza, confessed mur
der of George Cooper, murder in the
first degree; Jul'o Santos, assault
with a deadly weapon; Antone Garcia,
assault with a deadly weapon, and
Frank Mendez, having sexual Inter
course with a girl under fifteen years
of age.
Santos and Garcia are the two
Spandiards who had a fight In Happy
Valley recently over a quarrel of their
children. They used a knife and a
r-r nn.1 both were so badly injured
that they had to be given treatment
at the hospital for several weeks.
The report of the grand jury was as
follows:
"We have Investigate what seems to
be a conspiracy against Police Officer
Pedro Bautista; that the Grand Jurors
consider a conspiracy of this kind
against an officer of the law a very
serious matter and wish particularly
to call the attention of the Court to
the same.
"We also And that in the case of one
Herman Lake, that he used an auto
mobile which was county property, for
his own use after business hours. We
believe that he should be severely
reprimanded and the attention of the
Board of Supervisors called to this
particular case, and we sincerely hope
that some action may be taken in this
matter.
''In the case of the Territory of Ha
'waU vs. Kikusuke Fugiwara, charged
with manslaughter, the grand jury
found no true bills.

H. W. RICE, Foreman."
Grand Hotel To
Give Fair Banquet
Ladies are to attend the "booster"
fair banquet on November 9th, as a
, result of a decision reached at a meet
ing of the executive committee of the
county show held yesterday afternoon.
The committee decided to give the
banquet in the new Grand Hotel din
ing room, which is expected to be
completed by that date.
A fine program of speeches and
music, and other forms of entertain
ment, is being arranged for the ban
quet. The Mary Hoffman orchestrfi
has offered to donate the music and a
number of Maui's best speakers will
make short talks on the fair and its
object.
It is the hope of the fair committee
that this will be the final means need
ed to excite general interest in the big
county show. Invitations to the dinner
are to be sent all over the county and
will be issued in a few days.
The dinner will not only be a "boos
lng" one for the fair, but will also
jnark the openning of Wailuku's
newest hotel.
Humorist's Cousin
Now Fishing Fan
Miss Mildred Leo Clemens Wins New
Distinction To Make Halea
kala Trip Alone If She Has To
Greatly pleased with having won the
distinction of being the first white
woman or girl to participate in game
fishing in Maalae Bay, off Kehei, Miss
Mildred Leo Clemens of Berkeley,
Cal., cousin of Mark Twain, the writer,
declares she enjoys Maul as much as
the rest of the islands, which she has
been visiting during the last few
weeks.
What pleases Miss Clemens most
Is that she was fortunate enough to
hook a b'.g flsh while out with a party
of sportsmen yesterday. There were
nine persons in the Ashing party,
who. besides the local residents, con
sisted of Newton Foster of Boston,
Mass., A. F. Lokin of Minneapolis,
Minn., and A. Gearhart of Chicago,
111.
Miss Clemens expects to remain on
Maul until next week, during which
she w'll ascend Haleakala and make
the trip to liana by horseback over
the Nahikl ditch trail. She is anxious
to meet a party which intends to make
the trip, so she may accompany them,
but if not so fortunate she does not
intend to give up the trip.
When miestloned as to with whom
she expected to go on the junket, she
replied: I do not know yet. But one
th'ng Is certain. I am going to make
that trip even if I have to go alone."
Any listner would have been Impress,
ed with her evident sincerity, by the
emphasis she placed on the last state
ment. It was jokingly intimated that she
should bo asked how she liked Maui.
"Well you know I went fishing yester.
day and caught a big one," she laugh
ingly answered.
Lahaina Wharf Is
Political Subject
Governor Clears Raymond Of Charge
Of Opposing New Landing Survey

Open Letter To Weinzheimer
That the chairman of the harbor
board has been giving much study to
finding a method to improve the land
ing facilities at Lahaina and that the
commission will soon visit that place
to make a thorough Investigation cf
the subject is the information contain
ed in a letter which Governor L. E.
Pinkham has written to Dr. J. H, Ray
mond.
The governor adds, that "it is hop
ed a practical plan can be presented
to the coming legislature and Lahaina
be maintained in its past and present
importance, without the landing dang
ers that have always existed."
The governor's letter was written to
Dr. Raymond as the result of a re
quest that the territorial executive In
form the people of Maui as to his posi.
tion regarding the proposed Mala
wharf, near Lahaina. This, the Maul
doctor says was after L. W. Weinz
heimer had accused him of having
blocked the plan for the bullcfing of a
wharf at Lahaina, for which an ap
propriation, was made at the 1913
legislature.
Dr. Denies Charge
The doctor denied the accusation
and declared that he cou'd prove the
plantation manager was mistaken by
the governor. The doctor then wrote
to the governor aski,ng that his stand
on the Lahaina wharf question be
made clear. To this request the gov
ernor complied, writing a letter for
publication in the local press. The
governor's letter is- given below:

KARL AHNALL IS
WOUNDED IN FRANCE
Former Wailuku Station Agent Writes Letter To
Maui Friends Describing Exper
ience With Allies
Soldier-like, seemingly more Inclined
to tell of the kind treatment he is
receiving and to extol the beaut'es
of Old England in September than to
describe the manner of the fighting' in
the trenches in France, Karl Ahnall,
former station agent in Wailuku and
Kahulul, has written a rather lengthy
letter to his Maul friends, while he is
recovering from a bomb wound, which
he received in the fighting around
Poziere, France.
Ahnall was on Maui for a number of
years preceding 1911, after which he
went to Broome, Australia, to engage
in pearl fishing. He is remembered
here by nearly a'.l the Central Maul
residents. Although he is a native of
Sweeden, the cause of the Allies
and a desire for adventure appealed so
strongly to him that he enlisted in
February of 1915.
Since then he has had a varied ex
perience, having been with the Brit
ish troops in the Dardanelles, Egypt
and France. To have seen service in
the throe war zones is an unusual one
for any regiment, but such has been
the fortune or fate of theAustralian
battalion with which he enlisted.
Is Promoted
Following the fighting at Gallipoli,
Ahnall was made a sergeant major.
Just why be won this distinction, al
though he was of another nationality
than his fighting comrades, he does
not state in his letter. Interestingly
naive, is his statement that he did not
believe that he could be wounded, but
adds: "Here I am wounded, but not a
bit worse off, luckily." His after com
ments on the subject seems to imply
that he thinks the wound will do him
good, and not cause him to show over
confidence again In the future.
Sergeant Ahnall,. writing of his
wound, says: "It was in trying to take
the lines behind (Poziere) at a latter
date that I got bombed, kicked and
hit through shoulders and chest by
something that feit like a red hot
iron." Then he adds: "Nothing ser
ious." Food And Sunshine, Heaven -
His description of the fighting in
taking Poziere Is brief but highly in
teresting. He says: "It did not take us
long to get Poziere. It was a glor
ious fight in the preliminaries, and as
goon as we reached the trenches and

Popular Attorney
Making Maui Visit
James Coke, the Honolulu attorney
who is so well known on Maui on ac
count of his previous long residence
here, is on this island, combining
business and pleasure. He is accom
panied by Mrs. Coke and they arrived
here last Sunday, going to the Ulu
palakua ranch the following day,
where they spent several days with
Dr. Raymond.
The attorney expected and did some
bird hunting while on the ranch, but
he refuses to tell whether with any
success or not, until he learns if a
hunting license was issued to him per
his request made by mail last Monday.
Jokingly, the county officials have
refused to tell him whether the
license was issued, until he informs
them as to the numbers of birds he
shot. At present the controversy is
at a deadlock, the attorney maintain
ing up to the present that he was un
successful on his hunt for birds.
Coke will remain here until some
time next week, taking advantage of
the coming session of the court to
clear up a number of old cases.
The attorney, who is counsel for the
public utilities commission, says it is
doubtful when that body will be able
to end the nter-Island freight rate investigation.
started to prod "Fritz" with our bay
onetes, the majority surrendered
crying "Mercy Kamerad". Some 1
admit, were a bit rough and worthy
of our respect. For their machine
gunners I have only praise. They
generally stuck to their guns vicious,
rattling things." '
But Sergeant Ahnall's description of
all the fighting he has seen is limited
to a few words. He assumes that "you
know all about the fighting from the
nev spapers." It is in describing the
beauty of France and England, and
the deMght of swimming in Egypt, or
the weariness, sickness and discour
agement of the Gallipoli campaign, or
the dreadful monotony of trench
fighting that he grows at all volum
inous. Though he does not say so In so
many words, what to him and the
other soldiers is heavenly peace and
paradise is a place where the food is
good, the trees are green and the
people are kind, as is so apparent in
paragraph after paragraph of the first
part of his letter.
Sergeant Ahnall's letter was writ
ten under date of September 7, from
Sheffield, England. He gives his ad
dress as C. Co., 28th Australian Batta
lion; A. I. F France. His letter is
given below in full:
Did Not Like Gallipoli
. My letter of the 3rd inst. was as
usual very short. I told you there a
little about Gal'lpoll. I was in a way
glad to leave, as I did not feel too well
the last few weeks. So many broke
down from dysentery, water was often
scarce and the bill of fare monotonous,
altho we tried to improve it with all
kinds of concoctions.
.In GalHpoM I was made a sergeant
major, going up in the world, as you
see and not always with the help of
explosives. Christmas I spent on a
dismal Island of Greece where we
managed to have a Christmas dinner,
but I am sorry to say without "Tur
key".
Stationed On Desert
It was a relief to return to the Nile
Valley and feast ones eyes again on
green country after all the bleak and
grey of the Dardanelles. But worse
luck. This time we were stationed
right out in the desert, miles away
(Continued on Page Six.)
County Will Build
Big Lahaina Sewer
The Maul supervisors have informed
the public works department that the
county would construct a big storm
sewer across the main street in Laha
ina leading from the Lahaina swamp
to the sea. It is probable that the
public works department will call for
bids in a short time, states a Honolulu
report.
About $34,000 is available for fill
ing and draining the swamp, and plans
and specifications are ready. The de
partment has only been waiting dur
ing the last week to hear from the
supervisors to see if they are willing
to construct the sewer.
LANAI OUTING GREATLY
ENJOYED BY WAILUKUANS
A very pleasant outing was enjoy
ed last Sunday on Lanai by a number
of Wa'luku persons, the party having
the fortune to see an unusual sight for
waters about these islands, It Is said,
while crossing to the little Island from
1-ahaina.
Nearing Lanal, the party noticed a
lot of big sea birds swooping down
frequently into the water. As the
launch got nearer, it was seen that the
birds were catching mullet from a big
school which was passing and
in the middle of the thousands of flsh
there was a monster shark.
Before going to Lanai the party
spent Saturday afternoon and evening
'n Lahaina, watching the sailors and
ships of the naval fleet which was
then there.
Those In the party were as follows:
Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Fernandez, Mr. and
Mrs. A. Enos, Mr. and Mrs. A. Garcia,
Mr. and Mrs.. J. Garcia, Miss Dorena
Oschner, Miss M. Rodrigues, J. M.
Ambrose, Miss Eva Reis, and Mrs.
C. Cravalho.
Due to the illness of three teachers
there has been no school In three of
the rooms of the Wailuku public
school during the past week. The
three teachers who were confined to
their homes were Mrs. George Weight,
Mrs. W. F. Crockett and Mrs. J. Wilm.
ington. Mrs. W. F. Crockett has suf
ficiently recovered so she can resume
her duties.
Who Knows Mrs.
Samuel Halsey?
New York City Woman Is Desirous Of
Locating Wailuku Relative
After Thirty Years
Mrs. Elizabeth Halsey Werrtworth
of New York City is desirous of locat
ing a Mrs. Lahappa Halsey, wife of
Samuel Halsey, who settled in Wailu
ku many years ago and who Is sup
posed to have died about thirty years
ago. This is the information contain
ed in a letter which has been received
by Postmaster Costa from the New
York inquirer.
A letter was enclosed which was ad
dressed to Mrs. Lahapapa Halsey and
the postmaster was asked to deliver
It if possible, or inform Mrs. Werrt
worth in New York of any information
he might have or gain. The writer
states that the wife of Sam Halsey
was much younger than he and that
members of the family in the states
were wondering if she were still liv
ing. The letter continues: "I cannot tell
you her family name or anything
about her except that she was the
wife of Sam Halsey." The letter
closes with the request that the en
closed letter be returned to the writ
er, if Mrs. Halsey cannot be located.
Postmaster Costa is desirous of loc
ating Mrs. Halsey, or some of her
relatives, if such can be done. He
asks that if any of the old timers re
member Halsey or his wife that they
so inform him.
Maui Politicians
Are Frightened
Rumor Starts That Governor Has
Failed To Issue Election Procla
mationRapid Exchange Of Wire:
Iesses Brings Information Fear
Unfounded
Political circles were strred to the
depths last Wednesday when the ru
mor became general that Governor
L. E. Pinkham, or Secretary Thayer,
had failed to issue a proclamation for
the general election on November 7th,
forty days before that date, as is re.
quired by law. Many of them thought
that a legal election could not be held
if this was true, and all loked gloomily
back on the pre-election campaigning
they had made, and incidentally, all
the election expense which they had
been put to so far.
The rumor arose because the elec
tion officials had not been sent a copy
of the proclamation, and because it
had not been posted here, as is cust
omary. When the supposed over
sight was first discovered, wirelesi
messages were rushed off to Honolu
lu. Harry Mossman was among those
who wrote to the Governor regarding
the matter. Late Thursday afternoon
he received a message from the ter
ritorial executive, which set at rest
the worries of the politicians. The
message read:
"Your fears unfounded. Election
proclamation issued September 26 and
published In the New Freedom and
the Aloha Aina September 30th."
Now the politicians do not know
whether the joke is on them or the
two publications, in which no one bad
read the proclamation.
The fear and excitement of the
Maui politicians was some what exag
gerated, because they remembered the
difficulty which arose in the spring of
1915, preceding that election. The
supervisors at that time failed to issue
a county election call, and It was
necessary to get the legislature, which
was in session, to pass a special act
to permit of a. valid election being
held.

Coming To Fair
W. R. Farrington Writes That Organ
izations Are Working On General
Scheme For Representation At
Maui County Show
The Honolulu Ad Club, the Hono
lulu Chamber of Commerce, the Rot
ary Club, Pan-Pacific Club and the
Promotion Committee are working on
a general scheme for representation at
the Maul County Fair, according to
information which comes to Wailuku
from W. R. Farrington, prime mover
in the enterprises of the more import
ant Honolulu organizations. Farring
ton is to be one of the speakers at
the fair and has selected as his topic,
"The Island Press."
News that the commercial and civic
organizations of the Island capital
were considering representation at the
county fair was received here with
pleasure and enthusiasm, for if thes
bodies decide to take part the attend
ance from Honolulu will be trebled, to
what it ordinarily would, it is thought.
The Honolulu newspaper man writes
that he has just waked up to the fact
that the first day of the Maui County
Fair is to be Thanksgiving Day, which
means, he adds, that he will have to
come to Wailuku to eat his turkey.
While he intimates that he does not
Just see how the fair will be able to
attract a crowd on the "Home Holiday,"
he makes evident that he does not
doubt Maui's ability to do so.
Farrington states that the Interest
of the Honolulu organizations Is prim
arily for the purpose of showing that
Honolulu men are In accord with any
enterprise that is Intended to promote
the development of the island com
munities and "Increase the spirit of
co-operation among men and institu
tions." The Star-Bulletin expects to
have an exhibit at the lair, he states
In the letter. A portion of Farrington's
letter is given below:
"I had assumed all the while that
the fair would fall on the week before
Thanksgiving. However, I will keep
my appointment and be with you. I
expect to Bee Mr. Cameron when he is
in town sometime this week.andmake
arrangements for an exhibit for the
Star-Bulletin.
"A plan is on foot for proper rep.
resentation of the Ad Club, Chamber
of Commerce, Rotary, Pan-Pacific Club
and Promotion Committee in one gen
eral scheme. This is to show that we
are with any enterprise that is intend
ed to promote the development of our
Island communities, and increase the
spirit of co-operation among men and
institutions."
Dr. Raymond Has
Pleasant Surprise
When the official returns were re
ceived from Kalaupapa, the Molokal
settlement precinct, late last Friday
afternoon, Dr. J. H. Raymond, the
Democratic candidate for election
from this island, was greatly pleased to
learn that he had received many more
votes there than was first reported.
The first report, which was brought
to Maui by sampan the day after the
election, gave him only fifty-eight
votes in the settlement. The official
returns showed that he got a total of
122 votes. This increased his total
for the whole island to 943 votes,
which was Just about the amount it
was anticipated he would receive.
The unofficial returns only gave him
879 votes and a lead of only sixty-six
votes over George P. Cooke. The of
ficial results of the primary election
now shows that he led Cooke by 150
votes.
As a result of the primary vote Dr.
Raymond is more confident than ever
that he will be the second choice of
the voters as Maul senator at the
November election.
