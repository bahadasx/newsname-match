Theodore Roosevelt's visit In Lou-
f"Jvtllf lust night wns nn unlntcrrupt-
K ovation from the hour of his ar
rival until that or his departure. The
oombluod elements of jealous nature,
United In a demonstration of Inclc-
anenry, could not chill 'thu ardor of
his welcome. Dank rain fell and clfllP
vlttds blew unheeded as assembled
multitudes paid homage of affection
to tnelr distinguished guest.
His reception was wonderful n
tremendous testimonial of, devotion.
More than that, It was "bully." Ted
dy nald so, himself, as ho burst into
Knccato exclamations of unchecked
pleasure at the welcome extended
Jilm.
The failure of President Wilson to
.protect or avenge the lives of Ameri
can citizens in Mexico or abroad was
hold up for the scorn of all red-blood-d
Kentuckiana by Col. Theodore
Jlooseveit in a vigorous address at
Phoenix Hill Park last night.
The vacillating timidity which has
marked the Administration's deal
dings with all foreign Powers, except
tho helpless little republic of Haiti,
and to which the great loss of Amer
ican lives and property Is attributa
ble, was the chief subject of Col.
Roosevelt's address.
Other subjects discussed by tho
Colonel included tho, tariff and the
Adatuson bill. In talking of tho far
mer ho precipitated a tumult of ap
plause by calling attention to the
fact that the present chairman of
tho Democratic County Campaign
Committee also was chairman of the
Mayor's Relief Committee which
mado a. futile attempt to copo with
conditions of unemployment in Lou
isville following tho passage of the.
Democratic tariff bill. His speech
upon the Adamson bill followed the
lines of his previous utterances on
this subject.
Auditorium Is Killed.
Col. Roosevelt was heard by an nu
dllfcce which tilled the Phoenix Hill
auditorium to overflowing. Thous
ands were unable to find either scats
or standing room in tho hall. Thous
ands of others, after taking part In
tbo great demonstration, gave up na
unless tho attempt to enter tho park
jit all. Within the auditorium tho
crowd was packed so closely that the
movement of un Individual caused a
wavo of motion to pass thru those ono ciSOi however, always finds a

This big nudienco and the over-1

Almost every sentence was followed
by an outburst and at times tho hall

Is genuine hospitality. Men are

working out plans to carry Kentucky
for Hughes and Fairbanks November
7th.
You decide to look around over
your property and looking into oue of
' the other rooms you aro dumfound

sounds like a country saw mill. Girls,
good looking ones too, are Hitting
here and there tho busiest little
things you ever saw. There "are
many things to do and each one has
a specialty.
An Ohio countaln Is especially nt

You pass on down the hall to tho en

Rush to Scene With Health Officer
Where n Careful Investigation
I.s Made.
Wltllo coon hunting In Muddy bot
toms, near Hartford, Friday night
two local men detected some very
lino hair scattered over tho ground,
and upon Investigation were startled
to find what they belloved to be hu
man bones wrapped In some old
clothes. They concluded at once that
there had been a murder and that
somo prowling animal had dug up
tho remains of the victim.
It was not ono of those black, sul
try, nights of which Shakespearo was
so fond of telling. On the contrary
the moon was shining very brightly
and tho air was fresh but the
thoughts of unearthing such a terri
ble tragedy was upsetting to tho
nerves of tho hunters. The long
white hair was undoubtedly that of
an infant. Tho fact that tho body
had been wrapped in the old clothes
and then buried indicated that the
murderer had worked with coolness
and deliberation. Tho thoughts of
tho silent two wero ns ono this
chlldklllor must bo brought to jus
tice; this willful murder must be
avenged.
In low tones a short consultation
was held and tho hunters mado their
way silently to Hartford vvhero an
officer was notified of tho discovery
that 01190 mado public, so -they be
lieved, would Btart thousands of
tongues to wagging. It was thought
beat to await tho coming of day to
mako further Investigations. Two
officers and tho two hunters departed Judogo W. II, Dames to. tho offect
early tho following day for Muddy that Mr. Johnson did uso substnn

Hartford, Ky., Oct. 19, 191G.
To the Democratic voters of the
Fourth Congreslonal District:
In my article of September 18th,
'printed in The Hartford Republican
September 22, 1916, I said:
"Further, I have on a slip of paper
In my vest pocket the, names of eight
good Democrats, who heard Mr.
Johnson say when he was down here
in the summer, 'I have a potato patch
d n well cultivated and you fellows
down hero can go to h 1 so far as
I am concerned.' "
The Herald of yesterday says:
"The Hartford Republican, in Its
labored effort to create political
predjudice agahist Congressman
Johnson, continues to quote somo lan
guage attributed tp Mr. Johnson by
Mr. J. H. Williams. It says max ba
wo want to deny this. Mr. Williams
was called on for tho names of tho
eight Democrats whom ho claims
hoard tho statement made and wo
havo Interviewed five of the num
bor to-wlt: A. C. Porter, Rowan
Holbrook, Ozua Shultz, John D.
Wilson and J. C. Her, and each one
of theso say that Mr. Johnson mado
uso of no such lnnguago In tliolr
presence ns that quoted by Mr.
Williams In Tho Hartford Repub
lican. If any ono doubts this, we re
fer him to uny of tho abovo named
gentlemen."
In self-uu,icnsc, I want to say that
1 1 havo a written statement from
mon street talk for several days bo
foro I talked to Judge Dames about
tho matter.
Now, Mr. Herald Editor, A. C. Por
ter, Ozna Shults, Rowan Hplbrook,
J. C. Her, John D. Wilson, or any
0110 olso who doubts that I have the
abovo statement, If you will come to
my drug iHoro I will show It to you.
Further, tho Herald says Mr
Johnson knows of $500,000 moro he
1b going to put back la the Treasury,
but I call your attontlon to the fact
that he, nor the Herald haVever said
what ho was golug to do about put-
ting back tho $1,327,699.50 used out
of the Treasury, (not to buy coal,
food, and such llko, as he would have
you think) but to complete, build ad
ditions to, put in elevators, etc., in
the great Providence Hospital, over
which the U. S. Government has no
control. Yours .truly,
JAMES II. WILLIAMS.

BRITAIN NOT TO
ACT IN (1-53 CASE
VISCOUNT GREY SAYS U. 8. AN
NOUNCEMENT WILL DE
AWAITED.
iftndon-, Oct. 17. The British
government will iot maVe any offi
cial representation to the United
States' concerning the German sub
marine U-53 pending an announce
ment of Its attitude by the American
Government said Viscount Grey, Sec
retary of State tot Foreign Affairs
in the House, of Lords today.
The question concerning tho Ger
man submarine raid In American wa
ters was raised by Baron Charles
Dersesford, former. commander of the
British home fleet; Earl Grey, for
mer -Governor General of Canada,
and others. Baron Beresford asked
KvKether British cruisers were remov
ed from American waters owing to
American objections and if so what
steps tho Government proposed for
the protection of British vessels. Ho
criticized the submarine reply as at
least curt and said the American
Ideas of neutrality were curious.
Earl Grey wanted an assurance
that the report was untrue that
American commanders of destroyers
had acceded to tho request of the
German submarine commander to
clear out of tho way and give him
room to blow up ships.
SIXTEEN COLLEGES

Army.
Washington, Oct. 18. Official au
thorization for the training In mill
try science of students in sixteen of
tho country's leading universities and
colleges has been given by the War
.Department to executive officers of
the Institutions nt a conference be
tween them and ranking department
officials.
Tho purpose of the'eonference was

law. It has been estimated that a
corps of 50,000 reserve officers will
bo necessary to establish an adequate
military forco, should tho United
States become Involved In war with
a first-class world Power.
Tho curriculum will bo drafted to
cover such subjects as aro known to
Junior officers nnd will exempt grad
uates of such institutions from tho
necessity of tnklng the regular army
examination In order to obtain com
missions as reservo officers. It will
bo mado effective when completed, by
a genoral order Issued by tho Secre
tary of War. , Many other education

"BOYS ALL WELL
W THE BORDER"
SAYS CAPTAIN SHOWN ON Afc
RIVAL IN ILVRTFORD WED- .'
NESDAY.
MAKE GOOD ON HIKE
Kentucky Brigade Makes Highest
Rating on Marcli of Over Hun
dred Miles.
Tanned by the burning sun of .
Texas and hardened by the life of
soldier on the border Captain C. B.
Shown, of H Company, Kentucky Na
tional Guard, blew into Hartford
Wednesday night. He had been on
tho road since Monday and had Villa
been in theso parts he would un
doubtedly been taken by surprise-tor
none here knew of the Captain's com
ing. He was immediately surround
ed by relatives and friend of the
boys on the border and questions
were fired Into him with the rapidity
of a modern machine gun.
"The boys are all well on tho bor
der," was about all the visiting Sol
dier had to say for he could hardly
wait to see the home folks and get
a whiff of the aroma of Kentucky
ham and other home dishes. Tcxaa
seems to be agreeing with Capt.
Shown. He has taken on about
twenty pounds -in weight since going"
there and if all the boys are In as
good condition the folks back home
need not worry. The commander of
H'pp'mpany will be here for twenty
days a'nd wljl Ihen return to hl3 com
mand. That Kentucky troops are making
good In the service Is evidenced by
the fact that they made the highest
grade on the hike from El Paso to
Las Cruces and return, a'dfstahce ot
over one hundred miles. Company
H stood the hike well and made an
excellent showing.
Several members of the Hartford
company have been transferred to
various other departments. Several
have gonq, to the machlno gun com- v
panles while others have been trans
ferred to the commissary depart
ment. There are now about thirty
nine left to uphold the reputation of
the company. Captain Shown is la
sole command as Lieut. Darnett is tu
the recruiting service at Ft. Thomas
while Liedt. sborne is absent on
leave.
Only guesses can bo made as to
how long the Kentucky troops will
be on duty. Some think the boys
will be recalled about the first of No
vember while others seem to think
they will be out until spring. It
seems improbable that they will be
for many weeks at the shortest. Win
ter clothing has been Issued nnd the
camp Is being prepared for winter.
