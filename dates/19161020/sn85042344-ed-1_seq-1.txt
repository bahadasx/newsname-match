Py Q ISO RG 13 VON L. MEYER,
'(Secretary of the Navy In the Taft
Administration.)
Dl'RINU the campaign in -Maine,
which has Just taken place, the
secretary of the navy, Mr. Daniels, lias
been, according to his ciiKtoin, mak
ing from the stump misleading anil
evasive statements in answer to Mr.
Gardner's queries, lie also has taken
credit for actions to which lie has no
claim.
For instance, In his speech of Au
gust 2!i at Milbridge, Maine, ho said:
"Mr. Gardner, and, thanks to his
propaganda, all the world, knows that
owing to Secretary .Meyer's parsi
mony and lack of conception of the
navy, the elementary target practice
Was discontinued and .our nunnery
praclice did fall off lamentably. Mr.
Gardner should know, if he is serious
in his investigations, that it has Im
proved since I (Daniels I restored the
elementary practice."
Restored In 1912.
Now. Mr. Daniels should have
known and it is only on h par with
his frequent misinformation that
elementary target practice was re
stored hv Secretary Meyer in Septem
ber, 191
Testimony to that effect appears in
Captain Sims' evidence before the
house committee on naval affairs
March S, llt: "I wish to make it
entirely clear that the mistake of
abolishing the short range practice
was due exclusively to naval officers.
It had nothing to do with the admin
istration of the navy department at
that time. The navy department acted
upon the advice of a limited number
of officers, and these officers made
the mistake above referred to."
Confirmed by Mayo.
Admiral Mayo, In his letter of tho
same date to the secretary of the
riHW stated:
"In lull no elementary practice
was held that is, no practice at
short raiiKe. This practice was omit
ted because many officers thought it
wbm n waste of ammunition to fire at
such ranees. . . . The effect of
the omission of tho short range prac
tice for the year was noted at once
and the practice resumed In 1912."
As to the parsimony of Secretary
Meyer, which Mr. Daniels rerers u,

CHICAGO, Oct. 19. President Wil
son came here today to explain
his view on problems facing the na
tion. Arriving in Chicago alter shak
ing hands with crowds in Indiana, he
delivered three speeches, participated
in several street demonstrations and
went over his western campaign plans
with his managers at headquarters
here. Ho left at midnight and will
arrive at Long Branch, N. J., at mid
night tomorrow.
In a speech before tho Chicago
Press club the president predicted the
beginning of "a renaissance of the
sense of patriotic responsibility," and
urged the development of progressive
ness. Speaking before a gathering of
women later ho urged more partici
pation of woolen in tho aifain oi the
nation, and at a meeting tonight of
new citizens; lie declared for a united
America.
At his every appearance the presi
dent was cheered by throngs which
packed the streets during his automo
bile rides and filled to rapacity the
halls In which he spoke. He stood
constantly in his automobile while
passing through the crowds and smil
ingly waved his hat at the people on
tho street and in tho windows of
buildings.
Women Are Trampled.
An attempted "silent demonstra
tion" by members of the national
woman's party in front of the Audi
torium developed into a near-riot in
which banners opposing Wilson were
torn from tho demonstrators and
trampled and the women were rough
ly handled.
President Wilson was seated in an
automobile a few hundred feet away
when the demonstration started, but
passed into the building and was not
a witness to the scene that followed.
Shouting "Shame!" "Disgraco "
and "Get the banners!" a crowd of
several hundred sprinkled with wom
en charged the banner-holders. I'm
brellas and canes were used in the
destruction of the placards. Many of
tho women wore knocked down and
nearly all were roughly handled, espe
cially those w ho strove to retain their
banners.
The excitement continued until -all
the banners had been seized. With di
sheveled hair and spoiled and torn
clothing the women marched back to
their hcadquurters under pi'-e guard.
Charges that the police s ..iputhized
with tho rioters and failed to protect
tho demonstrators were made by Mrs.
Josephine Pearce and Mrs. E. L. Mat
tico, officials of the local woman's
Republican clubs.
' There were all kinds of policemen
standing about merely looking on, not
moving a hund," said Mrs. Pearce.
"Some of them didn't seem to want
to help us. I saw policemen deliber
ately stand nearby and laugh at us
while we were being beaten und the
baiinci'B torn from our hands.
"We were merely standing quiet,
holding our banners and not harming
-anyone. Suddenly there was & regu
lar riot. They granoea our Danners,
trampled on them and knocked us
down. It was terrible."

Suing for Divorce.
SENSATION followed sensation yes
terday while tho divorce suit of
William Theodoro Pahmeyer against
Mrs. Kva Fisher Bowman was being
luurd before Judge llrecklnridgo of
the superior court. The climax cumo
during the testimony of Hev. Edwin
Wilcox wbo officiated at the wedding
of Pahn.eyer and a woman who
claimed she was Mrs. lCva Marie
1'isher Bowman. Looking at tho do
f'Midiint the minister said:
"This is not t lie woman I married
to Pahmeyer."
It was the supreme moment for the
defense. All evidence previously In
troduced by Mrs. Bowman's attorneys
to prove her contention that the was
never married to Pahmeyer led up to
this point.
Palineyer and Mrs. Bowman sit
with their attorneys en opposite sides
of the table In the courtroom. They
carefully avoided looking In the direc
tion of each other.
Mrs. Iloumim Alliuotivo,
Mrs. Bowman was tho center of all
eyes in the crowded courtroom. She
core a dark gray suit und a stylish
hat with a veil. She Is of the brunette
type and has a mass of black, curly
hair.
The trial began shortly after 11
o'clock yesterday morning. lion.
plaintiff and defendunt occupied the
vi'ness stand for almost an hour
each. Adjournment was taken at S
o'clock yesterday afternoon. One or
Iwo more witnesses are to be called
thts inormng.-Aivitments of attorneys
will follow and tho case will prob
ably be submitted to Judg Breckin
ridge for a decision some time this
afterncon.
More than a half hour yesterday af
ternoon was given to the testimony of
Reverend Wilcox, an Eulseopal rector,
formerly stationed at Fort Smith,
Ark., about which the Pahmeyer di
vorce suit revolves on July 28, 1915.
Since that time he has been trans
ferred o Webb Cly, Mo.
He is athletic in appearance and
represents tho more modern type of
minister, ins rnre fund of wit kept
the entire courtroom entertained all
ti e time he wis on the stand.
Asked if he recognized Puhmeyei
us the man who was married in his
church July 28 of last year he im
plied In he afflrmativo Questioned
as to how he rei '.embered that Mrs.
Bowman who was sitting ir. the court
room was not the woman who was
married at that time the rector an-
s-yored:
"She had an entirely different typo
or nguro.
"What do you mean by that," an
unorripy asKCd.
"Well, I should say the figure of the
woman I married to Pahmeyer would
have required a great deal of corset
ing to make It attractive," replied
Reverend Wilcox, and was followed
by r roar of laughter, other clever
sallies of tho rector kept the specta
tors and court attaches on keen edge
and caused discomfort to the cross
examiner. Anyone could see that Mrs. I'ow
man had not th- ehanietf ristics so
humorously described ny ihe minis
ter. She is slender and has black
eyes. Bevercnd Wilcox said the
woman who came to Fort Smith with
Pahmeyer had a round face, brown
eyes and very prominent gold teeth.
The rector got the Impression, he as
serted, that the woman was not Pah
meyer'8 intellectual equal.
Want'Ca.so to Continue.
When the case waa little more than
half through Judge Breckinridge an
nounced that he was ready to throw
It out of court, but to this Mrs. Bow
man's attorneys objected. They as
serted that the object of their cross
bill was to prove that Pahmeyer and
Mrs. Bowman never were married.
After a brief argument they were al
lowed to amend their pleadings and
continue the Introduction of testi
mony. Puhmcycr has withdrawn all claims
for property rights. He now asks only
an absolute divorce.
While on tho stand Pahmeyer re
peated the statements made In his
petition. He nsserted that he and
Mrs. Bowman went to Fort Smith and
were married In that city on July 2X,
1915. -They returned to Tulsa the
same day, ho said, and went to ,,rs.
Bowman's residence at 704 South
Houston. They lived together until
February 2, 1916, he said.
Pahmeyer asserted that he had In
troduced Mrs. Bowman as his wife to
relatives and that she did not ob
ject. He ever exhibited the marriage
license Issued at Fort Smith ami she
did tacitly acknowledge it, Jie claimed.
Mrs. Bowman met Pjhmeyer in
May of last year a a social given by
a local lodge. On or about July 30
of the same year he moved to tho resi
dence on Houston street.
It was his custom to turn over his
salary checks to Mrs. Bowman, pah
meyer averred. With this she paid
the runlng expenses of tho house, ho
declared.
Pahmeyer admitted that he had
been previously married and that his
divorced wife was now living In Cof
feyvllle, Kan. He also took out a
mnrrluge license In 1913 at Wagoner,
Okla., to marry a Pearl Hopping of
that place. But the ceremony was
never performed as Miss Hopping
broko the engagement after he had
procured the license, Pahmeyer said.

Brief Facts
for Voters
(By GLENN CONDON
It does not always icqiilre a mn
to'ity of the votes cast to elect a
president, tor instance. Wood
row Wilson is a "minority presi
dent". In 1912 ho received 6,292..
670 popular votes. In the same
election Roosevelt received 4,169,
412 votes and Taft 3.441,568 votes.
Admitting, for the sake of argu
ment, that the Republican candi
date in me coming election will
ceive as many votes as were ac
corded the Republican and Pro
gressive nominees combined in
1912, Mr. Hughes will get a total
of 7. til. uiiu votes. If this should
occur, Mr. Wilson, to be elected,
must receive at least 1,32(1.0(10
more votes than he got in 1912.
It Is admitted by political wise
acres of all parties that if Wilson
does not show more strength than
he evinced four years ago ho will
not be re-elected.
In response to several queries
concerning wagers on tho present
presidential campaign, It might bo
stated that in New York, the cri
terion In such matters, the betting
opened at two to one on Hughes.
This week they are offering only
ten to eight on the Republican
nominee, and this muy go to even
money. In Tulsa no odds are be
ing offered either way, but there
appears to bo plenty of Hughes
money, with few, If any, takers,

Siibiirbnnllcs Hit.
Residents of Maple Kidgo ami West
Tulsa were particularly haul hit bv
the Jitney suspension yesterday. With
out street car service these districts
depend almost entirely npoii the jit
neys. Practically every ear on the lines
of tho Tulsa Street Railway company
was crowded to capacity Curing tun
rush hours yesterday. Passenvers were
glad to get aboard the earn and lucky
Indeed were tho ones who obtained a
seat after the car bad tun a few
blocks from the end of i 1 r. run.
The street car company attiibnles its
inability to handle the traflu to lack
of advance warning from the jilney
men. Tho Jitneurs- announced through
The "World yesterday "morning that
they had quit but this was not in
tlmo for the railway corni nny to get
prepared for the rush. Whether the
company could have taken care of the
situation even wilh notification is
probloinantlcal.
Itefineiies and other industries in
West Tulsa suffered severely by the
lack of Jitney service. Many of the
workers at these places reside in Tulsa
and were unable to get to their work
before 9 or 10 o'clock. Many retail
stores In tho downtown district oper
ated with diminished forces for a part
of tho morning owing to the Inability
of their employes to get down town.
Mayor Hears Protest.
Protests poured into Mayor Sim
mons and the commissioners all day.
Many called the officials over the tele
phone, but others hunted them up lo
voice their sentiments In person. In
quiries und protests regarding the sus
pension of Jitneys were received all
day at The World office.
Mayor Simmons anil the conimis
sioners are firm in their detciniina
lion to place more stringent regula
tion on the jitneys. They declare that
the present manner in which the cars
are run is dangerous and that the city
Is responsible.
"Our suspension was not a piny for
piiDiic sympathy," said (art Muiipln,
secretary of the Jitneurs union, last
night, "but we are endeavoring to
make our friends realize what the jit
neys mean to them."
In addition to the passenger limit,
the ordinance places a license fee of
$75 a year on all drivers. The Jitneurs
say that this, with the cutting down
of their business end other regula
tions, is prohibitive to their business.

Bl.ACKWKI.L, Okla., Oct. 19.
Twenty hours ufter six men held
up Santa Pc passenger train No. 405
and killed a mail clerk, Percy Nor
man, and fscaped on horses toward
the Osage country, efforts to locate
them and bring them to Justice were
little further advanced than they had
been two hours al-r the crime had
been committed.
It Is apparent that the men took
straight for the Osage country and
crossed the Arkansas river some time
before daylight, thus putting tho
possible barrier to tl.clr liberty oe
hinil them.
Developments Thursday were to tho
effect that part of the men had been
camped in trie gully Just below where
tho train was held up nil afternoon
and that they had planned to make u
getaway In Just tho direction they
finally took. Plans had been made and
were being executed to patrol every
foot of the Arkansas river bank and
thus find just where the men had
crossed the stream.
Xo Chance Xow.
A heavy rain falling Thursday after
noon, succeeded by freezing tempera
ture, however, put an end to all
chances of a trace In that way. An
abandoned automobile was found west
of the city of Pawnee some time
Thursday and this was thought to pos
sibly have somo bearing on the possi
ble clue that part of the men were in
an automobile and the remainder on
horscf. The car has not been Identi
fied. An Inquest over the body of the
man killed by tho bandits found him
simply to have come to his death by
