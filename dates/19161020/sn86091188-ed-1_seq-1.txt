SOME MORE PRIZE WINNERS AT THE FAIR**
E. I*. Wolfe, who recently pur
chased tlie Agency property at Port
Lemhi for m the government, was
one of the iate.msted visitors at the ;
fair last week and expresses himself '
as being highly pleased with thi
sliowing Mr. Wolfe came to Lemhi
from Lieer Lodge. Montana, where
he ran a dairy for a number of years.
Since coming to tlie Agency lie lias
lieen preparing to enter Uie business
again by breeding * lierd of higii
grade Holstein*, of whlcii he now
has about forty liead of calves arK * j
voung stock. Mr. Wolfe contributed ,
to the livestock exhibtlou of the fair;
by bringing eiglit tiead of iiis young
cattle and two Percheron Colts and
received a premium on all but one of
his exhibits.
He said lie was highly in favor of
the fair being put into an association
and capitalized with sufficient capi
ta I to put up buildings and gatlier
tlie exhibits in one place so as to
make It easier to find the different
departments, and slated that lie |
would be wlljing to subscribe h»
, stock in such sn organization if such J
[was done, believing tliat it would s
! greatly increase the value of tiie ex
j hihition. The only erttiels n whicli
! tie had to offer, which wa» evidently
j an oversight on the part of tlie
I officials, was that no ribnons or »t* 1 * !
I er means cf identification were
placed upo.i vt-K-k winning seco"d
place as well as first, as tlie putilh
had no mean* of knowing which bail
