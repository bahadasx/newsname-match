London, Oct. 20.—Extremely turbu
day night are reported in a dispatch
from Router's correspondent in the
Greek capital. Greek reservists have
taken the law In their1 own hands, de
spite the pretence of allied marines.
"Tonight," the message reads, "It is
evident th$t the reservists are out of
hand, for despite the fact that strong
cavalry forces are escorting the French
and Greek marines and soldiers^ are
spread about everywhere, the re
servists, assembled in groups, have
taken the law in their own hands, and
the Green forces for the maintenance
of order do not dispose of them.
"The chief of the French police con
trol has Informed the editors of the
antl-Venizelos press that beginning to
morrow the French will exercise cen
sorship. Twenty-five officers and 600
men of the Athens garrison have gone
over to the national movement and
left for Balonikl."

has gone over to 'the revolutionists,

Episeopal Social Service Commission
Peihts Out Defects of Systems.
St. Louis. Oet. 20.—Need of an ulti
mate reconstruction of the entire
social schema and order properly to
abolish poverty, was urgedj'by the Joint
commission on social service of the
Protestant Bplscopal church In a re
port to the triennial general conven
tion of the churoh here today.
Housing conditions, recreation, vice
and crime were set forth as factors
that must be considered in any pro
gram of relief.
8igns are apparent, according to the
report that employers and capitalists
are uniting more closely to resist
further assaults by organized labor. It
Is apparent, however, the report added,
that a policy of repression will no more
put down industrial wars, than a simi
lar policy would control smallpox, or
other epidemics.
The report considered trade union
ism In detail and said that strike*,
lockouts and Industrial dtsputeis re
sult from efforts of labor to make the
best tenns possible with the employers
under the. present capitalistic system,
which said the report, ..the trade
unionists accept as the (basis of indus
trial, life.
In recent years, continued the report,
the trade union movement has been
discredited In the eyes of many, by its
apparently Increasing tendency to
violenoe. A common criticism of. the
union labor movement, It was stated.
Is that its leaders abuse their.power
and play petty politics.
Among other subjects bearing oh
tabor, the report considered the open
against the closed shop the allegedly
reactionary character of contemporary
trade unionism the employer's view
point and socialism and .. syndicalism
In their bearing on labor.
Syndicalism, said the report,' would
not have developed In this,country.hftd
organized capital and organized labor
been disposed to give the "man
furthest down" a fair chahce. On 'this
point the report said:
"It is precisely because the lqire^t
grades of labor, the least skilled fttd
the least literate workers, recruited as
they are largely from our newer
Americans, haVe been exploited by
manufacturers and comparatively neg-^
lected by the trade unions, that syndi
calism has developed."
In treating of welfare wdrk tjie re
port said that the workers in this
Country have not been, slow to recog
nise the motive whloh is at the base
of much welfare work, and have been
prompt to repudiate oharlty intended
as a substitute for strict-Justice.
Importance of co-operation of the
church in social service -wis urged, the
report insisting on the necessity' of
church inspiration in the movement to
ameliorate sufferings of mankind.
There would be great va\ue, smv*
urged, in a system by which Yffen and
women would be trained fior a social

lough^d to the i^ittrve u.fter one year's
honorable sarvtegkhas been suspended.
This action la wen, by army officers
as only anotherjfttdence of tlie incom
petence of the Hay act.
It has been stated by supporters of
the Hay bill .that tb'e provision would
be the best argument possible to ob

army. They asserted that it would be
much easier to obtain men if prospect
ive recruits could.lie assured that tliey
stood a chance of ."getting out of the
army after on^yettQ of honorable serv
ice.
The war department justified its or
der by saying: "Under the present
unusual conditions* which have caused
the concentration of so large a part
of the army and the mobilization
of most of the arjny resrve, he (the
secretary of war) 09es not believe that
approval of furloujjha to the regular

Comptroller Defends Rsaerve Law.
Indianapolis, Oct. 20.—John Skelton
Williams, comptroller of the currency,
speaking here today before the Farm
ers' National Congress, described the
relation-of the federal reserve law with
the farmer a^l closed with a personal
atatemeg^. brought out by President
Wilson's refcent altasion to attacks on
ibi comptroller
iri* that'.thn president said the
comptroller, "tells the country that the
bankers, or certain bankers, or some,
special interest, are after my official
scalp because I. as the comptroller of
the currency, -have enforced-1the law.
This is too surprise to me. I know that
I have been held up as a kind of agre,
a raw head and bloody bones, a terror
to the banking and financial interests
of the country. Majrbe the best answer
can be found to thatlln the indisputable
fact-that the hationar banks today are
stronger and better .than ever before
that they are more numerous Chan when
I became con\ptroller are more pros
perous and show a smaller proportion
of failures and losses than was ever
known In their history, and my office Is
receiving a steady stream of appli
cations for charters for national banks."
New Law a Curb,
Mr. Williams said the new federal re
serve law will forbid the "grasping
from using for their own advantages
the necessities of their neighbors."
"The farmer,"'he said, "Is enabled to
borrow accord'.nr to his industry and
oommercial standing because his bar
knows how and where to get tlfe
money. It will not be possible to have
the money supply locked In the great
centers for speculation or gambling
purposes while the real producers are
pinched or denied, perhaps, Just at the
time of their most Important need."
Cries of back to the farm, he said,
w?re futile without promise of coanfort
and happiness and proBpsrlty.
"Put money or. opportunity to earn
it," ihe said, "on the farm and the peo
ple will go to the farm fast enough.
This is precisely what the federal re
serve system Is. doing In large meas
ure and we hope the rural credit sys
tem will do It in even larger measure."
NEW SUFFRAGE PLAN.
Women Claim Right to Bay State Bal
lot Under National Law.
Boston, Oct. 20.—A new expedient,
aimed at obtaining the right of suffrage
for "women, is being tested In this state.
Women who have voted In states that
have extended the suffrage to them,
stich as California, Colorado and Ore
gon, have made formal demands in var
ious cities of Massachusetts, where
they now are resident, that they ue
registered as legal voters.
The claim is advanced that, having
qualified as a legal voter In one state,
a wpinjin who moves to another state
has thcT right to vote in the place of her
new residence.
In 'support of this claim, which is
to be pressed in the courts in each
Instance by the International Woman's
Suffrage Association, It is announced,
the organization points to sections of
the federal constitution which are al
leged to coyer tifts situation. ".Full faith
and crg}U shall be given In each state
to the public acts, records and Judicial
proceedings of every other state."
(Article 4t paction 1) and "The citi

helmer, president of the Master Bak
ers' Association of Chicago, observed

"That settles It. Something must be
done or there will be 7-cent bread in
Chicago."
Mr. Dahlheimer and a committee tried
to bring tihe matter to the attention of

"We will take the matter up with out

that way to bring the matter to tlfb

BIG DAM DEDICATED.
Recently Completed $6,000,000 Spillway
Impounds Biggest Artificial Lake.
Elephant Butte, N. M., Oct. 20.—The
Elephant Butte dam, completed recent
ly at a cost of $5.000.000, ahd intended
to impound the largest artificially re
tained iody of water in the world, was
dedicated here yesterday by A. A.
Jones, of New Mexico, personal repre
sentative of President Wilson. Three
hundred and fifty delegates to the In
ternational irrigation congress and in
ternational farm congress were the
dedication committee.
"It is now keenly realized that the
land, the coal, the petroleum, the tim
ber, and the vast possibilities for the
generation of electrical power have no
value, separate and apart from the
human beings who can put them Into
use," Mr. Jones declared in his speech.
"In order to secure the population
and to build up the communities It is
essential that such conditions be
brought about as will make living in
the west not only endurable but In
viting," Mr. Jones continued. "The first
essential is human food, and in this
arid country it can be obtained with
certainty and abundance thru the Irri
gation of land. It would seem, there
fore .that the funds to be derived from
the land and power resources In the
west could be devoted to no better pur
pose than that of aiding and assisting
irrigation.
'For some time the interior depart
ment has realized the inadequacy of
the present provisions for the comple
tion of Irrigation projects In the course
of construction. In the framing of leg
islation. which has been suggested to
congress for its consideration, the com
pletion of existing projects and the
possible construction of new projects
have always been kept In mind. In
suggested legislation provision was
made for the proceeds to become pri
marily a part of the reclamation funds,
but those proposed measures have not
been enacted.
"It is apparent, therefore, that an
appeal must be made to congress for
iiubstantial aid, which shall become
available without great delay. And
while we rejoice in the fact that the
dam is built, that this great stride in
the progress of the enterprise has been
Hjade, we should consider it largely an
encouragement to carry on the good
work, solve the new problems, and
bring to realization the vision which
Inspired the projeot."

Washington, Oct. 20.—Lieut Col.

Terrifio Destruction Wrought an
Bsttle Fislds of France Described in
Offioisl Csnsdisn Communication.
Ottawa, Ont, Oct. 20.—The terrifi#
destruction wrought on the battle
fields of France Is described in an of-'
flclal communique from the Canadian^
war records, which has been made
publlo by Lieut. Gen. 81r Sam Hughes,
minister of militia. Incidentally It re
iterates the claims of the British lead*
era In regard to the superiority of'the
allies In the air and In artillery, la
the latter respect the Canadian officer
says the allies are firing five shells to
the Germans' one.
Describing the devastation caused by
the tremendous struggle the communU
cation says::
"Never has human agency oontrolled
such engines of destruction nor has-,
war so profoundly impressed itself up
on the face of nature. No plegua
could be more ruthless, no natural
blight more devastating."
Peaceful 8oenes Near Battle Lines.
After describing the peaoeful scenes
In the rear of the battle lines, the per~
fectly tilled fields, the farms cultivated,
to the laM inch of their availaJble
space, and after paying a tribute to
the "brave, silent industry of the
women, the old men and the children"
of France, the statement continues:
"The transition from this scene of
beauty, peaoe and ancient prosperity
Is infinitely distressing. Fields are:
given over to the trampling rows of, ,.f
tethered horses and are disfigured byt.
a variety of encampments from
dered white tents to huts of rusted bis
cuit tins and low. discolored shacks of
nondescript material. This area of ac
tivity gradually thins and abuts a
gion of mora sinister appearaSadp.. gsre''
trees have broken bodies and u«
houses seem in pain for their roodBs are
rent, their windows gone, their .walls
scarred and pierced. But tit* full vie*
of the land of war Is reached afte«f
crossing the greasy slopes east of Al-1*
bert with their chalky scats cut by th«
long lines of trenches.
"The view suddenly swsqps Into thf
valley. Before L& Bolsselle there were
the original German and British lines
on July 1. This was the outer wall,
the stoutly resisting shell of the de
fense thru which the Indomitable Eng
lish had fought their way and so per
mitted those who followed, other Eng
lish, Canadian, South African and
Australian, to come and deal their
blows.
Upheavsl of Tortured Earth.
"There is more on the map than on,
the ground here. A splintered beam,
a cornerstone or two, and cellars. Oth
erwise only the upheaval of tortured
earth, mine craters, heaps of rotting
white sand bags, half-choked trenches
and a dreary litter of old wire, cans
and human rubbish remain.
"On the left Is the twin cltytof des
olation. Ovlllers, and between the two
the white road runs beyond and
mounts to the level of Poziere*.
"Postieres shared the fate of La Bols
selle. No hand could trace the out
lines of a single house or garden plot.
There are no bricks or beams which
could be used In restoration. As a vil
lage, Pozleres has disappeared.
"Just beyond Pozleres and below ths
summit runs a line of trenches first oc
cupied by the Canadians. This is In
the midst of the ground which has
suffered most. Here Is the same scene
of desolation. Ruin appears not only
In tho devastated earth and crushed
houses, but also In the e&ddcsr WJlSto of
human life. That Is all ground sacred
to the memory of our dead. Also In
tho scarcely defined trenches of ths
enemy the German corpses lie thickly.'*
