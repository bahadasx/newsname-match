No Details of Events Re
ceived Since Wednesday
Night.
London, Oct. 20.—Extremely turbu
lent conditions in Athene on Wednes
day night arc. reported in a dispatch
from Reuter's correspondent at the
Greek capital, sent that evening.
Greek reservists have taken the law
in their own hands despite the pres
ence of strong entente detachments of
marines who were given virtually no
assistance by Greek authorities in
maintaining order. The dispatch de
clares:
"Tonight, it is evident that the re
servists are out of hand. They as
sembled in groups, taking the law in
to their own hands, and Greek forces
for the maintaince of order do not
dispose of them. The chief of the
French poliqe control informed the
editors of the anti-Venizelos press
that beginning tomorrow the French
will exercise' a newspaper censorship
and newspapers writing anti-Entente
articles will run the risk of suspen
sion."
The foregoing, although bringing
news of developments In Athens only
up to Wednesday night, is the latest
report received on the situation there.
DRY BOOSTERSBUMPED
BY WET, COLD WEATHER
Wet Enthusiasts Also Interfere With
Hanly Special in the Ohio
Tour.
Cleveland, O.. Oct. 20.—Wet advo
cates and rain met the dry special
train on its tour today across Ohio
from Union City, Ind., to Cleveland.
A drlKle fell throughout the day, re
ducing to a few the crowfls that listen
ed to fear platform speeches of the
prohibition national candidates. In
Gallon and Shelby loquacious wets In
terrupted the meetings with' protests
against the speakers' statements.
One of the wets took the speakers'
stand at Shelby and' attempted to
make a speech, but was hooted down
by the crowd. J. Frank Hanly, the
presidential candidate, had just fin
ished speaking and had given way to
Ira Landrith, the vice presidential
candidate, when the wet advocate in
terrupted.
"You can't make this country dry
and I can prove it," he shouted. "I'll
come right up there and do It now if
you want me to."
Landrith invited the man to the
platform and the invitation was ac
cepted. Before he had time to speak,
however, the crowd insisted that it
did not come to hear him and he re
tired.
At Gallon a man interrupted Oliver
W, Stewart, the special manager, but
when Stewart asked him to repeat his
remarks he retired.
Hanly conflned himself to arguing
that the liquor traffic was challeng
ing the sovereignty of the American
people and that it formed a danger
ous "Invisible government." I^andrlth
pleaded for mora] people to exercise
the right of suffrage more freely.

Forces Operating Near Ta
hora, German East Af
rica, are Defeated.
London, Oct. 20.—In a review of
recent operations In German East
Africa, issued here today, the war of
fice announces that the Belgians oper
ating near Tabora, in the northern
central part of the colony, have in
flicted further defeat on the Germans.
In fighting from September 18 to 22
the surviving portion of the German
forces which had been defeated at
Tabora was routed.
Along the coast the British forces
under General Smuts are engaged in
clearing the country. A number of
small columns are carrying on this
work southeast of Dar-Es-Salaam and
northwest of Kliwa.
General Smuts says his troops have
been attempting to drive into the
Rufljl valley German posts established
north and south of that region.
The remnant of the force defeated
by the Belgians was driven eastward
and southward, the Germans making
an attempt to effect a junction with
the main German body concentrated
In the Huflji valley.
The bulk of the remaining German
forces, says the announcement, are
now conflned In a limited area in the
southeastern portion of the colony, of
which all the ports on the coast and
the main lines of approach are held
by the entente forces.
The entire Rufljl valley and the
delta are unhealthy and malarious to
the highest degree and are declared
likely to become untenable after the
advent of the "lesser rains'^' during
October.

Rome, Oct. 20.—:George Barr Baker
of New York, a member of the Amer
ican commission for relief of Belgium,
has come to Rome on a mission to
Pope Benedict. Mr. Baker set before
the pontiff the desperate condition of
a million and a half children in Bel
gian territory occupied by Germany
who are so reduced from practical
starvation that, if not aided, they
soon will be beyond help, and those
who survive will be mentally de
ficient.
The commission appeals to the
pope to exercise his influence with
American archbishops and bishops so
that American school children may
each adopt e. Belgian child at a cost
of three cents daily.
The pontiff listened most sympa.
thetically and gave his full support
to the project.
Mr. Baker came to the Vatican at
the instance of Herbert Hoover, chair
man of the American commission for
relief of Belgium.
Mr. Baker told the pope that the
Belgian children were reduced below
normal weight and were suffering
bodily ills through under nourish
ment. He said that tuberculosis was
increasingly prevalent and had risen
from 7 to more than 13 per cent.
Mr. Hoover proposes to give the
children a supplementary daily meal
of a cup of chocolate or milk and one
sweetened biscuit made with lard.
Experience has shown that this ad
dition to their diet will maintain their
condition at normal and will restore
those already weakened.

GEN. WiOilCK
HAS RETIRED
Noted German Commander
in Dash on Paris in 1914
Badly Wounded.
Berlin, Oct. 19.—Via London, Oct.
20.—Field Marshal Alexander H. R
von Kluck, who commanded the right
wing of tho German army in its sweep
toward Paris, in the fall of 1914, has
been placed on the retired list at his
own request. He had never returned
to the front since he was wounded
by shrapnel flre In March, 1915, while
Inspecting an advanced position. The
field marshal was 70 years old last
May.
Von Kluck and his army took an
Important part in the German ad
vance toward Paris in September,
1914. His advance halted about thir
ty miles from' the French capital and
his force with the rest of the Oermar
army was checked and driven back
In the battle of the Marne.
Von Kluck was born in Muenster,
Germany, May 20, 1846, and entered
the German army as a second lieuten
ant in 1865. At the outbreak of the
present war he was in command of
the army corps at Koenlgsberg. He
fought in the war against Austria in
1866 and in the'Franco-Prussian war
In 1870.
He is said to have received his
wound In March, 1916, by recklessly
exposing himself after a stormy Inter
view with Emperor William. Last
August it was reported, he was soon
to take a command. on the eastern
front. His son, Lieutenant Egon von
Kluck was reported killed at Middle
kerke, early In 1915.

The cost of this meal is three cents
for each child daily, and Mr. Hoover
hopes to obtain the assistance of the
American Catholic clergy in enlisting
the American children in relief work.
Washington, Oct. 20.—Suggestions
in England for curtailment of the
work of the Belgian relief commis
sion because its supplies might reach
Belgians whose services had been
commandeered by Germany, have
been called unofficially to the atten
tion of the state department but the
subject has not been taken up diplo
matically.
The state department is anxious to
do all it can to prevent any misunder
standing which would cripple the
work of the commission, but it is re
alized that from the beginning the
state of the organization has been ex
tremely delicate in that it stands be
tween two determined groups of bel
ligerents.
The natural incompleteness ot Eng
lish knowledge about what has been
transpiring- in Belgium and the re
alization that Germany would enforce
vigorously what she felt to be her
rights has given rise to a constant
fear that either side might unwitting
ly precipitate a situation which would
make continuance of relief work haz
ardous. Officials recognize that both
England and Germany earnestly de
sire to help the Belgians, but that
both naturally have held that destre
secondary to the greater question be
tween them.

New York. Oct. 20.—President Wil

that the reactionary leaders opposed
to his election were "after the scalp"
of the present controller of currency
because he had obliged the banks to
obey the laws for the first time in
many years, brought forth a bitter at
tack from George W. Perkins in the
form of a letter which he addressed
to President Wilson yesterday.
Mr. Perkins says: "The audacity of
some of the statements made yester
day is past belief." He criticises the
"Seven Sisters" and the Clayton bill,
and speaks of a sort of political tango
which, he says, Mr. Wilson has per
formed whenever groat questions pre
sented themselves.
Mr. Perkins' letter says:
Hon. Woodrow Wilson, President of
