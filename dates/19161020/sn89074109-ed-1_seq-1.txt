C. J. N. Nelson
at Hettinger
C. J. X. Nelson is spending the
week at Hettinger, where he has
charge of a Teacher's Institute,
Below we print a brief resume of
the progress made by 'the Beach
Schools in the last eight years dur
ing which time Mr. Nelson was Sup
erintendent.
The Beach Iligli School was or
ganized September 141h, 1908 with
two pupi's the first week, Glenn Wal
lace and Caleb Heath. Alvin Hov
erson, Theodroe Hoverson and Ulsie
Jordan enrolled a few days after.
Alvin having freshmen credits from
Glendive started the Sophomore
year. Dorothy Heath aud Harry
Heath of Mandan joined the Sopho"
more class later in the fall.
The board of education consisted
of E. E. Dickinson, president F. E.
Near and P. C. Erickson, directors.
In June 1009 Mr. 0. M. Olson was
elected in the place of Mr. Erickson
who retired and in 1911 Mr., Ed
Hoverson succeeded Mr. Near. This
board consisting of Mr. Dickinson.
Mr. Hoverson and Mr. Olson was
maintained intact until 1915.
In November 1908 maroon and
white were adopted by the school as
the school color,
On December 19, 1908 the first re
ception was held at the State Line
Hotel which was the prelude to the
annual Junior Senior reception. The
seven pupils enrolled together with
the board of education and the fac
ulty and a few others were present.
The High School Athletic Asso
ciation was organized in November
1908.
On January 18, 1910, Prof, llicli
ard Hey ward, State High School
inspector inspected the school for
the first time and recommended the
school for 3rd class classification
which we received. On April 11,
1911 the school was recommended
for 2nd class classification and ap
proved. On June 2, 1911 was held
the first High School
Commencement
and Alvin Hoverson was the
first,
graduate. He chose for the em
blems of the school the Trowel and
level which he presented to the pres
ident of the Junior class with tilt
hopes that they would continue to
build constructively the future of
the institution.
On March 5, 1912, Mr. Hoverson
and Supt. Nelson went to Fargo to
present to the State High School
Board the appeal from this section
of the state to have the Beach High
School named as one of the State
Agricultural High Schools with
special state aid to teach agricul
ture consisting of $2,500.00 annu
ally. To comply with the applica
tion blank for such a school the
board met all requirements for a
first class High School including
departments in manual training and
domestic science and also enlarged
the faculty, in proportion. As a
result of the efforts of Mr. Hover
son and Supt. Nelson the Beach
High School received the coveted
classification and opened a wide
field for the school for future use
fulness.
In March 1914 the North Central
Association of Colleges approved of
the school as a firs* class school
and gave us a national standing and
the severe conditions imposed on
the High Schools belonging to this
association have been complied with
fully to the present time.
The school is only eight years old
but has a full science equipment for
physics and agriculture, a fair
equipment for chemistry, physical
ge9graphv. Physiology, botany,
zoology, horticulture. Courses are
offered in domestic science, manual
training, commercial, special as
well as courses strictly for college
entrance. The school has a Junior
High and offers music and drawing
in all grades.
Prof. Nelson is recognized as one
of the leading educators of the state
having been elected president of the
City Superintendents' Association.
He stands for practical education
believing that it is of vastly more
importance for the young people to
learn practical things than to study
Xatin and Greek.

"The Debate"
We had a {treat debate
In U. S. History the other day
And I have just a few remarks
About the thing to sny:
Affirmatives were to make plain
That it is just and fair
That dear U. S. should start at once
Willi great speed to prepare.
They said, "U. S. is very weak,
And could not win a fight
Against the other nations (might
Who had greater strength and
They said, "The Kaiser had within
Our sight, some ships gopopwd"
And made it plain how this hero
work,
Oiijhl really to be stopped.
Then up jumps negatives of course.
They always see tilings wrong,
And with a lew statistics
They sang loud their little song.
They say, "U. S. should not pre
pare"
And say, "We're strong enough.
We ought to be obsequious
And take a little bluff."
In spite of all the arguments
Affirmatives fought on,
In spite of all refuting made
The negatives have won.
Affirmatives are much displeased
And seem to think that they
Are greatly wronged in heart and
soul
Because they lost th daj.
They say that they can ne'er forgive
And say with smiles and nudge
That, "Not to raise a rumpus, but
The Neg's have br.bed the judge."

tail itiiik Carrier
of Paralysis Germ
Baltimore, Oct. 17.—Dr. Horace
T. Burrows, patholigist at Johns
Hopkins hospital, has found the in
fantile paralysis germ discovered
nine years ago by Dr. Simon Flex
ncr of Rockefeller institute.
Dr. Burrows and*his assistants,
under the direction of Professor
William II. Welch, have been mak
ing auioposiefjj upon every victim
of the disease since July in a care
ful microsopic search.
Results Called Conclusive
It has been found that the germs
occur only in the colon. The inves
tigations prove that 100 per cent
are infected in this big intestine. It
is only possible for 'the germs to
enter the big intestine by way of the
mouth in food and drink.
This discovery demonstrates for
the first time clearly that raw food,
the milk and water fed babies, con
tains the germ of infantile paraly
sis.
The investigators are so certain
there is no other way that they sug
gest the quarantine be raised against
personal contact anl that all the
raw foods, such as milk, water and
fruits, be sterilized by being boiled
or cooked before beiiio- given to
children and others.
Clears Up Doubts
This discovery is the first one that
has ever been given out officially by
the Johns Hopkins hospital befole
it was published in some exclusive
scientific journal.
The rule is broken in order to
clear up the mystery of infantile
paralysis as quickly as possible in
order to allow schools to opes and
business to go on as usual.
LABOR REQUIRED
IN GROWING WHEAT
It requires 12 1-2 hours of hum
an labor and 30 of horse labor to
produce an ace of wheat in Min
nesota. These figures were secured
in an investigation carried out dur
ing the years 1909-12 under the dir
ection of Thomns Cooper, then with
the Minnesota Experiment Station,
but now director of the North Dako
ta Experiment Station.
If the yield was 12 1-3 bushels
per acre each bushel would require
one hour of human labor and nearly
2 1-2 hours of horse labor while if
the yield were 24 2-3 bushels only
about half 'as mucjh labor would
be required per bushel.

P. D. Norton, Congressman for
North Dakota, will deliver an ad
dress to the voters of Golden Valley
county at 8 p. m. October 25, in
behalf of the National Republican
ticket. Mx*. Norton is a very cap
able speaker and what he has to
say about the Wilson administration
as well as the platform of the Re

interest to every voter in the county.
County Chairman J. P. Reeve and
Secretary J. M. Still have, charge
of the arrangements for this meet
ing and are putting forth every ef
fort to make it a real Republican
rally.
Mr. Norton will speak at Sentinel
Butte at two o'clock in the afternoon
of the same day. As party lines are
not drawn so closely today as they
were a few years ago it is thought
that a good many Democrats, as
well as Republican* will avail them
selves of the opportunity of hearing
the Republican side of it given
voice.

At every school there were sig

pe iieserves
a Norma! School
The need of an additional normal
school for the southwestern part of
the state is generally admitted. Xo
man claims that North Dakota is
too poor to support sufficient normal
schools to train her teachers. In
fact, she can't afford to do anything
else. Our state is rich and pros
perous. Royal are the gifts of na
ture to North Dakota. We have a
soil which bountifully rewards tbe
labors of the husbandman and year
ly fills to overflowing his granaries
and barns a climate so propitious
that from the hour of its earliest
settlement live stock of all kinds
have been a profitable investment
coals and clays in inexhausted and
almost inexhaustible abundance the
lir and sky and earth and water, all
combining to pour their richest
treasures into the lap of this fav
ored commonwealth.
Yet with all these riches, poor in
deed must be the state, if it cannot
afford to see to it that the teachers
of all its children are properly train,
ed for their calling. It is not mills
and factories and farms and cattle
that constitute a state. It is integ
rity and virtue, and intelligence and
culture, and conscience and charac
ter that make a great and thriving
commonwealth and give it true re
nown. So the gravest of all the
questions that ever came up for set
tlement still forces itself upon our
attention: How shall we best pre
pare the citizens of the future for
lie proper discharge of the duties
that come to them? Surely we can
do better than answer the question
in the spirit in which it was answer
ed by the fathers, in the great Or
dinance of 1787, that "schools and
the means of education should be
forever encouraged," and strong and
deep should the foundations of cul
ture and character be laid.
Whatever will improve the meth
ods of instruction in our schools
whatever will provide better teach
ers for our children and our child
ren's children whatever will digni
fy the work of the teacher, and thus
enlarge and uplift the lives of the
boys and the girls of today, who
are to be the citizens of tomorrow,
will merit the support and approval
of every believer in North Dakota's
greatness, and every lover of the
state that is known far and wide
as the land of opportunity.
There Should Be Four

normal school would cripple the nor

not based 011 experience. Every
school in the late is crowded for
all say "we are crowded, if we had
any more, what would we do.'"' In
building a normal school for the
people of western North Dakota you
are taking nothing away from other
sections because eighty-seven per
cut of the population of the several
state schools is
ft,,:u
the territory
immediately contiguous. In order
io get any large number of pupil*
to attend school from west of the
river WE MUST i'UT A SCHOOL
THERE: otherwise we will never get
them to go. Only three per cent of
the youth 111 the state schools are
from the Slope. Let the question be
studied in the light of history. In
Michigan for some years, there was
but one »tate normal school, that at
Ypsilanti. Some friends of that
school opposed the further exten
sion of the system. Later, how
ever, this opposition was broken
down and in course of time three
more state normal schools and num
erous county normals were estab
lished. The gain iit attendance at
Ypsilanti has exceeded, since the
opening of these schools, the en
tire enrollent in the three other
schools, and all have prospered.
Wisconsin in 1909 opened her eighth
normal school and now enrolls over
3000 teachers in these schools.
It Would Not Increase Taxes
A -word is due to those who hold
that an additional normal school
would entail too much expense 011
the state. TAXES WILL BE NO
HIGHER because a new building is
located advantageously for an un
schooled contingency. The school
constitution and the limit thus al
lowed has always been used in its
entirety. They can be 110 higher
under the law. A few facts culled
from the report of the commissioner
of education indicate how meaget
is the present provision for the pre
paration of public school teachers.
The maintenance of public normal
schools—state, county and city—
costs the taxpayers of the nation
about $6,600,000 annually. At first
blush this would seem to be a lib
eral sum but when one remembers
that it is divided aim»ng 170 schools,
the seeming liberality

would do no more than pay for the
annual maintenance of Harvard and
Columbia universities. Yes, the

half enough to build and equip one

that
of "The Stepping Stone,'' a new
Triangle play starring Frank Kee
nan and Mary Boland.
It. takes the biggcM step so far in
the amazing social revolt of
the
modern woman. The old idea of
woman as a stepping-stone for
the
male, has for some time been chal
lenged by woman herself but,
de
spite the constantly swelling army
of suffragists, her representatives
have been isolated members of
her
sex.
Sullivan takes the attitude
that
the thinking man may prove instru
mental in bringing that woman
who
has not heeded the call of her sis
ters, to her rightful place. In
his
story, a man who has won his
way
to the top, finds the type of
woman
he has been seeking all his life
the
wife of a man who never can ap
preciate her and he then and there
determines to secure her for
his
own. The manner of his doing this,
constitutes a thrilling action and
hammers home the moral with
real
punch.
"The Stepping Stone," should
