The excitement continued until all

"Some of them didn't seem to want to
help us. I saw policemen deliberately
stand near-by and laugh ai its while
we were being beaten and the banners
torn from our hands.
"We were merely standing <iuiet.

Negro waiters employed at the press j
t.'luli utili/.ed the presence of I'resi-|
dent Wilson at lunch there to gain for!
themselves a raise in wages, without
investigation and without compromise.
Just before the President was due to
arrive, thirty special waiters, who
were to serve the luncheon, put oti
their coats, preparatory to waiking
out. They had not asked for more
pay. but when stopped by the steward
told him they had decided they must
have a AO per cent increase on the
contract price before they would be^in
their duties. The advantage was
theirs, and the increase was grunted.
Mrs Wilson accompanied the Presi
dent, and drew almost as much ap
plause.
Itetween his speech to the women !
ind his night address the President 1
went to the Western Democratic cam- !
paign headquarters and. for I lie first i
time, witnessed the details of the ma-)
?hincr.v used In an effort to ic-clccl
tint. Senator Walsh, chairman of tin
headquarters, told the President that
"a. decided swing had set in in the
West for the Meinocratic ticket."
At the nteeiinir of women the I'resi- i
?lent was introduced by Mrs Kila
I'lagg Young, former superintendent of j
'hicago'a schools, who declared lie had!

A:, yet no decisive result has been
achieved by cither the Austro-Germau

several days in Volliv ilia and Galicia.
The I'etrograd War Olllce says that
near Kisolin and Svinusky, in Volhynia,
violent attacks by the Teutonic allies
were repulsed, while Merlin rceoids the
capture of Russian trenches on the
west bank of the Stokhod and the re
pulse, with hoavj casualties, of Kus

South of Xhorow. in Gali<\ia, several
enterprises have been carried out suc

other points attacks by the Russians
have boon repulsed.
The Roumanians have taken the of
fensive at several points, and now are
reported to be pushing back their ad
versaries. who are leaving prisoners
ami guns in the hands of the Rouinn
nians. Merlin. however, controverts
this by the assertion that tlie Austro
German forces are engaged in success
ful lighting in the mountain passes.
Generally speaking. there is no
change in the situation in Macedonia,
