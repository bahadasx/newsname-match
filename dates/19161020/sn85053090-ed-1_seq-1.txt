Wilson's Stand on Votes For Women
Contrasted With Hughes' Wabbling
HUGHES.
Ho iliil not vole for Suffrage wlien
lie had the chance.
Suffrage (»lank in Hcpubli'-nn plat
form: "The Itepublican parly, re
ufîirming its faith in government
of the people, us a measure of jus
tice to one-half the adult people of
the country, favors the extension
of the suffrage to women, but rec
ognizes the right of each State to
settle this question for itself."
A few days before his public in
dorsement of the Federal Suffrage
amendment, a committee of Amis
visited him, came out smiling and
said lie was the man of the hour.
The Suffragists had a similar ex
perien 1 e at the same time.
Mr. Hughes has said (hat suf
frage is the result of social unrest,
I hat it will cause sex antagonism
and I hat it raises a disturbance
which might a-i well be stopped.
HUGHES FOR SUFFRAGE BECAUSE HE 'S AGAINST IT.
In a letter to the New York World, Senator C. S. Thomas, of Colo
rado. a member of the Committee on Woman Suffrage of the United
Suites Senate, said on Sept. 14:
"I am moved to propound the following Inquiry to the Republican can
didate for President: I)id lie not say to a committee of Anti-Suffragists,
I have always been opposed to woman suffrage, probably because Mrs.
Iluphes lias always been strongly opposed, and my daughters think with
their mother. The increasingly active feminist movement, to my mind,
makes the ultimate granting of votes to women lamentable, but inev
itable. Sex antagonisms and the subversion of national issues Into petty
personal issues is to me more lamentable still, more ruinous to our
womanhood and our country, than the doubling of the electorate, or votes
foi' women, calamitous as that may bo ' "
And when Candidate Hushes subsequently declared for the Federal
amendment it was on the ground Mint. inasmuch as the women were
bound to have the vote, it should be given to them by the shortest pos
sible route, irrespective of the merits of the question.

On Sept. 9 he made a special trip
to Atlantic City to address the Na
tional Woman Suffrage Associa
tion.
"I have come to fight with you.
not against you," he said. "Woman

THE FIT CANDIDATE
Some of Those We Feel Merit
Your Support.
Emil F. Len'z is asking your
support for the office of county
clerk, not on any promises of
what he shall do, but what he
has done for you in the past.
Since the creation of Fallon
county, Mr. Lentz has been your
county treasurer and as to his
qualifications to fill tne office of
iounty cierk he invites you to
consider his past record. Fallon
county should elect a man for the
:ounty clerk job who can be de
Dended on to do the work and do
it promptly. Such a man is Mr.
Lcntz.
Fallon County needs a man in
the legislature who will command
attention and respect, one who
has resided with us long enuugh
o understand the needs of our
oeople and who is not afraid to
>tand up and fight every move
that tends to leave us "holding
the sack." The man for that
particular job in Fallon county
h Berry Morris, a man vvho
while never having entered into
the spirit of playing politics very
much has at all times been inter
ested and assisting with the
upbuilding of the county and the
state, Berry Morris is no strang
Cl iUiiVi.t, uc and if you want a
representative who is honest —
every inch of him—vote for Mr.
Morris.
Regardless of their political
belief, the voters of Fallon coun
ty should consider a candidate's
qualifications before casting their
ballot on election day. When a
candidate has already proven his
ability to handle your affairs in a
certain capacity as a county of
ficial he should certainiy be en
titled to your support for re elec
tion. Chas. E. Hughes, our pres
ent county assessor has served
you well for the past two years,
even though it was his first "of
fense for being a county officer.
He has made good and we doubt
if there is a stronger man on the
democratic ticket. Justice to all
and no special favors, has been
Charlies' motto and while riot
taking advantage of any taxpay
er he has so conducted his asses
sing work that Fallon county has
benefitted greatly thereby. His
past record entitles him to your
vote on election day.

Holiday Plans
And Preparedness
Probably you haven't thought about
your Christmas plans, but we have been
doing some planning and thinking for
you. We are now making selections of
Holiday Goods from many sources. The
European War has caused a shortage in
some lines during the past two holiday
seasons, but such will not be the case
this year. Ingenious American Manufac
turers have been busy, so there will be
no dearth of holiday goods in line. In
about four weeks we will have an inter
esting line of gift goods for your inspec
tion.
RELIABLE DRUG STORK
week of the withdrawal from the
race for county superintendent
of schools of the name of Miss
Annette Leanord, the republican
candidate. This action was tak
en by Miss Leanord on account
of her marriage last Saturday to
Mr. O, T. Denison of Baker and
because she intends to leave the
count# at the expiration of her
present terni of cffice on January
Is*. In order that their ticket
might be filled as to this respect
ive office and wishing to promote
a lady of their choice, the repub
licans at a meeting held Monday
urged Miss Stella Olsen, the pres
ent deputy under Miss Leanord,
to accept the vacancy and make
the run for the election to this
office. Miss Olsen needs no in
troduction to the people of Fal
lon county. For the past two
years she has been in the super
intendent's office and with Miss
Leanord has brought this office
to the present high standard
which it is regarded by the s I d to
superintendent's office. While
Miss Olsen is rather handicapped
by entering the race at this late
date her manv friends are going
to see that she gets a big vote ai!
( ver the county and it.' possible
the election. Miss Olsen has
been a resident of Fallon county
for the past eight years, has
taught school in many < f the
rural communities and is well fit
ted for the po ition. She is a
Montana girl, having been born
near Great Falls, in whh-h ei'.v
she graduated with horse s from
the giaded and high schools.
Her selection as our county sup
erintendent will mean that the
j schools of Fallon cum!y arc ; •
j sured of proper attention from
! the superintendent's office find
j prompt attention tu all school
! matters.
! While Miss Olsen happens to
be one of those often termed
j "dear sister-in-laws" to the ed
itor. we do not want the voters
j to consider the above item as be
: ing merely a boost to satisfy our
! personal feelings or to keep peace
j within the family. Anyone who
: has met Miss Olsen, either in the
I capacity of assistant superintend
;ent or as a teacher knows her
I sterling worth and that she is en
titled to this gift from the vot
' ers.
!
From the accounts in the Miles
j City papers the Odd Fellows in
I state convention there are hav
! ing a big time. À number from
I Ekalaka are in attendance 1 and it.
I is needless to say that these boys
i will aave a time. Custer Canton
j No. 6 of Ekalaka is conferring
I some of the degrees and compet
j ing in the drill contests.
