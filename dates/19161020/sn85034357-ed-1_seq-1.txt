"RESERVE BANK
CITY OF REFUGE"
Russell Banker Says Federal Re?
serve Act is Greatest Legisla?
tion Ever Enacted For the
Common Man.
In view of tlie statements made by
Republican speakers in this county in
reference to the elfecl of the Reserve
bank system upon the Southwest, and
the further fact that certain speak?
ers have stuted that not a single per?
son in the Southwest, the ninth dis?
trict particularly had been benefitted
in any way whatever by the reserve
bank in Richmond, we investigated the
matter and find that the greatest
possible benefit has been given to the
farmers and others in counties in the
ninth district.
We publish below a letter from
President Gilmer of the Pirta Na?
tional Bank at Lebanon, which states
the matter of benefit to the peonle in
plaia language. President Gilmer's
bank at Lebanon is not the only bank
in Russell county that has found the
reserve bank in Richmond a great
help to the farmers of the country:
The letter follows:
Lebanon, Va.. Oct. 17, 191G.
Clinch Valley News,
Tazewell, Va.
Your note of yesterdny is before I
me. The First National Bank of Leb-1
anon, Va., has made free use of the
Federal Reserve Bank at Richmond,
Virginia. We have sent more than
$GO,000 in notes of farmers, mer?
chants and stock men to that insti?
tution and gotten the money on them
within the last eighteen months. The
Federal Reserve Act is the most ben?
eficial law for the common man that
has been enacted since this was a na?
tion. Money panics arc things of the
past. The Federal Reserve Banks arc
cities of defense and refuce?defense
against the money power and refuge
for the agricultural and commercial
interests of the country.
Yours very trulv.
V. B. GILMER.
BOB AND THE SENATOR.
Do A Little "Spell-Binding" For Mr.
Slemp at Tip Top.
A party of gentlemen from this
town had the unexpected pleasure on
last Saturday afternoon of hearing
Republican County Chairman R. O.
Crockett and Ex-Senator J. N. Bar?
man make political speeches to an
audience at Tip Top. The party left
here in a fast car and reached the
appointed place at the church about
3:30. When the party, (seven of
them* filed into the church, Senator
Harman was sneaking, explaining in
detail the blunders of the administra?
tion's Mexican uolicy, and the com?
plete failure of the reserve bank to
grant the relief expected. He sur?
prised his lnrge audience, (eighteen
before we went in), by the statement
that a gentleman from Tip Ton had .
written the reserve bank in Richmond
for a loan and was refused, the ollic
ials of the reserve bank informing
the Tip Top brother that they were
not in the money loaning business.
Comment upon a statement of the
kind made by the Senator is unneces?
sary as a majority of the readers of
this paper are intelligent enough to
know better.
Some of his audience expected a
statement like this: "There is a gen?
tleman in this audience who has just
received n letter from the Treasury
in Washington, to whom he had writ?
ten for n loan of a hundred dollars.
The U. S. Treasurer, assisted h" the
Secretary of the Navy and the Secre?
tary of War have had the gall to
write the brother at Tip Top a let?
ter in which they told him that the
Treasury department didn't make in?
dividual loans, but that if he would
apply to the Tazewell National or
the Clinch Valley banks at Tazewell
he could get the loan, but, in case
they. didn't have the money to tell
them the reserve bank in Richmond
had a plenty if they needed any."
If inquiry had been made at any
of the Tazewell banks, a reply some?
thing like this would have been forth?
coming: "The Tazewell banks oc?
cupy a peculiar position and a very
fortunate one. Our resources arc
such that we can conduct our busi?
ness, make our loans, accommodate
our customers with more ease than
some other smaller banks in this
section. But, if it ever comes to a
point where we expect trouble, we
are prepared to meet it."
Senator Harman was unwell Sat?
urday, which -robably accounts for
his statement above quoted.
Mr. R. O. Crockett followed the
Senator and spoke briefly on the won?
derful legislative career of Mr. Slemp
and what an awful liar hi3 oppo?
nent, Mr. Trinkle, had developed into.
Bob said a good many things uncom?
plimentary of the Democratic candi?
date which his hearers from Taze?
well, who were his friends, swallow?
ed in silence and pity. Bob wound
up his remarks by announcing the
rally to be held here Monday. While
he was speaking several freight trains
pnssed loaded to the limit with Clinch
/t. Valley coal on the way to the enst
ern markets at the highest price ever
known in the history of the business.
It is said that several of these cars
were from Senator Harman's coal
mines at Raven, which are working
to capacity.
The party on the way to Tip Top
passed a number of the farmers of
the community, some building hous?
es, others garnering their crops and
feeding their stock, all apparently
satisfield with the prosperity of the
country. While on this trip the re?
port was received that the Norfolk
& Western had an engineering corps
surveying a new road from the Wolf
Creek connection down Clear Fork
to come out at the Burke's Garden
siding to take care of the large vol?
ume of coal coming from the Clinch
Valley section, which was* causing n
serious congestion on the Bluencld
yards.
Of the twenty-four brethren in the
Tip Top audience, ten of them were
Democrats.

JAIL SENTENCE FOR SPEEDING.
Bluefield Joy Riders Como to Grief
Here Lnst Saturday.
Six Bluefield joy riders .came to
grief here last Saturday afternoon.
They were Guy Thomas Bailey, owner'
and driver of the car; Frank E.
Hytes, G. C Roberts, John Jonos, W.
W. Neel and J. H. Morgan. They
were urrseted b" Sergeant Thompson
Saturday afternoon and tried before
Magistrate Patton Saturday night.
The lirst four, Bailey. Hytes, Roberts
and Jones, were given live days in
jail and twenty-five dollars tine; the
last two. Neel and Morgan, were lined
$10 each and costs. The four who
were given jail sentences uppeuled to
the Circuit Court and were released
on bond to appear here at the next
term of Circuit Court for trial.
The men were drinking, three of
them Hytes, Roberts and Jones being
in a pretty bad shape. Morgan ap?
peared to be entirely sober, and Neel
soon sobered up after Dr. Crockett
dnished sewing up his face.
A phone message came to town
about 5:30 Saturdav afternoon from
Wittens Mills to arrest the men who
were reported to have passed E. K.
Crockett/! residence, at a terrific
speed. They were not stopped here,
and the next thing heard from them
was from Joe Crockett's, west of
town, where their car was wrecked
by running into a rock near the res?
idence of Mr. Crockett and smashing
up. Part of the liquor in the car was
saved, however, which they brought
to town with them, and which kept
them pretty well tanked up during
the hearing before the Magistrate.
Mr. Noel was the only one of the
party who suffered injury in the col?
lision with the rock at Joe Crockett's.
The left side of his face was badly
bruised and a part of his car was cut
cff. Dr. Crockett dressed the wound
in his office Saturday night.
Mr. Bailey, the driver and owner of
the car. acted as counsel at the hear?
ing, and if his clients had taken the
advice offered them, they might not
be fncing a term on the county ronds.
Several of the men were insulting to
the trial justice and jeered and made
light of the procedure.
The practice of disregarding the
speed laws of the county is going to
be broken up and Bluefield drivers
lind better take notice of this fact.

invited guests nt the banquet.
AS TO GILES JACKSON.
Quite a hue and cry is ruised by
the Republicans as to Giles Jackson
coming to the Ninth district to speak
in the interest of Mr. Trinkle. Re?
publican speakers are trying to drag
this incident into the enmpaign to
prejudice voters against the Demo?
cratic ticket, notwithstanding Jack?
son's positive denial, over his own sig?
nature, that he ever had any such
intention, or was even ever solicited
to speak here, either for Mr. Trin?
kle or against Mr. Slemp.
We do not know how the report
started that Jackson was coming, nor
do we care. If Jnckson chose to come
to the Ninth district to sneak of his
own accord, he had a perfect right to
do so. Jackson is an honorable negro
and stands well in Richmond among
his own people as well as among the
white people. He is far and away
ahead of the negro for whom the late
Col. Slemp, then member of the leg
' islature, voted for for door keeper
against Sullivan, a one-legged Con
! federate soldier, which act of Col.
Slcmp's was approved by the Repub?
licans. Tho Republicans who are ex?
ploiting the Jackson incident are
straining out a gnat?an imaginary
gnat at that?and yet previously swal?
lowed a camel.
TAZEWELL, VIRG
ALL ABOARD FOR
SHAWVERS MILL!
N. & W. Has Made So Much Mon?
ey Under Four Years of Dem?
ocracy That New Road Will
Be Built Up Clear Fork.
Our friends living on Clear Kork
are to be congratulated upon the re?
port that the Norfolk & Western has
begun the survey of the new line to
traverse that section. The proposed
road will run from the New River &
Holston's road, a subsidiary of the
N. t? W., in Bland county, and connect
with the Clinch Valley at either North
Tazewell or Burke's Garden Siding.
The Bluefield Telegraph of last Sun?
day had the following account of the
beginning of the survey:
Norfolk & Western engineers
started a survey Thursday morning
from Rocky Gap. Va., to North Taze?
well for a twenty-nine mile extension
of the New River Holston and West?
ern Railway, a subsidiary line of the
Norfolk and Western.
Ascording to advices reaching here
relative to the extension of the line,
the engineers will make a survey of
two routes. The first survey will be
made from Rocky Gap, up Wolf Creek
to Clear Fork and then to North
Tazewell. intersecting the Clinch Val?
ley division at that point. The sec?
ond route will be made from Hicks
villo, up Wolf Creek via Grapcfleld,
striking Clear Fork at Craotrce's
Gap, and then to North Tazewell. It
is not fully determined as to which
place the new extension will tap the
Clinch Valley district. It is said,
however, that the line will either con?
nect with the Clinch Valley at Peery's
or at North Tazewell. ,
It is pointed out that the road can
be built on u water grade by either
route, but by building the line from
Ilioksvillc it will be necessary to tun?
nel Rich Mountain nt Crabtree Gap. i
People of Bland county state that i
.he road is assured, und it is expect
sd that construction will start early
a the coming spring. The extension i
if this road will not only open a
arge timber area, but will be a di
ect route for all coal from Southwest 1
Virginia. I

TRANSFER OF REV. MR. WOLFE
(From Princeton Correspondence in
(The Bluefield Telegraph.)
Rev. J. E. Wolfe, transferred from
the pastorate of the Methodist Epis?
copal church here to the presiding el?
dership of the Tazewell district,, left
the city yesterday for his new field.
Mrs. Wolfe, left from Bluefield for
the Craig Healing Springs to spend
some time.
Not n few were the expressions of
regret at Rev. Mr. Wolfe's leaving the
city. Not only was he beloved by the
people of his charge, but he had en
deared himself to the citizenship gen?
erally, but all alike felt highly grat?
ified at the responsible position as?
signed him. He will have under his
care no fewer thnn twenty pastoral
charges, meaning a responsibility that
goes to reflect the enviable confidence
the conference imposed in him.
The Methodist chueh here during
his pastorate met its benevolent obli
?nations every year, and plans had been
aunched to enlarge the church edifice
for the accommodation of the growing
Sunday school attendance, amounting
to nearly 990. In fact the excavating
for the work is under way and a
goodly sum of money had been rnised
to apply to the cost of it. This last
I year the sum of ?6,000 was rnised to
lift the rcmcaining indebtedness on
the magnificent new place of worship
and the parsonage. In addition to
this, his charge made the East Princ
ton people the gift of a lot as a site
fo a church building of their own.
At the same time manifesting its gen?
erosity in imparting to the East
Princeton church forty of its mem?
bership. Through this brotherly sup?
port the church nas been built and has
since proved a success. '
? ?**?*??*?
It is interesting to note that Rev.
Mr. Wolfe succeeds Rev. Mr. Hurley
as presiding elder of the Tazewell
district, .Mr. Hurley having in recent
years been pastor of the church here.
Mr. Hurley becomes presiding elder
'of the Raclford district.
I IN I A, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20,
BOTETOURT IS FLOURISHING.
The Senior Editor Returns From An?
nual Trip to Old Home.
The Senior editor of this paper has
returned from u two weeks visit of
busincsss and pleasure combined to
the old home neighborhood in Bote
tourt county. He had a great trip.
Everywhere were evidences of unprec?
edented prosperity. Business, road
building, schools and churches?ev?
erything is on a healthy boom.. In
he old home neighborhood, near Boi?
tins, the boys were busy gathering
and ship'Mii"- apples, sowing wheat,
hauling tan-bark, adding to and paint?
ing their new school buildings, and
all of them "binning new moves for
the future. As to politics, they are
not troubling themselves. They all
seem satisfied that President Wilson
will be re-elected and said, "he is
good enough, let well enough alone."
They all expressed themselves as
hapnv in the great prosperity which
their community, along with the en?
tire United States, is now enjoying,
und can see no reason for risking a
change at this time, but every reason
why they should not.
Roanoke a Busy City.
There is something doing in the
Magic City all the time. In nassing
through I ran up against three great
revivals?Baptist, Presbyterian, and
United Brethren. A great religious
wave seemed spreading over the city.
The Shrinora from all over the State
and visiting Shriners from other
states, invaded the city on Saturday,
the 14th, and literally took the town"
which was virtually turned over to
the boys. Buffalo Bill was there on
the preceding Saturday. The parade
held the town for more than an hour.
After leaving Roanoke for Norfolk, u
car or two of the train carrying the
show was wrecked, killing 22 horses
and scaring the Indians on the train
out of their wits.
I had the pleasure of meeting Jos.
Stras, Judge Stuart, Col. Browning,
J. Ran Henrv, Millard Stultz, Lane
Whitley, all former Tazewell citizens.
Professor Meadow and his wife, well
known music teachers. Prof. Coulter,
the young and enthusiastic President
uf the National Business College, and
other leading citizens of the cltv.
President Coulter took me through his
large school building and I saw the
students and teachers at work, and a
fine body?hundreds of them?they
seemed to be. I said to one man,
"Roanoke is a coming cty,." He re?
plied, "You're wrong. Roanoke has
iilready come. We will be. some day,
the largest city in the State."
Uncle 91 Years Old.
On Sundny, in company with a rel?
ative, A. S. Leslie. I visited an old
uncle, the onlv livinir brother of my
father's, who lives six miles south of
Roanoke. Be is in his 9-1 th year and
is hale and hearty. His mind is as
;lear as it ever was. But for an af?
fliction of total blindness he would be
[juito active. I had not seen him for
years, and was pleased to lind him
cheerful and nappy.
The extreme acres of this old veter?
an and also of his fnmily, is remark?
able and unusual. "Uncle Jim" is 04,
or nearly so. My father is 87, aunt.
Lizzie is 84. These three are all that's
left of a famil of 12?7 boys and 5
girls, only one of whom died under
70 years of ace. These facts may
not be of public interest, but are re?
corded here for those who may be
interested in such "gossip."
Should I live to make my 1017
"Annual," and I expect to, I will have
more to say of "the best people on
Barth,'' particularly and of the land
"where the skies are always bright,
and the sun forever shines." J. A. L.

Hurley. It was voted to send copies
of 'The Young Crusader" to the school
teachers in Tazewell High School, und

imous vote was passed to send Mrs.
O'Brien to the National convention at
Indianapolis, she being elected dele?
gate at large by the Virginia State

SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF LIME
IN TUB SOIL.
(By R. R. Wall, County Agent.)
At the present lime lime is being
used extensively over many parts of
the country with the idea of improving
crops. In most cases its use has re?
sulted in extremely economical in?
crease of crop yields. For tins rea?
son its use is increasing rapidly. This
in desirable, provided it is used intel?
ligently with tho proper tillage moth'
ods, rotations niul fertilizer treat?
ments, The relation of those things
to the use of lime will not bo discuss?
ed here. It is siifllcienl for the pres?
ent to stale that lime is not used
lor its value as a fertilizer as ninny
are disposed to think. Plants do use
Miinll amounts of lime na food, but
I here arc very few soils which do not
contain sufficient lime for what the
plant needs for food. The true bene?
fits of lime lo the soil and crop lire
not direct but indirect and ure childly
three in number. It is the purpose
of the writer to discuss two of those
briefly.
First to be considered is the uffocl
of lime upon the physical and me?
chanical condition of the soil. The
physical condition of the soil and its
texture are very important, as all
know, with reference to its suitabil?
ity for crops, lo stand wet. weather
or a drouth. In wet weather it. may
hold too much water, while in a drouth
it may not hold water properly. Some
clay soils tend to hold loo much wat?
er while sandy soils often lose water
too rapidly, either due lo drainage or
evaporation. These conditions an
modi Mod by the use of lime. The par?
ticles of clay which arc very line un?
bound logctncr, mnktng the soil more
open, pnrUS, and less likely to bake,
easier to work and more suitable for
the growth of plants because plant
toots need air .mil ventilation. No
doubt, the render has observed the
line effects of lime upon the crops
and texture of the soil when applied
to heavy clay fields. On the other
hand, the loose sand grains are bound
together and made to bold more mois?
ture. Since sandy soils seldom got too
wet unless poorly under drained, this
is a very des!ruble effect.
I.hue makes the soil "sweet," and
this condition is necessary for the
growth of many of the beneficial soil
bacteria. As'many know certain bac?
teria live on decaying plants in the
soil, decomposing and changing them
so that they may be used by plants
for food. The process by which this
takes place is known as nitrification,
and for it lo take place rapidly the
presence of lime is very necessary.
Another kind of beneficial bacteria
which work best in a sweet soil are
those which live on the roofs of leg?
umes, such as clover, alfalfa and soy
beans. The good work of these bac?
teria can not be taken up here in de?
tail, but it is sufficient to say thai
they gather nitrogen from the soil
air and store it in the tuberoles or
nodules which the farmer has so of-1
ten seen on the roots of legumes.
These nodules form an excellent
plant food and take the place of cer?
tain fertilizers which would otherwise
have to he bought. The growth of
some bacteria is checked by lime, an
example being the disease known as
club root of cabbage.

National Organ of W. C. T. U.
Makes Kind Reference to the
Hospitality of Tazewell and
Her People.
Under thi? heading, "Virginia's Con
vontion in tin- 'Grcat-llenrted" South?
west Section," the Union Signal, the
National organ of the W. C. T. U.,
had the following to say of the re?
cent convention here:
"As prophecied by those who had
been there, the beautiful little moun?
tain town of Tazewell made the thir?
ty-fourth annual convention a glor?
ious success, helpful and happy.
"Itecnuse of the expense and dis?
tance, (he hostess town being on one
side of the State and not far from
Virginia's long base line, the attend?
ance, I-It) delegates, far exceeded ex?
pectations. With the exception of
the local members all delegates had
to puss through West Virginia's east?
ern gateway, Blueiield. a growing,
prosperous city, where the success of
prohibition is everywhere upparrent.
"Tazewell has beautiful homes and
the town sergeant hail the streets
clean and shining, und also helped in
the general decorations. Ilotsy Ross
would have rejoiced in the handsome
display of Hags in the business sec?
tion, in the schools and in the now
opera house, where the evening sess?
ions were held. An arch, bearing the
words, "Welcome, W. C. T. U.," spann?
ed the main street. The Tazewell
white ribbonors and the community
gave their best in splendid hospitali?
ty mid spared no effort for the com?
fort of their guests. Meeting in n
section utcd for" its rich bhicgrass
farms, yet where the work of the Wo?
man's Christian Temperance Union
is comparatively new, the response
lo calls for state work, subscriptions
to papers, evening collcctirns and
other similar needs was unprecedent?
ed generous und cheering. Kleven
hundred copies of the forthcoming
stale report were ordered and paid for
The receipts at the medal contest, al?
though I lie evening was rainy and
admission low, were more than $52,
showing thul nearly a third of (ho
I "(HI townsmen had been present.
"The convent ion mot in the Pres?
byterian church, beautifully decorat?
ed for (he occasion. The rooms for
(he executive committee in the Luth?
eran church across the street hud
llowers, W. C. T. U. mottoes und well
dusted (aides und seals. Well train?
ed musicians of local note, with the
musical director. Miss BoWOII, 118
llislillg, und violin und other soloists,
from liluelield, nearby, made (he mu?
sic a splendid feature of (he conven
ion. The editor of the Clinch Val?
ley News sent n copy of his paper
..ith interesting summitry of conven?
tion news lo each delegate the other
local journal appearing loo late for
i he same courtesy,
A note of tine sympathy was heard
in the fraternal greetings from the
women's societies. Many visitors from
i he town and section expressed pleas?
ure at the conduct of the business
meetings and astonishment ut. the wide
scope cd' work accomplished. New
members were gained, ami crowds
poured in for the evening sessions.
The pint form was ablaze with light,
polled plants, and (lags were every?
where, the national motto being well
lo I he front in the color line. One
hundred children look part, in the
cantata, "An Anneal lo Uncle Sam,"
and the applause was spontaneous
und tremendous. Jubilee night show?
ed n long line of women who under?
took short speech making. Welcome
jS'igbt proved thnt no convention ever
exceeded Tazewell men in eloquence
ami the words of the women who had
planned faithfully and happily were
rich and varied and reached the
hearts of all who heard. The response
was given by Mrs. William J. May
bi.I' Richmond in worthy and grace?
ful tone. The entire convention was
pleased with the state president's
ability in presiding and the review of
temperance work in her annual ad?
dress was a delight. A matron's con?
test and a lantern lecture were lis?
tened to on the closing evening by a
crowned house.
**********
"It was generally recognized that
the work among the voung people had
taken fresh start. The march of the
local presidents in which about sev?
enty-five took part, revealed this
awakening in new legions, Young
People's Branches and more school
worK. Twenty-live children received
white ribbons and certificates through
Mrs. Maybee, the Superintendent of
.Mothers' Meetings and White Ribbon
Recruits. The local editor paid the
organization a high tribute when he
said: "Our home people will feel a
grenter interest in the work of the
W. C. T. U." As for the visitors,
delightful and grateful, could they
love Tazewell more?"
MRS. HAMILTON INJURED.
Is Wife, of Man Who Disappeared
Prom Graham Many Years Ago.
Mrs. Hamilton, visiting Mrs. Sluss,
was seriously injured last Friday in
a runaway accident. The horse at?
tached to her buggy became unmana
gable and the buggy was overturn?
ed. No bones were broken, but she
was much shaken up. Mrs. Hamilton
lives at McDowell, W. Va., with her
daughter Mrs. Devinney. She is about
70 years of age, and the accident is
the more serious on that account. At
last reports she was better.
It will be recalled, that some years
ago, a Mr. Hamilton left Graham to
walk tc Bland county where he own?
ed a farpi He w*& never heard of af?
terwards.
Sonic years later the bones of n hu?
man skeleton were found .n Ike moun?
tains, which were supposed to be those
of the missing man, and that he was
probably murdered, as he was known
to have had money on his person
when he left Graham. Others sup?
posed that he was taken ill on the
way, wnndorcd from the road, and
died. This tragedy, if tragedy it was,
is recnllcd by the visit of his widow
to this section, and the accident which
jmight have caused her death.
