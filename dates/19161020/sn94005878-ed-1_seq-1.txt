change in the policy pur.-ui-d by them
in censoring American mails, restor
tig to the I nlted States ' its full right

his government.
Warning also was given that the
l.'nlleil States regards the right of
neutrals as sacred as those ol bellig
erents, and "can no longer tolerate
the wrongs which citizens of . the
L'niled States have suffered and con
tinue to suffer through these uieth
ods."
In a joint memorandum dated Feb.
, Cn-at Britain and Frame an
nounced that "true to their engage
ments," they "would continue for the
present from seizing and confiscating"
"correspondence" muil, the inviola
bility of which they admitted. The
second American protest complained,
among other things, that, while re
fraining from making these seizures
on the high sea, the allies had torced
neutral steamers to enter their ports,
thus "acquiring by force or unjustifi
able means an Illegal jurisdiction."
Instead of conceding that the meth
ods complained of "were lawless,' the
allies stoutly assert that the censor
ship is being maintained in accord
ance with the rules of international
law.
They don't concede that they have
no legal right to make seizures of mail
on the high seas and Justify the tak
ing of neutral steamers into British
ports on the ground that tnis is done
solely for the purpose of expediting
(he examination of the mails, in order
that "innocent" correspondence may
be sent forth with as little delay as
possible.
