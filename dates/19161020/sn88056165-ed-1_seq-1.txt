GOVERNOR HELD
ROUSING MEETING
Voters Traveled Many Miles
to Hear Chief Executive Ex
plain State Business Trans
actions.
The large Orpl eum theatre
was filled to overflowing Tuesday
to hear Governor Alexander,
people having come from fifteen
to twenty miles, and some much
farther, to hear the chief execu
tive of the state give an account
of his stewardship during the
past two years. The meeting
opened after the Ferdinand band
had played several selections on
the street and in the hall, and
Hon. E. L. Parker of this place,
democratic candidate for lieuten
ant governor, made a short ad
dress. Governor Alexander was
then introduced and spoke for
almost two hours, holding the
close attention of the large audi
ence until the end.
The governor opened his speech
with a glowing tribute to Presi
dent Wilson and spoke of the
many difficulties that have con
fronted him since he took the
chair in the white house. He
said that the president had kept
us out of war at a time when the
entire world seemed to be war
mad and in spite of the enormous
pressure brought from all sides
to push our country into war. He
pointed to the great and priceless
peace that we are enjoying and
the prosperity of our nation and
joy and happiness in the most
humble homes in the land, and
said that had any other man than
Woodrow Wilson occupied .the
presidental chair during the past
two years our nation would now
be engaged in war and our young
men filling the trenches over in
war-cursed Europe, a condition
that may yet occur unless Presi
dent Wilson is returned to office
next month.
He spoke of the many acts of
beneficial legislation that have
been * enacted into law under
democratic administration, point
ing particularly to the federal re
serve banking law which pre
vents all future panics, the child
labor law which prevents child
ren under sixteen years of age
being employed in factory or
mine, the federal good roads law
which appropriates 85 millions of
dollars within the next few years
to build suitable highways
throughout our country, and last
but not least, the rural credits
law. This measure is classed as
one of the greatest acts of con
structive legislation enacted in
centuries and is the only law
passed that benefits the farmer
alone. It is claimed this law,
when once in force, will save the
farmers of the United States one
hundred and fifty millions of
dollars annually in interest
charges alone.
Coming down to state matters
the governor spoke at length on
how business of the state had
been handled in the past and the
cost of doing business had in
increased with almost every ad
ministration. He told of how
the lower house two years ago
had passed an appropriation bill
of two million dollars and he had
succeeded in getting it reduced
by half a million before it was
finally passed, and had made still
further reductions by vetoing
many unnecessary appropriation
bills. He spoke of the Allen de
falcations and how the state in
vestigation had placed the total
shortage at some $93,000 and
wanted to let it rest at that but
he had gone to the bottom of the
matter and finally caused the
bonding company to pay back to
i
the state a total of $154,000. He
spoke of the Coffin attempt to
graft $14,000 from the state for
attorney fees when he was never
employed fon such purpose and
how this had been headed off and
would be defeated. He referred
to his carrying the case to the
state supreme court and forcing
the big irrigation companies of
south Idaho to deliver water for
irrigation purposes to the starv
ing settlers on some of the tracts,
thereby establishing the fact that
the waters of the state belong to
the people of the state and not to
the large corporations.
The governor told of how he
had been opposed at every turn
by the professional politicians
and office seekers but had gone
his way and did the best within
his power and judgment for the
taxpayers of the state and that
his meanest enemy would not say
he had not been governor in
every sense of the word while he
had occupied the chair.
The governor was listened to
with closest attention throughout
his discourse and was frequently
applauded when making some
telling point. His meeting was
one of the largest ever held here
and the audience was composed
of members of all political parties.
The meeting closed after W.
B. Hussman, candidate for repre
sentative, had made a few re
marks, and as the crowd dis
persed expressions could be
heard on every side commending
the statements of the governor
and expressing faith in him as
the man to fill the chair for the
next two years.
From this place Governor
Alexander went to Vollmer and
Nezperce, where he held en
thusiastic meetings. He returned
to Grangeville for a rousing
meeting last night and left this
morning for the northern part of
the state where he will complete
his itinerary.

State Surveyors Near Town
Engineer Burns, who has
charge of the work of completing
the location of the north and
south state highway across
Camas prairie to the Lewis coun
ty line, is now camped with his
crew of men at the Goeckner
farm northeast of town, having
moved camp to that place the
fore part of the week. The state
surveying crew completed the lo
cation of the road up from White
bird to the prairie last week.
The old route up Chapman creek
was abandoned as being entirely
unfeasible and a new route was
secured around the Tolo point
near the Soderburg place. After
passing the lake the road swung
west and then north for four
miles on the present county road
between the towns of Denver
and Fenn. It then swung in a
northwesterly direction through
the low passes to near the Eckert
place and the work of surveying
this last lap has been in progress
this week. It is the intention of
the surveying party to run the
line on through the Ferdinand
country to a crossing of Lawyer's
canyon near the big railroad
bridge but it is impossible at this
time to say whether the state
highway commission will desig
nate this route as the final loca
tion for the road or not. As the
present survey runs the road will
pass from two to three miles east
of Cottonwood and is said to miss
Grangeville an equal distance.
Directness of route, cheapness
of construction, reduction of
grades and serving the largest
number of people in the county
traversed are the points con
sidered by the surveyors and
state board in locating the road
and, while each locality would
like much to have the road run
past their front door, it is im
possible to satisfy all and is
better to have such a road trav
ersing our country than to be
forced to get along for future
years as we have in the past

failed to come for breakfast.
Hotaling was 23 years of age

had arrested a crippled brother of
Stevens and a man named Weeks.

Minnis shot as Stevens ap
proached them. The officers
were later placed under arrest
and are being held pending an in
vestigation. The officers claim
an attempt was being made to
mob them when the shooting
took place.

Darling Lecture Was Great
If the first number of the Red
path Lyceum Bureau eburae is
any criterion of the succeeding
numbers the people of this local
ity can congratulate themselves
on securing some of the best en
tertainment available for the
coming winter months. The
opening number of the course
was a lecture by Nela Darling,
which was delivered Wednesday
evening at the Orpheum. The
house was well filled for the occa
sion and to say that all got full
value for their money is putting
it mildly. Mr. Darling is an ac
complished talker and decidedly
witty and kept his audienee con
vulsed with laughter during the
entire lecture. He spoke first
upon economic matters nationally
and then came down to the treat
ment of local conditions in the
community and the way he
handed out short arm jabs to both
townsmen and farmers was a
sight to hear. He played no fav
orites and presented naked facts
in a way to cause his hearers to
view local matters and conditions
in an entirely new light While
some of his statements may have
been overdrawn, they in most
cases hit near the mark and his
visit here is almost certain to
prove of material benefit to all
who heard him.
The second number of the
course, The American Quartet,
will appear here on Thursday
evening of next week and will
undoubtedly draw a crowded
house. The quartet will furnish
music after the entertainment
for a three-hour dance at the
Odd Fellow hall
