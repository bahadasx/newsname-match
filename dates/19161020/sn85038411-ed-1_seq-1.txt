Who Did Shooting
While attempting to arrest two Southern negroes this morning
for trespassing on the Pennsylvania Railroad tracks just west of
Wormleysburg, one special railroad officer was murdered and another
fatally shot.
Special Officer John L. Beisser, aged 36, of Lemoyne, was shot
through the heart and died almost immediately. Harry C. Chubb,
aged 33, of 1024 Market street, also a railroad officer, was shot just
over the heart, and through the left leg. He is in the Harrisburg
Hospital in a dying condition.
Archie Miller, aged 24, of Charles
ton, S. C., and Joseph Fletcher, aged
17, of Gainesville. Fla., are under ar-1
rest charged with the murder. T. 'H.!
Fenlcle, of Marysvllle, brakeman on I
the Pennsylvania railroad, saw the 1
shooting, and he organized a posse to I
chase the negroes who were captured !
along the Susquehanna river nearl
West Fairvlew.
The mob was armed with shotguns,
gfc bricks and clubs, and railroad offl
• cera from Harrisburg with difficulty
prevented a lynching. They rushed
the two negroes to Harrisburg police
headquarters.
When Chubb was brought to the
hospital, the negroes were taken there
and the railroad officer said that
Miller did the shooting. When ques
tioned at headquarters. Miller ad
mitted that he had shot several times,
but declared that he did not know
whether he had killed anyone.
Both men admitted that they were
armed with .45 caliber Colt revolvers,
but said that they threw them away
when the mob closed in on them.
Squire P. C. Coble of Wormlevsburg,
who aided in the capture saw Miller
and Fletcher trying to hide in the
bushes along the river.
Officers Rush to Scene
Railroad officers from Harrisburg
as soon as they learned of the murder,
Jumped into an automobile and rushed
to West Fairview. just in time to pre
vent any violence. Those in the ma
chine who brought Miller and Fletcher
to Harrisburg. were Captain Paul L.
Barclay, Lieutenant Edwin J. Oran
ford, and Officers James Morrissey, Jr.,
and Augustus H. Haines.
According to Fenicle, who was with
his train. Officers Beisser and Chubb
■walked up to the negroes and asked
them to stop. Miller pulled out his
revolver and fired, according to the
brakeman. Both of the officers drop
ped, and Miller and Fletcher fled.
Members of the crew blew the whistle
of the train to attract the attention of
the people in the neighborhood, and
Fenlcle rushed Into tho town and
gTabbed a shotgun, spreading the
news as he ran. The posse started in
a few minutes, and after a short
chase located and held both the
negroes.
At police headquarters Miller de
clared that he and Fletcher Just ar
rived here to-day from the West. He
said that after leaving the South, they
went to Buffalo, then west to Chicago,
and were on their way to Jersey City.
Both admitted that they carried re
volvers, but declared that they did
so for protection. Miller told the offi
cers that he and Fletcher were about
to leave on a freight train this morn-

Identified neither made any statement.

tified Dr. J. H. Deardorf, of Mechan
iesburg,coroner of Cumberland county,

the inquest, but a formal charge of
murder will probably be preferred at
once against Miller.
Hospital physicians late this after
noon were making every effort possi
ble to save Officer Chubb's life. Miller
and Fletcher will probably be turned
over to the Cumberland county au
thorities to be held pending the action
of Coroner Deardorf.
Crowds Follow Auto
An angry mob of railroaders and
citizens followed the automobile that
brought the colored men to Harris
burg. No effort was made to collect
bridge tolls at the west end of the
bridge. The big crowd rushed through
the gate and kept close to tho auto.
Railroad police who had been call
ed out to aid in searching for the ne
groes were lined up at the bridge en
trance, and several were on the bridge.
Fearing that the mob would get hold
of the prisoners they ran along with
the crowd, keeping everybody away
from the automobile.
Once when the auto slowed up on
the bridge the crowd caught up.
There were some ugly words used by
some of those In the crowd, but no
effort was made to interfere with tho
officers In charge of the colored men.
Southern Xegroes a Menace
Residents of the city and nearby
towns are greatly alarmed because of
the outbreak of serious crimes In
which Southern negroes are the load
ers.

tention of the people was In Juno

city police force, was murdered at the
Market street subway. Elwood Wilson

groes, are Jail awaiting trial charg

MANY NEWSPAPERS MAY
HAVE TO SUSPEND BECAUSE
OF NEWS PRINT FAMINE
New York, Oct. 20.—1n a careful
statement regarding the news print
situation —the paper upon which news
papers are printed—G. F. Steele, sec
retary of the News Print Manufac
turers' Association, says the bottom of i
the reserve supply of news print has I
been reached. He declares that the ;
only remedy to bring the demand i
within the limit of the mills is to re- |
duce the size of advertisements, in- j
crease rates and economize in every
direction in the consumption of paper, j
| No hope is held out of any improve
ment and Mr. Steele agrees with other i
experts familtar with conditions that
many newspapers will fall by the way- i
side. There has been no increased pro- j
duction of news print and prices will
continue to soar. Weak publications
cannot stand the Increase.

Deficient Gasoline Pumps
Mulch Motorists of Millions
Washington, D. C.. Oct. 20. Short
measuring gasoline pumps, according to
an investigation by the Federal Bureau
of Standards, are mulcting motorists of
millions of dollars a year. In Illinois
alone the loss Is not less than $500,000
a year. Tests In many cities have con
firmed previous conclusions, and actual
tests of the types of pumps used by
retailers at the bureau here have
| shown 80 per cent, of them to give
■short measure for various reasons. Some
of them are susceptible to manlpula
| tlon by the dealer.
j "This tendency toward deficient
measurement," says an announcement
! by the bureau, "Is worthv of careful
1 consideration, as it results in the ag
gregate In enormous monetary losses to
i the public.
"It is safe to say that in all localities
not under an efficient and competent
weights and measures administration
and in a large majority of those which
do have a relatively competent adminis
tration. til* condition of measuring
numps Is such that the motoring public
Is being subjected to regular and con
tinuous shortages In Its purchase of
gasoline."
