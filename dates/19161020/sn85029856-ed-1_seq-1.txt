SHOULD HAVE MORE ROOM
The crowded condition of Liberal.
schools has been a troublesome prob
lem for some time to both the board
of education and the parents of the
, pupils. At times the different school
buildings have been so crowded that
doing justice to each pupil was al
most an impossibility. When the city
-went into the second class it became
automatically authorized to erect a
school building in each ward if the
necessity was apparent and bonds
were voted for that purpose. This
has been done to the extent of a new
school building in the west part of
town and the construction of the
same will proceed In the near future.
However, the site purchased does not
consist of quite half a block, and for
that reason the space for the building
and grounds is entirely inadequate.
Enough room should be provided on
every school ground for play grounds
and the erection of apparatus that go
-with the same, as it is dangerous for
them to run about on streets over
-which automobiles or other vehicles
do very much travelling. A half a
block will not suffice for this purpose,
-and an entire block should be secured
for the location before the building
is started. We do not want to ad
vise the board of education in their
duties, have no real estate to sell
them, and will get no commission if
another deal is made, but we under
stand a proposition has- been made
them whereby an entire block can be
-secured for this purpose without any
additional cost, and we sincerely hope
the school fathers will give the mat
ter due consideration before work on
-the new building is started. A whole
llock would be large enough for a
.sood sized building, give plenty of
room for play purposes, and leave
enough for an addition to the school
In the future should conditions Justi
fy the same. Liberal Is growing by
leaps and bounds and no one can tell
at this time how fast the school
hulldlngs will have to be added to
in order to accommodate the increase
3n " aUendanM-t-s'wli -tealook
ahead and lay broad plana for the
future, and the provision fpr plenty
of room would be an Important item
In planning the erection of new
school buildings.
MADE AN EARLY MORNING RUN
,t ., The Are department was called out
about S o'clock Mtinday morning to
extinguish a small blaze in the barn
flt W. M. Black, Who lives in the
northeast part of town. The Are is
thought to have started from a light
ed clgaret or cigar stub left by some
one who had occupied the hay as a
ted during the early part of the
night. A little hay destroyed and a
small hole burned in the aid of the
"barn constituted all the .damage sustained.
Jay Redd came up from Hooker
Monday to accept a position In the

and we hope he will like his new job
when he gets onto the ropes thoroughly.

VlKK AT LIBERAL BAKERY , -"
Fire broke out in the baking de
partment of the Liberal Bakery yes
terday morning about 6 o'clock and
for a time things looked very serious.
It seems that some of the mortar be
tween the bricks had dropped out and
the flames shot through and touched
the celling. The Are was first noticed I
by the reflection on a nearby building.
The alarm was promptly turned In
and the fire fighting equipment got
there in short order. The roof is j
covered with sheet iron and it was a !
big. job to chop a way to the fire.j
but it was soon done and the fire ex
tlnguished. Considering the heavy
wind yesterday morning, had the de
partment not been so prompt In get
ting to the scene of action we might
have had a bigger fire to tell about
this week. Much praise is again due
the fire department for showing up
so promptly and getting such quick
action on the fire. The loss to build-
ing and contents will be about $400
C. M. Light made a business trip
to Hutchinson and Wichita this week.

ODD FELLOWS GO TO KISMET
A bunch of the local Odd Fellows
piled into cars Wednesday evening
and went to Kismet to help Institute
a new lodge at that place and initiate
a class of 29 new members Into the
"chain gang." The weather was
warm when they left Liberal and they
didn't anticipate the change of tern
perature that took place before they
returned. As a result most of them
have been sticking around the stoves
and trying to thaw out ever since.
Those who attended from here were
H. W. Lane, Tom Horton, Joe Elliott,
J. B. Skinner, Frank Ong, Frank Gal
loway, A. B. Mitchell, T. V. Symon, J.
D. Pearce, J. B. Hubbart, Joe Ru
dolph, John Eden, R. W. Dickerson,
A. B. Fullmer, E. D. Cooper, A. C,
Bumgarner, R. H. Malone, and sev
eral others whose names we failed to
learn. They report the new lodge
starting off with over 40 charter
members, which ought to make them
one of the good lodges of the state in
a short time, if that ratio can be
maintained. Barring the cold weath
er,' the boys report an excellent time
at the institution.
MARRIED
A marriage license was Issued last
week to Clifford B. Voiles of Wood
ward, Oklahoma, and Miss Bess
Fletcher of Guymon. They were
married by Rev. D. G. MacLennan ot
the Presbyterian church.
Ellsworth E. Allen and Eva E. Gib
son, both of Stontngton, Colorado,
were married by Judge Campbell at
his office Saturday.
Judge Campbell married G. W.
Miller and Miss Maude Millsap, both

court house Monday.
' MR,' DOEKfl WILL. BE HERE
A. A. Doerr of Lamed, democratic
nominee for state senator, will spend
at least one day In Seward county be
lore election aay. Mr. Doerr was
minority leader in the last session of
the Kansas legislature and made a
record In that capacity that won for
him the warmest commendation from
his opponents as well as members of
his own party. He Is that rare com
bination a successful business man
who has not evaded his duty when
called on to serve his district politi
cally. He owns the largest business
in Lamed, it not In the entire district,
and Is also a large land owner and
farmer. Mr. Doerr's republican op
ponent is "Billy" Glenn, an attorney
at Tribune and the local attorney at
that point for the Missouri Pacific
railroad. Liberal has several citi
zens who were former neighbors of
Mr. Doerr's and they speak of him in
the highest terms. Announcement ot
his coming will be made In this paper.
E. D. Cooper transacted business
matters In Meade Tuesday.
FREE CITY DELIVERY DEO. 1
The free delivery of mall in the
city will be Inaugurated on Decem
ber 1, according to Information re
ceived by Postmaster Irwin, the first
of the week. Two carriers will be
employed to start with, and one sub
stitute. The salary will be $800 per
year the first year, and we presume
It will be raised from time to time
at the pleasure of the postofflce de
partment. Full information can be
obtained regarding the civil service '
examination necessary to get the job
of mail carrier, from the local post
master. The examination will be held
some time next month, announcement
of which will be made through these
columns in a subsequent issue. There
will be two deliveries ot mail per day,
one at 8:00 a. m., and one about 2.30
p. m., or whenever the mall from No.
1 Is received. As yet there are a
number of houses in the city that
bear no number. No house without
a number will be served by the mall
carrier and it behooves the owner
or renter to get busy and find out
what his number Is and then tack it
on in a conspicuous portion ot tne
house. Liberal is getting more like
a city every day, and free mail de
livery is another step In that direction.
NUTll lS TO THE I'lULiUJ
I will give $25 reward for the ar
rest and conviction ot bootleggers
anywhere about the premises of the
Carson House, provided they are not
turned loose on th epublic again. For
any plain drunk that Is arrested and
fined, and the fine paid either in cash
or worked out on the itreet, I will
give $2.50. i
If society as a whole has failed to
clear the streets of these peats, what
can a rooming house proprietor do
except fight, and that Is against the
law. s
I wish to say to the public, if I live
th patrons of the Carson House will
be protected from the roughs and
tourhs of society, and l( I die vou can
say: "Well done, thou good and
faithful servant." ,
Respectfully, v
