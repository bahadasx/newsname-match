Worth Careful Thought
Do you read tho label to know whether
your baking powder is made from cream'
of tartar or, on the other hand, from alum
or phosphate?
Royal Baking Powder is mado from
cream of tartar, derived from grapes, and
adds to the food only wholesomo qualities.
Other baking powders contain alum or
phosphate, both of mineral origin, and
used as substitutes for cream of tartar
because of their cheapness.
Kever sacrifice quality and healthful
ness for low price,

Which Will The
Public Believe?
The liquor organizations, thru
liberal purchaso o f advertis
ing space iu newspapers which
have not yet freed themselves
from liquor domination, are try
ing to fool the puhlic iuto believ
ing that prohibition is a failure
from every point of view. Espec
ially are they attacking the law in
the newer prohibition states, even
in their desperation quoting 21-year-old
newspaber arricles to
bolster up their arguments. Their
mis-3tatemeutp, however, are so
fligrant that they are overreach
ing themselves. The advertise
ment claiming "increase of ar
rests" in. Denver, fqr, example, is
flitly contradicted by tho facts as
tet forth by Deuver officials. May
or Speer is well known as a
friend of the wets, yet, says
tha Denver Express, he "has
been startled at prohibition's ef
fect in decreasing crime "Safety
Manager Bailey (quoting turther
from the Express) said "that he
had been convinced of prohibi
tion's benefits through the jail
reports. The county jail used to
bouse from 200 to 2G0 prison
ers daily ; it now houses one-third
that number. The city j Ail used
to house about 100 prisoners a
night; it now harbors about ouo
tenth that number. There were
71 prisoners iu tho couuty jail
Thursday and 18 in the city jail.
"The two officials believe that if
liquor can be entrely eliminated
from the city, crime will be re
duced to a surprisingly low min
imum."
Quarterly Meeting

The first quarterly meeting of
tho conference year will be heid
at the M. E. Church, South,
Monday night. Rev. J. A. Good
son, of Dixon, presiding elder,
will be iu- tho city in time to
preach Sunday night.
REVIVAL DOING
MUCH GOOD
Large crowds are attending the re
vival in pi ogress at the M. E. church
and much interest is being manifest
ed. The church is being strengthen
ed and there has been one conversion.
Kev. J. L. Burton is preaching some
powerful sermons.
National Flag.
Each of tho sturs la tho flag stands
for a state. Tho 13 red and whlto
stripes represent the original "Old
Thirteen" states. It Is said thut John
Paul Jones was tho first to fly tho
flag on tho ocean. But, llko most ev
ery other question of any couscqucnco,
this Is a subject of dispute.
The Knocker
Ever community has him, ev.
cry community cupsos him, and
evory community tolerates him.
He is usually an unsuccessful
business man whoso objection
abla ways have bson tho direct
cuuso of his losing in tho game
of life. He must needs vont his
st'l.ehousomeono or some thing.
Admitting no fault in himself,
ergo, the fault must be in his en
vironment. .hence ho knocks.
Ho is a pestiferous cuss, and
as littlo as we ma believe it, he
really does harm.
He is sure to get tho ear of
many new men in town and pours
into their ers his abuse of the
place. According to him condi
tions are all crosswise. The bus
iness men tiro cheats and swin-
tiers. Tho professional men are
quacks and shysters. To, his way
if thinking thero isn't a decent
i. nechanic in the placo. Even the
i.tborers are lazy and trilling.
The town is dead and is no place
for a live man to tarry. His
soured soul fairly writhes and
squirms with sardonic joy when
he sees that his miasmatic mouth
ings are having their intended
effect upon tho victim. That is
tho knocker that is his story,
his way.
If there is a public enterprise
planned that needs cooperation
aud united effort he is immed
iately possessed of a superior
wisdom and begins with glee to
point out all of the weak spots.
No calculations can by any pos
sibility work out as Intended.
Men upon whom the enterprise
depends will prove weak or
traitors. Tho plans are all
wrong. Tho whole thing is a
piece of stupendous folly, aud he
for one will have nothing to do
with it.
But what a pity he will nott
That would be all the community
would ask of him and his mouth.
And thus it gees on year after
year.
Does it have any effect, you
ask? It certainly does. The bus
iness life of a community, con
trary to the .opinions of many, is
susceptible to influence from ad
verse critics. Perhaps not half
of his hearers know tho real
cause of his pessimistic knock
ings, and in many minds a doubt
lingere and things that should go
with a rush are unaccountably
slow and lagging.
But, what, say you, can we do
with him?
May we make n suggestion?
Every time this insect opens his
mouth to knock tell him plainly
that there are quite a number of
roads leading away from the
town, and cordially invito him
to take ono of them and follow
it to its end.
And let ovory loyal citizen of
tho town givo him the same ad
vice. Local Chapter

CALOMEL SALIVATES
AND MARES YOU SICK,
Acts Like Dynamite on a
Sluggish Liver and You
Lose a Day's Work
There's no reason why a per- .
son should take sickening, sali
vating, calomel, when 50 cents
buys a large bottle of Dodson'a
Liver Tone a perfect substitute,
for calomel.
It isjleasant, vegetable liquid
which will start your liver just as
surely as calomel, but it dosen't
make you sick aud can not sali
vate. Children aud grown folks can
take Dodson'a Liver Tone, bo
causo it is perfectly harmless.
Calomel is a dangorous drug..
It is mercury aud attacks your
bones. Take a dose of nasty cal
omel today and you will feel
weak, sick and nauseated tomor -row.
Don't lose a day's work.
Take a spoonful of Dodson's Liv
er Tone instead and you will
wake up feeling great. No mora
biliousness, constipaiiou, slug
gishness, headache, coated tonguo
or sour stomach. Your druggist
says if you dou't find Dodson'a
Liver Tono acts better than horl
riblo calomel your money is wait
iugfor you.
