CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY. MONTANA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1916.
Two Dollars Per Year
Many Changes are
Planned by G. N.
Proper Drainage, Elevated
Walk From Station
Officials Say
F. D. Kelsey, General Super
intendentof the Great Northern,
and his assistant, W. R. Smith,
were here Wednesday evening,
inspecting the local properties
and ths addition to the round
house, now nearing completion.
The officials, soon after their
arrival, extended an invitation
to Mayor Potter and members
of the Council to visit with them
and discuss improvements in
Cut Bank, of concern to the res
idents of this city.
They talked very freely in
regard to local improvements,
declaring that a number of rec
ommendations for needed
changes at this terminal had
been made and would doubtless
be acted upon soon. The mo.vt
urgent, the drainage of their
property on the south side of
the tracks, adjacent to their ho
tel, would be made just as soon
as the piping arrived. Concern
ing a petition recently forward
ed from here relating to the con
struction of an elevated cross
ing over the tracks, between
the city proper and the station,
they stated that this matter
would be acted upon at an early
date and something done to
minimize the risk assumed by
pedestrians under present con
ditions. Many other contem
plated changes and improve
ments were discussed, most im
portant being the enlargement
of the yards, the moving of the
coal chute and water tanks
down toward the roundhouse
and the locating of a new depot
on this side of the tracks. These
changes mav not come at once,
but they wiil sur ly come, they
declared.
It is something new to have
railway officials break down
the barrier of reticence and
talk so freely of their plans.
Those who listened to the plans
for future improvements here
felt satisfied that the Grtat
Northern considers Cut Banken
important point and a city with
a substantial future.
The labor situation was the
worst drawback at present, the
officials stated. Skilled or un
skilled labor is very hard to
secure.
Don't forget
his evening.

thought, accompanied by'Knights, Nobles, Pages, Court
Jesters and Deserving Democrats.
ACT II. The boss calls upon the Court Jesters to pro
vide merriment for the assembled guests. The Printer's
Devil of the Royal Journal, who is also Chief Jester,reads
the following original poem:
Himself Boss Busey walked into his den,
And he summoned his vassals all,
Saying, "Ho Varlets! bring me my trusty pen
And my ink-pot filled with gall.
A strong editorial I must now write,
That will not appear like a joker
I'm going to say in a serious wav,
That Bill Miller has banished poker.
ACT. III. Loud laughter from the nobility and De
serving Democrats and beaming nod from Boss Busey. A
second jester suggests that a statue of Billy Miller, per
sonifying Purity and Civic Virtue, be unveiled. Guests

A Model Club
The closing of all the saloons j
in Oregon by vote ot the people
has resulted in some remarkable ■
transformations in Portland, the
largest Citv of the State.
Among others, the change of
Fred Fritz' place into a "poor
man's club" is among the most
interesting.
Mr. Fritz ran one of the
largest saloons in the West.
With the coming of prohibition,
he changed it over into "Fitz*
Great Workingman's Resort."
Thousands patronize its various
departments daily, and seem to
enjoy themselves fully as well
as when liquor was sold. There
are eight thousand feet of floor
space in the main lobby alone.
Motion pictures are exhibited
without charge and there are
free reading rooms. Other
features ar^ baths, lunch coun
ters, a restaurant, an employ
ment office, a soft drink bar. and
a lodging house. In fact, the
place is a great club run at
reasonable prices.
Mr. Fitz takes great pride in
it. and declares that it is much
more satisfactory to do business
with sober men. Here seems
to be an ideal poor man's club,
and without the feature of in
toxicating drinks that inakes^
the poor man poorer. The en
periment shows that the much
vaunted poor man's club does
not have to go out with the
saloon. The club may stay and
be successful as a club, when
the saloon feature has gone.

EMPTY PHRASES INSTEAD
OF CONCRETE ACTION.
Not once has President Wilson
squarely placed before the Am
erican people the questicn which
Abraham Lincoln put before the
American people in 1860; what
is our duty? Not once has he
appealed to moral idealism, to
the stern enthusiasm of strong
men for the right. On the con
trary, he has employed every
elocutionary device to lull to
sleep our sense of duty, to make
us content with words instead
of deeds, to make our moral
idealism and enthusiasm evap
orate in empty phrases instead
of being reduced to concrete
action.—From the speech of Col.
TheTStiore Roosevelt, delivered at
Lewiston, Maine, in behalf of
Charles E. Hughes.
Telling Tariff Points
Let these telling points on tariff
and protection in the speech by
Charles Evans Hughes, thp Repuhli
can candidate for President, delivered
In the Salt Laid; Tabernacle, be Äed
permanently in your mind and
memory during the remainder of the
campaign :
We are desirous of having strong
and sure the foundations of our na
tional greatness in this pursuit of
competition among the nations which
is sure to follow the cessation of
the present struggle.
1 presume that the Republican party
as the national party, according to
the constitution of the United States,
within the national sphere, shall pro
ceed wherever it Is practicable, to
build up and foster and encourage
American enterprise, and open the
doors wide for honest American
achievement.
Then came the Underwood tariff
bill itself. What was the result? En
terprlse halted and there was a con
traction of trade throughout the land,
and America, instead of going ahead,
stopped. That Is what happened
Three hundred thousand were unem
ployed in the City of New York
There was not a citji In this land
where the Jobless man anxious anil
able to work did not walk the streeL
They were fed lié' our charitable or
ganlzatlons, which were taxed to the
utmost limit to provide for those for
whom American enterprise could no
longer make provision. It was a sad
spectacle.. Americans have not for
gotten it. It Is not forgotten here
or anywhere. It cannot be forgotten,
It Is too recent.
If you are going to have the basis
for prosperity In this country ; if you
are going to protect the American
wage scale ; if you are going to have
American enterprise able to. meet the
competition which will follow the end
Ing of this war, you must have an
honestly devised, wisely framed tariff
law to protect American Industry,

Many Turn Out To
Hear the Beauty
Mrs. Milholland Puts Punch
In Brief Speech At
Station
Gallant men and fair women
of Cut Bank assembled at the
railway s t a t i o n on Satur
day afternoon last to listen to
a platform speech on the nation
al suffrage situation, by Mrs.
Inez Milholland Boissevain, a
Vassar graduate, noted lawyer
and sulfrage leader. The little
lady stepped jauntily from the
platform and without formality
began "putting across" a strong
appeal to Cut Bank voters. Mrs.
Milholland didn't tell the good
ladies here that Wilson was the
"mothers' candidate" nor did
she "thank gawd" for democ
racy. She told them that dem
ocracy had toyed with and pal
avered fair woman but had ob
structed every attempt to push
the cause of sulfrage. She said
she was not campaigning for
the republican party, but that
the republicans had promised to
aid in passing the federal suff
rage amendment, therefore the
women, in their battle for the
right to vote and for a better
day in politics, should aid the
party that came out boldly in
their behalf.
As to Mrs. Boissevain's par
ticular style of beauty, there
was some variance of opin
ion. Not a Vew ladies were seen
to turn up their noses and heard
to remark that she wasn't so
"awful purty." Several senti
mental young men were yelling
"votes for women" when the
train pulled out and one or two
married men were heard to de
clare that the lady was no bet
ter looking than their o \y n
wives.
Big Grain Yields
Reports of some very large
wheat and llax yields came in
this week from the sections
north, east and south of Cut
Bank. A large wheat field on
the Bennie Berger ranch yield
ed nearly 45 bushels of fine
wheat per acre. C. C. Camp
bell who was in from the
Marias country last Saturday,
reported a yield of 46 bushels of
wheat to tbe acre recently, in
the Icelander settlement near
the Marias. Swenson Bros., of
Pleasant Valley, threshed near
ly 45 bushels of wheat recently,
we learn from a neighbor.
Harold Seager, whose ranch is
near the Canadian border, re
ported that a neighbor had
threshed 20 bushels of flax to
the acre. Seager stated that
the frost did very little damage
in that section—not nearly as
much as in the wheat region
farther south.
Farmers are not doing much
bragging this year about their
yields— but 45 bushels of wheat
and 26 bushels of flax, at the
present skyrocketing prices,
should not be scoffed at, eh?
