UNDER CLEAR SKIES
Ideal Weather Forecast for
Game Tomorrow Mass
Meeting Tonight.
i C. L. BREWER TO TALK
Clyde Williams Also Will
Make Speech Music by
Ames Quartet.
The weather man has promised
practically all that could be desired of
him for the Missouri-Ames game to
morrow. He has given his word that
when the whistle blows at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon, the weather will
be fair and warmer, but not too warm
for the best efforts of the players. Of
ficials will be: referee. J. C. Grover;
umpire. E C. Quigley; headlinesman,
Dr. J. A. Reilly.
Rooters' quarters have been as
signed; the upper classmen to sec
tions G to H, and freshmen to sec
tion P.
Neither team has been defeated or
even scored on this season. In her
two games, Missouri has defeated
Central 40 to 0, and Washington 13 to
0. Ames has won from Teachers Col
lege 29 to 0, Highland Park 19 to 0
and Kansas 13 to 0.
Ames' defeat of Kansas last Satur
day makes the game of tomorrow
practically an elimination battle In the
Missouri Valley race. If the Tigers
can hold the Hawkeye men to a small
score tomorrow, they have the long
end of the chance in the Thanksgiving
game.
(The score of the Missouri-Ames
game last year was: Ames 14, Mis
souri 6.

Notes of the Delegates
Mrs. S. L. Garrard is one of those
delegates who come to the State Fed
eration meeting "just to see what good
they could get out of it" according to
her own statement She is interested
in everything that women's clubs do
and she likes Columbia too well to
stay away. She represents the Wom
en's Midweek Club of Centralia.
Mrs. James C. Welch of Elsberry
was in Columbia last Farmers' Week,
as she Is especially interested in home
economics. She says that many Mis
souri women are working for the erec
tion of a building for the home eco
nomics department at the University
and for a Women's Building. One of
the things which she hopes this fed
eration meeting will accomplish Is
the crystallization of sentiment for
better conditions for the women here,
and Incidentally for all Missouri wom
en. She is a delegate from the Els
berry History Club.
Moberly sent many delegates'to the
convention, according to the usual
Moberly spirit, as one womanr said.
Miss Nell Lynch is from the Round
Table Club and Mrs. Will Sanderson is
a representative of the Sorosis Club.
They declared that they are interested
in everything, and the enthusiasm
with which they made the statement
was worth a volume of comment on
women's clubs.
One sentiment voiced by many of
the visitors was, "I .love Columbia."
No one said it more emphatically than
Mrs. ,W, H. Logan of the Fortnightly
Club of Laddonia. Mrs. Logan has
three daughters in the University and
has visited Columbia many times, and
likes It better each time- Mrs. A, L.
Brutin Is another delegate from the
same club, and she, too, is visiting a
daughter who is a University stu
dent iMrs. C. G. Daniel, president of the
Cosmos Club. Mrs. R. L. Alford and
Mrs. McCune are all delegates from
Vandalia. Mrs. Alford is especially
interested in child welfare work and
las visited Columbia several Umes in
the interest of "Better Babies" cam
paigns Mrs. W. R. Chlwis of St Louis,
state president, and Mrs. Eugenia
Rutherford of Moberly. district presi
dent will be entertained at the home
of President A. Ross HHI-during their
stay in Columbia.
Coming to Columbia seems very
much like coming home to Mrs. J. D.

running board and tried to clamber
over the door. He was grasped by
secret service men and pushed Into
the street Jumping quickly, he
caught the. step and attempted to re
peat his efforts. Forced backward,
into the crowd and pulled by persons
in the street he fell down.
Before several, who jumped for

he was up and off like a shot City
detectives caught him after short
chase.
The Cullen family physician, Dr.
Barklay, later in the afternoon de
clared that Cullen is deranged.
