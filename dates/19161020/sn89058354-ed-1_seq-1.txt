This Season's Crop Estimated
At About 1,600,000 Pounds
Quality Good
PRICE HAS ADVANCED FROM
5 14 TO 7 CENTS A POUND
Deliveries For Past Month
' Break All Previous
Records
The heavy deliveries of cotton
to the gin for the past thirty
- days has not lessened during the
, past week. The best of weather
conditions for the picking and
" hauling of the large cotton crop,
together with the high price be
ing paid for cotton, is the cause
s of the unprecedented deliveries
this season.
The season opened more than
a month ago with cotton selling
at 5 14 cents, and the price has
steadily climbed until it has now
reached 7 cents. The open
ing price was the best that has
been paid for many years and a
large amount of cotton was de
livered at thia price.
.Up to the present time more
- than 800,000 pounds of cotton
has been delivered to the gin in
V. this city, 150,000 pounds of this
. . amount was delivered during the
past week. 64,000 pounds was
sold, here last Saturday. 342
bales have been put up by the
local gin this season.
The amount of cotton already
delivered is estimated to be
about one-half of the crop in this
county.
The tobacco market is showing
Bigns of activity as the dealers
' and contractors are making prep
arations for the handling of this
year's crop. The Henry county
Droduction this vear is estimated
to be about 25 per cent more
.than previous years, or more
; than 8,000,000 pounds. Indica
tion are that priras will be bet-
ter than for the past few years,
but as the market is still un
steady it is impossible to state
with any degree of certainty
what will be offered.
ZANFRETTA FAMILY WITH
" HOWE'S LONDON SHOWS
. a
There are many novel acts
with the Great London Shows
which are certain to be well re
ceived in every city lucky enough
to secure a visit from the consol
idated enterprises. There are
acts which were never seen in
America until this show opened
its Beason of 1916 for the reason
that there was no amusement
enterprise great enough to af
ford the large salaries which the
artists demand and no institu
tion with sufficient prestige to
attract the attention of such cel
ebrated performers.

SUNDAY SCHOOL TEAM
Sunday was indeed a red letter
day at old Lebanon church be
tween Puryear and Crossland. It
was the occasion of James W.
Stewarts District Sunday School
Convention (Non Sectarian) in
which representatives of all
churches and Sunday Schools
united. .
As a part of the preparations
for the day, Jas. Stewart had
sent some hands and lumber and
had erected a long table under
tho great oaks hoary with age
that stand about the old church.
Early Sunday morning from
every direction there was seen
people in automobiles, buggies,
wagons and on foot wending
their way to the "all day dinner
on the gronnd" meeting.
The old and the young, the
rich and the poor, met together
as of old, and God was- the
father of them all, and it seemed
on that special occasion the
Great Father was very near, for
there was universal good will
and perfect order among them
all, and a kindly disposition
toward each by the other.
None of us can know, but may
it not be so that the spirits of
such men as John H. Witt, Jas.
G. Smotherman, Jas. Dunn.
Richard Newton, Finney Stewart,
Thos. and Robt. Lemons, the
elder Moores, Atkins, Hills,
Martin, Warnicks, Ma this,
Mooneys, Provines, and may be
others whose names are not now
recalled who in iormer years
met at this consecrated place for
worship. May they not have in
some way been manifest though
unseen in the great audience
that met this beautiful October
Sabbath under the giant oaks
and in the house of God to speak
oi the common t atner, to wor
ship together, to commune with
HON. JAS. B. FRAZIER
T
Defends Wilson's Administra
tion and Pleads For Sup- ,
port of Nominees
Hon. James B. Frazier, speak
ing in the interest of the Demo
cratic ticket, addressed a repre
sentative audience in this "city
Tuesday afternoon. He spoke in
the circuit court room. Attorney
Frank E. Bryant presented Mr.
Frazier who was greeted with
applause as he rose to speak.
Mr. Frazier paid a high tri
bute to the Democratic adminis
tration, and appealed for support
for the entire ticket from Wilson
on down. He reviewed the
Democratic record and cited
facts as reasons for its continua
tion in power. -
He made convincing state
ments on the federal reserve
system, rural credit system,
preparedness measures, eight
hour law, good roads law and
income tax law. Mr. Frazier
having served in the United
States Senate is familiar with
the questions of national impor
tance, and presented them to his
hearers in a logical manner.
His tributes to President W
son met with hearty applause.
as did his allusions to fanner
Republican administrations. He
criticised Mr. Hughes severely
for his methods of campaigning
and dodging of issues.
All in all, Mr. Frazier's speech
was well delivered and well re
ceived. It was not so much
suggestive of oratory, but more
of hard, logical facts, presented
with, a force that pleased and
convinced his hearers.
TOBACCO BARN BURNS
A tobacco barn belonging to A.
Hartsfield, of the Spring Hill
neighborhood, was destroyed by
hre Tuesday night. The Darn
contained a five-acre crop of to
bacco, which was partially in
sured. one another, and to lay plans for
the betterment of the young
people and children of the Sun
day school? Do not good deeds
and influences live on and on
and like the grain wheat dying,
yet reproducing itself some
thirty some sixty and even an
hundred fold?
The meeting was in all respects
success, the entertainment
first class,, and the speeches
good.
Jas. W. Stewart is a man
among men, kindly, generous
deeply pious without the least
ostentation or self assertion but
modest almost to a fault He is
together with his amiable wife
and family reflecting credit on
his distinguished father, Finney
Stewart and carrying on his
work.
The significance of the long
table erected alluded to above
has no doubt been anticipated
It was to accommodate the
guests at one of the most lavish
spreads of good things to eat
that this scribe has seen in a long
time. There was everything to
eat, and it looked like everybody
was there to eat it, and such a
time as they had! but they could
not. destroy the supply which
was much more equal to the
demand.
ine speakers on the program
present, were Rev. Davis, Rev
Gray, Mrs. John Bumpass, and
Messrn. Zimmerman, Rev. Han

Lieut. J. D. Weldon Writes In
teresting Letter From
Eagle Pass.
The First Tennessee infantry,
the First and Fifth Maryland,
the Third and Thirtieth regulars,
the Third and Thirtieth regulars,
one squadron of regular artillery,
one squadron regular cavalry,
two engineer companies and the
signal corps, Maryland field hos
pital, etc., came in Friday after
noon from a seven-day hike to
Spofford and return. They were
tired and dirty, but happy. The
last day in they marched sixteen
miles. The officers are all well
pleased with the manner in
which the maneuvers were car
ried out and the efficiency of the
men.
It was truly a trip through a
country destitute of food and
water, which made it yery hard
on the men but an experience of
great value from amilitrry point
of view as it gave them an idea
of what real war would be like.
The men stood the trip well, es
pecially the First . Tennessee
boys, who could not be beaten in
a great many respects. They
were quick to get into action,
took cover well and maintained
their military bearing and discip
line at all times.
The Tennesseans were strictly

populatioTrrTShkes and cussing. They aver-
agjjfabout twenty-five snakes to
the company per day, with a lot
of skunks, horned toads, etc.,
thrown in for good measure.
We Tennessee boys did not
d the hike so bad, but, oh,
mja the water was scarce, , but
wjrat do we care as we expect to
e paid tomorrow, and Eagle
Pass is an ocean for wetness.
Nobody goes thirsty there!
Gen. Frederick W. Sibley,

will assume command of the dis
