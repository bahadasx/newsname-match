%ii: Washington, D. C., Oct 19—Loss of
the German submarine merchantman
Bremen virtually was considered to
day by ranking diplomats in position
to be familiar with the movements of
the "vessel. The Bremen is now one
month overdue.
It was admitted that German offi
cials, not only in this country but in
Berlin were without information as to
the fate of the Bremen. All they
know is that she set out for America
from Bremerhaven and that she
should have arrived at an American
port soon after the middle of last
month. It is regarded^ as doubtful that
accurate information concerning the
fate of the vessel will be available un
til after the close of the war, if then.
The disappearance of the Bremen
will not cause abandonment of the
project to send merchant submarines
regularly from .Germany to the United
States, It was said. There appeared
to be reason to expect that another
submarine sea freighter either the
Deutschland or some other, would
reach an American port some time
Iwitbin the next month.
German officials in Washington do
not believe the Bremen could have
fallen into the hands of the British un
less "he had some accident to her ma
ehinery. They pointed out that unlike
naval submarines, merchant subma
rines avoid all localities frequented
by shipping and therefore are not op
en to the same iftks. When the Bre
men was a week overdue no anxiety
over her was felt.
When the vessel was two weeks
overdue anxiety was apparent in var
ious Teutonic quarters. Since then
hope that the submarine might be safe
has dwindled each day and today she
Was spoken of as having been lost
Reports that the Bremen had ar
rived safely In New London, Conn.,
were published in newspapers in Ger
many more than two weeks ago. It
wis at New London that a dock had
been specially arranged for the recep
tion of the craft
The Bremen was commanded by
Captain Schwarzkopf and carried a
crew 'of approximately twenty-live
men.
£2 WAR SUMMARY. '0^M
The Rumanians have checked the
Teutonic allies all along their border
and at several, points have repulsed
1
•3
attacks of the Austro-Gennan forces,
inflicting heavy losses.
In Galicla severe fighting is still in
progress between the Russians and
Germane.
The French have made gains north
and south of the Somme. Over a mile
front south of the river between La
Maisonette and Biaches, the German
first line defences have been driven
back by the French. The British have
made gains east of Thlepval.
The Italians have taken another
step forwaird in their advance in Tren
tino, having broken the Austrian line.
The situation in Greece still re
mains tense on account of the landing
of marines of the entente allies at
Athens and Piraeus.
SEE NEW TROUBLE.
Petrograd, Oct. 18.—Via London,
Oct. 19.—(Delayed)—The Novoe
Vremya. reviewing the German-Amer
ican situation and voicing the general
view here, concludes:
"A clear renewal of submarine war
fare cannot be regarded by the United
States otherwise than a sufficient
cause for a rupture of diplomatic re
lations with Germany."
MISSIONARIES SAFE.
New York, Oct 19.—American mis
sionaries at Hamadan and Kerman

bad been felt, are safe and well pro
vided for, according to a cable mes
sage from the American embassy at
Constantinople, received by the board
of foreign missions of the Presbyter

Berlin, Oct. 19.—(By wireless to Say

day made public the following:
"Constantinople reports received
here say that the Greek newspapers
have printed a letter written by
Damanos, Greek patriarch of Jerusa

patriarch says the Greek church,
which owing to the war, had fallen in
to a precarious financial state,
addressed an appeal for aid to DJemal

"DJemal obtained from the Turkish

which is to be increased later on, and

GERMAN PRISONERS AND BRITISH
FIGHTERS SEEM TO HAVE
8AME OPINION.
(Copyright 1916 by Associated Press.)
British Front in France, Oct. 18 (via
London), Oct. 19—The war will last
another year, according to the consen
sus of opinion among the British sol
diers and their leaders. It is also the
opinion of the Germans, if the view
of the prisoners count for anything.
Before the grand offensive started a
high authority informed the corres
pondent of the Associated Press that
the German line would not be broken
this summer and that slow operations
wearing down the Germans would be
inaugurated and would probably last
through another summer. With the
approach of winter, conditions may
make military movements difficult
This officer recalled his prediction and
Bpeaking of the situation today he
said:
"We know what the German re
sources were and what ours were and
the time required to force a decisive
victory for our arms is a matter of
calculation." T:
Germans Change Belief.
German prisoners taken during the
summer invariably spoke of peace be
ing a certainty in the autumn. They
regarded the Somme thrust as a final
effort of the allies or a decision and
that after it peace would be made.
Their tone has been entirely different
of late. They recognize that it is a
fight to the finish between man power
and resources of two foes and that
an ultimate decision will come from
the fearful attrition on the western
front which now will know no inter
mission until the end. The Germans
are determined to make every village
on the western front a fortress which
will yield only when reduced to pow
der by shell fire and every gulley and
crater a machine gun post to secure
their defensive against a crittical de
feat.
At a period when the weather is ad
verse to offensive operations else
where the Germans are apparently
concentrating every possible man and
gun against Rumania. The view of
the British officers is that the Ger
mans hope to crush Rumania so that
when they have to face a common al
lied offensive in the spring they may
not have to defend the immense length
of the Rumanian frontier in addition
to what they have had to defend this
summer.
Morale Is Varied.
It is a universal remark among the
British that never has the morale of
the prisoners varied more than now.
"You will notice that we are always
taking prisoners and that the Ger
mans get very gew of ours" said a staff
officers. "Though small parties of our
men are bound to get into hazardous
positions they die rather than yield.
This shows their morale and the tem
per of the situation. Some Germans
have never fought better and some
have never fought so badly as in the
last few weeks. Today, for example,
twenty Germans practically threw up
their hands and walked into the Brit
ish lines. But there were other Ger
mans who were ready to fight with
that ferocity which expects no quar
ter."
However, whether it is a German
who throws up his hands on the ap
proach of a British charge or the sur
vivor of a score who fought to the
death the opinion as to the duration
of the struggle remains the Bame. All
believe that the war has entered a
stage where no compromise is to be
expected and where victory will go to
the side with the ability to stick the
longest
SOLDIERS TO VOTE
Attorney General Of State Rules That
Old Law of Civil War Days
Holds Good Now.
Des Moines, Oct. 19. —Iowa troops
on the Mexican border will be allowed
to vote under a decision handed down
by Attorney General George Cosson
and made public at noon today. The
decision declares that the law passed
during the civil war permitting Iowa
Boldiers In the union army to vote still
is valid and in force.
Governor Clarke said today he would
appoint four commissioners to go to
the border and take the vote of the
Iowa troops. He said the appointments
probably would be made at once and
that a non-partisan commission, con
sisting of two democrats and two re
publicans would be chosen. The gover
nor added that the commissioners
would be sent to the border about a
week before election day in order to
permit them to make all necessary ar
rangements for the casting of the bal-.
lots.
As soon as the decision of the de
partment of Justice on the old law was
known. Secretary of State W. S. Al
len got Into communication with vir
tually every county In the state to ar
range with the county auditors for the
printing of the ballots It was expect
ed that virtually every county will have
to send a ballot containing the names
of the county candidates to the border.
Because of the short time remaining
before the election the county auditors
have been requested to send their
county tickets to the secretary of
state. The ballots will be prepared in
Des Moines.
The votes of the guardsmen will add
approximately 4,500 votes to the total
Iowa vote.

WILSON POLICY
GALLED GRAVEN
Col. Roosevelt Makes Attack
on President for His
Foreign Dealings
Louisville, Ky., Oct. 19 —In a speech
before a big audience last night, Col.
Roosevelt took President Wilson to
task on his foreign policies, condemn
ed the "craven" submission of the ad
ministration in the crimes perpetrat
ed upon the American people and
charged that the president is insincere
in his statements and protestations to
the public and to the world at large.
Excerpts from his speech follow:
At the outset of my speech I wish
to point out as I have elsewhere point
ed out, that the doctrine now often
advanced as to the impropriety of
criticising the president, without any
regard as to whether the criticism is
or is not just, has no warrant either
in history or on grounds of public mor
ality. Andrew Jackson in a message
to the senate on April 15, 1834, put the
case exactly as it should be put He
said:
"The president is accountable at the
bar of public opinion for every act of
his administration. Subject only to
the restraints of truth and Justice, the
free people of the United States have
the undoubted right, as individuals or
collectively, orally or In writing,, at
such times and In such language and
form as they may think proper, to dis
cuss his official conduct and express
and promulgate their opinions con
cerning it."
This lays down the law that should
be followed. There must be truth and
justice in all that is said of the presi
dent or of any one else but less than
any one other man In the nation has
he the right to claim immunity from
any criticism that is both just and
truthful.
Ii
criticise President Wilson
because his deeds have belled his
words, and bis words have belled one
another.
President Wilson's speeches are
models of adroit indirect suggestion
and avoidance of downright statement.
But the other day at Omaha he seems
to have committed himself to the state
ment, that he was "willing to fight"
but was "waiting for something worth
fighting for," for something which
would "put all the corpuscles of bis
blood into shouting shape." It would
be interesting to know exactly what
outrage on American citizens, or on
the rights of humanity anywhere,
which would make him cross the line
between being "willing to fight" and
"too proud to fight." He certainly did
not regard the treacherous murder of
Boyd and Adair, and this United States
as "something worth flghtlng-for." He
did not even write a note about it.
The murder of 1,394 men, women, and
children on the Lusltania did not "put
all the corpuscles of his blood Into
shouting shape."

EDITORSPREDICT
HUGHES VICTORY
Washington, D. C„ Oct 19.—Reports
received by the republican publicity
association from 1,200 editors scat
tered throughout the country Indicate
a sweeping victory for Mr. Hughes
in the election on November 7.
In a statement issued last night,
based on these reports, ex-Senator
Bourne of Oregon stated that Hughes
will carry every northern state. In ad
dition he has an excellent chance to
win Maryland and Kentucky. Large
gains will be made by the republicans
in Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina
and Oklahoma, according to Mr.
Bourne.
"Many democratic prognosticators,"
he said, "put Ohio, New York, Illinois,
and Missouri in the debatable column,
but unless the editors from whom we
have received our reports are badly
fooled, these states are safely republic
can and will participate in the land
slide which will culminate In over
whelming republican victory.
EPISCOPALIANS TO
REVISE PRAYER BOOK
St. Louis, Mo.. Oct. 19.—Line by line
the 612 clergymen and laymen com
posing the house of deputies of the
general convention of the Protestant
Episcopal church today went over
their prayer books in an attempt to
revise and enrich It to meet demands
for a greater freedom in the service.
The house met as a committee of the
whole to consider the report of the
commission on the prayer book. The
proposed changes in the main are
technical. One proposal is to change
the word "damnation" in several col
lects to "condemnation."
A step toward simplification of
church service was taken when ap
pointment of a committee to draft a
simple manual of church service for
use in parishes in which there are
numbers of unlettered and foreign
born persons, was announced in the
house of deputies. The house of bish
ops has before it a proposal to pro
hibit remarriage In the church of
divorced persons which was rejected
last week by the house of deputies.

OTTUMWA COURIER, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1916
TELLS WHY HUGHES
SHOULD BE ELECTED
FORMER 8ENATOR AND NOTED
PROGRESSIVE LEADER SETS
FORTH REASON8.
Chicago," Oct. 19.—The republican
headquarters here today gave oat a
statement from former United States
Senator Joseph M. Dixon of Montana,
manager of the Roosevelt campaign In
1912. In the statement Senator Dixon
sets forth reasons why Charles E.
Hughes should be elected president of
the United States. The statement fol
lows:
"It is futile for the democrats to ex
pect to attract any perceptible propor
tion of the progressive voters of four
years ago. Mr. Hughes Is progressive
enough for all of us. The man who
successfully conducted the probe of the
Insurance scandal was amonog the
earliest of our genuine progressive
leaders.
"Mr. Hughes has never been aligned
with any elemdtit In the republican
party that could be considered re
actionary. His entire course during
his public career has been along pro
gressive lines and In the furtherance
of doctrines .that are purely progres
sive. He earned the confidence and
esteem of the progressive element of
both parties during his administra
tion as governor of New York. He
made the Albany climate an unhealthy
one for the political blisses he
changed the old order of things com
pletely he attracted the combined
antagonism of the special interests
and those who had come to think,
through years of intrenched security,
that they were bigger than the law
and the constitution.
"Mr. Hughes' leadership In this cam
paign is really the harvest of the crop
sriwn by the progressives during the
past six years. His nomination is a
triumph for the progressive forces In
American politics. That Mr. Hughes
recognizes this fact is shown in the
personnel of his campaign committee
and the men chosen to direct the bat
tle this fall.
"Not even Mr. Hughes' enemies,
have dared to question his political
and personal Integrity. His elevation
to the supreme bench met with the
commendations of all good Americans
regardless of political affiliations. His
nomination for the presidency is a fine
illustration of the spirit xrf our times,
a spirit which commends and rewards
honesty, fearlessness and efficiency in
the public service: Without seeking
the nomination, without even author
izing others to seek it .for him, he be
came the choice of his party. By the
sheer force of his personality, his dis
tinguished public service and his In
difference to personal .ambition, he at
tracted all elements to his party. .No
machine, no combination of influential
leaders, no clique or faction promoted
his candidacy. It has been said and
with some measure of truth. "Nobody
wanted Hughes except the people."
"I have no hesitancy in predicting
that Montana will roll up a splendid
majority for Mr. Hughes."
HUGHES FOR PEACE
Republican Candidate Replies to the
.Charge That a Vote for Him
•J Is a Vote for War.
Saginaw. Mich., Oct 19.—Charles E.
Hughes delivered two speeches here
and at Bay City today before audi
ences that packed the halls where he
spoke. The nominee assailed the ad
ministration for the Underwood tariff
and the Adamson law and repeated
his denial of the charge that a vote
for him meant a vote for war.
"Men are going abroad in this land."
Mr. Hughes said, "saying that a vote
for me Is a vote for war, because I
have criticised weakness and vacilla
tion on the part of the administration.
A vote for me is a vote for perman
ent peace based on self respect and
the esteem and respect of others.
"Why I have devoted all my life to
the institutions of peace, institutions
that deal with a peaceful settlement
of controversies.
"But in this world, you have got to
maintain not only your security by
proper preparation against every
emergency but you have got to main
tain your security by winning the con
fidence and esteem of other nations.
We cannot do that if we do not main
tain the dignity of our own citizen
ship.
"If you want to know the way
things out to be done, look at the way
In which they were done in Mexico.
That, to my mind. Is an illustration
that stands out in bold relief of the
policies of this administration. It
was a meddling with matters that did
not concern us. It was a failure to
maintain American rights."
Mr. Hughes' train was fifteen min
utes~"late In leaving Bay City.
