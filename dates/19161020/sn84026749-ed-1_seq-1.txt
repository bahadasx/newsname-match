Declare They May Even Get Out
of Business Entirely Unless
Increase Comes.
With farmers threatening to call
a milk strike, or to give up produc
ing milk altogether, unless they get
better prices, Washington today is
facing a milk famine, according to
prominent producers and dairymen.
Already there is a serious short
age and dealers arc scouring the
surrounding country and in many
cases offering a premium in an ef
fort to get sufficient milk for their
trade.
One big distributer told a Times
reported today that he paid as high
as 40 cents a gallon for milk last
week.
COULDN'T GET MILK.
"And even at that we couldn't got the
milk wo needed," ho stated. "It Just
doesn't seem to be on the market and
the farmers don't seem to care whether
they produce milk or not.'"
In the past, It Is said, dealers have
been able to get sufficient milk from
New York, Pennsylvania, and other
sources In times of shortage. In the
Washington .market, to iuuilr tJte'rJ
trade, 'but this year, because of a gen

In their respective communities. They
agreed that tho situation Is serious.
With the prlco of mill feed and other
supplies necessary to the production of
milk Increasing each week, the farmers
are In a position whero they must get
more for their milk or go out of busi

Producers Lose.
Several large producers said that for
the last six months they have been
producing milk at a serious loss.
One shipper from Montgomery coun

have advertised the entire lot for sale.
This same feeling Is said to exist
among most of tho farmers In that
locality.
"Every Indication points to n further

Preparedness; Sees Menace

Striking Points in Speech
By New York Bank Head
"We need a moral prepar

things that are right."
"There has not been a new
stock issue for new railroad
work this year. Your busi
ness is without the confi
dence of investors. That is
a pretty sad outlook for the
biggest single business of
America."
"We have heard some
thing recently to the effect
that men cannot be subject
ed to involuntary servitude.
And you can't subject a free
dollar to involuntary servi
tude." "The United States is suf
fering from hardening of
the arteries. We have put
on our railroads such re
strictions that they have not
the resiliency to meet the de
mands on them."
"The politician who will
sell his executive judgment
