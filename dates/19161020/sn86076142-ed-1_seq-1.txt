(Br Aaaoclated Pma.) ' : t
Gradually the French are drawing their front closer to'Perottn
in Prance. After Wednesday ' advance along a mile front between
Biaches and La Maisonette west of the Somme, an attack launched
Thursday was rewarded with, further gains, which virtually bring
them to the bank of the stream. ,
North and east of Sailly-Saillesel, where the French : haw
advanced their line in the last few days, the Germans have made
a violent counter attack, which was repulsed by the French.
- Berlin admits that in their attacks on the Sars-Morval front th
British captured German positions, but says these were late r"
retaken. Except for a slight gain by the British at Butte-de-Warlencourt,
and the repulse of a German counter attack, com
parative quiet prevailed. ' .. '
No decisive result has been achieved in the violent fighting that"
haa been goipg on for several days in Volhynia , and Galioia.
Petrograd says that near Kiselin and Sviniusky in Volhynia attacks ,
by the Teutons were repulsed, while Berlin records the capture of
Russian trenches on the western bank of the Stokhod and . the
repulse with heavy casualties of Russian attacks near Bubunow.
South of Sborow, hi Galicia, several enterprises have? beea
carried out successfully by the Austrians, while at other points

BELGIAN RELIEF WORK

( Br Aaaoclated Preaa.) ;
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. Sugges
tions In England for curtailment of
the work of the Belgian relief com
mission because its supplies might
reach Belgians whose services had
been commandeered by Germany,
have been called unofficially to the
attention of tbe state department, but
the subject has not been taken up
diplomatically. "
The state department is anxious to
do all It can to prevent any misunder
standing which would cripple the
work of the commission, but it Is
realized that from the beginning the
status of the organization has been
extremely delicate, in that it stands
between 'two determined groups ot
belligerents. The possibility of an
unneutral act or of an act proving
unneutral has been so great that the
commission has acted with the most
extreme care.
The natural incompleteness of
English knowledge about what has
been transpiring In Belgium, and the
realization that Germany would en
force vigorously what she felt to be
her rights haa given rise to a con
