demanding heat. Consumers are pay
ing midwinter prices. A further ad
vance is promised.
Topeka coal dealers were flooded
with orders today. They have plenty
on hand to meet the immediate de
mand but cannot deliver it because of
the rush with which the orders are
being placed. When the temperature,

taking orders for todays delivery long
before noon today.
Thursday, dealers received scores of
orders in excess of what their equip
ment v ould deliver. When consumers
found this morning there was no gas
for h"ating they began ordering sup
plies fur the winter.
"I could sell 200 tons of coal today
in excess of what I am delivering, if I
could dfliver it." J. It. Billard, owner
of the Hillard mills and coal company
in North Topeka, said.
Prices of coal, while they are the
hi ir he ..t in years now, may go higher.
Today Topeka dealers quoted Osage
coal at $5 a ton: Burlingame. $4.75;
Arkansas anthracite, furnace ' size,
$9.50, and other sizes, $10.50: Pennsyl
vania anthracite. $13; Illinois, $7, and
some dealers reported they were out
of Pennsylvania anthracite and Illi
nois. The big demand is reported to
he on Osage and Kurlinsame. Semi
anthracite is quoted at $8 a ton. Last
year at this time it was selling for
.30 and $7, retail. The advance in
other grades of coal has been from 10
to 20 per cent.

Canton, O., Oct. 20. With echoes
of the greatest demonstrations ever
tetndered him still ringing in his ears.
President Wilson is returning home
today. He himself and all of his lieu
tenants are happy as a result of the'
Chicago visit,
"The greatest yet," Secretary Tu
multy said with unrestrained enthusi
asm. "An ovation from start to fin
ish. The women in this part of the
country are thoroly aroused to the is
sues of the campaign and they want
the president returned to office," was
the mesage sent out to Democratic
headquarters east and west.
There is no doubting now that the
president has embarked upon a deter-
I mined effort to bring out as the one
big issue of the campaign "a new na
tionalism" first forcibly set forth ir.
his Omaha address, and later ampli
fied in his Indianapolis speeches. Yes
terday the idea stood out in a further
exposition of this theme.
Unite Progressive Forces.
In the Press club speech he empha
sized the need of uniting the progres
sive forces to accomplish the purpose
of American business. In his second
address he urged co-operation of cap
ital and labor to serve the end which
he said must be served by the United
States, showing the world how to place
the cause of labor on a par with that
of the employers and the rights of hu
manity "above the rights of sover
eignty." Finally in his speech at the stock
yards pavilion last night, where he
was greeted by the greatest and most
demonstrative throng that has heard
him at any time since the campaign

and allegiance in a "triumphant illus
tration of the spirit of America in the
service of mankind."
Throws Aside Party Lines.
In this effort to unite the people
of the country for the purpose of ac
complishing the big task which, he
says, will face America when the war
is over, the president appears to have
thrown aside party lines In hia out and
out appeal to all "forward looking
progressives." He will continue the
same policy in speeches delivered
awav frm shadow Lawn during the
balance or the campaign, hinting only
at the dangers of ousting a power and
policy which has guided the nation
along a "certain known course," for a
power and policy whose course is "un
certain and unknown."
Today the president is again greet
ing Ohio and Pennsylvania crowds.
He will reach Shadow Lawn late to
night. Tomorrow he will celebrate
"Farmers' Day" at the autumn White
House and deliver a strictly political
speech from the veranda.

SAME 0LOST0RY!
Gas Pressure Was Far Below
Normal This Morning.
Barely Enough to Warm Up
Slow Breakfasts Today.
"USE TOO MUCH" TRELEAVEN
Manager Blames Consumption
of Jfew 50-Cent Luxury.
Pressure Only 20 Per (Dent of
Normal, 'Tis Admitted.
A well known scientist has said that
early rising is the salvation of the
health of the American public. Should
his assertion be true the health of To
peka is going to be saved, according
to indications, several times this win
ter, all because of the gas pressure.
The gas pressure in Topeka being only
one-fifth normal this morning, it took
the average housewife Just five times
as long to cook breakfast, necessitat
ing the rising of gas UHers just five
times earlier than the length of time
it takes to cook breakfast in
order to get to work on time. Truly
Topeka is going to get healthy if it
doesn't freeze itself to death doing It.
The first cold morning of the season
thai was this mornirir caught the
gas in Topeka trying to sneak out
thru the bottom of the grates instead
of thru the top. Anyway there wasn't
veiy much coming thru the top.
Housewives standing before gas stoves
wrapped in heavy winter coats, trying
to make coffee and fry an egg or two
were a common spectacle. The hus
bands generally added to the scene
by saying uncomplimentary .things
about the gas company.
It was admitted by the local gas
company today that the pressure this
morning about the time Topeka was
getting breakfast, was only 20 per
cei-t of normal." W. G. Treleaven, re
ceiver, stated that the low pressure
was due to the increased consumption.
"There is Just as much gas coming
into the city mains as usual," he said.
"More of it is being used and that's
what is cutting down the pressure.
People have been told not to depend
on gas for heating but they persist In
doing so."
In truth. Topeka shivered this
morning. There was little gas and
trouble didn't stop there. Coal com
panies are flooded with orders for
fuel and delivery will be delayed.

Roosevelt Tells Kansans
Wilson's Mexican Policy.
of
Kansas Should Resent Phrase,
"Kept Us Out of War."
Emporia, Kan., Oct. 20. Tho Em
poria had only short notice that Theo
dore Roosevelt would stop here and in
spite of the snow and strong wind, a
crowd was waiting at the station to
hear and see the colonel. Mr. Roose
velt spoke briefly to the crowd of citi
zens and students from the College of
Emporia and the Emporia Normal
school.
In speaking of the president's Mex
ican policy Colonel Roosevelt pointed
out that Kansas especially should re
sent the phrase, "He kept us out of
war." "If Abraham Lincoln had kept
us out of war there would have been
no free state of Kansas." said Mr.
Roosevelt. "If our forefathers had
believed in safety first there would
have been no United States today.
The phrase is nauseating to a patriot
acquainted with the history of our
country."
McKinley Loved Peace.
Colonel Roosevelt pointed out that
more Americans have been killed by
the Mexican bandits than were killed
by Spaniards when McKinley was
president. "William McKinley was a
peace-loving man, a. noble president,
said the speaker. "He didn't write
notes; he made war on Spain. Those
killed by Spanish bullets were men,
while those killed by Mexicans were
men, women ana cnuaren. xei pres
ident Wilson says we are too proud to

"The nation that is too proud tc
fight for justice will not get justice
from nations that are not too proud to
fight, just as the man who is too
proud to fight places himself in a
good position to get kicked," said Mr.
Roosevelt.

MYSTERIOUS MAN A CRANK
After Arrest He Denounces

In Scuffle to Overpower Him
Loaded Revolver Drops.
Pittsburg, Pa., Oct. 20. During the
president's ride about Pittsburg to
day a man carrying a black satchel
made determined efforts to jump on
the running board of the president's
car. He was finally overpowered and
hustled off to a station house by po
licemen. At the station house the man gave
the name of Richard Cullen. He is
a Pittsburger, 2 2 years old. When
questioned, he said that he was dis
satisfied with the president's handling
of European affairs, but did not ad
mit that he intended to attack the
president.
- In the satchel were found a long
bladed knife, several chisels and a bot
tle of liquid, which will be analyzed.
The clasp of the satchel was un
fastened. Believe Man Insane.
After examining the prisoner, the
police expressed the belief that Cullen
is insane and decided to hold him for
investigation. His conversation, at
first quiet in tone, soon became bit
ter and he roundly denounced the
president's policies.
Chased Cullen a Block.
Cullen leaped on the running board
end tried to clamber over the door.
He was grasped by a secret service
man riding with the president and
pushed into the street. Jumping up
quickly he caught the auto and dupli
cated his efforts. Forced backward !
by those in the car and pulled by per
sons in the crowd, he fell down. Be
fore several who jumped forward
could throw themselves upon him he
was up and off like a shot. City de
tectives headed him off when he had
run nearly half a block. Still holding
tightly the satchel, now gaping wide,
he submitted quietly to arrest.
The attack, occurred right in the
heart of the city,- at Fifth avenue and
Smith field street. The crowd there
was. very dense and the cars were
forced to move slowly.
- First Meeting in Months.
President Wilson and W. J. Bryan,
former secretary of state, met here to
day for the first time in months. The
president stopped at Pittsburg for an
hour and a half on the way from Chi
cago tto Long Branch, N. J., and Mr.
Bryan came here on the way to speak
at Johnstown, Pa.
As soon as the president arrived at
the station the former secretary of
state entered Mr. Wilson's private car
and the two shook hands. A largo
crowd outside witnessed the greeting.
The men spoke together only a mo
ment or two then left the car.
The appearance of Mr. Bryan
caused a five-minute delay in an au
tomobile tour of Pittsburg, arranged
for the president. Secretary Tumulty
and Mr. Bryan got in an automobile
together.
The president, Mrs. Wilson, Dem
ocratic Chairman Guffey and two sec
ret service men were in the president's
car. While the president's bodyguard
twice threw Cullen from the running
board the president remained very
calm. Airs. Wilson shared his appar
ent confidence that the secret service
would take care of the would be as
sailant. The crowd seemed slow to
grasp the situation.
Physician Says He Is Insane.
During thes cuffle between Cullen
and secret service men, a loaded re
volver fell into the street. Whether
the gun belonged to Cullen or the de
tectives, the police were unable to say
late this afternoon. Bystanders who
saw the revolver fall disagreed as to
who dropped it. Dr. Barclay, physi
cian of the Cullen family, declared
that Cullen is deranged.
PUTS ONE OVER POLICE
Mrs. Sanger Establishes Birth Control
Clinic and Cops Can't Find It
New York, Oct. 20. Mrs. Margaret
Sanger of this city, who was arrested
and convicted but not punished while
in Portland, Ore., recently, for advo
cating hirth control, announced today
that clinics for the dissemination of
information on that subject soon are
to open in San Francisco, Cleveland
and other western and inland cities.
The police here are searching for a
clinic which is being conducted in the
east New York section of Brooklyn
and which has been advertised by dis
tribution of hand bills in English,
Yiddish and Italian. The teaching of
birth control here Is a misdemeanor
under the law.
Mrs. Sanger said today she believed
the police would find the clinic in a
few days.
"We are prepared," she added, "not
in any aggressive or insolent way, but
dispassionately to fight the matter
thru air the courts in the state."
HONKS OF WILD
GEESE KEEP CITY
AWAKE ALL NIGHT
Jefferson City, Mo., Oct. 20. Many
thousands of wild geese, bewildered by
the electric lights of the city and the
penitentiary, kept nervous people from
sleeping last night. The first flights
appeared about 9 p. m. and toward
midnight the air was literally alive
with them. It was not until daylight
that the last flock found rest on the
Missouri river.
lHunters say the increased numbers
are due to the federal law jrohih!ting

UNPREPARED FOR TROUBLE
Dispute Between Capital and

Latin-American Countries Will
Resent Monroe Doctrine.
Chicago, Oct. 20. War with Eu
rope, the east and the 'Latin-American
countries was predicted by Senator J.
Hamilton Lewis at the eighth annual
banquet of the American gas institute
at the Congress hotel.
Not only did Senator Lewis say that
we would probably be called upon to
defend ourselves at the close of the
European conflict, but he said that
we would probably be found unpre
pared because labor and capital had
created class lines which had made it
impossible for the nation to meet on a
common ground to discuss the situa
tion. "You shall not escape conflict," the
speaker declared. "There are some
things which are suppressed now, but
of which you must learn very shortly.
You must address yourself to tomor
row and prepare for what is to fol
low." IKrabt Monroe Doctrine.
The speaker then went on to say
that the i Latin-American countries
were doubtful of our Monroe doctrine
and believe that we ultimately intend
to attempt annexation. After the Eu
ropean war is over he said England
and France would demand that they
be admitted to South America, or at
least maintain that we have no right
to keep them out if the Latins were
willing to let them come in.
Even Germany's interests in Argen
tina, Senator Lewis declared, would
be a matter which would give us great
concern, as she will demand a freer
hand with which to carry on her ope
rations. In Japan and China ixe pictured an
united enemy united on the prin
ciple that they should not be held up
as unfit to mingle with the white race
and demanding a repeal of the ex
clusion .act. Because of Japan's as
sistance to the allies in the European
war. Senator Lewis said he thought
they would call on England, France
and Russia for assistance and get it.

High Food Cost.
Admits Wages Haren't Kept

MINTS BUSY 24 HOURS A DAY
Influx of Gold in Payment for
Heavy Exports.
Foreign Demand Clue for
Scarcity at Home.
Washington, Oct. 20. "America's
great prosperity is in itself responsible
for the high cost of living." Director
Von Engelken of the United States
mint, holds.
With more gold in its vaults, more
money circulated, and the greatest ex
port trade in history, the United
States, he said today, is at once reap
ing a golden harvest, and. to mix the
metaphor paying the piper: the piper
being the high cost of living. His ex
planation was: export trade brings an
unprecedented quantity of gold here.
There is such a vast demand for
goods that prices rise responsively.
More workers than heretofore are em
ployed and they are getting larger
wages than previously. And while
these workers supply the gools, their
wages, drawn from the immense store
of gold, buy more goods than before.
thus helping swell the abnormal de
mand and the consequent price in
crease.
Wages, he admits, have not fully
kept pace with prices as usual but
he hopes for an altered condition in
the future.
High Cost Creature of Own Creation.
"The high cost of living," he said
"is a creature of our own creation.
"The United States is normally a
borrowing nation. Capital utilized for
construction in the past has been re
cruited largely abroad. Our economic
affairs consequently have been adjust
ed to meet the customary outflow of
money required to pay our interest
bills in foreign countries.
"The sudden reversal of this condi
tion, the retention of interest pay
ments at home, coupled with a re
versal of the usual trade conditions,
presents an unusual and extraordinary
economic problem. For the present
we ara reaping a golden harvest and
are spending it In our turn with f
prodigal hand.
"It is to be hoped we will not be
come eo accustomed to. the present
ability to supply our various personal
demands that we will find it difficult
to readjust ourselves to the more nor
mal state of affairs that will confront
us. we hope, in the very near future.
Mints Working 24 Honrs a Day.
Mints are working twentv-four
hours a day trying to keep up with the
demands for coins. In the last two
years $700,000,000 in gold over the
usual importations has poured into the
United States. Figures showing the
following relative demand, for coins
for the periods from January 1 to
October 17 last year and this year
were:
Dimes 1915, $658,000; 1916, $2,-
200.000.
Nickels 1915, $1,100,000; 191S,
$2,950,000.
Pennies 1915, $266,000; 1916, $1,
008.000. "The gold is sent to this country In
t payment for goods purchased.
said
Von Engelken. "It follows that an ex
traordinary market has opened up for
the consumption of our goods to the
extent represented by gold importa
tions. The greater the demand for
goods abroad, the less goods we have
to supply our own demands and as
the price is representative of supply
and demand, an increase in prices
necessarily follows.
Foreign Demand Abnormal.
"The extraordinary demand on this
country has stimulated industry and
in many cases the profits are out of
j the ordinary. As a direct result.
greater number of people are em
ployed at rates of pay above normal,
with the result that our supply of
available goods already heavily drawn
upon by foreign buyers is further
called upon to stand the increasing
purchasing capacity of our own peo
ple, a condition which further contrib
uted to advancing the price of such
things as are demanded by the people
at large."

Roosevelt received a telegraphed codv
of the B.tker speech today and he im

Mexico address Monday. He had pre
viously planned to discuss only th
Mexican situation in both his Phoiuix
and Albuquerque speeches. - -

ing on these two talks and on his ad
dresses at Denver and Chicago, which,
are the next objectives in his cam

plans to discuss social lustice and at
Chicago he will take up in detail the

Tries Out Indian Signs.
It was not until today that it became
known that the colonel had hung tha
Indian sign on Kansas City late yes
terday afternoon. There was the usual
crowd at the station. Altho Roosevelt
had insisted he would make no mora
platform talks he sneaked out to say
howdy and wave his hat. He noticed
a score of Haskell Indians in the
crowd and mysteriously held up two
fingers, the sign of the Pawnee. There
was no response. Next, he drew his
hand across his throat. It was th-
sign of the Sioux. Still no response.
Then he made a sinuous motion with
his forearm across hiB chest and a
shout -went up. There wereComanches
in the crowd and they answered him
with a, walling screech that brought
everyone on the train but the engineer
and fireman to the rear platform.
The colonel, who admittedly was not
optimistic over the middle west sec
tions when he started out today de.
clared he had heard enough from
"What's - the - matter -with - Kansas"
White and I. R. Kirkwood, Kansas
City publisher, to make him predict all
Republican-Progressives who voted
for him four years ago would vote for
Hughes next month.
"Perfectly Satisfied."
"I'm perfectly satisfied," said Roose
velt, "that the party out here has
been thoroly welded together."
Just when the EmDoria author nnrl
editor got time to talk politics with the
colonel no one could fieure out Th.
only topic heard mentioned in the little
ooservation lounge at the end of the
private car was anecdotes of the old
days in the west.

Amsterdam, via London, Oct. 20.
A demand for the stoppage of sub
marine warfare coupled with an ap
peal to the United States to take tha
initiative towards that end is voiced
by the Telcgraaf. The Telcgraaf savs:
"Ten days have elapsed since the
submarine war was carried to the
door of the American republic and
nothing has been done. Are we to
understand that our ships are allowed
to be torpedoed right on the Amer
ican coast? We say in all frankness
to America that submarine war must
be stopped and Germany must be told
that mistakes, which all the world
knows are no mistakes, will no longer
be tolerated. Iet America sneak th.
redeeming word lest she rue deeply
in the future having neglected a task
plainly to be expected foom tha
mightiest neutral."
