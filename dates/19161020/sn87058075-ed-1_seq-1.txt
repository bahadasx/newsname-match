OFFICIAL PAPER OF THE CITY AND COUNTY
LVni,
VOL.
NO. 9
MMOduncacoimn
TICKET.
tJ. T. McWilliams is the Democratic
nomineo for Representative In the Gen
eral Assembly from Howard County
and those farmers and taxpayers who
now realise their mistake in voting for
the present representative, Lee El wood,
have a chance to correct their error
this year by voting for McWlUisms,
the man who should have been elected
in 1914.
llr. McWilliams was born in 1877 on
farm in Clayton County, Iowa, after
wards removing to Allamakee County,
«|Mlin 1901 he came to Chester aud
in the drug business in which
IM is still engaged. He is also inter
ested in the 4^pan Savings Bank, of
Chester, and isSHfegnized by his neigh
tors and townsmen as a careful, con
sorrative and withal successful busi
mss ipan.
3t is almost unnecessary to speak
ahywords of commendation for David
J.' Ferrie, the democratic candidate for
sheriff, lor the faithful and efficient
performance of his official duties,
speaks more emphatically than mere
words. "Dave" has proved to be one
of the very best sheriffs Howard Coun
ties ever had and this with all due
.respect to the long line of good ones
from both political parties. He is
prompt in the discharge of all duties,
tactful awl iBeam mill in his dealings
with those who sometimes are called
before the court in both criminal and
civil procedure and yet firm to obey the
mandstesj^Jaws or courts. Promi
nent attorneys*iar whom he has trans
acted official business unite in pronounc
ing him a most efficient official. There
is no doubt of his re-election solely on
his merits, still it behooves each one of
his friends to see that his vote for
Dave is dspssitsd in the ballot box on
Nov. 7th. Promises and good words
are all right bat they don't count in the
ballot box. If you really want to show
of a faithful public
your vote for him is
counted on election dsy.
George Michel. the democratic nomi-
if ri
&L.
resco
IT
Albion township, being born on the
farm on which he now resides, located
about eight miles north of Cresco. Mr.
Michel has never before been a candi
date for office but in accepting the
nomination for treasurer, acceded to
the wish'es of his many friends who
saw in nim a solid, responsible citizen,
well fitted to take charge of the re
sponsibilities of the office. He is mak
ing an active campaign and asks the
votes of his friends in both parties.
Henry L. Herold, Democratic candi
date for County Recorder, is a son of
Mr. and Mrs. P. M. Herold, old resi
dents of the county, and was born in
New Oregon twp. 28 years ago. He
was educated in the public schools of
the county and gained a business edu
ucation in the Oelwein Business Uni
versity. In addition to this schooling
he has also received a German educa
tion. While Mr. Herold has worked
at farming most of his life, at present
being at that occupation on a farm
northwest of Cresco, he has put his
business training to practical use as .an
employe of the former Woods, Schnei
der & Herold implement firm and also
in office work at St Paul. He is thor
oughly qualified for the position and
can and will give to the office of
Recorder the same capable attention
it has had for the past ten years in the
hands of democratic recorders. Mr.
Herold is making an active campaign
and asks the support of his friends and
acquaintances.
In S. R. Cray, the democrats of the
First Supervisor district, comprising
the townships of Albion, Vernon
Springs and New Oregon, present a
most excellent candidate. Mr. Cray is
eminently qualified for the position.
He comes from one of the oldest fami
lies in the county, most of whom have
been residents and heavy taxpayers in
the county since 1866, a family in which
all are good, prudent business men who
know the value of a dollar and would
see that the expenditure of the
"Ml®
.-r-wyiaaii—
1
pubr
lie money was well safeguarded. Mr.
Craycan be depended upon to look
after the interest* of the district im
partially, and the district owes it to the
fications that he will be a valuable ad
dition to the body of officials who con
trol the expenditures of the county.
John Nath, Sr., nominated for Super
visor in the Third District is ideally lo
cated to give good service to the peo
ple of that district. His home is lo
cated near the west line of Saratoga
twp., one 80 of his farm being in
Jamestown, and west of the Village of
Saratoga, locating him nearly in the
geographical center of the district. Mr.
Nath is a heavy taxpayer, owning a
well stocked farm of 232 acres, and is
thoroughly conversant with public mat
ters coming to the attention of the
Board as for 10 years before coming
to Howard County he was one of the
township trustees in Tama County-, la.
Mr. Nath is making an active canvas
and meets with much encouragement
from voters, irrespective of party, who
believe that competency and centrrf
location will be of great value
majority of the taxpayers of the Dis-
trict.
Dr. C. D. Roome, Cresco's veteran
physician, is tlie democratic nominee
for Coroner, and a long life 'of honor
able public and professional service in
the community is ample assurance of
faithful performance of the duties of
the office in the event of his election.^
Judge Theophilu Struck by an Auto.
Davenport, la. Oct 17.—Judge Wil
liam Theophilus of Davenport, a candi
date for the supreme court- of Iowa
the coming election, was struck by an
automobile here last night and his right
hip aend right leg were broken. James
Von Maur, son of C. J. Von Maur was
daiving the machine.
The foregoing news dispatch was
especially shocking to his many friends
in Howard County, for the Judge spent
from Saturday till Monday in Cresco
and Lime Springs, and had just re
turned home|when the accident occurred.
