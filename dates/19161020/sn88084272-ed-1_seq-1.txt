Milwaukee. "Wis.. Oct 20,-j-Measles

'Some phvsicians have advocated in
sulating everv healthy baby under
f.e months old with the contagious
nasal secretions of a child sick with the
measles," he said "They would do
this, on the assumption that in children
of less than 6 months the disease is
practically harmless and that they
would thus be freed from the danger
of contracting it at a later and more
d , ngerous ape. Experience with mea
sles among the children at the immi-
. i.int hospital at Kills Island shows
hat the foregoing assumption is with
' c ut adequate foundation,

Worse Than Infantile Paraiysl".
Dr. Borden S. Veeder. of St. Locis.
fiirMt attention to the fact that al
though measles and whooping cough J
are sucn every-aay events mai me
are regarded of little importance, be
tween 9.0M and 19.006 children die an
nually in the United States from each
or these diseases.
"Thus." he said, "each of these dis
eases causes more deaths than scarlet
fever, and a gre?t many more than
1 infantile paralysis. 0er half of the
deaths from wnoopmg cougn are in
infante under one year of age and
9 percent in children under 1.
Measles likewise ha its highest mor
tality among infants. The widespread
idea that it is a good thing for a child
to have these diseases early and "get
them over with." is erroneous. The
younger the child the higher the fa
tality rate. In infancy some ten out
of every hundred cases die. while the
mortality rate In children over five
years is about one in two hundred
cases. In both diseases by far the
larger number of deaths are due to
pneumonia and other complications of
the respiratory tract."
