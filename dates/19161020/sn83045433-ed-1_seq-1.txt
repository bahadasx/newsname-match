French Bayonets Subdue Sul

Paris. Oct 19.-The allied program with
regard to Greece is now nearing the stage
of completion.
While sullen crowds still fill the streets
of Athens. the initial excitement follow
ing the landing of foreign marines has
now died down. The personal plea of
King Constantine to a number of the
most prominent royalists that the pop
ular manifestations be restrained has had
a good effect.
The gleaming bayonets of the Freneh
marinee. who display no hesitancy in
using them, also has had a quieting ef
fect on the rioters, as has the dissipa
tion of the rumor that a fleet of United
States battleships is on the way to pro
tect Greece from further neutrality vio
lations.
Meanwhile In the allies' chancellories.
under the main leadership of Premier
Briand, (f France, the allies are prepar
ing for final action in Greece. This ac
tion will not abuse the constitutional lib
erty of the Greek nation, but is designed
to guard the safety of the expeditionary
force now on Greek soil.
The recent anti-entente demonstrations
are declared to be reason enough why
no stone should be left unturned to pro
tect the French, British, Russian. and
Serbian eoldiers now fighting In Mace

The Fren-,h marines are now In com

Paris, Oct. 19.-Closing in on Peronne
from the south, the troops of Gen. Foch
have maintained for twenty-four hours a
series of attacks. all of which have re
suited in steady progress. The main
blows are being delivered on the
Biauches-La Masonnette front, a sector
of about a mile and a half. So far more
than 360 prisoners ha'e been taken.
Meanwhile they have firmly consolj
dated themselves in the ruined village of
Sailly-Saillesel, astride the Peronne-Ba
paume road, north of the river, while the
British, despite stormy weather, have
pressed forward some distance in the re
glon of Butte de Warlencourt, a domi
nating height southwest of Bapaume, the
second objective of the allied drive.
The Germans have attempted several
severe counter-attacks against Saily
Saillese . all of which were repulsed.
German counter-attacks against the new
liritsh positions in the Butte de Warin
court region also were repulsed.
The new allied advances mark a fur

and a direct frontal movement against

claring that they were not commensurate
to the losses suffered. The German war
