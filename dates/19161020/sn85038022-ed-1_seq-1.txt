Klsewhere In this Isaue will be
f mid (lie advertisement of the snle of
The Maysvllle Machine and Iron
Works, an instjtution which bears a
vital relationship to this community
l goes without saying that It would be
a great misfortune to dismantle this
plant and disperse the up-to-date stock
and equipment at a time when the
need for such a convenience is more
than ever.
Aside from a long history of suc
cessful operation, nearly half a cen
tury, this shop by reason of Its loca
tion. Its present volume of buslnesr
nnd good will, and the further fact
that a limited capital can purchase
and continue it, should make It a very
attractive proposition for local capi
tal. MM siliri'Kli
The body of Albert Starke, who was
killed at South Hipley last week by
Pete Faulkner, was shipped to rela
tives in Wilmington, Ohio, yesterday
by Coughlin & Co. The reason of th.'
body being held so long was on ac
count of the fact that his relatives
could not be placed at first.

K. HiiKhpR reiterating that
he meant what he Raid in Ixiiilavlllc
the other night, about the course he
would have followed with referene
to the I.ueitania. tonight replied to I
recent utterance of Secretary McAdoo,
with th.' declaration that apparently it
m fined InipoHHihle to the admlnlatra

said.
"Now rises the Secretary of the
Treasury to complain that thia whr
not a statement of what I would have
done had the sinking occurred," Mr
Hughes said, after reiterating that he
would have stated IiIr position "un
equlvocably" in advance of the sink
Ing.
"I was under the impresaion that
when I said what I would have stated
In advance as to what I would do,
every one would know thut I state.;
what in fHCt I would have done in tin
subsequent event. The Secretary's re
marks show In an illuminating way
his administration's conception of the
value of words.
"It apparently seeniB impossible to
this administration that one can mean
what he says. That is its difficulty
With It, a threat of action does not
seem to mean anything hut words. Mj
position is somewhat different.
"I mean what I gay and because this
would have been well known and we
should already have had a reputation
for firm and correct policies, I repast
that the Lusitanla would not have
been sunk."
Mr. Hughes spoke before an audi
ence in a theater here. He also re
plied to a statement attributed to Sec
retary of War Baker, in n recen.
speech in which Washington soldiers
in the march to Valley Forge in the
days of the American revolution were
said to be just as hud characters as
the Mexicans.
"I never supposed the day would
come." Mr. Hughes said, "when the
i'" p resen tat ive of an American admin
istration would say that of those who
.nave us our liberties."
After -quoting the statement at
tributed to Secretary Baker, Mr.
1 1 utiles read from Secretary Lansing's
description in June last of the atro
cities in Mexico, contained in a note
to the de facto government In Mexi
co. Mr. Ianslug's recital of the civil
strife in Mexico, wilh its attendan.
loss of American life and destruction
of American property and that portion
of the note relating to the Santa
Vsabel massacre were read by Mr.
Hughes verbatim.
Mr. Hughes' speech here tonight
was the last of his third Presidential
campaign trip. He left here at 11
o'clock tonight for New York. where
he is due tomorrow afternoon. The dav
was spent traveling with three short
addresses at Bay City, Saginaw and
Flint, Mich. It was raining and the
damp weather affected the nominee's
voice.
