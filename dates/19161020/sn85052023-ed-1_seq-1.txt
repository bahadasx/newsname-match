JAMES N. SAUNDERS
IS CHOSEN NEW GRAND MAS
TER OF KENTUCKY MASONS
Supreme Office In Great Order Con-
frered Upon Stanford Man by
Grand Lodge This Week.
James N. Saunders, a member of
Lincoln lodge No. 60, Free and Ac
cepted Masons, of Stanford, was at
Louisville this week, elevated to the
eminent position of Grand Master of
Kentucky Masons, the supreme hon
or in the great and noble fraternity
of Masonary that can be conferred
upon a member of the order. That he
will in every way measure up to the
loftiest traditions of the rank, and
the highest standard ever set by any
officer of this ancient and honorable
order, his brothers of Lincoln lodge,
and the people among whom he lives
and moves daily, know to be well as
sured and without shadow of a doubt.
Lincoln lodge, Stanford and Lincoln
county feel it an honor to them as
well as to their brother and fellow
citizen that the Masons of Kentucky
should have selected this man, out of
the thousands of members of this or
der, to sit in the most exalted chair
in the Grand Lodge. The honor is
well and worthy bestowed, and gavel
of the Grand Master will be faithful
ly and fair and impartially wield
ed in the hands of this man at all
times and upon all conditions.
The election of Mr. Saunders came
in the usual rotation of officials of
the Grand Lodge, he having served
as Deputy Grand Master during the
past year. As many as possible of
Vip Incnl Masons who could go, at
tended the Grand Lodge this year for
they felt a personal interest in the
elevation of their brother member
to the high post he now fills. All
testify to the beauty and solemnity
of the occasion. Those who heard the
speech of acceptance of the new
Grand Master, say that he fairly out
did himself in eloquence and fervor.
It is customary upon such a momen
tous occasion for the home lodge of
the newly elected Grand Master to
be first to present him with a floral
tribute upon his ascension to the
order's highest chair. This was done
on behalf of the Lincoln lodge No.
GO by Joseph Hopper, of this city,
now attending the Presbyterian The
ological Seminary at Louisville.
Young Hopper's address to the
Grand Lodge and i the new Grand
Master in making his presentation,
is said to have been a gem in every
vay, and to have held the breathless
attention of the entire membership
of the Grand Lodge". Then iollowed
Grand Master Saunders's short
speech in response, which is said to
have been equally as beautiful in
tenor and language. And so impress
ed was the membership of the Grand
Lodge by these three speeches, that
it was moved and carried, though al
most unprecedented in the history of
the Grand Lodge, that these three
speeches be written out and incorpo
rated in the official proceedings of
the Grand Lodge sessions of 191G.
Other Masons of Lincoln county

Biography of Grand Master Jas.
. E. Wilhelm, Paducah.
A great many warm friends in this
section were gratified by the elec
tion of Hon. Henry S. McElroy, of
Lebanon, as Grand Junior Warden,
which puts him in line for Grand Mas
ter in a few years. Other officers of
' the Grand Lodge were advanced in
office by progression, save that Grand
Secretary Dave Jackson and Grand
Treasurer John H. Leathers were
re-elected.
Retiring Grand Master T. J. Ad
ams reported that there now are in
the Masonic Widows and Orphans'
Home in Louisville 26 widows, 132
girls and 184 boys. An increase of
the assessment on each Mason for the
home from 75 cents to $1 was rec
ommended. The report of Grand
Secretary Jackson showed a total of
592 Masonic lodges now exist in Ken
tucky with a total membership of
43,387, an increase during the year
of 993. James Garnett, chairman of
the educational trustees of the Grand
Lodge, reported that 16 children
above the age of 16 years, the age
limit fixed for wards of the Home,
had been placed in various schools
of the state for higher vocational
eduaction. There will be about the
same number to be cared for next
June, he announced.
Teddy Couldn't Stop
Special Very Late So No Stop Was
Made for Speech Here.
Col. Theodore Roosevelt, ex-president
of the United States, and tour
ing the country on behalf of Hughes
the republican candidate for presi
dent, disappointed some 1,200 or
1,500 people here Wednesday night,
when his special train "highballed"
on through Stanford, and did not
stop for Teddy to make a speech as
he had been advertised to do. The
special was running very late, how
ever, due to the fact that Roose
velts' speeches consumed more time
than had been anticipated. The
train did not pass through Stanford
until about 6:15 when it was sched
uled here for 4:33. It was necessary
that no stops be made at small towns
in order for Roosevelt to get to
Louisville in time for his night
speech there.
Republicans, Democrats, Bull
Moose and every other sort of voter
gathered here by hundreds from this
and surrounding counties to see the
Terrible Teddy, and hear what he
had to say. King Swope, of Dan
ville, and other local speakers en
tertained the crowd during its long
wait. Roosevelt was heard by a tre
mendous crowd at Louisville, where
he bitterly attacked President Wil
son and his peaceful policies.. His
speech was almost entirely a person
al attack upon President Wilson. By
ridicule and abuse of the foreign
policy of Mr. Wilson, he sought to
show why the Republican party
should be restored to power. He said
the President had been guilty of the
following:
"Yielding to force in the enact
ment of the Adamson eight-hour law
for railroad men;
Failing io hold Germany to strict
accountability for the invasion of
Belgium;
"Saying he was 'too proud to fight'
over the murder of 1,394 men, wo
men and children on the Lusitania;
"Failing to protect property rights
of American citizens against Great
Britain's blockade;
"Prostituting America's National
honor to Mexican bandits, in return
for which he has won only a venom
ous and treacherous hostility to the
United States;
"Instead of speaking softly and
carrying a 'big stick' President Wil
son spoke bombastically and carried
a dishrag," said Colonel Roosevelt.
Burglar Pleads Guilty
Maywood Marauder is Held to Grand
Jury Under $300 Bond
Wm. Cunningham, the young bm
glar who created something of a sen
sation around Maywood and vicinity
by robbing the home of Theo Noland
and the store of W. P. Stephenson
early last week, was held to await
the action of the grand jury by
County Judge Bailey at his examin
ing trial Tuesday. Cunningham pled
guilty and was sent to jail as he
could not give the $300 bond re
quired. E. V. Sizemore, of the South Fork
section, who is charged with having
struck Daniel Owens with a corn
knife, was held to the grand jury
under $150 bond in county court
this week, and was also put under
a peace bond of .$250 both of which
he furnished and was released.
Joseph Randolph Huston, a young
negro, charged with breach of the
peace, in that he fired a rifle at an
other boy, was fined $5 and costs
which he paid into court. The pick
anniny who is only 11 years of age
claimed that he was running when
he fell and the riflle was accidentally
discharged.
Eai'l Carson, colored, who was
charged with attacking Fred Nikula,
a well known resident of the Otten
heim section, was acquitted at his
trial in county court.
COL. FARRIS LANDS AGAIN
Colonel George T. Farris, of Lan
caster, was appointed executive mar
shal in Governor Stanley's office to
succeed B. F. Williams, who becomes
stewart of the Feeble-minded Insti
tute. Colonel Farris, who is helping
at the Democratic state headquarters
will not go to Frankfort until after
the election.

Bull Moose For Wilson
Covington Progressive To Speak Iij
Lincoln Other Speaking Dates
No stone is being left unturned
by the democrats to acquaint the
voters of Lincoln county with the is
sues involved in the present cam-,
paign. Speakers are billed for almost1!
every night from now to election day
and the importance of every citizen
who loves his home and his country
going to the polls and voting for
Woodrow Wilson and the entire dem
ocratic ticket, is being impressed up
on all.
Announcement was made this week
by County Attorney W. S. Burch,
who is making the speaking appoint
ments over the county, that Hon. An
drey F. Adkins, a former Progressive,
of Covington, and said to be a splen
did speaker, has been secured for an
address in Lincoln. Mr. Adkins has
been billed to speak at King's Mount
ain, on Thursday evening, October
26th at 7 o'clock. The Woodrow
Wilson Club, of King's Mountain will
meet at that hour and Mr. Adkins'
will speak to the club members arid'
all other citizens are invited to hear'
him. Mr. Adkins is one of the Pro-,
gressives who did not follow Roose
velt in his betrayal of that party to
the Republican Old Guard, but reay
lizes that Woodrow Wilson has done
more to carry out progressive prin'
ciples during his one term than all
the republican presidents the coun
try has had since Lincoln. Mr. Ad
kins, as a progressive, is urging mem
bers of his party to vote for Wilson
this year as offering the only real
hope for continuance of progressive'
legislation.
Hon. Orie S. Ware, who is already
well known in this county both by
reason of having married Miss Louise
Culbertson, related to many Lincoln
families, and thru the fact that he is
a Past Grand Master of the Masonic
order, is billed for two speeches in
Lincoln next week at Waynesburg,
on Wednesday evening, Oct. 25th and
at Hustonville, on Thursday evening,
Oct. 26th, both speakings beginning
at 7 o'clock. Mr. Ware is a splen
did speaker and a charming gentle
man in every way and large crowds
will undoubtedly be present on both
occasions to hear him.
A speaking date has been made
for J. S. Owsley and W. H. Shanks
of this city at Rowland on Saturday
night, October 28th at 7 o.clock.
Splendid crowds are turning out at
all of the Democratic speaking ap
pointments in the county and an un
usual amount of interest seems to
be manifested in the present cam
paign. Workers who have gone over
the county say that they never before
in a campaign have they .seen so
many men who ordinarily vote the
republican ticket in an election.bold
ly come out and say they intend to
vote for Wilson this time. They say
that they do not want to take a
chance on this nation being plunged
into the horrors of war; that Wil
son has kept it at peace so far and
there's no use in taking such a dan
gerous chance at such a critical per
iod in the country's history. Other
speaking engagements for the coun
ty so far announced are as follows:
Ellison's, School House Saturdav,

PUT A HOT ONE TO TEDDY.
When Roosevelt arrived in Cincin
nati Wednesday morning, a "night
lettei" was delivered to him from
former Vice Mayor Frank L. Pfaff,
of Cincinnati, asking the Colonel to
answer certain questions relative to
the German-American vote. Mr.
Pfaff is Secretary-Treasurer of the
Cincinnati Wilson Business Men's
League. The Colonel was asked to
say if he has assurances from Mr.
Hughes that if the latter is elected
he will carry out the warlike policies
which the Colonel advocates, and
whether or not Mr. Hughes indorses
the insults heaped upon German
American citizens by Mr. Roosevelt.
So far as reported to the newspapers,
Mr. Roosevelt ignored the questions
asked him by Mr. Pfaff.

Some Pig Tale, This
Fat Hog Falls Thro' Culvert,
Found Alive Six Weeks Later
h
Preachersville, Ky., Oct. 20.
About six weeks ago Tom Gill
drove a bunch of hogs, about 60 in
number to Rowland for J. M. Cress.
When arriving at the stock yards
where the bunch was counted, it
was found that one of the porkers
was missing. Mr. Gill thought it had
crept through some opening in the
roadside fences, but a general search
and much subsequent inquiry is failed
to locate the missing hog. As the hog
weighed about 275 pounds and hogs
were then selling at nine cents, here
was a dead loss of almost $25. Last
Thursday the head stock driver, W.
T. Blankenship, when on the road
wjtha bunch of sheep and cattle be
lo'ing to Mr. Cress, was keen-eyed
enough to find the missing swine
where it had been all the time, in
plain sight of all who passed the road
during the time the hog was gone.
Near the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
M. F. Lawrence their spring branch
leaves their premises and runs under
the pike, and into the field below. At
the end of the culvert the water had
washed out quite a sink hole about
three feet wide and three feet deep,
and drift and mud had filled the cul
vert and it was thereby put out of
commission. Here in this narrow pris
on the hog had fallen while being
crowded along by the rest of the
drove. As the man in ehai'ge did not
see it fall in, it was "out of sight,
out of mind." Here for six weeks it
had subsided on the bark of the syc
amore roots ayd the least possible
amount of water during the continu
ed drouth. When first lost it was fat
enough to butcher; when found it
was a shadow, lean, lank and posi
tively disgusting in appearance. Af
ter a few days careful nursing and
dieting the hollow-sided spectre is
feeling like a new hog. About five
days before, young Blankenship,
while with a drove of cattle, saw the
hog in this sink hole, but failed to ;
connect it with the missing one,
which by this time had about been
given up for good. He thought it was
only a rambling roadside hog and
could walk back through the culvert
to where it could regain the highway.
Thinking no more about it at the
time he was much surrised to see the
same hog in the same place on the
morning of the discovery and curios
ity prompted him to investigate which
resulted in piggy being restored to
his owner. Moral: Our county offi
cials while out inspecting Dixie
Highways in their "autobiles" would
do well to hook up old Dobbin and
inspect some of our East End roads
which need something and need it
badly. The above mentioned culvert
is not the only one which is "blind",
several can be found, and some cul
verts are now positively dangerous.

Historic House Burns
Mr.
and Mrs. Fisher Herring Lose
Dwelling and All Contents.
Preachersville, Ky., Oct. 20.
The stone residence of Mr. and
Mrs. Fisher Herring near here, just
over the line in Garrard on Drake's
creek, burned down about eight o'
clock Saturday night. Very little of
the household furniture was saved,
the fire having gained such headway
before neighbors arrived on the
scene. Mrs. Herring had probably the
largest and costiest collection of an
tique furniture in Central Kentucky
all of which was a total loss. Very
little of their library was saved and
a lot of jewelry and manuscripts
were consumed. No insurance. Mrs.
Herring was visiting in Lancaster at
the time, while Mr. Herring was at
Preachersville. Some of the neighbors
made heroic efforts to enter the
building but were repulsed by the
flames which came as if from a roar
ing furnace. The structure was a
large two-story stone building and
the interior wood work was all cut
out by a whip saw and put together
by hand forged nails. It was built
prior to 1794 by Rev. Thomas Wil
liams, an early Baptist preacher, who
was one of the thirteen original
members who organized Drake's
Creek church in 1801. The house was
built with high, narrow windows and
heavy oaken doors, with sevcrajl port
holes commanding each side from
whence the rifle men might repel the
Indians. This house was one of the
four original "Stone Forts" built at
that remote period in Drake's creek
valley. Three of the number burned,
two of which were rebuilt, one again
burning a few years afterward.
Miss Dolly Ballard, the 14-year-old
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. W. F. Bal
lard, is critically ill of typhoid fever.
The protracted meeting at the Bap
tist church conducted by Rev. J. W.
Beagle, the pastor, closed last week
with 14 additions.
Coal Going Up
Can't Get Cars To Ship
Railroads Are So Busy.
Mine
As
Local coal dealers are warning
their patrons of the rapid increase in
price of coal and urging them to lay
in their winter supply early. J. H.
Baughman & Company say that coal
which they formerly bought at $1.75
a ton is now costing them $3 and
there's no telling where it will stop.
The increase in price is said to be
due largely to the shortage of cars
in which to ship out black diamonds
from the mines in eastern Kentucky.
The railroads are congested every
where with freight business. Tjmes
were never so prosperous with them,
and it has proven an impossibility
to obtain cars to meet the demand.
It is said that the great demand for
coal for steam purposes has put the
price of nut and slack coal out of
sight, and the mines have contracts
which will take their full normal
winter's production. If the car short
age .continues, however, it can only
mean that the mines will deliver on
ly a proportion of their contract out
put which means inevitable commer
cial distress and possible suffering in
the cold weather. The situation has
improved little if any in the last few
weeks.
WILSON AT CHICAGO.
In three speeches in Chicago
Thursday, where he was welcomed
by great cheering crowds in the
streets, and at meetings, President
Wilson declared the ho.ur had come
for rallying the forces of society un
der a common banner, a sort of "re
naissance of patriotic responsibility"
and that women would display a dis
tinguished part in the new order,
while the employer who would not
voluntarily consider the employes'
conditions would be made by law to
do so. A delegation of the National
Women's party attempted an anti
Wilson demonstration and were
roughly handled in a near-riot, their
banners being taken from them and
trampled.
COULDN'T SIDESTEP LAW.
The proprietor of another State
line liquor emporium, this one in
Whitley county, must go to jail thru
failure of his efforts to circumvent
the local option laws of Kentucky by
negotiating various steps of the tran
saction across the State line. Wil
liam Logan is the defendant and a
fine of $100 and a jail sentence of
forty days were affirmed by the
Court of Appeals this week.
WILSON A WINNER
ACCORDING TO "STRAW VOTE"
ALL OVER THE NATION
Two Big Dailies Practically Concede
Big Democratic Victory Result
of "Straw Vote" Here
The Cincinnati Enquirer Sunday
published the result of the "straw
vote" which its correspondent took
in Stanford on Court Day, the 9th,
on Main street among farmers and
stockmen in town that day and in the
business houses. The result was 209
for Wilson; 49 for Hughes. The
changes in vote were 1 Democrat to
Republican, 2 Republican to Demo
crat, 5 Progressives to Republican
and 4 Progressives to Democrat.
There were 3 votes for Prohibition
and two switched from Progressive
to Prohibtion.
This "straw vote" was taken ab
solutely fairly and impartially, and is
in line with the results which are ap
pearing in the straw vote which the
Enquirer is taking in other parts of
Kentucky and which show that with
out doubt this state will roll up an
old time majority for Woodrow Wil
son on November 7th.
The straw vote which the Enquirer
is taking all over the country in con
nection with the New York Herald
seems to indicate the election of Wil
son without a shadow of a doubt. No
poll is being taken in the southern
states which are always reliably dem
ocratic, but the vote in the central,
western, northern and eastern states,
shows that Wilson will carry a suf
ficient number of them to insure his
election.
One of the surprises of the straw
voting has been the runaway race
that Wilson is making in Ohio, upon
which the republicans had counted
upon carrying for a certainty. Many
are inclined to view these "straw
votes" as of no consequence or as
not indicating how the election will
go. However, it only need be said
that these two great daily papers
have been taking this straw vote be
fore each presidential election for
the past 15 or 20 years and they
have always forecasted the result of
the following election. Not a single
time, has the general result ever
been different from what their straw
vote taken beforehand, indicated.
For this reason when such states
as New York, West Virginia, Con
necticut, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Rhode Island, Wisconsin, Missouri,
Oklahoma, Minnesota, South Dakota,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Colo
rado, Arizona, Ohio and Tennessee
are showing up with good majorites
for Wilson in the straw vote. Demo
crats and many others believe that
all doubt as to the result on Nov.
7th has been removed. The states
which are showing for Hughes in the
straw votes are: New Jersey, Dela
ware, Maine, New Hampshire, Ver
mont, California, Indiana, Illinois,
Iowa, Michigan, Nebraska, Kansas,
North Dakota, Oregon, Wyoming,
Nevada and New Mexico.
Of course, there will be changes
in a number of the states shown to
be favorable to oil'? side or the oth
er, but the general result seems to
indicate that Wilson is a sure win
ner. The great masses of the labor
ing people, and the workingmen all
over the country are for him. A sur
prise has been thrown into republi
can ranks everywhere also by the
practically solid support which Wil
son is receiving in states where wo
men have the right to vote. This is
believed. to be the result of Wilson's
continued policy toward keeping the
United States out of war. The wo
men do not want their husbands and
sons sacrificed, and their homes des
olated. They know that Wilson
stands for peace, and do not know
what might happen should Hughes
win, so seemingly are not anxious to
make a change, but want to let well
enough alone.
An indication of how things look
in Ohio, which now seems certain to
o for Wilson, was contained in a
news story in the Cincinnati Enqui
rer Wednesday which said that the
Republican leaders of that state had
secretly passed out the word to their
workers over the state to "let Hughes
slide" and to devote their efforts to
saving their candidates for governor
and United States senator. Accord
ing to the Enquirer, the republican
leaders see that Wilson-is certain to
carry Ohio but think by letting the
national campaign alone, and letting
Wilson have things his own way,
they may yet be able to elect their
candidates for the two state offices.
The New York Herald, which is
bitterly fighting Wilson, says that the
states which are in the Wilson col
umn have 312 electoral votes, of
which 266 will elect. The Herald
says that the republicans seem to be
at a standstill, while the democrats
are forging ahead. The Herald de
clares that New York, Illinois, Ohio
and Indiana will decide the election.
A special dispatch from Boston in
the Herald says: "Wilson sentiment
is growing alarmingly. The Tele
gram, evening edition of the Herald,
probably the most vehement anti
Wilson organ in New York, says un
der the heading, "Campaign Slump
Worries Leaders of Republicans,"
that fear of the loss of the labor
vote has added to other causes of
apprehension among the Republicans
and that with the presidential elec
tion less than four weeks off, repub
lican managers admit that the cam
paign, so far as the Republican party
is concerned, VhaS struck a slump."
