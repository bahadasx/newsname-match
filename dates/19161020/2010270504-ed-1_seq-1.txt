Here's the coat that has all the "satisfao
tiorvgiving" qualities of the ordinary over-
coat easy, roomy arid comfortable. The
linings are left out. reducing the cost to
within the reach of men who want a
well-made, stylish garment at much less
cost than they would have to bay for. a
lined coat of inferior make and fabric.
-
It has the swagger style, theindividual
character and personal expression that one
expects in a much higher priced coat.
It is the correct coat to wear for all occa
sions and in all weather a utility coat for
any purpose and for any time.
Nocfcabotif quality in the lowest or highest priced
models, is reliable and dependable. It offers more in
the way of style, service, comfort and convenience
than any other garment selling at the same price.

Coal Advances In Price.
Local coal dealers wero notified
yesterday of a, fifty coht advanco In
tho prlco of Rock Springs and Colo
rado coal. This will probably ehodt
Rock Springs up td $8.00 a ton; Tho
mine companies claim that this ad
vanco has boon made necessary by the
shortage of cars, tho inability to ship
tho coal as fast as mined resulting in
an additional cxpeiibO to tho compan
ies. It Is a good guess that .tho real
causo of tho raiso is that tho coal op
orators of Wyoming and Colorado havo
"got together' at last, after attenpt
lng .to do so for several years.
