NUMBER 16
Be a Regular Man
There are many men in this
county who have not paid their
poll taxes. They are good men,
but careless. This condition
should not exist. It makes no
matter whether you are a Repub
lican, Democrat, Progressive, or
what not, if you would maintain
your self respect as a part and
parcel of the government of this
state, you should exercise that
sovereign right granted you by
your state, and put yourself in
shape to vote on November 7th,
when not only state officers are
to be elected, but a President and
Vice-President of the United
States.
Be a regular man and get your
poll tax straight. It is worth
the price to feel like a man. and
no male twenty-one years old is a
man who cannot take his stand
by his fellow man and vote his
convictions in a free and untram
eled country.
Get right NOW.
Pay your Poll Tax TODAY.
The County Fair
The eighth annual fair of the Mc
Nairy County Fair Association was
held here last week, and it is gener
ally conceded that it is the best one
yet held. The attendance was great
er than was expected, the weather
was good, and the big crowds seemed
to enjoy the entire 4 days of the
Fair. Whila some of the departments
possibly did not contain as numerous
exhibits as could be found at other
fairs, the exhibits last week were of
excellent quality. ' The entries in the
Lire Stock Department and in the
Agricultural Department represented
the best that the county has, snd the
Floral Hall contained the prettiest ex
hibits that hare been seen in that de
partment. Exhibitors were from the
town, the county, different parts of
state and from other states. The ar
rangement of the various exhibits
was a splendid one, and the building
was crowded during the whole of the.
Fair. ' , ?, ;. v -:.
i The Association furnished excellent
daily programs, and the (5eople seemed
to enjoy them. Better racing could
not be seen, as 'some of the fastest
horses were to be seen. The interest
that the local contests aroused con
tributed to the success of this part of
the program. V
There were many . high-class, clean
attractions on the ground, and the
excellent music was furnished by the
Leggette & Brown - Show's Band.
These show people, Leggette & Brown,
are Tennesseans, the former living at
Humboldt; and the latter at McMinn
ville, and they do all. in their power
to help in the entertainment, and to
assist the Fair in every way possible.
The people connected with them ap
pear to be high-class, and their per
formances are high-class. The pat
ronage they received was liberal, and
the people were pleased .with the
treatment received. .
It was a great fair, and the people
of the county gave it liberal patron
age.': Interest in the fair should net
be permitted to die out. Right now
" is the time to begin making prepara
tions for the 1917 Fair.
.The receipts of the fair put the
fair out of debt and with enough left
to declare a substantial dividend to
the stockholders.
Louisville Letter
v : Louisville, Ky.. Oct. 15.
Having been sent to this fine
Southern town by the Government on
some special business, I thought your
readers might like to have a little
sk etch of the trip and the place.
The rush and the roar of business
and the hurrying multitudes in the
great cities remind one of mighty
rivers, but in Washington it is like a
quiet lake, where the ripple is ever
present, but Beldom turbulence or
noise. The rows of modest dwellings,
and even the granite and marble pal
aces of Uncle Sam, look puny beside
the giant structures of New York,
for that city is now twenty times the
size of the capital of our nation.
Down through Baltimore, Harris
burg, Johnstown, and onward to the
southwest, glide the Pennsylvania
trains; the capital of Pensylvania
nestled od the Susquehanna with its
Preparedness !
Are you ready for Winter? Ia your system clear of
catarrh? Have Summer colds left you entirely? Have you
overcome all effects of Summet foods?
If you haven't, restore your body to full vigor with the
old standby
PERUNA
If a the tonic that clears away the congestion, purifies the
network of long bridges looks pretty,
but we are there only a few minutes;
as dusk comes on we come through
Johnstown, and some one points out
the valley through which on that
fatal day some twenty-eight years
ago, a flood came, down .from the
mountain reservoir which washed
thousands of human lives into eterni
ty; everything nicely built up again
and not a sign left of the disaster.
In smoky Pittsburg, in which we stop
for a few minutes, the night is light
ed with a thousand furnaces, and I
can see the lurid flames rolling up
from the Bessemer steel works, and
hear the muffled roar of the mills
where- puny man is working with
Jovian thunderbolts to subdue and
fashion the refractory elements for
his use. At early morning we roll
into Cincinnati and get a fairly good
breakfast for seventy cents, and the
grinning darky hovers around till you
have to give him a tip to get rid of
him. Noon finds us in Louisville; we
mount a trolley car and offer a dime;
the conductor hands us a little en
velope with two nickels; we break it
open, deposit a nickel, and are soon
at a hotel which would be a credit
even to New York City; an elegant
structure of nearly 500 rooms, and
every necessary adjunct to modern
luxurious living. I do not mention
its name, for some one might think
this was a puff for it.
. Under my window on tho sixth floor,
run the cars and walk the crowds of a
real city; the brilliant streets at night
are good to look at; the theaters are
big and good enough for any north
ern city. Fourth street, Louisville,
has its sky-scrapers and its fine
stores, and it certainly is a fine old
town. It is on the line between the
North and South, and partakes of
both sides in manners and appearanc
es; the fine old Southern courtesy
which prompts a man to take' off his
hat when ladies are in the elevator, is
here in full force, and the darkey
everywhere (but always in his place,
and quite respectful, too) shows that
we are in Dixie.
A poor old blind fiddler scrapes his
tired instrument on Fourth ' street
from morning till night; they say he
holds the long-distance record for
continuous playing, but he tells me
eleven hours is as long as he has
ever played. He says he Js from
Columbia, Tenn., "God's country,"
and intends to get back there Boon.
It is time that he, his fiddle (and his
hearers) were getting a rest.
- Louisville has about a quarter of a
million people, and seems to be' solid
ly prosperous. Last night I met a
man from Nashville, who said he had
just been in Memphis, and that town
was in fine financial shape. "In
fact," he said, "West Tennessee is in
better shape than it has been for a
long time. Cotton has helped many
there, having gone to sixteen cents
and better, a pound. I saw an old
darkey go into a store there, and or
der nearly $100 worth of furniture;
he dug down into his pocket and
brought up a handful of twenty-dollar
gold pieces and said with importance:
'I wants de best stuff you've got in
de stoT The darkey said he had
paid out of debt on his cotton, and
that there were lots of others like
him." Cotton has for once vindicated
itself but the trouble is that many
will go into it heavily to the neglect
of more salable things, like pork or
grain, and then be at the mercy of
the same Old low market. But if tbe
people are wise they will save some
of their cotton money . this time and
not put it into the same old crop
again, but spread out on corn and
hogs, which always command a mar
ket.
There ia a big hog market here,
and aa soon as I can, I will write

IF ELECTION WERE OVER?
While Democrat. Are Admittedly the
Champion Question Fisnds, It It
Believed Thla Quia I. a tin
answerable as Their Moat
Childlike Effort .
If election day were past would
President Wilson make so little of the
principle of arbitration in industrial
disputes? Would he be so sure that
It Is more Important to preserve peace,
when a great strike la threatened, than
it is to"make Judicial methods rather
than force the means of settling dif
ferences between capital and labor?
If election day had come and gone
would Mr. Wilson keep tho iatlonal
piiardsinon of the country In camp on
the ground that they may be needed
to protect the United States against
Mexico? Would there be months of
Inaction and Indecision In which no
use Is made of a large body of citizen
soldiers? Would they not be allowed
to go home or else be set In motion to
make Mexico as safe a neighbor as the
Administration seems to think that It
Is already?
If election day were past would the
President drive through Congress - a
bill like the shipping bill which Is In
tended to embark the federal govern
ment upon a new venture In a hazard
ous field and use 5.10,000,000 of the
people's money to buy .tonnage held
above Its' normal value or else so
owned that It cannot be used without
peril of international complications?
Ia sound public policy behind such
a measure or only campaign politics?
If election day were not to be con
sidered would Woodrow Wilson use so
many high and mighty words In Inter
national notes and do so little to make
them mean anything practical? Would
his deeds lag so far behind bis
phrases? Cleveland Leader.

A man In Washington has made a
bust of the President, thus anticipat
ing Mr. Hughes by several weeks.
Discussing the indorsement by the
Democratic convention of Texits of
Mr. . Wilson's Mexican policy," the
Houston Post (Dem.) flatly declares:
"It Is not believed anything like a
majorlty jof the people of Texas in
dorse our Mexican policy, and those in
a position to know seriously doubt
that the platform adopted expressed
the real sentiments of the convention
Itself."
The Omaha Bee couples woeful
waste with watchful waiting as a
Democratic falling. , .
Boiled down, the best that has bean
said of President Wilson's Mexiean
policy was that he had good inten
tions. We've often heard of a road
paved with' this kind of material. .
The PrcdUcot Is deceived if he be
lieves that the history he has written
is not more praiseworthy 'than that
which he lias mnde.
The Soldier Vote.
A significant feature following tbe

It is reported that one Maine bat
