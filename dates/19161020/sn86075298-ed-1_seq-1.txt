CARRYING CAPACITY
IRRIGATED PASTURE
The following report of a test of
the carrying capacity of irrigated
pastures on the Huntley (Montana
Farms taken from the farm superin
tendent's report of work for 1915, re
cently published by the U. S. Depart
ment of Agriculture:
The test in which two cows were
pastured during the season of 1914 on
three quarter acre plats of mixed
grasses was continued during 1915.
Two of these plats were seeded in
1913, one to a mixture of awnless
brome-grass, orchard grass, perennial
rye-grass, meadow fescue tall fescue
Italian rye-grass Kentucky blue-grass
and tall oat-grass and the other to
the same mixture of grasses with the
addition of alsike clover and white
clover. The third plat in the test
was seeded in 1911 to a mixture of
awnless brome-grass, orchard grass,
redtop, and timothy. In this test the
two plats seeded in 1913 were placed,
in one inclosure and pastured alter
nately with the one plat seeded 1911
The cows were on the pasture contain
ing the two plats for periods of from
10 days to two weeks and on the sin
gle plat for periods of five to seven
days. Irrigation was applied when
ever necessary to each part of the
pasture as soon as the cows were re
moved. In 1915 each part was irrigat
ed seven times. One-half of each
pint of the pasture was top-dressed
with stable manure at the rate of 10
tons per acre in the fall of 1914. The
The pasture period extended from
Ap il 28 to October 8. During this
time two grade Jersey cows were used
They were kept off pasture during
s. nmy weather ;"o1 an aggregate of
beneficial effect of this treatment on
the growth of the pasture was very
apraruent c.oing the pasturing scason.
it Jays, so thac they were actually
on the pasture 150 days. On the
days that they were off pasture each 1
cow was fed 25 pounds of alfalfa hay
a day. The pasture furnished ample
feed for the cows until September 1.
From that date to the end of the pas
turing period each cow was fed 15
poiunds of alfalfa hay a day in ad
dition to the pasture.
One of the cows freshened in octo
ber, 1914, so she was milking at the
beginning of the test. She became)
dry by September 15 and calved a
gain on October 15. The other cow
freshened on June 25, so she was dry
during the first part of the test. The
cow that was giving milk at the begin
ning of the test was given a supple
mental feed of 6 pounds of chopped
corn a day from the beginning of the
pasture period to June 15, and the
ether cow received no grain until July
1. From July 1 to October 14, during
the first half of each month, each
cow was fed daily 6 pounds of a grain
mixture consisting of equal parts of
chopped corn, wheat, and oats. No
grain was fed during the second half
of each month. The increase in milk
flow during the period when grain
was fed was in no case sufficient to
pay for the grain.
The cows produced during the sea
son of 164 days a total of 5,247 pounds
of butter fat. At the local market
prices, the value of the butter fat
produced was $52.07. During the en
tire period a total of 882 pounds of
grain and 1,630 pounds of hay was fed
If the hay be valued at $6 a ton and
the grain at $1.25 per hundredweight,
the total cost of the supplemental
feed was $15.92. This amount, de
ducted from $52.07, the value of the
butter fat, leaves a return of $36.15
for the pasturage produced on three
fourths of an acre. This is at the
rate of $48.20 per acre.
The carrying capacity of these
three quarter-acre plats in 1914 was
the same as in 1915. Two cows were
carried through the pasturage season
each year on the three fourths of an
acre. This is at the rate of eight
cows on three acres. The results in
1915 indicate that the pastures are
improving with age. These facts, as
well as the return of $48.20 per acre
secured in 1915, show clearly that ir
rigated pastures can be made success
ful on the Huntley project.
Getting Some Return From Irrigat
ed Pastures The First Year.
In the same report the writer dis
cusses a preliminary test to deter
mine whether any returns can be
gotten from irrigated pastures during
the first year, when ordinarily such
pastures are not used. He says:
"A preliminary test was made of
light pasturing during the latter part
of the season of 1915. One of the
quarter acre plats that was planted'
without a nurse crop was pastured
during the latter part of the season.
On August 27, 1915, a yearling heifer
was placed on the quarter acre plat,
where she' remained until October 30
except during eight stormy days,
when she.was kept up and fed alfalfa
hay at the rate of 20 pounds a day.
While she was kept on pasture no hay
or grain was fed. The quarter acre
plat furnished abundant feed for a
total of 58 days. The weight of the
heifer at the beginning of the test
was 616 pounds and at the close 730
pounds, the gain being 114 pounds.
If this be valued at 5 cents a pound,
the gain made was worth $5.70 from
the quarter acre, or at the rate of
$22.80 per acre for the first year's
pasture.
"At the time the test was started,
the grasses averaged 10 to 12 inches
in height and had formed a heavy sod.
While the growth of the grasses was
very light during October, the heavy
growth at the beginning of the test
was sufficient to furnish grazing dur
ing the entire period. The carrying
capacity, which was at the rate of
four yearling heifers per acre, was
certainly satisfactory.
"The season appeared to be un
usually favorable for starting grasses
and the growth made was unusually
good. It is doubtful whether such
good returns could be expected as a
rule during the first year. What the
effect of the early grazing will be can
not be finally determined until next
season, but at the close of the pastur
ing period in October, 1915, no bad
effects were apparent."
"Weak In Faith"
C. A. Windle, editor of Brann's Icon
oclast, made an anti-prohibition talk in
Xfissoula Tuesday night. He is cred
ited with making a talk that pleased
the audience. Among other things, he
declared that the prohibitionists either
want to prohibit others and not them
selves, or are weak in faith. "Im
agine," he said, "a man singing 'Safe
in the Arms of Jesus' and then asking
for a legal straight jacket to keep him
out of the gutter." This undoubtedly
had reference to the part of the pro
posed law exempting from its workings
wines for sacramental purposes.
SCHOOL NOTES
There was a large crowd pres
ent at the school dance last Sat
urday night. Every one report
ed a good time and all admired
the new building and also the
calcimining. Receipts were $130,
of which $90 was cleared. This
went to pay for the calcimining
and trimming.
The basket ball goals have
been erected on the athletic field
and the teams have begun prac
tice. On account of the dust a
few loads of saw dust will be
put on the field.
Miss Irene Teagarden was
called home to Missoula Tuesday
by the illness of her mother. We
hope her illness will not prove
serious and that we will have
Miss Teagarden with us soon.
PRIMARY NOTES
The best readers this week are
Leta and Lyda Spooner and
Georgian Eckley.
We are cutting and painting
Jack-o'Lanterns, witches, black
cats and goblins.
The primary children have
learned, "The Raggedy Man"
and "My Shadow" and enjoy
both poems.
Each child has an "outdoor"
book, into which he puts pressed
flowers, leaves and pictures of
the outdoor world.
Last week the Pioneer stated
that Miss Geraldine Harvey was
seriously injured in an automobile
accident which occurred last
Saturday afternoon, a week ago,
and would probably lose the use
of her arm. We are pleased to
correct the statement. Miss
Harvey suffered no serious con
sequences and her arm has fully
recovered from the damage.
On receipt of word yesterday
that his brother was dangerously
ill at his home in North Dakota,
F. J. White left immediately for
that place. He will be gone about
a week.
$150,000 MORE
FOR YEAR 1811
C, F. Rathbone received a telegram
Tuesday night from Hon. Henry L.
Myers, dated Anaconda, Montana, Oct.
17, as follows:
"Just received telegram from In
terior Department at Washington say
ing that the department had estimated
and recommended appropriation of
$750,000 for Flathead project for next
year, and sure it will be carried."
This is more good news for the peo
ple of this valley. With only a start
made on the expenditure of the $750,
000 appropriated for this year and the
same amount practically assured for
1917, the final completion of the Flat
head project at an early date appears
assured. More than this, with $1,500,
000 of government money being ex
pended on the Flathead and also the
amount necessary for the construction
of the Northern Pacific from Dixon to
Ronan and on to Poison, there should
be good times for everypody.
Senator Myers has been a persistent
and faithful worker for money to com
plete this project and has succeeded in
securing larger appropriations by con
gress than any other representative
sent to the senate or house from Mon
tana. His fight nas practically single
hahded. Senator Walsh assisted to a
certain extent in the senate, but it fell
to Senator Myers to do most of the
work in that body and all of the work
in the house. His efforts should, and
undoubtedly will, be thoroughly appre
ciated by every resident of this section.
PROPERTY VALUATION
SHOWS A DIG GAIN
Montana's total property valuation
this year is $487,898,353, an increase in
one year of $48,112,435, according to a
compilation made by J. J. Ryan, clerk
of the state board of equalization, up
on the equalized assessment returns
of all counties in the state. Railroad
property last year was assessed at
$79,195,951, this year at $81,043,541.
One of the most significant things in
the report attesting to the remark
able growth of the state in an agricul
tural way, is the increase in the nun
ber of acres of land assessed. In 1915
the assessors returned 28,842,624
acres, this year 32,565,923 acres.
The details follow:
Personal property, livestock exclud
ed, $91,485,872.
Total value of livestock, $52,384,484
Real estate and improvements, $262,
984,581.
Town lots, $35,204,920.
Improvements on town lots, $46,092,
866.
Total value of horses, $19,516,004.
Total value of cattle, $24,911,527.
Total value of sheep, $7,429,161.
Total value of hogs, $520,780.

Mrs. Etta Meller of Rockford,
Illinois, and Mr. A. Sutherland
of Ronan, were married at Trin
ity M. E. parsonage in Butte,
Rev. J. G. Ross officiating, on
October 12.
Mr. and Mrs. Sutherland ar
rived in Ronan on Friday and
commenced housekeeping im
mediately in Mr. Sutherland's
commodious home. The mar
riage was a surprise to most
people of Ronan and vicinity but
all will join in congratulations
and offer Mrs. Sutherland a
hearty welcome to Ronan.
RAILROAD WORK
NOW UNDER WAY
C. W. McNamara of Pierpont, S. D.,
who has the contract for seven miles
of grading between Crow creek and
Mud creek, arrived in Ronan the latter
part of last week with his grading out
fit and commenced throwing dirt Mon
day morning.
A camp has been established just
south of Alex Laflemme's ranch and
the first dirt to move in this vicinity on
the N. P. extension from Dixon to Pol
son was in that neighborhood. So far
only about twenty-five men are employ
ed but we understand the force will be
iricteased in the very near future to
about seventy-five men.
Mr. McNamara expects to be able to
wprk all winter, or until his contract is
completed. With a force on both ends
og the line and others in the middle, it
loiks very much as if the grading
would practically be all completed by
early spring and the long sought rail
rqad for this valley will be an actual
reality.
W. E. MOORE, CANDIDATE
FOR COUNTY AlTORNEY
W. E, Moore, candidate on the
republican ticket for county at
torney, declares for impartial,
honest, and fearless enforcement
of the laws without fear of, or
favor to, any class. His record
and experience for 23 years as an
active practicing attorney, andas
county attorney of Granite coun
ty for two terms, has qualified
him to realize the importance of
such declaration.
The office of county attorney is
one of first importance to the peo
ple of the county. Aside from
his duty to prosecute, in behalf
of the people. all offenses of a
criminal nature, the county at
torney is the legal adviser of the
board of county commissioners
and all other county and district
officers. The prudent business
man, when seeking legal services,
always seeks the most experienc
ed counsel to be had. It should
not be different in affairs con
cerning the public. It is a busi
ness proposition as well with the
county as with private affairs.
For this reason the most experi
enced attorney that can be induc
ed to accept the nomination
should be chosen county attor
ney.
It is the duty of the county at
torney to avoid extravagance in
the conduct of his office as well
as to require this to be done by
other county officers. And this
duty can be best performed by
an active, energetic attorney who
is experienced in the work and
duties of the office.
Mr. Moore has resided and
practiced his profession at Mis
soula since 1910. Prior to that
he resided and practiced at Phil
ipsburg, Granite county.

Farmers Will Pay the Bill
Henry N. Pope, of the Asso
ciation of State Presidents of
Farmers' Unions, flays the rail
road law enacted by congress.
He says the bill to grant the
four brotherhoods of trainmen's
unions 25 per cent increase in
wages will be evened up by in
creased freights. He says the
farmers stand for a fair wage
for labor and capital on all oper
ations of handling their products
from the farm to the consumer.
He says if the government is go
ing to fix wages for any one
class of railroad employees,, it
should fix them for all classes
without favor. He says the
sectionmen, shopmen and farm
labor are far more deserving of
a raise than the Big Four Train
men's Union, already highly
paid. . Of course, Mr. Pope will
be accused by radicals and agi
tators of being brought up and
controlled by the railroads. He
says:
"All those who work upon the
farm labor from twelve to four
teen hours a day. The condition
of women laborers in the field
today is worse than it was dur
ing slavery.
"Not a word has been spoken
by congress in defense of the
woman who makes the hay and
gathers the sheaves, and little
has been done that has increased
the income of the farmer or en
abled him to pay a higher wage
to his laborers.
"But today we find the highest
paid laborers in the world, mak
ing three times more money than
farmers, demanding a 25 per
cent increase and congress has
tening to their relief. This in
crease must in the end rest upon
the backs of the farmers and
will reduce their incomes, in
crease their hours of labor, and
call for another levy of farm
mothers from the home to the
field."
Old Resident Dies
Alexander Morigeanu, one of
the oldest residents'of this part
of Montana, died at the hospital
in Missoula last Sunday evening.
He had resided at Arlee for
many years and' was 81 years,

eral services were held in the
Catholic church at St. Ignatius
Wednesday and interment made
in the cemetery at that place.
Mr. Morigeau is survived by
his wife, five sons, Joseph Mor
igeau of Camas, Antoine Mor
igeau of Ronan, Eli Morigeau of
Ravalli and John and Octave
Morigeau of Arlee, and by four
daughters. These are Mrs. Allen
Sloan of Sloan's Ferry. Mrs.
Gabriel LeBoeuff of Dixon, Mrs.
Alphonse Clairmont and Mrs.
John'iClairmont of Ronan, all of
whom were present at the fun
eral.
Democratic Ladies' Rally
The rally held by the demo
cratic ladies of Ronan and vicin
ity at Scearce hall Monday night
was a grand success.
Mrs. Chas. H. Hall was the
first speaker and gave a fifteen
minute talk devoted principally
to praise of President Wilson.
Mrs. Tylar B. Thompson fol
lowed with a half hour address
eulogistic of the president and
criticising the Ladies' Congres
sional Union for their action in
opposing every democrat because
the democratic party had not
passed the Susan B. Anthony
amendment.
At the conclusion of the ad
dress a Ladies' Woodrow Wilson
club was formed, with Mrs. J. J.
Maloney as chairman, Mrs. J. C.
Curtis vice-chairman, and Mrs.
E. D. Swisher secretary. Twelve
ladies joined the club.

Community Prosperity
Encourage investments of pri
vate capital on equal terms with
what is called public ownership.
The people have a right to
full benefits of both systems and
open competition is best for all.
Private capital should not be
used to.prevent public ownership
nor public ownership to destroy
private investments.
Discourage laws and regula
tions that impose hardships on
industries or prevent employ
ment of largest number at labor.
Leave as much to individual
enterprise and initiative as pos
sible so as to get the highest
efficiency of every citizen.
Keep down the number of of
fices, the overhead expense, and
inject as much business as pos
sible into public service.
Public expenditures for needed
improvements honestly expended
are a benefit to every citizen and
all property.
Do not pass laws to stop the
people moving about, spending
money or doing business with
each other on legitimate' lines.
Support the home industry, the
home enterprise and the home
merchant as the golden rule of
community prosperity.
Chas. N. Pray Meeting
Hon. Chas. N. Pray, republican can
didate for U. S. senator, received a
hearty welcome in Ronan last night
when he addressed an audience of some
200 people in the opera house. He was
accompanied by Mrs. Pray. After the
meeting Mr. A. M. Sterling drove them
to Ravalli in order for Mr. Pray to catch
the early morning train for Deer
Lodge. Mr. Pray spoke on general
topics and also on matters of local in
terest on the reservation,
PARTY NOT SOLID FOR
CONGRESSIONAL NOMINEE
"I was very much surprsed to find
in this state a decided opposition on
the part of the women and ever so
many men so the election of the wom
en candidates in the state," said Elita
beth Freeman ,one of the Hughe's ali
ance party in Helena. "I was almost
ordered not to mention suffrage or
Miss Rankin's candidacy while in Mon
tana, for people told me that if I did
I would ruin what republican harmony
there is here."
Elizabeth Freeman-she asked that
no "Miss" precede her name-was ab
solutely frank in her statement of the
conditions in Montana and she even
went so far as to say, "I often wonoer
if this work I am doing isn't useless.
I am more and more discouraged as
the days pass."
According to this woman, equal suf
frage will eventually come in this
country "despite the women and de
spite the work of the suffragists.' She
lamented the fact that in the ranks of
the suffrage workers there is much
discord and trouble.
The question asked her was:
Frankly, Miss Freeman, is there petty
fighting going on in the suffrage
ranks?"
"I regret very much to say that
there is. Women have not learned to
settle their troubles as men have, and
they insist on airing their soiled linen
where all may see. It is hurting the
cause and discouraging the earnest
workers," was the way she answered.
A particular hobby of this workeris
the eradication of the unfit. "I wisn.
itwere possible some way to prevent
all breeding in this country for 10
years. The degenerates are piling up
in huge quantities and something must
be done to check their increase," she
said.
