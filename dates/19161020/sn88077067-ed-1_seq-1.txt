Spilled the Beans at Battle
Creek, Michigan
Hopewell German Voter Not Fool
ed by Alliance Declaration
and Other float-back.
The endorsement of Chas. E.
Hughes for President of the United
States by tho German-American Alli
ance should not be taken to seriously
on November 7th, l'Jlfi, by the
German American voters. A little
careful thinking will convince any
German - American that Chas. E.
Hughes Is supported In bis campaign
by those most hating Germany and
the German people and Is also sup
ported by Wall Street.
How about T. Roosevelt? He Is
tho blackest of the German enemies.
There isn't one bit of a doubt when
the money lenders of this country are
placing their money in this campaign.
They are placing It with the Republi
can party. Why? Because they could
not Influence Woodrow Wilson to
come their way and do their bidding.
The submarine controversy has
been settled long ago. That contro
versy Is seorchlngly denounced by
Roosevelt, who claimed at Battle
Creek, Mich., that ho would have seiz
ed all German ships Interned In
America. That would have meant
war with Germany, and Roosevelt Is
supporting Chas. E. Hughes for Pres
ident. Now, Mr. Voter, do you want war?
If so. Vote for Chas. E .Hughes for
President. If not, cast your ballot
for Woodrow Wilson for President of
the United States.
Where Is there a President since
Washington who had more to contend
with than our President, Woodrow
Wilson, of today.
The Foreign war, the Mexican trou-.
bie and we are still at peace with the
world. What would It have been had
T. R. been elected President of the
United States. It would have been
war and plenty of it, you may bet.
Now, Mr. Voter, if you are for
peace and prosperity make your cross
in the circle on the Democratic ticket
ami let the Rooster do the scratching.
Yours,
A GERMAN VOTER.

STILL THEY GOME
lIC. GLADDEN (JIVES WILSON HIS
BALLOT
'leigyinim Says Democrat Now
ler Represent Progressive
Democracy
tel.
Rev. Dr. Washington Gladden, for
years regarded as strongly Republi
can in his political attitude, has an
nounced ills intention to vole for Pre
sident Wilson at the coming election.
In making the announcement Rev.
Dr. Gladden states as his strongest
reasons that the ideas and principles
of progressive democracy are better
represented at the coming election by
the Democratic party and Its leaders
than by the Republcan parly nnd Its
leaders.
Mv first vote lor president was
cast for Abraham Lincoln in 1860,
be said. "In 1!U2 I voted for Roose
velt, with the Progressives.
Took Downward Step
"For many years I have felt great
admiration for Mr. Hughes and I re
joiced to see him elevated to what
seemed to me the summit of a law
yer's ambition a seat upon the su
preme bench.
No man can ever leave that emi
nence for party leadership without
stepping down, and I was gratified
when Justice Hughes, In his corres
pondence with Rabbi Wise two or
three years ago, seemed to make It
clear that such was his conviction.
"I confess that my opinion of Judge
Iluuhes was perceptibly lowered
when, on the supreme bench, he ob
viously kept that possibility open,
and subsequent events have not reas
sured me.
"I do not think that ex-President
Eliot (of Harvard) has overstated the
ease when he says: 'Anyone who sur
veys the extraordinary series of legis
lation and Executive acts accomplish
ed by the Democratc partv in three
years and a half will realize two
things: First, that. President Wilson
has proved himself a party leader of
unusual power; second that the party
thus led has done much more for the
country than the Republican party ac
complished in five times as many
years.'
"I have not been In entire sympa
thy with all of Mr. Wilson's policies.
I regretted the extent to which he
yielded to the mania for prepared
ness, but that was a popular craze
which it was difficult to stand against,
and the Republicans and their leaders
were more responsbie for it than the
Democrats.
Wanton Attacks Start
"The moderation and rationlity ex
hibited by Mr. Wilson In the conduct
of our national affairs were almost
universally recognized by our people
during the first year of the war; most
of us heard during all that time from
iiK'ti of all parties the warmest ex
pressions of gratitude that the helm
was in the hands of a sane and jud
cial leader.
"When the election drew near the
caldron began to bubble. It was in
evitable that the most reasonless and
wanton attacks would be made upon
the president; at a time when the na
ton ought to be standing firmly to
gether, all the resources of party poli
tics are drawn upon to discredit our
nutonal leader."
Look over the flock of former Re
publicans and subsequent Progres
sives who are now in line for Wilson
Thos. A. Edison, Luther Burbank,
Dr. Gladden, Henry Ford, Balnbridge
Colby, Judge Ben Lindsey, Francis J.
Heney, Jane Addams, President Em
eritus Charles W. Eliot of Harvard,
John Burrough the naturlist, J. A.
Hopkins and scores of others. And
La Follette is on the Republican list
running for another term In the sen
ate with a platform of "I supported
Wilson."
BURBANK OUT FOR WILSON,
"THE GREATEST STATESMAN"
Announcing his support of President
Wilson, Luther Burbank. the horticul
turist wizard of Cullforula. said:
"I believe him to be the greatest
statesman we have ever had."
Mr. Burbank. the Edison of scientific
horticulture, declared that without re
serve he Indorsed the position announc
ed a week earlier by Thomas A. Edi
son. 'Both Burbank and Edison have
been lifelong Republicans. Edition put
It this war:
"Times ore too serious to talk In
terms of Republicanism or Democracy.
When it's America that is at stake
men have got to vote as"Amerienns. A
fool or a coward would have had the
United States in all sorts of trouble.
As It is, we are at peace, the country
was never more prosperous, and we
have the strength that comes with hon
nr and Integrity of purpose."

I saw a lad the other day
Go by with a droplng head.
With a tired look und gloomy eyes
And slow and weury tread.
I linked him what the matter was,
lie raised his tired eyes,
And Hald, I'm dead discouraged.
That's where the trouble lies.
Now Ktrunge as It may seem to you,
My heart wuu full of Joy
In hearing him say just those words;
I'll tell you why my boy.
It showed ho was not satisfied
With his own life, you see.
And what applies to him may well
Apply to you and me.
The lad who goes ahead cock sure,
And thinks that he's ail right;
Who goes ahead In blind conceit.
Puts up a losng fight.
And so when you are feeling blue,
Ami life looks dull and sad.
Remember what I tell you,
And then cheer up, my lad.
Discouragements are bound to come,

To help us In the fray;
So brace up, lads, there's lots of hope

said ditch assessment on the 1916 du

PROVISIONS
Gf New Pension Law for Widows
of Civil War Veterans Ex
plained by Official.
Because of considerable confusion
in regard to the provisions of the
law, the following Interpretation of
the provisions of the act has been pre
pared by H. L. Williams, of Indiana
polis, special pension examiner:
"The new pension law, approved
September 8, 1916, does not grant an
increase to all Civil war widows, but
only to those who are 70 years old,
except when the widow was married
to the soldier before he was discharg
ed from the service, In which case
the pension is increased to $20 per
month regardless of age.
"The second section of the act
gives pension to those who were wi
dows of Civil war soldiers and who
lost their title because of remarriage,
but who are again widows or divorced
from their last husbands on their own
applications and wthout fault on their
part.
"The third section of the act allows
pensions to all widows of soldiers
who served as long as ninety days
during the Civil war and were hon
orably discharged regardless of the
cause of soldier's death, provided the
marriage to the soldier took place
prior to June 27, 1905. (Prior to this
law, this date was June 2, 1890.)
"The divorced wife of a soldier, on
the death of the latter, is not entitled
to a pension under any law.
"To sum up briefly, a Civil war wi
dow is entitled to $20 a month when
she teaches the age of seventy. If
she marr'ed a soldier before his dis
charge she is entitled to said rate re
gardless (f her age.
"All widows of Civil war soldiers
who served ninety days ,etc, are en
titled to pensions If they were mar
ried prior to June 27, 1905, the rate
to be determned by the age of the
widow.
"In order to scute the Increase al
lowed by the law, a widow pensioner
should .'If s'je has not already done
sol write a letter to 'The Commiss
ioner of Feiificns, Washington, D. C
giving the number of her pension
certificate, the name of the soldier,
his company and regiment, the date
and place of her bhth and her pres
ent pcstortice address.
"Her pension certificate should not
be sent."
In remitting a renewal to The De
mocrat from Mulberry, Has., Dallas
B. Jenkins, a former Mercer County
boy, writes: "Am sending a Kansas
dollar for another year's reading. Am
still on a big steam shovel for the
Roy Milliner Coal Co. Had a Dig
ram Friday, the 14th, first since in
June. No crops to amount to any
thing nothing but sunflowers."
At the district convention of the
Women's Foreign Missionary Society,

Miss Cynthia Newcomb, of Center
