The sufJerdreadnaught Arizona, lat
est addition to the Atlantic tleet and
enc cf the most powerful Ships in the
world, has just entered the service of
Uncle Sam, fully, manned and ready
fcr action. This addition to 'the navy
is far from a clear gain in strength,
however, since t was necessary to
strip three other battleships of their,
crews and place them In reserve to
find a full complement of men for the
new fighter.
The 911 man who make up the crew
of the Arizona were formerly on the

Episcopal House of Bishops Re
jects Two Proposals.

Another Request That Women Be Al
lowed Membership In Hankow
Bishop's Advisory Council Is Denied.
Optional Use of Commandments In
Full or Shortened Form Suggested
Prayer of George Washington.
St Louis. Oct. 19. In two actions
taken by the house of bishops of the
Protestant Episcopal general conven
tion hero, women wero denied equal
rights with men.
A proposal to permit women .to sit
ts delegate in the general conven
tion was rejected, while a reque3
from the lit. Ilev. Logan II. Roots,
bishop of Hankow, to be allowed to
fcdmit women to membership In, his
advisory council, was denied. The
house sugptt d to the bishop of Han
kow. It was stated, that he might ere-
te an auxiliarv rouiicil of women.
The prrT-ncal to give women equal
rights with men In the convpntion
was sponsored bv Robert H. Gardiner
of Gardiner. Mp. A similar resolution
Is now on the ralondar of thfe house
of deputies, aud It was pointed out
that action In the upper house does
not preclude It being discussed In the
lower bod Since concurrence of tho
two houses Is necessary, in the event
tho house of deputies should appro e
the proposal it will go to the house of
bishops for reconsideration.
The house of bishops, which also
considered changes recommended In
the communion Ben-ice by the com
mission on the book of common
prayer, will suggest In Its report to
the house of deputies that the Ten
Commandmpnts be printed in th.
prayer book In both their shortened
form and in their full form and that
clergymen be given optional use of
either in the service. It was stated
The committee had recommended that
five of the commandments bo short
ened, as read in the communion ser
vice, by the elimination of the rea
sons. Efforts to have the prayer of George
Washington, uttered upon tho occa
sion of his laying down the supremo
command of the federal armies, adopt
ed and substituted for thb present
prayer "for our country," In the book
of common prayer, were inaugurated
in the house of deputies by Roland S.
