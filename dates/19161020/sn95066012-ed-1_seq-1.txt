SIX ESCAPE AT SING SING
Convict in Uniform Fooled Guard at
Gate.
Ossining, Oct. 19. Six prisoners
escaped today from Sing Sing prison,
the largest jail delivery in the history
of the institution.
At 9 o'clock tonight the leaner, Mar
quis Curtis, was captured by the
guards within a quarter of a mile of
John D. Rockefeller's estato at Pocan
tico Hills. Curtis was shot, through
the stomach when he attempted to lire
on the pursuing guards. Ho may die.
At midnight armed guards were

They believe the other five members
of the bands are in hiding nearby.

lagers that the six fugitives bought
provisions a few hours previously.
The six long term prisoners left the

BREMEN IS LOST
Submarine a Month Overdue is Given
Up
Washington, Oct. 19. Loss of the
German submarine merchantman Bre
men was conceded today by ranking
Teutonic diplomats in position to be
familiar with the movements of the
vessel. The Bremen is now one month
overdue. She was commanded by
Catp. Schwarzkopf and carried a crew
of approximately twenty-five men.
It was admitted that German offi
cials, not only In this country but in
Berlin were without definite informa
tion as to the fate of the Bremen. All
they know is that she set out for
America from Bremerhaven and that
she Bhould have arrived at an Ameri
can port soon after the middle of last
month.
Dissappearance of the Bremen will
not cause abandonment of the project
to send marchant submarines regular
ly from Germany to the United States,
it was said. There appeared to be
reason to expect that another subsea
freighter, either the Deutchland or an
other, would reach an American port
within the next month.
German officials in Washington do
not believe the Bremen could have
fallen into the hands of the British un
less she had some accident to her ma
chinery. They pointed out that, un
like naval submarines, merchant sub
marines avoid all localities frequent
by shipping and therefore not open to
the same risks.
One official said it was considered
most likely the Bremen had met the
fate of a number of naval submarines
which had sailed from port never to
be heard from again.
Another argument advanced in sup
port of the belief that the Bremen had
met with an accident rather than cap
ture was that she had aboard a num
ber of important documents for the
German Embassy here, which proba
bly would have been made public had
they fallen into the hands of the Brit
ish. ORRINE SAVED

VON KLUCK IS RETIRED
German Commander Who Failed to
. Take Paris
Berlin, via London, Oct. 19. Field
Marshal Alexander H. R. von Kluck,
who commanded the right wing of the
German army in its sweep toward Par
is in the fall of 1914, has been placed
on the retired list at his own request.
He had never returned to the front
since he was wounded by shrapnel in
March. 1915. The field marshal was
70 years old last May.
Field Marchal von Kluck, who led
the first German army up lo within
thirty miles of Paris, was the most
conspicous German officer in the early
part of the war. He led the German
advance into France and swept on to
ward Paris until the Fernch captial
was moved to Bordeaux, and it seem
ed certain that the city would have to
stand a siege.
Then, when it seemed as if no hu
man power could stop the advance,
the tide began to turn. Von Kluck
veered to the east instead of continu
ing in a direct line toward Paris. In
the latter part of September, 1914, the
advance was checked slightly, the Al
lies pushed the German line back just
a little and then on September 22 the
Germans began to march land.
The French followed up their slight
gains with an army that came out
from Parjs in taxicabs, touring cars
andauto trucks, and struck at Von
Kluck's flank, driving him back across
the Marne In one of the great battles
of modern warfare. In all that retire
ment of the German forces Von Klurk's
command, which was the right wing
of the advance, became the buffer for
the violent attacks of the Allies.
Gen. von Kluck was severely criti
cised when the tide turned against
him for not pushing his advance
straight on into Paris. His critics
said he felt so sure that he would lead
an army of occupation into Paris with
in a week that he relaxed and rested
for a day, and on that day the Allies
gained their foothold to strike back
successfully. He has been quoted as
saying just before the battle of the
Marne that he would be in Paris with
in eight days.
Gen. von Kluck is said to have been
wounded in March, 1915, by recklessly
exposing himself after a stormy inter
view with Emperor William. It was
reported last August that he was soon
ta take command on the eastern front.
His son. Lieut. Egon von Kluck, was
reported killed at Middelkarke early
in 1915.
Gen. von Kluck wa3 born in Muen
ster, Germany, May 20. 184(i, and en
tered the army in 1816. He fought
in the war with Austria In 1SG6 and
in' the Franco-Prussian war in 1870.
In the Franco-Prussian war he was
wounded twice. He has an iron cross
of the second class.

Paris, Oct. 20. French, artillery and
machine guns control the streets of
Athens but there has been no further
disorder. The Greeks arrested by the

To the north and east of Sailly
Saillisel, where the French have ad
vanced their line in the past lew days
at what (he Berlin war office asserts
was a cost in casualties not com
mensurate with the gain, the Germans
have made violent counterattacks,
which were repulsed by the French.
Berlin admits that in their attacks
oil tho Sars-Morval front the British
captured German positions, but says
these later were retaken. Heavy rains
fell yesterday on the British front,
and except for a slight gain at Butte
de Warlencourt and the repulse of a
German counter-attack there, compar
ative quiet prevailed with theBritish.

or the Russians in the violent fighting
that has been going on for several
days In Volliynia and Galicia. The
Petrcgrad war office says that near
KIselin and Sviniusky, in Volhynia
violent attacks by the Teutonic allies
were repulstd, while Berlin records
the capture of Russian trenches on the
west bank of the Stokhod and the re,
pulse, with heavy casualties, of
Russian attacks near Bubnow. South
of Zborow, in Galicia, several enter
prises have been carried out success
fully by the Austrian, whilo at other
points Russian attacks were put down.
Having held the Teutonic allies in
the mountain passes on the Transylvania-Rumania
border lor several
days, tho Rumanians have taken the
offensive at various points and are
now declared to bo pushing back their
adversaries, who are leaving prisoners
and guns in the hands of tho Ruman

statement by the assertion that the
Austro-Gernians are engaged in suc
cessful lighting in the mountain
passes.
Generally speaking, there is no
change in the situation in Macedonia,
although botli the entente and Teu
tonic allies make claim to minor suc

Except on Mt. Pasubio, in the

taking place in the Austro-ltallan
theater.

the amount, according to the will of
her aunt, Sylvia Ann Howland, and at
her death to be distributed among tho
heirs of her grandfather. For over
35 years Mr. Russell has assisted the

Roughly Handled.

CABBAGE PATCH
John Squires Achieves Spectacu
lar Results from 12-Acre Plot
VEGETABLES .WORTH $42 A TON
Two Carloads Already Sold Harvest
ing Shows Patch Will Return)
Average of 17 1-2 Tons to the Aero l
A Vermont cabbage patch worth
$8000 more than enougn to pay for
the 177-acre farm from which the
crop is being harvested is a sight
that Is attracting considerable atten
tion these days just west or Old Ben
nington. The patch, 12 acres of it, is
on the farm of John Squires who
moved back to Vermont about two
years ago from Skeneatles, N. Y.
Cabbages are high this year and the
prices are likely to reach even greater
heights. Mr. Squires has already
sold two 'carloads of his crop for
$42.50 a ton. He says that there Isn't
an acre in the patch that will harvest
'.ess than 15 tons and some of them
will yield as much as 20 tons. Sup
posing the patch averages 17 1-2 tona
to the acre. This would make the
total for the whole 12 acres 210 tons.
If cabbage is worth $42 a ton In the
market it doen't take a large amount
of figuring to show a gross income of
better than eight thousand dollars.
Mr. Squires says that the larger
part of the labor In producing the crop
was in the planting. The plants were
set with tlie aid of a machine and all
of this work was done by Mr. Squires
and his two daughters. Harvesting
and hauling to the car will, involve
some labor and expense but not
much more than would be required in
the handling cf other farm crops.
This is not the llrst time that Mr.
Squires has raised cabbages. He was
formerly a resident of Manchester
where he owned a farm which he sold
about five years ago to Robert T. Lin
coln and which is now a part of the
Lincoln estate. After disposing of
the Manchester property he bought
the farm on which he is now harvest
ing the big crop of cabbages and paid
$5000 for it. There were good build
ings on the place and the land was in
a fair state of cultivation. Because,
of the death of Mrs. Squire's father at
Skeneatles he moved to that town and
for nearly three years carried on a
farm owned by the family.
Skeneatles is in the cabbage belt
and tons of the vegetables are raised
there each year and Bhipped to nearby
saurkraut factories., Like the other
farmers in and about Skeneatles, he
raised cabbage and thus acquired a
knowledge of the business.
Mrs. Squires' mother died about two
years ago. the estate was settled and
the farm sold and the family returned
to Vermont to take up their home on
the place at Old Bennington which
had not received all the attention it
required during their absence but was
still in fairly good shape.
Soon after Mr. Squires' return to
Bennington he expressed the opinion
that the soil in tills vicinity was far
superior to that of central New York
state for the raising of cabbage. He
not only believed that natural condi
tions were better but he was confident
that vegetables higher in quality and
more In number could be raised here
for the reason that the crop was a
new one. In the Skeneatles country,
he said, cabbage has been the main
rarming industry for years and as a
result the soil has become infected
with the diseased condition that fol
lows the continual raising of one crop.
The results attained prove that his
faith in Vermont as a cabbage country
has been verified.
His cabbage patch is not his first
unusual farming exploit. Last year
Mr. Squires planted a section of land
to wheat, a crop not much raised In
Vermont, and secured some startling
results.
