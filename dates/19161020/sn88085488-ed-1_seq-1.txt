VOLUME XXVIII
IS. C. LOSES FIRST
CONFERENCE GAME
Washington State on Short End of
. 13-10 Scoif Through Inability
to Hold the Hall
For the first time since the ad
vent^f Coach "Lonestar" Dletz to
\V. S. C. the Crimson and Gray
bowed before a conference rival Sat
urday afternoon when O. A. C.
emerged victorious from a spectacu
lar, hard fought game, by a score of
13 •to 10. Largely instrumental in
the downfall f last year's Pacific
Coach champions was "Tuffy" Conn,
midget Freshman halfback for the
visitors, whoso brilliant open field
running, return of punts and unerr
ing drop kicking ability made victory
possible. The' O. A. C. star was ma
terially aided and abetted by W. S.
C's numerous fumbles, five of which
(ell Into the hands of their oppon
ents at inopportune moments. Every
0. A. C. score was the result of a
(arable, Gill taking the- ball over for
a touchdown and the first score after
Ui minutes of play in the first period
after Doane**had fumbled on W. i 4»
C's 20-yard line.
Durham gave W. S. C. three In the
second period with a drop hick from
the 40-yard line, but Conn more than
evened the score by drop-kicking
from the 30-yard live in the third
quarter and added •another of the
same variety from the same distance
in the final period. With the score
13 to ,'1 against them, the W. S. C.
men, with a fresh backfield of new
material, played all around their op
ponents in tho final period. Brown,
Skadan, Glover, and Loom is carrying
the ball 59 yards, only to lose it on
a fumble near the coveted goal. Af
ter Anderson's punt the procession
started again. A 16-yard run by
Brown, 10-yard pass. Clover to
Boone, another for IS yards. Boone
to Hanley, gave W. S. C. only goal.
Boone then carried the ball over and
kicked the goal. After three plays
by 0. A. C. had netted no gain the
whistle sounded and W. S. C.'s spurt
was brought to an abrupt ending..
Although outcharged, outpunted,
and outgeneraled, all the breaks of
luck were with the speedy, shifty O.
A. C. eleven. The \V. S. C. backs
carried the ball over two yards to one
forO. A. C, and the defeat must be
charged to 11 costly fumbles, with
every member of the backfield con
tributing to the error column.
Brooks, 0. A. C, right tackle, was the
visitors' line star, breaking up many
*' S. C plays. The playing of
Captain Bangs at left half was hardly
UP to his standard, although Boone
shone brightly except for fumbles.
Brown, substituted for Quarter
back Durham in the third period,
reeled off several long runs, and Ska
ton and Glover both advanced the
ba'l for good gains. Langdon, the
rangy w S. C. center, made several
»d pastes which were responsible
w some of the fumbles.
Coach Pip a i of O. A. c has round
« out a quad of green men into a
*ell organized, shifty team, with
»orlds of speed and determination,

October IC, 1916, thus taking from
our club one of our most faithful
members, -from our community, an
honored woman and respected friend,
and from her family a loving wife
and mother.
When the Neighborly Neighbors meet
again
There will be one vacant chair;
Our loved and loyal president
Will not be with us there.
Our hearts will ache with sorrow
When we see the empty apace
Where so oft she gave us greeting
With a smile upon her face.
Our thoughts go out In sympathy
To the husband left alone,
To 'he- son and daughter now bereft
Of a mother In the home.
Sweet memories will come to us
That will cause our eyes to fill;
Although the parting's hard to bear
We know it is Cod's will.
May the Heavenly Father watch o'er
us,
And guide our wandering feet,
So when the final roll Is called
Our club will be complete.
