More important, so far at least as
values are concerned, than any public
auction ever held In Honolulu, 13. the
sale of mhat is known as the Mahuka
site at noon tomorrow. The govern
ment has set a minimum of 5200,000
for bids to be entertained, but there
3 no doubt that bidders are ready to
co well a.bove those figures.- Indivi
dual bidders mill be in attendance and
representatives of combinations or
Luis mill also be there. A represen

m hica the property mill bring run well
over that price, ranging generally be-tm-eea
$2:o.t!Ca and . $300,000.
Since the Star-Bulletin ' made th6
first announcement that tnd govern
ment had directed Collector Franklin
tb sell the premises once sought for
a federal building site. Interest tn the
sale has grown steadily. There have
teea rumors of huis formed for, the
purchase cf the land and for a divi
sion of the premises in case of suc
cessful bidding or of 'coaabinatlons to
buy it in and erect large buildings.
Some of these have been well authenti
cated. A report that was heard this morn
ing seems to have substantiation. It
Is to the effect that Castle & Cooke
and George Wilcox have formed a com
bination to secure the property. That
the firm manta property adjacent to
and in the rear of present holdings,
und that if the combination' secures
the property at ita figures, a large
