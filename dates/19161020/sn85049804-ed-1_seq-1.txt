HOWARD DREW NOW
IN DES MOINES
Howard Drew, the crack sprinter
who has smashed records on the cinder
path, has arrived in Des Moines and
enrelled at Drake university.
Drew reached the city Friday even
ing and conferred with Ralph Glaze,
football coach at Drake with whom he
was acquainted at the University .of
Southern California at Los Angeles.
Drew plans to attend school and do
some work on one of the local news
papers.
The crack Sprinter ia just recover
ing from a paralysis attack which pre
vented him from participating in recent
competitions. While in a race at San
Diego he suffered a strain of a nerve
in the back that caused paralysis for a
time. He has now reepvered, however
and a rest will enable him to regain
his former strength.
It is not probable that Drew will
attempt to do any running or engage
in any athletic work at Drake, at least
for some time. He took a five mile
walk with Glaze today to keep in con
dition.
He is undoubtedly the fastest runner
in the world and now holds the world's
Record.
JONES & SAMUELS MOVE.
Our popular undertakers, the firm

colored undertakers in our city and
merit the united support of all of the
colored people. Mr. Jones has been
in business for the past eight pr ten
years and a few months ago Mr. E.
R. Samuels entered with Mr. Jones.
Mr. Samuels is the business manager,
and from the way he is making
things go he is the right man in the
right place. We welcome Mr. Sam
uels into our City into business. He
came from Enterprise, Iowa.

DES MOINES, IOWA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 20, 1916.
Music was furnished by the Capital
City cornet band. After the meeting
about thirty of Mr. Simmons' personal
friends, with their wives, attended an
elegant banquet in his honor at the
"Palace Sweet" Cafe and enjoyed an
other address from the guest of honor,
which was more in the nature of a
heart to heart talk, in which he gave
them some wholesome advice along
the line of acquiring property, educa
tion and character.
VOTE THE REPUBLICAN TICKET.
Des Moines, Iowa, Oct. 20, 1916.
Before entering upon the 19J.6 cam
paign, let us carefully consider the re
lation which the Negroes sustain to
the republican party, which gives them
the greatest measure of justice and
renders the greatest service to the
country.
Pointing to President Wilson's rec
ord in the matter of race discrimina
tion. In his speech at Independence
hall, Philadelphia, July 4, 1914, when
he was a candidate for the presidency,
he gave assurances that he would not
discriminate against Negro citizens of
the United States.
Notwithstanding these assurances
of support of the principle of equality
before the law and in goyernmental
affairs, great discrimination has been
practiced, not only in the departments
over which the president has indirect
control, but also in appointments that
are made by himself.
Under republican administrations
the policy was pursued of appointing
a colored man to fill thevaacncy creat
ed by the resignation, death or expir
ation of term of a nun of that race.
This policy was reversed by the demo
cratic administration and the follow
ing colored persons have been succeed
ed by white men:
Wm. H. Lewis, assistant attorney
general, $5,000.
J. C. Napier, register of the treas
ury, $4,000.
Chas. W. Anderson, collector inter
nal revenue, New York, $4,500.
Henry W. Tyler, auditor for N. de
partment, $4,000.
C. F. Adams, assistant register of
treasury, $2,500,
Joseph E. Lee, collector of internal
revenue, Jacksonville, $4,500.
N. W. Alexander, register Jf the
land office, $2,500.
J. E. Bush, receiver public monies,
$2,500.
Chas. A. Cotteill, collector of in*
ternal revenue, Honolulu, $4,500.
T. V. McAllister, receiver of public
monies, Jackson, Miss., $2,500.
Robert Smalls, collector of port,
$1,500.
Jas. A. Cobb, special assistant attor
ney, Washington, $2,000.
Diplomatic and consular service:
Henry W. Furnise, envoy extraor
dinary and minister plenipotentiary at
Port au Prince, Hayti, $10,000.
Geo. H. Jackson, consul, Cognac,
France, $2,500.

Nicaragua, $3,000.

in Chicago.

For the above reason the 800,000
available Negro voters in the country,
excluding the disfranchised south,
should vote a straight republican
ticket to regain whatever has been
lost for the good of the country at
large.
We must acknowledge that we are
in a critical period, perhaps more
critical than any period since the civil
war.
We need a dominant sense of na
tional unity the exercise of our best
constructive powers. We desire that
the republican party as a great liberal
party shall be the agency of national
achievement, the organ o" the effective
expression of dominant Americanism.
Awake to obligation, erect in self
respect, prepared for every emer
gency, devoted to the ideals of peace
instinct wjth the spirit of human in
dividual opportunity and the public in
terest, maintaining a well ordered con
stitutional system adapted to local
self-government without the sacrifice
of essential national authority, appre
ciating the necessity of stability, ex
pert knowledge and thorough organiz
ation as the indispensable conditions
of security and progress.

BUXTON'S GREAT FIRE.
$20,000 Damage—All To Colored Peo
ple's Property—Coopertown Al
most Completely Destroyed.
On last Friday, October 6th, at
about 2 o'clock a. m. fire was discov
ered in one of Mrs. B. Cooper's
grocery stores, and as there was no
water supply nor no fire extinguishers,
the people were unable to stop the fire
until it had burned more than one-half
of the business houses in Coopertown.
The list of property destroyed is as
follows: The Buxton hotel, valued at
$10,000, owned by Reuben Gaines, Sr.,
with but little insurance the Cooper
drug store and stock, valued at $5,000
Mr. Anderson's (white) grocery store
building, owned by Mr. Cooper, store
and stock of goods valued at $5,000.
The next to go was the Masonic hall
and equipment valued at $1,000, partly
insured the Household of Ruth, the
Eastern Star lodge hall and the taber
nacle all destroyed, valued at $2,000
the Buxton cigar factory, owned by
Mr. Roberts, valued at $500 the
Grandberry tailor shop was the next
building, valued at about $300. Then
the flames swept on east, reaching
their amusement hall, which was
owned by Mrs. Cooper. The fire then
began to pursue its easterly direction,
burning several of the residences. It
was finally stopped. The insurance
was very small, as no company would
risk more than about one-sixth of the
value. The cause is unknown.
WILSON MUST BE SNOWED UN
DER.
Lqt us pass the word around to every
voter that Wilson must be snowed un
der at the polls next month. He has
been a disgrace to that high office. As
president he has lowered every high
ideal and the dignity of our country
is at a low ebb. He has done every
thing in his power to segregate, ostra
cise and destroy the hopes and aspira
tions of the Negro. He has turned out
our employes who were under the civil
service and replaced them by incom
petent office seeking democrats. He
is undoubtedly th«fw6rst man that has.
ever been elected president. He'cre
ates hatred among his own citizens
and then compels the U. S. soldiers
(colored) to ride throtigh Texas in jim
crow cars to go and protect the state
of Texas from Mexico. If we are good
enough to be asked to go to war then
in the name of God" treat us like other
soldiers. Let every colored voter vote
against Wilson.

regular Republican candidates
thp legislature from Polk county.
TWO NEW MAGAZINES.
Chicago seems to be fortunate for
new magazines. The Champion Maga
zine is published by Mr. Binga, the
banker. Its October number is indeed
a very fine number, illustrated with
many cuts, with some good strong edi
torials. It just meets my idea about a
magazine. The Chicago Mid-Western,
3708 Wabash avenue, is another new
magazine just out. It, too, is finely
-V^'V-.
illustrated by cuts, etc., with good
reading matter, well edited. Mrs. G.
C. Johnson of this city is agent for it.
We wish both of these worthy race
enterprises a good success!
Our next stop was Armstrong. This
is abeautiful little towa with a good
population of colored people. The
churches seemed to be alive. We went
to the residence of our uncle. From
here we started to find prospectus
students and got the promise of sev
eral students who were anxious to get
an industrial education. We observed
that nearly all the colored people
owned their own homes. Some were
doing nicely. We found in this town
two churches and two lodge halls. The
churches seemed to be in a spiritual
condition, being presided over by able
divines. Sunday afternoon we ad
dressed the Epworth League at the
M. E. church. Sunday evening we
preached to a large and appreciative
audienfre at the Baptist church. We
made a fctrbng appeal for Bartlett
school in ordeKjhat its colors might
float to the breeze!
Glasgow was oui? next. .TVe
made our way to the school nouse and
found the school in session, under the
leadership of Prof. Perkins. We here
addressed the' school, touching on in
dustrial education and encouraging
the young Negro to go to Bartlett and
get a good industrial educ&tion and be
able to enter any part of the commer
cial world.
We next set out to get prospectus
students and got the promise of sev
eral. Here we met Prof. A. R. Chinn,
who, after spending a number of years
in school work, has retired from the
business.
Slater was our next stop. At Slater
we found our old friend, Prof. Lewis,
teaching a good school and having
good success. We found two who
said they were interested in industrial
education and were coming over to our
school. We found Slater to be a good
little town fcir colored people. Sever
al colored men were employed in good
positions. Many owning good homes
and operating good businesses.
Our next stop was the Cow Creek
settlement. In this community we
found that the colored people owned
nearly all the land in the-district, that
all the school board was composed of
colored men, who managed all the
school business of the district. There
are three Negroes in this community
who have recently bought automo
biles Here we called the people to
gether in a mass meeting and made a
strong appeal for the Bartlett Agri
cultural and Industrial School, the
farm life school of the state now offer
ing the greatest advantages to the
Negro youth of any school of its kind
in the west, and got two students.
Our next stop was Marshall. We
found Marshall in a prosperous condi
tion. The Negroes are owning some
good property and are advancing rap
idly.

FOR
OBSERVATION ON A TRIP
BARTLETTS CHOOL.
We left Dalton September 7th. As
we reached Higbee a slow, steady rain
was falling. We stopped here. We
found the way to the colored school
and found our old friend, Prof. Green
Thompson, teaching school. He seemed
to have a very bright little school.
We next made arrangements for a
mass meeting at the Baptist church".
After securing a lodging place for the
time we were to remain in Higbee
we went back to the school house and
addressed the pupils. That day's
work, was done. The next morning
dawned brightly, the rain^ clouds had
rolled away, the sun shone down with
its beauty and splendor ind every
thing looked bright and prosperous to
man. We now set out to call upon
prospectus students for Bartlett school
at Dalton. We succeeded in interest
ing a few students, who promised to
be at our school on the opening day.
We observed several Negro homes in
this totfn, a little above the average
for towns of that size. In the evening
we addressed a large and appreciative
audience at the Baptist church. We
made strong appeals for industrial
education such as was being given at
the Bartlett school.

we found the school in session* If#
also obseryed that in this town tfca'
children were increasing instead of di
minishing, as we found in former
places. We set out to canvass the
town for students. We called upon
and got the promise of several who
were interested in industrial Hwa
tion and are going to Bartlett.
... Qur nextstop was Blackwater. HeiW
we found the Negro owning a better
grade of homes than they owned nine
yean ago. Here we preached to
large audience and created a fine In

we represent. i»1
Our. next stop was Boonville,
we found a fine modern and wlel

which when finished will be one of tibo
