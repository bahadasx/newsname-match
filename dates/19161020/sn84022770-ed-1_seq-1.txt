HUGHES' CAMPAIGN
IS SLUMPING FAST
WILSON'S POPULARITY GROW
ING RAPIDLY, REPUBLICANS
ARE GLOOMY.
Gloom Alls the headquarters of
the Republican national committee
from Chairman Willcox down, for
reports have como from the west
and middle west that the Hughes
campaign has been a failure and
that President 'Wilson's popularity
is growing in leaps and bounds.
Consequently the Republicans have
taken the management of the cam
paign out of the hands of the local
men and will run it from national
headquarters.
Roosevelt's failuro to stir up
Hughes sentiment has the Republi
can managers worried. Chairman
Willcox has received many requests
that he be taken off the stump while
from no place has there come a re
quest that he make a second speech.
The flat failure of his speech at
Wilkes-Rarre on Saturday, the Bth,
has proved disconcerting to the Re
publican managers who were play
ing their last card for the labor
vote.
WorklnictiiPii for Wilson.
To add to the gloom Fred O.
Greiner, Republican leader of Buf
falo, told Chairman Wilcox that the
workingmen are for President Wil
son's re-election almost unanimously
and that heroic treatment must be
appliod to save Mr. Hughes.
The hardest blow is the collapse
of the Republican candidate's metro
politan newspaper support. The
New York Tribune, which has a
long and unbroken record of Repub
licanism and which a few days ago
felt compelled to disagree pointedly
with Mr. Hughes' Lusltanla speech,
this week published a political fore
cast which amounts to a virtual con
fession of the defeat of the Republi
can candidate.
Hughes a Disappointment.
The forecast reports' to be based
upon confidential reports from every
doubtful state received by one of the
most prominent campaign managers.
It gives Hughes only 184 votes. In
cluding Ohio's 24 and West Vir
ginia's eight. The New York Eve
ning Post's story of the republican
campaigns slump follows its edito
rial declaration last Saturday that
Hughes has proved to be a disap
pointment. The Post, which set out
to be friendly to Hughes, Is through
with him.
An Interesting sidelight on the
dilemma of the Republican press
that is called upon to support a can
didate without an Issue la furnished
by the fact that the Philadelphia
Public Ledger's S2OOO prize contest
for the beat editorials In support of
each presidential candidate was won
lor the Wilson side by Ernest F.
Beddington of the editorial staff of
the Philadelphia North American,
which is half-heartedly supporting
Hughes.
The Ledger announced that 469
contestants urged President Wil
son's retention In office, while only
829 editorials were submitted in
favor of Mr. Hughes.
Men's Club Meet* Tuesday.
Members of the Men's Club of St.
John'a Episcopal church will hold
their first fall meeting at the church
next Tuesday night, October 24,
when the Rev. William H. Bliss, rec
tor of Trinity Episcopal church, Se
attle, will deliver the address. The
meeting will start with a dinner at
6:16, followed by a smoker, and any
man who cares to attend will be

Members of the Thurston county

with dogs, In violation of the law.
All of the game wardens are making
special efforts to stop this practice.

DYE FROM LHJNITE COAL.
McArthur Has Plan to Develop Hiu
William McArthur of the Hercu
els Sandstone company of Tenino,
who has been experimenting for sev
eral years with lignite coal, states
that It Is particularly rich In dye
stuffs and that he has found a simple
and cheap method of extracting the
crude base of the dyes from the coal
direct, not from coal tar.
The railroad recently built by the
stone company to its quarry up the
Skookumchuck river from Tenino
taps a rich field of lignite coal, which
has never been developed owing to
lack of capital. Mr. McArthur is
planning the formation of a corpora
tion with sufficient capital to develop
the scheme and says that, If neces
sary, he will endeavor to interest
Eastern capital.
M'INTOSH IN RACE
FOR COMMISSIONER
WELL KNOWN TTMWATER RES-
I DENT 18 CANDIDATE ON
DEMOCRATIC TICKET.
R. B. Mcintosh of Tumwater, who
was nominated on the Democratic
ticket for county commissioner in
the Second district, this week an
nounced he had decided to make the
race, after having been requested to
do so by friends In the city and all
parts of the county, and immediately
prepared to conduct an energetic
campaign.
Mr. Mcintosh is the only candidate
on the Democratic ticket in the coun
ty, and there is no candidate for this
office on the Non-Partisan ticket, so
that his only opponent is S. Y. Ben
nett, who was nominated on the Re
publican ticket. Mr. Mcintosh has a
ho<st of friends throughout the coun
ty, having lived here 33 years, and
is familiarly known by them as
"Bob." He is a resident of Tum
water and a member of its town
council.
•
Mr. Mcintosh came to Thurston
county in 188$. For the last 15
years he has been engaged in the
lumber and logging business and Is
acquainted ,with every part of the
county, have worked in all parts of
it. and has the reputation of being a
man who produces results. He knows
property valuations and is familiar
with road work, having had to con
struct roads in opening up different
timber tracts.
Mr. Mcintosh announces that he
will guarantee the taxpayers that If
elected commissioner he will see to
It that everybody employed by the
county earns the money he la paid—
that* there won't be any "loafing on
the Job," -so far as he has Jurisdic
tion. And in the conduct of the
county's affairs he will use the same
Judgment he always has In his pri
vate business and will conduct the
county bußlneas as if It were his own.
If elected, he will not permit poll
tics to Interfere with a fair and Just
administration of the duties of his
office and will endeavor to see that
each community in the county re
ceives an equitable and Just share of
all moneys that come" under his
supervision. He has made no pre
election promises and is free to per
fcim the duties of his office with
fairness and impartiality to all.
He believes that when money is
spent on roads, it should be spent in
such a manner that the resulting
work will be permanent, yet he does
not believe in going Into debt to
buNd roads. He also believes that
close attention should be given to
the work In the different road dis
tricts, so that the best results can be
obtained.

the purpose of perfecting their or

A lady speaker from the Seattle
league will address the meeting and
there will be a special program of

These leagues are being formed
all over the country by the women

All ladies of the city are invited,
whether they contemplate joining
the league or not, and are promised
an interesting program of exercises.
James E. Bradford, Progressive
nominee for governor, and Frank A.

WORD SKETCHES OF NON-PARTISAN CANDIDATES
Intimate Glimpses at Those Who Aspire to County Office on
Their Ability Alone, Who Are Making Their Campaigns on
Their Individual Merit, and Who Owe No Allegiance to Any
"Machine."
T. M. M'VEY
Noii-Partlsan Candidate for
SHERIFF
The sheriff's office will be active
In the Bervice of the people day and
night, the county jail will be closely
supervised, no easy freedom will be
granted prisoners and everything to
be given them will be carefully in
spected, says T. M. McVey, the Non-
Partisan candidate, if he is elected
sheriff.
McVey says he will also break an
other tradition of the office, that It
is not a detective agency, and will
actively lead the search for all
wrongdoers. He is, incidentally, a
"dry" candidate, and proposes to fer
ret out and atop bootlegging through
out the county, if he la elected. Prin
cipally, he proposes to be on the job
all the time, ready to attend to his
duties whenever he may be needed,
instead of "putting It off until to-'
morrow."
Since January 4 last McVey has
been a member of the Olympia police
force and the experience he has
gained In that positldn will stand
him In good stead If he is elected
sheriff. He is married, is a taxpayer,
and has made his home in Thurston
county during 16 of the 18 years In
which he has lived in the state.
McVey knows Thurston county
well, for be has worked in lumber
mills In nearly every part of It, as
mill foreman. For seven years he
worked at Union Mills, then he was
at Tenino two years, at Bordeaux an
other year and then at the Buchanan
mills in this city for two years. He
knows the county and the county
knows him.
And he knows, too, the kind of a
job he Is tackling, if he Is elected
sheriff. That 1B why he proposes to
be on the job all the time, to give his
personal supervision to the manage
ment of the county jail, to be active
in the suppression of crime and to
lead in the search for those who may
violate the laws.
j McVey doesn't propose to have any
maniacs "running amuck" on his
hands, he isn't going to make things
easy for a jail delivery. Fact is, he
is going to run the office so those
kinds of things won't happen, if at
tention to business can prevent them
| —and it usually can.
And. further than that, he is going

TO FORM FIRST FARM
LOAN CLOB IN STATE
| Local Farmers Called to Attend
Meeting at Courthouse
Saturday.
Thurston county farmers inter
ested in the formation of a farm loan
'club here under the provisions of the
rural credits law passed by the last
congress are called to meet at the
courthouse at 1 o'clock Saturday aft
ernoon. The proposed club will be
the first to be organized in this state.
Plans for its formation were dis
cussed in an informal way by about
a dozen farmers who attended the
regular October meeting of the
Thurston County Pomona Grange at
Chambers Prairie last Tuesday, when
it was decided to call the meeting in
this city for Saturday. Any number
of persons may become members.
Representatives of nine of the
subordinate Granges of the county
attended the Pomona meeting, when
two candidates were initiated. Po
mona Master L. L. Snow, as secre
tary of the Fair committee, made a
preliminary report, showing a small
deficit, and the Pomona authorized
the committee to pay the Grange's
half of this sum, the remainder to
be paid by the Chamber of Com
merce.
An interesting debate on the ques
tion, "Resolved, that co-operation
among the Granges is successful,"
was won by the affirmative, support
ed by L. L. Spow and F. A. Warner.
The negative was upheld by D. J.
Bigelow and Travis Ayer. >
The Pomona will hold its Novem
ber meeting at the McLane Grange
hall, when the principal business will
be the election of officers.
A. S. CATON
Non-Partisan Candidate for
REPRESENTATIVE
Reduction of interest on delln
Quent taxes from 15 to at least 10
per cent, establishment of a state
marketing system, big reductions in
state appropriations and hence in
taxes, reform of the primary laws to
permit th» blanket primary Bystem,
and the use of the state's idle mill
lons in permanent funds to clear the
logged-off lands of Western Wash
ington—these are the principal fea
tures of the platform upon which A.
S. Caton of this city is running on
the Non-Partisan ticket for election
as one of Thurston county's repre
sentatives in the next legislature.
Mr. Caton is a farmer and a city
man combined. Last March, when
the horticulturists of tbe state gath
ered here in convention, they visited
his fruit ranch on the Westside and
pronounced it the best fruit develop
ment in Western Washington. That
is what he started out to do eight
years ago—he proposed to demon
strate that the lands of Western
Washington can be made as product
ive as any of the irrigated lands east
of the mountains. He has just har
vested a crop of pedigreed blue bell
peas that produced S2OO per acre.
Mr. Caton came to Olympia 14
years ago. He has always been ac
tive in the development of the city
and county—there at least 100 fam
ilies here now who located here
through his efforts. And his work in
developing his fruit ranch during
the last eight years has put htm in
touch with the farmers and the farm
ers' viewpoitns. He knows what they
need and will try to get It for them.
He thinks the present penalty of
15 per cent interest on delinquent
taxes is a rank injustice to the poor
man, the struggling farmer, and a
piece of great favoritism for the rich
man. He points out that when that
rate was fixed, the banks of this sec
tion then loaned money at 12 per
cent interest; but now when money
is much cheaper, when loans can be
had at 7 and 8 per cent, he thinks
that penalty ought to be reduced to
at least 10 per cent.
And Mr. Caton also thinks the
state has gone mad spending money.
When Washington became a state 25
years ago, the per capita wealth was
$913, he points out; in 1915 it was
$648, a decrease of 36 2-3 per cent.
And the per capita tax at the time of
statehood was only $10.40 and last

ATTACK ON LISTER
ACTS AS BOOMERANG
EXPKNSES FOR MANSION OR
DERED BY COMMISSION,
NOT BY GOVERNOR
Democratic state house officials
are chortling over the desperate at
tempts being made by the Republi
can party to discredit Governor Lis
ter and to stem the tide which is
setting in all over the state sweep
ing the gov%rnor back into office.
In a letter made public Thursday
by C. L. Whitney of Walla Walla,
Governor Lister is charged with be
ing wasteful and extravagant with
the public funds, and Whitney bases
his charges upon data furnished him
by the state auditor, C. W. Clausen.
Whitney, using Clausen's data,
points out what he considers waste
fulness ard extravagance.
The Republicans, in their efforts
to discredit the governor, and this
fact is causing the chortles, inciden
tally missed the man they shot at
and hit one of the Republican state
officials seeking re-election, the state
auditor, and at the same time Ed
Meath, state treasurer. To increase
the amusement. State Auditor C. W.
Clausen furnished the ammunition
which is booming upon his luckless
head.
There is in the state what Is
known as the state building commis
sion, composed of the governor, the
auditor, C. W. Clausen, a candidate
for re-election, and the state treas
urer, Edward Meath.
Oommision has Charge
This state building commission, be
it kncwn, has charge of the gover
nor's mansion and the grounds sur
rounding the mansion.
Clausen furnished a man, named
C. L. Whitney, with what he thought
would be good campaign material to
use against Lister, and included in
a long list of what Clausen thought
would be damaging evidence ap
peared several items tohich, If Clau
sen conformed with the law, as state
auditor and approved, reflect upon
him. One of these, the largest in
actual money value, is that charged
for the construction of a garage at
the governor's mansion. The sum in
volved is $5729.80. Clausen notifies
Whitney that this is a sample of Lis
ter's extravagances, and would lead
'the public to believe that Governor
Lister took this money and went and
spent it.
As a matter of fact, and here is
where Clausen will have *to do the
explaining, the funds were spent by
the state building commission, upon
and at the motion of Treasurer
Meath, seconded by Clausen as a
member of the board. Clausen and
Meath authorized this expenditure,
Clausen playing the leading part in
the deal.
A careful examination of the other
items shown in Clausen's letter re
flect upon the state auditor In a sim
ilar manner. Furnishings and house
hold goods which went into the gov
ernor's mansion are purchased
through the state building commis
sion, or at least the commission is
supposed to know what state's prop
erties are being purchased with pub
lic funds, as it signs, audits and ap
proves all vouchers.
Clausen must Explain
Just how Clausen is going to ex
plain his connection with the expen
ditures for improvements at the
mansion, which he approved, is
something which is causing more or
less conjecture here today. If he
maintains the position that these ex
!penditures were not justified, the
j Democrats are asking him why he
! voted for them, and if he only voted
for them in an effort to make cam
paign thunder for the Republican
: party, going on record as squander
j ing public funds to make campaign
material, or, if justified, why is he

HOLDING MEETINGS IN
COI'NTY NIGHTLY.
With meetings being held in dif
ferent parts of the county by repre
sentatives of both sides practically
every evening, the Thurston county
political campaign started off with a
rush this week and for the next two
weeks the fight will be waged with
much activity and hurrah and many
meetings.
Monday night the Non-Partlaan
candidates held a rousing meeting
at Yelm, devoted entirely to the
county ticket, while the Republicans
had a big meeting in this city and a
smaller gathering at St. Martin's col
lege, Lacey, devoted principally to
the national and state campaign*.
Tuesday night the Non-Partisanß ad
dressed an interested meeting in the
town of Lacey, while the Republi
cans sent delegations to Yelm and
Bordeaux.
The Non-Partisans slipped up oa
their schedule Wednesday evening
and failed to hold a meeting, while
the Republicans held forth at Rock
ester. Thursday evening the Noar-
Partisans had an enthusiastic meet'
ing at Little Rock, and the Republi
cans contented themselves with *
meeting in this city for the women,
addressed, by Mrs. Ida Finney Mack
erille of San Francisco, representing
the National Women's Party.
Friday night the Non-Partisana
are scheduled for a meeting at Sur
geon Creek and Saturday night they
are to go to Bucoda. The Republi
cans will appear at Fir Tree Friday
night and at Tono Saturday night.
The Non-Partlsan candidates are
conducting their own meeting*,
while the Republicans Imported Tom
Flsk of Shelton for several addresses,
while their opening meeting of the
campaign, Monday night, was ad
dressed by T. B. Bruener of Aber
