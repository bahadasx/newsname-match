The Largest in Years.
The Democrats of Lexington
and Lafayette county are jubi
lent over the success of the
tent meeting held in Lexington
last Friday. There were people
here from all over the county
eager to hear the speakers of
national prominence tell of the
. wonderful record made by Presi
dent Wilson and the Democratic
majorities in the two branches
of the national legislature.
The speakers in the afternoon
were Senator Hoke Smith, of
Georgia, and Hon. W. P. Sachs.
Sen. Smith has had wide exper
ience in national affairs and is a
fine student of political history.
His speech was free from dema
gogism and wholly applicable to
, present conditions. It was a fine
' effort and left an impression
that will be felt at the polls in
November.
The crowd at the evening
meeting had the pleasure of
hearing that great old war
horse of Democracy, Hon. A. M,
Dockehr, and Hon. Wallace
Crossley, candidate for Lieuten
ant Governor.
The Wentworth Academy band
under the leadership of Capt. F,
A. Day, furnished the music for
both the afternoon and evening
meetings.

. The Todhunter Recital.
A large and appreciative au
dience representing the discrim
inating taste of our community
greeted Miss Elliot Todhunter in
Murrell Auditorium Monday
evening. It was the hrst ap-
arance of the gifted reader
since her return from Boston,
where she studied with Leland
Powers.
The offering of the evening
was Hobart's allegorical play en
titled "Experience," a work mak
ing the severest dramatic and
emotional requirements.
With unlimited technical fa
cility and interpretative art Miss
Todhunter portrayed the var
ious characters and presented
the succeeding episodes in a
vivid and fascinating manner.
The presentation was addition
ally intelligible in everything
that Delsarte could bestow ; and
was illumined by distinctive pose
and gesture, which became as it
were a leit motiv for each char
acter. The unusual and delight-
ul play which has had a phe
nomenal success in Eastern thea-
res is only a mirror of life, fa
miliar to each one of us and
readily applicable. And the im
personation of Miss Todhunter
includes such power, charm and
irresistable force that her audi
tors are not only entertained,
but they at once place them
selves in personal touch with
experience.

whose auspices the entertain
menc was given is to he con
gratulated upon its engagement ;
and every one., present will re
member the evening as a rare
privilege.
