REPUBLICAN
BAN
DUET OlMER"
Nearly 300 sat down to
fine spread at Hartford
Tuesday night.
SPEAKERS ALL AT THEIR BEST
Hamilton. Kelley and the ex-governor
of Kentucky held audience
until a late hour.
Last Tuesday was a "Red Letter"
day for republicanism in Van Buren
county, and the campaign in this
county certainly had a most auspici
ous opening. The first annual ban
quet of the newly organized republic
an club, was -held at Hartford in the
evening, and by seven o'clock nearly
three hundred sat down to the splen
did spread provided by the Methodist
ladies of the village in the town hall.
They came from all comers of the
county and it was a splendid audience.
The appointments were complete in
every detail and many compliments
were heard on the excellence of the
spread, and service rendered by the
ladies.
The literary and political feast was
of course the big part of the event,
and the music furnished by the Bloom
ingdale band, including several vocal
numbers was high class and the boys
were encored again and again.
After cigars had been lighted, EL
W. Broughton, president of the club
and chairman of the county committee
in well chosen language introduced
the toastmaster Representative Lynn
J. Lewis. Lynn made a somewha.
lengthy but a strong address, and in
troduced the speakers in a happy
manner. The Invocation was given
by Rev. T. Porter Bennett of Hartford
Congressman E. L. Hamilton was the
first speaker and as usual he was at
his best. It was the general impress
ion that Mr. Hamilton never made a
better political speech than the one
given on this occasion. He was fre
quently interrupted by applause, and
it was very evident that the distin
guished congressman from the fourth
district is just as near to the hearts
of his constituents as he has been
luring all the twenty years he has
been in Congress.
Hon. P. H. Kelley was next on the
program, and'Tats" speech was a
gem. Never was a more logical and
forceful argument on the political
issues of the day presented to any
audience. It is to be regretted that
every voter in Van Buren county, re
gardless of political affiliation could
not have heard it. To any one who
was "on the fence" or undecided as to
what was to their best interest pol
itically the argument was most con
vincing. Ex Governor Augustus E. Wilson
of Kentucky was the last speaker on
the program. The hour was late
when he was reached, and the distin
guished gentleman from Kentucky
made his remjirks rather brief, much
to the regret of his listeners . The
Governor was not the polished orator
of either the other speakers on the
program, but his remarks had the
"Punch" that carried conviction.
It was a great meeting and satis
factory to everybody. The writer re
grets that time and space will not per
mit a complete review of the splendid
addresses. They were all worthy
efforts and a genuine treat to those
present.
Two vocal solos rendered by Mr.
Bennett, son of Rev. Porter Bennett
added pleasure U the occasion.
First Meeting Of
Cotorie Wednesday
The first meeting of The Coterie
for the year comes next Wednesday
October 25th. It is hoped that all
members will be present and have a
voice in disposing of the important
business to be transacted. Mrs.
Clara Towers is chairman for the day
and the following program will bo
rendered:
Roll Call Current Events
Library Extension Mrs. Nellie
Purington.
Discussion
Along what lines can we best pursue
civic work?
Vhat do we know about Civil
Service?
BILL KILLFFEfi ENJOYING LIFE.
Bill Killefor LI certainly enjoying
life now after a strenuous season of
base ball. He is at Three Mile Lake
every day coaxing members of the
finny tribe to take the hook. Many
of his Paw Paw friends can testify to
Bill's skill as a piscatorial artist and
the fish taste fine too at this season
of the year. Bill is certainly looking
fine, and it is very evident that the
Loei of the pennant to his team, which
they came so near to landing, does
not cost him any loss of sleep. It is
all in the game and one of the for
tunes of base ball.
ORIGIN OF FIRE A
GOMPLETE MYSTERY
Fire destroyed the C. A. Sturtevant
barn and surrounding buildings Mon
day noon. The origin of the fire is a
mystery. It started in the tool house
adjoining the barn and the buildings
I including the granary, cow barn, to
gether with the machinery, tools and
icontents of barn were a complete loss.
I The buildings and extents were part
ially covered by insurance. Mr. Sturt

the following list of Van Buren county folks now living in California and who
Were present at the semi annual picnic of the Michigan society of Southern
California held at Sycamore Grove, Los Angeles, California on September 1G.
The picnics are looked forward to with great interest, and while the Michigan
people there like their Bunny California, they do not forget the old state of
Michigan. In a note at the bottom of the list, Mr. Sirrine says. "I can count
thirty-five more from Paw Paw who are now living in Southern California at
the present time who were not at the picnic. Making a total of sixty-six.
Quite a colony."

REPUBLICAN BANQUET NOTES
"Some Banquet" was the universal
verdict at 12:00 o'clock, and no one
seemed in a hurry to get away.
Paw Paw certainly furnished its
share of the crowd.
Senator's Tripp and Woodruff
occupied seats at the Speakers table.
Our old- friend George Merriman
was very much in evidence. George
is always on hand to see that every
thing is just right, and every bods
taken care of
The ladies received many compli
ments on the excellence of the spread.
The encore "Knock the 'L' out of
Kelley" sung by Oscar Bennett, caus
ed much merriment at "Pat" expense
Roy Hinckley would like to find the
man who wore off his perfectly new
green hat.
Any one who would not be convin
ced by Pat Keller's unanswerable
argument is limply past redemption.
We don't know who the soloist was
with the Bloomingdale band, but he
was some singer.
"Farmer" Clark and Dick Congdon
of Berrien COUnty were among the
banqueter.-.
Governor Wilson of Kentucky cer
tainly has the "Punch." "Too proud
to fight" has no place in his vocabul
ary. The hour was late but they
simply wouldn't let him quit.
WHO HAS ROY S 0 KT1
As a result of the banquet, at Hart
ford last TttCSdsy nighf, Roy Hinck-
ley, proprietor of the Hartford Hotel
is minus a perfectly good new hat.
Some one changed hats with Roy at
the hotel, and if any one is wearing :i
"Tiger Favorite" green in color and
size 7 that does not belong to the
wearer, Roy would be exceedingly
glad to hear f rom him.
ENTERTAINED HIE HELP
At the wind-up of the grape har
vest on Concord Ranch, Mrs. J. M.
Towers entertained the hfln with ice
cream and other refreshment .
Go to Laverty's for your Hallow
een masks, horns, jack'olanterns and
marshmallows. (adv)

SUNNY CALIFORNIA
Angeles, California Paw Paw
Los Angeles, California Paw Paw
Anyone who does not give the
Bloomingdale band credit for being
about the best bunch of musicians in
the country has another guess coming.
It beats all how some Paw Paw
people can eat. With a perfectly
elegant banquet coming at seven
o'clock several were seen at the
tables in the hotel at six o'clock.
Among them was noticed, Harvey
Sherman, Bangs Warner, W. G Fo
ley and Judge Des Voignes, and they
all ate at the banquet just as thoug'i
nothing had happened.
Neat programs and menu cards
from the Day Spring Presses were
placed beside each plate.
In one of his climaxes, toastmaster
Lewis forgot where he was and ad
dressed the "Gentlemen of the Jury."
It caused some laugh at Lynn's ex
pense, but he was not so far out of
the way at that.
Congressman Hamilton looks
younger has more vigor and makes a
better speech than he has for years,
and that is going some.
The "lied Fire" which the boys
burned on the way from the hotel to
the hall, reminded us of the old time
campaign.-.
President Broughton, attributed Mr.
Bryan's proclivities for Grape Juice
to his visit to Paw Paw some year
ago on thoChautauqua circuit.
VERN THANKS THE PUBLIC
1 take this opportunity to thank all
of the Idle Hour patrons for their
patronage and support during the
past two years. I also wish to an
nounce that the Idle Hour is now
under new management, and will be
conducted far better in the future
than it has been in the past. It gives
me pleasure to say to my friends that
Ray C. Wilson, formerly with Long
well Bros, is the new manager. I
know that he is worthy of your sup
port and that he will give the Idle
Hour patrons the best there is to be
had in pictures. I bespeak for him
your hearty co-operation and support.
Again I thank you.
Vernon C. Decker
Mr. and Mrs. D. R. Thayer were call
ing on Allegan friends last Sunday.
SUNDAY SCHOOL CONVENTION
The Van Buren County Sunday
School convention will be held in the
Baptist church at Bloomingdale on
Thursday and Friday October 26 and
27th. A most interesting program

session. Rev. E. Wr. Smith of Paw
Paw has a part on the program of
Thursday and Rev. F. A. Shape of the
'Christian church is on for Friday.
On Friday evening Grant M. Hudson
will deliver his address "Dry Michi
gan" which should be heard by every
! citizen in the county who can possibly
'get there.
LONG BOYS SUFFER
HEAVY FIRE LOSS
Heniy and Lewis Long suffered a
heavy loss by fire last Saturday after
noon. They were threshing buck
wheat at the Lew Woodman barn
across the road from their place in
Waverly township. Suddenly the
j whole place was in flames. Caught
I either from some one's pipe or a
! spark from the engine It
spread and burned so quickly that
nothing but the horses could be saved,
and the fruits of their summers work,
; which included hay, oats, ctraw, buck
j wheat, tools, cutter, sleighs, hen
house and twenty cords of wood, went
up in smoke. The separator belong
ing to Newell Hobbs, and a new one
also burned. The buildings and con
tents were covered by only a small
insurance.

HIS OLD TRICKS
Putting a little "Pep" in
the republicans of Kala
mazoo County.
Charles Wcidenfellow, formerly of
: Bloomingdale this county is now a
citizen of our neighboring count y of
jKalamazoo. Judging from his pres
'ent activitv in that citv, "Weid" is
proving just as "Live a Wire" there
as he was when a resident of Van
Burn county. Following is what the
Kalamazoo Advocate has to say of
him in a recent issue.
The Republican party, who seeming
ly has been in a sort of comatose con
dition for a number of years, as a re
sult of its 1,000 majority threatens to
come out of the shell this year and
actually do some work toward the
election of the national ticket instead
of each member tossing off the all
important duty to some other member
with the result that little, if any, work
has actually been performed.
The reason that this may be
brought about is Charles Weiden
! fellow, a live wire of high voltage,
who but recently moved to Kalamazoo
but who possesses the ability of get
ting the members to dig in and work.
Mr. W'eidenfeilow possessei more
genuine "pep" to the square inch than
any Kalamazoo citizen and not alone
that, but he is able to instill that same
hustling spirit in others. He add- M
per cent to the Republican part) of
Kalamazoo county at the present time
! Back in the early W it was Chas.
W'eidenfeilow who organized the Chi
cago team of the brotherhood league.
The first plaver he hired under con
tract at that time was his present
good friend, Chas. Comiskoy, now
Owner of the White Sox. Single
handed and almost alone, Mr. Wciden
fellow conducted the affairs of the
Brotherhood. His ability as an organ
izer was acknowledged throughout the
country. At one time he was finan
cially interested in three teams.
Later Mr. Wcidenfellow went to
New York, where he engaged in busi
ness for a mumber of years. He was
always deeply interested in politic?
both in Chicago and the eastern
metropolis.
Twenty years ago he purchased a
home in Bloomingdale and decided to
retire and take things easy. But he
jwas too much of a live wire. He was
jSoon engaged in putting that village
on the map. Then he was elected to
the legislature. Right away he was
acknowledged to be one of the hust
ling members of that body. Last fall
he moved to Kalamazoo, actuated by
a desire to live the "simple life."

The important work of the session
in addition to the ordinary routine
was the consideration of County Road
appropriations. The road commiss
ioners made recommendations calling
for a three mill tax, which is the
maximum tax under the law. The
board cut this recommendation to two
mills to be spread on the assessed
valuation of each township. The
work will be distributed over the
county, instead of on one trunk line as
had been advocated. Following are
the roads to be taken over as county
roads, and the appropriations which
the commissioners recommended. This
is based on the recommendation of a
three mill tax. The actual amount
to be raised and expended therefore
will be just one third less than these
figures:
Lawrence and Hartford road $8,000
Kendall and Gobleville road 4,000
Gobleville &, Bloomingdale road 4,000
Grand Junction & So. Haven rd. 6,000
