TUESDAY NIGHT
Kekuku's Hawaiian Singers
Will Entertain
The Kekuku's Hawaiian Quintet
will be in Kendrick next Tuesday
night. This is the first number of
the Lyceum course and promises to
be one of the very best musical
numbers ever heard in Kendrick.
Last year the lecture course was
a decided success and was highly
spoken of by everyone who attend
ed. This year the Kendrick Cham
ber of Commerce has signed up for
an even better course consisting of
five numbers. The entertainments
are for your benefit and your sup
port should be extended in every
way possible to make the entertain
ments a success from every stand
point. There is no other way for a
small town to get a first class series
of entertainments than by signing
up for a lyceum course and the
only way to make possible a contin
uation of these entertainments is to
make them a success financially.
The Kekuku's Hawaiian Quintet
is composed of male voices, trained
to a very high degree. The music
which they produce has an inde
scribable charm and a sweet fasci
nation that the whole world is striv
ing, but without success, to emu
late. No American stringed instru
ment artist can imitate that pecu
liar subtlety of expression so easy
to the Hawaiian on both native and
international instruments. Keku
ku's Hawaiian Quintet, coming to
lyceum, are the foremost interpre
ters of that wonderful mnsic of the
South Seas Islands. The rrifembers
are drawn from the famous Toots
Paka, Alisky, and original Bird of
Paradise Companies. It is a brilli
ant ensemble of harp guitar,
ukulele and taropatch playeis,
featuring Joseph Kekuku, origina
tor of the celebrated steel method
of guitar playing. Mr. Kekuku is
conceded to be the world's greatest
solo guitarist. He is the genius of
that seductive slurring of the notes
as they softly swirl like an incense
from the strings. Even after the
notes have departed from the in
strument with the taste and deli
cacy of a sweet thought, they form
an echo chorus that seems to sing
the racial poetry of the Hawaiians
—a people whose very language is
a song.
Hear them play and sing: "Like
a Like" (Sweet Constancy), Waixi
ki (The Leaping Waters), Mai poi
na oe ia'u (Forget me not), Wali
lana (Drowsy Waters), Sweet Lei
Lehua (The Fragrance of the Lehua
Wreath), My Old Kentucky Home,
and many more of our most beloved
v^Tne ballads, and last, the mosten
nting of all farewell love songs
'"Aloha oe."
D. W. Davis Speaks
D. W, Davis, candidate on the
republican ticket for governor of
Idaho, spoke to a good sized crowd
on Main street here last Saturday.
He talked on state and national
issues and explained the policy
which he would expect to pursue in
the event of his election.
One of the strongest planks in
his platform is his idea of handling
the trust funds arising from the
sale of state land. He believes
that under his system it would be
possible in a short time to eliminate
all taxes for school purposes and in
time do away with state taxes for
all purposes.
Dr. Ward VanWort, a veterinary
surgeon who has been practicing at
Grangeville for a number of years,
has located in Kendrick and opened
offices at the Kendrick Livery ham.

Commissioners Exonerated
Boise, Idaho, Oct. 18.—The com
missioners of Latah county were
not in contempt of court in the
matter of authorizing a road levy,
and are exonerated from wrongdo
ing. This is the finding of the Su
preme court decision handed down
here tonight written by Chief Jus
tice Isaac N. Sullivan and concur
red in by Justice Alfred Budge.
The court finds that the commis
sioners misunderstood the terms of
the peremptory writ issued out of
the supreme court and while they
ignored it they did not do so know
ingly.
The Potlatch Lumber company,
through E. C. Boom, instituted pro
ceedings against the commissioners.
It wm okrimed that a sufficient gen
eral road tax levy had been made
by the commissioners and it was
not necessary for them to authorize
special levies. Boom applied for
and secured an order from the su
preme court citing the commission
ers to appear before the supreme
tribunal of this state and show
cause why they should not be re
strained from proceeding with the
authorizing of special district levies.
Death of Mrs. Mina French
Mrs. Mina Fischer French, who
has made her home in Kendrick for
a number of years, died at a Mos
cow hospital from tumor of the
pancreas. She had been ill for
som3 months and for the last three
or four weeks her life was held by
a slender thread.
Mrs. French was born near Pine
Citv, New York, on November 28,
1847, and was the daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Martin Fischer. She
married Charles A. French in Feb
ruary, 1867 and to this union nine
children were born, of whom seven
survive her, Dr. Harley E. French
of Grand Forks, North Dakota,
Burton L. French of Moscow, Mrs.
Lulu English of LaCrosse, Washing
ton, C. H. French of Boise, Frank
V. French of Athol, Mrs. Clara
McMinimy of Ilo, and Mrs. Mary
Ruberg of Clarkston, Washington.
She was a devout Christian and a
member of the Adventist faith, a
woman of the pioneer type who,
with her family lived on the fron
tier for nearly forty years in Indi
ana, Nebraska, Washington and
Idaho. Idaho became her home in
1882.
She was buried in the Moscow
cemetery by the side of her hus
band who was interred nine years
ago. The funeral was conduct
ed by Elder J. M. Moore of near
Kendrick, a member of the Adven
tist church, Saturday at 11:00
o'clock.

MEST UNITED
SHIES OFFICERS
Hanson and Minnis Charged
With Assault
As a result of the shooting of
Fred Stevens at Lapwai last Friday
night, and on complaint of "Red"
Pruitt, a friend of the wounded
man, warrants were issued by Just
ice Palmer McIntyre for Special
United States officers Hanson and
Minnis who were taken in custody
just as they were preparing to leave
town on the westbound train Sun
day evening. The officers were
placed in the county jail and the
charge is assault wiih intent to
commit murder, which will be
changed to a charge of murder in
case of the death of Stevens.
Stevens, it is alleged, was shot
while about to investigate in behalf
of his brother, Louis Stevens, a
cripple, who was being arrested as
a bootlegging suspect. Officer Han
son fired the bullet which entered
the body of Stevens.
The condition of Stevens grows
worse. The bullet has been located
embedded in the muscle just over
the right kidney, near the spinal
column, having passed thru the
body, penetrating the right lung.
A severe case of pneumonia has de
veloped, and owing to the lacera
tion of the lung, the attending
physician gives little hope of re
covery.
Friends of Stevens who witnessed
the shooting allege that Stevens
was emerging from the dance hall
with his wife when he was appealed
to by his brother, who was in the
hands of the officers, and that he
was shot before he came within 30
feet of the officers.
The officers assert that they were
acting in self defense when Stevens
was shot, as he was making an
assault on them after they had
placed George Weeks and Louis
Stevens under arrest.
At the arraignment of George
Weeks, which occurred before Uni
ted States Commissioner Eugene
O'Neill, Weeks was charged with
the introduction of intoxicating
liquor on the reservation. The
commissioner fixed his bond for
appearance at $10,000, stating that
he also took into consideration the
facts that W'eeks was possibly guil
ty of inciting a conspiracy to have
the officers mobbed, practically re
sulting in a riot occurring after the
shooting.
An injury, resulting from a fall
Sunday, made it necessary for
Gwendolyn Moser to be taken to a
hospital at Moscow Wednesday.
Her mother accompanied her to
Moscow.
AS SEEN BY
Conditions in Nebraska and
South Dakota
Editor Gazette—We returned in
due time from our run into South
Dakota. There is no doubt about
the energy and progressiveness of
this thriving commonwealth. A
wonderful change has been wrought
within the last fifteen years. In
every line of industry except farm
ing there has been a marked im
provement, but in this state as
everywhere, the rich they ride in
Cadillacs, the poor they ride in
Fords—and the latter, of course,
greatly outnumber the former.
These letters were started with a
view of giving candid expressions
concerning all matters coming un
der the direct observation of the
writer and now that we have finish
ed our travels in both Nebraska and
South Dakota we are ready to affirm
that the farming communities have
grown exceedingly reckless. On
every hand slovenliness seems the
order of the day. The buildings
unpainted, the yards and gardens
unkempt and orchards in a dilapi
dated condition. Hay stacks seem
to have been hastily thrown togeth
er and instead of the grain stacks
being rounded out like tops, they are
formed making the most profound
obeisame one to another. The
cornfields, as they are remembered,
were formerly kept clean of weeds
and most carefully cultivated, now
weeds predominate and a clean
cornfield is a rare exception. The
buildings and fences are demoral
ized. The only improvement not
iceable is found in the wagon roads
—or rather the auto roads.
We have tried hard to determine
the cause of this seeming careless
ness. In Wyoming it was thought
that the wind had denuded the
buildings of their first coat of paint
but later it was concluded that it
was the fault of the automobile or
the use of lubricants in the place of
linseed oil. The automobile should
be a blessing to the farmer but in
the present day it is sadly over
worked to the detriment of shirk
ing needed work and repairs on the
farm. Whether the farmer shall
be greatly benefited by this modern
improvement depends on his ability
to conserve its use instead of dissi
pating it.
Little opportunity was afforded
for political investigations in this
state. Few people were met but
the son of an old soldier whom we
had formally known as a republican
was an ardent supporter of W'ilson.
It was the opinion expressed by a
number of simple minded folk that
Hughes was losing ground as the

Land Agent W. E. Daggett and of
the 1,000 acres offered for sale, 840
acres were sold at prices ranging
from $10 to $165 per acre. The
top price was paid for 40 acres lo
cated 5 miles north of Avon and
the general belief that the land con
tains a valuable deposit of mica,
resulted in spirited bidding when
the tract was offered for sale. The
land sold lies adjacent to the towns

campaigne progressed.
Sioux City was noted for its hum
of industry. All lines of endeavor
seemed running at full capacity.
We can find little else in its favor.
We closed our eyes in this Indian
City of Iowa and opened them in
Freeport, Illinois our next stopping
place. Here we had a greater op
portunity for studying political af
fairs. A long acquaintance with
the editor, and the business mana
ger of a daily newspaper afforded
! us easy access to inside information.
The paper in question has preach
ed Jeffersonian doctrines for a gen
, eration and now, as might be ex
pected, was all for Wilson. It
might be well to say that Freeport
is a city of 25,000 people and is a
typical German city. Its citv gov
ernment has been democratic for
many years but it is now run on a
reform campaign by republicans.
, The editor, above alluded to, has
( always been optimistic but he is
now in a doubting mood. All this
is occasioned by the hyphenated
voter or German-American. He
believes that Germany can dictate
the election of our next president.
He believes that Roosevelt's antag
onism to the voter with a hyphen
is but a cloak to throw aside sus
picion, and that there is a secret
compact with the leaders of Ger
man-American thought to deliver
this vote bodily to Hughes. How
much there is in this we leave to
the reader to judge. We give it as
the private opinion of a candid man
of wide experience. We met a few
Germans who are blazing a new
trail and are supporting the social
ist ticket. In Freeport there seems
to be lacking that political enthusi
asm found elsèwhere. A dearth of
working men %vas evidenced by the
large number of placards calling
for help on large public improve
ments. But here we pause. We
confidently expect to wake up in
the very near futuie in Chicago.

HE CLEAN BEINS
6ETJE MARKET
Poor Harvest Methods Used
in the Potlatch
One of the most serious difficul
ties with which the bean buyers
in Kendrick have to contend is the
poor condition in which the beans
are brought to market by the farm
ers. No one but the farmers them
selves can be blamed for this and
it is the farmer who will eventu
ally suffer. The remedy is a sim
ple one—more careful methods of
harvesting.
During an interview with one of
the Kendrick bean buyers we learn
ed the reason why the Idaho bean
has not advanced on the market as
much as it justly deserves. The
reason is simply this—they are too
dirty. After they are cut they are
raked together in windrows and
thrown on piles with a fork, with
out regard to the fact that there
are probably a hat full of clods
mixed in with every bunch of
beans. When the bunches are
thrown into the wagon the clods go
in with the beans and of course are
run thru the threshing machine
with the beans and into the sacks.
The buyers have two prices. One
is for cleaned beans and the other
for beans "in the dirt." The ma
jority of farmers sell their beans
"in the dirt" as they do not wish to
wait to have them cleaned. As
long as they are selling them "in
the dirt" they are not very particu
lar how much dirt gets into the
sacks and the result is a heavy
dockage. A farmer brought in 101
sacks of beans last week and out of
that lot 2600 pounds of dirt was
taken, after they were put thru the
cleaner.
Now this is the point. After the
beans are put thru the cleaner two
and even as high as three times,
there is a fine dust that collects on
them and gives them a dingy ap
pearance. The quality of the beans
is there but their appearance ser
iously injures their market value.
The Potlatch country has to com
pete with California, Michigan and
other bean raising sections of the
United States, and she can easily do
so from the standpoint of quality,
if the bean raisers will only take
the proper pains with their harvest
operations. The buyers here have
received numerous letters from the
eastern firms protesting against the
condition of the beans and insisting
that the dirt be taken out before
they are shipped. They praise the
quality of the product highly and
would class them with the best on
the market if it were not for their
dirty condition.
The Kendrick buyers are doing
everything in their power to get a
good market and the highest prices
possible for the producers. It is
simply up to the farmers to back
them up by getting their beans in a
first class, marketable condition so
that when they are put on the mar
ket they will compare favorably, in
every respect to the beans raised in
any other parts of the United
States.
Another Bean Story
Wallace Reid of Big Bear ridge
raised a fine crop of beans this year
on a 21-acre field. He harvested
189 sacks from the 21 acres, making
an average of 9 sacks to the acre
for which he received $6.10 per
hundred pounds. The total amount
received for the crop was $1680, or
an average of $80 per acre. Two
years ago Mr. Reid bought the land
for $70 an acre, so this years crop
will clear almost enough to pay for
the land.
