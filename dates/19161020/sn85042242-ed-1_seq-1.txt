Grand Rapids, Mich., Oct.
Patt Debate.
"Now, I propose, that we be prepar­
ed for the competition of a new Eur­
ope. It is perfectly idle to say that we
will debate against the great ques­
tions of free trade and protective tar­
iffs. We are past the time of debate
over any matters of theory. We are
face to fact with a condition of fact,
we are goipg to have a keener compe­
tition for American markets than ever
before. War factors abroad are easily
converted and have been erected so
as to lie converted in to peace factors.
Disciplined Europe is going to supply
goods for this market to the extent
of its ability.
Serious Depression.
"Our opponents, instead of having
any right to take political capital
from our present condition ought to be
assured by the memories of the Amer­
ican public that it *is both their policy
which they introduced through the
Underwood bill, that we were in a
state of serious depression before the
outbreak of the European war.
'If you would know what would take
place after the war ends consider the
condition before the war began."
American Agriculture.
"Now, I propose that we have an
American policy applied. I will not
call it a Republican polity. It is Just
as important for Democrats as it is
for Republicans. It is the American
policy, as Henry Clay quoted. The
"American Policy of Protecting Amer­
ican Agriculture." (Applause).
"It is no answer when we ad­
vance plain propositions relating to
policy essential for our upbuilding, to
say that we stand sponsers for in
visible government.
Against Invisible Government.
"I never was a sponser for invisible
government. I began my political
life fighting invisible government.
There was no invisible government
when I was made governor of Xew
York and there will be no invisible
government if I am president of the
United States. (Applause).
"We desire to have the economic
problem met fairly and candidly our
opponents have never believed in a
protective tariff. They denounced it
four years ago as unconstitutional.
They say now in their platform that
the Underwood bill embodies the tar­
iff which they think should be regard­
ed as embodying their policies. We
have an illustration then, of what they
propose. If they do stand for the
principles of tariff for revenue only, if
they do not stand for the principle
embodied in the Underwood bill, then,
as far as the tariff is concerned, they
stand without any principle whatever.
(Applause).
Favor Commission.
"They say that they favor a tariff
commission. I am glad of it. We favor
a tariff commission. We favored a tar­
iff commission when they were oppos
ed to it. We favored a tariff commis­
sion when they destroyed. They now
favor a tariff commission apparently
in the anxiety to get away from the
inconvenience of discussing the prin-

19.—Mr.
Hughes in speaking at Grand Rapids
Wednesday dwelt at length on the
need for a protective tariff. He said:
"We are not in a sound condition.
We are under a very unhealthy stimu­
lus. We have a demand created by
the struggle on the other side of the
water. We are in a condition of labor
plentifully employed, because of an
abnormal demand by a world at war,
for the products of labor In America.
It is a very unsound condition for this
country to be in, when it depends so
largely for its prosperity on the con­
tinuance of a European war.
Mutt Prepare.
"We must have regard to policies
which will prepare us for the inevit­
able day when that war shall end. We
must have policies which will make us
ready for the activities which will
be resumed by every one of .the bellig­
erent nations with an added discipline
and improved method of organization
and an increased efficiency. It is not
satisfactory at all to consider that at
this time a great percentage of Amer­
ican laboi* is devoted to supplying
product which will not be in demand
when Europe is once able to supply
them for herself. It is not a satis­
factory condition to think that we
shortly will have a reduced purchas­
ing power in this country. You for­
get that the demand for labor, the de­
mand for our products, created a pur­
chasing power of an abnormal char­
acter which is felt by American enter­
prise and trade throughout the coun­
try. And when the demand which is
the source of the temporary (feeJhflg^
of prosperity and ease is at an end,
then we shall be reduced to the neces­
sities which peace provides, and there
will be cessation of that stimulus up­
on which our present trade depends.

The only rear platform speech of

"Anything You Can Get By With
—I Have No Stool-Pigeons,"
Said to Be Instructions •...
Chicago, Oct. 19.—The direct charge
of having given police captains two
sets of instructions for dealing with
the vice situation was made against
Chief of Police Healey today. One or­
der, the accusation said, was in writ­
ing, and was for the benefit of the pub­
lic. It was that the law must be strict­
ly and rigidly enforced. The other
was in confidence and given orally
and was construed to.mean the district
commanders should wink at violations
and make as few arrests as possible.
"Anything you can get by with. I
have no stool-pigeons out," the chief
was said to have told the men.
The accusations were made by W.
P. O'Brien, suspended police captain,
in the hearing on the application ot
State's Attorney Hoyno for warrants
for Chief Healey and his secretary,
William Luthardt.
Counsel for Chief Healey sought to
bring out that the order not to make
arrests for Sunday closing violations
was the result of the state's attorney
failing to prosecute. Chief Justice Ol­
son, who is conducting the hearing,
ruled that the question was irrelevant.
"Inasmuch as the state's attorney is
trying to impeach the chief, it is only
right that it should be shown that the
state's attorney also failed to do his
duty—if that be true. If the chief
should see the uselessness of arresting
men if the slate's attorney .would re­
fuse to prosecute the. effect would be
reflected oil the department."

IT
Try
to
Get "Hooked Up"
MAN HELD IN JAIL, BUT
GIRL CANNOT BE FOUND
Jamestown, N. D., Oct. 1ft Tf two
village officers in the town of Medina,
a short distance west of here, after
making the arrests of an eloping cou­
ple, had not stoppea to debate the
matter out which should get the credit
for the deed, there might be two
young people in the Kidder county
jail today.
Instead F. Chance, an engineman at
Tappen, X. D., who eloped with Miss
Mary Riddle, the 16-year-old daughter
of Fred Riddle, prosperous Kidder
county farmer, is in the Kidder county
jail at Steele, while his bird mate has
flown, officers of Stutsman and Kidder
counties know not where. He refuses
to disclose her whereabouts.
It was a rather spectacular wedding
"march" that the couple took in order
to plight their love. They stole daddy's
automobile, but the darn thing ran
out of gas as they tore into the little
village of Medina. There two officers,
who had'wind of the elopement, made
the arrests. The couple was taken to
a home in that town. While the vil­
lage officers reasoned the matter out
as to who should get the credit, the
couple jumped through a window and
caught an east-bound freight.
Love got its second bad jolt when
the couple was ordered off the train
at Cleveland—in fact they were kick­
ed off. But there's more than one
train on the main line of the Northern
Pacific in a day. They waited! Offi­
cers of the county also waited. A
freight hovered in sight, they jumped
it. Chance came to Jamestow:
Where his mate went—why, that's
what the officers here and of Kidder
county and the father of the girl want
to know. Oh, no, Chance "will never
tell." Belief, however, is held by the
officers that the girl is in the Twin
Cities, cooing for her mate.
Sheriff F. A. Price of Kidder county
came to .lamestown last evening afler
the male member had been arrested.
He took his prisoner this morning to
Steele for committment in the jail
there.
It is reported that the two officers
of Medina scanned the skies for the
elopers -.vhen they got word of the af­
fair—but the conple surprised them
and came by machine.
In the warrant which was sworn la:
the arrest of Chance he is charged
with grand larceny not in connection
with the theft of the wealthy farmer's
daughter, but in the theft of the auto.
OIL COMPANY STRIKERS
WILL RETURN TO WORK
Bavonne. X. J.. Oct. 19.—Strikins
employes of the Standard Oil company
and of several other companies oper­
ating plants here, at a mass meeting
tonight voted to return to work to­
morrow. Earlier in the day John J.
Moffitt and James A. Smyth, Tnited
States mediators, had assured a com­
mittee representing the men that the
companies had expressed a willing­
ness to negotiate demands for in­
creased wages and better working
conditions if the workers would return
to their places.
The strike, which began ten days
ago, was marked by rioting, during
which three persons were killed and
many wounded.
As yet, no decisive result has been
achieved by either the Austro-Ger
mans or the Russians in the violent
fighting that has been going on for
several days in Volhynia and Oalicia.
South of Seborow, in Oalicia, several
enterprises have been carried out suc­
cessfully by the Austrians, while at
other points Russian attacks were put
down.
Having held the Teutonic Allies in
the mountain passes on the Transyl
vania-Roumania border for several
days, the Roumanians have taken the
offensive at various points, and now
are declared to be pushing back their
adversaries, who are leaving prison*
ers and guns in the hands of the
Roumanians. Berlin, however con­
troverts this statement by the asser­
tion that the Austro-Germans are en­
gaged in successful fighting in the
mountain passes.

lishing of a wholesale grocer house In

It was pointed out by Manager C. A
