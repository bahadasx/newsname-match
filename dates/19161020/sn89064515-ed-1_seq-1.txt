Tiring up the electric light franchise ex
tension ordinance and give»it its first
reading. It could then be brought up at
future meetings for discussion, he said.
Alderman Falk moved that the matter
l»e left until a meeting after the rate re
ports have been published anu thorough
ly discussed. Mr. Gordon did not take
kindly to this plan, saying that the or
dinance came before the council three or
four months ago and had since been pub
lished in both local papers, and had had
practically all the publishing that was
necessary and had also been discussed
ciuite thoroughly. He said that If the
council was going to turn down ae or
dinance, the sooner they do it, the bet

where they are at. However the Falk
motion was seconded and carried and
nothing'was done with the ordinance.

LIGHT COMMITTEE'S MAJORITY AND
MINORITY REPORTS HELP FOR
EXAMINATION
At a Meeting of the city council 'on
Wednesday evening two reports were
presented by the citizens* committee on
electric light rates, one a majority report
and the other a minority report, the lat
ter by Peter J. Vasaly The rate.com
mittee was recently appointed' by the
city council to make an investigation ojt
tiie rates and to submit to: that bOdy
sfchedulfe #ith the drop^~cha'r'ge! eliminat
ed. 'V Complaints that- the drop charge
was unfair w6re general and these com
plaints prompted: the council to take the.
above mentioned action.
At the first meeting of the rate com
mittee T. C. Gordon, manager of the
Water Power company, was asked to
submit a schedule of rates' satisfactory
to the company, but with the drop chargje
eliminated, as a basis to work frorn
This he did. After severalf meetings the
committee came to the conclusion- that
the schedule of rates subrriitted w£re un
satisfactory and at a later meeting he
submitted the figures whieh he 'would
accept, which are included in the sched
ule printed below, ana which are iitgher
than the schedule the committee had
agreed on at a previous meeting. Sev
eral meetings were held by the commit
tee and a report was finally agreedUpon
by a majority of the committee as given
below. The report was presented to tne
Council Wednesday evening and was
read by City Clerk Scliaflern, and the
minority report by Mr. Vasaly was also
read. Both reports follow: .:
City Council, Little Falls, Minn.
Gentlemen: The Citizens' committee
appointed by your body some time ago
to investigate the question of electric
light rates in Little Falls beg leave to
submit the following report embodying
the result of its' investigations and^ con
taining schedules oi proposed rates.
Residence Lighting and Current for
Cooking—Meter Rates
1st 20 kilowatt hrs.—Sc per kw-hr. pr. mo.
2d 20 kilowatt hrs.—6c per kw-hr. pr. ma
Balance —2c per kw-hr. pr. mo.
Minimum monthly bill $1.00 per meter
installed. Discount 5 per cent.
2. Commercial Lighting—Meter Rates
1st 100 kw-lirs.—8c per kw-hr. per mo,
2d 100 kw-hrs.—6c per kw-hr. per mo.
Balance —4c per kwrhr. per mo.
Minimum monthly bill $1.00 per meter
installed. Discount 10 per cent.
The manager of the Little Falls Water
Power Co. has approved the above sched
ules.
It will be noticed that the flat charge
for drops has been eliminated.
As heretofore.reported to this body the
proposed .rates are hot based upon a
scientific investigation of the company's
property or assets but is a comparative
rate based upon an investigation of
charges made for electric service^ih o*h
er cities of this state. In this connec
tion it must be stated that a large num^
ber of Minnesota Municipalities are re
vising their electric rates and that wher
ever a change is made it is downwards.
We are of the opinion that the above
schedules of rates will amount to a sub-.
stantial reduction in the
c0st
The above rates is the beet rate we
have been able to Secure, and from our
investigation of the' question and the
facts at hand we are of the oirinlon that
the rates above set forth are reasonable
as a comparative rate:
Dated this 13th day of October, 1916.

Little Falls, Minn., Oct. 18, 1»16.
To the Common Council of the City of
Little Falls:
Gentlemen: The undersigned, one of
the Electric Light Schedule committee,
would have much preferred to concur
wholly with the majority rieport of the
committee, but is unable to do so in
some respects.
He does not believe that the proposed
rates will make for a substantial de
crease in the cost of electric lighting to
patrons generally. In the residehce
lighting.' there is apparently a' general
decrease in those having an installation
of. the average of six lights or more, the
consumers being in number.241. Of those
having less than the average of six, they
will apparently either pay a slight in
crease or .remain as they are under the
minimum charge of one dollar per
month. In this class are numbered 871
consumers as. against the 241. The num
ber of exceptions in one class will no
doubt equal the number of those in the
other, so that this average seems a rea
sonable one. There are also about 30
consumers who are at this time on a.
two-light flat rate of 60 cents, if they So
remain there will in effect be a sixty-cent
minimum. If they «re placed on the
schedule rate it Is very apparent that
there will, be an increase of .40. cents to
each of these patrons.
In the commercial class there is a to
tal of 148 users. Taking the average of
12 drops and 74 kilowatts consumed per
month shows a general increased of 43
cents to each patron. Taking'this state
ment as an apparent fact and with the
statement that those having the larger
number of drops will be the greatest
gainers, although there, are some excep
tions, it is obvious that those receiving
the benefits of the decrease Will conife
from the class above the 12-drop aver
age, who numer 42, a number of which
are also increased. The users of over 12
drops number 42, or much less than one
third of the commercial lightning pay
trbns. It is therefore quite apparent that
mju6h'1the larfcer number of these 1
users will either remain at the minimum
of' the one dollar charge or be increased^
It might be stated that there are some
sharp decreases among the commercial
light users, under the proposed rate, but
it seems to me this but shows that the
cost of lighting has been too high.
it seems to me, that the, company has
accepted or agreed to a schedule whicn
will amount in the aggregate ..to them
practically the same sum as' uh'der the
drop system, with possibly the exception
of some sharp decreases, which conclu
sion pretty nearly agrees *ith the stat^-
Jk meeting ofj the Comrnerclal club was,
scheduled' for 'Monday Evening, but only]
a few members appeared- and it was in-:
definitely postponed.

GftANITE CITY HIGH SCHOOL BLilV-'
EN TO CLASH WITH LOCALS
HERE TOMORROW
Tomorrow afternoon, at the fair
grounds, the high school fobtbilt^elteven
will seek to conquer another oC-,itS' foes,
the St. Cloud high school team, the ag
gregation that has usually been the
hardest one the locals have had to .VMfet.
They do not anticipate a very bard
struggle this time, however, as the Gran
ite city team was late in getting start
ed. They were defeated by Litchfield
last Saturday by a score of 16 to 13.
Several changes will .be necessary in:
the lineup for tomorrow's g6me ias.
Grimes, who has been playing guard in
a very able manner, will not be able to
play. Coach Llljedahl is going to work
so much harder with the boys,
and will probably put one of the taekles -p
in the place .-of Grimes and-use a::sdb
tackle. St. Cloud will probably, be rep
resented by Captain Alexander, Bet
tendorf, rg Wiley, Ig Whiting, rt Har
rington, le Qulnlivan, re Citnnemann,
rh Carlson, lh Peterson, fb, and Fow
ler, qb.
A week from tomorrow the locals. Jour
ney to Brainerd for a return game and
the following Saturday they play Anoka
here. Anoka is said to have a very fast
team this: year.
