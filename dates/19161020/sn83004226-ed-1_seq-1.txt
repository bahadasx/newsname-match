his speeches. He was treated with the

Hughes because It Is his tlrst n-.ubence

that his utternnces contained any

paid him for the clothe according to
his agreement, and they began to argue
about It. whjch resulted In the fluht.
When they met again there were three

THE FRASUHE CASE
IAKbS ENTIRE WEEK
LAWRENCE CIRCUIT COURT NOW.
TAKING UP THE CASE OF
WEBB HOLT.
When the NEWS went to press Inst
week a jury had just been comple'ed to
try Robert Fraiser for murder. The evi
dence in this case was finished Tues
day evening, the arguments were mad
Wedneaday and the Jury now has. the
fate of the defendant in its hands.
This case waa transferred from the
Carter Circuit Court, after having been
tried there twice, the first time result
ing In a hung Jury and the second be
ing a life sentence. Fraiser served Fcv
eral months in the penitentiary and the
Court of Appeals granted him a new
trial. He lives at Ewlng. Fleming -co.,
having moved there a few years ngo
from Floyd-co. His father is Evn:i S.
Fraiser, a citizen of excellent reputa
tion. Robert nlso proved a good repu
tation up to the time of this trouble.
He Is 32 yenrs old and has a wife and
children. His Wife Is a daughter of
Henry C. Hopsoh, of Reaver, Floyd-co.
. Frasler Is accused of killing his' sis
ter"s daughter, Miss Stella Kinney, age
17, whlise father is Hatfield Kinney,
formerly of Floyd-co., but now of Car
ter. The evidence Is summed up as fol
lows: Mlsa Kinney had been at Fraster'B
home for ten months. On May 2, 191G,
at 4 a, tn., he and the girl started til
drive through tho country to the home
of her u rents near Grayson. At about
7:30 p. m. a few citizens of Olive Hill
wera startled by the screams of a wo
man, und later the cries of a man were
heard calling for a light. A short dis
tance outside of town these people
found the girl lying unconscious In the
road, with seven cuts made by a heavy
instrument, such as a hatchet might
make. Three of the wounds were on
her head. Frasler had Blight abrasions
on his hand and forehead, and a bruise
on the side of his head. He told the
first man he met that two men had
stopped them, one taking hold of the
horse and the other skulking up behind
tho buggy and striking the girl with a
heavy club and then felling him with
the same Implement. He said they rob
bed him of (27 and a check. No blood
was found on the buggy. The girl's
clothing was nearly covered with blood
and mud. There was evidence of a
struggle In the road extending for some
distance. Frasler's watch and fountain
pen were found along the course of this
struggle. A tap off of the heel of the
girls Bhoe was found also. It was
proved that Frasler had a flashlight In
his pocke' at the t'Tie he called for a
light; but did not produce It.
Miss Kinney lived until some time
tho next day and was taken on home,
a distance of about 10 miles. She nev
er regained consciousness. An autopsy
was performed and Bhe was found to
have been In a delicate condition. In
supporting its contention that Frasier
was the author of her trouble the com
monwealth proved the girl to have been
a very timid girl who did not go out,
but remained closely about the home.
Two physicians testified about appli
cations made by Frasier for medicine
to relieve such cases. One of these was
Dr. Walker Stambaugh, of Floyd-co.
Frasler Is a merchant and has a clerk
In his store. It Is said this clerk sug
gested that Frasler take with him on
this trip a pistol that waa in the Btore.
but ho said he would leave that and
take a hatchet so if they had a break
down he could repair it. Frasier ad
mitted this on tho witness stand, ex
cept he said he would take a hatchet
or an ax. Neither of such implements
was found in the vicinity of the trng
edy. .
Speeches were made for the defense
by W. T. Cain, of I.ouisa, W. S. Har
kins, of Frestonsburg, and. Mr. Morford
of Fleming-co. Complimentary words
ure heard about these speeches, and al
so as to the speeches made for the com
monwealth by John M. Waugh and
Thos. Yates. The latter is County at
torney of Carter. Mr. Harkins spoke
about three hours Wednesday after
noon and Mr. Win gh made his argu
ment Thursday morning. The case then
went to the Jury and is still In their
hands.
The Jury came out at 3 o'clock and
said they could not agree. Judge Cisco
sent them back to try again.
The Robt. Biggs murder case, from
Carter-co. has been continued to the
next term.
: In the Webb Holt case the common
wealth announced ready, but the de
fense Is trying for a continuance.
THE HOME DEMONSTRATOR.
Miss Palrlee Davis will leave Loul.a
within a few days to return to her
home In Christlan-co., having finished
the year's work here as Home Demon
strator for Lawrence county. She car
ries with her the best wishes of the
many friends she has made while here,
and it is hoped she will return to this
County next year. We have heard a
number of the best people In the coun
ty say that Miss Darts has done ex
cellent work in the country and that
they are very anxious for her return.
In Louisa she has been very helpful
also. She is comiietent, industrious
pleasant and tactful, and the younger
generation esiiecially have been bene
fitted by the improved methods being
iiurisJuced by the L'nited Stales thru
these demonstration agents. It is a
great work and the people should Ho
receive it and take advantage of the
pportunities thus offered for learning
the best methods.
"he fiscal court hy a close vote re
fused to pay half of the expense for
another year. The government pays
half. This year and last the people
of Louisa subscribed and paid the
amount required to secure a Home
Demonstrator. It Is iiot a very large
nmnunt less than half what the Coun
ty -Agent costs and it should be paid
by the county.

OIL FOUND IN
FINE LUBRICATING OIL 8TRUCK
;..;. AT DEPTH OF 360 FEET
ON LAUREL.
A heavy lubricating oil haa been
found In Lawrence county on upper
Laurel creek, a few miles from Blaine.
. Mr. Albin, who has a large boun
dary of leases In that territory, had tho
good fortune to strike this oil in the
first test'well drilled on the property.
The oil was found at a depth of 840
feet several days ago and the matter
was kept as quite aa possible until a
day or two ago.
The well Is on the farm of Felix
Fyffe. It is about four miles southwest
of the best well drilled 32 years ago
by R. F. Vinson and others, of this
place. That well was on the old Blllie
Edwards farm. , It was a fine produc
er, but waa lost by sending the drill on
down through the sand Into a strong
water vein which could not be shut off
or Controlled.
V The oil is the highest grade of lubri
cant, of a dark green color. The old
abandoned wells have been flowing in
small quantities during all these years
and the owners of the land sell it for
lubricating purposes at 30c per gallon.
Gas Is also produced by some of tho
wells and Is utilized to some extent for
heating and lighting.
The excitement usually following
these fields is beginning to show Itself
and will no doubt reach fever heat
soon.. .
It Is said the 15 gallons per hour la
being ballet : out of the well with a
sand pump. -This Is thought to IndU
cate a very profitable strike. The depth
which the drill w.'i sent into the pro
ducing sand Is said f.o be four feet. The
experience of the former operators in
this field causes caution on this point.
IT WAS ENOUGH TO 1 '
8T0P THE CLOCK.
When the Jury returned a verdict of
not guilty In the case of U. 8. vs. R. L.
Simpkins, et al., for conspiracy In the
1914 election, the large clock which has
been in the Federal building for many
years and was never known to atop be
fore, suddenly ceased to run, on the
very minute that tho verdict of acquit
tal waa returned.
Bolsy Green, a colored janitor In the
building ventured the prophesy that If
the Rockhouse ballot thieves and con
spirators were acquitted, the big clock
would fall flat on the floor. At any rate,
the clock ia not runnlng-can't be
started and It may or may not have
been prostrated by the verdict which
shocked almost the entire state. The
fact remains that its long hands point
mutely and immovably to the very
minute when the Jury returned the
astounding verdict. Williamson News.
