John Hurley, candidate for Judge '
of the Seventeenth Judicial District,
is recognized as having ability, up-j
rlghtness, ami all the necessary'quali- '
fications to fill the office. The over
-whelming majority by which he was
n ominated at the primaries over his
opponent, is a flattering tribute to the
value placed upon his qualifications
by the voters and indicates that the
results on November 7th will find him
elected to the judgeship. He can
be depended upon to conduct the Dis
trict Court business without prejudice
or favor and give everyone a square:
deal.
No man in Valley county is better
known than R. J. Moore, candidate for
Miuwii um.1 B.iuuurc, cam..™« iu.
State Senator as his long residence
in Glasgow and the development of
the Moore Telephone Co., now the
xne ivioure v.u., i.u.y w.v.
Four Valleys Telephone Company has
brought him in touch with the greater
portion of the people. Mr. Moore
served in the 12th legislative session
in the house as Representative from
Valley county and created a record for
hard work there. He introduced
House Bill No. 251 for the establish
nient of an experimental station of
the Agricultural Department in Val
ley county and as a result of this bill
being introduced the sub-experimental
station was established upon the Wm.
Leonard farm six miles east of Glas
Leonard farm six miles east of Glas
gow. This was the first legislation
ever attempted for the agricultural in- j
terests of this county in the legisla-|
ture of the state. By sending Mr. |
Moore to the Senate the taxpayers
of this county will be assured of hav
ing a man there who will watch their
interests all the time and will secure
such necessary legislation for the
county as is desired. ;
Three men are to be sent to the
legislature as representatives from
this county and the three who were
nominated on the Republican ticket
are competent to work for the inter- j
ests of Valley County and will do so,
if elected. Jesse L. Hoke operates a
large farm at Vandalia, has had years
of experience in the development of
this section of the state and knows
the need of proper legislation to fur-.will
ther the interests of the people here. !
He can be depended upon to do all that !
can be done for the benefit of the
farmers of Valley county. J. R. Mur- j
phy of Nashua, is a successful lum-jness
ber merchant who has shown his
ness ability during the rapid growth
and development of that city and is
a man well qualified to care for the 1
best interests of this county in all
legislation brought up for considéra- j
tion. E. T. Phelps of Baylor, is well
known throughout the north country'a
where he has assisted many home
steaders in securing desirable land
to farm. He knows the needs of the
new settler in this county and is ably
qualified to work for legislation that;
will be to their best interests, as he
is a man of keen insight and ability. |
Carl J. Anderson, candidate to sue
ceed himself as county commissioner
for the six year term, has served a 1
two year term and during that time
has demonstrated his interest in the
welfare of the county by carefully
guarding the taxpayers interests at
all times. His work on the board ofi
county commissioners has been such
as to demonstrate his business ability,
He has at all time exerted every effort
to keep the expenses of the county
down to the very lowest possible am-1

Julius Waber, candidate for the two
year term to succeed C. W. Baylor)
' who resigned to run for another office,
is a well known business man of
Hinsdale where he operates a drug
store and is interested in the general
merchandise business. He is f am
iliar with the condition of Valley coun
ty having been a resident here for
many years and can give the taxpay

has conducted the office with economy,
..»o w.„ j
to the taxpayers, and by his watch
fulness of the expenses has reduced
the cost of operating this important
department of the county a very con
siderable amount. Law and order
have been enforced to the very limit
in the county during the tenture of
office by Mr. Powell, and in addition
his office has been the means of clean
ing up several tough bunches of stock
thieves, who were operating in vari
ous parts of the county. The popu-1
the coun-1
larity of "Puck" throughout the coun-1
ty, combined with his good business
administration points to his being re- :
turned Sheriff at the coming election, j
W. B. Shoemaker, the present Coun
ty Clerk and Recorder is a candidate
to succeed himself and if efficiency in
office and honest economical and
prompt service is a recommendation |
then Mr. Shoemaker has the highest;
of recommendations and reasons to
be re-elected to this office. During
the present term of his encumbrancy
he has performed the duties of the
office extrerrely we.l and with the u.-s
of a mu"h smaller force than his pre
decessor ,-e ; .rdle -s of the fact that
the work of the office has praetie illy
doubled dunng the past two years,
Thousands of dollars have in this man
ner been saved by him to the taxpay
ers and the good record he has made
bring him success at the polls in
November.
! The office of Clerk of the District
Court is one of the important ones
j requiring ability to handle the busi
lum-jness passing through it. Walter
busi-jshanley, the present incumbent has,
during his four years in this office,
demonstrated his ability to serve the
1 taxpayers to their satisfaction, being
ever prompt, courteous and ready at
j all times to attend the duties it re-1
quires. His re-election will return
man to the office who will continue
to serve the people properly.
T. M. Patten has been a resident of
Valley county for many years and is
favorably known throughout its length
and breadth. As County Treasurer
he has been efficient, economical, and
| honest in every detail, making a rec
ord for handling the financial affairs
of the county which stands out above
1 all others. He is without any oppo
sition for this office as it is recognized
by the voters that no improvement can
be made by a change, and his return
'to the office in November is assured,
The first County Assessor Valley
county has had in many years who
performed the duties of his office in
a business like manner, is B. H. Cot
trell of Hinsdale. He is now com
pleting his first term and the county
has been enriched many hundreds of
dollars through his safeguarding the
taxes in collecting them from those I
who have not been rounded up inj
years past. The taxpayer can rest!
assured that as long as "Ben" is in J
the assessor's office all who should,!
will pay taxes and there will be an ev -j
er present watchman to see that none
escape. The voters will do well to;
keep him where he is.
C. I). Borton, candidate for the of

WELLS BROTHERS
OCCUPY NEW STORE
Move Into New Modern Quarters On
Second Avenue South.
1 One of the important events in the
business affairs of Glasgow occurred
; the first of the week when Wells Bros.,
who operate the City Meat Market,
moved into their new concrete store
j building, located on Second Avenue
South. The building was recently
completed and new modern fixt ires
! an( i equipment installed. All the,
sanitary features of modern inven
tion have been added to the already
complete furniture of the establish
ment and the customers of this store
, i •
will find their health safeguardel inj
He'wfy conceivable way. Wells Bros.
have been one of the progressive firms,
- - .
°f Glasgow since they started in bu"
ness here some two years age and
have demonstrated their ability by he
rapid strides made in a business way,
and th< extensive trade they have built
U P- Their patrons have been
treated in such a manner as to en
able Wells Bros, to not only retain all
the trade of the business when they
purchased it but they have increased
; the business most wonderfully.
The new store building is 30x60^
feet in size and has a most attractive
front, the windows being wide and
: deep showing a clear view throughout
j the entire length of the store. The
lighting system is of the newest de
sign. Glasgow is fortunate in hav
ing such hustling business men locat
ed here.

After the Clayton Bill Had Passed Both House and Senate,
Conference Committee Altered It Beyond
All Possible Recognition.
~~~~~~~~
No Penatly for Evading Law
"When that bill returned from con
ference and was signed by the Presi
dent and it became a law, it was so
altered that its own father would not
have recognized it should he have
met it in the middle of the road,"
was the characteristic manner in which
Senator Geo. W. Norris of Nebraska
described the Democratic measure
known as the Clayton Bill. He fur
ther stated that the b,11 as it came
from the house to the senate was a
fairly good one and that after a few
amendments were made to it in the
senate and it had passed that body it
went to the conference committee
where it was so altered, by direction
from the White House, that it was a
failure as far as doing what it was in
tended to do. He then sighted one
instance of the many, wherein the
"teeth were taken out of the trust
board. Many difficult problems are!
constantly arising and it is absolutely ,
necessary that one well versed in the
duties of the office be placed there
to continue the upbuilding of the
school facilities in keeping with the,
rapid increasing populaton. This,
situation has been handled most ad
mirabiy by Miss Johonnott during the
past 18 months she has been the depu -J
ty superintendent, and should bring
her a big majority of votes in No
one of great importance just at this
time when there are so many demands
ma(!e upon the county funds for the
building of new roads in districts
, .. ,, , ..
where practically no revenue is forth-|
up-looming. W. H. Mann has during the
term of his office shown he has the
qualifications needed to serve the coun-j
ty in this important office in such a
manner as to save thousands of dol
lars to the taxpayers. He should
, , . , ,
be re-elected by the voters of the,

department will continue.

■ Sergeant Mundy, the latter doing a
great deal of detail work which
brought about the final locating of
the two men who are now under ar
rest. Sergeant Mundy worked hard
and with the assistance rendered by
the Sheriff's office they were finally
rewarded by securing the men who
are supposed to be the leaders of
the alleged gang. These men were
trailed from Canada, where they had
rounded up a bunch of horses, which
it is supposed they were about to run
across the border into the United
States, but dropped them when they
learned the officers were on their trail.
The route they "took into this section
was ascertained through the finding
of two horses which they had killed
in making their way through to the
j main line of the Great Northern after
leaving Canada.
John Anderson, who has been liv
ing at Dodson under the name of Mil
ler, has a record for horse stealing
and was out on parole from a five

; year sentence received in Canada. He
J ,
ha.l been paroled upon condition that

tiary.
Work still being done by the sher
iff's office here will probably result
in further arrests which will effective
ly break up the gang of stock rustlers.
In an interview, just before leav-'
ing for Assinniboine, Sask., where he
is stationed Staff Sergeant Robt. B.
C. Mundy asserted that he wished to
express his great appreciation of the
excellent services rendered by Sheriff
Powell and his force of deputies in
connection with the arrest of Ander
son and Sparks, charged with horse
stealing in Canada. He stated their
arrest is of as vital importance to
stockmen in the United States as to
those in Canada and the breaking up
of this gang is to be commended.
