When President B. F. Burge
brout down the gavel that closed
the 23rd session of ths International
Irrigation Congress, ths great El
Paso meeting eould be set down as
atec-mplitflr.n More real good than
any congress in years. Ail improve
ment in laws to benefit the western
farmers can bed ireetly traeable to
the influence of thia congress.
A whole lot of good legislation was
suggested to benefit the farmer, the
cattleman and sheepman and make
conditions much easier to succeed.
In fact, when the legislation suggest
ed shall have been put into law there
will be slim chance for failure in any
arid states.
Perhaps tbe proposed legislatioii
of the most importance to the Mim
ores Valley to embraced in tho fol
lowing clipping from Wednesday's Kl
Paso Herald:
"Delegates to the International Ir-
rigatioa congress will go on record as
favoring government assistance in
tha development of pomp irrigation
in tho west, according to ths action
of the resolutions committee, which
today unanimously aeeepted a reso
lution proposed by Willard E. Holt,
delegate from the Dealing Chamber
of Commerce to the congress: The
lion follows:
jsraaa ths Ucltii CUtos gov
ern ant has appropriated from timei
to time many millions of dollars for
the purpose of storing surf sea waters
for the reclamation of arid lands and,
"Whereas, there are millions ot
acres of valuable land that can be
reclaimed by means of pumping foi
irrigation, which are not given any
enennrngement by the Federal gov
eminent, therefore, Itc it
"ltcolved, that the preii1et of
this congress appoint one man from
each arid or semi-arid state in the
west for tbe pni-pose of a conference
looking toward united action in se
curing federal aid for the reclama
tion of lands that may be profitably
irrigated by means of pnmping from
the underground waters."
It was not only accepted by the
resolutions committee, but the vote
was perfectly unanimous in tbe con
gress. To note tbe widespread interest in
the movement, it is pleasing to know
that the motion to ndnpt it was made J
by one of the delegates from Ohio.
The new president of the congress,
Hon. George Albert Smith, of Salt
Lake City, was kind enough to ap
point the Graphic editor as chairman
of the delegation which will include
the ftate engineers of sixteen states,
and will incidentally bring great pub
licity for the Mimbres Valley, as all
movements wil he directed from
Deming.
The Chamber of Commerce will co
otcrate in keeping this region in the
'inwligbt.

Fcrxra of a CUU
The problem of marketing farm
products in New Mexico to at the
present tin to practically all problem
and ao eolation. New Mexico to on
of ths leven state which have no
otaeial marketing bureau, or which,
outside of tee help rendered by coun
ty agricultural agents, give no aid to
tha farmer to the marktlJig of his
products.
Ths New Msxioo Agricultural Col-
leg has planned a marketing bureau
to be conducted cooperatively by its
extension department and tbe office
od markets and rural organisation
of the United States Department of
Agriculture; and arrangements have
been effected whereby an expert will
taker barge of such bureau on Jan
uary 1.
Iet us see what the coudtions are
with which be will be confronted:
The land area of New Mexico em
braces 78,401,020 acres. Tho census
of 1010 shows that approximately
ons snd one-half million acres of this
land was in improved land farms, and
about one-third of them were under
irrigation. At the present time,
about one million acres are under ir
rigation, and perhaps two milliou
acres, altogether, in improved toad
farms. About two and one-half per
cent of tbe state's area is therefor,
in farms, while the remaining ninety
seven and one-half per cent is most
ly devoted to the grating of cattle,
sheep ami goats.
The principal agricultural products
of New Mexico, aside from livestock,
dairying, and poultry raising are hay,
corn, wheat, oats, beans, fruits, (in
cluding apples, pears, peaches and
cantaloupes), and vegetables. Tbe
areas eultvated by these crops, ex
cept for hay have been increasing
rapidly and will continue to increase
for some years. The yield per aero
is increasing satisfactorily.
The estimated value of the farm
crops in New Mexico in 1015 was
015,633,000, and in 1900 was 910,.
000,500.
The estimated value of livestock
sales in 1015 is $21,000,000 ngninst
1 1,000,000 in 1900.
From thr above figures it will be
seen that the principal agricultural
products of the state with the ex
ception of hay, doubled in value in
the pant six years.
The bean crop in the state, through
the t'evelopment of our dry farms, is
rapidly becoming vt-ry imxrtant, and
will thix year approximate in value
2.000,000.
During the last three years the
number of sheep in the state have in-
crensed by one hundred and forty
thousand: the number of cattle by
two hundred thousand : the number of
horses by forty-seven thousand,
the number of dairy cows by twenty
thousand and the number ofswine by
flftv-fonr thousand five hundred.
Through the Boys' and Girls' clubs
hundreds of pure bred swine have
been imported and distributed. Thru
the college also a large number of
graded dairy rows and pure bred
bulls have been imported and distrib
uted. No state in the anion is better a
dnpted to the successful raising of
poultry than New Mexico. The turk
ey industry is in good shape, but is
cspshle of enormous increase. Tbe
hen industry, of thes tate does not
begin to snpply the enormous demand
for eggs. The average yield of er
is only four and a half doxen to t"..e
hen, while for meat they are very
light weight, running mostly to ne ' s
and le-rs. Tbe college ia of eo- i,
