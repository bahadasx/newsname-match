RECORD
Senator Key Pittman
Creates Enthusiasm
JUNIOR SENATOR FROM NEVADA DELIVERS A STIRRING ADDRESS
TO A PIOCHE AUDIENCE DEFENDS HIS ACTIONS IN THE
LAND GRANT BILLS SPEAKS ON NATIONAL ISSUES
One of the best political speeches
ever heard in Pioche was the one
delivered at Thompson's ball last
Saturday night by Senator Key
Pittman. The senator defended the
administration of President Wilson
In the strongest terms and appealed
to the voters to retain the present
chief executive of the nation for
another four years. He discussed
to some length the great national
issues of the campaign.
He defended his acts in reference
to the land bills introduced by him-
Belf in congress, for which he had
been criticized by his . opponents.
Senator Pittman contended that
the land bill, while of importance
to the state was a very small mat
ter in comparison to the many great
(isues. He expressed regret that
his opponents would not take a
stand on the great questions of the
dav.
"My record shows wehere I stand.
I would like to know where my op
ponents stand." In discussing the
land grant bill Senator Pittman
said:
There are 70,000.000 acres of
land in Nevada of which the govern
ment still owns sixty-two million
acres. There are two questions.
First, get some money for the
schools out of some of the land.
Second, settle the land. The nation
al laws have so far failed to settle
the land. Iu fifty years we have on
ly had one thousand homesteaders.
I passed at the same time three
bills to accomplish such purposes;
viz: the grant bill to raise a perma
nent fund from the interest on
which we might support the public
schools and the university 80 epr
cent to the schools and 20 per cent
to the university. Another bill to
permit homesteadlng by annual im
provement without the necessity of
residence. Another bill to encour
age discovery and development of
artesian and subsurface waters.
STATE OF NEVADA
SS
Under the provisions of this bill a
citizen can locate 4 sections, have
two years to prospect for water,
and if he develops enough water to
practically irrigate 20 acres he gets
one section for nothing as a bonus
or in payment of service.
My grant bill when introduced
by me did not contain the auction
clause. It was insisted upon by
every member of the senate. Sen
ator LaFollett led the fight for
such provision lie said that all
similar grants to other states since
1872 had contained such proviaicn.
He said that the school should be
protected in the receipt of the full
value of the land or the bill should
not pass. So if you want the grant
for the schols you must accept it
with such provision. Senator Pitt
man called attention to the fact that
Congressman Roberts supported the
bill in the house of representatives,
and that every senator after a three
days' debate voted for the bill.
Senator Pittman was preceeded
by Edwin F. Caine, Democratic
nominee for member of the house
of representatives; Judge J.-' A.
Sanders, nominee of the Democratic
convention for the office of asso
ciate justice of the supreme court
of Nevada, who addressed the au
dience briefly, as it was necessary
for them to leave the meeting' in
order to catch jai.ra.ln . at Cadenta
for a campaign tour of Clark coun
ty. .Both these candidates were en
thusiastically received as was Wil
liam Kennett, Democratic nominee
for clerk of the supreme court.
Judgi Horsey acted as chutruia.i
of the meeting.
Senator Pittman addressed a
meeting at Panaca Sunda atter
noon and was the chief speaker at
a rousing rally at Callenfa Surdi
evening. At the latter meeting Son
ator J. A. Denton acted as chair
man.

SENATORIAL CANDIDATE
MAKES HIS ANNOUNCEMENT
The announcement of W. T. Stew
art, Sr., Democratic nominee for the
office of state senator, appears in
this issue. Mr. Stewart needs no
introduction to the people of Lin
coln county, for he is generally well
known to all, and is a good citizen.
He is a resident of Alamo where he
is engaged in farming and livestock
business. Mr. Stewart has held one
political office in this county having
served as a member of the board of
county commissioners, in which ca
pacity he was found to always per
form his duty as he saw It for the
interests of all the people of the
county. He ran for the office for
which he now seeks two years ago,
but was defeated by Senator M. L.
Lee by the narrow margin of. 23
votes. Should he be successful in
this campaign he would go to the
upper house of the Legislature at
Carson City not entirely inexper
ienced, for he served as a member
of the Utah legislature before he
took up his permanent residence in
Nevada a number of years ago, and
is therefore, well fitted to carry out
the wishes of his constituency. He
was nominated by the Democratic
convention which met at Pioche on
September 19th, without opposition
his party having selected him as
the one best qualified to for the sen
atorial race. Mr. Stewart has been
succesful as a business man, and
the old saying that "the man who
has been successful as a business
man makes the safest lawmaker"
applies to Mr. Stewart.

The card of Thomas F. (Barney)
Moran, Republican candidate for
associate Justice of the supreme
court, appears in this issue. Judge
Moran has gone through the usual
steps that are supposed to fit a
man for the highest Judicial office
in the state. He has been an attor
ney, a district attorney, a district
Judge for two terms comprising six
years on the bench of Washoe coun
ty where he still is judge and he has
the respect and confidence of all
who know him. !
Cast upon his own resources at
the age of 10 years he acquired his
education while working as a tele
grapher, railroad man and dispatch
er. He cast his lot with Nevada in
1884 at the age of 15 and in all the
decisions he has written he has nev
er been charged with unfairness or
partisanship. The Judicial nomi
nees this year although selected by
the party conventions, go on the
ticket without party designation as
a result of a desire of the people ex
presseld by the last legislature to
take the Judiciary out of politics,

The caterpillar tractor put on re

ore from the mine to Indian Springs,
made its first trip last week. Four
trailers were used and 23 tons deliv
ered at the station. The driver says
the road is one of the best he has
worked over, and that with a little
more driggins, to level up and free
the road of loose rocks, the full six
trailers can be used and 35 tons tak
en at a load, or trip. This effectively
settles the hauling question for the
Groom section. ' "
Parties have taken a lease on the
James Kelly mines situated about
12 miles south of Groom and will
pull their first car of ore out with a
Ford truck. The truck was put on
the road for that purpose last week.
