HUGHES REPLIES
TO STATEMENT
MADE BY BAKER
ABOUTWARHEROES
pTot a True American Statement, Says
Candidate in Answer to
Attack.
BEPUES TO ADDRESS
OF SECRETARY M'ADOO
Beiterates That He Meant What He
Said in Regard to Lusitania
Affair.
Youngstown, O., Oct. 20.Charles
E. Hughes reiterated last night that
he meant what he said in Louisville
recently concerning the course he
would have followed with reference
to the Lusitania. He replied to a
recent utterance of Secretary Mc
Adoo, with the declaration that ap
parently it seemed impossible to the
administration that a person could
believe what he said.
Answers McAdoo.
"Now rises the secretary of the
treasury to complain that this was
not a statement of what I would have
done had the sinking occurred," Mr.
Hughes said, after reiterating that he
would "have stated his position
equivocally" in advance of the
sinking. "I was under the impression
that when I said what I would have
stated in advance as to what I would
do, everyone would know that I stated
What in fact I would have done in the
sscribed event. The secretary's re
marks show in an illuminating way
this administration's conceptions of
the value of .words."
Mr. Hughes spoke before an audi
ence in the theater here. He also re
plied to a statement attributed to
Secretary of War Baker in a recent
speech in which Washington soldiers
In the march to Valley Forge ,in the
days of the American revolution were
said to be just as bad characters
the Mexicans.
Attacks Baker's Talk.
"I never supposed the day would
come," Mr. Hughes said, "when the
representative of an American ad
ministration would say that of those
ho gave us our liberty."
After quoting- the statement attri
buted to Secretary Baker, Mr. Hughes
read from Secretary Lansing's de
scription in June last of the atrocities
in Mexico contained in a note to the
de facto government of Mexico. Mr.
Lansing's recital of the civic strife
In Mexico, with its appendant loss
of American lives and destruction of
.American property, and that portion
of the note relating to the Santa
Ysabel massacre, were read by Mr.
""^pghes verbatum.
"An administration imbued with
.he spirit of true Americanism," Mr.
Hughes said, "would be incapable of
the statement attributed to the secre
tary of war. It must bring the blush
of shame to the cheeks of every
American that apologies for the de
plorable record in Mexico should be
made after this fashion."
SUPREME COURT
HEARS PRICE CASE
(By United Press)
St. Paul, Minn., Oct. 20.The
Minnesota supreme court today heard
arguments on the appeal of Frederick
T. Price, for life imprisonment at
Stillwater prison, for murdering his
wife, Mary Fridley Price.
In the Hennepin county court at
Minneapolis, Price was found guilty
of throwing the little woman over
a cliff to her death on the jagged
rocks below a precipice on the Mis
sissippi river drive. Life imprison
ment was the sentence.
DECLINED TO PERMIT A
SQUADRON TO DEFEND
AMERICANS.
At Tampico there was a gen
eral movement of attack by the
Mexicans on Americans and
other foreigners. We had a
squadron of American warships
in the neighborhood. The Wil
son Administration declined to
permit this squadron to be used
to defend the lives of American
men and the honor of American
women, and the commanders o*
the German and English ships
at Tampico had to step in and
perform the task our represen
tative had so basely abandoned.
At the very time that the Mexi
can mob had surrounded the
building in which the Americans
had taken refuge, and was howl
ing for their blood, the Ameri
can fleet, in spite of the pro
tests of the American naval
commander, and in accordance
with wireless orders from Wash
ington, was forced to steam out
of the harbor and leave the Am
ericans to be massacred by the
Mexicans, or rescued by the
Germans and EnglishV-jFrom

Roosevelt, delivered at Lewis

SENSATIONAL
DEVELOPMENTS
IN KOOCHICHING.
INVESTIGATIONS
Highway No. 24 is Made Three Rods
Wide Instead of Four, Accord
ing to Testimony.
HEARING OF COUNTY
COMMISSIONERS BEGUN
International Falls, Minn., Oct. 20.
Fred Harmon of the Northwestern
Construction company, created a sen
sation at the investigation into Koo
chiching county road building yester
day when he swore Assistant County
Engineer Day had insisted they make
highway No. 24 three rods wide in
stead of four. He testified further
that Day had informed him that he
(Harmon) had nothing to say about
the work so long as he (Day) was
satisfied.
Ordered Let Out.
According to the testimony of Har
mon, he went to County Highway En
gineer Ogaard and complained that
Day was allowing some work to be
done so poorly that he was afraid it
would not pass muster. It was soon
after this that the state highway com
mission insisted that Day be "let
out."
Engineer Ogaard was put back on
the stand yesterday afternoon and
Stated he had decided that he was
not the regularly appointed engineer
for highway No. 24. Attorney Ar
nold refreshed his memory with a
copy of his commission, his bond and
13 monthly salary warrants drawn
from Koochiching county during the
construction of highway No. 24. The
salary also covered the 10 weeks
Ogaard was sick and in California.

aWners was again adjourned, this

torney Jevne had not formally re
quested an opinion, but that he would
investigate immediately. He said,
however, that the vacation of office
by former Commissioner McDonald
was a question of fact, and not of law.

F. B. KELLOGG URGES
U. S. PREPAREDNESS
Staples, Minn., Oct. 20.At a big
Republican rally here Frank B. Kel
logg, candidate for United States
senator, and Harold Knutson, can
didate for congress, were the speak
ers.
Mr. Kellogg discussed military and
naval preparedness, foreign relations,
merchant marine and the tariff.
"What this country needs," he
said, "is a small, efficient army, say
of 250,000 to 400,000 men and a navy
for defense. If foreign countries
realize that we are properly prepared
no attack will be made upon us and
it will be the surest safeguard of
peace. The cause of the present war
in Europe was probably intense com
mercial and industrial competition
and struggle for world supremacy,
and that condition must of necessity
in the future involve us. We are ab
solutely secure until the war shall
close but none of the questions that
have threatened our peaceful rela
tions with the belligerent nations
have been settled."

THE NEUTRALITY
OF PONTIUS PILATE.
But as soon as the need for
deeds arose, Mr. Wilson forgot
all about "the principle he held
dear." He promptly announced
that we should be "neutral in
fact as well as in name, in thought
as well as in action," between
the small, weak, unoffending na
tion and the large, strong nation
which was robbing it of its sov
ereignty and independence. Such
neutrality has been compared to
the neu ality of Pontius Pilate.
This is njust to Pontius Pilate,
who at cast gently urged mod
eration on the wrongdoer.

dore Roosevelt, delivered at
Lewiston, Maine, in behalf of
