Spruce street, were today arrested by
the police. -V t
The police asser, that the appre
hension of these two young men. who
are about 25 years of, age, solves the
mysterious disappearance of machines,
which has occurred with such fre
quency the last six months. Reports
have been dally made at headquar
ters by owners that their tnacmneS
.had been stolen and efforts of the po
lice to recover them proved futile.
- The cleverness with .which the two
men' operated succeeded In Baffling
the police, and they probably still
would be at large, but for the fact
that they were seen stealing the ma
chine owned, by Allen A. Kendrick, of
360 Park avenue, from In front of the
Lyric theatre,, last Tuesday night.
- It appears that the men Jointly own
ed an auto,' which according to Lieut.
E. O. Cronan of the detective bureau,
they kept Hn their garage In the rear
of 1188 State street. Suffrln, who is
87 dressy, prosperous-appearing chap,
always had Hunts pose sts his chauf
feur. . '
. , Their method of stealing cars, the
police assert, was planned In the same
manner they pursued In taking the
Kendrick atrtwinobHe, Both drove to
the Ijyrio theatre. One ef them Jump
ed into the Kendrick machine and
drove round to a side street, the other
following with their machine.
The stolen ' car was -fluickly strip
ped of Its aumber plates and the num

be driven to their ' garage, or directly
to New York, while they would use
numbered pieces-of cardboard to re
turn home with their own machine.
In New York both young men. hav
ing the reputation of being second
hand dealers would dispose of the ma

Racer, Lost on Mysterious
Mission. 1
The schooner Vesta, former holder
of a -record trip across the Atlantic
ocean, the subject of half a million dol
lars worth of wagers in 18,66 and later
a submarine tender for the Lake Sub
marine Boat Co., has been wrecked
off the coast of Seal Island while upon
a mysterious trip between Maine and
Nova Scotia. '
In a storm, July 21, which caused

difficulty by fishing vessels in the vi
cinity. , v - ' ,
1 Report of the sinking of the vessel,
which Is said to have flown the
American . flag and to have , been
manned by United States sailors has
.been, made to the authorities at Wash
ington but the destination of the ves
sel and her purpose Is not known. Her
last owners were the j New England
Iron & Metals Co. of New London,
whence she hailed.
Following the close of the Civil
War, schooner racing on. the Atlantic
had great Impetus. As a result of a
wager between Pierre Lorillard, the
noted tobaconnist of New York, and
Commodore Osgood of the New York

feet and her net tonnage, 113. . Oppos
ing' her were the Henrietta and the
Flee twin g. - The race was from Fire
Island, off New York harbor, to the
Needles off ' Southampton, England.
The Henrietta won the race in 13 days,
21 .hours and 65 minutes, covering a
short course of 3,000 miles. The
Fleetwlng,. on a longer course of
8,135 miles, consumed 14 ' days,' 6
hours and 10 minutes, and the Vesta
on the southern course of 3,144 miles,
made the trip in 14 days, 6 hours and
50 minutes.
It is said that nearly half a million
dollars changed hands In New York
as a result of the Interest and betting
displayed In the contest.
Ifi 1908 the Vesta was purchased
by the Lake Submarine Boat Co, as
a tender for submarines then being
built for the government! She re
mained a familiar objects in Bridge

WOULD HAIT U-BOATS
Amsterdam, Oct. 20 A demand
for the stoppage of submarine war
fare coupled with an appeal to the
United States to take the initiative to
ward' that end is voiced by the Tele
graaf. The Telegraaf says: '
"Ten days have elapsed since the
submarine war was carried to the
door of America and nothing has been
done. Are we to understand that
our ships are allowed to be torpedoed
right on the American coast. We say
in all frankness to America that sub
marine war'must be stopped and Ger
many must be told that mistakes,
which all he world know are no mis
takes, will no longer be tolerated. Let
America speak the redeeming words
lest she rue deeply in the future hav
ing neglected a task plainly to be ex
pected from the mightiest neutral."

Through 77 Years Old and
Civil War Veteran.
' Only 83 of the nearly 6,500 who are
eligible to be made voters, had ap
peared before the selectmen at the
common council chamber up to noon
today. There were few ' applicants
during the noon hour, although tne
selectmen expected a rush. After 5
this afternoon the rush is looked for.
Of those who were made voters this J
forenoon more than half were natural
ized citizens and more than half will
voto the Democratic ticket. The
Twelfth district as usual leads with
the largest number of "to be mades.
There are 850 on the lists to be made
from this district. This Includes the
many newcomers who . axe living in
Remington City and other sections of
the irlct where many dwellings
have been erected during the last year.
The Sixth district has the next largest
number of those to be made. Since
the office of the registrars of voters
closed at 5 o'clock lost Saturday after
noon, the registrars have had more
than 500 applications for registration.
They came too late and none of them
can be considered.
The selectmen began their session
today and will be in session every day
hereafter from 9 in the morning until
8 o'clock in the evening, until Oct. 27.
They will also be in session on Mon
day, Nov. 6, to administer the elector's

der, 77 years of age, of 107 Gilbert
street. He is a Civil War veteran and
one of the survivors who took part in
theea fights In Chesapeake bay prior
to the sinking of the Merrimac by the
Monitor. As yet the workers of neither
the Democratic or- the Republican par
ty have started to hustle in those to
be made.
This 'year the board of apportion
ment cut out an item of 27 for meals
which the selectmen put in their ap-
.projjriation and in consequence they.
wllr buy theic own dinners and sup
pers or else eat at home. For years
it had been the custom for the select
men to charge up their meals to the
city, the appropriation allowed for this
purpose ranging between $25 and $50.
Year before last, one selectman went
to Bullen's -and ate a, meal that cost
$5, then he went about bragging of it.
The matter got to the ears of mem
bers of" the board of apportionment
and they cut out the item for meals.
Besides their salaries of $100 each, the
selectmen this year are allowed J20
for the hire of five clerics, $40 for ad
vertising and $15 for stationery.
Thomas F. .White and Benjamin B.

NEMERGUT DEATH
IS BLAMED OPON
DRIVER OF TRUCK
Coroner Phelan Holds Her
man Miller Responsible
For Fatality.
Herman Miller, a motor truck driv
er employed by Patrick McGee, the
coal dealer, was held criminally re
sponsible for the death of John Ne
mergut by Coroner John J. Phelan.
In, his finding the coroner said, "These
acts and the management ' of the
truck evidenced such a lack of care
and Indifference to human safety as
to constitute criminal neglect in the
meaning of the law."
Nemergut lived in Stratford and was
47 years old. He and his wife were
riding in a wagon on Barnum ave
nue on October 14 last. The coal
truck was going in the same direction
and although Nemergut turned to the
extreme right of the road, one of the
wagon wheels was hit by the truck.
Nemergut was thrown to the ground
and fatally injured. The coroner
found that Miller had plenty of room.
He thought the driver should have
stopped or else turned out to avoid a
collision.

ACTRESS: SPOOSE
Madison ' W. Smith Sepa
rated by Superior Court
From Dorothy Maynard.
Dorothy Maynard, Broadway musi
cal comedy favorite, was granted a
divorce in -the superior court this af
ternoon from Madison W. Smith, for
mer Bridgeport High sehool football
player and later a star in the V Prince
of Pllsen" and other musical produc
tions. The actress and her array of
witnesses gave to the occasion the
air of a socialaffair. All the feminine
members of the party were fashion
ably dressed and wore corsage bou
quets. Several of them raised their
lorgnettes and peered curtpusly about
the courtroom.
Mrs. Smith charged that she was
forced to leave her Husband because
of his extreme cruelty. They, were
secretly married in 1903, when she,
too, was a member of "The Prince of
Pilsen" company. She asserted he
frequently threatened to kill her. Once
when they occupied a New , York
apartment he tried to throw her from
a four "story window but she escaped
and ran downstairs in her night cloth
ing. '
Although he had many engage
ments on the stage, Smith seldom gave
his wife anay money for her support
she testified. She said that during
long engagements in -New York, Chi
cago and other large cities, it was her
custom to engage an apartment,
which she occupied with her husband.
She always paid the rent. In May,
1913 Smith's treatment became so bru
tal that she was compelled to leave
him, the actress declared. She has a
home in Norwalk at present. Mrs.
Jeannette !Hoyt, Gladys Norton and
other friends of Mrs. Smith's told of
seeing evidences on the plaintiff that
confirmed the story of her sufferings.
Smith was a son of Ferdinand
Smith, who kept a store at. Fairfield
avenue and Middle street about 21
years ago. In 1895 and 1896 when
Foster and Keane were heroes in High
schooi football circles, Smith was also
a member of the team.

-' - . i . .
James Tocher, Former Local'l
Resident, Found Dead at
' Waterbury.
James Tocher, world-traveler and
soldier of fortune, veteran of the Boer
war and a former resident of this
city, was found dead in bed In his room,
at Waterbury, where be has been liv
ing since he left Bridgeport two years
ago, Wednesday morning. Death was
due to heart failure.
Tocher, when found,' lay with his
head propped high on the pillows in
the bed, a novel open in his lifeless
hands. Eff orts are being made to find
a married sister of the dead man who
resides in Bridgeport and recently
wrote her brother a letter, telling him
the location of his sisters and broth
ers, one of whom now lives In Mon
treal, but failed to mention in the
communication either her own sur
name or the surname of the other
members of the family.
Tocher's career was an adventurous
one. He was born in Canada. When
a young man he left Canada with other
adventurous spirits and went to Eu
rope and China, and when? the Boer
war broke out, to South Africa. He
enlisted. in the Boer ranks and fought
with distinction, receiving several pro
motions and suffering serious wounds
as result of his gallantry.
After the close of the war he went
to Egypt, retraced his steps through
Southern Europe and then came back
to America, settling in this city. As
a result of the industrial boom he lert
this city and went to Waterbury to
work, where he has since been em
ployed. He was a carpenter.

Allowance and Went
To Europe, She Says

stopping her charge accounts at
Fifth avenue shops, William J. Cruik
shank, - wealthy New Yorker, desert
ed his wife, and took a trip to Europe.
That was the testimony of Maude
Foster Cruikshank given before Judge
Gager in the superior court this after

somely dressed, said she . had trouble
with her husband after she accused
him of maintaining apartments for
another woman. In 1910 Cruikshank
began to make matters unpleasant
for his wife and in October of that
year he went away to Europe. He
never lived with his wife after that.
She . established a country home in
Greenwich. She married Cruikshank
December 2, 1896.
John F. Slattery of New Milford

when he was out chopping wood. That
was in November, 1913. When he re
turned with a load of wood his wife
had gone, taking one of the children
with her. The plaintiff said he often
had trouble with his wife because she
liked to go away and stay for a long
time. He married her In 1898.
