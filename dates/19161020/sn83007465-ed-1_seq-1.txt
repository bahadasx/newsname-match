culminated on Tuesday in the organization
of the Lancaster County Na- i

famers everywhere in these associa- i

careful study of the law, in so far as
it is applicable to their interests, are
gratified at the many benefits it of- <

Washington, Oct. 18.?As the result
of studies which have been
made at the Forest Products Laboratory
on methods of handling
wood chipal suitable for paper pulp,
| it is announced that Wisconsin paper
companies are now negotiating
I with the railroads for shipment to
their factories of experimental train
I loads of chips of western w oods
adapted to paper making.
Previous investigations by the
: Forest Service have demonstrated
I that good grades ot paper can be
made from a number of western
woods. The experts now estimate
that some of these woods, when cut
into chips and dried and baled, can
be delivered to the mills in Wisconsin
at a very small advance over the
cost of chips made from local timber
If a favorable freight rate can be
obtained, they say, the great quantity
of pulpwood on the National
Forests should prove to be a considerable
factor in supplying favorably
located paper mills with the necessary
raw material. In Wisconsin
alone it i? utatoH c tw>>-o iu 1
market for over 200.000 cords of
pulpwood.

Writer Discusses Politics and
Community Prosperity?Inesting
News
Primus, Oct. 20.?Mr. Kditor: I
again take the privilege of (lotting
a few lines for The News from one
favoied section of the county. News
of very much interest is real scarce
in this part of the country. The writer
of this article has been real busy
on the farm during the past two
weeks, hence, I haven't been able to
gather very much information, but
.
such as 1 have give I unto you.
The health of the community is
good and the farmers are very busy
gathering their crops and turning
their lands and sowing wheat and
oats. Notwithstanding the high
price of cotton the farmers of this
'community are intent on sowing a
large quantity of small grain, and of
as early variety as they can get to
be able to avoid buying high priced
stuff next spring and summer.
Our school at Red Hill will open
in about two weeks with Miss Kate
Ramsey as teacher. We trust the
patrons will all enter their children
the very first day and continue
them through the entire session.
Mr. E. H. Wright is making arrangements
to move to Great Falls to enter
the mercantile business. Mr.
I Wright is one of our hustling farmers
and we regret very much to
lose him.
Mr. J. A. Rowers, our local sawmill
man. has moved his mill into
the Midway section in Flat Creek
township where he will operate during
the winter.
Mr. Editor: I notice an article in
the last issue of The News, October
13th, headed thus: "The Lillie
white branch where forty Republicans
met over in Spartanburg and
organized a branch of the Republican
party." 1 am not surprised in
the least. The thing reminds me of
the jointed snake; when you strike
the jointed snake a hard blow he
will fly all to pieces, but if you let it
alone it will wiggle back together.
The only way to kill it is to mash its
head. It also reminds us of the
hum- uoys essay on a dog. He said
a dog is an animal with four legs, a
changes them. He wags his tail
when he is glad and sits on it when
he is mad. A dog is a useful animal.
because he bites burglars, but
he is more trouble than he is worth
when he tracks mud on the carpet.
The meeting was a decided success
it goes on to say. 1 notice this
meeting was called under instructions
from one J. Duncan Adams of
Charleston. Mr. Editor, I want to
give notice to the public that J. Dunlean
Adams of Charleston is in
way related to the writer. The ai^9'w^
tide goes on to say other meetings
will be held later with a view of putting
out a ticket in the next election.
In closing on this subject 1
will say the thing that is the most
surprising to nie is that as big a
county as is Spartanburg can't command
but forty pieces, at that rate
the whole State can not get together
enough pieces to comprise the
whole snake.
\ 11 indications point to the biggest
and licst fair yet held in Lancaster.
Let ns all pull together and
make fair week a red letter event for
Lancaster county.
Mrs. Jane Adams, mother of tho
writer of this article, celebrated her
8.r?th birthday Thursday, October
l!?tb. A most enjoyable day was
I spent with many of her friends. It
Iwas with genuine pleasure that we
extended an invitation to our good
editor. Mr. (Kllison, and to Sheriff
John P. Hunter.
There will be preaching at Htgti
: Point church the fifth Sunday in October
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon
bv the pastor. Rev. B. F. Parson.
Mr Kditor, in concluding this ar
tide 1 will say I sympathize with
you in your work. I have complied
with your request in part. I am
sending you the news and 1 trust the
other fellows will send you the hushel
of apples. Much success to the
Lancaster News and its splendid
editor. B. F. ADAMS.
