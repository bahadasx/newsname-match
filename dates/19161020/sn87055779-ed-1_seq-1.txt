HCT IS SUCCESS
Comptroller Tells How-Funds
Are Finding Way Back
to Country Banks.
Intermtlcnal Nexrs SerTlce!
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct. 20.
"My official scalp is not especially
dear to me," said John Klenton Wil
liams, comptroller of the United
States treasury speaking before the
Farmers' National congress today on
the federal reserve act and the rural
credits law.
"I have had a somewhat stormy
time and have been an uncomfort
ably prominent target. Hut my busi
ness is to administer the law and to
do justice." he added to inteVes.el
auditors, who interpreted his re
marks as referring to Pres't Wilson's
lecent statement that one of the
aims of the repuhlicai. party was to
f.et the scalp of the comptroller of
the treasury.
Williams declared that the fed
eral reserve act already is accom
plishing its purpose of decent real
izing and distributing the banking
capital throughout the United
States.
"In four and one-half monlhs th i
deposits in the national banks of:
New York city were reduced $222,-
in Uoston $.16.000. in Philadel
phia $l'l.00," he said. Coincident
ly with the reduction which has
t:.ken place in eastern money cen
ters, the deposits in the country
banks in other cities in the interior
and in the western and north and
the south. hae shown enormous
accumulations."
He asserted th federal reserve
act and the farm loan law would
work hand in jjlove, emancipating
the farmer from hUh rates of in-
leresi nnnerio cuarKeti oy riauouaij
banks, amounting in some cases to
per cent.

Criminal Code Violated by Re

Laws Providing Against Send

Trouble For G.O. P.
Intern nt ion n I News Servbe:
NEW YORK. Oct. 20. Republi
can Chairman Willcox played with
dynamite today when he made pub
lic a letter sent out by the local
democratic finance committee for
the District of Columbia, asking
patriotic American citizens to con
tribute financially to the reelection
of Fres't Wilson. Some of the let
ters reached homes of the federal
employes and Chairman Willcox
seemed greatly excited over it. He
has been tryinp so hard to find an
issue that he is willing to grasp at
anythinp.
II. N. Harper, chairman of the
district finance committee said that
he was usinp the Washington city
directory as r. mailing list and that
under no circumstances were any of
the letters sent to the federal de
partments. Mr. Willcox's statement today is
apt to prove a boomerang for him,
however. It is an appeal to patriotic
citizens and is in tronp contrast with
letters which the republican na
tio: al committee has been sendinp
to civil service employes in federal
auildinps; copies of these letters are
in the hands of the democratic na
tional chaliman. The associates of
Chairman Willcox who sent these
letters to the civtl service employes
at their places of business violated
the criminal code und can be in
dicted. Here is the letter which pot Ile
publican Chairman Willcox excited
today:
"The accomplishments of the ad
ministration sho lid he spread broad
cast and with that object in view
the national democratic committee
lias named i tinance committee to
accept contributions for the honest
dissemination of the actual facts
fully and franl ly stated.
"We therefore ask you to sub
scribe to the general fund as liber
ally as your means will permit.
"You can make check payable to
Wilbur W. Marsh, treasurer, or
ca.di or check to any member of the
tinance committee, or at room V21,
Southern building, where temporary
receipt will be given in the interim
of the receipt which will be mailed
jou direct from New York."
When Vance McCormick, chair
man of the democratic national
committee, saw the Willcox state
ment, he said:
".Mr. Willcox's statement i mere
ly a ijiiibble. n shows how hard
pressed he is for in issue in this
campaign. I have no personal
knowledge of the let.'er he quote.!.
Apparently It was sent out by one
of our finance committees of which
we have many, which are a,skin all
patriotic American citizens to con
tribute toward Pres't Wilson'. re
election. What of it. if one of
these letters happened to pet in the
hands cf a federal office holder. I.
there any law that prohibits an of-
bee
holder from contrihutinp to a

McAdoo, Kern, Taggart, A?.son Meeting Tonight Unusual Opportunity
As a fitting climax to the elaborate democratic activities in South Bend this week there will be held in the audi
torium of the high school building tonight at 8 o'clock probably the most important democratic political gathering
the county has been treated with thus far in the present campaign.
Three speakers will address the meeting, and each is not only a leader in his party but a statesman of national
repute. Their names:
Willi am Gibbs McAdoo, secretary of the United States treasury.
John Worth Kern, United States senator from Indiana.
Thomas Taggart, United States senator from Indiana.
In addition to these eminent statesmen the audience tonight will hear Prof. Stockton Axson, brother of the first
Mrs. Wilson, and a professor at Princeton university.
South Bend and St. Joseph county is highly honored by the presence here of such a collection of the country's
legislators and administrators and the opportunity is one that should not be neglected.
Following on the heels of the visit here yesterday of Pres't Wilson, the speeches here by a member of his cabinet
and two of his most prominent supporters in congress, will portray fully many phases of the Wilson democratic ad
ministration of the nation's affairs.

International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Oct. 20. A se
rious effort to control the increas
ing high cost )f living will he made
following the election. It will in
volve, it -was learned today, the de
partments of justice, labor, com
merce and th? federal trade com
r.itssion. All the facts dealing with the al
le Ped manipulation of prices by
speculators will he prepared for
congressional action should thia
prove necessary. The big question
ot an embarg-o on the export of
foodstuffs will for the tirst time
tome in for serious consideration.
Certain leaders of the master
bakers' organisation of the country
nnd wholesale procers have argued
for months thit Pres't Wilson had
the power to prevent shipments of
wheat. Sources close to the admin
istration strenuously denied this.
Put, with the election out of the
way, the question will be seriously
considered and if it is determined
that some plan is necessary to pre
vent flour and other necessities of
life going to panic prices, it is likely
that conprcss, as responsive to the
will of the people, will be urged to
take action when it meets in De
cember. War to Last Another Year.
Officials for the first time no
admit that the European war will
last all through next year at least.
With crop darrapes here increasing
with (ach report from the country
at large. it is certain that the
T'nite! States vill be denuded of all
foodstuffs unless something is dmf;
to prevent it.
The frank statement by Chancel-'
lor of the Exchequer Reginald lc
Kenna in the Hritish parliament that
his government is spending on every
working day $ 1 0.OnO.tj on in the
United States, simply emphasizes
what already has been ascertained
by the department of oommer-e.
