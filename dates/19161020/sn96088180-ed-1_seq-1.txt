The ,-ry fury of the Oerman

Salllle the Krench removed one of
'the stronger German position de

had repeatedly boHsted was untak

creased the allied breach In the Ger

'more than eleven mile and extended
the Krench possession of the Peronne
flapaume road to four and one-half
mile.
The German liegan rotinter-attnck-lug

part or the village taken hy the
1 Krench Hominy. They swept forward
three time, only to he beaten back.
Approaching Sallly early Wednes
day, we encountered Krench wound
ed, returning from successful resist
ance to those counter-attacks. Thoe

marking the paths toward the dress

'only those moat illgbtly wounded
Jsought ride aboard the, returning
jcnlsaons, while those more severely
wounded, with mangled, swollen arm
showing through bloody bandage,
seemingly preferred walking. Alt the
wounded were smoking cigarettes.
' Automobile ambulances,' enjoying
I the full right-of-way, dashed to-
wards the rear, each bearing four
silent, mud-coated, bloodstained fig
lures. Other ambulances awaited at
the roadside their turn to dash to
ward the battle front. Approaching
nearer tho scene of battle, groups of
slreti herbeurers were visible, carting
off wounded under heavy shell Ore.
; We Dually reached artillery posts
near Comhles, from which the Krench
jattack, launched at 11:45, was plain
ly visible. As the troops dashed up
the hill rockets were set off for the
purpose of directing the barrage fire
with which Krench artillery screened
'their advance. Aeroplanes flew over
jhead, slgnulllng to the rear as each
objective was attained. While we
watched one of these plune was
forced to descend, but succeeded In
alighting within range of the Krench

hour tho French had completed the
'conquest of the village. Then other
groups of soldiers were visible pass

lets and munitions to enable their
comrades to hold the village. The
jqnlck capture of Sallly Is an example
of the present dash of the Krench In
fantry. ' After attaining their pre
scribed objectives, the French pushed
onward, charging the ' dominating

THE WOMAN VOTE
Pittsburg, Oct. 20. The trend Is
to Wilson, and it is trending fast.
Wilson will have the women's vote.
The strongest democratic issue Is
Mexico. These are the views of a
campaigner of some experience
William Jennings Bryan.
Bryan stopped in Pittsburg today
to tell President Wilson. The three
times nominee, headed for Johns
town, Pa., to speak, missed train con
nection and grabbed the chance the
first In the Ave weeks he baa been
on the stump, he said.
"A soldier can not spend his time
talking with the general," said Bryan,
'but this is a fortunate opportunity."
Pennsylvania Is the thirteenth
state Bryan baa spoken In during the
campaign. Before election day be
will bare talked In half as many
more.
"No," lie said "lfa not like 'it
there probably never was one like
that but there is a tremendous
amount of enthusiasm. They are in
terested in the candidates, and I have
been talking about our candidate,"
he said, smilingly, referring to the
charge that another colonel has been
mentioning his candidate very freely.
"The trend is to Wilson. Not only
that, but It is increasingly so. Re
ports now Indicate states regarded
certain to be republican are now
doubtful, and states that were doubt
ful now are in the democratic column.
"The repnblleana concede the peace
argument of the womevoters." Polls
show the percentage of Wilson sup
port among the women Is larger than
among the men, although among the
men it grows larger day by day.
"Labor Is practically a unit for Wil
son, and the Issues are such they can
not be driven away from him by their
employers. Business men appreciate
the value of the currency law, and
farmers recognise the administration
has done more for them than any be
fore It. I have found that the most
universally applauded act of the pre
sident has been his refusal to Inter
vene In Mexico."
SERBIANS 2 MILES
London, Oct. 20. In the face of
stubborn Bulgarian resistance, Ser
bian troops have pushed two miles
northward In their advance on the
Bulgarian base at Monastlr, occupy
ing the village ot Veleselo. It was
officially announced today.
The Forty-fourth and Twenty-
eighth Bulgarian regiments, the offi
cial Serbian statement declares, have
been defeated and four machine guns.
three Held guns and eighty prisoners
taken.
The Serbian claims of further suc
cesses are flatly contradicted by the
German war office this evening. The
Berlin official statement admitted that
the Serbs had made some gains, but
declared the new Serbian offensive
m the bend of the river Cerna has
been checked.
Because of the Serbian offensive
and the tense situation at Athens,
the Balkans held the center of the
wnr stage today. Fragmentary mes
sages from the Greek capital Indi
cated that the situation was again
more critical, despite severe military
measures reported yesterday.
On the western front heavy rains
continued to Impede operations
through yesterday and Inst night. The
