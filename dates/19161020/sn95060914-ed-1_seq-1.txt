TWENTY SECOND YEAR
REPUBLICAN RALLY
HELD ATSAFFORD
Camp and Party Tell the
PWpk what They Would
Do If Elected
THOHAS HAKES THE BIG TALK
He Would Have Acted Opposite
to What Gov Hunt Did In
the Clifton Strike
The republican candidates
headed by Tom Campbell blew
into town Sunday afternoon
coming here from Clifton where
they were marooned by the big
rain storm Friday
Monday night they appeared
in the Armory for the big talk
The Thatcher Band was in at
tendance to cheer them up with
Eatriotie airs and a large assem
lageof people was present to
listen to the arguments of the
different candidates in soliciting
the support of the people at the
coming general election
R J Young chairman of the
Republican County Committee
presided and introduced the can
didates
The State candidates present
weref Tom Campbell candidate
for governor Doane Merrill can
didate for auditor John L Gust
candidate for attorney general
H E Matthews candidate for
superintendent of public instruc
tion and Geo H Smalley can
didate for State tax commis
sioner
Doane Merrill led the speaking
by telling the story of By Smiths
boquet dance at Clifton which
he declared was a great success
H E Matthews who is well
known here having several years
ago held the position of principal
of the Thatcher schools made a
nicotalk on educational lines and
what he hoped to accomplish if
elected superintendent of public
instruction
Gso H Smalley was next in
order with the story of Dr R C
-Flowers big mining swindle
known as theSpenazuma Mine
John L Gust then came upon
the scene and told what he would
do if he was elected attorney
general
Next came the big event of the
evening Tom Compbell who
opened the ball by declaring that
The Guardian had prepared the
way for him in a list of questions
for him to answer
This was true en6ugh The
fact is the people want to know
what he would do if elected gov
ernor and we are still in the
dark as to just what he would do
in some matters that are of vital
importance in the administration
of the States affairs
In answer to the question
How he would cut down ex
penses and lower taxes he sug
gested that he would accomplish
this by recommending the budget
system which is a democratic
measure He declared there
were too many State employees
too many people holding minor
positions and suggested that the
number could be cut down and
each State official could borrow
the clerks of other officials to
help them out in their office
work A plan that would cer
tainly not be economical or satis
factory something that any busi
ness man could see would not
work out successfully in any
plans for accomplishing good
-work in any department
Mr Campbell acknowledged
that he was still on the pay roll
of the State drawing 25000 a
month and doing nothing for it
and had been out campaigning
for a new job while holding on
and drawing salary for the old
job He did not suggest that
this was not giving the people a
square deal but that he did it
because others did it and that if
he did not take the money he
was not earning he would
accused of being in the
of the corporations a very ridic
ulous answer to a question that
any eighth grade boy or girl
could answer
He further said he would in
vestigate all offices He did not
say how he would do it or what
would bo accomplished by such
taxpayer
investigation although it might him
be inferred that blate oilicers
like himself who were drawing
salary and doing nothing in re
turn for it might be made to
work honestly
In answer to the question
whether he would reduce the ex
GOV HUNTS PARTY
Will Address the People at
the Saf ford Armory
Saturday Night
Gov George W P Hunt and
party will be here tomorrow
Saturday and will address the
people at Safford Armory 800
oclock in the evening
Those accompanying Governor
Hunt are Carl Hayden candi
date for Congress Charles R
Howe candidate for Tax Com
missioner Sidney P Osborn
candidate for Secretary of State
and Wiley E Jones candidate
for Attorney General
The Safford Band will be in at
tendance during the evening and
furnish the music
Everybody in the Gila valley
is invited to attend this meeting
of the democratic candidates for
State offices and for Congress
penditure for education Mr
Campbell said he favored educa
tional institutions which is very
nice indeed His further ideas
on this question were expressed
in the statement that he agreed
with Candidate Matthews plan
for a better educational system
for the schools
Mr Campbell would not reduce
the expenditure for good roads
and in this he is democratic yet
we have no assurance of just
what he would do in the matter
that is not being done now
In regard to improving public
institutions he was not very
clear though he told a story of
what was doing at the Normal
in Flagstaff during the summer
months saying there were more
teachers than pupils He would
probably discharge the teachers
Mr Campbell was sure he
would cut off some of the com
missions How he would do this
he did not say and we would
like to know for the reason that
as governor he would n5t have
anything to do with the creation
or cutting off of commissions
the legislature attending to that
Eart of the program Mr Camp
ell was sure tho that he could
save the State 161000 which
would be very nice and very
clever and is good dope to spring
on thepeople when you are run
ning for office and undoubtedly
Tom had in mind that the 25000
per month that he has been draw
ingforseveral months while cam
paigning was included in the
16i000 he would save to the
State if the people would elect
him governor and anyone can
see how true this would be
Mr Campbell said he would
favor capital to come into the
State and get a square deal This
is truly democratic and agreeable
In regard to what he would
have done in the Clifton strike
Mr Campbell stated he would
have done just opposite to what
Governor Hunt did
We infer from this answer
that the National Guard would
be used to break the strike just
as it has always been used in re
publican states The miner in
Clifton Morenci and Metcalf
would still be drawing the wages
of a peon if he were alive and
these three camps would still be
what they were before the strike
the lowest wage mining camps
in the Southwest
Mr Campbell tried to show by
reading part of a speech delivered-
by Governor Hunt that
the governor had arrayed class
against class but failed utterly
The question could not be satis
factorily answered by a man who
declared he would do just oppo
site to what Governor Hunt did
in the Clifton strike There is
no question as to where Tom
Campbell stands in matters of
this kind
All through his speech Mr
Campbell was very solicitious
that The Guardian would get
him down right The frequent
exclamation Put that down
Jdhn helped the big fellow in
keeping the crowd good humored
who were rather dazed at times
over his six syllable vocabulary
i iiacu su tjiLtiiivtMV in liviiiu lu
he i show where he stood on matters
employ of vital interest to the voter and
Every republican present was
happy and the ladies of the same
laith were carried away
Eoliticai beauty of the republican
candidate for governor for Tom
was good to look at even tho we
knew we could not agree with
and that not withstanding
the admiration of the ladies
Tom will be so badly defeated
by Governor Hunt on November
7th that ho will go back to his
old job at Phoenix and we hope
try to earn tho salary of his of

GOT THIS OftE DOWN
Campbells Answer Shown
To Be Absolutely
Untrue
In his speech Saturday night
Tom Campbell in answer to the
question How would he cut
down expenses and lower taxes
declared that in the SCate peni
tentiary at Florence there is one
guard to every eight prisoners
This particular answer was an
enjoyable morsel to the republi
cans at this meeting especially
when Campbell shouted Get
that down John
It was put down alright and
the following telegram shows
how true Mr Campbells state
ment in regard to the employees
in the penitentiary Was and that
the rest of his answers were on
a -par with this one
tTTJtje telegram is as follows

Graham Guardian
battord Arizona
Mr Campbell is in error Bayinjr there
is now one guard to every eight pris
oners at this institution the average is
18 to 25 Drisoners to every cuard Dur
ing the last full fiscal years of repub
lican administration ending June SO
1911 guards wages shown by annual
report amounted to 3903307 with an
average of 35 guards for 445 prisoners
an average or 16 prisoners -to every
guard as compared with last fiscal year
of present administration ending June
30 J91G which wa3 2517943 for
guards wages for an average of 21
guards for 376 prisoners or eighteen
prisoners to every guard -
Cost of running this institution has
been substantially reduced in all de
partments during this administration
if compared with the reDublican Six
hundred or more prisoners can ber
guarded inside the walls here at the
same expense as 100 or less- hence the
number of prisoners has nothing to do
with the number of guards employed
The reduction in the guarding coat un
der the present administration is due
to the fact that the democrats upon
taking charge Here discharged all
deadheads politicians and hangerson
including ones that were practically
blind

SUPPORTS WILSON
Garfield Denounces Sectional
Issue Raised by the
Republicans
James R Garfield son of the
late ex president who seeks to
be Secretary of the Interior in
the event the republicans are
successful in the coming cam
paign is a great supporter of
Justice Hughes but his brother
H A Garfield who asks noth
ing at the hand of any political
party and who is therefore in a
position to unreservedly express
himself is a warm admirer and
supporter of President Wilson
J R Garfield recently made a
speaking tour through Arizona
for Hughes and the republicans
made much of the fact that the
son of the great president was
supporting that head of theje
publican ticket However they
did not state the President Gar
fields other son was an admirer
of Woodrow Wilson
In a recent letter to Senator
Burton Mr Garfield went on
record for President Wilson in
the following language
Dear Mr Burton May I
reply informally to your circular
letter of the 8th of September
in which you appeal to me not
as a partisan but as a college
man to enroll as a member of the
Hughes National College League
Highly as I honor Mr Hughes I
have decided to support Mr Wil
son His character as a man his
sympathetic understanding of the
problems of the day his record in
office his unusual ability pre
eminently displayed in meeting
and dealing with thethree great
emergencies of his administra
tionand the importance of main
taining an uninterrupted policy
at this juncture in world affairs
lead me to believe that the best
interests of our country will be
served in keeping the present
administration and its party in
office for the present I have
therefore enrolled myself with
the League of Independent vot
ers of MSssaclnsetts
Permit me to add that the
sectional issue raised by some
of our republican leaders is re
pugnant to the American spirit
and the welfare of our institu
tions Under the circumstances
it offends the sense of fair deal
ing with political opponents it
tends to arouse old hres of pas
sion and if successful will dis
unite a people now united and
incidentally destroy the party
that fosters so calamitous an
issue
Sincerely yours
H A Garfield

WILLIAM J OWEN
COMMITS SUICIDE
Former Business Man Ends
His Life on Train near
Pima Saturday Night
NO REASON KNOWN FOR ACT
t
Body Is Brought Here and
Funeral Services were Held
Monday Afternoon
The many friends here of W
J Owen were trreatlv shocked
Saturday night when they heard
the news that he had shot and
killed himself on the passenger
train for Globe while temporarily
insane
Mr Owens who had been
visiting here for several days the
past week decided Saturday to
return to his home in Miami He
got on the train at the depot and
his strange actions attracted the -attention
of the train crew He
stood on the platform of one of
the coaches for some time after
the train was in motion appear-
ing very nervous or worried
A brakeman named E K
Baker was standing in the rear
vestibule of the last car watch
ing him Finally Owens came
into the car and walked up and
down the aisle apparently un
able to remain in one place more
than a second or two
As the train left Central he
walked back to where Baker was
standing and then turned and
entered the mens toilet In a
short time a report of a pistol
shot rang out and Baker opened
the door of the toilet room and
found Owen lying on the floor in
a pool of blood
Believing that the man was
dead caKer caned the conduct
and advised that official to jock
the door This was done and it
was not until the train reached
Pima that it was discovered
Owen was still breathing Here
it was found that the self inflicted
wound had been committed with
a 32 Colts automatic revolver
the bullet entering the head
above the right ear ranged down
ward and came out on the left
side of the head just above the
left ear
Dr R C Dryden met the train
at Pima and took charge of the
dying man Nothing could be
done for him and he passed away
in about half an hour
Justice Holladay impannelled
a jury which viewed the body
Permission was given for the
removal of the body to Safford
by Undertaker M E O Bryan
and it was brought here about
1200 oclock Saturday night

age

Mr Owen sold his interest in the
business to Mr BrosheaVs
From here he went to Miami
and bought a half interest in the
Miami Bottling Works and about
four months ago he sold out his
interest to his partner
About a month ago he came
here and had a deal on for the
