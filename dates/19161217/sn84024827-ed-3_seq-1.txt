HEN Christmas time is pretty near, if
we're good girls and boys,
Our mothers take us up the street an' let lis
see the to vs.

Ad'we forget that it is cold an' that our clothes
is thin
An' think we're mighty lucky just to stand
there lookin' in. . '
If we could onlv have our wish I guess that
that we would pray
To have some angel come some night an' take
that glass away,
An' it would , pay the angel, too, to see the
mothers smile
If we could play with all those toys for just a
little while.
Some day when we are all grown up an' rich
as we can be,
If' Santa Claus would just bring things like
those in there to me
An' for awhile it seems almost as if he really
had,
An' then I 'member that he ain't, an', my, it
makes me sad!
Some day when we are all grown up an' rich
as we can be
We're goin' to buy a store like that, an' when
kids come to see
The things inside we'll let 'em in to help
themselves to toys.
An', my, we know what that will mean to lit
tle girls an' boys!
