FRIENDS OF CLERKS
WIN FIRST BATTU
By Vote of 263 to 77, Opei
Way to Make Increase
Larger.
DEFEAT FITZGERALD RULE
The first round in the fight to in
crease the salaries of governmen
clerks was fought late yesterday after
noon in the House, the victory beinj
a heavy one in favor of the member
who want a more liberal raise than th
& ana 10 scale offered by th
appropriations committee in section si:
of the legislative, executive and judi
cial appropriation bill. Hy a vote o
2C3 to 77 the Hous * overthrew th
proposed air-tight rule of the appro
priations committee and adopted a rui
brought in by the rules committer
which, in effect, paves the way for lib
oral amendments, greater increases am
unlimited debate.
The whole government clerk salary mat
ter is now wide open, with the probabilit;
* that tomorrow the House will have :
chance to add the Nolan $3-a-day bil
as an amendment and that Represent
ative Keating of Ccdorado will offer a
a further arrfbndment his proposal fo
a sliding scale increase of generou
proportions for all employes above th
$1,080 grade.
The battle yesterday was a short one
a little more than half an hour beini
consumed in talk. For once the en
tire rules committee, republicans am
democrats, turned up as a unit and reported
a rule which would allow grea
freedom of action.
Labor Leaders Were Active.
The necessity for a rule has beei
discussed previously. By this rule thsalary-raising
proviso may be retaine<
in the bill and not be knocked out on ;
point of order. The proposed Fitzger
aid rule went a step farther and pre
vented any amendment to the 5 and l1
per cent raise. Had the Fitzgerald rub
been adopted the House would simply
take section six or leave it.
Labor leaders were active all da:
yesterday while the rule which even
tually carried the day was irameci
They were especially interested in see
ing that the Nolan bill?the three-do|
lar-a-day minimum wage bill?is tack
ed on to the appropriation bill; and nov
that the House has bowled over th'
appropriations committee, the Xolai
bill seepis to be the next step. Unde
Its provisions no employe of the government
who has been at work for th<
government a year and is twenty-on<
years of age, shall receive less than $:
a day.
Representative Fitzgerald of New York
chairman of the appropriations comr
mittee. wearing the reddist necktie evei
seen in Congress perhaps, appeared to b<
afire with rage when Chairman Henrj
of the rules committee arose and presented
the resolution containing the ruk
to change the legislative program in hand
Mr. Fitzgerald Makes Fight.
Representative -Fitzgerald declared th<
House had never before seen the chairmai
of one committee take command of th<
situation which had been given to anothei
committee; that the rules committee ha<
no right to step in and muddy up th<
waters; that the appropriation bill is s
matter for the appropriations committe<
to steer, and that the rules committer
would better get out.
Then Chairman Henry, in five minutes
dug up political history of the last tei
years. He dragged into his counter
charge the old Cannon rules fight and th<
Fitzgerald embargo bills. He talked abcu
cotton, war. appropriations and politics
and got more into a five-minute speed
than most men can learn in a lifetime.
Between retorts Representative Mam
of Illinois asked a simple question whicl
may indicate that some one on the re
rtnhlieart aide will attcmnt to mako thi
propose<1 clerks' salary increases effective
before July 1. 1917, as provided now.
Representative Fitzgerald explainer
that the appropriations committee hn<
to find a policy of salary raising tha
would be followed by all committees, am
that in addition the country is facing ;
deficit of $254,000,000; that some of thi
appropriations to be placed before th
House would Increase the governmen
burden of expense a hundred million :
year without increasing the returns o
service. He charged the rulew committee
with an entire lack of responsi
bflity.
Republicans Support Mr. Henry.
Representative Lenroot of Wisconsir
and Representative Campbell of Kansas
republican members of the rhles corn
rnittee. defended the Henry rule, declar
Ing it a liberal and proper one.
It will give members a chance t
express their opinion on the subjec
of salary raises," said Kepresentativ
Lenroot.
Representative Cannon of Illinois wa
opposed to the Henry rule and defend
ed the Fitzgerald proposition and th
appropriations committee. Representa
live Mann urged the republicans t
vote for the Henry rule, and the ensu
lng vote showed they took his advic
in large numbers.
The merits of the salary questioi
were not touched upon, the first figh
imply being a skirmish to get pre
ferred position on-kfye matter of amend
ing the present for and 1
per cent raises ear only. < >;
the rising vote Henry rule wa
adopted. 190 to 4 9. arid the record rol
calij, vole showed 203 to 77.
Previous to this skirmish Rep.e
syntative Borland endeavored to in
, ?ert his eight-hour proviso into th
bill extending the work day of gov
-rnment clerks in Washington to
length of eight hours. He received bu
little support.

EXPECTS "DRY" D. C.
: VOTE TOMORROW
i Senator Sheppard Confident
Action Will Be Taken Before
Day Is Over.
i
I BILL ATTACKED SHARPLY
A vote in the Senate on the District
t prohibition bill before adjournment to
morrow was confidently predicted by
? Senator Sheppard after the Senate ads
Journed last evening1.
e Consideration of the measure in the
e Senate had reached the point where a
K ! vote was about to be taken on the
" ! Smoot substitute for the Sheppard bill.
j Senator Underwood, calling attention to
e the fact that many of the senators had
" left the chamber with the understande
ing there would be no vote before Mone
day, asked Senator Sheppard to lay the
bill aside. Senator Sheppard said that
^ he would not force a vote at that time,
but added that he would move an ad"
journment so that the prohibition bill
would retain its place as the unfinished
1 business of the Senat >.
1 Unless an active filibuster against the
_ bill should develop tomorrow, the
s chances for actiop on the measure apr
pear good. The first vote is expected
s on the Smoot substitute, which is a
e more drastic measure than the Sheppard
bill. Following that will come
the vote on the Underwood referendum
y amendment, to which Senator Kern has
. offered an amendment permitting the
j women of the District to vote as well
_ as the men.
Senator Martine Attacks Bill.
, The Sheppard bill was the subject of
vigorous attacks yesterday afternoon
1 by Senator Martine and Senator Reed.
e The dry bill was in danger of being
i sidetracked temporarily when at 2
l o'clock the volunteer officers' pension
bill came up automatically as the un"
finished business of the Senate, having
- I displaced the Sheppard bill Friday aft0
j ernoon. when Senator Sheppard asked
e i to have that bilU laid aside tempo
f- rarily.
By a vote of 34 to 33 a motion by
y Senator Sheppard to take up the dry
_ bill was carried. Many of the senaI.
tors who voted against the Sheppard
_ motion announced that they did so not
_ because they were opposed to that bill,
1 but because they desired to see the
v volunteer officers* bill passed. This bill,
e championed particularly by Senator
:i Townsend of Michigan, has the supr
port of practically all of the senators
_ except a handful from the south, who !
B have consistently opposed its considB
eration.
3 i "I am unalterably opposed to both
the Smoot and Sheppard bills," said
Senator Martine of New Jersey. "I
' have no doubt that the committee rer
porting the Sheppard bill was prompt?
ed by honest and conscientious motives,
but at the same time I feel and know
that our asylums ?re filled with men
, who are prompted by honest and conscientious
convictiops."
The senators and galleries laughed at
this hit by the New Jersey senator.
He continued: "J feel that this com?
mittee, in its zeal, is possessed of hal'
lucinations that make them well nigh
mad."
r Refers to Frances E. Willard.
1 Senator Martine recalled the words of
e Frances E. Willard. who urged that it
1 first be made easier for mankind to
? get bread and butter, and that then the
" theory of temperance would fall on
more fertile fields.
"We are legislating for humanity,"
said Senator Martine. "But humanity
" in the District of Columbia has not
r asked you for this legislation. I have
heard ro cry from humanity or the
people of the District for your drastic
un-American proposition.
"Experience has shown such legislaj
tion to be a failure. Alcoholic liquors!
nave neen usea oy tne numan rac?
since the days of Adarn. and I believe |
e j they will continue to he so used till!
e ' the end of time. You cannot make men '
, i over in a day. nor change the tastes'
' and appetites of a people by law. Your
* ! measure will tend to make liars arid j
r, hypocrites o{ men."
Senator Martine quoted Arthur Brisbane
1 to the effect that there is more drunkene
ness in Maine with its prohibition law
e and 1,300.000 population than in Italy
1 with its more than 13.000.000 population
\ and no prohibition law. Referring to tne
1 original plan to make particular exemption
of the foreign embassies and lega
tions here so far as the importation of
liquor was concerned. Senator Martine
said that the legations would have been
* "the most popular irrigating points in the
District."
i "This hill will make us ridiculous in the
i, eyes of the world." he said.
Senator Beed Opposes Measure.
Senator Reed said that#inder the Shep0
pard bill a manufacturer could make a
: million of gallons of alcohol and export it,
e the only limitation being that the purp
chaser did not intend to use it for beverage
purposes. It could, however, be com~
pounded with other ingredients and sold
as a beverage, he argued. He scouted ti.e
" i explanation that the alcohol is made in
| the District as a by-product of one established
business. He said:
e "Why should the District be the habitat
of an industry making this dreadful poin
son?" He rejected the plea that it should
1 j 1/e maintained because it is an established
" business, claiming that saloon keepers
- i and whiskey dealers also have an estab(>
I lishefl business. ^
r: I "I don't understand the logic which pro*
' proses to perpetuate the primal source of
!' I this evil and then undertakes to stnr. tJ.r.
] fvil further along." said Senator Herd.
- i Senator Reed also assailed the Shep
| pard bill because it placed a limit on
e the amount of wine which ministers
- j may import for sacramental purposes,
a j If the ministers cannot be trusted, he
t; said, then it was useless to enact this
j prohibitory legislation.
Provision to Close Offending Clubs.
j Senator Curtis offered and had ac7
j cepted by Senator Smoot an amendment
| to the Smoot substitute bill which pro
vides that all houses, clubs, etc., where
j alcoholic liquors are made or sold or
j } dispensed in any way contrary to the
law shall be held common nuisances
and may be closed up.
Senator Gronna announced that, while
he was heartily in favor of prohibition,
he would support the Sheppard bill in
j preference to the more drastic Smoot
j bill because he thought it had a better
~ j chance of becoming a law.
" | Senator Thompson introduced an
1 | amendment to the Sheppard bill which
s ; would make it a crime for any one to
! give intoxicating liquors to any minor^
* j except the parenth or guardian of the"
! child or a physician,
s j He also offered an amendment to the
j Underwood referendum amendment
j providing that in the event a refer~
j endum election is had the bars and ?a
{ loons in the District shall be closed on
r j election day.

11$ IT TREASON
TO FIGHT DEFENSE
| Former Secretary Garrison
Talks on Nationalism Before
Lawyers' Club.
I -
SEES DANGER IN PACIFISM
By tlie Associated Tress.
NEW YORK, December 16.?To question
the power and imperative necessity
of the national government to
preparation for defense, "is
fittle short of treason," it was declared
here today by former Secretary
of War Lindlev M. Garrison, in an address
on "Nationalism" before the Lawyers'
Club. After reviewing the passing
of many powers and duties from the
state government^ to the national government.
he said that in the matter
of preparedness the central government
"flinched and faltered and sought
to pass its neglected duty to the
states," the result being "a lamentable
failure."
"From the viewpoint of the national
entity," Mr. Garrison said, "nationalism
is the possession of and the exercise*
by the national government of every
power and function necessary to perform
properly the collective duties and
to fulfill completely the collective obli
j gallons or tne nation. from me viewi
point of the citizen, nationalism is the
J yielding-, not in theory, but in prac|
tice. of his mind, his heart and his %
spirit to the welfare* of the nation,
the contribution of his material means
and his physical force to its preservation
and defense. It means service and
sacrifice, devotion and loyalty."
One of the most dangerous sentiments
threatening the integrity of the
nation, he said, is that which "utilizes
the natural and universal abhorrence
of war as a reason for not preparing
for its possibilities." .
Defense Nation's Cardinal Duty.
"Self-defense is the cardinal duty of
a nation," he said. "The national government
is the only agency that can
make proper preparation. To deny its
power or to question the imperative
necessity of its exercising that power
is little short of treason. C
"This is a duty which the national .
government has neglected. Ia this par- \
ticular the modern tendency has been
reversed. The national government
j flinched and faltered and sought to
pass its neglected duty to the states.
I The result was bound to be a lamentai
ble failure."
j Mr. Garrison went on to speak for
j the avoidance by the United States of
European entanglements, saying that
I any proposition which requires this ^
i country to enter' an alliance with the w
other naftions of the world "and to engage
to join with those who side with
the belligerent found to be righteous
against the belligerent found to be
wrongful should be tested in the fiery
furnace of fierce debate and discussion
before it should be acted upon." If
the United States, he said, engaged,
as has been suggested, in a universal
alliance, "she is, perforce, a party to K
every quarrel the wide world over. No $
acceptable reason occurs to me which ..
warrants or justifies the United States 11
in becoming by its own voluntary act d
a party to all the quarrels of all the j.
| nations of the earth." ^

TO SAFEGUARD RIGHTS
lecretary Baker Discusses Preparedness
Before American Academy of
Political and Social Science.
\y the Associated Prens.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., December 16.?
Teuton D. Baker, Secretary of War, adresslng
the American Academy of Poitical
and Social Science here tonight,
eclared that America has learned from
Europe that war is a new thing and that
his country by experience has learned
hat it may fcet into it. He spoke on
The Real Significance of Preparedess."
Declaring that the United States by
reparing against the invasion of its
ights by taking the proper precau- j
ions to safeguard those rights had no j
lea of aggressiveness, Mr. Baker said I
hat this country has grown more ideal
i its attitude toward other nations.
If the great test and sacrifice should
ome to us we should find ourselves
dequately prepared," he said. "Alhough
America is for peace there are
ome prices that are too high."
A part of the program of real pre- I
aredness, he said, must be the elimi- j
ation of huge war profits, "whiefaj
empt the manufacturers of munitions I
o want war rather than peace.'*
Present Army Merely Police Force, j
"Preparedness comes to us as the re- i
ult of what is going on in Europe,"
ontinued Mr. Baker. "Our standing i
rmy is in the nature of a small police j
orce and . is inconsistent with the \
teady growth of population in the |
Jnited States.
"We have realized by the European
irar that modern war is different from
ny kind of war which we have ever
hought about or participated' in beause
of the intricate agencies emloyed
in present-day warfare.
"Preparedness includes a better coordination
of industries of the nation,
he development of a spiritual attitude
nd a complete change in economic aad
oclal life.
""We've learned the necessity of miliary
training; the modern war involves
normousiy larger forces in proportion
o the population; that it means a comilete
abstraction of men of all classes
rom occupations and business.
\
Industrial Mobilization Necessary.
"We've learned that much depends on
he success with which the population
an be mobilized industrially to support
the life of the nation and its arnies.
"Business men in case of war should
>e ready and willing to manufacture
lauunui securities. we nave created
l set of dependencies making us detend
on one another, and this has led
o progressivlsm in politics, which
neans science, knowledge and better
neans of communication which we caniot
allow any person or group of perons
to control."
Mr. Baker expressed the hope that
ome day the world would put aside
'the abomination of war."

BELGIAN DEPORTATIONS
MAY BE QUIETLY ENDED
HHcials Here Carefully Watching
tits Cfcugod German Policy at
Result of Protests.
. v-i *>*!?
While the diplomatic controversy
vith Germany over Belgian deportaions
temporarily is in abeyance, offlials
are watching carefully for any inlication
of a softening of the German
ittitude as a result of the protests of
he United States, Spain, Holland,
Iwitzerland and the Vatican. It would j
ccasion no surprise here if the German !
olicy were quietly modified, despite j
he government's declaration that the 1
neasures taken were necessary and in
.ccordance with international law.
Determined by Public Opinion.
It has been indicated that this gov- !
rnment's course would be determined !
>y public opinion as it crystallizes, but
here are indications that should the j
iractlces complained of be discontin- j
led. the American protest would not be >
iressed further. Officials think that j
f a discontinuance were decided upon j
he decision would be put into effect j
uietly, and probably would not be acompanied
by a public announcement
r any diplomatic assurances that
light seem to represent a recession
rom the stand Germany already has
penly taken.
Should the State Department's inforlation
during the next few weeks inicate,
however, that the deportations
re continuing unchecked, it is not unIkely
that some further step might be
ecided upon to emphasize the Amerian
protest. Officials are understood
o have been much impressed by such
*-pressfons of approval for their stand
s were voiced at the protest meeting
'riday night in New York and by many
lessages of commendation that have
eached the White House and the State
iepartment.
Further Action Undecided.
Just what further action the United
Itates could take, however, is probematical.
In some quarters it has been
uggested that the department's inforlation
regarding conditions in Belgium,
aid to be at variance with statements
n the German reply to the American
rotest, be made public. It is realized,
towever, that such a step might lead
o a fruitless and perhaps embarrassing
ontroversy over facts.
There also have been suggestions
hat an effort he made for joint action
vith other neutrals to mobilize world
pinion in protest against the German
olicy, but from the beginning of the
irar the United States has studiously
efrained as a matter of principle from
oining in any concerted diplomatic
epresentatlons.

STATE SOCIALISM DANGEF
By the Associated Press.
CHICAGO, December 16.?Frank A
Vanderlip, president t)f the Nationa
City Bank of New York, addressing th
Chicago Bankers' Club tonight, warne
his auditors that the United State
\? in nave meet economic ana aocia
problems as a result of the Europea
war that will tax the ingenuity an
resourcefulness of the nation, an
called upon bankers to study and pre
pare to. aid in the solution of thes
problems.
The belief that the United State
could proceed along its own way se
rene. unaffected by the war and seek
ing only to keep out of it, he declare*
seemed a lack of imagination, blind
ness of vision and a complete failur
to understand the unity of the indus
trial, commercial and financial world.
"Unless I utterly misjudge affairs,
he said, "there are going to develo
for this country problems of the grav
est import?problems that will need fo
their correct solution the attention c
the most enlightened minds.
Danger From State Socialism.
"State socialism in Europe may d
velop problems the like of which ne\
er concerned our minds. We ma
have to meet collective buying, state
aided industries, forms of govern
mental co-operation with busines
auite outside our range of though
Government control of ocean-born
commerce and novel factors in inter
national finance will be subjects fo
national consideration. There ma
come out of the war changes in form
of government that will have profoun
and worldwide influence."
Mr. Vanderlip reviewed the results o
the war in the United States up to th
present, the increase in gold supplies
the development of credits. He" discuss
ed national legislation, with praise fo
the federal reserve act and the federa
trade commission.
Says Bankers Share Blame.
Mentioning the federal farm loai
board, he said:
"Does not the objection to the prin
ciple involved, when governmental re
lations are injected into business, li
quite as much with bankers as wit
the legislators? Will we not alway
find the people groping to do throug
governmental agencies things thfct ai
left undone or are badly done by it
dividual initiative? Must we not sa.fi
guard the future from an unwise parti
cip alien of government busineis b
seeing that business is so well cor
ducted, so fairly administered, so conn
pletely responsive to legitimate need
that there will be no sound reason fo
government participation.
"Within a w?e? I heard the repte
sentatlve of four great railway union
state his views before a New Yorl
club. To my mind they were views tha
contained the essence of anarchy. "VV
were told that we must not pass cer
:ain laws because they would not b
obeyed. We were given ciear intima
tions regarding the power of thes
of organized labor, but they certainl
hint of their duty or responsibility t
society.
"I am hopeful that such utterance
do not voice truly the attitude of th
people of America nor of any great par
of organized labor, but they certainly;
emphasize the need for a nations
iwakenlng to the need for souni
thinking on economic problems."

I of Enemy Surmounted
by French in Assault
From Staff Correspondent of the Associated
3 ' Press.
PEPPER HILL. Verdun Front. Saturday,
December 16, via Chantilly.-?
Snow and sleet fell throughout last v
evening, rendering difficult further operations.
The French staff's examination
of the German positions captured
demonstrates their formidable nature
~ and their high state of preparedness
s against assault.
r Thirty German deserters, who came
in before the battle began, testify that
the crown prince's army had knowledge
f that an attack was about to be made
n and were confident that they could hold
. the ground, which, during their nine
months of occupation, they had stronge
ly organized. They assert that more
I Germans were desirous of deserting,
s I but that the strictest precautions,
^ I which had been taken, and the nature
of the ground prevented them from dof
ing so.
e
Difficulties Encountered.
p The difficulties opposed to the French
- advance may be. realized from the altitude
of the hills which the troops were
J ordered to take and succeeded in capi
turing. Pepper Hill, which is double
a crested, is 1,122 feet high; Louvemont
' is 1,138 feet high, and another hill, uns
named, behind, is 1,180 feet. The work
- of the French aviators, like that of the
1 infantrymen and artillerymen, was carried
out everywhere with almost indo- f
scribable daring- Dozens of squadrillas
of airmen flitted about observing: and
correcting- the artillery Are and accom- '
panying the infantry formations in
s their advance, after which they flew
t rapidly back to headquarters with de1
tailed reports, thus keeping the commander-in-chief
in closest touch with

Disorder Among Gunners. \
1 The clearness of the atmosphere asf
sisted the men greatly, while the at
tempts of the German artillery fire to
1 bring them down wei/ generally abortive,
owing to the disorder among
the gunners brought about by the
quickness of the French advances.
During the entire day not a French \
airman was killed. On the other hand* V
I it is reported that they destroyed a? \
German observation balloon, which \
probably accounts for a terrific burst I
