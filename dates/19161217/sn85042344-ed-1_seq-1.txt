Inc peace negotiations uses more
dignified, nnd direct methods. She
does not advertise her intentions thru-
out the world hefore her proposals
have even heon transmitted to the
iirtwoi's concerned.
'The Centum declaration has the
rlnracter of a sensational act of pill
liclly calculated to prepossess tho

not merit serious consideration. What

hv her nnd in accordance with the
very idens which the allies nre fik'ht
InK to destroy ideas of (Ierman

"Uussia cannot speak of peace w ith

himself the victor. The rejection of
(Scrniany's proposal In no sense places
Kussiu in the position of a nation not
desirous of a durahle peace or In-
seiuililo to t no urRont necosity or
re.-cuim: Kuropo from the calamity
which hns cast its shadow over the
entire world. Hut Itussla will , con
tinue to suffer this ealanii'y and add
Indefinitely to tlio sacrifices which
she has already made rather than suh
mit to the greater cntstroplie threat
ened hy (ierman Imperial munitions.
"What Russia wants In common
