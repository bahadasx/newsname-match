travelled in a special car. Carriages and taxi* resurrected from
the pasl me1 14s .it the station and conducted us t?> expensive
hotels. Br?dal suites frequently wen* given to th?' women. A
meal without champagne was a failure, ami the whole town was
expected to gr?e! us on our arrivai.
The momenl ni desce?? on a new city was thrilling. As
the tratn drew into the station, lined up on 'it?' platform would
be a group of prominenl citizens, retired generals, covered with
gold braid am! medals : wealt hj merchant . I he burgomaster and
ober-burgoma8ter ami other city officials, while the populace
crowded in the background. At such moments I descended from
tin1 train as graciously as Itcould and extended my hand. Often
I had it kissed. We press people ?soon fell we were doing duty
for the ?Kaiser.
Our luncheon in ?Karlsruhe was given by the Chamber of
Commerce. After two hours "t champagne ami bmokes for the
