Lov, I link for first; btxaus I believe that
is the most essential gift. I.ove for my fellow
man. ho that I may forgive bin in. understand
and sympathize with his narrows, and help him
as best I can. Love that wljl make me overlook
the little faults of others and help me to see,
instead, their sterling qualities. Love that will
make me big enough and strong enough to deny
myself some little pleasure, so that others may
be happy. Love that will make me appreciate
and honor now those who nre dear to me, be
fore they have puuid into that aftar-wor!d to
which we may send no messajrs.
And, dear Saint, with this gift of love,
leave a large supply of courage. Courage to go
on with my work, t-ourage to carry out my own
ideas and theories' of life regardless of public
sentiment. Courage to do always the thing I
believe is right. Courage to stand up against all
the world in defense of my ideals.
Lastly, do not forget to leave a package of
good cheer. Good cheer, to that when sorrows
come I may know that "there is a divinity that
shapes our ends,' and that some day all will
be right; Good clreer; w that when worriet
come, when work ia hard and money scarre,
and bills lire many, I'may be able to smile and
"fight a good fight." ' Good cheer, so that when
others are grouchy and the weather is dreary,
I may be able to bring some gladness into their
gloomy day.
These gifts I ask, Santa Claus; and, be
cause you have never failed me in the past, I
will expect you this Christmas Eve. I will have
the chambers of my heart swept clean of un
happy thoughts, worries, hates, jealousies, and
selfishness, in honor of your coming.

ATTRACTION OF UNUSUAL EX.
CELLENCY APPEARS AT
COLUMBUS THEATRE.
One of the best attractions that
ever visited this city was seen here
Thursday night, when May Irwin
and an excellent supporting company
presented LeKoy Scott's scintilating
comedy, "33 Washington Square," at
the Columbus Theatre.
miss irwin has lor many years
been recognized as one of America's
most talentcl comediennes, while the
supporting company in an unusually
meritoriui one and the play a bright,
spaikling comedy, with an ingenious
plot and many exceedingly novel sit
uations. It tells the story of Mrs.
DePuyster, a society woman, who, be
ing prevented by lack of funds from
making a contemplated trip to
Europe, decides to remain secretely
at her home in New York, her de
parture, in the meantime, having
been announced in the 'newspapers
Miss Frances Gaunt appears as Mrs.
DePuyster, while Miss Irwin, who is
seen as Matilda, her maid, is the only
one let in on the secret, and the at
tempt which she makes to conceal
her mistress developos many laugh
able complications.

ines,; to serve in any way possible
toward bringing the warring nations
tope i her.
The course to be pursued wa.
mad, known last night after the
president had conferred with Sh-it-tary
Lansing and after a prolonged
cabinet meeting. It was stated that
tho dtlay in forwarding the notes to
the entente capitals was due to the
fad that the messages received from
Germany, AusUia-llungary and Tur
key, identical in substance, differed
?lrrhtly in phraseology as a result of
different translations. They probab
ly will be put on the cables tomorrow.
Since the first note arrived, the
one from Germany, the president and
his closest . advisers have been ab
sorbed in a study of the situation
created.
The Austrian note followed and
the one from Turkey came late yes
teiday, too late to b translated for
tho- cabinet meeting. Those from
Germany and Au-Htiia have been gohe
over carefully by the president Bnd
Sccrc'ary Lnnuing to make certain
of th)ir meaning so that they may
ho sure to properly represent the in
tent of the contr.J powers.
The fact that tiic t'a'i t r eeling
lasted mnii ihan three hours and
wa.-i the most prolonged of the year
attracted profound attention in of
ficial circles and led to all sorts of
speculation. It was explained au
thoritatively later, however, that the
meeting was devoted largely to con
sideration of departmental matters
and hail been prolonged because it
vnr. the first time since the campaign
that all the members had been pres
ent. In other iiuarlers than the While
liouso it was learned that some word
indicating the official attitude of the
entente allies toward the peace pro
posal is being awaited with the deep
est interest by the American govern
ment. The president will not "consid
er injecting the United States into
the situation until he is thoroughly
fansiliar with all its phases.
Secretary Lansing, explaining the
delay in transmitting the communica
tions of the central powers, pointed
out that the German note was trans
lated into F.nglish by Charge (irew at
Bprlin and the one from Austria by
Ambassador Penfield at Vienna,
while the Tuikish note came to the
state department in French. As the
communications were intended to be
identical, the state department does
not desire to transmit three different
versions and when all three are in
hand a plan to aoid this will be de
termined upon. .
In I'.ngland. France and Japan this
government J epr.': ents all three Ten
tonic countries and will, therefore,
have t.j deliver three separate notes.
In Russia- and Servia the United
States represents both Austria and
Germany ar.d will have to fend only
two separate notes. Only to Bel
gium, where Austria is represented
and in Rumania, where Uermany is
represented, will it be possible to
send only one note.
there are several othr unique char
acters, prominent among Ihem being
Dr. Pyeoroft, a crook masquerading
as a clergyman, which is portrayeu
with fascinating finesse by Donald
Meek, while George Clark as Jack
DePuyster and AMnch bowker m
William, the butler, also deserve
praise for their work.
The scenic investure was all that
could be desired, and the production,
in its entirety, was a most excellent
one.

IS SOON TO BE SECURED
DIRECTORS OF ORGANIZATION
NOW MAKING SEARCH Fut
COMPETENT MAN.
Mr. S. B. Street, Jr., prtAlent of
the Chamber of Commerce, states .
that directors of that organization
are now engaged in making dilligent
search for a secretary, and that just
as soon as a competent tnan is found
the place will be filled.
The organization has been without
a secretary ever since Mr. J. G.
Weatherly tendered his resignation
several months ago, ana the delay in
filling the vacancy is attributable to
the fact that the directors have so
far been unable to get in touch with
a satisfactory man. It js a position
that requires not only good native
fcbility hut special training as well,
and the directors, realising this fact,
have decided to go slowly in the mat
ter, and will not enter into a contract
with any man unless reasonably sure
that he can "deliver the goods."
An important nutter which must
soon come up for consideration is
the' tefinar.cing of the organization.
The Civic Chamber has a large num
ber of members, and if all paid their
dues promptly the revenue would be
arnp!y sufficient to meet current ex
penses. Many of them have fallen
behind, however, and the inaugura
tion of a campaign for additional
funds must therefore soon be un
dertaken. Just at present people are so thor
oughly imbued with the Christmas
spirit that they have little time to
devote to civic matters, but with the
coming of the New Year the direc
tors intend to get busy, and the Civic
Chamber muv be expected to soon re-
