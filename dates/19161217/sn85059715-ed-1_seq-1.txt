PEPPER HILL. Verdun Front,
Friday Dec. 15. via Chantilly, Dec.
16?A short, sharp battle brought to
the French today their third smashing
victory within a period of two
months in the vicinity of Verdun. Every
objective point of the French
commanders was obtained with
chronoraetric accuracy.
\ Although the Germans offered a
desperate defense, they were like soft
clay in the hands of French troops,
who squeezed them into any shape
they liked and only ceased to handle
them when their own time came.
Thousands of Prisoners.
Thousands of German prisoners
poured into the French lines during
the day, including 200 officers and
large groups are still arriving. The
total count already is 7,500. (The
latest French official statement says
the number of prisoners exceeds
0,000). One division alone captured
more than 1,200 Germans within an
hour. More than eighty large and
small German cannon were captured
or destroyed and many others are
known to be buried.
The villages of Vacherauville,
L.ouivmont and Besonvaux and Hardailmont
wood now are in French
hands.
Great Fi-ench Advance.
The front over which the offensive
was executed was flffit'ki 1 cmretsr?"3ong.
When the fighting ceased, owing to
aarKness, the -bTencn advance naa exceeded
an average of three kilometers

of the Allied nations when he
speaks on the subject, probably next
week, in parliament.
Three Versions.
The three versions of the proposal,
differing slightly because of the
translations made in Berlin, Vienna,
and Constantinople were harmonized
into one official American translation,
a single copy of which was sent to
each of the American ambassadors
and ministers in the seven belligerent
countries where the United States
represents German. Austrian or Turkish
diplomatic interests. The actual
official texts probably will be forwarded
later in order to preclude any
ohanee of error or misinterpretation.
Whether any suggestion or offer to
mediate will be made by this government
until it Is indicated unmistakably
that such action would be welcomed
by.both sides remains undetermined
but President Wilson is known
to be anxious that the United States
shall not Impair its usefulness as a
mediator by premature action.
Hint to Belligerents.
The two day delay, while a uniform
translation of the peace notes was being
prepared here may. in the belief
of some diplomatists, constitute in
itself a hint to the belligerents of the
weight that is attached by American
officials to any peace proposals. In

that the delay may have had the effect
of preventing a hasty or premature
expression by the Allied nations.
There has been no suggestion, however,
that either of these considerations
were factors in delaying transmission
of the communications.
Russia is Keystone.
The unanimous declaration of the
Russian Duma against the peace proposal
aroused great interest here,
particularly in view of the many rumors
during the last few months
hinting at "a possible separate peace
for. Russia. The Russian empire has
been regarded in some quarters as the
keystone in the' peace situation and
Information as to the diplomatic
struggle in progress there Is meager.
