Germans Will State Terms.
By United Press
r WASHINGTON, Dec. 16. Germany
stands ready to give the Allies a full
statement of terms In a peace confer
ence This statement was made of
ficially today by the German Ambassa
dor after a short conference with Sec
retary of State Lansing.
Count von Bernstorff said he did not
know officially what these terms were.
At the same 'time Germany also is
ready to discuss disannamnt, crea
tion of a league to guarantee peace,
and kindred subjects that would nat
urally arise from peace negotiations.
The envoy's visit to the State De
partment was brief. "While von Bern
storff refused to talk about this Gov
ernment's plaa. It Is known that-German
authorities are not discouraged In
aay way by the fact that America will
not nrge any suggestions. On the con
trary they believe President Wilson
las "left a way open to act later,"
and hence apparently are encouraged
&x this fact.
President Wilson believes the door
h closing upon the great European
War, and that before longjthe time
will come for the friendly services of
tie neutrals. But he Is convinced that
the immediate present Is not the op
portune time for the United States to
extend any mediation offer. Hence,
he Is awaiting developments which
will follow the receipt of all'the Cen
tral Powers' peace proposals by the
enemy. He Is giving a tremendous
amount of study to all angles of the
Mtnation.
He is especially Interested

forces from some of their most ad

trict, said the officiareport today.

gone into prepared second line de

Constantlne Replies to Allies
By United Press
LONDON, Dec 16. First evidence
of new blood being Injected into the
British and French is seen in the re
organization of the cabinets of these
two nations and the new French of
fensive at Verdun.
The press reports of King Con-
stantlne's reply to the demands of the
Allies were received here today. As
the earlierIndications pointed to the
submission of Greece, the acceptance
of the Allies' terms will undoubtedly
reflect credit on Premiers Lloyd
George and Briand.
The action of the Russian duma in
rejecting the German peace proposal
and the French minister's speech were
received with strong approval in Lon
don. Following as does the speech of
Briand before the Chamber of Depu
ties and the tentative declaration of
Bonar Law in the House of Commons
Thursday, the action of Russia Is tak
en aa showing- the complete unity of
the Allies. It is considered certain
that the speech of Lloyd-George next
Tuesday will be along the same lines.
The only question is whether the
answer of the Allies to Germany will
be a flat rejection or a rejection
coupled with counter-suggestions.

Tree This Year.
OLD CLOTHES GIVEN
Mothers' Clubs Believe That
Co-operation Would Lead
to Better Relief.
Columbia kiddles from the more
needy families will have to go without
their big municipal Christmas tree this
year. The Elks Club has decided that
the youngsters who have been filled
with Christmas joy in former years
by the organization should be filled
with goodsubstantial food this sea
son. More than $100 which would have
been spent on a glittering tree in the
courthouse yard will be added to the
Elks' fund for the distribution of
staple food articles, clothing "and fuel
In the needy homes of Columbia
Christmas Day. The unusual condi
tions caused by the high prices and
the consequent desUtute condition ot
several families prompted the action
ot the club.
The committee composed of Kirk
Hayes, W. W. Garth and Lakenan
Price has arranged for the collection
of funds from the club members. The
funds will care for from twenty to
thirty families. The organization will
co-operate with the-other charitable
organizations in Columbia and get
the names of the more needy, so that
its work will not conflict with that of
these associations and clubs.
The baskets to be distributed will
contain such articles as a small sack
of flour, a sack of meal, lard, sugar,
potatoes, fruit, canned goods and
sweets for the children. Old clothes
will be collected for distribution, and
a fund will be reserved for fuel for
those In extreme need.
"I am glad to see the organization
&?flg such practical work' tK Christ
mas," said IL A. Collier, formerly a
member ot the committee. "Three
years ago We were confronted with a
similar situation. The Christmas tree
idea was abandoned, and about two
hundred Elks scoured the woods for
rabbits. Christmas Day those who did
not take part in the chase, being on
unfriendly terms with a shotgun, dis
tributed 300 rabbits among Colum
bia's poor and had fifty left over.
"It Is too bad that the kiddies can't
have their Christmas fun around the
big tree, but good, substantial food and
clothing will be better for them this
year."
Mr. Price indorses the new program
of the Elks as "getting down to the
bed-rock of Christmas spirit." This
will be the sixteenth consecutive
Christmas that the Elks have assisted
the poor in Columbia. About one
hundred and fifty local business men
and fifty farmers living near the city
are backing the movement. The or
ganization has a permanent committee
for charitable work during the year.
Relief Work By Mothers' Clubs.
The Mothers' Clubs of the element
ary schools are doing much for the
relief of the poor of Columbia through
visiting committees and donations of
old clothes. These clothes are repair
ed and cleaned for the poor children
who are in danger of staying away
from school because of the cold weath
er and the lack of warm clothing.
Each grade school has its separate
organization made up ot the teachers,
mothers of the school children and
other women interested In this relief
work. The expense is small, as most
of tbe contributions are in the form
of old clothes. Repairing of shoes en
tails the largest expense, and this
amounts to very little, for this work
is done by the cobblers for the price
of the leather.
Each organization attends to its
particular work Independently of the
others and of the Charity Organization
Society. This condition, the officials
of both organizations belieye, may
lead to duplication of appeals on the
part of the,poor. One person may ask
the mothers' club for aid and then al
so pay the Charity Organization of
fice a visit to plead for help.
A Better Method.
Co-operation among these organi
zations, it Is believed by both ot them,
would lead to a stricter and safer
method of relief. A record of all
cases aided by the mothers clubs
should be regularly turned over to the
secretary of the charity society for in
spection. This would do away with
the possibility of persons appealing to
both places for relief.
The work of the mothers' clubs Is

primarily to keep the children in
school, since it is believed shabby and
insufficient clothing will make the
child reluctant to attend regularly.
This is the first year ot this work for
the mothers' clubs and the members
feel well satisfied with results so far
attained. Next year they hope to es
tablish the work on a sounder finan
cial basis. Money this year is raised
by bazars, oyster suppers and simi
lar activities.

Arrests For Aiding- Mexicans.
ny United Press
EL PASO, Dec 16. Wholesale ar
rests of Americans and Mexicans here
and at other points along the border
accused of breach of neutrality laws
in agitating and aiding the revolutions
and revolutionary actions of different
Mexican factions are planned by
United States secret service agents.
Members of the various revolutionary
juntas are now under surveillance by
this Government's agents but action
is held in abeyance pending ratifica
tion of the American-Mexican media
tion for protocol.
One of the provisions is for the de
portation of Calleus forces engaged In
revolutionary action. Seeret service
men have been directing thfeir atten
tion since the capture of Chihuahua
City by the Villlstas to the source of
the part of ammunition supplies used
by Villa, which was not captured from
the Mexican forces. PosiUve evidence
has been obtained that Villa received
28,000 cartridges the night before the
fall of the northern capital. Federal
authorities here believe these came
from the American side of the border.
That Villa Is disposing his troops
for another important movement Is
indicated by reports to United States
authorities here this afternoon. An
employe of the Bablcora ranch ar
riving here stated that a band of Vil

STATE
CROP VALES
III
MARKED INCREASE
Year's Crops Bring- Twelve
and One-Half Millions
More Than in 1915.
CORN YIELD" DROPS
Prevailing High Prices Bring
txcess Wheat Acreage
Shows Large Loss.
Missouri farm products are valued
at $231,888,951 this year, or about
twelve and one-half million dollars
more than last year, according to the
annual crop report of the Missouri
State Board of Agriculture, Issued yes
terday by W. L. Nelson, assistant sec-
I retary.
The total value this year showed a
big excess over last year In spite ot
the fact that the corn crop was al
most 19,000,000 bushels below the
amount last year and wheat yielded'
only a little more than half the nor
mal harvest The prevailing high
prices of all farm products was re
sponsible for the increase
"While prices for farm products are
high," says Mr. Nelson, "it is also true
that the cost of production due to in
creased acre yields and to the high
cost of living, which hits the farmer
just aa it does everybody else was nev
er before so great. Were it not for
the somewhat higher prices now pre
vailing every pound of beef or pork,
every pound of butter, every quart of
cream and even every dozen eggs sold
would represent a loss. In view ot
the proposed boycotts on many food
products due to lack ot understand
ing or to conditions for which the far
mer is In no way responsible and ov
er which he has no control there is
grave danger that farmers, fearing
for the future, may dispose ot their
breeding stock and curtail operations
generally. This they may do instead
of engaging more extensively in live
stock, dairying, poultry raising and
kindred activities."
In arriving at the results, figures
from each of the 114 counties of the
state are carefully considered. Prices
are for December 1. It should be
borne in mind that $231,88951 does
not represent the total value of all
Missouri agricultural products, but
only such field and garden crops as
are enumerated. Nor Is the value of
Missouri livestock included In this
report.
The estimated corn crop for the
year was only 139,909,735 bushels, as
compared with 220,235,191 bushels last
year. The average yield was 19 bush
els per acre, an'd at the estimated state
price of 86.7 cents the value is $121,
294,528 considerably more than one
million dollars a county. St. Charles
County with an acre yield ot 34 bush
els in average production. Atchison
County with 4,794,141. bushels to its
credit, is first in total production. The
northwest section of the state leads
in total yield and average per acre.
This section with 2,001,033 acres in
corn, grew 48,568,901 bushels, an ev
erage of 24.2 bushels an acre.
The average wheat yield was only
8.3 bushels an acre, although high
prices offset the loss. It is estimat
ed that farmers lost more than five
million dollars before the high prices
came In December.
In central section the average was
seven bushels an acre. The acreage
seeded for 1917 Is the smallest far
years, being but 92.6 as much for 1916.
