The fishermen of the Grants Pass
district, both those who angle for
sport and those who fish commerci
ally, are In favor of the absolute pro
hibition of tbe use ot tbe set net
or the seine In the watera of Ihe
Rogue. This sentiment wss ' pro
nounced at the meeting or the' Jose
phine County Game and Fish Pro
tective association, held in the Com
mercial club rooms, Friday evening.
The meeting had been called upon
the Initiative or members or the as
sociation, but members of the. local
fishermen's union, composed of the
commercial fishermen, were also In
vited. Wltford Allen was chosen
chairman, and Jos. Wharton secre
tary. . After much discussion. reso
lution waa unanimously adopted ask
ing that the use of Ihe seine and set
pel be prohibited anywhere In the
river, and that drift nets having not
less than H Inch mesh be perifiUt
ed from April 1st to August 1st for
the taking or salmon. The rait flsh
Ing for stlverslde salmon at the
mouth of the river 'waa not opposed,
though netting upon the upper river
during the rail came under the ban,
being deaired by neither the angler
nor the commercial risherman.
The teatimony of the anglers pres
ent waa that the fly fishing during
the past season had been much bet
ter than Id yeara when tbe river was
absolutely closed, and that by pro
hibiting aelnea and let nets the steel
heads and other trout could ascend
the stream unmolested. Inadequate
fish ways at the Golden Drift and
Ray-Gold dams was one of the rea
sons ascribed fo a lack ot fish high
er up the stream, and Senator Smith
stated that the state fish commission
had promised that proper flshwaya
would be built
Every angler testified to the bet
terment or riy flBhlng for steelheads
when the salmon were taken rrom the
stream by netting, and there was
complete harmony between the two
schools or fishermen In the conclu
sions arrived at.
To prepare data setting forth the
facta In the case for presentation to
the members of the legislature the
appointment of a committee from
those present at the meeting waa au
thorised. The committee named is
composed of Messrs, M. J. Anderson,

, Part. Dec. !. France's answer
to Germany's peace terms Is
Wresting of more than twelve
square miles or territory rrom the
enemy. Capture or more than 7,(00
Germans. Gain of several German
trenches, the villages ot Vaeberau
vllle and Louvemont. tbe farms or
Chambrettes ajid the fortifications ot
Hardomont and Dezonvaux. .
The answer ,was another one of
General Nlvllle'a sudden "pushes" in
the Verdun sector. The newly creat
ed commander of French armies In
the north and northeast opened his
attack yesterday and within a lew
hours had again swept away from the
comy territory which It had taken
norths or sanguinary fighting to ob
tain. It was another stroke such as
Mvelle, then commanding tho' Verdun
sector .executed when ha pulled Fort
Douaumont from the Germans. ,',
Berlin, via Sayvllle, Dec. 1C The
French have succeeded In pushing
.back German forces from some of
their most advanced positions In the
Verdun district. It was announced In
today'a statement. The Teutonic
troops It waa aald, had gone Into pre
pared second tine defenses.
Tbe same statement reported s suc
cessful new thrust by the Germane
against British troops around Ypres.
The war office located the scene or
the French "push" and the new Ger
man second line positions around Tal-
ouridge and the heights north or
Louvemont and Chambrettes and
south or Bezonvaux. (These posi
tions are all northwest of Douau
mont.) The German thrust at the British
lines occurred southesst of Zillebeke.
The Berlin statement details the ad
vance to the second line of enemy
trenches, the garrison or which fled.
THE WAR AT A GLANCE
llerlln Admissions confirmed the
extent of France's thrust north of
Verdun, stating that German troops
had gone back to prepared second
line positions. Further details from
JVu-ia aald the victory waa achieved
by four French troop divisions di
rected against at leant five whole
German dlvlnloum This would seem
to mean that the French had won,
despite a preponderance of at leant
twenty thouwand men In- favor of
their enemy. The figures also give
an Indication of tho magnitude of
the struggle -1HO.OOO men apparent

Eureka, Cal.. Dee. 16. With the
huge breakers on Humboldt bay
slowly but snrely, pushing the strand

admitted that unless a line Is Im
mediately made rasl to the Ill-fated
vessel, she may break up on the

The submarine Is holding Its own
remarkably well, salvaging officers
stated today. . . i
The craft rode the surf through
the night and although washed ap
preciably nearer shore appeared to
be withstanding the pound''-) ut the
breakers. Early today men from the
court guard cutter McCulloch lexan
the task ot getting a hawser to the
submarine In an effort to tow the
vessel a short distance nut, or. at
least, stay Its progress toward shore
until the naval salvage vessel Arapo-'

Providing the hull is intact, there
seems to be little doubt that the ves

By wading out within 20 teet of

this line at high tide this evening,
in an effort to take the submarine '
