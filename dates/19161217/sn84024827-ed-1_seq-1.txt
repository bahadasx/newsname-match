TELLS BANKERS TO
STUDY PROBLEMS NOW7
Collective Buying in Europe,
Government Aid In All!
Ihino-s. Will Lome Uut oil
War, He Declares.
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Dec. 16. Prank A. Van-
derlip, president of the National CityJ
Bank of New York, addressing the
Chicago Bankers' Club tonight, warn
ed his auditors that the United States
would have to meet economic and so-
cial problems as a result of the war
that would tax the Ingenuity and re
sourcefulness of the nation, and call
ed upon, bankers to prepare to aid in
the solution of these problems.
The belief that the United
States could proceed along its
own way unaffected by the war
and seeking only to keep out of
it, he declared, teemed a lack of
imagination, blindness of vision
and complete failure to under
stand the unity of the financial
world.
Grave Days Coming
'Unless I utterly misjudge affairs."
he said, "there are going to develop
for this country problems of the grav
est import problems that will need
for their correct solution the atten
tion of the most enlightened minds.
Socialism in Europe
"State socialism in Europe may de
velop problems the like of which nev
er concerned our minds. ' We may
have to meet collective buying, state
aided industries, forms of government
al cooperation with business quite out
side our range of thought. p Govern
ment control of ocean borne com
merce and novel factors in. interna
tional finance will be subjects for na
tional consideration. They may come
out of the war changes in forms of
government that will have profound
and world influence.
Praises Federal Banks
Mr. Vanderlip reviewed the results
of the war on the United States up to
the present, the gold situation, the
developments of credits. He discuss
ed national legislation with praise for
the federal bank system and for the
federal trade commission.
' Wants Better Banking
"Does not the objection to the prin
ciple involved when governmental re
lations are injected into business lie
quite as much with bankers as with
the legislators? Will we not always
find the people groping to do through
governmental agencies things that are
left undone or are badly done by in
dividual incentive? Must we not safe
guard the future from an unwise par
ticipation of government in business
by seeing that business is so well con
ducted, so fairly administered, so com
pletely responsive to legitimate needs
that there will be no sound reason for
government oartlcipation?"

Universal Service
Bill Comes Before
Senators Monday
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 16. Major
General Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff
and an advocate of universal military
service, will appear before a Senate
sub-committee Monday when it begins
hearings on Senator Chamberlain's
universal training bill. Both sides of
the question will be heard before the
hearings close.
General Scott made a plea for uni
versal service in his annual report,
published recently and is known to
have spoken on the subject for the en
tire general staff. His report was is
sued with the approval of Secretary
Baker, although the latter reserved
bis own opinion.
The Chamebrlain bill provides for
an extensive system under which all
physically fit youths between 12 and
23 receive military instruction, those j
between 18 and 23 constituting the
active forces. Officers of the general
staff, at the request of Senator Cham
berlain, have prepared a ' substitute,
providing a simpler form,', however,
which probably will be offered as a
substitute.

A short, sharp battle brought to the
French today their third smashing vie

of Verdun. Every objective of the
French commanders was obtained.
Although the Germans offered a des

liked.

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Dec. 16. The
' question of the power and impera
tive necessity of the national gov
ernment to make preparation for
defense "is little srArt of treason."
it was declared here today by
former Secretary of War Lindlt-y
M. Garrison, in an address on
"Nationalism" before the Lawyers'
club. After reviewing the passage
of many powers and duties from
state government to the national
government, he said, in the matter
of preparedness the central gov
ernment "flinched and faltered
and sought fy pass its neglected
duty to the states," the result be
ing a "lamentable failure."
Washington's Failure.
"From the viewpoint of the national
entity," Mr. Garrison said, "national
ism is the possession of and the ex
ercise by the national government of
every power and function necessary
to perform properly the collective du
ties and to fulfill completely the col-
lective obligations of the nation. From
' thn vinvnnint if tha ritlTun nntinnnt-
j ism is the yielding, not in theory but
j in practice, of his mind, his heart, and
his spirit to the welfare of the nation,
and sacrifice, devotion and loyalty."
Won't Face Issue.
One of .the most dangerous sent!-
menu threatening the integrity of the
nation.' he said, is that which "util -
izes me natural ana universal aonor-
ance of war as a reason for not prepar-
ing for its possibilities.'
IS ALMOST TREASON.
"Self defense is the cardinal
duty of a nation," he said. "The
national government ia the only
agency that can make preparation.
To deny it power or to question
the imperative necessity of its ex
erting that power is little short of
treason.
SIDE-STEPS DUTY.
"This is a duty which the na
tional government has neglected.
In this particular the modern
' tendency has been reversed. The
national government flinched and
faltered and sought to pass its
neglected duty to the states. The
result was, and was bound to be
a lamentable failure."
Wants no Alliance.
If the United States, he said, en
gaged as has been suggested, in a
meters along the whole front, at vari
ous points rushing further out.
The battle began at lu o'clock in
the morning with the left flank of the
French opposite Vacherauville and the
right tlank on Fort Vaux.
As the church clock struck the hour
the French in a storm of steel putting
every shot in behind the German Hue,
the French infantry made one of its
characteristic dashes and reached
Vauchemuville, where they drove the
Germans from house to house until
the village was entirely in their hands
