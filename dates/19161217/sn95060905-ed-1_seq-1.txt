possession it has been for a great

the opinion there that It should be
long to the state The presentation
was made last July.
With the hanging r the Constitu

two noted flags The Rough Riders'

what prompted him to inent the new
article, he sas, was the present and

d States "Saie paper" continuously
being harped upon b the goiernment
and b the railroad.' stated the In
entor. wh owas In Tombstone today
enroute to I.os Angeles on business
connected with the manufacture of
hi product, "was what gae me the
idea of trying to find a way of saving
he envelope in correspondence work
Another was the saving in time of
addressing the envelope and the third
Is the Inexpenslveness of the compact
letter head and envelope, while still
another Is the fact that there Is no
"ch'ance for on- man's mail to be mall

In large offices where there are thou
sands of letters written dallv"
Briefly, the Invention is nothing
more than a piece of paper, letter head
size, both edges being perforated from
top to bottom, one-half an inch In
width and gummed half way on each
side, as the flap or an envelope
The regular letter head is printed at
the top with date line, and on the
back at the top In the corner Is print
cd the return, as on an envelope This
completes the compact letter and en
velope To write a letter the top
htlf of the letter Is turned back just
below the date line, and In this flap
Is Inserted a carbon, specially pro
vided for. which, when the address Is
written. It Is carboned on the flap, so
that when the letter Is completed all
that Is necessary to be ready for
mailing is to moisten both outside
flaps and gum together The enve
lope Is then completed as It has al
ready been addressed by the carbon
All it takes then Is the stamp and It
Is ready for mailing. When the man
at the other end rx?etves the letter
all he has to do Is to tear both ends
off the envelope at the perforations

phur Spring Valley.
The above fiom the Bisbee Review of yesterday
eonliims the persistent rumors that have been in ef
fect the past week that our old friend Douglas again
has design-, on the coint house. Hut the Daily Pros
pector will say. and will say emphatically, that when
the Dougln tribe of selfish boomers for their own in
terests solely, get thiough they will wish they had
never started. To think that "the 10.000 taxpayers
of Cochise county aie going to vote to saddle a debt
ranging from .soilu.iltM) to .-sTO.MO on themselves just
to give the selli-h interests of Douglas the county
seat, is absiiid. Take Bisbee, for instance. Do the
Douglasites think she is going to lie idle and watch
Douglas grab everything? A good example of
Douglas greed can be taken fiom the way she manip
ulated the placing of soldiers along the border. Who
cot the most of the tioops? Douglas. Through a
few pulls at Washington. Douglas got more soldiers
than she could handle, when Bisbee, which is only a
few miles from the border, got only a handful, com
pared with Douglas. Later Bisbee raised such a
rightcfus howl that the department did assign a con
siderable number of Uncle Sam's men there, and
what did Douglas do.' Again manipulated the
wires and took away most of Bisbee's troops, and
brought them to Douglas. Why does Douglas want
the troops? Solely for the plumose of stimulating
business, and it is a well known fact that when Uncle
Sam docs decide to move the soldiers from the bor
der that business will drop off several hundred per
cent. Douglas always wants everything, and that
crowd has had designs of placing their talons on the
court house and dragging it over to the Mexican bor
der for many yea re. They have elected legislators
and paid lobbyists to go to Phoenix and have passed
a law that would facilitate the removal of the county
seat and now that they have the law they propose to
remove the county seat soon after the first
of the year, and the most absurd part of it is that
they believe the Cochise county taxpayers will cut
their own throats and vote the big debt upon them
selves to the advantage of the few who will be bene
fitted by the move. Tombstonites in a body, will be
joined by Bisbee, Benson, Willcox, and the balance
of the count' to fight the greedy vultures to a stand
still, standing up for our rights and see that the
county seat remains where it has always been, serv
ing all the people and not removing it to the Mexi
can border serving Douglas alone for that is just
what Douglas wants.

ABOUT
SEAT
REMOVAL
Upholding Tombstone and her citi
zens on the stand of keeping the coun
tv seat located here Editor Sturdevant
of the Bisbee Relew toda in flowery
words editoriall commended the re
buke of W A McSparron to a Doug
las citizen who had the audacity to
broach the subject of removal, which
was recentl printed in The Pros
pector What the Review said today
was as follows-
HAII,' TOMBSTONE!
Aborthe attempts to separate
the Cochise count court house
from Tombstone hae never met
with a more effectUe reproof than
that administered by W A. Mc
Sparron. modestl described as a
business man In the city of sep
olchral cognomen Business man
forsooth Rather a poet of rare
parts, a modern Homer In whose
soul slumbered the diine afflatus
awaiting only the spark of chic
jeapord to cause his beloved
Tombstone to be girded as it were
b a flaming sword of rhetorical
admonition and defiance.
Curse those conventions which
limit newspaper narrations to a
literal treatment of an and all
subjects .et even this cannot
desecrate the beaut nor dull the
lustre of McSparron's Iliad Brief
1, the facts are these:
One of Douglas' citizens, a ven
turesome Agamemnon, made bold
to suggest in the presence of Mc
Sparron that a movement was
aborning to transplant the court
house in the Smelter City Did
McSparron reach for his hip pock
et? Nav reader, thrice nay.
Prithee, then what did McSpar
ron do? McSparron's face beam
ed with the radiance of glorifica
tion and these words he did
speak:
"My esteemed friend from the
border clt of Douglas, may I
commend you for your able re
marks You have stated that on
and perhaps before the death of
this old year will witness a move
ment for the removal of one or
these most treasured landmarks
of Cochise county; one of the
mainstays of Tombstone, the
COURTHOUSE, and in reply
might I state My friend, when
the cacti cease to grow In the de
sert; when the pine will require
water; when the leaves of the
sagebrush curl from the heat;
when the opaque and golden hues
are no more to be seen on the
summits of the Mustangs; when
the ultamarlne and Van Dykes
hues which blend from the bot
tom to the crest of the Dragoons,
cease to cast to the discerning
eye their beautiful colors; when
the golden ball which we call the
sun, ceases to set In the west;
when all the birds, the beasts and
flowers have gone to eternal rest.
THEN', my friend, shall Douglas
get the courthouse."
Any secret ambition which Bis
bee may have harbored on the
subject of courthouse acquisition
are hereby abandoned. Never as
long as McSparron stands at the
portal of Tombstone ready to
overwhelm us with his verbal re-

fled in the government suit against
the Omaha. Land and Investment com

the malls In sales of phantom wild
horses on the government reservation
n Coconino county, Arizona. The
government alleges $1,000,000 was se
cured from sales of Imaginary horses
Silvius said he went to Coconino
count, secured the aid of expert
horse wranglers and captured thl.teen
horses but they were maverl'.ks and
the sheriff replevined them is prop
erty of the state.
"After much litigation," Silvius te
tified, "I secured five horses and ship
ped to a ranch at Highmore, S D
That was all I secured in exchange
for real estate worth $10,000."
Ben Fldler. Salem, S. D.. testified
he paid $14,000 for a herd of wild
horses He captured seventy, but
only thirteen of them bore the brand
he purchased He shipped the thlr
tern to Ixis Angeles, he said, but
"most of them died before they were
sold "
John Sinclair, cattleman of Flag
staff, Arizona, testied he sold J. Sid
ney Smith, one of the defendants. ISO
head of wild horses and Smith asked
him to make out the bill of sale for
1,100 head, which he refused to do.
About a month later, he testified,
"Smith made a deal with A. O. Perry
(another defendant) and raised the
number In the bill or sale from 150 to
1100"
Smith Is president of the United
States Livestock company, an Omaha
corporation.
The government will rest its case
tomorrow afternoon. Sixty-eight wit

Our deepest sympathy goes out
