A runner exposition in me. m.-.....
government's attitude toward the
Herman peace proposal is contained in
!tho following statement, obtained
from the Russian foreign office by the
Associated Press:
! "A complete and emphatic rejection
j by Russia of Hermany's offer can
'hardly have been necessary to con
vince America and other neutrals of
:the attitude which the allies will take
toward Germany's insincere and theat-
rical peace proposal. Hermany's w ish

na-'ing peace negotiations uses more ui
forinified and direct methods. She does
not advertise her intentions tnrougn
out the world before her proposals
have even been transmitted to
powers concerned.
the
Merely Sensational Move.
"The Herman declaration has the
character of a sensational act of pub
licity, calculated to prepossess the
neutral powers. Reyond this it does
not merit serious consideration. What
the enemy suggests is a peace dictated
y her and in accordance with the
very ideas which the allies are ngiu
ing to destroy; ideas of Herman he
gemony of the Prussian type.
"Russia cannot speak of peace with
an opponent w Ii cj has proclaimed him
self the victor. The rejection of Her
many's proposal In no sense places
Russia in the position of a nation not
desirous of a durable peace or insen-
isilie to the urgent necessity of rcs
Icuing Kurope lrom the calamity whb h
; has cast its shadow over the entire
Inter- world. Put Russia will continue to
suffer this calamity and add indefi
nitely to the sacrifices which she al
ready has made, rather than submit
to the great catastrophe threatened
by Herman imperial ambitions.
"What Russia, in common with hei
allies, desires, is not a destroyed Ger
many, but the final defeat of these
ambitions of Herman domination.
When On-many desires a fair and last

Washington. Dec. lti. The for
warding today of the central powers ,
proposals for peace removed the cen-
ter of Interest In the peace move to j
the allied capituls, particularly I-on-j
don, where the final attitude of the j
entente is expected to find expression.
With the announcement that the'
proposals had gone forward to the al- j
lied countries, without any accom
panying comment by this government, j
speculation here turned for the time
being from what President Wilson
may do in initiating neutral media
tion to what Premier Lloyd-iieorge
will declare to be the attitude of the
allied nations when he speaks on the
subject, probably next week, in par
liament. Text or Note Harmonised.
The three versions of the proposal,
differing slightly because' of the
translations made in llerlin, Vienna
and Constantinople, were harmonized
into one official American translation,
a single copy of which was sent to
each of the American ambassadors
and ministers in the seven belligerent
countries where tho tinted State
represents Herman, Austrian or Tur
kish diplomatic interests. The actual
official texts probably will be for
warded later In order to preclude any
chance of error or inMnterp .'ctatlon. 1 temporarily Inerwiae-l to considerable

Delay May Prove Wise.
The two-day delay while a uniform
translation of the peace notes was be-
ing prepared here may, in the belief
of some diplomatists, constitute Itself
a hint to the belligerents of the weight
that is attached by American officials
to any peace proposal. In the same
quarters, tt is pointed out that the de
lay may have had Ihe effect of pre
venting a hasty or premature expres
sion by the allied nations. There has
been no suggestion, however, that
either of these considerations was a j
factor In delaying transmission of- th
communications.
Knssia's Action Definite.
Tho unanimous declaration of the
Russian duma aKainst the peace pro
posal aroused great Interest, here, par
ticularly in view of the many rumors
during the last few months hinting at
a possible separate peace for Russia.
The Russian empire has been regard
ed In some quarters as tho keystone
In the pence situation, and informa
tion as to the diplomatic struggle In
progress there is meager. It is known,
however, that a senii-revolution has
occurred against the Herman elements
in the court and the bureaucracy and
the action of the council and the dum
recently in acting together for the
first time in history, is taken as an In
dication of the great strengthening of
the anti-Herman party.
riti: i! VICTORY AT
Vr.KPl ANSW KKS K ISI It
London, Dec. lti. The foreign of
fice announced before closing today
that it. had not yet received the pea'-o
note, and the prominent officials dis
claimed knowledge of its contents be
yond what the newspapers had pub
lished. The French victory al Verdun is ac
claimed by all the London papers as
the French reply to the flerma i em
peror's speech to bis troops In Alsace
and Chancellor von Itethinann-Holl-veg's
claim of tho invincibility of
Herman arms.
The opinions
as reflected in
in the Rritish press
the latest editorials
ere almost unanimous that the least
the government can do is to make a
statement on the allies' aims and oh
iects, or ask for the presentation of
the Herman terms.
The weekly reviews, including the
financial organs, lake the same line,
as do also the provincial papers. The
inly notable exception has been the
Northcliffe group which immediately
urged that Hreat Rritain should ig
nore the overtures.
There appears to be a consensus of
opinion that the allies should not con
sider entering into a conference until
they know approximately the central
powers' policy, and unless they con
sider that that policy contains the
seeds for agreement. The Russian
