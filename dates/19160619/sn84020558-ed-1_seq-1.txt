General James Parker withdrew' from !
Mexico today the several hundred j
American troops he had sent in near I
Rrownsville yesterday in pursuit of ;
bandits that had attacked a small de- j
tachmont of infantry on the American .
side the night before. I
On the way out armed men. charac-
teiizod by Parker as bandits, opened i
! sniping fire on the retreating;
column, making a light rear guard ;
action resulting in the killing of two
of the attacking partly and the'
wounding of two others. None of. the,
Americana were hit. I
i
General Parker's explanation toj
General Funs-ton of his withdrawal j
was that he regarded the dispersal of j
the bandits, the object of the expedi
tion, as accomplished. i
I'nci. mealed astonishment was'
shown at the department head(Uar-1
tor-: "hen it was learned that the,
Americans were back on this side of I
the line, although there was displayed
no disposition to criticize Genevol j
Parker. It was realized that a longer;
stay on the -Mexican side probably j
would have caused a clash between!
the Americans and the troops of the'
ie facto government. j
General Parker's orders to Major i
Kdward Anderson which was to move
his troops back into Texas, came after j
an exchange of messages by him and ;

the continuation of the' presence of

military authorities have seized
the Southern Pacific of Mexico
system and cut all telegraph lines
at the border, according to private
advices here late today.
The Mexican custom house rec
ords have been transferred from
Nogales, Mex., to far south of the
international line.
A demonstration of civilians in
Nogales, Sonora, ended early this
morning. Boys 12 years old there
have been armed by the military
authorities, while 18 carloads of
Mexican families have been sent
south. Several Americans arrested
there last night were released this
morning.
. General Calles, in his rush by
special train to the border, arrived
early this morning and left imme
diately for Naco.
A strict censorship of all mes
sages to the interior is in force
at Nogales.
, Fear is felt for the safety of
: Americans at Empalme, Sono-a.
Excitement in Nog.iles
NOC.AI.KS, Ariz., June IS. Condi -i
tions on both sides of the international
. boundary here were in a state of ex
i cited anticipation. In Nogales, Ariz.,
few Mexican servants employed in
American families reported for work
' WrJay. while frm Nogales, Sonora,
Mexican women, children and noii-com-bntants
were being rushed south over
the line of the Southern Pacific of
Mexico to Mr'gdale.na. Orders were is
sued by military authorities today al
lowing io railroad rolling stock to
; cross from Mexico. While the military
i and civil guards were prepared for
i "any eventuality," especially close
watch was being kept upon the large
. Mexican population in the Arizona city.
All rolling stock of the Southern Pa
cific of Mexico railroad, it was re
ported, has been confiscated by Mex
ican soldiers. A switch engine was
boarded and seized by a squad of-sol
diers as it crossed the border here to
Mexican Nogales last night. Reports
received here today said Mexican of
ficials of Sunora had stated they were
ordered to seize all railroad equipment
by Gen. Carranza.
Incitement apparently had abated
to some extent in Nogales, Sonora,
today, but there Ftill was much uneasi
ness on both sides of the hortler.
Four or five trains left the Mexican
towu during the night and early today
for Magdalena, all cars being crowded
'.with Mexican women and children.
I All archives of the Mexican customs
' house and pnstoffice also were removed
t- the south.
Gen. P. Elias Calles, commander of
j the Sonora military, was at Del Kin,
on the railroad line to Cananea today.
Tt was stated Mexicans who. last night
..signed what they believed to be re
ceipts for guns and ammunition issued
by Mexican officials, learned today they
r mjd in reaijtv .signed enlistments in the
Mexican army.
An unconfirmed report stated that
between 4.000 and f,000 Mexican troops
had arrived at Lomas, four miles south
of Nogales.

ceived today from General Obregon in
Mexico City, none of the Mexicans
wire permitted to cross the American
frontier.
Reports from various towns in Chi

citizenry generally is oeing armeu aim
that a furore of anticipatory excitement
prevails throughout northern Mexico.
On the Mexican side of the river to
night only thirty-four men turned in

score yesterday. Military men here
continued to express confidence in the
ability of General Pershing's command
to protect itelf in any emergency,
even though private dispatches quoted
the expeditionary commander as ad
mitting that the situation is very tense.
It was pointed out that General Persh

any direction from his line, despite Gen
eral Jacinto Trevino's recent ultima
tum, if he considers his flanks imper

some trivial incident, according to re
ports from the field tonight. Detach

Republican A. P. Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, June IS. Virtually
the entire mobile strength of the Na
tional Guard of all states and the Dis
trict of Columbia will be ordered mus
tered into the federal service tonight
by President Wilson. About 100.000
men are expected to respond to the
call. They will be mobilized immedi
ately for such service on the Mexican
border as may later be assigned to
them. t
General Frederick Funston, com
manding the border rorces, will des
ignate the time and place for move
ment of guardsmen to the. internaliou
line as the occasion shall require.
In announcing the- orders Secretary
Baker said the slate forces would be
employed only to guard the border and
that no additional troop movemcfct.s
into Mexico were contemplated, except
in puisuil oi iamci.
Simultaneously with the National
Ouard call. Secretary Daniels, of the
navy department, ordered additional
war vessels to Mexican waters on both
coasts to safeguard American lives.
At the war navy and state depait
ments it was stated that no new ad
vices as to the situation in Mexico had
come to precipitate the new orders.
Within the last two weeks, however,
tension has been increasing steadily.
The crisis presented by General Ca..
rranza's note demanding the recall ot
General Pershing's expeditionary fores
has been followed by a virtual unti-
matum served on the American officer
by General Trevino, the Mexican com
mander in Chihuahua. To this was
added yesterday the possibility that
American and Mexican troojis clashed
across the border from San Benito,
Texas.
Administration officials made no at
tempt to conceal tonight their relief
over the safe return of Major Ander
son's cavalry squadron to the Amer
ican side of the border. The troops
crossed in pursuit of bandits in the
i face of intimations that they would be
attacked if they did so. General Fun
ston himself reported that he antici
pated fighting, presumably with Ca
rranza troops.
Mobilization of the national guards
men to support General Funston's line
will pave the way for releasing some
30,000 regulars for immediate service
in Mexico in the event of open hostili
ties with the Carranza government.
The guardsmen themselves could not
be used beyond the line without au
thority of congress and unless they had
volunteered for that duty as they are
called out under the old militia law.
The new law which would make them
available for any duty under the fed
eral government, goes into effect July 1.
The entire mobile regular army in
the United States, several provisional
regiments of coast artillery service a.s
infantry and the national guard of
Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, nov
are on the border or in Mexico. Defi
nite figures have never been made
public, but it is understood General
Funston has about 40.000 regulars and
probably five thousand or more
guardsmen of whom 10,000 regulars
are with General Pershing or scattered
along his line of communication from
Xamiquipa, Mex., to Columbus, N. M.
Telegrams calling for the militia
were sent tonight to the governors of
all states except the three whoso
guardsmen already have been mus-
(Continued on Page Two)
the soldiers of the American command
have been warned to exercise great
care in distinguishing bandits from
Mexican soldiers. Close watch is being
maintained on lines of communcaton
and upon the passes through which
troops might make their way over the
Sierra Madres from Sonora.
Leaves of absence, which had been
granted a number of officers and men
of the base camp here, were revoked
by the commanding officer, the explan
ation being offered that the situation
dr-es not justify their leaving their
commands.
