THE Armory ring* to

o» hundreds of men.
There are men with gold
cord* on their hat*, men
with red cord* on their
hat*, men with hkte cord*
on their hats, and men
with no hat* and no cord*
at all.
There are uniforms that
•re dull and worn, and
uniform* that are pressed
and bright.
There are hoots that are
shapeless and stained, and
boot* that shriek their
brown newness.
There are men whose
hair and beard* arc white;
there are wide-eyed boys
with heads held high and
guns clenched tight.
In the big library, tbft walla are
covered with charta for eye-testing
and the floor with queer devices
for measuring of height, weight
and atrength.

WASHINGTON
EXCITED BY
WAR RUMORS
Reported Ultimatum From Carran
za Prompts Fears That Mexican
Troops Will Precipitate Trouble
on Border; U. S. PlavsTrump Card
JUAREZ, June 19.—Gen. Francisco Serrano, war
Minister Obregon's chief of staff, arrived here today on
a secret mission. It is rumored Serrano will take com
mand of all Carranza troops in Northern Mexico in the
event of war with the United States. Serrano refused
to discuss his visit.
WASHINGTON. June America's mailed fist con«
front-- the Carranza government today. Order* for practically
all state militia for border service, backed by dispatch of
more fighting ship* and transports constitute the threat.
It is the administration's last trump card to quiet a
troublesome situation.
If thi«• last trump does not take the trick, officials fear
war will follow.
Some administration officials frankly admit a fear that
dispatch of 100,000 more men to the border may cause some
of the more reckless of Carranza commanders to commit an
act that could have only one result.
Others »eem certain the mailed fist will have the de
sired effect.
They believe, tho, that the United Stafes will be thoroly
prepared hy the latent step for anything that develops below
the border.
CALLING MILITIA DOES NOT MEAN
INTERVENTION. WASHINGTON INSISTS
Calling the militia does not mean intervention.
The policy is still to keep Gen. Pershing's column wher*
it is and to strengthen the border patrol so much as to end
the recent outbursts of banditry.
The most disturbing tiling in a mass of perplexing ru
mor- and facts is the report that Carranza his set an ulti
matum demanding the withdrawal of American troops within
a week Behind the militia call last night lies a realization,
officials admit, that Carranza is growing gradually weaker,
with a consequent possibility of trouble between his regime
and the United States
The economic situation in Mexico is extremely bad, ac
cording to official reports.
This reacts for trouble by creating a chaotic condition
and by stimulating banditry among men whose only sus
tenance seems to lie in loot.
HOPE MILITIA MOVE WILL
HOLD CARRANZA IN CHECK
The militia call, officials hoped, may cause Carranza tc
make efforts to hold his men in check
The orders issued last night contemplate having about
100,000 more men ready for border work.
The demands of Carranzista Gen. Trevino that Pershing's
forces do not move except out —under pain of a Mexican
attack, is regarded here as a part of Mexican bombast which
will go unheeded.
Army men openlv express fear that neither Carranza nor
his officers will lie able to prevent an attack on Pershing's
column, and the consequent precipitation of intervention.
Should this occur, they said, war would follow.
Admitting the gravity of the situation. Secretary Lan
sing said: " There is more excitement and irritation in Mexico
than heretofore."
The statement was the more significant in view of Lan
sing's refusal for weeks to make any comment except to men
tion "co-operatic n" with the de facto government.
FORCEFUL REFUSAL OF DEMAND
FOR WITHDRAWAL SENT TO CARRANZA
A note of 10,000 words or more a strong and forceful
refusal to heed Carranza's withdrawal request, will be en
route to Carranza before night.
This note may precipitate the trouble that every official
fears -an actual clash between Mexican*! and American
troops.
Announcement that the note would go today was made
after the Mexican embassy had delivered a secret note to
Lansing, presumably a request that this government's reply
be hastened.
Consul Silliman is en route to the border. Meanwhile,
new warning's to Americans to quit the country have gone
forward
CALLS IT ACID TEST
WASHINGTON, June 19 —
President Wilson today awaited
results of the acid test applied
to the men of the country In
the Issuance for Nstlonal
Guard mobilization.
On May 31, in Arlington, the
president told 500 veterans of
civil war that "within a month"
It might be up to the nation's
Industrial chiefs to determine
whether the new militia law
was to receive the support
which might be expected from
the business men In their en
thusiasm for preparedness.
President Wilson regards the
present situation as a strict ap
plication of the test.
As rapidly as the war de
partment received reports t»-
day from the militia command
era In the country, they were
forwarded to Wilson.
Washington appreciates that
a real crisit confront* the pres
ident in Mexico.
