"I like Tacoma better than Seat

W. Hart, who saws shingles in
the Phoenix mill at Ballard, was
coming home to spend Sunday
with his father. W. Hart, sr., who
lives on Nortli Cushman avenue.
The young man's work has for

comes "home" to Tacoma regu
larly every week.
Harry O. Woodruff also works
in Seattle but Is at home in Ta

"1 know a lot of people who
live in Tacoma even when they
work somewhere else," he de
clared.
Sick Child Brines One
Miss Mary Stewart was coming
from Seattle to visit her sister,
Mrs. L. D. Bvbee, 413 d North
37th street. There is a sick child
at the By bee home.
So it went, down the length of
the car. Nearly everybody was
coming home, or coming to visit
some one who had a home in Ta
coma.
And last, were the young man
with the clear eyes and the square
shoulders, and the girl with the
fair hair and the new striped silk
suit. They talked sometimes, in
low tones, and sometimes they
were silent more eloquently than
when they talked.
Why were they coming to Ta
coma? They glanced at each
other. "Oh, just for a change of
air," he laughed, and her blush
was illuminating.
Another Home, Maybe
"We've never come by train
before, and we thought we'd like
to see the country," he explained,
carefully. "1 like Tacoma."
Did they live in Seattle?
"Oh, yes," in a vague murmur
from both.
"Was he in business there?"
He shook his head.
"The name?"
"No, Indeed!" he announced,
with a grin; and this time both
faces were red.
"Tacoma-Tacoma; Tacoma-Ta
lotua." sang the trucks beneath
us. And I will bet this week's
salary that there will be another
home In Tacoma very soon.

BOSTON —Boston is a lar_;c
city entirely surrounded by Har
vard accent.
Its streets are very narrow, but
its "A's" are very broad.
Traffic is frequently clogged by
a, broad "A" getting stuck i.e
tween the buildings.
■ One of the principal Industries
of Boston is the sale of charts
and compasses to keep strangers
from losing themselves in tho
crooked streets.
The only person ever known io

the puzzsle king—and Sam was
always lucky anyway.
Boston was the scene of the
