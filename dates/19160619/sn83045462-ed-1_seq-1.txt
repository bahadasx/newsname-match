Early today young: men besieged the
4L street armory and tho recruiting
elation cooking to enlist -tot the gou.1ff.
All of those who applied at the recruitt%
station were sent immediately to
to L street armory, were several officers
of the Medical Corps threw off
their uniforms and went to work examining
the recruits. From the numbers
that came In, officers expressed the
pinion that there would be little trouble
in reaching the war strength.
Both officers and men seem to be
eager to get into the active service
either along the border or tn Mexico,
but there was a feeling among some of
the staff officers today that in view of
the fact that the guard did not have a
fbll brigade, the staff might be left at
Fort Myer while the indivildual organizations
were mustered with troops of
other states. There was a general feeling.
however, that the line officers,
those officers actually in command of
troops, will get into actual service with
the commands they have been drilling
tn the guard.
The National Guard here has what
the War Department designated as a
provisional brigade?that is, a brigade
organised of different units in order to
fulfill a specific purpose. However,
Whether this provisional designation
will be maintained when the local
troops set into service no one at this
time seems to know.
List of the Commands.
The provisional brigade here consists
Of one regiment of infantry, one separate
battalion of infantry, one signal
corps company, one company of coast
artillery, one field hospital, two batteries
of field artillery, one machine
fun company. The signal corps commander.
Capt. O. C. Terry, had been
working on plans for the organization
Of a signal corps battalion, and now
has more men than he can take away
with him unless the War Department
Immediately authorizes the organization
of this unit. He now has 128 men,
and It takes 193 to make the battalion.
By o'clock this evening, he said, he
would have the full force, provided the
War Department Issued the necessary
, Instructions.
Special appeal Is being made by the
Signal Corps officers to telegraph oper>
ators, both wire and wireless, in order
to take the best into the field. The
mobilisation point of this company,
which some time ago was designated
OS Bort Thomas, Kentucky, was this
morning changed to Fort Myer.
The movement of troops to Fort

Maj. Charles R. Lace, assisted by
Capt. Herbert J. Bryson and Lieut.
David W. Tastet, alT medfttfl tflffcei s,
were kept basy all the morning and
afternoon examining: the large number
of recruits. Two large rooms were j
given over as dressing rooms in order I
to expedite the examinations. Three!
men were examined at a time. Dr.!
Luce stated that all of the men who
applied today were of a high-class,
many of them holding good positions
in public and private service.
Retired Officer I* Recalled.
One retired officer, Lieut. William A.
Duvall, was recalled to active duty today
and stationed as recruiting officer
at the L street armory in order to
handle the large number of applications
which are coming in.
There were quite a few mothers and
sisters and other female relatives at the
L street armory, seeking audiences
with the officers, most of them trying
to have their sons or relatives released
from attending the President's call for
troops. However, there is little that
the officers can do now in the way of
releasing these young men.
Requisitions were being hurried
through for a large amount of supplies
in mc w?jr ox unnorms, rines and other
equipment, to supply the additional
number of men which it is hoped to enlist
while the guard is at the Fort Myer
camp. There is enough clothing and I
supplies fully to equip those men who
enlist today, it is declared, while all
those who are already in the guard are
completely outfitted, all ready to take
their places in the line tomorrow morning
when the buglers sound assembly.
The President could not have caught
the local guard at a better time, for
nearly 50 per cent of them are fresh
from the rifle range at Congress
Heights, where they have been making
excellent marks with the rifle. There
is a range not a very great distance
from Fort Myer, a regular army range,
but it has not yet been decided whether
the District troops will be sent there
for additional practice.
Oen. Harvey Receives Call.
When Brig. Gen. Harvey^eceived his
semi-official orders last night he was
at bis home. A telephone .message from
Gen. Mills, chief of the militia division
of the War Department, informed him
I that the President has called out the
entire militia, and briefly told him of
the orders to the District contingent.
Immediately the general called sevi
eral of his staff on the telephone, and
they in turn got in communication with
other officers of thje guard. The local
| militia always maintains what is
I termed a "rapid assembly roster." bv
which one officer is informed of a mobilization
order, he in turn passing it to
two of his men. and they pass it to two
each, and so in fanlike fashion the order
spreads until every man of the
command is reached. The order spread
over Washington like wildfire last
night, those men who had telephones
being informed over the wire. They
were instructed to assemble Tuesday
morning.
Shortly after 9 o'clock today a special
messenger from the War Department
brought the official orders under
which the guard is mobilizing. There
was little in addition to what was told
Gen. Harvey last night, and the machinery
for carrying them into effect
was well in motion when they came.
With all plans virtually completed,
there is little for the officers and men
now to do but sit around and wait for
the order to "forward march," except,
of course, enlistinsr recruits and raftlnr
them properly outfitted before tbey
leave wltb tbe troope tomorrow mornIns.
The aolored troope are moblllstns at

RESTSJWTH LATINS
First Chief Must Turn Forces
Against Bandits Instead of
Americans.
CALLING OUT OF TROOPS
A SAFETY FIRST MEASURE
Intervention Regarded as Natural
Consequence of Hostilities by
Officials of the Administration.
War with Mexico, and consequent
intervention, rests wholly
with stubborn Gen. Carranza
and the Mexicans.
With President Wilson it is
again a question of doing his
duty as he sees it, believing the j
country recognizes it, and leaving
what follows to the Mexicans.
The President's most intimate
friends today declare that Mr.
Wilson no more wants trouble
with Mexico than he wanted it
with Germany, but that events
| are forcing him, as the head of
!the country, immediately to get
ready for hostile action on the
part of the Mexicans.
Militia Warning to Carranza.
The calling of the National Guard of
the country is intended by the administration
as a warning to Carranza that
the United States wiil be prepared as
riv a noKftihia for whatever trouble!
may come; as a hint that the ^fexicans j
hgd better not so further in their threats
against the troops below the border, now
there only because*, the United states was
compelled to send them as a protection
against the bandits who were raiding
American territory, killing Americans and
destroying American property.
The administration attitude is that if
the Mexicans will sincerely and honestly
turn their armed forces against the
bandits, instead of encouraging and
shielding them, the presence of United
States troops on Mexican soil will
shortly be no longer necessary, but
that in view of the horrible experiences
in the past, and the supineness of Mexican
officials generally, it is impossible
now to make withdrawal.
The word of the United States was
passed that the expedition into Mexico
was not intended for conquest of territory
nor interference in political or
other fields in that nation. The sincerity
of the United States is still not
to be questioned. Should Mexican authorities
and officials, in the face of
this known position of the government,
bring war and intervention, the fault
is theirs.
Im Withheld the Iron Hand.
It was declared again today by Intimate
friends of Mr. Wilson that before
he took the oath of office as President
his mind was made up on Mexico. It
was that he would endeavor to hold
hands off and to the last attempt to
prevent the loss of American lives such
as will follow a clash of arms between
the two countries. Although sorely
tempted to apply the iron hand he repeatedly
refrained from intervention.
Even now he will seek to appease the
Mexicans and avert the thunder of cannon
and roar of guns along the border.
Calling out the National Guard is a
safety-first act that may or inay not
bring Carranza and Mexicans generally
to a thoughtful consideration of the
wisdom of restraining the hot heads
who are arousing Mexican passion
south of the border.
The administration has eome hope
that fighting may be averted, but the
hope is growing weaker every day.
All reports from Mexico and the border
say that the Mexicans generally
are being aroused into frenzy, and that
they are everywhere shouting vengeance
against the United States. It
now looks almost impossible to allay
this ill-timed passion, and any day an
attack may be made upon troope of
the United State* that will caat the
die tor .war and the military occupation
of a large part of Mexico.
Mexicans in Frenzy of Hatred.
Official reports Indicate that the Mexicans
are not only aroused to a frenzy
of hatred, but that they are also egotistical
as to what they can do against
the military forces of this country.
Their - leaders talk about overrunning
the United States and obtaining great
wealth and territory. They believe
themselves equipped for a long conflict.
Will Carranza be able to check
them?
The White House today refrained
from comment as to the situation. The
does not want anythlna said
or don? that will fan tha Aamu of paeelon
below the border. He will not take
a backward step now aa to withdrawal,
but he will not permit anything to be
aald that wtll offend Mexican pride.
Not a aingle man talked Mexico with
the Preatdent up to the time of hla
luncheon hour. He received a number
of vialtora, but purpoaely kept off

Exchange of Shots.
WASHINGTON ACTIVITIES
DEAL WITH THE CRISIS
President Wilson's Note Refusing to
Withdraw Troops Goes to Carranza
Today.
Robert Lansing, Secretary ot
State, allowed it to become
known today, in regard to the
general situation as to Mexican
affairs, that dispatches to the department
show that there is increasing
excitement below the
border and irritation against
Americans.
On the heels of these dispatches came
reports from Mexican sources in which
it is admitted that another international
incident has occurred, in which there
was an exchange of shots at Mazatlan
and the arrest by Mexicans of two
American naval officers, who were held
until explanations has been made. This
followed an attempt to land marines
from a warship, and the Mexican mill- 4
tary commander at Mazatlan, acting
upon instructions from the Carranza
foreign office, is urging that Americans
be kept aboard their ships.
Byes of U. S. Focussed.
This and othnr developments all
over the country,'as well as throughout
Washington*; the capital, serve to
foOus the eyes of the United States
upon what is going on along and below
the border. Various activities
came into play today in connection
with the general situation following 1
the call to the colors last night of
more than 100,000 members of tho Na- ^
tional Guard through*, ut the country
to assist in guarding the border, and 1
the talk of intervention in Mexico,
heard for so long under the surface,
tame" to the top today with a bang.
Many senators and representatives, republicans
as well as democrats, ex- ;
pressed themselves today in interviews
printed elsewhere in The Star, as ap- (
proving rresiaent wiwon s step ana as
believing: intervention necessary.
A resolution making: effective the
militia draft provisidn of the new army i
organization bill, under which National
Guardsmen consenting to take !
the federal oath would be available for
service anywhere immediately, has Hfeen )
prepared by War De. artment officials
and Chairman Hay of the House military
committee. It will be introduced
In the House at once. J
Congress granted the War Department
liberal emergency funds because
of the border situation some time ago.
and there were indications today that
arrangements will at once be made to ,
defray the expenses of the National '
Guard and maintaining it, under emergency
appropriations.
Intervene, Says Chamberlain.
Chairmen Chamberlain and Hay of
the Senate and House military com
mittee were summoned to the White
House early in the day for a conference,
and Senator Chamberlain said: 1
"I have felt all along: that we would
be forced to intervene. The Mexican
people, so largely ignorant, have a
notion that they can whip us, and it
will be necessary for us to go in and
clean up the situation." ,
On the other hand, government officials
carefully pointed out today that
President Wilson's policy as to Mexico
Is unchanged, although In calling out
the National Guard he has taken the
last possible step short of intervention.
American troops, it is declared at the
State Department, are to be em
ployed to defend the border and
for that purpose only. This, it is
pointed out, has been affirmed over and
over again by President Wilson, and
has only just been affirmed by the
democratic platform upon which President
Wilson will se?& re-election. Stress
is laid upon the fact that if hostilities
between the two countries follow it
I will be as a result only of acts of Carranza
or other Mexican officials.
Reply to Carr&nza Today.
While the whole country was astir
today with/the mobiliation of the Na- ,
tional Guard, President Wilson directed ]
that his reply to Gen. Carranza's note
demanding recall of American troops ]
from Mexico go forward immediately, i
In refusing to wk draw the troops, in |
this note, the Uniul States reaffirms j
the friendly intentions of the United i
States toward the de facto government
in Mexico, and sharply rebukes Gen.
Carranza for unwarranted charges and 1
insinuations of bad faith contained in '
his communication.
President Wilson's firm resolve to
keep the armed forces of the United
States in Mexico until such time as the
Mexican de facto government polices
the border region so thoroughly that
bandit raids into Ameriqan territory i
are improbable is understood to be
clearly stated in the note. Whether ?
the suggestion of the democratic plat- <
form plank that intervention might
be undertaken as a last resort also
was communicated to Gen. Carranza is
not known.
Secretary Lansing announced that the
note would be forwarded today. There
were Indications that the reply, might
go by cable or telegraph to Special
Agent Rodgers of the State Department,
who is stationed in Mexico City, for
delivery to Gen. Carranza. It is understood
to be 8,000 or 10,000 words in length
and Secretary Lansing indicated that
its text might be made public tonight.
