With a view to introducing better
methods of hog raising and better
breeds of hogs, with the ultimate ob
ject of bringing about the raising of
one breed and standardizing it, a
boy's pig club is to be started in Mar
ion county under the direction of R.
W. Blacklock, demonstration agent,

pose, prorating this amount according

To be eligible for membership in

will undertake pig raising. The breed
of hog to be used has not yet been
decided on. A registered bred gilt
will be bought and sold at cost to
each boy, who will be required to give
his notes. He will be given 12 months
in which to pay for the gilt, and will
be charged 6 per cent interest.
Each pig club boy will be required
to exhibit at the county fair,- and
will have a special space, and in con
nection with the boy's pigs the county
demonstration agent will arrange a
general propaganda exhibit.
The following rules have been
agreed on for the club: ,
1. To be eligible for membership
in the Banker's Pig Club a boy must
be a member of . the Marion County
Corn Club in good standing.
2. The member must; agree to
care for the pig under the direction
of the county agent and if he fails to
do so or neglects the p"g so as to im
pair its value to deliver same over to
county agent upon the return of his
note. - -
3. The member must care for his
pig in person and must keep a record
of his work. ,
4. The member is to exhibit his
pig at the county fair.
5. The member is to be sold his
pig at actual cost and is to give his
personal note without any endorse
ment. He is to be given twelve
months in which to , pay and will be
charged 6 per cent from time of re
ceiving the pig.

MORE TROUBLE FOR r""f
DR. MONTGOMERY
A telegram this morning from Dr.
Montgomery of Micanopy to one of
his friends in this city said that the
doctor was in jail in Gainesville,
where he had been placed by the sher
iff of Alachua county without any
warrant. The friend was requested
to go to Gainesville and help bail the
doctor out. It added that he was
shot at while sitting on his piazza
yesterday evening, that shot going too
high, i v-; ,
An Ocala chauffeur who was in
Micanopy this morning said Dr. Mont
gomery's office there was vacant and
ocked up, but shot full of holes.
It has been understood for some
tice that a couple of Alachua county
men are after Dr. Montgomery with
guns. If Sheriff Ramsey locked
Montgomery up, it was probably with
the desire of saving his life.
At His Mother's Request
A telephone message from Gaines
ville this afternoon gave the informa
tion that Dr. Montgomery had been
ocked up in the jail in that city at
the request of his mother. It appears
that Dr. Montgomery's mother refus
ed him a sum of money, and he
threatened to choke her to death, and
for this reason she asked that he be
ocked up.

OCALA RIFLES
Boys in Khaki Called to Join Uncle
Sam's Regulars on the
Mexican Border
A little before 8 o'clock Sunday
night, a- Western Union messenger
boy came into the Star office with an
Associated Press telegram, announc
ing that the National Guard of all
the states had been called out for
duty on the Mexican border.
The Star at once notified all the of
ficers and members of the Ocala
Rifles who could be reached by phone,
and judging i by the remarks they
made on receiving the news they
were ready and willing to go.
Captain Edward Drake said this
morning that his company, if called,
would be ready to move immediately
that transportation and several other
matters are attended to. V
The enlisted strength of the
Rifles is at present 63 men, with 65
the number of men required for
mustering into the, federal service.
There are four men on the waiting
list No difficulty will be, experienc
ed, therefore, in enlisting the 65. In
the event that the company is called,
R. L. Marsh, second lieutenant, will
remain at headquarters here to re
cruit up to the full war strength, and
he will join the company at what
ever point it happens to be.
There has been some talk of a
"home guard" to take the place of
the Rifles. Any civilian can organize
such a body of men, and apply for en
rollment as state militia.
At 10:38- o'clock Captain Fred
Weihe, commanding this post of the
National Guard of Florida, received a
telegram from Adjutant General J.
Clifford R. Foster, giving instructions
to hold the Rifles in readiness for call
into federal service and to recruit to
full war strength of 150 men. Captain
Weihe immediately acknowledged the
message, and told a representative of
the Star that the members of his
company would immediately be com
municated with. All equipment will
be held at the armory in order that
the men may be made, ready to move
at a moment's notice.
The telegram from the adjutant
general reads:.
"You will hold your command in
readiness for call into federal service.
Detailed instructions will fojlow. Con
sult paragraphs 450 to 463 inclusive
U. S. army regulations, and state
general order No. 43, series 1911.
Recruiting officers designated under
the latter order may at once com
mence to enroll to war strength, but
no enlistments or re-enlistments will
be made until receipt of new enlist
ment forms, which go forward by
mail. Acknowledge."-' -
The roster of the Rifles as at pres
ent enlisted is as follows:
Captain F. E. Weihe, post com

SOME DIFFERENCE
The enlistment forms spoken of in
the telegram received by Captain
Weihe from Adjutant General Foster
did not arrive on the Seaboard mail
at 12:40, but will probably arrive on
a later train this afternoon.
When the morning papers from
Tampa and Jacksonville reached the
city it was noted that President Wil
son's call was for the peace strength,
with Florida's quota one regiment.
The message from Adjutant General
Foster gave instructions for recruit
ing the Rifles to war strength.
THE STAR TOLD THE3I
A few minutes after the dispatch
came Sunday night, telling that the
national guard had been called out,
and the Star had passed the word to
those most interested, the news per
colated out in town, and for the next
hour the Star's phone was kept busy
answering calls from people who
wanted the news. It's some advantage
to a town to have a paper carrying
Associated Press dispatches in it.
