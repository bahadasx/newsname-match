THE WAR TODAY
German attacks on French posi
tions north of Verdun have been
resumed hut the crown prince's
forces have been prevented from
making any further advance. The
Paris war office announced today.
The assault of last night was on
hill 321, west of the Thiaiimont
farm, almost directly north of the
fortress. A further attack in force
In the Dead Man's Hill sector, west
cf the Meuse, apparently is in
preparation, judirinc from Hie in
tensity of the German bombard
ment and its prolongation.
Correspondents on the eastern
front point to the lighting along
the Sljr and Stokhod, near kolki,
as crucial in its nature. The Ger
mans are assisting the Austrians
there in an attempt to check the
determined drive of the Hiissians
for the railway junction at Hovel,
a vital point in the Teutonic de
fensive system in that region.
The Russians are now in full
possession of t'zernowitz, capital
of Itukowina, the Austrians having
evacuated the city, leaving 1,000
prisoners and some guns in tho
hands of the Russians.
In (ialicia and Tolhynia, the
Russians are meeting with strong
resistance from the Austro.Hun
garians and Ormans, some of the
latter of whom are declared hy
I'etroerad to have been brought
from the French front in an en
deavor to aid in stopping the Rus
sian advance.
Petrograd asserts that the Rus
sians are repulsing counter attacks
and pressing back the Teutonic
allies at the same time taking
large numbers of prisoners and
quantities of war supplies, but the
Austrians and Germans claim vie
tones for their arms in Galicia and
Volhjnia. The (Germans say they
captured about 1,000 prisoners
along the Styr river.
Around Verdun in the vicinity
of Le Mort Homme, the Germans
suffered heavy casualties in sev
eral attacks. In the Argonne for
est there is much activity and the
French claim to have used their
long range artillery effectively.
On the French front there has
been renewed fighting in the air,
the British bringing down one and
the French seven German ma
chines. The French lost one ma
chine. The Austrians have not yet with
drawn troops from the Italian
frontier because of the Russian of
fensive and they are continuing
their efforts to break through the
Italian line but wlthont success,
the attacks being pat down hy the
Italians with heavy casualties.

CALL ISSUED BY WILSON
Washington, June 19.-
Not since the
Spanish-American war has the nation
seen such military activity as today.
More than 100,000 national guards
men in 45 states are under orders to
mobilize for Mexican service. Thev
constitute virtually the entire militia
strength of the United States. Presi
dent Wilson, through Secretary Baker,
issued the orders yesterday when it be
came apparent that the threatening
conditions in northern Mexico were
not improving.
Only drilling and recruiting will be
in order among militia organizations
for the present. All must be mustered
into federal service. Later they will
sent sent to the border on patrol duty,
thus releasing about thirty thousand
regulars for service in Mexico if war
actually develops. Additional warships
also are being made ready today to
hurry 6outh to stand by Mexican ports
to protect Americans. Secretary Dan
iels, after the militia order was issued
last night ordered seven destroyers
and nine other small vessels to join
the American warships already iu

contemplated. President Wilson only
wanta stronger forces to defend the
border againBt bandit raids and to be
prepared should Carranza troops carry
out their threats to Btrike at American
forces engaged in chasing bandits
south of the border.

Military Strength of State Concentrating at Springfield;
to Be Held in Read iness for It to Be
Dispatched to the Line. , ,
San Antonio, Tex., June 19. It was indicated at
headquarters of the southern department today that
General Funston would request the war department to
send him first the militia of New York, Pennsylvania and
Illinois. The designation of militia units for service along
the Mexican border will be made by the war department
but it was pointed out that General Funston believed he
could make practical use immediately of the organiza
tions from those states. He and his staff were quite
content that the work of organizing and equipping the
militia, especially that from most of the states be done at
home stations and many of the officers here who wit
nessed the work of getting the guardsmen of Texas, New
Mexico and Arizona into shape, expressed the hope that
none would be sent south until they had been drilled for
a time and made partially fit at least for service in the
field. "
General Funston and his staff were chiefly concerned
today in a study how best to maintain the delicate bal
ance between the United States and Mexico until the
militia organizations began to arrive. Officers at de
partment headquarters believed it improbable that any
of the state troops would get to border stations before 10
days and that even then only a small percentage of the
total expected would be available for service.

w York Society Shows Willingness
to Help Government in MesJco
Crisis.
New York, June 19. The Aero club
of America announced today that it
would do all in its power to aid the
United States government in the Mex
ican crisis by providing aeroplanes and
aviators for patrol work.
Alan R. Hawley, president of the
club, telegraphed to Washington that
some of the 30 national guard officers
sent to aviation schools at the expedi
tions of the national aeroplane fund
are ready to pass the tests for avia
tors' certificates. Many of them, he
said, need only a few weeks' training
at the army aviation schools to make
them suitable military aviators.
mobilization and about 50,000 troops
already at the border, the United
States' reply to General Carranza's
last note demanding withdrawal of
American troops is ready to go for
ward. It announces a refusal to with
draw until Mexico curbs its own ban
dits and it is emphatic,
Mobilize M ith Zest.
Unofficial reports received here to
day indicated that national guardsmen
are mobilizing with a zest. In each
state and the District of Columbia they
are preparing to meet in a single con
centration camp, where they will drill
pending further orders from the war
department. Most units will have to
recruit up to the minimum standards
required by the government.
Infantry, cavalry, artillery, signal
and sanitary troops are included in the
call. Only coast guards militia is not
being mobilized. Texas, New Mexico
and Arizona guardsmen are already
at the border under call issued sev
eral weeks ago.
Fnnston In Complete Charge.
General Funston. commanding the
border forces, will determine when the
militia organizations shall be dis
patched from their home states and to
what points along the border.
While these troops were getting
ready today, war department officials
were awaiting anxiously news ot
whether Major Anderson's squadron
of cavalry was attacked by Carranza
soldiers during a successful bandit
chase south of the Rio Grande Saturday.
SUillONS,
Reports from the border early
today told of no new raids. Anti
Anierican demonstrations took
place yesterday in Mexican towns
and the feeling generally through
out the frontier was that Car.
ranza's troops or civilian organ
ization in Mexico might precipi
tate a clash but extreme caution
was taken because American offl
cers along the line and by Gen
eral Pershing not to giTe cause
for aggression.
If another raid docs occur or If
General Trevino permits any of his
troops to attack General Persh
ing's lines, swift action will be
taken by the Americans, but if
there is anything the Americans
can do to avert trouble it will be
done.
General Fnnston lias not worked
out the details of stations for the
state troops, but before they can
get here it will be known definitely
where each unit will go and jnst
what detachment of regular troops
will be relieved. Very few of the
regiments of the regular forces
now covering the border are intact
hut it is expected that the avail
ability of the militia will make pos
sible the drawing together of scat
tered details so every regiment
may be moTed as a whole.
Springfield, 111., June 19 The first
Illinois troops under arms at the mob
ilization point was company H, Eighth
infantry (colored). Company H is sta
tioned here and was under orders to
I proceed to the fair grounds this after
noon to police the grounds.
The First cavalry and the two bat
talions of field artillery are to be mob
ilized at Camp Lincoln. All other or
ganizations are to go into camp at the
state fair grounds. Civilian employes
of the quartermasters' headquarters
were busy getting up tentage, direct
ing the installation of telephones and
shower baths. Storing supplies of the
quartermaster and commissary depart
ments. At the arsenal orders were being
filled for additional equipment for re
cruits being added to the various or
ganizations. Wagons which have bn
stored in the basement of the arsenal
were being assembled and will be
ready before dark, with the necessary
waggoners and mules of the army ty-pe
to meet incoming outfits and to take
impedimenta to camp.
Asked when the troops would begin
arriving, General Dickson said: "Cer
tainly by tomorrow. We want thm
to get here in good shape rather than
in a great hurry." General Dickson
said he was absolutely in tho dark as
to the length of time the troops would
be kept here before being sent to the
border. It was generally understood
this was a question of the efficiency
of the various organizations.
Equipment Being Sashed.
Kight freight car loads of camp
equipment were being rushed back to
Springfield today from Fort Sheridan
in charge of Captain A. 1. Simmons, de
tailed as quartermaster at the aban
doned summer camp of instruction
there. This was the first train move
