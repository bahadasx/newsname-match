Weed and Medford
Will Play Ball Here
"Chl" rierson returiiorl Monday
from an extended automobile trip
through northern California and re
ports that everywhere interest In the
Ashland celebration Is growing by
leaps and bounds. He says that the
little town of Etna Mills, forty miles
from the railroad, will send one hun
dred and fifty.
Mr. Pierson is In charge of the
baseball concession for the three big
days and has signed up the Weed
and Medford teams. These two
tpams seem to be probably the
strongest within a radius of three
hundred miles of Ashland, with the
possible exception of Klamath Falls.
Medford plays Klamath before the
Fourth, however, so a basis for com
parison may be formed.
The Medford team is playing great
ball this year. They are reinforced
by several college men and have not
been defeated. Weed has a team
which would make the best of the
hush league teams hump. Several
Stanford and Oregon players are In
cluded In their lineup. Kenneth
Lilly, Ashland boy who Is develop
ing into a promising ballplayer, Is
one of the mainstays of the Weed ag
gregation with the bat.
The games will be played promptly
at 10 o'clock on each morning of
the 4th, Hth and 6th. The parade
will start at 9 and end at the ball
grounds. The high school grounds
will be put Into shape and additional
bleachers built.
"Big Bill" Tuerck, the University
of Oregon's mainstay in the pitcher's
box, has joined the Weed team, to
gether with Sheehy of the same team.
Medford boasts of the fastest Infield
in the history of baseball in that
city and points with pride to Deputy
Sheriff Curly Wilson, who pinches
everything that comes within the
ne'ghborhood of first base; Shorty
Miles, chubby veteran who has ca
vorted around second since time im
memorial; Rudy Sholtz, star athlete
of the Santa Clara baseball team at
short, and a speed demon by the
name of Moran on third. They will
holster up their outfield with two
heavy hitters, one Jud Pernoll of
Grants Pass, who has done his little
turn on the mound up In the Ameri
can league and may be persuaded to
go into the box in one of the games,
and an extra pitcher. The games will
be the best baseball ever put up in
Ashland and should draw immense
crowds. The entire Weed lumber
force will be over to root for their
team.
Vining Offerings
For the Week
Monday.
Tonight's bill at the Vining brings
a Metro feature, "Her Great Price,"
featuring Mabel Taliaferro. The fea
ture Is in five great acts of thrilling
moments, intense situations, spark
ling comedy and culminates with a
genuine surprise in a startling cli
max. It is a typical Bohemian story
vividly reminding the spectators of
an O. Henry story, and is one of the
most nevel pictures recently released
Tuesday.
"He Fell In Love With HIb Wife"
is, as the title suggests, a story of
heart interest supreme. Florence
Rockwell and Forrest Stanley play
the lead parts in this play of excep
tional appeal. As an extraordinary
feature, fifty votes for King Sulphur
will be given away with every adult
admission to the Vining Theatre
Tuesday evening.
Wednesday.
Hall Caine Is the author of a won
derful feature production, "The
Bondman," featuring the great Wil
Fam Farnum, which comes to tho
Vining Theatre and will attract a ca
pacity crowd on Wednesday night of
this week. Hall Caine has penned
many a brilliant story, but surpasses
himself in this big dramatic success,
pregnant with compellant power and
lifting the audience out of their seats
with its supreme dramatic climaxes.
William Farnum is at his best in the
character of the wrestling champion
of Iceland who falls in love with the
Kovernor's daughter, marries her over
hitter opposition, deserts her, and so
on through a primeval story of
strength and the vast places to a su
preme climax.
Samuel G. Blythe tells us that "ex
aggerated ego" is a "national fail
ing" in Mexico. So different in this
country.

TO C. It. WOLF AM) If. (i.
KXDKICS.
Among other misleading
statements and villainous In
sinuations against the acts of
the springs water commission,
and Mr. Greer !n particular, you
query as to why the commission
does not sue Smith, Kmery &
Co. on their $',0,000 bond. The
reply Is simply because no such
condition as you intimate ex
ists. You are doing your best to
create the suspicion in the pub
lic mind that Bert R. Greer has
grafted in the springs matter.
If this be true, and you have
any evidence, why do you not
sue Greer on his $10,000 bond
and make him como back with
the money? If you are honest
you should apply the same rem
edy to protect the city against
peculations by Greer that you
ask the commission to apply to
Smith, Emery & Co.
The truth Is, gentlemen, you
are purposely misrepresenting
the facts and you know it. You
are simply ins'nuating in the
hope of turning the people
against Greer in the recall elec

! ures of preparation anticipating or
( ders for mobilization of the Oregon
j militia were received yesterday, and
the Ashland company is in readiness
to get under way within twenty hours
should mobilization orders, which are
I expected hourly, arrive. Rumors
were prevalent yesterday on the
j streets that the Medford company had
' been ordered to Me::ieo and the Ash

be learned at present, the move con
: templated is a mobilization of the
militia of the state at Clackamas.
The local company would probably go
into service relieving the regulars at
Fort Stevens, should the call come.
The news was received with but
little excitement except among the
younger members of the company.
Illumination Makes Park
Night Vision of Beauty
I Lithia Park at night has been
1 transformed from a place of fearsome
I pitch dark paths whose pitfalls
'caught the feet of the seeker for lithia
! water, into a veritable fairyland of
j beauty. Hundreds of electric lamps,
scattered as if strewn by a comet
shower among the trees of the park,
male Lithia park a land of enchant-
ment whose night beauty will soon
draw larger crowds than its daylight
attractions.
The illumination of Lithia Park
was the last act of the springs water
I commission prior to turning over the
' park to the park board of the city on
June 15.
The path through Chautauqua
' Park, the main foot entrance to
Lithia Park, has been lighted by
strings of bulbs hung from the trees,
and Park avenue is illuminated witn
high-power street lights. This part
of the lighting system Is simply utili
tarian and will be accepted by the
visitor as a matter of course, but
when Lithia Park conies into view a
gasp of wonder is elicited from even
an offset which is simply indescrib
able. The great tree is of no color
which can be named; it evokes re-
mombrance of nothing unless it be
that of a single cloud high in the sky
which 8hi!iimer9 witn ""might as twi-

well. All of the lamps are strung
among the trees, and neither at night
nor during the day are the wires visi
ble, so cleverly was the work done.
Charming scenes are revealed by tho
illumination arrangement, night pic
tures of tumbling waters and stately
trees fringed by the shadows which
always approach but never envelop.
And soon as the trails along the
creek are followed, blue lights ahead
announce that the visitor Is approach
ing Satan's Sulphur Grotto. A red
radipneo is thrown out apparently
from the hillside, but upon nearer
approach Is seen to come from the
depths of a cave which punctures the
hillside. Mingling with the flood of
red, flaniellke Illumination como the
fumes of sulphur, and imagination
pictures the cave to be watched over
by a giant Satan. The sulphur cave
is the feature of the new park which
has perhaps caused the most comment
of any, and the Sulphur Grotto at
night, with the uncanny lighting ar
rangement, conies nearer affording a
semblance of a visit to the bowels of
the earth than seems possible.
Just beyond Satan's Grotto tho vis
itor bursts upon the triumph of the
electricians. A brilliant sheen of
flashing water spurting out of a
granite cliff tumbles over tho moss
grown rocks iu an effervescent, lum
inous refulgence of beauty. Liko tho
tree, tno rails at night must no seen
to be appreciated. The offect is
gained by Indirect floods of light
from giant searchlights, but that an
effect of such indescribablo beauty
can be gained by purely mechanical
means beggars description. The
great wall of granite, the tumbling
falls, take on a silvery, scintillating
resplendence ,of concentrated moon
light and floods of diamonds.
Lithia Park at night offers an un
explored world to Ashland and to the
valley. No matter if you have ex
ployer every nook and cranny of the
park under the sunlight, the wond
drous beauty of the park at night
transforms the familiar places into
little bits of fairyland. Go up to
night. Lithia Park is well lighted. All
