BAKER URGES EARLY
ACTION ON MATTER
By Time Militia is Mobilized
Steps For Entering Mex

pleted. Iiiteni vtien;d News SerTie:
WASHINCT' N, June l'a. The
administration today arranged with
c o n g re s s i n a 1 leaders specifically t
authorize' the us of the organized
militia as an offensive force on Mex
ican soil.
Sec'y d' War l'.aker communi
cated to Chairman Hay of the house
military affairs committee, and
Chairman Chamberlain, of the sen
ate committee, the desire for spe
cific congressional action that would
make clear the authority of
the department to send the militia
men outside the borders of the
Cnited States and into Mexico as a
defensive measure, assured Sec'y
l'.aker that authorization would be
promptly forthcoming. By tlie time
the militia has been mobilized on
the border all legal action necessary
to make them available for federal
service anywhere in Mexico will
have been taken.
Some ()pHiioii.
Some administration advi-ers op
posed the specific authorizing1 sug
gested by Sec'y liaker, declaring it
would be accepted by the Mexican
people as a flat declaration of war.
They asserted that while it would
add nothing to the actual authority
which the piesident now has over
the militia, it might operate to
force hostilities hy the Mexicans by
spreading the idea that the Cnited
States was bent on war. Sec'y
l'.aker tedd them, however, that this
matter had been considered and
that the administration believed the
passage of such legislation would
md further complicate the situation.
Chairiiian Hay. after talking with
Sec'y l'.aker over the telephone, said
that a joint resolution sjiecitically
authorizing tlie president to use the
militia outside of the territorial lim
its of the Cnited States would he in
troduced and put through both
hoi.se of coi:invss to meet Sec'y
biker's demands.
NtHMl. Mom poxwr.
"The war depaitment seems to
think." said Hep. Hay. "that under
the law the president nee. Is special
sp iJie- e tuiizre sioual authorization
in older to legalize th use of the
militia organizations outside- the
boundaries of the Cnited States.
See'y l'.aker has su;:neted th' pas-sa-
of a joint resolution atrying
this authorization. Such a resolu
tion will he passed and will un
doubtedly have the unanimous sap
port of the members of both houses,
since the adn.lnist ration beiieve.. it
uecessarx. IVrsonallv I believe the
administration has the authority t
send the militia anywhere in Mex
itil at pre-.-e'iit. It i certain that
we e-oubl -end a militia army into
Mexico as a mean- of defense, as
a means of lepeliim; invasion. The
passage of the Miirgested joint reso
lution, however, vvill make the mat
ter clear be ond all pOssihilitx ef

The Mexicans further have the ad

of knowing ev er y im h of soil in nor-the-rn

Citizens living in Fnited States
