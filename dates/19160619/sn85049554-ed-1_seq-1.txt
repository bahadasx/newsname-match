First Newe of Trouble in Mszstlsn.
The embassy communication today1
brought the Washington government
its tlrst news of trouble at Mazatlan.
According to the Mexican version

marlnos from a warship. The embassy
presented a report from tho military
commander at Mazutlan, General Mezto,
telling of the Incident, accompanied by
instructions advising that the Amer
icans be kept aboard their ship.
Jsp Starts Trouble.
The message said the men landed a!
Mazatlan were marines but 'as the
gunboat Annapolis has no marines,
aboard it is presumed that bluejackets
were involved. The report told this,
story:
A boat from the warship approached
a wharf and was warned to keep oft
until permission to land could be ob
tained from military authorities. It'
went back to the ship and several^
hours later returned with its creW|
armed.
Tho officer In command was told
permission for landing had not been
given. A crowd of soldiers and civilians
had gathered and in the midst of the
discussion a drunken Japanese fired a
shot at the Americans, Who promptly
replied with a volley Into the crowd,
Carranza soldiers returned the fire anft
the boat withdrew, leaving behind two'
officers who were arrested.
Explanations followed and the Amerv\
lean officers were released.
The report says two Mexican sol*
dierg and one civilian were wounded.
No Shore Liberty Allowed.
Later a formal request from Car-'
ranza wa6 transmitted, urging that no
men from American warships be per
mitted to land,. even unarmed, during
the present disturbed' state of publio
opinion. 'h
Admiral Winslow Is trying to reacts
the Annapolis by radio for a report
on the incident.
Instructions to naval commanders In
Mexican waters have been to allow no
shore liberty to their men and to send
only such men ashore as Is necessary
to get supplies and mall.
