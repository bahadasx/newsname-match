Washington, June 19.—While the whole country was astir to

Just a Reminder
Before you start on your vaca
tion, don't forgot to order the ;iar
llsburg Telegraph mailed to your
vacation address You will want
to know what's doing—you don't
want to come back ignorant of
everything worth while that's hap
pened during your absence.
Drop a postal or call the Circu
lation Department.
I bandit raids into American territory
are improbable is understood to be
i clearly stated in the note. Whether
the suggestton of the Democratic plat
form plank that intervention might be
I undertaken as a last resort also was
communicated is not known.
Secretary Lansing announced that i
the note would be dispatched during !
the day but would ;not discuss its
terms or say how it would be trans- i
mitted. It had been planned to send !
it by special messenger to the Mexican
capital following the precedent set by
General Carranza in transmitting his
own demands. Recent developments
along the border and General Tre
vino's warning to General Pershing,
however, caused the wisdom of the
plan to be doubted and there were in
dications to-day that the reply would
go by telegraph to Special Agent Rod- I
gers in Mexico City for delivery to
General Carranza. Mr. Lansing inti
mated that its text might be made
public here to-night.
Mustering 100,000 Guardsmen
While these diplomatic steps were
in process, a force of national guards-
I men which will not be less than 100,- 1
, 000 strong and may exceed that num
ber by many thousands was being
I mustered into the service of the
I United States. Governors of all States
: had replied before noon to-day to in
structions sent last night that their
I allotment or troops be immediately
| called out. In each instance, Secre
| tary Baker was informed that the or
ders had been given and the men were
arming and proceeding to their State
mobilization points.
From both coasts, also, additional
naval vessels were under orders to
proceed to Mexican waters for the re
lief of Americans who may gather
from the intetior. Light craft and
transports are only engaged in this
service. If necessary they will be

Funston Wants Penna.,

Guardsmen Immediately
I San Antonio, Texas, j_ne 19. —lt
1 was indicated at headquarters of the
j southern department to-day that Gen
eral Funston would request the War
| Department to send him first the mili
tia of New York, Pennsylvania and Il
linois as he believed he can
practical use immediately of these or
ganizations
Officers here, who witnessed the
work of getting the guardsmen of
Texas. New Mexico and Arizona into
shape, expressed the hope that none
of State .troops would be sent south
until they had been drilled for a time
and made partially fit for field ser
vice.
Genera! Funston and his staff were
chiefly concerned to-day in a study of
how best to maintain the delicate bal
ance between the United States and
[Mexico until militia organizations ar
! rive. Officers at department head
quarters do not believe that any of
| the State troops will get to border sta
tions before ten days and that even
' then only a small percentage of the
total expected would be available for
service.
Reports from the border to-day told
l of no new raids. Anti-American dem
onstrations took place yesterday in
: Mexican towns and the feeling gener
ally throughout the frontier was that
I Carranza's troops or civilian organi
zation in Mexioo might precipitate a
j clash, but extreme caution was taken
. by American Officers not to give cause
| for aggression.

RIVER FRONT SITUATION
CONDITIONS along the River
Front wore serious enough to de- j
mand ergo tic treatment before
Ihe unexpected deluge that Is now
sweeping through the valley of the
Susquehanna, but the damage that has
resulted from the present flood makes <
Imperative broad and generous con- \
sjderation of the whole question by !
C ity Council. No time Is to be lost.
Harrisburg people and thousands of
appreciative visit brs have learned to
regard the Susquehanna Basin and the
One treatment of the River Front as
the city's most famous asset. It is
talked about wherever natural charm
makes an appeal.
Thousands of our people crowded
the parks along the river yesterday
and these expressed universal regret
that so much damage had followed
the unusual Hood at this season. With
one voice those wno discussed the sit
uation favored immediate action to
complete the permanent protection of
the slope a reasonable distance above
the granolithic walk in accordance
with the plan outlined by Farl®.v Gan
nett. the consulting engineer, who has
generously volunteered the services of
his Arm at this critical jupeture.
City Council should take de'finite
action in this emergency so that no
time shall be lost, in doing what is
necessary in the way of riprapping the
lower sections of the slope, grading
the upper walk anil planting hardy
shrubbery so that the high water here
after may do little damage.
Meanwhile City Commissioner Gross
will have the sympathy of the public
in running down and making examples
of the malicious bojs who still imagine
the big frosted globe:; on the standards
along the "front steps' arc proper tar
gets for their destructive energies. It
was bad enough yesterday to see drift
wood lodge against the standards and
threaten their stability; it was worse,
however, to see boys stoning the globes
in full view of everybody.
City Council has a definite duty to
perform and the mutter of providing
funds to protect the city's large invest
ment along the river ought to have
serious and immediate consideration.
