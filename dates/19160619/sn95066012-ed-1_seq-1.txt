EVACUATION OF
CZERN0W1TZ
t
Capital of Bukowina Occupied by
Russians on Sunday
RUSSIANS LOSE IN VOLHYMIA
Austrians Gain Ground North of the
Lipa and Capture Both Prisoners
and Machine Guns
London, June 19. The evacuation
of Czernowitz by tho Austrians after
the Russians had forced the passage
of the Truth and penetrated the city
was announced by the war office at
Vienna. "Yesterday," says the e-Hicial
statement, "the garrison of the bridge
head at Czernowitz withdrew before
superior enemy fire. During the night
the enemy at several points forced a
passage of the Truth and penetrated
Czernowitz, which we evacuated."
The capture by the Russians of
Czernowitz, capital of the Austro
Jlungarian crown land of Hukowina,
was olllchilly announced at Tetrograd
yesterday by the Russian war office.
A dispatch from Vienna, by way of
London, at 8.17 p. ni., says that the
Austrian ollicial statement claims the
repulse of Russian counter-attacks in
Volhynla and the gaining of ground
north of the Lipa, with tho capture of
900 Russian prisoners and three ma
chine guns. It reports the Germans
successful north of Torya, where 11
Russian oflicers, 344G men, one gun
and 10 machine guns were taken, Rus
sian attacks between Sokul anil Kolki
are declared to have been repulsed.
A Reuter dispatch from Tetrograd
says:
"The net strategical result of the
fortnight's fighting is that the Rus
sians hold practically a straight line
between Lutsk, Duczacz and Czerno
witz. The military critics point out
that tho capture of Radziviloff and
tho driving of the enemy forces of
Urody and in all likelihood further in
tho direction of Lembcrg will almost
inevitably compel the withdrawal of
the Austrian center from the Tarnopol
region. The Russians advancing
across the Volhynian-Galician frontier
are .according to the latest dispatches,
less than BO miles from Lembcrg. The
fact that Russian cavalry has been
able to occupy Radziviloff shows Aus
trian recognition of the futility of en
deavoring seriously to oppose the Rus
sian passage of tho frontier. The re
capture of the PotchaiefT monastery
causes much rejoicing among orthodox
Russians.
MARSHALL AS A VOTE GETTER
He Ran 15,000 Ahead of His Ticket
Once in Indiana.
Thomas Riley Marshall was Gover
nor of Indiana for two terms, and held
that ollice when ho was elected Vice
President of the United States. He
was (!2 years old on March 14. He was
born In North Manchester, ind., in 1X51
and practiced law before going into
politico.
llis effective campaign in Indiana,
resulting iu Ills election as Governor
in 1908, brought him to public notice
as a national figure. He carried Indi
ana in 1908 by a majority of ln.mio at
the same time that the iloosicr State
went for William Howard Taft by a
majority of 10,000.
. Vice President Marshall holds a rec
ord almost equal to that of President
Wilson as a university man, being a
graduate of Wabash College, Notre
Dame University, and the University
of Pennsylvania. On Oct. 2, 1895, he
married Miss Lois I. Kintsey of Angola
Ind., twenty years after he was ad
mitted to prni ttco as a lawyer.
From ls7ti to 1892 Mr. Marshall was
a member of the firm of Marshall &.
McNagny of Columbia City. Ind. In
1K'.I2 the firm name was changed to
Marshall, McNagny & Clugston and
remained as such until its senior mem
ber was elected Governor in 19tiS.
Vice President Marshall is a slender
wiry man and a Presbyterian, like the
President.
During his administration as Gover
nor of Indiana Mr. Marshall was re
sponsible for many important legis
lative measures. One of these was
the ratltlcutlon of the income tax
amendment to the Federal Constitu
tion. He also favored the popular
election of Senators. A bill authoriz
ing tho Railroad Commission of In
diana to fix rates, child labor laws,
and laws intended to safeguard work
ers in factories, mines, and on rail
roads also received his indorsement.
Indiana regarded Governor Marshall
as Presidential timber, and thirty In
diana delegates went to the convention
at llaltimore four years ago with in
structions to vote for him us "their
first and only choice." Vice Presi
dent Murshall Is an outdoor man and

A YEAR MORE OF WAR
English History Prof ressor Says Con
flict Will Last Another Winter.
London, June 15. Significance is at
tached to a sentence embodied in a
semi-official French communication re
ceived in London today, inasmuch as it
seems to drftw the attention of the
public to M.liat is considered the serl
ious failure of Germany's recent strat
egy. "It seems, since the Vaux affair,"
the sentence read, "that the Germans
fronting Verdun are maintaining an at
titude of expectation in view of the
menace of events which they feel are
becoming increasingly imminent."
This statement is generally inter
preted in the light of public expecta
tion, that the time is rapidly ap
proaching for an important Entente
allied offensive.
Professor Albert F. Pollard of the
Chair of English History in the Univer
sity of London, lecturing here today on
the progress of the war, said he ex
pected a great offensive by the Allies
on the western front before long, but
that the neople must not expect tlie
war to end before next year 'Die u'
most to be hoped for this year, tie said
was the defeat of Austria, a virtual
settlement of the Halkan ditliculty and
the driving back of the Germans a con
siderablo distance on t lie- western
front. The final defeat of Germany
could only come some time next year,
the speaker added, after a winter of
discontent such a-; Germany had never
known and after another naval battle.
I'rolessor Pollard's anticipations re
lied the prevalent ideas in Loudon.
The view is held here that German
n.ade a serious mistake in strategy
when she pei milted Austria to with
draw half of her effectives from the
Russian front for the operations
against Italy, after having brought her
own reserves from the Russian front
to Verdun, which apparently has had
t lie result of enabling Russia to make
a surprising successful drive in Galicla
and Volliynia. It is further considered
that the recent naval battle deprive!
Gu many temporarily of the means for
prosecuting a combined military and
naval offensive in the Riga region and
thus countering the Russian drive,
which, it is now expected, is likely to
go on to fresh successes, as it is be
lieved it will be extremely dillicult to
reinforce the Teutonic allies on the
Russian front.
Reading today's French semi-oflicia!
communication in connection with the
recent presence of General Jorfre and
the French Ministers in London and
Premier Asquith's announcement on
Wednesday of the proffered British
help for the French, the public are
looking forward to coming events with
curiosity and confidence.
According to reports received in Lnn
don the German and Austrian Govern
ments are making desperate efforts to
conceal the truth about the Russian
drive from their people. The belief
prevails here that weeks must elapse
before the Austrians are able to with
draw forces from the Italian front for
the defense of Lembcrg, and that it
may then be too late.
According to special dispatches from
Petrograd the Russians are withhold
ing their strength on the center and
are driving hard westwiud on both
Hanks. It is believed in Petrograd, ac
lording to the.se dispatches that the
further development of General Brusl
loll s victory will depend largely on
the progress of Russia's western al
lies' general strategic plans. The En
tente Allies are now all in touch by
wireless ami their co-ordination in
itrategy has reaehed a point never be
lore achieved in the course of the war
While the Germans appear to be
making further progress on the Ver
dun trout, an interesting review comes
trom liritish headquarters iu France
tonight. It is to the effect that the
recent fighting in which the Canadians
distinguished themselves is no longer
considered as the opening of the third
battle of Vines. It adds that it is now
very clear that Micro is no great Get'
man concentration on the front of
i pres and that i rcsiiinably nothing in
the nature of a considerable liifantrv
offensive was contemplated. In fact
the Review says, there was no idea of
"Verdun tactics" in this region.

SOUTH SHAFTSBURY
On the evening of June 8 about thir
ty people from Bennington gave the
play, In Old Vermont, written by Mrs.
Dorothy Canfleld Fisher of Arlington,
at Cole hall in South Shaftshury. The
hall was packed by a large and appreci
ative audience and from the time the
curtain rose at the opening until It fell
at the close, the actors bold the closest
attention of the entire audience. The
people of Shaftshury and most especi
ally the pupils and teachers of the
graded school, appreciate the generosi
ty of those who took pert in the play
to come to South Shaftshury to give
the play for the benefit of the graded
school. The school now has a bank
account of $29 as a direct result of
the evening's play. After the play
those having automobiles at South
Shaftshury carried those in the play
back to Bennington as their gift to the
graded school. This was a generous
spirit and well appreciated by teachers
as well as by those in the play. Come
again you good Bennington people!
HOPE FOR CHEAPER GASOLINE
Held Out by Standard Oil Officials,
But They Do Not Say How Soon.
Oflicials of the Standard Oil com
pany said yesterday that the worst
bail passed in the sky-rocketing of
gasoline prices and that a reduction
was to be expected they hoped. The
hope, according to an ollicial who has
to do especially with gasoline, was
based on two factors, first, that the
Standard oil laboratories had found
out how to extract more gasoline
from crude oil, und, second, that the
gasoline producing quality of much of
the oil from the southwestern field
was improving. Tho officials, however,
were not sure about the exact date on
which the price was to be cut.
It was explained that the present
high price of gasoline was due to a
combination of causes, which. It was
shown, it was not easy for the layman
to comprehend. In the first place,
there is the war. Most of the sources
of production in Europe are not pro
ducing at this time. The Dardanelles
being closed, the allies cannot get
gasoline f groin the Russian lileds, and
Russia isn't selling it to any one else.
The Russians and Austrians have been
battling over the Austrian oil fields,
and production is at a standstill there.
That makes a large demand upon the
American supply.
Again, the Herman. Austrian and
Turkish markets for the by products
of crude edl. other than gasoline, are
cut off. That makes an over-production
of by-products, the loss of profit
on which must be born iu large part
by users of gasoline.
Another factor In the great ad
vance which has set the present rec
ord price, was that, two months or
so ago, when the heavy production
season was beginning the production
ol the Ciishliig fields In Oklahoma
fell off almost 50 per cent and what
oil continued to flow did not produce
the same amount of gasoline as be
loro Standard laboratories have been
working harder than ever of late, the
ollldals saiil. to get more gasoline
from crude oil, and they have suc
ceeded. It was asserted, in materially
Increasing the percentage. This. it
was said, should soon be reflected In
the market, but there were no pre
diction of large reduction, however,
while market conditions continued.

euld not at once respond. Mean
while the thief had secured a ?aarp
axe and was industriously cutting tho
screening from the door. He i.uended
to remove the screen and insert his
band to unhook the door. Miss Twit
chell, however, had emphatic . ideas
about a high-priced screen door being
so ruthlessly ruined and the men
opened the door to grab the intruder.
Tho man got to his feet and before
he could be seized had jumped off tho
piazza and made motions with, his feet
across the yard in sucli manner that
in a few seconds no burglar was vis
ible. Unluckily, however, he left his
hat and two bottles of chemicals. Just
what purpose he had for the chemicals
is a mystery as there are no safes or
strong boxes on the premises.
Chief Brazil and Officer Hurley ar
rived in a short time and took charge
of tlie burglar's hat and liquid kit. At
first it was believed to be a plain
drunk w ho did not know where he was
nor what he was doing. The manner
in which he left the piazza when tho
door was suddenly opened ami streak
ed across the yard discounted this
theory. With a description of the man
furnished by those who plainly saw
him cutting himself across tiie yard,
the oflicers believe they can eventually
round him up. Miss Twitchell is mys
tified as to why anyone should wish to
break into her house as no money is
kept on the premises.
WHEELER AT WINDSOR
Bogus Check Man Taken to State'a
Prison to Serve Out Sentence.
Burlington. June 16. Charles Ed
ward Wheeler, with many aliases, was
taken yesterday by the sheriff's depart
incut to Windsor, where he will com
plete the sentence imposed in Denning
ton county court of not less than threo
nor more than five years. Wheeler
one of the two most cunning workers
in bogus checks, was arrested in this
city Tuesday on complaint of a detec
tive from the William J. Burns Detec
tive Agency, taken before Judges
Hall and Tracy fur hearing and order
ed committed to tlie house of correc
tion for not less than two nor more
than three years, the original sentenco
imposed in Chittenden county court
last fall when he was found guilty ol
passing a worthless check. Tlie pa
role given him by the (iovernor which
gave him lis liberty from the Stato
prison, where he was serving the sen
tence imposed by Bennington county
court, is also violated, it having beon
shown at the hearing that he had
passed about twenty bogus checks
in the West during the month of May.
Wheeler very much disliked tho idea
of having to return to the State pris
on at Windsor, pteferrlng to first servo
the sentence at Rutland, but It was
deemed best that he complete tho sen
tenco at Windsor, after which he will
M-nc his term at Rutland.
