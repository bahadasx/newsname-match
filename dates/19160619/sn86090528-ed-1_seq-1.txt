Washington, June 19 America's
mailed fist confronts the Carranza
government. Orders for the mobiliza

border service, backed by the dis
patch of more warships to Mexican
waters, with transports, constitutes a
threat. If this last trump card does
not sorvj the purpose intended, offi
cii! m ftar war will follow.
The calling out of the militia does
not mean intervention, it is stated.
The policy is to keep Pershing's expe
dition where it is now located and to
stronethen the border patrol with a

RAISED TO
RANK OF
ADMIRAL
Mayo is Made Commander of Atlantic
Fleet, Taking Charge Today; Suc
ceeds Fletcher Who is Assigned
to Shore Duty
By United Press.
Washington, June 19. When Vice
Admiral II. T. Mayo succeeds Admi
ral Frank F. Fletcher In command of
the Atlantic, fleet today, he will be ad
vanced to the rank of admiral.
Rear Admiral DeWitt Coffman, com
manding the sixth division of the fleet,
will be advanced to the grade of vice
admiral, succeeding Admiral Mayo.
Admiral Fletcher will automatically
became a. rear admiral. He will re
ceive an Important shore detail.
Secretary of the Navy Daniels an
nounced these changes after a confer
ence with President Wilson. The sec
retary also conferred personally tills
week with Admirals Fletcher ana
Mayo.
"When relieved of the command to
day," said Secretary Daniels. "Admiral
Fletcher will have served a little long
er than fleet commanders usually
serve. He is a splendid officer and
has accomplished much with the fleet.
He has completed his tour of duty as
commanding officer of the fleet, and
there is no other reason for . the
change.
"Admiral Mayo is an officer of great
ability, and has rendered splendid ser
vice,' said Mr. Daniels. "He. has the
confidence of the officers and men in
the entire fleet."
Admiral Mr:; is the man who pre
cipitated the' trouble with Huerta
which resulted in the occupation of
Vera Cruz by American forces. The
admiral insisted that Huerta .salute
the American flag because of the ar
rest of American marines at Tampieo
when they went ashore to get mail.
Later marines were landed at Vera
Cruz, and Admiral Fletcher was in
command of that movement.
In service circles unanimous praise
was given today to Mr. Daniels' selec
tion of Vice Admiral Mayo for the
most coveted of posts. There is a
particular feeling of satisfaction at
the appointment because of thu fear
that Vice Admiral Mayo's part In the
Tampieo affair during the critical days
of the struggle with Huerta had plac
ed the officer's star under a cloud.
But Admiral Fletcher proved a
strong friend for Vice Admiral Mayo,
and when the Atlantic fleet was or
ganized, with Admiral Fletcher in
command. Rear Admiral Mayo receiv
ed a command of the battleship
Squadron and of the first division, with
the rank of vice admiral.
Vice Admiral Mayo comes to fleet
command at the age of fifty-six, re
tiring in December, 1918. His recent
duties have been as commandant of
the Mare Ist-md navy yard, aid for
personnel, and division commander in
'.lie Atlantic fleet.

The Republicans of Grady county.
met at the city hall Saturday after.
noon and put out a ticket for prima

one. , . a.V'fft.'.-V.i' f,i :.
The meeting wasfealled to order in
due and ancient form. J. W. Kayser
was called to tho chairman' seat and
stated tho object of the meeting. He
told hlB compatriots, in-a few 'well
rounded sentences that it was tho
duty of the Grady county wins Of tho
G. O. P. to get 01ft and do things; to
nominate a ticket; and win a victory. '.
Greeted by a dpple of applause, Col.
William Dwyert arose and stated to
those assombhitl that he w'uhed to talk
a few minntee upon thd assurance of
national Republican success. He told
his auditors all about the big 0. 0. P.
dow-wow In Chicago; he told them
how many who had hoped to see
Roosevelt namexl as the leader Of the
grand party which was destined to
deal a blow of crushing defeat upon
the man from New Jersey; he told
how, at tho last moment the big dojfa
with the brasa collars thought Roww
velt'a welcoming back to the standpafr
fold at the present season would bo
Inopportuno, unfortunate and ill ad
vised; he told how the galleries
wnooped and whistled for RooBevelt
while the, delegates! sweated and smok
ed and chewed long green and noted
for Hughes.
And then the speaker assured his
auditors that all the Republican party;
of Grady county needed was to get to
gether and whoop things up and let
the people of this glorious state know,
that it had cut its initk teeth, and Its
eye teeth and, In the due course of hu
man events, victory . would sail down
and perch, with folded" wings, upon,
the proper standard.
After seventeen pairs of inds bad
clapped forth a thunder of applause,
the gathering relegated all oratory in
to the background and got down tn
brass tacks.
Notwithstanding many assurance
had been passed out that the doors f
the church were being kept open and
that the, light was being yept working
overtime for the return of those wbo

leaderless Progressives, the local rank
