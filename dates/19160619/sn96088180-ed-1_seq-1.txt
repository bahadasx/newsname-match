flanking attacks on tho retreating
Austrlans, the Russluns have renewed

cording to dospatchea from Petro

' It tbe drive In this region is sue
cessful, the Russian line from the
Lutsk region to the Roumanian bor-1
der will be atralghtened out. A
heavier resistance than that of Ciorn-1

can he readily reinforced by means
of the railroad from Lemberg.
Furious fighting continues In the

ICERS
TEETH TO CAHA
Addnistratica Hakes Exhibit cl Force by Ordering Mob
ilization of State Militia fcr Service at the Border,
and by Sending Warships and Transports to Mexican
Ports Ready to fight If Occasion Decands .
Washington, June 10.- America's
mailed flat confront! the Carransa
government today. Orders for prac
tically all state militia for border
service, backed by dispatch of more
fighting ships and transports, consti
tutes the threat. It Is the admlnla-
tratlon's last trump card to quiet a
troubleaome altuatlon, . If his last
trump does not take the trick, offi
cials fear war .will follow. , ,
Some administration officials today
frankly admitted a fear that dispatch
of 100,000 more men to the border
may cause some of the more reck
less of Carransa commanders to com
mit an act that could have only one
reeult. . ,. , .
Official! seemed certain the mailed
fist will have the desired effect They
believed, though. . that the Unltod
Statea will be thoroughly prepared
by the latest atep for anything that
develops below the boundary. . .
Calling the militia does not sow
mean intervention. The policy la
still to keep General Pershing's col
umn where It la and to strengthen
the border patrol so much aa to end
the recM outbursts of banditry. 1
The most disturbing thing In a
mass of perplexing rumors and facta
waa the report that Carransa had
aent an ultimatum, demanding Amer
ican troop withdrawal within a week.
The president made bis militia call
last night -
Tbe big underlying thing Is the
economic situation la Mexico. It is
very bad, according to official re
ports. Thla reacts for trouble by
creating a chaotic condition and by
stimulating banditry among men
whose only sustenance seems to lie
In loot. .
The militia call, officials hoped,
may cause Carransa to make extreme
efforts to hold hla men In check. But
these aame officials admitted a tear
that the call may fan the Mexican
populace Into auch indignant antt-
Americanism that a break can not be
averted. Certainly In some Mexican
quarters the news will be taken as
meaning a preparation for war'.
The orders Issued last night con
template having about 100,000 more
men ready for border work. Where
and when they will be sent depends
on General Funston'a orders. They
are ordered to mobilise and camp In
their respective states.
The troops will not be sent at once
to the border. The war department
contemplates reliefs, so that tbe en
tire force will not hnve to be In oon-
etont attendance. . .
The response to the militia call
will be closely watched, but from re
ports already In, the national guards
of numerous states are really anxious
to go.
The fact that the United States
troopers In the fight Saturday below
Ranchlta were not actually engaged
with de facto government forces, and
came out unscathed, caused rejoicing
here today. The big tear here Satur
day night waa that thla fight might
epell the beginning ot the end, pro
voking Intervention through a clash
with Carranca's men. All outward
signs except Carransa's reported
withdrawal 1 ultimatum point to an
effort by Carransa and his authori
ties to keep their men In check. Be
hind It, however, Is a growing dis
position among Carransa officials to
be more strenuous In demands upon
the United Statea perhaps for home
consumption, but certainly In a way
that displeases this government. J
The demands of General Trevlno
that Penning'! forces do not move
except outunder pain ot a MexMmust take the double oath of alle
can attack, Is still regarded here ii glance! .' V
a;part at Mexican bombast, which will
t unheeded.
y Army men openly express the fear
that neither Carransa nor his com
manders will be able to prevent an
attack on Pershing's column and the
consequent precipitation ot Interren
ton.' Should this occur, they said,
war. without doubt, will follow.
Admitting the gravity of the alto
etlon. Secretary Lansing said today:
"There Is more excitement and Ir
ritation In Mexico than heretofore."
The statement waa the more signi
ficant In view ot 'Lansing's persistent
refusal for weeks past to make any
comment except to mention "co
operation'' with the de facto govern
ment ' '" ' '' :" '
A note of 10,000 words or more
a strong and forceful refusal to heed
Carransa'g withdrawal request will
be en router to Carransa before night
Thla note nay precipitate the trouble
that, every official fears an actual
clash between ' Mexican forces and
Americans. ,

MILITIA CAN HOW
CROSS THE BORDER
Washington. June 19. National
guardsmen may be sent across the
Mexican border without further con
gressional action, In the opinion ot
Chairman Chamberlain of the senate
military affairs committee. So, con
fident la he ot this that he does not
intend to ask congress for any fur
ther approval or authorisation for
such a step, he said today.
Chamberlain bases his belief on
the ground that tn case Invasion
ot the United States la threatened,
very broad powers are allowed tbe
president to meet the emergency, He
said he did not doubt that among
these powers Is the president's right
to order atate troops Into Mexican
territory aa a strateglo atep to pre
vent Mexican aggression.
The weight of opinion Is that the
state . troops may not be used for
a campaign In Mexico before July 1.
