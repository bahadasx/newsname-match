A long blast of the Santa Fe shops
whistle between 12 and 1 o'clock to
day separated from civilian life half
a hundred Topeka men, apprentices.
clerks and men from all walks of life.
It meant that civilian life had ended
that from now on they are subject
to the commands of Uncle Sam.
Prom Santa Fe shops, from clothing
stores, from the postoffices. from the
General Frederick Funstan, oomman
telephone company's offices, from the
Santa Fe offices, from the soda foun
tains of drug stores, members of Bat
tery A dropped their work and has
tened to the armory- There they re
ported, jumped into uniforms and
placed themselves at the disposal of
officers in charge.
They won't sleep at home tonight
they'll make bunks for themselves at
the armory. At 3 or 4 o'clock this af
ternoon it was announced that a guard
would be placed around the armory
and from then on arrivals and depar
tures will have to be checked up to the
officer of the day.
Recruits C'ominsc In.
At the same time that members of
Battery A arrived to report for duty
recruits were offering their services.
By 1:30 o'clock this afternoon fully 16
men from all stations in life had re
ported for duty and had been listed.
Tonight, Dr. Seth A. Hammell with
Captain J. M. Hite and Adjutant Gen
eral C. I. Martin will arrive in the city.
Dr. Hammell is captain of the medical
corps of the Kansas National Guard.
He will conduct physical examina
tions during the night and weed out
the unfit.
D. S. Logan, owner of the Armory
building, appeared at headquarters
with a long face to inquire whether his
son, Kent B. Logan, had been muster
ed out. The young man is still a mem
ber of the company.
"Well, I guess he should go and I'll
stand right behind him," said Mr.
Logan. "He wasn't married when he
joined the battery but now he is and
is living on a farm near Lyndon."
"It's pretty tough on a whole lot of
us.' replied Scrgt. Frank D. Wilson.
"I've got a wife and two children and
am paying for a home."'
But just the same Sergeant Wilson
called long distance and put in a call
for Kent Logan at Lyndon.
Called From ijas Vegas.
Then there's Robert E. Goshorn, a
member of Battery A, working in the
Santa Fe hospital way out at Las
Vegas. A telegram has been dis
patched to him to report for duty
immediately.
Two brothers, T. Parry and F. Parry,
one the victim of an automobile ac
cident, appeared and reported for
duty. They live out at 1318 West
Eighth street, and the one with an
injured arm is expected to be pressed
into recruit service.
"My father wasn't at home this
noon," said one of the Parry boys. "My
mother was and, of course, she didn't
like it but she took it bravely because
she knew we had to go."
The Missouri and Kansas Telephone
company is furnishing more men than
any other concern in Topeka. On it:
pay roll are Lieut. J. C. Hughes. Sergt.
Earl Cummins, Sergt. Nels Anderson.
Privates Paul Sweeney and Ronec

Cummins is in St. Joseph and called
by long distance this morning stating
that he would leave St. Joseph for To
peka on the first train.
Men in Overalls.
At 1 o'clock seven men, some in
overalls, others with white collars and
neckties, stepped into the armory.
"Recruits." called a member of the
battery.
Instantly the men were taken into a
side room and their addresses and
other requisites for enlistment tabu
lated. Ora S. Morris, 133 Van Buren street,
a blacksmith employed at Tenth and
Jefferson streets, was the first ex
amined. "I tried to get into Fred Funston's
Twentieth Kansas," said Morris, "but
was too young and the old man raised
Cain. But you can't beat me out of
going this time."
Ernest Sheldon, a slender lad of 18
years, and an apprentice for the Kel
ley Printing company, was the next
one called upon to answer questions.
Sheldon lives at 624 Taylor.
"My mother didn't like the idea of
my enlisting at all," said Sheldon,
"but I was determined to do it and
finally she gave in."

tended to enlist before he told his
wife. Others refused to give their
names.
James Whiteker, motorcycle police
man, was in the police station at 12
o'clock.
"Going to war?" someone asked.
"Suppose I will if the guard is called
out, but we've got to be called out first.
I don't take a great deal of stock in
it."
Ten minutes later the big whistle
sent forth its long biast and White

announcing that mobilization was in

The messages were substantially
Identical and followed this general

"Telegram received and mobilization

None contained any estimate of the
time required to get the troops under
arms. Secretary Baker reiterated the
statement that none of the guardsmen
affected by the new order would be
sent to the border until General Fun
ston decided where and when he want

state mobilization points until muster

A young man who had been sub

more than any member of Battery A,
was the first to report for duty.
Richard B. Porter, son of Judge Si

court, was at dinner at his home when
the whistle sounded. Five minutes
later, according to the judge, his son
had made his goodbyes, put on his
uniform and was speeding on his way
to the armory.

Mexico City, June 19. Gen

meeting in front of his residence,
urged the citizens to refrain
from hostile acts against Ameri
cans and declared he had hopes
of arranging peacefully the dif

United States.
Sends Note Anyhow.
Washington, June 19. While the

the mobilization of the national
guard for border duty. President Wil
son directed that his reply rejecting
General Carranza's demand for the
recall of American troops from Mex
ico go forward immediately.
In refusing to withdraw the troops,
the United States reaffirms the friend

ward the de facto government in
Mexico and sharply rebukes General
Carranza for unwarranted charges
and insinuations of bad faith contain

th& communication will be given out
for publication. It was said at the
department, however, that it might be
made public later today. The docu
ment is believed to contain between
7,000 and 10,000 words.
Soon . afterward it became known
that the reply to Carranza's last note
demanding the recaU of General
Pershing's expedition would go for
ward today. The reply is understood
to inform Carranza that the Ameri
can troops would not be recalled until
the de facto government has demon
strated its ability to guard the border
from bandits and to reiterate the po
sition of the United States govern
ment toward Mexico.
The Mezto report told this story:
"A boat from the warship approach
ed Mazatlan wharf and was warned to
keep off until permission to land could
be obtained from the military authori
ties. It went back to the ship and sev
eral hours later returned with its
crew armed. The officer in command
was told permission for landing had
not been given and an argument en
sued. "A crowd of soldiers and civilians
had gathered on the wharf and in the
midst of the discussion a drunken
Japanese fired a shot at the Americans
who promptly replied with a volley
into the crowd. Carranza soldiers re
turned the fire and the boat withdrew,

last trump to quiet a troublesome sit

frankly admitted a fear that dispatch
of 100,000 more men to the border
may cause some of the reckless Car

keep General Tershing's column where

trol so much as to end the recent out
bursts of banditry.
The disturbing feature in a mas? of
perplexing rumors was the report that
Carranza has sent an ultimatum de
manding American troops' withdrawal
within a week. This did not com
here officially today but there were
officials who said such a move would
not surprise them.
Behind the militia call last night
lies a realization, officially admitted,
that the Carranza government rrow
gradually weaker, with consequent in
creased possibilities of trouble between
that regime and the United States.
The big underlying thing is the eco

The militia call, oficials hope, may
cause Carranza to make extreme ef
forts to hold his men in check. But
on the other hand, officials admitted
a fear that it may fan the Mexican

Americanism that a break cannot be
