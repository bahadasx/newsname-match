WHY A 140,000 MAN COT FIRED.
In the July, Woman's Home Com
panion Is the following story of how
and why a $40,000 man got fired:
"A big commercial house in the
Middle West raised the salary of one
ot Its officers to 140,000 a year.
"The officer waa greatly pleased.
'Now my ambition ia satisfied, he
said.
"Within two years the concern had
found a way to dispense with this of
ficer's services. It was done cleverly
and smoothly; the man never sua
pected the real reason why he was re
leased. "The head of the concern had over
heard his remark. 'We want no men
In this business whose ambition is sat
isfied,' he said. 'When a man is sat
isfied, when he ceases to plan and'
fight tor the future, we begin to lose
money on him." '

more alcohol; It too thin, add a little
more shellac.

There are some young men so con

the certainty ot comfortable medioc

say to them that some ot the most
pitiful letters that have ever come to
my desk have been from Washington
clerks who have begun to grow gray
around the temples. 'How can I make
the break and get out Into business?
they ask. And there Is no answer."
