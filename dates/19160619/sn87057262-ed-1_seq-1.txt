C. B. Stone, general superintendent

In official and aristocratic circles,
there is evidence of a moderately

"We do not distrust President Wil

with fresh guarantees, in stronger

How far, however, the president
may proceed In such a move, puzzles
Chamberlain as well as most army

the state troops may not be used for

take the doable oath of allegiance.

WASHINGTON. June 19.—Seers
tary War Baker took steps today
to make the national guard available
for immediate duty in Mexico.
The secretary, through General
Crowder, sent a copy of a special
resolution to Chairman Hay of the
house military affairs committee,
which If acted on favorably by con
gress, would make effective at once
that section of the new army law
which gives the war department
authority to order the militia into
foreign territory.
Neither the secretary nor Geneml
Crowder would discuss the step.
Other officers, members ol the gen

"precautionary plan." Thoy said the

the wildest possibilities and that
every effort would be made to be com
