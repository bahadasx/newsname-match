GREATEST MILITARY ACTIVITY IN
COUNTRY SINCE WAR WITH SPAIN
BORDER TENSE WITH
While the whole country is astir with the mobilizatiod
of the national guard for border duty. President Wilson di
rected that the reply rejecting Carranza's demand for the
recall of American troops from Mexico go forward irrn
mediately. The note rebukes Carranza for the unwarrant*
ed charges of bad faith contained in his communication.
Meantime a force of at least 100.000 guardsmen are
being mustered into federal service. The governors of all
states had replied late today. The men are arming and
proceeding to state mobilization points.
From both coasts additional naval vessels are undei*
orders to proceed to Mexican waters for the relief of Amer*
iqans wbo may gather from the interior. Considerable
anxiety^ is felt for tHe safety of Americans of whom 5)000
w.
still are in Mexico including 1,000 in the capitaL
j._ be held under arms for a month, whil£*tfie
process service is worked'liut.^
Washington. June 19.—Comniunicatiohs4 -front the
Mexican embassy, announcing that there had been a clash
between a boat crew from the Gunboat Annapolis and Car
ranza soldiers at Mazatlan yesterday and asking that in
the present tense situation no men be landed in Mexico
from warships under any circumstances, was delivered to
the state department by the embassy secretary.
Soon afterward it was announced that the reply to
Carranza's last note, asking withdrawal of troops, will go
forward late today, declaring that the.troops will not be
withdrawn until the defacto government demonstrates.its
ability to subdue the bandits and guard the border.
The Mexican embassy secretary sought nn engage-*
ment with Secretary Lansing for the Ambassador Desig
nate Arrenendo, but was informed that Lansing was very
busy and making no appointments.
Regarding the general situation, Secretary Lansing*
said dispatches to the state department showed increasing
excitement in many sections below the border.
Chairman Chamberlin and Congressman Hay of thek
senate and house military committees were summoned toJ
the White House for a conference early in the day.
"I have felt all along that we would be forced to inters
vene/' said Senator Chamberlain when called. The Mexfc*
can people, so largely ignorant, have a notion they cart
whip us and it will be necessary for us to go in and cleanj
up the situation."
The Hay resolution would put into immediate effect
Section 111 of the new bill which will not become effective
under its own terms until July 1. It authorizes the presi-»
dent to draft all members of the National Guard reserves
at his discretion when congress shall have authorized the
use of the armed forces of the country.
MAY CROSS THE BORDER.
As only congress has power to declare war the presi*
dent could use the guardsmen even under this section only
for repelling invasion in the absence of specific authority
from congress. /It is held however, that the militia may
be sent across the international line if necessary in the op*
eration of defending America^ territory. Steps were tak
en today to call into service doctors of the medical reserve
corps for duty in connection with the mobilization of th^
national guard. Every man mustered into the federal
service must be physically examined in order to prevent
undue extension of the pension rolls.
