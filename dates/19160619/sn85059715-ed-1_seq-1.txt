Story of a Atari and a Wurrmn.
That which happened wa* on a
pring night more than thirty-five
year* ago. A man and a woman who
had ticket* to Kill* alighted late In
the afternoon. The atory ha* heen
kept alive by word of mouth, no naturally

that ahe wa* young?In her early
twontle*. purbap*?and well dreanod.
Of the man not a ncrap of deacrlptlon
remain*. Apparently there wa* not
anything about him to attract oven
the carnal attention of the tralnmon
or paasenger*.
Several person* on the train noted
them a* they atarted eastward down
the track*. It was acceptod that they
were walking out In the country to
visit relatives or friends on some of
:he nearby farms. The train steamed
iway and out of sight.
The next morning a gang of track
aboror* found the girl dead beside
.ho -track*. There was a rovolver
around In her head. No sign of a
druggie was apparent. She was ly-1
tin as poucefully as though she was
isjeep. Tbo ground about was dry.
ind neither aba nor h?r ccmpinlon
lad left any footprints. Tbo ablence
of footprints gave no clew as
o the direction taken by her slayer.
Her Identity a Mystery.
It was not suicide, for there was
to weapon beside the body. The body
ras not Identltled. There were no
narks on the clothes. There was no
>ockelbook, no rings, lockets or anyh'ng
that would Indicate who sl.?
gas or from where she had come. All
hut remained was the body of n
roc ns woman who had been young
ind beautiful.
An Inquest was held on the spot.
>ut nothing was developed. A search
or the man was made, bnt be had
llsappeared. So they burled the dead
Ctrl where she had been murdered;
without a coffln, as the story goes,

lUletly. bnt there were no relatives
if the girl to inspire a search. The
nan was gone, no one knew anything
ibout the case and it ended right
