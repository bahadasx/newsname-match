The Columbia Browns got their
heavy artillery in action for just one
big inning jesterday afternoon, and
the Moberly Athletics, Central Mis
souri League leaders, were defeated.
The score was C to 5.
iMcCamley, a right-handed hurler,
former member of the pitching staff
of the St. Louis Browns, was the Mo
berly sacrifice to Columbia's slug
ging. The second session was the
fateful one.
Moberly had gathered two runs
when Columbia assumed the offen
sive. Taj lor, the first man up,
walked. Mason hit to left, putting
George at second. McClIsh duplicated
Mason's act, and the manager came
home. Blake, shortstopping for Mo
berly, scooped up Ding Davis' ground
er and chucked It high over first, and
Mason trotted in, Davis going to sec
ond.
Brjant Brings In Two.
Ed Hill lifted one to Nichols for
the first out of the inning. Bryant
then dropped a Texas leagurer be
hind second, talljing McClish and
Davis. Foster hit a double over the
right field fence, scoring Bryant, but
was out trjing to reach third. Dip
pold followed with a two-base hit.
but Vogt lined to Van Studdiford,
stopping the carnage.
Columbia had the best of the argu
ment from then on until the fifth,
when Moberly counted three more,
and the game was in a knot. Three
hits, one a three-bagger, and an er
ror were the Ingredients.
It was anj body's game then. Both
sides took the count In the one-two-three
order until the eighth. In the
home half of the seventh, Nichols,
who plajs right field for Moberly,
made a catch that should have a place
in the archives of Central Missouri
League historj-. Foster had sent one
high and wide into right field. Nich
ols, misjudging the ball, hurdled the
fence, turned, reached back over the
fence and caught the ball with his
gloved hand about six inches from
the turf.
Browns Win in Eighth
Dippold was safe when Hasler
missed his hot grounder In the home
half of the eighth. Vogt laid down
a perfect sacrifice bunt, advancing
the slugging German to second. Man
ager Taj lor then lifted the game
from the fire by doubling down the
left foul line. Mason hit one to left
that bounced off of C. Williams' glove.
At this juncture, McCamlej who had
suffered much during the afternoon,
was taken from the mound and Du
venic was sent to the firing line. He
held them safe, causing both Mc
Clish and Davis to ground straight
into his mitt: The box score follows:

BAKER TAKES STEPS
TO SENDJJTMILITIA
Congress Acting on Bill to
Make Entrance Into
Mexico Legal.
NEW NOTE IS READY
Will Refuse Carranza's De
mand That the U.S.
Troops Withdraw.
By United Tress.
WASHINGTON'. June 19. Secretary
of War Newton I). Haker took steps
this afternoon to make possible the
entrance of the militia into Mexico.
The special resolution which was
introduced into Congress, if acted
upon favorably, will make effecUve
that section of the new law which
gives the Government the authority to
order state militia into foreign terri
tory immediately.
Secretary Lansing admitted this
afternoon that the conditions, the ex
citement and the Irritation are great
er In Mexico today than ever before.
This is considered the most signifi
cant statement in weeks.
Consul Silliman and other Ameri
cans in Mexico are hurrying from the
interior to the border. The note re
fusing Carranza's request for the
withdrawal of the American troops
will be forwarded this evening. It is
thought that this will bring about a
clash between the two nations.
Government officials are pleased
with the favorable reports from the
mobilizing of militia throughout the
country.
The railroads have agreed to fur
nish all the trains necessary for the
transportation of troops and supplies,
regardless of conditions.
