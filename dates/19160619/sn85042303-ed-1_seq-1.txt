If the Plattsburg camp is a training school for professional and business
men, It is also proving a school of practical experience for the regular officers
in charge, since the size of the student commands under tutelage this year
is making them use their war science and campaign wisdom in working out
a scheme that will bring the men to proper battlefield and adequate camping
grounds. This problem wljl come to the fore more particularly in the July
encampment, when there will be four full regiments, about 4,000 men to han
dle, or just four times as many as they have had at any time before. Looking
ahead to that four regiment maneuvre campaign, a tentative plan is being
worked out for sending the regiments ahead one or two at a time on suc
cessive days, none knowing where the other is going or what it is doing and
then bringing them together in a series of mimic combats. No. 1, rifle practice
at Plattburg; No. 2, view of the camp; No. 3, left to right, Major Murray, Unit
ed States army, in command at Plattsburg, and Captain Halstead Dorey, Unit
