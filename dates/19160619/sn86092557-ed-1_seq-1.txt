President Carl Gray Pleased
With Progress That Has
Been Made Here.
At Least Not On Account of
Traffic From New
Mines.
? "We'll have nothing to do with the
coal being shipped from the Helen's
Run region for a fow months yet. As
soon as the road Is ready for rolling
stock a great quantity of coal which
<lias already been dug will be shipped.
This will be handled to it's destination
Kby the Baltimore and Ohio railroad or
~$it> connecting lines," said President
Carl Gray of the Western Maryland
t^rotfd yesterday.
j "The road to Helen's Run should be
^ completed almost any time now, and
the work on the line between Hutch
inson and Wyatt is remarkably well
advanced. The three shovels which
' ard being used there make tlio matter
of ten miles of railway grading a very
insignificant proposition."
gj^jfren you will not handle the coal
1 from the new Consolidation Coal com
pljjany-mines until after you have com
plated your yard at Criefton and at
tht one at Connellsville?" he was ask
ed.
"Until we can make arrangements
fgtfrsftunir equipment and men running
through from Connellsville to Chief
ton, the B. & O/will have to handle the
HJUftit. The contract for the Western
Maryland yard to be built at Connells
SSJlle^WflinJe 161 Monday, JurfeTVltf
J Iprill call-tor a '400-car.capacity yard
irlttt ,the facilities to increase ?ifc to
l.ooo-car capacity as soon as the bus
ttefcs demands It.
President Gray also stated that the
erection of a water tank to provide tho
engines with water would not be need
ed at Chlefton as there is a spring
?>With a drop of water on the Western
Maryland property which will furn
ish 25,000 gallons of water daily. The
spring water is soft and has no de
meliorating effect on engine tanks as
! does the water in West Fork river
which is impreginated with sulphur.
Sulphur, according to the railway
president, is the cause of much trou
ble1 with engines in all mining, sec
tions. Concerning whether there
; would, when Western . Maryland ser
vice is started, be sufficient loading
i to permit the road to run one train
each way a day, Mr. Gray said that
-this could not be ascertained as pres
ent but that should the coal business
keep up at it's present rate of in
; crease there would be need of more
than one train per day.
The Western Maryland will erect
j jengine house at either Hutchinson
] |;or Chlefton, Mr. Gray said. "We have
| not much room and I think it will be
1 necessary to placo the engine house
j at Hutchinson. This however, will
not develop for three or four months,
I during which time as I mentioned be
?<ifo'fe}the Baltimore and Ohio will han
dle the vHelen's Run output."
L -"Will tou company ask the Balti
more and Ohio railroad to double
[ track the road between Fairmont and
Connellsville, or are the present faclll
' ties sufficient to handle, say 200 cars
of coal from your line and the average
jsiWflf- which the Baltimore and Ohio
sends over that line?"
iMI think the present facilities are
ample to take care of all the loading
both our line and the Baltimore and
Ohio provides. The Connellsville di
vision has been Improved within the
. p^st year in the way of side tracks
J and additional telegraph offices and
unlets the Pittsburgh and Connells
ville yards become Jammed with load
ing the side tracks and the Fairmont
yard should be well able to keep 400f
cars of coal moving daily. On our
line which is single track we handle
Joni/an,. average of 600 cars of coal one
way East from Cumberland every day.
Pour hundred cars of coal is not
much,'* (The Western Maryland road
east' from Cumberland is single track
ed).
Mr. Gray was particularly pleased
with the manner in which the con
?fraction work was progressing in tho
Helen's Run and the Wyatt section
and feels that the engine which he will
keep at Chlefton or Hutchinson and
the one which comes daily from Con
nellsville will havo enough work to
Qwm them busy.
He wiirplace an man in charge or
t)ie trains which will come into and
ont'Of Fairmont yard. This man will
lyffiacted at-.Fairmont and will have
the title of either trainmaster or as
sistant trainmaster.

Captain Carskaddon Fears
There Might Be Some
Delay.|
I TelAephone messages are crowding
the lines to the offices of Captains of
Francis Thralls of National Guard com
pany H and Captain Ltfward Cars*
| kaddon of Co. 1. this morning not
ifying the captainB that "I'm here any
time you want me, just call phone
number." Those who have been un
able to phone have called In person
and told both captains that "We'll go
whenever they notify you that we're
needed."
All members of both companies who
have been interviewed expressed en
thusiasm and not one, not even the
married ones, objected to the prospect
ive trip. Many said they would like
to get a good hold on one of "them
greasers shoot him and then plant th?
flag in Chihuahua or Mexico City."
When asked when they would be ready
to go Captain Carskaddon said: "I'm
very much afraid we'd be delayed
| some, perhaps about five minutes!
But give us five minutes and we'll be
marching toward the border." Sheuld
the first regiment be called, Fairmont
will be mine not a few citizons.
Constable Defies
Mob at Watson
A riot which threatened to make]
itself felt in the whole southern end
of Fairmont was started this morning
at Watson when Constable Harry
Comers went there and arrested a
man named Mefua Errica, charged
with violating tEr plBtol totfnr 'act.
Aa soon as . Conners told Errlco to
"come along" he resisted and ran
away , * > ?,~'_tf c?' - JT? ?
Conner chaBed him until Errloo
found a place of hiding In one of the
abandoned coke ovens. Conner weni
In after him and when he began pich.
ing his way out of the oven noticed
that a crowd of 200 men, women and
children had gathered to prevent Br
rlco's arrest. The crowd was armed
with clubs and stones and was mak
ing all sorts of noise yelling at Conner
in language which he was naturally
unable to understand. They threw
themselves In front of Conner and be>
gan shouting something which to
Connor sounded like tbreats.
Conner Immediately pulled bis 44
and pointing it at the crowd made
all back up. He took no chances with
the foreigners and kept his gun up
until ho had Errlco ?afely on a street

he will stay until his trial on charge

Beau Brummels of the Mines
i Interest a Plain Millionaire
"The t almost universa 1 demand
among the men for made-toorder
clothing and the necessity of the wo
men to have many pairs of fancy col
ored leather shoes and perhaps sev
eral pairs of white ones, is one of the
most striking, of the things r have
observed among the miners of W?st
Vrgirjia," said? John D. Rockefeller,
Jr., speaking to a West VJrginlan re
porter* during his visit In Fairmont
yesterday;-'
"I myself still wear ready-made
clothing much of the time, yet the
managers of many of the mining town
stores told me that the men will have
nothing but tailor-made clothing.'
Asked concerning the Immediate
purpose of his visit here Mr. Rocke
feller said:
"This trip has no especial slgnlfi*
cance at all-other-than-my desire to*
learn the' cohdltions of living among
tho miners of West Virginia and Ken
tucky and I am simply accompanying
President-Gray of the Western Mary
land as a guest. The visit has nothing
to do with the price of gasoline or
any other vital Issue. I .am interested
in social welfare work and the manner
of living among the miners has at
tracted most of my attention. West
Virginia at this time of the year is
a delightful place to be, and 1 have
greatly enjoyed my visit."

Facts About His Home
Life.
A Baptist abroad aa well aa at bom*.
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., who bad spent
tbe week-end in this vicinity, attend
ed services at the First Baptist church,
yesterday morning, addressing the
Men's Bible class at tbe Sunday school
hour and speakin* to the children at
the 'clnireh 'bour.vvblch waa the occa
sion of the Annual Children's da; pro
gram. Accompanying Mr. Rockefeller
was Carl R. Gray, president of the
Westorn Maryland railroad, also a
staunch member of the Baptist de
nomination. ,
With the exception of the members
of the Bibe class, tew people of tbe
congregation knew that Mr. Rockefel
ler .wu In ^church until at the close
of the children's program Rev. W. J.
Edd'jr, Invited, him. to the platform'to
speak to tbe children^ The congrega
tion broke in to loud applause as Mr.
Rockefeller made his way to the pat
form, lor every member ot the denom
ination to the smalest child knowa
what the Rockefeller family has done
for the promotion of the' church along
educational, missionary and religious
lines.
Mr. Rockefeller began his romarkB
to, the Children by telling them that
he was very much embarrassed; that
while they had been drilled for a week
or more on the pretty songs and
speeches they had made, he was en
tirely without preparation. Then he
told the children many interesting
things concerning his family and home
ife. He stated that he wbb the father
of aix cbldren, "one girl" he said "then
how many boyB have I." "Five" re
sponded a little tot on tbe front row."
You guessed right the first time, was
Mr. Rockefeller's rejoining and then
he proceeded with his talk In which
he told ot the family altar in their
home where family Bible reading and
prayer were held every day and to
which all the family were expectea
to be in attendance.
Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Gray both
addressed the Men's Bible Class which
is taught by the pastor. Here Mr.
Rockefeier also impressed tbe value of
the family altar on the minds ot his
bearera>and be also suted tliat he be
lieved that every truly successful man
along financial or other lines Is also
a religious man.
Both Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Gray
make It a point to attend their own
church whenever possible.
After the congregation was dis
missed yesterday members of the con
gregation crowded round Mr. Rocke

hands and expressing peasure at hav

en Mr. Rockefeller said further:
"The sentiment among the men
seems to be on the whole harmonious
with a good feeling toward their em
ployers. The local men know more
about this than I. Some of the new
er mining settlements that I visited
are model villages. In this Helen's
Run region I was especially pleased
with the houses, they are far better
than the house ray father lived in dur
ing his youth. In some of the older
mining camps, however, the living ac
commodatione are not so good. 1 am
told that the schools are good and that
educational work among the foreign
era by means of night school is doing
a great deal toward eliminating ignor*
ance and incubating safety first prin
ciples that must.be practiced in min
ing." Mr. Rockefeller talked for near
ly an hour with the West Virginian
representative, and his desire seenv
ed to be to become.better acquainted
with the people of this state and to
have them among his friends.
Although richer and more powerful
in his world than many titled mem
bers of royal families and able to
make or break towns and industries
by the mere signing of hi8 name yet
John D. Rockefeller, Jr., unlike the
popular conception of the sons of mil
lionaires, is a plain ordinary man with
an earnest desire to be considered a3
a regular man on his own merits and
not for his inherited wealth.

Second Regiment Will Rep
resent This State Says
Gen. Bond.
Captain John W. Mason, Jr., of the
Quartermaster Department, will leave
tonight to Join the second regiment
National Guard of West Virginia on
its way to camping grounds at Terra!
Alta. He is the only member of the!
Guard of Fairmont who will be called j
unless orders now out are changed. :
Captain Claude E. Layman, adju
tant of the First regiment with his
staff which is composed of Seregant<
Major John B. Wyatt of Shlnnstou,
Color Sergeant Ray S. Arnett, color!
sergeant filbert L. Kinkead, both ot
Fairmont, batallion sergeant Major Ce
cil H. Riggs of Fairmont stand in
readiness to answer a call for the
First-Regiment but it was learned by
telephone today in a message from
Adjutant General Bond or Charleston
that the Second Regiment would rep
resent West Virginia.
The second regiment Is confined en>
tirely to the southern part of the state
and is very finely equipped. The first
regiment of which the Fairmont com
pany is part while not called for ser>
vice has been instructed to prepare
for any emergency.
Late this afternoon advices from
Washington by telephone to members
of the adjutants staff in Fairmont were
to the effect/that the First Regiment
woittd likely be called to go to Terra
Alta. As was the case in every other
state about one half of the guard was
left tor later call and for police duty.
la's Quota was th* same ?u proportion
as that of the rest of the country.
The local officers of the National
Guard have been in touch with Con
gressman Neely all morning for the
purpose of having htm use bis influ
ence to see. that the First Regiment
js called. Captain Glenn Williams of
Clarksburg and Captains Francis
Thralls and E. B. Carskaddon of Fair
mont have been besieged with ques
tions from membors of the guard who
feel slighted that they have not been
called.
The reason given by the Fairmont
captains is that the second regiment
commander is the ranking colonel. The
second regiment at the last inspection
fell away l>ehlnd the first regiment to
the extent that one of their companies
was ordered mustered out and seven
were given one year each In which to
show an improvement or be mustered
out The first regiment was ordered
to muster out one company and but
one company put on one year's proba
tion. It Is this more than anything
else that has caused the local guards
men to wonder why they have been
left behind and the second called.
