SILK HOSIERY
Hosiery is more this year than a mere adjunct to the toilet. It may sound the color note of the
whole costume. Part of this originates in the shortness of the new skirts, making Hosiery more than
usually prominent; but a good share, too, arises from a desire to have pretty Stockings. You will find
almost every conceivable color, champaigne, bronze, elephant, smoke, pink, tas, putty, gray, navy, king's
blue, pongee, flesh, with white and black of course in generous abundance. Price $1.00, $1.25, $1.50.
