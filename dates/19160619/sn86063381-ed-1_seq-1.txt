Primary HcilUiUM twine lirtW
In Minnesota today. State, congres
sional and county officers are being
elected.
Is Little Interest.
In Bemidji and Beltrami county
there is little interest in the election.
Several county districts report that
the vote is very light. Other dis
tricts report that the most interest
in the election is in the race for com
missioner offices. Up to noon today
several hundred votes had been cast
in Bemidji.
Despite the fact that the day was
clear, voters did not turn out. Even
the candidates and politicians lacked
the "old time" election feeling.
Clapp and Ebernart.
In Bemidji the interest appeared
to center on the United States sena
torial fight. It is believed that the
race in the city will be between
Clapp and Eberhart. Eberhart is
running good on account of action
taken by him when the Bemidji nor
mal school question was up before
the state legislature.
There is little interest in the races
on the Republican state ticket.
A Democratic Fray.
In the Democratic gubernatorial
fray, a three-cornered fight has
aroused much interest.
S. D. Works, C. M. King and P. P.
Dwyer are the candidates. Works
has been identified with the reaction
ary Democrats in the state legisla
ture. Dwyer, a Minneapolis boiler
maker, polled a large labor vote. King
is a good roads advocate.
Dan Lawler, Democratic candidate
for United States senator, was the
only Fred Lynch faction Democrat in
the field. He was opposed by A. J.
Davis of Minneapolis.
Socialist and Prohibition tickets
were not filed.
In the Sixth district congressional
race it is believed that C. B. Buck
man will run far ahead of his oppon
ents in Beltrami county.
There was but little interest in the
legislative and judge of probate elec
tions.
Open Until 9 P. M.
As there has been no opposition
to the charter amendment in Be
midji, the amendment will pass, it
is believed.
Polls will remain open until nine
o'clock tonight.
The Pioneer has made arrange
ments to secure returns from the en
tire state and county and it Is be
lieved that a fairly complete vote
will be received by tomorrow morn
ing.

GAME IS CLOSE 'BIG
BILL" BERRIGAN HERO
Visitors in Lead Twice Large Crowd
and the Band Attends
Game.
In a game featured by heavy hit
ting Bemidji won its fourth straight
victory Sunday afternoon by defeat
ing the Pine River baseball nine at
the new athletic park by a score of
8 to 6.
Twice the visitors were in the lead,
but by heavy and timely hitting the
Bemidji team went ahead.
Three in First.
Bemidji secured a big lead in the
first inning, making three runs on
three hits and an error. In the sec
ond inning Pine River secured two
scores on a base on balls and two er
rors. In the third inning Bemidji
was blanked while the visitors se
cured two more tallies on two hits, a
base on balls and an error.
After the first inning there was
"nothing doing" for Bemidji, being
blanked for five innings by good
pitching and brilliant support. But
when the "lucky seventh" arrived
the fans began clamoring for runs.
In this frame Bemidji made two runs
on a base on balls, a hit and an error
and went into the lead. However,
in the eighth inning Pine River again
went ahead. Iverson, the first man
up, got a hit, but was caught off
first. Ingraham followed with a sin
gle and "Frosty" Thomas, the Pine
River pitcher, proceeded to win his
own Kftjpc by slamming the ball over
the left* field fence, scoring two runs.
Fireworks Started.
In the last of the eighth E. Bailey,
the first man up, struck out. Tanner
then started the fireworks with a
two-bagger to deep right. He scored
on Diedrich's hit. Frank was hit
by a pitched ball and with two men
on bases Berrigan, who had hit safe
three times, scored both men on a
single. Berrigan took second on the
throw-in but was put out at third by
"bone-head" coaching.
In the first half of the ninth the
visitors retired, one, two, three, one
on a strikeout, another by Kanner
berg to Erickson and the third by
Bodreau to Erickson.

O'Neal, "they are not sympathetic.
All they want is results."
Bodreau of Hibbing, a new man,
played second yesterday and showed
up well. He is a fast fielder and a
good "sticker." He should make a
valuable man for the Bemidji in
field.
Erickson, another new man, made
his initial appearance in a Bemidji
uniform yesterday. He played first
base, accepting fourteen chances
without making an error, besides se
curing a two-base hit.
Frank, the hard-nitting cateher
had hard luck with the stick Sun
day, one of his drives being nailed at
the right field fence and another, a
fast grounder, was speared between
first and second. However, he got
on bases twice, being hit once and
securing a base on balls. He scored
both times.
Tanner made a good catch of Goppess'
low drive in the third inning.
There was gloom in the Bemidji
camp when Thomas made his circuit
drive but Bemidji came back strong
in its half and put th game on the
"ice."
Kannerberg was a trifle wild yes
terday but had better control of the
ball as the game progressed.
Bemidji had men on second and
third in the fifth inning with no one
out but could not score.
One of the largest crowds of the
season attended the game Sunday
The Bemidji band was out Sunday
and gave a .concert before the game.
TELEGRAPHONE. A
WONDER OF WORLD,
IS DEMONSTRATED
A telegraphone that supercedes a
talking machine, widens the sphere
of the telegraph, telephone and wire
less records having for its main prin
ciple the localization of magnetism
a principle contrary to science be
cause this magnetism is controlled ab
solutely with permanent records if
desired, or records at will in short,
a machine that records and repro
duces sound energy, is being shown
and demonstraTed at B&sker's Drug
store by W. F. Crutcher of San Fran
cisco, representing the Western agen
cy of the Telegraphone company.
If you want to leave your office,
you plug the telegraphone, and if a
client wants to call you up, he is
informed you are out but still the
message can be taken, the machine
records it and when you return the
indicator shows the record which was
reproduced in the very voice of your
client. Speeches, opera performan
ces and court proceedings can be re
produced.
It is the invention of Valdemar
Paulson, the Danish Edison.
