May Graduate Class
Year Ahead of Time
Washington, June IP. Embarrassed
by a shortage of regular army officers
at this time, members of the general
staff today considered graduation next
month of the class at West Point, who
ordinarily would graduate in dune.
1917. In the event of war, some of
ficials today told Secretary Baker,
such a step would be necessary.
The suggestion now considered is to
give theso men their commisions in
July and send them out as militia and
recruit mstrustors. Should tne num
ber be insufficient, it was suggested
these candidates be commissioned and
assigned posts, while the class that
would ordinar'" graduate in ltus oe
sent out as n r1, instructors.
ATQIM
Suggests Tha - lployers As
sure Boys Their Jobs Will
Be Held for Them
Governor Withycombe today ex
pressed gratification at the mauuer in
which the Oregon citizens are respond
ing to the call to the colors. In a state
ment issued to the press the governur
said:
"I am very grateful at the reports
coming in concerning the mobilization
of the National Guard. Everything
seems to be moving satisfactorily and
I believe the Oregon troops will make a
record for getting ready quickly ana ef
ficiently. "I understand that a considerable
number of new men are needed. Right
here in Salem the company is asking
for 50 more men. I am told that 10
men enlisted in the first 10 minutes,
which certainly shows the proper spirit.
In this connection there is one import
nut matter which should be placed
squarely before the attention of every
Oregon employed. ' The boys who en
list and give up their positions should
be assured of getting them back when
they come homo.
'Not only that, but where needs be,
I think employers would do well to help
out the families of enlisted men who
might need such help. The least that
those who do not go can do for those
who do is to assure them that their
jobs will be open when they return."
750 Mexican Soldiers
Arrive at Laredo
Laredo, Texas, June 10. Seven hun

paraded the streets. An anti-American
demonstration is said to have been pre
vented by General Garza, Carranza
commander. After Mayor Gonzales
had addressed a crowd, stating that
Mexico was on the verge of war with
the I'nited States, Garza informed the
.same crowd that the mayor's state
ments were premature and threatened

ed. A trninlond of coast artillery from
Fort Hancock, X. J., is due here to

WILL NOT WITHDRAW
Washington, June 19. The
American reply to Carranza's
last note on withdrawal of the
United States forces will be en
route to the de facto govern
ment beforo night.
In clear, unmistakable lan
guage, the note declines to
withdraw the American forces
and answer Carranza's mis
statement of fact and points to
many incidents which make it
imperative that the Pershing ex
pedition remain. The message
is 10,000 words or more. Lans
ing would not make it public for
afternoon papers today, but stot
eu he would set a releaso time
this afternoon.
Thinks He Can Send Troops
Across Border Without
Waiting for Congress
Washington, June 19. National
guurdsmen may be sent across the Mex
ican bordor without further congres
sional action in the opinion of Senator
Chamberlain of the senate militia uf
tuirs committee.
So confident is he of this that he
does not intend to ask congress to grant
further appraval of the authorization
for a step he said today.
Chamberlain bases his belief on the
ground that, in case invasion of the
b'nited Stutes is threatened, very broad
powers are allowed the president to
meet an emergency. He said he did not
doubt in the least that among these
powers is the president's right to or
der state troops into Mexicon territory
as a strategic step to prevent Mexican
aggression.
How fur the president may proceed in
such a move, however, puzzles llinni
berlain as well as moat army fficeis. I
The weight of opiiuonr is that the state
troops may not be used for a campaign
in Mexico before July 1, when the new
army law goes into effect. Before that
time militia men must take the double
oath of allegiance.
Will Pans Proper Bill.
Washington, Juno 19. Chairman
Hny of the house military affairs com
mittee, announced that he would ask
unanimous consent this afternoon for
the passage of the war department's
resolution advancing enactment of the
section of the new nrmy'bill permitting
use of militin on foreign soil.
If unanimous consent is not grnnted
by the house, Hny will obtain, through
his party's majority, a special rule to
put the matter through with all speed.

After reading the communication.
Secretary Lansing .refused in anyway
to discuss -its contents.
It was said tho message was a "re

Neither tho secretarv nor General
f'rowder would discuss tho stiip. Other
officers, members of the general staff,
insisted if was merely a "precaution

was admittedly teeming with the wild
est possibilities and that evory effort
would be made to be completely pre

Admitting the gravity of th situa

Mexico Badly Excited .o
"There is more excitement and irri

tato the trouble that every official

Announcement that the note would
go today was made after the Mexican
embassy had delivered a genet note
to Lansing.
Consul John R. Silliman is en route
for the border leaving the interior ot
Mexico without any full American con
suls in charge.
War department officials today ex
pressed (ratification over reports from
railroads of the country as to ability

tion of militia. These reports would
not be muile public but officials de
clared the railroad problem the least
of their difficulties.
Several mniitifs ago official ex
plained, this transportation question
was discussed and plans laid for just
such an emergency.
The situation was further complicat
ed when Mexican Ambassador Desig

of Slate Lansing a request that all Am

be instructed not to disembark, "dur

they are unarmed in order to prevent

Senator Arredondo said he had tele

his first chief to be sure to get the

particular attention to the fact thai the
militia was for border duty.
The request regarding nnvnl com

a result of a clash recently between
