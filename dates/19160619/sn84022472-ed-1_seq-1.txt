Citizen Soldiers of United States Prepare to En

partmentMore Than 100,000 "National
4- Guardsmen of the States , Under Arms
Bridgeport Militiamen Not Called Into Ac
tive Service Because of Nature of Their Du
ties in Defense of the Coast.
Washington, June 19 Not since the Spanish war has the
nation seen such military activity as today. More than 100,-,
000 National Guardsmenin 45 states were under arms to
..(mobilize for Mexican serviee. They constitute virtually the
entire mijitia strength of the United States. :
President Wilson through the war department issued the
orders yesterday when it became, evident the threatening sit-1
iuation. in northern Mexico was not improving. Only drilling
Viand recruiting will be in order among military organizations
for the present.
Additional warships alsov were getting ready today to
1 hurry South and stand by Mexican ports to protect Amer
icans Secretary Daniels, after the military order was issued
last night ordered seven destroyers and nine other naval ves
; sels to join theXAmerican w,aiships already in Mexican
waters. No offensive attack ' on Mexico is contemplated.
I President Wilson only wants stronger forces to defend the
border against the bandit raids and to be prepared should
, ;, Carranza troops carry out their threats to strike at American
forces engaged in chasing bandits south of the border.
Unofficial reports pceived here to
day Indicated that national guards
are mobilizing with, zest in each state
a.no5 the District of Columbia.
... Texas, New1 Mexico and Arizona
guardsmen are already at .their bor
der under call issued several weeks
ago.
Gen. Funston, commanding border
forces, will determine when the mi
litia organizations shall be 'dispatch
ed from their home states and - to
what parts, along the' border.
While these troops "were getting
jready today war department' officials
vere awaiting anxiously news . of
Whether Maj. Anderson's squadron of
cavalry was attacked by Carranza
soldiers during a successful bandit
-chase souh. of the Rio Grande Satur
day. . -
Secretary Baker reiterated the
statement that none of the guards
men affected by the new order would
be sent to the border until General
Funston states where and when he
wanted them. The men will be held
at state mobilization ' points until
mustered Into the Federal service. If
- the entire force is not immediately
desired for border service the units
i not sent South probably will be
granted a furlough until such time as
CONNECTICUT COAST ARTILLERY
MAY BE HELD AT FORT WRIGHT,
AFTER MOBILIZATION THURSDAY
i BEhile - none of the local military
organizations are affected by the call
to the cofors which President Wilson
has issued1 and which Governor Hoi
comb confirmed today, yet local, offi
cers are of the opinion that once the
the Connecticut Coast Artillery corps
is mobilized at Fort H. G. , Wright it
may be held there for an indefinite
period. The three local companies,
band and medical corps leave Bridge
port Thursday morning for the 10
days' joint .manoeuvers with regular,
troops -which take place every sum
mer. The order for the summer
camp calls the artillerymen into the
service from June 22 until July 1
Inclusive, but this tour of duty may
be continued1 if more troops are need
ed than those specified in the presi
dent's call.
v The Connecticut .' Coast Artillery
coast artillery of the regulars, is
trained and equipped as infantry, and
If necessary can take the field in that
branch of the- service. More than
25,000 men are' trained in Coast Ar
tillery work in the National Guard of
the several states who can easily be
called for duty as infantrymen and
who are as well trained in ; that
branch of the service as the . infantry
men themselves. -
Governor Holcomb announced to
day that tomorrow he would probably
Issue an order for the mobilization
. of the Connecticut quota. He was in
' conference with Adjutant-General
George M. Cole regarding plans for
providing " ' transportation of the
troops to the rendezvous camp at
Niantio. '
- Local officers of the National Guard
have been expecting a call for- duty
for some time past and in anticipa
tion of this a system of summoning
- all members of the various companies
baa been worked out by the company
commanders. The plan was for each
captain to call his lieutenants on the
phone at their place of business or
homes at whatever . hour the call
came, . ,
The lieutenants in turn would sum.

they may be required to relieve the

It is certain, however, that the en
tire force, the minimum . strength
which will be upwards of 100,000
men, will be held under arms for two
weeks or a month while the pro
cesses of muster into the Federal ser

"There is little likelihood that the!

"However,, the Coast Artillery com

If the proceedure ef 1898 at the out
break of the Spanish war is follow
ed., all company commanders in the
Connecticut Guard will be ordered to
recruit up to war strength. All of
the Bridgeport companies 'have lees
than 65, the number allowed by re
cent order of the adjutant-general. If
ordered to recruit to war strength this
number will be increased to 109 men
and three- officers for each company.
In the event of such a recruiting
order Mayor Clifford B. Wilson will be

Civic Body Requests Public
Statement Regarding Ex
- tension to Nichols.
On the ground that definite assur
ances are due the public from the
Connecticut Co. ' as to what the cor
poration intends to do toward improv
ing transportation facilities in Bridge
port, the Chamber of Commerce
transportation- committee today sent
a communication, to the company stat
ing that it believes the people should
be acquainted with the plans for bet
terment, f ,
The document was . addressed to
George E. . Hill, trustee of . the com
pany. . It amounted to a firm request
for a statement. of the company's po
sition on the following:
Extension, of service to Nich
ols. Relief of congestion in the busi
ness district.
Improving interu-rhan service.
The need of the Nichols line is im
perative, the Chamber- of Commerce
communication says' and in view of
the fact that the company promised
a prompt extension, after getting the
franchise, some definite Information
should be given tbe public.
Changes in car stops in the busi
ness center are recommended. The
communication says business is being
driven away from Main street and
Fairfield avenue by the congestion.
Trustee Hill, in a. statement to The
Farmer, declared, on the Nichols line
project, that the company's policy is
now the "conservation, improvement
and perfection of the system," 'rather
than of extension. ,
He declares, speaking unofficially,
that he believes there will be no objec
tion, but rather quick acquiescence, to
the plan for stop changes.
The Chamber of Commerce com
munication follows:
June 19, 1916.
Mr. George E. Hill, Trustee, ,
The Connecticut Company,
502 Security Building, .
City.
Dear Sir: The rapid increase in
population and the unprecedented
growth and development of , the out
lying sections of Bridgeport during
the past eighteen months have placed
an unusual burden upon all the re
sources of the city and have pre
sented problems which can be solved
only by cooperative action of all the
public and private agencies of the
city. One of the most serious- of
these problems is the local transpor
tation situation. The Transportation
Committee, of the Chamber of Com
merce has given careful thought to
this problem, and, relying upon the
cooperation of the Connecticut Com
pany, in the belief that definite as
surances are due to the public from
the Connecticut Company with re
gard to its present plans for the ex
tension of service in the outlying dis
trict of the city and for improve
ments in methods of operation, re
spectfully requests such definite in
formation from the Trustees of the
company as may properly be given
to the public at this time. The
Committee believes that it is of pri
mary importance that the public be
advised of the Intentions of the Con
necticut Company with regard to the
contemplated extension of service to
Nichols on the line for which fran
chise is now held by the company,

the library in the heart of the busi
ness section. Policemen were pa
trolling beats only a few hundred
feet away, yet so far as can be ascer
tained only one person heard the ex
plosion. The burglars made a clean getaway
and the evidence of their crime was
not discovered until the clerks arriv
ed . at the postoffice at 6 o'clock this
morning.
The burglars are believed to have
concealed themselves in the lobby of
the building when the office 'closed
at 6 o'clock Sunday evening. They
opened a door leading into the post
office by means of a jimmy and in a
similar manner pried open the gen
eral delivery window beyond which
a safe stood. The craftsmen did
their work so thoroughly that none
knew the safe was disturbed. Both
doors of the safe were blown from
their hinges. 'The booty secured by
the burglars amounts to $1,091.76. of
which $250 was in cash and the re
mainder in postage stamps.

pend operations for similar reasons
are the -carpenters, painters and dee
oratorsV lathers and electrical work
ers. . Though the force that quit work is
not numerically strong today, being
probably less than 100 men, the ac
tion of the four trades means a seri
ous blow to building operations, as the
process is a slow but sure way of ty
ing up all work done under- so-called
unfair conditions.
It ?s said by labor officials today that
this radical action comes after a notifi
cation and parley with builders ex
tending from May 1, and that if con
tinued in force as expected and against
other builders now on the list of un
fair employers of labor, nearly 5,000
men will be on strike before July 1.
HARRAL OBTAINS
DUNHAM ESTAT
ON GOLDEN HILL
Retired Manufacturer Buys
Historic Building, Near
ly Century Old.
ONCE COMMANDED
VIEW QP THE SOUND
Residents Taking Rapid
Steps to Conserve Dis
trict for Homes.
In the project to perpetuate Golden
Hill as a. residential section of Bridge
port, a movement which is headed by
Edward W. Harral and members of
the Wheeler family, another strategic
point was won .today when Mr. Har
ral purchased the Dunham property at
360 Golden Hill street, corner of Harri
son. ,
This historic- old building, of modern
appearance yet in the same condition
as when built nearly 100 years ago,
has recently been the keystone in the
arch raised by several prospective
realty transactions of importance, in
cluding' the new sites for the Young
Women's Christian . association build
ing and the University club.
What influence this purchase by Mr.
Harral, who has indicated his inten
tiorf of remodeling the Dunham prop
erty and continuing it as a residence,
will have upod the Y. W. C. A. plans
which were set upon acquisition of the
present University club site, is 1 not
known today.
In realty circles there is a pending
belief that the University club will
now find another site acceptable to the
governors and that the X. W.s C. A.
will be able to acquire the old' club
site.
Mr. Harral and his associates, with
the Star Shirt factory as a nucleus,
fhave acquired all that block bounded
by Harrison street' Washington ave
nue and Golden Hill street, and else
where on Golden Hill street, have
many individual holdings that will
tend' to restrict 'any business enter
prise that might be tempted to pur
chase in that vicinity.
Little of the original history of the
Dunham estate is known today, old
maps failing to show ownership in de
tail, ft is known, however, that early
in the last century, a rich New Yorker
was charmed by the site with its view
up and down Long Island sound and
built the mastve stone house on the
eminence and adjoining the old In
dian reservation.
Phile Kurd in turn ' purchased it
about 90 years ago, the property then
commanding nearly the whole block
bounded by Harrison, Courtland, Gol
den Hill and Beaver streets. Harri
son street at that time did not exist.
The bounary of the property was on
the Elijah Waterman property and
eBaver street is now known as Fair
field avenue.
The property descended by bequest
to J. E. Dunham and others and to
day is occupied by Miss Clara Dunham
and two sisters who have sold to Mr.
Harral. The consideration is not di
vulged. During the last 50 years much of
the original estate lias been sold, in
cluding what is known aa the Golden
Hill hotel and Keeler properties.
