mono FIGHT
New Officers Have. Been
Chosen and Remnant of
Army Again Equipped.
Salonikl. Greece. June 19.. The allied
offensive in Macedonia, originally
scheduled for midday and postponed on
account of the condition of the Servian
army on its arrival in Corfu, is now
confidently anticipated toward the end
of June, or at the latest, early in July.
The activities of the Bulgarians east
uA ctMimltM Inst week Ami thA
gradual extension of artillery operations
' have led to the assumption from time to
time that Gen. Sarrail's plans might be
hastened and the allied attack begun at
once.
The outbreak of cholera among the
Servians on their arrival on Corfu I
proved a mixed disadvantage. It made
their transport to Salonlki in time to
participate in an offensive in May im
possible. Moreover, it reduced their
numbers materially. A great many more
Serbs died than will ever be known,
not simply of cholera but from entero
gastritis, malnutrition and sheer ex
haustion. Had to Chance Flans.
The Servian army was in far worse
shape after its retreat through Albania
than had been supposed. The entire
force needed full reequlpment and the
recruits from Servia and the volunteers
from America required drilling. Mar
shal Putnik was no longer physically
able to command and many of the lead
ing officers were dead or too worn by
their last narasnips to continue, ana a
new set or officers had to be chosen
An alteration in the general plan of the
allies had to be made. Instead? of strik
insa. first blow in the Balkans to draw
off the German reserves from the west
front, while a decisive action was be
ing planned in France, It was decided to
make the Macedonian offensive of the
allies coincide with. Instead of pre
cede, the general allied offensive on all
fronts, generally supposed to be sched
uled for midsummer.
130.000 In Macedonia.
There are now 130.000 first class Sar
vian troops In Macedonlo. Already they
have begun to take their positions on
the frontiers of their native land, from
the Vardar west to lake Prespa. Some
objection was at first raised to the oc
cupation of the first line trenches by
the Serbs. It was said that the Serbs
had suffered enough and that every
Servian in good physical condition was
needed to establish the Servian race, so
near annihilated by the present as the
two previous wars. On this point, prince
regent Alexander was firm. "How can
we reenter our father land?" he said to
the Associated Press- correspondent,
"save as- conquerors? Of what avail
would it be to perpetuate a race content
to let others do their fighting? The off
spring of one Serb who has been a hero
Is worth a hundred of those who being
able to fight, have stopped at home."

Chance for Boys
, To Join Y. M. C. A.
A CHANCE to start right is to be given to the live, wide awake boys
of 1 Paso. The 1 Paso Herald lias arranged to boy meimjerships
for boys in the Young Men's Christian association, which it will give
for a little effort in pleasant work.
Think what it will mean to you to become a part owner of this won
derful plant for boys and men, where you can go for healthful exercise and
recreation, and swim to your heart's content. What boy but likes th "old
swimming, hole," and here they have the finest swimming hole yoa ever
saw, tile lined, 20x60 feet, filled with dear, coM water.
The El Paso Herald realizes what it means for the growing boy to have
the advantage of supervised play and recreation for the growing boy. It
means a strong body, with vim and vigor, and when given under the right
auspices it means healthy morals as well.
In this way, the Herald wants to cooperate with the fathers and
mothers of the city in giving their boys the best the city has and to bring
it within the reach of 'all. To this end we have arranged for a limited num
ber of these memberships to be given to certain boys free, for a little work
on their part.

manager, H. H. Fris. Come at once and get an early start, otherwise your

While more than 100,099 na
tional guardsmen and probably
145,09, were today mobilizing In ac
cordance with the war department's or
der, the war department drafted a res
olution making effective immediate'.?
the provision of the new army b u
whereby national guardsmen taking
I the. oath as Bn4td .stales mr vol
j uateers would he aaJfable for service
at oaee anywhere. Chalrmban Hay. of
the boose military committee, helped
draft the bill and it is to be presented
to congress as soon as possible.
The resolution would pat into Imme
diate effect section 111 of the new army
bill, which will not become effective un
der its own terms until July L It au
thorizes tne president to draft all mem
bers of the national guard or national
guard reserves in his discretion when
, congress shall have authorised the use
of the armed forces of the country.
As onl yoongress has the power to de
clare war, the president could use the
guardsmen even under this section only
for repelling invasion. It is held,
however, that the militia may be
sent across the international line, if
necessary, in the operation of defending
American territory. Section 111 saya:
Wording of Section.
"All persons so drafted Fhall, from
date of their draft, stand discharged
from the militia and shall from said
date be subject to such laws and regu
lations as may be applicable to mem
bers of the volunteer army."
Medical Reservists Called In.
The section also provides that offi
cers of the forces so drafted, above the
rank -of colonel, shall be appointed by
the president, while lower officers shall
be selected from the personnel of the
farce.
Steps were takes today to call in the
service the doctors of the medical re
serve corps.
Troops Rally All Over V. S.
Not since the Spanish-American war
has the nation seen such military activ
ity as now. More than 100.000 national
j guardsmen in 4S states were mobilizing
' ""ice. They constitute
j virtually the entire militia strength of
the United States. President Wilson.
: through secretary of war Baker Issued
orders when it became apparent that
the threatening conditions in northern
Mexico were not improving.
Brig. Gen Alfred Mills, chief of the
division of militia affairs estimated the
minimum militia force to be called out
to be 14S.0O6 men.
Only drilling and recruiting will be m
order among militia roganizations for
the present, and there is now a rush of
recruits to the colors. All militia must
be mustered into federal service. Later
