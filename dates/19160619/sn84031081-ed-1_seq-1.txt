London, June IS (3:T.9 u. m.) The
whole brunt of the first onslaught on
Lutsk fell on two divisions, of which
only sorry remnants survived, ac
cording to Austrian prisoners, says a
neuter's Pelrograd dispatch. After1
the destruction of these divisions the
Russians poured through the Austrian
lines, menacing the rear of Archduke
Joseph Ferdinand's fourth army. This
necessitated tho precipitate evacuation
of the whole Lutsk region.
The day on which General Hrusl
loff's movement began, has the dis
patch, chanced to be the sixtieth birth
day of Archduke Frederick, the commander-in-chief
of the Austrian army,
who came to Archduke Ferdinand's
staff headquarter at Lutsk in order
to celebrate the occasion with tho
army. Lutsk was gaily bef lagged
with the Austrian and Hungarian col
ors and there were illuminations in
the evening. Archduke Frederick ex
tolled tin ' valor and prowess of the
soldiers, whom he exhorted to fresh
victories, which he declared would
soon bring them to a long and happy
I peace.
"Iioth archdukes," continues the
dispatch, "were among the gayest of
tho gay, sublimely unconscious of the
