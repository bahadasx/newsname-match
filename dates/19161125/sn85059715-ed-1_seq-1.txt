was in session only a few minutes this
morning but long enough to pass the
registration bill by a vote of 18 to 9
as it was amended yesterday. A number
of Democrats explained their
votes, Morton saying it was worse than
the bill now on the boohs.
It was expected the resolution calling
for an investigation of the charges
made in the governor's speech yesterday
would be introduced but the ,
Senate recessed until 3 o'clock without j
its being mentioned.
The House was quickly passing the ,
three Senate bills which prescribe ;
the manner, determining contests for :
1 elective officers; prescribe the man- i
