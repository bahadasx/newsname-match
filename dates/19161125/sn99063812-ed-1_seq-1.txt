JtUMAXIAN DKFEXSES
AFTER FOURTFEN
YEARS OF SERVICE
For fourteen years, with the excep
tion of one six-months term, George1
Humphrey, recently elected as sheriff I
of Klamath county, has acte'd as;
secretary of Klamath Lodge No. 137,
I. O. O. F., and this long term of ser-J
vice is but one indication of the effl-.
ciency with which he has served the
popular order.
Since his election as sheriff, how
ever, Mr. Humphrey has considered
that his duties' in the new office would
demand so much of his time hewoti'.d
be unable to do the lodge justice as
its secretary, and declined re-nomina-j
tion when tendered.
Last night was reeular election of
officers of Klamath Lodge, and the'
following were chosen to guide the!
destinies throueh the Januarv-Julv.
1917, term:
Noble Grand W. D. Cofer.
Vice Grand Morris Leslie.
Treasurer P, L. Fountain.
