ELECTRICAL AND SHOP
EARLY WEEK: PROMOTED
BY COMMERCIAL CLUB
l !
The Advertising Committoo of th
Commercial Club is promoting thi
American Electrical and Shop Earlj
Week hlch Is from-Decembor 2nd
to tho 9th. Every merchant will bo
asked to mako special Christmas
window decorations and sales In or
der to start tho Christmas spirit and
to avoid such a rush Just before tho
holidays. Tho Idea Is to get the
people to do their Christmas shop
ping early and to Impress tho public
with tho wonderful strides made in
electricity. The lelectrlc companies
all over the United States will take
a very active part during this week
to display all sorts of electrical de
vices and to Impress the people how
electricity Is used.
Tho electrical business in the Unit
ed States has grown from nothing
to something over eight billion dol
lars Inside a generation. Tho princi
pal reasons for this are, first, tho
people have demanded Improved
methods fordoing things. Electricity
has furnished these methods. Nec
essity is tho mother of Invention.
Electricity has speeded up tho wheels
of thi world's commerce. Its In
ventlons have found popular accep
tance In tho factory, homo store,
office and on, tho farm. Tho second
reason lis enterprise. Tho scientists,
engineers and commercial men, have
workodj tirelessly with but ono aim.
They sought to bring electrical appli
ances and service, tho tolophone, tho
motor, tho electric lamp, to a degreo
of perfection such as to mako them
at once, useful and beneficial to ev
erybody. The purpose of Amorlca's Electri
cal Week Is to tell from coast to
Coast, city to city, countryside to
countryside, the message "Do it Elec
trically.;' Seventy per cent of the people of
thls country use electricity In somo
,form or other every day of their
lles. How can they uso more? How
can thoy use It oftonor? Amorlca's
Electrical Week will help thorn to
find It oyt.
Tho Entertainment committee has
also arranged t ohavo the Commun
ity Christmas tree on exhibition in
front of tho Tabernaclo during tho
Electrical and Shop Early Week.

of both attack and dofonso.
Not a great doal Is known of tho

ing fracas. In previous years tho
University of Idaho eloven has beon
touted as ono of tho strong elovons

to Injuries and other hard luck she

Injuries received in tho Montana
gamo has considerably weakened tho
Agglo Hno-up for a tlmo. Tho men
