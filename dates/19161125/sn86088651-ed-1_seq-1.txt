Return to Country If Living Cost
Found to Be Too High.
Austin. Texas, Nov. 25. Governor
Ferguson has no sympathy with the
present movement to reduce the price
of foodntuffs and declares he will not
tske a hand In It. Thn governor said
that If food prices should be reduced
it would be at the expense of the
farmer and that he waa not willing
that tho farmer should lose any of
his well earned prosperity. He said
that the middleman Is going to take
rare of his oan Intercuts.
The governor declared that the
fnrmer la Just now ccmtng Into his
own. that a few years ago when the
farmer was getting 8 rente a ound for
his cotton no meetlnga were held In
the cities to boost the price of cotton.
One of the reasnna why prices are
high, tho governor said. Is that toi
large a percentage of the people have
drifted lo the cltlea. The product of
tho farm relative to the population
hbh consumes It Is red tied and high
prices follow as a consequence.
The governor suggested that the
loafera In thn cities go lo the country
and help produce an abundance of
foodsluffs. lie said that there la an
abundance of good land In Texas and
there la no occasion for alarm lest
Texas shall not be able lo support Its

many good plays executed by the
ilryan boys, for they were all good.
Bryan Con the toss and chose to de

to Parker, who returned 15 yards,
making the first down on Aryan's 20
yard line. From that moment began
a series of brilliant plays by Iiryan

the Iiryan team was a line plunge
through the left tackle. Every player
on the team well deserves special
mention for effective work. Both on
the offensive and defensive the whole
team worked as a unit and were alert
: to every opportunity to advance the
j ball when in their possession and to
; Impede Its progress when in tbe pos-
I pen next. The first three quarters of
the game resulted In a acoreless tie.
but during the last minute of play
the Iiryan boys put place kick
through the goal posts after having
advanced the ball to Calvert's 6 yard
line. The goal was kicked from the
12 yard line by Harry Crenshaw with
many times thrown for losses. The
work of Park. Parker and Harry Cren
shaw In the back field, and of llanna,
Hall, Scardlno and K. Crenshaw In the
line, deserres special mention. Cloud
did brilliant work In the back field
until he was disabled In tbe second '
quarter.
