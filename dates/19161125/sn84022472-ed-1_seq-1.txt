VOTERS STAYING
AWAY, CHARTER
ISN'T ADOPTED
Commission Plan , Leaders
Admit Defeat WhenMid
, . day Figure is Obtained.
' :
Thanks to a concerted effort of the
Republican administration leaders to
kill the Commission Government
charter, to the compilation of which
"prominent citizens have given months
of their time," it became apparent this
afternoon that the electorate had not
turned out; in sufficient numbers to
adopt the charter.
Leaders of the Commission Govern
ment union at noon checked up the
number voting' in each district and
found that 3,000 votes had been cast
this morning. They were sanguine
of success early today but they found
no rush of voters to the polls.
As an, evidence of the treachery
to the electorate,- it was learned, that
many city officials hadn't left their of
fices' to" vote today. Whether any of
the Republican office holders did vote
could not;be learned. . r .
' There are 21,687 voters in the city
and: under ' the Home Rue act .a 60
per cent, vote is necessary at an elec
toon for a change in city govern
ment. This would require 13,013 bal
lots registered before the vote would
be valid.
-At " press hour; although willing to
admit that the charter would ' hot
pass, workers at the headquarters of
the Commission Government union
said' fully ,8,000 would, be polled. Re
ports from -different districts at 2
o'clock indicated that a few more
than 5,000 votes had been cast and
that , the total vote for the day would
be ln the neighborhood: of 6,000. At
2bclocK today the union headquar
ters claimed 9 GO votes had 'been cast
in the Ninth .district and '4,00 in the
Fourth - district. " . :
Thelvote during .the early forenoon
was unusually light' and' 11 Vclbck it.
was apparent that only about 8,000
had gone to the polls. . Members of
the- Commission Government union,
still, undismayed : by. the light vote,
then began making strenuous efforts
to get vout the electorate; Committees
working in each district in the inter
est of the : adoption of the new x char
ter were offered free-use of automo
biles 'by., leading citizens who have
endorsed the proposed new charter
but General Apathy, that old enemy
of Good Government, seemed firmly
entrenched.- - "
Behind the apparent indifference of
the voters, however, there was evi
dence of an k organized movement to
defeat the charter by keeping voters
away from the polls x Men who have
never been known to miss voting' be
fore except because of serious illness,
remained away from the polls, going
about their business as usual. When
asked why they wo-uld not vote , they
simply shrugged their shoulders and
smiled.' v I - ...-
Men. who for years. have been con
spicuous figures about- the polling
places 6n election day, no . matter
what the .election, were conspicuous
by their absence this time. , -i
Inquiry about the. men prominent
in the Republican clubs and " their
lack of attraction, ' although the Re
publican party has endorsed com
mission, form of government, brought
the information that these men were
working or had gone to v the football
game or left town for other purposes.
Few firemen and fewer policemen
registered their votes. Mayor Wlson
and City Clerk Robinson left thev city
early , f or the football game at New
Haven and it could not be ascertain
ed, whether or not they. voted. .None
of the other Republican city officials
at city hall today voted nor did any
of the . clerks who are -known tobe.
Republicans. '
In the Fifth district the committee
pf the Commission Government league
was mostactiye and got out the larg
est vote. In this district many of the.
advocates of the measure reside. At
11 o'clock today, howeverj.' only 659
of the 2,588 voters of the district had
been to the polling place. .
At about" the same hour the vote
in the other districts of the city show
ed about as follows:
First -district,-. 189; ' Second, " 151;
Third, 133; Fourth, 163; -Fifth, 659;
Sixth, 190; Seventh, 225; Eighth,. 160;
Ninth, 400; Tenth 156; Eleventh, 135;
Twelfth, "First precinct, "168; Second
precinct, 129. ' .
, When .it became- apparent 'today
that the voters were not coming out
and the charter would not be adopted,
leaders in the Commission Govern
ment union at once , 'began :' making
plans for another campaign. . . -
"We will take this to Hartford and
to the legisalture," declared ' John
Flood, one of the most active of . com
mission government advocates. "We
will have a special train the day' this
charter is presented for action and we
will take 1,000 or more there to march
to the capitol and protest against this
invisible government that is In force
now. I have broached this plan to
other members of the union and they
are enthusiastic over it.. One prom
inent manufacturer has told me to
come to him for his check for $500 to
defray expenses anytime we are
ready." ' '
The Keystone Utilities oC, of Do
ver, Del., was incorporated wt a

GRAPHOPHONE GO.
Police Declare Organized
Thieves' Band Has Divid
ed $50,000.
TWO UNDER ARREST
AS GANG MEMBERS
Records, Graphophones, Mo
tors and Other Material
Missing.
An organized gang of thieves work
ing as employes of the American
Graphophone Co., for the last six
months, consistently have looted the
factory of the concern, of costly elec
tric motors, records and various talk
ing machine parts, stealing in all
goods with a market value exceeding
550,000. ,
Two men aro under arrest charged
with conspiracy to steal, and the ap
prehension of four' or five others, who,
the police assert are implicated, is im
minent. The arrested men are: Tim
othy Sullivan, 25 years of age, of 60
Bostwick avenue, and Royal Sapp,
alias Cisnaros, 24 years, of 93 ' Butler
avenue. Sullivan admits his guilt, ac
cording to the police.
For six months the officials ' of the
company have- been baffled by the
continued wholesale theft of goods.
Three and , four days a week, great
quantities of electric motors, nickel
plated discs, machine needles, records
and tie many varied pieces of mech
anism, used in assembling high priced
phonographs, dictaphones, dictagraphs
and other machines, were missed.
About a month ago the police as
signed Detective Thomas F. Malone to
the case. After a week of investiga
tion his suspicions fell upon Sullivan,
who worked each night as , a quasi
watchman and shipper until 9 o'clock.
Malone found' he was friendly with
Sapp, who had not worked for more
than six months, was always well
supplied with money, and -left this city
weekly with dress suit cases of large
size, for New -York.
Sullivan, according to the police,
was trusted by the officials of the fac
tory and never was suspected of any
part in the robberies. He would as
semble the goods in the , shipping
room, wait until the other watchman
had passed through the department,
when he would open the window and
pile the'motors and other goods on
the ground outside the factory. His
accomplice's would packt it into disss
suit cases ad cart it away.
Sapp, accorlng to . the police, was
the disposer of -the goods. When a
load had been stolen it would be car
ried to his home, packed into other
cases and ' he would go to New York
and dispose of it. - Three weeks ago a'
pile of records, the whole value" of
which totalled $400, was found: by
the regular , watchman, lying on the
t sidewalk."; " "
x Malone waited for the acocmplices
to carry it away "but they evidently
had been scared off. During Sapp's
absence from his room the next day
Malone searched the apartment, and
found in an overcoat 'a note "which
read, "Put out the records tonight"
He neglected arresting Sapp until
more conclusive evidence could be
obtained.
He found that" Sapp a .few days
before the finding of the note, had
been to New York and left here with
three dress suit, cases, one being
filled with goods so heavy that the
handle was ripped off.
Last Wednesday another load: of
goodsSvas missed. , Yesterday' morn
ing Malone went directly to Sapp's
room. The place resembled a ma
chine shop. 'Tons of arm attach
ments, motors with nickel " plated
disks attached, electric units, a gold
plated graphonola, valued at $125,
43 boxes of needles worth wholesale
$129, and other goods . recovered, to
taling in. value $667, the latter price
being the cost only of manufacture.
Sapp was arrested In bed and taken
to police headquarters. Malone then
went immediately to the factory and
arrested Sullivan at 10 o'clock in the
morning. The - police searched Sul
livan's home and found 30 records and
a valuable talking machine in the
house. He claims he bought these.
The police foud also that , he 'had
cut the seam in the bottom of his
overcoat pocket, evidently foe the pur
pose of carrying out records and small
parts of. the machines, thrusting , his
hand clear through 'the - pocket and
hiding the goods under his coat. Sul
livan admitted that he had taken the
goods to Sapp's rooms, but refused
to tell the names of other men impli
cated. Sapp denied that he had ever be
fore received any stolen . goods and
disclaimed knowing any reason for
Sullivan placing them in hlsi room.
Sullivan's young wife at polico head
quarters, soon to become a. mother,
and who was married about, a- yeai;
ago in this city, grew hysterical when
told her husband had. admitted steal
ing the goods. ' She was heartbrckeu
and said she could not understand Jaev
husband's conduct. V
The value of the theft of one night's
robbery, $667, is merely the factory
cost. An approximate of the total
value of .the goods stolen may be gain
ed from trie fact that the company
recently in court admitted that they
sold some records" that cost seven and
some: 13 cents to manufacture. The
goods representing one night's rob
bery could be retailed for neariy $2,
000. It Is claimed by the police that
loads of stuff were taken from the
factory three and four days each
week, for at least six months.
Effort is being made to' find out
where Sapp disposed of the stolen
property in New York. Thus far he
denies having sold any of the stolen
eroods, although the police say they
have knowledge that he went to New
York every week to sell goods.
Both young men have been in this
city about one year, and came here
