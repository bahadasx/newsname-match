Athens. Nov. 25. The Greek pro

ly declared war against Bulgaria.
Venizelos established a revolution
ary or -'provisional" government of
Greece on the island of Crete some
weeks ago. The former premier first
clashed with King Constantine be
cause of Venizelos' vigorous pro-ally
war views and his insistence that
Greece cast her lot against Germany.
At the Greek elections Venizelos
apparently obtained support in this
position from the people, but he failed
to move the Greek monarch to any
change in his attitude of neutrality.

MARRY SUNDAY SCHOOL PUPIL
Girl He Taught in Girard Ap
pealed to Gov. Capper.
Thanksgiving Wedding Follows
Christmas Parole.
Governor Capper today paved the
way for the culmination of a Sunday
school romance of a former murder
convict, when he granted citizenship
papers to Steve McDowell of Girard.
McDowell was paroled two years ago
after serving a sentence for second
degree murder. Now he is to marry
Miss Frances Austin, a pupil in his
Girard Bible class.
McDowell won his citizenship today
when an appeal was received from his
oriae-to-De. Miss-Austin told the gov-
"nor mat since his release trom
prison, McDowell has been instructor
ln a snday schooi and Bible class at
Girard. He has made an excellent
record since leaving the orison the
w-oman slated. As a result of McDow-
Two years McDowell received a
Christmas parole at the hands of Gov
ernor Hodges. He was one of several
murder convicts who were released by
tne iormer Democrat governor.
The
men were given unristmas paroles,
were dressed out the day before
Christmas and spent Christmas day in
their former homes. Shortly after he
left prison, McDowell joined a church
in Girard and has since conducted a
Bible class. The young woman whom
he now plans to marry was one of his
students. It is probable the couple
will be married Thanksgiving day. Be
fore the ceremony could be performed,
however, it was necessary that Mc
Dowell receive citizenship papers.
These papers were signed by the gov
ernor today following an investigation
of the case, started when the letter
was received from McDowell's sweet
heart. TTp for Murder.
McDowell went to the penitentiary
for a murder committed in Cherokee
county more than ten years ago. He
was convicted of second degree murder
and was sentenced to a term of ten to
twenty years. An excellent prison
record, backed by a showing of un
usual bravery in the prison fire of
April 1913, won lor the man his Christ
mas parole.

ARMY-NAVY GAME
Service Schools Clash In An

Many Notables in New York for
Big Gridiron Battle.
Polo Grounds, New York, Nov. 25.
The first period of the Army vs. Navy
game here today ended with the score
9 to 0 in favor of the Army team. The
West Pointers appeared to outclass the
Middies. Oliphant, who is the leading
scorer, in the college ranks this sea
son, scored the first touchdown in less
than two minutes after the kickoff,
carrying the ball from his own five
yard line to within five yards of the
Navy goal.
Two more plays carried it over.
After an exchange of kicks he scored
again with a placement kick from the
20-yard mark.
New York. Nov. 25. One of the
largest crowds that ever attended an
athletic event In this city sought the
Polo grounds today to see Annapolis
and West Point stage their annual
football contest. Anticipating a crush,
more than 450 policemen were detail
ed at the grounds.
President Wilson was unable to be
present, but members of his cabinet
and other high governmental officials,
in addition to many prominent repre
sentatives of both braffches of the
service added brilliancy to the as
semblage. Two battalions of cadets from West
Point, 760 men and the officers of
the post were expected to reach the
grounds shortly before the game and
give an exhibition military drill on
their way to their seats, which, this
year contrary to precedent were lo
cated on the north side of the field
Four battalions of midshipmen were
to occupy the seats on the south side.
Naval Officers Rooters.
Navy rooters will be augmented by
about 400 officers from several battle
ships of the Atlantic fleet now in the
harbor.
Secretary of War Baker was to
head the list of notables in the north
stand, while Secretary of the Navy

Aside from the spectacular interest
in the event, an unusually well con
tested game was promised. The Army
team which entered the contest with
a clean slate for the season was picked
by most of the experts to win. but
many followers of the Navy professed
confidence in the ability of their team.
Neither team had any advantage in
weight, but the army had the greater
number of seasoned veteran players.

Comerford kicked off and the pe

New Haven, Conn., Nov. 25. Clear
skies and crisp atmosphere which
made fur coats acceptable and a
westerly wind with energy enough In
it to influence the punting side of the
game, were the weather conditions to
day for the Yale-Harvard football
classic in the great Yale bowl. Crowds
of people began to poi-r into the city
before breakfast. Eighty thousand
persons, lacking a tew hundred con
sidered themselves fortunate in hav
ing obtained seats from among the
one hundred thousand who had ap
plied for reservations within the bowl.
In all the story of contests between
blue and the crimson, there has never
been so great a host of spectators.
The crowd grew from hotels where
men of wealth spent the night In un
certain rest on lounges, chairs, pool
tables and mattresses laid upon the
floors, from sleeping cars on railroad
siding, from automobiles which
stretched aong -he city streets, and
from trolley cars and railroad trains
which brought tens of thousands.

in this way for some time."

DECISIVE FIGHTING TODAY
One of Bloodiest of Mexico's
Numerous Battles.
Villa May Be Laying Plans for
Siege of City.
. Juarez Nov. 25. The Villa ban
dits again were repulsed early today
by the Carranza forces defending
Chihuahua City, according to a mes
sage received at military headquar
ters here. The message said the re
pulse was even more decisive than
those of yesterday and Thursday, tha
bandits being driven clear of the sub
urbs after desperate efforts to pene
trate to the heart of the city and take
it by storm.
Juarez, Nov. 26. Francisco Villa
and his bandit forces resumed the at
tack on Chihuahua City at daybreak
today, according to Carranza officials,
marking the opening of the third
day's fighting in Villa's effort to wrest,
the Chihuahua capital from General
Jacinto B. Trevino's constitutionalist
forces.
Communication with Chihuahua
City was still unimpaired. Indicating
the attack Was directerl from tha
southeast and southwest of the city.
Crucial Stage of BatUe.
EI Paso. Tex., Nov. 25. Reports
reaching United States government
agents here Indicated that the crucial
stage In the momentous battle for pos
session of Chihuahua City, had been
reached today.
In an attempt to force General Tre
vino, commanding the garrison, to ex
haust his ammunition supply, small
raiding parties of Villistas moved up
on advanced trenches of the defenders
during the night to draw their rifle
fire.
At the beginning of the third day of
battle between Villistas and Carran
zistas for possession of Chihuahua City,
military men here expect Villa to
make a desperate assault, upon the
northern Mexican capital. The silenc
ing of battery upon Santa Rosa hill,
commanding every part of the city, is
necessary before any buildings or po
sitions in the city can become tenable
for the attacking forces. . , -.
Shortage of Shells Feared.
The shortage of rifle ammunition
and artillery shells Is again worrying
the defacto military authorities at
Juares. One carload of artillery shells
Is being held In the yards there but
General Trevino, fearing It would fall
Into the hands of the bandits, wired:
"We have plenty of shells, do not send
it."
