BERLIN, (yJa Sayville wireless)
Nov. 26.—Successful crossing of the

The statement said:

the
Danube at Slmnitza and the Berlin
report that Fis Marshal Von Mack,
ensen has actually crossed that
stream, together with knowledge that
the Rumanian line is reformed along
the Alt valley, all hinted to military
experts here today that forces were
being drawn for one of the great
military struggles of the Balkan cam
paign.
The fact that none of the Berlin
wKcittl" itotrtnents have made any
claims of large capture of men, but
tresses the greatest hujpe nere that
Romanians in Uttle Walachla—where
Berlin reports capture of Orsova and
Tnrnu-Severin—have escaped General
Falkenhayn's encircling movement.
It is believed what force is left with
in the German vise must be a very
•mall one.
The major portion of this Rumanian
army, threatened by Von Faiken
hayn's circuitous dash, has, it is be
lieved here, retired and joined forces
along Alt river. Such a.line would
have advantage of natural defensive
positions along the river. The line
vould run nearly due north and
south and Interpose a strong barrier
to any further encroachments of the
German forces from the west toward
Bucharest. That this line has been
formed and its strength recognized
by the Teutons, is indicated, it is
believed here, in the Bulgarian at
tempt at a flanking movement at
Simnitza.
In the meantime Field Marshal Von
Mackensen, to whom military critics
assign the next step In the Teutonic
move at Bucharest, is expected to
•tart an offensive movement in Dob
rndja. Realization of this plan, it is
said, resulted in the sudden assump
tion of a strong offensive movement
by the Russians and Rumanians, re
ported yesterday. They have appar
ently made a good start. London ex
pects to see violent fighting in -this

WASHINGTON, Nov. 25. Only
General Carranza and General Villa
stood today as possible obstacles to
fruition of, the Atlantic City confer
ence agreement for withdrawal of
General Pershing's forces from Mex
ico }n the next forty days.
The American government Itself 1b
prepared to ratify the protocol, inas
much as it was shaped upon terms
President Wilson himself approved.
What General Carranza will do is a
problem, though the administration
believes he will sign It even though
it may be distasteful because of In?
elusion of provisions that U. S. troops
may follow bandits into Mexico at
any time.
Chairman Lane, back in town, was
slated to present the protocol darly,
though the president's illness seem
ed likely to preclude a conference to
day.
The protocol In brief provides for
withdrawal of American troops in
forty days if conditions in northern
Mexico permit, for American pursuit
of bandits if occasion arises for
£p='p„.,i,
to be arranged between the respective
commanders for discussion of in
ternal problems upon reconvening
December 6. Secretary Lane holds
the latter the most vital and insists
significantly that reforms of protec
tion of American rights, lives and
property must be accomplished by
Mexico either on her own initiative
or with American help—otherwise
evidently by Interference.

BALTIMORE, Md., Nov. 25.—The

Instead, the federation put the issue

Desire not to embarrass President
Wilson because of his work in forolbg

There was little discussion. The

[United Press Leased Wire Service^
AMSTERDAM, Nov. 25.—German advices today strongly deny that any but unem
ployed Belgians have been deported for employment in German factories.
It is explained that if by chance some Belgians who are actually at work have wen
included in those transported from Belgium, it is because Belgian authorities have failed to
furnish German officials wi$h proper lists of those unemployed. The German government
it is asserted, has taken 'responsible measures'' to return those Belgians erroneously de

in the manufacture of munitions, or in any other war work.
