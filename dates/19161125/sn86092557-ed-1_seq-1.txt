nen and women of the city assembled i
it the high schuol building for a con- i
erencu concerning the organization of ;
such u school. Each of the persons j
jresent signed a card which gave the '
ourse he or she desired to pursue in 1

of the signer.
The actual work of the school will
start on Tuesday. December 5. and the '
lasses will meet on two nights in each
week, on Tuesday and Thursday, the
liours being from 7:30 to 0:30. Another
meeting for tile purpose of organizing
the classes and receiving new stu
ictus will he lieltl next Tuesday evening
at tite high school building.
The greatest demand for class work '
Ity the persons at the meeting last j
night seemed to he about equally divided
among the studies of sewing, i
shop mat hematics, short hand and {
typewriting. Teachers front the high .
seliool and the ward schools will have '
charge of the class work which will j
lie under the personal supervision of
Principal ti. K. f'olchank, of the utgli
school.
Superintendent Otis U. Wilson and j
Prof. Colebank have lieen untiring iu
their efforts to promote this school for
persons who desire instruction in special

several times and a few months ago local
educators conceived the idea that
the demand for such a school was:
great enough to organize one and consequently
the approval of the Hoard
of Education and its co-operation was
obtained and the project has now become
a reality. The persons present
at the meeting last nipht are enthusiastic
concerning the organization of
the school as were also the promoters
of the project.

City Hall Notes
.In order to do the public of Fairmont
a slight lavor tlie city clerk's office
lias become a turkey brokerage office
until Thanksgiving. Already the
c ity clerk has furnished about a dozen
turkeys for farmers who have written
i r telephoned here that they have
* nls for sale. At present there are.
about la fat birds iy>t taken.
About once a month a check protecting
machine salesman visits the city
hall with the intention of selling a machine
that will not permit the city's
chocks to be raised. One of these Is
c-n hand now and all take turn about
trying to beat it.
Losing their nerve, they lost the hair

of Albert Kern and Ira Smith. Hut
Chief Horr still retains hit. nose brush
and insists that lie will wear it until
one of his boys pulls it off which bo
says may not be far away.

INVESTIGATION IS URGED
I
Governor Savs Law Makes
No Provision for Existing
Trouble.
CHARLESTON, W. Va.. Nov. 2j.?
governor Hat Held sent a special mes-1
:age to the legislature late yesterday,
calling attention to tbo charge that!
large sums of money -.vere improper- j
!y used in the election of November 7. i
In violation of the corrupt practices
let. and that there were gross violaIons
of the election and registration j
aws of the stale." He rerommended
ihc appointment of a committee, with
[towers to sit at various places, lake
icstimony, and thoroughly investigate
he charges.
The House received the message
soon after four o'clock, just before it j
adjourned. The Senate did not as-1
scmble until six o'clock at which time j
Ihe message was read. The resolu- j
ion was not introduced in either |
House.
I .ate in the afternoon the Rcpuhll-|
an senators were called to a conference
in 'he room of President England i
where they where addressed by I'ranl:;
Amos Republican chairman of Marion i
county, where, it is alleged, extensive i
frauds were perpetrated on election i
ilay. The resolution recommended by \
Ihe governor was said to have been '
discussed, and that it did not meet I
with the unanimous approval of the j
senators. The dissenting party, was j
led by Senator Ben L. Itosetihloom. of I
Wheeling. anil standing with him were j
Senators Oliver S. Marshall, of New !
f.'umherland. and Warren Miller, of
Ripley. Details of the resolution were j
said to inelude the appointment of a j
commission by the governor to whom
i partial report was to be made not
later than January.
Democrats, discussing the report,
ileclareii it was a movement to contest
the election of John J. Cornwell
is governor, and thnt they would vigorously
oppose it.
Governor llatlield's special message,
after repeating the charges of fraud |
In the late election contained in his j
first message to the special session ot j
the legislature, said in part:
"it is no secret that thousands of 11
legal voles were cast on November
7th. and unless something is done to
ported the electorate. Republican
form of governmt nt must be a failure.
If legal voters In this state cannot go
to the polls on election day and cast
their votes and have llient counted
as cast, and Illegal voters cannot be
prevented from participating In our
election; and if persons can vote as '
often as directed to do so by political j
bosses and machine politicians, then |
Indeed the time has conic when people i
must consider some other method of
ascertaining the will of the people as I
to who shall hold office and as to the'
form of government under which we
shall live.
"Under our present law we have no '
way In which to investigate and tie- !
vclop the facts necessary to inform i
law officers as to what can he done
iitid ought to be done, and in my judgment
the only way to have a fair and
full investigation is by and through a
committee to be appointed by author-1
Ity of the legislature and given power
to sit at different places in the state!
and to employ such assistants as may
he necessary to make the investigation |
full and complete. Without attempt-.
ing to reflect upon any officer. I call :
your attention to the fact that in many
Instances those charged with the duty
Df enforcing the law are beneficiaries:
t;f Illegal votes cnst it the recent eloc-;
tion, and it is too much to expect of'
them that they will prosecute their'
friends.
And even if these officers were inclined
to do their full duty, they are
not clothed with sufficient power and
authority to make such investigation
its the subject warrants. And let mo
also remind you that every good citizen
of the slate of West Virginia is
interested not only in the election in
his precinct and his county, but is also
vitally interested in having a fair
election in each and every precinct of
the state. If there be corruption in .
