"It has been found," said Mr. Thorn,
"that thoV. wealth of the country has
been increasing at the rate of $ oi ;i
tier rent a yen r, and the same ratio of
increase Ins held good as to the de
mand for transportation. As the forces
which have effected the growth and de

continue in full operation- and may r.

investment in railroad facilities to
