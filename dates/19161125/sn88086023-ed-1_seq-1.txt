A BILLION TO AID
WAR SUFFERERS

State Should Raise the Sum
and Make Friends.
PHILADELPHIA. Nov. 25. A plea
for a billion dollar fund to aid suf
ferers of all the warring nations was
made by Myron T. Herrick. ex-Ambassador
to' France, before an audi
ence of ;00 whose wealth runs Into
the millions. He spoke at a dinner
given by Mrs. E. T. Stotesbury, and
his Idea was applauded vigorously.
Mr. Herrick suggested that th;
t'nited States government directly
launch the programme and that the
Immense fund be spent by a single
committee of the leading men of the
country in all kinds of relief work.
State and federal governments might
give appropriations.
"It is often said that the Vnited
States will have no friends when this
war ends," said Mr. Herrick, "but
were we to create this gigantic char
ity its beneflclent work would far
overshadow all the animosities which
now vex us. We should have all these
nations as our friends."

ambition out of the insects, it did.
s.nd he started to remove the sheet of
iron.
It was heavy and he had hardly
moved it an inch when a stream ot
honey began to pour down Into the
fireplace. Pails, pans, and finally a
wash boiler were used to hold the
honey.
But when It was tasted It had a
peculiar flavor and odor.
"Why, It's like chloroform lint,
