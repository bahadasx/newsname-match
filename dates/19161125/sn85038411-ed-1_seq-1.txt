—The football elevens of Yale ar.ii
Harvard universities met here this
afternoon in their annual game be
fore the largest gathering of specta
tors that evir witnessed a gridiron ■
contest in this countiy. Close to su,-
UOO spectators tilled every seat of the j
twenty-nine miles oi tiers which form
the Vale tootball pavilion. Additional j
rows of frame seats surmounted the
parapet and when the captains tosseu j
a coin for goals there was not a vacant j
foot of space to be seen in the vast J"
amphitheater.
The weather was cold and from a
heavily gray clouded sky the wind :
blew a gaie out of the north sweep

and making punting and catching of,
the bull both uncertain and difficult.
The turf due to the heavy rain o;
Thursday, was soft and slow with
Fiipperv and muddy spots near thv
center of the gridiron.

The gathering of spectators pre-'

scene of color. Heavy fur coats lent 1
a somber background to the brilliantly
hued short jackets anu throw-overs of t
the women in attendance.
The chilling wind penetrated every
portion of the bowl, and the football]
enthusiasts sat huddled in serried
rows bundled up like Eskimos.

Christmas Holiday Will
Be Observed by Schools
If any school "kiddies" have been
'retting over the fact that there might
!>e no Christmas vacation because of
( the belated opening of school, their
! hearts have been set at rest by a re
cent decision of the School Board. All
I the regular school holidays will be ob
served up until March 16.
The first month of school was lost
I through the mandate of the State
Health authorities who prohibited the
opening of the schools throughout the
State because of the infantile paralv
sis epidemic. Which no final conclu-
I sion has been reached in this citv as
'o what will be done, it is the belief
'.hat if the work can be made up dur
j ing the shortened term it may not be
necessary to prolong the school term.
Reports for the first month at some of
the buildings show that better work
than ever Is being done and that the
I pupils are responding to the request
I for more diligent work.

COASTWISE SHIP
CATCHES FIRE
Crew of Powhatan, of Mer
chants and Miners Line, Get
Flames Under Control
Boston, Nov. 25. The steamer
Powhatan of the Merchants and Min
;ers Line which left Boston last night
for Baltimore with sixteen passengers
and a general cargo, caught firt- early
to-day off Block Island. She im
mediately sent out a call for help but
before coast guard cutters had reach
|ed the scene Captain Chase had re
ported the fire which was in the for
ward hold, , was under control and
that the vessel had anchored in Block
I Island harbor.
! The extent of the damage was not
learned at the company's offices here
•although it was stat'-d that the Pow
. hatan would continue her voyage af -
■ ter an examination of her machinery.
After a more cari.'ul examination
j of the vessel, which had a heavy list
to port Captain Chase reported that
I the Powhatan would proceed to Prov-
I ider.ee to land her passengers. Th
list was due, It was said, to the shift
ing of the cargo in the forward hold
and to the flood of water which was
pumped into her to extinguish the
fire. Later estimates indicated con
siderable damage* to the cargo.

Believes Government Should
Have Control; Wants Fed

ashington. Nov. 25.—Some of the
principles which the ralroads believe
; should be included in any just system
!of regulation were outlined to-day by
the joint congressional investigating
committee by A. P. Thorn, counsel for
the railway executives advisory com
mittee. The main features were:
The entire power and duty of regu
lation should be in the hands of the
national government except as to mat
ters so essentially local and incidental
that cannot be used to interfere
with the efficiency of the service or
the just rights of the carriers.
As a means to acccomplish this end.
a system of federal incorporation should
be provided for to cover all railroad
corporations engraved in inter-State and
foreign commerce.

Reorganization of the Interstate
Commerce Commission and creation of
a new federal railroad commission and

How to be given the Interstate Com

HIS ATTACK ON

Bandits Start Battle at Day

ENCAMPED NEAR CITY
Held Forces on Plains Around
Capital All Night; Losing
Heavily
Juarez, Mex., Nov. 25. The
Villa bandits again were repulsed
early to-day by the Carranza
forces defending Chihuahua City,
according to a message received at
military headquarters here. The
message said the repulse was even
more decisive than those of yes
terday and Thursday, the bandits
being driven clear of the suburbs
after desperate efforts to pene
trate to the heart of the city and
take it by storm.
Juarez, Mex., Nov. 25.—Fran
cisco Villa and his bandit forces
resumed the attack on Chihuahua
City at daybreak to-day accord
ing to dispatches from the Chi
huahua capital to Carranza of
ficials here, marking the opening
of the third day's fighting in Vil
la's efiort to wrest the capital
from eneral Jacinto 11. Trcvino's
Constitutionalist forces.
Juarez, Mex., Nov. 25.—Repulsed in
repeated attacks upon Chihuahua City
during the last two days, troops of
Krancisco Villa are still encamped
near the city to-day, according to
Mexican government officials here.
The bandit army lost heavily in the
attacks made on Thursday and Fri
day, Carranza declared, adding that
the government troops had remained
loyal.
Villa's latest attack upon Chihuahua ■
City continued until 9 o'clock last
night, the officials said. General!
Ozuna, commanding government
forces, late yesterday was said to have
pursued a bandit column for some
distance outside the city. In the
meantime another body of Villa fol
lowers appeared from another quar
ter and attacked. Later, it was stated,
Ozuna returned to the city with his
command. There was nothing to in
dicate that the lighting was on a large
scale.
Repeatedly Stormed Hills
High hills are located immediately
east, west and south of Chihuahua
City. Santa Kosa hill has been forti
fied and the repeated efforts of the
bandits to take this stronghold are
said to have been unsuccessful. North
of the city an open plain stretches
for several miles and it was from this
quarters that Villa made his raid on
Septemher 16. The possibility exists,
Carranza officials said, that Villa
might invade Chihuahua City from
the north, but they maintained that
it would be impossible for him to
hold the town against General
Trcvino's artillery mounted on Santa
Hosa hill.
State Commerce Chamber

Preliminary plans have been made
for the organization of a State Cham

Chamber of Commerce, and signed by
Howard 13. French, president, and N.
B. Kelly, general secretary, of that
organization.
Invitations have been sent to Cham
bers of Commerce in the State to send
representatives to a meeting to be held
in this city Wednesday afternoon. De
[ cember 6, at 2.30 o'clock. (ine of the
plans of the organization v.hen com
pleted, will be to bring the men in
civic, industrial and agricultural life
in closer touch with the legislators of
the State, in order to bring about the
passage of constructive legislation to
meet emergencies arising in modern
business. y
The organization will probably be
modeled after the Chamber of <"oni
nurcc of the United States, and will
have headquarters in this city.
Local Man Is Cousin
of Captain Koenig
of Deutschland Fame
A man who speaks of the wortd
famous and hero-worshiped comman
der as the Deutschland as "My cousin
Paul" was discovered this morning in
the person of William Koenig, 1331
Cowden street.
As a boy William Koenig did not
like the idea of military life, but with
Paul Koenig, his cousin and playmate,
it was different. Together they sailed
on a creek near their home. Always
Paul said: "Some day I will be a
sailor and serve our Kaiser on the ships
that sail the big seas."
Especially was Paul interested In the
stories his elders told about ships that
would some day sail not on the seas,
but down beneath the surface where
no man could see their passage. The
story tellers did not exactly believe
the stories they told, but the eager
little listener did. \
At high school Paud was noted for
his unusual mental ability. Mathema
tics and his hobby, tales of the sea his
delight, and the Kaiser his worshiped
god.
Twenty-five years ago William left
the fatherland for America, but letters
have kept them constantly in touch
with one another.
