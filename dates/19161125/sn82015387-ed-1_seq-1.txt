Delightful Affair.
CONNOISSEURS DEFIN
ED, BUT YET MYSTERY
Toastmaster Piguet Draws
Out Expressions of Learn
ing and Good Will.
'When we speak'of connoisseurs we
are apt to be reminded of art sad
sculpture, but there ie another lind
of art that perhaps appeals to the
eaverage 4ndividual with greater
-force than all the other arts com
bined. This is the art of cooking.
"The ouinary profleiency that mal
the humna heart mellow and satia
fled and receptive to all the 'infu
ences of good comradeshlp and that
aids the sipped wine in inducing the
tongue to say the clever. things the
mind invents in the fullness of the
soul, and eauses the outfdowing of
felicitations that make mortals feel
like one big family-a pedigreed
family with a taint of the feasts of
Trlrmalchio and the teachings of
Epicurnes.
Well, anyhow the Connoisseurs
gave a banquet at Tony Gabriel's last
Saturday evening and Gabe caught
the spirit of the whole thing and did
himself proud by serving the best
prepared dinner that his ever made
a gathering happy tin Covinton, and.
after the wine glasses bad been ~l-led
and refiled and Toastmaster Pf.ruet
had ethausted his resourie a in ,bring
eng out expressions of good will and
learning and happy repartee, Gabe
gave an exhibition of his a0b'ity as
a 'warbler and earned the 'hearty ap
plause of al 'Hs aesistant, Jim
l.ussan, sang some excellent rag-time
soag. a ia cabaret, there weeas a Vic
trola concert of high clas recorde
through the ýoutesy of ,Mr. Rauseoh
together with piano performances -by
Prof. Alexander that were very en
joyable.
The banquet as a most delightful
affair and the ester-dinner talks
brougtht whdiesome food for thought.
The banquet of the Connoi.seeuo was
an affair atrtbatable to the generous
kindneme of J. P. Rauech and E. j.
Domergue. We have spoken of ron
noisseurs of art and copnolseure of
cookery, but we have said nothing
of conndosseurs of eeetions. 'In -fact,
we haven't thought this neceary,
because the public wduldn't under
stand; but for the benefit of these
present we can not refrain from the
remark that there is esuch a thiig
connoisseurs of elections and that
future banquets of the Connoisseurse
will surely bring to mind that there
is also each a thing as connoisseurs
of reoiprocity.

TELLS OF HER
CANNING
CLUB
How She Did the Work that
Won the Prize add -Enti
tled Her Story to Pub
lication in Farmer.
I joined the Canning Club so I
eould learn to grow and can vege
tables in the home.
My garden was 66x66 teat, it
therefore contained 446 square
feet. The .location was a well drain
ed sandy loam soil, with a clay sub
soil. I selected this kind of soil be
cause a soil that is not wel dr'ined
is stiff anll wet, and will not grow a
good crop. Plants that are in a well
drained soil will resist doutil better
than one that is not properly drain
ed. A soil with a clay subsoil will
also help the plant in dry weather
by tholding moisture.
I had Ly plot plowed in February
att-a turn plow. After having it
,Wi ;broken up I app ail the fer.ii
iser by scattering one ton of barn
, *tt anure br over the plot.
'~ scatteri $ fertilizer over
-the groudd I XIedt . wit, the roil
ty running a dsk. harroi both ways
over the plot. "I practicea level cut
tiva.tion, as peaked ridges dry out
top quickly.
I did not have any deep plowing
.fter setting the plants. I used only
SDiamond shovel and side harrows
to keep a dry mulch ¢n the surface.
I planted my seed 1i open ground
on February 19th and 22. I trans
planted them on April 7th .:nd bth,
settrig them in the rows S t-2;,: feet.
I pruned the bushes leaving from
three to five stems to eaan. I used
stakes for supports, putting up from
two to three-stakes to eah.
The only insect that attacke: my.
garden. was a large green, worm,
rwhich I killed by band. The only
disease that attacked thenm was the
"tomato wilt." I gathered all the
plants affected and burned them, be
lag very careful not to scatter any
of the soil on their roots, and also
not to handle any of the other bush
es. I lest about ten .plauth with the
wilt. I did not grow any other
,vegetable on my plot but tomaitoes,
as I was a firet year gir!.
I did my own canning at hcme
on our home canner. I used No. 2
ueas for containers. I did not at
tend but one club- meetiru, .which
wae held In Covington July 25th and
'2th. We had a anice time while
there, and also heard Nome very in
struetf leetures given cby agents
a-. oar 'arm Demonstrator, and
othere.
While In the club I h.ve learneed
several things about how to grow to
batoes and dlfferent ways to ce-ok
ed uv thm.s It a bae s v*y

. wW .
interesting piece of work -for me as
I enjoy going into the garden and
hoeing and pruning the t'matnes
since a very small gir!. And when I
had a tenth of an acre of Just my own
to work and can the tomatoes I felt
very proud to see them growing,
knowing they were my own. I have
used several recipes for tomatoes;
among them were recipes for green
tomato pickles., tomato puree and to
mato catsup, and tomato paste.:
I gathered 1,732 pounds of tome.
toes from my pot. Used 78 pounds
in the 'home. Sold 278 pounds fresh,
and canned 00 No. 2-cans tomatetm,
40 cans t to puree, 7 jars green
tomato pickes, 19 bottles tomato
catsup, and 1 jar tomatoes. My ex
pensee were $23.33. The estimated
value of.produ s were 464.31. ' My
net profit was $40.97.-.
The club work has .helped me in
several different ways. It has help
ed me in learning to grow tWiatow
how and when to prune and stae,
how to can them in Iifferent ways.
It . has helped me in a finaeilal
way.
