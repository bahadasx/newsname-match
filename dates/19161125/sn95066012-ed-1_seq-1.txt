TEUTONIC -igERS
THREATEN
Armies Advancing on Fumanian
Capital from Three Direciions
CONTROL WESTERN WALLACHIA
German Attempts to Cross Danube
Spiritedly Resisted by Russians
and Rumanians.
London, Nov. 25. The forces of the
central powers seemingly are endeav
oring to drive on Bucharest, the Ru
manian capital, from three direc
tions. To the west the troops of Gen
von Falkenhayn have reached the Alt
river; to the north, the Germans and
Austro-Hungarlans are pressing south
ward from the Predeal and Torzburger
posses, and somewhere along the
Danube, either to the south or
southeast the forces of Field Marshal
von Mackensen are crossing the
river.
Western Wallachla apparently; Is
entirely In the hands of the Teutonic
allies, as both Berlin and Vienna re
port that the line of the Alt has been
reached. Some Rumanians remain in
the rear around Orsova, but that town
as well as Turnu-Severin, has been oc
cupied by the Teutonic troops, and the
Rumanians doubtless have fled Into
the mountains northward. The pres
sure of the German and Austro-Hun-garlan
troops continues north and
northwest of Bucharest.
Violent flehting has again broken
out in Dobrudja. While attempting
to hold the Russians and Rumanians
In check north of the Tchernavoda
Constanza railway line. Field Marshal
;Von Mackensen, Berlin records, has
.thrown his men across the Danube at
several places, but just where is not
stated. Bucharest says that an at
tempt by the Germans to cross the
Danube at Zlmmnitzas, 70 miles south
west of Bucharest, failed. Fighting
has been reported in the region of 1
Silistrla, on the Danube, southeast of
the Rumanian capital, during the past
few days, and It may be that the Ger
man crossings of the river were made
between Tcbernavoda and Giurgevo. )
The Russians and Rumanians have .
taken the offensive successfully in
Dobrudja, north of the Tchernavoda-!
Constanzt railway, Bucharest and Pet-;
rograd assert. The Rumanians ad
vanced on the whole front, especially
In the center and on the left wing, and
occupied five towns about 15 miles
north of the railway. Berlin declares
the Russian offensive in Dobrudja was
thrown back.
In Macedonia the entente offensive
continues to progress. Servian troops
have occupied Rapesh, east of Monas-1
tir. North of Suhodol the Servians
put a German force to fight. Berlin
says there has been renewed ar
tillery firing along the front In Mace
donia, and Sofia claims the repulse of
attacks east of Paralovo and between
Lakes Presba and Ochrlda.
There has been no Infantry activity
on the front in France on a large scale
but the artillery bombardments by
both sides north and south of the
Somme have Increased in intensity. !
Berlin reports the repulse of several 1
small British attacks, and London de
clares a German attempt south of
Puisleux was frustrated.

BUCHAREST
i CHURCH BUT MEANS
TO AN END. SAYS
SUNDAY
No Organization Successful Un
less Souls Are Saved
URGES ALL TO ACCEPT CHRIST
Evangelist Evidently Pleased With
Large Number of Converts
in Boston
Boston, Nov. 24. BHly - Sunday
preached to a large audience at both
the afternoon and evening meetings
today. At his second request for trail
hitters after tonight's service just 470
people went down front to join the
ranks of converts. "The hour has
come" was the subject of the evening
sermon, and the baseball evangelist
was enthusiastic from the start
At the afternoon service the sub
ject of the sermon was "How devils
are cast out." According to the ath
letic evangelist no church is success
ful no auatter how many people it at
tracts, unless souls are saved.
At both services Billy Sunday
showed plainly the pleasure he ex
perienced over last night's record of
trail-hitters. At this evening's serv
ice lie urged all to lose no time Jn
accepting Christ. "Some people," he
said, 'think that to join a church is
the end, the joining is all that is nec
essary. The church is not the end. It
is the means to an end, and the soon
er you people find it out the better off
you will be."
Mr. Sunday said in part:
"The hour Is come. 1 am not wor
shipping a dead Jew sleeping In the
tomb of Arimathea, but a living
Christ. Boston is in the midst or the
greatest moral and religious crisis it
ever faced right now. The hour is
come to realize that the church is not
the end, that salvation does not rest
with those who occupy 17 square
Inches of space in the church every
Sunday and think they have done,
their full duty.
, "The gospel of Jobus Christ rightly
preached, interferes with all illicit
pleasures and rottenness in society. I
know there are some society women
who won't come to hear me; they are
too busy attending their poodle dogs
and bridge parties.
"The hour is come to believe in re
vivals. They say I am too sensa
tional. Sensation is life and stagna
tion is damnation. When you strike
at revivals you spit in the face of
Christ.
"I am not worshiping a dead jew
In the tomb of Arimathea, but a liv
ing, reigning Christ, who sits at the
right hand of God, from whence he
will come to judge the living and the
dead. The hour is come.
"The cross of Christ was the con
necting link between the Old and the
New Testament. The old Jewish cere
monial law ended at the cross, and
the gospel of dispensation through
faith in Christ followed the cross.
Jesus realized that he had reached a
crisis in his life. I believe the same
Is true In Boston right now.
"The hour Is come to realize that
the church is not the end. The
church is the means to an end. The
end is the salvation of man. If you
think that when you come Into the
church that Is the end, God have mer
cy on you and the church If you are
in it.
"The hour has come for something
else for plainness of speech by the
preachers. Specify sins, don't deal in
generalities. You admire a man who
preaches the truth at you, even
though he shoots holes into you. You
can always count on a decent public
to right a wrong and any public that
won't right a wrong is a good one to
get away from.
"I repeat that anybody who Is de
cent or wants to be decent, will ad
mire you when you preach the truth,
although you riddle them when you
are doing it. The hour is come, my
friends. The house has come to . be
lieve in revivals. Some people do not
want revivals; neither does the devil;
so you are like your daddy. I am In
favor of everything the , devil is
against, and I am against everything
the devil is in l'avor of: the dance, the
booze, the brewery, my friends that
have cards In their homos.
The hour has come to present our
selves to God to make ourselves right
with him.
"The hour has eomfT to go out after
the lost and bring them to God. Christ
says to the church of God in Boston.
'They are lost. Go ye out after them."
But you are indolent. You' are not
willing to do something to bring them
to Jesus. The hour has come."

DUMA WINS IN RUSSIA
Appointment of Trepoff as Minister Is
Victory for the People.
Petrograd. Nov. 24. Alexander
Trepoff, Minister of Ways and Com
munications, has been appointed Pre
mier to succeed M. Stunner, who by
an Imperial ukase has been appointed
Grand Chamberlain of the Imperial
Court, retaining his functions as a
member of the Codncil of the Empire.
The Council of the Empire has been
adjourned by Imperial ukase until
Doc. 2.
The resignation of M. Sturmer as
Premier and Foreign Minister hao.
long been accepted as an inevitable
outcome of the struggle between the
Dresent Cabinet and the Duma. It
caused no more than mild surprise,
and tills was due less to the event It-
self than the rapidity with which, the
situation matured since the definite
break between the Duma and the Gov
ernment.
It is almost impossible to overesti
mate not only the political but the
national significance of the Duma vic
tory, since for the firsi time in history
Russian public opinion Is considered
to have triumphed over ' influences
which were regarded as antagonistic
to good government.
M. Thepoff's appointment to the
post of Prime Minister is greeted with
satisfaction by the newspapers, which
however, express the opinion that this
is only the first step taken toward
carrying out the program which is
dictated by present political necessi
ties. According to the Retch, the
resignation of M. Sturmer is the first
occasion in the course of Russia's con
stitutional history which clearly es
tablishes between the Government
and the majority the voice of the Du
ma. "The Duma." says the Reth. "has
accomplished its first object, but It
does not necessarily follow that the
rest of the program will be executed.
The changes in the cabinet desired by
the majority in the Duma have not
been fully carried out. Only the
chief figure has been put aside. Fur
ther changes must follow, the most
important of which is the dismissal of
the Minister of the. Interior, and the
appointment of a proper person as For
elgn Minister."

RIGHT RETAINED
TO SEND TROOPS
American fxpedition in Mexico
Will Be Withdrawn
AGREEMENT ON PROTOCOL
Carranza Government Must First Im
proce Conditions In Northern
' Mexico.
Atlantic City, Nov. 25. A protocol
providing for the conditional with
drawal of the American troops ;now
In Chlhauhua. Mex., and for the mill
tary control of the border, but with
the supplemental stipulation that
United States troops shall be sent In
to Mexico in pursuit of bandits at any
time the American government deems
it necessary, was signed yesterday by
the members of the Mexican-American
Joint commission. One of the of
ficial copies was taken by Alberto J.
Pan! of the Mexican commission, who
left there lust night for New York,
whence he will start Monday for
Quereataro, where he will submit It to
Gen Venustiana Curranza for his ap
proval. The other copy will be de
livered to the American government
by Secretary of the Interior Franklin
K. Lane, chairman of the American
commission, who left Atlantic City
yesterday for Washington.
If the protocol is ratified by the
two governments the commission will
convene again on December 8 to re
sume the discussion of other questions
affecting the two countries, especial
ly those related to the protection of
the life and property of Americans
and other foreigners in Mexico. If
ratification by either government is
withheld the work of the conference
will be declared at an end.
Where the adjourned sessions of
the commission will be held was not
determined when the conference was
finished. That question was left to
Secretary of State Lansing .and Em
bassador Designate Arredondo. hol
lowing is a paraphrase of the agree
ment to which the last signature was
affixed at 3.49 o'clock yesterday aft
ernoon :
First, The American troops now in
Chihauhau. commanded by Gen. John
J. Pershing, shall be withdrawn within
40 days from the approval of the pro
tocol by the . respective governments,
provided that within that time the con
ditions In that part of Mexico have not
become such as to endanger the Ameri
can border. In such even the time
shall bo extended.
Second. The Mexican army shall
patrol the Mexican side of the border
and the American army the American
side, but this shall riot preclude co
operation between the two forces to
preserve peace upon tho border.
Third. It shall be left to the com
manding officers of the armies on the
border of both nations to enter into
such arrangements for co-operation in
operations against bandits whenever
it is possible.
The right of the American govern
ment to send troops across the border
in pursuit of bandits was no incor
porated in the protocol but was made
tho subject of a supplemental memo
randum. The Mexicans had contend
ed earnestly against signing any
agreement in which they appeared to
sanction what they termed the viola
tion oi' their national territory. It
was the agreement cf the Americans
finally to content themselves with
stating the attitude) of the United
States in a separate memorandum
that induced the Mexicans to sign tho
agreement.
The clause providing for the with
drawal of Gen Pershing's force states
that should the bandits in Chihuahua
appear near the border in such force
as to prove a hienace, the American
troops, acting independently or in
conjunction with the Mexican forces,
may disperse them. In such case, the
time for their withdrawal shall be ex
tended to such time as made neces
sary by the developments.

HEAVY LIFE INSURANCE
H. T. Dunn Has Polocies for Million
and Three-Quartert.
New York. Nov. 24. H. T. Dunn of
Toledo, a vice-president of the Willys
Overland company, and president of
the Fisk Rubber company, has taken
out life insurance for a little more
than $1,730,000. This became known
yesterday when the last of the policies
was issued and the big transaction be
came a topic of discussion among in
surance men.
Rodman Wanamaker, according to
report, carries more life insurance
than this amount; John Wanamaker
is supposed to carry as much, but Mr.
Dunn, nevertheless, isi one of the most
heavily insured men In the world.
When it was disclosed that Tom
Shevlin, the former Yale coach, had
been insured for $1,000,000 not long
before his death, the fact caused con
siderable comment, but Mr. Dunn la
Insured for almost twice this sum.
Part of the insurance is made out in
favor of the companies with which Mr.
Dunn is connected. The rest is In
come insurance for his wife and
daughter, paying them handsome an
nuities after his death.
The Toledo man is 41 years old, and
five physicians who examined him
pronounced him an excellent risk.
The policies were Issued by twelve
companies, the largest risk assumed
by one company being in the neighbor
hood of $250,000. It took four solid
days to put Mr. Dunn through the phy-
sicial examination and to attend to
the mass of detail Incident upon Is
suing tho many policies.

ANY EMBARGO ON
Fi
Insists Manufactured Products
Should be Restricted
REASONS ' FOR HIGH PRICES
Crops Were Short, Labor is Expensive
and the Farmer's Necessaries of
Life Cost More
Washington, Nov. 24. In defence of
the farmer the National Grange, In an
nual session here, issued a statement
tonight analyzing the high cost of liv
ing and attributing the rising prices
of farm products to poor crops and
the Increasing cost of what the farmer
has to buy.
If any embargoes are to be placed to
help the situation, the statement says
they should be on manufactured pro
ducts, particularly munitions of war.
Prohibition of gambling in foodstuffs
and provision of more storage houses
under control of the farmers them
selves also are suggested.
The statement says In part:
"The American farmer, with cheap
lands and high priced labor, produces
many times as much per man as does
the farmer of any country in the
world. The high price of farm pro
ducts is due to several causes. Some
of the most important ones are: The
climate conditions of this country dur-
tho past year were perhaps ono of the
leading causes of crop shortage, re
during the yield to a more marked
degree than has been the case for any
previous year. For example, the
wheat in the Northwest was a crop
failure. The corn crop was In many
sections a partial failure, as well as
the potato and vegetable crops.
".'t must be borne in mind ttiat the
high prices have struck the farmer in
whatever he buys, as much as it has
the city consumer. Farm labor Is
scarcer and hiKher than ever 4efore
In this country. Everything the
farmer buys, whether machinery, fer
tilizer, fencing, clothing or the neces
saries of life, have increased In price
by leaps and bounds.
"Our city cousins have changed
their method of living quite as much
as we have. Instead of buying in
quantities, as formerly, they live in
crajnped quarters with a kitchenette
6 by 8 and buy In very small quanti
ties, or live out of cartons and cans,
and many cases with little regard to
home economics.
"The fact that nearly one-half of
the civilized world has left the field
of production and entered upon the
work of destruction has increased the
demand for all kinds of products and
goods. We believe that prices will be
high for several years, especially for
manufactured good3.
"As to the products of the farm, the
fixing of prices is mainly by the law
of supply and demand in the markets
of the world. The farmer competes
with the cheapest paid labor on earth.
When he sells some of his products,
as ho did only a few years ago, at less
than ccst, he gets no redress, no re
duction in taxes nor in anything he j
L . . . ina it would do very unralr that
when he is getting a fair price for
some of his products to place an em
bargo on what he produces to lower
the price and ultimately reduce the !
supply. '
"We further believe that while the
crops have been short, yet there is
plenty for all in this country and some
to sell. But at the same time econo
my should be practised along all
lines.
"Gambling in food products should
bo prohibited.
"There should be more storage
houses in the country and under the
control of the farmers themselves.
"Tho American farmer is farming
as well as he can afford. He will in
crease the yields as he gets pay for ;
increased production. Increased pro- '
duction means increased cost and un-1
less prices warrant this increase the
farmer cannot go ahead."

ADAMSON LAW TEST
Attorney General Gregory Approves
Plans Now Uuder Way
Washington. Nov. 20. -Attorney-Ccn-
eral Gregory telegraphed the govern
ment lawyers In Kansas City last
night that he approved the plans for
expediting to the supremo court a
test case to determine the constitu
tionality of. tho Ada in son. act. agreed
tipon there by th government coun
sel and railroad lawyers. The case
to be used as a test Is that brought
by the Missouri, Oklahoma and Gulf
railroad. In which Judge Hook of the
federal court at Kansas City decided
against the government.
As understood in Washington, the
carriers coming into tho agreement
would keep such accounts as are nec
essary under the law to make pay
ments to the affected employes in
case the law Is held constitutional.
This requirement was incorporated in
Judge Hook's decision In the Mis
souri case. The agreement also would
provide that railroads should not file
new suits attacking the Adamsonlaw
pending the supreme court's decision,
and should not institute further ac
tions if the law be held valid. It
would not seek to prevent effort to
obtain legislation amending the d
nmson act, however.- :'
