0FU.E
(From Thursday's Dally Miner.)
Picking: into a missed hole in the
United Eastern shaft No. 2 at a depth
of 665 feet yesterday caused the death
of Abe Xiles and tfle yalnful injury
of his brother, Mike, and the slight
injury of J. H. White, James Chap
man and Ike Brown.
The men were mucking out after
a round of holes. Abe Liles was
picking up the bottom when his pick
struck some unexplored powder. The
rock, destroying the sight of his right
explosion that resulted terribly
mangled Abe Liles, causing instant
death, and filled Mike Liles face with
eye. The other men were more or less
injured by flying rock and debris. A
bucket that stood in the shaft saved
the other men from serious, if not
fatal, in jury. The accident occured
at 3:15 yesterday afternoon.
Abe Liles, who was killed by the
explosion, had worked in the mine
more than a year. He was 86 years
of age and leaves a wife and three
children. He was president of the
Miners' Union and the Central Labor
Union of Oatman.
The killing of Liles Is the first bad
accident that has occured in the
United Eastern mine since its ex
ploration was begun.
INJURED MEN ARE
10 COAST
EYE SPECIALISTS
In SHAFT I
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
Mike Liles and J. R. Brown, who
were badly injured Wednesday after
noon at the United Eastern No. 2
shaft when Abe Liles, brother of the
former, picked into a missed hole and
was instantly killed, were sent to Los
Angeles yesterday afternoon for
special treatment by eye specialists.
Mike Liles was the worst injured
but he is getting along as good as
could be expected andwill recover,
unless some complications set in. His
light eye was badly cut in several
places by the flying rocks and Dr.
Mapes is afraid that the sight will be
lost However, it is thought that by
special care by eye specialists the
sight may be saved. A small rock
still remains in the lower part of the
pupil and if it is possible to remove
it without further injury to the eye
the sight will be saved.
After being treated by Dr. Mapes
soon after the accident Brown was
able to leave the hospital but later
returned on account of the intense
pain in his right eye which was badly
injured. He remained in the hospital
( over night and after further exam
ination it was thought advisable to
send him to a Los Angeles eye special
fat James Chapman who was also hurt,
was able to leave the hospital after
Ids wounds were dressed. He was cut
in several places about the head and
face and his eyes were filled with
rocks and dirt but they were not bad
ly injured.
W. H. White, the fifth miner in the
shaft at the time of the explosion
was not injured. A bucket was be
tween him and the explosion and
saved him from injury.
Mike Liles, besides the injury to his
eye, was badly cut about the face and
head. His chest was also cut in sev
eral places, but other than being ex
tremly painful it is thought that his
injuries are not necessarily dangerous.
The body of Abe Liles w,ill be buried
in Kingman Sunday afternoon. A
large number of friends of the de
ceased, members of the Miners'
Union, of which Liles was president,
" will attend. Rev. Norcross of Oat
man will officiate. Two brothers and
a. sister of Mr. Liles and a brother of
Mrs. Liles are expected to arrive this
afternoon or tomorrow. Harry Parr,
George Shortley, Len Strumm, Jack
Mclver, Frank Wyland and "Baldy"
t Mason will be the pall bearers.
(From Tharsday'a Dally Miner
Frank Imus wife and son were
among the circus visitors yesterday,
coming in from their ranch east of
here.
WHITE CHIEF WILL
E
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner.)
That the Arizona White Chief has
been fully financed and will resume
operations at once was the announce
ment made by a party of mining men
and bankers who left Oatman yester
day afternoon for the coast. The men
who have taken over the financing and
management of the White Chief are
W. P. Wagg of Los Angeles and H. H.
Cogle and E. K. Buckley of Fullerton,
CaL,
They spent several days in Oatman
and during that time thoroughly ex
amined the property. So much con
fidence have they in it that they have
fully financed it and work will begin
at once.
The property has been closed down
for several months for the lack of
capital. The shaft is down 200 feet
It is proposed to continue it to the
600 foot point as fast as men and
machinery can do it
CAMP PROSPECTED
, FORTY YEARS AGO
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
That the Oatman-Goldroad district
was prospected 40 years ago has been
proven by a location notice found
recently by N. E. Nichols near the
side lines of the old Hardy mine. A
location monument, location notice and
a blue print map of the claim were
found by Mr. Nichols while prospect
ing.
The location monument was built
high with rocks, cemented together
with adobe. The map and location
notice were incased in a moose hide
pouch and placed inside the monument
where the rain could not damage
them. The moose hide pouch and the
papers were but little injured by their
40-year stay in the monument The
location was made in March, 1876, and
recorded the same year at Washing
ton, D. C.
The location was made by a member
of the United States Cavalry which
was stationed at Fort Mohave at that
time. The location notice was witnes
sed by the ranking officer and two
other officers. The names and rank
of these officers and the name of the
locator are not obtainable at this time
owing to the fact that Mr. Nichols
sent the papers to his home in Spring
field, Illinois, soon after he found it
CHARLES HUGHES
SENDS PRESIDENT
CONGRATULATIONS
LAKEWOOD, N. J., Nov. 22.
Charles E. Hughes, Republican
candidate for president in the re
cent election, tonight sent " to
President Wilson a telegram con
gratulating him upon his reelec
tion. In his telegram Mr. Hughes
said:
"Because of the closeness of the
vote I have waited the official
count in California and now that
it has been virtually completed,
permit me to extend to you my
congratulations upon your reelec
tion. I desire also to express my
best wishes for a successful ad
ministration." TWO MEN HAVE NARROW
ESCAPE FROM INJURY
(From Tharsday'a Dally Miner.)
E. J. Hoover, who has considerable
property in the Mineral Park sectian,
had a narrow escape from being killed
i while in the local express office yes-
jterday. Someone in the office placed
a cartridge in the stove with some
papers. Shortly the fire ignited the
'papers and the cartridge exploded,
the bullet grazing the skin of Hoover's
left eye. It then struck the wall,
glanced and struck Guy Mensch on the
, leg. Fortunately force had been spent
and no harm resulted.
1 GOES TO JEROME
i (From Tharsday'a Dally Miner.)
' H. M. Crowther departed yesterday
morning for Jerome, where he will con
fer with J. E. Leeper on matter ap
pertaining to the Arizona Butte mines,
of vhich he is the general manager.
Mr. Crowthrr has been making a big
success of mining and milling at the
property on Stockton Hill, the1 mill
shipments giving better results as the
mill is tuned up.
LEVIATHAN MILL
BEING TRIED OUT
From Friday'a Dally Miner
A telephone message from Supt
Strieker to John H. Conway yester
day, conveyed the information that
the big engines of the Leviathan mill
were tried out and worked success
fully. The mill will be turned over
today and a trial run will be made
at once. The mill is designed to
handle the molybdenum-copper pro
duct of the mine, there being about
a million dollars worth of this class
of ore in sight
While the mine has only been de
veloped to the 100-foot level below an
adit drift it has revealed some of
the most wonderful ore bodies in the
county. The drift on the 100-foot
level has been carried on the vein
about 400 feet, all in ore. Wherever
a crosscut has been run the ore body
has been found to be from 15 to 20
feet wide, and all milling grade. A
raise from the 100-foot level to the
adit level passed .through splendid ore,
although the roof of the drift was
practically barren at the point of
which the raise was started. One
round of holes broke through the bar
ren ground and to the level above
splendid ore was found. The com
pany also has other veins that give
nearly as great promise on the surface
as the Leviathan. These will be cut
on the 500-foot level, when that depth
is reached.
(From Tharsday'a Dally Miner.)
The Cole Brothers circus, which
gave ' performances here yesterday
afternoon and evening, has as its ad
vertising manager, H. P. Kutz, who is
not desirious of a second experience
such as he had some months ago. The
circus was showing in Sault Saint
Marie, Michigan, when he had occasion
to visit the Canadian side of the inter
national line. He took passage on a
ferry and, when descending the gang
plank, was stopped by a Canadian'
officer and taken into a detention office
for examination. He was held there
three hours, given the third degree
and grilled thoroughly before the
Canadian authorities could be made to
believe that he was an American citi
zen and not a German spy.
Mr. Kutz is a Pennsylvania Dutch
man and speaks with a decided accent,
which aroused the suspicion of the
Canadian officers. Although he had
many friends even in the Canadian
city he was unable to get in communi
cation with them to get their help
until the officers had made a full ex
amination. Mr. Kutz has had varied experiences
in his newspaper and circus work. He
was at one time editor of one of the
foremost German papers of the United
States. Mr. Kutz says that notwith
standing the fact that he had been
about the world for many years he
believes his Canadian experience
stands forth as the one odd incident
of his existence.
ROY HAMBLIN KILLED
IN PAYROLL MINE
(From Chloride Section Dally Miner)
The family and many friends of
Roy Hamlin were plunged into deep
sorrow Wednesday afternoon when
they learned that the young man had
suffered accidental death in a drift in
the Payroll mine. He was on the morn
ing shift and his body, partially cov
ered with rock, was discovered when
the men went to work in the mine at
3 o'clock. The accident occurred on
the 400-foot level and the rock which
caused his death is believed to have
been precipitated on him as the result
of a slide. Young Hamlin was em
ployed as a miner,
j He was 21 years old and one of the
jbest known and liked of the yonuger
set in the camp. He is survived by
his father, mother and a sister, who
I recently resigned as clerk in the local
jpostoffice. The funeral arrangements
! will be announced later.
ZINC PROPERTIES
(From Friday'a Dally Mlner.)
During the last two days, A. M.
Matthews, in company with Rev.
Fathers B. F. Serafinas, M. Kruszas
and Alex Ambrazunas, all of Chicago,
have been making an examination of
the properties of the Kingman Zinc
company, situated on Stockton Hill.
R. S. Billings, a well know mining
engineer, accompanied the party for
the purpose of examination and re
porting on the mines.
Mr. Matthews has raised a large
sum of money in and around Chicago
for the purpose of developing the
company's properties and is here to
again put development under way.
The Kingman Zinc mines are com
posed of the Shooting Star and other
properties in and around it The
Shooting Star is one. of the best prop
erties in the district, the vein being
large, well defined and thoroughly
mineralized. The metals contained in
the ore are gold, silver, copper, lead
and zinc
The one peculiar thing about the
ores is the fact that the zinc and cop
per are contained in separate streaks
and can be kept clean in extraction.
Development has been carried on to
a depth of 200 feet and the ore body
maintains its width and value. Some
development done on adjoining ground
shows good values in gold and silver.
With proper development the property
is sure to be a winner.
AT THE
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
At the Oatman Combination drift
ing continues east and west on the
500-foot level. The east drift is now
200 feet in length. A large quartz
stringer has been followed in the drift
for some time. It is thought to be
an off-shoot from the main vein which
is believed to be near.
Pannings from the stringer show
free gold, and assays as high as $9
have been obtained from it It is
the opinion of the management that
within a very short time the vein
will be exposed. The west drift is
150 feet long.
SECURE PROPERTY IN
COPPER CAMP OF AJO
(From Friday'a Dally Miner
J. S. Amundsen returned Tuesday
last from Phoenix, where he and
Vincent Fortune secured a large
block of ground contiguous to the
property of the New Cornelia, one
of the biggest disseminated porphyry
properties in Ihe State. The work of
getting the development of the prop
erty under way will be begun within
a short time and carried forward ex
peditiously. A number of Kingman
gentlemen are interested in the deal.
U. E. MINE ACCIDENT
INQUEST IS DELAYED
(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
The inquest, which was scheduled
for yesterday morning to ascertain the
direct cause of the death of Abe Liles,
who was killed by an explosion in No.
2 shaft of the United Eastern mine
Wednesday afternoon, was yesterday
postponed by Coroner Sheffield pend
ing the arrival of the mine inspector.
Work in the shaft where the accident
occured has been suspended owing to
the fact that the law requires that the
mine inspector must view the place of
accident before work may proceed.
RETURNS FROM VISIT TO
' HIS HOME IN CALIFORNIA
James Meikle returned from a trip
to his home In Berkeley, California,
yesterday. He reports enjoying his
visit with his family even though he
found his eldest daughter seriously
ill. She had been confined to a hos
pital 'for .many weeks but is now im
proving rapidly.
The young lady will graduate short
ly from the Stanford University, hav
ing taken a post-graduate course in
law. She was an active officer of
several of the student bodies and it
is thought that this added work, to
gether with her studies brought on the
nervous breakdown she suffered.
PARTY OF CAPITALISTS

(From Oatman Section Dally Miner)
The largest assemblage of capital
ists ever brought together in one body
in Mohave county will make up the
Midway Mining and Milling company's

San Francisco, L03 Angeles and San
Diego. As a body, they will come
from Los Angeles.
Upon arrival here the party will be
taken to the property of the Midway
Mining and Milling company and later
to all points of interest in the district

n HOLD MEETING
(From Friday'a DaHy Miner.)
A meeting of the Country Club was
held last evening with a large num
ber of members present The mem
bership committee submitted the
names of several new members. The
ways and means committee presented
a feasible plan for the floating of the.
bonds for the erection of a clubhouse.
As an evidence of the interest of the
townspeople in the enterprise it may
be well to mention that the committee
found it possible to sell $4,000 worth
of bonds within a very short time.
Many important matters were acted
upon At the meeting and there is no
doubt that a working plan will be
adopted within the near future, after
which it will be but a short time
until ground will be broken for the
foundation of the proposed clubhouse
which will be a credit, as well as an
asset, to Kingman.
The members present unanimously
agreed to be upon the golf grounds
of the club Sunday morning to assist
in clearing and staking. The meeting
was one of the most enthusiastic thus
far held and it is to be hoped that the
ardor of the members will not dampen.
HOLDERS OF
ELECTION BETS
ARE PAYING UP
NEW YORK, Nov. 22 Holders
of some of the largest wagers
made in Wall street on the presi
dential election began paying the
bets off today on the assumption
lion that there now was no doubt
that President Wilson had been
reelected. Estimates of amounts
wagered range from $4,000,000 to
$5,000,000. It was said there still
remained a few who placed money
on Hughes who insist their bets
not be paid until President Wil
son's election is officially con
firmed. MOVES TO JEROME
E. A. Burns is reported to have dis
posed of his residence in Kingman
and his family is to remove to Jerome,
where he is promoting a mining prop
erty, the Michigan Verde. Mr. Burns
has been a hustler and his many
friends here wish him all kinds of
success in his undertakings.
BACK FROM BIG BEND
From Tharsday'a Dally Miner
Ray D. Harris returned yesterday
from a brief visit to the Big Bend
country, where he and associates have
large copper-bearing holdings, upon
which work is now in progress. He
was accompanied by George Smith.
From Tharsday'a Dally Miner
Clarence J. Wilson is again home
after a visit to the hills for several
days.
PAY DIVIDENDS
OF II
III 10
American mines to the number of
167 showed "wonderful earning pow
ers in 1916," distributing in the first
10 months a total of $184,830,127, says
the Mining and Engineering World.
"If the dividend payments of the securities-holding
corporations were to
be included (and a large proportion
could be rightfully included), the
year's total would reach $223,433,208,
a wonderful and convincing argument
that mining, as now carried on, is one
of the principal reasons for our pres
ent standing at the head of the world's
greatest industrial centers. These
companies paid dividends amounting
to $1,067,277,064, which with the divi
dends paid in 1916, makes a total of
$1,252,107,191. Thi3 is a return of
better than 133 per cent on the com
bined issued capital of the companies.
When it is considered that a large
number of these companies did not pay
a dividend previous to 1915 or 1916,
this is a remarkable record and one,
we believe, not duplicated by any oth
er industry. With 60 companies par
ticipating, dividends were paid to
shareholders during the month total
ing $16,663,385. This does not include
the $630,000 disbursed by the holding
companies. The copper companies
contributed $7,517,580 of this, the
gold-silver-lead-zinc companies $8,
154,447 and the rnetalurgical com
panies $991,358.
"Of the 167 companies participating
in the 1916 disbursements, 42 operate
copper properties," all butjwo in the
United States, and thesa-'divided
among shareholders $88,280,814. In
previous years these companies paid
dividends amounting to $571,530,726,
making their total to date $659,811,
540. This is a return on the com
bined issued capital of 186 per cent
One hundred and nineteen properties,
classified as gold-silver-lead-zinc pro
ducers, paid dividends during the 10
months of 1916 amounting to $77,149,
398. Addded to dividends paid in pre
vious years bring their total to $380,
088,724, on the combined issued capi
tal of $309,979,039, a return of prac
tically 124 per cent
"Of the 119 companies mentioned
above, 91 are operated in the United
States, and they have to their credit
in 1916 dividend payments of $64,530,
768. Added to the dividends paid
previously brings their total to $294,-
657,558, a return of approximately
150 per cent on the $197,644,778 out
standing."
TRAVEL INCREASING
ON LAS VEGAS ROUTE
A heavy travel has begun between
here and Las Vegas. Most of this travel
Salt Lake route. Most of this travel
is by incomers from Nevada, Utah and
eastern states. The roads are very
poor in places on the route, but much
time is saved by taking the short
cut The distance is 90 miles by
road while by railroad it is several
times this distance. The traveller is
usually governed by either expedience
or desire for comfortable travel In
deciding whether to come by auto via
Las Vegas, or by train via Kingman.
SPECIMEN RETURNED
President J. H. Conway of the
Leviathan Mining company yesterday
received from the State Fair commis
sion the large piece of molybdenum
ore which was exhibited by his com
pany and which was awarded a white
ribbon. Mr. Conway feels justly
proud of the specimen.
BUILDING STARTED
(From Friday'a Dal'y Miner.)
Contractor Lammers has started
work on the Lovin & Withers build
ing and has nearly completed already
several sheds necessary for storage of
materials. Within the next few days
active work will begin on the main
building proper and it will be pushed
to completion with all haste.
