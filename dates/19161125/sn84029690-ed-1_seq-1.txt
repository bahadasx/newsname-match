"The Fall of a Nation," which was
put on the screen at the New Opera
House, last Wednesday night, was or.e
of the most instructive, interesting and
entertaining pictures- ever presented to
the people of Hays. . A large audience
attended, both at" the matirree in the
afternoon and in the evening. It was
very realistic. It portrayed very vivid
ly what most surely would happen if
this country was ever conquered by a
j-foreign power. God forbid, that our
country is ever subjected to the horrors
portrayed on the screen last Wednes
day evening.
The . election Monday for Munici

The United States Government at Washington.

cial condition of a National Bank to protect de
positors. They are strict and we are, glad of it. We
stick strictly to Safe Banking business. Our strong
vaults will keep your money safe and your money

know how to properly entertain their
friends.
Monday, November 20th, was Aunty
Shaw's eighty-second birthday. In the
afternoon of that day, . she had her car
brought up and in company with a lady
friend, went down to cast her vote. It
was such a pleasant day that she wish
ed to make some calls, but was persuad
ed to return home as her friend intend
ed to spend the afternoon with her. In
a short time another friend dropped in,
and then Rev. Hale and wife. Soon
some twenty ladies came in upon her
to offer congratulations and wishes for
many more pleasant birthdays. Two
hours were spent very pleasantly by all.
Aunty ShaV remarked that this had
been one of the happiest daj's of her
life, and that few could realize" ho w
much it all had meant to one shut out
from the light of day she being blind,
for it helped to brighten the mind's eye
and bear the infirmities more cheerful
ly. -
. Perhaps the most b?:c conception of
a democracy is the public school. It is
here that a universal notion of national
patriotism is taught. It is here where
all local church prejudices are correct
ed. It is here where the children are
taught to respect each other regardless
of church, faj-nity, political party or
lodge ideas of each other. And it is
here where sectional horns, hoofs and
social s.nd church hates lose their power
to control. If the Methodist, Presby
terian, Lutheran tr Catholic church dtr
s'.re to keep up a priate schoo', it is
its right and p'easure to do so, but it is
misleading to tuink that it is double
taxation. If these churches want to
keep up shcools all of them do let us
cor.sidjr it as a church luxury and net
a j:-?cessity. If these denominations
want thi3 school luxury let them pro
vide for it, but not want the general
public to furnish or help to furnish the
local luxury. In other word3, if Jones
wants to ride in an automobile that is
h:s pieasure, but the general public
should not be taxed for it. If Jones
war.ts to ride differently thar- the gen
eral way. let him pay the price. If there
occasionally creeps into our schools
a.n instructor who teaches against God,
iekus protest. -
High Sc'icol Items.
The faculty and senior girls gave a
party at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Lee
for the Hays and Oberlin football toys,

Il jgh Douglas and Charles Wiggins,

of readings and piano solos rendered in

Mis Nickles gave an interesting ex
planation "of the slides showing scenes
in Hollar. J, a few da3s ago. The fact
that Miss Nckles has traveled in Hol
land, made her lecture doubly enter
taining. The Freshmen will put on the Thanks
giving program. They are making an
effort to make it one especially appro
priate to the season. " j
The progress on the new building was
delayed by the cold wave, but the walls

educational value to that for a whole
week in past years,'' said D. M. Bowen,
president of the association in 1905.

tent and the most distinguished in per
sonnel that the association has ever
