TOOK PART IX GREAT OFFEN
SIVE AGAINST ITALIANS IN
MAT—IS GREAT FAVORITE
WITH SOLDIERS.
London, Nov. 25.—What is to be
the fate of Austria-Hungary? How
will the new emperor wield the seep
ter of the ancient hous'e of Hapsburg?
These are the questions the diplo
mats in every court of Europe are:
asking each other the questions that!
are on every lip throughout the poly
glot dual monarchy as Karl Franz:
Josef, twenty-nine, begins his reign,
The young emperor alone holds the
answers. He is known as the friend
and associate of the common people
of his realm. But they know him,
too, as the friend, almost the pawn, of
Kaiser Wllhelm. They fear he will
lend too ready an ear to th.e masterly
counselors of Berlin.
And' the people fear. Their long
time apprehensions lest the Hohen
zollerns will swallow them up, grows
every hour.
The effect, if any, of Franz Josefs
death upon the war situation is a,
subject on which no opinion has been
expressed In official circles here be
cause, for one thing, very little is
known of the up-to-date situation in
the dual monarchy.
Little Is known of the new em
peror personally except that he Is an
amiable young man, devoted to his
bourbon wife and as crazy about
hunting and horses as was Franz
Ferdinand- He has cut no figure in'
the war, being blamed for the initial
serious errors, of strategy and heavy
losses on the Italian front while dur
ing recent months he has been chief
ly in Vienna, only occasionally visit
ing the fronts on inspection work.
His political affiliations are believed
to be the same as his predecessors
and now Count Tlsza, the leading
Germanophlle will be more than ever
the ruling power In the dual mon
archy. No one' belleveis Fran's Josefs
death will break up the empire under
existing conditions whatever might
have been its result if it had happen
ed during peace.
Vienna, (via London), Nov. 25.—
Charles I. of Austria, the new ruler
of the dual empire, was born on Aug.
17, 1S87, at the imperial chateau of
Persenberg, overlooking the Danube
valley. His childhood training was
entrusted to the Archduchess Marie
Therese and the Archduchess Maria
Josefa, assisted by an English gov
erness. He Is credited with having
shown a considerable precocity in
learning to read and write and to have
developed a speoial ability In acquir
ing languages.
When he was 17 years of age the
young prince Joined the First regi
ment of Uhlans as lieutenant and was
later transferred to the Seventh regl
ment*of Dragoons. His military edu
cation was Interrupted in 1907 when
he commenced the study of law at the
University of Prague. He was grad
uated the following year and return
ed to his regiment, being promoted to
captain on Nov. 1. 1910- Three
weelcs later he was married to Prin
cess Zlta of Parma, a member of the
Italian -Bourbons. He remained with
the army and In 1912 was promoted

of the Wiener Zeitung has published
the following farewell words of Em
peror Francis Joseph to his peoples,
army and navy, according to a Vienna
dispatch to Reuter's by way of
Amsterdam

Under Stern Wheel.
San Francisco, Nov. 26.—A launch
carrying 60 sailors to the naval sup
ply ship Glacier was overturned hero
today by the *. river steamer Apache,
which was hacking out from her
berth. One man is known to have
been drowned- A roll call probably
will be necessary to determine wheth
er any others were lost.
The launch, putting off crowded
with men returning from shore leave,
was swept by the tide under the stern
wheel of the Apache. A big steel pad
dle blade sheared oft the stem of the
launch which, sank like a stone. A
fleet of small, boats rushed to the
Bcene, and began picking up the men.
The United States cruiser- South
Dakota, anchored a mile away, rush
ed her launches to the rescue and
picked up the first body. Other sea
going tugs and launches scattered
from piers allotted to various towing
companies and clustered around the
Apache. To ths~ t.yQ that these craft
were so near at hand is attributed the
remarkable small'loss of life.

Austro-German troops have crossed

New German Offensive.
Berlin, Nov. 25.—(By Wireless to
Sayville)—While the advance of the
German and Austro-Hungarlan armies
in western Wallachia shows their
pushing force is unbroken, says the
Overseas News Agency, the Teutonle
allies at the same time have started
an offensive in the northern Car
pathians of Moldavia. Combats over
the last piece of Hungarian soil held
by the Russians near Tulghes pass de
veloped into an extensive mountain
battle. On this sector of the front the
advance of the army of Gen. Von Arz,
which had pushed the Rumanians
back had come to a standstill.
The point of approach was strong
ly fortified for defense and was at
tacked first by the Rumanians and
then by the Russians, the latter of
whom devoted especial attention to
this sector.
At a distance of only fifty kilomet
ers, Gyimes pass and farther south-
ward, Uza, Ocna and Oitoz passes
gave open outlets to Moldavia.

they co-rfta obtain only- temporary and
small advantages by disregarding the
sacrifice of men. On November 10,
the allied troops (Teutonic) attacked
and in one day re-conquered the
whole terrain. Then the allies con
tinued their offensive. Moutalns of
considerable height made their ad
vance difficult, but, says the Overseas
Agency the Teutonic troops in 24
hours overcame all obstacles and
reached the mountain village of
Tulbhes.
The Russian line which until then
ran from west to east was forced in
to a northern-southern direction. This
change which tactically was most im
portant, was the first success and it
was immediately extended. The great
est difficulty was yet to be overcome.
Abrupt mountains, some rising to a
height of 3,600 feet, must be taken
and the attack carried far into the
Putna valley and beyond it.
Cross Valley on November 12.
On November 12 the valley was
crossed. This success in the center

garian troops advanced against Bekas

retreat in the Barosculiu-Saca valley.

troops cut the Russian communica

The Russians, therefore, could no
more move their troops between
Bekas and Tulghes passes. The al

tne Hugyes plateau, 1,500 meters
high, the possession of which, says the
Overseas Agency, will decide the fate
