IHEPUBLICANLEADERSINCAPABLE
As was expected, the old bogey
prohibition "has again come to the
front to muddle the political waters
in Kentucky, and as In the past
will create more havoc in the Demo
cratic party than in the Republi
can. The stinging and decisive de
Teat of McChesney by Stanley in the
1915 primary encouraged Democrats
In the belief that the result would
mean, the elimination of the prohi
bition question dn the Democratic
party for some time to come. There
was no question in the minds of the
-voters as to what the candidates
represented. Messrs. Stanley and
McDermott ireceived the votes of
those who favored either county
unit or some liberal policy, w.hile
McChesney had been selected by the
Haly-Beckham alliance to make the
race on a strictly dry platform,
Beckham choosing McChesney as
.the candidate and Haly choosing
the issue, tho latter believing that
the time was ripe to unite all of
.the anti-saloon leaguers and fanatics
and secure control of the Demo
cratic party. McOhesney's nomina
tion would have 'been the starting
point of a reign of fanaticism In
iho Democratic party, the Beckham
Haly plan being to ostracize, any
Democrat that would not subscribe
to their beliefs and then dictate
the nominations in every city, town
or hamlet in the State. That plan,
If successful, would have put a pre
mium on hypocrisy in the Demo
cratic party and shoved to the front
a lot of narrow-minded prohibition
advocates, whose only claim to
Democracy was that no one had
caught them in the act of taking a
drink.
Realizing that Beckham has lost
caste with the present national ad
ministration and is growing weaker
ilkt&M- tS . PQliJaiowerjiy
;;ecs -tho IiandwrltingsEbnrithe wall
and Is once again attempting ro
secure control of Kentucky Democ
racy, with prohibition as the lev
erage to secure that control. The
sathering here last week of prom
inent men from different sections
of the State for the formation of an
organization to bring the prohibi
tion question to the fore bears all
the ear-marks of Percy's fine Italian
hand, several of the gentlemen
oamed being life-long Beckham
Huly adherents. In that connection
it Is not known whether they all
are Beckham-Haly supporters flrst
and Democrats next, but this much
is known, the two Louisville repre
sentatives mentioned, Col. P. H. Cal
lahan and Henry M. Johnson, were
.suporters of Wood Axton, the Bull
Moose nominee for Mayor, against
Mayor Buschemeyer, tho Democratic
nominee dn 1913, and they do say
that Percy Haly flitted dn and out
during that campaign, giving all
possible aid to Axton's candidacy.
It would seems from this that Ken
tucky Democracy can hardly follow
-the dictates of tho above self-appointed
organization dn conducting
the affairs of the party. Practical
politicians see that the Haly-Beckham
plan Is to kill two birds with
one stone, defeat OUie James for
.Senator in 1918 and re-elect Beck
ham in 1920.
Local political attention Is being
turned to the entries for the Demo
cratic primary nominations next
rear, as all realize that a good tic
ket will win easily, when It Is taken
Into consideration that the local
Republican organization in the re
cent election was beaten decisively,
despite the handicap of tho 'heaviest
Republican campaign fund and
negro vote In history. Some of the
disgruntled Republican workers say
that the fund was not used for
election expenses, but that thou
sands of dollars were used to bet on
Highes all over the district, the
local G. O. P leaders taking their
cue from Wall street, which be
lieved that by betting a whole lot
of money your candidate was sure
of success. Another and detri
mental feature to 'local Republican
'fuc.oesB is the crude tactics of the
present Republican dictators. In
every campaign for the past several
years the Chjlton-Searcy machine
sends out the day before election
a glaring circular to Democratic
election officers and workers, warn
ing them if they don't be good they
will be prosecuted, citing Che awful
iate of tho Republican election
thieves in Terre Haute. The same
-old bogey circular was sent again
this past election, being a sort of
stop-thief method, while imported
ncirmM were being voted, but the
point Is that the present Republican
machine follows the old stereotyped
methods and sadly needs tho brains
of an Albert Scott, George Long,
George Todd or Ed Green, who aro
smart politicians.
Sheriff Chailey Cronan is still
-getting the call for the Democratic
nomination for Mayor, with ox
Mayor Head being among those
mentioned, lumor having dt that
our ex-Mayor cleaaed. up, aa they

tatad having ajptile plunge in the
jarlawry. Al Emler seems to have
the support of many of tho leaders
for Sheriff, with Herman Cqhn, Joe
Overberg and Will McNally as men
tioned entries. Those who study
the game say that Will McNally
pill not even enter for two reasons,
despite the Post's dally .mention,
first because a lawyer would hardly
drop 'his practice for the position
of Sheriff, and secondly and prin
cipally he could not consistently run
for Sheriff with Charley Cronan a
candidate for Mayor, both being
known and Identified with the same
Democratic clubs and district since
their entrance into the political
arena. The candidacy of both would
bo antagonistic to the opinions of
Democracy, which believes that to
the victor belongs the spoils as long
as all the spoils are not placed in
one basket. Either Mr. Cronan or
Mr. McNally would have to rotlre
and It is believed that Mr. McNally
will step aside for Mr. Cronan, who
In the opinion of many has tho prior
right.
Jailer Charles Foster on his
splendid record will be unopposed
next year, while" W. H. Meffert or
his assistant, Owen Cochran, win
bo the candidate for Auditor.
Adolph Schmitt will bea candidate
for City Tax Receiver, with Charles
Mllliken as a possible opponent.
Andrew M. Sea, present Tax Re
ceiver, will be a candidate for City
Treasurer. Judge Boldrick, Thomas
Walsh, Hunter Buike and Neal
Funk are being mentioned for Po
lice Judge. Judge Greene, Loral no
Mix and Tyler Barnett are talked
of for County Judge. Allen Smith,
with the backing of John and Ed
Barry, will 'be a good bet for
County Assessor. Joe Ludwlg Is
the flrst Jn tho field for County
Commissioner and is making a
good campaign. Rumors of a dark
horse against Pres Ray will not
down, and with the rumor goes the
story of a pot of several thousand
dollars raised to aid the above, dark
horse. Talk of an opponent for
Judge Shack Miller for tho Court
of Appeals is already being aired
and Judges KIrby, Field and Lin
coln are given frequent mention.
ENJOYABLE ANNIVERSARY.
One of the most enjoyable oc
casions of the past year was the
tenth anniversary celebration of St.
Elizabeth's Auxlllaryof the Knights
of St. John on Thursday night of
last weqk at St. Peter's Hall, Seven
teenth and Garland. The hall was
tastefully decorated with the na
tional colors and at an early hour
was thronged with friends of the
ladles and the Knights. There was
a great cheer when the drill team,
attired In white and each member
bearing a silk United States flag,
made its appearance. The ladles
were put through an dntricate and
beautiful drill by Col. Paul Breen,
In which they acquitted themselves
in a manner that would do credit to
auy military company now on tlie
Mexican border. . At Its cpn elusion
Hie -assemblage participated' In """a
grand march that led to tables that
encircled the hall and were seated
before a delicious fruit and plate
supper. Following the supper Mrs.
P. J. Breen, who presided, wel
comed the guests in happy manner
and stated the purposes of the aux
iliary before Introducing Rev.
Father Edmund Kaiser, the Spir
itual Adviser and speaker of the'
evening. Father Kaiser said It was
a source og great pleasure and satis
faction to be Invited to say a few
words. The drill, ho said, showed
preparednes with a vim. Through
endeavor and earnest effort there
had been moral and spiritual devel
opment and charitable work had
been advanced. In conclusion he
asserted the auxiliary had been a
source of great benefit to Its every
member, upon whom he bestowed
nls blessing. William M. Hlggins,
the next speaker, congratulated the
ladles and urged them to continue
the work of organization. Ben
Stoesser spoke for the Knights of
St. John, commending the auxiliary
and Col. Breen, whose Indefatigable
work was evidenced through the
drill team. He then called Col.
Breen, presenting him a beautiful
and costly emblem ring of the
Knights of St. John amidst rounds
of applause. The rotund Colonell
was too much surprised to find
Words to express his feelings, and
could only say he was "taken off
Ills feet," but the ring would be
worn with pride and honor. An
hour was given to a reunion, in
which many made application to
become members, the anniversary
being in every way a pronounced
success.
MACKIN COUNCIL.
Mackin Council had another
memorable day Sunday, when the
membership was largely augmented
by the initiation of a splendid class
of young mon. Headed by presi
dent Hubbuch and the officers the
members atended St. Cecilia's
church, receiving holy communion
at the 8 o'clock mass. The sight
Was impressive and gratifying to tho
friends of the council. Shortly after
2 o'clock the Initiatory ceremonies
began, lasting until 5, after which
the old and new members adjourned
to the lower hall, where an excel
lent hot supper was served, about
200 being seated at the tables.
President Hubbuch and others spoke
words of cheer and welcome for
the new members when the olgars
had been passed. This initiation
brings to a close a successful year
for Mackin, and upon all sides are
heard expressions that the present
officers should be given another
term.

NEED FOR MEN VERY URGENT
From Dublin comes news that
leading organizations dn Ireland
have adopted resolutions denounc
ing plans for conscription. Among
them are the Clones Guardians, tho

M. J. Lennon, Chairman of the
Athlone recruiting committee, de
clared he was unalterably opposed
to conscription, and that voluntary
recruiting could be made a success
only when home rule was put Into
operation.
The Celbrlqge Guardians marked
"Read" tho resolution of the Cork
Guardians against compulsory serv
ice, and a similar order was made
with regard to the Corporation
resolution calling for tho release
of the Irish prisoners in England.
The Carlow Guardians have unani
mously passed a resolution strongly
protesting against conscription.
According to London, press dis
patches, Gen. Sir Hugh McCalmont,
writing to the London Dally Mail,
In reply to a correspondent who
said there would bo no more re-
fuellions. says it is always unsafe to
prophesy unless you know, more
particularly if your prophetic in
Btinct is opposed to the facts of
history. The 'observations on mar
tial law, ho adds, being tho cause
of continual distress aro absolutely
opposed to all tho facts as they are.
The Duke of Bedford, in the Lon
don Morning Post, criticizes the
Government for not giving the fig
ures of any deficiencies in Irish
regiments, and says that British
soldiers transferred without their
consent to Irish units serve to con
ceal the lack of Irish-born men In
Irish legiments.
Ireland, saya tho Dublin corre
spondent of the London Times,
"must be either persuaded or com
pelled to support her own soldiers
in France. 1 think that Lloyd
George, in his desire to pour oil
Into Redmond's wounds, exagger
ated the lecrulting blunders, for
which Redmond can not disclaim all
responsibility since he was a power
at Dublin Castle during tho heyday
of Irish' recruiting."
"Mr. Asqulth's words made It
clear," says the Spectator, "that
the Government has not closed tho
door on the Idea of compulsory
service for Ireland. Looking back
we recognize that It might have
been better to coax Ireland along
by gradual stages In company with
ourselves.
"But It Is now too late to go
slowly; the need for men Is very
urgent, and the only praoUcal ques
tion Is whether or not compulsion
could ba applied to Ireland without
any preliminaries. By resorting to
compulsion we should ibe doing
nothing whatever unfair, illegal or
what could be In any way regarded
as unexpected."

ILLS THAT MUST BE CORRECTED
t Negatlveness of any kind goes
but; a little distance. It accom
plishes buL, little at any time, . and
In the end practically nothing.
Criticism .oE false proposals fs In
aeed neededahd needed greatly
but' criticism" which "'Is "not Vfoupled
with a recognition of real existing
evils, responsible for the erroueous
doctrines, and which Is unconnected
with sound and constructive ideas
of positive action is bajren and
wasteful. In the social field, which
should be th9 occasion of so much
grave consideration for us, this is
strikingly the case. There has cer
tainly been enough evidence fur
nished during the past few years
to show that conditions In this
country require radical attention
and lefoim. Tho governmental re
ports as to the distribution of
wealth, the holding of valuable
natural resources by certain small
numbers of the people, the Increase
In land values, the whole uncer
tainty and Insecurity of our eco
nomic structure, should make us
realize that changes aie necessary
for the benefit of the great mass of
the people. It Is this very necessity
for change which gives extreme and
destructive proposals tho occasion
for their existence.
Catholics should therefore not
alone be concerned with the lncoi
rectness and evils of certain Ideas,
but should be equally anxious to
positively find some remedy for the
Injustices which give rise to these
Ideas. They should not spend all
their energies In attacks upon radi
cal propaganda, as necessary as this
may be, but should also strive to
carefully Study the disquietude of
the times and make some step for
ward for its correction. The con
gested conditions in the cities for
Instance, with ajl the social and
economic ills that they contain,
which gie color and excuse for the
spread of birth control among the
poorer classes and the proposition
to confiscate the land, can not be
allowed to continue while we con
tent ourselves merely with a broad
side upon these destructive doc
trines. We must strive to go Into
the depths of these questions and
root out the causes which give a
shade of half truth to these Ideas
which are 'being spread far and
wide. v
This is not an easy task it Is
true, for our social problems are not
simple affairs but very complex mat
ters. One of the great attractions
In such proposals as socialism and
single tax is that they offer a sim
ple remedy as a panacea for all the
ills from which we are suffering.
The causes of our difficulties are
complex and intertwining and a
nirnple remedy at tho best looks at
but one side of a many elded shield.
We must not allow the Intricacy of
the situation to discourage us and
cause us to withdraw. Tho duty
is to meet tho condition and do
Bomethiag In tho matter, and our
reluctance may bring the whole
house of social cards down upon
our necks and thoso of our fellows.
We can take encouragement in
such a view In that leaders are rls-
inn un among us to give us the
proper viewpoint, so much desired,
' Dr. John A. Ryan has already done
much In this direction by his well
known work on "A Living Wage"
and his various smaller articles on
minimum wage legislation. He has
not confined himself to such efforts
as his debate with Hillqult or his
other refutations of Socialism, but
1 has come forward wkh some posl-
live proposals. In his newly Issued
book on "Distributive Justice" ' he
adds another contribution to posi
tive, constructive rerorm. He ac
knowledges that the matter Is com
plex and tedious, but he stoutly
breasts the stream of difficulties and
clearly lays down certain Ideas of
change which will decidedly make
for better and more equitable condi
tions. He does not rest content
with merely showing In a clear-cut
and convincing fashion the errors of
the Socialists and Henry George
men in their attacks on the justice
of private property, but he likewise
states that the right of private
property has been greatly exagger
ated and proceeds to outline cer
tain proposals for relief in regard
to our unsatisfactory land situation
that will do much good. He does
not merely refute radical sugges
tions concerning industrial affairs,
but shows how through a legal
minimum wage, the activity of trade
unions and an Increase In co-operation
wo could do much," together
with other State action, to equalize
the present untenable situation in
Industry. He emphasizes strongly
tho necessity of distributing super
fluous wealth upon (the part of those
who have more than enough to
satisfy their necessary wants. We
note. In other words, throughout
his entire work a positive, con
structive tone that Is refreshingly
welcome.
It is to be hoped that there will
be in this country more efforts In
this direction, not alone In treatises
of this kind but in actual activity
an the part of Catholics toward re
form. They should enter into the
life of the community basing their
actions always on true Christian
principles. These principles, they
must realize, are decidedly positive
in their essence, and so must their
action be. Catholic attacks on So
cialistic and other radical propa
ganda should not be mere apologies
for capitalistic and agrarian ex
ploitation and oppression. There
must bo the clear and positive view
that present Ills must be corrected,
but In the right way. That Is the
thing greatly to be desired.

SELECTING BISHOPS.
Selection of the Bishops of the
Catholic church in the United
States, under a recent ruling of the
Vatican, will be made under the
old system which was in use here
until twenty years ago, according to
a dispatch from Rome published In
the Tablet, the official organ of the
diocese of Brooklyn and Long
Island. Tho dispatch reads:
"The new procedure for the se
lection of American Bishops, which
has been ordered by Pope Benedict
X.V. through tho Conslstorlal Con
gregation, abolishes the system of
the submission of a. terna'.of, names
chosen by ;the Irremovable, rectors
after Jthqdeath ot aBlsTiepto the
Bishops of an e'cdesIasTIcarprovInce.
Pope Benedict's new order estab
lishes In Its stead a system of
prlvato Inquiry by the Bishops of
each province to select suitable
priests, whose names are to be
secretly balloted for at a meeting
of the Bishops held under the presi
dency of tho Archbishop. The
names of those chosen are to bo for
warded to Rome, so that the Pope
can make a selection and an ap
pointment immediately, avoiding in
this way tho delay which Is de
clared to be the principal reason
for tho changing of the present
procedure. A special feature of the
new system Is the strict secrecy
'sub gravl' enjoined throughout the
Inquiry and the selection of three
names by the Bishops."
Catholic priests expressed the
opinion that the change makes tho
status of the United States, with
Its twenty million Catholics, that .of
a missionary country. For a score
of years tho irremovable rectois
have been selecting their own Bish
ops. After the death of a Bishop
they would meet with the diocesan
council and select the names of
three men, which they sent to
Rome. Under the new order the
power reverts to the Bishops of the
province and the rectors have no
voice in the selection.
