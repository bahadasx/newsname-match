VILLA VICTORY WOULD
COMPLICATE SITUATION
Fall of Chihuahua to Bandit Chief Would
Upset Plans for Withdrawal ef
.'. American Troops
BELIEVE CARRANZA
WILL SIGN PROTOCOL
Agreement Provides for Conditional Re
tirement of U. S. Troops and Separ
ate Control of Border
By United Press.
Washington, Nov. 25. A Villa vic
tory at Chihuahua City now would up
set all plans for the withdrawal of
the United States troops from Mexico,
making conditions in northern Mexico
intolerable, it is believed here.
The American government believes
Carranza is willing to sign the proto
col that has been agreed upon by the
joint commission at Atlantic City
though he may balk at the provision
for United States troops to follow
bandits into Mexico.
The protocol provides for the with
drawal of the American troops within
forty days, if conditions do not pre
vent it. It also provides for separate
control of the border with co-operation
if possible.
The discussion of Mexican Internal
problems will likely be taken up when
the commission reconvenes in Decem
ber. COUNCIL IN
. MEETING
Will Consider Building and Other Ordi
nances, But Sixteen Year Old 1 im't
Will Not Be Changed
Owing to the inability ot any of the
officials of the rating and inspection
bureau of the Oklahoma Fire Under
writers association to attend the fire
test today it is likely that the city
council will meet at 7:30 this evening
and take definite action with refer
ence to the draft of a new building or
dinance without outside advice. It is
believed that though this is a model
law drafted for the benefit of towns
seeking a lower key rate that some
parts of it can be modified so as not
to work a hardship on property own
ers and still be acceptable to the in
surance people.
At the same time it is believed that,
in the event of the presence of six of
the councilmen, parts ot the traffic or
dinance will be repealed with refer
ence to the dollar license fee, and al
so the question of an examination fee
will bo definitely settled.
It was stated today, however, that
the indications are good that the law
placing the age limit at sixteen at
which children may drive cars will
not be altered or amended.
The concensus of opinion among
members of the council is that this
limit should not be reduced as such a
course enlarges the risks attached to
automobile traffic. Notwithstanding
this there are a few people in Chick
asha, officials aver, who insist that
children under that age should be per
mitted to drive cars but these people
are car owners with boys or girls who
havo been doing much of the driving.
FOR GUARDIANSHIP

the county court yesterday for his ap

ries the Carrancista defenders of t'.it

he cannot hold out much longer
against the attacks of the bandits.
Shortly after daylight this morning
Villa began to attack the city from
three sides.

on Santa Rosa hill at 5 o'clock this
morning and attempted to silence it,

MORE DAtfS
TO COMPARE
EXPENSESOF
OKLA. CITES
Mayor Coffman Believes CLickacha is Run
on Half the Money Which is Required
lo Keep Similar Towns Going
When Mayor Coffman, accompanied
by Mrs. Coffman, attends the annual
convention of the Municipal League
which will be hold in Oklahoma City
next Monday and Tuesday at which
mayors and officials from many cities
. fthe state will be present, he will
pay particular attention to the cost
of maintaining other cities in Oklaho
ma the size of Chlckasha, especially
those which have a commission form
of government. Mayor Coffman wants
to draw a comparison between the ex-
penses of running Chlckasha and tho
cost of keeping similar towns going.
He believes that the cost of governing
the average city of this size in the
states is practically double that re
quired here. Bartlesvllle is an exam
ple. The cost is double. One factor
contributing to the high cost of main
tenance in that city is the cost of the
city commission itself, which is com
posed cf three men, each of whom
draws $2,000 a year.
Mayor Coffman attended the first
mayors' convention at Muskogee some
years ago and at that time came to
the conclusion that a commission form
of government was not beneficial to
a small or medium sized town or city.
FIRE TEST
PROVES BIG
SUCCESS
Four Streams Played Into Air Simultane
ously Throw Water Higher Than
Top ot First National
Although the official test of the
new $9,000 motor fire truck b-d not
been completed at the hour of going
to press, the concensus of opinion of
the scores of Chickasha people who
witnessed the performance of the big
I machine would declare it to come up
to all expectations.
Tests of from a single line to four
streams playing simultaneously were
made on Fourth street near Chicka
sha and the quartet of hose lines sent
a stream up higher than the First Na
tional bank building and with great
force.
Chief Gattis, whose decision
the council will be largely Influenced,
expressed satisfaction at the manner
in which the streams were prilled
into the air but stated that the test
had not been concluded when asked
for his decision a 2:30 o'clock.
Among the Oklahoma fire chiefs
who were present and witnessed the
test were Chiefs Shepherd of Lawton,
Slemp of Anadarko, Haley ot Fair
view, Barnthouse of Guthrie, McCain
of El Reno, Brooks and Master Me
chanic Noble of Oklahoma City.
The test was conducted by the
American Le France Fire Engine coru
panythrough their represenstative, E.
L. Burtner, and C. R. Raynes, a sales
man, from Dallas.
Chief Ingalls of the Inspection and
rating bureau of the Oklahoma Un
derwriters association, could not be
present, neither could he send any of
his men at this time but hoped soon
to avail himself of the opportunity of
seeing a test of the new engine and of
making whatever test of it the local
department may desire.

ENID WINS
OVER H. S.
ELEVEN
Locals Lose to North Defenders 13 to 0
Alter Hard Fought and Clean Caraa
on Muddy Field
C. H. S. SQUAD ENTERED
GAME AT DISADVANTAGE
From Kichoff Enid Maintained Posilic o
of Advantage on Ploughed Field Due
to Superior Weight
In one of the most arduous games
for the local eleven fought this sea
son on account of existing circumstan
ces, Reed's men sold a fiercely con
tested victory to the warriors of the
blue and gold on the latter's gridiron
yesterday. This was the first time
this season that losers have failed to
pull across a victory nor did the win-
nt-.'s of yesterday's battle deem It an
easy accomplishment.
Supported by an aggregation of al
most one hundred and fifty loyal fans,
the hitherto Invlnclhlo locals sallied
forth for northern bacon only to find
that their tryHting place was to be a
soggy, ploughed field, on the like of
which they were not accustomed to
play. The Enid grid had been recent
ly "tilled" and late rains had render
ed it unfit for service. All the passen
gers of the special train quickly real
ized that it would be practically futile
for the purple and gold to battle their
eavler opponents on such a field.
Undaunted by these discouraging cir
cumstances, however, Reed's men en
tered an unequal contest with odds
anging bo against them that little
could bo expected but a narrow vic
tory for the1 E. II. S.
Maintained Vantage Point.
The game was an interesting one
from beginning to end. From the klck:
off, Enid maintained a position of van-
U.xe due to their superior weight
Drop and place kicks were anticipated
but never attempted. Line plunging
proved the most reliable ground gain
er for the victors while passing was
the only alternative for C. H. S. Even
the thus unfavorable conditions could
but fail to hide the stellar Buper-llne
tackling of Riddle, and Capt. Grif
fith's detention work. The Hills dfs
played their usual ability in the back
field, but owing to the slippery foot
ing, end runs were almost impossible.
Gardner at right end escaped with sev
eral long tosses, once rushing the ball
to tho enemy's one yard line thereby.
Chickasha guards heid their more
portly adversaries eommendably under
the strain of unequal odds and the en
tire crew Is to be congratulated uport
the plucky scrap held out to the last.
The lack of Goctting was strongly
felt when, with a more formidable
lino with Griffith to fill his old posi
tion at tackle, the former could prob
ably have reversed the score by his
long end runs and unerring passes
from full.
The Enid squad played a very clean
game and received both visiting team
and rooters very royally. Both touch
downs for the defenders were made
by forward heaves across the C. H. S.
goal and a goal kick after the latter
raised their count to 13. At the end
of the first quarter neither tJi had
-cored but Enid had assumed the of
fensive. During the second quarter,
I he blue and white passed across the
line for the first scoring. An attempt
ed goal failed. At the beginning of
the second half, the C. H. S. fought
still more determinedly than In the
first. In the third quarter, Enid again
crossed the line and kicked goal.
Hill of O. U. refereed the game.
