Better see Strauss as the time
is coming that childrens eyes
have to be looked after more
-than grown folks in order to get
along at school. Trust a man
like Strauss with 26 years ex
perience. All work the best.
vl pit to treat the opposition fairly
bat X insist on a fair return. - I am
wilting to admit that the President
probably does not want to get the
country into a war witb European
power. Kow let tb opposition
admit the a ell known fact that bis
course has been such as to encourage
imposition and make war more pro
. Conversation between t wo voters
discussing local candidates, overheard
on election day:
"Who are you going to vote for?" '
"I intend to vote for blank
"Why, blank is so crooked be, has
to sleep standing up." .
- A democratic member of the Ar
kansaw supreme court has-resigned
to accept an election to .the United
States Senate. Seems to me that
Hughes got a skinning for a si miliar
act. -
But of course the election . is over
and speaking of the ox that is gored,
a great deal depends on. the owner
ship of tiie animal. -.-
The old notion of states rights bobs
up every now and then to plague us.
Our electoral college method of elect
ing presidents is a bungtesome affair
which had its origin in jealousy be
tween the original thirteen states.
Hughes and prohibition . carried
Michigan. Wilson and the open sal
oon carried Missouri, Be. your own
brakeman.. "
o "
Michigan had two temperance prop
ositions up for decision. ' One was
local opt Ion and the other prohibi
tion, and the people decided in favor
of prohibition. However, prohibi
tion by states is only local option - on
a large seals, i With open saloons In
near-by states and across the line in;
Canada, Michigan will nave a bard
time enforcing prohibition. Prohibi
tion in. Missouri would be a good
Ua'og for Kansas.' '-: ' - -
A tur therein lies one reason wby-X
am ra Republican. . Such matters as
suffrage,: prohibition, marriage and
divorce laws can be managed beat
and made most effective it. placed . in
the bands of the general government.
Kansas Is not the only state which
gives Its Probate Judges long terms
of service. - In Michigan many of
them have served from 12 to 16 years;
at least two have served 28 years, and
In Wayne county (Detroit) Hon. E.
Durfee is now serving his 40th con
secutive year as Judge of the Probate
Court.
Every lew days you hear a new ex
pression. A voter-who was talking
about the recent election said,
'Hughes is too fast-Wilson is too
slow, and Teddy has too much X pow
der in the head."
Returning public thanks for -an
overwhelming majority is a good deal
like rubbing it in on the other fel
low.
Returning' thanks for a vigorous
defeat would indicate that , there is
such a thing as a "good loser."
Probably the only effective thanks
or valuable . show of gratitude is a
faithful performance of one's duty to
the best of bis knowledge and ability
o
The political whirligig tarns every
which a-way. The co-workers of one
campaign are vigorous opponents in
the next. A candidate receives sup
port rom quarters where it Is least
expected and falls where it is most
depended upon, and very often sup
port or non-support turns upon some
trifling incident which the candidate
has forgotten or possibly has never
heard ofi ; ': ' ' " -,----:
Voters are sometimes governed by
sentiment, sometimes by fear, and
sometimes by spite, envy or ven
geance. Perhaps a bare majority are
governed by judgment and very often
that lodgment is based on faulty or
Insufficient information. We all are
human.
' Poverty and politics make strange
bedfellows, Worse yet, the making
and remaking of the beds kicks up
an aggravating dust.
o -
In politics a man will do more to
punish a supposed enemy than he
will do to help his best friend. That
is some men are built that way. Ton
and I are different.

MARKET REPORT . - " "
' Kansas City Stock Yards, Kov.-21,
1&16. Cattle buyers picked around
today, good feed steers and'all grades
of cows steady and active, medium
steers 19 to 15 lower, Blockers and
feeders weak.. Hogs met an extra
strong demand, market 10 to 20 high
er, some sales of hogs under 200 lbs
25 taj 35 higher. Sheep sold 10 to 15
higher, a late sale of Iowa fed west
erns at the top, tll.65.
Be?f Steers The record $11.75 for
steers made yesterday stood good to
day, be best steers fie re selling at
tl0. to SU.23, fully steady. Short
feed Steers at S3 to $10.50 were not
much different,- but from these down
to tail end grass steers around $6 50,
the market was slow and 10 to 15
lower. ' Cows and canners held steady,
choiqe heavy cows up to $3.50, fair to
goodjeows $5.75 to $7.00, canners $4.50
to $5 00. Bulls' are a quarter higher
than last week, choice heavy ones up
to $7, 'strong demand .for bologna
bulls at $5 25 to $6. Veals are steady
this week, best at $11. , - .
Stackers and Feeders Threatening
weather was. a factor in making a
weak; market on stockers and feeders,
lack of quality also working the same
way.; A few fleshy feeders are selling
above $8, this kind more easily secur
ed Xhlsf week tecau8e packers are not
as keen for '"them, fair to thin good
feeders ' S6.7S to' $7.50-. . Best stock
calves sell up to $8, good to choice
yearlings $7 to $7.50, fair kinds $6.25
to $S.7. common ones down to $5.25.
A margin of 3 to 4 cents a pound
ought to stimulate the demand for
feeding steers, but hih corn Is being
given undue weight in the considera
tion, and demand for the cattle lags.
- Hogs First estimate called for 21,
000 bogs, Jater raised to 23,000, but
all hands had. urgent orders, and the j
close of . the market was . its best
point, 2D higher than yesterday, top
$10, bulk of sales $9.40 to $9.90. Light
hogs were often a quarter higher,
sometimes more, a conservative sales
man admitting that he sold 200 lb
bogs a( $9.85 today -for which kind be
-wbtfck,n4a. haen glad t take $9.50
Vate yesterday.; Packers -take the
hogs wUUngjy when runs are heavy,
having a wide- outlet for the manu
factured product -at big profits, and
tbelr demonstration for lower prices
are made on days when, receipts are
light. .The present' range looks per
fectly safe for tine time being. -
Sheep and Lambs Lambs sold. 10
to 15 higher, receipts only 3,000 head.
The first pea fed lambs of the season
arrived from Colorado yesterday and
sold at the top, $11.50. Receipts are
exceedingly light, and the market
quickly recovers from each break.
Twelve dollars was paid here for
lambs last week, top in Chicago same
day $11.85. Fat ewes sell at $7.25 to
$7.75. Feeding lambs are higher, $9.
75 to $10.40.

- FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF 1
Getting money is not an easy mat
ter. It takes brains and effort, and
muscle and sweat and toil to land a
dollar. And every man, earning his
own dollar, has a right to spend it as
lie sees fit. That's his privilege a
privilege, none dare deny. The great
question is,bow can the man who owns
a dollar spend that dollar to the best
advantage? How can he get the most
for his money? How can he best use
it for his own good of his own com
munitv? If you have a dollar to
spend, here is a plan you might try
out it might help you to get honest
value for an honest dollar. Make out
a list of the things you wish to buy.
Go to your home dealer and show him
this list. . Tell blm just how much
money you wish to spend. Have him
to show you the goods be carries.
Examine each article carefully note
the makes, the. brands, the quality
Ask the merchant any questions you
may wish to ask. Get him to give
vou his prices. Talk the matter over
with him, heart to heart J ust as you
would talk -over any other matter
with any other friend. The borne
dealer can not expect you trade with
him unless he gives you honest values
for your money. He hopes to get
business on merit only. But you can
not well know just what goods your
home dealer has in stock you can
not know the quality you can not
know the prices he will make on your
bill, unless you go to blm direct.
When it comes to spending your own
dollar, you should make your own in
vestigation. You should see the
poods that are offered at home. You
can't afford to take any chances on
overlooking a real bargain in a local
store.- it isn't the business of the'
man In the tug city to teit you how
etieap you can buy things la your
boms town. You must find that out
for yourself (Copyright, 1916.)
