FOR STATE ML
TO CUT com COST
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 24.—State
o./ned canals between the anthracite
coal fields and this city are proposed
as a solution of the coal transporta­
tion question. This suggestion is "made
in a letter from ex-Mayor William A.
Magee, Pittsburgh, to counsel for the
state commission now probing high
coal prices here.
Magee maintains state-owned ca­
nals could transport coal to this city
for 60 cents a ton. The railroads now
charge $1.40 a ton.
Coal and transportation men try to
ridicule the proposition, claiming the
canals would be useless in summer
for lack of water and would freeze In
winter. They did not explain how
New York managed to keep the Erie
canal in working order, or how canals
in states where they are not throttled
by railroads succeed in earning profits.
INDIANAPOLIS STRIKE
HANGS ON RULING
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Nov. 23.—
The question of whether or not union
employes of the Indianapolis street
car company will call a strike hinged
today on a decision to be handed down
by the United States court of appeals
in Chicago. The street car company
following the last strike obtained an
injunction in United States district
court here, which would prevent the
unions from interfering with the oper­
ation of cars. The decision, handed
down by Judge Anderson, was ap­
pealed.

GREAT BRITAIN MAY HAVE
GENERAL STRIKE ON HANDS
LONDON,'Nov. 24.—The enormous increase in the cost of living
lias driven the organized miners of Scotland to demand the calling of
a national labor conference.
The miners of Wales threaten to call a general strike at the' end
of November, unless the government by that time has taken steps
to remedy the situation.
These demands have been indorsed by the national federation
of British railway employes and the federation of transport workers.
Robert Williams, secretary of the transport workers' federation,
declared that all British labor unions agree on the need of immedi­
ate government measures to remedy the high cost of living.
Unless drastic steps are taken now/f'
said Williams, the four pound loaf of
bread will rise to one shilling: (24
cents), and all other foodstuffs will
be raised proportionately.
In order to buy one pound of
sugar housewives must now give up
two shillings' worth of other neces­
sities. On the other, hand, luxuries
can still be bought plentifully on
easy, terms.
Employers Blockade Unions,...
Contrary to the declaration of
Walter Kunetman, president of* tt»e
chamber of commerce, the ship own­
ers are maintaining a, blockade
against the transport workers' union,
Mr. Williams said. They are "starv­
ing their own workers worse than tile
German enemy.
The unions will first exhaust every
other means, before they declare a
"strike, but if nothing else will do,
this last resort will have to be tried.
The potato crop in Great Britain is
plentiful this year, Mr. Williams as
^serted. Yet a ton of potatoes now
^costs 11 pounds sterling.
The great landowners have thou­
sands of acres planted in potatoes
and are reaping great fortunes, while
the mass of the consumers impov­
erished and driven to desperate
straits.

DEMOCRACY. YULE
BOSTON, Nov. 24.—That the mak­
ers of *his country's constitution
were far from demigods, and that the
great document itself was an expres­
sion of the propertied interests of
that day, were two of the statements
by Prof. Max Farrand, Yalfs, which
startled his aristocratic audience at
the Lowell institute.
The lecture was one of a series on
American history, and was replete
with statements that the constitution
of the United States is a class docu­
ment in origin.
Made Class Laws.
"The constitution must be recog­
nized," declared Farrand in one of
the high lights of his speech, "as the
work of the propertied ruling class.
Although it made no property qual­
ifications itself, it left the determina­
tion of the voting privileges to the»
several states, which did have prop­
erty qualifications."
The success of our government for
over 125 years under the constitution
has led us to regard that document,
said the lecturer, as almost superhu­
man in its perfection. Without be­
littling the constitution, or decrying
its success, we can at least attempt
to show that its making was a thor­
oughly human piece of work. It
should 'thus become more understand­
able as a working instrument of gov­
ernment.
Gave No Democracy.
It cannot be said that the enact­
ment of the constitution established
democracy in America. Even the
revolution had not established de­
mocracy. It had not existed in colo­
nial times. Monarchical and aristo­
cratic rule was still largely a social
habit and institution.
The people were accustomed to a
ruling class and to. accept the dic­
tates of a superior social group. The
revolution did help the cause of de­
mocracy by driving out the Tory or
ruling class and by breaking down
old distinctions and bringing forward
new men. But the whole generation
of the revolution could really be es­
tablished.
"Democracy," said Professor Far­
rand, "was the result of forces work­
ing under and beyond the constitu­
tion, which had to be interpreted,
that is, twisted and wrenched to meet
the situations not provided by for a
class which was not essentially dem­
ocratic."
TRY LABOR MAN FOR
POLITICAL ACTIVITIES
PEORIA, 111., Nov. 23.—One of the
most unusual labor conventions ever
held in Illinois was called to order
today by Lyle McArthur, president of
the Peoria Trades Assembly, who ex­
tended a welcome to the delegates rep­
resenting the Illinois Mine Workers.
They are assembled here to try Presi­
dent Frank Farrington, charged with
violating the laws of the state organi­
zation by sending out a circular lit­
ter which was an endorsement of
Frank Smith, recent candidate for
the Republican nomination of gov­
ernor of Illinois.

NEW YORK, Nov. 24.—The four
month's strike of the 2,700 textile
workers of the New York Mills cor­
poration, in New York Mills, N. Y.,
has just ended in a complete and
sweeping victory for the workers and
for union organization. "One of the
greatest victories ever securfti' by, the
United Textile Workers of Ame.rico",
are the words in which the settlement
of the strike is described by John Gol­
den, general president of the United
Textile Workers of America.
1
In a letter conveying the thanks of
the Executive Board of the Textile
Workers to the committee on indus­
trial relations for the help given by
the committee in exposing the wrongs
done to the striking workers, and in
bringing about the victory of the
workers, Golden gives the terms of
settlement as follows:
"A 10 per cent increase in wages to
all the strikers.
"All those evicted from the com­
pany tenements to be placed back in
the houses from which they were
evicted.
"No rents to be paid by the ten­
ants for those weeks between July
18th and Oct. 21st.
"Recognition of the union commit­
tee.
"All strikers to be reinstated in
their former positions or other posi­
tions just as good, without discrimin­
ation.
"Abolition cf the card system which
prevented an employee from securing
work in any other mill connected with
the company, after they had left their
previous employment."
These terms are an absolute con­
cession of everything demanded by
the workers. The splendid signifi­
cance of the victory to trades union­
ism, is that these 2700 workers, in­
cluding many nationalities, but chiefly
Polish workers, showed the perfect
discipline of organization, and proved
what such labor unionism can accom­
plish for the cause of industrial jus­
tice.
WAS DIRECT ACTI0NIST
AND DIDN'T KNOW IT
EVERETT, Wash., Nov. 23.—One
day last week several men, none of
whom were directly interested in any
dispute between labor and capital
were discussing the I. W. W. tragedy,
some of them took decided stands
against the- men who made up the
party who were not permitted to land
at Everett. When the discussion
dwindled to a single-handed confer
ance one of the particularly outspoken
gentlemen was asked what he would
do if he had been forcibly taken off
his feet (during his freely delivered
discourse or tirade against the so
called I. W. W. element) and carried
to the rural districts and Unmercifully
beaten, he replied he "would immedi­
ately take it up with the authorities."
"Suppose you were told you got just
what was comingJto you?"
"Then I'd get a gun and go after
those who committed the deeds."
DENVER MEN PROTEST
AGAINST LIVING COST
DENVER, Col., Nov. 24.—Denver
Trades and Labor Assembly today
adopted a resolution presented by the
Plumber's and Gas Fitter's union con­
demning the high cost- of living and
calling for the appointment of a. com­
mittee to protest to President Wilson.
The protest will be in the forip- of a
petition and will ask the president and
congress, to take action through on
embargo on exports. The resolution
stated that several commission and
wholesale merchants were in a con­
spiracy to keep prices up by leaving
foodstuffs in ffeight cars on railroad
sidings.
MOTORWOMEN IN PARIS
PARIS, Nov. 23.—Motorwomen on

FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE, ECONOMIC R£F&RM AND POLITICAL PROGRESS.
John Perich, strike organizer, and
Mike Popovich, striking miner, Tyrere
acquitted of riot charges by the Dis­
trict Court at Crosby lasit Tuesday.
This action followed a motion to
dismiss, made, by Attorney John A.
Keyes and A. W. U"hl for the defend­
ants on the grounds that the prose­
cution failed to prove the defendants
guilty.
Perich and Popovich were arrested
on the night of August 11 and
charged with rioting in the streets of
Crosby during. the progress of the
Mesaba Range miners' strike. A
large company of mine gunmen and
thugs charged a, crowd for the ex­
press purpose of getting Perich be­
cause of his organizing activities, -ac­
cording to the story told in court.
Attorney Keyes, during the prog­
ress of the trial, continually objected
to the admission of evidence and re­
fused to present any for the defense,
claiming that the riot ^rtjjarges were
trumped up and that his. client need­
ed no evidence to prove hiff innocence.
The court after reviewitfe the evi­
dence of Prosecuting Attorney S. F.
Alderman of Crow Wing county, dia
Tntsgfed thie charges immediately after
the county" rested its case.
Organizer Perich has made no
plans for his future course.
CHICAGO, Nov. 24.—That the war
department was making efforts to
push military instruction work in the
schools of the nation was admitted
today by local recruiting officers. One
of them said that a definite proposal
to the Board of Education here had
already been made for this purpose,
and that similar moves had been
made or would be made shortly in
Milwaukee, St. Louis and many other
cities.
"So far as I know," he said, "there
are no rules laid down by the depart­
ment, but it encourages and fbsters
all such activities."
Acceptance of the war depart­
ment's "suggestion" to the schools
will result in the placing in public
schools of United States army officers.
These will be required to give in­
struction in military service, it is
said.
The proposal to the local board has
been coupled with the demand {rom
army circles that the teaching of war­
fare be made part of the regular cur­
riculum, and have its place in the
markings by which the pupils are
promoted from grade to grade..
The plan of the army, in brief, is
as follows: ...
Each pupil will be given a rifle,
gun sling, cartridge belt, bayonet,
haversack, canteen, eating utensils,
forty rounds of rifle ball cartridges
and other military equipment. No re
numeration will be given for the first
two years.
The plan is to constitute the male
pupils as members of-the-reserve offi­
cers' training Corps. The secretary of
war has been authorized, under the
training corps law, to maintain train­
ing camps for the students for a pe­
riod of six weeks in every year.
U. S. MAY HAVE

ASHINGTON, Nov. 23.—The war
department announced appointment

on the minor leagues a few days
ago, was indicated by David
Fultz, president of the fraternity,
Fultz Is believed to be ready to
ask all members of the fraternity
to hack up the demands with a
strike If necessary.
Big leagt^e baseball magnates
nave declared they will not sub­
mit to such an agreement.
URGES STATE
NEW YQRK, Nov. 24.—Handling
of foodstuffs by -p-tblic authorities -is
the only way to break prices and cut
down the high cost of living, accord­
ing to John J. Dillon, food commis­
sioner of New York state.
''Federal and county prosecutors
In this state declare we. need new laws
—either federal or state—to stop the
boosting of prices for all foodstuffs,"
says Dillon. "They say the manipula­
tors are well within their leg vi rights
when charging, if the/ desire, $1 for
a
loaf of bread or 50 cents for a quart
of milk, and that none can be prose­
cuted unless it be discovered he has
entered into a conspiracy to set
prices.
"These officials state that it" is very
hard to prove conspiracy, and the
only way to meet the present situa­
tion is to get laws that prevent pur­
veyors of food from charging any­
thing more than what might be
terined an honest profit.
Can Dodge Any Law.
"I disagree with them, for I know
by observation, that any law regu­
lating anything can be dodged by the
men such law is meant to curb. Their
ill-gotten gains give them unlimited
funds for legal talent that will guide
them so they will at all times be
within the law.
"The way to break the prices of
food is for the state to go into the
distribution business* Consider what
the express companies did when the
parcel post was established. Let the
work authorized by this department
be developed and soon there will be
a marked reduction in prices, for in­
dependent food distributors will im­
mediately cut their prices."
WAR VICTIM'S SUPPLIES

have conspired to buy large quantities
of barley and ship them to Berlin,
where they were sold at exhorbitant
prices. Numerous arrests already
have been made.

Professors Feci Force.
"Tha.'s open suppression—some­
thing you can put your hands on. But'
you can't put your hands on the
subtle things. Wheh the president of
a university goes out after an endow­
ment or for money to build Smith
hall or Brown laboratory, he doesn't
like a professor to. go up and down
the by-woys prying into social condi­
tions and telling about them.
"But th&t president may not act at
once. He may wait until the time
comes for the professor to have his
salary raised. The increase in salary
is withheld, and after a time the pro­
fessor either gets out of the university
or else he stops talking. He has chil­
dren in- his family who must be fed.
He wants to keep hU job, so he' puts
on the Soft pedal. Pretty soon the stu­
dents will act the same way—and
then we begin to wonder what's the
matter^ with the body politic."

CONVENTION
"GRAND OLD MAN" STILLS
CONVENTION WITH SPEECH
BALTIMORE, Nov. 24.—In the most radical speech he has ever
made, Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of La­
bor, *threw down the gauntlet of organized labor to organized capital.
Then the union labor chief collapsed, overcome by the frenzy into
which he had worked himself.
For a moment after Gompers had finished the convention was ab­
solutely silent. Then the 400 delegates were on their feet shouting
and cheering, the radical element leading the way.
fflllf COLLEGES,
Secretary Frank Morrison ran to Gompers' side and almost carried
him from the platform.
Gompers' speech -was one of five before the convention Tuesday,
the other four being by representatives of the four big brotherhoods!
The Iteaders of the two organizations are preparing for a joint fight
for better working conditions and against all compulsory arbitration
measures such as President Wilson is planning.
Both sides believe official affiliation only awaits certain formal
steps to be taken by the brotherhoods at their next convention*
8-Hour Day Object.
I
PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 24.—Subtle
influences in control of American uni­
versities and colleges, throttling free
speech and thought, are responsible
for the minds of the American peo­
ple, said Charles McCarthy, chief of
the Wisconsin Legislative Reference
Library, in an address here bofere
the conference on universities and
public service.
"Universities are planted all over
the country like Chinese graves," he
said, "and every one has its hand out
for money. Do you think that pro­
fessors in these universities are go­
ing to fight the power of wealth?
"All over the country," McCarthy
said, "we have in our churches and
colleges a desire to gain endowment
and costly buildings. Whether we
wish it ot not, the very desire makes
it sometimes impossible to protect free
speech in these institutions.
"Out in Stanford university, San
Francisco, a professor started to in­
vestigate coolie labor conditions and
to make speeches on these conditions.
He was told quietly at first that he
had better stop these speeches.
"When the professor kept on
speaking and investigating, Mrs.
Stanford, %hose husband gave mil­
lions to the university, had a dream.
In her dream, she eaid, she had
talked with her husband, and he
wanted these speeches stopped. The
professor didn't stop, and eventually
Mrs. Stanford had another dream.
The professor was fired.
bis
TWO CENTS.
Federation leaders made no secret
of the fact that the primary object of
the proposed affiliating is to bring*
about a universal eight-hour day.
In their speeches the brotherhood
chiefs confirmed the report of the se­
cret conference in Washington Sun­
day with representatives of the rail­
way employes affiliated with the Fed­
eration they extended felicitations to
the federation they apologized for
non-affiliation at this time praised
the federation pleaded for the re­
sults that must accrue from harmony,
and said they and the railway de­
partment of the federation had come
to a perfect understanding of each
other.
Every eye turned to Gompers as he
arose to respond to the chiefs. He
was laboring under intense emotion.
His voice and his body trembled.
Pledges Full Support.
"Men of the railroad brother­
hoods," he began, turning to the four,
presidents, "we of the American Fed­
eration of Labor expect that on the
first day of January every man in
the railroad brotherhoods will inau­
gurate the eight-hour workday. What­
ever may arise, whatever betide, you
will Tr%- behind you the unqualified
support of every man and woman in
organized labor as represented by th*
American Federation of Labor.
"When the money power of the
United States had failed, as it failed i»
the last election, to corrupt and mis­
lead the electorate, when its ends
were frustrated by the American citi­
zenship .at the ballot box, the men
of capital showed their true colors.
"They met—quite a number of
them—and gave to the public, the
declaration that they would antago­
nize every effort put forth by organ­
ized labor, that they would fight us
financially, industrially, legislatively
and politically—they did not need to
say that they already control us judi­
cially. They said that they represent­
ed $8,000,000,000, 15,000 employers
and 7,000,000 working people, and
that they would use all of this to balk,
defeat and undo the work of the
American trade union movement.
Will Accept Challenge.
"Well, they have the right ta do it
They have the right to do it, regard­
less of the fact that we stand for the
manhood, the womanhood, and the
cildhood of this country as against
their billions of wealth."
Then shouting at the top of his
voice Gompers made the declaration
that carried away the audience.
"All that I, as a man, can say In
answer to you men of wealth is this:
'Be careful—you are going too far!
For there is a limit to human en­
durance. Tou throw down the gaunt­
let and we of the working classes
will accept the challenge and fight.*
"Men of the railroad brotherhoods,
in what is befdre you you may count
upon all men of labor in this land of
ours."
With notables of church and state
in attendance,, the thirty-sixth annual
convention of the American Federa­
tion of Labor was formally opened
on the roof of the Garden theater
this morning. Nearly 500 delegates
