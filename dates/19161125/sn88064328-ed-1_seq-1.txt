tick eradication until finished,
you are advised that we are very
unfortunate in recently losing a
man from this force to be trans
ferred to Te*as, and, as he oc
cupied territory that would re

fall and winter months than, per
haps, Iberia Parish will requit
and as the other men on our force
are occupying territory of great
importance where the local otfi
cials are thoroughly cooperating,
it was found that the only man
available for this transfer was

that his withdrawal ffo

of severing our coopertlti

. Of course, you are aware of the
•fact that the Police Jury in 'Ibe
ria Parish arranged to discon
tinue dipping sometime in August,
and that left the Parish with no
protection from the invasion of
outside cattle, only as provided for,
in Act 18, passed by the recent,
Legislature. Cattle could move
v «mV, ^
within the Parish at liberty with-;
out any restrictions, and dipping™
was optional with each cattle,
owner. As soon as the action 0 f,
the Police Jurv became know n ;
the dippings in Iberia fell from ,
12,!)11 for the month of July j
down to 7,693 for the month of,
August and for the month of
September, we have no records of
anv official dippings. However,
the records for the month
of

Ausrust show that, there were only
103 infested herds in the Parish,
which represents 1236 cattle.|

readily see that if they would

he has done rs igood work in the

has been frequently found through
experience that an occasional
change of inspectors in a section,
that is in cases where thev hav

course, does not reflect upon the
