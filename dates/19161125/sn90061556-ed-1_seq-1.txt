SOME RECENT POLICE HAPPENINGS
THE END OF THE WORLD
By BenJ. V. Longdon.
Just as centuries ago men, not a fow,
looked for the end of earthly things,
so now some talk of the end 6f tho
world. What Is Justification? Is It.
the high cost of living or tho success
of many Democratic candidates at
the recent election? Is It the grim
determination of the belligerent na-
tloiis? We think not. Frankly, we
don't see any justification. With not
more than 1-3 of the world' believing
In any fashion in tho Divinity of
Christ -with "man's Inhumanity to
man" looming large we are fain to
bollovo tho end is still remoto un
less, indeed wo should see -a sudden,
wiversal quickening of the spiritual
faculties of men and a realization of
tho need of Christian unity and broth
crhood. The natural signs aro not,
as yet, sufficiently alarming. It is an
open question.. Some brilliant and
gifted men say the world has nearly
reached Its allotted span; others, of
not smaller mental endowments de
clare Uio world is still very young. No
man knows. Either way it i3 not for
us to scoff at tho world as the elegant
refinement and delicacy of speech be
longed to tho artificiality of manners
of tho more fortunate races; as
though tho simplicity and integrity of
conduct and honesty of intention and
domestic virtue had vanished. Just
as the things that we esteem best
survive and take to themselves added
nourishment, so do they give ampler
opportunities and larger compensa
tions than ever before to those who
liavo overcome. If tho world buffets
us let us not be utterly cast down.
And perhaps wocan luckily laugh at
it, and turn its sorry jokes upon it as
happily as Abou Hassan made re
prisal when ho was tho victim of the
Caliph's Jest For Abou sent his wife
to .the Sultan to tell her with much
lamentation that Abou was dead. The
Sultan comforted her and gave her a
sum of money to defray the funeral
expenses. Then Abou went to the
Sultan and told him his wife was dead
and was treated with like generosity.
When the Caliph met his Sultana he
told her Abou had passed away but
she said he "was mistaken It was
Abou's wife who had joined the
Trophet. Then the Sultan sent his
servant to verify Abou's -report but
that worthy seeing his coming
feigned death and was so reported.
The Sultana also sent her servant
but Abou was watchful and this time
It was his wife who counterfeited,
death. Utterly mystified thcCallph
and his Sultana decided to go id .per
son" but when they reached tho house
found Abou and Ills wife both appar
ently dead. And the Caliph, utterly
distracted exclaimed: "I would glvo a
thousand -pieces of gold to know which
died, first," whereupon Abou exclaimed
' "It was, I my Lord and exclaimed
tho reward amid much merriment.
"Every day Is a new beginning.
Every day is the world made new
Yo who are weary of sorrow and sin
ning, Hero is a beautiful thought for you.
A thought for me and a thought for
' -you."

STAR AND LOST TO BROWN,
0 TO 21.-
Threo Long Runs by Flect,Fovted Back
Enabler Providence Eleven to
Down the Crimson Harvard
Strated With Subs.
Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 18. Led by
a dusky meteor , named Pollard,
Brown's powerful football team over
whelmed the Harvard substitutes this
afternoon, 21 to 0.
In every period or tho game the
Brown attack, bullet around the bril
liant Negro halfback, crushed and
plowed its way through the weak
Crimson line
It was a shallow victory, in, that
Harvard not only started her substi
tutes, but many times delayed the
game with constant changes. But
Brown Is happy tonight in the knowl
edge that even with her regulars, Har
vard found It hard to stop tho brilliant
Providence eleven.
' Pollard was the star of the game.
Time and again he slid off tackle or
circled the Crimson ends for long
gains. In the first period It was his
brilliant run back of a Harvard punt
and his 30-yard run froin the Harvard
lOard lino which gave Brown her
first chance to score.
It was Pollard who"' brought the
Brown men to their feet In the third
period when ho went through center
and then dodged and staggered his
way through the entire Harvard team
for a touchdown, after a run of forty-
five yards. In this period Harvard
was penalized for roughing Pollard.
The Crimson showed a flash of
strength at the opening of the final
period, but after Pollard had Intercept
ed a Harvard pass and then caught a
Brown forward pass and ran the length
of tho field, Pnrdy plunged over for
tho third touchdown.

If me nnd ft cracker F.houM have a fight.
And he knocks me in the Jaw,
It's counted to him as being "right"
According to "Cracker" law.
But If 1 swing oti a "Cracker's" Jaw
With all my feeble' might.
Right from that will start a war.
And I'll have the State to fight.
All they've sown against the "nigger,"
They'll r.eap as sure ns you're lorn.
Their time Is out, they can't rftow bigger!
They've dragged my raco to scorn,
Yes, we-will llse up, oye and bye.
Anil make the "Crackers" sink lielow.
Big tears fhall dtop from each one's ee,
They've been warned of this before.
,Mv people are reallyrreat on eaith,
Thoro's.nono no '2X?.le"f found;
He's been a slave trom Jils birth
The South has kept him down.
He's not allowed ns other men
To speak up for his rights.
Do he's shut up in a pen,
.And tortuicd by the white.
We have many noble men.
Hut Ufa South has held them back.
Tho South was never my people's friend
They've kept them In a sack.
Yankeo land! 31y future home,
O, how I long for thee;
Upon thy bosom let me roam
And feel that 1 am free.
We are God's own chosen neonle.
And In h 1 their foes shall hop,
They'ie climbing dally to the place
Where they will be on top. s
All men look alike to God,
No matter how huge they've grown;
All aie subjects to bis rod,
And reap what they have sown.
I would, rather the cold to snatch my
breath.
And die from a natural cause,
Than to stay down South nnd get beat
to death,
I'nder cruel "Cracker" laws.
They tiietl one time to exeit their "Will,"
These rtefuod old gopher diggers,
They asked the government to pass a
"I1II1"
And rid the South of "niggers."
HASTEN ON, MY DARK BROTHER,

NO '.'CRACKERS" THERE TO SEDUCE
YOUR SISTER.
NOR TO HANG YOU TO A LIMB.
AND YOU'RE NOT OBLIGED TO CALL
EM MISTER,
NOR SKIN 'EM BACK AT HIM.
Now why should I remain longer South,
To be dogged and kicked around?
"Crackers" to knock me In the mouth,
And shoot my brother down?
O, no! I won't; I must leave today.
No longer can I wait.
If the Recruiters fall to take me 'way,

NOVEMBER 22 D DECEMBER 4TH

Membership Fee.
Beat Indianapolis, get 700 new
members," was tho slogan of the
campaigners after Captain Edwards of
the Blues made his address to the
workers In which he uttered this in
spiring hope on Thursday evening,
November 21, on the evo' of the an
niversary campaign. Although an un
heard of number of members to get
In one effort by a Colored association,
the enthusiasm of the forty workers
present who braved the chilly rain
made it seem entirely possible ns the
forces of tho Reds nnd the Blues sat
facing each other under the spell of
the enthusiastic, encouraging words
of the speakers.
Captain Austin Young's recital of
the conditions under which he ac
cepted tho captaincy and the stirring
of his men to meet the challenge of
the Blues has never been equalled be
fore In the history of the opening
meeting of a campaign. At tho close
of his address every man present was
ready to talk and Ayork.
Prof. Shelton French of Western
University, In true college style, told
how the Iteds Intended to glvo the
Blues the real "blues." W. II. (Bill)
Houston, always a dangerous oppo
nent in a contest, tho captain of the
winning team In the first membership
campaign held after entering the
building, was loudly applauded when
he said, "the secretary should be In
structed to write Indianapolis imme
diately that Kansas City was going
to take its rightful place of leadership
In membership for the country." He
then showed how many members each
worker should get to bring about the
desired results, pledging his share.
Dr. E. J. Perry, Prof. J. It. E. Lee,
Rev. J. C. VanLoo, Messrs. Leo Rohe,
II. O. Cook, P. C. James, W. G. Mose-
ley and L. C. Stewart in two minute
talks stirred the flames of enthusiasm
to'Wer pitch. G. A. Page, First Lieu
tenant of the Reds, in an impassioned
talk pledged to get at least twenty
new members. James II. Crews, First
Lieutenant of the Blues, was imme
diately on his feet vjlth a pledge of
tweniy-ono or more ior nis captain.
A smile of complete confidence
lighted up Captain Edwards' face;
throughout the evening. Captain
Young seemed to be somewhat wor
ried as to the outcome, even with the
assurance from his members of loy
alty and support. Over all the even
ing's proceedings was a strong spir
itual atmosphere. The memorable

wore his uniform. Asplnwall was
given two years.
Asplnwall lives at 3705 Garfield ave
nue. He met Quinn at the saloon of
George Quinn, the patrolman's broth
er, at Fourth and Grand. Tho two
discussed the robbery, and Quinn took
his brother's motor car to the foot of
the Grand Avenuo hill.
Hid Goods Near Qulnn's Home.
Two box cars were opened. Two
sacks of potatoes valued at ?C were
taken from one, and three boxes of
