THE
TWO VICTORIES
Mark tar Opening of I ho Kaakrtball
Htaxon of the MajsWIle lllarh
Hthool tiermanlown Boys
Easily Defeated.
The opening of the basketball sea
son of the Maysville High School laat
night waa markctl with two victortee
for the home team, Oerinantown going
down by the scores of 26 to 10 and BO
to 80. The Oermantown boys were
hampered by the fact that they were
not accustomed to playing on an in
door court and therefore the games
could hardly be called a real test of the
strength of the Maysville team. The
Oermantown boys played a good game
however but In both Instances Mays
ville piled up scores that could not be
overcome.
The second teams played the first
game. The lineups at the beginning of
the first half wore as follows:
.Havmlllt fierinaatown
Right Forward
Thomas Rubenacker
Left. For ward
Cablish MeNamara
Center
Gelsel Galbreath
' Right Guard
Owens Weiss
IWt Guard
Walker Ellis
Cablish started the half with a foul
goal and Thomas followed suit by
throwing a field goal. The German
town boys then threw a field goal and
a foul. Maysville then forged ahead
and Germantown never came close
enough to cause any uneasiness
The first half closel with the score 10
to 7. In the second half Thomas for
Maysville played a star game. Al
though he is very small he has the
happy knack of getting loose from his
opponents. He threw four field goals
and one foul goal until his removal
from the field. The entire lineup of
the team was changed. Barbour tak
ing Thomas' place, Dickson, Cablish's;
Hicks. Geisel's; Dawson, Owen's, and
Caplinger Walker's. The final score
was 26 to 10.
The second game started off much
more lively than the first The line-up
w:ia as follows:
Mayrtlllr Oermantown
1 Center
Wood MeNamara
Right Forward
Smoot McKlbbcn
1,0ft Forward
Kverett fltowell
' Right Guard
Downing Jono
Left Guard
Browning Moore
The game opened with a foul gon!
pitched by MeNamara. Bmoot then
pitched a foul goal for Maysvtlla and
followed It up a moment later with
field goal. MeNamara then pitched
two more foul goals. Then the slaugh
ter of the Innocent began. The end of
the half showed the score 28 to 5, Ger
mantown's other points being made by
McN'amara on fonla. Tho second half
opi ned with a field goal from Krown
tiiii. The Maysyllle team after reach
ing 50 points allowed the German
townites toicore eleven points mak
ing them 20. This score was maintain
ed until the cloae of the game a few
moments later. Two changes were
made in the second half on the Mays
ville team, Parker taking Downing
place, Browning shifted to Smoot's
place and Parker put In Browning's
(place. All of the scoring waa done
I by four men on the .Maysville team.
jWood getting 14 points, Smoot 14, Ev
jerett 14, and Browning 8. MeNamara
did nearlly all of the scoring for the
.visitors bo getting 16 points, eight of
I which were fouls. All of the Maysville
men played good games but Everett
was the star of the evening with Wood
a close second. Smoot was put out of
the gamo In the second half for natal
Improper language while In play.
The next game will be played on
next Wednesday night when Manches
ter comes to try their luck.

MIKE BROWN
'The Square Deal Man"
"Will they have a Tobacco Fair next
year?" seemed to be the chief question
on the atreeta this morning after sev
ers! hundred people had visited tin
Liberty Warehouse on Commerce
street last night. Those who had at
tended were so well pleased with the
exhibition that they feel that the Fair
was a great thing and that it should
he held every year.
The character of the fair thla year
was more corn than tobacco, although
some few entries were made of tne
latter. The dry weather all fall kel
the tobacco from coming In "case" so
the farmers could strip and bring tho
tobacco in. The winners of the prices
In tobacco were announced this morn
ing and will be published in Monday's
Ledger.
The baby contest was the main at
traction on yesterday afternoon. Twenty-six
babies were entered and Miss
Lois Jean Randolph, daughter of Mr
and Mrs. J. H. Randolph woy first
prize. Master William Maticar Jones.
Jr., son of Prof, and Mrs. W. M. Jones
von the second. The judges certainly
had a hard time picking the wmnerr
as every child present was worthy of
the first price. To each babv in the
contest an envelope containing one
dollar was given with the compliment?
of the Farmers and Planters Ware
house Co. to open a savings accounl
in the State National Bank. The
Judges for the contest were Miss Annie
M. Casey, Mr. A. L. Powers and Mr.
Homer Bills.
The High School Orchentra was
present yesterday afternoon and play
oti a number of selections. This or
chestra la rapidly gaining fame and
under its new directress, Miss Wil
liams, Is rapidly reaching the heights
of musical perfection.
Prizes in all departments except to
bncco were awarded yesterday after
noon. The Germantown band arrived yes
terday morning and spent the day In
the warehouse. Their music drew a
great number of persons and they cer
tainly could play. Their music Is some
of the latest and it could hardly be
excelled by any band.
The crowd last night waa Immense
It seemed as if every citizen of Mays
ville was in the Liberty Warehouse
and certainly there was a very large
percentage of them present. A num
ber of county people were also In at
tendance. The matter was discussed yesterday
of continuing the fair over until next
week but after the consideration of
the matter the managers decided that
this 'would not be done this year.
Savvoy's acrobatic bulldogs were the
attraction of the evening. The dogs
were trained to the last minute and
those in the charge of them had com
plete control over the anlmala. This
attraction held the attention of the
crowd during each performance and
proved a very attractive feature.
Lucaty and Costello again pleased
with their selections on the violin and
accordean.
A portion of the warehouse floor
was blocked off last night and begin
ulng about 9 o'clock dancing was en
joyed by many. The proceeds of the
dance were given to the Mason County
Health League.
Today is expected to be the banner
one of the fair. A large number of
country people are expected and the
big building will be taxed to the
utmost to accommodate those present.
Superintendent T. P. Boone and as
sistants January and Foley are in
charge of all arrangements In regard
to the fair. They are very pleased
with the large crowds and expect at
least 3,000 people present today.
Mcllvain, Knox & Dlener have fitted
up the ladies rest room with a sanitary
couch, settee, rockera and a large mir
ror. They deserve the thanks of the
management very much for this.
