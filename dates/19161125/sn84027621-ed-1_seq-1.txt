BOARD OF TRADE
An Enthusiastic and Well Attended
Meeting Transacted Some Im
portant Business Friday
Evening
At the Board of Trade meeting
Friday evening, there was a good at
tendance of the old standby es, and
some important, matters received con
sideration. Beside President Rogers and Secre
tary Trammell there were in attend
ance, Messrs. J. J. Gejig, , Hibbert
Weathers, George MacKay, D. E. Mc
Iver, J. E. Chace, W. T. Gary, W. N.

michael, H. C. Packham, L. . H. Cha
zal, Eric and Travis Collier, . L. M.
Murray and the Banner and Star re
porters. The most important matters of the
evening were regarding the new spin
ning mill, the Silver Springs to Ocala
canal and the connection with the
Tampa and Jacksonville railroad.
The promoters of the mill want
Ocala people to take stock in the en
terprise to the amount of $5000, which
the. board of tradeconsidered a very
reasonable request. A committee con
sisting of Messrs. Chace, Gary and
Benjamin was selected to draw up
suitable resolutions in regard to the
matter. ' , .
There .was considerable discussion
in regard to the canal. All present
except Carmichael favored the work.
Mr. Carmichael Jbased his' opposition
on the fear that a canal might TharmJ
if not destroy the natural beauty of
the springs and would be almost cer
tain to destroy that of the river. It
was decided that the board would do
all in its power to push the work, and
a committee consisting of President
Rogers, Messrs.; Gerig, Martin and
Gary was appointed to confer with
Congressman dark and Major Ladue
when they ,visit"the city' in a few days.
" The. matter of Connecting with the
Tampa rand Jacksonville railroad also
met with the warm approval of the
board. A committee was appointed
to confer with the managers of the
road. It was composed, of the same
members who had charge of the mat
ter when the proposition was' ad
vanced ' by the little road some time
ago,- namely Messrs. Chambliss, Ed
wards, Meffert, Ditto and Trammell.

Billion and a Quarter a Year to
. Enable Them to Keep"
- Up
(Associated Press)
Washington, Nov. 25. Railroads
will need $1,250,000,000 additional
capital for the next ten xr twelve
years to increase their facilities to
handle the country's grpwing com
merce, Alfred P. Thom, counsel for
the railway executive advisory com
mittee, told the congressional railroad
investigation committee yesterday.
About $250,000,000 a year additional
will be required, he said,. to refund
maturing indebtedness. .
To attract investors, Mr. Thorn sug
gested that federal regulation should
replace the present system of author
ity divided between the states and the
central government.
"It has been found," said Mr. Thom,
"that the wealth of the country has
been increasing at the race of 8 or 9
per cent a year and the same ratio of
increase has held good as to the de
mand for transportation. As the
forces which have affected the growth
and development of the past appar
ently still continue ia full operation,
and may reasonably be expected to
continue for thertext .ten or 'fifteen
years, at least, the investment in
railroad facilitie sto meet the large
requirements of the future must con
sequently grow at a 'corresponding
annual rate of increase." .
"The estimate of $1,250,000,000 for
additional transportation facilities in
clude nothing for extensions into new
territory," he added
"Where is this money or any sum
approximating it . to ' " come from ? "
asked Mr;? .Tnpm.;?s:tir;problei' is
"one'of vital interest to; the public be
cause ' on - its -".successful -solution de
pends the commercial facilities, of the
country. Would it do to confront the
investor, when asking for this great
investment, with a situation where
the revenues of the railroads are not
subject to the control of the investors,
but are fixed and limited not only by
governmental authority, but by many
uncordiriated state authorities in no
wayresponsible to each other, and
where the railroads cannot control
and the government cannot and does
not limit the expense account?'
THE CAMPAIGN
SCANDAL-MONGER
A look, a gentureand a sneer, a fool
on mischief bent, '
And then upon 'their darksome ways
his words of scandal went:
Perhaps the one who turned them loose
would fain now check their
course,
But they have sped afar to - scatter
hatred, sorrow and remorse.
He knew it was a coward's act, a mon-
' strous thing to do, '
And never can he head it off so swift
the scandal flew. A
A multitude may start horrid
wrath to tame:
The spotless page of fellowship will
never be the same.
He fought the truth; now tries to kill
the lies, forsooth:
But always will they live, and e'en
assume the guise of truth.
The scandal keeps its hurtling way
- with venom in its darts:
Oh, 'twas an easy devil's work to send
those words upon the track.
But now they've gone, no power on
earth can ever call thenviack.
They grow more lusty ever hour oh,
had he never heard
That men must give account to God
for every spoken work 7

BANDIT!! RESERVED
In the Agreement which has Almost
Been Reached by Americans
and Mexicans
' (Associated Press)
Atlantic City, N. J.,- Nov. 25.
Withdrawal of American' troops who
went into Mexico in pursuit of Fran
cisco Villa, after the Columbus raid,
and the patrolling of the border by
the respective armies of the United
States and Mexico, was agreed to in a
protocol signed here late yesterday
by the members of the American
Mexican joint commission seeking to
adjust differences between the two
countries. Adjournment of the con
ference sessions was taken , immed
iately to allow Alberto J. Pani, one
of the Mexican commissioners, to go
to Mexico to place the proposals be
fore First Chief Carranza for his ap
proval. ;
The plan characterized by Secre
tary of the Interior Lane, chairman
of the . American commission, as the
beginning of a policy ' which will
"make a Mexico that we can live
with," provides that General Pershing
shall bring his men across the line
within forty days after the protocol
is finally approved by the two govern
ments, unless by that time the condi
tions in . Northern Mexico have be
come such that the American border

monition is contained: in ; a separate
document, nowever, that the United
States reserves the right -to pursue

Argues that Regulation of Railroads
Except in Entirely Local Matters
Should be Office tf Federal
Government Only -
(Associated Press)
Washington, D. C, Nov. 25. Ex
clusive federal regulation, except in
matters so essentially local as not to
interfere with the efficiency of service
or just rights of the carriers, with a
system . of federal incorporation of
railroads was urged by Alfred, F.
Thom, counsel for the railway execu
tives' advisory oemmittee at the hear
ing of the congressional investigating
committee today.
Mr. Thom was outlining some of the
principles which the railroads believed
should be included in any just system
of regulation. He urged the reorgani
zation of the Interstate Commerce
commission and the creation of a new
federal railroad commission and a re
gional commission subordinate to it.
He argued that exclusive federal con
trol would not invade the principle of
state's rights.
question of co-operation on the border
is left to the commanding officers of
the two armies there.

BELL RUN
ACROSS MICHIGAN
Record Breaking Trip of Sturdy Little
Car Carrying Election
Returns
In -the face of impossible road con
ditions a stock Maxwell tourini? car
driven by Ray McNamara established
remarkable record the day. follow
ing election day,, when it pounded its
Tway across Michigan, from Detroit to
Kalamazoo and return, in 9 hours and
45 minutes. The speedometer regis
tered 350 miles when the car was
checked in at Detroit at the conclus
ion of the run. The average speed
was 35.9 miles per hour.
The route taken follows: Detroit to
Lansing, Lansing to Grand Rapids,
Grand Rapids to Kalamazoo. Kalama
zoo to Battle Creek, Battle Creek to
Jackson,1 Jackson to Detroit The run
was officially observed and checked by
Detroit newspaper men.
Carried Election News
No mechanical trouble was encoun
tered, despite the fact that the car
endured a terrific pounding on long
stretches of rough road. The only
stop made on the long trin was at
Kalamazoo, where gasoline and oil
were taken on.
Besides establishing a remarkable
record for speed and efficiency, the
Maxwell car took on itself the duties
of a courier, carrying news of the elec
tion results to the rural districts of
Michigan. -
More than 50 per cent of the road
was in the worst possible shape for
touring. There were deep ruts,
stretches of sand and long stretches of
fresh gravel. In several places it was
necessary to take long detours because
of construction work. In view of thes&
adverse conditions it is believed the
record made by McNamara and his
Maxwell will endure. '
The start was made from Detroit at
15 a. m. and the car was checked
into Detroit at 1 p. m., just 9 hours
and 45 minutes after the run started.
