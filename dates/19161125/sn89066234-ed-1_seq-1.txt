North Dakota Farmers Organize and
Capture State Government.
Fargo, N. I) Nov.lB, Tlw
era' Nonpartisan league of
farm-tgue,
North
Dakota in the recent elections
captured completely and i, enor
mous: majorities the legislative,
executive and Judicial branches
vf the state government.
The league elected nearly 100
members of the legialature, some
of them on the Republican, some
on the Democratic ami some on
the Socialist ticket.
The league's candidate for gov
"i nor. Lynn J, Krasler, a Repub
lican and a farmer, was elected
or pfibOOO majority while at the
same time, Wilson carried the
-tute for president.
The league took no part In this
selection on the candidates for
preside nt, United States house of
representatives nor the L'nite.l
states senate,
Most of the league's candidates
for the state ticket were on the
ltepubliean ticket. Tlteir candi
date for state treasurer was run
on tlie Democratic ticket and
while lie lolled about ."0.000
votes, it will require the official
count to determine the result,
The league'! three candidates
for tlie supreme court, which
gives them the majority or the
court, were elected by from 10.
1)00 to 12,000 majority,
about 80 of the league's candi
dates elected to the legislature
;ire Socialists although most of
them were run as Democrats or
Republicans, but all farmers.
In the primary Inst .June, many
Socialists and Democrats regis
tered as republicans for nt rage tie
leasons, since North Dakota Iris
an election law, thanks to the
master-class, that requires voters
to tell the tax assessors their po
litical aflllatlons.
A complete nonpartisas ballot
law will be one of the first acts
of the Incoming legislature.

The legislative program of the
Farmers' Nonpartisan League
upon Which it organized the
farmers and With which they
were completely victorious in the
primaries and in the recent elect
ions is as follows:
stute-ow ned terminal elevators,
flour mills, stock yards, packing
houses, and cold storage plants.
State hail insurance.
state Inspection of dockage and
grading ol grain.
Exemption of farm improve
ments from taxation,
Stutc rural credit banks to be
operated at cost.
The new! elected legislature
will have the power to deulfavor
abl.v with this program, part of
the items b.v eoiislitution.il ac
tion and part b direct legisla
tive action.
The Farmers' .Nonpartisan lea
gue began to organize earl In
1015, as a result of the hostile
action or the previous legislatures

marketing and conversion of farm
products.

Kussell s most eiiective worn in

and the effectiveness of his mas- I

reflected in the treatment the
farmers later accorded the rep

North Dakota papers when they
opened up their campaign or lies

discovered somewhat the size and
character of the movement, there
was launched the most bitter
newspaper campaign against the
league, that ever arose in the

The "kept press, my; and lit

But it was not long before many
of them fell by the wayside.
They awoke to find a dwindling

The farmers were warned that

league was Socialism pure and!

cancellation of subscriptions, thai

THK COAL HOWL IS HEARD,
Like the jicople of every other
section or the country, Cape Dir-
Olrardeau and Jackson are howl
ing about tlie BOarctty of coal,
pad tlie consequent high price.
Tlie reason given by the kept
press is 'car shortage. Hut it Is
the business of the kept press to
keep the people on a blind trail
The railroad owners also own tlie
coal mines. How could "car
shoetage" increase the price at
the mines ?
Last week John St ike of New
Hamburg was here to buy coal,
and was told that the price was
S5.B0. He went to the Mar
shall store at the Station to see
If he could do better. They had
sold out, but a car was expected.
Knowing that the kept press had
been telling US that the high cost
was due to ear shortage, I asked i
Mr. Ferguson, the manai
store, the d if fere nee In
the mines two months
er of the
price at
ago ami I
now.
Two months ago the price nt
the mines was $1,30 per ton," he
answered. "We are unable to get
prices now. The last limitations
we had was about three weeks
ago at $22.60, Now we just have
to order and pn, what Is asked. "
is ear shortage responsible for
this? And if there is a ear short
age, whose fault is it'.' Have the
lailroad managers been so bus.v
looting their roads and placing
them in the hands or receivers
that they forgot to build cars?
Never were the railroads more u
ble to build. Their own reports
to the Inter-state commerce com
mission show their earnings to be
greater than ever before over
95,000 per mile for the past 1
montli '.
How coul i the anarchism In tin
present order of sOCiet be more
foldbl illustrated V A few
greedj gluttons are permitted to
control the fuel supply of a w hole
nation. The also own the way
OUt the railroads. And the peo
ple must paj the tribute deman

our modern pirates who operate
under the law. Capt, Kldd and
the kind we used to hunt down a

if this is Christianity, the qulckci
We get rid of it. the better. But
it is not. It is the devil's own
state or society, and is being up
held by self-styled Christians.
Commenting on this situation
I the Jackson correspondent to till
Cape Republican says that o

ings. enough fuel is being vvnstc
fully burned to keep Jackson It lid

I greatest evils of the present ordei

that the people need is beiiijj
j wasted ill the woods because it
i will not "paj to transport it to
the
people who ate suffering for
it. in tlie absence of profit peo
ple call freeze, and society is not
the least concerned.
Exactly the same condition is
responsible for thousands of car
loads or melons rotting in the
rioids or Scott county ever year.
The poor ol the cities want these
melons, and the producers would
be glad to sell them at a little
more tl.au the cost of loading, b lit
the railroads and commission men
are between the producer and the
consumer, and the melons rot in
the fields. And both the produc
er and Consumer vote Tor this.
How foolish it is for a nation
or supposedly sane people to per
mit a very few to control that
which is necessary to their Vftrj
existence! No savage tribe was
ever so foolish. So long as there
is rood among the tribe, no child
goes hungry. If We cannot
change these conditions, let's
grow hairy and return to savage
ry. By-the-way, Rube, why is it

Factionalism Is the (res lit ol

by one interest. In such a com

results from it. are the founda

place in any Christian communi
ty, yet there is HO getting rid of
it SO long as capitalism endures.
In the north end of Scott coun
ty the Mississippi river Is bridged.
As soon as it became known that
a bridge would lie built, options
were taken on land by rival capi
talists. This laud was platted
into lots some by the original
owners, and some hy foreign cap
italists who came In.
Three towns were platted -to
say nothing or various additions,
and the rivalry began- for profit.
At first the population was ver
small and each town wanted the
postoffioe, Each town wanted
the dejot. the round-house, and
