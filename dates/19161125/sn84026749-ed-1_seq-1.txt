Concerted Assault Begun by

CRUCIAL STAGE IN BATTLE
Nothing Yet Received to Show
How Third Day of Con-
fliot Is Going.
Eli PASO, Nov. 28. A concerted as
sault waa begun.upon Chihuahua City
from three aide ahortly after day
light today by the VllllsU bandits, c
cording to a report reaching Govern
ment agents here today.
Coniul General Garcia said he had
not yet reculved a menage' reporting
the actual beginning of the third
daya battle between the bandlta and
Carrantlatas.
Crucial Stajre Rcachta1.
Reports reaching Government agenta
here Indicated that the crucial atage
In the battle for possession of Chi
huahua City had bean reached today.
In an attempt to force General Tre
vino, commanding the garrlaon, to ex
haunt hla ammunition supply, aamll
raiding parties of Vllllstaa moved
upon advanced trenches of the de
fenders during the night to draw
tbelr rifle Arc. ,
Military men here todar exnected
Villa to make a desperate assault
upon the northern Moxlcan capital.
Most Silence naileries.
The 'aTlendng of batteries upon
Santa, Tlosa hill, commanding every
part of the city, Is necessary before

can become tenable for the attaching
forces.
The shortage of rifle ammunition

Titcto military authorltca at Juarra.
One carload of artllery shells Is being
held In the yards there, but General
Trovlno, fearlrtg It would fall Into the
hands of the bandits, wired "We have
plenty of shells, don't send yet."
Despite announcements by Car
rnnxlnta officers that Villa was flee
Ing In disorder, following yesterday's

sources that the bandit chief with his
followers had encamped just outsiae

Unless re-enforecments reach General
Trevlno from the south. United Mates
authorities here believe he cannot hold
out much longer against the bandit at

been cautious and upparently with tho
bject of drawing as much flro as

to lay virtual siege to the city until

Andrea Garcia, consul Inspector gen

MEXICO PACT TO WILSON
Presldont Expected to Qlve Prompt
Approval to Agreemnt.
Franklin K. Lane, Secretary of the
Interior and chairman of the Amer
.can section, of tho Mexican Com
mission, la expected to lay before
President Wilson sometime this
evening or tomorrow tho draft of
he protocol signed at Atlantlo City
csterday by the Mexican and Atner-
un commissioners.
There Is every Indication that
'resident Wilson will promptly ap
prove It.
Prospects Siot Urlubt.
The prospects are by no means as
piomlslng regarding General, Car
innza. To what extent a failure on
t'arranza'a part to agree will result
In a more drastic policy by this Gov.
irnment will depend on future opera
,lons of the Vllllsta bandits.
There Is every Indication that Presi
dent Wilson la determined to defend
die American border from further
i aids and that he la prepared to tako
vigorous measures to that end If Car
ransa sefuses to do his part.
Of prlmury Interest to the dltlxens
of Washington Is the fact that If the
protocol Is signed the members of the
.District national guard, nowon the
border, will probably oat their dinner
Christmas Day at home.
The protocol provides that within
forty dnyH after tho agreement In
signed General Pershing shall with
draw his forces from Mexico.
And according to the plans of the
Wnr Department, as the regulars ure
wlthdrnwn from ncros stho line and
mude uvallnblo for patrol duty, the
inllltla contingents will bo sent back
to their home States.
PRESIDENT NURSES COLD
Forced to Abandon' Trip to See the'
Army-Navy Game.
Forced by his physician and Mrs.
Wilson to abandon his plan to attend
tho Army-Navv football game today,
President Wilson remained In the
White House today nursing his cold.
Ho remained In bed until 10 o'clock,
but wan ablo to wor kon State- paporx
Hi his study during the remainder of
the day. ,
Although It Is stated that tho cold
Is by no means serious, the fact that
the bronchial tubes were slightly af
fected persuaded the President to
yield to pressure and not run the risk
of sitting for several hours In an
Open staid.
When It was found that he would
not go, all the members of the Presi
dent's party gave up the Idea of at
tending the game.

A. F. OF L DEFERS ACTION
Puts 8'Hour Issue Over to Spare
President Embarrassment.
BALTIMORE, Nov. JG. Tho Ameri
can Federation of Labor today refused
to go on record against efforts to ob
tain the eight-hour day by 'legislation.
Instead, the federation put the Issue
over for another year, during which a
special committee will confer with
transportation workers' organisations.
Desire not to embarrass President Wil
son because of hla work In forcing an
eight-hour day law for railroad men,
was the apparent cause for the con
vention' action.
"Wo're up against a situation," de-.
clarod Mayor-elect Thomas van Lear, of
Minneapolis, representative of the ma
chjlsltaf union, "whero a President of
the united States has sensed the senti
ment of labor better than our own or
fanlsatlon has In tho post two conven
iens." lie referred to tho fact that the two
conventions havo gone on record against
efforts to obtain tho shorter working
day by legislation.
There was little discussion. The vote
was 158 to S3 for deferring action one

deported for employment In German
factories, it is explained uiat If by

because Belgian authorities have
failed to furnish German oMclala with
proper lists of those unemployed. The
German government. It is asserted,
has taken "responsible measures" to
return those Ilelglans erroneously de
ported. The Cologne Gazette 'denies that
Belgians deported from their country

that a system or adequate national
defense mfght be properly, developed.

"We must be efficient aa a nation

"and we must appreciate that efficient

to halt and weaken our transporta.

permanent Imposition of burdens, by
unwise regulation, we will make na

"Is It wise," he asked, "for tia to
subject a matter of such universal
concern and such great national Im

and Inadequate outlook of the States?
The progress of events and the
growth of the nation emphasise the
wisdom and necessity of reposing

"It would furnish a surer basis for

a matter of nation-wide consequence
than could be placed In the varying
Judgment or different local authori
ties, but It will be necessary to go
much further than merely simplify,
ing and concentrating regulation. It
will be necessary to Introduce Into
the system of regulation by the Ni
tlonal Government those elements of
consiruciiveness ana helpfulness
which are essential to the continued
growth and efficiency of the Inatru

State Department Pondera Over

The State Department Is giving con

from the Belgian government ror In
tercession by the United States to end
the deportation or Belgians for forced

E. Havenlth, the Belgian minister,
acting under Instruction from his
government, presented a supplemental
request to the United States Govern
ment that It "urge the German gov
ernment to consider he consequences
of the crimes against humanity com
mitted In their name."
The Stbte Department haa received
preliminary reports rrom American
Charge Orew at Berlin on his efforts
as Belgian representative to present
the deportation question to the Ger
