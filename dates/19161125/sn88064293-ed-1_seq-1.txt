OUR NAVAL SCHOOLS

$
We had a military academy almost
half a century before we had a naval
academy. It was not until the admin
ation of President James K. Polk
that the government thought it nec
essary to establish a naval academy
at which young men could be educa
ted for that part of their protective
service.
George Bancroft was the founder
of the United States naval Academy
school. It was formally opened at
Annapolis on October 10, 1845. For

several years" prior to this
there was a school working along
similar lines at the Naval asylum in
Philadelphia, where the midshipmen
prepared themselves for examination
|and promotion.
The school was recognized in 1850
and the course was increased from
five to seven, the first and last two
years to be passed at the school, the
intervening years at sea. At this
time the separate departments of
instruction were established, a vessel
was provided and annual practice
cruises were instituted. In 1851 the
requirements of sea service were
abolished, leaving the course four
consecutive years of study.
At the outbreak of the war in
1861 the Naval Academy was re
moved to Newport, R. I., where it
j remained until the summer of 1865,
;when it was established at Annapo
1 lis. In 1870 the title of cadet mid
; shipman, was substituted for mirl
; shipman, aftd three years later the
I course was increased by the addition I
; of two years' sea service in cruising
j vessels, at the expiration of which |
the
cadet midshipman returned to the \
I Naval Academy for examination in
j professional subjects prior to grad
j uation.
j Previous to the establishing of the
I Naval Academy several attempts had
; been made to establish training
j schools for officers and sailors of the
; navy. In 1838 Captain M. C. Perry
suggested a school for engineers,
j but little was accomplished before
I Bancroft called the meeting in Phila
; delphia which decided the establish
| ing of the present school.
I At first there was considerable of
a wrangle as to where the school
should be located. The site finally j
chosen was an old army post known i
as Fort Severn, located on the point 1
of land which forms the easternmost
extremity of the city of Annapolis !
{'and lies between the harbor and the
; Severn river. Poor as the place was
j j in tl\y eyes of Bancroft, he saw that
i is was far less likely to challenge
f congressional criticism than
more
1 , pretentious habitation, and besides,
as the board of naval officers had
sa 'd, the fact was undeniably true
that it might "be enlarged and per
fected at some future time."
Fort Severn was duly transferred
by the war department to the navy
to on August 15, 1845, and a fortnight
di
afterward Secretary Bancroft pub
lished his "plan" subsequently pre
pared by Commander Buchanan,
governing the workings of the school
until 1850. The first superintendent
of the Naval Academy was com

Oct. 10, 1845, all hands assembled in
one of the recitation rooms, and the
superintendent, after a brief pointed
address, in which he announced he
should exact rigid compliance with
all laws, orders and regulations, de
clared the schools open. The old
buildings at the »••my post at Anna
polis, where the midshipmen began
to receive instruction, had been
termed by Secretary Bancroft "a
modest shelter for the pupils," and
it is said that they certainly deserved
no more complimentary description.
Mr. Bancroft at once began plans
to have the academy more com
moc h° us ly housed, and he asked eon
press for an appropriation of $28,

|
OOOMo be expended for repairs, im
provements and instructions at Fort
Severn, Annapolis. The secretary
brought all his diplomacy and skill
to bear, and at last had the profound ;
satisfaction of receiving the appro-1
priation by an ample majority and
of seeing the naval school of the
United States then become duly or
ganized by law.
Thus ended the long fight for it.
Three days after the bill became a
law Secretary Bancroft directed the
superintendent to enlarge the build
ings and construct new ones suffi
cient to accommodate 100 shipmen.
This small beginning was the founda
tion of the present large and effec
tive institution, which trains the
sailors in a way eqüal to that fur
nished by any other country in the
world.—Philadelphia Press.
