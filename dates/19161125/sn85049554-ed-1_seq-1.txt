irrr-v".v Mrs. Tompkins Again.
.'J-. C-'.-^fo*® going into his story leading
t6 the arrest of Mansfield, "Wilkerson
told the tale which he said Mrs. Vina
Tompkins hwl told bim of the "slaugh
ter boose plov' which she said she over
heard on the Middle Nodaway in the
it
11 of iUl.
This brought out, n6thing new except
'that Mrs Tompkins told blm that her
brother. Harry Whipple, who was
camping with them at the time, had
refused to go to work and when shrf
threatened to make him get out of the
6amp' he had replied, "I don't have to
work, pet a job croakln' a man/! An
objection from counsel for the plaintiff
resulted in thisj*elng stricken from the
-records.
Wilkerson also related the circum
stances of how B- H. Thorp had told
him what be said occurred on the train
going from Clarlnda to New Market on
.pthe morning of the discovery of the
7 murder, which Thorp has already testi
fled to in the present trial. Wilkerson
said Thorp tolds.him this striry in the
oourt bouse here at the time of the
trand jury, session last summer.
Now Point Brought Out.
J^bnother story, which has not been
'testified to in- evidence, Wilkerson told
)of securing from Mnr. Luke Smith, a
resident of Villisca at the time of the
murder. T^e detective said that Mrs.
Smith bad told bim in Saskatchewan,
Canada, that on the night oif the mur
der she had been unable to sleep and
while sitting in the window of her
^-home, facing (h» ynhool hptise square,
#Ue bad seen £nd heard an automobile
ilTO»lwJw^TOi^!
dvlve slowly around the block twice
that when it reached, the corner of the
Moore home it bad stopped and then
started rapidly north.
The detective then went on to tell
how he had learned of the incident
which occurred in a garage In Villisca
on the Suniilay night of the murder, as
has already been testified to by E. M.
Nelson Wow he had traced the early
morning automobile trip taken by W.
B. MbG&ull and Albert Jonee on the
Monday morning following the murder.
In telling of this latter fact. Wilkerson
told of a conversation he said he had
with Albert Jones in a room in th«
Fisher hotel ijv Villisca. which was re
corded by a stenographer at one end o(
a dictaphone^ Installed In the room.
Wilkerson said that In this conversa
tion hte had inquired qf Albert Jones
about his early morning trip and said
that Jones admitted making the trip
with McCaull, saying they had gone
out to Jim klmmel's to spll Ira .Sickler,
who worked ith^re, a buggy. Accord
ing to Wllkerson'a testimony Jones told
him then that -they left Villisca be
tween 7 and 7:30 o'clock In the morn
ing. Wilkerson also testified that he
had had a similar conversation with
McCaull at Missouri Valley about the
piece of Joe Mobre's skull.. MoCaull IS
alleged to have been exhibiting. Mc
Caull denied this, he said.
"Well, if the auto trip is all I had to
explain, I'd be all right", is a, remark
attributed to Albert Jones by Wilker
son in the conversation in the Fisher
hotel room.
Goss Into Detail.
From this point on Wllkerson'a tes
timony became a lengthy and detailed
account of the steps leading to the ar
rest of William Mansfield, practically
ail of which was given wide publicity
at the time Mansfield was brought to
Red Oak for a hearing before the
grand jury." Included In this was a re
cital of the all-night grilling which he,
with police officials, had given Mafia
deld at the time of his arrest Much of
this was what appeared to be a verba
tim account of the dialogue which
passed between hjmself and Mansfield
at this all-night examination, Wilker
son repeating word for word the ques
tions put to Mansfield and the latter's
answerNwith no explanatory remarks
interwoven.
Mansfield Gets Money.
In tellfng of the arrangements made
for Mansfield's extradition to Iowa,
Wilkerson started to explain that
Mansfield was suddenly possessed of
financial backing which seemed to
Theck him at every turn, but the court
sustained objections made to these
statements.
At the outset of Wllkerson'a testi
mony objections were frequent from
counsel for the plaintiff but practically
all were overruled. At one time Attor
ney 'Beeson Interposed an objection to
what he called the "stump speech"
Wilkerson was making and contended
that more. Questions ought to be asked
by Wllkerson'a counsel in the examin
ation. He was not sustained, howev^f.
Beeson also charged there was a co
terie in the court room, trained to
laugh, when exchanges between hlm
s6!f and Attorney Mitcbell became
warm across the counsel' table, and
Judge Rockafellow was again jmoved
to admonish ctb£ audience against any
manifestations at apjfroyal.
'fA&W
be finisR^d before Thanksgiving day
asjMCKrMtehd^&KW^t^• the following
Meek. Much rebuttal testimony will
probably be introduced on behalf of
Senator Jones to contradict that offer
ed by the. defendant.

LAUNCH CRUSHED

Boat Carrying Fifty Men From Supply
Ship Glacier -Is Run Down by River
8teamer Apache—One Man Known
to Have Perished^
i" ...
San Francisco, Nov. S6.—Four United
States sailors met death here today,
and half a score were Injured when a
launch carrying thirty-five men of the
supply ship Glacier's crew was swept
under the paddle t^des of the stern
wheel river steamer Apache.-
San Francisco, Nov. 23-rA launch
carrying: fifty ro&nza to the nayaKsup
piy sKp''^'Glaciefu was 'lwserturrieajhere
today by the river steamer. Apaone.
One man is- known to have been
drowned. A roll call will be necessary
to determine liovV many, if any more,
were lost.
The launch, putting off, crowded
with men returning from shore leave,
was swept by the tide under the stern
wheel of the Apache. The big steel
blade sheared off the stem of the
launch, which sank immediately.
Aboard the Glacier It was said six
men at least were hot accounted for at
first muster, but these might still be
ashore.
The Injured are William Heiberger,
chief machinist's mate, Glendale, Cal.:
Internally hurt and half drowned.
Fred Wrights seaman, Renton, Wash.:
internally hurt.
A fleet of small boats was rushed to
the scene and began picking up men.
The United States cruiser South Da
kota, at anchor on Man-o'-War row,
a mile away, rushed her launches to
the rescue and picked up the first body.
The accident occurred almost in the
path of the trans-bay ferry boats,
bringing thousands of commuters to
San Francisco from Oakland, Berkeley,
and Alameda. To the fact these crafts
were so r.car at hand was attributed
the remarkably small loss of life, as
contrasted with an upset In New York
harbor some years ago.
Seaman Wright, at the hospital, said
several men were under the launch
canopy.
"I don't know whether they got out
or not," he said. "It was all over in
a moment."
Roberts, the coxswjaln, did every
thing any man could do to avert the
catastrophe. Wright declared.
"He tried to 'swing the launch
around, but we were too close and the
suction was too strong," he said. "No
body could have averted the collision."
The man officially in charge of the
launch was Boatswain F. C. Nigg.
Lieut. Frank B. Freyer is in command
of the Glacier.
The launch in charge of, Bob Roberts,
coxswain, put out from the ship be
tween piers 14 and lfi. At pier 14 lay
ntival water barge 25. At pier 16 was
the Apache, just docking The space
was small, but Roberts considered it
ample and headed the launoh midway
between the two big boats.
As the launch ran out*from the pro
tecting piers the tide caught it and
swept It against the stern of the river
steamer. The Apache's wheel was re
versed and revolving slowly. Before
Roberts could twist his wheel the
launch was directly under the great
steel blade.
