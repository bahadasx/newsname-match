EDGAR GOING
TO SERVICES!
BY EDGAR C. WHEELER
I'm going to church tumor row I
H's not became my next door neighbor lias been trying to
get me to go to chttreh ever since I landed next door to him.
(James A. J lavs is his name —perhaps he's been after you to
take out some everlasting life insurance, too.)
To be a truth-telling reporter. I'll have to admit, too, that
it's in* liecause of any particular hankering I have for the
alarm dock, I stiff collar and «'i boiled shirt on the day of rest,
Sunday newspapers and the big arm chair.
It's because I have to go. The editor said I had to, and
that's all there is to it.
(But before 1 go any further I feel it my duty to make it
plain again that 1 am not the Rev. Edgar C. Wheeler of Tao
ma-and Sylvan. I lis middle name is Couch and mine isn't,
though I admire the name yery much, especially 00 a Sunday
morning. The poor man has heen blamed fur enough low
brow stuff without slinging this on him too.)
/ HE USED TO HAVE TO GO
Funny, isn't it, the first recollection 1 have of going to
church is that I had to go!
It's strange also, that it brings a lump in my throat to re
member those bright Sunday mornings when they scrubbed
my neck and put on my best lUit and led me by the hand and
landed me safely, before the old cracked bell stopped tolling,
intu the i>e.v, there to wriggle and nibble licorice drops.
I remember times later on, though, when I didn't always go
to church just because I had to.
Particularly do I remember a face over beyond the other
aisle, which had the habit of turning away and gazing out of
the window whenever I I.Hiked at it.
1 remember it was a face that was always sandwiched in
between dark curls and a freshly ironed fluffy white dress.
Then there was the road to her house, over which she
couldn't possibly have walked alone in safety, even though the
moon might be bright.
WILL HEAR A BAPTIST FIRST
I remember later there was a man in a certain pulpit, a reg
ular feller, too, who could put into words things I felt but
couldn't express, and who could give directions on where to
find some of the things 1 was hunting for.
I think I'll go to the First Baptist church tomorrow. I used
to lie a Baptist once, and Mr. Charles Evans Hughes is one.
Not tbat I have anything against the Presbyterians. I used
to lie a Presbyterian once, too—my folks were the bluest kind
of Presbyterians, and President Wilson is one.
I confess I don't know who the preacher of the First Baptist
church is. All I hope is that he won't be too hard on me and
tell me what a lost soul I am, or give any too vivid picture of
hell burning.
And I do hope all the elders and deacons won't gather in
the vestibule to grip me by the hand and welcome me back into
the fold. I can stand having a few bones broken, but the
other gets my goat.
So when the church bells ring tomorrow, if you look, you'll
see little Edgar in his best bib and tucker, starting out on the
straight and narrow.

lead of H in the first period, Hurry
he Gore, the big Yule mainstay,
came to the front for the Blue,
ripped up the great Crimson de
fense until Neville was pushed
over for the first touchdown for
Yale over a Harvard team in nino
years.
Yale's football standard, drag
ged in the dust for years by Har
vard, was thus pulled back to a
victorious crest.
Yale's score was obtained by
smashing line plungeß by Le Gore.
The Harvard forwards appeared
unable to hold him. Horween had
punted to Vales' 4 7 yard line,
where Yale by trick plays began
to go through the Harvard line.
Five yards were gained on the
first smash. The ball was on
Harvard's 41 yard line.
he Gore then ran 30 yards to
Harvard's 11 yard line. Again
L<e Gore was given the ball and
dashed through for four more
yards. A third smash netted htm
still another four.
The Blue pennants .vaved and
the Harvard team went Into a
conference.
Then Neville smashed through
center for the touchdown.
Yale's touchdown closely fol
lowed what looked like a sure
touchdown for Harvard at the be
ginning of the second period.
On a kick formation Casey was
given the ball and he got away
for a 70-yard run, crossing the
goal line. But the officials re
fused to allow it, claiming a Har
vard player was holding.
Although fighting to the last
ditch in the last two periods,
neither side could get near enough
to the goal posts for another
score and the game ended with
the fighting Yale eleven the win

WOMAN IN THE
CASE PROTESTS
HER INNOCENCE
tWomoaaaee HMmvHw keeeeteMemi
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Nov. ..;.—"The woman in the case"
the woman thrnst into the McDaniel case by the charges </
my character to pie.es; they say cruel things about me. One
innocent woman has been murdered; another woman's life is
being ruined by suspicion and slander.
Xn one fills mure deeply than 1 ab'.ut this terrible tragedy.
I knew flattie Muss—Mrs. McDaniel —since our high school
days. We were chums then and confidants. We were chums
and confidants at the time of her death last July.
After we both married we were neighbors; our children
played together. My little Margaret and her daughter Helen
share the same seats in school today. Our husbands are
friend:-, and brother h'.lks and brother Shriners.
We were together almost every daw We belonged to thd .
same clubs; we shared the same pleasure.
Ilattie Moss was the most straight forward, courageous
woman I ever knew. She would not pretend friendship forme
if she was not my friend.
Now they say she was jealous of me that I had wrecked
her home; they link my name everyday with this tragedy.
I am innocent!
In the name of my baby girl, I am innocent of wronging my
friend!
