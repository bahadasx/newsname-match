Death of Mrs. Elie Oub'e.
The sad death of Mrs. Elie Oubre
,n e Grassla Dufresne) aged 43
vcars at her home in St. James
,arish on Motnday afternoon at
2 o'clock has brought sorrow to
1l who knew her.
Her death was not unexpected
is she had been sinking gradually
f,)r several weeks.
-he lived a consecrated Christian
ife and died a triumphant death
after having received the last bles
-.n~a and all the consolations of
he Catholic faith to which she
was an ardeit adherent
She was a charitable, and true
friend, a loving wife and kind
.norther, and her devotion to those
.he loved would m.ke a bright
h.<<,tur in any life. Nothing but
die thought of the lovin;g hand
that h'ar removed her can reconcile
'e b.reavcd ores to her absence.
\\1,ile she has gone from the
pcenes, the conflicts, the s,rrows
,nd pleasures of life, she will
mill livein the-hearts of those
who knew her.
Life will never be quite the
.ame to those who knew her,
while those who were nearest to
ner 'will long for her with unut
terable longing- long for a mth
,.r's counsel and advice, and a
-ife's gentle and loving sympa
tiy.
Besides a grief-stricken hus
band she leaves nine children, a
devoted mother, two brothers,
ind seven sisters to mourn her,
sad and untimely death.
Le 1eschacebe proffers its ex
pre-sionof condolence to all thei
oereaved ones, especially to those
~ho now miss a mother's care,
and caresses and to him who
uIw mourns earth's greatest 1
A Beautiful Dance.
No prettier or more enjoyable
function has ever ba.n known
in .this 'communiy than the
I dance giver in the Bertheiot
School, at Lucy, Ls., last Satur
day night for the benefit of the
schooL
The hall was beautifully de
corated with a profusion of
palms, mosses, .pot plants, Ameri
can fla's and other articles of
,embellishment, and the scene
was indeed an attractive one as
the large throng of young peo
ble moved through the stately
measures of the hesitation, or
the livelier evolutions of the
one-step and other Terpsichore
an diversions, to the exquisite
strains of the music soably ren
dered by the celebrated Lutcher
Band.
Among the guests were many
visitors from butcher, Garyville
Gramercy, La?lace, Reserve,
Iand in point of attendance, as
well as in every other particular
the affair was an unquajifled
success.
Prof. W. S. Frazee, Jr., atnd
his two amiable assistants Misses
Myrtle Mauberret, and Blanche
McClintock, together with the
-good people of the community
have every reason to feel distinct.
-ly gratified over the felicitious
outcowmeof their efforts as social
entertainers.
