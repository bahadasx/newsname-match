GROWERS TO DISCUSS
MARKETING OF GOP.N
Louisiana Association's Meet
ing Here Dec. 22 to Take
Up Betterment Problems.
The marketing of Louisiana
coru will hi he main topic of dis
cussiou at the oonvennon of. the
Louisiana Com Growers' Associa
lion to he held at New Orleans
December 22
This announcement was made
at a meeting of a special commit,
tee of the agriculture ami realty
department of the Association of
Commerce Monday, under whose
auspices the New Orleans meeting
of the emu growers will be held.
The deeiie on the part of the
Coru growers to develop markets
for theii product is because of the
fact that the corn production of
L uisiaua is rapidly increasing
and it has been predicted that
within a few years the crop will
total two hundred millions ot bush
eis. This year's crop has been es
tiinated at forty millions of bush
els, the largest crop in the history
of the state of Louisiana.
While New Orleans is said to
offer a good market for Louisiana
corn at good prices, all of the coru
raised in this state is not shipped
as this port. Many of the farmers
do not slun k their own corn, but
merely seU it on the cob to dealers
ui Texas and other states at a low
price. Grain men point out that
it ;he faiine.s would ship their
corn to New Orleans already hull
ed the grower s would realize more
profit than by shipping it to other
points.
The corn growers will be given
a ride over tiie harbor, a luncheon
and will visu the standardization
laboratory of the United States
government during their stay in
New Orleans.
Professor A. S Kidder, of
Baton Kouge, is the secretary of
the Corn Growers' Association,
aud A R. Doseubury, chairman;
E. O Wild, J. F. Denechaud, K
G. Miller, H J. Seiferth, E P.

THE OIL PROSPECTS.
This week opened with an in
cieased interest in the oil pros
pects. It is one of the leading
topics of conversation with all
classes of the people.
There are inauy of our people
who have grown optimistic and
not only foresee the fiudiug of oil
in paying quantities, but a great
era of prosperity coming to this
town aud section in consequence.
The Teche-Grand Lake canal is
spoken of as a double certainty
now. All of the many advantages
heretofore claimed for such a
route for a canal are reiterated
with emphasis, aud a new claim is
made, that such a canal could be
made to pass through the "oil
Held".
A visit to the prospective terri
tory last Sunday revealed the fact
that scouting parties had pretty
thoroughly covered the territory
for "indications". A number of
holes, G or 8 inches in diameter,
were found scattered through that
section, which holes had evideutly
been made to a depth of about 6
feet with a post hole augur.
There were indications which
prompted the belief that the pros
pectors attempted to accumulate
gas in these holes. With what
degree of success, is not known.
If oil is found in paying quanti
ties m this section, it will be like
finding a nest of fresh eggs in the
market. The Teche offers a mar
ket of a hundred miles m extent,
which in its present condition,
would consume the output of a
well of no mean proportions Pa
per pulp mills, with the New Ibe
rio Paper Mill serving as a "pace
fiuder," would consume all of the
cane bagasse from the Teche su
gar houses, thne assuring greater
demand for a more economically
handled fuel. Should the sugar
mills give up the practice of burn
ing bagasse, it will not be an un
parallelled case of a waste pro
duct becoming valuable. At one
time, still in the memory of many,
cottonseed was a useless by pro
duct ot the cotton gins, involving
some expeuse in its disposal so as
to prevent a nuisance and a men
ace. By the development of
years, cottonseed became a good
fuel, aud then stepped higher to a
commercial value which is great
enough to warrant the growing of
the plant, and the fighting of the
boll weevil, for the seed value
alone. The possible commercial
values of alcohol, vinegar, paper,
pulp, breakfast foods, etc , from
now fuel bagasse, may become
great enough to justify the culti
vation of sugar cane for these pro
ducts primarily. In this latter
event some other fuel would have
to take the place of the diverted
bagasse fuel. With oil at hand
more than one problem would be
readily solved.
Iu damp, chilly weather there is
always a large demand for BAL
LARD'S SNOW LINIMENT because
many people w'ho know by experi
ence its great relieving power in
rheumatiq aches and pains, pre
pare to apply it at the first twinge.

NEW IBERIA BOOMING.
The city of New Iberia, La., is
enjoying a great boom, and is rap
idly becoming one of the most im
portant mannfactnnng centers in
the State.
The latest mahufactnring con
cern to locate at New Iberia is a
corporation that will manufacture
paper and alcohol. The plant
will consume immense quantities
of sawdust, bagasse, cotton and
coru stalks and rice straw in the
manufacture of paper.
The alcohol will be extracted
from the sawdust and bagasse,
and the pulp will then be used in
the making of paper.
The paper mill and alcohol
plant will consume prodnets that
have heretofore been waste.—

"Why, Mary," said the aston

Pausing a moment in her task
Mary looked up and replied:
"I heard the man over at the
store say that there was money in
potatoes this year, and I was just
looking for some."

WHY THEY WENT
DEMOCRATIC.
The New York Herald, hide
pendent, in giving an explanation
of why certain states, usually 1L
publican, went Democratic at il.
election, attributes the loss ot
New Hampshire to the indiffi i > u •<
and carelessness of the Kepuoiic,,
national committee; Ohio to Gn
labor drift; Kansas to the women 's
vote, for pacifism; North Dakota
to the opposition of its large
Scandinavian population, to war
and their belief that President
Wilson was going to keep us out
of it—and Wyoming, Utah, N w
Mexico and Idaho to "gratitude
to the Democrats for putting back
the tariff on sugar, thus protect
ing the beet sugar industry."
If the Herald's explanation is
correct, the action of the Demo
cratic congress in reversing its if
on the sugar scheduled of the Un
derwood bill saved Mr. Wilson
and reelected him as president.
What the Herald said as to beet
sugar is equally applicable to car
sugar, for while the change did
not win the president any electoral
votes in the cane distiict, it had
the effect of cuttiug down the m
jority of Judge Martin, Progres
sive, m third Louisiana district
(the sugar district), from 1121 to
less than a huudred. Sugar did
it.—Times Picayune.

A BREEZY
ACKNOWLEDGMENT.
THE BREEZE of Funial
Springs, Florida cheerfully and
handsomely makes this statement:
"The Democratic Party owes its
victory and the election of Presi
dent to the votes of women in
those states where they are held
as the equals and not the infeiiors
of men". Since fonr towns in
Florida have given womeri tin
municipal suffrage, THE BREEZE
knows what votes for women can
accomplish. Florida is ahead of
other southern states in recoguiz
ing women.
