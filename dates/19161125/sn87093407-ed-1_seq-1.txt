The Seattle Star
» THE ONLY PAPER IN SEATTLE THAT DARES TO PRINT THE NEWS i
VOLUME 19.
Guy E. Kelly of Tacoma is one of the aspirants mentioned for speaker at the
coming session of the legislature.
WHY KELLY? Not only does he drip with "wet" association but also with the
cheapest and pettiest kind of small politics.
Kelly was a disturbing factor in the last legislature and one of the men who brought it into disrepute.
He belonged to and was dominated by the coterie of "statesmen" whose aim rose to no higher level
than to put the governor "in a hole" because he was a democrat.
He is today being sponsored by Jimmy Davis of Tacoma, whose claim to fame is allegiance to booze
interests and special privilege generally.
Kelly himself is the man who tinkered with the election laws and attempted to abridge the right of
the people to direct legislation. The overwhelming defeat of the referendum measures should be suf
ficient proof of how the Kelly brand of politics is looked upon by the people of this state.
The state wants to stay dry. WHY TAKE A CHANCE WITH KELLY AS SPEAKER?
The state does not want petty peanut politics. Why, then, consider Kelly? He doesn't fit in for leader,
ship in a dry, progressive state.
Nor is he the man to restore confidence in the republican party, discredited in
Washington by men of the Kelly and Jimmy Davis stamp.

More than 75,000 persons, the greatest
crowd that ever saw a football game, was in
the Yale Bowl today to see the annual Yale-
Harvard football game.
A driving wind and a temperature below
freezing made life decidedly interesting for
the football enthusiasts, and steamer rugs,
brilliantly colored sweaters and fur over
coats were much in evidence.
Advance notice said that 77,435 tickets
had been sold. In New Haven it was stated
that these did not include more than 200
press tickets and more than 400 side line
seats and a thousand or more temporary
seats erected at the last minute.
The proximity of Cambridge and
the lmportano« of the content gave
