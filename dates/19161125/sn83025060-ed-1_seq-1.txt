' A TOAST TO VICTORY
WIFE BEATERS OF
DRY OLD KANSAS
A Kansas town Is ccttlnjj up a pil
lory for wlfc-beatcrs. What are the
ctatistlcs concerning wlfe-bcatlnrj In
the Prohibition static, anyhow?
lo there any connection between
the habit of not drinking, and tho
habit of wife beat!nfl7 We know of
no other otatc In which wlfe-beatlng
la so prevs'ent that resort must bo
held to t'ic pillory to discourage It.
lo prohibition v.orth tho price If It
Icada to wifc-beatlnn? And Just why
when the psychic stimulant Induced
by alcohol Is removed, should n man
turn to wife-coating? la there also
n psychic stimulation In wife-beat-Ing?
We don't know nnythlnrj about It,
wo only Inquire. It soema to us to
be ono of thoso cases calling- for n
thoreuah Investigation by psycholo
Otsts, physical cclentlsts, sociolo
gical experts, and a book contain
ing two hundrod tables and a thou
sand pages. Such a book Is n ter
rible thing to contemplate, but
comothing must bs done to cavo
Kansas. New York Cun.
