of Three New Members to the
Council Next Week.
Mayor Thompson may present his
appointments to the board of educa
tion at tho meeting ot tlio city coun
cil next Monday. There nro eight
positions to bo filled. It 1h rumored
that tho mayor will appoint Jnmos
B. Forgan, La Vorno Noycs, and
Charles II. Wacker, It they aro will
ing to serve.
"I nm trying to got some of Chi
cago's big business men to tako
pliicen on tho board," Mayor Thomp
son said, "and I nm meeting with
Eomo success. I havo a lentatlvo list
of deslrablo persons. I havo not yet
decided whether I shall reappoint any
of tho present members whoso terms
havo expired."
If tho nppointments aro tnado next
Monday, It Is posslblo that tho city
council may approvo them In tlmo
for tho school board election on
December C. At least a week must
clapso beforo tho council expresses
its approval ot tho appointments.
Tho mayor said ho Is trying to get
"a big man" as commissioner of pub
lic works, but was not ready to an
nounco who will succeed W. II.
Moorhouso.
A comprehensive plan for tho ad
ministration of tho public schools,
whoroby a baro majority of tho mem
bers of tho board of education may
not bo ablo to defeat tho successful
operation of tho most advanced edu
cational principles Is bomg worked
out by tho Public Education associa
tion. Another organization, tho Chicago
Public School league, recently formed,
is busying Itself with tho problom of
raising tho stnndord of qualifications
for mcinbors of tho school board, and
Instituting measures that will rondor
reasonably certain thot tho trustees
solocted will measuro up to this
standard.
Tho . schools commltteo of tho
Woman's City club also Is preparing
n report that, It Is hoped, will lead to
a solution of many or tho dllllcultlos
that hamper tho administration ot
tho public schools. In about ton
days, according to Mrs. W. S. Hot
reran, chairman ot tho commlttoo, tho
report will bo submitted to tho club,
recommending legislation of radical
nature.
This report, It is cxpectod, will ask
for loglslutlvo action reducing tho
membership of tho board to sovon or
nlno, and to bo chosen by popular
election. Tho proposed law will de
fine tho legal stnttis of tho superin
tendent of schools and his functions,
nlBO tho functions of tho mombora of
tho board, nnd tho teachers' tonuro of
position.
Mrs. Hefforon Is a member of tho
board of trustees of tho Public Edu
cntlon association, and it is oxpoctod
that tho matters that nro bolng dis
cussed by tho Womnn's City club will
also rocolvo attention from this edu
cational body.
Superintendent John D. Shoop Is
bolng urged by teachers ot physical
training to extond tho military train
ing In tho schools. A number of re
ports havo been rocoived by him that
tho boys aro enthusiastic over tho
olomontnry mllltnry llfo they havo
scon thus far. Mora tlmo, nioro
equipment and moro assistants havo
beau nuked for.
ALDERMEN FAVOR
SUBWAYS
Transportation Committee De
cides That Chicago Must
Have Them Soon.
Tho city council commltteo on trans
portation is determined to build tho
subways.
No mombor ot tho commltteo, nor
Aldorman John D. Capltaln, Its chair
man, holds a brlof for Chicago's pres
ent methods ot transportation. Each
wnnts a subway nnd says ho la going
to work for a subway.
So aggressive is tho advocacy ot a
subway by Aldorman Capltaln that
tho impression horo is that a recom
mendation to this effect practically
FOUNDED 1889
Largt WmU? GrcuhliM Abmh
PMfk f laflumce m4 Stasis
has been decided upon by tho Chicago
traction and subway commission,
whoso report Is expected to bo placed
In tho hands of tho commltteo by De
cember 1.
"Thoro Is no question about our
need of a subway," said Aldorman
Capltaln. "Wo'vo talked about It a
long tlmo. Now Is tho tlmo to act."
Should tho commission ot engineers
recommend a subway for Chicago It
will find tho commltteo n unit In 'sup
port ot tho recommendation. Tho
feasibility and economy of subways,
Impressed particularly upon tho com
mltteo by Boston's underground sys
tem, appears to have their favor.

DARROW FOR
PRISON REFORM
Eminent Lawyer Perfects Plans
for Organization to Help
It Along.
Ono ot tho first problems of stnto
with which Covornor-Elect Frank O.
Loudon Is to bo confronted will bo
tho crying need of onrly and comploto
prison and parolo ro forms in Illinois,
Attornoy Clarence S. Darrow Is per
fecting plans for an organization to
point out tho urgoncy of tho situation
to tho govornor-olect soon. A cottngo
plan of imprisonment is to bo sug
gested. Tho organization will bo hendod by
Mr. Darrow nnd Mrs. Gortrudo Howo
DrlUon ot tho Wolfnro Lenguo. Mr.
Darrow said ho thought tho wholo
syBtom of prison confinement Is
wrong and that bow penltontlarlos, on
tho cottago plan, should bo headed
by a group ot trained workers ablo
to study tho ncods of tho Individual
prisoners. In this way, ho thinks,
many mon can bo reformed and made
into useful cltlzons. Ho said:
Tho wholo system is entirely
wrong. A man with a peculiar twist
in his brain which leads him to com
mit crimes has no chance to develop
his better nnturo, whereas under such
a, system as wo think ought to be
Inaugurated many of them would bo
saved.
Tho object of tho law Is reforma
tory rather than persecutory. Tho
prcsont organization makes It perse
cutory and that is tho evil which wo
hope to remedy. Thero is nil tho evil
In tho world in thoso who nro out of
tho penitentiary, and there is all tho
good in tho world in thoso who nro in
tho penitentiary. Lot us develop tho
good.
Mr. Darrow also attacked tho parolo
system, but not tho members of tho
parolo board. Ho said a man without
frionds, political Inlluonco or money
has no chance to gain his liberty. Ho
added:
"I do not mean by that that any
ot tho members of tho board would
tako a cent from any one. Just tho
oppoBlto Is true. But a prisoner must
havo somo ono to work for his Inter
ests, somo ono who can invcstlgato
his past, gather tho detail and prcsont
it to tho board so It will sco ho is
worthy of parolo.
"Thon, after ho Is released, ho must
bo romovod to an environment whoro
his bottor self will havo nn oppor
tunity to expand under tho guldanco
of thoso interested In him as an indi
vidual. Under tho prosont method ha
is paroled and allowed to return to
his old environment, and it Is tho
most natural thing in tho world that
ho should drift back into his old ways,
and, soonor or later, return to tho
penitentiary.
"I really bollovo prison nnd parolo
reform Is tho most Important work
confronting Mr. Lowden, and wo in
tend to holp him."
Mr. Darrow also said ho hoped to
Induco tho legislature to establish a
separata institution for detectives,
whoro they would bo ablo to develop
and where they might bo kept for llfo
it It was found impracticable to re
lease them.

ous associations devoted to civic re
form and to tho Investigation of tho

HOVNE FIGHTS ON
State's Attorney, on His Return from
Vacation, Declares His Intention of
Investigating: the City Hall.
The now field of alleged graft
opened by State's Attornoy Hoyno In
cludes, ho said, complaints ot graft
In tho letting of contracts by tho city;
In tho purchase of supplies by tho
city, In tho letting of docking con
tracts on tho river front, nnd of vio
lations of tho civil service law.
"I am going to Invcstlgato those
complaints and uso every facility In
my olllco to ferret out tho criminals, j
It thero nro any." Mr. Hoyno said. I
"If thero is sulllclont evidence
and tho Information I already havo
leads mo to bcllovo thero will bo
the grand Jury will bo given tho mat
ter for disposal, and Indictments and
prosecutions will follow as quickly as
tho legal machinery can be mado to
move."
Mr. Hoyno declared, howovcr, that
his fight against alleged graft in tho
polico department would bo tho first
Chicago,
to bo taken up by his department.
Ho also planned to carry boforo tho
city council tho act ot Chief of Polico
Healey In removing from his olllco
nil tho pollcomcn ho hud obtained to
do work under his direction.
"Four years ago whon I took olllco
I laid down tho plans which my olllco
would follow," ho snld. "Ono of thoso
plans wns tho ridding of tho police
department ot graft and Inefficiency.
"Chicago must rely on Its polico de
partment, and If tho head of that de
partment Is inolllclont and corrupt,
you can not oxpect moro from tho
rank and Mo,
"Any mayor or chief of polico could
clean tho crooks from tho department
In a wook and keep It clean. Tho
most Important thing in Chicago Is
to clean graft from that department.
I am going to keep up my fight until
tho last blot ot crookedness or Inef
ficiency Is removed.
"As I can obtain no assistance from
tho mayor I proposo to contlnuo my
Investigation nnd enrry tho matter
again to tho grand Jury for action."
CITY HAS COLD
STORAGE BAN
Federal Officials Wonder Why
Ordinance Has Not Been
Invoked.
Federal officials discovered tho ex
istence of city ordinances which if
enforced would prevent tho hoarding
ot food articles In cold storage plants
and would aid In tho campaign to
rcduco tho high cost of living.
Why tho ordlnanco which specific
ally forbids keeping articles of food
In cold storage for purposes ot fore
stalling tho mnrkot or Increasing tho
prices lias not been discovered by tho
city authorities, or why, It known, it
has not been invoked, Is the question
which somo of tho federal olllclnls
nro asking.
"Tho fact that eggs aro put Into
cold storage when thoy sell nt 17
cents for tho purpose of holding them
thero until tho prlco Is raised to moro
than 45 cents Is n clear case of fore
stalling the market and clearly In
violation of tho ordinances dealing
with that question," snld Assistant
United States District Attornoy John
II. Lolly today. "In going over tho
various methods by which tho per
sons nnd linns rosponslblo for tho
high cost of living enn bo brought
to tlmo wo stumbled upon tho city
onllnnnco. Why It has not been re
sorted to by tho city administration,
when It Is fo. easy to help tho situa
tion, Is a pertinent question for the
gonornl public to hnvo answorcd.
Perhaps tlu ordinance was over
looked. If thot Is true, then now Is
tho tlmo to begin to secure wannnts
for violations."
