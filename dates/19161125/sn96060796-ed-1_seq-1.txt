Norman J. McKenzie has
written a nice letter of congra
tulation to M. J. Bolin his
successful rival for the office of
state mine superintendent. He
has developed more speed than
Mr. Hughes who has as yet not
sent a note to President Wilson,
telling how he feels about it.

curative properties.
In the Mesa country there will

recently secured near Chandler.
Beautiful specimens of silver
glance ore, taken from the new
workings on the second level of
the World's Fair mine, were
shown on the streets of Pata
gonia this week. Even those
accustomed to seeing the rich
ore from this famous property,
were surprised at the richness
of the ore. Not much has been
said lately about the World's
Fair, but it is known that work
has been going on there all the
time in a small way. Patagon-ian.
Wells Abbott, a freshman at
the University of Arizona was
knocked down and seriously

state fair. Abbott, who was one
of those in charge of the state
game warden's exhibit at the
fair, entered the pen where the
deer was kept with his arms full
of hay. He was attacked by the
ducki which knocked him down
and gored'him with his antiers.
Abbott's clothes were torn to
shreds, and he received several
wounds in the legs. He was
rescued by other attendants.
The flag of the historic frigate

exhibition in the rotunda of the
statehouse at Phoenix as soon as
an appropriate ease can be built
for the ensign. The flag was
presented to the state of Arizona
by the town of Flagstaff on July
4, and is said to be one of the
oldest American flags in exist
ence. Fifteen hundred hogs have
been sold on the Kansas City
market in the last few weeks by
Charles Stewart. All were ship
ped from the Salt river valley, a
distance of 1,500 miles from the
Kansas City market. Mr.
Stewart says the sales have been
profitable io the face of the long
run because of the low cost of
producing hogs in the Salt River
valley, says the K. C. Drover's
Telegram.
Two new business blocks are
under way in Florence, one being
the new bank building and the
other the new building being
put up by Geo. Smith jointly
with the Chang brothers. Both
buildings will be of brick and
are located on Main street. Ex
cavations for the foundations
and basements are nearly com
pleted and the brick work will
follow immediately. Brick for
the Smith-Chang building is now
being placed on the ground.

A recent arrival from Wick
enburg states that the sampling
works and reduction plant being
erected at that place is going up
with a rush. It is probable that
the wheels will turn in about a
month. As a result of the
building of this plant, and the
consequent furnishing of nearby
market for ore, prospectors are
taking to the adjacent hills in
greater number than for years,
and owners of claims which have
been dormant are "getting
busy." Messenger.

of what the board believed to :
be the failure of the voter to I

appears that Democrats to the

down the .line and marked the

election returns, and until the
canvas is completed it will not

SUCCESSFUL FAIR.
The mines and smelters of Ari
zona during 1916 have been work
ing at a pressure so high that
they are probably making record
productions of all metals. If they
continue to work at the present
rate during the year, they will
make an output of over 600,000,
000 pounds of copper, against
about 450,000.000 in 1915, accor
ding to reports received by the
U. S. Geological Survey. A
corresponding increase in the
output of the precious metals and
in that of lead and zinc, which is
probable, will, at the greatly
increased prices, make the total
value of the output in 1916 nearly
double that of 1915, which was
about 38,000,000.
The old placer camp of La
Paz on the Arizona side of the
Colorado river in northern Yuma
county, is about to realize a
boom in the near future. This
district was one of the rich
propositions in placer mining in
the early fifties, and for years
contained a population of several
thousand gold diggers. It has
produced millions of dollars in
placer gold in the days when
the crudest method of mining
was in vogue. There is a record
of production of $500,000 from
one gulch alone, only the coarse
est gold being saved. Nuggets
weighing 3 12 pounds are of
record, from Farrer Gulch. Af
ter the cream of the district was
roughly skimmed, there was an
exodus from the camp, and for
years it has been inactive and
practically abandoned. -Messenger.
ARIZONA BONE DRY.
Arizona, reaffirming by a
majority vote its approval-of the
Prohibition law, has adopted the
most sweeping dry law of this or
any other country. It is the
most iron bound prohibition
measure ever made into law, and
The fair which came to a close
yesterday added another success
to the many successful exposi
tions which have been given in
Phoenix, of the products of Ari
zona. It has become a common
occurrence at the close of each
state exhibition to designate it
as the best ever held in the
state.
Sometimes the claim is deserv
ed and sometimes it is not justi
fied by actual facts. In most re
spects this latest one which has
just come to an end may be ap
propriately classified as among
the most successful ever held.
The exhibits in some of the
classes have fallen below those
of some of the other years, while
in others they have excelled
former exhibits. The latter is
particularly the case with the
mineral exhibits. While most
of the former exhibits have re
mained in place from year to
year the present year has seen
many new ones added.
This has been particularly the
case with those from Mohave
county, which alone added abo at
six tons of ore to her exhibit,
and which included samples
from nearly every mine in that
county.
Some of the other counties
have also added to their exhibits
and the mineral display this
year was greater than ever be
fore, and was all embracing in
the diversity of the ores shown.
In point of attendance the
management report it in excess
of any previous year, despite
the fact that the program of
races was less interesting than
has generally been provided be
fore, though a good offering
was made in this respect.
Barring professional s from all
over the country, in the auto
mobile races, and confining them
to amateurs in the state, perhaps
had the effect of drawing a few
less from outside it added in
terest to residents of the state,
from the fact that it was known
that they would not be outclassed
by foreign cars specially built
for racing.
The free attractions have been
unusually good and have given
satisfaction to all visitors, espe
cially the latest in the world of
sports, auto polo, which has been
conceded as the most thrilling
and fascinating offering on the
program of the week.
On the whole the fair has pro
ven an event which is highly
complimentary to the manage
ment, and it has closed without
a hitch or accident Gazette.
From the most complete retur
ns available, the following list
shows the candidates elected to
the two houses of the state legis
lature. While the returns are
not official, it is believed that
they are correct:

'THE WEST HAS SPOKEN."
' The west has spoken. That
is the great fact that stands oat
in the election returns which tell
of President Wilson's victory in.
the closest and most exciting
race ever known in American
history. There are other facts
to be sure and important ones.
The hyphenates who tried to
punish Wilson and seat a pre
sident who suited the wishes of
Berlin have been rebuked. But
the big, overwhelming thing is
the transfer of political power
from the east to the west, and
incidentally, from the crowded
industrial centers to the small
cities and the' farms. You can
travel in a straight line from
Turkey Point, Florida, to Port
Townsend, Washigton, on demo
cratic soil all the way. Thanks
to the decision of California, to
whom may the fates be kind, you
can travel due west from the
Mississippi river to the Golden
Gate in the same fashion, and
the only break in the complete
democracy of the Pacific coast is
furnished by Oregon. It is the
most amazing political revolution
ever known in this country, and
one of the most sanitary. It
giyes the west a dominating posi
tion in Democratic councils. It
wipes out the national influence
of Tammany." Chicago.Jonrnal.
