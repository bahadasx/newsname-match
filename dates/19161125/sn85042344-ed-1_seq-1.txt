LONDON, Nov. 24. Seemingly the
forces of the central powers are
endeavoring- to drive on Hucharest. the
Rumanian capital, from three direc

AVOU JOHN II. SIMMONS and
the city commissioners yesterday
held three conferences with executive
officers of the Kilts' lodge, and as a rc
sut, It was announced last night that
plans were well under way whereby
the city would purchase the Klks' club,
corner of Third und iiouliler, for a
city hall.
All that stands In the path to a
Successful closing of this thai, is the
hpproval of the members of the lodge,
which, it the expressions of executives
can be taken as an indication of the
sentiment of the order, will he forth
coming at a special called meeting,
scheduled to be held the early part
of next week.
The mayor and board of city com
missioners are heartily in favor of the
project.
Commissioner For It.
In the private conference held yes
terday, the commissioners went on
record as being in accord with tho
plan, and each last night expressed
himself as believing it the solution of
a problem which has been before their
body for the past several months, ami
which has been one of the tasks Mayor
Simmons und the other cly officials
placed upon their calendar when they
were inaugurated '"' office.
I'ntil the plan was suggested for the
purchase by the city of the Klks' club.
Mayor Simmons has been strongly in
favor of the purchase of a site now
oecupleu by the Tulsa high school at
the corner of Fourth and Cincinnati.
Representing- the city he made bids on
two occasions for this site, and each
was rejected by the school board.
Agitation was then started for a situ
at the corner of Fourth and Houlder,
but later it was found that other in-1
terests were attempting to secure thls
site, on which the Flist Christian!
church is located. Then the necessity
of securing a suitable sito for a city
hall, before all of the best locations
desirable for the purpose had been
built upon, presented itself to tho city
fathers.
Is Ideal Site.
Following a conference held yester
day afternoon with members of the
Kike, Commissioners C. S. Younkinan
and A. 1. Walker returned to tho city
hall and went into a private consulta
tion with Mayor Simmons und mem
bers of tho Klks' lodge.
"It Is the most feasible location that
has been presented," said Commis
sioner Younkinan, following the con
ference. "We need a city hall. There
is no argument on that point. Wo
need a building in which the depart
ments of tho city government may ex
pand as the work of the departments
and the city itself expands. .The Klks'
lodge offers these facilities, and I be
lieve thut the city of Tulsa would be
making a grave mistake to tuin down
this proposition."
Near Federal lliiildlng.
Commissioner Walker was of the
same opinion. "It Is just across the
street from the new federal building
anil lost office. It is removed but a
block from the main street of traffic
and yet Is out of the noise zone. This
is a feature that should be considered.
Then, too, tho Klks' building is a
modern structure, on the high pres
sure water mains. It Is on a car line
and Is in the very heart of the city,
adjacent to streets viaductod across
the tracks lending into the north side
of the city. I om for the proposition
with no reservations."
The Mayor's Views.
Mayor Simmons, the father of the
project, stands behind his contention
that now is the time to secure a city
hall, lie declared last night that he

a wide detour und swung off to the
northwest on their cow ponios. This
attack continued until after 9 o'clock

tempt of the Villa bandits to capture
Santa Rosa hill, to tho southeast of
the town and obtain possession of tho
cannon upon the crown of this hill.
Among the wounded today was Gov.

direction with his cavalry and cut the
bandits off from the trains on which,
they camu from Santa Rosalia.
There have been no disorders w ithin
