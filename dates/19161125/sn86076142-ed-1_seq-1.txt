dits from the east was begun at 6
o'clock Friday and was repulsed, as
were the previous attacks by the
bandits, with heavy losses to the at

NEW YORK, Nov. 25. Behind the
$60,000 Harrlman jewel robbery,
brought to solution today by police
investigation, lies a story of a middle
aged and trusted employe who suc
cumbed to temptation, according to
his confession, while struggling to
meet the cost of living in a fashion
able suburb too expensive for bis
means. As a result be is under
arrest, charged with grand larceny,
together with his brother, who is held
on a similar charge, accused of hav
ing disposed of part of the proceeds
of the robbery.
Arthur P. Daggett, 42 years old,
and married, who was guardian of
the trust company vault where Mrs.
E. H. Harrlman,' widow of the rail
road capitalist, kept her jewelry,
found them one day on the floor of
the safe deposit, he told Police In
spector Faurot today.
"The opportunity presented itself.
as I was In debt to the extent of
$700," the Inspector quoted Daggett
as saying. "My salary was not
large one. I was getting only $1700
a year and I found It hard to live on
that amount and keep up with the
living at Larchmont. I was tempted
many times to put the jewelry back,
but I held it for some time waiting to
see, who owned it, and when no one
put In a claim that it was lost I
decided to get a loan on some of It."
Daggett's brother, Orville, 48 years
of age, is accused of having dis
posed of a $40,WO ruby, part of the
stolen jewelry. It was purchased,
according to the police, by an opti
cian for $650 from a man to whom
Orville Is asserted to have disposed
of It. The ruby was thereafter sev
eral tiroes sold until Its travels fur
nished a clue which led to the
apprehsnaion of the Daggett brothers.
