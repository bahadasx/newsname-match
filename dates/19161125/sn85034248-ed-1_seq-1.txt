"Husband and Wife," a thrilling
domestic drama written by Charles
Kenyon, author of "Kindling," will
be the attraction at the Gem today.
The stage version of this noted pro
duction held the boards at the 48th
Street Theatre in NewYork city nearly
the entire season of 1915, and was
pronounced by the metropolitan cri
tics to be one of the most remarkable
plays of recent years. As made into
a Ietion picture under the personal
supervision of William A. Brady, it
is presented by an all-star cast supe
rior to any ever assembled for a five
reel production, the leading roles be
ing portrayed by Ethel Clayton, Hol
brook Blinn, Emmett Corrigan, Gerda
Holmes, Montagu Love, Dion Tither
adge and little Madge Evans. Messrs.
Corrigan, Titheradge and Loye play
in the film version the same roles they
made famous on the speaking stage.
Alec Francis and Frank Beamish also
have prominent parts in the produc
tion.
Having himself seen to the proper
development of all the details of the
play for the stage, Mr. Brady looked
after these same details in the screen
presentation, thereby assuring the
same technical correctness which
marked the Broadway performances.
A virile story of domestic and finan
cial intrigue, full of suspense, and
teaching a strong moral lesson, "Hus
band and Wife" is one of the greatest
photodramatic releases of the year.
"Without a Soul."
"Without a Soul," in which Clara
Kimball Young, more than beautifully
lovable, will be seen at the Gem
Theatre tomorrow, deals with a most
interesting question, namely: that of
life after death.
Lola, the beautiful young daughter
of Dr. Barnehelm, a scientist, is be
loved by all who know her for her
sweet ways, and her many kindly
deeds of charity.
She learns to her dismay that one
of her suitors, Richard Fenway, is a
married man, his wife living in the
west, and she promptly decides to
have nothing more to do with him.
With her father's sanction, she be
comes engaged to John Dorris, a man
ly young chap, and the two are bliss
fully happy in their love for each
other.
After many years of research, Dr.
Barnehelm at last perfects a wonder
ful chemical, which will restore life
to the dead. He confides the glad
tidings to Dr. Crosset, a distinguished
German scientist, and they eagerly
prepare to experiment with the mar
velous discovery.
As they are discussing the matter,
Lobt's dead body is brought in. She
had been struck by an automobile and
instantly killed. Dr. Barnehelm,
heart-broken over the loss of his be
loved daughter, decides to experiment
on her.
The experiment is in part success
ful-Lola reawakens to life, but her
soul is gone. Her noble character and
sweet disposition have undergone a
complete change. From a confiding,
lovable girl, she becomes an ill-tem
pered, self-willed, avaricious woman.
She uses the money her father earns
to finance his discovery, to buy her
self elaborate gowns and hats. She
will have nothing further tO do with
her fiancee, John, and under pretense
of being engaged in charitable mis
sions, she meets Richard Fenway and
goes about with him. She accepts his
jewels and other gifts, and finally
runs away with him. But her nature
has been so completely ruined that
she soon tiresof him, and leaves with
another admirer.
At last, nature rebels. Lola's
health breaks down, and the doctor
tells her she is afflicted with incura
ble heart trouble.
Cynical and hard to the last, she
returns to `her grief-stricken old
father, and ans .ers his glad words of
welcome with tte taunt that she had
not come back spentant, and in rags,
as he had no doubt expected, but
garbed in handsome clothes and jew
els. She tells him further that her
only reason for returning is that she
knows she is going to die soon, and
that he must restore her to life-and
even as she speaks, she grasps at her
heart, and sinks down, dead.
Dr. Barnehelm gazes with deepest
sorrow and pity at her dead' form,
but he has learned his lesson. Not
again will he attempt to give life to
the dead.
He smashes his instruments that
had cost him so many years of labor,
and now, at last, his beloved daugh
ter, as he bows his head in grief over,
her lifeless body.

"The Iron Woman."
t "The Iron Woman," with Nance
O'Neil, one of the foremost dramatic
actresses of the country, in the-title
role, will be the, Sunday feature at
traction at the Grand Theatre. The
g picture is founded on the noted novel
!s of the same name written by Margaret
11 Deland, and has been produced on an
r. elaborate scale. Many of the scenes
in and around the iron mills, which
h figure so prominently in the story,
y were photographed at the famed steel
s plant at Bethlehem, Pa. The explo
sion, where the "Iron Woman" is se
e riously injured, is a thrilling and real
o istic feature of the production. The
.1 old-fashioned home and the old-fash
t ioned clothes worn by the "Iron Wo
man" are among some of the artistic
touches, and in striking contrast are
- the lively scenes and situations where
in the son of the wealthy woman is
concerned.
"Anton the Terrible."
The Monday offering at the Grand
will be "Anton the Terrible," featur
ing Theodore Roberts and Anita King.
The story, which created such a sensa
tion when it was published in the
Saturday Evening Post, has to do
with the intrigues in the Russian gen
eral staff shortly after the outbreak
of the present European war.
Anton, although chief of the Rus
ian secret police, is in reality a Ger
man spy. How a clever woman, to
save her lover, succeeds in trapping
Anton and confronts him with his
guilt, is presented in an unusual and
startling manner. The scenes of the
pictures are laid in Petrograd and on
the steppes of Siberia, and the photo
drama is produced with more than
the usual Lasky excellence, under the
personal direction of William C. De
Mille, the distinguished dramatist and
director.
"Sporting Blood."
All the excitement of the race
track runs through William Fox's
photoplay of the turf, "Sporting
Blood," Which comes to the Grand
Tuesday. The story deals with the
plot of two persons, a man and a wo
man, against the gambler who has
tried to ruin their lives. In the end
they are successful, but not until they
have gone through many adventures
to gain their purpose.
Dorothy Bernard and Glen White
are the stars of the picture. Miss Ber
nard plays the part of Mary Ballard,
whose brother has been ruined
through the manipulations of Dave
Garrison, notoriou# figure on the turf
and in gambling houses. Mr.. White
plays Jim Riddle, who has his sister's
score to settle with Garrison.
Riddle and Mary combine to re
venge themselves on the racing king.
Garrison becomes infatuated with
Mary, and she, realizing his inten
tions, says: "If I'm worth winning,
play the game."
Then she bets herself against $10,
000 that Shooting Star, Garrison's
horse, will not win. She has her own
horse at home, Bay Belle, which re
sembles Shooting Star closely. By
clever manipulation, she manages to
change the two horses, runs Bay Belle
as Garrison's horse, and Shooting
Star as her own.
The result is that the horse running
for the girl wins. Garrison is ruined,
and forced to leave the turf forever.
Mary and Jim are successful.
"The Lash."
Marie Doro will be seen at the
Grand Wednesday in "The Lash," a
vital society drama written especially
for her by the noted writer, Paul
West.
The little island of St. Ba'tiste,
where the first few scenes of the pic
ture are laid, was settled centuries
ago by hardly voyagers from O4ittany,
and although the rest of the world has
advanced, this island still retains the
customs and the religious bigotry of
its discoverers. The inhabitants are
ruled by a "Perfect," whose word is
absolute la , and one the customs
is that a y woman srificing her
honor is be lashed, 'y the "Per
fect," acr s the sho ers with a
heavy whip 17
Miss Doro is seen ` the daughter
of this "Perfect." She falls in love
with a young chap from the outer
world who has been nearly drowned
and brought to her father's house.
She goes to the mainland and they
are married. Later she is the idol of
fashionable society, when an attract
ive young widow attempts to take
her husband away from her.
How the girl of the island applies
the law of her ancestors to this so
ciety butterfly, aid eventually wins
back her husband,-is brought about in
a manner which must be seen to be
understood and eljoyed.
"The~Kid."
"The Kid," wihh is booked for
presentation at thi Grand next Fri
day, offers that icharming bit of
femininity, Lillian~ alker, as its star.
"The Kid," a iuightly miss of
seventeen, is worjoyed .at re
ceiving an appois-ieat on -the staff
of the New York rrald, through the
influence of Joe 4d, the star re
porter, who has brought the girl ui
te as his daughter. To arm her proper
n ly for the battle of life, Joe tells her
how her mother was betrayed by s
d man named Dunster in her homc
town. Joe had befriended the un
a fortunate young woman, and when
her child (the "Kid") 'vas born, and
e the mother died, Joe decided to bring
the child up himself. With a final
.n warning to beware the pitfalls of the
great city, Joe takes her to the Herald
e office to begin her career. t
Soon after, when the price of meat
g shows :.n alarming rise, the Herald
d assigns the Kid to unearth the cause.
While on the hunt for particulars,
the Kid sees Robinson, one of the
large cattle owners of the west, who
has come to the city for a business
e trip. She follows him, waits while he
has his shoes shined, and then, when
e turning a corner, loses him in the
crowd. Hurrying home, she assumes
the disguise of a bootblack and ob
tains a position at the stand where
she had seen Robinson.
n True to her expectations, Robin
son appears next day, and while
shining his shoes she hits on a clue.
That day, Robinson's wife, a charity
worker, is murdered while riding in
her car, and the murderer makes good
his escape. Some time later the Kid
manages to obtain a position in Rob
inson's office and gets evidence which
apparently not only connects hin vith
the manipulation of the meat market,
but also with the murder of his wife.
She arranges to have two detectives
planted in the room next day to se
cure further evidence of his connec
tion with the murder, but they over
hear a conversation which convinces
them that Hidalgo, manager of Rob
I inson's cattle enterprises, is the real
murderer and he is taken into custody.
The Kid swears out a warrant against
Robinson for his connection with the
rise in meat, but Joe Hazard, seeing
and recognizing Robinson, tells the
Kid he is her own father, Dunster,
under an assumed name. Dunster
learns that the Kid is his daughter
and begs leniency. She finally secures
his freedom after exacting a promise
from him to devote to charity a por
tion of the money he has unlawfully
gained, but when he comes to claim a
daughter's love, she" turns to Joe, who
has been her "daddy" for all these
years, and leaves Dunster a broken
hearted man.

SCHOOL FARM IN FINE SHAPE.
State Inspector Commends Work Be
ing Done at Oak Grove School.
P. L. Guilbeau, state inspector of
agricultural schools, makes the fol
lowing remarks concerning the Oak
Grove school of this parish in a re
port submitted to State Superintend
ent T. H. Harris under date of Oct. 9:
"This school opeped with a good at
tendance and the work in the agricul
turat department promises well for
this session. The principal and agri
culturist have already started their
club work, and the interest which had
died out for this type of work in the
school is showing new life. Some of
the school exhibits at the Dutchtown
fair were very good and deserve spe
cial commendation. The crops rais
edi on the farm are, for the most part,
very satisfactory. A large quantity
of various kinds of hay has been sav
ed. More corn than will be needed
for the farm animals has been raised
and about one acre of cotton will
yield about 1000 pounds in the seed.
The potato crop has not yet been har
vested, but promises to be very good.
The cotton stalks have beeni broken
and the land prepared for a winter
cover crop. All of the farm animals
are in good shape and both the farm
boar and yearling mule took prizes at
the community fair. An agricultural
library is very badly needed in this
school and Mr. Wise, the agricultur
ist, and Miss Guilbeau have prom
ised to raise the funds necessary for
this purpose. Twenty-two boys are
taking agriculture."

PARISH TEACHERS' INSTITUTE.
Annual Five-Day Se sion to Be Held
Here Jan. to 6.
Supt. H. P. Brous" rd has address
ed the followi circ.llar letter to the
teachers of t paris: :
Donaldso .le, L , Nov. 5, 1916.
Dear Teach: Tehe' n
The Ascen ion Parish Teahers' in
stitute will begin itr session at 1
o'clock Tuesday, January 2, 1917, and
will end Saturday, January 6, at 12
o'clock noon.
Before presenting the program I
have Ntlined for 4~e week, I .all
briefly being to yoitr attention What
I shall expect of the teachers of the
parish to make this institute a suc
cess.
1st. You will be paid for attending
the institute, the se as a regular
school week. I sh 1, therefore, ex
pect the teachers to-report promptly
for the opening at one o'clock Tues
day and to be present every day. Any
teacher, irrespective of any cause,
who is absent a day or part of a day,
will forfeit his salajr for that day or
lart of that day. This rule will be
rigidly enforced.
2nd. The program, issued at this
time, will give all teachers participat
ing on assigned topics ample time to
make careful preparation, and excel
lent results will be expected. It is not
expected that a teacher will venture
to ask the superintendent to "try
someone else who can do better."
Your best is all that will be asked of
you. Do not lose sight of the fact
that the teacher on the program is
only leading in the discussion and that
we are responsible,.tas a result of our
study of the topic, for the success of
the one leading. If this is under
stood thoroughly by all teachers our
institute will not pnly be a success.
but will be a source vf pleasure to all.
3rd. As a rule teachers do not look
forward to an in itute with very
much pleasure, and as a result the
work accomplished is poor. The bene
fit you will derive from this meeting
will be measured by the interest anc
good will you may manifest. Last
January it was the consensus of opin
ion of all teachers -present that the
meeting was a suocess. I attribute I
this largely to the friendly discussions
and frank expressions participated in
by all teachers. I hope you will come
with the same spirif this session and
that this institute .rill surpass the
other in beneficial results.
The program for the institute will
be as follows:

MRS. R. A. BAKER.
d Feeling Tribute to Memory of True
Christian Woman.
Mrs. Louise Wing Baker, whose
e mother was a cousin o Abraham Lin
coln, was born at B. wster, Mass.,
March 19, 1836. Them in early life
with her family she mbred to Michi
gan, where, in Medina township,
she was married in 1854 to
I Reusalear A. Baker, and there lived
I on a farm until her husband's death
in 188,; after which, with her three
children---Eugene, Carrie and Her
I bert--she moved to Morenci, Michi
I an, which place she evei~afterwards
Sconsitdered her home. In 1894 she
:anie to White Castle, La., to live with
her son, Herbert L. Baker, who a year
before had accepted a position with
the White Castle Lumber Co.
Following a custom of spending
the summer- months with friends and
home folk in Morenci, from which she
had varied only once since coming
;outh, it was on the occasion of this
ari nual home-going visit, in company
with her granddaughter, Miss Olive
Baler, who was acting as both her
companion and her nurse, that she
Ascended to "the house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens," Fri
day morning, Oct. 20, 1916, while a
guest of V. E. Baldwin, a brother of
Mrs. H. L. Baker.
Assisted by the pastor of the Mo
renci Baptist church, of which Sister
Baker had continued to be a member,
and the pastor of the local Methodist
church, the funeral was conducted by
Rev. C. E. Wakefield, of the Michi
gan M. E. Conference, a long-time
friend of the family, and a member of
the firm of Baker-Wakefield Cypress
Co., of Plattenville, La. The pall
bearers were old friends of the fam
ily from the Medina Baker home com
munity, and the music was rendered
by the local Methodist choir.
Since Sister Baker was a lover of
flowers, and took special notice of
them as love tokens at the burial of
friends and dear ones, it was a happy
coincidence that her casket should
have been profusely covered with
,hese fragrant emblems of love and
purity. For since they could not be
oresent in person, her friends and the
employees of Brother Baker's lum
ber mill at Plattenville, La., where as
1 member of the family his mother
had spent the last years of her life,
s.nt through northern florists a very
beautiful offering of artistically ar
ranged flowers. The members of the
Donaldsonville Sunday School, of
which Brother Baker is the superin
tendent, also sent a floral offering. To
the flowers from Donaldsonville were
attached a card bearing the inscrip
tion: "A love token from Louisiana
friends who were blessed by the last
'years of heft genuinely pious and un- 2
celfish life."
While from other standpoints Sis
ter Baker was a most exemplary
:haracter, it was in her home that
her practical saintliness was seen to
')est advantage, and her mother love
was seen to be most beautiful. Her
:on, with whom she lived, was her
ideal and her joy-her own boy
'Bert." And his wife and daughter
were to her as dear children, and min
istered to her needs during the years
of her increasing feebleness with a
tenderness all but as rare as it was
beautiful. In them was her life
wrapped up.
But Sister Baker's interests and
service did not'stop in the home, for
every cry of human need appealed to
her, and she was a close observer and
7tudent of the times, even to having
t lively interest in the political issues
of the country. And the church
never had a more devoted and con
secrated adherent than was she.
Her characteristics, as nearly as
miny one whom we have ever known,
were those set forth as marks of` the
ideal woman in Proverbs 31:10-31.
She "stretched out her hand to the
poor .......and to the needy, and was
not afraid of the snow for her house
hold........She opened her mouth with
wisdom........and the law of kindness
was on her tongue........Her children
rise up to call her blessed."
No more perfect saint were we ev
yr blessed in knowing, and the value
of her life in establishing the worth
of christian character where she lived
and served is beyond estimate. She
was patient, kind, unselfish, consecra
ted, spiritual, and Christ-like. She
was "Grandma Baker," the mother to
her community, the sinners' friend,
the mourners' comforter, and the
minister to every one who had need.
"Many daughters have done ex
cellently, but thou excellest them all."

Banquet to John M. Parker.
Mayor Behrman and many other
regular Democrats of New Orleans
have signified their intention to par
ticipate in the "recognition banquet"
to be given John M. Parker. Appli
cations for reservations are coming in
from all over the state. From 500 to
1000 are estimated as likely to take
part in the big affair, attesting to De
mocracy's appreciation of John M.
Parker's and the Progressives' sup
port of President Wilson.
It is to everybody's interest to pa.
tronize home industries. No com
munity can succeed where this policy
is not carried out. Keep your money
at home.
