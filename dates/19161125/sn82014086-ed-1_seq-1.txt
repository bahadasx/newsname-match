JUDGE HOOK'S DECISION IS
TO BE USED IN TEST CASE
To Determine the Constitutionality of
the Adamsoit Act. -
Washington, Nov. 24.--Attoraey-General
Gregory telegraphed the gov
ernment atifa'neys In Kansas City to
night that he approved the plans for
expediting to the supreme court a test
case to determine the constitutionality
oi me Adamson act agreed upon tnere
by the government counsel and rail
road lawyers.
The case to he used as a test is
that brought by the Missouri, Okla
homa and Gulf Railroad in which
Judge Hook of the federal court at
Kansas City decided against the gov
ernment. The transscript of the rec
ord in that case is expected at the
department of Justice tomorrow and
will be promptly filed with the su
preme court. "
The attorney-general said the
agreement would be' signed by the
government and railroad council in
Kansas City. The railroad lawyers in
Washington who ..took up the negotia
tions first were notified of this ar
rangement and ' the matter was re.i
garded as finished and the way clear
ed to get the case to. the, supreme
court. The transcript - n?:iy be filed
at once but the court does not re
convene until December 4, ' when
counsel for both sides will ask - that
an early; date be set for argument.
If an' early, dat.ev is fixed the gov
ernment hopes the case may be de
termined before January 1, when, the
law becomes effective. Vfffrer the
agreement it was pointed, .cut here,
the department agrees not to insti
tute any prosecutions undr the law
before the determination iot- the Mis

does not mean, however,hat the gov
ernment may not collect evidence on
which future prosecutions may be
based if the law is found constitu
tional. ,
As understood here the carriers
coming into the agreejnent would keep
such accounts as are' necessary under
the law to make payments to the af
fected employes in case the law is held
constitutional. This requirement is
incorporated in Judge Hook's decision

38. ACRE TRACT FOR OLD
KASSAN NATION ALMONUMENT
Includes the Well . Known ' Abandoned
Village of That Name in Alaska.,
Washington, Nov. 24. The "Old
Kassan National Monument," consist
ing of 38 acres within the Tongass Na
tional Forest, Alaska, - -Jias -just beet
created by presidential, proclamation
as a result of recommendations made
by the Secretary of Agriculture. The
tract embraces the well-known aban
doned Halda Indian village of Old
Kassan, situated on Prince of Wales
Island in Southeastern Alaska, about
thirty miles west of "Ketchikan. ,
The village was abandoned by the
Indians about ten years ago. Among
the relics which remain- there are
about fifty Indian totem poles, five or
six of which are classed as exceed
ingly good specimens. In the desert
ed village there are also eight large
square buildings which were original
ly constructed according to the pe
culiar plan of the Haida Indians, and
which; it is stated by those best qual
ified to know, represent the best spec,
imens. of Haida architecture that now
exists. The largest of these buildings
Is approximate' 40 by 80 feet in size
and is made entirely of round and
carved timbers. There also remain a
number of Indian graves with the typi
cal small grave houses Greeted by the
Alaskan ndians.
Since the village was abandoned by
the. ndians the buildings have been
rapidly falling into a state of dilapi
dation aijd, decay, and a certain
amount of vandalism .by tourists and
souvenir hunters renders some form
of protection essential. An examin
ation of the area was made jointly by
representatives of the Forest Service
and of the Interior Department, and
reports strongly urging the establish
ment of National Monument were ap
proved by the secretaries of both de
partments. The Smithsonian Institu
tion strongly endorsed the proposition
for the establishment of a National
Monument. The new National Monu.
ment will be protected and adminis
tered by the Forest Service, as Is the
case with all monuments located
within the National Forests.

BUSINESS DOESN'T GROW WITHOUT PUBLICITY
There are some people who will tell you that it is pretty slow
business waiting around for new customers to be born, and there is
little wonder that they arrive at such a conclusion for they are doubt
less depending upon the customer to ferret them out and develop
. their business for them instead of getting busy and letting those
within a proper trading radius of their store know' that they are en
gaged in the business of selling goods which -the people w-ant and de
sirous of , securing their patronage. . . ' . .
What Is needed in sueXcases is publicity. Start a, campaign of
advertising that will reach ttuscustomers that are wanted. They
read the newspaper and they have -come to rely upon it for informa
tion concerning trade opportunities. The. result is that the merchant
who advertises doesn't have to stand around and wring his hands and
wonder why business doesn't grow.
The thing to do is to go after the customer instead of waiting for
him to stumble upon your store and the best method of doing that
is through the advertising columns of The Bulletin because it cir
culates thoroughly throughout not only Norwich and vicinity but the
whole of Eastern Connecticut." V .. :

now in Chihuahua, Mexico, and for the i
military control of the border, but with !
the supplemental stipulation that the
United States troops shall be sent In- j
to Mexico in pursuit of bandits at any

the members of the Mexican-American
joint commission. '
One of the official copies was taken
by Albert J. Pani of the Mexican com

York, whence he will start Monday
for Queretaro, where he will submit
it to General Venustiano Carrapza for
his approval.- The other copy will be
delivered to the American government
by Secretary of the Interior Franklin
K. Lane, -chairman -of ihe American
commission, ho left here late today
for Washington. "
" Yet to Be Ratified.
If the protocol is ratified by the two
governments the commission will con
vene again on December 8, to resume
the discussion of other questions' af
fecting the two countries, especially
those related to the protection of the
life and property of Americans : and
other foreigners in Mexico.- If rati
fication by either government is with
held, the work of the conference will
be declared at an end. .
WTien the adjournment sessions of
the commission will be held, was not
determined when the conference was
finished. :
Paraphrase of the Agreement.
That question -was -left to Sec
ret. Try of State . Lansing and Ambas
sador-designate Arredonslo. Following
is a paraphrase of the agreement to
which the last signature was affixed
at S.49 o'clock this afternoon:
"First The American - troops now
in Chihuahua, commanded . by Gen
eral John J. Pershing, shall be with
drawn within forty days from the ap
proval of the protocol by the respec
tive governments provided that within
that time the conditions in that part
of Mexico have not become such as
to endanger the American-bordeat In
such event the time shall be extend
ed. i Patrol of Border. v
"Second The Mexican army shall
patrol the the Mexican side of the hor
de rand American army the Ameri
can side but this shall not preclude
co-operation between the two forces
to preserve peace Upon the border.
Third It shall.be left '.to the com
manding officers- of the armies on the
border of both . nations to enter into
such arrangements for co-operation
in operations against bandits when
ever it is possible.
"The right of the American gov
ernment to send troops across the
border, in pursuit of bandits was not
Incorporated in the protocol but was
made the subject of - a supplemental
memorandum. Tlie TJexicans had
contended earnestl' against signing
any agreement in which they appear
ed to sanction what they termed the
violation of their national territory.
It was the agreement of the Ameri
cans finally to content themselves
with stating the attitude of the Unit
ed States in a separate memorandum
that induced the Mexicans to sign the
agreement."
It became known today that the
first i quest of the Mexicans for a
rpcess was made several days ago.
They desired to submit to General
Carranza all the facts in the case and
to obtain from him his advice as to the
course they should take. The Ameri
cans o;)i.osed such action, contending
that further delay was inadvisable.
Yesterday the insistence of the Mexi
cans resulted in consideration of the
suggestion and today the discussion
was resumed with all members of the
commifsijn present.
Carranza's Approval Necesary.
The Mexicans were yet not willing
to sign, but the Americans succeeded

Mexicans Wanted Limitations.
The Mexicans contended earnestly
for the incorporation in the protocol of
a clause providing that if troops were
sent across the line in pursuit of ban
dits Ihey should be moved only to
certain distances; that they .should
comprise only certain arms of service
and Include only a specified number of
men; that they should be kept In the
country only a certain time and that

regions. To all these arguments the .
Americans were firm In their Insist

tions. The article providing for the mili
tary control of the border was con
densed from elaborate and Intricate
plans whose consideration has taken
much of the time of the commission.

Mexican Members Non-Committal.' "
The Mexican :, commissioners were
non-committal tonight as to their hope
of ratification by their first chief. The
Amberlcans "hoped" General Carran
za vould approve the acts of his rep
resentatives, but it was manifest they
were not unduly optimistic. Through
out the conference that began on Sep- "
tember 4 the Mexicans have Insisted .
the first chief and his official family
would not aree to any violation of
Mexican terrlory.
If the agreement Is ratified thr
will begin a long consideration of the
remaining questions that the American
government regards as vital to the full '
restoration of friendly relations with
Mexico. These include taxes, threat
to confiscate property, sanitary condi
lions and claims. Such problems are
regarded bythe Americans as essen
tially basic and necessary to an un-
derstanding. '
