Worker If Promotion
Comes
(Serial Star-Bulletin CorreBjndeare)
HILO, Nov. 24. When the ' news
reached Hilo this week that William
McKay would likely succeed , Superin
tendent Sheedy of the Inter-Island
Steam Navigation Company, an open
awret that has been burning the soul
tases out of several people for months
past, became pubhe." The news was
received by the people not "in the
know" with mingled feelings, i They
were pleased to hear of popular "Bil
ly" McKay's possible well-deserved
promotion, and yet the thought that
he might be leaving the town where
he has resided for the past 18- years
caused a pang or two. Men like Wil
liam McKay are not plentiful and
everybody felt that it he left the
town there would be a gap hard to
fill. .;.' Tv:'--r
Then- after the first news arrived,
came the next question: Who will
succeed McKay if he goes to Honolu
lu? Rumor has it that! P. T. Phillips,
known all over .the islands as "Pete,"
will step into the shoes of McKay.
This is looked upon with great favor
by the shippers and traveling public
who know how popular "Pete" has
proved to be while acting as purser
of the good ship Mauna Kea, Of course
it Is not absolutely settled that Mc
Kay goes to Honolulu, but It looks
that way, and that would, In all proba
bility; mean that Phillips would suc
ceed the present manager of the
Inter-Island company's branch office
in Hilo. !
William McKay will be sadly missed
In Hilo, where he has ever taken a
very active Interest in all things per
taining to the public good. He is just
rounding out his term as president of
the Hilo board of trade, and he has
proved to be an excellent executive of
ficer. During the past year the board
of trade has accomplished a great
amount of work and It has been put
through with despatch. As chairman
of the fifth civic convention commit
tee, Mr. McKay carried out : a most
successful campaign of 8 months or
so and wound un everything in a blaze
i of glory that Is still spoken of when
ever a Hilo man meets a resident oi
any of the other Islands. '

Rev. C. 'II. McVey'a crnsade against
vice in the Kallhl district, directly
adjacent to his church, has so far
been successful.
This morning in police court the
old Hawaiian woman, Kakalina, whom
the pastor and prosecuting attorney
caused to be arrested as the owner of
one of the disorderly houses, was
found guilty of conducting a disorder
ly place. Upon recommendation of
Prosecuting Attorney Chlllingworth,
acting on a suggestion from Mr. Mc
Vey, the defendant was given a sus
pended sentence by Police Judge Mon
sarrat, who warned her not to allow
drunken persons on her premises in
the future or to make her place a com
mon nuisance in any way. :
On the witness stand both Rev. Mc
Vey and his playground athletic di
rector, Sergt Long - of Fort Shaf ter,
told of several Instances of disorder
llness at the Kakalina' place. McVey
said he had driven a negro soldier
away from the place once with a club
and at another time had thrown one
over the fencei The pastor said they
never came back. v'- -'
.The prosecution' had ' several morel
witnesses to introduce tnis mornmff 10
testify to the disturbances at the place,
and Attorney "VV. J. Sheldon for the
defense also had more witnesses but
both rested their case when McVey

"I don't w?aht' to' see the old lady

do want the Tough stuff done away
with in. that neighborhood. I believe
if she is found guilty and given a sus
pended sentence that the effect will
be a discontinuance of disturbances.
At least I hope so."
Yesterday afternoon the tenitirial
grand jury, which Is investigating vice
conditions, was anxious to have Mc
Vey before it . and had . a twq-hou?
search for him, but he was nowhere
to be found. As a matter of informa

The first two periods looked alt

15 tallies at the end of it, and many
football critics were beglnnina to call

men of the Navy "came back" with a

It was In the third half that the

a series of skilful maneuvers which
soon had the Army trying vainly to
stop them. Keeping the cadets on
the defensive, never giving them a
chance to carry the ball, the Middies
began a line-smashing game which
was splendidly diversified with end
runs, dashes off tackle and forward
passing. It was a wonderful reversal
of form, and while It lasted the Navy
took the ball from its own 5-yard line
to the Army's 25-yard mark.

NEW HAVEN, Conn Nov. 25.
Yale's sturdy sons turned the tide of
football battle against Harvard ten
dry in a game of skill and brawn and
grit which, kept the largest crowd
that ever saw an intercollegiate ath
letic event in the country tense with
expectation from the first to the last
whistle.
By a score of 6 to 3 Yale reversed
the unfavorable decisions of years
past and sent -the Crimson warrior
home beaten but not' disgraced. It
was one of the many close contests
between these teams, staged as tho
premier event of the gridiron season.
Harvard scored in the first period
on a field goal. In the second Yale
scored a touchdown. The goal was
not made.
Then, with the score 6 to 3 In Yale'a
favor, the battle went for two moro
periods, very largely in the center of
the field, with Yale using strategy and
skill to play safe and keep Harvard
from scoring distance. Thanks to ef- ;
fective punting, this policy won.
The two big teams trotted out on
the smooth field In the Yale bowl
shortly before 2 o'clock this afternoon
and; ran through a Tew practise slg

The weather was fine, contrary to ad

considerably faster than had been ex

Harvard Scores Early
Harvard scored in the first period
when Percy Haughton's team got-the
ball within striking distance of the
Yale goal and Robinson, the Harvard
back; whose toe has contributed to.
a Crimson victory, several times this
season, fell back of his line and sent
a nice field goal across the Yale cross-
bar, making 3 points.
In the second period Yale got a
touchdown the first touchdown, by
the way, that Yale has made against
Harvard in nine years,
Harry Legore, the big Yale right
halfback, started to hit the line on a
play directed Just off the end. He
fumbled the ball. It dropped forward
play directed Just of f the end. He fum
bled the ball. It dropped forward and
rolled to Harvard's 13-yard line, with
Yale left tackle, flung himself on the
oval and held It, and ilt was Yale's
ball. .
With only 13 yards to go. the Yale
team gathered Itself for a supreme ef
fort, while the stands went wild with
excitement The Yale quarter called
for short, driving plays, taking no
chances on risky maneuvers. Two or
three yards at a time, Yale battered
the ball across the Harvard line. Goal
was missed and the score stood 6 to 3.
' The touchdown was made by Left
Half Neville.
Yale Resorts to Punting Game
In the third and fourth periods Yale
adopted a punting game, particularly
in the last session, to keep the ball
In Harvard territory. Once in the
third period, when Yale for a while
started to carry the ball down the
field, another score for the Blue
seemed probable. Harvard stif

Over $700 was realized today in
the initial pencil selling campaign
conducted by the Honolulu Hos
pital Flower Society. Not one
of the total stock of 7000 black
and gold striped crayons re
mained this afternoon and Mrs.
Alonzo Gartley said that three
limes as many could have been
sold. At least 10 cents was giv
en for every pencil although sev
eral donated without taking one
and many paid more than a dime
for the little offering, which bore
the inscrijition, "Remember the
Honolulu Hospital Flower Soci
ety." Over 50 women and girls
were at work and many were dis
appointed because the supply of
pen?ils was exhausted so soon. .
