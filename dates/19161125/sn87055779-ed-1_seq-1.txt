M. Sturcmcr. who has now Leen

succeeded M. Sazonoff us foreign
minister.
lu'.eruutioual News Service:
COl'RNHAORN, Nov. 25. Polit
ical unrest in Russia has reached an
acute -stage. That the government
bus become alarmed by the wide
spread discontent is shown by the
fact that it gave way before the
popular clamor and retired I'remier
.Sturcmer, replacing him by M.
Trepoff, an acknowledged progres
sive and reformer. Advices receiv
ed here today from Petrograd state
that a complete reorganization of
the Russian ministry is possible, in
iew of the insistent demands of the
radicals among the liberals, demo
crats ami laborites.
The Russian government blames
this unrest upon the "unseen hand."
It is charged that secret agents, in
the pay of Oermany, are mainly
responsible for the discontent.
There have recently been rumors
of revolutionary outbreaks in Petro
grad, Moscow, Kharkoff and other
important cities. It is oHieially
denied in Petrograd that such out
breaks have taken place, the home
otlice atiributirg the rumors of up
risings to the same agents who are
spreading discontent among the la
boring classes and farm workers.
Travellers just arriving here from
Russia say that the military ollicers
are utilizing the utmost precautions
in all the big cities. Strong gar
risons are maintained everywhere.
One of the main causes of anti
government activity in Russia, it
said, is the misery caused by the
food shortage, the lack of fuel, the
high prices of all necessities, the
ruthlessness of the military auth
orities in recruiting fresh arm
ies and other kinds of suffering iru
posed by the war.
That a widespread movement for
oeace has developed in IiussLa is
evident, although the Russian cen
sor is careful to see that, if it is
mentioned in dispatches at all. it is
handled in a way to hide Its grow
ing strength.

Lines in the great legal battle be
tween air lost a million organized
railroad workers on one side and
the organized power of railroad
capital on the other are rapidly
drawing close, with the legality of
the Adamson eight-hour day as the
immediate issue. And here are the
men who will figure most promin
ently in what promises to be one of
the greatest and most historic legal
battles in the history of industrial'
ism in America.
Rep. W. C. Adamson of Georgia,
chairman of the house committee on
interstate and foreign commerce, is
the father of the Adamson act
making an eight-hour day compul
sory on the railroads of the coun
try, and which act is generally
credited. Resides having prevented a
general strike of railroad workers,
with having done much to re-elect
Pres't Wilron.
Sen. Fr&ncis Newlands of Nevada,
is presiding over the hearings of the
joint committee of congress author
ized to investigate existing railroad
conditions. He announced at the
opening session that the wage ques
tion wouli be thoroughly investi
gated in order that congress might
substitute for "brute force and
strikes, the most barbaric and bru
tal of processes, lawful and orderly
methods of arranging differences be
tween men and managers."
Samuel Rea is president of the
Pennsylvania railroad and one of
the leaden; among the railroad man
agers who are contesting the legal
ity of the Adamson law.
W. S. Carter and Warren S. Stone
are two of the leading four chiefs
of the railroad brotherhoods. These
two. together with W. H. Lee and
I E. Sheppard, the four chiefs,
brought about the enactment of the
Adamson law shortly before Pres't
Wilson's re-election by taking a
vote of railroad men which resulted
in a decision to strike on all rail
roads unless an eight-hour day was
obtained.
