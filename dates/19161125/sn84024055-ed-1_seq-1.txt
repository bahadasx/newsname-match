CHICAGO, NOVEMBER 25, 1916
N. 10
The Afro-Ameriqan Editors Throughout the Country Are
Still Harping on the Shabby Treatment Which They
Received at the Hands of the Republican National
Committee in Being Turned Down Cold in the Way of
Receiving Advertising x
IjfJLST OF THEM CONTEND THAT THE GRANDMLD PAETY CAN
HEVEB WIN A NATIONAL VICTORY AS LONG AS IT FAVORS THE
POLICY OF IGNORING- THE COLORED NEWSPAPERS THAT WHEN
IT WAS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED IN POWER IT FAILED TO ENFORCE
THE FEDERAL ELECTION LAWS IN THE SOUTHERN STATES;
THAT THEY WINKED AT THE DISFRANCHISING MEASURES IN
rOECE IN MANY OF THOSE STATES WITH NO OTHER OBJECT IN
VIEW THAN TO STRIKE AT THB CIVIL AND POLITICAL RIGHTS
OF THE NEGRO.
THAT FOR FORTY YEARS OR MORE THEY TAUGHT THE NEGRO
HOW TO FIGHT AND OPPOSE THE DEMOCRATS AT EVERY TURN
IN THE ROAD AND THEN THEY THE LEADERS OF THE REPUB
LICAN PARTY TURNED AROUND AND MADE FRIENDS WITH
THESE SAME DEMOCRATS AND LEFT THE NEGRO HANGING HIGH
AND DEY COMPELLING HIM TO SHUFFLE FOR TTTMSET.F AS BEST
HE COULD OUT IN THE COLD.
from all over this country the Afro-
I Amman editors are still engaged in
f iirpiig on the raw deal and the
f iiibbj treatment which they received
lit tie bands of the head chiefs of
I tie Republican National Committee,
iunv of the editors contend that at
io time in the past have they been
extended the cold marble heart like
nto the past presidential election
tht in all previous presidential con
tests they received their share of the
ilvertising which had always caused
tlem to work very hard for the suc
tess of the national ticket.
Brother Charles Sumner Smith, Ed
itor of tlie Twin City Star, St. Paul
ml IDnneapolis, Minn., gives expres
sion to tie following in relation to
the treatment of the Colored news
paper men, and he brands it as a
most "Damnable Situation."
"It is deplorable that the Negro Ad
visory Committee of the Republican
National Committee, was unable to get
together iu their initial meeting at
w York. They raised so much hell,
ltt the election of a chairman, that
. Herbert Parsons, state committee-
had to preside.
"The attitude of some of the big
fVocs at Chicago, has been openly

PTe the public a reminder of many

est among Colored voters. They met'
in New York, having had their ex
penses paid and liberally, too, for their
trip to the metropolis. They met and
adjourned, giving out the information
that a little jim-crow annex had been
established in New York by them."
The Informer, Cadiz, Ky., has this
to say respecting the defeat of Hon.
Charles E. Hughes for president of the
United States.
"The reason for our defeat may be
attributed to several causes. We think
however, the chief reason, the Repub
lican party failed to heed the warning
of the Colored Press which was not
able to conduct an advertising scheme
which would enable it to bring out the
full strength of the Colored vote. As
the Colored Press represents neariy one
and one half million Colored readers.
But the appeal was ignored, and we are
to suffer another four years of hard
times that might have been avoided
if the Bcpublican Managers had dis
played sufficient foresight and tact.
The Colored Press was in position to
serve the party in this case handsomely
but it was not able to finance a cam
paign at its own expense."
It is also contended by many of the
Colored editors in all parts of this
country that the Bcpublican party will
never be able to win another national
victory as long as its leaders favor the
policy of absolutely ignoring the Col
ored newspapers, moreover, that when
it was firmly entrenched in power
throughout the land it utterly failed to
enforce the federal election laws in
the southern states; that they, the
head leaders of the Republican party
winked at the disfranchising laws which
have been enacted by tho legislatures
of many of the southern states, with no
object in view than to curtail tho civil
and political rights of the Negro.
Some few of tho brave and inde
pendent Colored editors are also letting
it be known that for more than forty
years the high priests of the Bcpubli
can party have moro than successfully
taught tho Negro how to fight and
bitterly opposo the Democrats at every
turn in the road that at the same
timo they the leaders of tho Repub
lican party havo been turning around
and making friends with those same
Democrats appointing many of them
to high and responsible positions
leaving the Negro hanging high and
dry thereby forcing him to shufflo
early and late out in tho cold.

BRB3F BITS OF NEWS AND COM
MENT ON MEN AND WOMEN
Educational Results Shown at Negro
Fair
Memphis, Tenn. What applied edu
cation is doing for the Negro in Ten
nessee is illustrated by the displays in
the exposition hall at the annual fair
for Colored people. The most striking
of all the displays are those showing
work done in the Negro schools.
Dresses, hats, quilts, table covers and
other practical examples of needlework
are shown by the Negro girls. Bread,
cake, canned fruit and vegetables, as
well as drawings, paintings and applied
designs such as for window curtains
complete tho list: The tools, such as
.chavs, jjMok-xackSyJbenches 'and similar
pieces, of furniture.
Several excellent agricultural exhibits
shown by individual entrants attract
much attention. Corn, long staple cot
ton, grasses, small grains and garden
products show what the Negroes are do
ing in an agricultural way. One of tho
best collections of farm and garden
products is that shown by a woman far
mer who is an annual exhibitor. Plants
and flowers grown by a Negro florist,
jewelry made by a Negro craftsman
and many other examples of work are
among the varied displays. More than
a score of horses from the farm of a
Negro are exhibited.
SOME "POOR RELATIONS"
Washington, D. C "There are 19
states which are now under prohibition
law; they have 30,000,000 population
and $46,000,000,000 of wealth; they re
ceived larger per capita appropriations
from Congress last year than did the li
censed states, but they paid less than
$50,000,000 of the $513,000,000 which
the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
collected in t;ho fiscal year ended June
30, 1916. In other words, these 19 pro
hibition states, with nearly one-third
of the population and one-fourth of the
total wealth of the United States, paid
less than one-tenth of the revenue for
tho support of the Federal government.
The other 70,000,000 people in 29 states
which do not have prohibition, paid
$463,000,000, or nine-tenths of the to
tal revenue to meet these extraordinary
appropriations for tho benefit of tho
prohibition states. The per capita col
lections were $1.66 in prohibition states
and $6.62 in the non-prohibition states.
The tax on wealth amounted to $1.09
on each $1,000 in prohibition states and
$3.28 on each $1,000 of wealth in non
prohibition states.
"-The new taxes now imposed by
Congress are paid in tho same propor
tion. The 19 prohibition states paid
$8,000,000 of the $84,000,000 emergency
revenue raised bystamp taxes, taxes
on business and amusements. That tax
amounted to 27 cents per capita or 17
cents on each $1,000 of wealth in the
prohibition states. The pcoplo in tho
non-prohibition states paid $1.09 per
capita or a tax of 54 cents on each
$1,000 of wealth under the head of
emergency revenue. That was four
times the tax rato levied on tho per
sons and wealth in tho non-prohibition
states over the rate paid in tho prohi
bition states. .
"The prohibition states paid $3,000,
000 of the $68,000,000 collected under
the head of income tax. That was 10
cents per capita, or 7 cents on each
$1,000 of wealth. The 70,000,000 peo
ple in the 29 non-prohibition states
paid $65,000,000 incorao tax, which was
93 cents per capita or 47 cents on eacn

in the non-prohibition states was nine
times and tho tax on wealth five times
that in the prohibition states.

ANNUAL ELECTION OF OFFICERS
OF THE APPOMATTOX CLUB
Saturday evening December 2, the
annual election of officers of the Appo
mattox Club will be held in the parlors
of the club, 3441 South Wabash ave
nue. The following are the leading
candidates for the various offices:
For president, S. . T. Watkms. Col.
J. II. Johnson; for first vice-president,
David A. McGowan; for second vice

cial secretary, Howard F. Corn well;

bo elected, M. C. Cowan, Joseph H.
Brent, Gcorgo H. Jackson, A. L. Jones,
D. Manson, J. L. Slaughter.
"F6r our part, we never would record
our vote in favor of the Hon. Henry
S. Anderson for treasurer, for he is ono
of those short-sighted or narrow-minded
individuals who entertains the idea
that nowspaper men should be crushed
down or out that they should not be
permitted to give expression to their
honest views or convictions or adhere
to the absolute truth while engaged in
writing in relation to any important
event, and we honestly feel that any
man who is incapable of conducting
some line of business for himself, be it
ever so small, has no moral right to
aspire to handle the mone or funds
belonging to other successful business
men.
