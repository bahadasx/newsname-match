Bandit Attacks.
El Paso, Nov. 24. -Francisco Villa
withdrew surviving forces in. defeat
from Chihuahua city at 6:15 o'clock
last night after a battle of seven hours,
during which he made fruitless at
tempts to carry Gen. Trevino's pro
tecting works by assault, according to
reports from Juarez.
Three separate attacks have been
made upon the Carranza forces by
the Villa forces from the south, ac
cording to fi'n. Gonzales. These at
tacks have been repulsed according
to the same source and the Villa
losses have been extremely heavy,
the message says.
Gen. Trevino's artillery which car
ried the brunt of the attack, did
heavy execution in the ranks of the
bandits, according to the message,
Gen. Gonzales said he had received
from the state capital. Many Villa
prisoners were taken by the Carranza
forces when a detachment of infantry
and cavalry made a sally from the
city, he said.
Carranza's officers here are opti
mistic regarding the outcome of the
battle at Chihuahua city. The only
cause of worry to them is the fact
that Gen. Trevino's ammunition sup
ply for small arms and machine guns
is limited. However the supply of
artillery shells is ample, it is said
here, to keep the bandits away from
the city.

THE CREED OF THE
SPECULATOR IN FOOD.
This is an interesting and no doubt a
true story which comes out of Chica
go in connection with the investiga
tion that the government is making of
tho present high prices of foodstuirs.
Ccrlain speculators in farm prod
ucts, it is said, have purposely per
mitted tramloads of sound stuff to rot
in tho fields or be condemned and de
stroyed as unsound after having been
removed from the place of produc
tion. This, it is alleged, was done in
order to reduce the visible supply
and increase the price on the stock in
storage to an extraordinary degree.
It is nls i found that millions of doz
ens of egtis have been bought up by
speculators at prices, from 10 to
24 cents ; dozen and deposited in cold
storage v.: rehouses, from which they
are now In ing sold at 40 to 50 cents a
dozen.
Obviously, it would be difficult for
the government to pass a law that
would seriously intcrforc with the
freedom of buying and selling in the
onon market, and it would no doubt
be unwise to do this even if it could
be done and stand the tests of the
courts, and yet it is evident that in the
course or time tne government win
be compelled to resort to some means
to prevent tho speculator from levy
ing outrageous taxes on the public.
When one remembers that the av
erage family income in the United
States, in normal times, is about SOO
a year, and that hundreds of thous
ands of families must live on from
$500 to $G00 a year, the burden which
this speculation in food places upon
the people can easily be appreciated
by those who have anything like ad
equate knowledge of the hardships
that excessive food prices impose
upon the ordinary consumer.
The practice of depositing food
stuffs in cold storage also oilers a
problem difficult tosolvc. The cold
sforace warehouse, primarily, is a
blessing to mankind, and yet, unfor
tunately, like many other great gifts
to humanity, it may be utilized by
evil men to the detriment of all. By
means of the cold storage warehouse,
foodstuffs of all sorts, when plentiful,
may be preserved until the surplus is
consumed, and, properly managed,
the cold storage depot could be so
used that the price of food would be
lessened rather than increased, be
cause through it the volume which
may be carried beyond the point
where it would spoil may be limited
only by the capacity of the storage
' plants.
' She conscienceless speculator, how
i ever, aided by the cold storage pro-
j cess, and with unlimited means at his
; command, buys up the surplus farm
and garden stuff, eggs, fruits, fowls
and holds them until scarcity compels
the consumer to offer unheard of
prices for these things. The rich and
the comfortably well-to-do know little
of the hardships which this swindling
process imposes upon the humble
! wage aimer and the small salaried
man, and the speculator is permitted
to enrich himself at the expense of
i victims whose complaints are not far
reaching.
! This condition, however, cannot
'endure forever. The people usually
find ways to correct positive abuses,
even though it may be necessary to
..suspend temporarily some of the fix
ed rules and laws of trade, and if the
I government cannot find some remedy
in .existing laws, other means will bo
' discovered and apjlied. The key to
; the situation is to be found in the cold
i storage warehouse. It may.be possi'
My, by placing a tremendously heavy
tax upon goods stored beyond fixed
periods, to compel the speculators to
place ibeui upon the market in such
quantities and at such times as to pre'
vent "corners" and extortion.
At the same time, the ingenuity of
greed and avarice lias nearly always
been equal to the opportunities which
offer themselves to evil men to take
advantage of tho helpless, and the
people, if they secure relief, must get
it through the services of public serv
ants possessing high qualities of states
manship and a patriotic desire to
servo humanity to the fullest.
We talk much about tho cruelty
practiced upon tho battlefields of
France and in tho villages and towns
of Belgium and Serbia, and keep our
yes blind to the pitable hardships in-

That Work On the Dover
Road Is Moving Too
' Slowly.
CONTRACTOR GETS BUSY
And It Is Believed the Bad
Places Will Be Qeickly
Improved.
At a meeting of the County Road
Commission Thursday a number of
citizens appeared before the Commis
sion and entered complaints in regard
to the condition of several roads in
the county, due to the construction
work now going on by the contrac
tors, Montgomery, Perkins & Co. Mr.
Perkins was present and the confer
ence resulted in steps being taken to
hurry up the work on the Dover road,
which is in the worst condition. Sev
eral changes of grade have not ltn
metnled yet and the road is in no condi
tion for winter hauling. Mr. Perkins
has shifted forces from other roads
to this one and the work will be push
ed more rapidly. The matter was
presented to the Commission by
Messrs. James West and R. E. Coop
er. The Madisonville road is blocked,
but plans are being made to get it
opened soon. Work is progressing
nicely on the Elkton road and there
are no serious complaints on otner
roads.
An agreement has been made by
which a bad hill on the Cadiz road
this side of SUiloh church will be im
proved at once.
Inspector Vessels, who has been
looking after the work here, has been
relieved and C. A. Ligon will suc
ceed him. Mr. Ligon is the inspector
who looked after the contract work
done by Mr. McQueary last season.
