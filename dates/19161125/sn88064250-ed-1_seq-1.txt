GINNERS' REPORT SHOWS
INCREASE FOR PARISH
St. Landry and Evangeline Make
Big Jump in Production
of Cotton in 1916
The cotton gin report issued by
the bureau of the census of the
department of agriculture shows
that the state of Louisiana pro
duoed in 1916, up to November 8,
365,797 bales, as compared with
271,398 bales total for 1915. Of the
number of bales reported of the
present crop St. Landry parish
shows 19,351 compared with 11,746
last year, while Evangeline is cred
ited with 11,220, compared with
7,042 last year-a tremendous in
crease in both parishes and when
it is considered that the price re
ceived by the farmers for both cot
ton and seed was a great deal high
er than last season the present
prosperity of the agriculturists of
this section is not to be wondered
at.

Andrew Daniel Gonsoulin
Died, at the family residence, on
East North street in this city, on
last Wednesday night at 7:25
o'clock, Andrew Daniel Gonsoulin,
aged 14 years, and i day. The
funeral was held from the family
residence Thursday afternoon at
4 o'clock with services at the
Catholic church and interment in
the Catholic cemetery.
The deceased was the son of Mr.
and Mrs. Edmond Gonsoulin and
considered one of the brightest
pupils in the Opelousas high school.
Stricken with a fatal illness just
as he was getting well started on
the road of life, his death is indeed
a sad blow to father, mother,
brothers, sisters and school friends.
His remains were followed to their
last resting place by a large con
course and many an eye was
dimmed with tears when the solemn
but simple ceremonies were enacted
and his mortal remains consigned
to Mother Earth. The Clarion
joins the unmerous friends of Mr.
and Mrs. Gonsoulin in tendering
sympathies for their loss.

William Lendl~ne Mornhinveg
This community was shocke I
Tuesday night, when the news
was circulated that William Le
moine Mornhinveg, better known
as "Hill" to his friends and as
sociates, had passed away. His
death came as a sudden surprise
for few knew that he was ill for
he had been up and about just
the day before his death. Mr.
Mornhinveg was the youngest
son of John Mornhinveg of this
city and a grandson of the late
Dr. James Ray and was 34 years,
5 months and 21 days of age. The
funeral cortege left the home of
his brother-in-law, Arthur A.
Comeau, at 3 p. m. Wednesday.
Services were held at the Catho

public cemetery besides the re
mains of many of his departed
kinsmen. The Clarion tenders
its condolences to the relatives of
the deceased.
CONNECTINh LINK ANI I
MAYBE BI HilGHWAY
Evangeline Road Seems a Certainty
and May Result in Securing
Jefferson Highway
CHAIRMAN GRACE IS BUSY
WORKING TO THAT END
Appoints Committees. Along Line of
Progected Route, from Bun
kie to Lafayette
From pine to palm, from the
forzen regions of the north to the
sunny climes of the south, from
Canada to Louisiana, from Winn
ipeg to New Orleans, is what the
great Jefferson Highway means.
To let slip the opportunity of
having such a highway pass
through our section would be a
crime against its people. To se
cure such a route will mean
prosperity and progress.
This is why the people of St.
Landry are being asked to meet
in Opelousas on December 14 name
ly to wake up to the wondrous
opportunity now at their aoor.
Every effort means success; to
stand idly by, failure.
Come on, fellow citizens, and
help us secure the passing througn
our parish of this great highway.
As was well said by Mr. Pope of
Bunkie, at the recent meeting, "Tis
not an assured fact that the lngn
way will pass through our section;
hence it is up to the people to get
busy and make it do so."
The people of the central north
want to get to New Orleans on a
tourist route. They must come
through Louisiana, striking the
state just above Shreveport. It is
a matter of vital importance that
they reach New Orleans by the
right way. This will be on the
west side of the Mississippi, and
it is up to us to show by facts and
figures that the logical route is
through Alexandria, Bunkie, Opel
ousas and Lafayette.
Chariman Grace of the recently
organized Evangeline Highway
Association has appointed the
Ifollowing committees to get in
touch with their various sections
anr to arouse the necessary en
thusiasm to secure this great
highway:
Opelousas-Hon. E. B. Dubuisson,
Dr. J. A. Haas, Dr. C. F. Boagni,
Bunkie-Dr. E. A. Matthews, Mr.
R. D. Neibert, Mr. C. J. Pope, Mr.

Chariman Grace of the associa
lion was an Opelousas visitor last
Tuesday afternoon and while in
this city gave The Clarion a cali.
He stated that he was devoting
much of his time to the work of
securing the highway for St.
Landry, notwithstanding the fact
that his duties as president of St.
Charles College at Grand Coteau
required much of his time. It
was plain to note that he is a good
booster and fully intends to devote
his tremendous energy and great
ability in securing the big highway
for this section. It would seem,
from his conversation, that instead
of being satisfied with a connecting
link betweeen the Jefferson and
Spanish Trail Highways, he is
determined to secure the Jefferson
Highway itself.
The Jefferson Highway, as pro
jected through Louisiana, would
touch Bunkie and from that point
go toward Melville and Baton
Rouge and on to New Orleans.
The Spanish Trail would follow
more closely the line of the
Southern Pacific railroad and, pass
ing Lafayette, go westward toward
the Pacific coast. The Evangeline
Highway is a projected link be
tween these two great trunk lines,
touching one at Bunkie, the other
at Lafayette. But it is Chairman
:race's evident intention of going
after the main line of the Jefferson
and bringing it right through the
heart of St. Landry parish and let
it connect at Lafayette with the
Spanish Trail road. Ip the event,

COLLEGE JUNIORS ARE
VICTORS IN GAME
St. Charles Team Defeats the
Lafayette Aggregation by
Score of 60 to 0
Grand Coteau, La., Nov. 20.- The
Junior football team of St. Charles
College had very little trouble in
walking all over The Outlaws of
Lafayette, in a game played on the
college campus Sunday afternoon.
Never was the goal of the locals
in any serious danger. In kicking,
running and passing the college
boys were easily in the lead as the
territory of the visitors. They
made first down only four times,
twice owing to long runs of 35
and 48 yards by the fullback,
Buchanan. He was easily the star
for Lafayette, but owing to the
fact that he received little support
he was stopped by the hard tackl
ing of Smith and Billeaud of St.
Charles. The college has the mak
ing of a fine team in a couple of
years if the combination of juniors
which met the Lafayette boys hold
together long enough. Smith, Cook
and the two ·Billeauds were the
stars. However, they were hard
pressed for the honors by at least
seven other St. Charles players.

ST. CHARLES PRESIDENT
A VISITOR TUESDAY
Rev. Father Grace of Grand Co
teau Tells of Institu
tion's Progress
Rev. Father Grace, S. J., of
Grand Coteau, president of the St.
Charles College, was in Opelousas
last Tuesday afternoon and gave
this office an appreciated visit.
Father Grace stated that the
college was progressing finely and
that the enrollment this session
exceeded that of last year and bid
fair to increase more and more
each succeeding session. The work
is going right along, without a
hitch, and St. Charles stood in a
fair way of again attaining its
place as one of the leading educa
tional institutions, of the state.
This noted school, which has as
its graduates many of the leading
men of the state, has suffered
several times from disastrous fires
and after being dormant for a
number of years was again rebuilt.
The building is one of the finest
and largest in Louisiana devoted
exclusively to education and was
constructed at a big cost. Under
the wise tutorship of the Jesuit
fathers St. Charles is rapidly forg
ing to the frontt.
--:o:-
--Mrs. Boagni returned from
New Orleans during the week ac
companied by Dr. Shute and Dr.
Littell her many friends will be
delighted to know that she will
soon be in their midst again.
however, that this meets with
failure, the new association can
drop back on the original proposi
tion of building the already propos
ed connecting link.
This in itself would r:,ult i;
, uch good to thu ixmme.li t. -
tion as many tourists going south
would diverge at Bunkie and come
through this section. Others going
north from New Orleans would
come over the Spanish Trail to
Lafayette and come through here.
The entire project is unquestion
ably a big one but as much has
already been accomplished in the
matter of constructing the two
main highways, especially the Jef
ferson, the completion of that road
seems to be a certainty in the near
future. It remains, therefore, for
his section of St. Landry, as well as
our neighbor, Lafayette. to get
busy and try and construct t-ither
a part of the main line or the pro
p,sed connecting link.
"LONi SWEETENING"
IN lHEAT QUANTITIES
Crockett & Weill's Big Syrup Mill
Turning Out Product of
Louisiana Cane
THOUSANDS OF GALLONS
YET TO BE SHIPPED
Several Weeks of. Steady Running
Before Season Closes, Which
Has Been Successful
A representative of this news
paper, accompanied by several
friends made a brief trip last Tues
day noon to the big cane syrup
mill of Crockett and Weill, located
about four miles southwest of the
city. We were cordially received
by both Mr. Crockett, who is on
the ground actively superintending
operations, and by several of his
assistants.
The mill is the plant of the old
Upelousas Sugar Company, which
lay idle several years until bought
in by the enterprising Alexandria
wholesale grocery firm some
months ago. The new owners im
mediately began the work of re
pairing and otherwise improving
the mill and also installed a modern
canning apparatus. Work for the
season began on Monday, October
23, and since that date the
machinery has been going night
and day with the exception of Sun
days. They employ quite a number
of men and the payroll amounts to
several thousands of dollars each
month. Most of the cane being
ground is shipped to the mill from
other points, only about five
hundred tons being brought in by
local farmers. A spur track of the
Texas and Pacific road runs up to
the mill from the main track,
some distance further, and on the
day the newspaper representative
was there several cars of cane were
ready for unloading.
In addition, another track runs
up to the loading platform at the
warehouse apld it is an easy matter
to load a car with the finished
product. The warehouse is a
sight to behold, in that it is orderly
packed with cases of canned syrup,
properly labelled and ready for
the breakfast table. The cases
are mostly of the six-gallon size
that is they contain six one-gallon
cans. However, the syrup is also
placed in other sizes of containers
two and three-gallons, and Mr.
Crockett explained that the most
of their trade was in the gallon
size, there being little demand for
the halves. quarts and pints.
It is plain to see that there is
no lost motion around the big mill
and everything runs like clockwork.
Each man has his job and he at
tends to his particular duties. The
machinery is in good repair and
runs with out a hitch. The cane
goes into the the giant rollers at one
end of the building and the syrup
is canned, labelled and packed for
shipment at the other end. The
"barasse" is fed direct into the
furnace under the giant boiler.
thus assistinr in the raisinr of
power for the operation of the
machinery and saving quite an
item in the fuel bill.
Messrs. Crockptt and Weill have
been engaged for several years in
buying large quantities of syrup
from other producers and selling
same under their own name. This
season is their first attempt to
produce the syrup themselves.
They realized quite a time ago
the desirability of operating a
plant in the "de land where de
sugar cane grows," and when they
were offered the local mill they
bought it without any loss of
time. This season's run is in the -
nature of an experiment but the 1
next season they expect to handle
a large 'tonnage and produce a
greater quantity of syrup.
Mr. Crockett presented us with
a generous sample of syrup and
it measures up, in quality and
appearance, with the best in the
land. The most of their trade, Mr.
Crockett explained, was in the
states of Arkansas, Kansas, Texas,
Oklahoma and New Mexico, though
they had made some small ship
ments to other states in the west.
He stated that the greatest trouble
they experienced was in localitieg
where the adulterated "Louisiana
cane syrup" blackstrap and glucose
had already prejudiced the people
with the product of the Louisiana
open kettle syrup, which is all
syrup and not a mixture. The
blackstrap molasses of commerce
the by-product of the sugar re
finery and almost depleted of its
original sugar content There is
to comparison with the open i
ettle kind as this latter, as all
ere know, contains everything
rom the cane.

[HREE NEW FIRMS ARE
INCORPORATED HERE
Picture Show, Bennett Stores
and the Roos Company Be
gin Business
Elsewhere in this issue of The
Mlarion appear the charters uf 4
three new corporations recenltly
ormed in this city-the Opelou
;as Motion Picture Company, the
Bennett Stores and the Roos
Dompany, the two latter taking
>ver old established business in
;titutions and continuing the
;ame in their present locations,
while the first named is an entire
!y new concern which starts out
with a vim amost uprecedented in
this city.
The Bennett Bargain Store,
ne of Opelousas' long-establish
ýd and most successful mercantile
establishments, has been changed
into a stock company under the
name of "The Bennett Stores, In
sorporated," of which B. Bennett
is president, but the active man
igement will be conducted by E.
(. Eastham as manager and Fred
F. Hollier as vice president. Both
these latter gentlemen are too well
known in Opelousas and the par
ish at large to need introduction.
Mr. Eastham was a merchant for
ten years in Kentucky before
moving to Opelousas, since which
time he has become so well and
favorably known to the people
of St. Landry that he was elected
as one of - our representatives,
which position he now occupies.
Mr. Hollier has been with the
Bennett eastablishment for many
years and is probably the best
known clothing salesman in the
parish. The new-old concern
will occupy the same stand on
East Landry street. Mr. Ben
nett will continue active in the
buying departmenlt. MessrO.
Eastham and Hollier state to the
friends of the Bennett Bargain
House and to their own friends
that the policy of the Bennett
Stores, Incorp'orated, will follow
out largely those of the old Ben
nett business-that of giving the
utmost values, service and cour
tesy for the least money. In ad
dition they state that in a short
time the line of merchandise here
tofore caried by Mr. Bennett will
be largely broadened so as to in
clude a complete line of house
hold drygoods and ladies' ready
to-wear garments. The Clarion
takes occasion to welcome the
Bennett Stores, Incorporated,
and to wish full measure of suc
cess to the gentlemen composing
same.
The other new mercantile firm,
the Roos Company, Limited, also
absorbs an old established busi
ness, The, Opelousas Mercantile
Company, which has been in con
tinuous existence for over a quar
ter of a century. Isaac Roos, the
present head of the old company,
along with his sons and his broth
er-law, Isadore Isaac, are the
members of the new firm and,
having had much experience in
the business, are eminently fitted
to continue the business now tak
en over. Isaac Roos has been
identified with mercantile estab
lishments in this city since his
early boyhood and has long been
recognized as a leader in that line
of trade. He is well and favor
ably known by every farmer in
this parish and, besides engaging
in the business of selline mer
chandise, has also bought and
shipped cotton in this territory
for years. He is known as "the
farmer's friend" in all such
transactions and every farmer
who has sold him cotton banks
on Ike Roos and his well-known
business integrity. With the re
juvenation and the injecting o:
new blood into the old Mercantile
Company this old-new firm also
starts out under favorable cir
eumstances and conditions and
The Clarion wishes it, too, full
measure of success in its chosen
field.
The Opelousas Motion Picture
Company is composed of a long
list of stockholders, every one of
whom has an abiding faith in its
future and a firm belief that it
will be a succeess from the very
jump. With such men as Frank
J. Dietlein and Dr. J. A. Shaw as
the heads of the new company it
is bound to succeed. The
company has entered into a con
tract with Mrs. Win. Dejean who

EXTENSIVF REPAIRS
FUR IUG (ilNNERY
Barnett & Stelly Start Preparing
for Cotton Season
for 1917
LATEST IMPROVED MACHINERY
ORDERED FOR THE PLANT
Old Equipment to be Discarded at
Once and Gin Will Handle
More Cotton
The old Hyman- Hiller gin in
this city, long reconized as being
one of the best in the state and
which some time ago passed into
the ownership of Simon Stelly and
Jesse Barnett and associates, is to
be thoroughly modernized for the
coming season.
To that end, according to an in
terview had with Mr. Stelly, the
very latest and most modern
machinery has been ordered and
work in repairing and renewing
the plant will be begun at once.
The old plant, including the gin
stand, will be displaced and the
very fastest gin stands of the
greatest capacity will be put in for
next season.
The press will also be the most
modern and will be equipped with
a self-packer of the latest type
which will remove much of the
present labor of packing the gin
ned cotton in the press previous
to baling.
The season just ended has been
a successful one with the owners of
the plant and they propose to make
and successful. Some months ago,
and just previous to the opening
of the season, the plant was
electrified, the entire machinery
being driven by electric motors of
high horse power. Mr. Stelly states
that the cost of this operation, on
a contract with the city, was thirty
cents per bale for electric current
and that he and his partners are
thoroughly satisfied with the low
cost of the service and expect to
continue to be the largest users
of current in this city--that is,
during the ginning season. They
find that the use of electricity is
not only economical but safe and
quick. There is almost no danger
from fire and it is possible for
them to operate the plant twenty
four hours out of each day with
out bucking up against the protests
of the insurance companies. Also,
when there is no cotton in sight
or on the yards the plant can be
closed down temporarily and still
be ready for business with an in
stant's warning. This is a step in
advance as compared with the old
steam power gins and the owners
of the this modern plant are to be
congratulated on their foresighted
ness in looking to the possible de
mands of the future for a modern
ginnery which can keep pace with
the number of bales of cotton re
oeived by it.
Mr. Stelly, by birth a St. Land
rian, has been a resident of this
city for a number of years and dur
ing the entire time has been
actively engaged in the cotton
business and is thoroughly equipped
to handle the gin the very best
manner possible. He is the active
manager of the ownership and, be
ing well acquainted throughout this
entire section, his management is
sufficient guarantee to all cus
tomers and prospective customers
of being treated in a befitting
manner.
