Atlantic City, Nov. 23.—Represent
atives of the de facto government
and the United States came to an
agreement today relative to the han­
dling of iborder matters.
The plan as finally determined fol
lows closely that outlined 'by- Presi
dent Wilson some time ago.
Its Terms.
The agreement provides:
First—The American troops now in
Chihuahua, commanded by General
John J. Pershing, styall he withdrawn
within 40 days from the approval of
the protocol by the respective gov
ernments, provided that within that
time the conditions in that ipart of
Mexico have not 'become such as. to
endanger the American border. In
such event the time shall be extend­
ed.
Second—The Mexican army shall
patrol the Mexican side of the border
and the American army the Ameri
can side, but this shall not preclude
co-operation between the two forces
to preserve peace upon the border.
Left to Commanding Officers.
Third—It shall'be left to the com­
manding officers of the armies on the
border of both armies to enter into,
such arrangements for co-operation
in operations against taindltg when
«ftwit*lar prtJSifrble.
The right of American government
to send troops across the border in
pursuit of bandits was not incorpor­
ated in the protocol, hut was made
tbe subject of a supplemental mem
orandum.
Opposed Violation of Country.
The Mexicans had contended, earn*
estly against signing any agreement
in Which they appeared to sanctttm
what- they termed the violation of
their national territory. It was the
agreement of the Americans finely
to content themselves with stating
the attitude of the United States in
a separate memorandum that induced
the Mexicans to sign the agreement.
Villa and Carranza stood in the
way of an earlier agreement being
reached between the United States
and the heads of the Mexican de facto
government.
Villistas are making a three-sided
assault on Chihuahua City, according
to a report reaching the United States
department agents. Counsel General
Carcia stated the message, telling of
the beginning of the third day's battle
had not yet reached him.
CRUCIAL STAGE.
•131 Paso, Texas, Nov. 25.—Reports
reaching the United States govern­
ment here indicate that the crucial
stage in the momentous battle for the
possession of Chihuahua City had
been reached.

clothes caught fire, severely burning the little celebrant. When
the condition of the child became acute a neighbor by the name of
Sullivan was the first to volunteer.

Kansas City, Mo., Nov. 25—
Gov­
ernment ownership of ^railroads was
discussed here by Charles A. Prouty,
in charge of the interstate commerce
coipinispion valuation of railroad
properties, and Carl'R. Gray, presi­
dent of the, Western Maryland rail­
road.,
"WeN have in this country a railroad
problem, because we are trying to dis­
charge governmental Junctions with
private capital," declared Mrs. Prou­
ty. "The railroad problem isn't any
nearer settled than it ,was when the
act to regulate commerce became a
law iback in 1887."
"In^ the railroad situation we are
confronted by four outstanding condi­
tions," .Mr. Gray said.
"These are: The practical stop­
page of railroad construction, the em­
bargoes on traffic, the car shortage
and the unpopularity of railroad in­
vestment.
"We all are aware that the situa­
tion is tor be canvassed before the
Newlands commission. We're going
to kdvocate the practical abolition of
the state in the making of a railroad
rate and we'll ask for national incor­
poration of railroads. Next we're in­
terested in the labor situation. The
greatest step this country ever has
taken toward government ownership
was the passage of the Adamson
eight-hour bill.

country's greatest milling center,
may be, forced to close down indefi­
nitely. Mills are now runityng only

age. It is admitted that closing the
mills would increase the flour short­
