the call is severely atfecfted, but
a the cane was rapidly put down

tinues cool there will Ibe very little
damage if any.

Auto Accident.
Sunday morning when young
l)niel Suard was returning home
from town with another young
companion in a Ford Car, he ran
in the deep ditch south of the Ca
nal bridge and demolished the car.
oitlh young men escaped without
injury which is almost incredible
after looking at the condition of
the wrecked car.
We can see no reason for an ac
cident of this kind on such good
roadl except careless speeding.

Last Saturday's result on the
Abbeville gridiron showed an ex
ceedingly fast game when the St.
Martinville High defeated the Ab
leville High to the sweet tune of
Sto 13. The St. Martinville team
went to Abbeville in full force with
the determination to scalp Abbe
ville. The Abbeville boys put up
a hard fight but at the end of the
fourth quarter the St. Martinville
boys were victors. The features
of the game were: a iO yard run
by H. Fournet when he intercep
ted a forward pass from Abbeville,
and made a touch-down; A. Lan
dry and W. Berard's long end runs;
J. Mayhall kicking goal; L. Mar
tin going through center for three
yards and making touch-down.
The team as a whole did exceed
ingly well in tackling and break
ing interference.j
The St. Martinville boys will
play Abbeville again here Friday
Nov. 24, 1916. The Abbeville ex
pect to wallop St. Martinville and
the St. Martinville boys expect to
smother Abbeville, therefore a
good fast game is expected.
The St. Martinville High will
close their foot-ball season in Mor
gan City on Turkey Day.
