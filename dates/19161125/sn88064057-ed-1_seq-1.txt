A Picture For Husbands.
Here is a picture which some hus
bends coujd study with advantage.
Many a man s ems to regard these
household duties of the wife as not to
',coaspared for a moment with those
'i .,... rois hig att'" idS. He tx
pt- . e... ,,Cess has p-erplered or made
blim ansnxus, to have his wife's sym
pathy when he comes home at night,
but sever imagines that during the day
anything could have occared to trouble
that wife. He returns from his work
shop or counting room soared, perhaps,
by some bead argains. annayed by a
stupid workman or unreasonable emplov
er, morose from some ill-spoken a ord,
and expects to be received with smiles;
it matters not how surly may be his
looks, his wife must be, in dress, in
countenance, in words, all sweetness
and amiability. He may have no pleas
ant word, may take his place moodily at
his table, but his wife's words must he
affeetionate, and his wife's loss fall
-oly of gladness. What, he tl:inks, has
she to trouble her?
The tea is dispatched silently, very
likely with somber comp!ints over the
trials he has had during the day. or the
doseess of the times; and then the
evening paper is taken in n a:il and
pored over until the very advertisements
are devoured. or the resder's face is
bowed upon the crumpled pagc in sleep.
Or if he be not weary enough for that
he seizes his hat and rushes. for the club
roonm or reading room, or more probably
dor the lounging piece where such as he
1. r rgregate: there, with the tragl:eint
of cigar in haned and desultory talk from
his ips, lhe lingers till the closing of the
shutters warns hims to leave. He goes
at last home again, because he can go
nowwhere else. Meanwhile the wife,
with a heavy heart and tired step. got
the little ones into bed, sand as best she
could, has worn away the long hours of
the evening in silence and loaeliness.
Should a thought of his selfishness or
onjustice cross the mind of the husband,
be responds with ready self-complacency
"I require relaxation, :end must see my
rio nads."
For Husbands.
Yon a, a husband. Your wife is ,
solntely at your mercy. She may not
have known this when she becamie your
wife, bat she has been cotnpell.-d to feel
lit slace that eventful momnent Ho~wever
meglectful, unkind, cruel or penuriously
vppreeslve you may he sure she has had
mo edress. To publish her woes to the

injustice to her. It may he that both

from the public your conduct to her in
private. She has to smile before the
world to conceal the wrongs she has to
endure. and she is compelled to silence
in private lest these wrongs may be in
creased.
She has left everthting to devott her
self to you and yen have never indicated
,our appreciation of her action. She
has planned. toiled and exhausted the
resources of h-ad and hand to minister
to your comfort and advance your in
terests, but not a word of gratitude has
ever escaped your lips. She has been
confined to hearth and home all day
long, to piece out your income, to
beautify and bless your home and to
bring forth, to rear and to mould the
minds of your children, but never an
encouraging word has been spoken in
her ears. She has shown by everything
since she left the tears and tendernebss of
a devoted mother, that you are the one
who. next to her Lord, occupies the
the most sacred place in her heart; but
von have not spoken the endearing word
nor given the gentle touch of affection
since the day she became your wife.
You gave enough of these - aye, too
much- when you wooed in order to wed,
but after the wedding the wooing ceased
and the wife has wept in secret, her
whole nature has been starved and her
whole life, that ought Ito have been in
the perpetual bloom of the month of
May, has become a bleached and blasted
`desert of dry sand. All this has come
to pass for the lack of those trifling at
tentions. those little marks of affection,
those delicate acts of appreciation that
constitute the food and life of a woman's
soul. A true swoman feeds upon the
outward attentions that come from the
i heart of the husband she loves.
Well assorted marriages are essential
to good homes. This is nature's law in
the case To violate it 1' to bring swift
punishment ou the heads of the viola
tors, as well as to bring a curse upon
posterity. The htusband and wife who
are not suited to each other lead cat and

rten. They marry and carry to their
homes the same atmoslphere and rear
other families liket unto the ones in
which they were raised. The wonder
is that there are as many agreeable and
cultured people in the world as there
are.
It is not a favorable omen to see a man
mtuoking a cob pipe while his wife milks
the cow.
