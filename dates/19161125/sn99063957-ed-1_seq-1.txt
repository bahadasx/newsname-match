Rumanians BeKevedv3Have Slipped Out of German Vise
T They Form New Battle line Along Alt River and Prepare
For Desperate Battle Russians and Rumanians Start
Strong Offensive to Head Von Mackensen Off From
Bucharest Venizelos Declares War On Bulgaria . .
: ;
London, Nov. 25. The German drive on Bucharest
has apparently staTted.
The Rumania, official statement, detailing an "at
tempt" to cross the Danube at Simnitza and the Berlin
report that Field Marshal Von Mackensen has actually
crossed that stream, together with knowledge that the
Rumanian line is rfe-formed along the Alt valley, all
hinted to military experts here today that forces were be
ing drawn for 'one of the greatest military struggles of
the Balkan campaign. . -
The fact that none of the Berlin official statements
have made any claims of large captures of men buttresses
the greatest hope here that the . Rumanians in Little
Wallachia where Berlin reports capture of Orsova and
Turnu-Severin have escapd Von Falkenhayn-s encircl
ing movement. It is believed what force is left within
the German vise must be a very small one."
The major portion of this Rumanian army, threatened
by Von Falkenhayn's circuitous dash has, it is believed
here, retired and joined forces in strength along the Alt
liver. Such a line would have the advantage of the
natural defensive positions along the liver. .The line
would, run nearly due north and south and interpose a
.strong barrier to any further encroachments of the Ger
man forces from the west eastward toward Bucharest.
That this, line has been formed, and its strength recog
nized bv the Teutons is indicated, it is believed here, in
the Bulgarian attempt at a flanking movement at
Simnitza. ." '
In'the meantime Field Marshal Von Mackensen, to
whom military critics assign the next step in the Teutonic
move at Bucharest, is expected to start an offensive move
ment in Dobruja. Realization of this plan, it is said, re
sulted in the sudden assumption of a strong offensive
movement by the Russians and Rumanians, reported yes
terday. They haye apparently made a good start Lon
don expects to see violent fighting in this quarter.

FATE OF PROTOCOL
HANGS ON RESULT
OF MEXICAN FIGHT
Agreement Reached by Which
Pershing's Forces Would
Be Withdrawn
IF VILLA IS VICTOR IT
WILL NOT BE RATIFIED
Carranza Must Show Ability
to Guard Border Commis
sion Meets Dec. 8. .
' By Carl D. Groat.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Washington, Nov. 25 Only General
Carranza and General Villa stood today
as possible obstacles to fruition of the
Atlantic City conference agreement for
withdrawal of General Pershing's forces
from Mexico in the next 40 dnys. ,
Tho American government itself is
prepared to. ratify the protocol, inas
much as it was shaped upon terms Presi
dent Wilson himself approved.
What General Carranza will do is a
problem, though the administration be
lieves ho will sign it, even though it
may be distasteful because of inclusion
of provisions thnt the United States
troops may follow bandits into Mexico
at any time. ,
The other obstacle Villas-may be
eliminated by tho Chihuahua City bat
tle, military men way. Hut, they do
not overlook the disastrous situation
that would follow a Villa victory at this
strategic point. Villa is an element in
the situation from - the fact that the
withdrawal is conditional upon condi
tions remaining sntihfactory during the
next 40 days. -i .
A Villa victory now would upset all
withdrawal plans nnd create intolerable
northern Mexican conditions, experts
soy. Carranza will probably acquiesce,
it is thought here, in the light of what
his representatives hove been told. Dur
ing, the past week, the American mem
bers of the commission have been blunt
ly frank in informing the Mexican
group of what consequences they may
expect if they do not meet American
terms. '
Chairman Lane, back in town, was
slated to present the protocol early,
though the president's illness seemed
likolyto preclude a conference today.
The protocol in brief provides for
withdrawal of American troops in 40
days if conditions in northern Mexico
permit, for American pursuit of band
its if occasion arises; for separate pa
trol of the border by each nation, with
cp-operntioii if possible to be arranged
bVfween the representative commauders;
for discussion of internal problems up
on reconvening December 8-
Secretary Lane holds the latter to lie
tho most vital and insists signif icantlv
that reforms, including protection of
American nguts, lives and property
must be accomplished by Mexico eith
er on 1ier owa initiative "or with Ameri
can help otherwise, evidently interefr

Steel Paddles Dead1?.
Pun Francisco, Nov. 25. A lnunch
carrying 50 Bailors to the: naval supply
ship Glacier in Han Francisco bay was
cm in two uy me meet paddles of the
Sacroinento river steamer Apache here
early toduy and at 0:45 one man was
known to have drowned and two in
jured men had been taken to hospitals.
At tuat nour six sailors were missing
from the. Glacier but officers of thnt
hip believed they were all safe ashore.
The- name of the drowned man has
not yet been ascertained. . F..C. Wright,
of Kenton, Wash., a seaman on the Gla
cier, and. William Heilberger, chief en
gineer of the Glacier, were seriously
injured. Heilberger 's homo is Glendale,
Cal. Forty-two sailors were taken from
the water a' few minutes after the
launch sank. -
The accident occurred two hundred
yards south of the Ferry building and in
plain view of passengers on trans-bay
forries.. The lauuch left shortly after 8
o'clock to take Bailors who had been
on shore leave back to the Glacier which
was anchored in "Man o' war row."
The little craft's course took her direct
ly across the path of the big Hacramen
to river steamers and close to the berth
of the Apache.
The Apache was in" her berth, pre
paring to back out aud her paddles were
running to resist the action of the
strong tide. Mo strong was tho tide's
pull, that the little launch was drawn
by it under the Apache where she was
quickly cut in two by tho river boat's
steel paddles. Hho sank immediately
and all those aboard her were thrown
into the water.
Work of Rescue Swift.
Watchmen on the docks sounded an
alarm and the Crowley and Peterson
boat houses rushed launches to the res
cue. The United Htates cruiser Houth
Dakota also responded to tbe alarm
and seat two launches- The imperiled
men were quickly dragged from the wa
tervand Wright was taken to harbor
emergency hospital, while Heilberger
was taken to the Glacier.
The launch of the cruiser Houth Da
kota was declared by officers of the
Glacier to have picked up the body of
one sailor.
The launch was crowded with sailors
when sho set out for the Glacier. (She
moved along safely until she reached
the end of the .Apuche's pier, running
cIobo to tho Apache's steruwheel. Just
as it was passing tbe big river vessel
the tide caught it and swept it irresis
tibly over against the Apache.
The big steel paddle wheel descended
striking the lauuch full and square. A
great hole was torn in her side, letting
the water in with n rush. In less than
a minute uhe broke in two und phing,-"!.

directions.
Splinters of tho lnunch were left
floaiing on tho water and to these some
of tho sailors succeeded in clinging, but
the majority were left to swim until
chilled and dripping they were hauled
aboard rescuing munches nnd cutters.
The Glacier has been used vari
ously as a refrigerator ship and a restau
rant. At present she is used to tarry
supplies. ' .

Denies Deporting '
Employed Belgians
. r
Amsterdam, Nov. 85 German advices
today strongly deny that any but unem
ployed Belgians have been deported
for employment in German factor
ies. It is explained that if by chance some
Belgians who are actually at work have
been included in these transported from
Belgium, it is because Belgian author
ities have failed to furnish German of
ficials with proper lists of those unem
ployed. The German government, it is
asserted, has taken "responsible meas
ures" to return those .Belgians errone
ously deported.
The Cologne Gazette denies that Belgians-deported
from their country are.
oeing used in the manufacture of mu
nitions or in any other war work.
T-
Prices So Much Higher As
fc .To Eliminate Some
Thankfulness.
Now that tho Thnuksgivim;jfilinner
with tho turkey and all the customary
trimmings must be served next Thurs
day, it behooves the good housekeeper
to study up a little ou market prices,
especially since the word has gone out
tlint tue cost of living has stepped into
a class by itself whereby liviiiir may
be termed a luxury.
in order that the economical house
keeper may trim the annual turkey feast
according to tho household pocketbook,
ine rouowing tigures or tbo present day
market arc given, compared to one year
ago- It is a sad, discouraging story.
tor instauce, sugar, now selling at
8 1-2 cents a pouud was worth oulv
0 1-2 one year ago, aud todav it takes
just $2.45 to 'buy a sack of flour while
one yswr ago said sack was priced at
1.05.
I.ard, that household cooking neces
sity nas jumped trora to to M cents a
pound since lust Thanksgiving and the
housekeeper may returJ thaaks if there
are any with the ronsoratioa of it is con
solation that cottolene has advanced
from 18 centra pound to SI within the
past 12 months. '
Bacon, included with other eatables
as part of the staff of life, climbed
tne ladder or living about five cents
a pound and that other good old stand
by, ham, is now four cents higher than
the last day we gave thanks for the
many manifold blessings. . '
Eggs, equal partners in the "ham
and'' family aro retailing 10 cents a
dozen higher than a year ago and but
ter five cents a pound more. Thore 1b
no change iu the price of milk but
there is little consolation in that ns now
the same money that bought a 15 ouuee
ioof of bread, will bring home only 12
ounces. However, sweet potatoes are
on an equal market basis of one year
ago, but here again there is no chanci
to figure out an average as the good
old st aud by, Irish potatoes, have doub
led in price, as one year ago they re
tailed at 50 cents a bushel and now
they are sky-larking along at $1.
I be corn meal story is not sn dis
couraging as now it sells for four
cents a pound, only half a cent more
than one year ago and rolled oats are
only one cent higher, rctnil. Raisins are
15 cents a pound compared to 1- 1-Z
one year ago.
I he man who requires a couple of or
anges for breakfast may have tho satis
faction of eating nt the same price as
one year ago and the dinner oyster soup
will figure bo more than last Thanks
giving- Bananas have not advanced in
price, nor have Hrnzil nuts ana will'
nuts.
There is no cause to give thanks over
the price of turkeys, ducks, geese, or
chickens. Last year tho average turkey
price was 2U cents a pouud while this
year the average figure will, be 30 or
more. Tho cranberry dressing costs two
nud a half cents more a quart. Halmon
thnt sold fur 10 cents is now worth
17 cents a iouiid retail and halibut hns
advanced from 12 1-2 cents to 17.' Geese
were 18 cents dressed one year ago, but
now it will require about 22 cents to
buy the same. Mushrooms have climb
ed the ladder from !I0 cents a pound to
50 cents and Tillumook cheese from 23
cents to SO cents a pound.
All of which seems to indicate that
when it comes to the commissary de
partment of the household, the econom
ical housewife may return thunks for
the fact that the indications aro that
prices will hardly climb any higher and
also from the fact that doctors nil de
clare that we would all enjoy better
health if we would only cut dow n on tho
amount we eat.
