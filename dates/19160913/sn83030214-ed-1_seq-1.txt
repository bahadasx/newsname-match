Ironwood, Mich., Sept. 12.- Arre?t
e.l for the murder of Mrs. Elltabeth
Niehols, widow of or.e of the founders
of Austin, Niehols A Co., ri New York
or, September B, 1915, Arthur Walto?
nen confessed to-night, the police aay, j
that he waa one of the three mas'-.o.l
men who strangled her for her jewels.
For eight mor.ths Waltonen, under
the name of John Lind, has been cm
ploycd in a barber shop here.
One of the patrons to whose neck
Waltonen had been applyine his raz.or ?
notired a acar on the barber'a fore
finger. Waltonen had formerly been
employed by Mra. Niehols, and descrip
tive circulars callinjr for the arrest of
him and others had been widely circu- '
lated. One mark of identifieation was
a acar on the ripht ir.dex finger.
As a result of that observation and
eorrespondenee 44 ith the Naw York po?
lice, which aeemed to clinch the identi?
fieation. two New York detectives came
here and had Waltonen made a
prisoner.
May Free Houaeboy.
His arrest may help to free Onni
Talas. the houseboy who admitted th*
three robbers to Mrs. Nichols's home, at
4 F.ast Seventy-ninth Street. He was
convicted of murder in the first de?
gree. His sentence 4vas -ommuted to
life imprisonment, his friends urging
that his "f.,r.fe.**ion" had been inspirci
by police blackjacks.
The fight to -ave Talas was taken
up by Fmns in a!l parts of the country
and hundreds have aided in the aearcli

murder, convinced that their arrest
woald result in the vindication af
their countryman.
Waltonen was formerly an assistant
butler in the Niehols household. Talas ;
admitted to the police that they had
been on friendly terms, ard that it was
partly through the good offices of
Waltonen that he was able to get the,

Jewels I.ed lo Murder.
It was the jewelry of Mrs. Niehols
and her love of display, that led to
her murder. With her jewel box be-j
fore her she wouM deck herself with
thousands of dollars worth of the
treasures, and pose before the mirror
in her home, careless whether the
servants in the house knew of her
habitfl or not.
Talas r-aid Waltonen knew of this
custom, and that he had tried his best
on aeveral occasions to persuade the
houseboy to admit him and a friend or
two.
Talas was only twenty-two years old.
In time he yielded to the older man, to
whom he felt he owed his position.
Kvcn then, he insisted, Waltonen, the
flrat to enter the house, shoved a re
volver in hifl 1'ace and bnund him. A
maid w-ho came to see why Tala^ B
so long in answering the bell was treat

. ? [By OBMl to Tr* T
Lonrlon, Sept. 12.?The French
struek another swift blow north of
tho Somme to-day. Foch's troops, in
ii vigomu.s assault. battered at tho
German line from Combles to the
river. Within half an hour they had
won the entire first line of German
trenches on a four-mile front, taking
more than 1,600 prisoncrs.
The quickness of the French
thrust took the enemy bv surprise.
Bafora the attack could be rhecked
the poiltta had reached the roail
from Bethune to Peronne, where
they carried by storm a system of
trenches which had been strongiy
fortiried. Marrieres Wood and Hills
14't and 76 were also ovcrwhelmcd
in the forward movement.
By thi." stroke Foch has attained
positions from which Peronne can
be outflankcd from the north. The
French jrrip on the Bethune-Peronnc
road is an immediate threat to Mont
St. Quentin, an important height
which is the key to Peronne.
Combles Almoat Pocketed.

r'rench line to the south. The Brit?
ish conquest of Ginchy?a loss which
Herlin admits to-day--opened the
way for a push north of Combles,
with a view to turning it on that
side. This town. a very important
position on the German second line,
will then be caught in another of
the pockets that have marked the
prop-ress of the Allied offensive on
the Somme.
A wedge ha- been driven between
Hapaume and Peronne. the first objec

the Gernians are forced out of Pe?

With the French Uae far advar.ced bv
the blow to-dav. the next atep in the
process rests with the British. When
Haig resumes his offensive he will
preaa eastward from Ginchy and Guil

from their path. the Allied forees can
move toward control of the whole

he knowfl the theatre better than his own fireside. and
whilr like the Puritans in the honesty of his opinions he
is ronsiderably more humorous in expressing them. Get

mstruction before they can operate

time of year, popgun, cracked-brain

litieal purposes. If the younger mem?
bers of tho board would consulr with
the older members before mtroducina;
measures much time could be saa?ed.'
