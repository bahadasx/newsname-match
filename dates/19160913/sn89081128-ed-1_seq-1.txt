LUME XXXVII.
STEAM TURNED ON
BY OCTOBER FIRST
WORK DELAYED BY STORMS
AND NON-ARRIVAL OF
MATERIAL
TRENCHES ALL DUG AND LAY-
ING OF PIPES IS UNDER
WAY
I Realizing the 'cW proximity of the
iJP
weBfcher
the necessity of tfce
4 completion 'of the heating plant wMch is
being installed by the New Ulm Heating
Company the work of construction is
being pushed as rapidly as possible and
will be ready for use fey October 1st.
The Healy Plumbing and Heating Com
pany of St. Paul is doing the work and a
large crew of men is rushing the plant
to completion.
According to'the contract the work of
laying the mains was to be completed by
September 15th, but owing to a delay in
receiving^the material, the steam will not
be ready for distribution until October
Another delay was caused last
Wednesday when during the heavy rain,
^water rushed down the excavations
'causing several caverns which meant a
loss of several hundred dollars to the con
struction company.
The pipes on Minnesota street were
laid first and that work was completed
Saturday. The mains were put into
the tile that was laid for that purpose
when the paving was put in, several
years ago.
All mains leading from the power plant
to Minnesota street are being laid on
First North street and virtually all the
excavations have been made. The mains
-are being put down and already more
than a block of it is in place with about
six hundred feet more to lay.
A five foot nine inches deep trench
was dug. A four inch concrete base
was laid and then a 7 inch drain base
was placed. Then the steam pipe and
tile are laid which allows for a three and
one-half foot covering.
The mains from the power house to
Minnesota street are ten inch pipes with
a four inch return and on Minnesota
street the steam pipes are six inch with a
two and one-half inch return.
All pipes through which the steam
passes are of steel. The pipes are laid
in what is known as the Ricwil tile.
These tile are split and the lower half is
aiid on the drain base. The steam pipes
ai
a
are then put place and covered with a
mineral wool after which the top half of
the tile is put in place and packed with
an elastic cement which never hardens.
mi
The work at the power plant is also
progressing rapidly. The receiving tanks
have been put place and all of the
machinery is here and is being installed
with as great a rapidity as possible. Be
sides the receiving tanks there are two
vacuum pumps, a 10 by 48 foot oil
separator, a 10 by 48 air receiving tank
and valves and other equipment with
the steam header.
The object of the oil separator is to
separate the oil from the steam before it
goes into the mains. As the steam comes
from the boiler there is a considerable
amount of lubricating oil mixed with it
and this must be removed before going
into the mains. The receiving tank
receives the water as it returns from the
pipes, removes the air therefrom and the
water is used again.
The system is one of the most complete
and economical manufactured and is
one that gives satisfaction wherever in
stalled.
W. A. Rupea of St. Paul has charge of
the work here and has employed in the
neighborhood of twenty men. Mr. Rupea
and the firm by whom he is employed
are very reliable and there is no doubt
but that the work will be a credit to all
concerned.
The same firm that is installing the
heating plant received the contract for
laying eleven blocks of sewer and water
mains along Front street. Work was
begun Friday and will be pushed as
rapidly as possible to completion.
It is required to dig to a depth of
twenty feet several places while an
average depth of seventeen feet will be
reached. The sum of $13,000 is involved
in the contract.

NOTABLE MOVIES BOOKED
Ruby Theatre Has Several Big Sen-
sations In Film World For New
Ulm Patrons.
Knowing that the show going public
of New Ulm is derservirig ofr good things,
Manager C. J. Woodman&fee of the Ruby
Theatre has made arrangements to run
some of the best pictures that have ever
been brought to this city and among the
pictures that will be shown at the popular
South Minnesota street show house
within the next two months are:
"DJana, The Huntress," September 14.
V/The
Unwritten Law", 7 reels, Septem-
iter 21.
"The Battle Cry of Peace," 9
October 7 and 8.
"The End of the World," 6
October 19.
"God's Country and the Woman," 8
reels, October 26 and 27.
"The Yellow Menace," the greatest
serial ever produced, starts October 2nd
and is complete in 16 episodes.
"The Ne'er Do Weel," by Rex Beach,
10 reels.
reels,
reels,
After reading over the list of famous
pictures one can but see that Mr. Wood
mansee is bringing to New Ulm real
treats in the line of moving pictures.
In "Diana, The Huntress" one sees
not only a charming picture but a
classic work of art as well. This pro
duction is the beginning of a new era
in the fine art of motion pictures—the
renaissance of the world's greatest
masterpieces in literature and art.
The "Unwritten Law" is anotheroneof
the leading pictures of the age and is one
that attains to a high moral level. The
work of Beatriz Michelena on the witness
stand in the production is the most real
and convincing emotion ever shown in a
picture play. It is a picture that has no
flaws and is in a class by itself.
'The Battle Cry of Peace" is one of
the wonder pictures of the age. It has
been shown in all the play houses of the
larger cities and is said by many to excel
the "Birth of a Nation." This will
undoubtedly be the best production of
the season.
In the serial, "The Yellow Menace",
is shown a masterful, sinister and
.secretive plot for the destruction*,of the
Umted States by the yellow race. This
is another one of the startling picture
plays and is being shown in this section
of the country for the first time.
Fortunate indeed are the citizens of
New Ulm to have Mr. Woodmansee
make it possible for them to see such
motion pictures as he has booked
for the next two months and it is with
great pleasure that the Review can make
the announcement to the public that the
plays will be here.
MUSICALE AT TURNER HALL.
A musical treat is in store for the
members of the New Ulm Turnverein,
Turner Ladies' Society and members of
the Turner Club to-night (Wednesday)
when Miss Rosemund Wrage of Arling
ton, Wash., will give a musicale at
Turner Hall, assisted by local talent.
Miss Wrage is an accomplished violinist
and delighted a New Ulm audience with
her playing when she was here on a
visit some years ago. She is a grand
daughter of John Spenner, one of the
very prominent figures in the early
pioneer days of New Ulm and who met
a tragic death December 25, 1866. Miss
Wrage recently graduated from a musical
conservatory in Chicago and will shortly
start on her first concert tour thru the
United States. She arrived in New
Ulm Friday evening and will be a guest
at the Fred Seiter home during her so
journ in the city. The musicale to
night is in the nature of a treat given
the invited guests by the Turnverein
and Ladies Society and it is hoped that
a large number will accept of their
hospitahty and give the talented violinist
a warm welcome.

NO MORE LICKING
REVENUE STAMPS
tONGRESS REPEALS REVENUE
TAX ON LEGAL PAPERS AND
DRUGS.
NEW ULM FIRMS HAVE SPENT
MUCH MONEY FOR "WAR
TAX" STAMPS.
Local agents of the various railroads
have been notified that the use of
revenue stamps on all bills of lading or
on baggage shipments has been dis
continued and the order went into effect
at once.
This act has been in force since De
cember 1,1914 and was to have extended
to December 31 of the present year.
The general revenue bill repealed the
emergency revenue bill stamp taxes
and the internal revenue bureau has
ruled that revenue stamps are not re
quired now.
The repealing of this act does not
only do away with stamps on bills of
lading and on baggage shipments but
also removes the necessity of sticking
stamps on telegraph and telephone
messages, parlor car seats and berth
tickets, bonds, debentures, certificates
of indebtedness, certificates of stock
transfers, bills of sale, promissory notes,
express and freight manifests, bonding
instruments, conveyances, insurance
policies, entry of goods, passage tickets,
power of attorney, protests, perfumery,
cosmectics and chewing gum.
With the repeal of the stamp tax on
the above named articles and documents
it seems that with the proper trans
lation of the act that the special tax on
the capital and surplus and undivided
profits of banks, brokers who have
not paid as bankers, commission brokers,
commission merchants, pawnbrokers,
theaters, circusses, bowling alleys and
pool halls, dealers in tobacco, cigars and
snuff and manufacturers of cigars,
tobacco and, cigarettes has not been re
pealed and will stand as designated By
the law.
The number of stamps used in New
Ulm alone would be surprising infor
mation if it were possible to learn it
definitely but the Review is not able to
give in round numbers the amounts
expended for'stamps since the existence
of the law. The Eagle Roller Mills have
used on an average of $1,000 worth in a
year. The Hauenstein Brewing Com
pany has expended $75 for stamps used
on bills of lading alone while Schells
Brewing Company has used $110 worth
of the little stickers. Other manufactur
ing concerns of the city have used many
thousands of dollars worth of the stamps.
It was attempted to ascertain from the
banks of the city what amount of money
had been paid out for stamps and while
no definite amount was learned, it is a
fact that in two of the banks, alone,
$1,648 worth of stamps were passed out
to the public. The various law firms of
New Ulm also sold stamps and con
sequently it is impossible to learn the
exact amount of revenue that was pro
duced here.
The first seven months during the
existence of the law the tremendous sum
of more than $23,000,000, of which the
citizens of this locality paid their share,
was realized from the sale of these
revenue stamps.
One of the drawbacks of the repeal
of the old revenue law and the advent
of the new law is that the income tax has
been increased 100 per cent and this will
mean a much greater item of expense to
the larger manufacturing plants than the
stamp tax did.
The Male Chorus of the Lutheran
church will Journey to Fairfax in the
choir members' automobiles, next Sun
day to render a few selections at the
dedication of the new Lutheran church.

ROUTINE BUSINESS OCCUPIES
ATTENSION AT MONTHLY
MEETING.
At the regular meeting of the city
council which took place on Tuesday of
last week, Mayor Fritsche having the
unanimous sanction of the councilmen,
decided that for the coming year there
would be no licenses granted to carnival
companies. This is a commendable
action as amusement concerns of that
nature do a city no good and have a
tendency to take considerable sums of
money from the commonwealth from
which no benefit has been derived.
The culvert leading the water from the
flats at Sixteenth South street was
bad condition as the result of recent
Jieavy rains and was in need of atten
tion. The matter was referred to the
committee on streets and the street com
missioner ordered to have necessary re
pairs made.
City Attorney Albert Pfaender is
on the border with the guardsmen and
the matter of appointing some one to
serve during his absence was discussed,
but no action was taken.
An estimate on the cost of culvert
construction at TT
1 1
South street
by Alb. Liebl, in the su'jfi of $125, was
allowed as was one of $400, estimate
No. 5 for work on the new cemetery house
and one of $140.50 for repairing the
sidewalk on College Hill, which was
washed out during a recent storm.
The bonds of the city engineer in the
sum of $1,000 and of Hippert & Werner,
plumbers, in the sum of $2,000 were
approved and placed on file.
A transfer liquor license from Gruber
& Schreyer to Gruber & Albrecht was

Robt. Albrecht 1takes~bver* his interests.
Some trouble is being experienced
with the water pipes which lead into the
Review office building and the matter
was turned over to the street, water
and light committees and the city en
gineer and superintendent of the electric
light and water plant.
During the past month there were
3,033 and one half hours of hand labor
and 491 and one half hours of team
labor put on the streets of the city.
Chief John Herzog entered complaint
that under the present status of affairs
many times there isno justice of the peace
in the city. The matter will be in

COUNCIL WAS IN ERROR
Says City Council Exceeded Their
Legal Rights When Setting
Aside Ordinance.
In regard to the matter of granting
a free license to the Hagenbeck and
Wallace circus, Councilman Krook has
made the following statement to a Review
representative:
"The city ordinance provides a mini
mum charge of $25 as a license fee for
circuses per day, or as much more as the
mayor may decide upon. This ordinance
can not be amended or the license waived
simply by the resolution of the council
as was done about two months ago for
the benefit of the Hagenbeck & Wallace
shows. It was feared that this company
would not come to this city unless
granted a free license. But even tho
the city council had not the right to
waive the license the majority of the
members voted in favor of the same
After the meeting Mayor Fritsche,recog
nizing the fact that the council had no
legal right to waive the license, wrote
the circus company that the license fee
would be $25 and that the water and
light would not exceed twenty-five
dollars and that the company could have
the use of the fair grounds any time after
the county fair had been held.
"Mr. Phinny, the twenty-four hour
man, appeared and preferred to hold the
circus in the North German Park, claim
ing that there would be plenty of room
and it would save them an extra mile of
hauling. I stated to Mr. Phinny that
even though the council had passed a
resolution waiving the license the action
was not legal and that the minimum fee
fo $25 would have to be paid. Mr.
Phinny then called upon Mayor Fritsche
and I explained the situation whereupon
Mayor Fritsche stated that the circus
would be allowed to exhibit in the North
German Park and the license fee would
be $25. All this appeared to be satis
factory to Mr. Phinny and it can not be
understood why the business men of this
city should be so free to make up a purse
for the license when there are so many
other local necessities to which their
contributions can be made."
Apparently there ,has been, another
-tfemiffestrin^S teapot raisetHby somebody.
If the city ordinances mean anything
at all, they should certainly be handled
with due legal respect. If it is possible
to disregard them in one instanpe, it is
quite possible that they may be disre
garded in others and by others than
members of the council.
BENEFIT PICNIC NEXT SUNDAY.
It was indeed well that the benefit
picnic which was to have been given on
Herman Heights Sunday was postponed
until next Sunday, September 17, be
cause of the fact that the weather was
far from favorable.
This picnic is to be given as a benefit
to the families of the soldier boys, of
New Ulm, who are now in the service of
the government in Texas.
With the various attractions of last
week, it was thought advisable by the
various committees in charge to postpone
the event until next Sunday and should
the weather prove unfavorable the affair
will be held at the Armory.
It is hoped that everyone will do his
or her mite to make the picnic a success.
STREET SIGNS PLACED.
In order that the work of keeping
motorists on the proper side of the street
may be made less difficult for the city
police force twelve "Keep to the Right"
pedestal signs have been placed on
Minnesota, Broadway and State Streets
by the city officials.
These signs have been placed at the
following stations: On Minnesota street
at First and Second South streets
Center street and First, Second and
Third North streets on Broadway at
Center street and First and Third North
streets and on State street at Third,
Fifth and Sixth North streets.
Policemen will insist more than ever
now that the laws relating to traffic be
complied with. If not SQ, complied
with, offenders will be asked to appear
before the city judge and hear what he
has to say in regard to the matter.
If the present method proves effective,
other signs will be placed on various
corners where traffic is heavy.
E. J. Franklin, state faetory inspector
was in this city last week finishing up
his work at the local manufacturing
plants. He had nothing but words of
praise for the factory owners of New Ulm
for the sanitary condition in which they
keep their places of business and also
the protection that they give to their
employes.

ARMY REGULATIONS
STRICTLY ENFORCED
MEN IN UNIFORM GET ORDERS.
NOT TO WRITE TO HOME.
PAPERS.
GOVERNMENT PROVIDES FUNDS
FOR DEPENDENT FAMILIES
OF MEN.
There is an army regulation which
prohibits men in uniform from writing
news letters to their home papers and
this regulation is now evidently being
more strictly enforced than was the case
when the Minnesota troops first went to
the border. Thomas Pfaender, son of
Wm. Pfaender of this city, joined the
militia shortly before they left for Fort
Snelling and up to a week ago had
written regularly for the Review, telling
of camp life. His letters were uniformly
cheerful and made the best of things that
were not too pleasant but last week he
received orders to discontinue sending
reports to be printed and for that reason
there is no news direct from the front
for our readers this week.
In place of the letter hereafter readers
will have to content themselves with,
reports as given in daily papers and with
such news as comes by way of private
correspondence. The Review will be
very glad, indeed, to print any letters
or portions thereof which friends of the
boys receive here so that a more general
knowledge of conditions as the boys live
through them may be had by the citizens,
in general.
It looks as tho those who have the
management of things down in Texas
might be anxious to keep under cover
some of the facts as they are presented
to the enlisted men but the order may be.
simply a matter of carrying out army
regulations strictly and the result of
somewhat exaggerated stories sent out
by the correspondents of the big city
papers who were obliged to make the
,t^vXK^flphatever subject presented itself
in the monotony of camp life on the
border.
Governor Burnquist has been officially
notified by the war department of the
$2,000,000 appropriation by congress for
the aid of persons dependent upon the
men serving on the Mexican border.
The department plans on making pay
ments direct to such persons. So far
such work has been carried on in Minne
sota entirely from voluntary contri
butions.
With the passage of the bill allowing
for the appropriation the war department
has revoked the order permitting the
discharge of guardsmen who had persons,
depending upon them.
"When are the boys coming home
from the front?" is a question that can
be heard almost every day on the streets
of New Ulm. Many reports contra
dictory with one another, have been
received the past two or three weeks,
and 'even as yet no one but the men at
the head of affairs can give a definite
answer and thus far they have refrained
from doing so.
Recently contracts for half a million
dollars worth of provisions, hay and
grain in addition to the regular contracts
which are weekly being filled, were let
by Chief quartermaster, Colonel H. L.
Rogers.
Other things that would indicate that
the boys will not be home so very soon
are the completion of a $15,000 hospital,
the erection of large warehouses along
the tracks, the purchase of $260,000
worth of horses and mules, contracts
made for feed and fodder for about 2,000
horses and mules and the purchase of
food and supplies for months ahead.
With those things and others equally as
bright it does not indicate that the
soldiers will eat Thanksgiving dinner
with the home folks this year. In spite
of all there is still a ray of hope that the
boys will be able to return to then
homes by January 1. This is a little
information that has been given out by
an officer who is in close touch with,
affairs.
A monthly pay roll for a regiment o£
infantry is approximately $30,000 andV
with eight regiments of infantry at
Llano Grande this amounts to $240,000
a month. With two battalions of' ar
tillery, the hospital and other auxiliaries
bring the monthly pay rollupto $300,000,
It costs $2,700 to feed the men for one
day and besides that there is the cost of
supplies, food, forage and other materials.
There are more than 100,000 militia
men on the border. ,?*
Regardless of what the boys may "t
think, from all indications the govern- J^
ment did not take them down there for ki
demonstration purposes but are actually
