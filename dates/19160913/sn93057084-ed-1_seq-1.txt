WET ORGANIZATION
IN THIS STATE ACTIVE
liquor interests Sending Out "S.
0. S." Gall to Trade-Should
Be Warning to Dry Forces.
Mitchell. S. D.—One of the chief
dangers of the present wet and dry
campaign from the standpoint of the
'dry forces is the tendency to apathy
land over-confidence, according to the
statement of the state Anti-Saloon
League officials here. There are a
half dozen or more state organizers at
work in an effort to organize each
county and voting precinct in the
state. These men report, it is said,
that many of the leading temperance
workers of the state fail or refuse to
manifest any interest in these or
ganizations, on the ground that the
state is sure to vote dry in November
and that it is unnecessary to expend
so much time and effort in organizing.
It is pointed out at the dry head
quarters here that such an attitude on
the part of the friends of prohibition
would be suicidal to the prohibition
cause in the fall. They say that the
liquor interests are working hard and
spending a load of money in organiz
ing the wet vote of the state. In sup
port of this claim they are showing
a letter sent out by the president of
the South Dakota Retail Liquor Deal
ers' association urging the trade to
get busy in the fight against the drys.
The letter, omitting the name of the
person to whom it was addressed, fol
lows:
"SOUTH DAKOTA RETAIL LIQUOR
-^-.DEALERS' ASSOCIATION.
Office of the Secretary.
S. D.
"Dear Sir—The superintendent of
the South Dakota Anti-Saloon League
boasts of the fact that he will raise
$75,000 to make South Dakota a pro
hibition state.
"The election takes place next No
vember.
"The drys are organizing indus
triously and they are leaving nothing
undone to carry out their designs.
"It is high time that the retail liq
uor dealers of South Dakota prepare
their defense against the proposed at
tack of the prohibitionists.
"Complete organization of the liq
uor trade is absolutely necessary.
This fact Is admitted by every wide
awake license holder in the state.
"We want the active and financial
co-operation of all South Dakota sa
loonkeepers, for unless the trade is
completely organized and the organiza
tlon properly supported, our enemies,
may succeed in putting something
5 over on us.
"With the assistance of the voters
of South Dakota we have defeated
our intolerant enemies on three dif
ferent occasions. We can do it again
if you will do your part, but remem
ber, "danger is always present when
men are too confident.'
"The officers of the state organiza
tion ask every man engaged in the
retail liquor business to become a
member of the association more
over, they have financial assistance.
"At a recent meeting of the execu
tive committee it was decided, begin
ning Jan. 1st, 1916, to assess each
member of this association $10 per
month. We sincerely hope you will
see the necessity of carrying out this
plan and trust that we will have your
absolute co-operation. Checks for
the amount of the monthly assess
ment should be sent to JOHN DRADY,
TREAS., SIOUX FALLS, 8. D.
"Yours very truly.
(Signed) "J. A. FARL,
"President.
"P. S. Please do not consign thi3
letter to the scrap heap. This is im
portant business.
"If you have anything to suggest
that might benefit the trade in a gen
eral way, such suggestions from you
mill be highly appreciated."

"The editor has fully made up his
mind that if he ever falls heir to a
railroad ticket lonir enough he is
going to South Dakota. If the

they are, blamed if wc would not

soldiers to have kick. Ollieer.s
who hava spent thirl years in the

part of a soldier as it is a part of
the make-up of a Missouri mule,
