linois state primary the candidates
waited for the count of ballots which

While there has been a spirited con
test over virtually every state nomina
tion, the struggle for the Republican
gubernatorial nomination overshadow
ed the others. This was a three-corn
ered battle between Frank O. Lowden,
backed by the regular Republican or
ganization in Cook county and the

championed . by the faction led by
former Governor Charles S. Dlneen
and Frank L. Smith, who worked In-
dependent of any slate or factional
backing.

out of the ordinary. He has donned a
miner's togs at Butte and gone 3,000
feet down Into the earth, climbed
mountains more than 12,000 feet high,
attended state and county fairs and a
national exposition, and spoken from
almost every sort of platform, Includ
ing the rostrum of the great Mormon
temple in Salt Lake City. He has
made 141 speeches and has been
photographed thousands of times, once
at dinner and several times with chil
dren in his arms.
Mr. Hughes reached New York in
good health and spirits. He will rest
four days at Bridgehampton and then
will start on a trip that will last, with
only one break of two days, until elec
tion day.
