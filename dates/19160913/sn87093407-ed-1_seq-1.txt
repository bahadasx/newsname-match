With 111 king county precincts complete. Poin
dexter was leading Humphrey bv -4 5 3 votes for first
choice and by 1214 votes on a combination of first
and second choice votes, at 1 p. m. Wednesday.
First returns gave Humphrey a slight lead in first
chojce votes over Poindexter, but the count at the
auditor's office at lp. m. t when the first 111 precinct*
had been tabulated, put Poindexter ahead.
MAY WIN BY 10,000
It can be staled conservatively now that Poin
dexter will have an even break with Humphrey in Se
attle and king county. Indications are that they will
run about even thruout the western part of the state,
so unless all present returns are badly upset. Poindexter
should win over Humphrey with a majority equal to
whatever the eastern part of the state gives him.
Spokane county alone will likely give Polndeiter 5.000 vote*, and
thla will be tweJled In Walla Walla county. A Poindexter majority o(
from 7.000 to 10.000 votea aeeroa probable now.

first and second choice, with second, with 3.555. Hallalne third,
with 3,fi63, and Whitney, the organization candidate, a bad fourth, with
2.K96 votes
One of the surest indications of the complete returns thus far
counted is the defeat of Hamilton for sheriff by John Stringer.
