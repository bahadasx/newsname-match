who have signed are consistent with
those agreements and endeavoring to

FORGER; COVER
FACTS OF CASE
Police Mysteriously Silent
As To Arrest of Arthur
Sperry.
C. C. TYLER'S NAME
ON WORTHLESS CHECK
But He and Others Interest
ed Shield Youth Whom
Court Deliberates.
Charged with forgery, Arthur Sperry
of 483 Helen street, was discharged
by the police this morning and his
case was nolled in the city court.
Police officials say they know nothing
of the case, but It was current gossip
about the city this morning that
Sperry had been arrested because the
name of C. C. Tyler, of 768 Fairfield
avenue, a vice president of the Rem-
ipgton Arms-Union Metallic Cartridge
Co., had been signed' to a check.
, A counter ichecky of the American
Bank & Trust Co. 'was used, so the
story goes, and made out for $60.
Sperry was arrested by Detectives
Frederick Feeley and John P. Curry.
Though the' police officials would make
no comment on the case, it was ru
mored about police headquarters to
day that the charge of forgery against
Sperry was because he was suspected
of forging Tyler's name.
Sperry, it was suspected, mad6 out
the check for $60 and signe Tyler's
name7 Then he is said to have gone
to a grocery store or butcher market
in Pembroke street where he had an
account totalling $15 Tnd to have
tendered the false check in payment.
The merchant accepted the check and
gave $45 in change. When it was
found that the check was bogus, corn
plaint was made to the police and
Sperry was arrested.
In court today the charge was
dropped. Rumor had it that Mr.. Ty
ler had no desire to beconnected pub
licly with the case. Superintendent
of Police Redgate denied knowledge
of the facts of the case.
When asked, about the particulars
and acquainted with the stoVy, Mr.
Tyler said that he would make no
statement and .would neither affirm or
deny the truth of the details., i
' Moses Manwaring, . president, o'f . the
American Bank & Trust Co.; referred
inquirers to A. J. S. Silliman, assist
atn treasurer of the bank, and the
latter said that the matter was one
in which Mr. Tyler, was interested
personally and the bank had nothing
to do with the prosecution.
..According to report, Sperry or
someone acting for him, has repaid
the merchant 340 of the $60 and
agrees to make good the , rest.

All the barrel straighteners employ

was made that Markle's family would
starve if he were sent to Jail. The
court then sentenced Markle to Jail
for six months . but suspended sen

Athens, Sept. 12, via London, Sept.
13. (Delayed.) King Constantino has
accepted the resignation of Premier
Zaimis and his cabinet '
The belief is entertained in the en
tente quarters that the retirement of
the Zaimis ministry is preliminary to
the entrance of Greece in the -war
with the allies. Recent ' despatches
from Berlin and Vienna show that
there also it is regarded as probable
that Greece will soon abandon neu
trality and Join with the enemy's cen
tral powers.
The precise causes which led to the
resignation of the f ministry have not
been disclosed, on account- of the ex
ceptionally rigid censorship which is
being maintained. A London despatch
of yesterday says that Zaimis had
complainej that internal incidents
were preventing him from dealing
with the external situation. It is be
lieved' in London that his resignation
was. due to the fact that he accepted
the premiership on the understanding
that he was to maintain neutrality

Co., to - get immediate housing fa

This determination became known
today following a long conference of
the executive board of the Housing
Co. held in the Chamber of Commerce
rooms.
The element of chance in loaning
large sums, of money to those who
owned only land, is said to have been
discussed at length. Manufactur
ers who will 'be large investors in the

cate delays attendant upon the form
ulation of housing schemes that have
not been well tried and assured of
profitable revenue.
George E. Crawford, president of
the Chamber of Commerce and an ac
tive member in the new company,
said today that every effort would be
made to complete building at once,
though it is not likely the first house
would be ready'1, for occupancy until
January 1.
Though uncommunicative on the
details of the plans now projected,
whichu-e merely tentative, Mr. Craw
ford asserted that the "ultimate out
come of the present move for, quick
construction would place orders in
the hands of those construction com
panies who could offer the best guar
antees to build the largest number
of houses upon specification in the
.least possible time.
Under this plan, no specific location
would be necessary; provided the
plots were suitable and probably
would spread the operations over
various sections of the city, rather
than in one section.
It is known that scores of realty op
erators have offered land to the com
pany and numerous builders are be
ginning to arrive in this city to pro
sure, if possible, a share of the
work. ,
.Under the present scheme the com
pany, irrespective of fad or fancy,
will contract for work where it will
receive the lowest figure by reason
of the enormous contracts it can let
with the capital behind it.
