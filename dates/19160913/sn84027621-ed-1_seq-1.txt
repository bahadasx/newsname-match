TESTIMONY WILL BE TAKEN
It May be Weeks Before Result in the
. Knott-Catts Contest is
Arrived at
Tallahassee, Sept. 13. The taking
of testimony begins Friday in the
governorship contest. The court an
nounced that in the voters being put
on the stand an interesting question
arises as to whether or not the sec
recy of ballot is to be violated.
Counsel for Wl V. Knott filed a re
joinder to the allegations of the state
canvassing board concerning ballot
box frauds in Hamilton and Madison
counties, in the gubernatorial re
counts, and the supreme court will at
once begin the taking of testimony to
decide whether the vote of these coun
ties should be thrown out. If the con
tention of the state canvassing board
is sustained, Sidney J. Catts will re
tain the certificate of nomination, and
his narrie will "appear on the ballot as
the democratic nominee for governor.
By reason of the inspectors at the
polling places having signed affidavits
alleging frauds,' they will not be re
garded as competent witnesses to im
peach the testimony they have al
ready sworn to. The voters them
selves will, therefore have to be sum
moned b ythe state canvassing board
to support its allegation of fraud
This may consume many weeks.

We do not care to be entered in the
knocker's column of your paper, but
we have some things to say and must
say them to get the feeling out of our
system. About the school books. It
is a shame for the country schools,
the majority of which only have a six
months term, to be compelled to lose
a month of this valuable time waiting
for the Ocala schools to open before
the school books are ordered. I want
some of the country. correspondents to
speak out and "knock" the "powers
that me" for this ridiculous habit of
putting this business off. The books
will keep for the Ocala schools a
month right in Ocala and could be
ordered in time for our schools. If
you go to Mr. Brinsoh he puts the
blame on some one else and it is pass
ed, on and shame to say it, forgotten
and neglected. We boost our county
and want newcomers. We have some
new comers right here in Shady who
can't get books for their children and
we had to be honest with them and
tell them it would be a month yet be
fore we could get any. We need an
assistant. "The teacher asked for one
and the supervisor and some of the
patrons went to Mr. Brinson and told
him the situation. The teacher could
not do herself or the children justice
without an assistant. He calmly put
us off for a fortnight to see if we
could possibly peg along with one
teacher. Why, O, why do our city
cousins give us so grudgingly and lit
tle help ? We love our city friends and
want their children to have every op
portunity, but are we not equally as
worthy? Ye country cousins, speak
out and let your thoughts on these
subjects be known.

News has just been received in
Belleview of the decease of Mr. Philip
Hafner at Smethport, Penn. He was
a brother of Mr. Adam Hafner.
The Masons met in their hall last
Thursday night with quite a strong
attendance of out of town members.
Mr. John Freeman Hames, who has

There was one of those little "tem
pest in the teapot" cases around in
the town hall one day last week that
ended happily for all concerned. It
seems that one very well known citi

very well known citizen a real hard
slap in the face. Maybe he handed
him two or three of them. About that
I am not certain. He also handed out
a line of talk that was real shocking,
in fact, it was language that no good
church member would use on the
Sabbath. He also laid violent hands
on the second mentioned citizen's
shirt, but this is no place to tell what
became of the shirt. According to the
testimony they must have had an
awful time of it, and the second or
aggrieved citizen saw blood on the
moon, and to satisfy his desire for
revenge he hunted up the minions of
the law and swore out a variety of
warrants covering the different
phases of the case, to-wit: assault and
battery with intent to hit. Some peace
