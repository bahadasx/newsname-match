further pilfering will not be let pass
by.

THE COUNTY BOARD
OF EDUCATION
A Larger Administrative Unit
Rural Education and School
Management.
The sparse settlement during the
early stages of development of sev­
eral of the counties lying in the
north-eastern portion of the state
has created a serious problem as to
the education of the many small,
widely isolated groups of children.
Small enrollments naturally result in
much higher per capita costs. This
and the fact that in some instan­
ces the taxable area is insufficient to
support the numerous small schools
necessary, has both rendered the
contiguous better situated school
districts unwilling to incorporate
such territory and has for the like
reason precluded the formation of
the new territory into a district of
itself.
As an attempt to solve the pro­
blem, the Legislature some years ago
passed a bill creating the county
board of education, to have charge
of all territory in the county not in­
cluded in any organized district. The
board consists of three members, the
chairman of the county bftard of
commissioners, the county treasurer
and the county superintendent of
schools. The law makes it the duty
of the board to provide school faci­
lities for every child of school age
in the territory under its jurisdic­
tion. Provision is made also for the
dissolution of any organized district
desiring to ttansfer control to the
county board of education.
The county of St. Louis affords an
excellent example of the operation
of the law and of public apprecia­
tion of efficient organization and
management. The territory ad
ministered by the board of educa­
tion of that county has, owing to
the dissolution of organized dis­
tricts, increased greatly in area.
Aiid this -inerease- has, in turn, en­
abled the providing of bettersuper
abled the providing of better super
efficient and economical administra­
tion than was attainable in the small
district units.
That the larger administrative unit
results in the foregoing advantages
is to be expected when the follow­
ing facts are considered: The total
enrollments of all the schools makes
possible the employment of special
supervisors of industrial and other
subjects the providing of district
nurses and medical inspection and,
through the purchase of supplies in
large quantities, results in the secur­
ing of much lower first costs, better
control over quality, and lower
freight charges.
Other advantages follow in the
matter of the selection of teachers,
in the location, style, and erection of
new school buildings, and in many
other directions. And all these ad­
vantages are obtained at a less cost
per pupil than it seems possible to
obtain them under the ordinary
school district organization. It is
the recognition of these facts that
has led to the steady increase of the
unorganized district through the dis­
solution of previously organized dis­
tricts. The dissolution of districts
is entirely voluntary and no influence
whatever, other than the very evi­
dent advantages of the system, is
used to extend the jurisdiction of
the county board of education.

COOK COUNTY SHARES
FIRST HONORS ON POTATOES
According to reports received here
Cook county and Beltrami county
were tie on points for highest score
on potatoes displayed at the State
Fair. Lack of more varieties pre­
vented Cook county from getting a
higher score, as Beltrami county had
several not shown in Cook county's
exhibit.

continued day and night so there
will be no break in the pouring of

SOCIAL INSURANCE FOR
INJURED WORKMEN
By Richard Jones
Social insurance for injured work­
men, sickness, old age and unemploy­
ment will come because economic
development challenges society to
look more closely into the well-being
of its members. And the more close­
ly society inquires into the necessity
for such measures, the more ap­
parent it will be that the adminis­
tration of social insurance fund is a
function that the state must per­
form.
We look after the mentally incom­
petent. Why should we not also
provide for the physically disabled?
If it is the duty of the state to pro­
vide for one, why not both cases?
Germany, England, Switzerland
and other European countries have
made rapid strides along these lines.
Switzerland has a system of com­
pulsory fire insurance, covering im­
provements and even household fur­
niture. A specific tax is levied and
collected as all other property taxes
are collected. This tax goes into a
specific fund and losses are paid out
of this fund by the state.
In Minnesota we are interested in
the question of state insurance to
cover cases of industrial accidents.
The present workmen's compensa­
tion law is admittedly defective. It
has not eliminated waste. To a
large extent it has done away with
the personal injury attorney, but
what formerly went to the ambu­
lance chaser now goes to the private
insurance company, and in expenses
incident to the private insurance
business.
It may be urged that the insur­
ance companies are not making much
money in Minnesota, but the fact re­
mains, that the injured worker, the
man chiefly concerned, receives no
more compensation on the average
under the present system than under
the liability law which was in oper­
ation prior to 1913.
There is a big leak somewhere.
There is waste that would not ob­
tain if the state were in the busi­
ness.
We propose to do away with the
private insurance agency. The state
should collect a specific tax from the
employers of Minnesota, according
to the hazard in each industry, and
from this fund pay the claims of
the men who are injured and the de­
pendents of those who are killed in
the development of the industries of
the state.
Experience with such a law —and
this scheme is in operation in some
of the states—will show that the
injured men will receive a higher
compensation at a lower cost to the
employer than under the present
irake-shift system.
Five Dollars in Gold
Given Away
For the purpose of encouraging
the advisability of saving when
young, we have decided to give
FIVE DOLLARS IN GOLD to
any boy or girl under the age of
sixteen years, who deposits with
this bank in its Savings Depart­
ment the greatest amount of
cash actually earned, from the
1st day of September 1916, up to
and including the fifteenth day
of the same Vnonth.
