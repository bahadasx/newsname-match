"FOOTBALLPROSPECT
IS G00Dn-SCHULTE
Tiger Mentor Says Men
Must Train Fast For
Washington Game.
13 M MEN TO RETURN
Veterans Are Already on Rol
lins Field Getting in
Condition.
"Football prospects at Missouri look
better than for years, but we can't
say anything very definite about the
team until the men show up for prac
tice next Monday."
These words sum up the impres
sion of H. F. Schulte, who is to coach
the Tigers this fall. Mr. Schulte ar
rived in town last night and when
seen by a Missourian reporter this
morning it was difficult to get him
to talk about anything but Simpson's
wonderful performance at Newark
last Saturday.
He did give out a few things for
football followers to think about, how
ever. Here they are:
"It all depends on the condition of
the men when they report next week.
If they are in good shapes we 3hould
be able to turn out a good team this
fall, but if all the veterans are soft
and flabby, we may have difficulty in
getting them into condition for the
first games.
"And with the annual contest with
Washington only four weeks away,
we may have to do some fast training
in order to present a hardened team.
And don't forget that the bunch from
the St. Louis school are expecting to
clean up again this year. They have
Io3t Lewis, of course, but there arc
plenty of men to take his place. It
all means, though, that the Tigers
must be at top speed within a month."
Neither Schulte nor Brewer is say
ing much about football this year, but
both arc sitting back with that air
which says: "Wait and see." And
Tiger fans hae every reason to put
their confidence in these men, for,
with only three or four veterans last
year, they developed a bunch of
sophomores and green men that gave
Kansas a stiff battle.
This year, with thirteen of the sev
enteen M men back and with a prom
ising bunch of subs and scrubs left
from la3t season, chances seem good
for an eleven that will make a good
showing with the other Missouri Val
ley teams. Captain Lansing will be
back in the game, after staying on
the sidelines all of last season with
injuries. He will bolster up the cen
ter of the line.
Stankowski, Pittam, Rider, White
and Rutledge of last year's back
field men will be back while Grove3,
Preston, Van Dyne, McAnaw, Hamil
ton and Muir will be veteran line
men. Giltner will be the only one
of the ends to return.
Haines, one of the best punters on
the squad last season, is a good pros
pect for the team. Sevearl of last
year's freshmen may break in the
line-up this season, but their chances
will be determined later.
Several of the veterans who have
been in Columbia all summer have al
ready appeared on Rollins Field and
are kicking the pigskin around Just to
limber up a little before the regular
practice starts next Monday. Others
will join them the latter part of the
week and perhaps Schulte himself will
stroll out there just to look them over
and tell the flabby ones to do some
running and. other hard work to get
into condition.
"BOB" MAT HURDLE IN EUROPE
A. A. U. InTites M. U. Hnrdler to Take
Foreign Trip.
"Bob Simpson will hurdle in Europe
this fall if his University work can
be arranged," said Director Brewer
this morning, "it is a great opportuni
ty and a great honor to have him
named as one of the four men to take
the trip, and, if he can go without
losing out in his studies, he should
make the trip."
