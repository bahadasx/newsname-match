rSKOOKE, Sept. 12. until tno
right of Tommy Atkins to en
rollment and allotment has been set
tled by tho secretary of tho Interior,
the case of the United States against
Minnie Atkins et at. will not bo tried
In the federal court If tho motion
of District Attorney D. Uuyden I.ine
baugh, filed today, la granted.
The petition sets forth that tho
suit was ordered by tho secretary of
tho Interior In December, 1914,
through error on tho part of agent
or employe of tho Interior depart
ment. Tho motion for postponement
of tho trial Is based on the conten.
tlon that old papers showing that
patonts about to be Issued to Tommlo
Atkins by the Dawes commissioner
In 190"i were held up pending 'it
Investigation of Tommy Atkins' right
to enrollment and allotment, have
boon found. The land Involved In
tho case Is producing vast quantities
of oil and l worth now almost
(2 000.000.
Issuance Waj Halted.
That the suit should never have
been ordered filed Is tho contention
of tho government In the motion
filed by I.lnebaugh. It sets forth
that the Issuance of tho patonts to
tho Tommy Atkins land has boon
held up since 1905 and nothing has
occurred to change Its status.
Tho Issuance of patents was orig
inally halted by the report that the
only Tommy Atkins who ever existed
was the father of Minnie Atkins and
that ho died In 1878.
It la admitted that Minnie's father
was named Tommy Atkins and that
he died In 1878, but they declare
that Minnie had a son who waa liv
ing In 1 899 and who was entitled to
enrollment and allotment.
Hut Where Is Tommy?
In view of the. discovery of the
Information set forth In the petition,
I.lnebaugh asserts that only the sec
retary of the Interior has Jurisdic
tion of the case, and that the allot
ment must be cancelled or declared
valid by him before the courts can
act In the matter at all.
Records that date back Into the
nineteenth century are offered as ex
hibits In the case.
The property In litigation Is now
being operated by Charles Page of
Tulsa, who Is under heavy bond to
tho government. Page hus stated re
peatedly that he could produce the
real Tommy Atkins. at any time, but
Tonjmy has not yet showed up.

in the way of the 'Icrmnns for the

French position north of IVronno
seemingly a menacing one.

There are whole townships In this
