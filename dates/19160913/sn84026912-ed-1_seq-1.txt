up his hand's and they spared him.
Five hundred miners from the Ylog

Progressives Join Hands and Defeat)
l>eniocratic Governor.
Portland,-Maine, Sept. ll.-Maine
Republicans, reinforced by returning
Progressives, won a signal victory at
the elections to-day, They elected a
Governor, an Auditor, two United
States'Senators and four Representa
tives in Congress, and wresting con
trol of the State 'House of Represen
tatives from the Democrats, will be
able on a joint vote of tho Legisla
ture to elect tho other State oillcers
not chosen by popular vote.
Carl li. Milliken led bis ticket, de
feating Governor O. C. Curtis, who
sought, re-election, by a plurality of
approximately l ?1,000.
The Republican drift extended to
county officers, the greater number
of counties choosing Republican
county attorneys and sheriffs. Those
ollices are important locally because
their holders are charged with en
forcing the prohibition law.
The vote was heavy. The Republi
can loaders say nearly all tho 18,220
Progressives of I wo years ago voled
the Republican ticket.
Hot Campaign.
The election was the culmination
ol* one of tho hottest fights ever
waged in Hie State, and marked the
reunion of the 'Republican and Pro
gressive parties, whose differences in
1912 gave the electoral vote of
Maine to President Wilson and two
years later resulted in Hie election of
Governor O. C. Curtis, a Democrat,
by a plurality of 3,189. To-night's
figures Indicate that the larger per
centage of tho Progressive vote which
two years ago was 18,226 was cast
to-day for tho 'Republican ticket.
McCormick o pt i m 1st ic.
Now York, Sept. ll,-Chairman
.McCormick, of the Democratic Na
tional Committee, issued the follow
ing statement:
"The result of the election in
Maine indicates a swooping Demo
cratic victory in November. I have
never claimed that we would win in
Maine, because I realized that to car
ry such a rock-ribbed Republican
stronghold in a Presidential year
would be practically impossible.
"Wo havo materially reduced the
usually large Republican majority al
ways obtained on national issues in
that State, and tlpat insures the elec
tion of President Wilson in Novem
ber by an impressive majority, just
as a Republican plurality of 12,500
in September, 1892, prefaced the
election of President Cleveland in
November.
"It is the first time United Stales
Senators have ever been elected In
Maine by popular vote and the senti
ment as to national issues is to bo
gauged by the vote cast upon the
same issues in other years."
And So Is Wilcox.
Chairman Wilcox telephoned from
Syracuse to Republican headquarters
to-night a statement, In which he
said the result of the Maine election
meant a reunited Republican party,
assuring tl?o election of Charles 13.
Hughes in November.

5,000 TON BRIDGE SPAN PKLL.
Probably SSS Uvea Lost-Work a
Modern Wonder.
Montreal, Canada, Sept. ll.-The
central span of the Quebec bridge,
which bas been under construction
many years and which war to link
the Canadian Continental Railways
from Halifax to Vancouver, fell to
day as it was being placed In posi
tion. 'Many workmen were killed. I
but tho number as yet is unavnila- |
hie. I
The span, weighing 5.000 tons, I
was towed lo the bridge site this
morning, and its placing bad been
heralded as one of the greatest feats
of tho world. Commission experts
from the United States, Croat Bri
tain ami Germany worked out tho
plans.
This is tho second catastrophe for
the bridge in which lives have been
lost. In 15107 a section collapsed
following an accident.
The Canadian govern mont called
in world experts to complete the
structure.
The bridge was to be used by eight
railways and would shorten the
transcontinental trip 200 miles.
Ninetty Men on Bridge.
lt is estimated that 90 men were
on the bridge at the time the span
collapsed. Arrangements aro being
mudo to send divers down into the
St. Law renee to determino if it is
possible to raise the steel span and
whether traffic will he "blocked. The
death Hst has been placed at prob
ably 25.
Card of Thanks.
To the Voters of Oconee County:
I desire to express my sincero
thanks to the voters of Oconee coun
ty for the support given me in the
recent first primary election for She
riff. While I was defeated, I have
no ill-will toward any man, for I ap
preciate the right of every citizen to
cast his ballot for whom he pleases.
Naturally I would have preferred to
have been fortunato enough to have
been given tho office for which 1
sought, or to have been placed In the
second race. But all could not win,
and I came out of tho race as I went
into it, and through it, with malice
toward none and good will for all
those who sought tho office and
those whose citizen rights called
upon them to cast thoir ballots.
I thank one and all, whether or
not numbered among those who sup
ported mo, for the many courtesies
extended during tho campaign, and
for the many evidences throughout
of confidence in and respect for mo
and tho manner in which I m'a de the
cam])?iga. Very truly,
J. C. SHOCKLEY.
