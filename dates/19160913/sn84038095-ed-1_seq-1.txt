FAIR PROVES
SUCCESSFUL
Attendance Not Quite Up to Last
Year Owing to the Poor Con
dition of the Roads.
CANDIDATES DRAW GOOD CROWDS
Floral Hall Attractive and Well Pat
ronized—Racing Lacked Interest
—Association Makes Money
ARJON, Sept, 12—(SPECIAL TO
THE RKVIEW)—The annual Craw
ford County Pair iheld at the fair
grounds here on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, -and Friday of last week
was most successful and the manage
ment of the Fair Association is to be
congratulated upon the excellant en
tertainment given. The attendence was
hardly up to that of a year ago, due
to the fact that the roads were muddy
the last two days, which kept many
from a distance from driving in their
cars to attend. The fact that W. L.
Harding, republican candidate for
governor and E. T. Meredith, the dem
ocratic candidate both visited the fair
attracted a goodly number of people,
who were anxious to hear these men
speak. Harding created a most favor
able impression upon the county fair
crowd and everyone seemed to like
the big, whole hearted man.
Tuesday, the entry day at the fair,
was a busy day. Live stock barns, and
stalls were filled with line horses and
cattle, both beef and dairy breeds,
sheep and swine.
One pen of hogs had a row of pre
mium ribbons along the top taken at
different places.
Floral hall was more attractive than
•with sheaves of grain, and bunting by
ever. It was artistically decorated
Mrs. Emil' Schwartz and Ernest Lud
wig. Mrs. Schwasz has raised so many
flowers which are displayed every year
and helped So much that recognition
will be given her. One cornstalk. 14
feet high, stood by the west door. The
shelves of fruit were well filled with
plates of handsome apples plums,
pears, and grapes of many different
kinds. Wheat, oats, barley aiul corn
made a fine dipslay. The shelves and
cases reserved for the culinary de
partment were crowed. Our exhibitor
showed 50 kinds of canned fruit. Jel
lies jams, pickles and catsup were as
excellent as can be made, while the
judges had a difficult task in judging
the bread, pies, cakes, rolls, anil
doughnuts, which were an exhibition
tffdelicious cooking. This has not been
i). very good year for gardens but some
flue vegetables were shown. From
Denison, the Boy's store showed a
very attractive exhibit of fall styles
and the Denison college, which is do­
ing much for the young people of the
county, gave an interesting exhibit.
The judges took one half day to look
over tWe e.xh.ibit of school work. It is
gratifying 'indeed (to the people of
Crawford county to sfee the improve
ment in these .exhibits from year to
year and to know tliat our county com
pares very favorably with any other
in the state under the very favorable
supervision of /superintendent O'iry.
The training of the children in useful
work showed its good results in the
wood work, and corn raised by the
boys and the .needlework of the girls.
The books and maps shown are a cred
it to the schools. The department of
needlework was crowded all the time
with people looking at thte exquisite
work shown.
The racing was not "p to expec
tation, owing to the number of fair?
being held the same week, making it
hard to get the horses here.
Wednesday was a pleasant day and
a very large number was in atten
dance. Mr. Harding spoke in the after
noon upon the subject of roads from
the stand point of the farmer, who
knows the value of roads better than
anyone else, but who also knows that
the best way of getting them, and
their paying for them is a problem
to be considered seriously.
An afternoon of band music, acro
bats, trained dogs, and races follow
ed. Mr. Gaines' Peter Boy took 1st in
the free-for-all pace or trot Dex, 2nd.
Thursday, Mr. Meredith spoke in the
afternoon. He pleased the temperance
people by his outspoken statements.
While plainly in favor of good roads,
he advised cutting down the hills and
putting in pe^manen^ bri/lgtes, and
left the surfacing of the roads about
where Mr. Hardinj leaves prohibi
tion to the will of the people. The day
was cloudy, which prevented many
from coming, and the track heavy
from the rain, but the free attractions
gave a good program.
Friday was an ideal day and the
pretty fair ground had a good crowd.
All enjoyed the afternoon's program
of sports and racing. Peter Boy took
first money in the pace.

Charles Mc.Bad took 1st money

An interesting relay race was won
by Charles McBab, who made up a
long gap.
The motorcycle race was won by
Clarence Chamberlain.
Lloyd Sherman, 17 year old boy re
siding at Yetter, was brought to Den
ison this morning on the early train
on the Illinois Central and taken to
the Denison hospital for ti^atment.
The ^oung man was shot while raid
ing a watermelon patch near the town
of Yetter, it is .said. Word from the
hospital this afternoon is to the of
feet that the bullet has been probed
and that the patient is getting along
as well as can be expected. The bul
let was fired from a revolver.

SECOND WEEK OF
Last Week DevoKed to Trial of One
Case, That Being the Case of
Meyer vs Meyer.
COURT TERM IS TOO SHORT
Large Am°unt of Business Will of Ne
cessity Have to Be Carried Over
Until the Next Term.
District court is in session this week
and engaged in the trial of the jury
work. Last week was aevoted to equi
ty business and most of the time was
given to the trial of one case, that ol'
Meyer vs Meyer, a case in probate.
Tlie chief question at issue was whe
ther in the railroad wreck that oc
cured at Gothenberg, Nebr., three or
four years ago, in which Mr. and Mrs.
August Meyer were both killed, the
wife survived the husband. It is an in
teresting question, .^nd we do not
know what the evidence disclosed.
The case of Balentine vs Kremin, an
action in which a guardian was
sought for the plaintiff's mother, was
tried to a jury and a verdict returned
under order of the court for the de
fendant. This case has been before
the court for a long time and evidence
was taken during the summer months,
but no decision was rendered until
the verdict of the jury on yesterday.
The case of the First National Bank
of Marshalltown, Iowa, vs Herman
Grill was on trial Tuesday before a
jury. This was a case in which the
bank at Marshalltown brings suit
against Herman Grill for a claim vfliich
arose some time ago, growing out ol'
the purchase of material from some
wholesale house who assigned its
claim to the bank at Marshalltown.
After the defendant knew of the as
signment he made a payment of $200
.or more to the wholesale house. The
court ruled that he'could not claim the
credit as against the bank.
There are a large number of jury
cases on the calendar that will prob
ably not be reached at this term. The
case of Hennings vs Erne will be tried
next week. It is a case which prob
ably will require several days to try.
On the criminal docket indictments
were returned against Ward. Jochims
and some other defendants in jail.
The case of the State of Iowa vs
Jochims will probably be tried at this
time, but an application for contin
uance will be filed in the case against
Ward as the defendant is not ready
for trial at this time.
Necessarily a. large amount of^civil
business will be carried over until nextf
term. The terms of court in Crawford
county are entirely too short to dis
pose of the business that accumulates
liere, but there does not seem to be

any chance for relief in view of the
fact that other counties have business
requiring the attention of the'court.
For the short lime that court is in
session if some way could be adopted
to induce attorneys to try cases to the
court the probabilities are that not so
much time would be consumed. [In:

tically all of the business is tried to a
jury unless by agreement the jury is
waived.

were admitted to citizenship during
the present term of court, they being

ANOTHER CARNIVAL
Ed A. Evans Shows, Under Auspices
of Denison Firemen, During the
Week of September 2£ith.
Denison is to have another carnival
commencing Monday, September 25th
and continuing diritij Saturday evening.
September 30th. The Ed A. Evans Car
nival company has been secured by
the consolidated Are department to
come to Denison for the purpose of
raiding funds with which to purchase
a fire truck. The firemen already have
considerable money in tho treasury
and hope to increase this material^
with the carnival, when they propose
to go before the city council with a
proposition to purchase an up to date
nymt. Mr. H. A. Biedy. advance man
was in the city yesterday and inform
ed the Review that the carnival this
year is bigger and better than ever
before. The carnival travels with a
special train of sixteen cars and noth
ing but good clean moral shows are
permitted. Anew attraction this year
is the silo drome, which is causing a
sensation in every city where the com
pany shows. It is similar to the mo
tordrome, only the sides are perpen
dicular, making it more perilous for
the motorcycle .riders.
The attractions this year will be on
the main streets in the business sec
tion of the city, the firemen having
visited the business houses and se
cured their consent to have the tents
pitched on the main streets.
One of the features of the show is a
sixteen piece brass-band, which will
give concerts each afternoon and eve
ning during the week. The band is
said to be one of the best traveling on
the road this season.

professional women who seek to at
tract attention.
The House of Menagh, the Omaha
branch of the Denison store, conducted
a style show at, t\ie Brapdeis theater
at that place on Wednesday and Thurs
day of last week, two shows being giv
en each day. The big theater was
packed at every entertainment and
the newspapers spoke very highly of it.
Ora Cne, fashion expert, was procur
ed by the House of Menagh to lecture
on the garments and he pointed out
afternoon dresses, evening gowns and
the newest wrinkles in suits, chapeaux,
opera coats. "Understand 'what you
wear and then stick to those lines and
colors only," advised Mr. Cne to the
women of Omaha. "Some food is
poison to certain persons. So_ it is
with colors. If any color is unfiecom
ing to you leave it alone.
a woman who weighs 200 younds, don't |over the
try to dress like the woman who
weighs only 95 pounds."
The women of this locality will have
an opportunity to learn what is cor
rect in fall styles for some of the fin
est garments, both from the Omaha
and Denison stores will be' worn by
the models. These gowns are taken
right out of stock and are not import
ed for show purposes. Tickets for the
style show can be reserved this week
by applying at the Menagh store. And
just a hint—if you really care to see
the show be sure and make your ap
plication early for every seat will be
gone by the middle of next week. No
charge is made for tickets.
BICYCLE POLO
Latest Fad Among Youngsters Fortu
nate Enough to Own Bikes—Not
Classed As Parlor Game.
Bicycle polo is the latest fad among
the youngsters of Denison, and it prom
ises to even surpass football as a fav
orite sport. Of course the new game
is confined to those who own bicycles,
but from all indications new players
will be available in short order for
fond parents are receiving demands for
bicycles from their young sons which
are hard to resist.
The new game is being played on
the pavement on East Broadway and
is attracting considerable interest
even among the grown ups. Bamboo
poles are fitted up with mallets and
the players mount bicycles and drive
a large rubber ball up and down the
street much in the same fashion as
the expert aiito polo players did at the
athletic field a few weeks ago. It
proves most "exciting and riders *ind
bicycles are badly bruised, but there
are always new players to be drawn
from to keep the teams up to the' re
quired numbers. It is by no means a
parlor game and we predict tiiat it
will be short lived for parents will
soon forbid their children playing It

MANILLA, Sept. 13—(Special to

If you are was cast in deep gloom last Sunday
death of Mr. William R.
Grimes, one of the pioneer settlers of
Crawford county, and a highly re
spected citizen of Manilla. Mr. Grimes
had been in failing health since last
February 'and it is said that he was
suffering, from Bright's disease. He
gradually became weaker until Sun
day, when he passed peacefully away.
The deceased was born in Batavia,
Kane county. 111., in 1849, and at the
time of his death was 6.8 years and 11
months of age. He was reared and
educated in Batavia, and in the year
1864 enlisted in Co. i, 42d 111. Infantry
for one year and served in the army
of the Potomac, and took part in the
battles of Nashville and Franklin,
Tenn. He was then sent to Browns
ville, Texas, on the Rio Grande river,
where he assisted in guarding the
frontier. He was honorably dis
charged at Port Lavac, Texas, in De
cember, 1805, after which he re-en
tered school in Batavia. After com
blacksmithing and worked at %his
-plating hi^ education he learned
trade in that city until 1881, when he
moved to Denison. Shortly after his
arrival in Denison Mr. Grimes pur
chased 320 acres of land in Nishnabot
ny township. Later he purchased ad

he tilled with credit to himself.
He was married at Batavia, 111., on
Sept. 6. 1877, to Miss Mary Messner,
who still survives him. Three chil
dren were born to Mr. and Mrs.
Grimes Bennie, who died at the age
of six years, and Ray and Carl, who
