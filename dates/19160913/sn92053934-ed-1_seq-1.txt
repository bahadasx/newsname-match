President Shonts Refuses Proposal of
Mayor Mitehel Hearing on
Car Strike.
, ;,Jyjejf- --York, Sept 23. Inter
est? In the strike today centered
fn the meeting of the public service
commission at vhichtraction officials
and leaders of the strikers will make
their formal replies to the recommen
dation of the commission for an imme
diate suspension of the strike and set
tlement of the questions at issue by
arbitration. Both sides have announced
unofficially their intention to reject the
recommendation.
But few surface cars were operated
today and passengers were forced to
use the subways and elevated roads.
Congestion at express stations was
extreme.
Although transportation within the
city is far from paralyzed, thousands
are compelled to resort to the use of
automobiles, moving vans, trucks and
other vehicles.
There was little or no violence dur
ing the night, largely due to the fact
that policemen were stationed on roof
tops where attacks had been made on
elevated trains.
Hugh Frayne, state organizer of the
American Federation of Labor, an
nounced today that between 12,000 and
20.000 men will take part in a parade
and demonstration tomorrow.
Mayor Mitehel. it developed today,
has under consideration two methods
of settling the strike. One is to re
quest Governor Whitman to call a spe
cial session of the legislature to pass
a la.w compelling both sides to accept
arbitration, while the other proposes
the immediate granting of a franchise
to the New York Bus company, incor
porated, to run machines through cer
tain streets.
The Interborougli Rapid Transit
and the New York Railways company
formally rejected today the public
service commission's recommenda
tion for a strike settlement made yes
terday. The two companies, controlling th
subway, elevated and "green car"
surface lines, declined to hold further
conferences with the representatives
of the union and announced that it is
their intention to continue to operate
their lines on the present basis.
Brooklyn detectives, it was dis
closed today, are investigating a re
ported plot to damage property of the
Interborougli with an explosive. A
cylindrical package four inches by
three inches in dimension was found
by a track walker near the Borough
hall subway station in Brooklyn late
last night. It contained dynamite of
the powerful kind generally used in
undersea operations.

SCAR ON FINGER
SOLVES MURDER
While the Barber Kept on ShaTlnir
Amateur Detective Studied Vivid
Tell-Tale Mark.
-frtmwood. Mich. Sept. 13. It wasrlo
the detective instinct of a Finn, mid
cast in life's program a a teamster,
that the alleged murderer of Mrs. Eliza
beth Nichols, widow of a New York
millionaire, owed his arrest here yes
terday. The murder occurred in New
York a year ago.
Eight months ago Arthur Waltonen,
a Finn giving the name of John Lind,
dropped off a train at Ironwood. He
went, to work as a barber in the shop
of Walter Hoint.
A few weeks ago another Finn, the
teamster with the detective instinct,
also dropped into Ironwood and went
to the shop where Waltonen was em
ployed, for a shave. He noticed a livid
scar on the index finger of Waltonen's
right hand as the later was shaving
him. It was a long and peculiar scar
and the visitor's mind harked back to
a public description of one of the men
suspec ted of Mrs. Nichols death, Fin
nish papers all over the country had
described the scar as being on the out
side of the finger, curving across the
top and ending on the back of his hand.
The teamster went to Dr. A. II. An
derson, the only man in this city with
whom he was acquainted. He com
municated his suspicion. Dr. Ander
son diif not believe it. Several days
after the teamster left Ironwood the
doctor tiad Waltonen shave him and
studied the scar. Then he took Harry
Bay, a lawyer, in his confidence. Bay,
too, was shaved. The doctor and the
lawyer became convinced that the nus
picions of the teamster were well
founded. Some time elapsed while
they made rertain of obtaining a $250
reward offered for Waltonen's arrest.
Detectives from New York arrested him
yesterday and he ii said to have con
fessed. Onevl Talus was sentenced to die for
the murder, but sentence was com
muted to a life term at Sing Sing
prison.
Waltonen's alleged confession com
plicated three others. The motive was
robbery. The robbers obtained $28,000
in cash and Jewelry, but overlooked
$150,000 in Jewelry.

GREAT FIGHT
OVER BALLOT
RULES STATE
Chicago Is Battle Ground in
Struggle of Aspirants
for Governorship.
DUNNE PARTY CHOICE
Large Vote at Primaries To
day Predicted for All
Sections of Illinois.
Chicago, Sept. 13. Their ram
palgns for nomination completed,
republican and democratic candi
dates at the Illinois state primary
today waited for the count of bal
lots which will mean success or
defeat for them.
While there has been a spirited con
test over virtually every state office
nomination, the struggle for the re
publican gubernatorial nomination to
a large degree overshadowed the oth
ers. This was a three-cornered bat
tle between Frank O. Lowden of Ore
gon, 111., backed by the regular repub
lican organization in Cook county and
the state; State Senator Morton D.
Hull of Chicago, championed by th
faction led by former Governor
Charles S. Deneen, and Frank L. Smith
of Dwight, who worked independently.
Predictions of victory were issued
at the headquarters of each of the
three candidates while the votes were
being cast.
The expense of the primary cam
paign, estimated to exceed by many
thousand dollars all previous primar
ies, is further evidenced by the num
ber of workers on duty in the 6,369
voting precincts in the state.
- - Goremor Dunne "Conlldent.
Governor Dunne, opposed for the
democratic nomination for chief ex
ecutively William II. Hrinton, Dixon,
asserted that he had no fear of defeat
through the llth-hour endorsement of
his rival by tho Sullivan faction and
the regular Cook county democratic
organization.
One man on the state ticket, Patrick
J. Lucey, attorney general of Illinois,
was unmindful of hopes and fears, as
he was unopposed for renomination
on the democratic ticket. Various
congressional and legislative candi
dates on both the democratic and re
publican tickets were in the same sit
uation. Charles E. Fuller, republican
congressman from the Twelfth dis
trict, and John McKenzie, republican
congressman from the Thirteenth dis
trict, have no republican opposition
and no democratic opponent for the
November election, a position which
they share with Martin B. Bailey, re
publican state senator from the Tweu-ty-second
senatorial district.
The polls opened at 7 a. m. and will
close at 5 p. m. Both democratic and
republican leaders predicted a large
vote.
Governor's Family at Polls.
Governor Edward F. Dunne, his wife
and son Maurice voted today in a poll
ing place near the Dunne residence.
It was the son's first vote. He be
came of age last March. Neither the
governor nor his wife was aware of
their son's presence until after they
had voted.
"Well. look who's here!" exclaimed
the governor, shaking his son's hand.
Mrs. Dunne kissed him.
It. required nine minutes for Gov
ernor Dunne to vote; Mrs. Dunne cast
her ballot in three.
"It's the limit when a man can't
have his wife cast a ballot for him,"
the governor remarked, smiling. "She
can vote for city and county candi
dates, however, and she's going to
vote for whom she can."
The governor inquired how he was
running before leaving the polling
place.
Tolce Quell Disputes.
Police were called to quell disputes
at the polls in several wards. One ar
rest was made in the 18th ward when
a man who gave the name of Charles
Murray was reported to havt attempt
ed to vote under another name. He
fled from the polling place when the
alleged attempted fraud was discov
ered and was pursued by a policeman
who fired a shot at him.
Fist fights between workers for rival
democratic factions were reported at
several precincts in this ward. Wil
liam Heller was stabbed during one of
these altercations. Clyde L. Day a for-
. mer assistant corporation counsel, and
t rank L. Held quarreled at a Cth ward
polling place and were arrested, but
later released. A heavy vote was cast
in nearly every republican ward in the
tcity during the early hours, while the
vote in most democratic strongholds
was lighter than expected.
Election officials estimated that not
more than 325,000 votes, would be cast.
In the Thirteenth District.
Galena, III., Sept. 13. Politicians in
the Thirteenth congressional district
made no prediction early today, be
cause of the unusually large vote
which was being polled. The weather
