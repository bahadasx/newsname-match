The great battle of the Somme Is approaching a decisive stage. By their
frosts yesterday npd today the French troops under Gcnernl Foch have
lrtdy begun what may be termed a flanking operation against Pcronne, after
cutting tho German lines of communication between Pcronne and Combles.
Advancing along a fo-mllc line, the French have captured the entire third
line of German defenses between Combles and Pcronno and have established
themselves directly north of tho latter place. Combles is now under the com-

BEItLIN, Sept. IS. The combined "grand
offensive" of the -Allies will be met by a
combined "grand defensive" of the Central
Powers, who will swing to the attack when
the proper time comes.
The great war council being held at the
Kaiser's headquarters on the eastern front
Is for tho purpose of unifying the direction
of all military movements by armies of the
Central Powers. Since early In tho war
they have acted completely In accord In
their military movements, making It possi
ble to .beat off vastly superior energy forces.
That scheme of unified offense and defense
will be made even more effective as the
result of the present conference, attended
by war chiefs of the four empires warring
on tho Allies.
Most favorable reports were brought to
the war council from tna different fronts.
The Austro-Oerman commanders sent word
that the latest Russian offensive around
Italics has been stopped. It was learned
that the German and Bulgarian Invasion
of Rumania continues to make progress,

broken, but the X-ray picture showed that
he had only a strained tendon.
The Cardinals Jumped, on Kppa nixcy for
two runs In t'l-s opening Inning and might
have scored mare. If It had not been for a
questionable decision at third base.
tThe Cardinals objected no strenuously to
this decision that Bescher, who was put out
of yesterday's game, nnd Long bpth were
banished by Umpire Byron. As a player
put out of the flrft game Is not allowed
to come back for tho oecond, the Cardinals
were in a badly crippled condition. It was
necessary for Hugglns to use two lndelders
tn the outfield, as Smith, another Cardinal
put out of yesterday's game, was Indefinite
ly suspended by President Tener.
ned Ames, the veteran of Ilugglns'a staff,
was picked to oppose Itlxey.

that Councilman Cahlll came to. his plaoe
of business, 404 South street, and asked him4
to say that Woods lived there if any one
came to Investigate.
"Schwartz further says that there were
other visits made to him by Cahlll upon
which occasions Cahlll asked SchwartS
again to say that Woods lived there, and if
any ono camo to see him about It he could
even go so far as to take them up to a
room and say It was Woods's room.
"Schwartz further says in his affidavit
that Councilman Harrington came to his
place of business and told him he need not
be afraid of saying that Woods resided
there, and that they would take caro of
