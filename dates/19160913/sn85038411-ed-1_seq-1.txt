PLEA TO SETTLE
N. Y. STRIKE IS
* FLATLY REJECTED
Interborough Rapid Transit
tnd Railways Co. Decline to
Confer With Unions
DYNAMITE IN SUBWAY
High Powered Explosive in
Station; Few Cars Run; Ex
treme Congestion
iCew York, Sept. 13. The Inter
borough Rapid Transit and the New
York Railways Company formally re
jected to-day the Public Service Com
mission's recommendation for a strike
settlement made yesterday. The two
companies, controlling the subway,
elevated and green car surface lines,
declined to hold further conferences
with representatives of the union and
announced that it is their intention to
continue to operate their lines on the
present basis.
The rejection, presented by Richard
R. Rogers, general counsel to the two
companies, read:
"The Interborough Rapid Transit
Company respectfully represents 'to
the commission that it cannot arbitrate
its rights to enter Into agreements
with 10,306 of its employes out of a
total of 11,800 when the employes
who have signed are content with
those agreements and are endeavoring
to carry them out in good faith."
The agreements referred to are the
"master and servant" contracts which
bind the men not to ask for wage in
creases or betterment In working con
ditions ior two years. The distribu
tion of the contracts among the
Interborough and green car employes
forced the strike, union leaders claim.
Find Dynamite
Brooklyn detectives, it was disclosed
to-day. are investigating a reported
plot to damage property of the Inter
borough with an explosive. A pack
age four Inches by three inches in
dimension was found by a track
walker near the borough hall subway
station in Brooklyn late last night. It
contained, accrding to the Bureau of
Combustibles, dynamite of the power
ful kind generally used in undersea
operations. Officials regarded the ex
plosive as so dangerous that they
threw It into the East river.
But few surface cars were operated
to-day and passengers were forced to
use the subways and elevated roads.
Although traction officials claim
more trains than normal are in
operation, congestion at express sta-

Resignation of Zaimis Cabinet
Believed Preliminary

Instead of resting on the ground
won in yesterday's great attack north
of the Somme the French continued
their thrust last night, capturing the
village of Bouchavesnes, and a wood
ed area nearby.
Bouchavesnes lies east of the Bap
aume-Peronne road, cut In yesterday's
drive and Its capture with adjacent
territory apparently clinches French
possession of thlf main highway to
Peronne.

American Commissioners
Securing Military Advice
on Patrol For Border
New London, Conn., Sept. 13.—With :
the arrival here to-day of Major-Gen- i
eral Bliss, from Washington, American 1
members of the joint international
commission proposed to take up again '
the question of devising an adequate
system of policing for the Mexican
boundary. It was laid aside tempo
rarily by tho commission In order that
the American members might secure ■
military advice on certain points.
The conferences have taken up,
while awaiting General Bliss, outlines |
of economic and physical conditions in
Mexico. In presenting the latter re
view yesterday Luis Cabrera, head of
the Mexican commission, drew atten- :
tion to the progress that the Carranza
government had made. In January,
1915, he said, the Carranza forces con- !
trolled only a fringe of states along
1 the gulf coast and a few ports on the
west. The remainder of the country
was in the hands of Villa and Zapata
| and their followers. Since General
; Carranza to-day faces only scattered
: outlaw bands and there Is nothing ap
proaching organized military oppo
sition to his rule throughout the coun
| try, his representatives apparently feel
justified in predicting that complete
i order soon will be established.

GEnMAX SPY IX TOWxr
Colonel Hemming Say* One Tried to
Learn fiovernment Secrets in
His Laboratory
I Colohel Henry C. Demming, chemist,
of 15-17 North Third street, this morn
i insr stated that he was approached by
] a German spy who sought employment
|ln his laboratory as chemist. This is
I the Colonel's story:
"A man, who said he was a Bavarian
chemist in nGea or work, sought em
ployment at my laboratory, saying that
l he had only fifteen cents in the world.
As everybody knows I have about com
i pleted a system of eliminating the
j poisonous gases from submarines for
: the United States Government. His ac
tions seemed suspicious to me and after
; an investigation, which showed he was
well supplied with money. I let hitu
| out."
The supposed spy only got a look into
the laboratory, the Colonel said.
How a Mechanical Error
Gave Credit to the A. P.
Tn the handling of a newspaper from
day to day there are .many internal
troubles, especially In the editorial and
mechanical departments. In this lite
we are all prone to err and in a news
paper plant the proneness is multiplied
by the multiplicy of opportunities. Only
a dav or two ago there was inadvert
ently printed upon the first page of the
Telegraph under the credit line "By the
Associated Press." a partisan political
story which did not come from the
great news association at all. It did
come, however, just like much other
matter, from an entirely different
source, and in the making up of the
page the linotype credit lines "By the
Associated Press" and "Special to the
Telegraph," were mixed in the rush of
the mechanical department. Thus It
was that a purely partisan story was
credited, through error, to the Asso
ciated Press, which is absolutely non
partisan. instead of a special contribu
tion to the news of the day. The story
had to do with the alleged controver
sies in the Democratic national com-*
mittee.
Quebec Span Fall Due to
Failure of Lifting Girder
Quebec, Sept. 13.—Loss of life in the
collapse of the center span of the Que
bec bridge into the St.Lawrence river is
now placed at twelve. The St. Law
rence Company. Limited, announced
that examination indicated the span
was lost through the failure of the
lifting girder on which too great a
weight had been put.
Preparations now arc under way to
replace the center span as soon as
practicable.
BRIDGE CO. ACCEPTS RI.AME
Ottawa, Ont., Sent. 13. The St.
Lawrence Bridge Company has noti
fied the Canadian government that it
accepts full responsibility for the fall
of the Quebec bridge span and gave
notice that it would undertake to re
place the span and complete the
bridge as soon as possible. With steel
scarce it is believed it will take two
years to construct a new span.
PUSH WORK ON NARROWS
McManus and Co , the Arm which has

ville, are pushing the preliminary work.
Already shacks for the construction
force have been erected and It is ex
pected the work will be pushed to com
pletion as raDldly as possible. The
canal bed will be partially filled so an
to provide a highway along the old tow

Trainer Pounded to Death by
Elephant Before Thousands
Klngsport, Tenn., Sept. 13. Wal
ter Eldridge, 23 years old. was pound
ed to death against the ground by an
elephant of which he was assistant
trainer, before thousands of persons
here late yesterday.
Apparently without cause the ele
phant, which Eldridge was leading to
water following a circus performance,
became infuriated and seizing the vic
tim in his trunk began pounding him
furiously against the ground and end-1
ing his life by stamping him. The
I crowd of spectators became excited
and a general stampede ensued, sev
eral women fainting. Shots fired into
the animal's body only Increased his
fury.
The animal was gotten under con
trol only after his regular trainer ar
j rived.
Neighbors Thought Swaying
Scarecrow Was Suicide
Fon du Lac. Wis., Sept. 13.—Neigh- 1
• bors of Albert Engel commented on
the realistic scarecrow he had erected
iin his cornfield. They wanted to find
I out what he had used to rig up the
dummy and congratulate him on his
skill. But when they called at tho
house Engel was not at home. His
, family said he had not been there for
j a couple of days.
I The next morning Peter Raul, while
I passing the Engel place, stopped to in
! spect the supposed scarecrow and
found it was the body of the farmer
j himself. He must have been hanging
! in the tree at least a day and a night
and a score of neighbors on foot and
automobile parties had passed without
! realizing the "scarecrow" had been a
j human body.
Engel had hanged himself without
I taking his hat off, and the wide brim
, concealed his features.

American Eagle Easily
Disposes of Champion Cock
Peking, Sept. 13.—After trimming
the feathers and otherwise disguising
their mascot eagle, the United States
marines attached to the American
legation here recently succeeded In
matching their bird of freedom to fight
a previously undefeated cock which
was the. pride of the Chinese spbrting
element.
Upon being placed In the pit the
eagle went to sleep. The cock, full of
pepper, bravely handed his adversary
two blows. This was too much for
the marine mascot. He awoke from
his dream of the snow-capped Sierras
and deliberately pulled the chicken's
head off.
The sea-soldiers anticipate no fur
ther challenge.
Sounded Like Cussing When

La Crosse, Wis., Sept. 6. —Clerks in

the office. It sounded like an out
burst of profanity, but it was just a
salesman introducing himself to a
member of the company's staff.
The salesman was G. A. Tuhell, sell

The man he met was S. Damm,

BEAR CUB TRIPS DOWN MOUNTAIN

Dauphin, Pa., Sept. 13. All the
old bear yarns that could be remem

and once more Dauphin experienced
thrills. Why? Because yesterday aft

seen. Truly It was only a cub, but
nevertheless—a bear.
The cub was discovered by Thomas
Oarman of Brooklyn and Howard B.
Hummel, of Philadelphia, two boys
who are visiting relatives here. The
boys had gone up the Kittatinny moun
tain to a spring several hundred
yards above the home of Charles E.
Shaffer. Just as they reached the
spring they saw a black bear cub
jump back from the water, where it
had been drinking and run up the
mountain. The boys, too surprised

they searched for the bear, but could
not find It. The tracks It had made
at the spring, however, were very

According to reports in naval circles
the superdreadnaughts Pennsylvania
and Oklahoma in the firing last week
at the wreck of the San Marcos off
Tangier Island, established new world
records at twenty thousand yards, but
no official figures could be secured.
The Pennsylvania is said to have led

distance. The Oklahoma made tho
best record at 18,000 yards.
