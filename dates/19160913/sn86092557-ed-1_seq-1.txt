the lTnited States
has never had a fur
8 seal dressing and
dyeing industry.
American sealskins
have been
sent to London,
dressed and dyea
there, and then
shipped back to
America for sale,
incidentally paying
a tariff duty on the
imported furs, besides
bearing the
cost of double transportation
charges.
With the outbreak
of the Euroman
war agitation for starting an
American seal fur industry was started.
The department of commerce,
which through the bureau of fisheries
eontrols the seal herd of the Probiloff
elands, Alaska, decided to hold a salo
ef raw sealskins for the first time in
the United States. Prior to this sale,
be skins had always been sold In the
London market. The sale was a great
success. and led directly to the estabishment
of a new American industry,
whlhc is destined to save 52 per cent.
>f the prior cost of manufacturing seal
:urs. '
A firm of fur dealers in St. Louis <
was the pioneer in this industry, and '
s now dressing and dyeing 10,000 sealjkins
in its plant, using methods for- 1
nerly employed only in England. At I
:he same time it is rapidly extending <
Its plant, with the idea that the new '
ndustry shall become permanent. <
