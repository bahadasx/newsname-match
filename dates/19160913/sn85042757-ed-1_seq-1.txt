SPECIAL DAIRY TRAIN,
To Carry Southern Dairymen to Nation
al Dairy Show in New England.
Washington, D. C, September 10.
Arrangements have been made by the
Southern Railway to run a special train
carrying dairy farmers and others in
terested in the building up of the dairy
interests in the South to the National
Dairy Show to be held October 12-21 at
Springfield, Mass., at which the South
ern wi'l have an extensive exhibit giv
ing a full presentation' of the South as
a dairy section at the present time and
as a region for the future development
of the dairy industry.
The idea of I he special train from
the South to the dairy show, which is
held in the East for tne first time this
year, is to give Southern dairy farmers
an opportunity to see how the industry
is conducted in the North and to widen
their outlook by bringing them in con
tact with successful dairy farmers and
dairy workers from all parts of the
country. A general attendance at the
dairy show on the part of Southern
Dairymen is expected to do a great
deal to educate the people of the North
as to the advantages of the South for
the industry.
Pullman cars will be started from
central points in each state and will be
made into sx solid train into New York
and to Springfield. The sDecial will
start probably on Thursday, October
12, reaching New York on Saturday,
October 14.
Already nearly a hundred dairy farm
ers located from Virginia to Missis
sippi have i heated their intention to
become mer ers of the party.
New Enpi id people have contrib
uted $650,1101' for the erection of build
ing at the i w and more tnan 1.000
pure blood daily cattle ot the various
breeds will be on exhibit, besides a
comprehensive collection of the most
approved implements and machinery
used in connection with the dairy in
dustry.
In connection with the trip, arrange
ments are also being made for stop
overs and side trips to allow the Sojth
ern dairymen who go, to visit the most
interesting m ilk-producing centers of
the East, including the pasteurizing
and distributing plants at New York,
tne railroad warehouses in Jersey City
where over 2,000,000 quarts of milk are
shipped daily to New York by special
milk trains, the Mixter farm, an hour's
ride trom Spri igfteld, famous for the
breeding of pure bred Guernsey cattle,
and Washington where the party will
visit the United States Department of
Agriculture and the Bureau of Animal
Industry.
Mr. and Mrs. S. D. Williams, of
Watertown. have been here the past
fortnight visiting their daughter, Mrs.
W. A. Reed. They returned home yes
terday. Saturday Senator E. G. Tollett pick
ed a pint of well-ripened blackberries
from some tame vine3 in his garden.
The crop as a whole has oeen gone for
over a month. Prof. J. S. Cline also
informs us that in has picked ripe ber
ries several places in the county within
the past ten days. This is unusual.
Last week F. A. Loshbough cut a
good crop of soy benns, peas end mil
iett. From one acre ne cut 50 shocks.
An average shock was weighed and it
weighed 150 pounds. That would make
7,500 pounds ot hay as it came trom
the field. He estimates it will shrink
one-third by the time it is fully cured.
That would leave two and one-half tons
cured.

10DENDALE STOCK FARM
Hereford Cattle, Shropshire Sheep ana
Good Farming Methods.
Sunday we had the pleasure of visit
ing Lodendale Stock Farm, owned by
Harry Martin and lying three miles
west of town. Mr. Martin is an en
thusiast on the question of better blood
in live stock. On his farm he has 21
head of cattle that range trom one
fourth to three-fourths Hereford. No
where in the county have we seen a
more uniform herd of cattle nor cattlo
that showed greater results tor the
efforts put forth to improve the qual
ity. Mr. Martin has two three-qaarter
Hereford bull calves born last spring;
that are perfect beauties. He has been
offered $35 a head tor them and only
smiled at the offer for he well kuows
they are cheap at $50 each. He has
several heifers that will bring calves
the coming spring that are such per
fect specimens that no one would think
they are only three-quarters pure
blood. All told he has 35 head of cat
tle, including a pure blood bull, and all
show the Hereford markings plainly.
M'r. Martin is working to the end
where ho will have nothing in his herd
that is less than a half blood Hereford.
He has decided from observation and
experience that all things considered
the Hereford is the best cattle lor this
section.
He has 70 head of nearly pure blood
Shropshire sheep that he refused to
accept $7.00 a head for and had the
price named been ten dollars there is
no probability he would have accepted.
He has sold sheep and wool this year
amounting to $300 and has now a larger
and better flock of sheep than he had
in the spring.
On Lodendale Stock Farm we saw
corn that would easily pnduce 50
bushels to the acre. He has about 50
acres under cultivation of his farm of
200 acres.- He is making a model farm
and in a few years more there will be
tew if any farms in the county that
wiil surpass Lodendale.
Mr. Martin also has the Hampshire
or Belted Mortgage Litter hog and is
working as rap dly as possible to pure
bioods of that strain.
It is such farmers as Mr. Martin that
are doing the most lor the county
while making money for themselves.
The county would be much better if
we had more such farms as Lodendale
and such practical farmers as Harry
Martin. ,
ANOTHER SPLENDID FARM.
Adjoining Lodendalo Stock Farm G.
M. Martin has recently purchased v-hat
is known as the I'erry farm It con
sists of 200 acres and has some 60 to 75
acres of old lields and meadow land.
Mr. Martin is now preparing to turn
25 to 40 acres ot it this fall and other
wise improve the place in such ways as
will add greatly to its value.
There is no house on the farm but
from the old house site one can look
all over the farm ami it is almost
enough to make any lover ot farming
pine to own the place to look over
those broad acres and see the splendid
advantages it offers for building op
one of the most desirable stock farm
in the county.
ELECTION IN MAINE.
Much interest is being manifested in
the result of the election in Maine
which was held yesterday. It is an old
saying, "as Maine goes so goes the
nation."
The democrats are claiming the state
by 3,000 and the republicans by 15,000.
The campaign has been the hottest for
many years. Usually when the cam
paign is the hottest the republicans
win and when there is less interest
manifest the democrats frequently win.
Later The daily press brings the
news that the republicans have carried
Maine by 13,000 or more. They elected
two United States senators, all con
gressmen, a governor, tbe legislature
is strongly republican and many county
officers are the same. A veritable land
silde.
