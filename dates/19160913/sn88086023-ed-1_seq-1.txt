Underwood Plans
Court to Arbitrate
Labor Disputes
OSCAR UWDEJlVOODi
WASHINGTON, Sept, 13. Senator
Oscar Underwood or Alabama, mem
ber of the interstate commerce com
mittee, favors the passage of a law
by congress creating a court of arbi
tration, to which shall be referred all
labor disputes.
Senator Underwood urged an am
endment to the eight-hour bill giving
the interstate commerce commission
power to sit as such a court.
"I am a sincere friend of labor, and
desire to see it protected in all its
rights," says Senator Underwood. "1
believe in an eight hour day, but I
do not believe the railroad men have
obtained any especial benefit in the
so-called eight hour bill which we
passed. The danger that confronts
this country' will never be settled un
til congress enacts a general plan that
will amply protect all Interests In the
future provide for a court of arbitra
tion that will have power to interpret
Its verdict and enforce it, and give the
workmen and the managers a body
before which all disputes must be sub
mitted for the entertainment of the
facts and an award -based on these
facts.
