ETHEL CARLSON
TEACHER OF PIANO
New York City, June 15th, 1916
I take pleasure in recommending my pupil, Miss Ethel Carl
son, as a teacher. She is well acquainted with my ideas and
principles of musical and technical matters, and her own con
scientious work is the best guaranty for her success as a teacher.

MRS. WALTER JOHNSON.
The many friends of Mrs. Walter
Johnson, formerly Miss Laura Nel
son of Willmar, were grieved to learn
of her death in Tulsa, Okla., on Wed
nesday of last week, September 6th.
She had not been in good health for
a year or more, but the end came
rather suddenly and unexpectedly.
She was born in Atwater on Octo
ber 24, 1878, and lived there until
1895, when she moved to Willmar
with her parents. She married Mr.
Johnson on May 26, 1903, and a year
later they went to Oklahoma, where
she lived until her death. She had
malaria fever some five years ago and
was back in Willmar a couple of
times to visit She seemed to,feel
much better, but the disease again
seemed to get the upper hand and
finally resulted in her death.
The sympathy of the entire com
munity goes out to the husband, the
father, Mr. O. P. Nelson and a sister,
Mrs. N. T. Thompson of Atwater, and
to her other relatives and friends.
Music was furnished by the choir
of the First Methodist church, and
there were many beautiful floral of
ferings. She was buried in the fam
ily lot at Fairview cemetery.
MRS. ANNA SYVERSON.
Mrs. Anna Syverson died at her
home In the town of Rolling Forks,
Pope county, last Friday, Sept. 1,1916,
cause of death being cancer. She had
been ill about eighteen months.
The deceased, who was the widow
of the late Christian Syverson, was
an early settler of Pope county and
was loved and esteemed by all who
knew her. She is survived by three
sons, Martin, Alfred and Halvor, and
two daughters, Mrs. Adolph Hagen,
of North Dakota and Mrs. Roy Skin
ner of Glenwood also one sister, Mrs.
Shipstead of Willmar.
The funeral services were held
from the home Monday afternoon at
two o'clock, Rev. Beito, of the Chip
pewa Synod church, officiating. The
interment took place in the church
cemetery. The funeral was very large
ly attended.—Swift County Monitor.

CHANGE IN OIL DELIVERY
Merchants Have Arranged For Sep
arate Delivery of Kerosene
and Gasoline.
After careful consideration, we
have decided to discontinue the de
livery of kerosene and gasoline after
September 16, a* it is very hard to
handle oil in connection with groc
eries and meat.
We have taken this step in order
to give our patrons better service,
and have made arrangements with
Mr. Arnold Johnson to take over the
oil business. He will have a tank
with four compartments and will be
able to give you either Standard or
Bartles-Scott oil, which has been im
possible under the present system.
He will commence doing business on
Monday, Sept. 18, and will sell oil for
cash only, as that is the system all
oil companies use. We bespeak for
Mr. Johnson your kind consideration
and when in need of oil after Sept.
16, 'phone 731.
