issued a statement on the Maine elec

"The overwhelming defeat of the
Democratic forces in Maine indicates
how necessary lo Mi. Wilson will he
the ninety-one electoral voles in the
twelve Western States where women
vote 10 enable him to win in November.
We suuirest to Mr. Wilson that lie
take heed before it is too late and cull
a spceial session of Congress to pass
the national woman suffrage amend

to avert the vole against him and his
party in these twelve doubtful Western
States by the members of the Woman's
party."

THAT ( Al SKS AWIIITV
It is i.i.i the niei e terms of the Japa
nese demands, however, which have
heen well established throughout. so
much as their real purpose, that has
caused anxiety here. If the lecrudes
cetici of Mongolian banditry in con
junction with a monarchist revolution
has. as claimed, produced a condition of
outlawrj wheie Japanese lives are en
dangered. officials are said to be will
ing to admit that Japan is as much
justified in having troops in those sec
tions as the I'niteil States is in having
troops i". Mexico. If. on the other hand.
; .1. velop> that Japan is magnifying a
sn ail local disturbance into an inter
national complication to exact political
?once s.? ion.-, the I'nitcd States is ex
pected to object, hoblinc that the in
t c - i 11 > of C'lilna is being invaded.
In this connection ??iTidals note the
prompt ne.-s wiili which the Japanese
soldi i'- uer< on the scene, and the
fact that a few days later troops ap
pealed when a similar difficulty broke
...it at ihnoyanpo. seventy-five miles
inside the Mongolian border, and far
?wa* from an> railroad concession
where their presence is authorized.
While tli*- aits of reparation de
manded are thought very severe, and
are charaete risscd by Peking as hu
milinting, officials point out that this
is a matter between t'hitia and Japan
only I tn t the rights of police and
military advisers are international.
If Japan seeks merely an extension of
extra-territorial rights, officials assert
(.hat all other countries under the
"most favored nation" clause may do
likewise. That merely would mean
that all cases where a Japanese is a
defendant would be tried by a Japa
nese court applying the local Chinese
law.
WOII.lt SIIAIIK. WITH rillW
COi XTIIV'S AinilMSTIlATIIIN
In case the demands art coupled
with, a "special rights" clause, how
ever. as previously icported. it is
pointed out that Japan practically
will share with China the adminis
tration of that whole section to the
exclusion of all other powers. This
probably would be interpreted here
as a violation of the status ? 111?? as mu
tually guaranteed by this country and
Japan in the Hoot-Takaliira agree
ment. and a step toward the destruc
tion of t'hincse integrity.
Secretary l.ansing refused all com
ment to-day. even declining to indi
cate whether this government was
satisfied with the reports from Peking
and Tokyo, or would seek further in
formation. From what has been said
before, however, it is obvious tliat the
I'niteil Slates will in?iuirc further into
the situation, and follow* developments
with the closest scrutiny.

Within fifteen minutes after the

American commissioners, and escorted
to a great sun parlor, where the Mexl-j
can representatives awaited hint. For
half a n hour the President and six
commissioners chatted informally.

the L'nited States as leader of the
movement for free government and as 1
the tutor to whom Mexico must look'
in striving for the type of government
its people sought. Much hail been

to be accomplished before the aims of
the revolutions could be achieved.
In the morning hours, before the ex

considered reports submitted by the
Mexican members as to the political
'events which brought their ile facto
government into power In efiect. the
story which tin y are presenting is that
of Ca rranza's battle with Villa and
