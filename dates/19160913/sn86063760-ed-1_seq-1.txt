CONGRESSMEN ALL
HASTEN FOR HOME
ANXIOUS FOR REST OR PART IN
THE NATIONAL CAMPAIGN
WORK.
PRESIDENT'S STATEMENT
Gives Notice Remainder of Railroad
Program Will Be Pressed Next Sea
sion.-Three Other Important Meas
ures Go Over.
Washington.-Adjournment of Con
gress was quickly followed by a gen
eral exodus of members hastening
homeward for rest or the national
political campaign.
While the closing saw the adminis
tration legislative program mainly
completed some things wait to be
continued at the winter session notably
the remainder of the president's pro
gram of railroad legislation which was
partially enacted to prevent the threat
ened strike. In a formal statement
Piesident Wilson speaking of the work
of Congress, gave notice that the re
mainder of the railroad program would
be pressed at the new session.
The president's statement was as.
follows:
"A very remarkable session of Con
gress has just closed, full, as all re
oent sessions of the Congress have
been of helpful and humane legislation
which constitutes contributions of cap
ital Importance to the defense, the eco
nomic progress and the wholesome life
of the country.
"It is to be regretted that the ses
sion could not have continued long
enough to complete the program re
cently projected with regard to the ac
commodition of labor disputes be
tween the railways and the employes,
but it was not feasible in the circum
stances to continue the session any
longer and therefore only the most im
mediately pressing parts of the pro
gram could be completed.
"The rest, it is. agreed, has merely
oeen postponed until it can be more
maturely deliberated and perfected.
I have every reason to believe that it
is the purpose of the leaders of the
two houses immediately upon the re
assembling of Congress to undertake
this additional legislation. It is evi
dent that the country should be re
lieved of the anxiety which must have
been created by recent events with re
gard to the future accommodation of
such disputes."
The immigration bill, the corrupt
practices bill and the bill to permit
combinations of American exporters to
meet foreign competition abroad went
overt.
The closing hours of Congress were
remarkably quiet. Only the presence
of the president in his room, near the
Senate chamber, served to attract in
terest to what otherwise would have
been en uneventful ending of an event

Good Roads Day In Chester.
Chester.-The greatest single day
probably in Chester's long history suc
cesfully terminated last week. It
was good roads day, which the Ches
ter chambei- of commerce had been
busily engaged in boosting for the past
month. The entire county worked in
unison. For the past few weeks eachi
township had been organized so that
on the appointed day the work should
go forward without any delay.
Repor-ts coming in to the chamber
of commerce indicated that 3,000 men
and 500 teams worked the roads. The
city of Chester loaned many teams.;
Practically every business and profes
sional man in Chester who was unable:
to use a pick or shovel contributed a
dollar. Needless to state this sum
grew to rather large proportions and
It was used to hire teams, etc.I
In a number of places stretches of
new road were built and hundreds of
holes in the roads were covered.
