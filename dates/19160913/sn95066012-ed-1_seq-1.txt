French Capture Trenches on Var
dar River
BULGARIANS QUIT KAVAIA
Port on Aegean Sea Captured In
August Von Mackensen Push
ing Into Rumania.
London, Sept, 12. All along the
Macedonian front the heavy offensive
of the entente allies continues. Bui
gurian trenches on a front of two
miles and to a depth of 800 yards are
reported hy Paris to have been cap
tured by the French west of the Var
dar river near Majadagh which lies
about four miles south of the town of
Glevgeli. On the Struma front the
British, aided by the French. have
made additional gains cast of the riv
er in the Lake Takinos region. The
army of the Teutonic allies is declared
to have suffered heavy casualties in
the latter engagement.
Unofficial reports are to the effect
that the Bulgarians have evacuated
the forts at Kavala, on the Aegean
sea, which they captured in August.
While the presence of entente allied
warships off the town is given as the
reason for the withdrawal it is not
improbable that the menace of the
new drive of the British and French
along the Struma front may have
been partly responsible for it.
Berlin reports further progress for
the German and Bulgarian forces un
der command of Field Marshal van
Mackenvsen in the Dobrudja region of
eastern Kuniunia.
Attacks by the Russians in east
Oalicia and on the lower Stokhod riv
er in Russia have been repulsed by
the Austro-German forces, according
to Berlin und Vienna. Petrograd re
port! that in the Carpathians the Rus
sians have captured several additional
strategic positions, but Vienna denies
the assertion and declares that all at
tacks there were repulsed.
The usual bombardments and small
skirmishes continue In the AUStro
Italian theater. The Turks and Rus
sians are still at grips In Asiatic
Turkey with both sides claiming suc
cesses. ZAIMIS CHANGES MIND
Greek Premier Hands in Resignation,
but Withdraws It.
London. Sept. 13. A Reuter dis
patch from Athens says that the re
port that Premier Zaimis has tendered
his resignation is officially confirmed
and that every effort Is being made to
persuade him to Withdraw It. An
other dispatch from Athens says that
Premier Zalmis offered his resigna
tion to King Constant ine Monday af
ternoon. He pleaded that nwinu to
the constant dllllcultles arising of late
he was unable to carry out negotia
tions of the greatest importance lo
Greece and Which were imperative at
the present moment. Al the request
of the king and on receiving an ex
presslon of confidence from the rep
rnsentatives of the entente ministers

resignation.
Several members of the Zaimls
cabinet called at the palace yester
day morning and Insisted that it was
impossible for the ministry to remain
In power, says a dispatch from
Athens. The belief Is now held in
official circles that a cabinet crisis

New York, Sept. 13. A memoran
dum recommending that New York's
transit strike be terminated immedi
ately and that conferences between
ti action officials at New York and
union representatives be held, with a
view to agreeing on arbitration, was
issued late yesterday by Mayor Mit-
chel and the public service commis

horouuh rapid transit company an
nounced at New York last night that
he will not accept the recommenda
tion to call off the strike and arbi
trate the differences between the I, ill
way Companies and the labor union.
Alter Mayor Mitchel and the public
service commission had taken steps
to terminate the strike, plans to con
tin lit- and extend the strike were dis-
ussed last night at a meeting of the
I'nlted labor conference oi central
bodies of Greater New York. Follow
ing the conference. Hugh Frayne, New-
York state organizer of the American
federation of labor, issued a state
ment as follows: "The consensus of
opinion among the members of the var
Ions organizations represented was
I hat the ra ill oad officials must be met
with the sort of force they are apply
ing to the men." Frayne declared that
the United Hebrew trades were repre
sented in the conference lor the first
time. These trades, it is said have a
membership of 200,000.
Representatives of the strikers an
nouiiced last night they would not
continent on the plans of the mayor
and the police service commission to
have the strike arbitrated until they

STATE BUYS TROUT POND
J. Heat hy Sells Marlboro South

he transfer during the past week
by
riiomas .1. Ileaphy of Montpelior of
his summer place and interest at
Marlhoio South pond, which is situa
ted a few miles from Brattleboro, has
created much Interest.
Mr. Ileaphy has transferred all of
his rights there, Which Included 2"
acres ot laud aim tour nuts oi land an
mound the pond. Which contains about
l'.n acres. This was all the land and
rights that Mr. Heaphy acquired from
the Vermont front and salmon club In
!00. This club was h Windham coun
ty organization to make South poud
into a private fishing pond for nicm
ben of the club.
Mter extending litigation in the
Windham OOtttH COUrtl and Supreme
court, it was held that the pond was
public waters and could not be closed
When the club became defunct Mr.
Ileaphy bought out the int Tests of
the members.
There Is some speculation as to who
Is to be the new ow ner of the poll I.
Mr. Ileaphy transferred the property
to John W. Titcomb, who is slate llsh
and game-1 ommissioiier. and it was
made out to Benjamin Gates, secre
tary to Hie governor, so it Is thought
that the pun base may have been
made in the interest of the state fish
and game, department.
It Is quite generally understood that
plans are being formulated by parties
Interested to erect at least 60 cot
(ages al the pond tor use next summer
and t hut they will be rented to a col
ony of people from New York.
Further development is bound to
tnkv place In this section If a large
colony of New York people are indue
oil lo come to Marlboro South pond to
spend (he summers.
This pond fs situated so near Ames
hill, which has already become so pop
ular as a summer resort, that It will
undoubtedly mean the further (level

CAK1MKE
FIRST VERMONTER HAS A ZOO
M. C. A. Leader Tells of Interest
ing Collection Already Made.
Henry 11. Chapman, who is in
charge of the Y. M. C. A. building of
the First Vermont Infantry at Kagle
ass. Tex., writes to The Middlehury
Register as follows:
"To the Kditor of The Register:
think that the readers of The
Register would be interested in an ac
count of the small zoo we are main
taining. It affords much amusement
to the men, and is interesting from Un
scientific point of view. It comprises
quite a variety of animals:
I doubt if
even Barnaul k Bailey
could show
anything just like it.
The nucleus of this unparalleled
collection of live stock was a horned
toad which was brought in one day
and given to Mr. Brown, it was small
er than some of the garden toads that
we have at home, and about as hand
some as a Chinese idol, but perfectly
liaimless. A few days afterward a
small desert turtle was brought In.
and Mr. Brown made a small cage for
the two. It wasn't long before the
men began to bring in all the speci
mens that they could lay hands on,
ind Mr. Brown had to build a larger
cage, one nay me cnapiain tame in
with a bundle in his hand, and said,
Colonel Reeves presents his compli
ments, and sends you another horned
toad.' We had three already, but this
was the largest we had seen, larger
than any of our garden toads, and
twice as hoiuelv. They are found in
all sizes, from one that you could
cover with a twenty-live cent piece, to
one as large or larger than
bull
tro.
"AHer some time a gopher or ground
squirrel was added to our mob of
turtles and horned toads, and then tin
men had something really interesting
and amusing to look at. I was a de
light to watch him dart around tin
cage, or sit up and eat the meaquitl
beans and bread which we fed bin,
holding them in his paws, and comb
ing his whisker's after each meal. A
few days ago another gopher was
brought In, and the two are pretty
good chums.
"We. did have a large crayfish which
was caught in a pond not far from the
camp, but it didn't last long in cap
tivitv. We also had a hue large cen
tipede Which We put In the small cake
which Mr. Brown llrst made. We
thought that it couldn't possfhly get
out. but tlie next morning it was gone
However, there was ine in a ditch
outside the building which looked OS
actly like the fisst one. We put It in
a boy but it also got away, and we
haven't seen it since. We hve a dead
one which one of the officers pinned
to a stick after taking it to the hos
pltal and having it chloroformed. I
will not describe it in detail, as then
is nothing in the appearance of the
creature to appeal to one s sense oi
the beautiful. It is enough lo say that
the color scheme is red. black and
yellow, and that they are much
linger than the little brown centipi
des we sometimes see in Vermont.
wouldn't recommend them as pets tor
children.
"Besides the other animals that
have mentioned we have a small ral
bit. a young sparrow and a hound
with a litter of seven pups; not all in
the same (age, hy the way. The pii
pies ure In a corner of th" office, and
the rabbit and the bird are In thi
small cage, where they live together
on the best of terms. The hild v ill
erch on Mr. Brown's linger and eat

This afternoon there was a fight
between one of the gophers ami
homed toad. This particular toad
had a vicious disposition, and when
ever one of the gophers came near
would make a dash at the gopher
though It couliin t possitiie do any
damage. This happened several limes
in the post, ami today the gopher got
his lighting blood up. I won't ft
what lie did to the toad. I had to
take the latter outside and put an end
to its sufferings.
"The turtles have orange and Mac
shells which would he quite ornament

SIDE JUOGSHIP III
IHIS COUNTY IS
TIGHT RUN
Three Candidates Are All Closely
Bunched
RESULT IS STILL NOT CERTAIN
La Franchise Ran Well in Bennington
But Was Cut Somewhat in the
Smaller Towns.
Bennington comity cast a smaller
vote proportionately than any other
part of the state yesterday owing to
the absence of local contests. Paue
carried the county by a plurality of
over fiOti and had a majority of nearly
51)0 over both Fletcher and Gates.
The only contest in this county was
over assistant judge and it developed
into a close ' thing. The candidates
were Kdmond l,a Franchise of Ben
nington, ii. N. Shaw of Manchester
and Dexter M Gieason of Woodford.
The smaller towns seemed lo think
that Bennington ought not to have a
candidate and voted rather strong lor
Gieason while Bennington gave La
Franclilse a lead of llo and Manches
ter a margin of H8 which evened the
tiling up to where (he . three candi
dates were running neck and neck.
At 2.30 this afternoon tho indica
tions were that Shaw and La Fran
chise jrere nominated for assistant
judges, but It was not certain as re
Krts had not been received from Sun
