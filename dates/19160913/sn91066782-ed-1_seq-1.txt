Pari. Sept. 13. Th French captured
the village- of Bouchavesnes on the
Pomme front in the region of Combles
from the Germans last night, it was offi
cially announced to-day. The French
also took by assault a wood 600 yards
fast of the road from Pcronne to Beth
wne. On the Verdun front the French
made progress in the northern part of
the Vaux-Chapitre road.
Remarkable French Air Activity.
Numerous aerial engagements and
raids 'by French aviators on points be
hind tlie German lines were reported in
to-day!, otlirial statement, which says
that on the Homme front French aero
jilaiien fought Beventern engagements
. yesterday. Two Germnn machines were
brought down and four other enemy ma
chines appeared to be badly damaged.
( out inning, the statement says: "Last
night our bombing squadrons dropped 87
bombs on railroad stations and small
buildings at Guiscard, 24 bombs on the
railroad station and depots at Gendri-
t-ourt, 74 bombs on the enemy installa
tions in the region of Eta in, 32 on biv
ouacs around Dambillcrs and six shots
on Monmedye station, 105 bombs on
Theionville station and 60 on the Vor
jingen iron foundries and a small num
ber elsewhere. '
London, Sept. 13. Resuming their of
fensive to the north of the Somme river
in France, the French forces have again
smashed the German line, captnTcd front
line and other trenches, and taken about
1,500 prisoners.
The new attacks coming after several
days of comparative calm in the region
where for weeks past violent righting
liad been in progress, were made on the
front from the town of Combles to the
river. So vicious was the thrust of the
French that it required only half an hour
for them to overcome the resistance of
the Germans and make themselves mas
ters of three and three-quarter miles of
first line trenches.
Later east and southeast of Combles
they seized additional trenches along the
Eethune-Peronne road, which leads
from Pcronnc northward through Ba
paume and Arras to Bethune, placing a
6erious impediment in the way of the
Germans for the movement of their
transport from the north to Peronne and
making the French position north of
Peronne seemingly a menacing one.
All along the Macedonia front the
"heavy offensive of the entente allies con
tinue.s. Bulgarian trenches on a front of
4wo miles and to a depth of 800 yards
are reported by Paris to have been cap
tured by the French west of the Vardar
river near Majadagh, which lies about
four miles south of the town of Giev
peli. On the Struma front the British,
Bided by the French, have made addition
si gains east of the river in the Lake
Takinos region. The army of the Teu
tonic allies is declared to have suffered
lieavy casualties in the latter engage-
RESIGNATI0N ACCEPTED

Athens, Sept. 12, vis London (delayed),
sept, 13. King t'oiitnfuie ha accept
ed the retaliation of Premier Xaimia
and hi cabinet.
The belief i entertained in the entente
capital that the retirement of the .aiiui I
ministry is preliminary to the entrance
of Greece into the war mi the aide of
the allies lie. cut dispatches from Iter
lin and Vienna how also that it in r
garded there as probable, that Greece
will abandon her neutrality and join
with the enemies of the central power.
Ihe precise causes that led to the reig
nation of the cabinet have not Ih-cu dm
cloed on account of the exceptionally
rigid censorship. It is believed In Lou
don that tl a resignation is due to the
fact that he accepted the. premiership on
the understanding that he was to main
tain neutrality and that in irw of the
Bulgarian occupation of Greece tcrri
tory found this impossible.

New London, Conn., Sept. 13. The na
val yacht Mayflower, witli President
Wilson aboard, steamed out of the har
bor this morning, taking the president
back to the summer White House at
Ixng Branch, X. ,T.
The president decided to leave New
I-ondon last night, after the physicians
attending his sirter, whose critical ill
ness brought him here, advised him that
from now on Mr. Howe would be con
stantly under the influence of opiates,
would be unable to recognize him and
might live for several days. Should
there be a sudden turn for the worse, the
president plans to return immediately.

Unofficial reports are to the effect that

they captured in August.
SERBIANS PROGRESS.
Because of Presence of Many Policemen
on Car Line.
New York, Sept. 13. Interest in the
street railway strike centered to day in
the meeting of the public service commis
sion at which the traction officials and
the strike leaders will make a formal
reply to the recommendations of the
commission for the immediate suspension
of the strike and the settlement of the
questions at issue by arbitration. The
leaders of both sides have both unofficial
ly announced their intention of rejecting
the commission's recommendation..
Only a few surface cars were oper
ated to-day. Passengers were forced to
use the subways and the elevated with
the result that there was extreme con
gestion at the express stations. There
was little violence during the night due
to the fact that policemen were sta
tioned on the roof tops where heretofore
attacks on the elevated trains had their
inception.
Mayor Mitehel is considering request
ing Governor Whitman to call a special
session of the legislature to pass a law
compelling both sides to accept arbitra
tion. Another plan of the mayor is the
immediate granting of a franchise to the
New York Bus Co., to operate through
certain streets.
The Interborough Rapid Transit Co.
and the New York Railways Co. later
formally rejected the commission's rec
ommendations and announced that they
would decline to hold further conferences
with union representatives but would
continue to operate their lines on the
present basis.
LEG BROKEN AT ANKLE.
James Ewen of Orange Street Sustained
Serious Fracture.
James Ewen of Orange street sustained
the fracture of the left leg at the ankle
this afternoon. He wag employed at
Barclay Bros.' stoneshed and started to
step from a flat car to a pile of stones
when he slipped and fell a short dis
tance, twisting the ankle in such a man
ner as to make a serious fracture. The
young man was taken to the City hos
pital at once for treatment.
WAITSFIELD.
Burlington. Sept. 13. While laboring
under the delusion that her brother-in-
law, John Deyette, was trying to defame
her character by spreading stories about
her. Miss Ruse Willets crept up to a
window in Deyette's coal office on lower
Champlain street this morning and fired
two bullets at the man as he sat in a
chair reading a newspaper. After mere
lv wounding Pcvette slightly, the girl
tnrned the weapon on herself and killed
herself on the spot.
Hie two Willets girls came to Burling
ton from Detroit a few years ago and
solicited for a booklet. Both were good
looking and made rapid progress with
their work. Latterly .John Peyette fell
in love with One of them and married her.
Mr. and Mrs. Peyetfe live on Monroe
street, while Miss Willets resided with
her mother, Mrs. Rose P. Willet, on
Main street. There does not seem to
have been any ground for the girl's de
lusion that Deyette was defaming her
character. Peyette n well known here,
w here he is engaged in the coal business.
However, the voting ladv, who was 23
yearn--of age, nursed the grievance and
finally became lieside herself. All that
saved Peyette from death was the fact
that the glass in the window of his of
fice slightly deflected the course of the
bullets which the girl fired, one bullet
merely making a flesh wound in one
cheek and the other grazing one leg and
then dropping down in Peyette's shoe.
Peyette will recover promptly. The girl
died 15 minutes after turning the weap
on on herself.

Routine matters occupied the alder

evening, the only discussion coming when
the opera house contract with John Ho

man Hoe si objected to the clause al
lowing the house to lc rented to local

was enough inasmuch as the present

So closely did three of the four candi
dates for the Republican nominations for
Washington county senator run in yes
terday's primary that the returns from
all the in towns were necessary to deter
mine that Bert rand It. Pcimritt of Dux
bury had defeated Henry F. Hill of Wa
terbury and that.F. F.. Steele of Montpe
er had gone ahead of both those candi
dates and tood next to Frank C. Han
croft of Rarre Town, who ran the high
est of the quartet.
The unofficial returns this afternoon
indicated that with all the 20 towns
heard from Pemeiitt was leading Hill by
a srsnt margin of a dozen votes, l,.Viti
to 1,544. while Steele had reached a total
of 1.700 with three towns lacking. With
those same towns lacking Bancroft had a
total of I,!!!).
Another county ticket contest was
over assistant judge of county court, a ml
for a tune the figures ran close and it
seemed that K. B. House of Berlin would
tand a chance of being one of the two
nominees. Mrr returns enabled George
If. Pale of Waterbury and Charles 11.
Iana of .Woodburv to run ahead, so that
there seemed no doubt of their success in
tlie primary.
The tabulated returns on the county
senatorial light are as follows:
