STRIKE PROMISES TO
BE FIGHT TO FINISH
Traction Officials Declare
Company Has AH the Best
of It and Will Not
Arbitrate.
International News Serviee;
NFAV YOKK. Sept. 13. Discovery
in, the Brooklyn section of the In
terhoroiiKh Rapid Transit Co.'s sub
way of a package declared by an ex
plosive expert to be blasting dyna
mite, led the police to believe today
that an effort has been made by
strike sympathizers to blow up the
subway. Traction ofticials have sev
eral times since the strike began
expressed fear that such an attempt
would be made and the track walk
ers have been daily warned to watch
closely.
The package was found about 500
feet from the borough station. It
was lyins; just inside one of the
rails where it miht be hit by the
Hange on the jvheel of a car passing
above it.
As soon as it was turned over to
the police they called in a member
of the Ftaff of the bureau of com
bustibles. He immediately declared
it blasting dynamite. This was de
nied by an employe of the traction
company and the pac kage was finally
sent to the main ofliee of the bureau
of combustibles for detailed analysis.
right to finish.
That the strike would he a fight
to a finish was the declaration made
by the leaders on both sides today.
The traction officials announced
they would attend the meeting which
the public service commission had
called, but emphatically asserted
that they would reject the proposal
of arbitration lipon which the com
mission had agreed n.s a means of
terminating the strike.
"We have all the best of It," said
one traction chief. "Why should we
arbitrate when we have won the
strike. It was brought by the union
and the company Sves no reason
why it should in any way even ap
pear to admit responsibility for a
condition for which it was in no
way liable."
The labor leaders were as defiant
as the traction oMioials and asserted
they would make no concessions at
the commission meeting.
"We are fichtinc: for our life the
rittht to organize," said TluCh
Frayne. state organizer of the
American federation of labor. "We
will not surrender anything that
mistht jeopardize that risrht."
Outbreaks Are Feared.
The situation on this, the sixth
day of the strike, seemed fraught
with even greater menace than at
any previous time. Charging that
the Tnterborousth officials had failed
to use "orderly methods" in their
efforts to break the strike, the
strikers declared that "force must
be met with force."
This implied threat caused fear to
arise that there woi:!J be even
greater violence than yesterday,
wlun Chief Inspector Schmittberger
ordered the p lice to use their re
volvers in case of attacks upon
traction property or employes.
Service on the subway and ele
vated lines was practieall normal
today, but there was no than -re in
the condition of paralysis on the
i; I face lines.

BUTTLE ON COIL

Government Has Completed
Plans For Final Effort to
Break Combine.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Sept. 13. The
department of justice has completed
its plans for its final effort to break
up the combination between eastern
railroads and anthracite coal pro
ducers. Early next week the govern
ment will tile its briefs in the su
preme court of the United States in
the actions against the Lehigh Val
ley Railroad Co. and the Heading
Co. The latter is the holding com
pany which holds the securities of
the Philadelphia and Heading Co.
and its subsidiary concerns, which
dominate many coal mines.
The Iehigh Valley likewise owns
many coal mines, the government
alleges, and it holds thus control il
legal as tending to stifle competi
tion. The department of justice will tell
the high court that by means of in
terlocking directorates the railroad
and coal companies have been able
to maintain a tight combination in
restraint of trade. This, the depart
ment will argue, is in defiance of the
Sherman law.
The directors sitting on both the
iailroad and coal companies boards
are among the biggest Wall st.
financiers. The finest legal talent
available has been engaged on both
sides to light out the issue and ar
rangements are to be made by the
government for the advancement of
the case for consideration and .if
possible, decision early in the Oc
tober term of the supreme court.
