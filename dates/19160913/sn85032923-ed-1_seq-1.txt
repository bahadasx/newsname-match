CAR IS WRECKED.
NEW YORK, Sept. 12. The first
serious accident of the street railway
strike in this city occurred early to
day when a trolley car of the Union
Railway Company in the Bronx, opcr
ated by a ''green" motorman, got 'be
yond control on a steep grade and
jumped the (rack at a curve and crash
ed into two jitney buses, killing two
persons and severely injuring 13
others.
Four of the injured may die.
The car crew was arrested pending
investigation.
After a night of intermittent riot
ing, motormcn on the Sixth and Ninth
avenue elevated roads reported to the
police that they had been fired upon
by strikers from roof tops.
Third avenac -eh-vated- trains were
repeatedly bombarded with bricks and
stones from buildings. One passen
gcr, a woman, was struck on the head
and seriously injured. Five arrests
were made.
The congestion on the subway and
elevated roads today was even more
pronounced than yesterday, due to
the fact that there was little or no
service on the surface lines of Man
hattan and The Bronx. Not a car
wheel moved in the Westchester cities
of Yonkcrs, Mount Vernon and New
Rochellc.
Violence continued as the day went
on. Strikers and their sympathizers
halted surface cars and set upon the
crews of strikebreakers when the lat
ter refused to desert their posts.
Nearly 100 strikebreakers, most of
them from Chicago and Boston, ap
pealed to Mayor Mitchcl and the pub
lic service commission, claiming that
none of the promises made when they
were engaged had been kept and that
they were virtually prisoners in car
barns.
They alleged that armed guards
prevented them from leaving and that
wages due them were not forthcom
ing. The mayor promised them po
lice protection in their efforts to col
lect wages.
Representatives of the strikers an
nounced they would not comment on
the plans of the mayor and public

TRAIN ROBBERS

GOV. HUNT WINS RE
PHOENIX, Sept. 13. At 1 o'clock
this morning with meager returns
only from the larger counties it is
evident that Hunt has been renomin

majority. Olncy will carry this coun

for the Supreme court, Jones for at
torney general, Osborn for secretary
of State, Bolin for mine inspector,
Case for superintendent of public in
struction, Bctts for corporation com
missioner, and Howe for tax com
missioner. Boyce for auditor was
without contest.
Kibbcy has been nominated by the
Republicans for U. S. senator and
probably Eads for representative in
congress.
COUNTY OFFICE CONTESTS
With only partial returns from city

McSwiggin for the nomination ol
county recorder on the Democratic
ticket. At the latest reports Mrs.
Ruffncr was leading by a slight mar
gin.
Although Colonel Fred Bowler,

ardent supporters, it appears that

DISAGREE OVER
THE CAUSE OF
DIFFERENT REASONS ARE
GIVEN BY SURVIVORS
FOR THE COLLAPSE OF
BIG BRIDGE.
QUEBEC, Sept. 12. The St. Law
rence Bridge Company and the Que
bec bridge commission arc conduct
ing a joint investigation into the col
lapse of the central span of the Que
bec cantilever bridge over the St.
Lawrence river, where it was being
hoisted into position.
The death list remains at 11.
Accounts of survivors of the disas
ter and spectators arc at hopeless
variance, some holding that the span
itself buckled first, and others that
the hoisting supports did not work
uniformly, thereby throwing too much
strain on the supports.
Engineers in charge of the con
struction work said today that as
soon as the cause of the accident is
ascertained, the work of cither re
constructing a new span or raising
the collapsed one would be under
taken. It was estimated the work will cost
$1,000,000.
