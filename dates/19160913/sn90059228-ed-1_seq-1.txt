Joihii I. Skurdahl, one of the well
'Mt known farmers near the city, raised
22 bushels of wheat to the acre on a
twenty acre tract, the quality being

North Star College Notes
The HighSchool is now in session
in our building. Teachers and stu
dents have no trouble in getting lo
cated in our new buildig.
Mrs. Phil Sundby and husband, of
Minneapolis, have been dsiting
friends in the city for some time.
Mrs. Sundby's maiden name was
Miss Olive Wahlund and at one time
she was a student of North Star
Co1
Miss Judith Peterson, of Alvara
do, and Axel E. Johnson, of Vega,
both graduates of North Star, have
returned to Gustavus Adolphus Col
lege to resume their work in the
College department. Thus we see
that our school has already become
a "feeder" to the mother school,
Gustavus Adolphus.
The W. C. T. U. of this city will
entertain in honor of the new
teachers at the College building Fri
day evening, Sept. 22.
Miss Hildur Ranstrom, Stenogra

with County Auditor Lundgren in
his office.
Harold Bartholow has decided to
pursue the stenographic course in
connection with his work in the high

Inquiries are coming in every
mail. We hope that every inquiry
will mean a student for our school.
Those who have not yet received
our latest catalog should make this
fact known. Write us a card today
and ask for one and in it you will
find the information you are seek
ing.
Arthur Sjoblom, of Stephen, was

HAS HERD OF DEER
NEAR FERTILE, MINN.
A herd of deer feeding peacefully
in a pasture near the farm house is
rather an unusual sight even among
of northern Minnesota. However, it
is to be met with daily at the Gil
bert Lee place, eight miles north of
Fertile. Mr. Lee is one of the pio
neers settlers of this part of the
county and the call of the wild is
by no means departed from his na
ture. A short time ago he secured
two fawns from the miles to the
eastward and last fall had a three
year-old buck shipped him from a
herd at New Ulm. During the
spring and early summer two fawns
appeared so that the herd is now in
creased to five, The fawns with
their beautiful mottled coloring are
pretty, graceful creatures. Their
peaceful, dainty dispositions maka
them exceedingly interesting, as in
deed are the grown-ups as well, all
of which are so tame as to come up
and eat out of one's hand.
Buys Imported Percheron.
Joel Engelstad has unloaded an
imported Percheron horse which
was shipped up from Illinois. This
is one of the finest horses that ever
walked through the streets of War
ren. He was taken out on the N. R.
Engelstad farm, four miles south of
town, and will be kept there through
the winter, and next spring will
make stands around Warren. Those
interested in good horses should not
fail to see this horse before they
engage a horse next spring as he
has the size, bone and build that a
horse should have.

Nominee Declares Failure of Peace
ful Settlement is Near to
Government Abdication.
Hampton Beach, N. H., Sept. 7.
Charles E. Hughes in an address
here to-day referred to the Adamson
law "not as an eight hour a day

that failure of peaceful settlement
of industrial disputes was but
"another step, from the abdication
of government itself." His audi
ence applauded loudly.
"We cannot afford to surrender
what we have won for our institu
tions in this country," the nominee
said. "What have we won? We
have won the right to free discus

STORE BURNED.
The postoffice and store at Fork
was destroyed by fire last Thursday
night about one o'clock. All the
equipment of the postoffice and the
stock of general merchandise were
consumed by the flames in a short
space of time. I. Arness, the post
master and proprietor sustains a
loss of over $2,000. It is believed
that the fire was caused by mice or
rats gnawing at some explosive ma
terial left over from July 4th and
stored in the warehouse.
Hunting Season is Now On.
This city was practically deserted
the latter part of last week on ac
count of the opening of the hunting
season on Thursday. Some parties
who were out returned with the
limit, -which is ten, but others came
back with only three or four birds
and some without any. There were
not as many hunters from other
cities as in former years, one rea
son for this being the reported fact
that chickens are scarce in these
parts this year. If a game reserve
were established .in Marshall county,
it would help preserve the game, or
a law might be passed permitting
chicken hunting only every second
year. As the slaughter is carried
on now with dogs and long range
guns, not enough chickens are left
at the end of the hunting season for
seed for next year's crop.

THIEF LAKE NOW
BEING DRAINED.
Big Project Completed and Waters
of Red Lake River Raised
Considerably as Result.
Thief Lske, a body of water five
miles long and three wide, will soon
be drained and its bed will be occu
pied by fine farms. The work of
dredging, which has been going on
for a year, has been completed, and
the first of the drainage wrters
reached here sometime last night.
Red Lake river at this point is con
siderable higher and veiy maddy as
a result.
A rather unusual condition was
encountered in this drainage project.
Thief Lake is the outlet for the
Moose river flowing from the east,
and the bed of this stream is con
siderably lower than the bed of the
lake. It was therefore necessary to
run a canal of the same depth as
the river through the center of the
lake to the outlet, which is the
source of the Thief river. There is
also considerable of a ridge at this
point, and it was necessary to cut
through this in order to get to a
level with the bottom of the canal.
The work was done by the Kohler
Contracting company, having a sub
contract from the Northwestern
Diainage company of this ctiy.
Hunting Ground Gone.
The drainage of Thief lake will
destroy the finest duck and goose
hunting section in the north. The
region has been a sportsman para
dise since the days when the Indian
was monarch of all he surveyed and
strong protests were filed against
the project for this reason. Drying
up the lake will, however, make
available for cultivation one of the
most fertile sections of land in the
state and is justified from every
point of view.Thief River Falls
Times.
We are not familliar with con
ditions at Thief Lake, but we have
heard a number of Marshall county
people deplore the fact that the
county is to be deprived of its only
lake. Furthermore, we have been
told that the bottom of the lake is
of such character that it will never
make good agricultural land. How
ever, we presume that the state and
county authorities have looked^ ^"f
thoroughly into the matter and have
found that the benefits resulting to
adjacent lands from draining the
lake more than overbalances all det
riments from a utilitarian, aesthetic
and sentimental point of view.
Good bye, Thief Lake!
