REVIEWS PRESIDENT'S TRIALS
Lifelong Republican and a Strong
Supporter Of Roosevelt's
Candidacy.
UKAT IXVKXTOK SPEAKS OUT
The following was taken from the
Philadelphia North American, one
of the stalwart Republican newspa
pers of the country, bearing date of
September 4, 1916: '
Saratoga, N. Y., Sept. 3. Thomas
A. Edison, Inventor, lifelong Repub
lican and a strong supporter of The
odore Roosevelt's candidacy for the
Republican nomination, made an
nouncement to-day of his intention
to vote and work for Woodrow Wil
son. He said:
"Not tince 18C0 has any campaign
made s.uch a direet call on simon
pure Americanism. The times are
too serious to talk or think in terms
of Republicanism or Democracy.
Keal Americans must drop parties
and get down to big, fundamental
principles.
"More than any other President
In my memory, Wilson has been
faced by a succession of tremendous
problems, any one of which decided
the wrong way would have had dis
astrous consequences. Wilson's de
cisions so far have not put us Into
any serious trouble, nor are they
likely to. X
"He has given us peace with hon
or. This talk about the United
States being despised is nonsense.
.Neutrality lsa mighty trying policy,
but back of it are International law,
tho rights of humanity and the fu
ture of civilization.
"With reference to Mexico, I
think that the President has acted
wisely, justly and courageously. It
was right that he United States
ltnolil tint linifn nnriAntlNnil pilili t I
murderous personality as nueriu. i
do not believe that we should have
.Jrtitervpned nor do I bellovo that we
'should Intervene now.
"Mexico Is a troublesome neigh
bor Just now, but war and conquest
is not going to make her a better
JJzie. Both against England and
against human slavery tho United
States worked out Its salvation'
through revolution, 'and It was a
pretty slow, trying process.
"It has been said that Wilson at
first was against preparedness. Per
haps he was, but when convinced
that Intelligent public opinion was
overwhelmingly In favor of It h
changed. That Is tho proper thing
for our Presidents to do. A Presi
dent defiant of public opinion would
bo a dangerous man In our system
of government.
"His attitude on tho atriff shows
an oqual openness of mind. A tariff
commission will take the whole
problem out of politics. It Is my
hope that experts will bo named, and
that the body will bo continuing and
vested almost with the dignity of tho
Supreme Court.
"They say Wilson has blundered.
Perhaps ho has. But I notice thnt
ho usually blunders forward. You
can't get 100-per-cent efficiency In a
democracy. I don't know that wb
ought to want it. We would bo ma
rhines, and wo would have to sac
rifice too much of freedom.
"As I said at tho start, it has been
just one hlg thing after another for
Wilson. I hnvo uever known so
many dangerous questlous brought
up for decision to any one President.
Latest ho had the general strike of
tho skilled railway men. which. If
D..Uu.u ,.u. ..aD .b. DUw. ".eecond ,)rlze Kenneth Enoch
curried out, would have thrown the
whole country Into confusion and
proven a calamity that, in curtain
eventualities, would havo had results
hound to extond over a long period
Tot time. Ho acted with his usual
courago and sanity,
"In my opinion, Mr. Hughe, It
president, would havo found It dlf
Tfculf to decldo' on the best course
for the government to take on the
railroad situation. Ills capacity for
hindsight, as we learn from his
speeches, is highly developed, but as
to his foresight, we are not equally
veil tnfdrmed.
"Mr, Wilson has bow had about
four years of experience, and he has
earned faith and fsrust. I do not
think It a logical or sensible thing to
change to an Inexperienced and un
tried man, just tor tho sake of
chftngo, or without much better rea
sons being given for tho change than
I linvo noticed.
N"Roosevelt was my choice. He has
had experience and Is one of the besi
of Americans, but tho machine-controlled
Republican party would not
hnvo him. Therefore I am for
Woodrow Wilson."'

Washington, Sept. 9. Orders
were Issued by the War Department
for titc discharge from Federal ser
vice as soon as practicable of twelve
national guard regiments, compris
ing about 15,000 men, recently with
drawn to their home States from the
.Mexican border, and a number of

which will go as soon as Its mem
bers are freed from danger of para

cases of the disease already havo
been reported In that regiment and
it will be held In camp as a matter
of precaution until the infection has
been eradicated. Surgeon-General
Oor.f .lid a vigorous campaign
against the disease was being waged
and that he expected to see It stamp
ed out promptly. A special paraty-
phoid serum Is being manufactured.
and special precautions are taken to
prevent the Infection from spread
ing. There are about 40,000 guards
men still in State mobilization
camps, and these probably will be
dispatched to the border very soon
to relieve men now serving there.
Secretary Baker favors giving all
the State troops a chance for the
training to be acquired on the pa
trol line.
The orders were construed by
some officials as a preliminary movo
to the withdrawal of Gen. Pershlns'.s
regulars from Mexico. Officers of
tho General Staff Insisted, however,
that the release of the guardsmen
resulted principally from the Im
proving conditions on the border."1

IX CARRYING OK MAINE
Portland, Me., Sept. 11. Main
Republicans, re-enforced by return
ing Progressives, won a signal vic
tory at the election to-day. They
elected a Governor, an Auditor, two
United States Senators and four
Representatives in Congress and
wresting control of the State House
of Representatives from the Demo
crats, will be able on a joint vote of
the Legislature ." elect the other
State officers not chosen by popular
vote.
Carl E. Mllllken led his ticket, de
feating Gov. Oakley C. Curtis, who
sought re-election, by a plurality of
approximately 12,000.
The Republican drift extended to
county officers, the greater number
of countlps choosing Republican
County Attorneys and Sherllfs.
These officers are important locally
because the holders are charged with
enforcing the piohibltlon law.
The vote was very heavy, as had
been expected, for the campaign had
been waged with a determination
not scon lu recent years.

IX MIT AGAINST PAPER
Chicago, Sept. 9. Suit for $1,
000.000 was filed by Henry Ford,
the Detroit manufacturer, against
tho Chicago Tribune in the United
State District Court here. Mr.
Ford asks personal damages as com
pensation for an editorial printed
In the Tribune June 23, which, it is
charged, called Ford an "anarchist."
The editorial was printed moro
than two mouths ago. According to
the announcement which came from
Mr. Lurklng's office the word "an
archist" was used In the headline of
tho editorial. The editorial Itself
censured Mr. Ford's ideas and meth
ods. It was learned that Ford Ii:ih
had the suit under contemplation
for several weeks.
The bill charges that the Tribune
"sought to bring the plaintiff Into
public hatred, contempt, ridicule and
financial Injury" by publishing tho
editorial. The editorial, it Is charg
ed, referred to Mr. Ford as "Igno
rant," a "deluded human bein?,"
and ..an anarchistic eneinv to tho

WHEAT PRICES TOUCH
HIGH LEVEL FOR WEEK
Chicago, Sept. 10. Wheat prices
touched a new high level for the sea
son last week, various elements com-
ev-UUieat sold as high as $1.G2 per
bushel. Thero was quite a rush to
buy cash wheat during tfio wVekj
ad-land the would-be buyers found tho
grain scarce. In fact it was so
scarce that those who hold Uie grain
can almost name their own prices
it, as it is now more of a ques-
tlon of being able to obtain milling
wheat than of price.
Experts estimate that the wheat
crop was the shortest sinco 1904 and
is 25,000,000 bushels under re
quirements. Figuring on last year'n
carry-over the United States and
Canada combined ican .evport only
275,000.000 bushels this year.
