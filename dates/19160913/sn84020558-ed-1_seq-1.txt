DUFFY II KIBBEY HATED
At 3 o'clock this morning, after a slow count, in spite of the great
number of voting, precincts into which the state has been divided and
the surprisingly light vote, there wt re no definite figures from any county
as to the result of the primary election yesterday. But it is certain that
G. W. P. Hunt has been re-nominated for governor over George A. Olney
by an estimated majority of 5,000. CHnev has carried this county by
something less than 1,000 votes and he has prohably carried no other
county except Graham. Hunt succeeded in holding the labor vote which it
had been claimed had been divided.
It is almost certain that Wiley Jones has been re-nominated for at
torney general and Justice H. D. Ross of the supreme court, has a long
lead for re-nomination over Judge Frank Duffy of Santa Cruz. Other
candidates who are doubtless nominated are A. A. Betts for the corpora
tion commission, C. O. Cs, s jperinter.dent of public instruction, G. H.
Bolin. mine superintendent and Chirles R. Howe, for the tax commission.
The nomination of Jesse Bovce for auditor and D. F. Johnson for state
treasurer were not contested.
Representative Carl Haydcn has been re-nominated bv an overwhelming
majority over A. A. Worsley, who appears to have carried ? single county,
Pima. The re-nomination of Henry F. Ashurst for the United States
senate was not contested. No figures ?re available as to the contost
among the candidates for presidential electors.
There were only two contests on the republican state ticket. Jud'ie
Joseph Kibbey has been nominated hy wide margin over Judge W. H.
Stilwell. Henry L. Eads appears to havs been nominated for representa
tive! in congress.
Early returns from tho democratic
jn'iniiiry left no doubt of the renomi
lutuou of Coventor Hunt. Though that
had been tho opinion of observers for
weeks, the light vote in th is county
made it evident that the claims of the
lney people of a majority of from
ir.nn to 250" in Maricopa would not he
sustained. The early count showed
majorities for him in nearly all pre
e.lncts Put they were smaller than had
been epected and could not bo ex
pected to over emie the majorities that
had been conceded to Hunt in the large
mining centers by the more conserva
tive eif the iilney managers. These ma
jorities it was indicated would he m-i-reased
far beyoipl the cemcessions. so
that at an early hour this morning, the
meaner figures that had been received
left douht onlv regarding the size of
Hunt's majority.
In this county in tbe most eif the
precincts, tlie count whin wa i slow
included only the state ticket of Cue
ilemo; ratie ballot and until a late hour,
only unofi'i i.tl futures of the guberna
torial content were obtainable. Such
scattering figures as had been received
at niiunight inuicaied the nomination i
of Wiley Jones for Attorney General, f

OFFEHE IS
RESUMED NQHTH
OF TOE S011E
Resuming their offensive north of
the Somme in France, French forces
again have smashed the German tines,
captured other trenches and taken
about 1500 prisoners.
The new attacks were made on the
front from Combles to the river. So
vicious was the thrust of the French
that it required only half an hour for
them to overcome the resistence of the
Germans and make themselves mas
ters of three and three-quarter miles of
first line trenches.
East and southeast of Combles they
seized additional trenches along the
Bethune-Peronne road, which leads
from Peronne northward through
Bapaume and Arras to Bethune, plac
ing an impediment in the way of the
Germans for ths movement of their
transport from the north to Peronne.
On the British end of the front only
mutual bombardments took place. All
along the Macedonian front the heavy
oflensivc of the entente continues. Bul
garian trenches on a front of two miles
and to a depth of 800 yards are reported
by Paris to have been captured by the
French west of the Vardar river near
Majadgh, which lies about four miles
south of Gievgeldi. On the Struma
front the British, aided by the French,
have made adaitional gains east the
river in the Lake Takinos region. The
army of the Teutonic allies is declared
to have suffered hesvy casualties in
the latter engagement.
Unofficial reports are that the Bul
garians have evacuated the forts at
Kavala on tne Aegeanza, which they
capture in August. While the pres
ence st er tui.te warships off the town
in n-.-rn -,s the reason for th with
draw.,;, ,r is not improbable that the
menace, cl tile new drive of the British
an t Krenct along the Struma front
may h . c been partly responsible
for it.
Berlin reports further progress for
the German and Bulgarian forces un
der Field Marshal von Mackenson in
tho Dobrudjj region of Eastern Ru
mania. Attacks by the Russians in east
Galicia and on the lower Stokhod river
in Russia, have been repulsed by the
Austro-German forces, according to
Berlin and Vienna. Pctrograd reports
that in the Carpathians tho Russians
have captured several additional
strategetic positions but Vienna de
clares that all attacks there were re
priced. French Start Offensive
PARIS, Sept. 13. The French in
fantry started a vigorous offensive to
day along a front of nix kilometers
north of the Somme, from the 'lim
bics regiem to the river, and in rut If an
hour took an entire first line of Gor
man trene-bes, says tbe official ceim
rniinication issued tonight. Another
portion eif French forces carried a
system of trenche-s along the reiad from
ifethnne to I'eronne. Prisoners to tho
number of l.r.oo had been taken when
the report was filed.
Klscwhere on the front there was
only artillery activity.

PLATTSBURG, N. Y., Sept. 12
Charles K. Hughes, in the last speech
of his first presidential campaign trip,
asserted here tonight before a crowd
that filled the opera house, that the re
sult in Maine had proved the republi
can party was reunited. He declared
the party would nt)t "change its plans
eir aims." Persons in the audience took
the reference to apply to criticisms of
the methods pursued in conducting tho
present campaign and applauded tho
nominee vigorously.
"I come to you," Mr. Hughes said,
"as the spokesman of a reunited repub
lican party. We have said it was re
united; we have devoutly hoped it
would be re-united. Now Maine proves
that it is re-united. Whoever was
skeptical about that before must hide
his cynicism now. We shall abandon
no efforts. We shall not change our
plans or aims, but we shall go forwarel
with renewed confidence because the
old state in the northeast corner has
spoken in no uncertain way."
He: assailed the Wilson administra
tion for failure to reduce the cost eif
living, for extravagance, for failure to
protect American lives and rights
abroad, and for failure to "live up to its
promise to observe the merit system."
1 tie nominee emphasized previous dec
larations that the campaign was "a
geeeiei natured one."
"It is a time for assessment, for ap
praisal and for candid statement," he
said. "No one in this ceiuntry can ob
ject to full and fair discussion. That
is the very spirit of our institutions.
"I do not desire, in speaking of those
who do not agree with me, to make the
slightest respect. If the argument is
sound, it will carry without any sug
gestion of personal enmity. We do not
need that in our campaigns. What we
need is fairness and truth, and then let
the electorate decide.
"Our friends on the other side said
that the republican party was responsi
ble for the high cost of living. They
have been in power for some time antl
I do not see that the high cost of living
has been redue-ed. It was said they
would dispose eif many useless offices.
The abolition of useless offices has not
been quite so apparent as the appoint
ment of useless officers."
Earlier in the day the nominee vis
ited the military training camp here,
remaining for dinner with Major Gen
eral Leonard Wood. Tonight Mr.
Hughes praised the camp in his speech.
"It is a training school in democ
racy," he said. "It is a discipline that
knits men together in wholesome com
radeship. It is a preparednet-s. not
only military, but civil and moral.
"That is the spirit we must have in
this country if America is to go for
ward, if America intends to hold her
place,among the nations in the trouble
some days of the twentieth century.
"I desire to see these camps main
tained in various parts of our land
and men in constantly increasing num
bers seeking the benefit of the train
ing and discipline. I believe that our
citizen reserve should be trained un
der federal authority."
Mr. Hughes left Plattsbtirg for New
torK tonight. He will remain there
until tomorrow afternoon, when he w ill
go to his summer home al Eridge
hampton, L. I., there to remain until
September 17 or 18, when he starts hia
