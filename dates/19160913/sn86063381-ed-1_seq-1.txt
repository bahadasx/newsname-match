BY COUNTY BOARD
Commission Appointed and Matter to
Be Taken Up With State
Commission.
CITY COUNCIL HAS
APPOINTED COMMITTEE
Meeting to Be Held Monday at Which
Time It is Believed Board
Will Act.
Bemidji merchants at a meeting
of the Bemidji Merchants' associa
tion Tuesday decided to enter a pro
test against the increase's of valua
tions made by the county board of
equalization. The merchants are of
the opinion that the increases were
unjust inasmuch as full valuation
was reported in the majority of the
cases.
Committee Named.
H. E. Reynolds, C. E. Battles and
W. N. Bowser were appointed a com
mittee to act with Mayor Charles W.
Vandersluis, Alderman J. P. Lahr,
Assessor T. E. Lloyd and City Attor
ney P. J. Russell, appointed at a re
cent meeting of the council to inves
tigate the matter.
The committees will meet with the
state tax commission to discuss the
matter next Monday.
The following letter was sent to the
tax commission by Mayor Vanders
luis and Alderman J. P. Lahr. The
letter points out the increases which
are questioned and is self-explana
tory:
Letter Fellows.
Minnesota State 'tax Commission,
St. Paul, Minnesota.
GentlemenAs chairman and as
clerk of the city of Bemidji board of
equalization, we respectfully call your
attention to the following existing
conditions in our city and the changes
in the assessment by the Bel
trami county board of equalization.
Our assessor, T. E. Lloyd, made the
automobile assessment in compliance
with the instructions received from a
member of your honorable board. The
list price was used as a basis and a 25
per cent reduction made for each
year's use, thus arriving at the as
sessed actual value. A car purchased
in 1916 would be assessed at list
price. Why should the county board
make a raise of 25 per cent on this
item? The owner of a car purchased
this spring will then pay on a greater
valuation than the list price.
Iniustice to Merchants.
The assessor obtained the in
voices of at least one-third of our
merchants when making the assess
ment and computed the assessed ac
tual value from these figures. The
county board saw fit to raise all
stocks of merchandise 25 per cent
above the assessor's figures. Will this
not be an injustice to these mer
chants"
In order to keep down our rate of
taxation our assessor has placed a
valuation on our platted property and
structures even beyond the real value
as can be corroborated by the fact
that several of our property owners
are not paying the 1914 and 1915
property tax, and have appealed to
the district court for relief. The
valuation of 1916 is identical with
that of 1911. Lots assessed at $2,-
000 can be purchased for $1,000.00.
Lots assessed at $800 have actually
been purchased for $400.00.
To Submit Evidence.
In addition to this inflated value,
the county board has now increased
the valuation of our platted prop
erty and structures by 15 per cent.
Was this done to equalize the valua
tion of our platted property with that
of the village of Solway?
We are willing and anxious to sub
mit such videnee as you may desire
to substantiate the statements made
herein.
We respectfully request advice
from your honorable board, regard
ing relief from the increases inflicted
by our county board. Respectfully
yours,
C. W. VANDERSLUIS,
Chairman, County Board of Equali
zation, Mayor of Bemidji.
J. P. LAHR, Clerk,
City Board of Equalization.

sewing room be divided into two class
rooms. The sewing room will be
moved to the mechanical drawing
