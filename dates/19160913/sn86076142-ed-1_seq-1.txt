"I come to you," Mr. Hughes said,

hoped It was re-united. Now Maine
proves that It is re-united. Whoever

SUBMARINE POLICY
( By Aaaoclated Preaa.)
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 13.
The Mexican members of the inter

the American conferees that the re
cent ukase by Carranza fixing the
taxation of mining property in Mexico
was noUUntended to be confiscatory
Ua any aonae. The real purpose, they
aid, was: to raise internal revenue
and foster development of Mexican
industries.
The Mexicans stated further the
scheme was designed to cause the
operation of properties lying domant
and also make the burden of taxa
tion tall heavier on the larger operators.
The commissioners devoted their
attention to a study of the effect on
American owned properties of the
present taxation decrees. The Mexi
cans pointed out that in no case
where an American owned property
had it been confiscated.

its promise to observe the merit

The nominee emphasized his pre
vious declaration that the campaign
was a "good natured" one.
'It Is a time for assessment for ap

he said. "No one in this country can
object to full and fair discussion.
That is the very spirit of our Insti

"I do not desire In speaking of
those who do not agree with me, to
manifest the slightest disrespect. If
the argument 1b sound, it will carry

TO THE PRESIDENT
WASHINGTON, Sept. 13. Dr. Har

more than any other to Insure pure
food and drugs in this country, has
publicly announced that he will not
support President Wilson because Mr.
Wilson has failed to enforce the pure
food and drugs act. Dr. Wiley says:
I favor the election of Mr. Hughes,
not because of Mr. Wilson's Mexican
policy, or his foreign policy and for
any of the usual reasons, but because
he has' shown absolute Indifference to

failure to enforce the pure food law.
Benzoate of soda Is still regnant, the
fumes of burning sulphur march on
undisturbed and Coca Cola, declared
by the supreme court to be mis-

department, while not even a pre
