All attendance records at the Big
Free fair were broken today. By 3
o'clock this afternoon it was estimated
that 37,000 were on the fair grounds
and every street car followed by two
trailers running on a 2-minute sched
ule was filled to overflowing. By 1:30
the grandstand was nearly filled with
race track tans.
By 10 o'clock this morning crowds
were jamming the walks in the
grounds, the Johnny J. Jones shows
were running, the eating booths were
doing a big business and the barkers
were enjoying a profitable trade. Ex
hibit halls were filled with farmers
and townspeople and judges had dif
ficulty in pushing their way thru the
crowds.
Country Jitneys to Fair.
Specials on the Rock Island, Union
Pacific and Santa Fe railroads were
filled and many passengers were oblig
ed to stand. It is estimated that there
are 20,000 Kansas visitors in Topeka
today.
"With the record breaking crowds
of Tuesday and Wednesday everything
promises that this will be one of the
host state fairs Kansas ever had," said
Phil Eastman, secretary today.
AutOH Crowd Hoot Its.
Jitney drivers at Herington and
other towns near Topeka took advan
tage of the jammed condition of the
special trains and hauled passengers
Into Topeka for the same fare as the
railroads. Jitneys and taxicabs filled
the driveways in the fair grounds and
caused the owners of eating booths
near the main gate to register com
plaints at headquarters. Every effort
will be made in the future to keep
the jitneurs out of the way of possible
customers.
Hundreds of farmers and their
families gathered in front of the
grandstand at the main gate this noon,
unpacked tempting lunches and en
joyed a Mate fair cabaret staged by
Marshall's band.
Hundreds at Traitor Show.
More hundreds stood around the
dozens of machinery and tractor ex
hibits. The chug, chug of tractor en
gines could be heard from all parts
of the grounds. Windmills erected bv
exhibitors caught the breezes and
spun merrily in the air. Tomorrow
morning a tractor demonstration will
be given on the McAfee farm, just west
of Gage park.
A crew of fifteen men working
rapidly on the construction of a quar
ter of a mile of cement roadway near
the main gate attracted attention all
during the day. The exhibit of four
teen local automobile dealers in Motor
hall was one of the most popular on
the grounds.
Judging hi lH'partments.
Marshall's and the Knights of
Pythias bands played from early
morning until night at the fair
grounds, the concession men were
atood in the streets and took picture,
HUNDREDS OF MOTOR CARS
They Form Endless Stream on
Roads Into Topeka.
Out-of-Town Attendance Will
Go Higher Tomorrow.
Thousands of visitors, by far the
largest out-of-town attendance so far
this week, surged into Topeka today
to attend the free fair here. Special
trains were packed. Two specials on
the Rock Island, one from Horton and
another from Belleville and Hering
ton, consolidated in McFarland, un
loaded 1,616 persons here this morn
ing A special on the Union Pacific
from Marysville carried more than
half as many as did the two Rock
Island trains. Santa Fe, Rock Island,
Missouri Pacific and Union Pacific
passenger officials report that every
inbound train today was loaded to full
capacity. The majority of regular
trains carried extra coaches and
.equipment.
And the railroads, by far. did not
carry all the visitors. Hundreds of
motor cars from towns to the north,
east, south and west poured into the
city by the hundreds and formed an
endless stream of vehicles on the
highways. Gus Beauchamp, presiding
judge at the fair, was one of those
coming in from Holton today. He re
ported railroad facilities not adequate
to carry the crowds at each station,
and the roads were lined with motor
cars, he said.
Officials of the fair and business
men today said an estimate of at least
20,000 visitors would be conservative.
Tomorrow out-of-town attendance is
expected to go higher. Recent rains
have put the roads in excellent shape
for motorists, they report. More
special trains will be run.
Tomorrow the Santa Fe will run a
special train from Halifax and inter
mediate points to Topeka and return.
The special will leave Halifax at 7:30
in the morning and arrive in Topeka
at 9:45 o'clock. In the evening it will
leave Topeka on the return trip. at
10:45 o'clock making stops at all in
termediate points.
Tomorrow morning a Rock Island
special will, leave. .JiorUm. utt' itihn'k
and arrive in Topeka at' 9 o cloctc,
leaving, on the return trip at 10:45
o'clock in the evening. Specials will
be run o-er the same road from Belle
ville and Herington, leaving Belleville
at 4:45 o'clock in the morning and
Herington at 6:45 o'clock. They will
leave Topeka on the return trip at
7:30 in the evening.
The Union Pacific will run a spe
cial tomorrow from Blue Rapids to
Topeka by way of Garrison Crossing,
leaving Blue Rapids at 6:30 o'clock in
the morning and leaving Topeka on
the return trip at 10:45 o'clock in
the evening.
Other special trains, the schedules
of which were printed in Monday's
issue of the State Journal, will be run
during the remainder of the week.

Judging of Percheron horses by
Dean W. L. Carlyle of the Oklahoma
Agricultural college, has been finished.
A. P. Loomis of Diamond Springs, has
the champion Percheron mare at the
fair while Wood Bros., of Lincoln,
have the champion Percheron stallion.
Don Riley of St. Joseph, shipped his
champion roadster, Dan Hur, here by
express today. This will add interest
to the horse show tonight as Mr. Riley
has won numerous prizes with his
roadster.
Honors to Miss Ixmg.
Miss Loula Long again walked away
with the lion's share of ribbons at the
horse show Monday night at the Big
Free Fair. Miss Long won first with
Maurine Fisher, in the combination
five-gal ted class; first with four bays
in the four-in-hand class; first with
LaFrance in the three-gaited saddle
horse class; first with a bay and two
chestnuta in the unicorn and second
with Mary Pickford in the three-gaited
saddle horse class.
The grandstand was packed with
spectators, who despite the length of
the show, appeared interested and ap
plauded until the finish the horses,
their riders and drivers as they passed
the grandstand. The air was chilly
but this seemed not to retard the
crowd. There was genuine disappoint
ment manifest when Miss Long did not
drive in person.
Next to Miss Long was O. J. Mooers
of Columbia, Mo., who left the ex
hibition field with three seconds.
Wclty, Shetland Champion.
In the Shetland pony class. D. G.
Welty of Nevada, Mo., gobbled up all
the blue ribbons. Added interest was
attached to his exhibit of pairs and
quartets because a youth drove. , A
team of chestnuts with flowing white
tails was the most popular on the
grounds.
Todd Bond, a bay, owned by E. E.
Cowdrey, of Hutchinson, won first in
the "Kansas Roadster" class. Jack
London, owned by G. Earl Hutton, of
Hutchinson, was second. Howard
Valentine, a Lansing youth, took third.
and Hutton with Limestone, won
fourth. The horse driven by the Lan
sing youth won first with the crowd,
partly on account of its beauty and
partly because of the fancy driving of
Valentine.
Maurice Fisher, a bay, from (She
Long stables won first in the five
gaited class. Second went to Mr.
Mooers and third to Lawrence Bar

Rush Germans From Combles
Peronne Front.

fore Rumanian Invasion.
Paris, Sept. 13. Continuing their
great drive on the front of Combles
and Peronne, the French last night
captured the whole of the village of
Bouchavenes midway between Com
bles and Peronne, despite the Ger
mans most desperate resistance, it
was officially announced today. Early
this morning the French pushed furth
er eastward, capturing the Bois Labe
farms near the Peronne-Bapaume-Bethune
highway, by a brilliant bay
onet charge.
The French gains in the great at
tack that began yesterday afternoon
are of the greatest importance. The
positions carried are the last of the
strongly fortified German third line of
defense between Combles and Peronne.
All the positions now held by the Ger
mans back of this line have been built
under the unceasing fire of French ar
tillery and consequently are not nearly
so strong as the old lines.
Peronne Cut Off From Combles.
Paris, Sept. 13. General Foch is
nearer a striking victory over the Ger
mans than at any time since the great
Somme offensive began. Combles. the
main point of support of the whole
German line from Bapaume to Pe
ronne is under fire from two sides and
half way surounded as the result of
yesterday's smashing blow by the
French.
Peronne itself has been cut off from
direct communication with Combles
and the French, driving eastward on a
front of nearly four miles, have estab
lished themselves almost directly
north of the city.
The capture of both Combles and
Peronne within a fortnight is expected
by some military critics if Foch con
tinues his hamme? Tblows north of the
Somme.
The French also took by assault a
wood 600 yards east of the road from
Peronne to Bethune. On the Verdun
front the French made progress in the
northern part of the Vaux-Chapitre
wood.
Cut Off Danube Supplies.
Bucharest, Sept. 13. The Austrians
are retreating from the upper Maros
and Alta Valleys in Transylvania with
out attempting any serious resistance,
it was officially announced today.
The capture of Orsova by the Ru
manians has stopped the progress of
Austrian and Bulgarian supply ships
on the Danube. The new Russo-Ru-manian
offensive in the Dobrudja is
progressing.
Hungarians Indignant Over Failures.
London, Sept. IS. The Morning
Post's Budapest correspondent says
there is intense indignation in Hun
gary over the government's failure to
provide against a Rumanian advance
immediately after the declaration of
war.

HUSBANDJS HELD
Wife Charges Him With White
Slavery "In Topeka.
Says He Followed Her About
Demanding Earnings.
WAIT FOR FEDERAL OFFICERS
Couple Connected With Stand
at the State Fair.
Assault and Battery Charge Is
Also Placed.
The simple little charge of assault
and battery is holding W. H. Jensen
in the county jail for federal officers
who are expected tonight with a more
serious charge. Jensen is a conces
sionaire at the state fair and he was
arrested there today by George Frost,
marshal of the court of Topeka.
The warrant for Jensen was issued
upon complaint of his wife who al
leged that when she asked him for
money enough to buy her breakfast
this morning he struck her. She told
that story to the county attorney.
But before she visited the county at
torney she was at the-federal building
and told the officers there a much
more thrilling story. She declared her
husband had trailed her about from
state to state for immoral purposes
and compelled her to turn her earn
ings over to him.
Then she told of the incident today
when she asked for enough money to
buy her breakfast. The federal offi
cers desired to. hold Jensen until the
proper federal officer arrived, so they
went with her to the court house to
make the assault and battery com
plaint. Jensen was not in hU "Root Beer
stand when the officers visited his
place this morning. A substitute paid
he had gone to get his breakfast. A
big man wearing a cap wandered back
near the stand later picking his teeth.
The substitute left the stand and
whimpered something to him. The
man started to walk away, but George
frost dropped into step on one side
and Judge Hugh Fisher on the other.
He admitted his name is Jensen. He
read the warrant over without a word,
stepped into the automobile and was
driven back to the county jaiL
The woman disappeared after
swearing to the complaint and the of
ficers are looking for her.
ICE WATER ON"
WIFE'S TOE NOT
DIVORCE CAUSE
New Tork. Sept. 13. Ice water
dropped by a husband on his wife's
big toe is not enough to dissolve a
marriage, according to Vice Chancel
lor Lewis, of Jersey City.
Mrs. Julia Steffens, of Jersey City,
could show the vice chancellor no
reason for divorce stronger than the
ice water which she says was poured
on, her while she slept. The decree
was refused to her and granted to her
husband, "William Steffen, of Hoboken,
in a counter suit. He explained it was
just a teaspoonful of water, anyway,
and he was trying to wake her so she
would go to church with him.
Good Roads Meeting Brings Up
State Problems.
KANSAS IS 'WAY BEHIND
Too Much Talk and Sot Enough
Work Cause.
Prominent Boosters From All
Districts Here.
Kansas must enact new laws, must
amend her constitution nd must con
duct a systematic state-wide campaign
under direction of experts if she ex
pects a favorable showing as a good
roads state. That was the advice to
road boosters today by Governor Cap
per in an address at the good roads
meeting in Representative hall.
The governor flatly told the road
enthusiasts that Kansas is far behind
the procession in its campaign for
good highways. He quoted facts and
figures and told the sixty men and
women in the meeting that the state
must quit talking and go to work II
it expects a thoro system ol permanent
roads. J. Frank Smith, of Pleasanton;
W. S. Gearhart, state engineer; J. T.
Botkin. secretary of state, and other
prominent Kansans laid down plans
for the building of good highways.
Plans for the work before the state
legislature were discussed and a defi
nite program is to be presented to the
legislature.
Prominent road boosters from many
Kansas counties are attending the ses
sion in the state house. Every sec
tion of the state is represented. From
among the leaders in today's meeting,
a committee will be selected to lay the
road program before the Kansas law
makers. .
Governor Capper opened the meet
ing which he had called by proclama
tion. He was also the principal
speaker at the session. W. F. Hughes,
a Plainville banker and legislative
candidate from Rooks county, was
elected chairman and presided at the
meeting. W. P. Montgomery, of To
peka, special assistant attorney gen
eral, was secretary.
i-'. : . .Capper's Speerh. : . :
Discussing Kansas roads. Governor
Capper said in part:
"However loyal we may be I believe
we will admit, we should admit, that
Kansas is far behind many other states
in its road building. I refer to this
depressing fact because I believe we
ought to look straight at the truth.
Arkansas, which some persons refer
to as the heme of the razorback hog,
log cabins and stills, nevertheless has
nearly or quite three times as much
improved highway as Kansas. Gov
ernment reports use this word' 'im
proved' only in referring to hard sur
faced roads. Of these Kansas had. in
June, 1916, 160 miles of gravel, 240
miles of macadam, 4 or 5 miles of
concrete, and 4 - or 5 miles of brick
road, a total of 410 miles about four
tenths of 1 per cent of our total road
mileage. Fourteen Hates spend more
money than Kansas for roads, but 41
have more miles of surfaced roads.
Kansas stands 15th among .the states
of the Unicn in expenditure for high
way improvements, and 42nd in the
amount of roads surfaced. Only six

IN WARJOUNCIL
Kaiser and Central Powers'
Leaders Plan Defensive.
Elated Over Fall of Silistra,
Key to Bucharest.
Berlin, Sept. 13. The combined
"grand offensive" of the allies will be
met by a combined "grand defensive"
of the central powers,, who will swing
to the attack when the proper time
comes.
The great war council beinf held
at the kaiser's headquarters on the
eastern front is for unifying the direc
tion of all military movements by
armies of the central powers. Since
early in the war the central powers
have acted completely in accord with
their military movements, making it
possible to beat off vastly superior
enemy forces.
That scheme of unified defense and
offense will be even more effective as
the result of the present conference
attended by war chiefs of the four em
pires warring on the allies.
Most favorable reports were brought
to the war council from the different
fronts. The Austro-German com
manders sent word that the latest
Russian offensive around Halitz has
been stopped. It was learned that the
German and Bulgarian invasion of
Rumania continues to make progress
while the Bulgarians are successfully
resisting British and Serbian attacks
in Greece. The capture of the Ruman
ian fortress of Silistra is regarded as
of special importance by the German
and Bulgarian commanders. The po
sition is considered the key to
Bucharest. .
KaisT Suspicious of Bulgaria.
London, Sept. 13. The greatest im
portance is attached to the present
conference at the kaiser's headquar
ters on the eastern' front. Besides the
kaifer. Chancellor von Bethmann
Hollweg. King Ferdinand and Crown
Prince Boris, of Bulgaria, and Enver
Pasha, Turkish war minister, several
leading diplomats of the central pow
ers are represented in consultation.
Rome heard from Swiss sources to
day that the kaiser called the confer
ence because he was disturbed by
hints that Bulgaria was threatening
i to sue for a separate peace.
City Officials Devise Ways to
Settle, in Tain.
TO APPEAL TO
Mayor Would Pass Law Com
pelling Arbitration.
Motor Bus Franchise to Be
lieve Congestion.
Xew York,' Sept. 13. Interest In the
street railway strike today centered in
the meeting of the public service com-. '
mission at which traction officials and
leaders of the strikers will make their
formal rephes to the recommendation
of the commission made yesti rday for
an immediate suspension of the strike
and settlement of the questions at Is
sue by arbitration.
Leaders of bcth sides have an
nounced officially their intention to re
ject the recommendation. But few
surface cars were operated today and
passengers were forced to use the
subways and elevated roads.
Altho traction officials claim mora
trains than normal are in operation,
congestion at express stations was ex
treme. Platforms were crowded and
many narrow escapes were experi
enced by passengers. .
There was little or no violence dur
ing the night, largely due to the fact
that policemen were stationed on roof
tops where attacks bad been made on
elevated trains.
Big Strike Parade Tomorrow.
Hugh Frayne, state organizer of the
American Federation of Labor an
nounced today that between 12,000
and 20,000 men will take part In the
parade and demonstration tomorrow.
Altho ho declined to discuss the pro
posed "sympathetic" strike other un
ion leaders said plar.s had been made
to call out trades closely allied to the
street car men In the event the dem
onstration tomorrow and the efforts
of the public service commission prove
Unavailing to settle tbe trouble." '
Mayor IMtchell, it developed today.
has under consideration two methods
of settling the strike. One Is to re
quest Governor Whitman to call a
special session of the legislature to
pass a law compelling both sides to
accept arbitration while the other
proposes the immediate granting of a
franchise to the New York Motor Bus
company, incorporated to run ma
chines thru certain streets. This fran
chise has been before the board of
estimate for the past year.
Probing Dynamite Plot.
Brooklyn detectives, it was disclosed
today, are investigating a reported
