DP
artment of Justice Takes
Hand to Aid in Nation-Wide
Investigation.
A national probe into the cost
of producing milk and the justifica
tion for the threatened rise in
prices, 'was announced today by the
Agricultural Department.
The first formal action will be
taken tomorrow when milk pro
ducers from Maryland land Vir
ginia who supply the Washington
market will confer with depart
ment officials..
W. J. Spillman, of the office of
farm management; B. H. Rawl,
chief of the dairy division, and De
partment Solicitor Frank G. Caffy
will be in charge of the Govern-
ment effort. Spillman today said
hfi would appoint a special investi-
', gator, an expert of national reputa
tion, to study conditions throughout
the.jUntted States to learn whether
producers would be justified in a
general price raise.
Solicitor Caffy was prdered Into the
cue at the suggestion of Administra
tion leaders when middlemen and dis
tributer!, who are charged with hold
ing the whip hand' over the farmery,
threatened anti-trust law action If the
nation a milk producers sought to com
bine. Virtually, the probe will be under
taken as an answer to the following
proposition received from milk pro
.U;?'"S all ovor tna country and espe
cially from New York. Now England.
Pennsylvania, and the region about
Chicago:
"We don't know Just what It Is cost
ing us to produce milk, but we do know
we are getting poorer, so we want to
know whether wo are getting enough
money for our product."
Letters Pouring In.
This Is the tenor of letters that have
been pouring Into tho department for
months. The lettere aro chiefly from
milk producers In territory contiguous
to cities of 26.000 and up.
Chief Spillman believes there aro
two boalo causes. One Is a shortage
. J. and. therefore, higher prices for.
feed. The other is too much regula
tion by city health authorities.
Health authorities naturally are
trying; to make ideal conditions. The
object getting pure milk of course
Is commendable, but they leave little
Initiative to the farmer. They study
we..fa.rm ,ia,ld J.ho.L former's system.
If that's all right, they rate him high,
sometimes even when the milk Itself
jinn nui uoen turrecuy tested. What
they ought to do Is to go after the
milk, keep close tab on It, and as long
as It rates as It should let the far
mer alone. In many Instances the
r farmer has been ordered to Install so
many modern Improvements that he
actually loses when he sells at the
present prices.
"The biggest question far the spe
cial Investigators whom I shall ap
point shortly will be that of the cost
of the product In relation to the cost
of complying with health department
regulations, and the relation of the
regulation recommended to the purity
of the milk."

Maryland Plans to
Regulate the Use of
Blinding A uto Lamps
Government and State Automobile Club, Aroused by
Increase of Accidents on Baltimore Boulevard,
Seek to Make Highways Safe.
By S. M. REYNOLDS.
BALTIMORE, Sept. 13. Thoroughly aroused over
growing number of automobile accidents occurring on
Washington-Baltimore boulevard, officials of the Maryland
State government and of the Automobile Club of Maryland are
considering ways and means of
ing along that popular highway, particularly at night.
Of particular concern to officials in this State is the neces
sity for some practical means of
try roads of the glaring headlights. Although motoriBts be
tween tho two cities are not
in Baltimore or Washington, there is no law existing to pro
hibit their use outside the limits of these cities.
Owing to the absolute necessity for such lights on dark
stretches of road throughout the
cials here is that an absolute
cause more accidents than otherwise, and.that the only remedy
would appear to be along the 'line of some regulations govern
ing their use.
POLICE SEEK
In the meantime, the police of BaM
iimore are energetically endeavoring
to locate the owner of the mysterious
automobile which collided last Bun
day night near Beltsvllle. Md., on the
Washington-Baltimore boulevard with
the machine driven by Capt. A. J.
Taylor, of Washington. In this acci
dent Captain Taylor and his wife
were badly shaken up and bruised,
and his two guests, Miss Nellie Shoe
maker and Miss Anna Burke, also of
Washington, were severely Injured.
, According to Captain Taylor, the
acldent was due to the fact that, as
the unknown machine approached
him suddenly around a curve, it
Hashed in hls.face headlights so pow
erful as to blind him for the moment,
causing him to lose control of his car.
Marshal Carter, of the Baltimore po
lice department, said today that, al-

Sunday night Capt. A. J. Taylor, of
this city, driving around a curve in
the road near Beltsvllle, became so
blinded by the glare or headlights on
an approaching machine that he lost
control of his car, and the two col
lided, seriously Injuring Miss Nellie
Shoemaker and Miss Anna Burke, of
this city, two of his guests.
Mr. Cannon said today that a ma
chine ahead of him had Just passed
a delivery auto and that he started
to pass the delivery car also. An
other car was coming toward him.
Mr. Cannon said, and the driver ap
peared confused when he saw the
Cannon car come out from behind
the delivery car.
Mr. Cannon said that the oncoming
car, which, it is said, was being
driven by Frederick II. Schmeslsr, of
Baltimore, swerved suddenly, struck
the front wheel of the Cannon car,
and overturned It.
The Washlnatonlans were brought

In an evening gown. Bhe cuddled th
youngster up in her arms; tho cry
ceased, and what all the Salomon
guests declare was a smile spread over
the baby s face.
That settled It. Mrs. Salomon sent for
a nursing bottle and her limousine. The
baby was wrapped In a blanket, and the

Buzzard's Point Proposed fon'
Location Because of Proxj
imity to Navy Yard. . j
Convincing argument In favor of the'
location of the proposed Government
armor plate factory In or near Wash
ington was made this morning at the
Navy Department, when Secretary Dan
iels and his advisers opened the hear;
Ing'to determlno whore the big Govern
ment manufactory should be located.
The advantages of this territory as
the site for the proposed plant were
explained by a number of speakers, and)
despite the fact that representatives
from about UO cities ware there to
argue in favor of their respective lo
calities, the statements made on behalf
of Washington and vicinity created a
most favorable Impression.
The advantages or locating the plant
wlthto' the District were skilfully ar
gued' by P. T. Moran, president of the
Chamber of Commerce of Washington,
who was accompanied by Joseph I.
Welter and Thomas Grant, secretary of
the Chamber of Commerce.
Virginians Also Plead.
At the same time a largo delegation
of Virginians, headed by Congressman
Carlln, argued for the location- of the
plant ut Alexandria, and one of the
strongest points they made was that
such a pl.int practically would be In
the District, and would be constantly
under the observation of, and In Imme
diate touch with, the higher ofllceri of
the navy, located In Washington. '
In his argument- for the location of
tll pUJ.lu ilr ICni let ifnelf Presi
dent Moron said:
"The same considerations which have
proved to be economically sound In the
creation of a great ordntince manufac
turing plant In the National Capital.
In direct touch with and under Ihe
Immediate control of the administratis o
officers of the Government, point with
conclusive force to a ilmllar policy
with regord to the ormormaklng fac
tory authorired by the naval approprla
tlon act for the current fiscal year."
Buzzard's Point for Site.
The site proposed for the location
of the plant In Washington Is at what
la known as Bustard's Point. This Is
near the Washington Navy Yard. The
ground In question Is the peninsula
bordered on the south and east by the
Eastern Branch and the land used or
to be acquired by the Navy Yard and
on the west by James Creek and the
Washington Arsenal.
All the adjacent land except on the
north Is the property of the United
States, the remaining boundaries be
ing wjde rivers. A twenty-three-foot
channel runs close to the property
and a water front of a mile and a
half Is available for the largest ves
sels which can ascend the Potomac.
Thirty-six city squares are Included
In the property. About half the prop
erty Is owned by the Government and
the other half, about seventy acres,
by private persons. Mr. Weller said
all the land needed to be acquired
could be had from private parties for
$788,950.
One of the arguments made In be
half of Washington was that the de
fense of the Capital must necessarily

victory over the Germans than at any
time since the great Somme offensive
began.
Combles. the main point of stipport
of the whole German line from Ba
paume to Peronne, Is under fire from
two aides and half way surrounded
as the result of yesterday's smashing
blow by the French. Peronne Itself
has been cut off from direct com
munication with Combles, and the
French, driving eastward on a front
of nearly four miles, have established
themselves almost directly north of
the city.
The capture of both Combles and
Peronne within a fortnight Is ex
