Seven construction firms have had

The company has asked that bids be

for the reason that the Santa Ke
agreed to leave the plans with Ard-

HER FORECAST fl,
Hi
during this month. There Is every
reason to believe that the plans will
be changed, and that will necessitate
more work for the draftsman and
more figures for the bidders.
Mr. Kecnan Here.
V. S. Keenan, general passenger
agent of the road, passed through
here today on his way tif Chicago.
He met I. M. Ihjtnam nt the station
and the two men talked over the
plans. Mr. Keenan stated that ex
cept in the large cities the rest rooms
and smoking rooms were being
eliminated from new structures and I
he felt that the plans already agreed
upon by the Santa Ke and Rock Island
would meet every demand of the
traveling public.
Suggested Memorial.
At the meeting held at the city hall
this morning one of the Ardmore
people suggested that a memorial be
built at the station commemorating
the explosion and that the fund lie
started on the 27th day of the month,
on the first anniversary of the ex
plosion. Ardmore Willing to Wait
In case changes are made in the
plans, those plans will have to be
submitted again to the Rock Island,
and it looks like the passenger sta
tion will not be built for several
months to come. Hut the citizens
who met this morning are not worry
ing over the delay. They said very
plainly that if the Santa Ke and Rock
Island do not feel justified in spend
ing more than from JIO.OOo to 00)
now, that if they do not believe this
city deserves a more imposing build
ing, that Ardmore is willing to wait
another year to demonstrate to the
railway companies that the business
at this station deserves a better
