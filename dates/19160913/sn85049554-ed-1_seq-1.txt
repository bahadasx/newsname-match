.lens. Sept 12.—[Delayed]—King
^-/iistantino has accepted the resigna
tion of Premier Zaimis and his cabi
net.

A London dispatch yesterday said M.'
Zaimis had coipplalned that internal
incidents were preventing him from
dealing with the external situation. It
is believed in London that his resigna
tion was due to the fact that he ac
cepted the premiership on the under
standing that he was to maintain neu
trality and In view of the Bulgarian oc
cupation of Greek territory had found
this impossible. Up to the time of tho
first dispatch announcing the resigna
tion his rcxrv^.:t.t wrs unexpected, fpr
it was understood the premier bad as
sumed dictatorial powers and was In
an exceptionally strong position. Po
litical affairs reached a crisis after tho
Bulgarians invaded northeastern Greece
and the followers of former Premier
Venlxelos served warning on the king
that he must abandon the 'advisera
who, it was said, bad misled him. At
the same time M. Venlselos expressed
confidence In M. Zaimis, whom he
asked the king to support, and It was
understood an agreement had been
reached under which Zaimis was to
remain In power. M. Zaimis, altho ad
vocating neutrality, was regarded as
having a predisposition toward the en
tente.)
