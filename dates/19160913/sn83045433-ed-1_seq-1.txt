SAFESAYSJAPAN
IN REPLY TO U. S.
But Japan Admits Truth of
I' Reports That Have Disturb
ed State Department.
Ambassador Guthrie in Tokio yesterday
afternoon cabled the State Department
that he had been officially informed by
the Japanese foreign minister that the
demands made on China ay a result o'
the Mongolia clash in no way endangered
the sovereignty of China nor the Root
Takahira agreement with this government
concerning the "open door" policy.
Nevertheless, Japan, through the
minister, readily admits that in addition
to apologies and monetary compensa
tion. she has "requested" that Japanese
offlicers be "re-appointed" as instructors
in the Chinese cadet school (probably at
Mukden. She also admits that she has
"suggested" that the Chinese government
"should ask" for the "appointment of
Japanese avisers to be stationed with
Chinese garrisons In south Manchuria
and eastern Mongolia, and that as an
extension of its extraterritorial rights
the Japanese government should be per
mitted to station Japanese policemen in
towns where there are large Japanese
settlements."
In this reply, therefore. Japan virtually
admits the truth of the reports which the
United States government had hoped
were not true.
One reason the State Department has
been anxious in 'the matter of the
Japanese demands Is because great
Britian is reported to be working so di
rectly to broaden her already powerful
trade interests in China when the war
is over.
It is said that England in her attempts
to strengthen herself commercially in
China has been fully conversant of the
new demands made by her ally, Japan.
HURT IN HURDLE RACE,
RALPH COffIN MAY DIE
Noted Washington Horseman Fatally
Injured at Bluefield. W. Va.
"Ralph Coffin, riding at the Bluefield
Graham Fair, was mortally injured to
day when his horse, with another, fell in
taking a hurdle In the steeplechase." said
a dispatch from Bluellield, W. Va., last
night.
According to the dIspatch, a field of
ifour were bunched at the first hurdle.
One horse refused and cut across in
front of Coffin's mount. both horses go
ing down. Coffin's shoulder was dislo
cated and he sustained concussion of the
brain and internal injuries.
Coffin is a prominent Washington
horseman whose riding has been a fea
ture of the last four meetings of the
Washington Horse Show. He has estab
lished several records during these meet
ings and during the last two years his
riding in various shows in th, South had
earned him a national reputation.
Cof.in who is about 2 years old and a
bachelor, resides at the Marlborough
apartments with his uncle, former Gov.
Magoon, of the Panama Canal Zone.
His parents live in Pennsylvania. Sev
eral years ago he was adopted by his
uncle. It is probable that his uncle was
with him at the time of the accident, as
inquiries at their home last night elicited
the information that they were both out
of town.
Coffin was popular with the younger
set in and about Washington and is a
member of the Washington Riding and
Hunt Club. under whose colors he fre
quently rode. During the last local
horse show he gained national notice
when he jumped Iis horse, "Rabbit."
over an automobile owned by Thomas
Morgan.
Speaking of the rider last night, Mel
vin C. Hazen. manager of the local horse
show, said:
"Ralph is one of the greatest riders
who ever leaped into a saddle. He was
more than a jockey. He became an ar
tist the minute he got astride a horse. I
havc had him down at my horse farm in
Virginia many times and to his remark
able knowledge of and ability in training
the animals I attribute a good bit of the
success of my stables.
"He was always very daring and reck
less and had been warned many times
against attempting the many difficult
feats he made look easy, but his youth
and naturally adventurous spirit always
dominated his riding.
"If Ralph dies as the result of the In
juries received in this accident, it will
surely bring a feeling of regret and sor
row to all those who knew him Intimate
ly as a man and a horseman."

manner provided in the agreement.

sought to secure acceptance of the in
dividual contracts by fraud. misrepre
