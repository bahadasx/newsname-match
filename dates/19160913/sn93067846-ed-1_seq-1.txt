In addition to the necessary el

During the summer vacation
mainly since the close of the

plant has been thoroughly over!
and repaired and many im]
have been made for the coming

other improvements made there. The
basement of the old building of the )
training school has been arranged for
a rainy day playground for: the pupils
of that school.
The appointment bureau of the col*
lege has helped to place a number of
the Winthrop graduates and others
In teaching positions during the sum*
mer free of all cost to the teach?
ers and to those engaging them.
A committee is preparing plans for
the exercises at the formal openlmr
of the new gymnasium in the early
fall. This Is ihe largest; and best!
equipped gymnasium in the South and
has excited the surprise and admira?
tion of visitors from all parts of the
country.
This gymnasium added much to the
success of the summer school which
closed July 21. This was the best sum?
mer school ever held here, its enroll*
ment of 798 being In excess of any?
thing before known in the State. .
The shaping up of the student body
has been delayed by the new law
governing the award of scholarships.
Under this law the financial ability of
all applicants for scholarships must
be passed on by the State Board of
Charities and Corrections. This board
was unable to meet till September 1.
Under the provision of the law those
pronounced ineligible by the board
could not be awarded soholarshlps no
mutter how high their examination
grades were.
There has been over 1,600 appli?
cants for admission to college this
year and as there is dormitory accom?
modation for only about 975, over
650 had to be refused. Of these 650
many, of course, were not prepared
to enter, but there were enough who
were prepared and who were refus?
ed for lack of room to fill another dor?
mitory.
All students must have dormitory
certificates before coming to Rock
Hill If they expect to room In the col?
lege. These certificates are good only
to the night of September 19 and no
girl can expect to hold her room If
she arrives at a later date.
The college will soon be again in
full swing, the matrons, housekeepers,
etc. will arrive on the 12th, the fac?
ulty and teachers meeting will be
held at noon on September 14. On the
16th will come those students who
bave condition examinations to puss,
who expect to stand examinations for
advanced college standing, or for ad?
mission to tho Latin department.

DECLINES TO M PARTY.
WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION
REMAINS NON-PARTISAN.
Leaders Denounce Efforts to Bind
Membeni to Fight All Who Oppose
Amendmr it.
Atlantic City, N. J., Sept. 8.?The
National American Woman Suffrage
association today reaffirmed its policy
of non-partisanship as an organiza?
tion toward national political parties
and defeated by an overwhelming
vote an attempt to place the associa?
tion on record as in favor of support?
ing national candidates who pledge
their support to the proposed equal
rights amendment to the federal con?
stitution. The resolution, which was
introduced by Mrs. Raymond Robins,
wjfe of the chairman of the last na?
tional convention of the Progressive
party, was branded by some of the
delegates as an anti-Wilson move de?
spite vehement denials by Mrs. Rob?
ins and others who signed the reso?
lution.
The resolution Introduced in the
convention several days ago by Presi?
dent Carrie Chapman Catt that the
immediate and principal aim of the
association was the passage of the
federal amendment and that all State
work was only preparatory thereto
was withdrawn. The subject will bo
Introduced in another form, Mrs. Catt
said, as the resolution, because of the
opposition it has met, apparently has
been misunderstood.
The convention spent much of the
afternoon in deciding on methods of
carrying on its campaign for suffrage.
The question of opposing the reelec?
tion of those members of the house
judiciary committee, whether Demo?
crats or Republicans, who blocked
the suffrage amendment in committee
was left to the judgment of the asso?
ciation's congressional committee.

DANES CANT AGREE ON SALE.
New Efforts to Solve Inlands Ques?
tion Through Coalition Cabinet
Fails.
Copenhagen, Sept. 8 (via London,
Sept. 9).?The new efforts toward
solving the question of the sale of the
Danish West Indies to the United
States by the formation of a coalition
cabinet, failed today.
The collapse of the latest attempts
to reach an agreement was brought
about by the demand of the radical
party that the general elections be
postponed until May, 1918. The Left
and conservative parties were ready to
postpone the elections until the close
of the war but would not agree to
the enactment of a law postponing
the elections until 1918, as they want
elections held as soon as the war is
over.
It now Meems that the question con?
cerning the Bale of the islands can
be solved only by general elections.
DISCUSS BORDER PLANS.
American Commision Confers on
Withdrawal of Troops and Protec?
tion of Border.
New London, Sept. 9.?Considera?
tion of several plans for the joint
protection of the Mexican border and
to preven1: raids, occupied the Amer?
ican commissioners attention. Mem?
bers of the Mexican commission were
absent in New York. The American
commissioners present plan is to con?
sider together the question of the
American troops withdrawal and a
means of protecting the border. The
latter question 13 complicated by
Villa's reported presence In Chihua?

LAURENSTRAGEDY
Laurens, Sept
held today over the boor dt the al*
leged burglar who was killed
night In a battle with Laurens offi?
cers near Fountain Inn. The inquest
took place at the scene of the trag?
edy and the verdict of the jury wad
to the effect that the person was un?
known and came to his,death from
gunshot wounds at the hands of Co?
lumbus L. Owens, rural policeman of
Laurens county.
This afternoon the body was
brought to the city, prepared for
burial and interred in potter's field
beside the grave of the yeggman who
was killed in Laurens seven years age.
The story of the shooting last night
as brought on* at the inquest is sub?
stantially as already reported. The
mas was evidently a Cuban of Span?
ish descent Among his personal ef?
fects were found a money order re?
ceipt for 650 issued at Columbia Sep?
tember 2 and a registered letter re?
ceipt from the same office without
date.
The latter receipt, number 1847,
indicated that the letter was sent by
Pruden Ranurez to Sara Lux De
Ranurez, Matanzas, Cuba, the latter
probably being the wife of the man.
The s'ranger was about 30, dark
complexion, dark curly hair, brown
eyes, five feet five inches and weighed
130. His body bore several old gun
shots and knife wounds. He had a
magazine pistol, a razor and two flash
lights. He was poorly clad, wear?
ing overalls but no socks.
Wednesday morning, away after
the hours of making calls, five resi?
dences in the western part of the city
were entered, the thief making a
specialty of rifling the trouser pock?
ets of the men of the house. He
\vork?d both sides of the street and
made a clean getaway with 875 or
|80. His best prize for the night was
a $51 purse which was extracted from
the trouser pocket of one of the city
policemen who had gone off duty at
1 o'clock. The other hauls ranged
from 82 to 21. The burglar dis?
dained the idea of taking anything
but the cash, for he left a good watch
dangling from a pair of looted trous?
ers which were found hanging in the
back yard the next morning. At Gray
Court the same game was played
Wednesday night, the homes visited
including a minister and several
prominent citizens of the little town.
About $15 was secured.
