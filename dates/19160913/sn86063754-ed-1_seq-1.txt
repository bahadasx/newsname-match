rarmers Win In Fight on Secret
Fertilizer Trade
Washington, Sept. 7.?"Indejendent"
firms in the fertilizer
ndustry, actually operated by
arge concerns, or the so-called
'fertilizer trust," will hereafter
>e fully identified with the par;nt
interests, according to a re
>ort made public today by the
7ederal Trade Commission,
vhich has been investigating
he fertilizer situation. The re
>ort says the companies con:erned
have agreed to show their
'arious relationships on their
containers and letterheads.
The commission's investiga
ion was made in compliance
vith resolutions introduced last
ear by Senator Simmons of
s'orth Carolina to whom faraers
had complained regarding
he high price of fertilizers, $150,100,000
worth of which was conumed
by the American farmers
ti 1914. In a letter to the Sen
te, accompanying the report,
he commission asserts that there
re in the United States 800 conerns
operating some 1,200 plants,
>ut that seven of the large com'
>anies, the largest being the
Virginia-Carolina Chemical
"ompany and the American Agicultural
Chemical Company,
ontrol 58 per cent of the. total
utput. It is asserted that the
rices paid by iarmers for mixed
ertilizers have been high in
omparison with the cash value
f the constituent elements,
artlv because of credit condilocs
and expensive distributing;
aethods of the large companies.
A World of Grunterf
The world today is an aggre
:ation of grunters.
From vouth to old age life is
ust one big grunt after another.
In infancy we grunt from the
:olic, and in maturity we grunt
rom over eating or "bolting"
>ur food, with its consequent in
ligestion, or from the pangs ol
tunger.
If luck comes our way we
;runt because there is not more
uck to double our holdings,
vhile if it passes us by we grunt
it thp ininclir>u r>f
..?>/ iujuuuvv VI 1UIV/I
If our family is in the svv^rn ol
ociety we grunt when we pay
he bills, and if they are not there
ve grunt because they are disTiminanted
against.
If we hold public office we
;runt when our constituents in
ist upon our living up to 0111
iledges, while if we are defeated
it the polls we grunt because
the fools elected that maverick
>ver the way."
If the city dads vote funds for
peal improvements we grunt
tecause it was not in accordance
vith our desires, while if they
leed our advice we grunt beause
they were too stingy.
We grunt at our school teachrs
because they insist upon
bedience to the rules of the
.u~: - - *
uuwui in meir enons 10 install a
ittle knowledge into the heads
>f our offspring, while if they
ail we grunt because they have
lot developed and educational
yonder from a brain that is be
dw par.
We grunt at the preacher
yhen he speaks out the truth,
nd we grunt at him if he don't.
We grunt at the merchant,
nd the doctor, and our beasts of
urden, and even the dog and
tie cat gel a grunt and a kick.
Yes, this world is one great
ggregation of grunters, and a
cvv are even in cur own midst.
But let us hope there are no
runters in paradise,- -Exchange.

into public hatred, contempt,
| ridicule and financial iniurv.' bv

The editorial, it is charged, referred
to Mr. Ford as "ignorant,
a deluded human being" and "an
anarchist enemy to the Nation

wealth."
The editorial alto charged that
employes of Mr. Ford's would
lose their positions if they went
to the border as members of the
National Guard.
Two Ways to Rent
Tom Brown is goin' to move
agin and so also is Brother Ben.
It seems they're never satisfied,
t but always are content to slide
?to move about from place to
place?a sore spot to the human
race. They never work for better
schools, they always farm
with broken tools; they
scratch the land an' make it
pore an' cuss their luck an' rip

talk like sin?an' then they go
?tfi' move agin. They never rent

sort?you never heai him
rare and snort. He's always
, gentle as a lam'?always serene
an' cool an' ca'm. When he
( rents land he does it right?he
says he never lives to fight?
, therefore he makes a contract
strong, one broad an' deep an'
*>ood an' long?one that will
hold as tight as glue an' keep
both parties straight and true.
( This saves him trouble every
day; it shows exactly what's to

Aid The Theachers
i Higher Education our slogan.
I make this statement without
fear of any sane man contradict
ing it. Because if it were not
true why do parents send their
: children to school? I do not
mean when I say higher education,
college education alone,
any education means higher
education. I want to say that
your vacation is now over, but
did you visit any of the Summer
Normal Schools and see how
: hard the teachers were working,
that they might be worth more
to you as a teacher, and more to
the youth of the land as a teacher?

Robert P. Turner,
Orphan Work Day
The custom has grown up of
having one day in the year set
aside as Orphan Work Day.
That means that all friends of
the orphans work on that da*
and whatever they make, they
send to various denominational
orphanages. More and more
the custom has spread until now
it means a great deal to the
orphanages.
This year, Sept. 3C is Orphan
Work Day.
Whatever you make on that
day, if you are a Presbyterian,
it should be sent to Thornwell
Orphanage, Clinton, S. C.. for it
is the Presbyterian Orphanage
offJeortrifl. FInriHil nnA Qm.fli

Carolina. Many children, fatherless
and motherless, are there
from your State, and they are
being train in hand, head and
heart. If it were not for Thorn
well Orphanage they would not
get this training;. If you are a
Baptist send your contribution
to Connie Maxwell Orphanage,
Greenwood. If you are a Methodist
Protestant send your money
to Methodist Protestant Orphanage
at Greensboro, N. C. If you
are a Methodist Episcopal send
it to the Epworth Orphanage,
Columbia, S. C.
Will you not, then, set yourself
to work on the 30th, and get
others to work, and send that
dav's income to your little brothers
and sisters, who must be
cared for, and whom you love
, to help?
Remember the day, Sept. 30th.
Cut this out and read it to the
members of your family.
OH, Rats.
? Randolph paper contains
a business proposition written by
a Randleman barber which indicates
that he has improved his
1 time between shaves and hair
cuts. The scheme follows:
I am contemplating organizing
a company for the purpose of
starting- a cat ranch, the rate tn
be killed for their fur. The
ranch will be located near
Randleman.
To start we will collect 1,000,000
cats. Each cat will average
12 kittens per year. The skins
1 sell from 10 cts., each for the
white ones to 75 cts., for the
pure black. This will give us
12,000,000 skins per year, which
1 at an average of 30 cents, each
will make our revenue about
$10,000 per day gross
A man can skin 50 cats per
dav for $2. It will take about
100 men to operate the ranch
and therefore the net profit will
be about $9,800 per day. We
will feed the cats on rats, and
will start a rat ranch next door.
The rats will multiply four times
as fast as the cats; therefore, if
we start with 1,000,000 rats we
will have 4 rats per day for each
cat, which is a plenty.
Then we will feed the rats on
the carcasses of the cats from
which the skins have been taken,
giving each rat a quarter of a
cat, it will thus be seen that the
ranch will be self-sustaining.
The cats will eat the rats, and
the rats will eat the cats, and we
will get the skins.

Meeting of The Chesterfield
W. M. U.
The annual gathering of the
Chesterfield W. M. U. at Cross
Roads church on September ft?ft
was a great success. The attendance
was good and the interest
manifested was splendid.
We had with us Miss Jessie King
of Columbia and Miss Mary
Adams of Darlington who helped
us very much,
The demonstration given by
the Pageland W. M. L\ on Tuesday
afternoon was fine. This
society is on the honor roll for
this year, having met every requirement
made of it by the
State Union.
It was a pleasure/to hear their
great report; not only have they
done exceedingly well financially
but they have done others
| things among them the report
of 6 mission study classes was
very good.
We feel justified in saying that
we are indeed proud of the Pageland
W. M. S. It is a jov to work
with such noble wide awake
women.
Our union is progressing
wonderfully having made an increase
of nine societies this year
and given more than we were
asked for.
Mrs B. S. Funderburg was reelected
piesident of the Chesterfield
division and Mrs. J. R.
King president of the Pageland
division.
The Supt., wishes to try to express
her sincere appreciation of
the confidence the session has
shown in her by asking her to
serve them again as supt. This
0 ^ 1 1 re"
la a veiy rusponsiDit ouice and
when one thinks of the time
when an account must be given
of how we filled it it is a serious ~ ?
thing but by the help and cooperation
of the noble Baptist
women of our Association we v
aro going to keep right on
hoping yet to reach still higher
planes in our work.
The next annual meeting will
be held with the Pageland
church next September.
Edna V. Funderburk
Essay on the Duck.
Chicago Journal.
A little school girl in Michigan
has written the following essay
on the duck: The duck is a low,
lieavyset bird, lie is a mighty
poor singer, having a coarse
voice, caused by getting so many
frogs in his neck, and he likes
the water and carries a toy balloon
in his stomach to keep
from sinking. The duck lias
only two legs, and they are set
so far back on their running
gears by nature that they come
pretty near missing his body,
some ducks when thev get big
curls on their tails are called
drakes and don't have to set or
hatch, but just loaf and go swim
ming and eat everything in sight
if I were to be a duck 1 would
rather be, a drake they have a
wide wide bill like they use it
ior a spade thep walk like
drunk man side to side il you
scare them they will flap the r
wings and try to make a pass ai
sinking.
Didn't Stop the War
Monroe Journal.
A month or so ago the newspapers
were full of the wonders
of a prophet who claimed that
he could tell all kind of things
in advance anil that he could tell
when wars would begin and
when they would end. September
7 was the time when the \\ ar
in Europe was to end accordi ig
to this nrnnhot Thai %vac * . .c
terday, and so far we have not
heard that the war has ended.
Yet folks will helieve the next
fake that comes along.
