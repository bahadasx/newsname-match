AMONG THE BELGIAN
As we left LaPanne, it
the intention of returning if
for we had met there with two^
pointments. In the first place
not been possible for both of u5
visit the trenches. My husband hi
been taken for a hurried trip through
after much wire pulling, but for the
lady, "it was absolutely forbidden and
clearly not to be thought of, by far
too dangerous-" Arguing the point
made no difference in the vedict, so
we decided to bide our time and take
the case to a higher tribunal, Also we
had desired to see a very beloved boy
of our. Peter by name, whom we had
encountered in London several
months before and with whom we had
carried on a constant and most in
teresting correspondence.
Peter, because his section lay near
to Dixmude, being of a Regiment that
did not go to La Panne, had been un
able with the other to visit us there,
and he was most disappointed, as
were we.
Peter deserves a volume to himself
and I hope later, will have it. After
meeting us in Londan and receiving
from us a Testament he went back to
the trenches, to start among his com
rades a League of Bible readers. But
not alone content to enlist them in
the reading of God's Word, he com
menced to fulfill among them the du
ties of pastor and teacher, spending
long hours of the days, and often the
nights, in leading careless and indif
ferent comrades to a concern for
Heavenly things. He wrote us of
some who had become wonderfully
changed through his ministrations,
and spoke to us of some who had
"passed on" but not before they had
found the peace of heart, for which
they had been seeking. A wonderful
work he has done throughout all the
months this hoy, a son of a Baroness,
his family a noble family, but so
humble and unassuming of spirit, that
he refused even to be a sons-officer,
desiring the rather to remain on the
selves just a month after our first
that he might the better be of service
and help to tliem.
There we met our good friend, M. similar one next year.
Vandervelde, and through his per-1
sonal representations, we found our-
selves, just am onth after our first
remaps it may seem strange io some, K,. V_
lproca'
tion of their own love for us, and
what we have given to 'them, has been
received back a hundred fold.
That second day at La Panne
seemed a very long one. Every foot
fall we imagined to be Peter's but the
whole day passed and he did not
come. Eigfht o'clock at night, and yet
no Peter. The next day was the day
of our visit to the trenches and as
well, our last of stay in La Panne,
and we knew we should not have
much time to spend with him. Oh, if
he would come this night- So we sat
in our little roof, wishing and even
as we expressed to each other in
words the hearts wish, Peter's knock
fell upon the door. When we opened
the door and saw him standing there,
our brave, unselfish beautiful Peter,
we did what his own father and motli-
er would have done, if his knock I
should have fallen upon their door

Jubilee week in Manchester, the
first public entertainment conducted
under the auspices of the Manchester
Commercial Club, wa3 a pronounced
success. There were no disappoint
ments. The attractions were all given
as advertised and the entertainment
features were even better than antici
pated. The rain Wednesday night and
the threatening weather of Thursday
morning doubtless kept many away
on Thursday which is usually count
ed as being the biggest day. A large
crowd however, was on the grounds
both afternoon and evening. The at

carnival company enjoyed a large
patronage each night and the moving
Picture feature "The Battle Cry of
Peace" filled the amphitheater to over

On Friday afternoon an aeroplane
advertising the Dubuque celebration
flew over from Dubuque to Manches

on the grounds and made an excellent
exhibition flight for half an hour.
The total attendance was over 10,

SIRS REBECCA OTIS SUFFERS
STROKE.
Mrs. Rebecca Otis, sp well known
to Manchester people, and especially
the older people, suffered a stroke of
paralysis on Sunday and has been in
a precarious condition. Little hope
is entertained by her family for her
recovery. For several months past
Mrs. Otis has been making her homr
with her daughter, Mrs. Charles Har
rison at Emmetsburg, la., and it was
at her home that she suffered the
stroke Sunday.
XOTE—As we go to press today a
message was received by relatives
stating that Mrs. Otis had passed
away, and the body would be brought
to Manchester Thursday morning. Fu
neral arrangements are pending the
arrival of Mrs. Harrison, who will ac
company the body. Qbltuary notice
will be published next^ week.
No More Revenue Stamps.
When the new general revenue bill
went into effect Saturday, September
9, the business men throughout the
country were relieved of the stamp
taxes which they have been paying
since December 1, 1914, and which
were to have continue^ until Decem
ber 31 of this year. The general rev
enue bill repealed the emergncy rev
enue bill stamp taxes and the inter
nal revenue bureau has ruled that
revenue stamps are not required af
ter today.
The stamp taxes repealed include
those paid on telegriph and tele
phone mesages, parlor car seats and
Jj6rth" tickets, bonds debentures, cer
tificates of stock, transfers, bills of
sale, promissory notes, express and
freight manifests and bills of lading,

wonder of the scene. As we traversed
the trench for over three kilometres
about 2 miles giving away chocolate!
and little Gospels to the soldeil'S, we I
were received with great interest and
not a little cuiosity. "A lady in the
trenches?" is was unbelievable. Thej
soldiers stared and stared- You are
the first lady they have ever seen
here, the officers said repeatedly- We
were shown the place where only the
day before three soldiers had suffered
one death, two, grave wounds, from
an exploding shell, and were given
the shell head which had been recov-1
ered. We crawled into dugouts,
where were concealed machiue guns,
also saw other in which soldiers were
sleeping and some officers with a
chair and table.
And as we walked through, to our
left, everywhere the graves of fallen
soldiers. Hundreds there were, and
all so carefully tended ornamented,
many of them with bits of stone and
brick, and here and there some care
fully nutured flowers struggling into
bloom. A shell may wipe out their
painstaking efforts one day, but the
next, the soldiers repair the dam age.
A tragic bit of realism was added to
the scene, when we saw staggering
in from the outpost, a bent figure of a
soldier. Over the trench tol we
watehed him come, till he reached
the trench, almost fainting from
weakness. Wounded in the shoulder by
shrapned already the-fiush of fever
was in his face, and his eyes glittered
with the unshed tears that his pain
called forth. Two others there were
at the outpost, more seriously wound
ed than he, but they dare not bring
them in. and they must wait until
nightfoll for medical attention- A bit
of chocolate and a little khaki covered
Testament we slipped into his pocket,
but he was too far gone to notice or
thank us-
So our trip was completed, we
said good bye and thank you, to the
kindly Major of the Regiment who had
accompanied us we accepted two or
three rings from soldiers who pressed
forward to give us these souvenirs of
our visit and once more we took our
perilous way back to the waiting mo
tor car.
Then back again to LaPanne then
in a few hours, saying good bye to
our beloved Peter, and farewell to the
Belgian front. So ended our memora
ble trip, and we turned our faces back
again to our work in London from
whence we could after all best serve
and aid our Belgian boys: For it is
for them that we are living these days
and be ft spiritual help, or temporal
assistance, we have our commission,
and we, are content to serve.
