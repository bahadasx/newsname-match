The great var council being held

unifying the direction of all military
movements by armies of the central
powers. Sines early in the war the
central powers have acted completely

vastly superior enemy forces. That
scheme of unified offense and de

Most favorable reports were
brought to the war council from the

[By Perry Arnold, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.—filiated with
tihe result of the Maine election and
highly pleased with his record break
ing campaign trip, Charles EL 'Hughes*
republican presidential nominee, re
turned to New York early today.
The candidate's trip, which took
him from coast to coast and during
which he made scores of speeches,
kept him on the road Juat three days
more than five weeks. He delivered
the final speech of his trip In Pitts
burgh last night and with Mrs.
Hughes stepped off the train here to
day, somewhat tired, but vigorous
and enthusiastic.
Governor Hughes and Mrs. Hughes
were driven direct to the Astor (hotel
where they had .breakfast and the
candidate then took up the task of a
series of conferences with republi
can leaders.
Chairman Wlllcox, of the national
committee, was the first at the lead
ers to see the candidate. He had
also arranged for
numerous
other re-
pughcana to confer with "MM* aAd" a'
busy day was in prospect
Senator Smoot, of Utah, Murray
Crane, Frank Hitchcock and others
were waiting for a word with Hughes
in going over the campaign trip Just
closed and laying plana for a second
trip to start next Monday. If all con
ferences are disposed of In time, the
candidate hopes to viett republican
headquarters during the day and see
the "wheels go round." At S:00
o'clock this afternoon, however, he
will leave for his summer home at
Bridgehampton, L. I., for a complete
rest before again starting out on his
quest for votes in November.
The candidate plans to avoid as
many conferences as possible during
the remainder of the week. During
today it is expected his complete
itinerary for tho second trip will be
worked out, and announcement will
then be made of his speaking dates.
Hughes is well satisfied with the
results of the trip Just closed and has
made it clear that he intends to
continue the fight along tihe same
line. He will oontlirue to aesail the
administration's method of settling
the threatened railway strike by en
actment of the eight hoar law, attack
the democratic tariff law, continue
his assaults on the democrats in con
nection with the civil service and at
tack the administration's Mexican
policy. He regards his criticism of
the administration as having been
constructive, as well as pointing out
the weakness of democratic rule and
with the success in Maine believes
the people have been aroused to the
Justice of his attacks.
Starting on his second tour Mon
day, Hughes will have the Maine
election to point to as proof of the
reunion of the progressive and repub
lican parties.
