gaged in Collecting Facts

M'CANDLESS INTIMATES
SOME SCHOOLS FAVORED
Says He Has Heard Supervis
ors Did Not Assess Them,
Mentioning Kawaiahao
A report reaching the Star-Bulletin
from an authentic source to the
effect that an effort Is to be made to
block, at least temporarily, road im
provements in Manoa by Injunction,
was not denied today by Attorney J
Lightfoot who Is purported to le
counsel for those hack of the reported
movement
The road Improvements in question
are thse which recently came before
the supreme court in a suit filed by
Bertram von Damm- against City
Treasurer D. L. Conkling to prevent
the Issuance of bonds for the project
The action was on an agreed state
ment of facts, the supreme court
holding that Conkling was justified in
issuing the bonds.
"I am not able to say anything at
this time," said Attorney Lightfoot
when told of the reports which have
reached the Star-Bulletin, and when
asked if he was interested as a law
yer. "Are ypu representing those back
of the purported movement?" was
the next question.
"I am not saying there is anyone
back of It." answered the attorney.
U U McCandless, who recently
hended a movement to block improve
ments on Beretania street under the
frontage tax plan, says that, while he
has bad no definite information that
a movement is on foot to block the
Manoa work, he has &een informed
that the board? of supervisors Jias

anything that is no square. I have
heard that the supervisors nave com
mitted unconstitutional acts in ap
propriating money to assist different
schools in Manoa, and the Organic
Act says that they cannot take pub
lic money for uses of that kind."
McCandless says he has heard that
the supervisors did not assess these
various schools for their share of the
improvement, and that the city and
county Itself Is paying for the work.
He : mentioned Kawaiahao Seminary.
PLAN OF WIEN'S
ENTS:
Fanny Durack and Olga Dorf
ner Not to Be Asked; Hebner
and McGillivray Coming
On the recommendation of William
T. Raw'i'ns, president of the Hawai
ian branch of the Amateur Athletic
Union, the two outstanding features
of the Carnival swimming meet, to be
held on the afternoon of February 22,
Washington's Birthday, will be a
world championship race of 100 yards
between Duke Kahanamoku ' and Per
cy McGillivray of the Illinois Athletic
Club, the national champion; and a
world championship backstroke, eith
er at 100 or 150 yards, between Harry
Hebner. also of the Illinois A. C, and!
"Stubby Kruger of Honolulu. Hebner
Is the world's champion at 15(T yards
backstroke and Kruger is the world's
cnamplon, at 100 yards backstroke.
Rawllns advanced this proposal to
day at a luncheon given by the Car
nival directors in the Commercial
Club, in preference to bringing Fan
ny Durack here from Australia and
Olga Dorfner from Philadelphia, for
a women's world championship com
petition, as was first suggested by the
Star-Bulletin. Apart from all consid
eration of finance and arguing the
matter purely on the basis of giving
the public what it wants to see, Mr.
Rawlins maintained, and the direct
ors agreed with him. that a critical
crowd, such as turns out in Honolulu
for . swimming races, would rather
watch two men champions swim than
two women. Sentiment aside, the
men put up a better race in better
form, and it is form that the public
here demands.
Mayor Lane, who was also present
at the luncheon, added that, with Mc
Gillivray and Hebner here the compe
tition would be between mainland
swimmers and Honolulans. while, if
Miss Durack and Miss Dorfner were
the attractions they would have the
field to themselves, with nobody from
the islands to give them a race.
There was no opposition to these ar-,
guments from the directors and Raw
lins was formally authorized by
