remedies for a solution nf the sirlkn
situation In the event that tho Inter-
Hough chiefs continue In their re
fusal to arbitrate all differences. ,
The ' -st Is n request to Oor. ,
Whitman for nn extra sesilon of tho
I-eclslature at which tho Public Serv
ice Commission will bo Riven power
to force tho running of subway, "I,"
nnd surface car lines.
If this falls tho Mayoi Is expected
to call a incetliiK of the lloaid of

mediately grant a franchise to Hi
New York Motor litis Company, j
which oir.rs to pay the city a hie 1
rental for the prlvllcgo of runnltiK
buses practically from one end of '
Manhattan to tho other.
Ahlernmnle President Kinnk I..
Howling suggested the gnmtlnu of.
tho motor-bus franchise while ills
cussing the situation to-day with an
Kvenlng World leporler. When tin
reporter In turn made tho nukrchMhii
to Mayor Mltchrl he said It was nhoiit '
the best yet iiunlo and that ho would
lliimeiiliituly take It under ailvlso
incut. "I believe that the Now York Motor
Hus Company,,' said Alderman liw
llng, "should bo given i franchise by
the Hoard of ICstlmnto now If for no
other canon than to show Shouts and
Hedley that they oannot tand on a
pedestal and defy the public. Tile
granting of a bus franchise, would re
lic o an Intolerable situation exhulug
among tho poor wage earners of this
city who travel early and late.
"I understand that Shouts nd
Medley have dellantly rejected all
peace proposals made by, Mayor
Mltchel and tho Public Service Com
mission. Something ought to be
donn at open to show thorn that the
peoplo havo some rights over their
own streets on which these private
railroads operate."
James Quncki nbush, counstl to the
Interborouch, when told of the plan
to grant franchises to the N"nv York
Motor Dil n Company, nald.
"There Is hut one comment to make.
In about two yea is the city will tikr
over the subways. Tile motor mil
line would be a direct and powerful
comi!tltor of tlie subwuys and i
gliilitlng the franchises the t't
would M't up opposition to its own
railioad. I'urthermoie, thu city b -gins
pooling with the eleiitcd lines
In about a year and tho new tins
lines would cut down the 'I.' profit.
Lastly, the New York Hallways Com
pany doesn't corn enough to pav tin.
Interest on Its second mortgaito
bonds, and the establishment of oppo
sition would cut down its earnliihs
