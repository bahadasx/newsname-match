PEACE AND
PROSPERITY
SUFFICIENT
That Issue Should Return President Wilson
to the White House, Says .
Senator Gore
PARTY SHOULD FIGHT
LIKE PESSIMISTS
Blind Senator Admonishes Ml Democrats
Not to Fall Into Fatal Error of
Being Too Confident
"There being no campaign in pro
gress in the state, I am just walking
the track," was the opening remarks
of Senator Gore yesterday afternoon
when met by a delegation of Chicka
siia citizens at Verdon. "Like the
young fellow who had just proposed
to his best girl and been accepted, J
ain't got nothing agin nobody."
The Illustrious Oklahoman was In
the best of spirits when welcomed by
the Chiekasha party, consisting of Re
ford Bond, Deputy United States Mar
shal Jim Dillon, M. F. Courtney, G.
W. Barefoot, Judge Frank M. Bailey
and L. C. Hiitson, the, senator being
an occupant of Mr. Dillon's car. He
had just concluded brief visits to Cor
dell, Hobart and Anadarko and was
on his way to Oklahoma City. After
visiting other towns in Oklahoma he
will- actively enter the campaign.
Confers With Democrats.
Upon reaching Chiekasha Senator
Gore entered into a conference with
leading local democrats at which the
issues and probable results of the com
lr.g campaign were discussed. Al
though strong In the conviction that
President Wilson's chances of reelec
tion were growing brighter every day
and that with each succeeding week
the 'star of the former chief justice
was descending toward oblivion, he
yet urged his conferees to exert every
effort to roll up a big majority in Ok
lahoma. Fight Like Pessimists.
"Democrats in this campaign should
fight like pessimists," he tijid to a
representative or me i;ihckhkih vuuy
Express in an interview given later.
"Let no one repose in the security of
an apparent easy victory. Only a few
Democrats have been so rash as to
express the conviction that President
Wilson's re-election Is practically a
certainty and that the members of the
party need feel no -concern-over the
results. With these I take issue. It
devolves upon every member of the
party to make the hardest fight of
which he is capable and leave nothing
to chance or good fortune."
A Winning Slogan.
Senator Gore declared that the issue
which should carry the Democratic
party to victory this year is "peace
and prosperity." These he considered
to be the greatest achievements of the
Wilson administration, standing out
ni.4ocinitiv as dominant factors of
,IV-lUi - "-I ...
Democratic strength in a long and re-
markable record of legislative activi -
ties.
No Forecasts Yet.
Essential data not yet being availa
ble no forecasts can be made at pres
ent as to specific probable results nor
can any basis yet be found for the
usual nuadriennial table of chances.
However, it is safe to say VrkMmt
Wilson's strength is growing steadily
while the current of popular approval
is steadily flowing away from Mr.
Hughes, who has failed to make an
impression with the only available
weapons with which his party is
equipped. Four years ago Senator
Gore was in charge of the tabulation
of this table of chances but that
branch of campaign work has not yet
begun this year.
Dividing Progressive Votes.
The senator, however, believed that
President Wilson would show large
gains over his vote four years ago in
,,-, tates in which the progressives
rolled up their largest votes. In an
a.yzing the defunct Progerssive party
he said it had been made up of three
.lasses of men, the first of whom
were dazzled by the personality of
Colonel Roosevelt but who were later
disillusioned. This following will be
divided in its support of Wilson .!

High Time in Ball Room in Wee Sma'
Hours Causes Raid by Officers
Tuck and Day
Three white men, two negroes and
three negresses as well as a number
lf ..thosc present" who eluded the of-
ficers were singing "After the Ball"
this morning but. to a different tune.
The negro women, girls between the
ages of sixteen and twenty-one, after
a sleepless night, awaited the hour of
sentence in a cell at the city jail,
while the men all gave bond for their
appearances and were 'released.
Had the crowd dispersed at mid
night after the ball at the old Ilex
hall on Dakota avenue all would have
gone well, but, enlivened by the ap
pearance of a few white men, some
of whom are still at large, they creat
ed a disturbance that attracted the at
tention of the officers and caused the
raid.
Of about twenty who were in the
building when Officers Tuck and Day
arrived on the scene all but eight
made their getaway and of the eight
oue of tne nCgroes, Jessie Peek, jump
ed from tne officers' car as the gang
was being driven to Jan. now ever
the speed at which the auto was going
caused the negro to halt where he
landed on the paving and he was easi
ly caught.
The white prisoners were Dave An
gel, C. G. Decker and C. M. Nickerson
and the negro men were Jessie Peek
and Ernest Moore.
The women arrested were Cora An
derson. Alberta Hadley and Ada John
son, the former putting up a cash bond
this morning. Their trials are set for
4 o'clock this afternoon.

GOOD ROAD
MOVE VERY
IMPORTANT
What Must Be Done Before County Markets
May Be Connected for Convenience
oi Traffic
Elmer E. Colby, tho president of
the local branch of the Southwestern
C,ark Trull aswiciatl .mi, In explaining
the necessity for Immediate action
and tho conditions leading up to the
call for Saturday's meeting, said:
"At the meeting held Friday night
the Southwestern Ozark Trail associa
tion decided to take up the matter
generally for the Improvement of the
roads in the county. The discussion
disclosed the fact that it was the opin
ion of those present that little if any
thing eould be accomplished with the
present appropriation, the law requir
ing permanent structures In the way
of bridges and culverts on all classes
of roads, and that the state road con
struction fund should be expended for
permanent construction upon the state
road system. The latter fund in Gra
dy county amounts to approximately
$10,000 and tho state road, system has
a mileage of 2.10 miles. The only
available fund for which is the $10,
000 fund. The maximum road and
bridge levy will raise approximately
$30,OO0. Fifty per cent of this must be
appropriated for repairs and mainte
nance of old wooden structures al
ready existing, the life of which mu
be extended to the maximum as there
is only $15,000 of the $30,000 road and
bridge levy available for
new con-
struction, which,
under the law, must
be permanent.
"The condition that confronts us is
that neither of these funds is suffi
cient to more than begin permanent
construction upon a very small sec
tion of the roads in the county. It is
obvious that the only way to secure
these improvements is to vote a bond
issue adequate for the needs of the
main roads at this time or wait twenty
or twenty-iiva years to begin to secure
the benefits from the expenditures or
the available funds under existing con
ditions. The amount of the bond is
sue will be determined by the mileage
of the system that it Is deemed nec
essary and best to provide for at thin
time.
"The location of these roads and the
necessary mileage and approximate
cost of grading and bridging are ma
ters that we desire to discuss at the
meeting Saturday. This meeting is
called at the court house at 1:30 p. in.
and it is hoped that a large and rep
resentative number of citizens will be
present to discuss this matter."
"The effect of the campaign which
is now being carried cn throughout
the county will be to arouse au inter
est sufficient to determine the matter
for the ai tiou of the county commis
sioners in calling an election to vote
on the question or the proposed iond
issue.
