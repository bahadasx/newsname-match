WITH THE FREPJCII ARMY AT
VKRUUN. Sept. 9.-l-Tho 'Germans
uro now entirely on the defensive at
Verdun.
Tho great battle begun 201 days
ago has now entered Its third and
final stage. The French are steadily
winning back their lost positions.
Tho battlo will gradually die out like
an extinct volcano.
It has now been learned definitely
that tho Germans were forced to re-
move huge quantities' of artillery and
men from Verdua to the Somme front
three weeks ago to' meet tho new
i ,
Anglo-French offensive.
This had an Immediate effect on
the morale of the reajalnlng Ben. In
February they had 'been told they
wcro to capture Verdiin. At the end
ot July they were ddd It would be
sufnefent to slmplydomlnate the sit
uation there. But when they had
been" reduced In numbers to merely a
defensive garrison after nearly seven
months or fighting, their morale was
so shattered that groups of prisoners
have Keen surrendering, some or them

Marseillaise, French officers declare.
Tho seventh and last great German
massed attack was made on both
sides or the Meu6o on July 10th. The
French checked this blow Immediate
ly, and took the offensive. Ever since
that time they have retained the ini
tiative, capturing In their operations
more than 10,000 prisoners, a score of
cannon and a hundred machine guns.
Fighting on the west bank of the
Mouse has practically ceased. Hill
304 and Dead Man's Hill are now
numbered among the glories of the
past.
East of the river the Germans are
concentrating for a final desperate
struggle to retain the forts of Vaux
and Daumont. Even on this sector
their resistance has been. Immeasur
ably weakened. This fact I was able
to ascertiln personally Thursday and
Friday, when the German bombard
mont lot loose as a prelude to an at
tempt to recapture trenches captured
by tho French In tho Vaux Chapttre
and Chenols woods on Wednesday.
This cannonading was Incomparable
to tho terrific Are from the German
guns that marked, the early fighting
around Verdun.
