Stranger Recognizes Murderer in
Barber Shop and Notifies
Officers.
Iron Wood, Mich., Sept. 12.—Arthur
Waltenen, alias John Lind, a barber,
was arrested here today for the mur­
der of Mrs. Elizabeth Nichols, a New
York widow who was strangled to
death in her home, and money and
jewelry to the value of $28,000 stolen.
A servant in the house was sentenced
to be electrocuted for the crime. Wal­
tenen is said by the police to have
confessed.
Mrs. Nichols lived at 4 East 79th
street, New York City, on the night of
September 7, 1915. According to the
confession waltenen is said to have
made to the police, he and three oth­
er men entered the widow's home
through the aid of one of her servants,
Annie Talus, strangled the woman,
and made away with jewelry and mon­
ey.
The men escaped and police suspi­
cion rested on the servant.
Talus finally was arrested and the
strong circumstantial evidence offer­
ed lead to his conviction, and sentence
to the electric chair followed. Friends
of the man interceded for him and his
sentence was commuted last month to
life imprisonment.
A nation-wide search was begun for
Waltenen, whose name was revealed
during the police investigation fol
lowing the arrest of Talus. On July
27, of this year, a stranger from Wau
kegon, 111., entered the barber shop of
Walter Point in this city and recog­
nized an employe therein through a
scar on his finger, as the person want­
ed in New York for the murder of
Mrs. Nichols. The authorities at
New York were notified and officers
from the detective department there
reached here yesterday. Satisfied of
the identity of Waltenen, the arrest
was made today and the prisoner will
be taken to New York tomorrow.

IDEM BODY
Fargo, N. D„ Sept. 12.—A hint that
an independent Democratic organiza­
tion will be latmched in North Da­
kota by reason of state central com­
mittee's turndown of D. H-. McRrthur,
in preparing the platform at the recent
Bismarck meeting came to the surface
tonight in the announcement of the
telegram received by D. H. McArthur,
from David Gprman, chairman of
Grand Forks county central commit­
tee of the Democratic party.
"Democrats of Grand 'Forks county
favor you as their candidate for gov­
ernor. They are with you still and
resent the action of the central com­
mittee in! misrepresenting them at
Bismarck. If the committeemen who
will not support the ticket are not
honorable enough to resign, the Dem­
ocrats here stand ready to form an
independent organization."
Gorman's telegram opens contro­
versy in Grand Forks county that add
to the intensity o( situation. For
each of three members of state com­
mittee from Grand Forks, J. Nelson
Kelly Thomas Griffith, and George
Lashelleat were supporters of the Mc­
Lean element at the state meeting,
and were instrumental in a measure
in pulling over the platform that has
proved so obnoxious to Mr. McArthur,
and which he insists was "put over"
for the sole purpose of appealing to
the nonpartisan league vote, in behalf
of John Burke, candidate for United
States senator.
Mr. McArthur objects to the Demo­
cratic platform as "Socialistic." "It
is not in accord with Jeffersonian
principles of government," said Mr.
McArthur. "It is that the govern­
ment which governs least, governs
best."

Charles W. Fairbanks, vice presiden­

Executive Deals Personally With
Carranza Representatives
for First Time.
EXPRESSES SYMPATHY
FOR DE FACTO GOV'T
New London, Sept. 12.—President
Wilson lent his personal touch today
to aid the efforts of the American
Mexican joint commission in seeking
a permanent foundation of sympathy
and understanding upon which may
rest the future relations of the United
States and Mexico.
Putting aside for one hour, his own
cares and vigil at the bedside of his
sister, who is dying here, Mr. Wilson
exchanged calls with General Carran
za's representatives. It was the first
time during his administration that
the executive had dealt personally
with a representative of the Mexican
de facto government.
For the first time, also, representa­
tives of General Carranza received
directly from the man, in whose hands,
perhaps, lies the fate of their country,
his statement of sympathy with the
aims of the revolution which lias torn
Mexico.
The regeneration of the stricken na­
tion must come from within, Mr. Wil­
son said, and in answer for his col­
leagues and himself, Luis Cabrera,
Carranza's minister of finance and
chairman of the Mexican delegation
asserted that this country was strug­
gling toward the light of free and
democratic government.
Within fifteen minutes after the
Mexican commissioners had returned
to the hotel where the conferences are
taking place, the president's barge
conveyed the executive io the May­
flower on a return visit.

Everybody Working.
There is not an unemployed man

of employes and soldiers ofte:i work
ibehind counters at night. No matter
how poor a workman is, he is in de­
mand. The writer was shaved yes­
terday by a barber who said was
his second week at the trade. He
charged 15 cents for his surgical op­
eration and on Sunday he gets 25
cents from each victim. Hair-cats
cost 35 cents. Coney Island is not
greedier for dimes than Mercedes
and the scale of prices would cause
boycotts in North Dakota. A private
gets 50 cents a day from (lie «vern
ment, and if he wants a few sand­
wiches and a glass of soda he can
spend it in 15 minutes on the r.,ain
street of Mercedes. A hamburger
sandwich with a piece of meat the
size of a silver dollar costs 10 cents.
One wiener in a roll is 10 cents, and
the rolls are a Lilliputian variety,
which the Bismarck men never saw
before they came to the border. Al­
most every article for which the sol­

could be bought in a 10-cent store at

It is not easv for a North Dakota

SPORTSMEN AGREE NOT

Williston, N. D., Sept. 12—Because
ducks are much smaller than usual
at the opening of the hunting season,
sportsmen in this district have agreed
to refrain from hunting in the Zahl
lake region till Sept. 25. The late
spring delayed the hatching season,
and as a result the young birds, in
many instances, are still unable to
fly.
Kidder County Farmer Loses
Blooded Racers Through
Poisoning.
SHOT CRASHES THROUGH
WINDOW, MISSING WIFE
Expected to Race One Trotter at
Morton County Fair This
Fall.
William Campbell, a Kidder County
farmer, charges that a gang has ter­
rorized his farmstead, for the last
two weeks, shooting four horses, pois­
oning five others and shooting into
his home.
Three of the animals shot were
blooded racers that Mr. Campbell
very highly prized. One, Mendel
Chief, made a record of 2:30 while
only a colt. He expected to race him
this fall at the Morton County Fair.
Another, Sorrel Prince, was a trot­
ter with the same record when he
was a colt. Clay had a record of
better than 2:30. The colt was a
son of Menlo Star, by Greenback, the
first 2:12 trotter in Michigan.
Shot Into House.
A week ago someone shot into the
house, breaking a window pane. The
bullet whizzed over the bed in which
Mrs. Campbell was sleeping.
Mr. Campbell charges the crime to
an organized gang. Nothing was done'
with the horses. Two of them were
led out of the barn at night and shot
and the other two were killed in the
pasture.
Mr. Campbell's horses are of the
best racing blood. He has some fifty
head and all of them trace back to
Cassius M. Clay, the great trotting
bred stallion. Every horse that has
made 2:10 or better has his blood.
He bred Perry, 2:16, winner in 1898
of the $25,000 New York purse and
who sold for $25,000.
He came to his Kidder County farm
in 1898.,, ...

GLANDERS EPIDEMIC
IN
Mandan, X. D., Sept. 12.—Two hun­
dred horses in the Blue Grass and
St. Vincent districts, this country,
have been placed in quarantine for
glanders, and 28 animals already have
been killed by federal and state vet­
erinarians. The outbreak of glanders
is one of the most serious experienced
in this district for many years.
One human, it is believed, also was
killed by the disease, Anton Grass
being the victim. He was ill 14 days,
and veterinarians who have since
studied the symptoms, believe he was
taken with the horse disease.
The last previous glanders out­
break in this section was in 1910.

Demands on China Have Nothing
to Do With Infringement
on U. S. Rights.
STATEMENT CONFIRMED
BY CHINESE GOV'T
Washington, Sept. 12.—The Japan
ese government has officially inform­
ed the United States through Ambas
sador Guthrie that, while it has made
important demands on China in con
nection with the recent clash at
Cheng Chaitun, there is nothing in
the replantations Infringing upon
American rights by violating t&e open
door, Chinese integrity of the Root
Takahra agreements. Whether the
Washington government will accept
these representations as conclusive
depends on the attitude Japan shows
in her relations to the Chinese situ­
ation, though it was revealed today
that in an Inquiry on the subject the
Japanese foreign office was notified
that the demands had "greatly dis­
turbed" the American government.
Ambassador Guthrie reported that
the Japanese foreign minister con­
firmed the outlines of the Japanese
demands printed in this country as
"approximately true." A similar con­
firmation from the Chinese govern­
ment was received during the day
through American Minister Reiuisch
at Pekin.
PERU GRAIN CROP
Grand Forks, N. D., Sept. 12.—Grain
crops in Peru are abe^t the same as
those in the United States, with
weather conditions unsatisfactory, ac­
cording to a letter received here by
A. G. Schultheis, from* his brother,
Jesse Schultheis.
Cold weather, resulting in delaying
growth, has prevailed for some time.
The cane is very backward, and that
recently plated, is now sprouting sat­
isfactorily, according to the Peru ad­
vices. Cotton also is a short crop.
Jesse Schultheis is connected with
a Peru copper mining concern, and he
declares the copper production is very
heavy.

Mayor Mitchell Intervenes
New York, Sept. 12.—After Mayor
Mitchell and the Public Serviec com­
mission had taken steps today to ter­

by urging that it be declared off, and
that both sides arbitrate their differ­
ences, plans to continue and extend
the strike were discussed today at a
meeting of the United Labor confer­
ence bodies of Greater New Lork. Af
ter the conference, Hugh Frayne, of
the American Federation of Labor, is­
sued a statement as follows:
"The concensus of opinion among
the various organizations represented
ed was that the railway officials must
be met with the sort of force they are
applying to the men."
Representatives of the men stated
tonight they would not comment on
the plans, or the request to have the
differences arbitrated. Both sides will
be permitted tomorrow to present
their views.
An investigation, started by the cor­
oner after an accident in the Bronx
this afternoon, in which two persons
were killed and many injured, when a
car got beyond the control of an in­
experienced motorman and crashed
into an automobile, revealed that the
strikebreaker had been employed pre­
viously as truckman.

Heavy Offensive of Entente AN

London, Sept. 12.—Resuming their
offensive to the north of tbe Somma
river in France, the (French forces
have again smashed the German lines,
capturing front line and other trench*
es and taking about 1,500 prisoners.
The new attacks, coming after sev
eral days of comparative calm in the
region, where, for weeks past, violent
fighting had been in progress, were
made on the front from the town ot
Combles to the river. So vicious was
the thrust of the French that it re
quired only half an hour for them to
overcome the resistance of the Ger
mans and make themselves masters ot
three and three-quarters miles of
trenches.
Later, east and southeast of Com«
bles, they seized additional trenches
along the Bethune-Peronne road, plac
ing a serious impediment in the way
of the Germans for the movement of
their transports from the north to
Peronne, and making the French po»
sition north of Peronne seemingly" a
menacing one.
On thte British end of the front, loi
on the remainder of th? Hue held by
the French, only butual bombardments
have been taking place:
Heavy Offensive Continues.
All along the Macedonian front the
heavy offensive of the Entente allies
continue. The Bulgarian trenches for
two miles and for a depth of 800 yards
are reported by Paris to have been
captured by the French, west of the
Vardar river, near Majahagh, which
lies about four miles south of the town
of Gievgeli. On the Struma front, the
British, aided by the French, have
made additional gains east of the riv­
er, in the Lake Takinos region. The
armies of the Teutonic allies, are de­
clared to have suffered casualties in
the latter engagement.
Have Evacuated Forts?
Unofficial reports are to the effect
that the Bulgarians have evacuated
the forts at Kavala on the Agean sea,
which they captured in August.
While the presence of the Entente
allied warships oft the town is given
as the reason for the withdrawal, It
is not probable that the menace of
the new drive of the British and
French along the Struma front may.
have been partly responsible for it.
Berlin Reports Progress.
Berlin reports further progress for
the German and Bulgar forces under
command of Field Marshal von Mack
ensen in the Dobrudja region of east­
ern Roumania.
Attacks by the Russians in east Ga*
licia and on the lower Stokhod river,
in Russia, have been repulsed by the
Austro-German forces, according to
Berlin and Vienna. Petrograd re­
ports that in the Carpathians the
Russians have captured several addi­
tional strategic positions, but Vienna
denies the assertion and declares that
all attacks there were repulsed.
The usual bombardments and small
skirmishes continue in the Austro
Italian theatre. The Turks and Rus­
sians are still at grips in Asiatic
Turkey with both sides claiming suc­
cesses.
