Business Meeting. W. M. U.
Met. Death of Mrs. Bet
tie Ready.
' The annual business meeting of
itoe Baptist church was held on Sun
day morning and was one of unusual
interest. There are 355 on the
church roll and as far as possible
all were present. After' the roll call
the church covenant was read. The
reports of the board of deacons, fi
nance committee, ushers, Sunday
school, music committee, W. M. S.,
Y. W. A., G. A., R. A., and Sun
beams were given. In the Sunday
school there are 393 on roll with an
average of 241, the gifts for the
year being $536.40. The aim for the
coming year is "A larger and better
school for Christ." A tribute was
paid to the late William D. Turner,
who with the pastor. Rev. Mr.
Hundley, laid the foundation of the
school. It was through him that the
. Sunday school was set going. The
woman's mission society 79 in num
ber,gave ?607.05 much over their ap
por:ionment and is a report to be
proud of. The.Y. W. A., 9 in num
ber, gave ?23; the G. A., 7 in num
ber, gave ?15; R. A" 16 in number,
gave ?49. The Sunbeams, 2S in num
ber, gave 881.27 about ?2S over ap
portionment. They have done a
wonderful work this year.
The annual letter of the church
to the association at Red Bank, 12th
13th, was read, the church having
contributed to specified objects
?2,624,86. This amount added to
that of the above mentioned organi
zations makes the gifts reach ?3,
89S.9S. The Rev. W. S. Brooke's
letter to the church as pastor con
cluded the meeting, this was ap
preciated by all.
Miss Dassie Stevens united with
the Baptist church here on Sunday
morning bringing her letter from
Good Hope. The church is glad to
have this consecrated woman iden
tified with them and she was warm
ly received.
Miss Ruth Harris of Derring, Ga.,
will attend school here this winter
and will spend the time in the home
of her grandmother, Mrs. P. N.
Lott.
The annual meeting of the W.
M. U. of the Ridge association was
held with the Batesburg Baptist
. church last Tuesday and Wednes
day with a splendid attendance and
the two days' sessions showed that
a spirit of mutual co-operation had
marked the year's work.
A royal welcome was given the
delegation both in action and speech
but there was really no verbal ex
pressions needed, for it is said that
"welcome always smiles," and as
every face was beaming upon the
visitors they knew they were wel
come. The Batesburg church was
beautiful in its decorations for this
eventful occasion, and Miss Chloe
Nicholson called the meeting to or
der with Miss Leila Attaway at her
post. Miss Attaway has for the past
few months acted as associational
supei intendent as Mrs. Alvin Ether
edge was forced to resign on ac
count of her health. In the union
there are IS churches with 17 so
cieties, this representing 300 mem
bers. The Johnston missionary so
ciety led in gifts something over
?600, and the Johnston Sunbeams
received the banner, being appor
tioned ?50 and giving ?75.27. The
reports on personal service were
sweet and interesting for it showed
that much had been done for the
* Master's sake.
One church stated that they had
done much but did not tell of it,
said God had recorded it. The ap
portionment for the year was ?1,
907, and the union raised ?1,976.80.
The apportionment for 3 917 is
, ?2,018. The acting superintendent
'stated that by every one doing her
part this can be done as "Strength
is through united effort."
After all reports had been heard
a most instructive and interesting
short address was given bv Mrs.
Mamie Tillman on "History of the
progress of the missionary society
in South Carolina."
The music of the session was
lovely and Miss Miriam Norris of
Edgefield gave during the day two
beautiful solos. The afternoon was
. the children's session, Mrs. W. J.
Hatcher presiding. The procession
of the children with banners as they

HARDY'S HAPPENINGS.
Farmers Harvesting Hay. A
Good Sermon at Sweetwa
ter. Dr. Shaw Suffers
From Broken Arm.
Dear Advertiser: Sunday was a
grand day, so delightfully cool to
what we baye had all the week, for
it was surely hot and dry enough
all during the week for curing hay
and opening cotton.
Several farmers were considera
bly worried Saturday when the
clouds began to rise, as tbey bad so
much bay to get up, and that being
"Christmas eve" in Augusta, on
McKinney St., with the negroes,
there were none to be had to help
get it np. But with hard fast
work they succeeded in getting: all
that was cut under shelter. Now
we would like very much to see a
a good season of rain. The cotton
is opening very fast and has been
gathered quite fast, and marketed.
Several'-of the fields we noticed have
very little more to opeu the most of
it having already been picked. Well
it will soon be all out and sold.

by Rev. Mr. Reynolds. We did not
get there in time for the text or for

fine and we hope to see her out

Southern Will Arrange Special
Train.
Washington, D. C., Sept. 10-Ar
rangements have been made by the
Southern Railway to run a special
train carrying dairy farmers and
others interested in the building up
of the dairy interests in the South
to the National Dairy Show to be
held October 12-21 at Springfield,
MasSi, at which the Southern will
have.an extensive exhibit giving a
full presentation of the South as a
dairy section at the present time,
and as a region for the future devel
opment of the dairy industry.
Thje idea of the special train from
the]S?nth to the dairy show, which
is held in the East for the first time
thh'yiear, is to give Southern dairy
farmers an opportunity to see how
. i. 'J4_> ......_ _J_."J . :_ .L_
tlio^M-lcetry is conducted- in the |
North, and to widen their outlook
by bringing them in contact with
successful dairy farmers and dairy
workers from all parts of the coun
try, while a general attendance at
the dairy show on the part of South
ern dairymen is expected to do a
great deal to educate the people of
the North as to the advantages of
the South for the industry.
Pullman cars will be started from
central points in each State, and
will be made into a solid train into
New York abd to Springfield. The
special will start probably on Thurs
day, October 12, reaching New
York on Saturday, October 14.
Already nearly a hundred dairy
farmers located from Virginia to
Mississippi have indicated their in
tention to become members of the
party. New England people have
contributed $050,000 for the erec
tion of buildings at the show and
more than one thousand pure blood
dairy cattle of the various breeds
will be on exhibit, besides a com
prehensive collection of the most
approved implements and machinery
used in connection with the dairy
industrv.
In connection with the trip, ar
rangements are also being made for
stop-overs and side trips to allow
the Southern dairymen who go to
visit the most interesting milk-pro
ducingcenters of the East, including
the pasturizing and distributing
plants at New York, the railroad
warehouses in Jersey City, where
over two million quarts of milk are
shipped daily to New York by spe
cial trains, the Mixter farm, an
hour's ride from Springfield, famous
for the breeding of pure-bred Guern
sey cattle, and Washington, where
the party will visit the United States
Department of Agriculture and the
Bureau of Animal Industry.
Two Additional Buyers.
Edgefield has two more cotton
buyers than it had last week,
which will doubtless lead to more
spirited bidding for the fleecy sta
ple. Mr. S. B. Marsh has arranged
to buy at Edgefield this season and
also bas a representative at Trenton.
The other buyer is Mr. W. P. Saw
yer of Ridge Spring. He is an ex
perienced cotton man and will be a
considerable factor in the Edgefield
market.
We have just received a large
shipment of ladies' coat suits and
will have in our entire line in a few
days.

BAPTIST ASSOCIATION.
Very Profitable Session He!
at Stevens Creek Church.
Large Attendance. Good
Addresses.
The Baptist association met wit
the Little Stevens Creek church c
Wednesday September 6. This is
very large church building and tl
good people of this church have pi
iu some great improvements in tl
way of two dressing rooms one o
each side of the pulpit and a ba)
tismal font in rear of the palpi
There was a good crowd on han
and the Meeting Street people ha
made abundant preparation fo
their guests. After a short devotiot
al service the meeting was called t
order by the moderator Mr. C
Sheppard with Mr. J. T. Littlejoh
on hand as secretary and Mr. S. i
Mays as treasurer. The choir hav
a separate elevated rostrum raile
off and the singing was fine unde
the leadership of Miss Lena Steven?
The chair welcomed the visitin?
brethren to wit: Dr. C. C. Brown
Mr. Watts, Dr. Derieux, Rev. Mr
Bell, Rev. G. VV. Bussey who look
as hale and hearty as ever, Rev
Snuggs, J. L. Bristow.
Mr. Sheppard proceeded to cal
the roll of the churches represente?
and nearly every church responde*
with delegates and church letters
The election of officers was nex
taken up and the same officers wer
re-elected to wit: Moderator, O
Sheppard; secretary, J. T. Little
john; treasurer, S. B. Mays. Mr
Sheppard made a very warm anc
tender talk on his re-election anc
expressed his high appreciation o:
this confidence as he said that he
had been serving as moderator foi
twenty years and we can truly sa:
he has made a faithful and efticien
officer all this time.
The order of business was ther
jread by J. K. Allen who. is one o:
the leading members and, with hi;
good wife, is as hospitable as he ii
active.
Short reports were then mad?
from the different churches, all veiy
encouraging.
Then came the report on agec
ministers. Dr. 0. C. Brown spoke
to this subject in a most able anti
instructive manner showing the ur
gent needs for funds to help sup
port some of our worthy old preach
ers who have worn out in the ser
vice of God. After some other talk:
on!this subject on motion of Dr,
Pendleton Jones a good collectior.
was taken up for this most worthy
cause.
After some inspiring songs, din
ner was served out under the shady
oaks and it was a most delightful
and abundant variety of the best of
food just as one would expect in
this neighborhood of good provid
ers. During the intermission, Dr.
Pendleton Jones had all the pastors
and many deacons and officers of
the different churches to meet with
him and it was agreed to have
regular quarterly meetings of the
pastors and deacons and officers of
the various churches in this division.
This is good as we should not neg
lect the assembling of ourselves to
gether.
In the afternoon the report on
Sunday schools was read by W. B.
Cogburn and it was a fine one, as
his heart is in this work. The report
was followed by a masterly speech
by Mr. Watts, State superintendent
of Sunday schools, who surely
knows what he is talking about.
Then came the report on State mis
sions which was made by Rev. P.
B. Lanham, a good one too. This
was followed bv a most excellent
speech by Dr. Derieux. One idea
he elucidated was the importance of
having a parsonage in country
churches and let the pastor live right
among his flock. How can a Shep
herd look after his sheep when he
does not see them but once a month?
Then came the report on hospital
by Mr. L. J. Bristow. After this
was the report on Temperance by
Mr. W. J. Gaines. This was a good
report both practical and instruct
ive.
These annual gatherings do much
good in many ways, enlarging the
graces of Christian fellowship, kind
hospitality and renewal of old ac
quaintances as well as a spiritual
revival and upbuilding of the many
causes sustained by the Baptist de
nomination. The great tide of coun
try people moving to town is weak
ening the good old country church

Farmers Picking Cotton. Pleas
ed With Price. Able Sermon
by Dr. E. Pendleton
Jones.
I can not help writing a few lines
to The Advertiser this beautiful
fall morning. It is so cool and
bracing that we realize the fall of
the year is here.
Our farmers are rapidly picking
the snow-white cotton and are rush
ing it to market, being so glad to
get 15 cents.
The attendance at church Sunday
was small but we heard a grand ser
mon by our pastor, Dr. E. Pendle
ton Jones. We hope he will 3erve
us as pastor for another year.
We were glad to have with us at
Horn's Creek Sunday at our regu
lar service Mr. J. R- Cantelou and
his son, Mr. J. Trapp McManus,

Two Negroes Dead, Three in
Jail.
Saturday afternoon about five
miles north of Edgetield the ne
groes of the community held a Sun
day school picnic. It appears how
ever that the Ruler of the Lower
Regions directed the affairs of the
occasion. In a shooting scrape, in
which about 20 shots were fired,
two negroes, Lewis Owens and Bet
tis Brooks, were killed, shooting
each other to death. The grievance
was an old one and had its origin
in improper attentions shown
Brook's wife ?by the Owens negro.
The sympathy of the community is
with Brooks and his friends. In ad
dition to these two men being shot
to death, Will Adams was wounded
in the arm and a woman who was
sitting in a buggy near by was also
slightly injured. Sheriff Swearingen
went at once to the scene and arrest
ed Will Adams, UPaul Owens, Jr.,
Ulis Owens and brought them to
jail. A characterless woman, to
gether with some mean liquor, was
the cause of the trouble.

people to any country district is a
great blessing.

(The editor of The Advertiser
was unable, on account of the press
of business, to attend the associa
tion at Stevens Creek last week.
By request Mr. Arthur Tompkins
made the above excellent report of
the first day'stsession but as he was
not present the second day he could
make no report of that day. We
have been informed that the second
day of the association was also very
profitable. The next annual session
will be held at Rehoboth.)
