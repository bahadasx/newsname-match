council had signed a deci-ee
sustaining practically all
charges against Commission

prepared, they said, to vote
to impeach him, attorneys for
the commissioner on Wed

prohibition from Superior
Judge Clifford preventing
further action.
» The writ acts In the same force
as a restraining order.
It completely prevents the
council for the present from con
tinuing its efforts to impeach
Drake.
Arguments will begin in Judge
Clifford's court Thursday morn
ing between City Attorney Har
mon and Drake's attorneys, on
the question of breaking the writ.
In his application, Drake de

Baby Finds Home

(United Press Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Bept. 13.—A two
days old baby boy abandoned on
the doorstep of William Salomon,
wealthy banker, last night prob
ably will be adopted by the Salo
mons and become an heir to the
banker's millions, It was said at
the Salomon home in Fifth ave

A dinner party was In progress
at the Salomon home when a mall
carrier, arriving with some let

and discovered the Infant.
The butler was about to carry
the baby to the police station,
when Mrs. Salomon rushed out In
an evening gown. She cuddled
the youngßter up In her arms; the
cry ceased, and what all the Salo
mon guests swore was a smile,

that the council's impeaching

has been superseded by the state

The voters, and not the council,

gument.
The council had expected an

and showed no surprise when the
prohibition orders were served as
they met for the weekly legisU-

Earlier in the day each coun

to a document prepared by Har

the impeachment trial WM based,

UP AGAINST IT BADLY
THERE'S A FUNNY SIDE TO AN
i ELECTION, WOMAN DISCOVERS
By Mabel Abbott
There are a lot of funny
things about an election.
The candidates, for in*
stance.
Alho the voters.
Also the places where the
voters vote for the candi
dates.
A trip around the polling places
of the city yields more varieties
and contrasts of "local color"
than a book of short stories.
For instance, voters living in

primaries in the auction rooms cf

among boxes of glassware, sec
ond-hand books, bundles of
brooms, an Invalid's chair, some
school desks, and other miscel
laneous articles.
In "Blllle's Place."
Precinct 51 climbed, the stairs
• t 1330H Pacific avenue, went
through the building to an empty
store-room, and after casting its
votes, emerged on Commerce st.,
to discover from the sign on the
window that it had been in what
used to be "Blllle's Place."
Voters in precinct 33 walked
through the gate of a neat resi
dence at 719 South Grant street,
as if they were going to call on
the family; then proceeded
around to the back of the house
as if they were going to call on
the hired girl: and then went on
through the back yard to the barn
as If they were going to call on
the cow.
There was neither cow nor
horse in the barn, however, and It
was as good a place to vote us
any of the others.
Smell of Sawdust.
In precinct 25, voters found the
ballot boxes In the reading room
of the Seamen's Institute, under
St. Luke's parish house, where
ordinarily sailors from the seven
seas congregate In their hours
ashore, to spin strange yarns,
write ietters with outlandish ad
dresses, and study the marine col
uhis of the papers.
Precinct 85 voted contentedly

In precinct 72, voters found
their way through a flower gar

LEAD 1. PRIMARY COUNT
The old gang's slate is smashed!
That is the Mg, outstanding fact tial loomed out early Wednesday after
noon from an exceedingly slow and Mattering canvass of the votes cast, iii the
state wide primaries.
Senator Poindexter, it appears certain, is renominated. Later returns, it
is predicted, will greatly increase his lead.
In 50 Tacoma precincts Poindexter had a lead over Humphrey hy nearly
1,001) rote*. He had 2463 first choice M compared with Humphrey's 1407.
Bryan is piling up an immense sec uid-choice total.
Humphrey, the hosses 1 choice, is decisively heaten and may he third in
the contest.
Mclhide is nominated as governor, with Hartley probably second and Sut
lon third. McNeely, of Tacoma, carried this county, and is developing eon
tiderablc second-choice strength in Spokane and elsewhere.
Lee, the machine candidate, is whipped thoroughly.
Johnson has defeated Fawcett decisively for congressman in this district.
All inciiiiihents of supreme and superior courts are renominated. Webster
II also named for the supreme hench, an! Kvans, Fletcher, Nash and Johnston
Appear to he leading for the superior.
The state officers are all renominated apparently. v
The Pierce county court house "ins", including Morris, Cameron, Long
uiire, McKen/ie, etc., have defeated the "outs," except perhaps in the case of
coroner, where Brown appeals to have beaten Stewart.
