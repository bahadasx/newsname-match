Schools Open Monday.
Unless new orders are issued from
the state board of health, schools will
begin next Monday throughout the
state. There are a few cases of paral
ysis in the state but it is in no sense
considered an epidemic.
Barton academy and graded schools

have been held up three weeks. In
some respects this is an advantage but
will have a tendency to shorten vaca
tions and make commencement a little
later. Everything is in readiness for
opening.

and the large audience was kept in
laughter and applause for nearly two
hours. Everyone went away feeling
that they had had their money's worth
The Christian Endeavor society of
the Congregational church, under
whose auspices it was given, added 'a
snug sum to their treasury.

Other Election News.
C. S. Page won the U. S. senatorial
nomination yesterday by a vote which
surprised even his most ardent support
ers, carrying every county in the state.
H. F., Graham of Craftsbury was
nominated governor on the Republican
ticket without opposition, which is as
good as an election.
J. E. Weeks of Middlebury is about
200 ahead of R. W. Hulburd of Hyde
Park for lieutenant governor in the
state according to incomplete figures
obtained just before going to press.
Benjamin Gates was leading Cave for
auditor but returns have been so slow
about coming in that definite informa
tion is not yet obtainable.
In the county the death of Caswell
left the north end without a senatorial
contest and Adams therefore polled the
largest vote, 1606. In the south end
Russell of Irasburg won by a substan
tial vote over N. B. Williams of
Craftsbury.
There were no other county contests,
Colby Stoddard of Orleans being nomi
nated for state's attorney and the
rest of the ticket as published in these
columns two weeks ago.
