Berlin, Sept. 13. The cc bined "grand offensive" of
the allies will be met by a co $ined "grand-defensive" of
the central powers, who will & -?ng to the attack when the
proper time comes.
The great war council being held at the kaiser's head
quarters on the eastern front is for the purpose of unify
ing the direction of all military movements by armies of
the central powers. Since early in the war the central
powers have acted completely in accord with their mili
tary movements, making it possible to beat off vastly
superior enemy forces. The scheme of unified offense
and defense will be made even more effective as the re
sult of the present conference attended by war chiefs of
the four empires warring on the allies.
Most favorable reports were brought to the war coun
cil from the different fronts. The Austro-German com
manders sent word that the latest Russian offensive
around Halitz has been stopped. It was learned that the
German and Bulgarian invasion of Rumania continues to
make progress while the Bulgarians are successfully re
sisting British and Serbian attacks in Greece.
The capture of the Rumanian fortress of Silistra is re
garded as of special importance by the German and Bul
garian commanders. The position is considered the key
to tfucnarvst. , -
. French Capture Stronghold. j
Paris, Sept. 13. Continuing their
great drive on the front of Combles and
l'eronne, the French lust night cap
tured the whole of the village of Bouoh-'
nvesnes, midivny between Combles and
l'eronne and despite the Germans most j
desperate resistance, it was officially
announced today. I
Korly this morning the French pushed'
further eastward, capturing the Boisi
).nbe farms near the lYronneBupnunie-1
Itothune highway, by a brilliant bay-l
onet charge.
The trench gains in the great attack
that began yesterday afternoon are of
the greatest importance. The positions
carried are the last of the strongly
fortified (Serinnn third line of defense
between Combles nnd Peronne. All the
positions now held by the Germans back
f this line have been built under the
unceasing fire of French artillery and
consequently are not nearly so strong
as the old lines.
The capture of both Combles and Pe
rmute within a fortnight is expected
1v some militry critics if Gen. Foch
continues his hammer blows north of
the Sonime.

He expressed approval of President

those who criticise the president's

He declared that Dr. Aked had call

"The good doctor could not manage
Ltho peace commission the way he
thought it ought to be managed and
therefore became very disgruntled and
dissatisfied. So it became inevitable
that the other members of the commis

he went nnd the commission is getting

HUGHES
PLEASED
F
Reaches New York Having
Completed Five Weeks and
Four Days Trip
HITCHCOCK, CRANE AND
SM00T TO CONSULT HIM
Will Continue to Assail Wilson
Considering That His Best
Ammunition
By Perry Arnold
(United Press staff correspondent)
New York, Sept. 13 Returning to-
6y from his record breaking trip of
nearly ten thousand miles through 25
states, republican nominee Charles E.
Hughes immediately plunged into the
work of completing arrangements for
a second campaign tour which will car
ry his fight for the presidency into
four state of the middle west.
It has been definitely decided that
Hughes will make two set speeches in
Illinois, two in Wisconsin and ten or
twelve in Indiana and Ohio. Follow
ing the speeches in Springfield and l'e
oria on September 19, announced yes
terday, the candidate will go to Wis
consin for speeches tn Madison and
Wilwaukee, Dates for these speeches
and others to follow in Indiana and
Ohio have not been set. Tiie candi
date will complete tins part of his trip,
however, in time to reach l'ittsburg on
September 27. He will speak there on
that date and will deliver the keynote
address of the New York state cam
paign before the unofficial state con
vention at Saratoga on September ilS.1
As Hughes will .leave New iork next
Monday the trip will last just ten
days.
. it was learned today that the can
didate feels very bitter toward news
papers which have endeavored to cre
ate the impression that his trip just
closed h a failure and that he was
received with little enthusiasm.
"We have had a most successful
trip," Hughes declared. "Everywhere
a great deal of interest was shown and
the cordiality of the people was mark
ed. In this respect the situation in
Maine is no different from that in
other states. 1 feel that there is every
reason Cor confidence."
From now on Hughes will center his
efforts on doubtful states, instead of
speuking In commonwealths that are
normally republican. This decision was
reached during a political conference
during a luncheon given by Chairman
Willcox for the candidate today and
attended by several members of the
campaign committee. The Maine vic
tory bus convinced the republican lead
ers, it is understood, that the appear
ance of the candidate is not necessary
in republican strongholds and that he
can give practically all of his time to
touring the doubtful states. This means
tjiut most of Hughes' canimigniug will
from now on be in the middle west and
south.
Long Campaign Ended.
New York, Sept. 13. hinted with the
result of the Muine election And highly
pleased with his record breaking cuiu
puign trip, Charles Kvuns Hughes, re
publican presidential nominee returned
to New York early today.

from coast to coast and during which
he made scores of speeches, kept him on
the road just three days more than five
weeks, lie delivered the final speech
of his trip in l'lttttsburg lust night and
with Mrs. Hughes stepped off the train
here today somewhat tired but vigorous
and enthusiastic.
Governor Hughes aud Mrs. Hughes
were driven direct to the Astor hotel
where they hud break fust and the can
didate then took up the task of a series
of conferences w ith republican leaders.
Chuirman Willcox of the national
. committee, was the first of the leaders
to see the candidate, tie Una also ar
ranged for numerous other republicans
to confer with him and a busy day was
in prospect.
Senator Smoot of Utah. Murray
Crane, Frank Hitchcock and others
were waiting for a word with Hughes
in eoinu over the campaign trip just
closed and laying plans for a second
jtour to start next Monday. If all eon-
Iferences are disposed of" in time the
j candidate hopes to visit republican
( headquarters during the day and see
" wheels go around." At 3 o'clock
I this afternoon, however, he will leave
lfor his summer home at Bridgehamp
jton, I.. I., for a complete rest before
again starting out on his quest for
votes in November.
The candidate plans to avoid as many
conferences as possible during the re
mainder of the week. During today it
is expected his complete itinerary for
the second trip will be worked out, and
announcement will then be made of his
speaking dutes.
Will Speak on Same Line.
Hughes is well satisfied with the re
sults of the trip just closed and has
