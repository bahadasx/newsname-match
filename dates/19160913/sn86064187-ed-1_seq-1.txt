This is taken in entente capitals to
mean that the rrtiremrnt ot the .

allirs. Rrrrnt dispatchrs from Rrrlin
and Virnna show that thrre also it is
rrgardrd as probablr Grrrce will soon
abandon neutrality and join the entente
powers.
Cause Uncertain.
The precise causes which led to the
resignation of the ministry have not
brrn disrlosrd on account of the ex
crptionally rigid crnsorship. A dis
patch Tursday said M. Zaimis had)
complained that internal incidents were
preventing him frojn dealing with the
external situation.
Neutrality Impossible.
It is believed in London that hit
resignation was due to the fart that
br accrptrd the premiership on the un
derstanding that he was to maintain
neutrality and m view of the Dulgariart
occupation of Greek territory had found
this impossible.
Neutral No Longer.
Aftrr thr fall of the Veniirlos cab

agrrrmrnt with his policy favoring in
trrvrntion in the war with the allies,
M. Zaimis was called on to form a cab

neutrality. The cabinet resigned in No

he was regarded as having a predispo
