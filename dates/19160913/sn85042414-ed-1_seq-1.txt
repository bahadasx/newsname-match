PEACE BOYCOTT
AVAjNIHOVE
"Frankfurter Zeitung" Says
England Will Gladly Re
sume Trade.
London, Sept. 18.—In an article on
the "War After the War," the Frank
farter Zeitung discusses at considera
ble length the proposed boycott of
German oommerce after the war, as
MNMWnoed by Premier Asqulth, and
|ftps there is no reason for alarm at
the prospeot.
To begin with, it insists, the Allies
do not know their own minds and are
unable to explain what they want or
What they intend. The writer of the
lurtiele is prepared to And English in
dustry working at higher pressure
after the war than ever before. That
fir only natural, he says, because "In
View of the diminished purchasing
power of the world" everybody will
pave to work more than before. He
continuee:
"Let England found technical
vchoola (but from there to an English
pharlottenburg is a long, long way),
let her try to found a chemical indus
try with state help. Such artificial
creations only show, after all, that
deep down the English people has
lost oonfldence In that whloh was
Wont to be Its pride and strength—
the efficiency of the free man of bus
iness, responsible to no one but him-
Klf,
relying on himself alone. From
em we had more to fear than from
those who can only hobble on erutoh
es supplied by the state. Here we see
Dew German triumphs In peace timet."
In the view of the writer, the rest of
}ffr. Aaqulth's speech is, and will be to
the end of the chapter, empty rhet
oric!
"In order to translate his threats
Into practice," he says, "two things
are necessary—Germany must be
Drought absoultely to her knees, and
there must be unity In the plans of
the Entente. The one Is as likely to
happen as the other."
If the other Allies refuse to grant
to Germany the most favored nation
treatment they will simply erect a
British monopoly against themselves,
the Bntente nations favor each oth

arms of America and the other neu
Ural powers. And, after all, the argu
ment concludes, irons of ttfem can af

SHIPPERS EXPECT
AMICABLE SOLUTION
Duluth, Minn., Sept. 13.—Threaten
ed trouble with the Longshoremen's
unions of Duluth and Superior which
has caused some uneasiness among
the grain shippers of the head of the
lakes will be amicably settled to the
Satisfaction of the unions, according
to W. F. Smith, secretary of the Su
perior union.
The system of employing non-union
men to work with union grain trim
mers which was at first thought to
have been the seat of the trouble, has
little to do with it, said Mr. Smith.
"The whole trouble which has stirred
up trouble at both ends of the Great
Lakes Is the fact that stevedores are
employed and hire the men to trim
the boats," he said. "The longshore
men do not believe that they are get
ting what is coming to thexn and wish
to ao away with the stevedore system
entirely.
"I think the difficulty will be all
straightened out and we do not look
for any tie-up."

FARM LABOR IS
BKPR06LEM
Time is Past When Farmer
Can Pick Men Up on
Streets.
Bismarck, N. D., Sept. 13.—"The
time when the farmer can go to town
and pick up harvest help from the
streets is at an end. He must make
plans to so adjust his labor to ex
tend over the entire year and must
make arrangements for his help be
fore season." This is the opinion of
T. L. Stanley of the United States
Department of Labor, who is working
in co-operation with Commissioner
Flint of the North Dakota Depart
ment of Agriculture and Labor.
There are many reliable men far
ther east who could be secured by
farmers here if they might have a
specific Job awaiting them on their
arrival. The splendid opportunities
of the west for the young man. and
his craving to have a piece of land
of his own Is the cause of his desiring
to locate here,, but with the present
chaotic method of placing labor, many
out of a good class of help are kept
away.
If the farmer who is just now un
der-going the difficulties of getting a
sufficient amount of reliable labor
would capitalize his experience and
begin to look for help for the next
year, this department would be in a
position to assist him. The best part
of the proposition is that the help
thus secured would. In most cases, be
of a better class and would become
an important part of the state's de
velopment. As it is the present labor
situation drains the state of a large
percentage of its earnings.
The farmer who will face facts as
they stand and make an effort to so
adjust his work to give steady em
ployment. make arrangements plenty
of time, take good care of his labor,
will not only always have good la
bor, but will get his farm work done
cheaper than his neighbor who ne
glects to consider his labor problem
until he needs it."

ADVISES WILSON
TO TAKE WARNING
Chicago, Sept. 18.—Miss Alice Paul,
chairman of the Congressional Union
for Woman Suffrage yesterday issued
a statement on the Maine election in
which she said
"The overwhelming defeat of the
democratic forces in Maine indicates
how necessary to Mr. Wilson will be
the ninety-one electoral votes in the
twelve western states, where women
vote to enable him to win in Novem
ber.
"We suggest to Mr. Wilson that he
take heed before it is too late and
call a special session of congress to
pass the national woman suffrage
amendment. Only in this wav can he
hope to avert the vote against him
and his party in these twelve doubtful
western states by the members of the
woman's party, who have pledged
themselves to use their votes to pre
vent the return to the white house
and to congress of the opponents of
the national woman suffrage amend

mats renewed their Interest in the
Greek situation. Immediate action
is anticipated, and the London and
Paris governments make no secret
of their belief that the next step
will be the entry of Greece Into the
war on the side of the entente.
The French and English continue
their terrific drive on the Somme
front. Bouchavcsnes. located in the
Combles district, has fallen into the
hand6 of the French. On the Ver.
dun front, the French also con
tinued their advance.

Cabinet Resigns.
Athens, via London, Sept. 18.—
French and Serbian troops have taken
the offensive on the western end of
the Macedonian front. They cap
tured the town of Sorovitz, near
Fiorina. King Constantine has ac
cepted the resignation of Premier
Zaimis and his cabinet.
London, Sept. 13.—The belief is en
tertained in the Entente capitols that
the retirement of the Zaimis ministry
is preliminary to the entrance of
Greece in the war with the Allies.
Recent dispatches from Berlin and
Vienna show that there also it is re
garded ae probable that Greece soon
will abandon her neutrality and join
the Entente.
The precise causes leading to the
resignation of the ministry have not
been disclosed, on account of the ex
ceptionally rigid censorship.
It is believed here that the resigna
tion is due to the fact that Zaimis ac
cepted the premiership on the under
standing that he was to maintain neu
trality and that in view of the Bul
garian occupation of Greek territory
he had found this impossible.
