Resuming their offense to the north
of the Somme river in France, the
French forces have again smashed the
German line, captured front line and
other trenches and taken about 1,500
prisoners.
The new attacks, coming: after sev
eral days of comparative calm in the
region where for weeks past violent
righting had been in progress, were
made on the front tl the town of Com
bles to the river. So viciously was the
thrust of the French that it required
only half an hour for them to over
come the resistance of the Germans
and make themselves master of three
and three-quarters miles of fir3t lino
trenches.
Later east and southeast of Combles
they seized addiSonal trenches along
the Berhune-Peronne read, which leads
from Peronne northward through Ba
paume and Arras to Eethune, placing
a serious impediment in the way of
the Germans for the movement of their
transports from the north of Peronne
nnd making the French position north
of Peronne seemingly a menacing one.
On the British end of the front and
fin the. remainder of the line, held by
Lho French only mutual bombardments
look place. A'l along the 'Macedonian
Tront the heavy offensive of the entente
lilies continues. Eulgarian trenches

WITH MEXICAN COMMISSIONERS
Discussed Future Relations Between
the United States and Mexico.
New London, Conn., Sept. 12. Pres
ident Wilson lent his personal pres
pnee today to aid the American-Meri-can
joint commission in seeking a per.

understanding o.n which may rest the
future relations of the United States
and Bfexico.
Putting aside for an hour his own
cares and his vigil at the bedside of
his sister, who is dying here, Mr. 'Wil
son exchanged calls with General Car
ranza's representatives. It was the
first time the executive had dealt per
sonally with a representative of the
Mexican de facto government and the
significance of this fact was not lost
on the commissioners.
For the first time also representa
tives of General Carranza received di
rectly from the man in whose hands
perhaps lies the fate of their country
his statement of sympathy with the
alms of the revolution which has torn
Mexico.
The regeneration of the stricken na
tion must come from within, Mr. Wil
son said; and, in answer for his col
leagues and himself, Luis Cabrera,
Carranza's minister of finance and
chairman of the Mexican delegation,
asserted that his country was strug
gling toward the light of free and
democratic government.
Mr. "Wilson laid great stress, it was
learned, on the point as to the present
conference upon which both Secretary
Lansing and Secretary Lane centered
their remarks at the first meeting of
the commission in New York, the pro
tection of American lives and proper
ty In Mexico.
The president said he hoped the
commission would be successful in
finding a solution for its problems
which would insure the security of
Americans, not only along the border.
but in any part or Mexico.

OF FIRST CAMPAIGN TRIP.
Tells Audience He Comes as Spokes
man of a Reunited Republican Party.
Plattsburgh, N. Y., Sept. 12. Charles
E. Hughes, in the last speech of his
first presidential campaign trip, as
serted here tonight before a crowd
that filled the opera house that the
result in Maine had proved the re
publican party was reunited. He de
clared the party would not "change
its plans or aims."
Persons in the audience took the
reference to apply to criticisims of the
methods pursued in conducting the
present campaign and applauded the
nominee vigorously.
."I come to you." Mr. Hughes said,
"as spokesman of a reunited repub
lican party. We have said it was re
united, we have devoutly hoped it was
reunited. Now Maine proves it is re
united. Whoever was skeptical about
that before must hide his cynicism
now. We shall abandon no efforts.
We shall not change our plans or aims,
but we shall go forward with renew
ed confidence because the old state in
the northeast corner has spoken in
no uncertain voice."
Mr. Hughes assailed the Wilson ad
ministration for failure to reduce the
cost of living, for extravagance, for
failure to protect American lives and
rights abroad and for failure to "live
up to its promise to observe tho
merit system." The nominee em
phasized previous declarations that
the . campaign was a "good natured
one. He delighted, he said, to call
his political opponents his "friends on
the other side."

GENERAL ASSEMBLY
$100,000 FOR FAMILIES
Mileage Bill Called for $5,587.50 For
Expenses Incident to the Session
$10,000 Additional Was Voted Ad
journed at 5 p. m.
Hartford, Conn.., Sept. 12. The gen
eral assembly, in the first special ses
sion since the days of Governor Buck
ingham in 1864, today passed legisla
tion of an emergency character which
specifically ' provides that Connecticut
national guardsmen who are In feder
al service on the Mexican border may,
If they are qualified electors, vote at
the November election, not only for
federal officers, but for state officers.
Their votes will be collected by two
commissioners to be appointed by
Governor Marcus H. Holcomb.
$100,000 For Relief of Dependents.
Another measure appropriated $100.
000 for relief of the dependents of the
militiamen, should such aid be applied
for, the towns and cities to make dis
bursements under proper safeguards
and the state comptroller to reimburse
for such relief funds.
Legislators Put in a Long Day.
These two measures were the prin
cipal items of business, although some
time was required to set lekislative
machinery in motion, to provide for
engrossment of bills, to authorize pay
ment of mileage for members, chap
lains, doorkeepers and messengers,
this in lieu of all other compensation
and legislative . expenses. According
ly the legislators put in a long day
day final adjournment under direc
tion of Secretary of State Bumes not
coming until after 5 o'clock.
Governor Holcomb personally ap
peared and read his message, upon
which was based the emergency ses
sion. During the day the governor
reeei-ed a telegram from Congress
man E. J. Hill to the effect that a
srrand review of troops would be held
on October by the president at Wash
ington. In explanation of the "votes for
so!dlei'' bill. Representative Peasiey
of Oheshire in the house venture! the
cpinion that the law might be Actual
ly operative, as Connecticut organiza
tions may have returned home by elec
tion day.
Bills Were Debated.
The bills which were passed today
were subject to some debate in com
mittee in both branches, but. they vrcie
adopted as recommended by the com
mittces.
Tho rcornini. session was ro ;essel
at noon until bite in the afternoon,
the interval 'reing embraced by me:a
bers for renewing acaua'ntances.
$5,537.50 For Mileage.
The ilpage bill called for $5,587.50,
whil 600 additional was voted for
exper If incident to the session. The
chief election to the "votes for sol
diers" bill was offered by Mr. Hewes
o? Farmington, who argued that Uie
question of corttitutionality might be
raised, because the legislature was
providing that the soldiers might vote
for stato officers. This objection was
met by a paragraph put into the bill
providing that if any vote for a can
didate should be thrown out, votes for
other candidates shall not be affected.
To the principle of the bill there was
no objection, either in the committee
stage or when it wa3 put upon its
passage. The democrats, in caucis,
had oLed to support the bill and also
to make uo a list of five names from
which the governor might select a
democratic commissioner.
In discussion of the relief bill in the
committee stage, those who favored it
asked that it be so worded that the
giving of relief would be distinctly an
act of the state's recognition of the
services of the soldiers and not an
offering of charity. Representative
Ea.ton of North Haven said that while
$100,000 was appropriated, it was
quite likely that $50,000 would cover
relief disbursements. If more than
$100,000 was needed, the Board of
Control could increase the amount.
A Mirthful Closing.
The final adjournment was preceded
by votes of thanks to presiding offi
cers and clerks; the singing of songs
and remarks by several members who
had acquired reputations as story tell
ers or wits at the 1915 session.
COASTWISE LINES WANT
SAME PRIVILEGES AS RAILROADS
If the Latter Are Permitted to Put in
Effect Higher Tariffs.
New York, Sept. 12. Withdrawal of
the coastwise lines fro mcompetition or
permission to increase their rates
would be the only alternatives if the
New Haven and the Boston and Al
bany Railroads are permitted to put
in effect higher tariffs in place of ex
isting proportional and trans-shipment
rates, according to W. P. Lewis,
general freight agent of the Clyde and
Mallory lines. Testifying here today
at the Interstate Commerce Commis
sion investigation into the proposed
changes, Mr. Levis said an increase
by the railroads would mean an in
crease all along the line.
"We have never considered the con
ditions imposed by the trunk lines up
on us were equitable as to rates," he
said, "and they were arranged in spite
of our protests."
Railroad officials at the hearing ad
mitted that the expenses of the At
lantic Coast steamship lines had risen
in proportion to their own, but they
claimed the issue was not the insuf
ficient rates of the steamship lines, but
only of the railroads.
