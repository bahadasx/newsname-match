Bur Clover Is
Best
Will Serve Excellently In
South as a Winter Cover
Crop.
Washington, I). 0., Sept. 8.?
Bur clover is the cheapest le?
gume that will serve in the
South as a winter, cover crop
anil prevent the washing of
soil. The southern or spotted,
variety is the one best adapted
to conditions over the larger
part of this area. Among the
special advantages of bur cto
ver is the fact that good stands
can often be obtained from
year to year without additional
seeding. When once establish?
ed ou pasture lunds bur clover
will reseed itself indefinitely
provided the plants are allowed
to mature some seed nt least
?Very other year. Its use has
ulso resulted in many instances
in materially increasing the
yield of cotton. Farmers' bul?
letin 003 of the department of
agriculture gives directions for
inoculating the land and sow?
ing the seed and suggests rota
tionB in which bur clover may
be used to advantage.
Hur clover should always be
sown in late summer or fall. In
the cotton states the best time
for seeding is the month of Sep?
tember, but it may be seeded in
.August and seeding as late as
October ofteu give favorable
results oven as far north us
South Carolina. Seeding later
than October, however, are to
bo avoided whenever possible,
us but little fall and winter
growth is usually secured from
mich plantings. When the ecod
is sown in the bur, broadcast?
ing is the only practicable
method. To obtain a full stand
by this method from three to
Rix bushels of seed per acre are
necessary. After sowing a
light harrowing should be giv
on. In the regions, however,
which are well adapted lo bur
clover, it is much more econo?
mical as a rule to begin with a
a light seeding and to depend
in subsequent years on the vol?
unteer crop when this is practic?
able.
In the cotton stntes lack of
inoculation apparently has of?
ten been the cause of failure in
establishing bur clover crops,
' specially when hulled seed was
sown, Usually when seed is
sown in the bur there are
enough bacteria in the dust on
the burs to insure inoculation.
H is desirable, however in
planting bur clover for the first
lime that farmers do not go to
the expense of purchasing a
large quantity of seed, but that
they plant a comparatively
sinall aroa, inoculating the soil
either by tho aoil-transfor meth?
od or, in tho absence of inocu?
lated soil, by the use of puro
cultures. When once a patch of
bur clover has been grown sue
? 'ssfully ou a farm the whole
f:irni can oasily be inoculated
by scattering soil from the
places where tho bur clovor
grew successfully.

TOWN BUYS DUMMY
BRIDGE.
At the regular couni'il meet
ing lam Tuesday, the 5th inst,
the town purchased the part of
the Bast Fifth Street bridge
owned by the Dummy Com?
pany, paying therefore$1,600.00
land canceling taxes and water
rents due from the company
amounting to, approximately,
$286.(K). 'i'bt> price asked was
; ?'. 100.00. Tlie bridge was erect
Iod in 1004 jointly by the town
land Dummy Company at a cost
I for the steel work of' $8,000, of
which the town paid at the
time for the wagon and wnlk
way $2,500 and the Dummy
Company $f>,50o.
Considerable hesitation was
felt by the council in making the
[purchase at this time because
of the ttha?Cial condition of the
town treasury and the action
taken was the result of appre?
hension that the Dummy Com?
pany's part of the bridge might
be sold and removed, a thing
I the council did not want to see
done.
The side owned by the town
jisalO ton bridge, while the
I dummy Bide has a capacity of
I KM) tons and could be lloored
With concrete and still carry
heavy tonagoi
It is still hoped by some that
eventually a trolly line may be
built through the Hap, which
would make the bridge a vain
able link in the line, and this
is thought to be the main rea?
son for the town council taking
action to inaure its stay where
it is.
There being no funds avail?
able at this lime the council
authorized live notes of tho
town to be issued in multiples
of $300 each running i, 2, 3, I
and ."i years respectively at 0
per cent interest payable an?
nually.
Road Work.
Mr. (1. VV. Scott, of Norton,
County .Superintendent of pub
roads, was in town last Friday
and informed us that the grad?
ing of the back valley road,
leading from Minion's store up
the valley to a connection with
the main valley pike was com
pleated, and that the noxt
work will be that of Maca?
damizing about 1,000 feet of
road at Cadet that the county
had agreed to lo some time ago.
During the past spring anil
summer the following roads in
tho Richmond Magisterial Dis?
trict have been re-surfaced with
a llrst class grade of asphalt,
and they aro now in the best
of condition: From Appala
chia to Stonega; from Appala
lachia to Black wood; from Ap?
palachian to luman; from Ap
palachia to Big Stone Gap, anil
from the mouth of Pigeon Creek
to Imboden.
Tin- work of resurfacing the
road from Big Stone Gap up the
valley to Norton will be com?
menced within tho next ten
days. This road was surfaced
with Tarvy last year, which
proved very unsatisfactory, ami
the district will now give it a
coat of asphalt, which will
make it one of the smoothest
ami prettiest roads in the coun?
