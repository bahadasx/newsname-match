RARE MUSICAL TREAT
Several Fine Artists Give Their Ser
vices For Concert at Grace Church
For War Relief Fund.
A large audience heard the excep
tionally fine concert for the benefit of
the war relief fund held at the Grace
Methodist Episcopal church, Monday
evening. A most pleasing program
was carried out and the music lovers
who attended the concert heard many
numbers delightfully rendered.
The vocal solos by Miss Bertha W.
Swift, soprano, and Mrs. G. C. Howes,
contralto called forth encores, while
the duet rendered by them was a
blending of two delightful voices.
Miss Helen Boynton showed tech
nique and a masterful knowledge of
the violin in her violin solos. Hugh
Mackinnon and Miss Alice Nichols at
the organ, and piano, were able ac
companists to the vocalists, and also
in the Quartet for violin, piano, 'cello
and organ demonstrated their capa
bilities. Whitney Landon brought the full
est tone qualities from the 'cello in
the accompaniments, and in the in
strumental quartet.
The program was carried out prac
tically as arranged and each of the
entertainers weer artists in the ren
dition or the aimcuit passages. Thanks
to those who kindly gave their ser
vices this entertainment, the proceeds
of which went to a worthy cause, was
a decided success financially as well
as being one of the musical treats of
the year In St. Johnsbury.

Burlington, Sept. 12. Returns from 141 election precincts out of
284 in the state up to an early hour this morning showed that Carrol S.
Page had easily won the nomination for United States senator from
Vermont to succeed himself. Sen. Page faced a campaign of money
and bitterness and a three-cornered fight and polled a vote nearly twice
as large as his opponents combined. Allen M. Fletcher, who waged
the chief campaign against Sen. Page, polled a slightly larger vote
than Gov. C. "W. Gates, the other candidate.
The real fight of Vermont's first state-wide primaries came in the
contest for lieutenant governor where the same precincts gave Roger
Hurlburd 7721 and John W. Weeks 7543.
The contest for the state auditorship developed another close result
between Cave and Gates, the latter having the better of the precincts
which were reported by a vote of 7847 to 6445.
Horace F. Graham of Craftsbury was nominated for governor by
the republicans without opposition, as was "William B. Mayo of North
field by the democrats.
CALEDONIA COUNTY CONTESTS
With two towns missing in Caledonia county Morse and Ricker
were shown to have been nominated for the state senate. The vote
standing with Peacham and Stannard missing is as follows: Morse
1111, Ricker 1408, and Russell 812. The same towns gave James A.
Campbell 1188, and Norton 848 for state's attorney.
The republicans renamed Sheriff W. H. Worthern of St. Johns
bury for that office without party opposition as did the democrats in
the case of the candidacy of John Buckley of Wheelock.
Walter P. Smith registered a good vote in his unopposed campaign
for judge of probate.

Howe Entertains Bar.
The Caledonia county bar to the
number of 33, were the guests ot
Judge Harland B. Howe on an outing
to the White Mountains Saturday aft
ernoon which included a banquet at
the Mt. Washington House in the eve
ning. The party left St. Johnsbury at
1.30 p. m., Saturday in a number of
automobiles, and after stopping at
points of interest on the way, arrived
at the Mountain .House late in the aft
ernoon. The party sat down to the
banquet provided by the host soor.
atfer 7 o'clock, after which reminis
cent speeches were made by member?
of the bar. The party returned late
in the evening. '
R. B. Goodale of Cornish, N. H.,
spent last week with his sister, Mrs.
E. M. Forrest. This was their first
meeting in 30 years.
It was nearly midnight when the
tellers at the local polling place had
completed the count of votes follow
ing the turn of the ballot box at the
first Vermont primary election, Tues
day night. The delay in the counting
was due mostly to misunderstanding
as to marking ballots on the part of
the voters. About 35 ballots were
thrown out on the county vote on ac
count of defective marking, and also
some on the state ticket, but these
were not so many. Many ballots
were thrown out in cases where there
were three names for a county office
and two were to be elected out of the
three. In many of these instances
the entire three names would have a
cross opposite them. On some of
these ballots it was possible to save
portions of the names where It
was unmistakable that the voter
meant to vote a straight ticket, while
on others it was necessary to throw
out the entire ballot.
These mistakes made it more diffl-i
cut for the tellers as the ballots were
gone over with more care and many
more times. The final count was
completed about 11.30.

worked its way underneath the waste
and threatened to be serious, but was
finally controlled with the sprinklers
at the shops, without the aid of the
