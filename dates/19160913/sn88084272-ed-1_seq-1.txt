HUGHES ASSERTS
Maine Election is Conclusive
Proof, Declares the Re
publican Nominee.
Plattsbur?. N. T.. SepL 13. The re
sult of the Maine election proves the
Republican party is reuinited, said
Charles E. Hughes. Republican candi
date for president in the last speech
of his first presidential tour Tuesday
night. He addressed a crowded houss
which applauded him repeatedly.
"I come to you," Mr. Hughes said,
"as the spokesman of a reunited Re
nublican nartv. "We have said it was
reunited, we have devoutly hoped It
was reunited. .ov Jiatne proves tnai
it is reunited. Whoever was skepti
cal about that before must hide his
cynicism now. tVe shall abandon no
efforts. We shall not change our.plans
or aims, but we shall go forward with
renewed confidence because the old
state in the northeast corner has spok
en in no uncertain way."
Assails Democratic Extravagance.
He assailed the Wilson administra
tion for failure to reduce the cost of
living, for extravagance, for failure to
protect American lives and rights
abroad, and for failure to "live up to
its promise to observe the merit sys
tem. The nominee emphasized pre
vious declaratins that the campaign
was a "good natured" one.
"Our friends on the other side said
that the Republican party was respon
sible for the high cost of living," he
said. They have been In power for
some time and I do not see that the
high cost of living has been reduced.
It was said they would dispose of many ,
useless officers. The abolition of use
less offices has not been quite so ap
parent as appointment of useless offi
cers." Praiara Plattabanr Camp.
Earlier in the day the nominee visit
ed the military training camp here, re
maining for dinner with MaJ. Gen.
Leonard Wood. Mr. Hughes praised
the camp in his speech.
"It ifr a training school In democ
racy." he said. 'It is a discipline that
knits men together in wholesome com
radeship. "It is preparedness, not only mili
tary bnt civil and moral.
'That is the spirit we must have in
this country if America is to go for
ward, if America indeed is to hold her
place among the nations in the trouble
some days of the 20th century.
Wants Store Training Camps.
T desire to see these camps main
tained in various parts of our land
and men in constantly increasing num
bers seeking the benefit of the train
ing and discipline T believe that our
citizen reserve should be trained under
federal authority I think it was a
great mistake to abandon the plan that
was first formulated with that end
in view"

The doctor was discussing dementia

Guild believed that tM man of taleat

MULE ASLEEP; GIRL VETERINARY
Atlanta. Ga., Sept 13 Miss Ruth
Corker, 15 years old. of Ornowood Park,
a suburb of Atlanta, is the only girl
veterinary surgeon in the world.
Treating mules for lockjaw or sew
ing up huge cuts in horses' legs is
child's play for this girl, who learned
her profession through her father and
grandfather, both of whom are veteri
nary surgeons. She has a large num
ber of animal patients.
"It takes a barrel of chloroform to
put a mule to sleep," said Miss Corker.
So I rope them down, inject cocaine
locally and operate."
This is a new and entirely unex
plored field for women. There are
women physicians who specialize on
human patients, but so far as is known
this little girl is the only feminine
"horse doctor" in the world.

Shanghai. China. Sept 13. Tans
Shao-yi. who was the first premier un
der the Chinese republic, but incurred
the displeasure of Yuan Shi-kai and
had been out of favor for a period or
four years, has again loomed big in
Chinese affairs and is the center of
the crowd of ultra republicans in
Shanghai who are endeavoring to di
rect the reorganization of the repub
lic Tang Shao-yi was educated in
America, and became well known in
official circles there when he was sent
to Washington in 190S to thank the
United States government for return
ing to China the portion of the Boxer
indemnity money which exceeded the
actual losses suffered by American
citizens through the Boxer rebellion.
tVu Tins Fans "Active.
Associated with Tang Shao-yi in the
present effort to direct the reorganiza
tion of the Chinese government alon?
more democratic lines are Dr. Wu
Ting-fang, former minister to the
United States. Dr. Sun Yat-Sen, the
first provisional president of the Chi
nese republic, and many other Chinese
of International reputation.
Although Tang Shao-yi was desig
nated minister of foreign affairs in
the compromise cabinet formed by pre
mier Tuan Chi-Jui after the death of
president Yuan Shi-kai. he has not yet
gone to Pekin to assume his duties
preferring to remain In conference
with his associates at Shanghai until
his cabinet appoinment shall have been
ratified by the parliament reassembled
under the terms of the Nanking pro
visional constitution proclaimed by
president Li Yuan-hung to be the (
i iuii u. x uaii-uuu iu w iu3
' legal constitution of China pending the
drafting of a permanent constitution
under the direction et parliament.
-T Hopefnl for China.
Mr. Tang Sho-yl discussed the fu
ture of China very optimistically. "I
am very hopeful concerning the out
come of the present crisis." he said. "I
believe recent disaster has taught
Chinese leaders a valuable lesson. It
has been demonstrated that the Chi
nese are earnest about wanting a re
public, and will not tolerate leaders
who desire to thwart the public will
and direct affairs to suit their personal
ambition.
Emprron Rnled By Mrensrth.
"China does not want a continuation
of government similar to that main
tained under the Manchu emperors.
They retained their position through
military strength and through that
alone. By sending northern troops
into all the southern provinces they
dominated the south, but never won
the loyalty and affection of southern
ers. It has always been very offensive
to the south to nave troops quarterea
US" Vtfv"?"."' ?'a,T !
and were really foreigners to the
south
"Under the republic the same tactics
were followed. Soldiers from the
provinces north of the Tang-tse were
quartered upon the southern provinces,
just as in the Manchu days: It was a
continuation of the old military domi
nation. This system will not work.
Southern province will not submit
longer to any such indignity, and there
wil never be any peace in China until
new methods are adopted I think the
time has come when leaders in all sec
tions realize this, and expect to see
parliament allowed a free hand to cor
rec the old abuses."

to End Transportation
Strike is Failure.
New Tork. Sept 13. Efforts of may
or J. P. Mitchel and the public service
commission to terminate the street
railway strike, which threatened to
bring on a sympathetic strike tying op
many of the city's industries and
throwing many thousands out of work,
failed today when the Interborough
Rapid Transit company refused to sub
mit the matters at issue to arbitration.
The Interborough acted also for the
"green car" operating company.
The rejection presented by Richard R.
Rogers, general counsel for the two
companies, read:
"The Interborough Rapid Transit
company respectfully represents to the
commission that it cannot arbitrate its
rights to enter into agreements with
10.30S of its employes out of a total of
11. SM. when the employes who have
signed are content with those agree
ments and are endeavoring to carry
them ont in good faith."
Contract Are Grievance.
The agreements referred to are the
"master and servant" contracts, which
bind the men not to ask for wage In
creases or betterment of working con
ditions for two years. The distribution
of the contracts among the interbor
ough and "green car" employes forced
the strike, union leaders claim.

companies, the strikers, through Win.
