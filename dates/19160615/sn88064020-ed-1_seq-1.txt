is canal would carry said water by gra

es level of the main canal, due to the

very largely interested in this lower

SLevee Board to help the city. and
adsee that you get two canals and a

Sno levee, and this wooded strip men-i
Stioned, will be worth the cost of
cutting down its trees. The object
le.son whi.ll the reclanatiot of thii
nile-deep strip will furnish, wvill
probably induce another mile strip
to be taken in, when this entire
waooded section will possibly, In the
course of time, le thus trancsformeed
from a nenace into an asset. The
sensible business men constituting
the Htero drainage company know
that what is outlined in this article
Is eminently the proper thing for
the city authorities, the Levee Board
and the owners of the cleared lands
adjacent to the big government in
terests, to do, and that nothing is
farther from their purpose than to
hamper the Htero project in any way
whatever, it being a self-evident
proposition that nothing would more
largely and more quickly add to the
value of these front lands, than the
development of those in the rear.
The big factories, warehouse, etc..
that will locate on this silde, just as
soon as the river bridge will bring
the Belt Railroad across, will abso
lltely require protection from the
rear inundation of this section, which
would interfere with railroad con
nections traversing it, and there is
no other way to prevent these ever
recurring disasters which will be
come aggravated as the river goes
higher, except through the instru
mentality of a substantial levee as
close to the field line as is practi
cable. The Mayor is to be congrat
ulated upon his decision which was
as wise as it was timely and which
will, beyond doubt, result in satis
tying the government Interests men
tioned, while extending simple Jue
tice to our own tax-payers.
