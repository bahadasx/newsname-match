HUGHES THE NOMINEE
y.:
At the Republican National Conven
tion. Roosevelt Declines the
Bull Moose Nomination.
It is Hughes and Fairbanks. The
republican national convention at
Chicago stampeded to Hughes last
Saturday, Hughes receiving a total of
S»49% votes, Rooseveit 18^, Lodge
7, DuPont 5, Weeks 3 and LaFollette
3. Charles W. Fairbanks, of Indi
ana, was nominated for vice presi
dent. A few minutes later the Bull
Moose convention nominated Roose
velt, but were dumbfounded when
Roosevelt telephoned declining the
nomination, saying he was out of
politics. There was gnashing of
teeth and wailing galore, the Moos
ers claiming they had been thrown
down by treachery. They nominated
John M. Parker, of New Orleans, for
vice president, and left the matter of
nominating a candidate for president
in the hands of the national commit
tee. Leaders of the Moosers declare
they will not allow their party to
die, and will put another candidate in
the field in case Roosevelt does not
reconsider his declination, as it was
a conditional one. Teddy carried out
his plans of rule or ruin, and when
he failed to force the republican con
vention to nominate him, he sulks,
and don't want the Moose nomina
tion.
Only three ballots were taken at
the republican convention for presi
dent. The following is the result of
the first two ballots:
1st 2nd
Hughes 253 328
Weeks 105 79
Root 103 98%

Caused Grief to Autoists.
The railroad crossing three miles
north of Leon caused considerable
grief the past week to several auto
ists. A big spike had become loosen
ed in the planking and stood half
out of the plank and several autoists
ruined tires by striking it. A car
driven by Miss Irene Buchanan, of
Alpena, Michigan, enroute to Kan
sas, struck the spike Sunday after
noon and two casings and tubes were
ripped open. Ed C. Smith who lives
near brought the parties to Leon af
ter new casings, and it is probable
that the railroad will be called upon
to settle for the damage.
Wilson Will Be Nominated Saturday.
The democratic national conven
tion assembled at St. Louis yesterday
and the result is a foregone conclu
sion. The program is not to nomi
nate until Saturday, and then Presi
dent Woodrow Wilson will be re
nominated by acclamation, and it is
more than liitely that vice president
Marshall will also be renominated.
There is absolute harmony in the
democratic ranks, no contests, no bit
ter feeling, and everybody is embued
with the idea tfciat President Wilson
will be re-elected in November.

man so popular with his patrons and
will at all times give the farmers a
square deal for their poultry and
produce. Mr. Coleman has built up a
fine business, but desired to sell out
to engage in ministerial work.

Brethren Church.
Rev. G. T. Ronk, who has been
pastor of the new Brethren church in
this city since its completion, expects

The Decatur County Sunday School
Convention was Largely Attend
ed and Very Enthusiastic.
The Decatur County Sunday School
convention which was held last Tues
day and Wednesday at the Methodist
church was a success in every way.
The weather and roads were good
and the attendance at the sessions
was excellent. Thirty-seven dele
gates enrolled, nine superintendents
and ten pastors. Mr. Walter Hutton,
the state worker from Des Moines,
was present and in no small manner
contributed to the success of the
convention. His splendid addresses
were much appreciated by the dele
gates and others who attended.
Mr. L. E. Gibson of Des Moines,
was present with a superb collection
of pictures. He gave several instruc
tive lectures on the use of pictures in
the Sunday school. His interpreta

Other out-of-county visitors were
Rev. James Gribble and his wife, Di.
Florence Gribble, missionaries
Africa, home on furlough, ur. Grib
ble gave a short address on Wednes

solved.
The county secretary repoi
showed a marked improvement over

UIYEK BOTTOM FAKMEHS TALK
DHAIXAGE CHANXEL FOIl
WELDON.
A Petition Out for the Establishment
of a Drainage Channel.
Farmers who own farms on the
fertile bottoms bordering Weldon
River over in Morgan and Garden
Grove townships in Decatur county,
have, been discussing the feasibility
of a drainage channel to prevent the
destruction of their crops by over
flows and the matter has recently
assumed a definite form by the pre
sentation of a petition to the board
of supervisors of Decatur county for
the establishment of a drainage dis
trict under the provisions of the Iowa
law, beginning at a point northwest
of Garden Grove on the north and ex
tending to tne Iowa and Missouri line
on the south. The law provides that
such a district can only be establish
ed by a petition signed by two-thirds
of the voters and owners of land sub
ject to overflow in the contemplated
district and only such lands to be
taxed to pay the cost of constructing
the drainage channel, the work to be
done bv the county and the tax regu
lated by installments extending over
a number of years. It is estimated
that such a channel will cost from
to $6 per acre on such lands as are
subject to overflow. Such lands as
will be benefitted by the drainage
channel are the richest and most
productive corn lands of tliis section
and before many years shall have
elapsed, the only lands on which corn
can be profitably grown. All of the
crops on these lands were de
stroyed by overflows last season.
When every acre of good corn would
have been worth from $25 to $35 ii
could have been saved by a drainage
channel, thus netting the farmer in
one season more than enough to pay
his total portion of the cost of a
drainage channel. The first planting
of corn lias been destroyed this
spring by overflows in May and a
full crop, even if the second planting
now in progress should escape the
fate of the first, cannot now be rea
sonably expected. Such a drainage
channel is now in course of construc
tion on Thompson river in the vicin
itv of Cainesville and others have
been in successful operation for years
on the Skunk river in Mahaska coun
ty, Iowa, and on Chariton rtver east
of Centerville and the farmers bene
fitted by the enterprise say they have
repaid themselves hundreds of times
for all the drainage channel cost
them. These enterprises are no long
er experiments and are without doubt
the most certain and profitable in
vestments the owner of a bottom
farm can make. Mercer county farm
ers along Weldon river are also deep
ly interested in the success of the con
templated drainage channel in Iowa
and declare they will be ready to ex
tend the channel through their terri
tory as soon as it is authorized to the
state line.—Lineville Tribune.

John Barryinore in "Are You A Ma
son?" Friday, and Mi^ry Pickford
in "Little Pal" Monday.
The special feature play at the Idle
Hour theatre on Friday of this week
is the famous actor John Barrymore,
in the great laugh triumph "Are You
A Mason?" a shriekingly funny farce.
In "Are You A Mason?" Mr. Bar
rymore portrays the character of
Frank Perry, a dashing young mar
ried man of exuberant spirits and
vivid imagination. When his wife
announces that her chief desire in
life is to have him become a Mason,
Perry grasps the opportunity it af
fords for staying out several nights,
explaining his numerous absences
from home by the logical statement
that he is spending his evenings at
the Masonic lodge, undergoing the
ordeals of initiation.
One night wifey delightfully an
nounces that her father, Grand Mas
ter of the iwasons, is coming to visit
them. Perry's agonized efforts to
keep his father-in-law from discov
ering his deception, and the fearful
tangles in which he becomes involved
thereby, culminating in a situation
which is one of the funniest climax
es ever conceived, furnish the humor
of the farce, which is further height
ened by the fact that the "grand
master" has also deceived his family,
is not a Mason, and is constantly
manufacturing other deceptions to
safeguard his first falsehood.
How he is finally caught and cor
nered by his clever son-in-law, who
emerges victoriously from the chaos
he has created, ends the comedy in
a roaring laughable manner.
Next Monday, the popular favorite,
Mary Pickford, will appear in one of
her greatest successes, "Little Pal."
"Little Pal" provides Mary Pick
ford, the unrivaled favorite of the
screen, with one of the most unique
roles in which she has ever been
presented. The photoplay is one of
primitive emotions and primal pas
sions, and evidences a hitherto un
suspected aspect of Mary Pickford's
astounding versality. Unfamiliar
with the customs of modernity and
remote from all the influences wfeich
have fashioned our present civiliza
tion, "Little Pal" recognizes no other
force than the dominant love which
develops within her for the one man
who has practiced justice toward her.
Through a series of thrilling sacri
fices she proves her loyalty and devo
tion to him, and when she has at last
secured his happiness requests no
other reward from him or fate.
Mary Pickford invests this extra
ordinary characterization with all the
power and charm for which she is
universally celebrated:
Matinees at a o'clock, first even
ing shows at 7:15. Price i0 and 1^
cents.

River and is loved by all who meet
and know her and she is highly re
