Notes From Topeka
; This week in Topeka has been
one of the busy weeks of the
CapitaL . Tuesday merchants
from aU over the state began to
gather at Topeka and for two or
'three days all kindsof amuse
ments were put on for their en
tertainment. Day by day the
bulletin board in front of the
Journal office was well patron
ized everyone anxious to get the
latest news from the Chicago
conventions. Saturday although
it was raining a steady down
pour crowds were there watch
ing for the latest news, and when
the news of the nominations of
Roosevelt and Hughes were ah
nounced, the faces of the crowds
were truly living pictures, some
more a pleasant, satisfied look,
others with seemingly I don't
. care a , others you could
discern wern't altogether satis
fied. , .
" Geo. B. Allen was registered
at one of the leading hotels sev
eral days during the week.
We were at the Department
Commanders office where we
found" the Commander always
' busy at his desk or entertaining
visitors. When Kansans visit
Topeka one of the places that is
of great interest is Memorial
' Hall. The new Commander is
always ready to show visitors ev
ery courtesy at bis command,
and his old comrades gather at
his office in great numbers. He
delivers the address on flag day
at Iola the 14th. His speaking
dates are not only numerous but
extend over most of the state.
Capt. D. L Sweeney the A. A.
G. takes to his job like a duck to
water, hence the department is
putting out lots of work.
W. E. Davis and George W.
Wiley are other, Meade county
1 contingents here at Topeka that
have a just share of popularity.
Of course all Kansas rejoices
that the great southwest at last
' got a good soaking rain and by
the way no county in Kansas is
'. praised by those who are so for
tunate as to have had the good
fortune to have visited it of late
years more than good old Meade
county and the people of Meade
need have no fear that the G. A.
R.'Dept. Commander ever neg
lects an opportunity to advertise
its advantages one would think
be was in the real estate business'
' instead of being the head of the
Grand Army of Kansas. ,
On Wednesday of this week
Associate Justice Silas Porter of
the Supreme Court read a paper
on the life of ex-Associate Justice
"Benson who died several months
. ; ago in the Supreme Court. It
't was a scholarly eulogy on a wor
' thy man and was heard by many
'- members of the Kansas bar and
i friends of Judge Benson.
Change In Trains

made in the time of Rock Island

To Auto Owners
During the past year a very
large num-ber of. automobiles
have been stolen. Organized
gangs make a specialty of steal
ing cars in this and surrounding
states. It is almost unbelievable
the number of cars stolen and
never recovered. Something
must be done to stop this crime.
Heretofore no index of the en
gine numbers has been kept by
this department, as the law does
not require it. For this reason
it was impossible to find the en
gine number unless either the
name of the owner of the car or
the license number were known.
The office is now keeping a card
index to all cars registered by
their engine numbers, and tak
ing other steps to prevent the
theft of machines and to assist
the officers of the law in its en
forcement. You can greatly assist this de
partment by seeing that we have
your correct engine number and
description of your car, and by
notifying this office promptly
should your par be sold or stolen;
also by promptly notifying us oi
any information or suspicious
you may' have concerning the
theft of any car or of any car
thief. Any information of this
kind will be treated as strictly
confidential.
The automobile registration
law has now . been in operation
four -years. Time and oppor
tunity have been given to dis
cover its weak points, and to sug
gest needed changes in its pro
visions. The law has met with
general favor from owners-of
machines, although a few have
objected to any, law. whatever
governing the operation and
registeration of automobiles.
The number of cars is increas
ing so rapidly, not only in Kan
sas but all over the country, that
in my judgment it is not likely
that any state, and especially
Kansas, will ever abandon reg
istration. If, as I believe, we are to con
tinue to have an automobile reg
istration law, we ought to have
the very best that experience
can suggest and that wisdom can
deyise. Our present law has
worked pretty well, but experi
ence has proven that it has a few
weak places that .ought to be
strengthened. I expect to re
commend to the next legislature
some amendments to this law,
and am asking you, as an auto
mobile owner and therefore an
interested party, for any sug
gestions you may have to offer
relative to needed changes in
the law.
During the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1916, almost 90,000 auto
mobiles were registered. This
number will probably be increas
ed to more than 100,000 during
the present fiscal year. The
money thus derived, if properly
expended, will be oi.vast bene
fit to the highways of the state,
and I hope to have your hearty
cooperation in an effort to see
that these funds are properly
and judiciously expended on the
roads as the law intends.
Yours very respectfully,
J. T. Botkifl,
' - Secretary of State.

Sweet To Lansing
Archie Sweet passed through
Dodge City on Santa Fee train
No. 6 this morning on his way
to the Kansas penitentiary at
Lansing to begin bis life sentence
for the murder of Nellie Byers.
Sweet was sentenced by Judge
Downer on Saturday afternoon.
His attorney, Ernest D. Martin
of Kansas City, first planned to
prepare a n elaborate appeal in
support of bis motion for a new
trial. He changed bis mind, bow
ever, and presented his motion
to Judge Downer late in the af
ternoon. It was overruled and
immediately afterward Sweet
was called in and sentenced.
Sheriff John McCarter did not
announce when he would take
Sweet away and it was not known
in Syracuse that Sweet was gone
until this morning when it was
found that Sweet bad been re
moved during the night and put
en board No. 6. Sweet gave out
declared his innocence. Earl
Ross, clerk of the court at Syra
cuse, said over the telephone to
day that a subscription . was be
ing taken by some people to pay
the expense of an appeal to the
supreme court for Sweet. The
socialist party, which was open
ly intimated during the trial was
financing bis defense, is expect
ed to contribute to the appeal
fund. Guy Clayton, court re
porter, and Judge Downer pass
ed through Dodge City yester
day enroute to Liberal to open
court, and Mr. Clayton said he
had been asked the cost of tran
scribing the evidence and that it
was represented to him that the
appeal would be prepared at
once. That there was insuf
ficient evidence to convict prob
ably will be the ground on which
the appeal is taken. Dodge City
Globe, June 6.
Wednesday evening a number
of relatives and friends of Mrs.
Robt. Brannan gathered at her
home and celebrated her birth
day anniversary. Refreshments
were served and after wishing
her many more happy birthdays,
the guests returned to their var
ious homes,
