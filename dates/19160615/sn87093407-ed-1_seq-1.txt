SEATTLE sells its surplus water to various dis
tricts outside of the city.
People in these districts have been glad to pay
15 cents a cubic foot for all water they consumed.
Small users within the city limits pay six cents a
cubic foot.
The revenue received annually by the city for
the surplus water sales amounts to f 10,500.
Now Corporation Counaol Caldwell hae coma along with an

the way now is open for anybody to start a law

Evidence In the hands of ad

Twenty nine cases of bottled

It was learned Thursday, Into

They were part of th* acow
load of beer consigned from
Ban Francisco, via Seattle, to
Ketchikan, Alaska, which the
police seized off Harbor Island
on April 11.
Mayor 0111 helped dump 960
cases Into the bay.
Thirty-two oasea were ordered
held, so that the charge against W.

ment, might he prosecuted.
When the rase came to trial

men were unable to produce more

Another law, passed later, gave the city the right to sell It*
surplus water, but this law was repealed In 1915, so that the city
has nothing now upon which to bale its fight for the reasonable
and Just right to ssll water to outside communltlee except th«
statute upon which the supreme court has made It EJUSDEM
CENERIB ruling.
Thers are two ways In which the city can gain this right.
One lies In prevailing upon the supreme court to reopen the
cass of Farwell vs. Seattle, and hear new arguments upon the
meaning of the phrase, "and any other persons."
The other lies In having the next legislature pass a law giv
ing the city the power.
Application has been made to the supreme
court by interested parties living outside the city
for a reopening of the Farwell case.
Thus far, however, the supreme court has not
deigned to notice the application.
It is standing pat on the ejusdem generis.

STEAMER BEAR HITS
ROCKS; FIVE BODIES
ARE WASHED ASHORE
PORTLAND, June 15.—Twenty-three Uvea
are believed to have been lost when the liner Bear
en route from Portland to San Francisco, ran
•(round in the fog last night on the jagged rocks
near Cape Mendocino, in northern California.
Offiier* of the San Francisco & Portland S. S. Co., own
ers of the Hear, announced today that five bodies had been
washed ashore at C ape Mendocino.
Two of the five bodies have been identified as those of
Herman Rose, butcher; and F. Rossi, second cook.
All lifeboats of the Bear, which had 120 passengers and
R2 members of the crew aboard, have been picked up except
one.
That one contained 20 person*, it is thought.
Fourteen lifeboats, it is said, started from the Bear. The
naval training station radio at Verba Buena, in San Francisco ,
bay, received a message from Eureka saying the battleship
Oregon reported all passengers except those in two missing
boats aboard the Blunt's reef lightship.
One hundred and thirty survivors are either at Eureka
or en route, and 2V have readied Capetown, a total of 159
saved.
If the total of 182 is corrcct this leaves 23 unaccounted
Captain I<ouls Nopander and
three sallora are aUll aboard the
wreck. whl?h la being heavily
pounded by the great sea* crash
ing over the reef.
When the passengers and crew
were taking to the boats at mid
night, v'apt. Nopander refused to
leave his bridge.
Three men decided to remain
with him.
Plans for their rescue are being
made.
The Hear Is believed a total loss
Fourt' en lifeboats left tbe
Hear when it crashed upon Blunts
Keef last night. Nine reached th?
lightship at Blunts Reef, landing
60 persons, who wore later trans
ferred to the tug Relief and the
steamer Grace Dollar The Relief
reached Eureka with Its survivors
at noon.
Two lifeboats were picked up by
the Relief.
Two other lifeboats passed safe
ly thru the surf and made u land
Ing near the mouth of Hear river.
Steaming thru a thick fog last
night, the llenr drove Into a nest
of Jagg«*d rocks thrustlnK Into the
sen near Cape Mendocino. The
bow stuck fast, while the stern
floated In deep water.
A swell threatened to lift the
wreck off the rocks and sink It
while, water rushed Into the for
ward compartments.
With the shock and crash passen
ger* rmn on deck from their state
rooms.
Flashes Call for Help
Capt. Ij. M No|mnder flashed a
radio call for help, as the leaks had
not yet put his dynamo out of com
mission. then ordered out the life
boats.
In response to the S. O. S„ the
Oregon, steaming south, hurried to
the rescue
The call nlfo was picked up by
the Orare l>ollnr. Feeling their
way thru the fog. the two ships
neared the wreck after midnight,
the Oregon firing light guns from
time to time as a guide to the Grace
Hollar.
The llear was en route from Port
land to San Francisco. It would
have arrived In San Francisco this
morning and proceeded on to Loa
Angeles, after a stop of several
hours.
Among the passengers were many
Knights Templar on their way to
