J publican Nominee
fll 'The following editorial from the
H Chicago Tribune, a hitherto ProgreB-
B give paper, bIzcs up tho Chicago con-
IHJ ventlon In the following terms that
jfti should strike a responsive cord in
IJhj tho heart of every loyal and truo
J.l Republican:
m ,
m THE NOMINATIONS
I
,il Tho nomination of JubUco Hughes
Jl a9 tho Republican candidate 'or
', president was a sound one. Justlco
Hughes' declaration In acceptance
I makes it a brilliant one. The letter
Is a splendid call to arms. It will
send a thrill through the notion. It
rings with passionate sincerity and
radiates tho power of aroused Amer
icanism. In his caso the convention could
solect but could not make the candl
date. What Justlco Hughes says
determines tho character and fore
shadows tho outcome of the cam
paign. It seems to us that no candidate'
for president in fifty years lias had
such opportunity. No time In fifty
years has the nation had such need.
If It was feared that Justice
Hughes campaign would Begin with
less enthusiasm and confidence than
one under the leadership or Colonel
Roosevelt, his accoptanco will do
much to remove that fear. It seems
probablo now that an Inspiring cam
paign under a formidable leader Is
before' lis. Ho begins, too, with 'the
ij advantage that If there was less In--
tensity of conviction for him there
I was less Intensity against him.
Where persuasion must bo used to
demonstrate how dangerous a con
tinuation of tho present government
would be to tho country there will
be less stubborn resistance to per
suasion of prejudice Tho voter who
was bound to bo disheartened or dis
gusted by any other nomination than
that of noosevelt can be won. Tho
causo is good; the candldato Is not
only worthy, he gives promlso of In
spiring leadership.
Tho Republican who hated Roose
velt will not have to bo persuaded
out of his violence and away from
his prejudice.
The Progressives have nominated
Roosovolt. It Is for Colonel Roose
velt to consider what tho effect of
this nomination may have upon the
country.
If ho runs ha may defeat Hughes.
Ho then will give us Wilson and It
will be a poisoned gift straight from
his hands to the nation.
Wilson Is everything Roosevelt has
described him to bo. He moans every
damaging thing to tho country Roose
velt says he does. Ho is tho exact
national danger that Roosevelt con
demns. II ho continues In power
ho will bo Roosevelt's gift to tho
nation.
If tho Republican convention bad
made an unfit nomination tho Pro
gressives would have had oxcuso to
reject It, There surely can bo no
person bo pcrvcrso as to. maintain
that tho nomination of Hughes Is
unworthy of tho Republican party.
There may bo Intense conviction
that tho party Ignored Us best op
portunity and slighted Us greatest
man, but that docs not condomn tho
character of tho man selected.
J Tho nomination of Roosevelt by
the Republican convention, constitut
ed as it was, plainly was Impossible,
much as citizens might liopo for tho
Impossible to happen,
k Tho only way It could havo been
M made possible was by a campaign
fljfl for control of tho convention when
flB the peoplo were, selecting tho delo
fla gates. That campaign was not
HJ niado. It could not bo made unloss
Hi Colonel Hoosovclt made It and lie
M did not.
H Now all that Roosovelt and tho
HJ Progressives can do la to glvu Wood-
row Wilson another term and the
HJ United States another term of Wood-
low Wilson,
HB Justlco HughoB' letter of . nccopt
HH anco should riiako that an Impossl-
blllty.

INTERESTING SIDELIGHTS
ON BIG CONVENTION AS
SEEN BY MR. BULLEN
Senator Depew of New York a Great
Orator Other Distinguished Nation
al Characters Took Leading Part
Local ProgressivesTo Be Congratulated.
Herschel Mullen, who with Mrs.
Bullen returned Monday evening
from an eastern trip, attended the
Republican and Progresslvo Conven
tions whllo at Chicago, and upon
these two Important events gives out
the following:
Tho conventions, nslde from being
extremely Important, wero Interest
ing and entertaining. The great Co
liseum, with a Beating capacity of
over 12,000 was packed to tho limit
with enthusiastic and loyal support
ers of tho Republican party, whllo
tho Auditorium, with much less seat
ing capacity, was llkowlse Illlod to
overflowing with loyal and demon
strative supporters of tho Progress
ive party
There was an appreciative oppor
tunity to sco tho great leaders of
both parties and listen to an ox
chango of views concerning the need
and welfare of tho nation. Now
York's governor was thero claiming
tho nominee of tho convention for
tho Emplro Stato. Ohio's governor,
oiio of the finest orators in tho land,
pronounced Ohio aB tho "Mother of
Presidents," nnd claimed eloquent re
cognition for her native son. Former
Senator W. Murray Crane, support
ing tho candidacy of Senator Weeks
of Massachusetts was there' The
much advertised Senator Penroso of
Pcnnsylvonla, William Barnes, socall
ed political boss of Now York, Sen
ator Lawrcnco Y. Sherman, Illinois
native son candidate. Uncle Joe Can
non, former Sen. Chauncoy M. De
pew of Now York aim a score of oth
ers were thero. In the Press Gallory
omong. tho most distinguished was
tho Hon. William Jennings Bryan.
During one,, of tho stampedes tho
pres proceeded to organlzo and Inas
much as tho Republicans, Progress
hes and Democrats had made ar
rangements for tho nomination of
candidates, tho press artists nomin
ated tho Hon. William Jennings
rtryan to run on n fourth ticket call
ed tlie Prohibition ticket. To this
Mr. Bryan gave his conventional
smllo and accepted tho honor by
drinking a grapo Julco cocktail thru
a straw. When asked for a speech
ho simply smiled again nnd contin
ued pulling at tho grapo Julco thru
tho far end of tho straw.
Whllo waiting for tho Committee
en Platform, tho chairman called
former Senator Depew of New York
to the platform. Mr. Dcpow although
moro than eighty years of agv, talked
with a powerful volco so that ha
could bo heard all over tho hall. Ho
spnko of tho days of Blaine and
Garfield and reminded tho crowd
that ho had been talking for tho Re
publican party for sixty years. Sin
cere applause greeted tho powerful
old man. In touching up President
Wilson lie told how General Seward
hod dealt with Mexico. How Sowonl
said "Get out" and then added "Sher
idan is on tho border," ond captlvat
pd tho great throng by adding "you
could havo ployed checkers on their
coat toils, they got out so fast." Ho
played no favorites; ho told how Gro
vor Cloveland talked to England In
connection with Venezuela, and oulo
glzcd Roosovelt with "Porlcardls
allvo or Rassull dead," and then
whllo sadly commenting upon tho
present standing of tho United
States with tho great powers of the
world, ho mado this ringing declara
tion "Tho world has always under
stood us until now." In en Instant
tho mighty throng was on Us fcot
nnd at no pluco throughout tho en
tiro addross of tho temporary chnlr
in nn was thero anything that thrill
ed tho hearts of tho multltudos llko
those ringing words. Almost ns with
magic, tho cheering thousands took
new hopo, and dedicated themselves
anew to tho task beforo them, de
termined that by tho tlmo the bal
lots were counted at tho next elec
tion. It would not bo possible for an
other such declaration to bo made.
Tho Republicans wero thoroughly
tatlstled with tho result of the con
vention, the Progressives very much
dissatisfied and disheartened. Mr.
Brynn declared "If personalities aro
eliminated, tho two parties seem to
be .already united upon a platform,"
and further declared that tho Pro
gresslvo Convention was a tragedy.
He predicted that Mr. Roosovelt
would not run and then "the Progres
sives will como to understand the
peril of building n porty upon a Per
sonality," further saying, "man Is
human, principles aro permanent nnd
therefore tho only pcrmnnent foundo
Hon upon which a party can rest."
Mr. Perkins, Mr. Cortelyou, Mr.
McGrath, secretary to Colonel Rooso
velt, nnd Colonel Roosovelt seemed
to ho. determined to delay the game
until the Republicans had nominated
a cnildldate. Mr. Roosevelt apparent
ly having determined that If ho
could not bo n candidate on both
tickets, ho would not nin nt all, his
chief deslro being to defeat Presi
dent Wilson whom ho declares "has
rendered this people tho most evil
service that can be rendered to a
great democracy."
When Colonel Roosovelt delivered
his message to the conferees sug
gesting Senator Lodgo tho contest
was over with but little ceremony,
tho leaders perceiving In o moment
that If tho Colonel could accept Sen
ator Lodgo thero waB no reason why
ho could not accept Justlco Hughes.
Mr. Medlll McCormlck, a gallant
Progressive who visited every stato
In tho Union four years ago In sup
port of Colonel Roosovelt was on his
feet nt the first opportunity and an
nounced that with tho withdrawal of
Senator Sherman the entire Illinois
delegation would bo cast for Justlco
Hughes. Ho paid Colonel Roosovelt
a great compliment and predicted
that tho Colonel would bo found In
tho Joint band wagon. At the Pro
gressive convention, Colonel Rooso
velt was then quickly nominated but
tho air cast over Progresslvo horizon
by Perkins, Cortelyou and McGrath,
followed by tho conditional declina
tion of Colonel Roosovelt himself,
attested anew his great deslro to
defeat tho Democratic party at what
ever expense necessary, and without
the counting of costs.
It Is Interesting to note tho com
ments of hitherto Progresslvo pa
pers on tho result of tho convention
and the nomination of Justice
Hughes. The Chicago Sunday Her
ald, and Independent nowspaper says
"Tho statemont with which Charles
Evang Hughes has broken Ills long
sttenco on political issues is one for
which no real American need feel
the slightest need of offering apol
ogy1," Tho editorial then commends
tho Justlco on tho speed with which
ho nccopted and then says, "One fea
ture of tho statement must strlko
most forcibly all oven casually fa
miliar with recent utterances of tho
leading men upon tho national situ
ation. If this statement hod been
read to any gathering without dis
closure or hint of tho Identity of Its
author, tho chances nro largo that
two thirds of Its hearers would havo
suspected Theodoro Roosovelt of Its
nuthoishlp. It contains a number
of phrasos which aro distinctly
Roosovcltlan, and its leading ideas
