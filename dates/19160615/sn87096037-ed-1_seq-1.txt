A COMMUNICATION
Monday night the City Council vot
ed to draft an ordinance to prohibit
Sunday base ball in the city of Hope.
The ordinance will become operative
after its proper readings and publica
tion. The vote for the ordinance was
a tie vote and therefore the mayor, as
chairman of the council, had to cast
his vote and he cast it in favor of the
ordinance. And we believe that after
a sober judgment has been rendered
our people will believe the mayor did
the right thing. Hope has prided her
self on not having Sunday base ball
and our eouncil feels, and no doubt
the majority of our citizens feel, that
the city does not want to lay down the
basis for an open Sabbath. Abraham
Lincoln once said, "As we keep or
break the Sabbath day, we nobly save
or meanly lose the last best hope by
which man rises." Base ball is an
excellent sport and has a physical,
mental and moral value when rightly
played. But if engaged in on Sunday
it cannot help but have an evil effect
upon the entire community and open
the way for other games and evil pas
times on the Sabbath. A community
has varied interests and one cannot
suffer without the other suffering with
him. The churches ask only one day
in seven and it is but fair that their
day should not be broken into by
other community-wide attractions.
Aside from a square deal for the
churches and religious interests of the
commvnity, the obedience of law and
order is of high importance to a com
munity and should be a common aim.
We believe in base ball and all clean
aports and we believe the business
men and the entire community ought
to stand by the base ball team and
give it their financial and moral sap
port so long as it stands by the best
interests of the city and community.
We further believe that the people of

Hope should stand by the mayor and
council in their action and encourage
them in their endeavors to give ua a
clean and law-abiding city. We urge
this attitude upon all the people of
Hope and ask that each one use hia
influence to maintain the high ideals
Hope has had through the years and
to help open the way for even better
things for the future of our city.

The Birth of a Nation Comming
The magnitude of David W. Grif
fith's feat in staging "The Birth of A
Nation, "is almost appalling—at least
to the devotees of the older forms of
theatrical entertainment. Where now
are the little groups of actors, the
pinchbeck scenery and the petty pro
perties of the so-called "legitimate"
drama? Hy comparison with the new
art, the "legitimate" measures to the
mountain like a molehill. Instead of
scenery for his background Griffith
has used nature. For subject he has
covered 150 years of American life and
history. Eighteen thousand people
have done his bidding and in the
hair-raising rides of the Ku Kluz
Is I an three thousand horses and rid
ers sweep ovor the dusty roads.
No wonder that this magnificent
historical spectacle is the talk of the
country. It has established an en
tirely new art in the realm of the
theatre—the art of pantomimic aoreen
spectacles with an orchestral score
perfectly synchronized to the action.
It.has also created a tremendoua sen
sation because of its vaster and more
forceful treatment of the theme of
Thomas Dixon's "The Clansman",
which as both book and play created
the greatest furore of the last decade.
The great deeds of the Civil War
and the horrors of Reconstruction are
made to live again and the nation re
born is apothesized. Mr. Griffith,
pioneer among directors, managed
this stupendous achievement without
the aid of dialogue or speech, for mo
tion pictures with musio and effects
tell vividly this thrilling tale of fifty
years ago.
"The Birth of a Nation" returns to
the Orplieum Theatre, Fargo, for one
week commencing Monday June 19.
Matinee daily.
Forethought
People are learning that a little fore
thought often save them abigexpense.
Here is an instance: E. W. Archer,
Clad well, Ohio, writes: "I do not be
lieve that our family has been without
Chamberlain's Colic, Cholera and
Diarrhoea Remedy sinoe we com
menced keeping house years ago.
When we go on an extended visit we
take it with us." Obtainable every
