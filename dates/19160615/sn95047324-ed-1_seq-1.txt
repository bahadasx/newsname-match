Meeting Malaria Problem
Four per cent of the inhabi
tants of certain sections of the
South have malaria. This esti
mate, based on the reporting of
204,881 cases during 1914, has
led the United States Public
Health Service to give increased
attention to the malaria problem,
according to the annual report of
the Surgeon General. Of 13,526
blood specimens examined by
Government officers during the
year, 1,797 showed malarial infec
tion. The infection rate among
white persons was above eight
per cejit, and among colored per
sons twenty per cent. In two
counties in the Yazoo Valley, .40
out of every 100 inhabitants pre
sented evidence of the disease.
Striking as the above figures
.' arc they are no more remarkable
than those relating to the roduc
tion in the incidence of the dis
ease following surveys of Ihe
V' Public Health Service at SI places
till nearly every state of the South.
... In some instances from an inci-
r dence of fifteen per cent, in 191-1
a reduction has been accomplish-"
ed to less than four or five per
- cent., in 1915.
- . One of the important scientific
discoveries madevduring the year
j.; was in regard to the continuance
.'; .'-of the disease from the season to
season. Over . 2,000 Anopheline
mosquitoes in malarious districts
'.j were dissected, during the early
spring months, without finding a
single infected insect, and not tin-.
til May 15, 1915, was the first
parasite in the body of a mosquito
discovered. The Public Health
Service, therefore, concludes that
mosquitoes in the latitude of the
Southern states ordinarily do not

This apparent generosity on the
part of the bankers is in many

in point is that of a Tkxas bank.
The president of the bank placed

securing and placing these pigs,
many new patrons were secured.
These patrons brought in over

The Laws a Failure
A few of the newspapers ex
press satisfaction with the work
ing of the Bryan primary law
and the Trammel! corrupt prac
tices act; many of them, howev
er, pronounce both laws a failure .
iuiiu ucuiaim men 1 1 jicai, mc
of the clearest editorials against
Li i r . ii t
ana demand their repeal. One
the primary law is the following
from Editor Jones of the Arcadia
News :
The object of a primary is to
get the will of a majority of the
people in the election of the can
didates for the different offices,
! If a primary fails to do this, iti(la' Gainesville. Some t cultures

Does the Bryan primary, in the
i light of the past elections, do
this? If it does not, it is a fail-
ure, and should be repealed. Let
us see: '

these men, Hudson, Wood and
Farris, were eliminated by the

in any of the possible ways we

are more than three candidates.
Added to this the fact that in
spite of the strenuous attempt on
the part of the press and others
to educate the people up to an
intelligent understanding of the
workings of the law, many yet
say they do not understand it,
and refuse to cast a second choice
vote. We believe that the law
has been tried and found inade
quate to meet the needs of tho
people, and should be repealed

According to A. L. JUason. as
sistant entomologist to the Board,
each culture will spray about an
! acre, lhis makes the cost tor
material about au cents an acre.
The cultures are sorit out in bot
tles. They should be thoroughly
mixed in a gallon of water. This
is made up to seventy gallons
with water. Counting seventy
trees to the cere and a gallon of
spray to the tree the foregoing
amount should treat an acre. It
is not necessary to spray the
whole tree. A ring around the
branches half way up is sufficient.
The fungus will spread over the
remaining part of the tree.
The best time to spray is dur
ing warm damp Aveather. It is
not advisable to spray during a
shower of immediately after one
because the fungus material
is
apt to wash off.
The supply of fungus material
which the Board can furnish is
limited and those who desire to
obtain it should write at once to

the full 1,000 will be ready by
early July. Full instructions for
application are sent with each
culture.
Wooly Whitefly Spreading
Reports to the University of
Florida Experiment Station indi
cate that the wooly whitefly is
spreading in certain sections on
the East Coast. The damage by
this pest is usually heaviest dur
ing the first two years of infesta
tion. Afterward the Chalcid, a
wasp-like parasite which feeds on
the larvae, keeps it partly in
check. But during the first two
years spraying should be given to
protect the citrus trees.
J. R. Watson, entomologist to
the Station recommends the para-
JTin oils for control. The fungi
which prey on the common citrus
whitefly do not control the wooly
lion which cau bc had 0,1 aPPlica-
tion. Address the
Station, Gainesville.
Experiment
Idle Land Leaks Fertility
Florida land should be kept
busy. Some farmers will quar
rel with that statement because
they think that land should have
a rest sometime during the year.
Some lands can be benefited by
resting if the vacation is applied
in the right way, but where there
is as much sun and rain as there
is in Florida, idle land does not
Because of the heavy snowfall
last winter, Forest rangers found
it necessary this spring to remove
two feet of snow from the Beav
er Creek Nursery iii Utah, so that
the young trees might be uncov
ered by the time they were need
ed for spring planting on the Nat
ional Forests of that region. Part
of the snow was taken off by uses
of shovel and pick. By spread
ing a thin layer of fine soil over
another part, the natural melting
of the snow was hastened suffi
ciently to make shoveling unnec
essary, y
rest. It leaks." This is especially
true in summer. The warm sun
and heavy rains facilitate plant
food liberation and the surplus
water carries, the plant food a
way. Did you ever notice the
color of the streams and creeks?
They get the organic matter that
should stay in the soil.
Some crop should be planted to
conserve the plant food, to shade
the land, to enrich the soil and to
, check the leaching
water. This
crop may be used as hay or green
manure. C. K. McQuarric, state
agent for the University of Flori
da Extension Division, recom
mends that some crop such as
German millet, cowpeas, early
velvet beans, or other legume be
planted on watermelon, or any
other land that has produced n
spring crop. It is true . that
weeds and grass will cover the
land and conserve some of the
plant food, but that land could
produce a valuable crop that
would not be so hard on ... it as
weeds, and the fertility could be
actually increased by the growth
of legumes. If the weeds are al
lowed to grow they probably will
be burned when another crop is
to be planted. Such practices are
wasteful. No farmer will burn a
cultivated crop, and all the plant
tood which it gathers will be
turned into feed or plowed under
to enrich tho soil.
Ihe remains of the spring crop,
vines, plants and fruits, should
be destroyed so that any disease
which they harbor will not be
carried over to infect new crops

-l
next year
Market
Demands Better
Live-
stock '
If Florida "is .to take its right
ful place in the livestock market,
it must produce better animals.
The state has already produced
its share of scrub stock, and a
change is due. Packing houses
have been obtaining their better
class of animals from other states.
The packing house which the
state has been waiting so long for
will need some good animals. If
Florida cannot furnish them some
other state will. Improvement
must bc made so that livestock
men will get some of the cream
instead of the skimmings.
Improvement cannot be made
by scrub sires. John M. Scott,
animal industrialist to the Uni
versity of Florida Experiment
Station, recommends purebred
sires to bc used on native darns.
In a few years the better quality
will show. Some men will want
to use purebred sires and dams.
That is commendable, but those
who want to improve their native
herds should do so through the
sire. ftect8 should show in the
first generation, which will give
an animal which is half purebred.
The second will give three fourths
purebred animals.
Good feed is another important
factor. No animal, however good,
can produce results if it is fed in
termittently or if it must rustle
for its feed. Livestock men should
provide forage, silage, and other
feeds during those months when
pasture is not abundant.
Good blood and feed will avail ;
little, however, if ticks are allow
ed free range on cattle. If some
provision is not made to protect
animals from ticks the effects of
all other efforts toward improve
ment will lie neutralized. .A few
range cattle men are dipping na
tive stock and find that it pays.
Dipping is imperative with pure
bred animals.
Germans Renew Attack

Paris, France, June 13. Ger
man troops Monday night renew
ed the attack over the whole sec
tion of the Verdun front west of
Thiaumont farm. They succeed
ed in entering some advanced
trenches at one point, but were
repulsed elsewhere, the French
war office announced Tuesday. .
The trenches penetrated by the
Germans were on the eastern
slope of hill 2S1 west of Thiau
mont. West of the'Meuso there
was artillery fighting during the
night. The bombardment was
heavy in the neighborhood of
Chattan court.
Health Insurance
Twenty-five out of every 1,000
employees in American industries,
according to recent statistics, are
constantly incapacitated by sick
ness, the average worker losing
appjjoxhnately nine days each
year on this account. This "non
effective rate" for the great
army of industrial workers in the
United States barely suggests the
total money loss to employers
and employees. The .lessened ef
ficiency, the effects of reduced
earnings in times of sickness, as
well as the cost of medical atten
tion, and the economic loss from
deaths, swell the cost to industry
and to the Nation to almost incal
culable figures.
That much of this loss is noth
ing less than preventable waste
and that this waste can be large
ly reduced by a properly conduct
ed system of governmental health
insurance for wageworkers are
conclusions set forth in Public
Health Bulletin No. 76, contain
ing the results of a study of
'1I11. Tr.iiminn lto TCilntlnn
to the Public Health," just issued
by the United States Public
Health Service.
The preventive value of health
insuranco is given especial em
phasis in this study. "Any sys
tem of health insurance for the
United States or any State should
at its inception have prevention
of sickness as one of its funda
mental purposes," says the bulle
tin. "This country should profit
by the experience of European
countries where prevention is be
ing recognized as the central idea
necessary to health insurance if
health insurance is to attain its
greatest success in improving the
health and efficiency of the indus
trial population." ,
Such a system, it is pointed out
in the bulletin, would
1. Provide cash benefits and
medical service for all wage-earn
ers in times of sickness at much
less cost than is now possible.
Adequate medical relief would
thus be placed within the reach of
even the lowest paid workers who
are most subject to ill-health
Z. Distribute the cost among
employers, employees, and the
public as the groups responsible
tor disease causing conditions
and afford these groups a definite
financial incentive for removing
these conditions. This can be
done by means of small weekly
payments from employees, sup
plemented by proportionate con
tributions from employers and
government at a rate reducible in
proportion to the reduction of
sickness.
3. Become an effective health
measure by linking the co-operative
efforts of the three responsi
ble groups with the work of Na
tional, State and local health ag
encies, and by utilizing these ag
encies in the administration of
the health insurance system.
4. Afford a better basis for
the co-operation of the medical
profession with public health ag
encies.
Eliminate the elements of
paternalism and chanty-giving
by making employees and the
public, as well as the employers,
joint agents in the control of this
fund.
A governmental system of
health insurance," concludes the
study, "can be adapted to Ameri
can conditions, and when adapt
ed will prove to be a health meas
ure of extraordinary value.
The statement follows:
"On the left bank of the river
Meusc there has been a bombard
ment in the region of Chattan
court. On the right bank of the
river the Germans renewed their
attacks along the entire sector
west of the Thiaumont farm and
they penetrated some of the ad
vanced trenches of our line along
the slopes on the east side of
Hill 321. Everywhere else the
German attacks were repulsed un
der the French fire. The night
passed in relative quiet elsewhere
