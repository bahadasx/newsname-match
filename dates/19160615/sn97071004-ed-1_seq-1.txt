order to afford them protection; that
he would be glad to accord protection
to Americana as well, but that, In
view of the increasing antagonfam by

PRESIDENT WILSON 0. KS PLANS Of
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION
WsHhlngton, I). C President Wll
son Sunday put his final approval on
plans for the Democratic National con
vention at St. Louis. After attending
cnurch with Mrs. Wilson in the morn.
Ing, he ont the afternoon and even
ing conferring with Democratic lead
ers. Secretary Iiaker, who will bo a dele
gate to the convention, saw the Preal
dent twice, and Dudley Field Malone,
collector of cuatoms at New York, also
conferred with him.
The Mexican plank in the Demo
cratic platform is giving administra
tion officials some concern because of
the continued uncertainty of the situa
tion. It was understood that the plank
will emphasize the policy of the Presi
dent of interfering as little as possible
in tha internal affairs of Mexico.
Although the President planned to
select a chairman of the Democratic
National convention before the conven
tion, he had not made up his mind
Sunday night. Homer Cummings,
National committeeman from Connec
ticut, and vice-chairman of the com
mittee, appeared to be the most likely
choice.
Mr. Wilson probubly will receive
official notification of hia nomination
at Shadow Lawn, the estate he has
taken for the summer in New Jersey.
Although he plans to remain in Wash
ington until congress adjourns, he
probably will make a short 'visit to
Shadow Lawn for the occasion.

He favors an undivided Americanism
on the part of all citizens.
Following are important points in

Washington, D. C The good roads
bill, which is now in the hands of a
conference committee, is expected to
be adjuatied and submitted to the sen
ate and house of representativea for
final adoption when congress resumes
active business after the National con
ventions. Present indications are that
the Walsh amendment appropriating
$1,000,000 a year for ten years for
roads in forest reserves will be agreed
to. especially aa Representative Shack
leford, chairman of the house commit
tee, la disposed to favor this proposi
tion.
There is radical difference between
the roads bill passed by the house, and
the bill subsequently passed by the
senate, but there is strong sentiment
in both branches of congress in favor
of some sort of good roads bill, and in
view of this demand, the conference
committee is expected to get together
with as little delay as possible, that
some bill may be put into effect by or
before July 1.
The Walsh amendment is substan
tially the plan proposed by the secre
tary of Agriculture, and while the
money paid for roads will, in the first
instance, be appropriated for the
treasury, the appropriations will be
reimbursed in time from that portion
of forest reserve receipts that other
wise would go direct to the states. It
has been generally agreed among
Western senators and representatives
that it will be impossible to secure an
outright appropriation , from the treas
ury for building roads in forest re
serves, and accepting that situation,
Westerners have been content to ac
cept the Walsh plan.

Supreme Court Justice is Nominated on Third Ballot, Vote
Being Practically Unanimous.
Coliseum, Chicago, June 10. Charles
Evans Hugehs was named today the
Republican candidate in the coming
election. It was 12:27 o'clock when
Delaware was reached on the third roll
call of the convention. The vote to
that point had been practically unani
mous, all opposition had collapsed, the
name of RooBevelt had been with
drawn, and the fight was over.
Seldom has there been a convention
of any party in which the final mo
menta were as tense aa those in the
Coliseum today. From the first minute
of the convention gathering it waa al
most a certain thing that Hughes
would win, but dread of Roosevelt
power and dickering with the Bull
Moose convention made every man in
the Caliseum uneasy, until Alabama,
Arizona, Arkansas and California votes

Colorado, on the first call, cast nine

nothing to say. I will answer no ques
tions, so please don't ask me to. I
am out of politics."
Washington, D. C, June 10 Charles
Evans Hughes stepped down today
from the Supreme bench and, again a
private citizen, accepted the Repubh
can nomination tor President in a
telergam ringing with denunciation of
the administration's foreign policy and
declaring for a dominating, thorough
going Americanism, he gave his decis
ion to Chairman Harding, of the Re
publican Natoinal convention, and
broke the long silence which had kept
the leaders of his party in the dark as
to his attitude toward the great issues
of the day.
"I have not desired the nomina
tion," said the telegram. "I have
wished to remain on the bench. But
in this critical period of our National
history, I recognize that it is your
right to summon and it is my para
mount duty to respond."
Within an hour after Chairman
Harding had notified him of his nomi
nation Mr. Hughes had accepted the
call. His resignation, a scant two-
line letter without a superfluous word,
was on its way to the White House,
from the Hughes home before the
nominee had dispatched the message of
acceptance, and called the waiting
group of newspaper men into hia study
to tell them of his decision. President
Wilson accepted the resignation in a
reply almost as brief. Apparently
Mr. Hughes letter was framed so that
the President might be saved the em
barrassment of expressing regret or
making more than a formal reply.
"I hereby resign the office of asso
ciate justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States," he wrote. To
which the President replied : "I am
in receipt of your letter of resignation
and feel constrained to yield to your
desire. I therefore accept your resig
nation as jusitce of the Supreme Court
of the United States, to take effect at
once.
University of Oregon Celebrates
Fortieth Anniversary This Week
University of Oregon, Eugene The
fortieth anniversary of the opening of
the Universty of Oregon waa cele
brated Monday June 6. Other eventa
of the day were the commencement ad
dress by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, pres
ident of Leland-Stanford university,
to the University of Oregon graduat
ing class; and the laying of the cor
nerstone of the new Education building.
The story of the founding of tha
State University has a romantic cart.
The pioneers of Lane county hard
working men with few resources;
most of them raised S50.000 to in
duce the state to locate the university
I at Eugene; and their 1 50. 000 waa
devoted to the building of Deady hall.
These early settlers made all kind of
sacrifices to raise the money: One
man would sell a cow and give a por
tion of the proceeds; another would
give the returns from two or three
sacks of wheat from a load he had
hauled to town.
The graduating class thia vear num
bers about 100. Some of them will
pursue post-graduate work, some wilb
go into business, a few will continue
work for professional occupations, and
many will enter high school teaching.
