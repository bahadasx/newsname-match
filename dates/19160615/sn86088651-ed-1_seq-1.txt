Laredo, Texas, June 15. One hun
dred Mexican bandits, crossing the Rio
Grande at 2 o'clock this morning at
8an Ignacio, 40 miles southeast of
here, attacked two troopa of the Four,
teenth Cavalry, killing two and wound
ing five Americana. Six Mexicana
were found dead and their clothing
waa wet, indicating they had just ford
ed the river. Major Cray, commanding
the cavalry, after half an nour'a fight,
pursued the bandits south on the
American aide of the river and may
follow them Into Mexican territory.
The namea of the dead could not be
learned at frt Mcintosh here on ac
count of lack of wire communication
in thdistrict where the bandits are
being pursued. The Mexicana did not
try to raid the town, but made a di
rect and premeditated attack on the
soldiers, expecting to find a smaller
body of troops than was there. The
Mexicana were dressed In peon garb
but were exceptionally .well armed.
