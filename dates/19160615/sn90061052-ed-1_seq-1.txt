The Republican Convention
The situation that has developed as

gressive conventions seems to be most
satista6tory to the rank and file and
to nearly nil the Readers of the same
Mr Hughes is a splendid compromise
candidate standing for practically all
that Mr Roosevelt contended for and
having taken no part in the disruption
of the party Mr Fairbanks running
mate with Mr Hughes is a Republican
of unquestioned integrity an American
first last and all the time and n man
active in religious and charitable work
Just what Via lurdock and Gov
Illram Johnson ondiftvery few other
progressive leaders moy do remains to
be seen but die majority of their fellows
are announcing their allegiance to
Hughes and predicting his election In
November
Of course the J3mocratic convention

Take a Tip From Mother Natar
Maybe the house needs a coat of paint the fence out
buildings or screens a little dingy How about the
woodwork in the house and the floors Do they need
a little brightening Does the furniture show
scratches Painting and varnishing not only beauti
fies but it makes the wood last longer and its really
cheaper to paint than not
