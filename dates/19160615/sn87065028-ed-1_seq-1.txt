Columbus I anxious t secure
one of the Farm Loan Ranks whih
the Federal government proposes to
establish in various towns ami ritics
to furnish money to planter to
carry on farming operations, and
with that end in view Secretary J.
G. Weathi rly, of the local Chamber
of Commerce, has launched a cam
paign which is backed by 'lie finan
cial, mercantile, manufacturing and
farming interests of this section
and which will be 'prosecuted with
the utmost vigor.
The opening gun of the campaign
was fired Tuesday, when Secretary
Weatherly wrote strong letters to
Senator John Sharp Williams, Sena
tor James K. Vardamnn and every
Conirre?sman of the state earnestly
soliciting their co-operation in the
movement and urging them to in-
dorre Columbus as a site for one of
the proposed banks.
In these letters the claims of
Columbus were cogently and suc
cinctly set forth, Mr. Weatherly hav
ing directed the attention of the
statesmen to the fact that while
many steps have been taken to aid
the large cities of the country little
or rothing has been done for the
towuiT Which at c.airi'y titu

"'Mr Weatherly's letter to 3 nnf .'
Williams follows;
"Senator John Shr,) W lliams,
"Washington, D. C.
"Dear Sir:
"Columbus announces that she
has launched a campaign to get one
of the Farm Loan Banks. Missis
sippi has been content because she
is agricultural in her pursuits, to let
all of the big worthwhile things go
elsewhere and usually to the biK
towns. Atlanta got the Federal Re
serve Bank, a fight is to be made to
have the Federal nitrogen , plant
built on the Tennessee river, l!ir
mingham is going to fight for the
armor plant, or some of the other
preparedness propositions.
"Now, if all of the government's
moiu ;' is to be spent to make the
big towns larger, to the sure end
that the large towns attract more
people from the. country, then the
rural population of America will
continue to decrease.
"It seems to me that the Farm
I.oan Bank should be placed in a
, farming section, and certainly there
is no finer farming section in the
southeast than that of which Colum
bus is the center.
"In order to win for Columbus in
this matter, it is necessary that both
Mississippi Senators endorse our po
sition and fight with us. It will be
necessary for every Congressman in
Mississippi to support Columbus to
the limit also. I believe that we can
i win with a united front. May we not,
Senator, count on your active sup
port? Very truly yours,
"J. G. Weatherly, Secretary."

The hay growers of Lowndes
county have been called to assemble
at the Chamber of Commerce in this
city at 2 o'clock Saturday afternoon
for the purpose of discussing a prop
osition to join the Alabama-Mississippi
Hay Growers' Association,
which is soon to be formed for the
purpose of promoting and protecting
the interests of growers of the le
gume in these two states.
Several prominent agronomists
and hay experts will be present,
among those scheduled - to address
the meeting being Prof. J. F. Dug
gar, who has charge of farm demon
stration at the Alabama Polytechnic
cal Institute at Auburn. Ala.. Prof.

stroyed by fire Monday night, and
'Mr. P.) land I'rowell, son of the own-
jer, who was formerly deputy sheriff
of Lowndes county, was severely
hurt while fighting the flames, hav
ing sustained burns, bruises and
other painful injuries.
The fire, the origin of which is
unknown, made its appearance about
1 11 o'clock, and was discovered by
Mrs. I'rowell, who was awakened by
the crashing sound of falling glass.
She immediately gave the alarm,
and laborers on the place were sum
moned to the scene by the ringing of
the farm bell. They formed a bucket
: brigade and by efficient work saved
the large dairy and- barn. The resi
dence however, and smokehouse
were burned to the ground, together
with most of the contents, the only
articles saved having been the parlor
furniture and one budoir suit.
The house was an ante-bellum
structure and was one of the hand
somest country homes in this section.
The loss will amount to between
$8,000 and $10,000, while the in
surance was only $3,000.

NEW MANAGEMENT CONTEM
PLATES PURCHASE OF ADDL
' TIONAL EQUIPMENT.
Announcement of the intention
of the Columbus Railway, Light and
Power Company 'to purchase new
'equipment is made by Mr. R. B.
Claggett, the general manager of
the corporation, who states that a
representative will soon be sent
north to buy three double-truck
, trolley cars and a 500-kilowatt
1 generator.
j Mr. Claggett states that the cus
tom of having cars meet at the cor
ner of Market and College streets
will soon be abandoned and that the
old junction point at the intersec
tion of Main and Market streets
will be re-established. This corner
is the recognized center of 'the bus
iness d.strict, and it will be much
more convenient for patrons to wait
for cars there than at the present
junction point.
It is the intention of the company
to maintain a 15-minute schedule
and keep the cars always on time.
Other improvements are contem
plated. Mr. Winnfield Sargent, of Macon,
is in the city.
Misses Etta and Lillie Eichelber

The hay growing industry has
made rapid progress in this section
during the past few years, and pro
ducers feel the urgent need of an

posed to form will probably have
headquarters in Birmingham, and
will employ a competent manager to
look after the marketing of the pro
duct of its members.

President Wilson are certainties and
there will be no friction regarding
the adoption of a platform, the draft
of which has already been approv

On Monday there was in circula

Wilson has let it be known that he

have wilted away under the influ

the White House. Secretary Baker,

also effectually disposed of the vice
presidential boom in his own behalf,
which had attained prominence in
the belief in some quarters that Mr.
Marshall lucked genuine administra

"The President is for the renom

was the emphatic statement made
by Secretary Baker, upon his arrival
with the platfurm draft substantial

not wholly, by the President him

movement started in my behalf, I
am for Mr. Marshall. I am here as a
delegate from Ohio; I ran in a pop

REPORTS INDICATE ANIMOSITY
TOWARDS AMERICANS IS
GROWING.
Sun Antonio, Texas., June 13.
General Pershing in his official re
port of the routing of what is believ
ed to have been the largest surviving
band of Villa followers in the state
of Chihuahua, near Santa Clara, on
June 9, states that several of the
Mexicans were killed and others
were wounded, and two rifles and
25 horses were captured.
Newspapers brought to F:i Paso to
day from several cities in the inter
ior of Mexico showed an increasing
animosity for Americans. Editorials
in most of them referred to Carran-
za's recent note as "a slap in the
face of Uncle Sam," while stories of
volunteer corps organizing for duty
in case of international trouble were
frequent.
Today's reports to local mining
companies from their representa
tives in Chihuahua City and Parral
indicated that the antagonism
against the United States continues
and that minor demonstrations are
frequent, but that the militia had
the people sufficiently under con
trol. That some Carran?.a officials are
behind the sudden outbreak of anti
American feeling in the republic
was the assertion today of a well in
formed Mexican upon his arrival
from the interior.
To Improve Phone Service.
Extended improvements are being
made in the local plant of the Cum
berland Telephone and Telegraph
Company, and both city and rural
patrons will realize material benefit
therefrom.
In the city poles are to be placed
in conduits, while the rural system
will be entirely overhauled and the
number of phones on party lines
reduced from eight to six. The rates
rate as' low as 60 cents per month
being offered to rural patrons on
party lines.

OCKATIC VICIOKY.
If I he Colonel Diein't Hun An
othrr Candidate Will Be Cut
in the Field.
Aivi'rdifig t-i an interview With
tieoive S. O'lli' ir, a prominent It t r
niiiurliarn lull Mmm-r, which ap
peared in th A?e Herald Monday,
the action of the Republican in
nominating Jjtice Hughe means
the complete defection of the Pro
gressive party and will result in the
re-election of President ilson by a
overwhelming majority.
Mr. O'Pear, who attended the re
cent convention in Chicago said
that the Progressives had no iib'a
of endorsing Hughes, and if Roose
velt decides to make final his tenta
tive refusal to the nomination Gov
ernor Johnson of California or some
other man of equal prominence
would be named as the party's rL.n
dard bearer. An excerpt from the
interview follows:
"Everything is so much in the air
that it is difficult to know just what
to say about the situation," sum
Mr. O'Pear, "but I am confident of
one thing, and that is Roosevelt's
action means a walkover for Wil
son in November.
"In spte of the reports which
have been sent out about compro
mises with the Republicans and all
that sort of rot, there was never the
slightest chance for a compromise
on a Republican candidate. The con
venton of the Progresses was prac
tically unanimous on that. The Pro
gressives are Progressives from
principle l.od ii. is naturaiiy hard
for those old line Republican poli
ticians who are out for spoils to un
derstand that. The Chicago papers
were full of talk of compromise,
but there was nothing to it. Wc
knew what we wanted. We stood for
certain principles and we stand for
them yet.
"If Roosevelt decides finally not
to run the Progressive committee
will meet and nominate another man
like (iovernor Johnson of California
and he will run it out. As for the
Progressive committee's endorsing
Hughes, there is not a chance.
"I talked with men from all over
the United States and they would
be indignant even at the suggestion
of such a thing. They are down on
the Republicans and will never treat
with them. You may rest assu.-'"I
that there will be a strong Progres
sive candidate in the field and i:i
n y opinion his presence me-m a
walkover for Wilson.
"That, however, is merely inci
dental. We are going to fight for
what we think is right. There are
not nuwe than Jwo men on the Ala
bama Progressive committee who do
not feel as I do about tJiis and they
are men who think more really of
the pie counter than they do of
what the Progressive party stand
for.
"We don't understand Roosevelt'
, action, of course None of the dele
gates with whom I talked could un
derstand it. It was like a thunder
chip. Perhaps he will explain sat
isfactorily later, but if he still de
clines to run our committee has been
