It is probably the den'ire of
every member of the Chippewa
bands of Minnesota to have tribal
matters settled upon a basis thai
will place to the credit, in the
United States Treasury, the share
of each person who is entitled to
participate in the tribal funds of
the Chippewas of Minnesota.
Chippewa matters have been
well started towards a settlement
by Senator Clapp and it is to the

interest of the Chippewas that
Jfchey should not neglect to take
the day off on the 19,h of this
month and go to the polls and vote
for him.
Senator Clapp has been a true
friend to all the Chippewas of
Minnesota, and has been in fact,
as ex-Commissioner Dar S. Hall
expressed it last year, the best
United States senator Minnesota
has ever had.
So far as the. Chippewas are
concerned it is up to them to now
show their gratitude for the good
work Senator Clapp has done for
them in the past since he has been
in Congress, by supporting him
solidly at the primary election.
The Nomination Of
Justice Hughes.
The nomination of Justice
Hughes of the Supreme Court of
the United States, by the Repub
lican party, as its candidate for
Presidency of the United States,
received by the Republi
can generally with a grimace.
To sum it up briefly Justice
Hughes not the candidate a
very large majority of the voters
wished to see nominated. Col.
Roosevelt was the choice of the
people, but the German alliance
dictated the nomination of Hughes
by agreeing to give him about
three million German votes of the
country.
The boasted Americanism of the
epublican party is briefly this

German alliance by a few politici

at Chicago. The German citizens

Roosevelt for his outspoken senti
ments in favor of America as
against Germanj*, and they in
jected the matter into American
politics.
Neither do the American Ger
mans like President Wilson's pol
icy towards Germany, and for this
reason they intend to punish him
at the election next November in
the same manner they have pun
ished Col.i Roosevelt. True
Americanism will not stand for
this. Candidates For lie-Elec-
tion.
Among the candidates for re
election to a state office this year
is Ira B. Mills, who is now one of
the railroad and warehouse com
missioners.
Mr. Mills is well and favorably
known among many of the resi
dents of this reservation. For
years he was a United States Com
missioner at Moorhead, which
position he held until I.is eltction
as a railroad and warehouse com
missioner.
It is hoped that Mr. Mills will
receive a good and substantial
vote among his friends on the
reservations, for one good turn
deserves another and Mr. Mills
did many good turns for some of
the boys while he was a United
States commissioner and not al
ways in an official capacity.
Indian Office Extends
s.
The Indian office at Washington,
has extended greetings, through
Assistant Commissioner of Indian
Affairs Merritt, by telegram to

wishes as to the harmonious time,
fraught with good will towards
one another and friendship to
wards your Sioux brethern, who
come as your guests. May this
meeting work an epoch in closely
uniting all Chippewas and the
Sioux in a lasting brotherhood and
broadening your influence as Amer
ican citizens and a deeper appreci
ation, love and respect for the
glorious flag."

came educated, Indian wars ceased
to exist. Today the celebration
is being conducted exclusively by
educated Indians, and they are do
ing this in a manner that is a
credit to themselves and the Chip

Appropos to the cession of the
six Chippewa reservations near
the Mississippi in Crow Wing
county, it is very doubtful wheth
er the Chippewas made even
a fair bargain, for it is upon their
old reservations that a number of
iron mines are now in operation,
and many million dollars worth of
iron has already been found there
and is being shipped. But at that
time no thought was given to iron,

regarding the alleged discovery of
gold in 1866, which soon died out,
and en account of the fertility of
the soil here the government ex
pected to make every Indian a
farmer.
It will not be many years before
the annual celebration here will
cease entirely, for those who take
a deep interest in the matter will
cease to do so, and the younger
element will no doubt fail to be
impressed by the sentiment that
now causes the genuine members
of the tribe to observe the day.
