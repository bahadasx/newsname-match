Contestants.
BUCKMAN APPEARS STRONGEST
IN CONGRESSIONAL RACE

Citizens are Urged to

the state, voters will have the op
portunity to vote direct for a nom
inee for S. senator. The candidates
are Senator Moses E Clapp, Frank
Kellogg, Adolph O. Eberhart and
Charles A Lindbergh. Clapp, al
though he has not made an active
campaign, will receive a large num
ber of votes on account of his past
record. Sentiment for him is in
creasing daily.
Democrats Have Ticket.
Daniel Lawler of St Paul and Al
fred Davis of Minneapolis are af
ter the senatorial nomination on the
Democratic side.
In the race for the gubernatorial
nomination on the Republican ticket,

chairman of the railroad and ware
house commission. O. A. Hedin of
Minneapolis is the Democratic candi
date.
Interest in Race.
For congress in the Sixth district,
C. B. Buckman of Little Falls appears
to have the best of the race over E.
Rogers of Walker and Harold
Knutson of St. Cloud for the Repub
lican nomination.
For associate justice of the su
preme court, James H. Quinn, Albert
Schaller, W. B. Anderson and Thomas

They are L. G. Pendergast of Be
midji, Charles Carter of Hines, Sam
Sherman of Williams, E. W. Hannah
of Bemidji and Helic Clementson of
Clementson.

are the candidates.

RAILROAD MEM RE
SOLID FOR BUCKMAN
(By Special Correspondent)
Little Falls, Minn., June 15.On
Wednesday, C. B. Buckman, candi
date for congress, was at Brainerd on
the invitation of several leading rail
road men who are ardent supporters
of the local man.
The railroad men of Brainerd are
practically solid for the Little Falls
man for congress. They have checked
up his past record as it related to
the working man and have found
that he was always with the man who
toils.
Mr. Buckman has always been a
big employer of labor and it is note
worthy that employes of many years
are his best supporters in the present
campaign. HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI

Club.
URGES WIDENING AND
DEEPENING OF CHANNEL
Red Lake at Present is More Than
Four Feet Above Normal High
Water Stage.
J. J. Opsahl, representing the Be
midji Commercial club, has written
to Senators Nelson and Clapp and
Representatives Lindhergh, Steener
son and Volstead, requesting them to
take immediate action to curb the
floods in the Red Lake district. He
urges that the Red Lake river be
widened and deepened.
Above Normal.
The Red Lake is at present four
teet above its normal high water
stage, causing it to back up differ
ent rivers and clog the outlet to the
large net of drainage ditches in the
Battle River valley as well as the
Shotley and Tamarac river valleys
The lands of several hundred settlers
have been flooded.
Mr. Opsahl's letter in part is as
follows:
Immediate Action.
"At the meeting of the Bemidji
Commercial club on Tuesday, June
6, the condition of the flood sufferers
in the Red Lake valley was thorough
ly discussed, and a resolution was un
animously passed deciding to ask for
the active co-operation of the Federal
government through the interior de
partment, Indian department, war de
partment and of the state drainage
department of the state of Minnesota,
and of the counties and land owners,
whether they be white or red, own
ing lands that are affected by the
present flood stage of the.Red Lake,
for the relief of these people (who in
actuality arer the real part of the
Federal government in that district.)
And as you have taken a leading hand
in the opening up and development
of the thirteen towns, the eleven
towns and what was called ceded
Red Lakelands, under the Nelson act
of 1889, as well as the Red Lake
forestry bill of 1916, we wish to ask
you to take an active interest in find
ing the proper practical remedy for
the straightening, widening and deep
ening of the channel of the Red Lake
river from the outlet of Red Lake
to a point at or near Highlanding,
which will approximately (according
to the geological and state drainage
survey) mean dredging work for 27
miles, of which about 17 miles the
old channel can be used and about 10
miles of cut-offs should be made so
as to provide the proper outlet and
rapid discharge of the water in years
like 1915 and 1916 of heavy snows
and large rainfalls.
Farm Lands Raised.
"By such lowering the channel of
the Red Lake river, the farm lands
from Highlanding on both sides of
the river, to Red Lake would be auto
matically raised, according to the
depth of the lowering of the river
bed. From Highlanding to Neptune
postofflce, is a district thickly set
tled by thrifty farmers who have
been drowned out by the overflow of
the river in 1915, as well as this year
in 1916, and the same condition af
fects the fertile prairie lands and
meadows on both sides of the river
from Neptune to Red Lake on the
Diminished Reservation, and the low
ering of the river is needed in order
to find an outlet for lateral drainage
ditches from the north or south, both
inside and outside of the reservation,
in this stretch of 27 miles.
A Natural Reservoir.
"The further object that must be
gained is to arrange to lower the river
so that the Red Lake level can be
lowered during the winter time at
least three feet, in order to provide
Is Scoop At The Convention?Well, You're TootiiT
a natural reservoir in the spring to
hold the flood waters that are hur
riedly emptied into the lake every
spring by the network of drainage
ditches in the Red Lake basin, to the
north, east and south of the lake."

Secondary Keynote Speech of the
Democratic Concevtion
is Given.
PLANKS OF PLATFORM
SUBMITTED BY PRESIDENT
Convention is Entire Dominate by
Wilson May Be Named
Friday.
By United Press)
St Louis, June 15.With his voice
burning with emotion, Senator Ollie
James at the Democratic convention
today lauded President Wilson's
achievements. He named him the
greatest living American. His ad
dress was the secondary keynote
speech of the Democratic convention.
There was a tremendous ovation af
ter the address. Senator James ap
pealed to the nation not to swap
horses as it was crossing a bloody
stream He made a plea for recog
nition that President Wilson is a
master, diplomat and unconquerable
leader
Making* Platform.
Hyphenated organizations of the
United States are charged with at
tempting to influence the United
Slates in foreign relation negotia
tions, are vigorously denounced in the
Democratic platform. Wilson's ideas
if suffrage, international relations
nd Mexico, although Mexico is not
mentioned directly, dominate the
platform. Wilson's tentative draft
which was brought here by Secre
tary Baker contains only the high
spots.
For 8-Honr Day.
President Wilson wants an army
and navy that is sufficiently strong to
maintain the Monroe doctrine, for a
protective tariff in the dye industry
and an eight-hour laboring day.
The platform builders are working
to make the platform attractive to
the Progressives but the kidnapping
plans for the child have been aban
doned. Bryan is urging all that is
possible to be done to win over the
Moose but Bryan cannot talk for
mally. He is a mere newspaper re
porter.
Is a Fliver.
The convention was called to or
der at 11:49 this morning. Tem
porary Chairman Glynn officiated at
the opening. Delegates were weary,
noisy and there was nothing to do.
Two hundred from the convention
crowd slipped out this morning. The
crowds are beginning to get smaller
and business is slack. As a big show
the convention is a fliver.
May Adjourn Tomorrow.
Certain efforts are being made to
adjourn the convention sine die to
morrow. Today's session was de
voted entirely to oratory.
Reports from Washington today
are that President Wilson will take
personal command of his campaign
for re-election. He will announce
his selection of campaign manager
Saturday.
Delegate Dies.
William Kaistang, postmaster, Buf
falo, N. Y., a delegate to the Demo
cratic convention, died suddenly this
morning. His death is believed to
have been due to appoplexy.
Nominate Friday.
The convention is entirely domin
ated by Wilson. The convention will
do nothing that" is not mapped out
for it. Friday, a hoodoo day, was
-passed as unlucky for nomination.
Here is another instance of Wilson
domination. He let is be known
that he considered Friday his lucky
day so the convention has decided to
nominate him Friday.
Returning from a steamer excur
sion and a baseball game to look in
on where the convention is being held
the Minnesota Democratic delegates
said that they probably would ndt
take any action on the Lynch propo
sition until after Wilson's nomina
tion. Indications are that the vote
is tied, with Lynch perhaps holding
the balance.
