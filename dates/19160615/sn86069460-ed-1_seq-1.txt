Roosevelt was nominated
today by the progressive natiorw

roar and tumult and the delegates
never wavered in their allegiance
or cast a passing glance ucon

Three minutes before the con

a few weeks they might be a
party without the one leader to
whom they came to Chicago to
give their pledge of loyalty and
faith.
