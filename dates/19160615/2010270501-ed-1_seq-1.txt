delivered the address or

which was as follows:
AnmtDSH OF WELCOME
By Mrs. Capitola Tully. president of !
Alliance Chapter: i
To me has been given the rare op- j
portunity of welcoming to our city 1
the state crand chanter of the sis-!
terhood of P. E. O.. and I wish I
might express to the satisfaction
which those of us. members or chap
ter AH, feel in your visit here. We
are happy in our homes at the
thought of this visit from you ana 1
am sure that your star will admit you
10 the most "reserved . Our nearly
leuire is to pronote the efficiency
and enjoyment of this convention.
We all love to mark tlie passing
years by the friends they bring us.
May the one impression at least
which you carry away with you be
that you have added to your list of
friends the members of chapter AH;
and when we separate and you re
turn to your homes with our well
wishes, may the influence of this
gathering be
"Like a wreath of scented roses,
that entwines each heart,
Cntil time and change In .concert
shall tear the wreath apart."
Most of you have truveled many
miles to be with u. and have proba
bly for the first time begun to realize
that our Nebraska is a state of mag
nificent distances. We hope that
the brilliancy of the stars awaiting
you in Alliance h:.ve led you on In
your Journey, us the star of old led
;lie 'wist? Men" to the ardent city
of Bethlehem, and may all your an
ticipated pleasures become realities.
To welcome to Alliance a state
convention of the sisterhood of P. E.
O. Is a pleasant duty, and to those of
us to whom the history of northwest
Nebraska is familiar ,it is another
event compelling the startling real
ization of a wonderful transforma
tion. Who of you had been permit
ted a view of this section of Nebras
ka even in bo short a time past a
the date of the organization of chap
ter AH. could have forseen euch a
change?
Except for a healthful climate, no
great natural advantages are to be
found here. Ceaseless energy, In
domitable ambition, and the faith of
pioneers has built a city in which we
all take pride. This growth of Alli
ance into one of the most ambitious
cities of the West is but the index of
the growth and development In the
country, which is nothing Bbort of
marvelous.
"Soddles" have given place to i
large ranch house, with every mod -
ern convenience, and with the unl -
versa, use of the. -utomo
iiiiihi remote iuiit.ii 'yuaiumui o
become our often calling neighbor.
All this has cone within the time
that some of us have lived here. The
changes wrought in tho twelve years
that it has taken l E. O. to uecide
to co're and see us, have made us,
so we proudly think, quite worthy to
be seen.
Distances sometimes inclines to
cynicism, a nearer view to optimism.
May It be so with our long stretches
of rolling hills and wind-blown prai
ries. Now that you are here In their
midst, may their environment help
shed the light of truth and Idealism
upon thia convention.
We aim to make you as glad to
have come as we are glad to have
you come, and we hope to make you
long remember with pleasure your
visit to the capital of the slate of
Good-Fellowshlp. Alliance.
"We Just shake hands at meeting .
With many that come nigh;
We nod the head in greeting
To many that go by;
But welcome through the gateway
Our few real friends and true.
Then hearts leap up, and straight
way There's open house for you, dear
friends,
There's open house for you."
The response, made by Mrs. El
llnor O. Kemp, treasurer, was as fol
lows: HESPONKK TO WEIiOOMF.
By Mrs. Elltnor Kemp, treasurer of
Nebraska Grand Chapter, Fuller
ton, Nebr. :
Madam President and Sister P. E.
1. s:
Your president has accorded me
tne pleasant privilege oi manning
chapter AH in behalf of the conven
tion for their cordial welcome and
delightful hospitality.
No doubt we all felt that our P. E.
O. sisters here would be glad to have
us with them but I'm sure we were
pleased and a little flattered when
our chapter received that official
looking letter from Alliance Commer
cial Club and we found that the busy
men had paused to make recognition
of our coming and bid us welcome.
We are delighted with your city and
Its evidences of thrift, energy and
culture and these days spent In your
pleasant homes will ever remain a
cherished memory.
This Is a Joyous occasion for Ne
braska P. E. O.'b. It celebrates the
entrance of our sisterhood Into new
'territory and a territory of which we
are most proud. A few days ago I
heard Chancey Depew, who by the
way is a more vigorous and enter-
taiuing speaker at 82 years of age
than many men are at 50, say that
we as Americans don't appreciate
our country, that we are so accus
tomed to our blessings that we take
them as a matter of course and don't
realize what we have. May not the
same thing be said of us as Nebras
kans that we are not sufficiently ap
preciative of our state.
. Did you know that Nebraska cov
ers more square miles than does
New York state? Wo think of Mass
achusetts, the oldest New England
: tate, as being immensely wealthy,
and of course she Is. but In our Btate
coffers at Lincoln there are more
than $300,000 In Massachusetts
state bonds. One hears so much of
culture east, yet Nebraska has a
smaller per cent of illiteracy than
any eastern state. Probtbly most
of us are so well protected by hus
bands, brothers and fathers I hat It
has not been necessary for us to con
sider the property rights of women.
but I had an incident called to my ai
tentlon a couple of years ago In Tex
as. A friend in San Antonio whose
husband had died a few ycain before
had Invested her money i:i a raini!
hotel, a new building well construct
ed Hnd furnished, !n a desirable lo
cation. Th) income from It provid
ed w-j'.l for herself and two children
She was a charming widow and h
young man came to woo. They were
sitting on the veranda one evening
when the young man casually men
tioned what he Intended doing with
the hotel when they were married.
Needless to say, my friend was
astounded. She consulted a lawyer,
and found that the minute she mar
ried, her husband would acquire ab
solute title to her property. What
ever she may have thought of the
man, she loved her children devoted
ly and she broke the engagement
next day. But such conditions can
not exist In Nebraska. Here a wo
man has absolute title to her own
property and her husband is unable
to sell or to give even a mortgage on
any real estate without her signature.
Then we have a compulsory educa
tion law. the mothers' pension law
and In fact the women of the state
have little to ask In the way of laws
favorable to them unless perchance
tbey want a suffrage law, and they
may R that a little later.
When we consider that It has been

the advancement
our. state has made along all lines.
Our first legislature waB composed of
37 representatives and 13 seuators,

five from all the rest of the state. The
population has Increased fro n 120,

was composed of 100 representatives
and 33 senators. The western part
of the state has developed rapidly
and has now a goodly representation,
not only in numbers but in ability.

YOUNG BURG1AR BREAKS
OUT OF COUNTY-JAIL
Clever Crook licks Lock and Escapes
Monday mgnt from tlie uox
Butte County Jail
,
Charley Buel, arrested last Thurs
day evening by Sheriff Cal Cox for
breaking into the home of Perry
Malley, west of Alliance, some tlms
during Monday night, escaped from
the county Jail, on the fourth floor of
the new Box Butte county court
house.
How Buel managed to pick the
lock is a mystery. The sheriff be
lieves that he managed to make a
skeleton key from the tin spoon giv
en him to feed himself at supper
time. When deputy Miller took his
supper lo him Monuay evening he
was asleep and the deputy slipped
the supper under the cell door.
Buel was confined in the dark cell
at the north of the Jail. The cell

which were braid' i d into a rope more

rope is on display in the windows of
the E. G. Laing t ore.
Buel had also taken three blan
kets, tied them together and proba
bly had Intended (o ue them as an
additional rope. They were lying on
the skylight whi Si is ovei the sec
ond floor. It appears that he had
planned to break through this sky
light and let himself down to the
first floor but found the stairway
leading to the second floor and the
sheriff's oflice. The heavy oak door
at the bottom of this stairway was
locked. Buel had wrenched the top
of the door casing loose and with this
board bad broken the glats out from
this door. He then went to the sher
iff's oflice, opened the door from the
inside, passed down to the first floor,
opened a window in the men's toilet
room, pushed back the screen and es
caped from the building.
The Box Butte county Jail was re
cently pronounced by Mr. Cunning
ham, state Jail Inspector, who was
here In May, to be absolut.-ly svfe.
and to be one of the two "perfect"
Jails In the state. No blame for the
escape is attached to Sheriff Cox or
his deputy, as every precaution had
been ued. The fact that it is prac
tically impossible for a person to op
en the dark cell door from th inside,
even though unlocked, deepens the
mystery. Wednesday evening The,
