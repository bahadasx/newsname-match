More Party Doctrine Expounded
by the Leaders of the
Party in Convention.
ST. LOvVs*"j un"? 15'"-Still flred
with the enthusiasm ft red up yesterday
hv thh Irm-tlAfo ennunj. <>'
Governor Glynn, of New York, on
Americanism, preparedness, peace
and prosperity, delegates today
crowded Into the Coliseum where the
Democratic national convention is being
held to hoar more party doctrine
expounded by leaders of the Democracy.
While the sub-committee of the
resolutions committee was engrossed
In Its work of platform building the
program culled for the permanent organization
of the convention, another
keynote speech to be delivered by the
permanent chairman and the delivery
of addresses by well known leaders
In the party. Delegates were prepared
to stir up things with even
more enthusiasm than yesterday.
Nearly every delegate was provided
grith an American llag, aud some had
loisc making devices.
No change is expected in the program
to nominate President Wilson
late Friday night. Some of the delegates
expressed a desire that the
convention nominate its candidate
tonight but members of the resolutions
committee pointed out that tiie
platform will not be ready for the
consideration of the convention until
I probably Friday morning. Those delegates
who urged that the convention
wind up its work Thursday night
said they felt it was a mistake to
hold the convention in session a day
longer when it was definitely known
who would be nominated.
William A. Glasgow, Jr.. the Pennsylvania
member of the rules committee,
may offer a resolution in the
convention providing that the nomination
of President Wilson he made
^ the order of business at 8 o'clock toA
Bight.
The gathering of the convention
Crowd today was not as spectacular
as yesterday when the suffragists enlivened
the occasion and lent much
color to the scene. But the assemblage.
If anything, was larger, many
fortunate ticket holders who did not
' desire to see the preliminaries of
opening a national convention being
I on hand to hear the expected ora
\ tory.
The delegates hoped for cooler
weather. Because of the limited size
of the oval shaped auditorium, the
delegates have been allotted only sixteen
inches of space for seats and in
consequence the crowding coupled
with the warm weather of yesterday,,
made things uone too comfortable.
' T ASSOCIAftD
COLISEUM. ST. I.ons. June 15.?
I' Eleven o'clock. the hour for the convention
to be in order, passed with the [
Coliseum only partly filled. Very few .
of the delegates were in their seats
and none of the lenders had arrived.
The band entertained the small crowd
while the rules committee had a meeting
to talk over the proposal to proceed
with the nominations tonight instead
of tomorrow night.
The band played the anti-hyphen
song. "Don't Bite the Hand That's
Feeding You." and a male quartet sang
the chorus. The crowd liked it and
cheered.
The committee on permanent organization
at a meeting meanwhile formally
named Senator Ollle James, of
Kentucky, as permanent chairman; J.
Bruce Kramer, of Montana, permanent
secretary: E. E. Britton, of North
Carolina, permanent associate secretary;
John I. Martin, of St. I>ouis. permanent
BerseanVat-arms, and recommended
that nl! other temporary officers
of the convention be made permanent.
William J. Bryan cot his usual reception
when ho took his place in the
press stand. Delegates and galleries
joined in cheers and applause.
A soloist 'n the band stand sane

Convention lenders let it he known
they favored making nominations tonight
whether or not the platform wa?
completed and the committee on)
rules voted unanimously to recommend
to the convention that nominations
be made at 8 o'clock tonight.
Ni np ronvenuon innnnK?*rs ann ojticers
of the national committee deWff
clared their confidence that the plan
would go through. It was welcome!
newa to many of the delegntes who
have not relished remaining until
Saturday. The plan to adopt the
platform after the nomination had i
been made as was done in Baltimore j
y four years ago was counted on to fulV
fill the promises of the managers
to the city of St. bonis for a four dayconvention.
