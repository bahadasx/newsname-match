BACCALAUREATE
The importance of the Jiaccalaureate
night to the minds of many was em
phasized last Sunday evening when
the large auditorium room of the M. 10.
church was filled to capacity.
Bouquets of llowers decorated the
altar, lending to the scene the soft
beauty and charm that only (lowers
can.
At the last stroke of the bell, the
organ, played by Mrs. Staley began a
march, accompanied by Prof. Sturgis
and ltonald Toft with violins and
lidith Toft with comet. The graduates,
twenty-four in number, were ushered
to front seats in waiting for them, also
the members of the school board and
the faculty.
Hev. Uradiield gave the invocation
and a beautiful anthem was sung by
the combined Presbyterian and Metho
dist choirs. During the offering the
orchestra gave the audience a treat
with a line selection.
The text chosen by Hev. (leach for
the Baccalaureate 6ermon to the young
people just leaving Yale high school,
was most appropriate and offered food
for deep thought to both young and
old. It was taken from Romans 12: 2,
and reads as follows: "And be not
conformed to this world; but be ye
transformed by the renewing of your
mind, that ye may prove what Is that
good, and acceptable, and perfect, will
of God."
We would like to give the sermon
word for word to our readers, but that
is scarcely possibly. However, so many
heard the splendid thoughts, the ex
cellent version and the fine application
that it is not necessary to say more
than that everyone enjoyed and was
benefitted by the address.
After a quartette sung in good style
by Prof. Sturgis. Harold Hallman,
Mrs. Clyde Adams and Verna Hallman,
the congregation was dispersed witn
the benediction.
Junior Banquet.
Another annual banquet given by
the Juniors in honor of the Seniors has
come and gone and the worthy Juniors
are congratulating themselves on the
success in every particular of this one
of 1916.
Tables were set in the dining room
of the, Presbyterian church and one
hundred ten persons participated in the
banquet, all admiring the beauty of
the decorations of tables and room it
self. Spirea with its pure white blos
soms and Jananese honeysuckle with
its beautiful pink coloring were used
with a lavish hand and with the pretty
costumes of the guests, the whole com
bined with charming effect.
At wight o'clock all were seated and
everyone enjoyed the three course feast.
It was noticeable that there was no
stiffness or formality, as is quite often
the case in these functions, everyone
doing his or her best to be free and to
make his neighbor happy and at ease.
After the banquet punch was served
and the following toasts were respond
ed to with our esteemed superintendent
JN.J.Drouyor in his natural capacity
of toastmaster, introduced by the pres
ident of the Junior class, Donald Mc-
mtyre.
The toasts were the best ever, so say
the hearers, anyway, they were extra
good and the Jokes caused much mer
riment. The Seniors Helen Farley

the Ionia Sentinel:
"The new owners, K. W. Kralnbrink
and Clare L. Fuller, have for many
years been closely identified with De
troit's largest wholesale and retail jew
elry store, Mr. Krainbrink as secretary
and Mr. r uller as treasurer. They are
both hustlers, come highly recommend
ed, are of the broad guage type of men,
and will prove a great addition to Ion
ia's business men. .
They will continue the same cour
teous and upright treatment that has
always been accorded by the outgoing
proprietors and a square deal to all is
assured."

July 4th Will be a Big Day Here
Make Plans to Attend.
The committees in charge of the 4th
of July program have certainly turned
the trick and have as tine a list of
events scheduled as were ever pulled
off in Yale. Bills and programs will
be out this week.
The list of athletic sports is excep
tionally large, consisting of running,
jumping, and many funny stunts.
In the afternoon a fast base ball
game will be played. The Anker
Holths, Port Huron's fastest playing
team will cross bats with the Yale
Boosters, and a good game is assured
lovers of the National game.
Good speakers have been secured
for the occasion and it is expected that
City park will house on that day one
of the largest crowds that ever visited
Yale.
Music will be furnished during the
day by McKanlass' band of Port
Huron.
Meals will be served on the grounds
also refreshments of all kinds.
The day's doings will close with
grand display of fireworks in the
evening.
It is none too early to begin planning
for the National holiday, and while
you are doing so, plan to come to Yale
we will pubiien me complete pro
gram later.
Work of County Agriculturist
Two important meetings were at
tended last week. On Tuesday after
noon a talk on the relationship between
the county agent and the farmer was
lven at the meeting of the Gleaner
"ederation at Thornton. This consti
tuted the first opportunity that has pre
sented itself for meeting with the
Gleaners, and it afforded much pleasure
and encouragement to be able to work
with them. It perhaps would not be
too much to Bay that the Farmers'
Clubs and Granges, in addition to be
ing excellent support for the county
agent movement, have been strengthen
ed themselves through their co-operation
in the work, and it is believed that
with the Gleaners also the benefits will
be mutual. About one hundred fifty
persons were present, and the Interest
shown made it one of the best meet
lngs I have attended since coming to
the county.
Thursday was spent with the Union
Farmers' Club at the home of Daniel
loley in Emmett township where the
subject of Livestock Record and Co
operative Marketing Associations was
discussed. These seemed to be ques
tions of vital interest to those present
as it resulted in a lively discussion and
the attitude shown indicates that con
ditlona are becoming very favorable
for accomplishing something in the
way of marketing farm products co
operatively.
A discussion of stock feeding and
methods of i alanclng rations Monday
afternoon completed the work with the
county rsormai Class, nans lor car
rying out some demonstrations in re
gard to testing seeds and soils and the
operation ot the Babcock test in con
nection with the schools were also dis
cussed with the prospective teachers.
It seems reasonable that the older boys
and girls in the country schools could
learn to do considerable work along
these lines
Wednesday was spent at the meeting
of the National Holstein Association
at Detroit. This is one of the largest
Live Stock Record Associations in ex
istence, and anorded an excellent op
portunity for Michigan people to get
first information in regard to these in
stitutions which have made it possible
to improve the live stock of the country
and bring it to the high standard of
today.
The canning demonstrations which
will be held next week seem to be
about the best appreciated venture that
has yet been undertaken, and the indi
cation, and the indications are very
good for a large attendance. These
will be held as follows:
Mrs. Johu Patterson, Columbus town
ship Monday, June 19, at 2 P. M.
Mrs. Wm. Campbell, Lynn township,
Tuesday, June 20, at 9 A. M.
Huston Hall, Allenton, Tuesday,
June 21, at 9 A. M.
The Gleaner Hall, China township,
Wednesday, June 21 at 9 A. M.
There are some prospects of getting
some girls' canning and, gardening
c1ovjs started also, and all who are in
terested, whether young or old, should
arrange to attend.
C. L. Brody, County Agent
CALEDONIAN DAY
Some day during the week of July
24th the Scotch lads and lassies of Yale
and vicinity will put on a day of real
old time Caledonian sports. They will
enliven the occasion with pipers and
dancers and it will be a red letter day
for our little city. We hope to be able
to give the exact date and more par
ticulars next week.
GLYCERINE AND BARK
PREVENT APPENDICITIS
The simple mixture of buckthorn
bark, glycerine, etc., known as Adler-
l-ka, astonishes 1 ale people. Because
Adler-I k acts on BOTH lower and
upper bowel, ONE SPOONFUL re
lieves almost AN Y CASE constipation,
sour stomach or gas. It removes such
surprising foul matter that a few doses
often relieve or preyent appendicitis.
A short treatment helps chronic stom
ach trouble. The INSTANT, easy
action of Adler-I ka is astonishing.
