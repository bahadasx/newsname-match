F. \-(,overnor Martin H. (ilynn,
temporary chairman of tho Pemo
cratic National Convention, snundcd
il al tha tirst Bsaakm in tha Caaiaaun
thia morning, in a speech hearing
the approval of President Wilson.
Moderate enthusiasm was shown hy
tho delegates, who listencd patiently
and fanned themselves vigorous.y
with hupc palm leaves. and a d"al of

who by no means tillcd the balconirs.
Official denial was made that
President Wilson would come here
Saturday, at the. request of Pindell.
of Peoria, and Senator Saulsbury. of

and blazon forth a keynote himself.
The convention schedule now
itands: Permanent orpanization,

speeches. Friday night. Nominations

i has a twofold purpose?to keep faith
] with the hotelkeepers, who demand
a four-day convention, and tn satisfy
! the superstitious. who have been in

Elaborate explanation of his key

"Americanism." as interpreted by
Democracy, is the rrood old policy of
neutrality and isolation. "Peace and

proceed to beat up a war with the
