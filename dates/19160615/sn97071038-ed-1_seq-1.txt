BALL GAME SUNDAY
Condon Meets 10 to 6 Defeat in Game
Here Hcner Meets lone Next
Sunday In What Promises To
Be Best Event of Season
Heppner won its first game of the
three It has played, since the season
opened, in this city Sunday. The
most pleasant feature of the occasion
centered in the fact that it was our
old rival, Condon who look the drub
bing, and although the game was not
as closely contested as former ones
when these two teams have met there
was just enough of the spectacular
pulled at various stages to make the
game one of great interest for the
funs. Each team got a home run
to its credit, Fulwider of Heppner
pulling one of the longest drives of
the season in the second inning, and
bringing one man in besides himself
while Charlie Fltzmaurice came in
for his regular four ply swat, but it
was ill timed, there being no one on
at the time..
Fulwider struck out 11 Condon
batters, held them down to 8 hits and
6 runs. On the other side, Fitzmau
rice and Olds were hit for 14 safe
ones and struck out only 6. Heppner
made 10 runs.
O'Rourke and Rogers officiated as
umpires and George Pearce was score
keeper. The biggest crowd of the
season attended the same.
Arrangements which were under
way for bringing Arlington to Hepp
ner next Sunday had to be given up
for the reason that the Columbia
river team has disbanded for the sea
son. This game will be supplement
ed with one between the locals and
lone. These two teams never fail to
give a good exhibition of the national
game and the fans can reasonably ex
pect something doing when they get
together next Sunday. Both teams
will be greatly strengthened on that
clay and a close game is looked for.

The streams of Morrow and Gil
liam counties will receive in the
neighborhood of 280,000 young trout
in the near future, according to Rob
ert H. Young, of the Morrow County
Rod & Gun Club, who recently re
turned from Portland where he con
ferred witn the members of the State
Game and Fish Commission. The
majority of these fish will be placed
In Willow and Rock creeks.
It is the plan to have both cars
brought to Heppner, since only 15,
000 of the fish will be planted in
Gilliam county, with the exception of
Rock creek. It Is easier to stock this
stream from Heppner than from Con
don, inasmuch as most of the fish will
be taken well up on Rock creek.
It will be necessary to get the fish
out to the streams at the earliest pos
sible moment after their arrival. To
do this, many owners of cars must
donate their time and service. It is
estimated by members of the local
Rod and Gun Club that it will take
at least thirty automobiles to deliver
the fish to the various creeks.

METHODS OF HAYING
By J. E. Larson, Field Agronomist,
O. A. C.
The annual hay crop of Oregon has
a value of from fifteen to eighteen
million dollars. It is one of the big
items in the total crop production of
the state. Hay is a more or less con
stant figure in all systems of farm
ing. It is indeed a rery important
crop in any system of dairy or live
stock farming. Much land not suit
able for cultivation would give good
returns in pasture or bay crops. The
wet weather and drought do not effect
it as much as they do grain crops.
Once the seeding is done and a stand
has been secured, the crop may be
grown with very little trouble to the
farmer..
It has been determined that the
stage of maturity at which grass is
cut has much to do with not only the
yields but, the palatability and nutri
tive value of the hay as feed. The
method of curing has its effect, es
pecially in the manner in which stock
will relish the hay and in the actual
feeding value of the same. It is safe
and conservative to say that under
present conditions and by the present
practices followed out that at least
twenty-five to forty percent of the
feeding value of the hay is lost in
the cutting and curing. Getting the
hay wet and burning it in the sun
iostroys Its feeding value. To be
sure, when it comes to market hay,
the question of weeds and mixtures
affect the value of the hay crop; yet,
if it is properly cut and cured, its
feeding value is not injured material
ly. The problem which is giving the
most concern and is of greatest
moment at this time is the subject of
haymaking, or "cutting and curing of
hay."
We have in Oregon a great variety
of plants cut for hay, each of which
presents a different problem in the
subject of cutting and curing.' In gen
eral, if hay is cut too soon or too
green, a light, washy hay will result
and oftentimes even sours and loses
in palatability and aroma. On the
other hand, if delayed until past the
proper stage a coarse unpalatable
and ludigestnble produce will result.
It also makes-Some difference as to
the class of live stock which you are
preparing this hay for. Hay for
dairy cows and sheep should be cut a
little on the grqen side; that is,
rather earlier than later than the
stage described herein. If the prod
uct is for beef or for horses that aro
to deliver energy or power, tha hays
are allowed to get somewhat more
mature with better results. If we are
to ge the most out of the hay crop we
must cut it and cure it especially for
the class of stock we are to feed it to
or cut it at the best stage for the
market to which we must cafer.
Clover is widely grown in Western
Oregon. It presents one of the big
gest problems we have in haymaking.
The time of cutting will depend a
EARLY PIONEER PASSES
Mntildu (Boord) Ayers Crossed the
Tilling in 1802.
Mrs. Matilda Caroline (Boord)
Ayers was born at Independence, 111.,
November 26, 1S3G and died at her
home in Heppner June 10, 1916.
She wus married to Mr. Ayers in
IS 58 and as a result of this union
there were five children, two of whom
with her husband, preceded her. The
other three, Mrs. R. Y. Currln of Pay
etto, Idaho, Alfred Ayers and Mrs. S.
W. Spencer of Heppner were all at
her bedside when she departed. Al
though nearly 80 years old, she had
been remarkably healthy, never, I
think, since she was married, had
been in bed but very little till the
last illness, which lasted only about
one week. She remained conscious
to the end, giving directions about
keep-sakes which she wanted each to
have. The last 25 years of her life
were spent at this place.
She was converted when quite
young and joined the Methodist
church; and was a faithful member
and a consistent Christian till the
last.
Her funeral was preached by the
writer, at the M. E. Church, south,
June 11, at 2:30 p. m., from the text
Num. 23-10. The body was laid to
rest by a large number of friends and
sympathizers, to await the ressurec
tion morn.

WOOL SALES
WILL
LOCAL WAREHOUSES ON SATURDAY
The wool sales will be held at the
warehouses in this city next Satur
day, according to schedule. In pre
vious years it sometimes happened
that the sales were called off, after
they had been announced, for the
reason that all clips were disposed of
at private sales. However, this year
there remains a larger part of the
1916 clip to be sold, so the sale will
take place In the usual manner.
Several clips already sold indicate
that the price which the growers will
receive this year will exceed any pre
vious year by a big margin. Thos.
Ross, of Echo, buying for the Boston
great deal upon what we expect to do
with the second crop of clover. If
we are after a seed crop it is usually
best to pasture back or cut back the
field abdut May 1 to 10th. These
clippings at this time can scarcely he
cured for hay but if there is sufficient
growth they may be put into the silo
and the clover crop allowed then to
mature for a seed crop. On lands that
are not inclined to- dry out badly, it
is often possible to get a light crop of
hay, allowing the clover to head out,
then remove this and allow the seed
crop to come afterwards. However,
if we are after a hay crop primarily,
it is best to let the clover pass the
full bloom and cut when one-third of
the blossoms are turning brown. At
this time, we have practically all
there will be in the clover plant and
yet it has not deteriorated materially.
At this time, it carries the least wa
ter content up until this stage and
will cure more readily. If cured at
this stage without getting dusty, it
makes very good supplemental hay
for horses. If it Is cut for cows alone
it may be cut slightly earlier, say
when the heads are all In full bloom.
The same may be said of alsiks clover
except that we. cannot depend on a
crop of hay and a crop of seed. If a
crop of seed alone is to be harvested,
it is well to simply pasture back a
while in the spring or clip as for red
clover. If anything, do not allow the
alsike to get as mature as the red
clover for if it is at all over-mature
it dries out and becomes fluffy and
does not have the highest feeding
value.
Vetch Is another .legume crop
grown quite extensively for soiling
and hay purposes. It Is usually grown
with a grain crop for hay. The proper

firm of Crimmins & Pierce, bought up
several lots of wool in this vicinity
the past week. The price paid for
tine wool was around 25 cents with
indications of growing stronger, ac
cording to market reports. He paid
as high as thirty cents for coarse
wool.
The sale which is being held at Pi
lot Rock today will indicate, some
what, the price which will be offered
to local growers, although in pa3t
years the prices paid in Heppner have
been higher than those recived by
growers in the neighboring towns.
Nearly all the interior wool has
been hauld in and the growers have
already begun to arrive for the sales
day.
stage at which the vetch crop should
be cut for hay is when the first seeds
are forming in the pods. This will
mean that pods will be formea on the
upper stem and the extreme ends will
still be In blossom. The grain crop
should be about the milk or soft
dougb stage at this time. This crop,
too, may be retarded in its maturity
by pasturing off with stock in the
early spring after the ground has set
tled. There is nothing gained by try
ing to get both vetch hay and vetch
seed in the same crop. If you aro go
ing to . cut it for hay, cut it at the
above-mentioned stage.

NEWSY NOTES FROM IONE
Mrs. Bert Mason, accompanied by
Mrs. Cynthia Walker, motored to
Heppner Saturday to do some shop
ping. l B. Sperry, wheat buyer and feel
dealer, went to Portland Tuesday to
spend the balance of the week look
ing after business.
J. E. Cronan was up from Portland
the first of the week, returning home
on Tuesday. He made a trip to Con
don while here.
Ben Buschke and wife were in
from the Rhea creek ranch on Sat
urday. Mr. Buschke fs feeling good
over his crop prospects and will have
a big lot of grain to market this fall.
The abundant cherry crop at this
place is ripening fast and the robins
are getting very busy as a conse
quence. The birds are all right, but
they do handle the cherry crop in a
rough way. .
The majority of those attending
the Rose show and other attractions
in Portland the past week from this
place, have returned. The tourists
are also wending their way home to
the country beyond, and many are the
cars passing through lone from day
to day.
The I. O. O. F. lodge at this place
are arranging to restore their build
ing, recently damaged by fire. It is
likely that the old structure will be
entirely removed and a new frame
building put up. This has not been
determined as yet, however, and will
be settled when the estimates of cost
have been gone over by the lodge.
Frank M. Smith and family on
their way from Laramie, Wyo., to
Portland, were Btranded in lone for
a few days this week owing to car
trouble, the first experienced on the
entire trip, and he says this was
caused by "dragging" a fellow Jravel
er out of the ditch over in the Blue
mountains. Numerous crippled ma
chines are compelled to put in at the
garage here and that line of work is
on the boom.
xne past week nas heen some
warm; just the proper kind of weath
er to bring the crops 'along and the
field are showing much good deve.
opment. It is pleasing to note what
splendid improvement there has been
in the crop prospects during the past
fornight, and there Is no doubt but
that we shall see a splendid harvest
in this neck o' the woods. To be sure
we are not advertising a bumper crop
for the conditions during the past
year have not been just right for that.
It is gratifying, also, to know that the
prospects throughout the wheat belt
of Morrow county are far in advance
of our more unfortunate neighbors if
the reports of those who have had the
opportunity of seeing can be relied
upon. It is getting time that we are
"coming back" in this respect; our
folks need the revenue.
Rural Credit Law Would Lower
Rates Ono-Third.
A reduction of one-third of the
present interest rates in farm loans
would be secured by the proposed
rural credits measure, the initiative
petition for which is now ready for
circulation.
Other features in its favor, as en
umerated by C. E. Spence, Master of
the Oregon State Grange, in a com
munication to the Oregon Grange
Bulletin, are as follows:
It harmonizes with the proposed
federal legislation for rural credits,
which it would supplement.
It is self-operating, requiring no
additional administrative expense, go
ing into the hands of the State Land
Board consisting, of the Governor,
Secretary of State and State Treas
urer, which has handled successfully
the state school. funds of $6,000,000.
It adds nothing to the taxpayer's
burden, since all operating costs are
to be borne by the borrower.
Bonds for obtaining the loan funds
can be marketed at lower rates than
farm mortgages, while at the same
time the state merely "goes security"
for which it is amply protected by
mortgages on land at double the val
ue of the loan.
Farmers of Oregon are compelled
to compete in world markets with
farmers having a much lower credit
rate, and until this condition is reme
died the state will not advance as It
should.
It is necessary to get 25,000 signa
tures on the petitions within the pres
ent month. Since no funds are avail
able for circulating them reliance is
to be placed on volunteer help. Those
wishing petitions to circulate may se
cure them by writing C. E. Spence,
Oregon City, or J. D. Brown, Arlington.

veterinarians visit Morrow county
and stay there for a period sufficient
ly long to determine just the nature
of the epidemic known as walking
disease in your county.
I am trying to have a vacine made
