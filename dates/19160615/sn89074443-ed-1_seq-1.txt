The eminent gentleman who edits the Courier-News stumbled
onto the truth the other day—and printed it. He says there, are no
very rich, men in North Dakota. He is right about that—they
don't five here. They make their money and get outl
How foolish it would be for a Morgan, a Hill, a Rockefeller, to
stick around North Dakota—especially in the winter time! North
Dakota isn't a summer resort. Nobody plays golf here. What
would the very rich do here to amuse themselves Not e\ren an
occasional ten-thousand-dollar-poodle-dog banquet.,7 \i

Ex-president Worst showed us that North Dakota farmers
were losing fifty-five million dollars a year on the by-products of
wheat alone. This goes to the very rich men who do not live in
North Dakota, yet control the business of the state.

But many business men and city voters do not understand the real purpose of this farmers'

Yes, Doctor, you are right. We have no very rich men here,

half a hundred millionaires a year.
It was to stop as much of this robbery as possible that the

farmers, insofar as they can organize and retain this wealth, will
