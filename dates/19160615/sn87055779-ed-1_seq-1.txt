SUFFRAGISTS IN

Tangling !G electoral votes in 12
states that can be thrown ihe one
vay or the other by '..7 per cent of
tlie voting population, as the stake,
three groups of suffrage women are
making the prettiest light in the
long story of woman's struggle for
the ballot before the platform com
mittee of the democratic party.
On the one hand they offer a
promise of leading the party to the
pot of gold at the end of the po
litical rainbow.
On the other they offer a threat
of pulling- down the contempt of
western states upon a recalcitrant
democracy if. indeed, it shall .o
prove in the eyes of the worr.en.
The f;ht broke in all of its pic
turesquo effects before the session of
trie platform committee? that, ended
this morning the first round of the
struggle over the code of principles
rpon which democracy is going be
fore the people. Put this is no story
cf the party reed, save in so far as
it applies purely to women. It is a
narrative of the invasion made by
the women upon the wise of the po

Praises Underwood-Simmons

Handling of Foreign
Situation.
Ii.teni.itioiial News Service:
ST. LOFIS. Mo., June l.V The
ability of the Wilson administration
to keep tlie country at pe-ace with
out sacrificing the national honor,
together with the enactment of ben
eficial legislation will be written
boldly on the pages e.f histe.ry ele
elared Ollie M. James of Kentufliy
in his address today as permanent
chairman of the eb-mocratic national
convention.
"During three years of its national
control." said Sen. James, "demo
cracy has enacted into law more
progressive remedical legislation
than the nation has ever had writ
ten upon its statute leoks since its
birth. In former national contests
in the. last two decades our party
came as a prophet. Today we come
with deeds, not words; with perfor
mance, not promise. The democra
tic party has kept its word with the
American people. We have made
good."
Sen. James went over the things
that have been accomplished by the
democrats in putting new and het
ier laws upor. the legislative rec
ords of the country. Pres't Wilson's
foreign policy was commended. The
chairman poimed out that the dem
ocrats had eric Cted a tariff law un
der which monopolies have been
curbed and a great prosperity at
tained; a banking law which makes
panics no longer possible and takes
the money to control out of the
hands of an oligarchy. He review
eil other reform measures of lesser
importance that have been passed V
the Wilson administration.
Praise For Wilson.
Pres't Wilson "neither bullies the
weak nor fears the strong" was the
statement of the chairman in dis
cussing th1 adminisration's policy
toward the belligerents of Europe
and the troubled conditions in Mexi
co. In making a final appeal for
putting patriotism above polities.
Chairman James said that the re
nomination of such a pre-sielent in
partisan convention ought not to be
ne-ce-ssary and that to discredit liim
might interfere greatly when Euro
pean nations cease their hostilities
and make ready te sign the treaty
that will bring peace te the world.
Sen. James touched lightly on the
president's campaign against hibby
ing in congress. He ,aid that during
the present administration the con
stitution hail been amended for the
first time since the Civil war by al
lowing the people- to name their sen
ators at the polls. He said the Fn-derwood-Simmons
tariff act was an
aeceunplishment ef the administra
tion ef which tlie party ceu!d be
justly proud.
Pednts t I ros polity.
"Not a schedule in it fosters a
monoply." said the ehairman. "Our

with idle - men. produce a panic,
create soup houses and distress

The democratic national convention todav ordered that its
candidates for president and vice-president shall be nomin

tonight. It perfected its permanent organization, listened
to the speech of U. S. Sen. Ollie M. James and joinrd in
two distinct demonstrations, one of which unexpectedly
was made an ovation for William Jennings Bryan.
Th tommit.ee had dceide-d that
the eiriginal program was to he ad

the committee was making up its
mind that this should be tlie pro

After the situation had be-en ex
plained by .1. I'.ruee' Kremer. secre
tary of the convention, who was
directed to present the position of
the leaders to the committee, it was
decided to change its plans and fol

The committee em permanent or

that body through its chairman. W.
