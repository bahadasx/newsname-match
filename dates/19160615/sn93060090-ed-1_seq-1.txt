Reader are you willing to
said to us there should' be V Highway and'
see if they a Way. This makes Two Ways
world has! for tbe people of God and of
Christ to walk tin. The first
question that should be asked, is
this. Why is there Two Wayi?
Prom the fact, that there is
two classes of people, the one
called Israelite or Jews, and
the other the Gentiles, or heath
ens, And the origination of
them both, came in tbe following
manner. As we have often told
in tbe Cresset heretofore But
now again. The first Way that
we Bhall take up I the Highway
As our Text says, ' And there
shall be a Highwaj there, please

"And there shaft be an high
way for tbe. remnant of bis peo
ple, which shall be left, from
Assyria; like a it was to Israel
ia tbe day that be- came up out
of the land of Egypi." (11-10,)
This- scripture .explains itself
for the Highway shall be- just
like it was to tbe children of
Israel when they came up out of
the lajd of Bgjpv And- that

Hard lo Understand.
TEXT
He that refuseth instruction
despirtra tiia own soul; but be
that hearetb reproof getteth
understanding. (Prov. 1532.
We have been co:ng all we
can for over twenty- years to
" give to the peoplo the Instruc
tions of the word of God. And
our Text teach us, that any one'
who will not recieve instructions
he wrongs bis own soul.
And why they will wrong
their on soul is more than we
'. can understand, unless we apply
the word that says 'The rich
man's wealth in his strong City
and as a high wall in bis own
; conceit." Ob, bow sad to think
head them for they do not tell
you to come with a hip. bip
hurrah, you must come with
weeping and.' with mourning,
Por tbe Assembley must be
sollem. And tbe tbe hardest
thing to understand is wby.peo'
p'e will up with that which will
send their souls in to torment
in the place of taking up . with
tbe truth.
A Highway
And a Way.
TEXT:
"And an highway sball be
there and a way, and it shall be
called, The way of holiness; the
unclean shall not pass over it.
but it sball be for those: tbe
wayfaring men though, fools
sball not err therein,'1 Isa, 35
8.) , ..
For tbe benefit of our Readers
and Friends, we shall once more
write upm,, the Two Ways pre
sented in bur Text, and before
we conclude or in other words,
in connection with those Two
Ways, spoken of in our Text
we shall speak of the broad Way
that lead down to death and
hell, or a lake of fire and brim
stone which is the second death.
And we trust that our Read
ers will closely watch our work,
For our labors are intended for
their ' Eternal welfare. Some
may think that it is but one way
given to the human family to
worship God, since Christ died
But we must say that this be
lief has sprung from a miscon
struction of the Pure Word of
God. ' And that too, from tbe
craftiness placed in men's heart
by the serpent, the old devil, For
under the law of Moses, then
this Highway is the Mosaics!
law as tbe Highway spoken of
in our Text, which is one of the
two ways spoken of, as the
Highway and the Way.
ADd again it is prophesied of
in these words:
"The word of the Lord came
unto me again, saying.
Also, thou son of -man, appoint
tbee two ways that the sword of
the king of Babylon may come;
both twain shall coiiiC forth out
of one land, and choose thou a
place, choose it at tbe head of
the way to the city," (Ezek. 21
19
Here is the two Ways spoken
of in plain terms thw Highway
andthWay. And we buv.c a-
bov8Ct forth the Highway and,,
now we shall let the reader know
from a scriptural standpoint the
the way. For tbe first proof,
please?, read;
Jesus sai:h onto .him. I am
the way. tbe truth, and the life;
no man cometb unto tbe Father
but by me. (St John HG
Christ ' says that, "he is
the way" This then give9 us
the proof of the 2nd. way "the
way, of holyness, We have yet a
nother scripture we wish to
present to our readers so that
they may know that there is
two ways set forth in the word.
And tbat too, besides - tbe way
of the world, the way which
Satan controls, This way ia pre
sented to us in this mannar,
''The Lord will destroy tbe
house of the prcud; but he will
establish the border of the
window. (Prov 1625
Here is tbe third way, And it
is a way that these is thousands
who are professed Christians
that are in this way. And will
be last. ? Ob dear readers do
consider these scriptures in
their true light, that you may be
able to observe all. things which
