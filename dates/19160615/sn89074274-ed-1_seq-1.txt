VOL. XXXVII—NO. 7. (Official County Paper)
Country life Given
Emphasis at Normal
"Back to the Farm," a comedy in
three acts, was presented by a cast
of students in the Normal school au
ditorium Saturday morning as a cul
mination of a series of addresses and
programs devoted during the week to
the country life movement. The pro
gram of the week was arranged by the
departments of education, agriculture
and rural school studies. Miss Mar
tha E. Dewey directed the cast that
appeared Saturday morning.
This 'well-known comedy was given
local color and presented with much
good effect. Merton Merrill, dissatis
fied with the humdrum monotony of
farm life done after the old-fashioned
methods, has a break with his father
and on the advice of a visiting friend
leaves the farm to enroll at the Val
ley City State Normal school. There
he learns new methods and uptodate
ways of doing things, works for his
board and room and in addition man
ages to accumulate a .handsome bank
account.
He hears little from home and that
is discouraging. His father is ill,
there is no crop and the mortgage is
due. He manages to satisfy the mort
gage, however, with his savings and
finally goes back to operate the farm
on modern lines. Instead of the dirty
milkman, of the first act, the last act
shows the dairyman in white, the
Babcock tester, the hired man, the
hired girl and all signs of prosperity.
In the meantime the schoolma'm has
also taken a course in the Normal
school and goes back to take charge of
the school in the Merrill district.
Soon she marries Merton, and they
send to Valley City for another school
teacher. In the meantime, the dairy
man also marries the hired girl and
peace and harmony and prosperity
rule the day, where poverty and mis
management once ran riot.

Teacher as a Leader."
BIG FLAX AREA BEING PLANTED
There will be a very heavy acreage
of flax in the western section of the
state this year, according to Dean
Wiley, of Dickinson. This fact has
been brought about through the belat
ed seeding operations resulting from
the extended rains this spring.
Four big tracts of flax, aggregating
several thousand acres, are being sown
south of Southheart. The work is be
ing done with traction outfits—these
outfits, on one of the farms—being
sufficient to plant a total of 40 acres
in a single day.
Crop conditions are very satisfac
tory on the slope at the present tinr
The weather recently has been favor
able to the crops, which are firmly
rooted, and because of the adequate
moisture supply now on hand, should
be in position to withstand the hot
weather period in splendid shape. The
wheat acreage is smaller than usual—
but the total acreage of small grains
is greater than last year.
MINOT WHITE SLAVER
GETS 15 YEARS IN PEN
Fargo, June 11— M. C. Williams, con
victed by a jury in federal court yes
terdav of white slavery on two counts,
was yesterday afternoon sentenced to
15 years in the federal penitentiary at
Fort Leavenworth. He will be taken
there some time early this week.
Williams was arrested at Minot last
winter together with a woman. The
woman was later released and Wil
liamB bound over to the grand jury.
The case came up for trial Friday.
District Attorney M. A. Hildreth rep
resented the government.
The grand jury has completed its
work for this term, 36 true bills having
been turned in. Several of these
cases are said to be of considerable
importance.
PURCHASES FINE ANIMAL
T. H. Bruns, one of the progressive
farmers of Noltimier township, ex
emplified the "buy at home" spirit by
recently purchasing a pure bred Red
Poll bull from the herd of V. E.
Grant, of Cuba. Mr. Bruns intends to
establish a herd of this famous breed
of cattle, and in so doing is pursuing
the right course. It is a noteworthy
fact that farmers in general are tak
ing more interest in live stock,, and we
are glad to publish news items of this
kind, knowing that more and better
live stock is greatly needed on the
average North Dakota farm.

fair. The attendance was large, many

The committee had planned a good
program of entertainment, and some of
the events consisted of horse racing,
foot races, sack race, hop, skip and
jump, etc.
The main event was a baseball game
between Wimbledon and Rogers. This
proved to be an air tight contest, neith
er side being able to score until the
eighth inning. At this juncture rain
commenced to fall, and whether from
this cause or some other the Wimble
don team went to pieces and the Rog
ers bunch rushed over four counters.
They added another in the ninth and
the game went to Rogers by the score
of 5 to 0.
Those present from Valley City re
port that the Leal people used their
visitors handsomely, and should they
make such a gathering an annual af
fair the attendance would increase
with every recurrence.

Macdonald's Interests
Are Well Looked After
Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Flewell, of Leal,
were Valley City callers on Friday.
Auditorium, Chicago, June 10.—The
Progressive national convention, after
four days of tumult with but one pur
pose in view, today nominated Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt for president and
a few hours later listened, without
protest, to a message from Oyster Bay
that he would not "accept at this
time." The convention adjourned at
4:58 o'clock this afternoon.
Declination is Conditional
Colonel Roosevelt's declination was
conditional and it was placed in hands
of the Progressive national committee,
to be held until such time as state
ments to be made by Justice Hughes,
nominee of .the Republican party,
"shall satisfy the committee that it is
for the interest of the country that he
be elected." In event the committee
shall be satisfied that aid should be
given to the Republican party in its
fight against the party now in power,
Colonel Roosevelt's refusal to make
the campaign is to be considered final.
It will then be for representatives of
the Progressive Party to say whether
they will endorse the position taken
by Mr. Roosevelt or whether they will
name another to fight for their party
principles.

Captain John H. Parker of Louisi

the selection being by acclamation.
Colonel Roosevelt's running mate of
four years ago, Governor Johnson, of
California, refused to let his name be
placed before the convention because
of information he had concerning the
intention of Colonel Roosevelt toward
his nomination. Several other names
and, notably that of Raymond Robins,
who was both temrorary and perman
chairman of the convention, were of
fered but not seconded. Prior to the
reading of the message from Oyster
Bay, some minutes were consumed in
drawing from delegates and party sup
porters the usual sinews of war, in
form of voluntary financial contribu
tions.

Most of these men have lived here since

PROGRAM MARKS CLOSING
OF WIMBLEDON SCHOOLS
Wimbledon News: Commencement
week program began last Sunday eve
ning with baccalaureate services at
the Presbyterian church, Rev. J. S.
Miller of the M. E. church preaching
the baccalaureate sermon.
The commencement exercises were
held at Joss' hall on Wednesday eve
ning and were well attended. Miss
Lulu Nutt was the only one who grad
uates from the local high school this
year. She read an excellent paper on
"The Woman of Today."
Rev. C. E. Vermilya of Valley City
delivered the commencement address.
He considered life a progress—a climb
ing toward a goal and the subject of
his Address was, "Some Helps in
liming." He jspoke of the privilege
of searching for truth and that all pro
gress is but the result of discoveries
of new truths. "We have much to
learn from the scholars of the past and
of the present," he said, "but we are
not obliged to take their word as final.
We have the priviledge to investigate
for ourselves and if possible gain new
truths. Nobody ever lived who knew
it all and nobody knows it all now."
He spoke of the need of giving the
largest service possible and in that
way alone would we be able to climb
and make a success. His talk was a
most practical exposition of the phil
osophy of life.
The complete commencement pro
gram was as follows:

Most of the teachers will not be
back next year. It is rumored that
Dan Cupid is making heavy inroads
upon the fair bevy of schoolma'ams.
Whether this is all true or not re
mains to be seen, but it is true that
Miss Hackitt and Miss Anfinson are
the only ones who have promised to
come back next year. Prof. Leufgren,
who has been here for two years, will
also make a change.
WELLS COUNTY FOR PAULSON
Fessenden Free Press: From many
sources comes the information that
voters of the Fifth district are keenly
aware of the short-comings of Judge
Coffey, as disclosed by his work in the
several counties and the great number
of his cases which have been revers
ed by the supreme court, causing ex
tra expense to litigants and to the
counties by re-trials of cases reversed.
They also appear to realize that the
time to make a change is when they
have an opportunity to vote for a ca
pable man. This is the reason for the
sweeping sentiment in favor of A. P.
Paulson for judge of the Fifth district.
This sentiment is known to exist not
only in Wells county but also in a
marked degree in LaMoure, Griggs
and Eddy, and even in Stutsman. In
Barnes county, the home of Mr. Paul
son, he is deservedly popular and will
receive a vote accordingly.
Fingal Herald: Commencement ex
