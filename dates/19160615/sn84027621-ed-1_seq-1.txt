Intends to Renominate Wilson
Its
PBESIDEflT'S SUGGESTIDI13 ARE
Coliseum, St. Louis, June 15. The
Democratic National Convention will
renominate President Wilson and
. Vice President Marshall tonight in
stead of waiting until Friday night
and Saturday morning, if the recom
mendation of the rules committee is
approved by . the convention. The
committee at a meeting which delayed
the opening of the convention, voted
unanimously to recommend making
the nominations at 8 o'clock tonight.
While the convention was adopting
a permanent organization and hear
ing the speech of permanent Chair
man James, the platform makers
worked with President Wilson's "own
draft" and various suggested planks.
It hoped to submit the completed
draft to the full resolutions commit
tee late this afternoon.
Very few delegates were in their
seats when' the hour for opening the
convention arrived. The crowd was
small. The band played the anti-
hyphen song, "Don't Bite the Hand
That's Feeding You." A male quartet
sang a chorus and the crowd cheered
W. J.- Bryan received a noisy re
ception, the band playing the pre
paredness song, "Wake Up America,
as he entered. V
The plank favoring government aid
to terminal warehouses , for storing,
grading and weighing non-perishable
farm products is being considered by
the resolutions committee. It is said
that it would benefit southern cotton
and tobacco growers and western and
northwestern grain growers.
The suffragists. regard the resolu-
tions of the sub-committee drafting
the platform as none too favorable to
them. Only three members are open
ly for suffrage. Democratic leaders
said the committee Were inclined
enough toward suffrage to give it
about the same endorsement as the
republicans. -
A GREAT DEMONSTRATION
There was an eighteen minute dem
onstration when Chairman James re
counted President Wilson's victory in
the German negotiations. He finished
his address at 12:59.

PLEASANT OUTING BY
THE WITHLACOOCHEE
The following party of Ocala and
Birmingham friends, Mrs. Rube Red
ding, Mr. Hall, Mrs. Hall, Miss Hall
and Mr. Rayburn, have returned from
a pleasant several days' outing on the
banks of the famous Withlacoochee"
river. They went out in automobiles
and were joined at the bridge by a
number of friends, who gave them a
royal good time every minute of their
stay. Boating, fishing and picnicking
were pastimes greatly enjoyed by all.
Large trout and bream were caught
in abundance and fried on the banks
cf the river. Ur. Stokes, the famous
fisherman, and a number of young
men, were the lucky fishermen.
While on their jolly outing they also
took in the Inverness picnic which
was a grand success. They were loud
in their praise of the gracious hospi
tality rendered them during they
stay in Inverness. The dinner was
bountiful and delicious and was serv
ed to a queen's taste by the goodj
housewives of Inverness and nearby
towns. The speeches made by the
candidates were eloquent and helped
to make the day one long to be re
membered. Inverness is a thriving lit
tle town in our sister county and has
some stately buildings on the banks
of a lovely lake. The. party enjoyed
sightseeing after the picnic and was
much impressed.

BOARD OF TRADE
Several Matters of Considerable
Moment , Considered at Last
Night's Meeting
At the meeting of the Board of
Trade last night the recent activities
of the organization were recited. An
effort to have the Atlantic Coast Line
railroad retain its night trains thru
here on the Jacksonville, to St. Peters
burg run, and the first payment to
the Florida First Commission for the
national advertising campaign, were
among the matters mentioned.
The Seaboard Air Line in its pro
posed national advertising campaign
will give Ocala space, and in one in
stance to the extent of a full page in
a leading magazine. B. L. Hamner,
recently secretary of the Tampa
board of trade, and now in charge of
the Seaboard's industrial work is.
handling the campaign. Mr. Hamner
recently made a most effective speech
herein behalf of the "Florida First
movement.". w:'-
Secretary Trammell has taken up
with the Gainesville and Leesburg
boards of trade the matter of the
trains on the Coast Line, asking the
co-operation of these organizations.
The first payment to the Florida First
Commission amounted to $343.50, and
has been duly acknowledged.
Mr. Austin Bennett mentioned sev.
eral newspapers in the Middle West
that he" thought would be glad to
publish news items and information
regarding this section, without cost.
He was named a committee of one to
co-operate with the secretary to see
what arrangements could be made in
the matter.
The question of local publicity in
Florida, for the purpose of attracting
-tourists to this section after they are
brought to the state by the Florida
First advertising was discussed. This
matter was referred to the board of
governors with power to act. Col.
Rogers mentioned that he thought it
would be a good thing to try to get
the railroads ; to run . excursions to
Ocala - during the tourist season, se
curing a low rate. - : ;
Mr. S. P. Hollinrake thought it
probable that .the railroads might be
induced to name a tourist's rate to
Silver Springs, but that he did not be-
leve such a rate could be obtained or
Ocala. Mr. Hollinrake was requested
to co-operate with the secretary in an
effort to secure such a rate to Silver
Springs. ' ,;; -';
All persons who attend thV Central
lorida Highway meeting in Oriarido
June 22, from Ocala, will be named as
representatives of the board and the
city of Ocala.

cure all information relative to re
deeming the lot owned by the board
in North Ocala.
Attention was called to the meet
ing pf the local council of the Dixie
Highway to be held in the Board of
Trade rooms tomorrow afternoon.
The proposition of the Radcliffe
Chautauqua of Washington was turn
ed down. Secretary was advised not
to take part in same.

Superintendents of the Coast Line and

J. C. Murchison, division superin

and T. W.. Parsons, division superin

of the council last toight to protest
against the Nash ordinances . to re

sition and North Magnolia streets
and at Fort King and Oklawaha ave
nues. The railroad officials, saying
that they were always ready to pro
vide for the public safety, asked that
the city take no step that would place
an unreasonable burden upon their
roads. They contended that the pres
ent policy of sending a brakeman
ahead of each train moving over a
crossing was the most effective pre
ventive of accidents yet devised, and
expressed a willingness to extend this
policy, now in use here, to all o&the
crossings that the city might think
dangerous. " ' " ?
Mr. Murchison and Mr. Parsons
told the committee that gates were in-,
effective and dangerous, and said that
their installation and operation would
be prohibitive in cost. Mr. Murchison
said that gates at the crossings on
Osceola ' street would be especially
dangerous in view of the fact that
there are .roadways on either side of
the road's tracks, and should the
gates be shut upon a team inside the
result mighe be serious.
The Coast Line official said that his
road had from 15 to 18 crossings
within the city limits, and that to in
stall gates at all of them would cost
from $15,000 to $18,000, and the
operation of each gate would cost
something like $100 a month. A man
would have to be stationed at each
crossing to operate the gates, he said.
Mr. Murchison said that in places hav
ing heavy traffic gates were being
done away with, and he referred to
he policy of the Long Island railroad,
which has probably had more grade
crossing accidents than any road in
the country, and said that this road
had found the gate ineffective, and
was doing away with' it and using
flagmen instead.
Mr. Murchison said that the present
method of handling trains at the
crossings in Ocala had been in use for
a long time, and he said that to his
cnowledge there had been no serious
accident. With regard to the brake
man running ahead of a train, Mr.
Murchison said that the brakeman
was a part of the crew of the train,
that the engineer had to slow his en
gine to allow the brakeman to get off,
and that .the engineer had to keep his
eye on his brakeman and observe hi3
signals. It was pointed out, too, by
Mr. Murchison, that with compara
tively few trains moving through this
city a . stationary watchman at each
crossing would be idle for the greater
part of 24 hours.
"Would you go to an enormous ex
pense to put in a less effective system,
if a more effective system could be J
put in at less expense?" Mr. Mur
chison asked. "The whole thinar in a

"especially toward, the president of

was proclaimed.
ON THE EASTERN FRONT
The Russians have advanced twen
ty miles on Czernowitz, according to
the latest Russian official statement.
Having crossed the Dniester the Slavs
have gained the left bank of the Pruth
river, capturing the town pf Sniatyn,
twenty miles from the capital of
Bukowiha, and nowhere on the front
from the Pripet river, through Gali

there been any cessation of the Rus

Petrograd says the Teutons have

In the eleven days of the drive the
Russians have captured more than
121,000 prisoners, 130 guns and 260

nutshell is: 'Safety first, and economy

Chairman Meffert of the judiciary
committee called - Mr. Murchison's
attention to the fact that the- Coast
Line has been lax in observing the
sp5ed limit with its trains.
"Your trains don't observe the
speed limit," said Mr. Meffert. "They
never have."
"If our trains are not observing the
speed limit, we shall be mighty glad
to have them do so and reduce the
speed if necessary,". Mr. Murchison
replied. . "I would much rather have a
man walk the entire length of the
city before a train than have the
gates."
Councilman Gerig thought South
Third street the most dangerous
crossing on the Coast Line, and that
trains should be flagged there. Mr,
Murchison said that his road would
be glad to take care of this situation
Mr. Parsons of the Seaboard, told
the committee that absolutely the
most effective preventative of acci
dents was a member of a train crew
proceeding before the engine. With
this system, he said, there are as
many flagmen as there are trains.
"The greatest safety is brought
about by reduction of speed," Mr.
Parsons said, referring to the" speed
limit fixed for automobiles.
In Tampa, Orlando, Plant City and
a number of other cities and towns in
the state, where the situation is sim
ilar to that in Ocala, the crossing
problems have been solved by the use
of flagmen, Mr. Parsons said. At

FLAG DAY EXERCISES
Ocala Lodge No. 286, B. P. O. Elks
celebrated Flag Day last evening at
the club house. A good number of
Elks and quite as many ladies were
present.
Exalted Ruler R. S. Rogers and
Mr. Louis Long, who has charge of
the club house, spared no pains to get
the club rooms ready for the occas
ion. Huge American flags draped the
walls of the lodge rooms, halls, ver
anda and reception rooms.
The exercises were held in the
lodge room proper and were very
beautiful and impressive." All of the
officers were at their stations and
Exalted Ruler Rogers presided.
Judge William Gober, in fine voice,
read "The History of Our Flag,"
which was given the closest atten
tion. Judge David S. Williams read,
in a most impressive manner "The
Elks Tribute to the Flag 'one of the
most beautiful tributes to Old Glory
ever wntteen.
The ceremony of placing the. red
roses, the white lilies and the blue
violets, each represented by a huge
bouquet, was conducted by the lead
ing knight, lecturing knight, loyal
knight and esquire. .
After the close of the Flag .Day
exercises, the Elks and their guests
went into the new dining room, where
Mr. Long served a very dainty lunch
of salads, sandwiches, ice cream and
punch.
The visitors and Elks greatly en
joyed the evening and the visitors
were quite enthusiastic over th
pretty manner in which the Elks of
Ocala observed Flag Day, as far as
we know, the only formal observance
of the day in the city.
and there has been no accident. He
said that "he did not recall just the
number of crossings hi3-road has in
Ocala, but thought ten the number.
After hearing the position of the
railroads in the matter, members of
the judiciary committee said that
there would probably be some changes
in the ordinances before they were
passed. The committee will probably
report on the measures at the meet
ing of the council Tuesday night.
Mr. Parsons said he would return
for the meeting of council, but Mr.
Murchison stated a previous engage
ment would prevent his returning.
The judiciary committee meets
again tomorrow night to consider the
plumbing ordinances, affecting the
sewerage system; and it is probable
that the Nash 'gate ordinances, intro
duced for the avowed purpose of re
taliation as a result of the union sta-
lon agitation, will be given further
consideration.
