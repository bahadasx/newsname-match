There are 115 of those completing
the Seventh Grade. This ought to
make a good-sized, class for next
year. For the most part these will
have only the Eighth Grade to pass
on next year, so the most of them
ought to get thru all right. I wish
them success.
But there are a few of those who
tried Who did not succeed. There
are 136 more that took the examina
tions. I hope that they will learn
much more this n&xt year, will not
get so excited on examination day,
and will be successful next spring.
The most of these failures were
caused by short . terms, little equip
ment, and poor teaching. But as all
of these are steadily being Improved
we shall expect fewer failures In the
future.

WOODCRAFT STORIES
FOR LITTLE CHILDREN
Eleventh Story.
By L. Roy Ferris.
Fatty Dear was asleep. Asleep in his cozy log, that
had been in his home ever since Fatty was large enough
to eat wild plums, when his mother would hold the limb
down to the ground. Several bees had stopped in their
founds of gathering honey to have a little talk with friend
Fatty. This thing of bees working all the time is nonsense.
" ake up and talk to us.
for goodness sakes, for she is
and see us make honey in our
ratty well knew the place, for many is the time he
had climbed the tree and reached the little brown paw in
and made aswipe at the honeycomb. He took only a little
chunk of the golden sweet, and of course the old Queen
would get awfully angry and send some of her servants
to drive him away, and now and then he would receive a
stinjr as he slid down the tree. But I reallv believe they
were only making a bluff, for everybody loved Fatty Bear.
"Don't you ever put up any food for winter?" asked
the bees of Fatty.
Fatty grinned and said. "No, no, little folks. You see
I don't eat anything in the winter-time, for in the fall I eat
all the wild fruit I can find, and that makes me real fat
and drowsy, and I go to sleep and sleep while the ground is
covered with a carpet of snow. Bunny Rabbit makes little
paths and has a fine time playing in the snow and some
times he even jumps upon the log where I am sleeping
but I never hear. The sleet falling against the log only
makes me sleep more soundly."
"Well, come on and follow us to the tree and we will
promise not to tell the Queen." And taking wing they
took a bee-line to the tree. But of course Fatty hasn't any
wings, and if he had they wouldn't carry him! because he
is such a little pig, he is sg fat. It took lots of coaxing to
get Fatty to climb the tree because he could not reach far
enough around the trunk like he used to, and if you boys
eat too much ice cream you will be just like Fatty Bear.
But one of the bees gave him a friendly sting, which put
new life into Fatty, and up the tree he went. Sitting
astride the limb he peeped into the hole and did not dare
to make any quick motions, for you know the bees will not
harm you if you are quiet, and the quick motion is only to
be used when you are making your get-away.
There was the old Queen, mad as a hornet. "I tell
you," Fatty heard her say,"get busy and make some work
er cells, and also some drone cells. Make the drone cells
larger than the others. I hate to have you do it but I guess
you might as well makefour new queen cells, for you work
ers will never be satisfied without new queens."
After attending to these orders the workers went to
a pile of eggs (several thousand of them or more) and pro
ceeded to put an egg in each cell. Fatty looked to see if
there might be any difference in the eggs; no, they were
all alike. Fatty could hardly believe his eyes for they
filled the drone cells with food that looked like ginger
cake, and the worker cells with food that was like lemon
pie, and the queen cells with something that resembled
custard, and there stood several workers with wax to seal
up the cells, like mother seals the jam. The young bees
will have to eat their way out. How would you like to be
fastened up in a barrel of ice cream and have to eat your
way out? Wouldn't it be fun?
And the old Queen gave further orders:
"Some of you go out to the front door and stand
guard, and death to the one
