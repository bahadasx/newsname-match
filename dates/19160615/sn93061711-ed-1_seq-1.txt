REPUBLICAN'S CHOICE
AS PARTY LEADERS
Chicogn .luiiu 10. Solemnly mid
jwlth an air of resignation, the Repub
lican national committee nominated
Supreme Court Justice James Hi
for president, and Charles Warren
HUGHES
FAIRBANKS
1fpuirbunks of Indiana, for vice prcsi-
' jwdent this afternoon. Hughes received
'040 Ifc votes out of the 1185 in the con
invention on the first liallot of the day
ejj'nnd the third of the session. Rooso
p' volt, who waH at tho sumo time be
. , . Ing riotously nominated at the Pro
; igrossivo convention, got 18 V- votes
v '-In the Republican convention.
i- The settled determination of the
afc delegates to name Hughes today and
, ?R-'t the business done was only made
Ktronger by a final appeal from Roose
velt, submitted in a note from tho
Progressive convention.
The colonel, as a last peace oirering
suggested the name of Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts. North
Carolina, alone of all the forty-eight
mines an:j three territories took the
matter seriously.
Probably never in the history of a
Partv trovornmi-nt Imu (do nnmin,. ,.r
a candidate been so perfunctory as
was me nomination of Mr. Justice
Hughes. The taking of the ballot and
the slow swinging of one state after
another into the Hughes column was
applauded with the same enthusiasm
that marks the applauding of a "plug
ged" vaudeville actor by a claque in
the foyer hired for that purpose.
When the ballot was taken and the
result rnadu known, some of the real
Hughes delegates arose and paraded
with deep solemnity about the hall.
But though flags were swung and the
band played, there were ripples of
shouts only here nnd there and at
times the silence was broken only by
the shuffling of feet and the buzzing
of conversation.
Frank Hitchcock, who has supplied
most of the craft of the campaign for
Hughes, moved about among the dele-
I'lltinnu with mmtmlnltcil rm.
IV M UH onc wno should say:
"lnuse who wish to view tho re
mains will please pass to the right."
(iovernor Whitman, of New York,
the only militant Hughes man on the
floor, shot out his jaw in the particu
lar manner he employs to denote tri
umph. He did not smile. Smoot, long
and angular, looked from the platform
to Penrose, whose gigantic form tow
ered over the heads of his charges In
the Pennsylvania delegation. Penrose
looked back at Smoot. Neither of
them looked as if they were satisfied
with the work of tho doy.
The Oregon delegates, refreshed by
the rain which is their native element,
stood on their chairs for a while and
tried to yell. But when they heard
the echoes of their own voices rever
berating from the ceiling rafters they
subsided. And soon the sadness of
the occasion infected all and the noise
died away into tho dismal sizzle.
When the delegates began stream
ing this morning it became apparent
that all the arrangements for the big
event had been completed.
The first man from Illinois to show
brought word that Sherman, tho fa
vorite son of that state, had released
his delegates.
By this time most of the insiders
heard that Colonel Roosevelt had of
fered Lodge as nn acceptable substi
tute for himself.
Smoot and Crane, who have been on
the bridge since the beginning of this
weary voyage, immediately got into
action.
There was much looking for Lodge,
but Lodge was not to be found. In
a little while however, after Hitch
cock had been sent out on scouting
duty the chief's knew that Lodge sug
gestion would mako no difference.
Lodge is not exactly a man to start
anything particularly a stampede.
And a thorough search revealed that
ho was not in the house trying to work
up a boom for himself.
Then and only then was tho impos
ing Ohio chairman, Senator Harding,
given word to start the gavel ham
mering and got things under way.
the delegates camo instantly to or
der. They were filled with expecta
tion. Somo of them, having heard ru
mors of all .iorts flying round, hoped
against hope that a row of some kind
ight be on.
When Senator Smoot, at tho re
quest of tho chair, walked down tho
idge and confronted the delegates
Avith a sheaf of papers in his hands
the
ero was breathless silence.
He said:
"I have a communication to make."
Ho read: "On behalf of tho Re
publican conferees, I present for your
consideration as their candidate for
president, Justice Charles K, Hughes"
The ballot was token and Huirhes
cad with nearly tho unanimous sun-
port of the convention.
Special announcement will be iriven
tomorrow for tho Democratic sneak-
ling at tho Court House Friday night.

NEW MEXICO BOOSTERS
The automobile tourists from Las
Vegas, who in company with some of
Tucumcari's boosters, made a trip to
Galveston Texas, passing through the
best cities of Texas, returned as far
as Tucumcari today, and are being
served with a banquet at the Voren
berg tonight.
They have enjoyed a most rtleasant
trip and were royally entertained ov
ury whore they chanced to stop long
enough. This trip has cost consider
able, but Las Vegas never dr-s any
thing by halves and no doubt will rear
a bountiful harvest for their efforts to
bring tourists to New Mexico where
tho scenery is just a fine ns any whore
on enrth. Investors can find plenty of
places to put their money whore it
will pay them n good percent.
We need more such booster trips
and Tucumcari should get busy und
awoken to the fact "those who ask
shall receive" but those who ask not
arc unknown and stand alone.

SENATOR ISAAC BARTH
SCORES LOBBIESTS IN
SPEECH MONDAY NIGHT
Isaac Barth was here Monday get
ting acquainted with the voters of
Quay county. Ho was hero ut the in
vitntion of the Young Democratic club
and spoke before an appreciative au
dience at the opera house Monday eve
ning. Hie speech was heartily ap
plauded and his message was from the
heart of a man who stands for hon
esty and square dealings between his
fellow men.
He was introduced by the president
of the club, Isaac L. Kirkpatrick, who
explained why the club was organized
and what it intended to accomplish.
Mr. Ilorth's first remarks wore some
what comical, but after taking up the
subject of the evening's address pol
itics, state and national -his asser
tion in regard to the operations of the
lobby gang at Santa Fe during sc.v
sions of the state legislature, were too
horrible and no doubt true to cnuso
laughter. The truths he knows and
tells are enough to cause any honest
man to bow in shame. He says tho
siate legislature was dominated by
four lohhiests, Messrs. Spless, Haw
kins, ilursom and Springer and noth
ing was accomplished without first ob
taining the sanction of one of these
men. He said Hawkins was said to
be the working man's friend, especial
ly the railroader. Mr. Barth said he
would go to Santa Fe and see what
the railroad men wanted and then he
would see that they didn't get it, no
matter whether it was better for tho
company or not. He said Hawkins
took it for granted thnt if a railroad
workman wanted anything then it was
wrong for him to let it pnss because
Ins company would not sanction his
work in the lobby and would cut out
that big salary.
Mr. Barth spoke highly of Governor
McDonald and complimented him up
on the stand lie took when he vetoed
hills slipped through the legislature
by the gangsters. He said the good
laws or those not favorable to the
four bosses, never got out of the com
mittee room. He said that New Mex
ico has as many good people on tho
average as uny other state, but the
good people hove not yet awakened
to the fact that they are needed to
mix in politics. If the good men arid
women would work like the crooked
politicians New Mexico would be made
better and laws would be provided to
uphold honest government.
Mr. Barth made many friends while
in town and proved himself plenty big
to occupy the governor's chnir, phys
ically, morally and politically.
