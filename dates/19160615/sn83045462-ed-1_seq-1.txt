hyphen issue, which Is becoming acute. J *
The morning German newspaper, the j ^
Westliche Post, formerly a democratic a
paper but now anti-Wiison. comes out a
with an editorial today again attack- a
ing the President. It charges him with c
failing to live up to the party's pro- *
tensions of neutrality; says he de
manos me pouna or nesh from the cen- a
tral powers and is easy with the allies; t
that he opposes the U-boat policy of
the Germans, while knowing Its a ban- ^
donment would cripple Germany's mil- j r
ltary effectiveness. j I
On the other hand, the Post-Dispatch.
Mr. Pulltser's paper, supports the
President and charges Mr. Hughes with
failure to make clear his attitude toward
the hyphen. ^
The delegates are deeply Interested i
in the question and are anxiously ,
awaiting the report of the committee .

BT. LOUIS, June 15.?As the subcommittee
which will put the finishing
touches to the democratic platform
closed the doors today on a crowd of
ivnman suffrage workers and others
Interested In platform planks, it be- j
lame evident that there is only a slight '
chance for the insertion of a plank
pledging the party to grant local self- 1
srovernment and home rule in the Na- j
ifonal Capital, together withxa promise
i)f liberal treatment by Congress. John |
Ii. Colpoys, the District of Columbia j
member of the platform committee, |
made his plea for thi6 plank in the I
wee small hours of the morning. I
Being recognized at the tail end of a
iong procession of men and women who i
liad planks of all descriptions to show
:he cabinet makers, Mr. Colbys' plank, J
which has been printed in The Star, j
had the backing of the District dele- |
cates, and contained their idea of a :
i?road but brief statement of the needs '
uf the District. The committee, how- j
ever, is not inclined at this moment to f
:ake up any such matter as suffrage? I
:ither male, female or universal?for the
District of Columbia, on the theory that
the platform should contain matters of
national scope only. Too many details,
they believe, will prevent the platform
from being read.
Mr. Colpoys had time only for a brief
presentation. He said, however, that
tven if a plank could not be inserted
In advocacy of the District's needs, that
the democratic party should adopt an
administrative and congressional policy
which would lead toward the things
tsked in the proposed plank, especially
liberal treatment.
Aided by Senator Hughes.
Men who appeared before the republican
onmmltt?i at Chicago urging an j
Adequate plank covering the party's pledge [
to advance the cause of civil service reform
appeared again last night before !
the platform makers of the democratic J
party, and to their number was added j
Senator Hughes of New Jersey, Repre- I
sentatime Hamill of New Jersey, author j
of a civil service reform bill now before j
the House of Representatives, and former
Representative Riley of Connecticut.
Dr. Llewellyn Jordan of Chicago and
Washslngton, and Thomas Flaherty, both
of whom have made almost endless pleas
before congressional committees for civil
service reform, and a retirement and pension
fund for the older employes of the
government, put the question squarely up
to the platform committee tonight, and
exDressed themselves frankly as disap
pointed with the plank given ny tne re- i
publican party. Representative HamiU
described the republican plank as a reactionary
one:
"Pensions in civil service are not gratuities,"
he said, "but are deferred wages,
which were not paid at the time earned.
Government employes have the right to
see their maintenance clear to the end
of their lives, but they cannot do this
without a pension and retirement system
In view of the increased living costs. ?ven
the government of Turkey has passed the
at atmm in this regard and gives
to its employes, who grow old In the
service an adequate pension. The United
States and the Island of Haiti are the
two governments left, which fail to recognize
the merit of the civil service pension."
Senator Hughes said that the civil service
is a democratic Institution; and that

Proposes Text of Platform.
Thomas Flaherty had but a moment
to explain his views of the case
and spoke briefly from the standpoint J
of a postal employe. Dr. Jordan was I
able to make a fuller presentation ofthe
case.
He presented the proposed plank,
which is as follows;
"We also favor aTTd pledge our support
to secure the enactment of an
equitable retirement law providing for
ttte retirement of superannuated and
disabled employes of the civil service,
to the end that a higher standard of
efficiency may be maintained."
I Dr. Jordan said: \
"The republican party failed to inI
corporate any declaration in the ini
terest of civil service other than a de
[ nunciation of the democratic party in
its administration of the civil service
law and promising the electorate that
! if the republican party should win the
coming election it pledged its support
I to an extension of the civil service and
its reorganization along lines of efficiency-*
and economy.
"It is significant that despite .the
'earnest efforts which were made by
Che civil service committee, that Senator
Lodge, chariman of the resolutions
I committee, refused upon the request
of Senator Sterling to incorporate any
! declaration in the republican party
j platform, dealing with the subject of
I civil service retirement legislation. I
j am satisfied from my personal interviews
with a number of the members
i of the resolutions committee of the re!
publican party that these members
| would gladly have supported a declaration
in favor of some equitable form
I of civil service retirement legislation.
Backed by 3,000,000 Voters.
1 "Backed as our demands are in re!
spect to the needs of the civil service
by 3,000,000 voters who are wage earn'
ers and constitute the membership of
| the American Federation of Labor, and
supported by 400,000 civil service employes,
the great majority of whom are
j voters, we cannot help but believe that
1 the democratic party .will rise to the
occasion ?nd show its friendly interest
j in the civil service of our country by
I the adoption of a ringing decoration
nn t ho f tvfl coruloo Ion- in'' *ho 'nr./..
i poration of a constructive plank pointing
out to the electorate of the country
where the civil service should be
I improved and greater efficiency secured
on the part of the personnel in the
recognition, not only of the merit prin|
ciple of appointment, but also a recognition
of the urgent and imperative necessity
of introducing a more econom1
leal administration of governmental af!
fairs as applied to the civil service by
the passage of legislation providing for
the retirement of the superannuated
and disabled employes in that service, I
who are now retained largely because
i of humanitarian reasons, but who are
in many instances rendering but little
service in return for compensation or
wages paid.
"It is a well established fact, which
cannot be gainsaid, that the federal
government is maintaining a pension
system for aged employes throughout
are not capable, through physical infirmity,
to render efficient service."
The resolutions committee was still
at work at -an early hour in? the morning
and had not made any report on
the civil service plank.

been patrolling the vicinity of th?
wreck since early morning.
The Oregon arrived before daybreak
and played its big searchlights through
the foe to no avail.

Capt. L. M. Mopande' did not send

believing he could clear hie
boat. Apparently finding the steamer

gers out of their bertths and into the
lifeboats.
Ordered to Abandon Ship.
The order to abandon the ship came
at midnight. Everybody went over the
sides into small boats. The Bear was
leaking badly when deserted and at
daybreak showed signs of breaking up.
The steamer Bear of the San Francisco
and Portland1 Steamship Company
was south bound, with 119 passengers
and a crew of 82 men. from Portland,
Ore., for San Francisco.
The order to abandon ship was given
at midnight, and all on board got away
safely. The steamer went ashore during
a thick fog, but the sea was reported
smooth, and assistance frpm
Eureka, fifteen miles away, made all
haste to the shipwrecked company.

American Munitions Aid.
Information received from the Auero-Swiss

nd guns, large quantities of which
ave been imported by Russia in the

The Military Journal, published in Ausria,
confirms these reports. It states

Having cut the railway comr

ghting for possession of that city
ito its very outskirts. Its fall is molentarilv

of Kovel they have pushed a

of Vladimir-Yolynski. This
ercing of the Austrian line places the

Hasty Retreat Goes On.
At many intermediate points between
northern and southern points of

retreating so ha.ttily that they are
it of touch with the Russians. It is
mored that the Austrians are evacu
