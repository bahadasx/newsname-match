to a late report from Genera: Mann.
The total number of Mexican dead is
now placed at eight, the American
dead three, and the wounded six.
Laredo. June 15. One hundred
Mexican bandits, crossing over the Km
Grande, forty miles southeast of here,
earlv today attacked the American
border patrol near Sati Ignacio. killing
two and wounding five, according to
reports sent to Fort Mcintosh, here
over the field telephone. Word reach
ed here later that one of the wounded
American soldiers shot through the
head had died. The latest information
cava that eight of the Mexicans were
killed and forty-two horses captured
in the pursuit. Colonel Brown has re
quested county officials to warn all
Mexicans in ranches near here to get
away from the river.
The Mexicans expected to una an ,

ried to the scene, arriving in a few
minutes. The attackers soon lost
heart. They retreated southward
alonK the river, keeping on the Amer
ican, side for some distance before
crossing hack to Mexican soil.
Battle lasted Thirty Mii-ntes.
The attack began at '1 a. m. The
fighting lasted about thirty minute?.
A bright moon lightened the scenes.
The American? were only partially
surprised. The Mexicans succeeded in
making their way around to the rear
the patrols camp. The first shot was
directed at a sentry.
The names of the dead soldiers were !
not reported to military headquarters j
at Fort Mcintosh for the reason that j
immediately after the attack, the two
troops of cavalry started in pursuit
of the Mexicans. There
no tele-
phone line in tne intermediate space
i.etween iroop ra. Ration ana tne next
patrol farther south.
It was taken for granted here that
Malor Oray would pursue the bandits
until they crossed into Mexico and it
would not be surprising if the Ameri
cans should follow the "hot trail
across the river. It was impossible
to learn anything of the identity of
the Mexicans here other than they
were merely "bandits." Those killed
ar.d wounded were dressed in peon
garb, but were exceptionally well
armed. The name of the leader, or
the affiliations of the organization was
not learned.
Were on Troopers' Trail.
That it was not the intention of the
raiders to sack the little town of San
Ignacio was indicated in their ap
proaching the camp some distance
from the settlement. This was re
garded as almost positive evidence
that a premeditated attack on the bor
der patrol was the only thing in mind.

the constitution creates a county of

electors by whose suffrage the office
is to be filled.

I For' years teachers at county and
j state institutes have passed resolu
; Uons urging that the right of suffrage
I be taken away from voters in cities of

I The decision Is the result of the re
1 fusal of John Doane, county clerk of

i cause a majority of those signing the

Eureka, Cal., June 15. None of the
lifeboats carrying the 119 passengers
and a crew of ninety-seven men who
abandoned the steamer Bear of the
San Francisco & Portland Steamship
company when she went aground in
the fog on Sugar Loaf Rock, near Cape
Mendocino, late last night had been
picked up at daybreak today.

The count of passengers stood as fol

Of eight life boats, which got away 1
from the Bear, two made shore, one

ber was picked up by the Grace Dollar.
All the dead were washed ashore at
Capetown.
, Among tne survivors two were re-
!ported to be fataiIy injured. Many
had sustained minor injujries and all
were suffering from exposure. The
two boats landed at the mouth of Bear
river during the night. Men and wo
men, numbed with cold drenched and
in various stages of exhaustion drag
ged themselves from the boats and
sought shelter along the beach. Some
made wind breaks from driftwood.
Others found no refuge from the wind
and cold save the boulders that line
the shore. Others burrowed into the
cold sand and spent the night there.
They were found at dawn this morn
ing and taken to Capetown. Rescue
steamers continued to roam about in
the fog with scarcely a chance of see
ing a boat a hundred fet away. The
searchlights of the battleship Oregon
barely cut the fog.
Awakened In Xiht by Crash.
The survivors told how they had
been awakened by the shock and
rushed on deck in their night clothes,
the women screaming In terror. Great
holes had been torn in the steamer's
bt-w olates but the captain after an
examination assured the passengers
there was no danger. They were di
rected, however, to get ready to leave
the vessel. The. women gathered in
th vessel's captain praying- and weep
ing. When Captain Nopander decided
that there was no hope of saving the
steamer, the passengers and crew took
to the boats in good order. There
was little difficulty in launching the
boats. The two boats that landed at
Bear river were separated from the
others in the fog and made for the
shore five miles away. They con
tained twenty men and women.

Dr. E. S. Pettyjohn of Topeka. med
ical director, was defeated for re-election
by Dr. O. L Peak of Springfield,
Mo.
There is a proposed amendment to
the constitution before the convention
which would increase tae number of
trustees of the national organization
from five to seven.
The election of officers, so far as it
has proceeded, is a victory for the fac
tion supporting J. M. Kirkpatrick.
That faction appears to have complete
control of the convention when it
comes to matters involving votes.
Today's election of J. M. Kirkpat
rick is the climax to an internal fight,
led on the one side by W. B. Kirk
patrick, one of the founders of the
order and its president since the or
ganization, and on the other by J. M. j
Kirkpatrick, a son who has grown up
in the Knights and Ladies of Security j
order. The fight has been in progress ,
for a year but broke into the open ;
onJy a few months ago. All over the
country where branches of the order
exist" there was a contest over the
naming of delegates. Most of the dele
gates went to the convention, pledged
either to the younger or the - eider
Kirkpatrick.
To the Supreme Court.
A part of the fight found its tyay
into the Kansas supreme court. W. B.
Kirkpatrick, as president, made ap
pointments to the law committee, and
the executive committee refused to ac
cept his appointments. Members of
the law committee have votes in the
national convention. , President Kirk
patrick carried the matter to the su
preme court and only a few days be
fore the convention was called the
court held that his appointments
should stand.
The elder Kirkpatrick had the sup
port of a large percentage of the old
er members of the order. The son
had the backing of the young blood
and that faction appears to have se
cured control of the national organi
zation. J. M. Kirkpatrick has shown
confidence in his position ever since
the convention was brought toeether
and has at all times counseled ob
servance of the rulings' of W. B. Kirk
patrick, who as president, presided at
the sessions. He stopped a stampede
when his father adjourned the con
vention twice before the roll had been
called.

the arbitration proposition was not
