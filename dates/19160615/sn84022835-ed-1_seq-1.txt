F. W. Cowden also wtnt into details
concerning the meeting of the Nubias
ha State Commeiclal Clubs, held i.t
Omaha, May '.Mill and '.'Mb. His ie
port contained many valuable sug
gestions, also gave sutlleieut pioof ot
what had and could be done along the
line of public imptovemeuts, the main
object being to "get down to brass
tacks", and 'do .something instead of
taking up valuable time discussing
what they could do and just how it
could be done.
If everyone would show as much
enthusiasm as Mr. Cowden, it would
be but a matter a short time until this
improvement is under way. It is
hoped that the interest shown by those
attending this meeting will continue,
for Tied Cloud lias never yet attempted
anything ot which they have not
mado a Miccess.
Mayor Damerell was present at this
meeting and said the county was will
ing to contribute ?-30 towards putting
the road between here and the Kan
sas line in first, class shape, if the
citizens would contribute tlio Mtme

to do this, and a committee, composed
of Messrs. .Jell' Diamond, Paul Stmvy

To Regulate Traffic
The Bppearanco of three red lings on
the piincipal thoroughfare of our city,
tlio llrst of the week, created consider
able interest among the residents of
this city ami vacinity. If you have
thought that they wore advertisements
for an auction sale, you liavo missed
your guess. Tho fact of tlio matter ist
we arc beginning to adopt the ordin
ances of the metropolitan cities, re
garding street tn Die. The mayor and
council have decided to adopt the
'safety first" methods used by our
sister cities. Tlie.se Hags remind driv
ers of autos and vehicles that on Jgo
lug north that they are to keop to tho
Fast of thu maiker, and on going
south, to thu opposite Hide, also that
souaie coiners must be turned at the
end of each block, and not any place
.in the block as heretofore. If di Ivors
, wish to remain in the good graces of
the city maislial tiiey will bear these
. facts in mind, and thereby avoid a re-
