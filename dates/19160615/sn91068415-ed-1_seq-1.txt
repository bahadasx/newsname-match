"The president elect of -Birmingham
was congratulating himself
over the selection of the board when
seen last night. He said he appre
ciated the honor, and would take
hold of the work at Birmingham
college with determination and en
thusiasm. The millionaire chairman of the
board: of trustees, R S. Munger, of
Birmingham, gives the following
statement to the Age-Herald:
"We are proud to announce the
election of Mr. Haynes as president
of Birmingham college. We believe
in selecting him we have the proper
man to place at the head of Bir
mingham college. He is a layman
of the Methodist church, a Christian
gentleman and a very active church
and Sunday School worker. He
stands for the , higher -things , in
Christian life and education, and
comes to us with more than 40 tes
timonials from ministers, educators,
lawyers, doctors, business men and
statesmen. His recommendations
are from the best people of the
south, and we consider
bilt university and received his
master's degree. He has-served the
United States" government in the
diplomatic service at Rouen, France,
Vladivostock, Russia and Nanking,
China,. He is widely experienced vof
broad and sympathetic viewpoint,
and his addition to the list of Bir
mingham eoUicators will be k mate
rial gain. However, , because, of Dr.
Simpson 's great work at Birming
ham college, Birmingham will nat
urally expect much of the college's
new presiaeni.

On Jast Toesday evening the
Alumni association held its meeting
and the following excerpt, from a
newspaper report is reproduced:
To me, the greatest thing in the
world is growth," said Mr. Haynes
The whole universe was builded
upon that plan. We should "remem
ber that evolution is a process and
not a product, and that God :has
made it an uncharitable law that
man grows by making.' "
In closing his speech Mr. Haynes
said that he had expressed his opin
ion of Birmingham's needs as being
in three P's -publicity, personal
touch and prayer.
The alumni rejoiced that the head
of the institution is an athletic man.
It was found that Mr. Haynes had
made his letters in football and
baseball at Vanderbilt. .
