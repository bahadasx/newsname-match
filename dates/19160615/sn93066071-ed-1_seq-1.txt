THE NOMINATIONS AT CHICAGO.
The HepubMcan and Progressiva Na
tional Conventions, buhl in Chicago
last week, spent tho entire week try
ing to get together, but without re
sults. Tho Progressives hail but one
cliolco for a presidential nominee
Theodore Ilooievelt, The old lino Re
publicans had a large number of "fn
vorito sonn" to choose from, but didn't
get to a ballot until late Friday after
noon. It had been understood for many
hours by moat of the delegates that
there was no possible chance for the
two parties to agree on a single can
didate for both. Word got nut that
the Republican Convention was about
ready to ballot on a caudidate.and the
Progressive immediately uomiutted
Kooaevelt by unanimous acclamation,
In less than an hour afterwards the
Republicans nominated Chief Justioe
Huglus as their.candidate.
Notice of this action by the Repub
lican convention was sent by special
messenger to Justice Hughes, and he
dispatched an answer back tn tne con
vention immediately accepting the
great honor.
Tiie Progressives notified Roosevelt
of the action of the com en t Ion tender
ing him the nomination. Roosevelt
had already heard of the nomination
of Ilnghes Ho answered the tele
phone notice by the same route. He
thanked the convention for the prof
fered nomination but declined it, say
ing that under that present condition
of affairs he could not accept it at that
instant: but If the convention was not
satisfied with his action, it could, if it
thought it beat, finish up its other bus
iness and adjourn, leating the Nation,
al Executive Committee still in ses
sion for a limited time. In tho mean
time he would study the situation in
all its phases and bearings, and nt tho
appointed timo he would present his
views to tho Committee, and if it was
still agreed to give him the nomina
tion, ho would then give his definite
answer. Ting proposition was agreed
to, and the Committee will remain In
session until Juno 25th,

G. LAYERS FOR COUNTY
SUPERINTENDENT.
County Superintendent G. T. Ayers
again presents himself for nomination
for the olllee of County Superintend
ent on the Republican ticket
-Mr. Ayers was born near Fairileld,
Illinois, and received his education at
that place, completing the grade anil
high' 8chb.il courses, and afterwards
attending Uarvaid College at Quinoy,
Illinois, After completing his college

For two years he served In the ca
pacity of a teacher In tho Illinois State
Reformatory, which ranks second in
the United S'ates among institutions
of that kind, He resigned this posi
tion to neeept a position as Train Aud
itor on tliu Rock Island, which posi
tion he filled creditably.
Seven years ago he came to Beaver
County and took up some school land
near Florls, During the seven years
he has taught terms of school In this
county, and has n clear record of past
successes. He is one of our leading
educators, and his services aro always
in demand.
His rocord as County Superintend
ent is without a Haw, In spito of the
fact that he has hud opposition
amounting nlmoit to persecution, yot
neer at any time has anyone been
iibln to show that he has iiegluoted his
duty or been guilty of any overt act
for hlch ho could be criticised by any
perron of honest and open mind. Such
an administration deserves tho en

gentleman, honest, upright, sincere,
without conceit, without guile, audit
is such men ns this that we neeu to

YOUR CHANCE TO DRESS UP
Your attention is called to Feluberg's
ad In this Issue nf thn Herald and
especially to one statement.
Mr. Felnberg's eastern buyer was
recently fortunate tn making some pur
chases In the eastern markutsat speola
reduced prices. These purchases con
sisted chiefly of largo lota of Men's
and Boy'B lino clothing, and tho bulk
of these goods was shipped to Heaver.
In order that tho store might not
become too crowded It has been
decided to continue their big clothing
sale at reduced prices and, beginning
Saturday June 17, this clothing will bo
placed on sale at what Is ordinarily
wholesale cost. This big sale will con
tinue 13 days until June 30th.
At least call at tho storo, whether
you intend to buy or not, and meet
tho manacor, Mr. Cooper. You will
llnd him a pleasant and courteous gen
tlsnian, always ready to show you the
stock and to do his utmost to see that
you are pleased with tho quality, tho

AN EXPLANATION.
As everyone knows, tho trains have
not beeh running on tho W. F & N. W.
for almost two weeks. As a result,
Tiik Hbralu has been confronted with
the same proposition which confronts
almost every buslneaa hnuio In town
that of not being able to secure goods
and material ordered several weeks
ngo.
Tho paper for this week's Issue Is
held up somewhere between here and
Wichita. Knowing this would be the
ease, we wired the paper house last
Monday and had a duplicate shipment,
shipped by express, to Liberal. We
have made every ellort to get this ship
ment to Reaver, but all efforts have
been In aln, We delayed going to
press until Friday morning, and still
no paper. So we ere Issuing on the
half-shell, and are late.
A DEADLY MENACE.
Thero has been but very little warm
weather this summer up to this time,
and perhaps because of this, Hies have
not become so numerous as usual. Still
thero aro plenty of them. Warm
weather Is coming soon, however, and
then illes will appear In myriads. It
is advisable to take precautions In ad
vance and keep all premises as clean
as possible. Trash and slops should not
bo allowed to stand lit tho house, nei
ther should it be poured on the ground
near the Iioiibo. In fact, where possi
ble, it Is best to have a cess-pool, or to
empty in some definite placo and keep
It disinfected with some dependable
disinfectant.
After tho Hies are here we can swat
them, catch them on tly papar and in
traps, and light them in other ways.
In order to bo successful It Is neces
sary that the entire town join In the
fight against this spreader of disease
and death. It is your duty to yourself
and family, as, well as to all other In
habitants of Heaver, to do your utmost
to-ftssiat in inakiuif. this a ilyles 'town.
It may requires small outlay o7 cash
to successfully fight this pest, but it
Is one of the best Investments anyone
ever made. The maimer In which
Hies gather filth and disease germs and
deposit them in food Is almost too re
volting to speak of, If every person
could look at a tly's legs through a
high-power microscope, each would
become a convert and join the fly
swotting brigade without further
delay.
It is thn babies and smaller children
that Buffer the most, since their food
is largely milk, and milk is one of the
best (or worst) breeding places for
germs, where It Is exposed to tiles.
Thero are a thousand ways in which
Hies carry germs, and the only way to
protect ourselves Is to use every avail
able means to utterly destroy them.
Luther Mcllride and Lloyd Shaw are
recovering from an attack ot measles.
