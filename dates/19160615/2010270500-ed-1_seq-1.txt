The candidate this fall who expects

of the history of the world. All the
politicians are building fences. Dan
V. Stephens knows he will have a
man to beat this year and the differ
ent postmasters in his district know
he is sure keeping in touch with all
the voters.
Tekamah Journal: Congressman
Dan Stephens will .have a lot of ex
plaining to do to the voters of his dis
trict this fall. He has an opponent
in the person of William P. Warner,
who is going to make him hot foot
it to come anywhere near being re
elected. Dan'l himself realizes that
he is up against it this time and is
trimming his sails accordingly; He
will be careful to plan his campaign
this year and will make an effort to
remain on all sides of all proposi
tions in order to get every vote.
Dan's name will be Dennis, we feel,
after "Bill" Warner gets done with
him.

Sioux City Daily News, 9th: No
bids were received Thursday at the
offering for sale of the combination
bridge by F. L. Eaton, special mas
ter in chancery, and the sale was ad
journed until July 1, at which time
another opportunity will be given
to bid on it. A couple of dozen cu
rious ones shivered about the corri
dor as Mr. Eaton read the order of
sale and asked for bids, but those
who attended the sale did not look
like they were in the class able to
put up a $10,000 certified check to
show good faith before bidding.
Attorney John Joseph and Rev. C.
N. McMillan, head and shoulders of
the Woodbury County Antisaloon
league, were on hand, having heard
the Overland Transportation com
pany, of Jackson, Neb., was going
to buy the bridge. But such report
proved only a rumor.

Sioux City Journal, 9th: One
hundred and fifty, members of the
A. O. U. W. assembled at Crystal
Lake park yesterday to celebrate
the thirtieth anniversary of the
founding of the Nebraska grand
lodge. Frank L. Anderson, of Hol
drege, grand master of the state, is
attending the festivities. The cele
bration started at 10 o'clock. A
ball game between two picked teams
was scheduled for 1:30 o'clock. Bas
ket luncheon was served at noon.
Games and athletic stunts will feat
ure the day's program. The even
ing will be given over to dancing in
the park pavilion, Music will be fur
nished by Wilson's orchestra, of
Sioux City James C. Wonder,
senior highway engineer in the fed
eral bureau of public roads, depart
ment of agriculture, who was called
to Dakota county, Neb., by the farm
management association- of that
county, yesterday conducted an in
vestigation preparatory to the con
struction of a permanent road be
tween Dakota City and South Sioux
City. Mr. Wonder has been in Da
kota county for a week making soil
testa and laying plans for the build
inf of a permanent road between
the principal towns of the county.
Before being called to Dakota coun
ty, Mr. Wonder spent three weeks
in Holt county, Neb., and prior to
that made similar inspections in oth
er Nebraska counties. Mr. Wonder
made estimates on the construction
of $4,000,000 worth of highways in
Missouri before being called to Ne
braska. His examinations take into
consideration soil conditions with a
view to arriving at the best material
to be selected for premanent road
construction. He says the Dakota
county roads now are in better con
dition than any other county he has
yet visited The Combination
bridge went begging for a purchaser
at the public auction conducted yes
terday afternoon by F. L. Eaton,
special master in chancery, under ap
pointment of Federal Judge Henry
T. Reed. There were no bidders. Af
ter waiting on the court house steps
for one hour and forty-five minutes
for a bidder, Special Master Eaton
adjourned the sale until July 10.
Mr. Eaton, as required by law, had
to read the special notice of the sale,
consitting of several thousand words,
and the supplemental decree of
Judge Reed, filed on June G, contain
ing more than 1,000 words. "Gen
tlemen, I am here to sell the Combi
nation bridge in its entirety," said
Mr. Eaton, addressing a small
group of men, consisting of two at
torneys, three reporters and five
courthouse nttaches who were at
tracted to the scene. "Have I any
bid?" There was no answer. One
of the lookers-on said he had 10 cents
to start the bidding. "That will
help," said Mr. Eaton, "but I want
to give notice at this time that any
one caring to bid on the structure
will have to deposit $10,000 in cash
or a certified check lor that amount
as a guarsntee that they will carry
out the terms of the bid." There
was no proffer of $10,000 in gold or
a certified check for that amount.
"Well, I guess I will rest," said Mr.
Eaton, tired from reading the long
legal notices. He sat down in a
chair and lighted a cigar. This was
at 1:20 o'clock. At 2:4t5 o'clock no
bidder had appeared and the special
master adjourned the sale until next
month. E. A. Burgess, attorney for
the Fort Dearborn Trust and Savings
bank and the Union Trust company,
of Indianapolis, who filed the pro
ceedings which threw the bridge in
to the hands or the receiver, was
not present. His law partner, Fred
H. Free, appeared as the legal rep
resentative for the stockholders of
the bridge company. "My clients
are the ones that are getting 'gyp
ped,' " said Mr. Free. "Still, if we
could sell the bridge for scrap iron
we might get some money out of
it.' .Paul Hatfield, of the law firm
of Henderson & Fribourg, appeared
as representative of some of the
bondholders who live in Indianapolis.

Looking Backward.
Dakota City Mail, June 9, 1876:
A petition is being circulated and
numerously sighned, asking the
county clerk to call an extra meet
ing of the commissioners to see
what can be done in regard to the
question of a narrow gauge railroad,
a subject that is now much talked of
in this favored part of Eden.
Sioux City Journal, June 9, 1896:
Born, on June 7, 1896, to Dr. and
Mrs. J. E. Dewalt, of Morningside,
a son.... Miss Nellie Dibble, of Da
kota City, was in town yesterday on
her way home from Palo Alto, Cal.,
where she has been attending Leland
Stanford university .... On his farm
across the river in Dakota county D.
C. Dibble has a car load of 2-year-
old Hereford steers which have been
fattened on corn. They average
1,700 apiece... .Henry W. Wood, of
Dakota county, was in the city yes
terday returning homo from Wood
bine, la., where he was visiting his
daughter. Mr. Wood has 5,000
acres of improved bottom farm land
across the river. He says the rains
did not wash out any of the corn on
his farms and he will not be bother
ed with replanting.... One of the
finest collections of Indian relics and
war trophies in the United States is
owned by D. C. Bristol ("Omaha
Charley"), of Homer, Neb. He is
not an educated man, but he has the
history of each piece of Indian work
in the collection in memory, and can
explain the use of every article, as
he has spent nearly all his life among
the Indians. He may bring his col
lection to Sioux City during the fair
this fall. It would make quite an
attraction, and no doubt would be
very interesting to those who have
never seen a collection of this sort.
SCOURS FROM INDIGESTION
The common cause of scours in
calves is indigestion, or inflamation
in the stomach. This may bo brought
about by a large variety of causes,
but in any caso the aim of the treat
ment should be to remove the source
of the inflamation. As in most other
ailments, half of the battle in curing
scours is to begin treatment as soon
as any trouble is noticed. The Col
lege of Agriculture says that the
calves should bo watched closely and
treatment administered upon the
first indication of scours. Treatment
should always begin by cutting down
the ration, thus giving the calf a
chance to rid itself of the irritating
material. The milk should be cut
down to at least one-half and in se
vere cases withheld entirely. In most
cases after one or two feeding peri
ods hu'-p passed, the calf will appear
norn !.. i.nd full feeding can be grad
ually i sumed.
In luu.o obstinate cases it may be
necessary to administer a physic of
2 or 51 ounces of castor oil given in a
little milk. After a calf has suflferd
with scours, feeding should always
be light for a few days until the calf
regains its strength.
SUGGESTIONS FOR HANDLING CREAM
Cool the cream each time after
separating. Where ice is not to be
had, place the can in a vat of cold
water, preferably running water.
Never pour warm cream in with
cool cream, as this practice will raise
the temperature of the. whole and
encourage bacterial growth, causing
the cream to become sour and de
velop bad flavors and odors.
When marketing, it is a good prac
tice to cover the can first with a wet
blanket and then with a dry blanket.
This will help to keep the cream
cool.
Grading cream is becoming more
and more important. Frequently
the prices vary from 3 to 4 cents a
pound between properly and im
properly handled cream. College of
Agriculture.
ESSENTIALS OF A GOOD LEASE
It should be written.
It, Bhoukbbe definite.- . ,
It should provide for crop rotation.
It, should provide for raising a
legume.
It should' encourage the keeping
of live stock.
It should put a penalty on slipshod,
careless methods.
It should insure the tenant in
the event of his removal from the
farm againBt losing the value of
manure or fertilizer recently applied
and of legumes and grasses recently
sowed. In addition to the foregoing
essentials, the College of Agricul
ture says that the lease should be
written with reference to the par
ticular farm in question. No per
fect form of lease can be written to
apply to all conditions.
JUNIOR SHORT COURSE
Seventy boys and girls, ranging
from 12 to 20 years of ago and rep
resenting 19 counties, enrolled at the
annual short course in agriculture
and home economics of the School of
Agriculture at Lincoln last week.
The course was intended particular
ly for members of the Boys' and
Girls' clubs conducted cooperatively
by the United States Department of
Agriculturo and tho Extension Ser
vice of the College of Agriculture.
Instruction was given to the boys in
live stock, crops, soils, farm machin
ery, gardening, and woodworking.
Instruction was given to the girls in
cooking, canning, sewing, choice of
clothing, homo furnishings, and
home decoration, as well as in wood
work. Various excursions were
planned for those in attendance.
STRAWBERRY JELLY
Strawberries nlone do not make
good jelly, because they do not con
tain enough pectin. To make Btraw
berry jelly, the College of Agricul
ture says to boil the white part of
an oranga peel until tender and add
the juice to tho strawberries. To
determine whether or not pectin is
present in the Juice of any fruit,
place two tableshoonfuls of the fruit
juice in a clear glass and add an
equal quantity of 95 per cent grain
alcohol. Carefully turn the glass
over on one side. If pectin is pres
ent a largo amount of it will be in
tho form of a clear lump. If this is
the esse, it is safe to add as much
sugar as juice. If the pectin is pres
ent in small lumps, use less sugar
than juice.
