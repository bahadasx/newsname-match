PEG ATKINSON JUST
LIKE IMMORTAL G.W.
Under Oath He Found He
Could Not Tell a
Lie.
Regardless of the many opinions
to the contrary men under oath will
according to Constable Harry Conners
tell the truth more often than will
an untruth even though the untruth
works a hardship on them. A case in
point Conner says, Is the'statement of
A. E. "Peg" Atkinson.of,Worthington.
Atknlson has been charged with soil
ing whiskey by prosecuting attorney
Walter Haggeirty. The evidence against
him was slim and on his account the
case did not come "to trial. x He was
asked under oath if Mrs. Atkinson
ad ever/sold any^tilskeyi . Thinking
deeply, and visibly ill at ease knowing
what heart rungs/it would cause to
tell the truth ana. knowing.' that. he
had called upon God in-Heaven to wit
ness his oath, gritted hiB teeth and
looked Mr. Haggerty squarely in the
eyes and said. "She has."
Asked whether h'dt'would tell the
same story on the wltuess stand in
the event that the:Statejshould place
Mrs. Atkinson on the stand he said:
"I liave sworn to you that Mrs. Atkin
son has sold whiskey'and'as a Wit
ness under oath I will tell the same
story."
With this information at hand,
prosecutor Haggerty swore oht lnfor
matlon requesting the arrest olj Mrs.
Atkinson. Squire Leigh Fleming
placed a warrant in the hands of Con
stable Harry Conners. yesterday ev
ening. Cqnner brought Mrs. Atkinson
to jail last night.
Atkinson and FVed Goloboss are al
so in jail and will be used as witness
eB against Mrs. Atkinson on a warrant
charging her with soiling whiskey at
Worthington at the. profitable price
of $3 -per.quart <ps i
