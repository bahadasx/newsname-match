ST. I.oriS. Juno 14. The Demo
cratic national convention, at its
first session today, heard the keynote
of Americanism and pence, prepared
ness and prosperity sounded hy former
Governor Olynn of New York, a
temporary chairman, and with a high
pit-h of enthusiasm emphatically reg
istered liy demonstration after dem
onstration its approval of l'residont
Wilson's peaceful conduct of foreign
affairs.
The convention which had molten
under way with such perfunctory dem
onstrations us mark every national
gathering of the kind, soon stirred
Itself into inuring cheers as Chairman
Olynn cited historic parallels to show
that other presidents, including Re
publicans, had adjusted threatening
foreign situations without resort to
war.
"The policy of the administration,"
he declared, "has been Just as Amer
ican as the American flan itself."
lie went down the list of presidents
recounting their action to avoid war,
the delegates caught the spirit of his
argument and as he referred to each
particular president some delegate
would call: "What did he do?"
"lie settled the trouble by nego
tiation," was the reply which Olynn
Invariably returned and the conven
tion would roar its approval. William
J. Itryan, as a iiewHoapjir correspond
ent In the press sfaiiJ, wept with emo
tion as Olynn pictured the victories of
peace, but ho lauiihed with the crowd
when a Texas delegate. Interrupting
Olynn, leaped to his chair and cried:
"And don't forget that policy also
is satisfactory to William J. Itryan."
Predicts Ke-i-lc-e-tiem.
Aside from a Hl-minute demonstra
tion when chairman Olynn predicted
1 'resident Wilson's re-election. Olynn's
speech was sprinkled with demonstra
tions which he found It difficult to
stem so he could go on. It was plain
that thii telling points on the dele
gates were Hie recital of I'resident
Wilson's effort to keep the country
at peace.
"This policy," he said, "may not
satisfy the fireeater and the swash
buckler. Hut it does satisfy the
mothers of the land at whoso hearth
and fireside no jingoistic war has
placed an empty chair. It does satisfy
the daughters of this land from whom
bluster and brag have sent no loving
brother to thu dissolution of the grave.
It does satisfy the fathers of this land
and the sons of this land who will
fight for our flag and die for our flag
when reason primes the rifle; when
honor draws the sword and when Jus
tico breathes a blessing on the stand
ard they uphold."
The last of the words were drowned
nut in a roar of applause that swept
the Coliseum.
"Repeat it," cried tho delegates,
"repeat it!"
"All right, he quiet and I'll repeat
it," responded Olynn, and ho did. to
applause and cheering.
Fatvd Crucial Problems.
No other president since the civh
war. Olynn told the convention, had
iced such crucial problems, none had
displayed n grasp of statesmanship
more profound.
"Whether the course the country
has pursued during this crucial period
Is to be continued, and whether the
principles that have been asserted us
our national policy shall be Indorsed
or withdrawn," Olynn told the con
vention, wu the paramount question
for the voter to decide.
'"No lesser Issue must cloud It,"
said he; "no unrelated problems must
confuse It."
After hearing the keynote speech
the convention adjourned until 11
o'clock tomorrow. Committees then
went into session to prepare theli
work for the convention.
Passed Ooldcn Luno.
Today the big Coliseum, holding
about twelve thousand people, was
practically filled and. despite a con
stantly rising temperature, it was
fairly comfortable, on their wav to
the convention hall the delegates
passed between lines of suffragets
spread along twelve blocks of Locust
street, the most traveled route to the
Coliseum.
The suffragets, seated on chairs
ranged along the curbs, were arrayed
in white and yellow end held yellow
parasols. The waving lines of yellow
gave the demonstration the popular
Dame, "Golden lane".

successful operation of the war Is
being pressed along the whole front in
Volhynia and in Hiikowinu. Having
cut the railway communication of
Czernowitz from the north, the Rus
sians have carried the fiKhling into
the city's very outskirts. its fill is
momentarily expected.
At the same time the extreme right
flank of Ocncral lirusiloff's force is
swinging out toward Kovel, another
important railways Junction control
ling communication with Romberg
from the north. The Russians ap
proaching Kovel from the southwest
along the Rovno-Kovel railway have
reached the Stokod river, twenty miles
from Kovel. Southward of Kovel they
have pushed a wedge westward to
Tot chin. In the direction of Vladimir
Volynskl. This piercing of the Aus
trian line places the right flank of
Prince Leopold's army In a precarious
situation. A particularly stubborn de
fense is being made by the enemy in
the Kovel district advanced positions.
I let rout In Haste.
At many intermedite points between
the northern and southern points of
contact the Austrlans are reported to
be retreating so hastily that they are
out of touch with the Russians.
It Is rumored that the Austrians
are evacuating Lemberx.
The ruse practiced by Russians at
the beginning of the present opera
tions is described as follows:
"The Russians opened with severe
cannon fire which continued for sev
eral hours and then suddenly ceased.
The Austrians from past experience
expected an attack, which they pre
pared to meet, advancing machine
guns and bomb throwers, bringing up
troops and even preparing cavalry for
a charge. These preparations were
watched by Russian observers.
I'Nillowcil Austrians.
When the stage was properly set
instead of the expected advance, tho
Russians let loosu another shower of
shells much more violent than any of
the previous ones, causing terrific
slaughter anil demoralization in the
opposing ranks, on the heels of which
they began a forward movement. The
small number of commanding officers
captured In proportion to the number
of soldiers is attributed by military ex
perts to the confusion existing in the
Austrian armies, duo to the sudden
ness and energy of the Russian drive.
It shows. It Is argued, that the officers
lost control of the men ond abandoned
them to their fato at critical moments.

that fie presence of American troops

and perhaps a lesser one. among those

The real key to the situation, many

It is evident thai many officials
believe the collapse of the de facto

than any overt act by that govern

of such a collapse, however, it Is

suffered a heart attack were allayed
tonight when be received several
nowspa per cor respond ell Is.
Colonel Roosevell explained that
he contracted a severe cold while ro
tiirning several months ago I rum the
West Indies, and that at intervals
since then he had been subjected to
coughing spells, one of these occurred
this morning when he and Mrs.
"Roosevelt motored to a steamship
pier to 'ucel. Kerinit Roosevelt and
tho latter x wife, who returned iron.

The former president left the party
at the pier and sought a throat spe
cialist, lr K. W. Caldwell, who sum
toiimht :
"There does not seem any possibit
chance of serious discomfort to the
patient."
I'lics- Worn.
Colonel Roosevlt was in excellent
humor, but his la.. appeared worn
and haggard. Asked If he were in
pain, he replied that the cpieslion re
minded him of a picture he once had
seen In a humorous in.if i.ine wherein
a timid rider wis depicted as alsiut
to mount a shying horse. The rider,
the colonel said, turned to the groom
and inquired whither the horse was
"(iiiet".
"Perfectly cpiu't," the groom an
swered, "if you don't cough or sneeze
or touch your h it."
Hailicr in the day Colonel Roose
velt gave out a statement in which ho
rh.ii -ac.tert7.ed his indisposition as
"ridiculous, but painful,'' adding "so,
liko King Agag, I arch my nock and
walk lightly." Several of Hie newspa
per correspondents later informed the
colonel that tiny had experienced
some difficulty In finding the emula
tion. Quilling; Illble.
"Well." he replied, "it Is in the first
book of Samuel, which reminds me
that Samuel was a very good war cor
respondent." The former president chuckled and
said he believed ho had prompted
biblical reading to a greater extent
than any other man ot the country.
Colonel Roosevelt again refused to
discuss luilitics. ' He said, however,
that afte lunching with Raymond
Robins, who was chairman of the
Progressive national convention, and
Harold Ickes, national commit Iceman
for Illinois, ho had received (iov.
Hiram Johnson of California in his
rooms and that they talked fur an
hour.
Colonel Roosevelt also saw Lucieri
Kouheur, a prominent local Progres
sive, who later gave out a statement
in which he declared that "friends of
Colonel Roosevelt aro incensed be
cause certain members of the Progres
sive party have been saying that
