LONDON. Juno 15. Scads ami
tlirills -enough to make the wildest
dreams of a movie hero pale to insig-
nificance -have been packed into the
oung life of Lieutenant Clifford Pro
ber!, 17 cars old. Tlie full story came
today from Blaenavon, Wales, Pro
ber's native ullage. Daring deeds
under lire promotion from the ranks,
awarded the I) S. O, wounded tvvent
two times, blown up while on a hos
pital ship and lapse of memorj are a
few of the joutliful soldier's experi
ences. Uefore the war oung 1'iobert oper
ated a haulage engine in a coal mine
and was assistant thief boy scput of
the district In September 191 J, he
joined the arm bj misrepresenting his
age to a recruiting sergeant. He told
the sergiant he was IS when he was
only l." His parents objected to his
militarism so he changed his name to
William Gordon Williams.
(.'els Baptism of Fire.
At hill CO in Northern France, the
joutliful soldier received his baptism
of lire He also went to the hospital
for twehe weeks with two wounds in
his head and two in his legs. Some
time after he had rejoined his regi
ment, the commanding colonel decided
that a distant tower was being used as
an anemj observation post. The col
onel chose two men to cut the wires
that connected the tower with eneni
batteries The men chosen w ere lieu
tenant Murphy and Williams (Pro
ber!) After crawling 2u0 jards in the
dark, lij the direction of the tower.
Murphy was shot through the head
Probi-rt crawled forward and cvemtual
ly arrived. He dug in the ground
around the tower with his hands for
an hour before he discovered the
wires.
There were seventeen, which meant
that seventeen German batteries .vere
being accuratelj informed of the ac
curacy of their rillc fire on the British
K)sitions. Probert tried to snip the
wires with his pocket knife. The me
tallic sound produced, however, made
the operation dangerous and lit
searchid his Bed Cross packet for
vaseline. Smearing the oil on the
wires, lie spent several hours in nolse
lesslv tutting all seventeen and then
crawled back to the British trenches.
Wounded h) Kxploilintr Shell.
It was on September 25, the start
of the big British offensive, that the
voung trooper again got into action.
Ills regiment charged A handful
reached the third line German
trenches.
Probert was one of the handful. A
shell exploded nearby and threw him
into the air. Dazed and suffering from
shock he arose and charged again but
came under the fire of a machine gun
and fell with five bullet wounds in his
abdomen, both hips riddled and his
head badlv battered He lay in the
open, without attention, for two days
before stretcher bearers came along.
Probert hovered between life and
death in a base hospital for weeks.
Youth and vitality finally conquered
until he had sufficiently recovered
strength to be sent to England.
Subsequent!, with other wounded
men, he was taken to Boulogne and
Placed aboard the hospital ship, Ang
ha. The Anglia was half way across
the English channel on the way to
Folkestone when she was mined. The
explosion occurred just as a nurse was
raising Probcrt's head to see the coast
of England
CcK Experience on Water.
The nuro and an orderly carried
Probert, cot and all, to the main decK
and, telling him to hold on tight, slid
him into the sea A rescuing destroy
er picked him up before he had swal
lowed too much sea water. Eventual
ly he arrived in an English hospital.
Here he was awarded the medal of the
D'stinsuishcd Service Order for gal
lantry and apprised of his promotion
to a lieutenancy
Weeks later Probert was well
enough to be discharged from the hos
pital. But he had not gone long be
bre something seemd to snap in his
'rain and wipe away his memory.
The oung officer finally was found
IntLondon, wandering. Someone rec
ognized him from his photograph pub
lished in a London newspaper.
It was not until he caught sight of
familiar scenes in his native village
that Probert regained his memory. He
hopes to rejoin his regiment in another
month.
"I want to get hack into the scrap
before it is all over," Probert is tell
ing his townmen up in Blaenavon,
Wales.

varied, ranging from the time and
work of .lohann Sebastian Bach to the
later compositions of more modern
writers.
The lirmcipal place on the opening
program is hold bv I.udwig Van Bee

SEVERAL FRATERNITY
HOUSES RENTED OUT
Sororities at M. U., Too, Are
Leaving Their Homes or
Taking Roomers.
SOCIAL LIFE HALTS
But Plans Are Being Made
for Receptions and Othtr
Entertainments.
Where is tho University's Greek
world in the summer time? Neither
in the realm of societ mo rlu the
realm of fashions arc the fraternities
and soroiities vieing with each other.
Many fraternit and sorority houses
are closed for the summer; others are
closed as far as the Greeks as an ex
clusive bod are coiuerncd.
While many of the members are re
maining for the Summer Session, their
existence is that of the usual Summer
Session student. Even their home life
is not that of a brotherhood or sister
hood. No more are there chats around
the family harth or meetings behind
closed doors. All their doings are
open to the public, and in many cases
their homes also.
Many of the houses are being rented
out for the summer. While several
members of the Pan-Hellenic group
are still holding down their respective
forts, they are not much in evidence
because of the overwhelming number
of non-fraternity students who are oc
cuping their rooms or sitting In ther
favorite rocking chairs.
Several of the fraternities have
members enough remaining for the
Summer Session so that they are able
to "keep house" and not be lonesome.
Seven members of the Phi Gamma Del
ta fraternity are residing peacefully at
the home on College avenue. Sigma Al
pha Epsilon, Kappa Alpha, Phi Kappa
PsI and Sigma Phi Epsilon are all at
home, with a small but Ioal group of
"housekeepers." The Delta Tau Delta
fraternity is at home with the extcp
tion of the third lloor. which has been
rented. The other houses are either
rented or closed down until next fall.
Five members of the Kapna Kappn
Gamma sororit are attending summer
school. These are staing at the chap
ter house.
Kappa Alpha Theta, Delta Gamma.
Alpha Delta Pi, Phi Mu and Delta Del
ta Delta, each with a few girls re
maining, have ceased to think of sor
ority affairs or else dare not think of
them out lend because of the number
of summer roomers tn their homes.
Pi Beta Phi. Alpha Phi and Chi Ome
ga are closed for the summer.
Yet in spite of all this damper which
tho summer atmosphere places on the
fraternity life, many rumors are float
ing about of a social breeze stirring
in which the fraternities and sororities
will be the force. Several will hold
open house in the next two weeks,
which will be followed by a series of
morning dances and picnics.

WEIRD SUICIDE PACT
COMES OUT IN TRIAL
James O'Brien Says He and
Sweetheart Agreed to
Kill Each Other. .
MURDER IS CHARGED
Beatrice Walker Found Dead
May 31 in Field Case
Starts Today.
Ity Hulled Press.
PROVIDENCE, June 1.1 A unique
and tiagic twist of Fate's "eternal
triangle" will be bared in the Superior
Court here to Jay. when James O'Brien,
a one-armed outh, is put on trial for
the murder of his sweetheart, Beatrice
Walter.
The crime for which O'Brien will be
tried was committed at midnight. May
SI. Beatrice Walter, a pretty little
IS-ear-old girl, was found dead in a
lonel.v Held near Field's Point, a bullet
wound in her breast.
O'Brien, witli whom she liaJ been
walking since carl in the evening told
the police a weird tale of a suicide
patt. and tlaims that Beatrice shot
herself with his revolver
"Wouldn't it be nice if we could die
together," are the words the girl is al
leged to have used. It is O'Brien's con
tention that he twice attempted to
shoot himself, after Beatrice sank dea I
at Ills feet, but that each time the bul
let struck his belt buckle and wa
dellected.
Suicide Incur; Scouted.
The police and Beatrice's parents
scout tlie suicide theory as ridiculous.
"It is murder, pure and simple,"
Chief Inspector 'ON'eil said today.
"The Walter girl's iiarents know of no
reason why she should wish to die."
It is in this connection, that the
"other man" enters into the case, w ith
evidence which may be damning to the
one-armed ycuth on trial for his life.
George S. Ijrkin, 22 cara old, has
bruht forward conclusive evidence
that he, and not O'Brien, was Beatrice
Walter's sweetheart. He has informed
the police that O'Brien twice made
threats to kill him. if he did not leave
Beatrice alone.
Testinioii) to He Important.
The testimony of this outh and that
of the medical examiner, who perform
ed an autopsy on the dead body, will
be of the greatest importance, and
may be the final weight which will
carry the scales of justice.
lames O'Brien is 21 ears old. He
works as a messenger boy in a jewel
ry store in Providence. He was In
love witli Beatrice Walter, pretty
daughter of a cit inspector. He was
known to be insanely jealous of her
and to resent the attentions of othei
nen, going so far as to threaten them,
and to carry a loaded revolver.
Night's Events Mjsfcrimis.
On the evening of May .11, O'Brien
and Beatrice Walter left her father's
house to walk through the woods.
What happened during the evening
may never be known, but about 4
o'clock tho next morning, the youth
entered the Walter home, aroused Wil
liam Walter, her father, and told him
that Beatrice had shot herself.
Led by O'Brien, the police and Wal
ter went to the lonely spot where she
lay. A bullet-wound beneath her leTt
breast and powder stains on her dress
showed that she had been shot at close
range.
O'Brien's revolver, five chambers
empty, was found near the spot. A
slight scraping wound in his abdomen,
and a dented belt buckle he offered as
evidence of his own attempts at sui
cide. He told of how Beatrice, taking his
revolver had fired the shot which end
ed her life. So confusing vvere parts
of his weird tale of the death pact,
that he was at once arrested, and ar
raigned, charged with murder, on the
second of June.

Charles H. 1 Wanted Job, And
rote u Mce Letter.
George H. Beasley, superintendent
of schools in Liberty, Mo , is telling
a tale of extreme absent-mindedness
at Marville, where he is teaching in
the summer session of the Maovil'e
Normal School.
Mr. Beasley received an application
for a place in his schools some time
ago from a graduate of the University
of Missouri. But the applicant had
omitted his signature.
The letter was, Mr. Beasley said,
well-written and in every way. admir
able, excopt for tho omission of the
name. The superintendent says that
he wrote to the address given in the
letter, and sent it to "The Absent
Minded Man" at that particular street
number. Then, curious to know who
the person might be, he wrote to the
references to get the name, and found
that Charles B. Woody, Tiger baseball
captain, had been too busy in the rush
of Commenccmont duties to sign his
name to his correspondence.
