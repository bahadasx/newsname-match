Another Well
Brought In
Good Producer Struck
on Farm of S. (?...
Baker.
The Olay City oil field receiv
ed another nice boost Wednesday
when B. A. Bonniville, drilling
on the S. G. Baker farm, about
three miles from town, on Hard
wicks creek, brought in a good
well that is estimated by the oil
men hero at about thirty barrels.
The oil in this well is theiighc
green quality, said to be the
best, at present worth over 2.00
a barrel.
Hoien & Sherman, who are
drilling on the Clark farm for
Oldendorf, Bonham & Clarke, of
Mt. Carmel, 111., have been de
layed by a breakdown in their
machine and will not reach the
sand until Saturday, They are
having good indications of oil,
however, and feel sure they .-will
strike a paying well. ,

expected to come in at any time,
as is the one on Slate creekr be
ing sunk by W. J. Williams.
These operations will prove up u
lot of territory and great confi
dence is being, expressed ' by oil
men in the field.
Several other rigs are enroute
to the field hero and most oHhe
operators now here are,, faking
over lenses with short tinie con
tracts for wells, with the result
that rigs are in great demacd.
There has been a number of
new arrivals here during'th'e'past
week and a thorough test of the
entire field is assured by the op
erators coming in. Every -train
brings men from other field, in
eluding Ohio, Illinois, Indiana,
and oven from Louisiana and
Oklahoma. The shallow wells
and the fine quality oNhe oil
combine to interest tht?e.'meu,
who are in fields where the aver
age depth of the wells is 2,000
feet, as against 800 feot.here.
