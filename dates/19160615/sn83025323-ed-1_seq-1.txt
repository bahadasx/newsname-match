MINNEAPOLIS VISITORS
ROYALLY ENTERTAINED
June seventh, 1916 will always
bear many plesant memories to our
citizens as it was the occasion of
the first western trip of the Minnea
polis Civic and Commerce associa
tion and Malta was honored by hav
ing this distinguished crowd remain
in the city over night.
Promptly at 6:30 the big special
pulled into the depot and was park
ed on the track just south of the sta
'tion. The Malta band and over two
thousand people were on hand to
welcome the tourists. A represent
ative of this paper met the train at
Ashfield and distrubited copies of
the big booster edition which was
well recleved. The visitors were all
more than pleased with their recep
tion here and John A. Tressler de
livered a short address of welcome
from the frount of the engine of the
train and was responed to on behalf
of the Minneapolis crowd by one of
their best speakers, Mr. Asher How

cars furnished by our citizens after
which a bucking contest took place.
This amused the visitors more than
anything else. In the meantime
Fifth ayenue had been roped off and
the Roesster First Regimient band
gave a concert lasting one and one
half hours on the bank corner. They
are without a doubt one of the fin
est bands ever heard in the west and
not only that but they are a fine
bunch to meet personally.
Shortly after eight o'clock danc
ing commenced at the Bison and
continued until four o'clock next
morning. Minneapolis guests were
furnished tickets to the dance and
about fifty of the visitors were pre
sent. The boxing match was pulled
off at the woolhouse shortly after
nine o'clock and was a fair bout but
not what it would have been had
not some of our busy bodies about
the city got busy wireing state offi
cials to stop the go. The promoters
have the satisfaction that they had
over three- fourths of the most re
spectable people in Malta back of
them and also that they went 1
in through with it in MiAte of the

G. W. ]KRAMIA PURCHASES
HOTEL AT ROUNDUP
Some time ago this paper an
nounced that G. W. Kramm had pur
chased a hotel at Choteau, but this
proved erroneous. Hlowever Mr.
Kramm and his brother Charles
Kramm, have hecome interested in a
sale at Roundup, Mont., and Mr. and
Mrs Kramm and Miss Adeline, left
for their new home Saturday even
ing.
The Roundup Tribune has the fol
lowing account of the transfer:
The Palace hotel was purchased
by Charles Kramm of White Sul
phur Springs and G1. W. Kramm of
Malta, the latter a hotel man of 15
years' experience. The brothers
took charge Saturday. The transfer
has not, however, been completed
and will not be until Mrs. Chas.
Bookman returns to the city.. Tho
new proprietors hesitate to discuss
their plans for the future, but an
nounce that the hotel will continue
to cater to high class trade and that e
every accommodation will be fur
nished the traveling public.
It is not yet known whether Mr.
Brookman's plans for building an
addition will be oarried out, altho a
the urgent need of more hotel room
is recognized. Gi. W. Kramm is now a
at Malta closing up his affairs there
and no statement concerning the in
tention of the new owners will be 1
made until he arrives with his fain
ily.
