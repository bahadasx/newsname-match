Street Width.
The following street widths were
decided upon: Forty-eight feet wide:
Main, Washington to Ninth Broad­
way, Washingtoh to Ninth Thayer,
Second to Ninth. Rosser, Second to
Ninth. Fourth street will be forty
four feet wide. All other streets will
be uniformly twenty-five wide.
It was decided to pave all the allies
down town in the area bounded by
Main and Broadway and Second and
Sixth streets.
A necessary improvement is a sur­
face storm sewer system. City Engi
rieer Atkinson presented a tentative
plan. This was revised and the sys­
tem decided upon comprises a large
main sewer on Rdsser from Fourth to
Mandan, south to Broadway to con­
nect with the main sewera* smaller
sewer on Seventh or Eighth from the
Baulevard to Broadway, the' Ninth from
Aventie to Broadway. A trunk sew­
er on Broadway to take the drainage
from these streets. This sewer would
run 6s far as Thirteenth' Street and
carry "the water td Eighth. There it
wotild pass under the Northern Pacific
tracks, providing an outlet to the riv­
er botoms.
Improvement Warrants.
It was thought that the improve­
ment warrants, the methods to be
used to finance *he j:aving improve­
ment, could be floated at five percent
payable in yearly installments for a
period of twenty years.
The state board of control has of­
fered to co-operate with the city. It.
will rebuild the capitol car line and
pave a foot and a half on each side
of the track. The state promises to
keep ahead of the paving crew and
finish its work in ample time.
Although there is serious doubt as
to the power of the city to order the
wires off the streets, it was decided
to pass an ordinance providing for
their removal within a period of two
years. The city commission met last
evening and adjourned until the regu­
lar meeting Monday evening.

the City hall and fixed the streets named above aS'the paving dist­
ricts. This action will be confirmed at an early meeting of the
commission so that plans and specifications can be prepared and
bids called for within a few weeks. It is planned to pave all of
district one before the snow flies ai)d Sixth street, to the capitol
boulevard so that there will be a paved aveneue to the State
house...
u.-.--
CUT DOWN STREET WIDTH.
In cutting down the width of the streets to twenty-five feet in
district One, or a major portion of it, the cost, of paving will be
reduced ten per cent. This* is the practice in all large cities in
such portions where a street of this width can care for the traf­
fic. There was considerable discussion over this point, but it was
finally compromied at twenty-five feet. The rest of the street will
be' thrown into the boulevard and when the improvement is com­
plete, will add greatly to the beauty of the city.

•Minneapolis, Minn., June 14.—-Sen­
sation after sensation featured to­
day's session of the third trial of
Joseph W. Bragdon.
When Joseph Lick asserted that
Madge iRolands, who is the state's
chief witness, had a "rotten" reputa­
tion, Frank 'Rolands, the woman's
husband, rushed at him with clinched
fists, but the bailiff prevented an en­
counter. As he was placed in charge
of the sheriff, Lick shouted that Ro­
lands also had a "rotten" reputation.
He was fined |5 by the court and
warned that another outbreak would
cause him to go to jail. Eragdon
made a blanket denial of the charges
of bribery made by the Rolands, wit1*
regard to the disappearance of th*
three girl witnesses, and the accusa­
tion of criminal attacks on school
girls.
He admitted, however, that he knew
of the escape of the three girls, and
proposed to see them, but lje' vas ad­

BIG PREPAREDNESS
PARADE IS SETTING
Is Aroused Over the Opposition
to His Re-Eltrtio.n in- Cap­

Washington, June 14.—A charge
that foreign born citizens of the Unit­
ed States arc trying to levy political
blackmail and undermine the influ­
ence of the national government was
made by 'President Wilson in a
speech here today, (lis assertion start­
ed the keynote of one of the fore­
most issues on which he will go be­
fore the country for re-election, and
touched upon a platform declaration
•which will be SIIlimited 'by the admin­
istration to the
Louis convention.
The president spoke before a crowd
of thousands gathered at the foot of
the Washington monument, after he
had viewed a great preparedness par­
ade, at the head of which he bad
marched down Pennsylvania aventie.
He declared that not since the Civil
war had it been tested as it now is
'being tested whether the stars and
stripes stood for ane united purpose
Disloyalty Active.
"There is disloyalty active in the
United States, and it must be abso­
lutely crushed," declared the presi­
dent, speaking emphatically. "It pre­
cedes from a minority, a very small
minority, but a very subtle minority.
"It works underground, but it also
shows its ugly head where we can see
it. There are :ose at this moment
who are trying to levy a species of
political blackmail, saying, 'do what
we wish in the interest of foreign sen
timents, or we will wreck our venge­
ance at the polls.
Loyalty to Flag.
That is the sort of thing against
which the American nation will turn
with might and triumph of sentiment
which will teach these gentlemen
once for all that loyalty to the flag is
the first test in the United States.
The president's -word was taken as
an open challenge to foreign-Ameri­
cans, "who he had learned are working
against his re-election.
While the Democratic convention
was being opened at St. Louis, Mr.
Wilson devoted the entire day to the
flag day and preparedness demonstra­
tion. Carrying a large American flag
he walked from the Capitol to the
White House at the head of many
high officials and other employees of
the government, and capital business
houses, and Union and Confederates
and social organizations.
Cabinet Members Walk.
The parade started from the Capi­
tol grounds and as it. passed the White
House, the president dropped out and
took his place at the head reviewing
stand. He was joined there 'by Secre­
tary McAdoo, Redfield, Lane and Wil­
son, Postmaster General Burleson
and Attorney General Gregory, who
had walked at the head- of employees
of their departments.
As soon as the last marchers passed
the stand, the president went to the
Monument grounds, where he spoke
in the patriotic exercises.
Almost every man and woman in
the audience carried an American
flag. Before he began speaking a
canon fired a salute of 21 guns, and
the Star Spangled Banner was played.
Secretary L'nising pi'. sided, and in in­
troducing the president emphasized

CALM LINE
Drive Threatens Safety of
Bombardment.
London, June 14.—An advance of 20
miles by the 'Russians who have Czer
nowitz as their obective, is chronicled
jn the latest Russian oflijeial commun­
ication. Having previously crossed
the Dniester river and taken Horod
enka and Zale Szczyky, the Russians
have now driven their men to the
left bank of the river Pruth and cap­
tured Sniatyn, only 20 miles north­
west of the Bukowina capital.
No Cessation.
Nowhere on the front, from the
Pripet river in Russia and through Ga
licia to Bukowina, has there been any
cessation in the great Russian of­
fensive. Along the entire line, accord­
ing to the Russian war office, the Aus
tro-Hnngarians and Germans are be­
ing driven back and the Russians are
taking thousands of prisoners and
capturing guns, machine guns and
war supplies. In the 11 days' drive,
1,780 officers and 120,000 men ant?
1'lt) guns and 200 machine guns ha\f.
been captured.
Efforts Failed.
On the lower end of the German
line in .Russia, north of Baranovichi,
the Russians evidently have. antici­
pated the proposed' German offensive
and taken the initiative.. There, aTler
violent artillery preparation, they sev­
en times essayed to storm German
lines. Berlin says, however, that all
their efforts failed and that they were
repulsed with heavy losses.
Verdun Attack Lessens.
Fighting around Verdun has dwin­
dled to intermittent, bombardments.
The Canadians around Zillibeke in
'Belgium are holding to the 1,500- yards
of ground recaptured from the Ger­
mans Tuesday, although the Germans
are heavily shelling them.
The latest advices from the Aus
tro-ltalian war theatre credit the Ital­
ians with repulsing violent Austrian,
attacks on the Posina front northwest
of Schio. The German auxiliary cruis­
er, llerzmann, has been attacked and
sunk in the Baltic Sea. southeast of
Stockholm, by four Russian torpedo
boat destroyers, according to Berlin.
It is anticipated in London t,hat
David Lloyd-George will take the
place of the late Karl Kitchener, ."as
British secretary of stale for war.

Girls Will Take Stand.
With reference to the state's con­
tention that the poison was liquid, and
therefore must have been brought in­

EXPECT PLANK WILL BE
INSERTED IN PLATFORM
St. Louis, June 14.—The suffragists'
fight for an equal rights plank in the
Democratic platform closed today
with the "Golden Lane" demonstration
and tonight all camps began their fin­
al drive on members of the resolu­
tions committee and three cabinet
members, Secretary's Baker, Daniels
and Houston, who are here.
Hope for victory never was bright­
er with the suffragists, for the con­
viction that, the platform will favor
their movements grows hourly. The
big question now is what form the
plank will take. Whether it will, be
stronger than that, contained in the
Republican platform cannot be fore­
casted until the committee takes final
action.
President. Wilson, among others,
has submitted a plank to the commit­
tee, but tonight it* was said that there
was much doubt if it would be writ­
ten into the platform. While the com­
mittee had not passed formally on the
president's plank, the opinion was ex­
pressed by several members that it
was not specific enough to be effect­
ive.
A plank approved by Secretary Dan.
iels also has found opposition in the
National American Woman Suffrage
association, because it is considered
too long. Its text, declaring in favor
of immediate passage by congress of
a constitutional amendment, however,
is favored by both the National and
the Womans party.
Representative Baker of California,
a member of the committee, said to­
night that he was trying to assemble
ideas of all suffragists and express
them in a plank, which he would offer

lie went down the list of presidents,
recounting theft actions to avoid war.
The delegates caught the spirit of
his arguments and as he referred tA
each particular president, dome dele­
gate would call:
"WJiat did ho do?"
"He settled the trouble by negoife
tions," was the reply which Glynn in­
variably returned, and the convention,
woulu roar its approval.
Bryan Weeps For Peace.
Wm. J. Bryan, as a newspaper cor­
respondent in the Press stand, wept
with emotion as Glynn pictured tie
victories of peace, but laughed with
the crowd when a Texas delegate
leaped to his chair and cried:
"And don't forget that policy is also
satisfactory to Wm. J. Bryan."
Aside from a 15-minute demonstpb
tion, when Chairman Glynn predicted
Wilson's re-election, Glynn's speech
was sprinkled with demonstrations
which he found it difficult to stem so
he could go on.
It. was plain that the telling point
on the delegates was the reciting of
the efforts of Wilson to keep the
country at peace.
Satisfies the Mothers.
"This policy," he said, "may not
satisfy the fire-eater and swashbuck­
ler. But it does satisfy the mothers
of the land, at whose hearth anff Tire
sides no was has placed an empty
chair. It does satisfy the daughters
of this land, from whom bluster aiM
brag may send no loving brother to

satisfy the fathers of this land, and
the sons of this land who will tight
for our flag and die for our flag when
reason primes, the rifles and when
honor draws the sword, and when jus­
tice breathes a blessing on the stab­
ard they uphold."
The last of the words-were drownld
out in a roar of applause that swefrt-
Profound Statesmanship.
/No other president since the CiVlt
war, Glynn told the convention, had
faced such crucial problems, none had
displayed statesmanship more pro*
found.
"Whether the course the country
has pursued during this crucial peri*
od is to be continued fend whether
the principles that have been assert*

convention, "was the paramount ques*

confuse it."
