New Super-Dreadnaught Said to Be t<
Most Powerful Afloat. u
o
\ Norfolk", Vaf, June 12.?The super- r<
1 * dreadnaught Pennsylvania arrived E
i from the yards of the Newport News ^
| Shipbuilding and Dry Dock comf
pany, her builders, this morning to
~ be placed in commission at the navy p
yard this afternoon. She ? will be c<
commanded by Capt. H. B. Wilson.
* It is expected that the ship will be v
at the local yard about ten days, pro- n
ceeding from here to Philadelphia, p
. where she will receive the set of sil- ll
ver plate to be presented. ^
American naval experts claim that ^
the Pennsylvania is the most power- c
r%
Pfttl warship afloat. Her main bat- ?
i,
tery consists of twelve 14-inch rifles, 11
arranged in four turrets on the centre
^ line. Two of the turrets are so elevated
that the ship has a dead ahead ^
fire of six of the big buns and a like
f fire dead astern. In the secondary,
or torpedo boat defence battery, arranged
along the main and upper
I decks, are twenty-two 5-inch rapid- ^
fire rifles. There also are four 21inch
torpedo tubes.
The Pennsylvania is equipped* with
two armored decks to protect her
vitals from indirect shell fire. The
v
> upper deck is of special steel two
inches thick and the main deck is .
i]
three inches thick. The outboard ar'
n
^ mor consists of a partial belt extend1

IU.& liUUX WC11 uwun l/UV ffMTVV* | ^
to the main deck and is fourteen
inches thick amidships, tapering to ^
eight inches at each end. The armor
on the turrets varies from eighteen
inches to eight inches in thickness,
with five-inch armor on top. The ^
barbette armor below decks is thirteen
inches thick. The funnel base ,
D
is protected by thirteen-inch armor,
and that of the conning tower, from
which the ship would be operated in
battle, is of the same thickness.
The Pennsylvania is 608 feet long '
over all, has a full load displacement
of about 32,000 tons and her speed ^
on trials was slightly in excess of
. twenty-one knots an hour. She was
contracted for in October, 10, 1913,
and was launched at Newport News ^
fifteen months ago. .

SHOOTING AFFAIR AT AIKEN.
D. Chester Boyd Desperately Wounded
in His Own House.
Aiken, June 7.?An unfortunate
shooting affair occurred in this city
last night about 10 o'clock, as a result
of which D. Chester Boyd lies
desperately wounded at the sanitarium
of Dr. Harry H. Wyman, with
a pi6tol bullet through his intestines
and one through his lungs.
The shooting occurred at the home
of Mr. Boyd on Newberry street. It
is reported that his little sister-inlaw,
Miss Inez Berry, is held responsible
for the shooting. There are
several reports as to the cause of
the shooting, but the one that is
generally believed is that there was
' "1? * Dfturw trtnl?
a iamny iuss, auu iuiss ucn;
the part of her sister, Mrs. Boyd.
Miss Berry is said to have secured
Mr. Boyd's pistol and fired at him a
number of times. Two shots took
effect, one in the breast and one in
the side. An operation was performed
on the wounded n^n this morning,
and it was found that his intestines
were punctured in two
places, and one shot penetrated the
lungs. There are grave fears expressed
for his recovery.
Mr. Boyd has charge of the Aiken
motor fire truck, and is well known,
having run a garage here for years.
HEAVY LOSS BY LIGHTING.
Calhoun County Farmer Loses Barn
During Storm.
St. Matthews, June 7.?Last night
about midnight, while the electrical
storm was at its height and the rain
was pouring heaviest, lightning
struck and set on fire the barn of T.
A. Amaker, resulting in a total loss.
In the barn was stored all of Mr.
Amaker's recently harvested oat
crop, amounting to about $2,000.
Housed in the lower story were sixteen
mules and forty hogs, which
* 1 xV _ ~ .. J /il. (nnnf Vl mi trV>f
were saveo. Dy m w luicmuugm
of Dixon Whetstone. Mr. Whetstone
had just gone home and just at the
moment the lightning struck, happened
to be looking in the direction of
the barn. He saw the stroke and in
a few moments saw the flames burst
from the building. He dashed upon
the scene, opened doors and ran the
mules and hogs out. The fire companies
did good work in saving all
nearby buildings. Mr, Amaker's loss
including building, will be about $2,500,
with no insurance.
HONOLULU.
First Ipipression of the Hawaiian
Islands.
To most people who have never
been to the islands, and who have
never contemplated going there long
enough to get ujya Hawaiian dossier,
writes Katharine F. Gerould, in
Scribner, the name of Honolulu suggests,
perhaps, half a dozen things:
Sugar, surf-riding, volcanoes, lels,
missionaries and poi. * * * Certainly
we knew originally little more
than the list suggests. But knowledge
somehow bursts upon one when
one is contemplating a specific jour.
ney. The detached air of the steamship
clerk and the railway agent
breed in one a kind of knowingness.
Long before we saw Diamond Head
we had made a hundred traveller's
choices, and could be glib ourselves
about island problems. We had
made out not only that Honolulu
was the tourist's paradise?our luggage
labels said so?but also that it
was a paradise with a grievance.
Free sugar, the seaman's bill, the
prevailing yello^ tinge of the population,
and the perishing Kanaka,
, were all familiar formulae before a
single maile wreath had been flung
about our necks. There were island
1 ~ .+Aniviflp> onH wViorpvpr
ptSUpiW UJLl Lilt? Sicauiui , uuu H ??v. v .
island people are met together, to
pass the - time or to instruct the
stranger, island problems are hot in
the mouth. To talk about the insularity
of an island is to be tautological;
but the insular American
on Oahu is more insular, so to speak,
thap the insular Englishman in London.
England is the centre of an empire;
but Hawaii is the mere outpost
of a republic, a territory, something
as helpless in the hands of congress
as a ward in chancery is helpless;
bent, therefore, on self-preservation
solely, and on keeping up its own little
state and luxury in its own midPacific
Eden.*

BUSHES AND ROOSEVELT
REPUBLICAN AND PROGRESSIVE
NOMINEES.
Roosevelt Declines the Nomination.
Democrats Disappointed That
Roosevelt Will Not Run.
Chicago, June 10.?The Republican
national convention today nominated
Charles Evans Hughes, of New
York, and Charles W. Fairbanks^ of
Indiana, as the candidates of their
party for president and vice president.
Almost at the same moment Theo
dore Roosevelt was nominated by the
national Progressive convention, and
later in the day John M. Parker, of
Louisiana, was named as running
mate.
The Republican nomination required
a ballot, the third of the convention,
while the Progressive nomination
was made by acclamation.
Mr. Roosevelt's provisional declination
to accept the Progressive
nomination is believed by the politically
wise to leave the door ajar, if
not wide open, for eventual withdrawal
of the third ticket in the
event Mr. Hughes's position on what
the Progressives feel to be the vital
issues of the campaign meet their
approval. To this extent, at least,
the leaders in both parties feel that
the efforts at harmony, even if not
directly fruitful of result,. may yet
be realized.
Hughes and Fairbanks.
Chicago, June 10.?Charles Evans
Hughes, former governor o^ New
York, and associate justice of the supreme
court, was nominated today
for the presidency by the Republican
national convention.
Charles Warren Fairbanks, of Indiana,
elected vice president with
Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, again
was chosen for second place on the
Republican ticket.
Both nominations, made by overwhelming
majorities on the first ballot
of the day?the third ballot of the
convention for the presidency?were,
by acclamation, made unanimous.
Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts,
presented by Col. Roosevelt as a compromise
candidate, received seven
votes. Col. Roosevelt himself received
eighteen and one-half, scattered
over twelve States.
The nominating ballot showed this
count: Hughes, 949 1-2; Roosevelt,
18 1-2; Lodge 7; DuPont, 5; Weeks,
3; LaFollette, 3; absent 1. Total,
987.
Although Frank H. Hitchcock,
leader of the Hughes supporters, let
it be known that the Hughes men
wanted Burton for second place,
Ohio withdrew Burton's name, leaving
the field to Mr. Fairbanks and
former Senator Burkett, of Nebraska.
The ballot for vice president showed
this count:
Fairbanks, 863; Burkett, 108;
Borah, 8; Burton, 1; Johnson, 1;
absent, scattering and not voting, 6.
Total, 987.
Roosevelt and Parker.
Chicago, June 10.?The Progressive
national convention, after four
days' tumult with only one purpose
in view, today nominated Col. Roosevelt
for president and a few hours
later listened without protest to a
message from Oyster Bay that he
would not "accept at this time." The
convention adjourned at 4:58 p. m.
Col. Roosevelt's declination was
conditional and it was placed in the
hands of the Progressive national
+ Kfl Vialr? until cilr>V) timp
VJlflLlUlillCC IU UC u^iu uui.1t uuuu vitiiw
as statements to be issued by Justice
Hughes, the nominee of the Republican
party, "shall satisfy the committee
that it is for the interest of
the country that he be elected."
In the event the committee shall
be satisfied that aid should be given
to the Republican party Col. Roosevelt's
refusal to make a campaign is
to be considered final. It will then
be authorized for the representatives
of the Progressive party to say
whether to endorse the position tak
en by Mr. Roosevelt or whether they
will name another man to fight for
their party principles.
John M. Parker, of Louisiana, was
nominated for vice president, the selection
being by acclamation.
Out of Politics, Says T. R.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., June 11.?Theodore
Roosevelt reiterated tonight
that he is "out of politics."
"I want to tell you newspaper
men," he said, "that it's of no use
for you to come up here to see me.
I will have nothing to say. I will
answer no questions, please don't
ask me to. I am out of politics."

this morning with Mrs. Roosevelt,
but remained in seclusion at Sagamore
Hill the remainder of the day.
The telegraph lines brought him a
flood of messages and it ,was announced
that most of them approved
his action in declining to become a
candidate upon the Progressive
ticket.
While Col. Roosevelt would not
discuss the qiiestion today, his intimates
considered it altogether unlikely
that he would reconsider his
conditional refusal to head a third
ticket. He has not yet made it clear
whether or not he will support the
Hughes candidacy.
-M
Democrats Sorry.
Washington, June 10.?News of
Col. Roosevelt's refusal to head a
third ticket came like a thunderbolt
to President Wilson's supporters.
They had hoped earnestly that both
Hughes and Roosevelt would run.
While no statement was forthcom
ing from the white house, there was
no mistaking the gloom that supplanted
the optimism caused by the
earlier reports that two tickets had
been named. The president's closest
friends would make no statement as
to his feelings, but they were plainly
downcast over the course decided
upon by Col. Roosevelt.
"Hughes will be much easier to
beat than Roosevelt," said Senator
Ollie James, who will be the permanent
chairman of the St. Louis convention.
Uppermost in the mind of the president's
friends was the question of
what Col. Roosevelt would do or
have done for him. When Hughes
was nominated white house officials
and callers turned their interest to
the Bull Moose convention to see if
Roosevelt would be nominated.
