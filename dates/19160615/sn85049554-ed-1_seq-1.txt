The association of "hoboes" sent a

ception when he arrived. Delegates
and galleries joined in cheers and ap
plause.
While the delegates waited the word
went around that the rules committee
would recommend that nominations be
made tonight. It was welcome news to
many of the delegates* who have not
relished remaining until Saturday.
However, the plan to adopt the plat
form after the nominations are made,
as was done in Baltimore four years
ago, was counted on to fulfill tha
promises of the managers to the city
of St. Louis for a four-day convention.
Glynn Loudly Cheered,
It was exactly 11:45 when Tempo
rary Chairman Glynn called the con
vention to order. The delegates, still
bubbling over .with enthusiasm from
his speech of yesterday, gave him a
rousing reception.
Archbishop John Glennon, of St.
Louis, then offered prayer.
The credentials committee then re
ported on the delegate contests from
Washington, D. C., ^orto Rico and
Hawaii. The delegates from the Dis
trict of Columbia and Hawaii were rec
ognized and placed on the rolls by the
national committee. Porto Rico was
divided between the contesting dele
gates.
The announcement of names of per
manent oonvention officers was
cheered.
Delegate Norman E. Mack, of New
York Governor^. V. Stewart, of Mon
tana, and Senator Phelan, of Califor
nia, composed the committee which es
corted Senator James to the chair.
SeiULtor James launched Into his
ppej^red speech- It was punctuated
by appltm*.
[Senator James' speech appears on
page 4 of this issue—Editpr.]
Speech Vigorously Applauded.
When Mr. James recounted the hor
rors of war and the president's efforts
to preserve peace, Mr. Bryan rose to
his feet "and applauded vigorously.
When James recounted the presi
dent's diplomatic successes in the ne
gotiations with Germany the delegates
wanted to hear it again. James repeat
ed his statement and the crowd rose
and broke loose in cheers.
In concluding his speech, the senator
said:
"Woodrow Wilson, without orphaning
a single child, without widowing a wife,
without firing a single gun, without
shedding a single drop of blood, wrung
from the most military spirit that ever
brooded above a battlefield, an agree
merit to American demands and a con
cession',to American rights."
The band swung into "America" and
"The Star Spangled Banner." Hats
went into the air. Somebody cried,
"Three cheers for Wilaon!"
Stanchions were torn up and a inarch
thru the hall was started. The aisles
became choked because the demonstra
tion began without an organised leader.
After twelve mlautes the Kentucky
standard was taken to the platform and
placed behind Mr. James. It 'was a
signal for cheers for the speaker while
the band played "Dixie," followed by
"The BatUe Cry of Freedom."
The applaiise lasted eighteen iniii-
WTi^*K"TaiSrei» OftMed there were
more cheers and calls for "Bryan."
Aljouritme^t Until 9. P. M.
Chairman Glasgow presented the re
port of the committee on rules. It pro
vided among other things that no dele
gate shall speak more than twenty min
utes on any subject, that nominations
begin at 8 p. m., followed immediately
by nomination for vice president. Sen
ator Reed, of Missouri, moved that the
nominations be delayed until 9 p. m.,
as St. Louis business men had planned
entertainments for this evening. Mr.
Reed's motion carried.
It was not decided whether the plat
form would be presented before or aft
er nominations. At 1:22 p. m. a recess
was ordered. The motion was out of
respect to William P. Kasting, post
master of Buffalo, a delegate who died
suddenly this morning.

SHARP NOTE TO CARRANZA.
Will Show Resentment to Discourteous
Note of Carranza.
Washington, June 15.—Secretary
Lansing laid before President Wilson
toduy the completed draft of a note
to General -Carranza replying to tiie
•dfetiaantf that Am«rk:an troops be with
drawn from 'Mexico. The .president
and Mr. Lansing conferred at length
on the situation.
Unless some new development forces
the situation the reply will not he
sent until next week at the earliest.
The president desires to deal with
the note in such fashion that action
can not be attributed to domestic poli
tics.
It is said the note flatly refuses to
withdraw American troops from
Mexico until the Carranza government
shows its ability to police the bonier
properly. It makes sharp rejoinder to
the Mexican communication, which
officials regard as discourteous. It
openly hinted that President Wilson
had his eyes on the American politi
cal convention in dealing with the sit
uation on the border.
It is understood that the declaration
will be so framed that the de facto
government have no doubt that the
United States regards Its request
wholly unnecessary.
Carranza will be told that failure
of Mexican and American troops to
co-operate for the extermination of
bandits was due to the hostility and
suspicion exhibited by the Mexicans.

awakened by the shock as the Bear
lifted her bow on the foghldden rocks
nnd came to a Jolting stop. The pas

night clothes, the women soreaming in
terror. Great holes had been torn In
the steamer's bow plates by the Im
pact. but Captain Nopander after an
examination of the damage, assured the
passengers that there was no Immediate
