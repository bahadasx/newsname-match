stiggest the existence of a very trifling
estimate of tne sacredness and value
of numan life. It is hardlv consistent
j with sound reason to attribute this to
mental derangement or mere physical

of a sound moral sense has more to do
with this than anything, and that reck-
less and wanton destruction of human
life will continue to increase till this
moral sense which fs the safeguard of
the soul, is again enthroned. '

the individual, but hs moral sense and
apprecation of noble and lofty ideals
makes him a safe custodian of the life
and interests of his fellow men as well
as of his own life interests. There is,
therefore, little difference so far as
moral turpitude is concerned between
the man who takes his own life and
the one who takes the life of his fel
