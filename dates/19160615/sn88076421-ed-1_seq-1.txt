he is delighted with North Dakota as

"I have seen many beautiful sights,

week.
Summer school begins June 28. The
Model school will be in session again
this year, during the forenoon. It will
accommodate as many of the appli­
cants as seating capacity, and teach­
ing force will allow. The superintend­
ents of the Northwest district especi­
ally endorsed this department of the
summer school as meeting a distinct
need, while the large attendance the
past two years plainly showed the at­
titude of its patrons. For these rea­
sons mainly the Model School is con­
tinued.
The Normal School Information of­
fice has received but few notices as yet
regarding rooms for rent to Summer
school students. As the dormitory
rooms are at present all reserved for
those six weeks, there will undoubted­
ly be numerous applicants for rooms
in the city, as also boarding accommo­
dations. Those listing their rooms at
the Normal school will receive first
attention.
FIRST ANNUAL STOCK
SHOW IN JULY
FIRST ANNUAL EVENT TO BE
HELD AT MAMMOTH CURLING
RINK FIRST WEEK OF NEXT
MONTH.
For some time it has been apparent
that the Northwestern part of the
state of North Dakota was lacking in
one thing—the proper recognition of
the stock raising industry. Since the
earliest days of settlement this por­
tion of the state has been paying par­
ticular attention to the raising of
grain, but during the past few years
many of the progressive farmers have
been turning to livestock more and
more through the propaganda of di­
versified farming, until today there are
hundreds of our best husbandmen en­
gaged in at least a small way in the
improving of their herds. These men
need not only recognition but encour­
agement, and to that end the Minot
Association of Commerce has thought
it wise to start a series of livestock
shows, and hold the first one this year
during the first week in July.
For a number of years the Associa­
tion of Commerce has provided a Mid­
winter Fair. At first the exhibits in­
cluded, besides grains and grasses,
some livestock. This year it was seen
that February was the wrong time of
the year to exhibit livestock, but de­
spite this fact there were a large num­
ber of inquiries for stall space for the
Midwinter Fair. The secretary wrote
a number of the livestock men not to
bring their stock to the Fair but wait
until midsummer and altogether like­
ly a Livestock Show would be held to
accommodate them.
Therefore, at a recent meeting of
the Board of Directors of the Associa­
tion of Commerce it was unanimously
decided to have the first Livestock
Show the first week in July of this
year—1916.
The success of this first show will
largely determine whether there will
be annual shows. So all stock rais­
ers in this part of the state are urged
to take advantage of this opportunity
of showing their results in the stock
raising line. Every courtesy and ac­
commodation, within reason, will be
extended, and we believe that this
Stock Show will prove an eyeopener
to the most optimistic resident of this
great inland empire.
The Show will be held in the mam­
moth curling rink, adjacent to River­
side Park, where the farmers may
eat their dinners and view the results
of the efforts of the Minot Park Board
in providing a clean place of amuse­
ment for all the people who come to
Minot.
THE WARD COUNTY INDEPENDENT
THE INDEPENDENT HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION OF ANY WEEKLY PAPER IN THE STATE
Ball Games, Parades, Speeches, Fire­
works, Contests, Calithumpian
Parade, Band Concerts
It would take an entire page of the
Independent to describe in detail all
of the plans that the various commit­
tees have made for Minot's big Fourth
of July celebration.
Minot wants you to be her guest
during the day. Leave your pocket
books at home if you don't want to be
bothered with carrying them, for most
of the attractions will be free.
The program has been arranged so
that something will be going on near­
ly every minute during the day. In the
afternoon there will be a red-hot ball
game between the two best farmers'
teams. Aspirants for these honors
should confer with Ben Lesk, chair­
man of the sports and amusement com­
mittee, at once. Liberal purses will
be offered the teams. Last year the
north and south prairie crossed bats,
this contest being one of the best of
the day.
The Minot and Carrington teams
will play at the regular baseball park
in the evening. This will be one of the
Vol. 15: No. 9. Minot, Ward County, North Dakota, Thursday, June 15, 1916 Subscription $ 1 Per Annum
The main celebration will take place
in beautiful Riverside park. Minot has
more than a hundred acres of beautiful
wooded parks and these will be thrown
open to the public. Bring your lunches
and spread them under the leafy elms
on the well-kept lawns of our parks.
Committees have provided places for
your teams and autoes.
Minot has raised a fund of $2,000,
all of which will be spent in entertain­
ing you. There will be a big parade in
the morning, prizes to be given for the
best decorated autos. The Minot Met­
ropolitan band will give concerts thru
out the day. The program will take
place at the park. President A. G.
Crane and Hon. R. A. Nestos will' de­
liver addresses and there will be a
number of high class musical numbers.

best games of the season. Carrington
will play here July 3, 4 and 5. Admis­
sion will be charged for this game, but
no admission will be charged to the
game between the country teams,
which will be played at the new athlet­
ic grounds at Riverside park.
Of course there will be a purse hung
up for climbing the old-fashioned
greased pole. Old-fashioned boys will
contest for the honor and after a score
of them have scraped off the largest
part of the old-fashioned grease, the
wise lad who has been hanging back
will climb the pole and take the money.
Then there will be foot races, tug-of
war, boat and swimming races and
several contests for the ladies.
Early in the evening the Calithum­
pian parade will take place, prizes be­
ing awarded for the most grotesque
and original costumes. Following this
parade several blocks of Main street
will be roped off and hundreds will en­
joy a dancing carnival to music fur­
nished by a number of little German
bands.
All
forms
of grafting will be elim­
inated. The paries will be properly po­
liced. The committee will see that
autos charging but ten cents fare to
the parks will carry proper signs. The
parks are all within walking distance
of the business district and it will not
be necessary to ride unless one cares
to do so.
Committees are now busy putting
up advertising matter over the north­
western portion of the state. Several
advertising cars will go out next week.
Last year Minot entertained 20,000
people at our celebration and if the
weather permits, the crowd will be
even larger this year.
Many who come to the city that day
will be interested in the Zoo at River­
side park. The three elk secured from
the Yellowstone park last winter are
in splendid condition and the bear is
performing his very best. There are
several other interesting animals, in­
cluding coyotes, squirrels, etc.

precedents touch your rights as close­
ly as the statutes enacted by your leg­
islature. This court must construe
the statutes as well as pass upon prop­
erty rights. It is your court of last
resort it is no place for inexperience,
inefficiency, or untrained men. There
should be no experimenting by the
choosing of men of doubtful qualifica­
tions, or too old to do effectivt work,
as every member of this court must do
his full share of the work or retard its
progress and the discharge of its du­
ties toward you.
Every member is performing his full
share of labor and the court's work is
up to date, and every case that is now

ready has. been argued. All delays are
eliminated. In a few months from the
time an appeal is taken a final decis­
ion can be had here, instead of waiting
for years on account of accumulation
of undecided cases, as was the fact a
few years back. Within the last five
years this court has done as much
work measured by the volumes of its
reports as in the fifteen years immedi­
ately preceding. From 1889 to 1911,
when I took office, twenty volumes of
state reports held all the decisions of
this court. Our decisions since Janu­
ary, 1911, fill thirteen large volumes.
This increase is partly from the vast
increase in business, but principally
from the fact that the work has been
cleaned up. And decisions can be
speedily obtained and the court is do­
ing what it was constituted to do, be
an efficient arm of the government.
When I was your district judge I push­
ed that work. Have done the same
here.
All the present members are men in
their prime and able to work. The
three judges of this court seeking re­
election have all had district bench
experience, and are the only candidates
for nomination who have had it.
Because of experience, of results
achieved, as well as efficiency and sane
law in the light of business experi­
ence and practical common sense, my
progressiveness, administration of the
self and associates Judges Burke and
Fisk seek re-nomination and re-elec­
tion.
You may signify your approval of
candidacy at the primaries.

John Hairy, colored convict, one
time slave and friend of Abraham Lin­
coln, died at the penitentiary at Bis­
marck recently. Henry had passed his
hundredth birthday. The cause of his
death was old age. Following the close
of the Civil war. Henry moved to
Grand Forks where he was known a-=
an industrious, hard-working man. He
accumulated property and had a bank
account. Inflamed by liquor he came
home one day and in a quarrel killed
his wife. For this crime he was sen­
tenced to the penitentiary for life. His
money and his home went for attorney
fees. Henry has been a favorite of
various wardens and inmates of the
institution on account of his quaint
stories. Long after he had passed his
four score years and ten, he could and
did unload a car of coal a day. Usually
Henry would finish up by four o'clock
and nothing pleased the old man bet­
ter than to sit and watch the tender
feet who had been assigned to work
with him, struggling to finish unload­
ing a half car.
Medora ladies gave a dance and in­
vested the proceeds in gasoline street
lights for the city.

Minot Dodge Dealers Now Operate
Agencies at Williston, Plenty

F. N. Fuller, manager of the North­
west Motor company of this city, in
company with C. A. McKinney of Wil­
liston, returned from Grand Forks on
Wednesday where they purchased the
Grand Forks agency of the Dodge
Brothers' cars and will at once begin
the erection of a fine business block
at that point to house their offices and
salesroom, on a site purchased this
week. This firm will now have agen­
cies in this city, Williston, Grand
Forks and Plentywood, Mont., giving
them by far the largest selling agency
for the sale of Dodge Brothers' cars
west of the Mississippi. They have al­
ready contracted for 1,500 cars for de­
livery during the coming fiscal year
and this number will undoubtedly be
increased as conditions make addition­
al purchases necessary.
SETTLERS THREATEN TO
GET GOV. HANNA'S GOAT
(Special to Independent)
Van Hook, June 15.—Governor Han
na in his fight for U. S. senator will
lose a large number of votes around
Parshall and Van Hook and other
points on the Fort Berthold reserva­
tion, by reason of the strong prohibi­
tion work he did while a member of
congress. It appears to have been
discovered that the reason intoxicat­
ing liquor cannot be taken upon the
reservation, is that it was specifically
forbidden in the Act of Congress
which opened the reservation, which
states that no intoxicating liquor can
be taken upon the reservation without
permission of the United States gov­
ernment, which would require a spe­
cial act of congress—a thing not easi­
ly secured.
Governor Hanna while congressman
made a vigorous and successful fight
for this provision, which does not meet
the approval of the thirsty man, or the
man who wishes to make a little easy
money by the illegal sale of intoxi­
cants. As a consequence this vote is
being solicited away from the govern­
or and for other candidates. It begins
to look as if this wise provision was
the only real effective prohibition law
in the state, and made so by the ef­
forts of Mr. Hanna and which entrusts
to Uncle Sam the enforcement of
the same.

SUCCESSFUL YEAR
FOR NINOT AUTO CO.
Big Minot Concern Has Sold 2,200
Overland and Willis-Knight
Cars In Past Year
Mr. P. W. Miller, president, and Mr.
L. C. Stearns, secretary of the Minot
Auto Company, left today for Toledo,
O., to arrange for the closing of their
1917 contract with the Willys-Over­
land company.
The 1916 contract, which will close
July 1, has been an unusually success­
ful and satisfactory one. The Minot
Auto company have sold on their pres­
ent contract, in the neighborhood of
2,200 Overland and Willys-Knight au­
tomobiles. This is a record that
speaks for the progressive and enter­
prising spirit of the Minot Auto com­
pany and also proves that Minot is one
of the principal distributing centers of
the Northwest, as the Minot Auto com­
pany is the third largest distributor of
Overland and Willys-Knight cars in
the United States.
The Willys-Overland company have
conceded that the Minot Auto company
have the best dealers' organization
throughout the territory they are
handling, of any distributor of Over­
land cars in the entire United States.
They also have under their 1916 con­
tract, the largest territory in square
miles, of any distributor in the central
western states, with the exception of
the distributor on the Pacific coast.
Mr. Miller and Mr. Stearns consider
that the prospects for the 1917 season
are for even better business and a
larger number of sales than during the
season that is just ending.
