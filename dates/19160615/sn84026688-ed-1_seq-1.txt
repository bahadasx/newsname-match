SAVING FIRST ALFALFA CHOI’.
During recent years considerable
difficulty baa lieen had in certain lo
calities of the Southwest in saving the
first crop of alfalfa. Often heavy
rains come about the time the first
cutting should he made or soon after
the alfalfa is cut, thus making trouble
for the haymaker.
One solution to this difficulty prob
lem is to have a silo ready and incase
the weather is not favorable fur cur
ing hay put the first cutting into the
silo. Even after a heavy rain alfal
fa may be ensiled because consider
able moisture is required to pack the
silage so it will not mold.
Experiments were made on alfalfa
silage in California with good results.
Even alfalfa badly contaminated with
weeds were found to he worth saving
in the silo. Stock ate such alfalfa
when the weeds would render it al
most worthless when cured for hay.
The alfalfa grower cannot afford to
wait when his crop is ready to cut.
Regardless of the weather, he is often
forced to cut the first crop and take
chances on the weather rather than
run the risk of injuring the second
crop. If he has no silo ready he has
reduced the risk in saving the first or
even the second crop.

OVER THE WALL ||
By ALICE DURYEE.
A flowerpot rolled oft the top of
the wall at a point precisely above
that where David, In blue overalls,
was planting seeds, and as David was
In the act of stooping the pot bit him
on the head.
“The dickens!” he said, rubbing the
sore spot and looking around (or the
enemy. Whence hud the bombardment
come?
Just then a head appeared over the
top of the wall, or rather a pink sun
bonnet did, and the latter was vibrat
ing with excitement, not an emotion
of its own, but palpably that of the
wearer. “Oh, did my flowerpot hit
you? I’m dreadfully sorry, but 1
didn't know you were there.”
“It’s all right,” said David reassur
ingly, 'and I beg your pardon for
saying what I did. But 1 didn't dream
there was anyone around. The house
over there," nodding In her direction,
“has been quiet so long that you are
really more of a surprise than was
your method of announcing yourself.
Is Miss Wayland here, too?”
Marjorie started, and then remem
bering that she had on a blue morn
ing dress, big garden apron and sun
bonnet, decided that It was perfectly
natural for the Pearson’s gardener to
mistake her (or an underling. And
after all It suited her purpose ad
mirably. She was tired of the social
mill of a long winter and had retired
to this suburban retreat for a rest.
It had been many years since (he
family had moved to the city The
Pearsons had lived next door then.
The role the gardener gave her In
stantly suggested a plan
“No. Miss Wayland has—has gone
away!”
"I’m sorry? We hate to feci over
here that the big house is empty. It
used to be such a beautiful place."
His eyes. Intent upon the attractive
face in the depths of the rosy bonnet,
seemed to have a meaning that his
lips dare not utter.
“Oh, the house won’t be empty. I'm
going to stay. You see. Miss Wayland
Is—she and I—that Is, she Is very
kind to me, and she thought I needed
a change. So here I am doing Just
what I’ve longed to do for years, plant
ing flowers." She laughed. "And the
Joke of it Is I don't know anything at
all about them.”
“If you’ll let me, I’ll be very glad
to teach you,” answered the gardener
eagerly.
“Thank you. That will be nice and
I'd like it very much,’' smiled Mar
jorie. "Do the Pearsons still live —
1 mean —Miss Wayland spoke of a fam
ily next door —I think Pearson was
the name.”
“Yes, but the family is scattered.
Only two sons are at home now and
one of them Is away most of the time.
The other,' he hesitated, "the other
was away, too, for awhile, In the war
In Europe—the family Is Canadian,
you know —but he was wounded and
sent home He’s all right now though.
Improving In great shape.”
"That Is interesting,” Marjorie
cried. She was about to say, "I’d love
to meet him!” when she remembered.
“Walt! I’ll come round by the gate
and help you,” which rather aston
ished Marjorie, for the wall wasn't
more than breasthlgh and she felt
that she could have climbed It her
self.
“He improves on acquaintance," she
thought, ‘it’s hard to tell these days,
with colleges running courses on for
estry, farming and gardening, Just
who people are. A gentleman, that’s
pat!”
So the man came through the gar
den gate and lifted the pansies and
set them where they would grow and
mapped out beds for flowers whose
names she didn't even know.
Days passed and weeks! The gar
den flourished and grew.
Every day she had seen David and
they had worked together. "He looks
different somehow,” thought Marjorie,
watching him one day. “He soems
healthier and stronger than he did.
He never comes by the gate now."
As she spoke she broke the seal of
a letter that had come and glanced
rapidly over the contents. "So Aunt
Mary has to come and spoil It all!”
she exclaimed. “He’ll find out who
I am now! Oh, well! I don’t suppose
It matters much now! I’ve had a no
tion a half dozen times to tell him
everything anyway."
That night she dressed as Miss
Wayland. There was a moon and she
wandered through her garden to an
old stone bench near the wall. A man
vaulted lightly over Just then and
stopped when be saw her.
"Marjorie!”
“David! Won’t you come and sit
down?”
“I was on my way to your house.
But this Is better. I want to have a
talk and I’m not so much afraid of
you here.”
“Afraid!”
"Walt until you hear what 1 have
to say. 1 am David Pearson and have
masqueraded all summer as the gar
dener. 1 wouldn’t even tell you now
except that Dick, my older brother, is
coming home tomorow and the mur
der would out then anyway.
She was silent a moment. “Then,
since surprises are In order I am not
Miss Wayland’s companion either, I'm
Marjorie Wayland,” she confessed.
“I’ve known it all summer!’’ he
laughed confidently.

THE ORANGE
By LOUISE OLIVER.
Lucia stopped at Tony’s fruit stand
on her way homo and bought a dozen
oranges. It was ruining and besides
two other packages she had an um
brella to manage against a strong
wind.
Gradually the bag softened with the
dampness and clung like a plaster to
the round, yellow spheres within. A
tiny crack appeared, widened, length
ened, and the whole dozen oranges cat
apulted Into the street as though shot
out of a machine gun.
Mike Kubelik, carter for Sellem &
Hatch, was hauling a wagonload of
oranges from the Bay street market
to a West end brunch. Cro.) ing South
avenue, a rear wheel cauyht In a car
track and came off And hi.mediately
there was an avalanche of oranges in
all directions.
Now when Lucia’s bag broke, she,
too, was crossing South avenue, and,
moreover, it was at tho same instant
that Mike lost awh el. So she looked
down to see. not a dozen, b,,i hundreds
of dozens of oranges roll about her
feet.
Already halt a dozen urchins had
gathered around uml were filling
jacket pockets as fast as they could.
Mike, with fist, whip and many curs
ings, was doing the best ho could to
defend his treasure but It was futile.
Lucia, seeing no chance of reviving
her hag into a semblance of use, de
cided to use her umbrella as a recep
tacle and closed It. Then she stooped
and started deliberately to count a
dozen oranges Into its silk recesses.
"HI there!" Mike came up bellig
erently flourishing his weapon. "You
putta dem down."
Mike reached for the umbrella Just
as a man stepped between them and
put out a restraining hand.
“Let the lady alone,” he said quietly.
At the tone of authority Mike stepped
back without another word and his
whip fell.
“Go and attend to those boys and I’ll
get a policeman to help you.” the new
comer said, and to Lucia, ‘Have you
got nil your property? If so, 111 help
you out of this."
"I think I have. It wr.s hard count
ing with that man shaking his fist un
der my nose," she laughed. The or
anges are all here in my umbrella."
“Rut it's ruining hard. You’ll get
soaked."
"I’ve no other place to put them.”
"What's the matter with these deep
pockets in my coat?"
"But you mustn’t go home with mo.
1 live —oh, ever so far ”
“So much tho bettor There, and
there, and there and there! 1 guess
I’ve got them all," raising the um
brella.
At the door the oranges had to bo
transferred ‘Won't you come In?"
asked Lncla. "I’ll get a dish for
them.” So the man went in and they
emptied the fruit into a black-and
white china bowl.
“Thirteen!" he exclaimed “By love,
we’ve cheated the dago."
Tho man divided the odd orange
carefully in two parts and gave her
half
“In movies,” he remarked, “they tear
cards, or smash shells and each takes
a piece A sort of kismet, you know,
for each of the two contracting par
ties. Now why not nn orange skin.
See!"—fitting two pieces together.
“You take one and I’ll take tho other.
To keep as long ns wo live!” solemnly.
When her gallant defender had de
parted it suddenly occurred to Lucia
that she did not even know his name.
A week passed Busy days for Lu
cia, as all days were, but not too busy
for many thoughts of her recent ac
quaintance and his identity. Hut she
was to have a shock. One evening she
opened the paper, and there on tho
first page was the picture of the man!
Below it she read. "One of the sus
pects arrested in connection with the
Alison jewel case The man, who
gives his name as John Emerson, was
seen coming out of the alley In the
rear of the residence at 6:30 Thursday
evening and he could not explain his
presence there, although it was a doz
en blocks away from his lodgings and
place of business.”
Tuesday! That was the night ho
had taken her home! And 6:30 was
about the time he had left her. The
alley In question was between her
street and the Allisons’. He had prob
ably been taking a short cut home!
But why had he not told them his
errand 7
Lucia thought over all the details,
and the orange skin popped Into her
head. She would send it to him and
he would not refuse to see her, she
knew.
An hour later, among grim surround
ings, Luela was shown Into a little
white room, and John Emerson came
In a moment later.
‘Why didn’t you tell them where
you were last Tuesday?” was her
breathless greeting. “This is terrible.”
“I couldn’t without bringing your
name Into it and 1 thought I’d rather
be convicted than have your name
breathed here. You shouldn’t have
come—unless there is something I can
do for you.”
•There is! Tell them all about It.”
“I won’t.”
"Then 1 will!”
The district attorney heard tho
story. Mike was sent for and added
his share to the testimony. Then John
Emerson was allowed to depart
And that was only the beginning of
the end foi John and Lucia were mar
ried the other day.

NUMBERS DON’T COUNT
GREAT VICTORIES WON BY NU
MERICALLY INFERIOR ARMIES.
Most Notable Is the Conflict at the
Pass of Thermopylae—Small
Force of Irishmen Held the
Bridge at Athlone.
Tho victory of Gideon’s 300 over
120,000 Midianites, and the activities
of Samson with that Jawbone, as re
lated in the Book of Judges, are fair
indications that the Lord is not always
on the side of the big battalions,
writes George Irwin in New York Eve
ning Telegram. Profane history af
fords many instances of long odds.
Ten thousand Greeks routed 120,000
Persians at Marathon, and 300 brave
Spartans died while defending the
pass of Thermopylae against 1,500,000
(more or less) other brave Persians
during the famous invasion of Greece
by Xerxes.
The Scots have one to their credit
over England when In 1314 Robert
Bruce and 30,000 of his countrymen
routed 100,000 of their southern neigh
bors.
At Crecy In 1346 30,000 English
proved too many for 100,000 French,
and some years later at Poitiers the
Black Prince, with 12,000 men, dis
posed of the king of France and live
times that number principally by the
prowess of his archers.
Three hundred and fifty Irishmen
hold tho Shannon bridge at Athlone
against 18,000 English, Dutch and
Germans in 1691. Two hundred of
their number fell, but the bridge was
destroyed before the others drew off.
Charles XII of Sweden, with 9,000
men, defeated an army of 60,000 Rus
sians at Narva.
As might be expected in the wars
between civilization and barbarism or
semibarbarism. tho victory was gen
erally won by the former against fear
ful odds.
If the Spanish chroniclers are to be
believed Cortez defeated 200,000 A*-
tecs in the battle of Otuniba after he
evacuated Mexico City, or, us it was
then called, Tenochtitlan. On this oc
casion he could scarcely have mus
tered 200 Spaniards.
In India the British have had their
own share in this kind of warfare.
Robert Clive, with 3,000 men, defeated
Surajah Dowlah’s army of 50,000 at
Plassy in 1751, and Sir Robert Napier
tackled 30,000 Beloochees at Meanea
with 2,800 men.
The longest odds in any modern bat
tle were faced, however, by Garibaldi
when at the battle of Marsala in 1859,
with 1,000 "red shirts,” he attacked
and defeated 50,000 Austrians.
Tomato and Corn.
Have you heard of tho famous to
mato and corn clubs that are now or
ganized in many states of the coun
try? They originated in Aiken county.
South Carolina, in the brain of a little
schoolteacher named Marie Cromer,
who was getting thirty dollars a
month.
She asked her pupils one day, “What
are you doing to help maw?" They
all “allowed" that they were not "do
in’ nothin' much.” She started them
to doing something.
She got each of them to begin with
about the easiest cultivated plant, the
tomato, on a tenth of an acre of
ground, and the most efficient cultiva
tor was to receive a prize. All the to
mato clubs in the country started from
that.
Thousands of cans of tomatoes are
now produced from Aiken county
alone.
Then Jerry Moore got two thousand
boys of the state into corn clubs. And
there are now forty thousand through
out the South. These boys learn how
to produce corn at the lowest possi
ble cost.
Development of Tilefish Industry.
In its investigation of the possibili
ties of the tilefish industry, the United
States bureau of fisheries finds that
there is some reason to believe that
the fishing grounds extend some dis
tance toward Cape Hatteras, although
up to the present time they have
been developed only as far south as
about the latitude of Atlantic City.
In the extension of the field the zone
in which both the depth and temper
ature are suitable is probably much
narrower than farther north.
The commercial fishery for tilefish
continues to develop. During the
month of January 398,000 pounds were
landed at New York in 17 trips by six
fishing vessels, or an average of 23,400
pounds per trip. This is an increase
of 135 per cent over the amounts
landed during December. The price
remains uniform at an average of
about six cents per pound.—Scientific
American.
Many Druggist* and Physician*.
There is a drug store for every 2,-
000 inhabitants In the United States
and a physician for every 667 inhabi
tants, according to a directory census
of the drug trade Just completed by
the Pharmaceutical Era. The Bra
finds that there are 46,561 retail drug
gists located In 15,937 cities and
towns, and it also finds that there are
280 drug jobbing houses, including
12 that are owned by retail drug
gists on a co-operative plan. On the
basis of these figures there are 165 re
tail drug stores for every wholesale
drug house. The number of phy
sicians In the United States is esti
mated at 150,000, making an average
of one drug store for every three phy
sicians-
EL FASO NAMED IN 1598
Border City Was So Called by Juan
do Onate, an Explorer of the
Early Days.
As you near El Paso you catch a
glimpse, at Ysleta. of the venerable
church, now hopelessly "restored,”
that was built away back In 1682 after
the Pueblo uprising. Does this sound
like a remote date In American his
tory? One Is constantly surprised
down here by the antiquity of the set
tlements, Ernest Pelxotto writes In
Scribner's.
El Paso is certainly no exception to
the rule, for it was given its name In
1598 by Juan de Onate, one of the
earliest explorers of New Mexico, who,
having forded the Rio Grande at this
point, called it El Faso del Norte —the
Pass to the North. Fifty years later
the old church and mission at Juarez
were built. But from that time until
the Mexican war period the site 01 El
Paso itself remained a ranch belong
ing to the Ponce de Leon family. Aft
er the American occupation it became
a terminal point on the old Overland
trail from St. Louis to San Francisco,
and the rumbling stage coaches
brought life and glitter to the saloons
and gambling joints of the Calle El
Paso.
The last half century has again vast
ly changed all this, and the border
town has been completely submerged
In the steady march of modern im
provement.
Pioneer plaza remains the center of
the city’s activities, to be sure, but
upon it, instead of humble adobe homes
and tawdry shops, front two great ho
tels. several large department stores
which display the very latest fashions
and the “largest all concrete building
In the world.”
IN LIFE’S TRAINING SCHOOL
Preparation for War and Peace As
suredly a Part of the Preparation
for Industrialism.
It has long been evident, though the
fact has not yet made Its due Im
pression, that industrialism is the mod
ern training school for war or peace.
It is there that men are actually think
ing of one another in terms of war or
peace. It Is there that they learn to
organize for or against one another.
Ijfie lockout and the strike are dis
tinctly warlike measures. Arbitration
is a term ol war, the most advanced
term looking toward peace, but still
presupposing a state of warfare. Co
operation, In some one of Its manifold
forms, is the only distinctive term of
peace. It is such, not simply because
it implies sympathetic action, but be
cause it educates all concerned in
"those sobrieties on which democracy
must at last rest.” Ae we recall how
many persons are In the training
school of industrialism, how eariy they
enter it and how long they remain in
it, and how various and how Influen
tial are the experiences through which
they pass, we can see how far back
the peace movement must reach in Its
educative work. What can we hope
to accomplish In the training of our
diplomats for carrying out the policy
of universal peace. If we cannot train
our captains of industry, in the ranks
both of capital and of labor, to think
and to act In the terms of pence?—
William J. Tucker, In the Atlantic.
Woman's Love.
It takes a hundred men to make an
encampment, but It takes only the In
fluence of one woman to moke a
home. I not only admire woman as
the most beautiful object ever cre
ated, but I reverence her as the re
deemed glory of humanity, the sanc
tuary of all virtues, the pledge of all
perfect qualities of heart and head.
It Is because women are so much bet
ter than men that their faults are
considered greater. The one thing In
this world that is considered constant,
the only peak that rises above the
clouds, the window In which the light
burns forever, the one star that dark
ness cannot quench, Is woman’s love.
It rises to the greatest height, it sinks
to the lowest depth, It forgives the
most cruel Injustice. A woman’s love
Is the perfume of the heart. This Is
the real love that subdues the earth,
the love that has wrought miraclas of
art, that gives us music all the way
from cradle song to the grand sym
phony that bears the soul away on
wings of Are. A love that is greater
than Are, sweeter than life and
stronger than death. —Robert G. In
gersoll.
Ventilate the Bedroom,
If beds received more attention
there would be lose of that ‘tired
feeling” In the morning. The bed
ought to be the most hygienic piece
of furniture in the house. It should
be well aired and never dressed Im
mediately after the occupant leaves
it. And when it is being aired the
windows should bo wide open.
Regardless of the condition of your
couch, however. If you sleep in a
stuffy room you are bound to pay the
penalty. When you open the win
dows wide and sleep In a hygienic
and properly equipped bed you can
depend upon nature to d<# her pai t in
assisting you to recuperate and gain
strength. The time to begin prepara
tion for a good night’s rest is when
you leave your bed in the morning,

THE RASPBERRY |
By OLIVE KENNSET. |
' •################################)
When Blair Tuttle's sister Maud
came home from finishing school she
unquestionably had been thoroughly
“finished.”
Maud had always been content to
wear hats that came from Mrs Crln
dle’s, but since she had brought home
two hats from Madam Rose’s in New
York she hadn’t any use for Crindie
style.
"isn’t that the most impossible hat
you ever saw,” she said one day when
she was passing Mrs. Crlndle's with
that big, good-hearted brother of hers,
who was now in the graduating class
at Truxdale, captain of the football
team and one of the most popular men.
“It looks just like a raspberry sun
dae and it is quite as insipid and ab
surd.”
Blair was more attentive to Maud’s
little tirade than she had expected.
“You ought to know, I suppose,"
agreed Blair. “Now, I’ll tell you why
I am interested. You know our senior
play. Of course, no one is supposed
to know what it is about, but I have
got to get your help. For some rea
son, I am in charge of the costumes.
1 have got to see that the fellows get
the right sort of thing to wear for
their parts. Now, one of the charac
ters is a young gawk of a country
girl, and her part calls for just the
kind of thing that you seem to think
that raspberry-sundae hat stands for.
I was thinking maybe I'd get you to
trim up something fur me, but 1 guess
you couldn’t do any better than that
hat.”
“Oh, Blair, it would be the hit of the
show.”
Maud agreed to buy the hat for her
brother.
Caste lines were but loosely drawn
in Truxdale. The minister’s daughter
had felt no hesitancy in marrying the
son of the grocer on the corner, the
young doctor felt It an honor to know
the daughter of old Dobbs, who drove
the station wagon.
So Clarice Miggins came in for her
share of the college fun —little bright
eyed, slender Clarice, who had been
known to every sweet-toothed boy in
college as the dispenser of his favorite
brand of soda water or sundae.
But Clarice had cherished ambition.
There was not enough scope for her
imagination in the task of soda dispen
ser. So when an apprentice was need
ed at Criudle’s millinery shop she left
the fountain on a day’s notice. Blair
Tuttle could but feel a satisfaction In
knowing that hereafter those bright
eyes of hers would shine only for
haughty Mrs. Crindie and her other as
sistants or the occasional woman shop
pers who came in to try on the new
millinery.
“I am so perfectly happy tonight,"
Clarice told Blair when he called at
her boarding house to take her to the
movies, that single source of evening
diversion in Truxdale. “The most won
derful thing has happened. My bal
my very own hat —that 1 worked on
so hard has been sold. I didn't see
the young lady that bought it, but the
girl who waited on her said she looked
like a fashion plate, with a hat that
must have come from New York. Isn’t
that wonderful?”
Blair had more than once before
tried to get his courage up to tell the
high-spirited little girl that she was
part of his own plana for happiness
and that in the career he was about to
start after his graduation from col
lege he needed her encouragement
more than anything.
“But, Clarice, I don’t want you to be
Independent. I don’t want you to gc
on this way.”
Clarice was too full of the enthu
siasm of achievement to be stilled.
“I do wish you had seen it before
it was sold, that hat of mine. The
silk was Just the color of the rasp
berry sirup we used at the fountain."
Suddenly Blair realized that this
masterpiece of Clarice's was none
other than the property hat he had at
present stowe’d away in his own room.
What Maud had said to him about it
came back with vividness. What it
Clarice knew? What if she ever found
out that this hat on which she had
spent so much thought and care, and
on which she had banked such hopes
of future success, was bought only
because it was a caricature? Blair
tried to think of a scheme whereby
her feelings might bo saved.
“Do you know, Clarice, my own sis
ter, the one who has been away to
boarding school, bought that hat. Bho
noticed it the first thing. 1 must get
you two girls to meet each other
some time. I know you will be great
friends. I believe Maud Is going away
visiting this summer sometimes, and
she wanted that raspberry hat to go
with one of her new dresses. You
ought to have heard what she said
about it! I guess it is most too pretty
to wear around hero in Truxdale. But
Clarice, you don’t want to go on with
that millinery business idea of yours.
You know what I am driving at. Two
or three of the seniors are going to be
married right after college closes.
Commencement is next week, and
then the senior play will come the
next night. I have got to stay around
for that—l’m the costumer and there
is quite a bit to do —but, tell mo,
Clarice, will you marry me the very
next day. And then when I start out
on that new Job of mine I won’t have
to go alone.”
Her acceptance of his proposition
helped Blair very materially out of the
raspberry-sundae hat difficulty.
