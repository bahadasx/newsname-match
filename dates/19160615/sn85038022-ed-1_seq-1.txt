onstratlon.
For somo tlmo j8Bt thero has been
qulto a bit of talk concerning a "pre
paredness" parado to be hold In this
city on July 4. Tho Chamber of Com
merce took cognisance of tho fact and
aftor a consultation between Secretary
Doono and Mr. James Hall, Chairman
ot tho Special Events Committee It
was decided "to havo tho parado on La
bor Day Instead of July 4.
Tho change was mado becauso of
the fact that on Independence Day
thero will bo two bnll games here,
Chautauqua will bo going on and the
brick streets will bo torn up.
If tho parade were held on the
Fourth, It would havo to bo confined
to tho down town section. On Labor
Day It can extend over tho whole town
as tho now streets will then bo com
pleted, and tho parado can bo mado
Into a colobrntlon over tho fact that
Maysvlllo Is tho possessor of somo of
tho best streets that can bo had. The
local unions and fraternal orders will
bo aBkcd to partlclpato in tho parado.
