Colleges Should Teach the Youth That
He Belongs to His Country
By Present CHARLES ALEXANDER RICHMOND of
Union College
Tli'E colleges can serve the country in better ways than by giving the
time and energy of their young men to military training. Every
year of general college training adds value to the man, and this
value should be conserved to the country.
What we need more than anything else is a preliminary training in
patriotism winch shall establish the principle in the heart of evcrv young
man that he belongs to his country and that THE COUNTBI HAS
THE RIGHT To LAY ITS HAND UPON HIM AND CLAIM
HIM FOR SERVICE.
A universal system which would assert this principle from time to
time would fee of immeasurable value. As between the individual for
the state and the state for the individual we have chosen the latter policy
and chosen wisely. But there are millions in America whose idea of lib
erty is one of privilege and not one of obligation. There must be some
true middle ground between the two theories of the state.
CERTAINLY WE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO STRIKE A RIGHT BAL
ANCE BETWEEN THE FAIR DEMANDS OF THE STATE AND THE DE-
MjMW OF TMF IHiniUIDIIAI ■
