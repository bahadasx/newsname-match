Board Co., and of the Rli er Raise i
Paper Co., and known as one of the
best and most successful paper mill
operators in the United States. Mr.
Wood will also have charge of the
construction and erecting of the
plant.
It was thought that the plant
miht be delayed on account of the
Ktarcity of machinery, but the Great
'Southern Lumber Company went
into the market and paid fancy
pices for their machinery, and as a
result, it will be ready on schedule
time.
The building will be of brick, with
creosoted yellow pine roof and the
mill and out buildings will occupy
several acres and the capacity will
be100 tons per day. When the
mill is in operation, counting the
men who will be working in the
woods, it will give employment to
500 men.
Bogalusa will profit greatly at
ace by the announcement for
while the mill is being built, it will
fives scores of workmen employ
ant, and some estimate that from
the time work starts until the mill
i in operation the payrole will
halmost as large as when the
mill is running.
Arrangements are being made to
Ahve the first dirt on the site thrown
t July 4th and to have a ceremo
" that will be in keeping with the
Weat. The building of the new
ailmeans that the population of
i*ilusa will increase 1.500 at the
lest estimate, within the next

F. L. Sanford, President of the
Police Jury. Robt. Cowan, Supt. of
the Sanford Mill at Zona, Jesse
Johnso,:, the well known young at
torney and Clyde S. Moss made a
trip of 200 miles in Mr. Sanford's
Buick car last Sunday, visiting Pop
larville, Lumberton, Purvis, Hatties
burg, Columbia and other nearby
cities. The Mississippi sandbeds
that have caused motorists so much
trouble, were of no concern to the
Buick which went through the
sands at a rapid rate. On several
occasions the car ran at a rate of
25 miles an hour on its "reputation"
-the power being cut off. On hill
climbing, it went over the famous
Mississippi hills at a rate of speed
in excess to 25 miles per ,hour.
Over 200 miles were covered in the
12 hours without even a puncture.
The trio convinced the party there
are many worse roads in some sec
tions of Mississippi than in Washing
ton parish.

Bogalusa spent a delightful Sunday
in Mississippi on the bank of Pearl

served by the girls. Afterwards a
gasoline launch was secured all en
joyed a trip up the river, returning
late.

-t

St. Louis, June 13.-President
Wilson has always considered "13"
his lucky number and today the
Democratic National convention
met to nominate a candidate for
president and vice president and
every indication noints to the fact
that the convention will be a big
love feast as far as the nomination
of a President is concerned. There
may be a some opposition to the
nomination of Tom Marshall as vice

Mr. and Mrs. V. E. Custer and
daughters Misses Blanche and Mar
jorie of Waco, Texas are in Boga
lusa as the guests of Mr. and Mrs.

visited here on several occasions
and is well known to a large num
ber of Bogalasa ladies.
Buys Third Ford
W. G. Dorsey purchased a new
Ford car last week. This is the
third Ford he has owned, and the
fact that he prefers it to any other
car, for Bogalusa is being used as a
great sales argument by the local
agency.

church will give an ice cream social
in the Goodyear Park Friday even
ing June 23.
t president but indications are that
" he will also be nominated again.

temporary chairman and delivered
the keynote speech. Itjs expected I
that the routine business will be v

e the convention regardless of the
e fact that no fight is expected. t
Check Raiser Captured
1 Calvin Jones, colored, raised a
Great Southern check from $3.61 t
to 30.61 and when the officers start
ed to arrest him he showed some
e speed record. Shots were fired at
1 him but made him go all the faster
s so Officer Harrell decided to demon
s strate that he was a good sprinter
e and after a few minutes race the
a negro was captured. He will be
tried in the district court.
v Mrs. Magee Much Improved
The friends of Mrs. Joe Magee,
wife of the former sheriff, will be
glad to learn that she has entirely
recovered from a recent operation
which she underwent at the Touro
Infirmery. The operation which
was performed by Dr. H. C. Cole
t formerly connected with the Boga
e lusa Hospital, was a complete suc
cess.
e No Match For Local Team
I The Penick and Ford Velva's of
t New Orleans were no match for the
locals, and the visitors were unable
I to get one run in the game Sunday
- while the locals made the circuit
six times. The inability of the
visitors to hit and the perfect work
1 of the locals, made it a very one
s sided affair. This is the second
s game of the year that the Velvas
have lost.
Free Pictures At Park
Starting Friday evening June 23, ;
v pictures will be shown at Goodyear
e park every other Friday evening. j
e They will he instructive as well as

BOGALUSA TO HAVE GREATEST
CELEBRATION IN CITY'S HISTORY
Enough Amusements To Keep Everybody Busy From
Early Morning Until Late At Night. Fireworks
To Be A Gorgeous Affair
HUGHES AND FAIRBANKS J
ARE REPUBLICANS CHOICEll
Neiminated For President t
And Vice President At f
('hicago ('onvelntion
1
Chica.{o. June 1.).-Soleni:; atd " :
with an air of re :ia.ti3on the Re
publican national C ,CveC tion fmi-
lated Supreme Court Jsntice Char- s
les E. Hughes for president and' a
Charles Warren Fairbanks of
Indiana, for vice-president thisie
afterpoon. Hughes receivedl 949 1-2 ir
votes out of the 985 in the conven- f
tion on the first ballot of the day c
and the third of the session; Roose
velt, who was at the same time t
being riotously nominated at the E
Progressive convention, got 18 1-2 t
votes in the Republican body.
The tide that set in for Hughes
was "such a tide as moving seems
asleep." It was strong, but silent.
It swept away all but four of the 1
minor candidates, those being i
Lodge, with seven votes, Dupont
with five, Weeks with three and La E
Follette with three. t
Root, Cummins, Burton and Fair- I
banks all formidable contenders at I
the outset, faded into oblivion in
the final voting.
The settled determination of the
delegates to name Hughes today
and get the business done was only
strengthened by a final appeal from I
Roosevelt, submitted in a note from
the Progressive convention.
The colonel, as a last peace offer
ing, suggested the name of Senator
Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachus- 1
etts. North Carolina, alone, of all
the 48 states and three territories
r took the offer seriously. That state
gave Lodge seven votes of its 14.
Probably never in the history of
party government has the naming
of a candidate-been so perfunctory
as was the nomination of Mr
Justice Hughes.
