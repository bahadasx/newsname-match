This is the last two weeks of the
contest and right now there is the
prettiest race imaginable, and we
cannot venture a prediction as to
which of the candidates will win the
title of "most popular lady in Williamsburg
and adjoining counties"
and the Maxwell car.
If you are a wide-awake person

an opportunity when you see it, you
will no longer hesitate to throw
yourself into the race with spirit
and determination. It is up to the
workers now to show what they are
made of. At the present writing
there is so little difference in the
standing so far a9 the votes are concerned
that a little extra effort on
the part of some of the candidates
will put them into the lead far
enough so they will have nothing
to fear on the last evening of the
contest.

* There is no use getting discouraged
in the race.it will only help you
.r-^loac out entirely. "People always
discouraged and despondent do not
succeed in anything and live only by
burdening someone else. The hope'
ful, confident and cheerful attract
the elements of success."
The optimist remembers yesterday's
sunshine while you frown at
the storms today. While, others 1

& wreckage of disaster he picks the
timbers that will do for the rebuilding.
He is a soldier of the foreguard,
marching on to open and
make safe the new ways. Failure he
never knows, because ambition's
golden sun is always shining in his
face. He is touched with the blazing
God-spark of achievement?filled
with the mightiest message given to
man. So in this contest?the optimist
never is rebuffed on account of
failure. She figures that failures
are but the pillars of success, and
she picks up the lesson to be learned
and marches straight to VICTORY.

HUGHES NAMED BY RE- r
PUBLICAN CONVENTION!
n
ROOSEVELT NOMINATED BY PRO- K
GRESSIVES BUT DECLINES AC- "
CEPTANCE AT THIS TIME.
Chicago, June 10:?Charles Evans *
Hughes was nominated today for 0*
President by the Republican National
convention, receiving 9-19$ votes a
#/-,! M T-V tl U
io 182 ror Kooseven.
Theodore Roosevelt was nominato
?d by the Progressive convention, ^
but in a telegram received just be- tl
fore 6 o'clock this afternoon he ad- lc
ci9ed his party that he "cannot ac:ept
at this time."
a
Intense bitterness and factional j{
jtrife that augurs well for the candidates
to be nominated by the t<
Democratic party at St Louis next
tveek marked the ending of the con- t|
ventions. There is no doubt in the t)
mind of any politician that the Dem- b
jcratic candidate will be Woodrow a
Wilson. p
Of overshadowing importance was ^
the last five minutes of the session j,
!>f the Progressive convention, the t<
adroit handling of which prevented r
an outbreak that might have result- 91
r
?d in the repudiation of Col Roose- f
velt himself and not improbably the ti
complete demoralization of the party a
organized by him four year? ago. n
This perilous situation was caused 9
by the personal act of Col Roosevelt
in withholding his acceptance of the k
nomination of President tendered t:
him by the Progressive party at P
thirty minutes after noon today, ?
one-half minute in advance of the f
nomination of Supreme Court Jus- o
tice Hughes by the Republican contention.
*
The Republican ticket was com- *
pleted by the nomination of former
Vice President Charles W Fairbanks
to be the running mate of Mr
Hughes, both of whom have accepted
the honor conferred upon them
Bvith unanimity, but without the enthusiastic
approval that ordinarily
characterizes the designation of a
Presidential ticket in a political contention.
I
The Progressive ticket is only half
complete. The nomination for Vice
President was given to and accepted
by John M Parker, a sugar producer
sf Louisiana and an ardent support
?r of Col Roosevelt. The Presidential
nomination was placed in escrow
at the request of Col Roosevelt himself.
Until he finally decides whether
to accept or decline, it will remain
in ,the possession of the Progressive*
National committee, which
was empowered to fill vacancies by
one of the last acts of the convention.
despite the storm of protest
made against this procedure even
before the full significance of it had i
been revealed.
Some of the leaders of the Pro- j
gressive party Kvho had been advis-!
ed in advance of the purpose of Col
Roosevelt to withhold his acceptance
succeeded in resisting the impulse
'hat moved them to denounce the
action of the leaders upon whom
they had conferred the highest
honors in their power.
Justice Charles E Hughes this afternoon
sent this telegram from
Washington to Chairman Hardin?)
[>f the Republican National conven-'
tion in Chicago:
Mr Chairman and Delegates:
I have not desired the nomination, j
[ have wished to remain on the bench.!
But in this critical period of our i
national history I recognize that it!
is your right to summon and that it.
is my paramount duty to respond.'
5fou speak at a time of national exi- j
?ency transcending mereiy partisan
consideration.
You voice the demand for a domilant,
thorouprhsroinj? Americaaism,
tfith firm protective upbuilding polices
essential to our peace and security,
and to that call, in this crisis,
[ cannot fail to answer with the
pledge of all that is in me to the -
?rvice of our country. Therefore, ti
accept the nomination. s<
I stand for the firm and unfiinch- is
iff maintenance of all the riffhts of 9,
Ltnerican citizens on land and sea. a<
I neither impuffn nor underesti- p
late difficulties. But it is most re- d
rettably true that in our foreign ci
elations we have suffered incal- c<
ulably from the weak and vacillat- r<
iff course which has been taken is
nth regard to Mexico, a course la- e<
lentably wrong with regard to both ai
ur rights and our duties. ai
We interfered without consistency; si
nd, while seeking to dictate when ti
re were not concerned, we utterly I3
ailed to appreciate and discharge f<
ur plain duty to our own citizens, ei
Lt the outset of the Administration ei
lie high responsibilities of our dip- 0
imatic intercourse with foreign nalons
were subordinated to a con- g
eption of partisan requirements, p
nd presented to the world a humil- nr
tting spectacle of ineptitude. ai
Belated reports have not availed ir
3 recognize the influence and pres- ti
ige so unfortunately sacrificed; and
rave words have been stripped of a:
heir force by indecision. I desire r<
3 see our diplomacy restored to its
est standards, and to have these
dvanced; to have no sacrifices of
stional interests to partisan exediency;
to have the first ability of
he country always at its command, A
ere and abroad, in diplomatic in- g
;rcourse; to maintain firmly our k
ights under international law, in- r<
isting steadfastly upon all our fi|
ights as neutrals, and fully perorming
our international obligaions;
and by the clear correctness Cl
nd justice of our position and our b
lanifest ability and disposition to 0
stain them, to dignify our place tj
mong the nations.
I t>tand for an Americanism which p
nows no ulterior purpose; for a pa- 11
rctism which is single and com- ti
lete. Whether native or naturaliz- q
d, or whatever race or creed, we a
ave but one country,and we do not
or an instant tolerate any division
f allegiance. 0
We must have the strength which p
?lf-respect demands,the strength of f
n efficient nation ready for every
mergency. (
Our preparation must be indus??
