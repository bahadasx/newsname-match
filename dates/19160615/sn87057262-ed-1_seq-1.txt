ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.—"Speed
up" methods were applied by demo
cratic leaders today in the convention
plans. When the convention mat at
11 o'clock today it was with the
fairly general understanding that
efforts would be made to adjourn thf
conclave sine die not later than Fri
day evening, instead of Saturday, as
at first planned. The session begin
ning at 11 o'clock was to be devoted
entirely to oratory with Permanent
Chairman Ollie James as the second
ary "key-noter," the main spellbinder.
Then, if the leaders' plans carried,
the convention was to adjourn unti!
tonight, when the resolutions com
mittee was expected to submit the
platform and the convention to ratify
this declaration of principles. To
morrow bright and early the demo
crats were to begin nominating.
The speeding up process was ap
plied because of waning interest in
the proceedings exhibited by the dele
gates and audience. Seveial hundred
persons who came to see the conven
tion, left today.
Not even the enthusiasm disguised
the fact that the convention is en
tirely dominated by Woodrow W,

and it doesn't do a thing that has
not been mapped out by the presi
dent. He picked the key-noter, sub

ST. LOUIS, Mo., June 15.—Certain
hyphenated organizations in the
United States charged with attempt
ing to influence the course of this
government in its foreign relations,
will be vigorously denounced in the
platform to be adopted by the demo
cratic convention. President Wilson's
ideas on International relations, Mexi
co, suffrage and other issues will
dominate the platform. It was learn
ed today, however, that the tentative
draft which was sent to St. Louis by
Secretary of War Baker* touches tho
high spots, leaving numerous minor
Issues to be worked out by the reso
lutions committee.
Denunciation of organizations en
deavoring to influence this govern
ment's policy will come in the Ameri
canism plank. Not only will the or
ganizations themselves be denounced,
but any party seeking political ad
vantages thrpugh such organizations
will be included in the scoring.
Woman's suffrage will be endorsed.
In addition to the Americanism
plan, the United Press learned today
that the president's suggestions ara
substantially as follows:
National Preparedness.
A firm demand for a navy that will
be sufficient to protect American in

and an army sufficient to protect our
