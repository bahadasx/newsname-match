ONCE MORE FORBES ADVISES DEPRECIATION FUND.
That the Honolulu Gas Company; Limited, should set aside a cash depre
ciation fund for its entire plant was urged upon that company at a meeting

Forbes insists that such a move would be of advantage to the company

repairs as they came instead of setting aside a specific fund each year for
depreciation. .

Uncle Sam's Foremost Author
ity Here on Mission of Mill- -r
tary importance .
A. S. Hitchcock, Uncle Sam's fore
most authority npon grasses, has come
to Honolulu on a mission which may
not only be of Immense military im
portance but may be a decided boon to
the dairy industry of the islands He
arrived on the transport Tuesday.
He doesn't look like a noted man.
He might be selling grass seed in a
country feed store and not appear out
of place.
-7 But A. S. Hitchcock is the world
authority on grass. He knows more
about it than any living man, except
possibly Prof. E. Haeckel of Germany.
But Prof. Haeckel has not done any
active work fpr several years and has
never been interested in the econo
mic study of grasses, only in the scien
tific study: .
Prof. Hitchcock not only knows
most of the grasses of the world by
their first names but he knows what
their uses are, and whether they
may be successfully cultivated and
how many tons will grow to the acre
and how; muck it will cost a ton to
rajse. '
He arrived with his son, A. E. Hitch
cock, and will stay until October study
ing the grasses of the islands and col
lecting specimens for his collection in
Washington the largest collection oi
grasses in the world. Hawaii is the
onjv part of the United States not
represented there. Prof. Hitchcock
has spent months in Alaska, Porto
Rico,, Mexico, Central America, .the
Canal Zone, Cuba and other islands
of the West Indies collecting. He has
an assistant in the Philippines who
has sent him all the grasses there.
Now he is going to scour Hawaii for
new specimens.
"I don't expect that I will find many
native grasses common to the islands
and mainland " he declares yesterday.
"Of course, there are a great number
rA introduced grasses here, but the
native specimens will probably be new
to me." -
He is to duplicate his collection of
native specimens for the local federal
agricultural experiment station. Cases
have been ordered and as soon as he
legins to collect classify and arrange
