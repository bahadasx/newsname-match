Chicago.?Charles E. Hughes and 1
Theodore Hoosevelt, both of New
York, were nominated for President I
?y ine Republican and Progressive
conventions at 12:4H and 12:47 o'clock
Saturday, respectively, the Roosevelt
nomination beating the Hughes nomination
by exactly two minutes.
Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana
was nominated for Vice President on
the Republican ticket and John M.
Parker of Louisiana on the Progres- '
slve. The Hughes nomination was
made on the third ballot of the contention,
the Roosevelt nomination by 1
acclamation.
Colonel Roosevelt sent a tentative ]
declination of the nomination, with ,
i the understanding that it was to stand (
if Hughes turned out to be sound on
the issues of Americanism and pre- ,
t puredness, and that if Hughes turned |
out to be pactitlstic, pussy-footed, or (
, pro-German he would accept and
make the race as the Progressive candidate.
' Justice Hughes broke all records by j

mlttee, and declared his position not j

t Leaders Seen Satisfied.
At 2:01 p. tn. the convention ad
w journea. mere were expressions or
b ' harmony from all the leaders and
I among the delegatos. The delegations
which on the final ballot had cast
i votes for others than Mr. Hughes
made statements declaring their loy- j
1 t alty to the nominees. ,
"Six months ago," said Chairman ; i
* i "Hilles of the National Committee, "I | <

said n nominee would be born in the
convention, and he was."
"I am very much pleased, of course,"
said Mr. Hitchcock. "It means a reunited
Republican party and victory
in November."
The nomination of Mr. Hughes was
made possible so soon by an overnight
break up of the allied favorite
sons' combination which early in the
morning released its delegates, practically
all of whom were known to
favor Mr. Hughes when freed from
wuwtt lilOll UVHVJ13.
Favorite Sons Withdrew
When the convention began business
shortly before noon the withdrawal
of the favorite sons was an
nounced one after another and the
votes began hopping into the Hughes
column in solid blocks so rapidly that
the nomination plainly was assured
ueiore the roll call had gone live
3tates. When it got to Colorado the
drift was so apparent that a proposal
to make it unanimous was made, but
Chairman Harding ruled that the balloting
should take its regular course.
Greeted By Yells.
Each addition to the Hughes columu
was greeted by yells of exultation
from the rapidly accumulating
Hughes delegates and steadily state by
state the votes piled up until New
Jersey carried it past the required
45?4 and the remainder was only a
formality.
In rapid succession as the vote went

Then one after the other. Senator
Weeks ana Senator Lodge took the
platform pledged loyalty to the nominee
and asked all their supporters |
to do likewise, Similar announce- j
nients were made from all the favor- i
Its sons delegation.
As the roll call proceeded whole
blocks of votes piled in for Fairbanks
and his nomination was such a fore 1
gone conclusion that the delegates be- (
gan leaving and caused such confusion
that the balloting was heard with I
JiiTiculty.
Burton Goes to Fairbanks.
With the end of the balloting for
the presidential nomination and the
official announcement the balloting
for Vicb President began. There were
some surprise when Governor Willis
of Ohio withdrew Burton's name and
cast the whole block of Ohio votes for
Fairbanks.
Alter Chairman llnrding had officially
announced the nomination of
Fairbanks, the usual resolutions were
passed. Chairman Hilles called a
meeting of the new National committee
for organization, and the couven
tion adjourned.
Notable Convention.
The convention was notable in political
history for many things. A
man had steadfastly refused to
seek tin nomination had been chosen;
it was the first Republican convention
since 1888 which had been forced to
lake more than one ballot to agree
upon a candidate, and it had been
marked by a lack of riotous demonstration
and nervous enthusiasm
which hitherto had been a feature
[)f such gatherings. It did not touch
any of the existing records for sustained
demonstrations, but despite
the fact that it was wholly and decidsdly
"unbossed;" it moved with a precision
and quietness which had not
been equalled since the McKinley convention
in Philadelphia.

TKE WEEK'S EVENTS
Important Nrws of the State, Nation,
and World Told in a Few Lines
for Your Convenience.
ROUND ABOUT IKE WORLD
A Condensed Record of Happenings
of Interest From All Points
of the World.
Mexican News
A dispatch from Laredo, Texas, says
fifteen Mexican bandits attacked four
employees on the T. A. Coleman ranch
at San Samuel, forty miles northwest
of Laredo, drove the ranchmen from
the corral and escaped across the Rio
G.ando with 83 horses. A company
of uDucu States cavalry is cn the
scene.
Anti-American demonstrations in
northern Mexico continue, according
to official advices, particularly in the
states of Chihuahua, San Luis Potois
and Nuevo Leon.
Americans are leaving Mexico in
steadily increasing numbers. Under
the previous instructions, state department
agents in Mexico are giving
every possible nid. In addition border
agents have been instructed to urge
those seeking to rcturu to Mexico to
stay on the American side.
The spread of the anti-American
agitation in Mexico may delay the
sending of a reply to General Car
ranza's note demanding recall of the
American troops. Creation, of an international
commission to discuss all
difficulties is known to have been
suggested, under existing treaties, and
it is understood the proposal is still
before President Wilson.
At El Paso, Texas, United Slates
customs officials are warning Americans
that owing to conditions in
Mexico, it i& inexepdient to attempt
to visit the interior of that country.
DOMESTIC
An anti-American riot, incited by a
mass meeting to protest against the
continued presence of American troops
in Mexican territory, was put down in
Chihuahua City by the military after
a demonstration had been made
against the American consulate and
stones hurled at the Foreign club in
the belief that It was an American
institution.
A proposal to General Carranza that
the United States and the Mexican de
facto government submit the whole
subject of their relations to an international
commission is being seriously
considered by the United States. Such
o nrr?r\<\oo1 If ? 1 ' ? .1 ~ ?5,1

a reply to the Mexican note demanding
withdrawal of the American troops,
and may contemplate adjustment of
many unsettled differences that for
yenrs have caused accumulating embarrassment
in the relation of the two
countries.
European War
From the wooded region of southwest
Russia to the Roumanian frontier
the Russians are keeping up their
tremendous offensive against the Austro-Hungarians
who have been reinforced
on several sectors by Germans.
The advance of the Russians is notable
for the large number of prisoners
taken, and the enormous captures
of guns, machine guns, ammunition
and other war stores.
The Russians now have retaken
Dubno, the second of the fortresses
in the Volhynian triangle, and are
pressing the retreating Austrians to
tlie ^est.
rne Russians are making progress
in Galicia and Iiukowina, the Austrians
having admitted the withdrawal
of their forces in northeastern Iiukowina.
King Constantino, of Greece has
signed the order demobilizing twelve
classes of the army, amounting to 150,000
men. There is general rejoicing
over the decision. It is not thought
the present government will be able
to continue in power after the army
is disbanded.
The demobilization of the Greek
army is regarded as the direct outcome
of the energetic measures by the
entente allied governments recently
taken in making joint representations
to King Constantine, followed by an
embargo virtually closing Greek ports
Tort Vaux, lying some five miles
northeast of Verdun, which for weeks
past the Trench had heen stubbornly

the hands of the Teutons, according
to Berlin. The men who defended the
fortress to the last surrendered to the
Germans, who also captured a large
number of guns, machine guns and
mine throwers.
Germans and British are fighting desperately
in the vicinity of Ypres, both
sides using their artillery in heavy
bombardments and their infantry in
occasional attacks. In an infantry attack
against the ruined village of
Hooge, east of Ypres, the Germans
captured the British front-line trenches
running through the village, but all
their attacks elsewhere failed.
The Greek commander of the port
of Salonika has boon replaced by a
French naval of floor, and ontry to the
port has boon refused to Greek ship
from Kavala. Moreover, an embargo
has been placed on Greek ships in
French ports.
Accompanying Karl Kitchener as
his staff, and who were dfowned with
him, wore Hugh James O'Reirne,
former councillor of the Rritlsh embassy
at Petrograd and former minis

of Captain Bowen-Co'thurst, charged
with the shooting of F. Sheehy Skeftlngton,

during the recent Irish rebellion. The
defendant is accused of murder.
The news that Earl Kitchener,
secretary of state for war, and his
staff, who wore proceeding to Russia
j aboard the cruiser Hampshire, were
lost off the Orkney Islands, was the
most stunning blow Great Britain has
received since the war began.
The sudden blow struck hy the Russians
along the entire Galician front
of L'75 miles from the Pripet to Roumania,
is, in the unanimous opinion
of the military critics, a brilliant beginning
of the long awaited Russian
offensive.
A profound sensation lias been
caused by the speech made before
the reichstag by Chancellor v<>n
Bothmann-Hollweg, in which be declared
that any further suggestions of
peace by Germany would be futile and
evil.
The naval battle off the coast of
Jutland is claimed to have been n
complete victory for the British by
the naval expert of The Morning Post,
occurred at Kensett, Morrilton and
Greenland.
Washington
Japan's new ambassador to the United
States, Amoro Sato, probably will

September 1. Mr. Sato, now an attache
of the Japanese foreign office,
succeeds Viscount Chimin, the newlyappointed

recently attributed to him on the
subject of President Wilson's peace
efforts.
Dominican rebels, who fled Pimrtn
Plata and Monte Christ! at the ap
proacb of American marines, have

I and indicated that the situation on
I the island was mnro spriniu than rm#t

Ijouis D. Brandies, of Boston, took
his seat as an associate justice of the
supreme court, the sixty-second citizen
to achieve the distinction. Tho ceremonies
were precisely those by which
his predecessors of the last generation
were elected.
Fifty-nine persons are reported to
have been killed and more than a
hundred injured in a tornado which
swept through central and northern
Arkansas.
Domestic
Charles Evans Hughes of New York
and Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana
were nominated for president
and vice president, respectively, by
the Republican national convention in
Chicago.
Theodore Roosevelt was nominated
by the Progressive party as its presidential
candidate in the November
election. John M. Parker of Louisia
na is his running male, and in the
event of Mr. Roosevelt's declination
to make the race Mr. Parker may head
the ticket.
Returning delegates from the Progressive
national convention .are sure
that Theodore Roosevelt will make
the race, and it is stated will proceed
just as if he had already given
his consent.
Champ Clark, speaker of the house
of representatives, says that if Colonel
Roosevelt does not enter (lie race
for president, there will l>e one grand
old "Kentucky hoss race" between
Wilson and Hughes.
The Progressive national committee
will meet in Chicago June 2f> together
with Theodore Roosevelt and
Will consider the matter of Mr Roosevelt's

Part of the increasing apprehension
here is due to the renewed raids in
