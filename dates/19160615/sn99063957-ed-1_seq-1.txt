PLATFORM PLANKS
E
President Wilson Submits
Main Points He Wants It
to Emphasize
ONE PLANK DEVOTED TO
HYPHENATED AMERICANS
Denounces Organizations At
tempting to Influence
Governments Policy
By Fred S. Perguson.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
St. Louis, Mo., Juno 15. Certain hy
phenates organizations in tho United
States chnrged with attempting to in
fluence the course of this government in
its foreign relations will be denounced
iu tho platform to be udopted by tho
democratic, convention.
President Wilson's ideas on interna
tional relations, Mexico, suffrage and
other issues will dominate the platform
It was learned today, however, that tho
tentative draft which was sent to St.
Loir.! by Secretary of War Baker touch
ed th' "high spots," leaving numerous
minor Issues to be worked out by tho
resolutions committee.
Denunciation of organizations en
deavoring to influence this govern
ment's policy wiii como in tho Ameri
canisn plank. Not only will tho organ
izations themselves be denounced, but
any party seeking political advantage
through such organizations, will be in
cluded in tho scoring. Strong declara
tion is inn do that all Americans should
be for America first and. that whole
hearted allegiance should be given this
government to tho' exclusion of all oth
ers. Confidence is expressed in the
great tody of citizenship rcgardles sof
race, origin or creed. They will not 1)1;
mentioned by name. Neither will direct
reference be made to the submarine
controversy or the Lusitania case. Wo
man suffrage will be endorsed. '
Iu addition to tho Americanism
plank, the United Press learned to
day that the president's suggestions are
substantially as follows:
National Preparedness.
A firm demand for a navy that will
be sufficient to protect American in
teresti whether at home or abroad and
an army sufficient to protect our
borders and at the same time from a
nucleus of an efficient fighting force
Mint cm be quickly recruited in case
of wrr.
Voluntary military trnining is urged,
hut compulsory training or scrvico is to
be uvoided.
Mexico.
Not mentioned by name, but the
policy of tho administration to wcuker
nations is upheld, with the declaration
that the aim of the United States
should bo not to interfere in the intern
al nfi'nirs of these weaker nations, ex
cept iu the most extreme cases. Our
policy should be to advise and assist
them, to tho end that they may be
morn prosperous and peaceful; all weak
er nstions have n right to work out
their own destiny.
Foreign Relations.
Neither tho gerernl German subma
rine nor the Lusitnniu case is directly
mentioned. But it is pointed out that
the n'1'iiinistrntion has secured for Am
ericans guarantees of freedom of tho
sens while at the same time peaco lias
mnint'iincd and American rights pre
served through negotiation. Tho Wilson
policy in dealing with belligerent na
tionc. the plank declares, is backed
up by hroccdent of many presidents
and gieat statesmen, who secured Amer
ican rights and averted war, through ne
gotiators. But rrage.
The president declares for woman's
suffrnge in even franker langungo than
the irpublicnn platform, but, like the
republicans, declares it is a state matter
and should be settled by the individual
states.
Tariff.
Th 1'iiderwood tariff law is declared
to bj an act drawn in tho interest of
all th" people in distinction to former
republican tariff laws, enacted la the
interest ofindividuals and special priv
ileged clnsses. Special attention is
called to the income tax as a means of
raising revenuo f-om those best able
y piy it. Indorsement is given of a
scientif c tariff commission.
Labor.
LnbOi' is reminded that, under the
Wilson administration, it has been nc-
corded its rightful place on a basis of
humanity, rather than as a commodity.
Nnmiiig legislation, a child labor law,
henlth safety and welfaro laws are
mentioned. Tho plonk urges closer co-
opernion betreen the government in in-dus'.-les
and workmen to the end that
the industrial f.ibric of the country
may bo utilized in preparedness for
national defense. It declares for an
eight hour day in public offices and
work. Old age pensions for government
employes are referred to iu a section
relatiig to civil service.
