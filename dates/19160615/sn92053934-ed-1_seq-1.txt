Democratic Convention
(Special to The Argus.)
St. Louis, June 15. Temporary
Chairman Glynn's keynote speech in
the opening of the democratic national
convention was pronounced by all who
- hanPit: the most wonttttrful and mas-
terful address of its character ever
sounded in any political convention.
The opening of the assembly was spec
tacular and patriotic in the extreme.
To the strains of the national anthem-
and the waving of 10,1)00 American
fiags the proceedings began. The for-
malities were soon disposed of and
then came the temporary chairman's j
address. (
m me aiceiieMiii uiv inuuin c
autoed through the city as the guests
of the chamber of commerce and there
Five thousand women advocating
the suffrage plank are here with aj
pledge that the success of their plea;
will mean S.Ono.OOO votes to the tick
et. A delightful and pretty spectacle
was the "Golden Lane" in one of the
thoroughfares approaching the con
vention hall. Five thousand women
attired in white with yellow sashes
and parasols, lined the street for 10
blocks. The delegates and visitors to
the convention marched to the hall be
tween these lines.
The democratic national convention
presents many stories in contrast.
There is a distinct difference not only
between if and the one of recent his
tory held in Chicago, but also in the
one which assembled here 12 years
ago. The Chicago national conven
tion made its nominations half
heartedly, while it rudely shattered the
Rooseveil delusion of surpassing
power. The convention here offers no
opportunity for strife or radical dif
fernce of opinion, for any guessing oT
the outcome, or for any sore spots
when it is over. The democratic na
tional convention which was held in
this city 12 years ago was rent with
i feeling. Most of the delegates came
instructed for William Randolph
Hearst for president, although indi
vidually preferring anybody but him.
Bryan, twice beaten for president at
time, had enough of power to divert
the nomination from Hearst to Judge
Alton 11. Parker, and Parker came
back before his nomination was rat
ified, and made Bryan discard his free
silver theories, and accept a resolution
practically committing the party to the
gold standard. The outcome of the
convention sent the party before the
people torn by Irreconcilable factions,
and then it was that Roosevelt rode
into office by an unprecedented major
ity, due not so much to his popular
ity, as to the strife ridden condition
of the democratic, party.
The democratic convention here is
not only harmonious, but enthusiastic
in all its proceedings. It is determined
to renominate President Wilson in a
manner that will show its proper esti
mation of the man. It will adopt a
platform that will do things and mean
things. There may be a little con
test over the vice presidency, bat it
will not involve any bitterness, and
the party will go before the people un
ted and stronger than ever before.
There is a little of similarity between
the discordant, democratic convention
that met in St. Louis in 1904, and the
republican convention that met in
Chicago in 1015. in that both deprived
the bench of able jurists and retired
them to private life.
Democratic
Can the 4,000,000 progressives be
stampeded by the old guard, is the
question which the democrats are
looking for the country to answer. As
these progressives who started out to
fight the "invisible government" rea
i4e that 'they have been hoodwinked
by the "nivisible government''' they
may furnish the necessary answer In
a manner that will surprise the pow
ers that have undertaken to use them.
One of the most active democratic
campaign workers in other years was
Josephus Daniels, now secretary of the
navy, who is one of the most dis
tinguished party leaders present. In
the last national campaign, and the
one immediately proceeding it, he was
chairman of the democratic national
press bureau, and did wonderful work.
Along the sidelines of this convention
there is no one more often consulted
that the South Carolina editor, who is
now a member of President Wilson's
official family. Cnconsciously, of
course, Colonel Roosevelt paid a great
compliment to Secretary Daniels when
he came out recently for industrial
preparedness, -a step he overlooked in
the seven years he was president, and
yet it was taken by Secretary Daniels
a year ago. Un July l.;, rjl:, l nomas
A. Kdison accepted Secretary Daniels'
invitation to become chairman of the
naval consulting board. When the
board was organized it appointed a
sub-committee on production, organi
zation, manufactures and standardiza
tion, and this sub-committee, with th-i
aid of about thirty thousand engineers,
whose help was solicited by President
Wilson's personal appeal, is now com
pleting an inventory of American in
dustry. This inventory is designed,
first, to tell us what we have; second,
to determine what we have not. and
third, to ascertain the best way to
produce what we need. The work of
the sub-committee is rapidly Hearing
completion. The naval appropriation
bill carries $1,000,000 toward a lab
oratory for the board.
"Victor Murdock's satirical reference
to the.republican nominees as a 'tribute
to the arctic circle,' " said a .New York
delegate, "is apt to go down into his
tory, for over in my state the republi
can spellbinders-to-be arc going into
their moth proof closets and bringing
forth their overcoats, overshoes and
mittens, preparatory to meeting the
emergencies of the campaign."
"As far as the progressives in Mis
souri are concerned," said a delegate
from the convention state, "they are
viewing the republican overtures with
keen remembrance of the well known
proposal made by the spider and the
fly."
Remember Dick Kinsella, of the old
Three-Eye league baseball days? Well,
Dick is for the instant a politician in
stead of a baseball scout, tiut he i3
still at the gate. He is assistant door
keeper at this convention. Kinsella
formerly lived at Springfield, but now
claims New York and St Louis both
as his home. Graduated from minor
league baseball, he has beaten the
brushes for some years after major
league material. He has landed a lot
of "hopes" which New York and Pitts
burgh profited. At the present time he
is with the New York Americans, but
the present week will find him with
no time for anything but politics.

sented officially at the convention

Convention
Sidelights
Mr. Bryan may address the conven
tion if he desires. He is here not as a
delegate, but in the same role in which
he attended the late Chicago conven
tion, and likewise all the conventions
of four years ago, that of a humble
scribe. It is 20 years ago since Bryan
has attended the national conventions
in the capacity of a newspaper repre
sentative. After reporting the republi
can convention at St. Louis in ISfo; he
went to Chicago, and after a contest
gained a seat in the democratic con
vention, and it was there that he made
his famous cross of gold speech that
swept the convention off its feet, and
gave him his first presidential nomina
tion. He did not attend the Kansas
City convention in 1000, where he was
renominated, but he was very much in
evidence in St. Louis in 1904. In 190S
he remained away from the Denver
convention, where he was named for
the third time. At Baltimore, four
years ago, it is recalled he had much
to do with the shaping of the platform,
and nomination of Woodrow Wilson.
Today we find him here, back in the
ranks of the newspaper fellows, wear
ing always his characteristic and fa
miliar smile, and to all appearances
enjoying himself to the utmost. And
what is best of all, proclaiming his loy
aytl to Wilson and his purpose to take
the stump for him in the forthcoming
campaign.
COMPLETE REPLY
TOGARRANZANOTE
Washington, June 15. Secretary
Lansing laid before President Wilson
today the completed draft of a note to
General Carranza replying to the de
mand that American troops be with
drawn from Mexico. The president
and Mr. Lansing conferred at length
on tho situation.
Unless some new development for
ces the situation the reply will not be
sent until next week at the earliest
President Wilson and his advisers are
anxious to deal with the (,'arranza
note in such fashion that action can
not be attributed to domestic politics.
As prepared by Secretary Lansing it
is understood the note tlatly declines
to withdraw American troops from
Mexico until the de facto government
has shown both its willingness and its
ability to police the border states.

Eureka, Cab, June 15. Five bodies
have been recovered from the coast
wise steamer Bear, wrecked last night
on Sugar Loaf rock and one boat was
seen today trying for a landing on the
rocky coast according to a message re
ceived here from the light keeper at
Cape Mendocino.
Most of the 182 souls aboard were
reported safe aboard the tug Rescue
which went out from here and first
advices were that all had been rescued.
The fog which brought disaster to the
Bear continued impenetrable today.
Eighty-two survivors of the 21tj per
sons aboard the coasting steamer
Bear, wrecked last night near Cape
Mendocino, had been accounted for
and five persons were known to have
perished at 10:30 today. Indications
were that one boat load was lost, with
good chances that everyone else had
been or would be rescued.
San Francisco, June 15. The steam
er Bear of the San Francisco and Port
land Steamship company, southbound
with 100 passengers and a crew of S2
men from Portland, Ore., for San Fran
cisco, went ashore last night on Su
gar Loaf, Cape Mendocino and pas
sengers and crew were compelled to
take refuge in the ship's lifeboats.
The order to abandon the ship was
given at midnight and all on board got
away safely. The steamer went ashore
during a thick fog but the sea was
reported smooth and assistance from
Eureka, 15 miles away, was making all
haste to the Bear. The battleship Ore
gon, bound from the Bremerton navy
yard for San Francisco, picked up the
Bear's wireless call for assistance at
10:25 p. m. and headed at once full
speed to the vessel's aid. The lifesav
ing station at Eureka, 15 miles north
of the scene of the wreck, started out
a power lifeboat at 10:30 and at mid
night the tug Relief left for the scene
of the wreck.
A radio message received here re
ported that Captain L. N. Nopandcr,
master of the Bear, had ordered the
ship abandoned about midnight and
that all lifeboats had got safely away
from the ship and were waiting in
smooth water the arrival of the rescue
boats, which, in addition to the battle
ship Oregon, the Eureka lifeboat and
the tug Relief included the steamer
Grace Dollar.

OHIO TRAIN CRASH
Washington, June 15. Blame for
the passenger wreck on the New York
New Haven and Hartford railroad at
Bradford, IC I., April 17, in which five
persons were killed and 17 injured,
was placed by the interstate commerce
commission today on the failure of
Flagman Coombs and Engineer Mans
field to attend signals properly.
Old fashioned wooden cars and gas
lights contributed to the fatalities, the
report, said. It pointed out that had
the cars been of modern steel con
struction they would not have been de
stroyed by fire and it would have been
possible to have saved more lives.

in which she sought $10,000 damages
from the doctor. The complaint al

Two Troops of Cavalry in

Laredo, Tex., June 15.
Two American soldiers have
been killed and five wound
ed in a fight with Mexican
bandits 40 miles down the
river at San Ignacio, accord
ing to reports brought here
today.
The fight took place ore
the American side, the Amer
icans engaged, according to
latest reports, being Troops I
and M of the 14 th cavalry,,
under Major Gray, a total of
about 140 men. The ban
dits, numbering more than
one hundred, are said to have
lost six killed and several
wounded.
One hundred Mexican bandits
crossing over the Rio lirande, 40
miles southeast of here, early to.
day attacked the American border
patrol near San Ignacio, killing
two and wounding five, according
to reports sent to F'ort Mcintosh
here, over the field telephone.
The Mexicans expected to find
an insigniticant detachment of
Amerieans. Instead they were met
by troops I and M of the Four
teentli cavalry, lit) strong, under
Major Alonzo Gray. They were
hurled back across the river, los
ing six dead and several wounded.
The bandits made their attack
on Troop M. Troop I, a short dis
tance up the river, heard the
shooting" and hurried to the scene,
arriving in a few minutes. The
attackers soein lost heart. They
retreate-d southward alontr the
river, keeping on the American
side for some distance before
crossing1 back to Mexican soiL
The attack began at 2 a. nr.
The tightint' lasted abnnt 30 min
utes. A bright moon lighted the
srane.
San Antonio, Tex, June 15
Major Cray, w ith two troops of the
1 Uh cavalry, bean the pursuit
early this morning of the hand of
Mexicans that attacked the Ameri.
cans at St. Ignacio, 10 miles south
east of Laredo and it. was assumed
at General Funston's headquarters
that lie alreaely had followed, or
wonld follow the bandits across the
river into Me-xico,
Mexicans numbering about 100 at
tacked troops I and M at 2 a. m. Their
sharp attack was met with a spirited
defense and at the end of half an hour
the Mexicans were in retreat but not
until they had killed two American
troopers and wounded live. From
the brush in the country about the
camp there were recovered by them
the bodies of six Mexicans. Seven dead
horses also were found.
The water soaked clothing of the
dead Mexicans was reported as indi
cating that they had crossed the river
from Mexico. At the time the official
report was made by Major Cray he had
not ascertained the name of the Mexi
cans' leader, nor any information that
showed from where they came or to
just what organization they belonged.
Is Hough Country.
The section of the border country in
which the San Ignacio fight took place
is very similar to the Big Bend country
where, six weeks ago, Mexican bandits
raided the settlements of Bonuillas and
Glenn Springs. San Ignacio, about 40
miles southeast of Laredo, is a small
settlement about a mile from the Rio
Grande, whose population is princi
pally Mexican. A narrow road, used
principally by wagon trains traveling
along that section ot the border where
no railroads have been built is the only
avenue of communication.
