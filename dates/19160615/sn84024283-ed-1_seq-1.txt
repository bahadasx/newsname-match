was found against Old. The Interstate
Commission obtained the indictments
and is prosecuting the cases.
It is alleged that Mangum and Old
would load cars with cattle and then
put in bogns claims for delays, bruis
ing of stock in transit or failure of the
roads to deliver in time to escape de
cline in market values. Claims were
made by them- against the Southern

Catching Up.
Under Woodrow Wilson the United
States is catching up with the rest of
the world. After years of Republican
failure even to propose action, Presi
dent Wilson and the Democrats of
Congress have faced the rural credits
questiorf and have almost completed
legislation upon it.
During all the years of Republican
domination
In Germany the "Landschaften"
system, organized and controlled by
the government, was providing loans
to farmers at 3 per cent.
In France the "Credit Foncier" a
government bank, was providing loans
to farmers at four per cent.
In Russia the "Peasant Land Bank,'
was lending to farmers at four per
cent.
In Switzerland land-credit associa
tintia. nitrated bv the state, were
- - - j -i -
taking care of the needs of the tarm
ers at three and four per cent.
And in Denmark, Great Bntian,
Sweden, Japan and Canada, by various
nlans. the eovernmenb had devised
t
means whereby the financial re quire
ments of the farming population were
provided for on a fair basis.
- Meeker Attacks Dry's Grant.
A Laudable Effort.
(Farmington Times,
Hugh Steele, a merchant and Pres
ident of the Commercial Club at Bis
marck, was in Farmingtan Monday.
His principal purpose here was to try
and interest the Commercial Club at
this place in joining the Bismarck
Commercial Club in an effort they are
making to get a motor route estab
established on the Illinois Southern
from that place to Flat River. The
idea is to have four or five round trips
made between those two points daily,
a distance of only about 10 miles.
Mr. Steele is sanguine that the es
tablishment of such service would
pay from its very inception, and that
it would prove to be immeasurably
profitable, not only to Bismarck, but
toFarmingtpn, as well. For instance,
such service would furnish Farming
ton with St. Louis morning papers by
7 a. M. It would also enable passen
gers to get in or out of Farmington at
almoBt any time of day, over the
Illinois Southern or the Iron Moun
tain, in any direction. For Bismarck
it would it would be almost as ad
vantageous, as a number of residents
there are employed in the Lead Belt,
and such a line would enable them to
get to their work and return home
each evening.

Washington. D. 0.. Jane 6 In a
speech in the House to-day Kepre'
sentative Meeker made a spirited at'
tack on an item in the diplomatio and
consular appropriation bill setting
aside $10,000 to complete arrange
ments for the entertainment of the
fifteenth International Congress on
Alcohlismto be held in the United
States.
Mr. Meeker called attention to the
fact that 840,000 already is available
for entertaing this congress, and then
read the names of American delegates
to similiar congresses held in Europe
in recent years. The list included
manv of the leading Antisaloon
League workers and other prohibition
ists, and few scientific men.
'il should be glad to appropriate
funds to call together a body of men
ot identified with any particular
group of so-called reformers at so
much per reform," said Mr. Meekert.
"This body of men and women, un
der gradually increasing political pow
er in this country, has been steadily
increasing the amount asked from the
Treasury and the Antisaloon League
crowd prohibitionists and now they
have got their hands in the treasury
to the tune of $40,000 and are asking
an additional 10,000.
It is nothing but common snatch
ing from the treasury of the United
States by a group of individuals who
boast that their organization has an
income of more than a million dollars
a year."

Supreme Trust in Wilson. '
Tho Washington correspondent of
the Philadelphia Record sent the fol
lowing dispatch to bis paper:
Political advisers of President Wil
son are convinced, after an extensive
canvass of conditions in various parts
of the country, which was completed
to-day, that the' president is now at
the highest point of popularity he has
enjoyed since his inauguration. The
President's advisers are ful of con
fidence that be is approaching the
period when the national campaign of
Loth political parties will actually be
launched, with a tremendous advan
tage of personal prestige over any of
the prospective opposing candidates.
The optimism of the practical poli
ticians of the Administration is based
on two factors, the President's present
popularity and the disorganiied con
dition of the Republican party, which
has neither a popularly chosen candi
1 date nor an event fixed by circum
stances indelibly in the minds of the
. voters of the country. An analysis
f nnlirinal conditions throughout the
nation, prepared on the basis of in
formation gleaned by the White
House from the various sources of
. political information at its command,
is illuminating. - -
The trouble with the Republican
party lies in this: It lives from day
to day on a diet whose qualities are
varitable and deceiving. . With its nn-
. responsive ear to the ground, it thinks
it can sense an Issue, but finds It, as
new circumstances dally arise, a hol
low mockery. Their trouble has been
to get a candidate and to find an issue
suitable to the exigencies of each day.
JJow'that Hughes Is in the saddle
they are at sea to know whether "the
rider can manage the horse the party
trainers select tor rum, wnetner id
will be one of militaristic of pacifist
bearing. While the Republican party
is floundering around aDout in deeper
ate straits, uncertain as to the candi
date and the issues, the atmospherio
conditions surrounding the Demo'
cratic situations are steadily ImproV'
inf?.
As to the Democratic situation,
there Is'practical unanimity as to the
standarubearer, and no rivalries of i
serious character. That standard
bearer, the President, unlike Taft,
imnroves with aee a candidate who
has in his hands opportunities to play
from day to day a dominating part in
the affjirs of the world.
A great crisis may shatter irretriev
ably every Republican hope and lead
to sure and certain, victory for the

Burk & Hobbs at Farmingtan.
(Farmington News)
The bia tabernacle being erected on
thePim'lot for the Burk-Hobbs re
vival is rapidly nearing completion
On account of the heavy rains which
fell almost all of Tuesday work did
not begin on the tabernacle in earnest
until Wednesday, but it has been
hustled aloncr at a lively rate since
that time. Rev. R. E. Foard, of Fes
tus. has charse of the work on the
building arid is an expert at the busi
ness. Most of the work ou the big
building has been donated.
The dimensions of the structure are
82x82 with a choir loft addition large
enough to accommodate 150 singers,
The seating capacity of the mam
building will be 1500. Provision for
the easy erection of additional seating
space has been made
The meeting will not begin until
June 18th. A message was received
on Thursday of last week stating that
if agreeable to the local committee
the evangelists would come here in
time to begin the meeting on June
11th. The committee wired that
everything would be in readiness for
the meeting by that time. On Mon
day the following message was re
celved by Rev. O. II. L. Cunningham
of the local committee
'Poteau, Okla,, June 5, 1918. Under
the leadership of Burk & Hobbs the
city of Poteau is now being shaken
bv the Dower of God . as' never in its
history. Our leading men are turning
to God in great numbers
a religious disaster
June 11th."
In loving remembrance of our dear
ones, who departed this life one year
ago. Death visited our home the 4th
of last May and claimed our jon and
brother, Gussie II. Williams.
On June 7th, again our home was
made sad by the death of husband and
father.
One bv one the frail links part.
Hand drops from hand, and heart
from heart,
One bv one the sweet things given,
To brighten eartiigo back to heaven,
Death is the grim antagonist of life;
and yet how seldom we think of it un
til the shadow falls across our own
path hiding forever from our eyes
all traces of our loved ones, whose
living smiles were the sunlight of our
existence. Death! Do we realize
it in all its horror, as we followed our
loved ones to the silent city? How
hard it was to realize that they were
gone. Gone from the happy home
life and we were left to take up the
burdens of life anew, unshared by
their love and sympathy.
But such are the changes of life; the
hand that holds ours to-day in tender
clasp of love may soon be beyond our
reach in the cold and silent tomb.
Friends may think the wound is heal
ed but little do they know the sorrow
there is concealed. How we miss
their presence, the sound of their
voice, no one knows only those who
have followed loved ones to the silent
city. The memory of those dear ones
will never iaue, ana our nearts istni
love to linger where onr dear ones
are laid.
Sadly missed by family.
