traces of untidiness which the flus
tered maids might have left behind
them. •'I'm sdiemn in spite of my
self."
"Please don't," objected Molly al
most piteously. "If you turn solemn
my last prep is gone."
"I didn't mean to," apologized Kern.
"But getting married is rather a
weighty thing after all. Besides that,
my conscience hurts me."
"it should, I suppose," agreed Molly.
"Anybody's should. Why?"
"About Sledge. Molly, he's a nice
old fatty."
"I never can remember him with an
ugly thought," admitted Molly, "i
daren't sympathize with him, though,
lie started a rough game with me, and
1 beat hlm. I had to be rough to do it."
"We were mean to him," declared
Kern. "I've a notion to marry him
myself to make up for it."
The pang of distaste which Molly
felt at that speech was not jealousy;
far from it. If anything, it was a
mere questioning of Kern's taste in
making such a remark. That was it!
"I suppose poor Bert's lonesome,"
she suggested. "We really ought to
go down and keep him company untii
the minister comes."
"Murder!" objected Kern. "Molly,
you haven't a hit of style about you.
You mustn't even see Bert until you
walk in the parlor on your father's
arm and take him for better or—well,
for better."
"You don't seem any too hopeful,"
laughed Molly, looking longingly at the
couch, but remembering her gorgeous
gown. "I don't believe you like Bert
very well."
"Indeed I do!" remonstrated Kern al
most too quickly. "lie's still the hand
somest fellow I ever saw—tall UDd big
and tine looking and the very best
dancer I ever swung across a floor
with. I just couldn't get through en
vying you when I first came."
"Yes. I was jealous of you," con
fessed Molly. "Bert Is a fine dancer."
"All the girls will be envious of you,"
went on Fern, determined to say nice
things. "You should be very happy,
Molly, about the new home and the
fine business prospects and the social
triumphs which I know are waiting
for you, aud you'll have a polished
husband, of whom you can always he
proud, and just bushels and bushels of
love, of course."
"Of course," agreed Molly, looking at
the little Dresden clock on the mantel.
"Goodness, Fern, the miuistcr is due
to arrive in ten minutes, and Jessie
Peters isn't here yet!"
"If she knew the importance of your
informal invitation to call this after
noon she'd have been here hours ago,"
T two i avoutrei. iur.
ly, that of nil your girl friends she was
the one you insisted on having here.
She's a darling!"
"She's true," added Molly. "Some
how I always feel safe, even against
myself, when she's nromul me. I love
you to death. Fern, but you're wicked."
"1 guess I am," giggled Kern. "1
never can see anything else when
there's a chance for devilment."
Mina knocked at the door. '
"Miss Peters." announced Mina,
gloating once more over her lia ndiwork
as she surveyed the handsome Molly
and the pretty Kern.
"Have her come right up," directed
Molly, brightening, and waited with
an expectant smile, which changed to
a look of concern when she saw the
poorly concealed traces of tears in Jes
sie's eyes.
she ask
"What's the matter, .Jessie7" she ask
ed, stepping hastily forward, and Jes
sie. forgetting or not seeing that pain
fully fluffy wedding gown, threw her
self dismally into Molly's arms.
"They didn't want me to come!" she
gulped. "But I had promised you. ana
Dicky said I might."
"Where is Dicky?" asked Molly.
"He went on downtown on an er
rand. He'll be back after me In hair
an hour."
"Why didn't they want you to
come?" asked Molly anxiously.
"On account of your father."
"Father!" gasped Molly. "What
about him?"
"Don't you know?" wondered Jes
sie, half crying again.
"Why, no, child," worried Molly.
"What is it? Tell me," and she heard
Fern slipping quietly out of the room.
She led Jessie over to the couch, ami
all forgetful of her shimmering satin,
with its beautifully uncreased folds,
sat down.
"It's the street car stock." Jessie ex
plained. "Dicky just came out to the
house with the news. There is to bi'
no consolidation. The old tracks are
to be torn up three years from now.
and nobody would have the stock for
a gift. And it's Thanksgiving day!"
"That's only some wild rumor," Mol
lv assured her, wondering, neverthe
less, At this new and strange turn of
financial gossip. "Even if it were true
though, how is father to blame?"
"I don't know, except that my fa
ther's like a maniac about it all and
forbadcAne to come near this house."
Molly held her closer.
1 "Dicky brought me. though. He said
that he didn't think Mr. Marlev wav
the thief, and that if he was you
weren't, and that if I wanted to come
I \Yas coming. He's a good Dicky.
Molly." and hero Jessie cried a little
I more, just on account of Dicky s good
ness.
"It isn't father's fault, it's mine,"
confessed Molly, aghast, as she began
j for the first time to fully realize tu«
! hundreds of real sufferers in this high
; q niK ] R( ] game which she and Sledge
,,] 1V ed "Mr Sledge wanted to
^ me and , was engaged to Bert,

j Sledge tried to break father, and !
j don't know ltow many people besides
j ns have had to suffer for that. It's

1
"Sledge is a beast," charged Jessie
vehement b'. "He is the most cruel
and vicious man in the world, I think.
Dicky says he should be killed."
"He isn't really so bad." declared
Molly, trying to be just "lie's like
other strong people. He doesn't know
how badly he hurts. He's like a foot
ball player shaking hands with you."
"He is a brute!" shuddered Jessie.
"I stood by him in Maberly's candy
store yesterday, and ,1 was actually
afraid of him for fear 1 would annoy
him by being iu his way aud he might
turn around and be rough to me."
Molly laughed softly at the idea of
Sledge's being rough to little Jessie
Peters.
"Why, he'd be so gentle to you as to
he ridiculous," she said. "Not even
Dicky could be more gentle."
Jessie straightened immediately.
"How absurd!" she laughed. "You
don't know Dicky, Molly. He isn't like
other men. Why, when we found that
we had lost every cent we had iu the
world and would be in debt besides
and would even lose our home father
blamed mother for signing the mort
gage and has been cross with her ever
since he got into difficulties, and there
isn't a better father thau mine. But
Dicky! Why, when the West End
bank failed because it held too many
street railway securities and Dicky lost
the $6.000 he saved to buy us a borne,
do you know what he did? He took
me to the theater and patted my hand
all through the show and told me how
young we were, and how much money
we were going to make, and how happy
we'd be even if we didn't, and he
wouldn't hear to father's having us
postpone our wedding for a minute.
Why, Molly, he can't do without me.
and I can't do without him. It's won
derful!"
Molly patted Jessie's shoulder
thoughtfully.
"I guess you and Dicky love each
other very much," she /suggested.
"I don't know how to tell it," con
fessed Jessie shyly. "Love is such a
tremendous thing, Molly. It cries."
Molly was startled Into silence.
What was this thing that she was do
ing? She was entering on the most
serious relationship in life as the ter
mination of a game in which love, such
as Jessie knew had had no part, in
which even romance, to which every
girl is entitled at least once, had been
made subservient to business, to stock
manipulations, to real estate deals aud
to stubbornness. The-, only one who
had been at all romantic—and she

she remembered it—big, coarse

she was envious.
"I'm so happy I'm selfish," replied
Jessie comfortably. "I've even for
gotten to ask why you were so insist
ent this morning upon having me come
over at such an exact minute."
"I wanted you at my wedding,"
smiled Molly.
"Molly!" exclaimed Jessie. "That's
why you and Fern are all in white.
Oh, and I came over Iu my old blue
tailored suit."
"That's lucky," laughed Molly. "You
know the old rime, 'Souethiug old aud

ly, putting her arm re lovingly

of Minn.
"The minister is her whispered
Fern in her most mystiis air. and

Me, you come down with me. I'll senti
up Mr. Marley. and when he and Mol
ly start downstairs you're to play the
wedding mardi, while I hack Bert up
under the chandelier. Now, everybody
to their posts."
She flew down the stairs and hur
ried back to tlie den. A moment later
they heard a shriek, aud, running to
the den. they found Frank Marley
sprawled on the floor with Coldman's
check crumpled in his nerveless fin
gers.
CHAPTER XVIII.
Molly Starts For a Drive.
A LOOSENING of his collar, a
dash of cold water into his
face, a sip of brandy, restored
Frank Marley to conscious
ness. hut he was an old man. He
seemed visibly to have shrunk iu his
clothes and the flesh to have sagged
iu his cheeks, lie tried to smile brave
ly when they set him iu tils chair, but
the attempt was a pathetic failure.
"I guess I'm out of the game," he
confessed. "My heart's had."
Molly took up the telephone.
"I'll call Dr. Brand." she anxiously
decided.
"Don't!" he begged, stopping her with
his hand. "It isn't physical; it's men
tal. I've lost my nerve. Molly, Sledge
wins. We re broke."
"How can that be?" she puzzled, un
able to comprehend it. "You even
showed me the check."
"Here it is." said Bert, who had pick
ed it from the floor and was smoothing
it out.
"Worthless!" Marley groaned at sight
of it "I can sue for it, hut they'll beat
me."
Bert edged in between Molly and
Fern, so that he could stand directly
in front of Marley and see his face.
"Do you mean to tell me that our
whole plan has fallen to the ground?"
Marley nodded miserably.
"How did it happen?"
"I don't quite understand." wavered
Marley. "1 haven't the details, but by
Borne trick Sledge lias secured fifty
year franchises for every street in the
city, including mine."
"How docs that affect you?" persist
ed Bert, his eyes falling again to the
check. That document looked so much
like real money that he was inclined to
believe it rather than Marley.
"Affect me!" protested Marley, warm
ed into a trifle more of life as lie ex
plained. "It renders my street rail
way company a junk heap. We lose
everything."
"But the sale." insisted Bert.
"Invalid. Goldman claims he was
not authorized to act."
"I suppose that if the sale had been
a profitable one you never would have
beard of the invalidity."
Marley smiled and shook his head.
"Then all our plans are off." discov
ered Bert "The Porson tract is un
salable for enough to clear its own
mortgage. Your stock and mine are
worthless. You lose this house. I am
stuck for the loan I made to give you
control. We haven't money enough
to go into business, and we can't go
b£?k east. Molly, it looks like a jwst
ponement!"
Jessie Peters edged closer and slip
ped her arm around Molly.
"Not on my account," protested Mar
ley. fumbling at his collar, and he
arose feebly to adjust it before the
muntel mirror.
Molly, seeing that he wavered, hur
ried to his support.
He turned to her aud put his hands
on her shoulders.
"I'm sorry. Molly." he said simply,
locking into her eyes with more fond
ness t lia ii he was in the habit of show
ing her.
"We can stand it," she comforted
him. "After all, it's only just. I feel
so much less wicked if we suffer with
all the poor people we have Helped to
ruin."
A short laugh from Bert interrupted
her, and she turned to him with a ris
ing flame in her eyes, but little Jes
sie Peters had caught her hand aud
was looking up into her face.
The minister, a tali eltap who had
won the hammer throwing medal iu
his last year at eoliegc, had withdrawn
discreetly to the parlor when the con
versation had begun, hut now came
hack apologetically. „
"I am sorry to urge you." he observ
ed, looking at his watch. "I have a
brief appointment, but I can return."
"I don't know," hesitated Molly,
glancing at Bert. "Wait just a min
ute."
The thin butler, who was now cross
eyed, came through the hall to the
front door, which lie opened, aud a
second later he was sitting in the um
brella rack.
"Say, youse!" bellowed the voice of
Sledge as his huge bulk, followed by
Tommy Keeler, slammed back through
the hall, filling the perspective like a
ferry crowding into her dock. "Is it
all over?"
Fern was the first oue to recover
from the shock.
"No," she said meekly, but her eyes
danced of the devil as they met those
of Tommy Reeler.
"Then it's off!" yelled Sledge and
grabbed the startled Molly by the
wrist.
Bert endeavored to throw himself in
between the two and to face Sledge,
but that experienced old ward leader,
who had not forgotten the training of
his early days, gave him a quick el
bow in the pit of the .stomach, and
Bert doubled up in the middle like a
jackknife and dropped heels up on a
couch, clawing for breath while Sledge,
as resistless as an auto dray, dragged
the struggling Molly steadily toward
the front door.
Opposite tiie library he met with an
Unexpected defender. The tall young
preacher threw himself upon the big
ooy bodily, avoided the pile driver el
bow, grabbed Sledge arouud the neck
with his steel-like left wrist and with
his right fist poked him in the jaw.
Siedgo shook his head and spluttered
us he would iu a showen bath, but
never let go of Molly's wrist aud plod
ded on toward the front door, trying
to force off the clutch of the tall young
minister with his mighty left arm.
The minister, whose heart was par
ticularly in Ids work because this was
the first opportunity he had ever en
joyed to wallop a man in a righteous
cause, industriously slammed Sledge
ou his other jaw, and the smack was
like a kiss at a country dance.
Tommy Rcclcr, who had been clear
ing the legs of the limp butler out of
Ihe path of progress, now sprang on
the minister's back and pinioned his
busy arms from behind, while Sledge

ward the Front Door.
steadily dragged them all toward the
front door, with Molly now screaming
„nnr-xtunu BST BUS"
tress' waist, jerking her from behind.
"Mina!" cried Molly. "Let go! You're
pulling my arm in two!"
The weight of Tommy Iteeler told at
last. The minister's hold on Sledge's
neck loosened, and he and Tommy
tumbled back with a thud into the mid
dle of the parlor, rolling under the
very chandelier which was to have been
very chandelier which was to have been
the pivot of the wedding. Tommy,
who had risen to be a boss contractor
largely through muscular will, enjoyed
a lively tussle with the young minis
ter, but luck favored him, and he land
ed on top.
"Now, you behave!" he panted, with
his hand at the minister's throat and
his fist held iu convenient range for
microscopical scrutiny. "I don't want
you to start anything with me because
I daren't punch a preacher."
With as steady a progress as if he
had been marching behind a hearse
Sledge dragged Molly out of the hall
and across the porch and to the door
of his waiting limousine, into which
he pulled her with the same careful
force as a man landing a particularly
game bass.
"Home, Billy!" he chuckled to the
driver.
Molly's first and perfectly normal ac
tion when the limousine drove away
with her was to indulge in a splendid
case of hysteria, not one detail of
which was omitted She laughed, she
cried, she shrieked, she pounded her
heels on the floor of the ear, she tried
to jump out of tlie machine, she laugh
ed and she cried again, and Sledge
was so scared that he wilted his col
lar.
"You're all right, Miss Molly," he
hoarsely cooed over and over, hut final
ly a happy thought struck him, and,
opening a forward window, he gruffly
directed, "Say, Billy, stop at Sheeny
Jake's and bring out a slug of rye."
Molly dabbed at her eyes with the
filmy lace handkerchief which she had
intended to carry under the cut glass
chandelier.
"You are hurting my wrist," she com
plained.
He let go slowly and looked at the
deep white indentations of his big fin
gers. He almost blubbered.
"Km a slob!" he confessed. "Why,
Miss Molly. I'd saw my leg off before
I'd hurt you! Why, doggone it, you're
like a flower or a butterfly or a canary
to me! Look at that wrist!"
She drew her hand away, with a
splendid assumption of cold disdain,
although, through some freak or fancy,
she could see the giggling face of Fera.
"Mr. Sledge, where are you taking
me?"
"nome," he informed her. "We're
goana get married."
In spite of her tearing anger, there
was somethiug in this so ridiculous
that she was compelled to laugh, and
with the first peal Sledge paled.
"Hit 'or up!" he yelled to his driver.
"I want that booze quick! Please
don't. Miss Molly; you're all right!"
And be made the futile attempt of
mopping his brow with the foolish Ut
ile handkerchief which he somehow
found iu his hand.
"Let me out of here!" she demanded.
"Nix!" he gruffly replied. "You don't
fool me again. I'm goana marry you.''
"You can't," she told him. "It isn't
legal if I don't say 'Yes.' "
"You got to say 'Yes,' " he insisted.
"Look here, Molly, 1 couldn't let you
marry that pinhead. He's a woman
fusser. He's been mixed up with them
since you were engaged, aud he'd nev
er stop."
"It won't do you any good to belittle
Bert," she flared.
"I can't," he informed her. "I kept
my mouth shut, but now I got to spill
wliat I know. These pretty men are
always worse after they're married.
Bert's a bum! He's got a streak of
yellow the size of a canal. He ain't
got the brains of a tadpole. He can't
make a living unless somebody helps
him. You'd hate his hones in six
months. So don't you marry him!"
"I am the oue to decide on that,"
Molly indignantly advised him.
Sledge looked at her a moment con
templatively, then he opened the for
ward window.
"Stop!" be ordered Billy, and closed
the window again. "All right; go to
it; decide," he unexpectedly told her
as the machine stopped. "But be on
the level now. Do you love Bert?"
"That's my affair," she evaded, flush
ing.
"Naw, it ain't," he insisted. "It's
mine. Do you love him enough to bo
poor with him? Now, be square."
Molly was silent
"You don't," he concluded. 'Tut It
the other way. How about Bert 7
Now, don't kid yourself."
Again Molly was silent She conld
answer that question if she chose, and
the picture of little Jessie Peters' sub
lime adoration of Dicky Reynolds came
before her eyes, linked with the mem
ory of Bert's face when he had sug
gested a postponement Being broke
was an incident with Jessie and Dicky
and entirely aside from their love.
With Bert and herself it was the love
which had been incidental.
Sledge waited a reasonable time for
her to allege Bert's enthusiasm.
"Home!" he commanded Billy. "You
see. I'm wise, Miss Molly. That pin
head couldn't love anybody enough to
go the distance. I can. I'll murdef
anybody you name. Want anybody
killed?"
"You!" she savagely retorted and
then, to her own surprise, laughed.
She had put her hand on the catch of
the door; but, since he made no at
tempt to stop her, she left it there.
"You don't hate me that much," he
calmly informed her. "You like me.'*
Again she laughed, this time at his
naivete. "You see, it's like this," he
explained: "I'm a big slob, and I'm
rough. I ain't pretty, and I know It.
but 1 otai-t iMMuutUiuK tuiy minute,
and when I do I can finish it. Yop
don't know it, but you're strong for
that."
With a thrill Molly realized that bo
was right In this. She did admire
force. She admired Sledge, and, now
that she had time to think it over,
something within her responded to his
direct and simple method of breaking
up her wedding.
"But love is different," she replied,
arguing more to herself than to him.
"Nix!" he denied. "It's tlie strongest
thing there is."
"Love cries," Molly mused, remem
bering Jessie.
"It hurts," he agreed. "It used to
Bound like a joke to me—till I got It.
Now' I want to break chains with my
chest. Molly, when I think of you I
could holler. I don't dare touch you.
It makes me weak. You don't want
to go back and marry Bert, <lo you?"
His voice had in it a trembling plea,
so un-Sledge-like that she would liav®
pitied him bad she not been so ab
sorbed in her startling attitude toward
the question lie had asked her. Noth
ing seemed more remote and absurd
than that she should go back and
marry Bert
"No!" she bluntly confessed.
Sledge opened the front window,
"Hurry up!" he admonished Billy,
and Molly laughed.
CHAPTER XIX.
Molly Feels Sense of Relief.
S OMEHOW she felt a sense ot
vast relief, of freedom, of ex
hilaration in her release from
Bert It would have been wick
ed to have entered into a lifelong mar
riage with him, and now she seemed
always to have had an undercurrent
of that feeling which she had hidden
from herself. A little trace of reseut*
ment rose in her that girls were taught
to look so lightly upon the marriage re
lation that it might be entered into so
