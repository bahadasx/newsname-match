TOLEDO, OHIO
While searching for treasures in
the "archives" of. the Journal of
fice, an old "Certificate of Mem
bership" in the Perrysburg Fire
department, bearing the name of
John Lally, was discovered. John
commenced his instructions in the
"Art Preservative" in the Jour
nal office many years ago, and is
now superintendent of a big pub
lishing company in Somerset,
Ohio. The certificate was sent as
a reminder of other days, and the
following letter is his acknowledg
ment of its reception :
Somerset, O., June 7, 191 G.
Dear Ed: The certificate of
membership in the Perrysburg
Fire department which you sent
me reached me this morning. How
vividly it recalled to mind the in
cidents of the days and nights
when the boys used to congregate
in the old engine house on Front
street. I can sec them yet, and
can name almost every one of the
original members of that com
pany, although nearly a quarter
of a century has rolled by, as I
note by the date of the card that
the organization took place in De
cember, 1891. Sqveral of the
members have crossed tho great
divide; others have left the old
burg for new fields of labor, but
still many "may be found around
the old haunts. Those were the
happy days when tho old fire
company was in its flower. What
meetings! What blowouts par
ticularly the latter used to be
held in the old room, and if mem
ory serves me right, fire wasn't
the only thing fought about the
place.
The certificate furnishes us with
the date of organization, but it
says nothing about tnc ending ol
tho career of the famous or
should I say notorious company
of fire fighters,
The house which harbored tho
company on Front street has van
ished, and tho members havo been
scattered in many directions, but
it. is safe to say there is not one of
them living who does not occasion
ally recall, with at least a smile,
some amusing incident which
transpired there, as the hpurs
were whilcd. away n qongonial
recreation,
In an old scrap book I un
earthed the enclosed clipping
which appeared in the Journal,
and which records the sounding of
"taps" for the old company:
No more tho gay and festive firemen
congregate at the olu engine room, lor
the purpose of dxchancinc ideas re
garding the best methods to bo pur
sued in subduing the fiery element.
No more will the stentorian tones of
Fireman Scott's voice be heard at a
special meeting in his customary
speech "Gentlemen, tho motion be
fore the house is', will wo havo a
spread all those in favor of 'expend
ing $2.'20 for a banquet will say 'aye.'
Tho vote is unanimous, and we will
nrocced to banouot." All these thincs
have changed, and with the disbanding
of the old company there dies also ono
of tho most peculiar benefit associa
tions ever organized; During tho
health of tho members each ono xj,
lined lor tailing to be prcem at the
banquets. Work m the various de
grees was conferred at any time when
three or more members could run in a
stranger as a candidate. These three
members would immediately fiho all
absentees.

By Dwioiit R. Canpield
When Joseph Wamplcr, by
order of the "U. S. government,
came to the foot of the rapids in
81G, for the purpose of surveying
the site of a city, this was one vast
wilderness.
Coming up from the river's
bank, one was immediately
plunged into a deep and dense
forest ; and as the stream was left
behind, the wood became more en
tangled and the swamps more im
passible. By day, the hundreds of
different song birds vied with each
other in the making of the sweet
est music; while at night, wild
aninyils of every species roamed
in search of prey, and betwixt
their weird bowlings and the song
of the anopheles, the night was
made hideous.
But at length tho work was
completed and the surveyor
wended his way back to Ft.
"Washington. As laid out, the new
city was divided into lots GG by
1G5 feet. Broad avenues and wtde
streets separated the large blocks
that were to contain the public as
well as private buildings of this
new (jity of the "West.
Even after the plat of the town
had been made, a number of years
intervened before any real moves
were made towards its settlement.
Orleans contained all of tho busi
ness places, the taverns and
school. Lake vessels went past
and docked at the latter city.
Maumee was then in its infancy,
but quite a town, while the post
office Avas there as well as the
county seat of "Wood county.
Thomas R. McKnight is credited
with having erected the first resi
dence in Perrysburg, w'hioh was
on lot No. 144, It wa.s a log house.
As 1ms been noted in a former
article, the county soat was re
moved from Maumeo to Perrys
burg m 1823. About the same
time the old Exchange Hotel was
built by Samuel Spafford. After
a number of lots had been sold in
Perrysburg, which moneys was
used for public purposes, tho first
court house and jail wore built.
Tim old court house stood on the
lot at present owned by Fred Hil
labrand on Front street, while the
log jail was directly behind it.
The Hollisters, John and Fra.uk,
lived in the woods near tho river
just below the present site of the
Monument Park. "With the rc
nmval of the county seat here,
Orleans was soon depopulated and
Perrysburg really began its pres
ent history. Stores and residences
wuvo built, Town lota sold rapid
ly, Trade bogun to flourish. Emi
grants were continually arriving,
and things began to look like a
city. Spafford 's Exchange was
the finest hotel in the middlo west.

moved to our town during the

mentioned: John "Webb, who set

next few years, came tho IIol-
