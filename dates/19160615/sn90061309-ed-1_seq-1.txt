ALUMNI BANQUET
Holy Rotary School Alumni Associ
ation Hold Annual Reception
and Banquet
Realizing that the greatest asset
any school can have is the moral
support of loyal alumni, and feeling
that their individual loyalty would
be a factor, all the more potent
were it merged into an organization,
the Alumni of Holy Rosury School
in May 1915 formed an association
for the purpose of linking the past
with the present and thus secure
the future The Association held
it's second Annual Reception and
Banquet in the Woodman Hull
on Tuesday evening June 6th.
At 8 o'clock a happy crowd of
olumui and their friends betook
themselves to the banquet room
where covers were prepared for 61
persons. Two long rows of tables
were spread, bearing quantities of
cut flowers, beautiful in their
appointments of crystal. The de
licious menu was prepared by the
ladies of the Holy Rosary Altar
Society who spared neither time
nor labor to make the banquet a
success. It was faultlessly served
for which great credit is due to the
management The hall was adorn
ed with festoons in the class colors
and the walls were profusely draped
with stars and stripes. During the
banquet the orchestra excellently
discoursed some joy-giving music
and Miss Bessie Montgomery
furnished us a treat from the violin.
The following gentlemen favored
is with talks. Father Ryan, Or.
Malley, Mr. W. Fahy, Ed Spalding,
Alexis Hays, Alexis Montgomery, J.
B, Hagan, Frank Lossun, Leo Boar
man, Dick Asbury and Paul Robey.
Father Ryan, in his character
istically happv manner, after com
plimenting the graduates on the
completion oi a successful school
life, gave them a practical exhor
tation to extend their influence for
good in the ordinary wavs of life.
In the course of the speech
making, among other things it was
said in substance, "Knowledge
perfects the mind" One should
therefore aim nt acquiring during
life as much of it as lies within his
reach. One need not be a bookworm
Dor need he devote his evenings
and other free time to study unless
he takes the same pleasure in it
that another does in a novel or a
newspaper but he should take an
exalted view of his responsibility
for every faculty he possesses ami
as the mind is among the most
important of his faculties he should
not pass up opportunities of easily
storing it with useful accurate
knowledge. This pleasurable occu
pation raises one's tastes above a
fondness for trashy novels and
grovelling thoughts and keeps hi in
abreast of nur age.
It gives one too an honored
place among people of refinement
and culture, not perhaps as a pro
found scholar, but as one who
appreciates the mental gifts with
which he is endowed and makes an
effort to bring them to perfection"
After the last speaker on the pro
gram sat down, bringing a delight
ful evening to a close all present
contributed to the harmony of the
occasion by singing 'Auld Lang
Syne'.
Among those who came from a
distance to attend the banquet
were the following. Mrs. Andrew
Grimm of Louisiana, Alice and
Noriiert Hays of Hannibal Greg
Buckman. Earl Kendrick and Elmer
(Continued ou back page)
Two Pretty Parties.
Mrs. Arthur Ely, one of last
season's popular brides very charm
ingly entertained a number of her
friends on Monday and Tuesday
afternoons of this week, in honor of
her sisters, Mrs. P. A. Thomas of
Palmyra, Miss Bernice Thompson,
of Macon, and her aunt Mrs. Belle
Thomas of Palmyra.
About forty invitations were
sent out for Euchre on Monday
afternoon and promptly at 2:30
thirty ladies gladly wended their
way to Mrs Ely's pretty apartments
in the Proctor Home in the north
part of town, where they were met
at the door by little Miss Imogene
Thomas niece of the hostess, and
ushered to the punch bowl presided
over by Miss Thompson who served
a drink tho not nectar but surely
fit for the "Gods "
The house was tastily decorated
with the season's flowers: in fact it
was almost a bower so numerous
were the roses and other "posief."
The tally cards were also 'flowery'
in keeping with the decorations,
and the game of six hand euchre
so much indulged in by the ladies
who were in attendance seems as
new and as much enjoyed as the
story of romance that "never grows
old"
On Tuesday afternoon about
forty ladies were invited to bring
their fancy work, and one at a
short distance would have guessed
it to be a "Conversational Social"
ralher than a work party. However
both afternoons passed pleasantly
and quickly. After n delightful
salad course with an ice all depart
ed expressing opinion of Mrs Ely
as an ideal hostess for surely she
had contributed her part in helping
to make the lives of her many
friends in the words of the poet
"One glad sweet song."
Hughes and Fairbanks
Our Republican friends have met
at Chicago and for their candidate
drafted a man from the beach ot
the Supreme Caurt. Ctiarles E.
Hughes. For Vice President, for
mer vice president Fairbanks, was
given the nomination. This is as
strong a ticket as our Republican
friends could hook up
All the good issues for the cjuh
try huve been appropriated by the
Democrats who are actually pa;
ting laws on the statute books
which our Republican frieuts
should have pu' years ago, but did
not because these laws are in the
interest of all the people, and not
the favored few.
The Progressive convention was
also in session at Chicago and alter
the delegates and others wearing
away their lungs cheering for Roose
velt and then nominating him tor
president, ie declined and th.is
leaves the party which four yeirs
ago palled over four million votes,
without a leader. They may de
cide to fill out their ticket and thus
keep up their organization.
