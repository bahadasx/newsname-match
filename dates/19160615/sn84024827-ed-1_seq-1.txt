Downfall In Flag Day
Speech At Washington
DISLOYALTY IN U. S.

After Parade
WASHINGTON. June 14. A charge
that foreign born citizens of the' Unit
ed States are trying to levy political
blackmail and to undermine the influ
ence of the national government was
made by President Wilson in a "Flag
Day" speech here today. His asser
tion sounded the keynote of one of the
foremost issues on which he will go
before lhe country for re-election, and
touched upon a platform declaration
which will be submitted by the admin
istration to the St. Louis Concention.
The President spoke before a crowd
of thousands gathered at the foot of
the Washington Monument, after he
had reviewed for five hours a great
preparedness parade at the head of
which he himself had marched down
Pennsylvania Avenue." He declared
that not since the Civil War had it
been tested as it now is being tested
whether the Stars and Stripes stood
for any one United purpose.
"There is disloyalty active in the
United States and it must be absolute
ly crushed." declared the President,
speaking emphatically. "It proceeds'
from a minority, a very small minori
ty, but a very active and subtle minor
ity. He Scorns Hyphenates
"It works underground but it also
shows its ugly head where w can see
it; and there are those at this moment
who are trying to levy a species of
political blackmail, saying 'do what
we wish in the interest of foreign sen
timent or we will wreak our ven
geance at the polU.' That is the sort
of thing against which the American
nation will turn with a mighty tri
umph of sentiment which will teach
these "gentlemen once and for all that
loyalty to this flag is the first test of
tolerance in the United States."
The resident's words wire taken as
an open challenge to foreign born Am
ericans who, he had learned from for
eign language newspapers and other
sources, are opposing him for re-elec-i
tion. Officials close to him said he
was outlining his stand on what he
had determined to make a predomi
nant issue in -'lis campaign.
In Preparedness March
While the Democratic convention
was being opened at St. Louis, Mr.
Wilson devoted' the entire day to the
Flag Day and preparedness demon
strations. Carrying a large American
flag he walked from the Capitol to the
White House at the head of more than
50,000 marchers, including many high
government officials, employes of all
the government departments and of
the capitol's business houses, compan
ies of cadets, national guardsmen.
Union and Confederate veterans and
members of commercial and social or
ganizations. Cabinet In Parade
The parade started from the Capi
tol guards and as its head passed the
I?' Fuars ana "s ' T u "'S
1 lute House the Pres dent dropped

ing stand. He was joined there by J
Secretary McAdoo. Redfield, Lane and
Wilson, Postmaster General Burleson
and Attorney General Gregory who j
had marched at the head of the em
ployes of their departments arid by
Secretary Lansing. As soon as the
last marchers passed the stand, five
hours later, t"ie President went to the
monument grounds where his address
formed the principal part of an hour's
patriotic exercises.
Before he began speaking cannon
fired a national salute of 21 guns and
the marine band played the Star Span
gled Banner while a huge flag was
drawn slowly to the top of the white
monument, 555 feet above the ground.
Secretary Lansing presided and in in-
troducing the President emphasized ,

WASHINGTON. June 14 With all
government departments closed in ob
servance of Flag Day, there was no
developments here today in the Mexi
can situation. A few telegrams reach
ed the war and state departments but
officials said they contained nothing
of importance. A message to the na

said a large number of Carranza
troops were being transferred by wat

reason for the movement was not re-

presence of American troops on Mexi

haps a lesser one, among those con

real key to the situation, many of
those in close touch with it believe,
is the apparent collapse of the de facto
government's effort to adjust the finan

foreign aid.

procured only on a flat cash. basis.

It is evident that many officials be-
Heve the collapse of the de facto gov-.

a collapse, however, it is feared there j

Peons Uninformed
With most of the population utterly
ignorant of true conditions, it was
pointed out t.'iat agitators might have
an easy task in spreading the impres

for Mexico's economic and other trou
