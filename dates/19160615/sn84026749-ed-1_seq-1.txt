OF
Republican Nominee Will Put
End to Hints of German
American Candidacy.
IMPUTATION IS UNPATRIOTIC
NEW YORK, June 15. The
first thing Charles E. Hughes will
do after he is formally notified of
his nomination by the notification
committee of the Republican na
tional committee will bo to put
an end to the insinuation that he
is the candidate of the German
Americans.
He will do this with a straight
from-the-shoulder declaration that
he is an American candidate,
neither pro-German nor pro-ally,
and that for any one to circulate
the impression that he is anything
but an American candidate is not
only doing him a grave injustice,
but is unpatriotic.
HOLDING SELF IN CHECK.
This Information was obtained at the
Hughes headquarters, In tho Hotel
Astor. Hughes hlmsoir grimly rerused
to comment on tho various statements
In some newspapers attacking him for
being the favored candidate of the
hyphenates.
Tho anti-hyphen address of President
Wilson yesterday failed to disturb the
ptacld standing on that question which
Hughes has maintained since his
nomination.
Hughes will slip out or New York to
morrow to be away over Hunday, re
turning Monday morning to continue his
work -preliminary to the real cam
paign. He has not yet said whether it
will be a front porch campaign or a
campaign bf many observation car
speeches. Impression prevails, however,
that ho will make at least one country'
wide tour.
Continuation of the hard work of con
ferring constantly with persons who
want to do things for htm and tho

who want him to do things for them,

SINCE 1912
Brings American Eagle Into the
Convention and Plucks It as
Crowd Yells.
I TOLD YOU SO, THE ORDER
Speaker Takes Advantage of
His Prophecy of Victory of
Four Years Ago.
By THEODORE TILLER.
ST. LOUIS, June 14. The
American Eagle was brought into
the convention here today and its
feathers plucked, one at a time, by
the redoutable Ollie M. James, of
the grand old Blue Grass State.
Not since the days of Grover
Cleveland when the convention
orator of today was a gangling
mountain lad has the Democracy,
in office, been able to exult with
freedom and confidence.
Tho convention speeches for
many years past have had about
them a hollow ring, a surface in
dication of hops, but an undercur
rent of fighting against odds, a
plenitude of promise with a mental
reservation that it could never
come through and a show of en
thusiasm offset by the memories
of repeated defeats.
NO ECSTACIES THEN.
"When ho "keynoted" at Baltimore
four years ago. Senator Olllo James pre
dicted that "tho nomlneo of this con
vention will bo the next President of
the United States." The convention.
accustomed as it was to prophecies that
novor materialized, hoped It was so,
but did not go into ecstacles over the
prospect.
When the big Kentucklan spoke to
day, however, It was with tho thought
that his prophecy had come true, that
Woodrow Wilson was In tho White
House, and that Democratic wander
ings In tho land of political mako be
lieve had come to an end.
It was natural, therefore, that the
long arms of Olllo James should reach
upward and pluck a feather from tho
Eagle's tall. It was to be expected that
tho towering form of tho Senator from
Kentucky, dwarfing the clerks and tho
notables on the convontlon platform,
should lead on to delirious cheering a
thousand delegates and 10,000 Demo
crats, foregathered here to celebrate
four years In power and to anticipate
four years more.
As an orator Bonator James' today se
lected as permanent chairman of the
convention, Is among the best the party
affords. Ho can take an American flag

MOOSE WOULD GO
Three Leaders Ask Right to Ad
dress St. Louis Convention.
Names Are Withheld.
By JUDSON C. WELLIVER.
ST. ItoUlS, June IK. Telegrams have
been received in St. Louis from at least
three prominent and nationally known
leaders of the Progressive party, asking
for tho privilege of appearing before
the Democratic convention to tell the
story of the "Chicago betrayal" of tho
Progressives.
Tills statement was modo today by
a leading member of the Democratic
national committee. "There have been
somo really sonsatlonal things coins
on under the surface hero, without any
body knowing It," he added laughingly.
"Wo may put on n. show with ome
highly unexpected features before we'ro
done."
It was imposslblo to learn who are
the leading Progressives who want to
tell their Grievances from tho platform
of the Democratic convontlon. "That
would be a violation of confidence."
Insisted the committeeman when press
ed for information.
Uncertain About Invitation.
"Well, are they going to bo extend
ed the Invitation that thoy desire?" was
asked.
"I d(V't know even whethor they will
or not. ' was the reply. "You son. wo
thirst for the privllego of putting tho
firoceedlngs of this convention on a
oftler Intellectual and moral level than
wero thoso at Chicago, nut, of course.
It may provo Imposslblo to rofuse a
forum for gentlemen anxious to per
form a great patriotic service."
Nevertheless, somo mild doubts have
been Inspired as to the ardor of "lead
ing Progressives" nbout creating that
sort of a sensation. There Is n sus
picion that thoy may be gentlemen
who. before becoming Progressive,
were Democrats, and are now anxious
to smooth their way back into tho
fold of their flrst-lovo party.
Tho names of Raymond Robins and
Col. John M. Paiker were suggested
as representing ex-Democrats of this
type. Thcro Is Rome doubt whether ft

However, it Is known that somo
negotiations have been afoot between
Democratic managers and some of tho
Progressive figures, looking to an or

By PERRY ARNOLD.
ST. LOUIS, June 15. "Speed
up" methods were applied by
Democratic leaders today. When
the convention met at 11 o'clock,
it was with the fairly general un
derstanding that efforts will be
made to'adjourn .the conclave sine
die not later than tomorrow even
ing, instead of Saturday, as at
first planned.
The session which began at 11
is to be devoted entirely to ora
tory, with Permanent Chairman
Ollie M. James, the secondary
"keynoter" as the main spell
binder. Then, if the leaders' plans
carry, the convention is to adjourn
until tonight, when the resolutions
committee is expected to submit
the platform and the convention
to ratify this declaration of prin
ciples. Tomorrow, bright and
early, the Democrats plan to be

LATE IN ASSEMBLING.
As yestorday, the crowd was lato In
assembling. At 11 o'clock tho time set
for meeting thoro wore hardly 1.000
people In the hall, and only a handful
of delegates.

oVokcd a real demonstration, which
continued with cheers nnd applause for
more than a full minute.
Temporary Chairman Olynn's gavel

at 11:19. Olynn was greeted with yells
and prolonged applause.
Hy this time tho hall was fairly well
filled, several hundred seats In the gal
leries being the only vncant ones visible.

passion for rervlco shall supplant lust
of office; strong men whose sympathies
shall bo as broad as humanity."
Hall Stuffy and Sticky.
Tho hall was stuffy and sticky from
heat. Fans sold Ilka hot cakes and
most of the delegates and male spec
tators peeled off their coats.
Josoph 13, Dell, of Indiana, was rec
ognized by tho chair to make format
report for tho committee on creden
tials. The crowd fanned and perspir

routine document, conveying roporta
of the committee's decision on con

Tho report was adopted without de
