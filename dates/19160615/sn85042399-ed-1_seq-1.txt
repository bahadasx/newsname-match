personally became interested in the lot Ashland means. Five men from
movement last August and came here
last September, and within a few days
induced Bishop C. W. Nibley and 0.
C. Beebe of this city to assist him in
. financing the factory now being built
at Grants Pass. ,
"To carry out this purpose, the
Oregon-Utah Sugar Company was or-
ganized on September 28, 1915, and
Mr. Sanders became its first presi -
dent. Shortly thereafter Bishop C.
W. Nibley consented to become presi-
dent and Mr. Sanders wag made vice-
president and general manager;
Alexander Nibley, secretary; O. C.
Beebe, treasurer. After organization ( Mr. H. 0. Purucker. Ashland, Ore.
contracts for the growing of beets. Dear Sir: Answering yours of the
were entered into by the farmers and I 7th Inst., regarding the accommoda
arrangements then were made to ob-Jtions of the crowd, will Say that the
tain the necessary seed. Sufficient
contracts for the growing of beets to
warrant going ahead were obtained
about the latter part of December J
and the company proceeded with the
business of financing the construc
tion of a COfT-lOB tfdgar wofk, .
"The plan adopted last December
for the financing of the company was
that of issuing a $50,000 bond issue,
which bonds were shortly thereafter
underwritten by over twenty capital
ists of Salt Lake CltyTTfovo and
Granta Pass.
"During the latter part f Janu.
ary the entire bond Issue was resold
by the underwriters to a bond house
and the capital stock of the company
was increased from $100,000 to
$200,000 and the underwriters were
allowed to subscribe for the increased
capital stock. The first $100,000 cap
ital was' subscribed by Messrs. Nib
ley, Sanders and Beebe.
"Immediately thereafter a contract
was let for th erection of a 600-ton
leugar factory at Grants Pass, since
which time the construction baa pro
ceeded uninterrupted and the factory
will be completed by September 1 to
handle this year's crop, which already
has been planted and said to be in a
splendid, condition. -
"Mr. Sanders says that the citizens
Oregon and the people of the
Rogue River Valley will welcome the
advent of the Utah-Idaho Sugar Cony
pany in that country, and that it will
mean a great deal to Its 'future de
velopment to have such strong finan
cial interests identified with an Ore
gon enterprise.
"The organizers and stockholders
of the Oregon-Utah Sugar Company
have made profits ranging from 250
to 800 per cent on their Investments;
the underwriters in a period of four
months have made nearly 100 per
cent profit, and the bond house, in
the same period, made from 2 to 5
points profit on the bonds sold by
them.
"Mr. Sanders says further that the
present Indications are that the Ore
gon field will support several sugar
factories, and it is a matter of vast
importance that the development of
this (territory be in the hands of a
strong institution like the Utah-Idaho
Sugar Company, which company has
a large amount of liquid assets and is i
able to build one or more sugar fac
tories without issuing any additional
securities."

For July Visitors
. the committee are now canvassing
the city listing every available room.
A deal is being negotiated for the
purchase of one thousand cots whloh
I will either be 6oId at the wholesale
I price of $1.25 or rented for 25 cents
' a day to citizens. H. O. Purucker of
j the committee wrote to a friend who
is connected with the Pendleton
! Roundup, inquiring concerning the
'methods pursued in that city during
j their Roundup In handling the
crowds. The following reply was
received:
Pendleton, Ore., June 9, 1916.
Pendleton Roundup purchased the
cots which they have outright. They
rent these cots out to the people of
the city for 25 cents per day and
they have to take them for three
days. The Roundup has the accom
modation headquarters and people
go ttsre for rooms. They have the
people listed to whom they have rent-1
ed the cots and send the Inquiries' to
the people hating the' cOts." Also they
request the people, of Pendleton,
through the local papers, to phone
in the A headquarters if they have
any rooms to rent and also list these,
for the visiting public.
It is a large task to handle a crowd
.In a small town and It can only be
done with the co-operation of your
people of Ashland. They MUST throw
their homes open to the public. That
Is one of the great features which go
to make our show such a success
here. Our people do. their part.
' And another point that is as im
portant a factor, If not more so, is,
ask, plead, beg and INSIST thai the
people of Ashland do not "hold np"
the visiting public, if they do, you
will get the worst name and it will
be hard to rectify It. Set a price on
a room for one person, for twd, and
the price per cot, the price for a sin
gle bed, a double bed, and advertise
this in your local papers. Even re
quest your hotels not to hold people
Up. Every one Is Inclined to "get
the money" at a time like this, and
it is up to the association to see that
they don't rob people. The people of
Ashland should entertain the thought
of boosting their town, and the fact
that people will come again next year
If they are treated right.
Also Tmight state at this time that
our Roundup posts prices in the
grandstands, etc., what to pay for
refreshments and thus keep the peo
ple from being held UP again.
Any information 1 can give you
along this line will give me pleasure,
for I wish to see Ashland make a
success of the show.
Very truly yours,
CARL POWER.

Record Warmth
Brings Crowds
The thermometer registered 95
degrees above zero in Ashland yes
terday, one of the hottest June days
for several years. At the same time
Medford was sweltering with the
thermometer' Zt the 100 mark. Ash-
land park Is the most popular and
the iG6lest place in the valley. - The
crowd at the Wednesday night band
concert . was the largest evening
crowd which has yet visited the park.
Indicative of the possibilities of Ash
land weather is the fact that the
thermometer drops down to around
45 nightly and on last Thursday got
down to 32, which ( Is another June
record. The universal wish is that it
will stay warm until after the July
celebration, since it is during really
hot weather that Ashland can offer
the greatest attractions with her doz
ens of acres of shady park which is,
kept several degrees cooler than the
rest of the valley by the snow waters
of Ashland creek.
Roy Davis Receives
Deputy Clerkship

cases.
Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Ashcraft and
son Lynn D. have moved up from
Medford and are occupying the Chat
tin bungalow on Hargadlne street.
Mr. Ashcraft is one of the Interurban
drivers, and summer schedules have
made keeping one of the big gray
cars over night in Ashland the best
method for handling the Immense
crowds which visit Ashland from
down the valley.
H. F, Davidson, one of the most
extensive fruit operators in the north
west,, with headquarters at Hood
River, and S. B. Moomaw of London,
representing the North Pacific Fruit

termine whether B. R. Greer shall or
shall not be recalled from the springs

appears elsewhere In this issue. The
election date is set for Monday, June
26, and the polls will be open from
9 o'clock In the morning until 6 in
the evening on that day. Those who
are behind the recall petition which
was filed last week are making an
active campaign to turn out every
vote possible to recall Mr. Greer and
a lively Interest Is apparent in the
election. The largest vote wh'ch has
been turned out in the city in the
past two years is expected.
Candidates for the office of springs
water commissioner of the city to
take office on the commission In case
Mr. Greer Is recalled may be noml-.
nated by the filing of a petition with
twenty-five names attached. It is
rumored that II. G. Enders' name will
appear on the ballots.
All qualified electors who have re
sided thirty days In the city and ten
days In the ward Immediately preced
ing the election are entitled to vote
In their respective wards. The poll
ing places are outlined In the election
call; Following is Greer's statement
as required by law:
"The official acts of the springs
water commission have all been mat
ters of prompt and wide publicity, as
required by the city charter amend
ment creating the commission and
defining its duties.
"I have done my best In the admin
istration of my o'Nce and have
worked with an eye single to the best
Interests of the city. The work
shows for Itself. I rely upon the re
sults achieved.
"Before the work was done the
Smith, Emery & Company contract
was submitted to a vote of the people
of Ashland and was ratified at an
election held on the 3rd day of May,
1914, by a large majority. Relying
upon that approval, the springs wa
ter commission proceeded to carry
out the contract as ratified.
"Section 8 of the charter amend
ment creating the springs water com
mission provided that the commission
shall publish an itemized statement
of all expenditures "and every Item
thereof." This the commission did
at the same rate paid by the city of
Ashland for like notices,
"The 50,000 booklets complained
of by the petitroners were printed by
the Ashland Printing Company for
$600. The net profit on the Job to
the Tld'ngs was $62, less than is cus
tomary on commercial Jobs of the
kind."

Antarctic Pictures
At Chautauqua
Stories of privation, struggles and
want met with heroism always takes
hold of the Imagination. Tales of
exciting adventure enchain the at
tent'on and thrill the hearers.
Of all the tales in recent years
of heroism and tourapoous purpose)
and lonely death, the story of Capt.
Scott has riveted the attention ot
all people who have heard that wlerd
tale. If Scott had lived, what a
tale ho could have told! Yet thcra
is a story of another Englishman, Sir
Douglas Mason, who went through
Just such adventures as did Scott
and yet lived to tell the story to men
who sat content and warm by their
own firesides, reading with chilled
spine of the adventures of this In
trepid explorer.
Mawson ca.'iie back, from the land
of Ice and snow with a story more
gripping than the tales of the Ara
bian Nights, and more profusely il
lustrated than any travelogue leo
ture. He vivifies his own statements
with moving pictures secured under
tho most hazardous circumstances,
preserved through 27 months of win
ter weather and brought back to civ
ilization for exhibition. These mov
I?B are sa'd to be the most costly
of any ever secured. Twenty thous
and feet of film were made and from
this six reels of the choicest parts
were prepared for exhibition.
These pictures were secured 10,
(100 miles from America and 2,00ft
miles from the nearest human habi
tation in a land ucver before seou
by the eye of man. Deep sea crea
tures never before seen were photo
graphed. A perfect picture was so
cured of the windiest spot on earth
Adella Land where the wind has
attained tb,e velocity of 216 mllos an
hour. The largest Icebergs were also
photographed.
And in these pictures of this frozen
uninhabited land there Is humor.
The penguin is more humorous than
the monkey and a million of these
were photographed in a single rook
ery. The penguin Is the originator
of the famous Charlie Chaplin walk.
Photographically the pictures ara
the most perfect ever taken on a
similar expedition. The expedition
which secured them was the largest
In the history of exploration. It was
composed of 66 people and cost over
$300,000. The expedition covered a
period of 27 months.
For real movie thrills the Mawson
pictures are bard to beat, and best
of all they are not fictitious, but
true. And when these movies ara
presented at the Chautauqua and the
story told by Dr. Hunsberger of this
most unusual expedition, it will be am
innovation for Chautauqua, but oner
that will be well received. Evening
of July 13. .
