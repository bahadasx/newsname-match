Mr. Frank Budack, sheriff of
Richland county spent the fore
part of the week among the au
toists and citizens of this city
signing them up for a trip to Lid
gerwood on the 22.nd of this
month.
Lidgerwood is entertaining the
old settlers of this county on the
21st and 22nd of this month, and
the B-W. base ball team also
plays the winner of the Milnor
Hankinson ball teams on the
twenty second. Lidgerwood has
always acorded the fair manage
ment a hearty cooperation by be
ing in attendance at least one day
of the fair. This has always been
one of the biggest days of the
Richland County Fair. It is no
more than fitting that the Citi
zens of Wahpeton should do like
wise and accord the Lidgerwood
people who have gone to a heavy
expense in entertaining the Old
Settlors and we should do our part
to make it a financial success as
well as to show the old settlers
that we appreciate what they have
done for this county and its citi
zens.
About eighty cars will be in line
for that day and if Sheriff Budack
has not called upon you, and you
would like to join in the proces
sion, then call upon him and sign
up for the trip, you will be more
than welcome. The more the mer
rier. The city band is also going
and the people of this city espec
ially know that the old settlers
are going to hear some splendid
music.
Don't forget the date. .June 22,

A NEW OUTLET FOR GRAIN
Last Monday E. H. N'obe, Nor
way's Consul representing the
Norwegian government called at
the St. Paul office of the Equity
Society in company with Erick
Hammer, Secretary of the Nor
wegian Food Commission to make
arrangements for purchasing
grain direct from the producers
through their own selling agency
This is certainly a long step in
the right direction. Whenever the
farmers get in a position to sell
their own grain to the foreign
governments for just what it is
worth less the cost of transporta
tion, they will have their market
ing problem solved.
Both Mr. Nohe. the Consul anil
Mr. Hammer, Secretary of the
Food Commission were very en
thusiastic over purchasing wheat
direct from the producers through
their own selling agency. Mr.
Hammer will return to Norway
soon to report the results of his
mission here.

THE WAHPETON TIMES
WAHPETON, RICHLAND COUNTY, NORTH DAKOTA, THURSDAY JUNE 15th, 1916
Wahpeton may well take pride
in possessing genuine musical
talent and superior music teach
ers. The recital given last Friday
evening at the Congregational
Church by the pupils of the Wah
peton JJonservatory of Music
evinced the presence of both the
quantities named. The students
represented were ?.iiss Olivia Ed
elbrock, pianist, Miss Thelma Ed
elbrock, violinist, Mr. J. W. Per
kins, baritone and Mr. Rudolph
Gilles, baritone.
The special excellence of stud
ent musicianship and the quality
or the program materials th«
works of the best, composers
(speaking chronologically) from
Beethoven to Moskowski attest
the high ideals and careful meth
ods of their teachers, Miss Mar
guerite Baker, Miss Nina Bard
well and Mr Olaf Henrikso.ii.
Miss Edelbrock and her sister,
Thelma, the young violinist, who
occupied the principal positions
on the program, are charming
girls whose general bearing be
speaks the careful training of a
good mother as well as that of
good music teachers. Both are
endowed with tlift same musical
spirit and differ most in the choice
of means of expression. Thelma
has a truly remarkable lone for
one so young. It is full and true,
and except for a viDrato too slow
ly executed, compares favorably
with that of good violinists of
twice her age. Olivia, has on the
other hand, delicacy and greater
facility of execution.
From aiming the fourteen com
positions which figured on the
program, the following are men

Soore of 3 to 0
What was termed one of the
best ball games ever played on
the Milnor diamond was staged
in that city last Friday when the
local team of the little twins jour
neyed to Milnor and met the fast
team of that place. The local boys
lost out by the score of 1 to 0. An
error by Ripperton in the first
inning with two out and a man on
third was the cause of Milnor
scoring the one run they did. Af
ter the first inning the local team
played the better ball but the
breaks of the game were against
them and so the game ended with
Milnor an the long end of tin
close score of 1 to 0.

Wahpeton will tomorrow fitting

This is the first time that a thing
of this nature has been done. But
nevertheless it is timely. It will
show thi! students of this popular

ciizi-iis of Wahpeton appreciate
whatever they have done for them.
Every year a large number of
students come here to attend the
above mentioned school and while
in this city leave with us a certair
amount of worldly goods. Wahpe
ton has prospered to a certain ex
tent by these students patronizing
the local business places and it is
no more than right that we re
taliate and show these student*
that we appreciate whatever the
have done for us.
Mayor fligelman has requested
the business places ol this cit
to close from the hours of 11:3«
A. M. in the morning until at leas
2 p. m., and join in the big picnic

This is to remind you again
that. Summer School will com

ability lo instruct others. Hut, the
untried, untrained teacher espec
ially needs the work of the Sum
mer School.
In recommending leachers for
the schools of the county, other
things being equal, those who at
tend the Summer School and do
good work will be given the pre
ference.
If you have no license to teach
you may earn credits toward one
by attending. But it is a matter
of common knowledge that a cer
tificate is no guarantee of effic
iency as a teacher. It is not even
unquestionable evidence of need
ed scholarship, for much of the
poor instruction in our schools is
due to teachers' inadequate know
ledge of the subjects.
Call for efficient teaching ser
vice comes, not only from the
county superintendent, but from
.school officers and patrons—in
deed from wide-awake, devoted
teachers themselves. This call is
based on a demand for higher
standards of work in the schools
and it is up to those in the work
and those just entering it lo re
spond to those demands.
Very truly yours,
CHAS. HANSON.
