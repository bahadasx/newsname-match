Police Have New System,
Says Prosecutor A. J.
Merritt in Court.
SLEUTHS NOW GET ,
ENOUGH EVIDENCE
First Victim Sentenced To
Jail For 15 Days and
Fined $25.
The police have established, a se
cret service system by which much
information regarding the illicit, sale
of liquor has been procured, accord
ing to the statement made by Liquor
Prosecuting Attorney Albert J. Mer
ritt in the city "court today, when the
charge o'f . selling liquor without a
license was ' pressed against Hovag
uan Sorderian. an Armenian .restaur
ant keeper at 534 Water street. Sor
derian 'Was found guilty by Deputy
Judge Wilder and was fined $25 and
costs and sentenced ' to . 15 days in
jail. , The fine ' and costs amounted
to $45.45.

They f oundjthree men sitting, at a ta
ble with bottles of beer. In the ice

eight bottles of beer were found. ..
When the policemen entered the
place, Sorderian was detected by Po
liceman Burnes as he was throwing a
bottle of beer into a coal box.
In court, the ,.' three- men testified
that they had purchased the beer for
five cents a bottle but Sorderian "said
that' the beer was not "sold and he
kept It to give to his friends. He
alleged that the wine was not sold but
used in cooking certain dishes.
Attorney Merritt, In prosecuting the
case, said that in the past it has been
almost impossible to procure convic
tions in such cases as the police have
been unable to get admission to the
places f and that wKen their men do
gain entrance, they are not sold any
liquor. But, he added, the police
have developed a secret service by
which much important ' information
been obtained and especially was. this
so in the case of Sorderian. r -
Sorderian vwas arrested May 1 for
selling liquor without a license and
was fined $50, tout judgment was sus

CLERGYMEN TO
GIVE UP FIGHT ;
AGAINST CLUBS
Won't Carry Battle Against
' Liquor Organizations To
' Higher Court:
It is reported that the clergymen
and others who made such a long
fight against certain-'clubs which re-J
ceniiy oouuua liquor uuenses uy luo
simple scheme of changing the club
names, have decided not to carry the
legal struggle to the superior court.
The original intention was to appeal
to the superior court and then to the
hsupreme court if necessary. This pro
cedure would- be expensive. However,
and there was nobody willing to come
forward with the sinews of war. At
torney A. J. Merritt, who represented
the remonstrants, said today that he
had received no instructions to take
an appeal.
The remonstrants felt they had. been
unjustly dealt with because they re
ceived no notice that the clubs had
applied under new names for licenses.
Remonstrances had been filed against
such organizations as the Acorn, Ox
ford and East. End A. C. But when
the same clubs changed their names
to the Akron, Jonathan and Borough
R. C, and advertised their applica
tions in a newspaper printed in a
foreign language, the remonstrants
were taken unawares.

Disaster. :;
Eureka, Gal., June 15 Five
bodies have beeti recovered
from the steamer Bear, wreck
ed last night on Sugar Loaf
Rock. Twek- boatloads of sur
vivors ' have come ashore, one
boat is reported , trying to land
and the remaining passengers
and creWj are saTd ' Wbeaboard
the tug Relief.
One boat, carrying 20 per
sons, was reported - to have
landed at Point Mendocino.
Steamship officials said two
others were missing, "one from
which the bodies were lost and
another which was seen try
ing to make land. ,
Most of the' 182 persons on board the
liner were reported, safe aboard the
tug Rescue Which went out from here.
The fog which 'brought disaster to the
Bear continued impenetrable today.
The Bear, of the San Francisco &
Portland Steamship company, from
Portland, Ore., for San Francisco,
went ashore last night about 10
o'clock. Passengers and crew were
compelled to seek refuge in the ship's
lifeboats.
The order to abandon ship was given
and all on 'board got away safely! The
steamer went ashore during a thick
fog 'but -the sea was reported smooth
and assistance from -the nearest ports
made "all haste to the shipwrecked
company. ' ; ' ' .
The life saving (Station, at Eureka,
15 miles north : of the scene of - the
wreck, started out power lifeboat at
10:30 and at midnight the tug Relief
left for the scene of the wreck.
A radio message received early to
day reported that Captain L. N. No
pander, master of the Bear, had or
dered the ship abandoned about mid
night and, that all lifeboats ,had got
safely away from the ship and were
waiting in smooth water the arrival
of the rescue boats which, in addition
to 'the. battleship Oregon, the Eureka
lifehoat and the tug Relief, included,
the steamer irace Dollar.
The battleship Oregon and the
steamer Grace Dollar, which answer
ed the S.' O. S. calls of the stranded'
liner, have been patrolling" the vi
cinity of the wreck since early morn
ing. A tug and lifesaving crew from
this port are also at the, scene. k
YA thick fog lay over the water at
daybreak -and a heavy swell was run
ning. The Oregon arrived before
daybreak and played its big search
lights through the fog to no avail.
When the liner cradled in the rocks.
Captain Nopander did not send out
an S. O. S. call immediately, evi
dently believing he could clear his
boat. Apparently finding the steamer
tightly clamped he ordered the pas
sengers into the lifeboats.
' The Bear wfes leaking badly when
signs of breaking up. She carried a
cargo of 2700 tons.
Sugar Loaf Rock, which the Bear
struck, is the outermost pinnacle of a
reef that has caused - the destruction
of a dizen vessels Jn the last 20
years. Close by the' spot where the
Bear is supposed to have struck, the
steamer Southal was wrecked 10
years ago with a loss of many lives.

Gray declares his handling "of the
case has been open ( and above board
in every respect. It was not charged
that Attorney Gray tried to collect
any illegal fees but Johanna' H. G.
Kessler claimed he had been guilty
of unprofessional conduct in handling
certain phases of the case. The mat
ter is still in the hands of the griev

sertion in 1899. They were married
in 1899. - He wants the custody of

the papers in the suit. She was dis
satisfied because $110 had been paid

the stirring address of Senator Ollia M. James as permanent
chairman, delegates to the Democratic convention toda;
were anxious to get to the real business of the convention-
the renomination of President Woodrow Wilson and Vice
President Thomas R. Marshall. '
Indications this afternoon were that the -nominations
would be made tonight, under a revision of the rules made
on recommendation of the rules committee. The committee
was unanimous1 in favor of the change which met with
high favor among the delegates.
The platform buiMers were busy today."-
They had before them Presi
dent Wilson's "own draft'," in addition
to an avalanche of suggestions from
committeemen and others. r -
vThe sub-committee hoped" to have
its work completed for submission to
the committee . on resolutions to
night. Interest in the convention today
centered on the speech by Senator
James as permanent chairman. The
senator was cheered as he took the
platform and his stirring defense of
the Democratic administration pro
voked repeated demonstrations.
Eleven o'clock, ' the hour of the
Democratic convention to be in'order,
passed with the coliseum only partly
filled. Very few of the delegates
were in their seats and rione of the
leaders had arrived.-.
The band played the anti-hyphen
song, "Don't Bite the Hand That's
Feeding Tou," and a male quartet
sang the chorus. The crowd liked
it and cheered.

ization at a meeting meanwhile form
felly named Senator Ollie-M. James, of
Kentucky, as permanent chairman; J.
Bruce Kremer, of Montana, perman
ent secretary; E. E. Britton of North

William J. Bryan got his 'usual re
ception when he took his place in the
press stand. Delegates and galleries
joined in cheers and applause. A
soloist in the bandstand sang "Wake
Up America," the preparedness song,
as Mr. Bryan was taking his seat.
While the convention waited the
Word went around that the rules com
mittee would recommend that the
nominations be made tonight. The
convention managers and officers of
the national committee declared their
confidence that the' plan would go
through. It was welcome ' news to
many of the. delegates who have not
relished remaining until Saturday.
The plan to adopt the platform after
the nominations have been made, as
was done in Baltimore four years ago,
Was counted on to fulfill the promises
of managers to the city of St. Louis
for a four days convention. i
- The boom of Congressman Sullivan
for vice-president, started by friends
of the Illinois leader in Chicago, was
deflated today and at a caucus of the
Illinois delegation a resolution was
Ipassed that in the event Vice-Presi
dent JVLarsnan ceaseu iu t t- a. ca.uui
date, Sullivan's friends would again
become active to secure him' the nomi
nation. Mr. Sullivan thanked the
delegation and said he had never been
a candidate.
When Temporary Chairman Glynn
called the convention to order the
delegates gave him a rousing recep
tion. Archbishop John J. Glennon, of St.
Louis then offered the following
prayer:
"Omnipotent, Eternal God, master,
of natiensV and of men, we humbly
beseech Thy protection and benedic
tion. Thou has made us in thine own
Image and likeness, drive., from our
hearts the blood-lust and barbarism
of the Jungle; preserve our nation in
peace peace rooted in honor. Our
trust in Thee is absolute, grant that
our trust in Thy people, whatever
their nation, may not be in vain. Give
us strength to do bravely, sanity to
act wisely, justice to exercise towards
all. Give us leaders in whom the
passion of service, shall supplant the
lust of office, strong men and true.
whose patriotism shall be as brod as
America whose sympathies shall be
as deep as humanity. Drive from
their hearts all narrowness of sect, ,ojt
caste or tradition, or locality.
"Blessed then and prosper ug will
this nation be, if they who lead shall
live pure, speak true, right wrong'
remember thy kingship and serve thy
people."
The delegates joined with the Ar
bishop in the Lord's prayer. '
The credentials committee then re
ported on ,th delegation tests from
Washington, D. C; Porto Rico and
Hawaii. The delegates from the
District of Columbia and Hawaii were
recognized as placed on the rolls by
the national committee: Porto Rico
