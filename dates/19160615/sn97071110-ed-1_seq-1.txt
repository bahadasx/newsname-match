For Tomorrow
We have turned up the whole store to meet the
demands of men and young men who insist on get
ting the most their money can buy.
We're looking for the fellow who is supercriti
cal, who knows goods clothes when he sees them
and refuses to purchase anything anywhere that
isn't guaranteed to satisfy him absolutely.
To carry out this program we offer clothing
from a house with a nation-wide reputation for
superiority. Superiority of style, fabric, tailoring,
fit and finish, second to none.
Kuppenheimer Clothes
$18 $20 $25
Fine Suits at $15
There are, we know, a host of men and young
men who do not care to spend more than $15 for
suits. To them we offer the finest suits at $15 ever
shown in Hood River. We do not claim them to be
$18 to $20 values. We don't sell them on bargain
basis.
Everyone asks this question many
times daily.
We are all dependent upon the time.
Our lives are .regulated by our
watches.
The lack of a watch is a big handi
cap to both men and women.
Therefore, why try to get along
without one?
Let us show you a good watch; one
you can depend upon. We can suit
both your taste and your pocketbook.

Jeweler
While at the office of a prominent at
torney in Hood River one day last week,
Joe D. Thomison was accused of being our
press agent; rather hard on Joe, but he is
not guilty. We hold regular "skull prac
tice" at our farm and those little ads are
part of those exercises. In writing those
ads, we are trying to set before the mer
chant and consumer, first of all that Hood
River can grow all kinds of fruit and vege
tables, grow them to perfection and put
them on the market in due time; that it's to
interest of any community to keep their
money at home and not import such stuff -as
may be produced at home a little better.
It is our aim to take chances and force
our vegetables by all means and knowledge
at our commands, but we cannot control
the season; however, our vegetables finally,
put on the market are "Non Pareil".
We just ask
you to see 'em
with the
usual run of
clothes at this
price to con
vinceyourself that a ''Fif
teen" is some
suit for the
money.

BERRY HARVEST
IS UNDER WAY
CLARK SEEDLING BEST FOR QUALITY
Variety Propagated at ML Tabor Now
Planted on 1,000 Acres in Mid
Columbia District
Some men and women cannot eat
strawberries at least if they do, they
are victims of a discomforting rash,
produced by effects of ingredients of
the fruit on peculiar constitutions.
Fortunately this number of the DODura-
tion is negligible. A box of luscious,
red Clark Seedlings is tempting, and
the mere sight of them to human eyes
Brings a universal and irrestibile im
pulse. It's a strong willed person who
can refuse the appeal of a box of ber
ries, especially of Clark Seedlings, and
in these days of Junetime, berry har
vest days, when thousands of crates of
the delicious Seedlings are finding their
way from field to market, just a very,
very few say nay. The remainder of
that negligible portion of the poplation
go right ahead and eat their (ill, and
then, perhaps, wish that modern day
society had a Duke of Argyle to raise
countless scratching posts.
Here strawberries are as old as the
ages. Historians have found them the
food of royalty and peasant alike, and
writers of fiction have delighted in
drawing pen pictures of heroines break
fasting on strawberries and eream.
Every uncultivated tract of every val
ley floor in the mid-Columbia region
will be found today carpeted with thou
sands of the plants of wild strawber
ries.
1 But the Clark Seedling mention the
name in circles of commission mer
chants is scarcely older than the fruit
industry of the Hood Kiver valley and
contiguous fruit districts. The berry is
a native product of Oregon. Some 40
years ago the parent plant was propa
gated by a man whose name the variety
bears, in the Mount Tabor district. In
1879 the first Clark Seedlinga were
brought to the Hood River valley by B.
Warren, an Oregon pioneer, now de
ceased. Mr. Warren's widow resides
in Portland. T. K. Coon, a pioneer
schoolmaster and first teacher of Fred
eric Homer Batch, author of "The
Bridge of the Gods," according to rec
ords, planted the first commercial tract
of Clark Seedlings in the Bood River
valley. The fruit today is produced in
commercial quantities in the Hood Riv
er and Underwood and White Salmon,
Wash., districts. The approximate
acreage of berries in the three districts
is as follows: Underwood, 40; White
Salmon. 320: Hood River, 750. The
crop of this season will reach well
towards 120.000 crates or more than
175 carloads.
Other varieties of strawberries are
more prolific than Clark Seedlings but
none contain more flavor and no berries
have won such recognition for shipping
qualities. " Clark Seedlings have been
shipped safely as far east as Chicago,
and the larger precentage of the local
crop is distributed throughout Montana
and other Inter-mountain sections and
the Dakotas. As in the case of the
apple crops the strawberries are han
dled by the cooperative sales agencies.
More than 95 per cent ol the fruit of
the three districts is sold by the Apple
Growers Association with which the
White Salmon Growers Association, the
sales agency covering the two Washing
ton districts.bas for the past two years
maintained a joint agreement.
Because of the topography of the two
districts, the latitude of the fields grad
ually rising from 200 and 300 feet along
the lower levels of the Columbia to
1500 and 2000 feet in the more remote
sections of the valleys, the harvesting
Reason of the mid-Colubmia berries ex
tends over a comparatively longer peri
od than any other fruit district.
Strawberry harvest is now at its
height, and more than 1,000 pickers
from outside communities are engaged
in the work. Except for about 100
Indians the pickers are made up largely
from families of Portland and Willam
ette Valley cities. It is estimated that
as many as 500 members of growers
families also help pick and pack the
fruit.
Berry harvest scenes are interesting.
Every grove in portions of the West
Side of the Hood River valley and those
communities of White Salmon and Un
derwood sections best adapted to berries
has its company of campers. Spring
ter rains are usually over by tbe time
strawberries are ripening, and the har
vest hands live in tents, indeed, in
addition to tbe profit derived, the ber
ry pickers consider tbe several weeks
spent in tbe fields as an outing, a vaca
tion for the entire family.
The baby coos and chatters in an im
provised crib in the open air, and the
camp visitor may even see the family
dog or cat Some of the best pickers
are small children.
Indians come to the berry fields year
after year from the Warm Springs and
Yakima reservations and from Celilo.
Growers declare the Redmen to be
among tbe best and cleanest pickers.
Some of the largest berry tracts in tbe
Hood River distict are now owned by
Japanese. More than 50 Japanese
ranchers are members of the Apple
Growers Association. The Nipponese
always endeavor to secure Indian pick
ers. Tbe numbers of Indian berry harvest
ers have been dwindling for some un
known reason during the past several
years. In former years the tribesmen
visited the valley 500 strong. The In
dian dances, given in a huge fir and
pine grove west of the city, were an
event of berry harvest time. The last
big dance was given in 1911. By some
it is declared that tbe Indiana have
resented the development of these bits
of forest that have been left by orch
ardiats and that their dances have been
discontinued for lack of a place to give
them. However, on this season
spokesmen of Yakima and Celilo tribes
have negotiated with the management
of the ball park and have planned to
give exhibition danees. The dances of
the olden days, when at sunset tbe torn
toms could be heard beating in the
Weat Side grqyea, were given appar
ently for pleasure. Indeed, the Indians
seemed to resent tbe intrusion of tbe
hundreds of spectators. But the Red
man baa grown commercial, and the
oroDOsed terosichorean exhibiliona will
be made in the hope of liberal gate re
ceipts.
While the -Indian berry harvesters
cling to the costumes tbey have de
lighted to wear for so long, they make
use of many of the comforts of tbe
modern day. It is not an unusual sight
to see an" Indian mother rolling her
new born babe out to the strawberry
field in a handsome wicker buggy. The
little vehicle with its sleeping occupant
ia wheeled along as the mother pro
gresses wun ner earner down tbe row
of vines, stopping her work at intervals
to bend over with bared breasts and
feed ' tbe potential brave awakened by
the pangs of hunger.
Until this year most of the visiting
berry pickers have come to Hood River
by Columbia steamers. Formerly the
river boats would be crowded with
families, tbeir wagons and teams, en
route to the berry fields. Boat traffic
this season has been light; for the
Journey hss been made by way of the
lolumbia River highway. Scores of
wagons have arrived in a aingle day,
and it has been learned that no small
percentage of the berry hands rid in
automobiles. At least a score of fami
lies, seeking work in the berry fields,
have traveled up from Portland over
the Columbia River highway this sea
son in their own motor ears.
Strswberries are handled with the
utmost care. The fruit must be nicked
just at the right time and packed care
fully, even a Clark seedling, if it is
expected to make a long journey with
out deterioration.
In the packing shed of every grower
member of the Apple Growers Associa
tion is posted the following rules:
Extra fancy Strawberriear This
grade shall consist of all perfect ber
ries, Clark Seedling variety, picked at
the proper stage of ripeness for ship
ping. All berries must show at least
three-fourths red. Nothing smaller
than 6Jx5J (meaning berries not less
than of an inch in diameter) and no
stemless berries in this grade. Pack
each cup firmly, without bruising the
fruit, so that there will be no settling
of the berries.
Picking : Berries must not be picked
when there ia moisture on the vines.
Berries must be picked riper in oool
weather than in warm. Pickers must
not be permitted to hold several berries
in the hand at the same time. Pick all
berries with stems I of an inch long.
Berries off the stems decay quickly and
cannot be accepted In this grade. Do
not pick green berries this is reck
less waate. Do not step or kneel on
the vines. Study specifics tions care
fully. Do not allow carriers or crates
to stand in the sun or wind; the wind
is more damaging than the sun. The
strawberry is probably our most deli
cate, most perishable fruit and must
be handled with the best of care from
the time of picking until it reaches the
consumer.
Pscking: Berries brought in from
the field by the picker must be emptied
by the packer on a sieve of cloth, to
allow the dust to fall away from them.
Face the top of the cup with berriea as
uniform in size as possible, placed in
rows across the top aecoridng to their
size. Fill the eups so that the top
layer will show of an inch above the
top of the cup. In no event will ber
ries be accepted if smaller than 1 of an
inch in diameter.or in which more than
15 per cent of the berries below the
facing are smaller than the facing or
ia any way inferior. Be sure that
when tbe covers are placed on the
crates they fit closely to the top layer
of berries, but in no event snould the
covers press on the berries In such wsy
as to bruise them. If the cover eannot
be placed on the crate without bruising
the berries, cleata roust be nailed to
the top of the boxes unde the cover, or
the berries repacked.
Hauling and Marketing: Haul only
on wagons with good springs and keep
the fruit covered with a canyas to keep
out the dust. The state law requires
the grower's name and location where
berries were grown on each and every
case of fruit placed on tbe market.
Strawberry picking begina as soon as
morning dews have vanished. It usu
ally continues throughout tbe day, the
berries being packed as fast aa brought
in from the vines. The fruit begins to
arrive at chipping warehouses about
four o'clock in the afternoon, and from
that time until eight a atring of wag
ons ia lined up, sometime 60 in num
ber, the growers awaiting their turns
to unload the precious freight. This
four hour period of the day is the busi
est of all the year in the fruit ware
houses. As fast as inspectors have
(tone through the crates they are hus
tled into cold rooms and thence into
express refrigerator cars. Strawber
ries travel tint class on passenger
trains. The eastbound passenger trains,
which carry the most of the local berry
crop, pass through Hood River at 8.50
snd 9.05 respectively. The crates of
fruit are not just thrown into any
shaped heaps in the cars. They must
be nailed together, and the connecting
supports are fastened to the sides of
the car. Often the men, engaged in
preparing a car will not be through
with their work when the switch en
gine comes for it. Despite tbe shunt
ing of the engine they keep right on
with their task. If the crates are in
shape at the time the train is pulling
from the local yards tbey grasp tbeir
hammer and nail boxes, fasten the
ventillator doors.as tbey stand on rods,
and jump to the ground. If not, they
proceed with the train to the nearest
ststion to the east.
Growing strawberries ia a profitable
business, and has been the means of
enabling many orchardista in develop
ing their tracts and securing an income
during the six fears it takes apple
trees to come into bearing. . Berry
tracts yield an average of 110 crates to
the acre. Tbe average returns will run
at some figure between $100 and $150
per acre. In exceptional cases straw
tarry growers have made aa much as
$300 per acre from their tracts.
A rivalry is springing up between the
growers or different local districts.
Some are endeavoring by careful selec
tion of mother plants to increase tbe
productivity oi the Clark seedling, and
others give careful attention to the
quantity of tbe fruit. The growers of
tbe Dee Flat district bave begun a
campaign this year to determine what
the ultimate consumer thinks of his
product, and in the bottom of each ber
ry box is placed a cardboard slip, ask
ing condition of fruit on arrival, date
consumed, price, city, state and gener
al remarks.
"It is our mutual advantage," states
the slip, "that you should oe entirely
satisfied with these Hoed River valley
strawberries. Yourxrepliea to the fol
lowing questions andany remarks you
may care to make will be greatly ap
preciated.

Stone. Tbe members of the board of
directors of Agency will bold a meeting
netx Saturday, when proposed amend

In reply to an urgent reaueat as to
the position of the Apple Growers As
sociation toward the Fruit Growers'
Agency, Incorporated, we have hereto
fore been unable to consistently give
to the press any definite information as
to the conference between our Associa
tion, representatives of the Fruit
Growers' Agency and the U. S. gov
ernment, held at Hood River on Friday
ano saiuraay last, we are, however,
now at liberty to furnish you with this
information and we can comply with
your desires in no better way than to
quote from the correspondence. We
quote from letter of the Apple Grow
era Association to the Fruit Growers'
Agency, Incorporated:
"Alter considering your bvlaws care
fully, we bave made and enclose herein
a few suggested changes that we re
gard of the most importance. We take
thiB opportunity of assuring you that
in the suggested changes you have re
ceived the experience of our growers
wnicn nave been made witb tbe fact in
view that we are to become a part of
your organization and have made these
suggested changes with the view of
laying the foundation for a stronger
and more permanent organisation and
we believe you will find it much easier
to secure members with these changes
than you could otherwise have done.
"With our organization we have
learned the lesson that a successful co
operative organization cannot succeed
by holding its members against tbeir
will, but that the greatest success
comes from so organizing and so con
ducting such organization that the
greatest punishment to members is to
expel them from your organization.
"II there la any suggested change in
these bylaws that you think is not for
the best interests of the Fruit Growers
Agency and for the best interests of
the fruit growers of the Northwest, we
wish to have you communicate with us
and we will point out to you wherein
I I 1 I 111 I I .
wa oeueve aucn cnange win oe in toe
interest, not only of the agency, bat ef
every district jn tbe Northwest. If
such is not the case, then we have been
misled by the many years of experience
in this line of work to, which we are
heir.
'We bave concluded in order to in
sure success in this work and be of
benefit to you in assisting you to secure
enough tonnage to warrant success,
which we feel sure you can do, we be
lieve that not less than 75 per cent of
the tonnage and 75 per cent of the elig
ible active members of the organiza
tions located in the principal districts
of the Northwest should join your
agency.
'under these conditions we assure
you that our Board is ready to lend
their hearty support to this movement.
Before becoming binding on our organ
ization it would have to be submitted
to a meeting of our members, as we
have written you heretofore. You can,
however, rest assured that at such
meeting, if tbe conditions hereinbefore
mentioned are complied with.our Board
will recommend joining your agency."
We quote from the reply of tbe Fruit
Growers' Agency to the above corres
pondence :
"We bave read with great interest
botb your letter and the proposed
changes, and to say that we are pleased
is not expressing our reelings at all
adequately. We fully appreciate that
the experience of tbe members of your
organization will be of great value to
the Fruit Growera' Agency, and for
that reason particularly we are very
glad indeed to have the suggestions you
make. The changes you make are not
only acceptable to us, but we feel that
several of the changes you make are of
great importance and will, sb you say,
make it easier for us to secure mem
bers.
"Botb ourselves and the government
representative have gone over your
letter and the suggested changes, and
we feel that you have been eminently
fair to the Agency. We fully realize
that you have an orgamzaton to pro
tect and you would be remiss in your
duty if you did not do your utmost to
protect tbe Interests entrusted to you
to the best of your ability."
