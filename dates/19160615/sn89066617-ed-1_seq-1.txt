FINCH FAVORS
RIGHTEOUS.WAR
IN FLAG SPEECH
Is Better Than Unholy Peace,
Orator At Elk Services
Deelarei.
CALLS UPON U. S. TO
PROTECT CITIZENS
Honor of the Flag Is Up to You
and I, Says-Big Crowd
Attends.
Declaring that the United States
must protect American citizens "any
where the sun shines," former Judge
James A. Finch, of Fornfelt, yester
day afternoon said a "righteous war
is better than an unrighteous and un
holy peace" in his address at the Flag
Day exercises of the Elks Club.
The address wa$ delivered before a
crowd of more than TOO men, women
and children in the Courthouse park
late yesterday afternoon. It was the
closing feature of a program xf songs
and addresses in which both school
children and members of the Elks
lodge did homage to the American
flag.
"If the Government does not mean
protection of its citizens not only here,
but likewise abroad, it is not worthy
to survive. If it does not give protec
tion under any and all circumstances,
it is doomed to despair. If there is
one function of government, it is the
protection of life, liberty and prop
erty," Judge Finch said.
"I know no good man who is in
favor of war. But a righteous war is
better than an unrighteous and un
holy peace.
"The record that George Washing
ton made, however illustrious, will not
serve for us. Our future depends up
on ourselves and the way in which we
work out our own salvation.
"I trust our mothers shall not have
to do as the German and English and
French mothers are doing in giving up
their boys; but it is the spirit of loy
alty and devotion that saves a coun
try. I know our mothers will be as
brave as those.
"Let us re-consccrate our lives to
America to an undivided union,
strength of purpose, the upbuilding of
American institutions and new glories
for our flag."
Mr. Finch opened his address by
declaring that he believed Flag Day
will become a national day of tran
scendent importance, because, he said,
if we are to preserve our independence
we must inculcate into the minds of
the youth of the country the ideas of
Americanism in the broadest terms.
"What th flag means to the coming
generations is up to you and me. We
can not partake of the glory of the
past, but we, ourselves, must hand it
down clean and undefiled."
He said youth must be made to know !
that we are living in the greatest
country of the world, and opportuni
ties will be even greater if the people
will exercise their power of suffrage
universally.
He attacked the citizen who fails to
go to the polls to vote, as failing to
perform his duty, and said those citi
zens turn the institutions and govern
ment of the country over to interests
having axes to grind.
Judge Finch said the press is one
of the most potent factors in reflecting
as well as directing public opinion if
the influence of the business office
may be ruled away from the editorial
page. He said that when universal
exercise of the suffrage becomes real,'
the people will control in every de
partment of the government and the
Stars and Stripes will be brightest in
the world's diadem of national ban
ners. Mr. Finch closed his address with
two stanzas from a poem entitled "The
American Flag," as follows:
"Your flag and my flag, and how it
flies today
In your land and my land and half a
worldaway;
Rose red and blood red its stripes for
ever gleam,
Snow white and soul white, the good
forefathers' dream;
Sky blue and true blue with stars that
gleam aright;
The gloried guidon of the day. a shel
ter through the night

BOHNSACK "SINGED"
BUTSEES DEMOCRATS
Merchant Swamped With Tickets
To Convention, But Hotel
Man Plucks Him.
William H. Bohnsack Jr., the well
known merchant, returned from St.
Louis last night, where he attended
the opening session of the Democratic
National Convention, and gave the
hotel men an opportunity to "singe"
him, which they did..
Mr. Bohnsack decided suddenly that
he would like to see the Democrats in
action, obtained the address of Harry
E. Alexander, and wrote him a request
for a ticket -to the Coliseum. When
Mr. Bohnsack reached St. Louis and
got into the business dictrict, he met
a friend who had an extra ticket to
the convention and he invited the Cape
Girardeauan to accept it
"Sure thing," responded Mr. Bohn
sack. "That's exactly what I came to
St. Louis to get."
Having obtained the passport into
the convention hall, he set out for the
hotel where Mr. Alexander was regis
tered, to inform him that he would not
need the ticket he had requested. But
he missed the Cape Girardeau dele
gate, arriving at the hotel, the clerk
said, just a moment after Mr. Alexan
der had gone.
"I'm glad I saw my St. Louis friend
before I began trailing my Cape Gir
ardeau neighbor," remarked the mer
chant, as he strolled out of the hotel.
Just as Mr. Bohnsack stepped out
on the walk, he confronted another
friend. "Well, well, Bohnsack; just
the man I'm looking for. I have a sea
son pass to the convention and I have
been called out of the city. I want
you to take it and use it."
"Fine!" replied the fortunate Cape
Girardeauan. "I'm crazy to see that
convention."
The friend hurried to the station to
catch a train, and Mr. Bohnsack began
looking for some Cape man who was
ticketless. Failing to locate one, he
went to the station yesterday morning
to meet the Frisco from Gpe Girar
deau. Doctor Hope emerged into the
midway just as Mr. Bohnsack reached
the scene. They attended the meeting
together and enjoyed every minute of
their stay.
Mr. Bohnsack went to St. Louis ex
pecting to be plucked by the hotel men
and he was not disappointed. He
registered at the Terminal hotel and
paid $5 a day for a room that ordi
narily rented for $1.
"That hotel man just thought he
was overcharging me, but he didn't,"
said Mr. Bohnsack. "I took a bath
every time I could get to my room and
I shined my shoes with the face
towels. I never enjoyed myself more.
I witnessed the convention and heard
the speeches, which were excellent
I was told that 17,000 people were in
the convention hall ' and it was not
quite filled. It is surely a great meet-

PAUL PHELPS NOT
EXPECTED TO LIVE
Thebes Man Shot Self Through
Lung Bullet Passes
His Heart.
Paul Phelps, who shot himself at his
home in Thebes, 111., about 8:30 o'clock
Tuesday morning, last night was not
expected to live, according to informa
tion received here.
From the position of the bullet
wound it is believed the young man
attempted to shoot himself in the
heart The ball passed through the
left lung, just at the side of his heart.
He regained consciousness for the first
time yesterday morning, after the
shooting.
Young Phelps shot himself while in
a fit of despondency. He is 28 years
old and has been employed as a barber
at Thebes. He is a son of Dr. Phelps
of Thebes, and resides at his father's
home. It is understood that he is
married. Miss Ruby Phelps, his sis
ter, was a student at the Normal last
winter.
Last week, from Thursday to Fri
day, Phelps quit work and went on a
picnic at Rock Springs, a mile below
Thebes. On his return home he was
despondent. Tuesday evening be went
to his room and closed the door but
did not lock it.
His parents were downstairs, and a
short time after their son has retired
they heard a muffled report in his
room. Doctor Phelps ran to his son's
room and found him lying on the floor.
He was unconscious and the revolver
was clutched in his hand.
Dr. Bondurant of Cairo was sum
moned to Thebes to aid the father in
saving the young man's life. Yester
day morning when the son talked to
his father, he declared that he wants
to live. He has one brother.

DECLINES jOFFER
TO GO TO ENGLAND
F. C. Bair, Ten-Cent Store Man
ager, Don't Fancy U-Boat
Dodging.
That F. C. Bair, local manager of
the Wool worth Ten Cent store, was
offered an opportunity to go to Eng
land to engage in the ten-cent store
business and declined to leave the
Cape, became known last night.
The offer was extended to Mr. Bair
from the main offices of the Wool
worth concern in New York. Fifteen
young American store managers were
wanted to recruit the'stafF of store
managers in England.
The Englishmen who have been en
gaged in the ten-cent store business
have been taken out of the stores to
fight for "king and country," the let
ter to Mr. Bair pointed out, so that it
became necessary to obtain store man
agers from the United States.
The offer was made three weeks ago
when a call was sent out to several of
the store managers asking them if
they desired to go to England. The
proposition was an attractive offer
from a financial viewpoint, Mr. Bair
declared, and it meant the opening of
great possibilities for advancement in
the merchandising business there.
Mr. Bair said he was not anxious to
leave Cape Girardeau to take chances
on getting safely past the German
submarines, especially since the repu
tation of the "mighty" English fleet
has been somewhat lowered since the
affair at Skagger-Rak.
Mr. Mair came to the Cape two
years ago to open the local ten-cent
store and he has been its manager
since.

Special Disnatch to The Tribune.
London, June 14. Russian and Ger
man squadrons have clashed in the
Baltic, the Copenhagen correspondent
of the Exchange Telegraph cabled to
night. The Russians drove off the
Germans. It is reported that eight
1 armored German trawlers, one auxili-
i
ary cruiser and two destroyers were
convoying 14 German steamers when
thev were attacked sudder.lv by six
Russian destroyers and several sub
marines.
Kovel, r.ext to Leniberg the most
important railroad center back of the
Eastern Austria line, is now, with
Lemberg and Czernowitz in Bukowina,
I one of the immediate objectives of the
Russian drive. Its capture would
prove a serious embarrassment to the
lines of the Germans to ward Rifia, and
those of the Austrians to the south.
The Russians have approached Kovel
closest in the territory west of Lutsk.
Further indentation of the Austrian
line here would give them an oppor
tunity to gain their objective by both
a frontal attack from Rafalowka and a
I flanking from the south.
Czernowitz is still in the hands of
the Austrians, but its evacuation is
hourly expected. Russian cavalry has
aiready driven past it about 10 miles
to tnc north.
Special Dispatch to The Tribune.
Rome, June 11. The Italian fieet is

engagement apparently resulted from
an attempt of the Germans to land
reinforcements for Field Marshal von
Hindenburg's offensgive against the
Russians on the Riga-Dvink front.

reached London, but there arc two re
ports concerning the number of ships

IN KEYNOTE TALKS

Lauds President.
Special to The Tribune.
St Louis, June 14. Two keynote
speeches were the principal features
of the first session of the Democratic
National Convention here today. The
first, delivered by former Governor
Glynn of New York, paid a tribute to
the President for keeping the country
out of war, and the second, by William
Jennings Bryan, urged the Democrats
"to go out and catch the Bull Moose.
President Wilson has been asked to
come to St. Louis Friday afternoon
and accept the nomination. His man
agers say he will probably accept the
invitation, but his official decision will
be made early today. A record demon
stration will mark his visit here. At
the mention of the President's name
today the convention cheered lustily.
As the day wore on it became more
apparent that Vice-President Marshall
would again be made Woodrow Wi!-
! son's running mate. An effort is being
made to induce Governor Major of
Missouri ami Roger Sullivan of Illi
nois to withdraw in favor of Mr. Mar
shall.. But whether they do or do not,
the Indianan will be nominated with
out much opposition, according to the
leaders. President Wilson has ex
pressed a desire to have his running
mate of four years ago again placed
on the ticket and his wishes will bo
granted.
The final draft of the platform will
not be completed before tomorrow aft
ernoon, and possibly later. The per
manent organization will be effected
when the convention reassembles at IT
o'clock in the morning. United State
Senator Ollie James of Kentucky, who
was the permanent chairman of the
convention at Baltimore four years
ago, will be chosen to preside at the
meeting here. It was announced offi
cially tonight that the Kentuckian had
been selected for permanent chairman.
In the early part of his keynote
address Chairman Glynn defined in
the order of their importance the chief
steps in our foreign policy, which he
believes to be the more important
issue of the presidential campaign. He
said:
"What the people of the United
States must determine through their
suffrage is whether the course the
country has pursued through this
crucial period is to be continued;
whether the principles that have beer,
asserted as our national policy shall
be indorsed or withdrawn.
"This is the paramount issue. No
lesser issue must cloud it, no unrelated
problems must confuse it.
"In the submission of this issue to
the electorate, we, of this convention,
hold these truths to be self-evident to
every student of America's history, to
every friend of America's institutions:
"1. That the United States is con
strained by the traditions of its past,
by the logic of its present and by the
promise of its future to hold itself
apart from the European warfare, to
save its citizens from participation in
the conflict that now devastates the
nations across the sea.
"2. That the United States in its
relations with the European belliger
ents must continue the policy that it
has pursued since the beginning of the
war, the policy of strict neutrality in
relation to every warring nation, the
policy which Thomas Jefferson defined
as "rendering to all the services and
courtesies of friendship and praying
for the re-establishment of peace and
right!'
"3. That save where the liberties.
the territory or the substantial rights
of the United States are invr.ded and
assaulted, it is the duty of this nation
to avoid war by every honorable
means.
