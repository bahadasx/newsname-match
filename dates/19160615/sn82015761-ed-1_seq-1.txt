HOW MUCH IS THE
WATER PLANTW0R1H?
Last week the News promised to
discuss the feasibility of munici
palizing the Williams public utili
ties, by purchasing the property of
the Williams Water & Electric Co.
will be understood, tho it was not
so stated.
In discussing the purchase ques
tion the News debires only to see,
if a basis may be found for friend
ly negotiations between the Town
and the Water and Electric com
pany. While the company is not
seeking to sell its property, as far
as the News knows, it has offered
n Cull VVkiJ Ika TV.n Co mitlrin.
no considerable effort to buy the
company's property, the News
assumes that it would buy, if it
could do so on terms satisfactory to
the people of Williams. Below is
presented a discussion of price,
reduced to mathematical term?,
which is offered as tentative, mere
ly, for at least one of tue fac'ors
involved is subject to modifica
tion. The discussion" of price will
center largely on these factors.
The News accepts the income
figures of the Water & Electric Cc.
The net income of $14,000 musi be
depended on to meet the expense
of purchase, of interest on bonds,
of replaeemect and to make up to
the Town the loss of taxes. The
News assumes an issue of 30 year
5 per cent ' bonds with , which to
make the purchase, which the
Water & Electric Co. has offered to
accept in payment for their proper
The News assumes that, if the
funds set aside annually to create
a sinking fund with which to pay
off the bonds at the end of 30 years
are invested judiciously as they
accumulate, 3 per cent of he pur
chase price will be sufficient for
this purpose.
The News assumes that 2 per
cent of the purchase price, set aside
each year and used when ' needed,
will provide for the deterioration
of the property and constitute a
replacement fund. Tbis fund . is
necessary to make ownership safe.
In purchasing the property of
the Water & Electric company,
Williams would lose annually
about $l,000in taxes.
Now arranging these factors in a
mathematical formula, an equation
with a single unknown quanity,
the tentative price Wiliiams can
afford to pay, represented by x in
the equation, there appears the
follwing expression:
5x 3x 2k
plus
100 100
plus plus 1000-
100
equals 14,000.
The solution wf this simple equa
tion gives $130,000. which under
assumption that the factors are cor
rect, is the price which the Town
of Willims could afford to pay for
the property of the Williams Water
& Electric Co. At this price the
purchase would he feasible, tha
consumers of water and eiectr.c
current footing the bill.
Were Williams to municipalize
h r public utilities, the Town
would have to increase the capacity
rf the reservoir in the canyon to
a supply of Water adequate for any
emergency.
The water and electric rates of
Williams are high. They would
have to remain about where they
are for the present, probably, but
with consumption increased, it
should be possible ' to lower them
later.
Mr Hug! es says he did not
want the nomination. Tell it to
the marines! The presidential bee
had 1 een buzzing in Mr. Hughes'
Donnet for, lo these many moiths.

on the market for horses.

he c:-i Ret which are not under 15
hands and are not under five and
not over ten years old. The prices
which Mr. .Word will offer will
range from $55 to $90 for cavalry
horses and from $55 to $125 for
artillery horses.

paign, but Holden can not give
time to it at present. From his

head, if he is not too exacting and
his price is sufficiently liberal.

Fire Destroys Mexican's Home
Ramon Negritti, a Mexican liv
ing at the south end of Second
street, lost two houses and a barn
by tire early Monday morning. It
is not known how the fire started,
but it was well under way when
the fire department got on the job.
The elevation of the ground where
the house was is considerable and
a fire plug was not very convenient,
so some time was lost in getting
water onto the burning building.
The fire boys succeeded, however,
in preventing the further spread of
the fire.
Negritti lost, besides bis build
ings, some household effects and a
part of his tiock of hens. ,

AZBILL BROTHERS GUILTY
Williams men who went to Flag-
staif to listen to the trial of Azbill
brothers report a full house with
ladies predominating. Tho speech
es of the lawyers were good there
was a lack of oratory. County
Attorney Wilson's statement of the
case was plain and convincing.
The result of the trial of the
Azbill brothers for the murder of
Henery O. Thomas of Peninsula,
Ohio, was phoned to Wilham9
Monday night. The jury was out
one hour. The verdi'tt was guilty
of murder in the first degree with
the death penalty.
Weren't you surprised at the
ridiculous figure Rossevelt cut in
ttje republican convention? His
friends insisted that lie would be
strong and get the nomination after
two or three hallots. On the third
ballot, the ballot that nominated
Hughes, R'josevelt had IS votes.
