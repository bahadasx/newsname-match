Extracts From Sen. Ollie James's
Speech Before St. Louis Convention
TP0UR years ago they called Wo odrow Wilson the school teacher
r Today he is the world teacher.
"There are happily two kinds of courage the courage of the
man who is willing to undertake the dangers himself and the courage of
the man that sends others to the conflict. Woodrow Wilson has both the
courage of the conflict and the courage to act coolly and sensibly when
he is dealing with the lives of others.
"We have done more to build up an army and a navy in three years
ihan the Republican party did in forty years.
"Woodrow Wilson and the Democratic party advocate an army bill
big enough to make aggressors think a second time before they strike a
blow.
"It is a perfectly easy thing for the president of the United States to
plunge his country into war if he is a politician before he is a patriot
"Of course our array could invade Mexico and march in triumph to
its capital, but after the war was over, other armies would march an
army of widows and orphans, an army of cripples and men broken in
health, an army of pensioners and an army of tax collectors gathering up
the earnings of the people to pay the great war debt.
"We do not want a foot of anybody else's soil and by the eternal God
they shall not take a foot of ours."

One Boatload Loat.
Indications were that one boatload

Among the survivors, two were re

The two boats landed at the mouth of

women, numbed with cold, drenched

dragged themselves from the boats and
sought what shelter they might find
along the beach. Some made wind
brakes from driftwood. Others found
no refuge from the wind and cold, save
the boulders that line the shore. Others
burrowed into the cold sand and spent
the night there.
Residents of Capetown, the nearest

Arbitration Is Proposed But
Strike Vote Is Believed
Inevitable.
New York. June 15 The railroad
managers today notified the heads of
the four railroad brotherhoods of em
ployes that they could not meet their
demands for an eight hour day, and
time and a half for overtime work.
They proposed arbitration as a solu
tion of their difficulties, or submission
of the dispute to the interstate com
merce commission.
This was the final answer given by
the railroads to the men after nearly
two weeks of discussion in Joint con
ference with the brotherhood heads and
probably means that a strike vote of
employes will be taken.
It is said that five weeks would pa
required to take the strike vote and
that when it was completed, another
conference with the railway managers
would be held before patting a strlkt
into effect.
Says It Is Not Vcceptablr.
A. B. Garrestson, head of tho con
ductors' organization, announced on
receiving the railroads answer, that
the arbitration was not acceptable and
that the proposition to submit the
matter to the interstate commerce
commission was impracticable, because
that body had no power to settle the
dispute.
