DELEGATES CANNOT
RECALL BETTER WORK
Do Not Remember a Session
When Everything Was
4
as Untroubled
Coliseum, St. Louis, June 14.—
With the keynote of "American
ism and peace, preparedness and
prosperity," the democratic na
tional convention began its first
session shortly after noon today,
with not a single element in sight
to disturb the harmonious renom
Ination of President Wilson and
Vice President Marshall.
When National Chairman Mc
Combs called the convention to
order twelve thousand delegates,
alternates and spectators packed
the big coliseum to the roof. Mem
bers of the national committee,
members of President Wilson's
cabinet and party leaders from all
over the country had places on
the platform. Plaster medallions
of Washington, Jackson, Jefferson
and Cleveland looked down upon
the delegates from the deoora
tions which consisted unlformely
of nothing but the American flag.
The only picture of President Wil
son in the hall hung in front of
the speaker's desk inscribed
"America first."
Vice presidential booms wilted
by President Wilson's direct
word that he desired the renom
In
atlon of Vice President Marshall
.were brought to the convention
hall but only as favorite sons'
compliments.
St. Louis, June 14.—Wilson and
Marshall and victory in November was
the program of the delegates who
crowded into the big coliBeum here to
day for the opening session of the
democratic national convention. There
probably was not one democrat who
went into the building who could re
call when a national convention of that
party entered upon its work with more
harmony than that which prevailed
among the more than 1,000 delegates
today. The candidates for president
and vice president have been decided
upon and, according to the leaders,
there will be no friction over the
party's declaration of principles. Only
the phraseology of a few planks in the
.platform remains to be agreed upon.
Expeet Big Crowds.
Despite the expected cut and dried
proceedings which the party managers
hope to enliven by calling upon old
campaigners to deliver ringing
speeches to the delegates at odd mo
ments during the sessions, the ser
geant at arms of the convention was
prepared with a small army of assist
ants to handle large crowds at all of
the meetings. Every seat In the oval
shaped hall has been allotted and ar
rangements were made to take cars
of hundreds In spaces back of the
seats and in the aisles. The interior
of the coliseum was handsomely dec
orated, the American colors, of course
predominating.
The city itself was dressed for the
occasion, the fact that this was Flag
day, the anniversary of the birth of
the American flag, helped in'the dis
play of colors.
All For Wilson.
Quite in contrast to the republican
convention at Chicago when more
than a score of different kinds of but
tons were worn announcing favorite
son candidates for president, there
was but one button seen on the dele
gates today and that carried a like
ness of President Wilson. Delegates
shouted for Wilson, wore neckties
..with the name Wilson embroidered on
them or carried pictures of the presi
dent.
Those who did not have on "Vyilson
buttons wore some emblem indicating
their favorite for vice president—
Thomas R. Marshall of Indiana, Roger
C. Sullivan of Illinois, Gov. Major of
Missouri or Gov. Morehead of Ne
braska. But only one of these ap
peared to be in the running, the pres
ent vice president President Wilson
has indicated his preference for his
running mate of four years ago and
there is not the slightest doubt that
his wish will be gratified. The other
candidates may receive complimentary
votes, but if the leaders who are man
aging the convention can bring it
about, Vice President Marshall will be
enominated by acclamation.
•V Provide for All.
There will be about 12,500 seats in
the Coliseum. There will be 512 seats
on the platform, 472 seats in the sec
tion reserved for newspapers and press
associations, 288 for weekly papers,
and 2,158 for delegates and alternates.
The remainder will be In boxes and
balconies.

FUTIC PART IN
CONVENTION TO BE 8TRUNG OUT
TO AVERT NOMINATION
ON FRIDAY.
fBY D. MACMANUS.]
St. Louis, June 14.—Superstition is
playing a big part in the national
democratic convention which opened
here this morning. In the first place,
the democrats decided they must not
open their meeting on the thirteenth
of the month so today was chosen
instead of the second Tuesday in June
as is the usual plan. Secondly, super
stition has put a kink in the plan to
end the convention on the third day.
It would be an ill omen, think the
faithful, to nominate President Wilson
for a second term on a Friday. So
the latest plan—and National Commit
teeman W. W. Marsh of Iowa vouches
for it—is to string out the program of
the closing day until after midnight
so that the president will be nomin
ated on Saturday morning instead of
Friday night.
Under the plan of action as now
outlined Wednesday will be occupied
in effecting temporary organization
and in listening to flights of oratory.
Thursday permanent organization will
be effected and there will be some
more oratory. Friday the platform
will be discussed at length and the
administration lauded until after/mid
night. Then will come the nomination
of the president and his running mate.
Ficht on Marshall.
By the way, the vice president has
somewhat of a fight on his hands des
pite the fact that things appear nicely
greased for him. Roger Sullivan of
Illinois has a hankering to get on the
ticket and Gov. Majors of Missouri,
is likewise out for the nomination. The
latter was a candidate at the primaries
in several states—Iowa among them—
and he has several delegations in
structed to vote for his nomination.
The Iowa delegation will vote for the
Missouri governor on the first ballot at
least and possibly may continue to
vote for him as long as his name is be
fore the convention. There is a di
vision of opinion as to what course to
follow. Some olthe delegates believe
that they are obligated by the primary
to vote but once for MaiJors. J. P.
Webber, one of the alternate delegates^
at large from the state, holds that the
delegation is bound to vote for Majors
as long as the latter Is a candidate.
Marshall's name did not appear on the
ballot at the Iowa primary.
Kntfe for Wilson.
No one believes for a minute that
the convention will fail to nominate
President Wilson on the first ballot,
and yet the streets and hotel lobbies
are full of rumors about certain dele
gations being ready to knife the presi
dent if opportunity presents. The
Texas delegates, though under instruc
tion to vote for Wilson, are said to be
hostile to him and willing to lead a
movement away from him if the op
portunity presents Itself.
But in the opinion of the majority,
about the only chance the convention
has for experiencing excitement lies

SUFFRACTPTANK
VICTORY WITH THE DEMOCRATS
IS SO APPARENT THAT
PLANS ARE SHATTERED.
St. Louis, June 14.—Victory,for the
suffragists in the democratic national
convention today appeared so close
that "Gen." Updegraff's well laid plans
to keep silent her 8,000 "marchers" in
the walkless, talkless "golden lane"
demonstration appeared to be shatter
ed. The participants had promised
their "general" faithfully that during
the two hours of the display they
would not utter a sound, and then, in
the closing hours of preparation, a
tentative draft of a suffrage platform
plank tendered them by democratic
leaders put them in a shouting mood.
The plank contains everything which
the suffragists have been fighting for.
It would put the party on record as
favoring passage of a constitutional
amendment to enfranchise women.
The plank as drafted refers to the
large number of voting women in the
twelve enfranchised states, one of the
principal arguments the women have
been using regarding their strength.
Members of the National American
Woman Suffrage association were ex
pected to put their unqualified ap
proval on the plank today and repre
sentatives of the woman's party al
ready have indorsed it. The latter
organization insists that adoption of
the plank should be followed by im
mediate action in congress but that, it
was pointed out, is something over
which platform makers have no con
trol. If the plank is adopted, however,
leaders of the woman's party will turn
attention to congress and try to force
the Suban B. Anthony amendment
through both houses before adjourn
ment of the present session.

MIKE OVERTURES
BY PLATFORM IS
PLAN SUGGESTED
SECRETARY BAKER SAY8 DEMO­
CRATS HOPE TO WIN OVER
PROGRESSIVES THAT WAY.
St. Louis, June 14.—Secretary of
War Baker, who arrived here last
night from Washington with the planks
of the democratic national platform
drafted personally by President Wil
son, will submit them to the resolu
tions committee when it is appointed.
Expressions of approval were heard
today regarding the suggested plan to
win over members of the progressive
party by making overtures to them in
the democratic platform. Secretary
Baker, in discussing this phase of the
political situation, said the party lead
ers hope to get progressive support
by drawing a platform
BO
that it will
meet with their approval.
Denounce Use of Mllltla.
Denunciation of the use of the
militia and armed guards against
organized workers is contained in a
proposed industrial plank submitted
by Frank P. Walsh, former chairman
of the federal industrial relations com
mittee, to Senator Stone, who will be
chairman of the resolutions commit
tee. The proposed plank also de
clares the right of labor unions to
organize.
The plank also would place the party
on record as recognizing the causes of
industrial unrest as being those named
by a majority of the industrial com
mittee in its report, the principal one
of which Is alleged unjust distribution
of wealth and income. Mr. Walsh was
unable to personally appear before the
committee.
A delegation of the Navy league,
which is here to advocate a larger
navy, will suggest to the resolutions
committee a plank along the lines of
the following:
Will Restore Sea Power.
"The democratic party recognizes
its constitutional duty to protect each
coast from invasion, and, realizing
that the peace, security and honor of
the country depends upon an adequate
navy, we pledge ourselves to an Im
mediate restoration of the United
States to the place of at least second
in sea power among the nations of
the world.
"The party advocates a navy so
strong and powerful that, coordinating
with our coast defense, it will be able
to prevent the invasion of our shores
and the destruction of our coast
cities."
Are Watching Bryan.
Many democrats familiar with the
activities of William J. Bryan in other
democratic conventions are not so
sure that the former standard bearer
of the party will not become active in
the present committer. Mr. Bryan
said he would not go on the floor with
a proxy, but might speak to the dele
gates if invited. It was thought he
might appear before tbe resolutions
committee in advocacy of some of his
ideas. Mr. Bryan said he did not ex
pect to present his views on prohibi
tion to the committee, but was here
only to observe and write his impres
sions of the convention.
Admission tickets to the Coliseum
were selling in St. Louis for |5 apiece.
Fifty dollars was offered for a series
of tickets.
SIXTM1INTH YEAR
IT IOWA IS CLOSED
SUCCESSFUL TERM COME8 TO AN
END WITH CONFERRING OF
DEGREE8 ON 431.
Iowa City, June 14. —The sixty-nine
year of the state university of Iowa
came to a glorious climax today in the
commencement ceremonies at which
degrees were conferred on 431 men
and women who-hafte finished courses
in the several departments and col
leges.
It had been an altogether successful
year indeed, the most briliant in many
ways thftt the university has seen.
Extraordinary growth in attendance
and notable achievements in scholar
ship had distinguished it. And as the
crowning event, came the graduation
of the largest class in history. Last
year's record of 375 was far outdone.
With 181 graduates the college of
liberal arts led all others. The law
college had thirty-three, the college of
medicine twenty-nine, the college of
dentistry seventy-five, the college of
pharmacy twenty, the college of engin
eering thirty-one, the graduate college
twenty-seven, the school of music six,
the homeopathic school for nurses 'five,
and the regular school for nurses six
teen. Eight advance degrees in en
gineering were granted.
The great majority of the graduates
are Iowans, and there is hardly an
Iowa county that has not several rep
resentatives in the list. Eighteen oth
er states and four foreign lands are the
homes of the half hundred or more
who live outside the state.
The ceremonies began at 9 o'clock
when the cap and gown procession

WH*
Truck Men East and South
of Town Sending Out Big
Lot of Strawberries
MANY CARLOADS
BEING SHIPPED
Thousands of Crates Find
Market in Big Centers
Supplies Employment
Truck growers of Ottumwa and vicin-"
lty are shipping immense quantities
of strawberries from this section to
many of the larger cities of the middle
west and northwest. This brings
money into the community and helps
to develop local Industry.
Local fruit houses are handling the
output on a commission basis and sev
eral cars have been sent to Chicago,
St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha.
Eighteen cars of the Ottumwa raised
strawberries have thus far been hand
led by Lagomarcino-Grupe and Emery
fruit houses and a dozen of the farm
ers and truck gardeners east and south
of the city are supplying the fruit.
The season is said by some of the
gardeners to be off in most places al
though a few of them are getting good
crops. It is estimated that little bet
ter than half the average crop will be
raised this summer but the quality is
good and the growers are finding ready
demand through the commission men.
By cooperating thus the growers are
afforded a market and shipping facil
ities and for the next ten days or while
the berries last, they will be seen
daily hauling wagon loads of berries
crated ready for loading into the re
frigerator cars.
Thousands of
Crates.
Although it is generally known that
a number of the truck gardeners raise
a quantity of strawberries near Ottum
wa, it is not so generally known to
what extent this cultivation is carried
on. Among the principal growers are
•the three Lelnhauser places, Louis and
Andrew Lelnhauser near Sugar creek,
and Joseph Lelnhauser up over the
grade nearer Agency The Hermans,
Bart and his two sons, Andrew and
Fred near Sugar creek, also Louis
Schaub, George Bissell, Charles Bar
ton, John Morris, H. Lewis, Bert
Wiley, C. McCoy and Louis Montagne,
most of them east of the city near
Sugar Creek, but some across the river
southeast of town. In all there are
probably 100 acres of strawberries in
cultivation near Ottumwa and although
but half a crop is being raised thia
year, the average output will be about
200 crates to the acre. This runs the
total crop into the thousands of crates
and shows jthe necessity for finding a
market for the berries that are raised
in excess of the local demands. The
places mentioned above have berry
patches ranging from a fourth of an
acre to fourteen acres in size, and do
not include all that have berries to
supply the local market.
Many Find Employment.
Louis Lelnhauser whose place is on
Sugar creek at the foot of the bill
alongside of which the right of way
road to Agency ascends, has had a*
high as 234 crates picked in one day
and was one of the first to market his
crop. Hundreds of children and grown
ups as well are employed in the berry
fields and many of the youngsters are
spending part of their vacation since
school closed in picking berries.
MASON8 VOTE ON DUES.
Davenport, June 14.—The Masonic
grand lodge of Iowa will vote at its ses
sion here today on a proposition to
raise the state dues from seventy-five
cents to $1, in order to secure more
money for its charity fund. Over $15,
000 was spent last year for charity.

Rome, June 14. —It was officially
announced today that Austrian sea
planes raided Venice on Monday night.
The statement says that one woman
was killed and four civilians Injured
and that the property damage was
slight.
An official report from Vienna yes
terday said that an Austrian air squad

tertainment of more than 600 Iowa
veterans of the Spanish-American war
and their wives and daughters, when
the United Spanish War veterans and

today. Elaborate arrangements for
banquets, dances and other entertain
ment features have been made and the
busineas section of the city decorated.
A feature of the parade' Friday after

PRESIDENT LEADS
FLAG DAY PARADE
AT THE CAPITAL
WILSON MARCHES UP PENNSYL­
VANIA AVENUE AT THE HEAD
OF 75*000 PEOPLE.
Washington, D. C., June 14-—Led by
President Wilson carrying the star*
and stripes, nearly 75,000 men, women
and children of Washington marched
up broad Pennsylvania avenue today
In a preparedness parade arranged in
eelebratlon of Flag day to emphasize
the national capital's demand for an
adequate army and navy.
The president had prepared an ad
dress on "America First," to be de
livered on the white house lawn after
the parade.
The demonstration was a non-parti
san affair and volunteers fromBtoreB,
factories, various government offices
and patriotic organizations were in
line.
The president, attired in white
trousers, blue coat and straw hat, and
shouldering his flag like a musket,
stepped briskly to martial airs played
by the U. S. marine band. He smiled
broadly and frequently raised his hat
in response to cheers as he marched
along between two District citizens,
escorted by Secretary Tumulty, the
white house employes and the white
house newspaper corps.
Ideal weather favored the demon
stration. There was hardly a cloud in
the sky and it was aB cool as late
spring. Enthusiastic crowds thronged
along the avenue from Peace moun
ment to the white house.
In front of the white house the presi
dent left the line of march and took
his place in a stand to review the
parade. He was joined there by Mrs.
Wilson and all the members of the
cabinet now in the city.
As the line swung around the
treasury building at Fifteenth street
and Pennsylvania avenue the presi
dent was confronted by a huge ban
ner bearing the legend, "Be prepared—
If you care about ninety-one electoral
votes, consider us—women's party."
Half a dozen young women with mega
phones saw to It that the banner did
not go.unnoticed. It was the work of
the Congressional Union for Woman
Suffrage.
CHICAGO CELEBRATES.
Chicago, June 14.—Flag day, the
139th anniversary of the American

BELIEVED AN AID
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER THINK8
STATE ADMINISTERED IN
SURANCE 18 FINE.
Detroit, Mich., June 14,-Goverament
health insurance administered under
federal or state jurisdiction will not
weaken individual effort. Instead it
will make the individual stronger by
Slaking him more independent econ
omically. This conclusion was stated
by B. S. Warren of the United States
public health service in a paper before
the American Medical association at
its annual meeting here today. Dr.
Warren was detailed by the public
health service over two years ago to
undertake an exhaustive investigation
of government administered health in
surance, and is the author of the re
cent report on this subject issued by
the United States public health
service.
"Everything points to the necessity
of government administered health In
surance if the health and well beiqg
of American wage earners are to be
properly conserved," Dr. Warren said,
"preventable disease, caused by pov
erty and lack of cooperation and sys
tematic effort by health conserving
agencies, is now causing havoc among
American industrial workers.
"Under a system of health insur
ance for wage workers administered
by the state, the poorest of workmen
and their families could secure ade
quate medical and surgical treatment
through the use of a fund to be sup
plied by payments of 50 cents per
week for each employe—25 cents to
be contributed by the employe, 20
cents by the employer, and five cents
by the community through taxation."
