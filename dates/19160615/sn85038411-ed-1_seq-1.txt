WILL NAME THEIR
TICKET TONIGHT
Evidently Disgusted With List
less Proceedings, They
Decide to Clean Up
CHEER WILSON'S CONDUCT
Approve His Actions; Not De
cided When to Adopt
Platform
Coliseum, St. Louis, June 15. The
Democratic national convention
changes its program of procedure and
agreed to make nominations for Pres
ident and Vice-President to-night in
stead of to-morrow.
The rules were amended and the
convention will assemble at 9
o'clock to-night to remain in continu
ous session until nominations are
made.
With one. demonstration after an
other to-day the Democratic conven
tion registered its approval of Presi
dent Wilson's conduct of foreign af
fairs which has kept the country at
peace.
When permanent Chairman James
recounted the diplomatic achieve
ments of the President in the negotia
tions with Germany the convention
launched into an 18-minute uproar of
marching cheers and waving of Hags,
in which William J. Bryan from his
scat in the press section joined.
There were calls for a speech from
Bryan but it was found that he had
slipped out while the demonstration
was going on.
Senator James appealed to the con
vention to quiet down and hear the
rules committee report, but his efforts
were futile until he announced that
Mr. Bryan had left the building and
would speak in the Coliseum later.
That satisfied the crowd and they
heard the rules report.
Nominations To-night
Chairman Glasgow presented the
i report of the committee on rules. It
I provided among other things that no
delegates shall speak more than thir
ty minutes on any subject; that nomi
nations for President begin at 8 p. m.
; followed immediately by nominations
tor Vice-President. Senator Reed of
1 Missouri, moved to delay the session
for nominations until 9 p. m. and ex
plained that St. Louis businessmen
| had planned entertainments for this
evening which would be nullified by a
night session beginning earlier than
I 9 o'clock. The motive by Senator
; Reed carried and a session for noml
i nations will begin at 9 p. m. to-night.
The report as amended was adopt
led. it was not decided whether the
• platform would be presented before or
after nominations. At 1.22 recess
j was taken until 9 p. m.
Eleven o'clock, the hour for the
convention to be in order, passed with
! the Coliseum only partly filled. Very
r few of the delegates were in their
seats and none of the leaders had ar
rived on the platform. The band en
tertained the small crowd while the
liules committee had a meeting to
1 talk over the proposal to proceed to
nominats'.on to-night instead of to
j nominations to-night instead of to
| been arranged.
The band played the antihyphen
| song "Don't Bite the Hand That's
, Feeding Vou" and a male choir sang
jthe chorus. The crowd liked it and
cheered.
Effect Organisation
; The committee on permanent or
ganization at a meeting meanwhile
named Senator Ollie James of Ken
tucky as permanent chairman. J.
I Bruce Kremer, of Montana, pernia
! nent secretary; E. E. Britton of North
[Carolina, permanent associate secre
i tary; John 1. Martin, of Ct. Louis, per
: manent sergeant-at-arm and recom
j mended that all other temporary offi
i cers of the convention be made per-
I manent.
William J. Bryan got his usual re
ception when he took his place in the
press stand. Delegates and galleries
joined in cheers and applause.
Bryan Applauds
Senator James departed widely
; from the printed text of, his speech,
; but the sentiment he presented was
substantially the same. When he re
| counted the horrors of war and the
President's efforts to preserve peace,
: William J. Bryan, his face flushed
with emotion, rose to his feet and ap
! plauded vigorously.
When James recounted in implied
: terms the President's diplomatic suc-
I cess in negotiations with Germany the
I delegates wanted to hear it again,
j "Repeat it," they demanded.
| James repeated his statement and
jthe crowd rose up and broke loose
I with cheers.
Orators Will Prolong Convention
With the report of the Rules Com
mittee adopted, the further proceed
ings of the convention were expected
to be at the pleasure of the dele
gales. Managers of the convention be
fore it met said considerable time will
be given over to well-known and
popular party orators. That William
!J- Bryan, who is attending the con
vention as a newspaper correspond
ent and is sitting among the men of
! the daily press, will be called upon
for a speech, no one doubts. Mr.
! Bryan, it Is known, would respond and
make a speech of support for the
President and all the things Mr. Wil
son stands for. The Nebraskan was
quoted last night as saying that he
had nothing to offer the convention
! except that which the President
wanted. "His plank will be mine,"
Mr. Bryan was reported to have said.
"I expect to go before the people in
i his behalf."
Then More Oratory
With the program for the day car- !
lied out, the convention was expected
to adjourn until 10 o'clock to-morrow
morning, when the resolutions com
mittee will be ready to report. With
the adoption of the platform more
oratory is looked for and then a re- !
cess will be declared until Friday night ■
when the presidential nomination will j
be made.
Subcommittee .Meets

tion committee went into sessions to

SUFFRAGISTS SEE

Pennsylvania suffragists expect a
>' comparatively easy task in convincing:
• political leaders of both the Republican
s and Democratic parties that they should
B endorse suffrage for women when the

sion of the State executive board of the

- ; tiots at the Statu headquarters here to-
B | day.
j "Now that the Republican party in

s record as favoring votes for women—
each State acting for itself—and since
the Democratic national convention Is
- expected to go the Republicans one
better by favoring a national amend
ment. we believe that we will have lit
tle trouble winning our cause in Penn
syhania." declared Mrs. Miller. "Our
big difficulty with the leaders in the
; past has been their declaration that
'their party was not for it.' and now
j that this objection is met. we feel that
j victory will be ours both in 1917 and
