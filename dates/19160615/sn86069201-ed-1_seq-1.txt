TWO LOCAL MEN
IN TRAIN WRECK
Two of our democratic politicians
were in the train, wrecked near Owens
boru on their way to the Democratic
national convention last Monday night.
They were Messrs J. E. Robinson and
J. W. Sn ith and while both had nar
row escuea and were considerably
jarred, being in the overturned car at
the time of the accident, neither
were hurt nor their democratic ardor
dampened, for they proceeded on their
ourney after a delay of about two
ours.
J. Ingram, u mechanic employed
the garage, was painfully injured.
Mr. T. 11. Simmons, the local pho
tographer, who whs in the building had
a harrowing experience. He was In
the rear and was blown through an
opening in the roof. The remarkable
feature was that he was not seriously
wounded, altho bo received painful
bruises and scratches.
Mrs. L. G, Nelson, who was in the
flat upstairs, had a most frightful ex
perience. The floor upstairs was torn
loose, the furniture was hurled about
the room. She made for the stairway
leading to the street to And that It had
been completely torn away. She then
made her way through a rear window
on to the fragile remaining roof -and
was rescued.
LANCASTER SPEAKERS
AT C. 0. BANQUET.
At a banquet given by the Masons on
Thursday evering of last week at Crab
Orchard the correspondent from that
place has the following to say of two
Lancas terians:
The next speaker introduced by
Toastmaater, Wyatt. was Mr. George
W. Smith, Jr., of Lancaster, Dia
trict Deputy Grand Master and he
certainly impressed his hearers that
he was thoroughly acquainted with
the great work of his order and con
versant with its upward climb, Iloth
he and Toastmaater Wyatt boosted Mr.
George I). I.yne, of Crab Orchard, for
Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge.
Iloth stated how well worthy Mr. Lyne
was for the position.
Hev. Wyatt then introduced Hon.
It. II. Tomlinson, of Lancaster, We
were expecting grand things from
him and he certait.ly did not dissapoint
us. A natural orator, the silvery notes
foiled in beautiful cadence as he
ascended flight after flight of lofty
mined pictures. He told how, if he
were a painter, he would paint upon
canvas Oildfellowshlp: he would show
the open grave in which the father of
a family lay; on ono side the widow, on
the other the orphan; then the great
in j light of Odd Fellowship surrounding,
protecting and raring for them both.
This, he said, was what it meant (to
be an Odd Fellow. Such an older with
such principles, could not be kept down
and today stands without n peer. He
spoke of the grand noble women of
Kentucky, not falling to pay tribute to
his own wife, and then his eulogy of
women was perfectly sublime but at
the very last of his beautiful tribute to
her, he made this assertion He said,
we were told in the Illble that God
made man and that after man's crea
tion God rested. Then a rib was taken
from man and woman was formed; said
there was no record In the Bible that
God rested alter he created her, but
one one fact remained man had bad
no rest since she was created.

That Lancaster and Garrard county
believo In preparedness from military
standpoint was thoroughly demonstrat
ed last night when fifty of the best
young men of this city and county were
inspected for the state service in th
armory over the Rex Theater laat
night by Battalion Adjutant Stone
Norman, of Richmond and Firat Ken
tucky Regiment. Lieutenant Norman
has been on the ground for Several days
and has materially assisted Capt. II. C.
Ford and others in perfecting the or
ganization. Captain E. R. Gibson, of,
the 19th U. S. Infantry came in Mon
day and inspected the company Monday
evening at the armory.
When asked what he thought of the
line up", said, "I have never seen a
handsomer lot of voung men and I pre
dict for them ono of the best company's
in the service". The Csptain and First
Lieutenant were elected Monday even
ing and resulted in the unanimous
choice cf D C. Ford for Captain and
W. 11. Mason Jr. as First Lieutenant
The Second Lieutenant will be named
at a later date, it being important
though that the above be named Mon
day night, that Capt. Gibson might
make his reportto the War department.
The maximum number for a single
company is 75 including officers and
privates and while nearly fifty have
already enlisted, the indications now
are that the full quota will have been
reached before many days. Those hav
ing any intention of joining should do
so at one, for under the present law
you enlist now for only three years,
but after July 1st, all enlistments will
be for a term of six years, under the
laws of the last congress relating to
the federation of the National guards.
Captain Ford is exceedingly anxious
for about 20 more recruits as he wishes
to make a good showing at the coming
encampment in August, which will be
held at Richmond Ky.
All privates will begin receiving pay
from July 1st, even if not on duty they
will receive $53. a year, but are com
pelted to drill one time a week for 43
weeks in order to receive this pay,
They will draw regular salary while at
the emcampment. which lasts fer ten
days.
Since the organization of this com'
pany, under a recent act or the LegiS'
lature, it devolves upon the Fiscal
court to furnish an Armory for same
and although compulsory, the entire
court will gladly do Its part 'and has
now the hearty co-operation of Judge
Arnold and County Attorney G. C,
Walker. At the nert meeting of the
Fiscal court the matter will be taken
up and th room over the Rex Theater
will probably bo rented, 'which will
make an ideal place, the room being 40
feet wide by 100 feet long.
Adjutant General Ellis had hoped to
be present at the meeting of the
company, but was unavoidably detained
and haa promised to be hero real
soon and inspect the entire company.
U. S. Sargeant, E. L. Shelton, of the
20th., Infantry came in yesterday and
will remain with the boys throughout
the summer, giving them the necessary
training and acquainting them with
tactics and manual exercises. The
entire roster of the 'company as in
spected is as follows:
Ilascom C. Ford, Captain
William R. Mason, Jr, 1st. Lieutenant,
