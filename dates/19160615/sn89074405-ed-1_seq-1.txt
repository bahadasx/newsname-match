Minot.N. D., June
15.—With
800
bankers and visitors In the city, the
thirty-second annual convention of the
North Dakota Bankers' association
opened here this morning. Aside from
North Dakota members including
large contingents from Fargo and
Grand Forks, St. Paul and Minnesota
bankers are in attendance.
Representatives from practically all
the twin city financial Institutions ar
rived in two special cars over the Soo

Hawloy's Address.
The sessions today were devoted
largely to addresses on "The Federal
Land Loan Bank" and "Thrift" and
to the presentation of reports.
N. F. Hawley of the Farmers and
Mechanics Bavlngs bank of Minne
apolis, was one of the principal speak
ers. He discussed the proposed fed
eral land loan act, pointing out Its
disadvantages and comparing it with
the European system. Mr. Hawley
reviewed conditions in this country
showing how different they are from
European, after which he made an
outline of the law. It is patterned
largely after the European system, he
said. He then proceeded to state rea
sons why the American farmer does
.not feel the-need of the law. The
American fanner.'he said, on account
I of new conditions of agriculture, is ln
creasing loans rather than authorising
.' them as the.European system calls for.
The farmer of this country has not
become accustomed to the co-opera
tive s^t#in Sis the law In Europe re-

The premier made a touching refer
ence to the death of Field Marshal
Earl Kitchener as "leaving a place in
our constitutional life that none else
can flll and si memory that will live
as long as the: British empire."
Lord Kitchener" had bequeathed to
the country an array of armies, said
the premier, and it was for the coun
try to make the best use of these.
In a survey of the situation, Pre
mier Asquith declared that the Rus
sian advance was one of the most
brilliant features of the war.
The Italians, Mr. Asquith said, were
making resistance to the Austrian on
slaught which every day #tts becom
ing more effective. As for the French,
nothing could exceed the valor with
which they were maintaining the de
fence of Verdun. Co-operation among

"This war is not merely a Struggle
of armies," the premier continued.
"It ls a struggle of material and eco

In the long run .to be the deeldlng

Denounces Foreign Plots in
Flag Day Address at
•Washington, Ji!me, V5.-*A charge
that foreign-born citizens-of the Uni
ted States are trying to levy political
blaokniail and to undermine the ln
fliience of the national government
^was made by President Wilson in a
flag day speech. His assertion sound
ed the keynote of one of the foremost
Issues on which he will go before the
country for re-election, arid touched
lipon a platform declaration which
will be submitted by the administra
tion to. the St. Louis convention.
The president spoke before a crowd
of thousands gathered at the foot of
Washington monument, after her had
reviewed for Ave hours a great pre
paredness parade* at the head of
which' lie' himself had marched down
Pennsylvania avenue. He declared
that not since the civil war had it
been tested as it now is being tested,
whether the Stars and Stripes stood
for any one united purpose.
"There is disloyalty active in the
United Statse and it must be absolute
ly crushed," declared the president,
speaking emphatically. "It proceeds
from a minority, a very small minor
ity, but a very active and subtle
minority.
"It works underground, but it also
shows Its ugly head where we can see
it and there are those at this mo
ment who are trying to levy a species
of political blackmail, saying:' 'Do
what we wish in the interest of for
eign sentiment or we will wreak our
vengeance at the polls.' That is the
sort of thing against which the Amer
ican nation will turn with might and
triumph of sentiment which will teach
these gentlemen once for all that loy
alty to this flag is the first test of tol
erance in the United States."
The president's words were taken
as an open challenge' to foreign-born
Americans who, he had learned, are
opposing him -for re-election. Officials
close to him said he was outlining
his stand on what he had determined
to make a predominant issue in his
campaign.

directions but south.

ed on both banks of the river Meuse
on the Verdun front. The Germans
are directing a heavy fire on Fort
Souville, northeast of the fortress,
whose guns have so far lent powerful
aid in the balking efforts of the
crown prince to push the French
back to their inner line of defense.

south of CumiereS, where Germans
already have driven a wedge into the
French lines is an especial point of at
