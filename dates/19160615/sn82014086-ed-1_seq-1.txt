MEW HAVEN ROAD FILES
ANSWER TO C. S. M ELLEN

In Suit Brought by Latter to Reoevsr
178,222 Alleged to be Due Him.
New York, June 14, Answer was
filed today by the New York, New Ha
ven and Hartford Railroad company to
the suit brought against It -by Charles
B. Mellen, " former president of the
corporation, to recover 1ft&1 alleged
to be due him for expenses and ser
vices to the company and 75,000
which be claims the company owes
him up to January IS last for salary
under a,, five-year contract at J 30,000
a year. . -- . ' . -
t The company asserts that while the
agreement claimed to be In force by
Mr. Mellen was entered into on July
18, 1913, it was abrogated by a letter
from Mellen-to the board of directors
dated Oct. 20, 1913, In which the for
mer' president of .the road is alleged
to have declared that he - would not
accept the "compensation agreed to
be paid me under our contract."
Frank E. Hall, who certified to the
acknowledgment of this letter- by the
ocmpany, declared in an affidavit that
thereafter the directors ceased to aval
themselves of Mr. Mellen's advice and
that the former president never per
formed -any services under the agree
ment which set forth that he was to
be paid for acting in an advisory ca
paeity. The company also claims that
he was not to be-.paid in compensa
tion for services, but- as a gratuity for
past -services and In consideration of
his resigning as president. ;
The claim for expenses likewise la
rejected by ' rc company for similar
reasons and because, it is alleged, no
demand for the sum named ever was
made to the company.

that not -since the Civil war had it
been tested aa It now is being tested
whether the Stars- and Stripes stood
ror any one united purpose.

it; and there are those at this mo
ment -who are trying to levy a spe

at tne pons." That is the sort of thing
against which the American nation
will turn with a might and triumDh
of sentiment which will teach these

national policy shall be endorsed or
withdrawn," Glynn told the conven- 4

fuse It."
