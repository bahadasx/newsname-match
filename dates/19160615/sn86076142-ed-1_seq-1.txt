COLISEUM, ST. LOUIS, June 15. While the democratic conven-
tion was organizing and hearing the speech of Permanent Chairman
Ollie James, the platform makers were working on the President's
own draft" of various suggested planks. An eighteen-minute dem
onstrat ion interrupted James when he recounted the President's
diplomatic victory jn negotiations with Germans.
The rules committee recommended that the nominations of presi
dent and viee president begin at 8 o'clock tonight, Daniela and other
leaders approving. 1
It is understood that the tentative draft of the platform will
contain a woman suffrage plank at least as strong as that of the Repub
licans, expressing the belief of the Democratic party that women
should be enfranchised.
The platform will perhaps be completed late this afternoon, as the
leaders favored nominations tonight whether or not the platform
is completed.

St. Louis, Mo., June 16. The
achievements of the Wilson admin
istration', in enacting beneficial leg
islation and in keeping the country
at peace without sacrificing the na
tional honor were pronounced
epoch-making in American history
by Senator Ollie M. James ot Ken
tucky in bis address last evening as
permanent chairman of the Demo
cratic national convention.
"During three years of Its na
tional control." said Senator James,
democracy has enacted into law
more progressive remedial legisla
tion than the nation has ever had
written upon its statute books since
its birth. In former national con
tests In the last two decades our
party, came as a prophet, while to
day we come with deeds, not words;
with performance more than prom
ise. The democratic party has kept
its word with the American people.
We have made good." ,
The chairman reviewed at length
the legislative record of the admin
istration and eulogize! tne president
for his direction of foreign affairs.
The democrats, he said, had enacted
a tariff law under which monopolies
were curbed and unexampled . pros
perity attained; a banking law tak
ing the money control out of the
hands of an -oligarchy and making
panics no longer possible, and many
other reform measures of lesser Importance.

WASHINGTON. June 16. The Pres
ident selected Vance McCormlck of
Pennsylvania to succeed William Mc
Combs as chairman of tbe democratic
national committee. The admlnlstra
. lioa leaders at. Bt Louis were uotl-
Ite.
Oscar A. Daube, tbe New York cap
italist and promoter woo consum
mated the deal by whicn tbe entire
western end of the Tonopah district
was sold to the Sohwao mterests in
the name of tbe Greenwater Smelting
and Mining Company, arrived this
morning and almost immediately left
for the Great Western in company
with Manager John Magee.
Mr, Daube is one of tbe moat en
thusiastic believers In the future of
silver. He began to boost silver when
the price was 42 cents an ounce, pre
dicting the quotation would reach 70
cents. His statement was confirmed
in every particular, since It la well
known that the metal sold up to 77
cents.
"I look for tbe remonetlration of
silver," said Mr. Daube this morning
to the Bonanza, "and the first nation
to take this step will be England. As
a creditor nation Great Britain de
monetized silver, but now that sbe la
a debtor nation It is to her interest
to pay off her obligations in silver,
since there la no gold in the country
and silver Is the only other recognized
medium ot exchange remaining. The
situation Is Illustrated by the fact that
Germany is coining iron tokens to pay
its soldiery. That gallon would pay
one dollar an ounce for silver if It
were possible to have the metal de
livered, but the blockace puts an em
bargo on any movement of that char
acter. I believe the war will not last
more than ninety days longer, aa all
contenders have reached the point of
jxliaustion. both physically and finan
cially, and there la no means of keep
ing up the warfare. Tbe present slump

mark, as he Is confident the next rise
will take the metal above the previous
hisrh mark -
"Tonopah occupies one of the
strongest positions In the investment
market, aa it Is merely a question of
time before every ounce that can be
produced by her mines will command
much higher than the highest prices
of the past two years. Before this
comes you will hear or some import
ant developments that are pending
and which will be consummated in
time for the local interests to reap
huge profits. From the ear on which
I said silver was going to seventy
cents I have never faltered in my
faith."
