EASL K1TCBENEI AND
STAFF MEET DEATH.
London Dispatch, June 6.
The news that Earl Kitchener,
Secretary of 8tate for "War and
his staff, who were proceeding to
Russia aboard the cruiser Hamp
shire were lost off tifcOkney Is
lands last night, was the most
stunning blow Great Britain has
received since the war began.
This is the second shock the
country has sustained within a
week. The other was when the
newspapers appeared Friday eve
ning with the first intelligence of
the naval battle in the North Sea
in the form of a list of the ships
lost, with virtually no intimation
that there was any compensa
tion in the way of enemy losses.
The bulletin telling of the death
of Kitchener gave the country
ven a greater shock.
Kitchener was the one outstan
ding personality whom the peo
ple talked of and believed in as a
great man notwithstanding news
paper attacks when a former per-
iod of the war threatened to un
dermine his popularity and the
public confidence in him.
ADMIRAL JELLICOE'S REPORT,
A telegram from Admiral Sir
John Jellicoe, commander of the
fleet, giving the bare Jacts, was
received at the Admirulity about
11 o'clock in the moraine:. The
first official announcement was
issued about 1:30 in the after
noon. Admiral Jellicoe's report to the
Admirality was as follows:
" "I have to report with deep re
gret that His Majesty's ship
Hampshire, Capt. Herbert J. Sa
vill, R. N., with Lord Kitchener
and his staff on board, was sunk
last night at about 8 p.m., to
the west cf the Orkneys, either
by a mine or .a torpedo.
'Tour boats were seen by ob
servers on sh'ore.to leave the
ship. The wind was north-northwest
and heavy seas were run
ning. Patrol vessels and destroy
ers at once proceeded to the spot
and a party was sent along the
coast to search, but only some
bodies and a capsized boat have
been found to the present. As the
whole shore has been searched
some to seaward, I greatlv fear
that there is little hope of there
being any survivors.
"No report has yet been heard
from the search patty on shore.
"H. M. 8; Hampshire was on
her way to Russia."
When the official announce
ment finally was issued the fact
spread about London sometime
before the newspapers were on
the streets. ' There., was a crowd
about the stock exchange .which
required police reserves to deal
with. The police told every one
to move on; that there was no
truth in the reports,
At the same time another mass
of people was assembled about
the government offices in White
hall. All the windows of the War
Office had the curtains lowered
That confirmed .the rumor be
yond doubt Other crowds gath
ered around the newBpaer offices.
When the boys came out. with
armsful of extras the peopleJ.M
on them and fought for the pa
' pers." In the coursd of the after
noon the flags, on the buildings
were flown at half mast.
The English undoubtedly are a
stoical people, but no one could
have walked the London streets
today without perceiving that
something which .the common
people took as a calamity had
befallen them. '
Z The foreign office was sadden
ed by the loss of one of its most
valued members, Hugh James 0'
Beirne, while Sir Frederick Don
aldson and Brigadier General El
: ifiKhawol the Ministry of Muni-
Thi Worifs Richest Mil.
The Lenoir News thus elabo
rates on the world's richest man:
The world's richest man isn't
John D. Rockafeller. Neither is it
any of the Rothschild, nor John
Hays Hammond, who owns en
ough mineral lands to finance a
government. It is not the fellow
who owns about half the timber
of the United States either we
have forgotten his name; mill
ionaire are of so little impor
tance around this office. It is the
czar ol Kussia the wealthiest
man of all the world.
Nobody knows the amount of
his wealth, and he doesn't know
himself. It is estimated all t h e
way from ten to thirty billions
of dollars, and his income is sup
posed to be about a million dol
lars a day, or more, nobody
knows anything about that, ei
ther.
As head of the church, he owns
all of the church property of the
realm, amounting to billions.
But that can be left out of the
consideration. He ownsinhis
own name a hundred and fifty
million acres'of land, and upon
this land is the most magnifi
cent timber, the most colossal
mines, and agricultural lands en'
ougb to furnish food lor a na
tion of people. The state or gov
ernment, pays him a salary of
ten million dollars a year, and if
he wanted more, all he would
have to do would be to sign an
order demanding it, since he is
the state himself, in a sense,
The czar pays his own expens
es. That is, he maintains his own
palaces and royal residences,
some one hundred in number,
and takes care of the cost of the
household of the royal persona
ges of the nation. This involves
some thirty thounsand servants,
three hundred automobiles, five
thousand horses, and a small ar
my of soldiers and secret service
men. So it is necessary that he
have considerable income.
All of the mines of Siberia are
owned by the czar personally. Ho
gets a royalty upon every ounce
of mineral that is mined. The
agricultural lands are rented,
and the forests are being worked
up into timber which must be
accounted for. So no matter how
the war terminates, unless Ger-
rnanv is able to overrun Russia
and take the entire country, the
czar fcn't likely to suffer from
the heat in summer nor the cold
in winter.
"Would you call Uncle Peter a
stingy man?" "Well, no, I'd mere
ly say that he had all his gener
al impulses under perfect control.'

tions were known to be men
whom the Nation could little af
ford to lose. They are all report
ed lost on the Hampshire.
The fact that the cruiser Hamp
shire with between 200 and 300
men had sunk was generally ac
cepted simply as an unfortunate
detail of the day. The King came
from Windsor and sent for Pre
mier Asquith when he heard the
news. The War Council held a
long session.
Earl Kitchener met death at a
moment which will insure his po
sition in British history. He was
almont the only member of the
Government who from the begin
ning confidently asserted that
this would be a long war his
lowest estimate was three years
and he insisted that the Gov
eminent should make its plans
accordingly. The organization of
the enormous new British army
which he began is well under way.
There is no evidence to show
whether the Hampshire was tor-
nedoed bv a submarine or strck
a mine. ;. . 'v..
THE HORRORS AT VERDON.
"It is a battle of madmen in the
midst of a volcanic eruption," is
the description given of the fight
ing at Verdun, by a French staff
officer. He said:
"Between Saturday morning
and noon Tuesday we reckoned
the Germans 'used up' 100,000
men on the west Meuse front, a
lone. That is the price they paid
for the recapture of our recent
gains and the seizure of our out
lying positions. The valley sep
arating Le Mort Homme from
Hill 287 was choked with bodies.
A full brigade was mowed down
in a quarter hours' holocaust by
our machine guns.
"The scene there is appalling.
but is dwarfed in comparison with
fighting around Douaumont.
West of the Meuse, at least, one
dies in the open air, but at Dou
aumont is the horror of darkness
where the men fight in tunnels,
screaming with the lust of butch
ery, deafened by shells and gre
nades, stifled by smoke.
"Even the wounded refuse to
abandon the struggle. As though
possessed by devils, they fight
on until they fall senseless from
loss of blood. A surgeon in a
front line post told m that in a
redoubt at the south part of the
forts of 200 French dead, fully
half had more than two wounds.
Those he was able to treat seem
ed utterly insane. " They kept
shouting war cries and their eyes
blazed, and, strangest of all, they
appeared indifferent to pain. At
one moment anaesthetics ran
out, owing to the impossibility
of bringing forward fresh supplies
through the bombardment. Arms
even legs, were amputated with
out a groan, and even afterwards
the men seemed not to have felt
the shock. They asked for acig
arette or inquired how the bat
tie was going.
"Our losses in retaking the fart
were less heavy than was expec
ted, as the enemy was demoral
ized by the cannonade by far
the most furious I have ever seen
from French guns and also was
taken by surprise. But the sub
sequent action took a terrible
toll. Cover was all blown to pie.
ces. .fcvery uerman rusn was
preceded by two or three hours
of hellstorm, and then wave af
ter wave of attack in numbers
that seemed unceasing. Again
and again the defenders' ranks
were renewed.
"Neverhaveattacksbeen push
ed home so continuously. The
fight for Cemetery Hill at Get
tysburg was no child's play, nor
for Hougomontat Waterloo, but
here men have been flung 5,000
at a time at brief intervals for 48
hours. Practically the whole sec
tor has been covered by a can
nonnade compared to which (jet
tysburg was a hailstorm and Wa
terloo mere fireworks. Soroeshel
holes were 30 feet across; the ex
plosion killing fifty men simulta
neously.
"Before our lines the German
dead lie heaped in long rows.

lated there 7,000 in a distance oi

"The dogged tenacity needed
to continue the resistance far sur
passes the furious plan of the at

cannot long maintain their pres
ent sacrifices, since Saturday the
enemy has lost two, if not three,

COLONEL M0SBY.
8tatevllle Landmark.
Col. Mosby, who died in W ash-
ngton last week, was one of a
lew Confederates of prominence
who joined the Republican party
early after the war and for that
reason he wasnot popular with
his comrades or at least did not
enjoy that degree of popularity,
nor receive the honors from his
former comrades-in-arms, which
his service for the Confederacy
would ordinarily have warran
ted. It may seem strange to the
younger people ol this genera-
tion that Col. Mosby s politics
should have in any degree detrac
ted .from the fame he admittedly
won as a soldier. At that time,
however, the conditions were dif
ferent. The Republican party
was responsible for the Recon
struction Era which attempted,
and in some localities succeeded,
in putting the former slave over
the former master. This was an
inexcusable humiliation and the
bitterness it engendered was
fierce. In localities whe i e the ne
gro population was more numer
ous than the white, it was sim
ply a question of whites against
the blacks, in politics and the
white man who lined up against
his color had a hard time. More
especially was this true of men
who had served in the Confeder
ate army. They were looked up
on as repudiating all they had
ought for if they voted with the
Republicans, which was at that
time equivalent to deserting the
South and joining with former
foes against home people.
So much by way of explanation.
Col. Mosby 's joining the the Re
publicans may have resulted from
a feeling of gratitude to Gener
al Grant and the noted Confeder
ate may have been unjustly cen
sured. Col. Mosby was a young
awyer in Virginia when the great
conflict began. He organized an
independent band ol cavalry that
raided the Union army outposts,
captured supplies, invaded the
enemy's territory and harassed
and harried the enemy continu
ally by appearing unexpectedly,
doing a lot of damage and dis
appearing as if by magic. Mos-
by's men were noted fortneirdar
ing. Their warfare was irregular
and when the surrender came the
Federal government was not dis
posed to allow Mosby to go on
parole along with the regular sol
diers of the Confederacy. In short
he was to be treated as an out
law and he might have suffered
death but for the intervention of
Gen. Grant. When Grant was a
candidate for President, Mosby
stumped Virginia for him and
naturally thereafter casit his for
tunes with the Republican party,
whether he so intended from the
beginning or not. His act,assta
ted, may have been one of grati
tude and not deserving of criti
cism. But he acccepted reward
for his service. He was consul
general to Hongkong for a time,
an important post, and was for
years aiterwara up to a i e w
years ago in a position under
the Deparrraent of Justice in
Washington. When he accepted
office under the Republican ad
ministration Col. Mosby's former
comrades doubtless felt that he
had "sold out," and like Genera!
Lonestreet of Georgia, who pur
sue'! a similar course, the daring
Confedejate raider was uot there
after popular with the Confeder
ate veterans.

Horse Tbitf Escipes From Boom tail.
During the circus on last Fri
day, while Sheriff Moody and his
family were away, Brack Rob
erts, alias John Whaley, made
good his escape from the county
jail, and when the Sheriff arrived
Whaley, held for horse-stealing,
had covered considerable dis
tance and all efforts on the part
of the Sheriff and a corps of depu
ties to overtake him proved fu
tile. Upon examination it was
found that some bars in the rear
of the cage had been removed
by cutting the bolts and when he
got into the corriderhe only had
a brick wall between him and
freedom. Within the space of a
few minutes he had an opening
large enough for his body to pass
through when he "struck for tall
timber." A negro, Lee, held for
an affray, was- in the cell with
Whalev and succeeded in getting
into the corrider but ere he had
gained his freedom the sheriff
returned and again put him
behind the bars.
Just how the prisoners procur
ed the saw is unknown, the ne
gro beingnon-communicative on
the subject. However, two ne
groes were arrested charged with
the crime, but no evidence , devel
oped against them. The Sheriff
has offered a reward of $75.00
for the return of the escaped
prisoners, and has sent pasters
to that effect in every diretion.
He is about 20 years old; has
dark complexion, dark grey
eyes, brown hair, of slender build
and about 5X feet high. When
he left he had no coat, but wore
a red sweater.
