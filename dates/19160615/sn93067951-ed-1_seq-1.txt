IMew Primary Rules;
AH Voters Must Enroll
Mt. Croghan, June 12th.
Editor The Advertiser:
1 desire space in your paper to
call* the attention of the Democratic
voters of Chesterfield
county to the fact that the new
rules of the party adopted by
the last Democatic State Con
vention require that every person
who votes in the coming primary
election shall enroll himself
on the book of his precinct
or polling place, by writing his
name in full, his age, occupation
and post ollice address. If he is
unable to write, then by making
his mark to the same before
the last Tuesday in July of elec
tion years.
Now Mr. Editor I had the honor
of being a member of the
State Democratic Convention
two years ago when the rule requiring
primary election participants
to enroll under their own
hand and I remember very well
that the great argument used in
favor of passing the enrollment
rule, was that the roll so made
up would be filed with the Clerk
of Court for each county and
would become the permanent
Democratic Club Roll for such
county except such; as should be
added from one election year to
another, who might become of
age, tranter or move in between
such election yeais, and that
the books of enrollment wnnlil
remain open until five days pre
ceding the first primary. I very
well remember the task some
of us had in getting all those
who were qualified to enroll
themselves so that they could
participate in the elections.
Now again this year the same
difficult task is to go over again
with the further added disadvantage
that the time for enrolling
is cut down, instead of the
books of enrollment being opened
during the political campaign,
while tne matter is fresh
upon the rr.inds of those who can
vote and during the leisure of
laying by season, when people
get together and discuss men
and measures and interest in the
elections are at its highest pitch,
when every one is interested
enough to see after this important
factor in his right to say who
shall rule over him.
We have under the new rules
the spectacle of the books closing
the last Tuesday in July one
whole month before the primary
being opened, only in a time
when those who a?-p making
their living by fanning are busi
ly engaged in me cultivation
and harvesting of their crops,
and when their minds are occupied
more with their business
than anything else. This in my
opinion is wrong and especially
so towards those who live in the
rural districts of our county.
1 want to impress upon every
white man in Chesterfield county
the importance of seeing to it
that lie is properly enrolled.
Don't put it olF, nor delay because
the time slips away, and
almost before you are aware of
it the time for enrolling will be
passed and then 110 matter how
much you may desiro to vote in
the pr.mary for the man of your
choice you will be debarred unless
you are properly enrolled.
\nd besides, this enrollment
will be your membership in your
club and will allow you to participate
in the election ofyrur
club officers and delegates to I
your next County Convention
and from there to the next State
Convention where I hope s<>me
steps wi'l he taken to correct
some of these apparent evils.
Respectully,
J. Clifton Kivers.
