Through ti series of experiment
carried out in Italy, Marconi announc
ed that the problem of transmitting
wireless messages to aeroplanes has
been solved. Hitherto (his has been
impossible. Explaining the Invention
Marconi said:
"Hefore now aeroplanes have been
at a disadvantage with airships in
wireless because, while they were able
to transmit messages, they have not
heen able to receive them.
"This was because the receiving
signal was too faint to be distinguish
ed over the noise of the motor.
"We have been able to strengthen
the receiving signal sufficiently to en
able messages to be taken."
Great commercial opportunities are
open to the wireless after the war,
Marconi also announced.
Long distance transmission has
been signally improved. I
The wireless telephone already is
playing its part in the war. j
Marconi is a soldier and therefore
