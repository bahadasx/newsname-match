his age was 78 years, 3 months,
and 24 days.

:n the cemetery at Fort Littleton.
Mrs. L. L. Cunningham.
The friends of Mary Elizabeth
Cunningham, or "Aunt Lib" as
ihe was commonly called, were
shocked upon the receipt of a
:elegram from Akron 0., bring
ing the sad news that she had
passed away on Monday, June 5,
191G, at the age of 59 years, 3
months and 2 days. Although
it was generally known that she
had been in poor health for sev
eral years, it was only within a
few weeks of her death that her
condition caused serious appre
hension on the part of her fami
ly. The cause of her death was
diabetes.
Mrs. Cunningham was a daugh
ter of Mr. and Mrs. William Tru
ax both deceased, of Wells Val
ley. With the exception of a
few weeks each year, .she and
her husband have resided in Ak
ron, 0., with her only daughter
and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs.
Ellis Neal, Mrs. Cunningham as
sisting her daughter in the mil
linery business. "Aunt Lib" be
ing of a loving and congenial dis
position, and having a good, kind
heart, endeared herself to a wide
circle of friends. She leaves to
mourn their loss her husband,
her daughter, Mrs McNeal, and
her son Ralph Ralph residing in
Altoona, Pa. Also her brothers
Edward Truax, of Wells Tannery;
Richard G. Truax and Levi Tru
ax, Wells Valley; James Truax,
Shirleysburg, Paand one sister,
Mrs. Thornton Foster also re
siding in Wells Valley.
Funeral sermon was preached
Tuesday, June 6th at the Neal
home in Akron, where she died,
by the Rev. Duella, of the First
Church of Christ assisted by
Mr. and Mrs. Neal's pastor, Rev.
J. McAlpine, of Woodland Ave.,
M. E. church. A3 long as she
was able she attended services at
various places in the city es
pecially at the 1st Church of
Christ. She lived all her life an
jxemplary Christian, and was
aithfulunto death; and all her
sufferings and afflictions she bore
patiently and without murmur
ing. Her remains were laid to rest
n Bethel cemetery at her old
home at New Grenada on June
3th where her many friends and
neighbors had gathered to pay
'heir last tribute of esteem and
respect Everything that skill
and medical attention was done
cor ner, but seemingly, without
avail. The one sad feature is
the loss of a loving Christian
jnother and companion in life
leaving "L. L a,one ,n tne
Jna which he keenly feels. The
"owers that were sent to Mrs.
nmngham while living in Ak
ron, and after death, was a tri-
Booth-Knauff.
A beautiful wedding ceremony
was performed Wednesday even
ing, June 14, 1916, at 8 o'clock,
at the home of Mr. William Hull,
East Lincoln Way, McConnellS'
burg, when Mr. Emory Booth,
of Altoona, and Miss Nettie Alice
Knauff, of McConnellsburg were
united in marriage by the Rev. L.
F. Zinkhan, a cousin of the bride
ine parlors were decorated in
all the glories of a June day in
the forests. A pretty little
bride's bower had been arranged
in the large bay-window under
which, the happy groom met his
bride and in the presence of about
eighty guests, they repeated the
vows "Until Death do us part."
to the strains of the wedding
march by Mis3 Olive Pittman.
The bride's gown was a white
Georgette crepe over white satin.
She carried Bride's Roses and
Lillies of the Valley. Two nieces
of the bride, Mary Knauff and
Katharine Hull, were dainty lit
tie flower girls. Mr. Harry Heet
er, of Altoona, was best man,
1.1 M
ana tne matron ot nonor was
Mrs. Martha Mclntire. In all,
it, was one of the prettiest
weddings ever held in McCon
nellsburg. Mrs. L. F. Zinkhan,
wife of the officiating clergyman
of Washington, D. C, deserves
credit for her part in the arrange
ments.
A wedding supper was served
after the ceremony, and amidst
a shower of rice, congratulations
and good wishes, Mr. and Mrs.
Booth entered a waiting auto and
were whisked to Chambersburg
and took train for Niagara Falls,
Chicago, and other points. In
about two weeks, they expect to
be at home to friends at 4011
Fifth Ave., Altoona.
Made Long Trip.
R. S. Wible, Chambersburg R.
R. 7, left home on April 18th for
California. At L03 Angeles, he
visited the famlies of Miles
Hann, William Hann, Edward
Austin, William Greer, and Wil
liam Greer, Jr. From there he
went to San Diego. California,
and from San Diego to Tewando,
in Old Mexico; thence to San
Francisco, California. He stop
ped at many places on the return
trip, visiting George Hockin
smith in Iowa, and G. M. Wible,
in Ohio. It was an interesting
trip and Mr. Wible does not re
gret having spent the time and
money. In all, he traveled 8,000
miles. He reached home June
10th.
Church Dedicated.
Zion M. E. Church.'of Thomp
son township, was dedicated last
Sunday. A crowd, estimated at
four times the capacity of the
builcting, was present. The struc
ture cost $1,200 but at the close
of the evening services the debt
was practically wiped out. Rev.
Dr. Fasick, assisted by Rev. E.
J. Croft, officiated at the dedica
tion. - Zion church is built of concrete
blocks, is one story, and of suffi
cient seating capacity to accom
modate the membership and ad
herents. The community is to be
congratulated for having com
pleted this modern Duilding.
No Nams lo It.
Last week we received a long
letter from an unknown friend,
in which his neighbors were chi
ded for the alleged misuse of
certain road features. The wri
ter did not sign his name to the
article, hence we cannot print it.
We beg to state again that we
cannot undertake to regulate
matters involving personal dif
ferences in a locality, and more
especially when parties of both
sides are unknown to us. This
makes it fair to all of our many
friends.
bute of her many friends there,
and also, friends and neighbors
at New Grenada, added more,
for which all have the sincerest
thanks of the surviving memhers
of the family. "X"
Bad Roots.
J. Frank, Hess, near Warfords
burg, dropped a dollar into our
till lastMonday and then told the
following story. More than 21
years ago, Ayr township and a
manufacturer of road machinery
had a dispute about the owner
ship and payment of a scraper.
It seems the case was never set
tied in court. The machine was
"stored" under a walnut tree on
James Cooper's farm near Web
ster Mills where it remained un
til Monday when Mr. Hess then
bought it of Mr. Cooper for stor
age charges. Horses were hitch
ed to the scraper to move it out
into the road, but, "All the King's
horses and all the King's men
could not have budged it from
its long resting place. Attempts
were then made with crowbars
to raise the wheels out of the
ground. Nothin' doin'. The
earth was then shoveled away
and it was discovered that roots
as thick as a man's wrist were
holding the machine. At first
it was thought that the wheels
had sprouted roots,, and that per
haps, a new machine might grow
from them if let alone. But the
deal had been made, and Mr.
Hess wanted to transplant it on
his own farm and the roots were
cut away. They proved to be
walnut roots that had looped
themselves over the rims of the
wheels. It is not likely there
fore, that Mr. Hess will advertise
Scraper Seed" for sale this fall
Forty-One Years Ago.
Last Sunday, Rev. W. M. Cline
agisted Rev. Edward Jackson at
the communion, services in the
M. E. church, McConnellsburg,
At the close of service?, Rev.
Cline stated that while he had at
tended prayermeetings down
stai rs, it was the first' time in
forty-one years that he had been
in the upstairs room of the
church. On the last occasion,
April 7, 1S75, he united in mar
riage, in that room, "one of Mc-
Connellsburg's best young men
to one of its very best young la
dies, namely, George B. Shoemak
er, and Miss Blanche Baldwin."
Mr. -Cline said that there were
but two in the audience last Sun
day that were present on that oc
casion A. .U. Nace and George
W. Hays.
In Automobile Accident.
Sunday afternoon, June 4th,
R. J. Funkhouser and family
were returning to their home in
Hagerstown, having driven out
to Big Pool in their Mitchell tour
ing car. As they were passing
the Charlton road a few miles
east of Hagerstown, a car driv
en by Wm. A. Gehr, also of
Hagerstown, droppsd out sud
denly from the Charlton road
and in an instant the two cars
were into each other. The Gehr
car was a Buick Six, and both
cars were badly damaged. Mr.
Funkhouser sustained a badly
bruised leg, and his small child
was seriously injnred. The Gehr
party escaped with minor injur
ies. Mr. Funkhouser was re
moved to the Washington county
Hospital, but it was found that
no bones had been broken.
Bought Holsteius.
A pure-bred Holstein cow came
to the Brookside Farm this week
from the herd of S. B. Lehman,
Chambersburg. This, with the
start already on hands, gives the
Patterson Brothers a pretty good
foundation to build up a fine herd
in a few years.
Henry Carbaugh also bought a
registered calf at the same time
from the same party. News
readers like to hear of transac
tions like the foregoing. There
is a rapidly growing disposition
to raise, the standard grade
of livestock in Fulton county, and
we take pleasure in recording all
adrances.
Miss Lena Cromer and Miss
Hazel Myers of Lemasters, are
visiting in the Daniel Cromer
home at Fort Littleton.
BACK YARD AND CHARACTER.
Little Talks on Health and Djgiene by
Samuel G. Dixon, M. D., LL. D.,
Commissioner of Health.
Bret Hart once wrote a story
in which he pointed out that for
an insight into the occupant's true
character one must look at th
back and not at the front of a
man's house. Here was knowl
edge of human nature. If we
want to estimate character ac
curately we must have an al
around view and not accept face
values.
This brings us again to the
question of back yards. Is yours
as clean and well kept as you can
make it or is it littered with
trash, cans, kindling and other
rubbish? Is the garbage and
waste properly covered and free
from flies? Is the stable and out
house a fly breeding center for
the neighborhood? You have
work ahead of you for your own
health's sake and for the sake of
decency if any of these condi
tions exist.
It is a privilege to have a back
yard even a small one. There
are thousands of dwellers in the
cities where land is sold by the
square foot, who yearn lor a lit
tie space to call their own. And
those who are so fortunate as to
have back yards should care for
them and make use of them.
If there are children in the
family the back yard should be
their playground. A doll house,
turning pole, a swing or a tent
will provide almost unlimited en
tertainment and help to keep the
children off the streets.
If there are no children in the
family, a shovel, a rake, a hoe
and a moderate sized back yard
garden should afford reasonable
amount of healthful exercises
combined with pleasure and prof
it.
Would You?
If you had 1,000 bushels of
wheat to sell this year, would you
sell one bushel to each of 1,000
people at $1.00 a bushel and sell
it all on credit? Then after about
400 had paid for their bushel
would you go ahead and spend
$8.00 next year to raise and sell
1,000 bushels more on the same
terms ? Would you do the same
thing the third year so that you
would have spent at least $2,400
for labor and materia! during the
three years only to receive pay
ment for 1.200 bushels, leaving
1S00 bushels in the hands of
your debtors to make you gray
headed wondering how to meet
your bills? Would you?
Do you say it is foolish to talk
that way? That no business man
is foolish enough to do business
that way ? Well, if you are right,
then every country editor is fool
ish, for that is the way he must
run a paper or quit. Again: If
you sent a polite request to those
who overlooked the date on which
their bushel became due, asking
them to please let you have your
dollar or two doll ars and
some of those who bought of you
should say "Well, if you can't
trust me I will not buy again,"
would it hurt your feelings too?
Or, would you just keep on
spending thousands of dollars to
raise more bushels and take
chances on getting paid for some
of it?
It is said that there is no money
in wheat at 80 cents a bushel.
Listen! It costs about.90 cents a
year to send a weekly newspaper
for which we get a dollar for
some of them not all for every
editor "gets stuck."
We have heard it said f requent
y that "The Editor's dollar comes
easy." . in the light or the fore
going truthful statement will any
one again say "The editor's dol-
ar comes easy."
After a paper has run two
years, the loss of interest at 5
per cent amounts to 10 cents,
which, added to the original cost
-90 cents brings the cost to the
editor to just $1.00, leaving him
no proht whatever except the
iunl or editing the paper.
The Prayermecling.
Dear Editor:! wish to make
a plea for more and better pray
er meetings. They are undoubt
edly one of the instituted means
of grace, according to the teach
ings of the New Testement,
Why should anyone desire to sup
plement the teachings of that
Book? We are told that Pau
started his missionary work in
Europe at a prayer meeting, and
it was by prayer that the early
church was kept alive. So the
church needs the same influence
to-day. We are exhorted not to
forsake the assembling of our
selves together, for "Where two
or three are gathered together in
my name, there will I be in the
midst of them." It is good to
be where Christ i3. He promis
ed to bless us there. Why, then,
are some of the churches so slow
in making use of the prayer meet
ing as a means of strength to
the church and to the individual?
What I think is wrong about it
is, that the wires are not con
nected with the Power-house.
The Power-house is right, but
our wires are disconnected. We
can get along in our churches
without steeples, chandeliers and
organs, but we .cannot get along
without the constant wires of
prayer connecting the church
with our spiritual Power House-
Christ, the Head of the Church
Satan thinks he has gained a vic
tory when he can get a church to
abolish its prayer meetings.
The most vital prayermeetings
are those where individuals meet
intimately; for when a sincere
soul cries out in testimony or in
prayer, other souls are kindled,
and we should cultivate this per
sonal quality. There should be
an object at each prayer meeting
Some have subjects, but they hit
nothing because they aim at no
object. The weekly prayer meet
ing of Christian with Christian,
and all with Christ, in a meeting
of the human and the Divine, is
the only true prayer meeting.

Rural Credits.
With government machinery at
work State and National to
advance farming interests in
America, the financial and of the
business has, naturally, received
attention from our law makers,
and a rural credit system more
or less suitable to the needs of
farmers seems about to be estab
lished.
Briefly, it may be stated that
the system calls for twelve Feder
al land-bank districts with local
branches to be called National
Farm Loan Associations, the sys
tem being patterned after the
present Federal Reserve plans.
Ten or more farmers who desire
to borrow money may form an
organization and apply for a local
bank charter. The detailed plans
are too long to publish here. But
the central idea is, that farmers
will be accommodated with long
time loans, on easy payments, to
put them on a footing with cor
porations that raise money by
bond issue the farmer's paper
to be taken up by investors same
as bonds.
However, each borrower's farm
must become security for the loan
in double the amount borrowed.
We cannot see how this will help
eastern farmers who can borrow
from private individuals on long
time at as low rate of interest as
is proposed for the land-banks
6 per cent.
It may help westerners whose
neighbors are not money-lend
ers, and where legal rates of in
terest are higher than in eastern
states.
Made Good Run.
Last Saturday, Ed Brant load
ed up Chester Brant and wife
and Joe Ed wards of Taylor town
ship, and made the run to Wind
ber, south of Johnstown, in four
hours. They stopped with their
'riendi over night and returned
next day in about the same run
ning time,
Stop Occasionally.
We must rest occasionally. God
set the example when he rested
after having completed the work
of creation. He instituted the
Sabbath, making it unlawful for
Man to drive his tired body more
than six days without a day of
rest. He went even farther, de
claring that the land should rest
every seventh year nothing to
be taken from it except what the
cattle gathered. Again he order
ed that after seven sabbath rest
years had been observed, the
forty-ninth and fiftieth years
should be sabbaths. (Note that
"sabbath" is not spelled with' a
capital, for the people of Bible
times it carried a different mean
ing from merely the name of a
day. ) See Leviticus 25.
Rest does not necessarily mean
cessation from action. Rather,
it means a change for the mind
In the lower order of animals the
body governs the mind or what
passes for mind. But in the hu
i .
man Deing, tne oruer is or
should be reversed. It stands
to reason then, that when the
mind becomes weary of monot
ony, the body fails to perform
the every-day duties of life suc
cessfully. Self-slavery is the
stumbling stone to more failuies
than, perhaps, any other obsta
cle. Times without number have
we noted men who work by the
light of a lantern at both ends of
the day until their brains almost
stop action while the neighbor
who took time to think and rest
a little seemed to prosper finan
cially and socially to a degree
the other never hoped to attain.
It is very plain, therefore, that
we should stop occasionally and
do something out of the ordinary
so a3 to rest the mind, for the
business of farming is not what
it once was. A certain amount
of reading is as necessary now
as is the use of modern machi
nery, fertilizer, and all the new
things that no one can learn sole
ly by his own observation.
We believe that the automobile
will save many a weary country
woman from a home in an asy
lum. Be willing to spend a little
money to give her a ride that
will take her to new scenes-
sights and sounds that will re
lieve the tension on that weary
mind.
Farm Notes.
The National Stockman and
Farmer of a recent date contains
some timely hints, among which
we note that the high price of
farm machinery will in all proba
bility, continue or may go high
er, because manufacturers of
steel and iron are refusing to
book orders for material for fu
ture delivery, even at the high
prices now obtained.
The same paper gives warning
that while the price of "prime
long-fed" steers may touch $12
the "fair to good" class will sure
ly drop in price, and, further,
This would be a good year to
clean up and cash all trash in our
herds while the cashing is good."
The silo, like the auto, was a
ong time in finding its place on
the farm. But having found it,
we may very soon expect to see
every barn fitted with a silo, in
proportion as a knowledge of its
value soaks in.
Would you invest a dollar if
you knew for a certainty that
youwould thereby make $5, $50,
or possibly, $500, within a year?
We have the farmers' own state
ment for it that the foregoing
figures are fair samples of re
turns where counties aided the
State in the payment of the sala
ry and expenses of a County
Agent. It's about the same a3
having the farmers' institute on
your farm 305 days in the year.
The Dott Baseball team will
