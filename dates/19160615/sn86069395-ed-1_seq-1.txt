ENTMUL COMMENT.
There is quite a difference when
the Russians havo a supply of ammu-
nition.
Flag Day was observed by the Elks
Virginia Park last evening with a
rtost interesting program.
The Hopkinsvillc ball team has had
miltn n tnf nf now rilnivl InJpctpd into
it and there are hopes that it may do
better. It plays Madisonville today
on homo grounds.
Reports that German-Americans
wero behind him with some secret
organization has brought .from Judge
Hughes the following statement: "I
stated my position very clearly in my
telegram to the convention. My po
sition is one of undiluted American
ism and anybody that supports me is
supporting an out and out American

absolutely nothing else."

Muhlenberg County
To
Line.
At its regular meeting Monday the i
Christian County Road CommissionJ
ordered the improvement of the
Buttermilk road and its extensions
from here to the country line this
side of Dawson. The work was
really ordered done several days ago
but had been delayed but the survey
or selected for it stated that he would
start on the job this week. The en
tire distance from Hopkinsvillc to the
Hopkins county line is to be built, ex
cept possibly somo stretches of the
present pike which arc in good shape.
The Dawson Springs people have
already agreed that they would build
a correspondingly good road from
their place out to the county line to
join the Christian county pike, mak
ing a continuous and high class pike
from Hopkinsvillc to Dawson.
The commission has not taken ac
tion as to the Greenville road, the last
of the inter-county scat roads not yet
surveyed. The delay is due to the
fact that there are two branches of
this road and before the work can be
undertaken an agreement must be
made with the Muhlenberg county
officials as to which branch shall be
designated as the official route so that
when the improvement is made in
Muhlenberg county it will be on the
same road and will connect with the
road built in this county.
Plans and specifications for six
roads were finally approved by the
commission and United States Engl
necr Whittaker at tho meeting and
wero forwarded to tho good roads
department at Frankfort for approv
al. This is the last step and as soon
this nnnroval bv the state cood

plans and they are returned here, the

SAME OLD PAIR OF WINNERS
WILL BE NAMED AT ST. LOUIS
All Is Harmony And Good Cheer In The Democratic Convention, Which Began Yester
day And Is Going Through on a Greased Schedule Secretary Baker Arrives,
Bearing News of President's Desire For Vice-President Marshall.
St Louis, June 14. Arrival here
of Secretory of War Newton D. Bak
er, President Wilson's personal rep
resentative, bearing the "president's
own" draft of the platform and news
that he desired the renomination of
Vice-President Marshall; firmly es
tablished the harmony program for
the democratic national convention
which opens today when Chairman
William F. McCombs, of the demo
cratic national committee lets his gavel
sound at noon, leaders expected all
pre-convention discord to be blended
into one harmonious ' note. A pro
gram upon both the presidential and
vice-presidential nominations ,and the
platform as well has apparently been
agreed upon by the leaders.
Vice-presidential booms around
which most of the pre-convention
fights have centered wilted away un
der the influence of the personal mes
sage from the white house that the
president desired Mr. Marshall again
as his running mate.
DISPOSES OF OWN BOOM.
Secretary Baker also effectually dis
posed of the vice-presidential boom in
his own behalf which had attained
prominence in the behalf in some
quarters that Mr. Marshall lacked
genuine administration support.
"The president is for the renomin
ation of Vice-President Marshall,
was the emphatic statement of Secre
tary Baker.
Although Mr. Baker declined to
disclose the president's platform it
will dwell principally "on peace, pre
paredness for peace and prosperity."
WILL NOT CRITICISE G. 0. P.
ACTION.
Despite agitation by some demo
cratic leaders President Wilson, it is
' said, disapproved insertion of a plank
' criticising the nomination of a supremo
court justice for president, or favoring
a constitutional amendment prohibit
' ing justices from seeking other public
federal offices.
The president desire adoption of a
platform so progressive that it will
appeal to and attract members of tho
progressive party but without imopcn,
direct invitation to tho progressives to
swing their strength to the democrat
ic ticket, it was learned.
As to woman suffrage, it was un
derstood tho platform will probably
suggest that the women continue their
efforts for tho ballot in the respective
states, the primary authority for polit
ical qualifications.
The principal planks, it was author
itively stated, will deal with tho ad
ministration's trials and achievements
in handling international and Mexican
affairs, its rapid and deliberate steps1
( toward "preparedness for peace" and
the record of economic und industrial
legislation contributing to general
prosperity.
CAMPAIGN TO BE AGGRESSIVE.
Secretary Baker also brought inr
formation regarding the aggressive
campaign planned in behalf of Mr.
Wilson. The country to be covered
by leading democratic orators, Vice-
President Marshall, Secretary Baker,
Secretary Lane, Senator James, Rep
resentative Kitchin, of North Caro
lina; Senators Lewis, Hollis, Reed and
Owen and others from both the sen
ate and house will be among the
speakers.
BRYAN IS LOYAL.
St. Louis, Mo., June 14. On the
morning of the first session of the
Democratic National Convention, two
matters of unusual importance in their
bearing on tho campaign as well as
the course of tho Democratic Conven
tion are revealed. They were:
First -Formal announcement by
William Jennings Bryan that he will
make no attempt to throw a monkey
wrench into the convention machinery
that he will not even appear before
the Resolutions Committeo in advo
cacy of his pacifist ideas; that he is
earnestly for re-election of President
Wilson and will take the stump for
the Democratic ticket as early as the
latter part of August, if it is the de
sire of the Wilson Campaign Commit
tee. TARIFF PLANK READY.
Second Completion and indorse
ment by the leaders of the tariff plank
in the platform, the matter of greatest
interest to the business interests of
the country in connection with the
convention. The jiarty will indorse
the present tariff law and reaffirm its
belief in a tariff for revenuo only, but
will declaro both for a tariff commis
sion and the enactment by the present
Congress of anti-dumping legislation.
SUFFRAGE DISCUSSED.
Secretary Baker created some talk
by declaring in favor of women's suf
frage. This led party leaders to be
lieve that perhaps tho "President's j
suggestions" included a suffrage!
plank, but Mr. Baker declared speci
fically that he is speaking for himself
alone.
The militant attitude of Democrats
gathered here increased with the
coming of tho- secretary. This is not
going to bo so much a convention as
a campaign opening. The speeches
will bo campaign speeches. In con
trast with tho attitude of tho Republi
cans at Chicago in their negotiations
with Roosevelt, tho Democrats here
seem to fear no one, Bryan least of
all.
The convention will be a rally from
start to finish, full of enthusiasm and
unity. While it will probably not de
velop much of "news" except for
some startling platform coups, which
are suspected, it will show an undi
vided party front against the Republi
cans and real enthusiasm for the
tandidates.
Senator James, permanent chair
man of the convention, in a confer
ence tonight urged that the convention
be concluded in three days at the
most, and not stretched to four. He
said there was no necessity for hold
ing the delegates any longer.
VERNON RICHARDSON TO BE
CONVENTION SECRETARY.
Washington, June 14. W. Vernon
Richardson, ot Danville, secretary for
Senator James, left Washington for
the St. Louis convention, where he
will serve as one of the assistant sec
retaries. Mr. Ricliardson was noti
fied of his appointment by J. Bruce
Kremcr, acting secretary of the Na
tional Committee. Senator James'
Secretary served in a similar capacity
at the Democratic convention at Bal
timore and Denver.
TIRED OF
CARNIVALS
Cheap Shows That Have to
Be Censored Are
Tabooed.
Disgusted witli the class of shows
and the really indecent charnctor of
some of thorn which havo boon hero
in the past with carnival comoanies.
the city commissioners Tuesdav for
mally jwssed a resolution declaring
that in future no more carnivals would
bo permitted in Hopkinsvillc. Thero
has been a growing sentiment airainst
carnivals here for some time and the
action of tho commissioners meets
with general satisfaction.
In another scran with Mexican band
its Tuesday, tho Thirteenth cavalry
routed 2o, killing 3 :tnd wounding
several. Tho others escaped into the
brush on foot, leaving their horses
and supplies.
Hanly Crawfishes.
Frank Hanly. Procrressivo nnmlnnn
for Governor in Indiana, declines to
run because, ho states, tho Propres
sivo national convention refused to
adopt a prohibition plank in the plat
lorm at uncago.

ITALIANS DOING BETTER
Verdun Situation Has Under
gone No Material
Change.
London, June 14. In Volhynia and
Galicia, the Russians arc continuing
their strong offensive against the
Austro-Hungarians and Germans, and
on various sectors in both regions
they have made fresh advances and
captured additional prisoners and war
stores.
In Galicia the drive of tho Russians
has brought them across the Dniester
river, where they have captured the
towns of Zaleszczyky and Horodenka,
whence they are pressing forward to
ward the Pruth river and the Buko
wina frontier with Czernowitz their
objective. Numerous Austrian forti
fied positions in this region have fall
en into the hands of the Russians.
Farther north violent fighting is
taking place around Tarnopol where
the Austro-Hungarians, reinforced by
Germans are holding back the at
tempts of the Russians to advance in
the direction of Lcmberg, capital of
Galicia. Northeast of Tarnopol, near
Vorobieyka, positions have changed.
hands repeatedly in the heavy fight
ing while east of Kozlov, which lies
southwest of Tarnopol, the capture of
a Russian advanced post is a reported
by Vienna.
CANADIAN TROOPS GAIN.
The Canadian troops in the region
of Ypreshave made a ..notable gain
over the Germans, retaking from tho
southeast of Zillebeke in a "gallant
and successful assault" more than
1,500 yards of former British posi
tions which the Germans captured re
cently. The regained ground was
held despite a vigorous shelling by
the Germans. The Germans suffered
heavy casualties in the fighting.
After driving their wedge fnrtiier
into tho French line northeast of Ver
dun Monday, the Germans on Tues
day did not follow up their advantage
with infantry attacks. Only inter
mittent bombardments are taking
place around Verdun.
ITALIANS WIN SUCCESS.
In the Lagarina valley of the Aus-tro-Italian
theater the Italians havo
taken by assault strong Austrian po
sitions and repulsed heavy counter
attacks launched by the Austrians.
On the Posina-Astico front the Aus
trians, penetrated Molisini but wero
later driven out, and in the Sugana
valley they met with repfibe with
considerable losses, in attempt to ad
vance east of the Maso torrent'.
Slight successes for their respective
sides in Asia Minor are reported by
the Russians and Turkish war offices.
No important changes in the situation
in this region havo occurred, how
ever. The Russian "Come Back."
