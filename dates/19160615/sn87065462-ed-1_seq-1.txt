FIGHT JAPAN?
Brilliant Japanese Says WoJapan

Are Japan and the United State
destined to fight each othcrT Ar,o their

conflict inevitable?
The American jingoes Bay yes; bui
I very different view is expressed by
Jinji Kasia, a Japanese student at the
University of Chicago, whose brllliunt
oration "The Mastery of the Pacific,"
recently won the RosenwalJ Oratori

feeling of Japan's conservative ciasse
toward the United States anil Uieii
hope that a lasting friendship may .be
J cemented between the two oounlrins.
Among many reasons why I bey fchou'ri
be the best of friends, Mr. Kwsia gives
the following!
"However loudly the demagogue
may cry for war, there are many rea
sons why Japan and th". United Slates
should be strong friends. Our gt-o

Therefore we must be. strong friends!
As a business proposition, Japan
and the United States should be
friends. Our commercial, Jndi-pend
ence forbids us to go to war. The or

industrial plants are equipped with

i On the other hand, the United
States Is the largest customer of Ja-
pan. Sixty-eight per cent of silk and
169 per cent of tea imported by this
country come from Japan. You ladies
decorate your homes with Japanese
b art; you dress yourself with silk spun
by Japanese girls, and entertain your
; friends with tea picked upon Japan"s
' green hillsides. Fine and delicate is
the thread of silk, yet It bind together
our two great nations!"
"Should our two nations be involv
ed In war, who would reap any profit?

and the slaughter of Jhe noble sons of
i 1 two countries. It would cost the two
at least ten billion dollars in money;
and -who could estimate the value of
the precious blood that would be shed?
"But there is yet a stronger bond
xMaat has kept Japan and will keep ber

of sentiment, of gratitude, and of af
ctlon. From the days of Commodore
Wry, the kindly assistance your coun
jy has given ours has Impressed It--Velf

Japanese nation. Japan has known
America not through your yellow Jour

your universities who have carried
tame sweet memories of kindnesses
shown them by American teacherr
and friends. America can send to Ja
pan no better ambassadors lhan these
leturning students, who will const;

Mexico's "First Chief as a Mis

Governor of Coahuila Patriotic
Leader of Revolutionary Move
ment. t
What kind of man Is Carranza, Mex
ico's new president? The people of
i.e United Slates ye anxious to know
and with goodvreason, since the rela
tions of the two countries will depend
In large,, degree upon the character
and attitude, of Mexico's first chief.
There is so little first hand knowled to
on the subject, however, that the fol
lowing intimate view of General Car
ranza from the pen of Rev. S. G. In
man, a missionary to Mexico who
knew him well, will be read with in
terest: "Senor Venustiano 1 Carranza is a
native of northern Mexico, .the mo.sl
liberal section of the country, and of
the state of Coahuila, which leads aK
the others in schools, railroads and
other evidences of progress. My per
sonal relationship with him began
when ho came to the international
boundary line to welcome President
Madero, at wh'ch time he visited tb.9

ciation of its work, saying that twen

Senor V. Carranza, Mexico's "First

Later I knew him well while ho Wifs1
governor of Coahuila. I never saw a
man enter more earnestly imo the ef
fort to better labor, conditions, equal
ize taxation, extend educational advan
tages, and in geiu-rnl promote the pub
lic welfaie. Culled to Mexico City to
take a government position, be declin
ed to go sayirrg th.it his gre-it.st ambl
tion was to work out the problems of
his own state. The government which
l.e maintained In Tiidras Negras wis
the best 1 lu;ve ever seen in Mexico.
"After Muderu'B murder, Carranza
beconia the head of the revolutionary
movement and for six months 1 nd his
headquarters just -across the street
from my residence. I saw him almo-t
eery day and knew the group of
young men whom he had gathered
about him. In all these intimate re
lationships I neve.' once had occasion
to doubt the sincerity of his patriot -J
Ism and desire to serve his people. ,
"Carranza, contrary to the populai
conception of Mexicans, is doggedly
determined. He believes that pre
vious reform movements failed be
cause of hasty compromises with un
'emocratlc elements and that perman
ent peace will come only after a tight
to a finish. He looks at things from j.
distinctly Mexican viewpoint and be
lieves thoroughly that the Mexicans
are capable of solving their own prob
lems and should be allowed to do so
"In religion General Carranza woull
probably call himself neither a Cath
olic nor a Protestant, but would af
firm his personal faith in Christ and
hie friendship for both churches so
long as they keep out of politics. I dc
not believe he will take steps against
thevproper exercise of any religious
faith."
Toothache aa a Means ef Grace
A Japanese boy studying under Rev.
W. A. Davis, a Southern Methodist
missionary at Kyoto, told him this In
teresting story of his conversion:
"I was woke up about four o'clock
with an Intense pain In my -tooth. I
felt that I. could not endure It long.
Then I thought how lonely I was and
how I needed a helper, and for the
first time in my life prayed to God
I did not pray to have the pain stop,
but to have a helper. Then my heart
was full of Joy, and presently I was
able xo sleep. The next morning w her.
I woke up I had no pain, but my heart
was full of Joy. That Joy is still with
me, and I am still praying to God. I
am determined to be a Christian the
rest of my life." '

Pellagra - Preventable.
Dr. VV. '. Leathers Bays the Dis
ease Is Positively Curable.
That pellagra is a preventable
disease, that it is not communic
able and is positively curable, is
the trend of a bulletin on pel
lagra just prepared by Dr. W. S.
Leathers, v director of public
health of Mississippi, which is
well worth the study which it
should command
In hi'3 bulletin Dr. Leathers
does not review the special pel
legra producing tests which were
conducted by Dr. Goldberger,
with the help of members of the
white convict colony in Ranklin
County, which has already been
fully described. -He gives, how
ever, brief outlines of the sub
ject discussed, which is as
follows:
During the past year pellagra
proved to be one of the most
prevalent and fatal diseases in
Mississippi. The name pellagra,
has therefore caused alarm
amoung those who contraced it,
and justly so, because it was
usualy fatal- According to re
cent discoveries this disease
should no longer be looked upon
with alarm. It is now known
that it can be prevented and
cured.
Dr. Goldberger of the- United
States public health service
states:
"That pellagary is not a com
municable (neither infections or
contagious) disease, but that it
is essentially of. dietary . origin;
' That no pellagra develops in
thoes who consume a mixed,
well-balanced" and varied diet."
It has been shown conclusively
that a person eating the right
kind of diet, that is, a well-bal-
anced diet, such as milk, fresh
lean meat and eggs, will not
have this disease. In the event
this kind of diet -connot be sup
plied, owing to expense the pro
tein element of the diet, the
absence or lack of proportion of
which will cause pellagra, can be
supplied by a liberal use of le
guimes (beans or peas), "fresh
or dried, not canned." Pellagra
can be cured by the use of the
same kind of diet, provided the
the disease is recognized suffici
ently early. In fjther words,- an
earls diagnosis of the disease in
most cases is essentially its cure.
When it is realized that the
preventive and curative meas
ures of pellagaa are so simple
and inexpensive, there is no rea
son why the disease should long
er prevail, and cause such alarm
in the state. It is a question of
cultivating beans and peas in
sufficient quanities and making
them a part of the diet through
out the winter months, or until
such Jime'as fresh beans or peas
can be raised. If this is done
the disease will be prevented,
cured and m time eradicated.
It is nothing short of suicidal
for the people of the state not to
consistently observe these prev
entive and curative measures,
especially is this true when it is
a question of- eradicating a dis
ease which at present is exact
ing an twful toll upon human
life. -

Net Results of Two Conventions
Chicago, June 10. (By Geo.
Martin, United Press Staff Cor
respondent.) The republic and
progressive national conventions,
held in a solution H2-0 here
since .Wednesday, were finally dis
solved Saturday night.
Between them they have cost
the United States supreme court
its whiskers and 10,000 active
participants about $3,500,00 div
idend like this:
A million five hundred thous
and dollars worth of delegates
alternates and hangers- on, fig
uring 4,000 delegates and alter
nates and enough political kittle-
cattle to make a total of 7,500.
At an average of $200 for rail-,
road fare and living expenses
for a week, this makes the
million and a half total.
A million dollars worth of
newspaper men, magazine writ
ers, journalists and correspond
ents. This includes their living
expences and their news gather
ing arrangements.
Six hundred thousand dollars
worth of woman's party delgeates
alternates and visitors, with their
expence divided about the same
way.
Chicago gave a hundred
thousand dollars towards general
convention fexpences, and the
hotel men, society folks and gen
eral public have spent enough
to bring . the grand total well
within the bounds of conserva
tive estimate.
The net result is two busted
gavels, several busted booms,

Rises !o Position
of National
Prominence
'The presence in the United States
at this time of Pr. Mary Stone, prin
cipal of Danrorth Memorial- Hospital,
Kukiang, China, brings afresh into
public interest the story of the re
markable woman, who from obscurity
has risen to apposition of national
prominence and international reputa
tion. The daughter of pastor Stone,
one of the earliest Christian converts
in Kukiang, she was the first Chinese
girl in Central and ' West China to
grow up with unbound feet. "Big foot
ed'" they call her, and the parents
felt no email anxiety lest, because of
that fact, they should be unable to get
a "mother-in-law" tor her.
But better things than a moiher-in-law
(by no nitv.ns always an unmixed
blcssintj in China) were In store for
Mary Stone. Miss Gertrude Ilowe, a
Methodist miss fbnary became dt-rply
Interested in the little giij and took
her education In hand. When a mis
sionary ho.pital ai opened in Ku
kiang! Mary's father took her to tiie
doctor in charge and. a.cked that she
be taught medicine. The doctor glad
ly consented and for some years the
girl studied there, proving a remarka
bly apt pupil.
At the age of .nineteen, through the
agency of Miss Howe, the ambitious
girl cumo to America and entered up-

on a fuur year medical course in the
University of Michigan from which
she graduutcd with high honors in
1898. Returning at once to Kukiang,
he began within four days a work
that soon developed into the splendid
.veil-equipped Daaforth Memorial Hos
pital, where she has sinco labored,
quietly, unostentatiously, but with rare
skill mid wonderful results, reaching
annually about twenty-five thousand
patients. A Chicagc physician having
observed her work, said, "She is per
forming the most difficult operations
inown to surgery.''
In addition to her heavy medical
and surgical piactice, Dr. Stone con
ducts a nurse-training school, for
which she translates text books; does
active evangelistic work; speaks and
writes as occasion offers; is a mem
ber" of the China Continuation Com
mittee; is president of the National
W. C. T. U. of China; and also main
tains a charming, hospitable Chris
tian home, where she cares for four
i,right, energetic little people, her
adopted children. Mary Stone is a
radiant illustration of what a Chris
tian Chinese woman can be and do.
H is no wonder that she is the ideal
of the more enlightened girlhood of
China.
From Bleeding Mexico
Miss Elizabeth Streater, an Indepen
dent missionary who, through all the
throes of the Mexican revolution, has
remained at the post In Guadalajara,
writes aa follows about conditions "In
that section:
"We have bad the horrors and In
conveniences of many months of war
in this state; but the Constitutional
ists' government Is making good here,
and conditions are much more favor
able now. I believe the revolution
baa opened tbe way for the gospel as
nothing else could have done. People
rre breaking away from old forms and
superstitions, but free thought and in
fidelity are making headway. An evan
gelistio campaign would no doubt,
have wonderful results. Our greatest
need Just now Is workers, native and
foreign."

His Treatment
is Remarkable
Ex-Passenger Agent for North
ern Pacific Discusses Former
Trouble. -
Nearly everybody in Knoxville
especially the railroad people,
know Captain F. S. Patty, for
twelve years district passenger
agent for the Northern Pacific
railroad, with local offices in
Chattanooga and general offices
in St. Paul, Minn.
On account of generally fail
ing health Captain Patty was
forced to discontinue active
work and for the past few years
has been making his home in
Knoxville. where he numbers
his friends by his acquaintances.
He is a kind, genial gentleman
of the old school and is beloved
by all who knew him. The folloing
interesting statement was made
by him in person to the Tanlac
representative:
"I am 69 years old and always
enjoyed good health up to about
six years ago, when I suffered a
nervous breakdown and my gen
eral health gradually failed me.
My principal trouble was indi
gestion and cartarrh, but my
whole system seemed to be out
of shape. My condition finally
got so bad I couldn't sleep at
night and always after eating
I would suffer so from indiges
tion and heart burn that I felt
just like there was a coal of fire
in my stomach. My hearing
and vision were also affected. I
consulted several doctors here in. ',
Knoxville and other cities and
they helped me considerably and
I finally got so I could go around
but somehow I just couldn't feel"
right and could not sleep at
night, which made me awfully
nervous and nothing I would eat
seemed to agree with me.
"I began reading about thi3
Tanlac when you first came
here, but did net decide to try
the medicine until I talked with
a friend of mine who had actual-
y used it. He said it was the
best thing he had ever taken,
and that' was sufficient proof for
me.
"I have just finished the first
and came here this morning, not
only to buy the second bottle,
but to tell you just what it has
done for me. I began enjoying
my meals from the first few
drops. My nervousness is gone
and I can sleep like a child and
aiways wake up in the morning
ready for breakfast and feeling
refreshed. . I am very fond of
onions, but was almost afraid, to
eat them," because they always
disagreed with me so; I ate. one
for dinner the other day and it
agreed with me perfectly and I
had no bad effects whatsoever.
I tell you I am begining to fee
like a different man and am go
ing to keep this Tanlac on hand.
It has done me more good than
anything else in the medicine
line I have ever taken. I cer
tainly do recommend it to my
friends. It is really remarkable."
