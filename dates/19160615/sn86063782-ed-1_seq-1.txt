Louisiana For Vice President
Chicago.?Charles E. Hughes and
Theodore Roosevelt, both of New ,
York, were nominated for President ^
by the Republican and Progressive off
conventions at 12:49 and 12:47 o'clock
Saturday, respectively, the Roosevelt
nomination beating the Hughes nomination
by exactly two minutes.
Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana Fa
was nominated fqr Vies President on
the Republican ticket and John M. ^
Parker of Louisiana on the Progres- Fa
lve. The Hughes nomination was a
na!
made on the third ballot of the con- '
mc
vention, the Roosevelt nomination by
acclamation.
tio
Colonel Roosevelt sent a tentative
declination of the nomination, with .
the understanding that it was to stand jjt)
If Hughes turned out to be sound on m8
the issues of Americanism and pre- ge<
paredness, and that if Hughes turned Jt
out to be pactiflstic, pussy-footed, or gir
pro-German he would accept and tal
make the race as the Progressive canaidate.
Justice Hughes broke all records by 6tr
accepting the nomination by telegraph, wh
( without waiting for a formal notiflca- 0f
tion by the regularly appointed com- an:
mlttee, and declared his position not tal
only on the issues regarded by Col- the
onel Roosevelt as the test Issues, but ed]
also'on the other principal questions C{8
raised by the Republican platform. be<
Jggg tinm a third telegram, this ve^
"! ffittfTiyi'fTliWfe the
Hl^^^^Vice Pre"^?^%l nomination, was anticipated,
because he already had sent ]
a private one to that effect, but, in- 77
Btead, he accepted over the telephone. 66,
The Conference Committee scheme Ro
failed because the Republicans would ba
name no candidate. At the last minute, W;
after every effort to induce them to do inf
so had proved Ineffective, Colonel
Roosevelt himself proposed union on '
Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. Bu
The two Conference Committees so Sh
reported, but the Progressive Conven- ml
tion laid the telegram on the table Br
and the Republicans paid no attention 1,
to It. W]
The nominating ballot showed this
count: ]
Hughes 949 1-2; Roosevelt 18 1-2; Lo
Lodge 7; Du Pont 5; Weeks 3; La- Fo
Follette 3; absent 1. Total 987. ?
Although Frank H. Hitchcock let
It be known that the Hughes men
wanted Burton for second place,
Ohio withdrew Burton's name, leaving
the field to Mr. Fairbanks and
former Secretary Burkett of Nebraska.
The ballot for Vice President show
ed this count:
Fairbanks 863; Eurkett 108; Borah
8; Burton 1; Johnson 1, absent, scattering

Leaders Seen Satisfied.
At 2:01 p. m. the convention ad- m
Journed. There were expressions of
harmony from all the leaders and li
among the delegates. The delegations I I
which on the final ballot had cast H
votes for others than Mr. Hughes |||
made statements declaring their loy gl
alty to the nominees. :J
"Six months ago," said Chairman ;
Hilles of the National Committee, "I EL
?? said a nominee would be born in the ra
convention, and he was." Eg
"I am very much pleased, of course," |
said Mr. Hitchcock. "It means a re |
unfted Republican party and victory |
In November."
Favorite Sons Withdrew. $
When the convention began business
shortly before noon the withdrdwfti
of the fa\orlte sons was an
nounced one after another and the ?
votes began flopping into the Hughes R(
column in solid blocks so rapidly that
the nomination plainly was assured
before the roll call had gone Ave
states. When it got to Colorado the ve
drift was so apparent that a proposal tic
to make it unanimous was made, but
Chairman Harding ruled that the bal he
loting should take its regular course, co
Greeted By Yells. no
Each additlou to the Hughes col- tic
umn was greeted by yells of exulta- an
tion from the rapidly accumulating
Hughes delegates aud steadily state by pli
state the votes piled up until New thi
Jersey carried it past the required ha
494 and the remainder was only a
formality. ce
In rapid succession as the vote went of
on Du Pont was withdrawn by Del- ell
aware and his solid block was cast tin
^ for Hughes; Illinois withdrew Sherman;
Ohio withdrew Burton; Iowa dii
withdrow Cummins; New York with co
drew Root; Massachusetts withdrew he
Weeks. Practically all of these new re
votes were cast for Hughes, only a ha
few remaining in compliment te "Jhe no

\fter Chairman Harding had offi- 1
,lly announced the nomination of 1
irbanks, the usual resolutions were

adjourned.
Notable Convention.
The convention was notable in poIcal
history for many things. A
m who had steadfastly refused to
;k the nomination had been chosen;
was the first Republican convention
ice 1888 which had been forced to
ce more than one ballot to agree
on a candidate, and it had been
irked by a lack of riotous demonatlon
and nervous enthusiasm
itch hitherto had been a feature
such gatherings. It did not touch
y of the existing records for susned
demonstrations, but despite
? fact that it was wholly and decidy
"unbossed;" It moved with a prelon
and quietness which had not
m equalled since the McKlnley conation
tn-Philadelphia. 4^^.

PRESIDENT WILSON
DRAFTS PLATFORM
TO BE ADOPTED BY DEMOCRATIC
NATIONAL CONVENTION AT
8T. LOU 18.
HONOR AND PEACE FOR U.S.
Keeping America Out of War and at
8ame Time Maintaining National
Honor Will Be Foundation of Foreign
Affaire Plank.
Washington.?The outcome of the
Administration's efforts to keep the
United States out of war, and at the
same time maintain the national
honor, will be the foundation of the
foreign affairs plank and one of the
emphasized points in the platform to
be adopted by the Democratic National
Convention at St. Louis, accordirftt
to authoritative information ot>
tallied irom Administration sources.
As a result of conferences with
members of his cabinet and other ad vlsers,
President Wilson, who personally
began work several days ago on
a platform to be submitted to the convention
by party leaders, virtually
has completed a preliminary draft,
leaving only details to be finished
after the Republican and Progressive
Conventions at Chicago. The President
has utilized as a basis for this
work features of the Missouri State
Democratic platform, which was prepared
under the direction of the
White House.
Following out this idea, it is understood
that the national platform will
declare, the success of the admlnlstra
tlon in guarding the honor and interests
of the United States in the faoe
of obstacles, and at the same time
keeping the nation at peace. The ad
ministration's championship against
all belligerents of the rights of America
and all neutrals on the high seas
will be praised, with the statement
that the results will be of great importance
to American commerce.
The Mexican situation will be reion
in ordering troops across the bor
der after the Columbus massacre. .
Another section is expected to laud
tho administration for maintaining
the Monroe Dootrine and fostering
fair dealing with the other Republics
of the Western Hemisphere, resulting
in the building up of trade with thosa
nations.
Finally, It is understood, the foreign
affairs plank will align the party behind
the President in placing "Ameri
ca-first" with reference to all quel
tlons, both international and domestic
The tariff is expected to be the
subject of an important plank, the
platform 'combining the Underwood
revision with the currency law and
other constructive legislation of the
past four years in a prosperity declaration.
President Wilson's preparedness
program will occupy another
prominent place in the platform.
WINTER WHEAT CROP
300,000,000 BUSHELS LESS
Insects, Reduced Acreage and Late
Wet Spring Cause of Reduction.
Washington. ? Present indication#
point to a wheat crop of 300,000,000
bushels emaller than last year. Department
of Agrloulture forecasts indicated
a winter wheat orop of 489,000,000
bushels, 30,000,000 bushels leas
than forecast from May 1 conditions,
due largely to insects in Kansas and
Oklahoma and a Bpring wheat crop
of 246,000,000 bushels, due to a decrease
of 8 per cent in the acreage
from last year and to the late wet
spring.
Crop conditions Tune 1 indicated
less production of small grain crops,
but they promise to be' about the same
as the average produotioc for the last
five years. Fruit orops are good.
Judications are that the crop will be
about 300,000,000 bushels smaller than
last year, being partloularly poor in
most Southern 8tates.
VIOLENT OANNONADING
CONTINUE8 ON MEU8E
Paris.?The official communication
issued by the war office reads:
"On the left bank of the Meuee
the artillery activity was maintained
with intensity In the sector of hill 804
and the reaon of Chattanoourt
"On the right bank the enemy
after avlolent bombardment, directed
successive attacks against our positions
west and east of the Thlaumont
farm. All these attacks failed under
our artillery and maohlne gun Are."
RUSSIANS TAKE CAPTIVB
11,000 MORE AU8TRIAN8.
Petrograd, via London.?The capture
of Luisk In Volhynla and also of
a series of powerfully organized Austrian
positions is announced In an official
communication given out. In addition
to the 40,000 Austrlans previously
captured In the offensive movement
recently inaugurated, the statement
says there were captured In
yesterday's fighting 58 officers and
11,000 men. A large amount of war
material also was takgu.
W. T.'THRO WEB
Capt. W. T. Thrower, of our town,
is in the race for Railroad Commissioner,
I have known Capt. Thrower
for years, and I know he is alright.
He has bad experience in railroad
work and largely on account of that
experience be was successful, as a
representative of the Cheraw board of
trade, In securing for his home town,
Cheraw, cheap rates from the railroads.
y
Capt. Thrower has never been in
politics and is no politician, but if the
people want a* business man, one who
has given rate making a careful study,
now is their chance, and we hope every
Chesterfield county voter will give
him their vote at the approaching primary.
The Fort Mill Times, of York county,
June 15, says?"W. F. Stevenson,
of Cheraw, who was a visitor in Fort
Mill Friday, has filed his pledge with
the secretary of state as a candidate
for Congress from the Fifth Congressional
district. D. E. Finley, the incumbent,
has not yet filed his pledge."

RUSSIANS JHAKE
DECIDED GAINS
DRIVE ENEMY BACK FIPT1IN
MILES IN FIVE DAY8 OF
FURIOU8 FIGHTING.
CRUMPLE OPPONENTS' LINE
From KoveU8arny Railway to Bukowlna
Auatriarla Lift and German
Right Turned In Lutak Ssotor Dy
Gunfire Sweeping Carrier.
Pet no gr ad, via London.?Five days
of furious offensive by the forces of
General Brusslloff has crumpled their
opponents' lines from the Kovel-Sarny
Railway line to Bukowina, driving ,
them back an average of 15 miles.
In the Lutsk sector the Russians appear
to have completely broken
through, turning the lel|t flank of the
Austrian armies and the right flank
of the German jorcee and capturing
Lutsk, the center of a number of radiating
roads and railways. At several
points the attacking Russians
have crossed the Ikwa and Styr Rivers
and further south they are approaching
the Strlpa River. .
The victories are attributable largely
to the avalanche of gunfire which
swept away dozens of lines of entanglements
and opened the way for the
troops, who swept through In inresistible
numbers. In some places tb
Russian barrier fire cut off large Austrian
units, which surrendered. This
accounts for the large number of
prisoners officially reported i iptured.
The operation began In the vicinity
of Olyka, where skirmishing has been
frequent lately. Both aides appeared
to have been feeling for a weak spot
In their opponents' line. The Russian
advance from this point, whloh
is 25 miles from Lutsk, was accomplished
in two and one-half days. During
the long period of Inactivity the
Austrian* constructed strong fortifications
In this section. The tocography
of the country also formed strong n*t?
oral -defenses.
Military observers regard the operation
as an "f?r-"-~?r ?? , |
achievement and emphasize the able
leadership of Geuerafl Brusslloff, who V
conducted the Carpathian campaign
and made a record for prisoners, guns v
and munitions captured.
Lutsk Is an Important link,
strengthening the conectlon between
the southwestern region and the
northern section, and the possession
of It by the Russiana,ls regarded as a
valuable step toward the recapturing
of lost territory. The possession of
Lutsk is a direct menace to Lemberg,
upon which place the Austrlans now
are massing their forces.
