J. S. Mullen, president of the Cham-
b(r oj Commerce, called the meeting
to order and stated the object in a
few well chosen words. He an
nounced that the people had come
together to do, rather than talk, and
speeches were limited to two min
utes. Lee Crure took the floor and
explained the investment features of
the hotel, and his talk was spirited.
P. C. Dings made a brief talk and
turned in his subscription, -which
started the ball to rolling. Judge
Freeman made a talk that put the
crow(i to laughing and aroused fur-
ther enthusiasm. O. C. Lasher, act
ing mayor, called attention to the
wonderful growth of the city along
all lines, and pointed out the need
of a hotel. Walter S. Gilbert talked
from the standpoint of the salaried
man and said labor was looking to
Ardmore to make good and was will
ing to help. Mayor Mullen said he
would give all he could borrow, and
he was unalterably for improvements
in all lines in the city. Charles von
Weise touched the crowd when he
told of having gone to Chicago, and
was assigned to a small, dingy room.
There was not even a bowl and
pitcher in his room. He called up
the clerk to make protest. The clerk
looked over the register and saw he
was from""" Ardmore. He then told
Mr. von Weise that he was the last
man In the world to kick, because he
came from a town without a hotel.
He pleaded for the hotel for prestige.
His speech provoked laughter and
led to a business view of the situa
tion. His was the last speech before
the subscription taking began.
It is certain that Ardmore will meet
the requirements and the hotel will
be built.

Temporary Chairman Glynn
called the convention to order
today for the second day's ses
sion at 11:46. The permanent
officers were immediately ap
pointed and permanent chair
man Ollie James started his
speech. He wal interrupted by
an eighteen-minute demonstra

from the printed text ot his speech,
but the sentiment he presented was
substantially the same. When James

GERMANS AFTER

CONTINUE VIOLENT BOMBARD
MENT NORTH OF SOUVILLE
RUSSIANS CLAIM SEA VICTORY
OVER GERMANS.
The Cermans are continuing their
violent bombardment of the French
positions north of Souvllle, which are
the key to the inner defenses at Ver.
dun, a French official statement said
today.
The Russian' troops attacked the
German lines near Przewloka, but
were repulsed, the German office
says, adding that the Austrian troops
in Bukowina are making a stand
north of Czernowitz and are holding
the Russians east of the city. The
Russian attacks are said to have been
repulsed.
Russians Win Sea Battle.

peated the statement and the crowd
rose and broke loose with cheers.
In repeating a phrase from his pre
pared speech, the senator said:
"Woodrow Wilson, without orphaning
a single child, uithout widowing a
single American mother, without fir
ing a single gun, without shedding
a single drop of blood, . wrung from
tlie most" militant spirit that was
ever brooded over a battlefield, an
agreement to the American demands
and a concession of American rights."
The band swung into "America,"
and "The Star Spangled Uanner.'
Hats and flags went into the air.
Someone cried "Three cheers for
Wilson." The crowd roared its an
swer. Stanchions were torn from the
floors and the march of the delegates
through the hall started. Aisles be
came choked because the demonstra
tion was begun without an organized
leadership. The congestion, however,
aided In shortening the demonstra
tion. The band played "A Hot Time"
as a marching tune, while James
fanned his florid face.
. AVhen the demonstration was over,
there were calls for Bryan, but he
had slipped out of the press gallery
during' the demonstration and could
not be found. '
Jerry C. South, a delegate from
Arkansas,' and clerk of the house of

Cormick of Pennsylvania has been
selected by Wilson to succeed Wil
liam MoCombs as chairman of the

RETURNED FROM CONVENTION.
Ardmore Delegate to Chicago Says
Hughes Will Win.
Charles von Weise, who was an
alternate delegate to the Chicago
republican national convention, has
returned from that city, where he
was given a seat In the convention.
Ho gives a most interesting report
of the proceedings. He Is of the
opinion that Hughes will win the
election this fall by a majority of
from a million to a million and a
half voles. After it beeamc known
that Ruiosevelt would not accept the
nomination, It did not require but
fifteen minutes for Roosevelt badges
to disappear and the Hughes badge,
a small red one, broke out like
measles upon the lapels of thousands
of coats of those who hail favored
the progressive party nominee. The
scene was quickly changed from bed
lam for Roosevelt to praiso for
Hughes.
In the republican convention the
mention of 1 lie name of Roosevelt
resulted in applause for forty sec
onds, the name ot Taft brought four
minutes of applause, and twenty-six
minutes of the wildest applause greet
ed the name of Hughes.
In the progressive convention the
meeting was well staged. Men In
rough rider uniform, carrying small
leather horns paraded up and down
the aisles, speaking through these
horns the words "We want Teddy."
They were professional convention
enthusiasm producers, anil were
there using their skill. They pro
voked much enthusiasm for Itoose
velt, and he was the idol of many
a heart in the convention. But the
moment he declined the nomination,
there was no longer any progressive
party.
While in Chicago Mr. von Weise
attended the automobile derby, where
93,000 people were In attendance and
where seats sold all the way from $1
to $1". The former price was paid
for the bleachers. He saw cars make
a speed of HO miles an hour, he
saw an average speed of more than
100 miles an hour for the first twenty-five
miles and the best speed was
above 98 miles an hour for the full
300-mile race. The track was two
miles in length and it was traversed
130 times to complete the 300-mile
race. One machine going at 80 miles
an hour rolled over without injuring
the driver. Tires were frequently
thrown Into the air, and autos had
to go into booths for new tires. The
best speed at putting on new tires
was 27 seconds.
The citizenship of Chicago beauti
fully entertained the delegates. Kv
ery club was open to them, all places
of amusement were free, and 1,700
automobiles were placed at the dis
position of the delegates to be used
at will, and absolutely free of cost.
Chicago did so well that it can with
free grace ask for the convention
again four yearB from now.
Is Here From Fox.
"Uncle Bob" Davis of Fox was in
the city today. He states that the
hailstorm there last Friday night did
a great deal of damage to growing
crops. His barn was badly beaten.
Some of it was in the tassel and the
stalks were so badly beaten that it
cannot make a crop, and is a total
loss.
Frisco Superintendent Here.
"C. II. Baltzell. division superintend
ent of the Frisco, with headquarters
at Fort Smith, is an Ardmore visitor
today.
ATTACK CAVALRY
Laredo, Tex., June 15. One
hundred Mexican bandits
crossing the Kio Grande at 2
o'clock this morning at San Yg
nacio, forty miles southeast of
here, attacked two troops of
the fourteenth cavalry, killing
two and wounding five of the
Americans.
Six Mexicans were found
dead with their clothing wet,
indicating that they had just
forded the river.
Major Gray, commanding
the cavalry, after a half-hour
battle pursued the bandits
south on the American side of
the river and may follow them
into Mexico.
The names of the American
dead could not be learned at
Ft. Mcintosh here, on account
of the lack of wire communica
tion in the district where the
bandits were pursued.
The Mexicans did not try to
raid the town, but made a di
rect and premeditated attack
on the soldiers, expecting to
find a smaller body of troops
than there were. The Mexicans
were dressed in peon garb, but
were exceptionally well armed.
Private Minaden, who was
wounded in the San Ygnacio
fight, died this morning, in
creasing the American dead to
three.
Prominent Villista Captured.
Field Headquarters, June 15. (via
wireless). Colonel Petro Lujan, a

was captured yesterday by a thir
teenth cavalry detachment at 'Hacien
da Tepehaknes. He was a leader in
the Columbus raid.
Has Confidence in Gray.
ISan Antonio, Tex., June 15.
Whether another punitive expedition
enters Mexico depends on Major
Gray's picking up of the train of the
bandits who attacked San Ygtiaclo
early today Funston characterized
the action as "typical De la Rosa tac
ticsa night attack and scattering
like quail."
Funston is confident that Gray has
enough troops to deal with the raid
ers. Reply to Carranza Ready.
Washington, I). C, June 15. Secre
tary Iansing laid before Fresident
Wilson today the completed draft of
the note to General Carranza replying
to his demand that the American
troops be withdrawn. The note won't

stood that the note flatly denied the
withdrawal of troops until Carranza
shows he can control the situation.
