CHAS. HUGHES CHOSEN
TO LEAD REPUBLICANS
Justice Immediately Resigns
From Bench Wires Ring
ing Acceptance. Roose
velt to Support Him
Chas. Hughes etaoin Page 1 Col 1
The Republican National convention
adjourned at 2:02 Saturday afternoon,
after being in session four days. The
principal work of the day was the
nomination of Fairbanks for vice
president. Immediately folowing the
adjournment of the convention Jus
tice Hughes accepted the nomination
and resigned from the supreme court.
He threw off his judicial dignity and
beamed at the reporters as he shook
their hands. Justice Hughes received
the news in his library and immediate
ly started dictating his acceptance
and also a statement for the press.
The official result of today's ballot
gives Hughes 949 1-2; Roosevelt 18 1-2
Lodge 7; Dupont 5; Weeks 3; LaFol
lette 3; absent 1, making a total of
987. Hughes' nomination was made
unanimous. Every name but Roose
velt's was withdrawn,. and Chairman
Harding immediately wired Hughes
congratulations as follows:
. "With deliberation and enthusiasm
under the circumstances which could
not have been more complimentary
and with unanimity, never excelled
during the past conventions, you have
been nominated by the Republicans of
the nation as their candidate for pres
ident of the United States."
Mr. Hughes immediately resigned
"his position as Associate Justice of the
Supreme court.
The Right Man
Charles E. Hughes is the right man
lor president, says the Las Vegas Op
tic. The republican national conven
tion so decided Saturday, and' the Am
erican people will make a similar de
cision next November. Mr. Hughes
as a member of the United States
Supreme court, could not becomingly
give voice to utterances that might be
, s construed in any way as criticising the
administration in Washington, and
thej public did not know, until after
his nomination and his resignation
from his high place in the judiciary,
what his position is in regard to cer
tain pressing problems, national and
international.
Mr, Hughes' telegram accepting the
nomination clearly showed him to be
a thorough American, qualified to
lead Americans. His position regard
ing the protection of American citi
zens everywhere, his views regarding
preparedness, both military and in
dustrial, and his ideas concerning the
restoration of an adequate protective
tariff I will strike a responsive chord in
the heart of the nation. Proper reg
ulation of big business, but with due
regard for justice and right, is one of
Mr. Hughes' ideas, and his entire pro
gram (is based upon that variety of
logic that appeals to the American
public' as "squaredealism."
Mr. Hughes' statement of his posl
tion could not have been more suit
able to the convictions of the progres-
sives had they written it themselves,
and at the same time it is thoroughly
republican. Undoubtedly the Hughes
candidacy will unite firmly the two
factions of the republican party. It
will have a strong appeal, too, for the
independent voter, who wishes to see
the United States respected among the
company of nations; who wishes to see
a firm policy inaugurated regarding
Mexico; who wishes to see internation
al problems correctly solved, and
handled firmly and consistently; who
wishes to se prosperity based upon a
firmer foundation than the sufferings
of other nations.
It looks mighty favorable, right
now, for a Hughes victory.
Colonel Roosevelt
If Colonel Roosevelt perseveres in
his determination not to divide the re
. publican ranks by accepting the pro
gressive nomination for president, he
will prove to the country that he has
been sincere in his statements regard
ing the ills of the nation and their
cure. If the colonel, leaves the field
to Hughes and Wilson, throwing his
support to the republican nominee
with his promises of restoring a pol
icy of firmness, and opposing the con
tinuance of a policy of weakness, he
will be regarded as the country's best
American. And the indications are
that that is just what he will do.
Clayton Woman's Brother Murdered
C A. Rutledge left Monday on the
noon train for East Vaughn, N. M.,
in response to a message Monday
morning stating that a man had been
murdered at that place and in his
pocket was found a card addressed to
Carson A. Rutledge at Clayton, N. M.
The message was received by Atty.
Joseph Gill, who remembered that Mr.
Rutledge had a brother-in-law visit
ing him who took the train Saturday
for points in Arizona. He started for
the Rutledge ranch about fourteen
miles out and got Mr. Rutledge back
in time to take the noon train.
Mr. Rutledge was quite certain, that
the murdered man was his brother-in-law
and he returned in the car with
Mr. Gill to take the train for El Paso.
The boy whose name was Strickland,
came last week to visit his sister as a
surprise to her. He was about
eighteen years old. He was champion
High school wrestler of the state of
Nebraska, and had just recovered
from a severe illness. He was seek
ing both health and pleasure and stop
ped off here on his way to Arizona,
where he intended to spend the sum
mer. Why he stopped at East Vaughn
N. M. or any motive whatever for his
murder, cannot even be conjectured.
He was well dressed but had very lit
tle cash on his person. His sister is
almost prostrated over his tragic end
Mr. Rutledge returned yesterday
from Dalhart and gives us the report
that his brother-in-law, Vincent Strick
land, arrived in East Vaughn, at mid
night Sunday. He stayed in the de
pot the rest of the night waiting for
the Santa Fe train south. He, in
company with three Americans and
two Spanish-Americans were standing
on the platform watching the north'
bound train pull out when the old night
watchman for the railroad company
walked up to him, stuch a six shooter
in his right tide and fired. The bullet
went through his body and came out
near his heart. It was discovered that
he had been robbed of his watch, ticket
and purse containing $25. The boy
evidently had not discovered that he
had been robbed.
The old man whose name is Seela,
who shot him, is supposed to be insane
as he has had domestic trouble, his
wife being in the insane asylum for
the past six years and he having four
children to look after. Seela is about
56 years of age but appears much
older. He was arrested and his trial
comes up Monday next.
Young Strickland has been sent to
Iowa for burial.
CHrr'ie Wherrit Injured
Little Charlie Wherrit had a most
painful accident Friday afternoon of
last week, which may prove to be real
ly serious. While playing m his
fathers shop, he pulled an eighty
pound box of lemons over which fell
on top of him pinning him to the
floor. His back was injured and he
seemed to be paralyzed. To just what
extent his injuries reach, is not
known. Mrs. Wherrit left Sunday
afternoon with him for Denver, where
she will place him under the care of
a specialist.
Hail Won't Stop Beans
J. M. Hanson and H. D. Pembleton
had their crops very badly damaged
Sunday by the rain and hail, which
visited them. They were experiment
ing with a good many new things in
the way of seeds and this is rather
hard on them since it is too late to do
much replanting of those experiments.
However, they are not at all discour
aged and say they can raise beans if
they can't do anything else.
Jack Lenhart, prosperous cattleman
of the Corrumpa, was in Clayton the
first of the week looking after busi
ness matters.

vThe storm which visited northeast
New Mexico, Sunday afternoon was
really a cloudburst with a terrific ac
companiment of hail. However the
hailstones were not large enough right
in the city to do much damage al
though the trees were deprived of
much lonage.
southwest of town, a great many
houses were either unroofed or had
their tarred coverings riddled like
sieves by the hail. ,The storm contin
ued from five in the afternoon until
about two in the morning.
lhe tdgingtons, living about six
miles out, had the roof blown off both
their houses, while Alvin Alford
shared the same fate. E. E. Hamm
lost his chicken house on the ranch,
and a lot of chickens. H. A. Summers
near the Missouri Valley lost his wind
mill and had his house damaged con
siderably. The concrete bridge over the
renco six miles out of Dalhart was
partly washed out though it has been
patched up until it can be crossed. H.
C. Abbott, Manager of the Farmer's
Development company, lost three hun
dred ewes and about seven hundred
lambs at Mt Dora. The hail there
was reported eight inches deep. John
Otto was in from his ranch Monday
and reported five hundred head of
lambs killed at the shearing sheds. He
did not know of any other Toss at that
time though there were a number of
herds he had not heard from.
The precipitation in the city was
5 of an inch according to the gov
ernment report given us by Dr. Charl
ton.,. He also informs us that there
were only one and three quarters
inches of moisture fell during the en
tire month of May. This is the least
that has fallen for the past nine years,
which is quite remarkable when one
considers the good condition of crops
generally.
Dies From Rattlesnake Bite
Frank Kilburn was called to Des
Moines yesterday to embalm the body
of Wm. Weeks, who was bitten bv a
rattlesnake the latter part of last
week. Funeral services will be held
there today and then the body will be
shipped to Clayton and placed in the
Undertaking parlor for two weeks
when it will be shipped to Illinois for
interment. Mr. Weeks was very pop
ular in Des Moines and his death was
a shock to his wife and friends.
Auto Hits Fence
While Mr. and Mrs. Frank Kilburn
were in Des Moines yesterday, Mrs.
Harmon Fox brdught a man into Dr.
Basset's office who had been thrown
out of his car and very badly hurt. His
face was deeply cut and his teeth were
all loosened and ready to drop out. Dr.
Basset dressed his wounds. They were
caused by his hitting a wire fence
where the road had been closed up and
not marked plainly.
Mrs. Miller Very III
Mrs. W. A. Miller is reported very
low as we go to press ana her life is
despaired of. Mrs. Miller has not
been very ' strong for some time
but her sudden nearness to death is a
great shock to many of her rfiends.
Houses and Streets to Be Numbered
The city council has decided that in
asmuch as Uncle Sam considers Clay
ton a city of 10,000 whether it is or
not, it is just as well to purchase
name plates for streets and numbers
for houses. This will of course be
come a necessity when the govern

Clayton Now Has Dallas Wire
Ray Holmes, manager of the West
ern Union here, informs us that the
Company will have a direct wire into
Clayton from Dallas and will possib
ly use Dallas or Kansas City as head
quarters giving the people of Clay
ton a direct wire and insuring much
better service which will be welcomed
by the business men here.
Brings Ford From Denver
Carl Dunn and Harry Huhn return
ed Sunday night from Denver with
the new Ford car that Carl purchased
while there. It was very stormy and
muddy and they had to swim several
creeks but "the little old Ford
rambled right along."

Clavton Iniuns' spectacular victory over the Trinidad
Eagles at Trinidad Sunday is
superior generalship of Waters, twiner for Clayton over shoe
maker the Pueblo southpaw. The game traveled for 1 1 in
nings in true big league style

Morton got a walk terminated a really nerve trying suspense
and constituted a finale compared with which the most tense
moment in average amateur
v When we say that it was a pitcher's
duel from start to finish we do not
imply that the boys behind were not
in the game.v While there were five
errors charged to the Clayton lads
they were scattered and had but lit
tle effect on the result. Both, teams
backed the pitchers in encouraging
style and in one or two instances in
errors charged to the Clayton boys
instances McFadden long fast runs in
deep center to pull down Jackson's
long htis and a couple of reckless
stabs at hot ones in short by Kerr,
which shattered the hopes of many a
Trinidad fan.
' Clayton sent an estimable delega
tion of fans to the game and Trinidad
had out a good-sized crowd. The min
ing city has a beautiful park and
above all a comfortable, commodious
grandstand. Each crowd loyally sup
ported their performers but there was
no exhibitions of ill temper on the part
of fans, Trinidad papers spoke most
highly of Clayton "sporting blood"
and complimented the local team on
their showing. There were two un
advertised interruptions in the game
occasioned by showers and hailThey
really served to put the crowd on edge
and make the diamond shipshape.
"To begin with," says the Picket
wire, in writing of the game, "that
lively little burg across the state line,
brought along a beautiful crowd of
rooters. The same teams will
probably furnish the card for the
Fourth at Clayton."
The game by innings
Clayton scored in the first when
Waters singled, Maddox sacrificed,
Lancaster struck out, and Thompson
drew his first counter. Trinidad ev
ened things up in her half when Wood
got on after Thompson dropped his fly
to right. Neill sacrificed and Wood
went out when Kerr took Meanor's
grounder and tossed to Maddox at
third. Meanor stole third and scored
on Jackson's hit.
There was nothing more done in the
score column until the sixth when
Maddox singled and was thrown out
by Shoemaker at second while Lan
caster took the beneficial end of
Wood's high throw to double him at
first. Then Shoemaker threw the ball
to center field in an effort to catch
Lancaster napping and the latter
romped home. This was the run which
hurt as it enabled Clayton to hold
things over for the extra innintf play.
The Eagles tried hard all the' way
and it began to look as if there would
be something doing in the scoring line
when Bryden got on in the eighth on
Kerr's low throw at first. Jackson hit
his second long fly to center .which
McFadden gobbled. Malcom drew
three strikes and Hatchett missed the
third one. He threw wild for first and
Bryden counted.
It was splendid baseball all the way.
In the eleventh, with score still tied
of course, Waters, hitter as well as
pitcher, burned one right into Shoe
maker's hands and was thrown out at
first. Shoemaker hit Maddox and fol
lowed it by walking Morton. Thomp
son hit to Malcolm in right who held

the ball after corralling it and Mad
dox and Morton sailed home and the
Clayton crowd went raving mad.
Moore singled and Thompson scored.
Birdsong hit a high one and went out.
That virtually tells the story.
The entire infield played well for
Trinidad and the Clayton lads looked
as good.

As Seen From The Bleachers
We wonder if it was hunch or good
judgment on the part of Claire Rob
erts? Bawb Thompson should be informed
that when he dropped that fly several
ladies in the grandstand nearly faint
ed. In speaking of, hunches and things
we wonder where Smith, the barber
got his.
McFadden should also be informed
that he nearly caused a riot in the
grandstand when he pulled in that
first long fly.
While Maddox performed like an
old timer iri the game he certainly had
hard luck with his first and only sure
enough fielding chance.
Kerr made some ramdom stabs at
warm ones that could have been
classed as hits but which weren't.
Nobody ever dreamed that Dr. Hay
don could or would make that much
noise over one little old ball game.
The Citizen congratulates Luther
George on securing Waters for the
game. We also tip off to Mr. Waters
the compliments of Clayton fans on
his work Sunday.
