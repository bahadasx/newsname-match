ff
Wilson Will Be Named in Dem
ocratic Convention Tonight
GLYNN STARTS ENTHUSIASM
His Keystone Speech,. Endorsing Wil
son's Conduct of Foreign Affairs
Wins Applause.
St. Louis, June 15. Judge Wescott
of New Jersey stated at noon today
that he would renominate President
Wilson In the democratic national con
vention at 8 o'clock this evening.
The convention waa called to order
at 11.45 this morning. The committee
on credentials made Its report and
Ollie James of Kentucky was made lier
manent chairman.
St. Louis, Mo., Juno 15. The demo
cratic national convention at its first
session yesterday heard the keynote of
Americanism and peace preparedness
and prosperity sounded by former Gov.
Glynn of New York, as temporary
chairman, and registered by demonstra
tion after demonstration its approval
of President Wilson's peaceful con
duct of foreign affairs. The conven
tion, which had gotten under way with
such perfunctory demonstrations as
mark every national gathering of the
kind, soon stirred itself into roaring
cheers as Chairman Glynn cited his
toric parallels to show that other presi
dents, including republicans, had ad
justed threatening foreign situations
without resort to war. "The policy of
the administration," he declared, "has
been just as American as the American
flag itself." As he went down the list
of presidents, lecounting their actions
to avoid war, the delegates caught the
spirit of his argument and as he re
ferred to each particular president
some delegate would call: "What did
he do?"
"He settled the trouble by negotia
tion," was the reply which Glynn in
variably returned and the convention
would roar its approval.
William J. Bryan, as a newspaper
correspondent in the press stand, wept
with emotion 83 Glynn pictured the
victories of peace, but he laughed
with the crowd when a Texas dele'
Kate, interrupting Glynn, leaped to
his chair and cried: "And don't for
get the policy also is satisfactory to
William Jennings Hryan."
Aside from a 16-minute demonstra
tion which began when Chairman
Glynn predicted President Wilson's re
election, Glynn's speech was sprinkled
with demonstrations which he found
It difficult to stem so that he could
go on. It was plain that the telling
points on the delegates were the r
cital of President Wilson's efforts to
kept the country at peace.
"This policy," ho said, "may not
satisfy the fire-eater and the swash
buckler. Put It does satisfy t he-
mothers of the land at whoso hearts
and flresldo no Jingoistic war ha
placed nn empty clinir. It does tmtis
fy the daughters of this land ! from
whom bluster and brag have sent no
living blether to tne resolution of the
grave. It does satisfy the fathers of
this land and tho sons of the land who
will fight for our flarr and Ulo for our
flag when reason priiues tho rifles
when honor draws the sword,- and
when Justice breathes a blessing on
the standard they uphold." Tii lu.it
of tho words were drowned out In a
roar of applause that swept the
Coliseum. "Repeat It," cried the dele
gates; "repeat It." "All right, be quiet
and I'll repeat it," responded Glynn
and he did to applause and cheering.
No other president since Lincoln,
Glynn told the delegates, had faced
such crucial problems, none had dis
played a grtiBp of statesmanship more
profound. "Whether the courso tho
country has pursued during this cm
clal period Is to be continued and
wheMier the principles that have been
asserted as aur national policy shall
be Indorsed or withdrawn," Glynn told
tho convention, was the paramount
question for the voters to decide.
Afier hearing tho keynote (speech
the convention adjourned until ll
o'clock this morning. Committees
then went Into session to prepare their
work for the session.
Conferences among leaders which
have followed tho arrival of Secretary
Maker with firsthand words from
President Wilson on many features of
the declaration of principles brought
the status of tho democratic platform
Inst night to a point where, aside from
the nll-iinporlant issue of foreign uf
fairs, it stood substantially as follows:
No specific mention would be made
of Mexico and that subject would be
covered by Implication In general
decorations outlining relations of the
United States with oilier governments.
This portion of the nlatform would do
claro unequivocally for tho right of
every nation to regulate Its own In
ternal offalrs and would point out that
this government would bo satisfied
with nothing less for Itself. -nights

erentc . Res of partiality to tne
entente ' , and would point out
that questions involving not lite, but
only property, can be settled by in
demnity and reparation when the pas
sions of war have subsided.
A permanent peace tribunal would
be advocated in one of the platform
planks as a court of arbitral justice
to which all disputes between nations
should be referred. How far the plat
form may reflect the president's re
cent declaration of willingness to have
the United States join a world league
to enforce peace by a common police
force is not yet determined.
While the platform would deal with
the peaceful settlement of disputes
between nations, it would be out
spoken in its declarations that the
navy should be of proportions and ef
ficiency to make effective the Monroe
doctrine, and that the standing army
should be of sufllcient strength to se
cure the country against unexpected
aggression. The platform, in the
same connection, would declare for a
sufficient reserve force to secure the
nation against invasion and aggres
sion at all times. Coupled with this
declaration lor a strong army and
navy would be a straightforward pro
nouncement against all wars of ag
grandizement and against violations
of territorial aggression. This would
be intended as a declaration to the
world that the United States, as the
foremost spokesman for peace and
judical settlement of disputes, makes
Its military preparations not for ug
gresslon but for defense.
Touching internal questions, the
platform would declare for an eight-
hour day for working men, and also
civil service pensions with a declara
tion that the government should care
for those upon 'whom it depends to
man its operating machinery. One
plank would deal with child labor and
another would advocate legislation In
the interest of labor in all government
Institutions.
In several succeeding planks the
legislative record of the administra
tion would be set forth, with refer
ences to the federal reserve law, the
trade commission bill, the shipping
bill, the tariff bill, rural credits legis
lation and other measures passed by
Congress or now .being pressed by tho
administration. Then the platform
would contain a definite pronounce
ment that when the program now
under way is completed there will be
no more legislation which the business
world could regard as restraining, in
short, business would be promised a
i est from congressional interferences.
The draft as Secretary Baker car
ried it from the White Hnupp made nn
claims for general approval of the
president's course for "peace prosperi
ty, but President Wilsons trlentls in
St. iouis are Insistent that the plat
form would not be complete without
strons presentment on that point, and
Senator H listing of Wisconsin was as
signed to prepare a plank, with the
suggestion that it bo drafted In terms
sufficiently strong to make it one of
the keynotes of the campaign. The
enthusiastic manner in which the con
vention yesterday received Temporary
Chairman Glynn's speech of justilica
tion of the president's policies in keep
ing the country at peace has lent force
to this plan.
A plank on woman suffrage which
was suggested ty the president him
self probably will be redrafted. Some
of the resolutions committeemen
thought it might be regarded as not
Hiifliclcntty di'llnite. Indications lust
night were that the plunk will be
not unlike the republican plank, recog
nizing the right of sulfrage for women
but holding to the light of the states
to regulate the ballot themselves
President Wilson has repeatedly stated
his position in that way to suffrage
leaders, and in the New Jersey elec
Hons last year voted for the suffrage
amendment which was beaten.

President Throws Down Gage to
Hyphenated Americans Who Are
Opposing His Re-election.
Washington, June 13. A charge that
some foreign-born citizens of tho Unit
ed States are trying to levy political
blackmail and to undermine the In
fluence of the national government was
made by President Wilson In a flag-day
speech yesterday. His a;;sertion
sounded tho keynote of one of the
foremost Issues on which he will go
before the country for re-election,
and touched upon a platform declara
tion which will be submitted by the
adininistiation to the St. "Louis con
vention.
The president spoke before a crowd
of thousands gathered at the foot of
the Washington monument, after he
had reviewed for live hours a great
preparedness parade, at the head of
which he himself had matched down
Pennsylvania avenue. He declared
that not since the civil war had it
been tested as it now is being tested
whether the stars and strips stood
for any one united purpose.
There is disloyalty : ctive in the
United States and it must be abso
lutely crushed," declared the presi
dent, speaking emphatically. "It pro
ceeds from a minority, a very small
minority, but a very active and subtle
minority.
"It works underground, but it also
shows its ugly head where we can see
it- and there are those at this mo
merit who are trying to levy a species'
of blackmail, saying, 'Do what we
wish in the interest of foreign sent!
ment or we will wreck our vengeance
at the colls.' That is the sort of
thing against which the American
nation will turn with a might and
trimuph of sentiment which will teach
these gcatlcmen once for all th?t loy
alty to this flag Is the first test of
tolerance In the United States."
The president's words were taken
as ail open challenge to foreign-born
Americans who, lie had learned from
foreign-language newspapers and oth
er sources, are opposing him for re
election. Officials close to him said
he was outlining his stand on what
he had determined to make a predom
inant issue in this campaign.
PROGRESSIVES' POSITION
National Committeemen to Find Out
Sentiment of the Party
Burlington, June 14. Dr. II. Nelson
Jackfcn, national committeeman of the
Progressive party lor the State of Ver
mont, arrived in this city from Chicago
early yesterday morning. To a Free
Press reporter, who inquired Just what
the Progressive party Intended doing,
Dr. Jackson stated that after the pro
gressive convention a meeting of the
national committee was called. The
committee organized and practically
appointed the same ollkers and the
executive committee. It was decided
that each committeeman should p,o
back to his State and call the lead
ers of the Progressive party together,
consult with them and find out just
what their wishes are for future plana
and, as per Colonel Roosevelt's rues
sage to the convention, they are to
meet again In Chicago on June 2(5 to
consult with him. This is the only of
ficial statement that Dr. Jackson would
give out as he strongly feels Hint he is
simply a servant of his party and must
consult with them here before any
thing cfliclally can be given for publica
Hon.
Dr. Jackson was then asked how ho
felt personally regarding the present
conditions, lie stated that he has
always been a Roosevelt admirer from
first to last and that Colonel Roose
velt's attitude now in the matter was
Just what he would expect from him;
that the colonel would always take his
country Into consideration belore he
would his personal desires and nmbl
ticm:.
The doctor was naked what In
thought of Justice Hughes and he stat
ed that his only hope now was that he
would be able to control votes enough
to beat Wilson, and that Wilson was go
ing to be a mighty hard man to beat
"There was talk In Chicago," said I)r
Jackson, "that Henry Ford was going
to hack Hryan with his millions and
that a new party would be formed with
nrynn ns president and Mr. l ord as
vice-president and that their Issue
would be peace nnd temperance. Con
ditlotm in St. Louis this week ought to
tell that story."
"Do you think Colonel Roosevelt
will bo forced to run by the progres
sives?" was then asked of the doctor,
and he personally stated that tinder
our present nntlonnl conditions he did
CZEMIOIIZ GUT
OFF D
TO SUHIEH
One Report Has It That Austrians
Have Already Evacuated
Environed City
London, June 14. The Russians, con
tiuuing their advance along the whole
southeastern front, from the Pripet
marshes to the Rumanian frontier,
have extended their great offensive to
the northern front, against General
von Hindenburg's army. Attack after
attack was launched today against the
German positions about seventy-five
miles north of Pinsk, and, although
they broke down under the furious fire
of the German guns, it is evident
that they succeeded in placing the
Kaiser's forces in a position that will
preclude any further offensive move
ments on their part for some time to
come.
The movement intended to divert
the Russians from the fighting in the
south has only resulted in further ex
posing the bear'ij claws. The initial
attempt of the Germans to clip them
on only ugly scratches.
The present objective of the Rus
sians on the southern front are Kovel,
Lemberg and Czernowitz. Tonight
the Russian armies are just twenty
five miles from Kovel and forty-eight
miles from Lemberg. They have com
pletely enveloped Czernowltz, cut off
its railway communications from the
north and pressed twenty miles beyond
it toward the heart of the Galician
plains. The fortress-capital of Buko
wina can hold out iu its present iso
lated condition only a few hours.
Nothing but a complete reversal of
conditions along the Galician front can
save Lemberg. Or.e report says that
the city has already been evacuated by
tiio Austrians.
not think the colonel would do It.
"How do you feel regarding the poli
tical situation and what are the results
of jour txpLiivnce in Chicago?" Dr.
Jackson was asked. The doctor's an
swer to this was that just now lie felt
like one of the old-time politicians, who
stated to him in Chicago that the long
er lie was in American politics the
more he became n hero worshipper and
that his three heroes were J. Gould,
because, he stated, "The public, be
damned"; P. T. Larnum, "That the
American people like to be fooled," and
Bismarck, "That words were made to
cover up one's feelings."
"What will lit your next move?" was
asked. He replied as follows:
I wish 1 was a little rock
A sitting on a hill
A doing nothing all day long
But just a sitting still;
I'd never smoke, I'd never drink,
I d never even wash,
I'd nit and sit a thousand years
And rest myself by gosh!

COLONEL'S SUPPORT EXPECTED
Friends Insist That Bull Moose Leader
Will Soon Confer With Republican
Candidate.
New York, June 15. The Roosevelt
Republican Committee, organized to
bring about the nomination of the
Colonel by the Republican convention,
formally indorsed the candidacy of
Charles Evans Hughes yesterday and
called upon "every loyal Republican
and every citizen who believes in
Americanism and preparedness" to
work for his election.
The indorsement came In the form of
a statement presented to Mr. Hughes
by a sub-commit teo of three of the
Roosevelt Republican Committee. The
three, Robert C. Morris, Courtland
Nicol and John ll. Isclin, called at the
Hughes headquarters at the Hotel As-
tor and had a conference w ith the man
thev now hail us leader.
The statement, which was one of the
most pleasing documents that .Mr.
Hughes has seen since his arrival here
Monday morning, follows:
'The Roosevelt Republican Commit
tee was organized to support Colonel
Roosevelt in his advocacy of American
ism and preparedness, and to unite the
Republican party upon him .as its can
didate because of his leadership in the
presentation of these principles. The
Republican National convention has
strongly enunciated thene principles in
its platform, and the committee leels
that the chief purpose of its existence
has been accomplished. Charles Evans
Hughes, the candidate of the Republi
can party, stands upon this platform
and the committee therefore urges
upon every loyal Republican and every
citizen who believes in Americanism
and preparedness to support him.
"The committee has finished Its
work, but its individual members will
give their earnest support to Mr.
Hughes. The committee expresses Its
complete confidence that Mr. Hughes
will be elected to the presidency in No
vember. "George V. L. Meyer,
"Chairman, Roosevelt Republican Com
mittee." None of Mr. Hughes immediate
friends and advisers are worrying over
the failure of Colonel Roosevelt to in
dorse him. They all feel certain that
the Colonel will do this and that it will
not be long before the two meet. One
old friend of the Colonel who called at
Hughes headquarters yesterday said if
Mr. Hughes would name a meeting
place the Colonel would go there and
talk things over.
Mutual friends of tho two are work
ing to bring this about. Rumor credits

CATTLE DEPARTMENT EXPENSES
Commissioner Davis Uses $92,000 Dur
ing Biennial Term.
Burlington, June 13. Twelve thou
sand dollars, received from the sale
of cattle condemned because of bovlno
tuberculosis, has been expended by
Cattle Commissioner Fred L. Davis, in
addition to the biennial appropriation
of $80,000 for this department, in the
past two years for stamping out tuber
culosis and combating the ravages ot
the foot and mouth disease.
Commissioner Davis is paying tho
20 or more veterinarians which he has
employed the past three months and
his expenditures will practically use
up the $92,000 which has been avail
able. The appropriation for the next
fiscal year became available June 1.
But 5 or 6 per cent of the cattle
tested during the biennial period were
found infected. The condemned cat
tle were sold for the most part to the
Burlington Rendering company.
A large item in the expenditures of
the commissioner's department was
the payment to owners for cattle kill
ed. As foot and mouth disease em
bargo has been lifted throughout the
country commissioner uavis moors
will be somewhat lessened the coming
yea;.
