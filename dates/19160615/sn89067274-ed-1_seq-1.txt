THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE
I ON Saturday afternoon lie Re
publican convention in Chicago on the
hjrd ballot nominated Chief Justice
Jlughci for President, by a vote 949
kith a few scattering. The same con
tention nominated C. W. Fairbanks,
M Indiana for vice-president. A few
Jminute later the Progressive eon.
iention in Chicago nominated Theo
dore Roosevelt for President, and
(apt J. M. Parker of Louisiana for
vice-president. Theodore Roosevelt
declined to accept the nomination for
President at the hands' of the Pro
gressives and it is expected that 'ha
will support Hughes with more or less
,-ordiality. '
The contest for President of tho
United States on next November
will be between President Woodrow
Wilson and Ex-Chief Justice Hughes,
and we believe that President Wilson
will be re-elected by an overwhelm
ing majority. A large number of
Progressives in this country, we feel
confident, will prefer Wilson to
Hughes; and we see no reason, espec
ially in v'ew ' our international con
troversies, why there should be any
change in the presidency of the United
Stales. . President Wilson has kept
us out of war with honor, and there
never was auch prosperity in this
country as there is today.
HARMONIOUS DEMOCRATIC
CONVENTION
THE writer was in St. Louis a lit
tle while Tuesday night and was im
pressed with the enthusiasm and har
mony among the Democrats assemb
led from every state in the Union,
While there are no contests for the
presidential nomination, the members
of the party are wido awake and en
thusiastic, and the platform promises
to be the strongest and most satisfac-
tory the party has ever adopted. Wc
confidently believe that the major
ity of the Progressives will lino up
with the Democratic Party, and that
President Wilson will bo re-elected
bj in overwhelming majority. Those
iko are fighting him the strongest
ud abusing him the loudest, cannot
jni s single valid reason why he
od l' defeated. When they criti
I tiiiuj one of his policies, they can't
j numrthow to improve on them. It

JIE.YICO'S FOURTH OK
JULY CELEBRATION
- IT is hoped that all of the merch
ant will see their way clear to close
their stores at 11:00 a. m. on tho 4th
of July so their employes can all par
take in the 4th of July celebration. It
has been suggested that those who did
not desire to stay closed all day could
close at 11:00 a. m. and open, say at
4:00 p. m.
We are to have a most enjoyable
celebration, and in order to make nn
entertainment of this kind a success
our business men generally must co
operate and participate. The enter
tainmnt during the daytime will be
in charge of the Catholic Church, and
at night will be looked after by the
Elks, but everybody is cordially in
vited. It is everybody's celebration.
IT is now Justice Brandies. Every
Democratic and several western Re
publican Senators voted for confirma
tion of the appointment of the "peo
ple's lawyer," after the standpatters
and their cowardly helpers had de
layed the matter for five months. Tho
appointment of Brandeis and the in
sistence upon confirmation by Presi
dent Wilson shows that the President
i in close sympathy with tho masses
instead of the classes. Another rca
son why he'll win in November.
EVERYBODY should make
their arangements to come ti
Mexico to help celebrate the 4th
of July. The Catholic Church
will look after the entertain
ment during the daytime and
the Elks at night. This is every
body's fourth of July and every
body should participate and help
celebrate. . -
THERE is a Btriko on in tho Brown
Shoe Factory at Moborly, Mo., and
there is some talk of the factory be
ing closed down and abandoned. We
are to be congratulated in Mexico
that the attempt to start a strike in
our facory some time ago met with
no approval, either in or out of the
factory.
SCHILLER knew what he was
talking about when he said: "My son
nothing in this world is without sig
nificance, but the first and most es
sential matter in every earthly thins
is the place where and the hour when,
SEVEN negroes, most of them
women, have been arrested for boot-
,pf?ging. If some of the bootlegger'
were turned over to the United States
Government, it might teach them
lesson they would not forget.
WE are of the opinion that thou3-
nnds and thousands of Progressiva
throughout the entire country wi
vto for Wilson in preference
Hughes at the November election.
THE farmers all say wo aro goinu
to have a record breaking corn crop
this year if wo have plenty of rain
in July and August.
THE sum of $3030 has been np
Portioned to Audrain County from tho
various good roads funds by Auditor
Gordon.

COMPLAINT HAS BEEN FILED
Formal Complaint Mont Now Be En
tered According to Secretary
Bradbury of Service Commissin
While Hon. Howard D. Shaw, a
member of the state public service
commission at Jefferson City, was in
Mexico last week, Judge Alex Carter
of the county court took him out and
showed him the dangr to traffic
through the sub-way under the Chi
cago A Alton Just east of Mexico.
The editor of the Ledger had some
correspondence with Hon. John M.
Atkinson regarding the matter be
fore he had resigned from the board,
and a complaint had been filed. As
the matter now stands, it seems in
order to get results formal complaint
must now be made if further action
is to be taken, and we trust that this
matter will be looked after promptly
either by the eight mile road district
councilmen or county court, the auto
mobile club or the commercial club.
The following letter received to
day from Secretary Bradbury of the
public service commission explains
itself: ,
' June 16, 1916
Hon. R. M. White, et al.,
Mexico, Mo.
Dear Col. White:
Replying to your letter of the 9th
instant, Commissioner Shaw, relative
to C. & A. subway:
On account of Commissioner's limit
ed appropriation tnd to the consequent
reduction in the engineering force,
there has been unusual delay in con
cluding this matter. But it having
now developed that an adjustment
cannot be made in an informal pro
cedure it becomes necessary to resort
to formal action, and the informal
correspondence has been closed and
formal complaint must now be made
if further action is to be taken. To
that end, therefore am sending you
under other over, copy of the P. S. C.
law referring you to Section 50 j also
copy of the Rules of Practice and Pro
cedure, referring you to Rules 6 and
Form 2, page 24 of the latter pam
phlet. Taken together these will give
you all the information necessary to
make formal application for the ac
tion dsired. You will notice that five
copies of the application must be filed
but only the original need be acknowl
edged before a notary, though the
blanks in the certificates on the copies
should be filled in, to make them com
plete. Certified copy of the action
of the County Court providing for
widening the sub-way, or change in
crossing, as may be deemed best,
should accompany the papers. As soon
as proper filing is made the Commis
sion will act promptly.
For the Commission,
T. M. BRADBURY, Sec'y.

morning, June 11, at the home of the
bride's mother, Mrs. Fred W. Brand.
The wedding was a very quiet home
affair with only immediate friends of

MASONIC HOME, ST. LOUIS
G.
N. Burth Formerly of Laddonia
and Dr. McFarland of Mexico
Live There
G. N. Burch who formerly lived at
Laddonia and is now living at the
Masonic Home in St. Louis, made the
Ledger a pleasant call this week, and
says that Dr. McFarland of Mexico
who is in the Home now aged eighty
two years is enjoying good health.
Mr. Burch says the Masonic Home is
one of the best institutions in its kind
in the whole country. The inhabitants
of the home at this time are: 86 men
77 women, 46 boys, 53 girls. This is

Has Lived in Mexico Since 1835
Rufus Pearson, Who Celebrated His Sixty-Eighth Wedding
Anniversary Wednesday, is Mexico's Oldest Resident.
Wednesday is the sixty-eighth an
niversary of the marriage of Rufus
Pearson to Miss Lucy Ann Ward. The
wedding took place at the home of
the bride's father which stood where
Phillip's store now stands. Mr. and
Mrs. Pearson are living in Mexico
at 814 E. Jackson street at the pres
ent time, having lived here longer
than any other person in the city.
Mr. Pearson, though now more
than ninety years of age is not an old
man for his heart is Btill young. Ho
talks with interest of times far be
yond the recollection of any one now
living here.
Rufus Pearson was born in Burke
County, North Carolina in 1826. In
1834 he came with his father to Mis
souri, living for one year in Callaway
county and the next year, 1835, mov
ing to what is now Mexico.
"When I moved here with my fath
er in 1835," said Mr. Pearson, "Au
drain county had not been organized
and the city of Mexico was not loated.
All the land around here was govern
ment tend, which we cleared for farm
ing."
From 1851 to 1860, the outbreak of
the war, Mr. Pearson conducted a
dry goods and grocery store in Mex
ico. In 1871, after the war he re
turned to Mexico, having served in
the war and been over a great part of
the United States, and again enter
ed the grocery and dry goods busi
ness. Ite, with his two partners J.
D. Morris and B. R. Cauthorn, con
ducted a general store on the south
side of the square, where Dr. Reed's

The sit and fashion of them show the designers had
skill and taste their careful workmanship speak of
the expertness of nimble fingers that make "FITRITE"
True, there are plenty of summery models in rich,
flaring-flounce taffetas and close-weave poplins, (all
you need to know what service anyone of them will
give is to feel them,) but our display of WHITE TUB
SILK PETTICOATS will well deserve the compliments
it will receive. Brides especially will each want one or
two for their trousseaux. They're made with double
panel front and back which removes possibility of that
discomfiting X-ray feeling. See these new "Fitrites"
tomorrow.

Doubtless Mr. Pearson can tell
from memory more of the early his
tory of Audrain county and of the
city of Mexico than any other living
persons. Mr. Pearson is well preserv
ed and vigorous, despite his many
years. His simple whole hearted hos
pitality and courtesy takes one back
to the pioneer times of Missouri
which it has been denied the young
er generation to enjoy and of which
we can know nothing, first hand, save
when we are fortunate enough to have '
the privelege of a few hours conver
sation with one like Rufus Pearson.
Mr. . Pearson says he expects to
live to be one hundred. "It is a sur
prise to me that I am here at all,
when I think of the chances I have
had to die," smilingly remarked Mr.
Pearson. "I could talk for hours
about times that are past, but I
sometimes feel that people are bored
by such things." If one has ever
been fortunate to talk with Mr. Pear
son and hear the interesting things
he can tell of the early history of Mex
ico, he will feel inclined to argue with
him on that score, for Mr. Pearson can
hold ones interest for hours at a
time narrating the events of long
ago in Mexico.
Mr. Pearson is the father of eight
children, four of whom, George Pear
son, Wallace Pearson, Miss Nina
Pearson and Mrs. J. F. McWilliams,
live in Mexico. M. W. Pearson is a
dentist in St Louis, C. A. Pearson,
lives in Sedalia, Mo.,; Stanley Pear
son lives in Colorado, and Mrs. W. T.
Lemon lives in Fulton.
The Rev. J. D. Greer went to Se
dalia Monday to attend the State
Convention of the Christian Church.
He will go to Kansas City later to
hear Billy Sunday.
Horace Paul is here from Oak
land, Calif., shaking hands with
friends, and is much pleased with the
improvements taken place in Mex
ico. Horace says he likes California,
but is very fond of his old home town.
