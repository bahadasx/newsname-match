The Next President a Splendid Man
The Citizen's candidate, Mr. Justice Hughes, has
been nominated by the Republican party.
Our present chief magistrate will be nominated for
re-election by the Democrats.
The country will thus be sure of having a splendid
man in the chief executive office for the next four years.
Both of these men are able, patriotic, and unselfish, and
the nation is fortunate in that the choice lies not between
bad men, but between good men.
The campaign, looking towards the choice between
thesw men, ought to be clean and calm, and one conduct
ed along elevating lines, and free from all misrepresenta
tions, recrimination and abuse. There are legitimate ar
guments for and against each of these candidates con
nected with the platform, on which they stand, and the
statesmen by whom they are surrounded. But there is no
reason nor excuse for disparagement of the high charac
ter and extraordinary ability of these two champion
Americans.
Berea's Commencement
Commencement day at Berea was threatened by
rain, and the crowd seemed less than usual, but the
occasion was of unsurpassed interest.
The greatness of the day was somewhat concealed
by the great number of interests. There was a meeting
of the Trustees, bringing men from far off cities to coun
sel for the welfare of Berea. There was a reunion of the
fraduates, bringning former students from a dozen States,
her were exhibits of industries and school work worth
whole days of study. There were student exercises which
showed what is the present thought and future promise of
the oncoming generation. And above all there was a
superb series of addresses by great men, each one of
which was memorable.
The Fall Term opens September the 13th.

simply by virtue of his connection
with Berea he is able to illuminate
from an unusual angle one possible
function of the next assembly. If
thereby any shall visit Charlottes
ville with a clearer understanding of
a unique people from an obscure sec
tion the effort will not have been
in vain.
The term "Appalachia" has been
most aptly used in speaking of that
rough virgin portion of our country
lying in the mountain counties of
the states of Virginia, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Caro
lina, South Carolina, Georgia and
Alabama. Here is an area equal to
New England and New York whose
rugged character may be Judged by
noting that although the Atlantic
States north of the Potomac can
boast of but twelve mountain peaks
over five thousand feet high and but
one. Ml. Washington, over six thous
and, this section claims forty-one
over six thousand feet and two hun
dred and eighty-eight over five
thousand, to say nothing of hun
dreds of miles of ridges'higher than
Monadnock.
Hemmed in by such natural bar
riers is a people whose everyday life
and social condition are silent but
all-powerful invitations to every
kind of education "to come over into
Macedonia." A study of the thirty
five mountain counties of eastern
Kentucky, which are typical of the
whole region, will prove a revelation
to those ignorant of the situation.
Here, in a territory twice as large
as Massachusetts, are Ave hundred
and sixty-one thousand eight bun

raid took place at T. A. Coleman's

county, 30 miles east of Laredo. There
were no casuallties on either side.
Bandit troopers, under the leader
ship of Luis de la Rosa, crossed the
Rio Grhnde not tar from Nueva La

made away with some 80 odd head of
horses. The raid came unexpectedly.
When Luis de la Rosa advertised ex

Funaton that It waa a feint to "draw

Rapid Spread of Anti-American Senti

General Pershing's Column.
Washington, June 13. With 1,500
additional regular troops ordered to
the Mexican border and reports of the
rapid spread of anti-American feeling
continuing to come In from consuls
all over northern Mexico, administra
tion officials made no attempt to dis
guise their uneasiness. It was offi
cially admitted that there la growing
alarm over what the agitation may
produce and the possibility of an at
tack on General Pershing's expedition.
No case of attack on the persona of
American residents in Mexico has
been reported, although there have
been one or two attacks on vacant
consulates and other American prop
erty. Part of the increasing apprehension
hero is due to the renewed raids In
the Laredo region. Several reports
dealing with the situation there have
been received. Officials declined to
reveal details, but they gave the Im
presslon of baring reason to believe
a serious purpose was behind the ban
dit raid on the Coleman ranch.
Three raiders were killed and three
captured, one report said. They tried
to burn a railroad bridge near Lare

The secretary said there was no pres

duty.

The rapture of more than 65,000
prisoners is reported by Petrograd
since the recent offensive began, and
further gains made against the
AiiHtro-Hungarian forces were
chronicled in Friday's dispatches.
Twelve members of the crew of

announcement by the English Ad

Heavy fighting has been in pro
gress for 600 or 700 miles from the
Gulf of Riga to Bukowina. Russians
made fresh gains despite a German
offensive intended to divert the drive
against the Austro-Hungarians and
Germans.
South and southwest of Trent the

Greatest Battla of War Rn:i

CHECK RUSS AT TWO POINTS
Csar'a Fercee Capture 131,000 Aus
trians In Big Drive CzemowHtz Is
Being Evacuated Affhr Being Bat
tered by the Russian's Heavy Guns.
London, June 13. From the region
around the big Russian Baltic seaport,
down to the suburbs of Csernowlts,
capital of the Bukowina provuoa, a
front of eight hundred miles, the
greatest battle of the war haa been
raging for the last twelve hours and
la gaining hourly in fury. In point of
numbers, length of the battle line, and
strategical importance, Verdun Is
eclipsed, and the Austrian offensive
on the Trentino appears like a skirm
ish alongside of the gigantic struggle
In the oast, thus far only in its pri
mary stages.
The Germans have come to the aid
of their hard-pressed ally in the south
and the Russian offensive in Volhynla,
Galicia and the Bukowina, now ten
days old, haa changed over night Into
a death grapple between Teutons and
Russians, that promises definitely to
decide matters in the east
At the most essential point of the
southern battle line In southern Buko
wina, the German aid has thus far
failed to stem the Russian tide. The
csar'a forces are continuing in their
dash to the capital, Csernowlts, whose
fortified suburbs are now being bat
tered by their heavy guns. Unofficial
reports announce the evacuation of
the town.
Farther north, however, around the
town of Bobullntse on the Strypa,
fifteen miles north of Bucsacs, tho
Austrian-Hungarians, strongly rein
forced by Germans, have scored til el r
first substantial success sine the
czar's onslaughts began. They
launched a furious counter attack,
bringing the Russian assaults to a
standstill and even forcing the Musco
vite troops to take backthelr lines.
According to the German war office
mora than 1,300 Russian prisoners
were taken. Petrograd officially ad
mits that the Russians withdrew their
lines "a little."
This success, which postpones for
the moment a massed Invaalon of the
Nukowlna, was made possible by the
fact that Count von Botbmer, com
mander of the German army, hitherto
stationed north of the Prlpet, hurried
with part of his forces south, extend
ing bis lines not less than 183 miles,
and taking a hand in the battle norh
of Rucxacs, evidently In the psycho
logical moment, saved the day for thJ
Austro-Hungarians.
Simultaneously with this partial re
lief In the south, Field Marshal vo.i
Hlndenburg began a general offenslvo
against the Russian right wing and
part of the center, launching concen
trated attacks at five different points.
He penetrated the caar's lines at two
points near Jacobatadt. half way be
tween Rlaa and Dwlnak, and at Koch
any between Lake Narotch and
Dwlnak. At the three other points
In the Riga sone, south of Lake Drys-
vlaty, and on the Jaaaelda his attacks
broke down under the Russian fire.
The Austro-Hungartaa troops, in ad
dition to their attacks north of Bucs
acs, launched a similar counter of
fensive north of Tarnopol, rushing
forward six successive times. They
failed each time.
