Holbrook Wins from St. Johns
Last Sunday afternoon in St.
Johns the Holbroqk base ball chb
crossed bats with' the St. Johns
club, winning the game by a score
24 to 17. Notwithstanding the
fact that the Holbrook boy- are
accustomed to playing on a re
gular diamond, and not in a stub
blefield thickly populated with
prairie dogs, the victory was easy.
Since its reorganization the local
club has been practicing the game
and it is now in better shape than
ever before. Holbrook News.
Cannot Change Registration
According to an opinion handr
ed down by Wiley E. Jones, at
torney general, those who have
registered for the fall primaries
'no party" must let that classifi
cation stand. Since the registra
tion opened there has been con
siderable question as to the right
of a prospective voter to declare
his politics one way then to
change that declaration.
When a Lad Meets a Maid.
Old heads who forget that they
were once young find much amuse
ment in watching a young lad
when he meets a maid -on the
street. We stood on a street cor
ner the other day and watched an
eminent citizen of mature years
as he in turn gazed upon bashful
and blushing youth. No, we
won't tell you. of the amusing dig
nity and decorum of the lad and
the maid for we have been guilty
of the same antics away back in
days that will never come again.
But it was amusing tp our emin
ent citizen and we think he was
quite as amusing to us. In fact, we
are not through smiling yet at
the eminent one. But the next
time you are on the street and a
lad and a maid met face to face,
and you suspect that there is a
tender feeling between them jest
remember the golden days of
your own youth, and see not
things that you are not supposed
to see.
Of ttimes an innocent smile is a
shaft that cuts deep.
Stomach Trouble and Constipation.
"I will cheerfully say that
Chamberlain's Tablets are the
most satisfactory remedy for
stomach troubles and constipation
that I have sold in thirty-four
years' drugstore service," writes
S. H. Murphy, druggist, Wells-;

Your Daughter's Confidence
The best way to shut a girl's
mouth, when she comes with con
fidences about -her lover, is to
show that you are disturbed or
offended by what she tells, says a
writer in Farm and Home.
The very fact that she has told
you is a thing to give thanks to
God for, for it gives you a notion
of what you must prepare to
combat. If you object to what
she has told you, convey your
objections indirectly, make her
condemn herself or him from her
own mouth, call her own common
sense into play, teach her to think
for herself in this, as in other
matters.
A hasty outbreak may cost you
her confidence forever and a day.
Patience and tact, and tender,
everlasting love will do for you
and her what no amount of
storming and force could do.
Horse Sense for Horsemen.
Don't overload your horses.
Don't feed too much corn in hot
weather.
Don't make sudden changes in
the. feed.
Don't keep your horses in poor
ly ventilated, stables.
Don't feed grain to
TO-,
"drill,
horses. Give them hay first.
Don't allow the harness, es -
pecially the collar, to chafe nor
neglect to clean the harness once
in a while, -
Don't expect your horses to re -
lish their feed unless the man-
gers are clean.
Don't let your horses drink a
large amount of water on coming
into the stable very warm. Al-
low them to cool off a bit first,
Don't allow young horses to
wear a set of shoes more than a
month. Have themremoved, the.
hoofs leveled, and the shoes re
set if they are worth it.
