ST. R. KNOWS
t BIBLE, BUT--
ISAYS HUGHES
iBY EDGAR C. WHEELER
Hugh's spoke his mind about Roosevelt for the first
time today.
What's more, he tool: a back ship at the colonel just
when lhe colonel was hcrving x-ray trouble with his- crack-
Hughe/ statement came as a distinct surprise, especial
ly since tlie controversy -.fas about nothing less than the Bible.
mttghes is being accused by some of hilling b<'lo:c the ribs.
It all came as the direct result of the colonel's josh about
w^'"S A gag yesterday, when he told puzzled newspaper men
Vie, believed that he, Roosevelt, hail promoted biblical reading
mto a greater extent than any other man in lhe country.
"I suppose lie's thinking about that Armageddon stuff,"
micas Hughes' retort courteous, when interviewed by a Times
A man today.
' He may be correct about promoting biblical reading, in lel
■ t<r at least, liul at the rate he's going HOW, there is sinne doubt
a whether he's promoting it iv spirit."
Just OS T. R. chuckled yesterday when he sprung King Agog
I and had the fun of telling the-despairing newspapermen thai
I his majesty teas to be found in Ihe first chapter of Samuel,
\ just so did Hughes chuckle today, so pleased was he with his
I come back.
A Different Mr. Hughes
Pardon us. Mr. and Mrs. Reader, lint we forgot to say al
the beginning that (lie Mr. Hughei who tame back at T. R,
was nut the ti. (). P. Mr. Hughes who is running fur pre.-i
--dent, bul a profound reader of tlie liible—Bishop Mathew S.
Hughes, newly appointed bishop of tlie Methodist churches of
tlie northwest.
Mat is in Tacoma today. Charlie isn't,
Bishop Hughes is a real human sort of a fellow along with
liis bishopry. Of course he would have to be. since he was once
a newspaper man himself, a city editor on a daily.
When be chuckled, be chuckled in a whole-hearted wav that
meant that Col. Roosevelt and his King Agag tickled him.
One of the strongest lieliefs of tbe bisbop is bis belief in tbe
American home, lie says an apartment is no place for chil
dren or grownups, either.
And because he believes so much in thi'American houie, he
believes in preparedness — preparedness for protection and dc
■ fciisc of these home.
"Any other kind of defense is d''vilish."
That's what he said today.
With T. R. on Preparedness
But returning to Roosevelt antl his claim of promoting bib
lical rending:
"Roosevelt undoubtedly is a great literary man. as well as
a great public man and every other kind ot a man," said
Hughes.
"And because lie is a literary man lie would He fond of
reading tlie Bible and would know it. In fact be could not be a
great literary man unless be did.
"Also be is tbe type of man who would pick as bis favorites
tbe parts of tbe Bible where tbere is fighting to be done. Tie
knows tbe old testament. It's bis strong pofat You can't
fool him on it."
But even though be doubts if T. R. is promoting tbe spirit
of tbe Bible. Bisbop Hughes is right with him on the prepar
edness proposition.
"As long as a nation is compelled to receive and send notes,
it needs to watch out for and protect its homes and firesides,
•• to safeguard the peace and liberties of its people," he said. j
Tht bishop thought it wouldn't do for him to get mixed up
in any local controversy, such as is going on in the Tacoma
Ministerial Alliance over Tacoma's big preparedness parade
aud compulsory military drill in the high schools.
■ Replies to Rev. Dyer
Bul he did answer one of the statements made by Dr. Frank
Dyer in the argument with Dr. Robert H. Milligan at the Com
mercial club member's council meeting yesterday.
Dyer's statement was that 'after all. the extreme effort that
is being put forth to compel other people's sons to train to fight
and for big parades, is one of the most encouraging signs of
the times. Never before in the history of mankind did any
body find it necessary to get up a parade to prove that a coun
try would fight if it had to."
"Yes," «'fl.r the bishop's reply. "Rut akvays before when a
crisis has fae'd us we have been so unprepared that ~wc have
had to be spontaneously enthusiastic about preparing. There
has been no time for anything else but to be enthusiastic."
T. R.s Injury An Old One
NEW YORK, June IB. —An X
ray examination of Roosevelt dis
closed the injury to be on the
same torn ligament sustained a
year ago. The oalonel said he
was feeling fine.
The doctors asked blm not to
exercise too vigorously until the
tear had healed.

ENDORSE
MEXICAN
POLICIES
ST. LOUIS, June ll.—"Hy
phenates" will he denounced m
the democratic platform.
President Wilson's views on In
ternational relations, Mexico, suf
frage and other Issues wll dom
inate the platform.
The tentative draft which Sec
retary of War Haker brought here
touches only the high spots.
Besides an Americanism plank,
it was learned today, the presi
dent's suggestions were for a
navy sufficient to protect Ameri
can interests, an army sufficient
to protect the borders and form
a nucleus for an efficient fight
ing force.
For Suffrage, Too.
Voluntary military training la
urged.
Mexico is not mentioned by
name, but the policy of the ad
ministration toward weaker na
tions ts upheld with the declara
tion that the U. S. should not in
terfere in their internal affairs
except in extreme cases.
It declares for woman's suf
frage more frankly than does the
republican platform, but leaves
the whole matter for (he states
to decide.
I pin. Ids Tariff Law.
The Underwood tariff law Is
upheld.
The eight hour day on public
work, closer co-operation between
the government and industries
and labor laws that have been
passed are mentioned.
The platform points to the fed
eral reserve act as one of the ad
ministration's greatest achieve
ments.
TWO SAY THEY'LL
SUPPORT HUGHES
Stanton Warburton and W. W.
Seymour have Just returned from
Chicago with avowed purposes of
supporting Hughes. Warburton
was n delegate to tbe progressive
convention.
Talk Recall
Instead of
Impeachment
The impeachment proceedings
against Commissioner .lames C.
Drake may he dropped, and a re
call launched against him, accord
ing to hints dropped at the city
hall today.
Inability to impeach the com
missioner, because Commissioner
Atkins will refuse to vote to oust
him, and four votes are necessary
for an impeachment, is given as
the cause.
Atkins Is reported to have told
friends that lie would not vote to
impeach Drake. During tlie past
two years he and Drake have vot
ed together on practically every
question that has come before
the council, and have been good
friends.
Rather than allow the impeach
ment to become a farce, the oth
er commissioners are reported to
te ready to drop the proceedings
and to favor the circulation of re
call petitions.
None of the city hall officials
wis willing to discuss tlie rumors
today.
Many of the rich men
of today laid the foun
dation of wealth by
depositing their sur
plus earnings in a
savings bank. Cannot
you do likewise?
Wealthy folks are
usually made so thru
habits of saving. And
we are here to help
them along.

BRYAN TO
MAKE AN
ADDRESS
ST. I.Oins, .lime !».— Judge
Westcott of New Jersey will nomi
nate Wilson at the democratic
convention tonight at 8 o'clock, it
was announced today.
The credentials committee re
ported that everything was adopt
ed without a ilcliate. The com
mittee on permanent organisation]
reported that Ollie .lames had
been ChO— as iicrnianent chair-i
man.
(ilynn Introduced him and liei
delivered his speech, which was
repeatedly interrupted by cheers
and demonstrations. Meanwhile
the platform committee contin
ued working.
The Wilson demonstration last
ed I ."i iiiinuies. When James
concluded, I Bryan demons!ra
tion was started. James an
noniueii Bryan would speak later.
Postmaster William Kasting
of Buffalo, I delegate, died sud
denly today. Alter the an
nouncement that Wilson ".mild be
nominated tonight, the meeting
adjourned. It may be that the
nomination will lie made before
a platform Is adopted.
Texas started a parade after
the committeemen on the plat
form completed a war dance. The
noise rontiiHii'd for I I minutes,
James pounding vigorously for
order.
Nomination speeches will begin
at 8 o'clock tonight with West
cott's nomination of Wilson. Sec
onding speeches are limited to five
minutes.
Following Wilson's nomination,
which will probably lie by accla
mation, John Kern will present
the name of Marshall for vice
president.
Today's session was pictur
esque. James' speerh waa one
of defiance. He boasted of Wil
son's successful maintenance of
peace and professed optimism
that tlie people will perpetuate
Wllsonian politics.
Precedent may be smashed to
night by nominating before adopt
ing a platform. The committee
had not finished tlie platform lo
iday when the convention ad
journed.
Hughes Placid
NSW YORK, June I :•—Wil
son's anti-hyphenate speech yes
terday in Washington failed to
disturb Hughes' placidity. He
isn't talkiiiK politics for publica

He indicated, however, he will

will leave New York tomorrow
and return Monday, when he will

prevails he wijl make a nation

and sundry bottles, lias gotten r\-
Congreastnan Stanton WarbUrton
into a mess of irouble.
Warburton was arrested at the

detectives who had been watch
ing the trunk ever sinre ii ar

He was taken into custody on a
"Joe Doe" warrant charging ille
gal transportation of liquor.
He was taken to police head
quarters, where he deposited |StO

The trouble was that one of the
bottles in the "boose trunk"
broke in transit. When baggage
men at the Tacoma station re
ceived the trunk, tiny delected a
peculiar odor.
Warburton came finally with a
baggage check, and claimed the
trunk. He gave tlie name of
"James S. Wadsworth."
The steamer trunk weighed
270 pounds — loaded- and con
