puring his speech Glynn was constantly interrupted by cheerjftg
? and appl?use, especially during his recital bf Wjson's effort to keep"
peace. When he gave the list of Presidents whd had adjusted
threatening foreign situations without a resort to arms, the delegates
caught the spirit of argument As he referred to each particular
j President some delegate would call ''what did he do." Glynn would
invariably, reply: "he settled trouble by negotiation.
Bryan was presentas ? newspaper correspondent and wept as thc
; speaker pictured victories of peace, j Glynn declared Wilson had
