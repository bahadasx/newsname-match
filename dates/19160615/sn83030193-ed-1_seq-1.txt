The bandits llrst attacked Troop M.
Troop I, a short distance- up Iho river,
heard tho shooting ami hurtled to the
rerciie. The attackers soon lost
heart and retreated southward alone
tho rler, keeping on the American
elde for some distance befote ciosslng
to Mexican soil.
The attack began at : A M. and the
fighting lasted about thirty minutes.
A bright moon lighted the scene. The
Americans wero only partly sur
prised. The Mcxuans succeeded In
making their way around to the rear
of tho patrol's ramp. Tho llrst shot
was fired at a sentry.
The names of the other two dend
nolillers wcr not reported to mili
tary headquarters at l'ort Mcin
tosh for tho reason that Immedi
ately after the attack the two troops
of ravHlry started In pursuit of the
Mexicans. It was taken for grant
ed here that Major Oray would pursue
the bandits until they crossed Into
Mexico and that It would not be sur
prising If the Americans should follow
tho "hot trail" across the river.
In the clothing of one of the bandits
killed were found papers indicating,
that he was an officer in the Carranza
Army, aceordino to a late report from
Gen. Mann.
Major Oray later stated that he had
communicated wnh Cnrrunzii troops
on thn Mexican sldo of I lie III"

Big Strike Now Looms Up as

The Joint conference between the
rallrnail managers of the t'nlted
States and representatives of the four
big brotherhoods of railway employees
came to a sudden termination tills
afternoon with a complcto rejection
of tho union demands. The managers
and brotherhood delegates have been
In fusion since June 1, and the union
mu have adhered strictly to their
originnl demands for an eight-hour
day anil time and a half pay for oxer
time. Kli-Min l.ee, i haiciiau for th mil-,
wnv managers, deiered thn dictum
to the delegates n the form of a state
ment to A. II. (Jarretlson, spokesman
for the four brotherhoods. In his
statement Mr. I, en in part declares.
"Tln national conference commute.

The statement then goes on to point
out that tho proposals of the four
brotherhoods would Inereuso tho cost
of oporatlon to the railroads by $ 1 00, -OoiV'Oo
a year. "All of which," sas
tho statement," must bn borne by the
public."
A. 11. Uarrettson would not state
what tho employoes -would do. He
said the delegates to tho conference
would return home and report the
oulcomo to their various L'nlons and
that the Brotherhoods would then
vote as lo tho future. 11 Is gener

result.
