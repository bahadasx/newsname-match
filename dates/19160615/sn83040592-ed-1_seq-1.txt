Killing in Baxter
Two Negroee Quarrel Over Pork
Chops One Stabs the Other
to Death.
Last Friday evening two ne
groes connected with a minstrel
show which was showing
here with the Carnival Com
pany, got into an altercation at
the mess table of their show tent,
and as a result one of the neg
roes, called "Big Boy," is dead,
being killed almost instantly by
a knife in the hands of Jolly Jack
Johnson.
It seems that four negroes sat
down to their evening meal, and
that there were only three pork
chops. "Big Boy" and Johnson
got into an altercation over who
would have to go without, and
"Big Boy," it is alleged by those
who saw the trouble, reached for
a hatchet, and struck at Johnson.
Johnson grabbed a big butcher
knife and prepared to defend him
self, which he did very ably, as
he stuck the knife directly into
the other fellows heart
The knife was taken away
from Johnson, and he ran, mak
ing his getaway for the time be
ing, as it was about six o'clock
when the trouble occurred. He
was captured next day, however,
by Marshal Horton, who found
him hiding in a box car on the
M. 0. & G.
The coroner was notified and
came down Friday night and held
an inquest.
The coroner's jury which was
sworn in the night of the killing
viewed the body, and adjourned
until Monday afternoon. After
hearing the testimony of the wit
nesses the jury decided the killing
was in self defense, and the coun
ty attorney dismissed the case. "
Don't Wait on City.
Some time ago the city or
dered a lot of sidewalk in the
west and northwest part of town.
The time limit has not yet ex
pired, when property owners may
build their own walks, but Joe
Shearer, Harry Stein, E. A.
Haines, Leu" Newman, George
Van Dusen and 0. N. Baldwin
have commenced work on their
walks. The walk from the west
gravel road to the Spring blanch
on Council street is about finished,
as is also the walk from Martin
Shanks' corner north three blocks
to Kelsey's. A walk is to be built
from the Kelsey corner west to
the Frisco right of way, and from
the latter point the Frisco will
build a walk to the Frisco station.
Other walks will also be built
in the west part of town.
Another big strike out on the
Hocker land is making things
look up out in that part of the
country.
Jim Barnes tells us -that he

That electrical storm last Sun
day morning was a dinger. The
lightning was about the keenest
ever seen in this part of the coun
try. And the rain which fol
lowed the electrical storm was
heavy. At several places north
on the Frisco there were bad
washouts. Spring river got up
