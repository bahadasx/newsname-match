Petition for; Confirmation' of
1 His Appointment Taken in :
Advisement By Ashford
:If it be. k' tact that no member of
the alumni of the Kamehameha schools
is fitted to be appointed to the board
of trustees of the Bishop Estate, then
somebody ought to answer the ques
tion: What is the matter with the
school or the board which controls the
school?" i .. : ; .Y ,. i
Thus declared Circuit Judge Ash
ford today in taking under advisement
a, petition for the confirmation of the
nomination by the supreme court of
William Williamson as a trustee of
the Bishop-Estate, to succeed Samuel
M. Damon t resigned, .-j . ';v
. Taking part in the argument of the
petition as "friends of the court," At
torney D. I W'lthlngton, Antonio Per
ry and A. S. Humphreys stated- they
were of the opinion that the justices
cf the supreme court, acting under
the provisions of the will of the late
Mrs. Bishop, have made the appoint
ment of Williamson and that no con
firmation of the nomination by the
lower court is necessary; also, : that
the petition for confirmation bo dis
pensed with. .;'-
Judge Perry, who spoke first for the
"friends of the court." stated that any
attempt to vest In the supreme court
any power . of appointing trustees
might be invalid, but that it evidently
was the idea of Mrs. Bishop to place
such appointments in the hands of per
sons who, when the time came, would
be the justices of the supreme court.
He pointed out that. In his opinion,
the justices were simply called upon
to choose a person to fill a vacancy
In the board. ' . . i
The lowfcr court might interfere, he
added, if the justices appointed a per;
son deemed ineligible to fill the posi
tion. For instance if the justices ap
pointed a Catholic, they would go be
yond the limits of their powers, as
the will provides that trustees shall
be persons of Protestant faith, he ex
plained. :,
"it is just a question of whethei
the appointee is eligible," Judge Perrj
said. "If under the will he is quali
fied, then the appointment must be left
where It stands."
Similtar opinions were expressed by
Attorney Withington who stated thai
he believed the petition should be dis
missed for want of jurisdiction by the
lower court He added that he could
find nothing giving the lower court the
right to act on Williamson's nomina
tion." - ' ; :: :,
Speaking for the alumni association
of the Kamehameha schools. Attorney
E. C. Peters stated that he believed
that the power of the supreme court
to appoint trustees and fill vacanciet
had been transferred to the courts ol
equity; "By the terms of the will, as
I understand them, the justices, may
only choose a successor," he added.
"Then there is the question as to
whether the appointment ; must come
before the circuit court for confirma
tion. But there has been no choice
here. Williamson was chosen by the
trustees of the estate, as shown by
their petition."
Stating the reason for the petition
for confirmation. Attorney C H. Olson,
representing the trustees, said that
it was only the following of a past
custom. - ;
At the close of the argument. Judge
Ashford stated that he would hand
