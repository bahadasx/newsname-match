The Chicago conventions are
now among the events of the past
and the results will be passed un
der the judgment of the people,
What the result will be can only
be known after the November
election. The declaration of prin
ciples involved in the platform
seems ample and well amplified
and the nominees of the Repub
lican convention re men who
will command the considerate
judgment of an enlightened and
patriotic people. These men are
better than the platform and are
a platform of themselves,
St. Louis is the center of at
traction this week and what may
result from that deliberation is
already a foregone conclusion so
far as the head of the ticket is
concerned. It ' will be Wilson,
and the only thing in doubt is
who will be his running mate.
There seems to be a fejling a
mong many that Marshal shall be
" kept in place with Wilson pre
sent the same men on the ticket
as were presented four years ago.
With thtse men the slogan of
peace, prosperity and prepared
ness will be heralded. The wise
man has said there is nothing
new under the sun, and this slo
gan is not a new creature. Our
nation has been feastinpron this
aliment for some time, and -the
people have become somewhat
accustomed to diet of the kind as
dished up to appease tne craving
of such a3 are always wanting
something new and untried. It
seems so far as nominees and
platform are concerned that 'the
whole business is fully determ
ined, is cut and dried and leaves
nothing to be done except to
meet and adjourn sine die.
After a week's constant rain
we have had two days without

How Salt Is Obtained.
In speaking of the manner in
which salt is obtained in Ohio,
rof . John A. Bownocker of the
department of geology of the
Ohio State University, said:
''Wells are drHld through one
or more beds of rock-salt and
then water is poured into the
well. After the water is satur
ated or nearly so with salt it is
ifted to the surface and the salt
obtained by evaporation. It is
the strength of brine that gives
this area a great advantage over
he old field at Pomeroy and vi
cinity. The f alt is obtained from
the brine.in two distinct ways:
(1) by grainers, which are long
rectangular troughs in which the
brine is evaporated by steam
heat, and (2) by vacuum pans
which are large egg-shaped steel
vessels into which brine is pour
ed and over which the atmos
pheric pressure is reduced by ma
chinery, and hence the boiling
point of the brine lowered. This
process yields a finer grained salt
than the grainer method and the
cost is less. The salt may be
marketed after drying in the form
that it comes from the vacuum
pans but that for table use is gen
erally screened. Waste material
rom the bcreens is sold for mak
ing ice cream and other purposes
where fineness is not an import
ant factor."

What would be the consequence
to Lake "Erie if its outlet, the Ni
agara river, were closed? "Well,
that very thing happened not
5
long ago, as the "geologist rates
time," said Prof, iohn A. Bow
nocker of the department of ge
ology of the Ohio I State Univer
sity, "for the great glacier which
once covered-the ittva baain of
Lake Erie receded to the north'
east and when its; edge stood a
bout where Buffalo does now, the
ice completely blocked the outlet
of the lake.
f
"Under this condition the wa
ter lefel of the lake rose and cov
ered the adjacent,5 lowland. The
area overfiWed ( was small in
northeastern Ohio, but in the
western part of tlie state the area
was much larger and extended as
far south as Delphos and Van
Wert Finally the water rose so
high that it crossed the divide in
northeastern Indiana and flowed
into the Wabash and finally into
the Gulf of Mexico. How long
the lakw retained this outlet is
not known, but it was sliort, us
ing the geologist's time scale.
However, it was long enough for
the waters to form a ridge or
beach along the shore, and it is
by means of this ridge that the
- - - - - ?'
old border of th !$ke is known.
"Liter the lake' found a lower
outlet across the southern part of
Michigan and the iaters flowed
into Lake Michigan, Since this
outlet "was lower than the old one
near Ft. Wayne, thfe water level
of Lake Erje fell ar d a new ridge
or beach was forme 3. Later the
water of Lake Erie
found a still
ower outlet
across soutnern
Michigan and of coi rse the level
of the lake was dep essed and a
new ridge or beac i was devel
oped.
These three rii(?es can be
easily traced across northern
Ohio, and where they are close
together are commonly known as
the north, middle and south ridg
es. When the pioneers came in
to that part of Ohio they built
houses and villages on these ridg
es because they were better
drained. In places they laid out
roads on them for the same rea
son, and to this day. such roads
are commonly known as ridge
roads. In time the villages be
came towns or cities, and among
the places located on these old
ridges or beaches may be men
tioned Van Wert, Delphos, Find-
1 1 f
lay, Fostoria, Clyde, Bellevue,
Norwalk, Elyria, Cleveland and
Painesville. '
'These ridges, as might be ex
pected, consist largely of sand
and fine gravel, and farmers have
learned that they are well adapt
ed to fruit growing. ' The splen
did cherry orchards near Belle-
yue are located on the highest of
these ridges."

Crop Conditions.
While the wheat is very gen
erally poor and of thin stand,
several counties report marked
improvement during the month,
but with the improvement noted
in some counties, the general
condit'on for the state is only
three points higher than shown
last month. Pre3ent prospects
indicate that the average produc
tion per acre will be about 10.2
bushels. Under normal condi
tions, general state average pro
duction per acre should be 15
bushels. Not only will the pro
duction per acre be low, but the
report shows that 14,877 pcies of
the original area seeded last fall
has been abandoned . This leaves
1,577,352 acres now remaining,
and as many fields are in such
poor condition that they will not
pay for harvesting, the roa will
show a decline from the acreage
above quoted.
Following we quote some of
Ohio's lowest wheat productions
per acre ; 1866, eight and one-half
bushels; 1875, nine bushels; J884,
ten bushels : 1895, twelve bush
els; 1896, eight and one-half bu
shels; 1900, six bushels; 1912, ten
shels.
Oat prospects are reported at
83 per cent, compared with a
normal production per acre 30
bushels per acre being normal,
represented . by 100 pr cent In
this report. The area seeded to
oats for the present harvest is
estimated at 1,820,038 acres.
From the prospect now reported
this should produce approxim
ately 19,668,566 bushels. The
crop is badly infested with weeds.
The last of May found a great
area of com not planted. The
crop is very irregular. Some
ready to be cultivated; some just
making its appearance.
The present prospect of rye is
estimated at 79 per cent, com
pared with a normal yirld.
Winter barley shows a pros
pect of 77 per cent, while the
prospect of spring barley is esti
mated at 86 per cent, compared
with an average.
Clover is estimated at 89 per
cent, compared with a normal
yield. .
Timothy prospect is estimated
at 92 per cent. But small dam
age is reported by grub worm.
The report shows that the num
ber of hogs being fed for sum
mer markets is slightly in excess
of that of last year. The condi
tion of the animals is good.
Fruit prospects are estimated
at 82 per cent, compared with a
normal yield.

Statement
TREMENDOUS SLl'&iP IN BEER
Commissioner Osborne Explains Tl.st
Because of the Added Tax on Fsr
mented Liqucr Revenue Receipts
From Eeer Show an Increase, While
There Is a Big Decrease In Con
sumption of Nearly Two Million
Barrels In Seven Months.
Coiumhr.s, O (Special.) Internal
Revenue Commissioner Osborne In a
statement " to the American Issue
gives figures on the consumption or
beer which disposes of the claims of
certain brewery journals that since
the close of the last flical year, whicli
ended June 20. 1015. t:,e consumptioc,
of beer has increased In the United
States as compared with rhe game
period ot the p;eviou3 ear. This
claim is made because the revenus
receipts from fermented liuuors .show
an incrpf.se.
In his rtalement Commissioner Os
borne points out why this is so. The
receipts from fermented liquors for
'ie seven months ending Jan. 31,
1916, were $31,482,565.82 as against
143,107,485.33 for the seven months
tndin?: Jan. 31, 1S15. This shows an
increase in receipts for the seven
months of this fiscal yeai of $8,375
080.49. However. Commissioner Osbcrne
writes that this comparison fo- the
purpose of showine the consumption
of beer is misleading, as during the
period from July 1 to Oct. 22, 1914,
which is included in the 1915 figures!
the barrel tax on fermented liquors
as $1. Congress increased the tax
to $1.50 per barrel and this increase
went into erect Oct. 22, 1914.
The revenue commissioner shows
that for the seven months ending Jan.
31, 1916, the consumption of beer was
34,302,537 barrels as against 36.209,- !
40S barrels for the corresponding,
months ending Jan. 31, 1915. This
e'.ows a detrcttee in the-seven month -of
1,906,871 barrels.
The figures show that while for the
eeven months ending Jan. 3i, 1 916,
the revenue receipts from beer in
ct eased more than $Sf,000,000 as com
pared with the corresponding months
(la 1915, the consumption for t".ie same
jperiod showed a decrease of 1,906,871
j barrels. The increase in receipts is .
due to the extra 50 cents a barrel tax.
j Tile commissioner makes it clear
that brewery advocates are wrong in
iC'aiming that because internal rev
enue receipts from beer have incieas
i"d in recent months, consumption has
also increased. There is absolutely j
ictning in these figures of Uncle Sam
to bring any joy or hope to the brew-J
ery camp. B
