MAXWELLS IN MEXICO
Automobiles Lead the Way
in Carrying Troops on
- Punitive Expedition
Maxwell motor cars have a
chieved the signal distinction of
attaining the most southerly
point in Mexico of any automo
bile engaged in the punitive ex
pedition in that country. Let
ters from the United States Ar
my officers have been received
by the Buquor Motor Company.
Maxwell distributors in El Paso,
Texas, testifying to the fact that
the sturdy Maxwells have push'
ed farther south over the tortu
ous Mexican trails than any oth
er make of car. These letters
contain words of praise for the
splendid service given by the
Maxwells under oiost discourag
ing conditions.
One of the American officers,
who drove a Maxwell car in the
army s movement to the south,
writes as follows from San An
tonio, Chihuahua: "The car is
standing up well. It has been
given tests to which no other car
with the expedition has been
subjected, We have used the car
on patrol duty and the roads
save the word are unworthy of
the name. Every member of the
staff who has used this car is a
Maxwell booster, for the car has
done everything we have called
for."
In addition to the service per
formed by cars actually, in the
fighting zone, the famous non-
sto" Maxwell, tne car tnat ran
22,000 miles without a single stoplGeneral Baptiat church at Prai.
ot tne motor, nas proven an e
cient auxiliary to Uncle Sam's
fighting force. The car was used
recently by United States offic
ers at Douglas, Arizona, which is
the western center of military
activities along the international
boundary. The efforts of the
non-stop Maxwell have been sup
plemented by a fleet of Maxwells
none of which have seen less
than 10,000 miles ofArizona'siage
service. When a new camp was
established ont of Douglas, the
Maxwells transported the sol
uiero over the rough roads, nine
troops to a car.
These military performances
by Maxwell cars prove what an
effective unit for defense can de
afforded by the motor car facili
ties of the United States. They
prove also the claims in the ser
vice of private owners. The Max
well is an ideal car for service in
Mexico because of its ability to
ride the treacherous mountain
trails and the long stretches of
desert country.

CONFESSES
Feels That His Friends
Should Know All
In a recent letter to the Hays'
Medicine Co., of Paducah, Ky.,
manufacturers of the famous
new treatment for general disa
bility, ?'Hays' Specific," Mr. S.
B. Hughes, one of the most
prominent bankers in the State

For the benefit of aify of my
friends and acquaintances who
may be afflicted with kidney or
liver trouble, I state that I have
found in Hays' Specific an effici
ent remedy and, I believe, a per-
manent enre for myself. For
some time I was a sufferer from
disorder of these organs and
finally resorted to Hay 8' Specific.
It is with no degree of pride tnat
I permit my name to be used to
promote the interest of the man
ufacture of this remedy, but that
it may be of some benefit to my
friends.
