Chicago Jane 12. The Pro
gresaivea have sustained a head-on
collision with their leader. That
fact is manifest. He is to look the
situation over 'and decide what to
do, but we, too, will look the field
over and determine what we will
do. , i ' t
For many weeks it has been evi
dent that the vehement attacks of
Colonel Roosevelt upon the Presi
dent were precluding that free
dom of decision on the part of the
Colonel necessary for the highest
leadership of an " independent
party, with principles of its own
mand a sense of its mission. His
denunciation of Wilson left the
Colonel at the mercy of the Re
publican party. If Wilson is un
believedly bad and so the Col
onel, in the intensity of his oppo
sition, apparently thinks he
cannot hesitate to support the
party which offers numerically
the best promise of the President's
overthrow. ','-.'.: '.-.!' -v
It is this outstanding fact and
its controlling logic which gave
such a sickly hue to the futile
strategy of the Progressive
gotiators" and made the wire to
Oyster Bay, and the messages it
' tarried, irrelevant and immaterial
to a situation, largely of the Col
onel 'a making, and which he tardi
. y recognized. : v . ;
It is easier to get excited about
a subject than to think about it,
and the Progressives propose to do
a little thinking and leave the tan
trums to others. Among other
things they desire to do justice
to a president who has been alled
who has endttwa witSr unflineh
ing steadiness a volume of criti
cism which has no parallel in our
. history since Lincoln's time. .
We recall the answer of Lin
coln to the cry in . 1864, that his
administration was "merely
atumbling along."
It may be true, ' ' said Lincoln,
but. please God, I think we are
stumbling along in the right di
rection." . : .'
If the President has stumbled
" lias it been in the right direction!
This is worthy of a little re
flection, and the Progressives are
thinking.
Bainbridge Colby, a New York
lawyer, made the speech nominat
ing Colonel Roosevelt in the Pro
gressive convention in Chicago
last Saturday. Four years ago he
was one of the -most active work
ers for Roosevelt for the Republi
can nomination for President and
became a Progressive leader in the
1912 campaign. His pamphlet,
"A Stolen . Nomination for the
Presidency," was widely circulat
ed by the Progressives.

MEXICAN BANDITS BAJD
TEXAS RANCH.
Ranch 20 Miles Northwest of
Loredo Raided and 80 Horses c
Driven Off.
San Antonio, Tex., June 11.--Mexican
bandits raided the Cole
man ranch, about 25 miles north
west of Loredo, last night and
were driven back across the bor
der, today by a troop of the Four
teenth Cavalry under Capt. Ola
W. Bell. The bandits drove off
80 horses but did no damage to
the ranch property;
The raid was reported to head-;
quarters by Gen. Wann at Lore
dowho is in charge of the situa
tion. It is expected he will send
re-enforcements to Capt. BelL
who is without pack train or sup
plies. How far into Mexico he
has gone is not known at head
quarters.. The raid was first reported to
Gen. Funston by T. A. Coleman,
of San Antonio, owner of the
ranch, who is in Port Aransas on
a fishing trip. Verification came
from Gen. Bell.
What is regarded by American
army officers as official repudia
tion of the agreement entered in
to by Gens. Pershing and Gavira
was contained in a curt message
from Gen. Jacinto Trevino to Gen.
Pershing, informing him that
Gen. Gavira had no authority to
dismiss military subjects with him.
Gen. Pershing sent a copy of Gen.
Trevino s message to department
headquarters here.
The agreement between Gens.
Pershing and Gavira had to do
with disposition of troops in the
territory controlled by the Ameri
can punitive expedition and was
intended as a precaution that
might prevent unauthorized clash
es. It in no way affected the
more important phases of the sit
uation. :

NUMBER 35
HUGHES AND FAJBBANK8
Republicans Nominate' Supreme
Court Justice in a Conven
tion Utterly Devoid of
Enthusiasm.
Chicago, III., June 10. Charles
Evans Hughes,, former Governor
of New York, and until today Jus
tice of the Supreme Court of the
United States, was today nomi
nated for the presidency by the
Republican National Convention.
Charles Warren Fairbanks of
Indiana, elected Vice President
with Theodore Roosevelt in 1904,
again was chosen for second place
on the Republican ticket.
a Both nominations, made by ov
erwhelming majorities, were by
acclamation made unanimous.
Senator Lodge of Massachusetts
presented by Roosevelt as a com
promise candidate, received 7
votes. Col. Roosevelt himself re
ceived 18 1-2 votes, scattered over
12 states.
The nominating ballot showed
this count :
Hughes, 949 1-2; Roosevelt,
18 1-2; Lodge, 7; Dupont, 5;
Weeks, 3; absent 1. Total, 987.
The convention will go down in
history as utterly lacking in en
thusiasm. The bosses, would not
stand for Roosevelt and the dele
gates meekly submitted and nom
inated who they were told to.
Justice. Hughes sent a telegram
tor Chairman Harding accepting
the nomination and at the same
time sent his resignation as Jus
tice of the United States Supreme
Court to President Wilson by
special messenger.
The President sent this reply to
Justice Hughes' letter:
"Dear Mr. Justice Hughes: I
am in receipt of your letter of
resignation and feel constrained
to yield to your desire. I, there-
fore, accept your resignation as
Justice of the Supreme Court of
the United States, to take effect
at once. Sincerely yours,
WOODROW WILSON."

MISSOURI SUFFRAGISTS
QUIT.
Iowa Defeat Causes Women to.
Withdraw Petitions.
St. Louis, June 8. Announce
ment was made at the Woraan
Suffrage headquarters here today
that petitions for placing a suf
frage amendment on the Missouri
ballot next fall would not be
filed. This decision was reached
as a result of the defeat of wo
man suffrage in Iowa.
It had been planned to file the
petitions after the suffrage dem- '
onstration during the Democratic
national convention, but the com
ing election now is' considered
inopportune.
A woman suffrage amendment
was defeated .at the election of.
1914.
The Missouri organization of
the Women's Christian. Temperance-Union
will not enter any
campaign this fall for suffrage,
according to Mrs. Fannie L. Tay
lor, the chairman for the Kansas
City district Mrs. Anna Gordon,
the national W. C. T. U. president
had been requested by Mrs. v
Carrie Chapman Catt, the nation
al suffrage president, to use her .
influence in preventing sueh a " .
campaign in Missouri on the 1
ground that a second defeat boti
