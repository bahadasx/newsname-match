Marketing Agricultural Prolucta
Much liha beýn said regardiniti
demuonslration wlRk and pro
gres. ive agriculture in genierial in
this paribh: all with a -inr:ere
meaning, but few seem t, see the
truly great need of a cimpetent{
assistant in the right capacity.
There is no question in my
mind but that we neeýd more per
sonal advice on more and better i
crops and better touck thani we
are getting, but why do;'t we get
it? Anyone can answer that
questionl with the great cornmm n
answer--The funds are not
available to secure such service."
That seems strange here in the
Sunny South where climatic con
ditions permit outdoor work the
year iound and the soil can readi
ly be made to produce almost any
crop grown in the United States,
yet such is the case.
It is not a question of produc.
tion but a question of marketing.
It might seem absurd to take
any crop, livestock or anything <
else out'of a community that is
really needed there, but if a cash i
market could be secured for
these products it would be an en- '
couragement for the farmer to 2
grow more than is needed for '
home consumption and the sur- t
plus would bring him that nec- r
essary article called "money" on t:
which all commercial business is
based. b
We are all aware that a bale C
of cotton and a fat cow are the si
only two reliable cash assets the j C
farmer has and until there are p
more there will be complaints of ce
hard times and high taxes. There o
must be some plan by which to H
put more money in the hands of P'
the farmers, whether it be done bi
by the merchant, banker or agri. a'
cultural expert, but I know of no st
one better fitted to do this than !I
our agricultural director. b<
This all trade plan the mer- SC
chants have for butter, chickens, y'
eggs, corn, syrup and all other
products, that they can be per- h;
suaded to handle, is good as far ei
as it goes, but it does not go all se
the way, not even far enough to ri
pay parish taxes. sE
Cotton is not as sure a crop as ti
it has been in the past, but odtr e
land will yield an abundance of it
most other crops. What we '*
want is a market that will give b
us cash returns for the products. ti
When that is accomplished pros. b
perity will smile on the farmers s
and hard times will be banished. s4

Nineteenth Senaturial.,listrict and
auth ir r)f the bill. appeared in its
behalf. During the eurse of his
speech he charged Mr. Heint::.
a member of the committee, with
being in the employ of the brew
eries. He told how thyr repre
re-sentative had iiandamused the
sheriff of Washington Parish to
restrain him from closing ~the
Bogalusa "near-beer" establish.
Claiming the floor at the con
clusion of MJr. Johnson's speech,
IMr- Heintz explained his position
in the matter. He declared he
was employed to defend the
"near-beer" people and that he
acted throughout as an attorney.
Mr. Johnson afterward stated to
the committee that he had meant!I
no reflecton upon the representa
tive.
No action was taken upon the
bill by the committee today.,
Colonel John P. Sullivan, repre
sentative of the breweries of New
Orleans, has not completed the t
presentation of his case and the
committee will meet again at 9:30
o'clock tomorrow to hear him. f
He will ask the committee to re
port the Johnson bill unfavorably a
but if the committee should be n
averse to that stand, he has a
substitute bill. Should that be
rejected Mr. Sullivan has a nunm
ber of amendments to the John
son bill to offer which he has not t
yet made public. c
Mr. Johnson made a plea to a
have the principle of local option v
extended to the regulation of the d
sale of "near-beer" in "dry" ter- t
ritory. "The people of the 'wet' j
sections do not know the 3cndi- a
tions which exist with the pres. F
ence of tLe "near-beer" saloon t
in our 'dry' territory," he said. ii
'.We have been told t-hat "'near- .
beer" is non-intoxicating, but
the fact remains that men and 3
boys go into 'near-beer' saloons d
sober and come out drunk,I have
seen it." The people of the -dry' e

ment iy T. Sambola Jones, of

towns to determine upon whether
'near beer' was to be sold. Mr.
Byrne and Colonel Jones cast
the only twov votes for the amend
ed substitute. On the final vote
on the Johnson bill, both voted I
for a favorable report.
Represent.ºtive, Knonenberger I
and Cooke, of New Orleans, C
made short statements in favor
of the Johnson bill. They de
clared they were local optionists
and believed in giving the dry
sections such regulatory legisla
tion as the "dries" deemed nec
cessary. Frel J. Heintz, repre
sentative from St. Tamany, C
whose name figured in yester
day's hearing as the attorney of
the Bogalusa 'near-beer' saloon
keepers, also made a short talk,
announcing that he would sup
port the measure. He did this
because it did not affect his par
ish, he said, although he was
not a prohibitionist.
Representative Saint, of St.
Mary, told the committee he was S
determined to oppose all "Blue
Sky" legislation wheri he wasf
elected, but had found 'near- u
beer' saloon conditions so bad at U
Hammond, on a recent visit there
iund the demand for their aboli- 5
tron sd insistent by the people of
that section, that he was in favor
of the Johnson bill. e
Mr.aBylrne led another vain P

amnenument to make the Johnson 0
bill effective January 1, 1917, in- e
tead of immediately ater its q
rombngtion. A He e lained t
that it was not just to close the 1
'near-pee4" establishments after v
they had paid their licenses for 0
the year and some provision b
should be made for their relief. 1
Delos Johnson, author of the t
bill, emphatically refused to have l
his measure tampered with in p
any way and the committee voted i
down the amendment. Mr. John. b
son promised that a bill provid- ti
ing for the refunding of all near- e
beer licenses would follow his
bill through the Legislature. 'I
