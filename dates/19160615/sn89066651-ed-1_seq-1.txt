EXCESSIVE RAINS.
George W. Hutson of the Con
cord neighborhood, one of the
most successful cotton farmers
in the county, was here Tues
day, and desiring to keep posted
on county affairs, paid for the
Herald to visit him one year. Mr.
Hutson has a large crop of cot
ton and works about thirty hands
all the time. He says he has had
no trouble on account of the
scarcity of labor, but that ex
cessive rains have given con
siderable trouble, and that tHe
crop of the county, as a whole,
is in a very unsatisfactory con
dition, which will grow much
worse if the present series of
rains do not shortly cease.

homestead adjoining Hayti, and

son, Harry, and two sisters
Mrs. S. V. Gordon of Kansas and
Mrs. C. D. Tresenriter.
This city had a dog law in
force and was enforcing it, too.

altogether too many worthless
dogs running the streets in
Hayti.

on land in Dunklin, Pemiscot and

This has been done several
times, but as yet we don't see
any oil flowing.

Russell's Nomination Certain.
It is now certain that this gen
tleman will be nominated as the
Democratic candidate for Con
gress in tho Fourteenth Dis
trict without opposition, and is
pretty sure to be re-elected next
November.
This is right and best for the
people of our district. He has
grown to be one of the most
popular and influential men in
the House, and we are all proud
of the splendid record he has
made by his accomplishments.
He is not only the representative
of the Democrats of this district,
but of the individual Republicans
as well. No person ever wrote
him at' Washington invoking his
aid in legitimate official business
that did not receive a courteous
and prompt reply and have his
best efforts. He has never cared
or inquired as to the politics of
the men asking his assistance.
If a citizen of this district, Mr.
Russell gave his request prompt
and efficient attention.
Congressman Russell is the
right man to represent this dis
trict and it is not possible that
he will be defeated next Novem
ber. We need him at Washing
ton. New Madrid Record.
Another City to Pave.
The board of Aldermen on last
Tuesday met to receive bids for
the paving of one-half mile on
of Washington avenue, being that
portion from College avenue west
to "D" street.
Although several contractors
had gone over the plans and
specifications and had expressed
their intention of bidding on the
job and two of them were pres
ent, Mr. Carmean was the only
one to tile his bid; but as it was
within the estimate and con
ceded by all to be reasonable,
the work was awarded to him.
Mr. Carmean has been devot
ing his time to concrete work for
a number of years, lias laid prac
tically all of Ivennett's many
miles of concrete walks, and his
work has always been of the
highest order; and tho property
owners inteif.-trd, ;i I of whom
are his puronnl li ieiid.-,arc glad I
he secured the work.
This will be the first piece of
paving for our city, but it will be
closely followed by several other
contracts; and, as with concrete
sidewnlks, the interest will
grow until it covers the city, and
it will not be long until all
our streets are paved. Kennett

A Good Offer.
Gee Whiz! Some of the state
candidates are certainly liberal
hearted. This week we received
a regular letter from a state can
didate seeking the office of Secre
tary of State, and in which he
lost no time in paying compli
ments and asking that we devote
space each week for the month
of July for the interest of his
candidacy. And all this for
thanks. No, no. Not much,
Mary Ann. Space in the Hayti
Herald is for sale, and for cash,
not for trade.
And, if you please, he sent
along a lot of roprint everything
ready to set, quite accomodating,
we don't think.
Our columns are open to all
advertisers for a legitimate busi
ness, and any candidate may have
space if they send the money
I along with the copy.

Are You a Sound
Sleeper?
What I mean is, are you one of the
kind that sleeps so sound you do not hear
the thief prowling around, and then, af
ter the mischief is done, you lock
everything securely? That kind of pre
paredness is worth nothing.
The man who is so careless or so
set in his ways that he lets his dollars
slip away without anything to show for
them is as bad as the man who locks his
barn after his horse is stolen.
With each five dollars of cash trade we give
a premium. They are constant reminders and,
we hope, pleasing tokens of our appreciation of
your patronage.
Get out of the rut! Protect yourself
and your possessions. Sleep well, but
sleep lightly, and trade with
