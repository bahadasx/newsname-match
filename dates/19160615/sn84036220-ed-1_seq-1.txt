BRYAN, SPEC TATOR, WEEKS W ITH EMOTION
ST. LOUIS, June 14.—The demo-rover
cratlc national convention at its first
session today heard the keynote of
Americanism and peace, preparedness
and prosperity sounded by former
Governor Glynn of New York, as tem
porary chairman, and, with u high
pitch of enthusiasm emphatically reg
istered by demonstration after dcmon
■■tration its approval of President Wil
son's peaceful conduct of foreign af
fairs.
The convention, which had gotten
t nder way with such perfunctor/ dem
onstrations as mark every national
gathering of the kind, soon stirried it
self into roaring cheers as Chairman
Glynn cited historic parallels to show
that other presidents, including repub
licans, has adjusted threatening for
eign situations without resort to war.
"The policy of the administialion,"
lie declared, "lias been just as Ameri
can as the American flag itself.'' He
went down the list.i of presidents, re
counting their action to avoid war,
the delegates catching the spit it of
ills argument and as he referred to
each particular president some dele
gate would call: "What did he do?"
"He settled the trouble by negotia
tion" was the reply which Glynn in
variably returned and the convention
would roar its approval.
William ,T. Bryan, as a newspaper
correspondent in the press stand,
wept with emotion as Glynn pictured
the victories of peace, but he laughed
with the crowd when a Texas delegate,
interrupting Glynn, leaped to his chair
and cried:
"And don't forget that policy also
is satisfactory to William Jennings
Bryan."
Aside from a 16-minute demonstra
tion when Chairman Glynn predicted
President Wilson's re-election, Glynn's
speech was sprinkled with demonstra
tions which he found it difficult to
stem so he could go on. So it was
plain that the telling points on the
delegates were the recital of Presi
dent Wilson's efforts to keep the coun
try at peace.
"Tills policy," lie said, "may not
satisfy the lire eater and the swash
buckler. But it does satisfy the
mothers of the land at whose Hearth
and fireside no jingoistic war lias
placed an empty chair. It does satisfy
the daughters of this land from whom
bluster and brag have sent no loving
brother to the dissolution of the grave.
It does satisfy the fathers of this land
and the sons of this land, who will
fight for our flag and die for our flag
when reason primes the rifle; when
honor draws the sword and when jus
tice breathes a blessing on the stand
ard they uphold."
The last of the words were drowned
out In a roar of applause that swept
the Coliseum.
"Repeat it," cried the delegates, "re
peat It."
"All right, be quiet and I'll repeat
it," responded Glynn, and he did to
applause and cheering.
No other president since ttie Civil
war, Glynn told the convention, had
faced such crucial problems, none had
displayed a grasp of statesmanship
more profound.
"Whether the course the country
has pursued during this crucial period
is to he continued and whether the
principles that liava been asserted as
our national policy shall lie indorsed 1
or withdrawn," Glynn told the cottveu- !
tion, was the paramount question for I
the voter to decide. "No lesser issue !
must cloud it," said he, "no unrelated j
problems must confuse it."
After hearing the keynote speech, j
the convention adjourned until 11 j
o'clock tomorrow. Committees then
went in session to prepare their work I
for tlie session.
Today the big Coliseum, holding
about 12,000 persons, practically was
filled and, despite a constantly rising
temperature, it was fairly comfort
|
able. On their way to the convention
hall, the delegates passed between ;
lines of suffragists spread along 12 j
blocks of Locust street, the most j
travelled route to the Coliseum. The j
suffragists, seated on chairs ranged :
along the curbs, were arrayed in white ,
and yellow and held yellow parasols. |
The waving lines of yellow gave the j
demonstration the popular name "gold-j

Chairman McCombs' Address.
In calling the democratic national
convention to order at noon today,
Chairman William F. McCombs of the
democratic national committee, spoke
as follows
"Ladies and Gentleman of the Con-i
vention: We are in an atmosphere of
victory. We have no feeling of guess,
but a spirit of certainty. We are here
to celebrate the marvelous achieve
ments of the democratic party, since
it came into power and to place a mile
stone upon the path of its future.
"Over two years ago an old slave
related the fable of the frog, whojt'
wunted to grow to the size of an
pliant. Such was the ambition of liis
soul that his body swelled to a mar
vicious proportion. Indeed, Aesop wont!
so far as to predict that tlie frog,
upon reaching the size of the elephant,
would burst. I commend to your no
tlce the wisdom of Aesop. It took
2,000 years for his prophecy to
come true. Only last week the frog
elephant, or the elephant frog—ex
ploded. The republican party for years
succeeded in deceiving the country.
Now it is successfully deceiving itself.
In its platform it offers pulchritidlnous
promises but with vacuous intent. It
promises the country, in the main,
wliut tlie democratic party lias already
done, or is Ui the process of doing,
saving always, the bogus god, "Pro
tection.' It lias cloaked Us iniquity
with a judicial robe but Hie cloven
hoof of splint still protrudes
"The board' of directors lias sat in
Chicago and again resolved that they
are the country. Ttiey have adopted
the doctrines foreordination and pre
destination hut have made it applica
ble only to themselves.
"Tlie rest of the people are their
wards—for profit. Ambition is a no
ble attribute, but when it is adulter
ated with a greed a cataclysm is in
evitable. We have recently witnessed
the painful spectacle of the American
parties at Chicago, putting self in
place of ideals; self-glorification in
place of national honor; republicanism
and progressivism so-called, in place

It hails the man, who has asserted
this Americanism, assured this
peace, advocated this preparedness
and produced this prosperity. The
man who is president of the United
States today has measured up to
the best traditions of a great of
fice. No president since the civil
war has had as crucial problems
to solve; and no president has dis
played a grasp more sure, a states
manship more profound.
The policy of the administration
has been just as American as the
American flag it self. This policy,
may not satisfy the fire eater and
the swashbuckler; but it does sat
isfy the mothers of the land at
whose hearth and fireside no jingo

It does satisfy the daughters of this

WHO WAS AN EX-SHEHIFF.
BELIEVES HE HAS BEEN MURDERED
In a meeting of the directors of the
Bank of Fergus County, Held yester
day morning, James 10. Woodard,
formerly of Roundup, was elected to
tlie office of cashier of the bank to
succeed Austin W. Warr. Mr. Warr
was elected to the office of vice presi
dent, and T. T. Taylor, formerly as
sistant cashier, was also elected vice
president. P. J. Oaweiller, formerly
assistant cashier, resigned his posi
tion some time ago to take charge of
land interests in this and other parts
ol tlie state, keeping his deadquarters
in Lewistown. There will he no as
sistant cashier of this bank for the
present.
Mr. Woodard, Hie newly-elected
ashler, came to Montana 12 years ago
from Nebraska, liis native state. Un
til two months ago Mr. Woodard lias
held the position of president and
general manager of the Roundup Coal
Mining company. He is also president
of the Roundup Water company and
president of the State of Montana Ad
vancement company, which, among
t Her lines of endeavor, publishes
"Montana," with B. T. Stanton of Hel
ena as secretary and editor. Through
this company and liis other tarreacli
irig interests, Mi. Woodard has prob
ably done as much as any other man
in the northwest in promoting the in
dustrial advancement and prosperity
which Montana lias enjoyed during ttie
past, decade. He has an enviable per
sonal acquaintance among men pow
erful in business and finance all over
tlie country, and, although, he is a
joung man, he is exceptionally well
qualified to assume liis new duties
and all the .attending responsibilities.
"This lias been coming about for
three years," said A. W. Warr yester
day, in commenting on the changes.
"I, myself, will remain actively en
gaged witli the hank for a long time to
ccine, but 1 am hoping that each year
will lessen my responsibilities and al
low me to devote some of my time to
other things I desire to do. 1 am
particularly gratified that, the cashier's
office has been filled by so capable
a man as Mr. Woodard, for I feel lliat
the bank's interests could not have
been better served."
Ill & HAME Will PREPARE THE
PLANS FOR MONTANA BUILDING
II lias been practically decided Unit
plans for the Montana building to be
erected on the corner of Third avenue
and Main street will be drawn by Link
A- Haire and the building will be done
by the Sound Construction company
of Seattle. While no formal contracts
havo been let, it is reasonably sure
the firms named will undertake the
work.
The building will be six stories, and
perhaps the finest of its size in the
slate. All details will be carefully
worked out with this fact ill view.
Work will start in the immediate fu
luro and it is hoped to have tlie build
ing completely ready for occupation
in about eight months.

DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM IN BRIEF
ST. LOUIS, June 14.—President Wil-1
son's plank on Americanism for the
democratic platform, practically cliarg-'
ing a conspiracy by some foreign-born
citizens to influence foreign and in-1
ternal affairs for the benefit of other
government, and condemning any or
ganization countenancing such move-1
ments, as well as any political party
which by failure to repudiate such a
conspiracy receives the benefit of it
at the ballot box, was telegraphed
here tonight from Wasthngton and
placed before democratic leaders.
As the resolutions committee, which
will draft the platform and pass on
the plank was engaged at a late hour
tonight in continuing public hearings
of persons urging various declarations
in the platform, the plank which has
the presidents' approval and which
promises to be sensation of the demo

every flagstaff in Dewistown yester
day, and in udditiujh to this nearly
very auto was decljjjfcd out with flags
while hundreds of cifjzens wore minia

Formal exercises 'were carried out
hv file Elks at Elks hall last evening,
there being a very large attendance.
Prior to this gathering the Trumpet
Corps, led by Joel Steiner, paraded
Main street. Tlie trumpeters did not
wear their new uniforms as bad been
planned, because tliiy had not all ar
rived, but they made a favorable iin
pression with their stirring music.
Dr. Frank Hagstrom, exalted ruler
of the local lodge, presided at
tlie ball and tlie Elks ceremonies were
carried out impressively; Dr. Gauss
offered tlie prayer and later read the
president's proclamation, while Merle
C. Groene gave the flag record and
Frank Clark gave the Elks tribute
to tlie flag An instrumental trio ren
dered several sele iipns and l r. T
li. Pleasants read a beautiful tribute
to the flag that hud attracted bis at
tention. Dick Baker sang two pa
triotic selections and Win. H. Smith
delivered the oration. Mr. Smith's sub
ject was: "Our Flag—Pride of this Na

Mr. Smith's Address.
In these days of monstrous war,
when common rights of common peo

cratic platform, was not formally con
sidered and probably will not be un
til tomorrow when the sub committee
which makes the final draft of tlie
platform lias its meeting.
There was very guarded talk about
the president's plank tonight because
all the leaders agreed that practically
everything depended upon the
phraseology in which it finally found
its way into the platform and they
did not propose to risk any leaks
which might prove embarrassing later.
Tlie convention's boundless enthusi
asm today whenever the issue of
Americanism was touched upon gave
evidence that tlie president's plank
would go into the platform In some
terms, but it is certain to be the sub
ject of extended and careful delibera

the platform was named: Senator

VERDICT IN "The farming case
The case of W. II Nilsclike, jointly
charged with Lewis Eddy witli con
spiracy in the theft of goods from tlie
stock of the Hweltzer store, was at
last taken up for trial in the district
court yesterday morning. The speci
fic charge in Ibis case is the theft
of an overcoat in January last. The
stale's most Important witnesses were
examined during the day, Hut It will
require all of to'day at least to com
plete the trial. The Jurors are Clyde

J. I). Slanger, J. E. Parker, Sam Lutz,
J. T. Stanley, It. F. Quaititunce, A. 10.

W. Bidden, represented the slate, and
.1. c. Huntoon, of Blaekfortl K llun
toon appeared for the defendant,
Nltselike, Eddy having weeks ago fled
and being now a fugitive from justice.
The state's first witness was Ernest
I til I lard, who related the circumstances
of tlie transaction upon whleli this
charge Ih bused. He testified to being
approached by Eddy witli a proposition
to Huy a cost very cheap and took
him over to Hweitzer's, where Nilsclike
sold him the coat In question. He
walked out of the store witli Eddy,
and going across (lie street paid Eddy
the price lie fixed, $5. Eddy present
ed him witli a pair of gloves, saying,
"Here Is a present for you." Mr. Bul
lard knew nothing whatever about the
arrangements between Eddy umt
Nltselike and suposed when the former
approached him that It was an ordi
nary transaction.
Mrs. E. C. Bennett, who was cashier
at the Hweltzer store ut the time of
this occurrence, testified to the fact
;tlial no cash was turned In nor wuh
any charge made witli reference to the
sale of this overcoat, so far us shown
by the records.
E. ('. Hweltzer testified to having
gone to a cabin occupied by Eddy and
a woman (Eddy's wife has since sued
iiini for divorce), and a lot of ties,
shirt waists and pieces of silk were
produced by Eddy, who said they all
came from the Hweltzer store, and
that lie got them from Nltschke. Mr.
Hweltzer testified that lie never au
tliorized Nltselike to let goods leave
the store without a sales slip,
Frank C. Lavlgne. the chief stock
inspector, testified that he took up
this case at the request of Chief E.
W. Ray and in January last took
Nitschke in custody and escorted him
to the police station, where, in the
presence of Chief Ray, the defendant
was given a lengthy examination.
Nltselike made some conflicting state
ments, .-.aid tli~ witness, and seemed
somewhat confused when questioned
about Hie oveuoat. The defendant
seemed to be frank and expressed a
willingness to have them search liis
room. He assisted them in that and
four tags, supposed to be from goods
from Sweitzer's were found in a suit
case. To Mr. Belden this witness went
over the conversation in detail, but
Mr. Huntoon quickly drew from him
several additional statements made by
Nitschke, in which lie absolutely de

It; and there are those at this mo
ment who are trying to levy a species
of political blackmail, saying 'Do what
we wish in the interest of f,sen
tluient or we will wreak our voiiri mien
at tin' polls.' That is the sort of thing
against which the American nation
will turn witli a mighty triumph of
sentiment which will teach these gen
tlemen once for all tliut loyalty to
this flag is the first test of tolerant.i
in the United States."

PLANK ON AMERICANISM.
WASHINGTON, June 14.—President
Wilson today approved a plank on
Americanism for the democratic plat
form which arraigns individuals or al
liances seeking to embarrass the gov
ernment in negotiations witli foreign
nations and condemns any political
party which modifies its policy for
fear of political consequences.
The president decided to challenge
openly Americans of alien bir!lt op
posing IiIh foreign policies. Learning
from editorials In some foreign lan
guage newspapers that they were sup

Wilson sent word to his personal rep

of foreign nations in relations be

countries.
Reports that efforts were to be made
at St. l»uis to put into the platform
a declaration in favor of embargo on
arms, and other proposals which tlie
president considers linneutral,
strengthened Mr. Wilson in his deter
mination to meet the so-called hyphen*
tiled issue as conclusively as possible,
Many telegrams warmly praising tlie
keynote speech of former Governor
Glynn at St. Louis came to tlie presi
dent tonight from delegates lo the con
vention. Mr. Wilson seemed much
pleased, particularly at the reception
of the temporary chairmun's tribute
to the course of tlie administration In
keeping the nation out of war. It has
been understood that declaration sup

nard Baruch, a New York financier,

the president.
