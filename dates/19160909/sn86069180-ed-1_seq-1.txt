Ilns the Most Prosperous Class
of Any in the United
Kingdom.
Glass of Farmers. Who Can Not

Balances in Savings Institutions
Evidences of the Unusual
Prosperity.
SPEAK REVERENTLY OF CASEMENT
J. H. Donnelly writes that two
months' travel In Ireland, meeting
mostly land owners, peasants and
agricultural laborers, bring forth
the conclusion that they are the
most prosperous class of any In the
United Kingdom, and being free
from conscription they have re
mained at home for tho most part.
Receiving war prices for their
products, despite the high cost of
living, very many farmers have
earned and saved more in one year
than in any previous two or three
years. The last hold which the
Redmond party has on many farm
ing constituencies may bo ascribed
to tho accepted faith in the claim
of the Irish Parliamentary party
that tho Irishman is exempt from
conscription.
The late Sir Charles. Wyndham
proved to bo the one really valuable
English benefactor of Ireland when,
as a leader of the Tory party, he
secured the passage of tho land act
which bears his name. Prior to
the land purchase act of 1903 the
farm laborers averaged $2.72 wages
per week and a hovel to sleep in;
now he Is earning $6 per week and
has a modest, neat cottage of his
own. He is making a decent living
and he can not be made to see why
he should leave the land to avenge
Belgium in Flanders, Serbia, Turkey
or Africa. He just wants work and
to be left alone. They aro sullen,
quiet and bitter in their enmity to
ward England, despite access to the
land, because they believe they had
been deprived for centuries of the
xight to theJand.ot their..Qwjxcquni
try. The placing of the tenant on
the small farm, the tenant who paid
$80 a year rent and has since se
cured an interest in or ownership
of his land by paying $G0 per year,
has made a class of farmers cling
ing to the land who can not be
drawn into the war.
There existB In England and Scot
land a feeling of jealousy and en
gendered hate because the Irish
peasant is free from army service
and he is denounced severely as the
chief slackers of the country. Few
of these peasant laborers dare leave
Ireland for employment In England.
They have been mobbed in several
English cities. No matter what may
bo said to the contrary, the average
Englishman of all but the more in
tellectual class justifies tho killing
of the Irish rebels and no small
part of that raco hatred at present
Is roused by the spectacle that an
Englishman, of the governing race,
must die in the trenches while the
Irish farmer is exempt and Is get
ting high prices for his products
and growing prosperous as the re
sult of the sacrifices and sufferings
of the English race. That the Irish
farmer, as a rule, is indifferent to
tho outcome of the war can not bo
doubted-after listening to their com
ment. They look on at recruiting
meetings and say little, but gather
In knots whispering among them
selves. They seldom show up at
political meetings.
It is certain there aro few coun
ties in Ireland, and I have visited
twenty-one, but would rise in re
bellion if the boys and men of mili
tary age were torn from the farms
they have recently acquired or tho
laborer taken from his tiled cottage.
England after a long and costly ex
perience loes not bank heavily on
securing recruits irom una cims.
Good Judges figure that from this
agricultural element the War De
partment has secured scarcely one
out of every fourteen available men
and the material Is there for fine
and hardy troops. The operations
of the land purchase act, so far as
new funds are provided, has been
practically suspended during the
war. But there are nearly 500,000
tenants who either own the land
or have made payments on their es
tates. The Irish farmer lost hope
of home rule early In the war, and
tho result of the recent fiasco in
Parliament he knows completes the
burial of the act, but he was pre
pared for failure and Is relieved at
the failure of the partition plan.
He desires peace and security, but
the woes of centuries have made
hlra Indifferent to the fate of the
great empire which neglected him
too long. Tho farmers often speak
of the Zeppelins attacking England
and seem to take It for granted that
Ireland Is immune irom ai
warfare. They speak reverently of
the death of Sir Roger Casement,
although they knew little of his
work save that he died bravely and
for Ireland. .,,
With ready money in his nandB
the farmer is able to buy improve
ments and Ford cars are common.
The war has enabled him to produce
green crops which are quickly con
sumed and at good prices. The po
tato crop looks well. The exports
of Irish bacon are heavy and the
prlee Is satisfactory. Irish hams
' and lamb are bringing unheard of
prim. The steady increase in
farmers' balances In savings Institu
tions and the rcthement of loans Is
evidence of the unusual prosperity
of the Irish farmer In wartime.
MEXICAN LIBERTY.
In spite of the fact that Mr.
Carranza and his friends keep In
sisting that Mexico already has re
ligious liberty, the persecution con
tinues. Only recently In Orilla
somo young women of the very bestj
families gathered the little children
together In a house near a church
formerly in chnrgo of tho Jesuit
Fathers. There were two secular
priests left In tho church. Gov.
Elizondo, hearing that tho women
were instructing the children In
catechism, sent a Colonel with a
number of soldiers to break up this
"Illicit gathering." In order to
frighten the women their names
wore taken, tho priests arrested.
Father Valiejo, sixty years old. a
man who had suffered already a
stroke of paralysis, and was at the
time of his arrest suffering also
from diabetes, was lodged In jail,
forced to sweep tho courtyard,
where the soldiers were kept, and
clean out the water closets. His
"crime" Is the same as that of the
women that of teaching catechism,
or rather permitting It to bo taught
In a building adjacent to the
church.
Mr. Carranza promised President
Wilson that he would grant relig
ious liberty In Mexlcd. His Govern
ment informed the Governments of
the United States and many South
American-, republics, as well as
Great Britain and Spain, that re
ligious liberty already existed In
Mexico; but nono of tho Govern
ments, except our own, has been
deceived. It is true that priests
have not of lato been killed, nor
have Sisters of late been outraged.
At least no news of Buch occur
rences has come. But Father
Valiejo, the priest above referred
to. was taken away from Mbrelia
and has not been heard of since
Just as seven priests of Zacatecas
were taken awny and conveniently
lost. Yot there are Catholics who
believe that those who are trying
to get justice for the stricken
church in Mexico are too "drastic."

Denounce Georgia Bigots For
Their Scurrilous Attack on
Bishop Kcilcy.
Hundreds of Delegates Write
Open Letter to State Senator
Iiawrcncc.
Noble Defense of the Great Pre
late and Brave Confederate
Soldier.
AN AFFRONT AND AN INSULT
One of the worst set-backs tho
bigots of the South have, received in
the past few years came out of the
convent "Inspection" bill that re
cently passed the Legislature In
Georgia. In reply to a statement
nah, against the "inspection" bill,
Senator McCrory rose to a point of
personal privilege upon the floor of
tho Georgia Senate and made a
vicious attack upon Bishop Keiley.
Senator Lawrence, of the First dis
trict, In which Savannah is located,
replied to Senator McCiory in de
fense of the Bishop.
The Fraternal Order of Eagles
was in national convention at
Savannah at the time of this scur
rilous attack on Bishop Keiley, and
promptly let the people of Georgia
know just how the outside world
viewed the bigots of Georgia. The
following letter signed by hundreds
of delegates and drawn up by E. J.
Shannahan, of Kansas City, was
Bent to Senator Lawrence and also
published in all the dally .papers of
Savannah:
Hon. A. A. Lawrence, Atlanta,
Georgia Dear Sir: The Fraternal
Order of Eagles Is a patriotic and
fraternal organization composed of
over four hundred thousand mem
bers, residing In every State In the
Union. It is non-sectarian, includ
ing within its membership adher
ents of all religious beliefs. Men
Irrespective of tholr nationality, re
ligion or politics stand on a basis
of absolute equality in this order.
Since sojourning here as the
guests of the city of Savannah and
of the State of Georgia we have
been shocked and mortified to read
in the dally press that in the Senate
of tho great State of Georgia a pub
lic official elected by the people
made a vicious assault upon tho
pergonal character of tho Right Rev.
Benjamin J. Keiley, Roman Catholic
Bishop of Savannah. The language
of thle assault is bo vile, brutal and
un-American as to call forth the re
sentment and condemnation of ev
ery fair-minded and self-respecting
American citizen.
The attack upon this distin
guished citizen of your State, whose
services In the Confederate army
aro a part of your cherished history,
dqes not only Inflict upon him a
grave injustice and violate the
Sacred principles of the American
constitution, but is HKewise an ai
front and an insult to the many
thouHands of American citizens of
the Roman Catholic faith who are
at this time guests of the State of
Georgia.
It Is with pleasure mat we reau
of your manly reply to this outburst
of bigotry and personal abuse. Your
remarks breathe the true American
spirit and will appeal as Just and
right to every fair-minded and pa
triotic American citizen who be
lieves In the principles of religious
liberty as guaranteed to all by the
constitution of our country.
We whose names are subscribed
hereto are among the delegates at
tending the national convention of
the Fraternal Order of Eagles In
Savannah. We belong to various
religious, political and fraternal
bodies, and as your fellow-cltlzens
we desire to express to you our
whole-hearted appreciation of your
fearless and outspoken defense of
American principles.
YourB very truly.

From a member of the

OLD COERCION ACT KEPT READY
From tho second of three articles
written for the New York American
by Dr. Arthur Lynch, M. P., after
a three weeks' visit to Ireland, the
following extracts' are taken :,
hThe'quest-forrOf goVl'l nliieM "IE
Ireland has tried the thinking pow
ers of the Cabinet severely, and the
amount of thought available has
been lamentably inadequate to a
solution of the problem. Mr. As
qulth declared after his return from
Ireland that tho old system of gov
ernment by a Chief Secretary and
Lord Lieutenant, with tho assistance
of Dublin Castle, had completely
broken down, and that In saying
so he expressed the opinion of men
In every condition of life and poll
tics In Ireland. Yet that Is the sys
tem to which he has reverted.
Let us glance for a moment at
Lloyd-George's solution, not to
wrangle over past history, but sim
ply to indicate the main guiding
lines that influenced his action. In
the first place, touching Lloyd
George personally, excellent man
though he is, brilliant as his work
has been in social reform, he knows
little of Ireland, and he never has
been credited with being a con
vinced supporter of home rule.
When therefore I heaid that Lloyd
George had risen in his strength
and was "going to settle the Irish
question," I confess I saw in this
less of solicitude for Ireland than
of a desire to escape from his own
cloud of unpopularity by a bold,
splendid effort. Moreover, Lloyd
George was influenced by the ques
tion of the Presidential election In
tho United States, for it is well
known that he attaches great im
portance to the attitude of America,
especially in regard to the blockade,
and he had got the notion into his
head that Col. Roosevelt would se
curo the nomination of the Repub
lican party, and that all would be
well. The danger he thought lay
In an Irish-German alliance, and to
obviate that movement he desired
to solve the Irish difficulty and to
reconcile to the cause of the Allies
the Irish of America. His plan for
carrying this laudable intention con
sisted in the dismembermont of Ire
land and the holding up, in clear,
concrete form, before the world the
failure of Irish hopes, the dreams
and ideals of a century.
Lloyd-George's calculations came
to grief, but nevertheless since the
repression of the rebellion Ireland
has' been under martial law. I have
heard it stated, and whether It is
true or not it Is believed in Ire
land, that Gen. Maxwell paid a visit
to Archbishop Walsh and com
manded him not to allow requiem
services for tho dead leaders of the
rebellion. This might also be called
a military step; but In that case
wnat Is there witnin me wnoie
scope of arbitrary Interference with
liberty in Ireland that might not
be defended on the ground of mili
tary precaution? The great quali
ties even of a military ruler if he
Is to achieve even a moderate de
gree of success are insight and tact,
backed by a knowledge of Irish
conditions. In all these Gen. Max
well Is conspicuously lacking, and
If the ultimate aim of the Govern
ment be the pacification and re
conciliation of the Irish people, then
the progress of Gen. Maxwell since
he first became virtual dictator oi
Ireland has been marked by blunder
on blunder.
Mr. Duke, the new Chief Secre
tary, la a Devonshire man, a Tory,
a good lawyer and mediocre poli
tician, who had attracted no atten
tion in the House until of late he
began to back up the Government
and to defend them In awkward
passes. Such a man is more prized
on the front bench than a brilliant
man; he is dubbed a Bafa man. Mr.
Duko is conciliatory, but his con
ciliation has hitherto taken this
form: He says it is true martial law
prevails In Ireland, but that it is
only a name and hurts no one who
lives a law-abiding life and does not
meddle with politics.
Speaking as a member of Parlia
ment, I can say that I know of no
Instance In which I have been able
to Intervene directly for the good
of my constituency, and that where
as I entered public life full of en
ergy, hope and determination to do
something to uplift the country, and
though I have studied and advo
cated many fruitful schemes of bet
terment, I have always found my ef
forts thwarted because the Govern
ment Is represented by a great Inert
machine, exceedingly costly and bur
densome to tho people, but con
ceived originally as an instrument
of subjugation and set to work
since always in an anti-national
spirit.
Yes, it is true, as the good Mr.
Duke says, If you take no notice of
any of these matters you can live
with little molestation In Ireland.

KLING CHOICE OF THE PEOPLE
Tho Democratic State campaign
will open in tho proverbial blaze of
glory at Winchester today and asido
from the addresses by Vice Presi
dent Thomas R. Marshall and Rep
resentative Hclfln, of Alabama, a
big baibecue will be the feature.
The Committee of Arrangements
plan to entertain a crowd of 20,000
people, as special tialns are being
run fiom surrounding sections.
Judging from the Interest shown
In the campaign throughout tho
State there is no doubt of tho re
sult in November. It is amusing to
read tho interviews with Republican
Leader Hert, tho present big gun
in this section, who after his daily
saying of "everything looks rosy In
the West" concludes with the state
ment that Hughes has a good
chance to carry Kentucky. If Mr.
Hert's rosy predictions of the West
have no brighter prospects than tho
Republican outlook In Kentucky
then Hughes will be the worst
beaten man ever put up as the G. O.
P. standard-bearer. The reception
to Hughes this past week at Lexing
ton is but typical of the progress
of his campaign everywhere.
He has met with big crowds ev
erywhere with tho same result. Ev
eryone comes away disappointed,,
his addresses consisting of tirades
of President Wilson and scolding ot
the administration, but to tho
chagrin of the Republicans he does
not come out flat-footed and say
what he would have done In Wil
son's place or what he Intends to
do if elected. Tho ten pointed
questions fired at him by the lead
ing wrltera and literary-men he has"
never noticed, although published
fnv. big: newspaper, advertisraeata,,
juliereyei? ib- tfiS-Ksied,, JSlgllfc.
galling to Roosevelt, who although,
a rand-stana player can not be ac
cused of dodging the issue. It is
dollars to doughnuts that Teddy is
Insisting on the campaign directors
forcing Hughes to answer, but It la
believed it is too late now, as thou
sands of Republicans are disgusted
with Hughes' dodging, whilo tho
Progressives aro deserting by tho
wholesale. Another sourco ot
strength that is not coming up to
expectations of the G. O. P. is tho
German-American vote, which they
had counted on so much. To begiu
with, as contended before in these
columns, the German-American vote
has always been 70 per cent. Re
publican and the Democratic German-American
voter' can see no
reason to desort Wilson when it is
taken into account that Roosevelt,
of tho other camp, went clear out
of his way to Insult the German
Americans and is still at It dally..
The controversy over tho selec
tion of Election Commissioners has
again exposed tho hand of Percy
Haly In Kentucky politics, showing
that ho is making the fight of his
life to stake a comeback and that
he plans to save Beckham when the
latter is a candidate for re-election.
Knowing that Kentucky Democracy
has washed its hands of both Beck
ham and Haly forever, an attempt Is
being made to form a combination
with the Republicans and Prohibi
tionists. This attempt of Haly and
his followers to cause trouble dur
ing tho campaign will not be for
gotten by the men now actively en
gaged in placing the State In tho
Wilson column, and with the Presi
dential race out of the way atten
tion will be directed to the Haly
clique and their little plans nipped
in the bud. It has been rumored
and never denied that Haly and hl3
little coterie of renegade Democrats
were behind Axton and the Bull
Moose paity in 1913, the plan then
being to kill tho Democratic or
ganization here because It would
not bow to Beckham. So the com
bination now with the Republicans
would only again bo a like proced
ure, and It behooves the Kentucky
Democracy to take steps to deliver
another crushing blow similar to
that given Haly's man McChesney
In last year's prlmray.
Local attentlpn is being directed
to the contest for members of tho
Board of Education and the Impres
sion will not down that many
voters aro now going to support Ben
Kllng in November, principally be
cause of the fact that it is believed
now to bo high tlmo for the people
to have a representative in tho
School Board. The manner ot
selecting the present board Is ob
noxious to the people as a rule and
the average voter rebels at the Idea
of any set or, clique of men saying
