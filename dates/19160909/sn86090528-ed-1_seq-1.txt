ADVISABILITY OF
BONDS CONSIDERED
Plan to Improve Highways Connecting
Main Markets; Ozark Trail Boosters
Get Down to Business
According to plans formulated at a
mooting held at the office of tho Com
mercial and Farm bureau Friday even
ing, a series of good roads meetings
will be held in the various towns In
Grady county during tho early part of
next week, culminating in a big meet
ing at the county fair here next Satur
day at which time it is expected that a
general plan of improvement will be
agreed upon whereby all of the market
centers of the county will be connected
by first class highways. The advisa
bility of a bond itssue for roads and
bridges will also be considered at the
same time.
The meeting of the directors of the
bureau, in charge of President Cook,
and that of the local Ozark Trail asso
ciation, presided over by President K.
K. Colby, both took up road matters
after tho former had disposed of rou
tine business. In addition to the fore
going action, tho Ozark Trailers got
down to business on their own propo
sition and it was decidod to take steps
at once for the improvement of the
road leading directly north from Chiek
asha to Pocasset, east of the Rock Is
land railway. County Highway Engi
neer Colby estimated that for this pur
pose about 80O would bo required in
addition to tho amount which tho coun
ty commissioners have available for
use there. To raise this sum, all au
tomobile owners will be asked to join
the Ozark Trail association and con
tribute to the necessary fund. Presi
dent Colby will appoint a committee
to go forth and garner in the coin.
Will Bridge Canadian.
Hegarding the Ozark Trail, Mr. Col
by stated that he had Information to
the effect that Oklahoma City people
will carry out their plan to bridge the
Canadian river at Newcastle and the
only feasible routo for the trail would
bo through that point, thence to Tut
tle and Minco and then to Chickasha
and west to Verden. It is necessary
to improve the road to Pocasset east
of the railroad, otherwise the west
road would be selected and tourists
would not pass through Chickasha.
Two Routes Considered.
From Anadarko west two rputes for
the Ozark Trail are being considered,
one through Hobart and Mangum and
the other through Lawton. Mr. Colby
suggested that Chic-kasha, was not es
pecially interested In what route was
chosen west of this place and that neu
trality would be a good policy to pur
sue with reference to the contest be
tween rivals for tho trail in the south
western part of the state.
Consider Bond Issue.
Commissioners Corzine, Robinson
and Bryant, with a number of citizens,
were present at the meeting last night
and expressed their willingness to co
operate with the people of all sections
of the county hi carrying out an
plans that may be undertaken. J. W.
Kayser made the motion that meetings
be held In tho various towns of the
county for the discussions of road
matters, that committees from Chick
asha bo sent to the same, suggesting
that the issuance of bonds for roads
and bridges should be considered.
Mr. Colby explained that road bonds
running 20 years could be issued, pay
able in annual installments. "Under
the existing arrangements not enough
money is available in any one year to
accomplish anything," ho said. "U
fcond were Issued, we could begin to
get the benefits of good roads at once
fcnd the revenues derived from much
aud that is not now taxable would go
toward paying for them in the future."
Jlr. Colby said about 200 mlL-s of
toads would connect the markets in
the county. He will make some plans
fend estimates of the cost to place be
fore the meeting next w eek.
I Bureau Business.
la addition, to receiving reports and
attending to miscellaneous mattern,
the directors of the Commercial and
Farm bureau transacted the mollowlng
business:
Ben Morgan was appointed chairman
of a committee to raise the remainder
ol the college advertising fund.
An Invitation was extended to tho
Confederate veterans of the state to
hold their reunion In Chickasha next
year.
Preeldont Cook appointed tho follow
ing delegates to the National Irriga
tion congress at El Paso next month;

ed their labors for this term yesterday

In the matter of the board releasing
G. W. Hill from tho payment of certain

and the county clerk was instructed to

pear before the board at the next reg
ular meeting of the board.
The matter of auditing the county

The programs and plan of action had

sification was prodigious considering
the accommodations which have been
rendered insufficient by the heavy en
rollment.

ter was taken up informally on several

tain Mrs. Coryell in that position, sup

ment of Mrs. Coryell but were willing
to accept that of any other woman ap
pointed by the commissioners and wlu
shall be approved by the state offi

work bo not abandoned.
