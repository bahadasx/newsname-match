Averting the threatened railway
strike which would have tied up
the nation, and the passage of a
I>i 11 in congress giving to railway
workers an' eight-hour day begin
ning next January, are the actions
which have at last united the com
mon people of the nation for
Woodrow Wilson. The dividing
line has been clearly marked be
tween those for and against this
measure —Wall street and the rail
wny owners and the republican
minority in congress on the one
side—and the working men, the
eight-hour day, the rights of the
shipping public and the Wilson
administration on the other.
The old guard of the republican
party in congress voted against
the eight-hour day. 26 of them in
the senate, headed by such men as
Smoot. Penrose, Oliver, Weeks,
Dupont and Jones, who have ever
been on the side of capital regard
less of the pleas of labor. The
democrats, 42 of them, stood with
the workingman and brought the
eight-hour day to the railway
workers. Senator Lafollette, the
Wisconsin progressive, voted with
the democrats,
President Wilson now hffs the
Wall street and railway financial
interests directly arrayed "against
him. with plenty of money at their
disposal in an attempt to defeat
him for reelection. They feel that
he is their enemy and that he can
not be managed by them. The
■workingmen of the nation on the
other hand now realize that their
president has knowingly arrayed
the Wall street interests against
him by taking a stand for the
working man. The result will be
money on one side, but the united
votes of the common people on the
other, for the progressive legisla
tion of the past years is not for
gotten, and no panic can be sprung,
by eastern banks to frighten the
workers again.
Some of the eastern states which
have been considered doubtful are
now marked as certain for Wilson,
especially in those states where the
factory employes constitute a large
part of the vote.
Some republican papers have
intimated that Wilson's stand for
the workers was simply a political
move to gain votes. No doubt it
gained votes —but would Hughea
have done it? Would Taft haw
done it ? Would Penrose or Smoot
or Weeks have done it, even for
votes? Answer that question,
and you have shown the reason for
Wall street's opposition to Wilson,
nnd for Wall street's support of
Hughes.
William Jennings Bryan, Sena
tor Ollie James and Francis J.
Ileney, the San Francisco graft
prosecutor and former progres
sive, have been added to the list of
probable speakers who will ap
pear in Washington in behalf of
President Woodrow Wilson in the
coming campaign, according to
Hugh Wallace, national committee
man.
In addition to these spellbinders,
Mr. Wallace has told the Wash
ington state organization there is
reasonable assurance given by the
national committee that Martin J.
Glynn, former governor of New
York and the man who delivered
the keynote speech at the St. Louis
democratic convention, and Sena
tor James Hamilton Lewis, former
congressman from Washington,
will tak,e the stump in this section
for the president. These two have
previously been mentioned.
-John B. Fogarty, democratic
state chairman, is also booking
Otto A. Case, one of the progres
sive candidates for governor, with
Robert Bridges, democratic sena
torial candidate, for speeches in
western Washington.
The lack of results following the
trip of Hughes through this stHte,
and the straw hallots which indi
cate an upheaval of the vote and
;i turning toward Wilson and his
policy of peace, have indicated to
the democrat! that Washington
may %>> for Wilson, and no effort
will be lacking to carry the Wil
siiii policies to the people. The
certainty <>f this state's vote in
the past hus directed the attention
of the country*! big men to other
states in campaign time, but this
year Washington is favored by re
publicans and democrats, in view
of an alarming condition in the
ranks of the supposedly staked
and-tied republican vote.
The break of the progressives
and their stand for Wilson has
Iteen the large contributing cause,
and it is barely possible that Aber
deen will go down into history as
the reason for the death of the old
party machine in Washington.
What ails the republican nation
al committee? Is it down with
the "sleeping sickness," or is it
under the delusion that Hughes
is already elected and no great
effort will be neded to prevent
progressives drifting over to Wil
son in large numbers? Up to date
the national committee has been
asleep at the switch. Mr. Hughes
is making a hard campaign, and
Mr. Koosevelt is giving him gal
lant support, but there is no evi
dence anywhere that the national
committee is awake and stirring.
If the committee leaders think they
have a down-hill pull and a ma
cadamized highway ahead of
them, and shall persist in that be
lief, they will find themselves in
for a jolting awakening in Novem
ber. —Spokesman-Review.
Candidate Hughes' chief com
plaint against the democratic
party is that President Wilson has
accomplished in three and one
half years what the republican ad
ministration failed to do in the
preceding 20 years. The next
complaint is that the administra
tion did not send the young men
of this country into Mexico to pro
tect the steel and oil interests of
the east. The third complaint is
that Wilson did not threaten war
when Germany invaded Belgium
and when Germany sank the Lusi
tania. With these things off his
mind, he finds the democratic
party guilty of only a few minor
defects, suejh as general incom
petence, mismanagement and
wastefulness. All of which Mr.
Hughes just happened to notice
since he received his nomination
from the Karnes-Penrose-Smoot-
Wall street people, previous to
that time finding no fault with the
way his job was paying him or
with the work being done by oth
ers at the national capital.
The head waiter of the hotel
came over and genially inquired of
the guest: "And how did you find
your steak, sir?" "Why," re
sponded the man, "I just rolled
over the potatoes —and there it
was."
Abner was haled into court to
answer a complaint that grew out
of a broken bargain, and among
witnesses called was Hiram Haw
kins.
"Mr. Hawkins," said the exam
ining lawyer, "you know the de
fendant in this case, do you not?"
''Oh, yes," answered Hiram.
"Knowed him nigh onto forty
years."
"What is his reputation for
veracity?" asked the lawyer. "Is
he regarded as a man who never
tells the truth?"
"Wall. 1 can't say that he don't
never tell the truth," answered
Hiram, "but I do know that if he
wanted his hogs ter come to din
ner he'd have ter git somebody
else tei*call 'em."
Only three times in eighty yearn
has the ueetttlfy of the treasury
received a surplus from the post
master general. These three times
have been the three years ended
during President Wilson's admin
istration. Postmaster General
Burleson has jnst handed Seere-
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
tary McAdoo a check for $."j,20U,
--000, representing the postal pro
fits of the fiscal year 1916. In
every year of republican adminis
tration of the postoftice depart
ment there has been a deficit, run
ning as high as $17,000,000. This
might be used as a further proof
of Candidate Hughes' contention
that democrats are incompetent to
run the business of the nation.
The republican party next week
wilh select its candidate for
United States senator. Poindex
ter has opposition on all sides, yet
is considered the strongest candi
date at this time. Eastern in
terests have flooded the state with
letters against Poindexter and
commending Humphrey. Bryan
is playing for second choice votes
from both men.
Whatever we may think of Poin
dexter's insatiable desire for of
fice, on any old ticket which hap
pens to be popular, we can com
plain but little of his stand in con
gress, lie has been consistently
ou the side of the popular rights
in voting with the democrats.
Humphrey has been consistently
on the side of the interests, and is
ranked as one of the rankest stand
patters in the country.
The republicans will next Tues
day show to the world whether
they have left any vestige of pro
gressivism. If Humphrey is
nominated as a running mate for
Jones in the senate, the attitude of
republicans of this state will be
sufficient notice to the world thai
they are beyond aid.
While we never make rash state
ment*, we do feel justified in an
nouncing that are certain
signs which seem to indicate that
the backbone of winter has been
broken.
Atty. L. B. Donley of Colville
is running for prosecuting .attor
ney on the democratic ticket.
l,evi is ti former Marcus boy. who
has been making good in his pro
fession. We believe he would not
only make a good prosecutor, but
would conduct the office for the
people irrespective of party lines.
He is opposing Howard Stull on
the republican ticket, there being
no contest in the primaries.—Mar
ens Messenger.
The democratic national com
mittee has appointed the following
on the auxiliary finance commit
tee for Colville: A. E. Dodson, J. C.
Harrigan, P. H. Graham, F. Y.
Wilson, P, L. Stonehouse, I, J.
Lusswell, T. N. Ledgerwood, C. M.
Durland.
The first of the three candidates
for judicial honors to make his
announcement public was J. A.
Roobford. who more than three
months ago made his statement to
the public through the newspapers.
Mr. Kochford has lived and prac
ticed in Stevens and Pend Oreille
counties for nearly twenty years.
During that time he has had to
rely on his own ability in compe
tition with the legal talent of
Stevens, Pend Oreille and Spokane
counties for the success which he
has achieved. Mr. Rochford's
legal qualifications are of a high
order and his moral standing un
questioned. He is the man of
whom Senator W. L. Jones, (then
congressman) said in an open
letter. "I have known J. A. Roch-
I'ord for about ten years personal
ly and intimately and know him
to be a most worthy gentleman.
He is a man of honesty and integ
rity. His private character is
Hbove reproach." It is now up
to the |>e()ple to say by their votes
whether they believe such a man
entitled to the honor for which
he is asking.
W. J. Jackson is a democratic
candidate for sheriff of Stevens
county, subject to the primaries.
Mr. .Jackson served aa sheriff in
Colorado before moving to Stevena
county. Two yeara ago he was
