Synopilg of the Play
Tho Prlnco and the Pauper, is one
of tho most delightful and thorough
ly enjoynblo of Mark Twain's many
works. It Is a film that will bo ap
preciated by young folks of all uses,
for in its merriment and clover hum
or, with its dashes of dramatic
thrills that frequently sweep the
spectator off his feet, as it were, only
to replace film with a laugh, tho story
comblnos all tho elements of a great
artistic triumph such as can bo con
ceived only by tho mind of a master,
and adequately Interpreted only by a
star of the unusual ability of Miss
Clark.
The photoplay catches with' uner
ring fidelity the spirit of tho great
author, transferring to tho screen tho
indefinable wealth of rich humor
which has made the story a house
hold treasuro, beloved by everyone
to whom It is familiar.
Marguerite Clark, who is featured
I In tho dual rolo of the Prince and tho
Pauper, reaches the artistic climax of
her career in her marvelous Interpre
tations of these, distinctly different,
yet closely a'ssoclatdd characters. Her
oxqulsito artistry was never displayed
-, to better advantage than in her splr-f-
ited enacting of the charming prince
and her sympathetic portrayal of tho
pathetic Httlo boggar.
f Tho film has given unlimited oppor
) tunlty for tho display of directorial
' skill in the uso of tho double expos-
I uro in thoso scenes which show both
of tho youthful characters on tho
i screen at tho same time. Marvelous
I illusions have been created by" tho
art of tho camera which far surpass-
l, cs In realism and interest the llmtta-
tlons of tho stage that forced, tho uso
'i In tho theater of a plot which permit-
f ted tho appearanco of only ono of tho
) characters on tho stage a' ono time.
' Photography has rendered possible
l strict adherenco to the original of the
j charming tale, and in tho futuro it
! will be to the .motion plcturo that tho
I public will turn for tho greatest en
joyment of the story which It has
learned so to love and,'revero..
This production .will.Mshowa at
the Lyric Theater on, Monday and

OPENING OF -SOUTH
CACHE
HIGH SCHOOL
Ifeyer. In thV"v history of tho high
schools of Cache county has such a
favorable opportunity faced tnom as
now faces the South Cacho School.
With a most modem building, a fac
ulty prepared particularly for tho
work they aro going to teach, and a
probable enrollment of live, energet
ic students far greater than any oth
er year, tho South Cacho High School
looks forward to Its moat successful
year.
The new building will nol bo com
pleted for the opening of school but
In less than a month the doors of
the new school will bo opened to tho
students.
On September is, tho school will
open In tho buildings of last year
which havo been thoroughly cleaned
for tho brief period before tho com
pletion of the now building.
The aim of the South Cacho school
Is to fit the boys and tho girls for
the highest possible usefulness and i
happiness In life, to promoto the mor
al and intellectual sldo of every stu-1
dent and :o make tho boys and girls I
self directing and self respecting men
and women. Although the dellnlto
subject of religious training Is not
given In tho school, a boy or girl can
not help getting religious truths thru
the study of tho unity in nature and
other great phenomena. It may then
bo said that tho ulm of the school Is
also to promoto tho religious feeling
in the student.
Tho school lg not In any way a ri
val of any othor school, but on tho
contrary is an institution working
primarily for the advancement and
the education of the young, and while
they solicit tho attendance of every
boy and girl in South Cacho, with
tho necessary standing, they wish
each student to attend that school
best suited to their Individual needs
Amusements will bo provided at
tho school or under school manage
ment to meet tho demand of tho stu
dent nnd If tho student will spend
the necessary time on their school
work no additional amusement will
bo required and It would bo a decid
ed detriment to tho best lntorest of
the student to spend time In seeking
additional pleasuro. However in face
of thoso facts, If students do attend
the public dances all will bo done
and Is being done by the danco hall
management, to promote clean, ro
spcctablo dancing and to prohibit any
Influence that would havo a detrimen
tal effect upon the young.
Tho school will offer a complote
four years ulgu. school course, , with
special emphasis placed on Industri
al education. Physical1 education
will bo required of all girls and ath
letics offered to tho boys. Voice
culture and music' will havo a prom
lnont placo In the school.
Tho management of tho school In
vites suggestions ad correspondence
from all thoso Interested.

n
Mr. Ephrnlm llergeson, who has
served Cache County as commission
er for the past two years Is a candl
dato for rpiiomlnatlon on tho Demo
cratic ticket at the convention to
day. Mr. Bergeson believes his
work "has been such as a public of
ficial that ho should bo given n sec
ond term by his party. Ho has de
votod his time to tho Improvement
of tho public roads of tho county and
tho work which has been dono dur
ing his administration has been such
that his Mends feel that his party
cannot afford to set him aside for
another candldato at this tlmo.
Mr. Bergeson Is a property holder
nnd taxpayor of tho county and as
to whether or not his work has been
satisfactory as a public official, ho Is
willing that his party should sot in
Judgmont today, and ho shall accept
tho verdict of tho convention. Adv.

DEMOCRATS TO ,
HAVE 'HOT TIME"
IN CONVENTION
Tho Democrats of the county aro
working n pretty smooth game to
ellmlnato John H. Barker from tho
race as sheriff and T. II. Humphreys
from tho raco as county surveyor.
Both theso county officials havo had
two terms each In theso respcctlvo
positions. Other party workers who
feel that thoy too have been faithful
for tho cause of Democracy locally,
want a chance at the "plo counter"
and so intend at the county conven
tion today to get through a resolu
tion to the effect that tho party is
opposed to a third term for any of
fice Tho contention Is that It the
holding of tho ofllco Is a paying prop
osition others would Uko to have u
chanco at It. If tho resolution passes
Barker and Humphreys will bo elim
inated, Tho friends of Ephralm Bergpsen,
county commissioner, who has had
but ono term, is wondering If tho
party In convention assembled, will
Include in the resolution a clause
sanctioning two torms In olflco.
Thero Is a big following In tho Cacho
democracy that wants to support
Hon, Gcorgo Y. Smith for commis
sioner from tho north ond of tho val
ley. It will bo lntoroRtlng to watch
this scrap.
