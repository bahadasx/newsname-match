STREWN WITH DEAD
Many Soldiers Were Stripped of
Clothing by Terrific
Concussion.
LONDON. Sept. 8. Describing the
effects of the Rritlsh bombardment of
the Oerman positions at Or.'.llemont
the correspondent of Reuter'a Tele
Kiam company at British headquar
ters In France says:
"The ground east of th9 village was
sttewn with the German dead. The
corpses In many cases were stark
naked, every stitch of clothing having-
iten oiasiea oir mem. a very large
pri portion of these bodleo showed no
signs of wounds and there Is little
doubt that the men were killed by the
Intense bombardment concussion.
ICven In the dugouts few men escaped
tho bombardment and thoso who did
had their nerves destroyed by the ter
rific pounding of the British guns."
The correspondent considers It sig
nificant that the ground won was not
bombarded by German field guns,
which Indicates, he says, that the
Teutons withdrew their field artillery
out of range.

HOLD BIG MEETING
Meeting at Y. M. C. A. Is
Enlivened With Discus
sion of Matters.
IMPORTANT SUBJECTS
Plans Are Laid for Feature
Event of Year, Tulsa's
Fashion Week.
The directors of the Retail Mer
chants SHSoclatlon held their regular
weekly luncheon in tho private dining
room of tho Y. .M. C. A. yesterday
evening at 6:30 o'clock and took ac
tion on iiiiiio mutters of great Impor
tance. Tho old qurstlon concerning
Itinerant merchants and peddlers was
dlscussod and again postponed for
definite settlement of the various
measures. The occupation tax. as
proposed by tho city commissioners,
was referred to a committee. A new
director was elected and tho dale for
the rail fashion show was definitely
set.
t". T. Hiinigarner, president of the
association, presided at tho business
meeting ami brought before Ihe di
rectors the draft of the proposed or
dinance as dratted by City Attorney
John It. Meserve, which when put Into
effect Is Intended to prohibit ped
dling In competition to tile regular
merchants of the city.
Would Set I.l-nsc High.
The proposed ordinance makes It
necessary for the Itinerants to declaro
the value of their wares. It Is In
tended they shall then be taxed $10
a day for every $1,000 valuation or
fraction thereof. The penalty for tho
violation of the proposed ordinance
was set ut $100 for every day on
which tho violation Is proven to have
occurred.
An Itinerant or peddler was classi
fied In the measure as a parson who
has not been In the city and doing
business for a period of 120 days.
The measure, If passed by the com
missioners, will be of untold value,
say the merchants of the city, who
have had to bear the brunt of tho
taxation of the city, as It will stop
the competition between the peddlers
and the larger cities.
The ordinance, if adopted, will not
attempt the stopping of those people
who take orders and make later de
liveries through their main firms, as
they are protected In their business
by an act nf the Interstate commerce
commission.
Against Clly Ordinance.
The proposed tax which the city
commissioners have contemplated
levying on the merchants of the olty,
amounting to $1 a month, was
brought up end referred to a com
mittee. Most of the discussion was
unfavorable to the adoption of the
measure. The commissioners have
signified their Intention of stopping
all peddlers and hucksters If the mer
chants of the city are willing to ac
cept tho proposed tax.
Ily an nmendmont to the bv-law,
the directors voted to elect nnother
director at their next meeting. He
will be a representative from the res
taurant and enfo business of the city.
Tho total number of the directors will
then be 23.
Set Diilo for Parade,
Tt was decided by the directors to
have the full fashion week during the
week of the Tulsa grand opera sea
son. The opening night will be Wed
nesday, October 28. The Industrial
parade was set for October 81.
At the close or the fashion week
prizes will be awarded for the best
looking window In each one of the
mnnv retail business lines. The prizes.
23 In cash, will be given to the prize
window trimmer.
The Judge will bo selected from tho
members of the national Hssoflatbm

lit will be brought to Tulsa at the
ex ense of the retailers for the ex
press purpose of deciding the ques
tion concerning the most attractive
window display.
Many to F.ntcr Fair.
The question of the Tulsn county
fiee fair was brought up and many
of the directors signified their lnten
tlon of entering exhibits.
The date for the fall display of
goods was not set by the directors.
Some of the men thought that the
di te f f the grand opera was too late
for the annual fall display, and It was
decided to have a fall opening earlier,
but the annual fashion show was deft
nltely set for tho week of the grand
opera.
During this week, a larse exhibi
tion of the latest models of clothing;
will be displayed upon living models
