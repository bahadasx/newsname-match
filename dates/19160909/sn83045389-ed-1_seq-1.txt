The subject next in importance which
Congress will consider will be con
servation of national resources. Water
power hills which failed at this session
will be revived, as will measures for
the conservation of mineral resources
and for control of destructive flood
waters. First on the December pro
gram, however, will be the immigration
bill, with its literacy test, passed by
the House, hut not in the Senate, at
this session, and 111?"* corrupt-practices
bill to reform election methods, which
Senator Owen sought vainly to get onto
the statute books before adjournment.
Representative Kitchin. majority
leader of the House and chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee, who
was not always in accord with the
administration on the national-defense
legislation, said before leaving the
Capitol to-day:
"We have put through more construc
tive legislation than any other session
of Congress. It has been accomplished
I with good feeling all around. There
has been less bitterness and less filibus
tering in this sessi >n than in any
previous session within my recollection.
On the Democratic side we have had
united action, and the session has been
eventful and epoch-making."
The Republicans, pointing to the ap
propriations and authorizations for the
future, mounting close Jo 000,000,000,
closed their pari of the session, pa
iterating t?har.ces of extravagance and
waste.
In closing addresses while awaiting
the arrival of President Wilson refer
ences to the long program of legisla
tive achievement, dominated chiefly by
national defense preparations at a cost
of more than S*?00,ooo,oo(it were made.
Democrats lauded the record of the ses
sion and commended it to the country,
while Republicans sought to criticize,
alleging waste and extravagance, in
spite of appropriations for defense.
Representative CJlllett, of Massa
chusetts, said that "applying the
Democrats' own standard and logic, the
session Just closed far surpassed in ex
travagance any predecessor."
In the closing minutes in the Mouse

President Praises
Work of Congress
Calls Attention to nHelpful''
and Humane Legislation
Passed.
WASHINGTON, September S.?In a
statement issued following the adjourn
ment of Congress, President Wilson
called attention to the "helpful and
humane legislation" passed, aiul de
clared that while he regretted addi
tional legislation dealing with the re
cent dispute between the railroads and
their employees had not been com
pleted, he had every reason to believe
that the question would be taken up
immediately after Congress reassem
bled.
The President's statement follows:
"A very remarkable session of Con
irre?R lias just closed, full, as all recent
sessions of the Congress have been, of
helpful and humane legislation which
constitutes contributions of importance
to the defense, the economic progress
and the wholesome life of the country.
"It Is to be iesrret?Ad that the ses
sion could not continue long enough
to have completed tho program recently
projected with regard to th? accom
modation of labor disputes between the
railways and the employees, but it was
not feasible in the circumstances to
continue the session any longer, and,
therefor*, only the most immediately
pressing parts of the procram could
be completed.
"The rest, it is agreed, has merely
been postpone'd until it can be more
maturely deliberate*! and perfected. I
have every reason to believe that it is
the purnose *of the leaders of the two
houses, immediately upon th* reiiffpm
hliiiK of Congress, to undertake this
additional legislation. It is evident
that the country should be relieved of
the anxiety which must have been
created by recent events with regard
to the future accommodation ?<( such
disputes "

NEW YORK. September v. ? Details
of the firing on the American steam
ship Owego by a German submai'ne in
the English Channel on August 3 were
told by Captain E. W. Barlow, of the

Rotterdam.
Captain Barlow confirmed cable re

! submarine because of a thick haze. He
sa'id that apparently there was no in
j tention on the part of the U boat's
captain to hit the Owego. and added
! that he had no complaint to make.
*It was a clear day, and there was
i a calm sea, but with a thick haze." he
i said, "I could not see the submarine.
' but several shots were tired, and a
? projectile passed the stern of my ship.
1 stopped, and shortly after a sub
marine appeared. We were flying an
American flag, twenty-two feet 'out.
and on both sides of the ship flags ere
painted, together with the name of
the vessel, and the letters 'U. S. A.'
"The submarine commander ordered
me to come to liitn, which I did in a
boat. His first words were:
"'Captain, you should be more care
ful. this is war time!'
"I replied by saying: 'You should be
i more careful. Didn't you see my
flag?'
" 'Rut I signalled you to stop,' the
ofllrer said, to which I replied: 'How

not see your boat'."
"The commander was very pleasant.
He examined my papers, then gave me

"I am satisfied be did not intend to

"It is the practice to communicate to

"The government is perfectly within |
its rights in using any information
which comes to it in these conditions
for any public and national purpose."
This statement, made recently iti re

House of Commons, created a stir there.!
It apparently had been censored out ofi
cable dispatches to the United States.
When asked about the matter to-night. ;
Secretary I.ansitig said It had been ]

make any comment nt this time. It :
is understood, however, that the ile-I

officials here already were vexed at
I2ngland's long delay in answering the I
American protest of May and it i
is probable that an inquiry into the
new development will express that
feeling.
A brief preliminary note was re
ceived July 2 ft. but it was inconclusive.
It is pointed out that the War Min
ister's attitude appears to he in fiat
contradiction to that expressed by
Lord Robert Cecil, Minister of Trade,
and reiterated emphatically in his
statement of August 2.1, saying:
"It cannot be emphasized too
strongly that the general and statisti
cal information extracted from trade
letters, which has proved so invaluable
to His Majesty's government in check
ing the supply of material sent
through neutral to enemy countries
and suppressing the export of enemy
goods, is used for those purposes
solely, and never for the purpose of
substituting allied trade for neutral."
Lloyd George's statement arose, not
in connection with enemy trade or im
ports to neutral countries, but entirely
in regard to an attempt to build up
a protective tariff wall from a neutral
country Some days before. Andrew

?.v.endations to all bakers of the United!
States that the 5-cent loaf of bread be;
.Ijj.. mitinued and the 10-cent loaf stand- ,
ardiv.ert were made after considerable |
discussion at the executive session of
the National Association of Master
Rakers to-day.
They urged that the resolution be put
into effect immediately.
i:, onontic waste incident to the manu
facture of the ."-cent loaf was empha
sized as a reason for its discontinu
ance. Saving in manufacture, im
provement in quality and standardiza
tion are urged in favor of the 10-cent
loaf.
It is also recommended that where
local conditions make it necessary the
smaller loaf may be maintained, with
a j > i' i ?*** consistent with the cost of
manufacture.
The bakers cited the following per
centages of increase in cost of in-|
p red ten t s in the manufacture of bread (

WITH GEIlMAX DE.U)
i LONDON, September S.?Describing:
I the effects of the British bombardment
i of the Gorman positions at Gulllemont,
j the neuter's correspondent at British
headquarters In France says:
I "The ground east of the village ?was
j strewn with German dead. The
j corpses in many cases were- stark
I naked, every stitch of clothing having
; been blasted off them A very large
proportion of these bodies showed no
j signs of wounds, and there is little
'doubt that the men were killed by the
) intense concussion Even in the dug
j outs, with which the place was war
rened, few men estaped the bombard
ment. and those who did said their
nerves were destroyed by the terrific
poundings of the British yuns." *
The correspondent considers it sig
nificant that the ground won was not
bombarded by German field guns, which
indicates, he says, that the Teutons
withdrew their field artillery out of
' range.
Whether this is from apprehension
that the guns might fall into British
| hands or whether it is preliminary to
a general withdrawal, the writer adds,
I can, of course, be only a matter of
! speculation.
