cold, rain or bright sunshine, bravely
surmounting the adverse waves and
the many obstacles which have from
time to time been unsuccessfully cast
before it, like the ever flowing river,
has continued to run on and on.
What we started out to say was sim
ply this, that for the first six months
after starting the paper in this city,
in order to keep down our then small
printing bills and other expensed so as
to enable us to promptly meet all of
our obligations, each Friday evening,
after the papers came from the press,
they would be tied up in a large bundle
and we would lug them to the street
car, on to our humble little home. In
the meantime our good wife, Mrs. Tay
lor, would address the few wrappers
for its regular readers during the week
and after arriving home with the papers
she would make some paste out of flour
and water, then, after eating a little
dinner, we would pitch in and fold the
papers for our dear life, while Mrs.

CHAPTEB 1.
August 31, 1S95, or a fraction more
than twenty-ono years ago Tho Broad
Ax first made its appearance in Salt
Lake City, Utah, and its publication
was continued in that far away west
ern city once each week until June 1,
1S99. Then it was discontinued there
and wo removed back to this great
metropolis where we had resided for
seven years prior to 1S93 and began its
publication in this city July 15, 1S99,
i and it has made its appearance once
each week without missing one single
issue from that timo to tho present,
which is seventeen long years.
It has the groat honor or distinction
of being the only newspaper conducted
by an Afro-American in this hustling
city that has run continuously for sev
enteen long years without missing one
single issue, under the same ownership
or management and we naturally feel
proud of its record and grand achieve
ment in that respect.
Xo one was requested to render any
support to it when it was first started
in this city until after it had been
running for ono month and for tho first
six months after launching it on the
more than the uncertain and very
Jangerous sea of journalism, at this
point for be it remembered that this
city has been tho graveyard for Col
ored newspapers for more than
twenty-five of them have been brought
to the Tight of day within tho past
seventeen years and tho vast majority
of them only breathed the free air of
real journalism (as it were) for a few
years, months or weeks. Then they
gradually gave up the ghost or ceased
to exist, but during all thoso years or
from July 15, 1S99, down to the present
'time The Broad Ax has, like a well

HON. RICHARD J. BARE.
State Senator of Jolict, Illinois, who has at all times stood by the side of State
Senator Samuel A. Ettclson in his fight against "Jim Crow" legislation
which was intended to strike at the civil and political status of the Colored
people residing in this state. He also assisted Senator Ettelson with his
vote and labor to secure the state appropriation for the construction of tho
Eighth Begiment Armory. Therefore, every Colored voter throughout this
state should on Wednesday, September 13, assist Senator Barr to secure tho
nomination for Attorney General of Illinois.
