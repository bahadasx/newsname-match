AN INTERROGATORY OF
THE CARRIERE CASE
WILL THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY TELL THE PEOPLE OF ST. LAN
DRY HIS INTENTIONS REGARD ING AN EARLY TRIAL OF THE
MURDERER OF SHERIFF SWORDS?-NOT A OU'ES
TION OF POLITICS B UT ONE OF JUSTI(
The Eunice Gall, two weeks ago,
brought up the "case" against He
laire Carriere, murderer of Sheriff
Swords, and asked why the crimi
nal, now lying in the Calcasieu par
ish jail at Lake Charles had not
been indicted and tried; why the
grand jury had not been called,
and a special term of court held to
give the man trial.
The district attorney was very
prompt in "setting down" on the
Gall, quoting a decision of the su
preme court that the grand jury
could not be assembled during va
eation of the court; that if such
were done in Carriere's case much
trouble and expense might result
and in case of conviction the ver
dict be set aside by the supreme
court
In the light of the district attor
ney's quoting the decision of the
higher court no one questions the
uselessness at this time of attempt
ing to indict or try Carriere until
after the court's recess.
But, has the district attorney
ever taken the people into his con
fidence and told them what he in
tended doing in the Carriere
"case?" What he will do in the
event the grand jury returns an
indictment charging murder'
Whether in such event he will im
mediately demand possession of the
prisoner from the Calcasieu au
thorities and, securing him, give
him immediate trial? Or whether
on the other hand, an indictment
having been secured, he will let
the matter rest indefinitely, as ihe
has done in innumerable other
cases?
TALKS WITH SCOR1Wi:.; ITCRUCK
t. its -
"Where," asks the girl, whose
letter is unfolded before me,"'
"shall I make application to get
into motion pictures?" It is the
same question I am being literally
bombarded with every day. And it
is a perplexing question. Some
times the persistent recurrence of
it makes me almost heartsick.
These girls, so. many of them,
and all ambitious to become motion
picture stars!
How I wish they all could!
But they all can't-that is the
sad part of it. Experience and ob
servation tell me that, for every
one of them that really succeeds,
a full hundred or more will fail.
Can you blame me, then, for be
ing reluctant to answer the ques
tion? If the girl is encouraged by
my replies and breaks away from
former ties to find a niche for her
self in pictures, the chances are a
[hundred to one that she is making
a mistake. What, then, should I
tell her? I hardly know, but have
about decided on something on this
fashion:
"My Dear 'Screen Struck' Friend:
"I wish that.I courd be real en
couraging and optimistic for your
picture prospects in this answer to
your letter. Wish it-most of all be
cause I can see that you are' am
bitious and have pluck, and I like
that sor of metal in a- girl. But
I can't be very encouraging. 'I'm
afraid that, in spite of all your am
bition and. pluck, you will find it
very hard to get into pictures.
The blood of MariOn Swords cries
aloud for vengeance-vengeance by
the fair and square arm of the law.
The man whose name was a house
hold word all over .ouisiana now
rests beneath the .od and ºhis
friends in this parisH at least want
to know what is going to be done
about an early inilictment and
prosecution of his urderer.
The Carriere "case may not have
any bearng on politi s but its im
portance requires t t the people
be informed what is oing to' be
done in the premises Other cases
of less impot~aiicef ' e been' ig
orously prosecuted by the district
attorney-fought to a finish, and
no "bones" made about it. Is the
district attorney going to prosecute
this case to a finish, too?
What about the Carriere "case,"
Mr. District Attorney? You are a
candidate for re-election to a sixth
term. If you are re-elected this
"case" may be the most important
which you will ever be called on
to prosecute. Are you going to
prosecute it as vigorously as you
did the McRee case and the Walters
case? Or will you let it go by de
fault as you have done many
others?
This is net a question of a de
cision of the supreme court knock
ing out a verdict because the pris
oner was indicted during recess of
court, but a question of
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
ABOUT IT?
Give the people your answer
they would like to know if Carriere
is going to be brought before the
bar to answer for the murder of
your political enemy.
There are lots and lots of girls be
side you trying it and pitiably few
succeeding.
"But if you want to try it ally
way, the only method is to go some
place where pictures are being
manufactured and file your appli
cation in person. There are too
many girls right on the ground
now, waiting for openings, to make
application by mail of. any ac
count.
"You should place your applica
tion with as many producing com
panies as possible, and probably a
few of them will be able to use you
in extra bits after a time. There
is nothing very startling nor en
t'husing about these extra bits, but
they will give you a chance to get
before the camera. The call. for
your services won't come very fre
quently at first. You won't make
much 'money,-not enough to live
on for quite a while, at least.-and I
maybe never enough. It all de
pends.
"If you give promise of being
among the hundreds of others who
are trying extra bits with you,
you'llget a better chance, and
Lhen, if you continue to be an ex
ception, a still better. This is the
only way to final success, but it is
a hard way and the chances at first
are all against you.
"I want to thank you for send
ing the envelope and stamp for re
ply. Some of the girls are-not so
thoughtful."
COMMUNICATION BY POLICE
JUROR CATLETT
To the People of St. andry Parish:
The proceedings of the recent
session of the Police Jury, when
published, will show that I intro
duced a resolution rescinding the
action of that body, o; July 21st,
1916, whereby a reward of Eight
Hundred and No-100 Dollars was
offered for the arrest of Helaire
Carriere "Dead or Alive;" and
whereby this reward was tendered
to apy officer of-the law, notwith
standing that, under the law, re
wards for the apprehension of
parties charged with crime, are
not- available to officers of the
law.
This resolution was laid on the
table, Beaugh, Sylvester and Cat
lett voting against the motion to
lay onr the-table. On the following
day Mr. Brown introduced a reso
lution authorizing the appointment
of a committee of two to negotiate
a loan of Two Thousand Dollars to
pay the reward offered, and to
cover the expense of caring for the
wounded men assist
ing Sheriff Swords in
the attempt to arrest Carriere.
Mr. Sylvester moved as a substi
tute that the advice of Mr. Dubuis
son be obtained touching the legal
Sity of the proceedins. This substi
tute was lost, Beaugh, Sylvester,
Lanclos and Catlett voting for it.
Mr. Brown's resolution was then
offered, and it prevailed. The com
mittee of two was immediately ap
pointed.
My action in the matter was
based upon what I believed my
duty to you to he, under my oath
of office, as your representative. I
ascribe none but honest motives to
those. who differed with me as to
their duties. My attitude was, and
is, that your money should not be
disbursed illegally. I.believed, and
do yet believe, that the action of
the Police Jury on July 21st, 1916,
is illegal, null, and yoid, and should
be rescinded:
ist. Beacuse it is contrary to
good morals an against public
good to offer a reward for the ar
rest of anyone "Dead or Alive."
2nd. Because, with the 'officers
of the law lies the duty. under
their oath of office, to apprehend
those wanted for crime, and no spe
cial reward is available to them for
the discharge of their sworn du
ties.
"I .. . ..
3rd. Because the law prohibits
the Police Jury from incurring a
debt or any pecuniary liability
without providing in the same or
dinance or resolutidn the means to
pay it.
As my duty appeared to me, 1
acted. If the Police Jury may
spend your money illegally in one
instance, it may do so in another..
Very respectfully,
KEMP T. CATLETT.

PRESIDENT WILSON AVERTS
NATION-WIDE .I R. STRIKE
Congress Promjtly Passes Adam
son Bill Which Calls for 8
Hour Day With 10 Hour Wage
A great calamity confronted the
entire country in the shape of the
prospective strike by the Union
Brotherhood of Engineers, Train
men and Firemen numbering some
four. hundred thousand (400,000).
The President, cooly, calmly and
with that perfect poise that char
acterizes his every public act went
into the situation thoroughly, be
came convinced that the 8 hour de
mand of the men with 10 hour pay
was reasonable and that the mo
ment was not opportune for arbi
tration, when there was no legal
machinery.to make the arbitration
effective. So he invited the heads
of the railroads and the Brbther
hoods to meet him at the White
House and discuss the prcs.s and
cons dispasionately and in a spirit
of mutual concession and patrio
tism; the brotherhoods came across
but the railroad heads were averse
to any proposition that did not
carry the principle of arbitration,
besides which they did not think
that the Congress had any consti
tutional right to fix wages, and in
their opinion an 8 hour day at a
10 hour wage was really a higher
wage point the men were aiming at,
altthoug they were the highest
paid among the-railroad forces out
side of the higher officers of the
various railroad systems.
An embargo has been placed on
perishable freights, millions, of dol
lars of perishable stuff was accu
mulating and rotting on, the trade
marts; the cotton season of tlhe
south had opened; the bane season,
would shortly Jollow, waP4,
the consequent bankruptcyr would
imply; the cities had. only a few
weeks ration -on hand and starva
tion would have stared the masses
in the face; so the President cut
the Gordian knot by layin.i: the
the Gordian knot by laying the
whole matter bef'nre Co r:,res.. ur.
ing immediate. action; calling: for
the establishment of an n hour day
as the legal rate for vwo: and pay
for all crews working in iitecrstate
commerce.
He also urged the passage 'of a
law amending the. federal statu~te
providing for mediation, concilia.
tion and arbitration. Congress re
alizing the urgency, promptly pass
ed the Adamson bill, which called.
for an 8 hour day with 10 hour
wage, but failed to take lip the oth
er importa n t recommendation
doubtless because of their, anxiety
to adjourn and it would have been!
impossible to have given this im
portant matter the .caretful: consid
eration it deserved; but there is
no doubt, when Congress recon
venes the matter will be taken up
by the President and the democ
racy and a law enacted which will
make it impossible for either cor
poration or labor to paralyze the
industry of the country by doing
perfect justice to both. The Presi
dent solemnly warned the railroads
when he said "God help you; for
I can't." The time is.at hand when
the looting of railroads by high
finance must stop, when the gi
gantic salaries of overpaid officers
will be scaled, when the water will
be squeezed out of stock and rates
adjusted by 'impartial tribunals,
that will see to it that a decent in
terest shall be paid on legitimate
-bonds and stockv: the 'iandwriting
is on the wall and the financiers
had better take warning or else the
government will take over the con
trol, of the transportation facilities
of the country; when that happens
neither railroad :presidents nor
brotherhoods will stop the wheels
of commerce. The moment the
Adamson Bill was passed even be
fore the signature of the President
was attached, the brotherhood
heads having entire confidence in
Wilson promptly called off the
strike scheduled for. Sept. 4th; the
embargo,was i mediately lifted
and commerce pursued the ev4'

Ducked Issues
The hard contested and interest
ing judicial campaign of the six
teenth judicial district will ter ni-..
nate Monday, for on Tuesday the
people of the parishes of St. Lan
dry and Evangeline must decide
who shall represent them as Judge
and District Attorney during the
next four years.
If making an appeal direct to tajc
people counts for anything Joha
Lewis and Peyton Sandoz should
certainly be elected. They have"
laid their claims before the peopl~
and are not relying on the trickery
of any set of politicians or court°
house oligarchy to place theni .i;
office.
Candidates Sandoz and Lewis
have kept tife promise made to t.e
voters of this district the opening
day of the campaign. That was on
the 4th day of.ul, at a meeting at
Bayou Chicot. The Judge and Ith
District Attorney then announced'
that they were seeking re-electionr
standing on their official records.
Messrs. Sandoz and Lewis said that
they were going to attack the of-.
ficial records of the present. .i-=
cumblents. This they did. 'They:,
have made charges against their
opponents-- have : substantiated
those charges by proof-and from
