With the French Army at Verdun, t? it. 9. The Ger
mans are now entirely on the defensiv ?i t Verdun.
The great battle begun 201 days ago nas now entered
its third and final stage. The French are steadily win
ning back their lost positions. The battle will gradually
die out like an extinct volcano.
It has now been learned definitely that the Germans
were forced to remove huge quantities of artillery and
men from Verdun to the Somme front three weeks ago to
meet the new Anglo-French offensive.
This had an immediate effect upon the morale of the
remaining men. In February they had been told they
were to capture Verdun. At the end of July they were
told it would be sufficient to simply dominate the situa
tion there. But when they had been reduced in numbers
to merely a defensive garrison after nearly seven months
of fighting, their morale was so shattered that groups of
prisoners have been surrendering some of them going
through Verdun singing the Marseillaise, French officers
declare.
The seventh and last great German massed attack was
made on both banks of the Meuse on July 10. The French
checked this blow immediately and took the offensive.
Ever since that time they have retained the initiative,
capturing in their operations more than 10,000 prisoners,
a score of cannon and a hundred machine guns.
Fighting on the west bank of the Meuse has practically
ceased. Hill 304 and Dead Man's hill are now numbered
among the glories of the past. East of the river the Ger
mans are concentrating for a final desperate struggle to
retain the forts of Vaux and Douaumont. Even on this
sector their resistance has immeasurably weakened. This
fact I was able to ascertain personally Thursday and Fri
day when the German bombardment let loose as a prelude
to an attempt to recapture trenches captured by the
French in the Vuax Chapitre and Chenois woods on
Wednesday. This cannonading was incomparable to the
terrific fire from the German guns that marked the early
fighting around Verdun.

the nllies' infantry attacks have grown
less violent in the last 24 hours.
The German-Bulgarian offensive in
Rumania apparently is slackening un

Bulgarian war office claimed any im
portant gains today.
Prepare to Check Germans
Bucharest, Sept. 9. The Rumanian
general staff has shifted large forces
to the southeastern frontier to check
the German-Bulgarian invasion.
It was semi officially announced to
day that "Important forces" ore now
cooperating with the Russians in the
Dobrud.ja. A further retirement may
be necessary both because the Do
brudja territory is difficult to defend
and because the enemy has massed
great forces on that front. But mili
tary authorities declared their confi
dence today that the enemy will be
unable to throw any large force across
the Danube for an advance on Buchar
rest.
The Rumanians were forced to sur
render Tutrnkan after four days of
heroic resistance. They were outnum
bered four to one. said dispatches from
Oltcnitzn, across the river from Tutra

The bombardment by German guns
was so terrific that the roar of the
battle could be heard distinctly In the
Rumanian capital less than 35 miles
away.
The people of Bucharest received the
news of the fall of Tutrnkan calmly.
The German-Bulgarian victory was re
garded as insignificant in comparison
with the Rumanian successes on the
Hungarian frontier.
The fighting in the Dobrud.ja terri:
tory is now taking on the nature of a
general engagement along a front of
nearly 100 miles. The enemy is push

Active buying orders, both for the

higher prices next week, but in some
quarters there was a .disposition to
look for moderate reactions on any de

Augusta, Maine, Sept. 9 The raucous
voice of the campaign spell binder is
resounding through Maine today. Her
rock ribbed foundations are staggering
underneath the weight of words spilled
durincr the last few weeks, for ou Mon
day Maine exercises her ancient pre
rogative of "pointing the way."
Fortv-eight hours before the battle
of the ballots it appeared from the tone
of voices on both sides that Maine
would be registered partly in tho repub
lican column. Judging from predictions
from both republican and democratic
leaders, sifted down the republicans are
expecting a victory but not a complete
one.
The democrats arc slill claiming ev
erything and the confident tone of the
republican leaders falter just a trifle.
The republican leaders today were
unanimous iu declaring that the pres
ence on the battle ground of Nomiuee
Charles K. Hughes has worked tre
mendously in favor of a republican
vote.
Two weeks ago, republican leaders
here admitted today they" were consid
erably dubious as-to the outcome. In
the interval, a flood of orntory probably
unparalleled in politics has been loosed
on Maine voters. The democrats sent
five cabinet members to preach the gos
pel of Wilsoninn democracy. Tonight

orators. Senator Ollie M. James, winds

Harding. President Samuel Oompers of

Democratic leaders do not discount
the moral effect of Hughes' personal
presence on the ground here.

Imperial Headquarters, Russian

Kl Paso, Texus, Sept. 9. Prepara

be placed ou trial early next week for
the murder of his wife and Major But

The grand jury meets at Alpine Mon
day when indictments will probably be

opens at the same time.
Army officers and other friends of
Major Butler are said to have raised a

possible," he replied. The biggest mis
take a general can make is to underes
timate the enemy. Should such an of
fensive develop, it will be for us to beat
it. This I am most confident the Rus
sian army can do.
"On July 18, the Germans started a
counter offensive on the Lipa. It
failed. Future offensives stand to meet
the same fate.
"I will not say that the Austrian
armies on our front have been crushed.
They are, however, badly demoralized.
The Germans have filled in the gaps
with 20 divisions, thus affecting a
stiffening but the Austrians are still
badly disorganized. From the Turks
not more than two divisions are avail
able for the Russian front, so if the
combined offensive comes, the Germans
must carry the principal burden.
"The Russians have shown what they
are capable of doing when properly
equipped. They are now entering the
third winter of the war stronger than
ever. Their defeats at the start of hos
tilities were due to lack of ammunition.
We hnve the munitions now. The drive
on the southern front which began in
May and is still going on is proof of
this. The Austrians are so badly shat
tered that they will require 400,000 Ger
repulblicnn lenders failters just a trifle.
General AJevieff praised the work
done by the allies on the western
front.
"But what about peace t" I asked on
leaving.
A look of grimness overspread his
face.
"Poace probably is some distance
off," he replied. "Neither Bide has at
tained the object for which it is fight
ing. There can be no thought of peace
now. War must follow its inevitable,
historic course."

For their part, tho suffragists were
