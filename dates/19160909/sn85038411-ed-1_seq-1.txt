Chambcr of Commerce Legal
Battle Is Being Watched
With Interest
BECALL BLOUGH GBAXT
Measure Was Passed in Febru
ary, but Never Went to
City Planners
Municipal circles ara watching, and
waiting with more than ordinary in
terest the outcome of the legal battle
that has been negun by the Chamber
of Commerce against the.recent action
of Council in granting a comporation
the right to bridge one of the city's
highways.
The result of the attack against
what is looked upoh as a new policy of
the City Commissioners, is considered
of special significance in view of the
bearing this may have on future pro
gressive development within the city
limits.
Since th eagitation was begun by the
Chamber of Commerce through a
committee of its memhers. lousiness
men and others have learned with sur
prise that Council more than six
months ago set the pace by granting
permission to the Blough Brothers
Manufacturing Company to build, not
one, but two overhead bridges across
Fulton street to connec,t £h.e piain and
annex building.
The Blough Bridge
February 15, 191 ti, City Commission
er W. H. Lynch introduced an ordin
ance permitting Blough Brothers to
bridge Fulton street at a point 90
feet south of Reily street. The meas
ure provided that "Whereas, the
Blough Manufacturing Company find
it necessary for the proper and effi
cient conduct of its business, to con
nect the buildings on either side of
Fulton street, owned by it. by two
bridges, and as apparently no harm
will be done to the city by such con
struction," that the necessary permis
sion be granted.
That measure was never sent to the
City Planning Commission for consid
eration. It was passed and approved
February 22. 1916.
Other stories are now being recalled
in municipal circles of other requests
for similar privilege which were re
fused. No official requests have been
made, or at least none appear on the
records, but it has been pointed out
that informal suggestions by prospec
tive builders were discouraged.
The Effect on the Streets
The possible effect of a general car-
rying out of the overhead bridge policy
W would offset the plan of clearing the
streets and alleys of its network pf
wires and poles, a scheme, by the way,
which is now ueing followed by the
utility companies, is causing a whole
lot of discussion.
"Now," suggested one local business
man, "the councilmen have explained
that they permitted the erection of
the Swift & Company bridge in order
to boost the business district. If this
be true of one section, it is true of
other sections. So what's to prevent
other firms in the commercial sections
of the city from presenting similar re
quests to Council. And the effect of
the plan to clear the streets and alleys
of wires and poles will be lost entire
ly."

New York,, Sept, .9. —Union labor
leaders of national and State promi
nence were called into New York's
transit situation to-day with the an
nouncement by local strike organizers
that within 24 hours a conference
would be held here, the outcome of
which might be a 24-hour tieup of all j
the city's industries employing men af- ,
filiated with the American Federation i
of Labor.
A telegram was sent to Samuel i
Gompers, president of the latter or- j
ganization, who is on a vacation in
Maine, asking htm to hurry here, and
the Central Federated Union an-!
nounced after an all-night meeting:
that a committee had been empowered !
to call a general sympathetic strike in
all trades if such action was considered
necessary to help the employes of the
Interborough Rapid Transit Company!
and the New York Railways Company ;
to win their fight for annulment of the j
so-called "master and servant" con- !
tracts, binding . the ipen not to ask]
wage increases for two years.
Eighteen Arrests Made
Meanwhile, it was announced on i
behalf of the Interborough that ap- j
plications would be made to the courts j
for injunctions to restrain labor lead-!
ers from interfering with men operat- j
ing the subway, surface and elevated
lines.
Police reports indicated that under- I
ground and elevated service was nor- I
mal to-day and that the situation of
the surface lines affected had consid
erably improved. Union leaders
claimed on the other hand that the
surface roads were badly, affected.
Disorders of a minor character con
tinued throughout the day and there
were eighteen arrests. Policemen
guarded all roads, examining bags and
packages carried by passengers, owing
to persistent reports of plots to dyna
mite transit property.
Refuse Coat for Traction Company
At its meeting last night the Central
Federated Union adopted a resolution
requesting Samuel Gompers, president
of the American Federation of Labor,
to come here and take charge of the I
situation.
John P. Riley, president of the dis
trict council of the International Long
shoremen's Association, said to-dav he
had instructed the 1,800 members of
the Tidewater Boatmen's Union not to
handle barges laden with coal for the
Interborough Rapid Transit Company's
power houses.
The order, Riley claims, which af
fects coal passers, will cripple, if not
entirely stop, the Interborough system,
which includes the subways and ele
vated roads of Manhattan and the
Bronx.

LAFEAN LEADING
FOR VACANCY
York Republican Chieftain
Said to Have Inside Track
For Commissionership
Congressman-at-large Daniel F. La
fean, of York, is the most prominently
mentioned man for the vacancy in the
public service commissionership
caused by the death of Samuel W.
Pennypackor. Mr. Lafean, who was
formerly Republican district congress
man from the Democratic York-
Adams district and elected as con
gressman-at-large in 1814, is a power

Reynolds of Bedford; J. Banks Kurtz,

county, although a Philadelphian by
long residence and associations.
Dr. Brumbaugh is expected here to

a home and a mother."
Miss Borden was immediately dub
bed the "Poor Little Rich Girl."

that county, which would cover the
cost of the machine.
"Will you place this matter before
our home people? A nightly enter
