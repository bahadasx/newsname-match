* IMPERIAL HEADQUARTERS RUSSIAN ARMY,
Sept. 9.—Germany must send 400,000 men to the aid
of the demoralized Austrian* if she hopes to stiffen
their resistance. Gen. Michael Alexieff, chief of start of
Czar Nicholas* armies, told the United Press today.
Furthermore. German troops must provide the
driving power if Von Hindenburg attempts the ?reai
L-astern offensive talked about in Berlin. The Austro-
Germans cannot count upon the Turks for substantial
aid. said the man who directs the movements of Rus
sia's millions of troops.
RESEMBLES BUSINESS MAN
Gen. Alexieff received me in a small, plainly fur

Nicholas. A flat-top desk, a few chairs and maps were
the only furnishings. The general looked like an

white. His eyes are deeply set, small, gray and

"Dear Mr. Walker: In reply to your inqttiry of the

Sen. Poindexter, we have to say: In every instance in which
we have appealed to the senator for assistance, we have
received prompt and courteous attention.

"We have an impression in the office that if prompt ac
tion is required on matters of interest to manufacturers that
the senator could be depended upon for results.'
"We have no evidence that the senator has shown any
particular partiality to one geographical section of one state
over another, altho we were under the impression that he
was especially in favor of the location of a department of

well justified.
