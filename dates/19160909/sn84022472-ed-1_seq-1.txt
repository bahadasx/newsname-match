angry mass of foaming waves in
which no small craft could live.
"As the fury of the marine disturb

to be dragging her anchor and grad

wavej that seemed larger than any
that had preceded it, lifted up the
warship, held her on its summit for
a moment and then dashed her down
on a submerged reef within 200 yards
of dry land. From the after ventila
tors of the ship was pouring clouds of
steam. The waves, some of them
were running as high as the top of
her funnels and the Memphis was
shoved ashore until she was only 50
yards away. An improvised breaches
buoy was put in operation and the
men on the wrecked ship were
brought ashore, some of them terribly

an echo of the voice of Reed Smoot, of
