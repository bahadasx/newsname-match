THOUGHTS ON THE
EUROPEAN WAR
Blame wild, untutored tribes no moro
Who fought nnd bled in days ot yoro
To suit their mastors well;
No siivago lands thnt over fought
Such awful deeds of horror thought
As nro committed still.
Let Europo's rulers blush for slinmo
And vaunt no moro a chlrstlan nnnie
But live to suffer scorn;
Far better they had nover known
Or novor had been born.
A scepter or un earthly throne.
With ovory law of man and God
Defied and trampled lu tho sod,
I Thoy pray for strength to kill
j Thoy seem to reckon God a fool
! Who needs tho military school
To guldo his sovcrlgn will.
That kings hnvo oft been arrant knaves
And slcop dishonors In their graves
Is known by sago nnd clown
But thank tho Lord thnt bettor things
I Await tho world, when trynnt kings
i Are forced to kuucklo down.
