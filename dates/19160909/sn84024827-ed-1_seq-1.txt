and a band of Vililstas south of Kl

WASHINGTON'. Sept. 8. Heavy
damage to the country's cereal crops
during August caused a loss of nnny
millions of bushels of prospective pro
duction, cutting down the outlook for
wheat to below the amount required
for home consumption. The depart
ment of agriculture's monthly fore
cast issued today estimates the wheat
crop nt 611,000,000 bushels, or 9.000,
000 bushels less than is calculated to
be necessary for domestic use. A carry-over
of approximately 160,000.000
bushels of old wheat from last year's
record breaking crop, however, will
nviko up the deficiency and leave
something like 100,000.000 bushels
available to supply the heavy demand
of foroogn nations for American
wheat.
Spring wheat, parched by hot and
drv we-uber showed a loss of 43.000,-
uurin'i! nun f t lit" rtUfsuiL ni uni
! of production. vrho com ostiniRtes
were 67.000.000 bushels smaller than
forecast a month ago.
A preliminary estimate of the win
ter cron places the production at
455.000,000 bushels and that of spring
wheat nt ir.fi.OiTO.000. The prospective
spring cron is the smallest in 22 years
and 200.000,000 bushels less than har
vested last year. The total wheat
cron Is pl iced at 611.000.000 bushels, j
which is 400.000,000 bushels less than
1js vfir's record breaking crop of
1.012.000.000 bushels. The co-iibined
winter and spring wheat crop is the
smallest since 1900 and the acreage
is the lowest in 23 years.
The heavy loss in prospective pro
duction of corn was due to drought.
In Oklahoma many fields of corn were
cut from ensilage or fodder. The to- I
tal crop is forecast at 2.710.000,000
bushels, which is 22 000.000 bushels j
smaller than the average for the last
five years.
Production of 318.000,000 bushels of
potatoes is predicted.
Other losses from the production
estimates made a month ago are:
Oats 4:1.000,000 bushels, barley 11.
OnO.000 bushels, buckwheat 1.300,000

later Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, honor
ary president of the association, with
.Mr. Wilson still present, declared:
"We have waited long enough to
get the vote. We want it now. I
want it to come during your admin

stood and cheered, wair.g handker
chiefs. The President's pledge of support
to the suffrage question caused Mrs.
Chapman Catt. president of the organi
zation, to say in a speech so.;i after
he closed :
"You tout hed our hearts and won
our fealty when Vu said you had
come here to tight with us."
The President did not speak on the
method by which he would bring
ibout woman suffrage, but said, '"we
shall not quarrel in the long rjn as
