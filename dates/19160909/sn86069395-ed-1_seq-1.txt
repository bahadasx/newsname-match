BURKE AS
A KNOCKER
Evidently Dpesn't Feel Kind
ly Toward the Town That
Made Much Over Him.
Rev. Burke Culpepper joined the
Hnghcs Knocking Club at Cadiz and
stung the bosom that warmed him
less than a year ago. Here is the
Rccqrd's account of what ho said
about Col. E. D. Jones, who put on a
silk shirt and a gold watch and went
to hear him preach, but "cut out" his
"men only" sermon:
Friday night to an audience num
bering near 2,000 people, the speaker
got off a good joke on Bro. Jones.
He said. "Bro. Jones wouldn't
come to hear my sermon this after
noon to men only, thinking that I was
going to get off that old sermon that
he heard me preach to that Hopkins
ville bunch. You down here at Ca
diz don't need that sermon. There
is as much difference between Cadiz
and Hopkinsville as. there is between
heaven and hell. If you'd write a
letter and direct it to hell and put a
postage stamp on it, it would go
straight to Hopkinsville."
And yet when Mr. Culpepper left
Cadiz he "came straight to Hopkins
ville." 0. E. 8. ELECTION.

historical spectacle which comes to
the Tabernacle, September 15 and 1G,

president of the Hope-Maury Chapter,
U. D. C, wrote the following letter
to the Norfolk Ledger-Dispatch:
"The Birth of a Nation" is wonder
ful! KuKluxKlan! What they suffer
ed, lost and braved! This was a band
of knights sent to make things work
out as was desired, and none but
these men could have accomplished
it. There is much that makes one's
heart ache; much that brings pleasure
and happiness; tears and sunshine
are well coupled. "The Birth of a
Nation is a revelation and history
carried out."
In Los Angeles the members of the
John II. Reagan chapter adopted this
resolution and forwarded it to Mr.
Griffith through their acting president,-

captured elements of trenches from
the Germans and broueht forward

fresh advances by the entente allies
In addition, great aerial activity was
shown by French and British aerial
