BUCHAREST, Sept. 9. The Rouma
nian general staff has shifted large
forces to the southeastern frontier to
check the German-Bulgarian Inva
sion. It was aeml-offlclally announced to
day that "Important forces" are now
co-operating with the Russians In the
Oobrudja. A further retirement may
be necessary both because the Oo
brudja territory Is difficult to defend
and because the enemy has massed
great forces on that front.
But military .authorities declared
their confidence todav that the enemy
wll be unable to throw any large
force across the Danube for an ad
Tance on Bucharest.
The Roumanians were forced to sur
render Tutrakan after four days of
heroic resistance. They were out
numbered four to one, said dispatches
from Oltenttza, across the river from
Tutrakan.
The bombardment by German guns
waa so terrific that the roar or the
battle could be heard distinctly In
the Roumanian capital, less than thirty-five
miles away.

EVANS SETS PACE
Leading Champion Gardner for
Golf Championship by 3
Up.
MERION CRICKET CLUB. HAVER-
FORD. Pn., Sept. 9.-Chlck Evans, n
tionai open champion, was 3 up on
Robert A. Gardner, the amateur title
holder, at the end of the first round to
day of their 36-hole match for the Ml!
amatuor golf championship.
The cards were as follows:
Evans, out 35466534 J 33
Gardner, out 5 5 4 5 7 4 4 4 5 13
Evans, In 5 3 6 3 6 4 4 3 4 JJ-77
Gardner, In 5 3 5 3 4 6.4 6 640-!
Evans had distinctly the best of the
first round, although the match fvas
squared on the fourth, sixth, and four
teenth hole. Evans twice on the earlier
lj.Mc. kuvu evidence of bis old weakness
In putting, but on the whole was better
than his rival at the cups.
Gardner from the start seemed to be
fatigued, playing with far less snap
than on previous days. He was oft the
course at least half the time, and but for
numerous fine recoveries would have
been far worse off.
For the first time this week, too. the
luck seemed to be rather against Gard
ner. The crowd, which Increased to
about 4.000 persons, bothered both men,
despite the big list of marshals, and
had something to do with Evans not
making a better show on the first half
dozen holes.

Bring Pressure
For Militia Recall
Members of Congress Want Them
Brought Back From Bor.
der and Demobilized.
Strong pressuro Is being brought to
bear by members of Congress to Induce
the War Department to order the na
tional guard back from the border and
to demobilize troops remaining In State
camps. .
Tho anticipated withdrawal of Gen
eral Pershing's army from Mexico,
which will leave the entire mobile army
of the United 8tates available for bor
der duty, will give all the border patrol
necessary, It Is argued, since the border
raid situation has been brought under
control.
According to War Department figures
It Is costing $15,000,000 a month to keep
the national guard on .lio border. It
lias cost $90,000,buo since the Columbus
raid.
Secretary McAdoo obtained an emerg
ency appropriation of 1130.000,000 to
maintain the troops until December.
Members of Congress urging return of
troops Insist the Government Is getting
no benefit from keoplng troops on the
border that Justifies this expenditure.

transportation of pupils who may be liv

one which also, he said, must be given

SYMPATHY STRIKE
S PLANNED IN N.Y.
Federated Union Authorized to
Call Out Workers If Neces
sary to Aid Car Men.
NEW YORK, Sept. . The greatest
fight for the preservation of unionism In
the history of New York was forecast
today when the Central Federated
Union, representing approximately
730,000 men and women of all trades, ap
pointed a committee with power to call
a general sympathetic strike. If such ac
tion should be found necessary to aid
the striking employes of the traction
companies. ... ,
'the action of the federated union was
taken after an all-night session at the
Labor Temple. The traction companies
bitterly were assailed for their open
threat to destroy the Amalgamated As
sociation of Street and Electric Railway
Employes.
Whether the federated union commit
tee will call a general strike Is problem
atical. Union leaders declare they are
prepared to carry their tight for union
ism to the finish. The employers, how
ever, declare the street car strike Is now
entirely broken, and that a spread Is
not to be expected.

AUGUSTA. Me.. Sept. 6. The raucu

Maine today. Her rock-ribbed foun
dations are staggering underneath the
weight of words spilled during tho
last few weeks, for on Monday Malno

there were no unforeseen conditions.

THREAT OF REPRISAL
State Department Officials Ad
mit Visitors Warned Against
Retaliatory Action.
It was admitted at the State Depart
ment today that threats of retaliation
were made by Canadian officials when
the Chamborlaln fisheries amendment
was before Congress.
Sir Joseph Pope, Canadian minister of
external affairs, and W. A. Fround,
Canadian superintendent of fisheries,
warned Secretary of State Lansing that
If retaliatory legislation was passed
affecting Canadian fisheries In the Pa
cific, Canada might adopt reprisals
against American fisheries In the Atlan
tic. It wa said today that the lobby com
mltteo charged with the duty of Inves
tigating the activity of Canadian of
ficials In opposition to the Chamberlain
amendment, will call Secretary Lansing
before them to question him at length
regarding the action of the Canadian
government ornciais.
To Question Lansing.
In their visit to the State Department,
the two Canadians were accompanied by
Colvllle Barclay, counselor of the British
embassy.
The lobby committee also will en
deavor to learn whether the British gov
ernment brought any pressure to bear
on the State Department,
The lobby committee, It Is understood,
desires to question Secretary Lansing
at to lust what pressure was brought to
bear that caused him to oppose the
Chamberlain amendment at the eleventh
hour.
Regardless of the threatened reprisals.
Senator Chamberlain announced today
that he wuold Introduce a 'bill next ses
sion providing for the exclusion of hali
but and salmon coming from regions
In the north Pacific other than Ameri
can ports from entrance Into this
country. Senator Chamberlain will
press this bill and endeavor to procure
its passage.
Holds Action Proper.
This Is the provision which was
knocked out of the revenue bill after
Canadian government officials who are
charged with lobbying here, had made
threats that unless tho provision was
dropped, retaliatory measures would be
taken. Senator Chamberlain Intends to
present the bill as a separate measure
at the outset of the next session.
Secretary Lansing, It Is known, does
not share the view expressed In tho Con-
gresslonal debate that Sir Joseph Pope
was guilty of lobbying in nis enoris 10

Lansing Is understood to hold that It
was entirely proper tor tne uanaaian
minister to bring diplomatic pressure to

Hughes Stil Favorite
In Betting at 10 to 8
NEW YORK, Sept. D. Tho odds
quoted in Wall Street election
betting today were 10 to 8 on
Hughes to beat Wilson. There
is plenty of Wilson money in
the market, but it is being held
off for 1 to 2.
The odds in the State election
betting have shifted from 6 to
5 on Seabury to G to 5 on Whit
man. About a month ago a
bet of 16,000 to $5,000 on Sea
bury to beat Whitman was
made.
Frank Schumm, a Brooklyn elec
tion betting commissioner,
said today that it was too soon
in the campaign for large bets.
Hd thought fair odds at this
time were 7 to 5 on Hughes
against Wilson and 6 to 5 on
Whitman to beat Seabury.
INTANGIBLETAXNOT
EFFECTIVE FOR YEAR
Corporation Counsel Rules That
It Is Not Operative Until
New Tax Year Begins.
The provision In the District appro
priation bill Imposing a tax on Intang
ible property not to lecome effective
until July 1, 1917, according to an opin
ion submitted by Corporation Counsel
Conrad II. Syme to the Commissioners
today. It had been generally believed,
that the law would go Into effect Im
mediately. I'nder the personal tax law of July
1, 19"2, the Irx )ear begins July 1, cor
responding with the fiscal year of the

the owner to the office of the Assessor

the vpecllled time a penalty of 30 ler

the board of personal tax appraisal.
Not Law Till September 1.
"The' District of Columbia appro
pi tatlon act for this ytar, containing
the amendment Imposing a tax upon
certain Intangible property, did not
become a law until September 1,"
says Corporation Counsel Syme.
"Two months of the current tax
year had then elapsed, the time had
expired within which returns of tho
schedules of personal property
should be made, and the penalty for
failure to make return had already
attached. This was known to Con
gress at the time of the enactment
of the amendment, and as no provi
sion was made for separate sched
ules of lntungtble property for the
current year, or for neparate penal
ties, and no provision was made for
prorating the tax for the unexpired
portion of the tax year. It would be
unreasonable to conclude that Con

"The taxation of Intangibles pro

not to the current tax year."

Dealers Already Have Put Up Quo

Washington housewives today are facing the possibility
of an increase in the immediate future of the price of both
milk and bread.
Dairymen of Maryland and Virginia are meeting at the
Hotel Raleigh for the purpose of determining whether they
are to meet the increased cost of producing milk by jacking up
the wholesale price or by a permanent reduction in the quantity
of milk sent to the city.
With the leading dairymen represented at the meeting,
there is every indication that the decision will be of binding
effect on all dealers.
Although not all of the same mind as to the necessity for
higher prices, some bakers in the city admitted today that a
movement is on foot either to increase the price of the pres
ent 5-cent loaf of bread to 6 cents, or of establishing a 10-cent
standard loaf containing less than double the quantity of bread
now represented in the 5-cent loaf.

troduccd Daniel W. Baker, whoex -
plained to the organization tltit tne
old corporation of milk producers had
been obandofied and a new organiza
tion was necessary to comply with the
terms of tho Clayton law.
Mr. Baker tnld that lie did not under
stand Just how far the association
could o In the matter of fixing prices,
a thejega! ospects of the matter ate
not yet.. entirety clear. It appears that
tne ciayton act permus agricultural
Nnd labor 'organizations to U formed,
but does not exempt them from the pen
alties of tho Sherman anti-trust act if
prlco making Is attempted.
Referred to Committee.
The matter was then referred to a
committee, and Frank W. Walker, pres
ident of the Piedmont Dairyman's As
sociation of Virginia was called upon
to glvo some figures as to tho cost of
producing milk. Mr. Walker gave the
cost price at IS cents per gallon the
year round. Views of other members
of the association were sought.
Dairymen of Maryland and Virginia,
who supply most of the milk to the
city, aie convinced that they cannot
supply milk at the present wholesale
prices, and unless they can obtain bet
ter prices, some of them have an
nounced they will be forced to retire
permanently from the dairy business.
The meeting Is regarded as lmnorinnt.
as It brings toguthor the principal dairy
farmers of the territory contiguous to
Washington for the first time and from
the exchange of their views they will
be able. It Is thought, to decide upon
some plan to be submitted to the milk
dealers of tho city.
A raleo In price Is imperative, these
dairy farmers state. If they are to re
main In business. The cost of labor has
Increased during the last year to a much
nigiier ngure man naa been paid before.
It Is the price of feed that is regarded
as most Important, however.
Cost Is Growing.
With wheat at )l.Go pe,r bushel, forc
ing up the price of mill feed, which
forms the 'basis ot the feed given the
dairy herds, the cost of maintaining the
herds Is almost as great as the price
received for the milk.
There are two seta of prices paid for
milk In theu District. One of these, fori
eight months of summer and spring and
fall, averages about 16 cent, per gallon.
(Continued on Second Page.).
AGITATION SPREADING.
The agitation for increased prices
on both of theso food necessities has
been spreading among dealers all over
the country.
The dairymen Insist that the In
creased cost of stock-feed for their
cows make an Increase In the price
of milk imperative.
The bakers are claiming with equal
Insistence that the big Increase In
the price of flour makes It Impossible
to su'iply bread at the present rates.
The situation has become so acute In
New York that the State authorities
have stepped In and offored to act as
middlemen In an effort to save the
people of that city from the threatened
increase In prices.
In Baltimore the dairymen have de
clared for a 2'Cent raise In the price of
milk per gallon, and the bakers have
higher price. Wasnington nousewio
!wlu nnve to begin baking their own
bread, as bakeries would have to close
down If compelled to run under pres
ent conditions, nnd with flour selling
ot Its present price."
In flat contradiction to the statement
of Romlsch. however, Is that of Henrv
Berens, of the Berens Bakery. Sir.
rtirn declnred that there Is no pros
pect of a raise In the price of bread,
and that there Is no plan among tne
l bakerl, t0 rnge the price.
it irt nnt Honv. however, that cer
tain of the baking Interests of the city
had been "feeling out" the bakers as
to their attitude concerning a suggest
ed raise In consonance with that ef
fected by the Baltimore bakers several
days ago.
Individuals May Add to Price.
"Contrary to what any of the baker
ies may Individually decide concerning
a raise In the price." declared Mr. Ber
ens, "there will not be a general raise
by Washington bakers."
By this Mr. Berens explained that
