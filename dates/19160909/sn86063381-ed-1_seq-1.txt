AFRAID OF N. A. TRUSTS
(By United Press)
Buenos Aires, Sept. 9 South Am
ericans are deeply interested in the
suggestion, referred to in dispatches
from Washington and New York, that
the Sherman law ought not to be en
forced against North American busi-
i,^s houses seeking trade on the
southern continent.
South America is exceedingly fear
ful of trusts and especially of North
American trusts The people base
their ideas on translations they have
read from newspapers in the United
States. They believe, literally, the
very strongest things they have read
concrning the trust evil.
This apprehension of trusts, in
fact, is a considerable obstacle in th
way of America's trade progress her

States.
COUNTRY IS IN NEED OF
EXECUTION OF LAWS
Democratic Camnaign Gives Lit
tle Space to the Present
Administration.
Washington, Sept. 9.The Demo
cratic party was flayed in the house
by Representative Halvor Steenerson
for having failed to redeem its im
portant promises. Mr. Steenerson
pointed out that while the Democrats
were boasting of laws they have pass
ed, they had little to say about the
administration.
"Political issues are divided into
two classes." Mr. Steenerson said.
"Those which relate to the adminis
tration of law or policy and those
which relate to legislation or forma
tion of policy.
Little Space.
"The Democratic campaign speech
es devote much space to legislation
and very little to administration.
"President Wilson seems to be the
apostle of the quantitive theory of
legislation He says the Democratic
party has fulfilled all its promises and
points out what it has done, nine
tenths of which consists in enumera
tion of new enactments. He over
looks the fact that the chief prom
ises which the party made were to
reduce the cost of living and to prac
tice economy on public affairs, and
that both of these promises have been
broken.
"What the people want is deeds and
results."
Scores Onslaughts.
Mr Steenerson severely scored the
Democrats for their onslaughts on the
civil service, especially in the postal
service. Continuing his criticism, he
said:
"The trouble with the president
and his supporters is that they have
misconceived the functions of the
presidency. Instead of showing that
he is a great executive and adminis
trator, they are trying to prove he is
the greatest law giver since the time
of Moses. What the country needs
is efficiency in the administration and
execution of the laws."
