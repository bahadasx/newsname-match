REPUBLICANS I
Sure to Carry Marion County,
Prichard and Pople Report
to State Headquarters.
Marion county is coming into the j
Republican column this year with a
big majority for both national and i
state tickets, according to informa- j
tion brought to state headquarters j
here Friday afternoon by E. P. Pople ,
and J. Guy Prichard, both of Fair
mont.
Mr. Prichard, who is clerk of the I
house of delegates, reported that j
many Democrats in the county agreed I
with the Clarksburg Exponent, the lo-j
cal Democratic mouthpiece, in con
demning President Wilson's Mexican j
policy. The Exponent, in its issue of i
Thursday, September 7, had this to j
say in regard to the president's vac
illating Mexican policy: "But there
is nothing to be said in favor or wob- !
bling between the two policies, and j
neither recognizing Huerta nor ac
cepting the responsibility for the
chaos caused by failure to recognize j
him."
Mr. Pople said that besides being \
disgusted with the president's foreign I
policies, a great majority of the Mar
ion county voters are demanding a re-1
turn to the protective tariff, for which }
Mr. Hughes stands.
SlUJRlD
Takes Time by the Forelock and
Get in before the Rank

ard L. Robinson permanent general
vice president, and Leo P. Caulfleld
permanent treasurer. Although the I
meeting is described by the official j
organ of Democracy as "preliminary"
the idea of permanency prevailed,
I lest there be a larger assemblage
jthe next time, in which event, those
who essay to direct the destinies of
Harrison county Democracy, would
I And themselves outvoted and defeat-!
ed in their manipulations.
! Recognizing the party indifference
that prevails, it was deemed expedient
? to hand out a little honor sap and so
[a long list of vice presidents of the
club were appointed representing the
I seven districts, reported as represent
ed at the meeting.
Dr. J. W. Johnston called the
meeting to order and E. G. Smith
I presided.
