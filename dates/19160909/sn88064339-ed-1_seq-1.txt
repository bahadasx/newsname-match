MUARY TRAMING
(The Spokane SpokesmamnReview I
The threefold strength of the Sawls
system of obligatory military training
is that it provides adequate defense,
that it increases the Individual's eMle.
tency beyond its cost, and that it does
not cultivate a mllltaristic spirit in the
nation.
To give it further light on the system
the Scuate committee on military af
fairse alled as a witness Dr Theodore

good it is acknowledged; if he do-e' nt

"Don this system interfere muach
with industrial life Injuriously?" asked
('hairmnan Chambertain; "that is, does
it take men out of the business and
industrial life and interfere with
business."
"No, senator, it does not. The fact
that the original training service of
6? days is In one year-that In, the
20th year and that thereafter the man
has for about seven years only It days,
teesens what might be an Interference."
"it takes him out of Induetrial life,
really, at a time before he beginsl"
"Yes: before, he begins; that Is. he

the man Is an employ., many employ.

There is really no hardship, and it
