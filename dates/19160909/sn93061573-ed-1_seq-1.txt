iitate Of Now Mexico, in convention
assembled, at Santa Fe, tliis 30tti
day of August, 1'JIG, hereby reaffirm
our allegiance to the principles r.f
Democracy as practiced by our na
tional Democratic administration,
and as declared in the Democratic
platform adopted n convention at St..
Louis on June 15, tOlti.
We heartily endorse the national
Democratic administration in its en
actment of the greatest banking and
curreury law the country has ever
had'and particularly in view of the
complete failure of tlu Republican
party in its behalf ; .tí the reforma
tion of the tariff after the Republi
can party had revised it upward in
stead of downward, as the people oi'
the country had commissioned thai
party to do: in the creation of a
trade commission after the Rcpuhli.
can parly had neglected this duty
all its years; in doubling the size
of the United States army and mak
ing provisions for general military
training; in forming the greatest
naval bill in the history of the coun
try; in taking the tariff completely
out of partisan politics by providing
for a non-partisan tariff commission
inenacting the shipping bill which
will rehabilitate the American mer
chant marine; in passing the good
"roads bill which wll make available
to New Mexico for good roads over
a million and a half dollars; in a
mending the enlarged homestead act
so as to make its provisions avail
able to a vast number of our wbTtliy
homesteaders who were unable to
obtain contiguous lands as required
by the old bw, and we point with
..pride tu -!,!)? immediate benefit that
I... . ........I I.. ti.. .....i..!.. f.f rv..n
Htl.T U' lllt-ii IV .tin in win
state through the enactment of this
law, as is evidenced by the thous
ands of tilings already made by our
people in less than two mouths'
operation of the law; that in i'niU't
ing the rural credits bill, 'under the
provisions of whitMi the farmers of
this country will be enabled to ob
tain credit on low rate of interest
and very long time; in keeping the
United States out o the terrible war
that is devastating a large portion
of Europe, and in keeping our own
nation at peace with honor; in doing
more for the country in three years
than the Republican party did in
sixteen years of continuous power.
The Democratic party is unwilling
to abrogate the fundamental prin
ciple upon which our government is
founded as declared in the Declara
tion of Independence, to-wit: That
all Repulbicau forms of government
derive their just powers from the
consent of the governed, and we de
nounce the declaration in the Repub
lieau platform in regard to Mexico,
which can and does mean nothing
less than intervention and the es
tablishment by force in that coun
try of a government of our own
making, thus involving our country
in a war of conquest of the Mexican
people, the sacrifice of the lives of
thousands of Americans and Mexi
can citizens, the destruction of an
enormous amount of property, .the
expenditure of immense sums of
money, and the alienation of the re
spect and coulldence of the citizens
of every Latin-American republic
and we therefore denounce as un
patriotic and as an attempt to trans
form this government into a tyranny
which will impose upon the people ot
Mexico a government they do not
wish.
We are fully confident that upon
the establishment in Mexico, full re
paration is so far us is possible, for
the loss of American lives and full
compensation for the loss of proper
ty of American citizens will be ob
tained through the peaceful process
of diploinacy and in accordance with
the existing treaty obligations be
tween yho two oountries.
We cordially and heartily endorse
the honest, economical and patriotic
administration of our governor, the
Honorable William G. McDonald, and j
all other Democratic state officials.
We point with pride to the marked
improvement in the educational in
stitutions of the state, and especally
to the great advancement made in the
public schools under the present ad
ministration. We highly commend the present
system of road construction under
which many hundreds of miles of
good roads have been built during
the present administration.
We point with especial pride to
the honest and efficient management
of the state penitentiary.
We condemn the action of the last
Republican legislature in unlawfully
unseating four duly elected repre
sentatives of the people.
We condemn no appropriation for
the maintenance of the mounted po
lice and the state militia.
We condemn' the action of the
last Republican legislature for its
failure to enact just and adequate
laws on taxation, notwithstanding it
had a twurthirds majority in each
branch thereof, obtained by the un
lawful unseating of four Democratic
inejnbers. -...
.'We favor the Enactment of a law
providing for the deposit with the
stale treasurer of all public funds
held- by state officials, whether in
trust or otherwise, and for the plac
ing of such funds at interest, and re
quiring all financial iustitutons hold
ing such funds to give surety bonds
and we refer especially to the con.
duct of the business of the stale land
office, under which large amounts
of money are held by the land com
missioner without deposit in the
state treasury, or in banks for in
come purposes for the benefit of the
slate.
We charge the Republ.!an party
with responsibility for intentionally
so draftng the laws creat:ig the of
fice of state land commissioner, pre
scribing his duties, powers and Imi
tations as such as to enable him to
extensvely aid and strengthen the
parly machine.
We condemn the present methods
of permitting the state land com
missioner to deposit the fund de
rived from state lands; in hanks for
political and private gain without
the state deriving any income as it
should from this source.
We favor the enactment of a per
manent endowment fund to be 'creat
ed from the moneys derived from the
sale of state lands, the interest from
this fund to he used in the mainten
ance of state instituions, and the
permanent fund to be invested un
der prooer state authority, accord
ing l the constitution and the laws
of the state.
We recommend the immediate fa
vorable action of the United states
senate and the passage of the sec
tion grazing homestead bill.
We .recommend the elimination
from forest reservations of lands in
capable of producing merchantable
timber of commercial value, and are
not essential to the protection of
watersheds. v
.We further recommend that the
forest homestead act of June 11, 1906,
which permits entry of grazing lands
in equal proportion to the agricul
tural lands listed anil allowed for en
try, and we further recommend that
the act be amended to permit an
entry of 320 acres.
We' favor the enactment of a law
empowering persons aiuf' corpora
tions engaging in coal mining to con
demn lands for right of way pur
poses. We favor the enactment of a law
providing for the furnishing of freo
school books to the school children
of the state.

licial record, with a history of reniov
al from office by an executive of his
own party because of it. There are
no tools of the Invisible Government
in the list: no representatives of cor
porate greed and unequal taxation
no violators of ballot boxes and pil
ferers of elections; no franiers of
vicious legislation and promoters of
unscrupulous politics. Nothing but
clean, honest, capable, efficient Anier
icans, who have achieved success
and renown, and who stand four
square to the wind of public opinion.
Andrieus A. Jones, of Las Vegas, a
national figure in the United States
today, described by Governor Mc
Donald before the Democratic con
vention as the "foremost citizen of
New Mexico," whose work as first
assistant secretary of the interior is
a matter of statewide pride; and
whose exceptional ability is recog
nized by the leading men of the
country, is a Democratic candidate
for U. S. Senator anil stands as a
tower of strength al the head of
the ticket. Ill place beside him,
as'the congressional nominee, is the
Slate Senator William 11. Walton, of
Grant county, a man who for years
has been one of the most earnest
and determined workers for the
Democratic cause, in his county und
in the state; who has been repeat
edly honored by the people of his
district, and who is particularly
qualified to represent New Mexico
in the lower house of Congress.
"You have nominated for Congress,"
the state executive told the con-
j vention, " a man who will carry the
I banner of Democracy as few men
i can carry it."
(n nominating K'zequiel C. de Haca,
of San Miguel county, for governor
of New Mexico, the Democratic par
ty announced to the world that with
in its ranks every citizen of the state
is regarded only as an American,
and that every man is judged sole
ly on his merits and honored in ac
cordance with them.
