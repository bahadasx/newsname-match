crowded with pupils, teachers and
.patges of the school, and much in
`.. terest was manifested in making the
coming term a success.
T.he enrollment in the different

Ex-State High School Conductor,
Lao M. flavrot, of Baton Rouge, visit
qd the school Wednesday and made a
', ry interesting address to the pupils
:ti" ge high school.
. Pf. Park states, for 'the benefit
i~ those beginners who will reach
be eschool age * January 1, 1917,
iad who expect to enter school at
snt later than that date, that it is I
Sadvisable that they be enrolled now.
'he reason for this is that in half
. b year they cannot complete the first
.grade and consequently will be re
^ Quired to remain n this grade for
es ,and one-half years.
By the new Course of Study sent
_ :oat by the State Department of Edu
il_ 'cation, Physical Geography will take
the place of Zoology 'in the eighth
Abita Springs School.
The Abita 'Springs school opened
en Monday, Sept. 4th, with a large
a ttendance, and a number of patrons
prwesent.
Mayor Alex Mutti addressed the
school stressing the necessity for
.. obelience, diligence and perfect at
tendance.
Capt. G. E. Millar made a very in
teresting address urging the child
ren IB realise the need of an educa
tion and make the most of their op
portuntties.
Ater sinaging "America" the child
s .n marched to their classrooms
ready to begin the work of the new
session.
Slidell High SchooL
The Slidell High School opened
Meonda morning. The enrollment
has reached four hundred fifty.
The school day begins at 8:50 and
doses at 3:55. That gives a recess
and an extra period of forty minutes
in the afternoon. The idea is to pro
vidp for more study periods at the
:chool and less at home.
maay of the teachers who were
here at session have returned from "
pleasant vacations and have begun
work again.
tWedding bells rang in the faculty
during the vacation. Miss May Fred- 1
.erick, the 7th grade teacher of 1915
16, was married to Mr. Leimuel C.
Toney, of Hackley, La., after school
closed last June.
Several changes have been made C
in the class rooms. The high school
pupils are on the ground floor.
We will have our formal opening
exercises when Mr. IAddle returns.
Talsheek SchooL
Talisheek will waste no time in
putting up a new school building in

children of St. Tammany parish ,the
best 'educational facilities possible.
Sand Talisheek is not behind other

LEWIS TELLS OF
THINGS SEEN
AND LEARNED
ON HIS TRIP
Visitors Given Auto Rides
and Taken to Stock Farms
and Places of Interest.
CHEAP CATTLE WONT
PAY ON $300.00 LANDS
Prosperous Stock Farms and
Throroughbred Stock
in Wisconsin.
Since I wrote my article last week
I have seen many more good things
that would be of great benefit to our
farmers. I will not try to tell all
in this one article but Will give it
in broken doses. I am afraid to tell
too much at one time for fear that
some one might doubt what I said.
From ,Waukesha; Wis.,. we went to
Ft. Atkinson, Wis. Here we were
met by the mayor and officials of the
Association of Commerce with.auto
mobiles and driven out to the farm
of ex-Gov. Hoard. We have all
n eara of Hoard through his paper.
This farm is managed on as pear a
business basis as anything I ever saW.
A place for everything and every
thing in its place, The fields are
rolling but no red gullies were in
sight and no half fallen buildings
could be seen--nothing but alfalfa,
corn and clover and fat. cows and
horses could be seen. The eattle
owned by Mr. Itoard were absolutely I
perfect in every respect.. The bull 1
heading the herd is a beauty and is
valued at -ten thousand dollars. He
weighs one ton. Mr. Hoarl says that
there- is no place in that country
where scrub cattle or grades of any a
kind can 'be, grown; the farmers can
got affoid to allow them to run on
ianh costing upwards of $300 pir c
acre. iood cattle must be raised on C
high.zriced land to make money, and k
they are-making money. If they can s
maklsadhey with stock costing as V
.high i .$3.300 per cow and $20,000
:for a hardd. bull, on land that cannot a
bedhtd at $300 per acre, and at the l
saime time having to keep this stock n
up in closed boras five months In the s'
year, why is it that we cannot make
money here in St. Tammany parish
with our thuosands of acres of land a
that can be bought for from $8 to $n
$15 per acre, and a growing season
of the entire year? It seems to me
that the trob le must be in us and
not in the co try. Some might say
that they too could do this itf they t
had the money to do it with. Sbme
of he farmers I talked with in Wis
consin did not have the money they a
needed and went to work and made b
good. One man told me that 18 t]
years ago he and his wife started to I
work and with business management
they had built the place up to
what we saw it. He did not tell us
so but one of his neighbors did say fI
that this man Is now worth one hun- ti
dred fifty thousand dollars, and made a
it all farming with pure bred live T
stock. I mention the above case just a
to show that men are self-made in 0
the north, the same as they are any- r
where else. Had this man been in fa
St. Tammany parish he could have *
made this money much easier due to ii
better climatic conditions. n
The dairy herd on this farm is a
worth $55,000, and the farm imple
ments worth several thousand dol- e
lars. Thees men look upon farming a
as a business and they know for any b
business to be run right one must be 7
prepared to do things as they should 4
be done.
The next farm we visited was P
"Wdge Water Stock Fatm," ownbed
by Mr. Harry Curtis. Mr. Curtis has c
as fine a herd of Guernsey cattle as is 0
in the State of Wisconlsin. Some of
his cows give as much as 85 pounds S
of milk per day, going as high as tl
5-1-2 per cent butter fat. Mr. Cur- ft
tis has made a fortune farming end s
has specialized -for the last few years 5
in dairying. He ifinds ready market 24
for all his breeding stock at what if
we would call fancy prices. None ra
are sold under $200 per head, young
or old. We visited other fartns in o
this section. All.were good and up W
to date, but we have not room here 54
to take up each farm. More, will be as
told later about individual farms.
We next went to Madison, Wf's., i
to visit thb State University and A. & a
M. College. Here we were met by hi
Prof. -Geo. Humphreys, dean of the of
College of Animal Husbandry. It W
took us all day to see this magnii- tI
cent institution with all its depart- I1
ments. The experimental plots were 1
fine. One plot was pointed out to us a
upon which nothing but corn an@ S
clover had grown for ten years. The tl
plot next to it had a rotation of corn Ile
tand clor for the same lengtn of tlr
time. TVe'corn where crops had been i
rotated will make 75 busheis per Ut
acre. Caorn on land growing noth- ni
ig bt.eern c or ten years will make c

The Hereford bull at the Wiscon
sin station was floe, being Valued at
ten thousand dollars. The yoangor
bulls are being sold for $500 and 4p.
Very few of the heifers are lord
as they are kept to raise high priced
bulls for the breed stock markets of
the northwest which seems to be un
limited.
The station also has some-choice
Percheron horses. The stallioa widl
weigh 2400 pounds and is ahbeauti
ful as any animal can be. No pic
ture was ever pasnted that eould be
any more perftct than this animal.
They had also some very flae mares
and colts. One colt, just two months
old, weighed 500 poumds and was al
ready sold for $1,000. Thr is all
fancy stock, but the northern farmer
will not have anything else. He says
it pays to raise good stock as it is
not any more trbuble and the profits
are so much greater.
We found out through the Wis
consls Experiment Station that Wis
consin does put out some milk and
butter every year. She ptoduces
750 pounds of butter every minute,
45,000 pounds every hour, 340,000
pounds every day and 131,000,000
pounds every year. That is some
butter! The milk and butter pro
ceeds of Wisconsin in one year runs
over two hundred million dollars.
We saw a champion Holstein bull
at the Wis.onisn station, 4 years old,
that weighed 2250 pounds-a per
fect animal in every repect. We
saw a fine herd of Duroc Jerieys, six
months of age, that would average
200 pounds each. These bho were
fed as hogs need to be fed to grow off
rapidly.
The trip through the state of WIs
consin was one of value, and every
where we went, and as far as I could
see, was one prosperous farm after
another.
The many miles of model roads,
flne residences, barns, fields of clover
and alfalfa, fine crttle, bogs. and
horses, made me want to have some
of these people see Ot. Tammany
With her many opportunities. I know
that with the same effort put forth
more money oeul4 be made here and
more pleasure bhdIn.making it. Its
no fun to shovel snow around for
five months in the year and feed cat
