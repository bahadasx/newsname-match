Do you expect to escape' This
is u capitalist nation, and capi
talism works the same the world
over. Basil Manly is the man who
wrote the majority report ol the
Industrial Relations Commission
of which he wns a member. He is
uot a Socialist, but a political
economist who seems to have no
strings on him. Of the end of the
European war he draws this pic
ture :
What is going to be the econ
omic outcome of the European
war''
"Most of the economists who
have discussed this question have
based their prophesies on wn.it
they call the enormous destruc
tion of capital,' ami have wept a
few tears at the thought of the
dreadful fate thut awaits the
foreign capitalist. What are the
facts ?
"It is Important for every Am
erican to understand because, un
less we do understand and act in

In a nutshell, this will be the
situation when the war is over.
The capital property ol the war
ing nations will be little, if ut
all impaired.
This needs explanation. The

ces nnd means of production and
transportation. Except tor the
fact that certain natural resour
ces, chiefly iron ore, are being
used up faster than in times of
peace, there is practically no im
pairment of the capital goods of
any of the nations, except in the
relatively limited area in which
the war will be fought out.
"This destruction is more than
offset by the enormously created

rope w ill and must have her mar
kets back to dispose of her sur
plus products. Otherwise her in
dustries would soon become clog
ged and her people starve for the
want of employment. The Amer
icnu capitalist knows this, there
fore his government is propuring
to hold the stolen markets at any
cost. That is the meaning ol all
this "preparedness.'1 No one has
been able to give any other intel
ligent reason for it.
Hut what are you going to uo
about it? If you vote an oiu
party ticket you cannot escape
voting lor this game ol lOOl una
murder, both the Democratic anu
Republican parties are lor "preparedness.''
Hence there IS out one escape.
The Socialist part' is theom.v po
litical party that is dead set a-
gainst the program of the plun-
derbund. it is against muiwisiu
and the profit system that breeds
w ars as surely us a swamp oreeai
malaria.
You have read the bluster ol
Hughes und Roosevelt, and tne
piffle of Wilson on preparedness.
Now 1 want you to reau use
fully what Allen L. Benson, soci
alist candidate for president, says
about it :
"Nothing but a tremendous So
cialist vote this fan can preveut
this nation from plunging over
the Niagara of militarism at tne
bottom of which is war.
noth the Democratic and tne
Republican parties have deserted
thp cause of peace.
Upon the great issue that nas
non fronted this nation siuee its
foundation, they have left the
people no place to go except into
the Socialist parti .
What have the gentlemen wno
control these old parties done
They have caused the House oi
Representatives to concur in tne
Senate amendments to the naval
appropriation bill.
what does the naval appropria
tion bill mean?
It means that this nation, next
year, is to be saddled with expen
ditures for the army nnd navy
that aggregate $001,418,000!
This is a greater sum than any
nation at peace ever appropriat
ed for military purposes in a sin
gle year!
Make no mistake ! It is a
greater sum thau any nation at
peace ever appropriated for mili
tary purposes in a single year!
We have lamented the militar
ism of Germany, but Uermany In
time of peace, never kuevv such
military expenditured as these.
We have stood almost aghast
at the size and power of the Brit
ish navy, but England never piled
upon her people in a single year
of peace such tremendous bur
deus as Mr. Wilson and the Dem
ocratic congessuien have now pil
ed upon the American people.
We stand alone in the world's
history and among the world's
nations in the I size of a single
year's military expenditures In
time of peace.
Va Iriuttv that the people of
Qei'inany and the people of Eng
land desire peace, precisely as we
know that the America n people
desire peace.
But we also know there were
some powerful men in Europe
who did uot desire peace ut the
price of profits.
We know thut the war iu Eu
rope is a trade war, based upon
the desire of some governments
to obtain advantages that would
give them increased facilities for
foreign trade.aud the determina
tion of other governments uot to
be stripped of their advantages.
And, if we who are here in
America know anything, we
know that the American capital
ist class, which dominates both
of the old parties, is and for
months has been exerting itself
to the utmost, not only to get
trade that Europe has lost, but
to hold it after Europe is at peace.
Only the other day, the as
tounding statement was published
in the press that America Is now
building more merchant ships
than are being built by all the
other nations of the world?
These ships are intended to
carry American goods to markets
that formerly bought European
goods.
American capitalists well know
that after the war is ended, Eu
ropean capitalists will make tre
mendous efforts to wrest from
America the foreign trade that,
before the wur, was held by i-u-ropti
American capitalists know that
a struggle ai first legislative
uud diplomatic is bound to UOIUC
between them and their foreign
compettltors,
WMn this struggl. comes. A-
mericuu capitalists warn. u oe in
a iMjsitiou to say to the rest 01
the .world : "iou mind j our lousi
ness. H you try to get your
trade buck, you will get luco
trouble. We ure prepared to
shoot and shoot witn big guns'
Wnat will be the resuit.' Are
Euiopeau capitalists likely quiet
ly to lie down iWttite American
capitalists hog the earth? The)
will do nothing oi the sort. They
will prepare to fight us. Eng
land, as our most lormidable
trade rival, will most fiercely re
sent the assumption of American
capitalists that the world's trade
is for them. And, in the course
of a few years, we s.iad be forced
Into such a wai as we ncvei had.
Why should we deliberate ,i in
vite such u calamity.' What have
the American people to gain from
foreign trade? Capitalists gain
hundreds of millions. But 'what
have the common people of Amer
icathe farmers and -factory
workers to gain? Only one
thing. An increased opportunity
to work. Thut is all. An in
creased opportunity to work. If
it were possible for American
capitalists to grab and hold the
bulk of the world's trade, then
would be a greater demund iu
America for work. The army of
the unemployed, w hloh often
amouuts to four or five millions
would be smaller, and might en
tirely disappear. Rut wages
would be kept down to the cost of
existence, precisely as they are
now kept down to the point of
existence. At this very moment.
American capitalists are profit
ing to the extent of hundreds of
millions annually as the result of
an unusual volume of foreign
trade, but wages are only bare
ly high enough to reach the con
stantly rising cost of living. A
merica has. to such a degree as
it has seldom if ever before had,
prosperity caused by foreign
trade. Almost everybody has
plenty of work, but nobody ex
cept the capitalists are getting
anything but a living out of it.

ting hundreds of millions d'j not

Is it worth while to invite a
terrible war merely to get more
work?
Why should the American peo
ple be so eager to strip their
country of B0 much that they
produce?
Would it not be wiser so to
change conditions that Americans
can use and enjoy their own pro- j
ducts instead of permitting cup
italists to export them for their
own enrichment?
The Socialist view Is that
Americans should be permitted to
consume what they produce, and
lour aim Is to bring this about bv
having the people, through the
government, take charge of pro
duction and carry it on for their
own benefit. The present capi
talist system turns over product
ion to private capitalists to be
carried on for their benefit.
Why is their system good and
our s.v stent bad?
If the American people are to
keep out of war, some day they
Will have to answer this question
for themselves and put their on
swer In the form of law.
As matters are tending, we are
as surely headed toward war as a
meteor W ithin the earth's clutch
is headed for the earth.
We cannot attempt to grab and
hold the world's trade without
setting the world's str ongest na
tions at our throat.
Mr. Morgan and Mi . Rockefeller
may think they can do it. nnd Mr,
Wilson may think it can be dune.
THE WHY OF IT ALE.
The pardoning Of that default
ing bank cashier Tindle of Car
uthersville, whose speculations
caused a number of business fail
ures, compelled schools to close
and put the county on the rugged
edge of bankruptcy, compels one
tO ask the quest, on, why spend SU
much time and money in prosecu-
tion if the punishment is to be set
aside? Such deeds aie not prone
to cautte either respect or fear
for the law, nor fear of w rong
doing, just so it i done on a large
scale -.Jackson Items.
The editor of the Jackson Item
does not even seem to underntan i
the system he defends, and. there
fore, is ignorant of Why a hank
er should be so BfiSily pardoned.
Bro, Kie-, did you ever know of
a banker who robbed the masses
going to prison arid not being
pardoned? If he robs other capi
talists, that Is a violation of the
rules of the game. B it when
only the common people are rob

part of the play.
It almost never occurs that a
'capitalist is sent to prison f r

Returning to Tindle, Bro. Kles,
I will put you next to b profound j
secret that only Labor and So
cialist papers dare tell, There
are two very distinct classes of I
society, known as the capitalist
class and the working class,
The capitalist class is In control j
of the pardoning power. Mr.
Tindle was of the capitalist class,
He helped to create the power
that set him free. When Mr. Tin
dle was taken to the jienitentiary
to remain ten years, I knew he
would be there but a short time.
