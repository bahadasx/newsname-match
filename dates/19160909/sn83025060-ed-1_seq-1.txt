Chicago Tilbune promptly reminds
him that an honest Judge must apply

he thinks it ought to be; and asks
him to tell tlioM who look to him

Hughes snjs the country can't be
saved b.v letting It dilft. That's where
he and Wilson differ.
Washington repot ts that n new apol
ogy has been sent to I'll st Chief Cur
ruimi. Looks like a habit.
Mr. ISr.van Is mistaken when he snys
Hughes Is "vltilollc." The candldute
Ih meielj applying the acid test.
A messenger of President Wilson
found out that Coloiatlo women wote
for the adinlnlstiatlon. Xo messenger,
of com so, can bo blamed for making
good.
Polltlc.il opponent" are beginning to
thttl that why Mr. Hughes kept silence
so long wasn't because he had lost
Ids tongue.
Another encouraging feattue about
our new navy Is that when It Is com
pleted, Mr. Daniels will not be Secre
tary of It.
Having discovered that the Demo
crats don't like whnt he Is sajlng, Mr.
Hughes doubtless Is convinced that
Itu is on the right truck.
POLITICAL JOTTINGS
At that, however, from beginning
to end this has been more of a "jou

Vnnco McCormlck says tho Progres
Blves are stampeding to Wilson, and
It's a ten to one bet ho wlbhcs he
could believe It.
Tho Democrats are finding out that
pork comes home to root out their
Btundlug.
The men nnd women who prefer a

writes notes about them will Tote

spondence takes too long to get any-
