My ARTIIIR S. DRAPER.
I.ondon, Sept. ?.. -Britain's raply ta
the American protcst againat the black
list will be rendj soon. I can state
definitely that the government has not
altered its view and ia not likely to,
despita the retallatory BBaaaaraa
adopted by the American A'ongrcss.
i.ord Robert Cocll, sfiaister of War
Trade. said to-day that an effort to en
force the Thomas amendmant, givmg
tha I'resident power to refuse clearance
to vesscl? which discritninate against
American firms, might lead to friction
between the I'nited States and Britain.
"If, because of |ts power we, yield to
*he I'nited States." said I.ord Kobert,
"?e must ncce?saniy yield to gmaller
neutrala who hava not your strength.
Ihe black lists are a war measure not
to injure neutrala, but to protect our
selves. We are trying to cripple Cer
many AnaBclaUy, though it is diflieult
to say just how much efTect the hlack
havintr, but certainly marks are
faiiing. dbviously, in a war of this
mairr.itude. ? -st n"'i" ? oir<
inconvenience, but we are anxious to
Itisstn this as much aa possible.
No Deaire to Hurt l . S.
"l>en if we could, it would be poor
policy if we tried even to cripple or
injure American trade. Our rommer
cial interests are too closely bmind up,
nnd any injury to America would re
act on u?."
He aeemed to think that America had
confused the b'ackliat and the Paris
conference rreommendations aa one
war measure, where as tha latter is
primarily Intended to meet (Jerman po
'itical and rommcrcial activities after
the war and also to bring about eco
nomic rOCOBStntCtion among the Allies
nt the close of hostilitiea.
Trade War Not Soughl.
"There is no politidafl in this coun?
try," I.ord Robert addcd, "who wants a
?rade war with America. I.egitimate
eonpctitlofl i? another question. r'?>r
a time our interests ar8 centred on
winning the war, and we certainly ara
not considering methods to injure the
country with whom our trade relations
are so eloaa, I will aay that the re
stnction on the imtmrtation of Ameri?
can tobacco wai due solely to lack of
space in tranaatlartie steamers, the to?
bacco making way for neceasary food
commodities. The same rulings hold
for motors, ira, etc 11 munt be re
membered that Creat Hntain is at a
?erioui stag" of th* war. where inter
national relations are guided not by
philonthropy or frloadly feelinga. The
general feeling here is that we want to
ba friendly. but we cannot weaken our
chances through past friendships."
Britain Guards Against

drclined to-day to enter into the de

That waa the waid ProsldOBl Wilaon

"I get a little impatient aomeMmes,"

in tha audienre thought his only refer

the discaastoa al the ehaaBolfl and

Women Are ni?appointed.
But for what every woman in the
vast audience that filled the New Nixon

full sympathy with the auffrage cause.
He told the women that it "not only
had eome to stay, but had eome with

clared, was as cerfnin as the rising of
