Parker '. Ranch Manager Re

For the purpose of arranging data
to be presented to the public utilities

tariff on cattle. Alfred W. Carter,
manager and trustee of the Parker
Ranch, arrived this morning from Ha
waii, called on Attorney C. H. Olson
cf Holmes & Olson, his attorneys,
and visited Inter-Island officials.
"1 saw Mr. Carter for" a few. mo
ments this morning," aaid Attorney
Olson at noon, "but I had no chance
of really discussing his objections to
the new freight rates. His objection,!
however, is that .cattle shippers of
Hawaii are not getting fair service.
That is entirely aside from the ques
tion of rates." . v i - .;:;';
Attorney Olson added that Manager
Carter objects strongly to the Inter
Island sending steamers over to Ka
waihae on such a schedule that cattle
have to be put aboard the vessels on
Sunday. He thinks his . employes .
should not be required to work Sun
days. "The Inter-Island has time and
again sent its boats to Ka waihae to
take cattle on Sunday," added Attor
