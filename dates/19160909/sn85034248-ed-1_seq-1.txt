"Sally in Our Alley." d
When William A. Brady said he t
would personally see that each star n
acting for him would be equipped
with plays suited to his or her re- g
spective talents, he never for a mo- 0
ment thought he would strike the n
nail right on the head with his first t
personally selected play and stars. In t
"Sally in Our Alley," which will be a
the offering at the Gem next Wednes- (I
day, Mr. Brady presents Carlyle t
Blackwell and Muriel Ostriche in a n
play which fits both these versatile
stars like a glove. The eye of the c
camera takes the spectator from the s
slums of New York to its palatial li
twellings, and the costumes worn s
vary from the ragged garments of the i
lower east side to the most precious t
gowns of the society folk. Interest- 1
ing as it is unique, abounding in hu- a
man interest, "Sally in Our Alley"
may truly be termed a peerless pro
duction.
"The Reapers."
A treat is in store for patrons of
the Gem next Thursday, when John
Mason and Clara Whipple will be
seen in the gripping Equitable pho
todrama, "The Reapers," wherein is C
exemplified in a vivid manner the
truth of the Biblical injunction, "As
ye sow, so shall ye reap."
Albert Jordan is a business man,
earning a fair salary, which he lavish
es foolishly on his selfish and narrow
wife. One day, returning from work,
he sees his little daughter in the path
of a speeding automobile. Leaping
to snatch her from instant death, he
is himself struck and seriously injur
ed. Half paralyzed and unable to
work, he must resort to selling news
papers and pencils from a wheelchair.
Rita, his wife, is forced to become the
breadwinner. She frets against her
hard lot, and meeting Jim Shaw, a
race-track follower and former ad- C
mirer, she deserts her husband and I
little daughter to go the easier way
with the gambler.
Jordan becomes an embittered
blasphemer, losing faith in God and
man, until a good woman assists him
to lead a better life. He forgets his
litany of hate against his faithless i
wife; his prayers are heard; he feels
the effects of his faith in the Divine i
Master, and his health is restored to
him little by little. On the other t
hand, Rita has been living in luxury
roduntil . things o wgith
her. Returning to New York he takes
advantage of the tango eraze to start
a low brow dance hall, forcing Rita
to become his accomplice.
Edna, Jordan's little girl, has now
grown into womanhood and -married
Frank Rollins, assistant district at
torney. Going on a vice crusade with
Rollins, Jordan comes face to face
with his wife, who is having a quarrel
with Shaw in the dance hall. The
son-in-law plans to close the place
and chase the couple out of town.
Jordan seeks his wife and points out
to her the true way of living. She
is touched by his willingness to for
give and forget, and her better na
ture rising to the emergency, she re
nrounces her evil life and returns to
her husband.
"The Primal Lure."
The story of "The Primal Lure,"
a virile Triangle play which is book
ed for presentation at the Gem Sat
urday, Sept. 16, has for its locale a
remote outpost of the Hudson Bay
Company in the early days of the
Canadian northwest.
The leading figure, played by Wil
liam S. Hart, is Angus McConnell,
factor of the outpost, which is digni
fied by the name of Fort Lu Cerne.
The summer has been disastrous for
the trappers, and they are deeply in
the company's debt for provisions.
Angus keeps account of what they
owe in a little book, and one night this
precious book disappears. Angus
vows all manner of vengeance on the
culprit who has taken it. He keeps
close watch on the office, and at last
he beholds Lois Le Moyne, belle of
the outpost, rummaging about his
desk.
Unknown to him, she has come to
make him a gift of a beautiful pair of
moccasins, made with her own fair
hands, so he concludes she is the
thief, and has her thrown into the
gaol.
Then Richard Sylvester, the com
pany inspector, comes to Fort Lu
Cerne on his rounds. He sees Lois,
falls in love with her, and has her re
leased. On his promise that he will
have Angus dismissed as factor and
himself appointed, she agrees to wed
him. This he accomplishes, and An
gus takes to the trail alone. But be
fore the wedding can take place an
epidemic of sickness breaks out, and
in terror the cowardly Sylvester flees
with his bodyguard.
Angus, who has heard that the
Blackfeet Indians are about to de
scend on the outpost to demand a
white person to be sacrificed as an of
fering to the god who has brought
down the plague, happily returns at
this time and resumes the reins of au
thority. The Indian attack takes
place, and after a thrilling fight, in
which the whites are greatly outnum
bered, Angus goes forth to offer him
self as the victim. He is miraculous
ly saved, however, and returns to the
fort. But he finds that all the garii
son have gone save Lois; and with
these two great enemies .alone in a
terrible situation there comes about
a great finish to a remarkable film.
"The Girl of Lost Lake."
The Grand Theatre will offer as its
Sunday attraction the latest Bluebird
release, "The Girl of Lost Lake,"
featuring Myrtle Gonzales. This pic
ture demonstrates that plays may be
gripping and forceful, appealing to
the popular instinct and satisfying
every class of "picture fans" without
depending upon crime problems or
the slightest infractidh of the crimi
nal or moral code.
Here is a play embodying the rug
ged healthfulness of mind and body;
of life under the "blue canopy," a
mid the fir and balsam of the moun
tainside, with health and strength
typified in every character. There
are new side-lights to the old and en
during emotion of honest love; a new
treatment of the ancient theme of
morality and manliness.
Myrtle Gonzales and a splendid
company of Bluebird artists give the
sto'y the freedom a fullness of de
lineation that the r ged and whole
sole photoplay demands, and the
Sia1ra Nevada mountains have con
tributed the nature settings which
have never been surpassed for beauty
and loveliness since the advent of an
imated photography.
"The Heart of Paula."
"The Heart of Paula," with L
Ulrich in the leading role, will b
attraction at the Grand Monday.
Stephen Pachmann starts for M
ico to appraise a mine. His wife fea

the trip in Stephen's name.
Bruce succeeds to the point of a
riving in Piedro Blanco, where I

His attentions to the beautiful an
alluring Spanish girl arouse the i
tense jealousy of Emiliano Pachec
a guerilla leader.
Pacheco conspires to have B

on the way to the mine.
Stephen's wife learns of his

Bruce is married. Her love tur
Ihate. 'Tis when she learns the truth
that "The Heart of Paula" triumphs
over a complexity of situations and
predicaments that contribute to make
a wonderful story of love, intrigue,
Spanish romance anal sentiment.
"The Race."
A Lasky feature in which two shin
ing lights of the motion picture firma
ment are effectively co-starred, "The
Race," will be the Wednesday offer
ing at the Grand. Anita King plays
the part of Grace Vandyke, and Vic
tor Moore is seen as Jimmy Grayson.
The latter, after losing $10,000 in
facturer. Jimmy is standing on a
street corner a few minutes 'later
when an automobile driven by a beau
tiful young feminine chauffeur strikes
and slightly injures him. The owner
of the automobile, a kind-hearted el
derly woman, secures employment for
young Grayson as a garage mechanic,
and when the young woman chauffeur
l Iearns that he has no home she takes
him to her father's house.
Her father, Andrew Vandyke, is a
clerk in the office of Grayson, the au
to manufacturer. The younger Gray
son and Vandyke design a new car
buretor, and in order to make a num
ber of models, Vandyke steals $9000
from the firm. Grace learns of her
father's crime, and in an effort to pro
tect him she accepts an offer of an
automobile firm to drive a machine
across the continent. She is instruct
ed to beat the Grayson car, which is
making a similar trip, but she does
not know it is being driven by Jimmy.
Young Grayson is unaware that he
is racing against the plucky girl.
There are many thrilling scenes in
the trans-continental run. The race
ends when Grace, given the wrong
route, drives over an embankment.
Jimmy finds her, hears her story and
decides to go to jail. He deliberate
ly breaks his machine and is towed in
r to New York by Grace's car.

SUES ON INSURANCE POLICY.
Maryland Company Held Liable for
Large Sum by Mrs. J. P. Kock.
A suit to recover $60,000 on an in
surance policy, and $5000 attorney's
fees, with 5 per cent per annum on
both from November 1, 1915, was
filed against the Maryland Casualty
Company last week before the Uni
ted States district court in New
Orleans by Mrs. Marie Alice Aldige. I
widow of the late J. P. Kock, owner
of Belle Alliance plantation, who is
alleged to have died as a result of in
juries September 1, 1915. The orig
inal amount of the policy and a rid
er was $30,000, but Mrs. Kock avers
that, under the laws of Louisiana per
taining to insurance companies, the
delinquent company forfeits to her,
by reason of its failure to pay said
policy, double the original amount.
The $5000 additional prayed for is
held to be a just demand on account
of her having to sue the principal.
The petition sets forth that on Jan
uary " 1913. the Maryland Casuziy
Comp ' issued to James P. Kocl a
$20,000 policy, he to pay an annual
premium of $120. On February 10,

this policy, whereby it was agreed

The five big reasons WHY Budweiser sales exceed

BECAUSE Anheuser-Busch rigorously obey every

BECAUSE they pay premium prices for extra fine

BECAUSE they import only the cream of Saazer Hop
crops, of which their giant Storage houses contain
the world's largest supply.
BECAUSE they brew Budweiser in the finest and

BED-TIME STORIES
By Master Bernard Lemann
(Exactly as written)
The Escape.
In a little village at t base of
Mount Vesuvius tlhre once lived a
sheperdess who was a widow. She
had but one child that was but a few
months old.
One morning she went out to drive
her flock into the pasture. And a., srhl
opened the door of the barn in which
they were kept for the night, out ran
some frisky little lambs and three
mean lookiri rams for a day's frolic.
The sheperdess turned to walk
home. But when she reached there
she saw that her child was gone. She
asked a man who was passing if he
had seen the child ajd he answered,
"yes," that the childhad been stolen
by the pagan priest and was to bel
sacrificed to the gods.
There was no time to waste. The
mother hastened. She thought she
would be late.
Just as the child yas about to be
put into the bosom o' the great iron
god and burned, the earth began to
shake, the thunder roared and the
volcano shot up lava and red hot
coals. The priest dropped the baby
and fled.
The mother at last reached the
temple and picked up the baby and
she fled too. She ran to the water's
edge and pushed a skiff into the water
and rowed to the middle of the lake.
And as the sun went down, leaving
the glowing sunset in its place, the
mother could see land. She then
rowed faster than ever and at last
landed.
The sheperdess stepped out of the
skiff with the baby still in her arms.
And after wandering in the twilight a
while she saw a light in the distance.
She walked until she came to the
door of a little cabin. She gave a
light tap at the door. An bid man
opened the door and invited them in.
He gave them food and drink.
It was soon decided that the shep
erdess and her child would share the'
home of the old man. He was very
kind to them but after a few years
he died of old age.
On the day of his death the shep
erdess and her son (who was now
seven years old) built a small sail
boat and that night they sat it upon
the waters that glittered in the moon
light and sailed away.
The mother had always longed for
her native land but she would not
leave the old man alone. And now
she felt happier than she ever had
been as she sailed back to the little

THE JEFFERSON- HIGHWAY.
Louisiana to Be Important Link in C
"Vacation Route of America."
New Orleans and Winnipeg, Cana
da, are to be connected by a hard sur- to
faced road, good in rain or shine, to ti
be known as the Jefferson Highway. it
The route through Missouri, Iowa, n
Minnesota and Canada has been se- b
lected and dedicated, and is now be- b
ing hard surfaced. tl
South of Kansas City, only the high a
points have been named, The exact d
route to be followed between Shreve-l t
port and New Orleans remains to be si
selected, and will be determined by J. a
D. Clarkson, general manager of the C
Jefferson Highway AssOciation, after
an inspection tour he will soon make f
through Louisiana. I
His selection will be based on feas- c
ibility of road building, Willingness of b
the parishes and towns to build the d
sort of road required, interest in high- v
!yay construction, and the promptness ti
-ith which Jefferson Highway local u
associations are organised in the in- n
terested parishes. . v
A show of lethargy o~ lack of in- j
terest will, probably resilt in the loss c
of the highway to an adjoining parish y
where an active interest in its bene- r
tits is apparent. e
The project is entisely voluntary. c
No town or parish need fear the high- u
way will be "wished" on them. The l4
highway will be routed only where v
it is wanted. k
All along the way.n4rth of Louisi- s'
ana, every possible raobte entered a b
strenuous contest for designation as
the Jefferson Highwayk;.a d the people p
in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, s
Iowa, Minnesota, and: Canada who v
have secured the highway deem them- o
selves so fortunate that they have t
all gone to work with aP will to com- t
plete their sections at the earliest c
possible time. '
During nine months past there has I
been a contest on between two roads c
connecting Kansas Cit;y and Joplin, d
Missouri, a distance ~f 170 miles. c
By agreement, the Jeffetson Highway e
designation is to ga t<i:the road on
which the greatest nutber of miles t
of hard surface is place by a given v
date. So keen is the ; ivalry that, t
during several months, t.e road build- c
ers on both routes ope*ed all night t
by electric lights, as well as all day. c
Near Staples, Min, there was, a 1
bad hill. The highway party of in
spection were delayed four minutes c
getting over it in July,' The delay x
was mentioned to theIbusiness men
of Staples, and in five minutes they,
raised $2000 'with woi.h to reduce
the hill to a proper gda "We want
our section of the J >n Highway
to be just as good as w make it,
highway sixty eet wide to he border
as its contribution to the 'Jefferson a
Highway.
s In Iowa, E. T. Meredith, president
s of the Jefferson. Highway Assoeiation,
r is a leading candidate for the gover
a norship. His chief' issue is good
r roads.
I The Jefferson Highway traverses
only a small portion 6f the northeast
corner of Texas, and the fortunate
counties have already voted a bond
issue of $3,500,000 for the hard sur
facing of their portion of the road.
In Missouri, the people have wel
comed the Jefferson Highway for
three reasons. They say:
"It will reduce the cost of moving
our farm products to market."
"It will cause connecting hard sur
faced roads to be built in Missouri to
the extent of at least 100 miles for
every mile of the Jefferson Highway
trunk line."
Paul Nesbit, president of the Okla
homa division of the Jefferson High,
way Association, says: "We regard
the Jefferson Highway as an asset of
the greatest possible value to Okla
homa. It will bring tens of thousands
of visitors to our state. They will see
the opportunities we have to offer,
and in that way we can draw fresh
capital and new people. That's what
we need most."
Walter Parker, general manager of
the New Orleans Association of Com
merce, said: "If Louisiana promptly
delivers her section of the Jefferson I
Highway, and the parishes between
Baton Rouge and New Orleans eme,
bellish their road by planting palm
trees along the way, we will attract
100,000 automobiles a year from the
north within the next three years.
Many of the people who come south
-over the highway will buy rich Louis
iana lands, and sell their less fertile I
but higher priced lands in the north."
Every town between Shreveport
I;nd New Orleans should see to it that
both Mr. Clarkson, on his preliminary
tour, and the official highway party,
which will come south in November,
be convinced that Louisiana wants
the Jefferson Highway, welcomes it,
and stands ready to do its share of
the work.
Within a few months the Jefferson
Highway Association will send a road
building demonstration train over
the road between Winnipeg and New
Orleans, and will build one mile of
highway in each county or parish de
siring it to do so.
In a short while, the highway marks
reading, "Jefferson Highway-New
Orleans to Winnipeg-From Pine to
Palm," will be ready to be placed at
every cross roads all the way from
New Orleans to Winnipeg.
The Jefferson Highway is known as
"the vacation route of America."

"Members of the class of 1916 and
fellow-members of the associatioi:
The honor of presenting the alumni
colors to the class of 1916 having
Sbeen conferred upon me, I shall en
deavor to state briefly and simply
what significance this h# In my es
timatip it means simply this: First,
we wit you to realize that you are
now one with us, that we shall al
ways be interested in your affairs, re
joice with you in your joys and suc
cesses, and sympathize with you in
your trials and losses. Wkwish you to
realize that in putting forth your bee
efforts for success in life you reflec
credit not only upon yourselves, bu
upon this association through our be
loved school in which we are all so
vitally interested. We hope this
knowledge will help to keep alive a
spirit of 'never-say-die' in all of your
battles along the journey of life.
"Second, I wish to plead for those
principles for which this association
stands. I may add that I am sure it
will only be necessary to remind you
of these, since there must be some
thing wrong with the person to whom
they are not instinctive. These prin
ciples may be summed up in on
word, and that word is LOYALT
It may be that we are not alw
conscious of it, but I am sure
deep in the hearts of each and e
one here tonight this sentimen
ever-present.
"In closing, therefore, let me say
that we assure you of a most hearty
welcome into our association, and add
that when we present to you the
colors of our association we ask you
to stand with us for the best interests
of the Dutchtown High School first,
last, and all the time."
