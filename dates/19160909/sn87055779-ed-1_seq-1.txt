JOINT PATROL OF
LINE SUGGESTED
American Commission Takes
Up Question of With
drawing Troops.
Int rn.itionjl News Service:
STAY LONDON, Conn.. Sept. f.
Consideration of the .-overal xlans
for joint protection of the border to
prevent future incursions from the
Meixcan side today occupied the
American cmmi--sion here. Mem
bers of the Mexican commission,
with the exception of Senor JJonillas,
were in New York. Mr. Mott of the
American commission, was absent
alo in New York, on private busi
ness. The plans suppc.stod by the Mexi
can commission for uanlim: the in
ternational boundary are these:
1 Joint patrol by a specified
number of American and Mexican
troops, with an international agree
ment that either body be permittee'
to f)llow a "hot trail' in pursuit of
bandits .er the border.
2 A joint patrol, with the neu
tralization of a strip 20 miles wide
on each side of the horded; all citi
zens of both countries to be dis
armed within the limits of the neu
tral strip.
" A suthcient KU;trantee by the
Parran.a government that all ban
Hits will bo driven from the terri
tory contiguous to the border, with
a reserve of American troops at a
distance from the border for addi
tional security.
The present plan of tho American
commissioners, it became known to
day, is to conshier together tho
o,ustion r.f tho withdrawal of
American troops and means for jr
teotion of the border. The latter
question, which (en. Parranza wish
es to ;. Iecitb'l rirst, is so compli
cated by the reported presence of
Villa in Chihuahua ami so hound up
in the border iiiestion that tho
American commissioners deem it
inadvlsabb" to recommend tho with
drawal of American troops from
Mexico before an arrangement is
agreed upon for such protection of
the brder that the fin uro presence
of American forces will be unnec
t ss.i ry.
It i understood hero that one or
i oth of thesf questions will be
m ttled befoie Wednesday of next
w-k .and submitted to Washing
ton and Mexico City for ratification.

XPW YdllK, Sept. t. The Cen

appi oximately T.'o't.oao men anl
women workers today authorized
the ijppointment of a ommittee
with full power to call a. preneral
symiathetic strike in all trades if
such action is deemed necessary to
help the striking traction employes
prain recognition of their union tn
the strucrclo with the Interboroiish
Rapid Tram it and New York Rail
ways Co. This action was taken
after an all-niht session at the
libor temple during which the tr.ac
tion companies were assailed for
heir threat to clcstroy the Amal-
paated Aw?iation of Street and !
l'lectric Railway Krnployes. I
This threat of a sympathetic strike
by the Central Federated union and j
the announcement hy the Isew lonci
Railways Co. that strike-breakers
would be used on its surface lines
made this the third day of the
strike a crucial period in the
stnitrcle. Up to today the company
nas run only a reduced number of
cars, usinpr employes who had re
mained loyal, but when strike
breakers be sin operations it i ex
Pxtecl that many of those hitherto
loyal will walk out and that mark
ed disorder will follow.
Hope For Settlement.
City officials began the day with
their hopes of a settlement of the
strucsrle steadily lessening. The
growing pessimism was reflected, in
Mayor Mitchel's statement that he
was determined that order should
bo maintai-.ed in tho city, the safe
ty of the travelling public insured
and protection given to life and
property."
one o'clock this afternoon is the
set time for the expiration of the
traction officials' ultimatum ordering
the return of the striking employes.
Yithin a short time after that hour
the companies expect to know how
many striko-breakers will have to
ho held for duty on the elevated and
si. bw ay lines. The remainder, un
derstood to number about 4,500, wi'.l
he turned over to 4 he New York
Railways Co. for service on the sur
face linos.
This company has announced its
purpose of pivinc a 2i-hour service
hereafter. Hitherto it has runs into
the barns at 6 o'clock, or as near
that hour as possible. and kept
them there until 5 a. m. This has
proented any ni-ht rioting, but
whon servico is attempted after
l.trk the city ofTieials fear an out
burst of lisorder.
The strikers received help from a
new source today. Pres't Johnson
P. Riley of the district council of
tho International longshoremen's

ordered members of the Tidewater
Poatmen's union not to handle coal
