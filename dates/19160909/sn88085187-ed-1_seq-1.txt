WOMAN TELLS OF HER
REMARKABLE STRUGGLE
TO BRIDGE SEX GULF
BY FRED L. BOALT
My word of honor lihb been given to Robert Gaffney that I
■will not tell you whore she is living.
She sent for me, and because 1 knew something of her strange
history, 1 went to her hiding place in an out-of-the-way spot In
Oregon.
After 20 years she has returned to her right name—and petti
coats. But, for the purposes of this narrative, she shall be known
to you, as she was known to me when 1 first knew her six months
ago, as —Robert Gaffney.
She was In difficulties, you will recall, in Seattle six months
• go. and garbled bits of her story got into the newspapers.
"I sent for you," she said, "because 1 -want the public to know
that 'Robert Gaffney' is not the strange, sinister creature the re
porters judged her to he. 1 want people to know that Robert
Gaffney' is a clean, honest woman, and that the practice of wearing
men's clothes, which got me Into a terrible dilemma six months
ago, was not as outlandish a thing to do as conventional folks sup
pose. Will you carry my message?"
I promised, and I now fulfill.
• * *
Her mother and sisters were orthodoxly religious people. Per
haps she inherited her eccentricities from her father, who died
when she was young.
She was brought tip on a farm. She liked the out-of-doors.
She married when she was 17. Her husband, too, liked the
out-of-doors. Together they went on long rambles in the moun
tains, fishing and hunting.
That she might the more easily keep up with her hoy husband
on their hikes, she wore men's clothes.
She tells me she was happy with her husband for 10 years.
Then a matter of principle arose —I don't know what it was —and
with a table between them they threshed It out.
They agreed to disagree. He went his way; she hers.
She rebelled against the petticoats that imprisoned her. She
says she wanted to be "free."
She disappeared from the city where she was so well known
and turned up in another place as "Robert A. Gaffney, working
man."
That other place was Spokane. She was, among other things,
8t photographer, a house painter, a farm hand and a Janitor.
It waß in Spokane five years ago that she met Margaret Hart,
abandoned wife, with a baby and another coming. To Margaret
Hart, Robert Gaffney was merely a two-fisted young Irishman who
felt sorry for her.
"Bob" Gaffney was touched by the woman's helplessness.
"I will take care of you until your baby comes and you are
strong enough to return to your father in Colorado." she said.
It Is not strange if the woman misunderstood the nature of
the proposal.
"Wait!" said "Bob" Gaffney. "Can you keep a secret?"
"Yes."
Then Robert Gaffney told her secret for tire first time: "I am
• woman!"
"Our relations," said Robert Gaffney to me, "were the rela
tions of two women, a strong one and a weak one. She was help
less, so I fended for both." '
It was Margaret who Insisted, for the sake of "appearance,"

IMPORTANT TO VOTERS
Voters, here's something Im
portant!
Do you understand about the
first and second choice voting?
c Remember, when you enter the
polls next Tuesday, thta you
MUST oast first and second
. choice votes for candidates for
senator, for congress, for gover
nor, lieutenant governor and all
other state offices where there
are four or more candidates run
ning.
I This Is most Important, because
if you only cast one vote, and do
not signify your second choice,
the vote will not be counted.
Of course, If there are less than
four candidates, only one vote Is
necessary.
But the first and second choice
votes are of prime importance.
Your vote is wasted if you fall to
remember to mark the ballot
twice.
OLD STAMP TAXES
NOT NOW REQUIRED
At midnight Friday night, un
der the emergency revenue -iot
Just passed by congress, stamps
ceased to be required on tele
grams, telephone messages, cos
metics, documents, chewing gum,
railway tickets, seats tn Pullman

people In this slate affected by
the new law, It is though, will be
those who inherit money, and the
Dupont Powder tompauy.

* I'niiiei-oii came hack al the

charge. One chamber was un
affidavit in which he denies
writing to B, I). Crocker,
then political boss, a letter
pledging his vote In the legis

The other chamber was a
letter In which Cameron de
fended his patriotism.
On the other hand, two
men came to The Times of
fice bringing with them what
they say is the original let
ter, which they showed to the
editor. Both, moreover, de
< lai-c that they were present

they are willing to take the

MAYORS
ANSWER
IS 'LIAR'
By A. V. Fawcett
The morning paper says Mr.
Johnson, my opponent for con
gress, made the statement In his
speech last night, that l have
slides running in Grays Harbor
picture shows showing my pic
ture with the inscription beneath:
"Put Tacoma on the Map," his
idea in making the statement oe
ing to show 1 would be against
the rest of the district and only
for Tacoma.
In making such assertion I
want to say as strong as words
can express It that Mr. Johnson
has stamped himself as a plain,
unvarnished and premediated
liar.
Every slide 1 have running In
picture theaters was made at
Scott's studio In this city and
every one of them reads: "The
Third District Should Be on the
apM; Fawcett Will Put It There."
Speaking of Crowds.
Mr. Johnson knows this per
fectly well and his statement la
simply a part of his campaign of
misrepresentation to try to de
ceive the voters and arouse pre
judice against me to cover up his
own weakness and inefficiency.
His whole campaign In this
county has been, according to the
papers backing him, one ot mis
representation.
We have read of his starting
through the county with a great
send-off with 25 automobiles
loaded with boosters on a trip to
Eatonvllle, Alder and Elbe and
Morton, and his great 20-minute
speeches to great cheering, en
thusiastic crowds.
The fact Is, so I am Informed
by witnesses, there was Just one
automobile with Mr. Johnson, his

go the rest of the way alone.
Roosevelt feels — though,
he may not admit It puhlicly
—that he has lie. n tricked.
He probably will not say so
openly, but he is not good at
hiding his feelings, and I find
Roosevelt's disappointment
in Hughes an open secret at
both party headquarters
here.
Roosevelt feels that he did not
step aside for Hughes In order
that the ex-Justice might inaugur
ate a "swat-the-fly" campaign.
He stopped aside because
Hughes agreed to accept tell Issue
Roosevelt hal made for hi in—the
Issue of Americanism —and be
cause Roosevelt, believed a can
dldae standing for this Issue could
defeat Wilson.
He considered the defeat of
Wilson a patriotic duty.
Now, the Roosevelt follow
ing feel that their sacrifice
lihs i.cc.i in vain and that
Wll-son will probably lie re
elected anyhow.
Naturally, Roosevelt Is bitterly
disappointed. He took the Hughes
statement made after the repub
lican nomination at Its face value.
The repetition of it in a milder
form in Hughes' letter of accept
ance he made the most of, but
when Hughes had traveled from
New York to San Francisco with
out a mention of the Roosevelt
issues or an allusion to the Ger
man-American alliance, the
colonel began to realize that
Hughes and his Old Guard back
ing had accepted the issue in the
nominal and technical manner
only, an..' had not intended to
carry out its spirit.
Hughes, In fact, has been tak
ing his real advice from the
Hltchcock-Wllcox-Penrose O l d
Guard.
So Roosevelt decided to show
Hughes and the republican cam
paign managers what he thinks a
candidate ought to talk about.
He thereupon sat down and
wrote his Maine speech which was
delivered In Lewlston Aug. 31, in
which he did not mention the Du
rand case, or, the appointment of
K. Lester Jones, or talk aim it
Myron T. Herrick and the em
bassy at Paris.
Instead he repeated all the

son, specifically mentioning ilia
German-American alliance by
name, Hie l.usltania affair, il,e
killing of K.iiih Cavell, the in
vasion of Belgium, and the "mur
ders" In Mexico.
The speech contains 10,flOO
words all words on subjects not
alluded to by Charles X Hughes
on his western trip.
The success of llnghes de
pends on the extent to whirh.

lowing.
Roosevell could time list
en 11 111; In- by accenting the
pi-OKi-essive nomination.
He could be.il him mm by
denouncing Hughes and bis
following as unworthy of
confidence. ■
It is not likely Roosevelt
will do I his; having made his
derision between Wllmin and
Hughes, he will probably
stand by it.
Hut his tsandtng by it does not
alter the fart as to his disap
pointment and the disappoint
ment of his following.
Nothing can hide the fact that
Hughes has chosen to steer clear
of giving offense to the German-
Americans and la determined to
make a "safe and sane" campaign
on inconsequential issues, rather
than make a slashing anti-admin
istratton campaign on the issues
Roosevelt devised to him.
The effect of the Roosevelt and
progressive disaffection will
eenlually be seen in the lining up
of the progressive vote.
If Hughes had performed so as
to get the real and cordial en
dorsement of Roosevelt a consid
erable proportion ot the Roose
velt vote might have been polled
for Hughes, hut with the Impres
sion spreading daily that Hughes
Is only a respectable "window
dressing" for the Old Guard and
that the power and policies ot
the Hughes administration would
be wielded by Penrose, Hitchcock,
Taft, Wilcox and the rest, many
progressives will be inclined to
take the Wilson end of the alter
native for another four years.
