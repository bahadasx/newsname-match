An exchange remarks: "Why
is'it that a young woman who
appears injured if she imagines
a male passer-by looks above
her shoe-tops, can go to the
beach and take off everything
but a smile, and never turn a
hair."
Kingman has a building boom.
Over twenty rive residences and
business buildings are being
planned for construction prior to
the tirst of the year. A famine
of residences during the past
year has been the cause of the
activity.
John Hennessy, Flagstaff, Ari
zona, on Tuesday, August zy,
shipped eight carloads of lambs
to Kansas City. Julian Garbin-
do, of St. Johns, recently took a
shipment of 2500 lambs to the
same market and they netted
$5.60 after paying all expenses.
The Knights of Columbus will

Monday, September 18, at 9 a.m.
During the summer the build
ings have been renovated and
numerous repairs have been
made. An addition has been
built- to the Drachman school
and cement walks and curbings
have been built at the Holladay
school. All new teachers are
either college or State Normal
school graduates with excellent
records," and everything seems
to indicate a good school year.
What is claimed by mining
men to have been the most re
markable shipment of tungsten
ore ever marketed in Denver,
is to the credit of the Chizona
Mining company of Tip-top dis
trict, which is operating the
Tunsten King property. Prom
24 tons of crude ore shipped to
the Sutton & Steele company,
in that city, the value averaged
$21.50 to the ton. The separa
tion gave 10,478 pounds of first
grade concentrates that assayed
67.7 per cent and settlement was
made on the basis of $45 per
cent unit, $3,046.50 per ton, or a
total value of $lo,840. Miner.
Fortunate this government
which, in peace, with malice to
wards none, without envy, with
out any desire in the direction
of aggression, looks across the
wide ocean upon a shattered
continent and only figures how
it can best contribute after the
war is ended in sympathy, in
deeds, towards the healing of
wounds, the building up of the
spirits of those people and
strengthening them in the effort
to overcome the disasters which
have befallen them. And in
this work our people will know
no German, no French, no Ita
lian, no Russian, no Briton in
hostily, but all as fellow human
beings in misfortune.
President Wilson was given
the lion's share of the credit for
the passage of the Child Labor
bill by Representative Edward
Keating, sponsor of the measure,
in a statement to the Chicago
Journal, which has consistently
advocated this form of federal
legislation. "The mothers of
the land," said Mr. Keating,
"blesspd the president when he
kept us out of war with Europe,
their prayers ascended to heaven
in his behalf when he proposed
a peaceful solution of the Mex
icon difficulty, and now from
Maine to California, they are
calling on God to safe guard
him because he has become the
emancipator of children in in
dustry. Ignacio Bonillas, one of the
three members of the peace com
mission appointed by Carranza
to represent Mexico at the con
ference which begins at Ports
mouth today is well known in
Tucson and Nogales. He taught
school on Congress street 30
years ago and married a sister
of Miss Elizabeth Borton of this
city. He is a graduate of the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology and for a long practiced
as a civil engineer at Nogales
leaving there when he was ap
pointed sub-secretary of com
munications by Carranza. He
understands the American gov
ernment, American spirit, Amer
ican people and their customs.
Tucson Citizen.
Now that the hunting season
is fast approaching, there is
considerable worry as to just
what season holds for the var
ous kinds of game. The Ariz
ona game laws do not conform
with those of the Eederal gov
ernment in some respects and,
consequently the Federal laws
take precedence. The open
season for male deer and turkey
is-from October 1 to December
15; for quail, snipe and rail, Oct
ober 15 to February l;forducks,
geese and brandt, October 15 to
January 3T; doves and white
wings (but not wild pigeons,)
June 1 to February 1; trout,
June 1 to September 1; none un
der seven' inches and limit of
catch-20 pounds per day or not
over forty fish. There is no
open season on antelope, elk,
goat, mountain sheep, female
deer, fawn, road runner, bob
white, grouse, song birds and
pheasants.
Practically all. of the copper
available to the end of the third
quarter of the year has been
placed, says the Mining World,
while that for the fourth quarter
has been put in a strong position
by extensive contracts, which go
far toward absorbing the pros
pective output. Contracts also
have been begun for early 1917
and negotiations are on which
will extend over all of next year.
Much of the domestic copper
will go into the manufacture of
munitions besides providing the
wants of regular manufacturers
of ordinary trade products. Oct
ober copper sold at 27 cents, the
highest price paid for several
months. November contracts
have been made at 26 cents.
Inquires have come into the
market from American manu
facturers for copper to be de
livered througn next February,
and the price has advanced from
the 25c level of a few days ago.
More activity than usual is
noticed about the streets of Pa
tagonia this week, as a result of
increasing ore shipments from
this station. One morning this
week, before 8 o'clock, 37 vi
hlcles were counted on the
streets, including big freight
outfits, automobile, trucks and
rigs of all kinds. TheDuquesne
Mining and Reduction company
has shipped 31 cars of ore and
concentrates from Patagonia
this month, the Three R is ship
ping about 35 tons per day; the
Mowry is also having ore hauled
to the platform in Patagonia for
shipment, and four or five small
er shippers add to the general
activity. Only a few weeks ago
a new ore platform, 200x50 feet,
was built in Patagonia, in addi
tion to the two smaller ore dumps
already here. This week rail
road officials are figuring on put
ting in another platform, prob
ably larger than all three, to
accommodate ore shippers.
REAL AMERICANS.
Idaho Guardsmen Do Not Whine and
Cry.
The Second Idaho Infantry
camped here last Monday after
noon and night on their return
from Fort Huachuca to Nogales,
says the Santa Cruz Patagonian.
The Idaho boys made the hike
from Nogales to Huachuca in
six days without any men drop
ping out on account of exhaus
tion and only one man was ill,
he haviner been taken ill with a
fever. The Second Idaho In
fantry is made up of men from
every walk in life according to
Corporal John M. Bradley of
Company K who paid this office
a visit during the regiment's stay
here. The corporal himself is a
newspaper man of more than 35
years experience and when at
his home in Buhl, Idaho, is sec
retary of the Buhl Commercial
Club. "Our regiment," said
Corporal Bradley, "can furnish
a detail in almost any profession
from a counter jumper to a law
yer. A recent roll call of the re
giment showed that every de
partment of railroad work is re
presented. There are lawers,
merchants and bankers; tailors,
butchers and bakers; printers,
plumbers and painters; we have
surveyors, farmers, cow men and
miners. And we are not down
here merely for a vacation. We
left our homes and our business
and came down here because we
believed that we were needed and
we are ready to render that
service at any time and any
place. We are immensely pleas
ed with what we have seen of
Arizona and will never forget
our two camps in - Patagonia.
We are also deeply grateful to
the ladies of Tucson for the
royal reception tendered us
when we passed through there en
route to Nogales. I am sure we
will all go home with many last
ing and pleasant memories of
Arizona."
MINING ENGINEERS COMING.
Prominent mining and metal
lurgical circles have for almost
half a century participated in
the work of the American Insti
tute of Mining Engineers, which
on the 18th of September will
open a week's session in the
various fields of Arizona. A
study of the work of some of the
present officers of the institute
most of whom will attend the
Arizona meeting, reveals some
what the strength of the mem
bership of the institute.
L. D. Rickitts. consulting en
gineer, has served as president
of the institute since last Feb
ruary. He succeeded William L.
Saunders, chairman of the board
of Ingersoll & Rand Co. and
.vice chairman of the Navel Con
sulting Board. Mr. Saunders
has invented apparatus for drill
ing rock under water, pumping
by compressed air, Ingersoll
track and bar channelers and
gadders for quarrying stone.
Benjamin B. Thayer, president
of the Anaconda Copper Com
pany, is a former president of
the institute. Mr. Thayer is
thoroughly familiar with mining
operations in many parts of the
world, and in addition to dis
playing great technical skill has
infused into his company a loyal
ty and efficiency that are excep
tional. He will accompany the
New York special train in his
private car.
Sidney J. Jennings, first vice
president of the institute, is
vice president of U. S. Smelting,
Refining and Mining Co. and
has charge of their exploration
department. He has had long
experience in South African min
ing and was president of the
South African Association of En
gineers. George C. Stone, the
institute's treasurer, is chief en
gineer of the New Jersey Zinc
Company.
Bradley Stoughton, secretary
of the institute for the past three
years is a consulting metallur
gist in New York City, and is
the inventor of a converter for
making steel castings and a pro
cess for oil melting in cupolas.
He is the author of the widely
known text book. "The Metal
lurgyof Iron and Steel." Among
I the vice-presidents of the insti
j tute are H. C. Hoover, now
i known throughout the world as
chairman of the Commission for
Relief in Belgium, and Karl
Eilers metallurgist and special
ist in smelting lead and copper.
Among the directors of the
Institute are Reginald W. Brook,
director of the Canadian Geolo
gical Survey and lately of the
Canadian Expeditionary Force,
and D. C. Jackling, who is iden
tified with many of the country's
leading copper mining compa
nies. Blade Tribune.
A SCORE OF BELLIGERENTS.
Roumania was the fifteeth na
tion to enter the war. The roll
of belligerents now includes Ger
many, Austria-Hungary, Russia,
France, Great Britain, Italy, Ja
pan, Belgium, Serbia, Bulgaria,
Turkey, Roumania, Portugal,
Montenegro and San Marino.
With the last of these nations,
which is safly located on a hill
top completly surrounded by
Italy, historians of the war may
be little concerned. But every
one of the others lias played, is
playing or will play an import
ant part in the game.
Even Portugal, whose belated
declaration of war against Ger
many was taken as a joke by
many readers, is not to be dis
regarded merely because she
has sent no troops to the Euro
pean front. Portugal has been
very busy in Africa, protecting
her colonies and helping to ex
pel the Germans. Future his
torians may attach vastly more
importance than we do now to
the lonely little campaigns being
waged in African jungles for the
possession of a great continent
with limitless possibilities of de
velopments. The number of nations is real
ly larger than the list indicates.
The British Empire is merely a
convenient collective term. Ca
nada, Australia, South Africa
and New Zealand, all selfgov
ing countries, might logically
be regarded as so many different
belligerents. And Persia, too,
fighting against Russia although
nominally at peace, is really a
belligerent. There are about
twenty countries actually engag
ed in the war. Star.
Democrats Lead In Registration.
One week before the close of
registration the office of secre
tary of the state showed a total
registration of 61,000 names. Of
these 40,000 are democrats and
20,000 republicans. Having no
exciting contest in the republi
can party, many have been guil
ty of moral perjury by register
ing as democrats to participate
in the gubernatorial contest. It
is probable the registration
which closes September 2, will
show a total of over 70,000.
There are few prohibitionists or
socialists registered. Two years
ago' record was 55,000 for prim
aries and 70,000 in general elec
tion. Probably 85,000 will not
be a bad guess for total registra
tion for general election in No
vember. The face of the returns
should not be taken as conclus
ive that democrats have a walk
over as in Maricopa county, es
pecially, the republicans are
preparing to make a strong fight.
It is the same in every other
county in the state. Messenger.
HER TURN.
"John, dear, you're not going
out tonight, are you?"
"Why er I kind of half pro
mised the boys I'd drop around
for a game of Kelly pool."
"Oh, John, I wish you wouldn't
It's dreadfully lonesome here
when you're out."
"Why, lovey. I had no idea
you missed me as much as that."
"I do, John. Of course I don't
want to deprive you of your
pleasures, but I do wish you'd
stay at home more than you do."
"Very well, dear. If you feel
that way about it. I'll stay home
tonight."
"JohD, you're just the best
hubby in the world. Would you
mind taking care of baby while
I run around to the moving pict
ure show ?"
