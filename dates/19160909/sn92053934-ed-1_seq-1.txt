OF SENATORS
IN SPEECHES
Vice President Marshall
Peels Hide Off Critics
of Wilson.
HUGHES WEAK SISTER
Difficult Task for Candidate
to Please Both Roosevelt
and Barnes in Oratory.
Winchester, Kjr., Sept. 9. Re
publican criticism of the Wilson
administration was reviewed by
lice President .Marshall in a
speech here today, with the con
clusions that the main reason of
fered the country for turn In sr out
the democrats was the desire of
the republicans to get In, and that
former Justice Hughes campaign
speeches were bnt echoes of often
heard partisan orations in the sen
ate. "Not only the keen-eyed newspaper
man, but the every-day citizen," Mr.
Marshall said, "is wondering what is
the matter with the speeches of the
leader In the verbal assault against
the administration.
"Just now, chief interest in the re
publican candidate for president con
sists in ascertaining whether he be
longs to the progressive face or the
Btandpat neck of his party.
"Manifestly, it is a difficult task to
talk in tones sufficiently vacuo and
uncertain to please both Roosevelt
and Barnes, both Penrose and LaFol
lette. The candidate is really to be
more commiserated than criticized.
"For three years and more it has
been my fortune or misfortune to
hear the speeches made in the senate.
The republican candidate is now re
peating thes speeches in abbreviated
form from the stump.
"When the candidate announced the
Infallibility of the protective tariff, I
recognized the oft-expressed views of
Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire.
When he declared that we were dwell
ing in a fool's paradise, I heard an
ecbo of the voice of Reed Smoot of
Utah. When he talked about Mexico,
I could shut my eyes and see before
me the figure of Senator Fall. When
he condemned 'pork' in connection
with the rivers and harbors bill, I
tasted again in homeopathic doses the
Bpeeches, weary hours long, of for
mer Senator Burton of Ohio. And
when the candidate assaulted the civil
service record of the administration.
I realized that he had heard from that
political purist, Boise Penrose of
Pennsylvania.
"But in the speeches I have found
nothing that ever fell from the lips
of such senators as Cummins, Kenyon,
LaFollette, Clapp, Xorris or Gronna.
The candidates' inspiration springs
from the speeches of Penrose, Gallin
ger, Smoot, Fall senators of the
standpat wing of the party.
Voter Iust Make Choice.
"The voer must decide whether he
wants to turn all the important com
mittees of the senate over to men who
were brought, up in the Aldrich school
of statesmanship and are wedded to
its policies.
"Up to this time, reasons why dem
ocrats should be put out of power aro
left to the imagination. The main rea
son seems to be that the republicans
Just want, control again. The country
is satisfied with trade conditions and
with business, which is unprecedent
edly large; the people are satisfied
with the record of achievements, which
includes more remedial legislation
than was ever written by any two
administrations; our opponents fall to
Promise anything in the way of repeal
or substitutes.
"For purely partisan purposes the
republican orators are proclaiming
that the president is an infirm Amer
ican and that Americanism and repub
licanism are synonymous. But the
People at large realize that American
citizenship is made up of only two
trades of citizens. Citizen of the first

CRUISER FAR
UPON REEFS
Wreck of War Ship Memphis
Is Due to a Giant
Tidal Wave.
BOILERS HAD FAILED
Water Lifts Great Ship On
Its Crest and Dashes
Her on Rocks.
Washington, Sept. 9. Full details
of the recent wreck of the armored
cruiser Memphis in Santo Domingo
harbor just reecived at the navy de
partment from Rear Admiral Pond,
show that two of the cruiser's boilers
burst before she was thrown upon the
rocks by the tidal wave.
Earlier reports had indicated that
breaking of a steam pipe crippled the
ship.
Of the forty men who lost their
lives in the wreck, 26 were on board
a launch swamped while returning
from shore with the ship's baseball
team. Five other men were drowned
in a launch lowered after the explo
sion. Xew York, Sept. 9. Vivid descrip
tions of the marine phenomen which
caused the destruction of the United
States armored cruiser Memphis in
the harbor of Santo Domingo on Aug.
29, were given today by witnesses of
the disaster who had arrived on the
steamer Iroquois. The conjecture
that the disaster was the result of an
undersea eruption was strengthened
by assertions that nothing resembling
a gale accompanied the sudden dis
turbance. Strange Phenomenon.
The theory that tho big seas which
tossed the 15,000 ton warship on the
rocks were caused by an undersea
shock transmitted from a disturbance
on the preceding day at Dominica,
British West Indies, was advanced by
Captain Theodore De Booy of the
American Indian Ileye foundation, an
eye witness. This theory, said Cap
tain De Booy, Is borne out by the fact
that Dominica lies east-southeast of
Santo Domingo and the seas threw
the Memphis in a west-northwesterly
direction ashore.
"The strange phenomena," he said,
"was absolutely new to the experience
of all who beheld it. It had been
blowing a hurricane from the south
east for two days, but on the morning
of August 29 the sea was calm and
there was no wind. Then the sea be
came suddenly turbulent. '
"As the fury of the marine disturb
ance increased, the Memphis was seen
to be dragging her anchor and gradu
ally being driven ashore. Finally a
wave lifted up the warship, held her
on its summit for a moment and then
dashed her down on a submerged reef
within 200 yards of dry land. Im
mense waves continued to break over
her and the Memphis was shoved
ashore until she was only fifty yards
away. An improvised breaches buoy
was put in operation and the men
were brought ashore, some terribly
burned from explosion of her boil
ers." STAMP TAX REPEAL
