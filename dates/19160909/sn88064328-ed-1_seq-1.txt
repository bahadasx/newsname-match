he would require the absolute sat

that he wanted it understood that

promised that it would then be
only an act of grace on the part of'
the sovereign State and not as
something wrested from the sov

Governor's firm stand greatly en
couraged the producers of sugar
who are fighting to exact a wpiare

O. N ouiiir, Eugene A. I harr,
LeBourgcots, D. W. Pipes,
and E. F. Dickinson was apj
ed to make a counter propo>
to Mr. Hast.
This committee notified Babst
of the refusal to compromise as
per his proposal and asked him
to make a flat offer for whatever
I.
•fr.,
int
at all that his company wants to
purchase 1!>16 Louisiana sugars,
Thev " ,so suggested the writ
ing of a letter to cane growers
throughout the State telling them
that henceforth settlement for
portion of the U'Hi Louisiana
sugar crop his company wanted
to purchase. There is no doubt
„4 ..11 «I...« I,;.. ..nuiiüiiiv uiiiik In
. ■ ,
that henceforth settlement for
sugar cane purchases ought to be
made in pounds of sugar and not
the cash equivalent value, ot the.
pounds of sugar prodifced.
This is done to destroy the mis
apprehensions which the cane
growers have that some of the
sugar factories are to them like
sugar lactones are to neni
the Trust is to the sugar mam
facturers These m.sappfeheft
Sions are thought to be due to
facturers. These 1 misapprehefl,
sions are thought to be due to the
fact that almost all the cane
contracts are made upon the basis
'of yellow clarified values, eaehl
ton of caaic being paid for m cash
instead of sugar. Working this
wa v the most prominent ment of
the industry believe, the cane
buyer would then no longer want
to see low sugar prices if such be
the case anywhere to-day.
It has been charged by cane
growers that some big cane buy
ers make refining sugar and are
glad to see low prices for their
buying standards, yellow clari
fled. Payment of the cane grow
cr in pounds of sugar would pre
vent sueh io v on the part of these
big can e buyers, and the cane
grower could hold or sell his
sugar the same'way that the man
ufacturers can hold or sell.
The adoption of the pounds of
'sugar payment method will put
the grower and the manufacturer
in the same boat. And a stren

If the community is progres

We know that many people like

of the imagination. Nine out of
every ten of us are too busy
with our own affairs to take time
to attend to the details of com

Old age comes quick enough
without inviting it. Some look
old at forty. That is because
they neglect the liver and bowels.

LOUISIANA ASSESSMENT.
The Louisiana assessment con
tinues to advance by driblets. It
j g I10VV thought that it may reach
lead--1$600,000,000 f or t hc year. The
p r0 g r ess upward is slow. A few
miJlions havc |)feen {j(kl(>d by t|)(1
parish assessors after they had
completed their rolls, from prop

though Louisiana boasts of more
people, and considerably less than
that of Connecticut. Oregon, West
Virginia and Washington. all
smaller in population. It can be
safely said, therefore, that Lou
isiana property is not excessively
assessed; the trouble has been
that it is unequally assessed—
high in some sections and absurd
ly low in others.
Prom the last census estimate
of the absolute wealth of the
country, the total value of all
nroperty in Louisiana today is
probably close to two billions, so
that the assessment is barely on a
thirty per cent basis. Governor
Hlanchard. ten ve irs ago. thought
that the asseasment ought, upon
a fair allowance, to be $800 000,

average of fifty per cent. On

Justice Hughes says: I would
not shrink from war. Emperor
William of Germany would not
either and did not. The Czar of
Ifussia refused to shrink from it.
I lie powers behind King (b orge
of England didn't shrink from it.
France didn't. Serbia didn't;

•Justice uuhes, and repeat your
statement upon every platform in
this country if you desire to get
no votes at all. The American
people shrink from war, and al
ways have. Thev stand aghast
at the prospect of it. The fewr
times they have entered war they
did so with solemn hearts, shrink

far as possible before entering it..
