of staff of Emperor Nicholas II's
armies, told the United Press today.
"Furthermore, German troops must

General Alexieff received me in a
small, plainly furnished office adjoin

Nicholas. A flat top desk, a few
chairs and maps were the only furn
ishings. The general sat behind the
desk like an Ameriqpn business man.

combined offensive against Russia.
"Despite the encircling ring of the

they are exerting on all sides, I would
hesitate to say that such an offens

biggest mistake a general can make
Is to underestimate the enemy.

would be for us to beat. I am most

"I will not say that the Austrian

GERMAN MORALE GONE
Enters Third and Final Stage Now,
With French Steadily Winning
Back Thelp Lost
Positions.
[By Henry Wood, United Press Staff
Correspondent]
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY AT
VERDUN, Sept. 9.—The Germans
are now entirely on the defensive at
Verdun.
The great battle begun 201 days
ago, has now entered Its third and
final stage. The French are steadily
winning back their lost positions.
The battle will gradually die ont like
an extinct volcano.
It has now been leartaed definitely
that the Germans were forced to re
move huge quantities of artillery and
men from Verdun to the Somme front
three weeks ago to meet the new An
glo-French offensive. This has an
immediate effect upon the morale of
the remaining men. In February they
had been told they were to capture
Verdun. At the end of July they
were told it would bo sufficient to
simply dominate the situation there.
But when th6y had been reduced in
numbers to merely a defensive gar
rison, after nearly seven months of
lighting, their morale was so shat
tered that groups of prisoners have
been snrrende^ing. aame of them-go-,
,lng through Verdun singing the Mar^'
seillaise, French of&cers declare.
The seventh and last great German
massed attack was made on both
banks of the Meuse on July 10. The
French checked this blow immediate
ly and took the offensive. Ever Bince
that time they have retained the In
itiative, capturing in their operap
tlons more than ten thousand prison
ers, a score of cannon and a hundred
machine guns.
Fighting on the west bank of the
Meuse has practically ceased. Hill
304 and Dead Man's hill are now num
bered among the glories of the past.
East of the river, the Germans are
concentrating for a final, desperate
struggle to retain the forts of Vaux
and Daumont. Even on this sector
their resistance has been Immeasur
ably weakened. This fact I was able
to ascerfain personally Thursday and
Friday when the German bombard
ment let loose as a prelude to the at
tempt to recapture trenches captured
by the French in the Vaux Cnapitre
and Chenols woods on Wednesday.
This cannonading was incomparable
to the terrific fire from the German
guns that marked the early fighting
around Verdun.
