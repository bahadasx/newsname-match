PARALYSIS CASE

Being Guarded By Two
Officers
The first case of Infantile paralysis
i in Fairmont was reported today and
> while the case is thought to be a light *
J one a strict quarantine is being en- o
forced. The case was first susplcfoned
by Dr. Wm. F. Boyers and Dr. J. W. e
McDonald, who immediately called .
. the city physician, Dr. C. M. Ramage. *
in consultation. The diagnosis of in- J
fantile paralysis was confirmed and P
* steps were immediately taken to pre,
vent any possible spread of tho con[
tagion.
The three year old daughter of John '
Holt, on Newton street, near Diamond ?
' on the East Side is the child that now
has this disease and it is thought to
have been carried by a visiting wo- j
' man who come here from McKees- "
port. Pa., some three weeks ago. ?
1 Two officers are now guarding the J;
residence and are present both day ?
and night. The attending physicians "
stated today that no known exposure *
to this case had occurred and that ?
since tho case was a mild one the pubI
lie need not fear a general outbreak
of the epidemic.
The attending doctors were carerul
to immediately fumigate their cloth- ?
ing and disinfect themselves after
leaving this residence and every precaution
is being taken to prevent the r
possibility of transmission. The pre- s
cautionary measures adopted early v
this week by the Board of Health >'
have in a great measure relieved the
apprehension of this disease from the 0
public and the Board is now prepared P
to thoroughly enforce all of the pre- ti
ventive regulations that have been c
adopted iri the Eastern cities where fa
the present epidemic originated. The d
rapid approach' of cold weather has n
made the recent case much less so- ti
vero and in a short time the llkeli- v
hood of transmission of this disease ti
will be negligible.

and Irish peasants, the United
- States has had no
AMERICA CAN! Iinen industry.
AMERICA CAN! But Amorlcail
B commercial genius,
out of respect to
sensitive olfactory
organs, has solved
the problem in another
day ? and
THERE IS GOING
TO BE an American
linen Industry! j
Linen is made:
from flax, which:
the botanists call
an "Inner-bark" fiber
plant. Between
the outer skin on
the stem and the
woody inner pith is
found the commercially
useful .flax
fiber.
Before this Is ready Air the mm, the
slants must not only b?i. harvested,
be seed removed and the straw dried,
but a process known as "retting,"
which Is a.polite way of saying 'Toting,"
must take place.
In Europe the flax farmer rets his
slants by putting bundles of flax straw
in end in pools dug to the correct
lepth, and keeping them covered with
water from seven to ten days. In Ireand,
where this method 1b much used,
the stench from these retting pools
lovers the country for miles around.
When the process is complete, the
men must wade waist deep in these
'etid pools and lift out the slimy mass
>f straw.
American farmers won't do this kind
if work. So flax In the United States
Is raised almost wholly for flaxseed,
>r linseed oil.
But now American genius has decid;d
to overcome the difficulty, by devising
methods of rotting the stalks by
ihemical processes.
This has been tried many times in
Europe, but without success. Now,
nowever, at least two companies In
:he United States have perfected a
:hemlcal process which works. The
Northern Flax Fiber Co. of Great Falls,
Mont., Is one. and the United States
Jnen Co. of Seloit. Wis., another.
These companies are making conracts
with farmers to grow fiber-bearng
flax at a guaranteed income to the
'armer of $16 an acre.
The European warhas greatly curailed
the available supply of flax fiber
'rom abroad. The United States in
lormal years imports between 10,000
ind 12,000 tons of this material, valued
it between $3,000,040 and $4,000,000.
The United States department of ag lculture,
estimates that 60,000 acres
>f farm land would be necessary for
-aislng the 10,000 tons of raw flax a
'ear at present used in this country.
In addition, to supply enough flax
:o manufacture in the United States
>ur present Imports of linen from
ibroad, would require about 400,000
Lcres more devoted to fiber raising.
The United States is the world's
argest user of Uren goods, and except
'or inslgniflcan. amounts of crash
owellng, the entire supply has been
mported from abroad.
The imports of linen goods in 1916
otalled $14,716,043 in value. Tbe nornal
imports run up to $28,000,000. A
lew $28,000,000 American Industry,
herefore, is one resnlt which may
:ome from the European war. It is
mother proof that "AMERICA CAN"

SQUIRREL HUNTERS
REM HON
643 Have Obtained "Heck"
Martin's Permission
To Shoot
Six hundred and forty-three county
resident hunters licensee have been
issued to date by County Clerk A. G.
Martin and the number of the army
that will be prepared to wage war on
the rabbits and squirrels this fall
will likely reach more than one thousand
by the fifteenth of this month.
The squirrel season is the first to
open and hunters who have been
granted these licenses may lawfully
kill gray squirrels on or after September
16. The rabbit season does
not open until November 16.
In addition to the 643 Marlon county
nimrods who have registered with
the clerk, 33 licenses to hunt throughout
the state 1-ve been granted by
Mr. Martin. These state licenses
cost the applicant $3 each and this
may be one of the reasons that this
number is smaller than the number
of county licenses. The county licenses
have no fee attached and each
day scores of applicants besiege the
county clerk's office, many of whom
will not likely do any hunting at
all.
The bright red tag which was Issued
with these licenses last season
and required to be exhibited conspiciously
Is not being used this year
and the license now consists of two
small slips of paper similar to a
check or receipt form. These are
to be separated and the shorter stub
displayed conspiciously on the clothing
of the hunter.
"Heck' Martin and assistant clerk
Ed. Phillips have cheerfully handed
cut the licenses although considerably
rushed at times by the press of
business. With each license they
hand out a smile and a good word*
for the deserving democrats who are
candidates this fall.
