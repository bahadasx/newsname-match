Wheat Supply Will Folk
Below the Amount Needed
For Home Consumption
Washington, Sept. 8—Heavy dam­
age to the country's cereal crops dur­
ing August caused a loss of many
millions of bushels in prospective pro­
duction, cutting down the outlook for
wheat to below the amount required
for home consumption.
The department of agriculture's
monthly forecast, issued today, esti­
mates the wheat crop at (51 1,000,000
bushels, or 9,000,000 bushels less than
is calculated to be necessary for do­
mestic use. A carry-over of approxi­
mately 160,000,000 bushels of old
wheat from last year's record break­
ing crop will make up the deficiency
and leave something like 100,000,000
bushels available to supply the heavy
demands of foreign nations for wheat.
Spring wheat, parched by hot and
dry weather, showed a loss of 43,000,

cast of production,, while corn esti­
mates were 67,000,000 bushels smaller
than forecast a month ago.
A preliminary estimate of the win
ter wheat crop places the production
at 455,000,000 bushels, and that of
spring wheat at 156,000,000 bushels.
The prospective spring wheat crop is
the smallest in 22 years and 200,000,
000 bushels less than harvested last
year. The total wheat crop is placed
at 611,000,000 bushels, which is 400,
000,000 bushels less than last year's
record breaking crop of 1,012,000,00

BIG FIGHT ON III
STREETCAR SUE
Officials Threaten to Use Strike­
breakers to Continue Car
Service.
New York, Sept. 8.—The second
day of the strike of unionized em­
ployes of New York's subway and ele­
vated lines brought little interference
to service, but developsd a conte:',
which, it was said, may decide wheth­
er the city's carmen will be permitted
to organize.
Theodore Shonts, president of the
Interborough Rapid Transit company,
and the New York Railways company,
struck at the union by offering to take
back all striking New York Railways
company employes, (surface car mot
ormen and conductors) who quit the
union by tomorrow. Strike breakers,
he declared, would be put in the
places of all employes who do not ac­
cept his offer.
Union leaders threatened tonight to
extend the strike to the Third Avenue
line, the Second Avenue line and the
Union Railways company, unless the
heads of these lines pledge themselves
not to circulate individual contracts
among their men similar to those
binding the workers not to ask for
wage increases for two years, which
brought on the Interborough strike
and the sympathetic New York Rail­
ways strike. The Third Avenue line,
it was said, refused the demand.

Cedar Rapi^jB0tTsept, 8.—A deci­
sion which, iii^fhe opinion of promi­

lish the authority of ithe interstate
commerce commission to overrule the
rates set by the states for intra-state
business, was handed down here to­
day in the federal district court, in
the so-called South Dakota rate case.
Overrules Petition.
The decision overrules the petition
of South Dakota shippers for an in­
junction to restrain express compan­
ies doing business in the state from
increasing their tariffs to conform
with the uniform rates fixed by the
interstate commerce commission.
The interstate commerce commis­
sion also was made a defendant in
the judgment. Judge W. I. Smith of
the United States district court of ap­
peals and Judge Martin J. Wade of
the Iowa federal district court sign­
ed the decision. Judge Henry T. Reed
of the federal district court, North­
ern District of Iowa, dissented.
Arguments for the defense., which
^geje approved hy.thqujgjpcisira of the
court held that the 'question to be
decided was whether the interstate
coMmerce commission was superior
in power to the general assembly of
the state in regulation of a corpora­
tion engaged in interstate business,
for business which originates and ter­
minates wholly within the state,
whose laws were called in question
by the rates fixed by the interstate
commerce commission.
ENGLAND TO
Not Likely to Change in Any
Respect Her Blacklist
Policy.
London, Sept. 8.—"It is not likely
that Great Britain will change her
black list policy at the request of the
United States," said Lord Robert Ce­
cil, minister of war trade, in discus­
sing the possible effect of recent
American retaliatory legislation. To
the Associated Press, Lord Robert
stated that a reply to the blacklist pro­
test made by the United States may
be expected soon.
Lord Robert, however, declined to
enter into the details of the contents
of the reply beyond the statemen*
that the principle embodied in British
legislation forbidding trading with an
enemy country is unlikely to be sur­
rendered in any measure.
The minister of war trade profess­
ed himself to be puzzled by the pro­
visions in the revenue bill passed by
congress at Washington, dealing with
the prohibition of imports, as such or­
ders, he said, were adopted strictly in
an effort to conserve tonnage and
were applied accordingly.

The plans of this association involve
the erection of a strictly modern hos­

in the meantime a temporary frame

NOW RAGING ROUMANIA
Terrific Struggle Is Now Taking
Place on Front From Black
Sea to Danube.
RUSSIANS CONTINUE
THEIR OFFENSIVE
Heavy Bombardments Mark the
Fighting on the Somme Front
in France.
London, Sept. 8.—Roumania, which
entered the European war less than
two weeks ago, is the scene of a great
battle between Russo-Roumanian forc­
es and armies of the central powers.
The southern part of Dobrudja, or
eastern Roumania, has become a fight­
ing ground, and the opposing armies
are engaged from the Black sea *o the
Danube, along a front of about 70
miles.
The Bulgarian and Turkish troops,
advancing along the Black sea coast,
have occupied Baltjik and two other
seaports, Sofia reports, and the fort­
ress' of Dobritch, or Bazprdjik. 50
miles southeast of Bucharest, haa
been taken by a combined Buigar-Ger
man force. The armies of the central
powers have not yet crossed the Dan­
ube, all reports agree.
The Roumanians continue their of­
fensive in eastern Transylvania and
have also occupied the important vil­
lage of Orsova, on the Danube, above
the Iron Gates. Advancing from Scig
Szereda, in Transylvania, north of
Kronstadtj the Roumanians ars driv­
ing westward and Vienna admits the
withdrawal of Austrian forces before
attacks against Hargitta.
Russians Cross Dvina.
The Russians on the northern end
of their line near Riga have commenc­
ed a new undertaking, and have cross­
ed the Dvina, norfh of Dvinsk. Re­
peated efforts by the Germans to dis­
lodge them, Petrograd declares, have
been unsuccessful.
In eastern Galicia, the Austro-Ger
mans are fighting desperately to hold
back the Russians advancing on Hav
liz, southeast of Lemberg. Petrograd
says the Austro-German forces have
fallen back to the western bank of
the Gnita Lipa, while Vienna asserts
the troops of the central powers are
holding their own in the heavy fight­
ing. Russian attacks against German
positions on the Zlota Lipa, southeast
of Brzezany, failed with heavy losses,
Berlin reports.
Bombardments Near Somme.
On the Somme front, in France, the
violent bombardment continues along
almost the entire line. The only in­
fantry engagements have taken place
south of the river. The French re­
port a further advance for their
troops in the village of Vermandovil
lers. In the Berny-en-Senterre and
Chaulnes sector, where the fighting
was particularly vicious, both the Ger­
mans and the French claim successes
for their armies in the repulse of at­
tacks.
There has been no infantry action
on the front in Greek-Macedonia, but
the artillery duels have continued
along the Struma and in the region of
Lake Doiran.

El Paso, Sept. 8.—Numerous rumors

that United States troops had engaged

The rumors were attributed to an
