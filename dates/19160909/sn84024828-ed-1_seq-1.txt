ARIZONA - BUTTE
COMPANY'S MILL
IS IN OPERATION
From Wednesday! Dally Minerl
J. E. Leeper and Don N. Stewart
went out to Stockton Hill Sunday to
look over the Arizona Butte Mines
company's new mill and witness the
first work of the plant. The mill has
been placed in commission and is be
ing tried out on a fine grade of ore.
It will handle about 200 tons of ore
daily, but its capacity will not be
reached for some time.
A few days ago 'the mine and mill
were visited by I. M. George, Vin-
cent Fortune and Anson H. Smith.
They found the plant almost ready
for work, the various sections being
tried out. In the bunkers at the mill
were many tons of fine lead-zinc ore.
This ore was said to have values of
better than 40 per cent in combined
lead-zinc content. It also carried
about $10 in gold and 6 to 8 ounces
in silver. Ten stopes of ore had been
opened on thejtunnel level of the Ban
ner mine and from this level thou
sands of tons of splendid milling ore
is being taken. Aside from the mine
ore there are many thousands of tons
in the dumps.
'S FIRST LEASE
WORKING PLACER DIRT
(From Oatraan Section Daily Miner.)
The first lease in the camp has
.started operations. It is on the War
ner group and is a placer proposition.
'The leasers nave strucK good pay
gravel aiready in three gulches and
are taking out money that represents
considerably more than wages, and as
.et they are not prepared to work
systematically.
Good pay has been found in the old
workings of the property. The first
and second small gulches" to the south
likewise have been prospected and pay
of the same character has been found
there.
Having succeeded so well the leas
ers are now engaged in trying for
.water, with which to rock their dirt
and obviate the difficulty of dry
washing. That difficulty is in separat
ing the gold from the large amount
of iron associated with it. They are
sinking a shaft for water on the
claims of the company and with that
found or not they will proceed to take
out and extract the gold from their
pay dirt. The leasers are Jack
Campbell, Joe Spencer and Mr. Power.

FROM COAST CITY
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
A. C Werden has returned to Gold
road after.three weeks at San Fran
cisco on business connected with the
,Gold Ore and the Moss properties,
He has a mill project for the former.
Several of them have been considered
in part, but the exact nature of the
present one has not been divulged.
' In regard to the Moss it is learned
from San Francisco sources that two
engineers will be here during the next
Week to examine the property and, if
reports are verified, there will be
something important to announce
with reference to it. It is known
that the reports given are most con
servative, hence there seems no rea-
son for an expression of doubt as. to
the outcome.
LOSES HIS CAR
From Saturday'! Daily Minerl
Frank Stitzer, on his way to King
man from Oatman yesterday in his
car, was caught in the heavy rain
storm. In attempting to cross the 13'
mile wash which was filled with water
his car narrowly escaped being
wrecked. The bank was washed away
on the east side and the car, unable
to pull up the grade, became stalled.
The water poured over the car and
washed away many articles in it.
After the water bad subsided another
automobile towed his car to town. It
was found that it was not badly da
maged beyond being filled with sand.
Several other autoists had -similar
experiences some of the cars being
shghtly damaged by boulders.
DRY WASHER WILL BE
USED IN YUMA COUNTY
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
The rich placer deposits of La Paz,
in Yuma county, are to be worked on
an extensive scale, in addition to the
operations now in progress there
through the agency of an invention,
a dry washing machine of an Oatman
man, Emil F. Busse, who has been
employed here for nearly two years
as a carpenter. For ten years he has
been perfecting his invention, for
which he has held a patent for seven
years.
REBEKAH LODGE WILL
GIVE GRAND BALL SOON
From Saturday'! Daily Miner
The Rebekah Lodge is to give a
grand ball September 20th. Commit
tees, have arranged to give the dance
and supper in the Elks' building and
have engaged the reception rooms of
the Odd Fellow' building, for card
playing and other amusements for
those who do not care to dance. The
committees are working hard to make
the affair a success and it is very
probable they will be well rewarded.
DAVIS GARRETT, MINER,
CROSSES GREAT DIVIDE
From Saturday'! Daily Miner
Davis Garrett died yesterday at
Gold Basin, where he had lived for
many years. He had been identified
with mining business his entire life.
He was a sufferer from cancer,
which was primarily the cause of his
death. His remains were taken to
Hackberry where interment will be
made today. The deceased was the
father of Mrs. W. L. Kayser of Hack
berry. SECURES ENGINE
The Arizona Butte Mines company
received yesterday the second 75
horsepower semi-Deisel engine ordered
from the Arizona Engineering com
pany. CUTS THROUGH STRINGER
The Arizona-Central shaft has cut
through the stringer that was exposed
'at 365 foot point recently. It showed
some values, but not large. Its width
was over six feet.
MRS. LATHRAP DEAD
Mrs. F. H. Lathrap, wife of the
manager of the Arizona" Brokerage
company, died a few days ago at Oak
land. Mr. Lathrap was at her bedside
but their two sons, Lloyd and Earl,
who were in Oatman, were notified
by wire.
ARIZONA CDPPERFIELDS, II.
HAS IIH PROMISING FUTURE
From Wedneaday Daily Miner
The approaching visit of the recent
ly appointed consulting engineer of
the Arizona Copperfields, Inc. a man
of international reputation to the
property of the corporation at Gross
Springs in the Cerbat range of moun
tains about 15 miles north of King
man, for examination purposes, is
fraught with the greatest importance
to the peopleof Mohave county, as a
whole, and particularly those of King
man, the supply point of the many
mining camps of northwestern
Arizona.
Being familiar with the holdings of
the Arizona Copperfields, Inc., the
writer has no hesitancy in predicting
that the report, which the engineer re
ferred to will make after a thorough
inspection and sampling, will be high
ly favorable. The property possesses
all the earmarks of a gigantic dissem
inated porphyry copper deposit. It is
practically certain that the examin
ing engineer will be so thoroughly con;
vinced of the merits of the holdings of
the company that he will recommend
its further development on a churn
drilling scale, followed by steam shov
els, the modus operandi of most of the
other big porphyry copper properties
of the West
It is known that at least two of the
big copper interests sought to acquire
control of the holdings now held by
the Arizona Copperfield, Inc., after
their engineers had made exhaustive
examinations and prepared reports
recommending its purchase in a man'
ner that left no doubt as to their sin
cere belief that with thorough devel
opment the property would develop
into one of the greatest disseminated
porphyry copper propositions thus far
discovered. The stock of the Arizona
Copperfields, Inc., is steadily advanc
ing on the New York curb and it is
not uirlikejy that it will reach the $10
mark in the not far distant future
The potentialities of the undevelop
ed acreage, as indicated by the par
tially-developed 16 acres, may readily
be appreciated by a comparison with
Utah Copper, the leader among the
porphyries.
Utah Copper has developed a total
of 390,000,000 tons of ore averaging
1.446 per cent copper on 226.3 acres.
This is 1,723,000 tons per acre.
If Arizona Copperfields' tonnage
persists to the same depth as that of
Utah Copper, the 16 acres alone have
possibilities of close to 28,000,000 tons,
without taking into consideration the
remaining 304 acres of the company's
territory.
If the ore on Arizona Copperfields'
entire acreage should persist to the
same depth as that on Utah Copper,
namely, 549 feet, it would make even
a greater mine than Utah Copper is
at the present time, on account of the
greater acreage.
The foregoing figures of the big
porphyries represent possibilities that
lie directly ahead of Arizona Copper
fields, which is only in its infancy.
These properties were not made in a
day and it is not expected that Ari
zona Copperfields will develop into a
phenomenal producer overnight, but
under active development it should
prove the equal of any of the great
porphyry producers.
Comparing the market value of the
issued capitalization of Arizona Cop
perfields, Jerome Verde, which is yet
a prospect, although it has every ex
pectation of turning into a big pro
ducer, is selling at a valuation of $7,
500,000, while Green Monster, also of
the Jerome camp and without any ore
as yet, is selling in the market at a
valuation of 2,700,000. Green Mon
ster and Jerome "Verde are highly
meritorious. But they have no dem
onstrated ore reserves on which to
base any valuation, and therefore they
can hardly be compared with an is
sue like Arizona, Copperfields. A new
campaign of development on big lines
is about to begin, and soon it should
be apparent that Arizona Copperfields
compares .with any of the big porphy
ries. The ore showing has been de
scribed by high authorities as "the
biggest discovery in the state of Ari
zona in years."
Arizona Copperfields, Inc., has been
in existence for only two months. The
company took over more than 89 per
cent of the capital stock of the Cop
perfield Porphyry Mining company,
owner of six mining claims in the
foothills of the Cerbat range in the
Wallapai mining district, Mohave
county, Arizona, and two miles from
the Chloride branch of the Santa Fe
railroad. It also purchased 13 addi
tional claims in close juxtaposition.
The two tracts of ground are of 120
acres and of 200 acres, respectively.
The company was able to acquire the
control of the Copperfield Porphyry
Mining company for the sole reason
that the controlling owners had reach
ed the end of their resources in de
veloping the property. Practically all
of the development work done to date
has been confined to 16 acres of the
120-acre tract.
It is a remarkable fact that with
little or no means and at the expense
of only a very small sum, which was
raised almost entirely locally, a tunnel
was driven, two shafts were put down,
and two drill holes, and thai with this
modest amount of exploration every
working was bottomed in ore and
reserve indicated of 2,500,000 tons of
ore, of 1.85 per cent copper, equivalent
to 37 pounds of copper per ton of ore.
Multiplying this by the possible
tonnage gives a total of 92,500,000
pounds of the red metal. On the basis
of the ordinary working cost and
15 cent copper metal market, this
would represent a net profit of $7,-
500,000, equivalent to $2.50 per share
on the entire 3,000,000 shares' of Ari
zona Copperfields outstanding. On a
25 cent copper market, such as has
been ruling for many months past,
the total profit in this tonnage of ore
would be increased to $15,750,000
equal to $5.25 per share on the com
pany's outstanding capitalization.
The company was organized for the
purpose of carrying out a compre-
hensive development program in order
to bring the property to the produc
tive" and dividend-paying stage.
The entire property will be divided
Into squares of 200 or-400 feet, and
drill holes will be put down at the
corners to whatever depth the ore
body persists.
The drilling operations will be
checked up by means of shafts and
crosscuts to verify the results, after
which the capping, or low-grade ma
terial, which covers the ore body for a
depth of from 2 to 50 feet, will be
stripped by means of steam shovels,
which will be used later in the actual
mining of the ore.
When developments have proceeded
to the proper point metallurgical tests
will be made to determine the type of
mill best adapted to the extraction of
the copper-bearing mineral from the
ore at the lowest cost. From prelimi
nary developments the indications are
that one of the well known flotation
processes which have been so success
ful at the Inspiration, the Miami, and
other big porphyry producers will be
adopted.
Arizona Copperfields enjoys a dis
tinct advantage over the other por
phyries in the early stages of their
development irf that it will have the
benefit of the advances that have been
made in the metallurgy of copper ores.
From this outline of the various
steps in the proposed development of
the Arizona Copperfields, which will
be similar to the method pursued in
the development of other porphyry
properties, it will be 'seen that it re
quires a long time to bring one of
these properties to the producing
stage. However, the market history
of all the big porphyry coppers is
alike, in that there is a gradual ad
vance in the price of'the issues as
mine development proceeds and the
properties approach the producing
stage.
The Rockefeller interests recognized
the value of the big porphyries when
the Anaconda Copper company, the
largest copper producer in the world,
acquired a big interest in the Inspira
tion Copper company. The Morgans
are heavily interested in Kennecott,
which in turn owns a big interest in
the Utah Copper company, the largest
porphyry copper producer in the world
and of which the Nevada Consoli
dated, another big porphry, is a sub
sidiary. It is no exaggeration to say
that the larger portion of the fortune
of the Guggenheims was made in Utah
Copper. True, the Guggenheims had
a great many millions before they un
dertook to finance Utah Copper, but
the returns from this investment have
probably several times exceeded their
former fortune. The names of D. C.
CRUDE OIL Ti
AT IOWA EXPLODES
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
An explosion of a tank of crude
oil occured yesterday during the noon
hour at the Iowa property. It created
an immense volume of smoke that
could be seen from Oatman and it
rose high above the surrounding
mountains. Outside of the loss of the
tank and several hundred gallons of
oil, no harm was done.
A driver of a truck-tanker went
there to siphon some more oil into
the tank. He sat down near by to
'eat his lunch when the top of the tank
blew off and flames went high into the
air. His escape unharmed was noth
ing short of miraculous. He had
.tank load intact on his truck which
he afterward took up to the shaft and
it was put into barrels, so that the
mine is not short of fuel and will not
have to shut down.
H. Burley, the superintendent, left
during the afternoon for Los Angeles.
NELLIE'S NEW PLANT
ONE OF LARGEST HERE
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.
When all of the units arrive and
are assembled, the Nellie mine will
have one of the most powerful and
most complete machanical plants in
the district.
A bUU-cuDic loot compressor was
shipped Tuesday from Chicago. It
will furnish the air for six drills.
A 100 horsepower engine to drive the
compressor and Cameron sinking
pump has been ordered and is on the
way. This is a result of a visit to
the coast of Manager H. E. Woods
and Superintendent D. F. Meiklejohn
from whence they have just returned,
There is now being installed a 200-
gallon per minute at 400 feet Cor
nish pump, and a 55- horsepower en
gine which will drive it. A 40- horse
power hoist is on the ground and
running.
This makes a total horsepower of
195 that the Nellie will have when all
the items are here. Mr. Woods states
that for the country, the amount of
water and the vast amount of work
his company will do, it is not too
much. With the placing of this ma
chinery the mine will work three
shifts and will be one of the big
operators of the district.
It is the nearest neighbor of the
Black Range and with both resuming
it will make the southern end of the
camp seem like old times.
WORK STARTED ON CLAIMS
OF WALLAPAI METALS
The Wallapai Metals company has
started development work on its
property about 14 miles east of King
man near the Telluride Chief and the
Enterprise mines. Walter Burkhart is
in charge of the work, which will in
clude the sinking of a shaft to a
depth of 200 feet. A hoist will be
installed at once.
The company has been financed by
the same interests identified with the
Leviathian Mines company, operating
in Deluge Wash.
NEW GOLDROAD HILL
ROAD NEARLY COMPLETED
The cut on the top of Goldroad hill
is almost completed and before many
days that part of the new road will
be in commission. At present a part
of the old road anda part of the
new are being used but it will not
be long before all of the new road
will be open for travel. Although
soft the road is now easily negotiated
in second gear by nearly all makes of
cars. The road when completed will
be one of the best pieces of work in
the county and will be a credit to the
men responsible for its construction.
W. G. Gruninger is building an ad
dition to one of the houses of L. J.
Lassell on Beale street.
J. B. Wright has completed a foun
dation on East Pine street to which
he is moving the old Methodist church
structure he recently bought.
Jackling, the Lewisohns, Seeley Mudd,
Hayden, Stone & Co., Phelps, Dodge &
Co., and numerous others who have
carved their fortunes out of porphyry
copper producers are well known to
the general public.
ON DUMP OF THE
Returning prospectors from the vi
cinity of the Mocking Bird mine yes
terday reported finding the body of a
young man lying on the dump of the
Good Day's property with a bullet hole
through the left eye. Coroner Lisle
rude hurriedly empaneled a jury and
departed for the scene of the tragedy.
Upon their arrival at the spot in
dicated they found the partially de
composed body of a man supposed to
be that of Frank McCoy, a well known
prospector of Nevada. The only evi
dence of the identity of the self-evident
suicide was a receipted bill from
a mercantile house in Nevada made
out in the name given. A revolver
was lying beside the body and it was
apparent to the jury that the. unfor
tunate man had taken his own life. A
verdict of suicide was rendered and
the body, owing to its condition, was
buried at the spot where it lay.
The only marks of identification was
the tattooed shield of the United
States on one arm with the word "Ma
nila" beneath, which was taken to in
dicate that the dead man had once
been in the government service either
as a sailor or soldier.
When the clothing on the body "was
searched $20 in money was found in
the pockets. The unfortunate man
was between 30 and 35 years old and
about 5 feet 9 inches tall. Several
old Nevada prospectors in Kingman
kno wMcCoy, but there are some who
believe that the body is that of Frank
McClure, who answers the description
and who was in the army at Manila.
IE CONTROL
PASSES TO M'NEALS
From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
Details of the transfer of control
of the Black Range company to E.
McNcal & Co., Chicago brokerage
firm, are en route from that city by
mail and should be here in a day or
two. It is learned from meager wire
information to Mitchell Carter, ma
nager of the Oatman Investment com
pany, that such deal has been made
and that D. P. Wright, former chief
owner and manager, is on a visit to
his old home in Tennessee, where he
will remain but a few days before re
turning. The property will start in a very
few days and add to the resumption
activities of the fall that are showing
on all sides.
GOLCONOA PLANT
READY FOR WORK
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.
During the past week, whirlwind
activity has prevailed at the Oatman
Golconda. The big plant is about
ready to turn over and the develop
ment and opening of another mine for
the Oatman section will soon be un
der way.
The installation ' of the machinery
by William Lorensen of San Francisco,
under supervision of Superintendent
D. F. Meiklejohn, is complete in every
respect. The equipment consists of a
100 horsepower engine, 600 cubic
foot compressor and large hoist.
Water is supplied from the company's
own pumping plant at the foot of
Golconda hill.
The veins of the Golconda pass
through the Pioneer, Boundary Cone
and Gold Dust, finally burying them
selves to the east in the Lexington
where an important strike was recent
ly made. Some very rich ore ha3
been extracted from the Golconda in
the past
WRIGHT COMING BACK
D. P. Wright, manager of the Black
Range, isen route home from Chicago
whither he went on a summons of E.
McNeal & Co., The results of his trip
are unknown here. It is known, how
ever, that he went in response to an
offer for the controlling interest in
the company and that he thought
enough of the offer to start thence
within a few hours after receiving it
by wire.
