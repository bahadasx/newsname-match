German forces Invading Rumania re
port that along the Black sea coast
an advance of fifty miles beyond the
frontier already has been made. They
express the opinion that the progress
of the invaders, who have occupied
several important positions on the
coast and elsewhere in Dobrudja, ex
plains the irresolution and compara
tive inactivity of the Rumanian forces
which, having invaded Transylvania,
now merely are sending out small
reconnoitering detachments. Not only
the Rumanians, but the Russians have
been defeated by the Bulgarians In
Dobrudja, the correspondents say,
thus destroying the legend that Bul
garians will not fight the Russians.
