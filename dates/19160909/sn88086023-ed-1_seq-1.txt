STANFIELD WINS
DISTRICT FIGHT
Slanfleld s petition for the annexa
tion of several sections of land from I
the Hermiston and Columbia school I
districts has been favorably passed !
upon by the county boundary board i
upon the condition that Stanfield dls-j
trlct assumes the pro rata of the
bonded Indebtedness against the other'
two districts.
The petition was vigorously oppos. I
ed by the Hermiston and Columbia
districts and there was much argu
ment on both sides The deciding,
factor was the preference of the fam-1
lilts In, the affected districts for tho
Stanfield district
One of the arguments against the
granting of the petition was that Her
miston and Columbia districts had
Incurred bonded Indebtedness and
that, to reduce those districts, would
Impose a greater burden upon the bal
ance of the district. As a matter of
equity, therefore, the board decided
that Stanfield district must assume
a proportionate part of the Indebted
ness. Tho boundary board consists of tho
members of the county court and
County Superintendent Young.
Discourtesy hurts the person who
uses It more thnn the porson toward
whom It is directed.
