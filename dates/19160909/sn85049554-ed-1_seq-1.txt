Carried on Crest of Hugs Wave and

Rescued by Improvised Breeches
Buoy,
New York, Sept 9.—Vivid descrip
tions of the marine phenomenon which
caused the destruction of the United
States armored cruiser Memphis, with
the loss of about forty of her crew, in
the harbor of Santo Domingo on Aug.
were given today by wltneaaes of
the disaster who had arrived In the
steamer Iroquois.
The conjecture that the disaster was
the result of a submarine eruption was
strengthened by a statement that noih
ng like a gale accompanied the dis
turbances. The rough sea which toaaed
the warship on the rocks was caused
by an undersea shock, according to
Capt. Theo DaBooy. of the American
Indian Heye foundation, an eye witness
of the catastrophe. This theory, said
Captain DeBooy, is borne In the faci
Dominica lies east-southeast of Santo
Domingo, and the seas threw the Mem
phis in a west-northwest direction
ashore.
A New Experience.

of all who beheld it, including the na
tives of the Island accustomed as they
ere to outbursts of tropical storms. It
had been blowing a hurricane from the
southeast for two days, but on ths
morning oi Aug. 2# the sea was calm
and there was no wind. Then the sea
suddenly became turbulent. The road
stead became an angry mass of foam
ing waves, in which no small craft
could live.
"As the fury of the disturbance. In

dragging her anohor and gradually be
ing driven ashore. Finally a great

the vessel down on a submerged reef
within 200 yards of dry land. Prom the
after ventilators of the cruiser was
pouring a cloud of steam. Immense
waves broke over her and the Memphis
was shoved ashore until she was only
fifty yards away. An improvised
breeches buoy was put in operation
and the men on the wrecked ship were
brought ashore.1'
