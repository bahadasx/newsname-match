Ills kingly crpwn Joggled right down oyer
his ear today, when 'Bob Gardner, defend;
lng-amateur tltleholder, In tho last' ditch,
was three down at ihe end of eighteen holes
to Chick Evans, open champion, In the
final round here Jor the United States ama
teur golf championship. Gardner, the
great, giant golfliall walloper, spread ha
mighty shoulders-and fought with all his
youthful courage, out he could not down
the diminutive enemy from his own home.
Conquering Cfilck Evans never showed such
superb match play In his veteran service
on his links. Ills notorious, miserable put
ting department 'was polished and shone
more and more as the enormous throng
frantically roared and cheered whenr hd

Fully lO.OOCf persons flooded the green
lawns of the Haverford links for the morn

tory has such a match been staged in the
Quaker City, and. seldom 'in American golf
annals has such a solid human field formed
avenues for the shot or packed and banked
Itself around the greens to see the putters
Jn action. Everywhere were movie cameras
and camera men. When the players took
the greens there was a snapping of lenses
almost like typewriters.
It was on the putting green that the
breaks of the morning began to come too
fast for Gardner, head-hunting Hinsdale
champion.

Features of Exercises at
Kensington High School
CORNERSTONE laying of Girls'
High School is cause for big
holiday in northeast section of city.
More than 20,000 marched in
big demonstrative pageant to cele
brate actual work on building.
Marks culmination of ten years'
work on part of citizens of Kensing
ton" ' " - "" ' iv
Prominent city, State and na
tional officials make addresses.
Predictions that Philadelphia will take
a wide leadership among cities In the edu
cation of children was mado today by
prominent speakers who addressed more
than 10,000 persons at the cornerstone lay
ing at tho new Kensington Illch School for
Girls, Cumberland and Amber streets. Tho
new building when completed will cost
$437,000. Before the cornerstone was laid
20,000 persons marched through tho heart
of Kensington.
The laying of the cornerstone began at
3 o'clock. A grand stand was erected
on the site of the new building. On It sat
Invited guests and speakers.
"The opening of a high school in Kensing
ton," said Dr. John P. Garber, superinten
dent jot public schools, "opens up a higher
opportunity than tho elementary schools
havo ufforded to the children who live In
that section. The new school will have a
large auditorium for community purposes.
In this auditorium pupils will have a chance
to get better acquainted with each other. By
meeting there they will also probably have
tho opportunity of visiting the homes of
pupil friends. Philadelphia Is taking an
Interest In educating her future cltttens.
More high schools will be erected and before
long I hope that this city will take a wide
leadership In educational work.'
Edward J. Cattell, city statistician, who
returned to this city from Newark, N. J.,
Where .last evening ho delivered three
speeches, was cheered when he was Intro
duced. "I hope," said Mr, Cattell, "that the
policy of developing educational campaigns
will be continued. Again this city has
proved that she takes anjnterest in helping
to educate the children of Its taxpayers. Be
fore long Philadelphia will become a'leader
In educational work."

NKW YORK, Sept. 9. Striking traction
employes who appeared to have been losers
In their, struggle with the Interbnrough
Rapid Transit Company, which controls the

ternational Longshoremen's Association,
announced that he had ordered members of
tho Tidewater Boatmen's Union not (0
handle coal barges roaded with fuel for the
power plants of the Interborough Company,'
This attempt to cut off tho fuel supply
necessary for the maintenance of the lines
which have been operating on a normal
pcalo despite the strike presented a serious
situation.
The company claims to have enough coal
for several days, but obedience to the order
fo.r a sympathetic strike by the longshore,
men would paralyzo the subway and ele
vated when tho present available fuel runs
out
The Central Federated Union, repre
senting approximately 750,000 men and
women of all trades, today appointed a'
committee with power to call a general sym
pathetic strike If men action is nects'ary

panies were bitterly assallod for their open
threat to destroy the Amalgamated Associa

u-ltk the active co-operation of United State
District Attorney Kane' office.
By HENRY JAMES BUXTON
In his nddress to the American Pharma
ceutlcal Association this week, Dr. Horatio
C. Wood, Jr., In descrlbtne the menacing
spread of the narcotlo drug erll tn this
city, emphasized tho fact that not only
the flotsam and Jetsam of humanity wer
victims of morphine, cocaine and heroin,
but also many of those well equipped by
training, education and wealth for lives of
the highest servlco to the community.
A mass of evidence showing how far the
Insidious evil of habit-forming drugs has
played havoc with unlucky member cf this
class has been obtained In this Inquiry,
undertaken for the purpose of demonstrat
ing th necessity for prompt remedial
legislation to counteract the effect of the
crippling of the Harrison drug act by codrt
decisions. There follow the accounts of
several slgnlncant cases.
THE CASE OP JAMES TVAI.UVCE
, There waa no happier young business
man In Philadelphia than the 'head of a
formerly well-known printing establish
ment call him James "Wallace. He had
built up a prosperous business and he was
favorably known among his business as
soclates. He was a member of two or
three clubs and regularly attended, church.
Ills domestic ' life was very happy. Hi
wife was a beautttul woman and the pair
had a sen with very- promising qualities.
Wallace loved his wife and his son and ha
gloried In the fact that he had been able ta
establish a business which brought them alt
their hearts' desire. He was a man of ex
emplary habits. He became afflicted wit
asthma. s
An acquaintance said to him one da:
"Why don't you take Blank's Coi
Syrup?" He did and found It gave him
uch relief temporarily, but It was neces
sary to tako a dose every day. In a short
time he found that one dose would not give
him relief and he had to take two, three
or four doses a day In order to keep his ail
ment subdued.
Once when purchasing a bottle of the
cough syrup he said to the druggist, "Isn't
there anything else which will have the
same effect on my cough that will not cost
mo so much?"
"Oh, yes," replied the druggist "The ef
fect of the cough Eyrup Is due to the oplura
In It. I can sell you some laudanum, which
will have the same effect and not cost yjtt
nearly so much."
So, thereafter, Wallace bought laudanum
for his asthma Instead of the cough syrupl
By and by he noticed that even on those
days when he did not suffer from asthma.Jie
became nervous, unless ha took a dose of ,
laudanum, and unable to work. ,
Now the young man had heard something
of the 6vlls of the opium habit, ind begaa
to wonder If he was In danger of acquir
ing It, so he made up his rplnd to stop the
use of laudanum. He adhered to his rese-lu
tlon for two days, but at the end of that (
time he had an Important business matter ' ,
on hnd and felt forced to go back to hi
laudanum In order to go on with his work.
"A CUIIB VOIX A CUP.E."
About this time he saw an advertisement ,
In a newspaper of a cure for the opium
habit which could be taken at heme. Ijte
paid ?8 a week for several weeks to hv
this, treatment sent to him. He learned
accidentally that "the cure for the cure"
for the, opium habit, which he had bea
taking, contained large quantities of alka
loids of opium. He waa not only poorer
for his experience with quackery, but, had
his habit more firmly fastened upon him.
Meanwhile his business had been steadily
falling off. He became a hlfttea. Irre
sponsible creature. Hia word was tyt
Irnger to be depended upon. Finally hia
business went to pieces entirely, and he waa
obliged to take up his old trade as Jour
neyman printer for a livelihood. But tfca
ever-Increasing doses of oplura whloh ha
was forced tq take In order to be able
work soon Incapacitated him. Whereas m
had once been reckoned ameeg the .jnoet
skillful mechanics in .his- Use, he now ,...
found It impossible tq keep a Ptaoe Jor an -length
of time. He could not earn mooajr
enough to support hi family, an4 had
eat into the saving of earUer yaart.
