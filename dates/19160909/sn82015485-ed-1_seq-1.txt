A REQUEST FOR SQUARE POLITICS
We are now facing a great political
campaign national, state and county,
and more than usual interest is being
manifested In local politics. While
ua n w -.11 . 1 1 -1 .
j tional and state yet it is the politics
of our own county and district that
interests most vitally from our close
association with them.. We .person
ally know nearly all ol the candidates
and a personal interest is after all
the keenest interest. It seems to us
that at this time when the candidate
Is getting things lined ap and laying
plans for his campaign that it is a
pretty good time to pause and get a
few facts settled in our own minds. .
Every one knows the political poli
cies of the World, Republican first,
last, and all the, time, Republican
right or wrong! Republican till we
die. When the old party goes we go
with it.
Enough said, all know where WE
stand, and the question now is where
does the OTH ER fellow stand? The
owner and publisher of the Reporter,
II- F. Kline, two years ago ran for
representative and- -our readers wllfc
remember that the World as a Re
publican paper and supporter of Re
publican candidates demanded to
know what the politics of the Re
porter was? An evasive , answer was
given and we were given to understand
that its policies were Democratic and
that it was none of our business but
it was our business for we refused to
head the ticket with a man's name
who was running a Democratic paper'
and running for the highest office in
the county on the Republican ticket
and asking for Republican support.
Now we are. up against the same
proposition again. Kline is running
for representative supposedly on the
Republican ticket and the -old old
trick that has been pulled repeatedly
is again operating. Mr. Lloyd Garri
son of Concwrdia lias jurchasd (on
supposition) - the Repor ter and will
make a Democratic paper of it many
leading Democrats subscribing to the
support of the paper. The truth la
the nut shell is this: Mr. Garrison
has not purchased or does not own
the ' ReDorter'it is only a. trick to
hside step -certain xampaigni issues.
Undler Canvass
ft
m
pen jn our lite we can see no rea
son why he should' not co me out on
the sq uare and tell j ust what his paper
stands for.' If it is Democratic say
so, if Republican let it be known. A
sham sale a few week3 before election
and then the paper reverting back
right after election to its old policies
is a stunt that has been pulled off un
til the people are used to it and we
cannot see how Intelligent voters can
be willing to support a man who has
played hide and seek with politics
ever since he has been in the newspa
per business and in fairness to the
voters of this county we ask the
owner and publisher of the Reporter
to couie out and make a clean and
open declaration of wnere he stands
in this campaign. .

whenever a presentation is given by
this well known company it is given
in the entirety and true to the au

from other shows to seek points on
the way the show has made a success
trying to profit by the information
that tbey might secure; but there
is no secret of the success with
the Ida Weston Rae show, it is sim

Wm. McAdams, an old timer of the
early -eighties in Trego county but
now living in South Dakota, has been
here for the last five days reviewing
old scenes and looking up some of his
friends. He says the country after
thirty years' transformation is not
recognizable. With Mrs. McAdams
they are visiting Thomas O'Toole on
the Hackberry which was once their
homestead. It is very interesting to
hear Mr. McAdams relate tales of
early Kansas history and he has slip
ped ' one or two out which would be
quite amusing if they could be
sprung at this time on the boys now
living here. They will return to
their home next week.
