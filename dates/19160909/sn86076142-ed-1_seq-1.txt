CHICAGO, Sept. . Recommenda
tions to al! bakers of the United
Slates that the Ave cent loaf of
bread be abandoned and the ten cent
loaf standardized were made after
considerable discussion at the clotting
session of the executive committee
of the National Association of Master
Bakers.
They urged, that (lie recommenda
tions be p'jt Inlo effect immediately.
It la aim recommended that where
local conditions make it necessary
the smaller loaf may be maintained,
with a price couslstent with cost of
manufacture. '
The bakers cited the following per
centages of incrense In cost of ingre
dients in the manufacture of bread
within the past two years:
Patent flour, 100 per cent; rye, 124
per cent: sugar, 66 per cent; shorten
ing, 60 per cent; Milk, 40 per cent;
salt, 14 per cent; wrapping paper, 70
per cent. Delivery costs also have
increased, It was stated, through an
advance of 100 per cent In the price
of gasoline and of 25 per cent In the
fed for horses.
The bakers went on record strongly
agaiiiHt any attempt to lower the
quality of bread. "No fluctuation In
the present market prices of Ingredi
ents, nor any future change, should
be permitted to Interfere In any way
with the quality of bread manufac
tured, nor with the services of the
baker to the public," he resolution
stated.
The conference here was an out
growth of the bakers' national con
vention at Salt Lake City, several
months ago, at which informal reso
lutions to the same effect were voted.
Already the price of bread has been
advanced, or the five cent loaf aban
doned, in several cities.

LONDON, Sept. 9. Kumiiniu now ix t he wene of a great liattle
between Hukmo-U tittin iiin n forces and armies of the central powers.
Eastern Rumania has become a fighting ground and, the opposing
armies are engaged from the Hlaek sea to the Danube, along a front
of about 70 miles.
Bulgarian fand Turkish troops have occupied Dultjik and two
other seaports, Sofia reports, and the fortress of Dobriteh or
Hazurzjik has been taken. The armies of the central powers have
wot yet erosNed the Danubo.
The Rumanians continue their offensive in Eastern Transylvania
and also have occupied Orsova, on the Danube. Advancing from
Caik Shereda, in Transylvania, the ltumauiaus are driving westward,
and Vienna admits the withdrawal of Austrian forces before attacks
"gainst Ilargitta.
The Russians, -un the northern end of their line, near Riga, have
begun a new undertaking and have crossed the Dviua north of
iJvinsk. Repeated efforts by the Germans to dislodge them failed,
Petrograd declared. "
Austro-Germans are fighting desperately to hold back the
Russians advancing on llalicz. lVtrograd says the Austro-German
forces have fallen back to the western bank of the Gnita Lipa,
while Vienna asserts-that troops of the central powers are holding
their own. Russian attacks against German positions on the Zlota
Lipa, southeast of Urze.any, failed with heavy losses, Berlin reports.
i
cent loaf of bread has been an Ameri
can institution for nearly a century,
many bakers objected to Its abandon
ment. They sought to urge reduction
in size of the five cent loaf instead.
It was cited against this, however,
that this would mean expenditure of
large sums for new sized pans and
new machinery, while shops are now
generally equipped for the ten cent
loaf.
Mr. ' McDonald said he believed
most of the bakers of the country
will adopt the plan suggested today.
"The bakers, the housewife and the
Tetailer will all benefit In the end
by the len cent loaf," he declared.
Later It was predicted that six cent
loaves of bread for Chicago would be
soen within a week. Millions of
lo.aves are consumed here daily. It
is estimated that one cent adds
$10,000 a day to the cost of living
liere in bread alone.

WASHINGTON, Sept. 9. Extension of the British mail censor
ship from its original purpose of destroying all trade to or from
Germany to the field providing data for Great Britain's fight for
commercial supremacy is seen here in admissions made by David
Lloyd George, the war secretary, before Parliament, just received in
full in this country. Lloyd George said :
"It is the practice to communicate to other departments con
cerned any information on matters of public interest which may be
obtained, through fhe censorship for such use to be mado of it as
the particular department may consider advisable. The government
is perfectly within its rights in using any information which comes
to it in these conditions for any public and national purpose."
This statement apparently lias been censored out of cable dis
patches to the United States. When asked about the matter, Secy.
Lansing said it had been called to the attention of the Slate depart-

ment officially, but declined to make any comment at this time.
It is understood, however, that the department will take s mow
serious view of Lloyd George's interpretation of the British War
office's power and will protest more vigorously than ever against
interference with neutral mails on the high seas. Although the.
American government has contended strongly against the wholesale
detentions and seizures of mail between neutral countries, , as in
violation of international law, so far there has been no formal
charge that improper use was being made of information gleaned
from opened neutral correspondence.
Officials here already were vexed at England's long delay in
answering the American censorship note of May 26, and it la prob
able that any inquiry into the new development will express that
feeling. A brief preliminary note was received July 20, but it waa
inconclusive.
