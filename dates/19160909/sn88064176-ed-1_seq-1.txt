Harper's Attack

Ruston, La., Sept. 2, 1916.
Editor Colax ( Chronicle:
There appeared in the Dodson Times
under date of Sptenmber 1st an article
under the signature of Senator S. J.
Harper, of Winnfield. praising Judge
Roberts, and reflecting on rne. The
author of this article starts out by say
ing: "For over ten years Judge Rob
erts has been one of the foremost leg
islators of this State." I admit that
Judge Roberts has been a legislator of
this State for the past ten years, but
it will take more than the assertion of
the Senator to prove that he has been
one of the foremost.
The fact that he has sptnt so much
of his time in recent years in the Leg
islature, coupled with the further fact
that he has never been Judge of any
Court prior to the time that he was ap
pointed to the Court of Appeal by Gov
ernor Hall, is sufficient evidence to
convince the average individual that
Judge Roberts is not qualified either
by study or training to hold that im
portant place and pass judgment on
the acts of District Judges, many of
whom have spent years in the study of
law and upon the bench.
Senator Harper refers to two deci
sions which were rendered by me while
judge, by which he attempts to show
Mr. Roberts' superiority to me in legal
learning and to further show that my
inclination as a judge has been towards
corporations instead of towards indi
viduals.
The first case to which he refers is
that of a negro named Davenport, who
brought suit through his attorney,
Judge Roberts, in my court to recover I
es for injuries done to him on
of the Dubach Lumber
Mrs. E.~d the demand of 1
dria, came up Frou- ' the evidence i
convincs me that he was drunk on co
caine and was responsible for his own r
injury. I believe in fairness, even to
corporations and that they, hke other 4
litigants, should not .be charged with
injuries for which they are not re- I
sponsible. The Supreme Court revers
ed this case, but it never came again
to the court. Why, I do not know.
Perhaps Senator Harper can say.
The other case referred to was the
case of Carter vs. Dubach Lumber Co.
for danrages done him in the mill. In
this case I gave judgment in favor of
Carter for $2500.00. I saw the man,
examined his wounds, and reached the
conclusion that l$500U.0') would do jus
tice between him and the lumber com
pany. The Supreme Court did not have
the opportunity of se(ing and examin
ing the man's wour:d's as I did, but
they increased the damages to $.5000.00.
Both courts held that the L aintiff was
entitled to damages, and it was not a
matter of reversal of my court, but
simply the difference as to what- the
Supreme Court and myself considered
just compensation in the matter.
The Senator's article gives me the
first information that Judge Roberts
was an attorney for the plaintiff in the
last case mentioned. The records show
that Messrs. Clayton & Hawthorn were
the attorneys for Carter. This can be
seen at page 239 in the 113 La. report.
The obvious purpose of the Senator
in referring to these decisions is to
make the public believe that I have fa
vored corporations in preference to in
dividuals in suits before my court. If
he will take the pains to examine the

Yours very truly,
W. N. McFARLAND,
Supervisor of Public Accounts.
reports of the cases that have gone
from my court to the Supreme Court, I
he will find ample evidence to show j
that there have been cases decided both i
for and against corporations and both <
for and against individuals. It is not I
impossible that a corporation may come I
into court with a just cause. In that
case they should have judgment It is
not impossible that an individual may
come into court with a bad cause. In
that event judgment should go against I
him.
Since it is one of the objects of Sena- I
tor Harper's article to line me up with
corporations, I call his attention to Act
No. 20 of the Acts of Legislature of
1914, which bears the name of Judge
Roberts as one of the authors thereof, I
and I ask him where in all the history
of legislation in Louisiana or among the
repbrts of Supreme Court will he find
a greater degree of favoritism shown
to corporations and employers than is I
shown in this act of 1914, which Mr.
Roberts was instrumental in eiiacting
into a law. The whole tendency of this 1
piece of legislation is to restrict the
amount of damages which an injured
party may recover from his employer
for an injury done through the care
lessness of the employer. As an illus
tration of the correctness of this as
sertion, a common lab:;rer who loses
both hands, or both arms, or both feet,
or both eyes may recover from the em
ployer responsible for his injury about
$2500.00. Under the law as it previous
ly existed the courts compensated such
losses in sums ranging from $500.00
to $16,000.00, Indeed, there is a case
decided in recent years where an indi
vidual obtained from a railroad $17,000
for the loss of one arm only.
In his article the Senator says: "In
a very large number of cases the Su
preme Court has reversed Judge Daw
ins." This statement is not true.
Fifty civil cases went from my court
to the Supreme Court while I was
judge. Forty of these cases were af
firmed, making a record for me of 80%
of cases affirmed. If the Senator will
take the pains to inquire, he will find
that few district judges have this per
centage of their cases affirmed. In the
cases that went to the Court of Appeal
and in criminal cases the percentage
of cases that were affirmed was even
greater than 80'.
The Senator says: "Judge Roberts
has never been reversed in any manner
of respect." Let the Senator be a lit
tle more definite. It is possible to make
such an assertion, but as a matter of
fact Judge Roberts may never have
had a case before any court to be re
versed. Let him say that Judge Rob
erts has had one, two, or a dozen cases
affirmed. Then we will understand
what he means. Judge Roberts has
been on the bench so short a time and
the percentage of cases which may be
appealed from that court is so small
that it is very probable that no case of
his has been before the Supreme Court,
either for affirmance or reversal.
The Senator comes with a certificate
of character from Judge Blanchard for
Judge Roberts. Why did he not state
that the case for which Judge Blanch
ard lauded Judge Roberts so highly
was one in which Judge Blanchard's
client got judgment at the bands of
Judge Roberts. Ever since the days
of Shylock the party winning a judg
ment at the hands of a judge has felt
like crying: "Oh! Most Righteous
J udge!"
In conclusion permit me to say that
I with the people of this district it is a
matter of no concern as to whether Mr.
I Roberts or I should be disappointed in
Sdeeat. The question with them is,
which man is more able to render them
efficient service in the Court of Appeal,

Judge Roberts has about served out
the time for which he was appointed.
The people had no say in his appoint
ment. This is the first opportunity
they have had to speak as between
him and any other applicant for that
position. There were at the time of
his appointment district judges and able
lawyers seeking the place, but Govern
or Hall passed these by and conferred
the appointment on his private secre
tary, who, at the time, had never seen
service on the bench, and was not even
practicing law.

Crimson Clover.
We decided last week that it
was essential to plant a winter
cover of some kind, and we also
decided that crimson clover was
one of the best we could plant,
so that a few words about how
and when and why may not be
amiss.
Plant crimson clover, because
it grows during the winter, keep
ing the land covered up and pro
tected from leaching, and be
cause it has the power of taking
nitrogen from the Bir and storing
it in ,the soil. When we buy cot
ton seed meal or nitrate of soda,
the nitrogen in those fertilizers
costs us about twenty-five cents
per pound, but when we plant
crimson clover, nitrogen costs us
so little per pound that it is diffi
cult to estimate. Experts of the
Department of Agriculture have
estimated that a good growth of
crimson clover plowed under in
the spring is equivalent to 1800
pounds of cotton seed meal put
on the soil.
However, do not expect the
best results from your crimson
clover the first year. It is adapt
ed to growth upon all of the soils
of Grant parish, but will not
grow at all unless the soil is thor
oughly inoculated. The best way
to accomplish this is to secure
the liquid inoculating material
free from .your demonstration
agent, to use this fall. Then
plant crimson clover on the same
land again next fall, and by that
time the soil will be so thorough
ly inoculated that you will have
first class results with the clover,;
and thatsame soil will be suitable
for inoculation of soils in otber
fields.
Plant crimson clover seed any
time from the first of September
to the middle of October, picking
a time when the soil has sufficient
moisture to bring up the seed at
once. Use about fifteen pounds
of seed to the acre. Secure seed
from a reliable seedsman, inocu
late thoroughly, and your results
will be good.
For further information apply
to your demonstration agent.
