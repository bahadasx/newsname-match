CITY OF TENTS AT FAIR GROUND
Bee Hives of Workers on Beau
tiful Tract This Morning.
Cars, Motor Trucks, Wagons,
Men, All Crowd the Space.
Like the fabled city of the plains
that sprang; up in a night, a city of
trnts is spring-ins up at the fair
grounds. Where three days ago there
was only naked ground and empty
buildings today the ground is covered
with tents and temporary buildings,
with machinery, live stock and people
and the former vacant buildings are
like bee-hives.
Every road and footpath running
i to the fair grounds is crowded. Ev
ert' sort of vehicle from big gasoline
trucks to one-horse express wagons
crowds the roads and streets. Going
towards the fair gr'-i "- they are
piled high with almost everything
man makes and sells. Returning they
are empty. The drivers crowd each
other for wheel room and hand joshes
and curses back and forth.
All this Is a necessary preliminary
to the big free state fair w.iich opens
Monday. The fair grounds today look
like a hopeless jumble of mjn, stock,
machinery, tents and building ma
terial. It doesn't appear possible that
everything will be in readiness Mon
day morning when the formal opening
takes place. But It will be ready
John Wright, deputy county clerk,
who has had more or less to do with
every fair for fifteen years, stood look
ing over the grounds today from the
steps of the secretary's office.
"It doesn't seem possible that all
these tents, all the machinery and all
the stock will be in place by Monday
morning." was remarked to him.
Carpenters Are Busy.
"I know it looks that way," replied
Wright, "but it will be ready. As a
matter of fact things are farther
elong this morning than on any Sat
urday morning before the fair I can
remember. There are more exhibits
on the ground now. too, than I can
remember heretofore."
Probably seventy-five carpenters or
amateur carpenters are at work on the
-h., tortav Thev are throwing to
gether the framework for big dining
tents, cigar and candy stands, soft
drink "parlors." and all other places
neC(.ssary to the modern state fair.
The sound of the saw and hammer
may be heard in all parts of the
grounds. . -
river in the northwest part of the
grounds carload after carload of farm
machinery has been dumped. No ef
fort has been made to place It in the
form of an exhibit, but tractors will
take hold of it today and jerk the dif
ferent pieces Into their proper Place.
The sidetrack running into tne
grounds Is full of cars waiting to be
unloaded. Great stacks of baled hay
nnd straw are being piled up beside
the stock barns for the stock that is
being unloaded every hour.
The Johnny Jones Shows.
The Johnny J. Jones shows thirty
of them will reach Topeka this after
noon and within a few hours will fill
up the one big gap at the fair Rround
Thev will cover more ground than any
other carnival company the fair man
agement has ever had. By Sunday
moving the shows -will be set up
ready for the crowds, and there
be a crowd Sunday but the shows will
not open until Monday. The big show
comes to Topeka from Lincoln. Neb.,
the fair there did not close until
last night.
A trr-oat TT1 H Tl V OX
hibits will come to
Topeka from Lincoln this afternoon.
Topeka follows wntum 11 , ,
and will Ret moet everything Lincoln
had except the exhibits of local peo- j
pie Knowing what is coming froml
Lincoln in the way of livestock, the
livestock managers at the fair grounds
have already begun worrying about
space. .
Fifteen of the thirty horses Miss
Loula Lonsr will bring for the horse
show are on the ground. They were
sent here direct from the Longview
farm in Missouri. The other fifteen
will come by express from Rochester,
N. Y.t where Miss Long has been ex
hibiting them Other horses and
equipment for the horse show will
come in this afternoon and tonight.
Exhibitors Stand In Line.
The office of the secretary has been
moved to the fair grounds and the
force increased from two men to about
ten. People were lined up at every
window today making arrangements
for exhibits, for concessions or quar
reling because somebody had done
something or had failed to do some
thing. One of the favorite pastimes
of people who follow the fairs is to
fuss with everybody else who follows
the fairs. Tnat, they say, is the only
way to be sure of getting all that is
coming to them.
There is every indication that there
will be plenty to eat at the big fair.
The biggest tents In course of con
struction today are dining tents, most
of them being erected by church or
ganizations. Preachers, elders, dea
cons and laymen are at the grounds
in their shirt sleeves sawing boards
and striking at nails. Members of '
sewing (societies, aid societies and mis- j
sionary societies are there in bonnets
looking after coal oil stoves, refriger
ators, table cloths and dishpans.
The rain Thursday put the grounds
in excellent condition. There is no
duet and there is no mud. The grass
looks greener than it does on most
Topeka lawns. O. M. Keats, super
intendent of racing, said today the
track couldn't be in better shape.
The grounds will be closed Sunday
to the public on account of the ac
tivities of the workmen.
MAYOR HOUSE SETS
ASIDE TUESDAY AS
j A REAL "TOPEKA DAY"
Once to every man it is said on
good authority comes a secret ambi
tion. That ambition may be a desire
to be president of the United States
or to be shipping clerk hi a soap fac
tory. Wherein hangs a tale:
Twenty-five years ago Mayor House,
then a printer, was setting type in a
country newspaper office. Copy was
all written in longhand. It was near
press time and everything was in the
cUrf'ftto but a proclamation of a holi
day. House had it about half finished
when he hit a snag in the shape of a
word the meaning of which he could
not decipher, neither could, he spell it.
He threw in a bunch of letters and in
brackets thereafter he set "Great
God!"
The proofs went to the proofreader.
The proofreader, believing he could
add to House's education by verbal
explanation, walked over to the
printer.
"That word," he said with a look
that was meant to register tolerance
toward the printer ana superiority in
authority and social position, "is an
nuary. It means yearly."
Mayor House, to use his present
title, was visibly impressed.
"If I ever get a chance," he vowed,
"I'll use that word." That was twenty-five
years ago.
Today the mayor issued a proclama
tion, calling attention to Topeka dav
next Tuesday at the Topeka free fair
and asking that it be made a half
holiday. It was his first proclamation.
Befittingly, he tried to use the word
"'annuary" twice but a friend who was
superintending the job wouldn't stand
for it, so they compromised and the
mayor used it once.
The Proclamation.
"It seems fitting and proper that the
city of Topeka set .aside one day on
which its citizens, irrespective of race,
color or creed, or present condition of
servitude, may do honor to the great
Free State Fair and the men, who,
thru trials and difficulties nave made
this grand annuary event possible. I,
therefore, suggest and request that
Tuesday, September 12, be made a
half holiday and that all firms, es
tablishments, corporations and co
operative associations within the above
said city close their doors at the hour
of 12 o'clock (noon) on that date and
remain closed during the afternoon, t
"(Signed) I
"JAY E. HOUSE. Mayor." I
business is expected to be practi
cally shut down Tuesday, in accord
with the mayor's proclamation. A
large number of the stores have al
ready announced their intention to
close.
HOLD UP AND KILL
Bobbers Shoot Mine Manager;
Off With $12,000.
Escape in Auto Robbery
Three Miles in Country.
Martins Ferry. O., Sept. 9. Lee
Rankin, superintendent of the Flor
ence mine of the Youghiogheny Coal
company here was held up ty two auto
bandits today, robbed of $12,000 and
shot and killed.
Rankin was in a taxi driven by
Oliver Pickens. The money was the
weekly pay roll of the miners. The
holdup occurred under a grade cross
ing between this city and the mine,
about three miles out, shortly before
noon. Two foreigners ordered Pick
ens to stop. Rankin, who was armed,
immediately suspected a holdup, and
jumped out of the taxi. He was eight
feet from the machine when one of
the bandits shot him. The bullet sev
ered an artery. The highwayman,
covering the driver, grabbed the
money which Rankin had in a satchel
and sped away thru the woods.
Pickens lifted Rankin into the taxi
and sped back to the hospital here.
Rankin died as he was being lifted
from the car. He had bled to death.
Sheriff C. Butler and Chief of Police
Hyland commandeered five automo
biles, loaded the entire police force of
Martins Kerry and a number of armed
citizens into the cars and sped away
in pursuit. Bloodhounds also were
put on the trail.

Lincoln, Xeb., Sept. 9. President
Zehrung, of the Western league an
nounced today that the Wichita team
would be transferred to Colorado
Springs for the remainder of the sea

The remainder of the games sched
uled at Wichita will be played at Col

WILSON RECITES POEM
ON HIS LACK OF BEAUTY
Atlantic City. Sept. 9. President
Wilson recited a limerick at a charity
musicale at the Traymore hotel here
and elicited a storm of applause. .It
was:
"For beauty I am not a star:
There are others more handsome bv
far
My face, I don't mind it.
Because I am behind it
It's the people In front I jar."
Announces He Will Back Up on
His Confession.
TALKS WITH TOPEKA ATTORNEY
But Lawyer Fears a Fair Trial
in Shawnee County.
Fire and Cruel Death in Yacant
House Recalled.
Fred Bissell who went to Lansing,
just ahead of a mob, last spring, fol
lowing the murder of little Edna Dins
more, is negotiating with a Topeka at
torney and has announced that he will
back up on his confession and stand
trial.
He is negotiating with A. P. Tone
Wilson. Wilson admitted that today.
The fact that Bissell has backed up on
his confession and that he will de
mand a trial came from the peniten
tiary at Lansing where Bissell has
been kept since his escape from the
mob.
Every time Bissell's name is men
tioned in Topeka it recalls the wild
night last spring when a mob went
thru the city and county jails looking
for him then drove in automoblies to
Lawrence only to find that Sheriff L.
L. Kiene had left with the prisoner.
Fear Fair Trial.
"If I represent Bissell," said Wil
son today, "and I'll admit he has been
negotiating with me, I certainly would
not attempt to try him in this county.
He could not begin to get a fair trial
in Shawnee county. A change of ve
nue would be necessary.
Bissell made a full confession at the
state penitentiary and signed it. He
told how he lured the little girl by
promise of a pair of new shoes to the
old vacant house on W est Fifth street.
how he attacked her, then strangled
her to stifle her screams, how he left
her for dead, then went back and set
fire to the house where she lay, still
alive.
He told all this before three or four
men. It was taken down in shorthand
and transcribed. Bissell read it over.
He said it was correct. Then he signed
his name to it in the presence of wit
nesses. He agreed then to plead guilty
whenever he should be arraigned in
Shawnee county. Even the arraign
ment has been postponed from time to
time because of the fear of a lynch
ing.
And now Bissell wants a trial, with
a jury and with a court room filled
with spectators.
STAMP TAX IS OFF
Shippers Xo Longer Required to Tay
Revenue on Bills of Lading.
Shippers will not be required to
place government revenue stamps
upon bills of lading, according to a
telegram received by W. L, Bridges,
local freight agent for the Union Pa
cific railroad, from E. E. Calvin, pres
ident of the road. The order becomes
effective today.
The tax that has been levied is 1
cent on each order, no matter how
large or how small. It is known as
the "war revenue" and has been in
force since December 1, 1915.
DEMAND REPLY TODAY
Miners Weary Waiting for Final An
swer of Operators.
Kansas) City, Mo., Sept. 9. Refusing
to consider the counter proposition
presented by the coal operators yes
terday, the miners' committee asked
for a final answer today. Operator
representatives said they would try
and have it ready.
Indications are that the Oklahoma
operators who withdrew from the
Southwest Operators' association will
grant the Oklahoma miners the inter
state contract demanded.
HOLD CORNER ON EGGS
221 Firms Have 148.000,000 Dozen In
Winter Storage.
Washington, Sept. 9. Two hundred
and twenty-one firms are holding
marly 5,000,000 cases of eggs about
143,000,000 dozen in cold storage, ac
cording to the latest report to :he de
partment of agriculture. Great as the
figures may seem the official report
shows them 10 per cent less than a
month ago.

The recent appointment of General von Hindenburg to direct dl opera

MUNICIPAL MILK .
PLANTS IN KAN.
IS WELFARE PL AN
Bill
in , Legislature for Fare
Product in State.
Towns May "ot Own Herds to
Insure Their Milk Supply.
PURCHASE FROM DAIRY FARMS
Pasteurize and' Sell It to Con
sumer Under a Guarantee.
Higher Quality and Lower Cost
Would Be Result.
A bill providing for the establish
ment of municipal milk plants is to
go before the state legislature next
January. Certified grades, of milk and
lower prices to the consumer is the
argument behind the demand.
Numerous epidemics in Kansas in
the last few years have been traced to
impure milk. Hundreds of cases of
sickness among babies and many
deaths are claimed to have been due
to the sale of impure milk or milk not
up to a standard demanded by public
health officials. To correct the rem
edy a demand will be made on the
law makers for an enactment permit
ting cities and towns to own their milk
plants and sell a single standard of
pasteurized and certified milk. .
Buy From Farms.
It is not the plan of persons behind
the movement to provide for cities to
buy or own dairy herds. Instead they
will purchase milk from dairy farms,
pasteurize the milk and sell it to the
consumer. It is probable, however,
that the measure will contain a clause
enabling cities to own dairy herds
should their commissions or councils
decide to follow that course. The
general plan provides for a central
municipal milk station to which all
milk offered to the public must be
brought for pasteurization or certifi
cation. Distribution and sale of milk would
be in charge of the cities of the state
and would be sold from municipal
milk wagons. Bocti a higher quality
of milk and a lower price to consum
ers is claimed by persons who are
urging the passage of the bill.

It was semi-officially announced to
day that "important forces" are now
co-operating with the Russians in the
Dobrudja. A further Tretiremt nt may
be necessary both because' the Dob

and because the enemy has massed

Columbus, O., Sept. 9. The Rev.

said today he did it because he "long
ago recognized the divine design in
making the eye eighty times as large
as the auditory nerve," thus "turning
people's eyes into ears." "The movies
get the people," said Dr. Doolan, "and
why shouldn't the church use mod

Decrease in Motherhood
Mortality in 13 Years.
Atlantic City, X. J.t Aug. 9. Miss
Julia Lathrop, chief of the National
Children's bureau, speaking on
"Mothers in Politics" before the Na
tional American Woman Suffrage as
sociation, pleaded for suffrage for wo
men "to protect maternity and in
fancy a sheer question of national
policy."
She said:
"I am not to offer an address upon
suffrage in general nor upon the
rights of mothers which they may
claim on the general basis of citizen
ship, but only to speak of one parti
cular aspect of the rights of mothers
which has been strangely overlooked
and to tell you why I believe that the
votes of woman would undoubtedly
be used to protect mothers.
Whatever primarily concerns mothers
must also concern everybody.
Women Just "Taken for Granted."
"When men began to struggle for
the ideal of democracy it was such
hard work that they had no time or
strength of mind to think of women as
individually interested in the same
ideal. Women were taken for granted
as part of the equipment or impedi
menta of men's lives and their special
interests, duties and hazards were re
garded by men with indifference and
by women with fatalism.
"This state of mind has uncon
sciously persisted against all the
changes of civilization and now sud
denly and wonderfully we have be
come conscious. It is like the break-ing-up
of a hard winter. Now we have
warm human solicitude on the part of
men, a demand for education on the
part of women an education which
is demanded not as an individual right
or privilege, but as a social duty.
"As the children's bureau has work
ed forward with its series of infant
mortality studies, again and again the
indivisible connection between the
well-being of mother and child has
been shown in some new aspect.
Other Mortality Causes Decrease.
"Most of us have a complacent feel
ing that the grave risks of maternity
are at an end, yet a study of mor
tality rates for a period of from 1900
to 1913 reveals no decrease in the ma
ternal mortality. Why is this? Since
the discoveries of Pasteur and Lister
and Dr. O. W. Holmes, it has been
recognized that the cases of infection
are preventable by sheer scientific
cleanliness. AH the other varying
causes of maternal mortality are not
so simply treated altho in steadily
growing measure it is found that they
can be made to yield to scientific skill.
"Other preventable causes of death
have yielded In this 13 year period to
the knowledge of our day; the typhoid j
fever death rate, the diphtheria rate
have been cut in half, deaths from tu- ,
berculosis greatly lessened, yet no ap- '
preciable diminution in maternal mor
tality, altho the method of preventing
infection and fever has been available
longer than the control of diphtheria.
Last year it is estimated upon the cen
sus figures for the registration area
that 15,000 women died from the va
rious complications of child bearing,
and an American authority has said
lately that 20,000 is nearer the true
figure.
Mothers Xeeded at Home.
"If nature relentlessly exacted this
cost of keeping the race alive, we
should not urge votes for women as a
remedy; but she does not. Nature
wants mothers to live, to care for their
children, to be happy with them, and
to give happiness.
"Women are told to stay at home
and care for the children. Let us
make it possible for them to do so. Do
the women who go daily to work in a
mill leaving babies at home to die at
a rate three fold greater than the ba
bies of richer mothers; do they leave
their homes out of sheer perverse joy
in the emancipated life of the free
woman? Let -the infant mortality re
ports answer. Let us put ourselves
to the task of setting up a standard of
protection for the life of mother and
child, and then dedicate ourselves to
securing that protection for every
mother."

Russians Enter Third Winter
Confident of Victory.
BY WILLIAM PHILIP SIMMS.
Imperial Headquarters, Russian
Army, Sept. 9. Germany must send
400,000 to the aid of the demoralized
Austrians if she hopes to stiffen their
resistance, General Michael Alexieff,
chief of staff of Emperor Nicholas'
armies told me today.
Furthermore, German troops must
provide the driving power if Von Hin
denbu rg attempts the great eastern
offensive talked about in Berlin. The
Austro-Germans cannot count upon
the Turks for substantial aid, said the
man who directs the movements of
Russia's millions of troops. The
Turks can send no more than forty
thousand men to support their Teu
tonic allies.
General Alexieff received me in a
small, plainly furnished office adjoin
ing the headquarters of Emperor
Nicholas. A flat top desk, a few
chairs and maps were the only fur
nishings. The general sat behind the
desk like an American business man.
He resembles much the pictures of
Kioliner. His hair is beginning to turn
white over the temples. The long ends
of his white moustache turn up,
slightly above the fighting jaw. His
eyes are deeply set, small, grey and
piercing. He wears silver rimmed
spectacles. In conversing he habitual
ly pencils lines as if drawing rivers
and roads, sketching in arrows show
ing the direction of attacks.
Don't Under Estimate Enemy.
I asked him if he credited the re
port of an Austro-German-Turkish
combined offensive against Russia.
"Despite the encircling ring of the
allies and the continual pressure they
are exerting on all sides, I would hesi
tate to say that such an offensive is
impossible," he replied. "The biggest
mistake a general can make is to un

LABOR POLITICS
Organization Among Unions
for Political Purposes.
Stand Back of Candidates Who
Favor Labor Legislation.
A Political League of Labor, formed
from the American Federation of La
bor, the Kansas State Federation of
Laobr and Topeka Industrial council,
will be organized Friday at a meeting
of Topeka labor men, according to an
announcement made Friday night by
Frank B. Brown, president of the To
peka Industrial council, at a meeting
of the council. The object of the
league, according to Brown's outlines,
is to back to the last ditch all candi
dates, city, county, state and national
who stand for labor legislation as well
as legislation in favor of the people.
Brown explained that at present a
list is kept of all candidates and their
answers to legislative questions pro
pounded to them by labor unions. Also
the expressions of these candidates are
announced to the labor unions.
With the organization of the league
among laboring men in Topeka as a
nucleus it is hoped to spread the or
ganization throughout the state among
all labor unions.
HUGHES IS PROMOTED
Topekan Shifted to Official Capacity
in Regular Army.
Lieutenant James Hughes, who
went to the border with Battery A as
a first lieutenant, is now serving in
the same capacity with Battery C of
the Third Field Artillery of the regu
lar army. While Lieutenant Hughes
is still a Xational Guard officer his
transfer to command of a battery' in
the regular army is looked upon by
Hughes's friends in Topeka as an ad
vancement as well as an excellent
training for him.
Lieutenant Hughes has worked for
and dreamed of army life since child
hood. No sooner had he reached the
proper age than he joined the Na
tional Guard and has been one of its
most loyal members ever since, serv
ing in nearly every capacity from
brigade trumpeter up to his present
position. The battery to which he has
been assigned is at Kagle Pass.
