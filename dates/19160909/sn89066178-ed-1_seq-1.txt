This rtraight-forward and states
man-like utterance voices the spirit
and sentiment of the fathers of de
mocracy who threw down the
gauntlet before the thrones and
hierarchies of the Old World.
True there is nothing in the let

or Garfield would not have unhesi
tatingly subscribed to, for the mau

as well as the measures adopted to
render permanent those distinguish
ing glories that differentiate this
republic from all Old World gov-
ernmenta where monarchist princi
ple whether represented by kings,
czars, kaisers or popes, prevail.
Soman Boycott and Censorship
It is. indeed, a startling illustra
tion of the extent to which the Old
World monarchist theory of the pa
pacy has progressed in this country
during recent years, that the
pledges above given ahould not find
ready voice from all statesmen who
profess loyalty to our fundamental
democracy, but since the Roman
Catholic hierarchy haa undertaken
to make America dominantly Ro
man Catholic by methods historical
ly approved by the papacy, viz.,
the boycott, the equally odious cen
sorship of the press by organized
secret oath-bound societies acting in
nniaon for the advancement of the
papal theory and wielding the club
of the Catholic vote, and by at
tempted censorship or suppression
of freedom of speech and public as
sembly, by means of intimidation,
rioting, mobocracy, murderous as
sault, and even murder, we have be
held the humiliating spectacle of
statesmen speaking with bated
breath, or remaining tongue-tied in
the presence of religio-political
questions that sinks at the rery
rilals of fres institution, for fear
of antagonizing the Roman Catholic
political machine whose threat of
a solid vote has been so constantly
kept before the politicians, anil
whose brutal boycott haa been con
tinually in evidence.
It waa perhape necessary that this
reactionary Old World despotic in

organized power that has been sys
trmstirally operating through the
Knights of Columbus, the Aucient
Order of Hibernians, the American
Federation of Catholic Societies
and the
J emits In Onr Politics
has been equally active in creating a
nation-wide censorship of the pre
by which it haa succeeded under the
absurd pretext of not arousing re
ligious prejudice, in excluding from
full, free, public discussion, such
vital political issues aa appropria
tion of public funds for sectarian
purposes, the safegusrding of con
stitutional guarantees, of freedom
of religious discussion, freedom
of press, freedom of speech
and acmb!v basic proviiona of
our OKGAN'IC LAW that are a
fundamental to free intitution as
censorship and suppression by force
are essential to the maintenance of
despotism.
Pending Democratic Kcnalit&nce
Signa are not wanting that indi
cate that the greatest awakening in
the history of our government is at
hand. The recent introduction of
the Free Tresa Iefrnc fosgue's
demand for an investigation of pa
pal activity in relation to our free
government mnrks a mile stone in
our history. The psrrlotlc answer
to Rome's orgsnization and promo
tion of such secret outh-bound so
cieties aa the Ancient Order of Hi
bernian and the Knights of Colum
bus finds expression in such splen
did American organizations as the
Guardians of Liberty, the member
ship of which, is about one million,
the Knights of Luther, the Junior
Order of American Me hanijs, the
Soup of America, the Grr.u S;tiii
Order, and other patriotic soci.i.i'i
whose memberships sggregate many
millions. And now conies the awak
ening democratic sentiment ex
pressing anew its fealty to freedom
and the protection of human rights,
by the enactment of convent iuspe
tion lawa in two great southern com
monwealths, and in the sweeping
patriotic victories in recent primary
elections, north, south, ca.t anil
west.
It remained, however, for ex
Congressman A. W. ItfTertv to set
the pnee for the people' represents-,
live, hr frankly pledging his loyal'
tv to the fundamental
lesls of our
free government in the face of j
Komc a determined and persistent e f-
fort to replace our splendid libera! '
government by the papal govern-
mental provisions including retrii'-'
tion, censorship, sectarian political
advancement and enrichment and
sectarian education.
In an address to the electorate of
hia dictrict, Mr. Lafferty further
emphasizes this position in the fol
lowing words;
"If elected, I shall use the powers
of the office of congressman to make
the constitution and the flag mean
all that our revolutionary fore
fathers intended that they should
mean. I believe that education ia
the only thin? that will ever com-
pletclv atrike tbe shackles of slaverv
from the mi.ids and the bodies of'CMPny ' history as revealed by the
the people. The three most impor
tant things looking toward general
education are: Our matchless pub
lic school system, our right of free
speech and our right to a free
press."
What Lafferty 'i Election Means
When a maa of Mr. Laffertv's
courage, ability, and experience 'in
i.ational law making range him
self on the aide of .the liberal de
mocracy of the fathers, a great op
portunity ana a grave responibilitr

ferty has aroused the united oppo
sition of the Roman Catholic polit
ical machine, while his splendid
stand in boldly championing the
rights of the actual settlers to home

forest reserves has long since

CONGRESSMAN'S ADDRESS URGES ACTION
Evils of Invisible Government Exposed Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh

deadly way.
The sjeeeli is far too long to repro
duce in Tub Menace, out we give
several verbatim excerpts that indi

grasp of root causes that are mining
and sapping our free institutions, and
which call for the courageous and
determined opposition of all lovers

one who ia familiar with the phil
rise and fall of natious. can remiin
indifferent to the lessons which are
here pressed home with the err
pel ling force of irrefutable facts
and unanswerable logic, in this ex
posure of how invisible government
is destroying the liberal democracy
that has long made America the
lode star for the poor and oppressed
of all the world.
In the first part of hia addrcf
Congressman Lindbergh says:
"There is a sinister influence at
work in our country, which, if it
ia not checked, intends to complete

appreciable effect upon political

there must be an understanding on

against the political activities of

are such that they can not be ig
