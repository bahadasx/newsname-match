In Spite of Incessant Bombardment,
Instruction in Rheims
Goes On
(Associated Press)
Rheims, France, Sept. 9. With a
daily average of 1,300 pupils attend
ing school, above and below ground,
in Rheims during the last eighteen
months under intermittent bombard
ment, not a single injury or accident
ha3 happened to any of the scholars.
Classes have-to be interrupted for
days at a time, but the fact never
lessens the zeal of the teachers or the
diligence of the pupils, though the
enemy is not more than 2,000 yards
off.
To a large extent the classes are
held in the cellars and wine-caves of
the town, in some instances two stor
ies below the surface of the street.
There the air is more humid and
there is less light than in the ordinary
schoolroom above ground, but other
wise there is little difference in the
conditions or the routine.
When a bombardment begins some
of the children how signs of fear;
not always for themselves but for
father or mother whom they think
must be in danger. When the bom
bardment has completely ceased the
children are dismissed and sent home.
The streets are then safe excepting
the exterior boulevards where the
children are warned not to go.
Some of the school scenes are trag
ic, others comic notwithstanding trag-j
ical surroundings. A class will be at
work when suddenly a servant opens
the door and calls out that "they are
bombarding close by." A second or
two later the noise of a shell burst
ing on a nearby hours makes the
smaller children tremble and cry. At
once the classes are led down into the
cellars, some of them carried by sol
diers who have come in off the street
to avoid shell splinters.

Advised as Standard Price of Baker's
Bread
Chicago, Sept. 9. Recommenda
