principal difference between the

goternlment esti. ates nearly 60
ei cent and yet preserves all the
¢essential needs for the safe carriage
Oof the mail. When it is realized
that the principal item of expense
ia handling the mail is that of
Otransportation and that the govern
Snment has to pay as much for carry
ing the containers as for the mail
Phiatter itself, the importance of
.any reduction in the weight of its
equipment is readily understood.
IAs late as 1907, when the old
.heavy leather bags were vet in
general use, the weight of equip
ment carried almost equaled the
Othe weight of mailmatter, cou
'tequeutly nearly half of the ex

Stails was due to the weight of
i.;uipment. The figures given by on

Hay is Rich in Protein-Relished By

No other hay crop allows such a

harvest season may extend from late t
August to late October, including the I
r hay and seed crop. In fact, new lea
pedesa begins to come into local mar
kets in late July. Such early cutting,
however, will not yield a large crop,
although the quality is excellent., as
