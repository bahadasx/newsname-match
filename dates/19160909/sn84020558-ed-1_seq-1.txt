WASHINGTON. Sept. 8. Heavy
damage to the country's cereal crops
during August caused a loss of many
millions of bushels of prospective pro
duction, cutting down the outlook for
wheat to below the amount required
for home consumption.
The department of agriculture's
monthly forecast, issued today, esti
mates the wheat crop at 611,000,000
bushels, or 9,000,000 bushels less than
is calculated to be necessary for do
mestic use. A carry-over of approx
imately 1 HO. 000. 000 bushels of old wheat
from last year's record-breakinc crop,
however, will make up the deficiency
and leave something like 100.000.000
bushels available to supply the heavy
demand of foreign nations for Amer
ican wheat.
Spring wheat, parcned by hot and
dry weather, showed a loss of 43.000.
000 bushels since the August forecast
of production, while corn estimates
were 67,000,000 bushels smaller than
forecast a month ego.
Preliminary estimate of the winter ; the meeting that h
wheat crop places the production at did not materialize.
4:i:.,000,mi0 bushels, anil mat or spring
wheat at 150.000,000. The prospective
spring wheat crop is the smallest in
22 years, and 200,000,000 bushels less
than harvested last year. The total
wheat crop is placed at Ml.000.OWi
bushels, which is 400.000.ona bushels
less than last year's record-breaking
crop of 1.012.000.0110 bushels. The com
bined winter and spring wheat crop is
the smallest since 1900 and the acreage
is the lowest in 25 years.
The heavy loss in prospective pro
duction of corn was due to drought.
In Oklahoma many fields of corn were
cut for ensilage or fodder. The total
crop is forecast at 2,273,000.000 bushels,
which is 22. OOO'KO) bushels less than
the average for the last five years.
An unusually short, output of white
potatoes for winter supply is forecast.
Production of 318.0oo.0"O bushels is in
dicated. That is 46.000.000 bushels less
than forecast a month ago and the
smallest crop sinre 1911.
Other losses from the production es
timates made n month ago are:
Oats. 43.000,000 bushels; barlev. 11.
000.00 bushels: buckwheat. 1. 300.000

the vote. We want it now. I want it
to come during your administration."
Again the great audience of women

the suffrage question caused Mrs. Car

WAR THEATER SHIFTED
TO EASTERN RUMANIA
(By Republican Associated Press Leased Wire)
Rumania now is the scene of a great battlu between Russo-Rumanian
forces and armies of the central powe ra. Eastern Rumania has become a
fighting qround and the opposing armies are engaged from the Black Sea to
the Danube, alonq a front of about 70 miles.
Bulgarian and Turkish troops have occupied Baltjik and two other sea
ports, Sofia reports, and the fortress of Dobritch, or Bazardjik has been
taken. The armies of the central powers have not yet crossed the Danube.
The Rumanians continue their offensive in eastern Transyslvania and
also nave occupied Crzova on the Danube. Advancing from Csik Czereda, in
Transylvania, the Rumanians are driving westward and Vienna admits the
withdrawal of Austrian forces before attacks against Hargitta,
The Russians on the northern end of their line near Riga have begun
a new undertaking and have crossed the Dvina north of Dvinsk. Repeated
efforts by the Germans to dislodge them failed, Petroqrad declares.
Ai.stro-Germans are fighting desperately to hold back the Russians
advancing on Halicz. Petrograd says the Austro-German forces have fal
len back to the western bank of the Gnita Lipa, while Vienna, asserts that
troops of the central powers are holding their own. Russian attacks against
Gorman positions on the Zlota Lipa, southeast of Brzezany failed with heavy
losses, Berlin reports. - ttJts
O n the Somme front violent bombardment continues. The French report
a further advance for their troops in Vermandovjilers. In the Berny-En-Senterre
and Chaulnes sector both the Germans and French claim successes
tor their armies in the repulse of attacks.

NEW YORK, Sept. 8. The second
day of the strike of unionized em
ployes of New York's subway, elevat
ed and surface lines brought little in
terruption to service but developed a
contest which, it was said, may de
cide whether the city's carmen will
be permitted to organize.
Theodore P. Shonts. president of
the Jnterborough Rapid Transit com
pany and the New York Railways
company, struck at the union by of

tors) who quit the union by tomor
row. Strike breakers, he declared,
woulr) be put in the places of all these
employes who do not accept his offer.
I'nion leaders tonight threatened to
extend the strike to the lines of the
Thrd Avenue Railroad company, the
Second Avenue company and the Un
ion ftalyways company unless the
heads of these lines pledge' themselves
not to circulate individuaf contracts
among their1 men similar to those
binding the workers not to ask for
vage increases for two years which
brought on the Interhorough strike
snd the sympathetic New York rail
ways strike. The Thrd avenue line,
It was Hflld, flatly refused the de
mands. James I,. Ouackenbush, general
counsel for the Interborough, declared
nt an Investigation held by the pub
lic service commlm-lon. that ' som
legislation must enacted even to
amending the I'nlted States consti
tution, if necessary, to resuming a
government of laws and not of men."
"It was not part of the business of
President Roosevelt to Interfere in
th anthracite strike situation." he
added. V-Wlthout Intending to criti
cise or engage in political discussion
'.. It is my opinion that it was no part

Mr. Quackenbush lold the commis
sion it had no ri lit to inquire into
the individual contracts and that tne
question of wages alone was arbi
trable. I'nion officials asserted tonight that
3,000 elevated railway and subway
employes were out. but made no
claims that service was being crippled.
Mayor Mitchell, in a statement to
night, declared that, pending the in

Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, honorary

favors woman suffrage and voted for
it in his own state.

WITH MEXICANS
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
EL. PASO, Tex., Sept. 8. Thirty
Mexicans, supposed to be Villistas,
made a raid on the engineer camp of
the American punitive expedition and
escaped with a mule, according to
members of the expeditionary force
arriving here today from Mexico by
way of Columbus, N. M. This incur
sion, which took place last Wednesday
on an isolated portion of the camp at
OJo Federico, is believed by the mili
tary authorities here to have been in
directly responsible for today's rumor
of the clash between the Fifth cavalry
and Sixteenth infantry regiments and
a band of Villistas south of El Valle.
Chihuahua. Otherwise, the story of
that fight must be called a pure hoax,
the officers say.
Information received at the military
headquarters in Kl Paso confirms the
presence of Villa in the Santa Clara
canyon.
Villa, on his northward march, told
the natives that ho Intended to eat
dinner at Parral on the Mexican In
dependence Day, September 16, but he
later said he would take part in the
celebration at Chihuahua City on the
evening of the loth, which is carnival
night in Mexico. Such, at least, is the
story brought here today out of Mexico
by a man well acquainted with the
Iieople. He also said" he talked to a
Mexican who recently interviewed
Villa in an effort to secure the release
of some commandeered mules. The
Mexican said the bandit chief looked
very thin and yellow and still used
crutches when walking, although able
lo ride a horse.
A rumor current In Chihuahua City,
travelers report, to the effect that Gen
eral Jose Cavazoswho headed an ex
pedition some months ago to hunt for
the body of Villa, when Villa was sup
posed to be dead, was killed this week
by his own men, who then deserted to
the bandits.
All accounts of the natives agree
that Villa, on his northward march,
had only a few rounds of cartridges for
each man. But now evidence is said
to show that some caches of ammuni
tion have been recovered by the ban
dits, as they are carrying full h,elts and
bandoliers.
Another Mexican report, apparently
reliable, has it that Carranza has with
drawn from the presidential race in
favor of Obregon. This is taken as a
step toward conciliating the factions
hostile to the constitutionalist government.

David Lloyd George, the war secre
tary, before parliament Just received
in full in this country. Lloyd George
said:
"It is the practice to communicate
to other departments concerned any
information of matters of public in
terest which may be obtained through
the censorship for such use to be
made of it as the particular depart
ment may consider advisable. The
government is perfectly within its
rights in using any notification which
f-omos to it in this condition for any
purpose and national purpose."
This staj?ment apparently had heen
censored out of cable dispatches to
the United States.' When nsltcd about
the matter tonight. Secretary Lansing
said it had Jjeen called to the atten
tion of the state department officially,
but declined to make any comment
at this time.
It Is understood, however, that the
department will take a more serious
view of Lloyd George's interpretation
and will protest more vigorously than
ever against interference with neutral
mails on the high seas. Although
the American government has con
tended strongly against the wholesale
detentions and seizures of mail be
tween neutral countries, as in viola
tion of international law, so far there
has been no showing of improper
censorship. ,
A brief preliminary note was re
ceived July 20 but it was incon
elusive.

Commission Going About
Work With Extreme Care
Republican A. P. Leased Wire
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 8.
Careful, painstaking labor over the
complicated situation along the Mex
ican border marked todays American
Mexican joint commission conference.
Many schemes for cooperative mili
tary patrol, and for otherwise frustra
ting the outlaw element of northern
Mexico were discussed. None of them
seemed entirely satisfactory and when
the commission adjourned tonight, to
meet again Monday, it was intimated
that a broader plan, incorporating
adaptable features of several of those
which have been presented thus far
might be worked out.
American members did not hesitate
to describe the plan being framed as a
substitute for existing conditions on
the border as its adoption meant the
withdrawal of General Pershing's force
rrom Mexico.
Two of the Mexican commissioners,
Luis Cabrera and Alberto Paul, left
for New York tonight to spend tomor
row attending to special missions with
which they have been changed, by Gen-1
eral Carranza in addition to their work,
on the commission. Dr. John R. Mott
of the American commissioners also
went to New York. .'
The American commissioners are
taking advantage of every opportunity
to learn what the Carranza govern
ment has been doing and in prospect
for the benefit of the war-torn republic.
