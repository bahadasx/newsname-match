Columbia, Sept. 6.^?Xever before in
the history of South Carolina Democ?
racy j baa there been such a meeting
as vaa held here tonight in the inter
eat of the candidacy of former Gov?
ernor Blease. Each of the 4 5 counties
wan represented, and there were re-1
porta from each of a tidal wave which
wiH sweep Blease into office next
Tuesday by an unprecedented ma?
jority.
Mr. Bleaae, Senator McLaurln and

Hon? W. Jasper Talbert, of Edge

of Colombia, was made secretary. In
calling the meeting to order Mr. Tal
bort said he was reminded of the days
of lift, wlien he had the honor to
preside over the memorable March
convention ef that year, "when our
distinguished friend at that time, now
Senator Ttlliaan, was made governor
of Booth Carolina. I lr.d as much

, The county i court house, where the
meeting was held, rang with cheers
which could be heard for blocks
around aa Mr. Blease waa Introduced.
He made what has been described by
those who heard him aa one of the
ablegt addresses during his entire ca?
reer, s
The vote which he received In the
first primary, he said, expressed the
hope' and the faith that the masses of
the people have In the fight which he
la making for them and In the prin?
ciples* which that fight represents. .
He held In his handa the proof, ho
said, that Manning people were at?
tempting to debauch the electorate of
South Carolina by the use of money,
referring to a letter i from Manning
headquarters, but euld that he knew
the election could not be bought, that
the votere of South Carolina were not
for aale, and that the only danger In
which the Blease forces stood would
be an effort to steal the votes after
they were cast.
The letter referred to is aa fellow*:
Sept. 1, 1916.
Dear Sir:
"I am writing you In the Inter?
est of Governor Manning. You
know the results new, and also that
the issue la squanly drawn. It Is
really not a questior of Mr. Manning
or Mr. Blease, but of civilisation. If
you feel that you can go out and do
some work for this cause, please get
In touch with Mr. H. H. Abrains, of
Newberry, and Mr. D. F. EArd, of
Lexington. If we expect to win this
mm
battle, we must take off our coats and
get to work. By hard work, we oan
win. Otherwise, we are going to I
"Tours very truly,
"MANNING' HEADQUARTERS,
"By vV. C. McLaln."
He asked his friends to watch the
count.
The principles for which he stood,
j he said, would be victorious In the
primary next Tuesday, "when ho will
j give to broken down aristocracy the
severest defeat in the history of the
Democracy of the State."
As Mr. Blease sat down, the assem?
blage unanimously called for senator
McLaurln and he responded with an I
uddresa which inspired renewed en* I
thuslasm. "I am not afraid of their
money," he said, "because I have
been out among the people of South
Carolina. They talk about the Coop- I
er vote, they are not even going to be
able to hold the Manning vote. There
are many farmers in South Carolina
who have voted for Manning under a
misapprehension, whoso eyes aro now
being opened, and on next Tuesday
they are going to vote for Blease.

"They are so constructed," said
Epstein, "that they can rise higher)

Alabama Congressman Charges' Re
bulicans With Misrepresenting The
Administration in Presidential Cam?
paign?Calls Chief Executive The
Lincoln of 20th Century*
Raleigh News and Observer.
Washington, Sept. 5.?Representa?
tive Rellin, of Alabama, criticised the
Republicans of the house for making
a party issue of the eight-hour work
day bill for railroad employees: "I
have been unable to find. out why
gentlemen on the Republican side
voted against that measure," de?
clared Mr. Heflln. "The only reason
I con suggest Is that from the Bible,
The ox knoweth his owner and the
ass his master's crib.' The gentle?
man from PennsyB ania (Mr. Moore)
and those like him are mad because
the great Democratic president invit?
ed the trainmen to the White House,
these men with soot on their faces,
and grime on their hands, these sol
! dters of the rail of this country, com?
ing up and sitting down and confer?
ring with this great Democratic presi?
dent. You are so accustomed to star
chamber proceedings and to doing
what the bosses tell you that it struck
you blind when you saw that great
army of trainmen actually go up into
the White House, shake hands with
the president and sit down and talk
with him.
"The gentleman from Pennsylvania
is sad in his soul because the presi?
dent us<p| four pens in signing that
measure and gave those pens to the
heads of the brotherhoods of tho
trainmen. Why should he not ha/e
given the pens to them? He has em?
ployed more pens in more^~>yposcs
in /three years and a half
presidents for five terms all
gether.
"As the gentleman fwom Per
vanla spoke of ??hat l wonderecT'what
Mr. Roosevelt had done with the pen
that he used when he addressed, 'My
dear Harrlman,' and asked him to
come over and read i.ls message to
congress and to see if there was any?
thing In it to which the interests ob?
jected.
"I won dosed what Mr. Roosevelt
did with the pen he used when he
wrote Judge Elbert H. Gary, the head
of the Steel Trust, when he Invited
him over to dls-wss with him the tak?
ing over of the Tennessee Coal and
Iron Company to further boost up his
great monopoly.
"I wondered what Mr. Taft did
with the pen that he used when he
signed Balllngcr's commission as
secretary of the Interior, the man who
was secretly squandering the public
domain of the west to the moneyed
interests of that section.
"I do not know what he did with
the pen that he used when he signed
the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill, includ?
ing schedule K, unless he gave one to
the head of the woolen trust and the
other to captains of industry at
Lawrence,, Mass., where they were
grinding out the lives of little chil?
dren.
"There are other various things
that Messrs. Roosevelt and Taft used
to bad purposes for the people.
"This man Wilson is a man of the
people. The people come to him.
The bankers came for a banking law,
the farmers for a land loan bill and
the manufacturers from every center
if the country urged him to prevent
that strike and he acted for the peo?
ple* The leaders of your party did
all In their power to strike that
measure dead. Your leaders in the
senate did all they could to defeat It.
When the mothers in the cities, the
lives of whose children depended up?
on fresh milk supplied from the
'arms of the country implored the
president to prevent the strike and
save their little ones you and those
like you voted against that meas?
ure. Your party under the present
management, leadership and sub?
serviency has damned and destroyed
its usefulness to the American people.
You have reached the point where
you seek power at the cost of princi?
ple. You are time servers against
the people, and God save the country
from your control again."
Mr. Hellin charged tho Republicans
with misrepresenting the administra?
tion in the presidential campaign.
"You are slandering and traducing
the president," said he. "You are
using money corruptly. You intend
to buy the election in some places and
to obtain it under false pretenses in
Otehere. You appeal to sectional pre?
judice. No sincere patriot, no gen?
uine American citizen, will do any?
thing now to try to disturb the in?

clined, however, to regard the work?
men as having been won over to a
complete change from free trade. One
of the labor leaders of the house of
commons said the meaning of the
resolution was merely that measures
had been taken to investigate the
origin of goods and conditions under
which they are produced with a view
to preventing the unloading of cheap
goods In this country after the war?
