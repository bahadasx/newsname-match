Petrograd.

which have crossed the Dvina river
north of Dvinsk, were attacked re
peatedly by the Germans yesterday,

GERMAN REPORT.
Berlin, Sept. 8. —French and Ger
man troops were again engaged in
Infantry fighting yesterday in the re
gion south of the Somme river in
France, 6ays today's official statement.
The French were repulsed with great
losses with the exception of a point
to the west of Berny, where, the state
ment adds, some portions of trenches
remained in the hands of the French.
WAR SUMMARY.
German troops along the Somme
front last night made repeated efforts
to take back ground won by the
French in their latest advance south
of the river. The struggle over the
ground between Berny and Chaulnes
was marked with unusual violence.
Paris says the German assaults avail
ed them nothing.
On the Verdun front also French
troops were subjected to a counter at
tack, the object of which was to con
quer German first line positions over
a front of nearly a mile northeast of
Verdun, which the French took yes
terday. These efforts were unsuc
cessful, the official French report
says.
British troops on the Somme front
were comparatively inactive. Further
north near Guinchy the British raided
German trenches-.
An official Bulgarian statement of
September 4, dealing with the earlier
phases of the Invasion of eastern Ru
mania, tells of the defeat of the Ru
manians in two engagements and re
ports a successful Bulgarian advance

Senator Lewis, democrat, urged that
if anything should be investigated it

Wilson called attention to the "Help
ful and humane legislation" passed

bers was on hand to watch the session
die. Most of them had hurried to
their homes.
Last night both houses accepted the
conference report on the emergency

awaiting final formalities of the great
est session of congress in many re
spects in history.
In closing addresses while awaiting
the arrival of President- Wilson, refer
ences to the long program of legisla
tive achievement dominated chiefly by
national defense, preparations at a
cost of more than $600,000,000 were
made. Democrats lauded the record
while republicans criticized, alleging
waste and extravagence.
Recapitulation of the nine months'
work showed there had been appro
priated for 1917 for government ex
penditures more than $1,600,000,000
and that authorizations had been
made for future expenditures which
would bring the grand aggregate of
appropriations almost to the $2,000,

European war and imminence at one
time of a diplomatic break with Ger
many interference with American
mails and commerce, invasion of
American soil and killing of Ameri
cans by Mexican bandits, and danger
of actual war with Mexico.

the senate over the nomination of
Louis, D. Brandeis of Boston, to ..suc

CITIZENS MEET TO

Talk of Opening Hospital
at Sunnyslope This Fall
No Decision Reached
All the details for Opening Wapello
county's n?w tuberculosis sanitorlum
are yet to be worked out. This was
decided at a public meeting held
Thursday evening in the oity hall
when repersentatlves from the differ
ent social groups of the city gathered
to talk over the proposition.
The local oomniittee is making prog
ress but has nothing to set out as defi
nitely accomplished. The urgent need
for such an institution prompts the
members to open the sanitorium this
fall but whether this can be accom
plished can not be foretold.
Sunnyslope, a six acre place lying
Just east o* the city limits at the head
of North Walnut avenue, was pur
chased by'the county from W. E). Mul
1
ins for $5,000 about a month ago. This
was done under the "hospital act" of
the last legislature which empowers
supervisors in counties this size to
spend that amount for acquiring, equip
ping and maintaining a sanitorium.
The place is ideally located ftor such
an institution. It lies high and dry
above the river valley and overlooks
a wide tract of rich meadow and farm
land across to the wooded banks of the
Des Moines. It is equipped with an
eight room modern bungalow, a four
room cabin, barns, sheds and chicken
houses, a complete water system and
wind mill.

The president was busy up to the
time of his departure with work in
cident to the adjournment of congress.
After spending an hour at the capitol
signing bills, he returned to the white
house and attached his signature to
many commissions and executive pa
pers.
A staff of secretaries, clerks and
messengers left for Long Branch to
day and will open executive offices
tomorrow at Asbury Park.
DANISH TREATY
PASSES SENATE
Washington, D. C., Sept 8.—Since
the senate approved last night the
Danish West Indies treaty, virtually
the only thing that stood in the way
today of the acquisition of the islands
by the United States was the ratifica
tion of the treaty by the parliament of
Denmark, the lower house of which
has approved it. The Danish parllar
ment has appointed a committee to
consider the negotiations.
The treaty provides for the purchase
of the Danish West Indies for $25,000,
000.
PHILIPPINES BUY

Manila, Sept. 8.—The sale of the
Manila railroad to the Philippine gov

New London, Coon., Sept 8. —At
the resumption here today of the con
ferences of the Mexican-Ame: can
Joint commission seeking a permanent
settlement of the international difficul
ties, it was regarded as probable that
before this afternoon's deliberations
were concluded the Mexican delegates
would make a formal request for the
withdrawal of Gen. Pershing's puni
tive expedition from Mexican terri
tory.
Papers bearing directly upon this
phase of the situation were studied
yesterday by the American commis
sioners.
Ideas relative to the maintenance of
order along the border were exchang
ed today. With Franklin K. Lane
heading the American delegation pre
siding, the commissioners engaged in
a discussion whioh was expected to
result in progress toward a better un
derstanding of the objects In view.
STREET CAR MEN
LOSING 111 STRIKE
New York, Sept. 8.—With subway
and elevated trains being operated
apparently on normal schedule, trac

York's strike has been broken. Fifty
per cent of the "green cars" of the
New York Railway company's surface
system were running, the company an
nounced, and police department re
ports Indicated that the walkout was
not having a widespread effect. Union
leaders claimed at noon that 8,500 men
were on strike on the subway and ele
vated roads and 4,000 on the "green
car" system.
Theodore P. Shonts, president of the
Interborough, said all of the men who
have struck on the New York Railway
lines, owned by the Interborough,
could have their positions back with
their former places of seniority restor
ed if they resigned from the union by

In Oklahoma and Kansas much of

been caused by unfavorable weather.
Much of the principal corn area of the
country has failed to receive suffioient

In North Dakota corn will be most
