terest in "Fire Appliances."
There arc citizens who bellevo that
It la contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many of the
public offices In one community In
the possession of members of a dingle
family.
The threats mado by members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business impelled this news
paper to ferret out just what grasp
the Connerya have on public affairs.,
The result is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and tho
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang of
public payroll ornaments believe that
they can uso the United States Gov
ernment in their business.
They evidently have found the
State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City of Chicago
Very profltablo and easily worked
attachments to the family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
lng why all of the public Jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be due to the fact that there
are not enough Connerys, to go around.
Connerya First!
What a noble family motto that is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connerya and their well
known' hankering for gooff' things.
"State Street Store" Blocki aa you
may have heard him referred to, a
partner of John T. Connery In the coal
business, is a member of the Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds the nice-salaried
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Blocki.
Fartnor Blocki will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good Btorios of city1 contracts and
of other contracts In which tho Con
nery connections were alleged to have
boon interested aro not so far forgot
ten that tho public interest in them
ever wholly died out.
Thero was a number of talented
Democratic leadors who held ofllco or
contracts under the Busso BUSINESS
administration.
We havo referred to some of tbeso
worthies before as our flies will at
test. But talking of the Bubbo BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
It about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that some members of tho Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunno in 1907 whon
he was running for ro-olectlon.
Although looked upon by' many in
the light of tho Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
if not to all, of the Jobs In its gift,
tho Connory's aro alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great.
When John W. Rainey, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk of the Circuit Court
tn 1912, the Connery outfit fought
him- at the polls In favor of Joseph'
E. Bidwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Sweltzer was run
ning for the Democratic nomination
for Mayor In 1915, the Connerya saw
another chance to put a member ot the
family In that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of. the
Sanitary District of Chicago.
But the Democratic stomach was
showing signs of balking at .an over
diet of Connery and the noble Francis
D. was sent back to the payroll to
wait for another chance.
Swoltzer got the nomination and It
is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
one of tho princes of the blood and
were not over-enthuslastlo for Swelt-
zer's election Jto say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph E. Bid
will, Jr.,' son-in-law of John T. Con
nery will not seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Rainey. the present
efficient Democratic Incumbent of that
office.

WHYTHEYNAMEDHOYNE
Tho question is often asked, "Why
did tho gang endorse Hoyne for
State's Attorney?"
Tho gang calls Itself a "Tammany."
Well, If offering copperplate Induce
ments for Trust Press help consti
tutes a "Tammany," the name Is not
misused.
If giving up tho goods every tlmo
an officer ot tho law looks cross, Is
"Tammany," this faint-hearted gang
Is "Tammany."
Hoyne certainly asked for no favors
from this crowd.
He fought It and beat It all tho way
from the primary to the National Con
vention. Perhaps the best reason given for
tho gang's endorsement of Hoyne aft
er It had talked of naming a number
ot Its friends for Stato's Attorney, In
tho following, told to tho Editor ot
Tho Eaglo by a Domocrat high In tho
"Tammany" crowd. This gentleman
said:
"I was sitting In my office ono day
when (naming a well known Com
mitteeman) camo In and said: 'Wo

Able Chicago Congressman Will
Be Re-elected in the Eighth
District.
There Is no doubt about the re
nomlnatlon and re-election ot Con
gressman -Thomas Gallagher In tho
Eighth district. He deserves well ot
tho .people because of the good record
ho has made at Washington.
A primary merely shows the people
what they are up against. The voters
havo a chanco to oven things up at
tho regular election.
VOTE FOB DUNNE
Popular Governor Will Head Democratic
Ticket and Will Be Renominated
at the Coming Primary.
Gov. Edward F. Dunno opened his
Chloago campaign for renomlnatlon
and re-election with a speech, In which
he cut looso from all factional tics and
announced ho Is a candidate on his
record and hla own responsibility.
Gov. Dunno spoke to GOO nctlvo
Democrats In the main banquet room
of Hotel Morrison. Ho made It plain
to them that ho attacks no man or set
of men and urged n big turnout of
Democrats at tho polls on primary
uay as a starter for the November
campaign.
"I feel confident I will bo renomi
nated," Gov. Dunno said, "but thoro
are other candidates for tho same
position. I desire tho nomination from
a largo Democratic primary, not a
small ono, Wc know thero will bo a
large Republican vote because there
Is a bitter campaign on between the
three Republican factions. They aro
talking bitterly, openly, and In some
cases truthfully about ono another."
In reviewing tho work of his ad
ministration the governor emphasized
tho value of tho eight hour rule In
stato institutions, Ho said:
"I may say to President Wilson
when ho proclaims to the laboring
peoplo that we have arrived at a stage
When eight hours constitute a day's
work 1 say, Mr. Wilson, we of tho
state ot Illinois havo put those words
into effect."
Then tho governor told of furthor
reforms in tho stato Institutions, how
tho straltjacket and the muffs anil
straps had been thrown into tho scrap
heap.
In llko manner be told of the re
tonus In tho penitentiary, and Bald:
"Today theee convicts who havo
forfeited- their liberty but, not their
manhood, who have violated our laws
and are paying their debt to tho state,
aro being treated llko human beings."
Gov. ,Dunno, again referring to his
own candidacy, said: "I announco my
candidacy because I did not think I
should quit my friends In tho middle
of this great fight. I try to keep out
of thoso complications downstato bo-
causo I do not think It Is any of my
business to Interfere with tho busi
ness ot other candidates.
"It you do not think my record
clean and progressive I don't want
your vote, but If you think It-Is as 1
think It Is, clenn and honorable, I
want your support."
Governor Edward F. Dunno will bo
renominated by tho Democrats. In an
address to tho public just IsBued, tho
Governor cays:
"During the Forty-eighth general as
sembly, notwithstanding tho fact that
tho Democratic mombers of both
houses were In a minority, I had tho
satisfaction of seeing twelvo of tho
eighteen measures recommended by
mo placed upon tho statute books,"
tho Governor declared.
Following Is tho list of twelve meas
ures which tho Governor says woro
placed on the statute books during his
administration:
Ratification ot "amendment to Fed
eral constitution providing for election
of United States Senators by direct
voto of tbo people.
Tho Public Utilities Commission
law.
Tho law empowering all cities in the
State to own and operate public utili
ties. The law authorizing employment ot

Tho law providing for rotation of
names of candidates for stato offices

Tho law creating tho legislative ref
erence bureau.

omy committee.

nay faro act so as to mako it apply to

commission and providing for tho
building of good roads.
Tho law compolllng corporations to
pay wages soml-monthly.
Tho law consolidating tho fish and
gamo commissions aud reforming tho
abuses of tho old sopurato commis
sions. "In addition to tho above," tho state
ment adds, "I took plcasuro in further
ing tho passage of and signing tho bill
known as tho workmen's compensa
tion net, which rovlsed tho law of 1911,
and which provides, without litigation,
compensation to injured employes for
Injuries sustained In tho courso of
their employment.
"Llkewlso' during my administration
tho Forty-eighth general assembly
passed coal mining laws providing for
greater safety in mining operations
and the establishment of rcscuo sta
tions. It nlso passed tho electric head
light bill and other remedial legisla
tion." PEOPLE ARE
WITH HOYNE
State's Attorney Maclay Hoyno Is
out with a statement announcing his
candidacy for re-election. His plat
form Is to be, ho assorts, tho record ot
his achievements during the last four
years, and on this record ho asks tho
voters to usslst him. His statement
follows:
"I havo decided to bo a candldato
for ro-clectlon ob stato's attorney, and
to that end shall seek a ronomlnatlon
from tbo Democratic party at tho
September primary,
"This conclusion results chiefly
from tho advice and assurances of
support I havo rocolved from over
1,000 citizens ot different political par
ties, who are leaders in business, la
bor, professional and civic affairs.
Thoy Inform mo they will soon elect
officers and organize for an energetic
campaign.
"I regret that the existing election
laws mako it necessary for candidates
for Stato's Attorney and other muni
cipal offices to seek a partisan nomin
ation. National politics and policies,
and politics generally, should have not
tho slightest connection with the of
fice ot Stato's Attorney and such of
fices. Since tho election in 1912 I
have conducted tho Stato's Attorney's
ofllco on this theory. Upon the .rec
ord mado during this period I stand.
"I ask tbo aid and votes of tho vot
ers ot tho Democratic party at tho
Soptembor primary upon that record,
regardless ot tholr previous factional
connections, sympathies or activities.
"My determination to bo a candl
dato Is and will remain, unaffectud by
tho action, desires or wishes of i.ny In
dividual, or group ot Individuals, as
suming to glvo orders to tho mass of
tho party voters of this county or to
myself.
"I feel It necessary to Bay this bo
causo of silly nowspaper articles to
tho effect that certain Democratic
leaders woro organizing a local 'Tam
many,' and that candidates for party
nominations In this county would bo
compelled by a pledge to turn ovor tho
power of appointment nnd other
patronngo of tho offices they sought to
some commlttco or group ot loaders.
"I never havo nor will I ovor sign,
glvo or mnko such a pledge, or any
pledgo whatever other than that I
mako in public to tho voters of Cook
County. I disclaim any intention or
desire, singly or Jointly, to Tammany
Izo any official or prlvato citizen, and
I know that I will permit no ono to
familiarize mo or any ofllco I over
hold or hope to hold."
"I recognize," ho said, "under tho
existing election lows, tho legality and
propriety of each political party choos
ing a county central commlttco, and
.that committees havo certain powers
and duties to perform.
"Although tho nomination of candi
dates for State's Attorney and county
officers generally Is not ono ot the
functions of the county central com
mittee, and although its indorsement
or failure to Indorse binds neither tho
voters ot tho party nor tho -candidate,
I reallzo the county control commit
too, through its reorganization, can
glvo greatest aid to a candldato for
nomination.
"Having this in mind, and subject to
what has boon said above, I shall seek'
tho aid and Indorsement of my candi
dacy for nomination from thovprcsent
duly elected county ccntrnl commlttco
ot tho Democratic party, and hopo,
upon my record in ofllco, I may rccoivo
It.
"1 havo referred to my record In of
fice, so in conclusion let mo say that
this record Is not ono of drastic, harsh
and relentless prosecutions. No pub
lic official or prlvato citizen, minister,
priest or rabbi over asked leniency or
mercy for tho young, Ignorant, poor
or misguided first offender in vain. It
is to tho habitual criminal and be
trayer of public trust nlono that a deaf
car has been turned."
