But Two Cases of Infantile
Paralysis In Entire Conty
There is nothing alarming in the infantile paralysis situation
in this county, although the state quarantine, as far as can be as
certained, is being observed to the letter, especially as it regards
keeping children under 16 years of age away from public gaher
ings of all kinds.
At the present time there are but two cases of infantile par
alsis in the entire county, at least physicians have reported but
two to County Medical Inspector Dr. W. A. Simpson.
The first case reported was that of Luella P. Spencer, aged five
years, of White township, who is said to be recovering slowly. The
other case is Mary Doubt, five-year-old daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
J. R. Doubt, of Pine township. She is said to be holding her own.
Although there is nothing in the local situation to cause
alarm, the precautions which the state has insisted shall be ob
served are wise ones, and their fulfillment will be strictly exacted
by the authorities.
