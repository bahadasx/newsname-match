YOUNG BUSINESS MEN
OF AMERICA TO MEET
INNEWORLEANES.
Advance information received
by the management of the Youug
Men's Branch of the New Orleans
Association o(_Commerce prompts
the belief (hat the attendance at
the annual convention of the
Young Men's Business Club of
America, to be held in New Or
leans October 13 and 14, will be a
record breaker. More than GOO
members from various points have
thus far annouuoed they will at
tend the convention This is the
first time in the history of the
South that a national convention
of young men will assemble to
discuss the business problems of
the nation. While their principal
investigations will be business
and commercial, the relationship
of agriculture to business and the
improvement uf farming and stock
raising methods as connected with
banking and business, will form
one of the most important topics
flt. Louis, A ag
it ejected for enlistment in the
United State« Marine Corps be
cause the "trigger" and middle
fingers were mlneing from hie
right band, Elbert Harlan, a raw
boned applicant from Oklahoma,
went from the recruiting station
in the Fullerton building, to
shooting gallery nearby, and
made twenty five straight hits on
a moving target with a small cali
bre lifle, while the sergeant who
had rejected him looked on.
"I oan shoot better with my lit
tie finger than some men oan with
their trigger fingers", Harlan said
after hia performance at the gal
lery, "and I cannot understand
why yon won't take me."
The Marine sergeant explained
that a hand minus several fingers
would look bad when enoased in
white gloves and that the loss of
the fingers would seriously inter,
fere with the proper handling of
the rifle et drills.
But the Oklahoma recruit was
unoonvinoed and went back home
in the belief that the government
doesn't know a good man when it
sees one.

RACE TRACK
FIGHT HELPS
LIVE STOCK SHOW.
New Orleans, Sept The clash
between the owners of the old and
new race tracks at New Orleans
has brought into prominence the
plans of the old track represented
by the Business Men's Associaton,
for the National Farm and Live
Stock Show to be held at the Fair
Orouuds November 11 to 19 for
which the Business Association
has given $25 000 in cash for pre
miums, in addition to paying all
other expenses ami operating the
show as a public demonstration in
the interest of farming and live
stock raising.
Au attempt was made by out
side interests to compel the Busi
ness Association to buy the City
Park Race Track for $375 000 in
order to get the new comers out
of the way as competitors during
the coining racing season. The
attempt not only met with failure
bat the Business Men's Associa
tion announced, through Dr. (1
A McDiarmid, its president, that
any horse owners or jockeys rac
ing at City Park would find them
selves outlawed by the National
Association
As a consequence the Business
Men's Association is going ahead
with its plans to bold in New Or
leans, immediately following the
Dig State Fair at Shreveport, the
great«*st farm aud live stock exhi
bit ever held in this section of the
couutry. The lamented Louis N
Brueggerhoff. late secretary of
the State Fair, gave the New Or
leans movement Ins active support
aud it likewise has the active sup
port of the commercial and bnsi
uess exchanges aud the women's
clubs of New Orleans.
It is believed that live stock
aud farm products raised in Louis
iana will have an excellent chain o
of taking home with them a con
siderable part of the $25,000 cash
which will be distributed as
prizes. I. B. Bennyson, a promt,
nent business man of New Or
leans who is acting as general
manager for the show, says that
exhibits will come from all over
the country and that he wants the
best Louisiana can produce to de
monstrate to winter tourists aud
capitalists visiting New Orleans
how far Louisiana is advanced in
be movement toward the scienti
0c development of the products of
tbe-farm and pasture.

mouth of June he places on the

full of water. Across the tubs he
puts a six.inch board and on this

and other insects are attracted iu
large uumbers to the bright light,
strike the sides of the lantern, full

He repeats this for several nights,

his field is siugulaTty exempt from
all appearanoes of the boll weevil.
