WILSON PREDICTS TRIUMPH
FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE
In Speeoh Before Annual Convention
of Woman Suffrage Association.
Atlantic City, N. J., Sept. 8. Tri
umph for the woman suffrage cause,
"in a little while" was predicted by
President Wilson here tonight in a
speech before the annual convention
of the National American Woman
Suffrage Association.
"I have come here to fight with
you," the president declared.
Immediately the 4,000 women pres
ent stood and cheered. A few minutes
later Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, honor
ary president of the association, with
Mr. Wilson still present, declared:
"We have waited long enough to
get the vote. We want it now. I
want it to come during your adminis
tration." Again the great audience of women
stood and cheered, waring handker
chiefs. The president's pledge of support to
the suffrage question caused Mrs.
Carrie Chapman Catt, president of the
organization, to say in a speech soon
after he closed:
"You touched our hearts and won
our fealty when you said you had
come here to fight with us."
The president did not speak on the
method by which he would bring
a'bout woman suffrage, but said "We
shall not quarrel in the long run as
to the method."
The woman in their speeches also
failed to mention the question of
method.
The president was warmly applaud
ed before, during and after his speech.
With Mrs. Wilson, he sat during sev
eral addresses. Fears expressed be
fore the meeting that he might be
"heckled" did not materialize. At the
conclusion of his address Mrs. Catt
thanked him for speaking.
LITTLE INTERRUPTION TO
NEW YORK CAR SERVICE
Strikebreakers to be Placed in Place
of Strikers Today.
New York, Sept. 8. The second day
of the strike of unionized employes in
New York's subway and on elevated
railway and surface car lines brought
little interruption to service, but de
veloped a fight which, it was said,
may decide whether the city's carmen
wilLbe permitted to organise.-- The
police quickly put down efforts, at vio
lence in various districts
Theodore P. Shonts, president of the
Interborough Rapid Transit company,
and the New York Railways company,
struck at the union by offering- to
take back all striking New York Rail
ways company employes (surface car
motormen and conductors) who quit
the union by tomorrow. Strikebreak
ers, he declared, would be put in the
places of all th" employes who do
not accept his offer. .:ri-;i:fJSEJ
'union leaaers Lu.trnt threatened to
extend the strike to the lines of the
Third Avenue Railroad company, the
Second Avenue company and the Un
ion Railways company unless the
heads of these lines pledged them
selves not to circulate individual con
tracts among their men similar to
those binding the workers not to ask
for wage increases for two vears,
which brought cn the Interborough
strike and the sympathetic New York
Railways strike. The Third Avenue
line, it was said, flatly refused the de
mands. WILSON CAUSES LAUGHTER

"There are others more handsome by
far
"My face I don't mind it,
"Because I'm behind it
"It's the people in front that I jar."
The president went to the musicale
with Mrs. Wilson not expecting to
speak. He was reminded of the lim
erick, he said, by the request of the
man in charge that he stand up and
allow the crowd t osee his face. He
added, it was a pleasure to hear good

CAUSED BY HOT ANO DRY
WEATHER OF AUGUST
WHEAT CROP IS SHORT
An Unusually Short Output of White
Potatoes for Winter Sup-ply Is Fore
cast Hay and -Tobacco Only Crops
to Show Increase.
Washington, Sept. 8. Heavy dam
age to the country's cereal crops dur
ing August caused a loss of many mil
lions of bushels in prospective pro
duction, cutting down the outlook for
wheat to below the amount required
for home consomption.
The department of agriculture's
monthly forecast, issued today, esti
mates the wheat crop at 611,000,000
bushels, or 9,000,000 bushels less
than is calculated to be necessary for
domestic use.
Loss in Corn Due to Drought.
The heavy loss in prospective pro
duction of corn was due to drought.
In many sections, particularly in Kan
sas and Oklahoma, many fields of
corn were cut for ensilage or fodder.
Persistence, the
Pick up a newspaper or a periodical and you will find that the
advertising columns are occupied day after day by the announcements
of the same business houses, the same manufacturers, the same people
who are anxious to get their of fermgs before the people. There is of
course' a reason for it. To advertise once and then forever keep silBrit
makes but slight impression upon the reading public. To advertise
but occasionally conveys the idea to the public that it is but occa
sionally that they can be interested in trading at such places, but the
advertiser who keeps his business constantly before the people who do
the buying and delivers the goods in accordance with the printed page
makes his place , of business a household word on which the purchaser
comes to depend, and in which, he has confidence.
Persistence is the cardinal virtue in advertising; no matter how
good advertising may be in other respects, it muBt be. run frequently
and consistently to attain the highest degree of success.
To get your business announcements Into the homes and to the

000,000 bushels, which is 22,000, COO
bushels smaller than the average for
the last five years.
Short Output of Potatoes.
An unusually short output of white
potatoes for winter supply is fore
cast. Production of 318,000,000 bush
els is Indicated. That is 4.6,000,000
bushels less than forecast a month
ago and the smallest chop since
1911.
Other losses from the production es.
timates made a month ago are: Oats,
43,000,000 bushels; barley 11,000,000
bushels; buckwheat 1,300,000 bushels;
rice 1.400,000 bushels; cotton 1,100,
000 bales; apples- 3,900,000 barrels and
peaches 3,400,000 bushels.
Hay and Tobacco Prospects Increased.
While cereals all suffered serious
damage during the month, hay and
tobacco prospects increased and the
harvests of those two crops and also
of rice will be record-breaking. There
was an increase of 27,000,000 pounds
in the indicated production of tobacco,
making a crop of 1,224,000,000 pounds
and exceeding the former record of
1910 by 121,000,000 pounds.
Hay production is forecast at 86,
200,000 tons., which is 1,600,000 tons
more than forecasted a month ago
and 1,000,000 tons more than last'
year's record crop.
Record Rice Crop.
Rice, which declined 1,400,000 bush
els from a month ago, promises a
crop of 32,800.000 bushels, which would
be almost 3,000,000 bushels more than
the record crop of last year.

' IN MAINE

Wildly Cheered by Audience at Ban
gor When He Told of the Exactions
of the Plain People Brass Bands,
Crowds and Parades.
Bangor, Me., Sept. 8. Maine "e.odl-'
ences from Lewiston to Eangor today
heard Charles E. Hughes assail thei
administration for "surrender of force" i
in the enactment of the Adamson law.
The nominee ended the second dayi
of his Maine campaign with an ad- ;
dress in the auditorium here tonight, ;
in which he brought his audience to j
its feet with prolonged applause and j
cheers, by ' a declaration that the!
American people would never give up
government by law and reason, won '
at the oest of continuous fighting. .'
The Plain People. ;
"Look at the history of the past,"
he said, "and of its majestic spectacle
of the people coming down the long
path. Now they are defeated ; now
they are victorious, but still they,
come on, the plain people. They come l
slowly on, winning their way, crush-!
ing out every form of tyranny, de-!
stroying autocracy, securing the right1
to choose their own representatives,1
winning representative government
till here in America we have the finest :
demonstration the world has ever j
known of government by law and rea
son. :
"Shall we give it up? Never;
never." - ,
Audience Waved Flags.
The audience rose, waved hundreds
of small American flags, cheered and'
applauded. It was two minutes before
the demonstration ended.
In all his four addresses today at
Lewiston, Waterville, Pittsfield and
here the nominee made his attack on
the administration in connection with
the Adamson law, one of his chief
themes. Crowds turned out at each:
place to hear him and cheered and
applauded. In his last speech here
tonight, the nominee told his audience
that he felt sure of a republican vio
tory in both tho state and nation.
. Brass Bands, Crowds, Parades.
It was a day of brass bands,
crowds, parades, a torchlight proces
sion and, after reaching Bangor, rain.
Notwithstanding the latter, white
coated paraders tramped through the
streets tonight, their torches lighted
and red fire burning. Led by a brass
band, they were still parading through
the mud an hour after the last of he
crowd which filled the auditorium had
filed out and the doors had been
closed.
Hughes Somewhat Tired.
Mr. Hughes stood the unusual strain
of fast campaigning well and tonight
was feeling somewhat tired but, as he
said, "never better." He is spending
tonight in Bangor and will leave to
morrow for Augusta and the last day
of the state campaign. It will be the
most strenuous of his tour. .
In his speeches today Mr. Hughes,!
in addition to discussing the Adamson;
law, outlined his views on the tariff,
preparedness, Americanism, efficiency,
of government, a world court and oth-'
er republican policies. He also re
viewed his record as governor of New;
York in connection with labor legis--lation,
declared that he was the friend
of labor and would be the first to, give
higher wages were the demand for
higher wages found to be just after an !
examination of the facts, but added
that he would first investigate the
facts.
EXTENSION OF BRITISH
MAIL CENSORSHIP
Is Defended in Statement Issued by.
David Lloyd George.
Washington .Sept. 8. Extension of
the British mail censorship from its
original purpose of destroying a!!
trade to or from Germany to the field
of providing data for Great "Britain's
fight for commercial supremacy is
seen here in admissions made by Da
vid Lloyd George, the war secretary,
before parliament, just received in full
in this country. Lloyd George said:
"It is the practice to communicate
to other departments concerned any.
information on matters of public in
terest .which may be obtained through
the censorship for such use to bo
made of it as the particular depart
ment may consider advisable.
Ths government is perfectly within
its rights in using any information
which comes to it in these conditions
for any publio and national purpose."
This statement, made recently in re
sponse to questions by members of
the house of commons, created a stir
there. It apparently had been cen
sored out cf cable despatches to the
United States. When asked about
the matter tonight. Secretary Lansing
said it had been called t the atten
tion of the state department officially
but declined to make any comment at
this time.
It is understood, however, that the
department will . take a most serious
view of Lloyd George's interpreation
of the British war office power and
will protest more vigorously than
ever - against in-ference with neu
tral mails on the high seas.
