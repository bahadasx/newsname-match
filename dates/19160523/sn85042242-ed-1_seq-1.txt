.William Ostermann, Home­
steader Near Hebron, Shot
by Fred Winters,
the Scene.
Hebron, »X. D., May 22.—William
Ostermann, a young homesteader,
was shot and instantly killed Monday,
at the .lack Crowley ranch, 22 miles
northeast of Hebron, by Fred Win­
ters of Golden Valley.
There was a dispute over 10
which Winters contended Ostermann
owed him. Winters had ridden to the
Crowley ranch to collect the money.
He found Ostermann helping Crowley
in the erection of a rural telephone
line and .began to make his demands
for the money.
Shoots Him Dead.
Ostermann paid little attention to
his remarks, continuing his work.
Suddenly Winters drew a .32 caliber
revolver from his hip pocket and,
pushing Ostermann slightly a^ay
from him, shot him in the left side.
Ostermann sank to the ground with­
out a word and was dead within a
lew minutes.
Attempted to Escape.
The murderer then attempted to
escape, covering Mr. Crowley and Pat
Costello, another hired man, with his
gun while backing toward his horse.
While Winters was mounting, 'Crow­
ley ran into his house and, securing
his Winchester rifle, covered Winters
and held him while Costello sum­
moned the authorities over the tele­
phone. Deputy Sheriff Thomas Fig
enskau of 'Golden Valley arrived in
two hours and took Winters to Gold­
en Valley. From there he will be
taken to the jail at Stanton.,
OiteriVtann Well.. Liked i
OatermanO Wfls' about 24 years of
age and came to Hebron about four
years ago, from IHancock, Minn. He
worked at odd jobs on the Crowley
ranch and also on the Schaffner place
He was single, not quarrelsome and
well thought of by his neighbors.
Winters is comparatively unknown
in this part of the country.
Coroner ^Eastman of Ha/.en was
summoned. He will conduct an in­
quest at the Crowley place.

Washington, May, 22—rRear Admir­
al Caperton, at Santo Domingo, is tak­
ing steps to, distribute his force of
lAmericao marines to various points
in the.Uttle republics, and before they
are withdrawn some arrangement will
he made whereby American officers
will be placed in charge of the con­
stabulary.
The broadening out of the marine
patrol the officials indicated today is
a step preliminary to establishment
of a policing system, similar to that
recently inaugurated in Hayti under
the new Haytian treaty.
American Minister Russell report­
ing today that the marines would
soon be distributed to strategic points
in the republic and said he received
many requests for such action In the
interest of the sugar plantations.
American warships are already sta­
tioned at most important points.
Will Not Recognize Carvajal.
It was made clear at the State De­
partment today that there was no in­
tention of recognizing the election of
Frederico H. Carvajal, chosen pro­
visional governor of Santo Domingo
last week by the Dominican congress
as valid.
Mr. Russell reported that Enrique
Henriquez, former foreign minister,
was on his .way to Washington to
urge Carvajavs recognition.
The Department holds that the im­
peachment of President Jiminez was
only a political coup and already has
informed the Dominican Congress
that the proceedings cannot be rec­
ognized as legal.

EDITH CAIN KILLED
Children Hear Conversation
The shooting occurred in (he hall
of the Cain home. The couple were
alone, Mrs. Cain's four children being
in an adjoining room. They were
able to repeat to the police a portion
of the conversation between their
mother and Smith, in which Smith
sought 1o make up with her, sue re­
jecting his proposals.
Parents of Deserted Baby
Halaciousness is added to Smith's
story by his declaration that the
baby found on the doorstep of the
J. Nelson Kelly home here over a
year ago, was his and Mrs. Cain's
child, and that he, Cain, placed the
baby on the step. The story had
been given to officials previously by
iSmith, hilt Mrs. Cain had denied the
assertions.

Police.
of
Grand Forks, N. D., May 22—Harry
•Smith shot and killed Mrs. Mary Cain,
the mother bf four children, here at
5:in o'clock yesterday afternoon, and
last night the murderer signed a full
confession of the shooting, declaring
it had been his intention to slay Mrs.
Cain and then kill himself. Two
shots entered the woman's right
breast, anl she died in five minutes.
Edith Cain, aged 16, eldest daugh­
ter of Mrs. €ain, by attacking the
man after he had shot her mother,
frustrated the man's attempt at sui­
cide, knocking the revoiver to the
floor, the chamber falling out.
Gives Himself Up
By the time Smith recovered pos­
session of the chamber, he had calm­
ed down and walked from the house
to the police station, meeting two po­
lice officers at the door, they having
been called out by a belated warn­
ing given by Smith's roommate that
there was trouble brewing.
Jealousy over Perry White of Min­
neapolis is the cause set forth by
Smith lor his action. All had been
happiness between the couple until
White entered the scene, and there­
after Smith was not in Mrs. Cain's
good graces.
Met at Bismarck

tel Dacotah, and Smith met at Bis

The Austrians, for their offensive,

The charges of attempted bribery
and jury tampering in the interests of

ond trial, and these allegations will

New York, May 2?—Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite, the young dentist and
tennis player, who was placed on
trial here today before Justice Clar
enc J. Shearn and a jury in the crim­
inal branch of the Supreme Court,
charged with the murder of his weal­
thy father-in-law, John E. Peck, of
Grand Rapids, Michigan, not only ad­
ministered deadly disease germs and
poison to his victim, but applied
chloroform to his nostrils until he
died, it was alleged by District At­
torney Swann in his opening address
for the state.
The trial was begun shortly after
ten o'clock and moved rapidly. A
jury was selected in less than three
hours and the district attorney con­
sumed only half an hour in his for­
mal presentation of the state's case,
aside from the address of the dis­
trict attorney, the outstanding feature
of the trial today was the testimony
of Dr. A. D. Moore.
ARE HOPEFUL
Washington, May 22—Friends of
Louis D. Brandeis were more hopeful
tonight than they have been for many
weeks that his nomiantion to the Su­
preme Court would be favorably re­
ported to the Senate by the Judiciary
committee next Wednesday, when the
committee has agreed to vote.
Some Democratic senators predict­
ed that the vote in the committee
would be nine to eight, for a report
recommending confirmation, count­
ing on the absence of Senator Shields,
Democrat, who is in Tennessee. Eight
Republicans on the committee will
vote solidly against Mr. Brandeis.
Mr. Culbertson, chairman of the
committee, made public today a let­
ter from Dr. Chas. Elliott, president
eremitus of Harvard, urging confirm­
ation.

Makes Brusque Demands
Columbus, New Mexico, May 22—1
Cavalry returning here today from
far southern marches brought news
of brusque demands made on them by
General Cavazos, the Carranza of­
ficer, in command of several thous­
and men, now policing the sections
of Chihuahua from PSrcal, northward
to San Antonio.
The demands were made on the
llth cavalry, in command of Major
Robert L. Howze, a few days aso.
This cavalry, after annihilating halt
of a large band of Villistas at Ojos
Azuleves, was rescued south of San
Antonio, making ready to clean up
the rest of the bandits.
Demands Return of Corn
For the first week after their de­
feat, these Villistas never reappeared
in groups of more than four and the
Americans played a waiting game.
General Cavazos demanded from Oen*
eral Howze, the corn which the Am­
erican troops had seized from the de­
feated Villisatas. Next, the Carran­
za leader demanded that he be given
the horses, which the Americana had
taken. He was notified that any prop­
erty would be paid for in full, but
that the money would he SiTen to the
original owner of the property.
Finally, General Cavazos demanded
that the Americans retreat north­
ward. This was flatly refused.- The
Carranza commander then requeatod
permission to march past* or, through
the American positions to consoli­
date his commands with reinforce'
ments, and this was granted.
Mostly Boys
The Americans were brought VP
on the crest of a hill, when tho Car*
ranzistas marched past. A bearded
American soldier, father of a funlly,
who watched them, said today:
"I am sure that half of that
