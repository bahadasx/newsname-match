StublKjrn IlCAlstAnce,
The German resistance at some
points was stubborn. On the Froide
Terre road and at Douaumont the
?rench had to force back the Ger
man Infantry inch by inch at the
point of bayonets. The leading
French contingent reached Douau
mont at 5 p. m. They killed the Gor.
mans who resisted and sent to the
rear a largo number of prisoners.
As soon as they recovered from
their surprise the Germans launched
a number of fierce counter attacks,
but all failed, and by 10 p. m.
preparations had been made to deal
with the serious effort the Germans
are expected to make to recapture
the lost position.
German Lino Shaken.
The French success is considered
by military critics here to have
shaken the whole German line at
Verdun. Douaumont fort was the
most Important point capturcd by the 1
Germans and the French gain there
Is regard as having nullified the most
significant achievement of the Ger
mans In the great battle of three

CONSERVATION CONGRESS STANDS FOR DEVELOPMENT

PKiSroEA/T. NATIONAL CON?E.KVAT!OM 0aNG*?.S5~ ?vWA.tE.k: HO\f EK OAM ?* CONSTROtTIC*
WASHINGTON ? ( Special)?Pri
vate industrial development of the
great -water power resources of the
United States was emphatically en
dorsed by the National Conservation
Congress, which has just come to a
dose in this city. After a stormy
three hours' debate, the Congress,
the great conservation body of tho
country, recorded its official approval
of this principle by a voto of three to
one.
The spectacular feature of the
fight was the turning down of Clif
ford Pinehot by the Conservation
Congress, of whose executive com
mittee he was a member. Pinehot
charged that the Congress wis pack
ed and was met with the declaration
that his charge ?as an insult to
every governor, mayor and chamber
of commerce president, who had been
invited to appoint the delegates
which made up the meeting. The re
sult of the debate?the endorsement
of the Shields and Myers water
power bills?is taken by the mem
bers to mean that the big conserva
tion body had grown tired of m
tyhg-up of the country's resources
and was ready and anxious to put
itself on record on these specific
legislative measures providing for
development of resources.
The development of water power,
which conservationists recognize as
the greatest natural resource the
country has, has bcon brojglit almost
to stagnation by the failure of legis
lation looking to its development.
Business men with capital have stood
ready to start on the hazardous un
dertaking of harnessing groat rivers
in order to provide clieaper power
and light, as well ts cheaper fertil
izers for the farmer and a gronter
supply of explosives for our army
and navy, through the new process of
taking nitrogen from the air by
means of water power. They have
been met with the cry of "trust" and
"monopoly," until, as business men,
they were nlmost ready to abandon
their efforts. The action of the Con
servation Congress, however, in plac
ing its stamp of approval on a plan
to permit private industry to go
ahead and develop vrater powers, un
der a limited franchise and carefully
governed restrictions, is regarded as
le most important step to water
power conservation that has been
made in recent years.
Such men as Hugh L. Cooper, the
engineer of international reputation
who built the Keokuk dam as well as
big water power plants at Niagara
and on the Susquenunna Kiver, nave
been prominent in the power fight.
The President and members of hii
Cabinet and members of Congress,
without regard to political affilia
tions, have been advocating strongly
th* necessity of legislative action
that wlU put an end to a stagnation
in the development of this wonderful
resource. Almost every other nation
of any size, it has been pointed out.
is ahead at America in the use of
water power. This fact, it Is snid,
coupled with the growing <V>mnnd of
tho people of tho United States that
something bo done so that the coun
try can utilize, as well as conserve,
this vast resource, !b regarded as tha
basis of the decisive action by the
Conservation Congress.
The meeting was made up of
prominent experts in both federal
and state governments, senators and
representatives and prominent men
from practically every state in the
Union. Dr. Henry S. Drinker, presi
dent of Lehigh University, was chair
man of the committee on resolutions,
which Included a governor of a state,
several senators, and other men of
affairs from forty-two states.
YOUNG WOMAN'S
ASSOCIATION
IN INDIA
Is fcf the Earnest, Zealous Kind
and Should Impress Clarks
burg People.
To the ordinary travelor Delna bun
In India in Uie million which marks
the end of a long railway Journey and
the place to get a good breakfast after
a long fnst. What a different signlfi
cance this "Valley of the Tents" has
to about Lhlrty Indian women students
and a few others. They were not or
dinary travelers. They were delegates
to the Young Woman's Christian
Association conference for North In
dia students. Turning aside from the
main road they reached the American
Presbyterian Girls' School, where the
conference was to be held for Ave days.
The teachers and students of the
girsi' high school were the hostesses.
They had made evory effort for the
comfort of the gueBts. The program
was varied. Each day provided Just
what waB needed. Bible clasess fol
lowed by mission study classes began
the day. Ono girl said, "That which
helped me most was the study of
Amoa. Wo learned that although he
was only a herdsman, yet God pre
pared him for a great work; so even If
we are not in a high position, God has
a calling and a work for ub in H1b
Kingdom If we are willing."
Another girl said, "The thing that
Impressed me most was that our leader
said we could always do some mission
ary work In everything." All the large
meetings were held In the mission
church. Leading from this "little
church In the woods" was a violet
edged path to the bungalow of the
"head of the miBsion." It was here
that they held their fireside gatherings
each night after supper. They sang
hymns sometimes, followed by a talk.
There was recreation, without which
no Young Woman's Christian Asso
ciation conference would be ideal.
There were inter-school tournaments,
and one whole afternoon was set aside
aa Tamaska day, or stunt day.
The campflre song was sung with
great gust, but the flres of genius
flamed brighter In the dining room
between courses, when extempore
songs were sung in praise of every
thing In general. No one could forget
the beauty of the sunrise meeting on
the roof on Sunday morning. Through
the tree tops could be seen the sun
rising over the distant hills as they
sang "Holy! Holy! Holy!" and "Still.
Still with Thee when Purple Morning
Breaketh."
The last evening as they gathered
around the Are for the farewell meet
ing the question was asked: "What
has Jcsuh Christ thought of this con
ference?" Thoy wcro all of ono mind.
I It had been a time of fellowship and
real blessing. Thoy realized clearly,
however, that, the One who had been
with them throughout now looked to
them to transfer Into service that
which they had received.
The national organization shares In
the establishment and development of
the movement In other countries, par
ticularly mission lands. It provides
secretaries of training by securing
their support either from Individuals
cr associations In this country and by
contributions to the general work.
The primary purposo is always to
prepare the women of the country for
leadership. The foreign secretary's
work Is measured not by what she
does, but by what she makes It possible
for the women to do for themselves.
Forty-seven secretaries have gone out
from the United States to participate
In foreign Young Woman's Chrlstlun
Association work. The secretaries in
which the world's Young Woman's
Christian Association work Is now be
ing carried on arc North, South. West
