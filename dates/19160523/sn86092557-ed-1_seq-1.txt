FRENCH SURPRISE GERMANS BEFORE VERD
.Trading Him Off In Effort
To Save Glover's Polit
ical Life.
Threatens to Take the
. Shrievalty Nomination
From Glover.
tr;
For several days there has been I
an unusual amount of activity among
certain of the more prominent Mar
lon county Democrats and tliOBe who,
are familiar with the inside history'
[ of that party felt that when such |
worthies put their heads together it I
was reasonable to assumo that a deal j
was on and that most of the dealing!
was being done from the bottom of the
deck.
At first the politicians involved were
unusually successful in preventing
their plans from becoming public
property but since the beginning of
this week enough has leaked out to i
make it reasonably certain that if
the friends of Jim Davis, who is anxi
ous to succeed himself as county as
sessor, do not look sharp they will
wake up the morning after the prim
ary to find that their candidate, who
^ ^hfTiPnlar and w,th th0 Party rank
hJlo is porhaps the strongest of
emocratir; candidates, haB been
.'it in an effort to make Glover
^gj^mocratlc nominee for sheriff.
^"""uTover's situation In the present
campaign Is both ticklish and pecu
liar. For soveral years It has been
f regarded as settled that he would
t>4 the party nominee for shoriff this
year. Even so late aB a week before
the close of nomination filing this
was regarded as settled. Then late
on the final Saturday Smith tossed
hid hat into the ring and the Demo
crtlc machine began to have t/oubles,
for It was realized at once that every
thing telse being equal Smith was the
j better vote getter of the two.
The developments of the primary
campaign have strengthened this early
opinion, and the bosses who were in
on the dea. by which the nomination
was promised to Glover tropi begin
ning to wondor how they are going
to make good have become desperate.
The sacrifice of Davis Is part of their
plan to put Glover across. There are
other details, of course, but this is
the big thing. How successful they
will be depends upon what the Davis
and the Smith people can do between
this and the primary. Had thA Demo
cratic bosses been able to keep their
crooked plans absolutely secret until
the election there is not the slightest
doubt that both Davis and Smith would
have been found among the also rans
when the vote counted. Even as mat
ters now stand Davis and Smith will
have to work hard to undo the dam
age that has been done to their fences.

Chain of Evidence Against
Him Tightened Link
by Link.
NEW YORK,'May 23.?The chain of
evidenco by which tho prosecution
hopes to send Dr . Arthur Warren
Waite the young New York dentist to
the electric chair for the murder of his
woalthy father-in-law John E. Peck
was tightened link by link today by an
array of winesses whose testimony
was remarkable for its directness.
From the druggist who sold Waite
the arsenic with which he already has
confessed that he poisoned his 72 year
old father in law to the physician who
afterwards examined the body as well
as tho undertaker who buried it thero
was an unbroken line of corroborative
evidence as viewed by the prosecu
tion.
The organs of tho aged victims body
preserved in glass jars were showed
to the jury. Waite pale and visibly un
nerved hung his head and gazed al
most continuously at floor. His httn
erto apparently disinterested demea
nor had completely, left him and when
recess was announced at 1 o'clock was
led from tho court room across tho
"Bridge" of sighs to his cell with fal
tering step.
To add to tho prisoners discomfort
Mrs. Margaret Horton his "studio"
companion who according to the dis
trict attorney will play a conspicuous
part in the trial appeared and occu
pied in tho rear of court room. Waite
had to pass directly in front of her
when he was taken from the court
room.
A jury was selected in less than
three hours yesterday, the district at
torney consumed only half an hour
in his formal presentation of the
state's case. Meantime. Waite, who
was neatly dressed in a blue suit and
sat by his counsel, appeared as much
unmoved as the most disinterested
spectator in tho court room.
Asido from tho address of tho dis
trict attorney, in which ho recited
Waite's life history, and gave a com
plete resume of the circumstances
leading up to the crime to which
Waite already has confessed, the out
standing feature of the trial was tho
testimony of Dr. Albertus Adair Moore
Waite, the witness declared, admitted
to him he had purchased arsenic for
his 72-year-old father-in-law "because
the old gentleman didn't want to live."
Previously, when suspicion first was
directed to Waite, Dr. Moore said, the
accused dentist had telephoned to him
and asked him if he (Dr. Moore)
thought "they could hold him (Waite)
for the death of Mr. Peck because a
nurse had not been engaged to attend
the aged victim.
"Waite asked me," said Dr. Moore,
"If arsenic administered before death
would show In autopsy as distinguish
ed from the same poison when used
In embalming fluid."
The witness said he replied that
the poison would bo discernable in
the brain if administered before death.

It Occupied Whole Morning
in Judge Vincent's
* Court.
The entire morning In Intermediate
court today was taken up with bear
ing the argument in the case of Ada
V. Preston against Coyd'H. Duncan.
This is a suit in equity and the dif
ference concerns a sum of money due
on a piano sold by Duncan to the
Preston fatally. The present litiga
tion arose over a judgment granted
seven years ago by a Justice of the
Peace in an , action to recover on the
piano contract what Duncan alleged
was duo -biro; ? An- injunction was
.the death of her husband by Judge
Morgan who was then on the Inter
mediate bench, restraining Duncan
from selling the piano for payment
of hiB judgment. It seems that Dun
can who is familiarly known as "Doc."
has been reading up on the law and
found grounds that he thought suffi
cient to justify a review of the in
junction proceedings with a view to
have it adjudged void. Attorney C.
H. Leeds appeared for the plaintiff
while "Doc" was his own advocate,
Htanding on the constitutional right of
every man to plead his own case.
The argument on either side was
earnest and able, that of Duncan be
ing especially eloquent and bristling
with points. Mr. Duncan's chief con
tention was that owing to a technical
ity, which he explained clearly, Judge
Morgan had exceeded his jurisdiction
in granting the injunction and had
meddled with "Res Judicata" which
he should not have done.
"Res Judicata" whatever it is, is
thoroughly protected by the statutes
of the great State of West Virginia
and should hot be molested during the
closed season. Attorney Leeds at-,
tempted to ridicule Duncan's argument
by reducing it to the absurd. He gave
citations as far back as the very be
ginnings of our common law. "Doc"
however stoutly maintained his
"points" and refused to be ridiculed.
In length and carrying ability of his
argument the assembled spectators
and members of the bar gave "Doc"
the honors. Judge Vincent took the
case under advisement and will ren
der a decision at ten o'clock tomor
row.

Great Rejoicing in Paris Over the Effect of General Ni

Valor.
(By Associated Press) 1
PARIS, May 23?Fighting continued
with extreme violence on both sides
of the Meuse along the Verdun front
during the whole night. Two German
counter attacks on French positions
on Hill 304 failed completely, the war
office announced this afternoon.
The French made further gains with
In Fort Douamont, the Germans now
holding only a small angle on the
northeastern corner of the fort
The battle around Hill 304 was es
pecially severe. In attacking French
positions on the west side of the hill
the Germans UBod liquid gas, the of
ficial statement says, and penetrated
one of the French trendhes but were
dislodged at once.
On the east side of tho hill the Ger
mans attacked after intense artillery
preparations but were not permitted
to reach the French lines.
Tho principal fighting east of the
Mouse was in the Bection between
Thiaumont and Douaumont. The Ger
mans attacked in mass formation and
are said to have suffered enormous
losses. The succeeded in reoccupying
one of the trenches north of Thia
mont farm which had been captured
by the French.
Recapture by the French after 3
months of the greater part of Fort
Douamont \tfhich was taken by the
Germans at the outset of their Verdun
drive Is received with great elation by
the^,press and, public, the more so on
account of the effect' expected to
have on neutral opinio^.
General Nivelle the French com
mander at Verdun took advantage of
tho fact that the Germans recently
have been concentrating all their at
tention on Dead Man Hill on the other
side of the river and assembled a
large amount of artillery for the at
tack on the Douaumont section.

22 and London 23.?Austrian troops
continue to reduce the outer girdle of
forts protecting Arslero. The arm>
of the Austrian crown prince is fol
lowing up the advantage gained on
Friday when the first breech was made
in the line to the northwest of the
for and which enables the Austrians
to attack some of the outer positions
eastward if the place from both front
and rear.
The commanding hills of Tonnezza
and Parso Delia, Vena and Monte Mel
ignone fell in rapid succession bring
ing the Auslro Hungarians in posses
sion of the entire line from Forni on
the.river Astlco westward to the fron

Further advances have been made
by tho Austrians toward the line of
hills north of the Val di Ilaghi on the
highest of which one of the chief forts
of Arsiero is located. Oter important
work protecting Arsiero now threat

Both wings of the Crown Prince's
army also have been going steadily
ahead. The right or west wing
stormed Col. Santo its self and already
Is proceeding against Monte Pasuvlo.
The left wing stormed Saso Alto the
commanding 1/11 of the Armentara
ridge thus depriving the Italians of
their last supporting position or! this
ridge and enabling the Austro-Hungar
lans to advance In to the Sugana val
ley and take Roncegno.
Te guns already captured include
16 28-centimetre howitzers.
The Austro-Hungarlans are battling
against many disadvantages in rough
Alpin territory against strongly for
tified positions but thus far have de
feated their opponents both in open
field and in the assaults on the for
tifications. The correspondents here
declare that t he artileTy of the Aus
tro-Hungarlans has exhibited marked
superiority over that of Italians. Avia
tors havo contributed greatly to the
result of the batle by a successfully
bombing of Italian railways and oth
