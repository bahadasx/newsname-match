': Intense Fighting Around 304.
' The battle around Hill 304 was

positions on the west side of the
hill the Germans used liquid gas, the
official statement says and ipenetrated

dislodged at once. On the east side
of the hill the Germans attacked after
intense artillery preparation but were
not permitted to reach the French
lines.
It The principal fighting east of tho

I "In the region of Verdun the battle
continued with extreme violence all
! last night on both banks of the

r counter attaoks against all our posl-
tlons at Hill 304 resulted in complete

FORT DOUAUMONT
Press and Public Greatly
Elated Over Victory After
Three Months Fighting.
GEN. NIVELLE'S STROKE
Assembles Great Amount of
Artillery and Carefully
Trained Infantry for At

Paris, May 23, 5:45 a. m. Recap
ture by the French, after three
months, ot the greater part of Fort
Douamont which wan taken hv Mir
Germans at the outset of the lr Ver
dun drive, Is received with great ela
tion by the press and public, the
more so on account of tho effect It
is expected to have on neutral opin
ion. General. Nivelle, tho French com
mander at Verdun, took advantage of
the fact that the Germans recently
have been concentrating all their at
tention on Dead Man's hill on the oth
er side of the river and assembled a
large amount of artillery for the at
tack on the Douaumont sector.
On Sunday General Nivelle began a
heavy artillery attack on Fort Douau
mont and adjacent positions. The
hour fixed for the Infantry assault
waB 4:30 p. m. yesterday. When the
moment came French Infantry which
had been carefully selected and train
ed began the advance Blnging the
"Marseillaise."
German Resistance Stubborn.

'who resisted and sent to the rear a
large number of prisoners
As soon as they recovered from
their surprise, the Germans launched
a number of fierce counter attacks
but all failed and by 10 p. m. prep
arations had been completed to deal
with the serious efforts the Germans
are expected to make to capture the
lost positions.
The French success Is considered
by military critics here to have shak
en the whole German line at Verdun.
Douaumont fort was the most import
ant point captured by the Germans
and the French gain there is regard
ed as having nullified the most slgni
cant achievement of the Germans in
the great battle of three months.
West of the Meuse Hill 295, the
western summit of Dead Man hill, has
become no-man's land, like Hartman's

abandoned it temporarily to avoid use

Austro-Hungarian Press Headquart
ers, Monday May 22, via Berlin. May
22, and London, May 23, 320 p. m.
Austrian troops continue to reduce the
outer girdle of forts protecting Ar
siero. The army of the Austrian
crown prince is following up the ad
vantage gained on Friday when the
first breach was made in the line to
the northwest of the fort and which
enabled the Austrians to attack some
of the outer positions eastward of the
place from both the front and rear.
The commanding hills of Tonnezza,
Parso Delia Vena and Monte Melig
none, fell in rapid succession, bringing
the Austro-Hungarians in possession
of the entire line from FornI on the
river Astlco. westward to the frontier, j
Further advances have been made
by the Austrlans toward the line of
hills north of the Val dl Ilaghl. on the
highest of which one of the chief forts
of Arslero is located. Other import
ant works protecting Arslero now
threatened are on Monte Tormlno and
Monte Cremone.

Both wings of the crown prince's
army also have been going steadily

The guns already captured include
fifteen 28-centimeter Howitzers.
Battling Against Disadvantages.
Tho Austro-Hungarians arc battling
against many disadvantages in the
rough Alpine territory against strong

ents here declare that the artillery of
tho Austro-Hungarians has exhibited
a marked superioritv over that of the
Italians.
Aviators have contributed greatly
to the result of tho battles by a suc
cessful bombing of Italian railways
and other communications of the Ital
ians. The territory where tho fighting is
now proceeding waB voluntarily left
in the hands of the Italians at the be

because tho frontier was unfavorable

A protracted debate over the manage
ment of the Methodist book concern
wa3 expected at today's session of the
general conference, following the sub
mission of a committee report recom
mending the continuance of all the
periodicals now published under
church auspices.
The minority requested the confer
ence to adopt a plan for combining
seven of these papers into four, to
be published at New York, Chicago,
San Francisco and Portland, Ore. A
. loss of nearly ?380,000 was incurred
I during the last year, according to fig-
ures offered to the conference. Oppo
nents to a change assert this was due
largely to the system of bookkeeping.
Rev. Alexander P Camphor of Bir
mingham, Ala. ,was elected negro mis
sionary bishop for Liberia, Africa, on
the second ballot by virtually an unan
imous voto. He is president of cen
tral Alabama college at Birmingham.

the remainder of Africa. Mr. John
son has held pastorates in the north
west Iowa conference, including Sioux
Oltv. where he has been stationed
since 1909.
A resolution was adopted amid ap
plause indorsing woman suffrage.
Only six delegates voted in opposi
tion. Action of widespread importance
to Methodism was taken yesterday by
the general conference of tho Metho
dist Episcopal church, which, by an
ovens-helming majority, voted against
abolishing tho missionary episcopacy,
and later decisively indorsed plans
that may lead to the unification of
tho Methodist church In the north and
south before the next quadrennial ses
sion. Lively debate marked the proposal
to advance all missionary bishops to
the grade of bishops, whose episcopal
authority is limited -to the foreigu
mission field.

Madrid, via Paris. May 23, 3 15 a.
iu. The owners of the steamer Mar
ques dc Mudela, which left Newport,
Wales, for Bilbao, on May 1, believe
the ship has fallen a victim to a sub
marine as nothing has been heard
from her since she sailed from the
Welsh port.
According to deputies from Bilbao,
the frequent attacks against Spanish
ships by German submarines are
greatly agitating bhip owners on the
Cantabrian coast. It is reported that
these deputies have asked the gov
ernment to take action similar to that
of the "United States and demand that
Germany respect neutral flags. It is
said that the ship owners have decided
that unless suitable guarantees are ob
tained they keep their vessels in port.
