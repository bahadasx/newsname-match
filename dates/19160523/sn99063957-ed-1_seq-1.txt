CAMPAIGN T VERDUN
.
After Terrific All Night Battle French hu i Germans from
Fort Douaumont-BIoody fighting Along Entire Verdun
Front Since Saturday-Slaughter More Deadly Every
Hour As Battle Lust GrowsBloodiest Night In History
of Europe British Driven From Trenches by Bavarians
Paris, May 23. After all night fighting of great fury,
French troops expelled Germans from all except the
northeastern corner of Fort Douaumont it was officially
announced today. This is one of the greatest victories of
the Verdun campaign.
All Paiis is celebrating the triumph. It was declared
by the war office that French soldiers re-entered Fort
Douaumont after storming German positions along a
mile and a quarter front.
Further gains were also reported on the west bank of
the Meuse. The French are how convinced that the Dead
Man's hill stronghold is impregnable.
News of the French victories was partly offset by
word of British reverses near Vimy ridge. The Bavarians
there thrust back the British lines to remove the threat
against their holdings which has existed since the British
took the" offensive.
Bloody hand to hand fighting has continued along
every foot of the Verdun front since Saturday. The
slaughter along the hills northwest of Verdun is growing
deadlier every hour. Trenches have been pounded to dust.
Infantry are locked in bayonet struggles to the death.
The most intense battling is occurring at Hill 304, Dead
Man's hill, and connecting positions west of the Meuse.
Heavy German charges on both sides of. the Meuse
were repulsed, except north of Thiaumont farm, on the
east bank, where Teutons gained entrance to a trench
recently seized by French.
When today's official, communique
v.-ns issued, tho conflict was growing
more terrific every minute following
one of tlie bloodiest nights iu the. hist
ory of Europe.
Amid the ruins of Tlounmont German
detachments were still offering heroic
resistance. With bayonets, hand gren
ades, trench mines and clubbed mus
I.ets soldiers fought individually there,
Tefusing to retreat and dying where
they crouched. In the meantime the
French engineers wcro busy strength
ening their hard won gains, expecting
violent counter attacks.
One of the most spectaenlar episo
des occurred on tho west bank o'f the
Meuse where, shielded by a dense
cloud of poison gas, behind a screen of
quid fire, the Germans advanced by
a brilliant charge and entered a French
trench. Hundreds or Frenchmen wear
ing gas masks and clothing to protect
ttiem against the flames lurked in their
bomb proofs until the Germans swarm
ed in. Then they dashed out in tho
midst of the German cheers, killed
Many enemies and ejected all survivors
from-the works.
Fast of Hill 304 German bugles
naunnW a charge in forco and n wedge
ntiuped column of men ran toward the
French, intending to divido their rnuki
und outflank ono detachment holding
on important position. Word of the
attempt was immediately telephoned
to the massed batteries of "seventy
fives" in the rear and a well directed
curtain of fire dropped into tho front
rink of the Teutons, obliterating it
nd sending tho remainder of the
column, back iu confusion.
Emperor is Confident
Vienna, May 2-1. Emeperor Franz
Josef iu an interview today declared
if:

I
he was certain that the central powers
would ultimately triumph. He praised
his troops for their successful offensive
against the Italians, and also said it
was a mistake to underestimate the en
emy. "They proved exceedingly
brave," said the emperor.
1 'Tho enemy fled from Tiorg where
much booty was found," said the state
ment. "Our Graz corps crossed the
border, pursuing the defeated enemy to
tho Monte Velnn. fortifications, which
are now in our hands. We captured a
total of 188 cannon. An Austrian aero
plane bombarded railroads between
Sandona Dipinvo and Porto Gruardo."
Germans Capture Blockhouse.
Berlin, May 23. Germans captured
a blockhouso south of Camard forest,
northwest of Verdun, it was officially
announced today. The moat violent
fighting raged around the position all
night. A furious battle is raging m
tho ruins of Fort Douaumont, but the
stronghold is declared to have been re
tained by German soldiers.
British plans for a counter nttnek
south of Givoncjiy were observed by
aviators. Advances on Roclincourt
were repulsed, said the war office.
Iu the Meuse district, fighting be
came very lively owing to strong
French count ex nttneks. Assaults east
of Hill 304 and south of Dead Man's
hill wore repulsed.
Fast oT the Meuse terrific infantry
engagements wore reported. The French
were admitted to have entered some
Germnn positions, but flank move
ments were hurled back by counter at
tacks. Douaumont was- still firmly in
German hamls when the last dispatches
were received.
Victories were claimed in fighting on
Combre Heights', Meuse Heights and
southeast of Verdun. There has been
no change on the eastern and Balkan
fronts.
The German official statement, while
admitting that the French are on the
aggressive, specifically denies the
claim that practically all the wreckage
of shell shattered Fort Douaumont is
iu French hands. Berlin says the en
gagement is progressing with the ruins
held by Germans.
Italians Still Give Way.
Geneva, May 23. Despite desperate
resistance, the Austrian armieo today
ore steadily pressing forward against
Viceuza, the Italian Verdun, on the
first anniversary of Home's war
declaration. Austrian artillery is bom
barding the snow capped peak of
Monte Pasubio, 21 miles northwest of
Viccnia. This summit bars the north
ern entrance into tho valley.
The whole Tyrol front is the scene
of most desperate fighting, h-outh of
Koverto, the Italians are making a
herojc stand near Sereavalle while
their guns mounted on Monte Baldo
shell the attackers.
Southeast of Roverto, Austrinns
crooned into Italian territory at three
place. Koine reports bloody fighting
in this region or a see-saw character,
first one side and then the other reach

They Are the Women Victor
Innes of Eugene, Was As
cused of Killing
Seattle, Wash., May 23. Seattle and
Snohomish police arc endeavoring to
day to trne Mrs. Patrick Buckley and
her sister,' who lived in both cities in
1914 and 1D15 and the latter went to
Seward, Alaska, but who are now be
lieved to be Mrs. Eloise Nelms Dennis
and her sister Beatrice, Nelms, formerly
of Atlanta, Ga., for whose supposed
murder their brother-in-law, Victor B.
Innes, of Eugene, Oregon, was recently
tried and acquitted in Toxas.
The older woman was known as Mrs.
Patrick Buckley, wife of a Snohomish
suloonnian, when they lived in that
city. Chief 0f Foliee Bylling and City
Attorney M. J. McGuiuness, of Sno
homish both remember them. The lat
ter was Buckley 's attorney.
Mrs. Buckley owned somo property
in Seattle, but was not known by that
name. McGuinness says he received a
letter recently from , Dawson, Yukon
territory, from Buckley, who said ho
was going prospecting.
These Discredit Story.
Seattle, Wash., May 23 Information
tending to discredit tho theory that
Mrs. Kloise Nelms Dennis and her sis
ter, Miss Beatrice Nelms, of Atlanta,
Ga., were living in this city and in
Snohomish after they were reported
murdered two years ago at San An
tonio, Texas, was given out today by
Kdward G. Will and J. M. Nisbet, Seat
tle realty dealers.
Both men expressed themselves as
confident that Mrs. Paul Buckley, form
erly of Snohomish, who was identified
by City Attorney M. J. McGuinness, of
that city, as being Mrs. Dennis, yester
day, is not one of the missing sisters.
Nisbet and Will say they knew Mrs.
Buckley four years ago, tho former be
ing particularly well acquainted with
the Buckley family since that time.
Mrs. Buckley transacted considerable
real estate business through Nisbet and
Will and is still paying on some Seattle
property arm purchased two years ago.
The name she Bigned to the contract
was "Alice E. Buckley."
Buckley und his wife lived for more
than two years in a cottage on Nint
teonth avenuo north, here, according to
tho two realty men, later moving to
Snohomish for a short time, and then
to Alaska.
"Buckley is now deputy United
States marshal at Unaluska," said Will,
"and I am sure since seeing the pic
ture of Mrs. Dennis and her sister in n
local newspaper, that neither can pos
sibly be Mrs. Buckley."
Nisbett said: "I have known the
Buckleys well. I am sure Mrs. Buck
It y is an old time Alaskan. She was a
nurso before she married and an uncle
who died two years ago in Nebraska
left her some money. Sho has a dungh
ter named Dorothea, 7 or 8 years old. I
never heard that she had a sister."
J. I). Floury, a sawmill hand, of
Aberdeen, Wash., sent word to an at
torney for Victor E. Innes, who was
tried recently for their murder and
acquitted, that he and a man named
Joe, had ridden on the truio with two
women between Snohomish and Seattle
in August, 1914. One woman was a
Mrs. Buckley, he said, and he saw in
her hand a letter addressed to "Klois
E. Dennis."
M. J. McGuinness, city attorney of
Snohomish, furnished the information
to an attorney iit Atlanta which caused
the belief that the sisters were alive.

his protest against seizure of
