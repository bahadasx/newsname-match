Stratford, May 23. -After a sensa

son, a carpenter and buildef, and 15 of
his employes figured,- Frank Babosa, a
negro mason", who gave as his address
Stratford avenue.was apprehended this

COUNTY HEALTH
OFFICER TO ACT
IN LOCAL CASES
Health Commissioners Place
Burden of Sanitation
Here Upon Him.
HILL HAS COURT
ENJOIN LANDLORD
Owner Must Clean Up Un
der Penalty of Being In
j Contempt of Court.
Through an injunction issued - this
week by. Judge. Scott sitting in the
common pleas court the Bridgeport
board, of health has transferred the
burden of sanitation In the city from
Its shoulders directly upon those of
recalcitrant landlords. J ''
The injunction . in -.question, '. in - ef
fect compelling ' the :, owner, ,. of the
three family1 tenement at 588-1-2 La
fayette street : to . install additional
toilet conveniences within a limited
number of days or close the .. house
under 'penalty of contempt . of court,
comes as the climax of many months
fight upon the part oof the local
board and - will . be used as a. new,
quick and positive method of prevent
ing violations of the health ordi
nances. ,
Though the practice has long been
pursued by County Health Officer
Georgo E, Hill, in outlying districts,
it has ' no precedent as far as health
records show in this city.
Heretofore the practise has been
for an inspector to notify the land
lord of needed sanitation. If the or
der was not complied with, delay in
taking it before the health ' board
members was often . occasioned. A
further lapse resulted in notifications
of prosecution being sent from the
office 'of the : city prosecutor. In
some instances the violator has es
caped in minor courts, with small fine.
The present method is to place the
facts In possession of the county
health officer, who in turn lays them
before the higher court asking for an
injunction restraining the use of the
dwelling after a limited ' number of
days unless conditions are complied
with. To maintain the dwelling open
is to become in. contempt of . court.
Should the house owner believe the
board of health unjust in demands, re
course is had in argument to prevent
the . Injunction becoming permanent.
Health authorities in this city to
day assert that the new practice will
quickly clean up many infractions of
the law heretofore hard to combat.
It is further asserted that with
every house in the city occupied at
good rentals the landlords cannot
plead hardship when asked to install
needed sanitary eqeuipment, as has
heretofore been , pleaded before the
board.

While confusion reigned in the car.
which had few passengers, at - that
early hour, the broken crank-shaft is

Just her rubber and glancing around
again she saw Babosa hastening- to

to place his hands on Miss Bennetto
she declares, when she screamed.
Her cries attracted the attention of
Mr. Persson and his workmen, who
were building a house about 500 feet
away. Babosa ran: Dropping their
tools, the workman chased the fugi

him hear the . bridge. Miss Bennetto
fainted in the arms of Mr. Persson
and it was several minutes before she
revived. A telephone call was sent to
Constable Barnum, and he took the
prisoner to the town court' for trial.
On the stand he denied that he at
tempted to molest Miss Bennetto and
said that he was on his way to meet
his wife, who works in - a shop in
Bridgeport. "When I saw she was not
my wife I immediately stopped and
started back for home," he said. He

That seven children, above the age
of 4, have been boarded, in the Falr
&eSd institution, wh.le children under
fowr "years . of, age ' who as public
charges, had a claim upon the shelter
of the Fairfield home, have been forc
ed into Lakeview home for want of
room at Fairfield, was revealed at the
meeting yesterday afternoon. ,
Tie Fairfield house was provided by
the city as a place for children un
der four who become public charges.
Unil this place was obtained, such
little ones were made inmates of Lake
view home. The surroundings there
were not rewarded as conducive to
the well Toeing of th etots. The Fair
field home;- while limited in its accom
modations, has. been found ample, m-
tll recently, to Vrovid-e for aJK such
children.
Investigation Into reports of the re-t
cent overcrowding of the Fairneld in
stitution brought, to light the presence
of several children well past four-years
of age, not properly wards of the city
who were classed upon the charities
recoras as voaracrs in lixw uuuio.
Further inquiry revealed the presence
in Lakeview home of children under
four years, for. whom provision could
not be made In, Fairfield because the
nlace was filled. ' '
Besides the forcing of children un
der four into Lakeview hofne by the

mi-tin ent to the county homes usually
a matter, of a day or, two and these
children, too, instead of -being placed
in Fairfield, as was planned when the
home was established, have been hous
ed in the almshouse, V
This was the subject of vigorous
discussion at the meeting of the 'board
of charities late yesterday. Mrs. M.
H. Ford, of the committee on chil
dren, of the board of charities, ques
tioned Superintendent Gordon at
length on the conditions at Fairfield.
As a result of the Inquiry the 'board
decided upon the elimination of the
practice of boarding children in , the
Fairfield home,, and the superinten
dent was directed to give notice to
persons or organizations now board
ing children there to make other ar
rangements within three days.

Answers on Glover's Politi
cal Affiliations Give .
Crowd a Laugh.
Washington, May 2 3 Former , Pres
ident Roosevelt appeared on the wit
ness stand today in the perjury trial
of three officers of the Riggs National
Bank. He testified as a character
witness for President C. C. G-lover, of
the bank, one of the) indicted men.
Colonel Roosevelt said he had
known Mr. Glover since 1889, that tie
had had business and social relations
with the ; banker while civil service
commissioner, assistant secretary ' of
the navy, vice-president and Presi
dent. . Mr. Qloverfs general , character
and standing In the District of ..Co
lumbia, he added, were of the highest.
Colonel Roosevelt said he had come to
Washington voluntarily to testify in
the case. ,
Colonel Roosevelt reached the court
room ten minutes 'before the ,court
convened. A orowd was waiting to
see hini and cheered loudly as he en
tered. Several times during, his tes
timony the former President's answers
aroused amusement, particularly when
he said that he never had any political
dealings with Mr. Glover and that be
knew the 'banker had kwpported either
Mr. Taft or Mr. Wilaon in 1912.
Colonel Roosevei" said that while
he first knew Mr. Glover in 1889, in
timacy between them, started five .or
six years later. . ' . - ' .
Mr. Glover was often a guest- at the
White House, . he " added, and the
Roosevelt children were often guests
a. the banker's summer home. .
"I knew him very well socially,"
continued the colonel, "especially -h
connection with philanthropic work he
did in thevDistrict. I didn't have much
political talk with him. I knew in
1912 he did not support me. I knew
he was for Mr. Wilson or Mr. Taft and
knew he was against me. . Our ac
quaintance was not political but of a
social and business character.'.
The VColonel started to tell how he
kept his account in the bank because
or nts laitn in iiioverr Dut -i-nsirici. At
torney Laskey objected that his an
swer was beyond that allowed , a char
acter witness. Col. Roosevelt solved
the difficulty himself by getting in
and about the" same answer in another
way.
"My general 'knowledge of Mr. Glo
ver ,by universal report," he said.
'was that his business integrity" was
such that, naturally, I and my chil
dren kept their accounts in his .bank."
Mr. Laskey moyed to. strike out this
as a voluntary statement but justice
Siddons allowed it to remain.
What can you say for your ac
quaintance with Mr. Glover and what
you have heard of him as to his rep
utation for probity and integrity?"
counsel asked. x
I should say that - no man in the
district stood higher in probity and in
tegrity for the handing of public , and
private business from the standpoint
of public morality."
Mr. Roosevelt concluded by saying
that while he was not well acquainted
with the two s other defendants. Wil
liam J. Flather and Henry H. Flather,
vice president and former cashier of
the bank, their reputation when he
was in Washington was good.
At the conclusion of his testimony
Colonel Roosevelt left the city imme

"PREPAREDNESS
PARADE" TO BE
EMULATED EIERE
Mayor Orders Demonstra
tion in Favor of Better
Protection For U. S.
Mayor Wilson today named a com
mittee to arrange for a "Preparedness
Parade, "similar to that recently hei
in New York. The m;yor fef Is that
all citizens are . in 7 sympathy with
such a movement' and that all will
join in making it a success either by
taking part in the parade themselves,
inducing others to do so or by decor
ating their homes or places of busi
ness.i .
The parade will , probably be held
on the afternoon of Saturday, June 3.
The National Preparedness League in
a recent letter to the mayor asked
him to set this date and make ar
rangements for the. parade. The idea
being to signify that the citizens be
lieve the country should be better
prepared than it is to repel invasion,
and to uphold national honorthan it
is at present.
The mayor feels that at least 10,000
persons, will readily take part in such,
a parade. , Like the parade in New
York it is intended to include the var
ious military and ' semi-military or
ganizations, patriotic societies, work
ers from all lines of industry, school
boys, boy soouts and boys' brigade
members. Women as well as men will
take part in the parade and the mayor
has appointed- two women -on the

- The mayor's letter and the
list of
the committee follows:
."Other cities throughout the United
States are arranging 'Preparedness Pa
rades' an It seems fitting that Bridge
port should do the same. I think that
June 3 should' be designated as the
date for such event as this is the day
which has been chosen by most of the
other cities. I realize that the time
is short but I believe that full arrange
ments can be made within the time
limit if action is put Into the same. I
believe that the citizens of Bridgeport
will participate in large numbers.
"I have therefore appointed the fol
lowing committee to ake full charge
and make complete arrangements,
namely: Major Frederick J. Adams,
G. A. R. ; F. L.. Chapman, commander!
William N. Barnum, Post commander.
S. of v.; Cassius E. Deltz. commander

"It is necessary that the committee
meet at once and meetings may be
held at the mayor's office, city hall, at
any time convenient to the committee.
"Hoping that each of the appoin
tees may find it convenient to serve on
this committee, and thanking each and
