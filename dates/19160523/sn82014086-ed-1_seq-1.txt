Great Offensive of Austrians in Southern Tyrol
Continues
OVER 24,000 ITALIANS
Austrians Have Been Heavily Reinforced and at Several
Points Seem to be Throwing Back the Italians Toward
Their Own Country In
the French and Germans Claim Successes for Their Arms
at Various Points British
Mesopotamia . Are Drawing Nearer Kut-el-Amara,
Where a Large Number of Their Officers and Men Are.
Held Captive.
Hard lighting is still In progress
between the Austrians and the Ital
ians In the Tyrol; the French and the
Germans In the region of "Verdun and
the Germans and 'British around La
bassee. The great offensive of the Austrians
. against the Italians In southern Tyrol
continues unabated, and at several
points the Austrians seem to be grad
ually throwing back the Italians to
ward their own territory. Southeast
of Trent, on the Lavarone plateau,
Vienna says the Italians have been
dislodged from all their positions and
adds that the Austrians have cap
tured Fima, Madriolo ond the height
Immediately west of the frontier from
the summit as far as the Astach (As
, tioo) valley.
The Austrians for their offensive,
according to Rome advices, have been
heavily reinforced in men and guns.
Since the beginning of the offensive,
Vienna asserts, over 24,000 men have
been made prisoners and 172 cannon
have been captured by the Austrians.
In the region of Verdun tooth the
French and Germans claim successes
for their arms at various points. An
interesting point in the latest French
official communication is the state
ment that the French have penetrated
Fort Doiiaumont, northeast of Ver
dun, which the Germans stormed and
captured Feb. 25, four days after the
commencement of the -assault -on-. Vei
dun. and from which all attempts to
drive them out proved futile. -The
Germans, however, still hold the
northern part of Fort Douaumont. A
PREJUDICE OF FARMERS
AGAINST FEMALE LABOR
Disapproved by British Financial. Secretary-
of Treasury,
London, May 22, 51158 p. m. Francis
Vandyke Acland, financial secretary of
the treasury, speaking in tlie house
of commons on the agricultural situa
tion today, made a somewhat disturb
ing statement. It was imperative,
Mr. Acland said, that farmers-should
drop their prejudice against the em
ployment of female labor. A break
down in home supplies was avoidable
only If the labor situation did not
grow worse. The danger point of
greatly decreased production already
had been reached, and even as things
were going it was now feared that
England could not hope to maintain
her production on last year's level. If
more men were swept into the army
from the farms she could escape fam
ine only by diverting to - importation
of foodstuffs in ships which are so
urgently needed for the transport of
munitions. - -
"And," Mr. Acland concluded, "we
are unable to say whether there, will
be ships to divert that way." , ,

DAUGHTER PA'NKHURST iV
IS NOW IN MELBOURNE
Has Figured in a "No Conscription'
I ', Disturbance There,
Melbourne, Australia, 'May 22. Adele
Pankhurst,, daughter of the English
Buffragette leader, has figured in an
other "no conscription" disturbance in
Melbourne during which she and other
anti-conscription women speakers
were struck in the face by stones
thrown by jspldiers and others. -.-
Thp anti-rvmRnTHrktinnistst helrl tbeir
demonstration on the banks of thejlsbell and others. Is said to be entitled I
xarra river on a Sunday arternoon, i
under the auspices of the socialist so
ciety, and the meeting attracted a
crowd of about 3,000 persons, includ
ing some 1'50 soldiers. The latter set
up a counter-demonstration after the
meeting had adopted a resolution de
nouncing' "the crafty attempt of Inter
ested individuals to foist conscription
upon Australia, knowing it to be for
the purpose of smashing down the
working class organization and for the
cheapening of. labor."
The soldiers mounted an improvised
platform, about ten yards from where
Miss Pankhurst was speaking, and a
corporal of the Australian Expedition
ary Forces pleaded in strong language
to the crowd to cease listening "to
such rot as that woman over there is
speaking." The corporal's speech was
greeted with cheers by his comrades.
and a resolution in favor of conscrip
tion at the earliest possible moment
was passed by the soldiers and their
sympathizers.
Later, when one of. the socialist ora
tors declared that "every man who
went to fight- was a murderer," there
was a general rush for the anti-con
scription platform, which, with a
speaker on it, , was overturned and
there was a general riot during which
stones were thrown and the anti-con -
scriptionists were - driven ; from the
place. . -. .

Promised $15,000 When He Got Possession of lib
Father-in-Law's Estate.
New York, May 22. Dr. Arthur "War
ren Waite, the young dentist and ten
nis player, who was placed on trial
today before Justice Clarence J. Shearn
and a jury In the criminal branch of
the supreme court, charged with the
murder of his wealthy father-in-law,
John E. Peck, of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
not only administered deadly disease
germs and poison to his -victim, but
applied chloroform to (lis nostrils until
he died, it was alleged by District At
torney Jixlward Swann In his opening
address for the state. -
. Jury Quickly Selected.
The trial, which began shortly after
10 o'clock this morning, moved rapidly.
A jury was selected in less than three
hours and the district attorney con
sumed only half an hour in his formal
presentation of the state's case. Mean
time, Waite appeared as much un
moved as the most disinterested spec
tator in the court room.
Resume of Circumstances.
. Aside from the address of the dis
trict attorney, in which . he recited
Waite'a life history and gave a com
plete resume of the circumstances lead
ing up to the crime, to" which Waite
already has confessed, the outstanding
feature of the trial today was the tes
timony of . Dr. Albert Adair Moore.
Waite. the witness declared, admitted
to him he had purchased arsenic for
his 72 year old father-in-law "because
the old gentleman did not want to
live." Previously, Viten suspicion first
waa directed to Waite. Dr. Jloore said.
the accused dentist had telephoned to
him and asked him if he (Dr. Moore)
thought "they could hold him (Waite)
for the death of Mr. Peck because a
nurse had not been engaged to attend
the aged victim." '
"Waite asked me," said Dr. Moore,
if arsenic administered before death
would show in an autopsy, as distin
guished from the same poison when
used in embalming fluid.
Hie witness said he replied that the
poison would 1e discernible in the
brain if administered before death.
To Rely Upon Insanity Plea.
Waite's counsel Intimated that they
would rely upon a plea of insanity to
save their client from the electric oh air.
To combat testimony that probably will
be given tomorrow by alienists both
from this city and Grand Rapids in
support of the prosecution's contention
that Waite was sane ' and hla crime
actuated by A desire for money, the
defense announced tonight that one or
more alienists would be called by them.
Waite's Wife Not Present.
Neither Mrs. Clara Louise Peck
Waite. wife of the prisoner, nor Mrs.
Margaret Horton, his companion In a
"studio" tiere, was present at the trial
today. Both, however, will testify
against waite. the district attorney
announced. Mrs. Waixe probably will
go jpn tne atana vv eanesday morning
er brother, i'ercy fecK, will precede
her, v -
Dr. Moore said he was first called to
visit Peck on March 5. seven days be
lore peck's death. - A condition seem
ingly no more serious than might be
expected of a simple case of nausea
slightly developed into one which gave
cause for alarm. Dr. Moore in a con
versation with Waite said he asked the
young dentlst'What he thoutit about
sending Mr. Peck to a hospital. Waite
replied, he asserted, that toe (Waite)
didn't think It wise, as "Clara (mean
ing Mrs. Waite) protoably wouldn't like
it." -
Later, according to Dr. Moore, Wait
inquired of the physician if he did not
think It would De well to - prepare
Mrs. Waite for any sudden change fot
the worse in her father's condition.
"I told him," said Dr. Moore, "that
I did not t;hlnk Mr. Peck's condition
was aa serious aa all that, and added
lliat ho (Waite) should not appear so
pessimistic"
Telephone Conversation.
The morning of Mr. Peck's death
Waite telephoned to him. Dr. Moore
said. - .
"I thought he must be mistaken when
he told me he had Just come from his
father-in-law's room and the latter
seemed to be dead," continued Dr.
Moore. "So I directod him to go back
and reel Mr. Feck a pulse a second time,
"I held the wire meantime and
Waite reported to mo presently that he
was afraid Mr. Peck was dead."
Although he made an examination of
the body. Dr. Moore said there- appar
ently was nothing to indicate Mr. Peck
died by other than natural causes.
'!Dld Waite say anything with refer.
ence to his father-in-law's death?" he
was asked.
"Yes, I think he said Too bad, poor
oia manr
Anxious to Get In Touch With Under
taker.
' Dr. Moors said Waite appeared anx
lous to get in touch with an under
taker, eaying he desired to take the
body to Grand Rapids the following
arternoon ana there nave it cremated.
'"Just six weeSts ago,", he q-uoted
wane, we naa to take my mother-in
law to lirana itapias on that same
train." .
Dr. Moore asserted he obtained th
information with which he filled out
the death certificate from Mrs. .Peck.
Asked if he had any experience
arsenic poisoning cases. Dr. Moore said
he had not. .

Alienists to Combat Te:
Prosecution ; :
r-
ids, Dr. Moore said the dentist tela
phoned to him. He said Waite asked:
"Do you suppose, doctor, ;l:ey could
hold me for 'Mr. Peck s death because 1
failed to have a nurse for the old gen
tleman?" On March 22 Waite met him by ap
pointment. Dr. Moore said. "He saii
to me," asserted Dr. Moore, "that he
supposed I had seen by the news
papers that he was suspected of th
murder. - I told him I had and added
that it looked very ugly.
He wanted to know if I could offer 1
any suggestion to him. I said he ought !
to demand an autopsy. 'Well,' he re
plied, 'I would, but I don't Hiink Clara
would allow it.'"
Waite wanted to know. Dr. Moora
added, whether an autopsy would de
termine wnether arsenic had teen ad
ministered before death or in embalm
ing fluid after death. Dr. Moore said
he replied there was a very marked
difference, in the effect, whereupon f
vvtuLis liiLurxneu aim an autopsy already
naa Deen held, and that ' enough arse
nic had been found in Mr. Peck's ixwly
to kill two men."- .
