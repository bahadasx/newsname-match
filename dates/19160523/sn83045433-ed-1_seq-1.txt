(By the Sun News Service.)
Oyster Bay, N. Y., May 2'=-Colonel
Roosevelt told a delegation from the
Roosevelt Republican committee today
that any man who doesn't declare him
self for principles of Americanism is
against them. and that every patriotic
man sho'-:d treat puibl:c servants on this
basis.
There was no doubt that the Colonel
had Justice Hughes on his mind, and the
twenty-four members of the committee
who were present nodded their heads in
acceptance of that conception and ap
plauded. They also set up a handelap
ping when Colonel Roosevelt said it was
useless for any public man to announce
himself in vague, general terms as in
favor of Americanism and preparedness.
whether he be in or out of office.
Colonel Roosevelt read these words
from a speech he had prepared for the
occasion. He read them to the members
of the committee who had motored -out
here to the Colonel's house and had
formed an earnest semi-circle in the big
- trophy room, where they were joined by
live of Oyster Bay's prominent citizens.
As soon as the Colonel, clad In his khaki
riding suit, appeared on the steps lead
ing down from the hall to the trophy
room, George Von L. Meyer. former Sec
retary of the Navy and chairman of the
Rocsevelt Republican committee, deliv
ered an address.
A Orisi* in History.
Wh'ben Mr. Meyer had concluded, the
Colonel said:
"Your devotion is to the cause, and to
the man Insofar as he for the time being
embodies the caus2e. This is precIsely the
attitude I took in my Trinidad statement
I now hold, and shall continue to hold.
this a great time of crisis in our country's
history, because it Is a great crisis in the
hisory of the world. If we are unpre
pared. if ne a7 split and sundered by
rivalries of crecd. of sections and of na
tional ori;in. ;f our country's action is to
be cond:ltonl bv help:essness without,
and the phyhenate within, the career of
the 'nit' l Stues as a great factor in the
worlr's iv:l:zation Is at an end.
' Theve is to use of being for half meae
ie .f Arc-carisn and preparedness,
still less is of any use for any public man
to announce himself in vague general
'erms as In favor of Americanism and
;reparedness. unless his whole course of
ar-ton i: public life has made it evident,
and now makes it evidence, that he
means Jast exact:y what he says.
Fighting for Principles.
"Unless, if he is in office. or has been In
once, his career has been such as in full
est measure to warrant the belief that
he Is a man of deeds and not of words in
this matter, and in any crisis, whether
he be In or out of office, he frankly and
fully takes a position on the concrete
facts which are up for decision and ap
tiles the abstract statement directly to
these concrete facts.
"I an fighting for principles. They are
the principles you are organizing to sup
port, and with all my heart r welcome
such support, accepting it as given pri
marly to the principles, and only secon
darily for myself.
"Any man at this time of crisis who is
not aggressively, openly and specifically
for these principles, is against them, and
every patriotic man should treat our Pub
Ile servants on this basis."

Atlantic City, N. J.. Wiay 2.-A gift of
$750,000 to the relief and the sustentation
funds of the Presbyterian Church was
announced at today's session of the Pres

by the late Mrs. D. Willis James, of New
York, who contributed $250000 before her
death.
Rev. John Fox, of the New York Pres

a tract on heresy. In his introduction he
said:
"The U-boats of unbelief have fired an
other torpedo at the Bible, blown the
very bottom out of the book of Exodus,

bore down hard.
Dr. Moore, who an house physician of
the Park Avenue Hotel, had met Mr.
Peck in 1915, told of his visits to the
man at One Hundred and Sixteenth
street from March 5 on.
Dr. Moore then told the Story of the
night of the tragedy. He was called up
at 12:55 on the morning of March 12
by Waite, much excited. 'Something
has happened to Mr. Peck," came the
word over the phone, "I am afraid he
is dead. T heard him moaning in the
bathroom and helped him into his bed
room. Just as he was sitting on the
edge of the bed he fell over and I am
afraid he is dead."
As the physician told this many eyes
were turned toward the defendant and it
was at that time he was nodding, his eyes
closed. as if he were enjoying a nap.
He opened his eyes a moment later, but
did not look at the witness.
Dr. Moore told of his arrival at the
flat, and the fact that he found Mr.
Peck dead.
"Poor old man. Poor old man. Too
bad, too bad." were the words attributed
to Waite, who, clad in his night clothes
and bath robe, attended the physician
