WOMEN TELL OF
COP'S CONDUCT
A crowd with a big ear
stretched for promised spicy tes
timony swarmed the council
chambers last night at the public
hearing of former Patrolman J. W.
Cochran, discharged by Commis
sioner Pettit for alleged miscon
duct while in uniform and Im
proper advances toward women
on his beat.
Although Frank Cole, chairman
of the civil service board, "pep
ped" the meeting along as fast as
he could, only about half of the
evidence had been given at. 10:45
o'clock, and the hearing was con
tinue until 7:30 o'clock to
night.
The prosecution, conducted by-
City Attorney Harmon and bis
assistant, Frank Carnnhan, used
Mrs. Mabel Thompson and Mrs.
Alice Stanley as its chief wit
nesses.
Women Muke <'hat-gee.
Both women claimed that on
no less than seven occasions Offi
cer Coclirnn had made advances
to them or had "helped them
drink a sociable drink from a
little can of beer."
Mrs. Thompson, who, it is
claimed, was forced to move
from ID.II Jefferson avenue to
409 South 21st street, through
complaints registered by Cochran,
said that he had visited her home
several times after her husband
had gone to work.
"What did he do on these occa
sions?" City Attorney Harmon

A number of new witnesses
were called In the rebuttal of

.Judge Fred 0. Brown or Seattle,
representing the I 6-\ ear-old girl
wife.
The following, including neigh

"Is that the only time he ever
visited you?"
"No. One time ho came at 8
In the morning. He rspped on
the door und asked to come In.
I opened the dor in my night dress
and asked him what he wanted.
One time I gave him two bits to
buy himself a cigar."
Mrs. Stanley's was similar.
Frank Kelley, attorney for
Cochran, attacked the character
of the city's witnesses. He at
tempted to show by witnesses that
the Thompson home had been fre
quented by white women and col
ored men, and that it bore the
general reputation of being a
"tough joint."
Mrs. Chrystal Dualley, said by
Harmon to be the most dangerous
witness against Cochran, got
"cold feet" after signing an affi
davit and failed to show up at the
hearing last night.
Refuses to Appear.
It was learned later that she
had appeared before Attorney-
Jones and said she didn't want to
appear, asking hi in what they
would do to her if she went to
Seattle. An attempt will be made
to get her to appear tonight.
The hearing throughout was
brightened by humorous decisions
on points of law by "Judge" Cole.
Cole conducted the case as he
ssw fit, admitting that he prob
ably was making grievous errors
throughout.
From time to time he made
comments from the bench.
The trial committee is com
posed of Cole, W. E. Daniels, Dr.
. '. P. Goff, Lind Messlnger and
A. E. West.
A number of character wit
nesses testified in behalf of Coch
ran, claiming they had never
heard of him taking a drink. .
