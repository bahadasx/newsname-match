Law's Oeath^Rapid Progreaa Being
Made in Presentation of State's Case
—Defendant Pale and Nervout—
Wife Not Preaant.
1
New York, May 23.—The state con
tinued to pile up medical testimony as
the foundation of Its case against Dr.
Arthur Warren Waite, charged with
the murder of bis father-in-law, John
E. Peck.
N
Dr. Albertus A. Moore, the physician
who attended Mr. Peck befd*^ his
death, testified that Dr. Waite admit-_
ted he'had purchased arsenic for his
aged father-in-law. The reason he
gave, according to the witness, waa
''that the old gentleman did not want
to live."
District Attorney Swan, In his open
ing address, claimed that Waite -has
tened his vlctlmfe last moments by ap
plying to Jyls nostrils a handkerchief
soaked with chloroform.
Dr. Victor C. Vaughn, dean of the
medical department of the University
of Michigan, at Ann Arbor, who made
an analysis of .the organs of Mr. Peck,
was the first witness today.
Waite Is Nervoua.
He described In detail the effects of
the arsenic. Waite sat with bowed
head. His paleness betrayed Ids ner
vous tension when glass jars contain
ing the organs of John E. Peck's body
were produced.
Dr. Vaughn swore he found two and
a. half grains of arsenic in Mr. Peck's
Stomach and amounts of it too small to
weigh in other organs.
BF. Stanley R. Benedict, professor of
chemistry at the Cornell medical school,
who was next called, corroborated tbe
testimony of Dr.' Vaughn.
Evidenoe of Chloroform.
.Dr. Bgnedict added that In examining
a part or the brain of .the dead man it*
-foiipd«n unmisU4)mbie1to?ce: of tehloro
form. Later he examined the embalm
ing fluid used but found no trace of
chloroform.
MrB. Waite, wife of the accused, was
not In 'the court room at the opening,
but was expected to be called soon to
testify against her husband.
Mrs. Dorothy Van Palmenberg,
friend of Mrs. Margaret fcVrton, with
whom Waite shared a studio, arrived
early. She was expected to testify for
the state. •»..
Long in Fear of Arrestt,
Testimony of Dr. Albertus Adkir
Moore, the physician who attended
John E. Peck, indicated that Dr. Waite
feared some time before his arrest that
he might- be accused of causing the
death of his father-in-law.
Dr. Moore said thij.t when Dr
Waite returned to New York from
Grand 'Rapids after Mr. Peck's fu
neral the dentist telephoned to him. He
said Dr. Waite asked:
"io you suppose, doctor, they could
hold^me for Mr. Peck's death because
I /failed to have a nurse for tho old
gentleman?"
-Waite, the witness also declared, ad
mitted to, him .he had purchased ar
senic Jfor his ^72-year-old father-in-law
"because the old gentleman didn't
want to live."
Told Waite "It Looked .Ugly."
On March 22 Waite met him by ap-*
pointmept, Dr. Moore said.
-"He said to me," asserted Dr.
Moore, that he supposed-1 had seen
by the newspapers that he was sus
pected of the murder. I told him I
had, and added that It looked ugly.
"He wanted to know If I could offer
any suggestion to him. I said he
ought to demand, an autopsy.
"Weil,' he replied, 'I would, but I
don't thing Clara (Mrs. Waite) would
allow It.'"
