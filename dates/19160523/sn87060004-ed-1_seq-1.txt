MRS. KINCHELOE Iff '
WASHINGTON SOCIETY
A Washington paper says :
Mrs. D. H. Ksncheloe, the
handsome young wife of the new
congressman, was the star at
very smart tea at the Congress
ional Club, at which she gave a
musical and elocutionary recital
entirely unassisted. The versa
tility of Mrs. Kincheloe's talents
was brilliantly evidenced in. a.
program of remarkable variety
including, piano, vocal and wbiBj
thng solos and dialect and dra
matic readings. Her whistling
improvisations to her own varied
and original accomplishment!!
have given the capable young;
Eentuckian especial prestige on.
Chautauqua circuits.
LIQUID FIRE- . .
PAST AND. PRESENT
J
The use by thd Germans of. fire-
throwing machines in the assault on
Verdun has been hailed as something:
new in military operation. As a.
matter of fact, liquid fire is a product
of the warfare of the Middle Ages.
In the strenuous days when our
doughty an-estors were besieged la
castles, they used to arnuse them
selves by standing on the ramparts
and pouring boiling oil and burning;
pitch below. This usually proved
disconcerting tor the attacking, party.
The Germans have gone several
steps farther. All the accessories that
the knights of old brought into play
in the gentle, art of fire-hurling were,
a bucket, its contents, and a good
strong pair of arms. The modern
Teutonic firey fluid can be distributed
much more deftly and with greater
force by reason of a simple little, de
vice, known as a ''fire projector.
Petrol is poured into a . tank under
pressure of several hundred pounds
per square inch. The tank is equip
ped with a long nozzle, and the pet-
rol Is enflamed as it leaves the nozzle
by an electric spark. Thus the Ger
man soldier is able to sit safely be
hind his own lines and spray the en
emy with fire over a distance of more
than a hundred feet much in the
manner of a suburbanite watering;
his lown with an oversized garden
hose.
