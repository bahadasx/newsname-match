War Department Notifies Colonel

WASHINGTON, May ' S3.- With
the economic tuat.on in Mi-
co rapidly Bearing; a crisis, the
political and military situation there
haa received a poah in the wrong di
rection by brusque demands made by
Carranza commanders upon American
officers to retreat northward at once
and to surrender horses, fodder and
aappliea captured from the Villista
Via nrl Vtir f n ixa Un.. '
These demand .were vVfused flatly,
according to the, repotts reaching the

uj gciam rroini neaaquarters re
ceived in this city' last "light report
ing on the situation in Mexico, say that
the American cavalry commands, which
have been scouting south of Paral,
have ben withdrawn to the base camp,
and have made their mrt. Major
Howne, in command of these forces,
says in his official account Aif his march
that his noon encountered General Cav
axos, a Carrancista commander. The
feeling between the wen of the two
commands was tense from the start,
nd was not eased any by the brus
que manner in which the Mexican de
manded the Immediate surrender of the
boody captured by the Americans from
the marauding Villa bands. This booty
consisted of a number of horses, large
quantities of corn and other supplies.
Refuse To Withdraw
The demand was instantly refused
by Major Howie, and was then fol
lowed by the demand that the Ameri
can horsemen beirioisv. immediate
treat northward. Tbi. Major Howze
answered by saying that he was not
ready to start North, having received
no instructions from his own onmman.l.
ing officer, and that until he did so, he
proposed to remain where he was.
This apparently took some of the
wind out of the sails of the Mexican
general, who then made a request that
he be allowed to march past the Ameri
can position, in order to consolidate
his own command. This request was
immediately granted by Major Howse.
In dewribing the character of the
Mexican troops, seen as they filed past
bis own camp, Major Howie says that
they are half boys, some apparently
not more than fourteen years old, rag
ged and dirty in the extreme, but well
armed.
Economic Crisis Impends
Despatches from the City of Mexico,
aeaung witn the economic and finan
cial status of the revolution-torn coun
try, are gloomy in the extremo. The
outlook is declared to be graver than
for years, the continued drain upon lie
country by a succession of revolutions
having exhausted it, and broucht it to
the verge of financial ruin. The mone
tary problem is reported to be acute,
with millions upon millions of worth
- less paper afloat and nothing in tlio
treasury to redeem the government 's
currency, which is dropping in value to
an almost negligible point.
The food shortage in the capitul :s
also reported serious. The city In more
or less dependent upon transportation
for the bulk of its food supplies, imd
the railroads of the country have suf
fered terribly in the wars. To add to
the difficulty of the situation almost
all tho railroads of the country are
now tied up by strikes, so that no
trains are moving anywhere.
Government Gather Information
Consul-General Letcher is expected to
reach here today with a report to the
state department, and bearing reports
from five other consuls, detailing at
length the conditions in their respec
tive district.

(AuocUtad Press ST Tsdsral Wireless.)
BERLIN, May 23. At several
points on the Italian front the Aus
triana are continuing their successful
drive, hammering the enemy with big
guns which have been brought in large
numbers to assist in the forcing back
of the Latin troops.
boutheast of Trent, on the Laverone
plateau and just across the Austrian
border from Italy, the fighting has
been particularly desperate and suc
cessful. Here, Vienna reports, the Ital
ians have been cleared oft completely,
their positions having been, captured,
and thousands of prisoners, together
with numbers of machine gun and
heavr cannon.
Italian Cannot Stem War
The Austrian have also captured
Fima Mandriolo height, west of the
Italian frontier and opposite the Astico
valley. Here, too, the truggle was
stubborn, the Italians resisting strong
ly but being at last compelled to retire,
after havlno- lost heavllv th. -

WASHINGTON, May 23. Bear
Adml. William B. Caperton, command
ing the naval forces at Santo Domingo,
reported to the navy department last
night that he is preparing for the dis
tribution of the American sailors and
marines, now policing that city, in an
effort to secure complete quiet.
It is expected that Admiral Caperton
will begin the establishment of a polic
ing system similar to that now in force
in Hayti, and congress probably will be
asked to authorize naval and marine
officers to serve under the Dominican
government as officers of the constabu
lary. Officials of the state department
said last night that the department ha
no intention of recognizing the election
of Carvajails, as the successor to Pre
sident Jiminec, believing as it does
that the impeachment of Jiminei was
an illegal political coup, engineered by
the minority and revolutionary leaders
in the chamber of deputies.

Food Shortage
In Great Britain
Now Alarming
Farmers Warned That They Must
Abandon Prejudices and Em
ploy Woman Labor
( Associates! rrsss by rdrtl Wlrslsss.)
LONDON, May 23. A food shortage
of alarming proportions will confront
the United Kingdom unless the farmer
abandon their prejudices against the
employment of woman labor, and bend
all their energies to the increase of
crop production.
This statement, made bv - Fraaci
Dyke A eland, financial secretary of the
treasury, is the house of commons yes
terday, succeeded in throughly alarm
ing the members. Unless some such
steps a he proposes, are adopted, said
Mr. Acland, it will be necessary to feed
the country by diverting ships which
are urgently needed for tho transport
ing of munitions of war. and, he added,
he la "not t all sure that the country
will have the ships to divert."
Danger Point Beached
"The danger point in the enormously
decreased production in this country
has been reached." said the financial
secretary, la ' outlining the condition
of the country to the house. "We'ta'et
longer ean afford to cater to our pre
judices, but must bend every effort to
meeting these conditions and increas
ing the crop of foodstuffs, upon which
the country must depend, ia part at
least, for the food it eats.
"If more and still more mea are to
be swept into the army from the farms,
the United Kingdom ean escape from
famine ,in one way alone. We will be
forced to divert ships, now so urgently
needed for the. transport of munitions
of war tei the;-troops abroad and at
home, to the carrying of provisions we
should be raising; in the kingdom."
Mr. Acland the took up the ques
tion of, the .shortage of ships, caused
in part by the Germsun submarine cam
paign and. in part by the necessity for
transport ' for ' mea and munition of
war. 4 v.

not ho diverted from this m for ny
purpose. Indeed, I am not at aH sure
that even if the need for food at heme
wre great we would have Ship, to div
ert." In speaking of the submarine cam
paign and the loss to British skipping
caused by mines, Mr. Acland told tho
house that since the outbreak of the
War 570 fishing vessels, of all sizes and
types, have been destroyed, and 500

Crocker Land Proved Myth But
American Expedition Secures
Valuable Information
(Aitoclaud Prass by rsdsral Wireless.)
LONDON, May 22. Prof. Maurice
Taniiary of Chicago, member of the
American 'rocker Land Expedition,
has arrived at Copenhagen and report 1
that the expedition achieved good
scientihV '"suits. Ice is holding othel
members of the exvdition with th
ship in North Star Buy.
The Crocker Land expedition went
North in DM 3 to locate the supposed
Arctic continent jvhlch Admiral Pe
ary reported having seen and which
he named "Crocker Land." Ice spoil
ed the party's plans to return last
year and the party has had to stay
in the Arctic all this winter and may
possibly not get out for many months.
Donald MacMillan, leader of the ex
pedition, wrote back laat year that
his party saw- the same vast expanse
of valleys and peaks that Peary had
reported but that closer observation
proved it an Arctic mirage. Their
findings have been generally accepted
as proving that "Crocker Land" is a
myth, due to an optical illusion. North
Stur Bay, where their ship i frozen
in, is lL'.'i miles south of Etah, and
after the party bad punctured the
story of Crocker Land, it was deter
mined to explore this section of the
country for scientific data.

Many Difficulties Overcome
It is seldom, says the" despatch,
that troops have had to combat
so many difficulties. The country,
though for the most part rough
and sandy, is broken in places by
deep tangled marshes, impassa
ble for troops and -equipment.
The weather has been hot, the
t'TYeralure ranging from ninety
to 105 in the shade at midday, and
the streams, dry at some seasons
of the year, are flooded.
Turks Face Destruction
The Turks are still occupying
positions further down the river,
along the Sanna-i-yat line, which
they have been holding for
months. Military experts and
observers here believe that it will
be impossible for them to remain
there long, unless they can crush
General Gorringe at once.
In the event that they are un
able to do this, and to fight him
means that they would have the
forces under General Lake at
their back, they will, it is assert
ed, be compelled to attempt to
withdraw their lines from the lis
Sinn positions, as well as from
those at Aanna-i-Yat, an opera
tion full of danger to their entire
army, if not certain to bring about
its destruction.
