Colonel Roosevelt h reply to the
delegation follows:
Till' Colonel's Reply.
"I am naturally very deeply touch
fd and pleased by your action. I ac
cept it absolutely in the spirit in
which you have tendered It. You
are for me because you regard me n
lepresmting and embodying the ag
gressive movement for thoroughgo
ing Americanism and thoroughgoing j
preparedness. Tour devotion is to
the cause and to the man only inso
far as he, for the time being, embod
ies the cause That is precisely the
j attitude I took in my Trinidad state
ment. I now hold, and shall con
tinue to bold this a great time of
crisis tn our country's, history, be
cause it is a great crisis In the his
tory of the world. If we are unpre
pared; if we are split and sundered
by rivalries of creed, of sectional ori
gin, if our country's action Is to be
conditioned by helplessness without
anil of the hyphenated within, the
career of the United States as a great
factor In the world's civilization Is at
an end. .
Opposed to Half MeiiMirpi.
"There is no use of being for half
measures of Americanism and pre
paredness. Still less Is it of any Uet
lor any public man to announce him
self In vaguo general terms as In fa
vor of Americanism and preparedness
unless hi whole course of action in
public life has made it evident, and
now makes It evident, that lie means
exactly what he says. Unless, if he
Is In office or has been In office, his
tareer has been such as in ruuen
measure to warrant tho belief that
he is a mun of deeds and not of words
In this matter, and unless in every
crisis, whether ho bo In or out of of-
i fice, he frankly and fully takes n
position on the concrete facts which
are up for decision, und applies tho
abstract statement directly to these
concrete farts, he Is not available.
Wants Aggressiveness.
"General professions aro utterly
worthless, in the first place, the man
making them is ready to immediately
apply Ihem to every concrete case as
II actually arises, und unless, In the
second place, when he has the op
portunity, he at once turns his words
into deeds.
"I ami fighting for these principles.
They are the principles you are or
ganising to support, and with all my
heart J welcome such support, accept
ing it as given, primarily to the prin
ciples and only secondarily for my
self. "Any man at this time of crisis who
is not aggressively, openly und spe
cifically for these principles, is
against them, and every patriotic
man should treat our public Servants
on this basis."

In the region of Verdun, both th

Interesting point In the latest French
official communication Is the state
ment that th' French have penetrated
Fort lJouamont, northeast of Verdun,
Which the Germans stormed and cap
tured February 2.1, four days after the
commencement of the assault on Ver
dun, and from which all attempts to
drive them out proved futile. The
Germans, however, still hold the
northern part of Fort Douaumont. A
violent attack also haB netted the
French several German positions on
a front of about a mile ami a quarter
east of the village cf Douaumont. To
the northeast of Verdun, the French
have forced out the Germans from po
sitions south of ilill 287 and west of
Le Mort Homme,
Guin by Germans.
Rerlin, on the other hand, says the
Germans to the northwest of Verdun
stormed the eastern spurs of Hill 304
and held them against repeated counter-attacks.
In this fighting the
French are declared to have lost heav
ily in men killed or wounded.
Admission Is made In the Rerlin
report of the capture.

Heavy losses in men were suffered

The situation generally cm the Rus

The Rritish operating against the

drawing nearer Kut-el-Amara, where
a large number of their officers and

The demand were made on the

This cavalry, after annihilating half
of a large band of Villistas ut OJos

remainder of the bandits.
( Villistas Am Cautious,
For the first week after their de
feat these Villistas never appeared In
groups of more than four, so the Am

but that the money would be given
to the original owner of the property.
Finally, Generoly Cavaaos demanded
that tho Americans retreat north

Carranza commander then reiiUMted
permission to niurch past, or through
the Americun position, to consolidate

and this was granted.

"It was by such troops that we
were told we had been threatened.
Those boys would not stand one

Immediately afler this incident on

for settlement of the Mexican bandit

Marathon, Tex., May 22. The fly
lug column of the Eighth and Four
teenth cavalry, detailed by Colonel
Frederick Funston to glv chase to
tho bandit raiders of Glenn Springs
anj Roiiulllas, have returned to Amer
ican soil near lloqultlas.
Col. Frederick V. Hlbley, command,
er of the expedition, forded the Itlo
Grande with tho two trooua of the
Fourteenth detailed to the pursuit
from Fort Clark late yesterday after
noon. MaJ. George T. Itnghorne, at
jthe head of Troop, A and II of the
jKlghth, heudiiuarter at Fort Bliaa,
i followed shortly after.
In Mexlloo Ten Day.
The expedition waa tn Mexico Just
ten days. It fulled to capture or wipe
out tlie main body of the Rig Bend
marauders, but It made prisoner of
four of the bnndlte and left behind
two other desperately wounded. In
addition It rescued Jeee Peemer, Do
qulllni storekeeper, and Monroe
! Payne, a negro, kidnaped by the Mex
icans ns they took their lairt desper
boundury.
The return of the expedition wu
Imperative for trat'pglcal reason. '. It
had penetrated so far into ' the In-te-rlor,
without , the semblance of , a
line of communication., that It wo
In danger unleim there , was no anil-'
Anii'-'enn eruption. VVItft no hope of
reinforcements, which had been de
clared unavailable, tt wus Impossible
for it to continue It fory. Then,
too, the muln object of It campaign
had been accomplished In the release
of Deemer and Payne.,
. New a Day Lair.
New of the return of Colonel 81b-
! l,y und Ma lor Uinghorne reached
j Marathon almost a day after It had
been safely accomplished. Two mov
ing picture photographers, who ac
companied the Invaders, brought tho
first, story. It wns verified later In
the day in dispatches to Capt. John
H. Chambers, base quartermaster.
According; to the information
'reaching here, Major Langhornn with
his advanced detachment penetrated
ts'lween K.O and 17G mile Into Mfx-
(1iam Itix'onie IIotnl.
After the release of Deemer and
Payne last week, some ninety mile
! from Roqulllas, Langhorne pushed
ion In pursuit of tho fleeing bandita,
, Part of his command, under Lleue-
tnnn Cramer, engaged a small hand of
the, raiders, 'capturing; six, of whom
two were wounded. It oon grew ap
parent, however, that there was no
hope of wayluylng the majority of the
raiders, as they had split up and fled
In various directions. It wn decided
to turn 'back. ' '
In Ihe meantime, Colonel Plbley,

From there, it is reported, they
proceeded In company to the border,
making the 100 miles Intervening be

i days.
! According to Captain Chambers,
.Colonel Hlbley and Major Langhorne
now are resting their commands In
camp at Roqulllas while awaltlnif

It Is not believed here

Military men In Marathon consider
the Klblcy-Lnnghnrne expedition one
of the really distinctive feats accom
plished by the American army, quite
without parallel. Major Langhorne,
(who led the advanced detachment, la
j given special credit.
I The expedition traveled ten day in
I an unknown country, over bad roads,
under a hot sun and with water
scarce. It returned Intact.
If for no other reason, the move
ment was of value because of the mil
itary knowledge gained of the coun
try south of the Rig Bend district.
Tho Rig Rend raid took place on
Friday and Saturday, May 5 and ,
The news became known Sunday, May
7. General Funston immediately or

took several day to transport troop
