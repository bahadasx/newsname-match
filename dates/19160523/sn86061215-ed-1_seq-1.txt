Marathon, Tex., May 22. —Both
Col. Sibley and Maj. Langhome
are now on the American side of
the line after their hunt for the
Glenn 8prlnga bandits.
San Antonio, Tex., Majr 22.—Some
anxiety as to the situation of the
American troops south of Boquillas
•Was displayed today at Gen. Funston's
headquarters. When last accounted
for Maj. Langhome and his two
troops of the eighth cavalry were
moving northward to Join Col. Sibley.
If it is proved that the little punitive
column is in danger, a force of the
sixth cavalry which has just arrived
in the Big Bend district will be Bent
forward as a reinforcement.
Officers at department headquarters
were inclined to regard the sniping
to which the rear guard of Gen. Per
shing's troops had been subjected as
the action of a reduced force of Vil
listas and relatively unimportant.
MINES ARE LOOTED.
151 Paso, Tex., May 22. —American
and other foreign owned mining prop
erties at Cuatro Gienegas were looted
by bandits on May IS.'
The looters previously had attacked
ir Sierra Mojado and among them were
a number of bahdtts who raided Glenn
Springs and Boquillas, Tex. After
laging the offices, houses and store
houses, they carried their booty to the
country between Cuatro Clenegas and
San Pedro, where they went intcf hid
ing.
According to the same Information,
the country between Cuatro Clenegas
which Is the birthplace and home dis
trict of Gen. Carranza, Sierra Mojada
and San Pedro contains innumerable
bandits. Up to a week ago these had
not felt the pressure of Gpn. Trevino's
trooa movements.
Advices received here say nothing
regarding the presence of Yaqui In
dians at Cuatro Clenegas as reported
In dispatches.
BATHERS FIRED ON.
Marathon) Tex., May 22.—Two
troops of the sixth cavalry withdrawn
•last week from Gen. Pershing's forces,
detrained here early today, prepara
tory to marching to Boquillas, where
they will be in a position to patrol
the border and reinforce Col. Sibley
and Maj. Langhome if necessary.
A report reached here today that
Mexican snipers fired on two Ameri
can soldiers bathing in the Rio Grande
near Deemer's ford Friday but failed
to hit them.
NOTE FROM &ARRANZA DUE.
Washington, D. C., May 22.—The
etate department has-been advised
that a new note from Gen. Carranza
on the border situation probably will
reach Washington today or tomorrow.
It will be transmitted through Eliseo
Arredondo, the Carranza ambassador.
Special Agent Rodgers at Mexico
City has been unable as yet to report
what phase of the situation has called
for the new communication.
'f Some officials believe the new note
deals with the Glenn Springs raid.
Mr. Rodgers recently was Instructed
to call the attention of the Carranza
government to the facts.
It is probable that the new Ameri
can expedition sent over the line after
the raid may be the cause of the com.
Ing note. Secretary Baker said today
that the Scott-Obregon understanding
in no way limited the pursuit of ban*
dits. Border reports insist that Col.
Sibley, commanding the expedition, is
withdrawing his forces. Secretary
Baker reiterated that Gen. Funston
had not so advised the war depart*

FIGHT IT VERDU1
BLOODY BATTLE FOR FRENCH
CITY CONTINUE8 WITH NEITHER
SIDE VICTORIOUS.
Paris, May 22.—The battle of Ver
dun enters on its fourth month today.
The Germans are hammering stubborn
ly at Dead Man hill where the most
furious fighting of the conflict has tak
en place. Clinging desperately to the
trenches they have wrested from the
French on the lower slopes of the hill,
the Teuton's have hurled 60,000 men,
backed by sixty batteries of guns of
all calibers, forward along a seven
mile front from Avocourt wood to the
Meuse In a desperate effort to seise
the coveted summit.
The Germans have succeeded in
gaining a footing in the French first
line at a cost of severe losses. How
ever, judging from the experience of
the past, it will not be a difficult task
for the French to dislodge them before
they are able to follow up their advan
tage. Both sides will then return to
their former positions to await anoth
er offensive.
That the Germans must continue
their tremendous onslaught on Dead
Man hill or abandon the idea of taking
Verdun seems obvious. This blood
soaked summit and Its sister emi
nence, Hill 304, form the key of the
whole system of Verdun's defenses.
The fire from their batteries flanks
the Douaumont plateau across the
river. Without the undisputed posses
sion of this plateau, military critics
agree that no attack on Verdun has
any chance of success.
GERMANS REPULSED.
Paris, May 22.—French grenadiers
occupied several blockhouses In Avo
court wood on the Verdun front in the
course of severe fighting last night
The struggle west of Dead Man hill
was terrific. The war office state
ment of this afternoon says that the
attacks of German infantry were re
pulsed.
The blockhouses in Avocourt wood
were abandoned by the Germans.

FIRES AT MIL
Keosauqua, May 22.—(Special): A
shooting affray disturbed the quiet of
this city Sunday afternoon when Gil
bert Offert, a young colored man from
Bloomfleld who has been working here
for some time past with Josh Johnson,
fired a shot at another young man
named Jinks Bennlngs. The shot pen
erated a door which Bennings had just
closed after fleeing the room where
the shooting occurred and he was un
hurt by the bullet.
Offert has been paying attention to
the eldest daughter of Johnson and
wished to marry the girl, Lutitia
Johnson, but she refused. He called
at the Johnson home Sunday after
noon and finding Bennings there, be
came enraged and is said to have
drawn a pistol and fired at the latter
as he fled through a door. Passing
through the door, the bullet lodged in
a chair. He is accused of saying that
none other than himself would marry
the girl and to have threatened her
life as well as that of Bennings. Two
of Johnson's daughters, who, with
their grandmother, were the only
members of the family at home, fled to
the residence of Sheriff Haney a block
away and summoned the sheriff and
his deputy, Mr. Knisey, who hastened
to the Johnson home where they dls
armed and arrested Offert.
The preliminary hearing was held
today and Offert was bound over to
await the action of the grand jury at
the August term of court.. The charge
is assault with Intent to kill.

Berlin, May 22.—Austro-Hungarian
troops have carried the peak of Armen
tara ridge, the scene of some of the
heaviest fighting in .the recently In
augurated offensive along the southern
Tyrol front. This announcement Is
made in the official Austrian report of
May 21.
More than 3.000 Italians were cap
tured on Saturday by the Austrlans,
who also obtained possession of sev
eral villages. They took twenty-five
cannon and eight machine guns, the
statement says.
REPORTS CONFLICT.
Paris, May 22.—A neutral diplomat,
who has just returned from Albania,
Is quoted in a dispatch to the Matin
from Athens as saying that the Aus?
trians have withdrawn 50,000 troops
from Albania in the last three weeks.
According to this diplomat, the Aus
trlans have left only small detach
ments to guard the towns they have
occupied. The remainder of the
troops left in the country are concen
trated at Duraszo.
The abandonoment of the Albanian
front Is said to be due to the Impossi
bility of bringing up supplies.
The statement that the Austrlans
are withdrawing their main forces
from Albania apparently conflicts
with recent dispatches from Athens
and Paris, which stated that the Ten
tons were about to launch an attack
in force against Avlona, the only town
that remains in the possession of the
Italians. On May 19 the Austrlans
were reported to have* assembled a
fleet of 150 transports at Flume to
transport troops and supplies to
Duraszo.
WAR SUMMARY.
A Russian force has joined the Brit
ish who are lighting the Turks.on the
right bank of the Tigris river, thus
achieving one of their main objects in
Asiatic Turkey. What route the Rus
sians took is not made known, the an
nouncement merely saying that a
force of cavalry after a bold and ad
venturous ride has formed a junction
with the British general, Gorrlnge, on
the Tigris In the region of Kut-El
Amara, where recently a British force
under Gen. Townshend, after a long
siege, capitulated to the Turks.
The Austrian attack against the
Italians along the -Trentino front con
tinues with great vigor according to
advices from Rome. The Austrlans
have made advances but have sustain
ed very serious losses.
The Germans attempted an offensive
against the Russians north of Lake
Ilsen but were repulsed.
The aeroplanes of the Teutonic al
lies have dropped bombs on Cairo,
Egypt, killing two and injuring
eighteen persons.
British forces in the Soudan are re
ported to have met defeat in a battle
with rebellious tribesmen in the prov
ince of Darfur.
BRITISH CAPTIVES
BEING ASSIGNED
London, May 22.—The American em
bassy' at Constantinople, which has
charge of British Interests in Turkey
during the war, sent word today of the
disposition of the British forces cap
tured by the Turks at Kut-El-Amara.
This information is contained in the
following official statement from the
British press bureau:
"Ambassador Page states that«the
American embassy at Constantinople
has been informed by the Ottolian
government that Gen. Townshend
(who was in command at Kut-El
Amara) and his staff will be brought
to Constantinople and probably will be
assigned to the Island of Prinkopo in
the Sea of Marmora, where they will
be allowed full liberty. Most of the
officers and men are still at Kut and
Bagdad. Some will be sent to Da
mascus."
BRITONS TO TAKE

COMPLETE STORY
OF IRISH REVOLT
BEING PUBLISHED
INABILITY OF GERMANSTO CARRY
OUT THEIR PART OF PLAN,
CAUSES FAILURE.
London, May
9.—(Correspondence
of
The Associated Press)—This is the
history as told by authorities here of
the widespread plot which resulted in
the 111 fated uprising in Ireland which
plunged the Emerald isle for a period
Into a reign of bloodshed and destruc
tion. It is a story to the effect that
the Seln Finn organization was used
as a pawn In the game played by
Berlin, and revolutionists In America,
and of how the failure of the revolt
was made doubly sure by the Inability
of Germany to carry out Important
features of the plan. These facts
have been gathered from authentic
British sources and are presented un
der the eensorshlp.
The plot had its inception shortly
after the beginning of the war when
certain Irishmen and German author
ities conceived the idea of utilising the
Seln Finn organization for a revolt—
the Germans being actuated by the
purpose of weakening Great Britain
and the others having a desire to ob
tain revenge for alleged political
wrongs. At that time the Sinn Fein
ers who had organized because of jeal
ously of nationalist volunteers had no
definite idea of starting a revolt. They
accepted the plan, however, and event
ually fell victims to the scheme.
The name of Sir Roger Casement
appears prominently throughout the
story.
Money From Germans.
Sir Roger went from America to
Christiania late In 1914 under an as
sumed name. He conferred with the
German consul and proceeded to Ger
many. Coincident with his arrival In
Berlin certain officials placed their
guarantees of assistance back of an
Irish rebellion. It was thought a
revolution could be successful and
plans for furthering the movement
were made. According to this account
Germany agreed to furnish money,
arms and men,to assist the Sin Feln
ers and is said to have agreed to an
invasJtowof England which would pre
vent soldiers being sent into Ireland
by the British.
America was made the medtum of
communication between Berlin and
Ireland. Certain Irishmen In the Uni
ted States enlisted their services and
Captains Boy-Ed and Von Papen, the
then German naval and military at
taches at Washington, together with
numerous others, some of whom are
now under arrest In America, are said
to have done their part In furthering
the plans. The carrying of funds and
information to the Sinn Felners was
done largely by Irish sympathizers in
Ameripa who were able to visit their
home land without question.
Shortly after Casement's arrival In
Germany he published charges that the
British minister at Christiania had
tried to have him assassinated. His
accusations against the British minis
ter are said to have been the Initial
step in a publicity campaign to gain
sympathy.
Tampers With Captives.
The next intelligence received in
London concerning Sir Roger was
brought by returning soldiers who re
ported that he was trying to recruit
Irish soldiers from prison camps to
fight against England. Some men
agreed to his proposition, were given
freedom and furnished with the green
uniform of the Sinn Feiners. The plot
ting went on until November, 1915.
Then there was a lull. The Germans
had grown tired of Casement. Case
ment himself retired to Munich, where
it was reported he was in poor health.

JOHN P.IRISH
TO SPEAK HERE
Noted Orator From Coast Is
Coming to Ottumwa for
Anti-Suffrage Meet
FORMER IOWAN WILL
TALK IN OPERA HOUSE
Making Three Weeks Tour
ill the State to Oppose
Votes for Women
The committee of women In charge
of the campaign in opposition to wom
an suffrage in Ottumwa has received
notice of the first anti-suffrage speaker
of note to visit here before the June
primary. John P. Irish, famous as an
orator, is a native Iowan, for many
years a resident of this state and fori
mer editor at Iowa Oity, but for sev
eral years past a resident of Califor
nia. Mr. Irish speaks at amass meet
ing to be held In the Grand opera
house Tuesday evening, to which all
the voters as well as the women of
Ottumwa and vicinity are Invited.
The local committee considers itself
fortunate In securing a speaker of the
character of John P. Irish, who Is well
known not only In Iowa but nationally
as an orator of unusual power.' His
platform work in the campaign of
1896 when he advocated the gold
standard during that great political
fight in which free silver vs. the gold
standard was the main issue, won
national reputation for the former
Iowan. For many years he was col
lector of the port of San Francisco and
bases his opposition to woman suf
frage on his experience In California
where the women have the vote. The
anti-suffrage movement has a cham
pion in Mr. Irish, who has left his
home on the coast for three weeks'
tour of Iowa to assist in keeping Iowa
out of the list of suffrage states. The
local committee In charge of the op
position to suffrage looks forward to
a big meeting at the opera house
T*ue«dajr night.
Mr. Irish will arrive here Tuesday
morning over the Milwaukee and will
be at the Ballingall hotel throughout
the day. He will be glad to meet his
old friends and others while in the
city.

PREPONDERENCE OF EXPORTS
OVER IMPORTS CAUSES THE
RATES TO DROP.
Stockholm, May 11. (Correspon
dence of The Associated Press)—
The American dollar has been steadily
declining on the Scandinavian bourses
until on May 10 the drop represented
a loss of 12 per cent, more than half
of which has occurred In the last two
months. The normal value of the
dollar In Stockholm and the other
Scandinavian capitals is three kroner
and severity-one ore. It was quoted
today on 'change at S.28, whereas,
only 8.20 was paid at banks on Amer
ican dollar drafts.
This condition is partly accounted
for by the fact that the Germans have
recently dumped a great quantity of
American money and bills receivable
on Che Stockholm market. It is be
lieved, however, that it is principally
due to the falling off in American
trade during the past six months owing
to the difficulty and danger In trans
ferring money. The seizure and hold
ing up of malls 1b also a factor.
Letters reaching Stockholm today
were mailed In New York seven weeks
ago. As malls to America are stop
ped also by the British patrol boats
and the .letters censored in England,
merchants must figure on three and a
half months on an exchange of let
ters.
The English pound sterling has been
leading the dollar downward. From
the normal eighteen kroner and
twenty ore, It was quoted today at
15.42, while still less was paid on ex
change, a loss of more than 15 per
cent. German marks showed a loss of
more than 30 per cent. They havn
dropped from a normal price of ninety
kroner a hundred to 60.80. The Rus
sian ruble and the Austrian crown are
worth'today about half their normal
value and the French franc is 25 per
cent under par.
Sweden's exports which aTe princi
pally to Russia and Germany are now
far in excess of Imports and this part
ly accounts for,the low value of for
eign exchange. This condition has
helped to augment the great prosper
ity which is prevailing throughout this
country as well as all Scandinavia.
KN PBDTESTJS DM
Another Note Will Be Sent to Great
Britain Regarding 8eizure of
American Mall.
Washington, D. C., May 22.—The
new note to Great Britain, making fur
ther protest against Interference with
American malls, was laid before
President Wilson today and probably
will be sent to London tomorrow. The
general terms of the note were fram
ed at the state department but the
president is including some of his own
language.
The note is understood to protest
particularly against the taking of ves
sels into British ports and there exam
lng and detaining mall going to and
from the United States. The American
note will make plain that the United
States can not consent to continu
ance of the policy to which it already

HEAVY OWING
London, May 11.—(Correspondence
of The Associated Press)—The aston
ishing success of the central control
board in reducing the drink evil in
England, Scotland and Wales since
the board's inauguration in June, 1915,
is strikingly shown in the second re
port made by its chairman, Lord
d'Abernon.
The report shows that the efforts of
the board have resulted In a reduction
of the average weekly number of con
victions for drunkenness In England
and- Wales from 2,084 in 1914 to 940
for last March, the latest month for
which figures are available. In Scot
land the average has been reduced
from 1,424 in 1914 to 794 for March.
The figures for London, where a
no treating" order went into effect
on October 11, 1915, show the weekly
average of convictions for the metro
politan district in 1914 was 1,301. This
was reduced to 1,008 for the four
weeks prior to October 11, and in the
succeeding month dropped to 718.
Reductions on a similar scale were
shown in the great industrial centers
of Liverpool, Birmingham and Man
chester.
The board has been especially active
in looking after the great army of
workers who are employed in the mu
nitions industry.
