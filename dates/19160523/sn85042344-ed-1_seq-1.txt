by District Attorney Edward Swann
in his opening address for the ate.
The trial, which began shortly after
10 oclock this morning, moved rapidly.
A Jury was selected In less than three
hours and the district attorney con
sumed only half an hour In his formal
presentation of the state's case. Mean
time Waite. who was neatly dressed
in a blue suit and sat by his counsel,
appeared as much unmoved as the
most disinterested speutaator In the
courtroom.
Present Case.
Aside from the address from the
district attorney. In which he reolted
Waitcs life history and gave a com
plete resume of the events leading up
to the crime to which Wait already
has confessed, the outstanding feature
of the trial today was the testimony
of Dr. Albertus Adair Moore. Waite,
the witness declared, admitted to him
lie had purchased arsenic for his 11-year-old
futhcr-ln-luw "because tho
old gentleman didn't want to live.
Previously when suspicion was first
directed against Waite, Doctor Moore
siild the accused dentist had tele
phoned him and asked him if he
(Moore) thought "they could hold him
Waite for the death of Mr. Peek
because a nurse had not been engaged
to attend the aged victim."
"Waite asked me," said Doctor
Moore "If arsenic administered be
fore death would Bhow in an autopsy
as distinguished from the same poison
when used In embalming fluid,"
The witness said he replied that the
poison would be discernible In the
brain if administered before death.
" Insanity I'lou.
Waite's counsel Intimated that they
would rely entirely upon a plea of In
sunity to save their client from the
electric chair. To combat testimony
that probably will be given tomorrow
by alienists both from this city and
Grand Kupilds in support of the prose
cution's Contention that Waite was
sane and his crime uctuated by a
desire for money, the defense an
nounced tonight that one or more
alienist fVuld be called by them.
NelthV.VIrs. Clara Louise Peck
Wuite, wife of the prisoner, nor Mrs.
Margaret llurton, his companion in a
"studio" here, were present at the
trial todav. lloth. however, will testify
against Waite, the district attorney an
nounced. Mrs. Waite probably will go
on the stand Wednesday. Her brother,
Percy Peck, will precede her.

Main Object Accomplished

MAIiATIIo.N. Texas. May 22. Tho
flying columns of the Kighth

Major-i icneral Crederick Kunston to
give chase to the bandit raiders of
Glenn Springs anil l:oiiiillas, have re

to the pursuit from Kurt Clary late
yesterday. Major George T. Lang

of Kighth. headipiarters nt Kort llliss,
followed shorlly afterward.
The ixpcilition wus in Mexico Just
ten davs. It failed to capture or
wipe out the main body of the llig
Ili-fid marauders, but It made prison
ers of four of the bandits n nil left
behind two others desperately wound
ed In addition it rescued Jesse
Oeemer. Iloiiuillus storekeeper, and
Monroe Payne, a negro, kidnaped by
the Mexicans us they took their last
desperate swing before fleeing beyonU
the border.
Had to Itetiirn.
Tho return of the expedition was
miprrutlvo for strategical reasons. It
brnl penerated so far Into tho Interior
without the semblance of a line of
communication that it was not pre
pared for possible eventualities. With
no hope of reinforcements, which had
born declared unavailable, It was im
possible for it to contineu its foray.
Then, loo, the main object of its cam
paign had been accomplished in the
release of I loonier nnd Payne.
News of tho return of Colonel Sib
ley and Major lingborne reached
Marathon almost a day it I ter it had
been safely accomplished. Two moving
picture photographers, who aceou
paniod tho invaders, brought the first
story. It was verified later in the day
in dispatches to Captain John S.
Chambers, base quartermaster.

Colonel Sibley, taking an easier pare
was well to bis rear at all times In a
iiosillon either to push forward to his
aid or to cut off any enemy that might
try a flank movement.
Shot After llaiiilits.
Alter the release of Oeemer and
Payne last week, some ninety miles
from Hoqulllas, linghorne pushed on
in pursuit of tho fleeing bandits. Part
in Ills command minor i.iohicioiui
Cramer engaged a small band of tho
raiders, capturing six of whom two
wore wounded. It soon a row appar
ent, however, that there was no hope
for waylaying the majority of the
raliiers us they bud split up und tied
in various directions. It wus decided
to turn back.
In the meantime Colonel Sibley,
well In the rear, is supposed to have
received reports that a lorco of Yuqul
Indians was getting perilously near to
the advanced detachment. Whether
or not there was good ground for be
lieving those reports, it Is not known
here. At unv rate Colonel Sibley
marched forward and it appears, from
tho information brought to Marathon,
joined Maior l-anghorno lit Kl Pino.
From there, It Is reported, they
proceeded In company to the bor

According to Captain Chambers.
Colonel Siblev and Major Lungborne
now are resting their commands in
camp at llmiuillas while awaiting
further orders. It Is not believed
here that they will go hue Into
Mexico for tho present at least.

Tho expedition traveled ten days
in an unknown country, over bad
roads, under a hot son and with

The movement was suid to be of
