digging a wagon load of dirt out of
the side of a mound in Illinois, ten
miles from St. Louis, uncovered a
sekelton. He hurried to a neighbor's
and together they dug deeper and
before they had .finished they un
earthed 100 skeletons, believed to be
of a prehistoric race.
The news spread and hundreds cf
persons visited the scene where th
diggers are still at work and unearth
ing more skeletons. It is believed
the farmer stumbled on the burial
place of a race which lived thou
sands of years ago.
. From the appearance of the skele
tons they appear to have lain in the
ground for ages. It is believed to ne
the biggest of prehistoric finds in
years.
More mounds are to be investigated.
More than 200 men are engaged in
looking for "finds."

CITIZENS HEAR OF CONTROVER
SY EETWEEN JUDGE FREEMAN
AND BUD BALLEW PASS RESOLUTIONS.
A good sized audience assembled at
the t;.Jicrmi"U last night to hear the
proceedings of the meeting called by
the Aldmnre Pastors' association to
lake laition in the Freeman irallew
controversy, which has agitated the
minds of the citizens since its oc
currence Saturday evening.
iter. C. C. Weilh opened the meet
ing and brielly stated its object, lie
sugs-f .-tel th;it a permanent organiza
tion, be perfected, whereupon W. I.
('nice was placed in nomination for
chairman and elected by unanimous
const nt. Dr. J. F. Young was cho
sen as secretary.
Dr. Welch, pastor of the Broadway
Methodist, church, was called and
read a statement from Judge Free
man, which purported to be the facb
in the case, as they occurred. This
statement was branded as false by
BaHew a little later in the meeting.
U . Welch stated that the circum
stances demanded drastic action, the
removal of Ballew from office and a
vigorous prosecution of his case, and
suggested that, the people express
their indignation against the attack
on Judge Freeman In vigorous terms.
Dr. Cooper of the Broadway Baptist
church addressed the audience to
some length and denounced the ac
tion of Ballew in assaulting the dis
trict judge, averring that it was not
only a personal assault by one man
upon another but a blow nt the judic
iary of the country, and if permitted
to go on would eventually lead to an
archy. At the conclusion of Br. Cooper's
remarks, Ballew, who was present,
asked to be beard and stated that in
asmuch as there was always two
sides to a question he thought he
should be accorded the privilege. He
started by branding the written state
men of Judge Freeman, read by Hev.
Welch, as false, and further stated
that the direct cause cf his slapping
Judge Freeman was because be called
him a vile name. Ballew was not
permitted to proceed on account of
his manner of expression, and for a
few moments considerable excitement
prevailed, ninny leaving the audience
and going to their homes. Order was
finally restored. Sheriff (Jarrett'a aid
was invoked, and Dr. J. F. Young
made a fair, straightforward address
to the audience, stating that Mr. Bal
lew had a right to be heard, as he
was the party most concerned, and
urged the people to be fair in deal
ing with him -as with any other man.
His remarks had a quieting effect
upon the people, who were beginning
to wonder what the real object of the
meeting was. Vp to this time the
meeting did not seem to be "getting
anywhere" and L. S. Dolman injected
a little business into it by suggesting
that a committee of three be appoint
ed to draft proper resolutions de
nouncing the attack upon the judic
iary of the county and state. This
committee was composed of Dr. J. F.
Young, Thomas Norman and L. S.
Dolman, who retired to prepare the
resolution.
While the committee was out. Dr.
Williams was called. He addressed
the audience upon the subject of law
enforcement and good government.
Dr. Williams stated that he deplored
the incident, and hoped that the good
people of this city and county would
see that proper reparation was made.
Th? committee on resolutions an
nounced at this point that it was
ready to report, and the following
resolution was read and adopted:
The Resolution.
"W'e, your committee appointed to
draft resolutions, beg to report as
