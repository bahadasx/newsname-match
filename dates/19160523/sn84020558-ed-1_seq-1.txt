WASHINGTON. May 22. The eco
nomic situation in Mexico was extreme
ly grave according to officials advices
today to the state department With
the Monetary problem already acute,
the food shortage in Mexico ( ity and
icinity continuing without prospect of
my immediate relict and with the
labor strike extending over practically
all the Mexican railway lines the de
facto government is pictured as facing
serious domestic plight.
First hand reports as to the situa
tion in northern Mexico will reach the
lepartment tomorrow. Consul Letch -
from Chihuahua City, is enrottte to
Washington preaumbably bringing
with him a synopsis of the reports of
ive other consuls recently ordered to
the border to talk over conditions with
military officials there.
It was officially stated that while
Mr. Letcher would make bis report on
onditions in Mexico, that was DOl the
lole purpose of his trip. It was ex
plained he was ordered here that rout
ine matters might be taken up with
him. but no inkling of their nature
wa-s given out.
Thp department today received fur
ther advices from Special Agent Bodg-
ers at Mexico t ity letting ot tne new
that was in process of prepara
tion by the de facto government: but
the message threw no light on its
purpose. Tile communication will be
handed to Secretary Lansing by Kliseo
Arredoudo, Aaahasaador-designate, but
the embassy, so far lias no knowledge
f the matter. .Mr. Rodgers' last mes
age indicated that the note had not
been sent forward and might not be
sent fur a day or so.
While reports as to the domestic
situation of the Carrauza government
are gloomy, the attitude of Mexican
officials towards the United States
has been described as more friendly
since the border conference between
General Scott and General Obregon.
It is believed possible this will lie re
flected in the new note, although some
officials think it probable that a new
request for withdrawal of the Ameri
can expeditionary forces will be includ
ed with whatever other proposals Gen
eral Carrauza has to make.
Since the state department's repre
sentations as to the renewed raiding
in the Big Bend countrv of Texas have
not been answered the note is expect
ed to go into that subject. Officials
here, including Secfetary Baker, say
the military conference on the border
left the situation unchanged as to
steps to lie taken with regard to new
raids. The state department position
is that the original agreement proposed
hy General Carrauza anil accepted by
Secretary lousing, fully covers Colonel
Sibley's drive into Mexico after the
Boqufllas raiders. The Washington
government still is proceeding on the
theory that the right to follow hot
trails across the border has been es- j
litblished and General V iinston s in
structions are based on this view.
Reports from General Funston that
lit; members of the Texas national
uard had refused to take the muster

FIELD HEADQUARTERS, May 17.
(Via wireless to Columbus. N. Ii., May

from far southern marches, brought
news of brusque demands made upon
them by General Oav&sos, the Carran
.a officer in command of .several thou
sand men now poiicing the section of
Chihuahua from ParrsJ northward to
San Antonio.
The demands were made on the Kiev -enth
cavalry, in command of Major
Robert L. Hoze a few days ago. This
cavalry, after annihilating half of a
large band of Villistas at Ojus Aznles,
was resting south of San Antonio,
making ready to clean up the remaind
er of the bandits.
For the first week after their defeat
these Villistas never appeared in
groups of more than four, so the Ameri
cans played a waiting game. General
i avazos demanded rrom Major rioze
ihe corn which the American troopers
had seized from the defeated Villistas.
Next the Carrauza leader demanded
that he be given the horses which thej
Americans had taken. He was inform
ed that any property would be paid
for in full, but that the money would
be given to the original owner of the
property.
Finally General Cavazos demanded
that the Americans retreat northward
This was refused flatly. The Carrau
za commander then requested permis
sion to march past, -: through the
American position to consolidate his
command with reinforcements and
this was granted.
The Americans were drawn up on
the crest of a hill when the Carran
zistas marched past. A bearded
American soldier, father of a family,
who watched them, said today: "1 am
