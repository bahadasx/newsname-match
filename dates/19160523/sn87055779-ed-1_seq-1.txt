Nation Now Having
Its "Dark Hour."
iDterii.itioiJHl News ?erYbe:
HOME, May 23. Italy is having
her "dark hour," hut every one in
the kingdom is assured that victory
will ultimately crown Italian arms.
Italy had more than one aim when
she went to war on the side of the
allies. The chief objects which the
government had in view when it de
cided to cu&t its lot with the entente
were these:
1. Iledernption of provinces hold
by Austria.
2. Ls.tablLshment of the "open
door" in the Palkans.
Ö. Absolute control of the Adri
atic. 4. Destruction of the commercial
alliance between the central powers
and the near east which was work
ing to the detriment of Italy.
To thete is now added:
o. Restoration of the idependence
of Serbia.
) TtlU Italy's Position.
Prince Peter Ii S-ne a member
of the chamber of deputies and fr
many years under secretary of state
lor foreign affairs, who has been
righting at the front. Rave this state
ment on Italy's position in the war
during a visit he has just made to
Home on leave of absence:
"Italy was one of the last of the
big powers to enter the war and she
may be one of the last, to lay down
arms. To our previous aims (chief
of which was the redemption of
Italian provinces) the resurrection
of the kingdom of Serbia has now
become one of the main scopes of
Italy's war.
"When the territorial changes
which followed the second Lulkan
war seemed to thwart forever
Serbia's plan of reaching the open
sa. a German syndicate bought the
roads running into the territories
which, by right of conquest would
have been awarded to Serbia, Greece
and liulgaria. Italy insisted that
the.-e trunk lines be turned over to
their new proprietors.
"This proposal was still th sub
ject of lively diplomatic negotiations
when the war broke out.
Formidable Jrh!cni.
"The problem of future Italian
Serbian relations is formidable and
It is impossible to tell how it will be
solved. Naturally Serbia's claim on
Tvilmatia is absurd. Ialmatia is
Ye..dian. heme Yenetian by tradi
tion. "Mr. Patiseh. the Serbian pre
mier, w now visiting the capitals of
Kurope in order to secure diplomatic
support to Serbia's ebiim on Dal
matia. The English radicals have
received his views with enthusiasm.
Thev seem to overlook the fact that
there i; no place for two nations in
the Adriatic and that the Adriatic
w?s not even large enough for the
Yenetian republic.
""We are righting to secure the ab
solute control of the Adriatic. If
victorious we shall prevent any
other nation taking the place of our
traditional er.emy
W'lat we shall
do and do gladly :s t grant Setbi i
nn o;tlot r th It .ill t-e to
her inivantacr aj well as to ours."
Prince Pi Scabs declared that Or-
rrany and Austria are s'rivln? for
th i omplet economic domination of
the Halkans.

This is the third case resulting

Two of the defendants arrested

Professional and
Business Men May
Join the Militia
What limy eventually result in an
other company of national guard n
South P.end, is being planned by a
number of prominent young profes
sional and business men in the city.
A decision on the matter will be
reached this week.
At cording to the tentative plan.?,
it is believed that a hodv of voung
men will be enrolled to form a com
pany, u hit h will be entitled to state
aid. c'apt. l. K. Stogsilall. com
mandant of the Notre Dame cadets,
has agreed to act as commander
and drill master temporarily.
The mass of the recruits, if is ex
pected, will be tlrawn from the South
Uend Hitle club, a local organization,
which has been successfully carry
ins out a small preparedness pro
gram of its own for the past car. It
is planne, io drill those who enli.T.
bist in the rudiments of army tac
tics, following later with instruc
tion in fi?hi activities. This latter
will be carried out only after the
preliminary instruction has leen
Civ en.
The idea of the new organization
is not to supplant the present Co.
P.. which lias recently been refused
federal aid because f it.s failure to
maintain a certain standard, but vviii
act independent of that organization,
save to become a part of the state
oldiery. The idea of forming a
company from oung business raen. it
is reported, has taken well, and it is
assured little trouble in enlisting the
minimum number of troops for a
company, is expected.
With the assistance of C'apt. Stogs
dall. those who ate backing the plan,
hope to make the South Pend or
ganization one of the crack compan
ies in the state. Thev expect to
carry on the instruction further than
is ordinarily given national guard
cmpanies. perfecting the recruits in
the higher branches of held work,
so that they will be '.eil prepared for
service in the eent of war.

Within a week Dr. C. S. F.osen

ulated his plans for carrying out the
housing survey of the city, the funds
for which were supplied by the city
council at its meeting Monday even

commission of five members to con
sist of the building inspector, the
secretary of the health board and a
representative from the Chamber of
Commerce, the Federation of Civic
clubs and the Woman's Civic league,
to whom will be submitted at least
once a week a report from the work
ers hired to make the survey. The
commission will return a recom
mendation to the health board upon
whom will then fall the duty of en
forcing the law in respect to each
case.
It is the purpose of the health
hoard to carry on the survey
through local people. None of the

outsiders into the city. It is prob

duty it will be to t-erve notice upon
owners or occupants of Insanitary

NKW VOKK. May l'ö. Showers
and chill breezes marred the pleas
ure r bans of the delegates coio en
tratirg here today for the i:;th bi
ennial convention of the Ceneral
Federation of Women's clubs, but the
unfavorable weather conditions
caused no decrease in the heat of
the political campaign that is being
wagei about the two women who are
candidates for the federation's, pres
idency. Th-i candidates are Mrs. J. P.
Fowles of Pos Angeles, Calif., and
Mrs. Samuel p. Fneath. of Tiilin. O.
Their rivalry is a friendly one, but
none the less intense because the
bitterness that usually marks polit
ical campaigns is lac king. The sup
porters of both claim victory is as
sured, but they overlook no argu
ment that will gain votes for their
candidate.
A merry hnttl is in progress to
day in an effort to clinch the sup
port of Herschfl T. Smith of Fulton.

registered. He is an alternate for
his vife and has a knowledge of
polities that both the fowles and

he is willing to advocate the val:e of

Efforts to Stage Contest For
Vice Presidential Nomina

International News Service:
WASHINGTON. May Efforts
to create "atmosphere" in the dem
ccratic national eomention by stak
ing a contest for the vice presiden
tial nomination at St. Louis are
doomed to failure, although friends
(ii certain western possibilities are
loudly shouting their availability. It
was learned today that Pres't Wilson
will stand squarely behind Vice
Pres't Thomas K. Marshall. There
are two Pnited States senators to be
elected from Indiana this year and
the president is fully convinced, it
i.- learned, that the presence of Mr.
Marshall on the national ticket will
be most essential for party success
tbere. It is expected that he will
write a letter before the onvntion
meets, in which he will express tho
hTv that the vice president will
a;ain be his running mate.

.Meanwhile the prospect of lh
Honor question being injected into

and other organizations favoring
the abolishment of the saloons, plan
t go to Chicago very early to ap

to St. Louis to tell the democratic
platform shapers that national pro

at St . Louis, unle-s all siu-ns fail,
they will have the assistance of Col.

campaign was hardly the time to

holding that the great mass of e n

opportunity to demonstrate it
