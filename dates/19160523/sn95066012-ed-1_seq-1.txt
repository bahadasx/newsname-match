London, May 23. A dispatch receiv
ed from Lieut-Gen Sir Percy Lake,
commander of. the British forces in
Mesopotamia, shows that the forces of
Lieut-Gen. Sir George (lorrings, oper
ating on the south hank of the Tigris,
have now virtually reached Kut-el-Amara,
the region now being clear of
Turks up to the junction of the Shatt
el Hal river with the Tigris at, Kut.
On the north hank of the Tigris, to the
east of Kut-el-Amara, however, the
Turks still occupy Sannayyat. An of
ficial communication issued last night
concerning the operations in this re
gion says:
"Gen Lake reports on May 20 that
the right or south bank of the Tigris
is clear of the enemy as far as the
Shatt el llai, except for small rear
guards covering the bridge over the
liai some 500 yards below its junction
with the Tigris. Our main force on
this bank has reached the line of
Magasis-Dujailam. On the left, or
north bank, the enemy is reported still
occupying the Sannayyat position. The
weather is intensely hot and trying.
The temperature during the last few
days was over 100 degrees in the

VERMONT FARMS
Bailey Book Offers Bargains from $750
to $24,000.
An attractive pamphlet has been
issued from the ortlee of the secretary
of state, containing a descriptive list,
with prices, of Vermont farms and
residential .properties offered for sale.
The smallest farm offered in the
pamphlet is of one acre and the larg
est 2,400. The smaller one, with house
and two barns, three miles from rail
road station and postollice, is offered
for $750. It costs more money to buy
the large one $24,000. Hut this after
all is only $10 an acre and there is a
fine house, 10 barns and no end of out
buildings, with 500 acres of tillage
land.
Several farms are described as aban
doned farms. But there must 'be a
string to them tor in each case the
buildings are described as in "fair re
pair" and in three cases telephones
are in the house.
Some of the descriptions are at
tractive enough to make the city dwel
ler dash off to the spot without a mo
ment's warning, to live the rest of his
life and die in the midst of such charm
ing surroundings. We hope ihey will
have a similar effect on people outside
the state, for whoso welfare the pamph
let Is more especially designed. LU:rl

French Claim Germans Hold Only
One Corner of Fortress
GERMANS STICK TO KILL 304
Berlin Asserts Attacks of French
Regain Captured Ground
Failed.
to
Paris, May 23. The trl-eolor is fly
ing everywhere in l'aris today in hon
or of the French victory at Fort Douau
mont where lost ground was regained
in a brilliant attack. The French, the
war office announces, now hold all but
a corner of the fortress.
Gains by the French were offset to
some extent by the news of British
reverses at Ziniy ridge.
London, May 2X In the region of
Verdun both the French and Germans
claim successes for their arms at vari
ous points. An interesting point in the
latest French ollicial communication is
the statement that the French have
penetrated Fort Douauniont. northeast
of Verdun, which the Germans stormed
and captured February 25, four days
after the start of the assault on Verdun
and from which all attempts to drive
them out proved futile. The Germans
however, still hold the northern part
of Fort Douauniont.
A violent attack also has netted
the French German positions on a
front of about a mile and a quarter
east of the village of Douauniont. To
the northwest of Verdun the French
have forced out the Germans from
positions south of hill 2N7 and west
of Le Mort Homme.
Berlin, on the other hand, says the
Germans northwest of Verdun stormed
the eastern spurs of hill 304 and held
them against repeated counterat
tacks. In this fighting the French
are declared to nave lost Heavily in
men killed or wounded. Admission is
made in the Berlin report of the cap
ture by the French of a quarry south
of Ilaiidromont, northeast of Verdun.
TEN YEARS FOR LYNCH
Death Sentence Commuted
to
Imprisonment.
London, May 23. Jeremiah C. Lynch
the naturalized American who was sen
tented to 10-years' imprisonment by a
court-martial at Dublin last week for
complicity in (lie Irish rebellion, was
originally sentenced to death. The
Britisli military authorities commuted
tile death sentence to 10 years' im
prisonment after consideration of a re
quest from the state department at
Washington that the convicted man be
not executed.
Embassador Page yesterday cabled
the state department that he had been
officially advised by the British govern
ment that Lynch had originally been
sentenced to death, but that the sen
tence had been commuted to 10-years'
imprisonment. Comlirmation of the
10-ycars sentence given Lynch also
was sent by American Consul Adams
at Dublin.
Embassador Page said he was offi
cially informed by the home office at
London that the death sentence had
flrct been imposed upon Lynch. There
is nothing in the message to indicate
whether the representations ordered
by Piesident Wilson In Lynch's behalf
had resulted In the commutation of
sentence.
Embassador Page also reported that
John J. Kilgallon of Long Island City,
N. Y., whose father asked the state
department to intervene in Ills behalf.
Is interned In a camp at Stafford,
Eng. Mr. Page said he hoped soon to
secure Kilgallon's release.

WAITE DEFENCE INSANITY
New York Dentist on Trial for Murder
ing Father-in-Law.
New York. May 22. Dr. Arthur War
ren Waile, the young dentist and ten
nis player, who was placed on trial to
day before Justice Clarence J. Sliearn
and a Jury In the criminal branch of
the supreme court, charged witli the
murder of his wealthy father-in-law.
John E. Peck of Grand Rapids, Mich.,
not only administered deadly disease
germs and poison to his victim, but
applied chloroform to his nostrils until
he died, it was alleged by District
Attorney Edward Swann In his open
ing address for the state.
The trial, which began shortly after
10 o'clock this morning, moved rapidly.
A jury was selected in less than three
hours, and the district attorney con
sumed only half an hour In his formal
presentation of the State's case.
Meantime, Waite. who was neatly
dressed in a blue suit ami Fat by his
counsel, appeared us much unmoved as
the most disinterested spectator in the
court room.
Aside from the address of the dis
trict attorney, in which he recited
Walte's life history and gave a com
plete resume of the circumstances lead
Ing up to the crime to which Waite al
ready has confessed, the outstanding
feature of the trial today was the
testimony of Dr. Albertus Adair
Moore. Waite. the witness declared.
admitted to him that lie had purchased
arsenic for his 72-year-old father-in-law
because the old gentleman did not
want to live."
Walte's counsel intimated that they
would rely entirely on a plea of In
sanity to save their client from the
electric chair. To combat testimony
that probably will bn given tomorrow
bv alienists both from this city ami
Grand Rapids in support of the prose
cutions contention that Waite was
sane and his crime actuated by a de
sire for money, the defense announced
tonight that one or more alienists
would be called by them.
Neither Mrs. Clara Louise Peck
Waite, wife of the prisoner, nor Mrs.
Margaret llorton. his companion in a
"studio" here were present at the trial
today. Both, however, will testify
against Waite, the district attorney an
nounced. Mrs. Waite probably will go
on tho witness stand Wednesday morn
ing. Her brother, Percy Peck, will pre
eedo her.

Editor of the Banner: It Is with
great pleasuie that 1 await each Friday
the arrival of the weekly Banner,
which brings me news from my boy
hood home and I read w ith unusual in
terest the articles upon the old homes
on the hill and the families now gone

however, which 1 take, the liberty of
correcting. You pay in paragraph
seven, "Deacon Lyman married twice,''
whereas he was married three times.
His first wife was Miss Jane Bloom,
daughter of Sylvester Bloom. She died
in 1S22, at the age of 23, and Deacon
Lyman is burled by her side in the old
emetery on tho hill.
1 rejoice that the old house has
passed into such excellent hands and
trust that it may long sf and for fuiure
residents of Bennington to see and en
joy. 1 here are few enough of our old
landmarks left, and I have clways re
gretted the fact that the only histori
cal building on the monument grounds,

Their Defeat by Austria Assumes
Serious Proportions
ROME CLAIMS LIMIT REACHED
Teuton Advance Checked and at Some
Points Has Been Thrown
Back.
Vienna, May 23. The Italians have
been driven from their entire position
on Lavarond Plateau, the Austrian war
office announced yesterday. It is stat
ed t hat the Italian defeat Is steadily be
coming more serious. The Austrian
lines have been pushed forward rapid
ly, several additional positions of
strategic importance having been cap
tured. The number of Italians taken
prisoner lias been increased to 23,-
8S3.
According to the Austrian report of
Sunday, Austro-Ilungarian troops have
carried the peak of Armentara ridge,
the scene of the heaviest fighting in
the recently-inaugurated offensive
along the southern Tyron front. More
than 3omi Italians were captured on
Saturday by the Austrians. w ho also ob
tained possession of several villages.
'I hey took 'J." cannon and eight ma
chine guns, the statement says.
Rome. May 23. Austrian artillery of
all sizes and all ranges, with t he mon
ster 30r-milli meter gun predominat
ing, has transformed the battle front
between the Adige and Brenta rivers in
to an Inferno. Notwithstanding the
snow-capped mountain barriers, the
Austrian infantry is being launched in
waves which, military observers say,
break against the formidable resist
ance of the Italians.
The Italian troops have now formed
their lines of defense and are holding
firmly all the passes and peaks from
which, Italian officers say, " the for
ward movement of the Austrians has
not only been successfully arrested but
the Austrians have been dislodged
from several strategic positions taken
in the first tush of the olfensive.
There are several indications to con
firm the statement that the design of
the present strenuous campaign of the
Austrians on the Trentino front is to
prevent Italy from participating with
lier troops in the struggle on the
French front, and also to paralyze any
action aiming at the joining of the
Avlona and Salonica forces for a simul
taneous effort.
BIG NOISE AT CHICAGO
More than a Hundred Bands

Chicago, May 22. Indications are
that the Republican national conven

and most exciting In the history of the

president in the field and with the re
sult in doubt until the last ballot has

usual amount of noise and enthusiasm.
Fred M. I'phani, chairman of the lo

fifty glee and marching clubs to Chic

Informed of Organization

RESTATES HIS PRINCIPLES
Career of United States as World
Power Must End Unless There Is
Unity.
Oyster Bay, N. V., May 23 In reply
to George von L. Meyer, former secre
tary ol the navy, who yesterday of
ficially notified him that the Roose
velt republican committee, with mem
bership in 30 states, had been organ
ized to work for his nomination for
the presidency by the republican
party, Col. Theodore Roosevelt enu
merated the principles for which he
declared be was fighting.
Mr. Meyer headed a delegation of 25
members of the committee. In his
speech of notification lie told Mr,
Roosevelt that one of the purposes of
the committee was to "aid the re
publican party in going before the
country reunited and in full strength
with a candidate who is listened to
and trusted by the great mass of the
people."
Col. Roosevelt's reply to the delega
tion follows:
"I am naturally very deeply touched
and pleased by your action. I accept
it absolutely in the spirit which you
have taken it. You are for nie be
cause you regard me as representing
and embodying the aggressive move
ment for thoroughgoing Americanism
and throughgoing preparedness. Your
devotion is to the cause and to the
man only in so far as he for the time
being embodies the cause. This is
precisely tho attitude I took in my
Trinidad statement. I now hold and
shall continue to hold this a great
time of crisis in our country's history,
because it is a great crl-is in the his
tory of the world. If we are unpre
pared. If we are rplit and sundered
by rivalries of creed,' of section and
national origin; if our country's ac
tion is to be conditioned by helpless
ness without and the hyphenate with
in the career of the United States as
a great factor in the world's civiliza
tion is at an end.
"There is no use ol being for half
measures of Americanism and ' pre
paredness. Still less is it of any use
for any public man to announce him
self in vague general terms as in
favor of Americanism and prepared
ness, unless his whole course of action
in public life has made It evident,
and now makes it evident, that he
means Jit exactly what he says. Un
less, If lie is in office, or has been in
office, his career has been such as In
fullest measure to warrant the belief
t hilt lie is a man of deeds and not of
words in this matter, and unless in
every crisis, whether ho be in or out
of office, he frankly and fully takes a
position on the concrete facts which
are up fur decision and applies the
abstract statement directly to these
concrete facts.
"General professions are utterly
woitliless, unless in the first place, the
man making them is ready to imme
diately apply them to every concrete
case as it actually arises. and un
less, in the second place, when he has
the opportunity, he at once turns his
words into deeds.
"1 am fighting for these principles.
They are the principles you are or
ganizing to support, and with all my
heart 1 welcome such support, accept
ing It as given primarily to the prin
ciples and only secondarily for my.
self.
"Any man at this time of crisis who
Is not aggressively, openly and speci
fically for these principles is against
them and every patriotic man should
treat our public servants on this basis."
