ber of Commerco, nnd considerable
enthusiasm was displayed on the sub
jects brought up for, discussion and

Bollovlng In tho start mado toward

making the visit of the delegates a
p.Ieasant one.
' The building of the road betweon
hero and Brady was discussed, and
remarks made by County Truiaurfi'r
Durbln assured his hearers that tho
.completion of a good highway between.
tno two points woum bo ratuor slow
work on account of financial condi
tions. Tho cost of a good road way is
estimated at $6,000 or $7;0p0 and as
the available funds in tho entire Sec
ond commissioner district is but
$;i,300, It would require the taxes 01
at least two years to build tho road,
oven If all tho funds wore used for
that purpose. However, It wbb stated
that work would bo started immedi
ately following the August levy, and
the road placed In acme sort of travel
shape. In this connection a commit
tee was appointed to Inquire into the
possibility of submitting tb tle votor3
of tho county a propraitlon toncreaso
the road levy.

celebration was discussed and sub
mitted to a committee to be appoint
ed by the president.

encountered in the work of placing
high voltago wires In underground
conduits. Ho know of no Kebraska
town of North Platte's slsfb- where
high Tnoltage was under ground.
Street lighting was. discussed at
length, especially the cluster light sys
tem, and it developed that tho revenues
of tho city wero not sufficient to pay
for tho current necessary for that
class of lights. However, a committee
will bo appointed to seo about placing
tho necessary underground wires be
fore paving is laid, thus obviating the
tearing up of tho pavement should it
ny.er bo decided to Install cluster
ugius.
Secretary Fisher outlined the work
proposed for tho coming year and ak-
ed for the hearty co-operation of mem
bers, nnd chairmen of committees for
several purposes were named for sev
eral specific purposes.
At tho" conclusion of tho meeting n
luflch"was-served by Mrs. Fisher and
