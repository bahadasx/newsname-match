Lost.
PARIS, May 23. Fighting contin
ued with extreme violence on both
banks of the Meuse along the Verdun
front during the whole night.
Following is the text of the Wur
Office report:
"In the region of Verdun the cattle
continued with extreme violence nil
last night on both bonks of tho Itlvir
Meuse. On the left bank furious
counter attacks delivered by the
enemy against all our positions at
Hill 304 resulted in complete failure.
To the west of the hill particularly
the enemy employed In large measure
machines to throw flaming liquids.
This permitted them to penetrate one
of our tranches,, but a brilliant
counter movement on the part of our
troops compelled them Immediately to
evacuate all the positions gained.
"To the east of the hill, In spite of
nn Intense preparatory artillery fire,
the attack of the enemy was broken
by our fire, und they could not reach
our lines.
"On the right bank of the river, in
the sector of Thlaumont and Douau
mont, the battle has been continued
with ferocity. The enemy during the
night increased the number of their
attacks In massed formation, and they
suffered enormous losses. Thoy were
successful In occupying a trench
which had been taken by us to the
north of the Thlaumont farm. Every
where else we held our positions.
"Insldo of Fort Dounumont we have
continued to force back tho enemy,
and In splto of a spirited resistance
the Germans to-day hold only tho
northeast corner of the fort.
"On tho heights of the Meuse a
surprise uttack delivered by us in the
Chevalier Wood was in nil respects
successful.
"Tho night passed with relatlvo
calm on tho remainder of tho front."
At ono time Paris was greatly ex
cited over rumors that Dead Man Hill
had been captured, but was reassured
by the orllclul reports.
BERLIN (via wireless), May 23.
Tho report Issued to-day at Army
Headquarters says:
"In the Meuse district fighting was
especially lively because of the
enemy's attempts to counter attack.
On tho west bank of the river tho
Germans took a French blockhouse
south of C'umard Forest. Attacks cast
of Hill 304 and on tho south slopo of
Dead Man Hill were repulsed.
"Eust of the Mil u so violent Infantry
engagements occurred on tho front
south of Thlaumont Farm as far as
Calllette Forest. Tho French after a
strong flro entered tho first Gorman
position, nut were repulsed on tho
flunks of the sector by German coun
ter attacks.
"South of the village and south of
the ruins or J'ort I'ouaumont un en
gagement is In progress but has not
l'cn finished. Fort Douaumont re
inulns firmly In Germun hands.
This dotpatch may bavo been
filed for transmission to Berlin
Iwforo tho French had entered the
fort.l
"Northwest of Fort Vuux a sap
temporarily occupied by tho enemy
was reconquered by us.
"On tho Coinbres heights (south
east of Verdun), tho rtrat und second
French lints wero destroyed by our
blasting for a considerable width.
On the Me ii so heights southeast of
Verdun, near Vaux-les-Pulumcx and

under our curtain fire. Small de

Charge of Tapping Father

CENSURE FOR MAYOR.
Commissioner and Hotchkiss
Held in Si, 000 Bail Each
To Have Speedy Trial.
The Kings County Grand Jury,
after two weeks of Investigation,
handed up to Judge Mitchell May In
the County Court to-day Indictments
charging John A. Kingsbury, Com
missioner of Charities, and William
H. Hotchkiss, his counsel, with Ille
gally tapping the private telephone
wire lending to tho home of Iter.
William D. Farrell, In Brooklyn, and
Intercepting messages.
The Grand Jury handed up a pre
sentment with thn Indictment. The
presentment states that If tho Mayor
and tho Polite Commissioner approved
of thn tapping of Father Fnrrell'a
tclephono wire they deserve tho se
verest condemnation.
KlngHbury and Hotchkiss, who wore
notified last nlirht liv nintrlet Attnr.
Iney Lewis to be on hand In the Coun
ity Court to-dny, evidently anticipated
arraignment, for they were accom
panied by Martin W. Littleton, who
acted as their counsel.
Mr. Littleton, on behalf of his
clients, entered a plea of not guilty
and asked for two weeks In which to
prepare for trial. District Attorney
Lewis said n week would be long
enough, and announced his Intention
of bringing thn defendants to trial In
the first week In June. Judge May
allowed Mr. Littleton ten dnys In
which to prepare his case nnd held
the defendants In $1,000 ball each,
which was furnished.
Another city official, more prominent
than Kingsbury, escaped Indictment
by u narrow margin, according to
persons who have been active in
bringing the wire-tapping matter to
the notice of the authorities. When
the Grand Jury adjourned on Satur
day It was expected that this official
would be Indicted nt tho next session,
but tho Jurors evidently concluded
that Klngshury and his counsel were
the, men primarily responsible for
tho wire-tapping,
, In addition to the indictments the
Grand Jury handei) up a presentment
which read In part:
"This body, mindful of Its duty
to find Indictments only when all
thn evidence before It taken together
is such as would, i uuxplulned and
uncontradicted, warrant u trial Jury
In convicting a defendant, has found
Indictments.
"Thero was no Icjal evidence
Justifying us In tlndlng that the
Mayor of the city t. the Police Com
mlssloner aided or abetted In the
crime charged, nnd for that reason
no Indictments were found against
them, but if, a dots appear, they ap
proved of th conduct of those who
ware retpontiblt for the tapping of
the wlrai in question for no other
purpose than to furnish counsel in
private and personal litigation and to
gratify privata curiosity, and not for
the detaction, and the prevention of
crime, the conduct of the Mayor and
the Police Commissioner marjts the
, most severe condemnation."
Mayor Mitchel, when Informed ut

ties Commissioner and .Mr. Hotchkiss,

I "I um surry the Grand Jury has

POLICE WHO "LISTENED IN" i
ALSO CALLED TO INQUIRY
Mayor John Purroy Mitchel went before the Thompson Committee
this afternoon to tell his story about wire-tapping and "lirtening in" on
telephone wires. He was in a different frame of mind from that of last
week when he threatened that if the Committee didn't hear him right
away he would "make a statement that would tear things wide open." '
Mayor Mitchel sent Corporation Counsel Lamar Hardy last night to
ask Senator Thompson to defer the Mayor' examination for a while. TIN
request was granted. Whon be left the City Hall at 1 P. M. th Maya
sald he would make up his mind white at luncheon whether or not he
would testify to-day. When ho came hack he aaid he would testify.
Assistant District Attorney """ 1-
lorn Harmon Hlack followed the
Mayor's testimony closely and beside
him sat Alfred J. Talley, counsel for
tho Tlev. William H. Pnrrell and Dr.
Daniel C. Potter and his son, Dean

wero tupped during the recent In
vestigation of charges of Inefficiency

the Investigation.
Hoforo the Mayor went Into thn

tectives concerned In tho nrooklyn
poolroom wire-tapping cases weire not
In attendance. The Commissioner
promised to order the eight police
men to report beforo tho committee
at once.
"It begins to look to me ns It this
police wire. tapping at will Is a pretty
Important matter," said Counsel
Prank Moss. "I don't say that the
cops we brought hero this morning
are dodging; they're simply slipping
away from us. Hut we'll get thorn
here If wo have to stay all night.
They've got to get thoso policemen
here. They may make fools of them
selves, but they can't make fools of
us."
THE MAYOR STARTS HIS TESTI
MONY. Senator Thompson administered the
oath to tho Mayor.
"Well, gentlemen," Mayor Mitchel

precedented misrepresentation lasting
several years during which I have re
mained silent, I shall reveal to you
tho fucts concerning this matter of

of the City of Nyw York it Is necessary
