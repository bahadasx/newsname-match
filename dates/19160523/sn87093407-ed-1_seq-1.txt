GIRL WRITER TELLS OF "PRETTY BOY' ON TRIAL
Dry Law Results Prove
Greatest Blessing That
Has Befallen Second-Av.
Merchants in Decade.
When the people of Washington shook the tree of pro
hibition, some of the biggest plums fell into the baskets
of the merchants in Sottle's old "high-rent" district.
The "dry" law is proving itself the greatest blessing
that has befallen Second ave storekeepers in a decade
Less than a year ago these tenants were doling out
fabulous sums each month to their landlords, and were
finding it a hard fight to keep their noses above water.
One little shop, with a 12 foot frontage on the avenue,
paid its landlord $600 a month
Today prohibition has forced rent of that shop down
to $450, but the store has lost nothing in trade as a result
of the passing of the s»l<x>n
Before the "dry v law, the landlord could demand a rental
of his own chooting. He could tell his complaining tenant
"If you don't like the rent, I can put a saloon in here
that will pay me more than you are paying now"
Avenge Rent in One Second Ave. Block Cut
From $500 to $350 a Month
Today this situation has ceased to exist, and Seattle mer
chants have a correspondingly better chance to make a profit
in their business instead of a loss
Rents fur ground floor »pace in one whole block on Sec
ond ave. have been cut since January 1 from $500 a month for
the average storeroom 20x120 feet to $350.
This is an exceptional case, but, generally speaking, rents
are considerably lower
I haia teas been no stiffening of the market and the land
lords are disposed to let space go at the reduced rental
charge," said Arthur F.. tioodwin. secretary-treasurer of the
Seattle Real Estate association.
"The Bon Marche's recent purchase of part of its «ite,"
he added, "may have a tendency to strengthen the market It
has given assurance that the trading center will remain where
it is."
A year ago Second ave. frontage was renting at about
$400 a lineal foot. Today it rents nearer $350.
"Where the saloons were clustered," said Henry Rrod
erick, president of Henry Broderick, Inc., one of the largest
rental agents in the city, "the reduction is naturally more
marked. In some cases it is as great as 50 per cent "
Residence Section Pretty Well Rented,
Secretary of Realty Association Declares
On First ave., between Madison and Pike st«., rents have
gone down about 35 per ernt since thr saloons went out The
storekeeper today can re.it a 20-foot front for about $75 a
month.
On Third and Fourth aves. the change has not been so
marked.
Speaking of the homes and apartment houses, Secretary
Goodwin, of the Real Estate association, said the town as a
whole is pretty well rented.
"Perhaps we are a little overbuilt," he said, "but all the
better class of homes and apartments are rented."
Fred W. West, president of West fc Wheeler, large rental
agents, would not admit that Second ave. rents hail slumped
materially.
"There are 2,880 feet of ground fl<>or space, counting
both sides of Second ave , from Madison to Pike st," he said,
"that rent for about $1,250,000 to $1,500,000 per year. There
has been no great drop in rents in that section."

Soft-Haired, Red-Lipped,
Delicate, William Orpet
Sits Composedly With
Father and Mother in Illi
nois Courtroom.
VVAUKEGAN, 111., May 23.—A girlish, brown-haired boy
i« on trial here, charged with murdering his sweetheart.
Weak-chinned, delicate, violet-eyed, red-lipped, he surprises
everybody by the contrast between his fragile appearance
and hi* strong composure.
Me is Will Or pet, 20, a college l>oy, whose sweetheart,
Marian I.ambert, 18, was found dead—poisoned—in Helm
woods at Lake Forest, the morning after she was known to
have kept a tryst with Orpet there.
He is not the type that would slay by violence; there's
nothing of the cave man in him.
He is not the primitive, abysmal brute that feminity
is supposed to admire.
There's none of the red-blood pose in him.
He is not the sort that rules his sweetheart with a loud
voice and tells his friends, with a knowing swagger, that
"women like to be bullied!"
Prisoner U a "Mamma's Boy" Type,
Soft-Voiced, Soft-Eyed, Soulful
His, rather, is the "mamma's type"—soft-voiced, soft-eyed,
soulful, "pretty"—a heartbreaker.
He maintains that Marian took poison after learning he
was to marry Celeste Youkers, who had supplanted her in his
affections.
You couldn't imagine Orpet STRIKING a girl; a pirtrrV'
so you'd think, would send cold shivers up his spine. A
dagger would be out of the question—he's not the dagger
sort.
Hut poison is the weapon the state alleges—and there is a
poser for the trial jury.
WOULD Orpet, to whom the gun and the sword alike
seem foreign WOULD he use the quiet, silken method to
rid himself of a sweetheart who had ceased to interest?
Orpet sjts in the dingy court between his father and his
mother—only a foot or so from the curious spectators
gathered to watch his battle for freedom.
W hen his parents leave the room he moves up to his
lawyer's table.
James H. Wilkerson is the boy's attorney.
Having Hard Time Trying to Pick
Jury With No Fixed Opinions in Case
lie and Ralph J. Dady, state's attorney, are having a
hard time picking a jury with no "fixed opinions."
Orpet, an undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin
at Madison, and Marian Lambert, his neighbor, school chum,
and later sweetheart, lived at Lake Forest, a suburb of
Chicago.
Everybody knew of their devotion, but nobody knew to
what extent it had gone, until her body, stiff and stark, was
found in the woods a little way from her home.
On February 10. when they had the last of many trysts
in Helm woods, she learned, it is believed, that another girl
—Celeste Youkers, a school teacher at De Kalb, 111.—had
won her lover's heart.
Orpet left the wood alone—it was morning.
Marian was on her way to school. She didn't follow him.
Her half-frozen body was found the next day. Her lips
were burned with cyanide.
Now the state is trying to prove that Will Orpet gave her
the poison that cost her life.
Orpet is trying to prove that she committed suicide.
Only once has Orpet lost his composure, so far.
This was when there was exhibited in court a packet
of his love letters to Marian—a packet bound with a crimson
ribbon.
Then Orpet blushed as red as the ribbon that matched
their passion
FIANCEE WILL TAKE
STAND FOR ACCUSED
MAY WOOD, 111., May 23.—Ce
leste Youker. who was engaged to
Wm. Orpet, believes him innocent
of the murder of Marian Ijanibert,
his former sweetheart, and will so
testify at the trial, she declared
today.
In her first Interview she denied
being engaged to Orpet, hut as
sorted she had faith in him.
"Whatever else he has done. 1
know he did not kilt Marian," she
said. "1 would stake my life on
that.
"lie was the kindest boy 1 ever
knew. Mo could not hear to see or
inflict pain, lie was a nice, clean,
gentlemanly fellow, a trifle bash
ful.
"I had never heard of Marian
until I rend of her death."
TO STAGE MURDER SCENE
WAUKEGAN, 111., May 23.—
Proseutor Dady, In the trial of
Wm. G. Orpet, on a charge of
murdering Marian Lambert,
propoaea to re-enact the acene
in Helms Wooda, where the
girl died, for the benefit of the
Jurors.
Boy and girl actors from
school are to take the parts of
Ocset and MarLu.
