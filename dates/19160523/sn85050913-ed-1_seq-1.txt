He enlarged upon the Idea of self
denial for today that in the future
might be reaped great reward but it
is never possible to Teach the great
est height, except through Jesus
Christ. The speaker congratulated
the students- and all those who have
made their progress possible, but
averred that this stage in their prog
ress was only the threshhold of the
-World of accomplishment.' The larg
est room in the world is room for im
provement.
He said that many of the older
ones in the audience had never re
ceived other education than at the
fireside university,- where the par
ents were both faculty and 'school
board. The world today has more
brainy teachers, more competent in
structors than ever before, which is
as it should be. We recall the priva
tions £f the early scholars of Ameri
ca and the Idiosyncrasies of the early
day instructors in these times of
larger enlightenment how Daniel
Webster chased his mother's pet
goose about the yard to get a quill
for a pen how John Quincy Adams
got from his school master a thwack
of the ruler whether, he spelled the
word right or wrong how Abraham
Lincoln got his small learning ''by
the light of the pine knot, but after
wards made his way to the presi
dent's chair.
ReV. Baber would change the ad
vice of Emerson—"Hitch your wagon
to a star"—and make it read, "Hitch
your wagon to Him who created the
stars."
The millionaire is not the richest
man in the world it is the young
man with robust health, a clear brain
and a loving heart, who Is the real
millionaire. Man has uncrowned
himself by sin, but he was made in
God's own Image and designed tc en
joy God's blessings.
A large per cent of merchants and
business men fail, but nobody plans
or likes to fail. A builder always
looks for a solid foundation, if he is
wise. He drills down, down, down,

CLASS HEM
4
The Methodist church was packed
to standing too
fn Sunday night to
hear the baccalaureate sermon by
sRer. E. R. Baber, pastor of the Unit
ed Brethren church, to the graduat
ing class of the Webster City high
school. Many were turned away, be
ing unable even to secure standing
|oom in the church.
The members "of the graduating
41ass, numbering thirty-eight, were
seated in front seats reserved for
,them, the pretty light wraps of the
girls and the dainty summery hats
making an usually attractive picture.
Miss Jennie Chrlstenson rendered
the organ prelude and after a hymn
by the ^congregation, Rev. Arthur
Metcalf "of thfe Congregational
churchi led lU' prayer. This was fol
lowed by a beautiful anthem by the
members of both boys' and. girls' glee
clubs of t|te high school. Miss Edith
Lee, director, and Miss Hester Huff
singing the solo portions.
After the scripture lesson read by
Rev. C. V. Pence, pastor of' the Chris
tian church, a -quartet composed' of
Qlen Greenwood, John Hunter Har-'
Old 4«Ml£.an.l~ Anthony ^parboe, ac
ceptably rendered—"'Now- the Day is
Over."'.
H#r Ittrtr, Baber then delivered an In
spiring address to the graduates, the
sermon being filled with wise and
sympathetic advice to the young
people. Rev, Baber has an impres
sive and dignified demeanor which
commands the respectful attention .of
an'audience. He took for his central
theme the text, "Seek ye first the
kingdom of God and his righteous
ness and all these things fhali be
added unto you." (i
i*
until he strikes a solid bed of rock
Rev. Baber's advice to the students
was to dig down until they came t6
the rock of Divine Truth, upon which
tliey should lay their foundation
stone. He admonished them to lore
their homes, hdwever humble, for
no man or woman ever became great
without a love COr a home.
Then there Is tlie love for country
for It, the speaker admonished the
students to weave every silken thread
of the flag abodt th&ir hearts and
give the best service possible. The
greatest privilege in the world is the
privilege of doing one's best.
Moses turned aside from fame and
renown to lead Ms saddened, down
trodden people out of the land of
bondage. Rather would we have our
boys work at a dollar a day, with
great principles fn their hearts than
to be millionaires.
The men and ^omen who are the
greatest power in the world today For
the kingdom of God, are the men and
women you can trust. Build the
simple faith of Jestas Christ into your
lives, and the gilt may wear away,
but the bronze Of Character will re
main build for tbe future, and when
suns are burned out and worlds are
wrecked, your characters will remain
the same.
Rev. E. G. Hay, pastor of the Eng
lish Lutheran fcfaurch, pronounced
the benediction.

Military Men Hold Successful
Exposition at Armory—Big
Cttwds.
Company 'closed a five days
spring exposition at the armory Sat
urday night, in which they made
about two hundfred dollars. The
crowds at each afternoon and even
ing were enormous, the rain of/sat
urday night atecting but slightly
the size of the audience.
The night was reserved for the
crowning of the exposition queen, or
the girl who received the most votes
for the piano whfcli was given away.
Miss Helen Perry, who secured the
piano, was crowned queen at about
10 o'clock In the evening. The de
mure little queeh,"who Is about elev
en years of age, was daintily gown
ed in white and Vas crowned by H.
M. Sparboe with hewers, having
previously chosen her attendants—
the Misses Margaret White and Lois
Leonard.
Following the crowning event.
Miss Perry with Ralph Mikel led in
the grand march wliicl preceded the
dancing.
Beside the vaudeville acts and the
crowning of the'q«een, the feature
of the evening was the violin play
ing, by Master Poole, the ten year
old nephew of Manager Poole of the
Boone orchestra wliich fufnished the
music for the exposition. The child's
playing was considered very fine and
he received, a prolonged encore.
The exposition was a success from
every standpoint. Thousands of vis
itors thronged the space between the
booths every afternoon and evening
and the benefit Was about equally di
vided between Exhibitors, Company
and the exposition, visitors. It is
probable that the company will next
spring put on a like affair, but with
more exhibits, lite small admission
fee and the amount of attractions
the management offered for the
money, was responsible for the
steady patronage.
Off to Colfax.
Mrs. E. R. Lee went to Colfax Sat
urday to take treatment for rheu
matism for a couple of weeks. Mrs.
Lee has been a sufferer from this
ailment for some time and her
friends hope she may receive the
coveted^ relief.

BETTER SERVICE
Foatoffice Department. Has Ordered
Rural Mail Route Recently
Taken From Town to
be Restored.
CITIZENS ARE MUCH PLEASED
Postmaster General Burleson Finally
Relents Under Great Pressure
of Congressmen.
Saturday morning's Washington dis.
patches state that rural route num
ber 4, Jewell, has been ordered trans
ferred to route 1, Kamrar. This
means that the people of Kamrar
and vicinity have won the fight
against the action of Postmaster
General Burleson in discontinuing
the Kamrar route and making farm
ers formerly served on that route
get their mail of carrier No. 4 out of
Jewell or No. 2 out of Blairsburg.
Last fall upon recommendation ol
the inspector of rural routes, «the
rural mail route out of Kamrar, com
prising a route of twenty-seven
milqs, was transferred to Jewell.
Patrons along the route were not
especially discommoded by the trans
fer, for they received their free mail
delivery about the same, but they
were displeased by the arrangement.
The townspeople of Kamrar roared
loud enough to be heard in Wash
ington. No particular business was
derived from the rural mail route
which left the Kamrar post office,
but the route served to keep the
name of the town on the map and
the transfer simply meant the era
sure of. Kamrar from rural mall mat
ter and the names of Jewell and
Blairsburg substituted. Naturally
the several hundreds of people felt
that a gross injustice had been done.
In view of the storm of protest
which reached Washington, the town
hats received notice that they would
again get their mail route back on
June 1st. The Iowa congressional
delegation took the matter up with
the department.

5SAYSTHE JURY
Trial Completed at 6:15 and Verdict
..Reached in Six Hours and
Thirty Minutes After­
wards.
MAXIMUM PENATY 10 YEABS
Large Number of People From South­
western Part of the County
Attend the Trial.
The trial of Oliver Bricker, charg
ed by a grand jury Indictment with
breaking and entering, was conclud
ed at 6:15 o'clock Friday night in the
district court and at 12:30 next
morning the jury reached an agree
ment, finding the accused "guilty, as
charged." The maximum penalty
for breaking and entering is ten
years in the penitentiary and it is
believed Bricker will get the maxi
mum. A large number of people
from the southwestern part of the
county were in the city attending the
trial and everybody seemed to be
anxious for Bricker's conviction.
They appear to be in great fear of
him and want the community reliev
ed of his presence. The judge has
not yet passed sentence. It is like
ly Bricker's attorneys will make aj
motion for a new trial.
Our readers are familiar with the
Bricker case. It will be remembered
that he was accused of entering a
house near Stratford, stealing a lot
of things and then setting fire to
the building. The state has another
case
against him, charging him with
arson. Tins will probably be dis
missed.

Preparations are completed for a

Coffee and ice cream will be fur

streets between 5:30 and 6:15.

TO SPEAK HERE
Socialists Making Plans to Bring
Prominent and Well Known
Man to Webster
City.
SOME TIME NEXT MONTH, of
Will Discuss the Principles of What
Most People Regard as
Utopian Dream.
It is reported that the sooiallsts of
this city and vicinity expect to se
cure Eugene V. Debs" for a lecture
here some time during, June. Mr.
Debs is one of the most eminent so
cialists in America and is an author
ity upon that subject. He is a man
of national reputation and promi
nence, having been the candidate of
the socialist party for the presidency
three times and has declined to be
the candidate this year.
Besides being a socialist, Mr. Debs
Is an educated, Christian gentleman,
a combination Mr. Peter W/ Collins
said was impossible in his recent
lccture on the "Menace of Socialism"
in Webster City. Ii^ fact, Mr. Col
lins went so far as to say that one
who declared himself to be a Chris
tian socialist blasphemed the name
of Christ, yet the number of Chris
tian socialists in this country Is ex
ceedingly large, while the number of
atheistic socialists is very small. It
all depends upon the viewpoint and
who shall define a socialist. The
mispresentation of the socialist prop
aganda as set forth by Mr. Collins,
the socialists say, inspired the move
to get Mr. Debs here for a lecture,
the members of that party desiring
to have the doctrines of the socialists
set before the public by one who
speaks with authority upon that sub
ject.
Those who take no interest in
what they regard as the. Impossible
Utopian dream of socialism will no
doubt be pleased to hear Mr. Debs.

Capt. A. M. Martin of Company
Receives Recommendation From
Washington.
A. M. Martin, a member of Com
pany C, has received a recommenda
tion as a member of the staff of Col
Wm. P. Chantland, formerly of the
Fifty-sixth Iowa regiment, who is
now in Washington, D. C., engaged
in picking up officers for his staff,
Col. Chantland will officer a regiment
volunteers in case of continued
trouble with Mexico or any other na
tion and officers from different sec
tions will be included upon his staff.
Such a regiment would contain from
,350 to 1,400 volunteers, who, upon
notification, would assemble at some
given place for drill before leaving
fo» the trouble center.
Capt. Martin was exceedingly re
luctant this morning to admit that
he had been successful in receiving
the recommendation which, it is un
derstood, Is almost equivalent to the
appointment, and would give no fur
ther information upon the subject.
E. H. Martin closed a deal Fri
day, buying of W. J. Zitterell the
two residence lots on west Division
street which are located just east of
the John A. Clifton residence proper
ty. On these lots he will this sum
mer erect two two-story modern
frame bungalows, costing in the
neighborhood of $2,500 each. These
homes will be up to date in every
respect and will be for rent.
W. J. Hubaclier and Dr. A. F.

HON TO VOTERS
Crooked Creek Railroad Company to
Ask Aid for the Construction
of a Depot in Webster
City.
TO COST $6,000 TO $8,000
Will Require a Tax of From Six to
Eight Mills on Property in
the City.
The Crooked Creek Railroad com
pany wants Webster City to build a
new depot here for the company to
cost from $6,000 to $8,000 and the
company^agrees to electrify the line
and fix it up In fine shape. It was
at first proposed to raise the sum by
subscription, but that method would
throw the burden upon a few liber
ally disposed men, while the propos
ed improvements will benefit the en
tire town. A fine depot can be erect
ed for the sum asked and the elec
trification of the road will be very
beneficial to the town.. Possibly if
the Crooked Creek gets a good depot
it will have the effect of Inducing
the Chicago & Northwestern and the
Illinois Central companies to build
stations here that will be a credit to
the town. The steam roada cannot
ask for a tax without giving stock
for every dollar so received and as
the stock of the roads is way above
par there is no likelihood ot them
asking for aid in the construction of
such improvements.
The Freeman-Tribune beliavee the
voters will favor a reasonable tax,
with the. assurance of whatever is
given the company will-be used for.
the pufpo8e For',tyh!eh'it*fcr®lyen. As
surances must also tie given that tfitl
company will electrify the line and
make other necessary improvements
to put the road in first-class condi
tion.
A one mill tax ^n Webster City
will yield approximately $1,000.
The levy is now about 90 mill* and
if a six mills tax carries it will add
little less than seven per cent to
the tax already paid, In other words,
the man who now pays a tax of $9
will pay an additional tax of 60
cents. If he now pay* $90, his ad
ditional tax will be $6. It will he up
to the voter, to determine for him
self whether or not the improvements
promised are worth the price to him.
