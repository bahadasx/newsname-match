however, happened n tne transfer of
the Tonopah office from the previous

find some discrepancies such as a

the office checked up to the last cent.
"One of the most gratifying facts
about the local office is the growth

persons here realize that Tonopah out
ranks all other offices in Nevada in
the amount of money orders or the
