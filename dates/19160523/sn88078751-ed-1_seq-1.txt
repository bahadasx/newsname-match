Washington, May 22. Both Presi
dent Wilson and Secretary of State
Lansing have been informed confiden
tially from sources close to tho en
tente capitals that peaco proposals
row are out of the question. The time
la not. rlpo, it is explained, and tue
time will not be ripe "until Germany's
military dominance has been com
pletely broken."
Realizing .that this position assum
ed by tho allies might tend to unfavor
ably influence public opinion In neu
tral countries, the chancellories id
London, Paris and Petrograd have
discouraged all talk of peace pro
posals. The attitude of the entente,
however, has been explained to the
world by lien "Vivian! of the French
cabinet, who, with the full sanction
of all tho entente governments, made
a statement in Petrograd in which he
said that the allies stand solid for a
"fight to a finish."
Diplomatic circles here fully realize

French embassy In Petrograd. It is
In fact the first statement from an ay
thorltative source setting forth the en
tente reply to Germany's proposal to
bring about the end of the struggle.
Monsieur Vlvianl's statement has
added importance here from tho fact
that It exactly coincides with the in
formation which Is understood to
have been communicated bofa to
President Wilson and Secretary Lan
sing. It explains why Secretary Lan
sing Is understood to believe that any
proposal for mediation now would
simply vitiate the position which the
United States may logically hold
when tho time to discuss peace final
ly does arrive.
Tho entente allies have translated
Germany's peace offer Into meaning
that tho Imperial government is tak

Cincinnati, May zz. Acting as

New York, May 22. Tho attitude
of Dr. Arthur Warren Walte amazes
experts In criminology. The dentist,
who was called to trial today for the
murder by poison of his father-in-law,
John. E. Peck, seems overjoyed with
;the ordeal awaiting him.
Instead of co-operating with his
lawyer, Walter R. Deuol, Waite has
hampered and opposed him at every
turn. Taking tho latitudo allowable
to counsel, Deuol has painted Walt&'s
case aa white as possible, donying and

claims that they are dally growing
stronger In hoth armament and men.
They claim that their campaign will
slowly but surely break Germany's
power by mpans of their additional re
sources, backed by the control of the
seas.
Information has been received
showing that the failure of this sum
mer's crop in Germany would spell
unprecedented disaster. Heroic ef
forts are being made in Germany to
deal with the food problem which
would be involved in this contin
gency, but so far no solution Is In
sight. The German officials are now
devoting their time exclusively to off
setting tho effects of the British
blockade.
MEXICAN RAIDERS
REPORTED IN TEXAS
General Funston Rushes Troop
o! Cavalry to the Scene.
El Paso, Tex., May 22. Mexican
raiders, who visited the Pool ranch
near Presidio, in the "Big Bend"
country of west Texas, were reported
south of Terlingua quicksilver mines.
The people in the vicinity of Terlin
gua are much disturbed by the re
ported presence of the raiders. The
Terlingua mines, which are south of
Marfa and north of Presidio, were
closed two weeks ago, when Glenn
Springs was raided and all families
were brought out, but numerous
tanchers are still at their homes in
the district and fear Is felt for sonw
of these.
A small guard of United States sol
diers Is stationed at Terlingua and
I here Is another small guard at Pre
sidio. A troop of the Sixth United
States cavalry is now being rushed to
the scene of the reported band" of
raiders, having detrained at Marfa
for the march southwest.
Because of inability to get the mil
itia in shape hurriedly for border duty
General Funston has asked thut all
coast fortifications on the Atlantic
and Pacific bo stripped of all men
who can be spared, that they may bo

district. This information was re

Bell, commanding the border patrol
