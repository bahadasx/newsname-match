TJnable to Hold Gains.
The battle around Hill 304 was especiallv
severe. In attacking French positions
on the west side of the hill the
Germans used liquid gas. the official
statement says, and penetrated one of
the French trenches, but were dislodged
at once. On the east side of the hill the
Germans attacked after intense artillery
preparation, but were not permitted
to reach the French lines.
The principal fighting east of the
Meuse was in the sector between Thiaumont
and Douaumont. The Germans
attacked in mass formation and are
said to have suffered enormous losses.
They succeeded in reoccupying one of
the trenches north of Thiaumont farm,
which had been captured by the French.
Official French Report.
The text of the statement follows:
*ln the region of Verdun the battle continued
with extreme violence all last
night on boih banks of the River Meuse.
On the left bank of the stream furious
against all our positions at Hill 304 resulted
in complete failure. West of the
hill the enemy employed in large measure
machines to throw flaming liquids. This
permitted them to penetrate one of our
trenches, but a brilliant counter movement
on the part of our troops compelled
them immediately to evacuate all the positions
gained.
"East of the hill, tn spite of an intense
preparatory artillery fire, the attack of
the enemy was broken by our fire and
they could not reach our lines.
Germans Recapture Trench.
'On the right bank of the river in the
sector of Thiaumont and Douaumont
the battle has been continued with ferocity.
The enemy during the night inct
fused the number of their atacks in
massed formation and they suffered
enormous losses. They were successful.
however, in occupying a trench
which had been taken by us to the
north of the Thiaumont farm. Everywhere
else we held our positions.
"Inside of Fort Douaumont we have
continued to force back the enemy and
in spite of a spirited resistance the
Germans today hold only the northeast
corner of the fort.
"On the heights of the Meuse a surprise
attack delivered by us in the
Chevalier wood was in all respects successful.
The night passed in relative
caim on me remainder or rne iront. '
France Elated by Victory.
Recapture by the French, after three
months, of the greater part of Fort
Douaumont, which was taken by the
Germans at the outset of their Verdun
drive. Is received with great elation by
the press and the public, the more 60
on account of the effect it is expected
to have on neutral opinion. Gen. Nivelle,
the French commander at Verdun,
took advantage of the fact that
the Germans recently have been concentrating
all their attention on Dead
Man hill, on the other side of the
river, and assembled a large amount of
artillery for the attack on the Douau- ,
mont sector.
On Sunday Gen. Nivelle began a
heavy artillery attack on Fort Douaumont
and adjacent positions. The hour
fixed for the infantry assault was 4:30
p.m. yesterday. When the moment came
French infantry, which had been carefully
selected and trained, began the
advance, singing the "Marseillaise."
Counter, Attack Repulsed.
The German resistance at some points
was stubborn. On the Froide Terre
road and at Douaumont the French had
to force back the German infantry
inch by inch at the point of the bayonet
The heading French contingents
reached Fort Douaumont at 5 o'clock.
They killed the Germans who resisted,
and sent to the rear a large number of
prisoners.
As soon as they recovered from their
surprise the Germans launched a number
of fierce counter attacks, but all
failed .and by 10 p.m. preparations had
been completed to deal with the serious
efforts the Germans are expected to
make to recapture the lost positions.
The French success is considered by
military critics here to have shaken the
whole German line at Verdun. Douaumont
fort was the most important point
captured by the Germans, and the
French gain there is regarded as having
nullified the most significant
achievement^of the Germans in the
great battle of three months.

Before Senate Committee.

f
y National Association Eepresenta[
tives Show How Efficiency Would
rl Be Increased by Proposed System.
d
e A strong plea for the adop2
tion of a retirement system and
-hi .. r? ?:,;i
Mirtigiu pension pian iui nm
- employes of the government was
e made before the Senate commitS
- tee on civil service and retrench1
ment of the Senate today by representatives
of the National Association
of Civil Service Employes
and the joint retirement committee
of the District.
The speakers insisted that the establishment
of a contributory plan, by which
part of the salaries of the employes would
be withheld from them to establish a pension
system, would be a very great injustice.
The high cost of living and the
\ comparatively low pay given the civil
service employes were emphasized.
Association Representatives Heard.
James W. McConnell of the joint civil
service retirement committee was the
first speaker, and Andrew W. McKee,
president of the National Association of
] Civil Service Employes, followed him.
Eater in the day L>r. C. Eder Reed. Jasper
- D. Evans, Robert H. Alcorn, chairman of
the joint civil service retirement com1
mittee, and Dr. Llewellyn Jordan, secretary
of the United States Civil Service .
- Retirement Association, were heard.
c Senator Pomerene, chairman of the j
* Senate committee, strongly favors the j Z
establishment of a contributory plan, j
- as does senator smoot 01 nan, anoiner i
member of the committee, and they j I
questioned the witnesses closely. Sen- I |
ator Smoot on one occasion admitted ;
J that if he had the appointing of all ,
? the civil employes of the government, j
and could make the appointments without
reference to politics and for business
reasons alone, the government
d could be run for hundreds of millions
e of dollars less than under the present
j system, in which politics has so much
to do with appointments and promoB
tions.
d "If I could do that, then I would not
e think of urging the adoption of a con,
tributory plan," said Senator Smoot.
"I am glad to hear you say that the
government is not run on sound busie
ness principles today." commented Mr.
McKee, who was on the stand at the
time. "You are in a position to do so,
fc but I am not." t
I
Cannot Afford Contributory Plan. 1
Mr. McConnel! told the committee I
s that the contributory plan is actively 1
e opposed by a great majority of the ?
r civil service employes. a
i "They feel that they cannot afford 1
. the necessary deductions in pay," he c
said. "It is the wrong principle to j
' take from the growing generation to
!. provide for the old age support of the t
1 present generation," he added, referring
to the fact that for a number of
- years the older employes of the governi
ment, under the contributory plan.
t must be given support without having *
- paid ih an appreciable amount to the t
n pension funf}.
i "We deny that the masses of em
Dloyes of the government can liun-hase f'
- arv annuity by the contributory plan s
Mfuhout denying: to their children many t
- of the advantages which they should
- have." said Mr. McConnell. "The conf
tributory plan carries with it an arbi- ^
trary and fixed age of retirement. This <3
- age must necessarily be too high for v
- some and too low for others. It is
wrong and vicious in its social aspects I
to retire men from industry still able s
and willing to work. It is just as bad, t
- perhaps worse, to retain in the service f
j those who have failed before the age f
of retirement." ?
d
?' Cannot Be Made Self-Supporting. i
Mr. McConnell insisted that no con- \
I tributory system can be made self-sup- i
r porting. He pointed to the initial cost c
II of retiring the present superannuated J
employes, to the cost of retiring those A
t u'hft ran nut nartiallv '
part of the retirement fund, to the cost
ot continuing annuities after all accumulations
have been exhausted, the
cost of administration, the effect on 3
wages or salaries of a contributory a
system, an increase inevitably following
the adoption of such a system, and
these increases would exceed the sum c
of the contributions. i
Mr. McConnell told the committee j,
that in the long run the government
would save money by adopting the a
straight pension plan instead of the r
r contributory system. f
Mr. McKee urged that Congress take $
action at the present session looking
to the establishment of a retirement f]
- and pension system for the civil etn- .
ployes of the government. He insisted ^
that no retirement system in any gov- j
ernment existed today on the contrib- (j
utory plan, and urged that the govern- ..
merit should do its part in providing |
for a retirement and pension system
for its aged employes.
Senator Pomerene and Senator Srnoot
pointed out that under the contribu- ,,
. tory system proposed in the bill which f
has been introduced by Senator Poma
erene the government would have to *
1 | contribute some $41,000,000 in the first j '
B iweniy ytrstrs ui n? wyci ana mai |
then it would become self-supporting. ^
3 Thinks1 $41,000,000 Small Amount. J
Mr. McKee said that $41,000,000 over a
1 a period of twenty years did not ap- J
pear to be a very large contribution
8 in view of the benefits the government
1 would derive from getting young 1
- blood in place of old in the departf
ments.
Mr. McKee cited the. success of the 1
straight pension systems adopted by o
the Pennsylvania railroad and the In- t
" ternational Harvester Company.
The large number of resignations by ^
government employes in recent years, t
' Mr. McKee said, indicated clearly that e
the government was not doing its full i
? share of justice to these employes. s
They resigned, he said, to take better j
" jobs outside the government. He told
J the committee that several hundred
1 thousand had resigned from 1908 to
- 1915.
"That is largely due to politics." said
Senator Smoot, "and I can tell you one i
thing, if we republicans win this com- *
ing election there are going to be a
lot more such resignations." c
. Senator Blair Lee of Maryland, a
1 member of the committee, said he did ]
- not incline to the contributory plan, ?
- since it appeared not to have worked i
well in the past elsewhere. 1

i
Zoung Electrician Is Twice Injured
in Unaccountable Way at
Franciscan Monastery. J
Local detectives are baffled in their i
ittempt to solve what is claimed to be 1
wo mysterious happenings to James '
\ Robertson, a young electrician .of i
827 Jackson street northeast, at the <
Franciscan monastery at Brookland, 1
C., recently. On the first occasion j?
dr. Robertson nearly lost his eyesight, [ <
nd on the other occasion his head was j .
>adly injured, and he suffered a con- I
ussion of the brain. For the first time i
n two weeks Mr. Robertson was yeserday

Blinded by Flash. i
i
Karly in February Mr. Robertson, 1
vho has been employed at the monas- *
ery as an electrician for about a year,
vas doing some special work on
lectric. wires in the place. He hung
t sign on the switchboard to the effect
hat he was working on the wires, and
hat the switch must not be moved.
Yhile he was so engaged he was sudlenly
blinded by an electric flash. It
cms later discovered, according to the
>once, that some one had moved the ! <
witch. Mr. Robertson was taken to *
he hospital where he remained for
our weeks, during which time it was
eared he would lose his eyesight. The
ight of his left eye gradually has beome
better, while that of his right eye
s still somewhat impaired.
Two weeks ago. after Mr. Robertson
lad returned to his duties, he was sur- ,
. : 1
risen one murum^ up^n <.-u w>
iffico at the monastery to find a "Black 1
iand" note on his desk notifying him j i
o "look out for yourself." The note'
ras on a large sheet of paper and aj
black hand" was drawn on it. ! ?
Felled by Iron Pipe. j j
Several days after finding the note?*
-Ir. Robertson upon entering his office t
.bout 7:30 o'clock in the morning was '
truck upon the head and felled tb the '*
oncrete floor. He bled profusely and 1
t was nearly four hours later before \
ie regained consciousness. He man- ^
.ged to call assistance and was re- 1
noved to a hospital, where he remained e
or more than a week in a serious con- j
lition. t
An investigation, according to the r
letectives, iisclosed that a heavy iron >
>ipe had been placed over the door of
Ir. Robertson's office, which was atached
by a string so that when the
ioor was opened it would cause the
?ipe to fall upon the person entering 5
he door. .
InspectorjCSrant, chief of detectives,
iras notified of the matter. The s
Black Hand" note was turned over to 1

PLAN TO RUSH THE BILL
CALLED POLITICAL TRICK
House Republicans Denounce Move
to Pass Naval Measure
Next Week.
The second of the administration preparedness
measures, the naval appropriation
bill, will pass the House not
later than a week from next Saturday
night, Majority Leader Kitchin asserted
today, outlining the program for
the bill to the House. Longer day sessions
and three hours every night next
week will be devoted to its consideration.
he said.
Uanrnconfotii-o "Vfonr. minn.iM- J
er, attacked the plan as a political
trick to force measures through hurriedly
on the eve of the republican national
convention. "This is not generous,
fair or decent," he said.
The proposal to rush the naval appropriation
bill through oefore the
conveniion caused excitement in the
House. Mr. Kitchen announce that
the majority proposed to bring in a
rule to take up the bill Monday, if
possible, and pass it by Friday, or take
it up Tuesday at tl^e latest and pass it
bv Saturday.
To Insist Upon Quorum.
Representative Butler of Pennsylvania,
ranking republican on the naval
committee, protested, saying it was
the understanding of many republicans
that the bill was not to be considered
until after the conventions, and they
had made plans accordingly.
He said that if the democratic majority
carried out the plan he would
insist on the maintenance of a quorum
all the time.
Majority Leader Kitchin insisted that
all the members know the points fn j
controversy in the naval bill, that they
had been debated in Congress for
years and there was no need for prolonged
discussion.

Arsenic Poisoning on
Millionaire Peck.
PRISONER IS NERVOUS
AT TRIAL IN NEW YORK
Strain Is Apparent When Witnesses
Describe Death of Accused Den
tist's Father-in-Law.
NEW YORK, May 23.?The state con:inued
to pile up medical testimony today
as the foundation of its case
igainst Dr. Arthur Warren Waite,
charged with murdering his father-inlaw,
John E. Peck of Grand Rapids,
Mich. Mr. Peck was reputed to be a
millionaire, and the theory of the prosecution
was that the defendant committed
murder so that he might fall heir
:o the Peck fortune.
Dr. Albertus A. Moore, the physioian
ivho attended Mr. Peck before his death
it the Waites' apartment in New York
bad not finished his testimony under
cross-examination when the first session
of the trial adjourned yesterday.
Other medical witnesses summoned
by the prosecution today were Dr. Percy

family physician; Dr. Otto \j. Schultze,
county medical examiner, who was sent
to Grand Rapids to investigate the
case, and Dr. Victor Vaughn, pathologist
of the University of Michigan.
Mrs. Dorothy Van Palmenberg, former
intimate friend of Mrs. Margaret
Horton, with whom Waite shared a
"studio" apartment, arrived shortly
before court convened. It was expected
she would be a witness for the
state.
Mrs. Clara Louise Peck Waite, wife
of the prisoner, was not in court when
the hearing was resumed; but it was
said she probably would be called soon
to testify against her husband.
Prisoner's Helatives in Court.
Percy Peck, son of John E. Peck; his
wife and Miss Catherine Peck, the
aged aunt from whom Waite is alleged
lo have obtained more than $40,000 for
purposes of "investment," were in
court today, as were Warren Waite
and Frank Waite, respectively father
and brother of the prisoner.
Dr. Vaughn, who made an analysis
of the organs of Mr. Peck after the
autopsy was ordered at Grand Rapids,
was the first witness called today. He
described in minute detail the effects
of the arsenical poisoning on Waite's
victim.
Dr. Waite sat with bowed head and
bis gaze directed at the floor while Dr.
Vaughn was testifying. His paleness
betrayed his nervous tension when
glass jars containing the organs of i
John E. Peck's body were produced.
Dr. Vaughn swore he found two and a
half grains of arsenic in Mr. Peck's
stomach and amounts of it too small
to weigh in other organs. He described
the effect of the poison upon the body.
Dr. Otto H. Schultze, medical examiner
for the district attorney of N'ew
i'ork, next testified concerning his visit
to Grand Rapids to investigate Peck's
ieath.
No Arsenic in Embalming Fluid.
Dr. Stanley R. Benedict, professor of
;hemistry at the Cornell Medical School,
who was next called, corroborated the
testimony of Dr. Vaughn as to the presence
of arsenic in the body. Dr. Beneiict
added that in examining a part
>f the brain of the dead man he found
?r> iinmictaL-uhld tracp of nhlorofnrm
i^ater he examined the embalming fluid
jsed. but found no trace of chloroform
>r arsenic. Waite, according to the dis:rict
attorney, paid $9,000 to the Peck
mdertaker to swear that the embalmng
fluid contained arsenic.
Reputed Admissions of Waite.
Aside from the address of the district
attorney, in which he recited
iVaite's life history and gave a compete,
resume of the circumstances
eading up to the crime to which
,Vaite already has confessed, the outitanding
feature of the trial yesterlay
afternoon was the testimony of
Jr. Moore. Waite, the witness declared,
admitted to him he had purchased
arsenic for his seventy-twoear-old
father-in-law "because the
Id gentleman didn't want to live."
3reviously, when suspicion first was
lirected to Waite, Dr. Moore said the
Lccused dentist had telephoned to
?im and asked him if he (Dr. Moore)
hought "they could hold him (Waite)
or the death of Mr. Peck because a
jurse had not been engaged to attend
he aged victim."
"Waite asked me." said Dr. Moore,
if arsenic administered before death
vould show in an autopsy, as disinguished
from the jame poison when
ised in embalming fluid."
The witness said he replied that the
>oison would be discernible in the
rain if administered before death.
In his opening address District Atorney
Swann declared that Waite
tastened his victim's last moments by
ippiying u? ni? iiusirus a nanoKerhief
soaked with chloroform.
Upon cross-examination Dr. Moore
iras questioned regarding the mental
ondition of the defendant after he
iad taken drugs on the night after
Ir. Peck died.

.A
WILDLY CHEERED ,
BY COW CROWD
Remarkable Demonstration I
for Col. Roosevelt, a Witness
for Riggs Officials.
PRAISES C. C. GLOVER
AS CITIZEN AND MAN
Also Has Good Word for Banker's
Associates?Prosecution
Raises Objections.
One of the most remarkable
demonstrations that ever occurred
in and about a court of justice
took place this morning in Criminal
Court No. i of the District of
Columbia, when Theodore Roosevelt.
former President of the
United States, testified on the
witness stand, in the highest
terms, to the character and integrity
of Charles C. Glover,
president of the Riggs National
Bank, charged with perjury in
swearing that the bank did not
deal in stocks and bonds.
Col. Roosevelt testified, although in not
such sweeping terms, to the high standing
in the community of Henry Flather
and William Flather, present and former
officials of the bank, similarly charged,
and when he left the courtroom he was
the recipient of a farewell exhibition of
admiration, during which the officials of
the court were powerless to maintain
order, even members of the jury rising in
their seats to shake the hand of the
former President.
Hard to Restore Order.
It was some minutes after he left the
room, in fact, before order could be restored,
because of the cheers for CoL
Roosevelt which came sweeping in
through the windows from the crowds in
the street. When CoL Roosevelt entered
the courtroom, before the arrival of Justice
Siddons, pandemonium seemed to
break loose from the packed and jammed
humanity awaiting him, and the room
which is often so silent that the ticking
of the clock can be heard was the scene
of handclapping, cheers, waving hats, handkerchiefs
and umbrellas, to welcome
the distinguished witness.
| The jurors participated in the cheerI
ing and handclapping as the colonel
came in with Mr. Glover, Nicholas
Longworth, Mrs. Longworth, Col.
Roosevelt's daughter, and was followed
in by other distinguished citiMene;-'mC
hand to testify to the character of Mr.
Glover and the Messrs. Flather. Senator
Oscar I nderwood, who followed
Mr. Roosevelt on the stand; Senator
Newlands, Henry White, former ambassador
to France; Rudolph KaufTmann.
Gen. John M. Wilson, Charles D.
Walcott and many others took seats
around the colonel and Mr. Glover and
participated in a reception to the former
President which included even men .
who had coine from Baltimore to catch sr
a gl;mpse of him and shake his hand.
Objections Are Registered.
These demonstrations, however, gave
place when court was convened to a
rather more orderly presentation of evidence,
several times objected to by Mr.
Laskey, the district attorney, when he
thought Col. Roosevelt might possibly
be transgressing the rules, and Justice
Siddons was obliged several times to
participate in the arguments of John
B. Stanchfield of counsel for the defense.
who examined Mr. Roosevelt,
and the district attorney as to just
what the colonel could say and how he
should say it.
Mr. Laskey, however, did not crossexamine
Col. Roosevelt when Mr.
Stanchfield said "Take the witness."
Mr. Stanchfield wasted very little
time on such questions as "Where
were you born?" "How old are you?*
etc., and Col. Roosevelt gave his residence
as "Oyster Bay, Long Island.
N. Y.f" and his occupation as "a writer"
with vim. He said;
"I first became acquainted with Mr- .
Glover in the year 1889. I think it was,
when I came here as civil service commissioner.
At that time, although I
am not sure, I think the Riggs was not
a national bank. I knew Frank Riggs
very well, and did not know Mr. Glover
so well then. My close intimacy with
him began five or six years later, and
I have now known Mr. Glover intimately
for twenty years. My acquaint
ance has continued on to the present
time. This acquaintance was very
close while I was assistant secretary
of the navy. Vice President and President
of the United States.
Glover Was Against Him. *
"My acquaintance has been intimate
with Mr. Glover socially, and has been
such as to give me a thorough knowledge
of his business integrity and
standing. Mr. Glover was often a
guest at our house, also while I was at
the White House. My children conctantly
visited at his house, including
his country house. I knew him especially
well in philanthropic, work, but I
never had much political talk with him.
I do not know what his political relations
were in 1912. I know, however,
that he was either for Mr. Wilson or
Mr. Taft. At any rate I know he was
against me." $
The audience laughed again and
again at this sally, and the criers
called "Order in the courtroom," and
Justice Siddohs was obliged to remark:
"There will be order. Remember thlf
is a uum t.
Kept Accounts in Glover Bank.
Col. Roosevelt continued the recital ?
of his relations with and knowledge of
Mr. Glover, most of the quoted sen- j
tences given being in response to ques- I
lions by Mr. Stanchfleld, although now I
and then the colonel saw his chance to *v
drive something home, and continued
without the need for leadership. Under
questioning he went on to say of Mr.
Slover:
"With regard to business matters, I
tept my account at his bank, and two.
>r three of my children kept their accounts
at his bank, because his financial
integrity "
Here the district attorney was on his
>et with an objection, and Justice Sidlone
ruled that "the witness can only
ihow his general knowledge of the
nan." Whereupon the colonel said:
"My general knowledge of Mr. Glover
