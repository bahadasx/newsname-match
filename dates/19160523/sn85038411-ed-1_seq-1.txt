Demolition of the old plant of Ihe

under the direction of the State au- j
thorlties and will he followed rapidly i
by removal of other structures so that j

but people passing on trains will be j

for years, as the proposition to give j
the State House an adequate setting

When the Hickok plant shall have I
disappeared and progress made on
other buildings along the railroad
frontage it is expected that the survey j
of the extension district will be i
started.
Students May Do Work
The question of the survey of the
park to get ideas of the topography,
the highways, trolley lines, irees and
other matters which must be taken
into account in making up an estimate
for the next legislature to pass upon
for expert landscape gardening was
considered at the recent meeting of
the Board of Public Grounds and
Buildings and will likely lie taken up
at the special meeting to be held bc
forr the end of the month.
The survey, as pointed out in the
Telegraph on Saturday, will be the
first step in the permanent Improve
ment of the extension district, a pro
gram which is to be started next year.
The Capitol Park Extension Commis
sion has done such excellent work that
although it has until June 1. next
year, to finish its task, practically
every building lias been secured, op
tioned or Is In negotiation, while a few
people have taken the question of
■ ■ ice into court.
One of the propositions is to have
State College students do the work of
surveying, the State to pay the actual
expenses. Another Is to have some
departmental staffs do the engineer
ing but It is possible that the board
may do the work itself.
Will lie Comprehensive
The survey will not be merely of
the extension district, but will be com
prehensive. In addition to workincr out
the Information for 'he proper treat
ment of the extension the engineers
will prepare plans for the improve
ments which Governor Brumbaugh
has in mind and which he discussed
with the City Planning Commission
and citizens. These plans, which also
have the support of State officials gen
erally, will include the widening of
Walnut street and North street to 100
feet and the treatment of the Third
street side of the park by abandoning
Ihe sidewalk on the park side °nd
establishing a new walk from Walnut
to North streets. Provision will be
