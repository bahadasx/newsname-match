The Advantage Of A Car On Fishing Trips
20.000CLUBW0MEN
INVADE NEW YORK
FOR CLUB MEETING
New York, May 23.No woman
ever was permitted to more than step
in, peek around and hurry out of the
mammoth Seventh Regiment armory
in this city until 20,000 of them from
all over the United States trooped
gayly in and took possession of It
this morning for the biennial con
vention of the Federal Women's Clubs
of America. And they certainly
shooed away that black, somber
bareness that pervades bachelor, club
and business quarters where women
never go.
From today to the second day in
June the armory is given up to the
biennial, which means that the
colonel's room this morning is in the
possession of Mrs. Pennypacker, na
tional president, and that the mess
room is not nearly large enough for
the luncheon which will be served at
noon and every day, but had to have
joined with it the band room and the
library.
A pitched battle between the Far
West and the Middle West, for the
presidency of the Federated Women's
Clubs of America, was under way
even before President Mrs. Percy V.
Pennypacker of Texas whacked the
gavel that brought more or less si
lence to the ranks of club womgn
gathered.
Even at this early date the con
test has simmered down to two can
didates who would succeed Mrs. Pen
nypacker. They are Mrs. Samuel B.
Sneath of Tiffin, Ohio, now first vice
president, and Mrs. Joseph Evans
Cowles of Los Angeles, Cal.
Both Mrs. Cowles and Mrs. Sneath
have mobilized their campaign forces
with the shrewdness of a Tammany
politician, and both the floor and gal
leries of the convention at the open
ing hour were the scenes of as fren
zied electioneering, jockeying for po
sition, trading between delegations
and the like as ever characterized a
buzzfest of the grand old party or
apostles of the sign of the donkey.
This election will be one of the
most important pieces of business and
there is no subject being discussed
more earnestly than the relative
qualifications of the two women for
the position.
