>LD FOLKS DAY WAS
OBSERVED VI PROSPERITY
Largest Crowd in History of Occasion
?Gov. Manning Jiakes Address?
Dinner Served on Ground.
Old Folks day at Prosperity is geting
to be an a. nual feature occasion
long, with the Little Mountain Colsgc
reunion and Memorial Day (May
Oth) in Newberry.
Several years ago the Sunday
. ncci of Grace Lutheran church conceived
the idea of setting aside one
ay for the old people to get together
n a festive spirit and give the youngr
folks an opportunity to serve them
t :1 help to fill their cup of gladness.
inese annual gataeniigs navi
vrown with the passing years until
he church with an unusually large
seating capacity is i:o longer large
anough to hold all of the visitors.
There must have been at least a thousand
people in the church and on the
grounds last Sunday. There were
;rese t a large number of old people
whose years are pressing heavily!
upon their stooping shoulders; The
oldest man present was Mr. Jacob
Shealy, who is 97 years of age.
<The exercises consisted of old familiar
hymns, two addresses, one by
the pastor, Kev. Jt;. w. i^esne, ana one
by Gov. Manning and dinner in the
grave in front of thi church. Gov.
Manning was to have made his address
Sunday morning but failed - to
?atch his train. The program was,
'herefore, transposed. Rev. Leslie
making the morning address and Gov.
Manning the afternooa address. At
*he close of Gov. Manning's address
the meeting was dismissed after the
singing of the old hymn "Blest be the
tie that binds."
> !Rer. E. W. Leslie said in part:
Many old people think they liave- no
mission in life when they get old, that
their work is completed; but they
have the greatest work of all by
testifying to the services they have
rendered. As experience is the best
teacher their experience in life is the
best testimony that they can give. So
many people, when they g~t old think
they are in the way. There should
ever be such a feeling as they can
-ender such valuable services in advice
taken from experience. You can
serve the Lord by testifying to his
goodness and mercy of which we are
all witnesses. This testimony will
accomplish more than anything else.
Some of our younger people will say
that you do not know what you are
talking about, but if the grace of God
and nothing but the grace of God has
sustained us, we can testify ,to that.
"There are many other things that
you can testify to," said the speaker,
3: d went 011 to amplify. He made a
touching and appealing address and
closed by saying: "iThus we see that
there is just as high r< mission in old
age as in youth. May God bless yoa
and sanctify your old age in the service
that is so valuable."
Gov. Manning said that in coming
to this church on this occasion it was
a privilege and an honor. He said
lie had not prepared a set speech for
lack of time on account of having attended
the North Carolina festivities
incident to the Mecklenburg celebration.
He spoke of the tender memories
of father and mother a:'.d of the
changes that have taken place during
the life time of the old people present.
One of the changes was the manner
of home life. I;. the old days the
fpmiiy would gather at night in the
home circle and read and devote
themselves to prayer and religious
instructions but in these days the
Christian home presented a different
scene?the members of the family

stressing the importance of the Christian
home as being the great defense
and protection and bulwark of the
great American nation.
