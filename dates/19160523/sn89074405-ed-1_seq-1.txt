Paris^ May 23.—The recapture by the French, after
three months, of the greater part of Fort Douamont, which
was taken by the Germans at the outset of the Verdun
drive? was received with great elation by the press and
public, rilore so on account of the effect it is expected to
have on neutral opinion.
General Neuville, the French commander at Verdun,
took advantage of the fict that the Germans recently have
been ooncentrating all their attention on Dead Man's Hill,
on the other .side of the river, atfd assembled a large
Amount ai artijlery for ah attack oh the Douamont sector.
On Sunday, General Neuville began a heavy artillery,
attack on Fori Douamont and adjacent positions. The
hour fixed lot the infantry assault was 4:30 p. m. yester
day.
When the moment came, the French infantry, which
had been carefully selected and trained, began the advance*
singing the "Marseillaise." German resistance at some
points was stubborn. On Froide Terreroad and also at
Douamont, the French had to force back German infantry
inch by inch at the point of the bayonet. The leading
French contingents reached Fort Douamont at 5 o'clock.
They killed all the Germans who resisted, and sent to the
fear a large number of prisoners.
As soon as they recovered from their surprise, the
GertimM lmw^hed a of Counter-attacks, but
all failed and by. JO p, ltr. pretri^fiorahad be
The French Success is considered, by military
here to have shaken the whole German line at Verdun.
The Douamont fort was the most important point captured
by the Germans, and the French gain there is regarded as
having nullified the most significant achievement of the
Germans in the great battle of three months.
