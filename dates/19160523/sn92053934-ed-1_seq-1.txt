Cologne Gazette on May 15, followirg
the resignation of Clemens Delbrueck
as minister of the interior. The resig
nation of Delbrueck, ostensibly on ac
count of ill health was declared to be
due to his failure to deal satisfactorily
with the food situation. Unequal dis
tribution, due to the conflicting laws
and rival authority of the various
states of the empire, was blamed as
the principal cause of the food prob
lem. Delbrueck, who resigned on account
of ill health, has been decorated by the
kaiser with the order of the black
eagle, according to advices fron Ber

Delbrueck by the emperor from his
headquarters in the field:

you my warmest thanks for your de

have always placed at disposal of the
fatherland your splendid energy, both
in times of war and peace.
"As a token of my appreciation and
my favor I have conferred on you my
high order of the black eagle. I send
you herewith the insignia of the order
with my best wishes for your recovery
and welfare. I am your affectionate

THE ROAD TO PEACE
New British
Credit Vote
Is Asked For
London, May 23, (3:46 p. m.) In
moving the vote of credit for 300,000,
000 pounds sterling as had been fore
cast in the house of commons today,
Premier Asquith commented that this
was the 11th vote since the beginning
of the war and the second for the cur
rent financial year. The total grantei
this year, he added, was therefore 600,
000,000 pounds sterling, making a
grand total of 2,3S2,000,000 pounds
sterling.
In proposing the vote Premier As
quith laid before the house an account
in some detail of the government's re
cent financial operations. He took up
the period between April 1 and May
20, saying the actual outlay during
those 50 days was 241.000,000 pounds
sterling.
Expenditures for the army, navy
and for munitions in that time, ac
counted for 149,000,000 pounds; loans
to allies and' dominions for 74,500,000
pounds and outlay for food supplies,
railways and miscellaneous items
17.500,000 pounds.
Eliminating the payments of the
Bank of England in respect of ad
vances abroad the daily average ex
penditure had been reduced to 4,600,
000 pounds. There had been a slight
decrease in expenditures for the fight
ing forces. The total outlay was some
what larger, mainly on account of
loans to allies and dominions.
The average expenditure for the ar
my, the navy and for munitions, Mr.
Asquith continued, was just under
3,000,000 pounds daily. Speaking ol
loans to allies, he said:
"Without that financial assistance,
it is literally true that the combined
operations of the allies could not be
prosecuted with success and efficiency.
The house would not grudge an addi
tion to expenditures in order that the
while financial, naval and military
fabric, upon whose cooperative work
the success of our joint efforts de
pends, should be kept in a state of
efficiency."
The premier added that he could
hold out no hope of any appreciable
reduction in expenditures. Estimat
ing that the 300,000,000 pounds ster
ling asked would last until the first
week of August, the premier said that
the expenditure of 241.000,000 pounds
between April 1 and May 20 a daily
average of 4,820,000-was the highest
rate reached by Great Britain in any
similar period during the war.

ment designed to grant woman suf

today at the state department.
General Obregon's original orders

eral Trevino to police the territory
south of the American expedition.
The new troop movements are
already in progress through Chi
huahua, the department's advices
state.
Further delay by General Carrama
in dispatching his new note regarding
the border situation is anticipated here.
The official announcement that Colonel
Sibley's expedition had returned across
the border was expected to lead to
some alterations in the Carranza com-,
municatioru

Official reports today said more than
3,000 Texas national guardsmen have
been mustered into the federal service.
The total strength of the Texas forces

regulars.
Final figures on the number of
Texas guardsmen actually mustered
into the federal service were 3,354.
Facts in Situation.
Outstanding facts in the Mexican sit
