MAUNA LOA'S TOP
The Honolulu Star-Bulletin yes
terdav afternoon published the
following special wireless from Mie
island of Hawaii concerning the
outbreak on Mauna Loa:
Hilo, Hawaii, May 22 Mauna
Loa has broken out in eruption
again
At 11 o'clock last night, 7000
feet up the lofty mountain, a lnva
flow broke out on the Kahuku side
and is already three miles down
the slope.
The flow is cutting a path be
tween the flows of 1868 and 1887,
and making its way toward Kau,
the lava traveling in a southwest
direction,
Last night newspapers could be
read in Kau and Kona by the re
flection on the skv.
Prof. T, A. Jaggar, director of
the observatory at Kilauea, and
Prof. H. O. Wood, his assistant,
went over to Kau early today to
locate the height of the outbreak.
They will establish headquarters
at Waiohinu.
All indications point to the first
explosion higher up being a vast
jet of steam and smoke released
when the mountain side lower
down broke open. There is no
sign of activity from higher up
now. All interest centers in the
outbreak at the 7000 foot level.
Two flows are now reported, the
lava stream having forked. It is
coming at the rate of one mile an
hour and should reach the govern
ment road by dark tonight. It will
strike the road about four or five
miles on the Kona side of the Ka
huku ranch gate.

to it for eight lively innings, the
former winning by a score of 9 to 4.

pompadour silk which was i n
keeping with the general scheme
of decorations for the occasion.
The spacious Frazier residence

ed through scores o f Japanese
colored lanterns

SPALDING'S CUP
AGAIN OFFERED
A writer in the Honolulu Ad
vertiser is authority for the state
ment that Colonel Spalding, of
Kealia. will put up the fine racing
cup won by one of his horses on
the track some years ago, to be
competed for again. The paper
says:
Word comes from Colonel Spald
ing, Kealia, Kauai, that he would
be glad to offer a trophv in his
possession, known as the Pres
ident's Cup. for competition at a
meeting held under the auspices
of the Hawaii Polo & Racing As
sociation. The President's Cup
was won by Duke of Norfolk, June
11, 1896, in a mile and a half race
run at Kapiolani Park, in 2:46 2-5.
The cup was presented by Judge
Widemann when president of the
Hawaii Jockey Club. Col Spald
ing suggests that the cup be given
annually for a mile and a half race
for Hawaiiau-breds, in addition to
a purse, the cup to pass from win
ning to winner of the race only
when the previous best time be
beaten.
CjI. Spalding, than whom there
is no better lover or keener judge
of the thoroughbred in these is
lands, writes that he values the
tiophy greatly, and that he would
n't take $1000 for it. Also he ob
jects to the cup becoming "a
Jockey Club ornament." or to have
it won in a sinule race. "It rep
resents." writes the staunch old
sportsman, "the triumph of a
horse ra!sed by me, and on the old
time track the time made bv him
is not bad." He concludes, char
acteristically: "You may have
faster i tinner than the Duke in
Hawaii today, but you have no
better horse." Duke of Norfolk
j was by Kealia out of Rosita. the
pedigrees of both of which animals
' Col. Sdalding has for 20 generations.

picnic outings o n Friday after
noon last, with the usual attrac
tions in the w a y of childrens'
games, refreshments, etc., much
to the satisfaction and delight of
the youngsteis and their parents,
many of whom were in attendence.
The ladies added no little to the
interest of the occasion by a nail
driyiug contest, in which the best
record was fifteen blows of the
hammer for a ten penny nail, whir
an ordinary man would have re
quired three or four strokes at
most, so he says! As a matter ol
fact very few of the nails weie
driven home at all they c me to
grief before they got that far.
The outing was slated fot that
land of adventure and romance,
the German Forest, but tke un
certainty of the weather led to a
transfer to the church lawn. How
ever, not to be utteily disapi oi tt
ed. a goodly number of the child
ren made an automobile tour of
the Forest after the pic ic, and
came back full cf enthusiasm
about what they had seen.
