LONDON, May 2S.—The greatest
French counter-offensive since the
battle of Verdun began three ^oonths

smashing drive against the German
lines both east and west of the
Meuae.
An official statement from the Ger
man war office this afternoon admit
ting that the French aro' on the
aggressive in practically every sector
of Verdun, specifically denies the
French claim that practically all of
what remains of the shell wrecked
Fort Douaumont is in the French
hands.
"South of the ruins of Fort Douau
mont and south of the village of
Douaumont, an engagement is still
going on," said the German state
ment. "Fort Douaumont remained
firmly in our hands."
The French war office on the other
hand announced today that the French
have made further progress in the
fighting at Fort Douaumont and have
now cleared the Germans from all but
the northeastern corner of the fort.
The German war office admits the
loss of a position northwest of -Fort
Vaux to the French, but declares that
it was reconquered by the Germans.
Berlin not only claims the repulse of
all French attacks west of the Meuae,

since the beginning of the war to
$11,900,000,000.
In urging the passage of the new
credits, the prime minister declared
that without loans from England, the
allies would be unable to continue
their combined operations successful

this time to even diminish loans to
her allies or to her dominions and de
clared it would be unwise to count on
England's war expenditures falling
below $23,750,000 a day.
The expenditures for the past fifty

spectators who viewed the ring of
presidential politics today Baw nestled
within Its circumference tie unmistak

score or more republicans, most of
them Taftians in 1912, wno were at
Oyster Bay late yesterday, bore wit
ness today to the actual hurling of
the slouch hat into the said ring.
They attested to the fact also that
Colonel Roosevelt has joined the
ranks of the "smokers-out" of Justice
Hughes. The colonel's speech accept
ing the services of the newly organ
ized league of republicans worldng for
Roosevelt, was regarded by politicians
here as an unmistakable bid for the
nomination. Also there were refer
ences—not by name, although the tar
get was Hughes, unmistakably—de
claring that no man should be named
for the presidency who does not
frankly state his views on "Ameri
canism and preparedness" and "unless
in every crisis, whether he be in or
out of office, he frankly and fullr
tikes position on tha c.-ncrete facts
which are up for discussion and ap
plies the abstract statement directly
to these concrete facts."
The former president amplified this
with the declaration:
"Any man who is not aggressively,
openly and specifically for these prin
ciples (referring to Americanism and
preparedness) is against them."
"You are for me," the colonel said
in another section of his carefully
prepared speech, "because you regard
me as presenting and embodying the
aggressive movement for thorough
going Americanism and thorough
going preparedness. Your devotion Is
to the cause, and to the man only
insofar as he for the time being em
