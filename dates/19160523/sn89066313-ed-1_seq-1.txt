present al tin- banquet given at the
Crni i':ilc last night hy the Hoard of
Kiliirulion in honor of former super
iiiii'inti'iils and members of thu hoard.
Interspersed among compliments to
liolli the old and the new members of
Hie oi'lnial staff and the praises for
Columbia's schools as they are today
were many reminiscences of school
bov nranks and examples of stern
discipline in the days when the rod
was wielded by a strong hand.
K. II. Cauthoni. principal of the Co
lumbia High School, was toastmaster.
lie pronounced it one of the most re
markable assemblages ever held in
Columbia. Then he introduced .Major
K 1 Kvnns as one who had been on
I lie school board before it was or
ganized Ve had a township organization
then." said Mr. F.vans. "When a
teacher wanted money she went to the
township clerk and got it, provided
there were funds. We thought that
$:". was a tremendous salary to pay a
teacher. We had three teachers when
ive lirst organized: now we have
-ity-five."
"People Mure Liberal Then."
W. T. Anderson, who served nine
i ear" on the board, beginning in 1S73
a a member of the first board, said
the people were more liberal then
than they are now. "The progress
tiom m time until the present has
been simply wonderful," he said.
W. S I'ratt, who was elected ill
ls7: as the lirst superintendent of the
Columbia public schools, picked out
athletbs as one of the progressive
featilies of the schools today. "To be
on the team the bovs must make good
in their studies and live clean lives."
he said, "and after they get on the
team they learn the value of organi
zation and team work. I believe the
bo)s and girls are better students
than they used to be."
Colonel Kli Hodge, a member of the
board elected in 1S7!, said the prog
ress made since the time when school
was hebl in the little old .Methodist
Church on Rroadvvay was perfectly
natural when be looked around at the
men who bad helped to bring it

The Child Welfare Committee will

in Room 12 of the Y. M. C. A. Building.
This will be a business session, but
inasmuch as the committee is a volun

Signatures were still being affixed
today to the petition circulated by the
pastors of the negro churches of Co
lumbia, asking that the film, "The
Hirth of a Nation," not be shown at
the local theater at which it is an
nounced for next week.
' "Feeling among our people is in
tense," said J. 15. Coleman this morn
ing. "I have many letters from those
who live in towns where the film has
been shown, all testifying to its per
nicious influence. Judge I). P. Dyer
of the United States District Court at
St. Louis, a man whom I have known
since boyhood, wrote me that the seg
regation ordinance in St. Louis was
solely a result of the long showing of
the film iu that city. I have several
letters from other men in St. Louis
lawvers. most of them testifying to
their belief in the harinfuluess of this
picture."
Pleased at llr. i:ll wood's .Stand.
Coleman and the Itev. W. M. Sim
mons, pastor of the negro Christian
Church, expressed themselves as much
pleased at the stand taken by Dr. C.
A. Kllwood of the University against
the showing of the film.
Dr. J. W. Hudson, professor of phil
osophy. today in an interview, added
his protest to that of Doctor Kllwood
"I saw the film iu Huston," lie said,
"and 1 feel that it entirely misrepre
sents present conditions iu the South.
Neither is it historically accurate.
Nothing but harm can result to both
the negro and the southern white man
from a showing of this picture. It
was the feeling of many of the edu
cated people of Boston that the great
est injustice of the film is in a mis
representation of the feeling of the
southern man toward the negro."
Asked concerning the possibility of
withdrawing the film, H. H. Hall,
manager of the Columbia Theater,
said that he would proceed as though
nothing had been said or done and
that, iu his opinion, the matter did
not warrant discussion.
Officials -Mnj (.'el Private View.
Councilman O. D. Kellogg sug
gested to Mayor J. M. Datterluti this
afternoon that a committee from the
City Council and the mayor arrange
with the management of the Colum
bia Theater to see the photoplay, "The
Hirth of a Nation," before its presen
tation here next week and decide
whether it should be shown.
The mayor seemed agreeable to the
plan.
He said that he had not received
the petition from the negroes and
that he knew nothing about the pic
ture, but understood it was of the op
posite nature from "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" and he had never heard of any
petitions against the latter.
When Mr. Kellogg called the mayor's
attention to the fact that the 200 sign
ers of the petition represented that
many citizens, he replied that a
counter petition could probably get
."00 signers.
Hut if the picture is bad," he said,
"I'm against it, and I would be glad
to get a chance to see it and decide."

-Medical Student Find Excitement iu
Chase for Specimens.
Is there a frog famine iu the United
States? Apparently so, for the stu
dents in the School of .Medicine iu the
la.st few weeks have been forced to go
out and catch their ovvji frogs for ex
perimental purposes iu the laboratory.
For some unknown reason the frog
farms in Indiana that formerly sup
plied the sch'ool with specimens have
been unable to do so lately. One
medical student suggested that these
supply houses had gone to niauufai'
luring munitions.
Hut the medical students must have
frogs or no work can be done. And
frogs they get. One or two of them
are delegated to bring in so many
frogs liefore such and such a time.
Then the next morning before classes
begin the frogs are taken out of t lirir
superficial pond (a wooden trough) in
the laboratory and auctioned off to tha
highest bidder: during this sale ora
tory is white hot and full of terms
which onlv the medical student can
know. Only last week (). V. liaison fell

groping iu the dark for those green
"critters" that croak, go under and

lie finally reached his loom via the
alley route, all mussed up with mud
and ire. The next morning frogs went
up 10 cents a bead, a result of Hat
son's bad luck.
Hut C. A. Smith, the next delegate
sent to the frog convention, returned
with a bucket full of the green
"suckers" from the Hiiikson and
brought the price back down with a
slump.

l'aul L. Hogan. superintendent of

said this afternoon that he would take
up the matter of sanitation, to which
attention was called through the Mis
sourian by -Miss Hertha Hamilton, with
the Commercial Club and bankers of
Columbia, and if they saw fit, would
close down the factory for a month
and give i a thorough clean-up. ac
cording to their judgment of a clean
up. Mr. Hogan expressed the opinion
that .Miss Hamilton's knowledge of
shoe factory conditions was slight.
'If she can suggest any method of
keeping the men from spitting on the
floor" he said, "we will be grateful to
her. and will pay her if she can stop
it."
Further than this, .Mr. Hogaii said
that he didn't have "a damned thing"
to tell the Missourian.
"I do not care to engage in a
wrangle with a woman in your pa
per," lie told the reporter.
"We don't care what the Mis
sourian says. We don't care whether
there is a factory here or not there
are plenty of other towns that want
one."

"The statement or conditions at
the Haniilton-Hrown shoe factory in
recent issues of the .Missourian is ab
solutely true, except that the condi
tions are really worse than pictured,"
said a former student employe of the
factory to a .Missourian reporter to
day. "I worked at the factory from
last October to February, and I real
ized then that conditions were bad,
but I did not see any good in com
plaining, present workmen in the
factory tell me that conditions are the
same as when I worked there.
"I feel especially sorry for the
oung girls and women who work
there. They have no seats or benches
to use when they want to rest. They
have no wash rooms or places to
dress. Some or the women wash their
hands at a large sink. As far as I
know, no towels are furnished them
to dry their hands. In the office
there is a place to wash, but only the
clerical force uses it.
"There are no individual drinking
cups. One dipper at each sink is used
by all.
"The men chew and spit on the
floor.
"Some persona may get the impres
sion that I was let out or was not
satisfied with my own working con
ditions. This wrong impression I want
to remove. I was satisfied with re
position, for I worked in the office. I
iuit voluntarily becausc.the work in
terfered with my school duties.
"I hope that conditions will be made
more sanitary and that arrangements
will be made to give the women some
privacy."
