HAZEL DAWN
AT THE LYRIC
MAYW--25TH
Famous Players Star Celebrated
Deauty Will Appear In
"The Saleslady"
Ono of tho New York City's great
est department stores and her cele
brated lolin play Important parts In
Hazel Dawn's latest Famous Players
Paramount picture, Tho Saleslady, In
which this fnmous beauty Is appear
ing at tho Lyric Wcdnesdny nnd
Thursday. This Is tho first tlmo that
any of tho big New York department
stores has over been used nn tho
setting for a motion picture. In
this case, over threo hundred em
ployees were specially engaged to act
natural, for tho purpose of giving tho
sceno tho proper ntmosphoro.
Tho violin which Miss Dawn mado
unforgcttablo In Tho Pink Lndy,
makes Its motion plcturo debut In
this film not that it can bo heard,
of courso, but anyone who is familiar
with muslo can seo at a glance that
tho star Is actually playing her be
loved Instrument. In tho Btory, tho
violin Is Helen's only consolation
when she flnos herself forced by pov.
crty to como to New York in search
of employment. Sho lives In a
cheap boarding house and Is playing
tho violin when sho hears the sound
of a racking cough noxt door.
'Investigation shows a young girl
who l suCfcrlnir from tuberculosis.
The doctor stntes that tho patient's
only hope of recovery lies In Instant
remon! to tho country. Though It
costs her every cent sho possesses.
Helen manages to start tho girl on
tho road to recovery.
Sho obtains employment In n de
partment store but tho attentions of
tho lloor walker become so obnoxi
ous thnt she Is forced to, snub him
very flatly. In a spirit of rovengo ho
has her dlschnrgcdr but she is rein
stated when she goes to tho matron
and tells hor story.
That Is only tho beginning of tho
trials and struggles through which
Helen goes. Sho marries n wealthy
young chap who Is promptly disinher
ited by his father. Ho gets a position
as an automobile demonstrntor but
Is badly hurt and Helen is forced to
go un the stage to earn a living Sho
Is successful nnd there begins her
ncqunlntnnco with n man who plays
an Important part In her later llfo.
Frederick Tliompson, under whoso
direction Tho Saleslady, was produc
ed, has accomplished remarkable re
sults In tho handling of tho depart
ment storo and stago scenes. In sup
port of Miss Dawn, who Is unques
tionably at hor best In this plcturo,
thoro appear Irving Cummlngs, Clnr
once Handysldes, Arthur Morrison,
Dorothy Rogers, Janet Flndlay and
others who nro well known to tho
