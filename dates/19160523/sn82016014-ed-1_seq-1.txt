Looking to Colonel Roosevelt as the
one man to lead a reunited Republi
can and Progressive party in the 1916
campaign, Kansas Progressives in
their state convention this afternoon
selected delegates who would be for
Roosevelt first, last and all the time.
The real fighting spirit broke out dur
ing the keynote speech by Henry
Allen of Wichita during the morning
session and took a fresh start this
afternoon when Carr Taylor of Hutch
inson, elected permanent chairman,
told the delegates there could and
would be no compromise.
Every act and every word of the
convention was for a single purpc-
the selecting of a delegation that
would stand firm and go to the last
ditch to get Roosevelt. The delegates
wanted harmony, they declax
wanted to get together with the Re
publicans in Chicago. But the getting
together, they asserted in loud and
forceful tones, would be on the basis
of Roosevelt as the harmony candi
date. Seventh Had Its Way.
Methods of selecting delegates, the
number of delegates and minor details
of the convention were lost sight of.
The Seventh congressional delegation
went into the state convention with a
list of six delegates and six alternates,
all of whom wanted to go to the con
vention. There was a protest. But in
the end. the Big Seventh had its way.
Then the Fifth district came back with
a list of four delegates. Other dis
tricts elected two and four delegates
each. The original call gave the state
but 13 delegates 11 from the con
gressional districts and two at large.
That plan went out of style early.
At first there was a disposition to
double the size of the delegation and
reduce the voting power of the indi
vidual delegate. But the demand for
places on the delegation resulted in a
turn which will give Kansas a repre
sentation in the Progressive national
convention several times, as large as
originally planned.
Nearly 400 There.
When the convention was called to
a order in the Auditorium at 11 o'clock
t this morning, there were 392 delegates
f. in attendance. A number of addition
n al delegates arrived on noon trains and
g the afternoon attendance was in-
creased to nearly 500. The call pro

vided for 711 delegates from the 105
counties of the state.
U. S. Sartin, state chairman, opened
tr.e convention. Following the read
l ing of the call, Henry J. Alien of
i Wichita was named as temporary
i chairman. Following his keynote
j speech and the formality of selecting
I committees on resolutions, credentials
f and crders of business, the convention
took a recess until 2 o'clock this after
noon.
Taylor Permanent Chairman.
At the afternoon session Taylor was
made permanent chairman without
opposition. Following a speech in
which he pleaded for a united stand
for Roosevelt and no compromise, tho
convention took up the regular order
of business and provided for the se-
lection of four delegates at large
istfac' of two as was provided in the
I original call.
Brevity But for T. II.
In the shortest resolutions ever
i adopted by a state convention. the
j Progressives this afternoon instructed
I the Kansas delegation to the national
convention to vote for Theodore
Roosevelt for the presidential nomina
tion. No word or intimation was con
tained in the resolutions which in any
manner looked to a compromise of
candidates. It was Roosevelt or noth
ing. Bridge Over Differences.
Leaders in the party expressed con
fidence that the Republican-Progressive
differences of four and two years
ago would be bridged at Chicago and
that the two conventions would ratify
the same nominee. Almost unani
mously, however, the Progressives in
sisted that the logical man on whom
a ratification could be reached was
Colonel Roosevelt. It is with that
purpose in mind the Progressives will
go to the national convention yelling
for the former president.
One Solution Roosevelt.

LAND OF MISERY
Poverty, Famine, Disease Ram
pant in Mexico Xow,
Carranza Government Is Weak
er Than Ever Before.
Washington, May 23. Reports to
the state and war departments from
official sources show alarming eco
nomic conditions in Mexico. Poverty,
famine and disease have reduced the
country, these reports show, to an ex
tent that - convinces many officials
there is imperative need of outside
aid.
The result has been to create fur
ther discussion of the advisability of
intervention to rehabilitate Mexico as
the only permanent solution of the
problem.
re Factos Weaker.
From all information available the
Carranza government is weaker today
than it has been at any time since the
close of the Carranza-Villa revolution.
The refusal of Mexican merchant
accept Carranza's fiat currency and
the widespread strikes engendered by
refusal of railroad workmen to accept
this worthless money as wages have
precipitated an industrial revolution
that adds to the menacing situation
produced by the growth of the mili
tary revolution against Carranza.
No Afd Possible.
Under the present condition, the
United States government, officials de
clare, is powerless to give financial aid
to Carranza. It can not even guaran
tee loans from private sources since
moneyed interests apparently are un
willing to take the risk of a loan to
the de facto Mexican government un
less the United States polices Mexico
and takes charge of the customs col
lections to insure repayment of loans
and interest.
It is believed that Marion F. Letch
er. United States consul at Chihuahua
City, will have valuable information
to place before the state department
when he arrives in Washington today
or Wednesday after his conferences
with other consuls on the border.

Hopes of Presbyterian Commissioners

Atlantic City. May 23. The hopes
of 900 commissioners attending the
Presbyterian general assembly, who
had been informed by members of
the Xew York Presbytery that the
all-important question of a union
seminary and alleged departure from
the tenets of Presbyterianism would
be amicably settled today without dis
cussion or friction, vanished when the
committee on bills and overture an
nounced that it has come to no defi
nite conclusion as yet- The com

Beverly, Mass., May 23. "No Irish

an advertisement for a gardener in
serted in a local paper today by Max
well Norman, social leader and brother
of Guy Norman, candidate for the
Republican nomination for congress
from the Newport district.
It has stirred up excitement in
Hamilton, where Mr. Norman has a
summer home.

Kansas City, May 23. An all night
search by a posse of one hundred
men failed to bring about the capture
of the bearded white man who late
yesterday bound Hulda Frommer, 15
years old, to a tree near her home
at Shawnee, Kansas, and attempted
to attack her. While the authorities
continued the hunt today it was
feared the man had escaped. The
girl still was suffering from cuts and
bruises made by barbed wire with
which she was bound by her assail
ant. .
WAR TOJICTORY
Allies Must Triumph, Says

Intentions Are to Crush Ger
many, Say German Diplomats.
Washington, May 23. The state
ment of Premier Briand, of France,
to a delegation from the Russian
duma that war must continue until
the allies triumph, put a damper upon
peace discussion in the capital.
The premier's added statement
that "peace must not result from
diplomatic intrigue," was accepted as
a hint to the United States and other
neutrals that their services as peace
mediators are not desired.
In German diplomatic circles the
Briand utterance was pointed to as
justification of statements repeatedly
made that while Germany is ready to
discuss means of achieving honorable
peace, the allied governments are in
tent upon crushing the German em
pire under their heels.
AIMS GUNAT BABY
Burglar Forced Couple to Give
Up Their Jewelry
By Threat to Shoot Child in
His Crib.
Kansas City, May 23. A burglar en
tered the home of J. M. Daniels, a real
estate dealer in the fashionable Lin
wood boulevard district early today.
He pointed a revolver at the seven
months son of Mr. -and Mrs. Daniels,
who lay sleeping- in a crib.
"Give me your money and jewelry
or I'll kill the baby," the intruder
commanded. Mrs, Daniels took a S500
diamond ring from her finger and fol
lowed it quickly with a less expensive
ring and a wrist watch.
"Must I give you my wedding ring?
she asked the burglar. "Yes, and be
quick, the man responded. (
After obtaining a small amount of
cash from Mr. Daniels, the burglar
departed. "111 be around here half
an hour," he warned. "If you give
an outcry or alarm, I'll step in and kill
your baby."
HUGHES WON'T TALK
Justice Will Not Comment on Roose
velt Rumors.
Washington, May 23. A final effort
to "smoke" Justice Hughes out into
the open as to his sentiment towards
the Republican nomination for the
presidency has failed. Representa
tives of certain leading candidates en
deavored in vain to have him confirm
a widely circulateed report that he
already had decided that the Chicago
convention would nominate Colonel
Roowvelt, and that as a result he
would demand that his friends keep
his name out of the contest. When
the report was brought to the atten
tion of the secretary of the justice, he
said:
"Justice Hughes has refrained from
commenting on any political rumors.
He still has nothing to say. So far as
irresponsible suggestions are concern
ed, the justice naturally will not dis
cuss them.
Denial was also made to reports
that former Postmaster General Frank
Hitohcook has been tonrine- th south

dacy and that he succeeded in lining
up many of the delegates from that
section for the associate justice. On
behalf of Justice Hughes it was stated:
"Justice Hughes has had no com
munication whatever with Mr. Hitch

Paris, May 23. Fighting continued
with extreme violence on both banks

during the whole night. The German
counter attacks on French positions j
on Hill 304 failed completely, the j
war office announced this afternoon. :
The French made further gains with- t
in Fort Douaumont. The Germans
now hold only a small angle on the
northeastern corner of the fort.
The battle . around Hill 304 was
especially severe. In attacking French
positions on the west side of the hill
the Germans used liquid gas. the offi
cial statement says, and penetrated one
of the French trenches, but were
dislodged at once. On the east side
of the hill the Germans attacked after
intense artillery preparation, but were
not permitted to reach the French
lines. The principal fighting east of
the Meuse was in the sector between
Thiaumont and Douaumont.
The Germans attacked in mass for
mation and are said to have suffered
enormous losses. They succeeded in
reoccupying one of the trenches north
of Thiaumont farm, which had been
captured by the French.

Takes Active Hand in Mexico
Bandit Campaign.
Orders 30,000 Troops Aorth to
Suppress Outlawry.
Washington. May 23. The Carranza
government has ordered 30.000 troops
into the region south of the border
to exterminate bandits, according to
information received today at the state
department. General Obregon's origi
nal orders, issued after his conference
at El Paso with General Scott and
General Funston, assigned 10,000 men
to General Trevino to thoroughly po
lice the territory south of the Ameri
can expedition.
The new troop movements are al
ready in progress through Chihuahua,
the department's advices state. The
columns are routed north via Saltillo
for the most part, as the railway strike
has interfered with the movement of
troop trains over other lines.
Carranza Note Pelayed.
Officials here were inclined today to
anticipate a further delay by General
Carranza in dispatching his new note
regarding the border situation because
Colonel Sibley's expedition in pursuit
of the Boquillas raiders has returned
across the border. Prompt withdrawal
.of this expedition when it reached the
end of the trail probably will have a
beneficial effect on future negotia
tions with the de facto government,
officials believe. . General Carranza
can not fail to look upon the retire
ment of the troops when their im
mediate mission was concluded, as
demonstrating the purpose of the
United States government to be only
the policing of the region.
Official reports today said more
than 3.000 Texas national guardsmen
have been mustered into the federal
service. The total strength of the
Texas force was 163 officers and 2,644
enlisted men when it was called out
and additional men have enlisted for
the border patrols. Mustering of the
Arizona and New Mexico guardsmen
is being delaved. General Funston re
ports, until the skeleton companies
can be recruited to the required
standard.
Secretary Baker has not decided
what action shall be taken regarding
the 116 Texas guardsmen who de
clined to enroll in the federal service.
Judge Advocate General Crowder has
submitted an opinion to General Scott,
chief of staff, outlining the war de
partment authority to court-martial
the recalcitrants. His onl recom
mendation, however, was that If the
court-martial were ordered a majority
of the members of each court be
militia officers, not regulars.
Final figures on the number of
Texas guardsmen ' actually mustered
into federal service were 3,354, or
an increase of 547 men over the full
strength of the organization when it
was called out.

Oyster Bay, N. T., May 23. Theo
dore Roosevelt has issued what is re

his position on the issues of the forth
coming campaign.
He frankly accepted the support of
the committee of regular Republicans
organized last Sunday to promote his

on Americanism and preparedness, he
said :
"Any man at this time of crisis who
is not aggressively, openly and speci

treat our public servants on this

Waite Submitted Confession in

Papers for Publication.
' New York, May 23. New sensations
in the arch-poison plot of Dr. Arthur
Warren Waite were offered during the
progress of his trial for the murder of
millionaire John E. Peck, of Grand
Rapids, today when it was revealed
that the state has secured evidence
heretofore unrevealed, tending to
show that Waite began plotting the
death of his wife's parents immediate
ly after his marriage.
Waite, according to evidence which
will be introduced made his first pur
chase of poison on Sept. 26, 1315. This
was only about two weeks after his
marriage to Clara Peck. The poison
was purchased of the Parke-Davis Co.,
of Detroit. At about the same time
Waite communicated with Dr. Lewis
Heltman in Detroit, and sought all in
formation possible as to the effects of
different poisons.
Identify 'K. A damn."
Dr. Heltman will apper as a state's
witness.
In addition to this new line of evi
dence, a list of witnesses announced
by the state today revealed that the
mysterious "K. Adams" has been lo
cated and will testify against the fash
ionable young doctor. It was a tele
gram signed "K. Adams" received by
Percy Peck in Detroit, that resulted in
the investigation revealing Waite as j
responsible for the death of Mr. and j
Mrs. Peck. The telegram was sent i
before the elder Peck's burial, and
advised that the family insist on an j
autopsy. The real identity of the
sender of the telegram is still a mys-
tery. On the list of witnesses the J
name is merely known as "K. Adams.
Dr. Victor C. Vaughn, dean of the I
medical department of the University
of Michigan at Ann Arbor, was the
first witness called today. Dr. Vaughn
who made an analysis of the organs
of Mr. Peck after the autopsy was
ordered at Grand Rapids, described in
minute detail the effects of the arsenic
poisoning.
Dr. Waite sat with bowed head
while Dr. Vaughn was testifying. His
paleness betrayed his nervous tension
when glass jars containing the organs !
of John E. Peck's body were pro- j
duced. . j
Dr. Vaughn swore he found two i
and a half grains of arsenic in Mr. ;
Peck's stomach and amounts of it too
small to weigh in other organs. ... I
Dr. Stanley R. Benedict, professor j
of chemistry at the Cornell Medical
college, testified that in examining a!
pan oi me orain oi tne dead man he
found an unmistakable trace of chlor
oform. Later he examined the em

Henry Allen Sets Progressive
Convention on Fire Today.
DEMAND COMES FROM PEOPLE
It Is Americanism This Call
for the "Rough Rider."
Wildest Enthusiasm Displayed
in Politics in Tears.
Henry J. Allen of Wichita set Kan
sas Progressives afire with enthusiasm
for Theodore Roosevelt today in a
keynote speech before the state con
vention. The wildest enthusiasm dis
played at any political convention in
Kansas this year characterized fre
quent mention of the colonel's name.
Allen spoke for twenty minutes fol
lowing his election as temporary chair
man and the upsetting of the early
slate for the initial organization of the
convention.
Henry J. Allen of Wichita, whose key1,
note speech set the Progressives
ufire with a demand for Koosevelt
and no compromise.
An agreement had been reached
which provided for the election of
Carr Taylor of Hutchinnon as tempo
rary chairman. But Alien came to
Topeka this morning. Just as R. J.
Hopkins of Garden City arose to nomi
nate Taylor, William Allen White of
Emporia took chips in the game and
placed Allen in nomination, with the
provision that Taylor become the per
manent chairman. The motion was
adopted and Allem went to the stage
as delegates cheered.
Allen's speech to the delegates was
the sort that sets a convention wild
with enthusiasm. There w .s not a
word or syllable of compromise In
those twenty minutes. It was T. H.
or nothing. The delegates hung on
every word of it. Women waved hand
kerchiefs and clapped their hands.
Men yelled and stamped their feet and
threw their hals in the air when
Roosevolt's name was mentioned, and
it wa. the old-time spirit of the fight
ing Bull Moose.
Sees Two Factions.
"There are two factions here the
men and women without compromise,
the delegates who wouldn't take any
one but Roosevelt" and here Alltn
stopped until the delegates let off
steam. " Then there is the crowd that
is a little more for Roosevelt.
"I am willing to compromise if .they
compromise on Roosevelt. We are here
not beciuse we are interested in any
party, but because this is the greatest
hour of our lives. I am Just as much
convinced this situation demands
Americanism as in 1S12. I am just as
much convinced we have the man as
then.
"Four years ago we told the Re
publicans we were willing to meet
thm at a certain place at a certain
hour. Some time later some of ua
thought we smelied the fatted calf.
But when we struggled back we found
it was some one who had precede! us
who was the burnt offering. Now we
find they haven't had any live itjok

Now we are going to Chicago to ofler
them the greatest political feast tht
was ever offered. We hope they meet
it with tru? American spirit.
