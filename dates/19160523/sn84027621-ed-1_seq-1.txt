Brilliant Victory for French Arms is Received
With Great Elation
pE GERMAfl VERDI
Paris, May 23. The greater part
of Fort Douaumont has been recap
tured by the French. This fort was
taken by the Germans at the begin
ning of the great Verdun battle four
months ago, and the Germans at the
time heralded the feat as a great ac
complishment and predicted an early
victory over the enemy. An an
nouncement of the retaking of the
fort has been made and there is great
rejoicing by the French press and
public; It is expected that the effect
on neutral opinion will be great also.
The new victory of the French arms
is believed to have shaken the entire
German line at Verdun, and to have,
nullified the greatest of the German
achievements in this sector.'
General Neville, in command of the
French, took advantage of the enemy
attacks on Dead Man's hill, carefully
prepared his position, and his troops
advanced against the Douaumont lines
singing the Marseillaise, using the
bayonet in most effective fashion.
Following the general failure of . the
crown prince's army, the enormous
losses sustained and the prolongation
of what expected to be a drive that
would in a few days end victoriously,
the effect of the new set back on the
German people will probably be ser
ious. . . .''.'
. The French, sprung a drastic sur
prise in attacking the Germans north
east of Verdun and penetrating Fort
Douaumont. General Neville's forces
successfuly drove tfie Germans from
all but a small angle in the north
eastern corner of the fort, says to
day's official statement. The German
official statement today, however,
says that Fort ' Douaumont is still
firmly held, though it is admitted that
the French took some first line
trenches north of Verdun.
Furious counter attacks were made
by the Germans in their efforts to re
gain a one-mile and a quarter front
from east of Douaumont to the Thiau
mont farm that was captured .yes
terday, according to the French. The
only German success was the recap
ture of a position north of the farm.
On the other side of the river Meuse
the battle lost nothing in intensity,
but no ground changed hands. Gas
and flame attacks by the Germans
near hill 304 were employed in driv
ing out the French and occupying a
trench.
USING NAVAL GUNS
The Austrian troops operating in
the Alps against the Italians have
taken many of the huge guns from
the battleships that have been bottled
up since the war began at Pola to
positions in the Alps, where they
. have been mounted and are doing ef
j fective work. The detonations of
these huge guns, a corresponfnt
i telegraphs, have actually split Allrie
. peaks and cause frequent avalancl k.
V The latest from the Austro-Italii .n
front indicates that, the Austrians
are holding their own and gaining
j some territory in the Southern Tyrol.
, Current Austrian reports claim im-
portant successes on the Lavarone
. plateau east of Astico valley, where
a hard contested battle is in progress.
The Rome statement today is silent
regarding the fighting here, but re
ports of Austrian repulses at other
points are mentioned.

MEXICAN ECONOMIC
Monetary Problem is Said to be Acute
and There is a Food Shortage ,
with No Relief in Sight
(Associated Press)
Washington, May 23. The Carran
za government is said to be facing a
serious economic situation. The mone
tary problem is already acute, there
is a food shortage in Mexico City and
there is no prospects of relief from
the strike extending virtually over all
the Mexican railroad lines.
Washington expects to get first
hand information from Consul Flet
cher at Chihuahua City, who is on his
way to Washington with reports from
five other consuls in Northern Mexico.
Special Agent Rodgers, who is in
Mexico City, informed the state de
partment today that a new note was
being prepared by Carranza, but
nothing as to its substance was re
vealed. However, while the domestic
situation is bad, the attitude of Mex
ican officials is described as more
friendly since the border conferences.
TO FILL CHRISTIAN PULPIT
Mr. R. B. Bowers, former pastor of
the Christian church here, will fill the
pulpit every other Sunday, both morn
ing and evening throughout the re
maining summer months. His first
engagement will be next Sunday, May
28th, at 11 o'clock in the morning and
at 7:30 p. m. ;';'. ; .
Mr. Bowers gave up his work in
Ocala to accept the position as prin
ciple of the high school at Eustis,
and it will be of; interest to friends
to know that the school has just
closed with the i most successful year
of its history and as a result Mr. Bow
ers has been reelected for four years.
Although only a young man of 26
years, Mr. . Bowers v introduced into
Ocala some of the highest and noblest
thought attaining toward Christian
progress. However, like all of the
deepest and most advanced thinkers,
he was not fully appreciated because
not fully understood. The world, how
ever, is making progress and there
will be many who will be indeed glad
to hear Mr. Bowers speak again in
Ocala in the interest of a practical
Christianity which is to be lived more,
and professed less.

TURNS CAR INTO
A TRAVELING HOME
H. S. French, of Muskegon, Mich.,
has just reached his home after a
trip f rom Miami, Florida. Mr. .French
and his family made the long jour
ney in a leisurely fashion in a Dodge
Brothers motor car. The important
part of the story is the clever way in
which Mr. French used his car as a
home for the tourists and not only en
joyed the "open but did away with ex
pense of stopping at hotels. :
Before starting on the trip a cook
ing outfit, and table utensils, of alumi
num was purchased, and a suit case
arranged for carrying this equipment
in the easiest manner. The back of
the front seat of the car was hinged
and a large canvas cover for the car
was purchased.
During the trip the party cooked
most of its meals in the open and
practically 'every night was spent in
the car. By letting down the hinged
back of .the front seat, a comfortable
bed was secured and the canvas Cover,
which reached the. ground all around
the car protected the party from the
elements.

class of expression, gave a reading
Absolution. She gave this beautiful
reading faultlessly, and by many it
was considered the flower of the pro-'
gram. .'v :'..';' ..'
Miss Mabel Akin, another one of
the bright pupils in expression, gave
a reading which was cleverly render
ed and greatly enjoyed. It was one

home economics in the Ocala .high
school and traced it from its small
beginning two years ago to the high

BIG MILEAGE MARKS
E By MAXWELLS
Recent Performance of Touring Cars
Show a Minimum After Cost and
Low Gasoline Consumption '
.Some recent Maxwell economy re
cords are as follows: .
In South Africa 31.3 miles on two
ounces less than a gallon of petrol.
In London, England 33.6 miles on
a hew mixture of oil and petrol.
In Seattle, Washington 43 miles
on a gallon of gasoline. ,
In Detroit, Michigan 44 miles on a
gallon of gasoline. .
In Oakland, California 45.6 miles
on a gallon of gasoline. j
The attention of the automobile
public has been drawn at various
times this spring to notable mileage
performances of Maxwell cars. In
view of the upward trend in the price
of . gasoline, a great, deal of import
ance is attached to the aftermost of
automobiles i and the officials of the
Maxwell Motor company take great
pride in the records that have! been
made by their product.
AboveTare listed some of the more
remarkable of the seriesybf economy
marks registered by Maxwells. These
are taken from a greater list of econ
omy records. Unsolicited testimonials
to the high mileage records made by
Maxwell cars are constantly coming
to the Maxwell offices at Detroit.
Oakland Run Largest
The most encouraging feature of
the economy runs is that the highest
mileage was oBtained in the more re
cent tests. The California run was
made on May 3rd. On that day, Ray
McNamara drove a stock Maxwell
touring car from Oakland, California,
tc San Jose. The mileage obtained
was 45.6 miles on a gallon of gasoline.
This run was observed by newspaper
men and by officials of the Lincoln
Highway Association and ' the San
Diego Fain
This run was a little . better than
the mark made by the same driver in
Michigan early in April, when he
droye a stock car and made an even
44 miles on a gallon. On that day,
the weather conditions were unfavor
able, the temperature being close to
freezing and a strong head wind pre
vailing most of the distance. .
In Foreign Fields
Most of the economy tests abroad
have been staged in mountainous
country and have proved the endur
ance as well as the economy of Max
well cars. The South African test
was made around Table Mountain,
which has two fairly steep gradients.

There is nothing to prevent . the
opening of the season at Hunter Park
tomorrow afternoon at 3:30, unless
it be a rain, and the fans are hoping
against Ihis. Manager Hunter says
that his bunch is in first rate condi
tioh and fast, and he expects to have
Fruitland Park sit up and take notice.
The game will be umpired by Mr.

bench. These will be Liddell, Bla
lock, Home and Leavengood.
' General admission to the park is
25 cents, with the grand stand 10
cents extra. Ladies are admitted free
to the stand.
The Ocala Athletic Association
has decided not to enter the league
with Leesburg, Sanford and Orlando.
Tkis city would have to make long
jumps. Plans for . a.V Mid-Florida
league were discussed at the meeting
in Leesburg last week, which was at
tended by Mr. C. W- Hunter, Mr. W.
Austin Bennett and Mr. G. K. Robin
son. ' '..
Not as many season tickets as de
sired have been sold yet, and it is
hoped that every fan intending to do
so will purchase a ticket at once.
Manager Hunter has worked faith
fully all winter on the park, making
several efforts to bring bis leacrue
teams here, and has now whipped
into shape what promises to be one
of .the best nines Ocala has ever had.
