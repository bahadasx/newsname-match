Slayer of 18 Americans Be

To His Execution.
Chihuahua, Mex, May 22, via El Paso
Junction. May 23. Pablo Lopez, perpe
trator of the Santa. Ysabel massacre
and author of many other outrages in
the name of Pancho Villa, who nis
faced gunfire many times without
flinching, crouched in terror before the
eyeVof a camera here today.
Thinks Execution Near.
He thought the taking of his picture
by an American newspaperman was but
the prelude to his being taken to the
notorious Santa Rosa execution place.
For hours after he had been photo
graphed he Inquired anxiously of every
warden who came near his cell If be
was about to be led forth to his death.
Since his capture, which took place
near the scene of his supreme crime,
the murder of IS Americans. Pablo has
been confined here while his wounds
are treated. When he is well again he
will be killed, it is stated.
Is Slowly Recovering.
While he is slowly recovering, the
former Villa lieutenant is unable to
stand unsupported. The inward reflec
tions he makes in his dark cell have
reduced his courage. He starts ner
vously and cries out at each footfall in
the prison corridor.
Sometimes, however, he regains his
courage and. maintaining that he was
only the tool of Villa, sserts he will
die without flinching if it is true his
country requires bis death.
Questions of policy also enter into
the delay of Lopez's execution. It is
hoped he may betray valuable informa
tion. Then, too, it is believed that his
brother, Martin, who leads a small
group of bandits, may surrender be
cause of the good treatment to Pablo.
Picks Up Rock to Throw
At Mule; Becomes Wealthy
THIS happened in the Globe minim; district in its early days. The stone
the prospector picked up was full of rich silver and he sold tie mine
for a fortune. This is but one of the many very interesting narratives
related in an article by Dan Rose, pioneer Arizona raining man, to be pub
lished this week in the Week-End Herald,
He tells of the discovery of the firet mines in the district, the rush of
prospectors, bad men and gamblers, the shortage of food because stage drivers
and freighters were killed by Indians, and of the rise of the law and the
formation of the county of Gila. It is all intensely interestwg, a word
picture of the history making days of the Great Southwest, written by a
man who had a part in the making of that history.
Readers wUI recall Mr. Rose's recent graphic description in The Herald
.of the rise and fall of McMillan. His story of the Globe district k equally
interesting.
