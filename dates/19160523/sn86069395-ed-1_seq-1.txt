Thirteen troopers of the Seventh
'cavalry were fired upon Sunday near

bandits hiding under a bridge near
the town, which is a few miles south
east of Madera on the Mexican North
western railroad. After a few shots
the Mexicans fled and the Americans
continued on their way. A small
group of Mexicans is fall'ng in behind

are chasing the "gringoes" from

CHRISTIAN UN 1Y THE RUSSIANS
PLANJPED
War in Europe Has Affected
Conditions, Says Report
to Baptists.
NO, WORLD CONFERENCE
But Committee Favors Action
That Will Bring Church
es Together.
Ashevilic, N. C, May 19. The
movement for a world conference
looking toward a church union is now
at a standsltll on account of the war
in Europe, the Southern Baptist con
vention was informed today by its
commission on World Conference on
Faith and Order.
"The question has not been wheth
er such a conference should beheld,
says the commission in its report,
"but whether- there is a willingness
among divergent bodies of believers
in the Lord Jesus for such a move
ment to bo undertaken. The question
has not yet been affirmatively decid
ed. .
"The attitude of congregational
bodies, and notably the Baptist, has
been that of watchful waiting to as
certain if there is any indication or
willingness on the part of preiatica-
bodies to enter into the discussionl
Thus far no such indication is evi
dent, except the attitude of American
Episcopalians who have led in the
movement of this continent. Ameri
can Baptists are not yet ready to yield
assent to the sacramental theories up
on which the prelacy would seem to
rest as upon essential foundation.
They are as strenuous for an author-
ative utterance as the most prelatica
communions, but with them it is the
authority of the written Word rather
than the authority of official interpre
tation of the Word."
The commission says that to many de
nominations of this country such a
conference as is hoped for will not
only be probable but really desirable.
Whether Southern Baptists should en
ter into the proposed conference with
long established prelatical communi
ties of Europe would require an ut
terance from them which they have
not given.
"Emphasis is laid upon the indis
putable Kingship of the Divine
Christ," continues the report, "for
this foundation of Christian faith ap
pears in every utterance of the di
vergent denominations. If it is pos
sible to build on that sure foundation
alone, to the exclusion of human tra
dition and strain deduction from iso
lated Scripture utterance, we surely
ought to lend countenance to a move
ment to advance that unity of Chris
tian belief and practice for which
there seems to be a general demand."
The commission recommends con
tinued participation in the movement
for Christian unity, pointing out that
America offers the greatest hope for
an ultimato union through independ
ence of established or State churches.
It strongly urges that the divisions ex
isting in largo denominations of this
country should be reconciled among
themselves and their separated groups
reunited as a step towards the unity
sought.

JOIN BRITISH
Forces Effect Junction on the
Tigris River in Mesopo
tamia After Bold Ride
TURKS FORCED TO RETIRE
Russians May Have Cut the
Bagdad Railway at Mosul
-Appearance a Surprise
London, May 22. A force of Rus
sian cavalry has joined the British
army on the Tigris, in Mesopotamia.
An official communication concern
ing the situation along the Tigris fol
lows:
Gen. Like reports that on the 19th
the enemy vacated the Bethaicssa ad
vanced the position on the right bank
of thp Tigris. Gen. Gorringe, follow
ing up the enemy, attacked and car
ried the Dujailam redoubt. The ene
my is still holding tho Sannay Yat po
sition on the left bank of the river.
"A force of Russian cavalry has
joined Gen. Gorringe after a bold and
adventurous ride."
How the important junction was ef
fected is still unknown. The suppo
sition is .that this detachment came
from the Russian army which is
threatening Khanikan, but it still re
mains a doubt where and how the
Russians succeeded in crossing the
river.
Their sudden appearance with Gen.
Gorringe also has raised the question
whether the Russians have already
cut the Bagdad railroad at Mosul. In
any case, the unexpected appearance
of this body of cavalry is as great a
surprise as was the first landing of the
Russian troops at Marseilles and is
another instance of the swift and
stealthy movement of the Russian
forces in Asia Minor.
RUSSIAN LINE STRAIGHTENED
The Russian occupation ofSakiz
and their advance upon the village of
Ban is of extreme importance and es
tablishes a direct line of communica
tion between the two Russian groups
which are operating against the Turk
ish Mesopotamian army.
Ban is near the Turkish border and,
along a 200-mile front, the Russian ar
mies are now drawn up close to the
Mesopotamian frontier. Military ex
perts believe that further progress for
the Russians should be considerably
facilitated by the straightening out oi
the Russian line and the establishment
of direct communication, which not
only makes further Kurdish inroads
impossible but lightens the difficult
task of provisioning which delayed
the Russian progress in Asia Minor.
Around Verdun the fighting be
tween the French and the Germans
continues with great violence, cspeci
1 ally between the Avocourt wood and
, the river Meuse, northwest of the
( fortress. A French first line trench
and slopes on the west of Le Mort
I Homme have been captured by the
Germans, while the French have tik-
en two German trenches on the road
, from Esnes to Haucourt. Numerous
German attacks have been repulsed.
Berlin reports that more than 1,300
French were taken prisoners and that
sextcen machine guns and eight can
non were captured in tho regiqn of
Le Mort Homme.
Except for German attempts atof
fensives against tho Russians in the
Uloukst region and' north of Lake II
sen which were repulsed there havo
been only artillery duels on the Rus
sian front.
