President Ready
to Open Channel
for Peace Talks
WILSON WILLING TO KHOW THK
WOULD Hi: IS ANXIOUS
TO ACT.
WASHINGTON, May 23. The pres
ident today was working on his ad
dress which he will deliver Saturday
morning at a meeting of the league
to enforce peace. He is confronted by
a difficult task. Strung pressure is
being brought by Americans to have
the president outline a definite peace
plan. On the other hand, Brland's
declaration that there would be no
peace until the allies won decisively.
Indicates that the entente powers do
not desire to talk peace now. Conse
quently the president probably will
content himself by notifying the world
that he is ready to open the channels
of peace talk whenever the belligerent
nations are ready He will also dis
cuss a method of preserving peace
hereafter.
Wilson is going to New York tomor

BERLIN, May 23 Philip Schiede
mann, socialist leader, Informed the
United Press today that Wilson and
Tatt were acceptable to German so
cialists as peacemakers. He added
that the appointment of a food dicta
tor would destroy the hopes for an
allied victory through a food block
ade and compel England to make
peace. He declared the socialists de
sired peace and was confident that the
Imperial chancellor wants peace He
said there was enough food for all
Germany, the only need being abso
lute control of the states which must
feed Berlin. The food dictator will
be an imperial ofticer. If the states
put their food together there will be
enough to last until the crops are
harvested. A shortage ot a few
weeks will not make the Germans sue
for peace, anyway, he said.

M ARRIX FOUND GUILTY
OF MANSLAUGHTER
William O. Whltey" Marren
was this afternoon found guilty
of manslaughter for causing the
death of Wendell C. Phillips. The
Jury went out at 11:30 o'clock
this morning and at 2 this after
noon had arrived at a verdict.
Under the instructions of the
court the jury was permitted to
find the defendant guilty of sec
ond degree murder, voluntary
manslaughter, Involuntary man
slaughter or not guilty.
The enalty for manslaughter
is imprlxoium-ut In the peniten
tiary from one to 15 yean, and a
fine not to exceed $5000.
The taking of testimony was
concluded yesterday afternoon
and this morning was devoted to
argument and Instructions to the
Jury. Only a small crowd was in
attendance during the trial.
The dying declaration of young
Phillips was an important part of the
state's case and the Jury was called
upon to choose, between the story he
told to Robert Phillips, his brother,
J. J. Jones, his friend, the doctor and
nurse and the story told by the de
fendant and Dee Matlock, the only
living witnesses of the shooting.
Young Phillips, witnesses testified,
had shown reluctance to tell of the
trouble until he had been warned by
the doctor that death was only a few
hours away. Then he told of having
resented Marren's treatment of Glenn
Rudd, of having quarreled with Mar
ren after Kudd had left the room and
then having tried to restore a friend
liness of feeling. He told also, wit
nesses testified, of Marren securina
the gun from a dresser drawer and
having pointed it at his neck. On his
death bed he declared that he grasped
the barrel of the gun and thrust it
downward and was scuffling with
Marren over it when it was discharg
ed.
The story of Marren and Matlock
was substantially different They
both testified that, during a friendly
t-cuffle, Phillips had thrown Marren
across the bed and was lying on top
of him when Matlock, who Is rather
deaf, and did not know the two were
friends, began to upbraid Phillips.
They testified that Phillips tried to
make Matlock understand that the
scuffle was friendly but that Matlock
still continued to be drunkenly angry.
Their testimony was to the effect
that Phillips secured the gun from
the drawer and struck Matlock over
the head with it. whereupon Marren
grappled with him. The gun went off
daring the struggle and the bullet
erased Marren and penetrated Phil
lips' thigh. Marren then testified that;
he helped Phillips from the room and
that they shook hands just before he
tainted.
The defense also introduced the tes- j
timony of Chief Gurdane and Officer
I Nash to the effect that Matlock had a
red murk on his head when arrested, j
The dying story of Phillips was cor- !
n.bornted to a large extent by Mrs. i
Irene Bushman, who occupied a room
adjoining and who told of hearing
througn the wall sounds of a quarrel ;
for some time before the shooting.
One man kept threatening to shoot
another, she said, and cursed him.
The other, she said, kept pleading
with him to put the gun up. There
was a short struggle then, she said,
and a gun was discharged
Counsel Peterson for the defense
made strong use of the testimony
that Phillips had refused to talk of
the shooting until after he had seen
his friend Jones and his brother. On
the other hand. District Attorney Stel
wer contended that Phillips had. like
all men of his kind, tried to shield
Marren until. In the shadow of death
he told the truth. He attacked the
stories of Marren and Matlock, de
claring It was but natural that they
'should make their stories agree.

graphic firm has already put oul
