grading and shipping the cotton in
question, and that the actual purchase
of same had previously been

Successes in French Campaign
Hani lighting is still in progress
betwe< n the Austrians and Italians in
the Tyrol, the French and the Germans
in the region of Verdun and the
Germans- and British around La
Bassee.
The great offensive of the Austnans
against the Italians in the southern
Tyrol continues unabated and at several
points the Austrians seem graduallv.to
be throwing back the Italians
toward their own territory. To tho
southeast of Trent, on the Lavarono
plateau, Vienna says the Italian.- have
been dislodged from all their positions
and that the Austrians have
raptured Finia, Mandriolo and the
height immediately west of h<- frontier
from tiie summit as far <s the
Nstaeh (Astieot valley.
The Austrians for their offensive,
according to Borne advices, have been,
heavily reinforced in men and guns.
Since the beginning of the offensive.
Vienna asserts, more than 24,000
men have been taken prisoners
and 172 cannons have been captured
by the Austrians.
In the region of Verdun both ihe
French and Germans claim success?3
for their arms at various points. An
interesting point in the latest French
official communication is the statement
that the French have penetrated
Fort Douaumont. northeast of
Verdun, which the (J. rmans stormed
and <apt red Februarv 2.V four devs
after the commencement. of the assault
on Verdun and from which a'l
attempts to drive out proved futile.
