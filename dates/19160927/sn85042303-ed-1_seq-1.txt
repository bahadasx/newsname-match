227 to 2:32 today, lived over the
jopnes of the violent explosion of oue
year ago. Sorrow for the missing,
gratitude that so many escaped tears
mingled with joy ruled for a five mln-
uto period. Thero has been many a
'five-minute period In the past twelve
months when the thoughts of Ardniore
people have gone out in tenderest sym
pathy to father and mother who had
td give up their sons and daughters,
to the widow who was'separated from
her husband, the shrieks, the groans,
the suffering, all have been lived over
time and Jlme again. The freight
house fire where husband and wife In
Jockcd arms gave their lives up to
the flames that enwrapped them. No
wonder today there is a requiem for
the dead.
v It was a sacrifice that others might
be saved. Why Ardmoro was chosen
for such a fate, no man dares to ans
wer, but wo do know that lives were
enuffed out that men should know of
the dangers of casing-head gasoline,
that they should learn to haudlo this
new commodity from the petroleum
fields of the world, that lives and prop
erty of others may be protected for all
time to come. There will never be an
explosion from the same cause again.
It Is appropriate today that we re
member the unselfish work of physi
cian, nurse and every man and wo
man who volunteered to do service for
mankind. For the telephone girl who
worked in the trying hours that oth
r might know, the telegrapher who
itaid at hla keys In a creaking buil
ding to send out messages to the out
side world, and the messenger boy
who retraced the steps where one had
in the discharge of his duty lost his
ife. It is well that we rememler,
ind honor and love the service, the
lerolsm, and the stout spirits of those
ho with tear-dimmed eyes rendered
ielp to all who suffered and who laid
o rest the bodies of those who died.
:t was a touch that made all humanl
y akin. It aroused every dormant
tympathy, it awoke tears that had
llmmed eyes infrequently before, It
nelted hearts of a populace that be
amo as one.
Just one year ago today, at 2:27, In
he afternoon, ArJtnore was devastated
iy the greatest calamity In the his
ory of the petroleum Industry. Forty
even lives were snuffed out, hun
reds were Injured, and property to
allng near the million dollar mark,

Tho cause of this calamity was nt
uted to a tank car of casing head

l Fo freight ward south of the union
epot. Tho car was shipped to the
rdmore refinery, and had been stand

CARTER COUNTY WILL BE PRO
DUCING OIL FOR A PERIOD OF
FIFTY YEARS OTHER POOLS
WILL BE DISCOVERED.
Indications are that the Fox pool
will be like the Healdton pool in the
fact that a series of sands will be
found. The drill In the McMan-Savoy
well Is now on top or another lime
shell Just like the shell which held
the first oil sand found. It is believed
that when this well has been pene
trated that another oil Band will be
discovered. The company has moved
a 2,000-batrel steel tank to the well
to take care of the oil from the first
sand, but the well has no pipe line
connection. It neither has connection
with the tank farm, and the owners
are not anxious to dovelop a great
flowing well when U has no facilities
for caring for the production. Two
prolific gas sands were found in sec
tion 28, another sand at an entirely
different depth was found In 29 and
now another sand has been found In
20. There Is no other conclusion to be
reached except that a series of sands
will be found In the rox district. The
new pool has every earmark of being
a great oil area. The oil is a live oil,
it is of better gravity than Healdton,
the surface indications are that these
sands underlie a very wide area and
the Fox pool will result In making
many millions of wealth to those who
own acreage there.
A well known oil man, In discussing
Carter county, said last night that in
his opinion Fox would be a great field.
Ho had not so regarded tho field until
oil was found. Ho thought it to be a
gas area, and did not make purchases.
But this man has changed his opinion.
Ho believes it will bo a greater field
than Healdton. Ho Is also of the opin
ion that other oil fields will be found
in the county. The mother pool of the
Santa Fo field is yet to be found, he
said, and when that area is found by
tho drill. Carte- county will have an
other great field, for a period of
fifty years Carter county will bo pro
ducing oil. The sands here are thick,
they will he producing when the upper
fields have given up their wealth and
have been abandoned. This oil man
is of the opinion that Ardmore will be
In the midst of the greatest oil activ
ity tills stato has ever witnessed.
Cushing has been heralded as a won
derful oil flel dand it deserves to be
so considered, but In the end Carter
county production will surpass that
area and a greater wealth will result
This man of broad experience Is of
the opinion that Ardmore should not
talk less figures Tor Its population
than fifty thousand people.
Promlnent Masons Here.
W. Mark Saxon, secretary of the
Masonic bodies, and John Ridpath, a
prominent Mason of McAlester, will be
here tomorrow to attend a masonic
gathering. Lodge will convene tomor

of candidates. At night a banquet will
be tendered the visitors and local Ma
sons. Peglnning at sundown tonight the

Santa Fe Seriously
Considers Fox Field
Two Ardmore Men in Chicago Office when
Fox News Came Heard Talk of New
Road. Interurban Talked Also.
When Bert Simpson and Denny Fitz
gerald, who left here on a business
trip Sunday night, nrrived In Chicago,
they found waiting them a telegram
fromT. H. Dunn of mis city notifying
them that a well had been drilled in
at Fox and suggesting that tho Santa
Fo be seen at once concerning the
building of a road from this town to
that district.
A telegram came last night from Mr.
Simpson and Mr. Fitzgerald Inform
ing Mr. Dunn that they had had a
very satisfactory conference with the
Santa Fo officials, In which the rail
road men promised to give the matter
early and serious consideration.
I Dorsett Carter, the railroad wizard
of Oklahoma, who Is connected with
the Santa Fe, has stated privately that
when the Fox area became an oil
producing area that his company
would build a line from Ardmore to
that place.
It Is also known that an interurban
proposition has been seriously con
sidered for several monthfc, and plani
have been made and are now being
matured for the construction of an
electric line to Fox. This road plans
to touch the beautiful and productive
Springer valley and also to touch the
asphalt deposits at Woodford and to
build on to the wonderful oil area on
the western side of the county.
It is hinted in some circles that the
interurban now at Norman would be
extended Into the Carter county oil
fields. Just a little commcn sense
applied In reasoning this out will
eliminate all fear of the construction
of such a line. The gre,at bulk of
the travel to Fox will come from Ard
more. The workers and the scouts
will live here. The brokers and the
oil men will live here, they will make
all the oil deals here, where the rec
ords are handy, where the banks are
located and where business can be
transacted.
There Is a reasonable hope that
either an electric line or a steam line
of road will be built to Fox within
twelve months or earlier from here

If It were left to Ardmore to take
choice of tho kind of road it would
rather have, it would select the elec
tric line.
It is very probable that by next
Sunday an Important announcement
will be made through Tho Ardmoreito
concerning the building of this road.

ROSE LAWN SOUTH OF THE CITY

BY BOARD OF CITY COMMIS
SIONERS. FINE LOCATION.
Another addition has been taken
Into the corporate limits of the city
when last night the board of city
commissioners voted to take in Rose
Lawn addition in the southwest por
tion of the city consisting of a little
more than two acres. This is a por
tion of the McLlsh place and is in
a very attractive community. The
addition will find ready customers
for the lots as some of the best resi
dences In the city have already been
erected near this property.
"Ardmore Is rapidly expanding"
remarked one of the commissioners
"and It is a healthy indication to
see that more room is required for
residences aa the older sections of
the city are already nearly filled to
capacity." Commenting further he
stated that he knew of several fami
lies who were even now awaiting for
some of the bungalos under construc
tion to be finished aa they were

At the meeting of the board of city
commissioners last night the white

the city attorney told the commis
sioners of the action of the business
mens' association and tho chamber
of commerce at a recent meeting and
assured the commissioners that
those two bodies were a unit In
wanting the white way constructed.
A committee from those two bodies
was appointed to confer with the
city commissioners and they will
meet with them at tholr next regu
lar meeting Tuesday night at which
time It is expected definite plans
for calling the election will be for-
mutated,
Every citizen who has been Inter-
viewed on the subject Is in favor of
the new system after it has been
explained to them, the added beauty
to tho city would be worth all It will

merce of Ardmore.
We, jour committee appointed to
Investigate the contract for the
white way nnd tho Inadequate fire
protection beg to report as follows:
The "White Way" seems on its
face to be a proposition which should
appeal to the pcoplo of tho city. It
does not appeur to place any greater
burden on the city than it already
has and the reduction of tho price
to consumers seem to offset he ex
tra cost entailed by the white way.
We recommend that a mass meet
ing of the citizens of Ardmore be
called at once to hear the proposi
tion In Its exact status as will be
presented when the vote Is taken.
We feel sure that said mass meet
Ing will view the matter favorably
and will request the commissioners
to call the election. On the matter
of the Inadequacy of fire protection
we feel that this matter Is too Im
portant for Immediate action and do
not care for the responsibility on
such short notice. We recommend
that a special committee be appoint
ed to get full particulars from the
commissioners and make a thorough
Investigation of the present system
and every detail necessary to make it
efficient Y'our committee in making
this recommendation does not wish
to shirk a duty but acts on the pre-

NUMBER 305.
by Landes Process.
Right is Coming
11. (J. McKeever of Knld, Okla., who
owns tho Carter county rilits for the
hundes process of refining crude) oil,
will bo here next week to tako up with
the Healdton field producers the prop
osition of building a refinery at Ard
more. Two cars of Healdton crudo have
been tested by the Landes process In
a refinery at Nashville, Tenn. This
test showed IS pel cent of gasoline of
58 gravity and 10 per cent of gasoline
of 52 gravity. The lowest grade turn
ed out Is very flno ror motor spirits
and this meuns that the new process
will make 28 per cent gasoline out of
Healdton crude.
A pipe lino owned by Ardmore pro
ducers, a refinery owned by the same
people, ought to be a paying proposi
tion. Oil refineries mnko money un
der the old process of refining, and
under the new process there ought tj
be no doubt about it being a payhig
institution. The Texas pipe lino and
the Guffey pipe line, both of which
will In all probability be built Into
the southern fields, will not be of ser
vice directly to Ardmore. They will
be of service to the field as a whole,
and indirectly to Ardmore by aiding
the local producers in providing a
market for tholr production. But a
local line owned by noma people can
be made to do a great service for the
city.
The residuum of this refinery would
I ha for sain. It is natural that the
lowners wuld seek out local instltu-
Hons to sell that oil to. They would
advertise for factories, they would
seek to build up a local market for
the entire production of the refinery,
and that would build a bucket brl
gado In Ardmore that would build a
much larger city than we have at this
time. .
T. II. Dunn of this city, who Is a
Healdton producer, and who la keenly
people are anxious to know exacti?
what they can do before they make
an investment In tho refinery.
