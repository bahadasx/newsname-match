DEMOCRATS READY
FOR FALLBUSINESS
GLOTZBACH HEAD OF COUNTY
ORGANIZATION. OTHERS
ARE CHOSEN.
POSTMASTERS NOT ALLOWED
TO INDULGE POLITICAL
PROPENSITIES.
A Last Wednesday afternoon the staunch
a true Democrats of the County met
in mass convention at Turner Hall for
the purpose of perfecting a county
organization in compliance with the
request of Fred Wheaton, Chairman of
the Democratic State Central Com
mittee. Altho the call for the conven
tion did not reach the party workers
until a couple of days before the time
set for the meeting, a representative
gathering materialized nevertheless.
There was a noticable absence of several
Democrats who had in previous con
ventions taken an active part in the
councils of the party, but this apparently
did not have any particularly depressing
effect on those present. They had come
together for the purpose of organizing
and this was accomplished in a most
satisfactory manner.
Not only was the county committee
selected, but committee men were
chosen for each voting precinct in the
\County. As another evidence of the
1 spirit of the meeting may be mentioned
the fact that by passing the hat around
$52.00 was collected among those present
for campaign purposes. No one shirked
this important duty.
The meeting was called to order by
Fred Pfaender, the former chairman of
the county committee. He read the
call and the meeting organized by elect
ing William Brust of Sleepy Eye as
Chairman and Arthur L. Boock of this
city as secretary. When it came to the
^election of a county committee it was
$}ade known that three of the former
members of to committee, by reason
of their appointment as postmasters had
thereby been placed outside the pale of
committee work, the postal regulations
forbidding political activity on the part
of those holding federal positions. This
necessitated a re-arrangement of the
county committee and it was decided to
have a committee of five go over the
situation and report six names of persons
who were willing to serve in this capacity.
A such committee Chairman Brust ap
pointed Jos. J. Sperl of Searles, Wm.
Mueller of Springfield, C. P. Block of
Sleepy Eye and Fred Pfaender and
Athanas Henle of New Ulm. After a
short recess these reported as their choice
Jos. J. Sperl of Cottonwood Frank Ber
berich of Springfield M. B. Erickson of
Hanska George Glotzbach of Sleepy
Eye and Jos. J. Smasal and Christ Filzen
of New Ulm. These names were con
firmed by the meeting and the com
mitteemen thereupon retired for the
purpose of perfecting an organization
and reported shortly that they had
selected George Glotzbach as Chairman
Jos. J. Smasal as Secretary and Christ
Filzen as Treasurer. The following
precinct committee men were then
chosen:
New Ulm, 1st ward—A. S. Dorn,
Henry Engel, A. L. Boock.
New Ulm, 2nd ward—Anton Henle,
Alex Kanweiler, Otto Penkert.
New Ulm, 3rd ward—Louie Sandau,
John Henle, Ben. I. Vetter.
Sleepy Eye—F. E. Palmer, C. P. Black,
A. M. Berg.
Springfield—Ed. Satterlee, J. J. Schu
macher, Ora Trautman.
Comfrey—Jos. J. Schumacher, Theo.
Englof, Frank Schwertzler.
Hanska—Chris Hansen.
Evan—W. G. McPhee.
Cobden—J. P. Ed. Bertrand.
Albin—Hans Sigurdsen, John Keim.
Bashaw—Anton J. Fischer.
Burnstown—Jos. B. Augustine.
Cottonwood—Anton Deutsch, J. W.
-Haas.
Eden—Edw. McGowan.
Home—F. A. Tuttle, John Schmitz.
Lake Hanska—Albert Amundsen.
Leavenworth—Nic. Schwartz.
Linden—Ole Peterson.
Milford—Henry Meyer, Ed. Hensel.
Mulligan—M. G. Krzmarzick.
North Star—J. J. Ryan.
Prairieville—Chris Olsen, S. C. Fred
erickseir.
Sigel—Thomas Stadeck, Hubert Hilles
heim.
Stark—Anton Ruby.
Stately—H. F. Turbes.
Before adjournment the retiring mem
srs of the county committee some of
horn had held the job for almost
twenty years were given a rising vote of
thanks for their services in behalf of the
party in the past. George Glotzbach,
the new head of the county committee,
is one of the Wilson presidential electors.
Upon assuming charge of the meeting he
gave a short talk in which he promised
the Democrats of the County an active
campaign and urged upon all to work
together harmoniously from now until
the campaign closes, expressing his con
fidence that Wilson would be re-elected.
REPUBLICAN RALLY AT ARMORY
Late yesterday it was ascertained that
Frank B. Kellogg, Republican nominee
for United States Senator would be in
New Ulm next Monday and the local
committee immediately got busy to
make arrangements for a big meet. The
New Ulm Concert Band will provide the
music and the rally will be held in the
Armory.
ORDERS RECEIVED
FOR BORDER DUTY
OFFICERS AT LLANO GRANDE
HAVE NO ENCOURAGING
REPORTS
LIEUT. KLAUSE DETAINED AT
CAMP HOSPITAL FOR
MALARIA
Rather discouraging are the reports
received by the home folks who have
heard recently from the men in Texas.
Last week there was hope that they
would be back by the first of December
but recent advices would indicate that
as yet there is no plan for their return.
A letter received from Lieut. Klause this
week states that there is no sign of any
preparation for return and that further
more they have been told that within a
few weeks they will be sent to patrol the
border.
Another apparent indication that the
stay of the men is not to lie cut short at
this time is the arrival of fresh troops at
the front. Mr. Klause jnrote that new
men had recently arrived and were
pitching their tents near the Second
Minnesota. He did not state where the
troops were from.
Lieut. Klause writes also of having
visited the officers confined at the
Hospital and while there he had a blood
test made and discovered to his great
surprise that he was full of malarial fever
germs. He had not felt ill and thought
it was a joke they were putting up on
him but when he was detained at the
Hospital for observation he began to
understand that the physicians were in
earnest. However, he did not feel at all
sick at the time of writing which was two
days after the test was made, according
to Lieut. Klause, and rather enjoyed the
chance to rest up at the Hospital as he
was not allowed to go back to camp for
duty.J
CAMBRIA DOWN ON DEAD BEATS
Cambria business men have the right
idea and do not intend to let the fellows
who are long on promises and short on
performance get next to the hard earned
wealth of those who pay as they go.
They have decided to givd the dead
beats just about a month to straighten
up their accounts and then no more
credit will be given those who fai^-to
come across with coin of the realm in
place of promises. It would look as tho
New Ulm might be due for an immigra
tion from Cambria for business men here
are easier than that.
S. S. CONVENTION THIS WEEK.
Springfield will be hostess this week,
Sept. 28th, to the various Sunday School
organizations of Brown County which
will meet in convention in that city
Thursday morning. The meetings will
be held in the German Methodist church.
Quite a large number will probably
attend from New Ulm. Sen. L. E.
Potter is among the speakers and his
topic will be "The Man In The Sunday
School." Rev. C. Hohn will speak on
"Workers' Meetings", Rev. Wheeler
will talk about "The Boy in the Sunday
School." G. A. Ottomeyer is treasurer
of the organization and Dr. Reineke is
president.
Sanitary Engineer Childs of the Min
nesota State Board of Health was in New
Ulm Monday for the purpose of making
an examination of the city water. There
has been no special call for this examina
tion and it indicates merely a routine
duty with the Board of Health.

GOAL OIL JOHNNY
GETS SEYERE JOLT
CARL JAEGER DISCOVERS AT
GASOLINE IS UNNECESSARY
-, LUXURY.
PRODUCES CHEAP SUBSTITUTE
WHICH KNOCKS SPOTS OFF
GASOLINE.
What promises to put a crimp into
gasoline prices and back Rockefeller and
the Standard Oil off the boards is an
invention or rather a discovery claimed
to have been made by Carl Jaeger of
Minneapolis who is known to quite a
number of people here as the promotor
of the Northwestern Battery Co. Mr.
Jaeger claims to have produced a sub
stitute for gasoline. He was in the city
Saturday in connection with matters
pertaining to the Northwestern Battery
Co. and discussed his invention with the
Review.
The preparation is made of coal tar
but the formula he was not willing to dis
close. If his invention turns out to be
the success he claims for it, it will simply
revolutionize automobile traffic and cut
such a big hole in the dividends of
Standard Oil that their stock will certain
ly take a tumble. Besides that it will
prevent Rockefeller from making such
large donations to various institutions
of learning and otherwise unless he
immediately raises the price of kerosene
to increase his returns, so that he can
still afford to be generous with endow
ments without attacking his capital.
According to Mr. Jaeger his prepara
tion is in paste form and is sold in tubes.
All you have to do is to dissolve this
paste in water and pour the liquid into
that part of the machine that is now the
receptacle for gasoline and then start on
your joy ride. It does the business just
as effectively as gasoline, only more so.
Tests have shown that a Ford can be
run about sixteen miles with one gallon
of higii test gasoline which at present
market prices is worth 24 cents. With
a gallon of Jaeger's substitute you can
travel in your flivver more than twenty
miles. And what is more, Jaeger claims
for his preparation that it can be manu
factured at a profit if sold at 10c a gallon.
That the preparation does the business
has been conclusively demonstrated.
It was demonstrated for about three
weeks at Philadelphia from which place
Mr. Jaeger only recently returned and he
has in his possession telegrams from
moneyed men who urge him to return to
the city of Brotherly Love as soon as he
can because there are all kinds of people
who are ready and waiting to invest their
money and run opposition to Coal Oil
John.
The substitute was also tried out
successfully at Minneapolis a week ago
Saturday when Henry Ford's manager
of Detroit was present to see the demon
stration. So impressed was he with the
possibilities of this preparation that he
immediately got into touch with Henry
himself who is now on a business trip in
the West and Ford has notified Mr.
Jaeger that on his return trip which will
be some time this week he will stop off
at Minneapolis and make the necessary
investigations himself.
But we need not go as far as Phila
delphia or even to Minneapolis for evi
dence that the substitute does the busi
ness, because it was tried out right here
in New Ulm. Dr. Fntsche tried it out
\uth his Dodge last Saturday morning
and he informs the Review that he could
not see any difference in the results
between actual gasoline and the sub
stitute. He had his chauffeur with him
and they took a spin of about seven
miles into the country using the substi
tute only. For a time the speed limits
were ignored, at least the Mayor thinks
so, from the way the chauffeur made the
car hit the trail. Whether going at
high, low or intermediate, crawling
along at a snail's pace or imitating a
speed maniac, the substitute was always
on the job, and did as effective work as
the highest priced gasoline.
There is therefore no question about
Jaeger's substitute producing the neces
sary energy. The only question that
remains to be solved is whether or not
it can be manufactured as cheaply as the
inventor claims it can. If it can, then
the Standard Oil monopoly is destined
to receive a solar plexus blow from
which it is doomed never to recover
unless they grab off the supply of the
necessary ingredients of the Jaeger pre
paration.-
The Guild of St. Peters Episcopal
Church will hold their regular coffee
social today (Wednesday) at the Guild
Hall.

FESTIVAL PREPARED
IN PIONEERS HONOR
QLD SETTLERS WILL BE GIVEN
ANNIVERSARY
OF ARRIVAL
BANQUET ON
ONLY ONE SURVIVOR OF FIRST
PARTY LIVING.—NINETY
PIONEERS.
October 7th it will be 62 years since
the advance party of the first settlers
reached the Town of Milford in this
County, according to Peter Mack, the
sole surviving member of the party
which arrived here. For some years the
Junior Pioneers have held their annual
meeting on this anniversary day and have
given a banquet for the old folks and this
year the old pioneers will again be guests
of the Junior Pioneers at a banquet to be
given at Turner Hall Sunday, October
8th.
The committee in charge of the ar
rangements assumed the responsibility
of changing the date of this function
from Saturday, October 7th to Sunday,
October 8th, because in their judgment
Sunday will be more convenient to both
old and young and a larger attendance
can probably be secured on that day.
Altho it is 62 years since the first settlers,
arrived and 54 years since the Indian
Massacre, there are still in the neighbor
hood of 90 old settlers left. There are
included in this number wives and
widows of pioneers who were not here
themselves during the Indian Massacre
or were too young to take active part in
the defense of New Ulm.
The committee which has this matter
in hand is earnestly at work and notices
were sent out Tuesday to the Junior
Pioneers calling attention to the annual
meeting which is scheduled to be held at
Turner Hall Sunday afternoon at 3
o'clock and to the banquet, the hour for
which has been fixed at 5 o'clock. A
tentative program lias been prepared
According to which the old folks will
assemble in the lecture room of Turner
Hall at 4 o'clock where they will be
entertained until the time for the ban
quet. At the banquet there will be
musical numbers and a few brief talks, a
program that is so short that it will not
tire the old folks. It is expected that the
entire domes will all be over by 8 o'clock.
The committee has prepared a list of
pioneers which is appended hereto.
Should any names have been omitted the
committee would be pleased to have their
attention called to it and also if the list
carries names of those who are not
pioneers. It is the intention of the com
mittee to get the list accurate and the
members will appreciate any and all out
side assistance. The following are classed

FATALLY INJURED
IN ADTO ACCIDENT
MEMBER OF LAMBERTON SCHOOL
FACULTY DIES AT LORETTO
HOSPITAL.
INEXPERIENCED DRIVER LOSES
CONTROL OF CAR WHICH
OVERTURNS.
Friday evening Adolf Ruehl, the head
of the agricultural department of the
Lamberton schools died at the Loretto
Hospital from the effects of injuries re
ceived in an auto accident the day
previous. He was brought down here
by auto Friday afternoon about four
o'clock for the purpose of undergoing an
operation. The surgeon made an ex
ploratory insertion and discovered that
the man was so terribly injured that
there could be no hope of saving his life
by an operationuand jaothing. further was
attempted? The abdomen was filled
with blood from the internal wounds, the
liver was torn as was the lining of the
abdominal cavity and the intestines were
perforated. The unfortunate man died
during the evening. The fatal accident
happened near Walnut Grove Thursday,
September 21st. Professor Ruehl had
gone to Tracy that day with an auto
load of boys from his department for the
purpose of judging stock. On the re
turn trip, one of the boys asked for per
mission to run the car to which the
Professor kindly consented. It was only
a short while after the young man had
taken the steering wheel that he lost
control of the machine. The car turned
turtle and landed in the ditch, falling
on top of Ruehl. He was extricated,
the car righted and altho he suffered con
siderable pain he managed to drive the
car home to Lamberton. It is claimed
that he even made a tire change after
the accident. It is self-evident that he
did not realize the seriousness of his
condition, because it took considerable
persuasion on the part of his Lamberton
friends before he decided to come to New
Ulm for hospital treatment.
The remains were shipped to Lamber
ton the same night. Mrs. Ruehl was
visiting in Milwaukee and because he
was a native of Wisconsin, it was planned
to take the remains there for interment.
At the time of his death the deceased
was 39 years, 9 months and 12 days old.
He was of a cheerful disposition and had
made a host of friends since he came to
Lamberton about a year ago.
CLUB YEAR BEGINS NEXT WEEK
Members of the Commercial Club
are all egarnestly urged to be present at
the first meeting of the winter season to
be held next Wednesday evening, at the
Club Rooms. Upon the first meeting
depends to a great extent the success
of the year's undertakings and the Club
has need to look alive this year or it
will fall behind the other bodies of like
nature in the state. The past summer
was so exceedingly hot that everyone
wearied in well-doing and nothing was
accomplished to speak of, individually
or collectively. There is much to be
done. No sociability tours have been
pulled off this year, the "kids" have not
had their promised trip, nothing especial
has been done to extend the name and
fame of the city and we have all sat
pretty much at home, forgotten by con
ventions because we had rather more
than our share of them last year and the
year before. It is high time that some
new methods of bringing the town into
favorable notice be thought up by the
men at the head of affairs and every one
interested in the city's well-doing should
be present at the meeting. .r^:^
SLEEPY EYE SEES
HER BIGGEST DAY
CITY ENTERTAINS FIFTEEN
THOUSAND GUESTS LAST
SUNDAY
CATHOLIC SOCIETIES OF MINNJ
HOLD A THREE DAYS
SESSION
Visitors variously estimated as num~
bering between 5,000 and 15,000 thronged
the streets of Sleepy Eye last Sunday, the Z£.
opening day of the annual convention of
the German Catholic Societies of the
State of Minnesota. By far the largest 1|
crowd of people that ever congregated in
Sleepy Eye were present and the fondest
dreams of the most sanguine pro- "3
moters of the convention who figured
on a 5,000 crowd if the weather con
ditions should be right were more than
realized. Nothing better in the shape
of weather could have been wished for
and that with the good roads brought l^i
out the people.
They came from all directions and
their cars literally lined the streets of
Sleepy Eye and all other public and C5
open spaces. The number of cars in
Sleepy Eye Sunday is variously esti
mated, but it is a conservative guess to
say that there were more than a thousand.
A special train consisting of 12 coaches
from the Twin Cities brought in the
neighborhood of twelve hundred people
alone. In the morning 290 tickets
were sold here and in the afternoon:
another 30. These with the New Ulmites
who went by auto would bring New
Ulm's contingent at the celebration up 1?
to 900, the best attendance from a
city that Sent delegations. Three
thousand meals were served alone during: J*5
the noon hour at the St. Mary's school 3|j
house. j3
The festivities in the morning were ~si*
opened as early as 8:30_ when there was^ss ,~
a reception lor tie delegates at S 5
Mary'* school. Ac this time the badges
were distributed to them. At lOVcIock
there was a pontifical high mass witk,,_ $
Bishop Trobec as celebrant. Bishop
Busch delivered the sermon for the
occasion.
The parade was held the afternoon |p
and was scheduled to start at 2:15. It 3
was composed of six divisions and was
approximately 15 blocks long. It was ij
headed by the city police of Sleepy Eye
carrying U. S. flags. They were followed J"
by the St. Mary's cadets, about 80 in
number in white uniforms. Then came yt?i
the Grand Marshall of the parade, M. A. ^\Z
Weiskopf of St. Paul, with A. J. Bertrand *jS
as chief of staff and J. P. Schmitz and
Frank Pinzka, as aides. Then came the j*
Sleepy Eye band with the delegates "Z4
from the various societies. The first j&
division was headed by the St. Peter 3?
band, followed by the St. Peter society,
the Swan Lake society and the Manda ^3
society. In the second division were
the Mankato band, the Mankato society,. ".3
the Searles society and the Comfrey
society. New Ulm represented the third -fj
division. They were headed by the Ex- f|
Regiment band, the St. Joseph society,
the Catholic Forester sand St. Patrick Ip
Council of this city. In the fourth di- j|f
vision were the Fairfax society, the Bird \"j*
Island society and the West Newton ^"a
society. They were headed by the 1
Fairfax band. Preceded by the Lucan
band the Wabasso society, Clements ^T^
society, Lucan society and Leavenworth -*n&
society formed the fifth division. The
sixth and last division was headed by -J^
the Orpheus band of Springfield. Fol- ^T~
lowing them were the Springfield society v*§
and the Catholic Foresters, Young Men's Jjspr
society and St. John's society of Sleepy iff*
Eye.
After the parade there was a program
of speeches and song numbers at SU
Mary's Auditorium. The program was
opened with a song by the choir, followed*
by an address of welcome by Mayorf
Wellcome. After another there"
song
came an address by Mr. Budentz of St.^,^
Louis on "Young Men's Sodalities" andt-'*
another orison the "Task of Woman"r/^i
by Rev. S. Schirmers of Melrose. In the'^'f'1
evening beginning at 8 o'clock there?*£§
was also a program at the auditorium. gg*
The actual work of the convention*^
lasted until this (Wednesday) morning.!^
Monday morning at 7:15 the delegates'
assembled and at 7:30 attended solemnf^
high mass with sermon by Rev. A*2f§
