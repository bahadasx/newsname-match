THE COUNTY NEWS-HE
GRAND MARAIS, COOK COUNTY, MINN., SEPTEMBER' 27, 1916.
ARRANGEMENTS COM­
PLETED FOR COUNTY FAIR
Outlook Favorable for a Very Suc­
cessful Exhibit of County
Products.
The board of managers the
Coek County Fair has been verv busy
making all the necessary arumge
ments and preparations for 'their
second annual fair which pror~hes
well, judging by the interest si. *wri
by the public.
The Extension Division of the Un­
iversity of Minnesota is sending Sup­
erintendent Thompson of the North­
eastern Experiment Station at Du­
luth and County Agent Larson of St.
Louis county to act as judges of
live stock and field and garden crops.
Superintendent Thompson will be
accompanied by his poultryman who
will act as judge of the poultry ex­
hibit. State Dairy Inspector Lind
berg of North Branch, Minn., is ex­
pected to be present as judge of the
dairy products.
A number of out-of-town visitors
are expected as well as a large part
of our county residents, and every­
thing points to success for the so­
ciety, the weather man included.
The towns of Lutsen, Tofte and
Schroeder have generously aided the
society in the sum of $50.00 each.
The County Board donated $100.00
and most of the remaining towns, it
is hoped, will take favorable action
in the near future.
We would like to see every farmer
in the county at the fair, in the
hope that more of them would wake
up to the fact that the farm should
receive their undivided attention,
and that instead of using the farm
for an auxiliary for the home table
they would increase their tilled ac­
reage from year to year as some of
our px*ogressive farmers have done.
The need of Cook county is more
farmers and more tilled acreage.
One progressive farmer who does not
slight his farm is worth more to the
county than a dozen of the others.
We are not writing this article as a
slam on the farmers of the county
as a whole, as it has been demon­
strated that we have quite a number
whose main- idea is "MY FARM" and
not the question of how much nwjfc*
work there will be next year. Sue
cess has been the reward of those
who have not slighted their farms
and they are the ones who keep an
account in the bank, who are living
in comfortable homes and whose
stock is well taken care of, and
whose ideas are not always pessi­
mistic in regard to anything or any­
body.
Improvements in Village Streets
The road work which has been donie
in the village strets the past ten
days shows up nicely and while the
roads are not yet well packed, they
will improve gradually as the travel
wears them down and will result in
roads that can be dragged and kept
in shape without having to resort
to more expensive road-making me­
thods. The drainage ditches have
been moved out into the street about
eight feet, leaving room for tree
planting or other beautifying im­
provements between the sidewalks
and the ditch. The total amount ex­
pended by the village will be about
four hundred dollars.
A farmer down in Texas is said to
have found recently on his farm sev­
eral thousand dollars in silver bars
that he turned up while plowing a
field. The story may or may not be
true, but it is true that thorough
plowing and cultivating will enable
almost any farmer to get, not silver
bars, but crops that will be worth
thousands of dollars. Usually the
man who says that farming does not
pay is the man who does not farm
properly. The up-to-date farmer who
mixes brains with his labor does not
find fault with farming. Instead of
complaining about poor crops, hard
work and no profit he enjoys his
work, sings like a lark, keeps first
class stock. He is the man who has
big bank account and an automobile
that is paid for.
The point of rocks extending into
the East Bay, commonly called "The
Rocks" is a beauty spot if there ever
was one and should be preserved for
the future before commercialism
sways its mighty scythe and ruins
it as a public beauty spot.
Dr. and Mrs. T. M. Robertson and
family, Mrs. Titus and daughter Thel
ma, and Emil Hall left for Duluth
on Sunday morning. Dr. Robertson
and family were on the way to" their
home in Coffeyvilie, Kans., and the
balance of the party will visit in Du­
luth a short time before returning.

WHEW—THINK OF WHAT
MIGHT HAVE BEEN
One of our good citizens had an
experience the other evening that
demonstrated his suavity beyond
question. He was at home taking
care of the children while his wife
was at the movies, when he heard
a noise in the cellar. He procured
a flash and went down to investi­
gate and discovered that the culprit
was a small dark animal with a broad
white stripe along its back, and he
made a stragetic retreat. He was
nonplussed for a moment but pro­
curing a plank he put it in the win­
dow through which the animal got
in and made a nice smooth walk
from the cellar floor to the window
for the exit. He went back to his
reading and after some time made
another examination of the cellar
and found the animal gone. When
his wife returned he told her of the
find in the cellar and she immediate­
ly went to the cellar entrance and
sniffed, and said that she couldn't
smell anything. She was very curi­
ous as to how her husband had got
the animal to walk the plank and
he finally told her. that after
he placed it there he went down and
politely bowed and invited it for a
walk and the animal complied.
To Organize Sunday School.
Undersigned has been requested to
make known the following desire of
a few of the people residing in the
village of Grand Marais.
Wheras we find it our Christian
duty to impart to our children, the
faith which we cherish, we believe
that this can best be done in a Sun­
day School conducted in the mother
tongue. We ourselves have had the
religious training in that language
and thus are better able to give
them further information on the vi­
tal questions that come up in reli­
gious activities.
Therefore we hope to organize a
Sunday school for this purpose on
Sunday October 1st, at 12:30 p. m.
in the Norwegian Lutheran church.

FOREST RANGER BAYLE
RESCUES MAN IN WOODS
Forest Ranger P. J. Bayle returned
this afternoon from a ten days in­
spection trip of the northern part
of the county. Mi*. Bayle was ac­
companied by his wife, and the trip
proved interesting and eventful.
On last Saturday about one o'clock
as they were canoeing on Gunfiint
lake they heard what sounded like
a man yelling, and from time to time
they heard it for over an hour. They
were going against the wind so there
was no possibility of judging how
far, or just where the sound came
from. About five o'clock they saw
a smoke from a camp fire in the dis­
tance and they made for it. They
had not heard any repetition of the
yelling they heard earlier in the day
but Ranger Bayle Bayle thought
that the yelling was that of a man
in distress, and he wanted to see
who was at the camp fire.
When he came up to the camp fire
there was a man whose clothes were
tattered and torn and whose looks
showed that he was lost in the
woods. The astonishment in the
man's face in seeing Mr. and Mrs.
Bayle in the canoe was very evident,
and after getting the man a good
square meal he told them his story.
He had left Grand Marais about
eight days ago, bound for Canada
via Gunfiint, and had followed the
road and telephone wire for a long
distance according to directions he
had received from some one he had
met on the road. The telephone line
quite often left the road for a short
distance and then came out again a
little farther on and the man had
been trying to follow the road and
became hopelessly lost. He had not
had anything to eat for about a week
except leaves, and when given food
ate ravenously. He gave his name as
Jim Vishen, a Russian, and age as
75 years. When found he was only
about a mile from the railroad at
Gunfiint, but he had lost all hope of
rescue and would probably not have
lived had he not been found by Ran­
ger Bayle.
The Princess theatre will show
every night this week, special pro­
grams being on the bill every night.
The faculty of the Grand Marais
Public Schools was entertained at a
picnic supper on the rocks on Mon­
day evening by Misses Merle Lien
and Lillian Reidesel.
Dr. J. A. Murphy, of the Indian
Department, of Washington, D. C.,
was in the village on official business
last*week. He was accompanied by
his
wife.
WILL ASK FOR FEDERAL4
AID ON GUNFLINT
County Commissioners Take Steps
to Apply for Federal Aid
In Road Building
At the meeting of the County
Board held last Saturday, a resolu­
tion was adopted to make applica­
tion to the Federal Government for
aid in re-building the Gunfiint road.
This road runs for the greater part
through the National Forest Re­
serve, and about half of the land
embraced in the reserve is owned by
private parties and the other half
by the Government. The known
presence of valuable minerals in the
territory adjacent to the road is suf­
ficient reason for the building of
the road, and as the property to be
benefited by the road is largely
owned by "Uncle Sam" it is only fair
that Federal aid on this road be
granted. The natural beauties of
the territory through which it goes
will make the road popular to tour­
ists. These arguments and others
have been advanced to the depart­
ment in Washington and it is hoped
that the aid will be secured.
The county board made an inspec­
tion trip to the Brule on Saturday.
MAPLE HILL NOTES

While here they were the guests of
M. and Mrs. Ole Larson.
An. interesting meeting of the M.
H. Literary Society was held at the
church Monday evening, each one
showed great interest in the future
welfare of the club. A good pro­
gram was rendered.
Governor J. A. A. Burnquist has
designated October 9th as "Fire
Prevention Day" in a proclomation
issued by him. The purposeof the
day is to make a concentrated effort
to reduce the danger of fires. State
Fire Marshall Robert W. Hargadine
suggests that in live communities
Mayors will take action calling at­
tention to the day and its purpose
the subject will be taken up in the
schools calling attention to the dan­
ger of the small boy with a match
etc., men and women will look about
their homes, the attic, the basement,
back yard and other accumulations
that make for fire danger. A move­
ment of this sort would result in a
material reductionn in the danger of
fire in a community and should re­
ceive the co-operation of the people
of the State.

His Recommendation
A young man found it difficult to meet the
request for a recommendation when he sought
a new position in a strange city.
Finally he thought of his bank book and at
the next interview produced the same as a re­
commendation of his thrift and industry.
The novelty of the idea linked with the
continuity of deposits shown by the book, se­
cured the position for him without further in­
quiry.
Have you a recommendation of this kind
to back you, should you lose your present po­
sition? If not, get a pass book today and de­
posit your money with

CH ORE MUST BE SHIPPED

en. Whether or
ill be sufficient
ugh the winter
gether upon the
not. stocks
to carry
depends almost
lateness of the opening of naviga­
tion next spring they say.
The plants in the east are now es­
timated to be consuming 5,500,000
tons of ore monthly, the consump­
tion for the year being placed at
65,000,000 tons. It is figured that
the ore shipments for the season
may be under 61,000,000 tons, so that
a shortage of around 4,000,000 tons
is regarded as probable. If ship­
ping, however can be continued be­
yond Nov. 15th, it is thought that
the deficiency may be made up.
Commenting upon ore supply con­
ditions the Wall Street Journal says:
"If the cold season is of normal
length, or about five months, a sup­
ply of 28,000,000 would keep the fur­
naces at full capacity until the re­
sumption of shipments. And the
trade expects the stocks will be a
bout that size. Any prolongation
of cold weather, delaying the resum­
ption of shipping for two weeks or
more may force curtailedconditions.
"One thing I know" says apromi
nent steel man, "we won't have any
surplus.
"It has been by means ofthe most
strenous efforts that the situation
is not more threning than it is The
possibility of an ore shortage was
seen from the beginng of the pre­
sent season and shipments have been
rushed to the utmost, breaking all
previous records. In August alone
lake ore shipments were closed to
the 10,000,000-ton mark.
"Ore producers have been assisted
by high water in the lakes this sea­
son, which has made it possible to
send heavier loads than usual.
"Little assistance seem to be ex­
pected from sending ore by rail. It
is pointed out that the cost of rail
transportation would add* several
dollars a ton to the cost of iron and
steel and that even if ore were thus
sent it would freeze in transit and
be- very difficult to- unload and
ha_ndle. Further, it is questioned
whether the roads tapping the lake
ore regions have sufficient capacity
to take up any important shortage.
"It is expected that higher ore
freight rates will be named next
year, so that the trade looks for an
advance in ore prices, at lake points,
when the new quotations are fixed."
