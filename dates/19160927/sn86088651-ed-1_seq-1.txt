PIANO IEWNGE
One of the best forms of piano insurance is to buy your piano from a reliable
local dealer. You are not only insured against the tricks of the piano agent, but you
are dealing with your friends dealing with those who are in a better position to know
your needs and circumstances you are absolutely insured against fraud.
We have had some bitter experience ourselves with piano agents. At one time
in our career we employed, what we thought an honest man, an agent to go out and
persuade people to buy pianos. He placed several pianos for us at good prices. We
ftaid him a commission of from $25.00 to $50.00 on each piano so placed. He then
eft us to go to a new field of labor. No sooner had he gone than our trouble began,
customers had been promised unreasonable things, things not in contract signed by
them and accepted by us. Being a reputable firm we had to suffer for the acts of an
unscrupulous agent No, we never will send another agent to persuade people to
buy; when you are worried to death with agents you sometimes buy before you really
should; you incur an obligation to large for your circumstances and outtt of the price
you pay the agent his big commission.
You get to see a line of real pianos; (not pictures); you get the opinion of a friend
and an honest dealer, you pay no agents commission; you get the utmost piano value.
If you should buy the wrong instrument, we will cheerfuly exchange it for you. This
is INSURANCE of the besttt kind. Insurance that saves you money when you. buy and
satisfaction afterwards.
u pianos are equal to the best Our prices are as low as the lowest and our
terms are as liberal as you need. Terms can be arranged to suit you.
