Turn for Worse: Condition is

Late this afternoon a fund
was begun for an additional re
ward for the capture of the as
sailant of Miss Olga Dahl, Round
Lake school teacher, who was as
saulted a week ago tonight. The
fund will be placed in the First
National bank and anyone de
siring to contribute can send
the money to the Editor of the

Rev. B. D. Hanscom 10.00
A. T. Carlson 10.00
It is reported that additional
reward funds will be raised at
Grand Rapids and other pomii.
Efforts will also be made to have
the governor increase the state
reward. I
A reward of $250 is offered in a
proclamation by Governor Burnquist
for information that will lead to the
arrest and conviction of the man who
attacked and twice shot Miss Olga
Dahl, rural school teacher, near her
school in Goodhope township, Itasca
county, late last Wednesday.
The money is available from a spe
cial "reward" fund of $2,000 appro
priated by the last legislature.
While the governor was having the
proclamation prepared, the following
telegram, signed by Cyrus ingK,
was received from Deer River:
"All Northern Minnesota rural folk
in dread while murderous assailant
of Olga Dahl is at large. We beg you
to offer $1,000 reward for his appre
hension. Experts sleuths necessary."
Because of the limited fund at his
disposal, Governor Burnquist decided
to let the reward stand for $250, at
least for the present. He did not in
dicate whether he had any intention
of increasing it if renewed efforts
failed to cause the capture of Miss
Dahl's assailant.
It was reported at the Henry Korpi
home Tuesday night that Miss Dahl
had taken a sudden turn for the
worse and her condition was very se
rious. No word could be received
from the Korpi home today because
of the telephone being out of order.
A man by the name of Sunberg, ar
rested Tuesday in Blackduck, was
brought to Bemidji by Deputy Sher
iffs Carson and Harris. Later he was
taken to Grand Rapids. Although it
is not believed that he had anything
to do with the Dahl case, he is be
ing held pending further investiga
tion.
He claimed that he had walked
from Cass Lake to Blackduck and
said that he had spent the biggest
part of last week in the woods. The
man was travel stained and showed
signs of long exposure The only
detail of description given by the
wounded girl not fulfilled by the man
is his shoes. He is wearing laced
shoes while the man alleged to have
assaulted the girl wore button shoes.
About 100 men are continuing the
search in the woods near the Round
Lake school today.
