a pmraiitv ot approximately ia,o"u.
State Auditor Alonzo B. Cook ap
peared to have defeated Joseph U.
lirown lor the Republican nomination
for Auditor by a plurality that prom
ised to total 10,000.

a decided upset from the standjoint of
the predictions of many Democratic
leaders who had confidently expected
bis nomination, That Mansfield would
have so complete a triumph had not
been claimed by even his own cam
paign managers. He had predicted
big support from the workingnien of
the mill cities, and in Lawrence he
received 2,576 votes, against 718 for
Cole. Iloston gave him 4,514 over

WHO KILLED COSTELLO
Mr. Clark Says That the "Yes" Voters
Did I.
F.ditor Ol The Banner: It seems
Mr. L'dltor as though such a tragedy
us lias recently come to pass in our
good t? town (if Bennington needs to
be thought through as to the reason
why.
Let's see. Who killed Costello? A
rei tain young fellow named Ketcham
admits that he killed Costello. And
yet he said that be never had harmed
any living thing in his life when be
was sober. Then. Who killed Costel
lo? Not the real man, Ketcham, but
a boast who only remotely resembcled
him.
But the business of the law Is to
get the "man higher up," the iMrtios
really responsllilo. Who turned the
Btast called Ketcham loose a week
ago Saturday niuht? Beyond doubt
the guilty parties were certain saloon
keepers of the uood town of lleniiing
ton who manufacture beasts. But
who gavo these producers of wild
beasts, the right to turn the wild
beasts loose? Sandy It was none
other than about sou. more or less,
citizens of the good town of Penning
ton, at the last March meeting. Thesi
are the real "men higher up." These
are the parties responsible for allow
nig wild iieasts or wild men to roam
and kill and tight and tear. Every
man, who voted, knew that most of
the murders were committed when
men Iwcarno beasts through liquor.
Kvery voter knew that the next vic
tim might be in lleniiington..
Next yeilr presumably Ketcham will
be sentenced to lite Imprisonment be
cause society Is too kind to kill a man
for killing u nan, He will have Q
years, perchance, to live caged as a
beast, while be shcTuld have been cag
ed only for a few short hours on that
Saturday night while he WSJ really a
beast. Siipimse the punishment
shi.uld be given to the responsible
men higher up as it should be. Let's
seo, 800 voters, each serving his
share of 10 years -It would give each
about 18 dnys. Mr. F.ditor what If
Ketcham should go free, but punish
the 800?
Very sincerely yours.
Itev. J. S. Clark.

New York, Sept. 27. The great

lice reported that only one union iiud
stopped work. This was a union jf
painters' helpers.
The men of all the big unions such
as machinists, longshoremen, masons
and bakers reported for work as astral

have a fixed agreement w ith their em
ployees will not ohey the strike order.
Fully a quarter of a million He

manv people at first took them for
strikers but it appeared later that
this is a Jewish holiday which they
were celebrating.
New York, Sept. 27. With an
noiincement by labor leaders that
lpproximately 250.0UO iinicn workers
in various trades would quit their

lieved last night tiiat the effort to tie
up virtually all industries In Greater
New York had reached an acute stage.
The union officials decleared an ad
ditional 100,000 workers would strike
tomorrow and another 100,000 Friday,
making a total of 450,000 out by the
end of the week.
Mayor stitcher, whose efforts to
settle the differences between the
striking carmen and the transit com
panles have failed repeatedly, sum
moned the labor leaders before him
yesterday. He said he desired to bt

Members of the Legislature from
New York city who called on Gov
Whitman late yesterday and urged
him to convene the Legislature In
extraordinary session to deal with tin
strike situation, submitted a draft of
a proposed arbitration act. The gov
mor, although opposed to calling the
Legislature together at this tlmt
studied the proposed law carefully and
said he believed there was "room" for
it on the statute books. The act out
lined would provide a fine of $5000
and revocation of the license of a cor
oration which breaks an agreement
to arbitrate and a fine against the
union breaking such agreement when

NEW RECORD FOR GIANTS
New York Nationals Win 21 Games in
a Row.
The Now York Nationals' double
victory over the St. Louis club In
New York Monday afternoon en
abled the (.Hants to lay claim to a
new major league record for consecu
tltre games won in one season. At the
completion of the double-header the
team had won 21 straight victories,
thus displacing the record of the fa
mous Providence Groys, who won ID
games in a row In 1884. During the
til' years since Providence set the 20-
game record the ilgures have been
threatened several times by big
league clubs, but never equaled or sur
passed until vesierdny. lu 1100 the
Chicago American league club won 19
In a stretch. The New York Nation
als ran Is straight In 1904 and 17
names earlier this season. Several
minor league clubs have exceeded
these figures, the best records being
games by the Corslcana team of
the Texas league In Wi; 25 by the
Charlotte dub of the Carolina league
in the same year, and 24 games by tho
letsev City club of the Eastern .league
In P.t:;
In a inning 21 games straight. New
York actually figured In 22 games.
since out1 game ended In a tie and was
eliminated from consideration in com
puling the winning streak. In one
respect, however, the record does not
compare with that of the Providence
club, as Pitcher Clmrley Radbourne
twirled the (iruys to victory in 18
out ot the 20 games won by his club In
the 1884 stretch of conquests.
