ASSOCIATED
PARIS, Sept. 2".?a brilliant French
attack cast of Vermandovillers lias
succeeded in capturing a strongly for
tified wood, according to an official
statement issued by the war office
Wednesday;
The capture of Combles with its
great booty completes what is regard
ed by military experts here as one of
the most brilliantly executed opera
tions of the summer campaign. The
whole front of attack from Martin
puich to the Somme has been pushed
forward uniformly for more than r
mile. Military observers declare that
the fullness of the success proves that
the Allies are masters of the situation.
Since September 15 the Germans had
brought tin three fresh divisions against
the French front and the same num
ber against the British. On the twen
tieth they made a desperate effort to
retake Bouchvesnes. Not only did
they fail but five days the British as
suming the offensive hurled back the
line despite the fact that considerable
advantages of terrain were considered
to be with the Germans.
The progress made by the French
beyond Houohavesnel is regarded here
as one of the most surprising results
of the operation. French officers
#elare that this success demonstrates
*th% growing power of the French of
fensi\e and the falling resistance of
the Germans. The hills surrounding
this village were swept on all three
sides by German artillery from St.
Pierre Vaat wood in the north of Mont
St. Quentin in the south. Neverthe
less they were stormed and the cap
ture of Hilli 130, which threatened di
rectly Allaines, paves the way for a
vigorous enveloping movement around
Mont St. Quentin and Perunno. The
newspapers compare the present of
| tensive with the bloody and futile at
' tempts of the French to break through
the German lines in Artois and Cham
pagne last year and express the great
est optimism over the present situa
tion.
All of the military writers agree
that the results of Monday's and Tues
day's fighting are among the most im
portant gained in the whole series of
battles on the Somme front. They
noint out that the recent successes
have considerable tactical value and
that, generally the situation has been
sensibly modified, a consequence, which
they say, will soon be evident.
The phrase in the official statement
from Berlin "we? are obliged to admit
the success obtained by our adver
saries" is interpreted by many news
papers as a sign that the Germans
know that the Allies arc getting the
upper hand and are trving to explain
it by declaring that the whole re
sources of the world are being used
against them. The papers exultantly
sum up the results to date of the great
offensive as fortv-four villages
190 sauare miles of territorv conquered
and 60.000 nrisonefs taken.

GRAND LEADER'S
: OPENING IS
1 POPULAR
Hundreds of Persons Are At
tracted to the Affair and
It is Big Success.
Hundreds of persons were attracted
to the successful Grand leader store
1 last night by the opening of its
cloak and BUit department. Everybody
present was delighted at the splendid
showing of fall and winter apparel.
This particular department Is under
the management of G. C. Yost, who
for six years was connocted with the
| same company's store at Marietta.
Manager H. C. Fordyce and Edward
Hawkey, manager of the Parkersburg
j store, assisted in handling the crowd
' clown stairs, while .Mr. Otto, one of the
' owners of the chain of stores, and Mr.
Yost handled the crowds upstairs.
' The decorations consisted of autumn
flowers. leaves, ferns and other green
ery and foliage were extensively used.
The music by Ketnber's orchestra was
a feature of the evening. A delightful
| lunch was served at 10 o'clock,
i C. W. Otto, senior member of the
; Ann of Otto Brothers, owners of the
store, expressed his delight with the
I reception their efforts mot. He has
spent thirty years of his life In the
mercantile business and has endeared
himself to all who know him.
; Manager Yost, of the suit depart
I ment, took pleasure in showing the
newest offerings and explained every

AUCTION STORE
Loot Consists of Watch Fobs
and Chains and a Large
Number of Cartridges.
Burglars, though by the police to
, be young boys, broXe Into and robbed
the Kaplan auction shop on West
I Pike street Tuesday night of several
i small articles, the number and value
of which have not yet been ascer
tained because of the large and
| varied stock kept on hand.
The robbery was discovered early
i Wednesday morning when clerks
opened the stors, and the police de
, partment was notified. Chief Brooks
i and Detective L. L. White went to the
scene. They found that the burglars
< had gained entrance to the shop
I through a rear door, having used an
auger to bore a hole, through which
! a hand was able to reach the lock
on the door. The auger and two
braces and bits were found near the
door.
Mr. Kaplan told the police that an
investigation showed that the burg
lars had taken a number of watch
fobs and chains, and some cartridges.
The value could not be estimated.
The police are working on the case
'and Chief Brooks said that he confi
dently expected to have the burglars
| under arrest within twenty-four
hours.

ShovOs He h
'Man Who Revolutionized Local
Sandwich Business Prom
ises to Make Repairs.
Because he didn't hove some
screens up and one or two other lit
tle things required by the hotel laws
of West Virginia. Gus Lopez, the
"hot dog" man, who conducts a little
establishment on South Fourth
street, has had the state hotel In
spector. A. D. Sees, of Huntington,
after him. Mr. Sees had Gus haled
before Magistrate William E. Starch
er late Tuesday, -where the require
ments or the state hotel laws were
explained. A fine of $5 and costs
were Imposed, but the line was re
mitted by the court upon Lopez's
promise to have the required repairs
made at once. He closed his place
Wednesday and had carpenters at
work.
Ous Is the fellow -who has pulled
the wool over'the eyes of all the res

time a big demand existed in Clarks

burg for the retailing of "hot dog"
sandwiches, in other words, weiner
worst tucked between a bun and
coated with chill sauce, mustard,
diced onions and the like. It is a
very popular and satisfying "snack"
known from one end of the country
to the other and in especial demand
in factory and university towns. Lo
cal restaurant men were Importuned
time and again to placo "hot dogs"
on sale,-J)ut they looked blank nt
the proposal and declared it was im
practicable.
Then the enterprising Gus came
along, rented a little place and began
giving the people what they wanted.
As a result his business rose by leaps
and bounds. He started out selling
1,200 to 1,300 sandwiches a day
and since his trade has more than
doubled. It is about all he can do
to supply the demand. All Gus
wants is a little more time at the
business and he will be president of

Should a porso nunacqualnted with <
I politics drop into the speakers' bu- j
? reau at Republican state headquar
1 ters here and see Morgan Owen
; poring over a larg map. placing a pin
here and another there, he would no
doubt think Mr. Owen was the chl??f j
I of staff of some belligerent army and ?
was planning a great offensive. In
one sense, his deductions would be!
correct. The map might correctly be
called a war map, and Mr. Owen him
self admits that he is planning an
offensive. But, fortunately, no
blood will be spilled. The shells
used in the artillery preparation,
preliminary to the "big pusV on
election day, will be filled with ora
tory, ix^ptead of shrapnel, and noth
ing will be injured, except the feel
ings of some Democrats.
Tact is needed in the direction of
the speakers' bureau probably more
than in any other department of a
political organization. The director
must know the political conditions
In every county of the state; must
ctor of the Speakers* Bureau at Ite
know what speaker will best All
the wants of the different sections.
Mr. Owen is a man of tact and the
state committee could not have made
a better selection than it. did when
it selected hfn to head the speakers*
bureau.
Mr. Owen was born in Summit
Hill, Pu.. and is a graduate of Dick
inson College, Pa., and West Vir
ginia University, taking law courses
at both institutions. Immediately
following his graduation from the
state university, eleven years ago.
Mr. Owen openod law ofllces at
Charleston, and his short career be
fore the bar has been a brilliant one.
Although young in years, Mr. Owen
Isold in political experience. He has,
been .actively connected with county
campaigns in Kanawha county for!
several years. He was reading clerk
of the house of delegates In 1013 and
1915 and 1" the extraordinary ses
sions. He is very aggressive, and
the Republican party is fortunate in
having him at the head of its speak
ers' bureau.
LOUCHERY ELECTED
PRESIDENT OF CL UB
At a Largely Attended Meeting
and Other Officials Are
i Also Chosen.
At a largely attended and enthUBias-|
tic meeting of the Clarksburg Young,
Men's Republican Club held In the
county Republican headquarters in the
Goff building Tuesday night, officers
for the ensuing year were elected and
other business pertaining to the club
was transacted.
The meeting was one of the best held
since the club was organized two
weeks ago. The headquarters was not
large enough to hold all the members
that turned our and many were forced j
to stand up during the meeting. The
newly-elected officers stated at the)
meeting that arrangements would be |
made this week to secure headquarters j
for the club large enough to accom
modate all the members. The mem
bership of the club has now reached'
260 and before the campaign ends it is
expected to reach the 500 mark.
The following officers were elected :|
President?Charles W. Louchery.
Vice presidents?Guy H. Burnside,
Forest McNeill, Sturgeon White, Rayj
Strother and Mark Wilson.
Secretary?James J. Cough 1 in.
Assistant secretary?W. G. Stathers.
Treasurer?Charles W. Ilibbee.
Executive committee ? John B.
Stealey and Herman Gronnemeyer.
Charles W. Louchery. the newly,
elected president, gave a short address
to the club members thanking them
for the honor bestowed upon hLm and
assuring all that he would work hard l
for the success of the club.
Following Mr. Louchery's address,
Charles D. Floyd, one of the most en
thusiastic members of the club, ad
dressed the club members. While
short Mr. Floyd's address was very
enthusiastic and showed that the club
members are not lacking in "pep" and
that good results can be looked for
from the club.
The club members were all agree
ably surprised when Joseph Holt
Gaines, state chairman, made his ap
pearance at the meeting, and when
called upon for a speech he was so
well pleased with the showing made
by the club that he addressed the
meeting. His addresB was in keeping
with the meeting, and while one of the
older Republicans of the state, Mr.
Gaines showed enough spirit and "pep"
to be classed as a member of the
young men's club. iMr. Gaines's address
was a genuine treat to all club mem
bers and If it had been known he was
to speak many of the members who
were not present surely would have
been there.

iArraignment of Rail Surrender!
Calls Forth Storm of
Approval.
CLEVELAND. O.. Sopt. 27. In
creasing the severity of his attack
against Wilsonism, Charles K.
Hughes Tuesday night, before 8,000
persons in the central armory here,
challenged the administration to deny]
that the president secretly and 11-j
legally intrigued in Mexico for the
sole purpose of unseating Huerta, a
private enemy.
He dared the president and the
president's spokesmen to repudiate
the private memorandum revealed by
John Llnd to the minister of a for-1
elgn power "that Hucrta will be put i
out if ho does not get out; that it is
the preference of the president that
It should be accomplished by do-j
mestlc means, If possible, but if It
cannot be done by domestic means, |
other means adequate for the purpose
i will be resofted to."
Arruign.s I tail Surrender.
He assailed the administration forj
wrecking an able and patriotic diplo-j
matlc service to provide Jobs for de
serving Democrat!*, and especially for
superseding Myron T. Herrlck, who
had earned the respect and admira-j
j tion of the world.
He brought Into evidence masses of i
I correspondence from the United
i States chamber of commerce to thei
president, appealing for time to get)
| at the facts before rushing through I
the Adamson bill and throwing over-j
board the whole principle of arbitra
tion In industrial disputes.
He presented, clear cut, an ar-i
rolgnment of Mr. Wilson's whole pro
cedure In the Adamson bill matter I
?as a cowardly surrender, to nvold I
| trouble, of a fundamental principle!
of democracy; as a false and tricky
attempt to win votes by pretending'
that the Adamson law was a law re
stricting the hours of labor and as
a dictatorial accusation of power over
Congress menacing to the safety of
the republic.
Hearers Htorm Approval.
These were merely a few of the
blows he aimed at Wllsonism while
8,000 Cuyahoga county folk stormed
their approval. They were seeing
and hearing Hughes at his lighting
best, a Hughes fired by the natural
development of the campaign to the
heat of earnestness and lndignatlr
and of Hughes who, while preserving
a temperate, even judicial, dignity of
] phrasing, was able to leave with them
his estimate of Mr. Wilson.
It was concerning the president's
attitude In the Adamson bill matter
that Mr. Hughes put forth most In
tensity, for it is evident, as the enm
| palgn drives on and the relative im
portance of the Issues Is weighed by
j his mind that he believes his greatest
duty to the people and his most pow
erful appeal as the Republican candi
I date turns upon the exposure of what
he considers Mr. Wilson's trickery
and usurpation of authority.
This duty is so imperative to his
mind that he insisted at Toledo, at
I noon today, In going before laboring
! men and talking straight from the
shoulder about the misrepresentation
and abuse of power practiced, as he
finds in forcing the passage of the
so-called eight-hour bill and defend
ing the need of It.
Hostile Outbreak Fizzles.
It was currently understood In To
ledo and could scarcely have failed to
be reported to Mr. Hughes that a hos
tile demonstration had been planned
' by labor Influences friendly to the ad
ministration. and that he was run- j
nlng the danger of being heckled bv
| Socialists and Democrats. At all
j events, he insisted on addressing the
laboring men and so completely held
! a crowd of 5,000 that the hostile dem
i onatration, although attempted, fiz
! zled out, suppressed obviously by a
j sense of fair dealing in the mass.
j The attempt to embarrass Mr.
I Hughes included some boos and Jeers,
some shouts for Wilson and some
questions, all arising from a certain,
| compact section of the crowd and
touching upon the .decision of the
1 supreme court In the Gompers
Mitchell contempt case that grew out
of the Danbury hatters' lockout liti
gation. The questions were put while
he was. absorbedly finishing his talk
on the Adamson bill. He did not hear
them clearly and assumed that they
came from a part of the crowd which
had not heard his Adamson bill argu
ments. The disturbance ceased swift
ly when the great body of laboring
men shouted to the Interrupters to
keep still, and the result of the whole
business was a solid round of ap
plause when Mr. Hughes finished his
talk.

7:30 a. m., and was Immediately
available t.> a local committee, whoi?e
strenuous program took no account
of an overworked throat. Mr.
Hughes, however, has become so
used to laboring at least sixteen
hours a day while good humoredly
enduring the rigors and discomforts
of travel that he was ready with the
necessary reserves of energy.
At the Boody hotel he spent two
hours receiving callers and shaking
hands with all comers, giving to most
something more than a mera hand
grip, a personal word or two, when
ever possible, for that Is the kind of
campaigning work he likes best. An
illustration of his readiness at this

mate of the reunited Republican
party as a liberal and progressive
party.
"Otherwise," he said, "I would
take no pleasure in this candidacy.
I would care naught for It."
He explained his broad gauge of
the term protection; told how he be
lieved tho United States can be 'safely
and honorably kept out of the war,
and accused the administration of
gross extravagance.
As regards the tariff, he explained
the definite commercial and In
dustrial and labor peril sure in his
mind to come at the end of the war
when perfectly organised nations be

He said he approved of a tariff com
mission, but warned his hearers that
Congress, not a commission, does the
lawmaking and that a Congress ma
jority made up of men hostile to the
protection principle could not be
trusted, no matter what a tariff com
mission reported.
