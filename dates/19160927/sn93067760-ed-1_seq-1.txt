6Mr. iichey Repeats 'That the Ipiires
slion was Created Iit his Mind That
'',There had lieen Acts of Fraud in the
lection and Ile Pelt Blound to Seek
Furllther Light.
Mr. W.. 1. Richey, .r., who stlates
that he has heard criticisi of his con
duct at the mueeting of the Stale 10xecu
tive Committe last Tuesday, has writ
ten the following letter in regard to
the nieeting:
Itiimors have colnie to lue tat I ani

itnliustly ciiticised, on account of niy
actions inl the titeeting of tfhe :it ate
Di)nocratic Execttive ('onin ittee on
Tuesday the 19th1, inst., and in fair
ness to myself I inake for pubitliention
the following statement.
Before I went into tis In eting ily
at tentiion was called to evidences of
fraud, etc., wlielh had been ipraelIced
in the Second 'ritmary election. This
evidence was in the shape of letters,
telegrams and atlldavits, and w%'ill be
published later. This ( VIdCnce Was
very strong in character and mnassiv'
in volume, and created a doubt in my
nfind as to whether or not. the election
had been fairly conducted. I presume'
every man to be honest until I am sat
isfied lie is not, and I have no concep
tion of any itan swearing falsely or
making a false atlldavit, unless I know
hii to be a rascal, and especlally so,
when I believe that he is swearing or
making atlidavit only in the interest of
fair play and without hope of remun
eration of any kilnd. Thoe cltracter of
this evidence, coupled with the honest
opinion that the lten furnishing same
were honest tmen, produced, as above
stated, the impression on toy mind that
the election was coidulcted inifair'!y at
certain places:. 'T'heli In the face of
this honsCt belief. I sk li In tIe imme oi'
commton sense and decency, coui I
ve treated myivelf fairly and cotuld I
have treated by county and state fair
ly, by sItting itlietly in miy scat with
out calling the att.ention of the com
nthe to iii; evidence of ;'raud.
I believe it a titan follows the dic
tate; of his consiience, he wsill iniva
t'lably go right. In this case I 10i
kowed the dictate: of my cons:cieice,
hnowing at the tiim I woul be criti
cised for so doing.

It is narturatl wIth some people to
forget, with others It ia a matter of
ennvetineno and to both clin'cs I want
to ask, if when two years ago, Mr.
Cooper lacked only a fow votes of get
ting into the second race for Gover
nor, some of you didn't say or believe
that Mr. Cooper was cheated out of the
second race by the same political na
chinery which I refused on the 19th,
inst., to vote with. I might be mis- t
taken, but I am almost positively sure, I
that some of the same tmen, who are I
today criticising nic for following the I
dictates of an honest conscience, ac- I
cused the same political machinery,
two years ago, of stealing second place (
in the Governor's race from Mir. Coop- t
or. I seriously doubt and venture to I
assert, that you did not have an in
filnitessimal part of the evidence I had
to base your belief on, yet we reached
the same honest. opinion, and now I am
charitable enough and was then to
Wards you, to say, that I believe 3ou1
were honest in your convictions. Then
age ia (li( not the State Executive Comn
mitt(. in 1912, when the returns show
etd t' it A1r. .Jones had been tieeiated
by \ir. Iilease, hold up Ilhe notmination
for six or seven weeks in order itha;
evidences of fr ad of Ilie saie natire
exposed by mte on the lath inst., iinight
be invesligated? I have been reliably
inforutei that. somte of those who are
condemning me loudest now, sent a1
lidkvils atlleginlg fraudc to this Comnmit
tee. 11 you will sear-(h the records,

records will s:how that tile charges
were based on the same character of
evidec(te as I intlroduc d in tile last
('oulinittce meeting. The sane records'
will show that niembers of 1911 Exce
utive Committee, "made it very plain,
Ihat the nominations for (over-nor and
other State otlicers would not. be (IC
clared, until the Committee, after a
thorough investigation, was able to
write the words "clean andl(] fair"
'croa -he nomination." (For your
convenience I cite yott to issties of The
