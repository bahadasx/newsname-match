A WORTHY CAUSE.
A union meeting at the M. E. church
Sunday night was addressed by Rev.
Charle8 Parsons of Des Moines, su
perintendent of the Iowa Society for
the Friendless.
The subject of the address was
some of the causes of failure which
land men in prison and how to pre
vent them. It was a practical dis
cussion of some of the weaknesses of
society as it exists today.
Mr. Parsons is quite familiar with
jail and prison conditions in Iowa,
and has an extended acquaintance
with the prison population. His ad
dress was based on experience rath
er than theory, which makes his con
clusions the more valuable.
One of the best) things about the
work of the Society for the Friendless
is that its workers take hold of some
of the least promising men coming
from prison andl stay by them until
they become established in useful
ness and are good citizens.
Among those under Mr. Parsons'
care on parols are men up to seven
ty years of age. The majority of these
are making good.
Supt Parsons also preached at the
Baptist church Sunday morning and
addressed Dr. Dittmer's Bible class at
the M. E. Sunday school.
On Monday he gave an address at
the High school.

METHODISTS DENOUNCE
HARDING'S RECORD
UPPEB IOWA CONFEBENCE OF
THE CHUBCH CLOSES SESSION
BY ATTACKING NOMINEE.
STRONG RESOLUTIONS WERE ADOPTED
Methodist Laymen and Ministers Go
On Record as Endorsing E. T.
Meredith for Governor*
Despite efforts of friends of Lieut.
Gov. Wt L. Harding to prevent a
vote on resolutions affecting the gu
bernatorial campaign in Iowa, the
Upper Iowa conference of the Meth
odist Episcopal church on Monday,
accepted the report of the committee
on political affairs, which denounced
the republican nominee as being the
candidate of the liquor interests.
The resolutions adopted by the
ministers in attendance at the con
ference are as follows:
"Be it resolved, That the record of
the present candidate for governor of
the republican party both as a leg
islator and as a presiding officer has
been so consistent, persistent and con
tinuous in its hostility to temperence
that there is not and never has been
any question as to where he stood on
the prohibition question.
"Because his record is well known
and undisputed we are convinced that
his election would be accepted every
where as a victory for the liquor in
terests.
"Therefore, be it resolved, That we,
as ministers of the truth, members
of the Upper Iowa annual conference
of the Methodist Episcopal church
would be traitors to our trust if we
kept silence and unworthy successors
to the prophets of old, if we did not
frankly and openly condemn the can
didacy of the nominee."
The laymen of the Upper Iowa con
ference at a meeting held last Sat
urday adopted the following resolu
tions:
"Whereas, E. T. Meredith has ta
ken a stand for prohibition and pledg
es to do all in his power to
further the suppression of the liq
uor traffic, and that his advocacy of
the cause should be supported.
"Therefore, Be it resolved, that the
laymen of the Upper Iowa Methodist
Episcopal conference should support
his candidacy for governor.
"The section referring to Harding!
read as. follows: I
Whereas It is evident that there)
is a candidate for governor whose leg
islative record clearly shows that "ne
has not been instrumental in. further
ing the cause fo prohibition, and that
we believe that his election would un
do the work of suppressing the liquor
traffic, we further urge the election
of Mr. Meredith."
BANKERS MEET HERE.

URGES VENTILATION OF SCHOOLS
SCHOLARS SHOULD ItE GIVEN
FRESH AIK.
(By A. E. Kepford.)
With the opening of the public and
parochial schools of the state the de
partment on tuberculosis of the Board
of Control, is exceedingly anxious to
impress upon teachers the importance
of the proper ventilation and sanita
tion of school rooms. Much has al
ready been accomplished by boards of
education in the reconstruction of
school buildings with a view to an
adequate antt constant supply of
fresh aid to the scholars during school
hours. Teachers very generally have
acquainted themselves with those
simple methods by which, in the ob
sence of artificial systems of ventila
tion, theyaer able to keep a supply
of good air in the school room. The
educators of the state have been giv
ing very general attention to this im
portant phase of school management,
and because of this, much is being ac
complished in the reduction of respir
atory diseases of one kin or another,
including tuberculosis. It would be
well where medical inspection in the
schools is not maintained, for par
ents to have their children thoroughly
examined with special reference to
the eyes, ear, nose, throat, teeth and
especially the chest cavity. Many phy
sipal defects ~which impair children's
health will be discovered and removed.'
This will go far toward keeping the
child well and properly adjusted to
his school tasks. It is desirable as
winter comes on that particular at
tention shall be given to the important
matter of school ventilation. Remem
ber that fresh air is necessary to good
health.
GREELEY HAS FIRE COMPANY.
Greeley has for years been without
fire protection of any kind and with
every blaze the question was brought
up as to the best means of fighting
fire in a town without the advantage
of water works. The council think
they have solved the question by the
purchase of a large chemical engine
with sufficient hose and bucket and
the organization of a volunteer com
pany who will be trained to fight fire
in a systematic way.
Monday night the volunteers met in
the city hall and organized by elec
ting J. E. Tracy, chief and W. A.
Lang, assistant. A captain will be
elected at the next meeting.—Home

OCTOBER 9TH FHtK PREVENTION
DAY.
Oie O. Roe. state fire marshal, is
urging the people, of Iowa to take
greater precaution reg^r^ing, fires
which" destroy thousands of dollars
•worth qf pro|erty each year- Mottr
day October 9th, 1916,'liiis beet^pto
claimed by the Governor of Iowa', as
fire prevention day.. The proclama
tion says in part: -v
"There were 3,810 fires report^ to
the State Fire Marshal for 1915,—more
than ten fires every day, causing a
daily loss of $16,457.00, and ..involving
daily property, worth 5^0,710.00. It
clearly appeauif thai practically one
third of these' fires were due to care
lessness. It is quite possible that
many more of them were- These at
least, should be preventible. There is
no reason why large numbers of -fire'
should be occasioned by careless
handling of matches, candles, lamps,
oil, gasoline, by bonfires, by burning
of brush ahd leaves, by defective flues,
stove-pipes, wiring, by smokers, by
