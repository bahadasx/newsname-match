Was During Aviador for (ho Entente
Allie? in France.
Winston-Salem, N. C., Sept. 23.
Kiffen Yates Rockwell, formerly of
Asheville and Atlanta, who had serv
ed in the Kreuch aero corps with dis
tinction during the long months of
lighting around Verdun, was killed in
action this morning. Announcement
Of his death was made by the
Kreuch government in a cablegram
received to-day by bis mother, Mrs.
L. A. Rockwell, of this city. No de
tails were given.
Brothers Lived in Atlanta.
(The Constitution, 24th.)
Killin Rockwell was known as ono
(,r the most daring aviators in tho
service of the allies, and had been
decorated for bis bravery. Last week
be brought down his fourth Cern?an
aeroplane. American newspapers
have carried frequent stories of his
daring raids.
For several years Rockwell was
connected with the Massengale Ad
vertising Agency in Atlanta and bad
a large circle of friends who will be
shocked to learn of his death.
His brother, 'Paul Rockwell, who
is now in Paris, also lived in Atlanta
for several years and was a reporter
on tb. Constitution.
At thc outbreak of the war In the
Tall of 1914 the Rockwell brothers
went to Krance and joined the
Kreuch foreign legion. They were
both In the trenches with Hie famous
legion during the battle of the
Marne, which turned the tide of the
invasion of Krance, and were both
wounded.
Paul Rockwell Wounded.
Paul Rockwell, in addition to be
ing wounded, became 111, and lt was
necessary for him to retire from the
military service.
Kiffin Rockwell then succeeded In
having himself transferred from the
foreign legion to the Franco-Ameri
can aviation corps. In this corps be
quickly distinguished himself and
was rapidly advanced in rank and
decorated. He was a sergeant at the
time of his death.
Kiffin Rockwell had just returned
to thc front, presumably in Fland
ers, after a visit to his brother in
Paris.
Was Baring Fighter.
Paris, Seilt. 24.-The aerial fight
in which Sergt. Kiffin Rockwell, of
Atlanta, was mortally wounded yes
terday morning by a German airman,
took place over the town of Thann.
The body of the American aviator
fell in reconquered, territory in Al
sace, near where Rockwell shot
down his first adversary five months
ago.
Rockwell was serving as a volun
teer in the Franco-American Flying
Corps on the Verdun front. A few
hours previous to the engagement he
had been promoted to the rank of ?
second lieutenant, but died without
knowing of the new honor. He al
ready had received the military
medal for shooting down a German
two-seater near Hartmanns-Wciler
kopf Li May. He bad heated down
another before Verdun and bad par
ticipated in a thrilling combat in
which nearly all the Kranco-Ameri
can flotilla was engaged with a strong
German force. He was wounded
dining that fight by a fragment of
shell while engaged alone with three
adversaries.
Sergt. Rockwell was ono of the
first American volunteers to join tho
foreign legion. lie was grievously
wounded In a bayonet attack at Ar
ras in May, 1015, before being trans
ferred to the flying corps. He was
regarded in Kreuch aviation circles
as an "ace," a name given to the
most skillful and daring pilots.
Lieut. Wm. Thaw, of Pittsburg, be
fore be was wounded, and Rockwell
made a formidable fighting pair.
They frequently were in the air
together and always chasing an ad
versary.
Rockwell had fought 34 air bat
tles since recovering from his last
wound, or an average of more than
one a day. When he met his death
lie was returning from a bombarding
expedition in which be flew one of
the fighting machines that furnished
the escort.

ZIOPPIOLINS TOOK HEAVY TOLD.
Kalil Over l Kindon Results in Two
German "Shi|?s" Wrecked.
London, Sept. 24.-Of tho twelve
big" Zeppelins which invaded tho
British Isles last night to deal death'
and destruction from the skies, two
to-day lay stark and black masses of
steel and aluminum in the little vil
lage of Mangold, Essex county. They
fell victims of the anti-aircraft de
fenses oi London and outlying dis
tricts.
. One came down a lliuning torch, as
did the Zeppelin L-21, destroyed
three weeks ago, while the second,
disabled hy gu nil re. effected a land
ing which saved the lives of the
crew, who to-night aro prisoners In
longland. The crew of the first rai
der died in the consuming Hames of
their own ship, but were not so ter
ribly charred as their predecessors.
Thousands Saw Zeppelin Burn.
The death and burning of the first
Zeppelin was witnessed by tens of
thousands of London's resident; but
the wounding and descent of th- sec
ond raider was a matter of iou hi
until to-day's oiUcial statement* were
given out. Kew details are available
of this second raider's condition, but
it ls reliably reported that the crew
surrendered to special constables.
Many who saw the shrapnel burst
ing like sky rockets about the Invad
er, which subsequently caught fire,
think there must have been several
direct hits. Many aeroplanes were
aloft and attacked the Zeppelins
from all sides.
Took Heavy Toll.
The raiders took a heavy toll of
lives before their destruction, 28
persons being killed and 99 wounded
In the metropolitan district of Lon
don. Two persons were killed, prob
ably four, and 17 wounded in the
provinces.
The property damage, while wide
ly distributed, is confined for the
most part, to small suburban dwell
ings and shops, although one railway
station was damaged, some empty
cars being destroyed and part of the
tracks torn up.
Hour of Dropping Bombs.
Tho roar of dropping bombs was
heard In many districts where the
raiders were invisible, lt ls not be
lieved that more than two or three
invading Zeppelins which crossed the
east coast succeeded in reaching the
environs of Loud n, and that two of
i hose paid tho death penalty gives
the greatest satisfaction to the mili
tary authorities. Apart from the
loss of material, the casualties of
the last two raids, it is believed, will
have a depressing effect on the Zep
pelin crews in the future.
Liquor Causes Trouble.
El Paso, Texas, Sept. 25.-A Car
ranza sergeant of the 101 Valle, Chi
huahua garrison, was- shot and kill
ed Friday night hy an American
trooper of the Fifth Cavalry, who is
being held prisoner, according to a
report brought to Columbus, N. M.,
to-day from field headquarters. The
Carranza commander at 101 Valle re
fused to surrender the prisoner af
ter Con. Pershing sent a messenger
requesting release. The American
is said to be held incommunicado on
a charge of murder.
According to the report, eight
members of the Fifth Cavalry visited
a saloon at El Valle. Seventeen Car
ranza soldiers entered later with
side arms. During the drinking, the
Mexican sergeant is said to have pro
posed a toast to the United States I
which was objected to by the Ameri
cans. Tlie shooting ls reported to
have followed.
