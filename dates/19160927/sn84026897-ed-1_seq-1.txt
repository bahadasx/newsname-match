HORN'S CREEK.
Cotton Picking Well Advanced.
Small Congregation Sunday.
Mr. and Mrs. C. A. Wells
Entertained'Friday.
The rush of cotton picking will
soon close in our neighborhood.
We are so glad that farmers are
still getting a good price for it, but
everything we have to buy is high
in proportion to cotton.
Quite a small congregation at
tended Horn's Creek last Sunday
afternoon. Those who were not
v- present do not know what a fine
sermon they missed.
On last Friday night the doors of
the home of Mr. and Mrs. C. A.
Wells were thrown open to the
young people of the neighborhood.
It was quite amusing to sea the old
time games played. These games
made the older ones who participa
ted in them feel young again. De
lightful ice cream and cake were
served. Everybody seemed to have
a jolly good time until the wee
Small hours when they reluctantly
bade their host and hostess good
night. The parlor and hall were
beautifully decorated with ferns
and other pot plants.
We wonder why Miss Sallie Mae
Miller did not attend church Sun
day. If it is not telling tales out of
school, we believe her sweetheart
called and probably his preaching
for the afternoon was more inter
esting than Dr. Jones.
' Miss Lula Roper who has been
in Albany, N. Y., for the past
three years is down on a visit to
her relatives and friends. Miss
Lula has such a big heart that she
wants to carry all of us back with
her to Albany next spring.
Mrs. Carrie Mays who has been
on a visit to Mr. and Mrs. A. A.
Wells during the past week has
J gone to the home of Dr. A. R.
Nicholson of your town.
g^*?5fiss Una' Ryan left Saturday to
??? visit ber sister, Mrs. Harmon. Mr.
Roy Ryan who had to be brought
home from Clark's Hill some time
ago on account of sickness has re
cuperated sufficiently to return to
Clark's Hill and complete harvest
ing his crop.
Mr. Warren Fair and Mrs. Pierce
Ryan are on the sick list this week,
but we hope their sickness is only
slight.
The friends andjneighbors of Mrs.
S. W. Miller are rejoiced to learn
that she has improved sufficiently
to come home from Augusta.
Mr. Lonnie Smith and children
spent Sunday with Mr. and Mrs.
James Smith.
Miss Fannie Wells of Colliers

We wish to cail the attention of
the members of the missionary so
ciety to the fact that we are invited
to meet at the home of Mrs. Lillie
Wells for our next regular meet
ing.
Mr. and Mrs. A. A. Wells, Mrs.
Jessie Crafton, Mrs. A. A. Wells

Horn's Creek.
Many Persons Killed.
Atlanta, Ga., September 20.
Death overtook 17-4 persons while
walking on tracks, swinging trains,
or otherwise trespassing on the
property of the Southern Railway
curing the year ended June 30.
Despite all warnings of its dan
ger, the practice of trespassing on
railroad property seems on the in
crease. For the three previous years
the number of trespassers killed on
the Southern was as follows: 1913
2-55; 1914-126; 1915-146, making
with 1916 a total of 601 lives sac
rificed to carelessness.
Statistics show that the great
majority of railroad trespassers kill
ed are useful citizens. Wage earn
ers, using the tracks while walking
to and from their work, furnish a
large proportion while fully a third
are school boys, killed while "hop
ping" trains.
JOHNSTON LETTER.
Andrews-Lewis Marriage. Beau
tiful Reception in Honor of
Bride. Interest in Clubs
Renewed.
Cupid is a wily little god and
often brings about many pleasant
surprises, for such was the marriage
of Miss Frances Andrews and Mr.
Archie Lewis which took place last
Tuesday evening in the home of
the bride's uncle, Mr. James White.
Rev. W. S. Brooke performed the
ceremony which was witnessed b}T
only the immediate family of the
groom and a few warm friends of
the bride. The bride was making
all arrangements to leave for Win
throp college on the evening train,
but was persuaded to discontinue
her career as a student and have the
marriage take place- The happy
pair left on the evening train for a
short wedding tour. The bride is
the daughter of Mrs. Lillie Andrews
who is now living in Tennessee but
her life with the exception of three
years has been spent in Johnston,
so her marriage is an occasion of
many happy felicitations on the
part of every one here for she is
much loved and admired. Mr. Lew
is is one of the town's most promis
ing young business men and is in
every way worthy of his bride.
With the return of the bright
and invigorating autumn days,
naturally the thoughts of club wo
men are returning to their new
planned work and study as planned
for the season and all are eager to
take this up. So the first meeting of
the New Century club which was
held on last Tuesday with Mrs. P.
N. Lott was well attended, each
pleasantly anticipating the work
and benefits derived by this fellow
ship. Mrs. H. D. Grant, president,
made a very happy and much ap
preciated short address, outlining
her policy for,.thej.eax.-JVIaeb feusi*
ness had accumulated during the
cessation of activities and with new
business the meeting was very full.
The literary session was enjoyable,
the study being "Dickens and
Tennyson," and the year books
which were given out ofter a most
delightful course. Miss Eva Rush
ton had charge of this session and
the first number was "The life of
Dickens," by Miss Alma Wood
ward; "The will of Dickens" was
read by Miss Clara Sawyer; a paper
"What is to be gained by the study
of Dicktns," was read by Miss Zena
Payne. The social half hour was
unusualhr pleasant as this was the
first meeting of these friends since
all had returned from summer trips
and vacation and while chatting the
hostess assisted by Mrs. J. A. Do
zier and Misses Ruth Harris and
Sallie Dozier served tempting fruit
jelly, whipped cream and two kinds
of cake.
Mrs. F. M. Boyd was hostess for
the "We-are-twelve club" on last
Wednesday afternoon and two very
happy hours were spent by the
members in chatting and doing fan
cy work. Sweet music was enjoyed
during the while. The hostess is a
charming entertainer and it is al
ways a pleasure to gather in her
home. A delicious repast was serv
ed.
Mrs. J. W. Marsh will go to
Gainesville, Fla., to spend a month
in the home of her mother, Mrs.
Pedrick, October 1. Her other sis
ters, Mrs. Williams of Spartanburg,
and Mrs. lsom of Florida, will join
her there and a family reunion will
be held.
Dr. Horace Wright of George
town is spending this week'here, his
wife having been here for the sum
mer months with relatives.
Prof. Staunton Lott of Batesburg
high school spent the week-end here
in his home.
The Hen-peck club which is com
posed of sixteen of the young mar
ried men of thc town met with Dr.
P. N. Kee8ee on Friday evening
and a jolly good, time was had.
They meet weekly laying aside all
care and have rook as their chief
diversion and play with a business
like manner, so different from the
lively chatter of the other club.
Duriug the latter part of the even
ing a delightful repast was served.

citement and many good wishes for 1
this school mate friend. All were 1
given cards and asked to write of \
"Just how they wanted their mar-J(
riage to be." These were read and
greatly enjoyed. Later all were in
vited into the dining room and
places were found at the table by
pretty card>-,. The centerpiece was
a large basket of marigolds and a
yellow ribbon ran from each card
to the flowers. After a tempting re
past all were asked to pull their
ribbons and each drew a bright
flower. Mrs. Lewis' ribbon was tied
to the basket which, when pulled,
emptied many pretty gifts in front
of her, these coming from the
friends about her. These were all
admired and each one was thanked
in most appreciative words for their
loving thoughtfulness.

MT. ZION NEWS.
Annual Protracted Meeting.
Pleasant Social Evtnt. Mr.
Padgett's Store Burned.
Small Insurance.
Your correspondent has been
side tracked for some time, but will
attempt now to sum up the events
of any importance which have oc
curred in our community since the
last writing.
Our protracted meeting lasted for
five days, during which time Rev.
T. H. Posey gave us some excellent
sermons. There were no additions
to the church, but conditions were
not favorable for that. For one
thing a considerable number had
come in the previous year, for an
other, the meeting had come too
late in the season, the farmer's "lay
ing by time" being over, and the
rush of the fall crop gathing being
on. The membership too was per
haps not in the best frame of mind
for a meeting, being at present
more concerned over material than
the spiritual needs of their church.
A pleasant social event for our
people was the ice cream reception
given by Mrs. W. A. Pardne, for
the benefit of the new church. This
was largely attended, much enjoyed,
and brought forth a neat sum for
the purchase of some needed arti
cles for the church.
On Monday of last week the store
owned and operated by Mr. E. M.
E. M. Padgett was destroyed by
fire. This carried a small stock of
groceries. We have learned that
there was insurance to the value of
$250 on the goods and building.
Miss Marie Padgett bas gone to
attend school at the Edisto Acade
my for the coming winter.
The sympathy of the community
is with Mrs. G. G. Pardue in the
recent loss of her sister Miss Hassel
tfne Green;
Mrs. W. A- Pardue motored to
Columbia last week to see her sister,
Mrs. F. L. Shealy.5 who had to un
dergo a surgical operation in the
Baptist hospital. She is suffering
from quite a serious affection of
throat, and a second operation will
be necessary.
We are sorry to report the con
tinued illness of Mrs. J. W. Pritch
ard. She is to be carried to a hos
pital in Augusta this week for an
operation. Her mother, Mrs. E.
J. Richardson, from Wagener, is
with her. and will accompany her
to the hospital. We hope for her
a speedy recovery, not only for her
own sake, but because we miss her
in our church and Sunday school
music.
Speaking of the Sunday school
reminds us that since the comple
tion of the new and comfortable
church building the Sunday school
will hereafter be held in it, instead
of in the building of the day school.
A large number of people living
below the church need this Sunday
school, and are already joining and
begining to attend it. We wish
for it great usefulness in the future
in its soul saving mission, for it is
one of the most important depart
ments of the work of the church.
The next meeting of our W. M.
S. will beat the home of Mrs. J.
Monroe Padgett.
Visit From Former Resident.
Mr. Charles P. Roberts of Ninety
Six, accompanied by bis sons-in
law, Messrs. T. M. and Wm. Ar
rington, motored io Edgefield Fri
day, spending the greater part of
the day here. Mr. Roberts engaged
in the mercantile business here in
1878, occupying a store that stood
about where the store of the Edge
field Mercantile Company is now
located. He is a very intelligent gen
tleman and spoke very interestingly
of old Edgefield as he knew it. Mr.
Roberts spoke in detail of some
tragic scenes which he witnessed on
the public square, in which several
men were killed. If we mistake not,
Mr. Roberts is a kinsman " of Mr.
C. M. Mellichamp.
A young married couple were at
tending a county fair in Mississippi.
Finding themselves jostled about in
the center of quite a crowd, the
husband remarked:
"I say, dearie, I think you'd bet
ter give me the lunch basket. Don't
you see, we are apt to lose each
other in the crowd."
RED OAK GROVE,
Beautiful Sunday School Exer
cises at Red Oak Grove
Church. Death of Luther
Bailey.
The exercises by onr Sunday
school yesterday was very much
enjoyed. The children acquitted
themselves very well. So well that
we feel constrained to believe we
have splendid material for devel
opment. Therefore, no time should
be denied them in trying to teach
them in every way we can. An
other feature we appreciated and
enjoyed was the willingness our
members manifested in rendering
their services, even thougn. they
may feel it a service worthless,
"Man looketh on the outward ap
pearance, but God looketb upon the
heart." We can but feel their ef
forts were not in vain. We wish
more could have enjoyed the day
with us, especially our pastor, for
our young leaders I know would
have greatly encouraged him by
their remarks, as they-did us. , At
the close of the exercises by the
school Mrs. Fannie GriHis had a
short exercise for her Sunbeams.
By our Y. W. A. girls she demon
strated the Sunbeam "tea party,"
and little Martha Timmerman sang
so sweetly the congregation seemed
almost spell-bound. Our collection
exceeded the expectation of the
school, as there were only a few
present. So we can never know what
we can do, 'till we have tried.
The Social Circle No. 2, meets
at Mrs. Sallie Tiramerman's 4th
Oct., at 4 o'clock p. m., Mrs. Allie
Timmerman leader. W. M. S. at
our last mee'.ing raised ?5.00 for
mattress for Edisto academy.
Miss Lou Eva Parkman is guest
of Miss Mamie Timmerman this
week.)
Mrs. Sam Agner and daughte
?Miss Sallie' jjaye .returned fs
Greenwood and Ninety-Six, whore
they had quite a pleasant time,,
returning home they dined on Boles
Mountain with Mr. and Mrs. J. W.
Bailey.
We wish Mr. and Mrs. McKie
Bailey every success in their new
home in Augusta. They have many
warra friends among us, who ex
tend them many good wishes.
Miss Essie Holton from Modoc
is visiting her aunt, Mrs. D. C.
Bussey
Mr. J. T. Griftis has just returned
from Greenwood, having combined
pleasure with his business to the
city. He enjoyed the privlege of a
visit to Orphanage with Mr. J. K.
Durst, who, so kindly gave him the
trip. He said the chapel exercise
was beautiful to behold, a body of
over three hundred children and alli
so bale and happy.
One pleasure of the week for us
was given by Mrs. Frank Bussey in
honor of her parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Henry Bussey of Anderson, S. 0.
Mr. Bussey talked quite interest
ingly of the splendid work done in
the Sunday school at Anderson.
Also of the Teacher Training Class
they have recently organized, led
by Prof. Watson. While the coun
try churches may not all have learn
ed and experienced leaders in their
Sunday school, it seems to me with
al the available literature and las
son helps so easily obtained we
might form a "Class" and do our
best, for that is all that is required
of anyone. I can conceive of no
way in which we could spend the
long winter evenings more profit
ably.
Our community was saddened on
yesterday by the news of the death
of Mr. Luther Bailey, in Augusta.
He was a son of Mr. J. W. Bailey
and was reared here, where he made
many warra friends. Today by the
side of his mother at Red Hill his
remains were laid to rest. Hi? pop
ularity and esteem in his adopted
home was attested by the many
beautiful floral offerings sent. Rev.
J. T. Littlejohn preached a most
beautiful fumerai sermon, using as
his subject "Remember thy Crea
tor in the days of thy youth." Mr.
Bailey was quite a young man, not
over 28 years of age. In his going
away we could but feel, that God
works in mysterious ways, his won
ders to perform. Our hearts go out
in sympathy to the family in their
sad bereavement.
