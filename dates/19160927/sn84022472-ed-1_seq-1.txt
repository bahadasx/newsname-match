"THE OUTLOOK, 287 Fourth Avenue, New York,
Office of Theodore Roosevelt,
My Dear Mr. Avis: ' ,
I earnestly wish I could be with you some Saturday in
June to greet the Progressives of the Twelfth Senatorial
District. As this is impossible I send you a letter of good
Will. ' v' , . , i " i(
The Progressive party stands to-day "precisely where
the Republican party stood in the days of Lincoln,-when it
was the progressive party of the nation. It is as idle to
talk of our amalgamating with either of the old party ma
chines as it would have been to talk of the Lincoln Repub
licans amalgamating either with the Bourbon Democrats
or the Cotton Whigs of their day. We stand absolutely
for our platform ; we believe in, applying the principles
of that platform to papy management as well as to the
government. There isno. place in our ranks for theboss,
for the man who represents the alliance between privi
lege in business and privilege in politics. I firmly believe
that there are literally millions of progressives among the
rank and file both of the Republican and Democratic par-.
xjies, and that these men will sooner, or later realize that
they can do nothing where they are, and the only way they
can efficiently fight for social and industrial justice,for po
litical and economic freedom, for equality of opportunity,
is by joining the Progressive party. . They shall have ex- .
act equality of treatment with us without regard to wheth
er, they are ex4emocrats or ex-Republicans. We wel
come all honest citizens to our ranks. " , ' '

Graveur, she also told the police, had
been very friendly with Mrs. Bel

Shortly afterwards, guests on the
same floor were startling by four shots
and rushing into the hallway they met
the woman, who is about 23 years
old, staggering from her room with a
bullet wound in her breast ;
' She was screaming hysterically and
it was impossible to secure a coher

found dead in one corner of his room
and Mrs. Belzer, clutching the still
smoking revolver in her hand, in an
other. .
How Mrs. Belzer gained entrance
to the apartments occupied by her
victims is not known. Neither has it
been established' from whence she
came. The police theory, however, is
that she had followed Graveurs to this
city from New York. Mrs. Belzer
was about 25 years old.
The police learned from a woman
guest at the hotel that Mrs. Belzer
waited a long while in the hotel cor
ridor last night for Graveur and his
supposed wife to return. Mrs. Belzer
told this woman guest that she was
Graveur's wife, that she had no key
to get into, her room and that she was
tired of waiting.

Jewish Holiday Complicates
Work of Estimating Num
ber Now Out.
New York, Sept 27 The general
strike of labor unions in sympathy
with thevstriking street car men was
supposed t9 be effective today and,
although labor leaders claimed that
some 250,000 workers had responded
to the call, there was little evidence
that a strike was in progress.
Private canvassers among the labor
unions reported that at least 22 had
failed to respond to strike calls this
forenoon. .. The only report received at
bers of the painters had refused to
police headquarters was that 250 mem
report for work.
Among the unions which were ex
pected to go out today but did not was
the brewery workers, numbering 6,000.
Their leaders declared they would
surely strike tomorrow. '
Attempts to estimate the number of
strikers were complicated toy the fact
-that thousands of Jewish workers will
remain idle over Thursday and Friday,
in celebration of the beginning of the
Jewish New Year. Of the 200,000 ex
pected toy the leaders to strike, 143,000
are members affiliated with the united
Hebrew trades who stop work each
year at "this time for the Jewish hol
idays. Among the organizaztions which
have voted to strike today, according"
to those directing thejmovement, are
A
Ladies' ' Garment . workers, 95,000;
clothing workers, 40,000; painters and
decorators, 15,000; furriers, 15,000; tin
smiths, 10,000; butchers, 10,000; station
ary firemen, 2,500; paper jox makers,
7,000; milliners, 6,000; jewelry workers,
8,000; brewery wdrkers, 6,000; total,
209,rm '
The leaders asserted that in addition
to those who quit work today they
would be able to call out 100,000 mors
daily for the next two or three days.
At the last moment it became known
that T. V. O'Connor, national president
of the Xongshoremen's Union, had de
cided not to call out the 45,000 mem
bers of that organization today. It
was stated that there was serious
doubt whether he wouldv ask them t
take part in the strike at any time.
The joint labor conference committee
directing the strike met this morning
to hear the reports of the unions whose
members had responded to the strike
call. s '

Many Allegations of High Finance, to the Detri-,
ment of Poor Depositors of Bankrupt Bank,
Are Made in Document, Filed With Vermont
Judge of United States District Court Cham
berlain's Connection With Georgia Loan &:
Trust Co. and Watervliet Hydraulic Cosi
Financing Reviewed in Petition Which Al
leges That Large Sums Due the Bankrupt
; Firm Are Due to Creditors.
Many sensational allegations, basea upon "information. and.
belief" of high financing of the affairs of the now bankrupt !
banking house of Burr & Knapp, are made against Attorney John;
C. Chamberlain, the trustee for the firm, in an application made i
to the United, States district court, for the removed of Chamber-'
lain as trustee of Burr & Knapp's estate. ,
The creditors who have signed the petition are Adolph1
Sherman, Signe Sherman, Lockwood & Nichols and Danier M
Nichols. All these hold claims against the bankrupt estate, an A'
their claims have been allowed in the United States district'
court. : ,
The proceeding which aims to remove Chamberlain fr6m
further connection with the bankrupt firm has been guaded
with utmost secrecy. It was filed with Harland B. Howe United
States district judge, of Vermont.
At a session of the court,
Chamberlain, trustee of the estate of Mary H. Burrand H. M.
Knapp, co-partners, bankrupt, under the firm name of iBunv &
Knapp, was notified to appear in the court house at NewHaveii,
yesterday, at 10:30 a. m., to show cause why he should notibfiH
removed. '
Service for Chamberlain, who at tfye time wasabsentifrom
the city, was accepted by Elbert O. Hull, his law partner, and
it is understood that Canfield & Pullman will represent him. i
Although the papers were in the court yesterday, neither side
entered an appearance, and no action, so far has beenitaken, the i
case having been held in abeyance by the court ' 1
While the document is based largely
upon the facts brought out at the var
ious hearings in connection with the
failure of the hanking house, there
are many sensational allegations of
high finance thjit in view of recent
events are highly Interesting to the
money through the bank's failure,
money through theb ank's failure.
It is asserted that the creditors are
moved to ask for Chamberlain's re
moval on many grounds. One of these
is the' fact that Chamberlain through
manipulation of notes has reduced his
own liability on funds which should
be included in the bank's assets.
It is further set forth that the sale
of the rent and mortgage business of
the defunct firm was affected by
Chamberlain in such a manner that
the Title Guaranty & Trust Co. bought
it for a small part of its real value.
It is represented first, that:
On or about the 16th day of No
vember, 1914, a creditors meeting was
lield for the purpose of electing a trus
tee in bankruptcy.
That John C. Chamberlain was one
of the nominees for such position, but
opposition to him ! had developed,
largely because of a belief on the part
of many of the creditors that he had
been the attorney for the bankrupt ror
a number of years.
That at the hearing,. John C. Cham
berlain addressed the creditors, rep
resenting that ne naa in no way
been connnected as attorney with the
firm of Burr & Knapp, or' with said
Herbert Knapp or Mary E. Burr, ex
cept that his law firm had foreclosed
morta gages for said firm of Burr &
Knapp and that his appointment was
necessary to protect the Interests or
the creditors.
That such statements were In fact
untrue and were made for the purpose
of securing his election as trustee and
permitting of the acts hereinafter re
ferred to.
Note for $10,000
A second allegation asserts:
That on or about the twenty-fourth
day of August, 1914. Herbert M.Knapp
knowing that the firm was in failing
crcumstancea, sent for John C. Cham
berlain and informed him that ne
mast raise $10,000 that day or the
firm of Burr & Knapp would be closed
up by the First-Bridgeport National
Bank, to which it was Indebted in a
large sum of money. s
That John O. Chamberlain, Having
stated to Herbert M. Knapp that ne
did not have such a large sum of
money available, Herbert M. Knapp
stated that the said First-Bridgeport
National bank would accept in place
of the $10,000. a ote which Hervey
E. Burr, the son of Mary B. Burr.
would draw to the order of Burr &
Knapp, if Said John C. . Chamberlain
would endorse it. and, that this would
prevent the bank from taking steps
to throw the firm of Burr & Knapp
into a receivership,
That John O, Chamberlain 'agreed
to do this, provided he was secured
against loss thereby and It was then
agreed between John C, Chamberlain
and Herbert M. Knapp that a tract of
land known as "Fair View Lawn."
which was held by Hervey E. Burr,
as trustee for Burr & Knapp, should
be mortgaged to secure John C. Cham
berlain against less from endorsement,
the mortgage to be made to John O.
Chamberlain,
That John C. Chaintoerlaln endors
ed the note for $10,600, drawn by
Hervey E. Burr, in favor of Burr &
Knapp, on the 86th day of August,
1914, and the mortgage as stated, was
thereupon, given to John O, Cham
