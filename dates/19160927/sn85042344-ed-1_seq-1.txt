Tho break which has become more
apparent daily between the mayor and
cltv commissioners on one side and
the Jitney operators on tne otner was
tho subject of a lengthy discussion at
yesterday's city commissioners meet
ing, and as In the pust, resulted In
no definite ordinance being drafted
and the deferring of the matter until
another date when it is hoped a soiU'
tlon may bo reached.
"It looks liko tho agitation is go
in to hamr on until the city com
mlssloners got sore and put through
their radical ordinance," aald an at
tache of one of tho offices yesterday.
"Te mayor and the commissioners
have agreed to ifWa the Jitney opera
tors the privilege o operating their
flvo-uussonger curs with a load limit
of seven, or two In excess of the sched
uled load. The jitney men want to
haul ten, wr twlco the number sched
uled as a load. It Is here that tho
difficulty has come and until an
ugrecment is reached here on this
nolnt or until tne commissioners nine
the matter Into their own bunas, tne
plan will hung fire.
The city nail employe wnu iuiub
this Btatement hud sat througn every
meeting of the commissioners when
this matter had been discussed. He
is well Informed as to now tne com
missioners stand. Ho continued :'The
mityor and commlssoncrs are getting
tired of the quarrel, tney navo tne
sole right to make any ordinance iney
seo fit and there is no appeal. It will
tuko but one or two more long tire
some meetings liko the one of Tues
day morning to get them In a humor
not to discuss the matter further and
then they will make tne law to sun
ihAtnsclvns. without reference to the
wishes of those who it will affect."
The mayor and commissioners at
yesterday morning's meeting had but
little time after tho "Jitney discussion"
to go Into other matters aside from
giving a short time to learning more
of the plan to erect a municipal In
cenerator, whoreby, according t
those Informed In the matter, the city
will derive several hundred dollars In
revenue annually from the sale of
by-products, such as bones, hides,
oils and fats.
It Is probable that the Jitney ordi
nance will be comploted and ordered
printed as a city law at the next meet
ing of tho commlsatonorji on Friday
morning.
