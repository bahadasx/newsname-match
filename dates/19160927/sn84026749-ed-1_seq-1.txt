LONDON, Sept. 27. The Brit

the Somme front. Patrol detach-

' General Haig reported this after
noon.
In two days of the great battle
on the Somme front, 'the British
alone have captured between 3,000
and 4,000 prisoners.
PARIS, Sept. 27. Rolled back
by the tremendous allied blow yes
terday, the Germans made no at
tempt to recapture positions taken
by the French north of the Somme
last night, it was officially an
nounced today. The French spent
the night organizing their new posi

The most successful blow struck by
Anglo-French troops since the battle
of the Marne has brought the capture
of Peronne and Bapaume appreciably
nearer.
It 'Is possible, military critics said
today, that both these towns, the Im
mediate objectives or tho great allied
offensive, will fall within a fortnight.
The apparent ease with which German
resistance collapsed at Thlepval yes
terday, following the capture of Com
bles, surprised military observers here
and led them to predict quick victories
for the British and French In the
drives on Peronno and Bapaume.
A large number of German prison

Somme front as the result of yester

Germans Die at Guns.
The final dash against Combles de

fighting of the whole war. The Ger
mans, caught tn the southwestern
angle of the village, stuck to their
machine guns bravely, and died at
their posts. The French, advancing
through the cemetery on the south-
east, were repeatedly counterat

certain death.

By ROBERT J. BENDER.
A8BURY PARK! N. J.. Sept. 17.
"Punitive expeditions" Into the Cen
tral West In October, were today be
ing worked out in detail by President
Wilson. Development of his plana for
this series of trips alUlmportant
from 'a political standpoint Includes
decision as to the nature of the ad
dresses he will make, and the num
ber. On both these points, the President
Is receiving tremendous amount of
advice dally. As a result, he has
summoned his campaign general,
Vance McCormick, for a conference
at Shadow Lawn late today.
In the first place the Democratic
leaders want the President to "Vet
Into the game" with Hughes and land
on a number of Issues the Republican
candidate Is now striving to put over
the plate.
While the leadera agree with the
President that he should not ko out
on a stumping tour, they are more and
morr outspoken in urjflng" the injec
tion or a few more personalities into
the so-called "discussion of public
questions", to whlchUhe President has
said he wished to limit himself.
These leadera wish to see the Itenub
Jlcan.vpaaty. and Hughes himself. If
possioie, piaqeu on ine'gnnaie oy t-resi-dent
Wilson and made to answer what
both would have done In the situations
confronting the Administration during
the last three and a half years.
As for the number of speeches he
will make, that's another troublesome
question for the President. He plana to
speaK at mgni in umana, uctoDer &;
In the afternoon at Indianapolis, Oc
tober 13, and probably In the afternoon
in Chicago, October 19.
En route to these cities the President
will cover hundreds of miles, pass
through scores of towns and cities, and
either sneak to or nass uu thousands
who will naturally be on hand to see
mm ai me stations.
Many of his lieutenants want him to
make platform speeches. The President,
however, believes if he did this on a
general plan, his trips might be classi
fied as stumping tours.
