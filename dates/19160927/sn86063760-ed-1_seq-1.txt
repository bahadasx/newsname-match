BRITISH PROPOSE MORE
STRINGENT SHIPPING CONTROL
Claim Depletion of Supply of Ton
nage as Result of Submarine Actior
Must Be Met by Increased Measures
London.-The continued depletion
of the world's supply of tonnage as a
result of the operations of the sub
marines of the Central Powers wil
be met by an increase in stringent
measures by which the Entente Al
lies design to control shipping, so as
to ensure It being used to the bes
advantage of the Allies and prevent
it even indirectly aiding their oppon
ents. according to a statement 'made
to the Associated Press by Lord
Robert Cecil, Minister of War Trade
Lord Robert admitted that even the
present rate of destruction without
considering the possibiliy of a re
sumption of unrestricted submarine
warfare. meant a serious loss to the
world's tonnage and that consequent
ly it would not be expected that
British coal or cther British facil
ities should be expended on ships
carrying goods to blacklisted firms
The Entente Allies will increase their
shipping measures, which already are
proving valuable in making the besi
use of available tonnage in propor
tion as the Germans succeed in de
stroying merchant ships.

LIGHT DRAGOONS
VERY EFFICIENT
ONE OF THE BEST CAVALRY OR
GANIZATIONS ON THE BOR
DER-YOUNGEST COLONEL.
NEWS FROM BORDER CAMP
A Weekly Letter, Prepared Especially
For Our Readers, From the South
Carolina Guardsmen Encamped at
Fort Bliss, Texas.
In Camp with the South Carolina
Brigade, in the El Paso Patrol District.
The Charleston Light Dragoons are
rapidly becoming one of the best train
ed cavalry organizations on the bor
der. In a recent test by army officers
the Dragoons came out with a score
of 10u per cent in appearance and care
of equipment, got second place in prog
ress and equitation, and third in bit
b ting and saddling. So noticeable is
the progress which the Dragoons are
making that the Massachusetts offi
cers. a squadron of whose cavalry is
in the provisional regiment with the I
Dragoons. have complimented the Pal
metto horsemen highly. One of the
Bay State newspaper men said to this
correspondent that the officers of his
state had praised the Dragoons and
one of their leaders predicted that the t
South Carolinians would soon have an
efficient and well trained group of
cavalrymen as there is on the border.
The Dragoons went into a provi
sional regiment along with a squadron I
of cavalry from Rhode Island and a
squadron from Massachusetts and both
of these had been on the border sev
eral weeks before the Palmetto boys
arived, and yet in the inspection the
Palmetto boys showed up in the front
ranks with the horsemen from the
other states. The Bay State people
praise especially the personnel of the
South Carolina organization and fore
' see an ideal cavalry troops after a few
weeks' training on the border.
Always at Work.
The Dragoons are working from
5:30 a. m. until 6 p. m., and even
after that hour the officers and non
commissioned officers are busy study
ing the various problems laid out for
them and brushing up on military
lore.
The Dragoons in company with the
other troops of their regiment are
having troop training this week and
are undergoing troop tests. They are
having daily trafning -in equitation.
troop drill and short marches. A com
plete field inspection of the regiment r
of cavalry took place on Saturday,
the men and horses having complete
marching equipment.
The first regimental review and pa- C
rade took place on last Friday after
nono. Without previous intimation
the call for regimental parade and re
view went forth and the Dragoons
were right on the job. The regiment
al drill lasted four hours, under Col.
Hornbrook -the commander.
The Dragoons had to excavate two
feet before beginning to build their
mess ha.11. They began on this mess
fa11 21 days after the other cavalry
organizations but completed their mess
along with the rest.i
The officers of the provisional cay
alry regiment are having daily les
sons in courtmartial work. Capt. W.
Manning of the Dragoons has been
appointed inspector for the regiment
in the courtmnartial work.
The officers of the Eighth and Sev-'
eteenth regiments had an obstacle
ride, to which the officers of the Dra
goons were invited and attended.
The Dragoons have a frying size'
"dominecker" rooster which they I
broaght along with them from South
Carolina. The rooster was the gift of 1
a negro man who worked around the
mobilization ground, It was his sign of
appreciation for several extra meals
from the Dragoon's kitchen. ThIsI
rooster walks around the Dragoons'
tents very much at home and every
night walks up to the kitchen for the
company cook to put him to bed. He
is thriving on the plains of Texas and
-gives promise of growing into a vigor
-ous fowl if not captured by ma
rauders.
Col. B. M. Blythe of the First was
a visitor to Clouderoft, New Mexico,
on Sunday. This is the garden of
the West, being 10.000 feet above the
sea, and its fame and beauty attract j
visitors from all over the country.
W. A. Horner of the Navy Y. M. C.
A. of San Francisco spoke sto the men
of the Palmetto regiments on Sunday
night. An open air stand was erected
Ibetween the regiments and four big
gasoline torches lighted up the space
sufficiently for everybody to read. The
Secon?d regiment band furnished the
raaic. Mr. Horner spoke on religion
as applied to a soldier's life. His talk
was much enjoyed and was the firs?
of several which will be put on by H. I
-P. Demand in charge of the Y. M. C.
A. here.
Baseball games between the compa
nies of .the Second regiment began
-this afternoon and will continue six
weeks. Two games will be played
-each afternoon. The schedule was
-arranged by Lieut. Ortmann of the
German F'usileers, Sergt. Kaiser of
Company H, and H. P. Demand of
the Y. M1. C. A.
Fotball practice will begin on Fri
day. It is hoped to work out an alt
tar regimental team to challenge th
Pennsylvanians. There are several
-former varsity men in both of the Pal
metto regiments and it is felt that it
will not be any trouble to turn out a
winning football team.
The big Y. M. C. A. tent, which was
-so popular at Styx, has been telegraph
ed for and should reach the border by
-the end of this week. The tent will
be erected between the two regiments.
Mr. Demand yesterday moved his pres
ent small tent up in front of the two
Sregiments. The boys have already
'taken out all the two cases of books
and used up 15,000 sheets of writing'
paper. More has been orderd.
,6000 magazines are being passed s
around from one to anothor and are
proving a treat for the soldiers.
Fifty sets of checkers and dominoes
which were brought out by Mr. De
nand are being used extensively. The
men are thoroughly appreciative of 1
..ie benefits of the Y. M. C. A. and are
itilizing it to the fullest extent.

The first Community F'air Clarendon

hapel Home Demonstration Club, and
coved a decided success.
Tt was a revelation to the Commun

telligent mitnagement of the dairy,
multry and barn yard, really mean to

Pleasant weather, a-concourse of hap

Pleasing and instructive talks were
ade by District Agent, C. A. Mc

versified farming, urging this as a

bject, poultry and eggs, and gave
me valuable hints to poultry raisers

Seats were placed and a table spread
