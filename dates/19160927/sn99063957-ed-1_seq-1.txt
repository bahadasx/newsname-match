Berlin Admits Losses and Says There Is No Cessation of
the Furious Fightng On the Line Around Combles British
Take Nearly 4,000 Prisoners Greece Facing Revolution
Believed Ready to Join Forces With Allies
By Ed L. Keen,
(Unied Press Staff Correspondent.)
London, Sept. 27. Without a moment's ; breathing
space, the allies are pushing their great offensive on the
Somme front with renewed vigor, following the capture
. of Thiepval and Combles. .
The German war office this afternoon admitted the
loss of Thiepval and reported that the British have
pushed forward on both sides of Courcelette, after suf
fering heavy losses. The Berlin statement reported no
cessation in the furious fighting on the line that once
rested on Combles. The allies continued on the attack
last night but on this sector, as well as south of the Som
me all Anglo-French onslaughts were repulsed, the Ger
man war office claimed.
y General Haig's afternoon report emphasized the fact
that there has been no lull in the fighting. Advancing
nearer to Bapaume, the British made progress last night
in the direction of Eaucourt-L'Abbaye, less than three
miles from Bapaume. The British alone took from 3,000
to 4,000 prisoners in Monday and Tuesday's fighting.
Germans Fight Heroically.
London, Sept. 27. The most success
ful blow struck by Anglo-French troops
hi lie o the battle of the Munie brought
the capture of Peronna Mid Bapaume
appreciably nearer.
It is possible, English military critics
nid today, that both these towns, the
immediate objectives of tho great 0i
lied offensive, will fall within a fort
night. The apparent ease with which
German resistance collapsed nt Thiepval
yesterday following the capture of forn
ixes surprised military observers here
and led them to predict quick victories
tor the British and French in the drives
on Peroime and Bapaume.
A large number of German prisoners
have been brought in all nlong the Som
me front as the result of yesterday's
successful operations. At Combles group
after group of Germans was cut off and
cornered between British and French de
tichinents closing in upon the village.
They fought desperately from " under
ground caverns until they were silenced
by bombing parties.
1 lie tinal dash against C ombles devel
oped into some of the most savage fight
ing of tho whole war." The Germans
aught in the 'southwestern angle of
the village stuck to their machine guns
l..-iv.L- o.l rli,l if tlnt'if fmdta Tli.
French advancing through the ceme
tery on the northeast were repeatedly
counter attacked by Teuton detach
ments that stormed their lines in the
ticc of certain deutli ,
The few Germans who escaped re
treated hastily toward Snilly, fulling
back a distance of more than two miles.
Details of tho capture of Thiepval
fire still lacking. The Thiepval posi
tion, fortified perhaps more strongly
than any village on the Summo line,
IimI held up the advance of the British
left wing since the opening day of the
allied offensive. It fumbled in under
one sudden smash that sent the Germans
ro'ling upon Grndiecourt. '
Greece May Join Allies.
London, Sept. 27. Wholesale defec
tions from the Greek nrmy were report

Took Many Prisoners.
London, Sept. 27. In the two days
of the great battle on the Somme front,
the British alone have captured between
3,000 and 4,000 prisoners, General Haig
reported this afternoon.
The British have gained new position

j patch from Rome this afternoon report

further indication that Greece may be
preparing for an early declaration of

Infatuated Woman Kills Man,
and Woman Posing As
His Wife
Philadelphia, Sept. 27. Death wrote
finis across a story of the mad infat
uation of a woman for a man who lov
ed another, when Mrs. Harry Belzar,
310 Euclid avenue, Brooklyn shot to
death ,T. C. Grnvicr New York garage
president, probably fatally wounded a
woman who posed ns his wife and then
committed suicide in a room in tho Ho-'
tel Walton hero early today.
The mystery that had surrounded the
tragedy was partially cleared shortly
before noon when Mrs. Frances Apinan,
sister of the dead man, and Howard
Fancey, his partner, arrived here and
correctly identified the bodies. The
slayer went under the alias of Mrs. J.
C. Ladur and gave her address as 10
west 120th street New York.
The identity of the "other woman"
now believed to be dying in Jefferson
hospitnl, however, remains a mystery.
Mrs, Apmau and Fancey denied that
she was Clravier's wife.
His real wife died J.wo years ago,
they said and detectives are directing
their efforts towards learning who tlie
dying woman is. It is believed she
comes of a wenlthy New York family,
like Mrs. Belzar, was infatuated with
Grnvicr.
Magistrate Peisch with two police
men nie waiting at her bedside in hopes
of getting some statement before her
lips are forever sealed. Only once did
she regain consciousness. Then she was
informed of her-condition and asked to
make an nntc-morten statement.
A wan smile flitted across her mouth
an instant, she sighed and said:
"Please, please ga away. I am so
tired. Don't bother me," and lapsed
into unconsciousness.
For two years, according to Mrs. Ap
nian and Fancey, Mis. l?elzar has fol
lowed Gravier. She was infatuated
with him and repeatedly he spnrnJd her
love. Finally she became desperate
anil followed him every plnee he went.
Mrs. Belzar Whs handsomely gowned
and seemed to be always well supplied
with money. ...
Sue arrived in Philadelphia Monday.
She visited all of the larger hotels,
telling clerks she was in search of her
husband.
Gravier and his companion did not
register until yesterday at the Walton.
Last night Mrs. Belzar hnd no trouble
in going to their rooms. A matron saw
her waiting in the hall, and asked her
what she wanted.
"I am waiting for my '"udmnd," she
replied.
Guests in other rooms heard no words
Only the opening of a door, four sharp
reports and then a woman's scream.
The bodies of Mrs. Belzar nnd Gravier
were in the room, while the "wife"
was crawling down tho hall.
Prices Moved Upward On
Million Share Market
New York, Sept. 27. The New York
Evening Hun finnnciul review today
says:
In the grealer part of today's ses
sion prices worked toward higher
levels with mnrked improvement in the
railroad shares, which moved under
the influence of buying by commission
houses for public account and cover
ing by professional traders who ap
parently were encouraged to change
their position by the excellent char
octer of the business nnd the evident
intention of the larger Wall Street in
terests to support an upward move
ment in the group. In several in
stances not only among the rails, but
in other parts of tho market as well,
new high records were established. Al
though the total dealings again was In
excess of 1.000,000 shares, making the
l.Hth consecutive million share day, the
speculation at all times wnsorderly.
Stock continued to be taken out of
the market by cash buyers. The de
mand for money was relatively inac
tive, while on the floor of the stock
exchange funds were offered in abund
ance under 2 1-2 per cent, a most un
usual exhibition of easy loan rates in
a time of great stock market turn
overs. Stocks offered were easily ab
sorbed, and the declines which de
veloped at times represented little be
yond speculative adjustments incident
to a bull market.
LABOR UNIONS HOT
RESPONDING TO
CALL FOR STRIKE
200,000 Remain Away From
Work It Being a Jewish
Holiday
PAINTERS ONLY ONES
WHO OBEY STRIKE ORDER
Leaders Say More Organ
izations Will Order Strike
Today
New York, Sept. 27. Labor unions
in New York were today standing by
contracts they have with employers, and
there wag little response to the call for
a general walkout . in sympathy with
the striking employes of the traction
lines.
Police reports up to 11 o'clock ac
counted for only one local, connected
with the painters' union, going out as
an actual step in the sympathetic move
ment. Probably 200,000 union workers
remained away from work today, but a
majority of them would not have re
ported had there been no strike call,
being Jewish and observing the an
nual holiday of their faith.
Tho longshoremen, stevedores and
other workers who were expected to be
among the first to respond, Teported
as usual today. All indications were
that unions having contracts were
showing little sentiment in favor of a
strike.
The labor leader expressed them
selves ns entirely satisfied with the
situation today, but would make no es
timate of the number on strike, or about
to strike. - . v
Expect 100,000 Tomorrow,
New York, Sept. 27. The general
strike, designed to call out all organ
ized labor in New York City in sup
port of the striking carmen, was sched
uled to become effective today
It was generally admitted, however,
that the exact number who tuny re
spond to the call cannot be definitely
estimated, owing to the largo number
awny from work because of the Jewish
holidays, which start tonight.
Outsido figures showed that about
,100,000 workers might be absent today,
but a majority of these were of the He
brew trades out in preparing for New
Year.
No general walkout by union men
throughout the city wns apparent and
the industrial life of New York is ap
parently in no immediate danger of
paralysis.
Labor leaders predict that 100,000
union workers will be ndded each
morning to those on strike until the
suspensionof work brings about victory
in approximately IS hours.
Mnny of tho unions have deferred ac
tion until tomorrow or the first of next
week, while officials of a few locals
weic declaring definitely for the sym
pathetic strike.
The longshoremen, who were expected
to give the greatest support to the strik
ing carmen, have decided not to strike
just now. The tide water boatmen, the
coopers and the steamwinch engineers
nlso postponed action, so the harbor is
not tied up. '
Only one union so far has gone out
in syniputhry with the striking carmcu,
according to the best police information
early today. Painters union struck und
was the first to walk out.
President O'Connor of the longshore
men's union, who less than n week ago
declared, "you can het vour life there
will be a sympathetic strike," left for
Washington, stating that he hail not
ordered a strike for today nnd refused
to comment further.
Mayor Mitchell and Governor Whit
mnn are not taking any definite action
todav regarding the strike no far as is
"known. The mayor called into confer
ence Hugh Frayne, organizer of the
American federation of Labor nnd ask
ed him what he expected to have hap
pen. Frayne replied thot they expected
200,000 men to go out "as a starter."

Wall, age J.'l, is dead oml her II year
old brother is dying today as the re
sult of their father's attempt to cross
the Southern Pacific tracks in front
of an electric train near Berkeley.
Wall nnd his wife were nearly pros
trated with grief today as n result of
the accident. Wall said when he sow
the train coming he impulsively de
cided to try to bent it to the crossing.
He speeded lip bis machine and was
squarely on the tracks when the train
struck him. The automobile was hurl
ed more than loo feet. The little girl
was i list an 1 1 v killed and the bov suf
fered internal injuries. Wall himself
received sever bruises.
Japan's foreign trade last year was
unprecedented, as It showed a big lull

FORD TELLS WHY

WILSON CAN DO MORE FOR
COUNTRY THAN ANY ONE
Says He Has Had Eight-Hour
Day Three Years and
i Gained By It
Detroit, Mich., Sept. 27. Henry
Ford announced his reasons for support
ing President Wilson in a statement
mndo public today. 1
"I'm for Wilson," said Ford, "be
cause he is on to the interests the
'unseen hands that seek to control gov
ernment ami is Heading tnem off.
That he is on to them and is heading
them off, !b proven by his refusal to
rush into war with Mexico, sacrificing
the lives of thousands of young Amer
icans to save the dollars that Wall
street has invested in Mexico on a gam
ine.
"But for uurelv business reasons.
which may appeal mo'e directly to many
men, ine weirare or the country de
mands Wilson's re-election. The repub
licans are raising a great roar about
the eight hour law and how it will ham
per business I sav ami I mv from
experience, not from guess work that
tne eight hour law will help business.
Businessmen and employers who are hos
tile to the eight hour day do not know
their business. ,
"We have had the eight hour day in
fore: in the Ford factory for three year
and we have made more money each suc
ceeding year under it. It has proved its
own merit.
"The business of the United States
today has a momentum that no man or
group of men ean stop. As for the
tariff, which the republicans insist must
be revised to help save our prosperity
after the war I want to say that the
tariff is nothing but a hothouse rem
edy. It may make business sprout 'for
a littlo while but its effect is artificial
and it. never enn produce a hardy, busi
ness piant.
"I know Hughes. Teddv nnd Wall
street are behind him. I'm a republi
can, but I'm for Wilson. I'm a repub
lican tor tne same reason l have ears
I was bom that way. But. I'm for Wil
son because I believe he can do more
to enhance the prosperity and assure
peace for this nation, than any other
candidate. Any one who does not want
peace and who wants to gamble with
prosperity should vote against him."
