New Tavern's Manager
F. W. Leonard, formerlj milliliter
of the .Sexton Hotel in Kunas City,
who will lie manager of the 'cvt
Diiriel ltoouc Taiern.
SEW HOTEL WORK PROGRESSING
Most Diltieult Part of Construction
is Over, Sajs Superintendent.
With forty cr fifty men working
daily, the construction of the new
Daniel Boone Tavern is progressing.
The concrete walls of the basement,
the concrete and tile floors for the
first story and the concrete structure
for the mezzanine and balcony have
been completed-
"The most difficult part of building
the structure is now past," said A. M.
Rhoades, general superintendent, yes
terday. "The concrete work of the
basement and first floor is the most
particular part of the entire job, as
a slight deviation from exact measure
ments in this part of the concrete
work would mean a serious setback
later on. .
"The molds for the second floor
structure are being completed today,
and much better time will bo made
in the work from now on. We expect
to finish at least one story of the
structural wcrk each week."
Three carloads of lumber were usel
in making the molds for the concrete
in the basement and .first floor. The
concrete for this, a little more than
one-fifth of the structure, called for
two carloads of sand, two carloads
of cement and four carloads of rock.
One and one-half carloads of tile were
used for flooring. The walls of the
first story are eighteen feet high.
The concrete structure of the new
hotel Is the third of this type, exclud
ing the University buildings, for Co
lumbia. The new building of Hetzler
Brothers, opposite the Daniel Boone
Tavern site which was completed last
spring, and the new Hall Theater on
South Ninth street, preceded the hotel.
Considerable use of this type of struc
ture is expected in building opera
tions here, insuring a better fire rat
ing for the city and more safety for
the inhabitants of the buildings.
Superintendent Rhoades was gradu
ated from the School of Engineering
of the University last June- The work
of supervising the five-story building
is his first large work.

Bapaume Fall Near.
By United Tress.
LONDON. Sept. 27. The most suc
cessful blow struck by the Anglo-
French troops since the battle of the
Marne brought the capture of Pe
ronne and Bapaume appreciably near
er. It is possible, British military ex
perts said today, that both these towns
will fall within a fortnight. In two
days of great battle the British alone
captured between three and four thou
sand prisoners.
At Combles croup after group of
Germans were cornered by the Brit
ish and French detachments. Others
fought from underground caverns un
til they were silenced by bombs.
The German in the souhwest angle
of the village stuck to their machine
guns and died fighting bravely.

TO GIVE STYLE SHOW
Merchant's Trade Festival
Will Be a Ilome-Com-
ing Week.
The merchant: fare-refund trade
festival that Is to bo held la Columbia
the second week in Octcior, offers an
opportunity for citizens of Columbia
to hae Uieir friends visit them. It
has been suggested that persons who
havo friends living within fifty miles
of Columbia, that they write their
friends to visit them during the sale
and thereby save their railroad fare.
They can come to Columbia during
tho sale, do their trading and make
their visits at the same time.
Not only are the merchants plan
ning to refund railroad fares during
the sale, but they are also planning
the most extensive exhibit of new
stylos and ctfher merchandise ithat
has ever been brought here.
The merchants of Columbia have
never before inaugurated such a com
prehensive co-operative trading week
as this promises to be. The purpose
of the fare-refund week is to show
the citizens of Boone county the ad
vantage c-f coming to Columbia to
trade.
According to the schedules of towns
that has been printed, it will be pos
sible for every citizen in Boone Coun
ty and also in neighboring counties,
to have his railroad transportation
paid by purchasing a moderate amount
of merchandise. Furthermore, It has
been emphasized that all purchases
do not have to be made in one store.
Purchases may be made at any store
co-operating in the enterprise. Each
of the stores will be provided with
cards for the windows so that cus
tomers can tell at once what stores
are welcoming their trade by repaying
their railroad fares. After the pur
chases have been made the customers
will immediately have their fares re
funded by applying at the office of
the Daily Missourian-
Following are the merchants who
have already united on the fare-rebate
trade Aveek plan. Customers from

LAMM KNOCKS MAJOR
BEFORE CROWD OF 10
Republican Candidate for
I Governor Beards Demo
cratic Lion in Den.
A BULL MOOSE THERE
C. W. Loomis Says Only
One County Progressive
Is for Wilson.
Lamm's Charges-
Gardner's Land Bank Bill uncon
stitutional and the bank cannot be
started because the state hasn't the
one million dollars necessary.
State unable to liquidate its deals
and today owes the University $151,
000. Present administration unable to
conduct the state prison.
Extravagance of the' Major adminis
tration. Attempted diversion of'schcol funds.
Gardner victory would mean four
years more of mismanagement and
interests of people unprotected.
Approximately 600 persons crowd
ed Into the Circuit Court room last
night to hear Judge Henry . Lamm,
candidate ,for governor; William C.
Askin, candidate for secretary of
state; George E. Hackmann, candi
date for state auditor and John C.
McKinley, formerly lieutenant gover
nor, tell why Republicans should be
elected to office In the state and na
tion. The principal address was by
Judge Lamm who lost no opportunity
in attacking the Major administration
and who Insisted that the election of
Gardner meant four more years of
what he termed "misrule."
E- A. Ttemley called the meeting to
order. Mr. Remley then turned the
hair over to C. W. Loomis, whom he
ntroduced as the "Progressive who
md returned to the fold." Mr. Loomis
stated that the DemocraUc party
wquU poll only about cne-slxth of
one per cent of the Boone County
Progrsjv,li. vote, ''i'c'i 'v.vmi mean
about one vote. He also said that
there had never been a third party
but, simply a Roosevelt party.
Mr. Askin of Salem urged the sup
port of the complete Republican ticket
by all Republicans. Mr. Askin also
emphfsLed tne statement Jhat hf was
no orator but simply a business man.
Mr- Hackman spoke only breifly.
"I am proud," Judge Lamm said
at the beginning of his speech, "to
be here and speak In the shadow of
i groat University that we all love.
I think if some of the students here
would give me a yell onceJn a while
that It would bring back to me some
of the happenings of the days when
I was a student hero myself."
Judge Lamm referred often to the
University and his friendship for the
institution. He spoke at length on
the Gardner Land Bank Bill pointing
out what he called unconstitutional
features and indicating that it was
Impossible to start such a bank as the
bill outlined, mainly because the
state has not at Its disposal the one
Trillion dollars necessary to establish
such an institution. (It i3 the asser
tion of the administration, Judge
Lamm contended, that It is financially
able to liquidate all its debts at once,
but if that is true, the speaker said,
"Do they claim they have money
down there to pay their debts when
they owe this magnificient University
$151,000?"
"1 challenge the fact that they owe
the Institution ifor Feeble Minded
childen at Marshall $75,000," he said.
"I have this Information from one of
the Board of Directors. In addition
to this debt to the Institution there
is a waiting list of 800 children that
tie school Is unable to take care of
and for which the state has made no
provision. The speaker challenged
the administration's ability to run the
State Penitentiary properly and de
clared there was not a Normal School
in the state that has been paid Its
iroper apportionment
"There is $3013.70 due this county
for school purposes and you would
not have received funds If the Su
preme Court had not required that
they be returned," he said. They did
not steal it, of course not, but they
used it to pay state officers' salaries
with."
The speaker gave figures to show
an Increase cf $350,000 in salaries
luring the first two years of Major's
idminlstration over the last two years
of Hadley's.
"These things can be done only by
squeezing and starving the University
and similar institutions," Mr. Lamm
explained. Quoting - the- following

For Columbia and Vicinity: Unsettled
weather with showers and thunderstorms
tonight and probahly Thursday; cooler.
For Missouri: Unsettled weather prob
ably with showers mid thunderstorms to
night and east portion Thursday; cooler.
Fresh to strong shitting winds.
Weather Conditions.
The atmospheric disturbance that started
yesterday on Its Journey across the Tlalns
is a slow traveler, partly because of n
"secondary" that .developed In Kansas, and
which now has become the dominating
feature.
Unsettled and windy conditions prevail
this morning In practically all of the ter
ritory between the Ilocky and Appalachian
mountains, and ruin has been general from
northern Missouri northward up the Mis.
sisslppl Valley, and from Montana on the
nest to the Loner Lake region anil St.
Lawrence Valley on the east. The heav
iest rains, varying in amounts betneen
one and tno Inches, fell in Mlxsourt.
The neather Is cooler this morning In
the upper Mississippi and Missouri drain
age areas, and In most of the I'ocKy
Mountain plateau. In parts of Colorado,
Utah, and Nevada temperatures are near
the freezing value.
In Columbia the weather nill continue
more or less unsettled during most of the
next thirty-six hours, but fine neather
will likely prevail Friday and Saturday.
Local Data.
The highest temperature In Columbia
yesterday was N5, and the lowest last
night was ft;; precipitation, 1.41; relative

plank "of the DemocraUc platform:
"We heartily approve and unreserved

able administration of Governor Elliott
W- Major and cur other state officers.
At no time in the history of this state
have the Interests of the people been
more conscientiously and effectively
safe-guarded and the benefits from
this administration will grow and
widen," Judge Lamm made the state
ment that. "If that is the shrine at
which Gardner worships then we will
have four more years of the same kind
of administration as the past four,
If Mr. Gardner is elected."
John C. McKinley concluded the
speaking of the evening with a dis
cussion of some of the principles of
the Republican party.
TELLS OF 01D POLITICAL DAYS
Campaigns Here 32 Years Ago Re
called by Jlr. McKinley.
John C. McKinley, in his address
at the Courthouse last night recalled
the time, thirty-two years ago, when
he was a student in the School of
Law of the University. He told how
the Democrats swarmed into Columbia
in the days of "Jim" Blaine and over
awed the small Republican following
here; how they marched through the
streets with roosters Ued to the end
of poles and with banners and torches
waving- A Republican was a curi
osity in Boone county then but now,
he said he "still has hopes even for
Boone county."
"It is time a new party came into
power in this state," he said, "the
real DemocraUc spirit is no more.
That party has veered so far from the
real spirit of the original organiza
tion as to be scarcely recognizable.
Judicial and senatorial jerrymander
ing have been perpetrated to such an
extent that it will take an overwhelm
ing majority when this state goes Re
publican. If those good old Demo
crats, Jackson and Jefferson, knew
what their successors are now doing
they would turn over in their grates.
"It is still a question of the pro
tective tariff. It is the greatest ques
tion and campaign issue that ever
came before the American people and
the protective side is the greatest part
of it. You can't name me an adminis
tration where business prosperity has
reigned without naming me one where
the protective tariff was in force.
"Well, what about Wilson's adminis
tration? True, the tariff is not in
force, but a substitute is. The great
war has prevented foreign labor from
offennr, competition to our high paid
workmen. Wi'son Is not the cause of
this prosperity. It is this substitute
protective tariff brought on by the
war."
"We will need that high tariff when
the war and the 'Wilson' prosperity
is over. What will happen when that
erent army Is martialed out? We will
be fiooded with a horde of cheap
foreign labor competing with our own.
The tariff Is a necessity-"
A 90-Year-Old Republican Attended.
Among those present at the Repub
lican mceUng last night was T. J.
Durk, 90 years old. a resident or
Hallsville and one of Boone County's j
oldest Republicans. After securing
the names and addresses of all Re- (
publican University students present
for the purpose of organizing the
Hughes-Lamm-Dickey Club of the
University, the meeting closed at
11:30 o'clock.

'ACT FOR FUTURE"
A Question of Protecting
Local Industries, Secretary
V. B. Jones Says.
The formal complaint filed by the
Retail Merchants' Association yester
day against Mrs. John F. Slurry, 30C
South Ninth street, charging violation
of the city ordinance governing the
operations of mercantile agents, was
withdrawn this afternoon. The ac
tion was taken at a meeting of the
Law Enforcement Committee Hollowing
the agreement of Mrs. Murry, through
her .attorney, Harvey Murry, to dis
continue her work as representative
of Stix-Baer-Fuller (The Grand Lead
er) of St. Louis.
"Our action in this matter was en
tirely impersonal," said Secretary V.
B- Jones of the Retail Merchants' As
sociation 'this afternoon. "It was
simply a question of protecting the
legitimate industries of the city. We
feel that the settlement of this case
will do much toward making such
steps unnecessary in the future.
"We in no way object to anyone op
erating as a mercantile agent, so long
as he pays the license fee demanded
by the city ordinance. Jt Is our duty
to, and we will, see that the ordinance
covering this matter is respected,
however.
City Attorney George S. Starrett
expressed himself as pleased with the
settlement of the case this afternoon.
"The merchants scored a victory in
their efforts to stop the operation of
out-of-town retailers In Columbia
when the agreement was reached."
MERCHANTS CARELESS, HE SAYS
Groceries and Cafes Offenders, J. Jf.
Pennington Tells Chic League.
"Conditions in the rear of grocery
stores and restaurants are Unsani
tary." said J. M. Pennington, city
health inspector, at a meeting of the
Women's Civic League at the Y. M. C.
A. Building yesterday. "The propri
etors clean up," he said, "only after
I have warned them and soon fall
back into the old rut of leaving gar
bage in open containers at their back
doors."
He emphasized the bad conditions
on Walnut street from Sixth to Third
streets, saying that though there were
sewers there was no water main. The
district is inhabited largely by ne
groes. Miss Margaret Carter, chairman of
the "City Beautiful" committee. Is at
present working toward making
Broadway more attractive to tourists,
with the co-operation of the league.
Some time this week she will an
nounce the names of the students in
the various schools who have won the
awards offered for flower gardens.
The problem of eliminating unde
sirable attractions at the local the
aters was discussed, and a day for
"movies" for the children was advo
cated. Mrs. W. E. Muns read a paper on
"Typhoid Fever, Its Causation and
Eradication."
The next meeting will be held Octo
ber 10. The subject will be "Garden
ing." MRS. MART J. JfORTHCOTT DIES
