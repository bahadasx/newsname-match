Civic League.
On Tuesday of last week a
movement was launched bv the
Woman'* Civic League of Big
Stone Gap, Which in its good to
the county of Wis?, will have
far-reaching results.
On iuvitatiou from the Civic
Leasue of this town, the mens
bers of the other Civic Leagues
of the county were, invited tofl
meet with ihetn. The meeting
was held in the Taylor store
room, which had been beauti
fully decorated for the occasion
with goidec rod anil other fall
flowers. In response to the in?
vitation fourteen ladies came
fromCoeburo, twenty-six miles
distant, eight from Norton, four
from Appalachia, and one each
from Imboden and Wise, the
last places not yet having a
civic league.
The meeti ig was opened with
prayer by Mr. Hicks, of Coe
burn, Mrs. J. L. MeCormick,
president of the league, welcom
ed the visitors in a cordial and
charming manner.
Mrs. K T. Irvine, outlined the
purpose of the meeting, which
was to form a federation of the
leagues of the county, in order
that through co-operation much
more might be accomplished as
individual leagues and, in ad?
dition, work might be under?
taken for the county itself, the
hope being that a full-time
health officer might be secured
for Wise County and visiting
nurses for the schools of the
county.
-Mrs. Irvine spoke in glowing
terms of the natural beauty of
Wise County, its wonderful
system of roads, which made
6uch a meeting as the present
one possible, ami the hope that
a county so progressive in .oth?
er matters, was now ready to
undertake this work which
would lead to such improve
meat in the health of its citi-l
zens, and introduced Mrs. J.j
Baldwin Ranson, State Super?
visor of Public Health Nurs?
ing, to outline the work of the!
State Board of Health in this!
particular.
Mr*. Ranson made a very ap?
pealing and interesting address,
holding the attention of her j
hearers throughtout, and show-1
ed conclusively the great re ;
turns in improved health and
living conditions that would
follow if a full time health of?
ficer were employed in Wise:
County.- She sketched for fieri
hearers the duiies of this officer, J
the campaign of disease preven?
tion he would wage, the im
tneu?e saving in public money
by the elimination of epidemics, I
the immense saving to the in
dividual by the elimination of I
doctors and nurses bills, paid to|
cure the ill when, by proper
prevention, illness might have
been averted. She told of the
work accomplished in the coun
ties that now have full time
health officers.
And in co-operation with the
health officers, she. urged that
the county employ a County
School Nurse. She gave statis?
tics, showing that the great per
cent of children who fail to
make their grades are chil?
dren suffering with diseased
tonsils, with adeuoids. with
hook worm and round worms,
with decayed teeth and eye
troubles. The duty of the nurse
would be to examine these
children, report the need of at?
tention to the parents and try
to secure for the child the pro?
per medical attention, especial?
ly among the poor would it be
her duty to try to secure treat?
ment for these children. She
gave most interesting experi
euces she herself had while
nursing in Lyochburg.
In closing her address, Mrs.
Kaneon said:
"Man is three fold in bis na?
ture?physical, mental and ?
spiritual--and while every where
all over the state churches and \
schools are looking after the;
spiritual and mental, very little;
is being done for the physical.
Man cannot be the efficient,;
valuable citizens he should be;
until he has 'a sound mind in a <
sound body.' In Wise County
last year $103,000.00 was spent
on the schools, and no incon-;
niderabie sum on the churches, j
and how much was invested in.
the health of the people, in the
protection and preservation of;
the best asset a community has
the strength of it's people. If
the same methods as r-.-gards
health were pursued in the
matter of mind, we would close!
our schools and spend att the I
time and money we are now'
speadiog on schools, on ?liter I
ates. hav ing first made no ef?
fort; t? prevent illiteracy. The!
Isame method applied totiioruts,,
: would lesuit in closing alt the!
churches and paying ministers!
: to spend their time in fr?-? jails,!
i trying to restore a nun to a
? state of righteousness, after hej
had fallen from grace, rather i
. than striving to ke--p trie:: from j
sin. We now let people get1
i stele, and then empl >y i doctor
i to patch them up, whereas em-'
? ploying som-'hi ? to present!
j their getting sick would prove!
economy, both in money and in ?!
[human life and efficiency. One!
person in the United States ?liesI
every two and a half minutes!
with tuberculosis, and tuber-!
culosis is a preventable disease! i
What is Wise County willing!
to do to save its people?"'
At the conclusion of Mrs.
Hanson's address the members1
lot" the league served to their!
I guests a mos; delicious lun-l
jcheon, the menu being fried j
? chicken, tomato aspic, potato!
?salad, sandwiches, ho: rolls, i
icoffee and fruit punch, the]
j tables being decorated with i
lovely vases of dowers.
The afternoon session was j
[devoted to business, the first]
j matter being a rep ort from each j
! league represented of the work ;
doneby it, and these reports'
i showed the splendid, public
spirited work accomplished by!
the women of Wise County in'
various communities.
Following this was a full dis?
cussion of tlie formation of the j
County League and the foi-!
lowing plan of organization:
NAMK:-This Association
i shall be called the Federated !
Civic Leagues of Wise County.:
PU RPOSES:?Its purposes j
I are to unite all the civic leagses i
of our county in promoting the :
betterment of conditions of
life and health, both in our,
town3 and in all parts of our]
countv and section.

with us and regardless of num-i
ber of members shall be

Letter From
Brownsville.
Brownsville. Texas, Sept. -? .
I9t$.?From the letters I have
been gutting from numerous
persons at home, it rti-* that
they do m: understand the
question about discharges. I \
would, therefore, b~ glad if you ?
would publish this i ?er,
In the first pi ice some of
them it>( m to think that I have
pv^er to grant or refuse a dis- j
charge. Thi* is a mistake. A I
captain ia the National Guard:
is a very small potatoe. The
application for a discharge is I
tirst presented to. him. He en?
dorses it "'approved" or "disap?
proved" and then passes it on
to the Colonel of the Regiment.
He likewise, "approves" or'
"disapproves" and forwards!
to the Birgade Commander, and
he to ''Higher ups'' la casei

ae's." It nii'f be true that!
'love makes * the world go
around"; but it is cersatnly
trne that it plays the devil
with a military organizaci ??:?.
With reference to students, fi
aim still ^ettui^ tnost urgent
appeals from parents and I
friends. They seem <-i have]
overlooked the part that the;
order concerning students wasj
rescinded several weeks ago. It|
is, therefore, wholly useless to',
apply for their discharge or
furlough.
I have said all I started oat I
to say but if my light holds oittj
I ?i!l add a few paragraphs)
which may be of interest.
We arrived at Richmond
with 120 men and 3 officers. |
Thirty men were ''disqualified"
on physical examination. Nine]
men transferred at Richcvjodi
to other companies {to help!
make up their minimum of]
sixty.five), and five more have |
been transferred here. Six j
have been discharged on ac
count of "dependent families."!
So we now have onlv ft enlist-1
ed men and three officers.
Among those "disqualified" |
were our First-Sergeant and ;
Quarte ril aster Sergeant,George:
Taylor and Joe Potter. Am?ag
those discharged here were W.
R. Feck appointed Firse-Ssrr
geant in Taylor's place and |
Karl Stoehr appointed in Pot-j
ter's place?all as tine for their i
jobs as any company ever
boasted of.
These "disqualification j".
?transfers" and ^'discharges
have necessitated constant:
change and have kept us tia a
turmoil?the training of me-? to
fill new positions has added to
the labor of all and greatly
impaired our efficiency. Nev?
ertheless we are still in the
riutc, and if we go to the city of
Mexico, Company H Will not
be the last to get there. The
boys are a fine set and ar-.
veloping into tine soldiers. We
stand first in our battalion and
first in the regiment.
Our non-conmmissioned of
Seers are now as follows;
Henry M. Bullits, 1st Ser
geant: S. H. McChesney, Sup

Laundry Installs New
Machinery.
Owing to the continual in?
crease of work coming to the
i Royal Laundry, R. P. Barroc,
I the proprietor, aas found it
fneccesaary to install a lot of
\ new and mcderu machinery in
order to increase its output. A
large mau^l**, used for Hat
work, together with other ma?
chinery, has been received and
I will be installed this week by
an expert from the factory.
This is one of the Gap's leading
enterprises and within Sh? last
few months its business has
nearly doubled, under the
guid wee of Mr. Barron.
