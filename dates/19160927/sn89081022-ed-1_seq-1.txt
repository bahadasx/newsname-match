ATTENDANCE AT
FAIR WAS GOOD
New London Makes Hit With
Its Band On Saturday.
The County Fair of 1916 is in local
history. Financially it was a success
The strong wind and consequent mis
hap to the airship caused a disap
pointment to the crowds as this was
the main attraction from the thrilling
standpoint. But thiB was beyond the
control of the fair management. The
races were good, and we have repeat
edly heard people comment on this
fact. The crowds seemed to have a
good time. Saturday was the best
day in the point of weather and at
tendance.
The attendance at the county fair
was good, especially when one takes
into consideration the fact that both
Thursday and Friday were very cold
and very windy. The success of
these two days proved the immense
advantage of a protecting grove. Had
the fair been located on the open
prairie these days would have been
almost entire failures. The gate re
ceipts were as follows, with a com
parison with last year:
1916
Wednesday $ 361.60
Thursday 1,046.70
Friday 901.65
Saturday 1,213.95
In the history of the fair.
1915
376.20
371.20
1,130.95
911.60
Totals $3,523.90 $2,789.95
The gate receipts for the three
years since the fairgrounds were se
cured have been as follows:
1914 $2,961.35
1915 2,7^9.95
1916 3,523.90
This year marked two substantial
improvements on the grounds. First
is the addition of the three and a half
acres of the Frost park. This prop
erty rounds out the fairgrounds park,
and will give the space for future
growth as the number of buildings in
crease. The second improvement was
the erection of the first section of the
cattle barn. Its construction gives
plenty of room and light The total
cost of the same is only $60C, which is
considered very remarkable for a barn
32x60 feet. Kerr and Chard furnish
ed the lumber and Ras. Rasmussor
did the work of erection. It is now
proposed to rebuild the old horse barn
so as to admit more light. The asso
ciation spent a good deal of money
this year in perfecting the race track,
and It Is now in good shape. The
horsemen are enthusiastic about it,
and several wish to come in and use
the track for training purposes next
year. It is bound to become a fast
track, being perfectly level, with good
lines, and protected from high winds.
Saturday was New London Day at
the fair, and the exhibition of com
munity spirit and civic pride shown
by the people from the picturesque
town on Crow River was an object
lesson of great significance. The
New London Concert Band is an or
ganization that would do credit to a
large city. In spite of the fact that
their leader, Prof. G. H. Olson and
two best players were prevented by
Illness from attending, the band made
good in furnishing the best of music.
At ten o'clock the New London tour
of cars, thirty or more, headed by the
band, in natty uniforms and twenty
five strong, marching in perfect or
der, made their entry into the city
and paraded the principal streets, fol
lowing the same with a concert on a
Fourth street square. The band
maoe a very favorable impression all
day at the grounds. New London
can boast of their day being the best
from the point of gate receipts of any

your thimbles.

SPLENDID EXHIBITS
INTEREST CROWDS
Large Crowds of People View
Products of this County
attoo Fair Last Week.
The exhibits* at the county fair this
year, ranked well up with the exhib
its of previous years, in variety at
least, tho In some classes, the quality
was not as good as in former years.
The main exposition room was
thronged with interested spectators
thruout the four days of the fair. The
produce exhibits, under the careful
eye of John Ahlstrom, were laid out
along the right and left walls of the
building, upon entering. The corn
this year was not brought in, in large
quantities, as was to be expected, ow
ing to the backward season, but the
judge stated it was the finest quality
of any corn lie had seen at a county
fair this year, which speaks well for
the corn growers of this county. The
town of New London carried away a
good share of the honors in this de
partment. John Ahlstrom's blue rib
bon single ear is one of the finest ever
seen. If he can locate nine more like
it, he would clean up the state on a
ten ear exhibit. Thomas Nelson,
whose seed corn farm is located on
Woodcock lake, won deserved recog
nition in capturing the blue ribbon on
a ten ear exhibit. Mr. Nelson makes
a specialty of seed corn and produces
a lot of it each year. Right thru, the
quality of the garden produce was ex
cellent, in fact it was never any bet
ter, and there was nearly as great a
variety of exhibits as in. former years.
About the only thing we failed to find
was egg plant. The melons, both wat
er and cantaloupe were never larger,
or better looking. The cabbage,
which was of the late variety was of
No. 1 stock. Potatoes, which have
suffered almost everywhere this year,
looked fine at the fair. There were
not as many as in other years, per
haps, but the ones shown, certainly
weie of good quality. The green pep
pers were exceptionally good, and
there were more ground cherries
shown than in a number of qther
years.
The butter exhibit was good. Nine
creameries competed. Harrison cream
ery won first Hawick, second and
Svea, third. Mrs. Albert Lundqulst
won first on dairy butter, Mrs. P. P.
second and Mrs. O. Rykken
third. The score is given elsewhere.
The exhibit of the Kandiyohi coun
ty rural schools was fine, and atract
ed a good share of attention. Tak
ing everything into consideration,
there was a larger variety in most of
the exhibits, all the way thru, than
formerly, altho the cooking and vege
table entries from the country were
not as numerous as heretofore. As
to quality, the sewing and cooking
were especially fine. An added feat
ure of this department were the In-Prohlbtlon
dividual exhibits shown by seven or
eight of the rural schools. Mrs. Dru
silla Baldwin was in charge of this
department.
The cooking department, as in for
mer years, had an exceedingly attrac
tive display. The department contin
ued to grow both in quality and quan
tity of exhibits entered, altho there
was not as much bread entered as
formerly. This was laid to the high
price of flour, by the superintendent,
Mrs. James Sanderson.
G. J. BJornberg had charge of the
fruit department, acting as substitute
for John Wicklund, during his ab
sence, and he informed us that the ex
hibits this year were not up to the us
ual standard, which was to be expect
ed, in* view of the wet weather early
in the season. The fruit was small,
all the way thiu, but the Judge, Mr.
Haroldsoni, stated it was of better
quality than that shown at the state
fair, and at other county fairs he had
visited this season. The rain and cold
weather early in the year made the
apple crop a little dubious, but in
view of everything, the showing in
this deartment was very good. Peo
ple from the state of Illinois, who
viewed the exhibit at the same time
we did, stated they could not help but
notice how much better the apples,
and apple trees looked in this com
munity, than in their home state.
The public schools had a good ex
hibit of work done in the manual
training department, and also a large
number of bird houses, drawings, etc.
on exhibition in their booth.
In the center of the building the
farm) clubs had their booths. Five
clubs were entered this year, in the
contest for supremacy, and they fin
ished in the order named: Svea Farm
Club, Green Lake Farm Club, Sunny
side, Golden Rod and South Ed
wards. The race for first place was
close. All the booths were very hand
somely gotten up and the exhibits ex
ceptionally fine. A new entry in the
list this year was the Golden Rod
Club, and their exhibit was good, and
the members feel encouraged to
tackle it another year. The farm club
booths are easily the greatest draw
ing card of any one department of ex
hibits, reflecting as they do commun
ity spirit and co-operative effort, and
deserve and no doubt will receive
more encouragement than so far has
been accorded them.
The art department this year, was
piobably more crowded than any oth
er single department. Heretofore, It
has always been possible to get all
the entries onto the stage, but what
a difference there was this time. The
stage contained only fancy work ex
hibits, and the quilts, pillows, etc.,
were shown in a separateTbooth, and
the children's exhibits were also
shown In a booth by themselves. En
tries that caused comment in this de
partment were a number of rafeal
baskets, and a table lamp: made from
the same material. Other booths In
the building were those of W. P. Elk
Jer, the photographer, Xlson Brothers,
photographers, Onsberg^ Selvlg and
Co., hardware dealers O. W. Kroona,
the Modern Woodmen of America,
with a rest room, the Willmar Semi
nary and the University Farm School
at Morris, Minnesota.
The poultry department was the
best ever. Better in many respects
than in former years, and with more
varieties of birds shown, Judge C. A.
Smith said It was the finest exhibit
of poultry he had ever seen at a Min
nesota county fair. This year there
was no children's contest, but there
were many more birds entered by far
mers thruout the county than prev
iously. There were about two hun
dred fifty birds in the show which
was presided over by Mrs. P. M. Long
who took great pride and Interest in
seeing that the displays were proper
ly classified and cared for. J. R.
Streeter of Montrose was on hand
with 12 birds, In the White Plymouth
Rock class. The birds were beauties.
One hen entered by Mr. Streeter was
a blue ribbon winner at Chicago. The
county poultry association held a
meeting Thursday evening in the
poultry tent, which was addressed by
Mr. Smith. Plans were discussed for
securing a poultry building on the
grounds before next fair.
John Swenson had his blue ribbon
winner Big Wonder, Duroc-Jersey hog
on deck, and he was the object of
much admiration by the visitors. The
showing thruout the live stock de
partment was not up to that of last
year, not owing to lack of good ani
mals in the county, but owing to the
backward season with all farmers
working over time to fill their silos.
C. A. Syvertson of Arctander was on
hand again with his herd of Jersey
cattle, making the long trip, sixteen
miles each way, for the third consec
