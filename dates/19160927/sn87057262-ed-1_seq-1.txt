Friday, blames the American soldiers
—of whom one was killed and another
slightly injured—for the trouble.
Funston'a report reached the war de

patch from .General Pershing. Sev
eral American cavalrymen from Per
shing's column, the report said, ran
the guard at the B1 Valle camp,
went Into the town and engaged in a
saloon row with Carranzista soldiers.
One Carranzista officer was killed
and one soldier wounded. One Ameri

drunken row," Pershing concluded.
WESTCOTT
IS DEFEATED
Man Who Nominated Wilson for
Ujx President Lost Out at New

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
TRENTON, X. J., Sept. 27.—John W.
Westcott, who nominated President
Wilson at the St. Louis convention
and Is understood to have been the
president's choice for democratic
senatorial nomination in New Jersey,
has been defeated by Senator James
Martine, incomplete returns indicated
today.
With 723 of 1,895 districts heard
from, the vote was, Martine, 12,844
Westcott, 6,897*.
Martine was strongly supported by
German-Americans and also by Irish
Americans, who applauded' his resolu
tion for intervention by the president
in the execution of Roger Casement.
Westcott is said to have lost many la
bor votes because he prosecuted per
sons arrested during the Roosevelt
New Jersey strike. Incomplete re
turns today indicate that Senator
Walter E. Edge, of Atlantic county,
won the republican gubernatorial nom
ination over Austin Colgate and
•George T. Record by a plurality esti
mated at from 5,000 to 8,000.
It also appears that former Gover
nor Fra^lin Murphy defeated former
Senator Joseph S. Frelinghuyen for
the republican nomination for U. S.
senator by a majority of about 3,000.
Naval Officer H. Otto Wlttpenn was
unopposed for the democratic guberna
torial nomination.

CHANCELLOR IS OPPOSED
Voting of War Credits and Future
Policy Toward England Will be
Discussed Three
Weeks.
[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
BERLIN, Sept. 21'. The stormiest
session of the reichstag since the be
ginning of the war, was overshadowed
today in discussions in Berlin hotels
by members who arrived for the open
ing session tomorrow. Dr. Coerting,
on industrial leader from Hanover, will
move a vote of no confidence in Chan
cellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg. Coert
ing represents one of the center party
groups waging war on the chancellor.
(A vote of confidence in the German
relchstag does not carry the signifi
cance attaching to similar action in
most European parliaments, where
such an expression of displeasure is
followed by the resignation of the
ministry.)
The absence of Dr. Liebknecht, radi
cal socialist, arrested several weeks
ago for taking part in a disturbance
in Berlin, will certainly not contribute
to a calm session, though Lieb
knecht was probably the reichstag's
most disturbing member.
Other opponents of the government
are ready to launch attacks as soon
as the bars are let down for debate.
The chancellor will address the
relchstag at 3 p. m. on subjects not
yet revealed. The voting of war cred
its and Germany's future policy to
ward England will be the chief top
ics of the three weeks session.
The concervatives are pleased at
results of Zeppelin raids and will de
mand a more active English campaign.

*?*).#. ROME, Sept. 27.—It is now practically certain that no new American cardinal will be
created at the papal consistory to be held in November. Archbishop Hanna, of San Fran
cisco, it has been stated, would receive first consideration, if another American was awarded
the red hat.
The diate of the consistory has been set for November 20-27. It is rumored in Vatican
circles that Pope Benedict, in his allocution to the cardinals, will invite a re-establishment
of relations between France and the Vatican, appealing to France as a daughter of the
church.

LONDON, Sept. 27.—A wireless dis

ported that the Greek cabinet has de
cided to resign and that the king will
issue a proclamation immediately aft

firmed, was accepted as further indi
cation that Grece may be prepari\g

Revolution is Spreading.
LONDON, Sept. 27—Wholesale de
fections from the Greek army were re
ported in Athens dispatches today,
hinting that a declaration of war may
be expected at any time.
Practically every garrison in old
Greece has joined the revolutionary
movement, said one Athens dispatch
and the soldiers are leaving for Sa
lonika. A large number of naval offi
cers have left Piraeus and the Greek
cruiser Lon-ehi, reported to be under
control of the revolutionists, slipped
out of the harbor bound for either
Crete or Salonika.
An Exchange Telegraph dispatch
from Athens said the cabinet con

that the cabinet will resign.

Calling Out of All Organized
Labor in New York City
in Support of Street
Car Men. .'-s
•••'.'•
NUMBER IS NOT KNOWN
First Day of Sympathetic Strike Has
No Great Effect and the
City Not
Paralyzed.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW YORK. Sept. 27.—The gen
eral strike, designed to call out all
organized labor in New York City, in
support of the striking car men, was
scheduled to become effective today.
It was generally admitted, however,
that the exact number who may re
spond to the call cannot be definitely
estimated, owing to the large number
away from work because of the Jew
ish holidays, which start tonight.
Outside figures showed that about
3*00,000 workers might be absent to
day, but a majority of these were of
the Hebrew trades, out in preparation
of celebrating New Year's.
No general walkout by union men
throughout the city was apparent
and the industrial life of New York
is apparently in no immediate danger
of paralyzation.
Labor leaders predict that one
hundred thousand union workers will
be added each morning to those on
strike "until the suspension of work
brings about victory in approximately
forty-eight hours.
Many of the unions have deferred
action until tomorrow or the first of
next week, while officials of a few
locals were declaring definitely for
the sympathetic strike.
longshoremen who were expected
to give the greatest support to the
striking car men have decided not
to strike just now. The tide-water
boatmen, the coopers and the steam
winch engineers also postponed
action, so the harbor is not tied up.
President O'Connor, of the long
shoremen's union, who less than a
week ago declared, "you can bet
your life there'll be a sympathetic
strike," left for Washington, stating
that he had not ordered a strike for
today and refusing to comment furth
er.
Mayor Mitchel and Governor Whit
man are not taking any definite
action today regarding the strike, so
far as is known. The mayor called
into conference Hugh Frayne, organ
«er of the American Federation of
Labor, and asked him what he ex
pected to have happen. Frayne re
plied that they expected 200,000 men
to go out "as a-starter."
I Only one union so far has gone out
in sympathy with the striking car
men, according to the best police in
formation early today. Painters'
union 442 struck and was the first to
walk out.
But Few are Quitting.

unions in New York were today

employers and there was little re-

Little Willie Zimmer Who
Killed His Parent When
She Tried to Beat Him
With Stick.
CLUB WOMEN'S PLAN
Youth Will Not be Prosecuted for
Murder, But Is to be Given
New Chance In
Life.
[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
NEW ORLEANS, La., Sept. 27.—An
"official" mother will take the place
of the mother of little Willie Zimmer,
shot to death by Willie last July
when she tried to beat him. This
was the plan today of club women
who have interested themselves in
the 12-year-old boy's case.
Chandler C. Lusenberg, district at
torney, who has been in accord with
all plans suggested by the club women
and children of the Crescent city, said
he thought the "official" mother idea
would be carried out.
Sometime next week Lusenberg,
Judge Joshua Baker, of the criminal
court of correction, and Judge Andrew
H. Wilson,-of the Juvenile court, will
hold a conference. It is planned to
have several club women attend and
aid in making definite plans for Wil
lie's future. It is possible that the
"Official mother" will be selected at
this time. Just who will draw the as
signment, there was no hint, but at
least two socially prominent New Or
leans women have asked to take the
place of Mrs. Zimmer. The Zimmer
lad has lost some of his sulklness.
The notoriety and attention that haa,
'been thrust upon him has brought
about a change of dignity. Willie was
busy lokin^ through a motion picture
magazine today wnen told of the "of
ficial" mother plan.
"You can't have another mother
when your regular mother is dear,"
he said. "A fellow has only one
mother. And I killed mipe.".
He seemed little affected when he
spoke of the mother he killed with
two shqts as she raised a hroomBtlck
to chastise him for offending her.
"Will you be good to your next
toother?" he was asked.
"Certainly I will," he replied, with
out looking up from the magazine.
"But, say, will she have an automo
bile? I think I'd like to ride in one of
these motor cars these ladies have
been telling me about."
Laying his magazine aside, he told
his questioners he had been longing
for a' "regular auto ride" all his life.
"My only rides," he continued, "have
been stolen on the back of big
trucks."
Then he launched Into general dis
cussion of motion pictures. Although
he said he had npt seen a "movie"' for
years, he spoke of all the latest pic
tures and their stars. He said Mary
Pickford was his favorite film star
and he hoped he could see her on the
screen when he got his new mother.

PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Sept. 27.—
Walking into a room on the ninth
floor of the Hotel Walton early today,
a woman, believed to be Mrs. J. C. La

C. Gravler, president of the Alham«
bra Garage company, of New York,
critically wounding his wife and then
turned the pistol upon herself and
committed snictde.
The woman, who was wounded, was

other woman, whose body was found
beside that of Gravler, holding a re*
volver, had a hand bag In whfch w&a
a card hearing the name of Mrs. J.
C. Ladur.
The tragedy IS shrouded in mystery
and only conjectures could be made
as to the motive of the crime. Detec
tives were certain that jealousy
played the principal part in the shoot*
lng.
Gravier and the woman who was
registered as his wife, motored here
to this city from New York. They
took a room in the Walton and w*ra.
not seen to leave their room. Last
night, however, the pair went to a
theatre and afterward took lunch, re

fell at his feet unconscious. He
called for help. He rushed down the
hall way and noticed an open door.
On the floor he saw the bodies of the
other woman and the man.
The shots wore not heard by any
one in the hotel or on the street. A
dance was in progress on the roof
garden immediately above the room
where the triple shooting occurred.
Dr. Herbert M. G-oddard, the house
physician, gave first aid to the dying
woman. She was then sent to the
Jefferson hospital. She will not live.
It is believed that the woman slayer
ran upstairs to the room of her vie
