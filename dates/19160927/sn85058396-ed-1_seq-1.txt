II Smashing Offensive of Franco-British I I
) Forces on Somme Front Continues I
French Start New Drive to
I Pocket German Stronghold
I -Serbs Repulse Bulgarians
I No rest Is being given the Germans
toy the victorious Franco-British forces
f$M on the Soinme front.
4 The British capture of the long-re-sisting
Thiepval stronghold, following
; closely and unexpectedly upon.- the
capture of Combles by the combined
allied forces, -was followed up last
night by a new strong on the part of
the French south of the Somme, where
they drove out the enemy from Ver-
' ! niandovillers and captured a strongly
fortified work east of the town two
; miles from Chaulnes.
Apparently this new drive Is aimed
-a at Chaulnes which bears to the south
; ern end of the Somme line somewhat
!" the relation that Combles did to the
northern sector. The beginning of a
French effort to pocket this other Ger
man stronghold was apparent some
' time ago.
Meanwhile the military importance
of the gains from Thiepval to the
1 Somme, scored in the smashing of
fensive of the last week, are expect-
cd by military observers in the en
tente capitals, to be made manifest by ,
j speedy further inroads upon German-j
held terrltorj'. The French advance
beyond Bouchavesnes is pointed to as
j directly threatening Allaines, two
. miles north of Peronne and preparing
j the way for an encircling movement
intended to drive the Germans out of
, Peronne itself.
Belated reports from the British
front today announce the capture of
between 3,000 and 4,000 Germans by
General Haig's forces in the fighting
Monday and Tuesday. The reported
: capture by the French bring this total
up to more than 0,000. Unofficial fig
i ures show the aggregate number of
. prisoners taken by the Anglo-French
' armies during the Sommo offensive,
from July 1 to date, have been 60,000
with some 190 square miles of terri
tory and 44 villages.
In Macedonia the entente forces ap
j parently are encountering a stiffened
Bulgarian resistance especially west
of the Vardar region. Paris reports
Kaimakacalan height subjected to re
peated attacks by Bulgarian forces,
but declare the Serbians held fast to
the captured position.
Greece apparently is on the verge
of entering the war on the side of
the entente, King Constantine being
now reported to have consented to
IEUch action.

Terrific Fight at Hinge of Bat
tle Front Germans Locked
in Dugouts by Debris.
TANKS AID IN ATTACK
i
AH Power British Guns Could
Command Brought Against
Every Art of Modern
Defense.
!
British Front in France, Sept. 27,
via London. 3:03 p. m. The total
number of prisoners for what are re
garded in all quarters as the best two
days the British army has had in
France, approaches 5,000.
Through the night there was heavy
fighting, while the British were press
ing forward their guns in the path of j
tho preceding day's gains. The sun
rose with a promise of another splen
did autumn day, only to become over
cast later. This Interfered with all
important artillery observations.
More than one thousand prisoners
were taken in Thiepval and the Zol
lern work. In a military sense, this
work, lying between Thiepval and
Courcelette, was regarded as more Im
portant than the crushed ruins of the
village. Here at the hinge of the bat
tle front with tho old first line forti
fications, all the power British guns
could command has fought against
every art of modern defense. German
dugouts which were so deep that the
12-inch high explosive shell could not
penetrate them, had their doors closed i
in by debris from explosions. Indeed, i
with shell fire of all sorts, the British 1
literally locked tho Germans in their
refuge, and, under cover of Its curtain,
appeared at the remaining open door
ways of the dugouts, which were all
connected with underground galleries,
and marched out the occupants as
prisoners.
The "tanks" or new armored motor
cars assisted in the attack, over
whelming machine gun positions.
The taking of Thiepval and Zollern
work means that the German gun po
sition around Grand Court and in the
valley of the Ancre have been revealed
and already the Germans are reported
to have begun withdrawal of their bat
teries in that neighborhood.

Measures were taken to meet the
the situation and a desperate battle
began on a front stretching from the
Danube to the Black sea.
"The fighting opened along tho
Danube where enemy columns con
sisting mostly of Germans endeavored
to force their way into Chernavoda.
This effort was defeated by the Ru
manians who repelled bayonet attacks
supported by the fire of three moni
tors in tho river, brought the advance
of the enemy to a standstill.
Enemy Forces Mowed Dovn.
"In two days fighting of the most
desperate character, the enemy suf
fered heavy losses, his massed forma
tions being moved down by artillery
firo. In the ce"hter he was driven
from trenches, which he momentarily
succeeded in penetrating, by tho al
lied Rumanian, Russian and Serbian
troops.
"Finally at 9 o'clock in the evening
of September 19 the enemy onslaught
reached its climax. The allies by a
formidable counter attack overthrow
tho enemy's right wing which fled.
iThe enemy losses were great. Every

SMALL RESPONSE
TO STRIKE CALL
Twenty-two Unions Fail to

With Striking Carmen.
LABOR CIRCLES QUIET
Leaders Claim 263,000 Work
ers Will Be Added to Ranks
Tomorrow.
New York, Sept, 27. Union work
ers to tho number of 125.G00 went on
strike today in sympathy with the
striking traction employes, according
to figures given out at a meeting of
representatives of labor unions.
Far less than 125,000 union em
ployes responded to the call, accord
ing to reports received at police head
quarters today. The officials said,
however, that it was difficult to ob
tain an accurate estimate and declin
ed to fix a definite figure.
New York, Sept. 27. Tho general
strike of labor unions in sympathy
with the striking street car men was
supposed to be effective today and al
though labor leaders claimed that
some 250,000 workers had responded
to the call, there was little evidence
that a strike was in progress.
Private canvasses among the labor
unions reported that at least 22 un
ions had failed to respond to strike
calls this forenoon. The only report
received at police headquarters was
that 250 members of the Painters' un
ion had refused to report for work.
Among the unions which failed to
go out today was the brewery work
ers, numbering 6000 but their leaders
declared they would strike tomorrow.
These were the figures reported to
tho meeting by the union delegates,
according to Ernest Bohm, state or
ganizer of the American Federation of
Labor. The trades which have re
sponded to the strike call, he said, are
the "United Garment Workers, six
building trades unions, the paper
hangers' unions, painters, house
wreckers and a number of small or
ganizations. Bohm declared that 263,
000 more would go out tomorrow.

CROP BULLETIN
IS FAVORABLE
Washington, Sept. 27. Widespread
mild weather with mostly dry temper
atures was decidedly favorable for
harvesting and other field work gen
erally throughout the week which end
ed Tuesday, according to the National
Weather and Crop Bulletin today in
its final weekly issue of the season.
Corn cutting, silo filling, threshing,
harvesting tobacco, potato and beet
digging and cranberry picking made
fine progress. Much fall plowing and
grain seeding were accomplished, but
dry soil seriously hindered this work
in parts of Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri
and northern Texas, and in tho ma
jority of tho states oast of tho Mis
sissippi river.
Gathering of hay and fodder made
excellent progress, but fall pastures,
late feed crops and late truck and
gardens need rain. Picking and gin
ning of cotton has been pushed in
practicnlly all parts of the belt with
very favorablo weather.

IS ASKED FOR
American Bankers Would En
act Legislation That Would
Avert "Costly Conflicts."
APPEAL TO CONGRESS
Committee From Savings
Bank Association Want
Hearing on Railroad
Legislation.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 27. Con
gressional legislation In regard to rail
roads which would make federal con
trol superior to that of the states, was
asked in resolutions adopted arid an
nounced today by the savings bank
section of the American Bankers' as
sociation in annual convention hero.
The resolutions declared that rail
road improvements had been arrested
because of the "costly conflicts" aris
ing between the 'various state and
congressional rulings in the super
vision of the railroads.
Investors Fear Confusing Laws.
Less new mileage was built last
year than in one-half a century with
more linos in bankruptcy than at any
time in the history of the country, the
resolutions set forth. This was said
to be due "in a large measure to the
impairment of railroad growth because
of investment hesitancy which has
arisen Hn consequence of the confu
5ion7waste and inefficiency of rail
road supervision by congress and at
the same time by 48 states."
Congress is asked ln the resolutions
to hear the committee from the say
ings bank section before adopting any
railroad legislation.
Officers elected by the state secre
taries section were: Major S. B. Ran
kin, Columbus, Ohio, president;. F. H.
Colburn, San Francisco, first vice
president; George D. Bartlett, Mil
