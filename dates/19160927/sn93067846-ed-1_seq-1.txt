Mate allies dosig i to control shlp

the hast advantage of the allies nnd
ptevent in even Indirectly aiding their
opponents, according to a statement
made to the Associated Press today
by Lord Robert Cecil, minister of
war trade.
Lord Robert admitted that even the
present rate of destruction, without
considering the possibility of a re
suntpttoe of unrestricted submarine
warfare, meant a serious lose to the
World's tonnage sod that consequent?
ly it could not be expected that Brit?
ten ciiel or other British facilities
shooM he expended on ships carrying

tente allies will Increase their ship

proving their vaUe, In making the

Tan minister it wax trade said
that I is a matter ?>f course the entente
elites would be favored, as regards
the ?so of tonne? e, and that neutrals
engaged la entente allied trade or in
oaeuapeeted neutral trade would he
given the neat consideration. Neu?
trale suspected or unneutral acts, he
declared, would iot enjoy the usual
families. Lord Robert said that the

ly to a desire to rive first a practical

recently Instituted in censoring meth?
ods; notably wit \ regard to shipping
documents. They declare the prac?
tice of expediting the handling, of
such papere by pissing them through
the censor's otH<e in special marked

the principal causes of complaint set
the American protest,
department officials con?
sistently have declined to indicate
the possible offen of this modifica?
tion of the department's attitude In
the malls controversy. It Is recalled,
however, that wren Great Britain in
a previous note iravo assurances that
seised mail would be expedited as
much as possible, the United StaU
replied that one of the chief causey
of dlwpleasure here over the allied
censorship arose from the conviction
that the seisures in themselves were

The allied dlpk mats point out that
the delay ty ship >tng documents also
was emphasised as a cause of com

One of the handsomest mercfttfl
tile establishments in Sumter is ttm
bulding, now rapidly nearing comit?H
tion, orectod by Neill O'Donnell on ttm
site, to replace the O'Donnell & Cq*M
I pany building, which was destroJ?
I by firo on the morning of Thanksgnj
ing Df.y las?, year. The new structujj
has cost over $30,000 and providM
quarters for O'Donnell & CompawJ
and for the newly organised O'Ddfl
nell Dry Goods Company. The
company, In fact, has already tak?l
up Its quarters in the new bull*?!
and O'Donnell & Company will OTOfl
ably remove from their present quajB
ters into their new store about tm
latter part of next week. At pres?
the carpenters and painters are pjfl
ting the finishing touches to the buMH
lng and the furnishers are InstaUhjj
flxturos which will fully equip
stores. .-S
This addition to Sumter's me*aul
tile establishments Is one of which tjgfl
city may justly feel proud, ^ lflffl
spurious two-story structure of mH
proof design, danger of fire being rj
duced to a minimum. The en*m
structure is of reinforced conctfflH
walls, floors and roof; there is nottH
ing in the building to burn or to estttj
nre except the goods. In fact the na9
floor of hardwood is laid on retofUnfl
ed concreto, the door and wlaVM
frames \ A woodwork In the 1

the walls and ' floors and Insure
strength and Indestructibility to the
work.
The building has a handsome front
fifty-four feet wide and extends back
to a depth of one hundred and forty
feet. The front is most attractively
designed, the material being of white
terra cotta, to which has been added a
glazed finish. The trimmings and
cornices are of copper, and prism
glass over the show windows and door
ways is used in providing transoms
for light and ventilation. Higher up
or. the front numerous windows af?
ford plenty of light and ventilation.
The whole is of Gothic design, with
attractive trimmings anu . appoint?
ments.
In the center of the front near the
parapet In raised letters is placed
"Neill O'Donnell?1916," indicating?
the builder and date of erection.
The large plate glass show windows
catch the eye of the passerby. The
windows are finished with copper
trimmings and the Moots are of high?
ly polished oak. An indirect or X-ray
lighting system, well calculated to af?
ford a bright illumination, is employ?
ed to show off goods to best advan?
tage. The store entrance is raised a
few inches above the side walk by a
granite sill, and tho vestibules are of
tile.
Inside of the door, one is at once
struck by the commodious size of each
of tho two stores and the neatness of
tho finish. The fixtures are the most
convenient and modern employed by
any store in the city, the establish?
ment being completely equipped ac?
cording to the latest designs. The ma?
terials are of an excellent quality. The
furnisher stated that while ho had
furnished larger buildings, he had not
seen one any where in the State whero
the establishment was better equipped
in point o* quality and thoroughness.
Asothcr workman who Is having tho
pulntlng done stated that the building
was the best mercantile house In the
Stato, in his opinion.
On the O'Donnell & Company side
I of the building the first floor will be
used for sales room and offices and
[the second lloor for storing goods. This
side of the building has been enlarged
from what the former building was
by the addition of an L* whleh in It- (
self is a god sized store room.
On the first floor the O'Donnell
Dry Goods Company will have its re- i
tall dry goods and clothing business,
while tho second floor will he used
as a store room for goods, exeept for
the front part, which is partitioned
off and will he used as a sales room
for ladles' ready-to-wear. This room
Is connected with the first floor by a
spiral stairway in the front of tho
store. 1
- The building has been equipped
rtth electric and gas lights, the latter
King already in use. Under the stair
fay is a large Are proof vault fitted
lut with steel shelves for the books
td safety boxes for the papers of the
mpany. Elevators and stairways
honnedt the first floors, the elevator
in the dry goods side being operated
hy hand, while that in the grocery side
la operated by electric power. The
second floor as well as the first is well
provided with light ?5 and ventilating
facilities. There ? j numerous wln

p~ O'Donnell & Company first began
I business in fs83 in a small store on
Liberty street, the entire quarters then
not being any larger than one small
corner of the present % building. In
V906 the company was incorporated
-Ith a capital stock of $75,000 which
has steadily increased until at pres?
ent the capital and surplus of the
company are now over $300,000. At
the time of Incorporation the officers
chosen were Neill O'Donnell, presi?
dent; S. R. Chandler, vice president;
land D. W. Cuttino, secretary and
[treasurer, who are still the officers of
the company. The company, before
lit was burned out, dealt in general
merchandise, but O'Donnell & Com?
pany will now do only a cotton, gro?
cery and fertilizer business. The of?
ficers of the company hope to move
from their present to their new quar?
ters the latter part of next week to
be there by the first of October.
To secure the dry goods trade for?
merly held by O'Donnell & Company,
a new concern has been Incorporated
with a capital stock of $25,000. This
company is the O'Donnell Dry Good."
Company and will occupy one of the
two large stores in the building. The
officers of the company are: Presi?
dent, Neill O'Donnell; vice president,
Samuel Sanders; secretary and treas?
urer, R. P. Monaghan. Mr. Sanders
will manage the dry goods depart?
ment of this concern and Mr. Pat Gal
langher will manage the clothing de?
partment. This concern has already
begun business, having opened its
doors a few days ago, but has not yet
fully arranged the goods which are
[steadily coming in.
The re-opening of O'Donnell & Co.
I in their old quarters shows the Sum?
ter spirit of Sumter concerns to "come
back." Last lall when the store with
its entire contents was totally de?
stroyed by fire with a tremendous loss,
the officers did not sit idle and grieve
over the company's loss, but under the
guidance of Mr. Neill O'Donnell, the
active business head of the establish?
ment in whose hands it hau grown
from a small business to one of .the
largest concerns in central South Car?
olina, the company at once opened a
store in new and limited quarters,
where it has been doing business for
nearly a year. It now "comes back"
in handsomer and more spacious quar?
ters than heretofore and on ns firm
a base, if not a firmer one, than ever
before and ready for the future, with
all of its vicissitudes.

YOUNG MAN MAKES RASH LEAP.
CADET JUMPS FROM THIRD GAL?
LERY, FORTY FEET TO QUAD?
RANGLE AT CITADEL.
Mouth Terribly Mashed but Few
Hones Are Broken and He Will
Survive?-Doesn't Lose Conscious?
ness and Tells Why He Leaped to
Apparently Certain Death,
News and Courier.
G. P. Ashe, member of the third
(sophomore) class and a corporal at
the Citadel, was painfully and serious?
ly, though probably not fatally injured
when he leaped from the third gallery
to the quadrangle yesterday morning,
just before reveille was sounded by
the bugler.
Cadet Ashe was Immediately taken
into the Citadel hospital and Dr. Rob
bert S. Cathcart, Citadel surgeon, sum?
moned, arriving within a few minutes.
The cadet corporal on guard also
notified Col. O. J. Bond, superintend?
ent of the military college.
After a careful examination of Ca?
det Ashe, it was stated that his face
on the right side, had been badly
mashed and the knuckle on the right
elbow fractured, but that no other
bones had been broken.
Cadet Ashe never lost conscious?
ness and at Intervals during the day
answered questions clearly. He ap?
peared, however, to be somewhat in a
mental haze. At tho direction of the
surgeon, he moved his legs and exer?
cised various muscles.
The corps of cadets was stunned
by the affair. Cadet Ashe, who is
nineteen years old, stands well in his
class, finishing his first year quite
near the top. He was appointed a
corporal, indicating proficiency in the
military department. His family lives
at York. .
About ten minutes before revills,
which is sounded at 6.30 a. m., Cadet
Ashe,.fully dressed, left his room, af?
ter telling his brother he was not
able to sleep. He appears to have
read his Bible before taking the leap.
Asked for his reason, he stated that
Jter- IwteV^e?jfc .d?a^^et^A?s^^ee^
he was losing his grip. He wrote I
brief note giving these reasons.
It is felt that Cadet Ashe will re?
cover, despite the desperate character
of the jump. It Is about forty feet
from the fioor of the third gallery to
the quadrangle, which is paved with
cement. It is considered miraculous
that the young man was not Instantly
killed.

AMERICAN FLYER KILLED.
KIFFEN YATES ROCKWELL SHOT
TO DEATH IN AEROPLANE.
In Battle With German?Young Car?
olinian, Aviator for French Army,
Loses Life on Western Front.
Winston-Salem, N. C, Sept. 23.?
Kiffen Yates Rockwell, formerly of
Ashcville and Atlanta, who has been
serving with the French aero corps
on the Western battle front, was kill?
ed this morning in a fight with a Ger?
man aircraft. Announcement of his
death was contained in a cablegram
from Paris received here late today
by his mother, Mrs. L. A. Rockwell,
of this city. '
The message announcing the avia?
tor's death came from a friend of the
famfly in Paris and read as follows:
"Kiffen killed this morning in ae
i rial battle in Alsace."
Young Rockwell served at Verdun
during the long months of fighting
' there and succeeded in bringing down
i four German aeroplanes unassisted.
! For this feat he recently received a
war cross and military medal from
the hands of Gen. JofTre, who refer
' red to him as "a hold and courageous
1 pilot." He had been mentioned fre?
quently for bravery in official reports.
Mrs. Rockwell received a letter
from her son only a few hours before
the cablegram came telling her of his
death. In the letter he said that be
had been granted a leave of absence of
eight days and had spent it in Paris
with his brother Paul Rockwell, who
had been severely wounded earlier
in the war and discharged from the
French army. On the day that the
letter was mailed in Paris, Rockwell
left for the front. He wrote that he
had been transferred from Verdun to
a more active sector.
When the war began Kiffen Rock?
well was connected with an advertis?
ing agency in Atlanta. With his
brother Paul, who was a reporter
on the Atlanta Constitution, he went
to France. They enlisted in the for?
eign legion and began service on Sep
? PHe^Hffen remainedTw^B
(The legion until It was wiped out
' after seven months of fighting in tho
J trenches. He then asked for a trans?
fer to the aero corps and began train?
ing. In the meantime his brother had
' decided to remain in Paris and he be?
gan as a special correspondent there
for several American newspapers,
which he now is serving.
Kiffen Rockwell was born on Sep?
tember 20, 1892, at Newport, Tenn.
His father was a Baptist minister of
North Carolina. His mother was
Miss Lula Ayers, a member of a
prominent South Carolina family.
Rockwell's father died when the boy
was two years old and later Mrs.
Rockwell moved with her two sons
to Asheville, N. C, where they lived
for many years. Kiffen Rockwell was
a graduate of Washington & Lao
university and also attended the Vir?
ginia Military institute for a time
