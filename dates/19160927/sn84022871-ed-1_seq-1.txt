BIG FIRE LOSS IN NEWPORT
Wheeler Livery Stable Total JLoss. Fif
teen Horses and Two Autos Burn.
Origin of Fire Unknown.
Newport suffered a severe fire early
this morning, when the building owned
by Harry Stewart and occupied by
Wheeler's livery stable, was complete
ly destroyed by fire and the roof and
ell of the Drew block occupied by

Fifteen horses and two automobiles,
besides all the equipment of sleighs,
wagons, harnesses, etc., were a total
loss with insurance of only $3,000 on

motive whose occupants first discov
ered the blaze bursting through the
roof of the Wheeler stable. Seven

blaze and kept it under control.
The origin of the fire is unknown,

the livery stable burned three years
ago.

TILE PARALYSIS. Dr. C. Bol-
& duan, director "or public educa-
0 tlon of the New York city

0 Within twelve hours the patient
8 is unable to move his arms or
S legs and sometimes cannot talk.
Vomiting, delirium, twitchlngs
8 and convulsions accompany the
8 progress of the disease. 3
S A temperature of from 100 to
106 degrees lasts two or three 0
days. 8
Sometimes, but rarely, the pa- 3
tlent has chills, sore throat and S
skin eruptions.
Health is no protection. Often S
children go to bed apparently

3 Cleanliness is the only known g

S The isolation of children in the
S house is next in importance.

Don't cough in their faces.

Morrisville Afraid of Paralysis.
A case of infantile paralysis having
appeared in Elmore, a meeting of the
local board of health of Morristown
was held, with two of the local physi
cians besides the health officer pres
ent, also several business men, and
the question of closing the schools and
other public places was thoroughly dis
cussed. It was finally decided after
consultation with the secretary of the
state board of health to close the
churches and local theatorium, but al
low the schools to continue, all of the
five physicians of Morrisville to be at
the village schools each morning for a
period of two weeks to examine every
pupil with the understanding that the
parents should have the option of keep
ing their children at home providing
that they confine them strictly to their
own premises, keeping them apart
from all other children.
ard and Dr. Henry S. Goodall of Ben
nington, accompanied the body of their
aunt, Miss Sophia Skinner, here for
burial on Tuesday.
There has been much activity at the
rooms of the Barton Improvement club
during the past ten days. Two differ
ent parties have met the business men
of the town relative to locating an
industry here and a third business is
under consideration. There seems to
be a good probability of locating one
or more of them which would lend con
siderable impetus to the growth of the
place. All propositions will be care
fully investigated before definite ac
tion is taken. The club is serving the
town in a aennite way in acting as"a
clearing house for propositions from
prospective manufacturing concerns.
Mrs. Louis Danne, nee Nellie Cas
sidy, who died in Chicago Tuesday

she went to Chicago where she en
gaged in business and was eminently
successful. Mrs. Danne was a sister
of the late James B. Cassidy, and Miss

ing her three years at the Northwest

CIVIL RIGHTS.
In order to stimulate your ex
ertions in favor bf your civil lib
erties, which protect religious
rights, instead of discoursing to
you on the laws of other states
and comparing them to our own,
allow me to tell you what your
civil liberties are and to charge
you, which I do in the most
solemn manner, to hold them
dearer than your lives a lesson
and a charge at all times proper
from a judge, but particularly so
at this crisis, when America is
in one general and grievous com
motion touching this truly im
portant point For my
part, in my judicial character, I
know no master but the law. I
am a servant, not to the king,
but to the constitution, and in
my estimation I shall best dis
charge my duty as a good serv
ant to the king and a trusty of
ficer under the constitution when
I boldly declare the laws to the
people and instruct them in their
civic rights. Judge William
Henry Drayton, South Carolina,
1774.

AND THE MAN.
Barton Academy and x
Graded School
The teachers in the academy are thi3
year located as follows : Sprague W.
Drenan, at the Crystal Lake House,
Miss Patrick at Hotel Barton, Miss
Ferrin and Miss Renfrew at John Cur-
j tis's, Miss Ruggles at the Mays', Miss
Peirpont at A. P. Underwood's, Miss
Cook at O. A. White's.
. The trustees of Barton academy and
graded school have opened to the pub
lic a school building in prime shape
for the reception of its pupils. Ever
since the school dosed - in June the
building has undergone a thorough
cleaning at the hands of Mr. Mudgett
and bis helpers. In all probability
surroundings more conducive to -the
health of the pupils are not to be found
anywhere. Parents may congratulate
themselves upon being able to send
their children to school where the
child's health and needs are considered
of paramount importance. Aside from
the congestion in the grades, a matter
which demands a speedy solution, the
school plant is well equipped for the
work of the year and in the hands of
an efficient corps of teachers.
Visitors for the week were Elsie
Young of Brownington, Roy Brahana
of Lowell, Julia King of Barton, Mary
Wilkinson, George Phillips of Glover.
