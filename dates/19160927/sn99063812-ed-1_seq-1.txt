ELECTORS WHO HAVE CHANGED
THEIR RESIDENCE SINCE PRN
MARY SHOULD NOTIFY COUN
TY CLERK BEFORE NOV. 7TH
To avoid trouble to voters on elec
tion day, County Clerk C. R. DeLap
Is colling the attention of the -voters
to tho fact that every voter must vote
In the precinct iu which he lives, and
that all voters who have moved their
resldtnce since the primary election
should notify the county clerk or any
other registration officer. -
This applies even to wards In
tow ns, says County Clerk DeLap. For
lurtance, If a voter lived In the Sec
ond Ward when he voted last spring,
but since has moved to the Third
Ward, he must vote In tho Third
Ward on November 7th. 'If he does
not notify a registration officer of his
change of residence, ho will find on
election day that bis name Is not on
the rolls of the Third Ward. He will
not be allowed to go to tho Second
Ward to voto, and before his name
can bo changed to tho Third Ward
rolls ho will experience much troublo
and loss of time.
Tho registration books will close at
C o'elock on the afternoon of October
Cth, and anyone not registered then
must be sworn In on election day.
