ANTI-SMOKING RULE CAUSES
MUCH DISTURBANCE ATP.H.S.
The aniisinoking viilc which was
made at the first of the school year
is proving to be a never ending ques
tion. Yesterday morning Superin
tendent Park asserted before the stu
dent body that he was only carrying
out the wishes of ihe school board
In enforcing the rule and further than
that had nothing to do with It. This
morning before the student body he
said that it was not his wish to give
the impression that the school bom.
had made the ruling but rather that
he had made the ruling himself and
had been backed up by the school
board. Mr. Park said that the ruling
was meeting with some opposition and
that some of the students were even
going so far as to declare that they
were not getting a square deal either
by the smoking rule or by any other
rulings made by himself or Mr. Drill. '
A big pep meeting was held this
morning at the high school for the
purpose of getting the student body'
behind athletics. Up to now there
has been little enthusiasm shown and
for that reason foojball has begun to
lug somewhat. The meeting was ta
ken up by talks and yells and enthu
siasm was fairly well aroused before
the meeting adjourned. Dr. Kern,
after having given a pep talk, sug
gested that as a form of physical cul
ture, military training be introduced
into the school. He asserted that the
government would furnish the rifles
and the suits would be furnished at a
low price. This, he said, would af
ford physical training for the stu
dent that would not b able to make
the athletic teams as well as to ths
athletes. This would be a prepared
ness measure as well as physical ex
ercise. The meeting altogether probably
did more to arouse enthusiasm than
anything yet tried, other ways ol
arousing enthusiasm will yet be trieu
und It Is hoped that the student bod
will be worked up to a high pitch be
fore long.
"Then there is the fact that v have
kept out of war and for this he is
rightly given the credit. T!ie republi
cans say his Mrxic: n policy is mis
taken, but they offer no substitute.
Taft Ieft Mexican Trouble.
"Incidentally he Inherited this Mex
ican trouble from Taft. who has also
Joined the ranks of his critics.
"Other big features which will con
tribute to the president's reelection
ue the S In ur day law and the chilo
labor law, both of which ;-.ppe.".l to
the humanitarian side of people and
both of which make for individual
and national efficiency.
"Another 'bit. step forward is the
i':ral credits law. the su.'ceis of which
nepends to a nrreat extent on the ee
sire of farmers to f.irvn nat.on il loin
associations. The blu point is that it
i"oides the machinery for lone time
loans and low vatos oi' inL -rest a
thing badly needed by oi.r a.crici lt'intl
population.
Moe Sax. former Jefferson h",'h
school football captain and half back
has decided to enter Walla Waila
high school instead of the Pendleton;
high school. This addition to the;
Walla Walla team will make lliatj
school one to be reckoned with for)
the northwest championship. Saxj
would have entered Pendleton high
school but decided that he could do
better In Walla Walla. As a result
of this loss, Pendleton will have to
some tall hustling to fill his place. ,
Mr. Park announced this morning
before assembly that student govern
ment would be tried in high school
As a starter the executive commltu
of the student body will be allowed to
I reside over the 5th period study room
If tho students do not overrun this,
privilege other freedoms will be al-l
lowed that heretofore were thought;
impossible. j
Mr. Park says that he is willing to,
meet the students half way In any of '
their underta kings. '

ONLY NINE DAYS
FOR REGISTERING
Mr. and Mrs. Voter, difl you
know that there are only nine
days left in which to register
for the national, state and conn-
ty election on Nov. 7. The last
date upon which voters may
register Is October 7 and there
are still several thousand vot-
ers in the county unregistered.
Those who registered for the
spring primaries do not have to
register again unless they have
moved Into another precinct
since the date of the primaries.
County Clerk Frank Sating states
that there arc only a few voters
registering eich day. Unless
there is a grand fin it rush, many
voters will find themselves un-
qualified to vote at the Noveni-
ber election.
ROUND-VP CROWDS
SPENT MORE THAN
IN SEVERAL YEARS
The crowd that attended the
(tound-l'p last week was the best
spending crowd that has been a: the
big show in several years, according
to reports received from local mer
chants Good crops and the general
prosperity had put money In their
pockets and they were ready to iy
for their good tlmo and for such mer
chandise as took therr fancy
One clothing merchant states that
the rtound-l'p business of last week
will make hi3 September receipts thia
year double that of last year. One
of the garage owners stated that he
did three times the volume of business
this year that he did last and one of
the cigar store proprietors reports his
Saturday business J100 better than
the Saturday business of the
week. And thus down the line, al!
buslneFS places make like reports.
It is difficult to estimate how much
money was left in the city during the
week by visitors but the amount will
run Into the many thousands.
