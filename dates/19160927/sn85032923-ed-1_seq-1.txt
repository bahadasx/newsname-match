EXECUTIVE SPEAKS AT
NATIONAL GRAIN DEAL-1
ERS' CONVENTION ON
IMPORTANT QUESTIONS
FACING BUSINESS MEN.
Dy Associated Press.
BALTIMORE, Sept. 25 President
Wilson delivered a speech almost de
void of politics before the National
Grain Dealers' convention here today.
He said that through the new tariff
commission, trade commission, Feder
al reserve act, and shipping bill he
expected the business men of the
country to open a new trade era for
the nation.
Speaking of Latin-America, he said
his chief concern had been to sec that
nothing had been done that would
show other than friendship and good
faith on our part. This statement was
greeted with prolonged ..appla'c. .
President Wilson discussed the
bureau of foreign and domestic com
merce and said it was an admirable
circumstance that brainy men were
willing to serve this commission
and the government for less than a
third of what they could earn else
where. He discussed the non-partisan
tariff commission and outlined
the aims of that body. Wilson en
deavored to eliminate politics from
the occasion but was greeted by a
great demonstration when he entered
the hall.

HUGHES REPLIES
TO WILSON'S
SHOWS PRESIDENT WAS
WRONG IN DECLARING
8-HOUR PRINCIPLE WAS
NOT ARBITRABLE.
By Associated 1 vrst.
D.VYTON, Sept. 25. Charles E.
Hughes, addressing an audience in
Memorial hall tonight, replied to the
statements in Wilson's speech Satur
day in connection with the passage of
the Adamson law. He said Wilson's
reference ic the SO-ccnt gas ane in
New York was not analagous. He said
the courts have nothing to do with
the questions of policy and legisla
tion and that only questions of con
stitutionality come before the courts.
Commenting on Wilson's declara
tion that the eight-hour principle was
not arbitrable, Hughes said that IS
vinr5 rio-n nn nrt nrovided fnr the nr- I
"bitration of hours of labor with other
things and that this was re-enacted in
1913. He protested against the cn-
dcavor to confuse thought by discus-'
sing the eight-hour day when nothing
of the sort was proposed. The only '
thing proposed, he said, was a change
in the wage schedule.
