DEATH OF WIFEJTIIRT OF IT
Drink Only Made Bigger the Del'

Which Came.
WRECK IS FINALLY COMPLETE
The Louisville Courier-Journal or
Sunday sas:
Grlevng for the wife whom death
had taken from him, and no longer
able to bear sight of the famillur
scenes of his happy man led life,
Manual Slaven, a farmer of Mitch
ell county, Kansas, sold all that ho
possessed and, with something more
than $3,000 and his eight children,
set out to find a new home six weeks
ago. He Journeyed through Indiana
and Ohio down to Florida and, find
ing no place that suited him, cam
northward again, arriving in Louls--vllle
Friday night. Four of the
children had been left behind at Per
nell, Fla., among them the 5-monthe-old
baby at whose birth the
" wife and mother died. Seven hun
dred dolla'rs already was gone In the
-fruitless search. Last night Slaven
was In the Jefferson county Jail, suf
fering from what the police believe
to be an opiate, the last penny of
his little fortune gone and his help
less children being cared for at tho
Dptnntlnn Home. Tho nollce believe.-
he was robbed late yesterday after
noon of his remaining $2,300 on
Grayson street in a negro resort,
"which they raided, arresting its four
inmates on charges of grand larceny.
The money was not recoveied. Tho
children, all under 12 years, were
found at the Tenth-street depot by
Mrs. Elizabeth M. Miles, the matron,
who cared for them until they were
removed to the home by the police.
When partly recovered from his
stupor, Slaven was seen at the Jail by
a leporter, to whom he told his
story. He Is 45 years old and a typ-
ieal Western farmer, with large
ire
BTa
"ack mustache and widc-brlnvmed
gray felt hat. He said he and his
Aife had lived happily and been
prosperous on their little farm near
qfcnelder, Mitchell county, Kas.,
about 100 miles west of Kansas City,
They had seven children imd tho
eighth, a boy, was horn April 1 the
mother dying at that time.
"Any man who loses his wife and
the faithful mother of his children,"
sobbed Slaven, "will know what I
suffered. As tho dajs and weeks
went on, I all but lost my mlnd I
couldn't stand it any longer. I
couldn't stay there and sec the
places where my wife used to be and
tho things she used to touch. I sold
everything and got a little more
than $3,000 together and then set
out to locate anywhere. I took tho
kids and we traveled through Indi
ana and Ohio, looking for a place to
M'ttle. But I couldn't bo suited. I
was crazy, I believe. So I went to
Florida.
"I didn't find things to suit mo
there, either. I never had been a
drinking man, but I trlod to drown
my grief in liquor and it mndo n
fool of mo. I got into bad company
ono night in Jacksonville, Fla., weut
tv hero I shouldn't and got robbed of
?400. When I staited north again,
thinking to settle, cither here in
Kentucky oroer In Indiana, I took
out $300 for traveling expenses and
bought n draft for $2,000 on a bank
at Perncll, Fin. I thought my mon
ey would bo safe that way. We got
in hero Friday night and tho child
len and I ttayed at a hotel. I only
brought four of them along w 1th mo.
My oldest girl she's 24 now stay
ed down In Pernell with tho llttlo
baby nnd the others and I was going
tsend for thorn when I got located,
J'rought Eddie nnd Ernest aud Em
ily and Ruby with me.
"Well, yesterday morning I ido
cldl that I wouldn't stay here and
so w) went down, to tho station to
catch a train over Into Indiana. I
"had been drjuklng a little and I
thought I would go' up into town
again until time for the train tct ;
leave. I left the children there with
the woman In the station and in
tended to come Tight back. I gueeu
KUUHLt
I got too much and thoso women
coaxed me into that house. When I
came out I went to a saloon to get
another drink. I started to pay tho
bartender and found tiiat all my
money, $300 In cash and the draft
for $2,000, wag gone. That's all I
know about It. I nover felt myself
being robbed. Now I'm without a
penny In the world, I don't know
where my children nre and I have no
one to go to for help."
Tho alleged robbery was reported
to Patrolmen Burnett and Swift,
who watch tho beat In which is in
cluded Grayson street. Guided by
Slaven, whom they had to walk to
keep conscious, they were led to u
negro resort on Grayson street near
Ninth.
There they arrested four negro
women, who gave their names as Es
sie Jones, 17 years old; Katie Thom
as, 17; Lula Yeager, 24, and Ollle
Bryant, 25, and they were charged
with lohbery.
Slaven was arrested on a charge
of disorderly conduct. Tho women
deny the charge.
Mrs. Miles, the matron at the de
pot, became perplexed about the
continued presence of the four little
children In the station. She called
the police, who had them removed
to the Detention Home, where they
weie given a warm supper and, af
ter crying for their father, finally
fell asleep. The children's ages aro
as follows: Edward, 11 years old.
Ernest 7, Emily 5 and Ruby 3. The
police still are working on the case
and hope to locate the money and
draft.

FORM
In Kentucky To Uphold
President Wilson.
MRS. MAUS IS AT HEAD DP IT
Defends Its Policies and De
clares Country Needs His
Reflection.
A WOMAN'S STRONG COMMENT
A woman's "Democratic Wilson
Progressive Club" has been organiz
ed among .women of Kentucky as n
counter-balancing influence (.o th
Hughes Woman's Alliance. The or
ganisation was effected at Frankfort
last week. Mis. L. M. Mnus was
made permanent chairman and .Mrs.
George Chlun secretary.
An efforti will be made to form
chapters In a number ot towns In
the State.
One of the points made at the
meeting was that the suffragists
know that Wilson went to his home
In New Jeisey to vote for woman's
suffrage, while Hughes has never
voted for the Issue he has only an
nounced for It.
Mis. Maus, In a brief address,
commented upon the many wonder
ful achievements of Wilson's admin
istration, and exptessed the convic
tion that, to a woman and a mother,
his great humanitarianlsm makes
the greatest appeal.
Few neonle realize, she said, tho
amount of commercialism in war.
The aggressive, insistent and often
abusive Individuals and corpoia
tlons, who have "axes to grind;"
thoso who deal In ships, guns, am
munition and mules, as well as some I
high-ranking officers of the army,
who are willing to spill the blood of j
the oung men of the countiy In or
der to attain wealth and promotion.!
weie all cited as influences which
beset President Wilson in dealing
with the Mexican situation. In thh
connection Mrs. Maus said: "Let
us look at the result of this splen
did, wise policy we are so piosper
ous that we aie the bread basket of
the world, and Demociats and Re
publicans alike aie enjoying this
piospeilty for the Lord sends rain
alike upon the Just and unjust. This
same prosperity has enabled us to
help millions of Innocent, suffering
people, whose uilers were not ns
wise or as humble as ours, and who
are paying the price of pride, urro
gauce and stupidity."
Mrs. Mnus, who is the wife of
Col. L. M. Maus, .Medical Depart
ment, U. S. A., letired, refeired to
the Spanish-America war In defensa
of the non-war policy. She express
ed a personal conviction that there
was not sufficient cause for that war.
It so happened that "Mrs. Maus was
in tho Whtto House with Mrs. Mc
Kiuley when Sccretaiy of War Al
ger nnnouueed that the President
ha'd Just signed the declaration ot
war. She said:
"There was nothing really au
thentic as to who had blown up tho
Malno. Gen. Lee's jnlde had been
wounded and his friends wished him
to return to Cuba with an at my at
his back, but It was the yellow Jour
nals and contractors which persuad
ed our lovely, gentlo President that
war was necessary, and ho told me
tlntt he had every assurance that It
would all be over In three or tour
months. Little did ho realize what
It would mean to our country, even
shoit and bloodless as It was."
In discussing the notion of tho
Ptesldeut regarding the recent rail
road strike, Mrs, Maus said that ho
had been actuated by a desire to
servo the masses of tho people. She
cited the horrors of a strike from an
expetlenco in Chicago soveral years'
ago during tho stilke ot tho shirt
waist makei8.
In concluding her address, Mrs.
Maus said:
"It) Is Hie far-reaching foresight
of our wonderful President which
flllfi us with admiration when wo
feel ho Is not only a benefactor to
Americans but to the whole human
race. Upon one occasion I met hW
daughter, then Miss Jessie Wlsou,
nnd when I expressed the fear that
her father might overtax his
Btrength, she answeied very quietly,
'Father Is not depending on bis own
Btrength these days,' and, Christian
women of our land, this Is tho se
cret ot his marvelous administration
which will go down in history as by
far the greatest that our country
has ever enjoyed.
"After this war Is over there v. Ill
bo many complications nnd difficult
problems to adjust. Conditions will
nrlse which Mr. Wilson alone can
Bottle for us, owing to his exception
al knowledge of diplomacy and obli
gations, nnd I know of no greater
calamity than not to have him con
tinue In offlce. I have no fear for
the woman's question of equal
rights He conies of a stock of peo
pie who always do a little better
than they promise. He Is not a
promising man In this sense, but at
the right moment we will Unci hint
Just where he should be. aud our
friend. No other man can fill hl
place at this Important time In the
world's history, so let everv woman
who values her sons and her lium
rally to his standard and be tiuc to
him and to herself."

In China By Almost Un
precedented Floods.
FRIGHTFUL RUIN IS WROUGHT
Area Of About Seven Thousand
Square Miles In Anhui
Province Flooded.
NEARLY A MILLION DEMITiTE
Washington, Sept. 2 5. Nearly a
million People have oeen made
homeless by one of tne greatest
floods on record In that section of
China where the American Red
Cross already has spent $000,00(1
for flood piotection, and where the
530,000,000 loan for reclamation
work, which was postponed by the
war, was to have been spent. Re
ports to the State Department from
the American Consul at Nanking
Bald the Hvval river had inundated
an area of about 7,000 square miles
lu Anliul Piovlnce. Appeals for aid
have been sent out for the homeless,
who virtually are entirely dependent
on charity, as all the autumn cropd
were destroyed.
The flood occurred in a very flat,
alluvial section, where the north-to-south
passage of the Grand Canal
had dammed up a large lake aud
allowed the Hwai liver too llttlti
space to carry oft the excess of wa
ter. The State Department summed up
Its dispatches on the subject In the
following announcement:
"The Department has received
from the American Consul at Nan
king dispatches giving detailed in
formation regarding recent extensive
Hoods along the Hwai river in Anhui
Province. The inundation is equal
to, if not greater, than the one ot
1909. An area of some 2.0UU
square miles was submersed undr
three to fifteen feet of water, and
fioni July 11 to July 21 the waters
reached such a height as to sub
merge all except 'very high ground
In an area estimated at 7, "00 square
miles.
"The flood extended throughout
eight districts In Northern Anhui.
There are ten cities of considerable
size in these eight dlstiicts, with a
total population estimated at from
4.00,(01 to 1,000,000 people. The
total population of the flooded re
gion Is approximately 2,500,000 peo
pie.
"While It Is thought that eompai
atlvely few lives were lost, crops
and personal property have been de
ft royed and there are thousands of
e'estitute people, nearly all of whom
are now objects of charity."
In the great flood of 1909, nearly
1,000,000 lives weie lot. Soon af
teiward C. D. Jameson, an American
engineer, was sent to China to work
out a reclamation system. In 1911
Colonel Sleher. of the Panama Ca
nal, headed a Red Cross Commis
sion, w hlch approvedJnineson's plans,
nnd the Chinese Government begun
arrangements ror a $30,000,000 loan
to put them Into offect The Euro
pean war, however, made it Impossi
ble to raise the capital.

( ll tho Equity Man )
Our farmers are saving their pea
vine hay nnd It Ih fine and abundant.
f
From the amount of work tho av
eias?e fanner does, he ought to ho
"big rich." They cat bieaktait l
lamp light und eat supper by lamp
light, which means that they work
about 1IJ hours in every 24. And
yet the furmers as a class get le3i
returns for thtlr labor than any oth
er class. The best evidence of this
Is the fact that 4 0 pel cent, of the
fanners of the United States arj
tenant farmers. Come with the So
ciety of Equity and let u.s help you
get nu S-hour day for the farm.
Ohio county schoolhouses look
good to us. They are all neatly
painted and comfortably seated. Her
county churches also show up well
in this respect These are signs on
the highway of civilization.
Our so-called statesmen rave and
rant about "child labor;" thoy say
the child In the towns and Citle.1
shall not be dwarfed by doing tho
labor that men Jshould do. Have
you ever heard one object to child
labor on the farm? Not much; They
don't care a "continental" how
hard or how long the farmer boy
and girl have to work. Why? Just
because you fellows on the farm are
unorganized. You have been satis
fied to remain as Individual unita
and are, as a political force, not to
be dreaded. Show those fellows In
Washington that you are organized
and standing together like the work
ers who compose the American Fed
eration of Labor, and see them walk
before you with uncovered heads,
lending all the time a listening ear
to your call and command. If 400,
000 labor votes can force an 8-hour
day law In six days, what could 12,-
000,000 voters do In ten days?
The Equity Man was a watchful
attendant at the fair. The stock ex
hibit Aas good, but otherwise the
agricultural exhibit was not what it
should have been. I saw two exhib
its of pears, ono the Le Conte, a
splendid and perhaps the most val
uable species of the pear family for
shipping purposes. This came from
the orchard of Mr. James Cecil, near
town. The other was the Kelfer
pear, same species as the Le Conte
except a late hearing fruit. Both
were line samples.
