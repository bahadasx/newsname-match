PLAN TO "BOIL DOWN"
TEN COMMANDMENTS
How the Ten Commandments Look Boiled Down
Thou shall have no other God before me.
1 I
Thou shall not make lo thyself any graven image.
'Thou shall not idly 1...0* the name Jahz-eh thy God, 1
Thou shall remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
Thou shall honor thy father and thy moth f.
Thou shall not murder.
'Thou shall not commit adultery.
'Thou shall not steal.
'Thou shalt not bear false *.-. I/ness against thy neighbor.
Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's house.
Now get out your Bible and sec how God handed down the ten commandments to
Moses.
(Newspaper Enterprise Association.)
NEW YORK, Sept 27.—SHALL THE TEN COMMANDMENTS BR BOILED
DOWN?
Shall the words of God, which were written on tables of stone when the great prophet
Moses was living, thousands of years ago*--anl which have guided man through all ages—
NOW be made to conform with "modern" ideas?
For THIS is exactly wliat faces tlie religious people of America today 1
In St. Louis, next month, the convention of the Protectant Episcopal church is going to
consider a pfopoul to REVISE the commandment! 1
And, from present reports, it is likely that the propped will carry, despite the opposi
tion already encountered in many quarters to what is being termed by many as "a sacrileg
ious proceeding."
But the Episcopalian clergy view this nutter of boiling down God'l ten commandments
in a very different, in fact in a very matter-of-fact, light!
Rev, Herbert M. Denslow, rector of noteifd professor of pastoral theology at the Gen
eral Theological seminary, presents these as the generally accepted arguments rOR the "re
vision."
"Tlie plan is," he says, "to shorten tbe farm of the ten commandments as used in the
Episcopal church service. It should be'remeiw.ered that tbe commandments themselves ap
pear in different forms in the scriptures.
"Those 'who advocate this change believe that the ten commandments *wffl gain in
EMPHASIS, if shortened. They say thai BRFA'ITY constitutes the chief strength of
most precepts. And so many have dcclarel that God's ten commandments would be
more powerful if recited in the form of simple commands 'with the REASONS eliminated.
"A vote at tbe coming convention to adopt this change will be only a vote of recommenda
tion, however. Tbe project then must hold over three years, and not be acted upon perma
nently until the following convention three years hence. So there will be a great deal of dis
cussion before any real change in tbe form of tlie ten commandments is actually possible."

Dear Cynthia Grey:
I want to come to you for ad
vice. 1 am a divorced woman.
My husband wanted his freedom
and 1 gave It to him.
Now other men make life a
burden to inc.
1 am frank spoken but I am an
honest, good woman.
1 am willing to work hard for
my living, all 1 ask is to be let
alone.
Is It possible that 1 will have
to kill one of these brutes?
1 like to help the unfortunate,
and for thanks 1 get Insulted and
am told that the person thought
I was soliciting.
Before I was divorced I follow
ed the dictates of my own heart,
hut now I cannot. People tell
me to meet other men and try
to forget my trouble. Will you
tell roe how I am going to meet
any when at every turn I am met
with an Insult?
Perhaps the best way out would
be to go to some man and sell
inyootf to him for the protection
cf his name.
You may publish this If you
wish and my name also. 1 am
not afraid to stand by what 1 ha.c
aaid.
