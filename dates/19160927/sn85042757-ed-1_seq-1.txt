600D ROADS DISCUSSION.
Mr. Converse Talks of the Drag and
the Wide Tire.
Editor Chronicle :
I notice recently in the Chronicle
you praising the recent work done on
the graded road west of Crossville;
namely, the working of this road with
the road machine in such a way as to
put from 4 to 8 inches of dirt in the
road at once.
This is a mistake. We will never
have good graded roads as long as we
neglect them from 12 to 15 months,
then put 6 inches of dirt up at once.
Since Cumberland county is on her
way to graded roads why cannot or
will not the county paper advocate the
only things that will make such roads
satisfactory and permanent: the drag
and the wide tire.
The drag should be used after each
rain, if possibSe, and if used the ma
chine will never be needed for the drag
will bring tne dirt to the middle ot the
road in small quantities and it will
pack and the road will become hard.
I don't want to argue this statement ;
it is a tact and has been demonstrated
thousands of times.
It will not make roads equal to con
crete or macadam, but will keep our
roads passable for motors 12 months
each year.
The wide tire will work hand in hand
with the road builders and are unpop
ular only Dy those who have never tried
them. Those who have used wide tires
are loud in their praise.
I would compel wide tires on our
graded roads by a law, for one wide
tire and one hundred narrow tires will
not make a road, but will likely be a
hardship oo the team hitched to the
wide tire.
Such a law could allow time to wear
out or put on wide tires and at the ex
piration of that time put a tax on all
wagons i hat appear on the roads not
complying with the proper width ot
tire.
This law coolo tax at once all new
wagons brought into the county, which
do not comply with the provisions of
tne wide tire law.
It is hard to make such a change, out
when made it will help all. Such a
change will mean good graded roads
and as we are to have graded roads it
will mean GOOD ROADS.
The old system of narrow tires and
infrequent workings have been tried
on our hrst graded roads and failed,
for the roads become impassable in
winter and are each year becoming
more sandy and heavier draft.
It if a fact that teams that drew do
ties when the weBtend ot the road was
new are taking only about 22 this sum
mer
Th Avnenditure of our bond money
will not give us good roads unless we
take care of the road after building.
Some force must be set to work to
make this change. Is the Chronicle
able to take this stand for REALLY
BETTER ROADS?
Yours truly.
J. E. Converse.
(It Mr. Converse had been an attend
ant at the meetings of the Cumberland
County Business Association he would
know that this association has had the
question of the upkeep of our roads un
der consideration for some time, that a
committee has been appointed to draft
a law and the question of wide tires
has been unanimously nccepted by ev
ery member of the association, so tar
as the writer is aware. The Editor of
the Chronicle is heartily in sympathy
with the wide tire idea now and always
has been, but did not feel that the
right time had arrived for discussing
if m tha columns of this paper.
We certainly favor the idea ot the
HrD that Mr. Converse mentions, and
the more frequently it is run over the
mAHs the better we will be pieasea
We only meant to commend work that
was done as against the attitude mai
has
prevailed of doing nothing, we
have
fAnnii lona aero that it is oiten
tun shortest route to what you really
want to praise the thing that is half
done, when it leads in tne direction of
u -mi vooiiv want. Working the
YVuat jrvu
road with the machine is a step in the
right direction, but it is far from what
is really needed. We agree witn mr
Converse that the proper and often use
of the road drag will render the use of
monhiiu nimoat unnecessary. As
title u'".
for the wide tire, we think they are
the only route to good roads, when
coupled with the proper use of the ma
chine and drag. There is no real dis
agreement between this editor and Mr
Converse when we come to understand
each other, but these discussions some
times are helpful to clarity the real
ooint of view held by people who might
seem to dirfer.-Eaitor Chronicle.)
E TO THE FAIR;
YOU WILL BE GLAD
Products of Cumberland County Will Be
On Display Next Friday and $300
In Premiums Awarded In the
Several Departments.
Friday and Saturday the County
Fair will be held here in Crossville and
premiums amounting to close to $300
will be given to the fortunate winners.
The premiums are so arranged and
graded that there will be an excellent
opportunity for a multitude of winners
as there are about 300 premiums otter
ed. Never before have the farmers of
the county reaped such abundant crops
in general as this year. There have
been times when some crops have been
considerably better, but in such years
there has been almost a failure in some
certain crops, which made the genera)
average of crops lower than this year.
At no previous time have our people
given such close and careful attention
to farming and better breeds of stock
as this year. For that reason there
promises to be the best display ever
made not only of vegetables and grains
but of live stock and poultry as well.
Indication 1 now point to a very large
attendance 1 1 the people generally in
this county : i d an unusual attendance
from other mnties. We learn that
Clitty, just i fei the White county line,
will be on bond with a splendid array
of farm preuuets. They will be heart
ily welcomed and accorded every cour
tesy.
The Crossville band will furnish
music during both days of the Fair and
there will be a good show at the Mecca
Theatre. All in all the chance lor a
jolly good time has never seemed so
good as at the coming Fair this week
Friday and Saturday.
If you miss attending this fair the
chances are you will always regret it
and you are almost sure to miss such a
lesson in many ways cs would be worth
many times what it will cost you to at
tend. Every person in the county should
not only feel it a duty but. a pleasure
as well to attend the fair at least one
day Come and bring something to
exhibit and you may secure a premium
worth far more than the time you lose
in coming.
CHRISTIAN WORK.
Monday of last week G. L. Wilt, of
Pomona, was taken to Nashville to be
operated upon for something of a drop
sical nature. Doctors drew a large
amount of water from his side and
waited tor hiui to gain sufficient
strength to proceed with other opera
tions. He returned home much im
proved and now expects to by able to
attend to his farm work as usual soon.
On Sunday, before Mr. Wilt
was taken to Nashville, some of his
neighbors hauled in 20 loads of hay he
had down and was unable to look ti
ter. Jas. Dayton and two sons went
with a team, Ed Campbell, James
Campbell and Joe Myers made up the
company that did the work. Rev.
Robt. Hall came along and proffered
his assistance to save the hay, but the
men told him they had all th force
tney could use and he went on to Clays
ville to his preaching appointment
Rev. Hall made it very clear that he
considered such work ot tne vry nign
est Christian character in spite of the
day being the Sabbath.
Some people are inclined to condemn
such a thing as working on Sunday, it
matters little what the conditions are.
From our point of view such things are
marks ot the very best citizenship and
the highest Christian conduct.
O. E. S. CaLL MEETING.
All members of Amanda Chapter, O.
E. S., are requested to meet at the
Masonic Hall today (Wednesday) at 2
p. m, for practice. The Grand uec
turer, Past Grand Matron Ophelia Al
len, is expected here shortly and it is
desired to make proper preparation tor
receiving her.

SENTENCED TO THE PEN.
J. S. Watson Denied New Trial on a 3
to 15 Year Sentence.
J. S. Watson was denied a new tria
before Judge Gardenhire, at Cooke
ville, last week in a case wherein he
had been sentenced to the peaitentiary
for from three to fifteen years for hav
ing been implicated in uttering a
forged deed. The case has been or will
be appealed to the stat supreme court
and the execution ot the sentence will
be stayed until after the highests court
of the state has passed upon it.
0ur information touching the case is
as follows: J. H. Absfon and C. H.
Abston forged a deed covering a cer
tain tract ot land in Putnam county
owned by J. H. and Lewis Johnson.
The Johnsons were forced to bring suit
in the chancery court of Putnam coun
ty to restrain the Abstons from cutting
the timber from the land, which I hey
eutered upon after having the forged
deed recorded in Putnam county. By
the suit brought by the Johnsons the
deed was shown to be fraudulent and it
developed that J. S. Watson had atl
tempted to assist in carrying out the
fraud by acting as attorney tor the
Abstons. The deed was acknowledged
before J. F. Brown, at Crab Orchard,
when he was justice ot the peace, but
it was shown that the person who ex
ecuted the deed and called himself Sam
Eastland, was a fraud and did not own
the land and that tne Abstons knew
that fact at the time the deed was
made and acknowledged before J. F
Brown, then an acting justice of the
peace. The Abstons were convicted
and are now in the penitentiary.
J. S. Watson appeared in court as
the attorney ot the Abstons and urged
the iorged deed ae a valid title under
which to hold the land. It seems that
sufficient evidence developed to satisfy
the jury that Watson had full knowl
edge that the deed was a forgery and
on that grounds the jury returned a
verdict of guilty and Watson was sen
tenced at the June term. He made
application for a new trial, which ap
plication was heard by Judge Garden
hire and the new trial denied. As
above stated, the case will have to be
heard by the state supreme court be
fore actual execution of the sentence
can take place.
W. F. Bandy was in Cookeville on
business one day last week.
Mr and Mrs. Paul R. Queen, who
recently lett Pleasant Hill to attend
Piedmont College, at Demorest, Ga.,
report that school has opened with an
increased attendance of about one hun
dred and fifty. Piedmont College is
one of the growing colleges of the
South. There are several Ple&sant
Hill students in Demorest and bo maiiv
hole Etate that a Tennessee
Club has been organized.
If you want score cards and pencils,
paper napkins, nice writing paper cut

I). F. Southard left Sunday tor
Greensboro, A la., to look after his lum
ber business there.
Marshal Hill Lowrey is grading Main
street and trying to fix the section
near the depot so it will not be a stand
ing mud hole this winter. His purpose
is right but the course is wrong.
Nothing will avail except a paved
street done in a good and substantial
way. Time will demonstrate the fore
going statement to be true.
Another teachel $as been added to
the force in the City schools. Miss
Elizabeth Snow has been engaged to
each half a day to relieve the heavy
work upon Mrs. C. E. Keyes, who had
nearly 150 students counting both fore
noon and afternoon attendance. Miss
Snow is a competent teacher and the
results are sure to prove mucn Dener
with the two capable instructors than
could have been possible with only
one.
BROADSIDE ORATORY..
Next Monday, October 2, there will
be fifty democratic speakers making
the "welkin ring" at as many points
from "Carter to Shelby," in behalf of
the democratic ticket, state and na
tional. Crossville is not to be one of
the points where democratic oratory
ill be poured forth in such profusion,
but Hon. Terry Abernathy, Repubilcan
candidate for railroad commissioner,
will tell the people of Cumberland
county of the beauty and greatness ot
republicanism. Come and hear him ;
it will be worth your while.
Political Jottings.
The Houston Post reasons that It
was easier for Its own beloved De
mocracy to endorse the President's
Mexican policy than to define It.
While he was about It Senator
James Hamilton Lewis also might
have explained that the Rome that
was "too proud to fight" died a rather
disastrous death.
"In all fairness," asks the Boston
Transcript, "shouldn't the expense of
financing Carranza be borne by the
Democratic campaign committee?"
Democrats really haven't any ob
jection to big appropriations for army
and navy and internal Improvements.
They expect the Republicans to rustle
the revenue to foot the bills for the
next four years.
Hughes says he would like six
months to Investigate the Administra
tion, but the Administration figures
he's doing very well as It is.
Yes, and the same policies that have
filled Judge Hughes and others with
"a deep sense of shame," have sent
many other Americans to their graves.
The President has changed his mind
about sending more troops to the bor
der, thus running true to form.
When Tom Taggart talks economy
to them, it Is time the Democrats
stopped their extravagance.
The Hughes smiie Is beginning to
attract favorable attention.
President Entertains Five Progres
sives. Headline. Others he simply
amuses.
Democratic papers chide Hughes be
cause he says, he Is "100 per cent, a
candidate." The Wilson papers nat
urally prefer a fifty-fifty candidate.
The President says he has no Inter
est In any political party, "except as
an Instrument of achievement." If
that's it. then how did he happen to
select such a poor Instrument ns the
Democratic party?
Carranza Isn't a candidate for Presi
dent of the United States, but he did
more for American preparedness In
three weeks than Woodrow Wilson did
In three years.
Another thing you never hear of
since the Democrats reduced the cost
of living Is the "baker'.s dozen."
Mr. Hughes is criticized for his fre
quent use of the word "Now." Evi
dently his immedlateness is worrying
the watchful waiters who put things
off until tomorrow.
Fnnrilies living in rural districts
where mnil service has been curtailed
will be interested in knowing that
Postmaster Gencrr.l Burleson has sent
Secretary McAdoo a check for S.r),200,
000, representing surplus postal rev
enues. Mr. Gardner should not quote what
Mr. Wilson said while president of
Princeton. His utterances are outlaw
ed by himself In seven days.
That man Hughes is causing the
Democratic newspapers an endless
amount of worry. Apparently they
will never be satisfied until he turns
the management of his campaign over
to them.
Mr. Hughes' speeches are giving
poor satisfaction to the Democratic
press, which proves they are very
geod speeches, Indeed.
Secretary Baker is developing an
agility in changing his mind that must
endear him to his discoverer.
Mr. Wilson's Administration must
confess itself Incompetent in one re
spect or the other. It either has ap
propriated for an unneeded navy or
It has neglected a needed navy. It
can select its fault to suit Itself. In
one respect or the other it must be
wrong.
"I believe in efficiency In politics
Just as much as in anything else,"
says Mr. Hughes. Efficiency is an
excellent watch-word, and its use in
the campaign is merely a forerunner
of its use in the White House whea
he get there.
ABERNATHY TO SPEAK.
Will Open His Campaign for Railroad
Commissioner, Against the Present
Encumbern, BAEnloe. Mon
day, Next, October 2.
Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 26 Special
Terry Abernatny, Republican candi
date for railroad commissioner, opens
his campaign at Crossville, Monday,
Oct. 2. From that time to the eve of
the election he will wage a stringent
tight for the commissionership, which
he seems to have won already.
Mr. Abernathy, a lawyer, educator
and one of the most prominent of the
younger republicans of Tennessee, will
make speeches over the district, advo
cating the national and state ticket, as
well as his own candidacy. He is a
good speaker, a conservative, energetic
campaigner, and there seems to be no
doubt of his election. He reports con
ditions most favorable in McNairy, his
home couunty. He spent two days at
headquarters this week, and further
speaking dates will be announced soon.
FORCING THE FIGHT.
Chairman J. Will Taylor's reply to
the statement of Treasurer Wills of
the Democratic Headquarters, is caus
ing much comment among the Demo
crats as well as Republicans, due to
the fact that Mr. Will's statement:
"The Republicans have brought the
fight to our very doors, etc," is a prac
tical admission that democrats are
feeling the opposition more than ever
before in their state campaigns.
Mr. Taylor said : "The statement of
Treasurer Wills soundH like an echo
from old Spartacus of Rome. While
this statement of Treasurer Wills is a
little bit spectacular and dramatic,
however we do not intend to stop at
the door : we are going in and take
possession f the house with all of its
contents and appurtenances. Treas
urer Wills has evidently had his ear to
the ground and heard the rumblings of
the coining Kepublican victory in No
vember."
MANY SPEAKERS.
A battery of Republican orators from
East Tennessee will take the field at
an eaily date in support of the state
and national tickets. Among the men
selected to campaign, and whose dates
will be announced later, are: Gen.
James A. Fowler, Gen. D. A. Vines,
Maj. Paul E. Devine, Judge II. Tyler
Campbell, Sam Price, Hon. T. A.
Wright, Judge H. P. Lindsey, H. Clay
Evans, John H. Early, Foster V.
Brown, and others to be announced
lui-cr Alt' A. Tavlor and Col. A. M.
Hughes will take the stump later.
MANY VISITORS.
Prominent Republicans from, every
district in the state have been pouring
into headquarters at Nashville for sev
eral clays. During the state fair last
week at least 300-called at the offices
ot the executive committee, and the
most flattering reports yet received
have been absolutely verilied by the
many visitors who come irom every
section of Tennessee and represent ev
ery walk ot life.
johnW Overall, candidate for gov
ernor, began a three days' tour of Bed-
lord, Rutherford and Marshall coun
ties on Tuesday, making the campaign
in his automobile, accompanied by John
Trotwood Moore, and members of the
press.
The success ot the National ticket
siands out like a bam on a wire The
campaign of Mr. Hughes is naving a
ling effect, and hia unlimited attack,
backed by facts, on President Wilson,
is getting blood every day. The re
suits in Maine, the vote in New York,
and the heavy fire of opposition, is
about to crumble tlie Democratic
bteastworks. It seerm certain now,
troin all reports, that Hughes and P'air
banks will win, on November 7, one of
the greatest of Republican victories
yet accorded the grand old party.
