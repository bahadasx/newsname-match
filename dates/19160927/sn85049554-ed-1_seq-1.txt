mans by the victorious Franco-
British forces on the So(mme front
The British capture of the
stronghold of Thlepval, following
closely and unexpectedly upon the
capture of Combles by the com
bined allied forces, was followed
up last night by a new stroke on
the part of the French south of the
Somme, where they drove, out from
Vermandovillers and captured a
strongly fortified wood east of the
town of Chaulnes.
Apparently this new drive is aim
ed at Chaulnes, which bears to the
southern end of the Somme line
somewhat the relation that Combles
did to the northern sector. The be.
ginning of a French effort to pocket
this othsr'German stronghold was
apparent some time ago.
Meanwhile the military impor
tance from the gains from Thlep
val to the 'Somme scored in the
smashing offensive of the present
& week are expected by military ob
servers in the entente capitals to be
-u made manifest by a speedy further
,Inroad upon German-held territory.
The French advahce beyond Bouch
avesnes is pointed to' as directly
threatening Allaines, two miles
ij north of fMWiM, and preparing

Edward Lautsrbach in 18 Years.
New York, Sept. 27.—Edward A. Leet,
42 years old. an Inventor, accused by

Most Picturesque Incident of Great
Somme Offensive—Allies Gains Reach
Six Miles in Depth.
British Front !n France, Sept. 27.—
The capture of Combles was one of the
most picturesque incidents in the
whole course of the great Somme of
fensive. it marked the opening of
yesterday's forward surge of the Brit
ish and French forces which reached
its climax in the capture of Gueude
court and Thlepval.
All night long bitter fighting had
been In progress at various points on
the front and with the dawn the Battle
broadened to include the whole BritlsH
left. Combles fell as the sun rose on
a perfect summer day.
Sitting in the midst of a group of
hilly the town was isolated yesterday
by the seizing! of the high ground on
either side by the French and British,
In the early hours of the morning
the British took an orchard in the out
skirts and then they charged the
trenches on the edge of the village. At
the same time the French, dashing
forward on the other side of the vil
lage, pushed triumphantly forward to
the heart of the village.
Ih the main street the soldiers of the
two nations met, joyously calling to
each other "Parlez Vou^' and "Howdy
yfaye do."
Late Resistance Feeble.
One of the most striking features of
the fighting last .night and today wa*
the surprisingly slight resistance of
fered at Morval and Combles by the
Germans, according to all reports made
by the British officers. The Germans
made the usual counter attacks against
the new BHtish positions last night
but they lacked, spirit.
In some instances the allied com
manders stated that considerable
bodies of Germans threw down their
rifles promptly when the attackers
reached their trenches, altbo It was
known .they- had orders to st
n1 tfleif attacic.
found the strongest defense made In
front of Giieudecourt. There the Ger.
nl§ns used their machine guns with*
the tenacity and unyielding courage
which has hitherto characterised them.
The British resumed the attack' yes
terday and today all the village is in
their possession.
Big Guns Withdrawn,
Both today and yesterday the Ger
mans showed an Inclination to with
draw their guns immediately they were
In any danger, evidently desiring to
take no risk of losing any of their ar
tillery. This sometimes leaves their
troops in the front line unprotected by
cannon fire and may account for the
number Of surrenders.
Since the offensive began the British
have taken nineteen villages and at
some points their gains now are six
miles in depth. Elation over today's
and yesterday's work is greatest at the
casualty clearing stations where the
red cost of victory is best measured.

Bucharest, Sept. 27.—Details of the
great battle on the Dobrudja front,
which ended, according to General

and a desperate battle was begun
stretching from the Danube to the
Black Sea.
"The -fighting opened on the Danube,
where enemy columns, Consisting
mostly of Germans, endeavored to
force their way into Chernavoda. This
effort was defeated by the Rouman
ians, who with repeated bayonet at
tacks. supported by the fire of three
monitors In the river, brought the ad
vance of the enemy to a standstill...
"in two days fighting Of. the most
desperate character, the enemy suf
fered heavy losses, his massed forma
tion being mowed down by artillery
fire. In the center he was driven from
trenches which he momentarily occu
pied.
^Finally at 9 o'clock in the evening
of Sept. 17, the enemy onslaught
reached its climax. The allies by a
formidable counter attack overthrew
the enemy's right wing, which fled.
The enemy losses were great. Every

In front of one division alone 5,000 rifles
were picked up. The allied troops

The: contestants might be willing to
begin Oct. 8, but I-hardly think so.
The American League race closes one

not think that would be fair to the
National League winner.
"Owing to the uncertainty of the
race, we have been unable to make any
arrangements for the series, and I
don't know whether to start east or re

have a chance, but of course In the
National League the winner will be an
eastern team."
