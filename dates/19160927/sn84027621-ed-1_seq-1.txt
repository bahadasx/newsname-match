Combles and Thiepval Taken Chaul
nes Fiercely Attacked and the En
tire Teuton' Front on the Somme
Expected to Crumble.
(Associated Press)
London, Sept. 27. The Germans
are tying given no rest on the Somme
front. The British capture of Thiep
val following closely the capture of
Combles, was followed last night, by
a French drive out of Vermandovil
lers apparently aimed at Chaulnes, an
effort to surround which has been ap
parent for some time.
-Entente military observers expect
me importance of the . recent gains
will be made manifest by further in
roads on German-held territory. The
French drive beyond Vervandovillers
is pointed to as threatening Allaines
and preparing the way for an encir
cling movement to drive the Germans
out of Peronne.
TOOK SEVERAL THOUSAND TEU-
Between three and four thousand
prisoners were taken by the British capture of vital significance. Corn
Monday and Tuesday on the Somme bles differed from all the villages in
front, it was announced today.
CAPTURE OF COMBLES
Combles, the pivotal point in the
German line guarding the approach to
Bapaume on the north, and Peronne
on the south of the Somme front, fell
yesterday evening before the terrific
attacks of the French and British, the j
Germans fighting to the death or sur
rendering when there wa3 no longer
hope.

by the allied forces since the com-1

tions they held and sought to conquer
In the team play of the blue French
legions and the khaia clad brigades ot
Britain were comprehensible to tne
eye in the glorious ' autumn sunlight
for a sweep of ten miles. The scene
had the intoxication of war's gran-deur-rMf
war can be said to have any
grandeur,
Tonight the British have taken half
of Morval, all of the Lee Boeuf and
have advanced their line on a front of
3,000 yards for an average depth of
1,000 yards; the French have stormed
Rancourt and have pushed their , line
to 'the outskirts of the village of
Fregicourt, a mile east and a little
north of Combles. The German strong-
hold of Combles is viitually isolated.
The correspondent of the Associat-
ed Press went forward yesterday over
the ridge in the Devil's wood and
Ginchy region which the British had
f ought for over two months to gain.
He walked for two miles through an
area which reverberated to the blasts
of the great guns, picking his way
between the bursts of flame and
crashing pieces, and moving around
the rows of cannon as one who seeks
a ford in a stream. On the other side
of the ridge he saw guns where he
had never seen them before, on the
promised land of the lower levels
which the British had won by per
sistent siege work. The guns were
! close up to the British infantry who
listened to their thunderous chorus as
'hey poured out fire after fire in the
ay's attack. -.

Feeding the Insatiable Guns
On his return the correspondent de-
cided he would not pass through that
wilderness of British guns of all sizes
and caliber while he had any hearing
left. Everyone of them was firing at
top speed. He chose a gallery which
took him many miles past those pour
ing out into the raging tempest of
gunfire. From the ruins Of Somme
old German trenches, whence the bat
tle panorama stretched before him the
correspondent had a near view of the
French gunners who were feeding
shells into the gunbreeches as grain
is fed into the threshing machines,
and with the mechanical precision of
automatons.
Shortly after noon was the time
chosen for the infantry to rush for
ward under cover of a final intensive
chorus of hell from the artillery. The
ridges hr front n?id on either hand
were flecked with racing sparks of
flame. Within an hour at least fifty
thousand shells must have been fired
within sight of the correspondent.
Far to the south was Mont St.
Quentin, two miles from Peronne and
commanding that town, which the al
lied commanders say will fall like a
ripe plum when the time comes. The
hill lay hazy above the green foliage
of the river valley in the midst of
vast bursts of black smoke from
shells of enormous caliber. Directly
in front was Combles, . another town
which has come to mean much to the
I i.; -1 it . ti: tt i i
and France who seem to regard its
sight in that the walls of many of its
buildings were still standing. It was
different,, too, in the fact, that it form-
ed an oasis in the storm of the bat
tle. Neither artillery nor infantry
Paid anr attention .to it. The gauge
of battle was the high ground around

command of the town. South of it lies
Ginchy and other points. .
For a time the infantry surged for

swelled to its utmost volume until

ished in that grim pall . while high
overhead scores of sausage balloons
and hundreds of aeroplanes, their
wings gleaming like silver in the
brilliant sunlight, strove vainly to see
what was passing beneath ,them.
Then, across the dead fields arose a
signal" from 'Mdrval which told that
the British infantry had reached an
other goal and that another village
was taken. A man at a telephone in
a nearby signal station .called out the
capture of the different strong points
with the enthusiasm of one who scores
a hotly contested game.
Presently the British wounded be
gan to straggle back and their bear
ing as they moved along beside their
prisoners, was another criterion by
which' the correspondent knew how
the day had gone without making in
quiries of the staff. The German ma
chine guns had stopped inem for a
I while at some points but generally re
ports told of every position being
token on the minute "set in the pro
gram. The British wounded said that
of course they got there as they were
used to getting there. Their great
ajarmies were fighting in the open. Ac
J cording to these men the Germans no
J longer have trenches except those
which are dug under fire.

CITY COUNCIL III
SPECIAL SES
Alderman, Engineer and Contractor
.
All Arrived at an Amicable
' Understanding -
The special session of council last
night for the purpose of considering
disputed matters concerning the new
light and water plant, instead of giv
ing rise to a hated controversy, de
deveoped from the first into what
Col. R. A Burford, counsel for Mr.
Benjamin Thompson, the contractor,
characterized as a "love feast." Coun
cil backed Twombly & Henney, the
city's engineers, and everybody was
satisfied. The work on the plant will
now proceed merrily.
The change in the De La Vergne oil
engine was first disposed of. Upon
the recommendation of Engineer Hen
ney, speaking for his firm, council ap
proved the change of engine, and
agreed that the city would pay for
the necessary change in the concrete
foundations for the new piece of ma
chinery upon the basis of the cost of
the original foundations called for. It
was again pointed out, and this time
by Mr. Henney, for the engineers, Mr,.
Thompson, the contractor, and Mr.
Gibbes, representing the De La Vergne
people, that the city would get in the
new oil engine a very superior piece
of machinery. Mr. Gibbes said that
the city would get an engine costing
the manufactures from $6000 to $7000
more than the city would pay for it,
the city would get a larger generator,
costing about $500 mare than the city
would pay for it, and the increase in
freight on the new' machinery would
cost the manufacturers about $300.
Mr. Gibbes said that Ocala would get
the best oil engine to be had. The De
La Vergne company, Mr. Gibbes said,
realized the opportunity it had here
in Ocala of proving the worthiness of
its engine. He said his company
realized that the eyes of the engineer
ing world would be on the plant here,
in which the oil engine would be
operated in direct competion with a
steam engine. Mr. Gibbes said that
the De La Vergne people asked that
the new engine be placed on a larger
foundation than called for in the
specifications for the plant. Mr.
Thompson said that the larger foun
dation would call for more concrete
and an increase in tne cost 01 con
struction, and asked that the city al
low him payment for this increase
Mr. Henney thought that the founda
tions called, for by the De La Vergne
people not necessary in view of the
peculiar soil conditions obtaining on
the site of the new plant. Mr. Gibbes
said that Mr. Henney was correct in
what he said, but asked that the
specifications of the De La Vergne
company for the foundations be adopt
ed. Mr. Gibbes said, and Mr. Henney
agreed, that the' increased cost would
be but a small item as compared with
the small cost of the better engine
the city would get. Mr. Gibbes said
that he' would like the- city to tie the
De La Vergne company "hand and
foot," in order that, in case anything
should go wrong at any time, the
company could not come back andsay
that the city did not put in the proper
foundations.
Councilman Moore voted against
approving the action of the engineers
in making changes of engines. Mr.
Moore wanted to know why the De La
Vergne people had not spoken of the
better engine in the first place. He
said that he could not understand why
any manufacturer would want to give
the city $6000 or $7000 worth of ma
chinery, nor why the city should pay

for additional foundations. He said!
w as certainly "an experiment, ne
thought that the De La Vergne com-
pany should be willing to pay for the
foundation also, as lone- as the com-
pany was so willing to put in the
large engine. J
MrHennev told council that it was
but proper that the contractor should
be paid for am extra cost on the
foundations, and said that if the con-
tractor wished council to approve the
action of the engineers in accepting
the change of engines it was nothing
but right that the contractor should
have the approval of council. Mr,
Henney said that his firm had acted,
in the matter in accordance with the
authority given them in contract and
specifications.
The second matter disposed of con
cerned the foundation for the water
tower. Mr. Thompson contended that
his contract did not call er the con-
struction of this loundation. yi. uur-
ford, for the contractor, contended
that there was nothing, in the con-1
tract and nothing in the specifications
referring to the foundation for the
tower, and that all other foundations
were referred to. Mr. nenney pointed
out that the engineers were given an-
thority to interpret the plans and
specifications, and said that the foun-
dation for the tower was plainly
shown on the plans for tne piant. mr.
Henney said that when the water
tower item was eliminated from, Mr.
Thompson's contract, and given to the
R. D, Cole company of Newnan, Ga.,
the Cole contract was for the tower
"above the foundation," which left the
bundation in Mr. Thompson's con
tract.
Col. Burford cdntended that the'en-
gineers could not act as a judicial
tnbunal; could not decide what was
in Mr. Thompson s contract ana wnaii
was not in it. Col. Burford said that
his client had not come before council
to make a figljt against that body or
against the engineers, but simply to
point out the disadvantage under
which the contractor labored because
of the difference of opinion as to
whether the water tower foundations
were a part of the contract or not.
Col. Burford said that Mr. Thompson
would be satisfied to have council sup-
pert the . engineer's contention, and
give instructions to have' the work
proceed; that Mr. Thompson would go
ahead with the work under protest,!
claiming that the foundation was not
m the contract, and asiang ior a set-
tlement later.
.
mere was a discussion witn regard
to certain- conversations, that took
place at the time the contract tor tne
ight and water plant was awarded,
among ihembers.of the council, the
city attorney and the contractor. Mr.
Thompson contended that in these
conversations it was agreed that the
tower foundations were not to be
part of his contract. Mr. Henney said
that conversations had nothing to do
with it, that tlfe written agreements
should be the guide in the matter. He
said that he could not do otherwise
than advise council to insist on Mr.
Thomnson's nutting in the founda
tion, either this, or that the city have
the foundation put in and charged
against the contractor. Mr. Henney
said-that council should be guided by
the advice of the city attorney, and
that council would be safe in doing so.
Mr. Henney a few minutes before had
had a conversation with Frederick
Hocker, city attorney.
, Council instructed the engineer to
have work on the tower foundation
start at once, according to the engi
neer's interpretation, which was that
the foundation constitute a
part of
Mr. Thompson's contract. Mr. Thomp
son said that he would start work im
mediately. He said he thought the!
whole matter merely an honest dif-
ference of opinion between the en
gineer and himself as to what was in
the contract and what not. Council
man Moore had asked to be excused
before the vote on this matter was
taken.
Council next asked Mr. Henney to
reply to Mr. Thompson's request for
itemized estimates of work done on
the plant. Mr. Henney said that he
had been preparing itemized esti
mates, and that copies of the same
were attached to the statements given
the council, and to the bank. Mr." Hen
ney said that he would gladly give Mr.
Thompson a copy of the itemized
statement at any time. Mr. Thomp
son, Mr. Henney said, had never ask
ed for one. Mr. Thompson admitted
this, it was agreed that the con
tractor would get the statement asked
for in the future.
Section 3 of the specifications for
the light and water plant reads as fol
lows:
"Should there be any doubt as to
the meaning of the specifications, or
any obscurity in the wording of them,
or should there appear any discrep
ancy between them and the plans, the

LIGHT ON THE FARM LOAN
Editor Star: There are a few pap
ex s that contend that the new farm
loan bill is no good, etc. Here are a
ft-w facts and figures that cannot be
denied or disputed as being correct.
Farmers, this new loan bill has
been, created for your benefit. Study
these figures and decide for yourself
if this bill is good, or bad, then act
I accordingly.
I Our Senator Fletcher, writing me
under date Sept. 19th, says in part
"Suppose a farmer wishes to borrow
$1,000. He4 would probably have to
pay 10 per cent interest for it, that
J would be $100 per annum. If he kept
I the money for 20 years he would pay
$2,000 interest. He would have to
I pay then, in order to cancel the mort
ae the Principal, making a total of
$3,000. Under the farm loan act he
would get his money at 5 per cent in
terest, and be paying $80.24 per an
num. He would pay in 20 years
$1,604.80 and would thereby liquidate
his entire indebtedness, have his mort-
gage cancened and thereby save $1,-
395.20."
This would be a saving to the far-
mer who borrows $1,000 from the
1 farm loan bank by paying $u.Z4 ior
twenty years of $69.70 per year over
J a 10 per cent interest account of the
j same amount.
J I also received from the national
J farm loan board an itemized Schedule
J showing how by paying $80.34 on in-
terest and principal the debt of $1000
j can be cancelled in twenty years for
I $1,604.84.
An ordinary loan at 5 per cent in-
terest on $1000 lor twenty years
would amount to $1Q00 plus principal
$1000, or it would cost you $2000.
Under the farm loan act it will cost
you but $1,604.84.
It is surely better for a man to get

having my
land rid of stumps, by having good
farm machinery, good cross fences,
good breeds of live stock, silos, etc.,
I can make a much larger net income
from the farm than I am getting now.
