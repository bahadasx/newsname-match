Wilson's Personal Choice For
Senate Snowed Under by In
dependent Democrat
BRUMBAUGH ENDORSED
No Contest For Officers; Wil

President
Trenton. N. J.. Sept. 27. Senator
James E. Martine won the Democratic
nomination tor United States Senator
by a safe majority over John W. West
cott, according to the vote canvassed
at 7 o'clock this morning. Westcott
is the State Attorney General and is
best known as the man who twice
nominated President Wilson. Returns
from 723 districts of the 1593 in the
State gave Martine 12,844 and West
cott 6.657.
H. Otto Wittpcnn of Jersey City
was unopposed for the Democratic
nomination for Governor.
The slowness of the count is laid
by election officials to the keen inter
est displayed in the local contests.
Inspectors of election, instead of
counting the votes of the principal
candidates first, left them to the last.
Wilson's Personal Choice
Wescott was made an issue by the
anti-Wilson Democrats, who were
lined up behind Martine. Wescott is
President Wilson's personal choice for
the nomination, and this fact was
quietly circulated among Democratic
workers, with the result that virtually
all of the organization men lined up
for him.
The organization Democrats are for
Wilson, and in this fight in Wilson's
own State for the United States sena
torial nomination they exerted every
effort to uphold the political prestige
of the President with utter failure.
Martine made virtually an inde
pendent fight, relying upon anti-ma
chine men and anti-Wilson Democrats
to land him the nomination.
Austen Colgate is in the lead in the
Republican gubernatorial contest ac
cording to corrected returns from yes
terday's primary election up to early
this afternoon. Through an error in
totaling the morning figures Walter
E. Edge, of Atlantic City, was report
ed to have a majority of 10.000 votes
over Colgate. The corrected returns
from 1,347 districts out of 1,893 in the
State give Colgate 58,501; Edge, 53,-
502. The error occurred in totaling
the results from Essex county where
Colgate makes his home. Instead of
being defeated there as first reported
Colgate polled 20,107 votes against
10,150 for Edge.
Senator James E. Martine is in
creasing his lead in the contest for the
Democratic nomination for United
States Senator. Returns from 1119
districts gave Martine 29,2-47; West
cott 14.816.
In the fight for the Republican
nomination for U. S. Senator. Freling
huysen is also increasing his lead.
Returns from 1400 districts
Frelinghuysen 67,139; Murphy 63,855.

ing the league's allegiance to the prin
ciples of the Republican party, endors
ing the platform of the Chicago con

f.ces. The resolutions continued:
"The league approves the progres
sive measures advocated by Governor
Martin G. Lrumbaugh in his inaugural
address and enacted into laws at the
last session of the Legislature."
It was declared that only the Euro
pean war had prevented a panic and
that "the manufacturing interests in
Pennsylvania involving capital and la
bor are so interwoven with the Repub
lican policy that if the war in Europe
were to cease and the Democratic
party were successful next November,
it would I t nothing short of a public
calamity."
W. E. Brewster, of New York, secre
tary of the National Republican
League, cheered the league with the
prediction of Republican majorities in
various states, which, he said, were
based on rtcent personal visits to vari
ous sections of the countrv. Some of
his estimates were: Illino'is, 200.000;
Ohio, 100.000; Indiana, 35,000: Wis
consin. 20,000; Minnesota. 125,000;
lowa, 65,000; Nebraska. 25,000; Kan
sas, 100,000; Missouri, safe; Kentucky,

South Harrisburg and East End
residents who were aroused shortly
before midnight by the sudden clamor
of a shrieking locomotive whistle

Reading railroad indignantly con
ferred to-day upon a plan of protest
to the railroad officials against a repe
tition of the racket. In the. event
that no relief be promised, an appeal
to the Public Service Commission is
contemplated.
Police headquarters, fireliouses and
the railroad offices were called fre
quently on the telephone by angry
pajamaed citizens whose rest had
been disturbed, for an explanation of
the screaming whistle. That an en
gineei was "whistling for his fireman

those whose rest had been disturbed.

Autoists Can't Use
Granolithic Walk on
River Wall For Drive
Motorists dare not use the grano
lithic walk along the River Front and
the luckless chauffeur who Is caught
driving on that section of the park
will be punished as severely as the de
partmental regulations will permit,
according to Park Commissioner K.
Z. Gross.
Complaints of the growing fre
quency of "speeding parties" aJong the
city's "front steps," of the pleasure
tours that are arranged from time to
time, of the quaint habit that many
car owners enjoy of taking their ma
chines down over the bank to scrub.
Failure of Council to provide sufficient
funds to pay park policemen
course, limits the means of observa
tion and supervision by officers, ac
cording to Mr. Gross, but every ef
fort will be made to keep the auto
mobiles from the walk.
