DUE TOTHE WAR
So Says Fairbanks of Demo
crats—Confidence Un
dermined.
Omaha, Neb., Sept. 27.—"Demo
cratic prosperity is due to war, while
Republican prosperity grows out of
the normal and peaceful industries of
the people," declared Charles W.
Fairbanks, Republican nominee for
vice-president, in his principal ad
dress in Omaha.
In opening his addresB Mr. Fair
banks declared that graver problems
tax the judgment of the. American
people than were presented since the
days of Lincoln.
After stating that one of the first
things the present administration did
was to overturn the Republican sys
tem of protection, the speaker aald:
"The law promptly did its work. It
began to undermine confidence, breed
distrust, reduce the public revenue,
close factories, throw out of employ
ment hundreds of thousands of wage
earners, and Increase bread lines in
many parts of the country.
"In due course relief came to us,
not through democracy but through
one of the cataclysms in the political
world that dimmed all that preceded
that through the ages the founda
tions of Europe trembled In the grasp
of a mighty war."
The prosperity that -followed In the
wake of the war was not due to the
party In power, Mr. Fairbanks de
clared.
The Fairbanks party left at mid
night for Colorado.

GOTHAM TODAY
Labor Leaders Declared
That 250,000 Workers
Walked Out.
MANY JEWS QUIT
FOR HOLIDAYS
This Makes it Difficult to
Determine Exact Num
ber Idle.
New York, Sept. 27.—A general
strike of labor unions in sympathy
with striking street car men is sup
posed to be effective today, and, al
though labor leaders claimed thai
some 250,000 workers had responded
to the call, there was little evidence
that a strike was in progress.. Fri«
vate canvassers Reported at least 21
unions failed to respond to the strike
call.
The only report received at police
headquarters was that 250 members
of the painters' union failed to report
for work. Attempts to estimate the
number of strikers were complicated
somewhat by the fact that thousands
of Jewish workers will remain idle
over Thursday and Friday in celebra
tion of the beginning of the Jewish
new year.
Figures given out at a meeting of
representatives of labor unions, show
ed that union workers to the number
of 125,600 went on strike today in
sympathy with the street car men.
