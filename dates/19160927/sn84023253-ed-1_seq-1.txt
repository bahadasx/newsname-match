Morrisville, Sept. 25 A case of in
fantile paralysis having appeared in
Elmore, a meeting of the local board
of health of Morristown was held,
with two of the local physicians be
sides the health officer present, also
several business men, and the ques
tion of closing the schools and other
public places was thoroughly dis
cussed. The secretary of the state
board of health was consulted over
the telephone, and it was finally de
cided to close the churches and local
theatorium, but allow the schools to
continue, all of the five physicians of
Morrisville to be at the village schools
each morning for a period of two
weeks to examine every pupil with
the understanding that the parents
should have the option of keeping
their children at home providing that
they confine-them strictly to their
own premises, keeping them apart
from all other children; otherwise,
that they would be compelled to at
tend school or be quarantined for a
period of two weeks.

St- Johnsbury awaits the return of Company D from its tour of
duty on the Mexican border. The Commercial club is planning a
rousing welcome for the boys who went away with the willingness to
lace death ior the btars and btripes, but upon whom, without any
fault of their own, the duty did not devolve.
The Green Mountain boys took place side by side with the reg
ulars at Hiagle rass and the word has been sent here that the regiment
was second to none. The Commercial club of St. Johnsbury, which
has taken an active interest in the company, to the extent of raising
a lund ol over half a thousand dollars for their benefit, is planning for
a great home-coming. 'Just what the for mof reception will be is
not known at this writing, but the fact that Rev. Paul Moody, Elisha
May, George H. Cross and Frank H Brooks constitute the committee
of arrangements is sufficient for the statement that St- Johnsburv will
not be behind other towns in the state in the welcoming of the soldier
boys back rom Texas.

The Vermont militia consisting of
789 men and 46 officers, Col. Ira L
Reeves commanding," arrived at Bur
lington at an early hour this morn
ing, after a three months' tour of
duty at Eagle Pass, Texas. The men
spent the remainder of the night in
Burlington aboard the cars. Early in
the morning they proceeded to Fort
Ethan Allen.
At the post they will go Into quar
ters assigned to them by Col. J. C.
Dickman of the second cavalry.
The regiment left Eagle Pass Wed
nesday night, September 20. and trav
eled in three sections, Col. Reeves,
Major Cooley, Major T. J. Hagan and
A B and C and D companies in the
first section; Lieut. Col. Fred B.
Thomas , Maj. J. M. Ashley and
Lieut. W. Hayes Mltchel and I, K and
L companies In the second section; ;
Major G. w. Tinker, Lieut. W. H.
Taylor and E, F, G and K companies
in the third section.
me mustering out of the troops
from federal service will take at
least a week, during which the men
wjll occupy quarters at the post. The
officers for the most part will be sta
tioned In the band barracks. Com
panies A and B will be In K troop's
barracks; E and F will be stationed
In M troop's quarters; G, H and I in
the ambulance corps barracks, and
K, L and M in the machine gun bar
racks. Col. Reeves and staff will be
in one of the officers' row houses.
Capt. B. F. Hyland, Major Carpenter,
Capt, E. W. Woodman, Lieut. Shel
don and Mai. Melville, officers com
manding the 160 unassigned recruits
have been occupying one of the
houses on officers row since the re
turn of this detachment from Brattle
boro when It started for Eagle Pass
on August 31. The regiment, while i
it remains at the post will have a reg
ular program of dally drill and tar
get range practice. The state nation
al guard rifle team, which Is to com
pete in the national matches In Flor
ida October 20. will be picked at this
time and will go to Jacksonville a
few days after the regiment is mus
tered out. Only one battalion has
been able to get any target practice
while at the border so that the team
will be considerably handicapped
Governor Gates will hold a review
of the regiment on Friday afternoon
and there will be nightly concerts by
the regimental band during the regi
ment's stay at the post. The 160 un
assigned recruits, who have had
nothing to do in camp all summer,

row.
Adjt. Gen. Lee S. Tlllotson of St.
Albans, who returned last week from
a five days' stay at Easrle Pass will
be at the post until the regiment is
mustered out. He said today the
Vermont regiment was regarded by
regular army officers as one of the
most efficient of the national organ
izations and made a record of which
the state should be proud. The mus
tering out will be done by battalions
and the men will be sent to their
homes by companies. The mustering
out from federal service causes the
men to revert automatically to their
rormer status as state militiamen and
they are still subject to federal as
well as state call. The process prac
tically results in giving the men a va
cation from active duty until they
may be needed again or until their
term of enlistment expires. The
members of C company made up
mostly of TJ. V. M. students, were dis
charged upon their arrival and are
not subject to either state or federal
call without re-eullstlng.

The athletic association which last

the addition of the remainder of the
