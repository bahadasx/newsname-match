of the death of Dr. Maurice Waller at

Dr. Waller had suffered a general
breakdown last winter and was taken
in February to Kenova, W. Va to stay
with relative. In July he was taken
to Oak Park to remain with his sis

and as a great surprise to his many
friends and admirers here.
Dr. Maurice Waller was born in
July, 1840, on the place now owned by
Mr. W. W. Baldwin on the Lexington
Pike. He was the son of Henry and
Sarah l-anghorne Waller, his father
being a prominent lawyer of hls
county at that time. In 181 his fam
ily moved to Chicago.
He professed an early desire to be
cilmii a minister and attended Centre
College and the Danville Theological
Seminary at Danville, Ky. He was
iiIbo a graduate of the McCormack
Theological Seminary of Chicago. Af
ter entering the ministry he filled
many important pastorates In several
states at various times but he always
claimed Maysvllle as his home ana
loved to be In this city. His last regu
lar pastorate was at Lebanon, Ky. Af
ter his restlrement from the active
field of the ministry ho settled in
Maysvllle and from thitj point he
would fill various churcheH in tin'
surrounding country.
His wife was Miss Elizabeth Mar
shall of Washington, daughter of Col.

dren are Mr. Henry Waller of Port-,
land. Ore., Miss Phoebe Waller of No-.
York City, Mrs. Shelby Hlatterman of
this county and Mrs. Gilbert Wllker

survived by tour Rimers and twe
brothers.
Dr. Waller wns known to almost ev
ery resident of the county as he had
filled pulpits of all the Presbyterian
and many of the other churches in
the county.
He was a very earnest minister and
preached for the joy of It. Often af
ter preaching n very long sermon he
would be surprised to learn that so
lOM time had passed. He was an
Interesting speaker and never failed to
command the attention of his audi
ence. He wan a splendid character
and a gentleman in every walk of life.
As yet no arrangements have been
made for the funeral but It is supposed
that the body will be brought to Mays
