British and French Continue
Their Advance Along the
Western Front, With No
Lull in Continuous Battle
London, Sept. 17. Without a
moment's breathing spell, the allies
are pushing tholr great offensive on
the 8omme front with renewed vigor,
following the capture of Thlepval
and Comblei.
The German war office this after
soon admitted tho loaa of Thlepval
and reported that the British have
puihinl forward on both aides of
Conrcelotte. after sufferlug heavy
loiiies. The Berlin statement report
ed no cessation In tho furious fighting
on the line that once rested on
Combles. The allies continued the
attack last night, but on this sector,
as well as south of the 8omme, all
Anglo-French onslaughts were re
pulsed, the German war office stated.
General . Halg's afternoon report
emphasized the fact that there has
been no lull In the fighting. Ad
vancing nearer to Bapaume, the Brit
ish made progress last night In the
direction of EaucQurt-L'Abbaye, less
than three miles from llapnume. The
British alone took from 3.000 to
4,000 prisoners In Monday and Tues
day's fighting. )
London, Sept. 27. The most suc
cessful blow struck by Anglo-French
troops since tho battle of the Marne
brought the capture of Peronne and
flapaumo appreciably nearer.
It Is possible, English military
critics snld today, that both the
towns, the Immediate objectives of
tho great allied offensive, will fall
within a fortnight. The apparent
ease with which German resistance
collapsed at Thlepval yesterday, fol
lowing the capture of Combles, sur
prised military observers here and
led them to predict quick victories
for tho British and French In the
drives on Peronne and Dapaume.
A large number of German prison
ers have been brought In all along
the Sommn front as the result of yes
terday's successful operation!. At
Combles group after group of Ger
mans was cut off and cornered be
tween British and French detach
ments closing In upon the village.
They fought desperately from under
ground caverns until they were sil
enced by bombing parties.
The final dash Against Combles de
veloped Into somo of the most sav
age fighting of the wholo war. Tho
Germans caught In the southwestern
angle of the village stuck to tholr ma
chine tuna bravely and died at their
posts. The French, advancing through
the cemetery on tho northeast, were
repeatedly counter-attacked by Teu
ton detachments that stormed thotr
lines In the faro of certain death.
Details -of the enpture of Thlepval

REICHSTAG
Attempt Will Be Made in the
German Body to Pass Vote
of No Confidence in Tea
ton Chancellor Tomorrow
Berlin, 8ept. 87. The stormiest
session of the relchstag since the be
ginning of the war was foreshadowed
today In discussions In the Berlin
hotels by members who arrived for
the opening session tomorrow.
Dr. Coerting, an Industrial leader,
from Hanover, will move a rote of no
confidence In Chancellor von Beth
mann4iotlweg. Coerting represents
one of the center party groups, wag
ing war on the chancellor.
(A rote of no confidence in the Ger
man reichstag does not carry the sig
nificance attaching to similar action
in most European parliaments, where
such an expression of displeasure Is
followed by the resignation of the
ministry.)
The absence of Dr. Llebknecbt,
radical socialist, arrested several
weeks ago for taking part In a dis
turbance In Berlin, will certainly not
contribute to a calm session, though
Llebknecbt waa probably the relch
stag's most disturbing member.
Other opponents of the govern
ment are ready to furnish attacks
as soon as the bars are let down for
debate.
The chancellor will address the
reichstag at 3 p. m., on subjects not
yet revealed. The voting of war cre
dits and Germany's future policy to
wards England will be the chief
topic of the three-weeks' session.
The conservatives are pleased at
the results of the latest Zeppelin
raids and will demand an even more
severe anti-English campaign.
