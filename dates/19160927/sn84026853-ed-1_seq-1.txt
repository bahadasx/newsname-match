Hon. A. F. Lever Addresses
Farmers and
Rncinooc TV/T^-n
UUAllVkJO ITXVlli
St. Matthews, S. C., Sept. 22.?
Congressman A. F. Lever made an
address here Thursday before an audience
of farmers and business men
of the county. The speaker was introduced
by D. S. Murph, Esq., clerk
of the agricultural committee. The
meeting was held in the court house.
His speech was in the interest of
grading and marketing cotton in the
south.
He said, in part:
"One out of every five farmers
does not know the grades of cotton
and the farmer is the only person
who sells his products and doesn't
know what he sells. The majority
of buyers know nothing of grading
cotton: the average man is just as
competent to grade eggs as he is cotton.
Experts who have looked into
the matter say that it costs the farmer
from $10 to $12 per bale to sell
to these incompetent buyers. Most
buyers grade cotton a little low to
protect themselves. There are men
in this country who are getting rich
by this method of grading.
"Congress has undertaken to solve
the problem of proper marketing for
farm products. In 1913 an appropriation
of $50,000 was given for this
purpose by congress to establish a
market of standard grades. The cotton
standard act now pending in congress
will establish a board of arbitration.
If you are not satisfied with
grade you can accept the opinion of
the experts. My visit here today is
to further the interest of marketing
farm products. The department will
send iu^&an expert if the citizens
request it; and these experts are the
best in the country. Experts' samples
of cotton can be bought for $20.
The proposition is to save dollars
and cents for the man who raises and
sells cotton. The matter of grading
is one of the biggest problems that
confronts the farmer.
"The local warehouse should cooperate
with the federal warehouse;
each should be bonded.
"The cotton stndard act is pending
nnH this wil ltnlrf nf tlio <?nttnn
that does not go into the warehouse."
He said he felt sure that the act
would pass, as the committee had
passed favorably upon same. He stated
that a man would be sent here
free of charge to demonstrate what
it means.
"The biggest markets in the United
States have experts and accept
these grades," he said.
Upon motion of T. M. Wannamaker
and seconded by T. A. Amaker
an association was formed to be
known as the Cotton Marketing Association
of Calhoun County. J? E.
Wannamaker was elected president
of this association and J. C. Redmon
secretary and treasurer. The association
requested that an expert be
sent here immediately.
FARMER KLUGH.
Mr. W. A. Klugh, of the Green
wood side, was in Abbeville a few
days ago and brought the editor a
package of cornfield beans, which
were very much appreciated. He also
showed us sample bools of a fine variety
of cotton which he is raising
on his farm. The bolls have five
locks each, of extra heavy cotton
and of fine fibre.
Mr. Klugh is one of the progressive
farmers of the county. He raises all
kinds of farm supplies at home, and
gets the necessities of life from the
farm. When he comes to town he
comes to sell and not to buy.
LEAVING HERE TO TRAVEL.
Mr. Ernest Wardlaw left our city
on Tuesday for Knoxville, Tenn.,
where he goes to travel for a Hosiery
Company. Ernest has been in our
midst for sometime on a pleasant ,
vacation, but went off looking very
light hearted regardless of a few
