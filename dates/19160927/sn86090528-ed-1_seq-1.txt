London, Sept. 27. The capture of
Bapaume and Peronne were brought
appreciably nearer through the most
successmul blow that has been struck
since the battle of the Marne it is de
clared by English military critics, fbl
lowing the taking of Combles.
Both of these towns, which are the
immediate objectives In the allied of
Tensive, may fall within a fortnight,
the experts say. It was apparent that
the east German resistance collapsed
at Thiepval yesterday, following the
capture of Combles. This was a sur-
prise to the military observers and led
them to predict an early victory for
the allies at Peronne and Bapaume.

of the scalp nor a fracture. He
thought he had been struck with a
ciub but Johnnie Smith, a witness In
the case, admitted having hit Summers
with a brick when the latter threaten
ed him with a gun. Two shells were
empty and Summers first said he had
fired them at Smith. This Smith de
nies and other witnesses state Sum
mers did not fire a shot at that time.

would die. No action has been taken

MEAT NOT
MEANT FOR
HUMANS
Max Wardall Says This Article of Diet is
Cause of Many Frightful Maladies
and Will Pass Out of Use
"Tliu slaughter of animals for food
is only a step removed from human
slaughter," asserted Max Wardall in
li's talk at tho city hall on "The Real
Superman," last night. Tho speaker
said that animals and birds love and
cling to life as we do, and look up to
us as we look up to God, and yet we
strike them down in sport and to grat
ify our appetites. "As long as wo are
cruel and destructive towards the
furred and feathered creatures, we
shall bo violent and murderous toward
one another," said Mr. Wardall. "The
Idea that animals were created for us
to oat Is a gross and heartless super
stition and the sooner we outgrow it
(lie better. Tho best physiologists of
the day admit that meat Is not neces
sary to good health, and many assort
that. It is a positive menace to the hu
man system and is a direct or underly
ing cause ot a host of frightful mala
dies that affect the race. Meat serves
as well to stimulate the baser passions
of man and to aggravate the anlro .;
propensities that they are trying h,
subdue. The days of liquor traffic in
the United Staler re numbered, and
with it will go the widespread and
wholesale use of meat. Both meat
and liquor, whether used by the refin
ed lady of culture or the brutal savage,
serve only one purpose, the gratifica
tion of an unnatural craving of the
lower nature." Mr. Wardall will give
the last lecture of his series tonight
at the city hall. Subject, Esoteric
Christianity. Admission free.
In introducing the speaker, United
States Commissioner Hamilton said
that theosophy was the first to draw
away from the doctrine of tho pot
and the potter which had been the un
derlying principle ot all christian
churches.

GATHERING
SCATTERING
GOLD STOCK
Federal Reserve Bank Furnishes Useful
Purpose and Becomes Firm Basis for
Note Issue in Case of Panic
GOLD WILL FLOW OUT
OF U.S. AFTER BIG WAR
President Lynch of American Bankers A
sociation bpeaks of Probable Con
dition Soon to Be Confronted
By United Press.
Kansas City. Sept. 27. President
James K. Lynch of San Francisco, ad
dressing the American Bankers asso
ciation, congratulated the association
on tho substantial progress mado dur
ing the past year, both in membership,
which has now reached a totul of 1C,
010 banks, and in Its numerous activ
ities, which have exercised a profound
ly beneficial Influence on the banki
of the country.
Tho most Important, subject before
the bankers of America today, said
resident Lynch, Is the Federal Re
serve Act and the operation of tho
twelve reserve banks. Criticism of
tho reserve banks had come from dif
ferent sources; from the banks In tlia
financial centers, which objected to
the absorption by the reserve bauka
of the supply ot bank acceptances;
from the small banks In the more re
mote districts, which complained that
the requirements for eligible paper
are too strict; and from the member
banks generally, protesting against an
enforced Investment which carries no
Immediate prospect of dividends and
on reserve deposits on which no Inter
est Is paid. To all these objectors .be1
pointed out that conditions tor two
years past have been abnormal aiul
furnished no evidence of what the re
serve sjjstem could do, but that much
had already been accomplished. Bank
acceptances for the first time have
been made possible, as credit Instru
ments In connection with the import
and export of merchandise, the dollar
credit is making its way in South
America and In the Orient and our na
tional banks are opening branches in
foreign countries. On the question of
reserves Mr. Lynch said:
"The federal reserve banks are grad
ually concentrating the stock of gold
which heretofore has been almost use
les", because scattered. In the hands
ot those banks it will be a firm basis
for a note issue which will take care
ot any demands for currency that pan
ic conditions may produce. We all
know how futile it has been to attempt
to meet extraordinary demands by pay
ing out gold, and we know how banks
have competed with each other to se
cure gold, drawing ft from centers
where it would be of some use to out
posts where it was valueless. It Is
obvious that we have overworked the
word 'reserve.' Gold Is the only true
reserve, for it pays debts in any civil
ized country and under any conditions.
Under ordinary circumstances, balanc
es carried with corresponding banks
form a convenient method of paying
our debts to depositors, so such bal
ances have been called reserves,
though they cannot properly be so des
ignated. Balances with the federal re
serve banks are now legally entitled
to be called reserves and yet they fall
short in the final Ust availability in
all countries and at all times."
Touching upon the European war,
the great flotations ot foreign loans
hers and the enormous iutlow of gold,
Mr. Lynch said:
"We may expect that as soon as the
ar is over and the normal imports ot
merchandise are resumed the excess of
:jold will leave us, and this will be by
no means an evil. The surplusage of
gold and the loaning power set free by
the Federal Reserve Act together are
likely to cause a credit expansion
which will need careful supervision by
our bankers, to the end that the cor
responding contraction does not find
us unprepared. The control of both
the export and the import of gold
should be guided by the Federal Re
serve Board, which was Intended to
perform this function and which has
the power necessary to stabilize ex
change through this means."
