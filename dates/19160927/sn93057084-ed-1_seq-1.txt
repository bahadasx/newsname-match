voters to vote '"YHS" on the
amendments and referd laws, at
the coming general election. As
the Advance says. "These are all
live questions of the hour, and
voters should inform themselves,
and not do as many did two years
ago. vote Xo on all, in order to not
vote on something they did not un
derstand. It would be wiser this
year to vote YES on everything."
If you are not satisfied about
any measure, why not give it the

Mitchell, S. D.—The Anti-Saloon

throughout the state to the effort thtit
tho vote for the adoption of the prohi
bition amendment to the constitution
this fall must be "Yes," whereas a
vote in favor of prohibition at the
spring election has always been "No."
There is apt to be confusion in the
mind of the voters in this regard un
less careful attention is given to the
mutter. In the spring the question on
the ballot is, "Shall intoxicating liq
uors be sold at retail?" and "Xo" vote
is a dry vote. At the fall election the
ba!lot will contain the title of the
resolution passed by the legislature
calling for a prohibition amendment
to the constitution and under the title
will he the words, "Shall the above
amendment to the constitution be ap
proved and ratified?" and the dry
vote will have to be "Yes."
The entire ballot will he as fol
lows:
"A joint, resolution proposing and
agreeing to an amendment of the con
dilution of the state of South Dakota,
and to be known as Article XXIV of
said constitution, relating to the pro
hibition of the intoxicating liquor
traffic, and submitting the same to a
