is the one for which the posse of
more than 200 men, under Sheriff

SHOTS, SAYS DISPATCH
Chihuahua City, Mex., Sept. 26.—
An exploring column under General
Cavazos encountered a body of Vil
listas west of Fresno, a station on
the Mexico-Northwestern Railway,
about ten mileq out of Chihuahua
City, but after an exchange of shots,
the Carranxistas retired to Fresno
to await the coming of General Ra­
mos, with a body of cavalry. This is
the .report that General Cavazos made
a special trip to town town to give
to General Wevino. There were no
casualties, he said.
It was only after her arrest in an­
other case that West became con­
vinced that the Godman woman was
a member of the band, and not a
fellow victim, he said today. Her as­
sumed mortification and fear of publi­
city had been the cause of his con­
tributing the money rather than fac­
ing prosecution as a white slaver,
he said. She convinced him, he told
Federal authorities, that she was an
innocent convent girl, and it was to
save her that he finally met the de­
mands of the blackmailers.
West said he and the woman were
brought from New York to Chicago
in custody of the blackmailers, whom
he thought were agents of the De­
partment of Justice, taken into the
Federal building here and to the very
door of the Government investigators
before he decided to give over the
money to save prosecution.
Later, they were taken to an office
building, which a member of the gang,
who represented himself to be a Unit­
ed States Commissioner, advised him
to ketfp the case out of the courts by
paying his captors.

before the terrific attack of the
French and British, the Germans
fighting to the death or surrendering

The French and British troops

overran the town, and carried all be­

says:
"Prior to the loss of Combles, the

communication issued by the German
war office, which, after describing
briefly the great artillery bombard­

four days, and the attack between he

'the conquest of the villages on the

Joint Commissioners Suggest
Amendment To Keep Ameri­
cans Out of Conflicts
DIPLOMATS MADE SOME
HEADWAY IN CONFERENCE
New London, Conn., Sept. 26.—Re­
vision of American neutrality laws,
with a view to discouraging Amer­
icans from participating in Mexican
factional conflicts, was suggested at
a conference of the Mexican-American
joint commission today. It was indi­
cated that Mexico would be able to
deal more effectively with rebels and
ordinary bands of outlaws If the neu­
trality laws were amended in such
manner as to make it an offense for
an American citizen to participate in
any way in a movement against a
government with which the United
States is at peace.
The Mexican commissioners charged
that the inadequacy of the American
law made possible the propagation of
conspiracies on American soil against
established order In Mexico. The con­
sideration of operation of neutrality
laws was not confined to those of the
United States, however. The Amer­
ican representatives, since the con­
ference began, have held that Mexico
should so govern her frontier so as to
make unnecessary the presence of
an American posse on the south side
if the boundary line.
The American commissioners sub­
mitted a list of border raids that had
been compiled by the war department.
The Mexican commissioners counter­
ed by the presentation of another list
specifying instances where American
soldiers or citizens had crossed the
boundary* into Mexico.
