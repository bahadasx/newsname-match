Applications for this aviation service
are to be made through Gen. Johnron.
It is evident that the staunch tack
ing of aviation on Oanu which Gen.
v. 'Ivans has shown is producing results
JL'he plan to send would-be aviators to
San Diego will not interfere with the
plan to establish an aviation school

Hope for G. 0. P., Leaders

By C. S. ALBERT '
(SpcUl 8ur-BttIlttia Corrmpondene) ,
WASHINGTON, D. C, Sept: 18.
The possibility that a higher protec
tive duty may be placed on sugar
grows. It Is too early for the word
"probabIllty.- Within two months
the matter may . be determined and
speculation now becomes useless, if
not misleading. -!
The result of the Maine elections Is
perhaps of more interest and import
a nee . to the people of Hawaii than
those of any other locality. Restora
tion of the old rates on sugar aro
brought nearer. The Republicans
gained one senator and one member
of the house. J
In order to reestablish the 'duties
carried by the Payne-Aldrich act is j
applied to sugar It is essential for the
Republicans to regain control not only '
of the house but the senate. . There
is a general belief prevailing . among
politicians that possibly the house
may be made Republican. The senate
is a different proportion. The Demo
cratic ; majority is large and but a
third of the membership is elected at
the November contest It would be
futile to attempt tariff revision at an
extraordinary session, in the event of
Mr. Hughes' election, if the senate re
mained Democratic. - Republican suc
cess would naturally add ona vote in
the person of Vice-President Fairbanks
if a tie should occur. But in order to
accomplish anything toward tariff re
vision the Republican must control Uu
senate in addition to the house. For
that reason every ounco of energy is
being exerted to achieve Republican
success in close senatorial contests. 7
The victory In Maine la a double
step in the direction of change in
senate and house. It Is far short of
decisive, but one step In tho direction
of what Republicans hope to achieve.
The. Republicans of the senate ap
pointed a special committee to do
nothing but fight for control In all the.
doubtful states. They are remaining
up nights trying to pull down all the
senatorshlps where Democrats are
seeking reelection.' Senator, Weeks is
