"The law of club and fang" wa put
into practice in Oklahoma City today.
Imaginary clubs were wielded all day
by conductors of street cars to prevent
State Fair visitors from risking their
lues on trolley conveyances already
crowdrd to rapacity, and the passen
gers were obliged to figuratively hold
onto the nearest protuberance by their
teeth
Estimates made at the fair ground
at 1 o'clock were that 30.000 peoplo
would be on the grounds before the af
ternoon ended. More than 7,000 had
paid admission before 11 o'clock. There
were 16.000 attended the fair last year
on Oklahoma City day.
Rush Starta Early.
The rush to the State Fair grounds
occasioned by the fact that the first
automobile races of the week began
this afternoon started at 7 o'clock thlt
morning, when thousands began pour
ing into the city via inlerurban can,
trains, automobiles, buggies and foot,
Those whi did not possess private ve
hicles rode on street can when they
could get aboard.
Crushes on Can.
From the beginning of the Stat
i air siren car crusli, cars were run
every two minutes hy the Oklahoma
Railway company. Crowded to suffo
i at ion, tb, passengers clung to straps,
handrails and woodwork in their anx
iety to get to the exposition. Downtown-bound
cars, cut the other hand,
rained few passengers. It was fvl
den that most of the visitors intended
slaying at the Fair all day.
Ideality of Weather.
Clear skies and a hrrete just suffi
ciently strong to make the Fair's myr
iad flags s'and out stiffly against tha
clouds, held forth promise of ideal con
ditions for this afternoon's races.
Many telephone calls were received at
the Fairgrounds this morning from
out-of-town people, inquiring as to
weather conditions. State Fair officals
believed attendance today would com
pare favorably with "Roosevelt Day,"
which opened the fair in 1VI2.
Race Track Treated.
The big race track had been oiled,
rolled and put in perfect condition for
today's speed events. All morning me
chanics and drivers were engaged In
going .over their machines, toning
engines, oiling and burnishing and

and a majority of the retail stores and
