Chesterfield Sholarship Award- !
ed to Orangeburg Girl
Cheraw Chronicle.
Announcement was made last
Week that the Winthrop scholarship
for Chesterfield county
had been awarded to Miss Frazil
Houser. Protest was at once
made on the ground that Miss
Houser was not a citizen of ,
Chesterfield county. t
The matter came up for hear- (
ing before the state board in
Columbia last week but the protest
was overruled and the scholarship
was awarded Miss Houser.
The
facts in the matter as we
gather them are as follows:
About two months before the
examination for the scholarships
was held, a lady giving her came
as Mrs. Annie E. Houser. took
charge of the Raynard Hotel in
this city. The examination for |
the vacant scholarship was held
the 9th of July and Miss Houser
was a contestant September 2
it became known that the scholatship
had been awarded to her. ,
i"hat afternoon Mrs. houser va ,
cated the Ranard Hotel and left
the following day for her home
in St. Matthews, Orangeburg ,
bounty.
The contention of the protes
tants was that Miss Houser was
not a citizen of Chesterfield ,
county, and even if she had
been she had forfeited her right
to the Chesterfield scholarship
when she moved away from the
county.
On Saturday, Sept. 9th, Mrs.
Houser returned to Cheraw and
tried to get back the Ranard Ho
tel, failing in this she sought a
lawyer lor legal advice in an effort
to hold the scholarship for
i t .
ner aaugnter.
We are informed that quite
a number of affidavits were introduced
in the hearing before
the state board, among them
one by Mrs. Houser to the effect
that she had only left Cheraw
temporarily and would return
and make it her home.
In Mrs. Houser's effort to sustain
the award of the scholar
ship, it developed that Mrs.
Houser was not a widow at all
?that after Mr. Houser's death
she had married again and that
there are several children by the
second marriage but that she
and her husband had been living
apart for several years. So the
contention of those who claim
that it is a shame to ''fight a poor
widow woman" falls flat.
The truth of the matter, cs
seen by The Chronicle, is that
Miss Houser is a citizen of
Urangeburg county and is not
entitled to a scholarship intended
by law for a Chesterfield
county girl.
Superintendent of Education
Rouse is to be commended for
the fight he made before the ,
state hoard in the interests of
justice and the rights of Chester
field county girls. And in this
connection we will add that
State Superintendent of Education
Swearingen took the same
position that Mr. Rouse did and
that The Chronicle does?that
the scholarship was for a Ches
terfield county girl?and that
Mis8 HotlSPr is nrkt a petnr.

Some Things Needed to Make f
Your School Better
We were talking with a country
teacher about these things 2
the other day and he heartily J'
approved our ideas. "There are
three ways of getting students to ^
work," he said, "and they are by fe
the use of personality, rewards, v
and force. In my opinion the u
efficient teacher will not consid- c
er force. Then while personal- I
ity is important, many teachers b
lack it. They can develop it, v
but tnat takes time. And even
then I believe rewards should a
be used to stimulate effort. In a
every boy or girl, man or f
woman there is a desire to ex I
eel, and this desire should be the
teacher's working capital. If a a
teacher can once develop a spirt
of good-natured rivalry among s
the students, success is won both s
for him and them." v
And then from nis own expe- fi
rience our teacher-friend offered s
to other teachers the following f<
additional suggestions for quick- s
ening and developing this "de- r
sire to excel": ti
1. Post on some sort of school C
bulletin boatd the average grades h
of your students each week. p
2. Arrange to have your local 11
newspaper print each month the f
names of those making a grade
of 90 or over. F
3. Post a list of students who
haven't been tardy or missed a
day for a week; for a month; ?
two months; three months; and s
so on through the whole school n
year. Also have your local (
newspaper print these list month" j.
IV. ?
44 Have "triDnint." in vnnr ?
. . ?? ? a
spelling classes, organize a de- a
bating socity also, and arrange v
for a series of spelling matches
and debates with neighboring 0
schools, getting the parents to j,
attend. j,
5. Give out cards each month p
to students who have been on
time each morning, who have b
not missed a day, who have giv- b
en good deportment, and who 0
have made above a certain standard
average grade. For exam- n
pie: This is to certify that James p
Brown has not been absent or s,
tardy during the month of Oct- r,
ober, that he has given good de- n
portment, and has made an av- e
erage grade of 90." q
6. Devote each Friday after- e
noon to recitations, songs, de n
bates, exhibits, etc., giving nom- b
inal prizes to the bovs and girls e
who do best. Invite the patrons h
of the school to attend the exer- p
cises once each month and try c
to develon their interest.

7. See the local merchants 0
near your scnooi and get litem (
to give prizes. They will be
glad to do in most cases.?Progressive

Controversy Will Be Ad- j
justed ^
The State, Saturday (
The fire insurance situation p
will be satisfactorily adjusted bv p
the next legislature, in the opin- b
ion of (J. K. Laney, member of p
the senate from Chesterfield ft
county, who was among the vis- n
itors in Columbia yesterday. 1
Senator Laney was the author N
of the fire insurance bill passed f<
by the last legislature. 1<
Gov. Manning will probably p
deal with the fire insurance sit- \
nation in his annual message to b
the next general assembly. In e
a recent letter the governor n
stated that he would probably g
urge the creation of a State rate w
riaking bureau. "
Senator Laney said yesterday n
bat the fire insurance situaticn g,
lad shown much improvement p,
luring the last five months. b

The Cheraw Chronicle gives M
the following account of the ar- i
rest of a Chesterfield county
_ man in New York last week bv 3
Sheriff Douglass: 1
a "Vernon S. Blackburn was "
c brought in this morning by i
a Sheriff Douglass from Staten <
5 Island, N. Y., and is now lodged ^
lt in jail to await trial on charges j
j of adultry and desertion. Black- ^
j burn lived near McBee and t
married several vears ago a j
# daughter of Mr. John T. Gul- j
ledge. On the 28th of March, a
I 1915, he left for parts unknown j
. taking with him his wife's j
j younger sister. Nothinc was a
heard of them until about two 2
r montns ago when the "sister" j
returned home. She refused, j
however, to give any informa- t
j tion. A short time afterward* 2
? Mrs. Blackburn received a letter f
from her delinquent husband 2
i and this leltei was turned over !
J to the authorities. A warrant 2
' was issued and reauisition pa- 2
. pers secured and sheriff Doug- \
lass went alter his man." I?
iV. R. Elliot Speaks This Week >
Mr. W. R. Elliot, the district
iemonstration agent, will be in
his county Thursday and Fri- I
lay of this week to aid Mr. Til- c
er in his campaign for a larger
icreage in crimson clover, vetch,
ye and oats and for field selecion
of seed corn. Mr. Elliott is
?
veil known and well liked in
his county and his coming al *
vays proves of benefit to the j
'armers. A meeting will be ^
ield on the farm of Mr. F. W.
Rivers near Chesterfield about
! o'clock Thursday afternoon.
Friday morning at 10 o'clock a i
neeting will be held on Mr. *
[J. W. Hancock's farm near Mt.
Oroghan. Friday afternoon a
meeting will be held on Mr. J. W.
Terry's farm three miles north
jf P^geland- This meeting will
3e about 3 o'clock.
Messrs. Hancock and Terry '
ire growing crimson clover Cn
their respective farms and doing .
it successfully. The meetings
ire held on the farms rather ,
than in town so that the speak- \
ers may demonstrate what they
say about the benefits of crim ^
son clover and other cover
zrops.
It is desired that just as many (
farmers as possible will be at .
these meetings.
Mr. Tiller is laying special j
stress on the seeding of crimson ^
clover in the sections where j
there is red land. Clover is at j
tiome in red soil and makes its
t>est showing there. He is also j
emphasizing the importance of
selecting the seed corn for next
year in the field.

Cheraw Chronicle.
Mastin Fuller, colored, lies
lead this morning as a result of
fooling with an unloaded pistol. *
Last night Fuller took his girl to J
in entertainment and as is generally
the case with young
iegro bucks, he had a pistol
ilong. On their return home
Fuller was showing his girl how
tiie pistol worked. He was ad I
vised bv several in the crowd to
?ut it up. He "broke" the pis ;
ol and emptied out the car
ridges, but in some.manner one j
>f the cartridges stuck and when j
Fuller snapped the pistol this !
cartridge fired and the bullet en- !
ered his eve and passed entire- 1
v through his head. Death was J
nstantaneous. Coroner Atkin- v

norning and the verdict was (
hat Fuller came to his death by
i pistol shot wound, inflicted by
lis own hand.

Vilson Defends 8-Hour Law In
Opening Speech
Long Branch, N. J., Sept. 23.?
Resident Wilson today actively
>pened his campaign for rejection
with a speech replying
o Republican criticism of his
ettlement of the recently threatmed
railroad strike. With em>hatic
gestures, before a large
:rowd assembled at Shadow
^awn, he defended the eightlour
day law and declared also
hat the Nation must be freed
rom the possibility of interfer;nce
with its commerce. Busiless
men from various parts of
S'ew Jersey often interrupted
he President with hand clapping
ind cheering.
"The chief cloud that is upon
he domestic horizon is the un;atisfactory
relations of capital
ind labor," the President said,
?dding that "so long as labor and
:apital stand antagonistic, the
nterests of both are injured, antl
he prosperity of America is held
>ack from the triumphs which
ire legitimaetly its own."
Mr. Wilson spoke of the bright
iuture for America business, and
hen launched directly into a
iiscussion of the railroad situaion.
Without directly mention
ng Charles E. Hughes, the Republican
nominee, the President
Drought in the Republican party
py saying that about seventy
Republicans supported the eighttour
law in the House of Representatives,
and Senate Repubicans
put no obstacle in the way
>f the passage of the measure.
"This was because the proposil
was reasonable and was based
jpon right," asserted Mr. Wilson.

"Why do you think your husband
always tells you the tauth?"
ioubted the neighber.
"Because," replied the wife,

le wouldn't lie about lesser
natters."
