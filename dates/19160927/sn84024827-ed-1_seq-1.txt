(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Sept 26. With
the announcement by the labor
leaders that approximately 250,
000 union workers would quit
their places tomorrow t0 aid the
striking carmen, the labor situa
tion in New York had reached an
acute s(age.
It was asserted that 6000 brew
ery wlrkers, 115,000 employes in
the building trades, and 250,000
members of the United Hebrew
Trades were in favor of a sympa
thetic strike.
Twelve thousand teamsters also
were reported ready to quit work on
Thursday or Friday. A meeting of
the executive council of the building
trades will be railed for Thursday to
, take final action, after the? business
agents in Manhattan and the Bronx
bad voted for a strike.
Mayor Mitchel summoned the labor
lep tiers before htm as soon as he
beard of their plans. He said he de
sired to be informed directly as to
what might be expected tomorrow.
The union officials, he announced,
told him they expected 200,000 work
ers to strike "as a starter."
After a meeting of the committee,
strikers were supplied with pamphlets
for distribution through the city.
Blame Wall Street
"Rockefeller, Morgan and their
assistants control the transit of
the city," the. pamphlets read,"
and they also control the railways
mines, industries and public utili
ties throughout the country as
well as most of the banks and
nearly all of the money."
Legislature May Meet
Members of the state ' legislature
from this city who called on Governor
Whitman late today and urged him to
convene the senate and assembly to
an extraordinary session to deal with
the strike situation, submitted a draft
of a proposed arbitration act
Governor Opposed Now
The governor, although opposed to
calling the legislature together at this
time, studied the proposed law care
fully and said he believed there was
"room for it on the statute books.?
Would Force Arbitration
The act outlined would provide a
fine of $5,000 and revocation of the
license of a corporation that breaks
an agreement to arbitrate and a fine
against the union breaking such agree

CHARGES OF KILLINGS
MADE BY BOTH SIDES
Commission Gets Down to
Actual Consideration of
Co-operation Plan for First
Time in Conference.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW LONDON, Conn., Sept. 26.
The revision of American neutrality
! laws, with a view to discouraging Am
ericans from participating in Mexican
factional conflicts was suggested at
! the conference of the Mexican-Ameri
can) Joint commission today. It was
indicated that Mexico would be able
to deal more effectively with rebels
and ordinary bandits or outlaws if the
neutrality laws were amended In our
country to make it an offense for an
American citizen to participate in any
way in a movement against a govern
ment with which the United States is
at peace.
The discussion of the neutrality
laws of both countries was Incident
to consideration of plans for the co
operation of the authorities of both
countries in maintaining peace along
the border.
Mexico's Alibi
The Mexicans charged that the In
adequacy of the American neutrality
laws made possible the propaganda of
revolutions on American soil against
the established government in Mexi
co. The consideration of operation of
neutrality laws was not confined to
those facts, however.
Both Charge Killings
The American commissioners sub
mitted a list of border raids that had
been compiled by the war department
The Mexican commissioners counter
ed by the presentation of another list
specifying instances where American
soldiers or civilians bad crossed the
boundary into Mexico. This list also
contained instances where Mexican
nationals were said to have lost their
lives and property on American soil.
At Work At Last
It was said that today's session was
the first or a series in which it was
expected the suggested form of co
operation between the two govern
ments in preventing border disturb
ances would be considered.
Two more sessions will be held here
but without Luis Cabrera, head of the
! Mexican commission. Business in
Boston made it necessary for him to
go there late today.
Mining Men Are Heard
The Americpw members of the com
mission studied a long memorandum
today submitted by a group of mining
men, relative to conditions in Mexico
that, they claim, arc such as to make
perilous the resumption of mining op
orations. MANSFIELD LEADING

COLORADO SPRINGS, Sept 26.
All four national candidates of the
Republican and Democratic parties
were heartily arraigned for their atti
tude on the liquor question by J.
Frank Hpnly today when the Prohibi
tion train started Its two day tour of
dry Colorado. Ira Landritb. Hanly's
running mate, also scored Wilson.
Hanly flayed Wilson for bis failure
to state whether, the California wets
were representing him correctly as
being opposed to phohibition; declar-
; ed that as a result of having obtained
the repeal of te local option laws in
Indiana, Vice President Marshall has
"blood on his hands"; assailed
Huehes for not coming to the aid of
the dry forces and urged Coloradoans
to demand an expression from Fair
tanks on the liquor question when he
enters the state tomorrow. Most of
Hanly's fire was directed at Wilson
in connection with the President's
declaration yesterday that th's na
tion's timidity in the face of foreiett i
competition was all that he ever had
been ashamed of in America.
"Here we have it pt ?ist, from the
President's own lips." Hanly declared
at Trinidad. "He is not ashamed of
t,e ai0ohol liquor traffic with Its de-
counties out of the ninety-two in the
state had stood dry and eliminated
3.000 saloons, on the ground that as
governor of the state he was unable
to enforce the law.
"Upon his recomnenc'ation the law
was repealed and 2.000 licensed sa
loons returned to the state. There is
blood on his hands. A damned spot
that will not out."
! "Mr. Fairbanks will come and go
I without telling you where he stands,"
Hanly told his audience.
Raton. N. M., had the first speech
today. Entering Colorado, stops were
mnde at Trinidad, La Junta, Rocky
Ford. Pueblo and Colorado Springs,
i The train will stop in Salida, Lead
'vllle, Glenwood Springs and Grand
Junction tomorrow, leaving here early
in the morning.
Colorado will vote this fall on a
proposal to permit the sale or beer

The order affects Battery B, the

will make the hike in one day as all

B will not get away until Saturday
morning, the battery likely taking two
days to the hike.
, Explanation Scant
No explanation was available at

the move presumably was to afford
the guards better training facilities.

So far as is known the Warren Dis

Saturday, although considerable de

PARIS, Sept 26. A semi-official

prisoners, removed 40,043 wounded
and taken 144 cannon, most of them
of heavy calibre, 600 machine guns
and other material.

hike of over 150 miles in seven
days of marching.
While the march of the Arizona

than 20 miles daily, in heavy
marching order.
The guards left Naco last Wed

ing by way of Hereford, Lewis
