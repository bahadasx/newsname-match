Internat i-tiiil News Serviee:
WASHINGTON'. Sept. 27. The
war department today ordered 10,
0U0 additional coast artillerymen,
infantrymen, cavalrymen and en
gineers of the national guard from
all parts of the L'nited .States to the
Mexican border immediately. A
similar number of militia infantry
men now on the bonier will be re
leased from service upon the ar
tival of the new troops.

Imperative pressure again is be
ing exerted to swing Gen. Carranza
in line for withdrawal of his de
mand that the American expedition
now
in Mexico be ordered back
across the border. In addition he
has been told that unless his sub
ordinate activity and check the rap
idly spreading bandit movements at
many points, it may be necessary to
strengthen the American unit rather
than to weaken it.
Is Disquieting.
The general Mexican situation
continues disquieting. Although th
state department has take sharp is
sue with Gen. George F.ell in the
hitter's statement that Villa actually
entered Chihuahua City, the mili
tary branch of the government
unanimously upholds the Kl Paso
commander. However, as a result
of the serious differences in the re
ports of the state department and
the army officers on the border, it is
expected that Sec'y of War Laker
will again order all messages from
Gen. Funston and his subordinates
Ambassador-Designate Arredondo
expects to confer with Carranza in
Mexico City within the next 10
days, according to the officials of
tl e Mexican embassy here. It is
epetted that the influence of the
Mexican diplomat will be thrown on
the side of a modification of the
withdrawal demand. At the same
time Sec'y of State Lansing will re
ceive first hand information of ex
act conditions in .Mexico from
Thomas Hohler, the Lritish charge
there, who now is on his way to this
city.
The state department t.tis with
out confirmation early today of the
reports that the garrisons at Vera
Cruz had revolted against Carranza
rule and had declared the : ue in

Farming Course
To Be Added
By Notre Dame
The council of the Holy Cross
congregation will meet Thursda
morning and make final plans for
the erection of a new ehemistr
hall. The new building will also
contain a department of agriculture.
The addition of this, course has been!
discussed for some time at the uni
versity, but owing to the fact that
no building was available it was
dropped. Since agricultural students
will use the chemistry building for
their major subjects, the adding of
an agricultural building to the
chemistry building will be very con
venient. The new building will be erected
in either of two sites. The first is
the site of the old building and the
second is near the shops. If the
building is erected near the shops
this will be the first departure from
the old quadrangle system and the
start of the plan of having build
ings nearer the city.
According to the present plan the
building 'will be a three-story struc
ture and will have a large basement
for the storing of chemicals.
THEN ENDS LIFE
Man is Killed and Woman Reg

riously Wounded.
PHILADELPHIA. Pa., Sept. 27.
Deep mystery today surrounded the
killing of J. C. Graveur, president
of the Alharnbra garage of New
York, and the wounding of a wom
an who was registered as his wife
in the hotel Walton, by a .woman
said to be Mrs. J. C. L.'dur of New
York. The tragedy occurred in a
suite on the ninth floor of the hotel,
while more than 150 men and wom
en danced on the roof garden just
above.
Graveur was shot through the
heart and died instantly. Mrs.
Graveur, with a bullet in her breast,
staggered from the room and up a
flight of stairs. She is in the Jeffer
son hospital here in a critical con
dition. After shooting the couple
Mrs. Ladur shot herself through tho
temple and fell dead by the side of
Graveur. The police say jealousy
was the cause of the woman's act.
She is said to have traced Graveur
and his companion in Atlantic City,
where they had spent several days
before coming to this city.
The mystery may be cleared up
with the arrival here today from
New York of Graveur's sister.
Though facing death from bullet
wounds and staunchly withstanding
all "third degree" efforts of detec
tives, the "woman of mystery" re
fused today to disclose her Identity,
determined, the police believe, to
shield her family and save her
name.
"I have nothing to say." the mys
terious woman told Magistrate
Rooney at the hospital.
"You know you are going to die.
don't you? a detective asked. The
woman, beautiful and not more than
HO, regarded the questioner with the
flicker of a weary smile, and reiter
ated: "I have nothing to say."
Two policemen were left stationed
at her bedside.
