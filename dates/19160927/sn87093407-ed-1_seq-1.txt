THOSE CAUGHT IN
OFFICE EASTER,
NICE, HE SAYS
Bert L Swezea, Seattle clubman, whose defense
against his wife's suit for a divorce consisted in part
of charges that she was friendly with other men, was
severely grilled Wednesday by Calvin 1.. Hall, attorney
for Mrs. Swezea. during cross examination and Swezea's
picture of himself as a patient husband was badly
marred at noon.
Swezea's memory, which has been strikingly bril
liant during his direct testimony while recounting deeds
uncomplimentary to his wife, took a turn for the worse.
He was unable to remember incident after incident.
Swezea admitted he discharged Cal Dubel, the
chauffeur ordered to watch his wife, because he thought
Dubel double-crossed him when Dubel brought Mrs.
Swezea into his office last Easter morning while he
was entertaining two gay, young women with booze.
Attorney 11*11 ae*e<t Swezea *ho
the women were that wen- in the
office
' They were friend* «if m'ue from
Tacoma." Swezea said.
Says Thsy Were Nice
"Were they niee women*" Hall
1 asked
"Surely they were." said Swe
zea
Mall asked Swezea If there wasn't
a deml)ohn of whisky It the room
and If the women weren't smoking
cigar em
The defendant denied that the
women touched anything He ad
mitted taking them to dinner that
night, and later to Tacona
"They were wrecked from the
scene my wife created,' Swezea
said.
Visits "Second Cousin"
In explanation of the visit* Swe
des has t«en making for several:
years to a woman In her apart-;
ments on 10th ave. 8. Swerea ex
plained that she was a second
cousin to him
"I did not let my wife know, be
cause she would make a torn." he
said
Sw-Miea eatcused an auto ride In
which he was discovered bv G«orge
Kearney, a garage man. by saying
It was just an accidental trip.
Heatedly he declared that Kear
ney had attempts to force him to
pay $100 to keep from squealing.
"It was a harmless trip, and I had
had trouble wltn Kearney."
Attorney Mall questioned Swesea|
regarding * certain young milliner i
In SeattlA. whose name, he aald. j
he had promised to keep out of the |
trial unless it waa absolutely nec-;
essary to disclose it, and whom (
Swesea had been calling on for sev
eral months.
Took Out Milliner
"thdn'l you take this milliner
on an auto trip to Snoqualmie
Palls?" Kail asked
"I can t exactly say ahe waa a
milliner." Swesea retorted, holly.
"Was she a cousin also?"
Swetea's attorney objected to |
the questioning
"Have you ever taken this wom
an out to dinner?"
Took Her to Chicken Dinner
"Yes. several times. I have tak
en her to Jack Ilabb's Chicken Din
ner Inn."
Swesea was forced to admit he
had tnade a misstatement during*
the oarller days of the trial, when!
he said that Ills wife had objected
to having children of her own.
Hall produced a letter written by
Swezea to Ills wife, In which he
had admitted tliut It was his desire
to have a child and to help his wife
In the future to get along.
Life Was "Hell"
At one time during the grilling,
Swaxes blurted out that his life
during the last II years had been a
hell
He admitted he had hid his vest,
which his wife had torn during a j
struggle, for the sole purpose of!
using it at some future date as dl-1
vorce evidence.
This vest «'ns laid aside at a time
«hen Swesea hud just promised
Mrs Swezea to begin all over
Swesea said that he had offered;
his wife the M.ignolla Bluff home
and $60 a month If she would ob
tain a divorce
"But she hell out for $150, and
we failed to agree," he said.
Clubman Bert Sweiea took
the stand Tuesday afternoon in
defense of the divorce action
filed against him by his wife
and attempted to show that he
was not to blame for all the
marital difficulties in the Swe
zea home.
In fact, he said that If it had
not been for Mrs. Swezea's
mother he would probably not
have lived with his wife after
1904,
"The dear old lady brought
ui together time after time,"
he testified. "On one occasion
after we had been to Tate's
cafe until It closed, w« went to
th« Washington Annex, and
later Mrs. Swezea drove home
In her own car while I went
home in mine- She drove reck
lessly and stalled her machine
In the mud near our home.
"I i ranked It for her while It
was In sear She hobbled the .*hlft>

and she said things about my daugh
ter and my former wife that I
could not bear. r.-»—
"I dressed. and she jumped rat
of bed and scratched my face until
It bled. Her own mother bathed
the blood stains away. Ijiter I had
a picture taken upon my attorney's
advice."
Swezea introduced several thou
sand dollars' worth of bills, part of
which were still un|>ald. as a proof
of his allegations that his wife was
extravagant.
"1 always made a personal boast
that 1 »u at all times able to giv«
