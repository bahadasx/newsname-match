the city and those who live adjacent
to the city will see to it that the
young men and women /who intend
to enroll at some school this fall,
will come to North Star College. If
you enroll here you can be assured
of individual attention, one thing
most schools cannot pretend to offer
its students. Remember, North Star
College offers courses that are up
to-date and practical. We extend
a cordial welcome to all our young
people. Grasp the opportunity when
it presents itself and pursue work
which wilf eventually help you to
make better progress.
The enrollment of students will^,
begin next Monday morning at 8:30
o'clock and will continue all day.nlversary
On Tuesday we will continue to en
roll students, make assignments of
lessons and arrange class work. On
Wednesday morning at 9 o'clock
teachers and students will assemble
for chapel exercises after which the
regular class work will begin.
Electric lights have been installed
in the hall on the second floor and
in the large commercial room.
The students who expect to pursue
the bookkeeping and stenographic
courses will undoubtedly be pleased
with the instruction they will receive
on the latest Edison-Dick Memio
graph.
All of our teachers are expected
to return to Warren this week. We
extend to all of them a hearty wel
come.
Prof. Nelson A. S. Milltr arrived

Miss Alice Ringheim, principal of
the Warren High School, is convinced

placed in the columns of the
Warren Sheaf. Shortly after her
arrival in the city Sept. 7th she lost
her .watch.' An advertisement was
placed in the Sheaf Want Column
and in a short time the watch was
again in her hands, having been re
turned by mail to the Sheaf office

/LEY DEVELOPMENT
ASSOCIATION WILL
MEET INCROOKSTON
President Welter, of the Minneso
ta Red River Valley Development
Association, has issued a call for a
meeting Monday, October 6th, at
the Northwest School of Agriculture,
Crookston, in the interests of the
moment to secure early action upon
the prevention and control of flood
waters1
resulting from the develop-
ment of the many new drainage pro
jects in Minnesota and the Dakotas.
Drainage engineers and legislators
from both the Minnesota and the
Dakota sides of the Red River have
responded to the invitation to meet
with representatives from the Val
ley counties. The Roads and Drain
age committee of the Development
association is actively interested in
the movement and composed as it is
of men throughout the several coun
ties well informed upon the subject,
the meeting should result in ma
terially strengthening the presenta
tion of the proposition to the State
and Federal governments.
There will also be taken up the
matter of more effective control and
eradication of noxious weeds. Agita
tion in this direction is extremely
timely in view of the noticeable
spread of Canadian sow thistle. The
past season has been one peculiarly
favorable to weed growth, and the
experience of the farmers of the
Canadian northwest with this prolific
and hardy pest should be ample
warning to the farming interests of
this section to take vigorous
measures before the weed is allowed
to make disastrous inroads. It is
expected that the meeting will ac
complish the initiation of a move
ment designed to secure the passage
of laws more possible of enforce
ment than the present weed laws.
FIRE PREVENTION DAY
OCTOBER 9, 1H16.
A few years ago a campaign was
started against loss of life and pro
perty from fire by a committee of
publicity and education in Chicago.
The committee proposed a FLv Pre-
c^ean-up day. October ^thrt^en an
of the Chicago conflagra
tion was the day set, and t^-day
nearly every state the Unior ob
serves the day. The day -will be re
cognized this year in Minnesota, and
this department wishes to urge the
observance of the same. Municipal
officers and the press can do much
to awaken the people to the need of
fire prevention. Fire prevention
means good housekeeping: the clean
ing out of attics, store-rooms,
closets and basements, the proper
disposal of rubbish, making heating
plants and stoves safe, repairing de
fective flues and chimneys, repairing
gas fixtures and electric light cords,
and the proper storage of gasoline.
The schools should be urged to
hold appropriate exercises and fire
drills. This department will be
pleased to furnish the school author
ities suggestions for school programs
upon request.
The work on Warren's new hotel
is progressing rapidly. Already the
brick and tile walls for the three
stories above ground are up andalso
workmen are now busy putting on
the roof. Most of the partitions
have ajso been placed. The hotel is
built according to a new style of.
construction, not heretofore seen in
this part of the country. The walls
are of hollow fire proof tiles, one
story-of the front wall and the north
wall faced with brick, on the out
side, while the remaining walls will
receive a coat of stucco. That the
building will be a handsome one and
a credit to the city, is now very ap
parent.
Mr. and Mrs. August Tomlonas,
Jm_
the cit to-day. Mr.m Tomlonas
,one of the fortunate farmers of the
county, as he had about 700 bushels
of wheat left over from last year
and that will help out greatly thru,
the lean year until another crop can
be raised. If every subscriber to the
locals papers were as honest as Mr.this
and Mrs. Tomlonas are, then the
publishers would lose very few acSjostrand
counts due them for subscriptions.

the expenses which otherwise will
be hard to meet' the football
fans turn out as they should Warren

athletic contests of northern Minne
sota.
(SEED GRAIN POOR
EARLY TESTS NEEDED.
On account of the excessively dry
weather this summer and the injury
to grain by rust, much of the seed
wheat, bafley and oats is of poor
quality. Light seed necessarily
means that there is a limited
amount of food material in the seed.
Farmers should be exceedingly care
ful, therefore, to have all see4 tested
for germination before planting. It
will be well, also, to have seed test
early so that good seed may be
obtained if the first tests show poor
germination.
Much of vthe testing can he done
by the farmers themselves, although
the Seed Laboratory, University
Farm, S Paul, Minn., will be very
glad to make any tests free of
charge, for anyone sending in seed.
A good-sized double handful is a
sufficiency large sample to send in
for ttes#ng- Oswald in

CITIZENS SHOULD OBSERVE
FIRE PREVENTION DAY.
Fighting Minnesota's fire tool with
prevention, the year around, the
state fire marshal's department is
making special efforts tha't all pro
gressive towns in the state will ob
serve the fifth annual "Fire Preven
tion Day" on Monday, October 9, as
fixed by proclamation of Governor
J. A. A. Burnquist.
Toward further reducing the an278.84
nual fire loss qf life and property
and ataiing
1n**ttie1
'MiAnesbtar^taife
made-fireproof movement, State Fire
Marshall Robert W. Hargadine sug
gests that in live communities
Mayors will i^sue like proclama
tions urging local celebrations of the
dayfireless celebrations
Civic and commercial organiza
tions will arrange meetings to plan
to make the home town fireproof.
Schools will have appropriate ex
ercisestalks on the danger of the
small boy and match, and like com
binations
Men and women will look about
their homes and clear away attic,
basement, back year or other accu
mulations that make for fire danger.
"If Minnesota people will only
stop to think that the nation's fire
toll is 5,000 lives a year and $500
loss a minute although two-thirds
o the fires are preventable, fire pre
vention day this year will be a big
success in every town" said Fire
Marshal Hargadine. "Every per
son in the state will join in the
movement because sickness and fire
are nearest to themliable to 'strike
home' any day."
Records in the fire marshal's office
show gradual reduction in the fire
losses in Minnesota, and part of the
credit for the showing is given to
the general observance of fire pre
vention day each year in all cities.
