WHY IT IS GOOD FOR
BABY TO CRY
It is good for a baby to cry and
cry violently, sometimes going into
spasms and turning "black in the
face," although this condition fright
ens the inexperienced mother The
New York Medican Journal quotes
v ; th approval, recent arUcle.s on this
h*i ject fo'-n such authorities as
"Pediatrics ' and the "Hospital."
The latter explains the benefit of
crying as follows:
"In children a great change takes
place curing crying in the manner in
which the respiration is carried on.
Respirations are prolonged at times
for as much as half a minute, and
are interrupted by short respirations
During respirations the glotis is con
tracted so that intrapulmonary pres
sure rises considerably, and there
can be little doubt that it is the
equal distributation of the increased
pressure throughout the whole of
the chest leading to dilation of por
tions of the lung that have become
more or less collapsed, that is the ex
planation of the great benefit which
often results from crying, in all j
cases of infantile bronchitis and of
the large discharge of bronchial mu
eus which often follows. \ lll
"Children may become venv blue •
during the paroxyism. hut the deep
respirations, which succeed
restore the circulation to
ter condition than before ir
quence of the larger lung
available.
This docs not mean, of
that whenever a baby cries
be left to weep, for crying
only way of expressing pain
course,
t is to
is the
and it
may he that a pin is sticking into it, ]
or it has an earache of a pain in its j
Tumy. But it means that when there j
is no such extraneous reason for its j
paroxyisms its weeping need

State Board of Affairs Will
Amendment
Push
That the proponents of the
amendment creating the State
Board of Affairs will make a vigor
ous effort to demonstrate the ah
solute necessity for a measure of
this kind, is taken for granted since
some signs of opposition have ap
peared. There seems to be a com
plete misunderstanding of the pur
pose of the amendment, according to
those who believe in it, and who as
serts, without reservation, that the
financial salvation of the state is de
pendent upon the successful out
come of the proposition. They make
the statement that the State of
Louisiana must increase its revenues
or public necessities will be cut off
and a chaotic condition precipitated
which would impair the credit of the
state for years to come. It is pointed
out that the big roads bond issues in
various wards and parishes, would
give the state a wide birth just at
the time when the good road senti
ment is in a raising wave of popular
ity, forecasting definite prosperity
for the country parishes.
Whatever changes made in assess
ments under the amendment, will be
made gradually they assert. The
Board would have to feel it> way
and particularly avoid drastic ac
tion. Their aim is to equalize as
nearly as possible so that the neces
sary burden of taxation will be
equally and evenly distributed.
