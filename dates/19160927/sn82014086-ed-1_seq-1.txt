When there was no longer hope.
French and British troops swept in
from three sides after their capture
of Morvel and Fregicourt, broke
through the German defenses, over
ran the town and carried all before
them. This place, with its marvelous
subterranean passages and powerful
fortifications, had been caught in the
grip of the allies, who, coming from
the north and the south, had already
advanced far beyond it and cut off
communicatioa with the rear except a
narrow strip, which was covered by
the allied guns.
At the end of the fighting the town
was filled with the bodies of Germans
who had fallen fighting, the French
official statement says.
Prior to the Inss of Combles. the
effect of the victories of the French
and Eritish armies in the capture -of
important strategic points on the pre
vious day was reflected in the official
communication issued by the German
war office, which, after the describing
briefly the great artillery bombard
ment of the entente allies, lasting for
four days, and the attack between the
Ancre and the Somme, admits that
"the conquest of the villages on the
line of Gueudecourt must be recog
nized," and adds "but before all we
must think of our heroic troops, who
faced the united Anglo-French prin
cipal forces and the massed employ
ment of material of the whole world's
war industry, iprepared during many
months."
Both Thiepval, at the northwestern
end of the British line, and the for
tified town of Gueudecourt, northwest
of Lesboefs, have also fallen into the
hands of the British. Around the for
mer place many hard battles have
been fought since the inception of the
great entente offensive of July 1. Gen
eral Sir Douglas Haig's men after
capturing Thiepval drove on eastward

HUGHES CHALLENGES THE
WILSON ADMINISTRATION
To Deny That Lind Was Authorized
to Say Huerta Would Be Put Out.
Cleveland, O., Sept. 26. Charles E.
Hughes tonight challenged the admin
istration to deny his charge that John
Lind was authorized by President
Wilson in 191'4 to say to "the minister
from a foreign power to Mexico" that
Huerta would be "put out" of the
presidency of Mexico if he did not vol
untarily get out.
Mr. Hughes issued his challenge in
a speech here before an audience in
the Central armory. In the same
speech Mr. Hughes lauded Myron T.
Herrick, sitting on the platform with
him, for the manner in which he dis
charged the duties of ambassador to
France in the early days of the war
and declared that the appointment of
a man to succeed Mr. Herrick "in a
time of great emergency'" would "ever
remain a blot" on the present adminis
tration." The nominee's, speech here tonight
was the last of eight delivered on the
day of his campaign through Ohio.
Among them was an address at Toledo
before employes of a large automobile
plant, during which a number of the
workmen he.addressed cheared repeat
edly for Wilson. This meeting closed
with a volley of questions from the
edge of the crowd, prompted by his at
tack on the administration of the Ad
amson law and by uncomplimentary
references to the nominee himself.
"What about the Danbury hatters'
case?" was the chief question. One
man started it, others took it up and
when the nominee closed his speech
the words were echoed by many voices.
Mr. Hughes heard the commotion and
thinking that it came from men' on
the edge of the crowd that had not
heard his reference to the Adamson
law, said:
"If 'you will tell my friends over
there what I have said, I think they
will understand my view."
Later Mr. Hughes said he had not
heard the reference to the Danbury
hatters' case.
MANSFIELD WINS IN
BAY STATE PRIMARIES.
Good Sized PJurality. Over -Cele . for
Dem. Gubernatorial .Nomination.
Boston, Sept. 26. Early returns from
today's state primaries indicate that
former State Treasurer- Frederick W.
Mansfield, has been nominated by the
democrats for governor by a good sized
plurality over former Adjutant General
Charles H. Cole.
With about half the election pre
cincts reported at 110 o'clock to
night, Mansfield had a lead of about
6,000 votes, with a prospect that if the
ratio was continued he would roll up a
plurality of approximately 13.000.
State Auditor Alonzo B. Cook ap
peared to have defeated Joseph B.
Brown for the republican nomination
for auditor with a plurality that prom
ised to total 10,000.
These were the only contests for
state offices. The defeat of Cole was
a decided upset from the standpoint of
the predictions of many democratic
leaders who had confidently expected
his nomination. That Mansfield would
have so determined a triumph had not
been claimed by even his own cam
paign managers. He had predicted big
support from the workingmen of the
n?Kl cities and in Lawrence he re
ceived 2,5 1 6 votes against 71$ for Cole.
Boston gave him 4,514 over Cole.
In many places the polls did not close
until 9 or 10 o'clock, and returns were
necessarily late.

pose the sentence and repeatedly ask
ed whether Herman understood what
the effect of his plea w,ou!d be. Her

was guilty, that he shot George Grasci
in as saloon row in this city last May
and 'that he was ready to take hia pun
ishment. He pleaded only to be allow
ed to see his sick wife for a few min
utes, and after sentence was pro
nounced it was said that this request
would be granted before Herman goes
to Wethersfield prison.

MEXICANS SUGGEST REVISION
OF AMERICAN NEUTRALITY LAW
To Discourage America Participat
ing in Mexican Factional Conflicts
New London, Conn., Sept. 26. Re
vision of American neutrality laws,
With, a view.-to. diseOiiragir.g Ameri
cans from 'participation in Mexican
factional conflicts, was suggested at
the conference of the Mexican-American
joint commission today. It was
indicated that Mexico would be able
to deal more effectively with rebels
and outlaws if the neutrality laws
were amended so as to make It an
offense for an American citizen to
participate in a movement against a
government with which the United
States is at ipeace.
The discussion of the neutrality
laws of both countries was incident
to consideration of suggested plans
for co-operation in maintaining peace
along the border.
- The Mexicans charged that the In
adequacy of the American laws made
possible the propogation of conspira
cies on American soil against estab
lished order in Mexico. The consid
eration of neutrality laws was not
confined to those of the United States,
however, The American representa
tives have held to the argument that
Mexico should so govern her frontier
as to make unnecessary the presence
of an American army on the north
side of the boundary line, and atten
tion was directed to the cases in
which the Mexican neutrality laws or
their enforcement was at fault.
The American commissioners sub
mitted a list of border raids compiled
by the war department. The Mexican
commissioners countered by the pres
entation of another list specifying in
stances where American soldiers or
civilians had crossed the boundary
into Mexico. This list also contained
instances where Mexican nationals
were said to have lost their lives and
property on American soil.
