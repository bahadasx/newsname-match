Corn cutting, silo filling, threshing,

THE WAR TODAY
No rest Is being- given the Ger
mans by the victorious Franco
British on the Somme front.
The British capture of Thiep
val, following closely and tinex
jectedly upon the capture of Com
bles by the combined allied forces,
was itself followed up hist night
by a new stroke south of the
Somme, where the French drove
out from Yerniandevillers and
captured a strongly fortitied wood
east of the town.
Apparently this new drive Is
aimed at lhalnes, which bears to
the southern end of the Somme
line somewhat the relation that
Combles did to the northern sec
tor. Belated reports from the British
front todav announce the capture
of btwceii :i,(HM and 4.000 Germans
bv General llaig's forces in the
titrating Monday and Tuesday.
The reported captures by the
French brine this total up to
more than 6.000. I nofficial figures
show the aggregate number of
prisoners taken by the Anglo
French armies during the Somme
offensive from July 1 to date have
been Wl.OOO, with some 190 square
miles of territory and 41 villages.
In Macedonia the entente forces
apparently are encountering a
stiffened Bulgarian resistance, es-
I T.eciallv west of the Yardar re
gion.
Official reports from Bucharest
tike hack nothing of the claims
made bv the Rumanians of a nota
ble victory over Field Marshal
von Mackensen fn the great battle
of last week in Dobrndja.
Greece apparently Is on the
verge of entering- the war on the
side of the allies. Ring- Constan
tino beintr now reported to haTe
consented to such action.
The captnre of Conibles and
Thiepval by the French and Brit
ish on the Somme front continued
today to absorb a large part of the
war news.
The taking of Conibles Is de
clared by French military experts
to liaTe been one of the most bril
liantly executed operations of the
entire summer campaign.
Berlin and Yienna reports tell
of the repul-e of strong Rnsslan
attacks in Yolhynla, Galleia and
the Carpathian mountain region.
On the Humanlan front the Aus
trians and Germans hare been
compelled to eT&euate two passes
in the Transjlvanla Alps In order
to avoid an encircling movement
by the Knmanlans.
Belief Is expressed fn Athens
that the king of Greeco will de
clare war Immediately. Former
J'remler Venizelos is on his way to f
the iland of Crete, presnmahly to
take charge of an insurrectionary
movement that, has for its object
the forcing of the king and the
government to atrree to Greece's
entry Into the war on the lde of
the entente allies

FORCES JOIN REBELS
Dispatch Tells 4,000 Greek
Troops Having Gone to
Revolutionists.
Farls, Sept- 27 (5:30 a. m.)
Four thousand Greek troops in
Canea have joined the revolution
ists, according to a radio agency
dispatch from Athens.
The revolutionary movement is
spreading in Greek Macedonia, in
Crete, the Aegean islands and in
Fpims, says a Havas dispatch
from Athens.
Athens, Sept. 26 (via London, Sept.
27.) In circles very close to King
Constantine the belief is expressed
that he will declare war immediately
possibly even this evening.
Excitement in Athens.
The greatest excitement prevails in
Athens. In some quarters the feel
ing is expressed that M. Venizelos' ac
tion has been hastened by the pros
pect of an early agreement regarding
Greece's entry into the war between
Greece and the entente powers, and
it i3'.ixinsidered that the Cretan now
is playing his last trump in the strug
gle with the king. The information
that an agreement may be reached be
tween Greece and the entente comes
from official sources and is based on
telegrams from Greek ministers in
entente capitals. The entente lega
tions here, however, have not been
advised of any change in the program
of inaction.
The Greek government has submit
ted to representatives of the entente
a proposal that Greece drop her pol
icy of neutrality on condition only
that she be accorded a loan sufficient
to pay for the mobilization and equip
ment of the army.
General Constantine Moschopoulos,
chief of staff of the Greek army, and
F.00 officers have signed a memorial
addressed to the king demanding that
Greece abandon its neutrality in the
war.
One explanation of the departure of
M. Venizelos advanced is that the for
eign powers desire to nominate a pre
fect of Saloniki, thus definitely bring
ing about the separation of the city
from Greece, and that M. Venizelos, to
save Saloniki to Greece, is going to a
conference with the entente allied au
thorities there in an endeavor to ar
range another solution of the situa
tion. DOUBLE SMASH UP

States Catted Out
Special Man
of Carranza
CalledHome
Washington. Sept. 27. Eliseo Arre
dondo, the Mexican ambassador-designate,
now on his way to Mexico City,
is expected by personal conferences,
to give General Carranza a clearer un
derstanding of the American view of
difficulties between the two countries
and state department officials hope he
may be able to convince the first chief
of the necessity of consenting to full
consideration of all issues by the Joint
commission.
Mr. Arredondo left Washington
quietly yesterday afternoon after call
ing on Secretary Lansing, Counselor
Polk and Assistant Secretary Phillips.
He explained to these officials that
General Carranza had requested his
presence in Mexico City.
Secretary Lansing said he had no
direct knowledge of the purpose of
Mr. Arredondo's trip but indicated that
he expected him back in "Washington
within two or three weeks.
General Carranza has shown plainly
recently that he is not in accord with
the American idea of the work under
taken by the Mexican-American com
mission at New London. Officials here
have been puzzled by his notice to
governors of Mexican states that the
commissioners would discuss nothing
beyond the withdrawal of American
troops from Mexico.
Mr. Arredondo's personal status in
this country probably will be con
sidered at his meeting with General
Carranza. For a long time the envoy
has been known to be dissatisfied with
his doubtful position as ambassador
designate and to have desired his ac
ceptance by the state department as
ambassador and the accrediting of
Henry P. Fletcher to Mexico City as
ambassador there. Mr. Fletcher,
though named some time ago, has
been held in Washington pending ad
justment of the relations of this gov
ernment with Mexico.
New London, Conn., Sept. 27. The
Mexican representatives on the joint
com'mistTonxthat is seeking a basis for
an agreement between this country and
Mexico on border control, professed
surprise today that the departure of
Ambassador-Designate Arredondo for
Mexico was attributed in some quar
ters to failure of the commissioners to
agree.
According to their information Mr.
Arredondo's visit to Mexico will be
brief and it is not due to the confer
ence of the commissioners.
When the commissioners meet to
day the consideration of the different
plans suggested for a better control of
the border was continued.
I0WAN IS LATEST
BLACKMAIL DUPE
KIch Widower, Whose Name is With
held, Said to Have Been Fleeced
Out of 10,000.
Chicago, Sept. 27. Investigation of
a new blackmail plot involving a rich
iowan who is alleged to have been
fleeced out of $10,000, was started by
federal officials today.
The method of extortion was de
clared to be the same as that em
ployed in the so-called $1,000,000 black
mail syndicate, agents of the federal
department of justice said. Two
young women and a Chicago attorney
are involved. Neither their names
nor the names of the Iowa victim will
be made public until the arrests are
made.
The Iowa merchant, who is a wid
ower, is said to have been surprised in
a compromising situation and his ar
rest followed by a man posing a3 a
government agent. Pleadings of his
companion led to the suggestion, fed
eral officials said, that the affair
might be adjusted by the payment of
money. The Iowan paid.
LIFE LONG REPUB
SUPPORTSWILSON
John I. Curtin, Chicago, In City on
Business, Says He and Seven Sons
Will Aid Democrats.
J. D. Curtin, Chicago, who is in
the city on business, declared yester
day at the New Harper, where he is
registered, that, although he is a life
long republican, he and his seven sons
expect to vote for Woodrow Wilson
for president.
"I consider Wilson the most remark
able man that this country has pro
duced in the last half century," he
stated in explaining his decision to
support the democratic candidate for
the presidency. "With tho constant
attacks made by Hughes, Wilson is a
martyr, and the American people
ought to thank God of the opportunity
afforded to keep a man of his high
Ideals and broad statesmanship in of
fice. This is the first time I have ever
even thought of not voting the repub
lican ticket in a national campaign,
but feel that under the circumstances
that every loyal American should
stand firmly behind Wilson, regardless
of past party affiliation."

125,000 ANSWER CALL
Leaders Claim That Number
Have Responded to Sum

New York. Sept. 27. Tnfon
workers to the number of 125.000
went on strike today in sympathy
with the striking traction em
ployes, according to figures given
out at a meeting of representatives
of labor unions.
New York, Sept. 27. The general
strike of labor unions in sympathy
with the striking street car men was
supposed to be effective today and al
though labor leaders claimed that
some 125,000 workers had responded to
the call, there was little evidence that
a strike was in progress.
Private canvassers reported that at
least 22 unions had failed to respond
to strike calls this forenoon. The on
ly report received at police headquar
ters was that 250 members of the
painters' union had refused to report
for work.
Today leaders estimated about
125,000 trade unionists have responded
to their call.
These were the figures reported to
the meeting by ' the union delegates,
according to Ernest Bohm, state or
ganizer of the American Federation
of Labor.
The trades which have responded
to the strike call, he said, are the Uni
ted Garment Workers, six building
trades unions, the paper hangers un
ions, painters, house wreckers and a
number of small organizations.
Bohm declared that 263,000 more
would go out tomorrow.
List of Sympathizers.
Among the organizations which
have voted to strike today, according
to union officials are: Ladies' Garment
Workers, 95,000; Clothing Workers,
40,000; Painters and Decorators,
15,000; Furriers, 15,000; Tinsmiths,
10,000; butchers, 10,000: stationary
firemen, 2,500; paper box makers,
7,000; milliners, 6,000; jewelry work
ers, 3,000; brewery workers, 6,000. To
tal 209.500.
The leaders asserted they would be
able to call out an additional 100,000
more daily for the next two or three
days.
Far less than 125,000 union em
ployes responded to the call, accord
ing to police reports. The officials
said, however, that it was difficult to
obtain an accurate estimate and de
clined to fix a definite figure.
BANKERS FAVOR
CHANGE IN LAWS

Becommend Shifts in Certain
Rulings.
Kansas City, Mo., Sept. 27. Recom
mendations for changes in the na
tional banking and federal reserve
acts were expected to be made here
today by bankers attending the annual
convention of the American Bankers'
association.
This action was to come up before
the national bank section, following
last night's meeting addressed by John
Skelton Williams, comptroller of the
currency, and was to concern consoli
dation into the federal reserve board
of the offices and jurisdictions under
the old national banking acta that are
partially duplicated by the newer sys
tem. The discussion was to embrace an
immediate retirement of green backs
and a gradual withdrawal of national
bank notes in favor of the more recent
reserve currency, return to members
of the reserve system of part of their
subscriptions, and making membership
In it optional for banks with a surplus
of less than $100,000.

Front Claim
Bucharest. Monday, Sept. 25, (via
London, Sept. 27, 10:59 a. m.) De
tails of the great battle on the Dobrud
ja front which lasted from Sept. 17 to
Sept. 19 and ended, according to Gen
eral Averesco, in the decisive defeat
of the Germans and Bulgarians, are
given in an official statement Issued
by the war office today. The state
ment says:
"The supreme command learned on
Sept. 17 that detachments of our
forces had been compelled to retire
before superior enemy forces and were
falling back slowly, inflicting heavy
losses on the enemy. Measures were
taken to meet the situation and a des
perate battle began on a front stretch
ing from the Danube to the Black sea.
"The fighting opened along the Dan
ube where enemey columns consisting
mostly of Germans endeavored to
force their way into Chernavoda. This
effort was defeated by the Rumanians
who, with repeated bayonet attacks
supported by the fire of three monitors
in the river, halted the advance of the
enemy.
"In two days of desperate fighting
the enemy suffered heavy losses, his
massed formations being mowed down
by artillery fire. In the center he was
driven from trenches which he mo
mentarily succeeded in penetrating by
the allied Rumania, Russian and Serb
ian troops.
"Finally at 9 o'clock p. m., Sept. 19,
the enemy onslaught reached Its cli
max. The allies by a formidable coun
ter attack overthrew the enemy's
right wing which fled in disorder. The
enemy losses were very great, every
where heaps of corpses were found
and in front of one division alone 5,000
rifles were picked up. The allied
troops then advanced, driving the ene
my before them."
Sofia, Sept. 27. (via London, 12:15 p.

between Serbian and Bulgarian troops
on -tbi. western end of the Macedonian

British Front in France. Sept. 26.
(via London, Sept. 27, 4:05 a. m.)
The capture of Combles was one of
the most picturesque incidents in the
whole course of the great Somme of
fensive. It marked the opening of
today's forward surge of the British
and French forces which reached its
climax in the capture of Gueudecourt
and Thiepval.
All night long bitter fighting had
been in progress and with dawn the
battle broadened to include the whole
British left. Combles fell as the sun
rose on a perfect summer day. In the
early hours of the morning the British
took an orchard in the northern out
skirts and then, after a heavy pre
liminary shelling, they charged the
trenches on the edge of the village.
The trenches were empty when they
reached them. At the same time' the
French, dashing forward on the other
side of the village, pushed victoriously
forward into the heart of the village.
Head and Wounded in Piles.
Combles had a labyrinth of dugouts
and well fortified cellars but at the
last practically no defense was made.
Those Germans who had not managed
to escape when the town was hope
lessly surrounded were taken prisoner.
Cellars and dugouts were full of
wounded.
Having cleared Combles of any
stray Germans the British and French
moved on side by side to further at
tacks. One of the most striking features of
the fighting last night and today was
the surprisingly slight resistance of
fered at Morval and Combles by the
Germans, according to British officers.
Some German trenches taken yester
day were lightly occupied or not at all.
In other instances the allied com
manders stated that considerable
bodies of Germans threw down their
rifles promptly as soon as the attack
ers approached their trenches.

Yesterday the British found the

Both today and yesterday the Ger
mans showed an inclination to with
draw their guns Immediately they
