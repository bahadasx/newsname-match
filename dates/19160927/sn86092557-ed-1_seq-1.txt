Many Other Matters Were
Discussed at Last Night's
Meeting.
Marlon County** Medical Society ie
stirred to action by the censure ol
the state health department In regard
to the laxners of the Marlon county
. physician* in reporting births and
deaths and tranamlseable diseases. At
the regular meeting last night a committee
was' appointed to investigate
i the matter and see what can be done
to remove this stigma from the doctors.
Most of those present seemed
to think that the criticism of the state
hdalth department directed at this
county was uncalled for end unjust
In many instances.
A committee composed of Drs. L. N.
Yost, W. U. Sands and J. A. Graham
was appointed to look into this matv
ter and to make a report to the assoclatlon
at the next meeting. Court records
will be examined and other measures
taken to lind out It the physicists
of this county have been negligent
in the fulfillment of their duties
in this reBpect. If such is found to be
the case steps will be taken by the
I . association to remedy the matter and
bring about a better state of affairs In
this particular,
ft.;, "Infantile Paralysis" was the subt
ject of an excellent paper read last
/' night before the Marlon County MedlfC**4MMM?el*tlon
by Dr. C. R. Welrich
I. . . of'the state health department 01

g^tHTthe state department of Preventatp
me Diseases, had just returned from

BEI^jiwhe time in study with the best au
thorltles on the disease in that city
jjg and his paper iast night was replete
??' ' with information as to the prevention
Sj?: ol the disease. A large number of the
g-'ov members of the Medical society were
ijf r. out last night for the meeting and all
the nurses of Cook hospital were presant
to hear this address,
ffvc ' Another meeting which was considSfe'.'ered
by the association was the raislisj
of funds and napping out of a program
for the entertainment of the
SB' ' 1917 convention of the West Virginia
K Medical association which meets in
if*.-; this city in October, 1917. It is the
jf'?- plan of the asociatiou to make thlB
*; ihe biggest and best convention of the
H' organization ever held in the state.
^ ''The date of the 1917 meeting was
;< ' changed from May until October on
jKSt account of lack of hotel facilities as
Kif it, Is believed by that time the "Fair?v.\.
mont" hotel will have been tlnlshed.
S,"*-.. it Is expected that approximately 400
medical men from various parts of
K.i the state will gather here for the cong,,"renUon.

Have Won Most Brilliant
Success of the Summer
Campaign,
FRENCH PAPERS ELATED
Believed That Germans Will
Soon Shorten Their
Line.
(By Associated Press)
PARIS, Sept. 27.?A brilliant French
attack eaBt of Vermand-Oviliers has
been succeeded In capturing a strongly
fortified wood according to an official
statement issued by War office
today.
The capture ot Combles with its
great booty completes what Is regarded
by military experts as one of
the most brilliantly executed operations
of the Bummer campaign. The
whole front of attack from Martinpuich
to the Sorame has been pushed
forward uniformly for more than a
mile.
Military observers declare that the
fullness of the success proves that
the allies are contestably masters
of the situation. Since September 17
the Germans have brought up three
fresh divisions against the French
front. On the 20th they made a desDerate
effort to retake Bouchavesnes
Not only did they (ail but Ave days
later the British assuming the offensive
hurled back the line In spite of
the fact that considerable advantages
of terrain were considered to be with
the Germans.
The progress made by the French
beyond Bouchazesnes is regarded here
as one of the most surprising results
of the operation. French officers declare
that this success demonstrates
the growing power of the French offensive
and the failing reslstence of
the Germans.
The hills which surround this village
were swept or. three sides by
all German artillery from St. Pierre,
Vaast wood in the north to Mont St.
Quentln in the south. Nevertheless
they were stormed and the capture of
Hill 130 which threatened directly Allaines
paves the way for a vigorous
developing movement around Mont St
Quentin and Peronne. The newspapers
compare the present offensive
with the bloody and futile attempt of
the French to break through the German
line in Artols and Champagne
last year and expressed the greatest
optimism over the present situation.
All of the military writers in the newspapers
agree that the results of Monday's
and Tuesday's fighting are
among the most important gained in
the whole series of battles on the
Somme front. They point out that
the recent successes have considerable
practical value and that generally
the situation has been sensibly modi
Iflari a rnnapniionm urtiinVi tYinw aov
' will soon be evidenced. The phrase
1 In the official statement of Berlin "we
are obliged to admit the success of
1 obtained by our adversaries," Is Inter'
preted by many newspapers as a sign
' that the Germans know that the Allies
1 are getting the upper and and are
trying to explain It by declaring that
' the whole resources of the world are
being used against them.

SOFIA. Sept 27.?After ten days ot
heavy fighting between Serbian and
Bulgarian troops on the western end
of the Macedonian front the Bulgarians
forced back tbeir opponents, compelling
them to retreat along the
whole front it was said officially today.
LONDON. Sept 27.?Between 3,000
and 4.000 prisoners were taken by
the British in Monday's and Tuesday's
fighting on the Somme front, according
to a delayed portion of GenOFM
Hale's report on Tuesday night which
was given oat today.
PARIS, Sept 27.?The Serbians
have repulsed three violent Bulgarian
attacks on Kalmakcalan heights according
to an official statement issued
by the War office dealing with the Salonlkl
front
The papers exultantly sum up the
result to date of the great offensive
as 4 villages and 190 square miles
of territory conquered and 60,000 prisoners.
LONDON, Sept. 27.?Five more
Somme towns, Including the strong
redoubt created by the Germans at
Combles, have come into the possession
of the Allies the ,last 24 hours.
German losseB have been terrific. Already
2,300 German prisoners have
been captured.
The town of Combles is entirely in
the hands of the Anglo-French forces.
This is announced In the official statement
from the French' War office tonight,
which adds that the battle
north of the Somme is going in favor
of the Allies.. The French also
have advanced further north of Frelglcourt.
Along the Bethune road the
French have gained additional ground.
A vast stock of munitions and provisions
was captured In Combles, tbe
statement says, and the town was filled
with Greman dead.

Frank Ellison and wife and small 1
son, also "Pluto" a dog, have just
finished a trip in a prairie schooner 1
from Illinois to Fairmont. They made c
the trip over all kinds of roads, the 1
party sleeping in the schooner at
night and traveling along in the day
time. "Pluto" was chained to the J
wagon and wag well able to keep up
with Nick and Nigger, two large mules
which were the means of locomotion.
They came to Fairmont to live and
forever after be happy. Ellison says (
that he had two horses but sold them
and would have sold the mules but
could not get as much as he thought
Nick and Nig were worth So just decided
to drive them through.
Almost a month was consumed on
the trip and the family slept in the
canvas covered schooner on the trip
east as their ancestors slept when on
the western trip nearly 100 years ago.
Ellison will likely use his mules here and
do hauling and transfer, work to
support his family. The land he left
in Illinois was near the border of Indiana
and of very poor quality.

By Hughes Alliance Enrollment.
V
fENHESSEuT DOUBTFUL
Even Florida Shows Evidence
of Disgust Over
Conditions.
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
NEW YORK. Sept. 27.?A surprlsng
anti-Wilson sentiment throughout
he South is Indicated by the enrollnent
campaign ot the National Hughis
Alliance. From its headquarters
lere the Alliance is conducting the
nost comprehensive coupon enrollnent
i tipalgn of a political nature
iver undertaken in this country. It is
lased on a series of striking adverisements
which the Alliance is placng
in weekly and monthly periodicals
tnd magazines.
The llrst of the advertisements, a
ihort appeal based on Hughes.' record
is Governor of the state of New York
ind calling for "a great President for
i great crisis," appeared in only a tew
veoklles and magazines three weeks
igo. Each advertisement was accomisnled
by the coupon, giving an oplortunity
for enrollment in the Alllince.
The magazines were scarcely on
isle before the signed coupons began
louring into headquarters.
From the very start the extraordilary
proportion ot enrollments from
Southern States was onted. At first
vhen the returns showed Southern
inrollments exceeding twenty-flve per
lent, it suggested that the magazines
nust have been placed on sale In
Southern States earlier than through
he North; but the proportion lncreasid
to about 33 1-3 per cent as the days
lassed and it became evident that
here was an extraordinary strong unlercurrent
of sentiment for Mr. Hughis'
candidacy south of the Mason and
lixon line.
A great deal of evidence rapidly acinmulated
to show that tbe enrollnents
were not merely from the small
iroportion of the population which
labltually voted the Republican tickit
in Southern States but represented
nen in all walks of life from the highist
to the lowest. Particularly strikng
was the response from substanlal
business men; bankers, mannfacurers,
wholesale and retail merihants,
officers and employees of railoads,
Insurance and real estate agints
and farmers were represented in
arge number. Many of them were
iccompanied by letters from life-long
democrats who felt it necessary to
ixplain why they were supporting
iughes in this campaign. Many of
hese reiterated their faith In the
Democratic party, but insisted that
'resident Wilson had betrayed his
tarty. Many indicated also that their
'Ote for Mr. Hughes would be the ony
point at which they would separite
from their party and that locally
hey would vote the Democratic tickit.
One man wrote across hie coupon,
I am still a Democrat," underscoring
he word "still." Another wrote, "I
ought through the Civil wftr in the
Confederate Army and I have voted
or every Democratic president since,
ncluding Bryan, but I cannot vote for
i craven coward like Wilson who
ruckles to a lot of walking delegates."
L large number of the letters refer
lirectly to the President's action in
egard to the Adamson bill as a deermlning
factor in Inducing them to
upport Governor Hughes.
In the Southwost, particularly in
Texas, Arizona and New Mexico,
ifhere the enrollments have been very
arge, the signers have indicated that
he administration's lack of a conistent
Mexican policy was a deterolntng
factor in their attitude. The
nrollments in the Alliance from Texis
is one of the largest from any state
n the Union. It Includes half a dozen
