Died ai Pellyton.
Mr. Walker Absher, a man 66 years
of age, died at Pellyton Sunday, Sept.
17, 1916, of a complication of diseases,
therefore his. death was not unexpect
ed, though skilled physicians and lov
ing friends did all In their power to
restore him to health, but to no avail,
and he died as he had lived peaceful
ly. In early life he professed his faith
in Christ and united with the Baptist
Church and lived a consistent Christ
ian till the end came. The family has
lost a devoted husband and father, the
community a good citizen. He was
honest and industrious and had ac
cumulated considerable of this world's
goods. Every body thought well of
him and he will be greatly aiissed.
He leaves a wife and several chil
dren, besides a host of relatives and
friends to mourn their loss. May the
Giver of all that is good comfort and
console those who have been so sorely
bereft.
funeral services were conducted by
Rev. Moxley and the interment was
in the Pellyton grave jard in the
presence of a large crowd of sorrow
ing friends and loved ones

few years f ter their union they re
moved to Texas where they resided
until death called the wife. Besides
the huband she left four children, the
last one being born a day or two .be
foretbe demisef the mother. Rela

sending condolence to the stricken hus

especially when you consider the little
ones who are to go through life with
out the protecting care of mother.

B. H. Gilpin.
Twenty years or more ago Mr. B. H.
Gilpin took up his residence in Carnp
bellsville, being employed as a sales
man in a dry goods store. He followed
this avocation until about fifteen
years ago when he went on the road.
as a traveling salesman for a whofe
sale grocery house, of Louisville. He
has been almost constantly a commer
cial traveler since that date. He
changed houses several times, as more
lucrative offers came, but he did not
fail to give satisfaction to each estab
lishment for whom he did business.
He now represents the Cumberland
Grocery Company, and his territory is
in this part of the State, embracing
four or five counties. He makes Co
lumbia about every two weeks, and
his face is as familiar here as a native.
He has at all times commanded a good
trade, the country merchants having
the utmost respect for him, relying
upon his integrity, and do not hesi
tate when he presents his price list.
Socially Mr. Gilpin is very compaion
able, every body being his friend.
About twelve years ago he was mar
ried in Burkesville to Miss Letha Law
.horn, a daughter of Mr and Mrs. T.
J. La whom, and about two years ago
their first child was born, a bod, who
is idilized by his loving parents. Mr.
Gilpin and his competitors are on the
most friendly terms, due to the cour
teous manner in which he solicits. He
will probably remain on the road as
long as health and activity will per
mit, and when he retires we trust that
he will have in store a snug sum for
himself and for those he is most deep
ly interested. His form" and carriage
indicate that Father Time has dealt
gently with him May thesamebless
ings continue 'with him to the end is
the wish of this publication, and may
his trade increase-as the country con
tinues its march to prosperity.

Church for twenty-three years.

We are requested by Mr. Reuben
Carter to say on behalf of himself and
his children that they appreciate more

kindness and sympathetic words of
friends on the occasion of their sad
visit to the town.
Judge I. H. Thurman, of Spring,
field, came to Columbia last week and
purchased a one-half interest in Nancy
Monroe, a fine two-year-old combined
mare, from Mr. R. F. Paull, and she
is now in training at Judge Tnurman's
stock farm. This mare was exhibited
at the State Fair, and was admired by
thousands. She was entered in the
two-year-old harness ring and was
awarded second money. She was also
shown in the two-year-old saddle- ring
and won first money- These premiums
were awarded over many competitors,
the best breed in Kentucky. Judge
Thurman has in his employ an ex
perienced trainer, and he will see that
this 'mare has the closest attention.
If no accident should come to her she
will make a record next year that will ;
cause the horse men of the State to
take notice.

Report the Births.
In the endeavor to have a complete
record of all of the births and deaths
of Adair county, the Vital Statistics
Bureau of Kentucky has it's repre
sentative, Gates Young, of Owensbo
ro, Ky., making an inspection of the
various registrar's records, and visit
ing all of the physicians, undertakers,
mid-wives and cemetery sextons in the
county, with the view to have every
one comply with the law. Heretofore
the county's record has been excep
tionally poor in the report of deaths,
and Mr. Young stated that after his
inspection of the county, he would
procure warrants for any one found
violating the law and vigorous prose
cutions would follow.
Kentucky's vital -statistics law has
been in operation since 1912 and near
ly every county in the State has been
complying with it tc the letter, -but
the bureau feels that Adair county
citizens have been negligent in this
matter, and will endeavor to secure
the co-operation of the citizens in gen
eral by publicity and general educa
tion in the usefulness of the records
sought by the law.
The law is one of the most impor
tant on the statute books, and it is "
very necessary that Adair county citi
zens comply with it, as it's enforce
ment means giving the children of the
county their birthright, and may, in
after years, mean money to them, as
it provides a means for their proving
their rights under the laws. It is now
necessary in many States for all chil
dren to have their birth certificates
before leaving or entering school, and
also before securing-employme"nt, and .
this will be the case in Kentucky in
the near future, so the Adair county
parents should see that their chil
dren's births are registered, and also
that all deaths are properly reported.
