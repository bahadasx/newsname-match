Mystery in the disappearance of
Mrs. Eva Stock, wife of Joseph Stock,
a prominent north Shawnee county
farmer living five miles north of this
city on Rochester road, grew deeper
today when a two weeks- search in
two states, Kanpas and Missouri,
proved without result?. The search
was made by her hufband and from
the sheriffs office here. Mrs. Stock
disappeared from home on the morn

Since that hour relatives have not seen
her. The horse and buggy, in which
she came to the city, was found that
afternoon in front of the J. C. Snedi-
ker mercantile store In North Topeka. j
nvestiga-tion reveals the fact that;

Pacific. It is known she left the
train at Junction City but after that
her whereabouts have been swallowed
In mystery.
No Reason for leaving.
No cause for her leaving home can
be given by her husband except ehe
has suffered in the past from mental
troubles. She has, in the last eight
years, taken treatement in the State
hospital and has been treated twice in
private sanitariums.
When she left home, two weeks ago,
so far as her husband knows, she had
$14 in money but friends and relatives
admit she might have had more. Dia
monds which she wore were valued at
between $200 and $300. No evidence
that she sold or pawned the gems has
been found.
Mrs. Stock's former home is in
Maryville, Mo., where she has consid
erable real estate and other property,
including land valued at $40,000. A
search in that vicinity yielded no re
sults. Husband Offers Reward.
When Mrs. Stock disappeared she
wore a tan suit and a black hat with
a black plume. Her hair is brown,
sprinkled with gray, and her eyes are
dark brown. She is five feet and six
inches tall and weighs 165 pounds.
She wore a plain gold watch and
neckchain, a double diamond set ring
and a plain gold wedding ring. She
carried an alligator skin handbag. She
is 45 years old, but looks younger.
The theory that Mrs. Stock met with
accident or foul play, while they ad
mit it is possible, is given but little
credence by the sheriff's force. They
believe her mental troubles were re
sponsible for her act.
Information leading to her where
abouts, according to Mr. Stock, will

1'all Plowing in Oklahoma.
Oklahoma City, Okla., Sept. 27.
Heavy showers of the past two weeks
which have fallen in practically every
section of the state have resulted in
the beginning of fall plowing and
preparation of winter wheat land, ac
cording to President Frank Gault of
the state board of agriculture. Dry
weather delayed the plowing and sow
ing of the bulk of Oklahoma's wheat
land but it is believed the crop will
be almost normal. A detailed report
on this subject will be issued shortly

JEALOUSY BAGKJF TRAGEDY
Couple Motored From Y. to
Philadelphia. .
Affinity in Hospital Refuses to
Tell Her Same.
Philadelphia, Pa., Sept. 27. Death
worte finis across a story of the mad
infatuation of a woman for a man
who loved another when Mrs. Harry
Belzar, 15 Euclid avenue, Brooklyn,
shot to death J. C. Gravier, new York
garage president, probably mortally
wounded a woman who posed as his
wife, and then committed sucide in a
room in the Hotel Walton here early
today.
The mystery that had surrounded
the tragedy was partially cleared
shortly before noon when Mrs. Fran
ces Apman, sister of the dead man,
and Howard Fancey, his partner, ar
rived here and correctly identified the
bodies. The slayer went under the
ias of Mrs. J. C. Ladur and gave her
address as 16 West 120th street. New
York.
The identity of the "other woman
now believed to be dying in Jefferson
hospital, however, remains a mystery.
Mrs. Apman and Fancey denied that
she was Gravier s wife.
Gravier Widower Two Years.
His real wife dlied two years ago,
they said, and detectives are directing
their efforts toward learning who the
dying woman is. It is believed she
comes of a wealthy New York family
and, like Mrs. Belzar, was infatuated
with Gravier.
Magistrate Persch with two police
men are waiting at her bedside in
hopes of getting some statement be
fore her lips are forever sealed. Only
once did she regain consciousness.
Then she was informed of her condi
tion and asked to make an ante-mor
tem statement. A wan smile flitted
across her mouth an instant, she
sighed and said:
please, please go away. , I am so
tired. Don't bother me," and lapsed
into unconsciousness.
Followed Him Everywhere.
For two years, according to Mrs.
Apman and Fancey, Mrs. Belzar had
followed Gravier. She was infatuated
with him and repeatedly he spurned
her love. Finally she became desper
ate and followed him every place he
went. Mrs. Belzar was handsomely
gowned and seems to be always well
supplied with money. She arrived in
Philadelphia Monday. She visited all
of the larger hotels, telling clerks she
was in search of her husband-
Gravier and his companion did not
register until yesterday at the Walton.
Last night Mrs. Belzar ha,d no trouble
in going to their room. A matron saw
her waiting in the hall, and asked her
what she wanted.
"I am waiting for my husband," she
replied.
Guests in other rooms heard no
words. Only the opening of a door,

Funston Finds Americans Started Sa
loon Shooting at El Valle, Mexico.
Washington, Sept. 27. Major Gen
eral Funston's officail version of the
fighting between American soldiers
and Carranzistas at El Valle, Friday,
blames the American soldiers, of
whom one was killed and another
slightly injured, for the trouble. Fun
ston's report reached the war depart
ment today.
A report on the fight between
American and Mexican soldiers in a
saloon in El Valle, near the American
expeditionary base, last Friday, was
made to the war department today by
Brigadier General Pershing with the
comment that the Carranza officials
regarded het incident merely a drunk
en brawl. He did not give the name
of the American trooper who was
killed. The dispatch follows:
"Several soldiers from El Valle
camp ran guard Friday night, went
into El Valle, got drunk and engaged
in
row witn carranza soldiers. One
-arranza officer killed; one Carranza
soldier wounded.
"One American soldier was killed
and another slightly wounded. Board
of officers has been investigating; un
able so far to ascertain names of any
other of the party. Matter looked
upon by Carranza officials as simply
drunken row."

ADO 100,000 STRIKERS A DAY
Union Chiefs Expect to Add
Daily to Strikers.
Apathy Conspicuous; Long
shoremen Won't Quit Now.
New York, Sept. 27. Union work
ers to the number of 125, 60j went on
strike today in sympathy with the
striking traction employes, according
to figures given out at a meeting of
representatives of labor unions. There
was little evidence that a strike was
in progress.
These were the figures reported to
the meeting by the union delegates,
according to Ernest Bohm, state or
ganizer of the American Federation of
Labor. The trades which has re
sponded to the strike call, he said, are
the United Garment Workers, six
building trades unions, the paper
hangers unions, painters, house
wreckers and a number of small or
ganizations. Bohm declared that 263,-
0 00 more would go out tomorrow.
Jewish Holidays at Hand.
New York, Sept. 27. This is the
day set by union labor chiefs for a
general suspension of work in all
branches of trade in New York and
Westchester county to aid the strik
ing car employes. At one time it was
predicted that upwards of 760,000
trade unionists would stop work, but
today the leaders estimated that about
200,000 men and women would re
spond to their call.
Attempts to estimate the number of
strikers were complicated by the fact
that thousands of Jewish workers will
remain idle over Thursday and Friday
in celebration of the beginning of the
Jewish New Year. Of the 200,000
expected by the leaders to strike, 140
000 are members affiliated with the
United Hebrew trades who stop work
each year at this time for the Jewish
holidays.
Those Who Voted to Strike,
Among the organizations which
have voted to strike today,, according
lo uiosb greeting tne movement are;
Ladies garment workers, 95,000; !
clothing workers, 40,000; painters and
decorators, 15,000; furriers, 15,000;
tinsmiths, 10,000; butchers, 10,000;
stationary firemen, 2,500; paper box
makers, 7,000; milliners, 6,000; jewelry
workers, 3,000; brewery workers,
6,000. Total, 209,500.
The leaders asserted that in addi
tion to those to quit work today they
would be able to call out 100,000 more
daily for the next two or three days.
At the last moment it became
known that T. V. O'Connor, national
president of the longshoremen's union,
had decided not to call out the 45,000
members of that organization today.
Harbor Unions Postpone Walkout.
Many of the unions have deferred
action until tomorrow or the first of
next week, while officials of a few
locals were declaring definitely for the
sympathetic strike.
the longshoremen who were ex
pected to give the greatest support to
tne siriKing carmen, nave decided not
to strike just now. The tidewater
boatmen, the coopers and the steam
winch engineers also postponed action.
so. the harbor is not tied up.
President O Connor of the long
shoremen's union, who less than a
week ago declared: "You can bet
your life there'll be a sympathetic
strike," left for "Washington, stating
that he had not ordered a strike for
today and refusing to comment
further.
Mayor and Governor Sit Back
Mayor Mitchel and Governor Whit
man are not taking ai.y definite action
today regarding the strike, so far as is
known. The mayor called into con
ference Hugh Frayne, organizer of the
A. F. of L., and asked him what he
expected to have happen. Frayne re-
plied that they expected 200,000 men
to go out as a starter.
REBELS HOLD DURANG0
Reported General Gomez, Carranza
Leader, Was Expected.
El Paso. Texas, Sept. 27. Mexican
rebels announcing themselves as "Leg
alists" are in possession of the im
portant town of Durango, capital of
the state of that name since Friday,
according to reports recieved at
Juarez todav.
Two former Vilr.sta leaders led
about a thousand men in the attack

bered about 1,500, commanded by
Genera Gobez, who was captured and
executed, according to the reports.
Carranza military officials at Juarez
issued a denial that Durango had been
captured by rebels.

BACK TO MEXICO
Ambassador to U. S. Suddenly
Summoned by Carranza.
First Chief Is Displeased With
Conference Delay.
Washington, Sept. 27. Eliseo Ar
redondo, the Mexican ambassador
designate now on his way to Mexico
City, is expected by personal confer
ences to give General Carranza a.
clearer understanding of the Ameri
can v.ew of difficulties between the
two countries and state department
officials hope he may be able to con
vince the first chief of the necessity
of consenting to full consideration of
all issues by the joint commission.
Mr. Arredondo left Washington yes
terday afternoon after calling on Sec
retary Lansing. Counselor Polk iii
Assistant Secretary Phillips, , ex
plained to these officials that'General
Carranza had requested, his presence
in Mexico City.
Secretary Lansing said he had no
direct knowledge of the purpose of
Mr. Arredondo's trip, but indicated
that he expected him back in Washi
ngton within two or tnree weeks, rne
ambassador's wife and children have
remained in Washington. General
Carranza has shown plainly, recently.
that he is not in accord with the Amer
ican idea of the work undertaken by
the Mexican-American commission at
New London. Officials here have been
puzzled by his notice to governors of
Mexican states that the commission
ers would discuss nothing beyond the
withdrawal of American troops from
Mexico.
Mexican Commissioners Surprised.
New London. Sept. 27. The Mexi
can representation on the joint com
mission that is seeking a basis for an
agreement between this country and
Mexico ana Doraer control, pruiesseu
surprise today that the departure of
Ambassador-Designate Arreaonao xor
Mexico was attributed in some quar
ters to failure of tne commissioners
to agree. According to their informa
tion Mr. Arredondo's visit to Mexico
will be brief and it is not due to the
conference of the commisisoners.
When the commissioners met today
the consideration of the difierent
plans suggested for a better control
of the border was continued.
RELEASE TWO BRITONS
Army Officers, Held at EUis Island
Pending Investigation.
Washington, Sept. 27. Release of
Major Arthur S. Humphries and Lieut.
Hugh Levick, jr., the British army of
ficers detained at Ellis Island on their
arrival from England, was ordered to
day by Commissioner General cami
netti of the immigration bureau.
Evidence taken yesterday by a spe
cial board of inquiry showed that
Humphries is en route to Canada on
leave, while Levick is on his way to
Boston to visit relatives ana Dotn are
traveling entirely as individuals.
Mr. Cammettl expiainea mat tne
flfttention of the officers was only a
neutrality precautionary step and that
there was no intention on the part of
the government to interfere with tne
movements of European officers or
men coming to America as individuals
and not engaged in active service as
members of a beu.gerent armeu
force.
Secretary Lan3ing said the only re
striction imposed by the state depart
ment upon passage of British soldiers
thru the United States to Canada ap
plied to a proposed movement about
a year ago of a large number of sol
diers. The department objected and
the troops were diverted direct thru
Canada.

on
G.
O. P. Standard Bearer Badly
in Need of Rest,
Akron. Ohio. Sept. 27. Nominee
Hughes finished his tour of Ohio to
day, sore of throat and tired of body.
He was yanked out of his bed shortly
after 7 o'clock to make a rear end of
tho train speech here. He was due for
a more extended address at Canton
and then rest until noon, when he was
due to arrive at Pittsburg.
With his stops here and at Canton,
concluding his Ohio stumping ex
perience, it was estimated today that
the Republican nominee has been seen
by about 75,000 Ohioans and has
spoken to probably 50,000. Despite
the fact that he was almost tired out
and his voice nearly gone from his
three days' tour in Indiana, the candi
date "pulled" more new speeches and
touched on more subjects in the Buck
eye state than he has in any previous
three days of campaigning. For the
most part his critical analysis of the
Democratic administration was direct
ed at the Adamson eight-hour bill and
the Mexican policy but he embel
lished his attacks with a newer line of
logic than he has developed in some
tiir;e.
First Speech in Pennsylvania.
This afternoon Hughes was to make
his first speech in Pennsylvania since
becoming a presidential candidate. He
was due to speak at least twice in
the Smoky City. Leaving the Key
stone state tonight after this one brief
appearance, Hughes was due tomor
row at Trenton and Jersey City for
brief addresses, swinging northward
into New York state on the day fol
lowing.
Hughes will have at least a week's
rest in iSiew lork City after he re
turns from his present trip oiv Octo
ber 1. Complete relaxation will be
necessary if the candidate is to finish
his stumping tour. It may be that he
will go down on Long Island in order
to obtain complete seclusion.
Mrs. Hughes is concerned over her
husband's ability to withstand many
more of the sort of campaign trips he
is now finishing particularly now
that his throat may go back on him.
Moreover, the governor, in his mo
ments of relaxation today, looked tired
out. Once on a platform with several
thousand cheering people in front of
him, he is able to throw off that
weariness and appear revived and full
of energy.

Furney imagined he was a grenadier

the "grenade" at an "enemy" trench
several yard3 away another row of
cotton.
- Furney' s 13 year old sister. Fay, rose
in the "trench" just as he threw. He
cried out at her but she only turned

Quick Victories Hasten Cleanup
on Western Front.
Caught in Corner, Germans Die
Operating Guns.
London, Sept. 27. The most suc
cessful blow struck by Anglo-French
troops since the battle of the Marne
brought the capture of Peronne and
Bapaume appreciably nearer. It is
possible, English military critics said
today, that both these towns, the im
mediate objectives of the great allied
offensive, will fall within a fortnight.
The apparent ease with which German
resistance collapsed at Thiepval yes
terday, following the capture of
Combles,. surprised military observers
here and led them to predict quick
victory for the British and French in
the drives on Perrone and Bapaume.
A large number of German prison
ers has been brought in all along the
Somme front as the result of yester
day's successful operations. At Com

lighting Fiercest of Whole War.
The final dash against Combles de-
veloped into some of the most savage
fighting of the whole war. The Ger
mans caught in the southwestern
angle of the village stuck to their ma
chine guns bravely and died at their
posts. The French, advancing thru
the cemetery on the northeast, were
repeatedly counter-attacked by Teu
ton detachments that stormed their
lines in the face of certain death.
A few Germans -who escaped, re
treated hastily toward Sailly, falling
back, a distance of more than two
miles. - - r" - -- ' -
Details of the capture of Thiepval
are still lacking. The Thiepval posi
tion, fortified perhaps more strongly
than any village on the Somme line,
had held up the advance of the British
left wing since the opening day of the
allied offensive. It tumbled in under
one sudden smash that sent the Ger
mans rolling back upon Grandiecourt.

night of July 15, when his wife waa
murdered ?"
This is the all-important question,
the solution of which was indicateU

cient importance to determine Mc
uaniel s guilt or innocence.
Detectives hired by the state inti

Judge Charges Grand Jury.
Judge Thomas F. Ryan of the crim
inal eourt today charged the special
grand jury called to investigate the
death of Mrs. Oscar D. McDaniel. wife
of the prosecuting attorney of Buch
m;n.couDt;v who was found by her
husband in a dying condition in her
bed on the night of July 16.
Judge Ryan's charge was brief, but
pointed. He told the grand jurors
that a foul murder had been com
mitted in this community and that
they should spare neither time nor ex
pense in their efforts to ascertain who
committed it, that the guilty person
might he punished. He admonished
the jurors to pay no attention to
rumors or clamor, and to avoid being
influenced.
"It is not incumbent upon the grand
jury to indict," he said, "and the body
should proceed with its work with
great caution."
Preliminary Trial This Afternoon.
St. Joseph, Mo., Sept. 27. Two legal
bodies were summoned here today tw
begin consideration of the case of
Oscar D. McDaniel, prosecuting attor
ney of Buchanan county, who in
charged with the murder of his wife.
Indications were that the first of nu
merous legal skirmishes expected to
mark the progress of the case with
startling developments would take
place over the prisoner's announced
intention of making every effort to
obtain his release on bond. Prelim
inary hearing of the state warrant on
which McDaniel i held was set for
i injs anernuon.
j Bart M. Lockwood, special prose
I cutor announced that at this hearing1
he would ask that the prisoner be
certified to the grand jury, which
would operate to deny him bail until
the grand jury had concluded the
deliberations. The grand jury wef ,
called to convene this morning, with
prospects that the numerous witnesses
subpoenaed by the state would re
quire at least a week to be heard.
Find Another Weapon.
Meanwhile investigation of the mur
der in the McDaniel home on the
night of July 15 is centered on the
effort to find the weapon with which
Mrs. McDaniel was clubbed to death.
Counsel for the accused husband
today said they attached much impor
tance to the finding of a heavy mallet,
known as a bung starter, in a trash
pile on a vacant lot near the McDaniel
residence. The prosecuting attorney
has said he believed the murder was
committed by burglars or other law
less persons in revenge for his activ
ities against them.
WILL NOT INVESTIGATE
Matters Drop When Two Fatherless
Babes Die In Topeka.
No investigation is planned of th
death of two fatherless babes Sunday
at Crittenton home. The cause of th
deaths was ptomaine poisoning, the
result of drinking condensed milk.
Three babes were bottle fed and within
two hours after drinking the milk
Sunday morning, two had died and
the third was violently ill.
Mrs. Emma Burke, superintendent
of the home, emphatically denied this
morning the statement that th
milk was taken fresh from a can Sun
day morning. She declared that it
was condensed milk purchased from f.
drug store.
"I know nothing of an investiga
tion," said Mrs. Burke. "That lies in
the hands of the board of directors."
The president of the board of di
rectors stated that any steps of that
nature would be taken by the doctors
Dr. L,. B. Bushong, the attending phy
sician, said that no investigation will
be made.
"I understood that the milk was
thrown away," said Dr. Bushong.
The two babes who died were two
months old, according to the death re
port filed with the city clerk. The
third was six months old and was
i saved by the use of a stomach pump.
