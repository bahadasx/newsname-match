By a Staff Correspondent.
Mott, July 28.—On schedule time,
the Northern Pacific special carrying
over one hundred boosters from Bis­
marck and towns enroute, rolled into
Mott, and the junketeers immediately
piled out and proceeded to give the
lively little town in Hettinger county
the "once over."
The trade extension tourists were
given a rousing reception by throngs
of prominent business men, ladleB and
children, who were on hand to dem­
onstrate their hospitality and to
show the Capitay City folks and their
/friends picked up on the journey the
important sights and places of inter­
est in and about Mott.
The crack musicians, who enter­
tained the excursionists with rousing
marches and ''ditties" while enroute
from Bismarck to Mott, were in their
glory and demonstrated their ability
to provide music par-excellence by
playing several stirring marches and
leading the procession from the de
ipot through the main street.
Practically every man, woman and
child was on hand at "The Spot" dia­
mond to witness the snappy exhibi­
tion of baseball staged Ibetween Bis­
marck and Mott and immediately
after the ball game the tourists were
taken around to renew acquaintances,
make more friends, and given to un­
derstand that Mott was in their hands
for the occasion. The keys "of the
city were turned over to the invaders
and to .sajf th$t eyeryojie enjoyed- the

Would be putting it mildly.
After a pleasant visit, warning
whistles from the special announced
that It was time for the return jour­
ney. Goodbyes were in order and the
junketers pulled out with a feeling
that' they had had the time of their
liveig: .enjoyed themselves to the full
left behind them many good friends
and, a general feeling of good fellow­
ship.
8EVENTY-FIVE BOOSTERS
MAKE START TO MOTT
En P.oute, Bismarck to Mott, July
Si.—Seventy-five good Bismarck citi­
zens this morning oibeyed the Com­
mercial club's injunction to "Make
Mott the Spo* for You," and shortly
after 7 o'clock, steamed out of t*e
Capital City for the second big "get
acquainted tour" of the season.
The Bismarck Booster Band, es­
pecially organized for this tour, fav­
ored Bismarck with an early morn­
ing cdncert, which left no question as
to the' quality of music which was to
be provided ttr the day. Manager
Kirk and his pill-busters showed up
early the dinner was iplaced in com­
mission., at 7 sharp, and everybody
was...happy when Conductor Hayes
fravje the high sign.
A atop of fifteen minutes was made
at Mandan, where several rousing
inarches were played, A number of
Morton county seat folk joined the
tour at this point. At Fort Rice sev­
eral business men came aboard and
there' were further substantial in­
creases at Solen and Timmer. It is
Probable that at least 150 people will
le with the sociability tourists when
they reach the terminus.
Officials Aboard.
C. A. Mathews, assistant general
passenger agent, from St. Paul, and

out of Mandan, are doing the honors
for the Northern Pacific. Business
car No. is really a commodious
observation car, with a half-dozen
state-rooms and comfortalble accomo­
dations for twenty or thirty guests.
Lemonade has been on tap through
cut the morning, and there has been
an abundance of takers.
While crop 'tals has been tabooed
on the junket, there is no reason to
believe that any of the country
through which, the .train sped this
morning is going to the demnition
bow-wows. It is rather dry in spots
ibut the farmers expect fair crops,
•nd are prepared to get into the
fields next week. No hall damage
has been reported at any point to
date.
Band A Great Success.
The most Important figure on the
trip is Master Archie McPhee, the
diminutive drum' major who leads the
booster band. Master Archie has his
organization well in hand, and when
he marches down' the street in his
chic. uniform of white and blue, beat­
ing time with his Bismarck baton,
he never fails to get a hand.

Millions of people throughout the
world are speculating on the Deutsch
land's chances of evading the allies'
blockade
These, are the obstacles in the
Deutschiand's path and against her
chances for a safe return to German
waters.
The Deutschland, to leave Chesa­
peake 'bay, must traverse an extraor­
dinarily narrow channel. When the
dash is made for .the open sea, with
periscope submerged, as it may have
to be, the undersea craft must have
at least 35 feet of water in which to
travel without being observed from
the surface.
There is only one channel out of
'Chesapeake bay that has that depth
and this channel is only one and
three-quarter miles wide It is at the
southern entrance to the bay, direct­
ly off Ca/pe Henry.
Just outside the channel is the
three-mile limit where allied war­
ships, destroyers and motor patrols
are reported waiting to pounce upon
and destroy the German merchant­
man.
rine calmly states he has no fear of
warships. He could avoid 50 of them
he says.
Franklin D. Roosevelt, assistant
secretary of the United States navy,
has stated it would (be impossible to
place submarine nets outside the
three-mile limit. But the British and
French have accomplished the impos­
sible, according to authoritative
sources. Roosevelt held that it would
be impossible to "plant" nets outside
the three-mile limit, and even if it
were, the cost of the nets would be
prohi'bitiye.
Should the Deutschland succeed in
evading the enemy off Cape Henry
and Cape Charles, she will still have
ahead of her a journey filled with
danger.
If she attempts to return through
the English channel she will have to
escape a maze of nets and mines and
many amored motorboats.
If she skirts the British Isles to
the north she will have to go hun­

Besides these foreign dangers there
are the ever-present menaces of in­

The entire world will watch the
Deutschiand's progress.
HEAT RECORD
STABUSHED
Thermometer Reaches 96 1-2
Local People Suffer, But No
7 Prostrations Reported.
"NO RELIEF" PREDICTION
FOR REST OF MONTH
Records at the local weather ob­
servatory received a jolt yesterday,
when the thermometer jumped to
96 1-2 degrees and remained there the
greater part of the day. Yesterday
was the hottest day experienced in
the Capital City thus far this year
and it is the hottest July day on rec­
ord since July 1.6, 1910, when a tem­
perature of 107 degrees was regis­
tered.
Reports from the weather man last
evening indicated that no relief may
be expected from the intense heat for
the remainder of this month. Should
this prediction be true all tempera­
ture records for July will bo broken.
The mean maximum temperature for
this month to date is 88 degrees and
the mean minimum temperature for
that length of time 64 degrees, making
a mean monthly temperature of 76
degrees, which is higher than any
preceding July in the history of the
station.
The lowest temperature recorded
this month was 60 degrees, on July 24.
No prostrations in Eismarck or vi­
cinity have been reported thus far,
but farmers and others whose work
requires them to work in the broiling
sun report, that many horses and oth­
er animals have been overcome by
the intense heat.
The Agricultural college specialists
have diagnosed the rust which is so
prevalent in this and other sections of
the state as a species of "black rust."
The continued humid high tempera­
ture that has prevailed during the
month is just what is required for
the spread of this plant disease and
the danger of crop shrinkage increas­
es daily as the heat continues at such
high temperature.
Although many persons claim that
the heat of yesterday did not seem
as bad as the heat of the day be­
fore,. .the. slight. wind that prevailed
was no doubt the cause for relief on
occasions.

In response to a telephone message,
Sheriff McDaniels led a pursuit, which
surrounded and captured the robbers
about two miles from Sunol. 'Approx­
imately $1200, found in their posses­
sion, was recovered.
ELVLASBTH RATCLIEPEr
Seventeen-year-old victim of the air murder, A case without paral­

HOW AIR DEATH OCCURS
By Dr. R. H. Bishop.
Air bubbles act on the heart
like a piece of waste on an auto­
mobile carburetor.
Once introduced into a large
blood vein an air bubble is car­
ried along by the blood stream
and within three or four second*
reaches the cornonary vessels
which are to the heart what the
carburetor is to the automobile.
The moment the air bubble
reaches these vessels it blocks or
cuts off the blood supply which
keeps the heart pumping, just
like a piece of waste would cut
off the supply of gasoline to the
carburetor.
The heart, which is the carburv
etor of the human machine, lack­
ing fuel, "misses fire" and the
human engine stops. Death is in­
stantaneous and painless.

StiKIp
er lived a more sensational crime
than that charged against Roy Hinter
liter of "Hell Texas"—the murder of
his 17-year-old sweetheart, Elizabeth
Ratcliffe.
Air blown into a catheter by some­
one's breath and pumped into the
girl's blood, caused her death—a nev
er-before-heard-of murder, absolutely
without parallel in all criminal and
medical history.
Examination of the girl's bod)
showed an artery had been opened
with a hypodermic neeclle, a catheter
inserted in the incision and air pump­
ed into the veins. The inrushing air
caused an air bubble to reach the
girl's heart. Death resulted instantly.
The theory of the state authorities
in holding Hinterliter is that he did
not know what killed the girl and
was as puzzled at the cause of the
death as the doctors. It is not inti­
mated by the prosecution that the
youth had any inenion of killing
girl.
The murder of the girl, a farmer's
