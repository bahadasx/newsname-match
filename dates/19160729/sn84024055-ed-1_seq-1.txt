In spite of the manly efforts on the
part of Col. Franklin A. Denison, Com
manding the Eighth Regiment Illinois
National Guards and its line oflicers
to prevent its members from getting
into trouble while stationed at Camp
Wilson, Fort Sam Houston, San Anto
nio, Texas, and thereby causing ever
lasting or burning disgrace to fall upon
tin heads of all of its members; it ap
pears that last Monday was pay day
at Ihe Fort and on that same evening
Sergt. Walter M. Blue, 3527 South
State street, this city; Private Edward
liightborne, 31514 Rhodes ave.; Private
S. R. AVilliams, 3514 Rhodes ave., all
of Co. E and several other members
of the Eighth Regiment entered a
saloon in San Antonio which was filled
with White men including many White
M)Miers and some how or other a saloon
row was started.
The newspaper account of the saloon
fijjht and shooting follows: "Three
grocs of the Eighth Infantry were
s-liot during the barroom battle Mon
dav evening by the provost guard of
fit Nineteenth Regulars, the injured
are:
Sergt. Walter M. Blue, 3527 Stato
Mreet, shot through the loins.
l'rivate Edward Lightborne, 3514
lfliodes avenue, shot through thigh.
l'rivate S. R. Williams, 3514 Rhodes
Henue. leg shattered below the knee;
imputation necessary.
"It is probable that other men of
t'e Eighth were wounded by the fire
of the provost guard, but managed to
'ape. Blue, Lightborne, and Wil
liams aro in tho baso hospital. All of
the men are of E company.
Gen. Ilill. commanding the Second
'riyade, said that he had no report of
tl( fracas, am the account of tho
Vneteenth regiment docs no credit to
thi Negroes. Herbert S. llenne, an
attorney of New Braunfels, was a
I'rnuMjinl in the quarrel.
Negroes Curse Motorist.
"I drove my car around tho corner
just as one of the Negroes was step
ping from the curb," Mr. Henne said.
"I didn't touch him, in fact nearly
wrecked my car swinging out of his
way. There were ten or twelve men
in the party and they started to curse
me. One of them threw a brick into
my car. I had stopped the machine
and they were evidently going to pull
me out.
"I ran into the saloon at New
Braunfels road and Wilson street and
asked the bartender for a revolver.
The Negroes ran in after me and the
bartender hid. The provost guard ran
in to investigate the commotion and
when the Negroes showed fight, opened
fire. Three of the Negroes fell. I
think several others were hit, but es
caped." Albert Fellows of the provost guard
declared that it was necessary to fire
to prevent the Eighth men from mak
ing an attack.
"They started to throw beer bottles
when wo ordered them to surrender,
and as we were outnumbered 5 to 1
wo had to shoot in self-defense."
Negroes Tell Story.
The wounded soldiers were not ac
cessible at the base hospital, but Capt.
Clinton L. Hill of Company E told
their story as they gave it to him.
"I sent Sergt. Blue and several men
downtown to change some $20 gold
pieces. It was pay day for the Eighth.
Blue says they entered the saloon to
get the change, and didn't try to buy
a drink.
"'Get out of here!' was yelled at
them from all parts of the barroom.
Blue tried to get Williams and Light
borne out after some words with sev
eral White soldiers. As they reached
the sidewalk a brick was thrown, and
then the provost guard arrived.
General Funston in his report of the
affair to the War Department, Wash
ington, D. C, put the greater part of
the blame on the Colored soldiers; for
investigation has exonerated the guard
from firing on the soldiers and a trial
bv court martial of some of the sol
diers of the Eighth regiment has been
ordered.
Gen. Funston s report follows:
It was a budding "Brownsville inci
dent" in which the Colored soldiers
of the Eighth Illinois regiment appear
to have been aggressors, that was
nipped at Fort Sam Houston yesterday,
official report on the affair from Gen.
Funston indicated. The telegram fol
lows: "After having been paid, about
forty men of Eighth Illinois (Colored)
were assembled in a saloon near the
reservation. Threats were made to
throw out the White soldiers, and it
is believed that some disturbance oc
curred. Report came to guardhouse to
send guards to stop disturbance.
Patrol of four or five men went to
scene and tried to disperse crowd, but
without much success. Patrol was
joined by about four more members of
guard and all tried to get men away
by pushing them along.
"Guard finally had to strike some
men with butt of guns. Then mem
bers of Eighth Illinois began to throw
rocks at guard. Guard finally fired
several guard cartridges at legs of
crowd. Wounded three members of
Eighth Illinois in legs, though none
seriously. Crowd then dispersed.
Tho Eighth Regiment National
Guards have only been absent from
Chicago about six weeks and it is the
second time that some of its members
for some cause or other have gotten
into trouble, being unwilling to obey
orders is the main cause, why they get
into all kinds of trouble, if soldiers
must have their whiskey whenever pay
day rolls around then some one con
nected with each regiment or company
should be empowered to buy several
barrels of whiske, haul it onto the
grounds where the soldiers arc sta
tioned and then let the men drink and
fight among themselves in their tents
and within the confines of their camps.
Col. Jack Johnson and his White
wife have at last it appears hit tho
very hard rocks at Madrid, Spain, and
Mrs. Johnson has been forced to soak
her diamonds in order for them to
brush by.
Some months ago Johnson turned up
in Spain with his wife, an English box
ing trainer, and a Negro boxer and
took a suite of rooms at a palatial ho
tel. He attempted to book passage for"
Brazil, but learned that he was not per
mitted to leave Spain without a pass
port. The American Embassy refused
to issue a passport, under instructions
from Washington, because Johnson fled
from Chicago during his prosecution
for white slavery.
Johnson went to Barcelona and
staged a prize fight between himself
and another Negro. Tho $1,000 John
son earned soon ran out and he is try
ing to coax the promoters to stage an
other affair. Ho told friends that un
less he can start a boxing school here
he will have hard sledding.
Jack Johnson would give the whole
world if he only could return to Chi
cago and race at break-neck speed in
his auto up and down old State street
