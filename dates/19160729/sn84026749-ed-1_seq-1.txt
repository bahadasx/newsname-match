Authorities Mystified by Appear
ance of Saurians Didn't
Come From Zoo.
There are no sharks In the District,
It Is true, but up to a week ago there
were live and uncivilized alligators dls
porting themselves In nock Creek near
the Zoo.
Thuy had not escaped from the alliga
tor pond at the Zoo, In fact the authori
ties are In the dark as to how they ot
in the creek. It might have rained alli
gators, or maybe some person who had
them as pets let them stray down the
street In an unguarded moment. Any
way, they appeared suddenly near tne
Zoo.
It was a most astonished keeper who
looked on the bank of the creek one
morning a few days ago, and saw air.
Alligator stretched out sunning hlmtelt.
The keeper look another look, ruubed
his eyes a couple of times, pinched him
self, and then really believed that it
was a sure-'nough 'gator.
The next thing to do was to catch iho
animal. But It got away that time.
The next morning he looked and there
It was again. This time assistance w.is
hurriedly called, and a regular posse
went after the alligator. It slid oft into
deep water, but was rounded up by the
men who had pursued it into the creek.
They, captured it, and It Is now among
the alligator colectlon In the Hon house
of thftZoo.
It was a large 'gator, too. Superin
tendent Baker said that "It was blc
enough to take a nice piece out of one'
eg, it one was wading in tne creek."
It was about four feet long, of a very
wjgglesome disposition, and by last ro
ports Is doing well.
But that by no means finished the
'gator shower. The mornlnir after its
capture, another was seen, punning itself
ut about the same spot on, thai creea
bank. The posse was afajqiorganlxed,
and hunted down the second arrival. It
slipped to deep water, and was missed
for a day or so. but soon It was seen.
and a large number of men went Into
the creek after It.
One managed to catch It by the tail,
but it had to be shot before It could be
captured. This ends the alligator shower
at tho Zoo. The authorities there re
quest any Wsshlngtonlans who have
pet alligators please to Inform them be
fore they turn the beast loose in tho
park.

WORKS' DEFEAT SEEN, TOO
Friends of Half-and-Half Expect
Marshall's Ruling to Be
Overruled.
Senate supporters, of prohibition
in the District have lost hope of
getting anywhere with the pro
posed' legislation in connection
with the District bill.
Though anxious to press the mat
ter in view of Vice President Mar
shall's ruling that the Works
amendment to abolish the District
government was in order, they be
came satisfied today that they prob
ably could accomplish nothing.
In the first place, they were ad
vised the Senate probably would
overturn the ruling of the Vice
President on an appeal. They
were doubtful, in the second place,
whether the votes could be had to
pass a "dry" amendment.

Consideration of the District bill was'
held back this morning by a discussion
of the nogcr Casement resolution.
The bill wns reached early In the af
ternoon. Amendment Still Pending.
The Works amendment Involving the
half-and-half lssuo and providing for
the abolition of tho District govern
ment, was still before the Senate when
that body resumed consideration of the
District appropriation bill today.
A complicated parliamentary tangle
arose from tho ruling pt the Vice Presi
dent yesterday that the Works amend
ment was in order.
There being a question whether the
appeal of Senator Blair Lee from tha
decision of the chair was In order, Sen
ator Leo said ho would withdraw the
appeal and bring the matter up when
the hill passed from tho committee of
the whole to tho Senate proper.
That tho Works amendment to abol
ish tho District government and hare
the National Government take charge
of the City of Washington, paying all
costs, taxes on residents to remain
as now, would fall, waa regarded as
u certainty.
The sentiment for the preservation
of tho half-and-half idea until some
thing better could be found is strong
among Senators.
Thty 1 not like the House Idea of
abandoning' the half-and-half without
substituting a dvtlnlto policy for it.
What will be done when the bill
reaahes conference Is uncertain. If
tho House should stand out firmly for
the abolition of the hiflf-and-Ualf 'and
the Senat maintain Its position for
lt. then anieadlock may result which
will end In simply continuing the
present District appropriation act for
this fiscal year.
Other Problems in Bill.
Not only tho half-and-half but the
Municipal Hospital and several other
problems remained to be threshed out
v,h(.n the bill was taken up.
The opposition to putting the Munici
pal Hospital at Fourteenth and Upshur
