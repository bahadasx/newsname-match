IT IS A PLEASURE
What is the cause? The way in 'which our
wheat is yielding, quantity, quality and color.
Now is the time to make the best of what
we have as it looks as if the productiveness of the
year is reached.
Now is a good time to watch the result and
see if the profit is what it should be.
, What better way can you find of keeping
account than by using a checking account.
We can help you.

The ice cream parlors- and soft
dTinfc emporiums are quite popular
places but the court house park Is
the one locality that catches the
crowd these hot days-and warm, dry
evenings. - Fully one hundred per
sons were-resting, reading and visit
ing there, at one time- last Sunday
afternoon. Tes, the park is a beauty spot and -the
more shame it Is that visitors
allow it to become litered.up with
lunch boxes, tobacco tins and waste
paper. Also it would seem needless
that a pair of ladiea.
