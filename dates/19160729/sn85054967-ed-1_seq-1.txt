VOLUME 111 No. 31
Seven Hundred Millions For
Defense Provided By Senate
Army Bill Passed with Few Changes from
Committee Recommendations Carrier
$311,000,000, Increase over House
Washington, July 27 Nearly seven hundred millions
for defense in the fisGal year of 1917 is the aggregate of pro
posed appropriations reached in the Senate today with pass
age of the army appropriation bill carrying, in round num
bers $314,000,000.
This grand total for preparedness still is subject to re
vision, however, because the army bill will follow the naval
bill into conference, where reductions are probable, despite
the firm attitude of President Wilson in supporting the lib
eral response of the Senate to the call for adequate defense.
Appropriations for preparedness as they now stand are :
Army, $313,970,447.10; Navy, $315,826,843.55; Fortifica
tions (passed by both branches), 825,748,050; The Military
school, §2,238,328. 57 ; Army and Navy deficiency, $27,559,-
348.05; Total, $685,343,017.27.
Hog Cholera in North
Part of This County
Entire Herd of D. H. Wyant
Js Wiped Out by Disease.
Hog cholera has made its ap
pearance in Indiana county and
as a reseult of its ravages David
H. Wyant, of Covode, has lost
20 valuable swine.
The disease had its appear
ance in the select herd of swine
owned by Mr. Wyant about a
week ago. Within two days the
herd had been pratically wiped
out. The State authorities were
notified and an agent of the
State Livestock Sanitary Board
was immediatly sent to Covode.
Two of the hogs were still liv
ing and these were inoeulated
at once with the cholera ser
um. The disease had advanced
too far in one of them and it
died shortly after inoculation.
The other animal is recovering.
A quarantine has been estab
lished and inasmuch as the dis
ease has not made its appear
ance elsewhere it is not believed
that the disease will spread.
Mr. Wyant recently lost 100
chickens through an epidemic
of gaps. —Punxy- Spirit.

BERNE, July 27.—The gen

issued the following order to
the French, English, German
and Austria-Hungarian war
prisoners who have been sent to
Switzerland for recuperation:
"The soldiers of the different
belligerent nations on Swiss soil
have to salute the commissioned

GENERAL BLISS.

[The Sixty-ninth New York, the "fighting
Irishmen," got under way' for the Texas
border, but under circumstances that
caused a veritable explosion in Camp
Whitman. At the very moment of en
tralnment a telephone message was re
ceived from Major General Wood at
Governors Island relieving Colonel Lew
is D. Conley and Lieutenant Colonel
John D. Phelan of their commands. The
only explanation vouchsafed was that
these officers were laboring under
"physical disabilities."
The whole camp was thunderstruck by
the news, but the men of the Sixty
ninth were more than that. They were
in despair. To flght without Colonel
Conley seemed even worse than remain
ing listlessly at Camp Whitman, and a
more than ominous murmur was heard
in the ranks. The men are closely at
tached to their officers, who have work
ed hard in the service.
With congress clamoring for informa
tion as to the treatment received by the
national guard and press dispatches
coming in from various sources relat
ing the trials to which the men are be
ing subjected en route and of the lack
of sufficient equipment, Major General
Tasker H. Bliss, assistant chief of staff (
of the army, was sent to the border to ,
make a thorough inspection of all con

of the reservoir a few hours
after his death.
Hundreds of people saw the
body and many of them asked
the employees of the Clymer

quire three days to do it and
that in case of a fire, Indiana
would be without water. Fol
lowing this statement hundreds
called up W. C. Chapman, Sec
retary of the Board of Health,
and asked what if anything he
could do. Several stories were
told, but finally the Water Co.,
to avoid annoyances ordered it
drained. It is said that over
three million gallons of water
are in the reservoir.
Employees of the Clymer

ALL WELL WATER
MUST BE BOILED
JOHNSTOWN, July 28.—'The
residents of Walnut Grove who
use water from wells in that
section yesterday afternoon re
ceived warning from the John
stown health authorities to boil
all water before using it. An
analysis of the water in the
seven wells in that vicinity
shows that in six of the wells
are bacilus cloacae.
No typhoid germs were found
in the water, but the presence
of bacilus cloacae indicates that
seepage is finding its way into
the water and that therefore
typhoid germs in the ground
could find their way into the
water as well. N
The seven wells are located
in the rear of properties at 142,
179, 161, 1144, 174 Solomon
street and two at 167 Silomon
street. One well was closed by
the health authorities some days
ago.

sincere sorrow at the death of
James Whitcomb Riley.
"With his departure a notable
figure passes out of the nation's
life; a man who imparted joy
ful pleasure and a thoughtful
view of many things that other
men would missed. I am
sure I am speaking the feeling
of the whole country in expres
sing my own sense of loss.
