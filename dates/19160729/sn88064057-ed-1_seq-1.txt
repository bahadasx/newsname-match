A merchant in one of our '",aller
towns Imlade the stat tellent to mne
not long ato that the rca-,n ltu r.
fused to carry standard brand- of
clothiing anl hotes was that this
class of go ods cost- both the re
tailer and the con¢sumer more than
the unadvertised sort - hlecau-e of
the money o pent by manutifac turers
in advertising.
To prove his contention he ex
.hibited a suit. of the nonll-tanlldard
variety, containing his private
brand, with this .argument:
"This suit was made by one of
ihe best known manufacturers of
staudard clothes in this country.
It retails under the established
trademark for $25, the same price
I ask for it. I buy these clothe<,
without the makers' name in them,
for S15.u0 per suit, whereas if I
demand the makers' name I must
pay 518.50. In other words, I
inust either 10ose $3.5 ) rofit on
each sale, which amount goes into
a fund to pay for the makers' ad
vertising, or else raise the price to
the consumer."
Investigation on nmy part dctel

•ers in question refuse to place their
name and trademark on a suit un

state and federal courts, the secretary
of the interior and the commissioners
of the United States Land office at
laton Rouge and the general land of
fli-e in Washington, the litigation ex
tending over a period of six years.
As the result, J. B. Slattery was
granted a patent to lands worth at
Ies t $40.0l0. He contested the claim

largely in its own dialect, and the

peculiarly sensitive to the advance of!
age and evaded inquiries as to the
date of his birth, but the most accur
