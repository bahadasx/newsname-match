4 SWEPT OVER
DAM TO DEATH
Branch Saves Girl as
Canoe Is Spilt in
Passaic River.
Chatham, X. J.. July 2?. Two boys
and two girls were shot over the apill
way of the dam and drowned here to-day
when their canoe upset. One. girl wa-,
rescued after she had clung for ten
minutes to a branch of an overhanglng
tree.
The drowned are Mary Powd, six?
teen years old, and her brother, Edwin,
fourteen, of Madison, N. J-; William
Duffy. sixteen, of Madison, and Eliza
beth Getz, fourteen, of Philadelphia,
Margaret Ilinch is the only member ol
the canoe party who was rescued.
With others from Madison they
started out to-day for the Old Mill, a
favorite picnie ground half way bt?
tween Summit and Chatham, where a
dam broadens the Passaic River. Ord!
narily the water is calm above the
dam, but to-day the Passaic was many
feet above its normal level.
('ate* Had Been Opened.
The floodgates of the dam had been
opened to carry off the water, and Sam?
uel Edwards, proprietor of the boat
house, had given orders that no boats
were to be rented. Somehow the pic
niekers from Madison got hold of a
canoe, however, and set out. Their com
panions watched them from the bank.
They went upstream and kept near
the shore, where the current was not
ao swift. All went well. But the water
was full of tricky little eddies that
pulled the canoe slyly this way and
that, and after a brief paddle the girls
decided they would feel safer ashore.
Coming back with the surge of the
current the car...* gradualiy increased
its distance from shore, and when the
dam was sighted was almost m mid
Btraata, The boys put forth their best
efforta at the paddles, but despite their
endeavors their craft was caught in the
glassy incline that led to where the
Passaic was pouring eight feet deep
through the spillway to the rocks below.
Girla ( ry for Help.
The girls began to scream for help
when they saw they were caught in the
grip of the current and the boys
seemed to get new .strength from the
terror in therr voices. By frantic en?
deavors they managed to veer the
canoe to the left of the floodgates.
It brought up quartering against an
abutment of the dam and the upstream
side began to careen to the pressure
of the current. Before it went under,
however, 'here was a crackling and the
boat broke in two against the abut?
ment.
The five occupants were swept along
with tha fragment? of the canoe toward
the spillway and brushed along the
fnce of the darn, which in places is over
hung by bushes and tree branches.
Miss Hi'nch succeeded in grasping a
branch that held. She kept her grip.
although the current snapped her out
to full length in a jiffy and put a tre
n-endous strain on her arms.
Boy Graapa Branch.
Edwin Dowd also managed to get a
grip on a tree branch. The others were
rolled over and over, sometimrs above
and aometimes below the surface, with
small chance of seizing anything. One
by one they were pulled into the last
oily black stretch. where the ,water
fairly hissed as it rushed smoothly
toward the fall.
Dowd was nearer the floodgates than
Miss Hinch. and she could watch him,
as well as their companons. Hhe saw
the bush to which she was holding had
been undermined by the water and was
gradually losing its grip on the earth.
There was nothing to which she could
transfer her grasp, and she did not
dare warn him of the new danger, lest
he let go in hia fright or make some
sudden movement which would tear his
support entirely away.
Men about the boathouse had seen
the plight of the canoeists and were al?
ready on the way to help them. Threa
had been swept through the floodgates
before they arrived. Joaeph Herberger

T. R. TO SPEAK
AT THE HUGHES
NOTIFICATION
Accepts Invitation of
Republican National
Committee.
TOASSAIL WILSON
MEXICAN POLICY
Colonel Also Expected to
Make Four Speeches
in Maine.
Oyster Bay, N. _T__ July 2?. Despite
the fact thnt Theodore Roosevelt con
sistently maintains thnt he is out of
1 politics, and thnt with tho exception of
a few speeches he will not be active in
the approaching campaign, he has ac
repted the invitation of the Republican
National Committee to speak nt the
notification ceremonies of Charles
Kvans Huphes at Carnegie Hail on Mon?
day night.
Hoth Roosevelt and Hughes probnhly
will make th' Mexican policy of tho
Administration the centre of their at?
tack, with particular emphnsis upon the
part the militia is playing at the bor?
der.
Colonel Roosevelt is to make four
1 speeches in Maine, it is believed, in be?
half of the Maine State ticket. Fred?
erick Hale, candidate for I'nited States
' Senator, and other Maine leaders havo
conferred with the (olonel within thfl
last few days and are said to have ob
; tained his consent.
Hughes will not speak in Maine.
1 Both parties, however, are covering thc
state thoroughly. In addition to Colo
, nel Roosevelt, the Republican Congres
sional Committee will send into the
state thirty speakers, while ihe Demo?
crats will send the same number.
Senator Albert B. Fall of New Mex?
ieo, who went over the Mexican situa?
tion with Hughes in New York on
Thursday afternoon, came to Oyster
Bay to-day and talked for several
hours with (olonel Roosevelt. It Ifl
largely on account of the frequont con
ferences which both Roosevelt an.l
Hughe. have had with the Banator from
N'ew Mexieo that lt i-t thought the key?
note of their spoeche. at Carnegie Hail
will be the Mexican policy.
As far as CbIbbbI ReeaeVBlt is con
cerned, his consignment of J. A. H.
Hopkins, Progressive state chairman of
Ne* lenejr, to the Ananias Club, ended
thf controversy. The Colonel denies
that he ever told Hopkins that Hughes
might turn out to ae "another gold
brick," nnd Ilopkins is quite sure he
did.

Then he turned to the court and said:

Break Foe's Defences
in Volhynia and
Galicia.
9,000 TEUTONS
BAGGED IN DAY
Brussiloff Continues the
Struggle for Roads
in North.
London, July 28.?The Russians
delivered three preat blows against
the Teutonic forces on the Kast front
to-day. The Czar's troops captured
the important railroad town of
Brody, on the northern Galician
border, ths chief obstacle to their
advance on Lemberg; smashed the
entire first line of the enemy west of
Lutsk, and swept the forces of von
Linsinpen from the line of the rivers
Slonevka and Buldurovka, in south?
ern Volhynia. Nine thousand Aus?
trians and Germans were made pris?
oners in the desperate fiphtinp of the
day.
Vienna offieially annoanced to-night
that the Russian offensive since tha
middle of July had pushed in the
Teuton lines on a front of fifty miles
to a depth of nine and one-half miles.
Coming; from hostile Bource9, this ad
mission Is regarded as indicative of the
great strength of the Russians in the
last two weeks and the inability of the
Austrian and German armies to stand
firm against thelr pressure on all
fronts.
The unexpectedness of the fall of
Brody has almost swept London off
its feet, and there is preat rojoicinp
throuphout the city to-nipht. Mili?
tary observers are predicting tho
capture of Lemberp within the fort
nipht, topether with the breakinp
down of the entire Teuton defence
system in Galicia.
Teuton Llnea In Perll.
Brody is situataed on the Rovno
Lemberp railroad, fifty-eipht miles
northeast of the Galician capital. As
the key to the Teuton defences alonp
the Stripa and the northern frontier,
its investment places the Austrians
in a most danperous position. The
troops of General Brussiloff now
have a clear path to their objective
Hnd in addition seriously menace the
flank of the Austro-German lines on
the south as far as the Dniester.
With the advance of the Russians
along the road to Lemberg these lines
will be compelled to withdraw from
the whole of Eastern Galicia or face
envelopment. Superior in numbers and
in artiilery and ammunition, the Rus?
sians are not expected to meet with
opposition in their drive on Lemberg,
which they cannot break down as thry
have broken down the most powerfui
reeistance in the last few weeks.
Russians Gain at Sviolusky.
To-night's communique from Berlin
admits the success of Russian attacks
northeast of Svmiusky. This is taken
to mean that General SakharofT is wag
mg a new fight for the possession of
Vladimir Volynski and ita northern
neighbor, Kovel. Thii is the first time
in over a week that there has been any
indication that the Russians are still
intent on taking Kovel now. All their
efforts had been centred on the fight
for Brody and the subsequent march
on Lemberg. Apparently it is their in?
tention to strike the enemy a double
blow by concentrating against the Vol
hynian and Galician lines at the same
time.
The fall of Lemberg from the north
comefl as a surprise. Here the Rus?
sians had baan halted for days, almost
on the out?*7irt? of the town. Finding
it impossibl-i to make a breach there,
they turned to the west and, according
to all indications, were almost pre?
pared to strike at Brody from the
south. Then came the sudden, swift,
overpowerini* blow at the lines which
had before been regarded as impreg
r.able. Evidently caught unawares, the
Teutons broke before the attacks and
the Russian* swarmed into the town.
Flerce Battle Near Baranovirhl.
Around Baranovichi fierce fighting
continues, with neither side able to
win any important success. It is evi?
dent that tne Russians are throwing
all their strength into an effort to gain
command of the roads which radiate
from this region.

SEES CHANCE
OF HOME RULE
Lloyd GeorgetoStrive
Until Irish Problem
Is Solved.
London, July 28.?Replying to a re
; quest for his views on the breakdown
| of negotiations for putting Irish Jiome
Rule into effect immediately, David
' Lloyd George to-day said:
"J don't despair about an eventual
solution of the Irish problem, in spite
of the recent failure to reach an agree?
ment between the Nationalists and the
Unionists.
"We achieved at least one thing that
had never hitherto been accomplished
We brought the represent?uiv.*s of the
[riah Nationalists and the I'lster
Unionists to the point of flhaking
hands, instead of shaking fists at each
other."
Mr. Lloyd George is still full of op?
timism regarding the Irish difticulty.
He feels that a solution can be reached,
and it is his intention to strive on until
he is successful. Questioned whether
the Nationalists were justified in re
fusing the proposed settlement, Mr.
Lloyd George said:
"Never has a better offer been made
by all the British parties together.
The only new st'.pulation inserted was
one concernlng the British, and not
the Irish Parliament. The moment the
demand was put forward by the Un?
ionists that Ireland shoiild be repre
sonted at Westminster only in pro?
portion to her population. except when
the question of the Irish settlement
was under considcration, it had to ba
conceded.
Main I'rlnclplea Remain.
"It ls true," he continued, "that the
Home Rule act Ifl on the statute book.
but only with the pledge that before
it become* operative an amending bill
is to bc pasSSli dealing ^ with the ex?
clusion of I'lster."
The Secretary said the main prin?
ciples of the settlement remain, name?
ly tho immediato creation of an Irish
ParliameOt, exclusion for the prrsent
for the part of Ireland which is un
willing to participate in the Home
Rule measure, and considcration of
the whole question of tho future of
the Irish government by an imperial
conference at the close of the war.
He added that naturally he was some
what s.idd. red by the ill success of his
atumpt to bring both the Irish partie.a
coinr.letely together.
"I hav* always been an ardent Home
Ruler during my political eareer and
still remain one," Mr. Lloyd George
said. "In my opinion, a nation which
chii and doe* produee such soldier* an
the Irish troops, who are now fighting
by the side of their fellow Briton*
from all over the empire with a valor
almost indescribable, and which g:\es
us such intellects m all branchei of
life, can and must rule itself."
Dlsagreement on Two Pointfl.
Questioned as to how the breach in
the negotiations came about, Mr. Lloyd
George said:
"There were two points on which
there was dlsagreement at the end of
tka negotiations. One dealt with the
me-ans by which the exclusion of the
six I'lster eounties was to continue or
to bo brojght to an end. This, to my
view, although I believe Mr. Redmond
differs on that point, was less a matter
of substance than of words.
"Tho Nationalists agreed it was im
posmble that the Ulster eounties should
bt coerced mto an Irish Parliament. It
was understood that when they were
willing to come in no one would aeek
to keep them out. Their exclusion for
the present would not have affected in
the slightest degTce the full powers
given to the Nationalist party of Ire?
land under the Home Rule act. The
question of their eomlng in voluntanly
afurward could have been decided
when it had been seen how Home Rule
wns working out.

By ARTHl'R S. DRAPER.
London, July 28.?General Haig's
troops to-day won two big successes
on the Somme front. The last Ger?
man strongholds in Longueval were
captured and maintained against
fierce counter thrusts, and the whole
of Delville Wood was rleared of the
enemy.
It was the Anzacs against the
Brandenburgers in the Delville
Wood, and Britain's territorial
troops won a great victory over the
Kai*vr'a picked lightors, fresh from
i their successes at Douaumont. For
j seven days and nights the battle for
| possession of this important position
fhad raged. Slowly and at terrific
cost the Germans were eompelled to
give ground. Gradually the counter
attacks by which they sought to
regain lost torritory beemme less and
less powerful.
Hritish Line FToIdfl.
The British line held. British
troops overran the southern limit..
of the wood, then seized all hut thc
northern tip. Tho Brandenburgers
fought with a desperation indicative
of the value placed upon the posi?
tion by the German eommand, and
the British prOfNM halted. But the
German rank_ had been worn thread
bare, the defenders had exhausted
themselves in their attempts to stave
off retreat. They could not with
stand the fury of the British rush
to-day. Out of the last bit of woods,
to which they had clung stubbornly
for ghastly hours, day and night,
they were swept.
Twice after their surrender of the
wood the Germans rallied to the at?
tack, but Haig's battalions stood
their ground. Kemembrance of the
battle of July 17, when, after gain
ing control of the whole wood, they
were swept out of it by the enemy's
overwhelming counter charges, stif
fened the lines into a stone wall,
against whieh the German wavea
crashed and were hurled back ahat
tered.
Gennflna Weakenlnf.
In the repulse of these attacka and
the holding of the British linea
critics here read two things: German
resistance is growing weaker each
day, while the grip of Haig's forces
is becoming firmer with each added
success.
Foureaux, Pozieres, Delville,
Longueval?the week past has seen
the German mailed fist slowly relax
its grip on all these important posi?
tions. It has seen the powerful Ger?
man second line of defence crumple
up at its most vital pointa. It haa
seen the British forces sweep on to
eommand of the heights which look
down on the highway to Bapaume,
and it has seen the opening of the
far easier drive through the Teu
tonic lines in the low level fields
which alone stand between the Brit?
ish and their objective.
Britiah "Mbbllng" Continuefl.
Meanwhile, the thunder of guns at
' points far removed from the valley
of the Somme is keeping the Ger?
mans on the alert lest they be un
prepared to meet a sudden blow at
i some unsuspected apot. S'ouchez,
', Ncuve Chapeile. the Meuse and th?
