New York, July 28-President Wilson
is to be charged with having substituted
"masterful inactivity" for "watchful
waiting" in Mexico by Charles E. Hughes
and others who are soon to take the
stump against him.
This developed today after a two hours'
conference between Chairman W. R.
Willcox, of the Republican National Com
mittee and Senator Albert E. Fall. of
New Mexico.
Senator Fall submitted to Chairman
Willcox additional evidence of the
"Shilly-Shally" policy of the Wilson ad
ministration in dealing with Mexico and
promised to take the field in Maine or
anywhere else to prove that the Presi
dent is responsible for anarchy in the
sister republic and failure to protect
American lives and property.
When Senator Fall parted from Chair
man Willcox he was asked:
Is Mr. irughes to approve your de
mand for intervention in Mexico?"
"Mr. Hughes must answer that ques
tion. I am here merely to counsel with
him and Chairman Willcox as to how
the Mexican and other issues may be
made thoroughly understood by the
voters so they can act intelligently on
election day."
