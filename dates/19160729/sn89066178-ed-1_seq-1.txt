rri HE RECOGNITION of human rights, which lies at the foundation of the American
J I Republic, has, for one hundred and twenty-eight years, made this country a refuge
for the oppressed from ail points of the compass. We nave been called the melting-U-s
pot of the nations, because here is to be found the giratest known intermingling of
L nationalities and races. This was glorious as long as we could assimilate the hordes
that accepted our hospitality but not our principles. As a result, we are. today con
fronted with the problem of dealing with those who, hating left the old world to escape
despotism, come here and, thinking tney now have the power, seek to set up in the new world
the same despotism, they left the old to escape. FranWm Suiner.

record of hostility to the larger free
dom that is the crowning glory of
liberal democracy.
When he introduced the Free
Pre Defense League demands he
asked for an investigation which
more than anything else would tend
to allay the rising tide of religious
prejudice and arrive at the truth in a
democratic way, be punned a melu
od approved by all people who be

of perplexing and conflicting elaima
he took hia stand among live greet

Mr. Lindbergh was born in
Sweden in 1859. Ilia parents
brought him to the United States
in i860, where he was educated in
the broad principles of our free in
stitutiona, in schools that were loyal
to the democratic ideal of govern
ment ne holds the degree of Jj.
L. Bn from the University of Mich
igan. It is fitting, indeed, in the prev
ent moment of deadly peril to lib
eral government from the organ
ized advance of political Romanism,
that the man who in our national
forum presented the demand for a
sweeping investigation of the papa!
system, should be not only an
adopted child of the world's great
est democracy, but also a son of
that Northland which at another
time of supreme peril to the cause
of progress, enlightment and true
religion, gave a hero to save the
day for Protestantism. Indeed, the
fact that Mr. Lindbergh is by birth
a Swede, naturally suggests to the
student of history
Tha Lion of tha North
Gnstams Adolphus, and his mighty
work for freedom, progress, and ad
vancing civilization.
It will be remembered that dar
ing, the dark and tragic hoar in
Europe's history known as the
Thirty Year War, there came a
day when Roman Catholicism un
der the leadership of Wallenttein
and Tilly was triumphant through
out the war waited region of con
tinental Europe. Stubbornly had
the forces of Protestantism fielded
