Office Holding Record of Family in State,

terest in "Fire Appliances."
There arc citizens who believe that
It Is contrary to good public policy In
a free country to put too many ot the
public ofllces In ono community In
the possession of members ot a single
family.
The threats made by members of
the Connery Gang to put The Eagle
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
tho Conncrys have on public affairs.
The result Is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and tho
public generally.
No wonder some of this gang ot
public payroll ornaments bcllovo that
they can use tho United States Gov
ernment in their business.
Thoy evidently havo found tho
Stato ot Illinois,
County ot Cook and
City ot Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to the family possessions.
Democrats In Chicago are wonder
ing why all of the public jobs are not
given to Connery's.
It may be duo to tho fact that there
are not enough Connorys to go around.
Connerys First I
What a noble family motto that is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party

known hankering for good--thhtgev
"State Streot Store" Blockl as you
may havo hoard him referred to, a
partner of John T. Connery In the coal
business, is a member of tho Board
of Review.
William J. Connery, nephew ot John
T. Connery, holds the nlcosalarled
Job ot Secretary of Reviewer Blockl.
Partner Blockl will run for re-election
next year, so prepare your bal
lots. Good stories of city contracts and
ot other contracts In which tho Con
nery connections were alleged to have
been Interested are not so far forgot
ten that the public Interest In them
aver wholly died out
There was a numbor ot talented
Democratic leaders who held office or
contracts' under the Busse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of these
worthies before as our files will at
test. But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
it about.
Democrats do not forget the dose
that some members of the Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne In 1007 when
lie was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many In
the light of the Royal Family of the
Democratic party, entitled to most,
if not to all, ot the Jobs In lta gift,
the Connery's are alleged to have
given such great support to Busse
and to have worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Busse's gratitude was
great.
When John W. Ralney, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk ot the Circuit Court
In 1913, the Connery outfit fought
him at the polls In favor ot Joseph
E. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
When Robert M. Sweltzer was run
ning for the Democratic nomination
for Mayor in 1915, the Connerys saw
another chance to put a member ot the
family In that office and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller of the
Sanitary District ot Chicago.
But the Democratlo stomach was
showing signs of balking at an over--diet
of Connery and the noble Francis
D. was sent back to the payroll to
-wait for another chance.
Sweltzer got the nomination and It
Is said that the Connery following
did not forgive him for crowding out
one ot the princes ot the blood and
were aot over-enthuslastle for Sweit
xer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are aot
asking tor much.
It Is reported that Joseph B. Bid
will, Jr.. son-ia-law ot John T. Coa
fiery' will not seek Republics aoal

CONNERY TAXES
Items About Them, Gleaned from Printed
Personal Property Assessments; Also,
the Taxes Levied on Labor Unions.
The public Is naturally anxious to
know what personal property taxes
its office holders pay. So much has
been said about the number of Con
neryB holding public office In Chicago
that many inquiries have been made
as to what personal property assess
ments are laid against these patriotic
persons by the Board ot Assessors.
The printed lists of personal proper
ty assessments for 1916 show tho fol
lowing facts:

Tho levying of an assessment of fivo

to such ConneryB as nro running for
office this year.
mentioned in public life, Mr. John T.
Connery, partner in the coal business
of Revlewor Blockl, resides, does not
disclose any assessment against that
gentleman which Is surprising In view
of the fact that many think him a mil
lionaire. He is a brother of Joseph F. Michael
M., Henry T Francis D etc., etc.
J. T. Connerys name does not ap
pear on the printed assessment list
which includes tho territory In which
his business offico at 332 South Mich
igan avenuo Is located, In District 20,
town of South Chicago.
Labor organizations do not appear
to escape the vigilance of tho Asses

A large number of other assess

might be quoted.
But what's tho use?
These from one district, District
9, South Town, are enough.
People looking for the Edgewater
Beach Hotel, 6325 Sheridan Road, said
to be owned in part by the Connerys
would look In vain for it It they
searched the 1916 printed assessment
roll of District No, 4, town of Lake

POOR VOTE GETTERS
Although the Connerys Hold
Many Public, Jobs They Are
Not Strong at the Ballot
Box.
At tho Democratic primary for Re
corder ot Deeds In 1912 tho result
was:
Joseph F. Connory 50,343
His opponents 64,493
So Connery was a minority nomi
nee. At tho samo primary John W. Ral
ney ran for tho nomination for Clerk
ot the Circuit Court, tho offico held by
Connery's Republican nephow-ln-law,
Joseph E. Bldwell, Jr. Result ot tho
primary: ,
John W. Ralney 71,695
All opponents 44,666
Ralney's majority over
all 27,029
At the same primary in 1912 John
T. Connery's partner in tho coal busi
ness, Blockl, was a candldato for tho
nomination for Board of Review. Tho
result:
Blockl, Connery's part
ner 39,415
His opponents 87,253
So Blockl, Connory's partner, was in
a minority of 47,838 votes. One of his
opponents, Charles J. Voplcku, cainu
near defeating Block!, Connery's part
ner, receiving 38,989 votes to Blockl,
Connery's partner's 39,415.
In 1913, Francis D. Connory was a
candldato at the Democratic primary
for tho nomination for City Clerk.
Tho candidates besides Connery were
Joseph M. Coffey, F. II. Landmossor,
Fred L. Yeager, John C. Guonthor,
Randall E. Marshall and Vincent S.
Zwletka. Tho rosult:
Francis D. Connery 42,187
Ills Democratic opponents 51,460
So Connery was very much of a
minority candldato.
