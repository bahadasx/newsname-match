$THIBODEAUX OPPOSES
DARIUS M. FONTENOT
WELL KNOWN POLITICIAN MENTIONED AS PROBA
BLE OPPONENT OF DARIUS FONTENOT FOR
UNEXPIRED SHERIFF TERM
a It is pretty well settled
fact that Charlqy Thibodeaux,
for many years prominent in
parish politics, will oppose
Darius M. Fontenot, assessor
of St. Landry, for sheriff. Mr.
Fontenot announced during
the early part of the week,
and since he ventured into the
field for the unexpired term,
caused by the death of Sher
iff Swords, his political ene
mies lave been busy organiz
ing opposition to the little
. "Cajan."
Char.ey Thibodeaux made
a formal announcement of his
candidacy on Thursday morn
ing, and his friends have been
;flocking to him, so that formi
:dable opposition to the Fon
4ý tenot- -Andrus-Chachere--Las
strapes combination could ' be
put in the field.
Several candidates for sher,
iff of the old Swords faction
havg been mentioned, notably
J. J. Stagg, Judge, Vannoy,
: Plais Horn and Dr. R. M. Lit
tell. It appeared as though
.the sentiment of the old
SSwords guard was leaning
-towards Dr. Stagg, but when
he emphitically declined to
enter the race, the political
wiseacres had to look to one
of-their other men upon whom
they could center. As Char
: ley Thibodeaux was identified
i` with the Swords faction dur
jing the last campaign it is
,pretty evident that he will
. have the almost solid support
of the leaders of that side of
t'he political house of St. Lan
The friends of both Fonte
iaot and Thibodeaux claim that
"Ithe race will be interesting,
and, both sides are sure that
F`victory will rest with them.
The campaign, which is ex
.ted to open in earnest the
GAR DUPRE TO. BE.
SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER
Wi1ell Known Farmer Urged
for Vacancy on Board
. In all probabilities Edgar
T Dupre, a well known and
1' progressive farmer, who re
side about three or four miles
front Opelousas, in the Plai
sance section, will replace J.
Austin Perkins, as member of
the school board from this
·ward. Mr. Perkins' term ex
pires this fall and being busy
with his bank has decided to
~:give up his place to some one
' else. Those who know Mr.
:,- Dupre readily agree that he
Swould make the best possible
`:member, being a very con
a:scientious worker, a believer
of good schools, a progressive
farmer and having All quali
fications that go to ake -up
an ideal member of the edu
cation board.
Mr. Dupre has not consent
j ed to submit his name to the
- people of this ward, but it is
':i understood his friends will
compel him to do so. He has
.t.he solid endorsement of the
people of Plaisance, and every
.man in Opelousas and Belle
vFue who knows E. T. Dupre
:feels that there could be no
ibetter choice for the position.
Should Mr. Dcpre consent
-to make the race it is under
i:stood that he will not have any
~iopposition; not being a fac
.:tional man, but always an in
dependent voter, he is agree
·iable to all political factions in
-'this ward, and would conse
quently make a splendid and
creditable member of the par
U ish school board.
Opelousas as it is now has
three of the four members
from tU'is ward and in justice
to the Plaisance people Mr.
D Dupre is being urged as the
:choice of that section of the
rrward. With Mr. Dupre on the
Sboard every section of the
ward would be efficiently
-represented.
SThe country people feel that
Opelousas should yield to
their demand in this respect
-as this place will still have two
"nembers on the board in the
person of H. DI). Larcade, Jr.,
:, axd Edgar Andrepont. both of
w-whou reside and vote in Ope
'JQ.Usas. ,
early part of next week, .will
unquestionably prove one of
the most interesting ever pull
ed off in.St. Landry parish.
As most of the old factional
bitterness will be wiped
away by'the time election day
rolls around there is no doubt
in the minds of 'those who
seem to appreciate the politi
cal situation that the race will
be exceedingly excitng.
Mr. Fontenot and Mr. Thib
odeaux have both bucked up
against the old sheriff, the
first being defeated in 1916 by
Sheriff Swords by 96 yotes out
of a total of approrimately
3500 votes, while in 1912
Thibodeaux was nosed out in
an exciting contest by the
dead sheriff by 92 votes out of
a total of 2500. The friends
of both Fontenot and Thibo
deaux claim that they are
about on an equal level, one
being about as strong as the
other.
As both candidates will
have a formidable organiza
tion back of them .the fight is
pretty apt. to be a line up orie
on each side, in which. event
the individual popularity of
either of the candidates will
not count for much.
The election will probably
be called on the same day as
the judicial -election, if reports
from Baton Rouge are correct,
as it is claimed that Governor
Pleasant has r'uled that the
sixty-day clause in the elec
tions for filling vacancies is il
legal; should Governor Pleas
ant act accordingly it is logi
cally concluded that he will
so arrange his proclamation of
election so that the election of
sheriff, district attorney and
district judge, as well as con
gressman will come off on the
same day.
SOYA BEANS?, W
CROP FOR FARMERS
Cotton Seed Crushers' Official
Points Out Advantages
The soya bean, the cultiva
tion of which is being encour
aged in Louisiana by Commis
sioner of Agriculture Wilson,
will keep the Louisiana cotton
oil mills runiing .eight months
out" of the year, according to
Bryan Bell, secretary of the
Louisiana Cotton Seed Crush
ers' Association.
The soya bean is now large
ly grown in the Carolinas,
where it brings to the farmer
from $1 to $1.15 per bushel
Che cultivation in Louisiana
would be, according to Mr.
Wilson, easier and more pro
lific. The cotton oil mills will
be able to handle the bean
without interferance with their
cotton seed crushing industry,
the additional crushing pro
cess requiring only the slight
addition of mechanical im
provements to the present
plants.
Commissioner Wilson visited
both North and South Caro
lina. The mills in the Caroli
nas have been paying from $1
to $1.15 per bushel, so the dol
lar standard may be regarded
assure. The mills pay cash
and store the beans until they
finish with the cotton seed, as
their is no danger of deteriora
tion and the weevils do not
bother. After gathering at
least a $40 an acre crop of
beans, the farmers will still
have the vines left for hay
which lhas been analyzed as
more nutritious than wheat,
bran, or alfalfa for feed. That
will make the beans pay more
than cotton or corn, for the cot
ton stalks are worthless as
feed.--Dailey States.

GUILLORY DENIES HE
LOAN CARRIERE HORSE
Pot Cove Negro Says Report
In New Orleans Paper
Is False
'Jean Baptiste Guillory, a
negro farmer of the Pot Cove
section of this parish, near
which place Hilaire Carriece
murdered Sheriff Marion L.
Swords on Monday morning,
July 17th, in a letter to tine
editor of the Clarion denies
most emphatically that he
loan a horse to the murderer
to make -his escape. Guiliory
is at a loss how the report got
out and was finally printed in
New Orleans papers.
Following is the letter ad
dressed to the Clarion from
Guilloiy y:
"I have read in the New, O'
leans papers that there is a ra
mor to the effect ,that Hilaire
Carriere, who is wanted -f.r
the killing of Sheriff M. L.
Swords had procured a horse
from me to make his-escape..
There is absolutely no truth in
this rumor, as I have never
seen Carriere since the kIing
of Sheriff Swords.
"I~indly give this coinniuni
cation space in your valuable
paper."
It was claimed that Carriere
had procured a horse from
some one in the neighborhood,
right after the assassination
of Sheriff Swords, and in that
manner evaded the hounds,
who were trailing the otlaw..

RURAL SibllHOLS WILL
OPEN IN OQTOBER
School Board Acts EIavorably
on Farmers Recommendation
NEW LAW CAUSES! MANY
TO HESTITATE TO ENROLL
Country Children Will Be
Able to Assist Parents in
Harvesting Their Crops
The school board, at its
meeting here last Wqinesday
morning, acted favor*ly on
the recommendation of the
farmers of this parish, through
the St. Landry Farme Union,
and accordingly ordred the
rural schools to open pn the
last Monday of Octo~r, in
stead 'of the middle of Septem
.ber, as was originally planned.
At the meeting of ~l par
ish Union-. ,.elf ;a 'a
last week the question was dis
cussed and it was agreed by
the farmers present that, un
der the new state educational
law, compelling children en
rolled to attend school so many
days out of the year, the rural
children would be afraid to
enroll, as their presence was
required on the farm.
President R. Lee Mills ap
peared before the school
board and made known the
wishes of the farmers of this
parish; he argued that a ma
jority of the farmers needed
their children on the farm dur
ing September and October in
order to harvest the cotton and
corn crops; many farmers had
threatened not to send their
children to school at all, should
the schools open early, on ac
count of the new education
law that compels children en
rolled to attend school a re
quired length of time.
The school board readily
understood - and appreciated
the situation, and as the school
term will only be six months
in the majority of the rural
schools there was no objection
raised to open the country
schools the last week of Oc
tober.
FARMERS PREPARING
TO HARVEST THEIR RICE
Early Crop Is Almost Ready
for Reaper and Binder
Within the next few days
there will be seen hundreds of
farmers in the nearby fields
harvesting their early rice
crop. Many reapers and bind
ers will be seen buzzing in the
golden field, bringing to St.
Landry ftrmers money by th,
thousands.
The rice crop in this par
ish is the best seen in years,
one hundred per cent better
in some localities than last
year, and every farmer who
has a patch of rice is. wearing
a big smile these days.
If weather conditions are
not severe the harvest of the
early crop -should . prove a;
source of satisfaction to all
those who are preparing to
go into the fields within the
next few days to harvest
their crop

The Abbeville-Opelousas
game which was scheduled for
last Sunday and which was
called off on account of in
clement weather will take
place to-morrow afternoon.
As the Abbeville team is con
sidered very strong and since
the local boys have been con
siderably strengthened a very
exciting and interesting game
is promised to the local fans.
Should the weather prove
ideal a large crowd will turn
out, if present indications are
correct. Opelousas is one of
the best baseball towns in
Louisiana and now that the
home team is going good once
again it is reasonably expected
that the fans will give their
support to the local club.

SUGAR REFINERY MADE
READY FOR OPERATION
Opelousas Mill Is Renovated
And Good Season Expected
The Opelousas Sugar Re
finery, which was organized by
local capitalists several years
ago, but which was operated
for only a few hours, is now,
in the best of conditions. The
new owners of the local sugar
mill have remodelled and ren
ovated and the entire plant to
day it is one of the best in this
section of the state.
Crockett-Weil, owners of
the refinery, are prepared to
make syrup and sugar, and
consequently the cane farmers
of St. Landry and neighboring
parishes are assured of a good
price for their output of cane.
It is expected that a good
season will be enjoyed by the
new owners, and it is pointed
out that if the sugar refinery
succeeds, as it is believed it
Iwill thousands of acres of
land in this piarish will pro
duce sugar cane next year.
Many local people have
gone over the sugar mill plant
which is situated on the Ben
nett plantation, four miles
from this city. The plant is
pound to be in splendid condi
tion and there is no chance of
failure this year. The oper
ators expect to open the sea

I cane from the surrounding
country.

FRIiENDS OF SWORDS
MEET AT COURTHOUSE
POLITICAL LEADERS OF N EARLY EVERY PRECINCT
IN ST. LANDRY GATHER TO DISCUSS THE POLITI.
CAL SITUATION CAUSED BY SHERIFF'S DEATH
A representative crowd of
voters, for years intimate and
political friends of Sheriff
Marion L. Swords, met at the
courthouse on last Sunday af
ternoon for the purpose of dis
cussing the political situation,
as caused by the sudden and
tragic death of the once chief
tain of the Swords faction.
Several of the most promi
nent men of this parish, who
have in the past taken active
part in politics, made stirring
speeches advocating the bring
ing out of a candidate against
Darius M. Fontenot, mentioned
as the choice of the Garland
Pavy faction. When the
question was put to a vote in
the house, practically every
man seated, arouse to signify
his willingness to battle for
some friend of the dead sher
iff.
A committee, composed of
two from each ward, was ap
pointed for the purpose of
feeling the pulse of the voters
throughout the parish as to a
probable 6andidate. This
committee was instructed to
make known its finding at a
meeting in this city.

Annual Convention of Farmets
Union Proves A Source -of
Satisfaction to the Leaders
One of the most successful i
conventions of the " Farmers 4
Union was culminated on
Wednesday n ight, afier a w '
days strenuous meeting. t
While the attendance was not
very large, the spirit and en
thusiasm was there in profu
sion and it is safe to say that r
the Union will grow in the
next twelve months like it
never has before.
The convention was opened
Tuesday morning,when Hon.
Dudley L. Guilbeau, in behalf
of the city, delivered a splen
did address of welcome; his ]
views of the Farmers Union
were so well expressed, that
the big guns in the organiza
tion, throughout the conven
tion, would refer to some of
the apt remarks of Mr. Gull
beau, who is a fluent and sil
ver tongued orator.. National
President Charles S. Barrett,
the next speaker, delivered a
"heart to heart" talk on the 4
Union; he was follow by Dr.
Ladislas Lazaro. represPntaive
of the Seventh Louisiana Con
gressioal District, who urged
all the farmers to orgb-nize in
to one organization and to re
solve never to attempt to do
anything, except by co-opera
tion. Dr. Lazaro was compli
mented by the Union officials
for his record in Congress, as
he always voted right on every
question bearing on the agri
cultural interests of his sec
tion, according to remarks by
President Barrett, who kept a
close tab on the St. Landry
man. W. P. Young, on Farm
ers Union, W. A. Bowen, on
the Press, and E. P. Gueymard
on railroads, delivered force
ful and pleasing addresses, all
of which were greatly enjoyed.
The Union went on record
as being unanimously in favor
of the New Orleans Farm and
Live Stock ' Show, which was
represented at ;the convention
by I. B. Nennyson, manager of
the show. Strong resolutions
recommending the show and
assuring the aid of the Union
to Mr. Rennyson were adopt
ed.
The Union also appointed a
committee to co-operate with
Martin Behrman in endeavor
ing to secure for New Orleans
one of the national farm loan
banks. This committee will
go to Washington, D. C., if
many, it was only the gather
ing of representative men who
are anxious to secure the can
didacy of the strongest and
most available man in this par
ish, who is willing to go out
and make the fight for politi
cal supremacy of this parish
and keeping together of the'.
ild Swords lines.
,Men from almost"ievery pre
cinct in the parish, .oters who
are influential and iho know
,olitical conditions readily an
swered the appeal of the .
many local friends of the dead
sheriff and journeyed to Ope
lousas, through boggy road
and inclement weather, in or
der to register their approval :
of opposition against the can
didacy of young Fontenot.
The meeting not only dis.:;
cussed political conditions buit
deplored, with much feelgib,
the terrible tragedy in Mallet. =s
