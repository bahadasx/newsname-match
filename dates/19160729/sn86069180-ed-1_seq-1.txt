Great enthusiasm was shown at
the convention of tho Ancient Order
of Hibernians at the Copley-Plaza
"Wednesday morning, when Rev.
Philip J. O'Donnell scored the dis
missal of tho appeal of Sir Roger
Casement, and urged tho delegates
assembled to adopt strong resolu
tions condemning the action of the
British Government. Tho delegates,
without a dissenting vote, carried
out Father O'Donnell's suggestion.
After passage they were sent to the
American Ambassador in London
and Bishop O'Dwyer, of Limerick.
The same action was taken In the
convention of the Ladies' Auxiliary.
The rest of the session was taken
up with the report of officers and
the reading of a long letter of con
gratulation and encouragement from
Cardinal O'Connell.
The Ladies' Auxiliary held their
session in Convention Hall and were
visited by Cardinal O'Connell, ac
companied by Rev. Joseph C. Cop
plnger, P. R., and Rev. Philip J.
O'Donnell. Cardinal O'Connell made
a short address, In which 'ho praised
the Irish woman for her purity and,
loyalty. Ho then offered the prayer
of the convention in English, after
which Rev. Patrick N. McDermott,
of Massena, Chairman of the Irish
History Committee of that State,
said the same prayer in Gaelic. Mrs.
Ellen Ryan Jolly, tho National
President, reported on the Irish
question at length and also the plan
for the memorial to Catholic nuns
who lost their lives in the civil war.
Thursday morning there was a
solemn requiem masB for deceased
members and two business sessions
of the Hibernians and Ladles' Aux
iliary, hearing reports and spirited
discussions. At nightJtheJolnt ban
quet was held at the Copley-Plaza
Hotel, when addresses were deliv
ered by Gov. McCall, Mayor Curley,
Hon. Claude G. Bowers, Hon. James
A. Gallivan, Hon. Peter F. Tague,
Hon. Alexander A. Rorke, Rev.
Philip J. O'Donnell, Hon. Francis
J. Horgan and Matthew Cummlngs.
Much business was transacted FrU
day. John O'Dea, of Philadelphia,
Chairman of tho Resolutions Com
mittee, made his report, and tho
resolutions were adopted without
discussion. The resolutions con
demning the British Government for
the verdict in the case of Sir Roger
Casement were passed without op
position. The following cablegram
was presented by Rev. Patrick N.
Turner, of Iowa, to be sent to Sir
Roger Casement:
"We, the members of the Ancient
Order of Hibernians or America, in
National convention assembled, are
with you In spirit and desire to tell
you, In life, that your efforts for
Ireland's independence will never be
forgotten and your memory shall
ever remain green In the hearts of
Irish men and women throughout
the world."
The resolutions on "Hyphenated
Americans" declared: "The political
circulation of tho catch phrase
'Hyphenated American' Is aimed
mischievously at Irish-Americans
as much, perhaps, as at any other
race which Is embodied In our cit
izenship. We are proud of the race
to which we belong, and there Is
no reproach In the 'hyphen' when
applied to Americans of the Irish
race, The race In America has
never divided their loyalty to Amer
ica, either in tho hour of peril or
in the times of peaceful quietude."
The delegates pledged their al
legiance to the Catholic church and
to aid in tho extension of that faith.
The Federation of Catholic socle
ties was endorsed as the first of all
Influential Catholic organizations.
Resolutions were offered urging a
vigorous membership campaign,
which were adopted. Education, the
Irish history movement, publication
of a history of the order, the mil
itary branches, the Ladies' Aux
iliary, the Gaelic revival and the dis
tribution of literature were en
dorses. The convention declared for the
open door on tho question of im
migration and disapproved tho prin
ciples of Socialism.
A memorial church to Rev.
Father Abram Ryan, the poet-priest
of Mobile, Ala., tho gifts to tne
Catholic Church Extension Society
and establishing a homo for aged
Hibernians were also included In
the resolutions.
Tho convention voted to assist the
families and dependents of mem
bers who are enlisted In the service
of their country at the Mexican bor
der and keep their dues paid.
The closing session on Saturday
was the largest held, because of
the contest for the various officers
of the National Board and the
choice of a place for the next con
vention, which was captured by San
Francisco. National President Mc
Laughlin was re-elected, aB were1
the other officers with the excep
tion of Secretary Philip J. Sullivan,
who becomes a National Director
nnd la succeeded by Thomas J.
Matthews, of Providence. The offi-
Wr were Installed by Past National
President Regan and retiring Vice
President Charles Foy, of Canada.
The National officers elected by
the Ladles' Auxiliary are Mrs. Mary
McWhortor, Chicago, President;
Mrs. Adella Christy, Cleveland, Vice
President; Mrs. Susan M. McNamee,
Medford, Secretary; Miss Margaret
McQuade, Pennsylvania, Treasurer;
Mrs. Susan Robinson, Richmond,
and Mrs. Mary Arthur, Indianapolis,
National delegates.
.Mayor Curley addressed the dele
gates shortly before tho voting be
gan. After a tribute to tho aux
iliary, Mrs. Ellen Ryan Jolly, the
retiring President, brought forward
a large delegation of mothers, whose
sons are now on tho Mexican border,
to meet the Mayor, and the women
in the audience rose and sang "The
Star Spangled Banner." Tho Mayor
in closing said that lie was glad to
Bee that the members of the A. O.
H. knew the words of our national
hymn. He cited an instance at the
time of the Spanish war in 1898.
When tho news of Dewey's victory
was flashed to the members of the
United States Senate one Senator
suggested that the members rise and
sing "The Star Spangled Banner."
All rose, but not a man sang be
yond the first two lines.
DOMINICAN ELECTION.
Representatives of the religious
order of St. Dominic, known as the
Order of Preachers, aro. gathering
In Rome from all parts of the world
and within a short time will elect
a Master General. The American
representatives left for Bordeaux, en
route to the Holy City, about the
mlddlo of the month, among them
being Very Rev. J. Raymond
Meagher, O. P., Provincial of the
order in Now York. The term of
office for the Dominican Master
General is twelve years. The Very
Rev. Hyacinth M. Cormier, who Is
now In his eighty-fifth year, com
pleted last May his term as General.
By Apostolic authority he continued
In office until the delegates can be
assembled for the election. The
troublesome times have naturally
caused many delays. Those par
ticipating in the election represent
the governing and the governed ele
ments of the order. There is no or
der in the whole church so demo
cratic in its government.
The following American fathers
will participate in the elective chap
ter: Very Rev. Raymond Meagher,
New York City; A. L. McMahon,

Ore.; F. A. O'Rourke, Antioch, Cal.;
Louis Perez, New Orleans; J. B.
Moore, British West Indies.
CONTRARY TO RULE.
During the present torrid season
it is the customary rule with all
fraternal societies to meet and only
transact routine business, adjourn
ing quickly, and no discussions or
talks prolonging the sessions, but the
meeting of Division 4, A. O. H., in
Bertrand Hall Monday evening
proved an exception. A good at
tendance was present, and strange
to say nearly every one present
tried his hand at discussing the
questions before the house and in
stead of an early adjournment
President John Hennessy had a hard
time In shutting off debates after a
three hours' session. And to show
that they were still ripe for argu
ment a motion to hold another
meeting was only beaten by one
vote. Con Ford, Joe Lynch, Fred
Mooney, Tom Downey, T. J. Langan
and Tom Lynch were leaders In the
fray dll evening, .and all agreed that
it was a rousing meeting of the old
style type. John Riley, Joseph Hen
nessy and John B. O'Daly were
telected to membership and the ap
plication of Tim Kelly was re
ceived. CATHOLIC WEEK.
The week beginning Sunday,
August 20, will be known as "Cath
olic week" in New York City the
following Catholic societies and or
ganizations to meet there; Tho
American Federation of Catholic So
cieties, the German Roman Catholic
Central Verein, the Catholic Young
Men's National Union, tho Gonzaga
Union, the New York State League
of the Central Verein nnd tho New
York State Federation of Catholic
Societies. Cardinal Farley, Cardinal
Gibbons, Cardinal O'Connell, the
Most Rev. John Bonzano, Apostolic
Delegate, and many Archbishops
and Bishops will be present. On
Sunday. August' 20, Pontifical high
mass will be sung at St. Patrick's
Cathedral by Cardinal Farley, and
Cardinal Gibbons will preach tho
sermon. John Whalen, President of
tho American Federation of Catholic
Societies, will preside at a mass
meeting to bo held in the Hippo
drome. Cardinal Farley will speak
and the musical numbers will be
furnished by the Metropolitan Opera
House Orchestra and German Choral
Societies.
GOOD WORK DONE.
Not tho least interesting of the
many reports to be mado at the
Supreme convention or the Knights
of Columbus at Davenport next
week will be that .of the Commis
sion on Religious Prejudices, of
"which Col. P. H. Callahan, of Louis
ville, Is the Chairman This body
was created by the Supremo con
vention two years ago to study
the causes for the widespread re
ligious bigotry that seemed to be
prevalent, and was given an appro
priation of ?50;000 with' which to
carry on Its work. That It has ac
complished much along the lines for
which It was created there is no
doubt and its report will be listened
to with rapt attention.

of the Cabinet, repudiates the
Lloyd-George-Devlin agreement in a
second statement, demanding that
the bill be submitted to the voters
and predicts tho defeat of the
measure. Ho says that England
will not reward Irish treason and
that the Government is being held
up by revolutionists. John Red
mond, having refused to call a Na
tional convention according to cus
tom., an independent convention is
to be held in Dublin, which is ex
pected to take a strong stand
against the scheme to dismember
Ireland. Redmond has staked his
leadership of the Parliamentary
party on the measure, and the sur
render of the Lords and the defeat
of his opponents in Ireland he
predicts. Premier Asqulth hints
that further concessions will have
to be made by Lord Lansdowne be
fore tho bill will be accepted. The
inquiries into the disastrous Meso

SHEER FAIRNESS AND HUMANITY
Tho following article by a writer
In the current number of the Bap
tist World, a local publication, calls
(ttention to the fact that the meth
ods and tactics employed by the
Menace are an Incentive and pro
motive of religious persecution. The
writer discusses seriously the non

lishers, his only mistake being that

is the graft from the poor dupes
who read and swallow Its wild-eyed
warnings and inflammatory utter
ances. The article is as follows:

f n nnfj tn rincr thflm on an lmasE-

well-nigh being persecution.
Now I'm an old-fashioned Bap
tist, and couldn't be anything else
so long as I understand the New
Testament as I do, and there's not
much danger of my having any
change of view on tho subject. Be
ing a Baptist, I am for liberty, and
therefore am opposed to even a sem
blance of persecution, no matter
how it Is masked or plausibly dis
guised. Let every tub stand on Its
own bottom, no matter whose tub
It Is. So long as the spirit of the
constitution is compiled with, I am
for anybody, worshiping his way.
All this is suggested by the policy
of a paper which has gained wide
circulation throughout the country,
which paper is called tho Menace.
The "menace" resisted by that pa
per Is the Roman Catholic system
of America. While I am about as
far from sympathy with the views
and principles of the Roman Cath
olics as one can well be, and while
I know the history of the system
tolerably well, I don't at all share
In the policy of a paper that not
only Imagines dire disasters and
predicts havoc, but magnifies these
dreams of distortion and seeks to
t-raat thorn as fartta. ThndA thinefl
are not facts, and yet the Menace
exploHs them as though they were,
and seeks to Influence the public
mind as though they wore actual.
So long as the Monaco confines
itself to facts that make against
the public weal, and exposes the
corruption of Rome, purely as a
matter of fact, I am with It; but I
decline to go with it in its fancied
predictions and to act on these as
though they were In actual exist
ence. I am opposed to the whole
business on the score of fairness,
and will go further and say that I
do not share in the alarm that the
Menace seeks to raise, and positively
decline to participate In the in
flammation of sentiment which that
paper seeks to produce. It will be
time enough for Inflammation when
these supposed or imagined things
come to pass. It is Idle to say that
It will then be too late. I do not
believe a word of it. This country
is too Intelligent, too cautious, too
wise and too wide-awake to suppose
for a moment that any system can
bo clandestinely nurtured and main
tained to tho extent of disrupting
and bring about the dire ruin that
abides, Tor the most part, in the
imaginary compartment of the brain
of the Menace.
Looking at its attitude and policy,
its utterances nnd wild predictions,
there Is danger of the Menace per
secuting while seeking to provide
against persecution. Tho logic of
the whole business Is that we con
stitutionally provide for the Roman
Catholic church and then turn
.round and make it as intolerable for
it to exist in America as possible.
If everybody outside Roman Cathol
icism agreed with the Menace wo
should practically say: "Yes, come
along; you have as much right here
as anybody, but understand that we
aro going to make it as hot for you
as we can. We are going to ding
dong at you and make you rue ever
wishing to plant yourselves on
American soil." That Is precisely
where the logic of the Menace car
ries It. I submit that It would be
much more honorable and fair just
to raise the barrier of intolerance
outright and say to the Roman
Catholics: 'We draw the line on
you; you must bo excepted from the
universal principle embodied in tho
first article of the constitution,
which provides that all religionists,
of whatever possible type, may wor
ship as they wish."
I am very far from defendine or
advocating the Roman Catholic re
ligion; that Is their business; but I
am just as far from building a plat-'
form of imagination or of pure sup-j
position and proceed to dog and
ding-dong everlasting from this airy !
position. This Is In tho Interest of
sheer fairness and humanity. The
uoman catholic has a right to be
here; he has a right to worship and
conduct his system his own way;
and we have a Tight to criticize it,
to expose it as much as we please,
to call all the attention to it we
wish, to show that It is decidedly
.undemocratic in its tendency. If that!
can ne established, to go back and
show what Its history has been and
.ill else-; but when we undertake to
Infer and conclude from certain
premises what the outcome will be,
treat those Inferences as facts and
proceed to fan a flame of sentiment
on these arbitrary inferences ex
cuse me.
The basest criminal has rights
that must be respected, and unless
we propose to close our eyes to one
of the fundamental rocks of our
constlttulon, we can not go to the
length to which this self-same Men
ace goes. These people are humans,
they are citizens of the national
faferlc, and it Is more than a mis
take or blunder to pursue a policy
like the one pointed out it is
wrong.
It is nonsense to share in the
conclusion of the Menace. Were the
Roman Catholics to undertake to do
what the Monaco indicates, the anti
clerical spirit of America would
make that of Franco child's play.
It is unfair, unpatriotic, unmanly
and Inhuman, and more, unchristian
to Join In a hue and cry like that
raised by the Menace.
VINCENTIANS.
Members of the St. Vincent de
Paul Society of this city made an
excellent showing Sunday morning
at St. Elizabeth's church, when
over 500 received holy communion
In celebration of the feast of their
patron, who was the great exemplar
of true Christian charity. Rev.
Father Assent was the ceelbrant of
the mass, and in a forceful and
eloquent sermon he expressed his
delight to have the society visit his
church, really one of the finest in
the diocese. In the afternoon tho
Vlncentlans again assembled, filling
the Knights of Columbus hall.
President John A, Doyle occupied
the chair and Rev. Eugene Donohue
offered the prayers. Reports of
conferences were read and showed
that in all parts of the city much
real charity work was being done.
The address was delivered by tho
Rev. Father Baxter, O. P., of St.
Louis Bertrand's, and was one that
inspired every one who heard him.
Quite a number of now members
wore received into tne society uy
President Doyle, who declared tho
day's observance reflected great
credit on the Catholic men of
Louisville.
NOW SERGEANT CHESTER.
Boyd Chesjer, tho well known
Twin City League star and member

Republican Campaign Commit
tee Not Exactly Satisfied With
Hughes' Progress.
AXTON'S FIGHT FOR CONTROL
Tho Republican National Cam
paign Committee is far from satis
fled with the progress of tho Hughes
candidacy and tho improvement
looked forward to this past week
has failed to materialize. There id
a lack of life at the headquarters;
too much recognition of the Pro
gressives and a reawkening of tho
old quarrel between, the latter and
the old-line Republicans. In tho
different State conventions the Pro
gressives have balked at indorsing
Hughes despite the efforts of tho
leaders, and strange to say, despite
the advice of their former chieftain
Roosevelt. Nominee Hughes Is do
ing everything In his power to stir
up interest, but unfortunately is not
a rousing campaigner or mixer. His
political successes in the past were
dud to public sentiment which car
ried him into office. Ho has never
been tho popular Idol of tho people,
only the instrument which the pub
lic used to accomplish its end. Right
now there is no real enthusiasm In.
the Republican party and a pul
motor Is needed to revive Interest.
As stated last week In these col
umns, President Wilson has the op
portunity of his political career and
the success or failure of tho Demo
cratic party throughout the United
States depends upon his action with
Great Britain. The President must
make a firm stand and call tho
hand of John Bull in the present
series of high-handed insults and
outrages being meted out to tho
people of tho United States. In the
Senate the other day Senator Mar
tine, of Now Jersey, said: "Great
Britain has dictated policies to tho
United States and attempted to con
trol our foreign and domestic con
duct. She has dictated our policy
with je.gard to" tho building ot the
Panama canal, which wo built and
paid for; she has rifled our malls,
bho has stopped every American ship
that sails the seas at her ovr pleas
ure, and taken them Into her own
ports for examination; and now wo
are helplessly awaiting her next
move." Senator Martine might
have added tho story of tho black
list and boycott of American firms;
the refusal to allow the Irish Relief
Committee to land with aid for the
sufferers whom England has Impris
oned and persecuted; the entrance
Into American waters of a British
cruiser, and the latest, the refusal
to allow Publisher McClure, a rep
resentative American, to cross Eng
lish" soil.
In thr above is President Wilson's
opportunity from not only the stand
point of Democrats, but also from
the standpoint of any true Ameri
can citizen who resents the actions
of this bully. It is believed that
if the Presidont doesn't act then
Congress will forco action, but as
stated above, it Is Wilson's oppor
tunity, and on his position depends
the success or failure of the Demo
cratic party, not only In the Presi
dent's race, but In every contest
throughout tho nation. A ringing
rebuke of England and a demand
for an explanation of her conduct
will secure for him the support of
the American people In the great
majority, the only dissenters being
the Tory Americans and paid pro
English press.
The local fight for the Republican
Congressional nomination waxes
warmer every day and the man
chosen to oppose Congressman Sher
ley will have a badly split party be
hind him. Aside from the combina
tion of Owens and Brunec to beat
Dr. Ryans, the popular choice, thero
Is being staged an effort for the
come-back of Wood Axton, the
Mayoralty Bull Moose choice in
1913. Axton alms to secure control
of the Republican machinery and In
addition to landing the nomination
for Mayor will attempt to dictate
the whole municipal ticket next
year. The combination behind
Owens Is Axton, Chilton and Searcy,
backed by the Junior Order or
