Attorney General Asks County Attorney
to Aid Him in Investigating Im
portant Question
The attorney general of Oklahoma is
on the trail of those who may be re
sponsible for the high price of gaso
line and has asked County Attorney
Veuable to aid him in his quest,
Cheap gasoline for all users In Okla
homa Is the state officer's aim and the
county attorney will, with the aid of
those who have data available, assist
him in this work. The following let
ter has been received by Mr. Veua
ble: Dear Sir: '
This office has filed a complaint be-;
fore the Corporation Commission
against all tho oil companies doing
business in this state, for the pur
pose of having the commission make
an order fixing the maximum price,
and, also, requiring the selling of pe
troleum products, more especially gas
oline, at a uniform piee throughout
the state, after making allowances for
difference in quality and transporta
tion charges.
In order to facilitate this investiga
tion, 1 desire that you produce the fol
lowing information and send same to
this office at your earliest conven
ience: (a) The names of the retail dealers
in gasoline in your county, as neat' as
may be, and the price at which they
are now selling gasoline, and the price
at which they have sold the same dur
ing the past sixty days;
ib) The names of the wholesale
dealers selling to retailers in your
county, and the price at which they
sell the same to the different retail
dealers;
(c) The kind and quality of the
gasoline, as near as may be, and
where the same was refined; also the
difference in the freight rates from
the different refinery points to the
points in your county, as near as may
be ascertained, and Btich other infor
mation or suggestions as you think
beneficial to this investigation.
I would, also, like to have the name
of some person in' your county who is
familiar with the facts asked for in
this letter, and who would be availa
ble as a witness to testify in the hear
ing in this case.
This office appreciates the fact that
the Information sought will entail
some trouble to your office, but on ac
count of the immense amount of data
to be secured and the very short time
In which the -office- has to procure the
same, it is' necessary that the assist
ance of the county attorneys be en
listed to this end.
I trust you will be able to give me
t'n'si information, without it working
too much hardship on your office.
When the same is all available, we sin
cerely hope to give the people of the
state some needed relief from the
conditions now existing. I am
Very truly yours,

NOW AND THEN-ON
THE FIGHTING LINE
(By J. A. Rose.)
As a soldier of the civil war I have
been somewhat interested in the ac
counts of and management of the
preparations for the war at the pres
ent time, compared with the '(it and
Yi5 affair. In the first place I notice
the difference in the number of appli
cants that are rejected on account of
their physical defects. Taking it for
granted that tho examinations je
along the same line as at the time of
the . Civil war, why Is it that such a
threat percentage fail to pass the ex-ami-iations
at the present time and so
fey were disqualified in '61? In this
particular the young men of the pres
ei.i time seem to be retrograding hut
in the matter of convoniences and
fcrnenil improvement the credit Is all
on the other side. For instance, in the
r. i.tler of, transportation, in 'fil we
did well if we h' J stock cars, freight
cars or even flat fars to move in from
one place to another, but now, sleep
ers are the order of the day.
As to tents, each soldier was provid
ed with the half of a tent and two put
together furnished quarters for two.
Rations is the important item of tbe
soldier's fare. I noticed one item in
your paper a short time ago giving
the menu for a soldier's dinner: Roost
l.eef with brown gravy, new creamed
potatoes, jams, jellies, etc., no butter,
but will have butter for supper. The
menu for the '(il boys would be about
'his. while in the states: Light bread,
oi'tee, pickled pork, fried or boiled,
good and fat, a few beans with ple.n'y
of f;oup and rice and some black stm.)
molasses. We managed to get a little
;'.-u once in a while. After leaving
the states our menu was about as fol-
i
lows, and each one did his own cook
;ny: Coffee, sugar, hard tack, pickled
I'lrif. That would include our bill of
tare, when we were on the move.
Our sugar and coffee was dealt ot t
to us but we could help ourselves o
tli? pickled pork and hard tat-S. Pe"
s ).i;.lly, I could not make coffee to s: it
me so took my sugar Riid spread it on
my bard tack as long as the sui;ar
sted and ate it in that way, and whci
the sugar was gone I would cut slices
of the pork thin and eat it on the hum
tack, which tasted good to me then
but I could not eat fat meat, before I
went into the army and would not rel
ish it much now. B.ut I got fat on my
soldier diet. When we were able to
camp at one place for a few days we
would fare a little better. ' We would
sometimes have beef, we called it
"mule beef" whether it was any part
of a mule or not I don't know, but it
was rather .peculiar- looking meat,
stringy, course and rather red in color,
but we had no scruples about eating

NEW INVENTIONS OF SECOND YEAR OF WAR.

French introduced aeroplanes cu.rying cannon.

Italians introduced avalanche warfaf. creating ava-

French and British invented anti-gas masks.
Germans introduced steel arrows disc barged from aero-

, - - '
M.. to (itit'r:il PersluiLrs elocdition In
it just tho same.
Potatoes: We never drew any pota
toes only as we drew them by th ou
and baked them In the coals of our
camp fire. One of our favorite dishes,
which we called slum gullioii, wu a
treat when we had time to prepare It
and was prepared by soaking our hard
tack in water over night after break
ing in pieces with a rock or some oth
er hard substance. Old time hard
tack would remain in water a week or
so without becoming soft unless it was
cracked into small bits. After frying
our meat In a frying pun or a half of
a canteen we would leave this grease
in the pan, add a little water and the
hard tack and cook it for half an hour
or so and it. would swell to three or
four times Us original size ahd then
we would have a fine meal. -
I am not trying to cast any reflec
tion on the soldier or on Uncle Sam
but it is Interesting to note the change
for the better In the fifty years that
have passed. The Improvements', in
the soldier's fare have kept pace with
all other progress and the soldiers of
today are entitled to all the considera
tion they will receive from the govern
ment or the people generally. It. is not
necessary to make any comparison re
garding the extra . company that wa
sometimes carried in our clothes as I
suppose they will bo present In the
same form and with the same activity
If given the same opportunity and
probably no improvement along this
line. , ;

ho married a daughter of the sugar
king, Havemeyer, never Interfered
with his service. He did a lot of work.

Baltluslilp New Hampshire right up

ommended for "extraordinary hero
Ism." AVInslow and his men went out In
sail and motor launches. Winslow
was in charge. With the big guns on
the ships out in the harbor firing at
the cable office they wrecked it bo
fore Winslow reached shore Winslow
went Into the face of a Spanish bom
bardment. He got by with it in ex
cellent, shape some casualties report
ed, but the work done.
Admiral Winslow has done a lot of
sea duty. He has done some land du
ty, too enough to bo known to New
Yorkers for his stay as supervisor
New York harbor in 1909, 1910 and
1911, and to those at Newport, R. I.,
when he was at the naval war college
in iftO-l.
At the time of his retirement Wins
low was a full admiral, being entitled
to that rank by virtue of his command
of the Pacific fleet. He served as a
member of the Sloeum commission
when the burning of the New York
excursion ateamer was investigated.
Winslow wag born In Washington
In lS5t. He was appointed to the na
val academy by the president in 1 S 70,
and graduated In 187.1).
