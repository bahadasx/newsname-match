OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
Under a heading. "A Compari
son." the St. Louis Mirror has the
following:
"The opposition to WoodroW
Wilson is making the same kind
of I light that was made on Lin
coln when he stood for the second
tend, Lincoln was accused of
vacillation, procrastination, tem
porization, pusillanimity, phrase
making, playing politics. Now all
these things have blended into
what the panegyrists call 'his
sublime patience.' Woodrow Wil
son may not be a Lincoln, but he
has been patient. His patience
won his point with Germany, His
patience has kept us out of war.
On the war issue the opposition
has simply nothing to oppose t>
Woodrow Wilson. Would Mr.
Hughes have had less patience or
more with Germany, with Mexico?
On either horn he must impale him
self. There is no escape by a mid
dle way."
The opposing issue when Air.
Lincoln was last nominated was to
gain by the ballot what the ene
mies of the North had practically
lost on the fields of battle. The
issue now opposing Wilson is the
attempt to regain by the ballot
what the special interests and the
munitions makers have lost by the
wholesome actions of our presi
dent. The "vacillation" of Wil
son has kept us from war, but it
has likewise kept several special
interests from increasing their for
tunes at the expense of the life
blood of our youth. Therefore,
Hughes, indorsed by these in
terests, should be elected to take
the place of Wilson in order that
this same Hughes may "Ameri
canize" our people in teaching
them how to fight whenever the
munitions makers are ready for
further yiroftts.
To stimulate the growth of the
industries of the state of Washing
ton, to create a condition of in
dustrial preparedness which shall
place its manufacturers on a sub
stantial and lasting basis, and to
advocate the use of Washington
made products by the people who
reside within this commonwealth,
the manufacturers of this state
have planned to carry out a big
campaign of advertising and pub
licity during the years of 1916
and 1917.
The movement for encouraging
the use of made-in-Washington
goods first originated with the
manufacturers who have their
plants on Puget Sound.The manu
facturers of Washington realize
that, with the wider publicity
given to eastern made products,
the growth of their concerns has
been hampered and people are un
wittingly led to believe that such
products are preferable to Wash
ington goods.
It is to establish in the minds of
Washington people the fact that
the factories of this state make
just as good products and sell
■m as reasonably as foreign con
cerns, that the present campaign
. us planned.
The Manufacturers' Association
also appreciates the vital part the
press of the state can and does
perform in the spreading of news
and advertising regarding any
products and has determined thut
it will use liberal space in these
publications.
Individual manufacturers are
entering heartily into the newly
formed plan and have already
signed contracts to take space in
scores of the newspapers of the
state. Indications at present arc
that not only the industries, but
the people of the Htate as well,
will profit vantly from this cam
paign. The Colville Examiner has
been selected as one of the papers
which will advertise made-in-
Washington foods, and on the
theory that money spent at. home
is money well spent, this paper
will continue to encourage baying
home goods at horn*.
FILINGS FOR OFFICE.
The tilings for office under the
primary law are proceeding slow
ly, imt nil of the tickets being
fitted. No progressive ticket has
yet appeared, the republicans hav
ing succeeded in strangling them
in the county.
Three tilings have been made
for judge—l). H. Carey, J. A.
Bochford, F. Leo Orinstead. J.
A. Roehford, one of the oldest
practitioners in the county, who
has served as prosecuting attor
ney and who was a candidate four
years ago, is making a strong
campaign. Judge Carey was for
several years judge of this dis
trict, but retired from the bench
four years ago to resume the prac
tice of law. lie is considered 11
strong candidate. P. Leo Grin
stend, \vlio campaigned through
the primary and then withdrew
from the judgeship race four years
ago in favor of Judge, Jackson, is
again in the race, but not with
the support which he had before,
The lielief still seems to rankle in
the minds of some of his former
supporters that his former with
drawal was in the nature of a
political or business deal, although
others claim that it was simply
good politics and that the Jack
son support will this time be
turned to him in return for his
withdrawal. However, the local
paper which was supposed to form
the liasis of support for Grinstead
has mine nut with the advice that
Carey's record as judge was good,
hene>' the inside workings of the
judfgeship fight this year may be as
obscure as were they four years
ago, and it may be that Grinstead
is apaiii to be eliminated.
Tin- republican county ticket
shovs the hand of the old local
ring, although sonic new blood has
b«>rti put in to take off the curso.
In the lead on the ticket are two
of the old political offenders, the
i-andidates for sheriff and prose
riiting attorney, who are reaching
out for the fourth time to grasp
hold of the county pay rope. A
Si evens county ballot would sure
look strange without the redoubt
able names of -Miller and Stull.
Some parts of the ticket are said
to be unsatisfactory to the leader
ship of the party, but when ques
tion is made as to who compose
this leadership, the Examiner
does not get any very clear ans-
..er, hence we judge that the
weakness of the candidates must
be a touchy matter.
The democrats seem to be tak
ing their time in filing, although
ilii-re are plenty of names men
tioned for filings. Democrats
liave never been the proficient or
persistent officer seekers that have
been exampled by their republi
can brethren, but somehow they
'-'■■nerally manage to find a candi
date for each place before the au
.litor locks up on the last great
day before the filings close.
The socialists long ago selected
their candidates by referendum.
In nee they have plenty of time to
walk up and spend their filing
feel in a leisurely manner, with
out fear of crowding or being
l»aten by some other member of
i Ik; party. As a methodical, com
posed und accurate politican, the
-■ >-ialist has them all beaten at the
piarter post, but of course the
tinal ballot counting is always a
sorrow.
Meanwhile, the days for regis
i. ring are fast coining to a close,
;ind unless the rural voters get out
fast beiween now and Tuesday,
i here will be a very small primary
•nte polled. The last republican
stutfl legislature decided thai to"
many farmers were voting in this
late, and the present, law is a
■ suit. From present appearances.
the legislators knew the habits of
the farmers, and will have them
pretty well shut out of the pri
mary election. Even townspeople

The supreme lodge of the
Knights of Pythias, and the su
preme temple Pythian Sisters, will
convene in biennial session at
Portland Aug. 1-10. The pro
gram includes a trip over the fa
mous Columbia river highway, a
trip through the Columbia gorge
by boat, a salmon dinner out of
doors, a clam bake on the ocean
beach, the supreme chancellor's
ball, a night at the Oaks with
pyrotechnic display, a council
lire on Council Crest, one of the
greatest fraternal parades ever
made by one fraternity on the
Pacific coast, two picnic recep
tions, surf bathing at the beach,
and two auto trips through the
most magnificent scenery in Amer
ica. Portland is sparing no ex
pense in an endeavor to make this
meeting the most memorable ses
sion in the history of the order.
On the night of Aug. 2 Walter B.
Ritchie of Lima, Ohio, past su
preme chancellor, will deliver his
famous address on "friendship."
It is said that this address is one
of the masterpieces of the Eng
lish language, and that no man
has ever yet listened to it without
having stirred within his breast
all the nobler qualities of his soul.
Reduced rates will be in effect on
all railroads. It is expected that
25,000 knights will attend the
convention.
Xearly 700,000 acres of unap
propriated and unsurveyed land
in this state, including railroad
granted and lieu lands that have
been kept off the state tax rolls
by railroad and timber companies
holding scrip, will all have been
made to contribute toward sup
port of the government by this
fall if good weather holds out.
From his headquarters in Olympia,
E. A. Fitzhenry, surveyor general,
has already sent 12 surveying
puriies out into the public domain
this year and will have 15 parties
of nine men each at work next
month. As rapidly as the land is
surveyed it is segragated and be
comes assessable for taxation pur
poses. Governor Lister took up
the matter of having these sur
veys made soon after assuming oi'
ftce in 1913, working direct with
federal land authorities at Wash
ington, I). ('., particularly with
reference to railroad granted and
lieu lands. With the cooperation
of the surveyor general he suc
ceeded to such an extent that 14
parties were sent into the field in
this state, where only six had been
permitted in previous years. This
was increased to 17 parties in 1915,
with the result that comparatively
a small portion remained unclassi
fied i'or 1916, and the department
is making every effort to complete
the surveying of these tracts this
year. The net result for three
years is the addition of 600,000
acres to the tax rolls. Most of
the land is in Yakima, Kittitas,
Okanogan and I'end Oreille coun
ties.
Some one a few days ago said:
"How can you expect the fanners
to get along and be thrifty when
they sell what they raise for three
fourtha of its value, and buy what
they need and pay twice what it
is worth?" This put* up a prob
lem worth considering and the
only cure is to raise a crop that
can be fed on the farm and sold
on the hoof and not sacrificed as
«oon aa harvested, at the cutthroat
prices that usually prevail when
everybody wants to sell at the
same time. (Jranaries, storehouses
and better facilities for keeping
farm products must be a part of
the solution, and then there will
not he much need for buying
things back from the local stores.
