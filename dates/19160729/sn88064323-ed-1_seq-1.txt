SUGAR NEWS.
If the 191G cane crop of every
sugar parish in Louisiana «hows
the same rate of increase over the
1915 cane crop as the Pariah of
St. Mary doea, a 300,000 ton sugar
crop in Louiaiana in 1910 would be
an abaointe certainty and a low
figure at that. Practically every
place in St. Mary expecta to grind
two or three or four timea what
they ground laat year and the crop
ia in such apleudid shape from the
frequent raina of this week aa to
make it almoat aure that their ex
pectationa will be realized. Ster
ling refinery, whioli it ia reported
ia now own« d entirely by F. B
Williams, the GodchauxN having
diapoaed of their iutereata in it,
will grow and have contracted for
something like 200 000 tona for
their coming griudiug. It ia not
thought that they can handle all
of tbia cane at their factory with
the dispatch deemed neceaaary to
have the grinding oompleted be
fore the firat bad freeze. They
will, moat likely, aell some of it
when they fiud out they cannot
handle it themaelvea and perhaps
profit handsomely because sugar
prices then will be very
high and cane prices, consequent
ly, likewise high. Marylaud, owu
ed by M'a A. M Clausen, At, Fos
ter, La , in St. Mary Pariab, will
surely double, at least, its 1915
production, and the same report ia
had from the Franklin refiuery,
which granulates the syrup fiom
Maryland, Viloy and Yokely
The Johnson factory of the O. D.
Berwick Pltg. & Mfg. Co, ex
pects a 10,000 or 12 000 ton crop
this fall, all of which will, aa
usual, be made up into tine white
consumable sugar. They have
leased the Garret plantation of N
K Todd, near Bayou Sale, and
put it in charge of one of the most
experienced cane men in that Bee
lion Tbia place had become run
down of late years aa a caue pro
ducer, but one of the beat crops
ever raised in that aection is uow
growing «on it. The Germania
plantation of Mnreira, Heb wan
and Moreira. will grind about
8.000 tous this year where it only
ground 1,400 tona in 1915
Sbadyside expects a 65,000 ton
cane crop this year. Last year
Sbadyside ground only 17,452
tons Alice C factory, owned by
J. W. Foster and located neai
Franklin, expects to grind from
25.000 to 30,000 tona this fall aa
compared Billeaud with a grind
ing of only 10,500 tons in 1915
The Bi.leaud factory, at Bious
sard, La., expects a crop at least
twice that of 1915 and that crop
today is further advanced, for
this time, than any ot the Billeaud
crops for many years
Fear of a freeze, that being the
only thing that can now prevent
the sugar planters of this section
from having the best* year in its
history, has created , an anxiety
to start grinding as soon aa they
can atart and in Sr. Mary Parish
the grinding is expected be well
under way by October 25th.—Lon

TO DEVELOP 6RAN0
ISLE COUNTRY.
For the first time it! its history
the remarkably rich country south
of New Orleans, along thô lower
coast and over toward Grand Isle,
will feel the touch of concerted
and concentrated development at
the hands of a syndicate of well
known New Orleans capitalists who,
having acquired the Grand Isle
Railroad reaching from New Or
leans into that district, arc pre
S ared to spend adequate sums to
evelop the big commercial pos
sibilities which heretofore have had
no attention Of this character. The
members of the syndicate are Hugh
McCloskey, President of the Amer
ican Cities Co. and Director of the
Hibernia Bank ; Bernard McClos
key, Attorney; Frank B. Hayne, Di
rector of the Hibernia Bank, mer
chant and capitalist; C. E. Allgeyei
C, P. Ellis and T. G. Bush, ail cotton
merchants and men of means; Wal
ter G. Weiss, (»encras Dufour, Le»
Benoist and Hugh Vincent Har
rison D Emerson is General Man
ager of the properties which, un
der his administration, have .al
ready begun to show an increase
in earnings.
The purpose of the syndicat«*
to devote its present attention to
the purely commercial and indus
trial side of developing traffic for
the railroad and extending the lat
ter by rail and by boat into the
hitherto neglected field. This
the. great orange or citrous fruit
belt of La., ana i| known as tin
richest land in the Unite»! States,
particularly tor vegetables and
fruit, while the development of thi
oyster, shrimp, crab, fish and ter
rapin industries will be given a big
impetus by reason of quick hand
ling and immediate deliveries to
the New Orleans market and* tin
rapid transit thence to the north
ern markets.
The promotion of Grand Isle,
with its nine Tuile beach, as a sum
mer and winter resort, while not
a matter of immediate intention, is
included in the scheme of futur«
development.
When the bowels feel uncomfort
able and you miss the exhilarating
feeling that always follows a co
pious morning operation, a dose
of HERBINB will set you right -in
a couple of hours. If taken at bed
time you get ita beneficial effect

SAYS CATTLE DIPPING
ORDINANCE IS VOID.
Judge Simon Quashes Many
Indictments Against Al
leged Iberia Violators.
Nfw Iberia, La., July 24.— a
decision which will aeriotialy at
feet stock men in Iberia paiisb
wan handed down by Judge James
Simon in the District Court here
this afternoon. The authority un
der which Dr. Brand, government
I inspector, aud his assistants have
of j attempted to enforce cattle dip
the'ping during 1915 and this year
of i emanated from the parish police
jury which in fixing tin* penalty
for non dipping made the maxi.
to
mum tine *500 Working under
this ordinance ihe parish inspect
ora filed some 250 affidavits
against non dippers, of which tin
present grand jury returned 135
indictments. Last week Home
I twenty cattlemeu pleaded guilty,
werefined *10 l*y the court and
sente.ee was suspended The
j balance of those indicted, some
100 in number, pleaded not guilty
and employed Emile Vuillemot as
counsel.
On opening of court this morn,
mg Attorney Vuillemot filed
motiou to quash the Indictments
on the ground that the police jury,
in fixing a penalty in excess of
that fixed by the state law, ex
ceeded its authority, and try that
act the ordinance was null and
void and of no effect. Argu
ments ou the motion by District
Attorney Broussard and Attorney
Vuillemot continued until 3 p. m.
At 4 p. m Judge Simon, after cit
ing numerous decisions, sustained
plaintiff's motiou, thus declaring
I liât the ordinance of the police
jury compelling the dipping of
cattle void and of no effect.
Following consultations held
after adjournment of court, Dr.
Braiid, iu whose charge the dip
ping work has gone forward, stat
ed that he would at once comtnu
nicate with the State Live stock
Sanitary Boaid and request of
them, under the law which is now
in effect to designate I Irena as one
ot the parishes iu which the law
will become effective at once.
It is felt here that the stoppage
of the work just at this time in
the parish will operate strongly
against the parish and strong rep
resentations will go forward to the
state board to act at once so tha>
I he stoppage of the work will be h
short duration.

BROUSSARD WOULD
END DRAWBACKS TO
AID SU6ARJNDUSTRY.
Tells Senate of $20,000,000
Paid Out, 88 Per Cent Is
for Cane Product.
By Paul Wooton.
Washington, July—Of the
$20,000,000 of customs drawbacks
which probably will be paid in
1916 not more than *1,500,000
will be repaid to exporteis of other
products than those containing
sugar.. This fact was brought out
by Beuator Broussard when he ap.
peared today before the Senate
finance committee urging the aboi
ishment of drawbacks during the
continuance of the war. As eigfi.
ty-eight per cent of drawbacks
are paid on account of sngar, the
abolition of this privilege would
act as an important aid to the
domestic sogar industry. It also
would add the *20,090,000 to tbe
federal income.
Senator Broussard recommend
ed that this form of taxation take
the place of proposed taxes on
banks, amusements and a certain
class of alcoholic beverages.
Since these items wonld raise $10,
000,000 Senator Broussard sug
gested that other items be selected
for elinntation to make ap tbe
$20,000,000 which would be saved.
Members of the committee ask
ed many questions and showed a
decided interest in the proposal
which they characterized as nniqne
and interesting.—Times.Picayuue
