'y cutting ft off in strips. Instruc- I
tions were given to ask Commis- 4

SThe Neuhauser Brothers of Slidell
A. S. N uhadser U. G. NeThauser
A COMPANY THAT IS BUILDING' A
BIG BUSINESS, KEEPING MONEY
HOME, HELPING HOME LABOR
Nehauser Brothers Ltd. is a firm
that is becoming known as a sub
stancial, -reliable business concern.
Not known simply as a supply house
for the home and farm, vut inti
mately known and trusted in the
households of this and adjoining
-parishes, a confidence that has been
won by truthful representation and
fair dealing during the eleven years
of their establishment in business
in Slidell, La., in '1905, in which time
they have built up a business cover
ing a radius of 100 miles, using as
their motto, 'tEvery deal a square
deal," and adopting the. business
principle of carrying out the senti
ment of their motto. It has paid
'them, and you could not get them t
adopt any other.
The Neuhausers were originally
from Pennsylvania, moving to Ten
nessee ini 1871, where they were ed
ucated in the public schools. The,
were reared on a farm, drawing froni
their rugged life the charaxteristic'
that have made them -successful
business men.
At 21 years of age U. G. Neuhause
left the farm and entered railroac'
employment- becoming a telegraph
operator and agent for some of th
big roads, and subsequently comin'
'to Slidell as agent for the New Or
leans and Northeastern and the New
Orleans Great Northern. He waS
appointed postmaster of Slidell i'
1912, but gave up this position in
11.914. in order to give his entir
attention to his rapidly growing
business.
A. S. Neuhauselt was also with the
Northeastern 'Railroad Company, an'
afterwards was manager of the OCpm.
missary of the Slidell Brick Works
In 1905 he and U. G. Neuhauser
started their present business wit',
a stook of goods invoicing about
1$11200.00, 'in a room covering abou'
2.400 square feet of floor space. Th'
average Cost of merchandise now, car
ried is $37,000.00, requiring a floc
space -of .15,000 square feet, beside -
the warehouses. A. S. Neuhauser.
To Voters of the 26th JudicialDistri
Dear Sirs and Friends:
Owing to certain false uumors that
are being circulated, I take th4
means in laying out my cause before
you, in-order that you may not be
misled by the effect of statemnts
when it becomes necemsary for you
toerOnsider my esaud· y ~ t. he
who is now President of the company
took charge of the business from the
start, Mr. U. G. Neuhauser, now vice
president, continuing his employ
ment with the railroad company and
as postmaster until, 1914.
This company now employs
eighteen men and three ladies, and
the policy of the company has been
such as to w'n the good will of em
ployees, making them ail workel.
for the upbuilding of the 'buainess.
All have aided in the progress of the.
company. J. A. Mire, secretary
started with the company soon after
its beginning. L. H. Vigier, one of
the buyers, has been with the compa
ny more than six years. The fresh
meat department is in charge of L
N. Yoder, who is winnllng popularity
for service.
Probably the most important
thing in the Neuhauser business is
the establishment of the nail order
department. Forty thousand dollarr
have been going out of this parisl
every year to foreign concerns 'for
clothing, implements and householk
goods. It-is a hard matter to con
vince people that the spending of
this money away from home is an
injury to this section, because eaci
figures only on the amount that i
spent individually and not the col
lective amount. Each figures that
his or her little purchase will no'
make any difference. The only way
to keep this money at home is to
convince the purchaser that article,
may be bought just as cheaply a
home and of just as good quality
Therefore the policy . Neuhause,
Brothers of giving value for the
money and guarantee of quality har
brought personal interest of the pur
chaser to their support. It *bringf
to the door of the purchaser the
opportunitiesin buying that have
heretofore appealed to him in the
offerings of mail order houses hun
dreds of miles away, keeping money'
at home and giving la#or to homt
employees, with Opportunity to In
spect goods, if desired.
It has been said that whilst I hold'
one office, that I am now seekilnl
another. This is not so, I have req
signed, and am no longer' represent
