BUILT THROUGH HAYS.
FORT HAYS NORMAL WILL EE
GREATLY BENEFITED BY COM
PLETION OF NORTH AND
SOUTH RAILROAD.
Expected to be in Use September 1917.
(BY P. (JASPAR HARVEY)
Hays is to have'a new railroad.
The Anthony and Northern Railroad
which is being now bailt northward in
Kansas from Pratt, has as its next ob
jective, Hays. It is now running into
Lamed in Pawnee County, and Kinsley
-l j "- r. - i
A railroad crossing the main and
branch lines of all of the railroads run
ning through central and western Kan
sas will open up a cross Kansas line in
the veryjheart of its best wheat belt.
This will give to central Kansas, Gulf
and Oklahoma connections.
What particularly interests Hays is
the fact that this new railroad will open
up a territory for the Fort Ha3'3 Kan
sas Normal School which it now has
in spirit, but which it can not actually
get because of the poor railroad con
nections. This territory comprises
twenty-eight counties. . These counties
will be made nearer to the Fort Hays
Kansas Normal School than to any
other State Educational Institution
and nearer to it than many of the de
nominational colleges. Thi3 railroad
will be in operation, according to Pres-
ident Byers of the Railroad Company
and President Lewi3 of the Normal
School, so that students who start n
September 1917, will have its accommo
dations. This railroad now crosses four lines:
the southern division of the Santa Fe,
the southern division of the Rock Is
land, the Kinsley branch of the Santa
Fe at Belpre, and the main branch of
the Santa Fe at Larned. When it
reaches Hays in August 1917, it will
cross in addition to these the Scott City
branch of the Santa Fe at Rush Center,
the main line of the Missouri Pacific at
LaCrosse, and the main line of the
Union Pacific at Hays. The next ob
jective point after Hays which Pres
ident Byers has in mind, is Hastings,
Nebr., and it will give a cross cut to all
of the railroad lines in Kansas north of
Hays.
The active campaign in Ellis county
and Hays is now going forward for the
bonds. . Petitions are being circulated
to call an election to vote these bonds.
Big Creek Township will vote on $75,
OOD in bonds; Lookout Township .will
vote on either $75,000 or" $78,000 in
bonds; and the city of Hays will vote
on $20,000 terminal aid bonds. The
City of Hays can not vote a larger bond
issue because the law does not permit
it. There seems to be no opposition
whatever to the voting of these bonds
and a number of individuals who are
expected to either oppose or be luke
warm toward them, have gotten out
with the petitions to circulate them
themselves.
By November 1, 1916, it is stated that
the railroad will have" reached the
northern line of Pawnee County. The
policy of President Byers in building
this railroad, has been to ask no bonus
es and to build it as it pays for itself.
NEW ROAD AMBITIOUS.
Anthony and Northern Plans Exten
sion to Nebraska.
Topeka, July 25 The Anthony &
Northern railroad company of Hutch
inson has filed an application with the
public utilities commission asking per
mission to issue $1,850,000 in preferred
and common stock bringing the whole
amount up to $3,000,000. The stoek
will be used in extending the railroad
the company is now building, which

when completed will extend from An-
thony, through Barber, Pratt, Stafford,
Pawnee, Rush, .Ellis,, Rooks and
Phillips counties to Hastings, Neb., a
distance of approximately 275 miles.
Arrangements have been made, the
application states, witn the Pratt con
struction company whereby that com
pany is to receive preferred and com
mon stock each to the value of $10,000
for every mile of completed track.
The Anthony & Northern was incor
porated December 12, 1912, with a
capital stock of S1DO,000, Once since
its capital stock has been increased
$1,000,000. The application now on file
j in the office of the public utilities com-
I mission is for the second increase.

Civic League Notes.
The union services held in the court
yard lawn the past few Sunday even
ings, have been well attended. The
excellent music furnished by the Fort
Hays Normal orchestra was in itself
uplifting and inspiring. The singirg
and sermons were good. Many west
ern towns have tried those open air
services and find them a success. A
class is thus reached that scarcely ever
go to any church.
It is rather remarkable to notice the
effect of music Sunday evening, the
streets were filled with listless loiterers,
crowds of men back from the harvest
field lined the curbings, and were gath
ered in groups and bunches on the street
corners. With the first few strains of
music from the orchestra' in the Band
j stan(j tney began to move toward tl
Court yard. In a very short time the
streets were almost cleared.
Many cities in Kans.is have an ordi
nance forbidding the repairing of such
buildings as caught fire on Chestnut
street this week, it woald have boen
better if it had bean totally destroyed.
Everyone who has had an occasion to
get out on the street, and the business
men along the principal street in par
ticular, , are surely grateful to those
who are reponsible for the sprinkling
of Chestnut street. The task of hand
ling those heavy hose is by no means
an easy one but it su'rely did the work
of keeping down the dust. We still
have hopes that some means will be
devised to continue this good work.
Every improvement pays a dividend.
Ask Geo. Grass and A. A. Wiesner if
their vef rigerators have not paid f ci
themselves not alone in preserving
perishable stuff but m in attracting
customers to purchase, and too, cus
tomers like to trade with the modem
progressive-merchant..
There are stores everywhere in the
state that continue to keep fruit anc"
other eatables evposed to flies and
germ laden dust despite the fact that
( ivansas nas a law lorbidding sucn.
1 There is no argument or excuse for the
( violation of law, and no one will deny
. but that this law is an excellent ona
and should be enforced.

Barn Burned.
Last We dnesdoy night, Louis Kraus'
large stone barn and contents were de
stroyed by fire. Besides a large quan
tity of grain, three mule3, one horse, a
Ford automobile, a wagon or two, and
several farm implements were de
stroyed. We have been unable to get
the particulars, but understand the
loss amounted to several thousand dol
lars, with but little insurance. Mr.
Ks.' barn was one of the most complete
and best appointed barns in western
Kansas. It is a mystery how the build
ing caught fire as it was considered
almost fire proof. It is supposed it
was from an incendiary origan. It was
a great loss.

The United States Census Statistics
CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING FIGURES
These figures show that sixty-sir, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the Onited States have ab
solutelv no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twenty-five
die with less than $1300, and only nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses
or fiction, they are the facts, arrived at by the U.
