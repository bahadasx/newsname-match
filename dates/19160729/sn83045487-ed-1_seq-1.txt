Publicity Managers Already on the Job
Shaping "Public Opinion" j
The army of organized railroad
trainmen and enginemen of Chicago
will get battered forty ways by the
big daily papers of Chicago next
week when the vote of the big broth
erhoods is announced Aug. 5, if it
looks like a strike.
A Bureau of Railway Publicity has
been feeding good cash money to the
trust press some weeks now. A ring
of bankers, manufacturers and mer
chants is ready for a campaign inside
all the big business organizations to
line up what is called "public opin
ion" with the railroads and against
the railroad workers.
"Wreckers," "anarchists," "diabol
ical enemies of public welfare," and
so on, are some of the old pet names
of the trust press expected if the
brotherhood officials announce they
don't see any other way than a tie
up, a direct tryout of physical force
tactics, to win their demands for an
eight-hour day.
