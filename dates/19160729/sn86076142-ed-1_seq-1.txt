PAK1S. July 29. "The Becond year
of the war ends with anxiety shifting
from the group of the entente powere
to that of our adversaries who are
bow obliged to meet a general com
toed offensive on every front," said
Karquls de Chambrun, h member of
the foreign affairs committee of the
Chamber of Deputies, in summarizing
the military situation for the Asso
ciated Press at the close of the wax's
second year.
"While French, British and Russian
preparations become more complete,
t crisis of exhaustion Is fait arising
for the Austiians and Qerruaus. Our
adversaries thought It would be im
possible for us to prepare, and cer
tainly during the flrst year of the war

overcome. We are proud to say that
rtis was accomplished even while our
valiant soldiers were , resisting the

work successfully on the eastern
front. They have again Invaded Bu

the region of Lutsk and into the Car

A wire received this morning from

compelled to live on the coast to
avoid the tense altitude of Nevada.

Rescue-Eula is In better physical
condition today than at any time
since the discovery of the ore lens
that created a sensation a few
months ago. This fact is established
by a visit to the property, where sev
eral hours were spent in close Inspec
tion. The workings in ore in the
property consist of an east and west
drift from the point of Intersection by
means of a crosscut run north from
a drift extended easterly from the
shaft on the 950 level. This drift
was run only about twenty feet from
the intersection point west' in the Eula
claim, because the value lessened,
besides the east end line of the Occi
dental claim of the Belmont was
about reached. A raise, known as
the No. 3, was put up at this point
and connection made with the Bel
mont workings, affording an excellent
circulation of air and relieving- the
intense heat which previously pre
vailed. The drift was extended easterly 200
feet, making slight curvatures to keep
both walls of the vein in sight. At
no point did the vein pinch, or lose Its
values, although at one or two places
it narrowed for a short distance and
had several comparatively lean places,
although practically no waste was
taken from this working, the only dis
carded rock coming from the winze.
Raises Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6 are east
of the point of intersection and all
are in ore their entire height. No. S
