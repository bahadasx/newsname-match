BERLIN. July 28. (By wireless to
I Sayville) Captain Chas. Fryatt or the
'Great Eastern Railway steamship
, Brussels, whose vessel was captured
. by German destroyers last month and
taken inf.i Zeebrugge. has been ex
ecuted by shooting after trial by a
I German naval court martial. The
death sentence was passed upon Capt.
i Fryatt because of his alleged action
in attempting previously to ram
German submarine.
LONDON. July 28. News of the ex
ecution of Captain Fryatt Of the Brit
ish steamer Brussels caused a painful
impression at the British foreign of
fice. I'nder the instructions of Vis
count Grey, the foreign secretary, a
note was despatched immediately to
the American embassy requesting
that James M. Gerard, the American
ambassador at Berlin, procure com
plete details of the affair. The first
intimation llf the trial of Captain Fry
att was called to the attention of the
foreign office by press reports on July
18 to the effect that he was to be
tried as the result of finding on him
a watch containing an inscription re
citing his efforts to ram a German
submarine.
Convicted By Press,
j From inquiries made of the owners
of the steamship Wrexham, which
Captain Fryatt Commanded when the
alleged incident took place, the for
eign office learned the captain had
with him neither a watch nor a let
ter to the effect that he had attempt
ed to ram a submarine when he was
captured. Therefore, officials here
state, the charge must have been
based on press reports.
U. S. Agent Attended Trial.
When the news that Captain Fryatt
was to be tried was received, the
foreign office immediately sent a note
to the American ambassador. Walter
S. Page, requesting that American
diplomatic representatives take all
necessary steps to provide for his de
fense, calling attention to the fact
that the Wrexham's act in steering
toward the submarine and forcing
her to dive was essentially defensive
and precisely the same as if she had
used the defensive armament which
the I'nited States and Great Britain
bold to be an undoubted right.
No reply was received from Ambas
sador Gerard, but the foreign office Is
convinced he acted with his usual
promptitude. Therefore it Is their
theorv that the trial and execution of
Captain Fryatt was hurried even more
than in the case of Miss Edith Cavoll.
Indignation Rampant.
Besides the original inquiry, the
foreign office sent to other notes on
the subject to Ambassador Gerard.
According to wireless messages
from Germany. Captain Fryatt was ex
ecuted "lor franc-tireur crime against
armed German sea forces "
Officers of the admiralty were ar
oused to intense indignation when
they learned of the affair.
