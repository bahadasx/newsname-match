The tobacco situation In eastern

crop has been greatly Injured, but to
what extent the warehousemen would

K. W. Dabbs Soys That

Sterns. !
Salem, Black River. July
pen as, where tne rahi. fill of *
great storm of July U wag net
gentleman estimated corn damaged II
per cent., cotton 10 per cent, .'around
Sumter. From what I have since
learned, the rain fall around Sumter
could not have been eleven. < 11) inches
from Thursday noon to Saturday noon,
as it was here. If It had been, 1 dare
say crops would have shown it more
than 10 or 16 per cent. And I am
I pure the roads and bridges In that ee?*>
^tion would have been damaged even
more than In the eastern part of the
[county, Instead of scarcely at all, as
reported by Mr. Pitts.
On top of the storm, and . just as
we were hoping to help cotton by
Starting the plows it began to rale
last Thursday and has rained every
I day since, six days of soggy, pene?
trating drtssles, several times hard
rains. This morning cotton looks
worse than It did Immediately after
the storm.
I have seen a good deal of the crops
from Mayesville to 8hlloh and have
talked with some of the best farmers.
Taken as a whole the damage to both
.corn and cotton Is 60 per cent, and
[may be more. Any talk of 5 to 10
per cent, as I see a Florence corre?
spondent says the cotton buyers of
that section have reported to their
houses, shows either gross ignorance
of the nature of the cotton plant, or a
[wilful misrepresentation of the facts.
Without any wind, a fall of eleven
to fourteen Inches of rain in forty
eight hours, as is reported from those
sections by the official weather ob
I servers, will damage cotton more than
6 or 10 per cent. If crops always
deceive In a dry year, the converse I
true?that crops always disappoint in
a wet year. Tobacco In damaged from
76 to 100 per cent. It Is pitiable to
look at some tobacco fields in the Shi
loh section.

CROP DAMAGE AT DALZELL.
Impossible Yet to Estimate the Does
to Farmers Says J. C. Dunbar.
Dalsen, July 26.?It Is now several
days since the storm struck us, but
we are-not able to say to what extent
-the crops are damaged. WJlere the
corn was pretty wall advagiggd, p%%
does not seem to be hurt so much,
but where it was in a n mi li.WpshdJf'
silking and tasselUng. It is Brfl?
give any Intslllgent estimate of lit
damage. The bloom having been
washed off and the fodder split In^O
shreds, it is sore to dwarf more or leas,
and what we have seen does not look
very promising. The Wind was 8b apf
vere that the corn was blown in most
every direction and the roots were
broken and torn to a considerable ex?
tent, but that trouble wc think hag
been remedied a great deal by the
continuous rains since. As to what
the corn crop will be In the end, ig
a problem we can not yet work out.
The writer has seen several tropical
storms In the past and some of those
very bad, but does not remember ever,
seeing such a one as we had the
other day/ just at the time the crope
were at their best. I dare eay there
are many others who can give the
same version, consequently with that
experience, we can not Intelligently
estimate the loss.
The cotton crop will be short with
us this time, we may be sure. A great
deal of it was very late, owing to the
dry spring, it having been so dry the
seed could not germinate in the soil.
The rains the first of this month had
jjst got It Into a good way of growing
when the storm struck it and of
course set It back for several days.
Now, at the very time it should be re?
covering, we are having continuous*
rains, which are thoroughly soaking
and drenching the lands whereby the
fertilisers are leaching and the crops
will be left with not sufficient food to
nourish It through to the end of the
season.
I Some of us ar; somewhat troubled
j with that one specific crop that al?
ways flourishes In wet weather. The
prospect for hay Is much brighter
than that for cotton.
