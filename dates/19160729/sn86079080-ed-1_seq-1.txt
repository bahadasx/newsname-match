shown to be contagious until 1909. It has been proven that the germ

Acknowledgment.
It was ye editor's gook luck to be
presented with a fine "water.
mnelon" during the week, and it
is not only a joy but also a most
pleasant duty to acknowledge
this compliment through this
medium.
The generous and most highly
appreciated gift being made to
the editor by Mr. Antoine Hay
del, a staunch friend of ours,
a distinguished planter, and an
esteemed citizen of the First
Ward of this parish.
The watermelon tendered us
by Mr. Haydel was an extra
large one measuring fully 16
inches across, 30 inches in length
and'tipping the scale at 65 lbs.
Mr. Haydel's rich gift was re
lished by the editor and his fami
ly and we have no words at our
command by which we could
fittingly show our heartfelt ap
pr1ciation to our friend "An
tohe" fr.r his ever kind remem
brance and rich treat.
Perhaps the best and simpliest
way to show our appreciation at
this time is by that little word
'Thanks' said with a most sincere
andgratefui heart.

umn of this and previous issues

plicants for teachers' certificates
