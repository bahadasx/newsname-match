NOGALES BRIEFS.
Local and Personal Items Gathered
During the Week.
Tom Gittins, son of Judge
Watt Gittins, is here from the
mines for a visit with his family.
Tom is a first-class practical
miner; also a way up miiiman.
Mrs. Raymond Smith arrived
from Tucson last Sunday to
again make her home in Noga
les, the best town in the state.
Mr. Smith will arrive next week.
John Yoas, One of the county's
best known cowmen, was a busi
ness visitor at the county seat
the forepart of the week, from
his ranch in the Canille country.
He reported range conditions
good .
William Cavanaugh, of the
Sonora News Co., returned the
forepart of the week from a de
lightful outing on the coast, Los
Angeles and other points of in
terest. Willie says he met many
old-time Nogales friends, in Los
Angeles.
Last Sunday Manager Ben
Evens of the Montezuma hotel,
returned from the coast where
he spent a couple of weeks with
Mrs. Evans and Master Ben.
The folks accompanied Mr. Evans
home. All report having had a
fine time by the sea.
Train Dispatcher James Gor
don of the Southern Pacific Co.,
many years a resident of Noga
les, now located at Empalme,
Sonora, has been a stopover vis
itor here several days this week
on his way back to Empalme to
resume work. Mrs. Gordon, who
also has a wide circle of old
friends here, accompanied her
husband.
Superintendent Kingsbury of
the Sonora railway, has been in
the city several days, assisting
General Superintendent H. J.
Temple in getting the company's
business lined up once more.
Tuesday morning the Sonora
military authorities turned the
road back to the Southern Pa
cific of Mexico, and rolling stock
passed across the line for the
first time in a month. Coal for
the use of the company, was the
first to cross from the American
side to Sonora.
SOME PROFIT IN COPPER.
During the first six months of
1916 Miami will have produced
approximately 23,000,000 pounds
of refined copper at a cost of
slightly less than 9c per pound,
the profits from which produc
tion calculated on 25c copper
should be nearly $1,000,000. As
compared with these earnings,
the disbursements of the two
$1.50 dividends calls for less
than $2,200,OdO or scarcely more
than half the company's net in
come. It is very apparent, there
fore, that Miami Copper is ac
cumulating an almost unwieldy
surplus account, since it is in
dicated they will have on hand
after the payment of the August
dividend in the neighborhood of
$5,000,000, which amounts to
better than $6.50 per share. On
the basis of its normal monthly
production of approximately 4,
500,000 pounds the output for
the last halt of 1015 will be in
the neighborhood of 27,000,000
pounds, which should show pro
fits of more than $4,250,000 in
even a 25c copper market, and
it is not unlikely that its entire
production has or will be sold at
a better figure.
ARIZONA FARM PRODUCT.
From the July crop report of
the United States government
we learn that Arizona's prospects
for this year are estimated as
follows: Corn, 724,000 bushels;
wheat, 1,200,000 bushels; pota
toes, 89,000 bushels. While this
is a very small per cent of the
total yield of the country it is an
indication that Arizona can be
listed as an agricultural state,
and every item shows an in
crease over last year. Consider
ing the fact that our represent
atives in congress have permitt
ed about seventy -five per cent
of the land in the state to be set
aside for Indian reservations,
forest reserves, reclamation pro
jects and mineral lands, we are
doing fairly well.

Water is 215 feet deep in the
Roosevelt reservoir, lacking 10
feet of being full. The height
of dam is 281 feet, length of top
910 feet, thickness at base 168
feet, on top 20 feet. The reser
voir when full holds 1,367,305
acre feet of water. It stores
water for 219,000 acres of land
in Salt River valley, Arizona.
Instead of complying with the
three cent fare law the Arizona
Eastern, Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe will give coupons for
excess charges, the same to be
refunded provided the federal
court does not sustain contention
of the railroads. The cases will
probably come up for trial in
Octooer or November of the pre
sent year.
During the fiscal year lately
closed, 4, 000, (XX) acres of land in
Arizona have been surveyed by
Surveyor General Trott's force
and it is expected that fully as
much more will be added to the
surveyed area during the pre
sent year. Several parties are
in the field now and it is planned
to increase the number during
the fall and winter.
The provisions of the new mi
litia law are such that most of
the soldiers will be disfranchis
ed, if kept on the border till No
vember. There is already agita
tion in New York for an emer
gency act of the Legislature to
provide a method of permitting
the soldiers to vote. Kansas
has long had such a law. Sev
eral of the Kansas county elec
tions in 1898 were decided by
the vote of the soldiers in the
Philippines. Tempe News.
EXTENDING POWER LINE.
Nogales Company Will Furnish Power
for Mines.
Sidney R. Hatch, an engineer
in the employ of the Internation
al Gas company of Nogales, with
a corps of assistants, is this
week making the preliminary
survey for the extension of the
company's transmission line for
power to the Three R. Mine,
says the Santa Cruz Patagonian.
As the plan is being worked
out by the engineers, it is the in
tention to tap the transmission
line already built from Nogales
to Duquesne at a point in the
vicinity of the Four Metals mine,
in the southern end of the coun
ty, in the Patagonia mining dis
trict, and from this point to
build the line northward to
Mowry, on to Harshaw and from
there to a point just below the
World's Fair mine, from which
place the line will turn directly
to the left and go in a straight
line westward to the Three R.
The survey is of a preliminary
nature, but it also consists dn
making final locations. '
By constructing the extension
of the power line in this manner,
it will be seen, almost every
producing mine and prospect in
the southern part of the county
will be either directly on the
line or in very close proximity.
Beginning at the Four Metals
and coming northward the next
mine of importance is the old
Mowry; then the Blue Nose,
Hermosa, Hardshell, Trench,
World's Fair, Chief, Flux and
the Three R. None of these
properties, as well as many more
not enumerated, will be more
than two miles from the power
line, while most of them will be
much nearer. The line, where
it switches westward from
the World's Fair to go to the
Three R, will be about two miles
from Red Mountain, and at its
nearest points, about four miles
from Patagonia.
The work is to be completed
and power furnished the Three
R mine within 60 days.
