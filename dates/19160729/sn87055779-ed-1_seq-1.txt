Koenig and Hilken Get Aid of

International News Service:
BALTIMORE, Md.. July 29.
Anxiety over the fate of the Ger
man super-submarine Bremen today
forced agents of the pioneer com
mercial submersible Deustchland to
make extraordinary efforts to secure
Information as to the whereabouts
of the second commercial sub
marine. Capt. Paul Koenig of the
Deutschland, and Paul Hilken. agent
oi the Deutsche Ozean-Khederei,
which owns the undersea boats,
after a lengthy conference, decided
to make an earnest effort to find
the Bremen.
The Baltimore agents determined
to get in touch with Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador,
now in New York, and seek the aid
cf (Jerman diplomacy in locating the
missing submarine, which is now a
week overdue in an American port.
The German agents here have been
hampered in their work of prepar
ing t Deutschland for her dash for
the open sea by the lack of ready
means of communication with Ger
many. The allies control of the
cables and the strict supervision of
all wireless stations by the United
States has operated to prevent Capt.
Koenig and his advisers from secur
ing definite direct information from
their superiors.
It was stated definitely today,
however, on relieble authority that
tho derision of the German agents
to hold the Deutschland at her berth
here until the Bremen is definitely
:eported as reaching an American
p rt. would stand. The Deutschland,
primed for her homeward journey,
and with everything ready for a
start seaward, at any moment, lay
ouietly at her dock today. Paul
Hilken declared emphatically today
that the Bremen was safe and that
she would be reported "in good
time."
Naal Constructor Prasse, who
superintended the building of the

country as her super cargo, contin

Gen. Carranza Agrees to Pro

Backing.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, July 2 9. Gen.
Carranza will agrci4 to the sugges
tion in the American note that the
commissions to settle the border dis
pute be given "enlarged powers."
Officials of the state department and
the de facto government of Mexico
settled this point before the note
.a.s handed to Ambassador-Designate
Arredondo last night.
Briefly Carranza's acceptance of
the American suggestion will be the
first step toward placing American
credit behind the financial resusci
tation of Mexico. No direct loan by
the American government is con
templated, however.
It is understood on high author
ity that at the successful conclu
sion of the direct negotiations pro
posed by Mexico, and accepted by
the United States financial interests
here will be informed that the
I'nited States government, "unof
ficially," will stand behind the loans.
The scope of the commissions to
be appointed by both governments
probably will Include power to sug
gest the formation of a financial
commission including one or mere
Americans with no connection with
the government, to talje over and
reconstruct Mexican finances.
After the successful conclusion of
the direct negotiations American
bankers will be informed, unolllcial
ly. that the financial intreg of the
de facto trovernment is more or less
guaranteed by the I'nited States.
Financial experts have informed
state department officials that the
surest way to restore peace and or
d'?r in Mexico would be to place
$100,000.000 in the hands of the de
i'acto government.

TEUTONS RETIRE
TOWARD WERT
Gen. Boehm-Ermollis' Army,
Driven From Brody
Moves to Busk.
International News Service:
PETROGRAD. July 20. Gen.
Boehm-Erbolli's Austro-G e r m a n
army which was driven from Prody
by the Russians, is retiring in a
westerly direction along the Iem-berg-Dubno
railway toward Husk.
Py the capture of Prody the Aus-tro-German
positions- on the Styr
river in the region of Berestetscke
are seriously menaced and a general
withdrawal of the Teutons from
that region is imminent.
Although the Austro-Hungarians
blew up warehouses, magazines and
fortified works before retiring Prody
an immense amount of war stores
fell into the hands of the Russians
as well ns many prisoners.
Railway bridges were dynamited,
but before the Russian army was
well into Prody. and while the
glare of burning buildings and the
explosion of munitions was still
lighting up the countryside, engi
neers were at work repairing the
damage.
Fighting is now taking place on
the northeastern corner of Galicia
for the first time since the Russian?
offensive opened.
Attacks Repulsed.
Petween the point where the Styr
river crosses from Galicia into Yol
hynia. and the range of high hills
south of Prody, the A i;stro-I I Ungar
in ns have attempted feebl rear
guard actions in order to check the
Russian advance. but these were
easily repulsed.
The fall of Brody opens the way
for an advance upon Lemberg from
th northeast and it is believed that
the Austro-Hungarians have already
made preparations to evacuate the
Galician capital. The advance guard
of the Russians, it Is estimated, is
now about 4."i miles from Lemberg.
With Lemberg in pe-ession of the
Russians. Gen. von Linsengen's army
in Yolhynia will be in a very serious

FEAR ORGY OF BLOOD
IF REPRISALS ARE MADE
Renewal of Submarine War
fare Might Follow Action
by British Against
Prisoners.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON. July -J9. -The
L'nited States can take no official
cognizance of the execution of Capt.
Fryatt, British merchant comman
der, shot after court martial by th
Germans. This was made plain in
official circles today w here it was ex
plained that the case was one en
tirely between Germany and Eng
land. Officials, however, were fearful
that out of the shooting would come
developments which might involve
this country. It is said that a de
mand will be universal throughout
England that a German submarine
or Zeppelin commander be tried and
executed in reprisal. This could be
done by courtmartialing any of the
submarin-i commanders who tor
pedoed merchant vessels, without
warning, or any commander of a
Zeppelin who participated in raids
across England.
Following the loss of the Lusila
nia, it re-quired the strongest repre
sentative measures to prevent the
pressing of resolutions through the
British parliament demanding that
submarin-? captives be treated as pi
rates. It is believed by officials here
that it will now be doubly hard to
hold such a spirit in check.
Fear Orgy of Blood.
There is hardly an ollicial here
who does not admit that if reprisals
ever are begun by any of the bel
ligerents, an orgy of blood never
before known in history must follow.
Germany, it is certain, would at
once, should there be reprisals for
the shooting of Fryatt, order an im
mediate resumption of her subma
rine warfare in the most ruthless
form. It is fully realized here that
there has been, and is, great dis
satisfaction in Germany with the
present limitation of submarine ac
tivities, due to the promise made to
the United States and no ministry
could maintain its power which
would stand by the present system
if reprisals should be undertaken
by Germany's enemies.
In the absence of the records of
the Fryatt trial, officials here with
held judgment today. They said that
under certain circumstances the ex
ecution mi-ht be proven legal under
internatic nal law, while under oth
ers it could not and that everything
depended on the evidence brought
out at the court martial. It is said
that a complete report of the pro
ceedings would be secured from the
German government through Am
bassador Gerard.

The feeling of bitterness is shared

evidenced by the following state
