(LONDON, July 29.—The British
front is withstanding Germany's most
powerful attacks. Artillery hammer
ing and massed attack irith hand to
hand fighting haa so far failed to
dent the lines advanced by the recent
British offensive.
General Haig so Indicated in his re
port today. Usually sparing of de
scriptive adjectives, the British com
mander in chief embellished his brief
statement of today with such terms
aa "hand to hand struggles continu
ing without -intermission," "violent
opposition" (by the Germans and "des
perate enemy attempts.".
It is 4he belief of military experts
here that the kaiser is now utilizing
the great reserves concentrated in
front of the British line from Verdun
and other points on the western bat
tle in a bitter endeavor to wrest
back from the Britons the land tlley
have captured in the last few days.
Despite this, Haig reported continued
progress today.
His narrative Indicated particular
ly violent engagements beyond
Pozieres from which newly captured
point the British are endeavoring to
push on toward Bapaume. There the
combat was marked by unceasing
hand to hand fighting.
Just north of liongueval at Delville
wood, British positions are under in
tense pressure from the German lines.
How sanguinary thia fighting along
the line from Thiepval to Ixmgueval
has been, was confirmed In iHalg's
opinion that two or three German reg
iments—presumably the Brandenhurg
ers— were annihilated in Delville
woods.

gigantic strides both in the eastern

[By William G. Shepherd, United
Press Staff Correspondent.]
M'ALLBN,-Texas, July 2#/—Men by
the hundreds of thousands whom I
have seen in European amies, are
in the army to fight.
Why are they in the American
army Hit or miss, I laid about me
with this question In the New York
camps today. These are some of the
answers:
Colonel Cornelius Vanderbilt! "I
Joined in cold blood. 1 have always
been Interested in the army and navy
and I felt that I ought to dq some
thing, BO fifteen years ago I tutored
for a lieutenancy in the Twelfth New
York and passed."
Major General O'Ryan: "As a boy
I always read military history. I
wanted to go to West Point but
couldn't. I went into law, t:ut as soon
as I could I turned my attention from
business. 1 gravitated to the militia.
This is the first time I've ever said
it publicly, but for many years I've
paid more attention to military af
fairs to any other of my con
cerns."
Joseph Heara, private In Company
I, Twelfth New York, and Major
General O'Ryan's orderly: "My
brother had a row with my father and
went away from home.* When he
came back after a year in a soldier's
uniform he was so much better and
my father was so happv with the
change that he told me to Join and
I did."
Dr. J. W. Abbott. *7 Washington
Square, North, lieutenant in medical
corps: "When it looked like trouble
in Mexico last May I Joined. I didn't
want it to go on my record in case
of war that I had been forced to help
my country."
Major R. L. Foster, 783 West End
avenue, Twelfth regiment: "I went
into the militia twenty-three years
ago for the same reason that my boys
are going into It. That is, because
all my people in all the rears back
have been in all the American wars."
Sergeant A. V. Park, 555 West
184th street, Company E. Seventy
first New York: "I went Into the
militia because I was a runner and
liked armory athletics."
Louis Cissell, private in Company
E, Seventy-first New York: "My
brother Roy and I lived in a boarding
house at 294 Henry street, Brooklyn,
and as we didn't booze, we didin't
know how to spend our evenings un
til A1 Leahy came to oar boarding
house from Rockaway and talked
militia to us until we both Joined."
A1 Leahy, 294 Henry street, Brook
lyn, private in Company E, Seventy
first: "I joined the militia because
Ed Mclvor, a friend of mine at Rock
away, dragged me to drill one night,
and that finished me."
Sergeant Ed Mclvor, Rockaway,
Company E, Seventy-first: "I was an
athlete and I joined because of ath
letics. Through the militia I got a
position of teaching athletics to 500
hoys in Rockaway."
Roy Cissell, Battery A, Second field
artillery: "I joined because my broth
er did. Four out of five men In our
boarding house came to Texas."

to make enemies is not smart enough
to make money.
