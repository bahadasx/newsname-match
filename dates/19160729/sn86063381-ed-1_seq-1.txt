Plan to Improve Back Roads Leading
to the Present Main
Highways.
(By United Press)
Washington, July 29.No "pork
barrel scandals" will result from the
new Shackleford good roads law just
signed by President Wilson, the
authors declare.
Instead they expect the system es
tablished, that of contributing fed
eral aid to the states for the con
struction of good roads, will be so
free from criticism and so helpful
in building up a system of internal
improvements, that congress will be
willing after the 175,000,000 is spent
to vote new appropriations.
Good roads advocates say the new
law is epoch-making. It is intended,
together with the rural credit system,
to improve the conditions of country
life and to stop the flow of population
from the country to the city.
Good roads, with the automobile,
will destroy the lonely existence of
the farmer. Opportunities of asso
ciation with neighbors, it is believed,
will make the country boy more will
ing to stay on the farm.
If the automobile owners think the
Shackleford law is intended solely for
them, they are badly fooled So says
Representative Saunders of Virginia,
one of the authors.
"There will be a howl going up if
the department of agriculture picks
for improvement only such main
roads as the automobile owners pre-
fer," said Saunders today. He is an
automobile owner himself. "We
want the back roads improved for the
man who now is hemmed in on all
sides in winter by impassable roads."
The appropriations, under the pro
visions of the law, will be paid to
the state in five installments$5,-.
000,000 the first year, $10,000,000
the second year, $15,000,000 the
third year, $2,000,000 the fourth
year and $25,000,000 the fifth year.
The money will be divided among
the states, one-third in the ratio of
the area, one-third on the basis of
population and one-third on the basis
of the number of miles of rural de
livery routes.
Payment for the construction of
roads will be on a fifty-fifty basis. If
the state agrees to provide half the
cost, the federal government will fur
nish the rest Road projects must oe
approved by the department of agri
culture and the law is entirely silent
on the nature of the improvement,
whether it is a brick, macadam or
common dirt roads. These details
are left entirely to the state.
"If this law fails to work, respon
sibility will rest on the department
of agriculture, for it is vested with
all power," said Saunders. "Congress
leaves hands off and there will be no
opportunity to say that congress has
played politics."
