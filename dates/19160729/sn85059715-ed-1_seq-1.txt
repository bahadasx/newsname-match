WHEELING, July 29. Judge Ira
10. Robinson, Republican candidate'
for governor of West Virginia, before
leaving Friday afternoon for Parkers
burg to attend the Republican subcommittee
meeting, said to a reporter:
"At the present time 1 have no particular
public statement to make, but
In due time will make a statement to ,
the voters of West Virginia, outlining
my views and plans in the coming
campaign.
"I am. of course, gratified that
General Lilly lias seen his way clear
to concede my nomination without
further contention. It was his legal
and moral right to investigate thor
oughly the details of the primary,
and 1 am clad that he and his friends
went into the matter as comprehen
sively as they did. The fact that
nothing remains h> lie cleared tip Is
one of the best assurances that there
will be no division or Inrk of har
mony in the campaign this fall.
"To my many friends in north!
West Virginia generally who sup-,
ported me in the primary, 1 wish to
return my personal thanks and hope
to have the pleasure of meeting all
of them in the near future. 1 only
repeat that If elected governor ot
West Virginia, as I expect to he. i
will aim t<5 serve the whole people j
of tile state, and no particular faction
or Interest. A primary contest like
that which we have had, Is, of course,'
liable to leave some sores for a while, ]
but personally, I Intend to forgot the I
warmth of thnt contest as speedily as
possible and to devote my attention i
to the largest contest In the state.
"This year, It seems to tne, ought)
to be a Republican yenr. The eco-:
nonilc conditions of the country, I
think, demand a return to Repubil-1
can legislation. West Virginia Is
normally and naturally a Republican (
state, it is great Industrial Interests [
that flourish under the protective |
tariff, and I look for a large Repub-i
llean majority in West Virginia."
