Since First Taken by British
July 15.
London, July 28. Delville Wood and
Longueval at last are firmly in the
grasp of Gen, Sir Douglas liaig's
forces, it was announced officially to
night. Defended almost literally 'to
Hie last man by the Hermans, the two

Pritish advance and their capture is a
source of great gratification.

"hellish scene" of the war. It is tilled

British, by hard fighting yesterday and
last night tool; all hut an acre.
To-day, they completed the task by
tiling or expelling the last of the
Fifth Urandenherg division which was
defending it. The wood is on high
ground, and therefore extremely valua
ble as a strategic point.
Delville Wood and the village of
Longueval were first taken by the Hrit
ish forces July 15. Strong German
counter attacks, in which they used a
new shell which did not explode but
emitted asphyxiating gas. forced Gen.
ilaig to yield some ground in the vil-
age and to abandon the wood entlrtiv.
Resuming the offensive, there was ter
rific lighting for the two points ever

terrific fighting of the war.

ACT CREATES ANXIETY IN U. S.
Retaliatory Measures by Great Britain
May Result in Resjmption of
Submarine Warfare.
London. July 28. The execution of
Captain Kryatt of the Hritish steam
ship Brussels by the Oerman govern
ment has aroused the British nation,
and the foreign otllce has re , test d
James W. Gerard, tho American am
bassador at Berlin, to produce com
plete details ol the affair.
According to Information received
here Captain Kryatt was sentenced to
death because while in command of
the Itritish steamship Wrexham in
11)15 be was allege:! to have attempt
ed to ram a Ccnnaii submarine.
The German government, according
to a wireless message received here,
lalma the execution of the nritish
merchant captain was on Hit! ground
that he had committed B "franc-tireur"
clinic against t,enn,in sea lorccs.
Viscount Grey, the British foreign
secretary, in a communication to Am
bar.sador Gerard, lias claim-d that the
act Ebr which Captain Kryatt paid with
bis life was ' is. etitially defensive."
The Hritish foreign office claims
that the allegation of the German gov
ernment that Captain Kryatt had with
him a watch hearing an inscription
commanding hbn tor an attempt to
ram a submarine Is untrue. Officials
of the foreign office say the charge
against Captain Kryatt must have
been based on press reports.
Captain Ktyatl was known as a "pi
rate dodger ' on account of his success
in eluding German submarines in the
channel and tiie North sea.
l"hfe foreign Office also has sent a
protect t" the American embassy ask
Inf for immediate n-b-ase oi fhe stew

News of the execution of Captain
Kryatt caused a painful Impression at
ine Mintsii foreign omce. it was on
instructions ol Viscount Grey, the
foreign secretary, thot n note was de
spatched immediately to the Ameri
can embassy.
Tho captain Kryatt case calls atten
lion to the German prize regulations
which declare that under circum
stances similar to the capture of the
Hrussels, merchantmen are to be
treated as prisoners of war.

Washington, July 28. German's
execution of Captain Charles Kryatt,
master of the British steamship Hrus
sels for an alleged attempt to ram a
submarine is icuurdod in allied rptar

Pctrograd. July 2S. via London, July
29. The Russians have occupied the
important railroad junction of Brody,
!8 miles northeast of Lemberg In Gal
icia. broken through the entire first
line of the. Teutonic allies west of
Lutsk and driven the Austro-Cerman
forces from the line of the rivers Sion
evka and Buldurovka, southern Vol
liynla, according to the official com
munication issued tonight It ytho war
office.
Heavy casualties were inflicted on
the Austio-Gernians. over HOOD men
were made prisoner and a large num
ber of guns were captured.
London, July 28. While the battle
of the Somme is continuing with metli
odical success for the Hritish forces
the Russians are able to announce
another important victory in tho cap-
ttire of Brody. This Qallcian town.
8 miles noitheast of Lemberg. is a
great railway junction. The swift
ness of this new Russian stroke was
unexpected and may lead to the cai-
t tire of Lemberg itself.
The Russians, according to a report
from Petrograd, also have broken tho
whole Austro-German front west of
Liusk. In this success they are re
ported to have captured two generals,
shoo prisoners and 4ii guns.
The fall of Hrody is b serious threat
to Lemberg and the rapid and success
ful advance of Gen. Bhakharoff's
forces menace the whole Austro-Ger-man
line of communication from the
noi th' to the south. For the present
Kovel yields in importance to lem
berg. The position on this portion of
the Russian tront seems to be that
Gen Kaledines. having driven Gen.
on Linsingcn's left wing behind tho
Stokbod river, has suspended his ad
vance toward Kovel and is holding up
the great Teutonic forces there while
Gen. Shakharnff is pressing on tow
ard Lemberg which is defended by the
for.ces of (Jen. Hoohm-Krmolll.
Petrograd correspondents attribute
: sii i-rses over the Austro-Ger-
moiis almost entirely to the over
whelming superiority of the Russian
artillery and Russia's apparently end
less supplies of ammunition.
