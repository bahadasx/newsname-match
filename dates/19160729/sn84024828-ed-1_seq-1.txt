PROPERTY ADJOINS OLD PRODUCERS
(Chloride Herald)
In the early days, maybe SO years
ago, the Chloriders worked only $200
ore at the Schenectady, and many
thousands of dollars worth of high
grade was shipped. Great things
were predicted of the property if it
-should ever be properly explored; and
this week the prophets are smiling
contentedly.
On Monday Manager Heath encoun
tered bonanza metal at the bottom of
the 120-foot shaft. The ore is an ex
act duplicate of that coming from the
1400-foot level of the Tennessee, with
this addition it carries wire silver in
appreciable quantitiy, in clusters and
streaks. A sample not showing any
silver assayed $111.40. The represen
tative of the Herald was on the ground
as soon as the strike was reported,
and before the smoke had fully cleared
away. The last shot disclosed from
eight to ten inche sof this fine ore, and
there is every indication that it is
the apex of a big chute of ore, which
may make of the Schenectady a rival
of its big neighbor, the Tennessee.
The owners of properties' in this
basin have always insisted that many
of the best veins in the camp the
Tennessee, the North Georgia, the
Payroll, the Minnesota Conners and
others centered in this special locality,
and that there would be immense ore
chutes disclosed if ever the properties
were properly explored, and their faith
seems to be fully justified. i
The Schenectady was patented when
very slightly developed and has re
mained dormant for years, until Mr.
Heath, recognizing its possibilities,
took a bond and lease and induced
some of his Colorado friends to join
him in transforming it into a real
WATER IN TOWNE
GREATLY REDUCED
From Chloride Section Dailr Miner.
Water in the No. 2 shaft of the
Towne mine has been reduced in the
shaft to a distance of 150 feet The
shaft is 230 feet deep. The manage
ment is working two shifts and ex
pects to have the mine dry'within the
next 10 days. Active operations will
commence as soon as the shaft is clear
of water.
Mining men predict that the Towne
will attract much attention to that
part of the district, as it has a record
production of over $1,200,000 in the
past The ore values are almost all
gold with some silver. The gold val
ues follow an arsenical pyrite, which
is a primary mineral. S. S. Jones,
former superintendent of the Tom
Reed, at Oatman, will direct the work
of development
UNWATERiNG OF THE
E
From Chloride Section Dally Miner.
The old Empire mine, located about
one mile north of the Elkhart, and
marking the northerly limit of the pro
ducing section, has been recently un
watered and cleaned out by its present
owners, the United States Smelting
company. The shaft is about 165 feet
deep, and good ore has just been
struck on the 150-foot level. It was a
good producer in the early days, be
ing the first patented claim in the
camp, and having a record of from
$75,000 to $100,000, and paid well
from the grass roots down. The ore
is galena and horn silver. The re
cent discovery takes it out of the
ranks of the "has beens" and puts it
with the Schenectady in the revenue
producing class.
Sulphides assaying from $48 up are
coming in at the Rescue.
HAS
mine. That his labors have been re
warded at sucli a comparatively shal
lo wdepth (120 feet) is a matter of
congratulation, not only to him and
the owners of adjoining claims, but to
the whole camp. The Herald has been
telling its readers that there were
scores of old properties in the Cerbats,
worked at a profit by Chloriders in the
early days, which only needed a lim
ited expenditure of capital to put them
again in the producing class, and now
we have the satisfaction of saying
"Didn't I tell you so."
There are other good propositions
open, and now is the time to get into
the game. The man with real money
cannot do better than take a hand
right now. It's a fair game an in
teresting game, and a profitable game.
The hot air artist who cannot buy
chips had better stay out.
In connection with the Schenectady,
a pretty good story is told on one of
the old timers who is still living here.
It seems, that years ago, he was
wrongfully suspected of having appro
priated to his own use a quantity of
good ore which had been left on the
dump. A warrant was issued and the
sheriff escorted him to the county bas
tile at Mineral Park. Bus'iness had
been dull at this hotel And the jailer
made him this proposition:
"You are not busy just now and I
am lonesome as h 1. Why not stay
here with me instead of giving bond?
I will give you good grub, and you can
go uptown whenever you feel the need
of liquid refreshment."
This appealed to the old timer, and
he remained there for a whole month,
getting three squares every day and
plenty of drinks. He was then tried,
and, of course, acquitted.
BLACKFOOT GROUP
From Thurdri Dailr Miner
The Blackfoot and adjoining claim
have been relocated by Mr. Brooks on
the ground that the annual assessment
work was not completed, and that the
cyompany did not pay for the work
done. The property has a 225-foot
shaft and a gasoline hoist
In regard to this matter, Postmaster
Russell .says he did the work for the
Blackfoot company for 1914, and on
their failure to settle, filed his lien, se
cured "judgment and bid in the prop
erty, and will receive' his deed very
shortly.
Pending the time for redemption he
performed the work for 1915 at his
own expense in order to protect his
rights.
As this is presumably a valuable
property it seems a great pity that it
should be involved in litigation when
times are picking up and a sale might
be made.
INVADE KINGMAN
From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
The Chloride boosters were in King
man today arousing interest in the
big dance to be given by the Chamber
of Commerce next Tuesday. If any
young lady of Kingman was not in
vited it was because the boys did not
catch sight of her. They returned in
the evening, reporting that they were
treated royally by the Kingman folk,
who promised to turn out in great
numbers to help make the event a
complete success.
J. S. Amundsen, manager of the
Arizona Stores company, arrived home
yesterday from a ten days' vacation
at Long Beach, where his family is
spending the summer.
E
In the past 90 days the greatest (
! record for underground work in the !

tance to the line on that level is 320
feet On the 200 the drift is consid
erably closer to the line, being some
thing more than 150 feet. Work here
was suspended for quite awhile but
will be resumed at once.
In the last 30 days particularly the
work was decisive in opening new ore
on the 400 or bottom level. Five hun
dred feet south of the shaft the new
shoot was opened by a crosscut to the
east exposed a body eight feet wide,
which is at least 60 feet in length. On
the 350 feet another crosscut has open
ed ore 20 feet wide. Quite as impor
tant is the result of sampling of the
shoots on the 400 level, which has been
completed, ine results show an av
erage throughout of $13 a ton.
Manager Eugene H. Dawson is a
part owner of the mine, with the Bos
ton shoe manufacturers, and it is un
derstood that it is an effort to repress
a feeling of exultation over his great
est or one great success after many
years of Iaborous effort. This includes
the mineral countries of Central
America and South America, where
ore bodies and ledges are nearer
synonymous terms than here, which is
another way of saying a great deal
for Oatman.
EXPRESS TRUCK TO
E DAILY TRIPS
fc.very morning at 4 o clock a new
Stevens-Duryea truck, with a capacity
of a ton and a half, will leave King
man for Oatman and on the return
trip will leave Oatman at noon.
By special arrangement this truck
starts at this early hour to bring
copies of the Mohave Daily Miner to
its readers in Oatman. The first trip
was yesterday morning and at 6:30 the
papers were in Oatman and being sold
on the streets by the newsboys, the
earliest they ever reached here.
The owner and driver of the truck is
R. O. Stokoe. He is a thoroughly re
liable young man, with the "go" in
him and a" good mechanic. He prom
ises to make the trip between King
man and Oatman in three hours, but
on his first tryout lowered the time
to two and a half hours.
While the expense of making his
trips on such a schedule is consider
able and is freely borne by the Daily
Miner, it is not the sole object of Mr.
Stokoe and would not cover the
amount he is entitled to as an income
commensurate with his enterprise. If
it were merely to carry the papers it
would be a runabout or a motorcycle.
But he is after express and freight
business, as much as he can get of It
up to a ton and a half each way every
day. Leaving Oatman at noon as he
does it gives him a chance during busi
ness hours to attend to errands for
patrons at either end. Already he has
the promise of other carrying business
than that of this newspaper and he is
entitled to it It is to the interest of
business men of both towns to take ad
vantage of this exceptional opportuni
ty. It means much for the trade rela
tions of the two towns.
RECEIVES SHIPMENT
OF MIXING MACHINERY
C. A.Parisia, superintendent of the
Johnny Bull and Silver Knight prop
erty, has received shipment of a
Stover 18-horsepower hoist," 300 feet
of wire cable and other equipment for
this property.
The equipment will be installed im
mediately to facilitate the sinking of
the main shaft to the 300-foot level,
to which point the shaft will be
driven before crosscutting the ledge.

KAY PROPERTY HI
IS
SOLD TO EASTERNERS
From Fridart Dailr Miner
J. A. Salsbury, of New York city,
representing large eastern interests,
has purchased the Kay copper prop
erty at Mineral Park, upon which Dr.
M. Taylor Uhler had an option.
The terms of the purchase are said
to require a payment of $25,000 cash,
followed by payments in 30 to 60 days.
The purchasers are to equip the prop
erty, sink a shaft to a depth of 800
feet and explore the vein at various
points. The Kay mine is one of the

From Oatman Section Dailr Miner.
It was not a public nor private

into the Bank of Oatman building
Wednesday was used in the justice
court merely as evidence in the trial
of a case and not one of them was
tapped to ascertain whether or not

C. A. Whipple, who has a ranch
down along the Colorado river, has
missed a lot of melons lately. He says
over $150 worth. He laid in wait
many a long and weary day and night
trying to discover which way he mel

CONTRACTORS LEAVE j
MANY UNPAID BILLS
From Wedneidar'a Dailr Miner
Many creditors of Messrs. Richard
son and Butterworth, contractors, are
mourning their departure from Kinsr
man. They were paid a large sum of
money last Saturday by Mrs. Man-
Eleanor Cohenour on several building
contracts, ana immediately left the
town. It was thought that they had
gone to a neighboring town to look
after some contracts and on their re
turn would pay off merchants' and
builders' claims, but they failed to
return.
Material dealers, merchants, and
others were mulcted in various sums,
Even a poor old Mexican woman was
defrauded of $40. In all more than
$1000 was secured by the men. They
had been building and contracting for
houses in Kingman for several months
and had established unlimited credit.
Under the laws of the state the
men may be brought back, if appre
hended, and prosecuted.

"Or is it on account of the great
tonnages of ore in the mines, and the
fair milling averages?" said the re
porter. "That's it: that is the reason,'
answered he. "The great volume,
length, width and average value of ore
in the United Eastern and what has
been taken out of the Tom Reed and
Goldroad. these are what have at
tracted attention and are causing in
vestors to look this way."
"Is it large or small money?"
"Big money. The men with lots of
money are the ones investing in min
ing, and where the big ones go you
can depend that the public will follow.
"In every city of the east the men
of large capital have their ears to the
ground for mining opportunities; for
properties that have a chance of mak
ing mines. It would surprise you
where the money is coming from. It
is from a class of investors that you
would least suspect"
"Are there not such opportunities
in the vicinity of the Pioneer mine
where you are interested?" he was
asked.
"Oh, yes, fine. There are some
great prospects there that with de
velopment will be mines, just the kind
the eastern capitalists are looking
for."

L
NEEDS DEPTH
TO GET IE
It looks exceedingly roseate for the
Arizona-Central making a big strike
and coming into its own a little later
on as one of the mines of the camp.
The ledge that was struck at 200
feet was thoroughly sampled by Su
perintendent W. H. Hart and gave aa
average assay of $5.58 a ton. After
12 or 14 feet by vertical measurement
the shaft passed out of the vein. Its
horizontal measurement was seven
feet This being at the 200 foot point.
the management feels that to expect
milling values at 500 is only conserva
tive, Ten dollar values there would
be quite in keeping with average per
centages of increase with more depth
in this camp. The ledge matter as
taken out at the intersection of this
vein is more quartz than calcite.
The Central's quartz very much re
sembles that of the Big Jim, Tom
Reed and United Eastern. It looks as
much like ore as any of them, and with
more depth there will be no question
of its being ore. Drifting at the pres
ent depth might increase the values
by running more into the shoot, but
that is not the policy of the manage
ment, -which is to go down to the 500
foot point before doing a foot of lat
eral work, other than cutting stations
at the 300 and 400 foot points.
The Central surely is on a bee-line
for the Big Jim, Tom Reed and East
ern ore. A few feet to the northeast
of the Central shaft is a rhyolite dyke
that strikes northwesterly and south
easterly across the corner of the prop
erty, and between the shaft and that
of the United Western. It is the opin
ion of Mr. Hart that a big ore body
will be found at the intersection of
this ledge and the dyke.
Y
ON TENNESSEE AVE.
From Chloride Section Dailr Miner.
The past few days has shown a won
derful improvement along Tennessee
avenue. Commencing with the new
front of the Chloride store, which
greatly adds to the beauty of the
street, the dance pavilion, just to the
north of the main avenue, is in opera
tion. North of the latter is the pro
duce shop of Royse & Boyd, which is
filling a long felt want Next to this
place is "Smoky's" restaurant Drop
ping back to Tennessee, the new 01
sen furnishing store is almost ready
to open its doors. Continuing west at
least a dozen small places are con
structed or under construction.
The largest proposed building in
the heart of the business district is
that to be constructed by Marion J.
Aubineau, who will build a fireproof
building at Tennessee and Second
streets. When completed it will be
occupied by a drug store intended to
be the finest pharmacy west of Phoe
nix. Mr. Aubineau will lease his pres
ent store as soon as he moves into the
new quarters.
QUARTZ AND GYPSUM
IN CASH ENTRY SHAFT
A lot of silicified material is ap
pearing in the shaft of the Cash Entry
and it looks so well to Superintendent
James Curtin that he would be little
surprised to run into a ledge at any
moment
The appearance of gypsum interests
him especially. It was the forerunner
of one of the best strikes in the camp,
he says, and upon this evidence he
bases his hopes for something unusual
once the ledge is struck. However,
he did not expect the ledge this soon,
and he may, in fact, be a long way
from it yet The shaft is down 140
feet, and he estimates that it will take
250 feet to encounter the ledge. The
dip on the surface appears to be al
most negligible, it being so nearly
vertical as to be less than 85 degrees.
Mr. Curtin brought some of the
altered material to town yesterday. It
is a peculiarly plastic substance and
dissolves under pressure of the
fingers. It is a pure white. The gyp
sum and spar are a mixture in the
same matrix as the particles of
quartz.
Thomas Hunter, deputy sheriff at
Oatman, was in Kingman Tuesday.
