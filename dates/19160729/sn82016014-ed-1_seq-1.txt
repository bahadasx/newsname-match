The first official move designating
Topeka as the interurban center of
Kansas and developing a large section
of the Kaw valley contributory to the
business interests of this city, was
brought about today with the an
nouncement that effective September
1 the Leavenworth & Topeka railway
is to become the property of the Wil-
Itoute Intonirban Line. Topeka to I-eavenworth to Kansas City. The T .en Yen worth St Topeka Line will be electrified

course of the Interurban and the U. P., Santa I-'e and Rock Island.
lard E. Winner interests of Kansas
City, Mo. Immediately after the prop
erty Is turned over to the purchasers
plans will be made for electrifying the
line between Topeka and Leavenworth.
At the same time a branch will be
built from Boling to Lansing connect
ing with the Kansas City & Leaven
worth interurban and thereby leading
directly Into Kansas City, Mo. While
this branch Is under construction the
old Leavenworth & Topeka grade be
tween this city and Meriden, west of
the present steam road, will be utilized
and rails will be laid.
Hourly Service.
As a result of this activity, Topeka
in a few months will have hourly elec
tric passenger, express and freight ser
vice with Leavenworth and Kansas
City. Effective September 1 the pur
chasers of the Leavenworth & Topeka
will operate steam trains until the
road can be electrified. These trains
will be operated between Topeka and
Leavenworth. Sunday excursions will
be advertised beginning late In Sep
tember. The announcement of this project
giving Topeka her first real interurban
connection with a wonderfully produc
tive territory and with Kansas City
was made in Topeka today by C. J.
Smith of Kansas City, associated with
the Winner interests. The announce
ment of the sale of the Leavenworth
& Topeka for a small sum of $27b.O(IO
was confirmed by E. L. Copeland.
secretary and treasurer of the Santa
Fe railway in Topeka today.
West From Leavenworth.
The Santa Fe and Union Pacific
v. ill continue to operate the road un
til September 1. When it is taken
i ver by the purchasers it will continue
to be operated as a steam line until it
is electrified, which. Winner officials
promise, will be in a short time. Work
.f electrifying the road will begin in
Leavenworth and proceed west to
aierirter.. From Meriden to Topeka a
new track will be laid over the grade
built between the two points by the
I.f-avenworth & Topeka thirty-four
years ago. The grade, after lyin? un
ufed for more than :i quarter of a cen
tury, is in an excellent btate of preser
vation. The only thing the- Winner
interests will have to do is lav the
track and construct the bridges and
culverts, the largest bridge leinu the
one necessary over Soldier creek.
Through North Topeka.
The new road, it was asserted, will
enter North Topeka near Garfield
park and connect with the Topeka
Street railway's tracks at the end of
X.Ue North Kansas avenue line, over
whlch the cars will run to the South
Offices of the interurban will be lo
cated here. The power house will
either be located here or in Leaven
worth, probably here, it is said.
After construction work is com
pleted and the line Is electrified from
here to Leavenworth the interurban
company will build a cutoff between
Boling and Lansing, a distance of five
miles. The cutoff will connect the
main line of the Leavenworth & To
peka railway with the Kansas City
Leavenworth Interurban line at those
points.
A traffic agreement is planned to
be made- to run their cars into Kansas
City. That will complete an Inteinr
ban line between Kansas City and To
peka as short as any of the steam
lines. The length of the electric line
between the two points will be about
ventv miles. Then construction
vork on a branch line to Valley Falls
and Holton will begin.
Take It Over September 1.
Beginning September 1, when the
Winner interests will continue to
operate the line as a steam road, until
the line is electrified, the company
will take its first step toward revolu
tionizing the service. While regular
service, passenger and freight, will be
maintained six days of the week, the
passenger service will be doubled on
Sundays. Excursions will be made
into Topeka and to points along the
line.
Sunday Kxcursions.
The road will advertise Topeka, its
parks, its museums and state buildings
and the surrounding territory, as an
excursion center. Some of the most
attractive fishing, outing and camping
resorts and locations in the middle
west are on the line between this city
and Leavenworth. They will be de
veloped by the road. Topekans, while
the road is being operated as a steam
line even, will find It possible to es-
I
O VU G LA S
cape, for a few hours, from their bus
iness duties and spend the week-end
in these places. . After electric cars
are placed In service, and they will
run every hour from both terminals,
a jaunt into the wooded hills and re
sorts will possible any time.
Good Freight Service.
In connection with passenger serv
ice, the Winner interests announce
they will maintain an adequate freight
service. The territory through whlca
the road runs is exceptionally rich
agriculturally. Its only drawback is
the absence of transportation to To-
poka ana Kansas City.
The new line will make a specialty
also of milk and dairy transportation.
That, they believe, will be of much
benefit to Topeka creameries and
milk stations. Topeka Is prepared to
handle such shipments. The largest
creamery in the world is located
heie.
New Line Prospectus.
C. J. Smith, a former Topekan. who
lived here seven years ago and estab
lished the Jackson-Walker coal busi
ness, is In Topeka today representing
the Winner Interests and discussing
prospects of the new line. Mr. Smith's
announcement that the new line will
be built was the first definite informa
tion besides the promise of the Helm
lines to build here, to be received to
the effect that Topeka Is to have an
interurban the latter part of this year
or the first part of next, although
there have been wild rumors of ln
terurbans by the score. He was told
Topeka business men would not only
welcome the line but they would as
sure It their patronage and co-operation.
"We intend to develop the territory
through which the line runs. We are
confident It will be a good investment
for the backers and linimf ii-iu 1 tn
business and agricultural interests in
its territory.
Rates Will Be Lowe-.
"We will be able to haul passengers
for rates lower than steam lines can.
Interurbans are not under the Inter
state commerce commission. Begin
ning in September, we will advertise
the state capital as an excursion point.
The state fair here will be one of our
biggest cards this year and we expect
to haul thousands of persons to It."
The amount of the consideration.
121S.0G0, in the transfer of the road is
causing considerable comment in rail
road circles here and it is considered
a "song." The purchase Included the
equipment, right of way between To
peka and Leavenworth and other
properties of the road.
The Winner interests assumed all
liabilities.
Officials of the Santa Fe and Union
Pacific systems said today they were
fully in accord with the Winner inter
ests' pinna. The steam line officials

A real traffic ordinance which will

according to an announcement made
this morning by Mayor J. E. House.
Safety zones similar to those in Kansas
City, "Jay" walking rules, traffic cops,
the city's purse permitting, rules af
fecting parking of cars and a change
in the speed laws will be features em
bodied in the proposed ordinance
which will be drafted by the city at
torney. "There have been rumors of a new
traffic ordinance all summer," said the
mayor. "Rumors will change to real
ity by August 16. And you can bet
the ordinance will be enforced after it
is passed."
Demand of Commercial Club.
Real action of the city in passing
something besides a conversational
ordinance follows on the heels of
numerous suggestions to Mayor House
by members of the Commercial and
JO HNSON A
Automobile clubs. Within the last
two weeks Mayor House has been in
receipt of letters and personal calls
from Topeka citizens who have been
the victims of near and real accidents
as a result of traffic conditions exist
ing in Topeka at this time. One busi
ness man, and a careful driver, was
run into three times within two weeks
as a result of the lack of drastic traf
fic laws and nonenforcement of those
already in existence.
The ordinance which City Attorney
Hayden has been instructed to pre
pare will resemble that in force at
Lafayette, Ind.. asserted to be one of
the best governed cities in the coun
try from a traffic standpoint.
Increase Speed Limit.
The speed limit will be increased in
order to make its enforcement effect
ive. Automobiles parked on Kansas
avenue and other streets must be
placed on a bias and thus make en
trance to buildings not prohibitive In
case of fire. Square corners will be
in order in crossing streets.
A "hick" town stroll across Kansas
avenue between Intersecting streets
will cost the pedestrian something.
Safety zone poles will be supplied by
the street railway company, it 's un
derstood. "The primaries and booze business
have been occupying our energies re
cently," said the mayor, "but the lat
ter part of the summer will be a busy
time for the police In establishing real
city ideas in the heads of automobile
drivers and pedestrians."
THROWN FROM A BUGGY

SUMMER
In the summer there is likely
to be more heat than in other
seasons, especially in the tem
perate zone. Extreme care
should be taken to keep your
self at a temperature of about
98.6. If you find your tempera
ture rising a few degrees it is
well to consult a bartender;
whereas, if it falls a few de
grees you should sit in a warm
place and think intently of the
administration's Mexican policy.
By observing these simple pre
cautions there is no reason why

Little Black Dog Stood
Guard at His Side.
When early morning pedestrians
found the dead body of John Karr in
the street near City park today they
found his little black dog the only
companion of a lonely old man
curled up by his side.
The police were notified and when
they reached the body the dog was
still there on guard.
Karr was nearly seventy yean; of
age. His death Is believed to have
been due to heart trouble aggravated
by extreme heat and exertion. He
lived at 901 North Kansas avenue and
was a paperhanger by trade. He has
relatives in Colorado. They passed
through Topeka several weeks ago and
made arrangements with a local man
to see that the old man was given a
proper burial when he died.
Early this morning Karr pushed a
two wheeled cart across the Melan
bridge to the river bank in City
park. He loaded three logs on the
cart and started pushing it towards
home. No one has been found who
saw him fall but soon after he was
seen loading logs in the park his t-orty
waa found on the street.
The body was taken to Shella
barger's undertaking rooms. No one
paid any attention to the dog. He fol
lowed the body to the center of tow
and then became lost among the ve
il icles.

LOSE THEJPPAM
Federal Judge Decides Against
German Raiders.
Rights Annulled by Bringing It
to ?feutral Harbor.
Norfolk, July 29. Federal Judge
Waddell today decided the libel pro
ceedings for possession of the captur
ed British liner Appam In favor of
the English owners and against the
German prize crew which brought
her here. The court held that the
German government lost all claim to
the Appam and her cargo as prizes
of war when Lieutenant Berg and his
prize crew on last February 1,
brought them into the neutral waters
of Hampton Roads with the intention
of "laying up" the vessel Indefinitely.
The court held further that the
Prussian-American treaty of 1799, re
newed in 1828, does not apply or con
trol In the case so as to guarantee
the prize crew asylum In the United
States waters.
That the action of the German prize
court in declaring the Appam a prize,
while the case was In litigation In the
United States courts has no effect on
the jurisdiction of the court. That
the jurisdiction of the United States
courts in the case Is established by a
long line of precedents including sev
eral by the supreme court.
German Court Doesn't Agree.
In conclusion the decision reads:
"The manner of bringing the Appam
Into the waters of the United States
constitutes a violation of the neutrality
of the United States: that she came In
without bidding or permission; that
she is here in violation of the law:
that ehe is unable to leave for lack of
a crew, which she cannot provide or
augment without further violation of
neutrality; that In her present condi
tion she is without a lawful right to be
and remain in these waters; that she.
as Detween ner captors and owners, to
an practical intents and purposes, must
ue treaiea as aDanaonea and stranded
upon our shores: and that her owners
are entitled to restitution of their
property which this court should
award, irrespective of the prize court
proceedings or the court of the im
perial government of the German em
pire; and it will be so ordered.

Iowa Fears Worst and Colorado
Hard Hit by Heat.
Lincoln, Neb., July 29. Nebraska
crops have so far not been injured by
the drouth, and the hot, dry weather
of the past few weeks will have proved
good corn weather provided rain
comes within the next week or ten
days. The corn situation over the
state has been very good so far this
year and the crop outlook is good pro
vided the dry weather does not con
tinue too long and hot winds are es
caped. In some parts of the state,
principally along the Kansas line,
some firing has been reported and
some farmers are alarmed, but others
declare the damage will be smalt, if
any, if rain comes within several days.
There has been no general rain over
the state for two weeks, though there
have been scattered local showers.
Tassels Brown Prematurely.
Des M oi nes, la,, July 29 . Two
weeks of record breaking heat has not
injured the Iowa corn crop, except in
a few places, in" the opinion of the
weather and crop director, Chappell,
but unless the heat wave is broken,
tassels will be burned, pollen destroyed
and the crop injured. Many fields
have corn eight feet in height and all
danger of late frost is over and should
the heat wave be broken in 48 hours
the damage will be nominal.
Wheat, oats and hay have been a
fine crop but berries have suffered
from the heat and garden truck and
melons and even grapes are in danger.

Two Deaths In K. C. Today.
Kansas City, July 29. Despite a

Slight hopes were held today by the
United States weather forecaster that
a break in the high temperature was
possible late today, although he ex
pected the day would .witness ther
mometer readings well into the nine

Explanations given were that If the
present high barometric pressure in
the North Pacific continued to de

and showers in this section. Kansas
City's temperature at 11 o'clock this
morning was 8 degrees four less than
