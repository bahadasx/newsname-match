SECRETARY OF STATE
MATTSON IS OUT FOR I
PASSAGE OF 'DRY LAW I
Salt Laky, July 28. David Mattson
Secretary of State, hns Issued a state
ment In which ho suys tho tlmo has
como for the Legislature of Utah to
enact a stato wide prohibition law
and In nn analysis of the situation de
clares that tho pcoplo of the Btato
want prohibition and they will get It
through tho Legislature and tho num
ber of men In tho Legislature plcdg
cd to prohibition will be sufficient to
pass tho bill over the veto of the
chief executive, if such a veto should
tako place. Ho declares that the Re
publican party wilt sweep thu stato
If the platform to bo adopted at Og
den contains a provision for state
wide prohibition and announces that
Un is In favor of state wldo prohibi
tion and will mako his campaign for
rcnomlnatlon as secretary of stato on
such a platform.
"It Is plain to me," said Mr. Matt
son, "that tho pcoplo of this state
want prohibition nnd it will bo sure
sulcldo for any political party to op
pose tho movement. Much has been
said about submitting this questlon'to
I ho people nt a special election to bo
provided for by tho next Legislature.
If there were any rcusonabte grounds
for uncertainty as to tho temper of
the people on this matter, there mlghi
be some excuse for such a proposition.
But It is simply a stall for tlmo, and
nothing moro.
Says People Demand It
"In my opinion the people have al
ready oxpressod themselves on the
question. The result of tho general
ilcctlon two years ago goes to prove
this. Moreover, tho action taken by
u strung majority of tho people's rep
resentatlvee In tho 1915 session of
the Legislature furnished irro &(e
evidence of what tho peoplo wonted
at that tlmo. If thero Iras been a
change In public sentiment slnco that
time, It ha3 been to Intensify the
popular demand for prohibition
"In view of existing conditions, 1
full to see what tho antlprohlbltlon
lsts can hope to gain by contlnIng
their unconditional opposition to tho
movement. Thero Is no posslblo
chance to longer withstand tho issuo
Regardless of tho polttlcnl complex
Ion of the next Legislature, stato wldo
prohibition will bo provided by direct
teglslativo enactment, and It It be
comes necessary It will bo passod ov
ed tho head of tho executlvo who
dares to voto It.
"Consider tho situation, Thero aro
nine holdover stato senators. Ulghr
of this number aro already on rocord J
for prohibition nnd each nnd every H
ono of them Is determined to recoup B
tho loss their cause sustained In tho J K
last session, when their earnost or- , B
forts wero overridden by executive B'l
action. Thoso eight men aro soason- sJ
ed nnd prepared to lead tlie fight to Ml
a declslvo conclusion. Of tho nlna Rf
now senators to bo elected, it Is safo N
to presume that at least Ave .wlfljbe II
personally pledged to prohibition. OKI
Hence, tho next Senate Is bound' to fjl
lmvo a working majority, even over .Vfl
tho governor's veto, should such a
situation arise. jU
House For Prohibition MM
"Tho next Houso will likewise bo uVl
overwhelmingly for a stato wide pro- vil
hlbltlon raensuro and as 1 analyzo 'MM
tho situation It too will be strong
enough to pass such an act over tho Ml
vnto. Twenty-four counties aro suro Vt
to pledge their representatives for WM
direct legislative enactment and It 'M
would not surprlso mo In the least if ttfl
two of tho four remaining counties H
will not tako similar action at the H
"How then can tho antlprohlbltlon-
lsts hope to succeed? To my mind H
they aro merely inviting drastic ac-
tlon and disastrous consequences to H
themsolves. Unless they chango their M
present attltudo, It would seem that H
they themsolves aro moro unreason- Jl
ablo than tho prohibitionists. It is ift
my Idea that thoy can best gain a jfi
consideration of tho merits of their 71
cause by uccoptlng tho Inevitable and I
assuming a conciliatory attltudo. II
Moreovor, I bellovo that tho prohlbi- 11
tlonlsts, unless forced to resort to fix- JM
tromo measures, aro universally of a M
mind to bring about the desired cr- fl
der ot things without working any un- fH
necessary hardship or Injury upon any iH
person or concern. itlH
"Personally, I would like to see all H
ot tho political parties tako favorable
posltlvo actton on tho prohibition !H
question and thereby removo it as a fH
campaign issuo. Then, when the next VJ
Legislature convenos, It would bo pos- VH
slblo for not only tho prohibitionists, IH
but ftU other persons concerned, to H
meet on mutual grounds of public In H
leren nnd enact a satisfactory mens- H
tiro that would forover settle tho mut- H
ter. Until this question Is dollnltoly H
settled, other matters also ot vltal H
concern to tho peoplo will not set tho lH
attention they deserve," VM
