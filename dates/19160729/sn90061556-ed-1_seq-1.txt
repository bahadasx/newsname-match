RACE PRIDE.
Is it true the black man tried,
Even though he was doomed
to lose?
Is it true the. white man tried.
Because he knew hevould not
lose?
Is it true the black man can't
Bo fit to serve his own?
Is It true the white man can't
-Lot the black man servo his
own?
Why doe3 the black man think,
The white man Is his friend?
Why does the white man wink,
When he sees the black man
descend?
Oh! ye Ethyoplan race of today,
Pause for a moment I pray;
Have pity on the girl and boy,
Whose thoughts you constant
ly destroy.
Take the black man who has
money.
As a rule, he's above his race;
Tako the white man who has
money,
As a rule he's w'th his" race.
. -
Take the black man who's a
leader,
He strives to leave his race;
Tako the white man who's a
leader.
He strives to better his race.
If the Ethyopians are to rise,
To the highest point in life;
Good sense they should exer
cise", , , .
throughout their toll and
strife.
Oh! ye Ethyoplan race of today,
"Take heed to what I say;
I am only a minor, of the race.
Yes, the race that loves dis
grace. By A. Lorenzo Countee. '
