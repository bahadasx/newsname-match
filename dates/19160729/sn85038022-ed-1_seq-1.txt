t is. ml counties. Germantown la the
moat convenient place to hold the
chautauqua.a o the sessions will be In
the Fair Grounds at that place.
It la up to every farmer in the three
counties to take advantage of the op
portunity and become a modern, scien
tific farmer. The Farmera Chautau
qua movement la here to atay. They
have been held In various parts of the
state for the past three years and not
one failure has been experienced. Ev
ery farmer who has the welfare of his
community at heart, the betterment of
his environments, ia urged to come
and make the Chautauqua a perma

The best way to educate the farmer
ia to have him exchange Ideas with
his fellow farmer and discuss the
problems with the Farm Educators
of Kentucky. The Chautauqua will
furnish means. The best farmera of
the three counties will be present, and
the leading farm educators will be
more than willing to answer any and
