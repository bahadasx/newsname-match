EVENTUAL SOLUTION OF
THE IRISH PROBLEM
David Lloyd George Has Utmost
Confidence In It.
London, July 2S, 7:00 p. m. "I
don't despair about an eventual solu
tion of the Irish problem, in spite
of the recent failure to reach an
agreement between the Nationalists
and the -Unionists," said David Lloyd
George today.
He was replying: to a request from
The Associated Press for his views
on the breakdown of the negotiations
for putting the Irish home, rule act
into effect immediately.
"We achieved at least one thing
that had never hitherto been aeomp
lished," continued the British war
secretary. "We brought the repre
sentatives of the. Irish Nationalists
and the Ulster Unionists to the point
of shaking- hands, instead of shaking
fists at each other.
Mr. Lloyd Geurgo, acting as the
chosen arbitrator in the century-old
Irish controversy, had succeeded in
so far mollifying the opposing fac
tions that he had brought them with
in measurable distance of reaching an
agreement. Then ilr. Lloyd George
said in a tone of regret today, fate
intervened, as it h;Kl so often ibme bo
fore in .Irish ati'airs and at the last
moment a breach occurred.
The secretary for war. however, is
still full of optimism regarding the
Irish difficulty. He feels about this
problem as about everything else be
undertakes that a solution can be
reached: and it is his intention to
strive on until he is successful.

These stated that the recent re
strictions upon free trade between
Mexican states have boon annulled as
unnecessary as have l)-en extra ex
port nd import duties at the ports of
Mexico. It wa.s pointed out that t'ais
does not mean the removal of a il
daties. but rather the removal of
those that were proving imperiments
to commerce. It added that mer
chants may now charge their even,
prices in paper money for g .nds, on
the basis of its exchange value.
t a. ne-ral Trevino cocferred to--?a--with
Generals Francisco Gon?ai"S.
commanding the army in noiahern
Chihuahua, and Gabriel Ga.vira. in-speitee-
