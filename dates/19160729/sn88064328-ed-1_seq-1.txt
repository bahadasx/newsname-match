A DISTRICT ATTORNEY had lived a lonely
life with a wife devoted entirely to frivolous ■
society. Tragedy came to this man through
his love for little children, tho' he little sus
- pected that his wife's childless condition was
due to her own selfishness and butterfly ex
istence.
WHEN he discovered she was to blame for
the absence °f the little ones he loved, he
knew she was as guilty as the fashionable
physician whom he convicted and sent to
prison for fifteen years for "mal practice.
If y°u believe in the punishment of criminal
doctors, whose machinations are today snuff

What the New York Critics, Press, Clergy, Etc., Have to
Say: .
*It will make women think, and think hard—it will make
them look before they leap—it will act as a powerful warning
to young girls."—New York Journal.
"A smashing, daring subject done in a smashing, daring
way."—New York American.
"Worth seeing. The story is delicately drawn. Certain
to provoke no end of discussion."—New York Telegraph.
"Presents a great moral lesson that is most tragically
needed in this prudish besmugged age."—Bernard McFadden.
"It deals with a most difficult matter in a manner of ut
most dignity. A powerful and gripping picture drama."—
Rev. Dr. Parkhurst.
What Prominent New Orleans People Hare to Say:
"Every person in New Orleans over sixteen years of age
should see "Where Are My Children?" Mothers should be
more careful to enlighten their daughters and avoid the death
bed hoene of this picture."—Mrs. J. 6. Skinner, Secretary As
sociated Mothers' Co-operative Clubs of New Orleans.
"Where Are My Children!" can accomplish more good
for humanity than a thousand pulpit-delivered sermons.—Mary
C. Gillespie, president State Nurses' Association.
"Where Are My Children?" is a moral lesson, more potent
for the good than any five hundred sermons. The questions
involved are of far greater importance than the European war.
The picture does not and cannot cover all the many phases of
this immense subject, "but, nevertheless, every man, woman,
young and old, should see it, and will be benefited by so doing.

TO DEVELOP GRAND ISLE
COUNTRY.
New Orleans, July 29.—For the
first time in its history the re
markably rich country south of
New Orleans, alonfj; the lower
coast and over toward (Grand
Isle, will feel the touch of con
certed and concentrated develop-[
ment at the hands of a syndicate
of well known New Orleans capi
talists who, having acquired the
Grand Isle Railroad reaching
from New Orleans into that dis
trict, are prepared to spend ade
quate sums to develop the big
commercial possibilities which
heretofore have had no attention
of this character. The members
of the syndicate are Hugh Mac
Closkey, President of the Amer
ican Cities Co. and Director of
the Hibernia Bank ; Bernard Me
Closkey, Attorney; Frank B.
Ilayne, Director of'the Ilibernia
Bank, merchant and capitalist;
C. E. Allgeyer, C. 1'. Ellis and T.
G. Bush, all cotton merchants
and men of means; Walter G.
Weiss, Généras Dufous, Lee Be
noist and Hugh Vincent, Harrison
D. Emerson is General Manager
of the properties which, under i
his administration, have already
begun to show an increase in
earnings.
The purpose of the syndicate
is to devote its present attention j
to the purely commercial and in- !
dustrial side of developing traffic.

QUALITY BRINGS QUANTITY.
When you employ a man to
drive your team on the farm you
jdo not select a weakling who
(would stagger under a fifty
pound weight. You want a man.
When yon want a horse for
speed and endurance you do not
I pick up a sway-backed, string
halted and spavined plug. If
I you did you would live and die
in the shadow of the same spot.
Then why should not the same
farsighted sagacity be applied to
the selection of your dairy stock ?
Too many people are content to|
buy dairy stock of inferior breed
and trust to quantity to produce
the financial returns. Their ex
pectations are seldom realized.
Quantity is quantity, but it is
quality that brings the price.
Quantity, in fact, is one of the
underlying results of quality, and
the man who keeps up the quality
invariably reaps the reward of
both quality and quantity.
There is no economy, no spirit
of thrift, in buying cheap dairy
stock, for a cheap cow, like every
thing else cheap, is just simply
cheap.
It is the essence of wisdom to
!?et good stock and keep un the
breed. The quantity of milk will
be greater, the quality will be
higher, and the financial returns
will be larger.
Quality brines quantity, in
dairying as well as in all other
lines of busine*.—'Times Pica

tion.
"What is to be done about it?
you may ask.
The question presents itself,
first, to mill owners—particularly
the substantial classes who own
the land, as \*ell as the timber.
Then it vitally concerns the peo
ple who make a living out of the
mills; then the merchants and
others who do business with the
mil] folk. Finally, it presents a
problem to the state of Louisiana
and Mississippi—to the city of
New Orleans, which draws its
business and prosperity from
these people.
_ ■ ------
The railroads have an enorm
ous stake in this problem—for
lumber is a source of revenue;
indispensable at present to the
prosperity of a number of the
roads centering in this city. These
hundreds of miles of railroads in
Louisiana and Mississippi will
have to be abandoned if the cut
over lands along their routes are
not setled *by farmers.
Where are the farmers to
come from? It is foolish to sug
[igest that our own farmers
settle these lands. Most of them
are now blessed or cursed with a
far great acreage than they
can
properly farm. The profitable
farm in the future is a farm in
tensely cultivated. Only about
ten per cent of the lands of Lou
isiana and Missisippi are under
cultivation. We could easily
take care of nine times as many
farmers as we have in this sec
tion.
"Something is doing, of course.
But these efforts are not conduct
ed as they should be The news
papers, the banks, the business
men, the lawyers, doctors, teach
ers, preachers, the public author
ities and even the farmers them
selves do not understand this
problem as they should They
do not realize how it touches
them.
"The Itftnber people are not
associated and working with one
another on this question. They
have not the definite organized
support of the railroads and of

"No petty man and no great
man is going to take up and set
tie this problem alone. No sm-1
gle set of men and no single class
is going to meet the situation.
"Two or three of the great
leaders in the lumber industry
might help if they had the indus
try behind them. A half dozen
more leaders of other industries
might solve this problem if they
had public sentiment and bi si
liess interests solidly behind
them. The states of Louisiana
and Mississippi should move con
structively in this matter.—Lou

WEEPING JURORS.
Tears are common enough in
court rooms, but tears in the jury
box are something new. Women
jurors are responsible for this
Sentimental invasion. In a mur
der trial In Leavenworth, Kan.,
there were three women on the
jury. The two men on trial were
acquitted to the accompaniment
of profuse and joyous weeping on
the part of the feminine jurors.
Many a male jury has been
moved to compassion—often un
wise—by the tears of a paid de
fendant. And when men sworn
to administer justice are subject
to such frailty, it would be un
fair to find fault with women for
being carried away by their emo
tions when the situation is re
versed, and a man's life lies in
their hands. Women anyhow,
are no more sentimental than men
—they onlv show it differently.
Still, the incident is a bit dis
quieting to those who believe in
the administration of justice
without too much tempering of
merciful tears. It is notoriously
difficult to get any male jury to
pronounce a woman guilty of
murder. Now, if women are go
ing to sit on criminal juries gen
erally, will any man be found
guilty T—Tow n Talk .
