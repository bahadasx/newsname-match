GRAND JURY DEADLOCKED
Probably Will Be Disbanded at Once
MANLY RIPS THE SILENCER
OFF THE SILENT MR.HUGHES
BY BASIL M. MANLY
Noted Economic an d Political Expert.
WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OP CHARLES E. HUGHES ON THE
GREAT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL QUESTIONS THAT DETERMINE
THE WELFARE OF THE AMERICAN NATION AND THE LIBERTIES
OF THE CITIZENS OF AMERICA I
Since his nomination Hughes lias made a number of public statements,
but except fora clear-cut endorsement of a liijih protective tariff and souk 1
wry indefinite statements regarding the desirability of general welfare legis
lation, he has confined himself to the verbal exposition of his "Americanism."
This question <d' his real attitude is the one to which above all others the
American people should have an accurate unbiased answer. Not only is this
the most important campaign since the days of Lincoln, but there is an even
more Important reason why in the ease of Hughes the exact truth is vital.
The American people have, at the urgent Insistence of Theodore Roose
velt, chosen one president, William Howard Taft, from the federal bench and
later overwhelmingly repudiated him for his reaetioiiary nibaerviency to spe
ciaJ interest business. They are now asked, again by Ruosevelt, to choose an
other president from th<: federal beueh. The question must therefore be asked
—IS HUGHES ANOTHER TAFTI
Tell-Tale Record In Black and White
Fortunately the ANSWER ta this question can be given, free from all
bins, by an analysis of Hughes'record as a justice of the United stales Su
preme court. This is the best possible test, for during the six years since
Hughes was appointed to the supreme court by Taft, nearly every Important
MOOOtnic and social question has had to be considered, either directly or indi
rectly by this court.
The accuracy and validity of this test is apparent from the case of Taft. If
the American people had analyzed Taft's decisions as a federal judge, exalting
the rights of property above human rights, instead of accepting the encomiums
of Roosevelt upon Taft, there can be lit Lie doubt that there would have been no
Payne Aldrich tariff and no Ballinger scandal.
tn making this analysis of Hughes' record on the ■uprenM court, ] have
taken every case in which he delivered the opinion of the couri or dissented, all
of the cases in which lie concurred with the majority of the court against a dis
senting opinion, and the most important eaaei in which he participated in the
unanimous opinion of the court. Altogether 210 cases are involved, of which
Hughes personally wrote either majority or minority opinions in 14S.
In these cases his opinions on monopolies, labor, public lands, and all the
other big question! about which the people have been in conflict with privilege,
are clearly revealed.
They are the true index to his views, and must override any statements of
policy which he may make in the vote-getting excitement of the campaign.
What do these decisions show? They show that —
Attitude Progressive In Some Matters
During his entire six years on the supreme bench, Hughes dissented
from the majority of the court 29 times out of the 1412 opinions handed
down during that period Thus in 97 cases out of a hundred he stood on the
platform with the other justices. In four cases he wrote his own dissenting
opinion. In the other hundreds of cases he either went with the majority
or concurred in the dissent of some other justice.
The cases in which he handed down the Opinion of the majority (if the
court show him in a somewhat more progressive light. They show him as a firm
supporter of pure food legislation, a strong supporter of federal regulation, • a
constant foe of monopoly control through price-fixing, and a friend of state leg
islation in behalf of women and children.
On the other hand there are numerour cases, as I will show in detail in a
later article, where he concurred with the majority of the court.
You will be interested to known about the following:
Where did Hughes stand in the Danbury Hatters' case?
Where did Hughes stand in the case of the big western railroads against the
settlers?
Where did Hughes stand in the Standard Oil case?
Where did Hughes stand in the American Tobacco Trust case?
(Manly's second article on "Breaking the Silence of Silent Hughes" will
appear in this paper Monday.)
