APPAM CASE DECIDED
AGAINST GERMANS IN
PRIZE COURT ACTION
Norfolk, Va., July 29 -Federal Judge Waddill today de
cided the libel proceedings for possession of the captured
British1 Ijner Appam inf a vor of the English owners and
against the German prize crew which brought her here.
The court held that the German
government lost all legal claim to the
Appam and her cargo as Prizes of war
when Lieutenant Berg and his crew
on JasV February 1 brought into the"!
neutral 'waters of Hampton , Roads
with the Intention -of "laying tip" the
vessel Indefinitely.
. yThe court held further:
That the Prussian-American treaty
of 1799, renewed in 1828, does not
apply or control in tXe case so as to
guarantee the prize of the Appam in
the United States waters. , , -
The action of the: German prize
court in declaring the Appam a prize
while, the case was in litigation in the
United States courts has no effect on
the decision of the courts. ..---'"'
The Jurisdiction of the United States
courts in the case is established by a
long line of precedents
; '.'The court's conclusion, the de
cision reads, "is to that manner of
bringing the Appam into the waters
of the United States as yell as her
presence in these waters constitutes a
violation of the neutrality - of . the
United States r that she came In with
out bidding or permission; that she is
here in violation of the law; that 'she

The federal court's decision holding
for the British 'owners in the Appam
case confronts the United States with
deciding what to do with Lieutenant
Berg, and his prize crew which
brought in the ship after one of the
most thrilling captures in the sea
history of the war.; . .''.
Generally speaking, Lieutenant Berg
and his men are regarded as part of
German's naval force, and if that view
were carried 'out to its conclusion
they would have to be interred for
the war with the crews of the two
other Garmen commerce raiders,'

That Charles Sunigalskjan employe

company, who 'died in the isolation
hospital in"this city June 25, suppos
edly of erysipelas, in reality died from
injuries sustained during a battle with
bricks in the yards of the factory at
midnight, June 13, was the startling
claim made before Compensation Com
missioner Jward T. Buckingham to
day. This new development in the death
first came to light yesterday in the
hearing of Amelia Sunigalsrki, of Aus

redress under the compensation laws
of the state. .' v
Evidence wasintroduced by tho
London & Lancashire Indemnity com
pany to the effect' that the victim was
at work upon a'cfame of the company
in the' shops on June 13 when, the
lights went out . They allege, through
Attorney Henry Greenstein, that Peter
Kaspar, an electrician .still employed
by . the company, was called to fix
them. - i i '
In. 4 spirit of fun Sunigalski is al
leged to have thrown- some waste at
the electrician which was returned: A
continuation of the .battle, is reported
to have taken place in the yards at a
later hour when in an interchange of
bricks the victim was struck in. the
forehead with one thrown, it Is
claimed, by Kaspar. f y y v
The incident ended with the down
fall of Sunigalski who. was taken to
the hospital, then transferred to the
isolation hospital supposedly suffering
from erysipelas. Health Officer Dr.
