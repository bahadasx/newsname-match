PRINTING INDUSTRY MENACED
BY WORLD-WIDE PAPER FAMINE
The paper famine has reached a
point where it is seriously menacing
the newspapers of the country and
the printing business as a whole. The
American Review of Reviews, com
menting on the situation says:
"A commodity even so indirectly re
lated to the demands of war as pa
per is showing the prevailing ten
dencies to such a degree as seriously
to embarrass publishers. The higher
price of paper stock and the dif
ficulty in obtaining it at all in Eng
land was a chief factor in the dis
continuance in March of the London
Daily Standard, after a career of 60
years, for a considerable portion of
which it was the most important or
gan of the middle classes in England.
"In America the demand for paper
has been increasing for six months,
as a result of general business ac
tivity. At the same time supplies
used in its manufacture have been
decreased by war conditions, and in
some cases have almost been cut off.
"The supply of old rags is affected
by the cutting off of the importa
tions from the European peasantry
and by the demand for the making of
guncotton. The chemicals used in
bleaching the paper produced by sul
phuric acid and alum are being de
voured by the manufacturers of ex
plosives, while importations of lute
have fatten off until the price is
doubled. An embargo has been plac
ed on shipments of wood pulp from
.Norway and Sweden, while Canada
stopped access to her vast resources
some time ago.
. Newspapers Hard Hit
The newspaper publisher is, in
nf-fn' fu I ? it b - v war conditions in

the basic one of paper stock. Vir
tually everything going into the manu
facture of a daily newspaper has in
creased in price from 10 to 50 per

>'o Hope of Relief
1 Through an important bulletin Just
1 issued by a prominent concern which
manufacturers and distributes all
grades of paper it is learned that the
; causes of the present famine and in
i creasing cost of paper are such as to
! indicate no change for the better in
the near future. This bulletin states
that a large proportion of bleached
and unbleached sulphite and ground
! wood pulp used In the manufacture of
; paper has come from Europe- that the
; amount from the Central Empires
has been entirely stopped while the
| pulp from Norway and Sweden has
i been materially decreased. What is
now being received is costing double
| its former value.
Dyes, chemicals and paper ma
chinery and every other article which
goes into the manufacture of paper
j has increased anywhere from twice
| to ten times the price paid a year ago.
| Labor has increased twenty-five to
! fifty per cent. It is not believed there
] will be any chango until after the
I European war and then months will
• elapse before prices can be readjusted.
; The bulletin expresses the opinion that
I the paper mills will never be able to
go back on the old schedules and for
i that reason former prices will not
obtain.
As showing one or the causes of the
high cost of print paper, which is
seriously menacing the newspaper in
dustry, it is pointed out that the im
portation of sulphite which averaged
about 380,000 tons annually before the
war has dropped during the present
year from 28,880 tons in January to
3.952 tons in May.
Prices Going Up
All over the country newspapers
are advancing prices. The Milwau
kee Free Press, a morning newspaper
yesterday announces an advance from
1 to 2 cents in the price of the paper
for street sales. It attributes the ad
vance to the greatly increased cost of
print paper. The changed price will
be effective August 7.

ELIZABETH RADCLIFF AND ROT HINDERLEITER
Olney, 111., July 29.—Roy Hinderleiter, who is charged with having caused
the death of Elizabeth Itadclitt by injecting air into her veins, protests that
he is the innocent victim of circumstances, being drawn into the affair by the
girl who arranged for him to meet her to beg him to marry her and thus
save her from results for which he claims he was in no wise responsible.
Judge Whitcher, the boy's attorney, will introduce the suicide theory in
the trial and sees in the death of the girl a repetition of the self destruction
of Marian Lambert in the Orpet case. If not actual suicide, then he feels that
she had an operation performed upon herself and so came to her death through
her own act.
The chief evidence against the prisoner seems to rest in the fact that he
rode into town with her dead body in h,is arms.
Judge Whitcher has made the following statements:
"Roy Hinderleiter has no medical knowledge.
"His family was prominent; his father was wealthy. But he knew nothing
about women.
"When he met Elizabeth he was hypnotized by the girl's attraction. She
was the belle of the town. A dozen Olney youths fought her favors.
"Hinderleiter was handsomer than any of them and she finally chose him
for her sweetheart. But she continued tier meetings with other boys of tiie
town.
"With one of them she went out almost every night. Hinderleiter she saw
about once a week. When her indiscretions resulted in what seemed inevitable
disgrace it was Hinderleiter to whom she appealed.
He went to her. She died in his arms.
"He whipped his team to a breakneck speed to the Olney Sanatorium, and
in so doing disproved any guilty knowledge of the nature of her death."
On the other side, the prosecution brought out that Hinderleiter has boasted
of knowledge of birth control. The State has brought into the case the name
of Dr. George Weber, of West Salem.
Dr. Weber, according to State's Attorney Morris, sold Hinderleiter an in
strument which the boy used several times upon Elizabeth to prevent con
