Since his nomination Hughes has made a number

This question ot his real attitude is the one to which
above all others, the American people should have an
accurate, unbiased answer. Not only is this the most
important campaign since the days ot Lincoln, but there
is an even more important reason why, in the case of
Hughes, the exact truth is vital.

It Is hlmo up to George to see that
not more than four tires are used

In this George ha* failed. Altho
