Bath Beach
Springfield, m., July 29. Negro
citizens of Springfield planned today
to file injunction proceedings against
the park board of Springfield to com

here.
A swimming- pool in one of the local
parks was closed Thursday when three
negroes attempted to swim in it.
The plans for injunction proceed
ings followed a mass meeting last night
at which the radical negroes overrode
their more conservative fellow-citizens,
and voted to begin proceedings
at once, which, they predict, will eith
er gain permission for the negroes to
use the pools or will close them en

the face of advice from white citizens,
who, remembering the race riots of
190S, when seven negroes were lynch
ed, have counseled against it.

Berlin, July 29. Reviewing the po
litical events of the second year of the
war, the German foreign office has
given to The Associated Press a state
ment, which says in part:
''The world war was caused by Rus
sia's aggressive policy, supported by
France's policy of rtvenge. But it
was rendered possible solely by the
fact that Knglao subordinated to her
economic antagonism to Germany all
her other interests.
"Wht-reas Germany's enemies regard
i ouitf in order that they demand ter
ritorial aggrandizements at the cost t of
l'.i:Z-s like Russia who wants Con
stantinople and Calicia. like iYaore,
who desires Alsace-Lorraine and the
left Lank of the Rhine, and like Italy
who seeks Austrian territory th.-y
grudge Germany even that she strive
to develop herself economically in
peaceable competition, and they pro
nounce this an unpardonable sin
against the world's order of things.
"They are unwilling that Germany
should become great and strong, be
cause the other powers want to be the
economic masters of the world. Ter
ritorial and economical agrandizement
has united Germany's foes in a war
of distruction against us.
Second Year Reveals Aims.
"The second war year whose end is
now approaching has brought these
true aims of our opponents into clear
er light. In Russia this is openly ad
mitted, they having an understanding
with England and want Constantinople
as their war goal. In France there is
a war mad cry for Alsace-Lorraine.
"In England it is openly admitted
that Belgium was only a pretext to
justify England's participation in the
war, which was undertaken only from
self-interest.
"Germany must be destroyed. Ger
many shall never more raise her head
economically nor military.
"It is clear that the talk of a strug
gle of democracy against militarism
is only a catch word used by our ene
mies to create sentiment and to cloak
outwardly their real purpose of de
struction. Assuredly, there can be
no talk of a struggle for the main

one side sets out to destroy the enemy
completely, including the civilian pop

officials today looked for an early
agreement by General Carranza to sug
gestions for the extension of the pow
ers of an international joint commis
sion to settle border difficulties, which
accompanied the American acceptance
to Mexico's proposal for that form of
settlement. The state department
notified Carranza's ambassador here
last night that the commission plan
was satisfactory.
American officials do not want to
stop at discussion of problems deal
ing solely with bandit raids and the
presence in Mexico of United States
troops. They want to take up the
whole Mexican tingle, hoping the con
ferences may bring suggestions for
the reconstruction of Mexico on a firm
economical and financial basis.
It will be two weeks at least, offi
cials believe, before the commission
can meet. The state department will
insist that conferences be held within
the United States. Appointment of
American members will await Car

LINE OF PRECEDENTS
Rights Lost When Ship Was
Brought to "Lay Up"
Here Indefinitely.
Washington, July 29. The federal
court's decision holding for the British
owners in the Appam case confronts
the United States government with de
ciding what to do with Lieutenant Berg
and his prize crew, which brought in
the ship after one of tne most thrilling
chapters in the sea history of the war.
Generally speaking. Lieutenant Berg
and his men are regarded as part of
Germany's naval forces, and if that
view were carried out to its conclusion
they would hav ? to be interned for the
war for the crew of the other two Ger
man raiders, Prinz Itel Friedrich and
Kron Prinz Wilhelm, at the Norfolk
navy yard.
State department officials expect the
court's decision will be carried through
to the supreme court on appeal and
disposition of the German crew must
be decided while proceedings arc pend
ing. If appeal is taken the ship would
remain in custody of the federal court.
Court's Holding.
Norfolk, Va.. July 29 Federal Judge
Waddill today decided the libel pro
ceedings for possession of the captured
British liner Apam in favor of the Eng
lish owners and against the German
prize crew which brought her here.
The court held that the German gov
ernment lost all legal claim to the
Appam and her cargo as prizes of war
when Lieutenant Berg and his prize
crew on last February first brought
them into the neutral waters of Hamp
ton Roads, with the intention of "lay
ing up" the vessel indefinitely.
The court held further that the
Prussian-American treaty of 1799, re
newed in 1S2S, does not apply or con
trol in the case so as to guarantee the
prize crew asylum in United States
waters.
That the action of the German prize
court in declaring the Appam a prize
wLile the case was in litigation in the
United States courts has no effect on
the jurisdiction of the courts.
That the jurisdiction of the United
States courts in the case is established
by a long line of precedents including
several by the supreme court.

HOT AREA EXTENDS EASTWARD
Intense Snfferini? Continues in Con
gested District of Chicago
During Nights.
Washington, July 29. Forecasts of
weather for the week beginning Sun
day were announced today by the
weather bureau as follows:
Great Lakes region : Warm and gen
erally fair. There are no indications
of a break in the hot wave, which will
probably continue until at least the
latter half of the week.
Plains states and upper Mississippi
valley: Generally fair and continued
warm. There are no indications of a
material change in temperature.
Chicago, July 29. Slight hope was
held out by the local forecaster early
today for possible relief from the pres
ent heat wave, which is sweeping over
the central portion of the United
States, by Sunday night or Monday
morning. But for today no such en
couragement was forthcoming from
any source.
The government weather bureau at 7
o'clock this morning officially reported
the temperature at 85 or one degree
'warmer than it was at the same hour
I yesterday morning. Eighty-tive de-
grees was also the minimum for the
; night. The forcater said nothing had
j occurred to indicate that relief before
i tomorrow night was in prospect.
Suffering in the congested districts
of Chicago continued unabated during
the night.
Two more deaths attributed to ex
! cessive heat had been reported before
I 7 o'clock this morning, making the to-
tal for the 30 hours preceding, 72, and
since Thursday at midnight, S8.
Health department officials so far
have found their greatest burden to be
the heavy baby mortality.
Heat Area Extends.
Washington, July 29. Continuation
of the excessive heat now overspread
ing the central part of the country un
til tomorrow and its extension to the
north Atlantic coast states was fore
cast today by the weather bureau.
From the plains states eastward the
heat wave today held sway. Temper
atures ranged from 96 to 102 degrees
in those states, and in the Missouri
and Mississippi valleys and the upper

HUBBARD PETITIONER
Judge Norman Jones Gives
An Opinion When Over
ruling Demurrer.
Springfield, 111., July 29. Judge Nor
man L. Jons, in the circuit court here
today overruled the state's demurrer
to the bill for an injunction filed by
William A. Hubbard of Carrollton, to
restrain the commissioners in the con
struction of the Illinois deep water
way. Hubbard seeks to enjoin the stata
from issuing $5,000,000 worth of bonds
for a deep waterway, passed by the
last legislature.
The suit has held up for some time
the bond issue, which is a portion of
a $20,000,000 issue authorized by the
people at an election by Governor De
neen's administration, for the building
of a deep waterway from Lake Michi
gan across to the Mississippi river.
This would be a section of the pro
posed Lakes-to-the-Gulf deep water
way. Hubbard contends that the proposM
waterway is in no sense a deep water
way, as only an eight foot channel is
proposed.
Act Passed In 191.V
The decision involves an act of the
legislature providing for the issue of
$25,000,000 in boDda to build an eight
foot waterway from IiOckport to Utiea,
111. The act was passed in 1915. Hub
bard alleges an eight foot channel ia
not a "deep" v. ater vay.
Judge Jones holds, in overruling the
demurrer, that a deep waterway means
a H-foot channel, and not an S-foot
channel as provided by the legislature.
He reviews the history of agitation
and legislation for a deep waterway in
Illinois, and comes to the conclusion
"that the people, when they voted to
amend their state constitution, did so
with clear, positive and definite idea of
what the proposed deep waterway
was."
Deep Waterway Is 1 i Feet.
Legislature, congresn. commission
ers, and boards of engineers, says the
opinion, "have all declared that, a deep
waterway is a 14-foot waterway."
"The canal provided for by the act
of 1915 is most certainly not the canal
contemplated by the constitutional
amendment of 1908," concludes the
opinion.
GIVE NO REASON
FOR EXCLUSION
Washington, July 29. American Am
bassador Page at Ixndon today cabled

ain insists upon excluding from Eng

Kelly of New York, treasurer of the

Smith, and Mrs. Kelly. They will
leave England Monday on the Ameri
can liner Philadelphia.
Ambassador Page has been Inform
ed by the foreign office that the deci
sion to exclude the three Americans
was irrevocable. No reasons for ex
clusion of the Irish relief workers was
given by Ambassador Page who said
that during their detention at Liver
pool the British authorities hail per
mitted them to remain at a hotel
without being actually Imprisoned.
State department officials today still
hoped the exclusion order might Ihj
modified, however.
