WIFE OF LAWYER MURDERED
Fake Call Lures St. Joseph Prosecut
ing Attorney From Hl Home
While Slayer Worked.
Mrs. Osunr D. McDanlel. wife of tho
prosecuting attorney of Buchanan
county, was attacked and beaten nt
the family home, in St. Joseph, at mid
night, and died of her wounds at Ens
worth hospltat tho next morning.
The murder i of Mrs. McDaulel Is
supposed to havo boon the deed of
somo person or persons hor husband
had been active in piosccutlng, or of
a robber who wns found to be Insane
by n criminal court Jury several
months ago nnd committed to tho
state hospital In St. Joseph.. After
wards he escaped and slnco ho gained
his liberty ho has written tho proso
cutlng nttorney a number of threaten
ing letters. He made the demaud that
a jinan accused or ueing his accom
plice, and who lias not yet been tried,
bo released, under penally of McDan
lei's death.
Bloodhounds which took tho scent
at tho McDanlel homo, followed a zig
zag course to a South Eighth si root j
roomlnc house, nnt far from n s.ilnnn '
to which her husband had been called
prior to tho murderous attack upon
hor.
At 11:30 o'clock McDanlel received
a telephone call to go downtown to a
saloon, whero it was said that his
brother was In trouble. Ho took his
motor car from tho garage, and pro
ceeded to the placo with all possiblo
haste. Upon reaching the saloon ho
wes Informed that his brother had not
been thero and that no message had
been telephoned from there.
Suspecting a plot he hurried homo
and as he approached the house, sev
eral shots were fired at him from be
hind a tree. Ho responded with his
revolver and saw a man run away In
tho darkness. .McDanlel was not in
jured and does not know whether ho
hit his assailant.
Upon entering tho house McDanlel
found lila wife on tho bed crushed and
bleeding and unconscious. Ho called
a doctor nnd she was sci.t to the hos
pital, whore he also for a time was in
a state of collapse over the condition
of his wife.
TO SHOW MISSOURI IN FILMS
Movement Under Way to Depict His
torical Events of State by Use
of Motion Pictures.
. Tho history of Missouri, from the
dato of its discovery, In 1511, down to
tho present time, is to be depicted In
motion pictures. Already a Kansas
City corporation has been organized,
and about halt of the first of a series
of twelve films has been taken.
The work Is under tho supervision
and censorship of the Missouri Valley
Historical Society, which held Its quar
terly meeting at the Westport library
recently. To put Missouri history
down In graphic form In preparation
for tho celebration commemorating
tho 100th anniversary of tho admission
of the state, which is to come in four
years, is tho object of tho films.
"Two Girls aud One Bonnet" Is tho
name of tho first film, which is now
being taken and It will probably be
finished by August 1. Interwoven
with a story, tho history of this stato
from 1850 to 1SQ0 Is Bhown. Scenes
already havo been taken around the
(jld John It. Wornall home, at Sixty
second street and Wornall road, which
was used as a military hospital during
tho Civil war, and around the old Gar
diner Lathrop home, at Forty-fifth and
Walnut streets.
Tho Missouri Valley Historical So
ciety has pledged a $1,000 loan to as
sist In carrying on tho work of mak
ing tho films. Of this amount $2,700
has been subscribed and $100 Is pro
mised by October 1, leaving $900 tho
society still must collect by subscrip
tion. Tho films will bo shown in
schools all over tho stato.

ENATOU Kenyon of
Iowa, has been waging
n great tight In behalf
of the American hog,
which It seems passing
strange, In view of the
amazing array of facts
which the senator has
presented, has not been
undertaken by anybody
before. The American Investment In
the hog buslnesH represents some S700,
000,000, the number of hogs on the
farms last year being 01,000,000; yet
there is no other animal which suf.
fers such tremendous loss from dls-
ease through bug cholera.
It Is estimated that tho loss of
pork last year through tills disease
reached the enormous total of 05,000,
000 pounds, or ten pounds of meat for
every man, woman, nnd child in tho
United States a net loss of some $00,'
000,000. Moreover, this great loss Is
by no means exceptional. The loss
for the year following tho one thus
estimated will lie greater, it Is bo
Heved, by perhaps $20,000,000 or ?2o,-
uoo.ooo, while ns fur hack as 1S07 tho
loss was stilted by the federal bu
reau of iiiilnnil Industry to be not far
rrom 5100,000,000 for that year.
The strange thing Is that the cause
of hog cholera 1ms been definitely de
termined and a speelllc, an almost In
fallible remedy, 1ms been discovered
but that little has been done toward
applying It.
When hog cholera strikes a drove
of hogs it usually sweeps through it
like a whirlwind, killing in n period
of ID or 20 days from So to 03 per
cent nt the drove. When tho remedy,
or rather preventive treatment Is ap
plied, tho loss Is reduced to less than
1 per cent.
In presenting these facts, Senator
jveiiyou was principally quoting our
own department of agriculture, which,
If It has done mi) thing, lius studied
the American hog; so that his author
ity may bo considered exceptionally
good. J he Iowu senator won out
handsomely, for congress passed his
mil appropriating S.iOO.OOO to enable
the secretary of agriculture to pro
ceed with the stumping out of the dis
ease, and the work has been begun
with enthusiasm by the department of
agriculture.
An absolute preventive has been
found for tho universal hog cholera,
a serum developed by Dr. M. Dorset,
a practical scientist In tho depart
ment of agriculture, which as surely
prevents cholera in hogs us tho bet
ter known serum in typhoid or the
vaccine of smallpox, or antitoxin of
diphtheria prevents those discuses in
tho human family. Doctor Dorset has
patented his priceless process and has
presented It to the people of tho Unit
ed States. It has been tried out Willi
the most gratlfjlng results.
Control of hog cholera by the use of
the Dorset serum, as practiced by the
department of agriculture, and the
moro progressive of the Img-ralslng
states, presents ono of tho most In
teresting examples of tho results of
sclentlllc research. The hog cholera
genu Is so small us to be Invisible un
der tho most powerful microscope.
That It Is a germ lias boon determined
only by actual experiments in iu
uoculnting healthy hogs with tho

Philadelphia schoolchildren, by con

In u hospltat for consumptives,
blood of cliolorii-dlseasDd nnlinnls.
The antlcholera sorum which Is In
jected into healthy lings to render
them immune Is obtained by taking
a naturally Immune hog, or one which
has recovered from cholera, and In
jecting Into Its circulation some blood
from u hog suffering from it had case
of cholera. Outwardly this treatment
aflVcts tlie Immune hog only slightly;
It does not give It cholera, but It
makes the animal still more highly
Immune hyper-Immune. This hyper
Immune hog Is then bled several times
from Its tall and llnnlly from the
carotid artery which results in tho
death of the animal. From the large
amount of blood thus obtained the
antlcholera serum is made, and when
this Is Injected Into an ordinary hog
It renders it cholera proof without,
however, alTecting the iinimal. The
Immunity lasts only a few weeks, hut
an Interesting and highly important
phase of tho work whereby tho hog
Is made Immune against cholera for
the rest of its life consists In the In
jection of some blood from n cholera
sick hog.
This double injection, then, keeps
the animal from having hog cholera
and nt the same time makes him per
manently Immune. The sumo results
tire nlTected, If tho iiog Immediately
after being Innoculated with the
scrum, Is exposed to other hogs suffer
ing from hog cholera. All of which
Indicates the fact that a large amount
ot Direful experimentation has been
undertaken by tho bureau of animal
Industry of the department of agri
vulture. With such a devastating disease as
hog cholera prevalent throughout tho
entire country It follows that many
remedies nnd ot Into many hog cholera
serums have appeared upon tho mar
ket. The frauds and grafters have
reaped a golden harvest through the
sale of their worthless and even dan
gerous concoctions. In order to pre
vent tho maiiufucturo and sale of
these fake remedies, a hill has been
introduced prohibiting thn Interstate
shipment of any hog cholera serums
which nro not approved by the depart
ment of agriculture.
Whero tho government serum has
been used, however, the records show
that the percentage of loss Is almost
nothing loss than 1 per cent. Kven
In badly ntlllcted droves tho treatment
has Mixed u large proportion of tho
hogs and lias many tluieu paid for It
self.
Not only does hog rholern cause the
direct loss of it billion pounds of pork,
but beef production Is tremendously

suiting profits Inrgely depend upon
successful hog raising. In Iowa, Mis
souri, Illinois and other great hog
ralslng states, the hogs follow the
cattle; they eat after. the cattle. Com
bined they bring the farmer n good
revenue. With hog raising left out.
tho cattle In these states can be
grown only nt a loss.
Probably no blight or disease with
"lcli the-fanucr hii.Tt'o contimd, and
ho lias many. Is so absolutely discour
aging as hog cholera. Its devastation
Is almost complete. With a drove of
100 or perhaps 1,000 prime hogs Just
ready for the market, he has almost
the feel of the money $1,000 or $10,
000 within his hand. They nro
healthy mid fat, a sight good to look
upon. Then n hog on an adjoining
farm rubs snouts with one of them,
through the fence, nnd before the week
Is but half tho hogs of the drove nro
Infected, and the chances nro .that
In another week, Instend of 100 hogs,
there will bo less than a dozen strag
glers. Even with n good bank ac
count. It takes somo nerve for this
particular former to start all over
again; the chances aro that he will
quit tho hog business.
All the precautions of sanitation and
cleanliness may be of little avail In
combating cholera. An entire drove
of a thousand hogs may be swept nwny
from tho germs carried on the hoots
of a farmhand who has visited somo
distant furm, whllo dogs, turkey buz
zards, crows, etc., may transmit the
disease.
There are Just two things to he
done; first, stop tho sale ot fake and
dangerous nntlcholera serums, and sec
ond to supply hog raisers with the
Dorset serum. Hog raisers are will
ing to pay tho cost ot Inoculation.
The trouble has been that there Is not
enough serum to supply the demand,
and tho farmers have ued danger
ous substitutes. To insure n $15 hog
by Inoculating him nt n cost of 23
cents Is good business, nnd when the
government manufactures serum on a
liberal scale, this cost will bo consid
erably reduced. With hog eholcrn tin
der control, not only would wo have
moro pork, but more beef. If hog
cholera can be abolished, ns It should
be by means of tho Dorset serum, tho
I'nltod States In two years can be re
stored to Us old place ns the greatest
meat exporting nation In the world.
The appropriation of half n million
dollars In the Kenyon law for the
stamping out of cholera Is nn authorl
znllon to do tho most practical work
possible toward Increasing tho nation
al meat supply.
