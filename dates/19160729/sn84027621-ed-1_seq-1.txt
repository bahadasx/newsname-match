THE PHI
Practical Manner of Submitting a
Good Roads Bond Issue
' to the People
The following editorial from the
Road Maker, the monthly journal de
voted to the practical ' problems of
highway transportation, points out
the advantages of the Polk county,
Fla., ' method of submitting a r good
roads bond issue to the voters. It is
this plan that is proposed for Marion
county.
The editorial is as follows:
Polk county, Florida, voted a $1,
500,000 bond issue June ,2nd with
which to build a system of hard roads.
There is nothing particularly remark
able "about'iiiis fact; because a large
number of counties In - the United
States ' have voted sums of equal or
greater amount, but the manner in
which Polk county did it is entitled
to study.
Following the plans adopted this
year in Pinellas county, "Florida, Polk
county let the contracts for all of the
217 miles of hard-surfaced road in
cluded in the system to be built, be
fore they asked for the money with
which to build them. Under this plan
the voters knew just exactly what
they were going to get and just ex
actly what they were going to pay for
every bit of it.
The manner in which they respond
ed to this statement is shown by the
vote and by the fact' that in one pre
cinct, where 110 voteS were cast, not
a single negative vote was registered.
About the same time, San Diego
county, California, submitted a bond
issue for $2,201,000. The amount was
based upon a thorough estimate of
what they could use and of what they
had left of their bonding power, and
no plans were given to the people to
show just exactly where the money
was going. Even the commercial or
ganizations of San Diego opposed the
bond issue on this ground.
The people of San Diego county , are
not less progressive than those of
other counties in that state or in Flor
ida. They simply want to know what
they are going to get far the money,
ana they nave a right to kno-jjv.
What is true in California and Flor
ida is equally true in Illinois, Iowa,
Missouri, Wisconsin or ' Minnesota.
The farmers of these states are not
one bit less progressive or less appre
ciative of the value of good roads than
the people of California or Florida.
Of course, in this great black dirt
belt, where nature has done much to
ward making every one rich who was
fortunate enough to get here early, at
tention is not so easily directed to the
one thing lacking as it is in a com
munity less favored with natural re
sources. . - " "
California, Colorado or Florida de
pend quite largely for their revenues
upon the tourists, fd roads become,
under modern transportation meth
ods, a very vital factor in entertain
ing the visitors and in making them
satisfied with the country. If Hlinoi3
had very little besides climate and
scenery, roads would become an ab
solute necessity at the present time.
As it is, they can get by without
them, and, therefore, it is harder to
focus attention-oh this great eco
nomic problem.
But this state is thoroughly wide
awakeHo the proposition now, and if
we could submit, in any county in H
linois, a comprehensive system of
roads under -contract for a specific
amount, with bonds deposited with the
county authority for the faithful per-
formance of said contract, and giving

Senate Wants Him to Ask Clemency

(Associated Press)
Washington, July 29. The Senate

unfavorably on the resolutions re

The Senate by a vote-of 46 to 19

FLORIDA REGIMENT MAY
GO TO THE FRONT
Jackonville, July 29. -Although
Lieutenant-Colonel Wolf e refuses to
give the exact date or destination he
admits that the Second Florida regi
ment will in all probability leave for
the" border -'next week. The first field
hospital of the Ninth Division com
manded by Major Raymond t3. Turck,
will leave next Thursday, if addition
al equipment arrives in time. It will
be the first field hospital in the South
to move to the border, itjis believed
by commanding officers here.
The general opinion at Black Point
i3 that the regiment will go to El
Paso.
to the people a fair distribution of the
advantages of the system, we do not
believe that there is a community in
the state vthat would not buy such, a
system of roads; and buy it because
they were satisfied that the invest
ment would be a .very profitable one.
But the time is long past when they
are going to permit of very much
guesswork about it.
Our efficient state highway depart
ment, in co-operating with the county
supervisor, brings the proposition of
a county road system almost to the
Florida standard before submitting it
to the people," but the general public
has not had sufficient experience with
engineers' estimates to realize how
accurate they can be made, if the en-
giner is competent and honest. It is
not, however, nearly as convincing an
argument as the real "honest-to-God"
binding contract contingent upon their
saying "yes," and it isn't a very long
step from the system we have now to
letting the contract for the roads and
then submitting to the people the
proposition do you want them at this
price, or do you not?
Inasmuch as the public can buy
roads marked in plain figures without
any. great amount of additional work
or expense, we believe they are fully
justified in demanding that they be
permitted to do so. Offer Iowa or II
linois communities roads that are
worth the money on reasonable terms
of payment, and you can sell them so
fast that it will be a problem to find
men enough and equipment enough to
build them.

OCALA, FLORIDA, SATURDAY JULY, 29, 1916
AGIST THE
(Associated
Norfolk, Va., July 29. Federal
Judge Waddill has; rendered a decis
ion in the libel proceedings for pos
session of the captured British liner
Appam in favor of the English own
ers and against the German prize
crew. The judge held that the Ger
man government lost all j legal claim
to the Appam and her cargo as war
prizes when Lieutenant Berge brought
the vessel here February 1st with the
intention of "laying up" the vessel in
definitely in an American port.
PRUSSIAN AMERICAN TREATY
DOESNT APPLY
The court held that the Prussian-
American treaty of 1828 doesn't ap
ply or control in the case so as to
guarantee the prize crew asylum in
United States' waters. The action of
the prize court in declaring the Ap
pam a prize, while the case was in
litigation in the courts of the United
States doesn't effect the court's juris
diction and jurisdiction established by
a long line of precedents.
The decision said the Appam enter
ed American waters in violation of
the neutrality of the United States
and is unable to leave for lack of a
crew and must to all intents and pur
poses be treated as abandoned and
stranded and the owners are entitled
to restitution of their property. The
decision also declared that a prize
vessel cannot legally be brought into
neutral waters without a convoy. .
PUZZLED ABOUT THE CREW
Washington, July 29. The decision
of Judge Waddill in holding the Ap
pam for her British owners confronts
the United States with the question of
what to do with the prize crew. Gen
erally speaking they are regarded as
part of the German naval forces and
if that view is carried out they would
have to be interned for the war with
the crews of the German warship at
Norfolk. : V
'i State department officials expect
the decision to be carried to the su
preme .court.
MILITARY TRAINING
IN HIGH SCHOOLS
The War Department Will Supply
Instructors and Equipment
: to the Cadets
Washington, July 29. The war de
partment is now prepared to be of
great assistance , in organizing high
school cadets in every town and city
in Florida where as many as 200
pupils over 14 years of age will con
sent to take military Instruction.
Secretary of War Baker has at
tached his signature to regulations
which make effective the legislation
on , this subject recently passed by
Congress. Under these regulations it
will be possible to establish the cadet
system in any Florida city "without
expense to the city.
The war department will furnish
one instructor for every 200 cadets
and, in addition, will issue to every
cadet free of charge a uniform con
sisting of campaign hat, olive drab
coat, breeches and leggings, shoes and
two rifles one the ordinary army
rifle and the other a twenty-two cali
ber rifle for indoor "practice. In every
case it will be optional with the boys
to decide whether or not they wish to
become cadets.
The war department now has 300
retired army officers who are avail
able to be sent out as instructors and
with 200 non-commissioned officers
the department can muster 500 officers
to be sent to towns and cities that or
ganize high school cadets.

OVERHAULING THE
PLUMBING ORDINANCE
Many Citizens Consult with the Com
mittee Regarding the Measure :
The judiciary committee of the
council" was in session at the city hall
yesterday afternoon and again last
night hearing citizens who had objec
tions to the proposed plumbing ordi
nance, which covers the city's new
$100,000 . sewerage system. Several
changes in the ordinance have been
made as a result of the hearings, and
the measure will be , re-drafted by the
city attorney, and submitted to coun
cil Tuesday night. . .
Appearing against the ordinance as
originally drafted and passed by coun
cil were Col. R. F. Rogers, . L. N.
Green and R. C. Loveridge. The dis
cussion waxed very warm at times
during the afternoon and evening. The
main change in the measure, mkde as
a result of objections, covers tenement
house. As changed, the ordinance
will permit a battery of toilets, with
one toilet for every ten persons, for
as many tenement houses in a group
as meet with the approval of the
plumbing inspector; with one water
meter to the battery.
Mr. Green objected strongly to be
ing required to have a plumber install
the pipes connecting the house with
the sewer main.' He would have the
privilege of having this work dijne by
cheaper labor.
It is pointed out that, even before
the objections were made, the plumb
ing ordinance drafted for Ocala is
more lenient than any similar ordi
nance in the state.
HAMPSHIRE AND DUROC
BREEDS PREFERRED
Further testimony as to the merits
or tne iampsmre nog, which has been
adopted for the boys pig club work in
this county is given in a letter from
the Moultrie Packing company, of
Moultrie, Ga to R. W. Blacklock,
county demonstration agent. The let
ter reads in part:
"In reply to your inquiry will say
that we like the Duroc and Hampshire
breed of hogs better than any other.
Of course there may be some that are
just as good, but our preference is for
these two breeds."
COMMISSION MAY CONFER
WITH CARRANZA
(Associated Press) .
Washington, July 29. The United
States last night informed Carranza,
in a note, that the United States was
ready to submit to a joint commis
sion the task of seeking a solution of
the border problems, and that as soon
as he had finally accepted the United
States would appoint its commission
ers and begin joint arrangements with
Carranza for them to meet the Car
ranza commissioners.
The United States suggested, how
ever, that the commissioners try to
settle the entire question rather than
be confined, as Carranza suggested
first, to the drawing up of a protocol
regarding reciprocal crossing of the
border, determining the origin of ban
dit incursions and agreeing on the re-
evacuation of the American forces.

How Guardians of Liberty Worked in

The Guardians of Liberty fought
W. V. Knott, F. M., Hudson, Ion L.
Farris and F. A. Wood.
'They fought J. C. Luning for treas
urer.
They fought Henry Clay Crawford
for secretary of state.
They fought W. N. Sheats.
They fought R. C. Dunn, A. S. Wells
and Mr. Ford.
They sent out letters, urging their
ignorant followers not to vote for a
second choice under any circum
stances. ,
As proof, and proof sufficient to
make all good democrats disgusted, i3
the following letter sent out to their
members before the primary. . True
democratic newspapers are respect
fully urged to publish the letter. Here
it is:
Green Cove Springs, Fla., May 30.
Dear Brother: The following candi
dates for the various offices are
worthy of our-support and vote and
the information should be given to
every member and we should do all in
our power to roll up as big vote as
possible for each. Get busy and elect
men to office who are "no less loyal to
the principles of the order" than we
ar: .
For United States Senate, Park
TrammelL (All the other candidates
are opposed to our principles).
Fcr state school superintendent, J.
J. Kelly (P). (Sheats is opposed to
our principles and to our movement).
For attorney general, T. F. West.
For justice supreme court, Jefferson
B. Browne. (He is definitely commit

For state treasurer, J. S. Griner (P
For state treasurer, J. S. Griner,
(P).
For railroad commissioner, S. A.
Bryan, (P).
F6r comptroller, neither candidate
is committed to our principles.
For commissioner of"" agriculture,
McRae js the only candidate, and he
was openly and determinedly in favor
of disfranchising us.
For secretary of state, Mr. Jordan
appears the least objectionable.
In order to get full value of our
votes we should not vote a second
choice. Your second choice may help
to defeat your favorhe candidate.
W. V. Knott and Ion L. Farris, two
of the candidates for governor, stated
in the newspapers that we should all
be disfranchised. Knott tries to deny
it now, but it is in black and white.
Nat Bryan and Perry Wall were of
the same opinion. No good citizen
should give either his first or second
rhoice vote to a man who wanted to
deprive him of the right to vote.
Let us make the next few days
count for God, Home and Country.
