SHOOlGfAS
AGAINST IAW
British Stirred Over Execu
tion of Captain Fryatt by
Germans.
London, July 29.—The Captain
Fryatt case calls attention to the Ger
man prize regulations, which provide
that under circumstances similar to
the capture of the Brussels, merchant
men are to be treated as prisoners of
war. An appendix to those regulations
Issued June 22, 1914, reads:
"If an armed enemy merchant ves
sel offers armed resistance to the right
of vislt'&ta search and capture, this
Is to be broken down by all possible
means. *'The enemy government is re
sponsible for any damage thereby
caused to the ship, its cargo and pas
sengers. The members of the crew
are to be treated as prisoners of ,war.
Passengers are to be liberated unless
It is proved they have taken part in
the resistance. In the latter case,
they are to be proceeded against in
accordance with the extraordinary
martial law procedure."
The first intimation of the trial of
Captain Fryatt was called to the at
tention of the foreign office by press
reports on July 18 to the effect that
he was to be tried as the result of
Vftndinfc on him a watch containing an
Inscription reciting his efforts to ram
a. German submarine.
From inquiries made of the owners
tof the steamship Wrexham, which
Captain Fryatt commanded when the
alleged incident took place, the for
eign office' learned the captain had
-*?lth him neither a watch nor a letter
to the effect that he had attempted
•to ram a submarine with him when
'he was captured. Therefore, officials
here state the charge must have been
fcased on press reports.
Discussing the case with the As
sociated Press, Baron Newton, under
secretary for foreign affairs, who, dur
J.ln* the conversation was summoned
jtd Foreign Secretary Grey's office for
a conference on the subiect said:
"On the face of the detailed re
ports received, the execution of Cap
tain Fryatt seems to be worse than
Sthe Cavall case. It is an extremely
[grave incident, the importance of
Nwhich It would be difficult to exagger
ate. It must be borne in mind that

German submarines were attacking

WiE RESIGNS
MAN TO GIRL
'Just Suppose" Letter Re
sults in Divorce Being
Granted.
Chicago, July 29.—Recently a "Just
suppose" letter came to Mrs. Dorothy
McCormick of this city and she gave
a little cry of surprise when she read
the address on the envelope, "because
it was from her husband, from whom
she had been separated. It did not
say that he was coming back. Instead
it presented to her a very difficult
problem—a problem as old as matri
mony and as old as sin. This is what
the letter said:
"Suppose—1-remember, just suppose
—that there was a girl here in a deli
cate condition. Also suppose that the
child belongs to me, and that the girl
is 18 years old, rather good looking,
without parents, with no one to help
her—as most of her friends turned
her down when they found out she
was in trouble.
"Suppose she didn't know I was
married, that she trusted me, think
ing I would marry her. Suppose I
told her I was married, and the cir
cumstances and that I also told her
I would see her through her trouble
and give her the support I could and
help her to make a living for herself
and her child. Suppose I even loved
the girl and would do anything for
her despite any circumstances.
"Suppose she was everything a man
could wish for in the line of a wife.
Suppose I have sworn on the bible
and on my honor as a gentleman to
see her through, and suppose I am
going to do it.
"I. want to know what action you
would take—what you would do. I
canot say any more until I hear from
you. But try and remember this—
we can never live together again.
"I remain,
—Glen McCormick,
•"-Detroit, Mich."
That was the letter. That was the
problem.-:that Mrs. McCormick fated.
She divorced her husband yesterday.
He is free to marry the girl.
SONG APPLIED TO
THE PRESENT WAR
Athens, July 29, (Correspondence
of The Associated Press)—A dramatic
moment marked a militarv horse
show given recently in the stadium.
The Jumping and riding exhibitions
were over. The white-skirted
evzones had marched impressively
past the royal tribune, and two regi
ments of soldiers were drawn up be
fore King Constantino and Queen
Sophie to sing Greek folk songs.
Several songs passed pleasantly
enough. Then there came one about
the exploits of Constantino Palelogue,
Emperor of Byzance.
Even to those who could not under
stand the words there was something
stirring in the martial lines. And
when a thousand voices rang out:
"The Warrior King Unsheathes His
Sword," suddenly the whole mass
blackening the gleaming marble of
the stadium rose as of one impulse,
applauding crying out: "Yes! Tes!
The Warrior King Will Unsheath His
Sword!" and craning their necks to
see their sovereign, their warrior king
of today-
Constantino I. sat erect and rigid
in his smart, white uniform—a hand
some, martial figure himself. He
heard but he made no movement. His
left hand grasped the hilt of his
sword. But the sword remained
unsheathed, and- the song went on.
Only when the king, had gone and the
crowd was pouring down the street
that runs .in front of the royal resi
dence, some man shouted that it was
shameful -that the applause for the
king had been paid for by German
money.
A crowd gathered instantly. There
was a shot. An officer cut the man
who had shouted in the head with his
sabre. A score of secret police sprang
up in a moment and the offender (not
the officer) was hustled off through
an unfinished building, down back
streets, to Jail.
BLACK RUST FOUND.

the course outlined in the minority

With eight big automobile races on
the program as the big feature, the
closing day of the Grand Porks fair
promises to be the biggest in- years.
The race program began promptly at
2:30 o'clock this afternoon when the
trials were run off, but long before
that time people commenced pack
ing the grand stand and bleachers.
At noon, automobile parties begat!
arriving at the grounds and taking
advantageous positions around the
track. The inner field also commenc
ed to fill rapidly, and at 1 o'clock the
indications were that a record-break
ing crowd would witness the closing
day's events.
Track is Prepared.
During the morning a corps of
workers were kept busy placing cal
cium chloride on the .track to lay the
dust. Previous to this, the track had
been heavily sprinkled, so that there
will be little if any dust during the
races. The track, for 10 feet on each
side, has been roped off, so that there
will be no danger of accidents, if a
car should head through the fence.
Drivers Entered.

GERMANS LOSE
APPAM ACIION
IN US.COURT
Judge Hands Down De
cision in Favor of British
Owners of Ship.
NO ASYLUM RIGHT
FOR WAR PRIZE
Appeal Will Probably be
Taken, Teutonic Consul
Declares.
Norfolk, Va., July 29.—Federal
Judge Waddlll today decided the libel
proceedings for the possession of the
captured British liner Appam in favor
of the English owners and against the
German prize crew which brought her
here.
The court held the German govern
ment lost all legal claim to the Ap
pam and cargo as prizes of war when
Lieutenant Berg and his prize crew
last February first brought them into
the neutral waters of Hampton Roads
with the intention of "laying up" the
vessel Indefinitely.
No Convoy.
The court decided a prize vessel
cannot legally be brought into neutral
water without a convoy. The Appam
was brought in under her own steam,
after the capture by the German raid,
er Moewe last January 17.
The court held the Prussian-Amer
ican treaty of 1799, renewed in 1828,
did not apply or control in the case
so as to guarantee the prize crew an
asylum In the United States waters.
The court also disposed of The
Hague treaty recently made, holding
It not applicable inasmuch as Great
Britain had never accepted it, but
pointed out that the attitude of the
American delegates to trie convention
was shown by the rejection of article
28 which would have guaranteed a
prize vessel asylum in neutral wa
ters.
Appeal likely.
Attorneys were notified that the

olas presiding at the great Russian
war council which was held shortly
before the Russian advance. The

sult of tho plans laid by this notable
gathering of th« empire's military

Judge Landis Scores Hospit
al in Opinion in Federal
Court.
Chicago, July 29.-
Margaret Ryan,
a Canadian working girl, was declared
by Judge K. M. Landis of the United
co^1r.t.to1b6
the
mother
of a year old child claimed also by
Mrs. Anna DoIIie Ledgerwood Mat
ters, and given the custody of the in
fant.
The decision came at the close of
a day of dramatic court Incidents
which included the hurried rounding
up of material witnesses in automo
biles and ended a contention which
has resulted in a half dozen lawsuits.
Previous to the opening of the final
day of the federal court hearing suits
against Mrs. Matters charging foist
ing a spurious heir on the probate
court and perjury were dismissed in
the state court*
"Where the question of maternity
is involved, the real mother will not
stand mute," Judge Landis said in
announcing his decision.
The decision followed a speech in
which the Judge bitterly censured the
Misericordla hospital at Ottawa, Ont.,
the sisters in charge, and certain at
tendants who gave perjured testimonv
concerning the birth of the baby. It
was in this hospital that Mrs. Mat
ters, widow of a banker, claimed to
have given birth to the child and
whose attendants at first supporting
her claim, repudiated their testimony
and in later hearings declared that
Margaret Ryan was its mother and
that it was taken from her and given
to the Chicago widow.

CAUSE OF RIOTS
New Tork, July 29.—At the end of
a day of almost continuous rioting in

dered more than 3,000 men to re
main on reserve duty.
Despite the serious rioting of the
day there were few arrests and no
casualties. Strikers and their sym
pathizers, according to the police, de
railed thirty cars and badly damaged
?w
m.an^
more. In most cases, bv
the time the police arrived the rioters
had dispersed.
Both sides reported to the police
that gunmen are being employed.
The police have recognised several
gangsters among the strikebreakers.
TARIFF COMMISSION
MAY TOUR EUROPE
Washington, July 29.—One of the
first tasks assigned to the tariff com
mission to be created by the pending
revenue bill may be a tour of Euro

ents. to study the effect of the war on
industrial and trade relations of the
Lnited States and to report particu
larly information which might aid in
the adjustment of tariff duties to meet
conditions likely to follow the re
storation of peace.
Administration officials let it be
known that the plan to send the pro
posed commission abroad was being
seriously considered in making pub
lic today a letter from President Wil
son to Samuel M. Hastings of Chica
go, president of the Illinois Manufac
turers' association, in reply to a tele
gram from the association suggesting
that a special commission be appoint
ed to visit all foreign nations to in
vestigate economic conditions and
trade opportunities. The president
said whether the moment to act upon
the suggestion was opportune was
open to serious question, but that
when circumstances Justified it he in
tended to take advantage of the rev
enue bill's provision for investigation
by the tariff commission.
