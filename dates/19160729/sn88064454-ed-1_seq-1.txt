half and five feet of red joints, and
the leaves reaching a height of ten

lHae You A Ladder?
If your home should catch fire
today, or worse, tonight, have you
a ladder handy to get on the roof?
Many of the files in the country
start from sparks setting fire to the
roof; a bucket or two of water
would extinguish the blaze and
prevent the destruction of the
house, but how to get on the roof
is often no trifling matter. Every
one owning a home should have a
goodl ladder and keep it in a conve
nient place for use in case of fire.
