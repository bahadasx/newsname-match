GERMAN REPORT.
Berlin, July 28. —Attacks by two
Russian army corps on German posi
tions east of Corodische, in the Baran
ovichi region were delivered yesterday
but faljed to gain ground, the war of
fice announced today. The battle Is
•till in progress.
The Russians have resumed their
attack southeast of Vladimir Volynski
in southern Volhynia and succeeded in
penetrating Gen. Von Linsingen's lines
northeast of Sviniuchy but are being
vigorously counter attacked by the
Germans.
Strong British attacks against the
German positions in Foureaux wood, iu
the Somme region, broke down yester
day under the German fire, says the
official statement issued today at Ger
man army lieadquarters.
WAR SUMMARY.
Desperate efforts by the Germans to
retain a foothold in Delville wood on
the Somme front have failed, accord
ing to the London war office, which to-'
day announces that the entire wood is
!n British possession. This position
was defended by the famous Branden
burgers. Delville wood immediately
adjoins Longueval, a portion of which
Is still in German possession.
The success of the British announc
ed today is expected greatly to facili
tate their efforts to clinch their hold
on Longueval and advance along tho
road to Bapaume. This highway runs
through the village.
The fighting for Delville wood is
said by observers to have been vir
tually the fiercest of the war. On the
1,000 yard front during one period
three shells a minute fell on every
yard.
The battle at Verdun is still raging
with violence. Paris reports a Ger
man effort to attack at the Thiaumont
work northeast of the citadel, which
was checked. The clearing of German
trenches at Auberive, in the Cham
pagne, by a Russian reconnoitering
party is also announced.
The Russian advance directed at
Brody in northeastern Galicia is con
tinuing successfully, Petrograd an
nounces. The Russians are hammering
at the Austrian lines in the Slonevka
region, from which river Gen. Sakhar
off's forces have driven the Austrians
back to the Boldurovka, a branch of
the Styr, which runs through Brody.
The Russian movement threatens to
compel the evacuation of Brody and
facilitate an advance toward Lemberg.

INFORMAL ASSURANCES GIVEN
THAT WILSON'8 APPEAL WILL
NOT BE FRUITLESS.
Washington, D. C., July 28.—Infor
mal assurances that Austria-Hungary
is disposed to respond favorably to
President Wilson's personal appeal
for permission for shipment of Ameri
can relief supplies to Poles in terri
tory held by Austrian forces have been
given personally by Foreign Minister
Burian to Ambassador Penfield.
The state department also received
today from Ambassador Page the Brit
ish foreign office statement of Great
Britain's willingness to permit impor
tations of foodstuffs into Poland to
be administered by a commission ap
pointed by President Wilson, provided
the German and Austrian occupying
armies would not seize or remove
products of the occupied territory.
The condition, it is feared, may block
negotiations.
Mr. Penfield reported today that he
delivered personally to Count von Bur
ian on July 26 President Wilson's plea
in behalf of famine stricken Poles and
that the foreign minister promised to
deliver the president's communication
immediately to Emperor Francis Jo
seph. The* minister's unofficial opin
ion was that the request would be met
by Austria and Germany.
Ambassador Penfield was told by
the foreign minister that Austria was
administering affairs in one-third of
Russian Poland and that famine con
ditions there have been greatly ameli
orated in recent months by good crops
and management.
State department officials regard the
reception of the president's letter at
the Austrian foreign office aB a hope
ful sign of concessions which will
eventually permit American relief
measures for the starving Poles.

NEW TANGLE IN
RULES OF Will
Germans Sentence Captain
of British Ship to Death
on Charge of Piracy
HAD ATTEMPTED TO
RAM SUBMARINE
Washington Interested in
Case Allies Expected
to Seek Reprisals
Berlin, July 28. —Capt. Charles Fry
att of the Great Eastern railway
steamship Brussels which vessel was
captured by German destroyers last
month and taken into Zeebrugge, has
been executed by shooting after trial
before a German naval court martial.
The death sentence was passed upon
Capt. Fryatt because of his alleged ao
tion In attempting previously to ram a
German submarine.
NEW TANGLE IN LAWS.
Washington, D. C., July 28.—Ger
many's execution of Captain Charles
Fryatt, master of the British steam
ship Brussels, for an alleged attempt
to ram a submarine, is regarded in
allied quarters here as a brutal vio
lation of international law likely to
result in prompt retaliatory measures
by Great Britain. They contend that
if a hostile submarine approached the
Brussels it was in effect an 'attack and
captain Fryatt, in making a counter
attack by attempting to ram subject
ed himself only to treatment as a pris
oner of war in event of capture.
The United States government is in
terested in the incident and what may
follow it, particularly because of the
bearing it may have upon the difficult
problems involved in submarine war
fare which in the past have brought
the country to the brink of war be
cause it is charged with the care of
interests- of prisoners on both sides.
Reprisals by the allies it Is feared,
might be followed by a change in the
German submarine policy.
Authorities on international law
agree that the justice or injustice of
the shooting of Captain Fryatt depends
entirely upon the circumstances under
which he headed his vessel for the sub
marine. If the submarine attacked or
was about to atack him he had the
right to counter attack if he was
seeking out an enemy vessel for at
tack he placed himself in the class of
a criminal subject to summary execu
tion upon capture.
Convention number 10 of the second
Hague peace conference sets forth
how the crews of merchantmen who
legitimately resist capture shall be
treated as part of the armed forces
of an enemy.
The question involved has been
clouded by the belligerent charges and
counter charges concerning the con
duct of submarine warfare and the al
lied efforts to exterminate the German
submarines. Germany claims British
merchant ships have orders from the
admiralty to ram any enemy subma
rines sighted and that the masters of
ships carrying out. such orders are
pirates.
Officials here point out that the
United States has taken the position
that the master of any merchant ves
sel who sees a submarine approaching
has from the very nature of the sub
marine method of warfare the right
to presume that he is about to be at
tacked. Consequently, it is argued, he
has the right to forestall that attack
by himself ramming or firing to defend
himself.
BRITISH PUBLIC UNINFORMED.
London, July 28. —News of the ex
ecution of Capt. Fryatt has not yet
reached the public here. Capt. Fryatt
was a young Harwich skipper, describ
ed as a British seaman of the finest
type.
TUNNEL WORKERS

Cleveland, Ohio. July 28.—While
workmen continued to make repairs
which will facilitate excavating the

cover the bodies of nine buried work
men, killed in Monday night's explos
ion, the investigation into the horror
was resumed today.
Tunnel workmen today sent a com
mittee to Director of Utilities Thomas
Farrell to demand greater safety and
increased wages for workmen when
the tunnel construction job is resumed.
BUTCHERS' STRIKE

out. Managers of the plants said be
tween 2,000 and 3,500 ware out.

E
UNOFFICIAL ADVICES STATE
THAT GERMAN SUBMARINE 18
TIED UP IN HALIFAX.
St. John, N. B., July 28.—J. D.
Hazen, minister of marine and
fisheries, today denied reports
that the German undersea liner
Bremen had been captured and
taken Into Halifax. Halifax re
ports also declared the Bremen
was not there.
Ottawa, Ont., July 28.—The nav
al department denied today that
there Is any foundation for the
story published In New York that
the German supersubmarlne
Bremen has been captured and
taken Into Halifax.
New York, July 28.—Another cir
cumstantial report regarding the
whereabouts of the German merchant
supersubmarlne Bremen, long expect
ed at some American port, is that the
ship has been captured by British
patrolling squadrons and is today tied
up in the northwest arm in the har
bor of Halifax, N. S.
The report of the capture, which is
published here today, is given in a let
ter said to have been written by the
secretary of a high Canadian official
to a business man of this city. The
letter is declared to have been mailed
from Buffalo, N. Y., two days ago and
therefore could not have been sub
jected to the scrutiny of the Canadian
censor.
The letter was written in confidence,
It is stated, but the information it
contained was divulged by the recipi
ent to a friend in the course of an ar
gument as to whether or not the Brem
en could pass through the British bar
rier.
The letter says:
"You seem In New York to be wor
ried about the Bremen. There is real
ly no cause for worry, for at the pres
ent time she is tied up in what we call
the northwest arm in the harbor of
Halifax and is being well taken care
of."
Jelegrams of inquiry sent to Ottawa
and Halifax have not as yet brought
any confirmation of the reported cap
ture.
The Bremen, the second unit of
Germany's proposed merchant subma
rine fleet, has been due for some days
in an American port. Private infor
mation was that she had been ordered
to make New York harbor but if this
was not feasible she was to go to.any
other American port.
DEUTSCHLAND DELAYED.
Baltimore, Md., July 28. —It was
learned from a source regarded as re
liable that the German submarine
Deutschland would not sail until offi
cial information had been received
from her sister ship, the Bremen by
her'agents here. This seemB borne out
by the statement of Captain Koenig
last Wednesday that "circumstances
and conditions over which he had no
control" were delaying his departure.
The Deutschland is all ready to sail
on short notice.
It was said the Deutschland would
make no secret attempt at a getaway
but probably would leave her pier dur
ing the day in order to arrive at the
capes under the cover of darkness.
MERCURY BULBS TOUCH HIGH
PLACES DURING EVENING AND
EARLY MORNING.
With a discrepancy of eight degrees
between the different street thermom
eters and the official register at the
water works favoring the lowest,
Ottumwans have been wondering what
the temperature really is this after
noon. The majority of those on the
down town streets have been inclined
to take the higher marks as their
standard.
Mercury bulbs, at different points
on the down down streets varied from
100 degrees to 108 degrees at 2 o'clock.
The official bulb at the water works
plant showed an even 100 at noon with
a mamimum of 102 degrees during the
past twenty-four hours.
Thursday night's temperature at 6
o'clock showed the highest of any
evening this year when it registered
98 degrees. At 8 o'clock this morn
ing it had only fallen to 86 degrees,
which is also a high mark for that time
of day.

Details of Rearing Young
Asked Witness in Court
at Winters Trial
DEFENSE BEGINS ITS
SIDE OF CASE TODAY
Sister of Baby's Father
Testifies Heat Makes
Room Uncomfortable
Many hot, perspiring women and a
few coatless men crowded District
Judge Cornell's division of the vaca
tion court this morning to hear the
case which is to decide whether little
3-year-old Constance Hope Winters is
to stay with her dead mother's sister,
Ella Buchanan, or go Into the family
of her father, Nicholas Winters.
The thermometer in the court room
cast longing eyes at the 100 degree
mark all morning and it was terribly
hot for everybody. The Judge fanned
and mopped his brow, the reporter
consumed glass after glass of ice wat
er and the witnesses squirmed in their
chairs as they dragged through the
long tiresome questions put to them by
the lawyers. Back in the public sec
tion of the room fans were going so
fast that it was hard to know anyone
was there except for the occasional
buzz of conversation which would
break loose after questions had been
put to the witnesses and they had an
swered in favor of one or the other of
the parties in the suit who are endeav
oring to secure the control of the
child.
Through it all little Constance Hope
Winters, dainty and cute in her low
neck and short sleeves, plays about
the room entirely innocent of the
case which centers about her. Part
of the time she is in her seat beside
Miss Buchanan and watches every
movement of the lawyers and again
she is down playing tlround the tables
and walking up and down the aisles
smiling at the public spectators in the
trial.
For four days now Judge Cornell
has been hearing evidence in this ac
tion which was brought under the cap
tion of a habeas corpus proceeding to
secure the release of the little girl
from any control or custody on the
part of her father. The plaintiff in
the suit, Miss Ella Buchanan, the
child's aunt, claims that Mrs. Winters
gave her the girl when she died three
days after Constance Hope was born.
She alleges in her petition that the
father has attempted to spirit her
away and keep her. It is maintained
by her side of the case that he is not
in proper physical condition to have
her in charge, that the little one was
sickly through her first three years
of life and is not strong now, and re
quires special attention such as Miss
Buchanan, who is a practical nurse,
would be able to give her.
Child's Breakfast.
What the breakfast menu for a
three-year-old child should be and
how it compares with the food a nine
ty-three-year-old man should eat com
prised some of the cross examination
testimony of Miss Rose Winters, the
child's father's sister, on the stand
today.
Miss Winters was the first witness
called when the defense was begun at
the opening of court at 8 o'clock this
morning. She discussed her methods
for caring of children and spoke of the
different standards which should be
set for their government.
It was when Miss Buchanan's law
yer asked her If she was capable of'
looking after the health and care of
a child, not naturally strong, that the
question of a breakfast menu came
came out. Miss Winters said that
Constance Hope looked to her like a
normal child and she would give it
normal food.
She said that during the twent.y
year3 of her brother Nicholas Winters'
married life, with Constance Hope's
mother, she had never tried to make
the acquaintance of her sister-in-law.
She also said that she did not know
Helen Winters, Constance Hope's
eighteen-year-old sister, because Helen
had never given her a chance to be
come acquainted.
As she left the stand she was
again emphatic that she could take
Constance Hope and rear her as a
child of modern times should be rear
ed. Her knowledge of preparing spec
ial food she said had been gained from
caring for her aged father.
NEW YORK STRIKE

Chicago, St. Louis and Milwaukee
with temperatures at 84, were the hot
test cities in the country at 7 a. m.
Winnemucca, Nev., with a temperature
of 36, was the coolest spot.
Six more deaths in Chicago due to
heat were reported to the coroner be
fore 9* a. m. today. Last night was the
hottest in Chicago's history. The tem
perature was 90 at midnight. The
temperature arose rapidly early in the
day, reaching 92 at 9 a. m. one degree
warmer than the same period yesta!*
day and going to 93 at 9:30.
Southeasterly winds, carrying prac
tically no cooling effect, prevailed.

grief.
CORN IN'DANGER.,
Des Moines, July 28.—The intense
heat which yesterday prevailed
throughout the state of Iowa and
which broke all heat records for the
year continued today. U. S. wee.tbor
bureau officials could see no prospects
of relief and predicted that the hot
wave will ruin the Iowa corn crop un
less a general rain comes inside of
four or five days. The heat probably
will continue until the first of August,
it was said.
No deaths resulting directly from
t!.e heat have been reported.
EXPECT NEW RECORD.
Decatur, 111., July 28. —At noon to
day the official temperature was 101.
A new heat record is promised before
the day is over. Yegetable gardens in
central Illinois, which supply sweet
corn and other products to Chicago, St.

New York, July 28.—The infantile

have developed in Iowa in three days.
It was said that the state health
officials do not consider the situation
as .serious. They believe there is a
possibility that in several cases a
wrong diagnosis has been made and
that the seeming paralysis may be
due to convulsion, the result of hot
weather and indigestion.
Twenty-two cases of the plague now
