of Ship's Captain by
the Germans.
CT CALLED "MURDER;"
REPRISALS NOT HINTED
ritish Foreign Office Asks Ambassador
Page to Get All
Facts in Case.
LONDON, July 29.?The mornig
newspapers today comment
itterly and at great length on
le execution of Capt. Fryatt of
le British steamer Brussels by
le Germans because he tried to
im a submarine with his steamiip.
Discussing the legal assets
of the case, the newspapers,
most without exception, quote
le United States naval war code
: 1900, article 10, clause 3, which
:ads:
"The personnel of a merchant
sssel who, in self-defense, resist
:tack are entitled, if captured,
1 the status of prisoners of war."
Nevertheless the editorials adit
that the Germans take a difrent
view, and the Daily News,
ideavoring to elucidate the Geran
viewpoint, sa^s:
"The Germans have always
>ught to draw a most implacable
ne between combatant and nonlmbatant.
and in German eves
le fate of Capt. Fryatt may quite
>nestly be logical."
Purpose of Execution.
"This murder has been perpetrated,"
ys the Daily Telegraph, "in order to
rrorize British merchant sailors, just
one of the anticipated results of the
:rman submarine piracy was that ald
sailors would become afraid to
t to sea. But British sailors refuse
terrorized."
Although the editorials condemn the
ecution of Capt. Fryatt in no doubt1
terms, it is notable that there is no
mand in any of them for reprisals.
"The whole of the civilized world,"
ys the Daily Express, "will regard
e killing of Capt. Fryatt as murder,
ill and abominable, but it will be
liowedk by no reprisals. We leave
ch cowardice to the Teutons. But
s death of this brave sailor will add
the determination to accept no peace
at does not give the allies the power
punish the Hohenzollern crimes."
rhe Daily Graphic says: "We probly
will have no immediate answer
this dastardly deed, but it will
engthen the determination to carry
the war until we are able to insist
the surrender of the German high
icials who are the authors of these
mes against the law of nations."
Asks Complete Detaifs.
Jews of the execution of Capt. Fryatt
used a painful impression at the
itish foreign office. Under the inductions
of Viscount Gray, the
reign secretary, a note was dis
tched immediately to the American
ibassy, requesting that James W.
rard, the American ambassador at
rlin, procure complete details of the
air.
The first intimation of the trial of
pt. Fryatt was called to the atten?n
of the foreign office by press rerts
July 18. to the effect that he
is to be tried as the result of finding
him a watch containing an inscrip>n
reciting his efforts to ram a
rman submarine.
^rom inquiries made of the owners
the steamship Wrexham, which Capt.
yatt commanded when the alleged inlent
took place, the foreign office
irned the captain had with him
ither a watch nor a letter to the
ect that he had attempted to ram a
bmarine with him when he was capred.
Therefore, officials here state,
e charge must have been based on
ess reports.
Asked to Provide Defense.
When the news that Capt. Fryatt
as to be tried was received the forn
office immediately sent a note to
uerican Ambassador Page, requestg
that American diplomatic reprentatives
take all necessary steps to
ovide for his defense, calling atten>n
to the fact that the Wrexham's
t in steering toward the submarine
id iorcing ner 10 oive was c?.icnuai?>
fensive and precisely the same as if
,e had used the defensive arm which
e United States and Great Britain
>ld to be an undoubted right.
No reply was received from Ambas,dor
Gerard, but the foreign office is
nvineed he acted with his usual
omptitude. Therefore, it is their
eory that the trial and execution of
ipt. Fryatt was hurried even more
an in the case of Miss Edith Cavell.
Besides the original inquiry, the forgn
office sent two other notes on the
ibject to Ambassador Gerard.
Deemed Grave Incident.
Discussing the case with the Asciated
Press. Baron Newton, under
cretary for foreign affairs, who durg
the conversation was summoned to
jreign secretary Grey's office for a
far art rf (In thp KiihlPft an t/i
"On the face of the details of the rert
as received by us, the explanation
Capt. Fryatt seems to be worse than
e Cavell case. It is an extremely
ave incident, the Importance of
fxich it would be difficult to exagrate.
It must be borne in mind that
nen the alleged ramming took place
srman submarines were attacking
erchant ships without any warning
natsoever."
A naval officer said: "The execution
Capt. Fryatt is in violation of all
w and all precedent at sea. It affects
ery merchant officer in the world,
utral as well as belligerent.
"There is no such thing known as a
inc-tlreur at sea. We have officers
German submarines whom we have
ken as prisoners of war who ramed
merchant ships without warning
d Ax ctf upon Merchant ships without
warning-, but they are treated as prisoners
of war. \Ve also have naval officers
who dropped bombs from Zeppelins
on harmless and undefended
towns and killed civilian inhabitants."
In the cross-channel service Capt.
Fryatt was known as a "pirate dodger,"
because* on several occasions he had
succeeded in eluding German submarines
by skillful navigation.
Indignation in Holland.
The execution of Capt. Fryatt has
caused great indignation throughout
Holland, says a Reuter's dispatch from 1
Amsterdam, and it is generally com- ,
pared with the execution of Miss Edith
Cavell.
The Amsterdam Telegraaf says:
"The execution causes no surprise,
but excites horror and indignation at
a crime which is as mean as the shoot- ,
! ing of the brave English nurse. It is a
j burning shame which calls for venge{
ance."
Held in Universal Esteem.
HARWICH, England, July 29.?The
news of the execution of Capt. Fryatt
was received with much indignation
here and in the neighboring town of
Dover Court, where he was very
popular. Capt. Fryatt had lived all of
his life at Parkeston, a suburb of
Dover Court. He leaves a wife and
several children.
Locally Capt. Fryatt was nicknamed
"the pirate's terror," on account of his
skillful evasion of submarines on several
occasions. He had the reputation
of being one of the most daring commanders
in the Great Eastern service. j
Friends describe him as having been
gentle and inoffensive, a man of high
honor and a^jfearless navigator. He was
held in universal esteem here.
New Phase of Controversy.
BERLIN, July 28, Friday, 1:30 p.m.,
via London, July 29, 12:35 p.m.?The |
execution at Bruges on July 27 of Capt.
Charles Fryatt of the British steamship
Brussels, after trial by court-martial
for attempting to ram a German
submarine, denotes a new phase in the
controversy over the sea rights of merchantmen.
The German government prize regulations
issued before the beginning of
the war adopted the principle that merchantmen
were not entitled to commit
acts of war and it threatened to
treat as pirates those attempting to do so.
The execution of Capt. Fryatt, German
officials contend, is in accord with
that principle and according to the German
view merely extends to sea war- '
fare the principles already controlling 1
franc tireur activity on land.
It is hoped in official circles here that
this case will lead to a definite clear- J
ing up of the question of merchant- ,
men acting at intermittent times as ,
war vessels. i

iSHIPS ATTACK
COASTOFENfiLAND
Three Zeppelins Drop Thirty
Bombs, But No Casualties
Result.
LONDON. July 29, 2 p.m.?Three
leppelin dirigible balloons participated
n the raid early this morning on the
ast coast of England, it was officially
nnounced this afternoon. There were
o casualties.
One German airship proceeded inland
or a short distance and dropped two
ombs at the side of a railway. The
Jeppelin then proceeded to an adoining
village, where eight bombs
rere dropped. The missiles fell In
elds and roads, where no damage was
one. The Zeppelin cruised about for
wenty minutes and then went off in
, northerly direction toward the coast.
Reuter's correspondent at Amsteram
reports that a Zeppelin flew over
luiskil, on the Dutch-Belgian border,
oing in a northeasterly direction. It
^as fired upon by Dutch guards.
This is the first German airship raid
n England in twelve weeks. Misty
weather favored the Zeppelins.
The official statement regarding the
'eppelin raid says:
"Three airships raided the east coast
etween midnight and 1:30. Thirtywo
bombs were dropped in Lincolnhire
and Norfolk. There was no maerial
damage and there were no
asualties. Many other bombs are reorted
to have fallen in the sea.
"At one place anti-aircraft guns
,-ere in action and succeeded in drivng
off the aircraft from their obective.
The raiders appear to have
een seriously hampered by fog."
:RANCE MAKES APPEAL
TO WORLD OPINION
PARIS, July 29.?The French governnent

labitants of the invaded cities of:
iorthern France, who the appeal says
ave been taken from their homes and
ransported to other regions, where
hey are compelled to work in the

Through Spain, acting as intermediry,
France already had protested to
iermany against its action regarding
hese civilians, but the protest was
nheeded. Germany, according to apeal,
attempts to justify the measures
aken by her because of the attitude of
Ireat Britain in rendering more apd
tore difficult the feeding of her popuition.
This action, however, the apeal
adds, is inadmissable, as the
lockade of the entente allies is a reglar
act of war and there is nothing
i The Hague convention which auhorizes
such action on the part of
Germany.

APPAM NOT A PRIZE,
IS COURTDECISION
Judge Waddill Holds Germans
Lost Control by Bringing
Her Into'U.S.
CASE WILL BE CARRIED
TO THE SUPREME COURT
Has Status of Ship Abandoned on
These Shores and Host Be Turned
over 10 owners.
NORFOLK, Va? July 29.?
Federal Judge Waddill today decided
the libel proceedings for
possession of the captured British
merchantman Appam in favor of
the English owners and against
the German prize crew which
brought her here.
The German government lost
all legal claim to the Appam and
her cargo as prizes of war when
Lieut. Berg and his prize crew
on last February 1 brought them
into the neutral waters of Hampton
roads with the intention of
"laying up" the vessel indefinitely.
Salient Points of Decision.
Judge Waddill decided. Other salient
features of the decision follow:
That the Prussian-American treaty of
1799, renewed in 1828, does not apply
or control in the case so as to guarantee
the prize crew asylum In United
States waters.
That the artlnn nf thA rjprman v?rlra
court in declaring the Appam a prize
while the oaee was in litigation in the
United States courts has no effect on
the jurisdiction of the courts.
That the jurisdiction of the United
States courts in the case is established
by a long line of precedents, including
several by the United States Supreme
Court.
Conclusion of the Court.
"The court's conclusion," the decision
reads, "is that the manner of bringing
the Appam into the waters of the
United States, as well as her presence
in those waters, constitute a violation
of the neutrality of the United States;
that she came in without bidding or
permission; that she is here in viola*
tion of the law; that she is unable to
leave for lack of a crew, which she
cannot provide or augment without
further violation of neutrality; that in
her present condition she is without a
lawful right to be and remain in these
waters; that she as between her captors
and owners, to all practical intents and
purposes, must be treated as abandoned
and stranded upon our shores, and that
her owners are entitled to restitution of
nrnncrtv whirh thic r>r?nrt chnnlH
award, irrespective of the prize court
proceedings of the court of the imperial
government of the German empire; and
it will be so ordered."
Prize Must Have a Convoy.
Ofte of the minor points which the
court decided that aroused much interest
was that a prize vessel cannot
legally be brought into neutral waters
without a convoy. The Appam was
brouerht into nort undpr hAr own stAam
after capture by the German raider
Moewe January 17 last.
Extended reference was made in the
decision to diplomatic exchanges between
Count von Bernstorff and Secretary
Lansing regarding the libeling of
the Appam in which the Secretary declared
that neither the Prussian treaty
of 1799 nor The Hague treaty of 1907
applied in the case so as to give the
prize crew the right to retain possession
of the vessel in neutral waters indefinitely.
The court disposed df The Hague
treaty briefly, holding that it was not
applicable inasmuch as Great Britain
never accepted it, but pointed out that
the attitude of the American delegates
to the convention was shown by their
rejection of article twenty-three which
would have guaranteed a prize vessel
asylum in neutral waters. The Prussian
treaty, however, was given much
attention by the court.
Holds Treaty Does Not Apply.
"The history of the adoption of this
treaty with Prussia," the decision read,
tne conditions that brought about th?
same and the cotemporaneous opinions
of th? eminent statesmen of that
day who participated in its procurement
and acceptance by the two countries
have been gone into fully in the
effort to show that it was meant to
give asylum to prizes in neutral waters
and that its particular purpose was
to afford the United States an asylum
for their prizes in Prussian waters.

LONDON, July 29.?In southern
Volhynia the Russians are
pressing their drive against Lemberg,
capital of Galicia, their advance
being greatly facilitated by
the capture of Brody, on the Dubno-Lemberg
railroad, announced
last night.
The Teutonic lines farther
north are imperiled by this move
and the co-related thrust westward
from Lutsk which has
broken Gen. von Linsingen's front
northeast of Siviniusky. The
magnitude of the Russian victories
is indicated by Petrograd's
claim to the capture of forty-six
guns, 400 officers and 20,000 men.
Gen. Letchitzky, the statement
adds, won an important victory
to the south of the Dniester, in
the direction of Stanislau.

emperor has gone to Budapest, where
intense excitement prevails.

An official statement given out by the
Austro-Hungarian war office last night
says:
"On the upper part of the Czarny
Czereomsz river several Russian attacks
failed.
"In the region north of Brody the
enemy continued yesterday during the
whole day till late in the afternoon his
assaults, but he was again repulsed and
gained no ground. A fresh attack was
undertaken in masses during the evening,
and the Russians succeeded in
penetrating our positions along the
Brody-Leszniow road. Our troops continue
the battle on the southern border
of Brody.
"Near Pustomyty, in Volhynia, Austro-Hungarians
chased back the enemy
who advanced to their entrenchment[
Northeast of Sviniuchy the local invasion
of the Russians was replied to by
a counterattack.
"In the middle of July the enemy resumed
the offensive in Volhynia after
a pause of four weeks. The total result
has been that our front on a length of
eighty kilometers (fifty miles) was
pushed into a depth of not more than
fifteen kilometers (9^ miles). The
enemy paid for this small gain of
ground, owing to 'uninterrupted strong
attacks, with enormous sacrifices."
