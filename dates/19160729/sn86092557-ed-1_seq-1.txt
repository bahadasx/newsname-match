BOY AND JlflL AFFAIR
Victim Was Killed by Air
Bubbles Introduced in
Blood.
OLNEY, III., July 29.?The Celes
tia Yculcer of the boy and girl romance
of Roy Hinderllter and his 17-year-old
sweetheart, Elizabeth Radcliff, rose
like a spectre to accuse the farmer?
boy held for the girl's strange death.
The day's quest for evidence by
State Attorney H. G. Morris revealed
more startling and blackening details
than any other since young Hinder
liter dashed up" in his bufegy last Fri
day night and delivered to physic
ians at the Olney Sanitarium the body*
of his sweetheart. She had died, |
the examining physicians reported to
the comer's jury, from the effects |
of an air bubble In tho heart, produced |
by the injection of air into an ar
tery during a bungling operation to
conceal the effects of the girl's unwise
love.
Tho new facts laid bare this after
noon by the state's attorney and by
memberd of the searching party who
ha%: turned over each blade a grass
under tho big oak where the girl
rode to her tryst with the wealthy
young farmer are these:
Hlnderliter is engaged to marry the
daughter of a wealthy farmer in Craw
ford county who lives not far from his
mother's farm.
Both the girl and her father admit
ted that an engagement existed.
Neither had ever heard of the little
Olney girl who had sacrificed even
more than her life for their young
neighbor.
When Hinderliter placed an automa
tic pistol and a slung shot in the bot
tom of his buggy, Just before he call
ed for Elizabeth last Friday, he was
prepared, State Attorney Morris-mid
today, to sacrifice his Olney sweet
heart for the girl in Crawford coun
ty.
He was prepared to ofTer Elizabeth
her choice of the bungling operation,
which he knew would probably be
fatal or death at his own hands, the
prosecutor claims.
"He was ready to murder this little
girl as she sat at his side," Mr. Mor
ris said tonight. "He had decided to
produce the pistol and tell her that he
was going to cure her or kill her; that
if she refused to submit to the opera
tion, which he hoped would destroy
the evidence of her love for him, he
would kill her. '
Thup, in a day, was Roy Hinder
liters role abruptly changed from the
heroic part of the younger lover who
raced to a town hospital with his
sweetheart's body across his knee.
The young farmer's posed bravado
was shocked into boyish terror when
news that has astonished three coun
ties tonight came to him from the of
fice of State's Attorney Morris
men Elizabeth Ratcllff came from
west Salem ten monthB ago to live
with her sister, Mrs. Bert Francher,
s''c was a happy, pretty, care.free girl.
She had known young Hinderllter
before but Is said to have favored the
attentions of Sam Harrln. and Ol
ney boy. Hinderllter called on her
only occasionally until Harrln was
called to the colors when the Fourth
Illinois marched to tho border.
With the Held clear, Hinderllter's
attentions to the country girl became
more marked. They went buggy rid
lng often. Their last ride, the police
say, was on the night the girl died
under an old elm tree two miles south
of Olney.
When hinderllter drove to a local
hospital with the girl's body across
his knees, he said, according to au
thorities, she had fainted.
Autopsy showed she was about to
become a mother. There were no
marks of violence on the body Physi
cians were absolutely at a loss to toll
the cause of death.
During tho examination a surgeon
accldently cut an artory. An air bub
ble came from the wound.
This led to an Investigation which
Showed the girl had died from air
bubles reaching her heart.
A catheter, with plunger removed,
was found next day under the elm
tree. The boys who found the Illegal
Instrument said, the police claim, that
Hinderllter aBked them to And and dls
pose of It.
The doctors say Hinderllter's |g.
norance of the instrument probably
caused him to blow Into It

GRANT P. HALL TO
RUN CAIKN
T. J. Sherrard Will Be Re
elected Republican State
Chairman.
(Spec. Dispatch to West-Virginian) ,
PARKERSBURG, W. Va., July 29.?,
A goodly Republican representation
is in Parkersburg today for the pur
pose of helping to give impetus to the
campaign movements of that party.
All the Republican nominees for state
office are on the ground and cou.
ferences have been in order through
out the day.
The purpose of the visit of the can
didates and other party war horses is
to attend the meeting of the sub-corn
mittee of the state executive commit
tee, the functions of which are to se
lect a committee chairman, secretary
and treasurer and to establish hoad*
quarters where they will be serve
the interests of the party during the
next few months.
Nothing has been done by the com
mittee yet, but it is believed by those
in touch with the situation that T. J.
Sherrard, of Wellsburg, -will be re
elected chairman, and that Grant P.
Hall, of Charleston, will be made sec
retary with the undertanding that he
will be the campaign manager, par
kersburg stands the bost chance of
getting headquarters, although Clarks
burg is making a stirr fight for them.

Clarksburg Botary
Club Holds Picnic
The first outing of the Clarksburg
Rotary Club, was held yesterday eve
ning at Traction Park and a number
of Fairmont persons were gilests of
the Clarksburgers, among them being
Industrial Engineer F. R. Speed. The
Rotary club is proving one of the most
efficient of the Clarksburg business
men's associations and is composed
of but one member from any profes
sion or line of business. A special car
on th? Traction line brought the mem
bers and a band to the park where a
baseball game and athletic contests
were enjoyed.
The outing will be an annual event,
members of the Rotary club announc
ed last night. It is customary to have
dinners at the hotel on Wednesdays
of each week, but these have been
abandoned during July and August,
and the outing of yesterday come in
to take their place. The committee
who looked after arrangements for
the outing and to whom much credit
is due for the success of it were: R.
F. McAdams, chairman; Wade H. Gar
rett, Raymond Rady; N. S. Longabaugh
and L. K. Richards.

Convention.
Nearly two hundred of the Demo*
crats of Marion county met this af
ternoon in the circuit court room at
the court house and a sort of love
feast or peace pipe meeting was held.
The purpose of the meeting as an
nounced in the official call sent .out by
the Democratic leaders was to select
' delegates to the state convention to
he held at Parkersburg next week. At
'a late hour this evening this list of
delegates had not been completed.
The meeting was opened by the
I County chairman Calvin D. Conaway,
and Hon. M. M. Neely was selected
ed permanent chairman and C. W. Mil
ler acted as secretary and read the
official caill. Tusca Morris, Charles
Powell and other prominent Democrat
ic leaders spoke of the rosy prospects
for the fall election while the "key
note speech" was made by 0. S. Mc
kinnev who waxed eloquent and por
trayed in viv|l figures 0f Bpeech and
exalted flights of imagination the sit
uation as he saw it. This effort was
in the nature of a "clarion call" to the
Marlon county Democrats to lay aside
their petty differences" and private
quarrels and come to the aid of the
party at this critical time and when
aid is needed.
The circuit court room, although all
of the windows wereopened early this
morning, was yet very warm indeed
this afternoon and practically every
one of the ^'deserving detoocrat's'' were
in their shirt sleeves and perspiring
freely before the actual work .of se-l
lecting the delegates to tho Parkers
burg convention was begun. Although
the meeting was scheduled for two
o'clock this afternoon, it was two-|
thirty before the men had assembled]
and were called to order by Sheriff
Conaway.
