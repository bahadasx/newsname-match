THE RAILROAD!
Cleveland, Otilo, July 84. The
following statement was issued
today by the Transportation
Brotherhoods,
The proposition of the railroads
to refer the demands of the rail
way brotherhoods for an eight
hour day to the interstate Com
merce Commission is nothing but
u proposition to gain time lor the
railroads and to waste time lor
the men.
The Interstate Commerce Com
mission is not now equipjed to un
dertake this task, in order to un
dertake it the Interstate Com
merce Commission Act would have
to' be radically amended uy Con
gress. Such an amcndmciii Would
require ut least month lor pus
sage, and Upon its passage several
mouths would be required before
the Commission could uctunl.y be
gin the work thus Imposed upon it
What ever may be the desuuuil
ty oi empowering the Interstate
Commerce Commission to handle
wuge disputes, this is not the time
to do it. The Commission is over
burdened with duties. A bill has
been pending before Congress, ur
gently advocated by the railroads
themselves, culling for an increase
in the membership of the Commis
sion In Order to enable it to han
dle eases already on its docket.
A resolution is now pending ' j
the House, after having been
patted by the Senate, calling lor

mtttee of L'oagress Into the need

lose of heading 0(1 HUJ railroad
legislation till ' comprehensive
survey of the entire situation
should have been made. Kepre-
tentatlves of the railroads nave
urged this resolution lor these
reasons,
iel, now . the railroads forget
ting these arguments, and irignt
el.ed at the prospect ol being
forced to yield to the beotner
hoods, are demanding hasty and
Ill-considered legislation, the first

In as much as 'he bulk of train
u.cii. work wholly within u state,
it would result in the worst mud
dle possible. A few employee hav
ing their wages lixed by the L. S.
and the rest o! them Standing just
w here they are now.
The claims made bv the rail
juads that as the Interstate Com
merce Commission has authority
over Freilht rates, it should also
have authority over rules of pay,
is a clever and seemingly plausi
ble argument, put forward to se
cure public sympathy.
The interstate Commerce Com
juiifsion has ALW.WS taken cog
nizance of wages or labor costs
in passing upon freight rates.
One of the leading arguments of
the railroads in making applica
tion ror authority to advance
their freight rates has been tnat
outlays or employes have in
cieused and as a consequence
that they should ie permitted to
charge more for their services.
Elaborate statistical exhibits

the Commission, winch set forth

dollars are paid out in wages and
salaries now as compared with
former years. v n cousequeuce,

THE PIOUS RETAINERS
By Eugene V. lebs.
It may be set down as a rulfi
that the gentry who constitute
the self -appointed protectorate of
religious salvation, and who ac
cuse .Socialists of being Infidels,
and Socialism With having designs
uon religion, are themselves ser
vile hypocrites who are profiting
by the ignorance and supersti
tion of their dupes, and using the
cloak of religion in Which to prac
tice their pious fraud and imposi
tion. Their pretended solicitude for
religion and the spiritual salva
tion of the dear people is a sham.
What they really fear Is not that
religion win be destroyed, but
that hypocrisy and false pretense
will be uncovered.
These pious misfits, who do not
know what real religion is, are
all one in raising the hue and cry
against Socialism In the name of
religion. Most of them have never
read a chapter of Socialist econ
omics and are as utterly ignorant
of what Socialism really menus
deliberately misrepresenting it to
receive the stipend and the well
done" from their capitalist mas
ters. These pious pickets of capital
ism prostitute religion in the ser
vice of mammon. Of all men on
earth, they are the least fit to
speak In the name of religion
They have no religion or they

perfectly and denounced them as

It is lalse and slanderous to

conditions which make religion
Impossible.
It is the veriest sarcasm to talk
about religion in the cannibalism
of the present system in which
men devour each other like hye
nas, and the millions who are rob
bed ol what they produce sink in
to hopeless poverty, while their
sons are driven into crime and
their daughters into prostitution.
Never, until this brute struggle
ror existence Is ended, nnd our in
dustrial lire is organized upon the
basis or democratic mutualism,
will religion come to abide with
men not the religion, so-called,
written in narrow creeds and
heartless dogmas, but of loving

FARM CREDITS
From the Milwaukee Leader.
A convention is meeting in Chi
cago this week to discuss the
question of relief for the farmer.
It proposes to devote much of its
time to a consideration of farm
credits. This is only one of a
large number of similar gather
ingsall of which are trying to
find a way to lend the farmer
mole money.
The bankers and politicians are
generally agreed that If only
some way could lie found to lend
more money to the farmer, all his
troubles would be Solved, It Is
Interesting to note that this is
almost the only instance In his
tory where a la rue class of peo
ple are to be relieved by getting
deeper in debt '.
The American farmer is rapidly
becoming a tenant. Those who
have been able to cling to their
ownership of land have been very
successful as land speculators,
since the average farm has in
creased almost 150 per cent in
value in the last I" years. But,
Just as in the factory industry so
in farming, the number that can
maintain themselves as Independ
ent owners grows fewer.
With the coming of modern
power driven machinery to the
farm, and the almost complete
control of marketing wheat, meat
; fruit and other farm products by
trustified capital, the farmer, like
the wagon worker, can only live
by using the capital belonging
i to someone else. In the transi
tional state to a further intro

This is the explanation of the
enthusiasm for various schemes
to extend credit to farmers, It Is

THAT OLD ARGUMENT.
One of the stock arguments
agalUt the Socialist party is that
! it is composed of members fro 1
the two old parties and would,
thererore. become as corrupt as
the old parties il given power.
It is not denied that the old
parties are rotten to the core.
The fact that the.v are rotten Is
used as proof that from their
membership no good can come.
But there is a wide differenc
in the construction of the Social
ist party and a capitalist party,
The rank and file, the great mass,
of all parties are honest and
want clean government, A Re
publican farmer or laborer does
not want bad government any
more than does a Democrat or
Socialist farmer or laborer.
But the basic principles of cap
italism and Socialism are oppo-
1 6ites. One is the reverse of the
.other. A capitalist government Is
one In which the rule of property
lis absolute. Property first. Life
I and liberty afterward. A "busi
i ness administration." they call it
one in Whlcb the bank clear-

ABOUT RAILROADS.
By Carl D. Thompson.
Private ownership of railroad
j Is the most gigantic system of
! plunder that ever existed. In the
j first place, the people of this na
tion, oy excessive and sometimes
fraudulent land grants bonuses
and bonds, gave the railroads
j enough to wind the wnoie sys
tems ent.re Then followed th
construction frauds. watered
stock frauds, mail frauds and a
whole train of plundering pro
cesses known only to the inaster-s
of high finance.
I To-day the railroads plunder
'the workers by low wages; ion
I hours and Impossible burdens
They plunder the people by exees

we eat. or clothes we wear, and
everything we use costs more be

Meanwhile nearly every impor

nations in the world to-day, all
but nine own all or considerable

Twenty-three great nations own

ways of the country, according
to estimates based upon findings

Now-, it is not necessary that the
government should take over the
whole system at onae, it could
buy enough of the voting stock to
get control The rest Would be
easy.
But suppose we bought out the
Whole system. We would not
need to borrow the w hole amount
since in our government banks,
and through our income and Q
berltance taxes, we WOUld al
ready have a considerable pro
portion of the necessary funds.
Bu t suppose the government
should borrow the whole S15,
000,000,000. The interest on tbs
loan at 2 "t cent would le $800
000,000. Rut the railroads' net
income over and alove all expen
ses is 8787.667,000, (Interstate
Commerce Commission Report of
l'.2. p. 42). So we could pay
the Interest on the lown and have
S437.007.000 left every year,
So under public ownership, we
could raise wages. Raise them
$100 a year to every employe
In the country, from the section
hand to president or the road.
Just as a "starter." That would
on y require $100,000,000 per
year. We would still have $887,
007.000 lert.
Next we could reduce rates an
as to reduce the cost of living.
Let $100.00,000 go for that. We
would still have $287,667,000
left.
Next let us set aside $100,000,
(00 yearly as a sinking fund tc
pay off the original debt when It
ccnie due. We would Still have
$137,667,000 left.
With that 8 18 007.000 we
could buy up the next utility;
raise wages in that industry,
shorten hours, improve conditions
reduce the cost of living; and
use the remaining profits tj buy
the next utility.
And so the Socialist program
would proceed from one utility t.
the next until the nation owned
them ail. Every step in the pro
cess would make the next ont
easier. Arid this socialization
would go on steadily reducing the
profits until there were no prof
its. It would go on until the
profit system itself was gone
till all unearned Incomes were
n'voiished till exploitation and
robbery were completely and fi
nally at an end.
