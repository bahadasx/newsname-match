A Pennsylvania preacher who went

There is a strong suspicion that all

children klie are now magnified into
the new terror, infantile paralysis.
Despite the increasing number of
deaths and new cases of infantile pa
ralysis in New York City, Health
Commissioner Emerson declares that
the death rate of children is lower
than it was last year. He stated the
records of his department showed
that 659 less infants havo died so far
in the city than in the corresponding
period of 1915.
An old abandoned mine near Eaal
feld, in the Thuringian Forest, which
in the times of Luther was worked
for silver, copper, alum and vitrol,
has been discovered by a Berlin geol

course of centuries the water perco

up throughout the mine a wonderful

What We've Had Is Only
Slarter For What's
To Come.
BERMUDA "HIGH" CAUSE.
Blanket Of Heat Is Causing
Deaths And Prostrations,
In Many States.
Washington, July 28. Bermuda
"high" is the official cause of the
worst heat wave that has enveloped
the country in fifteen years. Trans
lated from the crypitc language of the
weather sharps, that means a great
area or high pressure air has beeh
mobilizing on the weather drill
grounnds in tho Atlantic off Bermuda
for the last month and now has let go
the full power of its offensive from
tho seaboard to the Rocky mountains.
For weeks it has stood like a solid
wall, against heated currents trying
vainly to move out from the interior
over Hie ocean and now as it swirls
rapidly along, it is gathering heat and
moisture from the tropics and sweep
ing them northward over the conti
nent into the vacuum of so-called
low pressure areas". Although its
greater intensity has not yet struck
the Pacific coast, it is expected to do
so within the next few days.
NO RELIEF PROMISED.
No relief is promised from the phe
nomena which in the east has caused
sweltering city dwellers to light fires
in their homes to dry out the humidity
or which in the Mississippi valley is
threatening to destroy millions of dol
lars' worth of food crops. Chief Fore
caster Frankenfiekl said today that
the heat wave had only begun. It is
certain to continue through the week
and probably lontrer. None of the
conditions essential to a break up are
yet evident. The temperature was
above KX) at many places. Ten deaths
and prostrations were reported iir
Indiana.
MORE WIND
AND RAIN
Summer Storms Continue To
Disturb Weather
Conditions.
Another thunder storm cleared the
atmosphere in this section at 1 1 o'clock
Thursday night with much wind and
.lightning, followed by a heavy rain
over a large area. No serious damage
was done locally, though trees were
blown down in places and crops were
blown over. The rain, howevor, offset
any damages of ihis kind. It gives early
corn the one finishing touch it needed
to make a bumper crop.

shelled out of it Thursday morning by
an enfilading fire from the German
artillery. Another attack, however,
gave the British a foothold' m llltr

To the south of the Somme, the
French made further progress agatnaf
the Teutons to the cast of Estrees.
Further advances for the Russcui
