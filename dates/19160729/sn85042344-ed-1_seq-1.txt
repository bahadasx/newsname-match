secretary, a note was dispatched im
mediately to tho American embassy
requesting that James W. Gerard, tho
American ambassador at Herlin, pro
cure complete details of the affair.
The first intimation of the trial of
Captain Kryart was railed to the at

reports on July 1. to the effect that
he was to he tried as the result of
finding on him a watch containing an
inscription reciting his efforts to ram

alleged incident took place, tho for

The Russians, according to a report
from Petrograd. also have broken the

ported to have captured two generals,
nino thousand prisoners and 45 jjnns.
