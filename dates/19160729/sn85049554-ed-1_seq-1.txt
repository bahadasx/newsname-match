DEFENDS FRYATT EXECUTION.

Ships Was Issued.
Berlin, July 29.—The execution at
Bruges on July 27 of Capt. Charles
Fryatt, of the British steamship Brus
sels, after trial by court martial for
attempting to ram a German subma
rine, denotes a new phase in the con
troversy over the sea rights of mer
chantmen.
The German government prize regu
lations issued before the beginning of
the war adopted, the principle that

'merclmhtmen were net entitled to com

treat as pirates those which did so.
The execution of Captain Fryatt,
German officials contend, is in accord
with that principle which, according
to the German view, merely extends
to sea warfare-the principles already
controlling franctirer rn land.
It is hoped in official circles that
this case will lead to the clearing up
of the question of merchantmen act
ing at intermittent times as warmen.

Washington, July 29.—Forecast
of the weather bureau for the week

as follows:
"Plains states and upper Missis
sippi valley: Generally fair and
continued warm. There are no in
dications of any material change at
this time."
Washington, July 29.—Continuation
of the excessive heat now overspread
ing the central part of the country un
t'l tomorrow and Its extension to the
North Atlantic coast states, was fore
casted today by the weather bureau.
From the plains stated eastward the

states and in the Missouri and Missis
sippi valleys and the upper lake re

SLIGHT HOPE FOR RELIEF.
Small Disturbance in Northwest May
Bring Temporary Respite.
Chicago, July 29.—A lake breeze tem
pered the heat today, and at 9:30 this
morning the thermometer registered 88
decrees.
Announcement was made of a rise in
the price of ice from 35 to 40 cents per
100 pounds by several small dealers,
tho one larger company said there
would be no advance in-price. The small
dealers claimed they had been forced
by the big recent' demand to seek an
additional supply from outside the city.
A disturbance in the far northwest
that may or may not develop sufficient
strength to blow the heat out of the
furnace pot formed by the section be
tween the Rocky and Allegheny.moun
tains was charted last night'by Charles
L.. Mltchey, locfil government fore
czustcr.
He holds out, the hope, rather more
than a faint one, that Chicago may see
a break in the torrid wave late Sun
day night or early Monday porning.
The definite information will be avail
able tonight, Mr. Mitchell said.
In Canadian Rockies.
Thruout the afternoon and late into
the night the weather expert kept his
calculations centered on the one small
spot .ijp in the Canadian Rockies and
the fringe of a disturbance that extend
ed over the border into the northwest
corner of the I5nited States.
"No definite forecast as to what this
disturbance will do can be made to
night," said Mr. Mitchell, as he closed
his desk for the night after promising
nothing better than fair and continued
warm for today.
"It is possible, however, that the dis
turbance may gain sufficient force to
come across the plains' states and drive
the torrid wave away from this sec
tion late Sunday night. If the disturb
ance we now note should fall us, there
is nothing in sight to indicate a break
in the wave of heat for several days.
Hopes For High Preaaure.
"We are hoping that the compara
tively small disturbance we now have
our eye fixed on will develop into a
strong area of high pressure and that
it will begin an Irresistible sweep Chi
cagoward. If it does, we should get re
lief in this vicinity by next Monday.
But there Is nothing on the map to
night to indicate a letup/thru Satur
day and Sunday.
"The heat wave Is now pretty uni
form in the pocket between the Alle
gheny and Rocky Mountains, and to
day it extended to the northern districts
in this section. Green Bay, Wis., reg
istered 102 degrees, a record for that
section, and Marquette, far up the
lakes, also established a record. This
means that the heat is increasing in
the districts from which we might
hope for aid, if the northwest disturb
ance got started this way.
"To get across this large area of heat
the disturbance must be of consider
able force, and by tomorrow night we
will be able to say with some deflnite
r.ess whether that it is to be."
At 1:30 the temperature was 96.
Thirty-two deaths from heat had been
reported today-

Great Britain Explains In

list Order.
CURRENT DEBTS
TO BE PAID FIRMS
No Idea of Blacklisting Firms That Do
Business With Corporations Now Un­
der Ban—Germany Resents Insinua
tion Measure Is in Retaliation For
German Action Along Similar Lines
—Deutschland Doesn't Sail.
Washington, July 29.—The British
blacklist is not intended to go beyond
the principals named in the list and
there can be no indirect injury to Am
erican firms, aa explained to the state
department today by Sir Cecil Spring
Rice, the British ambassador.
It is represented that there is no
idea of blacklisting a neutral firm
simply because it intends to do busi
ness with a blacklisted firm, but if a
Arm acted as haibltual cover for a
blacklisted Arm, and so caused direct
trading between British firms and
blacklisted firms the cases would be
different.
It is provided that current debts
shall be paid to blacklisted firms unless
such claims are to create credit for
enemy firms.
The department was informed that
many licenses have been granted to
British firms to receive from and pay
to Knauth. Naehod & ICuhne and
Zimermann & Forshay, and that there
is no objection to the Goodyear Tire
Company filling out standing contracts
but that it would be well to obtain the
statement of the amount filled.
Germany Resents Insinuation.
Berlin, July 29.—The reply of Lord
Robert Cecil, minister of war trade, in
the British parliament, on the British
blacklist and the insinuation that it
only followed the German example,
evolced a sharp
semi-official
rejoinder
from the Norddeutsche Allegemeine
Zeitung, which accuses the minister
with trifling with the truth.
The paper says the arguments al
Te'ady were controverted in th«? Ger
man memorandum to the neutrals on
June .13, on tlie illegality of British
measures against neutral, firms. Lord
Robert did not attempt, the paper says,
to reply to the memorandum, but tried
to blacken Germnny by asserting that
Gormany resortod to similar mpfisurfs.
Deutschland Still at Norfolk.
Baltimore. July 29.—Conferences
among officials of the Eastern For
warding Company, American agents of
the CiTman submarine Deutschland
and her commander. Paul Koenig, were

Germany Protests Plan for Feeding
People in Occupied Territory.
Berlin, July 29.—At the foreign of
fice the following statement was
given out:
"Viscount Crey (British secretary
for foreign affairs) answered the
American president's appeal to all tho
belligerent nations to establish an
understanding with regard to relief
work in Poland and issued a declar
ation. which is no more or less than
an attempt to include the territories
occupied by Germany and Austria in
to the system of starvation of Ger
many which has been proclaimed by
the British government.
"Viscount Grey tried to make the
German government responsible for
this plan. This is British hypocrisy,
which in this case is especially
transparent."
