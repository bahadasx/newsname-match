U. S. Court Rules That German
Prize Crew Lost Legal Claim
by "Laying Up" Ship.
TOOK HER TO NORFOLK.
Decision Holds Action by
Kaiser's Prize Court in Claim
ing Steamer Has No Effect.
NORFOLK, Va., July !. Federal
Judge Waddlll to-day ''elded the libel
proceedings for possession of the cap
tured Urltlsh liner Appam In favor
of the English owners and against
the Oerman prise crew which brought
her here. f
The Court held that the Oerman
Government lost all legal claim to the
Appam and her cargo as prise of war
when Lieut Berg and hie prize crew
on Feb. 1 of this year brought them
into the neutral watora of Hampton
Roads, with the intention of "laying
up" the vessel Indefinitely.
The Court held, further, that tho
Prussian-American treaty of 1T, re
newed in 1828, does not apply or con
trol in the case so as to guarantee
the prize crew system In United
States waters.
That the action of the German prlae
court in declaring the Appam a prlxv
while the case was In litigation in the
United States courts haa no effect on
the Jurisdiction of the courts.
That the Jurisdiction of tho
United States Courts In the case is
established by a long line of prece
dents, Including several by the 8u
preme Court.
"The court's conclusion," the decision
reads, "Is that the manner of bringing
the Appam into the water of the
United States, as welt aa her presence
In those waters, constitutes a violation
of the neutrality of the United States ;
that she came In without bidding or
permission; that she Is here In viola
tlon of tho law; that she is unable to
leave for lack of crew, which she can
not provide or augment without
further violation of neutrality; that in
her present condition she is without
lawful right to be In and remain in
tho so waters.
'That she as between her captors
and owners, to all practical Interests
and purposes, must be treated
abandoned and stranded upon our
shores and that her owners aro en
titled to restitution of their property,
which this court should award, ir
respective of tho prize court proceed
Ings of the court of the Imperial Gov
ernment of tho Oerman Umpire, and
It will bo so ordered."
WASHINGTON, July 2J. The Fed
eral Court's decision holding for the
British ownere In the Appam case
confronts the United States Govern
ment with deciding what to do with
Lltut. Herg and his prize crew, which
bruirht n tho ship after one of the
most thrilling captures In the sea
history of tho war.
Generally speaking, Herg and his
men aro regarded as part of Oor
mcny's naval forces, and If that view
were carried out to Its conclusion,
they would have to bo Intornpd for
tno war with tho crews of tho two
ether Gorman commerce raiders,
Prltm Eltel Frledrlch and Kronprlnz
WUhelm at tho Norfolk Navy Ynrd.
When tho Appam camo In her Ger
man captors doclarcd that rather
than surrender tho prlzo to tho Ilrlt
ish they would take her outside th
three mile limit and sink her. Th
Federal Court, nowever. has no.
hoksIoii ot tho ship and any attempt
to move her undoubtedly would bo
questioned.
