INS. LONDON. July 29. A Maastricht
dispatch has reported that the kaiser
has confirmed the death sentence of
Captain Fryatt, of the channel packet
Brussels. This further inflamed Brit
ish feeling. Press and public declar
ed Fryatt's execution was cold-blooded
and ferocious and worse than
Edith Cavell's. ,
The Maastricht dispatch sad the
Duke of Wurtemburg had wired the
news uf the death sentece to imper
ial headquarters assing for confir
mation. The war council granted it:
immediately. All members, includ
ing the kaiser and General Von
Falkehayn. voted yes.
The British foreign office claims
that the allegat on of the German
government that Captain Fryatt had
with him a watch bearing an inscrip
tion commending him for an attempt
to ram a submarine, is untrue. Offi
cials of the foreign office state that
th charge against Captain Fryatt
must have been based on press reports.
Captain Fryatt was known as a
"pirate dodger ' on account of BtU
success in eluding German submarines
in the channel and North sea.
The foreign office also has sent a
protest to the American embassy
asking for the immediate relea-e o
