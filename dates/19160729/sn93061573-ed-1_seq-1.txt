t,To avoid the" possible occiiranre
of damage suits which might arise
in the future over establishing the
grade of the streets of the towi:,und
for the, convenience of the builders
of homes in Uie city who wish to im
prove their property permanently
nd without dread of future changes
the board of trustees have decided
to establish the grade of the principle
streets of the village before the build
ing boom starts.
Engineer C. A. Lomax, assistant to
Engineer H. O. Inierr, and a force
have been busy the past week with
level and rod determining the pro
per grade of the city streets ant has
about completed the work. v A plat
of the grades wll he on lile 't the
city clerks office and the builder who
wshes to put down a reinen! curbing
or sidewalk will only have to re
fer to this plat to get the proper
grade of the street.
This step will insure a uniforomity
of sidewalks and curbs that is some
times lacking in the larger cities,
where no provision has been made
for a uniform grade until the homes
were practically all built, v
A survewy would have practically
been necesary for the extension of
the water works, is planned, "mi the
trustees are making one survey

The grade established in this sur

municiptlity ever undertake the
construction of n modern sewage

SISTERS PLAN FAIR TO RSE

Seminary As Planned Would Re a
Credit To Clayton; Means Of
Centering Custom For
Many Miles
The plan of the Franciscan Sis-t-es,
of the local Catholic church, to
build in Clayton a seminary for the
young ladies, and a parochial school,
T one that should receive t lit" sup
port of every business man in the
city, not onlv because the school
itself is a needed illsl i 1 11 1 imi hi, I f,,.-
for
the business reason that parents
having daughters in the school would
make Clayton their shoping point,
thus transacting necessary business
and visiting their children at the
same time.
A meeting of the Sisters was held
the fore part of the week and plans
were made for holdinu' a fair, or
Raxar, Tur the purpose of raising
funds for (lie proposed school. Sev
eral parlies, it is understood, have
expressed their willingness to sub
scribe to the fund and it. is thot the
matter will be pushed to comple
tion within the next few months.
WILL RAISE WATER TANK AND
LOWER INSURANCE RATES
Engineer Dim-it Suggests that Water
Preitsiire He Drought to I'nder
ivriter's Standard Dy
Simple Method.
To lessen the lire risk of Clayton
by raising the water presMire of the
city mains to sixty poun'ds per
square inch, which is the pressure
requried by the Fire Underwriters,
has been suggt sted to the Hoard of
Trustees by Consulting Engineer
DueiT, and the .suggestion has been
adopted.
Duerr proposes to raise the pres
sure in the mains by raising the tank
some forty live feel, vvhcli will give
tin- pressure reipiired.
.lust hovv the tank will be raised
has not been deermiued. The struct
ure weighs some twenty tons and to
life it bodilv would be u itilnrnlf
task. Such things have been acconi-!
plished, however and Mr. Duerr will
ask for bids for the contract of
raising the tank in that manner or
by tearing it down and reconstruct
ing it.
Ttyit "Persecution Again
The Citizen referring to Mr. Man
sker s very recent attempt to get his
case removed from I'nion County to
the Judicial Disrict in which Charlie
Speiss lives, again designates those
engaged in the prosecution of this
case as "persecutors." It might well
be asked why Mr. Mausker or his at
torneys, or some one of them or all
of them, are so fearful of ir in?
to trail in this case in Union County.
Surely it couldn't be because they
would not enjoy having the facU in
this case "turned inside-out" for nnh
lie consideration it the face of their
long-winded and long-standing argu
ments to the effect that nothing can
possibly be brought out agaist "Poor
old Hob" for all these alleged
charges are simply trumpted up
against him.
Oilers Ideul Place For Picnic
J. A. Stephenson, part owner of the
old Tranquillina Garcia place, near
the New Home school house has of
fered the -use of that place to the
Old Settlers for their annual penic
to be held the third of August. Mr.
Stephenson offers the place free of
charge to the committee on arrange
ments and it is likely tnat they will
take advantage of his offer. There is
a large grove of trees and plenty of
good water on the place and it is a
far better site for the picnio than
the New Home school, it is said.

At the close of the institute, a lOul-

proposed to the assemblage a set of
resolutions stating their appreciation
of the efforts of the faculty and en-
"loising the institute as the best

the Hoard of Education for the use

J. O. Williams for his many and
pleasant acts as janitor.
The various committees are thank

NUMBER 31
CONTRACT FOR DRILLING THE
FIRST CITY WELL AWARDED
Greenville Man The Successful Bid
der On First Step Toward
Adequate Water Sup
ply For Clayton.
It. W. Williams of Grenville, was
Tuesday evenimt awarded the con
tract for drilling the llrst well for
the city which is the initial step to
ward an adequate supply of water
for all purposes. iMr. Williams bid
against two other parties and secur
ed the contract at the following
price; for the first three hundred
feel. ím.Tj per foot; "nd an increase
of titty cents per foot for every
hundred feet until the full thous
and feel is reached. The last one
hundred feet of the well, should it be
necessary to go one housand feet
will cost the city per foot.
That it will be necessary to ex
ceed seven hundred feet in depth,
however, is doubtful, according to
Knuineei- H. O. Duerr, who is of the
opinion that the Dakota sand stone,
the water bearing stratum of this
ection, will be reached at approxi
mately seven hundred feet.
The contract awarded Mr. Wili
iams, w ho is the possessor of a Key
stone rig capable of drilling sixteen
hundred feet, calls for a twelve inch
bore, decreasing toward the bottom
to not less than tiulit inches. The
contractor further ugreees to fur
nish everythini? necessary for the
well and to turn the well over Iqf
the city drilled (mall specifications

(.Work on ifi-illinir the well will Ha
started in two weeks and the work
will
be
pushed to a completion as
as good workmanship will
rapidly
permit. "
Engineer Duerr seemed pleased
with the bids received, and entirely
satisfied that Mr. Williams Would
complete his contract in the short
est possible ime.
After awarding the contract the
hoard of trustees instructed Mr.
Duerr to proceed with drawing up
the plans and specifications for the
other improvements he has suggest
ed and which have been a bop led.
These plans call for relaying the
principle water mains of the city.us
ing larger pipe throughout, and the
construction of a concrete reservoir
near the electric light plant of a
half million gallon capacity.
v New and efficient pumps will be
needed to raise the water to the
reservoir and the old equipment will
prob"bly be overhauled and repari
d for use in raising the water from
he reservoir to the tank which will
supply the city.
