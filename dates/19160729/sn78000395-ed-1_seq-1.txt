[Taxation Expert Says Great
Fault of Industrial Justice
Is Monopoly.
[TAXATION URGED TO
BREAK UP MONOPOLIES
Country Will Be Prepared When
Resources Are Properly
Distributed He Says.
WASHINGTON, July 27.—"Monop­
oly of natural resources held at mo­
nopoly prices inevitable means pov­
erty for many," writes Benjamin C.
Marsh to the committee on industrial
relations.
Mr. Marsh is a taxation expert and
economist of New York, and is pro­
moting: the'series of conferences on
real preparedness throughout the
country.
Frank P. Walsh at one of those
conferences in New Yorfk said: "The
great fault of industrial justice and
social welfare is monopoly—monopoly
of land, monopoly of- natural re­
sources, monopoly of power to control
other men's lives. The great evil in
the monopoly of land is shown in the
sinister increase of tenant farmers
and landless men in the cities, who
would be farmers if they could. The
monopoly of natural resources other
than of land is shown in the brutally
low wages paid to those who dig coal
in the bottom of the mine for th? en­
richment of those who take the profit
at the top of the mine. It is shown
in the concentration of farm land, of
mineral lands, of oil lands and of
water powers in the hands of giant
corporations and in the hands of an
exploiting class of speculators, bank
jers and concession grabbers.'

jconcentration of wealth in the hands

Railroads Would Have Commis­
sion Consider Demands So
As to Delay Action.
HAS NO POWER TO
FIX WAGE SCHEDULES
Rail Officials Are Asking Hasty
and Ill-Considered Federal
Legislation.
CLEVELAND, Ohia, July 27.—
The following statement was isstied
today by the Transportation Broth­
erhoods.
The proposition of the railroads to
refer the demands of the railway
brotherhoods for an eight-hour day
to the interstate commerce commis­
sion is nothing but a proposition to
gain time for the railroads and to
waste time for the men.
The interstate commerce commis­
sion is not now equipped to under­
take this task. In order to undertake
it the interstate commerce commis­
sion act would have to be radically
amended by congress. Such an
amendment would require at least a
month for passage, and upon its
passage several months would be re­
quired before the commission could
actually begin the work, thus im­
posed upon it.
Whatever may be the desirability
of empowering the interstate com­
merce commission to handle wage
disputes, this is not the time to do it.
The commission is over-burdened
with duties. A bill has been pending
before congress, urgently advocated
by the railroads "themselves, calling
for an increase in the membership of
the commission iij order to enable it
to handle cases already on its docket.
A resolution is now pending in the
house, after having been passed by
the senate, calling for an investiga­
tion by a joint committee of congress
into the need for railroad legislation,
particularly into the need for legisla­
tion affecting th$ interstate com­
merce commission. This resolution
was introduced at the request of the
railroads and for the express purpose
of heading off any railroad legisla­
tion till a comprehensive survey of
the entire situation should have been
made. R6preSeTft&trVes~ of "the" rati*
roads have urged this resolution for
these reasons.
Yet now the railroads, forgetting
these arguments, and frightened at
the prospect of being forced to yield
to the brotherhoods, are 'demanding
hasty and ill-considered legislation,
the first effect of which would be to
give them an advantage in their dis­
pute with their employes.
The commission only has authority
over rates, etc., on interstate traffio
and has no control over matters that
are wholly within a state.
If authority is conferred on the in­
terstate commerce commission by
congress, to fix or exercise any con­
trol over wages, it would only apply
to employes whose runs are from one
state to another.
Inasmuch as the bulk of trainmen,
work wholly within a state, it would
result in the worst muddle possible.
A few employes having their wages
fixed by the U. S. and the rest of
them standing just where they are
now.
The claim made by the railroads
that as the interstate commerce
commission has authority over freight
rates, it should also have authority
over rates of pay, is a clever and
seemingly plausible argument, put
forward to secure public sympathy.
The interstate commerce commis­
sion has always taken cognizance ,of
wages or labor costs in passing upon
freight rates.. One of the leading ar­
guments of the railroads in making
application for authority to advance
their freight rates has been that out-

coal deposits of this country should
be In the hands of private owners
whose desire for profits induces them
not only to beat down wages of the
workers to starvation limits, but in­
duces them to resort to "brutal intimi­
dation, to the corruption of govern­
ment and governmental officials, and
to the meanest thievery, bribery and
graft to add to their profits. This is
a matter of the most serious conse­
quences to this generation and future
generations, that the nathral wealth
of the country, the fuel of the coun­
try, on which all industry depends,
should be controlled not for the pub­
lic welfare, but for all that is an­
tagonistic to the public welfare."
Mr. Walsh took charge of the case
at the urgent request of the United
Mine Workers of America and of
John P. White, its president. As
much of his work as chairman of the
United States Commission on Indus­
trial Relations had to do with inves­
tigation of the mining industry, and
as his Investigations had led him to
champipn the cause of the mine'
workers along with other workers in
industry, Mr. Walsh refused to accept
any compensation for his services.
Associated with him in the case were

for Mr. Howat, -and Redmond''.',8.

Crowned Heads Must Explain
Cause of Conflict When
Peace Is Secured.
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., July 29.—It
is a general belief that a basis for
settlement of all the questions of the
class struggle could be easily found,
if the warring governments did not
fear the coming of peace, writes The
United States- Mine Workers' Journal.
With the return of peace will come
the reckoning. The price each nation
has paid will be charged .against the
apparent advantages gained, and there
can be no doubt but that the price
will be found excessive. Then the
question '.'who is to blame" will have
to be answered.
The industries of all of the warring
nations have been dislocated and co­
ordinated to meet the exigencies, of
the war. The workers in all the coun­
tries have sacrificed to their coun­
tries' necessities working rules that
had been attained by the struggles of
centuries upward from%slavery. Wages
have ben depressed when compared
with the upward trend of the prices
of all commodities. Women have been
drafted into industries heretofore
barred to them, and the question will
arise—where to* place the millions of
men who will return and find their
places in the industries filled by their
sisters, sweethearts and wives?
If the war has made for the disci­
pline of all the citizens of the coun­
tries embroiled, it has also,-to a great
extent, "democratized" the armies.
Leaders of armies have arisen from
the ranks have superceded the in­
competents who commanded through
privileges of birth.
ST. LOUIS UNIONS PLAN
TO FOLLOW UP VICTORY
ST. LOUIS, July 27.—With the suc­
cessful termination this week of 'the
strike of the municipal garbage driv­
ers, organized labor is planning to
renew its fight here to compel the
administration to live up to its prom­
ise to pay the prevailing union rates
of wages on all city jobs.
The garbage drivers wer« out ex­
actly five days, demanding $65 a
month, the prevailinjg, wage.. T£.e city
r«!fuiretf ^to give tntthtil the-Health
Board advised the may6r* that th& un­
collected offal in the residence sec­
tion in hot weather was liable to
cause an outbreak of disease. Then
the authorities got busy) and agreed
to pay the rates demanded by the
drivers.
A conference was held by union
representatives thift week, and an­
other delegation will wait on the
mayor in an effort to make him live
up to the promises' made. It is de­
clared that the city administration is
dodging the issue by declaring that
as many city employes are unorgan­
ized, the prevailing rates of wages re­
ceived by arganizanized labor is not
a fair comparison. On the other
hand, the unions assert that as no
union worker would accept less than
the union scale—constituting the pre­
vailing rate—the movement to get
the city to pay such rates is aimfed
chiefly to benefit the unorganized
workers.
COAL MINERS WIN
THEIR DEMANDS
KANSAS CITY, July 27.—Wage in­
creases of from three to five cents a
ton were granted by the coal oper­
ators at a conference here recently
'between a committee of miners and
members of the Southwestern Inter­
state Coal Operators' association. The
agreement affects Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma and Arkansas. The present
contract expires Aug. 1.
The increases are are follows: Three
cents a ton on mine run coal five
cents increase a ton on wall work,
and a five per cent' per day increase
for yardage, day and dead work.
For nearly four years Alexander
Howat had suffered under the stigma
cast by this powerful corporation and
its tools. This corporation, the Cen­
tral Coal and Coke Company, is capi­
talized for $7,000,000 the total value
of its property exceeds $21,000,000.
With Charles S. Keith as its president
it is the dominating member of the
Southwest Coal Operators' Associa­
tion, including all the big companies
in the States of Missouri, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arkansas, and part of
Texqp and all with a total capitalized
wealth of about $40,000,000. The
Gould and other great national finan­
cial interests are connected with that
Southwest Association through the
ownership of the Western Coal and
Mining Company, as its president tes­
tified in the trial of the Howat case,
by the Missouri Pacific Railwayv

BEST CONDITIONS IN

Women Workers In Springfield,
111., Shown To Be Gre&%
Benefited.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. July '27.—
That trade unionism is. a first, line of
defense against Ions hours and low
wages is the testimony of the survey
report on industrial conditions: in this
city made by the Department of Sur­
veys and Exhibits of |he Russell
Sage .Foundation., The evidence is
offered in the calm language a
non-partisan statements of fact. In­
vestigators from the New York head­
quarters of the Foundation -collected
the original data and half 4 score of
experts collaborated in checkfttg the
results and preparing the recom­
mendations.
The full report will say among
other things, that the investigation
revealed "shorter hours as" th% role iti
union shops. Among -employes in
these shops, for example,. 54-per'cent
had an eight-hour day, white in the
unorganized establishments only 7
per cent worked eight hours or less.
Only 13 per cent of the. men in the
union' shops, moreover, worked ten
hours as compared witji 37" per cent
in the non-union work, places. ?hese
figures tend strongly support the
trade unionists' point that organized
workers are able to gain, and do gain,
for themselves advantages which
workers actiiig individually do not
enjoy and they refute the claim of
many employers who oppose Organi­
zation of their workers that they vol­
untarily grant all of the benefits
which employes might secure through
the union.
Hours of Work.
"The long .list of trades in the
eight-hour column indicates some­
thing of what labor organizations
have been able to accomplish in. re­
ducing hours for. in the, not distant
past all of these groups, were working
nine hours- -pes^dra^cr mote. More­
over, even in: t^^eMrie of.£$]hietrades
shown la- t# ten^nomv.' column, the
union had reduced hours! The brew­
ery drivers, for instance, whose ten
hour day still seems long, can look
back to the time when they were re­
quired to complete their rounds re­
gardless of time. Likewise ice drivers
at the time of the survey were rer
quired to work from six to twelve
hours per day, depending on the
weather, whereas formerly their
hours extended from daylight even
into the night.
"The strongest labor union group
in Springfield undoubtedly is the
miners, who have 10 local unions
with a total membership of about
2,500. The mines Of the Vicinity are.
run on a strictly closed shop' basis
and since 1898, when the unions won
a great victory in this industry, the
eight-hour day has prevailed.
"Most of the other trades, repre­
sented in the table, however, were not
thoroughly organized and while the
hours given are those of members
of the union, other workers in the
trade were working longer hours.
This was true, :for example, of
many boilermakers, .machinists, iron
moulders, and carpenters.
Unionism and Wages.
"Among skilled and. semi-skilled
Workers 4n- factories, ^the JDUllding
trades, and on railroads,^ as we have
seen, labor unions have had an ef­
fective influence in increasing wages.

Favorably on Measure Dur­
ing This Session.
WASHINGTON, July 27.—Yielding
to an urgent request from President
Wilson, Democrats of -the senate in
caucus determined to pass the child
labor bill at this session of congress.
The decision was reached after a
long debate, during which, several
southern senators, whose opposition
forced the measure out of the impera­
tive legislative program drawn up
several tlays ago, vigorously objected
to its reinstatement The. Qnal deter­

trict of Columbia appropriations have
been passed. The shipping measure
will follow it in order and the reve­

Mapority Leader Kern outlined to
the caucus the president's earnest re­
quest for. a vote, on the child labor
bill, before, adjournment and read a
flood of telegrams from influential cit­
izens throughout tho country, urging
its passage.
Southern senators replied, insisting
that the caucus should stand on its
former decision postponing considera­
tion of the measure until December.
They made an appeal to the caucus
for a declaration of principle that the
child labor bill should be taken out
of politics and revealed the fact that
negotiations had- been made with some
of this Republican senators after the
recent Democratic caucus with a view
to reaching an agreement for taking
up the bill next session as a strictly
nonpartisan measure.
These plans, it was asserted in the
caucus, were progressing favorably
until President Wilson went to the
capitol a week ago and made known
to administration leaders his emphatic
desire for immediate action on child
labor legislation.

DECLARES MEN HAVE
RIGHT TO QUIT WORK
Workers Who Enlist Called Out
to Fight Against Fellow
Employes.
WASHINGTON, July 27.—"So long
as the national guard or the state
militia can be utilized and so long as
it is more and more used for strike
purposes, and as the police force of
the state, it stands to reason that no
considerable portion, in fact, a very
small portion, of the laboring men
will ever gfve it their consideration or
support. They will not join an organ­
ization which may the next day be
called into service against either
themselves or their fellow workmen."
This forceful statement of the rea­
son for the stand takefi by organized
labor against the state militia was
made before the United Sjtates senate
by Senator William E. Borah, Idaho,
in a speech against a proposed bill to
increase appropriations »for the na­
tional gi^ard.
Don't Want Lawlessness.
"The great boffy of laboring men of
this. country," said Borah, "are com
mitted to no such doctrine as that of
accomplishing their designs and pur­
poses through lawless methods. One
thing the laboring men contends he
hks a. right to do, and which I pre­
sume no one in this country would
deny him the, right to do, and that is
to strike, to quit work.
"The difficulty has been, and the
experience we have had in many
states is, that those in power do not
wait until there is. such actual demon­
stration of lawlessness as to necessi­
tate calling out the state militia it
has come to be the practice—and it
is growing more and more each year
—that immediately on a strike being
called a military force, so near at
hand and so ready to be used, is
called in for the assumed purpose of
maintaining law and order and time
and again the lawlessness" began when
the military force was called into ac­
tion.
Have Rigtit to Strike.
"Now, I would be far from defend­
ing lawlessness, but I maintain labor­
ers have a right to quit work. And,
moreover, I. contend that if they be

cording to the established law of the
land and in the common, law courts.of
the country, and' hot by improvised
court-martial tribunals. It Is not a
question of lawlessness against which
we are all arrayed, but a question of
whether, if lawlessness does occur, the
guilty ones shall be proceeded against
according to the spirit of our institu­
tions or the spirit of military despot­
ism.
"I called attention the other day to
the tendency in this country during
the last 10 or 15 years to call into
service on the slightest excuse the
state militia or the national guard
in strike matters, matters which gen­
erally have been heretofore settled
without the interference of military
authority.
Cites One Instance.
"I am familiar with one instance in
which the state militia was called
into action, wherein it was-found af­
ter they were called that the cap­
tains and lietenants and colonels and
officers of the guard were, practically
all on the pay roll and in the employ
of the companies against which the
strike was proceeding.
"It transpired in* that instance that
practically the entire control of the
state militia was a part of the employ­
ment and a part of the pay roll of the
•corporations against which the labor­
ing men were making their conten­
tion. It resulted in one of the most
disgraceful episodes that has charac­
terized this entire matter from the be­
ginning. It' naturally followed that it
would.be so, because those who were
interested financially, with their prej­
udices and their interests aroused,
were the parties .who,, under.military
organization -and military authority,
had the right to act ay. otherwise

ATTEMPT TO CRUSH LABOR
vhose culmination was in the four
weeks of the court trial. The person
Hazen, used by the powerful Mr.
Keith and others to destroy the union
by secret corruption, never showed
his face in the court room. He was
in communication' during the trial,
however, with Keith and Keith's at­
torneys, and .it was proved that the
money he said he gave to Howat he
put in his own bank, on his own bank
account, subject to his own checks.
It was proved that this money he
drew out in the ordinary course £f a
checking accortmt and thaft Howat
never saw one cent of it. It was
proved further that instead of work­
ing for the arbitration clause (for
which he was supposed to have sold
himself) Alexander Howat continued
his vigorous and successful opposi­
tion to the arbitration clause. It was
proved by all the evidence that Howat
fought with the same vigor, for the
rights of the miners against Hazen

Four Great Brotherhoods Are
Casting Vote On Strike for
Eight-Hour Day.
UNIOtf MEN BELIEVE
STRIKE VOTE CARRIED
Attempt Will Be Made to Get
Early Action From Railway
Managers.
The four great railroad brother
hoods are completing their general
strike vote that was begun a month
ago when- the national conference
committee of the railroads of the
United States refused to grant the
union's demand for an eight-hour
day and time and a half pay for
overtime work. By the end of the
week most of the 600 general adjust­
ment committee chairmen .of the
brotherhoods will be on their way to
Neyr York with the ballots which
will be counted here under the direc­
tion of the officers.
The general strike ballots have
been voted by nearly all the members
of the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers, Order of Railway Conduc­
tors, Brotherhood of Locomotive Fire­
men and Enginemen, and Brother­
hood of Railway Trainmen Accord­
ing to reports reaching New York
from many parts of the country,
from 90 to 95 per cent of the mem­
bers have voted.
That the general strike -vote has
carried by a large majority is pre­
dicted by New York members of the
union. The railroad managers and
other officials of the roads have been
so violent in their attacks on the
brotherhood and their officers that
most conservative members have
changed their position on the ques­
tion of a strike and are standing with
the more radical members for strike.
Officials of the railroad firemen's
brotherhood announced that a strike
vote taken on the ftudson river divi­
sion of the New* York Central railroad
stood 309 for a strike and only one
against a strike unless £he demands
are met. Only nine of the firemen
are not union members. The freight
locomotive engine drivers approved
the strike measure, it is stated, by
a vote of 199 -to 3. There are five
non-union engine drivers on this divi­
sion.
The vote, on the Long Island rail­
road division of the Pennsylvania
system shows, union leaders assert,
that 99 to 99% per cent of the freight
Tengin&T_arivers» foremen, conductors
vor of a strike in case the demands'
are not met.
Recruit Strikebreakers.
The railroad managers appear to
have inside information about the
strike vote, for they have begun re­
cruiting strikebreakers from the
ranks of the unorganized workers.
Such attempts to recruit strikebreak­
ers' have been ridiculed by Austin B.
Garretson, president of the conduc­
tors' union, and Warren S. Stone,
president of the telegraphers' union.
Both declare there are not enough
experienced men in the nation to
take the places of the 400,000 broth­
erhood members if they walk out.
Garretson, Stone, President Lee of
the Brotherhool of Railway Train­
men and President Carter of the
Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen
and Enginemen will have their head­
quarters at the Broadway Central ho­
tel. 573 Broadway. The ballot count
probably will take place in some large
hall or ,at the Broadway Central hotel.
The general chairman will hold their
first meeting on Aug. 1.
The report of the brotherhood vote
will be sent to Elisha Lee, assistant
general manager of the Pennsylvania
lines, who is chairman of the confer­
ence committee of the railroad man­
agers. Lee will call the 19 managers
together and arrange for a conference
between the committee and the union
officers similar to that which be­
gan June 1 and ended in failure to
get together.
Strike Vote as Club.
This time the conference will pro­
ceed along different lines. The broth­
erhood officers will have the general
strike vote club to hasten the mana­
gers to come to some decision. The
managers will try to delay matters

into other acts of attempted fraud
against the unions by the'coarOwners
was rarely if ever before exposed to
full view in a criminal or civil court.
The case was one that, tested the
quality not only of the jury but of the
judge who presided at the trial and
made it possible to bring out the
truth and to Bave the jtruth triumph.
Alexander Howat and the cause of
union labor-for which he stood in
that trial were fortunate that an in­
telligent and incorruptible judge, a
judge of broad human sympathies,
Thomas J. Seehorn of .the'Jackson
County Circuit Court, presided and
held the scale of justice even.
Perjury in the trial was added to
slander before the trial. Nothing
which has brought reproach to the
greedy type of big business and to the
misuse of power both in the name of
business and in the. name of law, was
lacking from that gigantic conspir­
acy to ruin Howat. and, through
Howat, to crush out labor unionism
in that section. It was as if the great
interests antagonistic to union labor
had set the stage for one sweeping, f.,
decisive victory against labor. But
if they chose their battle ground they &
chose It mlstakehly. They lost. The
victory was won for union labor.' .4/*L
In the r—nits of that fight union,
labor and the miners' organisations
emerge, as Alexander Howat emerges. ^T
