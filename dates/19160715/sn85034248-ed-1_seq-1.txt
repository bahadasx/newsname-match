"Unto Tl'hos Who S;n."
putrons of the Genm may look for
ward to aun attractioni of exceptional
interest tonight, when the remark
able Selig Red Seal feature, "Unto
'Those Who Sin'," will constitute the
program, lÂ·'iinland's most charming
ard gifted star, F'ritzi Brunette, is
ieatured in the production as "Nadia,
he 'ernptress," who succumbs to the
Ilst for gold, and the play is pre
,:nted in five daringly sensational
et of power and appeal. That the
wages of sin is death, is proven by
the life story of Nadia, who, lured
irom the straight, and narrow way to
the primrose p.th of ease and the love
of purple and thire linen, finally reaps
the tares and thistles of a misspent
life. The story of Nadia is a tale
that is sordid and yet fascinating; it
is a life sermon that is too often un
heeded, and yet we can never blind
our eyes to its significance. "As ye
sow, so shall ye reap," and still the
lure of wealth continues to be irresis
tible to many working girls.
*"Unto Those Who Sin" is heralded
as undoubtedly one of the strongest,
most realistic and best staged photo
plays of the kind that has ever been
rilmed, and a real treat is in store for
all who attend the Gem tonight.
For the convenience of clerks and
others whose Saturday night duties
may keep them employed until a late
hour, the theatre will remain open
tonight until 11:30 o'clock, thus af
fording everybody an opportunity to
see this sensational picture in full.
Alice Brady in "Tangled Fates."
Alice Brady, the dainty dramatic
artiste, will be the attraction at the

minister, to save her sister's good
name, resolves to assist her out of the

to the island, where she informs the
two lovers of their danger. Telling
Ruth to hurry back in the canoe,

stranger, The father, who is fond of
Ruth, is pleased to see that Ruth is
not there, but rebukes Jane and or

In the city Jane meets Blake, who
offers her assistance, which she re

of his customers named Rogers, and
asks him to give employment to Jane.
He does so, and shortly afterward
Will Rogers, the employer's son, falls
in love with Jane,subsequently marry

has to seek employment in order to
obtain the necessities of life.
Rogers hears of the gold drives in
Alaska, and desires to go there to
seek a fortune. Blake, now a pros
perous merchant, agrees to become
the grubstaker. Arriving in the
Klondike district, Rogers falls in with

proves very rich. With prosperity,
Rogers forgets wife and home. He
starts to have hilarious times
around the dance halls, where Blake
finds him when he comes to see why

money, telling her it is from her
husband. Believing this, ,lJane starts
for Alaska, arriving there just in time
to see the villagers preparing to
string her husband to a tree for a
cowardly attempt on another's life.
lier efforts to save him are futile, and
Rogers is hung after the fashion of
the mining camp laws.
Rogers' former girl and Jane have
a tussle in which the latter is in
Jired. After two weeks of convales
cing, she is able to return to New
York City, accompanied by Blake,
who had watched over her in her ill
ness, and now brings. to her the love
and happiress he had sought to give
her incee the eventful evening on the
island!

Emily Stevens in "Corn."
A renowned emotional actress in a
role that offers unlimited opportuni
ties for the display of dramatic talent
of the highest order is the rare com
bination presented in the superb Me
tro photoplay, "Cora," with Emily
Stevens portraying the stellar charac
ter, which is announced as the Sun
day attraction at the Grand.
Madame Renee, a fallen operatic
idol of Paris, comes to America with
her daughter, Cora, and dies soon
afterward, leaving Cora alone and in
destitute circumstances.
In the tenement house where Cora's
mother died there lives Marie and her
crippled sister, Louise, and they take
Cora to live with them. Marie is an
artist's model and poses for George
Garnier, a famous artist. The latter
is engaged to be married to Helen,
the daughter of a vy.$wealthy wo
man of high social standing, who has
arranged the marriage to satisfy het
social ambitions. The artist does not
lo. Ielen, but being tired of living
a lonely bachelor's life, he suffers his
~igage:ment to be announced. Helen
in turn does not love the artist, but
complies with her mother's wishes.
She is really in love with Carl Wilson,
a youiin club man who is a ne'er-do
well.
Cora strives to obtain employment
at a musical agency, as she has her
mother's voice, but grief overcomes
her, and she is unable to show the
true value of her voice.
Marie then takes Cora to pose for
the artist, who falls in love with her.
The girl to whom he is engaged passes
out of his mind, and he neglects her.
Helen and her mother decide to go to
him and demand an explanation.
They come to the studio and repri
mand him for his indifference. Cora,
who is in the model's dressing room,
overhears the conversation and real
ize., that the artist has deceived her.
She leaves him and starts life anew
on the operatic stage. The prima
donna of the company in which she
is an understudy meets death in an
automobile accident. This gives Cora
her chance and she becomes famous.
She then goes back to the tenement
district and takes Marie and her
crippled sister to her home to live
with her. After a mental struggle
with George's mother, Cora agrees
to break off her engagement with the
artist, and plans to kill his love for
her. To this end, she gives a Bohe
mian supper party in her apartment
to which she invites George and a fes
tite gathering of men and women.
I)uring *he course of supper she pays
marked attention to Jose, and ap
parently drinks too much wine.
Finally, during a d,,nce following the
supper, after George has been taunted
beyond endurance, he sees her in
Jose's arms. t.eorge breaks them
apart and demands an explanation.
Cora tells him she has on!y used him
as a plaything and laughs in his face.
I)i:tracted, George rushes from the
apartment to the .ilreet. After he
has gone, Cora breaks down and
drives hier guests from the rocn,.
Marie goes with them tq endeavor to
find George and explain the situation
to him, while Jose hides himself be
hind the curtains. After clgsing the
door upon her guests, Cora turns and
finds herself confronted by Jose, who
endeavors to take advantage of her
unprotectedness. A" terrific fight en
.sues, during the progress of which
Marie has found George, explained
the situation to hint and hurried hira
to the rescue.
George batters down the dpor to
Cora's bedroom just as, after a su
preme effort, Cora hurls a wine cooler
at Jos:o, which sends him reeling
through the window, where he falls
to the street below and is killed.
With horror she views the act, and
turning finds George at her side. In
the meantime IHeler .has eloped w4ith
Carl, thus enabling George ind CFpra
to become a ffianced.

'rhr_ Grand's feature attraction for
'hursday will be "Niobe," an elabo
rate five-part photo-adaptation of the
fanciful comedy of the same name,

Dawn, plays the title role. "Niobe"
is the story of a Greek statue that
co;mes to life and has a great deal of
armulsement-- and some sorrow--at

president of an insurance company,
,rings to his own house, for safe
I.eping, the precious statue of Niobe,
which his company has heavily insur
ed. Electricians wiring the house at
the time wrap the electric coils about

passes through the wires, bringing
the statue to life. The perfectly mor

and amusing position in trying to ex
plain to his shocked wife and other
members of his household the pres
ence of the scantily clad maid running
wildly through his home. At the
Lrucial moment of his misery. he
awakes. however, and findis Niobe in
her ancient and peaceful caondition.

havoc with the insurance company
president, Miss Dawn has numierous
and unequalled opportunities for the
display of her captivating pQwe!s.

are a railroad civil engineer and a
young woman, the owner of the rancn
through which the new railroad in
tends to pass. These two characters,
when they they meet, bring forth a
clash of will under circumstances
rarely seen on the screen. The fact
that they had previptisly loved each
other dearly, adds tq the intense in
terest of the plot. To the very end
she opposes the railroad company,
and ultimately triumphs, but eventu
ally she awakens to the greatness of
her love for the engineer, after he is
shot by one of her men in a thrilling
battle, and generously giving the
victory to the man whom she had al
ready defeated, she is herself respon

ofic e tqf assistant United States treas
urer at New Orleans, has beeft- ap
pointed by Gov. Pleasant as registrar

SWINE BREEDERS CONVENTION
Attractive Program Arranged For
Meeting in New Orleans.
Final plans for the convention of
the Louisiana Swine Breeders' Asso
[ciation, scheduled for Aug. 1, were
completed at a meeting of prominent
business men of New Orleans held in
the rooms of the Association of Com
merce. The latter body is doing
everything to make the meeting a
success from the standpoint of at
tracting a large attendance from
every parish in the state. Leading
hog raising experts from all over the
country will deliver addresses cover
ing every phase of the industry as ap
plied to conditions in Louisiana.
Aside from inviting the attendance of
all farmers interested in live stock,
an earnest invitation has been ex
tended to the boys' pig clubs, and the
most active members of these organi
zations will undoubtedly be delegates
to the convention.
Not only will interesting and in
structive addresses on methods of
hog raising and feeding be features
of the program, but in the afternoon
of Tuesday, Aug. 1, the delegates
will be taken to the stock yards and
abattoirs and there given a practical
demonstration of methods prevailing
in a modern packing-house that takes
a hog on the hoof and runs him
through to the refrigeration rooms
ready for the butcher's block.
Justin F. Denechaud, chairman of
the committee appointed by the A.sso
ciation of Commerce to handle the
meeting, looks for a large attendance
and permanent benefit to the swine
industry. "The Department of Agri
culture of our state is receiving daily
many inquiries for scientific informa
tion on hog raising from every sec
tion of the state and also from north
ern farmers who are interested in lo
cating in Louisiana. The forthcom
ing convention will be the most com
plete exposition of ideas on this sub
ject ever held in the southern states,
and any progressive farmer can ill
afford not to attend the gathering,
as he can learn more in a day from
the discussions than it would take him
six months to find out for himself."
Mayor Martin Behrman is co-op
erating with the committee in charge
of arrangements, and will make the
address of welcome. G. M. Rommell,
an official of the Bureau of Animal
Industry of the Department of Agri
culture, Washington, D. C., will be
sent to New Orleans to tell of the fed
eral government's interest in the
swine industry.
H. W. Munford, one of the leading
hog experts of America, will address
the convention on a subject that will
appeal to sugar, cotton, rice and oth
er planters all over the state. The
title of Mr. Munford's address will be,
"Starting Right in the Hog Industry."
- Other addressev will be made by O.
P. Geren, president of the Louisiana
Swine Breeders' Association; Harry
D. Wilson, commissioner of agricul
ture; Dr. W. R. Dodson, Dr. E. P.
Flower, Prof. E. L. Jordan, Prof. W.

IN MEMORIAM.
Passing Away of Little Roberta Miller
Sincerely Mourned.
Died, at Dupont, La., on Sunday,
July 2, 1916, Annie Roberta Miller,
eldest daughter of Hugh Miller and
Annie Evans, aged 3 years, 4 months
and 6 days.
It has been said that the old must,
the young may die. And while the
deep shadow of death comes over us
when death comes and takes away one
of our loved ones, yet peculiarly sad
it is when the young is taken from us.
For a few short years God entrust
ed Roberta to our care, filling our
hearts with love and our homes with
sunshine; then when her presence
seemed essential to our happiness,
God transplanted her soul pure and
immortal to His celestial garden,
where sorrow cometh not and all is
peace and sunshine.
The void left cannot be filled-yet
we would not call her back, for in
paradise she awaits us, her little hand
beckoning us on. For ten days Rob
erta lay ill, never seriously sick-
worse one day, seemingly better the
next, so no apprehension was felt for
her condition. Surrounded by those
who loved her-father, mother and
grandparents-she was conscious to
the end, displaying to all the love and
affection that causes her memory one
to be cherished.
All that medical skill could do was
administered by one who was both
physician and friend, but the Savior
who said, "Suffer little children to
come unto Me, for of such is the
kingdom of heaven," wanted her for
His own, and we who believe "He
doeth all things well" must bow to
His holy will.
Sunday afternoon at 6 o'clock
Roberta was laid to rest in St. Mary's
cemetery, New Roads, La. The
beautiful and impressive burial ser
vice of the Episcopal church was con
ducted by Rev. Dr. Prosser, who had
loved and petted her. -
There's a land that is fairer than day,
A land where no sorrpw can come,
Where our Savior His love does dis
play,
Where he calls his dear children
come home.
On this beautiful shore she i, waiting
for us,
And bids us not grieve for her
more;
For she stands with the angels in
glory and love
And beckons us to that glad shore.
ONE WHO LOVED HER.

Are You Guilty?
The newspapers of every commun
ity are doing the most of the fighting
in favor of local business as against
the mail order houses of the country.
To reward the local press for, its loyal
and consistent support many of the
business men of this and every other
community in Louisiana are buying
their printing and blanks from mail
order houses in New Orleans, Shreve
port and cities even. more distant.
Every dollar sent out of town for the
purchase of any material that is spld
here is added to the resources the
business men of other cities are using
to fight the growth and expansion of
business here. The papers are going
to keep right on doing their duty to
the home people and they have the
undoubted right to expect patronage
and support in return.-Adapted

Taking Big Chances.
It is a great risk to travel without
a bottle of Chamberlain's Colic,
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy, as
this preparation cannot be obtained
on the trains or steamships. Attacks
of bowel complaint are often sudden
and very severe, and everyone should
go prepared for them. Obtairiable

VOTES FOR WOMEN.
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Conference.
417 Camp Street, New Orleans.
States Rights and Woman's Bailot.
The first historic mile-stone for the
Southern States Woman Suffrage
Coniference was reached when. on
Friday, June 16, 1916, the Demo
cratic party went on record as recom
mending "the extension of the fran
chise to women." That the method
was by states is in line with the basic
principles of the party. That the Re
publican party, the week preceding,
should have taken the initiative in
prescribing the states rights route, is
confirmatory of the unanimity with
which our political parties recognize
the line of least resistance for the
inevitable coming of the ballot to wo
men. Opponents generally realize
that votes for women is a logical and
essential component of Democracy.
On methods only do advocates differ.
Since there has been such singular
unanimity on the state-by-state meth
od advocated by Republicans as by
Democrats, future action is clear for
the suffragists in the states east and
south. The west is not concerned,
since this section has already enfran
chised its women. Southern women
who are intelligent on political rat
ters will aprove earnestly of states
rights continuance in all things af
fecting the electorate. It is the most
sensitive chord of the Democratic
party and a fundamental of its origin.
It is the basis. upon which Jefferson
built his precepts and upon which his
followers tenaciously stand. What
ever qualificationsare laid downfor
men in exercising citizenship . rights
can be met by women, and in justice
cannot be denied. Even the specious
argument that force should be 4n, ac
companiment of voting extensijot, is
now an absurdity when a host of -wo
men are engaged in Red Cross. and
defense work-and many votersa.ae
shunning recruiting offices.
Convention at Atlantic City.
All the states affiliated with the
National American Woman Suffrage
Association are invited to send dele
gates to the annual convention to be
held in Atlantic City, September.6-10,
inclusive. It has been customary to
hold the annual meeting of this or
ganization during the winter season,
but in view of the part the suffragists
may decide to take in the presidential
election in November, it has been
deemed expedient to hold the conven
tion preceding the election. All the
political parties have put planks in
their respective platforms endorsing
the ballot for women.
Women Army Cooks.
Five hundred more women have
been accepted by the British war of
fice as army cooks, and will soon be
sent to the front to join 1500 others
who have been satisfying Tommy's
appetite. These women wear khaki,
and live in camps and barracks. If
the country needs these women in its
time of stress it ought to recognize
them in its privileges and councils.
SUNDAY SCHOOL CONVENTION.
Fourth Division of District Associa
tion to Meet Next Month

vention with the New River Church

ercises.
Let us pray this will be the best
convention held within the entire dis
trict, and that we may receive a
broader vision of service through the
Sunday School.
The following will serve on the pro
gram: O. B. Webb, New Orleans,
general passenger agent, Texas & Pa
cific Railway Co.; H. L. Baker, Plat
tenville; Mrs. Grant Williams, Brig
nac; George Williams, New River
Church; Miss Willie Lee Rowan, dis
trict field worker; G. W. Edmonston,
