modern structure of its kiiuNn Now
Mexico, according to the blue prints
and specillealions, which are in the
hands of the Clayton Construction
Company, who luwe the contract for
the building. .
The .structure will be conrrete for
the first twelve feet ftom the ground
level, and heavy frames of timber
will support the iron 'which will
complete the super-structure. An
excavation of eight feet is necessary
for the wagon dump and to obtain
head room for the four immense
Istorage bins of 3000 bushels capacity
'each. v
Besides the four immense bins
ther'e will be four smalh r bins in the
super-structure of a capacity of l.CU
bushels each. All these bins will be
connected by modern systems of
tranferiug grain from one to the
other, or from the dump to any one
of tin-in, and from any one or all of
them to the cars, in the form of
draw and cup elevatois and endless
belts, with trippers and stops.
The wagon dump will be of the
latest and most approved construc
tion and this feature is one which
will bo appreciated by the farmer
more, than any other. The dump
Will have a wcigh-hnskct ' directly
underneath, to hold the cram or
other, produce. This wclgh-haskct
et is connected with accurate scab s
and as the (are of the basket never
varies, the net weight of the grain is
nsm-tainod with far greater accur
acy and despatch than wln-u the
wagon, in't be 'vc'is.-li"d ' hack' to
ascertain the tare. J I will not only
' not bo necessary to sack the grain
before delivery, but will be more
convenient not to do so as the grain
will run from the wagon box of its
own accord when the dump is trip
ped. The dump wil be safeguarded
Jm e,ery possible manner so that
teams of nervous disposition will
not take fright and cannot possibly
be injured. It is estimated that a
load of grain can be dumped and
weighed a. id a check written for the
amount due thedelivering party in
less than one minute and thirty
seconds.
Electric power will be used thru
out and the enclosure covering the
wagon dump as well as the entire
building will be adequately lighted
to faciliate the handling of produce
after dark, during the short fall and
winter days.
The storage room, in which will be
installed the cleaning machinery,
will also be electrically equipped and
the ceaning machinery will be of the
latest desi
irn.

I BEATY I ROES RAISING OF II0GÜ
IN UNION COUNTY
County Agent in First Cominmiicnt
lon to Tress States That Hoy
Raising Is Needed
In the dry-fanning sections of
'New Mexico where grain forms the
principle crop w e have need of more
Iiols to wliich to feed the grain. Ev
erywhere thru the country we llnd
a scarcity of hogs. This is probably
'accounted for by the fact that there
.are no pastures to run the hogs on.
I But. such pastures can be had and
we should have them. Hogs, penned
and grain fed from the time they
are weaned they are a money losing
proposition, "They eat their heads
off is Ihe way the farmers express
it.
The ideal way to raise hogs is to
have an alfalfa or sweet clover pas
ture (o run the pigs through tho
sumiller, or until they are large en
ough to faten. Such a pasture, sup
plemented by a small amount of
grain daily, keeps the pig growing
and the frame work of tho bos
I will be produced on cheap feed.
Then when the desired frame work
lis seemed increase the grain ral
! ion and fallen the hogs for market.
I Corn is. an ideal grain to supple
jiiienl, the pasture. Jt supplies tho
J ii'-cessary csrhonacious food to mako
la hallenced ration with the alfalfa
and sweet clover pasture. z
' A I fulfil and sweet, clover do well
'in I liion County. Alfalfa thai,-was
I seeded in I'nioii County six years
nun stands fourteen inches high, at
lliis time. That makes a lot of pas
lure for iiogs. The alfalfa wa seed
ed broadcast mu ; . ..i1 ! have been
in much better conditon for pastur
age had t been planted n rows and
culitxled. The same is true of sweet
clover. It. all does well, but that in
row s does much belter. 1 would rec
onieiid that alfalfa and sweet clove j
be planted in rows from ?' to 'Jo
inches apart. .
Take ten acres of land with good
deep soil for your pasture and fence
it. with rabbit and hog proof fence,
l'low it deep in tho fall and leave
i gh thru the winter to catch the
suowIu the spring, before it drys.
out, cull is ate it to preserve the mois
ture and to keep the weeds in check.
Along in June, July or August, when
your rainy season set in, seed it.
I'se a grain drill with tho glass
seed.M- attachment and plant the
seed into the moist soil, seeding
from six to eight pounds to the acre.
It will soon come up and make a
quick growth. Cultivate it thru the
summer enough to preserve the
moisture and to hold the weeds in
check. The last cultivation in the fall
should bo done with larger shovels
in order to ridge the soil to prevent
blowing and hold the snow. In the
spring before it drys, disk it lightly
and harrow it level. It will start
early in the season and when it is
well started ring your hogs and turn
them into it, being careful not to
over stock your field.

Knaddler, the Liberal pitcher,
imported by the Giants for the
game, allowed the Blues only
two. hits. Morton.on the mound
for the Blues was little more
liberal and allowed the Giants
but four. Six errors by the
