menaced friendly relations.

Carranza in an interview to-day said
that the status of the negotiations with
i Washington was very satisfactory, as
the result of the good will shr?wn to
each other by Mexiro and the United
States.
"Thanks to this feeling of gotfd will,"
the first chief continued, "we will be
able to avoid war. War is something
1 do not desire, but if there were no
: other remedy for the situation, 1 would
enter upen it."
General Carranza; however, refused
to discuss the situation as it relates
to the possible action of President
Wilson or of the l.atin-American na
tions. which offered to mediate in the
trouble between the I'nited States and
Mexico.
Within a short time, the first chief
said, there would he incorporated in
the Constitution of Mexico all tin* "re
forms which now find a place in the
program of the Constitutionalists.
General Carranza said a presidential
election would take place as soon as
the work of reconstructing the Con
stitution had been completed and when
ihe country was completely at peace.
The de facto government, the First
Chief said, will piss a law of amnesty,
so that all Mexicans who have left
the country for one reason or another
can return if they desire. Such a law '
however, he said, would not be pro-'
mulgated as Ioiht as the government
was not on a firm basis, for the reason
that among some <>f Hie Mexicans now
living abroad there are those who
would return to Mexico to conduct j
agitat ions.
"As for myself, personally. I do not
care," General Carranza declared, "but
I do care on account of the govern-'
ment and the country. The work of
bringing about the political reconstruc
tion of Mexico is most difficult, and !
must be carried forward under peace- j
ful conditions."

be left behind here for the present at
least. When these organizations are
rounded out to their full compliment
of men, they may he sent after the
other State troops.
Although Adjutant-General Sale in
tends to recommend to the War De
partment that the militia now in Camp
Stuart be sent away, it is not certain
that immediate action will be taken
on account of the great amount of
business passing through the hands of
the department. The men may not go
at all. and if they so there will prob
ably be some delay in arranging for
the trip. Whether the soldiers sro IO
the border or t?? some regular train

is probable that several months at

LOSSES COMPARATIVELY SMALL
nonilixrrliHont rf Teutons on Belgian
Front Roaches Point of
Oroatest Intensity.
After the briefest preliminary bom
bardment which has proccrt^d any im
portant action on the western front.
j the British armies nn the Somme have
, again swept forward. and have cap
|tured several important G?rman second
| positions. On a front of four miles the
, British have advanced to a depth of a
mile, and have held all positions gained,
in spite of violent counterattacks.
The strategic importance of the
British successes is marked by the
straightening of their line In con
formity with that of the French, who
had hitherto advanced at a much
creater spe*,l than their allies. The '
brevity of the preliminary bombard
ment. coupled with the statements of
press correspondents at the front that
'he British losses were comparatively
small, lend support to unofficial state
ments that the German second line was
I much less strongly fortified than their
I first defenses.
| \? ACTION OK IMI'OUTAXCE
ox Tim riiii.vrH portio.v
|nn tlie French portion of the Somme
front no action of importance was
recorded, but in the French official
statement for Ft Ida.v It \yas announced
that the bomhardment of German posi
tions on the Belgian front had reached
i point of the greatest Intensity.
This announcement receives addi
tional significance, as for more than a
week the Me Ik lans have reported a per
sistent and destructive bombardment
j directed against the German fortifica
tions. These announcements were
i similar t.? those made by the British
| preceding the opening of their great
. offensive, and may possibly indicate
| that another big forward movement by
tiie entente allies may be attempted at
the extreme western end of the bat
j tie line.
Another point of significance in the
| day's official war reports is that the
I only actions reported on the Verdun
| fronts were assaults made by the
French.
! These assaults were noted In the Ger
I man official statement, which made no
I claim of any German offensive action.

IX TIIK STOKHOD BATTLE
[ On the Russian front the battle of
the Stokhod is still raging with the
issue remaining in the balance.
The most important news from the
Russian side is in regard to the opera
tions in the Caucasus. Grand Duke
XK'holas reports continuous and sub
stantial successes against the Turks,
and apparently is launching another
. .eat offensive in the region of
lO.-Kcrum and Baiburt. aimed at the
verv heart of Hie Turkish empire. A
1 successful Russian advance along this
line would cut off the Turkish armies
in the south and again place Bagdad
in Jeopardy.
MOW OFFENSIVE OPEXEI)
at daws iiv nniTisn
j l.< I.vnu.v, Jtily H?The British
opened a new offensive at dawn to-day,
and after hours of heavy fighting they
made a steady gain, being in possession
to-night of the German second posi
tion- from Itazentin-le-Petit to Lon
gucval. both inclusive, and the whola
of Tronev wood A number of pris
oners- weie taken, including two colo
nels and other superior officers. Ac
cording to press correspondents at the
front. fight iiir was continuing hotly
late to-day.
Appropriately, on the day of the
French national fete, when every Lon
doner wore In his buttonhole a tri
color ribbon ii honor of hts allies,
caine the sti.rlng news of the success
ful British attack on the German
second line.
The Associated Press correspondent
at the front describes the attack as ^
surpassing that of July \ as a great ' j
spectacle and thrilling display of artil
lery power. Characteristic of the
lighting Cnouphout the battle of the
.-'o.- nie, the Germans appeared to bt
unable io b.iug up sufficient reserves
to make successful counterattacks. A
second poii\t which is emphasized by
ohbervers on the allied side is that in
the fighting at close quarters tho
Germans surrender freely.
Dispatches from Sir Douglas Haig
and from the press correspondents
show that the fighting has again been fl
of the heaviest character At one time .'2
the Germans, by a furious courlttr- \
attack, succeeded In driving the British
out of Baientln-le-Fetlt. They wero ^
