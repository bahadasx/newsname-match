The President Out
On The Range
THE President in his
speeches this week
is waimly defending the
"Federal Act" and as
sumes that it enables
men to obtain credit
on good securities, and
thinks it saved the
country from a mighty
panic, when the Eu
ropean war burst upon
the world.
He huggs himself
for the wisdom of that
act, and counts it a
mighty factor in the
present campaign. But
he does not explain
why there was such a
depression upon the
country when that war
was sprung. We were
threatened by no war;
no pestilence was rag
ing; the harvest was a
bountiful one. Why
should we have been
thieatened by a great
panic at that time?
Was it not because
the assaults upon the
tariff had closed so
many factories, and be
cause the ships of for
eigners being interned,
there was no way in
sight to ship our sur
plus products to a mar
ket? And what has he
and his party done
since then to defend
I our skilled laborers
against direct competi
tion by naked savages,
and unpaid serfs, and
where is our merchant
marine to do our carry
ing trade on the sea,
to supply the countries
1 that need our northern
food products, and the
products of our skilled
laborers, and to pay us
in the products which
they have for sale?
The President tells
of the superior intelli
gence of his party, but
makes no reference to
the promises made by
it in 1912. If we re
member correctly, we
weie to have a great
merchant marine that
was to run and pros

DEVER did a more aggressive business man and public spirited citizen come to Utah than
Charles A. Quigley, owner and manager of the automobile sales agency which bears his
name; a man whose spoken word is equivalent to a signed contract; a man who always
aggressive, always outspoken, wields a vast influence upon the whole community because
the fact has been impressed that his imerring ability is backed by an integrity of purpose of which
there is no question,
"Charlie" Quigley came to Utah in 1894 as the manager of the Studebaker company in the in
termountain region and for a score of years conducted the busints.... in Salt Lake with unusual suc
cess. About two years ago he entered the business field for himself, establishing the agency on
Exchange Place which bears his name, and carrying to it the vast energy, ability and good-fellowship
which had marked his success with the Studebakers.
Mr. Quigley was born in Dubuque, Iowa, Juno G, 18G2, the son of Dr. John P. and Margaret A.
Quigley. His grandfather, Patrick Quigley, was the first settler in Dubuque and really was th,e
founder of that city, later serving as member of the first Iowa legislature. "Charlie" received his
first rudiments of learning in the common schools and high school of Dubuque. He then entered
the employ of A. A. Cooper of the Cooper Wagon and Buggy company, as a bookkeeper and office man
and held the place for six years after which he entered the employ of the Studebakors and remained

subsidies, a tariff re- H
vision that would not H
be a menace to any le-
gitimate business, an in- H
come tax to reduce the H
taxation of the masses, H
a general curtailment of H
unnecessary public ex- H
penitures; cheaper cost H
of living for the masses. jH
None of us can forget H
the rosy picture. H
And what has come of H
the promises? Thou- H
sands of people denied H
the chance to work H
through the closing of
the factories; no mer- H
chant marine, not one H
ship built through any H
legislation that prom- H
ised to make the run- H
ning of ships possible, H
the income tax bringing H
in immense revenues, H
but every dollar spent H
in the current expense H
of the party of H
economy; surely the
President must have H
taken aboard a double M
cargo of assurance H
when he started on this M
voyage. M
But he grows elo M
quent in chanting the j
anthems of peace, and M
becomes an artist in H
picturing the loveliness M
of generous negotiations M
in settling difficulties. H
Has he any patent M
on his love of peace? M
Would he feed soothing M
syrup to a Bengal tiger H
if not assured in ad- H
vance that the cage H
around the tiger was H
strong enough to hold H
him? M
Could Custer have H
stopped Sitting Bull by H
reading him the Sermon H
on the Mount. H
Sitting Bull was not jH
as much cultivated, but H
his heart was as true
as are the heaits of the
men who are raiding H
our Mexican border, H
killing the men and H
women and running off H
their stock. jH
Peace is very lovely, H
but in dealing with bri- H
gands before it can be H
secured, the brigands H
have to learn that . H
order and law are the H
first essentials to make H
peace secure. H
