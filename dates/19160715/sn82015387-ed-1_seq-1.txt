Expenses of Flood
Draw Heavily on
Police Jury.
Covington and S . Tammany parish
generally suffered little from the late
storm in comparisbn to other south
ern sections, ejeciatally Alabama.
Even Ashville, in the mountains of
North Carolina, suffered from over
law of the Broad River. Covington
showed its excellent drainage by the
fact that the water drained off with
in a few hours after the water ceased
rising, the fall being-as rapid as the
rise.
The police Jury of .the parish met
a few days ifter the storm, as soon
as it could be called together, to de
vise ways and means of relieving the
situation, geting bridges back and
roads in condition. The fact thai
the parish has just spat considerable
money in putting evedything in first
class condition, savqs little avail
sable money for the *aster that hat
just overtaken us, A aIll be shown
by the folowing siatement:

LIDDLE WRITES
OF HIS TRIP IN
THE EAST
Tells of Handsome School
Buffdings, Visit to Former
Home of Mrs. McDaniel.
Pittaburg, Pa., July 7, 1916.
Editor,St. Tammany Farmer:
I arrived in this great busy, bustl
ing and hustling city on the 4th of
July evening. That night rode
around in an auto with my overcoat
and witnessed the grandest display
f fireworks of my life.
On the evening of the 4th we saw
a military parade in Oincinnati, the
former home of patriotic Mrs. M.
McDnliel and sisters, of Slidell. It
also reminded me that the freedom
of our great country is owing largely
to the hyphen inftence--the Irish
American and also French-American.
All day, along the route, we saw
evidences of the glorious 4th cele
.bration--parades, lags, picnics and
happy people.
We are,now more than a thousand
miles from Slidell\ and to get here
traveled in the state of Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee,
Kentu.ky, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
Farming and stock-raislng and man
ulacturing are largely in evidence.
The corn seems small to me, but sup
pose it was planted late or due to
or due to the climatic influance.
Sixty degrees yesterday and I see
it was ninety in New Orleans. Palm
iBeach suits are not ready to market
here yet.
I passed by a million dollar new
school building yestebray and wished
for Supt. Lyon and all our school
people to see it. Also rode by the
home of Harry K. Thaw and "57 Va
riety Heinz."
Yesterday I went into the heart of
the city and got acquainted with the
L. & L. & G., and the Home Insur
ance people. They made dates to
take me into custody, and I feel that
I am insured a good t!me with 'Em.
This is an iron, oil and coal sec
tion-evidences in every direction.
Many "war brides," known better as
war munition factories, are here.
There are thousands of large plants
of various Industries, some $20,000,
000.00 concerns.
This is also a seCtion of hills and
valleys-some of the grandest seen
ery in the world-splendid aoto
roads, and Ford's also ramble along
-and the Ford owner buys gasoline
at twenty cents a gallon. Mr. Fort
and Mr. Rockefeller must be good
friends.
I expect to visit some of the steel
mills and also to witness the manu
facture of war munitions. May also
run around the country some-tc
Washington, Philadelphia and At
lantle City, only ten doliars away,
and Niagara Falls Just five dollars
distant.
I read the Times-Pic every day
and it is Just like a letter from home

THE SMILETHAT
IS ALWAYS
THERE
The Laurel Wreath Is Voted
to D. M. Montgomery for
Cheerful Hard Luck.
rMr. D. M. Montgomery le one of
the cheelzul members of the Covinl
ton social system. He has a smile
that even the flood and storm could
not remove. The loss of four or fliv
hundred of his flock of one thousand
pure-bred chickens only flecked it for
a moment with an expression of dis
apptintment. He is true blue when
it comes to standing up under the
burden of loss and disappointment:
but his friends have been afraid t_
look at him sinee Wednesday morn
ing. Afraid they weould fnd the smile
gone. It took a case-hardened re
porter of The St. Tammany Farmei
to look him squarely in the face and
record the fact that the smile was
still there.
'Mr. Montgomery has kept pretty
well in touch with modern means o'
warfare. If there was anything new
in that line he thought he would flin
it in the dispatches of German
achievement. Hence he was in nc
apprehension of being injured when
he picked up a hammer and hatchet
and staUted to open a box ofat mer
chandise. He inserted the hatche
beneath the cover and swung at I
with the hammer. There was a
bright spark and a stinglng sensa
tion on the bleeps of the left arms
A smali piece of steel about one-six
teenth of an inch in diameter flew
from the hatchet, passed through his
shirt sleeve and buried itself about
half an inche deep in the flesh, c~t
ting a vein from which the blood
flower freely. Dr. Gautreaux probed
for the piece of metal, but was un
alble to find it. This is not half as
important, however, as the fact that
Mr. Montgomery is still cheerful and
smiling and fullaf coonidence in the
goodness of all things. We say.
hurrah! Give us some more of the
Montgomery temperament.

SIDELL SCHOOL
TAX CARRIES
MAJORITY
List of Those Who Voted
-For and voted Against
the Proposition.
Special to The Farmer:
Slidell, La., July 12.-The schdol
tax carried by a large majority of a
very small vote at the polls. The
weather was not at all favorable to
getting out the Ifll vote for It rain=
ed throughout the whole noon hour,
thus cutting off the opportunity of
many who expected to vote at that
time.
The legal hour of closing the polls
was not noted by many and several
voters 'were disappointed at not be
ing able to cast their ballots between
five and six o'clock.
The schools of the Ninth Ward are
now sure of the full nine months
session for the next two years and
opes are felt that finances may be
improved to better conditions during
the life of the tax.
Alterations are being made at the
high school building in Slidell with
a view toward accommod ting a
greatly increased high ae.col de
partment as well as a general in
crease in the grades. At present it
seems that the school will open with
very nearly five hundred pupils.
The increased funds will probably
be taxed to their limit to care for
the large increase in enrollment cx
ipected.
JNames of those voting for and
against the tax follow, together with
a summary of the results of the
election:

Flatboat Now Used
for Crossing River
at Covington.
There is a fiat boat at the sight of
the old Covington bridge which is
answering the purpose of a ferry;
but teams can not cross. The replac
inug o the bridge is now under way,
in charge of Mr. J. M .Currie. The
temporary bridge will probably be
finished by next Wednesday. Work
wlM then be carried on to replace
the steel bnidge. Teamns and auto
mobiles are crossing the Tehefuncta
bridge, and the bridge at Abita
Springs. Louis Wehril, Sr., says an
eautmobile can't cross the Abita
bridge on the Mandeville read, but
halt a Ford ean. .

MORPHY SWIMS
RIVER TO GET
TO FAMILY
Arrives From New Orleans
On Evening Train and is
Shut Out by Flood.
Mr. L. A. Morphy, attorney-at-law
who has omcfes n fNew Orleans and
a family residence in Covington,
came over from New Orleans on the
evening N. O. O. N. train, last Fri
diy, but when he teeched Abita
Springs be was told that the trestle
was under Water sad it was too dan
gerous for a train to cross. He man
aged to cross the Abita river, how
ever, and walked as far as Mr. Jones'
residence In Clatborne, where he
stayed for the naght. Hardy in the
morning he started out for his home
in Covington, not knowing that his
family had been rescued from the
house the evening before. He was
unable to cross the Boget Falaya
river, the bridge being swept away,
so he walked as far as the Kent
place and then swam the river. He
found the this home had been sub
merged and he saw no signs of his
family. HIe was delighted when he
reached Dr. Tolson's place and found
his family there, sate and sound.
He had a pretty tough time 6f it, an
experience he will act soon forget.
But there was pleasure in knowing
every one was safe.
