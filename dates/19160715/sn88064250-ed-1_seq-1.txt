ST. CHARLES TO INSTALL
AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT
Grand Coteau College Will Educate
Boys in Art of Scientifically
Tilling the Soil.
It is reported that St. Charles
College has definitely decided to
install an agricultural department.
For the past several years Rev.
Father M. A. Grace, the esteemed
president of that famous institu
tion, has been considering the ad
visability of opening up the col
lege to those who are desirous of
becoming scientific farmers.
The St. Charles College Alumni
Association, at its ansual meeting
in Grand Coteau in June, decided
to investigate the matter and read
ily appointed a committee to see
whether the funds for the opera
tion of this department could not
be made available.
The committee appointed at the
June meeting of the association met
at Lafayette on last Sunday and it
is stated that several hundred dol
lars has already been raised, E.
M. Boagni, of this city having
pledged six hundred ,dollars, paya
ble annually for three years, to the
cause. , Marshall Billeaud, of
Broussard, followed Mr. Boagni's
example and readily pledged a like
amount. It is understood that sev
eral other prominent members of
the association have pledged
amounts varying from fifty dollars
up.
The good fathers of the Grand
Coteau College realize that the col
lege can accomplish much for
Louisiana by assisting ambitious
boys to learn the art of tilling the
soil sci.entifically and profitably and
for that reason did not hesitate to
approve of the- action of the alumni
association.
The department, will in all prob
abilities, be opened at the ,same
time the college boys return to
their duties during the next school
term.
If St. Landry were to establish a
department of ariculture, like the
one soon to be opened by the Grafid
Coteau it would call for an outlay, of
with its, corp of splendid profess
'irs is doing a great thing for the
betterment of agricultural condi
tions in St. Landry.
Grand Coteau. July 12.--On Sun
day last Rev. M. A, Grace, S. J.
President of the St. Charles College.
of Grand Coteau, went to Lafayette
as an ex-officio member of °the
committee of five selected by the
President of the Alumni Associa
tion of St. Charles. to see to the
ways and means of raising two
thopsand dollars a year 'for three
years to help finance the Agricul
tural Department, which the Co:
lege authorities are anxious to es
tablish in the near future.
The following gentlemen gra
ciously served on the committee:
Mr. E. M. Boagni, chairman, Ope
lousas.
Mr. M. Biileaud, Broussard.
Mr. O. Broussard, Rayne.
Mr. T. Colomb, 'Lafayette.
Mr. F. Dimmick, Shuteston.
Father Grace reported a very en
thusiastic conference. The com-
mittee has agreed to put up out of
their own funds $500.00 a year for
three consecutive years. The- fol
lowing plan to raise t'he other
$1500.00 a year was agreed upon.
Thirty members of the Alumni are
to be askea to guarantee fifty dol
lars a year for three fears.
A form of guarantee will be
drown up and this t~hey will be
asked to sign. They will be at lib
erty to get the Alumni and the
friends of the College in their re
spective sections to help them.
Everything points to t'he irpmedi
ate raising of the funds- and to the
early opening of the department.
The College feels that St. Lan
dry and the adjacent parishes will
welcome this new department of
old St. Charles with great accla
mat ion. Back to the farm is the
cry not only of the Catholic Church
,but also of our own Pelican State.
Such a department will go far to
solving the difficulty so many of
our boys encounter when finishing
up collece. The courses will be so
shaped that our boys will not ionly
take in book knowledge, but also
and especially a practical working
knowledge of the farm.

NEW PARISH JOINS
WITH ST. LANDRY
People and Politicians of Evangeline, Irrespective of Fac
tional Alignment, Demand That A Change
Be Made In Judicial Officers
The recent announcement of the
candidacies of Peyton R. Sandoz for
district judge and John W. Lewis
for district attorney, according to
reports at hand, have elicited fav
orable response from every sec
tion of Evangeline parish. Irrespect
ive of former factional alignrient,
the people are loud in their de
mands for the defeat of the incum
bents of the two offices mentioned.
These reports from the new par
ish indicate that the demand is a
loud one, not confined to any par
ticular faction. Wherever the sup
porters of Messrs. Sandoz and Lewis
go they find the same sentiment
prevailing-a sentiment favorable
to the candidacies of the two Opel
ousas attorneys who have announc
ed in opposition to Judge Pavy and
District Attorney Garland.
In view of this insistent demand
from Evangeline, it would not be
THE INTELLIGENT M4NAGE
MENT OF A PUBLIC
INDUSTRY
The interest of people in public
affairs is considerably heightened
when they learn that 'he revenues
of the government are wisely and
judiciously managed. A statement
of economical expenditure which is
susceptible of proof will always at
trfct attention and please the
thoughtful reader.
Among the varied industrial en
terprises of the post office depart
mnent in Washington is an estab
manufacture of mail locks and the
bag attachments used in mail trans
portation. When this adminis
tration came into power, the de
partment sorely needed an im
proved type of mail lock. The shop
was immediately reorganized, plac
ed on a business basis, and its ac
tivities enlarged so as to ineet this
imperative demand. Within a very
short time a new and greatly im
proved lock had been devised and
its production begun.
The lock in use weighed 5 1-2
ounces; the new one weighs 2 4-5
ounces. As 430,000 of this new
product have been put into service,
the difference in weight (the gov
ernment paying as much for the
weight-of equipment as it does for
the mail itself) can be easily cal
culated. The locks replaced by this
new and better style cost 21 cents
each to make, those now being man
ufactured cost- 8 1-2 cents, direct
and the indirect charges considered,
the saving thus show on original
cost of production to date amount
ing to $53,750. Of the old style, 36,
000 Were annually returned for re
pair at a cost of about 9 cents
each. Of the new style, out of the
great number sent into service, but
906 have been returned, arid as these
iew style locks can be repaired at
a cost of 3 cents each, the annual
saving on this item will amount to
over $2,100.
The department has in this ad
ministration encouraged its em
ployees to give their best service
to the government and many in
stances have recently come to no
tice wherein the department has
gratly profited by this wise piublic
policy. In. the lock shop, a recent'
achievement in. this direction is axY
improved cord fastener, the work of
three of its employees, for use on
bags; also one designed for locking
large qutantities. of parcel post
post matter, which has heretofore
been without this protection. It
can be made at a very low price,
requiring less material and a fewer
number of operations. The signifi
cant part of this lies in' the great
number required in the service, be
tween three and four millions, the
output being 500,000 annually. As
the cost has been reduced by the
new method from 4 1-2 to 3 cents
each, it will be seen whaf: a splendid
sbowinw 'this makes for adminis
trative econory.
Another valuable improvement
has been the perfectinw locking
cord fastener designed for rse on
tie sacks, something which the de
partment for years has nqeded and
vainly endeavored to accomplish.
.TThiq device will be of great ser
vice to the postal service at laree
by increasing the capacity and effi
amiss to remark that the people of
the new parish are but voicing the
sentiments,.in this instanc, of those
of the peopletof St. Landry. In other
words, Evangeline has joined hands
with St. Landry to bring about a
change in the two juidicial offices.
The sentiments this expressed are
echoed from every section of St.
Landry as well, and all that we
'hear is not so much the political
strength of Sandoz and Lewis as the
political weekness of Pavy and Gar
land.
It is claimed that much of this
Ball for a change is occasioned by
the fact that long tenure of office
is undemocratic and if a change is
desirable now is the time. Mr. Gar
land has held the position of dis
trict attorney for twenty years
five full terms of four years each;
while Judge Pavy has been on the
bench some six years, filling a vac
ciency of mail vags to a degree
difficult to estimate. The modern
system of business methods and the
proper encouragement of employees
to take an active and earnest in
terest in their work, both of which
desirable features this adminis
tration of the department has
favored and put into practice,; is
responsible for the many improve
ments made and the advantages
gained.
Active experifen$ts are constantly
being made for the betterment of
the service. For ° yeara
tremendous ,
I ~e immense quantity
of mail bage in use. The form of
label used in the past and still used
by clerks all over the country is
the doubling and refolding of what
is known as a "facing slip." The
preparation of these labels by the
thousands has been and is an ex
pensive proposition, yet t~here ap
pears to have been no effort on the
part of previous administrations to
progress from the old method.
Under present direction a perxfo
rated label in sheets and runs hag
been designed which is practically
ready for sue when needed by em
ployees. Every postal clerk in the
country and thousands of post of
fice employees will find this new
method of great advantage and it
will result in a .large economy in
the service.
Trere have also been some other
notable improvements made, viz:
the substitution of steel where
brass was formerly used, at a very
considerable lessening of expe'nse;
a device for fasteniig foreign mail
pouches, doing away with the old
fashioned method of string and seal,
a scheme for saving saving twine
by means of a simple 'holder which
permits free and easy use without
waste, and a rlexible stamp de
sign, for which the contract price
was 34 cents, but which will now be
made at a cost of but 8 cents. A
cechanical pickup or facing table
for use in facing and stacking let
ters in first-class post offices has
also been developed and will soon
be perfected. This device is con
sidered superior to those now in
use and costs less than one-third as
much to manu'facture. Those at
present in use cost approximately
Jl,500.
It will thus he seen t'hat the ace
tivities of the post office depart
ment have been centered along lines
which will not only produce large
economies to the people of the
country, but will also prove a great
convenience to those in the serrvice.
During the past two years two ob
jects have been kept constantly in
view, viz: saving the public money
wherever possible and serving the
people to tlhe fullest extent. There
was room for grqeat improvem~ent
and there has been much acceim
plished. It is but common justice
'to award due credit in these ad
ministrative reforms to the fourth
assistant postmaster general, in
whose bureau these measures of
economy were developed and who
has so faithfully devoted his time
to that purpose.

Perrault.. Notwithstanding their vig
orous activity in the parish cam
paign in 1912 they were renominat
ed, without opposition in the fall
election, thus being given their yes
pective offices without the necessity
of entering a heated campaign for
same. As a matter of fact, Mr. Gar
land has been unmolested, political
ly speaking, for the past eight years.
The people of both parishes rec
ognize that the incumbents have
had sufficient recognition and that
if for no other reason it is time to
give some other aspirants a chance
to hold office. Consequently the
voters of St. Landry and Evange
line are lining up unsolicited be
hind the candidacies of Sandoz and
Lewis and their election on Septem

a comfortable majority.
JUDGE DUPRE RENDERS AN AC
COUNT O IHIS STEWARDSHIP
Opelousas, La., July 7, 1916.
ro the people of the parish of St.
Landry:
I promised you if I went to the
Legislature to look after your in
terests the best I knew how and I
believe I have done so. I fought
salary raisers from start to finish.
All 0f tdem looked alike to tme.
Whether it bad reference to :
iastice old the ! preaa4iart, ra
same to me. My remedy for these
underpaid officials is their resigna
tion. This is never forthcoming.
The Legislature only succeeded in
raising two salaries. That of Mr.
Wilson,. Commissioner of Agricul
ture, and that of the Judges of the
Civil District Court.
I fought the first. measure bitterly
and it received only sixty votes.
Had the backing of the Committee
of Agriculture and was sent to final
passage with one 'hundred and
twelve members present. Had there
been (as is usually the case) from
ten to twenty absentees, he would
have lost out.
The administration bill for a 3-4
of a mill tax was up for passage
that day and Mr. Wilson's sup
porters taking advantage of this,
put him through first. He is not
going to outlive this.
The Judges, in New Orleans won
out by reason of the twenty-four
votes from that city, their allies,
and a number of country voters
who content themselves with say
ing: "This is a New Orleans meas
ure, it does not affect us." Giving
away the taxpayers money is as
wrong in New Orleans as in St.
Landry, but the people will not
look at it in that light.
Ve killed the bill to pension Dis
trict and Circuit Judges. Put to
flight the measure to increase the
salary of Circuit judges, and had the
Supreme Court bill "returned to
the calendar" for a two years re
pose.
This measure bobs up biennially,
but they can't put it through the
House. I voted against the Primary
Law, the Election law, the Regis
tration law. I voted against the
Board of Affairs measure, which
means increased taxation. I shall
have muoh to say about this meas
ure later on. I voted to place the
sheriff, and assessor on a salary bas
is. I voted against, placing the clerk
in the same class. These measures
may assist the taxpayers, altho I
doubt it very much.
The way to save money, is to re
duce the Tax Collector's fee for col
lecting taxes. No sheriff has been
badly hurt. No Clerk is complaini
ing. Had the cut in their salary
been deep, even I, wit'h my deaf-.
ness. would have heard them bel
lowing in Baton Rouge. Their sat
isfaction leads me to conclude they
have been amply provided for, as
the taxpayers will later on ascer.
tan..
Besides fighting salary- raisers. I
introduced a number of bills. all
of which save two, were 'enacted
into laws. In my next communica
~tion I shall briefly advert to them.
Opposing salary raisers is not
popular in Baton Rouge. Fighting
jadminlatration measures is consid

Edward O. Rightor, a Louisianian
has been honored by the national
convention of the Elks of the
United States, by being elected
grand exalted ruler over Lloyd H.
GMaxwell, of Chicago, by a vote of
983 to 388. Mr. Rightor is the sec
ond Louisiana man to enjoy this
distinction, John P. Sullivan, of
New Orleans, having been elected
to this honorary position a few
years back.
Mr. Rightor is known throughout 1
Louisiana as a successful lawyer
and prominent public man. In 1912 I
he managed the eadpaign of John

comes from a family of jurists, his
father, the late Judge Nicholas H.

"The board is meeting for the last

I was frequently overworked. I

'All of these overworked officials in
Louisiana who considered them
