Potomac River Has
No Man Eaters
Commandant Glennan, of Navy
Yard, Gives Assuring
Information.
There la no sharks In the Potomac
near Washington, nor aro there likely
to be.
Such Is th statement of naval officers
who have had long experience In these
waters. Capt. J. H. Glennan, com
mandant of the Navy Yard today ex
ploded the Idea that sharks might come
up the Potomao as far as Washington.
"They come up beyond York Spit very
seldom. I don't ever remember having
seen' one above there. I can say almost
fiosltlvely that there aro no man-eaters
n the bay."
"A man-eater la a shark that can't
make a living any other way," was Cap
tain Olennan's definition of this preda
tory variety of shark. He told of how
swimming with tho sharks all around
sailors at- Oautanamo Bay went In
but these never bother them. They were
mud sharks, which were peaceable and
Umld in disposition.

FLEES TO SEA

FOUR MORE STILL IN CREEK
Man-Eater Goes Through Bar
rier in Creek Like a Torpedo
and Escapes.
MATAWAN. N. J., July 15.
Bucking the line like a football
halfback, a giant shark plunged
through the chicken wire net that
penned it in Matawan creek, and
escaped to the ocean last night.
The fish, believed to be the same
one that killed a man and a boy in
a savage raid in the creek Wed
nesday, eluded thousands of per
sons who made up a shark posse
and who lined the banks ready to
club or hack it to death.
The chicken wire net was
stretched across the narrow Mata-
wan creek at Keyport, where the
creek empties into Raritan bay.
NOT STRONG ENOUGH.
Fishermen thought it stout enough to
repel the most powerful lunges of the
man-eater. They were wrong. Just be
fore the moon was eclipsed the shark
made his "Hash for Uberty.
No armor-plerclns shell ever shot
through an obatacle with greater
velocity than the shark drove his sharp
snout through the net.
Reports from Perth Amboy were to the
effect that a second shark passed there
earlier In the evening. It Is believed
that the escaped shark Joined his mate
and that the terrible pair are now cruis
ing near some part of the Jersey shore.
Scott Hopkins, a Keyport fisherman,
saw the shark make his escape.
Watchers say there are still at least
four sharks bottled up In the creek. All
night they were sought for with dyna
mite, shotguns and spears by determined
shark hunters, who want to avenge W.
Stanley Fisher and Lester Stlllwell, the
most recent victims.
Shark experts say it la probable that
the shark will seek to return to
Matawan creek In search of more prey.
The funoruls of Stlllwell and Fisher
will bo held here this afternoon.
Patrol of Matawan creek whs resumed
early today by several men carrying
long pike. It was not expected, how
thnt further dynamiting would be done,
and today's task may be one of "watch
ful watting."
Gives Up Hunt.
Capt Edward Craven, ngen ex-sea
cat tain, who has beer, one of tho lend
ers of the shark-hunt, gave up com
pletely today.
Acting Mayor Henderson has offered a
reward of J100 for the capture of the
shark, and o pro-rata reward should
more than one of the man-eaters be
killed. A movement Is on foot to per
suade Governor Flelr to offer i re
ward on behalf of the State. In the

Franz Josef Dying,
Says Zurich Report
Members of Austrian Imperial
Family Summoned to His
Bedside.
ZURICH (via Paris), July IB. The
Austrian Imperial family has been
summoned to Schoenbrunn because
of the Illness of the Emperor Frans
Josef, .according to news dispatches
from Innbruclt, Several specialists are
attending the aged King-Kmperor,
and the news of the war is being with
held from him.
Numerous reports have been receiv
ed concerning the IllneBs of the Aus
trian Monarch. A dispatch from Lon
don on June 17, said "The People," a
London publication, printed an Inter
view with a reliable neutral who had
recently returnod from Vienna, and
who expressed the firm conviction that
the Emperor was dead.
The neutral said that during demon
strations In Vienna the Emperor, In
stead of stepping out on the balcony
of the palace, was lifted up In a chair.
Although ho was exposed to the view'
of the people for some time he made
no motion. In the opinion of "The
People's" Informant the Emperor was
dead, and his embalmed body was
being used to quiet the people of the
capital by the pro-German element,
lest his death should cause a peace
movement In Austria.
Four great tragedies have marked
the reign of Franz Josef, The last of
these, the assassination of his nephew
and heir, the Archduke Francis Fer
dinand, at Sarajevo, on June 28, 1814,
led to the great war.
M'LEAN CASE
Restrains Franois T. Homer
From Delivering' Personal
Letters to Executors.
WILL KEEP NOTES PRIVATE
July 21 Is Date Set for Balti
more Attorney to Answer
Rule in District Court.
Justice Gould, of the Supreme
Court, on the petition of Edward
B. McLean, today ordered Francis
T. Homer, of Baltimore, to show
cause why he should not turn over
to the petitioner all letters of a
personal and private nature now in
his possession which were found
among the effects of the late John
R. McLean. '
This is the beginning of an ef
fort on the part of Mr. McLean to
prevent any of the private and
strictly personal affairs of his
father becoming public property
through legal proceedings that will
result fomr his attempt to upset
the McLean will.
The suit is in the nature of a
friendly action. The petition filed
by Mr. McLean today states that
Mr. Homer has in his possession
a number of letters that do not in
any way pertain to- the property
or any property rights conveyed to
the American Security and Trust
Company, as executor of the es
tate under the will.
WAS TO DESTROY LETTERS.
The petitioner further states that his
father requested him and Mr. Homer
to destroy these letters Immediately on
his death, and It was never his Inten
tion that the letters should pass Into
possession of the executors.
The petition was presented to Judge
Oould who Immediately signed an
order restraining Mr. Homer from de
livering the letters to the executors
and requiring him to show cause on
July 21 why tho order should not be
permanent.
When asked for further details con
cerning his application for a restraining
order today, Mr. McLean said:
"The correspondence referred to
should .not. In my opinion, be brought
Into any legal action, nor will It be
If there Is any way by which I can
prevent It. This part of my father's
correspondence Is altogether of a per
so"l nnture.
"My attorneys have advised me, how
ever, that such of these letters as havo
a bearing on the legal points In contro
versy are of far greater value to my
side of the case than they could pos
sibly be to that of the trust company."
Would Not Use Them.
"Under no circumstances, however,
would I consent to using them to aid
my case, and I shall not permit them to
be Introduced in cvldenco on the other
side, If I can prevent It by any legal
process. I am absolutely determined
that these letters shnll not be exhibited
to the publl;, even to win my lawsuit."

James Hay Named for
Court j)f Claims Will
Retire From Congress
Chairman of House Military Af
fairs Committee to Succeed
Judge Atkinson.
SEEN AS POLITICAL MOVE
Administration Said to Want to
Get Virginia Legislator Out
of Capitol.
Congressman lames Hay. of Virgin
ia, chairman of the House Committee
on Military Affairs, was named
today by President Wilson as a
member of the United States Court of
Claims to succeed Judge George W, At
kinson, of West Virginia, who reUres..
Mr. Hay will retire from Congress.
Although the announcement will
come as a surprise to many persons in
Washington, it is understood to mark
the reeult of an effort of several
months to llnd a place for Mr. Hay
and get him out or Congress, where
his policies as chairman of the Mili
tary Affairs Committee have more or
leas clashed with those of the Admin
istration. Another moving factor in the situa
tion is the fact that the Independents
and Republicans of Mr. Hay's home
district have united behind State Sen
ator Paul, an Independent Republican,
In a determined fight to unseat Hay.
While It la Midught likely that the lat
ter might have won out In the long
run. the fight promised to be an ex
ceedingly Expensive one.
Pays $6,000 a Year.
The new position to which the Vir
ginia Congressman is named pays a
alary of $8,000, and has a life tenure.
If he so desires Mr. Hay at the end
of ten yeara can retire on a pension.
His departure from the position on
cnairman or tho House Military Affairs
Committee will mark the close of a
stormy career. Cboten chairman about
five or six years ago by virtue of senior
ity, Mr. Hay has been the storm center
of every controversy that has been
waged In connection with army affairs.
A man of extreme prejudices, he haa
always been a "small army" man and
always a foe of the General Staff
It was because of his bitter opposition
to former Secretary of War Llndley M.
Garrison, and Ills partiality for the na
tional guard as against the regular,
army, that he was able last winter
completely to block the army prepared
ness legislation and force the President
tc withdraw his active support from the
so-called contlnonlul army plan of Mr.
Garrison's. In consequence of this the
latter resigned from the Cabinet.
There Is a suspicion In many quarters
that his final willingness to compromise
with Senator Chair.berlaln, chairman of
the Senate Military Affairs Committee,
and other big army men of the Senate
was due to his determination to retire
from Congress. Mr. Hay's original
army plan practically allowed no In
crease whatever In the regular army es
tablishment and p reposed to spend all
the money on the mllltla.
Foe of General Wood.
Ho was ait Inveterate foe of Major
Gen. Leonard Wood when the latter was
chief of staff of the army, and in the
zamous Atnsmun-wood row, represent
ing the fight In the War Department be-1
tween the bureau ch'.yfs and the general
staff. Mr. Hoy took sides with Adjutant!

hua tSate.
EL PASO, Tex., July K (Jen. Jacinto
D. Trevino loomed up today, as the
strongest" military leader In Chihuahua
state. He refused to obey orders of
First Chief Carrama to make certain
arrests and of War Minister Obregon to

With 20,000 troops, loyal to Trevino,

Americans Say That Berlin Is
Worried Over Probability of
Ally Suing for Peace.
CAIRO, July 15-Tne famous
city of Mecca, the most holy
place of the Mohammedan
world, has surrendered to the
Arabian rebels, according to dis
patches received here today. The
Turkish garrison of 100 officers
and 2,500 men and 150 civil of
ficials laid down their arms.
ROME, July 15. Germans are worry
ing now over the possibility that Tur
key may desert the Central Powers,
while they are under attack on all' sides
and sue for peace, according to Now
York salesmen who irived here today
from Berlin.'
The two New Yorkers did not pro
fess to have any Information from Ucr
man official sources, but detailed the
discussion heard In German restaurants
and gathering places. They asked that
their nameb be withheld because they
have business interests Fn uermany.
Heveral Americans who desire to go to
Turkey on business, have been dotaincd
In Herlin for three weeks, whlio their
credentials are closelv scrutinized, the
two Americans said. They reported that
the Balkan express was devoted almost
exclusively to carrying military, and
that all civilians who asked permission
to go to Turkey Were viewed with sus
picion. More Drastic Rules.
The German authorities have imposed
more drastic regulations to curb spies,
they said. On entering Germany they
were forced to strip and submit to an
examination with l-.mon Juice to provo
that messages were not written on their
skin In Invisible Ink.
The popular belief In Berlin Is that the
spy regulations have something to do
with preparations' for another big naval
battle, possibly late In July or August.
Tho New Yorkers said that tho "man
In the street" with whom they talked In
Berlin hits come to realize that Germany
can achieve no final vlctrry, and will be
ftatlstled with a peace that brings a
draw.
There Is much dlosatlsfactlon over tho
food situation. ll.-y said, tho chief com
plaint being the rich are suffering less
from the fon.l shortage than the poorer
cluss. In the evening wealthy Berlin
er.i crowd the llrst-clas:, hotels for
substantial meal.
Dinner In the average Berlin hotel
costs about $2. and breakfast and lunch
con about $1.25, -the Americans said,
but some of the articles on the menu
card run very high. Hveri in moderato
priced hotels a peach, for Instunce,
costs S5 cents, thoy reported.
Urge Use of Fish.
Though tho fields are full of cattle
tho authorities aro urging that fish bo
eaten tn order to preserve the meat
supply against the possibility of a long
war.
Potatoes and vegetables, they said,
are being planted n every vacant spot,
even In the public parks and along tho
railroad tracks.
There has been no diminution of the
anti-American feeling, thoy reported.
Even employes of th hotel, at which
they wero stopping constantly said that
Germany would ha won the war
months ago bad It not been for Amer
ican munitions.
The Americans said that ono pence
demonstration occurred at Karlsruho
while they were In Berlin.

BERLIN, July 15. "Despite
severe lopes, the British suc
ceeded in penetrating our lines
between Poziercs and Longuev
val, gaining ground and occupy
ing the Trones wood," Baid an
Official statement issued this
afternoon.
LONDQNJ July 14. The
Germans at one point have been
forced back to the third line of
their defense under smashing
British blows, four miles behind
their original front, General Haig
reported to the war office this
afternoon.
Paris dispatches reported the
Germans have retired on the
French front, adjoining the British,
to the Guillemont-AIbert-Combles
railway. Retreat was made neces
sary by the British advance.
"We have pushed our rear
from Frjcourtto Mametz, captur
ing "2,000 prisoners in twenty
four hours.
"The total number of prison
ers since the beginning of our
offensive is now 10,000.
LINE IS STRAIGHTENED.
The strategic Importance of the
British successes Is marked by the
straightening of thlrllnoln conform
ity with that of the French, who had
hitherto advanced at a much greater
speed than their allies. Tho statements
of press correspondents at the front
that tho British losses were compara
tively small, and the brief preliminary
artillery preparation for tho attack, give
strong support to statements that the
German second lino was much less
rtrongly fortified than their first de
fenses. Fierce counter attacks made by tho
German, In an effort to reconquer
rome of the ground captured by tho
British In today's drive, were complete
ly crushed by the British fire.
Tho reference to the advanco made
by tho rear from Fricourt to Mametz
emphasized the gains made by tho
British in tho fighting yesterday. Tho
first and second British lines appar
ently have advanced well beyond
Mametx with the third running through
the woods where desperate fighting oc
curred. German Attacks Slow Up.
No important now gains slnco the
Issuance of last night's official state
ment were claimed, nor wero they ex
pected. Unofficial dispatches from tho
front had reported that heavy German
counter-attacks lind slowed up the mo
mentum of the new advance, though
the British wero maintaining tllo posi
tions captured yesterday.
The British encountorcd most stub
