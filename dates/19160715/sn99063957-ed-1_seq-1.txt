Results of First Fortnight's Fighting
Anglo-French troops have captured 25 villages
and reconquered sixty square miles of French ter
ritory. More than 00,000 German prisoners have been
taken. 'v.
German losses are estimated at from 60,000 to
75,000 by allied critics. German critics say allied
losses are "frightful."
British troops have penetrated to the German
third line at one point and are less than seven,
miles from Bapaume, their immediate" objective.
French troops have broken through German
second line trenches and are within one mile of
Peronne, their immediate objective. The greatest
British advance is four miles.
The greatest French advance is nearly six miles.
London, July 15. The Germans at one point have
been forced back to the third line of their defense under
smashing British blows four miles behind their original
front, General Haig reported to the war office this
afternoon.. ' , ,- : , . . " -7
"Alt is well at the iBritish front," said an official, state
ment. "We have pushed our rear from : Fricourt to
Mametz, capturing two thousand prisoners in 24 hours.
The total number of prisoners since the beginning of our
offensive is now 10,000. In addition, we have taken large
quantities of material."
The reference to the advance made by the rear from
Fricourt to Mametz emphasized the gains made by the
British in the fighting yesterday. The first and second
British lines apparently have advanced well beyond
Mametz with the third running through the wood where
desperate fighting occurred.
No important new gains since the issuance of last
night's official statement were claimed nor they were
expected. '
Heavy German counter attacks slow
ed up the momentum of the new Bri
tish advance in desperate fighting on
the Ovillers-I.ongeval front last night.
The British encountered most stub
born resistance after breaking through
the German second lino and were met
by steady machine gun fire in the dis
trict north Of Longueval. Notwithstand
ing this determined opposition, the Bri
tish troops continued to consolidate
llieir positions and brenk down small
German positions in fighting that con
tinued wel Unto the night.
The newly conquered positions, in
gome caBes on the slopes of rolling hills
whose ridges are held by the Germans,
re being made ready for defense

The Germans poured a hot artillery
fire upon the southern fringe of the
village of Ovillers throughout yester
day's fighting, after most of the town

itself had fallen into British hands.
Correspondents at the British front re
ported that hundreds of bodies lie buried
beneath the ruins of the town.
"The fighting for Ovillcrs has been
hard, bloody and close," said one dis
patch. "Many of our men died to gain
a yard or two of the earthworks. There
have been fights to tho death between
a handful of English or Irish soldiers
I and a dozen or more Germnns, meeting
jench other in the darkness of deep eel
liars quarried out from the chalk sub-
soil.
"Ovillcrs is a place of abominable
i ruin. There is not a wall standing two
i feet high or a bit of a wall. The guns
I have swept it flat, but underground
I there are still great cellars quarried out
by the inhabitants and these the Ger
mans are holding out against our at
tacks and bombardments.
I "Heavy shells have opened up some
of them and filled them with dead and
wounded. The ground is pitted with en
ormous shell holes in which the men lie
buried. Ovillers is perhaps more ghnst
lv than anv ruined ground along this
front."
Special dispatches from Taris this af
ternoon reported that the Germans have
retired on the French front, adjoining
the British to the Guillemont-Albert-Comblea
railway. The retreat was made
necessary by the British advance.
Berlin Admits Losses.
Berlin, July 15. "Despite severe
losses the British succeeded in pene

grams Puzzling
Portland, Or., July 15. Detectives
are searching Portland toduy for Dr.
U E. Axford of San Francisco an
optometrist, or for a mysterious Wil
liam Bradford, who is supposed to know
something about Axford 's disappear
ance. ,
A letter just received by the Port
land police from Frank A." Merserenu,
proprietor of the Merserenu apartments,
2205 Mission street, Sun Francisco,
gave the first details. Merserenu de
clared that shortly after the disap
pearance of Dr. Axford, his fiance,
Mrs. A. E. Stone, 82 Bartlett street,
San Francisco, received a telegram
from Portland, signed by a William
Bradford. The message said Dr. Ax
ford was in Portland after having been
rescued from an open boat off the
const, and that he was suffering from
"ill usnge and exposure."
Mrs. Stone answered the message,
according i Mersereau, and received
an answer saving Dr. Axford was do-
I ing well and was receiving good care.
The message said he would return home
in a few days. The messages sent
were found in Portland telegraph of;
fice, but they have no address nor
clue as to tho identity of William
'Bradford.
I The first message led detectives to
believe Dr. Axford might have been

boarded with Mrs. Stone. He has a
son, Haymond Axford, and a 14 year
old daughter died several weeks ago in

Mersereau 's letter, Axford 's relatives
feared his mind was unbalanced as a
result of the death of his daughter.
Several men nnincd William Brad
ford have been questioned, but detec
tives have not found the right man.

Hopeless Wreck
Charleston, S. C, July 15. Survivors
of the wreck, of the naval coilier Hec

stories of the disaster. Captain G. F.
Newell, they said, together with 15 men
of his crew, remained -with his vessel
after the tug Wellington had taken off
102 crew members, and marines. The
16 wore later rescued by 1he lighthouse
tender Cypress.
The Wellington had -to .give up her
rescue work with the captain and others
still on board because of the darkness
and the rough sea. Few of the surviv
ors believed they would again see those
left behind, for the Hector was rapidly
filling through her, hatches.
She was well gone when the Cypress
reached her. i
Lieutenant-Adams, commanding the
50 marines from Port Royal, said the
wind that hit the Hector was blowing
110 miles an hour.
Taken. Off At Daylight ,
Charleston, S. C.f July 13. Wttli the
naval collier Hector-broken m two by'
yesterday's storm aud -abandoned late

The Hector was abandoned at 12:45

cluding G. F. Newell, her master, are
proceeding to Charleston aboard the
rescue vessels.
At 2:!0 yesterday afternoon the
Hector first flashed her distress call,
saying she was 14 miles south of
Charleston, with a list of ten degrees
starboard. Twenty minutes later she
sent another 8. O. S. with the cry " be
lieve we are sinking."
The Bteamer Alamo imniediateify
sped to her assistance and wns follow
ed quickly by the tug Vigilant. Cap
tain Hunt of the lntter vessel report
ed, however, that he was unable to got
within three miles of the Hector and
that static conditions prevented her
from communicating with tlie Alamo
by wireless.
Just after the wireless Telling that
the llecor was sinking the collier

leave. Send help." Anil nothing fnr-
ther was heard until 3:55 when Newell

Ten minutes after the last message,
"Send help at once" was sent, he
Alamo was standing by. Then tho'
wireless failed.
Immediately after the Hector's first
distress cull at Charleston, calls from
the Arlington radio station were heard,
asking any vessel to go to the Hec
tor's assistance.
The Hector had left Port Royal for
Santo Domingo, carrying marine re
cruits for the latter place and Cuba. J
She attempted to put Into port hero

NEARLY ABANDONED
Still Patrolling Creek But
Have Little Hope of Catch
ing Man Eater
Matawan, N. J., July 15. Crowds of
pleasure seekers who would ordinarily
spend their Saturday afternoon at the
beaches, wer.e expected to flock here
today to join in New Jersey's game
of shark hunting, but there was lit
tle hope held out b y seasoned hunters
that the big fish which has killed four
persons within the last fortnight will
now be caught. ,
The funeral of Lester Stillwoll and
Stanley Fisher, the shark's most recent
victims, will be held here this after
noon. At tho same time it is believed
the search for the man eater which at
tacked them, will virtually come to a
halt. -
There have been rumors that a shark
has been seen near Keyport, but for 24
hours there has not been aa authentic
report of the presence of the man killer
in Matawan creek. A railroad engineer
reported sighting the big fish, but this
is doubted. Most of the searchers be
lieve the shark escaped from the creek
soon after killing Stillwell and Fisher.
A patrol of Matawan creek was re
sumed early today by several men
carrying long pikes. It was not ex
pected, however, that further dynamit
ing would be done and today's task
may be one of "watchful waiting."
Captain Edward Craven, aged ex-sea
captain, who has been one of the leaders
in tbe hunt for the shark, gave up com
pletely today. - j
"The creek be damned and the shark
be damned. I think I'll quit," was the
way toe captain sized things up.
Acting Mayor Henderson has offered
a reward of $100 for the capture of the
shark, and a pro-rata reward should
more than one "of the man eaters be
killed. A movement Is on foot to per
suade Governor. Fielder to offer a re
ward on behalf of the state.
In the meantime great interest cen
ters here in tbe steps to be taken by
the government.' It is expected revenue
cutters will soon patrol the Jersey coast.

; Will Please Germans.
By Carl W. Ackerman.
(United Press staff correspondent.) .
Berliu, July IS. Berlin is anxiously
awaiting a decision by. the .-American
state department-on-the status of the
submarine Deutschland.. .
A formal finding that the Deutsch
land is a merchantman, in the face of
protests- of allied diplomats, will go a
long way toward convincing OcrmanB
thatAmerica is really trying to be neu
tral. At the same time it would be a
blow to the Von Tirpitz supporters, who
have been urging a disregard for Amer
ican opinions and the resumption of
former submarine policies. '
Ambassador Gerard has received cer
tain confidential information regarding
the Deutschland but he will not discuas
it in any way.
The American consul at Bremen and
Berlin dculed today that they had been
asked by Washington why they had not
reported the Deutschland 's departure.
Such a report was received hore from
London. They said they knew nothing
of the Deutschland 's departure.

Market Very Tame
Prices Fluctuated Little
New York, July 15. The New York
Evening Sun's financial review today
said:
As is usually the on so in the tsliort
Saturday session of the stock market in
mid-summer, the market today was very
tame as well as highly professional.
Although prices for the most part con
tinued the upward movement of the last
hour of Friday's session, the changes
were narrow and lacked any suggestion
of vigor or disclosed more than the most
perfunctory interest. There was little
in the news developments over night
of market-wise influence, although little
there were numerous items from both
foreign nnd domestic sources, which
tended to impart cheer, notably the
continued success of the allies on all
fronts, peace discussion progress toward
an understanding in our Mexican rela
tions, and so on. United States Steel
and most of the standard industrials
held closely at the closing prices and
there was distinct firmness in the motor
and metal issues. Munitions specialties
were inclined to be somewhat unsettled
but the movements were narrow and the
net results . in the early session was
scarcely changed.
Thero was very little change in the
later trnding which became even quick
er thnn before.

Strict Watch for Spies and

Turkey Suspected
By John H. Hearley.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Borne, July 15. Germans are wor
rying now over the possibility that
Turkey may desert the central power
while they are under attack on all
sides and sue for peace, according to
two New York salcsmon who arrived
here today from Berlin.
I he two New Yorkers did not nrofess
to have any information from German
sources, but detailed the discussion
heard in German restaurants and gath
ering places. They asked that their
names rje wnnneid uecause tbey hava .
business interests in Germany.
nevorai Americans who desired to ro -
to Turkey on business, have been de-.
tamed in Berlin for three weeks.
while their credentials are closely scru
tinized, the two Americans said. Tbey
reported tnat the Balkan express was
devoted almost exclusively to carrying.
military, and that all civilians who
asked permission to go to Turkey wera
viewed with suspicion. 'V .-
inc. Herman authorities hava im
posed more drastic regulations to curb
spies, they said. On entering Germany,
they were forced to strip aud submit
to an examination with lemon, juice to,
prove that messages were not written
on their skin in invisible ink. The pop
ular belief in Berlin is that the spy.
regulations have something to do with
preparations ior anoiner Dig naval Daf
tle, possibly late in July or August.
The New Yorkers snid that the "man
in the street" with whom they talked
in Berlin, has come to realize that Ger
many can achieve no final victory and

brings a draw. There is much dissatis
faction over the food situation, they
said, and the cliie'i complaint being tnat
tho rich are suffering less from the food
snortago than the poorer class. In the
evening wealthy Berliners crowd " the
first class hotels for a substantial meal.
Dinner in the averuge Berlin hotel
costs about (2 and breakfast and lunch
eon about (1.25 the Americans said, but
sums of the articles on the menu card
run very high. Even in moderate priced
hotels a peach, for instanco, costs 35
cents, they reported.
Though the fields are full of cat
tle, tho authorities are urging that fish
be eaten in ordor to preserve tho meat
supply against the possibility of a long
war. Potatoes and vegetables, they said,
are being planted in every vacant spot,
even in the public parks and along ths
ruilroad tracks.
There has been no diminution of th
anti-American feeling, they report.
Even employes of the hotel at which
they aro stopping constantly said that
Germany would have won the war
mouths ago if it had not been for Amer
ican munitions.
The Americans snid that one peace
demonstration occurred at Karlsruhe
while they were in Berlin.
