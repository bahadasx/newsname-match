GOOD WORDS FROM C E. FIANN AMD
A. J. HANCOCK, CF DOWNS, WHO
HAVE KNOWN MR. BENTON
MANY YEARS.
From The Downs News end Times,
18, 1916.
Hon. Otis L. Benton of Oberlin, can
didate for republican nomination for
congress, was in town Monday, getting
acquainted with the voters. Mr. Ben
ton is making a xfcrscnal canvas of this
part of the district and before the time
for the primary, he hopes to meet prac
tically all of the voters. Benton is a
dynamo of energy and his active cam
paign work shows that he would be a
powerful worker in congress. Along
; with this he has a knowledge of the
needs of the district, having grown up
from boyhood in Decatur count, lie
is a man that does things; is a strong,
independent thinker, and if elected to
congress, no parly caucus will ever
bind him to vote for measures that are
inimical to the interests cf the sixth
district. Congressman Connelly, the
present incumbent, bound by a party
caucus, voted for the Underwood tarifl
law, which aimed a blow at practically
every product of his own congressional
district, and showed favoritism to the
products of the south.
Twenty-three years ago "the writer
was employed as ?. printer at Oberiin.
Our'jjhop v.-a? inline basement of the
same building m which Otis Benton
was employed as a bank clerk. We re
member him as a quiet, unassuming
young man who was always on the job.
He worked hard and saved his money.
As fast as he would get a little money
ahead he would invest in land, which
was dirt cheap in those days. A little
later when he could afford it, he began
stocking up these farm
His business
ability was noticed by the business men
of Oberlin of that day, and this writer
once overheard , one of the most prom
inent Democratic politicians of that
town say one day: "Do you know th;...
Otis L. Benton will be heard from one
of these days?" The prophecy is now
coming true, as it now seems certain
that Benton will be nominated and
elected to congress this fall.
Started Out With Benton.
A. J. Hancock of Downs, junior
member of the firm of Trombla &. Han
cock, started on his business career in
the ofnee of Otis L. Benton, at Oberlin,
fourteen j-ears ago. He was engaged
in the work for'several years, and nat
urally came to know Mr. Benton and
his methods thoroughly, In speaking
to a News and Times reporter the other
day, Mr. Hancock said: "I am strong
for Mr. Benton for congress, because I
know the man and his business methods
intimately. He is the most thorough
and conscientious man I ever worked
for, and he was always more than kind
and fair in his dealings with me. If he
is elected to congress I believe he will
be able to do much more for the district
than anyone else who has been men
tioned, for he is a tireless worker and
has a way of accomplishing things that
most men would think impossible. Not
only is he industrious and possessed of
great executive ability, but he is a man
of splendid morals and is on the square
every day in the week. I am recom
mending Benton for congress to ever3'
man I meet." , adv.

A Trip to the Country. j
' The Baldwin Standing Grain Thresher j
is stni demonstrating on tne Lewis j
Kraus farm. Hundreds of people have !
seen the machine work. All express
themselves in terms of approval. The !
representatives of the machine appre- I
ciate the hearty cooperation of the peo- ;
pie who have made it possible to prove :
to the world that a new revolutionary
farm implement has been given to the !
world. Men from various parts of the
state have watched it in operation.
One man by the name of J. M. Jara !
from Chile, South America, witnessed ;
the machine at work and was highly ;
pleased. He wants his country to be- i
come interested. He wants one. He j
said he has 2,000 acres under irrigation j
and grew much wheat. Let us hope j
this combined harvester and thresher j
will soon be on every farm. Then we '
will r. at have to be bothered with these j
; irresponsible I. V7. W.'s Their philoso-
i phv is foolish and their ways of en
forcing their philosophy are terrible
This machine will help to stop this
untrained, poorly advised unaccount
able horde of men.
The writer in company with Rev. A.
S. Hale, President W. A. Lewis, H. II.
Pierce and Curtis C. Baldwin, inventer
of the world wonder the Baldwin
Standing Grain Harvester, drove cut to
Lewis Kraus' ranch on last Monday af
ternoon, southwest of Haj-s eight mile3,
to witness the operation of that now
famous machine. There were some
forty persons present among the num
ber were eight ladies, who seemed to
be as much interested as were the men.
Several plots of the same size were
laid out by Prcf . Kiene, of the Experi
ment Station and a header operated in
the usual manner bv three men and
eight horses including the team wagon
and two men that operated the header
barge, contested for the championship.
The plots were the same in size and as
near as could be judged the same in
amount of grain. After the contest
the header grain was threshed and fell
behind the harvester about five bushels.
The harvester gathers the grain, win
nows the chaf and sacks the wheat
a3 it movesalong. Six horses operate
the machine.
With ths header it takes three men,
eignt ncrses ana a tnresning macnine
and a crew of men to do the sam3
work, therefore yox can readily see
that tne. Baldwin harvester" be
sides saving the grain is also a tim3
saver and a money maker. The trip
was made in Mr. Baldwin's six cylinder
Ha3'nes automobile, driven by Mr.
Baldwin at a speed of forty-five miles
per hour. With the young blood of
this twentieth century age, time and
distance doesn't count for much. The
Baldwin Company have been offered
one and one-half million in cash for
their patents but turned it down. The
patent is not for sale at any price.

The United States Census Statistics
CONTAINS SOME INTERESTING FIGURES
These figures show that sixty-sir, read it, (66) out
of 100 people dying in the United States have ab
solutely no estate. They die penniless.
Of the remaining thirty-four (34) persons, twenty-five
die with less than $1300, and only nine (9)
persons in one hundred (100) have more than $5000
when they die.
The above figures are not estimates, idle guesses
or fiction, they are the facts, arrived at by the U.
S. Government in its Census reports.
The remedy is simple. Just save your money.

Republican Senatorial Candidate
Hat
Many Friends
The candidacy of C. W. Miller, Sr..
for state senator from the Thirty-ninth
Kansas district seems to have crystal
ized among the republicans of the dis
trict into a sentiment that since this
district is very evenly balanced and El
lis county only came over into the re
publican column in 1914 under the lead
ership of Miller, he shall be accorded
the nomination without serious opposi
tion. Miller has been one of the republican
leaders in Western Kansas for years.
He has served a3 committeeman of
practically every republican organiza
tion in Western Kansas from a county
to a congressional district. He came
to Kansas in 1873 as a farm hand at $8.
