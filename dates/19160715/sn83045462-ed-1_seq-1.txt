Officials Believe International

Difficulties.
: TREND OF NEGOTIATIONS
APPROVED BY MR. WILSON
i Gen. Carranza Also Quoted in Favor
of Plan?Agreement Is Con-,

Solution of difficulties between
the United States and Mexico
appeared today to trend more and
more toward settlement through
an international joint commission.
Informal conferences between
Acting Secretary of State Polk
and Eliseo Arredondo, Mexican
ambassador designate, it was indicated.
were developing ques
tions for probable submission to
such a body.
Gen. Carranza Is said to approve the
commission plan of settling- differences
as provided in the treaty of 1S48, and
State Department officials are believed
to be willing to let negotiations take
this course, though preferring that adjustment
be made through the present
conferences. President Wilson, it is
understood, is not dissatisfied with the
direction negotiations are taking.
Confident of Agreement.
Both Mr. Polk and the ambassador
are confident that an agreement will
be reached in the near future. It is not
known whether the powers of the negotiators
finally decided upon will include
authority to fix the time and condition
under which American troops
will be withdrawn.
Mr. Arredondo has issued a statement
warning against sensational stories
published throughout this country by
those \\ ho desire intervention.
*'I beg to warn the American people,"
he said, "against the falsity of reports
published within the last few days.

Provision for Extending Benefit

In etriking out of the District appr<
prlation bill the House language cove
lng the Borland amendment relating
the paving of streets, the Senate a;
propriations committee has permits
the existing law, the original "Borlar
amendment." to stand. In the Hou;
this session an attempt was made
amplify and extend the principle
compelling owners of abutting proper
to pay half the cost of paving or r
paving Btreets. Had the House lai
guage been retained it would have h?
the effect of extending the principle i
: an to cover suburban streets which a
'improved with macadam "or other for
i of pavement."
Meets With Protest.
! Strong protest against such acll<
i was made by many residents of tl
District to the Senate committee, ai
the committeemen became convince
that the proposed amendment to tl
I present law would be an injustice.
; "The thing is overdone under existir

men today, "and it has come to such
i pass that a man of moderate means a
hardly afford to own property in tl

in the street and the property owne
must foot the bill."

NEW YORK. July 15.?Hotel and

? local health authorities acted under
instructions from Dr. Hermann M.

who was iea 10 sena out a. new *,n vu?ai
of information owing to the fact that

Health Officials Believe
Washington Will Escape
Epidemic On in New York
?e
g Washington is waging as Intelligent a
h campaign of preparedness against inva,r
sion by Infantile paralysis as any city ir
jn the country.
This was the statement today of Dr
j_ William C. Fowler, head of the contagious
disease service of the health department,
f_ following his return from New York
s- where he attended a conference of healtli
experts on methods for preventing spread
of the disease.
Ie Suggestions contained in the Commis?r
sioners* proclamation for minimizing the
a" danger of the appearance of the malad>
here are as effective as any that can 6e
proposed at the present time, in the opinion
of Dr. Fowler, who also considers the
jjioii 14.1. o uuauuis j/oi a.i j oid icguiauum
sufficient.
jn While a second case of the disease
I was reported to the health department
J yesterday, the diagnosis was so obscure
that officials are doubtful whether
the child was infected or injured b>
a fall. The infant has practically re11
covered, but shows bruises to sustair
the accident theory.
Health officials are growing more optimistic
daily over the prospect ol
Washington escaping an epidemic ol
the scourge. Reports indicate thai
citizens generally are complying wltli
the suggestion made by the Commiso
sioners, and it is believed that the capr_
pital not only will not be visited by infantile
paralysis, but will establish a
? remarkable health record for the resl
P- of the year on account of the thorough
,d cleaning it is receiving.

The infantry, which went into action w
shortly before dawn, anticipated a most
i determined resistance and expected to

1 appears that there is only one point in
these German trenches where the ma'
chine guns have, not been put out of
j, action and demolished completely. fl
Germans Fight Stubbornly. ^
For a space of 200 yards the British fl<
swept past a section of the trench hi

A8 a spectacle to an eyewitness, this
:tion of the second big stage of the
Jttle of the Somme surpassed that of
Jly 1. Taking needed ground for oranizing
new trenches and throwing
it small parties, who dug themselves
i, the army has been gradually gainig
a position from Oviilers, La Bois;lle
and Montauban, a distance of
>ur miles, from which to deliver a
low, and until many points were
ithin 200 yards of the German second
ne. Meanwhile, the shells of the
ritish artillery could be seen cutting
?e wire and making thorough prepaitions,
of which Gen. Sir Dcuglas
aig, the British commander, insists
lere is evidence on every hand.
"Tomorrow morning at three,*' came
le laconic word yesterday evening, "presded
by the usual intensive preliminary
ambardment, only a little hotter."
Good View of Battle.
The ground gained by.the British on
uly 1 and in subsequent operations gave
le Associated Press observer a viewDint
from which the whole line of attack
>uld be seen. The faint moonlight enaled
the gunners dimly to see their work,
le inrantry ana tne contour of the
round. "This is a real daylight-saving
low." said one of the gunners.
Seemingly, as the observer pushed auicipusly
close to the German line, there
as the greatest concentration of guns
' all calibers probably ever made in a
Iven area. From behind the German
enches gained July 1 darted the dagger
ishes through a blanket of night. One!
vo! three! four! For battery after bat:ry
was shooting at high speed, from the
Dttom of the hillside to the top. The
:ene of artillery power was no less insscribable
than the thrilling suggestion
f the waiting infantry battalion lines
fcich were seen going into position before
?e battle.

Directed by Rockets.
In the direction of Longueval. a big
re was seen. It was the village or a
:orehouse burning, as the bright spot
as growing to a steady point In the
eld of gun flashes. Then, soaring
Bavenward, went a rocket signal light
hich gave the positions gained in the
ttack. Commanders in the rear angered
with other signals, while what
id been the German strongholds half
i hour or an hour before were burnig
red patches, spread with sparks of
nmnn candles. This method of com
lunication is a difficult part of the
iislncss of directing an army under
>ver of darkness.
At the first flush of dawn the first
ritish aeroplane came humming from
s aerodrome toward the German lines,
id the sausage-shaped observation bal10ns
arose together into the air in a
ague scene of oblong and grotesque
lonitors.
Out of the blanket of which the guns

ark masses became Mametz ana other

war office announced today.
The British also have occupied
Trones wood. The
fighting is continuing.
LONDON, July 15.?British
guns and British infantry continue
to deepen the big dent in
the German lines north of the
Somme.
After forcing the second line
along a four-mile front, Gen. Sir
Douglas Haig's forces continued
the attack today. As a result the
Germans at one point have been
pushed back to their third line of
defense. This marks a British advance
of four miles from the
original German lines as. they existed
at the beginning of the offensive
on July 1 in the FricourtMametz
sector.
More Than 10,000 Prisoners.
The force of the renewed British drive
is shown not only in the ground gained,
but in the number of prisoners captured.
The war office reports the taking of more
than 2,000 Germans within the past
twenty-four hours, the total since the
start of the offensive now being in excess
of 10,000.
While the British are thus pushing back
the Teutonic lines the French on their
right flank are remaining comparatively
inactive, having already achieved a similar
object. They are busy at Verdun,
however, wnere they have repulsed an attack
near the Avocourt redoubt, on the
extreme left of the Verdun front, while
their artillery is actively replying to bombardments
by the crown prince's guns on
the east bank of the Meuse. *
At Apremont attempted German attacks
were broken up by the French barrage
flre.

troops in bombarding formidable enemy
positions and in making other necessary
preparations for a further advance.
"This morning, after an intense bombardment,
the assault was launched at
3:25 a.m. The enemy was driven from
his trenches on the whole froMlt of attack,
and many prisoners fellLinto our
hands.
"Fierce fighting continued all day, as
a result of which we have steadily increased
our gains and now are in possession
of the enemy's second position
from Bazantin-le-Petit to Longueval,
both villages inclusive, and the whole
of the Trones wood.
"In the Trones wood we released a
party of the Royal West Kent Regiment
who, separated from our own troops in
the recent fighting, and surrounded by
Germans, had held out in the northern
M*d of the wooa ior iorty-eignt hours.
"Two determined counter attacks on
our new positions werei;j^mpletely
crushed by our fire. Latere the day,
a.fter a fierce counter attack* the Germans
succeeded in recapturing: the village
of Bazentin-le-Petit, but were at
>nce driven out again by our infantry,
rhe whole villege is once more in our
