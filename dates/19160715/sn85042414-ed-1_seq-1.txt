district court at Cleveland, received

UNIFORM CLASSES DEMANDED.'
Chicago, July 16.—Witnesses before
the interstate commerce commislon
In its investigation of lumber lists
and tariffs here were almost unani
mous in demanding uniform classifi
cation of the transportation rates on
lumber. This classification is desired

and consuming centers, it having been
testified to that it would be exceed
ingly impracticable to detremine geo
graphically the boundaries of "con
suming centers."
NOTE EXPLAINS
POUCYCHANGE
Reason Given for Abandon
ment of Declaration of
London.
London, July 15.—The British for
eign office addressed a note to neutral
governments explaining the reasons
which prompted the' abandonment of
the declaration' of London.
The declaration was abrogated by an
order in council published on July 8
and a similar decree was Issued in
Paris on the same day.
The present British note explains
that the entente allies adopted' the
declaration of London at the begin
ning of the war because, in their
anxiety to conform to International
law, they believed the declaration
provided a suitable digest of princi
ples and a compendium of working
rules.
"These rules," says the note, "did
not necessarily possess the force of
law, but seemed in main lines to pre
sent a statement of rights and duties
of belligerents based on experience
In previous naval wars. But, as'the
struggle proceeded it developed be
yond all previous concessions owing
to the manifold scientific improve
ments In warfare and produced condi
tions altogether different to previous
naval wars. It then became dear
that the attempt made in times of
peace, by the declaration of London,
to determine the principles of law
and their application, failed to pro
duce a satisfactory result.
"The allied governments, forced to
recognise the situation thus created,
therefore, decided they must confine
themselves simply to applying the his
toric and admitted rules of the laws
of nations."

FRENCH TRI-COLOR
WORN IN LONDON
London, July 15.—Appropriately on
the day of the French national fete
when every Londoner wore in his but
tonhole a tri-color ribbon in honor of
his allies, came the stirring news of
the successful British attack on the
German second line wh|»!h opened
before dawn and carried a number
of new positions.
The Associated Press correspond
ent at the front describes the attacks
as surpassing that of July 1, as a
great spectacle and a thrilling dis
play of artillery power. Characteristic
of the fighting throughout the battle
of the Somme the Germans appeared
to be unable to bring up sufficient re
serves to make successful counter at
tacks. A second point, which is em
phasised by observers on the allied
side, is that in fighting at close quar
ters the Germans surrender freely.

Rome, July 16.—The Berlin bank

The German foreign office has offi

CASE WILL NOT
BE PRECEDENT
Effort Made to Prevent the
News Reaching Allied
Warships.
Washington, July 16.—The state
department formally ruled today t^at
German .submarine Deutsohland is a
merchant vessel land Is entitled to
treatment as such.
In announcing this ruling acting
secretary Polk said' It was not to be
taken as a precedent and any similar
case arising in the future would be
dealt with on its own merits.
"In view of the facts of this par
ticular case" said Secretary Polk,
'there is no reason why the- Deutsch
land should be considered a war
vessel."
Baaed on Report
The department's action was based
upon the reports of the navy and cus
toms officers* who examined the sub
marine at Baltimore, and found it
was unarmed, and incapbale of be
ing converted for warlike purposes
without extensive changes.
The advisory report of the neutral

British Front in France, July 1C,
(via London)—Even the plegmatic
British generals and staff officers are
showing elation over the results this
morning of the night attack against
the German second line, although
careful to state that the great task
against a powerful foe is only bare
ly started. 8oon after daylight the
joyful news of the British success
slipped into a telephone message over
the area occupied by the British army.
Mighty Spectacle.
As a spectacle to an eye witness,
this action of the second big stage of
the battle of the Somme surpassed
that of July 1. Taking needed
ground for organizing new trenches
and throwing out small parties, who
dug themselves in, the army has been
gradually gaining a position from
Ovlllers, La Boisselle and Montauban,
a distance of four miles, from which
to deliver a blow and until many
points were within 200 yards of the
German second line. Meanwhile the
shells of the British artillery could be
seen cutting the wire and making
thorough preparations, of which Gen
eral Sir Douglas Halg, the British
commander, insists there is evidence
on every hand.
'"Tomorrow morning at 3," came
the laconic word yesterday evening,
"preceded by the usual intensive pre
liminary bombardment, only a little
hotter."
The ground gained by the British
on July 1 and in subsequent opera
tions gave the Associated Press ob
server a viewpoint from which the
whole line of attack could be seen.
The faint moonlight enabled the gun
ners dimly to bee their work, the In
fantry and the contour of the
ground.

"This is a real daylight-saving

Artillery Begins.
Seemingly as the observer pushed
audaciously close to the German line,
there was the greatest concentration
of .guns of all calibres probably ever
made In a given area. From behind
the Gentian trenches gained on July
1, darted the dagger flashes through
a blanket of night. One! Two! Three!
Four! For battery after battery was
shooting at high speed, from the bot
tom of the hillside to the top. The
scene of artillery power was no less
Indescribable than the thrilling sug
gestion of the waiting infantry bat
talion lines which were seen going in
to position before the battle. At the
moment the assault started it seem
ed there was no interval In the
thunders as the guns moved forward
their curtain of shell-bursts In front
of the first wave of Infantry advancing
across the zone between their trench
es and the German lines.
Strongholds Burn.
In the direction of Longueval, a big
fire was seen. It was the village or a
storehouse burning, as the bright spot
was growing to a steady point in the
field of gun flashes. Then, soaring
heavenward, went a rocket signal
light which gave the positions gained
in the attack. Commanders In the
rear answered with ether signals,
while what had been the German
strongholds half an hoar or so before
were burning red patches, spread with
the sparks of Roman candles. This
method of communication is a difficult
part of the business of directing an
army under cover of darkness.

from its aerodrome toward the Ger
man-lines, and the sausage-shaped ob
servation balloons arose together Into
the air in a vague scene of oblong and
grotesque monitors. Out of the
blanket where the guns were flashing
sroee the white slashes of the man of
old German trenches, the ribbons
were roads and finally, the dark
masses became Mametz and other now
famous woods, and the gaunt finger
points the trunks of trees, which had
shaded the highways, but now were
denuded of limbs by the shell fire.
While the smoke barages from the
British lines were carried by favor
able winds and the shells made other
points of the line indistinct, the ridge
of Longueval, where the British bur
rowed forward against commanding
positions and a stubborn, cunning and
brave foe, was seen distinctly to be
in their possession. More lines of
troops were moving through the Ger
man curtains of shell fire to the sup
port of those who had gained the hot
ly desired summit, and now were look
ing down hill where the German guns
are hidden and with the Bapaume
ridge In the distance. Behind them
all was the organization which had
plotted the action of the army, and
back of those were battalions await
ing their orders.
A sergeant of artillery of the typi
cal ruddy-faced "John Bull" type, sit
ting stiff on his horse after a sleep
less night directing the columns of
caissons, hurrying up ammunition on
the greedy guns, called out:
"Mind your wheel horse! Now all
together like I taught you to do."
The wheels with their padded and
noiseless axles went up the embank
ment with every rider urging his
straining mount.
