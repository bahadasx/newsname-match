-Much of the trade lost by small
town merchants to foreign con
petition is the direct result of a
lack of proper advertising.
A most convincing example in
substantlation of this stateimnt
came under my observa:ion about
thaee years ago during a visit to
one of our small towns.
While interviewing one of the
merchants in the ineterest of stan
dard mercahandise and better sel
ling methods, a woman called to
get a button replaced on a shoe
which service, by the way, was
gladly performed without charge.
After examining it this merchant
asked where it had been bought.
"In blank City," replied the lady.
"I buy all my shoes there."
"Why don't you buy your shoes
here? "he countered. "I can save
you the expense and inconvenience
of sending away for them."
"I would like to," she rejoined
but I wear this make of shoe only,
in this particular style or last."
He immediately turned to his

"I handle this full line during
the entire year''", he explained.
'And anm. therefore, in position to
serve you to much better advantage
than any one at a distance."
She promptly informed him that
he would get all of her future
shoe patronage. In fact' she
would call a friend's attention to
the fact that this line was carried
locally and insisted on her calling
and inspecting his stock.
Her only reason for not having
patronized him in the past was she
did not know that she could ob
tain the particular shoe she want
ed from his store.
After she had departed he ex
plained that the reason he had not
advertized the shoe in his local
paper was that he presumed every
body in the community would,
sooner or later, call and look over
his stock.
Then' too, he had been in the
shoe business for a long time and
naturally figured that the trade
was familiar with his merchandise.
Same old story: An utter lack of
appreciation of the value of adver.
tising -acquainting possible pur
chasers with what he had to offer
them.
The public would, of course,
eventually become familiar with
his lines in some way or oter. He
could, however, obtain desired re
sults in this direction much more
economically and expeditiously by
utilizing the various forms of ad.
vertising media at his command,
particularly his local newspaper.

SWEPT BY HURRICANE
Southwestern Louisiana, Mississippi,
Alabama and Western Florida
Included.
New Orleans, La.-More than $4,
000,000 damage was done in Missis
sippi and Alabama by the tropical
storm of last Wednesday and Thurs
day. according to estimates made this
we, k from reports received from the
storm area anid figures given by per
sons connected with the various indus
tries affected.
This total includes estimated dam
age to buildings and other prorerty in
cities and country districts. growing
crops, timber, shipping, railroads and
telegraph and telephone wires.
The aggregate estimated damage, it
is believed, will be increased when
more detailed information is obtain
able and when fuller reports are re
ceived from Pensacbla and the West
Florida coast.
Compilation of reports from various
points in Southern Mississippi indi
cated damage in that section to corn,
cotton and other crops was about $1.
500,000. In Northern and Central Mis
sissippi, the loss was placed at about
$3it0.000; .Mississippi coast cities and
vicinity, including small craft damage,
about $300,000: Mobile and vicinity,
about $250,000; lumber interests in
Mississippi and Alabama, about $1,
000,000; telephone and telegraph com
panies, about $300,000; railroads,.
about $200,000.
Twelve persons are known to have
been killed and at least forty are re
ported missing as a result of last Wed
nesday's tropical hurricane on the east
gulf coast and a series of storms, tor
nadoes and floods that followed in the
interior of Alabama and Georgia.
In addition. unconfirmed reports say
that nearly a score of other persons
were killed in isolated villages near
Mobile. Several days will be required
to determine the correctness of these
reports, owing to prostrated wire and
rail communication throughout ttl
storm-swept region. Property damage
probably will reach $56,000,000, crops
and timber suffering seriously.
The dead: Farmer killed near Cairo,
Ga., when his home was demolished
by tornado; white engineer and white
fireman klted Friday at Bond, Miss.,
in wreck due to washout; three no
groes drowned in flood near Birming
ham; two negroes drowned in gale on
Warrior river, near Tuscaloosa; negro
drowned in flood at Hawkilusvlle, Ga.;
white man and woman and negro kill

Reports from planters in this and
adjoining parishes show that there is
an increase of 10 per cent in cotton
acreage over the area planted last
season. The increase is not confined
to any particular locality nor evenly
distributed between hill and river
lands, but is uniform in both cases,
planters in general apparently having
extended their acreage in anticipation
of increased demand for staple next
fall,
The same can not be said of the
stand. In the same localities it will
be good in one field and mediocre or
worse In the one adjoining and
throughout the section is skippy or

a late season and the activities of the
