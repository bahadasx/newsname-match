VODKA NOT MISSED
IN RUSSIA SAYS
COMMITTEE HEAD
Tchaykovsky, Russian Leader, Says
as Result Peasants Have
More Money.
PEOPLE MORE PROGRESSIVE
AND MORE DEPENDABLE
Prohibition Means Better Farms,

NoteIn this sixth article
of Simms' series on the com
mon people of Russia he tells
what they have been given in
place of vodka and how it has
worked out Editor.
By William Philip Simms
(United Press Staff Correspondent)
Petrograd, June 17. (By mail)
"Has the abolition of vodka done any
real good Russia?"
I put this question today to Nich
olas Tchaykovsky, member of the
central committee of Petrograd, as
he sat in front of his desk at com
mittee headquarters. Trier in 1907
as a revolutionist and acquitted, he
is now doing his bit for Russia His
sensitive face, remindful of portraits
of Longfellow, surrounded as it is by
snowy bread, became very eager.
Works Wonders.
"Done any good!" he echoed. "It
has worked wonders. For one thing
it gives Russia a sober peasantry and
a sober peasantry means almost dou
ble working capacity. And over 80
per cent of the Russian population
170,000,000 soulsare peasants. It
means better farms, bigger crops,
more money, better living conditions
in homes, better fed children and
consequently more rapid advance in
schools. Better children make bet
ter men.
"It means a more progressive, more
dependable, richer Russian peasantry.
It means all that and more besides."
Tchaykovsky speaks English flu
ently He moved to Kansas in 1870
and started a community there. A
moral success, it failed for lack of

funds, whereupon the founder went
to Chaster, a, and worked as a
carpenter. Later he got a job in a
Philadelphia sugar mill. Subse
quently to Paris, then to London,
(1905), he returned to the United
States, (1906), on a mission, found
ing Russian committees in New
York, Boston, Baltimore, Philadel
phia, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago,
Denver and other cities In 1907 he
returned to Russia where he was ar
rested and put in prison.
Since 1910 Tchaykovsky has been
working here as a member of the
Central Co-operative committee,
helping co-operative societies get
started and is so happy at the job
that his face positively beams.
Have Fought Drink.
"We have always fought drink,"
he told me," but when vodka was
prohibited our committee asked:
'What are you going to give the peo
ple instead?'
"You know our villages are few
and far between. Our rural districts
are lonely. Vodka was a curse but
it was also a diversion, which was
why it got such a hold on Russia.
"So our thousands of rural co-op
erative societies all over the empire
got busy. We organized diversions
to keep the peasants and villagers
from their vodka.
"Most of our stores, offices, banks
and warehouses are two-storied build
ings. On the ground floor business
is transacted. On the floor above are
halls. These we turned into thea
ters, cinema halls and community
meeting places where folks could
cpme for diversion. We organized
bands, amateur theatricals and so on.
We give concerts. The people come
in droves and everybody has a good
time.
"I don't think the vodka is missed
much.
Have More Money.
"In the meantime peasants have
more money than they ever saw be
fore.
And despite the war our co-opera
tive societies are growing at a won
derful rate.
"In one district alone the number
of co-operative unions has grown
since the war from 50 to 302. We
had only 40 wholesale societies last
year. Now there are over 400. In
1911 there were but 11 credit unions
in all Russia at present there are
over 60 through which about 10,000
co-operative credit societies are work
ing. Our Moscow, or mother, com
mittee alone is co-ordinating the
work of more than 2,000 groups,
each group composed of several so
cieties.
"We have organized a Central Co
operative. Credit bank in Moscow run

like a stock concern, other co-opera
tive credit banks holding the stock.
Though four years old and despite
the war we did a $140,000,000 busi
ness in 1915. This band has its own
office in London executing our for
eign orders, buying and selling. To
show the extent of our business, this
office bought reaper twine in the
United States to the value of $1,500
last year.
Have Own Bank.
"The Siberian societies have their
own bank in London, buy and sell
for themselves.
"We are branching out in every
direction, building our own flour
mills, starch works, oil plants, ma
chine shops and so on We are going
Staro-Bardinsky, in Siberia, we have
our own light plant giving the in
habitants electricity for -a dollar a
year Over 40 papers in Russia are
devoted exclusively to our work.
"Our goods are good goods. Every
thing the best and all for the people.
That is our motto.
"In conjunction with the Zemstvo
Union we are helping Russia and
the allies. Since the beginning of
the war Siberia alone has furnished
the army with 31,000,000 pounds of
butter, with thousands of tons of hay,
with lard, oats and other supplies,
in all about seven million dollars
worth.
"Our best work for Russia, how
ever, has been to make for a pros
perous peasantry, advise it and gen
erally aid it in looking after its in
terests. This has undoubtedly con
tributed to the nation's fighting
strength, therefore, during recent
months we have left strictly war
work to the Zemstvo more while we
have given greater attention to local,
or peasant, needs.
"The total investment in our co-op
eratives is now $500,000,000, or
equal to the Anglo-French war loan
floated in America. We shall con
tinue to increase."
I left the 65-year-old worker smil
ing contentedly. His whole life has
been devoted to his people. Today
his cup of joy is well-nigh full.

Charged That Volstead Sale Held in
May Was Illegal Request
Federal Action.
ACTION MAY HOLD UP
PLACING LANDS FOR TAXES
Chippewa Council Comes to a Close
Twelve Hour Debate on Claims
Report.
Charging that the land sale held
under the Volstead act in Bemidji
last May was illegally conducted on
account of an alleged land men's com
bination, the Chippewa Indians today
passed a resolution requesting that
the Federal government investigate
the sale. If it is found that the sale
was illegally conducted the Indians
request that the government refuse
to issue patents for the land.
To Act Immediately.
The Indian council which was con
cluded today instructed the legisla
tive committee to take the matter up
with the government authorities im
mediately.
If action is taken by the govern
ment it will probably delay the plac
ing of the land on the tax records of
the county If the patents are not
issued the lands will be resold.
Claim Bonuses.
The Chippewa Indians are inter
ested in th. matter as they are
making claim to all the bonuses of
the sale. Whether or not they will
secure the bonuses has not been de
cided A bill was recently submit
ted to congress asking that the bonus-
es-.be turned over to the county in
which the lands are located for the
purpose of maintaining ditches.
All Land Sold.
The land sale over which the ques
tion has arisen was conducted in
May. Heretofore there has been
much competition in regard to secur
ing the land and there was keen bid
ding. This year it is alleged that
the land men had a gentleman's
agreement" not to bid against one
and another and there was no keen
bidding. In this way the lands were
sold practically for taxes, there being
but very few bonuses.
All the land placed on sale was
sold, there being about 150,000 acres
of land sold. Hundreds of buyers
were represented at the sale.
The Chippewa council came to a
close today. Yesterday there was a
12-hour debate on the report of the
claims investigating committee. The
report was adopted.
