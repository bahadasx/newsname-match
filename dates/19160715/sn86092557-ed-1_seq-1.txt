to Secure Appropriation
For It.
WASHINGTON, n. C.. July 15 ?1
The HouBe committee on public build- j
ing and grounds has practically ]
agreed to insert in the omnibus bill j
which it will report within the next |
few days in appropratlon for the pur
chase of a site in Munnington for the
subsequent erection of a government
building.
This fact was established after Con
gressman Neely appeared before that
committee today, and explained the
Ccal situation as it applies to Man
nington. Major Neely had somo
months ago Introduced a bll to appro
priate $100,000 for the purchase of a
site and the erection of a building. Uut
the committee, having agreed to in
clude 150.000 for the erection of a
building at New Martinsville, declined
to provide for a building at Manning

but has practically agreed to include
provision sufficient for the acquisi

It is likely, in view of the site pro
vision being provided for now. that
the appropriation for the Mannington
