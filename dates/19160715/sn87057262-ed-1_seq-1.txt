LONDON', July 15.—The Germans
at one point have been forced back
to the third Una o^ defense under
smashing British blOWs four miles be
hind their original front, General
Haig reported to the war office this
afternoon.
"All is well at the British front,"
said an official statement. "We have
pushed our rear from Fricourt to
Mametz, capturing two thousand
prisoners In twenty-four hours. The
total number of prisoners since the
beginning of our offensive Is now 10,
000. In addition we have taken large
quantities of material."
Heavy German counter attacks
slowed up 'the momentum of the new
British advance, in desperate fighting
on the Ovitlers Longueval front last
night.
Th? British encountered most stub
torn resistance after breaking
through the German second line and
were met by steady sheets of machine
B«n fire In the district north of Long

mined opposition, the British troops
continued to consolidate their posi
tions and break down small German
positions In fighting that continued
well Into the night.
The newly conquered position. In
some cases on the slopes of rolling
hills, whose ridges are held by the
Germans, are being made ready for de

attacks.

hands.
Correspondents at the British front
report hundreds of bodies lie buried
beneath tbe ruins of the town.
"The first fighting for Ovillers has
been hard, bloody and close," said
on© dispatch. "Many of our men died
to gain a yard or two of the earth
works. There have been fights to the
death between a handful of English

Ex-Sea Captain Gives Up the Chase
After Leading the Crowd
For Several
Hours.
MATAWAN, N. J., July 15.—Crowds
of pleasure seekers who would or
dinarily spend their Saturday after
noon at the beaches, wereexpected to
flock here today to join in New
Jersey's game of shark hunting, but
there was little hope held out by the
seasoned hunters that the bis fish
which has killed four persons within
last fortnight will now be caught.
The funerals, of Leslie Stillweli and
Stanley Fisher, the shark's victims,
will be &eld here this afternoon. At
the same time It is believed the search
for the man eater which attacked
them will virtually come to a halt.
There have been rumors of a shark
seen near Keyport, but for twenty
four hours there has not been an
authentic, report of the presence of
the man-idller in Matawan creek. A
railroad engineer reported sighting
he big fish as he passed over a trestle
but this is doubted. Most of the
searchers fear the shark escaped from
the creek soon after killing Stillweli
and Fisher.
Patrol of Matawan creek waa.jty
sumed early today by several men
carrying long pikes. It was not ex
pected. however, that farther dynamit
ing would be done and today's task
may be one of "watchful waiting."
Captain BMward Craven, aged ex
sea captain, who has been one of the
leaders in the hunt for the shark,
gave up completely today.
"The creek, be damned and the
shark be damned, I think Til quit,"
was the way the captain sized things
P.
Acting Mayor Henderson has offer
ed a reward of $100 for the capture
of the shark, and a pro-rata reward
should more- than one of the man
eaters be killed. A movement is on
foot to persuade Governor Fielder to
offer a reward on behalf of the state,
rn the meantime great Interest centr
here in the steps to be taken by
the government. It Is expected reve
nue cutters .will soon patrol the Jer
sey coast.

LA SALLE, 111., July 15.—All at

Oglesby, were abandoned today while
Governor Dunne remained in LaSalle
in hopes of bringing about a settle
ment of the strikes at the plants.
Two hundred and sixty militiamen,
members of five companies of the
Sixth Illinois infantry, encamped at a
c6ol park adjoining the high school
and rested on their arms, pending ad
justment of tbe difficulties.
Committees representing labor
unions in LaSalle, Ogelsby and Peru
called on Governor Dunne early today
protesting against the presence of
troops. They told the governor they
were not needed and that to date,
they had done nothing but pitch tents
and change camps.
Sheriff Davis, however, presented
Dunne with detailed statements of
conditions that he thought necessi
tated a militia guard.
The governor was informed by lead
ers of the twelve hundred strikers to
day that they were ready to confer
with employers. Dunne hoped to bring
about a conference.
Mayor Orr of LaSalle, Mayor Mor

INSTRUCTIONS BY JUDGE
Case Has Cost the County $30,000
and It Took Three Weeks
t'
.1
to Secure a
.- Jury.
COURT ROOM, WATTKBOAN, 111.,
July 15.—JAs the Jury trying Will
Orpet for Marian iLambert's murder
retired today to consider its verdict,
it carried into the Jury room instruc
tions from the court which attorneys
for the defense ibelieved precluded
any verdict other than acquittal.
"Nothing short of proof so clear
and convincing as to exclude 'any
reasonable hypothesis of Innocence
will satisfy a conviction and without
ouch iproof the Jury must find him
not guilty," Judge Chas. H. Donnelly
declared. "A mere possibility is not
sufficient.1
r,
added that th&
he evf
ry must consider the efidence as a
whole and that If they firmly believ
ed, despite contradictory evidence,
that Orpet gave Marian cyanide of
potassium, whether he or she brought
it to Helms woods, they should find
him guilty of murder.
"But if you believe that the evi
dence has shown Marian had the
same opportunity of taking the poison
herself that Orpet had of giving it to
hfcr, your verdict should be not
guilty."
The state, which has builded Its
chain of circumstantial evidence lin'K
by link about the murder theory, did
not seem chagrinned^by the Instruc
tions. States Attorney Dady felt that
the evidence had been so placed be
fore the Jury that a motive for mur
der had been established.
Judge Donnelly's instructions came
after a dramatic closing plea for
conviction by Special Prosecutor
Joslyn.
Not guilty, guilty with death pen
alty, guilty with life Imprisonment
and guilty with an Indeterminate
prison sentence are the four possible
verdicts.
The Orpet tragedy to date has cost
!Lake county approximately $30,000.
Three weeks were spent in selecting
the Jury, most of whom are farmers.
The trial proper has been under way
five weeks.
Marian was found dead beneath the
Three Oaks in Helms woods on Feb
ruary 19, 19-16. Orpet, a student at
the University of Wisconsin, was ar
rested a day later. He had endeav
ored to establish an alibi, but finally
admitted he was in the woods with
[Marian when she died. He said 'he
did not see her take poison, but
presumed, she had killed herself be
cause he wished to break off their
romance. The state charged he gave
her cyanide under the guise of an
abortive to get rid of her because he
wanted to marry Celestia Youker.
Orpet is Just past 21. Marian, a
high school girl, was 18 a few days
before her death. It was a boy and

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 15.—
With the naval collier Hector ibroken
in two 'by yesterday's storm and
abandoneu late last night, a radio
message today brought word to the
navy yard that all on board had been
saved.
The crew and the company of
marines, carried 'by the Hector were
taken aboard the tug Wilmington
and the lighthouse tender Cypress
shortly before daylight.
The Hector was abandoned at 12:45
a. m., seven miles northeast of Cape
Romaine.
When last seen she was a total
wreck. All who were aboard, Includ
ing G. F. Newell, her master, are
proceeding to Charleston aboard the
rescue vessels.
At 2:05 yesterday afternoon the
Hector first flashed her distress call,
saying she was fourteen miles south
of Charleston with a list of ten de
grees starboard. Twenty minutes
later she sent another SOS with, the
cry "believe we are sinking."
The etWtf ttr'' Alamo Immediately
sped to her assistance and was fol
lowed quickly by the tug Vigilant.
Captain Hunt of the latter vessels,
reported, however that he was un
able to get within three miles of tho
Hector, and that statlo conditions
prevented her from communication
with the Alamo by wireless. Just
after the wireless telling that the
Hector was sinking, the collier flash
ed to the navy yard, "Crew to leave.
Send help," and nothing further was
heard until 3:65 when Newell wire
lessed "Hector aground ten miles
southeast of Charleston lightship.
Breaking in two. Rus{i help."
Ten minutes later the last mes
sage, "send help at once," was sent
the Alamo which was standing by.
Then the wireless failed.
Immediately after the Hector's
first distress .call at Charleston, calls
from the Arlington, Va., radio sta
tion were heard asking any vessel to
go to the Hector's assistance.
The 'Hector had left Port (Royal for
Santa Domingo, carrying marine re
cruits for the latter place and Cuba.
She Intended to put into port here
when the storm disabled "her, but
according to Captain Hunt, was un
able to get further than within nine
miles and a half of the Charleston
lightship before sinking.
The Hector carried a crew of
twelve officers and fifty men and six
ty marines.
The Hector was built in 1908, one
of the first of the new type of naval
colliers. She was 383.9 feet long, 52.5
feet broad and had a draft of 24.5
feet.
The destroyer Terrv which was re
ported in distress off here last night,
is waiting outside of the harbor in
tow of the wrecking 'ug Relief for
a pilot. She will dock this morning.
The Terry was being towed from
Santo Domingo, wher» she ran
aground several weeks ago.

WAS BEATEN TO DEATH
Insane Robber, Recerrtly Escaped

Letter*
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., July 15.—Lured
from home by a fake telephone call,
Oscar D. McDanlel, county prosecut
ing attorney, returned to find his wife
beaten unconscious, apparently at
tacked while she slept. She died of
her injuries this morning, in a local
hospital.
The murderer fired several shots at
McDanlel as he hurried home, fear
ing a plot.
An Insane robber who recently es
caped from the state hospital and
who had written several letters
threatening the life of tho prosecutor,
Is believed by the police to have
killed Mrs. McDanleL
Two children asleep in an adjoin
ing room, slept peacefully while their
mother was fatally beaten.
Shortly before midnight last night
McDanlel was called to the phone and
told to come down town to a saloon
where his. brother was in trouble.
When he arrived at the saloon in his
motor car, he learned that his brother
had not been there and that no one
there had telephoned him.
Fearing treachery, McDanlel sped
home, to be greeted by bullets fired
from behind a tree. The attorney re
turned the fire at a man fleeing In
the darkness. Whether he hit his
mark is unknown.
Rushing Into his home, McDanlel
found his wife, beaten unconscious,
blood spattered on the bed clothing.
When her crushed body was taken to
the hospital, the prosecutor collapsed.
Search of the house revealed the
theft of Mrs. McDanlel's diamond wed
ding ring and other jewelry, Indicat
ing that robbery may have been the
motive.
Police said there was no evidence
of a struggle. Beneath the woman's
pillow lay her revolver. It had not
been tpuched.

BERLIN, July 15.—Berlin is anx
iously awaiting a decision by the
American state department on the
status of the submarine Deutschland.
A formal finding that the Deutsch
land Is a merchantman, In the face of
protests of allied diplomats, will go a
long way toward convincing Germans
that America is really trying to be
neutral. At the same time it will be
a Wow to the Von Tirpitz supporters
who have (been urging a disregard
for American opinion and the resump
tion of former submarine policies.
Ambassador Gerard has received
certain confidential Inflormatloai re
garding the Deutschland, but he will
not discuss It in any way.
Tbe American consuls at Bremen
and Berlin denied today that they had
been asked by Washington why they
had not reported the iDeutschland's
departure. Such a report was re
ceived here from London. They said
they knew nothing of the Deutsch.
land's departure.
A Peaceful Ship.
WASHINGTON, July 15.— The
state department announced today it
considers the Deutschland a peaceful
ship, "in view of all the facts in the
case." There will be no formal deci
sion by Acting Secretary of State
Polk.
Polk notified Secretary of the
Treasury McAdoo informally of his
opinion. The state department an
nounced the opinion may not make
precedent and that arrival of another
submarine liner would be treated as
a separate and independent case.
The acting secretary today express
ed displeasure at morning newspaper
stories purporting to relate the find
ings of the neutrality board. He said
the reports did the board a great in
justice, but that he could not reveal
the contents of the report.
