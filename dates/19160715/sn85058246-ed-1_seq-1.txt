I IS BACK HOME
I FROMTHE EAST
fl
HJ Congress Joseph Howoll, taking ad-
M vantage of tlio halt In bUBlnrss tn the
HJ blouse, returned from Washington on
H Thursday night, bringing his family
H homo for the summer.
H in an Interview the congressman
H declared that war has given this na-
H tlon temporary, spotted and Bpasmod-
H lc prosperity, but no one can Iw so
H blind as not to understand that pre-
H pent conditions are duo entirely to
H the calamity of the blood soaked
I battlefields of Europe.
I "Tho people" cannot bo deceived and
will not forget that during tho first
I nine months of the present regime
H under peaco conditions the nation
I was swiftly drifting toward deprcs
I slon and hard times, which was tern
I porarily averted by tho unprecedeiit
H cd demands upon us as a result of
tho world wldo wnr.
"In tho words of Lincoln, You can
I not fool all th people all tho time,
I nnd tho Wilson administration has
I been weighed In tho bnlanco of pub
I lie opinion and found to be lnslncero
I shifty, totally wanting In that great
I strength of purpose, stability and
I statesmanship demanded at tho helm
I of Btato.
I An Urcertaln Policy
I "Tim wlshv washy, lndeclslvo and
I uncertain policy of our Btato depart
I ment during this administration will
I inako an Inglorious chapter In our
history. Watchful, waiting and med-
dlesomo Intervention havo wrought
I their disastrous work in distracted
Mexico.
I "Tho President "while declaring for
I hands off In Mexico and conceding to
I Mexico tho right to establish Its own
B form of government and the rlRht to
"4 destroy as much property and shed
I" as much blood as sho pleases In do
ing It has twice committed an act of
ar upon Mexico, apparently with-
out purpose or objective. It li be-
lloved that secret orders havo already
been Issued for tho withdrawal ot
our forces with a roward to Carran.o
In tho form of a substantial reward
for his Ingratltudo and stubbornness
"Our performances In tho fiascos
with Mexico are as purposeless but
moro tragic as that ot the famous
king of Franco who gaily marched his
army up tho hill and marched down
again. Evidently President Wilson
Is merely toying with Mexico, per
forming tho Juggler's feat of balanc
ing between war and peaco with his
finger on tho trigger of cvonts to pull
a tho exigencies may develop.
Utah's Plain Duty
"All honest, patriotic nnd progres
sive people In Utah will feel a thrill
of pride In tho knowledgo that Utah
stands in tho front rank of tho na
tional Republican councils. Our min
ing, manufacturing, llvo stock nnd
agriculture Interests aro wrapped up
In tho principles of the Republican
party. Tho permanent progress and
(prosperity of our state depend upon
tho maintenance and development of
Republican policies.
"The Ilopubllcan parly Is again
coming into power. It calls upon
Utah to do its part by returning a
Republican senator, two Republican
" members of tho Houso and by giving
Its electoral voto to Charles K.
Hughes.
"Anything less than this would be
a state disaster and n betroynl of tlio
party that has and will champion tho
policies that Ho at tho root of our
prosperity. We hnv well defned
nnd clenn cut lssuos that engago our
jjg attention, but wo must not overlook
Hie Importance of tho aspects of our
I national politics. The Republican
party must bo tho Interpreter of tjio
3 poople's will and cannot shirk Its
u responsibility without repudiation and
defeat. Wo havo local questions that
tax our wisdom nnd dovclop sharp
differences of opinion, but wo must
declaro ourselves plainly, not ovnslVQ
S ly, upon them and retain' tho confld-
ence of tho peoplo by making their
B will effectively by law,"
Mrs. Howell and chlldron accom
K panted tho congressman homo, nnd
V they will spend the summer in Lo
jn can. The Howell family returnu
K Kollng vroll and glad to bo hack homo
ngaln to enjoy the ussoclutlon of
friends and relatives,
R Congressman Howell went to Salt
I Lake yesterday morning after spend-
inB tho night In Logan. Ho enpects
m to return about Sunday.

DAYLIGHT FIRE
DESTROYS BARN
IN 2ND WARD
A Are Thursday afternoon In Mio
Socond ward destroyed tho hay b.irn
of Arthur Ames. It lg thought that
tho blaze started from spontaneous
combustion. Considerable now liny
bad recently been stacked in tho burn
A alunbte mare and colt wero In
cluded In tho loss sustained through
the lire.
Tho dry lumber burned so rapidly
U.at by tho time tho department .ir
rived on tlio sceno, all the goo-l It
could do was to prevent n further
spread of tho fire.
Tho practice Is growing not to ring
tlio lira bell when nn alarm Is turn
ed in. There may bo somo good and
sulllclent reasons for this practice,
but H Is a well known fact that un
less somo warning Is given, persoiis
using tho city water do not know
that they should turn It off from the
lawns.
This may account In a large meas
ure for the low pressure which main
tains some times when a good pres
sure Is wanted to bnttlo with tlio '.Ho
