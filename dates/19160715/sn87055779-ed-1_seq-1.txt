FA PASO. Texas, July. K..
"Pancho" Villa has whipped trie
Carranza, armie? sent against him
southeast of Jimincz and below
Parral. Gen. Frnesto Jarcia, who
started out bravely with :!,ftno men
to drive Villa across the Ilio Flor
ida, has returned to Parral ard is
preparing that town auainst a sec
ond attack.
Two trainloads of wounded Cnr
ranistas have been taken to Chi
huahua City from the Jiminez battle
ground. This news reached tho
border today aloni; with a boast
from Villa that he will take Chihua
hua City inside of two months and
use that scene of many revolutions
as his capital.
The Käme reports Fay that Villa's
nrmy now numbers R.ono. The Villa
forces are strnnejy entrenched in
their base alonsr the bottom of the
KJo Florida and detachments of
outlaws are operating vigorously
from that base.
Villa's agents from tho interio
are arriving in El Paso to meet arms
and ammunition agents anl Villa's
permanent representatives here dis
play a fresh cush of prosperity that
speaks "well for the exchequer of
the renecade leader.
Iaplain I'k of Official News.
The stories told by the newly ar
rived atrents do much to explain the
lark of official news from Carranza
headquarters as to tho outcome of
tho fiphtinir round Jiminer. and
Parral. Mexican officials do not
clutter up their records with re
port of defeats. They tind it much
more convenient to forget the de
feated army.
The Villa, representatives laugh
when one mention that the United
States and Carranza are peacefully
arransirp for a point- air.fV rence for
lh? settlement of all international
difficulties;.
"You can't settle Pancho Villa
with a joint committee," they s;.y.
"It the United State ive 'ar
ranza all the favors it wishes. Car
ranza is through. Pancho Villa is
the real power in Mexico and ho
will be its ruler."
One of the Villa detachments is
reported operating in the Lacuna
district. This is north of Chihuahua. '

International News Servle:
WASHINOTON. July 13. Artim?
Sec'y of State Polk today formally
declared the Gojm.in super-submarine
Deutso'.iand to be a merchant
man and announced that the vessel,
now at Baltimore, would be so treat
ed by this government.
The official announcement follows:
"In view of the facts of this par
ticular rase I see no reason to de
clare the Deutschland a ship of war.
( Signed
"Frank E. Polk,
"Actini; Secretary of State."
No Pre t-deiit IMaldi-dird.
Mr. Polk pointed out, however,
that tho Deutsehland was one specific-
case, and that no general prec
edent was bein established bv his
rulinu'. He intimated that if other
Gorman submarines of the Deutsch
land type arrive in American ports,
each one would have to be consid
ered separately before beinu accept
ed by this government as a mer
chantman. Mr. Polk said he saw no reason
why the submarine could not clear
from P.altimore when its commander
desired.
Immediate action is expected to be
taken by the British and French
embassies in the case now that the
state department has handed down
its decision.

The above is a picture of one of the school of man-eatin? sharks with which thp Eastern coast is alive.
The shark menace has practically stopped beach bathing, because of the vast number of sharks near the
coast.
Thus far, the sharks have claimed a number of victims within the last few days and the ticerish way
in which the shark seizes its prey makes for an awful death, rescue beim; practically impossible.
Peach patrols have been organized and every effort is beins made to capture the man-eaters.

AT TUR RKITISH FRONT IN
FRANCE", July 14. 10 p. m. via Ixn
don, July 15. At this writing, at the
end of a long day's unbroken strug
gle, rumors indicate that the British
are holding their gains from morn
ing when a front of about four miles
was attacked along the second Ger
man line of trenches, though the
Germans counter-attacked violently.
Infantry that went in shortly be
fore dawn expected the most de
termined resistance and to pay a
high toll in casualties. Their ex
perience gained in many night
trench rfcdds served as excellent prep
aration for the daring action in the
' moonlight over a long front where
the mos", minute co-ordination was
necessary for success. "
Small Number of Wounded.
As an unexpected small number of
wounded came into the clearing sta
tions in the morning hours, many
being carried by German prisoners
acting af stretcher bearers, the sat
isfaction over the news that three
villages had been taken increased.
Prisoners said that no attack had
been expected and that the assault
before day light was a complete eur
prise. The British rushed into the sham
bles of Trones woods, where the
Germans had regained a small po
sition, sweeping from one side to
the other through the tangled and
fallen trunks. asainst persistent
sniping and machine gun fire and
under conditions where it was ditfi-
cult to tell friend from foe.
Here Po mm, left when the Brit
ish were forced out. were rescued.
Though fhort of water and rations
they built barricade.-, and dug shel
ters amors the roots and refused to
counter-attack would effect their
rescue.
Among them were wounded who
were unable to stand, but who could
still fire their rifles.
Hail Tliclr Hcxaicrs.
As they saw the dim figures in
khaki coming to their rescue they
set up a shout:
"This w ay! Are w e dow n
hearted?" The advance was a frontal sweep
up the slopes into the second line
and the two Rezantine villages and
Longueval. The gun tire this time
seems to have left only one point in
the trenches where the mac. line
guns were; not out of action, and
the demolition was complete. Hero
for a spa?e of two hundred yards
the tide of English went past while
the Germans in this ection of
trenches refused to yield and for
some time desperately held out in a
fashion ch iracteristic of the kind of
fighting that is marking the Somm
battle.
Prisoners taken belonged to bat
talions of different divisions hushed
to the scene after July 1 and seemed
to lack tho usual efficient organiza
tion. Jlritish Continue IYnanl.
The British carried on beyond th
second line when they found the
prisoners and seeking to gain higher

points on the ridge. The Germans
besran to develop stronger resistance

Wypiszynski was passed unanimous

upon recommendations of the bar

which investigated the charges, in
the bigamy case of John Iuiiik,

The technical grounds upon which
Wypiszynski is disbarred is that
Mrs. John Ionik, No. U, havin-;
