Troops Under Gen. Haig
Strike at Dawn Along
Four-Mile Front.
BA7fLE HAND TO HAND
(y the Interattewal News Servies.)
London. July 14-Gen. Sir Douglas Haig
ruck again at dawn today. Tonight the
front has been advanced three
miles to the eastward. It rests on a line
from Besantian LO Petit to LanguevaL.
Both vileages are in English hands. Be
yond the latter place the British troops
are ighting forward in the wooded sec.
tion, In desperate hand-to-hand engage
ments with the German.
The British blow fell on a front at
four miles east, and north of Contalmal
son. The German second system of de
fense was shattered. The British ad
vanes at its deepest point tonight ap
protmated three miles.
The British artillery, according to all
dispatches from the front, made the first
stages of the attack a matter of com
parative ease. The Germnan resistance
grew more stubborn as the line psed
forward, however, and tonight favieft
counter-attacks are beog lapnched along
the entire new front.
One German attack resulted in the
recapture of Besantin Le Petit, but the
British came up in renewed force and
won back the village.
The effect of the British guns on the
German defenses is described as annihi
lating.
One of the first results of the British
charge was the complete recepture of the
Trones wood and the rescue of a gallant
little detchment of the Royal West
Kents, who. for forty-eight hours with
eut food or drink, had held out against
messes of Germans in the northern part
of the forest. They had been out off
during a German 0ounter-ettack two days
advance is one of the greatest

P ofensive. It brings the British
front on an even line with the
at Hardecort and puts the Eng
good position to drive a wedge

WILSON READY S
TO ARBITRATE
President Believed to Favor
Plan for Mediating Con
troversy with Mexico.
After the Cabinet meeting yesterday it
was learned that President Wilson had
endorse_ the idea of submitting the Mex
lean border controversy to the arbitra
tration of commissioners appointed on
each side.
The President's action, however, is con
ditionned upon an advance agreement be
tween the two governments as to the
scope of the commipsloners' power and t
other details which have been discussed
informally by Acting Secretary of State
Polk and Ellsceo Arredondo. the Mexican
Ambassador designate.
Indications yesterday were that Polk
and Arredondo had practically agreed up
on the essential points of these advance
negotiations. Several members of the
Cabinet understood that Mr. Polk would
make a public announcement on the ques
tion, but the latter confined this an
nouncement to saying that "matters were
progressing satisfactorily."
It was later stated that Mr. Polk desires
to be very sure of his ground before mak
ing any formal statement. There are still d
some points undecided which may upset
the negotiations at the eleventh hour. 4
The Idea of a settlement of the contro
versy by commissioners Is based on Ar
tide XXI of the treaty of peace signed
in 1048 by the United States and Mexico.
