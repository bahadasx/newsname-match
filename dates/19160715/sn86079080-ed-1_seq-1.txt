i'ANOTER TO HER SON.
Spir of True Lee MW seeret
It has been our privilege to
read a letter from the mother of
one of the Natchez soldier boys,
now under orders for possible
service in Mexico. This letter,
written by a Missiaippi woman
to her son as he is on the eve of
entering the serviceof his c un
try, impressed us so vividly with
the spirit r4 true love and dacri
flee that we have obtainod per
mission to reproduce it, omitting
only the name of the sender and
receiver. The letter is as follows:
"My Darling Son: - I see from
the Natches paper that your
J company is expecting immediate
orders to go inteeamp. What do
you think of it, and what arran
gements will you make? I have
been expecting this for the past
year, and I am anxious and dis
tresesed to think of the hardships
and danger you may have to go
through.
"The bare thought of the poe
sible separation from your papa
nearly breaks my heart, but I
am not the kind of a woman to
hold either of you back from the I
call of your country. There is no I
higher honor to my mind than a
soldier's duty faithfully perform
ed, and even though my heart I
might break with the sorrow of 1
giving you two up, I would hang 1
my head in shame if either one of I
you proved unworthy. I
"So if you find the honorable
thing. to do is to share in yourl
company's duty, do it my boy i
with a free heart. There is noth
ing finer braver or truer in the
life of a man than to follow your
flag when your country is in dan- l
, andno mother is worthy i
e honor of having borne a son,
would hold him in a coward's
rite me of your plans. I'm
al thatJackson is to be
Thanks.

Infantile Paralysis.
Infantile paralysis which is
killing children by the score in
New York and other American
cities, caused one death in New
Orleans Tuesday night. Two
suspected cases are undr observa
tion.
State and cityhealth boardoffic
lals have no fear of an epidemic
but do insist that precautions
should be taken by parents. Dr.
O'Reilly, of the city board, states
since 1911 there have been but 46
known cases here and two deaths
Pora Parker, 6 year-old negro
girl, died at 8:05 o'clock Tuesday
night in Charity Hospital, having
been admitted theire July 9, Vir
ginia Menninger, 19 months old
white, of 2323 Banks street, is
now in the contagious ward of
the hospital afflicted with the
same disease. She was admitted
July 6 and physicians believe she
has a chance to recover. The
third case is that of a 15-month
old child with infantile paralysis
at 2611 D'Abadle street. Hope is
entertained that this one will re
eva also.
Parents of the little negro girl
who died from the disease Tues
day are not known. She was taken
to the hospital in a city wagon,
the driver stating he had taken
her from a train and her home
was in "Arbath.," La. No such
town is known. The board of
health requires that bodies of per
sons dying from the desease be
buried without delay so the hospi
tal authorities will inter the girl's
body Wednesday afternoon in
Potter's field,
"We are taking every possible
precaution," said Dr. Gallant, the
assistant superintendent of the
hospital Wednesday morning,
"and have isolated all cases in
the contagious ward.
Dr. O'Reilly, of the city board,
reported to the board Tuesday
night that deaths in the city from
all causes for the six months end
ing June 80 were 539 fewer than
for the same period last year.
The total for the first six months I
in 1915 was 3975 and for the six
months just ended; 8436. Mort
ality of communicable diseases
for June sholrs a decrease of 60
per cent, compared with June 1
last year or May this year.
State Board Active.
Though the state board of
health officials do not anticipate
any spread of the epidemic of in
fantile paralysis to Louisiana,
precautions are being taken to
guard against it.
Miss Agnes Morris, head of
the bureau of child hygiene, at
the instance of Dr. Oscar Dowl
ling, president of the board, is
sending out letters to all the
health officers throughout the
state calling on them to keep a
close watch and report any cases
of infantile paralysis to the board
immediately on their develop
ment
The board is also preparing a
statement showing what pre
cautions should be taken.
"There is only one thing.to do
really," said Miss Maorris, "and
that is complete solatlon of any
and every case.
"We do not want to frighten
anyone however, and we are
taking irsoautions merely to be
o the usfe side, but we do not

e permanent peace by mutual un
, derstanding rather than by
force, and for business prepared

us, for a good many years to
teach politics, as well as else
wher, this lesson, that we are
all in the same boat," he said.
"We have common interests,
and it is our bubaless to under.

that l omfronted us. sentl

deliberately looked at these com

from others and as if some of as
