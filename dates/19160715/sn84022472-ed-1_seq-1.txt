SUICIDE, FINDING
OF CORONER ON
CASE
Murder '.Theory of Stratford
Youth's Father. Not
Founded in Fact,
The theory that 19 -year-old Charles
E. Thompson of Stratford was mur
dered was shattered today when Coro
ner John J. Phelan made a finding in
which he declared the young man had
come lo his death by suicide. This
supports the report of Medical Ex
aminer Cogswell of Stratford. ' i
. E..C. Thompson, father of the, boy,
maintained from the first that his son
had beem murdered and he scorned
the suicide idea. . It was the' elder
Thompson whA'said there were spots
of blood on the side of the house
where the body was found. . At the
request of the father the coroner
started an investigation, which was
finished today.
In spite of the fact that witnesses
yesterday declared the blood on the
house came from a chicken killed for
Sunday dinner, Thompson insisted
two other witnesses had ', seen the
blood. His son-in-law, Herbert Chris
tianson, said he had Visited the scene
of the crime but denied seeing any
blood. William Thompson, son of E.
C. Thompson, declared - he had seen
blood. He admitted he hadn't said
anything about this to Christlanson
although the latter was with him at
the time.
Medical Examine Cogsll said he
didn't recall E. C. Thompson had told
anything about seeing blood. It is
generally believed that Thompson is
unstrung because his brother, son and
niece have died'w'thin a shor time.
