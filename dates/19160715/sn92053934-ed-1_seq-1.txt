violation of the agreement by Germany
being alleged. The situation is such
that t.he relations of Italy and Ger
many seem to have reached a greater
tension than at any time since the
war be pan.
Before leaving Rome in the spring
of 1915, Prince von P.uelow, then Ger
man ambassador to Italy, concluded
an agreement with the Italian govern
ment under which, in case of war be
tween Austria and Italy, Germany and
Italy pledged themselves to respect the
properties and lives of their respec
tive subjects. This meant for Ger
jmany a guarantee of several million
I dollars worth of properties in Italy
j held here by subjects and for Italy the
j safety of 30,000 of citizens still liv
I ing in Germany.
I No state of war exists between Ger
imany and Italy and the agreement ne
jpotiaTed by Prince von Ruelow is still
i in force. Italy, according to official
; opinion here, has faithfully observed
,ne agreement. On the other hand, er-
many is unofficially accused of depriv- j
ing Italians in Germany of their lib
erty of action, preventing men of mili
tary age from leaving the country, sus
pending payments due Italians and
treating them as subjects of a hostile
power.
Accordingly a demand now is being
voiced for abrogation of the agreement
which, in addition to the alleged dis
regard of its provisions by Germany
has resulted in misunderstandings in
allied nations regarding the situation,.

PRESS CENSORSHIP
APPLIED BY SPAIN
Madrid, July 15, (via Paris, S:H0 a.
m.) The government lias established
a military censorship of all press dis
patches. Martial law was declared
throughout Spain on Thursday as a re

ously affected operations of lines of
the northern system. A Madrid dis
patch on the night of July 13 said a
general strike had been announced
for July 16.
THE WAR TODAY
The British in their offensive
have swept forward on a four mile
front and captnred several vil
lages. The strategic importance of the
British successes is marked by the
straightening of their line in eon
fomiitj with that of the French
who had hitherto adaneed at
greater sp-'d than their allies.
The lire i it y of the preliminary
bombardment and the fact that
British losses were comparatively
small, lend support to unofficial
statements that the Ocrniaii sec
ond line was much less stromrly
fortified than their tirst defenses.
French official statements that
bombardment of (Jernian positions
on the Belgian front had reached
jrreat inteisity are interpreted as
indicutinir that another great for
ward movement by the entente al
lies may be attempted at the ex
treme western end of the battle
line.
The only actions reported on the
Verdun front Friday were assaults
made by the French.
The great battle of the Stokhod
on the Itussian front is still nur
inir. From the Faucasus (irarid

PETITIONS FILED
FOR STATE JOBS
More Than a Thousand Papers Re
eeived Before Noon Dunne's One
of First Two Opened
Springfield, 111 July 15. Among
the iirst petitions to be opened the of
fice of secretary of state today were
those of Governor Edward F. Dunne
for renomination on the democratic
ticket and of Mayor Woodruff of Pe
oria for nomination for governor on
The republican ticket. 'At 10 o'clock
this morning between 1,000 and 1.200
petitions had been received, according
to Secretary of State Stevenson.
For the first time in years the cor
ridors of the state house were not
crowded with candidates anxious to
get their petitions in first. Secretary
Stevenson was enforcing a new rule
whereby petitions coming through the
mails were given preference.
About, a score of candidates hovered
about the secretary's door but they
were not even admitted to his office.
A few personal friends tackled him as
he passed in or out of his office and
attempted to band him their petitions,
but. all were turned away and told to i
drop the petitions in the federal mail
box.
Mr. Stevenson said all the petitions !
thus far received could not be opened
until late tonight and for that reason
the list of candidates probably would
not be given out until tomorrow or
Monday. It will take a staff of attor
neys several days to go over the peti
tions and decide on their legality.
With few exceptions the present
state officials filed petitions for their
renomination at the September pri
mary election. State Treasurer Rus
sel is a candidate for the republican
nomination for state auditor.
James J. Brady, present auditor, is a
candidate for renomination on the
democratic ticket.

KEEPING HIM AWAKE NIGHTS
Senor in Bad
for Theft of
Rare Violin
Chicago, July 15. Victor Vitromili,
23, said to be the heir to the wealth of
a prominent family at Buenos Aires,
will be arraigned in police court here
today on the charge of larceny, all for
the love of a rare violin. The instru
ment, the alleged theft of which land
ed the young Spaniard in a cell, is the
property of Edward F. Morgan, a not
ed amateur painter and is said to be a
valuable European importation.
Vitromili came to Chicago two
weeks ago with letters of recommen
dation from high Argentine officials.
Alfred F. Brick wood, Jr., Argentine
consul in Chicago, took an interest in
him and invited him to his home
where Morgan resides. One evening
the young Spaniard saw and played
upon the violin. After that his visits
became more frequent, each time his
one idea apparently being to play upon
the instrument.
As bis attachment grew, the police
say, Vitromili sought to purchase the
violin but Morgan refused to part with
it. Thursday night after Vit romili's
visit to the Brikwood home, the violin
was missing and yesterday the young
man was arrested upon a warrant is
sued at the request of Morgan. Later
according to the police, he admitted
the theft and told where the violin
could be f6und.
