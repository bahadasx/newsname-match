FINE FIGGERER
IS SEN. SUTTON
It is pardonable, in political parlance, to hark back to qttipt
and phrases and observations and mottoes that have grown
mossy with age.
Thus, it is always permissible in introducing the candidate of
the evening to gaze at the audience in a manner that should
make them think you have taken them dose to your heart and
k revealed your innermost secret when you remark:
"And now, fellow voters, we have with us Mr. So-and-So,
whote life and record have been an open book."
fc Taking advantage of the said ]x>litieal license, we are willing
4o admit that Senator \V. J. Sutton's record has been an "open
book" —except in one particular.
Question Is, What Does "W. J." Stand For?
No one yet has learned what the "\V. J." stands for. So far
as public documents are concerned, there is a deep, dark mys
tery about it. It is even gravely hinted that W. J. himself has
* forgotten what they used to denote. Political enemies of the
senator from Cheney. Wash., who is now a candidate for the
governor's chair, have been mean enough to charge that, though
the senator is a republican, \Y. J. can stand for nothing else than
William Jennings.
Horrible! Yea, horrible!
But while Senator SuttOfl may thus have a mark against him
literally, he toes the line and sizes up in Class A when you con
sider him figurally.
He's a Champeen at Figgers, Is Sutton
' Figurally — not figuratively, mind you —Senator Sutton
reckons and must be recokned with. A few years ago when
W. J. was too young to be a state senator and just old enough
to quit school and go out into the big world to carve out fame
for himself, he was told the old one about looking before
leaping.
MFigUK it out ahead," he was- admonished.
And \V. J. never forgot the lesson.
'At a figurer, he's the final WOfi, or number, «v should say.
lie's so precise that way that when he reached six feet in
height, he quit growing. He figured just that much and no
more.
Figures Differently From Gov. Lister
Naturally, then, when Sutton, just six feet in height, got to
teaching at the normal school at Cheney, Wash., it was as a
professor of mathematics.
After two or three years of that. Sutton figured there was

WAUKBGAN, 111., July 15.—
The case of Will H. Orpet, Univer
sity of Wisconsin student, charged
with the murder of Marlon Lam
bert, was given to the Jury this
afternoon.
Counsel for the defendant said
that Judge Donnelly's instructions
were tantamount to a command
to tho jury to acquit.
An audience, mostly women,
from white-haired grandmother*
to half-frightened school girls,
packed Judge Donnelly's court
room.
Orpet seemed more cheerful at
the prospect of the ending of the
period of suspense.

HERE IS
135 FOR
BABIES!
By Freddie Film
The next number on the
program, TtOOBII mothers
and fatbnrn, is to determine
who has tIM handsomest
))it liy.
Mring on your landidates
and join with all the other
folks in the voting. This I*
an election year; why not an
election for the infants?
And, as if there wasn't
sufficient excitement in the
mere election itself, let is
hasten to explain that there
is more thnn mere glory in
it for the successful babies.
For Instance:
A $20 first prize.
A 910 '."•■(■nil prize.
A $n third prize.
Two free tickets for the
parents of every baby enter
ed to the greatest film ever
taken in which the subject of
babies centers.
And now, to start with a
new breath, and to begin at
the beginning, it is this way:
The big mid-summer baby
contest ih the joint undertak
ing of A. C. Anderson, man
ager of the Apollo theater,
and The Times.
Any baby in this section of
the state is eligible to enter.
All the parents have to i<>
is to take their kiddie to die
Jackson studio, in the Ber
lin building, next Tuesday Of
any day before a week from
next Tuesday.
Mr. Jackson has estab
lished a great record lor
photographing babies. ><c
will make a fine photograph
of the youngsters. ALSO !1E
WILL HAND THK FOND
PARENTS A PASS FOR
TWO SEATS AT THK
APOLLO THEATER GOOD
FOR THE WEKK WHEN
THE BABY FILM IS TO BE
SHOWN. (We'll explain
about that later.)
That Ib, he'll hand out two
tickets if the child is brougit

he is li-sh busy; if the call is
In the afternoon, he'll give
one pass.
After Tuesday, the IStfc,
when the picture-taking
endt, Jackson will have four
>l:i>s to finish the photos up,
and on Sunday, the 30th,
they will be placed on ex
hibition in the foyer of the
Apollo.
They will remain there for
all Apollo patrons to see nnd
compare for one week.
All the parents who have
been given passes and cv- '
erybody else who buys a tick

alno.
• • •
The film which runs dur
ing the week of the 30th 1%
entitled, "Where Are My
Children?" and Is heralded
as a great birth control
preachment.
That it does not treat this
delicate subject in a manner
to offend Anybody's sensibili
ties, The Times has been As
sured in letters from big rep
resentative men who have
seen it in other cities. Among
those who have given us
these assuri nceg, are pastors
of Catholic, .Jewish and Pro
testant denominations.
That film, together with
the Anna Pavlowa film which
is coming to the Apollo next
week, but which, of course,
has no connection with it ex
cept that the state's rights to
its production are owned by
the same man, is the most
expensive, from tbe pro
ducer's standpoint, of any
ever shown in Taroraa. The
Apollo broke all former rec
ords for high prices when it
signed up for the picture.

And now the firat thing to
do is to get those kiddles to
the photographer in their
best bibs and tuckers.

watching the whale, which Is said
to be the first seen here in 20
years.
It was discovered In the bay
early yesterday morning.
The steamboat Victor, leaving
for Tacoma, encountered the
whale, which could not get out
through the shallow passage.
The boat was obliged to concede
the right-of-way.
the length of the mammal Is
various estimated at from 35 to
100 feet, according to the ex
citement of the teller of the story.
All, at least, agree that It i«
longer than the Victor.
J. D. Rlley telephoned for his
son, Attorney Frank Riley of Ta
coma, to bring a harpoon and un
dertake the capture of the big
fish in the traditional manner.
Great interest attends young
Rlley's arrival.
Among those who are out in
rowhoats on the bay, is a young
woman, who went to get a photo
graph. The whale rose and blew
close beside her boat, greatly to
her consternation.
