InStruotions to Jury.
At the close of Joslyn's argument
Judge Donnelly delivered his Instruc
tions to the Jury. Excerpts follow:
Proof Must Be Convincing.
"Nothing short of proof so clear and
convincing as to exclude every rea
sonable hypothesis of, his innocence
such proof the jury must find the de
fendant not guilty.
"To warrant a conviction tfee de
fendant must br proven gvjllty so
clearly that there Is no. doubt of the
theory that he can not be innocent.
.."Unless you find beyond all reason
ably doufbt fn considering the evidence
that the defendant had potassium' in
his possession, just before the death
of Mariani, then you should find him
guilty.
Flight Not Evidence of Guilt^vS'
"Flight, tho a circumstance to be
weighed against the defendant, is not
of a conclusive character and may not
tie evidence of guDt If there was any
other motive for
If
than a sense of
guilt.
"I# thfre are two theories, one for
guilt and the other for innocenee, then
adopt the innocence-theory and acquit.'
'presumption of innocence is not a
mere'form to be disregarded fby thd
Jury at pleasure, but it is an essential,
substantial part of the law of the land.
"The jury has n^ right to assume
the guilt and then* try to reconcile the
testimony with such theory."
