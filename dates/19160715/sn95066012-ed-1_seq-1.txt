OFFICES NOW FILLED
Democrats Have All The Vermont Ap
pointments.
St. Albans. July 10. Postmaster
Charles S. Forbes of this city has the
unique distinction of being the only
Republican in Vermont at present
holding a presidential federal office un
der a Democratic administration. In
accordance with the inexorable un
written law of both great iwlitical
parlies. Republican office holders in
this state have steadily, and in most
cases gracefully, retired from positions
of profit and trust since Wood row WU
son was inaugurated president of the
t'niied States on Mnrch 4. 191:'.
On that date President Wilson was
contronted with a condition showing
that in Vermont, as well as in other
states, the incumbents of all govern
ment Offices, with the possible excep
lion of some fourth class postmasters.
were appointees of a Republican presi
dent. I'he Jaeksoiiian theory that "to
the victors belong the spoils," was in
voked to lie put in practice to some
extent bv Democrats who desire to
serve their country, officially, at the
usual compensation fixed by law for
DUbliC Service. Hut President Wilson
adopted a policy In effect that all fed
i ral Officers Should be allowed to serve
tie f fun term of four years unless
tOOner removed on charges preferred
and proven. It should be said to tin
credit of Mr. Wilson and of all the ap
pointees holding commissions from
President T.ift, with scarcely an ex
Ceptton, that none was removed, tint
allowed to serve until their commls
sions. or terms, expired, or the office
became vacant by death.
Thus it appears the office of I'nited
States district judge, held by James
L Martin who die I in office, is now
held by Harland B. Howe; that Dis
trict Attorney Alexander Dunnett was
succeeded by Vernon A. Kullurd: that
Horace W. Bailey, I'nited States mar
thal w ho died In office, was succeeded
by Arthur P. Carpenter.
In the matter of the collectors of
customs in the districts of Vermont
and Mcinphreiiingog, held bv C H.
