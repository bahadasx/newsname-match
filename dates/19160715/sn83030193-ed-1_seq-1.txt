HIS COLLAPSE SUDDEN.
Believed to Have Been Worn
Out by Work on New York
Agency Change.
Paul Smith, thirty-one years eld,
as of the most noted men In tba
automobile business in thla country,
leaped from the window of hla room
en the tenth floor of tba Blltmore
Hotel to-day at about 10 o'clock and
wa daab ad to daath onThe sidewalk
da tba Forty-fourth Street alda of the
hotel.
Rla daatb la attributed by bla phy.
alolan and frlenda to a complete ner
Toua and mental collapse following
bla aucceaiful completion of a deal
substituting an agency for the branch
office of the Chalmers Motor Com
pany In tbta city. It Involved the.
ale by contract by Mr. Smith to the
C. T. Silver agency of $6,000,000 worth
of automobile after Mr. Stiver had
been persuaded to undertake the
agency.
While Mr. Smith's body was atUl
lying on the Forty-fourth Street aide
walk a telegram from Hugh Cbal
sears was delivered at hla room
thanking and congratulating him for
tba work on the big deal which had
ceavertad an annoying problem Into
a victory for both the manufacture
and tba pmrcbaeers of tba agency.
Mr. Smith bad bean for two years
tba Vice President and general eoles
manager of the Chalmers Motor Com
pany. It waa bis capacity for big
busl&sas on Just such a acala as this
last big transaction which caused Mr.
Chalmers to draft blm. Mr. Smith
had risen rapidly through the busy
derelopment of tba automobile bull
ae ct the last few years.

Tan years ago he was a young
physician beginning praotloe In Co

puncher on the plains and a baseball
player. Ha found a physician's life
"robbed him of all his Independence"
and want to Detroit and began over
again as a day laborer In as auto
mobile factory.
Within a few months he was Co
lumbus agent for the Goodyear Tire
and Rubber Company, His competi
tor explained Jokingly that when
Paul Smith could find no more au
temoblllsts to whom tiros could be
sold, he turned to river captains who
bought them for life preservers.
Flanders, the automobile engineer,
who bad known tho young man In De
troit, took htm up while he wan New
Tork sales manager for tho Goodyear
Company and mado him sales man
ager for the E. M. F. Company. He
was manager of sales for the Stude-
baker, Loiler and a large owner of
the Metsger Company before Chalm
era reached for him.
When Mr. cnaimers complained a
month ago that the Now York branch
business was a disadvantage to both
manufacturer and customer because
of Its division of purposes and Inter
ests Mr. Smith volunteered to
straighten out the situation.
