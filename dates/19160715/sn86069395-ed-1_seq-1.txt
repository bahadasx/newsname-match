VALEDICTORY OF DR. LARUE.
"Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gen
tlemen:
"You can never know the magni
tude of my emotions of this hour.
Surrounded by this magnificent com
pany of friends, who so lavishly be
stow upon me econmiums and fulsome
praise, my heart swells within, a
crimson tinge paints my cheek, tears
dim my eyes, thoughts crowd my
mind and clamor for utterance, with
no language adequate, with which to
clothe my response.
"If I had ever doubted your friend
ship, or ever failed to appreciate you,
this occasion brings to me a vision a
revelation and greater cause and dc-
sire to cherish your memory, because
of the exquisite pleasure this hour
brings to me.
"My life began, and py lot was cast
among youland without interruption,
my efforts have been directed by the
impulse of an honest desire, stimulat
ed by the whisperings of an inward
conscience, to render a genuine pub
lic service and thus- acquit myself and
sustain the reputation of my profes
sion.
"When called to your homes on
missions of helpfulness. I have shar
ed your anxiety, mingled my hopes
with yours, ministered to every need
with painstaking care, partaking of
your hospitality and sharing your sor
rows. HAS FOUGHT FOR HEALTH.
"With the vision of life and health
widening before the public horison,
and knowing the thoughtlessand dan
gerous habits of many friends, solici
tous anxiety has often moved me to
take decided and vigorous aciion and
make determined efforts to conserve
the public health, in the face of stub
born opposition.
"In dealing with health conditions I
have often been compelled to resort
to harsh measures against acquired
habits, because, in dealing wjth dis
ease, we must also deal with preju
dice and superstition, neither of which
can stamp out maladies, nor meet the
demands of the sick room. ,
"The timo given and the means
used in acquiring my literary and
medical education and surgical train
ing would have been in vain, if I
should fail to urgo the plain duties of
sanitation.
"For my professional conduct along
this line, I have no apology, for I have
been guided by no selfish motive, but
I by a desire to promote the public
health and the peoplo's Happiness.
SHALL RETAIN CITIZENSHIP.
"Through the generosity of Gover
nor A. 0. Stanley, and the honorablo
! board of control, I am the recipient of
' the appointment as superintendent of
the Western State Hospital at Hop
kinsville, the duties of which position
call me from among you, but I sliall
remain a citizpn of Smithland, for I
' want to continuo to be identified with
' my friends hero and throughout Liv
ingston county. :
"I am not unmindful of the pres
ence here of our distinguished guests,
who camo to partake of your genuine
hospitality and enjoy, with me, this
social hour, I feel honored by their
presence, and hope the fires kindled
hire. mav continue to warm and weld
the affections of these guests and their
entertainers, after our separation.

SHARK KILLS
TWO BATHERS
Lad Svimming in RaritanBay
and Rescuers Attacked
by Man-Eating Fish.
Mattawan, N. J., July 14. Lester
Stillwcll 12 years old, was killed by a
man-eating sWk while bathing in an
arm of Raritan bay near here. Stan-
ey Fisher, 21 years old, who went to
lis aid, was so badly injured in a
struggle with the sea monster that he
died while being taken to a Long Is-
and hospital Joseph Dunn, 12 years
old, bathing some distance away in
the same inlet, was attacked by a
shark, and one of his legs was so
badly lacerated it probably will have
to be amputated.
This is the third time within two
weeks that sharks have claimed the
ives of bathers along the New Jersey
coast. Charles E. Vansant, a youth of
Philadelphia, was killed by one off
Beach Haven, N. J., on July 2. Chas.
Bruder, of Spring Lake, N. J., was
attacked and both of his legs taken off
by a shark on July 6. He died while
men who went to his rescue were
carrying him ashore.
A dozen or mof e boys who also
were bathing in the inlet heard Still
well's screams for help. Fisher who
was standing on the bank, went to the
rescue. He had gone only a few feet
when the shark attacked him, taking
apiece out of one thigh.
In spite of his wound, Fisher caught
the boy up in his arms and had start
ed for shore when the shark renewed
the attack. Burdened as he was, Fish
er was helpless and the shark snap
ped off his leg. Fisher released his
hold on Stillwcll and himself sank be
neath the surface, unconscious.
Heedless of the danger another boy
sprang into the inlet and dragged
Fisher out. No trace of young Still
well was found and it is believed he
was devoured bythe shark.
The Dunn boy, according to per
sons who were standing on the bank
of the inlet, also was attacked soon
after poincr into the water. An older
brother and another boy went to his
rescue, iney succeccieci m driving
off the shark, but not until after the
younger Dunn's leg had been torn al
most to shreds from the knee down.
He is expected to recovered.

Silent on Great Battle.
HOLDING BACK THE NEWS.
German Paper Says The Op
erations Now On Will
Settle The War.
London, July U. There was very
little news of the "battle of Europe"
a term commonly applied to describe
the new co-ordinated entente offensive
on all fronts. But the British official
statement tonight shows that heavy
infantry and artillery fighting has been
in progress and has enabled the
British to maintain their pressure on
the Germans and advance their line
at various points.
The British forces at Mametz wood
are within 300 yards of the German
second line. The French forces are
separated only by the narrow Somme
valley from the German third line
through Peronne and Mont St. Quen
tin and both armies are doubtless
engaged in preparations for the next
attack.
Maj. Moraht in the Berliner Tage-
blatt, expresses the opinion that the
coming days will be decisive of the
issue of the whole war.
The reticence cf the Russian official
communications oi tne present mo
ment judging by precedent, indicate
the progress of some important move
ment which will only be announced
when the operations are conclude!!
The Austrian and (jerman represen
tatives show that Gen. von Bothmer
is still holding on the region of Tarno-
pol, although the two wings of the
Russian advance are forty miles be
yond Tarn jpol, which seems to show
that Gen. Bothmer feels secure in his
line of retreat. Heavy fighting con
tinues on the Stokhod line and north
west of Bucacz.
The Cologne Gazette foreshadows
the introduction in September of a
butter and fat card throughout the
empire providing for three ounces a
head each week and probably an egg
card, entitling the holder to two eggs
a week.
The most violent fighting in the
great entente allied offensive on the
eastern front where Gen. Brussiloff's
tremendous blows are being contin
ued without apparent lull or hesitation.
Temporarily at least, the Austro-Ger-mans
appear to have halted the Rus
sian advance along the Stokhod. Both
sides are reported to be hurling huge
renuurix-muuib who uiih mimuc mi uK-
gle, the prize of which is the im
mensely important strategic town of
Kve''
Further to the south, a battle of al-
most equal intensity is raging on the
the lower Stripa, where the Russians
aro striking north inan effort to crush
Gen. Bothmer and flank the entire
Austro-German line.
The Austrians admit that the Rus -
sians penetrated Gen. Bothmer's front
at somo points, out assert tney were
driven out again in counter-attacks.
Tho Russians claim to have tukon
2,000 prisonors, but made no mention
of n gain in territory.
' Bathing Unpopular.
Three sharks are believed to have
been wired off in Raritan bay,' Ob
servers say that at least half a dozen
have been seen. Terror has seized
the multitudes who have bathed at
beaches along tho New York and
New Jersey coasts and comparatively
few persons now venture into tho
water. At Asbury Park and other
New Jersey resorts, wiro nets have
been strung around the bathing areas.
News was brought In by Anthony
Lundy, captain of a fishing boat who
said his party of New York fishermen
had clubbed to death a nine foot shark
weighing 450 pounds while cruising
off Elberon, N. J.

Seeks To Break Will.
Washington, July 14. In an effort
to gain full control of the McLean mil
lions, Edward B. McLean has brought
uit in the Supreme court of the Dis-
ncbof Columbia to break the will of
' his father, the late John R. McLean,
publisher of the Washington Post and
ths Cinciannati Enquirer.
" I'oung McLean charges that at the
time his father prepared the will in
contest ho was of unsound mine.
Eiihu Root, former Secretary of State
and later Senator of New York, has
been retained by McLean to prove
this charge against his father.
Under his father's will Edward B.
McLean was given only a life interest
in the estate, which has been estimat
ed as high as $20,000,000. He was:
given no control whatsoever over the
properties, the trusteeship of which
was placed in the hands of a locai
trust company.
