ENGLISH PAID VERY
"LITTLE ATTENTION
o American Demand that Interfer
ence with the Mails Come
:'' -to an End - - :
(Associated Press)
London, July 15. Surprisingly lit
tle attention has 'been given in this
country to the American note on seiz
ures of the mails. When published in
America only brief and rather exag
gerated summaries wera sent by the
British correspondents. The note was
published in full only by the Times on
the nineteenth of June, several days
after the American papers which
printed it had arrived in England. On
Saturday the foreign office issued the
text as fan official paper for publica
tion on Tuesday, June 27th.
Almost the only important editorial
reference to the note is made by the
Economist in a late issue: It points
out that "owing to lack of informa
tion the public in this country has
failed to understand the constant ref
erences by President Wilson and by
eadmg newspapers in the , United
States to the question of 'Freedom of
the "seas."'
After noting a large part of the
note the Economist says:
"It will be seen that a good deal
of feeling has been evinced, and that
great care and discrimination are re
quired in order not only to meet the
susceptibilities of friendly neutrals,
but also to avoid the establishment of
precedents which, under different cir
cumstances, we should not tolerate
ourselves as neutrals in a future naval
war. Supposing, for example, there
were a war between Spain and Sweden
and the beligerents claimed the right
to intercept mails between London and
Paris or London and New York, and
to open all private letters, would that
pass?' The summing-up of the note
is very strong. It declares that the
rights of neutrals are as sacred as the
rights of belligerents, and must be
as strictly observed,- and concludes
'Only a radical change in the present
British and French policy, restoring
to the United States its full rights as
a neutral power, will satisfy this gov
ernment.' Fortunately we have an ar
bitration treaty with the United States
which Germany has not."

SEABOARD PEOPLE
AT THE SPRINGS
Over Six Hundred Employes of the
Florida Division Enjoying Them
selves at that Pleasant
f Spot Today
Proof that Silver Springs is one of
the most pleasant places in Florida
can be obtained from any of the near
ly seven hundred employes of the
Florida division of the Seaboard Air
Line who picnicked at that picturesque
location today. .
It had been the intention , of these
people to have a picnic at the Springs
on the fourth of July, but as it seem
ed like the government was going to
demand all the spare cars to haul
troops in on that date, it had to be
postponed.
The postponement discouraged a
number of people and it began to look
like there would not be any picnic, but
the committee in charge, Messrs. W.
W. Stanton of Jacksonville, J. L. Win
ter of Waldo and E. Y. Graves - of
Tampa, are an indomitable bunch, and
with the cheerful co-operation of Sup
erintendent Parsons, succeeded in get
ting out a good crowd and having a
most pleasant and successful' outing;
Mr. Stanton, with Mr. Smith, a re
nowned barbecuist of Jacksonville,
and other assistants, and a carload
of supplies, arrived at the Springs
yesterday afternoon, and began 1 to
make arrangements. They put on a
huge barbecue in the grove a couple
of hundred yards north of the Springs,
and made all other needful prepara
tions..- - . ".: - "
Shortly before noon today two long
trains pulled in, one from Jackson
ville and the other from Tampa,
bringing people from all along the
line. There t were not so many as
there would have been on the fourth,
but the attendance was large, 655 al
together. - v " . - t
The visitors took immediate posses
sion of the grounds, docks, springs
and boats, including the - two big
yachts and a dozen launches, which
carried large parties several miles
down Silver river. Scores were good
swimmers, and they availed them
selves to the full of the fine new bath
house and its facilities.""
Mr. and Mrs. Ed. Carmichael and
a , number of their .friends interested
themselves in the picnic and helping
the visitors to have a good time, and,
as we all know, nobody knows how
any better. - . V V
Mr. Stanton, who was tne main
squeeze, was busy looking after the
dinner, and when, about 1 o'clock, he
marshaled the host to the feast in the
gr6ve everybody was sorry he wasn't
running for governor, for they surely
would have given him a solid vote.
The dinner was excellent in quality
and bounteous in quantity, enough not
only for the railroad people, but many
visitors from Ocala and - elsewhere
who were most hospitably made wel
come.
The Seaboard folks are certainly a
good-looking bunch, ladies, gentlemen
and many pretty girls, from all the
way front way up at Fernandina to
far down at Venice.

Injunction Asked for Against
the City
APPLICAHTS ARE TRYIFIG TO
FOR WORK Oil THE HEW WATER ID ELECTRIC PLA1IT
Notice was served this morning by
Richard McConathy and II. M. Hamp
ton, as solicitors, that an injunction to
- - - ,
restrain the city from making pay
ment to Benjamin Thompson, contrac
tor for the new light and water plant
now under construction, would be ap
plied for on June 20 before 'Judge
Bullock. A bill of complaint, making
charges of misappropriation and mis
application of bond moneys, was at
the same time filed with P. H. Nugent,
clerk of the circuit court. The com
plainants are: A. A. Vandenbrock, E.
T. Spencer, Bertha L. Hogan and J.
D. Small. ; '
The bill of complaint charges that
there is a great need for the exten
sion of water mains to North Ocala.
It charges that the ordinance provid
ing for the $100,000 bond issue in
1911, of which $100,000 there is $55,-
000 yet available, did not authorize
the purchase of the old plant by the'
city and the construction of the new,
but only authorized the equipping of;
the old plant, if purchased. It isi
charged, further, that the people of
Ocala did not vote for anything but
for the buying of the old plant and j
the repairing of the same. The $75,-j
000 bond issue, it is charged, was
simply for the purpose of erecting
and equipping an .electric light sta
tion in connection with the : water
works, but not for the purpose of
building) a combined plajit. Forthe
purpose of extending the water mains
into North Ocala, it is vcharged that
an additional tax will be necessary.
if . the bond moneys are misappro
priated and misapplied. The bill, also,
makes the point that there is a con
tract with the R. D. Coles Manufac
turing company of Newnan, Ga., for
the construction of the water tower,
and that this company is not joined as
defendant, because payments to the
company are not to be made for some
time yet, and because it is impossible
to get a personal service on the cor
poration, which has no agent in this
state. . -' " '
Another injunction asked for was
not altogether unexpected, although
there was a growing belief that there
would be no further effort to hold up
the work on the new plant. The city
had already lost heavily bydelay. The
new application for an injunction
comes with a large part of the foun
dations of the light and water plant
completed. v
Subpoenas will be served on all of
the defendants mentioned in the bill
of complaint filed this morning; every
member of the present council, Mayor
Robertson, Benjamin Thompson, H. C.
Sistrunk, city clerk, and W. W. Clyatt,
city treasurer. .
The bill prays that the city be en
joined and restrained irom paying
ont any portion of the funds to Ben
jamin Thompson, which were derived
from a sale of the water works bonds,
or. the electric light bonds. A tem
porary injunction is- asked for, with
a view to making it permanent.
Frederick Hocker, city attorney,
first heard of the injunction sought
about 11 o'clock. When seen he had
not had time to look into the matter
thoroughly. Asked whether the com
plainants could be required to put up
a sufficient bond to protect the city
against. loss, Mr. Hocker said that
they could. The amount -of the bond
is determined by the court. Mr,
Hocker was not prepared to say what
steps would be taken by the city to
meet the application for the injunc
tion. He thought that this would be
decided when council meets Tuesday
night. -
. President Nash was asked if a spe
cial meeting of council would be call
ed to consider means for meeting the
injunction. He did not think a spe
cial session necessary. The regular
meeting Tuesday night he thought
would be time enough. President
Nash called attention to the fact that
the council at its last meeting pro
vided for the extension of the water
main on Magnolia street north to
Teuton's store. Mr. Nash also point
ed out that the city plans to extend
the water mains into North Ocala as
soon as possible, to complement the
J sewer mains laid in that part of the
