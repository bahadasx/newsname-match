GRAND JURY REPORT
•he Honorable Judge of tin
Nineteenth Judicial Distuut
C >uri:
Wo, I Ire grand j u roi h ot lire pai
isli of Iberia, having been in pen
mon for tin* pant week and having
finished onr labors, do hereby sub.
ruit to the con it the following re
port:
We Hud (liai the publie roads of
this pat ish are gene tally m good
condition. The model road be
tweeie»New Iberia and Jeanerette
,s badly in need of attention and
and we leeoiiiineiid to the police
jury that at the earliest possible
Mine, justified by the condition of
the finances of the parish that the
said road lie gravelled. The pies
eut roan would serve as an excel
lent f ou h d a I in.I fur the gravel,
which would make it a peiinanent
and highly satisfactory highway.
Complaint has been made to the
jury of the condition of a certain
bridge across ILijou Petit Anse,
south of the I & V K R This
bridge is repotted to the jury to be
very important fur the harvesting
of the present growing crop which
has to lie hauled across Haul ILt
you to swindles un the railroad.
We realize that the present po
lie© jury has inherited a large in
debtedness, hearing a sum of in
terest w liicliq^ ili tie a burden npol
them; but there are certain works
in the parish which on account of
the great necessity of then being
done and others due to the dangei
oy not repairing ihe bridges, that
the work will have to be done and
we trust that the jury will find
means to put the improvements in
proper condition
It has been reported to us that
he
reported to us that
the present police jury hopes to be
able to put this parish on a cash
baals This would lie a great ac
complishment on their part and if
such is accomplished it will be the
greatest service that atiy police
jury can render its parish, saving
as it will thousands of dollars not
only to the parish, but to the peo.
pie who arf forced to accept paper,
and who under present conditions
are unable to realize on said paper
or forced to lose a part of the
money earned by them.
We have inspected the Parish
Jail and find that those incarcérât
ed are not given proper bedding.
It is not humane to force one con
fined in a cell to sleep on cement
floors or with such accommoda.
Hons as are provided for the pti
soners. We have called this mat
ter to the attention of the police
jury and are satisfied that they
will improve the comforts of the
prisoners. In this matter we ate
blaming neither the present sheriff
nor the present police jury, as
both are newly inducted into of
fice.
We find that the offices and
vault of the clerk of court are be
ginning to be crowded again. The
city jail standing next to the Court
House in our opinion could be ac
qui red very cheaply and with very
little expense fitted up to accom
modate some of the records of the
Clerks office. We suggest to the
police jury that they make ar
rangements to acquire and improve
this building and make it a part of
the clet k's office.
The roofs of the court house and
the parish jail are both in bad con
dition and should be repaired at
once To permit water to drip
through the buildings is not only
inconvenient for the occupants,
bat will cause the buildings to de
bat will cause the buildings to de
teriorate
We have investigated the viola
(ions of the dipping ordinances in
this parish and have returned 135
bills. In view of the fact thaï
compulsory dipping has been sac
rion and provided for by the legis
latare, and considering the amount
of money already expanded by the
parish in fitting up and supervis.
iog dipping, as a business proposi
tion, the ordinances should by all
means be enforced. It is for the
public good, and moreover, ifMDur
people are forced to dip now, we
wt I sooner have quarantine raised
against us.
I We suggest to the police jury
that they arrange to meet com
piaiuts made to the grand jury
with reference to dipping as fol
lows:
1st. That they provide water
for the stock before they are dip
ped.
2nd That the proper level of
the solation in the vat be mam
tained so as to remove all danger
of the injury to stock.
3rd. That the vats be kept as
cieao as froseible, the manure to be
removed as often as possible.
4tb. That the approach to the
vats be either filled where there
are holes or properly draiued so
that the stock may enter thoshatc

DID HE GET THE OWL?
A venerab'e lawyer, thinking te
Gain up a boy to hin own nut on,
so as to have some one to whom In*
could safely leave a splendid prae
jtioe, which he IihiI spent years of
study and toil of building, adver
Hsed for an office hoy On the
day stated in the advertisement
theie were many young prospects
seeking the position. I hey were
all invited into the office where
chairs weie arranged for them
After all were seated the lawyer
Slated that he wanted In tell
them a little story* after which he
invited (heir questions and critic
isms
The story ran as follows:— ,i A
tanner, thinking to please his
young son, made him a present of
a shot-gun on his birthday l ire
hoy was delighted with his new
acquisition and maintained an aii
of "watching waiting" for an op
port unity to try out the gun, even
before the day set for their first
"hunt".
One evening, about feeding
time, the young Nimrod saw an
owl lly into the gable window of
the barn. With a rush he went
for his gun The owl was at,
home in the hayloft on one of the
braces of the rafteis. The gun
whh quickly raised and the boy
tired. One of the wads, used in
loading, was ignited by the burn
mg powder, and was carried into
the lott, where it set the hay on
lire. I'iie boy, appreciating what
he had done, loudly called for
help aud frantically fought the
spreading flames, lie realized,
ouly too soon, that his efforts
were futile. The Iron's father
first drove the animals out of the
bain and then directed his efforts
to saving other exposed buildings
lu carrying water to the roof, he
lost his footing aud fell; breaking
a leg and an arm. His mother,
who witnessed (he horrible scene,
fainted and had to be cared for by
neighbors "
"Now, boys, rhat is my story.
If any of you have any questions
that you would like to ask, do so
fr»ely". Tim hand of a small
freckled facer! boy, who had been
crowded to the corner of the room
u the rush for desirable seats,
was held up, his lingers popped
while waiting tor recoguitioo.
Well, Bobbie, what is your
question!" asked the lawyer.
"Did the farmer-bny git the
i*wlf" the little fellow earnestly
asked. The Incidental misfor
tunes and distress, which came to
others, did not serve to distraci
the little fellow's atteutiou from
the original quest of the farmer's
son

If that same boy were told the

into Mexico—the chase of the
bandits by Gen'l Pershing; the
fall of the two companies of the
10th Cavalry; the call of the Na
tional Guards, a hundred thon
sand strong, to the border; the
negotiations for peace and the
avoidance of war; Pershing's
march northward and the offer to
finance Mexico in the hour of her
need,—he might he expected to
ask: "Did he git Villa?"

at the vat without giving so much
trouble to the owner or driver.
We call upon law abiding oiti
zens of this parish to lend their
moral support to the enforcement
of all laws, aud owing to upposi
tion from some quarters, especially
to the enforcement of the dipping
ordinances of this parish and the
act of the General Assembly on
the subject.
We fiud conditions in this parish
in good condition; there being very
little crime aud no serious cases to
be tried. This bespeeks a satis
factory condition cf the morals ol
this parish and all citizens should
feel a pride that 1 bis par ish is so
law abiding.
W e also strongly recommcud
that the police jury inaugurate
perfect system of dragging the
public roads. This, to our mind
is the best way to maiutaiu good
roads.
We thank the Sheriff aud his
deputies and the District Attorney
for courtesies extended us.
Respectfully,
(Signed) C. F. Berard, Foreman.

Did you ever hear of a house

households are not looking for a
remedy that will really work? I.

been given special attention to
the little red ant that usually
causes more trouble thau any
other; and It art been able to kill it
with the syrup made from half a
Pound of sugar and a fortieth of
an ounce of sodium arseniie The

poison must be carefully weighed
by the druggist aud no more than
this must be added for two res.
sons: (1) It is a deadly poison
and will be more likely to be dan
gerous to animals, or persons who
get it by mistake if less diluted
(2) If any more of it is used, th<
ants defect the tests, and will not
eat it.
Professor Hasemau says tirai
the ant has a very keen sense of
taBte, and is a most contrat}

creature, refnsing to eat many of
the things usually used in trying
to get rid of him. In fact, b
finds that the little red nuisauc
eats this arsenic syrup better if ii
is put on sponges, rags, or blot
tiDg paper so it is seemingl\
harder to get than if in an opeii
dish. If the soaked sponges
rags are put into tiu or glass jars
closed up, except for a little
crack, as though put away to
avoid the au ta, they seem to
make special search for it, and
pass by open dishe H of it in favor
of the closed vessel.
Professer Hasemau recommends
(his poison especially for the lit
tie red ants, and says that the
real way to get rid of any kind of
ants whose nests can be found is
to destroy the entire colony with
bottling water, or by pouring on
carbon bisulphide, which will
choke or suffocate them if placed
so that Its poison gas can settle
down into the nest —Press Bull

U. S. MARINE.
Washington, July—Living pp
to its reputation as tire greatet-t
single factor for peace in America,
the United States Marine Corps,
with the loss of a few men killed
and wounded, has quietly and ef
fectnally quelled the latest revolt
in Santo Domingo, and. without
time lost in undue parley has
forced the rebel chieftains to lay
down their arms and return to
peaceful pursuits, according to
late advices from Monte Christi.
Unites Slates Marines now con
trol the entire island on which
Haiti and Santo Domingo are situ
afed, and that control was gained
without serious fighting or great
loss of life it is claimed,. because
of the thorough preparedness
the marines for the business
hand and their knowledge of
people and their ways.

writing of her experience with Cardui, the woman's
tonic. She says further: "Before I began to use
Cardui, my back and head would hurt so bad, I
thought the pain would kill me. I was hardly able
to do any of my housework. After taking three bottles
of Cardui, I began to feel like a now woman. I soon
gained 35 pounds, and now, I do all my housework,
as well as run a big water mill.
