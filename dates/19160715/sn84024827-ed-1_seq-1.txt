The steamer Alamo had been
standing by the collier today, hav
ing responded, to her calls when

attempted to put into pert here

ed that less damage than had been
believed was done by the hurricane

The greatest damage was to poles
and wires of telephone and telegraph !

FATE OF CREW UNKNOWN.
WASHINGTON, July 14. lp to a
late fjur tonight all efforts of the
navy wireless to ascertain whether
there had been loss of life in the
sinking of the naval collier Hector,
off Charleston, had been unavailing.
A series of calls for help from the
collier, stopping abruptly at four p. m.
gave rise to grave fears for the safety
of those ab'oard, but officials believe
there still was a possibility that they
had escaped.
Five brief messages, all indicating
that the collier was in a serious plight,
reached the navy department during
the afternoon. After the last of them
came at 4 o'cPjck saying that the ves
sel has settled to the bottom and was
breaking up, and making an urgent
appeal for help, the department was
unable to re-establish communication
with Charleston.

The first word came from the Hec

CHIHTAHCA. Mex.. July 14. Gen

Villista bandits in southern Chihuahua
is redisp'jsing bis troops preparatory
to a quick, powerful drive which, it
is hoped, will break the outlaws' pow

Trevino, military commander of the
northeast, announced tonight.
Reports Trom General Ramos, who
has established his base of operations
at Parral, said that he had the main
bandit forces practically surrounded
south jf Sombreretillo and expected
to force a light as soon as he had his
local commands disposed to his liking.
Following an inxpectjn trin to Rnsa

ments from Parral for the Rosario
garrison. General Ramos reported
that he was n.'jving these troops "with
a view to future operations" and

SAN ANTONIO, July 14. General
Tasker H. Blis3 lo'oked over the bi.

ton the assistant chief of staff who
has been sent to the border to. pre
pare a detailed rei-'jrt of the feueial
ized state troops for the secretary of
war visited the quarters of the Illinois
forces.
It is improbable that General Iiliss
will ask for the men to be paradtd aij
any point 'on the border. The informa
tion he wants will be contained In the
answers to questions regarding the'
health of the men, the sanitary con-1
ditions under which they are living, i
and the general fitness "of the troops.
General Bliss expects t'j leave rioj
day for Brownsville and there begin
an investigation of militia camps that
will lead him westward along the
border as far as Arizona. It may be
several weeks before his work is com
pleted. The number of men asking release
fi'jm service on the plea that tliey
have dependent relatives has not been
made public, but it was said today
that the requests were coming in
hundreds. From the state organiza
tions many are yet being dropped be
cause of physical defects and in some
cases the disposition jf those failin;.
to jualify is proving puzzling.
Held at this place are eight negroes.

General Ernesto Garcia, command
ing the Parral garrison, also reported
to General Trevii.'j today that all
danger of a 'miccessful new attack
upon the town by the bandits had
vanished with the arrival of General :
Ramos' troops. These, he said, have
repaired the railroad and telegraph
lines from Jimenez to Parral, which
the bandits destiOyed in several places
on their retreat.
General Trevino announced that re
ports from all other points in his dis
trict, including Tampico, indicated
quiet. He discussed also th pos
sibility of assigning tOnic of thr large
forces of the troops at his command
at garrisons in the mining centers of
the state that the mining and smelt
