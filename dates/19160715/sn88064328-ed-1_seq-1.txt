If you have a drop of red blood in your voina, yon will
experience in witnessing this prodnction a thrill such as you
have never known before. You will see the enemy approach
ing, the powerlessness of Forts and Defenses. You will see
the havoc wrought by the enemy's Howitzers, Sub marines,
Airships, by its shells, shrapnels, and bombs, you will see
the most beautiful sky line in the world in flames. You will
see New York fall. But with it all is a heart interest drama
so touching that it makes a lump rise in your throat and
makes your heart pulsate faster.
