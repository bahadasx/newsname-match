Organizes Hospitals

Colonel J. R. Kean
Colonel J. R. Kean, V. S. A., is di
rector of military relief, American Bed
Cross. It Is his duty to organise bane
hospital unlta throughout the United
States, especially near the border, to
cere for the wounded troopers who
have passed beyond the first aid
stage. He haa already organized twen
ty of these units fn'tbo larger "cities of
the country. A hospital with ample
facilities La usually chosen for a base
hospital and the physicians In it re
ceive army commissions In the event
of their being used In army hospital

ARMY CENSORSHIP
ACTIVE ON BORDER
ORDER MAY BE ISSUED THAT
MILITIAMEN ON BORDER MAY
BE STOPPED FROM COMMUNI
CATING WITH FAMILIES
EL PA80, Tex., July IS. Army cen
sors have been smitten with a peculiar
degree of Injustice, which if permitted
to flourish, will mean that news of
militiamen along the border will be
cut off from their anxiious families.
Today Major Farnswortb, command
ant at Columbus, N. M where the Sec
ond Massachusetts Infantry Is encamp
ed, ordered their correspondents with
that unit not to even place a date line
on their "stories," censure the doing of
the guardsmen, nor recount the said
"dotata."
Lieutenant Colonel Cabell, General
Pershing's chief of staff, had ordered
that "not a word" be sent out concern
ing General Peraing's preparations to
remain all summer tn Mexico.
It waa explained that the state de
partment fears to excite further wrath
of the Mexican government. Hence,
though truck trains are running night
and day to Colonia Dublan with sup
plies for an all summer stay of General
Pershing's force In Mexico, It is calcu
lated that by censorship of such activ
ities Carranxa will not learn of It, and
thus gradually come to forget that the
punitive thorn Is tn bis side.
