OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
STATE INSTITUTIONS.
Being one of. a series of 12 spe
cial articles for the Examiner,
prepared by W. li. Cochrau, mem
ber of the state board of control.
hi th« fall of 1906 a committee of
fifteen prominent citizens of the
state were appointed by Governor
Mead to investigate, consider and re
port to him on the subject of estab
lishing a penal reformatory In this
state, such institution to be created
along the lint's of the Klmira Re
formatory in New York; the purpose
of such institution was to contem
plate the classification of those con
victed of felonies, so that the insti
tution at Walla Walla will be con
tinued as a prison for the detention
of those convicted of graver crimes,
including those known as profes
sional criminals, the reformatory to
bo conducted as a place for the de
tention and reformation of that class
of offenders who are too old for com
mitment to the State Reform School
(now State Training School) and
yet are not hardened criminals, those
between the ages of sixteen and
thirty years, and for the punishment
and reformation of those who have
not been convicted of any previous
crime, and whose convictions were
for crimes of less magnitude than
murder, manslaughter, highway
robbery, etc.
In its report to (he Governor this
committee said :
"At first some members were in
clined to think that the governing of
the institution, to say nothing about
the Reformatory should be under the
State Hoard of Control, the same as
many Other state institutions, but
after n thorough consideration of
that feature of the matter, and in
view of the fact that practically all
Of the other states, who likewise
have Boards of Control, have seen fit
to inaugurate a separate Board ot
Managers for the Reformatory, it
seemed wise to us that to avoid
making the Reformatory a mere
penitentiary it should have its own
Board of Managers."
Thus the passage of the Reforma
tory Act was secured in the 1907
session of the Legislature. It had a
very strong opposition, but passed
the House on March Ist, by a vote of
55 to 28. Eight days after its adop
tion by the House the bill passed the
Senate by a vote of 28 to 9. Five
days later, March 14th, 1907, the
bill became a law.
The bill provided for the estab
lishment of the Washington State
Reformatory in Snohomish county,
and the appointment of a committee
of four to select the site. The Board
of Control were designated, after the
site was selected, to erect and equip
such building! as may be necessary
for present use. The government
and control of the institution to be
vested in a Board of Managers, to
consist of five members, not more
than three of such to belong to the
same political party, and to be ap
pointed by the governor; the mem
bers of the board to receive no .sal
ary compensation, but to be allowed
traveling expenses. The warden of
the State Penitentiary, together with
the members of the Board of Control
were to select from the inmates of
the Penitentiary, convicts between
the ages of 16 to 30 years whom they
might deem amenable to reforma
tory methods, provided that none
had been convicted of murder in the
first or second degree, and none
who had been convicted and sentenc
ed more than three times (which
was made the law for admission)
and transfer them to the State Re
formatory.
The law further provided that ev
iry sentence to the State Reforma
tory must be a general sentence to
imprisonment, and the courts of
this state cannot impose such sen
tence and fix the limit which a pris
oner shall serve, except that such im
prisonment shall not exceed tlie
maximum provided by law for B fel
ony. The length of imprisonment to
be terminated by the Board of Man
agers or by pardon of the governor.
The Board of Managers to have
power to transfer, with the consent
of the governor, to the State Peni
tentiary, any prisoner who, subs*
(luent to his committal shall be shown
to have been at the time of his con
viction more than thirty years of
age, and may also transfer any ap
parently Incorrigible prisoner whose
presence in the Reformatory appeal
to be seriously detrimental to the
well being of the institution.
The business management and the
purchase of supplies and the Mlfl "f
products and manufactures, together
with the auditing and keeping oi aU
accounts pertaining thereto shall 1)6
vested in the State Board of Control.
110,004.01 was appropriated to car
ry out the provisions of the act.
In accordance with this provision,
a commission was appointed to se
lect the site and they chose to locate
the institution one mile southwest
from Monroe on a tract of 329 acres.
The soil of practically all of the tract
is a very rich bluck loam and covers
the land to an average depth of from
IS to 24 inches. There is no better
soil in Snohomish county and this
land will raise any product grown in
this part of the state. At the time of
purchase, about 20 to 26 acres were
cleared and the site contained about
one million feet of standing timber.
In July, 1907, the Governor ap
pointed the first Board of Managers.
Temporary quarters were erected by
the Board of Control to accommo
date 50 prisoners. A brick plant
was installed, so that brick could be
made in sufficient quantities to erect
the buildings for the permanent ins
titution. In January, 1908, the
board appointed Cleon B. Roe as the
first superintendent. However, he
did not assume charge of the Insti
tution until August Ist, 1908, when
the Board of Control turned over the
institution to the Board of Managers.
At that time the buildings consisted
of a few wooden structures, which
housed thirty inmates, surrounded
by a stockade. The only other build
ings on the grounds were a small
farm house, which was to serve as a
superintendent's residence, and a
farm barn.
To the 1909 legislature, the
Hoard of Control in its report gov
erning the management of the Re
formatory, stated that the authority
ot the two boards conflicted, and re
commended that the institution be
placed under the absolute control of
one board. Nothing was done, how
ever, in making the change, but a
handsome appropriation was madu
lor the start of new buildings.
When planning for the permanent
buildings at the Reformatory, the
board considered it wisest to have a
completed institution in mind, and
outlined a building to that end, so
that when the equipment of the ins
titution was completed, it would b»
one harmonious whole, and not a
general piece of patchwork.
Again, to the 1911 legislature, the
Board of Control in its biennial re
port, recommended that the Reform
atory be placed under a one-headed
management. They stated that It
was impossible for the Board of
Control to serve satisfactorily as
business manager of this institution
while it had no control over its in
ternal needs. They stated that the
authority to contract for construc
tion and maintenance should be con
solidated In a single board, in order
to insure the most expeditious and
economic disposal of the business of
the institution. And again no relief
was granted.
To the 191U legislature, the Board
of Control again made complaint and
stated that the present joint govern
ment of the institution was extremely
unsatisfactory and perplexing. They
stated that there was no well defined
line between the duties of each
board. They stated that the provi
sion of law that the Board of Control
shall have the business management
of the institution was impossible of
clearer interpretation and the pur
chasing of supplies and passing of
accounts under such a condition of
uncertainty must inevitably lead to
confusion. Again the legislature
would make no change and Governor
Lister came to the rescue of the situ
ation by appointing on the Board of
Managers the three members of the
Board of Control, which placed the
entire management of the institution
practically under the one board.
The management of the institution,
therefore, passed to the control of
but one board in June, 1913.
A man is never sent to this Ins
titution until he has been convicted
of a felony. They do not come from
the Sunday school classes of our
state. They are sifted out by the
courts from the general community
and sent to us because they are
deemed so lawless, unruly and dan
gerous to society that they can no
longer, with safety, be at large.
Many, when they come, are depraved
and turbulent, vicious and rebel
lious, with little or no desire to do
otherwise. They are new here, and
untried. Most of them, for some
time after their arrival, would rath
er be any other place than here.
The underlying principles of the
reformatory system are simple. It
startb out by laying aside the old and
worn out idea that "once a criminal
always a criminal," and a recogni
tion of the well known fact that each
inmate Is unique unto himself and
must be treated for the particular
disease, whether It be moral, mental
or physical, that has caused him to
be out of harmony with the civilized
community. We have here a code of
laws much simpler than the penal
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
code that has been disobeyed, but
the underlying principle ia the same.
The instruction and training in the
Reformatory have two ends in view—
to teach him how to live with other
men and earn an uoneHt living.
When this Institution was estab
lished, the general scope and pur
pose of its work was little known to
the general public and this lack of
Information the courts themselves
shared. The law contemplates that
sentences to the Reformatory should
be confined to first offenders between
the ages of sixteen to thirty years,
and not even these offenders, if In
the judgment of the court, they are
not amenable to reformatory meth
ods. Many men have been sent here
by courts, who were without ques
tion far paHt the age of thirty, al
though they did not claim to be so.
Also many were sent here, who after
arriving, were found to be many
time offenders. This necessitates
the board making transfer to the
penitentiary. The discipline of the
institution was made more difficult
while these men were held at the Re
formatory, the institution suffered
by reason of their evil Influence on
the rest of the population, besides
causing the state additional expense
that might well have been avoided.
However, we now desire to acknowl
edge the hearty co-operation by prac
tically all of the courts of the state,
and, except in B few instances, they
are using discretion and judgment
in sentencing men to the Reforma
tory, and exercising greater care lo
ascertain whether the convict has a
previous criminal record, There i»
still a large scope of improvement
that can be made by the courts to
aid in a better administration of the
institution.
It would be a most wholesome
thing if the state made It compulsory
for every judge who handles the
criminal calendar of his county to
visit at least once early In the term
of his office each penal and reforma
tory institution of the state, so that
he might know the different condi
tions that would best suit the life of
the particular Individual sentenced
by him, for it must be conceded that
what is best for the convicted offend
er is best for the state.
The actual tangible assets that wo
have produced for the state exceed
in value the total appropriations
made by the legislature. This, tak
en in connection with the earnings
of the men who have gone out from
the restoration to citizenship and to
useful walks of life of so largo a
percentage of these men, is sufficient
justification for the existence of (his
institution. Broken homes have
been restored, family ties cemented,
young men set straight, and the
good that has been accomplished in
the lives of these fellows can only
faintly be described. There Is a
pride existing among the Inmates to
"make good," and this helps every
man In the Institution. The men
who make good never advertise to
the world that they are graduates of
the Reformatory; It is only those
who fail of whom the world hears.
Many of the men now here and on
parole are looking upon the institu
tion as truly "The I'nlversity of An
other Chance."
We take pardonable pride in the
high character of the men who are
at the head of every department.
This has been accomplished by mak
ing efficiency the test of continued
employment. No man who is not
even-tempered, self-controlled, clean
of speech, straight-forward, patient
and fearless can hold a position long
at the Reformatory. As to the moral
atmosphere of the institution, no
citizen can visit It without being Im
pressed with the good work that is
being done and the excellent internal
management. No inmate 1b paroled
until a position with a good salary Is
awaiting him. A part of the duties
of the chief parole officer In to find
positions, as they go about the state,
with men sufficiently Interested In
aiding young men who are trying to
get on their feet. Sometimes we
lack positions in particular localities
In order to do the best In certain
special cases. Whenever possible,
we have tried to get a paroled in
mate a position In a community
away from that from which he came,
no a* to get him into new associa
tions. 1 desire to take this oppor
tunity to appeal to the people of
the state, who have need for young
men to do most any kind of work
of an honorable character, to Hie
theli* applications with the parole
officer or superintendent of this Ins
titution. Keeping out of jail Is not
all that is expected or required of
men on parole —they must make an
honest living and assist others who
are dependent upon them for sup
port; Insofar as It is possible, they
must make good" any low, injury or
