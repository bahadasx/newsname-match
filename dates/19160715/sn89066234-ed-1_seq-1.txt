SCOTT COUNTY KICKER
Vol. XV BENTON, MO., JULY 15. 1916. No. 20.
THE FARM ADVISER.
Since we Must Pay Him, Why Not
Give Him a Fair Chance to Show
What He Can Do.-Co-Operate.
Let it be remembered that the
KJoker was the FIRST and OXLY
piper to advocate a farm advis
er for Scott county! and i am not
vet read.) to any it was a mis
take. Hut 1 did not take fully
Into consideration the unfavora
ble condition! that exist here
Farming if a business just the
same !it merchandising or rail
loading. Its success defends on
getting the greatest results from
the least expenditure of energy
ami money, in other words, eve
ry edge must be made to cut,
The farmer cannot remain sta
tionary, i he successful he
must keep up with the progress
of the times.
At present farming pays less
than Blmoat any other kind of
useful labor. A recent report
from the government agricultur
al department tells us that when
interest on the land value and
saulnment u figured, only about
ir oer cent of the farmei
beat
the same, while tin
remainder
fall ubout $800 ier year short
on nn average. That these tin
ures arc not far Wrorig Is proven
h.v the rapid Increase In tenantry.
Home-owners are becoming ten
ants, And the young? For them
there is little hope outside the
rank sof tenants None can buy
ii farm and pay fur it from his
labor Jt Is a difficult to pn.
Interest as rent.
The poltltcians and their organs
tell you that the farmer is the
"backbone of tie nation." That i
truc And th e powers that be
lie ,o, perhaps too late, discovered
that they have broken the "back
bone." Therefore the nation, the
gjatc, the higher schools and the
lailroads have all set out to re
set anil patch up this back-bone.
The surest and only cure is for
the parasites to net off the farm
er's back, But they are not wil
ling to do that, So they pre
scribe remedies b, which they
hoi to keep the patient coins
for a while longer, and one of
these remedies Is the farm ad
v Iser.
And
ubout
while I probably know less
farming than anyone else,
and
v iser
Ince they must pay the ad-
anyway, it is my opinion
that the farmers should use mm
to the limit and see wlmt he can
do for them. He can do nothing
w Itho it their co-operation,
In Cape county, I am told, the
farmers are well pleased with
thru- adviser, But conditions
there and here are ipiite differ
ent The farmers up there are
largely home-owners, The land
lords don't want hills that wash
Thr tenants wont keep up the
washes, Hence the landlord
hasn't got L'ape county
Here we have two very distinct
evils that interfere with the farm
adviser. The purpose uf the farm
adviser is to Increase production
by modern or scientific methods
That this can bo done there is
not the slightest doubt, in Eu
rope the population is much more
dense than here, and he win. owns
a ten acre farm Is fortunate.
But he gets more off of it than
we get off a forty acre farm.
That is called intensive farming.
It is this increase in production
the farm adviser is presumed to
work toward,
But in this county thre are
two stumbling blocks which, I
think, Mr. Dear will admit if he
is 'not afraid to. One is tenantry.
This exists all over the south half
Of the county from the Mississippi
to Little River. It covers the
level laud. To increase the pro
duet would not help the tenant
The more he raises the more the
landlord will demand in rent
However, the landlords claim
' r that it would increase land vaue
But that would only make condi
tions more hopeless. Hence the
tenant farmer may be excused
for his lack of interest In Increas
ed productions and higher land
values.
The other stumbling block is in
hills. These farmers are mostly
home-owners, yet many of them
are mortgaged. They are an in
dustrious lot, and by living econo
mically, and by the help of the
women and children In the fields,
the keep their heads above wat
er by denying themselves almost
every luxury.
Twenty years ago there was
not a piano in that community,
and 1 doubt if there was a
screen door, But conditions are
changing even there, and many
are beginning to desert the dark
ness of the cave for the light or
the 20th century,
If the Introduction of a farm
adviser means anything, it means
the application of science to
farming or scientific farming.
Science is bnsed on established
and demonstabla facts. No guess
work or superstition about it.
In dealing with animal and
plant life, which concerns the
farm, science rests upon evolution
Plants arc male nnd female and
breed the name as animals or hu
mans. While science is nothing
more than plain, common sence.
vet to understand it requires a
FREE MINI).' It will not mix
with ghost Stories and miracles.
It recognizes ns truth only that
which can bo proved So long as
n matter is in doubt. U is not a
sci( ntific fact.
in the community of winch i
speak the education and training
of the masses has been just the
opposite, While their education
was purposely and designedly
very limited, .vet the little fhat
the people got was of a kind that
raised them to shun and disbe
lieve science, "What always has
been always will be" is the foun
dation of such education, and has
nothing behind it but BELIEF.
Just wh.v a priest should favor
the oise of a farm adviser 1 do
not understand unless he has
greater concern In his land-holdings
than in his religion,
Therefore It seems to me the
best thing to do would be to take
charge of the farm adviser and
is: him to the limit. Give him u
chance to do his best The for
mation of farm bureaus has be
gun, .loin them. It will give you
a chance to mix with your neigh
bors nnd exchange ideas The
farm adviser vviii meet with you.
4Jje llini Close attention. Ask
questions, and keep on asking un
til what you want to know is
clear in your head He is your
teacher. Use him,
Then, at the end of another
three year term, you will know
whether or not you have been
benefitted and can act Intelli
gently You will be organised,
Vnd if you are still of the opinion
that there is nothing to
a win be In a i osltlon to
lectively and effectively.
The Kicker's position
it. you
set col
ln this
matter ha not been against a
farm adviser. My purpose was to
how you how little the masses
have to do with public affairs
There are about 4..".U() voters in
the county, yet the less than 50
men who set out to re-emply the
farm adviser can and do "put
over "anything they undertake
regardless of the remaining 4.
4"() I wanted you to take n
tlce how "the people" rule,
The reason they can do this Is
because they know what they
want, are few In number, andean
quickly organize. They have a
common interest and work to it
The workers also have a com
mon interest. But only in a
hazy way do they understand
They are many In numbers, dis
organised and. therefore, incapa
ble of any unity Of action That
is why they are politically and
eeoa, unieall.v helpless.

The public should know that
the Interstate Commerce Com
mission only very recently and
on two different occasions, have
reported at some length and in
considerable detail upon this very
luestlon, Its reports comprehend
two wide spread investigations
since 1U10 and me the nsiit of
attemps on the part of the rail
roads to make use oi Increases
In wages to Induce the Commis
sion to gie its consent to In
or eases In freight rates
The whole subject of wages was
gone Into by the commission with
m ich care and In great detail
The railways were f illy repre
sented by counsel and large num
bers of witnesses testified In their
behalf

iniormawon.
Alter a full hearing of the in -
test I gat iotl upon a I the facts
and circumstances, the Commis
sion held that there was no evi
dence before it which established
the necessity for higher rates
tnd again in 1014 the same
elaborate and thorough Investi
gation into the subject of wages
as having a bearing on the nee
eslty for Increased rate was
held
This federal tribunal said, "it
is interesting to note that not-1
withstanding, wages constitute a
large part of the Transportation
expense, this item of expense has
shown a relatively Miiall advance
a compared with other groups."
The Commission called atten
tion to the fact that efficiency of
operation and management are
the most Important things In the
reduction of operating expenses,
and. as an illustration, the Com
mission cited the statement of
the General Superintendent of
Motive Power of the Pennsylva
nia Railroad who lessened Sthe
cost of building locomotives be
tween 1908 and 1018, although
the rate of wages Increased near
ly 4J per cent.
The official utterances of the
Interstate Commerce Commission
answered authorlttvely questions
raised by the railroads in their
opposition to tiie present move
ment of the Railway Brother
hoods for an eight-hour w ork day
for employes In freight train ser
vice. These questions have been rais
ed by the railroads and, by the
roads through the Chamber of
.'oinmerce solely to confuse and
perplex the public jnind and In an
indoavor to prevent the Ameri
can people from securing a clear
perspective of the social and
economical Significance of the es
tablishment of a shorter work
" I i i v . for some 850,000 train em
ployes. Railroad officials well know
that the Interstate commerce
Commission has no power to fix
the rate of wages after an in-
vestlgatlon of the subject and
the whole controversy would, aft
er an investigation, be in the
same condition as it is at the
present moment.
Should however, the Interstate
Commerce Commission recommend
the granting of the demands of
the employes, the Commission
automatically be held responsi
ble for any increase in operating
expense s resulting from the
granting of the demands; there
fore would be compelled to as
sent to nn Increased freight rate
which is perhaps the very thing
that the railroads are trying to
secure out of the controversy.
DO IT YOURSELF.
No reform, moral or Intellectml,
ever came from the upper classes
of society. Each and all came
from the protest of the marty
and the victim. The emancipa

ple themselves. Wendell Phillips.

MONEY MASTERS MAN.
Robert G. Ingersoll.
There is not a man in the city
of New York with genius enough.
i with brains enough, to own five
millions of dollars. Why? The
money will own him. He becomes
a key to a safe. That money will
get him up at daylight; that
money will separate him from his
friends; that money will fill his
heart with fear; that money will
rob his days of sunshine and his
nights of pleasant dreams. He
cannot own it. He becomes the
property of that money. And he
goes right on making more.
Won tfor? He does not know. It
becomes a kind of Insanity.
