WASHINGTON. Jury 14. Demo

tomorrow night to consider further
the legislative program for the re

conferees have been unable to agree
on what measures should be disposer
of before adjournment.
At a Joint conference with the

shipping and corrupt practices bills.
There was no agreement, however, on

how soon an adjournment was
reached was entirely within the hands
of tho Democrats and that tho H

The house is expected to complete
the entire legislative program sug

If He Would I.Ike to Hear
Progressives.
WASHINGTON, July 14. In reply
to a letter from J. C. I'arker, a Phil
adelphia magazine editor, asking If
hi would accept the leadership of
Progressives of all parties. President

ho had no Jealousy of independent
political organizations, but believed
the Democratic party represented a
larger part of the progressive power
and thought of the country than any
other party.
The president wrote:
"In answer to questions contained
in your letter 1 will say that for my
part, 1 have no Jealousy whatever of
independent organizations Intended to
keep the independent voters of the
country reminded of their obligations
and fully informed as to parties and
of the conditions under which their
votes are being solicited.
"For myself 1 sincerely desire, and
havo tried to deserve, the support of
all progressive, forward-looking men.
1 believe, and I think that recent ex
perience has confirmed the belief that
the Democratic party represents a
larger part of the progressive power
and thought of the country than any
other party and that it can lie mado
the instrument and is being made the
instrument of leadership in tho direc
tion which all men who love Justice
and progress must wish to take.
"It is for that reason that I am
proud to be its nominee and to have
tho opportunity to lead it."

charitable work the people of Tulsa, noted for their generosity, ever
accomplished," said Mr. Welch yesterday. He is placing the con
tributions in a separate fund and the money will be used for no
other purpose than furnishing milk and ice to babies and poor fam
ilies. "We will need three or four hundred dollars more to tide us
through the heated term," said the humane agent, "and I feel sure
that we will get it. Judging from the hearty response to the appeal
in the past two days."
All contributions should be sent to the milk and ice fund, in

With no sign of rain Tulsa sweltered
through another day with a blistering
sun looking down from a clear sky,
but the record established Thursday
w:us not broken and held steady
throughout the afternoon at 102 de

hold the heat that some themometers
registered as high as 110 d eg res
shortly after the nouu hour.
It is a noticeable fact tli.it the

the few women shoppers who find it
necessary to venture out in the after

The extended heat wave Is showing

The forecast is for continued high
temperatures but no mention of rain
is to be found.

the Illinois forces. The formal In
spection of troops was held and it is
improbable that General bliss will auk
for the men to be paraded at any
point on the border. The Information
he wants will be contained in the
answers to questions regarding th
health of the men, the sanitary condi
tions under which they are living and
the general fitness of tho individual
and of the organizations for active
field service.
General Bliss expects to leave Mon
day for ltrownsvllle and there begin
an Investigation of militia camps that
will lead him westward along the
border as far as Arizona. It may
be several weeks before his work is
completed.
Many Want Itelea.se.
The number of men asking release
from service on the plea that they
have dependent relatives has not been
made public, buf It wu said today that
requests weTe coming in hundreds, but
not in thousands.
From the state organizations many
are yet being dropped because of
physical defects and in some case
the disposition of those failing to
qualify is rovlng puzzling. Held at
the hospital here there are eight
negroes. They came here as mem
bers of the Kighlh Illinois, a negrn
regiment. They were not mustered
in at Springfield and the medical ex
aminer here rejected them. Army
officers are studying military law and
precedent for some indication as to
who shall pay their board and then
