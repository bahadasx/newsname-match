Fear Large Loss of Life.
Washington, July 14.—Up to late
tonight all efforts of the navy wire
legs to ascertain whether there had
bgen loss of life in the sinking of the
navy collier Hector, had been unavail­
ing. A series of calls for help from
the. Hector, stopping abruptly at 4 p:
m, gave rise to fear 'as to tile siftetjy
of, those on board
As soon as the first call for help re­
lated by the Charleston navy yard
wireless reached the department, the
big station at Arlington sent broad­
cast an appeal asking any vessel near
the Hector to go to her assistance.
After the last'report had been receiv­
ed,1 Secretary Daniels went to the de­
partment and supplemented the ef­
forts of the radio officials by trying
to''reach Charleston by telephone. No
soft of communication, however, was
established. The Hector* built in
1908, was one of the first of the new
type of navy fuel vessels to be com­
pleted.
Fear Fpr Destroyer Terry.
Some concern was expressed by
navy officials tonight for the safety

Charleston when the storm broke, In

WHEN PEACE DOES
Mexico City, July 14.—General Car
ranza, in an interview today, said that
the status of the negotiations with
Washington was very satisfactory,
owing to the good will of each other
by the United States and Mexico.
"Thanks to this feeling of good
will," the first chief continued. "We
will be able to avoid war. War is
something I do not desire, but if
there were no other remedy for the
f.tuation, I v/uitld enter upon it."
General Cairanea, however, refused
to discuss the situation as it relates
to the possible action of President
Wilson, or of the Latin-American na­
tions, which offered to mediate in the

Mexico. WitMn a short time the

Medical Experts Discuss Epi­
demic of Infantile
Paralysis
iNew York, July 14.—Medical ex­
perts battling against the epidemic of
infantile paralysis, which has cost 342
lives in this city, expressed divergent
views today upon the efficiency of in­
jections of adrenalin in the spine as
a remedy for the disease, recommend­
ed by S. J. Meitzer of the Rockefeller
institute.
Health Commissioner Emerson an­
nounced tonight that physicians who
inject adrenalin must do so on their
own responsibility. Only after hun­
dreds ot" such cases had been treated
and the remedy be determined, could
the injection be given approval.
One case was reported from New­
ark, N. J., West New York, N. J., and
one in Hoboken.
INFANTILE PARALYSIS MAY
HAVE CAUSED CHILD'S DEATH
The death of a child of Jack Camp­
bell, Morton county, may have been
due to infantile paralysis. Dr. P. E.
Bunting, member of the county board
of health, declares that it was, while
the physician who treated the case
claims it was not.

When the North Dakota regiment
leaves for the border it will be per­

take the field at once and prosecute
a vigorous campaign. Practically all
of the officers have seen scrvice in
the Spanish-American war.
Col. Frank P. Allen of the North
Dakota quartermaster corps and
United States disbursing officer, has
gathered at Bismarck U4 sleepers in
which the hoys will travel, three in a
section, two in the lower berth and
one in the upper. There are only 15
specially fitted cook cars in service
and one of these has been sent, here,
'besides four baggage cars equipped
with ranges.
Plenty of Food.
The boys are going to have plenty
of food. They will not be any danger
of a repetition of the incident in
Cleveland, O., where New York troops
raided stores and commission houses,
asserting that they had been without
food for thirty-six hours.
Government officials and the sol­
diers prefer tourist cars to travel in,
but the railroads could not furnish
enough of them therefore, they
quickly converted some Pullman
sleepers into tourists and all was well.
The engines which will haul the
three specials which will carry the
troops to the border have not yet
been ordered. It will take seven hours
to get them here.

the Cfeftter of

Washington, July 14.—The informal
negotiations for'the ^settlement of the
issues between the United States and
General Carranza arc understood-
4o
have advanced a long step today,
when Acting Secretary Polk and Mr.
Arredondo held their first conference
since General Carranza's proposal for
a diplomatic adjustment was receiv­
ed.
Both declined lo say what matters
were under discussion, but there
wero indications that the conversa­
tion had passed into the definite
stage.
The commission's plan for settling
differences between the two countries
is provided for in the treaty of 1S48.
Unofficial advices from Mexico City
have indicated that General Carran­
za favored resort to it in the present
case.
President Discusses Question.
President Wilson discussed the
question with some of his-advisers to.
day, and the fact that no interruption
of the Palk-Arredondo conference re
suited,—.was, ,ta\4en. as an indication
that the, president was satisfied With
the trend of the negotiations^"

General Carranza's note proposing
a diplomatic settlement narrowed the
issues to two specific points, the an­
xiety of the United States for protec­
tion of its border and the feeling of
the de facto government that the
presence of troops in Mexico menace
friendly relations.
Secretary Lansing's report did not
go into the particulars of the question
lo be negotiated.
Mr. Arredondo issued a statement
tonight warning against sensational
stories published thorughout this
country by those desiring interven­
tion.

Washington, July 14.—John Ilesson
Clarke, a federal district judge at
Cleveland, O., was nominated by Pres­
ident Wilson today as an associate
justice of the supreme court to fill
the vacancy caused by the resigna­
tion of Charles Evan Hughes, to ac­

nomination of Mr. Clarke as a district,
judge, after an investigation into
charges that his services as counsel
for a railroad might be Injurious to
his services on the bench had been

Strategic Importance. I
The strategic importance of t!fe
British successes is marked by t{fe
straightening of their line* in.
formity with those
who had hitherto advanced
greater speed than their allies.'.
brevity of the preliminary- bombard­
ments, coupled with the statement of
press correspondents at the front that
the British losses were c6mparatl7elr
small, lend support to unofficial
ments that the German second lin«
was less strongly fortified than their
first defenses.
On French Portion.
On the French portion of the Som­
me front, no action of importance was
recorded, but in the French' official
statement for Friday, it was announc­
ed that the bombardment of German
positions on the Belgian front had
reached a point of the greatest in­
tensity. This announcement receiv­
ed additional significance as, for more
than a week, the Belgians have re­
ported a persistent and destructive
•bombardment directed against the
German fortifications. These an­
nouncements were similar to thoso
made by the British, preceding the
opening of their great offensive, and
they possibly indicate that another
big forward movement by the Entente
Allies may be attempted, at the ex­
treme western end of the battle line.
On Verdun Front.
Another point of significance in th»
day's war reports is that the only
action reported on the Verdun front
were assaults made by the French.
These assaults were noted in the
German official statement, which
made no claims of any German of­
fensive action.
On the Russian front, the great
battle of the Stokhod ts still raging,
with the issue remaining in the bal­
ance. The most important news from
the Russian side is in regard to the
operation in the Caucasus. The Grand
Duke Nicholas reports continuous
Bagdad in jeopardy.
