CONNERY
Office Holding Record of Family in State,
County and City Arouses Public In-
terest in "Fire Appliances'
There are citizens who believe that
it Is contrary to Kootl public policy In
a free country to put too many ot the
public ofllces in ono community In
the possession of members of a single
family.
The threats made by members of
tho Connery Gnng to put The Eaglo
out of business Impelled this news
paper to ferret out Just what grasp
tho Connorys have on public affairs.
The result is startling and of In
terest to taxpayers, voters and the
public generally.
No wonder somo of this gang ot
public payroll ornaments bcllovo that
they can use tho United States Gov
ernment In their business.
They ovldently have found tho
State of Illinois,
County of Cook and
City ot Chicago
Very profitable and easily worked
attachments to tho family possessions.
Democrats in Chicago are wonder
ing why all of the public Jobs aro not
given to Connery's.
l may be due to the fact that there
aro not enough Connorys to go around.
Connery s First I
What a noblo family motto that Is
to be sure.
And often has the Democratic party
fallen for the Connorys and their welP
known hankering for good things.
"State Street Store" Blockl as you
may have heard htm referred to, a
partner ot John T. Connery In the coal
business, Is a member of tho Board
ot Review.
William J. Connery, nephew of John
T. Connery, holds tho nlco-salarled
Job of Secretary of Reviewer Dlockl.
Partner Dlockl will run for re-election
next year, so preparo your bal
lots. Good stories ot city contracts and
of other contracts In which tho Con
nery connections wero alleged to have
been Interested aro not so far forgot
ten that the public Interest in them
ever wholly died out.
There was a number of talented
Democratic leaders who hold ofllco or
contracts under the Dusse BUSINESS
administration.
We have referred to some of theso
worthies before as our flies will at
test. But talking of the Busse BUSINESS
administration, Democrats do not for
get the party treason which brought
it about.
Democrats do not forgot the dose
that some members ot tho Connery
gang gave Mayor Dunne in 1007 when
he was running for re-election.
Although looked upon by many in
the light ot tho Royal Family ot tho
Democratlo party, entitled to most,
If not to all, ot the Jobs in its gift,
the Connory's aro alleged to havo
given such great support to Busse
and to havo worked so hard ot defeat
Dunne that Bubso's gratltudo was
great.
When John W. Ralney, always a
good Democrat and an able man, was
running for Clerk ot the Circuit Court
in 1012, tho Connery outfit fought
him at tho polls in favor ot Josoph
E. Bldwlll, Jr., a Republican.
Whon Robert M. Sweltzor was run
ning for tho Democratic nomination
for Mayor In 1015, tho Connorys saw
another chance to put a mombor of tho
family in that ofllco and they trotted
out Francis D. Connery, then City
Clerk and now Comptroller ot tho
Sanitary District ot Chicago.
But tho Democratlo stomach was
showing signs of balking at an ovor
diet ot Connory and the noblo Francis
D, was sent back to tho payroll to
wait for anothor chance.
Sweltzor got the nomination and It
Is said that the Connery following
did not forglvo him tor crowding out
ono of tho princes of the blood and
wero not over-enthuslastle for Swelt
zer's election to say the least.
This year the Connery's are not
asking for much.
It Is reported that Joseph B. Bid
will, Jr., son-in-law of John T. Con
nery will not seek Republican nomi
nation for Clerk of the Circuit Court
against John W. Ralney, the present
FOUNDED 1889

Josoph, F. Connory, a brother of
John T. Connery and a brother of

John T. Connery and Francis D. Con

and uncle-ln-law of Joseph E. Bldwell,

Joseph M. Connery, cousin of Fran

Joseph F. Connery, John T. Connery
and Michael M. Connery has been

nation for Board of Review this year.
State, Street .JJlocki, the., business
partner of John T. Connery, will not

So William J. Connery, nephew of

Michael M. Connory will retain his

But by noxt year a tow more of
flces may be created for a few moro

him from getting lonesome
Connery first the rest nowhore.

atesBigCounty Ticket Without a German
Name Say Germans Have No Chance.
The Democrats have nominated a
ticket without a German by birth or
descent on It.
A Connery Is on It of course, for
ono of the best Jobs.
Not a man on tho ticket had an
American grandfather, the only out
going county olllclal who had an
American grandfather, County Sur
veyor George C. Waterman, was not
renominated.
No Germans were wanted. Somo
ot tho leaders were Interviewed by
The Tribune with tho following re
sults: Ross C. Hall, representing tho
country towns, said:
"Our ticket will be unbeatable In
November after we havo slated a
few Poles for the Municipal court.
Tho city hall forces havo put up a
ticket of Swedes and Germans.
We've named n ticket of Irish and
Poles. How can we lose?"
There isn't a single Gorman on the
entire Sullivan slato, tho talk among
tho Blatemakors being that no Ger
man had a chance In Cook County
this fall.

THREE GOOD MEN FOR
THE SANITARY BOARD
The nomination of Thomas M. Sul
11 an for President of the Sanitary
District of Chicago und of James A.
Long and Joseph Rushkcwicz for
Trustees of the Sanitary District could
not be improved upon. They should
be elected, as all ot them have been
tried In public ofllco and havo proven
themselves to be good public servants.

Tho loud mouthed threats of tho
Connery gang of Public Ofllco Holders
to "put tho Chicago Englo out of tho
malls and out of business" for daring
to criticize tho public nets of somo of
Its members are arousing public at
tention. Tho people havo known right along
that tho Connorys wero credited with
holding many public Jobs In Chicago.
Tho pcoplo have known right along
that tho Connerys wero In tho coal
business to mnko money.
They have known right along that
a member of tho Connery coal Arm
Is a member ot tho Board ot Rovlow.
They havo known right along this
official's private secretary was a Con
nery. They havo known right along that
tho Attorney General's Ofllco Investi
gates matters connected with public
offices.
They have known right along that
tho Olllclal Investigator of tho Illinois
Attorney General's Ofllco Is a Con
nery. They have known right nlong that
a city clerk somo ot whoso methods
tho present city clerk did not follow
was a Connery.
They havo known right along that
tho man who passes on tho bills of
Contractors for tho Sanitary District
of Chicago is a Connery tho Comp
troller of tho District.
They have known right along that
tho rather Important Job ot State Bank
Examiner is held by n Connery.
They havo known right along that
most ot tho public offices In Cook
County aro honeycombed with Con
nerys. They know that tho Recorder ot
Deeds, who runs again this year,
whoso ofllco contains several Con
norys, Is a Connery.
Now they know that tho Connery
gang feels so sure of Its grip on tho
public that It Is heard threatening to
uso the Federal Government to silence
criticism of Its methods,
If this isn't Bosslsm in Its worst
form, what Is?
