ANNUAL CONVENTION
Of the Mason t'oonty Knndaj Nrhoal
Association Held In neernwnon
Park Yesterday New fnaaty
President Elected.
The Mason County Sunday School
Association held Its annual conven
tion In Beechwood Park yesterday
from 9 o'clock a. m. until 4 o'clock p.
m. Quite a number were present and
a very enthusiastic meeting; was held.
Those present were all Interested in
the work and all were willing to aid
the Association In any way possible.
Tho entire program went off very
nicely except for the absence of Mr.
V. J. Vaughn, the State Field Worker
of Sunday Schools. His placo on the
program was taken by Mr. (leorgo A.
Joplln, the State Secretary. Mtb.
Laura Osborne of Dover, who was to
have sung a solo In the morning ses
sion was also unable to be present.
The morning session was opened by
a devotional service conducted by
Rev. Felta of the Forest Avenue
Church of thla city. The secretary ot
the association then read the minutes
of the last meeting which were adopt
ed by the convention. The resolutions
committee was appointed consisting of
Mr. W. W. Ball, Prof. Dlx, Miss Oer
trudc Raugh and Mrs. Joe Wells. The
nomination committee was Mrs
Moody. Miss Mary WoouVMr. Sttthi and
Mr. Felta.
Mr. Joplln made the opening ad
dress of the day. His Btibject. "Mak
ing the Opening Exercises Count in
the Religious Development of the
Child." His treatment of the subject
was good and he brought out some
excellent points In his talk. "Open
the exercises quiet and worshipful
said Mr. Joplin. Have a dominent
thought running through the whole ex
ercises. Never read the lesson. You
Infer that the students have not stud
ied It. Have the whole opening a
preparedness to receive the lesson in
the class room." Mr. Joplln also urged
that all Sunday Schools observe the
special days.
In the absence of Mrs. Tuggle, Mrs
H. C. Barnes of this city sang very
beautifully, "I'm a Pilgrim."
Rev. H. Kerr Taylor gave an address
"The Greatness of the Sunday School
Teacher's Mission." In his address he
brought out the fact that the Sunday
Sotiool lesson of today Is the code of
morals of tomorrow. The teacher
should be 'an enthusiastic workct
There should go out to the people a
spirit of love. He should know the
life of the child. In teaching us the
Bible for material and no teacher
bhould teach without he is familiar
with the book of Romans. He ought
to be fitted with the desire to win a
pupil to Christ for love winning is the
chief aim.
Rev. Emil Bauermau of Flemings
burg gave the address "The Sunday
School at Its Best." His talk was
somewhat different from the rest of
the speakers. He made the statement
that the Sunday School is shabby
when compared with the public school
In equipment. There should be an
idea of methods In all schools before
the school will attain its highest ef
ficiency. One of the greatest defects
of the Sunday School is that the text
book is not understood. He closed
with the exhortation to change the
plans whenever best.
The convention then closed until
1:30 and dinner was served by the
ladles. During thla time the commit
tees met and discussed their work.
The afternoon session opened by a
devotional service lead by the chair
man, Miss Mary Wilson.
Prof. Dix of Maysllck made the
opening address of the session. H!s
subject was "The Preparation and
Presentation of the Lesson." Hla talk
was masterly and full of good thought.
Prof. Dlx showed by hla speech that
he Is an excellent Sunday School
worker, as he seemed very full of his
subject.
Miss Martha LstJ (Jrlgsby of Texas
sang u very beautiful solo appropriate
to the occasion. Miss Qrigsby has u
wonderful voice and the Association
was Indeed Indebted to her for sing-log.
The main speaker of the day was
Dr. W. C. Condlt of Ashland. Ky . who
gave bis famous address, "The Taber
nacle". Dr. Condlt usod a real taber
nacle iu Illustrating hla lecture and
much benefit was derived from It. He

A Fine Handkerchief Is One of
the Marks of a Gentlewoman
She may economize elsewhere, but not on the sheerness
and fineness of the little square of linen in her pocket. And
she does not need to economize on this when 25c buys such
handkerchiefs as we sell. As much care and thought go into
them as into the costliest article in this store. One may even
go below 25c and at 10c and 15c be sure of getting handker
chiefs that will be a pleasure to the eye and the touch.
