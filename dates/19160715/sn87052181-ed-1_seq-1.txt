anizatton Is- $100.
A student union for tho University
of Missouri was first discussed last

University ot Michigan and other
places, where all students may gath
er and where student actlvlt'es will
take place.
.'art of the money raised will b-3
used at onco to carry on nn educa
tional campaign, chiefly by means of
literature, to explain to tho alumni the
purpose of the union. Part of the
funds will also be used In renting tem
porary quarters near the campus for
u temporary student union building.
Tho board als.0 fixed the annual
dues for active members at $3 and
passed a motion that tho parmancnt
homo ot tho union be a clubhouse and
business headquarters for men.
James P. Jamison, the university

building, based on the Pennsylvania
plan, but modlfled to suit Missouri
needs.

ALL WANT ROCK ROADS NOW
Four Western Missouri Counties
Would Follow Example Set by
Clay In Voting Bonds.
Four more Mlsouri counties in tho
northwestern nart of the state nro
planning to folow the example of Clay
county and vote for, permanent roads.
"Slnco Clay county passed tho Hi
million dollar bond Issue for perma
neno roads," Judge J. M Lowe 'said
recently, "I havo been informed by
road boosters of Platte and Clinton
counties that they nro going to ur
rango a special election as soon as pos
sible. "Among tho citizens of Platte coun
ty, who are pushing'' th" movement,
nre: J. Ed Bohart, Rnk'lgh Morgan,
Charles E. Jones, Ttlchanl Stoutimoro
and Patrick O'Malley.
"The precedent set by Clay county
seems to havo awakened all of North
western Missouri. While Platte and
Clinton counties probably will be first
In the field, Livingstone and Kay
counties also aro interested, and I am
Informed that they, too, will hold spe
cial bond elections this fall."
.Like Clay county, Platte, Living
stone, Ray ami Clinton counties aro
devoid of permanent roads. Several
Inquiries have been received by Judgo
Lowe from tho different counties rela
tive to what procedure should bo fol
lowed. Ho has referred them to the
method used successfully in Clay
county; that ot appointing live com
mittees In various localities and let
ting them proceed as they see fit.
That Kansas Citlans, both road
boosters and business men, will take
an active part in the movement in
Clinton and Platte counties was pro-
dieted by Judgo Lowe.

And tan. Tho thousand
young women In the train
Ins eamp were as red
lobsters, nlways assuming
faced as
lobsters to be red faced. It Is the tan
f wind and sun and llfo In the open.
1 he belles who tangoed In high heels
nil winter long, with never a hint ot
anguish, were nursing swollen, blis
tered feet ns n result of wearing stiff
ilgh sen Ice shoes.
The khaki coats and skirls were bad
enough, they were so different from
the soft, flurry garments that the girls
otherwise might have worn.
It was the National Service School
for Women, this training camp, con
ducted by the woman's section of the
.Navy league, of which Mrs. George
Dewey, wife of Admiral Dewey, Is
president. The thousand girls soon
settled down to the business ot learn
ing how women may help In time ot
war. It wus preparedness of the most
practical sort being undertaken.
Imagine a tented city, laid out In
regular streets, with guards posted and
military discipline prevailing. In each
tent nre five cots, occupied by four
girls nnd n chaperon some matron
who Is enjoying tho tralulng camp
Just ns much ns If she weren't mor-
rled, because she, too, Is a girl again.
Ono of these matrons Is Mrs. Robert
Lansing, wife of the secretary of state,
and she is drilling with the girls in
her $10.rO khaki uniform Just as
though she had never kimwn the so
cial burdens of an official hostess tn
the national capital.
There nre live wash basins and five
small mirrors In each tent also. Be
cause It Is convenient and chenp the
tents nro electrically lighted. And bo
cause It Is further convenient, shower
batliK are provided for the girls in
khnkl. Hut these need not be regard
ed ns luxuries. They simply are mod
ern necessities.
Reveille at 6:30.
Out of these tents, when reveille Is
sounded nt 0:S0 o'clock In the morn
ing, pour the "boarding pupils" of the
service school. The "day pupils" live
In Washington and come Inter. For
half an hour there Is marching nnd
countermarching under the direction
ot throe United States army olllcers,
who are assigned to the camp ns In
structors. They pretend to dislike
their Job, these olllcers, but In reality,
they wouldn't miss It for n good deal.
The girls are so pretty, and despite
their blistered foot they smile so lie
wltchlugly. Af seven the mess tent calls. Break
fast for ono morning consists of eggs
nnd bncon, prunes, linked potatoes und
coffee. Another morning It Is or
anges, bacon and hominy, bread and
butter, green onions and coffee. The
only difference between the fnro of
the woman's training enmp and that ot
the United States Marino corps is that
tho girls nre allowed butter three
Hint's n day und the murines only
twice. But they thrive on It. Bless
you, there was less need of rouge
nmoiig these thousand girls Inst week
than any week In all their lives. The
unbreakable crockery and the camp
"silver" nr lent by the marine corps,
by tho way.
Then comes tho ceremony of tho
chnnglng ot the guard, which is an
other regulation borrowed from the
United States army. Aud nfter that
there Is a busy day.
The one obligatory course is that ot
Red Cross first old nnd surgical dress
ing of wounds. No less than 11,000
yards ot gauze Is used In the classes
In ii week's time. A Red Cross bend
nurse nnd 30 trained assistants nre
tho Instructors In these classes, of
which there aro five dally, each put
ting In nn hour.
Girls Enjoy Signaling.
Then tho girls limy take semaphore
signaling lessons If they like, nnd
nearly all ot them do. "Wigwagging"
Is ono of the most enjoynhlo of all the
ennip activities. The "pupils" I earn
the signal nlphnbet. Hurting some dllll
culty with tho letters beyond "N" and
pronouncing "It" particularly linril,
but they learn it nnd can transmit dis

others, while another Important In
structlon tent Is that where sewing
for the wounded Is taught and whero
many sewing machines (ire kept hum

But the hospital, tent, after nil, is
the chief center ot Interest In tho
camp. One lesson, for instance, con
sisted In demonstrations of how to
make a bandage nnd bow to dress and
bind an Injury, and how to use n
broom In properly sweeping n lloor
all being practical duties that fall to
itrmy nurses.
Then there Is drilling nnd more

Finally comes taps, nt ten o'clock,

are no regulations of nuy sort.
