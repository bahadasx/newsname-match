BRITISH DRIVE ENEMY FROM
HIS SECOND LINE TRENCHES
The Albert Salient
ARRAS
ALBERT
BAPAUME
X r
PERONNE
ESTREES
S
X X X-VILLAf.ES TAKEN BY THE BRITISH VESTERDAY.
By FRANK H. SIMONDS.
The simplcst fashion in which to explain the latest development in
ihe Anglo-French offensive is to illustrate it by some such rough sketeh
as accompanies this article. When the Anglo-French attack began the
(ierman line in Picardy was a great half circle or salient bulging out be?
tween Arra* and Estrees and reaching ita extreme westcrly point a lirtle
north of the town of Albert. Both Albert and Arras were in British hamls.
In the first days of the Allied attack the French and British struck
directly east from Albert and the Somme towns to the south. They ad?
vanced some three or four miles until the French, who were <=outh of thc
British. almost reached Peronne, and both the French and British troop?
bad occupicd all the first-line trenches of the Germans and the rrench
some of the second.
This advance. shown on the sketch by the shadcd section, cut off nea-ly
half of the German salient and carried the new Allied line a little east of
the longitude of Bapaume. Instead of holdinp a wide salient, the Germans
mow occupied a narrow salient, with the French and British well in their
rear.
British Drive a Deep Wedge.
In effect the Anglo-French operation bad driven a deep wedKe into
ehe German lines on a front of perhaps fifteen miles and to a depth cf
about four. This was the first phase of the much advert.sed offensive.
\fter this was accomplirhed there were reveral days of quiet. while the
French and British consolidated their new positions and brought up their
hoavv artiilery.
The new British attack, as indicated in the latest communiques, is
aking a wholly different dire.-uon. Or.-7-inally the French and Britiah
advanced from west to cast. Now tho British attack is from south to
?orth the direction indicate,! hy the arrow on the accompanying sketch.

salient the position of the Germans insid-* of it becomes more and more
perilous, they are increasingly exposed to the danger of bemg isola-d,

London, July 14.?London, cele
brating Bastile Day, was thrilled to?
day by the news that General Haig
had opened thc second phase of the
great offensive in Picardy.
In g battle that ev.ee.led in vio
lonce the fir.-t aaaaolt thirteen days
ago the Britiah troops carried tho
(Ierman second line on a four-mile
front, captured thc village*; ol Baz
antin-le-Petit, Bazantin-le-Grand and
Longueval and seized the remaining
(Ierman positions in the Trone*
Wood. They pushed 'heir line for
? ward a mile.
Everywhere in the capital to-day
; the French trieolor was displayed.
England was determined to show her
apprcciation and admiration for her
ally, whose fight has been so valiant.
Perhaps it was the same spirit that
inspired the British soldiers thi*
morning when they sprang forward
to the attack.
The battle began at daybreak.
Only the day hcl'or<* .esteiday th.*
German first line from Hardecourt
to Ovillers had been won and th?
big guns had begun to pound 0*at*
more at the Teuton trenches. Lon?

sault would bagin until the shells
had cleared the way more com?
pletely.
