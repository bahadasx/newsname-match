is filial. No argument could swerve
tho official from his course, however.

Following is a statement to th'
council which, accompanied the, an
nual report:
Since July 1, 1915, we have made
thirty -four water taps which brings
our total number to twelve hundred
and fifty-nine, about nine hundred and
fifty of which are in service, leaving
(about three hundred and nine deal
taps. In the past year we have bought
an installed forty new meters making
a total ot meters in service nine hun
dred and twenty-five and, ws hav
twenty-five flat rates, ,
There haa been very little exten
tion work done this year, only 900 feet
of four inch pipe having been laid to
the: Rock Island treating plant.
Iir the way of improvements,' we
have installed a liquid chloride appa
ratus In the filter plant (or the pur
pose of removing animal matter from
the water after it has been treated
with hydrate of lime and sulphate ot
Iron. The liuuld chloride treatjjier.t.
costs about 1J cents' per mlilioa gal
lons and nt the same time makes it
possible to reduce the amount of Hmei
and iron 50 per cent. The bacterial
analysis of the water has been very
encouraging during the year and is
bettor now than it hai ever been tu
the history of the water department.
I luring the pa't twelvtf taonths.we
