wcro so many who wanted to go up
tho Canyon that It was necessary to
run tho stngo In ftvo sections, but no
ono was left In town who wanted to
go up.
Tho Cnnyon Is lioglnnlg to look Uko
a city and people nro beginning to
speculate as to where the main town
will bo built. Generally the opinion I
that It will bo on Dutchman Flat
whoro Fon Chlpman will open tho
govornmout post olllco noxt month,
probably tinder tho namo of "Faiut."
Alrendy there aro moro than a score
of buildings and r.s ninny moro tents

The oro occurs in tho lime. About
