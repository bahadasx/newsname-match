Fifty Years
of Masonry
By Joe E. Herrlford, P. M.
CHAPTER 41.
The first year of service by Grand
Master Nelson C. Crews is worthy of
being called a mllestono in the history
of the Grand Lodge- of Missouri. In
the first place he set a new pace of
progressiveness and constructlveness
that all ibut reversed thp hitherto
- adopted policy of the venerable organ
ization. Masonry has always beqn
criticised for ito disposition toward
narrowness as regards the wider in
terests of mankind and its disposition
to be sought out instead of seeking
out mediums for its professed useful
ness. In other words, it has ever been
regarded in the light of a close cor
poration which, while lavish with tho
benefits accruing to its own member
ship, was cold and formal with all
other individuals.
Nelson C. Crews had through his
long training as well as through his
natural disposition acquired such
broad sympathies and unrestricted in
terests not only toward his own race
but toward mankind generally that It
was utterly impossible that ho should
be held in such .really narrow bounds
as those prescribed by any fraternity.
Then, too, he was a man of deepest
emotions, easily moved through the
sentiments of patriotism, individual

love, racial sympathy and, most
all. religious veneration1.
-
This disposition manifested itself i 18 President, ana many interesting ser
strongly in all his utterances and ac-(mons and papers are bcing filven
tions anil was the motive in all his PromInent BPt'?t ministers from all
rnnfiuainriB in the rhrtnr f parts of Missouri and the West are in
r
men this' disposition is plainly an ac-
quired asset to be used as a sort of
convenience and is easily discovered
by the unlmpassloned observer. But
in Grand Master Crews it was real
and sincere, being as natural as his
very life, and on that account always
the most potent factor in his very
great usefulness. He was never a
.four-flusher. Touch him and you at
once found him awako and at a posi
tion which he was .capable of defend
ing even to his last breath.
So, it was evident from, tho very
start "that Masonry was about to take
upon itself an enlivened activity in
the affairs of Missouri Negroes and
that some very tangible results might
be looked for.
Tho forty-eighth annual meeting
was held in the little city of Moberly
during three days beginning August
12, 1914. At the opening session It
was noted that Brothers A. R. Chlnn,
Reuben Barber, George W. Dupee and
Taylor Noland were present and that
neither of these had been absent from
a meeting during thirty-seven years.
Each of these had made his own im
print of usefulness upon the history
of Masonry, and the brethren jqlned
in many felicitations upon this anni
versary of their reassembling. It was
suggested that Brother Chlnn should
write a history of the Grand Lodge,
and this he tacitly agreed to do. He
is well fitted for such an important
task on account of his intimate ac
quaintance with the men and mea
sures which have constituted our an
nals during nearly half a century.
The first annual address of the
Grand Master had been prepared with
great painstaking, .as was ovldenced
by Its high literary accuracy and rhet
orical precision. A high standard of
excellence in this retpect had been
set by hl3 predecessors and the Grand
Master doubtless felt that In this par
ticul&r respect, at least, an eraergencx
confronted him well worthy of his
keenest skill- To say that he met tho
high requirement Is but mildly com
plimenting the lengthy and attractive
paper which ho read1 to tho attentive
brethren,' Grand Lodge matters and
fraternal,, interests had their due as
nlnrjen( in consideration but 'a most
notab'e feature of tho address was the
broadening vision of general race weal
and tho wider outlook or craftahln
among the. Masons themselves.,
It is. a well recognized ten'et of Ma
sonry and one which Is sometimes car
ried to an extent little short of humor
ous that its secrets shall be zealously
guarded from women. So when it was
announced at this session that the
Grand RoyaJ Matron of the Order
Eastern Star was within the ante
room and craved admittance to the
sanctum sanctorium there; was some
perturbation in tho hearts of those
who had guarded the rites .against in
novations, during theso many years.
Tho designs upon the t. b. wore care
fully put away, the Vork was hurried-
ly closed and the w. t. carefully con-
coaled ere tho distinguished visitor,
Mrs. Victoria Clay-Haley, was escort-j
ed Into the room to rccclvo an honor 1
never before bestowed upon one of
her sex by tho Grand Lodgo of Mis
souri. Mrs. Haley being a woman of I
unusual culturo and dramatic ability
Boon had the brethren applauding and ,
cheering her well rounded expressions
of good will toward Masonry. Her
brilliant petition for' continued sup
port and sympathy from the Masons
toward tho sisters of tho adoptive
rites not only mot with most hearty
response but she might have had any
thing else that she chose to ask for
at the time, so charming was her per
sonallty and "so effective were her
manners. Then Brother V. Clarence
Hueston, a brilliant young master
from Kansas City who was in attend
ance upon the body for the first time,
was brought forward by the Grand
Master to make a formal response to
the honored visitor. After this she
was excused. Regular breathing and
regular work were resumed.
At this session the regulations of
tho proposed burial department were
gone over for a second time, accord
ing to law, and were 'ordered to bo put
into force at once. Tho Grand Mas
ter appointed Brothers Joe E. Herri
ford, M. 0. Ricketts and Wm. H. Daw
ley, jr., a committee to revise the
Hand-Book containing most of the for
malities used in the lodges and gave
to these three members sixty days in
which to complete their labors.
Few changes were made in the of
ficial roster. BBrother William Green
of Flattsburg, long a favorite among
the members on account of his ster
ling qualities and genial manners, was
elected junior grand warden and
Brother P. L. Pratt, distinguished for
his Masonic scholarship, was made
grand lecturer.

SECURE CONVENTION HAUL FOR
NATIONAL BAPTIST CON
,', VENTION.
Kansas City, Mo. With the secur
ing of the big Convention Hall and
Auditorium tho cftlzehS'of this city
passed their first mile stone, Jn preparing-
for the visitors of the Great
National Baptist Convention that Is
to be held here September 6-12, in
clusive, This feat was-accomplished
by the committee of.- three, consist
ing of Drs. Hurst,' Williams and
Beckham, -who are representing the
general committee, in charge of the
entertainment of the entire delega
tion. Simultaneous to the securing of
this Convention Hall, news came
from VIcksburg, Miss., that the exec
utive committee of the Congress In
session there had chosen its delegates
for the coming big gathering.
A program covering six days of
constructive work has been' made,
which is argued there as guaranteeing
an unusually Interesting session.
The Committee on Homes has been
at work for some time making as
signments. The cltzens of the city, regardless
of denominations, have joined hands
to help Kansas City entertain her
guest, the first week ln'feeptember.
The Baptist Ministers' Alliance
took action some time ago, whereby
the securing of the big city Conven
tion Hall and other places were heart
ily endorsed.
It is safely estimated by President
Jones of the National Baptist Con
vention that over five thousand Bap
tists will' invade Kansas City during
the week of the Convention.

U. B. F. RECEPTION.
The U. B. F. & S. M. T. gave two re
ceptions to Grand Master J. H. Wil
liams and Grand Princess M. Etta
Bolden durinc thp wpplr Tho ftrt
was given at Lyric Hall, where Dr.
Gy . Brown was master of ceremo
nies. An excellent program was ren
dered and excellent addresses were
made by both the Grand Master and
Grand Princess.
The second was given on Tuesday
night at U. B. F. Hall, Fourteenth and
Michigan, but for some unexplained
reason neither the Grand Master nor
Grand Princess was present, although
the hall was crowded to Its capacity,
the reception being under the auspices
of twenty of the largest, temples and
four of the oldest lodges In the city.
Miss Magnolia Lewis was mistress of
ceremonies at this reception and a de
lightful program was rendered In
honor of all the Grand Officers who
live In the city. There was also pres
ent tlie Grand Princess of Kansas,
Mrs.. "Sarah Parks, and National Grand
Officer Mrs. Lillian Lewis of Denver.
A delightful banquet was served and
a number of excellent addresses deliv
ered, although the absence of the
Grand Master and Grand Princess was
felt very keenly.
f0romweil'olitical writer for The Cin
cinnati "Enquirer, has the .following ar
ticle in his pa"per, dcte of July 9, in
reference to the political situation in
Kentucky and Phil H. Brown, editor
of the Hopkinsville' Saturday News
and delegates .from the State at Large
to the recent Republican National
Convention:
"Speaking of the Hcrt-McCulloch
row, the Christian County Repub
lican committee poured oil upon the
troubled waters when it endorsed Phil
H, Brown's action in voting against
Colonel John W. McCulloch, or rather
In voting for Colonel A. T. Hert, at
Chicago. The friends of McCulloch
throughout the state hold to the opin
ion that the Owensboro man's re-election
in Kentucky was regular; that it
should have been ratified at Chicago,
and that it would have been ratified
had Ludlow Petty, M. L. Heavrin and
Phil Brown, the latter- the only Negro
on the delegation, remained loyal to
their Kentucky vote and pledge.
Therefore the resolution adopted last
Saturday at Hopkinsville, the negro
delegate's home, is offensive to a large
number of Republicans, but no more
so than the scathingly sarcastic arti
cles penned by Brown and published
in his weekly paper against Chairman
Ed T. Franks.
Brown stated as the first of a
dozen reasons for voting for Colonel
Hert "he has been my personal friend
for 20 years." Whereupon a friend, of
the Republican National Committee
man offered as a suggestion that he
"muzzle Brown for the welfare of the
Republican party," but another, read
ing the twelfth reason, ventured that
the Louisville man might not be able
to do that. The twelfth reason reads:
"Although I am a Negro, I cannot and
will not wear anybody's ring In my
nose; and if this be treason make the
most of it." If Hughes wins the Re
publicans in. Kentucky will have to
reckon largely with Brown, since by
reason of the recognition accorded
Colonel Hert, who has been made a
member of the subcommittee of the
National Committee to direct tho cam
palgn, the Negro may be said to be
only one removed from the top."
Brown cast the deciding vote which
elected Colonel A. T. Hert, a Louis
vllle capitalist, making him National
Committeeman from Kentucky. '
