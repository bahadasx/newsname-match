Petrograd, July 14w—A furious

this region the Russians took 3,200
prisoners and captured two guns
and nineteen machine guns.
British Front in France, July 14.—
After their methodical day by day ap
proaches to within striking distance
of the second line of German defenses
and after having brought up materials
and guns, the British were ready for
another big attack and at 3:30 o'clock
this morning the infantry was sent
forward. The assault seems to assure
the taking of the villages of Longue
val and Bazentin-le-Grand, the retak
ing of Trones wood and the gaining
of ground beyond Contalmaison.
The Associated Press correspond
ent, watching the artillery prepara
tion at night, was able to see the
British, as dawn came, in possession
of a coveted ridge where German
shells were bursting, in an effort on
the part of the German gunners to
prevent the attack from proceeding
farther.
Accounts received at this early
hour indicate the German resistance
Is much weaker than on the first line.
The struggle is continuing in Bazen
tin-le-Petit woods, where the Germans
still hold out, and in the woods be
yond Longueval.
OFFENSIVE RESUMED.
London, July 14.—At daylight this
morning the British resuming the of
fensive north of the Somme, attacked
the German second line defenses and,
according to« the report of their com
mander, Gen. Sir Douglas Haig, suc
ceeded in penetrating them on a front
of four /miles. Press dispatches from
the front add that the villages of
Bazentin le Grand and Longueval,
north of Montauban, and the remaining
portion of Trones wood were taken by
the British.
While it was expected the British
would not allow any great length of
time to elapse before continuing their
operations, it was hardly believed the
second German line would be-attacked
after only one day of artillery prepara
tion fbr it was only the day before yes
terday that they completed capture of
the first line in the region between
Hardecourt and Ovillers. The direc
tion of the attack, too, was something
of a surprise, for instead of pushing on
toward Combles, Gen. Haig chose to at
tack the flank of the Germans who
faced Contalmaison and Ovillers and
those who still occupy Pozieres..
The advance to Longueval and
Bazentin le Grand, if accomplished,
gives the British possession of import
ant roads, which have been a great
help to the Germans in supplying their
army directly south of the Ancre river.
British Enthusiastic.
News of the British success was re
ceived in London with the greatest en
thusiasm. It has given added weight
to the request of the government to
the workmen to forego the August holi
days so that the army may be kept
Well supplied with munitions.
There was no news this morning of
Important developments on the re
mainder of the western front but at
last accounts the French were prepar
ing to resume their offensive south of
the Somme, while the Germans were
still hammering at defenses of Verdun.

INITIATIVE TAKEN
LLOYD-GEORGE SAY3 TIME HAS
COME WHEN ALLIE8 CAN
PRESS FOR VICTORY.
London, July 14- David-Lloyd
George, British minister of war, pre
siding yesterday at the entente allied
conference on equipment, declared that
the combined offensive of the allies
had wrenched the initiative from the
Germans, never, he trusted, to return.
"We have crossed the watershed,"
he said, "and now victory Is beginning
to flow in our direction. This change
Js due to the improvement in our equip
ment.
"Every month we are turning out
hundreds of guns and howitzers, light,
medium and heavy. Our heavy guns
are rolling at a great rate, and we are
turning out nearly twice as much am
munition in a single week—and, what
is more, nearly three times as much
heavy shell—as we fired for the great
offensive In September, although tho
ammunition we expended in that bat
tle was the result of many weary
weeks' accumulation.
"The new factories and workshops
we set up have not yet attained one
third their full capacity, but their out
put is now increasing with great
rapidity. Our main difficulties in
organization, construction, equipment,
labor supply and readjustment have
been solved. If officials, employed,
and workmen keep at it with the same
seal and assiduity as they have hither
to employed, our supplies will soon be
overwhelming."
Asks Men to Forego Holiday*
The entente allied offensive on the
western front is only in its beginning,
declared Premier Asquith yesterday in
announcing in the house of commons
that the government had decided to
ask workers to forego their August
holidays because of the demand for
munitions in France. He expressed
conviction that the workmen would co
operate in this plan so as to make it
plain to Great Britain's foes that th«
offensive, in Its present intensity ol
bombardment and assault, would, 11
necessary, be "continued indefinitely.*
The premier also announced that bj
royal proclamation the August bank
holidays would be postponed, and he
appealed to all classes for postpone
ment of holidays until further and defi
nite progress of the offensive had been
secured.

FALLING VICTIMS TO INFAN
TILE PARALYSIS.
One ease of Infantile paralysis
was reported to the state board of
health Wednesday, from Wapello
county and another from Van
Horn In Benton county. The vic
tim of the disease here Is the 2
year-old son of Alexander Hansen
who resides about two mi lee east
of the city.
The boy first became IH about a
week before the ease was report
ed. The house was at once quar
antined and the attemftng physi
cian has advised'the state board
of health that every precaution Is
being observed to prevent the
spread of the disease.
Dr. J. A. Hull, city physician,
said today: "There Is no cause for
alarm In Ottumwa and no reason
to believe that the disease Is epi
demic or liable to become so in
thts vicinity."
New York, July 14.—A marked in
crease in both the number of new
cases and deaths in the infantile par
alysis epidemic during the last twenty
four hours was shown today in the
report of the health department. Dur
ing the twenty-four hour period end
ing at 10 a. m. today there were 162
new cases, while thirty-one children
died from the disease in the five bor
oughs of New York.
New Treatment Urged.
Dr. S. J. Meltzer of the Rockefeller
institute received many inquiries to
day regarding his treatment of infan
tile paralysis which was the only one
raised at the special conference of the
academy of science held last night. He
urged the treatment of all cases by
Intraspinal injections of solutions of
adrenalin.
"This procedure," said Dr. Meltzer,
"may save life and in surviving cases
It may reduce the extent of the final
lesion. There is no danger involved."
The physician declared he had great
faith in this treatment because of the
remarkable results it accomplished
with monkeys.
LES8 THAN THE AVERAGE.
Chicago, July 14. —Two new cases
of infantile paralysis, making ten in
Chicago, were reported to the health
department today. Health officials say
the number is less than the average
during the laat several years.

IN EAST
New York, July 14.—Shark hunting
or fishing suddenly has become a pop
ular sport along the New Jersey coast
in the waters of New York bay and
along the ocean side of Long island,
as a result of the recent raids by man
eating monsters from southern wat
ers, which have killed four persons.
Reports of the sighting or killing
of sharks are made almost hourly and
some fishermen are bringing in big
fish they have killed. Only a few of
these, however, are described as man
killers. One shark was killed near
Fairfield, Conn.
Shark hunters at Matawan creek, N.
J., believe they have the shark that
killed a man and a boy penned up in
the creek behind a series of wire nets
which have been strung across the
creek at intervals from its mouth to
the scene of the tragedy sixteen miles
from the entrance. Men armed with
shotguns, rifles and harpoons are pa
troling the waters of the creek again.
At almost low tide today the body
of Lester Stillwell was found In the
cheek about 200 feet from the spot
where he disappeared after being at
tacked by the shark. The body had
been bitten nearly in two above the
waist.
Joseph Dunn, the boy whose leg was
terribly torn by the invader of Mata
wan creek, Is in a critical condition in
a New Brunswick, N. J., hospital.

BUTBRIEFNRTICE
INDICATIONS ARE THAT GERMAN
VESSEL IS READY TO MAKE A
8UDDEN DASH.
Bahlmore, Md., July 14. —Silence
continues as to the date of departure
of the supersubmarlne Deutschland.
The tug Timmins, which met her at
the capes and convoyed her to Balti
more, remains fastened at the pier.
She is so close to the submarine It
probably would take only ten minutes
to get the latter from the mooring into
open water. A big hydroaeroplane,
practically completed, was stored on
the pier of the Eastern Forwarding Co.
where the Deutschland is docked. It
was intimated that the flying boat
will scout around the capes before the
submarine makes her dash for the At
lantic.
The manner In which the Deutsch
land has been cleared of everything
she brought over, even of pig iron bal
last, led to the idea that she would
return to Germany heavily laden. Capt.
Koenig ridiculed the report from Am
sterdam that the principal object of the
Deutschland's voyage was to convey a
consignment of diamonds.
G. Prusse of the submarine's crew
made application to the local immigra
tion authorities to be landed in this
country. The application was granted
and Prusse will remain In the United
States.
BOMB INTERCEPTED.
Baltimore, Md., July 14. —A messen
ger boy carrying an innocent looking
box, apparently a container of love
tokens to the crew of the Deutschland,
to whom it was addressed, walked
down to the pier where the German
submarine merchantman is docked yes
terday.
At the wharf he was stopped and a
policeman, one of the many who are
guarding the vessel, took the box from
him to deliver, as no one other than
the officers and crew is allowed to go
on board.
The policeman was on the point of
delivering the parcel, when something
about it aroused his curiosity, and
calling a fellow officer to his side, he
proceeded to open it.
It contained a timed dynamite bomb.
Examination showed that the infer
nal machine was due to explode within
a short time. Its mechanism was
promptly destroyed by the officers.
Less than fifty yards away, on board
the unique craft which the bomb had
been Intended to destroy, Count von
Bernstorff, the German ambassador
was making a visit of inspection.

EQUIPMENT ON THE WAY.
Word received at Camp Dodge

ment is to replace some of the equip

said, has been found unsatisfactory.
A general cleaning up was ordered
for the camp today, preparatory to the
