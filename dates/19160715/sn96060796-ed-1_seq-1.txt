PATAGONIA.
Interesting News Items Clipped Frcm
the Patagonian.
Ernest Harmon, employed at
the Duquesne, was in town yes
terday. He reports work of en
larging the oil flotation mill at
the Duquesne Mining and Re
duction company in progress.
The capacity of the plant will
be increased from 100 to 200
tons a day.
Paul O'Neill, representing
Kempton & O'Neill, Nogales ore
buyers, is in the field this week,
buying ore from Patagonia min
ers. Those who have no con
tract with a smelter can dispose
of their ores with this firm on a
satisfactory cash settlement.
Any amount of any kind of ore
is wanted.
Machine drills have been start
ed at. the Red Mountain this
week, on the Andes property of
C. C. Sanders. While formerly,
when working by hand, depth
was made at the rate of only a
few inches a day, now several
feet will be made in the same
time. The Andes is one of the
best prospects in the Patagonia
country, and its development is
watched with keen interest by
mining men familiar with this
district. A few carloads of chal
cocite were shipped from this
property recently while doing
development.
The Three R. mine is shipping
35 tons of high-grade copper ore
a day at the present time. Plans
for erecting the oil notation plant
are progressing, and work of
construction will be started
within a few difys. In the big
crew employed at the mine, the
unskilled labor of which is done
by Mexicans, are about 20 skilled
American mechanics, many of
them being Patagonia boys. Pay
checks from the Three R are
contributing regularly to the
prosperity of Patagonia, and
when the new mill is completed
the payroll will be greatly in
creased. Charley Chapman of Alto was
in town last Sunday, showing
his friends specimens of ore from
the Devil's Bank mine that were
certainly good for sore eyes. Mr.
Chapman informs the reporter
that the shaft being sunk has en
tered a cave and that its extent
and character has not yet been
determined. This shaft, which is
being sunk on the lime contact,
is about 80 feet deep. Prom the
beginning the ore was first car
bonates then oxides, and when
it broke into the cave it was
either a heavy silver or copper
sulphide. It is claimed that rocks
rolled into the cavern give no
indication of bottom.
The Blue Eagle in Alum Gulch,
which has been worked by Har
ry Stevens and Marshall Mc
Donnell, is now under option to
a raining engineer of consider
able repute and first-class con
nections. Lou Stevens and a
young prospector named Kane
are also interested in this group.
The principal work has been
done on the "Leppy" claim,
owned by Harry Stevens. It is
from this claim that the pretty
"peacock copper" has been ship
ped. Recent work has been of
a most encouraging nature, and
further negotiations on this deal
may prove of considerable im
portance to this district.

MEXICO.
President Wilson has never
wanted war. In the days when
his opponents attacked him and
tried to goad him into the use of
the armed forces of the United
States, he remained steadfast to
his determination that the blood
of young American soldiers
should never be shed except as
the last recourse in the effort to
uphold the honor of the nation.
Once, when even graver even
tualities were threatened, the
patience of President Wilson's
statesmanship was rewarded by
diplomatic victory that made the
shedding of blood unnecessary.
It was the President's previous
moderation that gave such force
to the ominous ultimatum which
brought full concession to the
rights of America and humanity.
No president in the history of
the United States has ever placed
the cause of the people of the
United States upon a higher
plane. No President has ever
struggled more valiantly to pre
serve peace with honor. His
critics have proved the case for
President Wilson. Their unani
mous approval of his present
course has not dulled the edge
of his desire for honorable peace.
The immovability of the Pre
sident in the face of selfish and
partisan criticism, coming from
those who thought more of per
sonal advantage than of the wel
fare of the nation, has been the
best security of the American
people throughout the time the
world has been darkened by
war-clouds.
If the sword of righteousness
must now be unsheathed, the
American people know that it is
because peaceful means have
been exhausted. If the sword
is raised to strike, it is because
the head of the de facto govern
ment of Mexico refuses to re
spect the fights of America.
No president has ever tried so
hard to interpret the real spirit
of America. Mr. Wilson has said
that he would rather know what
the men and women gathered
around their fireside, are saying
than to listen to the orations of
the self-appointed.
In his handling of the Mexican
problem. President Wilson has
been guided by the single im
pulse to do what the American
people would have him do to
exhaust all the peaceful means
at his disposal to protect the
lives and property of Americans,
and failing in that, to uphold the
honor and dignity of the nation
by the use of armed forces.
The note written by the State
Department to General Carranza
in response to his threat to attack
the American troops presented
the complete case of the Amer
ican government against Mexico.
As in the European situation,
when the ultimatum with its
ominous note brought full con
cessions, it marked the end of
President Wilson's patience.
The lives of the American sol
diers in Mexico, soldier who were
sent there to protect the border
from the raids of bandits, bent
on murdering Americans, had
been threatened.
In the might of righteousness,
the sword of America was then
raised to strike and in the
struggle that threatens, the na
tion enters upon its task with a
clean and fearless heart.
Behind the president, who has
so truly represented the charit
able spirit of the American
people, behind the president now
in his grim determination to use
the full military and navel
strength of the nation in support,
of American troops in Mexico,
stand the mighty host of pat
riotic Americans, united, valiant
and conscious of the faithfulness
of their leader to the ideals of
real Americanism. Exchange.
All National guardsmen who
had not reported for duty by
July 1 will be tried for deser

cording, to Adjutant General
Harris. The adjutant general
has been ordered by the war
department to furnish a list of
all members of the Arizona
