DRAWS ATTENTION OF COUNTRY
Beginning at Bardstown and
continuing- over flvo days will be
the centennial celebration or the
world famous Cathedral ot St. Jo
soph, an event that will attract
the attention of the whole country
and' members of all religious de
nominations. For months the Very
Kev. Dean C. J. O'Connell, the
pastor, and the people of Bards
town and vicinity have been pre
paring for this event and have
succeeded in arranging a pro
gramme worthy both the sacred
edifice and the occasion.
One hundred years ago tomorrow
the cornerstono of St. Joseph s
Cathedral, the Becond in the United
States and the first west of the
Alleghanies, was laid by the Right
Rev. Benedict Joseph Plaget, the
first Bishop of the diocese ot
Bardstown, now Louisville, as the
center of his spiritual Jurisdiction,
extending from the Alleghanies to
the Pacific, from Louisiana to the
Great Lakes. Around that event
there clusters one of the most en
grossing stories of Kentucky's his
tory and the growth of the Catholic
church in the New "World.
This old temple, the first to
raise its lofty spire above the
giants of the Western forests, today
is considered by those capable of
judging the most beautiful work of
religious architecture In this sec
tion of the world. Its walls, three
feet thick, are of brick made in
the surrounding yard. The build
ing is 150 feet long, seventy-four
feet wide and sixty feet high. It is
ot beautiful Greek-Corinthian style,
before whose wonderful proportion
and symmetry and graceful lines
architectsofthes.-present, tand hi
anTazed contemplation. The celling
of 'the center aisle Is arched and
flanked on each side with a row
of four lovely columns, besides the
pilasters of the sanctuary. After
the visitor has gone Into an ecstacy
of admiration for these towering
and beautiful pillars ho scarcely
can believe the truth that they are
but huge trees, cut from the forest
at the very door ot the church
when it was built, and hewed by
hand to their present shape. Tho
celling of the side aisles Is grained,
all the parts forming such a won
derful perfect whole as to baffle
conjecture how these men of the
frontier could have planned with
such mathematical accuracy. Today
there is not a single crack in the
walls or a bit of dry rot in the
woodwork.
Father O'Connell 'was tho first to
fresco the old Cathedral, which has
been again frescoed this year, and
with its handsome painting, gifts
to Bishop Flaget by Louis Philippe,
presents a striking picture. This
collection is valued at more than
$1,000,000. The congregation has
been offered $100,000 for one,
"The Crucifixion." but "The Flay
ing of St. Bartholomew," by
Rubens, is pronounced the most
wonderful of all the paintings. It
Is considered priceless.
Each day there will be Bomo spe
cial entertainment for visitors on
the college campus grounds, with a
number of contests for which
medals have been offered.
The present pastor of St. Jo
seph's church, as tho church at
Bardstown 1b now called. Is the
Rev. Cornelius J. O'Connell, dean,
who has been pastor hero since
1879. Many dignitaries of tho
church will be present at the cele
bration, the Most Rev. John J.
Glennon, Archbishop of St. Louis,

HEATH A SHOCK.
George W. Holland, Superin
tendent .of St. Louis cemetery,
passed into eternity Monday, and
the news of his death came as a
distinct shock to his legion of
friends throughout tho city and
State. Though he had been feeling
badly for some tlme he had been
able to attend to his 'duties. Early
Sunday morning he was stricken
with uraemic poisoning and was
found unconscious in his room,
from where he was immediately re
moved to St. Anthony's Hospital,
where all efforts to prolong his
life proved futile. His wife, Mrs.
Annie F. Holland, and his daugh
ter, Miss Hannah Holland, who
wero visiting In Indianapolis, wefe
summoned by telegraph and wero
at the bedside when the end came.
The deceased was born fitty-threo
years ago In the residence of the
Superintendent of St. Louis ceme
tery, his father. Peter B. Holland,
then holding the position.
The son entered the employ of
the Cemetery Association twenty
four years ago, and at tho death of
his father In 1897 was made
Superintendent. Besides his wife
and daughter he leaves two sons,
Peter B. Holland, Secretary and
Treasurer of the New Muldoon
Monument Company .and George
W. Holland, Jr., a clerk in the
City Engineering Department. Mr.
Holland was a respected and active
member of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians. Catholic Knights of
America, Louisville Elks, Wood
man of tho World and Moso Green
Club, and was popular throughout
the city. Tho funeral was held
Thursday morning from the Cathe
dral, when many assembled to as
sist at the requiem high mass and
pay their tribute of respect.
ADD HOLLAND.
Col. James P. Whallen, Frank
McGralh, John Barry, Joseph Tobe,
Edward Hcitz, John Scheiltz, Ray
mond Barrett and Peter Gerstle
were tho pallbearers, the interment
being in St. Louis cemetery.
KENTUCKY DELEGATES.
Miss Mary Corcoran, County
President of the Hibernian Ladies'
Auxiliary, and Miss Bertha King,
State Secretary, both members of
the Louisville Ladles' Auxiliary,
leave tomorrow morning to repre
sent Kentucky in the national con
vention that opens in Boston on
Tuesday. The order in Kentucky
owes much to Miss Corcoran, who
has been largely Instrumental In
making the local auxiliary one of
the strongest In the country, in rec
ognition of which she has been hon
ored with tho "highest offices in the
gift of the State. Miss King has
also been an earnest worker and has
made an efficient State officer. It
is needless to say Kentucky will be
ably ropresented.

ENCAMPMENT.
The Uniform Rank, Catholic
Knights of America, under com
mand of Gen. Michael Rclchert and
Capt. Oscar Maier, will hold their
annual encampment tomorrow at
Spring Bank Park, These encamp
ments have always been enjoyable,
and nil Catholic Knights and their
friends will be welcome. Besides
(he military maneuvers thero will be
spirited field contests and baseball
In the afternoon. Rations will be
served at 12 and 5 o'clock.
CONSISTORY IN NOVEMBER.
It seems unlikely that a , con
Istory will be held before Novem
ber. The number of Cardinals at
present In tho Sacred College is
Btty-elght, so that there are twelve
vacancies. One of the difficulties
of holding a consistory at present
arises from the necessity that
would ensue of replacing Cardinal
Scaplnelll, Pro-Nuncio at Vienna,
and Cardinal Fruewlrth, Pro
Nuncio at Munich, both of whom
according to all precedent will
come to Rome at the next con
sistory to receive the hat and will
not return to their respective
nunciatures.

REPUBLICANS
Quarrelling Among Themselves
as "Was Democratic Custom
Formerlj .
Chilton and Searcy Lose Control
of Republican Party to
Original Leaders.
German-American Vote Being
Driven Out of Democratic
Party By Tories.
PIIYTHIAN'S SELECTION GOOD
It has repeatedly been said and
often demonstrated that the Demo
crats could be depended upon to
start a factional row among them
selves at the oUtset or in the heat
ot. a Dolitical camnaicn. but ludclntr
from tho results orlltofastfex?
years some one has wished that
failing on the Republican party and
wished It with a vengeance. It
was predicted that the nomination
of Hughes would heal the breach
between the Republicans and Pro
gressives and Immediately following
tho Chicago convention both would
meet together In harmony. But
such Is far from the case. Hardly
a day passes but from every part of
the Union comes dispatches telling
of bitter quarrels in Republican and
Progressive gatherings, tho latter
element balking at flocking back
wholesale into the G. O. P. ranks,
and if you want to see the average
Bull Mooser rage just mention the
fact that Teddy in his letter to the
Progressive convention bid them go
back. Roosevelt's betrayal and de
sertion of tho Progressives has done
more to hurt the Republican cause
than If he had agreed to accept tho
Progressive nomination and ran
again. An a candidate he would not
have received near the vote he re
ceived In 1912, but ho would have
kept many of his followers from
going into tho Democratic party, as
they have no other recourse. They
simply can not go back to the Re
publican party, because In many In
stances they burned their bridges
behind them by bitterly attacking
different local leaders of the G. O.
P., and they realize they would,
have no chance while these same
leaders control.
Right hero in Kentucky there Is
a factional fight in the Republican
party which bddes no good for the
party's success in November, and
that is the Hert-McCullough row.
Hert is a new man to Republican
politics, up to several years ago
being Warden of tile Indiana Peni
tentiary, while Mr. McCullough Is
the well known distiller of Owens
boro, with a large personal follow
ing throughout the State, who re
sent his throw-down for National
Committeeman, and others In the
party resent tho honors and pres
tige given Hert, a new man In the
ranks, and this latter class openly
say that he is not the choice of
Kentucky Republicans, but was
shoved on the party by outside in
fluences. The local fight of the
party presents a humorous aspect
to the outsider. When the Republi
can party was out in tho cold Ches-
ley Searcy and J. M. Chilton took
full charge of the party's affairs
and had even earned the title of
machine dictators, it being rumored
from time to time that one had to
have the O. K. of these two before
announcing for honors In that party.
But it now seems that, In the lan
guage of the turf, they were only
leading on sufferance. Just as soon
a3 the fortunes of the party ap
peared brighter along comes Mar
shall Bullitt, Dick James and others
whom we haven't heard from in
four years, who take charge of the
local machine and wave Messrs.
Searcy and Chilton back to the
ranks. This means that Dr. Lewis
Ryans will be given an even break
In the Congressional race and he
will win easily.
Congressman Cantrlll. Chairman
of the Democratic 1 Campaign Com
mittee, was here this past week,
and according to the Courier-Journal
was In conference with Gen.
W. B. Haldeman. The result ot this
conference was not given out, but
as these two seem to be workl""?
at cross purposes In the campaign
It Is evident that there must have
been a livoly discussion at that con
ference. Chairman Cantrlll has
pleaded with the German-American
Democrats to support the party
nominee this fall, jv.hlle the Halde-
T. M. PYTHIAN.

every method to drive them Into the

ing that thousands of German
American Democrats In Louisville,
Coington and Newport are openly
deserting tho Democratic ticket. It
has been demonstrated Just lately
that the "hyphenates" are patriotic
citizens and it has been proven
often that this class of Democrats
are preferred to the Courier-Journal-Times
Tory Demociats who, in
many instances, bolt the ticket, and
may not even vote if the weather
Is not to their liking.
It is often the custom for the
press to refer to a political appoint
ment as a popular one, but here fs
one instance when this can bo said
and said truthfully, and that Is the
appointment of 1 M. Phythian as
Warden or the Frankfort Peni
tentiary by Gov. Stanley. "Mack"
Is well and favorably known all
over the State, being ever loyal to
his friends In a campaign and his
ability as an organizer is too well

for congratulations.
THEY MADE GOOD.
The returns are .nearly all in for
the picnic of the Catholic Orphan
Society, and the reports read Mon
day evening caused intense satis
faction. Tho receipts and expenses
of every booth and feature were
read, the system suggested by A J.
Chappell, General Chairman of the
Committee on Arrangements., being
followed, an exact accounting for
every dollar expended and received
being made. Full reports are not
available at this time, but enough
is known to indicate that the sum
realized will range between ?G,000
and ?6,500. These figures con
vincingly show that tho Catholics
of Louisville and of the diocese'
are sympathetic and full of love
for the orphans.
Attention is called to the reso
lution published in - another col
umn thanking the donors of
articles, workers and visitors at the
picnic for their co-operation. This
Is a simple expression of thanks,
but all Interested aro assured it
comes from the heart, and it is
hoped that God's blessing will ever
attend these good men and women
nil through their lives. Rev. C. 'P.
Raffo, In a few well chosen re
marks on tho good work done by
the officers, commended all the com
mlttees nnd the ladies for their
splendid work acd thanked them
In the name ot the society for the
srert results accomplished. Rev.
P. M, Monaghan also congratulated
tho society on the good work ac
compllshed, referring to the splen
did co-operation received from the
people at large. All persons, espe
cially ticket-holders, who have not
yet made returns for the picnic,
would confer a favor by com
municating with th'e society aa
RDeedlly as possible. Returns for
tickets should be made to John J.

DOMINICANS
Little Seed Planted In Kentucky
Grows Into Mighty
Tree.
They Hac Given to Many Dio
ceses Their Pioneer
Bishops.
Conspicuous Are Their Magnifi-
Churclics Throughout the
Country.
FOSTER HOLY NAME SOCIETY
The little seed planted by the
ploneei colony of Dominicans who
came to this country In 1804, set
tling In Kentucky near Springfield,
has grown Into a mighty tree whose
leaves are for the healing of the
nntlnn .,,,, i..TST ' Him .
The Dominican Fathers, athelr
name of Friars Preachers clearly in
dicates, are primarily preachers and
teacheis. It seems to be character
istic of the Dominican to enter a
field ot labor as pioneer and then,
after giving his entire energy to
his mission, to retire and leave the
harvest to other laborers of tho
Lord. They gave to New York its
first Bishop In the person of Right
Rev. Luke Concanen, O. P., who
was destined never to reach his see.
Just one hundred years have elapsed
since Bishop Connelly, O. P., set
foot In New York. On his arrival
lie found but four priests. Un
'i"nted by such a handicap, he
soon set on foot vast plans for the
tuture of tho diocese, only to bo
palled to his reward In 1825 when
his projects were beginning o be
lealized. Turn to another section
of the country, to the Middle West,
and here we see a Dominlran, as
first Bishop of Cincinnati, the Right
Rev. Edward Fenwlck, O. P. For
ten years he labored unceasingly,
untlf his strength spent, he fell a
victim of the cholera. Again, Nash
ville, Tenn., claims a son of St.
Dominic. Richard Plus Miles, O. P.,
as Its first Bishop." His successor
was likewise a Dominican, Bishop
James Whalen, and one of. the first
Bishops of St. Paul, Minn., was tho
Right Rev. Thomas Grace, O. P.
The discoverj of gold in California
In 1848 opened a new field in tho
West for emigiatlon. Catholics In
laige numbers were among those
who hurried after the woalth whlcji
would make easier the hard strug
gle of life. With the arrival of
the settlers there was to be found
a young Dominican who had been
lately consecrated the first Arch
bishop of San Francisco. He was
Joseph Sadoc Alemany.
Dominican parishes, young and
old, have proved themselves strong
In faith, in their loyalty to their
Bishops and allegiance to the Holy
See. Practical Catholicity is the
universal characteristic of Domini
can parishioners. The most prac
tical manifestation of their Cathol
icity is In their churches, monu
ments raised to the faith and last
ing memorials both of slncero ap
preciation of the efforts of the Do
minican Fathers and of love of God.
The churches of Dominican parishes
are among the most beautiful In
their several dioceses. Conspicuous
examples are the Cathedral-like
Church or St. Vincent Ferror, New
York, now in process of erection;
the Church of St. Antoninus, New
ark, N. J., nnd our own St. Louis
Bertrand's.
Thousands of branches of the
Rosary Confraternity have ben es
tablished throughout the land, some
concept of Its enormous member
ship may be had from the fact that
on tho register of St. Vincent Fer
rer's Convent, New York City, there
are enrolled the names of 800.000
Rosarlans.
The Holy Name Society has in the
past six years been blessed with a
growth unheard of In confraternity
history. In that time new societies
have been erected to the number of
2,500, including those established
in many colleges, high schools,
penal and other institutions. In
each diocese there has also been
erected what is knowa as the dio
cesan union. The union is the cen
tral Influence that stimulates and
coutrols tho activities of the various
parish branches. No mention ot
the Holy Name Society would be
complete were tho work of the
saintly apostle of the Holy Name In
America, Father Charles H. Mc
Kenna, O. P., P. G., omitted. For
nearly half a century this valiant
priest has labored until ingly to
preach tho Holy Name of Jesus.
In many a lectin e hall the white
habit is to be seen and numerous
are the learned volumes from
Dominican pens. This activity Is
not confined to Europe alone, for in
tho Catholic Univeislty at Washing
ton, D. C., tho Very Rev. D. J.
Kennedy holds the chair ot sacra
mental theology; while In the far
off Islands of the Pacific it is the
Sons of St. Dominic who success
fully maintain tho great and thriv
ing University of St. Thomas at
Manila. Here we might mention
that since the foundation of the
Foreign Missionary Seminary at
Osslnlng, N. Y., the Dominican
Fathers of the Providence of St.
Joseph have in a peculiar way given
their whole-hearted support to this
great and deserving work, and the
apostolic spirit, ever a chief trait
of the order, is manifested today in
the presence at Maryknoll of two
professors wearing the habit ot the
Friars Preachers.
In the short space of ten years
the community In the House of
Studies, Brookland, D. C, has had a
rapid growth. The number of
novices in the community that first
took possession of the House of
Studies was thirty. Today tho
beautiful and Imposing College of
the Immaculate Conception houses
sixty-eight novices, eight student
priests, twelve professors and seven
lay-brothers. Every available room
Is occupied. -The community Is by
far the largest or those grouped
about the university.
Their three mission bands have
headquarters at the central points
of the mission fields. The Eastern
band at St. Vincent Ferrer's, New
York City; the Western band at
Holy Rosary Convent, Minneapolis,
and the Southern band at St. Louis
Bertrand's church, Louisville. The
Superiors of the bands are Father
J. "Healy, In the East; Rev. C. M.
Theunte. In the West, and Father
M. J. Ripple, In the South.

for a settlement." Lansdowne ad
vocates the maintenance of a garri

der command of Gen. Maxwell.
According to the London morning
papers of Tuesday it probably will
be well Into the year 1917 beforo
tho new Irish Parliament is set up.
Little can be done other than the
Introduction of the bill before Par
liament rises early In August for a
recess of from six to eight weeks,
so that the passage of the bill is
not likely before late October.
Premier Asquith, In explaining the
Irish agreement In the House ot
Commons, said that it was proposed
that tho bill should remain in force
during the wat and twelve months
thereafter, -and if JParlIamea had

new bill would contain general pro
vision reserving for the exclusive
authority of the Imperial Parlia
ment and Government not only tho
navy and army, but all matters
emanating out of tho war. He em
phasized that there was no Intention
on tho part of those who might bo
associated with Government of Ire
land to encroach In any way in re
gard to a successful continuation
of the war. "We have hero," said
the Premier, "an arrangement such
as never was possible before," and
he appealed to the House to take
advantage of the opportunity whlcu
might never recur.
Irish Press News Service
"It would be Infinitely better to
remain as we are for fifty years to
come, under English rule, than to
accept these proposals."
The above words aro from 'Car
dinal Loguo, Primate of all Ire
land and head of tho Catholic
church In Ireland, the successor of
St. Patrick, after a line of fifteen
centufles of Irish Bishops. Thus
the Cardinal and Bishops McKenna,
McHugh, McRory and Mulhern, of
Ulster, repudiate the agreement ot
John Redmond, Sir Edward Carson
and Lloyd-George to establish a
State within Ireland along religious
lines Tho Protestant Bishops have
also protested against "a policy of
dismemberment." They predict civil
and religious war in tho counties af
fected. The Bishops announce that
tho division of Ireland is a volun
tary surrender of the national ideal
and that such division will lead to
religious fueds after the war. Bishop
McHugh says that the bill intro
duced is intended to conciliate
American opinion and to remove,
obstacles which stand as a barrier
in the way of England's claim to
speak in defense of the rights of
small nations when the affairs of
Europe must be settled at the end
of the war. John Redmond states
that the exclusion of the Protestant
counties is only a temporary ar
rangement, but Sir Edward Carson
Insists that the exclusion of the
Protestant counties from the home
rule bill is final and definite. As
evidence that the exclusion is con
sidered permanent an executive is to
be established in Belfast with all
the machinery of government, but
without any connection with the
capital of Ireland.
Irish Press News Service.
All the members of Parliament
of the County Cork, comprising one
seventh of tho area and population
of Ireland, havo united in a protest
against the home rulo bill as limited
only to Catholic sections of Ireland.
They prefer to remain as they are
rather than to see Ireland divided
along the lines of Catholic and
Protestant territories. The Cork
Unionists, hitherto opposed to the
United Ireland party, all Protes
tants, have united with the Nation
alists and repudiated the compact
on the ground that civil war will
follow in the districts affected. The
Derry section of ,the Irish Volun
teers Insist that the act will disin
tregate the nation and will lead to
I misery and disaster.
