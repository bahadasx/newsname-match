The official announcement of Judge
Frank H. "Norcross, candidate for t!ie
Republican nomination for United
States senator, appears in today s is
sue of the Record.

story of his life's work and achieve
ments. At the present time he is
chief Justice of the supreme court of
Nevada. His term in that office is
about to expire and it was with the
view of not again becoming a can

NOTED NEVADA RESORT
GOES OUT Of BUSINESS
On account of the fact that he i
unable longer to give the business
his personal attention, Al. Fisher has
decided to close his place of business
in Wells. For the first time in about
thirty-five years the doors are barred
,and the famous old place, conducted
during all that time as one of the
most orderly bars ever existing in
any state in the American union, is
and astate in the American union, is
silent. This bar, in reality a museum
of the wonders and curios of the
world, is known from the Pacific to
the Atlantic, and from the Rio Gran
de to the border line of which the
Great Lakes form a part. Its wonders
have been viewed by thousands of the
most refined ladies of the land, safe
from insult or molestation. It has
always been a hobby with Mr. Fisher
to conduct the business In such style
that ladies could, without fear, cross
the threshold of his bar to view the
curios within the double room. No
blinds have graced the doors and
windows of his place- it being his
rule that the business must be con
ducted with such precision that there
could be no cause to hide the scenes
from an observant public.
It seems strange to note the closed
doors. The establishment is one of
the old landmarks of the west, from
all portions of the civilized and unciv
ilized world Mr. Fisher has gathered
some curio or specimen of natural
history and science, grouping and dis
playing the specimens in the cases
and on the walls in an inviting man
ner, where they could be seen by all
-where they could be studied by the
student of nature, examined by the
seeker after knowledge, and admired
by those who appreciate beholding
evidences at the wonders and achieve

FOR CO. COMMISSIONER
A late political announcement is
that of William Hammond of Ursine,
who aspires to become a member of
the board of county commissioners.
He Is going to come before the vot
ers, he declares, as an independent
candidate for the long term. -
Mr. Hammond is a native of Lin
coln county, having been born and
raised in Eagle Valley, where he
jiow resides and where he is en
gaged in farming. "I believe," de
clared Hammond a few days -ago,
"that I can hold down the job of
commissioner and render just as
good service as anyone to the peo
ple. Therefore I am going to be a
candidate and will go before the
people upon a platform pledging

READY FOR COMMISSION
The Bullionville mill, construct

during the week and it is expected
that the plant will be placed in reg

The plant has been built with ca

WHITE PINE PAPER
COMMENTS OX COPPER TAX
A serious menance to the pros
perity of White Pine county and to
one of the chief resources of Hie
State of Nevada is threatened by the
proposed enactment of tl new rev
enue law reported by the Ways ami
Means cgommittee of the House of
Representatives.
Word comes from Washington that
by his new revenue niCasure it is
proposed to single out th' copper in
dustry and the munitious factor;- in
dustry (largely centered in the New
England states, as t,he two indus
trieswhich shall be bled for the pur
pose of raising additional revenue
required to fulfill the prepare.) ness
program. The bill, which according
to reports will be voted upon in the
house of representatives tomorrow
imposes a tax on the gross receipts
of copper smelters and copper refin
eries of one per cent of the product
between a quarter and one million
dollars per annum to two percent on
the receipts between one million and
ten million, and three percent on the
receipts above the last named fig
ure. This is an enormous tax and very
vitally affects the leading industry
of White Pine county. It is an enor
mous tax by reason of the fact that
the proposed bill only aims to rais-3
the required revenue from the spe
cified industries instead of burden
ing the duty of paying this excise on
all industries alike.
It should be well known to Wash
ington that is generally throughout
the commercial world, that copper is
not only metal' the price of which
has enhanced within the last 2tow
years as the result of the war, fur
Increased enormously in market val
ue. So, too, should Washington know
that the increase in the in
dustry follows, is not limited to the
metals but to wheat, wool, meats
and food producss generally have
likewise enjoyed a period of prosper
ity; and hence they, with a great
many other branches of America.i
enterprise should share the burden.
Indeed one can hardly think an
commodity of necessity used in these
creased at least substantially as t
result undoubtedlly of the European
war. Why then should Washington
administer the blow to an industry
which in some seven or eight of the
states, principally western, are inter
ested?
The citizens of Nevada, although
their state is far within the United
States' borders, north, west, south
and east, have never taken a pro
vincial view of the preparedness
question and so far from decrying or
opposing those who have contended
for the necessity of preparedness
such as the citizens and representa
tives of some of the states likewise
remote from the exterior boundaries,
have done have always taken the
broader national view and favored
preparedness in a reasonable and
adequate measure. If the time has
come, however, when those in
charge at Washington can settle the
cost of such preparedness upon cer
tain industries to the exclusion of
others, it is certainly in order for
the citizens of this state and its
representatives in congress to arouse
themselves and oppose such a vicious
measure by means in their power,
If copper can today be singled out
as the object of such nefarious rev
enue raising law, the silver industry
may be so individualized tomorrow
and honored (?) by a corresponding
enactment.

bilities of such injurious legislation
and the Commercial club of Reno,
which is practically the State Cham
ber of Commerce, we understand has
voiced itself in clear and emphatic
terms to our Washington representa
tives. Action has also been taken
by the Nevada Mine Owners' asso
ciation at a meeting just held in Ton
opali. In the debate on the meas
ure in the House of Representatives
one of the congresmen opposing its
enactment charged the south with
saddling the burden and cost of pre
paredness upon the north. 'He might
have added the west also, for it is
the states of the west which are
vitally interested in that phase of
the bill applying to the copper in
dustry. It is interesting to note that the
copper producers of this state are at
the present time paying a three-fold
tax. They first nay the bullion tax
to the state and county, next pay to
the state and county a tax upon their
property including mining equipment
transpotation facilities and milling
and smelting plant, all assessed at a
value which does not take into con
sideration the amount paid quarterly
under the bullion tax law, and they
then pay to the United States a cor
poration income tax upon the net
proceeds of their operations. If the
proposed revenue measure becomes
a law they will in addition have to
pay to the United States a tax upon
the gross receipts of the smelter
and thereafter a tax upon the gross
receipts of the refinery, the burden
of which refinery tax will of course
be thrown on the smelter operators
by the refinery companies.
The air is vibrant these days with
talk about the principle of "Ameri
canism." Would it not be well to
apply that principle to our domestic
affairs as well as in our relations to
foreign countries? It is essentially
un-American to single out certain in
dustries and impose upon them dis
proportionate burdens of the govern
ment. White Pine News.

XORCBOSS REPLIES TO
PP.OPOSAL OF SAM PLATT
Judge Norcross has made reply to
Sam Piatt's recent communication in
the following:
Hon. Sam Piatt,
Reno, Nevada.
My dear Mr. Piatt:
- Your letter of June 29th address
ed to A. II. Howe, Esq., and myself
as candidates for the Republican
nomination for United States sena
tor, . received. I take this first op
portunity to reply.
You make the following main
proposition:
"That a separate ballot be handed
the voter at the Republican state
primary election containing each of
our names, so that the voter may
designate thereon a choice for Unit
ed States senator and that the dele
gates to the state convention vote for
the candidate receiving the highest
vote at the polls."
Permit me to say that if any prac
tical means, which will protect the
rights of all concerned, can be de
vised whereby such plan can be car
ried out, I will most heartily approve
of the same.
I assume that you have considered
that your proposal not only involves
the approval of the several candidat
es and delegates who may be
ei w in oucuessruny accom
plished must require the co-operation
of a thousand .or more election
flicers and public officials in no way
legally obligated to observe the con
ditions of the proposal and that you
are prepared to present a feasible
scheme to carry your proposal into
execution.
I regard it as regretable that the
views you have recently expressed
were not made public during the ses
sion of the last legislature and that
those who were opposing the passage
and approval of the presept law,
which abolished the direct primary,
could not have had your active co
operation. I have heretofore as
sumed that you favored the passage
of the present law. Such assumption
which I deem reliable, to the effect
that your partner, Mr. Sanford, urg
ed the legislature to pass and the
governor to approve the act now in
force. If I am wrong in my assump
tion, I will be glad to be corrected
and I would be pleased to have you
state what, if anything, you did in
the way of opposing the passage or
approval of Substitute for Assembly
Bill No. 5, which is the present law.
That my attitude towards the
present law may be known, permit
me to state that I prepared the pro
posed amendment to the bill intro-
duced by Senator Harrington and
which is published in full on pages
325 and 326 of the Journal of the
Senate, and which, had ,it been
adopted, would have permitted an
expression of choice by the voters for
United states senator as well as
other of the more important offices in
which the public is most vitally hi
terested, and would have permitted
nominations to have been mada by
such means.
While I have grave doubt whether
any feasible means can be devised
whereby your proposed plan can be
carried out, I am wiljing to co-operate
in every way possible, and to this
Is

end would be pleased to appoint rep
resentatives to co-operate with other
representatives to be appointed by
yourself and Mr. Howe or any pros
pective candidates, if any such there '
may be, in an effort to devise a safe,
workable plan to be presented for the
consideration of the several candi
dates "
Permit me now to present for your
consideration a plan that in my
judgement will work, is consistent
with the present law and will better
accomplish the desired result than
any voluntary agreement which the
candidates can enter into, an agree
ment which at the best would not be
sanctioned by law and is of extreme
ly doubtful feasibility.
I propose that the candidates for
delegates to the convention be re
quested to publicly state their choice
for nominee for United States sen
ator, so that .the., voters may know -where
the candidates for delegates
stand; thus indirectly the voters may
accomplish the purpose which our
present law deprives them of. I have
already advised this course wherev
er I have been and shall continue to
o so. '
It seems now that there will be
ut one main contest before the Re
publican state convention that for
the nomination for United States
senator. I want the rank and file
f the party to know whom the can
didates for delegates will favor bo
that they may express their choice
accordingly. I shall continue to work
along these lines even though we
may subsequenty be able to agree
upon a plan to carry out your pro
posal, in which event the voters
would have a double opportunity for
an expression of choice.
A copy of this letter I am mailing
to Mr. Howe.
With kindest personal regards, I
am,
Very sincerely,
FRANK H. NORCROSS.
YOUNG 4 PEOPLE ON
TRIP TO BIG TREES
Wednesday evening a party of a
dozen or so of Pioche young folk
made a moonlight excursion to the
Big Trees, about nine miles from '
town, They had the Culverwell bus
and it was loaded to the guards. At
the place of destination the young
people built a bon fire, had lunch
and enjoyed themselves generally in
the bright moonlight. Coming home
they had the misfortune to break
the wagon , tongue and that caused
some delay, but they reached home
early in the morning.
Those who made up the party
were: Misses Smith, Franklin, Nes
bitt, Roeder, Orr and Lena Franks;
Messrs. Franklin, Clark, Ewing,
Franks, Smith, Dolan and Harry
Smith.
Kahn Prospective Delegate
E. Kahn has filed his name as a
candidate for delegate to the Repub
lican state convention. Mr. Kahn
will go to the convention, in case of
his election, obligated to no candi
date, but declares that he will work
for the nomination of persons who,
in his opinion, will yield the greater
influence for the welfare of his party.
