Auto Kills Farmer
Last Saturday evening Peter Spies
a Russian farmer who lives a few
miles south of Mcrland left Morland
for his home in a Ford car. He was
alone and had passed a couple of
teams but a little ways when the car
capsized and so injured Mr. Spies
that he died Monday.
Both tires on the left side of the
car were thrown off but the car turn
ed over to the right. The car must
have rolled over him as he was free
from the car when found. He proba
bly struck head fiist on the ground
driving the head down on the spinal
column with sufficient force to cause
the brain substance to ooze out of his
ears. His cheek bone was crushed ia
and bis breast s coved in and bruised.
He never regained consciousness.

THE L Yf. W. INSURRECTION
The arrest of a man for carrying a
concealed weapon on Friday of last
week resulted in a near riot early last
Saturday morning-. On Friday night
the inhabitants of the town retired
for their usual quiet' nights rest
w hen at 2:30 a. m.the fire bell sound
ed its sharp . staccato warning.
People dressed hurriedly and hasten
ed to the streets to locate the fire
but there was no fire in sight. The
trouble was traced to the county
jail where about one hundred I. W.
W.'s had assembled, gained enter
ance and covered the sheriff with a
number of guns demanded the pris
oner who was one of their number.
The sheriff was not anticipating
trouble and opened the door to. see
what was wanted thus giving them
the drop on him. They took his gun,
keys, handcuffs and locked him . in
the cell, took their prisoner and in a
quiet and orderly fashion marched
him down the street. They sent the
prisoner out of town on the morning
train west. They did not leave town
and by the time it was daylight
and showed no disposition to move on
and assumed a braggadocio air over
what they had done.
J. F. Jones, mayor of the city, who
is to be congratulated upon the splen
did management of an affair that be
gan to take on a serious aspect,
proved himself to be the right man
in the right place and the people
have him to thank for averting a
trouble that was hourly growing more
threatening. Mr. Jones organized a
posse of armed citizens and rounded
up in all about 150 I. W. W.'s and
told them to move on. The posse
escorted them out of town taking
them east and when about four miles
out they halted and it seems a young
colored lad who bad joined the posse
was carrying an automatic shot gun
and striking it on the ground acci
dently discharged it. Some of the
shot (bird shot) took effect in the
chest of one of the I. W. W. men
who was sitting at the side of the
road. The man was at once brought
back to Wa-Keeney where Dr. Jones
dressed his wound which, proved to
be only of superficial nature and not
at all deep or ' dangerous. The Xkr-
cumstance, ' however, caused an up
heaval among the I. W. W.'s and
they were' for wreaking vengence.
Mayor Jones was forced to summons
more assistance from town before
order was restored. At Ogallah the
men were put on trains, some going
east and some west. Before their de
parture they threatened - to return
with a thousand men and burn the
town and shoot up things generally
The mayor and his posse returned
and in the afternoon another gang
was rounded up and among them
the two leaders of the gang that
broke jail were found and promptly
locked up and the others driven out
of town.
On Saturday night ihe mayor made
a call for every available man In
town and country to bring his arms
and help guard the town. The call
was well responded to and by nine
o'clock the streets looked like the
Kansas border might have looked in
the early fifties. The town was pat
rol ed at all of its entrances and
when a frieght train came in from
the west at about 10:30 word had
been telephoned that it was full of
I. W. W.'s and when the train pulled
in the report proved true for the tops
of the cars were full of men with
bundles ready to jump off but when
they looked down on either side of
the train at some hundred or more
Winchesters leveled with sinister
meaning they thought better of it
and went on.
Oa Saturday afternoon Mr. Jones
wired Governor Capper ef the .sit
uation and asked tor some -re-eo for ce
ments and ammunition bur owing to
the Mexican border trouble his re
quest could not be granted but the
home guards proved adequate and at
the present time everything is quiet.
C. J. Anderson, of Ogallah, lost two
stacks of wheat presumably fired by
a couple of I. W. W's with whom be
had bad some trouble.
The adjutant general from Topeka
and the state fire marshal came out
to look over the situation. The
most danger anticipated is fire and
the farmers are taking out insurance
on their wheat as fast as possible and
precaution is being taken each night
that guards are on duty. Vigilence
should not be relaxed as these men
are bad citizens and will bear care
ful watching. The two leaders of
the jail breakers were taken to Top
eka by Sheriff AUman and Deputy
Hinsbaw where they will be confined
for trial.
The citizens both young and old
responded Heartily - to tne mayors
O. S. call and to him and to them
the people owe a vote of thanks that
no grave trouble resulted from a sit
uation . which without any doubt
contained an eleme t of -danger- in
greater proportion than people really
realized for these men have been a
menace all over the country and are
of , such character that law , and
human life are held cheap with them,
and in some places have committed
serious crimes. It will be well to
be : watchful - and ' careful for some
time to come especially for fire. The
tank should be kept full at all times
and the fire hose carefully guarded
both in' and out of use as one of
their .tricks is to cut;, the hose.
These precautions are wise and mean
a good deal in case of emergency.
Members ef the I. W. Yf. Are Loav-
in( Western Kansas
Western Kansas wheat growers are
in no further serious danger from
attacks by the I. W. W. leaders, ac
cording to Col. R. Neil Rahn, who
has returned from a tour of inspec
tion through northwestern Kansas.
The 1. W. W. workers are being
driven from the wheat growing dis
tricts,1 Colonel Rahn declared, and
the danger which recently threaten
ed wheat producers is ended.
Colonel Rahn visited Wa-Keeney,
Oakley and a number of other west
ern towns. He found that some of
farmers had suffered heavv losses
when fetie organizers burned wheat
stacks and Intimidated workers. The
tear wtucn overcame residents of a
number of western counties resulted
in heavy purchases of guns and am
munition and the farmers prepared
open warfare if necessary.
"Nearly every farmer and resident
of the western counties owns a gun,"
said Colonel Rahn. "There is real
fear in the hearts of many of these
people-and it would be mighty- easy
to start trouble. . There seems to be
little real danger, tnough. Most of
the organizers and disturbers have
been started east and-the situation
is greatly improved."
Colonel Kahn's report was submitt
ed- today to Governor Capper and
Clir'js I. Martin, adjutant general.

- I. W. W. Gangs Wage War of Fire
oa Kansas Farmers
Salina, Kans., July 12 W. G.
Studebaker, deputy state nre mar
shal, has hit the trail of I. W. W.
experts who make phosphorus bombs
and plant them in wheat and alfalfa
stacks.
From Hoisington, where be investi
gated the stack fires of last week, he
brought home two of the bombs
which will be sent to Lawrence for
analysis. The are believed to be
phosphorus but to make sure they
will be analyzed.
"Clever men engineered that deal,"
said Mr. Studebaker, yesterday."
The bombs were placed in the stacks
at night when there was no danger
of ignition. By daybreak the men
were miles away and chances of de
tection were slim."
The bombs are made of pure phos
phorus wrapped in a rag. The rag is
wet when placed in stacks. This pre
vents the phosphorus from igniting.
Enough of the rag is left out of the
stacks so that it will dry. When
the rag dries the phosphorus burns.
The bombs were placed on the south
side of the stacks, the hottest part of
them. A few hours after sunrise
will dry the rag and the stack will
be on fire before the owne s know it.
Another type of firebrand is a
woolen rag soaked ia linseed oil, said
Mr. Studebaker, yesterday, "The
natural .beat ef the stack and the
Jack of ventilation cause this fire ball
to ignite within a few liours.
'We -found that eighteen - stacks
bad been treated to one of these two
methods," said Mr. Studebaker.
"Nine stacks were burned before the
farmers discovered the cause of the
fire. The work was done with sys
tem and imagine that hundreds of
stacks in western Kansas contains
these bombs." Topeka Journal.

Department of the State Board of
Health.
Topeka, Kans., July 10, 1916.
To county and city health officers:
The public health officials of New
York City have sent a warning to the
entire country concerning the pres
ence there of a severe epidemic of in
fantile paralysis. They have advised
outside districts to take precautions
to keep this disease from evading
them also.
The advice is good but its applic
ation exceedingly difficult. Modern
transportation facilities make every
portion of this country a suburb part
of New York City.
A person exposed in New York to
day, may carry the disease to Kansas
in less than thirty-six hours and to
the Pacific Coast in four days.
The carrier may show no symptons
and yet be a deadly menace to those
with whom he comes in contact.
The disease may begin suddenly
with convulsions or unconsciousness,
or as a severe cold in the .head, or as
a sore threat, or as an attack of stom
ach and bowel trouble.
Contact is the most important fac
tor ia the .spread of the disease. For
this reason &uy one of any age -baring
any of tbe above symptons -er condi
tions should be isolated until the
nature of tbe attack has been deter
mined by a physician.
People are especially warned to
keep away from homes in which an
acute illness is present and from
New York City while the epidemic
continues. Visits from residents of
that city should be discouraged.
Physicians are requested to give the
public the benefit of the doubt in
every case coming under their care.
It is much better to err on the safe
side than to take a chance that may
mean tbe spread of the disease in the
community they serve.
This letter Is not written for the
purpose of alarming anyone. Its
object is to give every one an oppor
tunity to do all that Is possible to
make tbe best possible use of the ad
vice sent broad cast from the New
York Health Department.
S. J. Cbumbink, M. D.
Secretary.
Dictagrams
The fellow who sent out the wild
story from Salina about wa-xeeney
and the mob of 1,200 men ought to
be gagged - down to within ten per
cent of the total silence.
One man said to the writer the
other day, "I have the best and
cleanest crew of harvest hands this
year I have ever had. Four of - them
do not drink, smoke nor chew tobac
co. They all know how to work and
are always ready and willing."
o
The testimony of another farmer
was different. .His men were sullen,
peevisii, contentious, growling for
booze, and indifferent regarding the
interests of their employer. He had
to discharge a part of them and the
others had to be handled tenderly in
order to get any work out of them,
and tbe harvest was dragging along
very unsatisfactorily.
o
The difference ia the luck of these
two wen is mot owing to any -difference
la tbe character of -the two far
mers, themsel ves, nor to aay differ
ence In -their treatment of their
bands. Both are good farmers and
"good men to work for." The one
arew a Duncn or wholesome young
farmer boys; the other didn't.
Strawberry plants set out now, or
at any time before the middle of Au
gust, if properly cared for ought to
produce some fruit next season. If
you care to experiment on the propo
sition you can get plants of the com
mon sorts at warnoak, merely for the
asking. Otherwise we shall have
plants to throw away. ,
