CAPT. KOENIG OP DEUTSCHLAND
SAYS HE WILL. LEAVE IN
TEN DAYS.
Examination of United States Naval
Officers Confirms Statement of Sub?
marine Commander Tliat Vessel is
Purely a Commercial Craft.
Baltimore, July 11.?Confident that
the efforts of the diplomatic repre?
sentatives of the entente allies to have
his vessel classed as a warship, and
interned will prove unavailing, Capt.
Paul Koenlg, master of the German
submarine Deutschland, is preparing
to leave port on his return voyage
within ten days.
Capt. Koenlg expressed satisfaction
tonight but no surprise when inform?
ed that three American officers who
inspected the Deutschland today had
reported that not only was she an
unarmed merchant vessel now, but
was so constructed that she could not
be converted into a warcraft without
virtually being rebuilt. Capt. Koenlg
said he could only reiterate that the
Deutschland, like other submarines
built or building for Germany's new
undersea merchant fleet, was designed
solely as a freight carrier.
At least eight of these vessels, it
was authoritatively learned here to?
day, now are building at Kiel, and
with these ,in addition to the Deutsch?
land and the Bremen, already enroute
for an American port, Germany ex?
pects in a measure to reestablish her
lost commerce and mail communica?
tion with the rest of the world.
The torpedo being a submarine's
essential weapon to make her effective
as a warcraft, it was the possibility
that the Deutschland might be pierced
for torpedo tubes that was the chief
concern of the American naval of?
ficers, headed by Capt. C. P. Hughes,
who inspected the vessel today. Not
only were none found, but an exami?
nation of the forward part of the
vessels' hull, where torpedo tubes nat
i urally would be located, revealed, it
was learned, that the structur was
not substantial enough to contain
them.
Before the Deutschland could be
, armed like a German naval subma

sufficient,' in the minds of the Amer?
ican experts, to warrant their decision
that the vessel could In no wise be
considered a war vessel.
The possibility that guns could be
mounted on her superstructure was
understood to have been conslderd
also. But there were neither guns
I nor emplacements In evidence.
Capt. Hushes and his associates
were given the entire freedom of the
ship and there was no space within
the Interior that they did not explore.
The Deutschlands commander was
not present during the examination as
he was not notified that the navy of?
ficers were coming. I
Capt. Hughes and his associates,
Lieut. Fisher of the bureau of steam
engineering and Naval Constructor
Howard, spent more than two hours
in the vessel. Capt. Hughes declined
to discuss what he had seen, but said
that not only did the young officer
who escorted them through the boat
freely answer questions but even vol?
unteered Information.
"He Is proud of his vessel and I
do not blame him," said Capt. Hughes.
"It is a wonderful piece of mechanism
and a monument to the German in?
ventive genius."
If the Deutschland has any new
devices or mechanism which are new
in submarine construction, Capt.
Hughes now knows them. He would
not say if any such existed, but made
It clear In this connection that every?
thing he wanted to know was frankly
explained. He had no Instructions or
intention, he said, to report any
knowledge he may have gained.
Deputy Surveyor Heyward, who also
wau one of the party, said that the
American experts were "highly enthu?
siastic and were continually ejaculat?
ing."
Capt. Koenig meanwhile was taking
luncheon at a hotel with a party of
officials of the North German Lloyd
line.
The Deutschland today began un?
loading her cargo of dyestuffs. This
task probably will be completed on
Thursday, after which she will begin
to take on her return cargo of nickel
and rubber. The interned German
steamship Neckar was towed up close
tc the Deutschland today and will
serve as quarters for the crew of the
submarine while in port. The report
from abroad today indicating that the
Bremen had left Germany prior to the
Deutschland and was now long over
due, wa-8 denied at the North German
Lloyd office hers, ll was asserted that

GUY COUNCIL MEETING.
CITIZENS PROTEST ? AGAINST
RAILROAD BEING LAID IN
DINGLE STREET.
Number of Matters of Small Import?
ance Attended by Cbuncilmeii at
Regular Meeting on Friday Night.
City Council at its meeting on Fri?
day night attended to a number of
matters, none of which were of a
great deal of general interest. The
only matter of special importance
was the protest by residents and prop?
erty owners living on Dingle street
against a railroad line being laid In
that street.
All of the members of council were
present. Messrs. T. B. Jenkins, E. W.
McCcllum, and a number of other cit?
izens appeared before council to pro?
test against allowing a railroad track
to be laid in Dingle street Mayor
Jennings stated that the ordinance
would have to pass three readings and
would be on file for one week before
it could be passed and in the mean?
time anyone who wanted to could ac?
quaint himself with its terms and en?
ter such protest as he saw fit, all of
which would be considered.
The first readings of the two ordi?
nances, one for the A. C. L. and
Northwestern track, and the other for
the Southern track, was t given* by
Council.
Mr. J. T. Green asked permission
to connect with the sewer system, al?
though he lived a few feet outside of
the city limits. Council granted his
request and went on record us favor?
ing connection of citizens living Just
outside the city limits, where it was
feasible, for sanitary reasons.
A request for a hydrant at the cor?
ner of Purdy and Bartlette streets
was received from citizens living , In
that vicinity, but the granting of the
request was deferred, as Council was
of the opinion that it could r ot spend
the money necessary for this, change
at this time, in view of the many oth?
er necessary expenditurss which hajge
been caused by the laying e\ pave?
ment on the street.
The City Clerk and Treasurer re- .
ported the receipt of % letter freju
the Ely Construction Company stat?
ing that the attention of foremen of
the construction force had been, call?
ed 'to'the wastage of w^terv WmWtky+
by the city, and that %*Ts wVnld be
no further trouble from this source.
A bill of E. B. Lynam for $45.00
for installing a storage battery for
the fire alarm system was ordered
paid.
The City Clerk called attention to
the fact that the scavenger system
under the new ordinance made it
necessary to have the renumbering of
the houses in the city completed,
which work had ben started some
time ago, but discontinued when ths
paving work was commenced. Cotih
directed that this work be pushed as
rapidly as posible.
A petition to pave West Liberty
street to the city limits was received
and Council decided to have this work
done, following out a formerly ex?
pressed policy of paving the main
thoroughfares of the city to the lim?
its, where a request was made for it.
Supervisor White called attention
of Council to the narrowness of Tele?
phone street at Harvtn street And
stated that he thought that the Coast
Line would give space for widening
the street, if the city would request It.
The matter was referred to Council?
man Rowland with the request that
he take the matter up with ths proper
officials.
Mayor Jennings reported that he
had written to neighboring cities ask?
ing what they charged for near-beer
licenses, but had not yet reecived any
replies. The llcensnlng of near-beer
places was therefore deferred.
Upon recommendation of Council?
man Booth, the salary of O. H. Mc
Kagen, auto truck driver, was Increas?
ed to $75 a month.
The police report for June showed:
Arrests 99; cases dismissed, 6; cases
suspended, 7; transferred ;1 appealed,
1; fines $1,007.65; days, 670, or $134;
total fftes $1,141.65.
The library report showed: Books

FRENCH CAPTURE PRISONERS.
Thirteen Hundred Germans Taken
During I<ast Two Days.
Paris, July 11.?The French took
thirteen hundred prisoners south of
the Somme during the last two days'
fighting. There is great artillery ac
tlvtty today in the sectors of Aver
court and Chattancourt. Germans
gained a foothold In the French ad?
vance trenches west of Fumln wood,
but counter attacks repulsed them.
The enemy attack in the Vosges was
repulsed with hand grenades.
