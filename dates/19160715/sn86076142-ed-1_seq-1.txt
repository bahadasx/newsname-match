Defendant's Counsel Says Charge is Tantamount to Acquittal
SERIES OF PARALLELS NEVER EQUALLED
IN ANNALS OF AMERICAN CRIMINOLOGY
CONGRESSMAN NAMED
TO COURT OF CLAIMS
State's Attorney Appeals to the Jury to Disabuse Their
Minds of All Impressions Made By Trained Specialists
and Be Guided By Ordinary Common Sense.
(Bj AMKinIrd 1're.a.l
WAl'KKOAX, III., July 15. An . audience mostly of women,
from grayhaired grandmother to half frightened school girls,
packed the courtroom today in anticipation that the Orpet ease
would reach the jury. Orpet seemed more cheerful at the prospect
that Ms suspense would he ended. His mother sat beside him, as
usual, and his father immediately behind. Attorney Joslyn, for
tlie state, made the closing argument, and asked the jury to ignore
the testimony of all hired experts from Chicago and use plain
common sense.
The case went to the jury late this afternoon. Defendant's
cuunril said the instructions were tantamount to a command to the
jury to acquit.- - ,
Jirtory of the Case
The case of Marion Lambert arid William II. Orpet in the course
of its development became one of the most perplexing in the annals
of criminal history. Motive paralleled motive, action paralleled
action, opportunity paralleled opportunity until the marks of murder
and of suicide became substantially as one. ..
In thai end the guilt or innocense of the defendant, so far as the
adduction of actual fact was concerned, went to the jury on the
mystifying niceties of chemical analysis and Orpet 'b own compro
mising conduct. The mystery attracted unusual interest in all parts
of the United States and Camilla.
Selection of Jury
Trial of the case, including si'lection of a jury, occupied the
better part of two months. There appeared in evidence forty-four
