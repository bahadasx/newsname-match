JURY HOLDS FATE
Retires to Consider Verdict at
Famous Orpet Trial.
Predict Acquittal on Strength
of Court's Instructions.
TRIAL LASTED FIVE WEEKS
Cost County $30,000; Court
Crowded at Finish.
Has State's Evidence Overcome
Reasonable Doubt!
Waukegan, 111., July 15. The case
of William H. Orpet, University of
Wisconsin student charged with the
murder of Marion Lambert, was giv
en to the jury this afternoon.
Counsel for the defendant said that
Judge Donnelly's instructions were
tantamount to a command to the jury
to acquit.
The drama of the name of Will Or
pet and Marion Lambert dragged
slowly toward its last act today.
Before a crowd that jammed and
stifled in the hot court room. Spe
cial Prosecutor Joslyn, closing for the
state, argued bitterly for Orpet's con
viction. Step by step he built up his oration
toward the climax. Early in the day
he had announced he would be
through before noon, but shortly be
fore 1 o'clock he was not through.
Judge Donnelly ordered a brief ad
journment for lunch.
Pictures Him as Slayer.
Orpet sat white faced and nervously
wiping his face with a handkerchief,
while Joslyn pictured him as Marion's
slayer. At times it seemed he would
leap from his chair and attack the
prosecutor. Orpet was visibly chag
rined when recess for luncheon was
ordered. He had hoped that the case
would be in the jury's hands by noon.
Joslyn expected to occupy half an
hour after lunch in completing his
arguments. The court's instructions
were to occupy about an hour, and the
jury was expected to retire shortly
after 3 o'clock.
Mr. Joslyn's first subject was the
"boomerang" testimony of Dr. Wm. O.
McNally, the chemist, who after testi
fying for the state that Marion Lam
bert died of liquid cyanide of potas
sium poison, voluntarily appeared for
the defense and reversed his evidence.
Jo Davis Wasn't Worried.
Mr. Joslyn said that there could be
no doubt that the white spits on Mar
ion's coat were made from a liquid.
Mr. Joslyn said that only one wit
ness had said that Marion threatened
suicide; that was Josephine Davis,
whose story, he said, was at variance
with all other testimony.
"Jo Davis." continued Mr. Joslyn,
"knew that Marion went to meet Will
Orpet. But Jo performed her school
duties as usual that day. She didn't
seem to wonder why Marion had not
come to school, or if she had carried
out her alleged threat to commit
suicide. She did not seek Marion to
find out the result of her interview
with Orpet. She did not believe in
that suicide threat, if she ever heard
it, that's why. Had she believed it,
and were without sympathy of heart,
mere curiosity would have impelled
her to investigate."
MAKES FOR PEACE
U. S. Attitude Towards Deutsche
land Pacifies Germans.
Await State Department's Deci
sion on U-Boat's Status.
BY CARTj W. ACKERMAJT.
Berlin, July 15. Berlin is anxiously
awaiting a decision by the American
state department on the status of the
submarine Deutschland.
A formal finding that the Deutsch
land is a merchantman in the face of
protests of allied diplomats will go a
long way toward convincing Germans
that America is really trying to be
neutral. At the same time it will be a
blow to the Von Tirpitz supporters,
who have been urging a disregard for
American opinion and the resumption
of former submarine policies.
Ambassador Gerard has received
certain confidential information re
garding the Deutschland, but he will
not discuss it in any way.
The American consuls at Bremen
and Berlin denied today that they had
been asked by Washington why they
had not reported the Deutschland's
departure. Such a report was received
here from London. They said they
knew nothing of the Deutschland's de
parture. WAGON FALLS ON BOY
Robert Hutton Near Death as Result
of Morning Accident.
Robert Hutton, 16 year old son of
Mr. and Mrs. George Hutton of
Shorey, lies at the point of death in
Stormont hospital as a result of in
juries received shortlyafter 9 o'clock
this morning when a wagon which he
was driving overturned.
Hutton was approaching the Ema-hizer-Spielman
warehouse at Second
and Quincy when he apparently made
a sharp turn. The wagon, loaded
with iron beds and springs belonging
to the William Schick company, by
whom the injured boy is employed,
toppled over.
Before help could reach Hutton the
horses hitched to the wagon tramped
over practically every portion of his
body. Following an examination at
the hospital by Dr. A. H. Marshall, it
was found the boy suffered a fracture
at the base of the brain, a deep cut
on the left side of his neck and numer
ous cuts and bruises on his arms, legs
and nearly all parts of his body. An
hour after the accident, he was bleed
ing from the ear and had not regain
ed consciousness.
U. S. 'PLANE LOST
Aviators Rader and Brooks 3fot
Heard From.
Armed Motor Squadron In
Search for Them.
General Pershing's Headquarters in
the Field, July 15. (By wireless to
Columbus, N. M.) Aviators Rader
and Brooks, who sailed off on a tour
of reconnaissance of territory west of
here early Wednesday morning, have
not been heard from since. General
Pershing has ordered an armed auto
mobile squadron out to search for the
missing birdmen.
Army officials here do not believe
the aviators have been attacked by
bandits. They assert, on the contrary,
that it is probable the men, who occu
pied the same machine, have been
forced to land on account of their
machinery becoming disabled. In
that event, they are in no very great
danger since they carried three days'
rations, and water has been made
plentiful by recent rains.
Great Apprehension.
El Paso. July 15. The disappear
ance of two of General Pershing's
aviators has caused great apprehen
sion among military authorities here.
Representatives of bandit bands in
the vicinity of the punitive expedi
tion's base at Colonia Dublan have
been numerous recently.
Soldiers, who have been shot from
motor trucks along the line of com
munication by Mexican snipers, are
being brought into the base hospital
at Fort Bliss daily. Although, by vir
tue of the strict army censorship, the
fact has been suppressed, it is welt
known here that hostile Mexicans in
fest the country surrounding the puni
tive base.

REAL SHARK HUNT
U. S. Coast Guard Now Takes
Up the Chase.
No Reason for Panic Among
Bathers, Says Bureau.
Washington, July 15. The coast
guard took up today active direction
of efforts to rid the North Atlantic
oast of sharks which have jleared
many beaches of bathers. The life
saving service will render aid.
The plan of the coast ?;uard is to
ascertain iirst whether the sharks r.re
few in number or comprise laige
schools. If they are not numerous a
cutter will be used to fish for them,
but the presence of numbers would
r.ccepsittite extensive operations.
The bureau of fisheries has issued a
statement declaring there was no rea
son for panic among bathers.

Matawan Mayor Offers $100,
"Dead or AHye."
Funeral of Latest of Fonr Vic
tims Held Today.
Matawan. N. J., July 15. Crowds of
pleasure seekers who would ordinarily
spend their Saturday afternoon at the
beaches, flocked here today to Join in
New Jersey's game of shark hunting,
but there was little hope held out by
the seasoned hunters that the big fish
which has killed four persons within
the last fortnight will now be caught.
The funerals of Lester Stillwell and
Stanley Fisher, the shark's most re
cent victims, will be held here this
afternoon. At the same time it is
believed the search for the maneater
which attacked them will virtually
come to a halt.
The rumors of a shark seen near
Keyport, but for 24 hours there has
not been an authentic report of the
presence of the man-killer in Matawan
creek. A vailroad engineer reported
sighting the big fish as he passed over
a trestle, but this is doubted. Most of
the searchers fear the shark escaped
from the creek soon after killing Still
well and F'pher.
Shark Post Leader Gives Up.
Patrol of Matawan creek was re
sumed early today by several men
carrying long pikes. It was not ex
pected, however, that further dvna
miting would be done, and todaVs
task may be one of "watchful wait
ing" Captain Edward Craven, aged ex
sea captain, who has been one of the
leaders in the hunt for the shark, gave
up completely today.
"The creek be d and the shark
be d , I think I'll quit." was the
way the captain sized things up.
Acting Mayor Henderson has of
fered a reward of $100 for the cap
ture of the shark and a pro rata re
ward should more than one of the man
eaters be killed. A movement is on
foot to persuade Governor Fielder to
offer a reward on behalf of the state.
In the meantime, great interest cen
ters here in the steps to be taken by
the government. It is expected revenue
cutters will soon patrol the Jersey
coast.
FLAUNTS YELLOW PERIL
Washington, July 15. Senator
Works of California, addressing the
senate on the Japanese problem in
America, declared that the issue could
be solved only by keeping the Pacific
ocean between peoples of the two na
tions. Because of the essential racial
differences', the senator asserted there
could be no social tolerance of the
Japanese. because that inevitably
would lead to race amalgamation,
which was unthinkable.
He argued that the time had come
when the United States, as an act of
self-preservation should declare by
statute its purpose "not to tolerate
further race complications on our soil
by preventing immigration of all peo
ples not of the white race."

But, at the Eastern Forwarding

He was confident of success. He did
not brag. He's too quiet for that. But
he told friends he would pass the

Just how he will accomplish this re
markable feat he would not say.
Some persons connected with stowing

she would dash out tonight. This seem
