4 for the Com
To the Stockholders and Pros
pective Patrons of the Co-opera
tive Creamery:
It has been resolved that we,
the undersigned members of the
committee for the organization of
the co-operative creamery say a
few words of encouragement
to this new enterprise. As so
much has been done and said to
create a feeling of dissatisfac
tion among the subscribers by
competitors (and people who
have a motive in protecting their
own interests only) we believe
that By hearty co-operation and
by sticking together as one man
we are going to make it a suc
cess and that a successful cream
ery here will mean more diversi
fied farming and this will im
prove our land and make it more
valuable. We know that the
success of the new creamery de
pends upon the patronage of the
same and the development of our
herds will follow, and if we have
accomplished this we have made
a success for the country and for
the town.
It is true there are some cream
eries that have failed, not only
here in the west but also in the
east, but is not this the same
with some other business or eVen
the farm. Some farmers are
even unsuccessful and how many
a business man fails because he
lacks confidence in his own busi
ness. When we started the
work of organizing a creamery
we fully considered every advan
tage and disadvantage and have
acted in the best of faith for our
country and town and we feel
that we are going to succeed by
sticking together and will always
do all we can to make good. Let
us all be boosters now and put
our shoulders to the wheel to
help a good thing along.
Thanking all those who have
helped to create the organiza
tion of this new enterprise and
wishing the best of success to
the same, we beg to remain,
Sincerely,
John Hoene,
W. B. Hussman,
Felix Martzen.
Co-operation Makes
Co-operative Success
This applies directly to the
new creamery organized by the
citizens of Cottonwood and vi
cinity.

particular line of business and

Man Killed Beneath Disc
a
John Ogden, a farm hand em
ployed on the Wren & Greenough
farms at Denver, met death
Monday eyening when the team
he was driving became frighten
ed and ran away, the driver
being thrown in front of the disc
and injured so badly that death
resulted before a physician could
reach the scene of the accident.
Ogden, who had been employed
by the above firm for some time
and was known as a careful work
man, was moving a double disc
from one farm to another and
was on the public road near the
Denver mill when his team be
came scared as they were cross
ing a culvert and started to run.
The driver was thrown from the
disc and fell in front of the ma
chine, the sharp disc cutting him
quite badly and also causing in
ternal injuries. He was quite
weak from loss of blood when
rescued and died before medical
assistance could reach him.
Ogden was a man about fifty
years of age and came from near
Portland, where he is thought to
have a wife and several small
children.
Is The Wrong Man
The following appeared in
Tuesday's Tribune. Matt Fuchs
will be remembered by Idaho
county people as a former resi
dent of Cottonwood, Inaho:
Bert Alligier, a young man re
siding in the Lapwai section, yes
terday instituted proceedings
through his attorney, J. L. Harn,
in which he alleged he is the vic
tim of a conspiracy in which Jus
tice Matt Fuchs and wife, of
Lapwai are the chief conspira
tors. Alligier alleges he was ar
rested upon a warrant issued as
the instance of Justice Fuchs,
was taken before the justice
where he was denied a trial or
change of venue but was sen
tenced to pay a fine of $10 and
costs, amounting in all to $21.70.
Alligier alleges that he rented
a small tract of land from Fuchs
last fall, the agreement being
that he should plough the land
this spring as payment for the
use of the tract as pasture. He
claims the land was ploughed
last week in compliance with this
agreement and was given notice
last Saturday night he should re
move a wagon and buggy Monday
and his arrest was brought about
because he opened a gate to re
move the vehicles.
Aliigier further alleges that
when he was taken before Jus
tice Fuchs, he was denied a
change of venue and when he
demanded a trial, he was threat
ened with violence, Justice Fuchs
replying that he was fully in
formed as to the facts of the case
and needed no evidence before
rendering a judgment.
Aligier was brought to -the
county jail yesterday afternoon
and committed to the custody of
Sheriff Harry Lydon. He im
mediately secured the services of
attorney and effort will be
made to secure his release today.
—Free Press.
The Chronicle fears the Free
Press editor has jumped at con
clusions, owing to the similarity
of names, in crediting the above
to M. F. Fuchs, formerly of this
place. Mr. Fuchs is farming
near Slickpoo, some 12 or 15 miles
from Lapwai, and is not a justice
of the peace in that county. The
party referred to has been justice
at Lapwai for a number of years
and his name is properly Matt
Fuhs—not Fuchs. We cor
rect the item in justice to our
former townsman, who still re
tains many warm friends here.

The Fenn ball team went down
to defeat before the onslaught of
the local sluggers Sunday after
noon, losing the game to Cotton
wood by a score of 16 to 4. In
spite of the fact that the home
boys had hardly got together for
the season they landed on the
offerings of Shinkle from the
8tart and hammered out so many
scores that it was not deemed
necessary to play their part of
the last inning. Schober, who
had just returned from a trip to
Montana, appeared at short and
held down the job in old time
form. Kasse, a new recruit,
and who, by the way, is report
ed to be "some catcher," oper
ated in the left garden and drove
out two long drives that proved
to the fans he can deliver the
goods at. the bat as well as be
hind it. Ferguson twirled for
the home team, being relieved in
the latter part of the game by
Fred Lange, who seems to still
have plenty of his old "pep" and
control.
The home boys have secured a
game here Sunday afternoon
with Grangeville and will play a
return game at that place on
Decoration Day. Sunday's game
will be called promptly at 2:30
and is liable to prove a decidedly
hot contest. A game has also
been secured with Vollmer for
June 4th and one with Ilo for
June 11th, both to be played on
the home grounds. Other games
will be secured as rapidly as
possible and the boys hope to
round out a good season if the
weather man will permit.
Four cars of fat hogs were
shipped from this place Tuesday
morning, three going to Spokane
and one to Seattle. The ship

and the Cottonwood Milling Co.
Dr. Orr reports the birth of a
fine baby girl to Mr. and Mrs.
Raymond Robertson east of
Greencreek on Thursday of last
week, and at almost the same
day and hour a big, lusty baby
boy was born to Mr. and Mrs.
Reynold Robertson at the B. F.
Robertson home in the same lo
cality. Dr. Stockton, of Grange
ville, was the attending physi
cian in the latter case.
The stockholders of the Cot
tonwood Milling company held a
meeting yesterday afternoon to
consider specifications and prob
able cost of machinery for their
new mill. Mr. Simmons, repre
senting the Nordyke & Marmon
Co. of Indianapolis, and Mr. Fin
ley, representing the Barnard
company of Moline, 111., were
present and submitted prices.
It is probable the contract for
the machinery will be let in the
near future, after which work
on the mill building will soon
commence.

Meets Terrible Death
On Monday while attending to
his work in the brick yard at
Kooskia, John Snyder, the owner
of the yard, was caught in the
mud mixer and crushed in such
a terrible manner that he only
lived a short time after being
taken out.
It seems that Mr. Snyder was
taking the grass roots off of the
lower pegs of the mixer, which
is propelled by horse power,
either whiie the horse was in mo
tion or else the horse started
while he was leaning down into
the mixer. At any rate one of
the revolving pegs caught him in
the sleeve, wrapping him around
the center post and breaking
several ribs, dislocating his
shoulder, terribly bruising his
head and body and evidently
bursting his stomach and entrais.
A school boy who chanced to
be near heard his groans and ran
to the school house for assistance.
The high school boys quickly tore
the mixing pen to pieces and .re
moved the mangled body. In
the meanwhile the doctor had
been telephoned for and Mr.
Snyder was removed to a nearby
house, but the injuries were
such that he only lived a little
more than an hour.
Mr. Snyder had no family and
was considered to be fairly pros
perous. He owned a ranch on
the Little Cedar in the Red Fir
section. He was always a hard
working man and was doing
alone, work which usually re
quires two men, at the time of
his death—Stites Enterprise.
Killed Another Lynx
Ed. Eckermann had quite an
exciting encounter on Thursday
morning of last week with a
large lynx at his farm east of
town. He had just started in
the field in the morning to plow
and was driving along the fence
when some colts in his team took
fright and became almost un
manageable. Ed saw an animal
jump out from near the fence but
gave his attention to the team
until he got them under control.
In the meantime his two dogs,
which were in the habit of ac
companying him in the field,
gave the animal battle but soon
retired to a safe distance. The
lynx, for such the intruder
proved to be, took refuge on the
fence and was kept there by the
dogs until Ed could tie his team
and run to the house for his gun,
after which an end was soon put
to the story. Ed says the big
cat weighed 30 pounds and mea
sured 25 inches in height and 38
inches in length and didnot seem
the least afraid of either him or
the dogs. Its death will no
doubt save the farmers of that
neighborhood many pigs and
chickens.
