Ackennaa Says This Is the
Feeling In Berlin Among

UNITED STATES SHOULD
OPEN NEGOTIATIONS
Holland Says It Is Duly of This
Country's To Act Now
-It Will Aid
By Carl-W. Ackerraan
(United Press staff correspondent)
Berlin, May 19 There is a feeling
licre thnt if a strong neutral nation
Hueh as the United States, undertook to
ncgoiate peace, it might succeed.
Diplomats regard the recent state
ments of President Pomc.ue, of France
and Foreign Minister Grey, of Eng
land, as the opening guns in informal
peace discussion, although the cxprcs
tiions of the nllied leaders, when iianged
alongside tho German chancellor's re
cent reichstag' speech, do not appear
altogether conciliatory.
There was no decision as to whether
the reply to these statements would be
made public by the government, but
possibly this will be done. One offi
cial told me that making peace at this
nlnge would be no more difficult than
adjusting the recent submarine issue.
It wapointed out thnt no belligerent
f an publicly Btnte definito peace terms
while informal discussions continue
with each side making dr.istic state
ments of what It intends to accomplish.
I have just returned from Holland.
The Dutchmen believe that tho French,
Knglish nnd flermnn peotdo nil- desire
peace. The imnression in Holland is
that the" t'me for a decisive victory
for cither Fide has passed, although a
Mimmer offensive by each side is ex
pected. The Dutch think tint it is America's
duty to act now. The time is ripe for
bringing the belligerants together fhev
believe. One diplomat said that if
peace talk continues for n few months,
each side will learn enough of what
the other wants to bring peace next
October.
In Holland the impression is that
Premier Asquith and Imperial Chan
cellor Von Bethmann-Hollweg might
mike pence, but that. President Poin
fare and the Earl Kitchener-Lord
Northcliffe group is most anxious to
continue the war. It is said that the
y.-ar group in England expects Amer
i'.n to become involved with Germany
over the submarine issue. As long
Ps there is a chance of the United
Mate becoming involved, this -group
thinks that England should continue
the war.
The Dutch ire most friendly to the
United States, desiring America to lead
the way to pence. I was surprised
when the Dutch asked me when the
German revolt over food would start.
Although fund is short and the
shortage may increase, the new gov
ernment regulations prevent food dem
onstrations and provide liveable ra
tions. Nothing like the Irish rebellion
i Jikelv here.

He Will Not Ofcr to Mediate
Now As Conditions Are
Not Favorable
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press t!f correspondent.)
Washington, Mny 19. President Wil
son is expected to notify the world next
week that America is ready and waiting
to extend a helping hand to the warring
nations, opening channels of commun
ication as soon as the belligerents feel
there is the slightest chance of starting
an exchange of peaco ideas. His ofier
is expected to come at n speech to be
,dclivered at a meeting of the "League
to i-.nrorce I'eace."
The president will not offer to medi
ate, neither will he make any attempt
to force a negotiation which he consid
ered inopportune to either group of bel
ligerents. The feeling 111 official and
diplomatic circles is that peace is furth
er away today than it has been for some
time. A feeling has spread through the
world s capitals that Germany is most
anxious 'for pence. The allies countries
regard this anxiety as based on neces
sity. This is likely to make the allies go to
the limit in the hope of crushing Ger
many, making their terms so harsh that
they cannot be accepted.
The best information here is that Ger
many does not face the necessity for an
immediate pence. Tho president is said
to believe there is no hope for peace
until after the allies launch their ex
pected major offensive.

E
Says Germans Want To Keep
This Country Weak and
Make Germany Strong
SAYS NO COMPROMISE
. POSSIBLE-IN CRISES
But Adds "In Ordinary Politi
cal Matters Compromise
Is Essential"
Detroit, Vich., Mav 19 Colonel Theo
dore Koosevelt carried a message of
warning to Henry Ford s bniliwic.k to
day. Ho denounced Ford's pacificism,
raked the Wilson administration for
"make believe preparedness" nnd an
nounced that only a policy of staunch
readiness would keep America in the
forefront of the world's af fairs.
The colonel accused influential Ger
mans who reflect the views of the Ger
man government, of approving the plans
of German-American pacificists in the
l uitecj States .with the idea of keep-
iug America unprepared while maintain
ing (iermany's readiness.
Colonel Koosevidt said that, for Ford
personally ne has "not merely friend
liness but in many respects genuine
admiration," but he went on to classify
the automobile manufacturer with the
Tories of the war of tho revolution and
the "copperheads of tho sixties."
"Ford's supporters in the primar
ies," he said, "seemingly come from
three classes workingmeu, who be
lieve that he represents a desire to do
justice to them; pacificists who think
that a policy of helplessness in the face
of other nations will inspire our nation
al safety; and Gei-man-Americaus, some
of them in an honest and sincere mood
of protest and others under the influ
ence of that portion of the professional
German-Americans who have permitted
their devotions to Germany finally to
make them antagonistic to the wellare
of the United States."
'The ultrn-pacifictists have made
their great showing," continued Roose
velt, "principally because thero lias
been no real and resolute opposition
to them. The administration backed
by a majority of congress has taken no
steps for preparedness and has done
nothing efficient to nustuin our nation
al rights. It hns stood for applied
pacificism go far as our needs are con
cerned. Although our gov
ernmental representatives have been 90
per cent leeble, the ultia-paciticists
have demanded a clear 100 per cent of
futility and feebleness.
Has Eye on Chicago.
"In any serious crisis there are al
ways nieu who try to cany water on
both shoulders. It is true that
in ordinary political matters, compro
mise is I'sscntial. But there come great
crises when compromise is impossible
or fatal. This is one of these crises.
"There is no use saying that we will
fit ourselves to defend ourselves a lit
tle but not mucn. Such a position is
equivalent to announcing that, if neces
sary we shall hit but Blinl! not hit soft
ly. The only right principle
is to avoid hitting, if it is possiblo to
do so but never, under nny circumstan
ces, to hit soft.
"There nre two great issues before
us which are inseparably bound togeth
er. These are tho issues of American
ism and prepuredncss. As a people, we
have to decide whether wo are to be. in
good faith, a people able and ready to
I take care of ourselves; or whether we
doubt our national -unity and fear to
prepare, and instead, to trust partly to
a merciful providence and partly to
elocutionary ability in high places.
Those in power in Washington have tak
en the latter position."
The colonel outlined his views on pre
paredness and the administration's
course in the German-American subma
rine controversy und urged the necessity
for "competent men at the head of the
navy, a regular army of 250,000 men,
with universal military training, in
dustrial preparedness and the aboli
tion ot the hyphen." He deplored the
establishment of a government armor
plute plant as "a thoroughly mischiev
ous step of endeavoring to cripple a
great industry." He advocated the
strictest regulation instead.
Criticises Wilson.
The colonel nls severely criticised
the president for appointing, he said,
the heads of the war, state and navy
departments "for political reasons."
"We, through our representatives at
Washington," declared the colonel,
"have absolutely refus d in the small
est degree to prepare during these 22
! mouths of world cataclysm. We have
J refused to learn the smallest part of the
lesson being written in Europe. We
have endeavored to deceive ourselves
by announcing that in this policy of
Supine innctiun and of failure to per

really deceived ourselves and most cer-
THE

tuiuly we have not deceived others.

Industrials Advance
YhileWar Stocks Sag
New York, May 19. The New York
Evening Hun's financial review today
said:
The division of war and peace stocks
into two camps was perhaps more clean
cut today than at any recent time. Rail
roads again furnished tho feature with
a vigorous bull movement under the
leadership of Reading. The volume of
buiues8 done in Reading was large, car
rying wtih it pronounced gains, not
only in railroads but in induBtriuls not
directly affected by war orders.
Atteution was attracted by he
srengh of racion coppers, consolidated
gas and others. With the exception of
American locomotive, war issues were
soft and neglected.
There was an early fractional ad
vance in Baldwin locomotive, , United
fruit and other marine issues, but oth
ers of that character lost later and busi
ness in them was restricted. The plung
ing activity in railroads made up for
dullness in specialties. Thvs turnover
bofore the end of the fourth hour ex
ceeded a million shares. In later trad
ing an irregular tone developed as the
result of a profit taking.
OVER FATE OF LYNCH
Demands England Stay Execu
tion Until United States Is
Better Informed
Washington, May 19. President Wil
son is most anxious today as to the fate
of Jeremiah Lynch, American, tried by
court-martial in England 011 a charge
of participating in the Irish rebellion.
News of Lynch 's plight reached the
president as he sat in a theatre box. !
He instructed Acting Secretary of State i
Polk to cable a virtual demand to
England to. stay the execution until the
United States was better informed.
Lynch 's execution was set for 4 a. m.
Dublin time today. Tho president is
worried, not knowing whether his do
mund reached England in time to save
tho American.
The message from tho Amorican em
bnssy in London transmitting the Dub
lin consul's report makes the fate of
Lynch doubtful. Tho state department
made public the following:
"The consul at Dublin reports thnt
Jerniinh Lynch was tried by a field
court martial yesterday for, participa
tion in the Irish rebellion. (Word lost
transmission) will happen Friday morn
ing. Will advise further when sen
tence known."
No News of Lynch.
Now York, May 19. Eight hours
after the time fixed for the execution
of Jcrmiah Lynch, American, court
martialed 011 a charge of participating
in the Irish rebellion, no information
as to his fate had reached this city from
Dublin. It was not known here whether
President Wilson appealed to the Bri
tish authorities in behali of Lynch.
Lynch's Case Held Up.
London, May 19. Tho case of .Ter
miah Lynch, American, court-martialed
for participation in the Irish riots, was
held up by the British government to
day for further investigation.
General Sir John, jvtaxwoll was re
quested not to dispose of the Lynch case
until an inquiry could be made, it was
officially announced.

the nossibilitv of anv other than Thco-
candidate for the progressives.
The republican and progressive con
ventions will be in constant communi
cation by telephone, it is reported. The

SIXTEEN BANDITS
KILLED III CLASH
After Raiding Hearst Ranch
Were Pursued by the
Employes
ENTIRE GANG EITHER
KILLED OR CAPTURED
Banditry General Outside Im
mediate Neighborhood
of Troops
By H. D. Jacobs.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Advanced Base, Snn Antonio, Chi
huahnnMay 0. (By courier to Colum
bus, N. M., May 19.) Chasing Villista
bandits is like fighting a stubborn fire;
squelch them in one pluce and they
break out in another.
The .American troops have clashed
with the main body of Villistas in four
"major 'engagements. " In each case
the enemy has lost heavily and his
force has been scattered and broken
up. Three times tho bandits have re
organized and recruited almost to their
original strength. And there is every
possibility that they will uo able to
do so again.
Colonel Dodd and his column of the
Sovefith cavalry struck the Villistns at
Guerrero on March 2H, defeating them
in a running fight find sending them
scurrying into the hills in small groups.
Four days later Colonel Brown of the
Tenth surprised a force composed of
these scattered remnants at Aguas Cal
ientes. Again the bandits were brok
en up. Then came the only real stand
tho Villistas have made, the battle
wilh Dodd nt Tomacliic. April 22. Al
though badly whipped at least a hun
dred of the Villistas who participated
in the engagement wero nblo to get to
gether nnd give Major House's Elev
enth cavalry a battle at Ojo Aznles.
Nearly half of the Mexican forcn was
left dead on tho field Many badlv
wounded are reported to havo gotlen
away.
Desnite this overwhelming defeat, it
is still nn open question whether this
bund will be able to reform again.
Tho American expedition has been in
Mexico nearly two months. Pnncho
Villa, whof.o capture or death were the
main objects, has been driven into re
tirement. Reported from various sources
to be badly wounded, he may be cither,
dead or disabled. At least ho hns been
eliminated ns a political and military 1
factor in ulexico for tho timo being.!
About 150 of his men, including those
lost at Columbus, havo been killed. Sev
eral of his chiefs are among the dead.
Yot banditry is still prevalent in
those parts of Chihuahua not actually
policed by American troops. Report?1
nre being received almost daily of va
rious sized bands operating in districts
removed from the American lines. Some
of these are identified as Villistas. The
identity of the others is doubtful, in
dividuals of known Villista sympathies
nre constantly being brought into camp
by patrols. Even now several detach
ments are in pursuit of Candelerio Cer
vantes, reported nt large wilh a con
siderable force.
Where is it going to endf Kill n
Villista and two bob up in his place.
Decimaic an entire band nnd they are
recruited to full strength a few dnys
later. It really will ne quite n job to
eliminate every "malo hmbre" in
northern Mexico, but it appears is
though the expedition will have to do
just that if it is going to mnko the
Country habitable. Given time, they
promise to do it.
Cowboys Got Them All.
Columbus, N. M.t Muy 19. Sixteen
Villista bandits were killed and many
captured when a band of 25 cowboys
tom the Hearst rnnch attacked the
Mexicans 40 miles south of Mnderu, ac
cording to nn unsigned wireless nies
snge from the front today. The bandits
bad been raiding the Hearst ranch, said
the radio. They wero pursued by the
cowboys for three days and linnlly sur
prised, the entire gang being practically
wiped out, all uead or capturud, One
leader, Pedro Costillo, was tuken.
American soldiers at tho front have
been sickened in a number of cases
recently, it was learned today, and of
ficers suspect that Mexicans have been
selling them poisoned food. Heveral
Mexicans were arrested on suspicion.
Ninety Mexican prisoners, arrested
after the Jalisco battle, havo been re
leased. They told what they knew about
the activities of bandits, and were giveu
their freedom.
Roads to the front are rapidly becom
ing impassable. Army trucks have been
shaken to meccs nnd drivers oisabled.
Tried to Hang Foreman.
El Paso, Texas, May 19. Seven Mex
ican bandits raided the ranch of Fuller
Brothers at Los Angeles, 00 miles from
i the border, in Mexico, and tried to
ihang William McCube foreman, accord

CAST IN PORRAND
Contest Over Presidential
Nomination Will Make Vote
Unusually Large
fortland, Or., May 19. Oregon vot
ers today are expressing their prefer
ences of candidates for national, stato
and county offices.
Principal interest centers initio race
between Hughes, Cummins and Burton
in the presidential preference primary.
This contest is of particular national
interest because Oregon is ithe only
stato in wliich Hughes' name thus far
has appeared on a primary ballot.
Cummins and Burton both have stump
ed the state. Hughes became a candi
date against his own wishes, tho su
premo court deciding thnt his name
must go on tho ballot if enough voters
wanted it, despite tho fact that Hughes
himself objected.
A heavy vote was indicated ' early
today.
Woodrow Wilson is the only demo
cratic presidential candidate whose
name appears on the ballot today. The
democratic vice-presidential nomination
is sought by Governor Major of Mis
souri, William Grant Webster of Illi
nois, and Vice-President Marshall.
Only in the Third congressional dis
trict (Portland) is there a contest for
congress. Representative C. N. Mc
Arthur is opposed by E. V. Littlefield
and A. W. Lafferty. Tho campaign for
this republican nomination has been
particularly bitter, nnd national prohi
bition was made the chief issue.
The position of secretary of stato has
brought forth a hot contest between
Ben W. Olcott (incumbent) nnd C. It.
Moorcs on tho republican ticket. Olcott
is a brother-in-law of ex-Governor
West, a democrat. Republicans ques
tioned Olcott 's orthodoxy and Moorcs,
horotoforo secretary of the republican
state central committee, was put up
to defeat him for the nomination.
-LIGHTVOTE IS CAST
Democrats Shy At Polls-Little
More Than Half of
Voters Will Vote
Tho curly indications today are thai
tho vote cost at tho primary election
will bo light even as the registration
for this election was lighter than the
vote cast at the last general election. In
the city of Hulem tho vote wil probubly
total 70 or possibly 75 per cent of the
registration but in tho outlying districts

licans wero casting au overwhelming
majority of the votes today and the
democrats wero strangely straggling
while tho progressives could oe counted
on a few fingers.
Hince there was no contest on the
democratic ticket there was nothing
draw the members of this party to the
polls but it was confidcnly predicted
by the "unterriiied few" who voted
that thero would bo more of them next
Tall.
In tho down town districts today nn
average of 51) per cent of the registered
republican strength had cast their bnl
lots this afternoon nnd it is expected
that the laboring men's vote will not
be cast until after working hours this
evening which will muke a grand clos
ing rush.
Tho election day is quiet in general
and no excitement is evident on the
streets. Tho women uro voting in larger
numbers than usual and few unregister
ed voters are being sworn in. Hince
only two freeholders aro required to
register a voter at the polls the process
is not as cumbersome ns in tho past and
it is comparatively easy to find the two
freeholders who are willing to swear in
the unregistered voter.
The main interest in the election is in
tho the raco between Ben W. Olcott nnd
Charles B. Moores for tho nomination
for secretary of state, whilo tho peo
ple 's choice for president takes second
placo In Btato politics. Thomns K.
Campbell and t red U. Huclitei, the can
didates for the republican nomination
for public service commissioner, are at
tracting considerable attention. While
Judge Percy R. Kelly is conceded the
republican nomination lor circuit judge
the race between George G. Bingham
and Myron E. Foguo for his running
mate promises to be close.
In county polities there is keen in
terest evident in the race for sheriff
and for district attorney. The multi
tude of candiihites for representative
to the legislature, for district attorney
and for school superintendent leaves
the result in the dark. In the city of
Hnlem tho contest for constable with its
eight entries and their partisans mnkes
it very much a "free-for-all" and the
first predictions on the outcome will bo
made tonight by the t apital Journal
when the counting of the ballots hns
progressed sufficiently to indicato the
outcome.
