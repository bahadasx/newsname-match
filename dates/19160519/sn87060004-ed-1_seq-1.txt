Capt. George W. Suesberry died
in Evansville, Ind., Saturday P. M.
at 9:80 in a hospital, where he was
taken when seriously overtaken by
illness. His death was due to a com
plication of ailments.
He was born in Breckenridge Co.
Ky Feb. 11, 18?1, and at the time
of his death was 85 years, 3 months
and 1 1 days old, When 4 small boy
he came to Illinois and lived in Ran
dolph. County until 1800.
Up until, about five weeks ago he
was enjoying his usual health. He.
seemed to' realize that this was his
last illness and told of many things
lie wished done in case he should die.
For about 20 years Capt. Sues
berry had resided in Mt. Vernon and
he was a man who stood high in the
estimation of his fellow men. He
was regarded as one of God's noble
men and one who was not afraid to
stand up for the right in spite of the
opposition that might be brought
abput.
In church work he was very active
and for 25 years was superintendent
of the Methodist Sunday school in
Steeleville. His membership was in
the Methodist church. His life had
been so lived that men honored and
revered him; it had been so lived that
Tj." " .Tti'i. " '"1 i fH
ii win uc an.exampie 10 mose wnn
jWhom he was associated; it had been
so lived as to establish an assurance
that what he did was right so far as
he knew.
Capt. Suesberry commanded Co.
K. of the 13th Illinois cavalry, and
he was one of the best soldiers in the
service of his country. His comrades
speak in glowing terms of his active
service and the mannerm which he
treated his men. He belonged to
Coleman Post, G, A. R. of this city.
During recent years he spent his
winters with a daughter who resided
in Kentucky, but alwaysseemed glad
to get back to Mt. Vernon among the
people he had so learned to love and
who so loved him.
At the close of the war Capt Sues
berry returned to Steeleville, where
he was actively engaged in merchan
dising for a number of years.
He was married three times, his
last wife being Miss. Rachel Tindall,
of Steeleville. Two daughters. Miss
Nannie Suesberry, and Mrs W. E
Martin,' of Evansville, survive the
union. Three children died in in
fancy. His last wife preceded him
to the grave 15 years ago.
The funeral was conducted with
military honors at Steeleville today,
the body being taken there on the
Wabash train this morning.

CALOMEL DYNAMITES
A SLUGGISH LIVER
Crashes into Sour Bile, Mak
ing You Sick and You Lose
a Day's Work
Calomel salivates I It's mer
cury, ualomel acts nice dyna
mite on a slugcish liver. When
calomel comes into contact with
sour bile it crashes into it, caus-
ng cramping and nausea.
If you feel biliou, headachy,
constipated and all knocked out,
just go to your druggist and get
50 cent bottle of Dodson's
Liver, Tone, which is a harmless
vegetable substitute for danger
ous calomel. Take a spoonful
and if it doesn't start your liver
and straighten you up better and
quicker than nasty calomel and
without making yon sick, you
jnst go back and get your money.
If you take calomel today
von'Il bo sick and nauseated to
morrow; besides, it may salivate
you, while if you take Dodson's
Liver Tone you will wake up
feeling great, full of ambition
and ready for work or play. It's
harmless, pleasant and safe to
give to children; they like it.
