BERLIN, (via wireless to Tucker
ta, N. J.) May 19.—There Is a feel
hg here that If a strong neutral, such
a the United States, undertook to
negotiate peace, It might succeed.
Diplomatic circles regard the re
cent statements of President Polncare
and Sir Edward Grey as the opening
guns in an Informal discussion of
peace, though the expressions from
the allied leaders, when ranged along
side the German chancellor's recent
reicbstag speech, do not appear alto
gether conciliatory.
[Note:—The above dispatch Is
jrobably the most frank discussion of
feace rumors In circulation In Euro
tan capitals yet passed bjr .the Qer
fcn censor]
!Xo
decision has been reaohed here
0 to whether any official reply to
tiese statements will be made public
by the German government, though It
la possible this will be done. One
official with whom 1 talked today de
clared that making peace at this stage
of the war would be no more difficult
than adjusting the recent German
American submarine dispute. He
pointed out, however, that no bellig
erent can publicly state definite terms
of peace, while Informal discussions
continue with each side making dras
tic statements of what it intends to
accomplish as the result of the war.
I have just returned from a visit
to Holland, where I found that Dutch
men believe the English, French and
German people all desire peace. The
general impression in Holland la that
the time for a decisive victory for
either side has passed, although each
of the belligerents may attempt a
Bummer offensive. The Dutch think
it Is America's duty to act now and
that the time is ripe to bripg the bel
ligerents together. One diplomat said
that if the peace talk now in circu
lation continues for a few months,
the belligerents will learn enough of
what each side wants, to bring them
together in a peace agreement by
October.
The general impression prevails in
Holland that Premier Asquith and
Chancellor Von Bethmann-Hoilweg
Might make peace, but that the Kitch

with President Poincare of France, are

ers declare that one reason England
does not want peace now is because
she believes that German submarines
oannot behave and as Ions as the
possibility of the United States
breaking off relations with Ger
many exists, England would be fool
ish to make peace. The Dutch, how
I ever, regard this as only an excuse
set up by that group In England
which wants a continuation of war.
The Hollanders are outspoken in their
regard for America, considering the
United States their best friends. They
desire that the United States lead
the -way for peace, feeling that it is
6ur duty to end the bloodshed.
To my surprise, some Hollanders
asked me when the German people
are going to start a revolution be
cause of the food situation.
Although meat is scarce although
the shortage may increase, the pro
posed new governmeht bureau to
regulate the sale of meat .in Germany
will provide liveable rations and pre
vent food demonstrations. So far
there is no indication that any demon
strations at all equalling the Irish
uprising are likely to occur.

FBTROGRAD, May 19.—"The al

They intend to break Germany's
heavy sword. They owe this to un
born generations."
This was the answer to peace talk
from Berlin made to the United Press
today by Rene Viviani, former French
prime minister, and now minister of
justice in the Frenoh cabinet. Viviani
has been making extensive visits to
ISngiand and Russia. At the French
embassy he gave the second inter
view he has granted since the war
began, the previous interview having
been given the United Press at
Paris during his premiership.
"I am not qualified to speak of
Germany's intentions," continued the
French cabinet official, "but our al

threatened to kill herself and will
contend Orpet hastened to Helms

prevent her suicide.
The defense, it. was indicated In
questioning of jurors today, will ask
that Orpet's relations with Marian
previous to her death be overlooked
by the Jurors. Bach prospect was
asked this question:
"If you are accepted as a juror, are
you willing to put aside the thought
of any relations the defendant had
with the deceased girl, no matter how

him the presumption of innocence at

The defense will emphasize that

Marian was a boyish folly.

Birrell'a Excuses.
LONDON, May 19.—Late in March,
Augustine Blrrell, former chief secre
tary for Ireland, asked Lord Kitch

er of the home forces to send more
troops to Ireland because he was
"nervous" about the situation in Dub

they had no troops to spare.
This was the direct answer today
to the charge that his laxness was re
sponsible for outbreaks in the Irish
capital. He was testifying before the
royal committee appointed to Investi
gate the outbreaks.
Birrill said the defiant attitude of
the Ulsterites undoubtedly encouraged
the rest of Ireland to revolt. The
Ulster provisional government, he
said, encouraged gun running and
made plans for warfare In Belfast
with all the pomp and ceremony of a
rebellion.
"This affected those inclined to be
disloyal elsewhere," he said. "Cath

Ulsterites were allowed to do, they
could do. If home rule had not pass-

Ireland.
"But," he added, caustically, "so
far as any results were concerned, a
