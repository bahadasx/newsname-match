"The official Italian reports of May

order to diminish the impression made
by the Italian retreat The losses of the
enemy can be estimated only by those
who hold the battlefield. The Italians
are not in that position
"The Austro-Hungarlans. while ap
preciating at full value the sacrifice of
every brave soldier, are able to declare
that the Austrd-IIungarian losses have
been exceedingly small, thanks to the
ability of the infantry, the powerful

The Austrian offensive south and

These gains have been made in the fare

as much as 4000 feet within a mile. Dis

to the superiority of the artillery,

NOT CI U
That He Wandered Over the Mexican Line Unwitting

MYSTERY surrounds the death of members of the hospital corps on thelt

machine gun platoon of the
23rd infantry, whose body pierced by
three bullet holes, was brought to the
base hospital at Ft. Bliss, Thursday
afternoon from a point near a small
adobe house on the "island," between
monuments one and two, in the lower
section of El Paso, marking the inter-
I national boundary line.
Although a number of theories have
been advanced, it is generally believed
that tbe young officer was shot down
on the Mexican side of the line which
he had unwittingly crossed while pur
suing a number of mules that had es
caped from the corral of the machine
gun platoon some time previous, and
gone in the direction of the interna
tional line.
The exact time of the shooting Is un
known. As near as can be estimated
the tragedy occurred about 10:15
oclock. although It was not reported
to the military authorities In Juarez
until two hours later. They in return
notified Brig. Gen. George Bell at Ft.
Bliss, and an ambulance squad was

"The world conditions of the past
two years have confirmed the belief,

that arbitral and judicial methods

in settling international disputes.
'During the 20th century the per

upon enses involving questions relat

of the Pacific and the three Americas.
These questions involved financial and
territorial claims and such fundamen

national flag and to exercise Jurisdic

These facts are clear testimony to the
development of arbitration

A. Mexican guard named tiallardo Is
under arrest in Juarez, pending in

morning of Srgt. Harry Furman, ma
chine gun company of the 23d infantry.
While several Mexican guards were
present on the strip of land known as
"the island" when the killing took
placet they all assert that but one man
did the shooting, and he is being held.
The man asserts that when Srgt. Fur
man rode over the line onto Mexican
soil, he grasped the bridle of the Amer
ican's horse to stop him. whereupon
the sergeant drew bis revolver and be
gan to fire. The Mexican says he shot
in self defence The revolver of the
sergeant with two chambers dis
charged is offered in evidence.
The sergeant was out with the ma
chine gun company at drill on a piece
of land that adjoins a small piece of
Mexican territory on the American side
of the Rio Grande When the mules
of the command got away, he started
in search of tbem and accidentally got
