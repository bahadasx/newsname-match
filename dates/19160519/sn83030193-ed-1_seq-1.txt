Mrs. MacMechen Accuses
Woman Dirigible Expert of

HAD SECRET AIR PLANS.
Mrs. Andrews and I le Tried to
Sell Them to the British,
Witnesses Say.
How Mrs. Alice Andrews, wealthy
Canadian society woman and avia
tion expert, in her eagerness to fur
nish the llrltish Admiralty with se-
i
I
cret plans for building dirigibles, It
Is charged, formed an alliance ith
Tiiomas Rutherford MacMThen, In
ventor and former President of the
Aeronautical t-ociety of America,
which culminated iu the breaking tip
of his home, was told to-day In Jus
tice Glcgcrlch's part of the Supreme
Court In Mrs, MacMechen's eiilt for
divorce.
Neither Mr. MncMecbeu nor Mrs.
Andrews was In court. Mrs. Mac
Mechen hid her faco In her hands
during tho testimony. Miss Mary
Humphrey, daughter of United HUtes
District Judge Humphrey of Spring
field, III., and a niece of Mrs. Mac
Mechen, told of a confession she said
Mr. MacMechen madn to her. He ad
mitted, she said, Mrs. Andrews had
not only Infatuated him, but retained
a grip on him because she had In
her possesion dirigible plans and se.
epot .Jeslgns that, In some unexplained
manner, were taken from the tiles of
th German War Office.
Walter V. Kamp, a German, who is
said to be the only man In the United
States possessing a knowledge of the
intricacies of Zeppelin construction,
testified ho was a "loiiso" partner of
Mr. MacMechen. Ho said MacMechen
hud warned him to "keep away from
th" divorce suit lest he" (Kump) "get
Into trouble over the plans."
"Wha-t do you mean by 'loose part
ner?" " inquired Justice Glegerlch.
"Why, Mr. MacMechen was to take
our plans td England, present them
to th Admiralty and If they were ac
cepted wo wero to divide the profits."
replied Kamp.
"In December, 1915," said Mrs.
Humphrey, who Is holrets to more
than Il.000.0u0, "Mr. MacMechen
aked me If his wito had told me of
their troubles. I told him .she hud
nut, and then he explained they had
not been very happy togother, Kor
many eurs, Mr. MacMechen told me,
ho had litwn greatly bothered by
women who InslMod upon forcing
their attentions upon him. It was
not his fault, he said, because, women
wero nlwaya Interested In him and ho
said he thought It would be hard for
Mrs. MacMechen to understand that
the women and uot he, wero reapousl
bio for all tne trouble.
"Three days out on a steamer bound
for London, be told me, he met Mrs.
Andrews. He told her about his In
terest In uvlatlon, and she explained
she was Just as deeply Interested and
was going to the Admiralty Office
with plans. 'Prom that time on,' Mr,
MacMechsm told me, 'Mrs, Andrews
and 1 were constantly together, ills.

"I simply want to add to what tho
