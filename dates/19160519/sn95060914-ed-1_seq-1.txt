COMPARATIVE DATA
nh
E
TAXATION
Commissioners Plan Gives
Better Results Than Spec
ial Mine Tax Bill
MINING COMPANIES ARE FAIR
Quack Tax Doctors Should
Lay Off in Next Session
of Legislature
editor Guardian The Tax
Commission has been requested on
numerous occasions to give to the
public data and information rela
tive to the taxable valuation of the
productive mines of the State under
the plan adopted for the assessment
of the same by the Commission as
well as the valuation that would
have been shown under the provis
ions of the proposed mine tax law
Previous to this the Commission
has not deemed it advisable to agi
tate a question that had apparently
been amicably settled in a manner
supposedly satisfactory to all con
cerned
However it appears from inter
views furnished the daily press by
some of the prominent politicians of
the State that some of them as
sume that mine tax legislation will
again be an issue in the forthcom
ing political campaign
If this assumption is correct and
well founded it will doubtless be of
some interest to taxpayers to know
comparative facts and figures as to
what the valuation of the produc
tive mines would have been had the
so called Bacon Special Privilege
Mine Tax Bill become a law
This bill provided that the pro
ducing mines of the State be valued
for purposes of taxation at a sum
equal to four 4 times their net
proceeds plus twelve and one half
l2Jf per centof their gross pro
ceeds of the previous year after all
expenditures in connection with the
development and operation of the
mines had been deducted The ex
penditures above set forth were not
subject to review or correction by
any assessonal authority
The Tax Commission took the po
sition then and still holds that un
der the ad valorem system of taxa
tion no class of property is entitled
to a privilege that cannot be ac
corded all other classes This po
sition is not founded on a spirit of
antagonism toward the producing
mines of the State but rather
tiom a disposition to be absolutely
fair and impartial to all of the dif
ferent classes of property that must
of necessity submit to being valued
and assessed by some assessing au
thority
The producing mines of
the State were valued
and assessed by the
Tax Commission for
the year 1915 not in
cluding personal prop
erty at 11802600374
The actual net of all
producing mines in the
State as reported to
the Tax Commission
for the year pre
vious 1914 was
The toUil gross for
same period was
Four times the above
net plus twelve and
one half per cent of
gross proceeds equals
the total of the pro
ducing mines of Ari
zona under proposed
law
1579606032
5394452610
6992730705
the actual assessment
leaves a deficiency of
valuation under Pro
posed Mine Tax Bill
of 4809S69669
It will thus be seen that under
th p vi ion of the Special Mine
Tax Bil in m auai n of all
ol the p oduemg mines of the
State w u d have oern slightly un
iei 70000000 for the year 1915

ment actually placed on the same
