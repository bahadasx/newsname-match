THAT RAILROAD SURVEY
UP THE ICICLE RIVER
Story Sent Out From Wenatchee May Be
Premture But is Almost
Sure to Materialize
This is not the first time the people
of Leavenworth had to go away from
home to learn the news. It will be re
called that The Echo made some refer
ence to the probability of a railroad be
ing built up the Icicle river canyon in
January last. The plans were then un
der consideration and being matured.
No reference has since been made to
the matter for the reason that we want
ed definite, positive assurance that the
project would be undertaken before
making the announcement. It has
always been the policy of this paper to
avoid making misleading statements
and peddling hot air to its readers. It
is enough at this time to say that the
survey of a railroad up the Icicle river
from Leavenworth has not yet began.
Tho it may begin any day. We hope
to make definite announcement next
week as to when it will begin and, if at
all, such other information as will be of
interest to readers of this paper.
The probability of the building of
the road rests on the existence of a
valuable body of ore, principally copper
bearing, on which between fifty and
one hundred thousand dollars worth of
development work has been done in
the past twenty-odd years by Al Van
Epps. So much exploration work has
been done on the property that it is
practical at this time for a mining ex
pert to determine the amount of ore
that can be taken out, and by assay de
termine the value per ton. So that it
only remains to be determined that the
yalne above the cost of mining, trans
portation and smelting leaves a margin
of profit large enough to attract capital,
and we understand the result has been
quite satisfactory. With the high price
of metal, which promises to continue
for years, there seems to be sound
reason for believing that the Van Epps
property will come into the producing
class in a short time.
GOOD ROADS REQUIRE
STUDY AND INVESTIGATION
What Se«B an Expensive Road is Often
the Cheapest in the End
One'ol the reasons why after long
experience in road building so little is
known about the best methods of road
construction is that Americans are not
a studious nation. That was the con
clusion submitted by W. H. Reed, of
Tacoma, president of the state associa
tion of county commissioners, at the
recent Road Builders' Institute at the
university.
Also, Americans are too eager to
put a new road into use, he said.
They will not wait until its surface is
dried and hardened on a settled foun
dation. Mr. Reed seconded the ad
vocacy of concrete pavement to the
extent of saying thai Pierce county
had received more value from that sort
than from any other hard surface.
Concrete roads necessarily cost more
than others but it has long since
proved its superiority over other pav
ing when properly done and in the end
is the cheapest, particularly where it is
subjected to heavy traffic, or is ex
posed to inundation in the spring. In
every way it resists the effect of water
better than other road material.
Two Seven-Ton Motors for Saw Mills
Two seven-ton motors were unload
ed here Monday. One intended for
the Leavenworth Lumber Co. and the
other for the Peshastin Lumber Co.
They will be used in drawing logs and
lumber tracks. The Peshastin Lum
ber Co. last week began the installa
tion of a new and larger boiler in their
mill. This company already has a
heavy lumber auto track and a cater
pillar logging truck and with the addi
tion of gasoline engine received this
week will be the best equipped mill in
this section.

COMMENCEMENT EXERCISES
LEAYENWORTH'S SCHOOL
Every Seat in Scenic Theatre Occupied-
Two Hundred Failed to Get In—
Excellent Program
The commencement exercises of the
Leavenworth High School, which were
held last Friday evening in the Scenic
theatre, showed the keen interest that
is taken in the mental development of
our rising generation. A few minutes
after the doors were opened both the
seating and standing capacity of the
theatre was entirely filled, so much so
that many who were desirous of being
present had to go away disappointed.
The salutatory, "Our School," was
well rendered by Gladys West, and
showed a mind that will be capable of
greater achievements thru the various
stages of life.
The valedictory fell to the lot of
Donald Mclntosh, who chose for his
theme, "Our Wars." In a clear and
concise manner he led his audience
on thru our wars with England, down
thru the civil war, thence to Manila
Bay, ending by reminding his hearers
that the position of the stars and stripes
floating over an unbeaten field, might
some day in the near future become
untenable unless better provision was
made for their protection.
An eloquent and stirring address was
given by Professor Wellington Pe?g,
of Wenatchee, on the reconstruction of
the present physical, moral and social
destruction of the world, pointing out
to the students that on their shoulders
is to fall the responsibility of that re
construction which is going to place
the world on a solid highway and per
manent peace and prosperity, or to put
it on a plane that would lead to a
moral and social chaos such as the
world experienced in the dark ages.
All of those who took part in the
program showed that the years of study
had not been lost on them.
The high school chorus, a quartet,
and several songs rendered by the
pupils were highly appreciated.
At the close Mr. Motteler, president
of the school board, in a few appropri
ate remarks presented the pupils with
their diplomas.
Rainier Restaurant Will Enlarge

new addition will be used as a dining
room and the old room for a lunch
counter exclusively. The front in the
new dining room will be solid glass
and will present an open view down
east Front street. Mr. O'Rourke says
he will have the most attractive dining
room in Leavenworth.
Addition to Wenatchee Law Firm
The Wenatchee World announced
the first of this week that the firm of
Hughes & Adams had taken into part

hereafter the style of the firm would be
Hughes, Sumner & Adams, and would
occupy the offices of the old firm in
the Columbia Valley Bank building.
This makes a good strong legal com
bination and the firm will take rank
among the strongest in the county seat
town.

DOUBLE TRACKING THE
GREAT NORTHERN R. R.
Guthrie & Co. Said to Have Secured Con
tract-To be Completed by the
End of the Year
The story primed in the daily press
the past week to the effect that the
Great Northern railroad company would
double track its road between Leaven
worth and Wenatchee lacks confirma
tion so far as we are able to trace the
matter. There had been rumors in
the air for the past two weeks about
some double tracking to be done on
the G. N., but careful inquiry failed to
confirm the report at this end of the
line. Railroad men here say that if
the road between Leavenworth and
WenaUhee is double tracked the dou
ble track will be continued as far as the
Columbia river, as that is the least ex
pensive part of the route. There are
no bridges and the rock work on that
stretch of road is not expensive, while
the necessity for double tracking be
tween Wenatchee and the Columbia
river, where the Douglas branch taps
the main line, is equally as important
and necessary as between Leavenworth
and Wenatchee.
About the double tracking no one
can tell, the railroad company and its
ways are much like the ways of the
"Heathen Chinee." Every one up
this way hopes that the work may go
on aud begin at once.

If you have ten or more cows you
need a silo. To furnish succulent feed
for winter and during the period of
short pasture in summer is of the great
est importance in the economical pro
duction of milk.
The feeding of silage will not only
increase the milk yield over that se
cured by dry feeding, but will in most
cases lessen the cost of feeding and
keep the herd in better health.
The milk yield always drops ofi rap
idly during the dry season unless the
cows are supplied some food in addi
tion to pasture. Silage furnishes an
excellent supplement to short pasture,
and if fed as soon as the pasture begins
to fail the milk yield will be main-

EDISON IS FOR ROOSEVELT
Great American Genius Says T. R. "Only
Man for Next President"
Thomas A. Edison, who was appoint
ed chairman of the naval consulting
board by Secretary of the Navy Daniels,
has sent a letter to the Roosevelt Non
partisan League in which he states that
Colonel Roosevelt "is absolutely the
only roan who should be considered as
the next president of the United
States."
Mr. Edison's unofficial connection
with the government, coupled with the
fact that he is a close friend of Henry
Ford, has caused a stir in political cir
cles.
"He has more real statesmanship, a
better grasp of the most important
needs of this country and greater ex
ecutive ability to handle the big inter
national problems that will arise at the
close of the war than all the other
candidates put together," Edison says
of Roosevelt.

to Build a Silo
tamed. Silage will be found a valuable
feed for wintering beef cattle.
To give best results the silo must be
well built with an airtight wall and of
the proper size for the herd. The silo
should be of such a diameter that the
herd will consume each day a layer of
silage two inches in depth. In sum
mer feeding it is often necessary to use
three inches iv depth per day. Where
a silo of two large diameter is used the
silage is not fed fast enough to keep it
fresh, consequently the air penetrates
*he surface to a depth of four or five
inches and spoiled silage is being fed
all the time.
The following table shows the size of
silo to use for different rrerds:

the silo in June with wheat or other
small grain to be used for summer
silage, then refill with corn in the fall

BAD FREIGHT WRECK
ON GREAT NORTHERN
Near Soap Lake, Wednesday Morning-
Track Men Blundered in Removing
Rail Without Giving Warning
One of the worst freight wrecks that
has occurred on the Great Northern in
a long time took place west of Ephrata,
near Soap Lake station, Wednesday
morning about nine o'clock, when an
east-bound freight train of seventy-odd
cars drawn by one of the big Mallette
engines went off the track and piled
some fifteen cars, partly covering the
engine. Cars of oil which were in the
wreckage took fire and some fifteen
loaded cars and the engine were de
stroyed. The train crew blew up sev
eral cars with dynamite to break the
contact and thus saved the balance of
the train.
The wreck was caused by the track
repair men having removed rails and
failed to put up a warning sign as the
rules provide. Fortunately no one was
hurt. The engine men having had
time to jump.
The arrival of trains No. 1, due here
at 2 a. m. and 43 due at 3:45 was de
layed eleven hours. In the destruc
tion of property and loss to the com
pany the amount will figure up over a
hundred thousand dollars. The en
gine, which was covered with oil and
wreckage, is declared by railroad men
to be a total wreck, the heat having
bent and twisted the iron out of shape.
"BUSINESS CHRONICLE"
SEATTLE'S NLW TRADE PAPER
Hugh E. Agnew, for Three Years Con
nected with Washington's School
of Journalism
Hugh E. Agnew, who for the past
three years has been instructor in ad
vertising and marketing at the Univer
sity of Washington School of Journal
ism, has resigned to become associate
editor of the Business Chronicle, the
new paper of which Edwin Selvin is
editor.
Beginning as a newsboy, Professor
Agnew has had a varied experience
with the publishing business. He was
business manager of the college paper
and the college annual, for six years
editor of the Dowagiac (Michigan) Re
publican, four years manager of the
Chamberlain Printing Co., a mail order
concern which printed the trade pa
pers, "Home" and "Service," and
manager of the Canton (Illinois) Daily
Ledger from 1911 to 1913, where he
built up a circulation of 5,000 m a
city of 15,000 people. Mr. Agnew
left Canton to go to Oklahoma, but not
liking that country, came to Seattle
and became a member of the faculty
of the University.
Since that time Professor Agnew has
been a frequent contributor to maga
zines devoted to advertising and sell
ing. "Printer's Ink," "The Publish
ers' Gide," "American Printer," the
"Keystone," "The Jewelrvmens' Jour
nal," "The Hardware Dealers' Mag
azine," and "Hardware World" being
among the leading magazines to which
he has contributed.
Professor Agnew has been a frequent
speaker before conventions of retail
dealers of the slate, and last year was
on the program of the national con
vention of the teachers of advertising
and has been invited to speak again
this year at Philadelphia before the
same association. He is chairman of
the committee of publicity of that or
ganization.
Since coming to the city Mr. Agnew
has been an active member of the Se
attle Ad Club, of which he is now sec
retary and chairman of the vigilance
committee, and is regarded as an au
thority on vigilance work.

BUDGET Of STATE NEWS
Capt. I. M. Howell, secretary of
state, issued an announcement of his
candidacy for re-election to that office,
together with a brief statement of the
manner in which he has administered
his duties during the period, nearly
eight years, that he has filled the posi
tion. There is at present no indica
tion that he will have any serious op
position for the Republican nomination,
which will be equivalent to re-election.
Four years ago he was elected by the
largest majority of any state candidate.
Captain Howell has lived in this state
since territorial days is married and
the head of a family.
Governor Lister last week wrote the
final chapter on the Industrial Insur
ance frauds, and the charge of petty
graft against some members of the In
dustrial Insurance Commission, by ac
cepting the resignation of Commis
sioner Parker and demanding those of
Commissioners Daggett and Ernst.
Thus the board is swept clean and a
completely new commission will take
office June first. The new members
are E. W. Olson, formerly labor com
missioner, John M. Wilson, now assis
tant attorney general, and F. I. Gill, a
deputy bank examiner. All of the
new members thus are transferred from
other state payrolls. Two are demo
crats while Wilson is a republican.
Judge Clifford, of Tacoraa, rendered
an important decision last week in the
case ol a barber shop which wajpick
eted by the Barbers' Union for hiring
non-union men. The court granted
an injunction against the union pick
ets, restraining them from all offensive
acts against the shop, and allowed
nominal damages to the proprietor of
the shop, taxing the costs of the suit
against the union. The case is of
especial interest because the state-wide
antipicketing law is to be voted on in
November. Judge Clifford's decission
is in accord with the spirit of that law,
altho the court relied entirely on the
general principle that the union pick
ets were illegally damaging the prop
erty, regardless of any statute in the
matter.
Mayor Gill, of Seattle, ordered the
corporation council to draft a city ordi
nance which will make it a misde
meanor to buy liquor as we.l as sell it.
This new phase of the dry law will
arouse much interest all over the state,
where blind pigs are flourishing in
every other drug store. The irrepress
ible Hi Gill is doing more toward en
forcing the dry law than any man in
the state, altho he admits that he
voted against it. "Its the law now,"
and so long as its up to me to enforce
it there wont be any half way enforce
ment." Hence he wants an ordinance
that will make it illegal to buy liquor
from a blind pig. The purchaser can
be arrested, and punished, or com
pelled to testify against the party he
bought from. The present difficulty
in enforcing the law here is that the
drinkers have no respect for it, and
will not tell where they get their bot
tles. Drunkenness is on the increase
but arresting the unfortunates and
keeping them in jail to sober up
doesnt even give a clew as to where
they secure the liquor, nor does it help
in the difficult job of convicting the
sellers.
