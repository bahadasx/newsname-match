EXPLOSION IS
CAUSE OF MUCH
EXCITEHT
REMEMBRANCE OF GREAT DISAS
TER CAUSED NOONDAY SHOP
PERS TO MAKE HASTY RE
TREAT FROM SCENE.
At the noon hour downtown shop
pers were startled by a heavy report
at the corner of Mill and East Main
streets, underneath the Randol build
ing, occupied by Henry Damn's store.
A terrific report was followed by a
cloud of dust, but upon investigation
it was found to be nothing serious,
after all, as none of the plate glass
windows were shattered.
The cause of the explosion, accord
ing to the chief of the fire department
was escaping gas, and after the ex
citement had subsided and the slight
blaze underneath the building had
been extinguished, he ordered the gas
company to make a thorough investi
gation to determine whether the ex-
j plosion was caused from defective
equipment or from escaping sewer
gas.
The fire chief made a thorough in
spection of the building, and found
that it was not injured by the ex
plosion other than the floor in some
places had been slightly raised.
Explosions of any kind are not
popular in Ardmore since the great
disaster, and the building inspector
and chief of the fire department are
bending every effort to see that ev
ery possible hazard is eliminated.

nesday. GROUND BROKEN TODAY FOR A
FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR
HOME BY B. A. SIMPSON OF JHE
GATES COMPANY.
What will be the handsomest home
in Ardmore when completed, was be
gun this morning. It is being built by
B. A. Simpson on the site of his for
mer home at No. 103 G street south
west. .The old heme has been moved
some distance west, and the brick
piers are being placed under it today.
It will be occupied by the family while
the new home is under construction.
Russell Brown & Company of Fort
Worth, and Daniel Walling of Hous
ton, Texas, have the contract to do
the drawing, the superintending and
the construction work, and a large
crew of workmen began this morning.
The location is one of the prettiest in
the city, it is located on an eminence
iu the southwest portion of the city,
'the lot is a large corner location front-
! ing the east, and there never was a
more desirable location for a per
manent home. What the building will
cost when completed, is not known,
but it will be in the neighborhood of
$40,000, and when completed will be
the handsomest structure in the city.
Mr. Simpson has been fortunate in
his oil investments and the money that
he made in the fields is being spent in
Ardmore. Besides the building of
this handsome home he has purchased
a southwest addition to the cityand
has also made the purchase of one of
the best corner pieces of property on
Main street in the heart of the busi
ness district, and the chances are good
that he will break dirt some of these
days for the finest office building in
the city, and if he does put up such
a building there will not be a better
nor a "more modern structure in the
state than the one be will build.

DR. WILLIAMS SPOKE LAST NIGHT
FROM LEVITICUS 17:11, "THE
BLOOD OF THE ATONEMENT"
TONIGHT, "THE LOST COIN."
Dr. Williams' sermon last night at
the tabernacles was based on Leviti
cus 17:11. Through disobedience
spiritual death came upon Adam and
Eve. Tills death was separation from
the source of life, separation from
God. In place of holy fellowship
with their father, conscious guilt and
condemnation came. They discerned
this separation and also the ir naked
ness. They sought to cover their
nakedness with aprons woven from
fig leaves. So man litis always been
trying to cover his guilt before God
with his own works or philosophy.
God covered Adam and Eve with the
skins of slain animals. Blood was
shed to do it, and this is the first
account of the shedding of blood giv
en in the Bible. The blood is the
life, it is liquid life, life in solution.
Much of our hymnology needs Inter
pretation, especially where it refers
to the blood. It is meaningless or
misleading to those who are unac
quainted with its scriptural, Christian
spiritual significance. The giving of
the blood is the giving of the life,
pouring it out, in service and ex
treme sacrifice as with Christ upon
the cross. He gave everything, even
life itself. The departure of the Jews
from Egypt was under the sign of
the shed blood of the pascal lamb.
Christ is the lamb of God. The Jew
who would be saved from the destroy
ing angel must co-operate with God
on that eventful night. He must
comply with the divine requirements
Ify faith and obedience one man
fulfilled the human side of the com
mands and was saveJ. Another man
by unbelief and disobedience failed to
meet the divine requirements and his
home was smitten by the angel of
death. Today church membership is
only the sign of salvation, it is a
call for help. We must love God to
live. This is always true .
There Is a beautiful story that a
Jewish maiden called Mary asked
her father on the night of the Pass
over if the blood was sprinkled on
the door. He tried to quiet her
fears. But she could not sleep be
cause she was the first born, and if
the blood was not applied as God re
quired she was to die that night. She
kept insisting until her father lifted
her from the bed and carried her to
the door, when lo! the blood was
not on the door. In haste he hurried
to his neighbor to secure the blood.
Scarcely had he applied it when the
whirr of the angel's wings were heard
pasing over the streets of the city.
This important matter had bean neg
lected or entrusted to another who
was careless. Here the child helped
her father to do his duty and save his
! child. Many rarents are neither will-

B. A. Simpson of this city has pur
chased 330 lots in the southwest por

posed of J. F. McClatchey of this
city, W. A. Ledbetter of Oklahoma
City and S. T. Bledsoe of Chicago. The
Lawyers Realty Company called their
land the Highland Park addition to
Ardmore. It is located along Stanley
Boulevard and Is In the most favored
residence section of the city. It is not
known to what use Mr. Simpson will
put the property, but those who know
him best state that he will make a
beauty spot out of the tract. The con
sideration is not stated, but in as much,
as the property is so well located It is
reasonable to presume that the prop
erty brought a fairly good price.

NO MORE FREE PAPERS
A great many people do not
consider that they are asking
anything unreasonable when
they call at the Ardmorelte of
fice and request the gift of a
paper. It would not be if wo
were only required to give the
one paper, but that is not the
case. There is not a day that
passes but we are asked for
extra papers for one reason or
another and every day from
five to twenty-five papers are
passed out for which there is
no return. The price of paper
on which the Ardmorelte is
printed costs now double what
it has cost heretofore, and we
are compelled to cut off every
item of waste that exists. Here
after every paper that goes out
of the Ardmoreite office will be
charged for. Do not feel hurt
if you are asked for the price oC
the paper, should you neglect to
tender the price.
