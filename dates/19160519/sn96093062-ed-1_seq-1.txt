A small but enthusiastic number
of fair fans mot Tuesday night at

Fair association, and cussed and dis

desired, hold tho fair. Datos had
previously boon agreed .upon as four

Within tho next few wockB, it la

TROOP TRAINS' THRU DURANT.
That tho trouble on the border be
tween tho United Stntcs and Mexico
Is not considered over by tho gov
ernment was evidenced very plainly
hero Suntlny when a number of
troop trains passed through onrouto
to San Antonio, Toxas. All the
trains wont over tho Katy and woro
carrying regulars of tho United
States army, and a largo amount of
equipment. All tho men appeared to
bo veterans, and tho trains woro cer
tainly loaded down with fighting
equipmOiit. Among the equipment
which was of interest to pooplo horo
who saw it Were tho armored motor
trucks, machine gups, and big field
pieces. A largo-amount of this kind
of equipment was carried and it
looked as If tho soldiers wero going
down for a long stay and to do some
real fighting before .their return.
Particulars concerning this troop
movement could not bo obtained, ox
copt that their first destination was
San Antonio.
KATY NEW TRAIN IN DITCH.
Katy train numbor sevon, the now
stleol train, duo to pass Durant at
9:35, was wrecked near Clinton, Mls
suorl, caused by a broken rail, in
juring twoWty-two passongors, two of
whom wore Oklahomans. Tho train
was making forty-flvo miles an hour
over a fill when the accident happen
ed, and the engine, tender and flvo
coaches wero derailed and turned
over on their Bides at tho bottom of
the embankment. All Injured savo
six wore able to extricate themselves
from the wreck. Had the train not
ben made up of all stoel coaches It
is thought that many - would havo
been killed.
PAVE GTH AVE
TO Si. NORMAL
Tetltion Likely to Bo Passed Among J
Property Owners of North Sixth
Avonuo In Neov Future. Improve
ment Needed.
Tho talk of paving Sixth avenuo
from Main street to tho Normal
-school grounds north of town, is
gaining 'ground very day and is
likely that a petition will be pass
ed among the owners of property on
hls street in a very few dayB. Al
ready a great many people interested
on tho street havo signified their
wiliingnss to pavo tho stroet, and it
Is thought certain that tho improve
ment will go thru if he petition rack
et is started.
This street from about Locust on
to tho Normal is in a horrible condi
tion, and well nigh impassible in wot
weather. In tho bottom near tho
creek, is fearful, and tho hundreds
of teachers and pupils of tho insti
tution aro forced to wade mud anklo
deep to get to and from school in tho
rainy season.
This condition is giving tho school
a sort of black oyo for tho reason that
out of town Btudonts realizing tho
condition hesitate to enroll in tho
local school, and there is no doubt
that the attendance is cut down on
this account.
The Stato Board of Education has
loft tho intimation that Durant ls ex
pected to improve this street during
ho coming summer, alhough no direct-request
to this effect has been
made either officially or othorwlso.
If tho improvement should not bo
made, the board naturally would not
go on with bany improvements and
enlargements, which aro contemplat
ed for tho blulding and campus.

LET CONTRACT
ON MAY 29TH
Many Didders Expected to Compote)
for Dig Main Street Job. Will Usa
tho Bituminous Asphalt. Street to
Bo 27 Feet Wide.
On Monday night May 29th tho
city council will let tho contract for
tho paving of Main Btreet from Fifth
avenue to tho city limits of Durant,
and judging by the interest already
bolng manifested it is ovidont that
competition for the job will bo keen.
There will probably bo at least ono
loyal man be on tho job, E. C. Baum,
who while working for another con
corn laid the prosont Main street
brick pavomont from the Katy to
Fifth avenuo.
The plans and specifications call
for a stoect 30 foet wide from lnnor
lino to inner lino of concreto curbs
of ""which width 27 foot shall bo bi
tuminous macadam. On cither sido
of macadam pavement will bo laid a
concerto gutter 18 Inches wide and
a concrete curb 6 inches In thick
noss. " There will bo laid a 4-Inch
foundation of crushed stone, upon
fv whore.ng guttrry cmfwyp p
which will be laid a 2-inch layer of
chats or other hard broken stone
that would pass on inch ring, with a
mixture of not less than thirty nor
moro than fifty per cent of ground
natural bituminous stone, enough be
ing used to thoroughly fill tho voids
In and bind tho hard broken stone,
and all rolled with a 10-ton roller un
til brought to a smooth, oven finish
of wearing surfaco an dleft to stand
twonty-four hours; then to be turnod
ovor for traffic.
The process that is to be used i3
patented and ls owned by J. S. Down
ard of Ar'dmoro who will receive a
royalty of twenty cents a square yard
for all pavement laid according to lite
plan.
Tho successful bidded will be re
quired to furnish the city bond in
tho sum of thirty percent of the con
tract price, to guarantee faithful
execution of contract, and a twenty
percent five year maintenance bond
to guarantee tho paving as regards
wear and tear for five years.
' In view of the. fact that the city
has proceeded this trip by petition
and not by resolution, it is hardly
probable that any slip will knock tho
deal, as has occurred In four former
occoslons. About seven-eights of tho
people on the street have signed the
petition, and aro anxious for tho im
provement to proceed at onco.
RIOUSLY HURT
IN BUGGY SMASH
Miss Beulah Emmort and Miss Susio
Cat and Mrs. M. E. Mnckoy Sus
tain Serious Dijurics When Buggy
Driven by Young Durham Upsets
Their Buggy.
Mrs. M. E. Mackey of this city,
MIs3 Susie Cat of Heavenor, and
Miss Beulah Emmert of Tallhlna,
wore all seriously Injured late Tues
day evening, in a collision between
their vehicle and a two horso rig
driven by a young son of Dr. Dur
ham, living east of tho city.
Miss Cat suffered a badly broken
elbow, which may result In perma
nent disability of tho arm. Miss
Emmert's head and face waB badly
lacerated and she received Internal
Inlurles. and Mrs. Mackey suffered a
bad cut over the left eye and a dis
located arm. Miss Mabel Curnutt of
Tallhlna. was injured. Tho buggy
aws upset and all the ladies pitched
forward violently to the pavement oy
tho collision. The three young ladles
were being taken to tho train by Mrs.
Mackey at tho tlmo 'the accident oc
curred. All wore given mdlcal aid,
and rmoved to the Mackey residence,
where they aro reported as doing
nicely.
Tho Mackey buggy a ono horao
rig was going south on Second and
made tho trun onto Main, just as
tho two horso buggy driven by U10
Durham boy was coming up Main to
the west.
Eye witnesses say that tho Dur
ham boy was driving rather fast,
wes too near tho middle of the street
and did not appear to bo watching
where ho was going. As tho Mackey
buggy took tho turn round tho post
in tho center of tho streot intersec
tion, tho other buggy crashed Into it,
tho tonguo catching tho rear wheel
and unsettlng tho buggy. Fortu-
naoly, none of tho horses mixed up
in tho wreck woro panicky, as a worse
smash up than ovor might havo resulted.
