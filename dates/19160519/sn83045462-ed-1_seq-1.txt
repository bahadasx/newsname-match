This report analyzes the join
and bases therein an earnest pro
legislation as that proposed in t
bill. It reads as follows:
To leave undone the things legislative
which ought not to be
done is as vitally important as to
do that which ought to be done.
I.
What legislation then should
not be enacted on the basis of the
report of the joint congressional
fiscal committee?
There should be (i) No repeal
outright of the half-and-half law
on the theory or in the belief that
the joint committee's report abolishes
it or. on the whole, recommends
its unconditional abolition.
.\o repeal ot tne nan-amihalf
law by rider on an appropriation
bill as proposed by such
amendment in the last Congress.
This amendment raised the issue
between House and Senate which
led to the creation of the joint
congressional committee. This
issue was whether the half-andhalf
law was fair to the nation.
The joint committee says it is
fair.
(3) No repeal of the halt-andhalf
law in any way which fails
to substitute for it a carefully
considered system under which
District taxation is fixed and certain,
and under which Congress
shall "pursue a definite policy of
regular and liberal appropriations"
for capital maintenance
and development.
(4) This substitute for the
half-and-half law, if one is proposed,
should be thoroughly discussed
by the District committees
and carefully considered by both
houses of Congress in order to bs
certain that it protects the capital's
equities and provides the
just safeguards against excessive
taxation which the half-and-half
law provides; and without this
thorough preliminary discussion
and consideration no repealing
substitute should be enacted.
No Repeal Urged by Committee.
The Joint committee was directed to
determine "the proper proportion of
the expenses of the government of the

be borne bjr said Dietrlct and the United

test to Congress against just such
he pending District appropriation
disclosed the utter impossibility of
measuring in terms of exact percentage
figures the relative capital obligations
of the District and of the United States
and of specifying conclusive reasons for
any precise percentage figures.
The committee, therefore, unable to
give to Congress exact proportionate
contribution fieur???a huckod Kt- c ?
. reasons, as directed, reported that
"there is no reason for any arbitrary
j rule of proportionate contribution for
J the expenses of the District of Celum'
bia by the residents thereof, and by
I the people of the l'nited States who
i reside outside of the District of Columbia.''
'
| The committee finds that the organic
1 act of 1878 "was conceived as an economI
ic necessity" and "was justified by the
exigencies of the time and the conditions
of that day," but that "the condij
tions of today and of the few years last
: past are so different from the conditions
? of 1878 that this arbitrary rule?a rule
' of then seeming necessity?need no
! longer be applied to District appropria'
tions."
I National Contribution Still Needed.
! What are the changes in conditions
j which cause the committee to think that
i an arbitrary half-and-half rule may not
i be necessary today?
j The committee indicates-these changes,
j The District had in 1878 less than half
' its present population, and was then
weighed down by a heavy burden of
i debt, which has now been largely paid.
! The District no longer needs, the com!
mittee thinks, to be compelled by la-v
| to bear its proper share of the burden.
i cn ine omer nana, xne national government,
the committee indicates, has since
1878 recognized "the splendid utility and
beauty of the city planned on a national
base;" it has erected many buildings
"of the very highest standard of architecture
" it has acquired more and more
land every year, holding it for strictly
I governmental purposes, and withdrawing
it from participation in assessment
and taxation; its "increasing needs *
in this, its central home, demand, and
will continue to demand, more land, more
buildings, more reservations" In other
words, the capital land holdings of the
nation and its reasonable pride in the
beautiful city which it has developed
have so increased since 1878 that the
compulsion of an arbitrary law is not
necessary -to cause the nation, through
Congress, tu bear half ?or m en more
| than half) the burden of capital upbuilding.
The committee does not find that the
capital no longer needs the national
I half contribution. On the contrary, the
i committee clearly indicates that the naI
tional half contribution is needed more
than ever, and should, if altered, be increased.
The need of more than a half
contribution by the nation is affirmed;
only the need of a law to compel at least
; this half-contribution is denied.
| In the last Congress, when the joint
congressional committee was created,
there was a struggle over the question
whether the half-and-half law should he
! killed as unfair or remain in force penij
ing the report of the joint committee
It was decided that it should remain
alive, and it is today unrepealed and in
full force and effect among our statutes.
If the half-and-half law had been repealed
at that time and the function of
the joint committee was to report a new
definite proportionate contribution for
adoption, very clearly the indefinite contribution
system would, in the light of
the committee's report, necessarily continue.
For the committee sees no reason
for any arbitrary proportion and is unable
to suggest any new figures. But
this law was not repealed, and the Joint
, committee's report, when analyzed, does
not recommend its unconditional repeal,
and is dt8ti""*tly hostile to every one of

FATE OF J. C. LYNCH
IKIN DOUBT
President Rushes Message to
London Ordering Effort to
Stay Execution.
CENSORSHIP MAY SCREEN
DEVELOPMENTS IN CASE
Not Known Whether Mr. Wilson's
Plea Arrived in Time to
Save American's Life.
NEW TORK. May 19.?The fate of
Jeremiah C. Lynch, an American citizen,
who was to have been shot at
daybreak in Dublin, Is believed to be
screened by strict censorship. No word
regarding the man who had been convicted
of complicity in the Irish rebellion
had come over the cables up to
9 o'clock this morning:. ,
President Wilson made an eleventhhour
plea for a stay of execution just
before midnigrht last night in Wash
ington. Owing: to ine ainerent-c si*
time Lynch was to have f-ced the firing
squad about three hours after
President Wilson hd directed that a
cable be sent to London asking that
the execution be deferred until the
American government make an investigation
into the ca3e.
Tl is not known here whether President
Wilson's plea reached the English
authorities in time to save Lynch from
being executed.
Report on the Trial
of Lynch Is Received
at State Department
A report on the trial of Jeremiah C.
Lynch from the American consul at
Dublin, dated yesterday, was received
at the State Department today from
Ambassador Page at London. It said
Lynch was tried yesterday by a field
cod rt- martial.
An apparent omission in the coded
message made its interpretation uncertain
to State Department officials.
It was suggested, however, that Lynch
was to have been either sentenced or
executed at daybreak today.
Secretary Lansing's message intervening
in Lynch's behalf apparently
had not been received by Ambassador
Page whence forwarded his report.
President Acts at Theater.
President Wilson last night made an
euun i>-? pueipune mc BIIWIUIK UI i^ynui
by sending a. message through the State
Department to Ambassador Page, directing
the latter to tAlce every possible step
to obtain delay. Senator O'Gorman went
to the White House last night to make an
appeal for Lynch. The President was at
the theater with Mrs. Wilson, but Secretary
Tumulty hastened to the theater
and called the President out for a conference.
The President acted promptly
in giving orders to the State Department.
SENATOR WORKS PLANS
10 OPPOSED. C. BILL
Says It Does Not Meet Requirements
of Joint Select Committee's
Report.
"The District appropriation bill as
framed by the Douse committee does
'not at all meet the requirements of the
jreport of the Joint select committee of
'Congress on the fiscal relations bejtween
the District and the United
j States in my opinion,'' said Senator
! Works of California, a member of the
j joint select committee, commenting upon
'the measure today.
"The House bill puts the burden of
{caring for the National Capital upon
! the residents of the District of CoI
lumbia. My belief is that the burden
j should he placed upon the federal govlernment.
and that when the residents
'of the District had paid a fair tax
upon their property here that was all
that was to be expected of them. I
1 intend to combat the bill with all the
i power 1 can if it comes to the Senate
carrying its present provision for paying
the expenses of the capital."
Called a "Bad Bill/'
Senator Gallinger of New Hampshire,
who was for many years chairman of
the Senate District committee while
the republicans were in power, pro|
nounced the House bill a "bad bill." He 1
|is a member of the subcommittee of the
Senate appropriations committee which
will have tne District bill in charge
when It reache? the Senate.
Senator Chilton of West Virginia,
chairman of the Joint select committee
of Congress which investigated the
fiscal relations between the District
and the United States, today declined
to comment on the measure.
Silent Until House Acts.
"This is the House bill," he said, "and
I do not care to comment upon it. When
it reaches the Senate, then I will have
something to say."
Senator Smith of Maryland, chairman
of the Senate District committee, said
that he preferred not to comment on
the bill until It reaches the Senate.
Senator Smith has been a strong
friend of the District In the past, and
it is to he expected that he will combat
the House measure in its present
form. He is a member, too, of the subcommittee
of the appropriations committee
in charge of the District bill.

Potomac Company Expected to At- [
tack Figures, and May Go
Into Court. 1
Kight million dollars represents the ap- ^
proximate value of the property of the
Potomac Electric Power Company, in the
findings of the valuation bureau of the *
public utilities commission, which today g
submitted its report to the commission j
for rate-making purposes. t
This is the biggest valuation task to f
be concluded by the bureau, and is be- 1
lieved to mark the beginning of long pro- ^
ceedirigs that eventually will terminate a
in the courts before the valuation is es- a
tablished.
* j
Hearings Begin June 26. R
The commission has set June 26 for v
beginning hearings on the tentative t
findings. If the items are taken up p
individually and extensive objections p
made by the company, the hearing may ^
drag into weeks and months. Once s
established by the commission, the n
valuation, it is certain, will be opposed r
in court, ir not acceptaoie to tne com- ^
pany, and the litigation may run into
years. p
Pending the outcome of such probable t
litigation, the commission may attempt
to adjust rates on the basis of the
valuation adopted, but this move, if
made, also will be likely to meet with
legal opposition.
The commission expects to have the
properties'of all local public utilities b
\alued by July 1. The Potomac valua- a
tion, however, it is expected, will fur- *
nish the real test of the power and ef- ?
flciency of the commission as a valu- ~
ating and rate-making body.
Expected to Be Attacked.
It is generally regarded as probable
that the company will attack the bureau's
valuation. The lighting corporation
has been making a valuation of
its own and will be fortified with voluminous
data to oppose any findings of
the bureau with which it does not
agree.
The findlne of the bureau is that the
amount of money expended in the construction
and equipment of the Potomac
Electric Power Company is $7,889,576.81.
The bureau has ascertained, through its
engineering department, that the cost of
r#-nroducfion of th? nhvsl^al ??
- ? - -- r"J ? >"? F?v|/vi ij V/l
the company, as of July 1, 1914, would be
$9,966,088.08, and that the cost of reproduction
less depreciation to be considered
when rates are fixed, is $8,127,342.92.
Hearings Open to All.
At the hearing: not only the company
but all persons or corporations Interested,
it is announced, may adduce before
the commission such evidence as
they may deem proper with reference
to the cost and value of the property,
all of which will be considered in connection
with the work of the commission
for the purpose of the valuation.
The company also will be heard as to
what it considers a fair rate of return
upon its property over and above the
ftat *t cwrtwtivf us mete**. - *
red that the Treasury balance nex
mated.

LONDON, May 19.?There has been
)table fighting on the Verdun front,
here the Germans have thrown fresh
oops into the conflict. Two new divisions
tacked the French lines west of the
euse between the Avocourt wood and
ill 304, and succeeded in obtaining a
oting in a small post near Hill 287, east
the wood. Elsewhere, according to the
ternoon Paris bulletin, the attacks were

rt on the northeast slope of Hill 304
hich the French took the previous day.

United States Foreign Policy
Dictated by Timidity.
DETROIT. Mich., May 19.?Hundreds
of school children waving American
flags were among the throng which
greeted Theodore Roosevelt at the rail- p
way station this forenoon, when he arrived
here to be guest of honor at the
L
American day celebration. Before Col.
Roosevelt was driven to the Detroit
Athletic Club at the head of an automobile
parade, he made a short address
to the Boy Scouts who were lined up
in front of the station. He told them
he believed in their organization because
it taught them to fight for the N
truth and "not to be mollycoddles." a
After luncheon at the Detroit Athlet- tl
ic Club Col. Roosevelt spent nearly
two hours In privacy before he went to
a local opera house to deliver an address
on "Americanism and Prepared- \v
ness for Peace."
This afternoon Col. Roosevelt is to
make a short address to a mass meet- tl
ing in Grand Circus Park, in the heart
of the business district. Before he returns
to New York late this afternoon tl
he is to make an automobile tour of ?<
the city. It was announced that he ,,
expects to spend a few moments visiting
Henry Ford at the latter's automo-.
bile factory. p,
For Unusual Army Training. g,
Col. Roosevelt, in his address at the
opera house, reiterated his opposition
"to all lsinds of hyphenated American- '
ism." advocated universal military
service based on universal training, ,
and declared that we must abolish
"pork-barrel" methods in our national fi
defense, stop talking and get down to
the actual business of thorough pre- "
paredness if we are "to make this nation
as strong as are its convictions in
reference to right and wrong." ^
Col. Roosevelt prefaced his speech
by announcing that he had "come here
to Michigan because in the primary for
the selection of delegates to the re- -ft
publican national convention Mr. Ford
was victorious, and following on his tl
victory here he showed a marked popular
strength in Nebraska and Pennsyl- q
vania. The effect of this showing has p,
beep immediately visible upon many of L
the politicians within and without <j.
Congress." vBlind
to War's Lessons.
"We, through our representatives at
Washington," said Col. Roosevelt,
"have absolutely refused In the small- St
est degree to prepare during these a<
twenty-two months of world cataclysm, of
We have refused to learn the smallest ti<
part of the lesson being written on the th
scroll of torment in Europe. We have bi
fatuously refused to take the smallest to
step, either to do our duty to our- tti
selves or to do our duty to others. We
have endeavored to deceive ourselves
by announcing that in this policy of
supine inaction, and of failure to perform
duty, we are actuated by the ac
loftiest motives. I doubt whether we c
have really deceived ourselves, and
most certainly we have not deceived a
others. There is not a nation in the nc
world which believes that our course ta
of conduct has been dictated by any- D:
thing save timidity, unworthy shrink- aj
ing from effort and responsibility, and ai
cold selfish love of money making and uj
of soft ease. th
"In any serious crisis there are al- pi
ways men who try to carry water on nc
both shoulders. These men try to es- H
cape the hard necessitv of choice be- th
tween two necessarily opposite alter- ha
natives, by trying to work up some
compromise. In actual practice this
compromise usually proves to combine
with exquisite nicety all the defects
and none of the advantages of both h<
courses.

"It Is true that in ordniary political
matters compromise is essential. It
Is true that In ordinary times it is essential.
But there come great crises at
when compromise Is either impossible p !
or fatal. This Is one of those crises. mi
There Is no use in saying that we will
lit ourselves to defend ourselves a littie,
but not much. Such a position Is lti
equivalent to announcing that, if nec- th
essary, we shall hit, but that we shall
only hit soft. The only right principle w<
is to prepare thoroughly or not at all. ne
The only right principle is to avoid 1
hitting if it is possible to do so, but stf
never under any cidcumstances to hit H?/
soft. To go to war a little, but not ** 1
much, is the one absolutely certain
way to insure disaster. To prepare a Pa
little, but not much, stands on a par J*01
with a city developing a Are depart- to'
ment which, after a Are occurs, can *
put it out a litte, but not much." co1
Col. Roosevelt declared thatythe Wil- av
son administration "has taken no step
for preparedness, and has done nothing
eAlcient to sustain our national rights." ?
Because, he said, the administration had
at intervals "ventured feebly to speak ***<
in contradiction of its non-action," the $1(
ultra-paciAsts and their followers have
refused it any whole-hearted support.
They object. Col. Roosevelt added. *
