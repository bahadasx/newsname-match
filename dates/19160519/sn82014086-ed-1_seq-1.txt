ENO WILL CONTESTANTS
CLAIM SENILE DEMENTIA
Relatives Tell Peculiar Treatment
Given Him by His Valet.
..... fc
New Tork, May 18. Amos F. Eno,
a bachelor, who died October 22, 1915,
in his 82d year and left an estate val
ued at $13,000,000, was described in the
proceedings before the surrogate here
today as one who for months prior to
his demise was 'like a tree that had
died at the top."
Counsel for relatives who are con
testing the Eno will, by the terms of
which Columbia University would re
ceive nearly $9,000,000, declared that
witnesses would testify that Mr. Eno's
valet, "used to lead him to bed by the
ear and used to tousle his head and
say to him, 'Come along, old boy, it's
time to go to bed.' "
For twenty years, it was said. Mr.
Eno Jiad been "making wills'" and the
contestants claim that he was a vic
tlme of senile dementia.
"Instead of being a shrewd Yan
kee of a mean anr humble nature," the
attorney for the relatives said, "as an
aristocrat and a spender. He had his
shirts made in Paris, bought his fur
niture abroad and lived a comfortable
and luxurious life. He got up late
and spent about as much time at his
office as you and I would if we were
worth $13,000,000." The upholders of
the will denied that any . undue influ
ence had been exercised upon Mr. Eno,
adding that the contest in reality was
started by the relatives "because, they
had been forgotten."
"They are discontented," asserted
counsel, "because they received only
$4,600,000. They wanted the rest of the
estate., too.'

without approving the five-year bill

ed; twenty - submarines, three to be
eight hundred ton - boats, : compared
with five fleet and 25 coast defense
submarines, recommended; one hospi

ammunition ship. - The gunboat rec
ommended was stricken out an3 ths
fuel ammunition ships were added
from Secretary Daniels' program for
the second year.
,240,000,000 Carried by the Bill.
The total amount can-Jed by the bill
is said to be tC-4O.00o,C0, the largest
naval appropriation nver presented to
congress. While the appropriation
proposed is,, if anything, an increase
over the department's plans, failure
of the five year program and the fact
that no dreadnoughts were provided
for, make the bill unsatisfactory to
administration officials. Secretary
Daniels said tonight he . never lost
hope of getting what he asked for un
til congress adjourned. -
It was clearly indicated that the
senate, which had not yet taken up
consideration of the naval bill even in
committee, was relied tpcn to restore
the battleships. The senate has never
failed to increase the program for the
navy mapped out by the house and
navy officials are confident that the fi
nal bill will provide for at least two
battleshipse and four battle cruisers.
Deadlock Followed Caucus.
The deadlock in the house commit
tee followed a caucus of the eight
representation members of tfco com
mittee at which it was decided to op
pose me nve year program and to seek
to increase tho 1917 apnroDriations
over the figure suggested by the de
partment. Five of the thirteen demo
crats not only opposed the continuing
program, but wero also determined to
cut down the 1917 estimates and not
to vote for any battleshiiD aonronria-
tion. They were willing to support a
four battle cruiser program, however.
and the final compromine was effected
oy Chairman Padgett with Represen
tative Hensley of Missouri, a leader
so-called 'TLittle Navy" democrats,
who induced the other four to Join
him in agreeing to the nve battle
cruisers plan.
Abandoned Five-year Project.
To meet this concession Chairman
Padgett was compelled -to abandon the
nve-year project and It was not
brought to a vote in the committee, as
it was certain of defeat if the repub
licans and little navy democrats com
bined. He was also forced to accept
a provision proposed by Representa
tive Hensley authorizing the president
to call a conference of world powers
at the conclusion of the European war
to . draw plans for an international
peace tribunal. An appropriation of
(200,000 for-this purpose is carried in
the section, which was adopted unani
mously, and H would authorize tne
president to appoint nine citizens dis
tlnaTiiahad njx lawvera and twdom mA.

vote of the-committee,. and against the
