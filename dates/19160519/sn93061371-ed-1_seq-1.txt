proved to be a Jitney In which Annoy'
Gray had started hack to the city.
Seeing Mr. Allison-Dodge in dismay'
and her niece vainly trying to soothe
her, Afhby Gray defied the rain and
dacr.ed from the Jitney to the shed,
offering any assistance possible.
In her agitation to see whether the
slorm prnmi6ed to abate, Mrs. Allison
Dodgo lifted her veil to peer at the
clouds. A sudden twlstlnff wind swept
veil and hat and even the soft white
l;air frurn her head. She cried out and
grabbed wildly at the moving mass of
diilTon and laco and hair, but the wind
was stubborn and the veil became
tangled, and the lady renowned for
her soft white hair and lovely skin
stood revealed with a tiny pigtail of
ivrny hair in which a streak of faded
brown still showed.
Grace stood as astounded as Ashby
Gray, for che had not known that her
aunt wore a wig. Except for one dls-
orfiiit hairdresser there was perhaps
no 6iiy trho suspprtet' that the gradual
writening process through which her'
hair had passed was but the adoption'
of a series of wtg3, each one whiter;
then Its predecessor. After a speech
less Interval which seemed ages to allj
three, Grace managed to help adjust,
the mass of head covering. )
Aunt Clara," began Grace, a mo-;
went afterward, "Mr. Gray says U wiH;
take an hour to run back to town wlthv
tho roads as wet as they are, and
don't you think you'd better let him
take you on In his covered car now'
and let me come on later when the
rain stops?" ,
Something told Mrs. Allison-Dodge'
that this was no time to harbor prej
udice against would-be suitors for her
niece's hand. Besides, and most of'
nil, she wanted to get home and have
in a masseuse and that discreet hair
dresser, and several other people to.
repair hr in time for the evening.'
She was half inclined to assent t
Gray's suggestion that she ride home'
in the closed Jitney. ;
Hurry up, Ashby," called Gray's!
companion from the Jitney,' "I've got.
two assignments waiting for me In
town." ;
Hut the name of Ashby had struct
pleasantly on Mrs. Allison-Dodge's
aristocratic ear.
"Did he call you Ashby? I thought
your name was Gray." She looked In-'
quirlngly ttt Gray as Grace buttoned'
the final button on the rain coat sh
had taken from her own shoulders to"
place upon her aunt. ;
"Ashby Gray," corrected Gray, and;
by way of further explanation, added:'
"Ashby wan my mother's maiden
name."
You don't mean that your mother'
was Amy Ashby who married Dr. Well
ington Gray, the Boston" clergyman?"
"Yes," smiled Gray, as the lady'
manner melted Into effusiveness.
Five minutes later Mrs. Allison-.
Dodge wan speeding alone toward the',
city to be let out at the fashionables
Alhambra from an ordinary jitney. It
suddenly occurred to Grace that Ashby.
might have given up important work
to remain there with her.
"I feel that I've no right to accept
such a uacriflce from you, Mr. Gray,
and If it's important for you to be;
back In town soon, don't let's wait an
other minute on account of the rain. I
shan't mind how wet I get, for 1
haven't any rheumatism, and " she.
met. his smiling eyes with a frankly
amused smile, "I haven't any wig."
"You don't have to tell me that." be'
said laughingly, as he looked adniir-;
lngly at the bronze-colored mass of
hair which tho dampness had dark-,
enod from a bright copper color and;
had kinked each loose lock Into a
tight curl. j
"Poor Aunt Clura; she'd never hint
ed a wig, and what U more, she never
will. I'm glad she made friends with
you before leaving, for now she will
feel that her secret Is in the hands of,
friends only,v and " Grace hesitated
and Ashby added: "And therefore
quite safe."
Grace telephoned her auut as soon
as the arrived at home.
"I'm horse all safe. Aunt Clara; I
thought you'd like to know."
"I'm delighted, dearie; and where IS'
that nice Mr. Gray?"
"He's gone home to dry, but he'a
coming out this eevnlng." j
"nring him over to call on me, won't
you ?"
"If it clears up, maybe; but there,
will be lots of other opportunities,'
Aunt Clara, for he is going to be jour
nephew."
