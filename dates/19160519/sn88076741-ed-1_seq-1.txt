THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
There been no particular "progress"
along the war lines this week. .Around
Verdun there have been no infantry as
saults only cannonading. The only pro
gress has been that of time and un
doubtedly time is a factor for every day
means much expenditure of men, money
and munition?.
There has been considerable peace
talk-ever since Germany said in her re
turn note to the President that she had
offered to talk peace twice but bias been
turned down by the allies. Whether
.Germany is or is not actually looking for
\peace, such an intimation would tend to
put the blame for the continuance of the
war on the allies.
The allies take the stand there can be
no permanent peace until Germany is
conquered. Earl Grey, the wat lord of
England, in a notable talk with a cor
respondent said, the war would be a fail
ure if it did not teach the whole world
the folly of war, and compel a world
wide pact for permanent peace.
In Mexico there is no special change
in conditions. The conference of Gen.
Scott and Gen. Oberegon ended without
any agreement so far as pnblished, but
probably did end in a "gentlemen's
agreement," which neither party cared
to put in black and white because of
possible future complications. Mean
time the U. S. troops are getting some
valuable training.
THREE KINDS OF IRISH.
Caeser wrote "All Gaul is divided into
.three parts." If that celebrated author
-"Was now writing the history of Ireland
for the last three centuries he would be
gin his book with a siiniliar expression.
Perhaps there is no race which are at
MM so much alike individually as the
Irish Celts, and it ta rather a strange
streak of psychology that because they
are so mueh alike they differ so much
ene with the other.
The Irish an witty, generous, whole
•ouled, bright, warn hearted and faith

But they are impetuous and exdte

ranks and often on both sides fighting
against each other. Whether with fist,
shillalay or musket the Irishman is al
ways one of the bravest mid best of
fighters.
The United'States owes much to the
infusion of Irish blood. Thousands of
Irish immigrants from the earlier days
have left a marked impteesion on our
cosmopolitan mixture, while on the other
hand ttie resulting generations of Irish
have themselves been modified largely
by the isfuqion of the blood of other
nationalities. The United States has
never bad a better class of citizens than
these resulting generations thus impreg
nated with.the qualities which stood out
so prominently in the Irish fathers and
mothers.
The Irishman is a natural born extre
mest. Mis national history is most re
markaule lor its own contradictions. He
is the •most patriotic of.
all nationalists
but has the most contradictory ways of
showing it. He is the man who put
both "Pat" and "riot" into patriotism.
His idea of patriotism is.largely a "oat
riot", but is always conscientious about
it.
In Ireland today, and for more than
century .there are threeigeneral divisions
of opinion. These divisions are mostly
founded on- religious -differences, and
have been banded down, from father to
son for several centuries with an accom
paniments the uttermost bitterness.
Broadly speaking, there is a faction
that desire a complete-separation of Ire
land from British rule-and that Ireland
take its place as a separate nation in the
world. We wonder, .however, if this
dream could ever come true what would
happen to the Irish ipeople who are so
bitterly prejudiced against each other.
We fear .that it would be like the "Kil
kenny cats" tied by the'tails and thrown
across a clothes line,
Then in the north of Jreland there is
another lot of exiremests who not only
want Ireland to remain under English
rule, but object to even .a home parlia
ment for Ireland. These are Protestants
and their principal objection to "Home
Rule" is that with a home parliament
Ireland would be ruled by the Catholics
who outnumber the Protestants. These
extremests just before the present Euro
pean war were gathering arms and drill
ing with the object of rebelling against
any law that gave Ireland "Home Rule"
if passed by the British parliament.
Again there is a third faction that
have been fighting for years for Home
Rule and would be satisfied with being
a part of the British Empire but want a
parliament which would govern their
own country much as do other colonial
dependencies of the Empire, which
government has already been agreed to
by the British parliament.
The unfortunate rioting and distur
bances in Dublin two weeks ago, carried
on by the first described faction who
seek to take advantage of the European
war and free Ireland from the "English
yoke."
Thus we have the contradictory spec
tacle in that unhappy country that with
in two years time, one faction was ready
to fight against England because the
latter country was about to grant "Home
Rule" and now the other extremests are
fighting to separate Ireland entirely
from the Empire, while the third faction
is entirely satisfied with things as they
are or will be in a short time.
Ireland may have its grievances
butpt is little wonder that England has
blundered so often trying to govern these
three warring factions of Irishmen.
THE ELOQUENCE OF
MOTHER LOVE.
A True Storv.
It was sixty years ago that the writer
stood as spectator on a steamboat wharf
in Bangor, Maine. It was a busy and
interesting scene full of life and color
(full
able, fall of snergy and fight. There background coaches with pusengers
have been bat few wen bat in which at.end friends, and drayloads ol barrels,
hNt seats Irishmen were found in the bales, boxes and cratss were constantly
of business and sentiment In the

arriving and unloading. The plank plat*
forms of tbe wharf were filled with on
lookers, business people and tbe steam
boat roustabouts rushing the delayed
freight on trucks down the inclined
gangways to be stowed on the lower
decks of the boat At another gangway
tbe passengers were passing in an end
less procession upwsrd to tbe cabin
deoks of the steamer, with many a band
shake, farewell and boa voyage from
their friends on the wharf. As they
went on board they sought places and
seats along the galleries nearest the
wharf to be close to their friends as long
as possible and to «xchange the last
words of farewell. Their combined
weight made the great steamer incline
toward tbe wharf even as if she shared
the feeling of friendliness and leaned
lovingly towards the crowd that she was
so soon to leave feethind.
The captain was on the hurricane
aeck walking badk and forth casting im
patient glances «t tbe hurrying roust'
abouts with the last loads of freight
tbe whistle bad blown for the second
warning, the toell began to toll lor the
last of the passengers to hurry on board
and the friends who were not to go to
hurry to|tbe wharf, while men took their
plaoes at the mooring piles ready to
quickly obey 'the command of the cap
tain to "Cast-off."
Just then down from the street same
to the wharf a hurrying bus but delayed
for obvious
1 reasons until the taatmoment.
From this carriage descended several
police and tbey in turn assisted four or
4ive men 'to-alight, the latter being chain
ed one to tbe other. Tbey were the pro
•duct of the district court held the day
•before.and were on their way to Thomas
ton state prison to serve the terms to
-which they had received righteous sen
tences.
They stood there waiting until the last
loads of freight were trundled down in
to the depths of the steamer -where they
would follow to make their fifty mile
trip, apart from curiosity and thus to
begin their long separation from their
fellowmen. They stood with looks
averted, they had no interest in that
busy throng so full of life. they were go
ing to temporary death with no mourn
ers at their funeral.
The crowd gazed at them with emotions
akin to those we feel when at the circus
or museum we see the wild and disgust
ing hyena snarling behind the bars of
his cage. These were but animals and
dangerous to humanity. There was no
pity for these outcasts, only fear against
the clase and a relief that these at least
were to be placed for a time where they
could not harm society.
But suddenly, from among the silent
by-standera came a cry, along wailing
cry, almost a rythmecal lament, like it
was a song of sorrow. It was
.Rachel
mourning for her first born, even as
David s&ng in his sadness "Absalom, my
son, Absalom." Couched in Irish brogue
mingled with Celtic enderaments that
lament went echoing over the crowded
platforms and up to the crowded galleries
of passengers on the boat. Above the
noises of escaping steam, above the roar
of traffic, came the Irish mother's wild
lament and as she rushed through the
cordon of bluecoats and threw her arms
"bout the neck of her boy with the tears
streaming down her aged cheeks, that
touch of mother-love uiade the whole
world akin.
The spectators forgot that tbe son was
a "plug-ugly" who had been born and
raised on the "Devil's Half-Acre" in
that same city, they forgot that he was
well knowp as a desperate criminal, that
he was only a human hyeua in a cage,
the only thing they heard was that wild
Irish cadenoe, all they saw were those
mother tears.
Amid the rugged rooks of criminality,
among the arid sands of vice, tbrough|a
crust of sordid ignorance had sprung a
clear beautiful spring—and the spring
was all the more beautiful because of
the contrast with its surroundings.
Most of those passengers and friends
and prisoners have long ago passed to
their final destinations, but the memory
of how that mother-love changed the
feelings of that careless crowd, ho*v
those precious motber-tears washed out
the feelings of bitterness from the on
lookers and perchance from the crimi
nals, will always remain with the writer
as long as he lives.
MERIDIAN ROAD ACTIVITIES.
The Pioneer Express is in recipt of a
neatly printed map of tbe Meridian road
in colors, showing the route from Gal
veston to Winnipeg. Every town and
city along the entire route is shown,
which in itself is a big advertisement to
these placee. The maps are issued by
the National Highway Association,
Washington, D. C., and sold at 4 oeats
each and the issue is ualimited. In this
north end two divisions are given, the
one via Hamilton and Greftoa aad the
other via Drayton, intersecting at Pea

fcioaat the north end and Manvel,
eogtibend.
The signs that were placed along: the
entire route when tbe road was first laid
out were elaborate but they did not prove
durable, for most of them are faded so
only the black printing is readable. The
Meridian road officials have taken the
matter up and are recommending a
change, by painting the letters "M" "K"
in large letters on telegrsph and tele
phone poles, or any other place where
such lettering can be done to advantage.
BeeideB these the following stripes are
adopted-for tbe guidance of the travelers:
Straight ahead—A twelve inch white
band.
Turn ahead at road intersection—A
twelve inch red band above a twelve
inch white band. Paint three poles be
fore and three after each such turn.
The lower edge of white band should be
about four feet from the general level of
the ground.
if heretofore painted at a different
elevation d? not change the elevation.
It is expected that you will use telephone
and telegraph poles, fence posts and
trees, or erect posts suitable for the pur
pose. sure to use best white paint
and a dark non-fading red paint. Tbe
red is hard to distinguish at night and,
to briig out the red band, you are re
commended to paint a narrow white
band aliove tbe red band. To secure a
true line it is recommended that you use
a strip of burlap or tin in doing th6
work. A workmanlike job will be a
credit to the community and a.pleasuie
to all passers-by.
Tbe Jefferson highway which starts at
New Orleans and ends at Winnipeg,
taking in the Twin Cities and angles
northwest to Bemidji and Thief River
Falls, intersects with the Meridian road
at Emerson, promises to be a strong
rival to the Meridian road to and from
the south, and there will be a strong
competition between these two trans
continental automobile highways. It is
recommended that the local organiza
tions all along the line see that tbe road
is kept in the best of condition for travel
and that everything is marked accord
ing to recommendation of the national
organization BEzmm
||There is no question but that the
Meridian highway has the advantage
over the Jefferson highway comparing
this state and Minnesota. For four
hundred miles to the south the Meridian
road runs through a level country, with
a soil under ordinary conditions as hard
as Macadamising while the Jefferson
highway runs through very sandy
country most of the way. On the other
band the ''Park Region" of Minnesota
will be a drawing card to many who are
interested in watering places enough to
offset the hardships of traveling on
heavy roads.
Let the local organizations of Pembina
county take this matter into considera
tion and see that the roads are kept in
good shape and proper signs are put up
and we will have tbe travel. The Mer
idian road is established, thousands of
people have already made tbe trip, and
in years to come a farm on the Meridian
road will be worth considerable more
than if the road had neyer been estab
lished. When we say on the Meridian
road we mean for miles on either side of
the National highway.
It may be that in the course of time
the federal government may take charge
of tbeee roads, like they are doing in
Europe in many places and when that
time comes we will be doubly rewarded.
See that the Meridian road is kept up in
your community.
GOOD AND BAD ATHLETICS.
Athletics and particularly school ath
letics are not only valuable for physical
culture but are equally beneficial for
mental and moral improvement. The
boy that enters a race, or throws weights,
playsi foot or basket ball, must use his
brains as well as his muscles. He must
also learn to keep control of his nerves
and temper, and make quick decisions
at exciting periods. He should also
learn to be manly and honorable and
take no mean or unsportsmanlike ad
vantage of an opponent. Honor is the
crux of all amateur athletics. When
the defeated can shake hands with his
competitor then both have succeeded in
the strife, otherwise neither win.
During the meet at Walhalla last
week, as well as for several years previ
ously, the participants and spectators
have Mturnsd full of adverse critioism,
giving details of tricks, unfsirness, pre
juditie and bull-dosing which tended
vety greatly to make tbe objects of the
meet a failure in every respect This
critioism however, is confined to one
school only in the oonnty with the test
of the schools there has always been the
kindest of feelings and good fellowship.
Unless this phass of athletics can be
corrected we think it would be a good
idea to omit tbe yearly oonnty meet in
the
a
future. If such meets are product*
ive et mere bad feeling than good, the
and medals are bat empty
of wone. It la the wrong kind

The Fargo Courier News of last Sun
day devotes one of its leading articles to
A. C. Townley and Townley Brothers,
the head men of the Nonpartisan League
movement. A table taken from the re
cords of three counties on the Missouri
slope shows that these promoters have
outstanding judgements against them
amounting to $376,20604, all of which
the Courier News construes will become
alien on every individual who signs up
and donates his nine dollars and thereby
becomes a partner with these men)
Whether this is law or not the Pioneer
Express is not in position to ssy, but ons
thing is certain that no farmer or any
one else would engage men to run their
personal affairs who shows up snoh stu
pendous blunders in managing tneir own
affairs. And if tbey are not competent
to conduct their own businsss bow can
one expect that they will do differently
in managing a fund amounting to sever,
al hundred thousand dollars oontri uted
at so msny dollars per membership.
The Pioneer Express warned its readers
to beware several months ago and we
reitterate the same caution.
