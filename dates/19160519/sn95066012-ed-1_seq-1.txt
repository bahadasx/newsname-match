SINN FEIN PLOT KNOWN
Government Feared to
Take Drastic
Action.
London, May 19. From testimony
developed yesterday at the hearing
opened by the royal commission to in
quire into the Irish rebellion, it ap
peared that the government had re
ceived advance information of prepara
tions for an uprising with help from
German sources. The testimony was
given by Sir Matthew Nathan, who re
signed as under secretary for Ireland
after the rebellion broke out. The
government had received advices, said
Sir Matthew, that an attempt would bo
made to land arms in Ireland from
German submarines, also that rifles
had been purchased from Irish sol
diers on home leave, while others had
been taken into tiie country in passen
gers' baggage.
The former under secretary gave
this testimony in the course of a
long statement outlining the forma
tion op the national volunteers, of
which he declared a small section only
hail shown themselves disloyal, the
leaders of this section having issued
a manifesto declaring that Ireland
should provide for its own defense
and Indicated an intention to estab
lish a free national government of
Ireland. The leaders of the movement,
he said, directed their efforts to se
curing more rifles and ammunition
and to storing us large an amount
of material as possible. This was
wheie the great danger came from, he
added, as it was felt, that an attempt
ut disarminent might lead to blood
shed.
The executives in Ireland, being in
possession ot sufficient evidence of the
association of the mocinent's lead
ers with a foreign enemy, continued
Sir Matthew, had decided on their
arrest and were discussing the mat
ter on April 21 when the rebellion
broke out. He defended the failure
oi the government to disarm the vol
unteers on the ground that such ac
tion might have alienated the sym
pathies of many loyal volunteers, and
added: ' There are 25,000 Irish Catho
lics enlisted in the army.''

London, directing him to mane every
possible effort to secure a delay in the
execution of sentence of Jeremiah C.
Lynch of New York, a naturalized
American convicted by a court-martial
of being implicated in the Irish upris
ing in Dublin.
Information telegraphed to Washing-
ten last night to Senator O'Gormaii by
friends of Lynch in New York was to
the effect that he had been sentenced
to death and would be shot at mid
night. New York time. Secretary
Lansing, at the direction of the presi
dent, at 9 o'clock last night cabled Em
bassador Page to make representations
in behalf of Lynch in order to save his
life, pending an investigation of t he
facts in this case by the American gov
eminent.
President Wilson was at a theater
when Senator O'Gorman called at the
White House. Secretary Tumulty
hurried to the theater and laid the
facts before the president. Cable dis
patches yesterday had told of Lynch's
conviction but did not give the sen
tence. dispatch from lxindon yesterday
raid: "Jeremiah C. Lynch of New York
has been tried and convicted by a
court-martial In Dublin on a charge
of participating in the Irish rebellion.
The sentence was to he promulgated
today, but no word has been re
ceived by the American embassy here
as to what sentence was imposed.
1'he news that Lynch had been
convicted by court martial was re
ceived by the embassy from the Amer
ican consul hi iHiblin. rreuous to
this the last news the embassy had
of Lynch was that under the defense
of the realm act be was prohibited
from leaving the liremile zone of
Dublin. Tills provision as a rule only
applies to hostile aliens, but can be
extended to tneiuiiy aliens, it was
extended to Lynch, as he had been
making trips to western Ireland.
Lynch has been a resident of Dublin
for soino time."

URGES GERMANS TO OBEY LAWS
Ambassador Bernstorff Issues In
structions to Consuls.
Washington, May IS. Germany,
through Count Yon Bernstorff, has
instructed all German consuls in the
I'nited States to admonish German
citizens in their district to observe
American laws. This was done in
an effort to end various alleged viola
tions of American neutrality. The
ambassador acted on instructions
from the Berlin foreign office. The
announcement today says:
"In consequence of cases which
have occurred of laie, the German am
bassador had sent lnstiuctlons to all
German consuls in the United States
to strongly impress on German citizens
living in their districts that it is their
duly to scrupulously obey the laws of
the state in whic hthey reside.
It was said at the German embassy
that the instructions were designed to
prevent plots and lawlessness on the
part of German citizens who might be
disposed to engage in such. The Ger
man government, it was said, looked
with grave disfavor on any such con
duct and desired that they should en-
age in no such undertakings.
It was not disclosed where special
cases nan been orougui to me atten
tion of the German government, but
it was made clear that the Berlin olli
dais want the I'nited States and its
people to understand that they have
not countenanced any illegal affairs in
which German sympathizers in this
country have been connected.

ODD, "allowing 20 per cent for cars
which probably will be junked."
rho estimate that 20 per cent, of the
S.l'WO.tiiiii cars licensed in 1915 are' go
ing on the scrap heap suggests that
the waste due to the comparatively
thert life of the average automobile
ias in the past been of. staggering pro
portions and continues to be enormous.
But unquestionably the situation is
gradually getting upon a sounder and
more sensible basis through standard
ization and simplification in manufac
ture and a greater degree ot intelli
gence in the purchase of cars.
The question of how long an automo
bile is going to give good service and
how much it is going to cost to main-
am that service are paramount pro
blems affecting the economies of mo
toring. There is where the matter of
implicit)- iu motor car design and con
struction comes in.
The more parts the more wear, the
greater the cost ol maintenance and the
greater the depreciation. Elimination
of unnecessary parts saves tins pur
chaser money when he buvs a car and
means economy every day the car is in
use. The longer the car is used the
greater the saving.

the House committee broke a live-days
