WENTTOAUGUSTA
Instituted Lodge there.
Dr. Emery was the live
wire as usual. Boys re
port grand time.
Last night a new lodge of Oddfellows
were instituted at Augusta Mich., and
at 1 :30 p. ra. about ten auto loads of Odd
bellows from here started across the
countr to the Mecca of the Odd Fel
low festivities.
The new lodge was instituted at three
o'clock in the afternoon and the officers
elected. At six o'clock a bounteous
batquet was served the visitors, which
concluded with a sort of round-the. table
chat. Prof Bolster acted as toastmaster
and short spicy speeches were made by
several of the visitors as their names
were called. The following towns and
cities were represented, Lansing, Grand
Rapids, Reading, Paw Paw, Galesburg,
and Kalamazoo.
The evenidg session was one long to
be remembered. After the preliminary
work nad gone through, the lodge whs
turned over to the Paw Paw lodge No.
18 to confer the degrees, the initatory
first, second, and third. The degrees
were put on in a very creditable manner.
It has been some veais since the Paw
Pa lodtje hos done any work on the
floor, the teams using a stage built in
their hall, and scenery made especially
for the degrees., taking everything in
consideration the four teams did credit
to themselves and to Paw Paw No. 18.
At this meeting there were four Past
Grand iVi asters, viz: Fred A. Rogers, the
present Grand Secretary, H. L. McJNeil
Past Grand Representative, Grand Mas
ter, M. R. Slater and F. II Dailey of
Kalamazoo.
The new lodge started with nearly 50
members, due mostly to ohe efforts of
Dr. William Forbes Emery, a former
pastor of the Methodist Episcopal church
of this city, who was an ardent worker
for Odd Fellowship and the cause of
Christianity in this community.
This wss the Dr's reception to the
boys of No. 18, and he and his assistants
proved themselves royal entertainers.
At an early hour in the morning the
caravan headed homeward, vowing that
the Augusta Boys and Dr. Emery show
ed them the time of their lives, and that
Augusta as a little village, could put on
a few city airs, as far as showing one a
good time.
Lucy," live alone on the farm. The
house was discovered to be on tire dur
ing the noon hour. The sister went to
the rooms above and was suffocated by
smoke. Elmer Brown, a neighbor liv
ing across the road, seeing the house in
fl-tmes went to offer his assistance. On
being told "Aunt Lucy" was upstairs,
rushed to the chamber and rescued the
aged lady.
Mrs. Cornell is the mother of Elmer
Cornell who lives on the Decatur road,
and since the death of her husband a
few months ago has lived on the old
homestead with her sister. The origin
of the tire is a mystery. The house was
insured in Farmers' Mutual Fire Insur
ance Co., and President Pugsley ad
justed the loss last week.

HUMAN BONES ARE
FOUNDJN ATTIC
Mystery surrounds the find
ing of part of human
skeleton in attic of Breeds
ville residence.
Prosecuting Attorney. Earl Burbans
nd the sheriff's office are trying to solve
the mystery which surrounds the find
ing of toe bones of an adult person,
inch were found in a house at Breeds
ville one day last week.
The finding of the bones was a matter
of circumstance, and how they came to
to be there is the mys'ery. Whether
or not some murder had been commited
in that community years ago, or whether
they were used fordemostrating purpose
in echo l work, or some other purpose
is a question. The officers of the county
are trying to find who they belong to,
and how they came to be in the
attic of the bouse. Together with the
finding of ibe bones, Deputy Sheriff
Reersbuttle of Grand J unction, who has
been working with the sheriff's force,
found some human hair about four
inches long which adds more perplexing
problems to the situation,
The house was built Hi years ago by
Mr. Mac Niven, who now conducts a
harness store in Lawrence, and was rent
ed to John Travis, who taught school in
Breedsville. Mac Niven sold the house
to William Lawton, who has occupied it
since Travis moved away.
Mrs. William Lawton sent her twelve
year old boy to the garret to get an iron
ing board, and he discovered the human
bones wrapped in a newspaper (Grand
Rapids Herald) dated 1893. The paper
bearing the name of A. E. Baker. Ac
cording to the older inhabitants of
Breedsville, A. E. Baker lived with his
father, George Baker there some 12 or
15 years ago, but moved away.
Only a portion of a human skeleton
was i n the paper, part of the head and
trunk being missing.
Professor John Travis, a school teach
er now living at 595 West Alexandrine
avenue, Detroit, was seen at his home
Friday night, declared that he had lived
in the MacNiven house in Beeedsville
for a year and a half, previous to coming
to Detroit.
"The bones might have been there
white I occupied the house, as I never
explored the garret very thoroughly,"
he said. "I have been in the garret, tc
Dreak the ice in the water tank up there
and to get screens which were stored
there. MacNiven had some things stored
in the attic while I lived in th house.."
Mr. Travis said that he did not re
member ever having heard of A. B.
Baker and could offer no clue to the
mystery.
Deputy Sheriff Andrew Lang and
Prosecutor Burbans were in Breedsville
the first of the week, trying to clear the
mystery surrounding the finding of the
bones.

The shun ff's force set out at once to lo
cate Harry and he was arrested and
brought r?acH to jail Monday night by
Deputy Sheriff Cone. He admitted
that he took the wheel and sold it to
parlies living in Lawrence 1 he officers

an old otFeruler; that he has been guilty
of a9 grave a crime as horse stealing.
Hit ia out on parole from the state in

Monday Deputy Sheriff Cone located
two wheels that the lad had stolen and
sold in Lawrence, one to Frank Harden
book and one to Mrs. Fred Fisber.
Harry is only It) years old and with
