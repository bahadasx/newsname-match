Two highwaymen last night held up
and rchbed the Postoffice and the Coy
Drug store at lllmo, escaping with
.$12", in cash. George Coy, the pro
prietor of the drugstore, and Henry
Hunger, the clerk, were compelled to
stand against the wall in the rear of
th store while one of the bandits
robbed the cash drawers in the drug
store and postoflice. The postoffice is
located in the drugstore, and by hold
ing jtn the drugstore, the highwaymen
had access to the two establishments.
J. E. Kinkead, the postmaster, clos
ed the postoffice at 7 o'clock, the usual
hour, and was playing pool just around
the coiner from the drugstore when
the holdup took place.
Shortly after 10:"0, while Mr. Coy
and his clerk were preparing to close
the drugstore and go home, the two
men entered. They walked back to
meet the druggists, who stepped to
ward the front of the store, believing
that the men wanted to make a
purchase.
At what appeared to be the ap
pointed time, the highwaymen whipped
out revolvers, pointed them at their
victims and commanded them to throw
up their hands. Mr. Coy and Dunger
complied.
One of the two thugs held the
druggists at bay while the other
rifled the cash drawer of the drug
store, taking something more than
100. He then passed into the post
office, where he forced open the cash
drawer and took $18 in cash. It is not
known whether the thief obtained
other valuables in the nature of
stamps and articles from the drug
store or not.
As soon as the robber completed his
work, he stepped back into the store,
where his companion held the drug
gists prisoners. As he entered the
room he said to his comrade: "Let's
go."
Turning to the druggists he ordered
them to remain quiet, and they did.
The highwaymen passed out of the
building through the rear door and
vanished.
When he believed the danger had
passed, Mr. Coy hurried out of the
store to sound the alarm. He entered
the poolroom where several men were
engaged in a game of billiards and
told them of the robbery. Postmaster
Kinkead was among those present. A
pops,? was formed there and a search
for the bandits was begun.
Xight Marshal Amos was notified
and he took charge of the expedition.
The business section of the city was
searched and then the posse made a
tour of the railroad yards, but no
trace of the two highwaymen was
found.
In discussing the hold-up last night,
Mr. Coy said he was certain there
w ere at least three men in the affair.
The third man, the lookout, remained
on the outside of the drugstore to see
that no one entered the building while
the bandits were at work. Mr. Coy
noticed the man glance into the store
several times while he and his clerk
were held prisoners, and when the
highwaymen completed their work and
made their escape, the man who had
remained near the entrance was seen
to depart in the direction taken by the
men who had performed the robbery.
The description of the pair who
worked in the store was rather incom
plete. The excitement was so intense
that neither the druggist nor his as
sistant thought of anything but safety
for themselves. They were afraid
someone might enter the store and
cause the bandits to assassinate them.
Mr. Coy stated, however, that neith
er of the men in the store appeared
to be more than SO years of age. Both
were roughly clad and each wore a
week's growth beard.
The druggist and Postmaster Kin
kead are of the opinion that the hold
up had been planned in advance. At

Senior Ladies Aid Society to
Commemorate Half Cen
tury's Work.
MRS. F. W. POTT ONLY
CHARTER MEMBER LEFT
Churches in Cape and Scott
County will Join in Golden
Ceremony.
Elaborate arrangements have been
made by the Lutherans of this city
and adjacent towns to commemorate
the fiftieth anniversary of the found
ing of the Senior Ladies' Aid Society
of Trinity church. The celebration
will take place at the church in this
city Sunday, May 28.
Of the nine ladies who composed
the charter members of the society,
which came into existence May 24,
I860, Mrs. F. W. Pott of this city is
the only one still alive. Although 70
years of age, she is just as active in
the organization as she was when she
helped to start it at the close of the
Civil War.
The Senior Ladies' Aid Society
probably holds the distinction of being
the oldest church organization in the
State, and it has played an important
part in making Trinity Lutheran
church of this city such a flourishing
and influential congregation. The
Senior Ladies have never permitted
their society members to lose interest
in their work, and it has hold its meet
ings regularly since its inception half
a century ago.
A program befitting the occasion
has been arranged and the Lutherans
from all parts of Cape Girardeau and
Scott counties will lend their efforts
in making it as -impressive as those
who planned this golden jubilee hope
it will be.
Lutheran churches of Hanover, Cior
donville and Jackson will actively take
part in the exercises, and the Aid So
cieties of these congregations will
work in conjunction with the ladies of
Trinity church. The Scott County
Lutheran churches will also take an
active part in the celebration.
Trinity church will be fittingly dec
orated on that day. Ribbon of white
and gold, emblematic of the occasion,
will be twined about the altar and the
whole interior of the church will be
made aglow with the colors of the day.
The forty members of the Senior
Ladies' Aid Society will wear cos
tumes of white and gold, and will
occupy space in a special section of
the church. The Rev. August Wilder,
pastor of Trinity church, will deliver
a sermon dealing especially with the
church society, its members and the
excellent work they have done.
After the services a reception will
be held in Trinity hall, where the
younger ladies of the church will
serve luncheon to all who attend the
jubilee. Several hundred visitors are
expected to be here for the celebration.
The most distinguished person who
will attend the ceremony will be Mrs.
F. W. Fott, because of her remarkable
connection with the society for which
the jubilee is held. Mrs. Pott has a
host of friends who live over this sec
tion of the State and who are making
arrangements to attend the celebration
just as a compliment to the only char
ter member of the Ladies Aid Society.
Mrs. Pott was born in Germany 70
years ago. When she was 17 years of
age she came to the United States
with her parents, locating in St. Louis.
After a residence of two years in that
city, she moved to Cape Girardeau and
this city has been her home ever since.
Mrs. Pott was born a Lutheran and
she naturally became affiliated with
the church of that denomination when
she moved to the Cape. Although just
a young lady she made herself felt in
the congregation, and was one of the
nine young ladies who formed a church
organization and called it the Ladies'
Aid Society. Since then another socie
ty performing the same functions has
been formed. This has been named
the Junior Ladies Aid Society in order
to distinguish one from the other.
The senior organization served a
splendid purpose, and still does for
that matter; and Mrs. Pott is the most
influential member, because she has
devoted the longest service to the
society. Mrs. W. H. Wilier, wife of
the venerable judge, is president of
the Senior Ladies Aid Society.

the entertainment of the visitors and
the members of the organizations will
be made by the committee in charge.
The picnic will oe well advertised

JAYNES RECOVERS
STOLEN MOTOR BOAT
Find Craft Deserted and Stranded
on Sand Bar 35 Miles
Down River.
After a cruise of 3"i miles down the
river yesterday morning, Roy Jaynes
and his two companions, Fred Meyers
and Louis Hopp, found the Jaynes
gasoline launch, "Loi ine," stranded on
a sandb:.r at Hacker's Tow Head, on
th Illinois side of the river. The
launch had been stolen from the Mor
rison fleet sometime late Tuesday
night.
Mr. Jaynes and his companions
arrived in the Cape about 6:30 o'clock
yesterday evening after having towed
the launch back to this city. They had
set out in pursuit of the boat in the
launch of Bob Brinkopf's and searched
the banks of the river carefully as
they went down.
Mr. Jaynes discovered the loss of
his launch yesterday morning when he
went to work on the Morrison sand
boat. He immediately telegraphed
officers In towns along the river, both
above and below the Cape. The launch
is valued at $1."0.
He organized a searching party and
set out in Brinkopf's launch about 8:."!0
o'clock. They scrutinized both banks
of the river with field glasses and in
places directed their craft close to the
shore to find its place of concealment.
About 11 o'leock they sighted the
boat. The interior of the launch had
scarcely been disturbed. All the ma
chinery was undisturbed and the boat
was resting much as if it had broken
from its moorings and had been
washed ashore at that place. Both
the tow lines were overboard and
dragging in the water.
C. F. Crews, one of the most experi
enced river men in the Cape, declared
that this is a characteristic way in
which river boat thieves operate.
They plan to allow the boat to drift
downstream for a day or two and then
step in as an innocent party to
retrieve it, moor it to the bank in a
concealed place.
If the owner follows it and claims
the boat, the man who has moored it
to the bank claims a substantial re,
ward. If the tfwnfcr defefi n.ot aplffear
the boat is kept.

Well-known Surgeon Is Re
ported Engaged to Miss
Alice Knight.
IS ROMANCE OF CAPE
AND BUT 60 DAYS OLD
Young Woman Is Pretty and
Accomplished He Is Rich
and Prominent.
Dr. G. B. Schulz, the well-known
Cape physician and surgeon, and Miss
Alice Knight of St. Louis, a trained
nur.-c- who recently spent several
weeks in this city at St. Francis hos
pital, are reported to be engaged to be
married, according to a message
received from St. Louis la.t night.
Thf engagement Mas made known
by some of Miss Knight's relatives in
St. Louis yesterday and it was said at
that time that the wedding will take
place sometime in the fall. The exact
date has not been determined.
Dr. Schulz was non-ocmmittal last
night when asked of the engagement,
and refused to affirm or deny the
report.
Miss Knight, who is pretty and at
tractive, is considered the best surgi
cal nurse in this part of the country.
She came to the Cape about two
months ago to nurse Mrs. Max .1.
Koeck at a time when the latter had
an operation performed at St. Francis
hospital.
She was accompanied here by a spe
cialist who performed the onera'fon.
She remained in this city for a month
nursing Mrs. Koeck back to health.
While on duty at St. Francis hos
pital. Miss Knight was introduced to
Dr. Schulz. who fell in love with her.
The couple were seen together a great
deal thereafter and on many mornings
and afternoons, when their duties per
mitted them time for recreation, Dr.
Schulz motored virtually all over the
County with Miss Knight.
They were seen at many private
social functions together and their
friends in the Cape who learned of the
engagement last night, believe they
became engaged to bo married before
Mis'. Knight rturned to St. Louis
about a month ago.
It is said that Dr. Schulz induced
her to remain in the Capo a few days
longer than she at first had planned
after her duties had been performed
in nursing Mrs. Koeck.
She is but 2(5 years old, and when
she was 2:! she was the superinten
dent of nurses in St. John's hospital,
St. Louis, one of the most responsible
women's positions in that profession.
Dr. Schulz is we'I known in a pubiic
way as well as a physician and sur
geon. He is wealthy and on several
occasions has been mentioned for
Mayor of this city. He formerly was
a member of the Board of Kducation,
and likewise has been mentioned for
Councilman in his ward. He never
would accept a nomination for the
position.
He now is president of the Cape
County Medical Association and took
an active part in entertaining the
doctors who visited the Cape at the
time of the Southeast Missouri Medi
cal Association held its convention
here.

Unidentified Man Diet Sit

son in lllmo Yards.
MAN HAD BAG FULL
OF STOLEN PROPERTY
Attacked Officer as He Probed
Sack Knocked Wilson
Down with Fist.
Halleck Wilson, the righting city
marshal at lllmo. last night shot ami
kilic! an unidentified negro. ."0 pounds
nis superior in weight, who had
knocked the marshal down and was
beating his face into a pulp in a battle
over the olTuei's revolver.
The negro sat astride Wilt-on and
slashed at him with a knife in one
hand and rained blows on the officer's
face with the other fist. Wilson at-
j tempted to ward off the blow s of the
j negro giant with his left hand and arm
; as ho tugged for his revolver w ith his
I other hand.
I He finally got his revolver free from
1 his pocket and shot the negro in the
jchtvt and stomach three times, piess
I ing the muzzle of the w eapon against
! the negro's body as he pulled the
, trigger.
I The negro feil over upon Wilson
land died instantly, without having
uttered a word. The weight of the
dead man's body pinned Wilson to the
j ground for a moment. He managed
l to roll the bodv over and craw led out
from beneath.
Wilson Minimoned assistance and
the body wa;- taken to the city hall at
lllmo. where it was held last night.
The authorities also took charge of a
sack filled with articles that had been
stolen from the store of liufus French
a week ago.
The marshal was arresting the negro
on .-uspicion when the fight was
launched. The affair occurred in the
Cott.m licit yards on what is known
as the Ilridge track. It occurred at
:!() o'clock.
Wilson was making the rounds in
the anis when he saw the negro
walking some distance ahead carrying;
a sack over his shoulder. The officer
followed him and finally stopped and
watt bed the man try to hide himself
by squatting down in the weeds.
The marshal walked up to him aid
ordered him to step forth. He asked
the negro what he was doing in the
yard.-, and what he had in the sack.
The negro replied that he was on his
way home with some groceries. The
negro stood on higher ground than
Wil.-on and weighed about 1S" pounds.
Mr. Wilson weighs pounds. He
is feet N inches tall and is .'." years
old.
He ordered the nfgro to carry the
sack further down the yards to a light
in order to permit an inspection of it?
contents.
As he made the order, the negro
dropped the sack and jumped at Wil
son. He struck the officer on the head
as he leaped upon him. The weight
of the negro centered behind the blow
and Wilson went down under the
smash.
The negro followed this up with
blows on Mr. Wilson's face and got
his knife into action. Mr. Wilson de
scribed his tight to a reporter for Th
Tribune as being a fight fo his life
from the time the negro proceeded
to carve away at him.
He said he lay flat on his back as
the negro hammered at him. He
retailed his presence of mind and
directed his energies to getting out
his levolver. The negro f lashed the
thumb of his left hand open with a
long wound running along the thumb,
and another cross-wise, before Mr.
Wilson got his revolver into action.
When he succeeded in pulling the
weapon from his pocket, he pushed the
muzzle against the negro's stomach
and pulled the trigger. Three shots
were fired in quick succession.
"He didn't say a word," Mr. Wilson
related. "He had been sitting on top
cf me and cursing volubly as he struck
me. When I shot him it just seemet?
like he let loose all hold and sank
down on top of me.
"I had to roll him off in order to
get upon ray feet taia. I raa gstftty
badly hammered up oo the My
hand isn't cut badly."
