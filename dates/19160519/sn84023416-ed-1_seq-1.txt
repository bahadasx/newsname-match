had wandered away from home, fol

dam of the American Hoe & Fork

The Clean-Up Committee wishes
the Herald to call the attention of
its readers that Wednesday, May 24,
will be clean-up day for the commu.
nity, weather permitting, if not, the
following day. The committee issues
an invitation to every man, woman
and child to take part. They are in
hopes every one will be one of the
helpers with some instrument of tor
ture for majesty DIRT, be it shovel,
rake or broom; if any one has no
such things in their possession, it
can not be used as an excuse, for the
committee will supply any one with
work of the clean-up nature, if they
will only declare their intentions to
help. Those having refuse about
their premises are asked to deposit
the same at the edge of the street in
a pile convenient for handling and
the committee will see that it is
taken care of. A special favor is
asked of the truckmen and those
having teams which can be used that
day for the carting of refuse that
they be put at the disposal of the
committee. The work will start at
eight o'clock on the flat. If you can't
take part, come out and see the good
work commence, and you will be
surprised when you see two of the
prominent ladies of the community
driving the old gray Dobbin and rid
ing on a dump cart, and some of the
business men will be there; too, in
overalls; it may not agree with their
muscles, but it will do them more
good than a week's vacation or a
fishing trip. The Herald now
wishes to say a word itself. Last
week we asked for co-operation from
the people as a whole, with the
Clean-Up Committee; the week be
fore that we started knocking the
Clean-Up Committee, and came near
getting knocked all over town. Dur
ing these last two weeks we have
been raking our few brains for
words that . would get something
started that would help out the com
mittee, and the only thing that
seeVns to come anywhere near what
we want to say is COOPERATION.
Cooperation with the committee will
be a great help to this movement of
Clean-Up, even if it is for this one
day only. Oh, yes, we will be
there, not with notebook and pencil,
but with dirt's most cruel enemy.
