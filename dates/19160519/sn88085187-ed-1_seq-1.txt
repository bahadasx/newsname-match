Of Masonic hall and which Aldeen
attended," wbb the reply.
"Old you ever go to any of these

"I was told about them," said
"Judge" Randall,
Truant Officer Called.

snd former assistant to Rev. Mr.
Randall, was called.
"Did you ever see anything Im

ior?" be was asked.
"Yes," the young officer re
plied.
"What?"
"She was at those Masonic hall
dances."
"Did no respectable girls dance
at Maaopic hall?"
"Yes.^
"Why, then, did you draw this
conclusion regarding Aldeen?"
"Because she was raggln'."
"Raggln'!" exclaimed Attorney
Hart, who demanded an explana
tion.
Hays She Donced "Close."
"Well, she was dancing close to
the boys." _
Squler said the lights were
turned out while he was In the
dance hall.
He said he knew nothing fur
ther against the girl.

"What else do you know about
Esther Aldeen tending to prove
that she was not good?" con
tinued the attorney.
"Well, she rode around with a
boy on a motorcycle all times of
day and night," Mrs. Winslow
testified.
She was unable to establish the
date nor was she absolutely sure
abotit the time.
She did not see the riders, but
ehe was sure, she said, that it was
