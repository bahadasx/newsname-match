"BOOZE" CONTINUES TO
FLOW IN THIS DIRECTION
Officers Still Leading "Bootleggers" a
Merry Chase and Transferring
Their "Happy Homes"
Several more successful raids were
made last Friday by Deputy Sheriffs
in the Lead Belt, resulting in the tak
ing of a few more whiskey peddles
and the transferring of their "mer
chandise" to the Sheriff's quarters in
this city. Deputy Sam Doss, who
has established considerable of a
reputation at "pussy-footing , and
of. returning with law-breakers he
goes after, headed these raids, and it
required the services of several au
tomobiles to transfer the "wet goods
secured to this city Doss said he was
told by Prosecuting Attorney Davis
to "secure the evidence", so he just
brought it all along."
Gus Sherman's place, at Bonne
m tUo first nlace raided, and
there was secured a barrel and two
half-barrels of whiskey, besides many
bottles of whiskey and wine, whiskey
glasses, etc. After unloading Sher
man and his- goods at the Sheriff s
office, Doss immediately left tor rd
vins, where he "filled an engagement
with a man by the name of Fears and
Ben Butts. At the latter place he in
vestigated the mysteries of the back
room," where he unearthed five gal
lons of "red eye" and closed their
places. intercepted
ui.i Di. -Iiilo makinc a delivery
in v inK - r .
of a wagon load of beer to frank!
Brinsick, from a full car load of that
beverage. The Hun put up the plea
fknf it'woe for bis own urivate con
sumption, but the officers decided to
take him in and permit the Judge to
decide what he thought of the Hun s
capacity as a beer guzzler. If that
fellow had a car-load beer thirst on
liirn when taken in last Friday, it will
probably require a train load of the
foamy beverage to satisiy mm uy uic
time he has another opportunity to
slake his thirst. .
It is high time that the violators
of the local option law awake to the
fact that the people of St. Francois
county are now aroused to the rigid
enforcement 01 tne provisions m
law, and the sooner they comprehend
..h font tho onicker thev will be able
to live in this county without constant

so saturated with the "stuff" that they
cannot stay out of such disreputable
business then they will be forced
either to move eiscwnere, or speiiu
the remainder of their days in jail.
Our peace fficers have decided to take
the matter of law enforcement into
their own hands, without waiting for
, .,,,1,;, i.j and it is now un to the
whiskey sellers to decide what course
they will prefer in the future quit

perpetual jail service.
According to the postal laws, Farm
ington is entitled to free mail deliv
ery in this city whenever the receipts
of the local postoffice reach $10,000
for the sale of postage stamps. Dur
ing the last fiscal year, which ended
on the 30th of June, 1916, the receipts
of this office tell only a nine nori
t v, nmnnnt rennirpd to entitle this
citv to free delivery, and for the three
quarters, attains marcn ,iuiu, ui
present year, the sale of postage
stamps at this office amounted to $7,-
585. , .. .
Thus it will be seen that if the sales
of postage continues for the present
o lm-o-e ns it was during the
4 . . 1L. ........ tUa
past tnree quarters oi me jou,
amount for the year will exceed $10,
000. The records of this office, how
ever, show that the present quarter
ordinarily is the slimmest of the year
:.. V, onlo nf nnatnirn and that UllleSS
a little effort is made in this regard,
the receipts of the office may again
full a little short of the amount re
quired to secure free delivery.
Is it not worth a little effort to se
cure free mail delivery in Farming
ton? It would require but slight in
crease in the sale of postage, which
could easily be taken up by a few
business men, who could make small
remittances in stamps, instead of in
cash, thereby making up any possible
deficit that may be necessary, with
out costing them an extra penny, and
the stamps would probably be as wel
come as tne casn to wow "j
receive them.
r- trac ifolivprv worth this small
effort, think you ? Of what advantage
would it be, you ask? Certainly you
have never given the subject any
thought, if you ask such a question.
Can you estimate how many families
in this city would be daily accommo
dated by having their mail and par
cels delivered daily to their doors?
ASKS TO BE DISSOLVED

Applying for Dissolution
Do you know how many others do
not get their mail more than once or
twice week, simply because of the
inconvenience to them of coming to
the postoffice, or getting others to in-

If you would permit your thoughts
to play along sucn nnes a iiue, men
it is likely that no such questions

the advantage that free delivery would
be to Farmington. Another thing
that just now occurs to the writer is
that it would furnish two or more
very desirable positions as carriers,
with fair remuneration, and would
mean a good living to at least two
fnmiiio.!. .1,1,1 thprp would nrobably
be another man to handle the parcel

to it i..,it x:t 000 annroximatelv.
All of this can easily be secured
,,;n,,.ni tlw. niitlav nf one cent 01 ex-
n, ,m,l all that will be required
will be just a little co-operation on
the part of a few citizens, to see that
this year s postottlce Business is sui
ficiently huge to entitle this city to
the establishment of free postal de
livery, which, as above indicated, can
be accomplished simply by the pay
ment of a few of their smaller bills
with postage stamps. Free delivery
would not only be a splendid adver
tisement for this city, but it would be
of even more direct and tangible ben
efit in increasing the revenues com
ing into this city by several thou
sand dollars each year. But someone
must have a directing hand in this
matter, to see that this golden oppor
tunity is not overiooKeu. men me
only other thing that will be neces
sary to have free delivery instituted
is the numbering of the houses. Don't
put yourself in the "observation" list
by asking "is it worth while?" Wake
up, and you will know it is worth
while. Then grab it!

Oiling the Streets Several New Ones
The work of giving the streets of
Farmington another coat of oil has
been in progress all this week, and
that splendid improvement is now
nearly completed. All of the princi
pal streets of the city will have been,
or will be, gone over by the new oil
sprinkler, which is doing most excel
lent work. One of the inestimable
benefits that will result from this work
is that this city will be practically
free from dust the ensuing summer,
so that the work of keeping houses
and stores clean will be reduced to a
minimum.
Mayor McKinney informed a Times
reporter that two large tanks had
been received, for this work, which
he estimated would be practically
enough to properly perform the
sprinkling desired. The cost of this
oil was something over $1,100, and
he thinks it would be impossible to
make a better investment that would
result in so much good to Farming
ton. The people generally feel this
way about it, as was indicated in the
subscriptions to tnis tuna, many cit
izens did not wait to be seen by the
solicitors, but voluntarily came in and
paid over their money, stating that
they were glad to assist in such work.
It requires four horses to haul the
sprinkler, and the work will probably
be finished this week. A strong flow
of oil was turned on, which is esti
mated to be sufficient to keep the
streets in splendid condition for the
next twelve months. It puts the
streets in ideal condition for travel,
especially for autoing. and there is no
dust trail left to suffocate the resi
dents "by the side of the road."
tu.. ii,.i- thp nnat week has con
tinued somewhat unfavorable, for
growing crops as well as ior increas
ing newspaper subscription lists. A
little more warmth is necessary to
t qc wpll as neonle. in nor
mal condition. However, the follow
ing new and renewal subscriptions
have been received at The Times of

MILD FORM OF SMALLPOX
For the past week or so there have
cases of smallnox
in Formincrton. so mild indeed that the
parties were not sick and were not
aware that small eruptions were oi
the smallpox nature. There are only
three cases now, anu tney are quar
antined; but the parties are not even
confined to their rooms, but knocking
around in the open air in the yards of
their homes. The Mayor and the
City Boird of Health are looking care
fully after the cases and every" pre-
caution is being taken to prevent its
spread no danger of which is anticipated.
