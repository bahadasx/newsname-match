Eight Bootleggers Sentenced
Thursday morning was penalty
day in the superior court. At
that time Judge Sapp pronoun
ced sentence upon seven men
who had previously been convict
ed in his court of violating the
prohibition law.
Six of the seven men were
sentenced to pay a fine of $100
and serve a sentence of 1 year in
the county jail. The names of
rhfsp men are E. Baca. Tom
Reed, Bob Johnson, Len Wilson,
Harry Kinman and rienry ivruii
hoff. The seventh man. Tom
Meyers, was fined $300 and given
a sentence of 18 months in jail.
On Tuesday Judge bapp sen
tenced a Japanese named bcni-
mizu. who pleaded guilty to sell
ing liquor in his restaurant in
Winslow, to pay a nne or $iuu
and serve six months in jail.
Upon recommendation of county
attorney the jail sentence was
suspended after the fine was
Paid. .. J
Meyers, the man wno urew
the heaviest penalty, had been
in court before on a similar
charge. He elected to stand
trial before a iury and secured
Attorneys E. P. Con well and J.
E. Jones to defend him. His
trial occurred Tuesday, the state
being represented by County At
torney Jordan. He was found
guiltv bv the jury a few minutes
after the case went to tha body.
The heavy penalties imposed
by the court upon these eignt
offenders, and the evident de
termination of the county at
torney and the sheriff's office to
put a stop to the illicit sate oi
intoxicants, will no douDt nave
a salutary effect upon others en
gaged in the traffic.
