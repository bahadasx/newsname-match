ing the cleanest rifle. Will Hart won r

Asheville, N. C., May 17.?Reelection
of the Rev. Dr. Lansing Burrows v
of Americus, Ga., as president for an- d
other term and the presentation of
the foreign mission board's report, c
recommending that the Southern Bap- "
tist convention decline to enter into a
urlion with other denominations in e
foreign mission work featured the I
opening session of the Southern Baptist
convention here today. This and v
other reports presented today will be I
discussed later.
Dr. Burrows was elected over M. c
H. Wolfe, a lay member from Dallas, 1
by a vote of 7.10 to 655. Other officers
chosen were: *
Vice president, B. C. Henning, ^
Elizabeth City, N. C.; J. D. Mell, of c
Athens, Ga., and J. C. Stalcup of
Oklahoma City; secretaries, O. F. \
Gregory, Baltimore and H. C. Moore, ^
Raleigh, both reelected; treasurer, $
George W. Norton, Louisville; auditor,
W. P. Harvey, Harrodsburg, Ky. \
Possibility that the Southern con- f
vention will hold a meeting at the
same time and place with the Northern
Baptist convention next year was
brought out by efforts by members of
the Southern Baptist churches in Kan- 1
sas City to make that place the next c
convention city. It was said efforts 1
were being made to get the Northern J
Baptists now in session at Minneapo- c
lis, Minn., to meet next year in the i
Missouri city. New Orleans, Hot i
Springs and several other Southern
cities also are seeking to entertain
the Southern Baptists in 1917.
The report of the Sunday school
board, presented today, shows total '
receipts of $452,729, with a balance *
on hand of more than $30,000. The 1
foreign mission board announced com- f
pletion of the Judson centennial fund '
of $1,250,000 for aiding foreign mis- 1
