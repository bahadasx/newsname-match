Oregon and California Und
Grant Title Is Not Clear
Washintgon. D. C As the Oregon
A California land grant bill stands on
the bouse calendar, it will not enable
the government of the United States
to pass a clear title to any settler or
purchaser, In the opinion of Repre
sentative Hawley. and be has the sup
porting opinion f several of tha good
lawyers of the public lands committee
In this opinion. , . .
"Toe MIL" said Mr. Hawley,
"makes provision for the payment of
back taxes that is. for Usee that
have accrued for the past three years,
but I believe It does not provide for
tha payment of taxes which aire now
becoming collectable. Moreover, the
bill fails to make provision for the
payment of interest on back taxes and
fails also to provide for the payment
of penalties on those secrued taxes.
These omissions, in my opinion, render
It ironossible for the United States to
give an absolutely clear title and I will
call attention to this shortcoming when
the bill ia before the bouse.
"The prime reason for providing in
' . . -. . .
the bill for the payment of back taxes
wss to enable the government to give
clear title. Unless that section is
enlarged and made complete ' it will
fail of its purpose sod those who ac
quire these lands from the government
will be liable for interest and lor toe
unpaid penalties and for the taxes that
are not paid by the government under
the Ferris bill."
Smudging Need Shown in
Southern Oregon Fruit District
Medford In the opinion of local
fruit men the year 1916 will mark the
final demonstration of the necessity of
crude oil smudging in the growing of
fine fruit and spples in Southern Ore-
con.
At the beginning or the season were
wss a distinct movement against
smudging, chiefly because of tha an
noyance involved and damage to trees
from overflowing pots. In fact an In
junction against smudging was ob
tained by one group of orchards shortly
before the May freeze.
All this anti-smudge agitation is
ended now in the opinion of local grow
ers, for from May 8 to May 14 emudg
Ingin Rogue River valley orchards
wsa worth at least $500,000.
Those orchardists who smudged, and
fortunately a large proportion of them
did, lost practically nothing from the
low temperature, while except on the
high hillsides those who did not
smudge were wiped out While the
loss haa been serious. It Is certain ac
cording to experts who examined the
orchards that the first reports were
greatly exaggerated.
