GREATEST NUMBER OF RUNS DRIVEN IN

Batters Who Make Their Hit Count
"Gavvy" Cravath of the champion Phillies holds the 1916 record for the
greatest number of runs driven In In one game. He hit home eight In the
contest with Cincinnati on August 8, twice sending three men over the plate
by doubling. The last major leaguer to turn this trick was Harry Davis, who
did it in 1890 against Brooklyn. Harry then was with the Giants. Fournler
of the White Sox set the American league record for the year when, on July
8, he batted in six tallies.
BEST BALL PLAYER OF YEAR
George Slsler of St. Louis Browns Can
Play Any Position on Diamond
Is Hard Hitter.
"How long do you think it will he
before baseball produces another
player like Ty Cobb?" someone asked
of a crowd of old-timers in the press
box during a recent fanning bee.
"Looks to me as if it had already
produced one," remarked George
Davis, scout and former manager of
the Giants. He was looking at Slsler,
the versatile young athlete of the
Browns. "There's about the best ball
player we've seen In years."
This brought on quite a discussion,
and sfter going all the way down the
Tine of new stars it was the unani
mous verdict that Slsler is by far the
greatest ballplayer discovered in recent
years. And this is not due entirely to
W versatility. Though he can play
any position on the diamond except
behind the bat he is a star in any
Place they put him.
Slsler is a great pitcher, a dandy

Players of the Yankees believe that

Outfielder Shorten of the Red Sox
is said to be one at the best young
players ever signed by the Hnb cham

Connie Mack has forbidden golfing be
cause he believed it spoiled the batting
eye of some of his Athletics last sea
son. Clark Griffith has unearthed a prom

who played with Minneapolis last year.
Gharrity may fill the shoes of Catcher
Alnsmlth of the Washlngtons, as the
latter is troubled with his eyes.
"Ollie" O'Mara of the Brooklyn Na

It will take some tall hustling on the
part of any recruit to oust the peppery

"Jimmy" Callahan reports the Pi

Wagner will be his able lieutenant,
and from all accounts the athletes wiil

STOP PASSING BATTER
RULE SUGGESTED TO MAKE
BASEBALL MORE INTERESTING.
Free Pass Evil Is "Booed" by Every
Fan Who Really Loves Game
Batter Always Anxious to
Boost Batting Average.
Whenever a batter receives a base
on balls, or Is hit by a pitched ball,
the manager of the team at bat may
have the alternative of permitting the
batter to take first base, as has been
customary under the present rules, or
he may put a base runner on ft rat base
and permit the batter to continue at
bat. The base runner substituted shall
be permitted to re enter the game at
any other time as a base runner, and
the batter shall not be forced out of
the game as Is the custom under the
present rules when a man rues for
him.
The rule above will accomplish
many things, make the game more
speedy, make for more control on he
part of the pitchers, make more and
better base running, make it necessary
to keep at least one lightninglike run
ner on tho squad and do away with
Intentional passes.
Perhaps where It will make the big
gest hit with the players 1b that It
will make for bigger batting averages.
When a hatter is hit by a pitched
ball or passed by being given four
balls, he is not credited with a time at
bat, it is true, but, on the other hand,
it is a time he does not have a chance
to make a hit, and every batter wants
as many chances to boost his batting
averages as possible.
The free pass evil is "booed" at by
every fan who really loves the game.
To not permit a brilliant hltsmlth like
Cobb to get a fair chance at making
a hit, when a hit means runs and per
haps the game, is something the fan
frowns upon.
He wants to see his hero stride up
to the plate, pick out one to his liking
and smash it out for a three-bagger
or a homer and send In runs ahead of
him.
BODIE DISLIKES BIG LEAGUE

The humorous sport paragraphers
never did appeal to Ping Bodle's sense
of humor.
They grated on Ping's nerves so
long that they finally succeeded in
driving him from the big leagues.
Ping is on the coast now and doing

Ping wouldn't return to the big show
even it he got the opportunity.
Out on the coast the demon fence
buster and macaroni consumer Is
quoted as saying: "No more big
league stuff for mine. They kidded
me out of the majors and I'm through
with them. I'm content to play in the
minors, because here the fans are
kindly in their treatment toward me.
So are the players. The sticks ar
good enough for me."

In the Village, Northwest of Verdun.
'-Yesterday I witnessed a great battle,
the climax of the Verdun struggle,

Imagine yourself in the dark cabin
of a ship, the whole fabric of which
shudders in the tumult of her mighty
engines as you peer through a narrow
slit at a quick-changing cinema on a
distant screen. For that was the
Verdun battle as I saw It, save that
those rapid glimpses revealed horrors
no producer would dare feature.
Captain A. had led me through a
maze of trenches to an observation
post buried deep In a hillside due
south of Cumieres village.
Two officers and some soldiers are
at work regulating the fire of a bat
tery two miles in the rear upon the
German trenches down to our right,
near the river, where the enemy is
massing for an assault. At the same
time they directed a searchlight whose
rays Illuminates their field of vision.
"Follow the searchlight and you will
soon pick out the German trenches
and see the effects of our fire," says
my guide. It is a patch of field,
streaked diagonally by a dark line,
which is the German trench. Clouds
of smoke obscure it at Intervals,
stabbed by swift flashes.
I watch Interminably. Nothing
changes. Then the observer throws
another order Into the telephone and

Suddenly the field patch is covered
with scurrying dots, like a mass ot
excited ants, rushing forward across
the light, out of the picture into
the darkness. It is the enemy charg
ing at last.
Then a dense thunder-clou covers
everything. The searchlight's rays
beat vainly against its yellowish
walls. The class trembles to mv
hand.
Like a nightmare vision, conjured
by magic amid the smoke, herrihle
scene is revealed; first dimly, then
clearer and finally very distinct. In
the sharp white light.
The field, the dark line and tho rush

place a ragged hollow, wherein blocks
of earth like huge tree trunks roll and

Among them the tray dark things
are writhing like fallen leaves flut

objects are German soldiers.
As the smoke cleared I distinguished

British Submarine in 24 Days
Sank 23 Ships and De

Dardanelles Receives Great
Reception.
New York. The story of how the
British submarine E-7 entered the Sea
of Marmora and operating tor 24 days
sank 23 ships, shelled two railway
trains, and did other damage, Is told
in a letter received in New York. The
letter was written by a young officer
who was on the E-7. The Cochrane
who is referred to as "absolutely
splendid" is the commander of the E-7.
He says: ,
"We returned safely after 24 days up
the Dardanelles in the Sea ot Mar
mora. It is hopeless to try to give a
detailed account In a letter, but you
can take it from me it was a fine show.
We broke all previous records. Coch
rane was absolutely splendid. The
tale of our doings Is the sort of thing
one reads ot in the old days. We went
around the Sea of Marmora, leaving a
trail ot sunk and burning ships. We
fairly shook things to the core.
"We are the first submarine In his
tory to bombard a place on shore un
der Are. I think we were under Ore
about three times a day on an average,
and penetrated Into all sorts ot places
and destroyed shipping. We even
shelled a railway and destroyed two
troop trains. We shelled the embank
ment and blocked the line and then
caught the trains as they came along.
It was the funniest thing you can Imag
ine to see the trains try to hide behind
trees, but we caught them and smashed
them all to blazes. The ammunition
all blew up with a terrible explosion.

17 large sailing ships, and hit two
trains, one railway embankment, and
a few villagers who fired on as and

with a small gunboat one day on the
surface and drove her off, although she
fired 200 rounds from her two guns.
After that we were left alone and
everything ran like blazes when we
