PETITIONS TO CIRCULATE
In a letter to a prominent official
of the state, a merchant in a loggias
community in the southwestern part
of the state severely arraigns the
methods or lack of methods in pro
viding aid for injured workmen and
offers to assist in bringing about a
better condition through the medium
of initiative measure No. 20. Owing
to obvious reasons the name of the
merchant and his location arc not
available for publication, but his let
ter, being from an entirely unpreju
diced source, is given herewith in
refutation of the misstatements being
sent broadcast by the Employers' As
sociation :
In Line With Human Decency
"Initiative measure No. 20, placln?

occupations in the hands of the In
dustrial Insurance Commission for
medical treatment is before me for

with my ideas of human decency. I

have here about three to four hundred
workingmen in the logging ramps.
During these years some awful acci
dents have happened. When times are
good, and the men are crowded to the
limit for results, trouble increases.
We have never been able to keep a
resident physician for the reason that
the men would use him and thereby
cut into the $1 taken from the men
deeper than was thought good for the
owners. One lumber company, now
out of business, averaged $225 per
month taken from the men. It was
so fat a fund that they sold it out to
a Portland doctor, who in turn sold it
to Astoria doctors, and the men, no
matter what their injury, bad no first

EXPOSE "OPEN
SHOP" PRETENSE
Worcester. Mass.- In a public state
ment building trade unionists answer
the claim of contractors that if they
concede the union shop "it would
mean that we would lose control of
our business."
The unionists reply:
"What control have they to lose to
organized labor, or anybody or any
thing else, when they admit in con
ference that Metal Trades concerns i
employing them in construction work
will not permit them to employ or
ganized craftsmen?"
In answer to the employers' claim i
that they do not favor the sympa- <
tlietlc strike, the workers say:
"Of course not. but they can, and
do, stand for sympathetic action by
all employers in the crusade being
waged against organized labor under
the malevolent leadership of the
Metal Trades association."
CANADIAN MOLDERS GAIN
Hamilton. Ontario - As a result of
conferences the Iron Molders' union
has raised wages to $3.50 for a nine
hour day. The old schedule was $3.25
for a ten-hour day.
Kingston. Ontario.--Every molding
shop in this city has accepted the new
wage scale of Iron Molders' union.
Itates are increased 25 cents a day,
making the minimum $3.50.
WHY WORKERS DEMAND
MORE
Philadelphia. An answer to the
question. "Why do workers strike?"
is found in the list of income tax
paid by corporations in this district.
The corporations include all lines of
activity. These concerns have paid
$2,907,283. The tax is 1 per cent of
the net earnings, so this years' as
sessment Indicates total earnings of
corporations in this district to have
been $290,728,300, a gain of $04,613,400
over the year before.

men and not give them full value for
it. That will never be as long as it
is left to the hands of ignorant fore
men and greedy owners to handle. I
have been watching it here for the
past several months, for I was in a
position to see it in its true workings.
Local Doctor Suffers
One doctor located here, counting on
this camp business as a part of his
practice. He is a splendid physician
and just the man for this place, yet
the camps quarrel with him over the
smallest bills and do all they can to
drive him out. This Is caused for the
simple reason that the men get more
treatment for minor injuries, or the
foreman will dispute over reasonable
bills, for they want to save money
aid, but were taken over to , if
the local doctor. This is a crime for
this $1 is a trust and not a graft taken
because they could do it. I could
name fully ten men who have lost
their lives here for want of first aid,
and it will go on so long as we have
no local doctor.
"Is the Industrial Insurance Com
mission back of this bill? I believe
ithe lumber men are fighting it hard,
as I get letters asking for copy of
j names of men who may have signed
the petition. They offer liberal pay
for the service, which would indicate
jit was a measure that was aimed at a
sore spot, and lite lumber men were
fighting back. As I said above, this
is not a matter to leave in the hands
of some camp bully, who drives with
out mercy or often without sense of
his men. The railroad companies,
where I have observed, send in a doc
tor with their grading crews, where
much new work is underway. The
camps pay in enough
money each month, if expended by
your department, to have the best sort
of medical aid at hand. There is a
large farming community here, with
both fields to support a doctor we
could have a splendid service. I will
fully co-operate with you in any way
that you may wish to further the good
work you have on hand. If the peti
tion should he attended to here, mail
it to me and I will have it done."
AN APPEAL TO
STRIKE BREAKERS
Chicago.—Strikers at the MeCor

strike breakers last week:
"We know we are entitled to more

,by the company are not enough for a
decent living, and we—both men and
women reject Hum and stand for
our just demands

There is soon to come from the Gov

women who have lived the stories it
contains, one of the most remarkable
documents ever published by the con
gress of the United States.
The book will bear the official im

already been called by Congressman
John I. Nolan of California, author of
the bill providing that hereafter this
government shall not pay any em

It is probable that no government
will ever print a more severe indict

Hearings on the Nolan bill have
been conducted by a subcommittee of
the House Committee on Labor. These
hearings may well be read by every
government official, by every person

CIRCULATORS WANTED FOR
INITIATIVE PETITIONS
CALL AT LABOR TEMPLE
During the next sixty days every
citizen of Everett must be given an
opportunity to sign initiative petitions.
The initiative law forbids the pay
ment or promise of payment to any
persons circulating initiative or refer
endum petitions. So w emust call
upon men and women to give their
services to this work without thought
of money compensation for the time
spent. It means that we must call
on men and women who have this
work at heart to give of their time
after working hours or during leisure
moments. It entails some sacrifice on
| your part, but the end is worth it. If
j you will call at the Labor Temple you
can obtain petitions to circulate in
your locality. Let us prove to the
reactionary forces who are trying
legislation that the people are jealous
of that right, and will never see it
abrogated. The best way to do that
is to pile up signatures on these ini
tiative bills. Will you help? Go to

The Nigger In The Woodpile
Many citizens of Kverett have been
filled with curiosity the past week in
view of the attitude of the so-called
newspapers of the city in regard to a
happening which, under ordinary cir
cumstances, would be considered a
matter of great "news value."
Slurs and imputations have been
hurled at the local daily press for
suppressing news that our citizens
find printed in newspapers of other
cities.
However, a slight analysis of the
situation will show that the position
of the Kverett dailies is taken from
necessity and not from choice. The
"nigger in the woodpile" is a very
evident gentleman, if we pause long
! enough to look for him.
The finding of the gentleman of
color in the Kverett woodpile gives
food for some concentrated thinking
on the part of those citizens who are
producing the prosperity of Kverett.
Why can news be suppressed? Why
do the daily papers fear to print facts
in regard to happenings in Everett
that are blazoned forth under scir
j heads in Seattle papers? Why are
the daily papers of Everett muzzled?
Would they be muscled were the cir
cumstances of the pn sent news dif
ferent, were the principles of a dif
ferent so-called class? Has all of this
any bearing on the plea to Kverett
working men and women to "buy at
home"?
