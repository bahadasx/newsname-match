IN OUTLINE OF
NAVAL MEASURE
Committee Completes Ap
propriation, Leaving Out
Five-Year Program.
$240,000,000 IS TO BE
THE TOTAL AMOUNT
Authorizes Construction of
Five Cruisers, Ten De
strovers and 20 Subs.
WASHINGTON, May 18. Admin
istration forces In congress lost
the first skirmish in the naval pre
pa redness campaign toduy when the
house committc broke a five-dny
deadlock and completed the naval ap
propriation bill without approving the
five-year building program advocated
by President Wilson Und Secretary
Daniels.
As finally an reed to the bill au
thorities the construction In 1917 of
five battle cruisers as against rwo
drcadmiurhts and two battle cruisers
recommended by Secretary Daniels,
four scout cruisers, an increase of one
scout over the department's program;
ten destroyers as against IS recom
mended; twenty submarines, three to
be eight hundred ton boats, compared
with five fleet and 25 coast defense
submerslbles recommended: one hos
pital ship, one oil fuel ship and one
ammunition ship. The gunboat rec
ommended wag stricken out and the
fuel and ammunition ships were ad
ded from Secretary Daniels' program
for the second year. -
. , Itlgccst In History.
The total amount carried bv the
bill is 1240,000.000. the largest naval
appropriation ever presented to con
gress. While the appropriation proposed
Is. If anything, an increase over the
department's plans, frilure of the
five-year program and the fact that
no drfadnaiights were provided for
make the bill unsatisfactory to ad
ministration officials. Secretary Dan
iels sild tonight ho never lost hope
of getting what he usked for until
congress nrtjourned. H was clearly
Indicated that the Berate, which has
not yet tbken up confederation of the
naval bill even in committee, Is relied
upon to restore the buttleshlps. The
senate has never falld to Incrase the
program for the navy mapped out by
the house and naval officials are con
fident that the final bill will provide
for at least two battle ships and four
battle cruisers.
IX-adlock After ('uncus.
The deadlock in the house com
mittee followed a caucus of the eight
republican members of the commit
tee at which it was decided to oppose
the five-year program and to seek to
Increase the 1917 appropriations over
the figure suggested ' y the depart
ment. Five of the 13 Democrats not
only opposed the continuing program
but also were determined to cut down
the 1917 estimates and not to vote
for any battleship appropriation. They
were willing to support a four-battle
cruiser program, however, and the
final compromise was affected by
Chairman I'adgett with Representa
tive Ifensley of Missouri, a leader of
so-called "Little Navy" Democrats,
who Induced the other four to .loin
him in agreeing to the five-battle
cruiser plan.
Abandon Project.
To meet this concession, Chairman
Padgett was compelled to abandon
the five-year project and it wag not
brought to a vote in the committee as
It was certain of defeat if the Repub
licans and little navy Democrats com
bined. He was also forced to accept a pro
vision proposed by Representative
Hensley authorizing the president to
call a conference of world powers at
the close of the European war to
draw plans for an international peace
tribunal. An appropriation of 8200.
000 for this purpose Is carried in this
section which was adopted unani
mously and It would authorize the
president to appoint nine citizens dis
tinguished as lawyers and peace ad
vocates to represent the I'nlted States.
The compromise building program
was carried by the solid Democratic
vote of the committee and against the
iiolid Republican membership.

ways and means committee and
Chairman Simmons of the senate fi
nance committee revised estimates of
the government's receipts and expen
ditures for the remainder of the cur

ending June 30, 1917, tending to show
that much less new revenue will huve
to be raised to meet the bill for pre
paredness and other large contem
plated expenditures than had been
supposed.
Only ubout $150,000,000 in addi
tional revenue will huve to be pro

McAdoo said. This Is less by 875,000,-
000 than the most ccnservatlvo mem

All of the additional revenue will
come from taxes on Incomes, inheri

OKLAHOMA CITY. May 18. That
the Progressives will Insist upon the
nomination of Theodore Roosevelt ut
th3 coming Republican national con

of John Hale, chairman .of the Pro

Hale does not ugro with George W.
Perkins, who recently said thut tha
Progressives would not insist on
Roosevelt.
On the other hand, Mr. Hule says
he believes that the Progressive rep
resentation will insist that Roosevelt
be the nominee, and ho furthermore
believes that the Republicans will be
In accord with the demand, and that
Roosevelt's nomination is certain.
While tho Progressives and Repub
licans are to hold conventions In the
same city at the same time, It is the
opinion of Mr. Hale that an agree
ment of tome kind will be reached
before the two conventions are called
to order, and thut the Progressives
