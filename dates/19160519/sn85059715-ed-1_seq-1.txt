Attorney General A. A. Lilly is lulled to make a
public address at the court house at Clarksburg this
evening in support of his own candidacy for the nom
ination for governor of West Virginia. This occasion
will afford an opportunity for Mr. Lilly to set himself
right with a large class of citizens of the state of West
Virginia, and in order to facilitate any endeavor in
that direction 011 his part, tlie Telegram desires to pro
pound a simple question for him to answer.
It is openly charged in the press of the state, and
by Republicans in public addresses, that General Lilly
is in favor of prohibition and the enforcement of the
prohibition laws when speaking in "dry" territory, or
in territory where that sentiment largely prevails, and
that he is a " wet" candidate, or opposed to prohibition
or the enforcement of prohibition legislation when
speaking in communities where a large part of the peo
ple are in favor of more liberal legislation on the liquor
question. The Telegram does not attempt to speak for
M.r Lilly, and does not charge him with entertaining
these contradictory views and advocating these contra
dictory doctrines for political purposes, but it refers
simply to the fact that Mr. Lilly has been repeatedly
charged in reputable newspapers and by reputable cit
izens with these inconsistencies. If these accusations
are. false, General Lilly can easily answer them and set
himself right before the people of the state.
Will He Answer These Questions?
1. Will you, if elected governor, enforce the lawjr
on the statute books of West Virginia, prohibiting the
liquor traffic and the misuse of intoxicating liquors iu
W est Virginal
2. Will you, if elected governor, make any effoi*t
to cause to be ropealed any of the laws now on the
statute books prohibiting the sale of liquors in the state
of West Virginia, or the shipment of the same into the
statei
These questions arc simple and the people of West
Virginia request a simple answer, yes or no. There is
no cxcusc or reason for you to befog the matter by
wordy explanations or attempted explanations -which
do not explain. Let the people have your plain simple
answer to each of these questions, 3'cs or no.
If you do not answer these questions tonight in
your address at the court house, the people will take it
that you desire them to understand that you are for
prohibition in sections of the state where that senti
ment prevails, and that you are against it in sections
of the state where the wet sentiment prevails; that you
have no "convictions on the subject and are ready to take
either side of it at. any time, or both sides of the ques
tion, whenever to do so will advance your personal in
terests.

DETROIT. Mich., May 19?Colo
nel Theodore Roosevelt, In an ad
(dress here today, reiterated his op
position "to all kinds of hyphenated
; Americanism," advocated universal
miltary service based on unlvorsal
training, and declared that we must
abolish the "pork-barrel" methods In
our national defense, stop talking
and get down to the actual business
of thorough preparedness If we are
1 "to make this nation as strong as
i are Its convictions in reference to
right and wrong."
Colonel Roosevelt prefaced his
i speech by announcing that he had
' "come here to Michigan because In the
primary lor the selection of delegates

tion. Mr. Ford vu victorious, and
following on his victory here, he
showed a marked popular strength
In Kobrnska and Pennsylvania. The
etTect of this showing has been im
i mediately visible upon many of the
| politicians within and without Con
gress."
"We. through our representatives
at Washington." said Colonel Roose
velt, "have absolutely refused In the
smallest degree to prepare during
these twenty-two months of the les
son being written on the scroll of
torment in Europe. We have fatu
ously refused to take the smallest
step, either to .dolour duty to our
selves or to do our duty to other*.
We have endeavored to deceive our
selves by announcing that in tlilHj
policy oT supine Inaction and of fail
ure to perform duty, we are actuated j
by the loftiest motives. I doubt
whether wo have really docetved our- j
selves, and most certainly wo have1
not deceived others. There Is not a
nation in the world which believes
that onr course of conduct hajt been |
dictated by anything save Mmldlty. i
unworthy shrinking from effort and j
responsibility, and cold and selfish
love of money making and of soft
ease.
"In any serious crisis there are al
ways men who try to carry water on
both shoulders. These men try to es
cape the hard necessity of choice be
tween two necessarily opposlto alter
natives, by trying to work up some
compromise. In actual practice, thlB
compromise usually proves to com
bine with exquisite nicety all tho

there come great crises when com-1

necessary, we shall hit, but that wo
shall only hit soft. The only rlglit
principle Is to prepare thoroughly or
not at all. The only right principle
Is to avoid hitting If It Is possible to
do so, but never under any circum

who, he declared, had sold himself
Into bondage and was trying to barter
the Republican party to tho special
privilege seeking Interests that are
seeking to plunder tho state of lta
hntural wealth.
"This man Lilly." said tho governor,
"has beon taunting ine in every con

I am utterly opposod to Abo Lilly as a

reason that he has proved himself

no less Unworthy as governor.

That is true, but I cannot refrain
from directing your attention to the
