COUNTY'S HEAVY EXPENSE
A study of the Barry county finan
cial statement for the year 1915 re
veals the fact that the expense of
maintaining the persons from this
county at the Nevada Asylum and car
ing for the county's unfortunate poor
is enormous. A comparative study of
the financial statements for the past
few years shows that the expense for
keeping the Barry county patients at
Nevada is increasing.
Paying-for the maintenance of the
Barry county patients at Nevada for
the boys at the State Reformatory,
the patients at Mt. Vernon Sanatori
um and caring for her poor at home,
cost fhis county during the year 1915
almost $13,000. This is now the big
gest problem the county court has to ;
wrestle with. j
In discussing this matter lately a ;
number of citizens have suggested
that expenses could be greatly reduc-;
ed by bringing some of the patients I
who are at Nevada to the county j
farm. It has been suggested that!
there are persons at Nevada who are
incurable and who could be easily j
cared for here at home and save the i
county considerable money each year, j
Only a few years ago a few of the j
county patients at Nevada were j
brought here and "were taken care of i
as well here as at Nevada and at a big
saving to the county. Cassville Re
