$62,000 PAID IN TWO MONTHS
For Poultry By Merriman's Big Buy
ing House at Moreland.
Any business that can distribute
62,000 among its customers in two
months is doing some business for
these parts. Especially so when such
a business is located in a town of
200 or 300, like the hustling little
J city of Moreland in the western end
of Lincoln county. But that is just
what the firm of W. M. Merriman,
poultry and produce buyers did do
ing the months of March and April.
The I. J. representative was com
menting upon the enormous business!
which Mr. Merriman seemed to be
doing, when in Moreland the other
day. Several auto trucks were com
ing in piled high with crates of
fowls, and several freight cars on a
special siding loaded to the guards
with birds for shipment by fast
freight to Pittsburg, Pa. The I. J.
man was wondering at the size of
the business which Mr. Merriman
was doing, when that gentleman
I pulled out his bank book and showed
that his disbursemetns for the
months of March and April, paid
out to farmers and housewives, of
Lincoln and Casey counties chiefly
for chickens, ducks and geese, was
in excess of $62,000. Mr Merriman
is hustler in every sense of the
word. He operates several motor
trucks in his extensive purchasing

of the Tudor poultry pens with sev
eral hens, was held over to await
the grand jury which convenes next

EX-LINCOLNITES BUY FARM.
A Rockwood, Tenn., paper last
week had the following about two
former Lincoln county men: The
firm of William Bros., local livery
men, composed of J. B. and J. H.
Williams, have this week week clos
ed a deal whereby they become the
owners of the nice farm at Post
oak, one of the most valuable tracts
of land in this end of the county.
In the trade Miss Delia Smith re
tains five acres in the southwest
corner of the place as a homestead
during her lifetime, and after her
death this tract reverts to the pur
chasers. The William Bros., came to
Rockwood several months ago from
Norma and engaged in the livery
business. They are practical live
stock men and will convert the farm
into one for the breeding and hand
ling of all kinds of live stock. The
land is also to be improved and
while considerable farming will be
carried on, stock farming will be
the feature. The tract contains 532
acres. It lies splendidly and it sit
uated only four miles from Rock
wood on the Kingston pike. The res
idence on the place was burned a
couple "of years ago, and it is prob
able that a new home will be erect
ed on the site of the old one by the I
owners. The farm is to be eiven !
over to practical workers, and it is
stated that if plans do not miscar
ry the place will soon be one of
the beauty spots of Roane county.
The new owners of the property
have been congratulated upon their
valuable acquisition.

WANT MEN AT BIG PAY
Man From Factory at Dayton, O.,
Says Workers are Badly Needed
W. O. Davis, of the Piatt Iron
Works, of Dayton, Ohio, has been in
Kentucky for several days visiting
at his former home in Danville, and
endeavoring to secure seme work
men to take back to the big plant in
which he has an important position
He says that war orders are swamp
ing the big factories in Ohio and
that jobs can be had for the asking.
Wages from $3 to $14 a day are be
ing paid he says, according to the
skill which the workman shows. In
the iron works in which Mr. Davis
is employed nothing but the outside
shell for sharpnel shells is made; in
other factories in Dayton, the inner
shell and filler is made. His con
cern is working on an enormous con
tract with the Russian government.
It is working 2,000 men on the day
shift and 2,000 men on the night
shift. All of the material which is
manufactured in Dayton, he says is
shipped from there to Canada and
thence sent over the seas to Rus
sia by the western route across the
Pacific ocean. Mr. Davis says that he
has always noticed a number of
idlers and men out of jobs in Ken
tucky towns and he will guarantee
to furnish good paying jobs for all
who are willing to go to Dayton
and work. He will go to King's
Mountain on a visit the last of this
'week he says, and hopes to find
some workers there to take back.
He was in Stanford Wednesday.

STRANGE INDIAN CORN
Our old friend, Frank C. Dizney,
of Grays, was here this week and
brought us two large ears of seed
corn. He recommends it very highly.
He says that it bears five to seven
large, plump ears of corn to the
stalk, and that instead of having a
tassel like other corn there is a bag
forms that produces from a quart
to a half-gallon of nice shelled corn.

UPHOLD THE PRESIDENT
Says Senator Beckham In Strong
Letter on Peace Question
A dispatch from Washington
Thursday said: Senator J. C. W.
Beckham, replying to a communica
tion recently received by him with
which was enclosed a set of reso
lutions adopted at a mass meeting
of Covington and Kenton county cit
izens touching their desire to pre
serve peace and friendly relations
with Germany, sent the following
letter to the chairman of that meet
ing: "Washington, D. C, May 11, 1916.
"Mr. William A. Byrne, Chairman,
"Covington, Ky.
"My Dear Sir: I am in receipt of
your letter of a few days ago, with
which you inclosed me a copy of res
olutions adopted at a mass meeting
of many citizens of Covington and
Kenton county, held in Covington
on May 1, in which resolutions there
was earnestly and strongly express
ed the desire of those at the meet
ing that everything possible should
be done by this government to pre
public qu'estionirfromthe peopfcvTDfV'
our State, and to be guided a4 far
as possible by their wishes and views.
I, Therefore, appreciate your send
ing me the copy of the resolutions
adopted at this meeting, and I wish
to assure you that I am and have
been in hearty sympathy with the
sentiments expressed that every
things should be done to keep our
country at peace, and out of any en
tanglement in the unhappy and aw
ful European war.
"I confidently believe that Presi
dent Wilson has been as ardently in
favor of maintaining peace with
Germany, and with all other coun
tries, as any citizen in this country.
He has been criticised and, in many
instances, misrepresented by parti
sans of both sides in that conflict,
but I believe that he has sincerely
endeavored to keep this government
in a position of absolute neutrality.
"He has been bitterly assailed by
ex-President Roosevelt and many
others who have occuped high posi
tions and represent a considerable
following for not taking steps in re
gard to the invasion of Belgium,
which if he had taken, would
have undoubtedly involved this
country in war. But in the face of
hostile criticism from both sides he
has pursued a patient, patriotic and
an American course, which has hap
pily so far saved our people from j
the sacrifices and horrors of war.
"It seems to me, therefore, that
the people of this country, regard
less of politics, should uphold his
hands in the many difficult and try
ing positions in which he is placed,
and that they should commend him
for the splendid and successful man
ner in which he has so far conduct
ed our foreign affairs.
"You can rest assured that I am
in hearty accord with the sentiments
of peace advocated by the good peo
ple gathered in this mass meeting of
May 1, and that, so far as it lies in
my power as a member of the United
States Senate, I shall do all I can
to honorably maintain the peace of
our country and uphold the Presi
dent in his efforts in that direction.
"With great respect, I am
Very sincerely yours

REPORT OF TRAG
EDY ERRONEOUS
Messrs. Broughton and Chappell
Were In Auto Which Was Which
By Train and Seven Killed
The remains of James Broughton
and W. M. Chappell, who met instant
death in an auto accident near Del
ray, Florida, last Friday were
brought to their old home near
Crab Orchard Wednesday and in
terred in the cemetery after ser
vices at Ephesus church by Rev.
Mack Hutchins. The remains were
accompanied back home by Mrs.
Chappell daughter of Mrs. Brough
ton and, wife of the other victimto
whom she had been married only
eight months. A large number of
friends and loved ones turned out
to pay the last tribute of respect
to the two good citizens whose lives
were suddenly snuffed out. Under
taker J. L. Beazley, of this city,
met the remains at Crab Orchard,
and took them out to Ephesus.
According to the version of the un
forunate affair told by Mrs. Chap
pell when she arrived at Crab Or
chard, an entirely erroneous des
scription of the tragedy reached
here, and was published in the I. J.
Tuesday. Instead of being in a pony
cart which was struck by an auto,
killing both Mr. Chappell and Mr.
Broughton were in an autib with
seven other people, six men and a
woman. The woman, it seems, oper
ated an auto bus between Delray
and another point, 10 and 12 miles
in the interior where a large saw
mill was operated in which Mr.
Chappell and Mr. Broughton had
become interested. En route to that
point, they had to cross a railroad.
They thought the track was clear, but
a freight train backed around a
bend suddenly struck the car in
which the party was riding, and out
of the eight occupants of the car,
seven were killed outright, and one,
a youth, was so badly injured, that
it was expected that he too, would'
die. The woman who drove the car
was killed immediately along with

SOME FLORENCE "HOT AIR"
It now looks as if Attorney George
D. Florence, of Stanford, will be the
Republican standard bearer for Con
gress in the Eighth Congressional
district, from the way that things
are shaping up in that neck of the
woods. Mr. Florence, who is a ne
phew of former Congressman George
M. Davison, is well-known in Lexing
ton, where he has numerous friends.
Congressman Helm, of course, is a
candidate for re-election, with State

Casey county, as his opponent for
the Democratic nomination, and the
Republican leaders figure that the
"scrap" between Helm and Mont
gomery will so divide the strength
of the Democrats that Mr. Florence,
who is both capable and popular, can
win in November. The district is
nominally close, and it will be re
called that Mr. Florence's uncle Hon.
George M. Davison, twice triumph
ed over his Democratic opponent,
and it is figured by his friends th
Mr. Florence could repeat the per
formance. Lexington Leader.
