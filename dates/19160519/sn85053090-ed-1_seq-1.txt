30th, Decoration Day.
Memorial Day, Tuesday May
30th will be observed in Ekalaka
in the appropriate manner. In
vitations have been sent to the G.
A. R. and Spanish War veterans
as well as to all men who have ser

in the ceremonies of the day.
In years gone by the Local I. 0.
0. F. lodge has taken the iniative
steps and made all prepai ations
for Memorial Day observance in
Ekalaka and likewise they will
do so this year, but the hearty
co-operation of all fraternal so

0. F. cemetery are laid to rest
members of the I. 0. 0. F., Re
bekahs, G. A. R., Masons, K. of

is but right that all members
give their best endeavors to help
commemorate this one day of the
year. Members of the band or
ganization are making prepara
tions to assist in the program.
The keeping of all records and
the care of the graves has been
taken care of by the local Odd
Fellows lodge and it is but fitting
and pighly proper that the least
we can all do is to assist them on
this day to the best of our ability.
Let us all meet on May 30th at
Ekalaka and assist in the Mem
orial program.

real olrl timers of this section !

come as a surprise to many. We !

The Girl And The Game
Helen Holmes, the heroine in
"The Girl and the Gsme," is
writing the scenario for the big
screen novel herself. Frank
Hamilton Spearman is the author,
but Helen says that authors have
hearts and try to protect her
from the thrills their imagina
tions paint.
And she said she does'nt want
any. such protection—she wants
to havt the blue sky the limit as
far as taking chances with life
and limb are concerned, as long
as it is her own life.
With characteristic earnestness
she begins her thrill-makirg in
the first chapter, when she rides
her horse off a bridge into the
water after a mad race against
two speeding trains.
Of course she wins. What
heroine wouldn't? But it re
quires pluck of almost an un
natural sort to do the things she
does to inject into this great
screen novel the last word in
film realism. No wonder they
call her "the fearless film star."
To produce "The girl and the
Game," a special studio was
erected, giving to producer Mc
Gowan the greatest railroad
studio in the worid for the pro
duction of this chaptered picture.
A depot was built on the grounds
of the Signal Film corporation's
property, practicable in every
wav —switches laid, towers er
ected, semaphores installed as
all other kinds of mechanical
safeguards and hazards of the
rail.
So complete is the evjuipment
at this new studio that in the
actual taking of the first chapter
of the big film novel Producer
McGowan, thirty minutes after
the script was delivered to him
had a train consisting of pull
mans, day coaches, parlor cars,

Hatton Starts Up.
Last week Jaak Hatton unload
ed his new machinery ordered
for the production of his Ford
crank case hanger, on which he
recently received a patent from
Washington. Jack mâde a trip
to the Twin Cities late in the
winter in hopes of having some
large manufacturing plant turn
out his invention but on account
of the great boom and rush of
business that is being experienced
by these large cancerns he re
ceived no satisfaction of having
his work done until later on in
the year and possibly not at that
time, therefore Jack has taken it
upon himself to turn out these
valuable additions to every Ford
car. He has now three employees
on the job besides himself and
intends to keep a turnin' 'em out
until the supply of iron goes fluey
or they quit making Ford cars.
Jack's interest in the blacksmith
shop is now handled by H. H.
Whitsell and he will devote all
his time to the manufacture of
the crank case hanger. Orders
are coming in daily for the new
invention and as soon as they are
properly advertised Ekalaka may
look forward to having its name
in larger letters on the map.
