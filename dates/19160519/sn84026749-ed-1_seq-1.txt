to further correspondence.
Note writing is not an antidote to murder.'
Culpable weakness and timidity primarily responsible for
dreadful loss of life and for national humiliation. From speech

16 BANDITS KILLED
AND MANY TAKEN IK
BATTLEWITHPOSSE
Cowboys From Hearst Ranch in
Mexico Surprise Villistas and
Wipe Them Out.
FIELD HEADQUAIITERB. NEAIl
NAMIQUIPA. Mcxlro, May 18 (Via
wireless- to Columbus, N. M.), May 19.
Blxteon Villa bandits were killed nnd
a number captured, when a band of
twenty-five cowboys from the Hearst
ranch surprised the bandits forty miles
south of Madera.
The bandits were under the command
of Alexandro Domlnguez and Pedro
Costlllo. The cowboys (vaqucros) were
led by Uuadulupo Quesedo.
This band has been raiding Hearst's
ranch, stealing cattle, and the cowboys
wero sent out to disperse them. For
thrco days they followed them and
overtook the raiders at Rancho Vleje.
Tho bandits were surprised, and were
virtually wiped out. One of the pris
oners was Costlllo.
The captives were taken to Madera
and turned over to tho Carranza gar
rison there. While the bandits claimed
they were not Villa followers, they ad
mitted they were bound togethor to
tight both the Americans and Carran
clstaa. Trouble With Mexicans
Over Cattle at Douglas
Trouble between Americana and Mexi
cans over cattle at Douglas. Arts., was
revealed today by a War Department
message. The mestage, forwarded by
General Funston, showed there had been
some tllegal Importation of cattle which
were then held on the American side.
Possibility of a clash was noted, to
gether with the terse statement that
tho American forces were ready to cope
with It by force if necessary, though It
was doubted any serious affair would
result.
The State Department had no word
that Carranza Is preparing to renew his
demands for American troop withdrawal
from Mexico, though It is regarded as
barely possible that Mexico City condi
tions have forced him to make a new
show of firmness.
The conferenco of consuls at El Paso
should be under way soon. A report
from Consul Letcher as to the outcome
Is scarcely expected, however, before
the end of next woek.
Officials still Insist there Is no espe
clal significance to the session, but
one official declared It must have Its
effect upon the Administration. This
man. In close touch with all that the
consuls have reported, said frankly
he did not believe the consul's reports
of conditions inside Mexico could be
"very rosy."
The killing of an American soldier
ty aiexicans near Kl J'aso seemed un
likely to be provocative of any serr
ous trouDie between the two eov-
ernmentn. 'especially as the man had
apparently crossed the boundary line
wunoui orders, ana mere was nouot
that the Mexicans were the aggres
sors In the trouble.
The State Department said officially
It had had no Indication that Carranza
Is about to renew his withdrawal sug
gestion, nnd, It was stated, Consul
Rodgers' messages show a satisfactory
attitude on the First Chiefs part.
HER BACK BROKEN,
GIRL MAY RECOVER
Operation May Save Life of Nine-year-old
Child.
Cora V, Bern, nine years old, lies at
Casualty Hospital today with a broken
back. Physicians at the Institution be
lieve she has an even chance for re

on the child yesterday.
According to a report of the accident
to the police today, Corn, who lives
at 164S Half street southeast, was play
ing In a vacant stable near the' foot
or South Capitol street southeast late
Wednesday jiS lng.
A door foil upon her, nnd she .was
taken to Casualty Hospital, whero onij
or mo verteorao was round to be dis

broken. An operation yesterday re
placed the vertebra.

tice of podiatry, tho bill for tho aban

STEP TOWARD
LOWER LIGHT
RATES TAKEN
Utilities Board Reports on Valu
ation of Potomac' Eleotric
Company's Plant.
$3,000,000 UNDER CAPITAL
Commission Finds Property
Worth $9,665,088.08 Liti
gation Expected.
The cost of reproducing the
plant and equipment of the Poto
mac Electric Power Company is
$3,000,000 less than the present
capitalization of that corporation,
according to the Public Utilities
Commission of the District, which
today made public its long awaited
report on the valuation of this pub
lic utility.
This is the first step toward low
er electric rates for Washington.
According to the commission,
the company's plant and equip
ment can be reproduced for
$9,065,088.08, while the company
is capitalized at $13,000,000, divid
ed into $6,000,000 of stock and
$7,000,000 of bonds.
LITIGATION EXPECTED.
On the basis of the valuation fixed
by the commission, the work of ad
Justing rates for electric, service will
proceed.
There Is likely to be litigation In
court before lower rates for such
service can become effectlve'and also
the 'rommlaulon will give the "com
pany an opportunity to state Its side.
The expectation Is that' the company
will mnko a strenuous fight against
the commission's valuation figures.
Cost of Plant.
The Utilities Commltslon reports It
has ascertained through its accounting
department that the amount of money
expended In the construction and equip
ment of the Potomac Electric Power
Company Is I7,X.5T6.81.
The cost of reproduction of tho physi
cal property as of July 1. lf14. Is esti
mated by tho Engineering Department
at S9.96!,0S8.Og, and tho cost of reproduc
tion less depreciation, to bo S,127.3':.K.
Final valuations will bo fixed by the
commission following a hearing June J6
to permit the Potomac Electric Power
Company snd all other persons and cor
porations Interested to present before It
rvmonce wim rciercnce to the cost and
valuo of the property.
Th company will also be heard as to
what It considers a fair rate of return
upon Its property over and above tho
cost of conducting Its business. Follow
ing the hearing, which. In the opinion
of the commission, may last several
days, the rate question will be taken up
by the commission.

IN DOUBT, U. S.
NEW NOTE TO
GERMANY SEEKING PEACE
Germany ia engineering an enormous propaganda for peace in the
opinion of some high officials here.
They baso their belief that the central powers plan a speedy ending of
the war in part on the following facts:
Orders from the imperial government that all German subjects must
scrupulously obey the laws of the United States, thus putting a
stop to the hyphenated propaganda. ,
Passage of the German censor of story after stpry outlining the terms
on which peace will be discussed and suggesting that neutrals
take steps to start negotiations.
Failure of the Sinn Fein rebelHon,tho inability of tho crown prince to
take Verdun, and 'the inauguration of the British submarine war
fare that threatens to cut off entirely Germany's supply of im
portant war materials.

PEACE GERMANS
E
Negotiations Might Succeed If
Undertaken by United States
Says Correspondent.
' By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
BERLIN (via wireless to Tuckerton,
N. J.), May 19. There Is a feeling here
that If a strong neutral, such as the
United States, undertook to negotiate
peace. It might succeed.
Among diplomats hero tho recent
statements of President Poinca.ro and
Kir Kdwnrd Grey nre regarded as the
opening guns is an Informal discus
sion of peace, though the expressions
from tho allied leaders, when ranged
alongside the German chancellor's re
cent Reichstag speech, do not pi)car
altogether conciliatory.
No 'decision has been' reached as to
whether any officiate, rcplji. to .these
statements will be made nubile hv tho
German government, though It Is possible
una win oe none.
One official with whom I talked to
day declared that making peace at this
stage of the wnr would be no moro
difficult than adjusting the recent Oer-man-Amerlcan
submarine dispute. He
pointed out. however, that no belligerent
can publicly state definite terms of
peace whllo Informs! discussions con
tinue with each, side making drastic
statements of what it Intends to accom
plish as the result of the war.
I havo Just returned from u visit to
Holland, where I found that Dutchmen
believe the English, French, nnd Ger
man people all desire peace. The gen
eral Impression In Holland Is that the
time for a decisive victory for either
side has pasesd, nlthitugh each of the
belligerents may uttempt a summer of
fenslve.
The Dutch think It Is America's duty
to act now, and that tho time Is ripe
to bring the belligerents together. One
diplomat said that. If tho peace talk
now In circulation continues for a few
months, the belligerents will ilcarn
enough of what each side wants to

Trial for Ex-New Yorker.
Unless a reply is received in tho
next few hours to the representa
tions sent to Great Britain in be
half of a reprieve in the case of
Jeremiah C. Lynch, the Irish
American under sentence of death
for complicity in the Irish revolu
tion, the State Department v.:'l
send another and mere urgent
communication.
Whether Lynch is alive or dead
is not known to officials here. It
is hoped that the message received!
this morning from Ambassador
Page, transmitting a report front
the American consul at Dublin,
means that the sentence would be
imposed today, and not carried out.
CAN ASK FAIR TRIAL.
It was explained at tho State Depart
ment that while tho United States can
not demand that Lynch's life be spared
if It Is shown that he participated In
the revolution, this Government has the
right to demand the privilege of look
ing Into tho case and. If necessary. In
sisting on a fair trial.
The State Department today received
a cable from Ambassador Page, sent
before the arrival of President Wllion's
request for clemency In behalf oC
Lynch.
The following paraphrase of Dr.
Page's cable was given out:
"The consul at Dublin reports Jere
miah Lynch tried yesterday by field
court-martial for participation In the
Dublin riots. (Omission) tomorrow
morning. When sentenco is known
will advise."
Secretary Lansing1 was unable to
understand whether the word lost In
transmission was "executed" or "sen
tenced." The concluding words. In
dicating that sentence had not yet
been pronounced, led officials to be
lieve that Lynch was to be sentenced
today and not executed, in which
event there would be time for the ar
rival of President Wilson's plea In
Lynch's behalf.
Acted On O'Gorman's Plea.
At the solicitation of Senator O'Gor
man the President last night cabled
the British government for a stay In
execution until nn Investigation of
Lynch's activities could be held.
Lynch wan scheduled to bo executed
at 4 o'clock this wornlng, London time,
which was midnight last night, Wash

There was but three hours left for
