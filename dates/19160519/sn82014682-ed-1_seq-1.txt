Acres of Fire Seen Last Night
's Ever-Burning Pit-Jaggar
s From Hilo to Scene
Mokuaweoweo, the crater whieh tops Mauna Loa 's lofty peak
on the island of Hawaii, is active.
This news, startling to volcanologists as well as to the laymen
who see the volcanoes as spectacles only, was flashed by wireless
to the Star-Bulletin this morning from Hilo. At; almost the same
time came another message to this paper from a party of visitors at
the Volcano House, saying that the great pit of Kilanea is giving a
wonderful display of burning lava fields and high-spurting fire
fountains." ' " V
The first mess&S the middle of
this morning, came froin a party
who visited the volcano last night,
consisting of John K. Bui ger, U.
S. supervising inspector of steam
vessels for the first district, here
from San Francisco tor a few
days ; Thomas J. Heeney, local U.
S. inspector of boilers; William
McKay of Hilo and William
Thompson of Honolulu. This mes
sage said":
'Kilauea giving jmagnificent
display. Fountains high. Twenty
five acres of fire last night."
Only a few moments thereafter
came a wireless from the ; Star
Bulletin V Hilo correspondent
which "said : v V
' Mokuaweoweo. broke out at 7
o'clock this mornings Steam and
smoke shooting 20,000 feet up into
the air. "ilagnificent sight; Lava

The Inter-Island Steam Naviga

on the activity of Mokuaweoweo.
The company's Hilo agency wire
lessed: :;: ' . 'V..
"Mauna Loa ; broke out this
morning at 7 :15. The flow is ap
parently on the Kau-Kona side,
and is very spectacular from the
Volcano House." I
Mokuaweoweo is active only at
comparatively long intervals. Ma
,una Loa is 13,675 feet high and
the crater of Mokuaweoweo is on
the summit of the mountain. Ac
tivity here is of special interest.
LAVA FLOW
"Kahuku ranch reports lava flows
In the kau districts toward the town
of Naalenu." The following report
was received by L." W. de Vis-Norton
this afternoon from George H. Vicars
of Uflo. Upon receipt of this Informa
tion the Hawaii Publicity Commission
and Hawaii Promotion Committee be
gan working on a plan for a big ex
cursion to Hawaii' tomorrow.
A big placard has been placed in
the window of the office of the Ha
waii Promotion Committee,' announc
ing the lava flow, and it is expected
that a large number will visit this
section, going Jy the steamer Mauna
Kea tomorrow. At the time of the
last lava flow a large number took the
trip, carrying , with them tents , and
other articles of camp life..
The emotion- of Moanalua carries
out the prediction made by T. A. Jag
gar and Frank Perret, two noted vol
canologists, who made the statement
that the eruption would occur some
timo In the spring, says the Promotion
Committee. This prediction was made
one year ago.
At noon today Passenger Agent Oli
ver C. Scott of the Inter-Island re
ported that 25 persons had booked for
the Mauna Kea, steaming at 3 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon for Hilo. They
are going to make a special trip to

Theresa, of "Squatter'; Fame,
Has New Plot; Federal Site
in View Now
One hundred thousand dollars is
the price which "PrinceEs" Theresa
Wilcox Belliveau has set upon a por
tion of the site selected by. the gov
tmmpnt for Honolulu's new federal
building, and she states that she will j
endeavor to 4 collect this sum or aa
much of tt as possible in f the con

In the local IT. S. court. - K;

Tuiueaiy cia.iinia& uiw uui
The princeES' made this announce
ment: today, following 'an Interview
with the Star-Bulletin in which she
declared that, early this morning, E. I.
Spalding of the Bank of Honolulu
threatened to, arrest her for trespass
while she was viewing that portion
of the site to which she lays claim.
"I told Mr. Spalding to go ahead
and have me arrested," the 'princess
declared. "He claimed that the land
belonged to William Irwin. But 1 told
him I had a good title to that property
and that it Is on record in the courts.
Mr. Spalding told me to wait Well,
1 am still waiting."
Title by Purchase.
"Princess" Theresa claims about
half an acre of the site bordering on
the junction of Merchant and King
streets and extending along the Junc
tion from the Waikiki end of the ten
nis courts to the Ewa steps of the
Opera House. She alleged that in
1912 she purchased the property from
an old Hawaiian man named Kalae
ekekoi. which was turned over to C
Bolte in trust for her.
vWhiIe I am unable to estimate the
exact: value of the land, I think It
is worth about 1100,000," says the
princess.' "At least, that is the
amount 1 am going to claim."
Has Survey Made.
The "princess" adds that she re
cently had a survey made of that por
tion of the site which she claims.
According to the condemnation peti
tion filed In federal court against the,.
various owners of the building site,
the government stipulates that it will
pay only $200,000 for the property.
"Princess" Theresa Jumped into the
public prints a few months ago when
she "squatted" on the so-called Gore
lot, cleared the property and erected
a rent service garage and outbuild
ings. Although her action was pro
tested by the Bishop Estate which, at
that time, laid claim to ;the Gore lot,
the matter has never ieen given a
hearing 'in the courts ,

Mr. Moyle made his first trip to

New York headquarters solely in the
interest of the consummation of this
deal. He returns to his Los Angeles
branch and then to NewuYork on Tues-
dav next to clinch the final details
Two cross-continent trips were requir

effect the arrangement.
Mrs. Janowitr Efforts.
This release Is the result of the un
tiring efforts of Mrs. Janowitz, with
whom the Promotion Committee and
the Ad Club took up the matter on
her visit to Honolulu last September.
Encouraged by her representations,
Messrs Shingle, Berndt and Taylor
Journeyed to the Pacific coast and to
the Universal City studios at Los An

supervised by her brother, Isadore
Bernstein, one of the greatest direc

producers, etc., resulted.
Plan Meets Approval.
The plan as enthusiastically approv
ed by the originators and ail approach
ed secures international presentation
through Pathe '(the oldest and most
successful film releasing organization
in the world) of a five-reel feature
film regularly each month to be pro
duced on the Islands by the Aloha
company.
Aside from the tremendous publicity
afforded Hawaii, the favored stock
holders consisting exclusively of Ha
waiian residents, will share in the
profits of the enterprise. It is a well
known fact that as much as a million
dollars has been made on investments
of from eighteen thousand to one hun
dred thousand dollars for one single
subject, and the Aloha plan embraces
twelve subjects!
These are to be worthy artistically
