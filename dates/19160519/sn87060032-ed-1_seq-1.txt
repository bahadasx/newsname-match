The following arc the rules
which will govern the close of the
contest:
Contestants cannot be too care
ful about sending in their ballots
so that they will reach the con
test department before 3 p. m.,
Saturday. May 20th. and as a
matter of precaution, everyone
of them should read and weigh
carefully each line of what we
have to say.
We would dislike to see any
candidate lose a single vote be
cause of the excitement which is
sure to occur during the last few
hours of the campaign, or be
cause of some misunderstanding
on their part. It is impossible
for you to exercise too much pre
caution in arriving at a full un
derstanding of the rules and con
ditions governing the campaign.
First All votes and remit- hour they may be out ot town or judges in the contest Saturday,

Look over the above conditions

conclusion that you understand
any particular one until you are
absolutely sure of its full mean
ing. If the precaution of read

regrets concerning the votes be

conform to the rules of the cam
paign. If in doubt concerning any
point ask questions until every
thing is clear.
Get your votes in the ballot box
early Saturday, so you will not
miss any of them. Do not lose
any of them, for there will be no
way of getting duplicates at this
last period of game. Do not
trust to slow mails, and especial

them in time to reach this office
before 3 p. m. on Saturday.
Do not ask to have vote ballot
issued on subscription without
the names of the candidates for
whom they are to be voted writ
ten thereon. The request can-
not be complied with.
All votes must bear the name
of the candidate before they
leave this office. Scratched, torn
or alternated coupons will be
promptly discarded.
Often times a few votes will ,
win or lose a prize, and it is
small satisfaction for one to know
what they have lost by putting
off their final efforts until the
last hour. Go out at once and do
your wavering friends into line
who promised you a subscription.
If you put it off until the last
preparing for the struggle which
must take place between now
and 3 p. m Saturday, May 20th.
Indications point to a strenous
finish and many new subscribers
will be added to our lists in the
few hours still remaining. Claims
and counter claims of contestants
and their friends indicate that
the outcome is everywhere in
doubt and public interest will be
at white heat.
ONLY A FEW HOURS LEFT.
But it will be all over in a short
while, and tho it has been a
warm race, the good feeling will
be prevalent and everybody will
be merry, and those who have
worked the hardest will be the
merriest of all.
THE LAST WORD.
This is final and positive no
vote will be received at this office

We are in receipt of a copy of
the Daily Christian Advocate,
dated at Saratoga Springs. N.Y..
May 13th, 1916. And in the roll
call of the conference. Mr. Deck
er introduce;! a resolution which
reads as follows: "A. M. Dick
er Kentucky Confere ce, advo
cated the change of th. words
'Holy Catholic Church' in the
Apostles Creed, making the read
ing 'The Universal Church' and
the matter was referred with the
revisions of the ritual to the board
of bishops, with the request that
this board give this question ear
nest consideration." We hope
that Mr. Decker will be success
ful in this, his efforts to have
this change made, and we are
sure that if ame is done that his
name will go down in the future
history of the world as a man
worthy of the highest honors
that could now or at any future
period be conferred upon one who
advocates such changes as are
misleading, and have a meaning
and significence different to that
which it appears to have.
This word has no place in the
ritual of the Methodist Church,
while it is a good word and means
"Universal" yet the word uni
versal is no harder to speak, or
write than the word "Catholic"
and why not use the good old
word "Universal" wheftitsounds
so much better to a protestant.
We say three cheees for A. M.
Decker.
Auto Collision.
One day last week, Bige Bing
ham went to Cincinnati, and soon
after he arrived he found that
the streets there were a little
more congested than those here
and in his hurry he went head
on with another fellow and as a
result Bige is in the hospital in
Cincinnati, and his man is also
broken up and is laid up for re
pairs. Tho machine which was
driven by Bingham was not hurt
and Mr. J. E. Archer went to
Cincinnati and drovo it home, ar

SAMPSON THE
FRIEND OF LABOR
The Great Masses of La
boring Men of Seventh
Appellate District Lin
ing up for Him for Judge
of Kentucky Court of
Appeals.
There is scarcely a well in
formed laboring man in the
whole 27 counties composing the
Seventh Appellate District who
does not know and recognize
Judge Sampson as a friend of
labor. The poor man has the
same hearing and standing in
his court as the great, rich and
powerful. It does not matter
how ragged or poorly-clad a man
is, if he be honest and upright,
he will be respected and recog
nized as the equal of the proud
and rich in Judge Sampson's
court. This has been demonstra
ted dozens of times in the Cir
cuit Court over which Judge
Sampson presides. If he is elec
ted to the Appellate bench those
who toil to earn their bread by
the sweat of the brow will have
a friend and sympathizer in that
court. This has not always been
true, in other courts, Corpora
tions have put thousands of dol
lars into campaigns to elect
judges in order that they may
have protection, and the man
that accepts such contributions
does so with the distinct under
standing that the corporation
expects something in return, and
this expectation has not always
failed of fulfillment. The great
and Dowerful have occupied the
attention of the courts while the
weak and humble citizen has
been ignored and his rights
trampled upon.
Judge Sampson in the dispatch
of business in his court has tried
hundreds of cases between the
laboring man and the corpora
tion, and a review of the records
or his court will disclose that tho
weak and humble; crippled, lame
and halt have received fair and
iust consideration and have made
no complaint and have none to
make.
He has established a rule in
his court procedure, in close cases
between the rich and the poor,
of resolving all close questions
of doubt in favor of the poor and
weak instead of the rich and
powerful, because, as he has
often repeated, if a mistake be
made against the poor man he
has no money with which to pay
the lawyers or to take an appeal
to the higher courts and have the
error corrected, but if the error
be made in the Circuit Court
against the rich and powerful
these already have their lawyers
employed and paid and they have
the money with which to pay for
transcripts of records and to
prosecute appeals and to have
the error corrected if there be
one. This is the humane side of
it; the side that appeals to the
heart and conscience of every
right thinking man. And the
laboring people and those who
toil are well acquainted with the
facts and know that Judge Samp
son will give them a square deal
and that their rights will be res
pected. When these facts are
well understood, no one will
doubt for a minute that Judge
Sampson will have the solid sup
port of the hundreds and thous
ands f men who work in the
shops, coal mines, on the mil
roads, at the mills, and on the
farms,
Bell County Roads.
From the report of the election
held in Bell County last Saturday
the 13th, it appears that all that
has been done and said deroga
tory to the building of the pikes
in that County has been knocked
into a cocked hat and that the
people of Bell County are de
termined to have good roads.
The vote stood about fifteen to
one in favor of an additional road
bond issue of $160,000 to com
plete the roads. The people of
that County should be compli
mented on this move, for the
good roads are our only salva
tion in this neck o' the woods.
At the rate things are moving it
will not be long until we will have
exhausted everything except
our scenery, and as soon as the
Dixie Highway is completed we
will begin to realize that the on
ly thing that has saved this part
of the country is our natural
scenery. Take the Cumberland
River as it winds its way down
from the lofty peaks of the Black
Mountains, passing through the
many falls and gorges, walled in
by the many high peaks of the
Pine Mountain, which it appears
to have in time worn its way
through on down to the beauti
ful broad and fertile valleys,
which is bedecked with many
little towns and hamlets, with
its waters teeming with fish,
and its mountain sides inhabited
by the Quail, Pheasant, Squirrel, I
Rabbit, and all the song birds
that make life to the wearied
traveler give praise to the great
God of the universe for making
and blessing us with all this for
the benefit of mankind. The
tourist will feel after he shall
have come and gone that this is
indeed the equal of all the world
for its splendid beauty of scenery
It is well to state that the Dixie
Highway as laid out from Cum
berland Gap to Crab Orchard is
the old wilderness trail in so far
as is practible, and monuments
have already been erected to
mark the trail that Daniel Boone
made when he came to the far
away west and settled up Ken
tucky. Let Knox County follow suit,
if we have not enough money
judiciously to complete our part
of this highway let us get busy
and make arrangements to get it

X ROLL OF HONOR BANK
Is one whose surplus is equal to its capital
stock. "The Financier", a paper published in New
York, gets from the Government the names of all
banks whose surplus is equal to its capital, and pub
lishes them as HONOR ROLL BANKS. Thus if a
bank has a capital of $15,000.00 and a surplus of
$15,000.00 it is an "Honor Roll Bank" just the same
as a bank with a MILLION DOIXARS of CAPITAL
and a MILLION DOLLARS of SURPLUS.

Golf Links for
Barbourville.
Last Sunday Mr. T. W. Minton,
proprietor of the Hickory Mills
here, exhibited to us a set of
golf clubs made from hickory
that was sent to the factory
from this place.
Arrangements have been made
to open up golf links here in
the near future. Mr. Minton,
the projector, is very enthusias
tic over the matter, and he is .
sure that it will be a success.
There is no doubt but that the
hickory from which the handles
of the sticks are made is of the
very finest to be found, and is a
great advertisement of our re
sources. Mr. Minton has secured about
120 acres of land just-on the out
side of the City known as the
"Tan Yard Hill" which he says
is one of the best locations to be
found anywhere: and that ho
now has a subscription that as
sures him that the matter will be
a go and that improvements will
start soon on the plot of land.
