The Grandin Picnic.
Possibly the largest, best attended
basket picnic of the political nature
held during the present campaign was
that at Grandin on Wednesday. Peo
ple were there from Melrose, Put
nam Hall, Florahome and many other
west county points. These with the
home people and the candidates, made
a big crowd estimated at 250.
The dinner was served on long ta
bles under the oaks just up from the
station and when dinner was ready,
Rev. L. E. McRae asked God's bles
sing on the assembly.
It was a splendid dinner and was
heartily enjoyed, especially by the
large crowd trom raiatKa, who i.uc
i.t un,-a Annnrtnnit.v to indulge in the
luxury of such good cooking of such
toothsome dishes, many of which are
peculiar to the home, and of the kind
"Mother makes." .
After the dinner the speaking took
place from an improvised platform,
in front of which were arranged seats.
Most of the candidates made their
spiels, and the audience, long suffer
ing: and patient, never offered to mob
any of us.

ELECTEDPRES1DENT
State Medicinal Association
Dr. E. W. Warren's
Career.
Dr. E. W. Warren of this city was
elected president of the State Medi
cal Association at the annual meet
ing of the Association in Arcadia last
week. This is a 'most distinguished
honor, and one this well-known Palat
kan will wear worthily.
Dr. Warren came to Florida from
Georgia immediately after his gradu
ation in 1902, and has practiced in
this State continuously since, most of
the time in Palatka and Putnam coun
ty. He was appointed to the staff of
the State Board of Health in Febru
ary, 1903, since which time, in one
place or another he has been identi
fied with public health work. He wad
appointed a member of State Board of
Medical Examiners in 1909 by the
late Gov. Broward, and has continued
en the board ever since by reappoint
ments both of Gov. Gilchrist and Gov.
Trammell. He became secretary of
the board and its executive officer on
the death of the late Dr. J. D. Fer
nandez of Jacksonville in December,
1913.
He represented the Florida Medical
Association at the Midwinter Confer
ence in Chicago in 1915 and 1916.
Since Dr. Warren's election to the
secretaryship of the State Medical
Association he has worked unceasing
ly to overcome some of the antago
nisms which have existed between the
different schools of medicine with the
result that he has succeeded in large
measures in making friends among
the various1 state boards of medical
examiners, and securing harmonious
action among them in administering
the medical practice acts as they ap
pear on the statutes.
The election of Dr. Warren to the
presidency of the State Association
is only another and more pronounced
manner of recognizing his worth to
the profession by his associates of the
regular school. Palatkans will appre
ciate the honor bestowed upon their
fellow citizen.
Dr. Frank D. Rix Honored.
The interest of thousands of club
women of America centers around
New York city where in the Biennial
Convention of the National Federation
of Women's Clubs, which gathers in
that city next week, will be heard
many of the world's brightest think
ers along the lines of the various de
partments of club activity. Palatka
will have the honor of having one of
her winter residents represented in
the convention in the person of Dr.
Frank D. Rix, who has spent several
winters at his home in Edgewater.
Dr. Rix will lecture on Music, a sub
ject on which he is authority, being
the supervisor of music in the New
York public schools. Dr. Rix is well
known to many Palatkans.
That Johnson Picnic.
Last Saturday the people of Johr.
s.vi Station gave a barbecue and ba.--hot
picnic, inviting the county 'mdi
,ia(i to bo present. Of course those
ucaticnieii all al tended and enjoyed
themselves and before leaving did not
i';il to say so. There was a large at
tendance of the people from the sur
rounding country and after dinner
these candidates were called upon to
deliver themselves of thoughts which
were uppermost in their minds.
Hon. William Johnson and Hon.
Thos. Rountree were the chef's, while
Charley Livingston and Maj. D. Wil
liams sat by and enjoyed the flavor
of the roasting meat.
Mr. W. 11. Worley, candidate for
county commissioner, acted as chair
man and introduced the speakers.
REV. J. T. LEWIS
I
Asj Rector of St. Mark's
Church Will Join Brit
i ' ish Army.
Palatkans who have come to greatly
admire and respect the Rev. J. T.
Lewis, for the past year or more rec
tor of St. Mark's Episcopal church,
will jl earn with regret that he has ten
dered his resignation to take effect the
last of June.
The resignation was tendr
recent meeting of the church vestry
and a committee was appointed to
draft resolutions on the severance of
pastoral relations.
Mr. Lewis, who is a Welchman, has
lived in this country some five or six
years. For some four years he was
the popular pastor of the Episcopal
church in Monticello. When he left
that place to come to Palatka there
was very sincere regret on the part
of all the people of the place, and
on the ' Sunday morning when he
preached his farewell sermon, the
other protestant churches of the place
dispensed with their services and at
tended the Episcopal farewell service.
Mr. Lewis will go direct to England
where he expects to join the army and
where he has assurances that he will
be given a commission as chaplain.
He is an able preacher and under
his pastorate St. Marks church has
thrived.
Major Chesser Goes to Reunion.
Maj. James M. Chesser of Hollister,
one of Putnam county's notable fig
ures, and one of our ofdest Confed
erate veterans with a record of ac
tive service, is spending this week in
Birmingham, Ala., in attendance up
on the annual meeting of the United
Confederate Veterans. Mr. Chesser
passed through Palatka on Sunday
on his way to Birmingham. He also
attended the annual reunion last year
in Richmond, Virginia.
That there will not be more than
one or two more of these annual re
unions is now quite generally be
lieved. These old veterans of the
Confederacy are getting along in
years and are becoming too feeble to
attend these meetings and take part
in the parade. Mr. Chesser, while
seemingly quite well, is in fact up in
the80's.
On Wednesday the grand parade
took place in Birmingham, and as the
"thin gray line" passed along the
streets the veterans were greeted with
continuous cheering. Montgomery,
cradle of the Confederacy, seeks the
honor of the next reunion.

Mr. Brakeman Discourses.
Editor Talatka News:
1 farmed it all last week out among
the good people and fresh air of Flo
rahome and am pleased to report that
a feeling of optimism prevails, al
though crops have suffered seriously
from the protracted dry weather.
They were so well pleased with con
ditions at the recent meeting there
'.'oat some advocate the annexation of
Mexico and possibly a portion of Cen
1 1 :.i America in order that offices may
he created for all.
i i lur old and esteemed friend, Mr.
Tucker is able to be out and around
; ii'l converse with his many callers.
A walk over the south prarie served
to increase our enthusiasm to see a
., corn field with it's dark green fo
liage rustling in the breeze, as the
I road, level expanse now looks its
host. Moisture was up to the sur
face, but digging down showed water
to be a foot and a half below, and the
soil looked to be the richest that I
ever stuck a spade into.
Nearly a mile away I could see the
dredge, but its musical voice was still
ed. Being interested in its progress
and as through its aid I hope to be
able to make two blades of grass grow
where but one grew before, I took a
stroll down to it. A broken cable
caused a delay. It is leaving a fine
ditch behind it, and I am disposed to
speak favorably of what I saw. It
rests in about nve teet ot water ami
requires about three feet in which to
float. The water in the canal had
ceased to run, and the remaining pud
dles looked to be unfit for stock to
drink. Cattle could be seen in all di
rections and they look fine; the way
they kicked up their heels indicated
that they knew a good thing when
they had it, and their rounded out
sides that they had no fear of dys
pepsia. Now it costs no more to feed a cow
worth fifty or seventy-five dollars
than one worth half that sum, and
the presence of cattle tick is all that
birders the stock raisers from hav
ing them. We are told that ticks in-fc-ting
other animals do not remain
upon cattle, and that one dollar per
head will clear the herds of them. 1
reirard it as one of the most essen
tial as well as beneficial movements
that can lie inaugurated in Florida.
Let the good work go on and may
the coming legislature take decided
action to clear our fair state of this
troublesome and expensive pest.

L. C. STEPHENS,
628 Kirby Street.
Governor Park Trammell was call
ed to Washington Saturday night on
important public business. but before
leaving gave out the following state
ment on the situation arising in St.
Auguetihe recently from complaints
made to the governor regarding the
teaching of negro schools by white
teachers in violation of the law and
the refusal of those continuing to
teach the school to stop such practice
when called upon to do so. The gov
ernor deemed the statement necessary
because of some press dispatches sent
out from St. Augustine somewhat
misleading in their wording.
The governor's statement follows:
"In the month of March of this
year a complaint was received at the
governor's office signed by six names,
the first paragraph of which com
plaint was as follows:
'We the undersigned citizens of St.
Augustine and the state of Florida,
appeal to you as our governor, pledg
ed to enforce the laws of the state rel
ative to enforcing the law pertaining
to white persons teaching negroes in
this state.'
"Then followed what the petitioners
had to say relative to the facts.
"Following the same course I pur
sue in all similar complaints I for
warded this complaint to the sheriff of
St. Johns county, with the request
that he "kindly investigate this com
plaint and give the same proper at
tention.
"March 29th, I received from Sher
iff Perry of St. Johns county, a re
port. The substance of the sheriff's
report was embodied in the following
language:
"The facts are, white persons have
the direction of this school; it is at
tended solely by members of the ne
gro race; it is a private school and
those in charge contend that they are
within the law.
"I am advised that an act was pass
ed in 1913, Chapter 6490, prohibiting
white teachers teaching negro chil
dren in negro schools. This is a
school operated by the Roman Cath
olic church and is not a negro school
but a private school where negro chil
dren are taught by the Sisters of St.
Joseph, who are white teachers.'
"The sheriff concluded his report
in the following language:
'I advise you of these facts, fol
lowing my investigation, and I ask
that you advise and direct me what
course to take immediately.'
"After getting the report from the
sheriff and having before me the facts
as reported by him, I replied to him
on April 4th, and, after reviewing tho
sheriff's report, concluded in the fol
lowing language:
"'The facts set forth in your let
ter show the school in quest cm to be
a negro school operated by the Ro
man Catholic church and taught by
white teachers.
''Section 1 of chapter ih.iO of the
laws of Florida, acts of l.tL! .pro
vides as follows: j
" 'Section 1. From and after the
passage of this act it shall be unlaw
ful in this state for white teachers
to teach negroes in negro schools, and
for negroes to teach in white schools.
" 'It appears from the facts as you
state them, that tho school in question
ie being conducted in violation of the
said chapter 6 11)0. The application of
the law is not restricted to public
schools, but applies as well to private
schools and was intended to prevent
white teachers from teaching negroes
in all negro schools.'
" 'Answering your request that I
let you know as to what step you
should take in this matter, I beg to
rdvise that you proceed as in other
cases of law violation."
Yours very trulv,
"PARK TRAMMELL,
Governor.
It appears that Sheriff Perry after
finding that those carrying on the
school would not willingly submit to
the law, decided to place the teachers
technically under arrest and the coun
ty judge released them on their own
recognizance awaiting the trial of the
case.
The case came up for hearing be
fore Judge Gibbs this week, but was
not decided. The judge has taken the
matter in hand and will probably
make a decision in a few days.
7 MAKE
AGAINST
Unless You are Prepared to
Pay Penalty.
Gov. Park Trammell in a recent

him to advocate or oppose through
the columns of his paper any candi

tion, and no such owner, editor or

cept such payment or reward. Any
person violating the provisions of this
section shall upon conviction bo pun
ished by a fine of not exceeding one
thousand dollars, or be imprisoned not
exceeding one year, or be punished by
both fine and imprisonment. And a
candidate who is found guilty of such
violation shall from and after his con
viction be DISQUALIFIED AND IN
ELIGIBLE TO HOLD OFFICE or po
sition to which he aspires, or any oth
er State or county office, or position,
and his name shall not be allowed or

tion, shall issue any such certificates
or commissions to such person: If
at the time of conviction, such per
son who was a candidate is serving
in the position or office to which he
aspired, his conviction shall be cause
for removal or for his impeachment.
Gov. Trammell has issued his in
fractions to the sheriffs of tho
St:it to watch closely for violations
cf this law, and to prosecute.
Mr. Rogers Failed to Qualify.
To the Democratic Voters of School
District No. One:
Having misunderstood the time
in which to qualify for the above of
fice, I unintentionally let the day pass
in which I should have qualified.
This was done through a misunder
standing and not through careless
ness. I now take this means of thanking
my many friends and supporters for
the kind assistance given me, and, I
wish to ask you to turn out on June
6th, and give my opponent, Dr. D.
C. Main, your solid vote and support.
Also in the General Election give
Doctor Main the same splendid sup
port that you have been so kind to
give me.
Again thanking you for your sup
port and wishing my opponent a
splendid vote, I beg to remain,
Yours very sincerely,
W. F. ROGERO.

A Near Tragedy.
What might have proven a very ser
ious shooting occurred yesterday
morning at the old Calhoun residence
corner of Third and Madison streets.
This house is let as a rooming house,
the lower floor being occupied by A. G.
Leverett, a saw filer. The upper
rooms are occupied by several young
men, including Attorney A. H. Odom
and Frank S. Chapman.
Mr. Chapman was out on the front
porch and was just starting for break
fast when Mr. Leverett came out to
the door. He had a pistol in his hand
which he pointed at Mr. Chr.pman.
This gentleman skidded across the
street and went to the home of Mrs.
Coxe, where he boards, and where he
attempted to call up Chief Livingston.
While thus engaged he heard several
shots fired; he ran back to the Cal
houn house then where were a num
ber of other people who had been at
tracted by the shooting. Leverett
stood at the head of tho stairs with a
pistol in hand. He was overpowered
by D. W. Ramsaur and several others.
The shots, four in number had been
fired at Mr. Odom. Two took effect,
inflicting only flesh wounds, one of
which was in his shoulder, ai.d one in
his cheek. The shots had penetrat
ed the door to Mr. Odom's room.
Ieverctt is a sick man, and has been
temporarily deranged. He was insane
when the shooting took place.
Mr. Odom's wounds are ugly but
not serious; but he had a narrow es
cape. As it is he will be marked for
life. He is one of Palatka's most ac
tive law practitioners and a man well
known over the State. The insane
man will be cared for.
