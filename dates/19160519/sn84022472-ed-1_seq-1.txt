liOndon, May 19. Discussing the sit-
' taation .in - Ireland in the ;House of
' Commons today, Mr. Birrell said:
"If the home rule bin bad not been.
plaied on' 'the. statute books ' there
- -would have been a. great explosion of
JS
OF
UPRISING
a raga and disappointment both in Ire-
land and in the United States, which,
when "war came, - would have assumeu
alarming proportions. The events In
Ulster and the gu-runnlng at Lame
by the Ulster! tea in-1904 undoubtedly
liad an effect - on disloyalists else-
. -where." . ' . : . - i '
. Ireland had -preserved, an unbroken
front at the outbreak of the war
f through the patriotism of John Red
mond, Mr. Birrell continued, but there
were many) who did not agree with, his
attitude, tt was impossible to- over
estimate the effect which the advent
of the Ulster leader, Sir Edward Car-
' . eon, had -exercised on the minds of the
people of Ireland.
7hen it was seen that the war
-would be prolonged, Mr. Birrell said,
Ireland soon developed not unreason
able expectations of- a German lan d-
' lng and promises of German assist
ance were; at the bottom,' of the out
break. !
Answering Baron HardingS, Mr.
: .Birrell said: A ' ' .
"Sinn Kelnism bad spread all over
the place, . The Sinn Felners were
sick of '-parliamentary parties - and
they desired to be left alone. I real-
"ized for twoyeara certainly that there
- " was dangerous - movement in Ire
land, but after consultation with the
various Irish leaders I came to the
conclusion that a policy of non-intervention
was the safest. These armed
bodies of volunteers were all over the
place and If we could Jkave got dis
; armament all round ft would have
been an ; Infinite blessing, but to dis
arm any one section of the population
on i the evidence we had-would nave
ben at dangerous and. doubtful propo-
- eition," " . . v . -
Baron Hardinge: "Ton need :not
answer this question, but why were
the Irish leaders who advised yon in
this policy to be relied upon?"
'- Mr. Birrell: "In the first place I
had formed a pretty clear estimate of
my own and I don't think I was ever
much influenced by other people. v But
Mr. Redmond, for example, always
took the view that the Sinn Fein era
' were negligible and ho said so in the
House of Commons. I did not attach
much Importance to his opinion be
cause I was quite sure they were dan
gerous."-
Continuing, Mr Birrell saidVhe "had
daily reports from the Royal Irish
' constabulary -and these reports were
- of such at character that one could
. 'form a general estimate of the state
-of feeling-, in the countryside.'
"The- (gate of feeling varied very
' much" he added. "If a. priest was
, an anti-Sinn Fein er,. Sinn Feiclsm died
out, but if the priest was in favor of it
. the movement was promoted. But in
Dublin it was different. . I always felt
that I was very ignorant of what was
going on in ther' cellars of Dutn and
- I was exceedingly nenrotw abofat that.
I had heard that the castle was to be
. ;. taken. 1
"Steps were taken to deal with these.'
reports but nothing came of them and
, " I should be very curious to Jearn ' if
anybody knew this thins was gomg
to happen, ' - .
, "I had Very decided views, so much
mo that I had conferences with Gener
als Kitchener and French on March
20 and March 27 to persuade them to
end more soldiers to Dublin.. I knew
the people of Dublin should' have evi
dene that England still had soldiers
amd. if soldiers with bayonets and
bands could be ' got to parade the
streets of Dublin it would 'have had a
, great, effect on the Sinn Feiners.

Miss- McCoy, told a Farmer reporter
that for" seven years she looked for

"Death in the island is a catastro

. Speaking of her plane to be married
to Christian when she returned. Miss
McCoy said that courtship in the is

LAWYERS AWAIT
JUSTICE M'MANUS
Document Returned tp City
Court From His Court is
Minus Contents.
Legal ( and judicial circles are agog
today over a controversy . between
mem hers of twojr of the beet known
law firms in thisj city, which, arising
out of a simple suit in' summary pro
cess, -has resulted in many startling
situations, chief among wlbich Is 'the
partial destruction of city court files.
As a result of the controversy juris
diction of both the city court and of
Justice of the Peace Edward J. Mc
Manus have been questioned ; and
through decisions and motions made
in the two courts the lower one is
now asked tacitly to reverse the decis
ion of the higher one.
During the legal moves that' have
been made the merits of the original
case, -which was that of Susan W.
Bishop against George W. Smith, have
been submerged, tlhough many lawyers
declare today that the x controversy
will prove of strategic .value to one
side or "the other.
The attorneys Involved are Philo C.
Calhoun and J. WalterlScheffer of the
law firm of Marsh, Stoddard & Day,
and "Vincent L. Keating of ihe firm of
Cullinan' & Cullinan. ''-The mutilated
docket which is likely to become the
subject of judicial inquiry within the
near future, was on file with City
Court Clerk Theodore B. Steiber. All
that remainrf -m that office of tb,e or
iginal papers the folder from which
the summons' and complaint has been
torn out.
,The suit -waa one of summary pror
cesa to remove ; George H. Smith, a
well known -shoe - repairer, from the
first floor in which- action was made
at the instigation,; of Mrs. . Bishop by
Deputy Sheriff Cunningham, March 8.
Smith alleges that the action resulted
when the owner was offered more ren
tal by .a. prospective restaurant owner.
The action was returnable before Jus
tice McManus at 10. -O-'cloclc. May 16.
vA explained yesterday by the jus
tlce a ' provision ; of . .the city charter
permits tne transfer of a case to the
City-court under certain conditions.
,' On May 13,- Vincent I. Keating, a
young member of the Fairfield County
Bar- association, - appeared in he of
fice of McManus to transfer the case
to the city courtj 'Notice is said to
(have been Iuly served bit in the ab
sence of McManus from his office the
complaint was left in the justice courts
docket. - ..','.''' '
Such a transfer is said to be per
mitted provided it bo made 48 hours
prior to the' date and time set for
hearing of the action. '
In this . instance it is claimed that
time but that the papers were not' le
gally removed, the time of" hearing be
ing set for 10 o'clock May 15, whereas
Mr. Keating' on May 13 is said not to
have removed the docket until 11:37,
as noted on -the complaint.
Upon learning of this fact through
Attorney Calhoun, an exception to. the
Jurisdiction of the city court was im
mediately entered on behalf of Mrs.
Bishop. The' plea was heard before
Judge Wilder, iwho ordered counsel to
return the pampers to the city court
docket when he endorsed them: "Plea
to Jurisdiction' sustained and dismiss
ed from Docket." '
It is at this point of the controversy
that tactics are said to' have -been re
sorted to resulting iiv partial destruc
tion of th6 court records. .
Though counsel were, ordered by
the cour$ to return the records they
were spirited away from the docket.
Attorney J. Walter Scfheffer, of that
firm, Was ordered forthwith to 'return
them to -the city court. This order
was complied with but not until the
complaint had been :torn from the
folder.
- This'Sact has created a furor in court
and legal circles, there .being no pre
cedent, it is said', where dockets (have
been destroyed in courts here
As a result of . Judge Wilder's de
cision on the original plea. Attorney
Keating, of the office of Cullinan &
& Cullinan, has filed in the justice's
court a plea to jurisdiction of the jus
tice court, claiming that the case had
legally been transferred to the city
court under the statutes. Justice
McManus has beein asked. to set a time
for 'hearing on this plea. -,1
In. ah interview with a reporter for
the Farmer yesterday Justice Mc
Manus substantiated the facts of the
case.' . .- -
" City, Court Clerk Steiber asked to
make a statement relative to tfie mu
tilation of his files said:
"All I know about this case is that
Mr. Scheffer of the firm of Marsh,
Stoddard & Day,, took the files intact
from my office during my absence and
returned them in their present con
dition. J- have nothing further to
say. Any other information will have
to be gleaned from Mr. Scheffer r the
parties involved."
"The pdd legal situation of a plain
tiff having his own case thrown out
of court is also presented in this con
troversy. About 75 per cent, of suits
brought In, justice court are transfer
ed under the city churter to the city
court. They are seldom returned to
the initial court and the ruling of Jus
tice McManus on the pleadings which
is expected to bring forth much in
teresting law geyerning the conduct
of justice and" city courts, as laid
down in the city charter and Connec
ticut sotatutes, is awaited by local at
torneys with great interest.

- Prosecutor McOrmon is seeking to learn if a specific order
to fire was given ,and, if so, by whom. He also wants to learn
whether the guards were told to fire directly ai the strikers, or
to shoot into the air.
While he was conducting his investigations, Coroner Eli

Mr. Jockmus. it is understood, ts

strikers, who will meet this afternoon,
accept this proposition, it is likely that
the plant will -be in' operation, tomor

next week the adjustment of the de
mands would be made.
-The strikers deny flatly - that they
did any firing outside the gates of the
company. They claim that they were
simply parading to show their
strength. - - -
- The " police have several bullets
taken from the wounded v men. .They
are of .88 calibre, which is the same
as In cartridges used in the revolvers
of the guards.
It is also claimed that some of the
men deputized are of different .na
tionalities and that are just anxious to
shoot. The city authorities reply to
thestrUters to the effect that there
was some firing among the paraders
who began the battle.
The. strikers? committee is made up
of two members of four nationalities
each, Greeks, Lithuanians, Ruthen
ians and Italians.
' The office of the British Inspector
is" on the second floor of the plant and
it was noticed tday that the stoning of
the windows there was very effective.
No one was in the office at -the time..
Before the parade started warrants
for some of the strikers had been Is
sued but had not been served. Prob
ably they will not be served at the
present time. ,
Throughout the forenoon there was
entire absence of disturbances eltner
upon the city streets or In the vicinity
of the plant. The strikers did not
oongregate at any point.
Today a number of men arrived
from Boston and New York- to do
guard duty for the company. They
went to a hotel upon arrival and later
came out in blue uniforms. The com
pany's manager went to Mayor Schu
maker and asked him to swear in
these men as deputies but the mayor
said he would have to look into this
request closely as he did not feel like"

A. R. LemieuiV general manager o
the plant, said tfiat the company had

. STRIKE TIES VP FUSE SHOP.
Simsbury, Conn., May 19 The
plant of the Ensign-Bickford Co.,
makers of fuses, was practically closed
rbday as the result of the strike of
operatives in the company's cotton
mills yesterday. It was also pay day
and most -of the employes were at the
mill to get --their money. The com
pany has its own cotton mills to make
cloth used in fuses which are turned
out bv other departments. There are
about 100 textile workers.N These de
manded an increase in wages which
the company has declined to grant.' Ja
year ago there was a general in
crease of 15 per cent, and of late the
help have had a 6 per cent, bonus.
The strikers are mestly Polanders and
Italians. .
The stoppage of the cotton mills
made the fuse makers short of ma
terial. This will compel closing down
the other departments employing
about 30.
