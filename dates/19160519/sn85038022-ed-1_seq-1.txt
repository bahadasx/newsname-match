Hjr Federation This Morning Tlmrs
dnj's Addresses and Illrtlidny
Party Mndo Up Very Inter
esting Program.
Tho address of tho president, Mrs
Morris V. Dartlctt, was ono of the
main features of tho Thursdny morn
Ing session of tho Federation of Wo
mon'B Clubs held In tho First Presby
terian Church. Mrs. Dartlctt said that
during tho year twcnty-flvo now clubs
had como Into tho Federation and
nouo had withdrawn. She snld thnt
thoro was no financial reason why
nny woman In tho Federation might
not be president. Sho reported tun
during tho yenr over 1.900 letters and
cards had been sent out by nur lime
penrdent of the corresponding secre
tary nnd had traveled between 3,000
nnd 4.000 times, causing n great out
law of time and expense, but that she
felt fully compensated because of the
good work that had been nccompllsn
cd. Sho recommended the Illiteracy
work nnd raado a strong plcn for help
alone that line.
Tho rest of the morning as tuken
up with reports from district cluilrmen
nnd ofneors.
Tho Thursday afternoon program
was ono of tho bost since tho session
stnrted. Following tho prayer by .Mrs,
I'oddlcord the report of tho Civic Do
partmcnt was mado by Mrs. Androw
Campbell, .Mrs. Albert Morohoad's
talk on "Educational Motion ricturcs
was very Instructive and onjoynble.
Probably the most Interesting fen-
turo on the program was littlo U
year-old Onn Simpson, deaf, dumb and
blind, who with be teacher, Miss
Sophia Alcorn, showed what a person
could do even though badly handicap
ped. It Is probablo that the child is
even more rcmiirkable than the noted
Helen Keller as sho can read the voice
with her ltnndB from the mouth
throat or bock ot tho neck, simply by
placing her hands on one tho places
nnod feeling tho vibration. The child
has been attending school at Danville
and as her mother Is very poor con
tributions were asked for to support
her during tho summer while there
Is no school. In a very few minutes
almoBt ono hundred dollars was raised
Tho next and lnBt big featuro of the
afternoon was tho big blrthdny party
Tho President, Mrs. Bartlott, had been
so thoughtful to havo an Immense
cake, Iced to represent whlto roses
and tho green leaves, tho Federation
colors, como nil tho way from Heno
diet's at Louisville. Late in tho after
noon tho cako was lighted with twen
ty-two candles, twenty-ono birthdays
nnd one candlo to grow on. Headod
by littlo Ellzabth Taylor, daughter of
Dr. and Mrs. A. O. Taylor of this city,
ten little boys, two In a row, brought
tho cake into tho room amid the sing
ing of "Onward Old Kentucky," a song
presented as a birthday gift to the
Kentucky Federation of Women's
Clubs by Miss Ada May Cromwell
Over 1200 was given to carry on the
club work. Tho Goncral Federation
has started to raise a big endowment
fund for carrying on club work. The
apportionment has been met by the
State Federation, which Is now trying
to raise $10,000 for stnte work.
After tho meeting over ono hundred
of tho ladles enjoyed tho hospitality
of some thirty automobile owners nnd
took an hour's rldo t-Migli the coun
ty.
Following a very lino musical pro
"ram In tho ovoning Mrs. William Dlx
on, presldont of the Woman's Auxll
lury of tho Kentucky Humano Society,
gave u splendid address. Illustrated
with slides, of "Humana Societies and
Their Work." Mrs. Dixon has had
over live year's experience In this
line of work and was therefore able
to give a very Interesting talk, which
was especially Interesting to the
members of the locnl humano society.
The address on "Family Ilehablllta
tlon" by MIbb Clara E. Kummcr was
also very Interesting and showed that
tho lady wns well Informed and thor
oughly conversant with her subject.
After tho Invocntton by Rev. A. F.
Stnhl and the singing of "America" the
Election Commltteo reported nt 8:45
o'clock this morning. Following arc

Splendid Abundance of 10c, 12 l-2c Ginghams
Yarn-dyed goods, such as these Ginghams, take more dyes than printed Oods, and will be difficult to
obtain with the increasing dye scaroity. Plain colors are especially scarce; but there are plenty of these
here, as well as stripes, plads, checks and madras shirting styles for men's shirts. If you realized market
conditions in ginghams, you would wonder at such a largo assortment and at such little prices.

Physicians recommend it as a CURE for some digestive troubles. It is especially adapted for slender
figures and for women who indulge in any athletic sport. $1.50, $2.00 and 2.50, according to length. Fit
tings carefully gkven. An ideal corset-girdle for summer wear.
