WASHINGTON, May 18. Adminis
tration forces in Congress lost the
first skirmish in the navtfl prepared
ness campaign today when the House
committee broke a five day deadlock
and completed the naval appropria
tion bill without approving the five
pear buildine program advocated by
President Wilson and Secretary Dan
iels As finally agreed to, the bill author
izes the construction in 1917 of five
battle cruisers, as against two dread-
naughis and two battle cruisers rec-1
onended by Secretary Daniels; forj These movements, it was said, are
scout cruisers, an increase of one! part of the re-disposition of the Mex
Fcout over the Department's program !-4can command as a result of the
ten destroyers a against fifteen rc- j Scott-Otrej,jn conference at El Paso
ommerded; twenty submarines, three
to be feet submarines compared with
five fleet and 25 coast defense sub
marines, recommended; one hospital
ship, one oil fuel ship. One gunboat
recommended was stricken out and
- the fueh-jmd hospital ships were add
ed from Secretary Daniels program
for the second year. ., .
Votes $240,000,000
The total amount carried by the bill j
. . . . . '
is $Z4U.ovu.!'iu, tne largest navai ap-:
the largest naval ap-:
propnation ever placed to congress,
While the appropriation proposed Is
if anything, an increase over he De
partment's plans, failure of the five
year program and the- fact that no
dieednaughts were provided for. make
the bill unsatisfactory ' to administra
tion officials.
Hcuse and r.aval officials are con
fident that the final bill will provide
for at least two battleships and four
battle cruisers.
Polices Enters
The deadlock in the House came
as a result of the meeting of mem
bers of the committee at which it was
decided to oppose the five year pro
gram and to seek to increase the 1917
appropriations over the figure sug
gested by the Department.
Five of the thirteen Democrats not
only opposed the continuing program
but alo were determined to rut down
the 1917 estimates and not to vote for
any battleship appropriations. They
were willing to support a four battle
cruiser program, however, and the
final compromise was effected by
Chairman Padgett with Representa-
. tive Hensley of Missouri, a leader of
'i he -so-called "Little fcavy Demo
crats. who induced the other four to
toin him in agreeing to the five bat
tleship cruiser plan. To meet this
concession Mr. Padgett was compelled
to abandon the five year program and
it wa not brought to a vote in the
committee.
Ha Vision Of Peace
He was nlso forced to accept a pro
vision authorizing the President to
ca-1 a conference of weld powers at
the conclusion of the European war
to dnw plans to forn an internation
t! tribunal. An appropriation of
$200,000 for this purpose is carried In
the section, which wss adopted unani
mously an.d it would authorize the
President to appoint nine citizens
distinguished as lawyers and neace
advocates to represent the United
States. The compromise building
program was carried by the solid
Ttmocf Ic vote of the committee
and against the solid Republican
membership.
