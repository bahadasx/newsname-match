IF IT WERE THE MIDWAY THE
STOCK WOULD SELL FOR
$2 A SHARE
Cal Brougher and Zeb. Kendall car
ried away with them for display in
San Francisco some choice samples
of ore taken from the Rescue Eula
mine which they visited in company
with Clyde Heller and Frederick A.
Bradshaw of the Belmont. Both gen
tlemen were enthusiastic over the
sights witnessed in the mine which
they said was not equalled by any
thing in the camp.
"If we had that showing In the
Midway the stock would be selling
for two dollars a share," is the way
Mr. Brougher expressed himself.
Zeb Kendall was equally generous
in his praise of the property, the stock
of which he said should be selling for
at least a dollar a share strictly on
the merits of the showing so far as
the mine has been developed. Zeb
was telling of how the mine appeared
from the minute he entered the ground
where the crosscut tapped the big
ledge but that is an old story to most
Tonopah readers but when he came
to the new work in the winze Zeb de
clared the sight was enough to make
a miser's soul envy the owners.
"The winze Is down 2B feet," went
on the speaker, "with three feet of
a rich ore carrying one foot of the
richest sulphides 1 ever saw on the
hanging wall."

SAM PLATT SAYS COUIITRY IS WEARY
OF WAlTiriG FOR ACTION BY 11S0II
Samuel Piatt, candidate for nomina

tion as United States senator, motor
ed over from Goldfleld last evening
and returned to attend to law busi
ness before coming; to Tonopah to
morrow for a more extended visit. He
will accompany the Elks to Ely.
Mr. Piatt, who made such a strong
run against Senator Newlanda at the
last senatorial election, has already be
gun his new campaign in dead earn
est. He will leave shortly tor the
east to attend the Republican nation
al convention. He says the Nevada
delegation is uninsiructed and that
the convention will be an open one,
wit!i the sole 'aim of choosing1 the
strongest and best man In the party
as its presidential candidate. He re
cently returned from an extended
eastern trip and thus summarizes his
conclusions as based upon his obser
vations there and his conversation
with people who are closely studying
the situation:
"It Is the concensus of opinion In
the east that Wilson will be defeated.
This will be because of his lack of
decision. He seems unwilling to take
any decided stand. Congress is un
able to determine Ins convictions and
plans. The Republicans at Washing
ton have done everything they can
in the way of setting aside their poll
cies In order to sustain the president
should he take a stand to uphold
Americanism.
"Congressman Roberts Is making
good, in Washington. He has a very
wide acquaintance and la well thought
of. He is always on tne job. Mr,
Roberts will be a candidate for re
election.
"The vacillating policy of the ad-
ministration on the question of pre- ate and a Republican house of repre
paredness seems to be meeting with sent atl ves."
