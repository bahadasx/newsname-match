Tlie regiment will move from the cam
pus up I'niversity avenue to Ilitt
street, down Hitt street to Rroadway,
then to Kighth street and back to the
campus, where the defensive and of
fensive parties will separate to take
up their respective work. Tlie de
fense. Companies F, u and II under

will he given no hint as to the loca

to find and atack the entienched
party.
The signal Corps, under Lieutenant
G. C. Itlack, will go with Ihe offensive
to aid in locating the defeuisive. One
trumpeter will accompany each com
pany to give the necessary bugle
calls for the final attack and charge.
Sullicient ammunition will he issued

to Cadet Colonel II. R. Gibson, who

the care of a color sergeant. Colonel
Gibson is planning lo award an "iron

elf in valor, cliicieiicy and headwvjrk.
This cioss will be made by the me
chanic arts department.
So far as passible Colonel Gibson
will conduct the sham battle on I'ni
versity property. He expects the final
attack to begin about 1 o'clock and to
lie over by 5 o'cIoca'.
"One thing we wish to teach the
men," said Colonel Gibson, "is to keep
their wits about them. Too often men
lose their heads when they get a load
ed gun in their hands, and the result
is a serious accident. In a battle a
man must be able to think quickly and
well."
