CUT NUMBER OF SALOONS TO
—PASS ORDINANCE OVER
MAYOR'S HEAD
17
A regular adjourned meeting of the
city council was held at the city hall'
Monday evening, all members being
present except Murphy.
Frank J. Kopacz, Mrs. M. Kerich,
Gust. Larson and Jacob Poqch tgpre
granted permits to construct cement.
A in front of their property. The:
city engineer was instructed to give,
them the proper grade for t{ie .#uks.?
Notices of the election of officers of
Hose Company No. 1, 2 and 3 and
Chemical Company No. 2, were read,
and the elections confirmed. Geo.
Emder was recommended by the fire
department for appointment as chief
fire warden and engineer, and he was
duly appointed by the council. He
announced that he had appointed P.
J. Vasaly as first assistant chief, E.
A. Loucks as second assistant and T.
O. Berg as third assistant. These ap
pointments were confirmed.
A petition for sprinkling Broadway
West from First to Second street, was
referred to the street committee for
investigation and to report at the
next meeting. Mr. Kaye stated that
he could not handle this work unless
a standpipe would be put up on the
West side. Owing to 'the cost of a
stand pipe, $50 to $75, and the fail
ure of the petitioners to come before
the original contract was let, because
of the fact that.the territory to be
sprinkled is now all that can be han
dled with the present equipment, and
'because of the proposition made by
the petitioners of paying $1 per month
each for the sprinkling service, which
would necessitate the city collecting
it each month, the council felt that
the petition could not be granted.
They expressed the opinion that if
Mr. Kaye could handle the addition
al territory without interfering with
his work on the regular district, and
without necessitating the. installation
of a stand pipe and if he would ar
range to collect for the sprinkling, the
service could probably be furnished.
No action was taken, however, except
to refer the matter to the street com
mittee.
The board of public works gave a
Teport
recommending that the side
walk on Fourth street southwest be
constructed. A resolution was passed
authorizing the construction of the
walk and referring the matter back
to the board.
An ordinance was passed cutting
down the number of saloons in this
city from eighteen to seventeen. It
went through without a dissenting
vote.
The ordinance recently passed by
the council to permit the chautauqua
to exhibit^ here without paying a li
cense,^was.. brought up, and the may
or's veto of same was read. It was
then submitted for a vote and was
unanimously passed over the mayor's
veto.
N. N. Bergheim on behalf of the
Civic league called the council's at
tention to the serious condition of
Andrew Kuffel. He stated that the
man was in the last stages of tuber
culosis and that something must be
done with him. Several small chil
dren live in the same rooms where he
is and may contract the disease if
is not removed. The matter was re
ferred to the poor committee with
power to act on the suggestion of
sending him to the Walker sanatari
um. A doctor had stated that he did
not believe that he would live long.
H. W. Venners and Chas. Sylvester
appeared before the council and asked
for an appropriation for the Fourth
of July celebration, or that the city
hire a band. It was decided to ap
propriate $100.
Three bills were allowed, one to
Mrs. S. Zimmerman in the sum of
$5.04, for washing towels, one to the
Little Falls Milling company, $12.60,
for feed for the park animals and one
to Wm. Hang, chief of police, for $4,
for fares for poor.
Chief Fire Warden Geo. Emder ask
ed for an increase in the firemen's
pay. He gave figures to show that
the expense of the fire department has
been greatly reduced since the truck
was installed. From June, 1913, to
June, 1914, the city paid out $535 for
19 fires. During the same length of
time the following year it paid out
$382.25 for 14 fires, whereas from
June, 1915, to .June, 1916, since the
truck has been in service, the total
expenditures thus far have been only
$185.75, for the same number of fires
as last year, or less than one-half of
what they were the previous vear. The
old salary schedule of the firemen was
50 cents for the first hour and 25
cents per hour for each following
hour. Mr. Emder asked that the pay
be increased to 50 cents for the first
three hours and 25 cents per hour for
each hour thereafter. The council
passed a resolution to this effect
unanimously.
Mr. Emder also called the council's
attention to the poor condition of the
floor the city hall, where the truck
is kept. He pointed out that the old
cjhemical engine hadf been sold for
$225 and the hose cart for $30 and
asked the council to use this money
in putting in a new concrete floor.
The council favored this and the city
clerk was instructed to re-advertise
for bids for the work. Bids were re
ceived some time ago but were consid
ered too high and were rejected.
The report of Engineer Cooper, who
was here Thursday of last week to
make an examination of the new
Franciscan hospital in regard to the
installation of a motor to operate the
elevator, was read. The report is pub
lished in another column. It was or
dered filed with the city clerk.
B. F. Case of St. Paul, well known
here, had his shoulder injured Thurs
day evening of last week near Be
midji when the ear in which he and
several other men were riding, turned
turtle. The other! men escaped in*
jury.

BOARD, AT RECENT MEETING,
DISCUSSES VARIOUS NEEDED
IMPROVEMENTS
Matters relative to the needs of the
local public library were the subject
of discussion at a meeting of the
board, held Monday evening, at the
rary parlors. Those present were
S. C. Vasaly, presi4ent, Miss Sadie
Fuller, secretary, Mrs. C. A. Weyer
haeuser, Mrs. Ji B.*Holst, E. J. Richie
.and Mrs. Jenny 14nd- Blapefeard, li
.je. ?&.'•]
Several bills- were* allowed* includ
ing a bill for coal and-.one for the
new furnace at the library, amount
ing to $224.50.
That the library building and the
grounds should be a model to pattern
aftir the same as the public schools
anc£ grounds and the administrative
buildings, has always been the belief
of the board members, and to this
end, they have always sought to keep
thet appearance of the building and
grounds at their very best and their
latest step in this direction is to try
to get new awnings for the building
an4 to have the old fence removed
ana to use the appropriation for a
new 'fence to construct a boulevard
along the outside of the walk instead
and- thereby greatly add to the beau
ty of the premises. In the past the
board has tried to keep the grounds
and boulevards in shape but their ef
forts have been almost fruitless ow
ing -to the practice by some people of
using them as thoroughfares.
In line with the aim to improve the
library building, and also to save
money, the board has concluded that
a different way of handling the coal
should be arranged. As things now
are only about one-half of the amount
of fuel required for the winter can be
purchased at a time, owing to the in
adequate size of the coal bin. It has
been suggested that an outside under
ground coal bin large enough to han
dle at least a carload of coal, be con
structed, of concrete or some such ma
terial. In this way the board could
save money in purchasing the coal
and the dust situation in the library
would be relieved.
