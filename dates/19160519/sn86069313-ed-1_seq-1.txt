REJOICE AT THE RESULT
Cheer and Weep ns Vote Is Taken
Denominational Split Since
Civil War.
Saratoga Springs, N. Y., May 16.
The unification of American Method
Ism was advanced another step to
wardconsummatlon today when by a
vote that was virtually unanimous,
the 880 delegates to the General Con-
4 ference of the Methodist Episcopal
Church adopted the report of the
Special Committee on Unification,
paving the way to an amalgamation
with the Methodist Episcopal Church
South and the Methodist Protestant
Church.
The adoption of the report, which
was the most Important and far
reaching legislation that has been
enacted by a Methodist General Con
ference in many years, was attended
by, a tremendous demonstration of
enthusiasm. The great auditorium
rang with cheers and applause as the
aged Bishop Earl Cranston, who pro
sided while the action was taken, and
Bishop E. R. Hendrix, senior member
of the Board of Bishops of the South
ern .Church, clasped hands upon the
platform and wept with emotion.
Bishops Rejoice.
"This is the supremo moment of
my life!" cried Bishop Cranston.
"A marvelous result has been ach
ieved," Bishop Hendrix said. "I pray
that the whole Methodist body
throughout the world may, more and
more, see eye to eye, and Bishop
Cranston and myself may1 live to
stand Jointly over the United General
Conference of. United Methodism In
America."
A terrific outburst of applause
quickly gave way to song as the de
legates Joined In the hymn "Praise
God From Whom All Blessings Flow,
and then took up the strains of "Blest
Be the Tie That Binds."
On the platform with Bishop Cran
ston and Bishop Hendrix was one
clergyman who attended the historic
General Conference of 1844 at New
York, the last in which the Southern
Church was represented before Meth
odism was split over the question of
slavery. He la the Rev. Dr. Thomp
son H. Landon, of Bordentown, N. J.
Today's session does not unite the
two branches of the Methodist de
nomination, but continues the nego
tiations for a reunion.
"The points of agreement are
many; tho points of disagreement are
few; Bishop Hendrix said.
It Is generally believed that the ob
stacles In the way of unification havo
been overcome and that two years
hence the General Conference of the
Methodist Church, South, will accept
tho plan for reunion which the North
ern Church hopes to bring to final
fulfillment at Its general conference
in 1920. After the unification prog
ramme, tho delegates took up for a
second time tho report of tho Episc
opacy Committee on tho number of
now bishops to be chosen.

INCOME TAX
To Pay Large Portion of Prepared
ness DHL
Washington, May 16. Taxes on
Incomes, Inheritance and war muni

tho preparedness program, Chair
man Kitchln of the House Ways and

The plan has the support, Mr,
Kit chin said, of President Wilson.
What amount will have to be rais
ed cannot be determined until the
naval and army bills are completed.
Members of the Ways and Means
Committee will begin work on thfs

ever. Other, than a decision not to
lower the present exemption limit for
incomes $3000 for unmarried and
J4000 for married men none of the
details of the tax plan have been
worked out.
Plans for Imposing stamp taxes oh
manufactured tobacco, liquors, beer,
gasoline and other articles, Mr. Kit
chln said, had been definitely aban
doned. He declared the plan ot taxa
tion decided on would affect only
those best able to pay the levy, fall

on foreign nations engaged in war.
The big preparedness revenue mea
sures will not be introduced In Cong
ress until after tho conventions. Be
tween now and that tlmo the speed
ing up campaign inaugurated re
cently, will bo continued, with a
view to disposing ot all other bus
iness by early June, If possible.
Another step toward carrying out
the program was made tpday when ft
rule on the shipping bill was Intro
duced. It would provide for five
hours' general debate on tho bill and
one hour on the rule Itself. Mr. Mc
Adoo, who Is particularly interested
In the shipping bill, urged today that
it bo brought up In tho House as
quickly as possible, and Mr. Kitchln
advised him that it would be reached
Tuesday and after tha.t all other
business save that of calendar Wed
nesday, would be set aside for It.
