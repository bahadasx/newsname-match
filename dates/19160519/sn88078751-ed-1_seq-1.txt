rescue of Jeaso Deemer, the store
keeper and a former Ohio man, and
Monroe Payne, tho negro coolc, who
wero carried across the border by
bandits when thoy raided Glenn
Springs and Boquillas, Tex., two

Sibley, who received his information
from Major George T. Langhorne.
Major Langhorno reported that he
was endeavoring to overtake tho ban
dits, who had eluded him at El Pino,
from where he sent the report and
where ho found Beemer and Payne.

ble that a successful encounter with
the bandits would bring tho expedi
tion to an end and not at all improb

would also be followed by a recall.
It was explained that tho four troops
of cavalry and the machine gun com
pany operating under Colonel Sibley
was inadequate for extended opera
tions. Deemer and Payne had been left at
El Pino by the retreating bandits,
with instructions to the residents

rescue was made. The villagers re

their friendliness to' the Americans
when they entered the town.

DEATH OF
ONLY FORTY-FOUR
SEATS INVOLVED
National Committee Will Have But
Few Contests to Pass Upon.
SESSiOilS BEGIN JUNE FIRST
All Will Be In Readiness For the Re
publican National Convention Be
fore the End of the Month Elabor.
ate Arrangements Msie For Care
and Reception of Delegates and Vis
itors Secretary Reynolds' Task.
Chicago, May 18. With Secretary
James B. Reynolds and his official
staff working out tho details and a
large force of mechanics doing the
Physical work of transforming the
Coliseum into a convention hall, the
plans for the Republican national
meet June 7 are rapidly taking form
and all will be In readiness before the
end of the month. Arrangements for
the care and reception of delegates
and visitors are more elaborate than
ever before, according to Sergeant-at-Arms
William F. Stone.
Never before in the history of po
litical conventions have so many ap
plications been made for admission
tickets, and making provisions for
those who would witness the stirring
scenes incident to the selecting of the
Republican nominee for president is
proving the greatest task Secretary
Reynolds has ever undertaken.
There will be between 9,000 and
10,000 tickets given out.
When the national committee be
gins sessions June 1 to consider con
tested seats and other routine mat
ters there will be a marked contrast
from the famous meeting of four
years ago. when several hundred
seats were In dispute. This year only
forty-four are involved, including the
entire delegations from Georgia and
Louisiana. Instead of the decision of
the national committee In the con
tests having a direct bearing on the
selection of the nomine3 this year,
more than a majority of t'ne delegates
will have been elected at primaries.
The national committee will also
be called upon at its meeting to de
cide whether "double" delegations
from a few states snail be given seats
on the floor. In these cases twice the
accredited number of delegates-at-large
have been selected with a half
vote each. The committee has not
provided for seating double delega
tions. British Monitor Lost.

Debate Precedes Final Action.
Washington, May 18. Without e

bate, agreed to the conference report

olutionists, attacks upon the adminis
tration's Mexican policy, renewed as
saults upon the national guard as a

of the provision for a government
nitrate manufacturing plant
Senator Fall asserted that General
Pershing, with the 14,000 troop3 at his
command, could march on to Mexico'
City, taking every town with Utile
trouble. If he were unhampered by or
ders from Washington, and that 9f
per cent of the Mexican people would
welcome such action. He also de
clared that representatives of General
Carranza were negotiating with for
eign governments against the United

Senator Borah of Idaho, renewing
his attack on the national guard as a

tions since the European war begat..

mer blaming the house for not accept
ing a larger regular army bill pro
