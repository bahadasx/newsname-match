caps and gowns, adding dignity to
the occasion. There was a large
audience present. The sermon was
able, eloquent and inspiring and
it was good not only for the
class but everyone who heard it
The, class play given at the
opera house Tuesday night brought
out a capacity house and a record
breaker in the way of paid ad
missions, the receipts being $75.00.

there' were majors, colonels,
generals, lieutenants, scouts, spys,
orderlies, the negro seivant, all in
costumes of their times, the scene
being the home of major's widow
and her family, with the usual love
story. The cast played their parts
well, -even to the point of display
ing marked dramatic talent.
The graduating exercises were
held at the opera house Wednesday
evening before as large an audience
as could be accommodated, many
being present from neighboring
towns. The program as given in
this column last week was carried

characteristic of the speaker. It
was full of patriotism, solid advice,
preached citizenship of the highest
type and love of home, country
and active life, and if followed by
the graduates it will be an inspira
tion and guide through the life
upon which they are just entering.
