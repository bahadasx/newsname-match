pleted the naval appropriation? bill]

agreed en, the bill authorizes thc
construction in 1917 of fivo battle I
cruisers against two dreadnaughts |
and two (battle cruisers recommend
ed hy Daniels; four scout cruisers,
increase of one over tho depart
ment's plan; ten destroyers, as
flgr-Jneb fifteen recommended; twenty
