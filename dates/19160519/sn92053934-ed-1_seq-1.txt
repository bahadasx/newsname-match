BARING OF GIGANTIC WIRE
TAPPING PLOT IS PROMISED
BY NEW YORK POLICE HEAD
Commissioner Woods Eager
to Tell Secrets in Muni
tions Conspiracy.
NATION IS INVOLVED
Executive Hints That In
trigue Affects the Ameri
can Government.
Washington. May 19.-Repre-sentathe
Loft of ew Vork in
troduced a resolution for inves
ti.itidi hj a house committee of
hie members, of tapping of wires
in Ncm ork today by city au
thorities. Now Vork, May 19. Police Com
missioner Arthur Woods is ready and
apparently eager today to tell the
slate executive committee which has
lifguu an inquiry into police tapping
of telephone wires why the police
listened on the wire lo the offices of
the law firm of Seymour and Seymour,
tate Senator George F. Thompson,
chairman of the committee, promised
Mr. Woods he should have an oppor
tunity to disclose the facts in justifi
cation of the action of the police.
After a conference in which Sena
tor Thompson, the police commission
er, the district attorney and Mayor
Mitchel took part. District Attorney
Swan gave out the information that
the wire in question was tapped be
cause J. P. .Morgan and company had
complained that confidential cable
grams from the French government to
that firm regarding the buying of war
material had been stolen from the
firm's offices and sold to munition
manufacturers hi this country. -Noymonrs
Not in Hot.
The district attorney was informed
that, copies of the French cablegrams
had been received by men who had
desk room in the offices of Seymour
and Seymour, but. that this firm had
nothing to do with the matter. These
cablegrams, the district attorney said,
gave directions as to the war muni
tions to be purchased for France and
the prices to be paid for them.
.Nation Is Imolved!
Urfore testifying today, the police
commissioner said the theft of the in
formation from the Morgan offices was
only one reason why the police tap
ped the wire. "There was another
reason which I am not at liberty to
tell ber-ause it has to do with most im
portant matters affecting the national
government," said Mr. Woods.
It was reported that the police had
been informed that a foreign agent
posing as the representative of the
Russian government had purchased
war munitions, ostensibly for the en
terite allies and had smuggled them
into Mexico.
.Mayor Makes Accusation.
Mayor Mitchcl in a statement is
sued from his office today accused
Senator George F. Thompson, chair
nian of the executive committee which
!:a.i ber-n investigating wire tapping
an i vines of t he- police "of treachery
to the l'nitcd States" because of his
attempt to investigate the tapping of
the telephones of the munitions deal
ing firm of Seymour and Seymour.
This statement was issued after
Chairman Thompson had announced
that, the inquiry into the wire tap
ping would be continued at today's
session although in executive session.
Thompson told Corporation Counsel
lainar Hardy, representing Mayor
Mitchel, that "there is not now and
never was a question of international
interest involved in the case." This
was after 1,'ardy had protested against
furthi r inquiry into the Seymour case
on the ground that national interests
were at stake if publicity was given
to the 'Hkf.
County Not Connected?
Senator Thompson prior to this had
said there was not evidence that fed
eral authorities were connected with
the wire tapping, asserting it was
done l,y the Hums detective agency
r( (,rev,.r,ting J. P. Morgan and com
pany, with whom Seymour and Sey
mour had denlings in regard to a mu
nition ontrat.
"I insist." said Hardy to the chair
man, "that there is national interest
involved and 1 defy you to show to the
contrary."
"1 don't have to prove it and I
won't," replied Chairman Thompson.
"This committee is prepared to go on
Wilii its investigation and I don't
think ;i proper that there should come
from any source the imputation that
the investigation is interfering with
Questions involving the national gov
en.mer,!. It is a funny thing that no
government official is in a position
to know- anything of the alleged gov
ernment plot or knew of it except to
say they heard it through the news
papers." Sunday Faces Operation.

in privacy before he went to a local
opera house to deliver an address on
"Americanism and Preparedness for
Peace."
This afternoon Colonel Roosevelt

BIRRELL APPEARS
FOR REBEL PROBE
London, May 19. Augustine Birrell,
who resigned as chief secretary for
Ireland after the Sinn-Fein revolu
tion, appeared today as a vitness be
fore the royal commission which is
conducting an inquiry into the Irish
rebellion. The presence of the chief
I secretary aroused keen interest in
jview of the dramatic testimony given
by Sir Matthew. Nathan, former un-
der-seeretary for Ireland at yester
day's hearing. Sir Matthew testified
that the government had had advance
information regarding the German
plans for aiding the Irish rebels and
Mr. Birrell was expected to give more
details on this point.
At the outset of the hearing Mr. Bir
rell stated that he had read Sir Mat
thew's statement and that he did not
know that there were any additions or
modifications he wished to make. He
then read a statement which he had
prepared and which he described as
dealing in a general manner with Sinn
Feinism.

Lynch? s Fate
Is Mystery;
Slated to Die
New Tork, May 19. The fate of Jer
emiah C. Lynch, an American citizen,
who was to have been shot at day
break in Dublin, is believed to be
screened by strict censorship. No
word regarding the man who had been
convicted of complicity in the Irish
rebellion had como over the cables up
to 9 o'clock this morning. President
Wilson maxie an llth-hour plea for a
stay of execution just before midnight
last night in Washington. Owing to
the difference in time Lynch was to
have faced the firing squad about
three hours after Wilson had direct
ed that a cable be sent to London ask
ing that the execution be deferred un
til the American government could
make an investigation into the case.
It is not known here whether Pres
ident Wilson's plea reached the Eng
lish authorities in time to save Lynch
from being executed.
Washington, May 19. A report on
the trial of Jeremiah C. Lynch, from
the American consul at Dublin dated
yesterday was received at the state
department today from Ambassador
Page at Ixindon. It said Lynch was
tried yesterday by a field court mar
tial. An apparent omission in the coded
message made its interpretation un
certain to state department officials.
It was suggested, however, that Lynch
was to have been either sentenced or
executed at daybreak today.
Secretary Lansing's message inter
vening in Lyneh's behalf apparently
had not been received by Ambassador
Page when he forwarded his report.
GERMANY CLOSES.

Washington. May 19. German',
considering the, submarine contra

has determined to make no response
to the last American note upon the
subject. Information to this effect is
contained in confidential advices re
ceived here from Berlin.
It was indicated at the state de
partment when the note was sent that
the United States did not feel a reply
was necessary and that should one not
be forthcoming from this government
it would make no material difference.
With the apparent end of the sub
marine crisis and Germany's admoni

feel that the only remaining cause of
friction is the case of Wolfe von Igel,
secretary to the recalled German mili
tary attache, arrested in New York in
connection with a plot to blow up the
Welland canal.
Count von Bernstorff has asked for
the return of papers taken from Von
Igel but the request so far has been

French Admit Gain by Ger
mans in Terrific Assault
on Hill 287.
FIGHTING IS VIOLENT
Great Battle on the Western
Front Is Resumed With
Added Intensity.
Berlin, May 19 (via London,
3:05 p. iu.) French trenches on
both sides of the Haucourt-Esnes
high road, on the Verdun front,
west of the Meuse, have been cap
tured by the Germans, the war of
fice announced today. N inc French
officers and 120 men were taken
prisoner.
The announcement says the
captnred French positions extend
to the neighborhood of the south
ern corner of Ducks wood.
Paris, May 19, (12:01 p. m.) Vio
lent fighting on a large scale was re
sumed on the Verdun front last night.
Two fresh divisions of German troops
attacked French positions at Avocourt
wood and Hill 304 west of the Meuse.
The war office announces the attacks
in the main were unsuccessful, al
though the Germans obtained a footing
in a small post south of Hill 287,
which lies just to the east of Avocourt
wood.
The Germans attempted to recap
ture the small fort on the northeast
slope of Hill 304 which the French
took on the preceding day but their
effort failed.
Infantry fighting was confined for
the most part to the sector west of the
Meuse. Last of the river and in the
Woevre, the artillery was active. The
official statement says that the troops
employed by the Germans in their at
tacks had recently been sent to the
Verdun front.
Sub-Lieutenant Navarre, one of the
best known French aviators, who re
cently engaged in a fight with five Ger
man aeroplanes, brought down his
tenth machine in an aerial combat at
Dolante in the Argonne.
French YVar Report,
The text of the statement follows:
"In the western part of the Argonne
region the enemy has endeavored to
prevent a small salient of our line near
S-t. Hubert. Our curtain of fire checked
the Germans and they were thrown
back into their trenches.
"On the left bank of the Meuse yes
terday German forces renewed violent
attacks near Avocourt wood and Hill
;04. The enemy found it impossible
to dislodge us, except at a small work
south of Hill 2S7. Several endeavors
to continue their progress at this point
were definitely checked by the French
fire.
"On the right bank of the Meuse and
in the Woevre district there was mod
erate artillery activity.
"A German aeroplane was brought
down yesterday by one of our pilots
near St Menehould; the enemy avia
tors were taken prisoner. Sub-Lieutenant
Navarre has brought down his
10th German aeroplane near Dolante,
in the Argonne."
Austro War Report.
Berlin, May 19, (by wireless to Say
ville.) Austrian troops are continu
ing to advance at points on the Italian
front, the official statement of May 18
says, although the Italians are under
taking vigorous counter strokes. The
Austrians crossed the Luan valley and
captured Costabella.
The text of the official Austrian re
port follows:
"Italian front: In the costal region
and on the Carpathian sector, artillery
operations were impeded by fog.
Southeast of Monfalcone the Italians
attempted to recapture positions near
Bagni which they lost recently but
thev were repulsed.
"In the Col Di Lana district repeated
hostile attacks were made without
success. In the southern Tyrol, Aus-
I tro-Hungarian troops attacked and
i captured the frontier ride of Maggio
between the Astico and Lrf-no Valley,
crossed Luan Valley southeast of Pi
azza and took Costabella. They re
pulsed several hostile attacks south
of Moschere on the Segnatorta.
"We raptured yesterday more than
nine hundred Italians, among whom
I were 12 officers, and took 18 cannon
and machine guns.
"The official Italian reports of May
16 and 17 state that the Austro-Hun-garian
losses in these engagements
were enormous. These reports were
invented in order to diminish the im
pression made by the Italian retreat.
The losses of the enemy can be esti
mated only by those who hold the bat
tle field. The Italians are not in that
position. The Austro-Hungarians,
while appreciating at its full value the
sacrifice of every brave soldier, are
able to declare that the Austro-Hun-garian
losses have been exceedingly
small .thanks to the ability of the in-
jfantry, the powerful protection given
by the artillery and the experience in
uar of Lhu commanders."
15Mexicans
Die at Hands
of Cowboys
Field headquarters, near Xami
qnipa, May 19, (via wireless to
( olnmbus, M.) Twenty-five
Mexican cowboys from the Hearst
ranch at Babicora broke and scat
tered a newly formed gang of
bandits near Madera, about a week
ago, killing 15, wounding one and
capturing six, according to news
reaching here today.
The band had been organized by
Atezutro Domingnez and Pedro Cas
tillo, who announced their enmity for
Americans and Carransistas. follow
ing the theft of a number of horses
from the Hearst ranch for mounts,
thev began a sort of guerilla warfare.
Employes of the ranch surprised
the bandits in camp near the ranch
Viejo. The six taken prisoner were
delivered to Carranzista authorities in
Madera.
Among the dead were Domtnguez
and Castillo, the toll bringing the
number of Villista slain up to nearly
250 since the American punitive ex
pedition was sent across the border
about nine weeks ago.
The cowboys captured 30 horses, a
number of rifles and other booty.
90 Villistas Freed 1
Columbus, N. M., May 19 Ninety
Villista prisoners, captured by Amer
ican cavalrymen in the engagement at
Ojo-Azules, Chihuahua, late in April,
have been released, according to civil
ians returning to the border today.
The prisoners were held some days
and questioned in an attempt to ob
tain information concerning the move
ments of the various scattered ban
dits and then released, it was said.
At military headquarters here the re
ports concerning the release were re
ceived with some surprise, although a
number of prisoners have been cap
tured during the campaign and six of
them have been imprisoned in the
stockade built here.
Soldiers 111 on Mexican Food.
A number of American soldiers en
camped between Colonia Dublan and
Namiquipa recently became ill after
eating food purchased from Mexicans
and as a result several of the native
were taken into custody, the arrivals
said. Military authorities have taken
steps to prevent a repetition of the
danger. Heavy traffic over the motor
truck trail from Columbus to Nami
quipa has made it almost impassable,
truck men said. In some places the
road, despite efforts of the engineer
ing corps, has become to rutted as to
make impossible a greater speed than
threa miles an hour.
Some of the truckmen reported to
the hospital upon their arrival suffer
ing from illnesses presumably caused
by the heavy jolting.
Cavalry's Value Proven.
Field Headquarters, May 11 (by mo
tor trucks to Columbus, N. M., May
19.) One phase of the Villa chase
noted by army officers has been that
the value of cavalry for scouting and
all around fighting has not at all de
creased. Notwithstanding the use of aero
planes for scouting the cavalry recon
naissance lost none of its military
value. Four sets of conditions devel
oped, under which the aeroplanes
could not scout in fog, darkness, in
rain, and in cloudy weather. The cav
alry did its most efficient scouting in
darkness, or under cover of rain
clouds. Every important fight with
bandits was accomplished under cover
of night, which made surprise attacks
possible.
Few persons, even those with the
expedition, realized that, the remark
able work of the auto trucks in main
taining the supply line was done large
ly as an auxiliary for cavalry opera
tions. The daily ration for one sol
dier averages two pounds, whereas the
daily ration for a horse is 11 pounds,
so that the trucks were carrying a
heavy proportion of their loads for
the cavalry horses.
YYent Without Rations.
For several weeks most of the cav
alry campaigned without truck ra
tions, either for man or horse, but
this work brought out another dis
tinctive value of thoroughly trained
cavalry. This was the cavalryman's
individual skill as a horseman, which
enabled the men to keep their mounts
alive and serviceable, not only on
scanty fodder, but on no feed at all.
In all their battles the cavalrymen
fought as infantry, that is dismount
ed, and with rifles or pistols. The dif
ference between them and mounted
infantry lay in the years of careful
training which enabled them to keep
the horses going under conditions so
trying that probably nine-tenths of
the animals would have perished un
der the handling of anyone except an
expert horseman.

Secretary Baker Annonnces Chicago
Scale Likely Will Be Considered
in Wage Demands.
Washington, May 19. Machinists'
wage scales in Chicago, and possibly
other large cities, Secretary Baker in
dicated today, probably will be con
sidered in increasing the pay of spe
cially skilled employes of the Rock Is
land arsenal.
Secretary Baker said today he was
most optimistic over prospects of a
wage adjustment satisfactory to the
workmen. Consideration of the in
creases asked practically has been
reopened.
The foregoing Associated Press dis
patch indicates that the men at the
arsenal who have been threatening to
strike unless their wage demands were
met have gained their point, which is
that the government, in passing on
the merits of their case, should con
sider the Chicago scale and not con
fine it to the scale paid in the shops
in the cities located near the arsenal.

PROVIDES A BIG PLANT
Step Towards Government
Manufacture is Seen in
Action at Washington.
CBy Associated Press).
Washington, D. C, May
19. Plans for facilities at
Rock Island arsenal for man
ufacturing field artillery am
munition at a total cost not
to exceed $1,250,000, are au
thorized in the sundry civil
bill reported today by the
house appropriations com
mittee. A half million dollar nlant cmninr.
ing 1,000 men will be added to Rock
Island arsenal if the bill is reported!
out of the house and receives the in-t
dorsement of the senate, ColoneL;
George W. Burr, commandant at the
arsenal, said today.
Ihe new plant will be a big step to-
wards government manufacture and
preparedness. Not only will munitions
be manufactured, but they will also be
assembled at the plant.
"The appropriation means the erec
tion of a plant for the manufacture and
assembling of field artillery ammuni
tion," Colonel Burr saiL "It will in
clude additions to the waterpower
plant to give us more power. The
shop will be very modern. It will be
perhaps twice the size of one of th
present shops and will cost 1500,000.
The remainder of the appropriation,
will be used in equipping the plant.
"The new shop will be located west
of the present shops on the main ave
nue. The shops we have now are built
on a quadrangle, but represent a style
of architecture long since out of date.
The plan is to start a new quadrangle
of modern shops west of the present
ones.
"As far as the waterpower is con
cerned, we would have to make big
changes in the plant. The machines
are old, having been in use for IS
years. We would have to replace the
wheels and the generators with new
devices and would add to the power of
the plant.
"It is a big step towards prepared
ness. There are a hundred plants in
this vicinity that are capable of mak
ing parts of field munitions. My idea
is to have a part of the plant as a place
for the assembling of these parts.
Plants in Moline, Rock Island, Chi
cago, St. Louis and numerous other
cities in time of war could make thes
parts just as some of them are making
them now.
"This is a special appropriation for
this plant. It is not the regular ap
propriation under which we pay our
operating expenses for the arsenal in
general.
"In my opinion the bill has an ex
ceptional chance of being passed, if
reported out of the house. I think the
senate will act favorably upon it. I
have known for some time that the
appropriation was to be incorporated
in the bill and its promoters have ex
pressed their belief that it has every
chance of being favorably acted upon.
It will mean a big addition to the arse
nal." FORD'S PARTY AIDS
