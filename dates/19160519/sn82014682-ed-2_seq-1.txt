Air-Kilauea, Too, Makes Grand
- Display Vith Living Fires
i - -
Mokuaweoweo, the crater which tops Mauna Load's lofty peak
on the island of Hawaii, is active. , ;
This news, startling to volcanologists as well, as to the laymen
who see the volcanoes as spectacles only, was flashed by wireless
to the Star-Bulletin this morning from Hilo. , At almost the samg
time came another message to this paper from a party of visitors at
the Volcano House, saying that the great pit of Kilauea is giving a
"wonderful display of buring lava fields and high-spurting fire
fountains. ' "'
The first message, the middle of
this morning, came from a party
who visited the volcano last night,
consisting of John K. Bulger, U.
S. supervising inspector of steam
vessels for the first district, here
from San Francisco for a , few
days; Thomas J. Heeney, local U.
8. inspector of boilers; William
McKay of Hilo and William
Thompson of Honolulu. This mes
sage said:
Kilauea giving magnificent
-display. Fountains high. "Twenty
five acres of fire last night' .
Only a few moments thereafter
came a wireless from the Star
Bulletin's Hilo correspondent
which said:
"lokuaweowco broke out at Tj
'o'clock this morning.- Steamand
smoke shooting 20,000 feet up into
the air. Magnificent sights Lava
flow down Naalehu side of moun
tain, is report; Steam and smoke

. " Mauna Loa broke out this
morning at 7:15. The flow is ap
parently on the Kau-Kona side,

Volcano House." ' '
Mokuaweoweo is active only at
comparatively long intervals. Ma

i. . I.j
the summit of the mountain " Ac

LAVA FLOW
' "Kabuku ranch reports lava flows
In the kau districts toward the town
of Naalehu." , The following report
was received by U,W. de Vis-Norton
this afternoon from George H. Vicars
of Hilo. Upon receipt of this informa
tion the Hawaii Publicity Commission
and Hawaii Promotion Committee be
gan working on a plan for a big ex
cursion to Hawaii tomorrow.
A big placard has been placed in
the window of the office of the Ha
waii Promotion 'Committee,; announc
ing the lava flow, and It is expected
that a large number will -visit this
section, going by the steamer Mauna
Kea tomorrow. At the time of the
last lava flow a large number took the
trip, carrying with them tenta and
other articles of camp life.
The eruption of Mauna Loa carries
out the prediction made by ,T. A. Jag
gar and Frank Perret-two noted vol
canologists, who made the statement
that the eruption would occur some
time in the spring, says the Promotion
Committee. This prediction was made
one year ago.
