were the topic of conversation, and
also the subject of a number of ad­
dresses by the speakers.
Hinckley on Roads
Chief Engineer Hinckley* of the
Chalmers company, when called on,
stated that North Dakota did not have
any-'corner on bad rpa.#, as the roads
traVersed by the' pathfinders in Min­
nesota were much worse. Mr: Hinck­
ley however, is having his first ex­
perience on gumbo roads. He thinks,
however, that North Dakota roads
cart Easily be placed in first class con­
dition, and Says the scheme of laying
out' highways in this state, so thai
they iterallel each other, is an excel­
lent one.
Mr.-Wiiiririgton discussed the plans
for the tour this summer, and assur­
ed those present that the tourists
would stop in Bismarck, provided the
road between this city and McKenzie
is fixed atad repaired before that time.
On behalf of the County Commission,
Secretary Price of the Commercial
club assured Mr. Harrington the roads
In Burleigh county would be placed
in first class condition Ions before
that time.

resentative of the National Parks
Highway association, attended the
gathering and made the principal ad­
dress of the evening. Mr. Keniston
is familiar with all tlie transcontin­
ental highways and stated last even-'
ing that in his mind the "Red Trail'
will eventually become the most pop­
ular route of all.
Mr. Keniston went into a detailed
description of the proper road con­
struction for this state, as well as its
cost, and gave the pathfinders same
valuable pointers on the roads that
are ahead of them. He assured them
however that the worst of their trials
are over and that the roads west of
this city are in good condition.
J. L. Hjort, candidate for Secretary

Official Documents From J. P.
Morgan & Co.

wire of the law firm of Seymour &
Seymour was "tapped" by the police,
District Attorney Swann stated to­
night, not that they were searching
for a clue that might result in inter­
national complications, as Mayor
Mitchell and Police Commissioner
Woods had intimated earlier in the
day, but because .T. P. Morgan & Co.
had complained that official docu­
ments were being stolen from their
offices.
The Morgan documents were given,
Mr.' Swann declared, to someone who
had rooms in the Seymour & Seymour
offices, and who realized large sums
by selling the information they con­
tained to American munition manu­
facturers. He made it clear that Sey­
mour & Seymour had no connection

of the local hospitals for twelve days
and every effort was made to save
