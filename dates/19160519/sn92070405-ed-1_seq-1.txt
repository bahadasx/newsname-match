"KING OF TIMBUCTOO-
A BIG SUCCESS
Written for the Liberal by "N"
The prophecy of the Western
Liberal of May 4, a 'Roaring Mu
sical farce," was fulfilled in the
most successful manner imagina
ble..
i. crowded house awaited the
rising of the curtain on the "main
street of Timbuctoo and with
microscopes ready, the plot was
soon discovered, viz: "The search
for a happy woman," and if none
were found, the result was the los
ing of the throne and the behead
ing of the king the part so ably
taken by our well known amateur
actor, Samnue Gass.
The king was very well attended
by Ginger, Lord High Chamber
maid to his majesty. When we tell
you said Ginger was played by Matt
Mansfield, we can almost say nuii
said," for it would have taken an
Al professional to beat him.
Prof. Conic Sections, of the Yale
faculty, Tohn Crowell, and his
wife, Rita Conic Sections, a decid
edly new woman, played by Miss
Elizabeth Reynolds, were a com
plete success
Piper Heidseick, Mr. Dick
Young, the genial inn keeper, was
perfectly at home both as a land
lord and a good natured Irishman.
Mr. Tom Lister showed his abil
ity as a showman in the character
of William Slick. In this he was
assisted by Miss Lucille Veatch,
who assumed the part of Stella
Foxey, his wife. Her knack of
mind reading was wonderful.
Mr. Faris E ush. as General Nas
ticus proved that he could take
command of an army most any
time, as his soldiers were well
trained and obeyed orders without
the slightest hesitation. As Charlie
Chaplin, Mr. Bush was a scream
from start to finish.
The heir to the throne, Prince
De Kaciak, Mr. Cross, decided he
could both occupy the throne and
find the happy woman, bo very
successful was he that he was
crowned King, and found the hap
py woman, Marie Fleurdelis, an
American heiress, who was in real
ity, Miss Marie Marshall In their
usually pleasing manner they
played their parts very successful
ly. Had a real Princess been trans
ported from the king's palace in
darkest Africa, she would not have
been appreciated more than was
Mrs. Frances Sellick, ai Princess
Nikita.
Mrs. Crowell, Mrs. Reynolds, and
the Misses Rachel Robson and
Dewey McGrath, who assisted in
fhe chorus work, and the special
ties, made the play an entire sue
cess.
. The play was interspersed with
.solos, duets and drills. The solos
and duets showed the very careful
training Miss Garrett had given
per pupils.
Of the drills we mention the Flo
ral drill, the Spanish dance, the
Doll drill and the Suffragette drill.
They were given with enthusiasm
and with a thorough knowledge of
musical rhythm.
t A number of the special songs
were composed by the talented
leader of the Harmony Club, Miss
JSarrett. To her untiring efforts,
fia a leader, the willingness to make
it a success, and the harmony of
Jhe harmony club, combined with
the beautiful stage setting, which
vas the entire work of Max Mo
huff, an artist who has lately come
among us, we will ring the curtain
down over the closing scene, think
ing, "they lived happily ever af-
ier." "N."
Miss Garrett's two solos be
tween acts were of her usual
high quality and were more than
appreciated by the audience.
Miss Marie Marshall's rendition
of "When I. Was A Dreamer"
and "I Love You" captivated the
crowd. Miss Marshall has an
excellent voice and is always sure
of a hearty reception before a
local audience.
Miss Veatih and John Crowell
made a big hit with Miss Gar
rett's composition "School Days."
Matt Mansfield did remarkably
well in his solo parts. Sam Gass
was enthusiastically received in
his solo "Tonight Will Never
Come Again."

Garrett Will Give a Music
