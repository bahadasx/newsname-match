CIRCUIT COURT CASES
The Docket is Fairly Cleared -Only
Two Big Cases
Many Divorces
Judge Fred Lamb has pushed
proceedings along as well as he
could under all the circumstances
and will clear the docket this
week. There have been but two
cases which attracted attention
to any extent, the prosecution of
Bob Fuller for complicity in hen
roost robbery and the damage
suit brot against J. H. Smith for
injury sustained by Mrs. H. Ster
ner, bringing out a large number
of interested spectators from the
country as well as town.
Divorce cases predominated.

the state, taking much of the
time of the court.

Success.
The County Sunday School
Convention held at Sumner last
week was a great success and
that there will be much awaken
ed interest in the good institu
tion, there is much hope.
We have no sufficient space for
the proceedings in full, nor can
we spare sufficient to give the
long resolutions, all good and
very appropriate except the last
two which had to branch off into
politics and strain a point for
endorsement, but signifying that
a watchful eye would be kept on
tne one endorsed, indicating, as
we infer, that breath perfumers
or a slight wabble on state oc

County Court
The court met Monday to ap
portion the bridges it will be able sometimes
to build this summer, the num
ber perhaps not exceeding ten.
While thirty-five were adver
tised for bidders, there will be
only the number mentioned con
structed on account of funds to
pay for them. The court will
select the sites for those it will
contract for in the near future.
The building of the dump road
across the bottom west of town
was let to Charles Parker and
there had been left a large foot:
bath tub which leaned against
the wall. After one mighty flop,
quiet dominated the house and
this part of town. For several
days the mew of a cat could be
heard somewhere about the
premises and diligent search
was instituted. During a search,
not a sound; immediately after,
in the composing
room, then in the omce, then in
the coal bunker at the rear, then
up the stairway, cat-cries could
be heard. The young ladies in
the composing room, the fore
man and we might add, ye edi-

no concern about the disappear

Rev. Sam Watson
The one time, years ago, pas
tor of the Presbyterian Church
at this city. Rev. Sam Watson
was here Thursday and Friday
f last week, his visit being prin
cipally to conduct the funeral
services of his old friend and
highly cherished member of his
burch, Mrs. A. G. Arrington.
There never was a more highly
esteemed minister among us
ban was the honest, unassum
ing, educated and all round high-
y intellectual and companion
able Sam Watson, and the esti
mation of the distinguished di
vine was not alone among church
members, but the rankest out
sider reverenced the truly chris
tian gentlemen.
Rev. Watson looks and is.
what he has always been, no
change except a slight indica
tion of advancing years being
perceptible. He visited many
of his old members and friends
during his short stay, and deeply
regretted that duties at his home
called him back so soon.
Women In Danger
Mrs John Goll and Mrs. Lee
Cuddy were on their way to
town Tuesday in a one horse
buggy and crossing the bottom
near the bridge west of the
court house, water was over the
dump and there are several deep
holes in the roadway and into
one of these the horse hauled
the buggy after plunging thru
breaking the single tree and
nearly getting out of the shafts
The water was nearly in the
bed of the buggy and the cur
rent such as to nearly force the
vehicle over, in which case the
two women would have been
swept over the wire fence and
perhaps not have escaped drown
ing for there was a sea of water
south of the road.
There were two men at the
bridge rescuing a horse which
had toppled over in the water
and they could afford no relie
to the women, but Abraham Voss
came along in a few minutes and
