Base Ball in
Beach Sunday
Local Ball Tossers Will Mix
With OUie on Local
Diamond.
The opening game of the sea
son will be played in Beach Sun
day May 21st between Ollie and
the local aggregation. The rainy
•weather of the past week caused
the Ollie game whicft was sche
duled for last Sunday to be post
poned.
The locals are fast rounding in
to shape and by the first of June
•will be going at top notch speed.
Several good games are on the
schedule including such teams as
Dickinson, Glendive, Terry. Miles
City, Ollie and Carlyle. Golva has
organized but as yet has no team
in the field. It is understood that
an effort is under way whereby
the Beach and Golva teams are to
l)e consolidated. If such an agree
ment could be brought about it
would add considerable strength
to the situation and would put
Beach and Golva on the baseball
map in great shape, as each team
lias quite a few fast men that
•would form a combination that
would be hard to eat.
As to the schedule to date it is
as follows: May 21sl. Ollie here,
May 28. Dickinson here, May 31,
(Decoration Day) Beach at Dick
inson, June4, Ollie there, June 11,
Glenidve here, June 17, (Elks Fes
tival) Beach at Dickinson, June
24 and 25, Dickinson here. Sev
eral games with south branch
towns are to be played on dates
between the above mentioned, but
have not been decided yet.
With the organization Beach al
ready has, considerable interest
should be manifested the coming
season. Turn out to the game
Sunday and show the boys that
you are with them win or lose.
Turn out and demonstrate some
of that rooting ability Beach has
leen famous for in the past. Noise
from the sidelines has worf many
a ball game. You want Beach to
win so come out and cheer. Ollie
will be here strong so don't be
outdone in matter of numbers at
least.
A slow, cold rain which started
to J'y'l Saturday and continued at
ihicr 'als until Tuesday af'.ernoon,
when the clouds showed a dispo
sition to clear away and let the
much needed rays of the sua fil
terter through, greatly delayed
ed farming operations, already
much delayed because of the
backward season. However, the
rain falling as it did following
the high winds of last week, which
depleted the soil of much mois
ture, have done considerable
good, but a continuance of the in
clement weather will result in
grave danger to crop conditions.
Warm, sunny weather is greatly
needed at the present time. From
other sections of the state come
reports that the high wind of last
week have made necessary re
seeding of large areas. In this
respect, the Golden Valley so far
as we have been able to learn was
immune, though in a very few in
stances the dust drifted and cov
ered patches to a depth of several
inches. In the aggregate the dam
age from this source was small.
With a return of working weath
er, many# tractor farmers are
running night shifts in their race
against time, and others are us
ing every available hour of day
light in an eleventh hour effort to
get their land seeded. A more
optimstic condition prevails over
last week.

of the Slope County News* npw or

the latter part of the week.
'DAMAGED GOODS," A
WONDERFUL LESSON.
An authority said
It
:"A.
wave of im­
morality has swept over the
country. It is the subject of con
versation in the street cars, in the
office and store, and at the family
board. Such authorities as Dr.
Kelley, of Baltimore, and Dr. W.
W. Keeu, the great surgeon, of
Phildelphia, find the explanation
of this singular breakdown in
morals. First, in the incoming of
Huns and Vandals, with the low
ideals of the old world, and sec
ond, in the breakdown of morals
among our wealthy classes, with
their debauchery, their divorces
and their unending scandals that
He like a black strain across the
page of each morning paper. To
all other classes we must add the
influence of a group of degenerate
authors and worst of all, of auth
oresses. Sinclair says: 'What we
call prostitutes are not the worst,
but generally the best of the
poorer classes people of fine
physique, who cannot get their
true match in the sphere they
were born, and must, by the hol
iest of all instincts, that of truth,
seek upward by any means.' A
popular American actor had so
many wives that he now speaks
of them by number, and recently
defended American women
against an attack of a French
man by saying that 'in his exper
ience nearly all American women
made good wives.' He calls this
loose and indiscriminate epoch
'a new experiment in living.' Stan
ley found in Africa a brilliant
spider that spread itself out like
llower, and beauty-seeking in
sects, lighting upon it, found, not
honey, but fetters, pain and death.
In every American city, there is a
black quarter and above these
streets should be written Dante's
words, 'Abandon hope all ye who
enter here.' The time has fully
come for the public school teach
er, the editor, the lecturer, the
physician, the parent and teacher
to end this guilty silence and to
lift the wreath from that diseased
hag named lust that has long mas
queraded as an angel of light.
For the individual and the na
tion it is true that 'he who soweth
the wind shall reap the whirl
wind."
GRADER AT WORK
ON CITY STREETS.
With a let-up of the general
rainy conditions which have pre
vailed during the past week, Chief
of Police M. J. Moran.in his cap
actiy of street commissioner, is
busily engaged this week in get
ting the streets of the city in
shape. For this purpose, a gra
der, horses and several men under
Mr. Moran's direction are now at
work, and are accomplishing
wonders for belter streets
throughout the city. In order to
accomplish the work more quick
ly, the dryer portions of the city
streets are being attended to first,
which will give the low places,
in need of filling, a little more
time to dry for working.
Mr. Moran makes an efficient
street commissioner, as well as
chief of police, and should have
the co-operation of every proper
ty-holder in his efforts to keep
the streets in proper condition.
Mrs. John P. Berringer and
daughter, Miss Rose, autoed out
with Henry Brown to Beach last
Sunday, getting an early start and
reaching their destination before
the high wind arose. After spend
ing the day with Mrs. Berringer's
daughter, Mrs. Clifford Smith, the
party returned to Dickinsonabout
7:30 in the evening. The trip of
71 miles was made in less than
three hours, with a high wind
and over Bad Land roads at that.

were unwilling to give, owing to
the expense of operation.
One phase of the matter which
is puzzling the Beach office is the
fact lhat, though the order was
issued to send all mail to Golva,
Carlyle and Ollie by train, no
order as yet has been received
rescinding carrier service. The
star carrier serves Golva, Bur
key, Carlyle and Ollie, and unless
provision is made by the depart
ment, the Burkcy oflice will be
deprived of mail privileges. As
a result, Postmaster J. M. Baer,
in a desire to continue serving the
Burkey office without overstep
ping authority, is in a quandary,
but pending the arrival of expli
cit instructions is continuing
temporarily service to the Bur
kcy patrons from the Beach of
fice. Mr. Baer has made recom
mendations to the department
which will soon give all patrons
who are cut off from mail ser
vice under the new arrangement
definite mail deliveries in the near
future, as soon as a schedule and
the territory to be served can be
arranged.
Under the daily service sche
dule, trains hereafter will start
from the Ollie end of the branch,
arriving here at 8:45 in the morn
ing, leaving at 1:00 in the after
noon and arrived at OUie ae 2:
45.
This will be a big advantage to
people of that territory who de
sire to complete the round-trip in
one day. The daily service, also,
is an advantage which will be of
decided benefit, the old service
giving but three mails weekly.

The Beach Scrap Iron and Me

firm organized to conduct busi

where Ihe new firm is already
prepared to do business. New
buildings are being erected, and
will soon be completed.
The firm will make a specialty
of purchasing scrap metals of all
kinds, rubber articles such as
tires, rubbers, etc., and rags and

result of the increasing metal,

should be the means of many

should be a big factor in the

splendid business. So save your

WATERS BRINGS BACK
SOME BLOODED STOCK.
J. R. Waters returned this week
from Wisconsin with a car of
slock, among which were seven
horses and three cows. The cows
are as fine a bunch as were ever
brought into the Golden Valley,
one, a Brown Swiss, being espe
cially fine. Two Holsteins are
admirable animals.
Among the horses are a span
of heavy draft marcs lhat show
a lot of quality. A young stal
lion, three years old, sired by
Emperor Peter 2:251/t, son of Pet
er the Great, Ihe horse that sold
for $50,000 in January, is creating
considerable attention among lo
cal horsemen. This horse is des
tined to become the northern
chief of the Peter the Great tribe.
Two young mares are by Silver
Todd 2:17, and a sorrel gelding,
city broke in every way, is one
of the handsomest drivers the
writer has ever seen.
In chronicling the death of Sel
estine Whitmer in our last week's
issue, we made an error which
this week we hasten lo correct.
Many of the details concerning
the estimable old gentlemen's
death were secured amid the
press-day turmoil and din of the
shop ovr the phone, and through
regrelable misunderstanding,we
gave his name as Philip Dean
Whitmer instead of Selesline
Whitmer, as it should have been.
Our readers will realize the hu
manness of our error, in the sim
ilarily of the names. Mr. Whifr
mer's death occurred at the Slough
hospital in this city, instead of
at the farm, and lie was the reci
pient of every care and attention.
"Another interesting group of
Triangle features were seen at the
Knickerbocker Theatre yesterday.
The feature is a screen version

'Acquitted.' It is a powerful

thetic note, illustrating the harsh
results caused by an unfeeling
business policy, but ends happily
after much intense dramatic act
ion. It is served to bring to the
fore Wilfred Lucas and several
other Triangle favorites, and af

GAME AND FISH BOARD
HOLD MEETING AT FARGO.
J. P. Reeve, president of the
Slate Game and Fish Board, re
turned Wednesday morning from
Fargo, where he attended the two
day's regular monthly meeting
of the board Monday and Tues
day.
We are informed thai the board
created a game reserve near Man
dan consisting of six sections of
well wooded and watered land,
making a personal inspection of
the premises involved. He re
ports that the birds of Ihe state
wintered well in spite of ihe ex
tremely cold weather, and that
»t the present time a large num
ber of geese and thicks are in the
slate nesting along water courses.
The board also gave some at
tention to the question of fish dy
ing in the lakes of ihe Turtle
anountain district. It is believed
that fish died from suffocation,
by the ice freezing in a
double layer, coupled with the
heavy blankets of snow.
The beaver also gave the board
a subject for consideration, the
beaver proving troublesome in
the Mouse River district. There
is a closed season on heaver, al
though there is some sentiment
towards declaring an open sea
son because of the trouble they
are causing.
Bird life is especially evident in
this section of the state, the feath
ered harbingers of spring being
in greater number than l^as been
the case for several years.

To Fargo.
Mathew I. Thompson, alias
Malt Telin, hadiv wanted by the
postoffice authorities for the al
ed embezzlement of funds
while assistant postmaster at
Avard, Oklahoma, some time
ago, was apprehended at Sentinel
Butte last week by Sheriff S. A.
Smith and brought to this city.
U. S. Marshall S. J. Doyle arrived
from Fargo the following day and
look the prisoner to Fargo. He
left Sunday in charge of Deputy
U. S. Marshall Wattles for Okla
homa City, Okla., where he will
stand trial.
'When arrested \hy Sheriff
Smith. Thompson vigorously pro
tested his guilt, but is under
stood to have later acknowledg
ed his identity, with the asser
tion thai he had nothing to fear
and would return to Oklahoma
lo face the charges.
When arrainged before U. S.
Commissioner A. W. Cuplcr of
Fargo, however, he waived exam
ination and admitted that he was
the man wanted.
The arrest is the result of cor
respondence between Postmaster
Peterson of Sentinel Butte and
OUIohoma officials, who slated
that Thompson had been located
at Sentinel Bulte, presumably
thru letters lo Oklahoma friends.
It is understood here that he had
been indicted by the federal
grand jury in Oklahoma on a
charge of embezzling $170 of
postal and money order funds of
the office in which he was as
sistant. The description given
tallied in every particular with
Telin, as he was known in Sen
tinel Butte, and who had been
there but a short time.
Thompson, or Telin, was asso
ciated with W. W. Stackhouse, a
real estate dealer of Dickinson,

men were doing a splendid real e»
