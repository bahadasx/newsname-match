VOLUME XIV.
Elsewhere will be found the
" card of endorsement of the Som
erville bar for C. A. Stainback
as a candidate for Attorney Gen
eral for this circuit. The elec
tion in Au&st is for the balance
of the term of J. A. Tipton. Nat
Tipton is in by appointment until
the August election. Without
any disparazement to other can
didates Mr. Stainback certainly
- stands second to none. He is
recognized as a Very Able Law
yer, But few men fill the office
of attorney general with his
ability and experience. '" In too
many instances young men with
out much experience are given
the office to practice on. This is
at the expense of the administra
tion of the criminal laws. That
; Mr. Stainback is a died-in-the-wcol
democrat cannot be ques
tion. Seldom do we advocate
any man's election, but in this
instance we unhesitatingly say
the democrats should select Mr.
Stainback at the primary. This
is not a paid or solicited endorse
jnent. ' " : ' ' - '

Editor Independent. '
Yoar Readers have all heard about
. the awful war in Europe, but it is
only n faint echo of that world-conflict
that reaches the peaceful re
treats of - western Tennessee. 1 The
roaring of the death-tempest can be
faintly heard them, as the sound of
the hurricane in the tree-tops might
reach down to the violets below. But
here, at the eastern irate of the na
tion, we catch the echoes more
plainly of the conflict,' beside which
all wars of the past were bat petty
'quarrels! The' great' metropolitan
papers come out with' their dozen or
more editions every day, and in big
black lines tell ,ua the latest' tragedy
in Europe or Mexico. New York
city is the home of millions of people
of foreign birth, many of whom think
more of their native land than ours,
and who, in the case of outbreak of
war between us and the country ; of
their birth, would not for a moment
. hesitate to take up arms against us.
It requires; constant activity to keep
the plotters from carrying through
their bad work right under our noses;
the devilish work of putting bombs
on ships leaving' our port, blowing up
. munition factories, or fixing to" blow
up buildings and even canals in a
neighboring nation. We have had
out hands full here running in men
who ' had planned to blow up . the
Welland canal in Canada; I saw the
ringleader brought into onr office at
night, with his accomplices.' who. had
plotted here to do the deed in Cana
da; and since then we have bad to
deal with many like him, all trying to
,i put through some bad scheme, which,
hatched n our soil, might get us into
trouble with some other nation.' We
had to watch men trying to smuggle
, ammunition and men into Mexico, and
what this branch of Uncle Sam's
watch force has had to do since 1
came here last summer would make a
' big book. The rascals are generally
caught, but others take their place,
and; the dirty work goes on. v
New York city la the great watct
tower of the nation; , here is where
the trouble, if it pomes, will first be
. manifested. The line Of buildings on
Manhattan Island, which looms up be
fore the eye of the visitor who comes
' here the tallest and finest sky-line
in the world would be a shining
mark for the bombardment by a for
eign fleet. The Woolworth Buildinsr
V towers up nearly 800- feet; from its
top downward for 200 feet it la light
ed at night with electric 'bulbs' filled
with nitrogen gas, giving forty-mil
lion candle-power, the light of which
can be seen twenty miles at night.
X)nly think that the modern guns of
Europe, such as are now battering
' Verdun in France, can throw an JSOO
pound shell twenty-two miles; so that
: the warship, anchored out of eight of
our shores, could send those mesaen
gers of death in on us while still out
of sight and almost out of hearing;
(he first warning would be the long
howl of the enormous shell, bight feet
long and sixteen inches thick,' weigh
ing nearly a'ton and able, whan, it
explodes, to cut the entrails out of
the biggest building here. A few
thousand shells like that would lay
thia vast city in ruins, and make the
most stupendous slaughter in the his
tory of humanity. Remember, too,
that in 1894 the Japanese began their
bombardment at 3 o'clock in the
morning, and thus started the war
against Russia. And then think that
in this city alone there may be hun
dreds of thousands of men who would
instantly take the part of our foreign
foe if we were attacked! . No wonder
resident Wilson went the rounds of
the country preaching preparedness
for war, and so bitterly denounced
those Americans of divided allegiance,
who love another country' better than
our own. ' "Like a thief in the night"
thia trouble may come upon us. The
people here are aroused as I never
saw them. At the moving picture
theaters, an army Bcene, and espe
cially pictures of battle-ships under
way and soldiers marching, bring
forth loud apDlause, even though the
scene may be laid in Canada or En
gland, and the audience greets por
traits of the president and generals
with acclaim whenever they are
thrown on the screen. A caricature
of Theodore Roosevelt, representing
him as on the war-path, was loudly
applauded, and he seems destined to
play a big part in the nation's affairs
yet. Politics is largely forgotten,
however, the Republican papers gen
erally giving President Wilson gener
ous support in his European and Mex
ican policies, which are compared to
those of Abraham Lincoln in their
quiet wisdom and firmness. In his
hard task of steering our ship of
state at this stormy time, our presi
dent, whatever party he may repre
sent, is certainly entitled to our best
and undivided support.
Many of your readers remember
the civil" war of the" Bixties. The
wounds theri'made are healed, and if
a foreign foe should attack us, the
blue and the gray would be forever
welded into one rank of defense.
The South, so free from foreign pop
ulationand influence, would really be
the bulwark of the nation, although
t must be understood that many
naturalized citizens of foreign birth
would stand by us in that day of
trial, for it is here that they have
been protected and have prospered,
and have raised their children' in the
sweet, free air of a great republic, of
which they are proud. ;
For one hundred and forty years
we have stood before the world as an
independent nation; "no foe has
breathed but fell before us;" we have
never tasted defeat, and we would
almost as soon think -of the sky fall
ing as of passing under the despot
ism of a foreign ruler. ' It is painful
even to imagine having to bow the
knee and pay tribute in heavy taxa
tion to a prince of foreign blood; of
having our laws overturned and our
courts and statutes in a strange
tongue, or even be forbidden to , uee
the English language, so like the
breath of life to us; to give our sons
as army slaves to brutal despots from
another land; to have even the names
of our states, counties, rivers and
towns changed to hideous-sounding
things, and our fair daughters de
manded as "morganatic wives" of
bloated princelings from across the
s :a, no power left to protect them
Suppose, when we desired some favor,
we had to kneel for it to a fat-faced
scoundrel from Europe, and say:
"Vagyok oent megkerdezni", for "I
take the liberty to ask you!" , (This
is not Holy Roller talk, but an actual
equivalent of these English words, in
a European language I am now learn
ingnot. however, expecting to kneel
to anybody soon, other than to a
Power above that of any man.) Such
things have happened to people just
as smart and as virtuous as we, God
grant that no foreign potentate may
invade our fair land. But time, which
has brought such things to others,
will not always leave us in peace, and
we may yet have to fight to maintain
that liberty which, like water, is not
missed in full till it is gone. .
Many authorities are urging that
military science be taught to all high
school boys, under a regular army
officer, and that system is already in
rogue st Macon, Georgia, and other
SELMER. McNAIRY
places. In a tight enough pinch, we
could raise a volunteer army of sev'
eral millions of as brave men as ever
lived; but bravery alone will not save
us. We may have to meet the Bkilled
soldiers of scientific peoples. ' But,
on the, other hand, we do not want to
become too war-like a nation, for that
would, some think, invite trouble, and
harden our own hearts. . It is time for
deep thought, prayer, and above all,
single-hearted devotion to American
ideals. - Our navy will be our ' main
bulwark of safety. I wish all your
readers could go through the navy
yard at Washington and see the can
non being turned out there. Many
of them are five feet thick , at the
base, sixty feet long, and weigh 100,
000 pounds each, ani , can throw a
1200-pound projectile 15 miles. You
can see hundreds of these monsters
slowly turning in the lathes which
are shaping them up for use, and
thousands of men are at work at as
many different machines, shaping up
the numberless parts of the gnn, car
riage, projectiles, etc. Some of these
guns'are mounted on "disappearing"
carriages', which allow them to rise
up out of a pit, fire, and fajl back out
of (he way of the enemy's fire.
Many of these cannon are built up
in layers, or "jackets" as they are
called, the first long tube of thick
steel haying one jacket after another
shrunk on it while very hot, so that
in cooling it is like one piece. Some
times the long tube is wound with
square steel wire, drawn on while it
is turning, the wire stretched with a
pulling strength of thousands of
pounds. That makes a very strong
gun. The Aero Club of America
wants us to spend four hundred , mil
lions of dollars in providing aero
planes and air ships to float in the air
all around our coast lines, and warn
us or fight when the ( enemy's ship
cornea in sight. Rising to a height
of a mile or more, these war-ships of
the sky could drop explosives on the
ariips on the sea,' and make it hard
for an enemy to bombard our shores.
And if the great Zeppelin air-ships
now dropping bombs on London and
Paris should be so perfected that
they can cross the ocean to our
shores, we certainly will have to fight
them with air craft as well.
How grand it would be, if the prin
ciples of Jesaa could govern this
planetl But the Bible itself is full of
le3sons of self-defense, and the peace
propaganda of William J. Bryan is
now almost universally regarded as
untimely. His picture is ridiculed in
the theaters, and he Is just now one
of the most unpopular - Americans.
Some day his principles will prevail,
but they will not do now. There is
no use for quotirg the Golden Rule
when you see a burglar climbing the
back stairs with his pistol drawn!
Bryan is a great man. 1 saw his sig
nature, at'' the Russian Embassy in
Washington, on an abitration treaty
between this country and Russia, and
he has signed a couple of dozen of
them with other countries'. But what
good did a treaty do the countries of
Europe in August, 1914?
I;pray, with Daniel Webster, that I
may never behold the downfall, of
thia glorious republic; that the silver
streams of Tennessee may never run
red with blood of friend or foe, as
the rivers have done in Europe now
for many a day; that my life and that
of all who are now living, may pass
away in the course of nature before
an alien footstep shall soil our hal
lowed ground. Stronger than love of
parent for child, of man for woman,
of the miser for his gold, or even the
hope of a better life in the hereafter,
is the tie that binds us to our native
land1. And the flag that exemplifies
that land we will know fully what it
means when it waves over our hosts
advancing to defend it from an invad
er from without, 1
W know not what the future holds,
Nor where that flag may bid us go,"
But, gathered 'neath Ita radiant folds,
W fear no earthly foe.
The Hand that Mfeljr led at here
Will make our path and purpose clear.
Our Chieftain bld together draw
The holt that lore onr land and law;
Let 111 the other ttand adde
Go back acroat the ocean wide!
Through all the best, through all the wont,
America be ever flrt! .

Mr. Lewis Carter, who is at the

Mr. Will Smith has put in a small
stock of goods in his store 1 mile
south of here, and is well pleased
with hfs business.
It ia an unusual thing to have a
cold drink stand open to the public
on preaching days, here,-but such
was the case Sunday, doing a lucra
tive business. ' While it may not be a
violation of the law, or no serious
harm, we think the public should rise
up against it.
Rev. Phillips, accompanied by Revs.
Blanchard andCace, filled his appoint
ment here Saturday an Sunday, and
the best behavior we have ever seen
on this occasion. Just a , few got
loaded, but their friends kept them
out of sight of the officers. We hope
these few will be bo ashamed that
such will never, occur again. '

C Sunday School Convention.'
-v May 10, 1916.
The McNairy County and West
Hardin Connty Sunday School Con
vention will be held at Adamsville, on
the 22nd and 23rd of July. This is a
departure from the date as fixed at
the former meeting, but the State
Secretary, Hon. Joseph Carthel, asks
that this date be used, if possible, so
that he may attend the Convention of
this Association.
It is very important to have the
date so he can attend as he is the
only worker whose entire time is de-

I voted to the Sur.d iy School work we
can hope to have with us.
Besides, the date formerly fixed is
in conflict with a District Conference,
to be held at Selmer, and thia date
was not known when the original date
was fixed for Xhis Convention, and
this would be an unfortunate conflict
which would "keep quite a' number
away from the Convention who would
attend if held at a nqn-conflicting
date. ,-, -"' . y
These reasons and. some . others
have operated with the County . and
District 'Officers and jthe data is
therefore fixed as above.
Let all remember JULY 22 & 23.
Fuller announcement wilt be made
later as to the program. r .
The District Convention for the
Second District will be held at Sandy
Flatt on June 4. Other District Con
ventions will be held between this and
the date for the County Convention,
and due notice will be given of same.
