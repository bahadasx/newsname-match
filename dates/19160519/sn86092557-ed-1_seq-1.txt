|{J. F. Parsons Assaulted In
[ Broad Day Light at
Colfax Station.
IS ADVISED TO LEAVE
Says He Will Pay No Atten
tion to Threats Against
Life.
[ Yesterday morning G. F. Parsons,
I an organizer sent Into this section of,
1 Re state by the Socialists and who
??, Seen quite active left the city for!
\)'j?* on the 7.10 train dressed neatly .
raking freal1, and healthy. Some
during the afternoon ho appear
J the atreeta with ono black eye,
JJollen and bleeding nose, an car
with coagulated blood, i c?'
^5aed wound behind that car and the
general appearance of a man who had
been thrown through a rail fence.
Parson's explanation for the cliange
in his appearance was simplicity Itself.
5e had been the recipient of the earn
feat attentions of n pair of well dress
ed and cold blooded thugs who had de
liberately beaten him up tu broad day
"According to the 8tory Par?on? toU
when he got back to l-airm?i>t ?h n
he went to the ticket orncc ottlie
Baltlmoro and Ohio railroad to bus a
ticket a man about his own size (he
His about medium height and a bit
overweight) stood right close to the
brass railing. After Parsons
moved away from the window this
fellow slapped down 15 cents and also
demanded a ticket to Colfax
At the time Parsons attached no
particular significance to the Incident
5 and he did not become suspicious ev
en when two mon bosldo himself
alighted from the train at Ills destina
tion. The third fellow was a small
man wearing what Parsons describes
as an expenslvo overcoat. This the
little fellow began to peel off as soon
stopped from the train. The
J flashed through ?'nrpons mind
e two were going to take a
iroBS the country for some pur
It was not long, however, hf.
i had occasion to change his
opinion, for without a word, the two
fellowB hit him a stinging hie".1"
the face which spun him around but
did not knock him down. Then while
his face was turned around from the
precious pair he was tilt ?nind the
ear and he went down. Ills Impres
slon Is that the blow was delivered |
bv the little fellow who did not say,
a word throughout tne encounter.
HOW often he was hit after that Par
sons docs not know, anil ho has not
yet had tlmo to count his wounds.
Howevor. before they let htm up tli*j
big follow kicked him several times
In-the face. i
When they <11(1 let lilm up the big
fellow said to him that he hail hotter
leave the country or ne would be
killed. Then as the entertainment 1
committee was moving off tho little
fellow found his voice long enough to;
make a suggostlon that Parsons hnd;
better go to a nearb>- farmhouse that
lie Indicated with a wave of his hand j
"and get washed up." But by this,
Mmo Parsons' suspicions had been
thoroughlv aroused ana not knowing
just what sort of a reception lie would
get at a place so recommended lie,
moved off in the direction of I-ali
mont. Eventually he met a man who
took hlni to the home of J. B. W eakley i
who lives near Colfax. There ho was
cleaned up as well as might he but.
when ho got back to town his trousers
were still spotted with blood that had I
flowed from his nose and the wounds,
on his head and ear. t
The assault took place where the ,
train stops nt the Colfax station and
it was witnessed by two women who
were standing in front of the post
office which is hard by. Parsons (Iocs ?
not know the names of these two wom
en nor if there were any more witness
es 'His purpose in going to Colfax
?was to post notices announcing a
(speech which he Intends to make in
that town Saturday night. He declar
ed this morning that the beating up
that he got will not have the slightest
effect upon his program and that the
speech will bo made just as ho Intend-1

merchant and active member of the

twenty-eighth General Assembly oj
the Presbyterian church took the first;
step in tho cstabli9hement of a pro-!
