WELSH HIGH SCHOOL CLOSES
MOST SUCCESSFUL SESSION
IN ITS HISTORY--1916
The closing exercises of the High
School began last Sunday with the
Commencement Sermon before a
large audience of patrons and friends
of the school at the Aditorium. The
sermon was preached by Rev. E. M.
Stewart. An excellent program of
special music for the occasion was
rendered, accompanying the service.
Today, Friday, May 19, 1916, marks
the closing of the most successful
term of the Welsh High School, tea-.
chers and scholars having worked to
gether most harmoniously during the
past nine months for the advance
ment of the educational interests of
the community, and the results of
their efforts are a source of much
pride to teachers, scholars, pupils
and all concerned.
In the graduating class of 1916 are
r six young ladies, Misses Marion Funk,'
- Lillian Carroll, Mary Yantis, Estner
f Wright, Lena Bates and Mabel Shoe
maker, who have received their lau
- rels with the satisfaction lent by theirI
having been well earned. Sivteen pu-.
pils from the seventh grade were
given certificates of entry to the high'
n school.
The graduating exercises were held
e at the Auditorium last night, when
the following program was carried
out: Selections, Welsh Band; Proces
sional; Invocation, Rev. E. M. Stew
art; Chorus, "Over the Meadows
Fair;," Address, Rev. Ferguson, of
Jennings; Vocal Duet, Miss Lallie
h Murphy and Mr. Elmer Harris; Pre
4+ sentation of Certificates, Supt. W. P.
Arnette; Presentation of Diplomas,
Prof. I. R. Aylesworth; Chorus,
"Wherd the Rippling Waters Flow;"
Benediction, Rev. E. M. Stewart.
The closing event in the school year
is the annual High School Play,
which are being staged at the audi
torium tonight at eight o'clock. "Six
e Cups of Chocolate," by the six young
e ladies of the graduating class, is a
b most appropriate selection, the scene
e taken from a college town in New
England, in the early spring, and the
romance and sentimer.tality they will
lend to its production will surpass the
authors fondest imagination.
n "The Happy Family of Father
r time," presented by scholars from the
. greades is a musical depiction of the
passing of old man Father Time, in
0 which Father Time reviews the work
n of his children, the seconds, minutes,
!t hours and days, while the Thief of
n Time, with the assistance of Hope,
- Patience, Love and Duty frustrates
his plans. The characters in this
d play' are: Father Time, Ben Gold
L- smith; Monday, Ollie Belle Howery;
h Tuesday, Myrtle Bottorff; Wednes
n day, Aline Armstrong; Thursday, Ma
- bel Robin; Friday, Elizabeth Stewart;
g Saturday, Aline Greer; Patience, Ra
chel Wright; Love, Florence Hebert;
Hope, Frida Scoggins; Duty, Hilda
SCarr; Thief of Time, Olive Scoggins.
r During the term of school just clos
'. ing the Domestic Science course has
- been added, and to the teacher, Miss
SHarlin, much credit is due for the ac
t complishments of the class under her
7 direction.
r The Manual Training class, too, un
0 der the able direction of Prof. Ayles
. worth, has made remarkable ad
s I vancement.
o An exhibit of the accomplishments
b of the Domestic Science and Manual
. Training departments in the sewing
- room of the Domestic Science build
- ing Wednesday afternoon was large
Sly attended, and the samples of the
Shandiwork of the scholars in these
ie classes furnished ample proof of the
bnefits of industrial training in the
pu1lic schools.
It is regretted that five of the tea
chers who have labored so industrious
ly for the advancement of the school,
8. and who have thus become endeared
. to the community, will not be with
i- as as teachers the coming term. In
y, this connection it has been suggested
that at least a few of the teachers are
ie onritemplating a small private school
I., (one pupil). Be it as it may, it is
known that during the past term one
r- of the most valued teachers has lis
ie tened to the lure of domestic bliss.
g, An effort, directed by Mrs. W. E.
e- Faught, former teacher in the pri
n mary department, is being made to
convert the Public School Library in
to a community library during the D
summer months, and in this event the t'
library books will be removed to the t
sewing room of the Domestic Science v
building, where the public, and more )
espec.ally the school children, w%
have their use during the vacation. 3
Plans of this feature are not com- c
plete as yet, but will be announced r
at an early date. o
The public school is coming more j
and more to be first in the thought \
and esteem of the community. It is
a community's greatest asset and f
our community has been peculiarly a
fortunate in our public school facil- a
ities. J
A NEAT EXHIBIT.
The exhibit in the Domestic Sci
ence building of the Welsh High
School Wednesday afternoon, when 0
open reception was held, has fully de- t
monstrated the worth of these branch- a
es of education to the patrons of the g
school, and to the community. The
marvelous accomplishments of the t
students in these departments during ,
'the first seven months of their train- r
ing Imust be seen to be appreciated. N
If the skeptics who argue against the i
induction of these, what they term o
new departures in educational lines, c
wpuld pay an occasional visit to the o
school, there is no doubt of their suf- 1
fering an immediate change of heart. d
In the' Maual Training department, t
under the direction of Prof. Ayles- t
worth, the boys have been taught the t
tare and use of tools, the planning
and execution of delicate cabinet a
work. Using the toughest specimens a
of timber they have turned out some r
excellent articles of furniture, tables,
stools, book racks, medicine cabinets, a
picture frames, etc., all done and fin- t
ished in the neatest possible manner.
In this class are Ben Goldsmith. Hil- t
ton Findley, Gettys Doan, Jeff Mont
gomery, Wilbur Gabbert, Robert Ar
ceneaux, Fahy Godfiey, Wilford Shoe
maker, Willie Day, Elmer Harris,
Robert Greer, Richie Mason, Vernon
Scoggins and Robert Sullivan, each
I of whom had a very neat exhibit of .1
his handiwork.
The cooking and sewing depart
ments are under the very able direc
Stion of Miss Harlin, under whose care
I ful guidance the young ladies have
t made rapid strides in domestic lines,
'We understand that at the beginning
f some of these young ladies would have
had no trouble in sewing on a button
on their gown, or boiling water with
s out burning it, but as their exhibits
show, they are very proficient at this
time.
In the sewing class are the Misses
Frida Goldsmith, Marjorie Robinson,
Esther Wright, Lena Bates, Mary
Yantis, Lillian Carroll, Mable Shoe
rhaker, Marion Funk, Anna Cox and
I Helen Hackworth. The articles of em
:]broidery, crochet, dress making and
lingerie must be seen to be appreciat
ed.
i The kitchen is a model of right
principles, good order and cleanliness,
rand the class, Misses Corine Brad
bury, Edna B. Bourgeois. Hazel He
-bert, Fern VanNess, Violet Bottorff,
Phoebe Hackworth and Litha Litch
field, were busy serving delicious
strawberry punch and cakes to the
svisitors.
STATEMENT.
In my address on the presentation
Sof High School certificates, I made the
Sremark that while I was visiting the
Sschools I witnessed a history recitation
taught by a young man, an L. S, U.
graduate, and that undoubtedly the
lesson was a miserable failure. Upon
investigation I stated that this failure
d was due to the fact that during the
Sweek the young man had gone to three
n dances.
d I am very sorry that among the
I audience there were some who thought
I I was referring to Mr. A. S. H. Trap
Spey, a young man, an L. S. U. graduate
e and a teacher of history. I had abso
- lutely no reference to this young man,
and he certainmy does not deserve such
Sa cbaracterization. Furthermore, I
- consider him one ol the best teachers
o in this parish.

5,000 MlEAI) OF CATTLE SHIPPED I
FROM THIS SECTION
Those who are won t to think that
the stock industry in this section is
of small magnitude we would cite to
the records of the past two weeks,
during which time one stockman,
Mr. A. R. McBurney, has shipped from
this section nearly 5,000 head of cat
tle. Of these shipments 1,400 head st
went to T. E. Wilson, CedarVale,
Kansas; 600 head to J. L. Borum,
Cedar Vale, Kansas; 650 yearlings to so
Morrison & Cooper, Earl, Ark.; 500
cows and two-year olds to J. W. Har
ris, Alexandria, La.; and a shipment
of 1700 made by Mr. McBurney and
J. W. Gardiner to J. L. Borum, Cedar
Vale, Kansas.
Reduced to dollars and cents the
fruits of these transactions covering C
a period or a half-month means the it
addition of a considerable wealth to I

COMING PARAMOUNT FEATURES w
The Paramount program at the Au
ditorium for the coming week will
present two fine features, "The Se
cret Sin," and "The Masqueraders."
On Wednesday, May 24th, Blanche
Sweet will be seen in "The Secret
Sin," a strong photo-play concerning f
the drug evil. This is the first op- ,
Sportunity that local patrons of the ,
-novies have had of seeing this very p
[popular actress and as Miss Sweet ,
appears as "twins" there are episodes c
in the play when she appears in two a
Scharacters simultaneously.
Hazel Dawn will return on Friday, J
May 26 in a comedy drama, "The
Masqueraders," in which she is said i
to do some of the most remarkable 4
work of her career. Miss Dawn has
been seen at the Auditorium in sever- t
Sal photoplays, all of them good, but
Sthis one promises to be even better (
Sthan the preceding ones.
S"Peg O' the Ring," a serial animal
e drIma, full of the life of the circus,
o will follow Pauline on June 15th.' This r
e is something that is entirely unique I
e in the way of picture play
FORD RIDE APPRECIA D
t The Seniors are very appreciative
of the good time given them Satur
e day, April 29th, by Messrs. Willie
. Day and Elmer Harris. The class
, was taken on a Ford ride to Lake
I Charles, where they went to see the
SLew bridge now being constructed
soer the Calcasieu river. The party
started from Welsh early in the after
noon attd returned that evening. I
KEEP HEALTH BOARH
OUT OF POLITICS
That Dr. Dowling has given the
state a thorough, intelligent, non
partisan and efficient administration
of its health and sanitation is univer
sally accepted and believed; that he
has restored confidence in the ability
of the state to cope with every form
of infectious and contagious disease
which has previously deterred the in
vestment of capital, hindered desir
able immigration and depressed our
own people is also universally ac
cepted and believed. i
If Dr. Dowling has made enemies,
it is well recognized by every think
ing citizen of the state why he has
incurred this opposition;, that is, be
cause of his uncomprising honesty of
his own convictions and because of a
sincere desire to serve the people. He
has waged the most systematic and
effective fight against dirt and dis
ease ever carried on anywhere in the
United States.
Dr. Dowling is a national figure
and much of the work inaugurated by
him has been copied throughout the
country. Many are following his sys
tem of lectures on health and hygiene,
the Louisiana health train, the water
survey, the monthly and quarterly
bulletins, communicable disease in
vestigations, and other features of
his activities not generally known to
all the people even of his own state.
The conclusion is irresistible that
Dr. Dowling should be reappointed.
We believe efficiency will be the
keynote of the incoming administra
tion and we feel that no such mis
take will be made as to remove him
from office a man of such ability and
fitness as Dr. Dowling has shown
himself to be.
The people want protection of
health, betterment of sanitar, condi
tions and any movement which would
deter present progress along these
lines would be most unfortunate and
unpopular.
PIZZINI WILL DEMONSTRATE.
A. M. Pizzini, landlord of the Piz
zini hotel in Crowley, returned Mon
day from New Orleans, where he met
President Frank Godchaux of the
Louisiana State Rice Milling compa
ny, and the representatives of other
large rice milling interests in Louisi
ana, and completed arrangements
whereby he will soon begin his work
as rice demonstrator. Mr. Pizzini had
already secured the support of the
rice millers of the Crowley section
and expects to secure that of the
Lake Charles and Beaumont mills.
A meeting of those who are support
ing the demonstration movement will
be called in Crowley at an early date,
when the plans for the demonstration
campaign will be perfected and fi
nancial arrangements made for car
rying out the work.
ODD FELLOWS ANNIVERSARY
The 97th anniversary of the Inde
pendent Order of Odd Fellows was
fittingly observed Sunday, May 7th
with services at the auditorium. The
services .had been announced at the
Presbyterian church, but as the crowd
which gathered was beyond the capa
city of the church the meeting was
adjourned to the Auditorium.
The Rev. W. Lomax Childress, D.
D., of Roanoke delivered a very ap
propriate sermon, and the program
included special music by the Presby
terian choir.
Odd Fellows and Rebekahs attended
the services in a body and there were
present many visitors from Lake
Charles, Jennings, and Roanoke.
