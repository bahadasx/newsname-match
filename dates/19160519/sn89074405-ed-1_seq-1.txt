PORK-BARREL MUSTT
BE DONE AWAY WITH
Wilson Administrate
Taken no Step Tj
Preparedness,
Detroit, Mich-, Slay/ 19.—Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt in' an address
here today, reiterated his opposition
"to all kinds of hyphenated American
lam." advocated unlverslay military
service baaed on universal training,
and declared that fe mutt abolish
"pork-barreI" method* in our nation
al defense, atop talking and get down
to the actual business of thorough
preparedness if we fan "to make this
nation aa strong as are its convictions
In reference to right and wrong."
Colonel Rooseyelt prefaced his
speech by announcing that he had
"come here to Michigan because In
the primary for the selection of dele'
gates to the Republican National Con
vention. Mr. Ford was victorious, and
following on his victory here, he
showed a marked popular strength in
Nebraska and Pennsylvania. The ef
fect of this showing has been Immedi
ately visible upon many of the poli
ticians within and without congress."
"We, through our representatives at
Washington," said COlonel Roosevelt,
"have absolutely refused in the small
est degree to prepare during these
twenty-two months' of world eata
'clvsm. We have refused to learn the
smallest part of the lesson being writ
ten on the scroll of torment In Bur
ope. We have fatuously refused to
take the smallest step, either to do
our duty to ourselves or to do our
duty to Others. We have endeavored
to deceive ourselves by announolng
that in this policy of supine Inaction
and of failure to perform duty, we
are actuated by the loftiest motives,
doubt whether We have really deceiv
ed ourselves, and most certainly we
have not deceived others. There is
not a nation In the world whloh be

"In any sarlouajcrisis there are SS
way*
dsel-
to wqrk up some
compromise,'' In actual practice, this
compromise usually proves to com
bine with exquisite nicety all the de
fects and none of the advantages of
both courses. It is true that In or
dinary political matters, compromise
is essential. It is true that In or
dinary times it is essential. But there
come-great crises when compromise Is
-either Impossible or fatal. This is
one of those crises. There is no use
in saying that we will fit ourselves to
defend ourselves a little, but not
much. Such a'position is equivalent
to announcing that, if necessary, we
shall hit, but that we shall only hit
sift. The only right principle is to
prepare thoroughly or not at all. The
only right principle is to avoid hit
ting if it Is possible .to do so, but nev
er under any circumstances to hit
soft. To go to war a little, but not
much, is the one absolutely certain
way to ensure disaster. To prepare
a little but not much, stands on a par
with a city developing a lire depart

"Iluy have flocked to us in this

Lord Derby was not a novice at en

SOCIAL SERVICE
AND EVANGELISM
Minneapolis, May 19.—A broader
interpretation of "evangelism" to in
clude the "whole work of teaching
men the good will of God, announcing
the good news of forgiveness, winning
them unto Christ and training them
for life and service in the kingdom"
was given by the Rev. Samuel Z. Bat
ten in an address at the Northern
Baptist convention here. Mr. Batten
spoke before the American Baptist
Publication society.
Quoting the text: "He went about
doing good." Mr. Batten found war
rant for his topic, "Evangeliam
Through Social Service," in the "life
and teaching of the Master."
"We have no right to insert ouf
own notions into the Master's teach
ings but we have no right to leave
anything out of his commission to
suit our own convenience," he said.
"Thus what we call evangelism and
social service stand on an equality in
the Master's commission.
"It may be noted that social service
Is a spirit and a method rather than a
program and platform. In this it
is like religion itself. There are no
special things that can be called re
ligious religion is rather the spirit of
life the temper of the soul. To the
religious man, everything he does has
a religious value. To the social work
er there are no special things and
duties that can be called social serv
ice. Social service is rather the spirit
of his life, the outreach of his pur
pose. He does the will of God along
the line of his daily life and he seeks'
the kingdom in and through the in
stitutions of which he Is a part.
"Would a man do social service
work? Then let him know the pur
pose of God In the world. Then let
him know the meaning and function
of the family and make it fulfill its'
divine end. Let him know thait ftill
mission of the church asnd find his
place in Its fellowship and'its. work.
Let him- go out into his community
and seek the kingdom of God by'mak
ing its customs sincere, its ordinances
Just, its life pure, Its order heavenly.
Let him realise that the industrial
order is the mean^ through which God
gives men dally bread, and then seek
to secure for. every worker living
wage/ to establish Industrial brother*!^
hood and get industrial lite on a.
Christian basis. The end which wevA
seek ieChristian Social service which
uses the means leading to the end la,
no less Christian."
