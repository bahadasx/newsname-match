she happened to see a lady's name on
the bottom of the box. She turned
the box over to John and the same

Baughman office window. The name
Inscribed thereon is Velma Wilson,

name of the lady who . packed that
particular box of berries. John sus
pects that the lady in question is
' matrimonially inclined, and being of
-a helpful nature, he is willing to ad
vertise her to the extent of keeping
ier name where the love-lorn lads of
Liberal can gaze upon it. This Ut

DR. OHSLER'S THEORY FALLS
FLAT AGAIN
(By Ray Millman)
E. Dudley, former mayor of Liber
al, old time railroad promoter,
ranchman, a philosopher and one of
the people who helped in a material
way to make Liberal the capital city
of the southwest, arrived from
Shreveport, Louisiana, last Saturday
evening. -He traversed the entire dis
tance, 915 miles, in his Maxwell and
did it in six days.
The trip is a record in that he is
82 years of age and was his own
driver and mechanician and was
alone. Says he encountered much
muddy roads, but in spite of that he
made an average of about 153 miles
per day. He is enjoying health. He
went there a few months ago with
the idea of bettering his health and
be appears to have secured that
which he sought. "Think I feel as,
good as any fellow my age ought to
feel," asserts Mr. Dudley, but he ad
mits that he does not expect to live

The roads in Louisiana are fine,
and as a general thing the people
there take pride in keeping the roads
In good shape. There are some good
roads in Texas, but as he neared Ok
lahoma and finally reached KanBas
the travel was not so smooth. Mr.
Dudley says that the trip was not at

a tire was punctured.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
MEETING
Five good talks were given at the
Chamber of Commerce meeting held
last Friday night. The talks were
along the line of what can be accom
plished tor Liberal throughout the
Chamber of Commerce and were
profitable and inspiring as well as en
tertaining. Mr. Bert Hobble spoke shortly on
"How a Chamber of Commerce Could
Have Benefited Liberal In the Past."
His principal Idea was that If we had
had a Chamber of Commerce In the
past the men of the town would hare
been educated to work together for
the good of Liberal and we would be
in better position to get big things
for the town now. The speaker of
fered many valuable suggestions
along the lines of what we need sow.
Among other things was the beauti
fying of the streets and buildings,
better schools, and a good auditori
um for the town meetings.
Mr. O. D. Nlchol spoke on "What
benefit I expect to derive from my
membership In the Chamber of Com
merce." He invited the business
men of the town and those Interest
ed in the Farmers' Institute to attend
the next meeting of that organisa
tion. He spoke of how much good
roads were needed and the benefit
the people of the town and farmers
alike would derive from them. He
recommended the Chamber of Com
merce as the place for the farmers
and town people to get together and
work out the problems which mean
so much to both.
Mr. Scheark made an interesting
talk telling of the construction and
maintenance of the new sewerage
system now being installed. After
his talk several questions were asked
and a general discussion was held
which proved very beneficial to the
entire meeting.
Mr. W. H. Graves gave a very in
teresting and entertaining talk on
"Why a man should Join the Cham
ber of Commerce." His talk fol
lowed the lines that It you do not
want your business to amount to any
thing you do not boost it and the
same thing applies to your town. His
idea was It you want your business
to grow and develop you advertise It
and push It and that is what Is neces
sary to do with your town.
Mr. H. A. Gasklll talked on "What'
the Chamber of Commerce can do for
Liberal In the future." His talk was
made up of suggestions of the things
which can be accomplished for the
town. He gave the Idea that we have
a good town and a good place to live
and now what we want Is a better
town and a better place to live.
There are many things which we can
do to held our town and now Is the
time to start to do them.
The big thing which the meeting
accomplished was to get before the
members the number of things that
can be accomplished by the members
working together for the good of Lib
eral. These things were Hated and it
is the purpose of the organization to
take each one up at the proper time
and work for everything that is for
the good of the town and surround
ing country.
