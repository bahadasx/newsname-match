Teutons Fail In France and Their
Attacks Against Belgians
Are Repulsed
(AuMClatad Praia by Federal Wlrslass.)
LONDON, May l!i The Germans
me nuain striving to put into execu
tion their fnnioiw "H,uee3ic" tactics
iig!iint the French at Avocourt, and
Hill .'104, but without success, accord
ing to tho French . reports. " Indeed,
Paris declares that the French troops
in those sectors hne made marked
guins of ground, Inning captured a
Germnu fortified pimitiou north of Hill
SOI.
The Teutonic effort aimed at the
French redoubt cant of Avocourt prov
ed a fontly one, the attackers' losses
having been heavy. The French offi
cial atati'inent uiUIm that the losses of
the Germans along the Verdun front,
where night attackB were attempted,
were exceptionally henvy.
The Germans have nlso failed to win
anything by their night attack, follow
ing a prolonged artillery preparation,
against the Helgiuu positions north of
SfeeiiHtruete. Here the Teutona sent
their infantry against the positions
held by King' Alfred, lint the Belgian
machine guiiH proved too much for the
uttui'kers, who fled hack "to their own
trenches after several charges. None
of them reached the first line of the
Belgian trenches.
In the minor theaters of war the
fighting has been more lively thun of
lute. The British war office press
bureau announced lul night that a
British column hnd struck a heavy
Mow nt the tiiliesmen headed by
Tuikish officers, at Hnvoud and Magei

Bin olid was destroyed with the loss of
