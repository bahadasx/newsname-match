Paddy Johnston's Welcome
Paddy Johnston, the veteran timber j
scout, was in Flagstaff Friday from
Bellemont He is now a homesteader
and is located right close to the
big caves north of Bellemont He
snvs he is going to post up a sign
right along the road where visitors
can sec it, reading: "All are wel
come: come after breakfast, bring
your dinner and leave before supper
accommodations for man and beast"
Of course such a sign before his cabin
door would only be a joke to anvonc
who knew him, for the only thing he
wouldn't give a friend or one in need,
is something that he hasn't got or
could not get.

As-essor Makes Indian. Pay Taxes
County Assessor J. D. Dunn accom -
panied by James Swinnerton returned
last Saturday from a trip over into

uic umuui "-i ....... .
Dunn had gone to collect taxes of the
Indians for personal property, in ac -
cordancc with the recent decisjon of
the state authorities and Indian Com
missioncr. It took them some time
to convince thc Indians that they
should pay their share of taxes, but
even dt that, they still have the idea
in mind that it is taxes for grazing
their stock off the reservation, rather
than a personal property tax.
During their stay over there Mr.
Swinnerton, who is well acquainted '
with the Indians and their character,!
says there was a marked change inlfle"10" """
thc demeanor of the Indians toward ' believing that some other deserving

in which Supt. Runke was indicted.

The Normal Class of '16 have pre
pared a very meritorious booklet
covering their class ypar with pic
tures of the graduating class which
will perpetuate their memory as one
of the big classes that claim the
Northern Arizona Normal school as
their Alma Mater; in historic event
that will never fade from the memory
of that particular class and one that
will grow brighter as the years go .by
until the silvery hair comes, and the
certain knowledge of the inevitable
end of all that is human, breaks
golden upon their maturity of
thought and christalizes in the final
dlnmond brilliancy of the life well

FOREST SERVICE TO START
WORK ON WINSLOW-LONG
.VALLEY ROAD
Notice has just been received at the
Forest Supervisor's office in Flagstaff
that the District Forester plans to
start construction work on the Long
Valley-Winslow road the latter part
of June.
The survey work on this project
was done last summer by a party of
i surveyors from the District Forcst-
j ers office in Albuquerque, N. Mex.,
, covering the road from Long Valley
IA f nfltnf " ll IT WllIMl'jl WAHaIi
to a point north of Sutton's ranch.
Most of the work that will be done
will be on the road over Blue Ridge
and will eliminate the heavy grades
on the present road. A new route has
been laid out over Blue Ridge which
will materially cut down the distance
between Long Valley and Winslow.
It is understood that the people in
I Winslow, as well as Coconino county,
' are planning to do considerable work
, on the Long Valley-Winslow road,
Coconino county having already start-
cd the construction of a steel bridge
over Jack's Canyon. The completion
of this road will be of inestimable
i value to the settlers and stockmen in
I the Long Valley-Clear Creek section.
About June 1 the Forest Service
plans to start actual construction
work on what is known as thc Salt
River-Pleasant Valley road. A large
number of men and teams will be
needed for this work. Any parties
wishing to get work for themselves
or teams should write to Mr. O. N.
que, N. M., arrived in Flagstaff on
May 10, en route to the Fort Valley
Experiment Station, where he will be
permanently assigned. Mrs. Porcher
is tiow in California and will join her
husband at Fort Valley later.
Ranger W L. Scoficld from Spring-
ervillc, is now assisting Ranger John
Vandevier at the A L & T. logging
camps.
Mr. Arthur Koehler from the U. S.
Foret Products Laboratory at Madi-

WILL BE THE BIGGEST
THING EVER HELD IN FLAG
& Fred Hensing may be a little
hard of hearing but he thinks
easy. He is an Elk and if there
is a new Elks' home in Flagstaff,
he will have done his share in
5 financing a large chunk of it.
The city has turned over a whole
block to him for the two days
, and he proposes to see that there
will be more unique things doing
on that block for the two days v
than evr happened before or
will again. He proposes to issue
a quantity of Elk money that
can .be spent at any place in
town for any old thing; booths
where all sorts of things will be
doing, including a parcel post ?
office, a '49 camp, a corral of
"whooff-wooffs," pens of wip- ?
wpllons and other such curiosi-
tiei He is organizing his forces ?
iWnow and savs that people have
, not yet 'awakened to the fact
that this celebration is not going
to be anv ordinary sort of an
affair, but an affair that will go
.down in history as the biggest
stunt ever pulled off in Northern
Arizona.
