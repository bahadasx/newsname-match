Lake Mohonk Conference Con
siders Unsettled International
Affairs in Platform
MANY ARE DISAPPOINTED
Taft's League Given No En-1

ents Displeased, Too
By Associated Press
Mohonk X. Y., May 19.—The
resolutions committee of the Lake Mo- 1
honk Conference on International Ar- j
bitration to-day showed its appre- i
elation of the unsettled condition of i
international affairs by presenting a!
platform which avoided any radical |
recommendations and confined itself l
to carefully worded approval of Ihe ■
general principle of arbitration. The j
platform proved a disappointment to j
members of the League to Enforce)
Peace, headed by ex-President William i
H. Taft, presiding officer of the con
ference. But it also offered no encour
agement to the opponents to enforce
peace, led by William J. Bryan. The
platform follows:
"The world conditions of the past
two years have confirmed the belief'
often expressed in these conferences 1
that arbitration and judicial methods [
should and must increasingly prevail
in settling international disputes.
"During the twentieth century (he!
permanent court at The Hague has
acted upon cases involving questions ;
relating to Europe. Asia. Africa, the •
islands of the Pacific and the three
Americas. These questions involved
financial and territorial claims and
such fundamental matters as the right
to fly the national flag and to exercise
jurisdiction over national military
forces. These facts are clear testi
mony to the development of m bi- j
tration.
» Wants Congress to Act
"The tendency of this court at The j
Hague to become in reality perma- i
nent is evident from the fact that !
ihere are eight judges who have sat
in spven of the eases.
"The conference expresses again Its
firm belief in the desirability of such |
legislation by Congress as will confer I
upon the courts of the United States
jurisdiction over all cases arising under j
treaty provisions or affecting the rights j
of aliens.
The speakers this morning wore j
Ignacio Calderon. Bolivian minister
to the I'ntied States; William P. Bor
land. member of ''ongress from Mis
souri: the Rev. Charles E. Jefferson,
pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle,

Strict Censorship Screens
Fate of Jeremiah C. Lynch
By Associated Press
New v ork, May 19. The fate of
Jeremiah C. Lynch, an American citi
zen. who was to i have been shot at
daybreak In Dublin, is believed to he
screened by strict censorship. No
■word regarding the man -who had
been convicted of complicity in the
Irish rebellion had come over the
tables up to 9 o'clock this morning.
President Wilson made an eleventh
hour plea for a stay of execution just
before midnight last night in Wash
ington. Owing to the difference in
time Lynch was to have faced the
firing squad about 3 hours after
President Wilson had directed that a
c able be sent to London asking that
the execution he deferred until the
American government could make an
Investigation Into the case.
Tt was not known here whether
President Wilson's plea reached the
English authorities In time to save
Lynch from being executed.

Evidence of the heavy toll that
tuberculosis is exacting in the world
war is found in the Exchange of dis
abled prisoners which is being con
ducted through Sweden by Russia and
Austria. One train from the Russian
camps had 80 cases of consumption
among the Austrian prisoners on
board. Three of the victims died
while the train was passing through
this country.
On another train from Russia there
were 30 Austrians who had been rend
ered insane by their sufferings. Three
i trains are now running weekly in each
direction exchanging prisoners who
1 from disease, loss of limbs or mental
I breakdown are unfit for furthei
military service.
