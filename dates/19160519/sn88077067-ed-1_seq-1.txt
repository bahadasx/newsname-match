OHIO CITY
SECTION HAND HELD TO ANSWER
TO VAN WERT GRAND JURY ON
SERIOUS CHARGE
The trial of the case of the state
ng.iinst Clarence Vanover, of Ohio City,
on a charge of criminally assaulting a
young eight-year-old 'rl, is in progress
at Van Wert. The state has called fifteen
witnesses und the def-nse twenty two,
In t lie statements to the Jury, at the op
ening of the trial. It v.as explained that
the state expects to prove the story of
the child, who accuses the prisoner, and
the defense expects to prove a positive
a 11 hi oy accounting tor vanover s wnere
aliouls from the time he quit work until
he was placed under anest. The thread
of the cross-examination of the witnesses
lor the state discloses that the defense
relies, also, on the hope of proof that
the child is not telling the truth and
that tier apt;bility would be in the direc
tion of having inflicted the injury by
her own act.

SEE THE POINT?
In the 1914 campaign hoping to win the
Congressional elections, the A1unn-Smoot-Oallinger
type of narrow republican poli
tician proclaimed from every political
housetop the bold assertion that the bus
iness depression then upon the country
had nothing to do with the European
war but was entirely chargeable to the
Democratic administration. Now this
same outllt loudly asserts that the un
precedented prosperity of the Cnifed
States lias nothing to do with the Dem-
ocr ilic administration but is attributable
solely to the European war. Can you
Deat it?

LL HEALTH BELIEVED TO BE THE
lHUbt Or SUIUlUt
Heturning home from work last Thurs
day evening, John Kobe, St. Marys, found
the dead body of his wife lying on the
bed. Heside the body lay an empty bot
tle, which had contained carbolic acid,
and a note to her husband wtilcn told the
story ot ner suicide, the not read:
"Dear John, this ends all. I will be
tter off in my grave. Goodbve. Dear
John."
Following Is a clipping concerning the
suicide, taken from the St. Alarys Leader:
An ounce and-a halt-ounce bottle, one
them empty, the other containing a
small quantity of carbolic acid, told the
tragedy. Two physicians, making quirk
response to culls, found Airs. Hobv bevond
aid from human agency. The powerful
drug had already laid hold on the Inward
organs. Life lingered however, until
45 p.m.
The drue had been niirchnncrl to nan

It is presumed that long continued Ill
health temporarily deranged the mental
balance and led to self-destruction.
WHO ARE THE GUILTY PAHTIE5?
A drunken man In Detroit was driving
lug an automobile and run over a man,
killing him. The driver was arrested,
convicted and sent to the penitentiary for

when tin' accident occurred did not save
the man from punishment.
The Ohio State Journal, commenting
on the cas ccdltoi tally, says: "For H man

Cold water Chronicle.
The Hoard of Kdiication at their meet

Hugo J. Alimony, superintendent.
Henry Hlaeser, principal.
.Miss Jean Love, Latin and Kngllsh.

.Miss Helle Plait, bin. iin, anu sin
Miss Agnes Schroeler, primary.
At the previous meeting, part of the

ning's meeting, Hugo Anthony and .Miss
Helle Piatt were employed. Mr. Anthony
is a former well known Mercer county
cliool instructor. He served for several
years on the Mercer county ;ioard or

MENDON CANNING FACTORY NOW
A HOME CUNtLHN
Nothing has pleased us more. In a bus
iness way, than the fact that the can
ning factory will soon be run. F. II.
Hamilton & Son, of Lebanon. O., have
purchased the plant, and it will be known
as the Mendon Packing Co., which will
be incoipoi fried a little later on. That
is too good a plant to allow to go to waste
mil ruin. We feel that the original
stock-holders will feel somewhat cumpeti-
ateii if the plant is run lor the benetlt
ot the community.
Air. Hamilton did not get hold oi ine
plant until late, therefore he only expects
.- inn average mis year. i nose men
own (iute a plant at Lebanon for canning
orh. where mey nave neen uomg suc
esful business each year, so they ure
experienced men at the business they are
going into. The elder Air. Hamilton will
move to our town nexi wees ana win
live in the Church of Liod parsonage.
That means so much to our town mar
vervbody should laKe a nano in noosi-
imr it. Had the canning business kept
up as it started a few years ago. with the
natural increase each year, we haven't
any doubt that our community would
have Hie benefit of from $:lo.(lni to $10.nuu
directly and indirectly from this same
justness now.
Finally, we have the plant where we
ave heen wanting it. independent, anu
owned by parties that will move nere, so
