I HASJIARD LUCK
ISeries of Mishaps Turns What
1 Should Have Been Easy 1st
Into Second Place.
PAYSON HIGH TAKES
FIRST ON 25 POINTS
Bowon Spiked In 440, Shurtz Kicks
Over Hurdle, and Conflict in
Events Shuts Out Bunker.
Owing to hard luck nil along the
lino, the B. A. C. track and field team,
which under average conditions should
have captured the state tourney with
many points to spare, took only sec
ond place, the first honors going to
the Payson high school.
To begin with, Junior McConnell
who is regarded as one of the best all
around high school athletes in the
state, and who had a cinche on three
or more firsts, "knocked down three
hurdles in his clnss work," as one
Salt Lake paper put it. and was voted
ineligible by the faculty, This was
misfortuno No. 1.
In the next place, Bowen, who would
undoubtedly have taken first in the
220 and 440 dashes, was spiked badly
at the first turn of the 440, and while
ho made a very plucky run and fin
ished second in this event, notwith
standing his heel was badly lasceratcd
and his shoe off, was nevertheless out
of the running for first places. This
was misfortune No. 2.
For misfortuno No. 3, there was a
conflict between the time for the pole
vault nd the discus throw, and also
the elimination of the hammer throw,
in both of which Bunker was certain
ftm t,'ofmaWn5oints had heMjeen given
WMa an opportunlty-to enter.
vSY1 '' B t10 as misfortune, and tho
Jt ' .i'strnw which broke the camel's back;"
'1capturing first in the hurdles, kicked
over his last hurdle, something he had
not done in practico during the entire
season. This settled fto far as first
place was concerned, and the B. A. C.
emerged from the tournament with 18
points to its credit as against 25 for
the Payson High school. While it was
a sore disappointment to the boys as
well as Coach Christensen, who has
worked hard for the success of his
team, they know how to take defeat,
especially when it is more than half
a victory, and are not sulkinjr in their
tents, but are back to their school
work as usual.
(From the Salt Lake Tribune.)
The 1916 Utah High School Ath
letic association's track and field meet
resulted in a victory for the Payson
high school of Utah county by a scoro
of 25 to Branch Agricultural college's
18. The other schools follow: East
high, 13; Murdock, 11; West high, 9;
North Sanpete, 8; Ogden, 6; Spring
ville, 6; American Fork, 3; Pleasant
Grove, 3; Nephi, 3; L. D. S. U.. 2;
w B. Y. C, 2.
Wf The surprise was the defeat of the
ML Branch Agricultural college boys, who
B wore- strong favorites before tho meet.
B" ' The Payson aggregation won the meet
W' solely on track events, capturing firsts
9j in the 100, 220, 440, relay and hur
dles.
B. A. C. had an unusual run of ill
fortune. First, tho star sprinter, Bow
en, in the 440 was spiked and lost an
l apparently certain first as a result bf
1 yfl the accident. This kept him out of
the 220 and slowed him up for the re
lay. Bunker was expected to annex
.4 points in tho discus throw, but was
t participating in the pole vault and
4 could not engage in both events.
New Discus Record.
With the excoptlon of tho discus
throw, in which Walt Hansen of tho
B. A. C. threw tho oval 108 feet 8 in
ches, there were no new Btato records.
Kay of Ogden held the discus throw
mark, with 101 feet prior to Hansen's
heave.
Macbeth of Payson, with firsts in
the 100 and 220, and George of Mur
dock, with firsts in tho broad and high
jumps, wero tho big individual point
winners. Neilson of North Sanpete
I made eight.
Leonard Bowen, tho B. A. C. star
sprinter, staged a wonderful exhibi
', tlon in the 440, when, after being
JL spiked on the first turn and losing his
J shoe, ho finished the race and led up
)t" f o tho last ten yards, but was beaten
f i out. Ho showed great nerve nd with-
' out a doubt would havo pushed the
btato record closo had ho not been un
dor such a handicap. The crowd gave
tho plucky athlete a big hand when
the fact became known. He wanted
to run in the 220 but his injury could
not be dressed in time. However, he
., was in tho relay.
f 100 Yard Dash Is Close.
I The 100-yard dash was won by Mnc-
i both of Payson in a fairly closo finish.
I with Hibbs of Ogden second and
w Barnes, Enst high, third. Tho event
I wob close and many thought Hibbs
fhad won. Bowen, tho B. A. C. crack,
got a poor start and was never in the
money. Tho time was 10 2.5 seconds. I
Tho Poyson bov again snowed his
class in tho 220. nftor having Ukon

M
He had a safe margin at the tapo, with
Hibbs and Barnes again second aria
third, respectively'. Tho time was
:23 2-5.
In the 440 tho gameness of Bowen
of tho B. A. C. was demonstrated
when he ran tho race under a blir
hnndicap and yet finished second. He
led to the Inst ten varils, but was too
weak to keep the lead. Oberhnnslcy
of Payson was tho winner, with Watts
of the L. D. S. U. third. The time was
:54 3-5.
Half Mile a Thriller.
What was regarded as ono of the
most beautiful exhibitions of tho day
occurred in tho half mile, when Adam
Seetrmiller, B. A. C, led throughout
and had no difficulty in winning. He
showed crreat form and was as fresh
at the finish ns nt tho start. Of tho
entire B. A. C. team ho mado ns rood
a showintr ns any. McCunc of Nenhl
and Wntts of tho L. D. ft. U. finished
in Recond and third positions.
Gordon Wick, the Enst hirh runnor.
surprised 'em nil when ho duplicated
his feat of beating out Warden of the
West hicrh. It was said in the division
meet that Wick's victory was a fluke
and ho couldn't do it nenln in n life
time, but ho showed them vosterdnv
and proved his worth. His time was
4:R3. exceptionally fast time. Warden
finished second and Funk, also of tho
West hlrh, third.
New Hurdle Champ.
The hurdles saw th 1915 winner
Shurtz beaten bv Mills of Pavson bv
a few Inches. Tho finish was excen
Honallv close and hnd it not boon for
Shurtz's knockintr down the Inst hurd
lo he mieht have won. Shurtz said
nfter tho race that it was tho first
hurdle he hod kicked over this season
Tarvls won over Thorloy of the B. A
C. for third place by another closo
finish.
In tho relay tho East hich led un
to the final ten Yards, but Barnes
didn't have sufficiont strenfth to keen
up the pace and Pavson won bv a few
vnrds manrin. B. A. C. was third.
Georcre of Murdock was first in the
hieh jump with a leap of 5 feet 8 in
ches. Walker of Pleasant Grove wns
second and Kesler of Murdock third.
Georgo took another first in tho
broad jump with 20 feet 5 inches.
Winsr of American Fork and Johnson
of4 tho West high won second and
third. Johnson and Kesler of Mnr
jock wero tied for third, but in the
flnaUjumpJohn8dn-Woriioutv,
Tho Weight EventsT
Neilson in tho shot put upset all
predictions when ho heaved the shot
42 feet 5 inches, which wns too much
for the remainder of tho field. John
son of the West hitrh and Hansen of
B. A. C. finished second and third, both
petting marks better than 40 feet.
Hansen of the B. A. C. beat out
Brown of the East hich in tho discus
throw by eight inches. Both heaved
the oval in good form and had the
other contestants completely out
classed. Weight of Springvlllo, with a vault
of 11 feet 2 inches, won first in the
pole vault. Others to place were Niel
son of North Sanpete and Bunker of
the B. A. C.
For the Good of All.
J. W. Paxman returned from the
Kanab country yesterday and last
night met with some of the land own
ers at tho library auditorium in thp
interests of his colonization project,
which he states is meeting with con
siderable favor on the part of loca.l
neople, but would proceed much morb
rapidly if some more of the holders
of largo tracts of land in tho valley
would list up more of their property.
It is certainly a movement in the in
terests of the wholo people, and own
ers of largo tracts should privc over
a portion of their holdings at a rea
sonable figure for tho snko of the ben
efit it will be to the people of tho val
ley at large, nnd nlso with a view to
tho effect It will havo of increasing
the value of their other holdings which
it would undoubtedly do.
Another meeting to consider the
auestion has been called for next
Thursday night.

8,000 GARAGE
FOR JfflAR CITY
G. It. Parry & A. T. Jones Make
Sensational Announcement
of New Business.
INVESTMENT TO BE
BY DAVID BULLOCH
Architect Jones Now Working on the
Plans nnd Specifications for
Up-to-Datc Plant.
The announcement has just been
made by Messrs. G. R. Parry and A.
T. Jones of tho erection the present
season of another large garage in Ce
dar City, which is to cost approxi
mately $8,000, and will bo an orna
ment to Main street Tho new estab
lishment is to be erected for Messrs.
Parry & Jones by David Bulloch, on
his ground just across tho alley from
the old Palmer residence on the west
side of Main street, and will front on
both thorofares. It is to have n plate
glass front, heating plunt, and all
modern conveniences, providing gar
age for about 20 cars, besides the dis
play and work rooms, which will ac
commodate a number more cars.
Architect Jones has tho contract
for the plans nnd specifications, and
is already at work upon them. It is
the purpose to push tho construction
right along as rapidly as possible.
The promoters and lessees of the
garago announce their intention of
carrying a full line of tires, acces
sories, gasoline, oils and greaso, and
to conduct a strictly up-to-date gar
age, where car owners can obtain the
very most efficient service. They also
state that as soon' as tho garage is
ready they will handlo all their cars
for which thoy have tho agency in
co-partnership.-'-!-. - -- -
Mr.. Bulloch, whoJs furnishing the
investment for tho undertaking, is ono
of tho first pioneers of Cedar City.
Ho was the first white boy, ho states,
upon the present site of the town, and
is anxious to do his part towards tho
building up of the place. Ho has tho
ground and the money, and is willing
to combine them in a state of produc
tivity for a very reasonable return
upon his investment.
With two garages already operat
ing here, and with the announcement
that Agent Fife, backed by the Ford
company, will put up a $5,000 garage
and service station, it looks as if car
owners in this part of tho country
would be well cared for.
A NIGHT IN HAWAII
Tho Hawaiian Troubadors. who pre
sent their striking musical novelty,
"A Night in Hawaii," at tho Ward
Hall on Friday, May 19, havo not
misnamed their offering. Tho act was
arranged with tho object of present
ing to the public a correct idea of the
music, customs and dances of their
native land. Every member of tho com
pany is a thorough musician, and their
melodious voices blend perfectly with
tho soft tones of the string instru
ments in a sweet harmony so delight
ful to all music lovers.
Lauana, rightfully recognized as
Hawaii's daintest dancer, takes no
small part in tho program, and the
American and Hawaiian melodies,
both vocal and instrumental, ranging
from ragtime to grand opera and na
tive dancers in costume mako up a
program of pleasing variety.
Machinery for New Steam Laundry.
Mr. Gronway Parry informs us that
the machinery for the new steam
laundry is now on the way, and will
be hero very shortly. Everything will
be strictly new and first class. There
has been a little delay, Mr. Parry ex
plains, due to investigations which he
has been making of second-hand en
gines nnd boilers, but nothing wns
found that appealed to him, and now
all new equipment will be used. Defi
nite arrangements havo not been made
yet for a building, but Mr. Parry has
two or three available quarters in
sight, one of which will bo decided
upon by tho time the machinery ar
rives, if tho new building negotiated
for fails to materialize.
To Work Grand Canyon Property.
M. M. Millott returned last Wednes
day from tho Grand Canyon, where he
went in company with R. G. Pago of
Parowan to prospect further a copper
property in tho uottom of the gorge
spring by Mr. Millett and A. W.
Brouse. Millett brought back some
samples of high grade copper, and
states that it is his intention with
Messers. Brouso and Slaughtor to

Mr. Millett claims that tho oro car
ries values of $200 per ton in gold,
silver and copper, nnd that thoy can
get it carried out of tho gora for a,

' GARAGE BUSINESS SHOWS
REMARKABLE GROWTH.
Two years ago when J. A. Kopp
quit a good job in a California garago
to open a repair shop in Ccdnr City it
was a serious question with him and
Borne of his friends whether or not ho
was making a gravo mistake. And
during the first year It was more or
less closo picking, with not enough
work to keep one mnn employed stend
iV ,But during tnse early periods
Mr. Kopp was making a reputation for
his establishment which it has sinco
maintained, and the growth of his es
tablishment has been quite phenom
enal. Tho capacity of his garago has
been Increased three fold, and today
it Is employing anywhere from three
to six workmen. Mr. Kopp came to
Cedar just in the nick of time nnd got
in on the ground floor in n good bus
iness, which is certain to grow and
dovelop If his present nnd past poli
cy is adhered to, of doing good work
and chnrglng fair prices.
In addition to Mr. Kopp's garntre,
Mr. Don Coppln hns n garago in the
lower part of town, which employs
from ono to two or three men, all of
which goes to show tho rcmakable
growth of tho automobile industry in
this part of tho country.

Shall the Cow Be Given a Rest?
In all the largo well handled dairy
herds of America and among the good
herdsmen the question of "Shall the
cow bo given a rest?" is never consid
ered other than that she shall. The
idea that we have had in tho Western
country that when a cow is dry sho
needs very little to eat is wrong and
the sooner wo get away from this con
dition of practice, tho better off we
will become and tho greater production
wo vill get from our dairy cows. To
produce milk is iust as much a tax on
the system of the dairy cow as hard
work is on tho average draft horse,
and for that reason it requires consid
erable energy and nutriment to keep
up tho body. It has been proved be
yond question that cows when dry for
a month to six weeks are much better
producers than if milked up to within
two weeks or a few days of their
calving time. Tho only chance tho
hordsman has to get ahead of the cow
in feed is when Bho is not producing
milk regularly. At this time there is
a good opportunity to build up tho
body of tho animal, and if sho is any
thing like the right kind she immedi
ately returns tho stored up material
in her milk as soon as sho freshens.
Cows that are milked right up to calv
ing invariably will havo a normal calf
in every way, but the detriment comes
to tho mother rather than to tho calf.
Tho cow that is not given a rest before
calving has a milk flow that is at a
much lower level than the cow that is
given a rest, and sho never reaches tho
maximum production throughout tho
period that sho otherwise would. Sho
merely dwindles along giving half her
usual amount of milk and never reach
es the flow that she did In 'her other
lacation periods.
Base Ball Parowan vs. Cedar City.
The first local game of base ball of
tho season will be played next Satur
day nt 2:30 o'clock in tho ball park.
The Parowan "boys aro coming over
determined to wipe out tho defeat of
two weeks ago, so a game worth while
is assured.
Ten cents admission foe will bo
charged.
If tho citizens of Cedar City want
a base ball team, now is tho time to
boost.
