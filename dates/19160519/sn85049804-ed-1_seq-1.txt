Pays Loving Tribute to Mothers.
Mrs. Helena Downey of Ottumwa,
first president of the Iowa Federa
tion of Colored Women, spoke at the
Mothers' day exercises at St. Paul's
A. M. E. church last Sunday night to
a large and appreciative audience.
The subject of her address was
"Mother's Love."
"With ..the tender recollection of a
mother who long since passed into the
silent beyond and the memory of
precious home," said Mrs. Downey,
"I come to offer the tribute of a grate
ful heart. Two years ago the stork
visited Mother Columbia and brought
her a new holiday. The new comer
was christcned Mothers' Day. What
a beautiful and impressive tribute to
mother for a whole nation to unite on
one day in song, in speech and other
appropriate exercise to honor her, the
angel spirit of the home, the moulder
of human life. What could more fit
tingly represent motherhood than
white blossoms, the chosen emblem.
Its whiteness symbolizing purity, its
lasting qualities faithfulness, its
fragrance love, its wide field of
growth charity, and its form beauty.
This day should strengthen faith and
resolution, quicken action and stimu
late self-sacrififice."

NORTHWESTERN FEDERATION
MEET.
Among the many interesting wom
en's conventions which are in prepar
ation to oe held this year, one very
close at hand is that of the North
western Federation of Colored Wom
en's Clubs, which will convene at
Wichita, Kansas, June 7-9.
A knowledge of the program indi
cates that they will be a very busy
set of women and will accomplish
some very effective work for the ben
efit and advancement of the cause for
which they are organized. Among
the northwestern states interested are
Arizona, Colorado, Indiana, Iowa,
Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebras
ka, Ohio, Wisconsin, Wyoming and
Illiois. Meeting at the same time as
the national conventions in Chicago,
the meeting takes a peculiar import
ance and we are hoping for 3plendid
results. Mrs. J. Snowden-Porter of
Illinois is president and Mrs. J. B,
Rush of Iowa is secretary. Delegates
will send names and addresses to
Misa Stella Turner, 518 N. Water
street, Wichita, Kan., chairman of the
placing committee, and she will send
assignemnts. Entertainment free to
delegates.

THE MODERN SHORT DRESS IS
HARMFUL.
This new style short dress and high
fashionable shoe tops that the so
called society women wear nowadays
are very harmful, hurtful and dan
gerous to the morals of the Ameri
can girls. It seeks to create the
wrong impression. It is almost ob
scene and indecent to see our girls
out on the streets with those short
knee dresses. The sentiment that we
sow., now the next generation will
reap. Mothers, your girls will soon
lose all the modesty and womanly
graces by such exposures. Why real
ly some go on the streets with such
stunts in short dreeaes and other in
decent apparel that it shocks the
gallant manhbod of man to see them

what do they get out on the streets
and in public if not for men to see.
They are out to attract and be ad
mired by men. In reading this ar
ticle some will call me an old fogy,
but some day you will say that we all
ought to rise up and put a stop to
the vulgar and indecent dressing.
NEGROES IN SPELLING MATCH.
Dalton, Mo., May 1.—Several hun

ed the first country-wide spelling
match for Negro school children ever
held in Missouri, and whiih was a
part of the ninth annual commence

cultural and Industrial school.
Brunswick public school won first

raduated from the several service

Prince of St. Joseph delivered the
commencement address. He urged
all to prepare for more efficient serv

The exhibits of fine washing, iron

by the girls and the demonstrations
of plowing, harrowing, harnessing
and driving horses and mules and
caring for cows and hogs by the boys
were features of the commencement.

INDIANS
TO BE MADE INTO U.
s.
CITIZENS.
Washington, D. C., May 11.—The
United States will gain 186 new citi
zens Saturday, They are Sioux In
dians of Yankton, S. D.
Secretary Lane was on his way
there today as the persona! represen
tative of the "Great White Father"—
the president of the United States—
to conduct the ceremonies. Incident
ally he will present the Indians with
patents to their allotted lands.
The action will mark the first real
step in Secretary Lane's policy of
giving all competent Indians full con
trol of their individual affairs and
placing them upon the same legal
standing as all other American citi
zens.
He will then greet each Indian by
his "white" name and the ceremonies
will be ended.

Gertrude Braman.
The Bystander believes in good
government, because in good govern
ment only can all the people of all
races, classes, professions and call
ings enjoy equal rights and privileges
under the law. Good government is
not alone the result of good laws, but
is rather the result of the enforce
ment of those laws. That we may
have good laws properly enforced it
is necessary that we have at the head
of the department of justice a man
who is able to enforce them and is
guided by the spirit of justice to his
fellowmen in enforcing them.
It is necessary that we have a man
for attorney general who will enforce
the laws against the powerful inter
ests which are taking advantage of
the weak and helpless, instead of
using the law enforcement machinery
of the state exclusively to the search
ing out of the petty offenses of the
weak and ignorant and punishing
them. There is no man appearing
or attorney general who meets all of
these requirements as completely as
does H. M. Havner of Marengo.
Mr. Havner is recognized as the
greatest trial lawyer in the state, and
the state is entitled to the best legal
talent within its boundary to look
after the many interests of all the
people.
Mr. Havner was a classmate in the
Iowa university of our steemed S.
Joe Brown, who speaks of Mr. Hav
ner with the highest praise for hist
ability as a lawyer, his kindness as
a classmate and his behavior as a
gentleman. On account of this class

JAS.
R. HANNA FOR LIEUTEN
ANT GOVERNOR.
Mayor Jas. R. Hanna is going to
win the nomination for lieutenant
governor. Of that there is not the
shadow of a doubt. He is a local
man and the colored vote here that
knows what he has done for this city
ought to be for him, and will be. Tlie
colored vote out over the state not so
well acquainted with him and with
his work we want to reach and say to.
them to vote for Jas. R. Hanna for
lieutenant governor. He is reliable.
You always know just where to find
him. He is «an upright, honorable
gentleman worthy of the vote of
every man. He has been tried and
found not wanting. The young man
and the young woman can find an in
spiration in his life. Since he was
twelve* years old he has fought his
own way forward, helping himself
through school and college and al
ways helping others.
He has a sympathy with the com
mon people that is not often found
in public men. His friends should
show him their appreciation by going
to the polls en masse and voting for
him on June 5th, primary day.
Mr. Thomas is still in the campaign
for state treasurer and from the re
ports that are coming in daily we feel
almost assured of his nomination. His
appeal to the voters through his leg
islative record, together with the en-«
dorsement of labor, merit the undi
vided support of the wa'ge earner in
his campaign.

important at this time is the selec
