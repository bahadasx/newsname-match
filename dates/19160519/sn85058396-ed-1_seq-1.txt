cently engaged in a fight with five
German aeroplanes brought down his

penetrate a small salient of our line
at a point near St. Hubert. This at-
"i tempt was made after the explosion

German Attack Extremely Violent.
I "On the left bank of the Meuse yes-
') terady evening German forces renew-
c, ed their attack in the vicinity of Avo-
f court wood and Hill 304. These at-
,, tacks were of extreme violence. In

- men belonging to two divisions recent-
;' ly arrived on the field. The. enemy
r' found It Impossible to dislodge us

' less on the center the enemy were
, able to occupy a small work south of

"Yesterday we captured more than
900 Italians, among whom were 12
officers and took IS cannon and ma
chine guns.

"The official Italian reports of May
16 and 17 state that the Austro-Hun-garian
losses in these engagements
uere enormous. These reports were
invented in order to diminish the im
pression made by the Italian retreat.
The losses of the enemy can be esti
mated only by those who hold the
battlefield. The Italians are not in
that position The Austro-Hungarl-ans,
while appreciating at its full val
ue the sacrifice of every brae sol
dier, are able to declare that the Aus-tro-Hungarian
losses have been ex
ceedingly small, thanks to the ability
of the infantry, the powerful protec
tion given by the artillery and the
experience in war of the command
ers!" For example there fell Into the
hands of the Austrians on Folgarla
plateau an order issued by an Italian
dlviison commander In which the pla
teau was characterized as a position
of fundamental importance to be held
at all hazards.

Dally Progress Made.
Berlin, May 18, -via London, May 19,
12-12 p m. The Austrian offensive
south and southeast of Rovereto is
making progress daily. The Austrian
front already has been advanced 'five
miles in places.
These gains have been made in the
face of great difficulties. The moun
tains are still covered with snow. The
Austrians fought their way ascending
and descending slopes varying In alti
tude as much as 4,000 feet within a
mile. Dispatches from Austrian head
quarters indicate the successes achiev
ed are due to the superiority of the
artillery, which has such a crushing
effect that it is possible to launch In
fantry attacks after comparatively
short preparation.
Captures of men and war materials
are increasing daily. The number of
prisoners now exceeds 7,300. The
Austrians also have taken 31 cannqn
and 35 machine guns.
The positions captured have been
In the hands of the Italians for
months. They include points to which

BIRRELL TALKS
ON SINN FEINISM
Former Chief Secretary of Ire
land Is Witness Before Brit
ish Royal Commission.
HOME RULE BILL
Great Explosion of Rage and
Disappointment Due If Irish
Measure Was Not
Adopted.
London, May 19, 11 31 a m Au
gustine Birrell, who resigned as chief
secretary for Ireland after the Sinn
Fein revolution, appeared today as a
witness before the Royal commission
wliigh Is conducting an inquiry into
the Irish rebellion. Mr. Birrell stated
that he had read Sir Matthew Na
than's statement of yesterday that
the government had advance infor
mation of the Irish rebellion and that
he did not know that there were any
additions he wished to make. He
then read a statement which he de
scribed as dealing with Sinn Felnism.
Mr. Birrell continued
"If the home rule bill -had not
been placed on the statute books
there would have been a great ex
plosion of rage and disappointment,
both In Ireland and In the United
States, which, when war came would
have assumed alarming proportions.
The events in Ulster and the gun
running at Larne by the Ulsterites in
1914 undoubtedly had a great effect
on disloyalists elsewhere.
"Ireland had preserved an unbrok
en front at the outbreak of the war,
through the patriotism of John Red
mond, Mr. "Birrell continued, "but
there were many "vvho did not agree
with his attitude. It was impossible
to overestimate the effect which the
advent of the Ulster leader, Sir Ed
ward Carson, to the cabinet, had ex
ercised upon the minds of the people
of Ireland. If Mr. Redmond had ac
cepted office in the same cabinet he
would not have remained leader of
tho Irish party.
When It was seen that the war
would be prolonged, Mr. Birrell said,
Ireland soon developed not wholly
unreasonable expectations of a Ger
man landing and of partial risings in
different parts of Ireland; and prom
ises of German assistance were at tho
bottom of the outbreak.
Sinn Feinlsm Spreads.
Answering Baron Harding, Mr. Bir
rell said:
"Sinn Feinlsm had spread all over
the place. The Sinn Felners were
sick of parliamentary parties and
they desired to be left alone. I real
ized for two years that certainly
there was a dangerous movement In
Ireland, but after consultation with
the various Irish leaders I came to
the conclusion that a policy of non
intervention was tho safest. To dis
arm any one section of the popula
tion on tre evidence we had would
have been dangerous."
Baron Hardinge: "You need not an
swe rthis question but why were the
Irish leaders who advised you in this
policy to bo relied upon?"
Saw Danger aHead.
Mr. Birrell: "In the first place I
had formed a pretty clear estimate
of my own and I don't think I ever
was much influenced by ohter peo
ple. But Mr. Redmond for example,
always took the view that tho Sinn
Feiners were negligible, and he said
so in the house of commons. I did
not attach much importance to his
opinion because I was quite sure they
.svero dangerous."
Continuing, Mr. Birrell said he had
daily reports from the Royal Irish
constabulary and these reports were
of such a character that ono could
form a general estimate of tbe state
of feeling in tho countryside.
Felt Nervous Over Condition.
"I always felt that I was very ig
norant of what was going on in the
cellars of Dublin and I was exceeding
ly nervous about that. .1 had heard
that the castle was to be taken.
"Steps wore taken to deal with
these reports but nothing came of
them, and I should bo very curious to
'hear if anybody knew this thing was
going to happen.
"I had very decided views. So
much so that I had conferences with
Generals Kitchener and French on
March 20 and March 27 to persuade
them to send more soldiers to Dub
lin." nn

ness and a Protective Tar
iff Being Considered.
OLD GUARD FOR ROOT
Progressive Party Planning
Convention Work Many
Delegations to Vote'
For Roosevelt.
Chicago, May 19. Preparation of
the Republican plntform which will be
submitted to the national convention
next month had statted, according to
Fred W. Upham, chairman of the local
committee on arrangements for the
convention, who returned from New
York today after a conference with
Chairman Hilles and other members
of the Republican national committee.
Strong planks favoring American
Ism, military preparedness and a tariff
for the protection of American indus
tries, it Is said, are among subjects be
ing considered. The plank on Ameri
canism and military preparedness
will, it is declared, be sufficiently
strong to meet every reasonable de
mand of Progressive Republicans, ac
cording to reports received here.
Old Guard For Root.
"I talked with nearly all the 'old
guard' leaders In the east and left
New York convinced that Ellhu Root
Is tho most favored candidate for
president in tho Atlantic states," said
Mr. Upham. "IIo will have a majority
of the delegates from New York and
the other eastern states on the early
ballots, but the leaders aro still figur
ing and have not decided whether
they will be able to nominate him. If
Root is not nominated I think a west
ern man will bo chosen.
"One of the most prominent mem
bers of tho 'old guard' told me that
he felt certain that Roosevelt would
not receive more than eighty votes on
the first ballot. I think Hughes best
chance will bo as a compromise can
didate in the event the convention
runs more than five days."
Nominating speeches for presiden
tial candidates may be limited to ten
minutes each, and seconding speech
es to five minutes for each candidate,
acordlng to present plans.
Mr. Upham aaid the local committee
had received more than 60,000 appli
cations for convention tickets.
Tickets for the convention are bring
ing from $50 to $250 each.
Progressive Party Plans.
O. K. Davis, secretary of the Pro
gressive party national committee as
sumed charge today of tho plans for
the party national convention to be
held at the Auditorium June 7.
"Our principal difficulty thus far
is to find seats for those who want
to attend our convention," said Sec
retary Davis. "Most of the states
have elected double or triple delega
tions while several have chosen four
times the number of delegates fixed
by the official call."
"Is Colonel Roosevelt coming to Chi
cago for the convention," he was ask
ed. "Not that I know of," said Secretary
Davis.
F. P. Corrick, Progressive state
chairman of Nebraska, said ho had in
formation that tho entire delegation of
fourteen from Washington and at
least six of the eight delegates from
South Dakota to the Republican na
tional convention would vote for Col
onel Roosevelt for president on the
first ballot. I
