SENIORS ENTERTAINED
Tho faculty of the St. Helens high

day evening, ut tho Orcadla hotel,
wltira dinner. Tho color scheme was
pink and white, and It was carried
out III every detail throughout the
dinner. Hand painted place cards
nnrked each guest's place. L. L.

Tho seniors responded to the
following toasts: "Grindstone," Ket
urah Dixon; "Cobblestone," Lois

"Tombstone," Raymond Delivers;

remarks by each one of tho faculty.
Tho following were present besides
tho seniors: Mr. and Mrs. L. L.
Maker; Miss Helens Duns, V. J. Sten
and C. E. Ostrander.
Pocullur and mysterious conditions
have combined to make the clam lu
diuitry for tho latter part of 1916
and up to the present tlmo of this
year, a rank failure. Usually the
Fall und Spring seasons yield large
quantities of luscious, bivalves; this
season, however, clams have been so
imiall that they , have proved of no
commercial value and Clatsop Beach
canneries havo not been receiving
enough to Justify running the plant.
In tho past few months, the sea has
been jinusuully rough, and It Is pre
sumed by export clam diggers that
tho bivalves have moved further out,
on tho continental shelf. Again some
have concluded that these conditions
affect the local beds only.,
