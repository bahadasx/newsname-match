WAGONER HELD
JOR ASSAULT
Attempted to Murder One of
His Neighbors
Moscow, May 16.—Charles Wago
ner, who made an unsuccessful
attempt yesterday to murder W. H.
Duff and whose plans also provided
for killing Charles Graves, is held
in the county jail here and yvill face
a charge of assult with intent to
commit murder. Wagoner's act
was perpetrated under circum
stances that would indicate he had
become temporarily insane, the re
sult of brooding over trouble of
several years' standing concerning a
road controversy. Duff was badly
injured as the result of the beating
he received, but advices received
by Sheriff Campbell this evening
would'indicate the man will recover.
Facts learned by Sheriff Campbell
show that Wagoner went to the
home of Duff at 4 o'clock yesterday
morning and carried with him a
.44-caliber Colt's revolver. He shot
three times at Duff with the revol
ver and missed. He then took a
.22 rifle owned by Duff and en
deavored to use this but could not
make the weapon work. He then
beat Duff over the head with the
revolver. Duff is seventy-three
years old, while Wagoner is fifty
three, and the older man was power
less to effectively resist. Wagoner,
finding that the beating had not
killed Duff, forced the latter to
accompany him to the Wagoner
home a mile or so distant. Here
Wagoner got a 30-30 rifle and then
went to his barn and corrals where
he kissed his horses and cattle good
bye, offering them endearing terms.
He then forced Duff, who was weak
from loss of blood, the result of
the beating, to march down the
road toward the Charles Grove's
place about one and one-half miles
distant, it being the purpose ap
oarently of Wagoner to kill both
Duff and Graves and then himself
After traveling about half the dis
tance to the Graves place, Wagoner
engaged Duff in conversation and
the latter accepted a chance for his
life by bolting into a run. Wagon
er fired three shots at the fleeing
man at close range • but missed.
However, he believed that he had
killed Duff and returned to his
cabin. Duff succeeded in reaching
the Graves home when the authori
ties were notified.
Sheriff Campbell found Wagoner
in his cabin and the man was in a
frenzied state. After the sheriff
gained admittance to the building,
Wagoner made a move toward his
rifle, but the sheriff stepped in
front of him. Later when the
sheriff explained that Duff had not
^ueen killed, Wagoner appeared more
rational and accompanied the sheriff
without resistance.
The road trouble involved devel
oped several years ago when a road
was forced through Wagoner's land.
Duff was road overseer at that time.
Wagoner has retained Attorney
G. W. Suppiger to defend him.

Hill pitched the game for Ken
drick, struck out 19 men and al

made on a series of errors. The
local team has finally decided that
a little practice might improve

TO ELIMINATE
POWELL GRADE
Approximate Cost Would be
$1300
The following letter will no doubt
be of interest to many readers of
the Gazette. To the board of Coun
ty Commissioners of Latah County:
We the undersigned made two pre
liminary surveys of the change of
Powell grade between Kendrick and
Juliaetta.
The first survey utilizing a part of
the present grade, calls for a maxi
mum grade of 6 per cent, the total
length of change being 3850 feet.
Practically all of the excavation is
dirt and loose rock. Assuming that
a roadway 14 feet in width will be
built we estimate that the cost of
construction will be about $1300.
The second survey calls for a
maximum grade of 4.6 per cent
with a total length of change of
3350 feet. Part of the excavation
is loose rock and dirt and a small
part solid rock. Assuming that a
roadway 14 feet in width will be
built and figuring on a 12 foot cut
18 feet in width at top of grade we
estimate the cost of construction
will be about $1300.
In arriving at above figures we
assume that an experienced and
efficient superintendent will be put
in charge of construction and 10
hours will be considered a day. In
these preliminary surveys we are
unable to determine the exact
amount of dirt and loose rock that
will be handled nor the exact
amount of solid rock that will be
encountered but we believe that
$1300 is a fair estimate of probable
cost of either route.
Respectfully submitted,
N. A. Nelson,
Overseer Road Dist. No. 10.
H. J. Smith,
County Surveyor.
County Commissioner John L.
Woody expressed the belief that if
Kendrick and Juliaetta would get
a
Kendrick and Juliaetta would get
together and put this project
through, the county would contri
bute liberally toward defraying the
expense. Many of the business men
of Kendrick are anxious to have
this road improvement made and
will do their part toward meeting
the expense.

THE FLYING SQUADRON
The "Suffragette Special" Stopped at Our Capital City and
Gave Program in the Evening |
To the Editor of the Gazette.
As your special correspondent
from the State Capital I desire to
say that the "Suffragist Special"
has come and gone. To appreciate
this wonderful movement one must
come into actual contact with its
leaders. It is not necessary to add
that the ladies making up the "Fly
ing Squadron" were specialists in
their line—that is understood in
advance.
That they received rather a cool
reception in Boise will be readily
admitted by all except bonafide
residents of the Capital City. The
special arrived on time. The Mayor
of the city whose duty it was to
welcome the ladies was on hand but
looked and felt lonesome. How
ever he performed his part hero
ically even if he was glad when it
was over. In the evening the
theatre was well filled but it was
by no means a "capacity audience."
The program was carried out to
the minutest detail. The blare of
trumpets was lacking but the women
who were good to look at as well
as eloquent in speech, were not a
disappointment.
Those who believe in women suf
frage, and we all do, were delight
ed not only with the arguments pre
sented but with their splendid de
livery. It was a pleasant evening
delightfully and profitably spent.
The speakers were not a lot of
blatant suffragettes, but refined and
educated women who knew their
rights and were at all times ready
to maintain them.
It may be considered a lack of
political wisdom to criticise Senator
Borah not only in his own state but
more especially in his own town,
but Mrs. Harriet Stanton Blatch,
the daughter of Mrs. Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, the poineer suffragist,
was equal to the occasion. This
magnificent woman figuratively
flayed Idaho's illustrious senator.
The following is but
what she said:
"Senator Borah argues that as
the Fifteenth amendment has not
been enforced for the colored man,
a federal amendment for women's
suffrage would be but a fraud on
the negro women. The answer is
obvious: If Senator Borah thinks
the amendments his party passed
are not enforced and yet ought to
be, why has he not fought steadily
ever since he has been in the senate
for the accomplishment of his be
liefs? Why does he seek to ease
his conscience by penalizing women
politically?"
From Senator Borah Mrs. Blatch
appealed to the women of Idaho in
a very effective manner. This lady
was the star speaker of the aggre
sample of I
Miss Redfield a Candidate |
On May 4, I announced my can
didacy for the nomination for the J
office of State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, subject to the
wishes of the Republican electors
of
Sep
^State at the Primaries,

" r " In announcing my candidacy, I
take the position of heartily endors
ing resolutions recently adopted by
the State Board of Education, favor
ing a constitutional amendment for
the abolishment of the office, thus
eliminating duplication in the State
Department of Education.
If elected, I shall do what is in
my power toward perfecting the
organization of the unified plan of
administration for the school system
of the State, as well as to perform
the duties of the office to the best
of my ability.
ETHEL E. REDFIELD.
gation yet it was readily admitted
that Miss Todd of California made
the hit of the evening.
The Governor was out of the
city but he hurried home some
time during the night to welcome
the Suffragists under the Capital
dome on the following day. This
was a red letter day for the Gov
ernor who had declared a suspension
of business in the Capital building
from ten to twelve o'clock. Miss
Mabel Vernon of New Jersey acted
as master of ceremonies. Our dis
tinguished governor has been intro
duced many times to larger
audiences but never in a more fit
ting and complimentary manner and
by so fine looking a woman. The
introduction seemed to put the gov
ernor on his metal and he at once
waded into his sublect. Judicious
applause (by the suffragists) urged
him to his best effort. When the
governor got through there was
little left of Idaho. He had given
it all to these ladies. His central
thought was this—If you don't see
what you want ask for it. He was
even more generous than King
Ahasuerus of ancient fame who pro
mised Queen Esther the half of his
kingdom. Our good governor didn't
deal in halves of anything. After
exhausting his subject he stepped
aside and admired himself from
head to foot while waiting for the
generous applause to subside.
As soon as quiet was restored
this omnipresent New Jersey girl
announced that Mrs. Blatch would
return thanks for the generous wel
come. Mrs. Blatch stood immedi
ately in front of the governor and
her first sentence was this: "Now
Governor Alexander, I want to talk
personally to you a minute or two,
as one Democrat to another Demo
crat." And in her soft pleading
accents it took her but a few min
utes to show that our Moses, our
own Governor, was but a bag of
I wind. Of course she did not use
such vulgar words for she was a
lady. Promises aud flattery were
lady. Promises aud flattery were
not what the Flying Squadron were
seeking but action—do it now.
After this eloquent plea for action
the governor remained silent be
cause he hadn't anything more to
say.
The dignitaries of the State house,
including the supreme court, lined
up and graciously greeted the
Suffragists as they passed down the
line. The northern third of the
supreme court does not look like a
dignified judge, but it would be a
reckless fellow that would bet how
far a toad could jump by looking at
him. The visitors left on the noon
train sighing for more Governors to
conquer.

BIG BEAR RIBGE
BOOSTERS' PICNIC
At Steel School House Grove
June 7
A big picnic will be held at the
Steel School House grove on Big
Bear ridge Wednesday, June 7. It
is to be given by the Booster's
Club of Big Bear ridge and every
one is not only invited, but urged to
be present and help to make this
a great success.
The plan is for everyone to meet
at the Steel School house at 10
o'clock Wednesday morning and
march to the picnic ground, the
procession to be headed by the Ken
drick band. An address of wel
come will be given by the president
of the club and at 11:00 o'clock
Professor A. E. Wade will address
the crowd. At noon the big eats
will be held and everyone is re
quested to bring well filled lunch
baskets so there will be no hungry
people present. Free coffee will be
furnished to everybody.
At 1:00 o'clock there will be an
address delivered by Frank L.
Moore. After the address a base
ball game and other sports will be
held.
The object of this picnic is to
have a general get-together meet
ing to make new acquaintances and
renew old acquaintances. The
towns in the surrounding country
hold their fairs and celebrations
but the idea of the farmers getting
together for a general good time
for everyone is a new idea and one
that deserves commendation and
support.
Council Decides on Lights
At a special meeting of the city
council on Wednesday evening,
negotiations for the lighting of the
streets were completed and the light
company will begin the installation
of the lights at once. The contract
between the city and the Potlatch
Electric Company calls for approxi
mately two thousand candlepower
which has been distributed about
the town by the council in such a
manner as to light each intersection
and dark corner most efficiently.
The town agrees to pay $50.00 per
month for two thousand watts of
current, the light company to install
the distribution wires and lamp
sockets and the town to buy and
maintain the lamp globes.
The light will be distributed as
follows: A two hundred watt light
at the following corners—Lewis
Garage, Post Office, Fraternal
Temple and Red Cross Drug Store.
A hundred watt at the creamery and
another at the street intersection
near the county bridge leading to
Sperry grade. A sixty watt at the
corner leading to the school-house
hill and one each at the Presbyter
ian and Methodist churches. Five
twenty watt and two forty watt in
the band stand and three forty watt
in the city hall. A forty watt at
the head of the steps leading from
the N. P. tracks near the steel
bridge crossing Bear creek. The
remaining twelve forty watt lamps
will be placed at the intersection of
streets not provided for in the above
arrangement.
The entire lighting system will
total thirty-two lamps which will
distribute the light in good shape
over the town.

IDAHO STATE
MILITIA READY
12 Companies and Hospital
Detachments
Boise Statesman: Should Presi
dent Wilson find it necessary to call
the Idaho national guard to the
colors, he would receive a prompt
and helpful response. In few if in
any states is the guard better pre
pared for active service. In propor
tion to its population Idaho stands
first in preparedness. It is one of
only five or six states in the Union
in which the national guard member
ship is above the minimum of 867
men.
The Idaho national guard consists
of 12 companies and hospital detach
ments. In the ranks are 900 health
ly, loyal young men, well drilled,
skilled in markmanship, capable of
taking care of themselves under all
conditions. There are 56 officers
who have demonstrated their fitness
to command. The equipment has
been closely inspected and is in per
fect condition. The heavy tentage
is kept in Boise, where it is avail
able on a moment's notice. Other
wise, each company has its own
equipment. Every company has
recently passed inspection and all
have been pronounced fit in every
particular.
During the past year 747 guards
men fired the full target course,
taking high rank in marksmanship.
The war strength of a national
guard regiment is 1836 officers and
men, with a medical corps of 24.
The Idaho regiment could easily be
brought up to war strength should
the necessity arise. In the state are
many ex-regulars, ex-volunteersand
ex-guardsmen who would make
splendid recruits. In Boise alone,
it is estimated, there are about 75
former cavalrymen, physically fit,
whose services would be available
in emergency. Of veterans of the
Spanish-American war, who would
not hesitate if their country called
them again, there are a large num
ber in Idaho who have shown their
military ability in a way that will
long be remembered.
Ordinarily a state regiment re
quires about three months' prepara
tion for the field. The Idaho na
tional guard could, in the opinion
of competent judges, be mobilized
in as many weeks should its services
be needed in a hurry. That is, pro
vided war strength is not demanded.
The equipment available would pro
vide for 1000 men. Additional
equipment could be obtained in
about 10 days.
Idaho has the guard organization
and the spirit, and stands ready to
answer the nation's call at any mo
ment. The companies comprising
the Idaho national guard are:
A, Sandpoint; B. Nampa; C,
Coeur d'Alene; D, Twin Falls; E,
Grangeville; F, Lewiston; G. Cald
well; H, Boise; I, Payette; K, Buhl;
L, Weiser; M, Emmett.
"And don't forget that we have
one of the best military bands in
the country," remarked a guard
officer, "Idaho is right up to the
minute in every respect. Just give
us the word and see."
Mrs. H. P. Hull, while attending
a meeting of the Ladies Study Club,
became quite ill and had to be taken
to her home in a car. She is feel

Mrs. J. Bailey was a guest at the
McKeever home on Little Bear
