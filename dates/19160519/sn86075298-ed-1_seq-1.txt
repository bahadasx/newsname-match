ONAN WINS AME
IN FIRST INNING
V The Camas-Ronan game last Sundayv
was won in the first inning by the Ro
nan boys clouting the ball for steen
safe hits and by errors made by the in
experienced Camas players. After
that, while the game was interesting,
0 it was much better played.

r- White repeated the performance on the
ft next one. Then each and every man
as he came up batted safe until eight
scores were chalked up for the home
team. It became a foot race, a swat
fest and a merry-go-round all in one.
The crowd hollered for the boys to let
up and not make the game a farce and
ig finally three batters were out and the
ly side retired. It was goose eggs for
Camas every inning thereafter except
e' one, when they scored two, Joe White

after runners were on bases. f
Camas changed pitchers after four n
innings and it was a better game after a
that, but never in danger. The final t
score was Ronan 13, Camas 2.
It must not be thought that the
Camas players are not good ball
layers, judging by the score. Their
misfortune occurred all in one inning
and if it had not been for that one
frame the game would have been close
and exciting. Some of the Camas
players are seasoned veterans and with
a little practice they are going to be a
hard proposition to beat. As it was,
they had ridden in automobiles from
Camas that morning and went on the
field cold and before they realized what
had happened were beaten beyond hope.
A good crowd attended the game and
the gate receipts were in excess of $50.
Another game will be played on the
Ronan grounds next Sunday between
Ronan and Somers. The latter team
has signified their intention of bringing
their band and a lot of rooters and are
after revenge for the defeat adminis
tered them at Somers Sunday before
last. It will be a game worth going to
see and every fan should be on hand.
The batteries last Sunday at the
start were Taylor and Taylor for
Camas, with Gregg substituted later;
r for Ronan, White and Turnquist, with
Benny Hull going into the box for a
final inning.

a couple of weeks in Missoula.
IS N. P. RAILROAD BEING
HELD UP BY GOVERNMENT?,
Last Friday Stanley Scearce
sent the following telegram to
President J. H. Hannaford of
i the Northern Pacific railroad:
"Congress today voted $750,
t 000 for year's reclamation work
tributary to Ronan. Less money
would build railroad to Ronan.
Increased acreage of grain here
looks above average. Would be
pleased to make some definite
L announcement from you."
On Saturday Mr. Scearce fol
lowed up the first telegram with
p another, reading:
n "Henry H. Rolapp, president
e of United States Sugar Manu
,_ facturers' Association, Salt Lake,
a and Wm. Leslie Lawson, man
it ager Billings Sugar Co., here to
1 day accompanied by Senator Jos.
M. Dixon. These gentlemen
I authorize me to quote them as
y saying if Flathead railroad is
built they will build a sugar fac
tory at some convenient point in
11 western Montana."
11 Not hearing anything from
is Mr. Hannaford, on Monday the
15th, Mr. Scearce got the wires
busy again and sent a third tele
* gram which read:
"Approximately 22 miles of
easy grading would connect Ro
nan with main line near Dixon
and serve satisfactorily reser
vation tonnage. In view of de
velopments here may I suggest
the expediency of early an
nouncement as indicated?"
Either Mr. Hannaford was un
able to answer the first two tele
grams right off the bat or else
thought if he didn't answer
en pretty soon he might get more
n- of the same nature. At any rate
or on Tuesday, the 15th, the follow
' ing telegram was received:
at "St. Paul, May 16, 1916.

RURAL FREE DELI?
ERY IS SECURED
Rural free delivery can be secured
for that section of territory northeast, s
north, northwest and west of Ronan at
an early date, provided the patrons of d
the route will establish the mail boxes t
for the deposit of their mail, along- 2
side the road.
An inspector from the post office de
partment was in Ronan this week and
has officially announced that the route
will not be put into operation until the
83 boxes are in place, but that the
route would not be established until
they are. The boxes are now at the
post office ready for the patrons to take
them out and put in place, so it would I
seem that those who are to receive
their mail through this service should
come in and get their boxes. The cost
of the boxes, lock. etc., will be $1.35,
which is actual cost, the government
insisting that no profit be made by any
one distributing the boxes.
The Pioneer hopes that the patrons
of the route will get busy and erect the
boxes, that the route may be estab
lished and mail delivered at an early
date. The delivery for the present will
be three times each week and the ac
commodation to those living at a dis
tance from the post office should be
a sufficient to warrant some haste in the
r matter of putting up the boxes.

able us to commence work this S
year. Certainly expect to build h
the line and give proper service
as rapidly as reclamation pro- c
jects develop.
"J. H. Hannaford."
There is considerable satis
faction to be derived from this
telegram from President Hanna
3 ford, and there is also a lot of
3 non-committal assurance. Just
what is meant by the wording
- wherein he states that the sur- I
1 vey work is "being done under i
authority of the department.
t Hope to secure additional author
- ity that will enable us to build
this year," is the puzzler. The
question naturally arises to a
great many of us, is the govern
a mert holding up the building of
s the Dixon extension? If there
s are conditions which the govern
a ment is exacting of the Northern
Pacific before allowing the road
a to be built, what are they and
e what should cause the delay?
s Heretofore it has always been
- the answer when the Northern
Pacific was importuned to build,
f that they could not sell the bonds
to raise the money. Now it
n seems that another excuse is be
ing given, and neither one satis
t fies the people here who are at
1- the mercy of that corporation for
transportation facilities.
- rhis should satisfy every per
son on the Flathead and in Mis
iC soula also that a united effort
3r' should now be made to finance
e the electric line from Missoula
to to Poison. We are being misled
now by a surveying party being
sent here at a time when agi
tation for transportation was at
the heighth of effort, in hopes
is that by running a few more sur
i- veys and the use of a whole lot
to of "bull" that those who are
working for the electric line
would simply quit. If there was
e ever a time for energetic action
i- by all concerned, it is now.
DISTRICT NO. 28

Ekalaka Wants Railroad
The town of Ekalaka in Fallon coun
ty, the most southeasterly county in
Montana, wants a railroad. To further
show their intentions in the matter a
company has been organized and ar
ticles of incorporation have been filed
with the secretary of state to build the
road.
Ronan, PoIson, St. Ignatius and Mis
soula wants the electric line built from
the lake to Missoula and a committee
has been appointed to incorporate a
company to build that line, but no in
corporation papers have at last ac
counts been filed.
Why this procrastination?
MISSOULA STAMPEDE AT
TRACTING MUCH ATTENTION
The best entertainment Western
Montana has ever witnessed is prom
ised in the Missoula Stampede which
will be held this year on July 1, 2, 3
and 4. Word has been received from
the best talent in the United States
and it is a certainty that the compe
tition at the Stampede this year will
be keen. There will be stars in every
line of wild west endeavor. With the
announcement by "Buffalo" Vernon
that he will be here to enter the bull
dogging lists the management of the
Stampede feels highly elated. Vernon
undoubtedly has the best reputation in
the world in the bull-dogging line. He
has won many championships and his
announcement makes it certain that
there will be one of the best in the
world entered in every different event
listed on the program.
Ruth Parton, "Tex" McLeod, Lee
Caldwell and practically all of the ones
who entered in last year's events have
signified their intention of competing
and there is now no doubt as to the
class of the contestants who will strive
for the increased prizes which have
been offered by the management.
There will be entertainment offered
morning, noon and night. One of the
features last year was a three-para
chute-drop baloon ascension. This year
the committee is striving to close with
a baloonist, who will guarantee four or
more drops. In addition there will be
L other high class attractions which will
I be announced from time to time. Rifle
teams from' Spokane and Butte will
enter in the annual tournament, which
will be held in Missoula this year as
last. The entertainment offered will
b be of the highest order throughout.
SHOULD STAY WNITH THE
INSTRUCTIONS OF VOTERS
A number of state papers are en
deavoring to find a way for the Mon
tana republican delegates to break
away from the instructions given them
by the presidential preference primary,
Such an attempt at this time should be
frowned upon by all voters and the
delegates will only have done their duty
to themselves and those who sent them
when they strictly adhere to the in
structions.
The papers endeavoring most earn
- estly to find an excuse are making use
S of the argumefit that only Seantor
a Cummins' name was on the ticket and
- that a number of candidates did not
- allow their names to be voted on. That
a is not a valid reason, as each and every
candidate had the same opportunity as
- Senator Cummins did to have their
names appear on the official ballot. To
disregard the instructions now will cast
odium on the preferential primary and
. as much could then be said about the
delegates being under the influence of
the politicians as was heretofore said
about the old convention methods.
Then too, those republicans who at
e tended the primary and voted for Sen
ator Cummins have every right to ex
t; pect the delegates to stand by the in
1. structions, just as those who did not
personally favor the senator would have
the right to do had their candidate
been the choice of a majority of the
Montana repic1 icans. Simply because
their man was not the choice as ex
h- pressed at the polls is no good reason
8, why the instructions should be dis
regarded.

ASQUITH'S VISIT
MAY BE FAILURE
Belfast, May 16.-Stubborn disin
zlination to accept anything in the
way of a government which might im
ply the future subjection of Ulster to
home rule was evident on Premier As
quith's visit to Belfast, which lasted
only a few hours. So far as can be
learned the premier's conference with
a large body of representative Ulster
men was disappointing.
It is understood the question of the
general disarmament of forces in Ire
land not authorized by the govern
ment was discussed and, although at
tendants were pledged to secrecy, it
is rumored cold water was thrown on
the proposal.
