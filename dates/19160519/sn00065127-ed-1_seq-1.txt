Separator Speed Determines Rich
ness of Cream
As much as 50 per cent variation In
the richness of cream may be obtained
by variation in speed of operating the
separator. If normal speed Is 5,'» turns
of the crank .per minute, 75 turns will
bring rich cream and 25 turns will
bring thin cream. A great deal of fat
is lost In the skim milk when low
speed Is used. Sometimes nearly one
half of the fat may be found in the
skim milk when the separator has
been run too slowly. This demon
strates the fact that there is only one
speed for economical operation of the
separator, and that Is the right speed.
This speed is indicated on the crank
handle.—By Prof. C. Larsen, State
College.
Electricity Masters The Mountain
Barriers
One of the most stupendous prob
lems of western railroading has been
the mountains. To lift the tremen
dous tonnage of the transcontinental
trains over the mlle-tn-the-alr crest of
the mountains Is a Herculean task un
der the most favorable conditions, and
when snow tills the passes, and cold
beleaguers the tire boxes of the steam
locomotive, the difficulties of moun
tain operation become well-nigh in
superable.
Remarkable, therefore, was the re
cent record of one of the "Milwau
kee's" new Electric Locomotives,
pulling the all-steel "Olympian" over
the Rockies- receiving the train at
Deer Lodge, Montana, forty-live
minutes late, and having to traverse
the mile high pass of the Great
Continental Divide in the dead of
winter, it made up the lost time in
the run of 115 miles and arrived at
Three Forks, Montana, on scheduled
time.
This astounding record shows that
