Atlantic City, N. J., May 19.—By the
adoption of a recommendation. today
the one hundred twenty-eighth gen

immediate direction of the church in

national lay board.
The plan, when carried to its con
clusion, will make evangelists salaried
members of an evangelistic committee
of all the churches.
The evangelists will be assigned to
districts that need therb. This will
elimlnate"the much criticized thank
offerings at the-end of the revivals.
The evangelistic merger 1B provided

Chicago, May 19.—Preparation of
the republican platform which will be
submitted to the national convention
next month has been storied, accord
ing to Fred D.. Upham, chairman of
the local committee on arrangements,
who returned from New York today
after a conference with Chairman
Hilles and other members of the na
tional committee
Strong planks favoring American
ism, preparedness and protection for
American industries, it is said, are
being considered* The planks on
Americanism and military prepared
ness, it is said, will be sufficiently
strong to meet every demand of pro
gressive republicans.
"I have talked with nearly all the
'old guard' leaders in the east, and
left New York convinced that Ellhu
Root is the most favored candidate
for the presidency in the Atlantic
states," said Mr Upham. "He will have
a majorlty-of the delegates from New
York and other eastern states on the
early ballots, but the leaders are still
figuring whether they will be able to
nominate him. ,,
"If Root is not nominated I think a
western man will be chosen.
"One of the most prominent of the
'old guard' told me he felt certain that
Roosevelt would not receive more
than eighty vttes on the first ballot.
I think Hughes' best chance will be
as a compromise candidate in the
eVent the- convention runs more than
five days."
Nomination speeches for presidential
candidates may be limited to ten
minutes each and seconding speeches
to five minutes for each candidate.
Mr. Upham said the local committee
had received more than 80,000 appli
cations for convention tickets. Tickets
for" the convention, are bringing from
$50 to $250 each.'

Birrell Gives Testimony.
London, May 19.—Augustine BIHrell,
who resigned as chief secretary for
Ireland after the Sinn Fein revolution,
appeared today as a witness before tha
royal commission, which is conducting
an Inquiry Into the Irish rebellion. (Mr.
Birrell stated that he had read Sir
Matthew Nathan's statement of yes
terday, that the government had ad-
1
vance Information of the rebellion, 'and
that he did no know there were any
additions he wished to make. He read
a statement phtah he described as
dealing with* Sinn Feinlam. (Mr. Bir
rell continued:
'If the home rule bill had not been
placed on the statute books theft}
would have been a great explosion of
rage and disappointment both In Ire
land and In the United States, which,
when war came, would have assumed
alarming proportions. The events In
Ulster and the gun-runntngr at L&rne
by the Ulsterltes In 1914 undoubtedly
had a great effect on disloyalists
where." fjgf-
Ireland had preserved an unbroken^
front it the outbreak of the war thru
the patriotism of John Redmond, Mti"
Birrell continued, but there were many-
who did not agree with his attitude.
It was impossible to overestimate the
effect which the advent of the Ulster
leader, Sir Edward Carson, to the cab
inet had exercised upon the minds of
the people of Ireland. If
