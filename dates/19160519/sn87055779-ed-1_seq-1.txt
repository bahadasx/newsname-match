Mr. Roosevelt said he was reluct

make people understand that
speeches at Mich a time are not of
the ordinary political type made in
the interest of some particular indi
Aidual candicacy."
Hut the success of Mr. Ford in the
primaries of Michigan, and his
strength in Nebraska and Penr.sxl
Mini.i had had such an effect on
congressmen, he continued, that he
must speak out.
lake Mr. Ford, the lories of the
resolution and the copperheads of
the Civil war were many of them
"men of tine character and upright

Take Mr. Ford, they proposed to

tinued: "If these pacifists of tbe resolu

serured the applause of every peace-at-ans

County and Highway Attorney
Ask Board to View New
Carlisle Crossing.
A compromise jilan for the Lin
coln highway subway underneath
the Lake Shore railroad and the
Northern Indiana und South Shore
railways at New Carlisle,, has been
submitted by the Indiana I'ublic
service commission, the result of a
conference held at Indianapolis,
Thursday, attended by County Atty.
Patrick J. Houlihan, and A. G. Gra
ham, representing the Lincoln High
way association. The plan presents
a half-way cut between the preseit
highway, insisted upon by the coun
ty commissioners, and w hat is know n
as the Kmmons plan, indorsed by
the railroads. The compromise
1 plan, is by no means satisfactory,
however, and the commission has
been Invited to come to New Carlisle
and South Bend, test out public
opinion, and make a personal in
vestigation of th-? s.tuatior, along
"Safety First "" lines.
The commission plan onteni
plates giving up 1.0U feet of the
old Michigan state road. It calls on
the oilier hand for a new right of
way for a distance of some l.JOO
feet, the difference io expense of
whkh would be about $1.000 against
the counts. This subtiacltd from
a possible saving of ST, 500 in the
cost of building the subway. . wo dd
leave a net saving of only $1.. (('.
which is said to be negligible when
the difference in public safety, fa
vorable to the (dd road, is taken into
account.
Doulhful IVnnoiny.
According to the commission's
figures, the subssay, underneath the
railroads would cost approximately
$ 1 .". 0iu, following the present
highway.; The subway, following the
commission's proposed route, would
cost about $7Ã¤.0i0. In either case
the county would total .:h,000, di
vided $7.r.ef to the county. $14.e(oi
to the Lake Shore, and about $4.eoe
each to the Northern Indiana and
South Shore. Stand off against St.
Joseph county's ST.Ã¤OO, however, the
$t.O00 which the shifting of the
right of way would cost, and the
county's economy is reduced to
$i.:.oo.
Besides the old Michigan state
road, the pre-ent route at that point.
i a straight line, while the commis
sion's plan makes two sharp curves,
meaning a large saving to the rail
roads, i'.it very little to the county.
The Kmmons" plan indorsed by the
railroads, contemplated ;t straight
umler-crossinj: of the railroads, and
two square urns. It is pointed out
that if present plans for building
the road thro ish I'lkhart county are
carried out. thN will be the only
crossing of the Lake hore in this
'section of the state.
