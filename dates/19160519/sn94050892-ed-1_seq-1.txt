Fcr the purpose of hearing a report

Mine Managers regarding the building
of the Clifton-Mogollon highway and,
further, for hearing a report from

C, the Greenlee County Chamber of
Commerce have arranged for a dinner

clicady been made by the mining com
panies of Mogollon to the Arizona

SHERIFF WINS
IN RECALL CASE
Judge O'Connor Rules Petition is In
valid and Will Enter Quashing Or
der Quashing Supervisors' Call for
' an Election ' 1
TUCSON Following the examina
tion of a number of witnesses, circu
lators of the petition to recall Sheriff
Forbes, in which it was brought out
that addresses and dates of signing
were written in by the circulators
themselves, Judge O'Connor, in the
superior, court of Pima county, ruled
that the recall petition is illegal.
"The petition is undoubtedly inval
id," he said.
The formal order, quashing the board
of supervisors' order for an election,
will be entered by Judge O'Connor
this morning, ending the movement to
recall the sheriff on grounds of malad
ministration of his office.
The application for an injunction to
restrain the supervisors from proceed
ing with isteps for tie recall election,
filed last Saturday, will be dismissed,
since the decision of Judge O'Connor,
yesterday has the effect of an injunc
tion . This case was argued yesterday
morning, the plaintiff alleging that the
signatures on the petition filed in. be
half of. Vic S. Griffith, to be the sher
iffs opponent in the recall election,
was not a legal petition in that it did
not contain the percentage of signa
tures required by law.
Whether the opponents of the sheriff
will accept defeat and no attempt to
circulate another recall petition could
not be learned . The circulators of such
a petition would be confronted at the
outset by the ruling of Judge Smith
that a "qualified elector" need not be
registered. Under this decision there
is a great deal of doubt as to how
many signatures on a petition it would
take to make it a legal one.
Edwin F. Jones, attorney for the
sheriff, gave notice of appeal to the
supreme court in the first injunction
case filed by him in behalf of the
sheriff, and he has sixty days in which
to perfect his appeal.
Among the witnesses subpoenaed in
the certioarri hearing were Walter
Wakefield, who had charge of the
circulating of the petitions; George P.
Meyers, Gus Quickenstadt and J. J.
O'Doi. d. Qaickenstedt, being examin
ed c.s to the signatures, admitted that
in one jnstence he had written in the
j-ridresses and dates on an entire page
of the petition. Going through the
petition, he picked out others in which
he had added the addresses and dates
of signing, some of the addresses and
dates being ditto marks. ' Judge
Campbell obtained to the890 7890$123
Campbell objected to the considera
tion of these, but he was overruled .
Quickenstedt also said, when ques
tioned by Attorney Jones, that he
had seen Gus Hoff writing in address
es and dates on a recall petition.
Wakefield and Meyers stated that they
had nothing to do with the circulating
of the petitions. O'Dowd testified that
on the petition which he circulated
the signers themselves had written the
addresses and dates.
Following the testimony of O'Dowd,
County Attorney Hilzingtr announced
that the state would concede that 179
of the signatures were defective if
the court held that the express author!
zation of the signer was necessary to
enable the circulator to write the ad
dress and date. The court announced
that this was its ruling, stating that
the petition was "undoubtedly invalid."

LOCAL BALL TEAM
UP WELL
The Clifton Ball Team Has - Showrj
a Marked Improvement the Past.
Two Weeks and Should Be Able to
Give a Good Account of Itself this
Coming Season
Under the coaching of Capt. Dclan
the Clifton ball boys are showing
speed and lots of pep. In Capt. Do
lan Clifton has a real live ball player
and one that understands the game.
Practice has been held every night at
the ball park and all aspirants for posi
tions on the team are invited to come
out and try and will be given every
opportunity to make good. Waldren
at first and Culver at second showed
decided improvements the past week.
Azarte at 3rd plays his usually fast
game and with Dolan at short the
infield look fast. The two Grimes
boys will be shifted to the outfield,
their hitting is improving and when
playing the outfield should give a good
account of themselves with the stick.
Baron, Foster and Riley are working
for the other outfield positions. Ben
nie has not been out this week and is
undecided as to his playing ball this
summer : : . . "
From all indications Clifton should
have a good team this summer and the
enthusiasm of four years ago should
be revived with a team rapidly round
ing into shape. Arrangements have
been made for the bringing of the
22nd Infantry team here the 27th and
2Sth of May. ' This will give the play
ers their first real try out against
real ball players. The 22nd has the
championship army team and has
held that record for the psat two years
They have practice. every day and
should give a good account of them
selves when here.
' Arrangements are under way to re
vive Morenci and indications are that
the Hill Top city is again going to
come to life and put a good team in
the field. Baseball has been on the
decline since Mr. Van Gorder left the
camp, but from indications the old
spirit will be revived and the rivalry
will be as keen as ever between the
two camps. Clifton and Morenci will
again lock horns at Clifton on Decora
tion day and at Morenci on the 4th of
June .
FIRE DESTROYS FIVE HOUSES
At 2:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon
the lire whistle gave, its warning sig
nal and in a short time the fire boys
were on the ground and doing effec
tive work. The fire was located in
some Mexican houses above the old
smelter site and by the time of the
arrival of the fire fighters the blaze
had gained great headway, the
houses owing to the continued dry
weather burning fiercely. In all five
houses were completely destroyed and
several others were more or less
scorched.
The houses were located on a high
point of rocks and were in a hard posi
tion to get at with the lines of hose
but after the connections had been
made and the hose dragged to t'ie
burning buildings the fire was rapidly
subdued. A good pressure of water
was in the pipes and only to this fact
can be attributed the saving of many
other houses in the vicinity as at the
tin!e a fierce wind was blowing and
for a while it looked as though all the
buildings in the immediate vicinity
would be doomed to destruction.

A
RAGE
Says He is a Democrat But - Cannot
Stand For Governor Hunt's Policies
..PHOENIX, May 15 "Opposition to
the . red flag and enforcement of pro
hibition," is the platform of Dr. H.
A. Hughes, of Phoenix, who has prac
tically decided to run for governor as
a prohibitionist this year.
' -' have not decided definitely that
Z v.-ill get into the race, but I am very
much dissatisfied with the present
lineup in the Democratic and . Re
publican parties," said Dr. Hughes.
' Governor Hunt and George A. "Ol
ney, who are seeking the Democratic
nomination for governor, are both
'wet'. So i3 Tom Campbell, whom
the Republicans are almost sure to
nominate. The Prohibition party is
t. have a ticket in the field.but it will
have absolute? y no chance of success.
Has No Other Course
"Where does that leave me, or any
other man of my principles? I have
fought for prohibition 25 years. For
five -years I was president . of the.
Arizona division of the Anti-Saloon
league. I spent time and money
fighting the saloons and victory was
achieved at a fearful price. Now
neither of the old parties is offering
as a candidate for governor a man
whom a prolfibitionist can conscien
tiously support.
"'fVhat has Hunt done to enforce the
prohibition law? Has he done what the
governors of Colorado and Oregon did
when their states went dry? No, he
hasn't done a thing except, wherever
possible, to make prohibition as obnox
ious as possible, doubtless with a view
to changing public sentiment.
Draws Line at Hunt
"I am a Democrat as well as a pro
hibitionist. In my time, I have con
tributed as much to the support of the
Democratic party as any man in Ari
zona of equal financial resources. I
will support any man the Democratic
party nominates for office, as long as
he is honest nnd a real Democrat, but
3 can never support a Socialist who
rides the Democratic party into power,
and that is just what George W. P.
Hunt hps done."

GEORGE QLNEY IS
MADEWELCQME
IN GREENLEE
Candidate For The Democratic Nomi
nation for Governor is Greeted .by
Host of Old Friends In this Section
Hon. George A. Olney, former
sheriff and member of the Board of
Supervisors from this county, arrived
in Clifton Wednesday evening and
was given a cordial welcome by his
numerous friends here. Mr. Olney
was here in the interest of his candi
dacy for Governor in the democratic
primaries, coming over from Willcox
where he spent Tuesday meeting the
cattlemen of that sections great num
ber of whom he knows personally.bav
ing ben engaged in the cattle busi
ness in that section several years ago.
A number of old timers in this
section were at the train to meet Mr.
Olney and to assure him of their ac
tive support.
There is one circumstance connect
ed with the candidacy of Mr. Olney
for the democratic nomination that
cannot fail to impress the democratic
voter and that is his most enthusias
tic supporters are found among those
old time citizens of the state who have
known him over a period of thirty
years. Some of them have been
associated with him in a business
! way and others have served with
' him in an official capacity, and one
and all testify as to his splendid abili
ty as an executive and his high sense
of honor In dealing with, public ques
tions. In the democratic primaries Green
lee county will be found in the Olney
column. George Olney will carry
every precinct in the county and his
I majority in this county oani be safely
estimated at between four and five
hundred. A conservative estimate
of the majority for Olney in Graham
and Greenlee counties combined is
one thousand.
Mr. Olney has been In northern
Arizona for the past month, and has
visited practically every city in that
cart of the state. Through the whole
district, he declares, prosperity is
evident, and business conditions
have taken on 'an attitude of perman
ency which was " lacking when mine
booins first directed the attention of
Arizonans to the Santa Fe trails
district. .
Speaking of his campaign, Mr. Ol
ney was reticent, but confident. He
declares that northern Arizona is "for
him" as near as he can judge at this
early date, that the Democrats of the
. top-floor counties realize that it is
t'me for a change in the state govern
merit and hie believes he will carry
the roof garden of Arizona by a fair
.majority. Democracy, he states, will
assert itself again in Arizona when
the poll is. taken this fall.
Mr. Olney spent Friday in Morenci
and will leave Saturday morning for
Duncan and Safford . After returning
to his home in Phoenix Mr. Olney
will spend a week in Cochise county.
LIABILITY ACT
APPLIES TO ALL
Supreme Oouit Decides That Man
May 3e Manager for Company, and
Yet Corns Under Employers' Liabili
ty Act.
a decision which has mainly to
do 'vith the defining of the words
"Employer," "Employee" and "Workman,-"
the supreme court yesterday de
cided that A. E. Deyo, who was in
jured while in the employe of the Ari
zona Grading and Construction Com
pany, came under the Employer's Li
ability Act, in spite of the fact that he
was a superintendent, and not a com
mon laborer.
Deyo, while in the employ of the
construction company, had a misad
venture with a shot of blasting powder
which went off when not expected. He
sued the company, in the superior
court of Pima county, Judge William
F. Cooper, presiding.
The case was tried before a jury,and
after Deyo had rested his case, upon
motion by the attorney for the con
struction company, the jury was in
structed by the court to return a ver
dict for the company,"upon the ground
that the plaintiff .had failed to estab
lish his status as a workman but had
shown himself to have been the gen
eral superintendent and manager of
defendant corporation and that the ac
cident was not shown to have arisen
out of or in the course of the labor,
services or employment for which he
was engaged by the defendant com
pany." The appeal was prosecuted
from the order directing a verdict and
from the judgment.
The supreme court holds that a man
I engaged to work for a company, no
i matter what his position.is in its em
j !'!oy, and as such was the case the
i superior court of Pima county erred
i in ordering the jury to bring in a ver
dict for the defendant. The case was
reversed and remanded for new trial.
Justice Cunningham specially con
curred in the opinion.
Every evening some men try to
think up something to boast about to
the neighbors.
NATIONAL GUARD
IN NEW TENT '
HOMES
DOUGLAS. Mav 14. With 0 ls '
of wind whipping across the desert
and half veiling in a dust haze the
distant mountains that rim the flat on
which is Douglas, the Arizona National
Guardsmen spent yesterday in putting
the finishing touches to their new tent
homes in the concentration camp.
uut to tne south, too far to be
distinguished "by the naked eye, and
only occasionally visible through
powerful field glasses, 2,000 soldiers '
of General Calles are encamped,
while to the north of the guardsmen
and probably 1,000 yards farther
from the international line, are the
regular troopers of the United States.
The fact that the guardsmen are be. .
tween the regulars and the interna
tional line is one of the first pecu
liarities that appears to the casual
observer, and the remark several
years ago of a regular army officer
comes to mind. vThe remark was
made during the siege of Naco when
Governor Hunt threatened to call
out the militia to aid in protecting
the people in the border town where
casualties from Mexican bullets were
occurring daily. Informed of the gov
ernor's resolution to call out the
guard, a regular army man remarked
that if the guardsmen came, he would
be glad to afford them the same pro
tection from the Mexicans that he was
giving to the townspeople in Naco.
The guardsmen according to a jest
that is now .going the rounds of the
camp, are "protecting the regulars."
Although a traditional feud has al
ways seemed to exist between regu
lars and state troops heretofore, the
spirit of fraternity which is appar
ent at the Douglas camp is one of
the most no te worth v fnatiincta nf tha
1 attitude of the men toward each
' other. Visitine parties or - resrular
army officers and enlisted men spent
much of the afternoon yesterday In
camp, and little suggestions for small
comforts here and there in arrang
c'luiijuicuL were passeu oacK ana
forth. To Captain Sidney Mashbir,
of Company K, goes the palm for in
ventive genius in prelecting a . new
adobe process for the floors of the
tents of hta outfit T-fo ia
! that it will prove a successful sub
' stitute for a real cement floor.
I Although the first excitement of
one at the camp, the afternoon
brought an opportunity for rest to
the tired memhera nf tho marH nnlv
the men of the hospital corps, swamp
ed with many arduous duties, non.
tinuing to work until evening. Many
new recruits were being received at
the company headquarters, and a
long line was awaiting examination
by Dr. Bascom Morris, lieutenant of
the hospital corps. . Armed with a
stethoscope and backed up by a formidable-looking
table loaded with
curious instruments, the doctor took
each new man in turn for a thor
ough "once over", testing teeth, and
chest, and weight, and height and
passing the smiling.'i,rookie" on to
the company to which he was ba
signed.
Although the , first' excitement of
the new life has' hot entirely been
eradicated, the .hard labor, of the
first few days of making eamp, was
apparent in the attitude of the men.
Few applied for permission to go to'
towii in the evening. An hour after
"retreat" had been aniinrinri nt 8
o'clock, when the lights in Douglas
began to glimmer through the gather
ing dusk, most of the men' were ia
camp.
At "tattoo" time,' " at 9 o'clock a
! lazy moon 'was Iboking down on
quiet squadrons of tents, most of
which were already in darkness, and
"taps" sounded through the deserted
company street without disturbing
the rest of even the lightest sleeper.
