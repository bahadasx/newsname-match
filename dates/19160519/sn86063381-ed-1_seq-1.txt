GHARTERAMENDMENT
NOT NECESSARY TO
BUYRUGGLESTIMBER
Attorney McDonald in Letter to
Charter Commission Points Out
State Law.
CITY CAN BOND FOE
PARKS UNDER STATE ACT
\mds Can Be Issued Not to Exceed
Two Per cent of Assessed
Valuation.
The charter of the City of Bemidji
need not be amended to secure the
Ruggles' timber north of the Bemidji
mill for park purposes. This is
pointed out today by Attorney E. E.
McDonald in a letter to A. P. White,
president of the Bemidji charter
commission.
Attorney McDonald points out in
r1
rtis letter that under a state law, the
city council can pass an ordinance
for the securing of property within
a two-mile limit of the city for park
purposes. The city can issue bonds
for the buying of the park without
being restricted by any indebtedness
of the city.
Up to Council.
Attorney McDonald's letter is as
fallows:
""My attention has been called to
an item in the Bemidji Pioneer in
which it is said that it is proposed
to amend the city charter so as to
permit the city of Bemidji to acquire
the Ruggles timber on the east side
of the lake for park purposes.
"Your attention is called to Chap
ter 486, General Laws 1909 (Sec.
1746-1753, General Statute of Minn.
12*$.) This act provides that cities
like the city of Bemidji, may, by two-
thirds of the votes of its council at
a regular meeting, pass an ordinance
expressing its intention and desire
to take advantage of that act. There
upon, the territory embraced in such
city shall be deemed, and thereby de
clared to be, a park district of this
state. Such ordinance, before it
shall take effect, shall be submitted
to the voters at regular city or spe
cial election and approved by a ma
jority of those voting thereon. Such
park district shall have a seal and
perpetual succession, with power to
sue and be sued, contract and be con
tracted with, acquire by purchase,
gift, devise or otherwise and hold,
^n, possess and maintain property
,\a trust for the purpose of parks,
i boulevards and ways and to exercise
I all the powers necessary in connec
tion therewith. The power of such
park district shall be exercised by a
board of commissioners consisting of
five members who shall hold office
for a period of five years from and
after date of their election and quali
'?atien and until their successors are
duly elected and qualified except the
members of the first board, who shall
hold office from one, two, three years,
i etc. The city treasurer shall be ex
officio treasurer of the park district.
i Members of the commission shall be
I elected at the annual meeting except
i that the first board may be elected at
a special election. The board shall
afrfve no compensation for their ser-
T( vices. This commission shall have
power to acquire by purchase, etc., as
I above recited, any land within the
city limits or within two miles there-
's from for parks, boulevards and way.*,
and power to open, grade and other-

the affirmative vote of the electors
to issue bonds in an amount in the
aggregate not to exceed 5 per cent of
the assessed valuation.
1 Can Issue Bonds. i
**i mi will note that under this law
kthe park commission may issue bonds
without regard to the indebtedness
jlof the city. The assessed valuation
of the property within the city of
jBemidji for 1915 was over $2,000,-

I bonds to the extent of two per cent
thereof without submitting the mat

could issue bonds to the extent of five
per-cent of the assessed valuation up
on a vote of the people, which would
give a revenue of $100,000.
"The advantage of proceeding un
der the general law that I have re
ferred to you is that the park dis
trict can acquire lands within two
miles of the limits of the city and is
not restricted in borrowing money
by any indebtedness of the city.
"No doubt, the park district could
borrow of the state the funds neces
sary to purchase eighty acres of the
tract covered by the Ruggles timber
north of the Bemidji mill.

Berlin, May 19 Feeling here is
strong that a neutral such as the
United States might succeed if it
undertook to negotiate for peace.
Diplomatic circles consider that the
recent statements of Sir Edward Grey
were the opening guns for peace. One

peace move now was no more diffi
cult than adjusting the German-Am

SPECIAL CABS TO BRING

Griffith Proves That No Good Can

Inspire Patriotism.
Many seats are being sold for "The
Birth of a Nation" which will be
shown in Bemidji Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
at-the Grand theater. It is believed
that the theater will be crowded at
each performance. Many mail or

Company of 35.
"The Birth of a Nation" company,
including about 35 people, will ar
rive in Bemidji Sunday morning from
Brainerd in a private Pullman sleep
er. The equipment of the company
will be sent here in two private bag
gage cars.
It was pointed out today by a rep
resentative of the company that the
play will inspire patriotism, teach
history, prolong peace and command
respect for drama and music better
than any offering before the public
today.
War is Hell.
D. W. Griffith, perhaps a thousand
fold more effectively than he realized
while he was making it, has proven
that war is actually hell, made and
fed by manin his spectacle of spec
tacles, "The Birth of a Nation," and
that hatreds and spites that are bred
fromJt between peoples who partiei
^BMccWeTeta are eternal damnation
here on earth.
After witnessing Mr. Griffith's most
glorious and exhaustive treatise on
the subject, one more than ever prays
for an everlasting peace and a settle
ment by arbitration rather than fur
ther armed conflict.
Widows, orphans, wrecked homes
and hearts everywherethe aged
parents and weeping little son and
daughter, brother and sister all over
the throbbing world, are the ones
who will heartily say "Amen" to this
everlasting lesson of war. When
one of fair mind witnesses this mar
velous reproduction he cannot be
lieve that Griffith, as has been said
of him, has been all these years nurs
ing his wrath against the North and
struck with this mighty weapon
when he knew he could do the most
far-reaching damage to the cause of
his country's enemies. He will be
lieve, rather, that Griffith, being an
great artist, saw his chance to alarm
the world with the greatest, most
dynamic thing yet and he took it,
with the result that all readers to
day knows.

T. R. BRINGS DIRE
WARNINGTOFORD'S
HOME TOWN TODAY
Detroit, Mich., May 19.Theodora
Roosevelt brought a dire warning to
Henry Ford's home town today.
He lambasted Ford's pacificism
raked Wilson's "make believe prepar
edness" accused influential Germans
of reflecting the German government
approving pacificists' plans in the
United States with an idea of keeping
America unprepared, and dubbed the
present governmental representatives
96 per cent feeble.
He claimed that he bore for Henry
Ford real friendship and in many
cases genuine admiration. Then he
classified Ford with the Tories of the
Revolutionary war and the Copper
heads of the sixties.
Two thousand people greeted
Roosevelt here with much enthu
siasm. Roosevelt's plans of visiting
Ford's plants have been cancelled.
Ford visited at Roosevelt's hotel at
three o'clock this afternoon.
Roosevelt in his address said in
part:
"My plea is that all our citizens
today shall act in the spirit of the
men of many different race strains
the Washingtons, Adamses and Lees,
the Schuylers and Sullivans the Car
rolls and Muhlenbergs, the Marions
and Herkimerswho disregarded all
questions of national origin and be
came Americans and nothing else
when they founded this country.
"We all stand together for our
common flag and our common coun
try. We must so prepare that this
country will be a good place in which
the children's children of all of us
shall live and to do this we must 30
prepare that we can repel all for
eign foes and preserve the inestimable
right of settling for ourselves the
fate of this mighty democratic re
public.

Arrested,
El Paso, May 19.Sergeant Harry
Furman, a member of the machine
gun company of the 23rd infantry,
was shot and killed on Mexican soil
a mile and a half east of Juarez late
yesterday by Mexican custom guards.
General Gavira, Juarez command
er, and other Mexican officials say
Furman crossed the international
boundary in an intoxicated condi
tion and fired on the custom guard
before he was made the target of
their fire.
Furman's company commander says
that he saw the sergeant but a short
time before the shooting and that he
appeared perfectly sober. The shoot
first was reported by General Qa
vira to General Bell at Fort Blinn.
General Bell detailed Major General
George D. Moore and Captain William
B. Graham of the 20th infantry to
make a joint investigation in com
pany with the Mexican military judge
and two officers named by General
Gavira.
After Stray Horse.
This investigation disclosed that
Furman, while searching for a stray
horse, rode a horse upon a strip of
Mexican soil left north of the Rio
Grande,by the .shifting of the river
bed. He was armed with a pistol.
American army men admit that no
was not within his rights in penetra
ting Mexican soil.
His pistol had been recently fired,
two chambers being emptied.
Major Bell said he had no evidence
to show whether Furman or the Mexi
can fired first. General Bell will re
port the matter to General Funston.
The entire 23rd infantry regiment
today mourned the death of Sergeant
Furman. He was one of the most
popular men in the regiment, being
its crack machine gun operator and
all around athlete and a splendid
horseman.
Scout Drunkenness.
The idea that the sergeant could
have been intoxicated is scouted by
officers and enlisted men alike.
It was said that shortly after Fur
man left to round up the stray mules
he had ridden the most fractions
horse in the regiment over the hurdle,
a feat he could not have accomplish
ed, it was contended, if he had not
been perfectly sober. Furman was
serving his second enlistment.
General Gavira says American sol
diers witnessed the shooting but
made no effort to return the fire of
the Mexicans.
At Camp Cotton it was said that
while shots were heard, nobody wit
nessed the tragedy.
