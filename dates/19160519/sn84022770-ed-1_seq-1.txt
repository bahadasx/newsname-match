City to Submit Additional Arguments
in Support of Harbor.
Further information which it is
believed will convince the board of
engineers of the war department that
the Olympia harbor project is a
worthy one and should receive the
government aid asked, will be gath
ered by the trustees of the local
Chamber of Commerce.
The engineers informed the board
Monday that in their opinion addi
tional improvement of the harbor is
not warranted at this time, but gave
the city another opportunity to pre
sent its claims before June 12 and
also offered to conduct a public hear
ing upon the project this summer.
The trustees, at a special meeting
Monday evening, voted to take action
at once to gather additional informa
tibn upon the chief points involved in
the improvement, and also to arrange
for the public hearing.
WKBETT REFUNDS
$252.25 IIEMS
RETIRING COMMISSIONERS ALSO
ISSI'E STATEMENT ON THEIR
WORK IN DEPARTMENT
Advised by the attorney general's
department of a difference of $252.25
in his expense account vouchers, cov
ering sums spent by him while trav
eling on departmental business but
not itemized in the vouchers, Floyd
L. Daggett, retiring chairman of the
insurance commission, im
htediately gave the state a check for
this sum this week, as he had pre
viously announced he would do.
"I will give the state a check for
that amount," Mr. Daggett said when
apprised of the result of the check
by the attorney general's department,
"and I hope they will let me retire to
private life in peace now.
"I have been on the road for the
state for three years and in that time
I have traveled 35,000 miles. The
amount of difference in the record
and the vouchers is about fl a week
for the time 1 was out of the office
for the state. My expenses ran about
f25 a week more than I charged to
the state. I want to add, too, that
none of the $l6O alleged to have been
misappropriated was used for poker
or whisky. I have never taken a dol
lar from the state that I was not en
titled to."
Commissioners Issne Statement.
In a signed statement issued late
last week, the retiring commission
ers, Chairman Daggett, A. B. Ernst
and Clarence Parker, expressed re
gret that a defalcation bad occurred
in the department, cited the fact that
State Auditor Clausen had been re
elected after having paid $50,000 in
fraudulent claims for Ortls Hamilton,
said they had felt justified in trast
ing heads of departments, pointed
out that since January 1 the claim
department had been thoroughly re
organized BO that "a fraudulent
claim or transaction cannot now be
put through without the collusion of
several employes," and said that
plans for improving the methods in
the auditing department had been
worked out and submitted to the
governor two months ago for bis ap
proval.
"The present commissioners have
collected more than $4,600,000 and
paid out in claims and pensions $4,-
400,000," the statement went on to
say. "The fraudulent claims amount
to less than $20,000. In this same
period 48,747 claims have passed
through the department—lß of these
were fraudulent.
"We have from 50 to 60 employes
in the Olympia office, branch offices
and traveling over the state. In
comparison we have very few com
plaints. The amount of fraudulent
claims amount to less than one-half
of 1 per cent. We doubt whether
there is a bank in the state doing this
amount of business that does not lose
this much through fraud.

"We retire with the Arm convic

ment conscientious and efflicient serv
ice and a desire to do our full duty."
the statement said in conclusion.

WOULD CANCEL LICENSES
OF ALL FAKE ORU6GISTS
Governor Thinks Violators of Dry
Law Should Be Summarily
Penalized.
Governor Lister this week declared
his belief that state licenses could
and should be taken from druggists
convicted of illegally selling liquor,
and in a formal letter to the secrer
tary of the state board of pharmacy
he urges that such action be taken
promptly if the necessary statutory
means are available.
The governor outlined his idea of
the situation in a letter to Secretary
Garrison of the state board of phar
macy, in which he stated: "If it is
found to be within your authority to
take away the license of any pharma
cist who. has been found guiity of
violating the law, I personally be
lieve it ought to be done."
One indication of what the fake
drug stores established under the dry
law are doing is an increase in sala
ries offered registered drug clerks, in
some instances amounting to S6O per
month. Where clerks formerly re
ceived from SIOO to $125 monthly,
new drug stores started since the
first of the year, and numerous old
ones, have bid salaries up to $176.
While not objecting at all to the
clerks receiving more pay, the gov
ernor wants assurance that the rea
sons for it are economic instead of
alcoholic.
AGRICULTURAL BUREAU
IS PLANNING ITS WURK
Second Meeting Friday Night to Act
on Plan of Organization
Details of the organization of the
Agricultural Bureau of the Chamber
of Commerce, such as the number
and nature of the standing commit
tees, and the particular lines of work
the Bureau is to follow, will be de
termined at the second meeting of
the members of the Bureau at the
Chamber of Commerce Friday night.
C. C. Aspinwall of Mud Bay is chair
man of the Bureau.
Twenty-five of the 38 members of
the Bureau attended the first meeting
last Friday night, made Frank 1(.
Kenney chairman of the good roads'
committee, which supervised the work
done Good Roads' Day last Tuesday;
authorized a special county fair com
mittee and another to co-operate with
the Cow-Testing association Just
formed. P. R. Klumb was named
chairman of the former and W. W.
Manier of the latter and, under the
rule of the Bureau, each selects his
associates. Mr. Klumb named C. A.
Rose and E. M. McClintic.
The Bureau voted to meet on the
first and third Friday nights of each
month, and tonight will hear the re
port of the special committee ap
pointed to recommend the committee
organization and plan of work, after
conferring with the secretary of the
Chamber on reports as to how simi
lar Bureaus in other cities are organ
ised. This committee consists of
Eagle Freshwater chairman, F. M.
Kenney, C. D. King, C. J. Van Eaton
and A. T. Rabeck.

ganized department and an efficient
force of employes, the equal of any
with private corporation or public
institution."
The attorney general's department
has not yet given an opinion on the
commissioners' query whether the
state could recover the amount of its
loss from the banks which cashed the
fraudulent warrants, but it is pointed
out that the precedent set in the
Ortis Hamilton case, when the legis
lature returned to the banks tbe
amount that had been recovered from
them, would indicate the legislature
would do the same in this instance,
and the attorney general's office sees
little to be gained in going to the ex
pense of suits to compel restitution.

POINT TO BE UEDICATEU
Heeldento of Neighborhood Will Hold
a Awl- of Celebrations
Saturday.
Saturday is to be a "big day" for
the Hunter's Point neighborhood, for
then its residents plan to gather to
gether for the celebration of the clos
ing of the school year, the last meet

]
tion and the Literary Society and,
equally as important as all these, the
dedication of the new dock just com
pleted. near the mouth of Mud Bay,
the first time in 40 years that such a
landing has been available.
The celebration will start in the
afternoon with the school exercises
and will occupy the afternoon and
evening, various entertainment fea

ings of the Parent-Teacher associa
tion and the Literary society are to
be conducted jointly, while the dedi

these other exercises are ended.
The new landing was first used
last Saturday, and in honor of the
day the launches "Tarrynot" and
"Aeolus" brought Hunter's Point
residents to the city without charge.
The dock was built by the residents
of the neighborhood at a cost of ap
proximately SI,OOO, the farmers fur-'
nishing the piling and doing a large
part of the work, while John Rignell
paid the expense of driving the pil
ing. The work was done in about
two weeks.
The dock is similar to the city
dock in Olympia, having a floating
landing rising and falling with the
tide, reached by a chute. It is 340
feet long, the main dock is about 50
feet square and the main drive about
14 feet wide. It was presented to
the county and accepted by the com
missioners.

to Hunter's Point by steamer or
launch had to alight fro mthe larger
boat into a rowboat, before landing.
The new dock makes this unnece

maintenance of an experimental
