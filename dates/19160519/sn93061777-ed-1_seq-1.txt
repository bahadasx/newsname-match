We appeal to the people of

Militia Companies from stations
near the border have had no

people of these placts realize the
need of a strong patrol along
this border that is infested with
thieves and murderers.
Men! wea are not doing our

other parts, but Curry County

heifers which they will put on

of the same high grade stuff at
Aden, N. M. on June 12. They
have only about 250 head left on
their ranch besides the 500
thoroughbreds. Mr. Shipley
says that the only profitable way
to acquire a herd of $85 or $90
cows is to buy them when they
are yearling and keep them un
til they make cows. He pre
sents convincing argument to
substant iate this statement.

will play the Tucumcari Elks'

The Clovis "BILLS" accompani
ed by their families, will go over

to T. M. Davenpart, of the social
committee of the Clovis lodge,
says in part:
"Saturday afternoon we will
get acquainted and Saturday
night we will have a dance at
the club. Sunday afternoon we
should get started on the game
by 2 o'clock and finish by 4
o'clock in time for you to reach
the cap ro:k before dark." Con
tinuing Mr. James says, "I wish
some time this summer we could
arrange a "half way" picnic of
some kind. We could meet at
the breaks and everybody take
a basket lunch and enjoy the oc
casion out in the country. I am
very much in favor of these
"get together" parties. Let us
have a good time this summer."
Athough the new suits which
have been ordered for the Clovis
team will not arrive in time for
the game, they will come in
handy later on when it is expect
ed to arrange games and picnics
with Amarillo, Plainview and
Roawell. At least twenty cars
are expected to make the trip
Sunday.
Do You Have Faith in Clovis
Some of the Chamber of Com
merce workers have inaugurated
a "booster" campaign, They
are having personal cards print
ed with the "Booster Creed"
printed on the back. Every
business man in Clovis should
adopt the plan. Following is
the creed:
"We believe in Clovis, the best
town in eastern New Mexico
and the future metropolis of the
plains country.
We believe in boosting and not
knocking; in looking forward in-
siead of backward; in being
optimistic instead of p-sim-tie
and in lending a hand to any
(worthy cause that will ben-.-iii
our town.
We Micve in the business
men, the professiona! men, the
! laboring nu-n, the railroad men.
and every citizen of Clovis, and
in our opinion they are tin most
, progressive and intelligent class
ot peop.e to oe tourd am win. re.
We believe in our schools and
our churche and ail othi-r
agencies calculated to improve
our boys und our giri:; to tim end
that they !!i;:y grow up t he in
telligent, upright and honest
citizens.
We be.ieve that in Clovis the
sun shines just a liti.e brighter,
the rain fails a little more gent
ly, the v. iodo kiss us a litte more
kindly and the stars twinkle a
little more brilliantly than any
where eise in the country.
We believe in the "10.O0U in
habitants in lUliO" slogan and
will strive in all legitimate ways
to bring this about.
And last but not least, we be
lieve in Curry county and the
sturdy farmers who compose the
citizenship thereof, who. by
their untiring efforts are pro
during the finest grains, the
fattest cattle, the sleekest horses
and the best hogs to be found
anywhere."

G. C. Brock (or Tax Assessor
In this issue of the News ap
pears the announcement of Grov
er Cleveland Brock for the office
of Tax Assessor of Curry county.
The name, "Grover Cleveland."
would at least indicate that Mr.
Brock was born and reared a
Democrat, which is actually the
case. He has always voted the
ticket and worked for the best
interests of the party.
Mr. Brock has been in this
section about nine years, having
resided in Clovis fo; the past
three years. He was born on a
farm in Texas about 30 years
ago, where he learmed well,
from good, honest, industrious
parents the lesson of honesty
and industry. He has held a
responsible position with the
Santa Fe Railroad for five years.
Here he made good as he had
done in other undertakings. He
has, in addition to a good literary
education, a good commercial
education, and is, in e ery way
qualified to fill the office to which
lie aspires.
W. B. Shipley
A typical western man with
western ways and manner of do
ing things is W. B. Shipley, can
didate for the office of County
Commissioner from the Melrose
district. Mr. Shipley has spent
his life on the plains, having re
moved here five years ago from
Floydada, Texas, where he was
reared. For several years he
had a ranch a few miles west of
St Vrain but now he is engaged
in stock-farming on his place
six miles norh of Melrose. Mr.
Shipley being a westerner by
birth at.d adoption, understands
the tips and downs of the stock
man farmer. He especially ap
peals to that class of paople to
support him for the position to
v. hxh he aspires.
