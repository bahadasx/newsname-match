The rite of laying of cornerstone is
very simple. Before the work of
building a church is set about, the rub
ric directs that adequate provision
should be made for its maintenance,
also the foundations are~to~ be mar Iced
out subject to the approval ""of the
Bishop or his delegate, and a wooden
ctoss set up to indicate the place where
the altar is to stand. In _the function
which ensues, the Bishop first blesses
holy water with the ordinary forms,
then sprinkles the place where the cross
stands and afterwards the foundation
stone. Upon the stone itself he is di
rected to engrave crosses on each side
with a knife, and then he pronounces
the following prayer, "Bless, O Lord,
this creature of stone (creaturam
istam lapidis) and grant by the invoca
tion of thy holy name that all who with
ing of this church may obi
ness of body and the healing of their
souls. Through Christ our Lord,
Amen." After the Litany of the
Saints, followed^by an appropriate an
tiphon and Psalm cxxvi. "Unless the
Lord build the house" etc., the stone
lowered into its place with another
prayer and again sprinkled with holy
water. More antiphons and psalms
follow, while the Bishop once more
visits and sprinkles the] other founda
tinns, dividing them into three sections
and ending each little tour with a
special prayer. Finally the "Veni
Creator [Spiritus" is sung, and two
short prayers. Then the Bishop, if he
deems it opportune, sits down and ex
horts the people to contribute to the
fabric, after which he dismisses them
with his blessing and the proclamation
of an indulgence.
