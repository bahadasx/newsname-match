The Sunday excursion was
light on account of the very in
clement weather. About 25 per
sons came from the Valley and
about as many more got on the
train at Elk City. Toledo and at,8" !.?l'!ff.h.er
a geiiuciimii
port said about one hundred
years ago they had the same
kind of winter and spring. He
said it rained all summer and
the bays and sloughs were cov
ered with ducks and geese. He
thought the same kind of
weather would be repeated this
Bummer.
The Commercial Club held
very interesting meeting at
wm'"'"'cam9 back from Beaver Creek
A large amuum-m uumiicoo wuo
transacted. A number of very
!"te-Ug.I!Lr
among them a report oil the
Beaver Creek road.
The people
munlty have
in that i com-
exhibited as
much or more
nubile spirit in
the matter of building roads
than any other section of the
county. The road they are
building now runs from Ona on
the north side of-Beaver Creek
to the beach at the mouth of
,1,. o,,i' inquire of four!
the creek, a distance or lour
miles. It will cost $1,000 per
mile to build the road. The
brushed out the
and the next
thing to blow out the stumps,
This will require about 1500 or;
2000 pounds of powder. Mr. M.
L Commons and Bud Webber
the road supervisor, were by in- !
vltatlon of the Club, present
and explained in detail what the .
community had done towards
building the road. Mr. Com
mons was the spokesman. He
complimented the County Court
for what it had done to aid in
building the road and the peo
ple for what they had done to
help in the work. Giving one
months labor gratuitously for
that purpose which is equiva
lent to $1,000 and completes
one mile of roajl. The people
of that neighborhood are anx
ious to get to the market and
a snipping point. rnis roaa
gives them a water grade, and
an easy way to get out. Mr.
Commons asked that the New
port people buy the powder for
blasting out of the stumps. A
committee of five was appointed
to look into the matter at once
and report. It is thought that
30 percent of the Newport road
fund could be applied for that
purpose.
The good roads proposition is
the most important question be
fore the people. The County
Court, under the direction of the
road master Mr. ' A. J. Porter,
has planed a large amount of
road work for this year. The
proposed road from Elk City to
Mill Creek is four miles in
length with a water grade, Mr.
Porter says it will be a very easy
road to build. This is important
as it gives the people a wagon
road to the County Seat. The
trestle work connecting the
South Beach wagon road with
the dock to be built on deep
water at the east side of the big
sand spit where boats can land
is important. This distance
is a little less than liaif a mile
long.
A force of men are now work
lng on the road that cuts out
Pioneer Mountain. This road
leaves the Corvallis road at the
mouth of Simpson Creek three
miles west of Chltwood ; and f ol
lows up the creeK over a low
pass to Olalla Creek and down
that creek to its intersection
ith the Newport road near the
Jay Dunn place, lhe worn on
. Bald Mountain Road is pro
gressing right along although it
is a heavy piece of work. This
road will be 9000 feet long with
1300 feet of solid rock. In the
South part of the county im
portant road work is going on,
This the public high way from
distance will be four miles with
a four per cent grade. SileLs
has already done a large amount
of road work and will do more.

These were the figures on the
score board, when the last man

Elk City started out to win
and played ball for eight innings,
holding Toledo to two tallies and
the Elk City boys chasing 13

In the first half of the ninth,
Toledo opened fire with their 42
centimeter Beige guns, and Elk
City took for their trenches, let

round to the score keeper be

enough.

Monday morning a large crew
of men with five good teams,
responded to the call of Deputy
Road Supervisor, W. C. Weber
for volunteer work to complete
the first mile of road on the new
Beaver Creek road leading to
the beach.
The weather was very un
pleasant and showery all day
but that did not have a depress
ing effect on the boys who came
out to push the work. They all
worked with a royal good will
as men do when they have a
purpose to accomplish.
Tuesday morning the weather
ented the crowd getting to
gether until almost eleven when
four of the "braves" went out
and blasted stumps until noon,
after lunch they were joined by
five more men and together
they put in some good work.
Wednesday gave promise of
nice weather and the men came
out in force. R. W. Ohmart has
been In charge of the crow which
has been slashing out the entire
right-of-way to the beach. One
more dny will finish this part oZ
the work. This crew is on the
Job with the volunteer worker
this week and are working Just
as hard with their donation work
as if they were being paid for
their labors. When you find
men who go to and from their
work whistling, who "npur up":
their teams to hurry to the next
piece of work that must be done,
you will know just the kind of
men we have In Ona who are
contributing their time when
they are very busy on their
ranches. We do not want to
"toot our own horn" but wc
want everyone to know how we '
"dig in" to "make good" when
wo are given any encourage
ment. We know the County hat,
many miles of road to keep up
and while the County Court has
boon very generous with us, they '
cannot afford to give us all the
money we need 011 roads In this
community bo wc are doing our
share.
If all communities in the
County would ornnlo and help '
themselves Just a llttlo the road
work would not bo the "mill
stone" It. la, on the neck of our
County Court, who are, wo wc
fully convinced, honest and fair
minded men, and ve want them
to know we appreciate the help
