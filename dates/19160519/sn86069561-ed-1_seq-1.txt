Lutes & Co , bidding onU on the

Which ?
Of course you'll' want atjeast one serviceable suit
for "all occasion" use this spring.
You have more room for choice this year, for weVe
secured a beautiful new Clothcraft gray serge suit,
'6130r from the same house that makes the well
known "5130" Blue.
You'll wonder how it's possible to get so much
good style and careful workmanship for $15.00.
It's bscause the makers have specialized on medium-priced clothes
for 70 years. The Clothcraft factory ranks among the foremost in the
country in scientific methods of manufacture.
It's a case where good wages, fair treatment and high ideals have
produced better quality at lower cost.
Blue or Gray $15.00 which shall it be ?

cure it you must take an internal
remedy. Hall's Catarrh Cure is

the blood on the mucous sutaces
of the system Hall's Catarrh
Cure was prescribed by one of
the best physicians in this country
for years It is composed of some
of the best tonics known, com
bined with some of the best blood
purifiers. The perfect combina
tion of the ingredients in Hall's
Catarrh Cure is what produces
such wonderful results in catarrh

or somebody is mighty low on this
work. Whether Mr. Griffin and
his associates have bid tins work
too low or not, is not a question for
the people of Rockcastle to worry
over, but on the other hand they
should rejoice that these men have
figured that they can do tho work
at the price named. At neither
ot the other bids offered could the
Fiscal Court have been justified in
awarding a contract for the entire
line, because there would not have
been sufficient money to back it up.
At the price for which the contract
has been let, and if the same stand
ard can be maintained, there is
hope for a completion of Rock
castle's two roads through the
county. The contract calls for the
starting of the work may 25th, and
the completion of the road from
Livingston to Brodhead by Janu
ary 1st, 1917.
