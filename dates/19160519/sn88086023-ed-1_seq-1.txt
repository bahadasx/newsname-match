BT CARL ACKERMAN.)
BERLIN. May l.There la a feel
ing here that If a atrong neutral na
tion Ilka America undertook to ne
gotiate for peace 'it might succeed.
Diplomats regard the recent state
ments of Pol near and Grey aa th
opening guna of an Informal peace
dlacuatlon. although the expressions
of the allied leaders, ranged along
side Hollweg'H recant speech, no not
appear conciliatory. There haa been
no decision whether or not a reply to
Potncare and Grey atatementa will be
published here, but It la probable a
reply will be made. One official said
that the making of peace now would
not be more difficult than .adjusting
the submarine issue.
I have just returned from Holland
The Dutchmen believe that the
French, English and Oerman people
dealre peace. The Impression In Hol
land la that the time for a decisive
victory haa passed, although a sum
mer offensive on each side Is expect
ed. The Dutch think It is America'
duty to act now. They believe the
time 1 ripe for bringing the belliger
ents together. One aald that If peace
talk continue! for a few montha each
aide will learn enough of what the
other wants to bring peace by Oc
tober. Holland believes that Asquith
and Hollweg might make peace, Wit
the Polncare. Kitchener and North
cllffe group are anxious to continue
the war.
Hollanders believe that the war
g-nup In England expects America
will become Involved with Germany
over the submarine issue. While
there Is a chance of America becom
ing involved they think England
should continue the war. The Dutch
tire most friendly toward the United
States, desiring that America lead the
way to peace.
I waa surprised when the Dutch
asked me when the German food re
volt would start. Although food Is
short and the shortage may increase,
the new government regulations pre
vent food demonstrations and pro
vide for liveable rations. Nothing
like the Irish rebellion is likely here.

Hard Job on Its Hands to

SAN ANTONIO. Chihuahua. May
19. Chasing the Vllltstas is like
fighting a stubborn fire for as the
Americans squelch them in one place
they break out In another. American
troops have clashed with the main
body of Vllltstas four times. In each
case the enemy lost heavily and tha
force scattered and broken. Thrice
the bandits reorganized and recruit
ed to almost their original strength.
There Is every possibility that they
will do so again.
Dodd defeated the Vllltstas In a
running fight at Guerrero. Pour days
later Brown surprised the scattered
remnants at Agua Callentes. The only
stand that the Vllllstas made was
against Dodd at Tomachlc on the 22.
Although badly whipped a hundred
got together and gave Howse a battle
at ojoasules. Nearly half the force
was left dead. Despite their over
whelming defeats, it is still an open
question whether the band will form

Pacificists Are
Denounced by T. R.
COLOXEL TAKES RAF AT ADMIN-
ISTR ATION AND PREPARED
NESS FLANS.
DETROIT. May l . Roosevelt car
ried his message of warning into
Ford's bailiwick today. He denounc.
ed pacificists methods, raked Wilson's
administration and the make-believe
preparedness and asserted that only
a policy of staunch readiness can keep
America in the forefront of the world's
affairs.
He accused influential Germans of
approving the plans of the German
American Pacificists In keeping Am
erica unprepared and maintaining
Germany's readiness. He said he
had a friendly feeling and In many
respects a genuine admiration toward
Ford, but he classified him with the
torles of the revolution and the cop
perheads of the civil war. He read a
letter which a Berlin professor wrote
to Professor Appleman of the Univer
sity of Vermont, saying that the Ger
man-Americans should not vote for
more preparedness because should
America and Japan go to war, Ger
many would probably adopt an atti
tude of benevolent neutrality toward
Japan. He advocated a standing ar
my of a quarter of a million and uni
versal military training.
The colonel said "The ultra-pad-flclsts
made a great showing UllBli
; all. because there has been no real
resolute opposition. The adminis
tration and a majorlt) of congress
have taken no steps toward pre
paredness or have done nothing ef

They have stood for applied peaclfl

a people we must decide whether we
