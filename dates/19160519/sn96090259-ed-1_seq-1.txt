W. G. GARDNER DEAD
President of C. & N. W. R'y Died Last Week
at Osterville, Massachussets
William A. Gardner, president of
the Chicago & North Western Railway
and the Chioago, St. Paul, Minneapolis
& Omaha Railway, died last week at
his sammer home in Osterville, Masea
ohuBsets. He left his desk in Chioago
about ten days ago for a brief rest, and
his end was sudden. His wife was
with him at the time of his death.
The passing of the president of the
North Western waB a shook through
out the railroad world today, Officials
of the lines of which he was head paid
tributes to their ohief today and re
vealed characteristics of the man
whioh they believed aided him in
reaohing one of the highest stations in
the transportation world.
Mr. Gardner was 57 years old, and
entered the service of the North West

Sinoe that time his advance has been
steady, stepping upward from one
grade to another until in 1910 he be
oame president, succeeding Marvin
Hughitt, who was made Chairman of
the Board of Directors, and retaining
all former activities and interests.
''Mr. Gardner's death is a shook to
as," said H. R. McCullough, vlce-pres
ident. "We thought a needed rest
would restore him to his usual activity.
Our intimacy and association has
tended baok to our early effimnl ser
vice and the entire organization, of
whioh he was ohief, are with his famity
in mourning."
"Mr. Gardner's oareer as a high of
ficial of the North Western waB mark
ed by intense loyalty on the part of
his subordinates," as stated by an of
ficer of the road. He was a strict
disciplinarian and an advocate of
highest effioienoy in every branch of
railroading. But under his direction a
spirit of general teamwork permeated
every department of the railroad."
He was essentially a bome-loving
man, and in his home he fou'

only interest outside his bubiuutse
deavors. The story of his rise in th«,
railroad world is not sensational ii in a
record of steady progress as a result of
ambition based on unflagging interest
in bis duties. Mr. Gardner often said,
•'I have always tried to be a good sub
ordinate—and a good subordinate is
pretty Bure to have good subordinates.''
Mr. Gardner was born et Gardner.

ODD NEWSPAPERS
Newspapers From Distant Lands—Oddities
of the Foreign Press
TheChamberlain Medioine Company,
Des Moines, Iowa, manufacturers of
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy, adver
tise not only in thia oountry but in
forign lands. A oopy of each issue of
every newspaper containing their ad
vertisements ia sent to the offioe of the
Chamberlain Medioine Company as a
proof of the insertion of the adver
tisement The Star is in receipt of a
bundle of them and some of the papers
bear names of plaoes, whioh require
one to recall forgotton geography or
refer to the atlas to locate. Some of
them are particularly curious as they
are published in the vernacular or
native languages whioh might be liken
ed to the carefully written notes of a
shorthand writer.
Here are the well known Chinese
characters arranged in vertical lines
reading from top to bottom, the lines
arranged from right to left.
The Burmese language, as printed is
composed principally of a combination
of oiroles. Some one wittily suggested
that for this reason circulars would be
properly printed in this language.
Cingalese, the language of Ceylon, is
also curvilinear. Javanese and Siamese
are composed largely of vertical lineB
oonneoted by loops at either top or
bottom but rarely at both. These
languages bear some resemblance to
the vertical writing now practiced in
our publio sohools.
The four hundred million people of
India have nearly fifty different dia
leots or vernaoulars. The Chamberlain
Medioine Company advertises in ten of
the principal onee as follows: Bengali,
Gujurathi, Hindi, Kanarese, Ma
layalam, Marathi, Sindhi, Tamil
Telegu and Urdu. The Sindhi and
Urdu are written from right to left in
the Hebrew fashion. The Urdu is a
sort of Bcript and is
BO
ohaotio in
shape that it is impossible to reduce it
to the movable type form. Papers
printed in the Urdu language are
therefore first written out by hand and
a plate made by the lithograph process'
The "Oudh Akhbar," a sixteen page
daily published at Luoknow in this
language, olaims a circulation of about
5,000. It is said that in order to handle
this circulation it requires an office
foroe of about 200. Fortunately for
the managers, the wages paid to natives
are only a few oentB a day.
The Chamberlain Medioine Company
advertise in newspapers printed in
thirty-two languages, Besides the
vernaoulars and the well known
European languages, Frenoh, Spanish,
Portuguese, Dutch, German, etc., the
list embraoes a number of languages
which until comparatively recent times
pos6ed no alphabet but for whioh the
Roman alphabet has been adopted.
Among these are the native Hawaiian,
Samoan, Tagalog (Philippine Islands).
Kaffir, Zulu and Basuto, of South
Africa. There is also a modern form
of the Malay language using Roman
characters, known as Romanized
Malay. This 1b used in Java and the
East Indies.
It is riiffioult to conceive how the
readers of some of the papers manage
to handle them. Imagine a man on
orowded street oar trying to read
paper whose pages are thirty-eight
inches long and twenty-nine inches
wide. Ibis is the size of the "Hitadabi,'
a Bengali weekly published in Cal
cutta, India. Some of the English
dailies published in South Africa, are
almost as unwedly, the pages of one
measuring twenty-seven and one-half
incb»s in length and twenty-five inches
in width.
To an American newspaper man it is
interesting to note the manner in
whioh the colonial English newspapers
are made up. They still cling to the
methods whioh were praotioed in this
oountry fifty years ago, the advertit-e
ments being upon the first few pages,
followed generally by the heavy editor
ials, then a few meager oable and tele
graphic
items, afterwards the local
news. The looal news consists prin-

$5,000,000 for the flsoal year ending
Jane, 1917, and increasing at the rate
of 1500,000,000 annually until and in

$167,500 the seoond year, $251,250 the
third year, $335,000 the fourth year,
and $418,750 the fifth year. Road im
provement is to be under the super
vision of the state highway department
and the state or any subdivisions there
of must expend an amount at least
equal to that contributed by the fede.
ral government for each project. The
state must also enter into an agree
ment that all roads to be constructed
under the provisions of the aot shall be
properly maintained for a peariod of
ten years. The bill passed substan
tially as drafted by the subcommittee,
of whioh Senator Sterling was a mem

special importance to South Dakota
provides that in states wher* the con

To the Tax Paters and Voters
As a candidate for the nomination

have been engaged in during the past
few years has brought me in touch
daily with the offioe of county treasur
er whioh I believe enables me, if nom
inated and elected, to oonduot the af
fairs of the office in a more effloient
and economical manner than one who
has had praotioally no experience along
these lines.
The tax payers can rest ussured that
eoonomy in office will be exercised to
the fullest extent of my ability.

EXTENSION WORK
Help Boost the County Extension Work by
Becoming A Member
Several enterprising farmers and
business men got together at Hot
Springs in June 1915 aud organized the
Fall River Oounty Agricultural Exten
tion Association, A charter'wbb duly is
sued by the Secretary of State. The
association now has over one hundred
members, and an active campaign is
being oonduoted for securing addition
al members.
The objeot of this association is to
promote better agricultural conditions
in Fall River oounty and to obtain
funds for engaging a oounty agrloul
tural agent. The servioes of a wide
awake effloient connty agent, who
understands conditions in western
Soath Dakota, will oost abont $2500.00
per year. Praotioally all of this money
can be obtained from publio funds,
V»
Vol. 31 No. 5
but a large membership to the associ
ation is desirable as some money must
be raised by the county organization
The board of County Commissioners
have appropriated 81000.00 for use of
the association during the ooming
year. For every dollar that the oounty
contributes the state will give sixty per
oent of that amount. In other word?,
$1000.00 having been appropriated by
the oounty commissioners, sixty per
oent of this amount will be available
from the state. In addition to these
sums the Federal Government
through the Department of Agricul
ture, will give SGOO 00 for this work.
It is possible that the latter appropri
ation cannot be obtained during the
current year because the Federal funds
are nearly exhausted. It is important
that the looal organization be perfect
ed as Boon as possible so that an ef
fort may be made to obtain these
rands.
A oonnty agent would spend all of
his time organizing clubs, giving ad
vioe to farmers and working for in
creased profitableness in farming.
Suoh an agent would have an except
ional opportunity in Fall River oounty.
Prom the Experiment Farm at Ard
more he could obtain the results of
the extensive experiments of that
station for the information of the farm
ers of this county. The Experiment
Farm, however, should not be oonfus
ed with the extension servioe of the
oounty agent. The two lines of work
would be entirely distinct and sepe
rate. but the offioials of the farm and
the oounty agent doubtless would co
operate to advantage.
It is to be hoped that all of our looal
farmers and business men will get be
hind this movemeut and give it the
support whioh it deserves. It 1B of
great importance to the farming in
terests of the oouuty and should re
