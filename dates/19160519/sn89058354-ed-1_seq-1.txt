The Parisian Interviews Mer
chants As To Business
All Smiling
Every business firm in Paris
reports record-breaking "sales
Saturday. Some declare that it
was the best day in twelve
months and many say that they
did a bigger business than upon
any other day since Christmas
ee. One or two of the new
firms declare that they sold more
goods than upon any other day
' siriceHhey opened.
Prosperity has returned to Paris
fT2id Henry county. Hard times
are aihing of the past. This is
- evidenced by Saturday's busi-
ness, which was not confined to
any one line of business but
reached every firm. Grocers,
dry goods merchants, clothi ers,
hardware storesjewelers, drug
gists and in fact everybody re
ports a great day.
Just as the big sales were not
confined to any certain lines of
business, the customers were
not of any particular clas3 of
people. While the railroad em
ployes were in evidence about
the stores Saturday night, the
pay-car having run that day, a
large number of people "from the
rural sections also did much buy
ing. The extra day's work that the
railroad boys are now getting
each week seemed to stimulate
business, while the farmers
seemed more willing to turn loose
their money than formerly.
Everybody is apparently con
vinced that the "close money"
period has ended and that pros
perity in big chunks is again
with us.
Saturday's big business will
compare very, very favorably
with business one year ago. At
- thatjtime business was at a stand
still and people were buying only
what was absolutely required.
In an effort to ascertain wheth
er or not the business was good

STATE SCHOOL CHIEF
ANNOUNCES IMPORTANT
EXAMINATION CHANGES
County Superintendent Routon
Receives Letter From
S.W.Sherrill
TEACHERS MA f TAKE TESTS
WHEN MAY EXAMS ARE HELD
Schedule For Examination To
Be Sent Superintendent
Routon In Few Days
County Superintendent of Ed
ucation Joe Routon is in receipt
of a letter from S. W. Sherrill,
state superintendent, announcing
some important changes in the
coming May examinations for
teachers. This announcement
will prove of interest to teachers
throughout Henry county.
The letter is self explanatory
and is given in full below:
"In order that our school teach
ers may be able to obtain certifi
cates on the several different
subjects they may wish to teach,
we have arranged to make a cer
tificate on some of the subjects
of several of the groups. I am
sure this will be quite a conven
ience to a number of high school
teachers. In many of our coun
ties they are establising a third
class or two year high schools to
take the place of the old second
ary school. Teachers in these
schools will need certificates on
several different groups. By
taking this group they may re
ceive a certificate that will thus
enable them to teach in such
schools. I hope you will notify
your teachers of this so that all
who may wish may take this
group in the May examination.
The group is as follows:
"Subjects required: spelling,
grammar, rhetoric, arithmetic,
algebra, general history and
biology.
"Applicants may elect such
other subjects as may be desired.
"Please announce that all of
the elementary subjects will be
given in the next examination

tire car of the Booster train has'
been engaged by Louisville stock
people who desire to meet stock
dealers and stock raisers of this
section.
The Boosters will be accom
panied by a band and a staff of
newspaper men.
About an hour will be spent
by tire Boosters in Paris. They
will arrive in McKenzie at 12:05
p. m., where a large crowd is
also expected to greet them.
They come from Clarksville to
Paris.

Rev. Spaulding preached at
Friendship Sunday morning and
was on his way to the county
home, where he was to deliver
a sermon, when he stopped to
water his horse. Getting out of
his buggy, he led the horse dorn
to the water and when the
animal had finished drinking
started to lead him out. Sudden
ly the horse jumped. Rev.
Spaulding was thrown into the
ditch and the horse fell in upon
him. Being hitched to the bug

move. Rev. Spaulding shouted

exhausted, and finally got his
knife from the pocket of his coat
and commenced to cut the har
ness from the horse. When he
had completed this task the
animal was able to move about
sufficiently to allow Rev. Spauld
ing to escape. The man fell,
exhausted, to the ground. A
few minutes later Will Lee hap
pened along and found man and
animal.
Lee summoned help and after
Rev. Spaulding had regained his
strength to a certain extent, the
horse was dug out of the hole.
It is considered miraculous that
Rev. Spaulding was nol killed in
the accident. However, he was
unhurt, although pinned beneath
the horse for nearly thirty
minutes.
Women and Girls
Again Victorious
Margin Is Small
By a margin of only 126 points
the women and girls took another
of the series of contests from the
men and boys at the First Chris
tian Bible School last Sunday.
Both sides worked hard and the
attendance was large. An effort
is being made to have at least
250 in attendance next Sunday.
The women and girls have won
two Sundays out of three, and
the contest has two Sundays yet
to run-unless the women and
girls should win again Sunday.

the sausage and exchanged same
for the sulphur desired, while the
new clerk probably received a
little talk from the proprietor of

AUGUST 3; RUN-OFF LATER
Browning, Lyon and Terry Are
Only Announced Candi
dates for House
With the Democratic state con
vention a thing of the past, the
race for Representative will pro
bably next hold the attention of
local politicians. Three candi
dates, T.J. Browning, R. W. Lyon
and R. M. Terry, are already in
the field and quite a number of
other Democrats have been sug
gested. The general belief is that when
the contestants go to the post in
the primary on August 3 that
there will be a full field pro
bably six or seven.
When the county committee
called the primary for August 3
and the run-off for August 19,
it also named a primary com
mittee of seven members, which
is to have charge of the primary.
This committee has not yet or
ganized, but will likely do so in
the near future. At the same
time that organization is effected,
the committee will likely provide
rules and regulations for the
primary and set a date for quali

NAME COMMITTEE TO RAISE
FUNDS FOR BOYS DORMI TORY
Prof. Rob inson, Col. Barton,
Rev. Lavender and Others
Talk At Meeting
By a rising vote that was
unanimous the mass meeting of
citizens held at the courthouse
Saturday afternoon decided to
name a committee to go before
the county court and urge that a
special school tax of 5 cents be
levied for the support of the
Grove High School.
This action was taken upon
motion of Col. 0. C. Barton, who
also moved that a committee be
appointed to solicit funds for the
erection of a boys dormitory at
Grove and for repairs on the
building. This motion was also
adopted unanimously. ,
The mass meeting, of which
Dr. G. L. Powers was chairman
and County Superintendent Joe
Routon secretary, and which was
held in conjunction with a meet
ing of the joint boards of the
Grove school, heard some inter
esting talks from Prof. W. T.
Robinson, Dr. E. A. Travis, W.
C. Johnson, Rev. B B. Laven
der, Rev. B. F. Smith, Col. 0. C.
Barton, J. M. Porter and others.
The committee named to put
the question of a special 5 cent
school tax up to the county court
is composed of John D. Atkins,
J. W. Tyson, Will M. Huddle
ston, A. G. Alexander, J. T.
Porter. W. R. Walters and Dr.
E. A. Travis.
The committee to raise funds
for the erection of a dormitory
and for the repairs is composed
of W. C. Johnson, Joe Routon,
Dr. E. A. Travis, J. M. Porter,
Capt. J. W. Travis, W. R. Lasa
ter and C. P. Hudson.
The total cost of the proposed
dormitory for boys will be
$13,500, which is considerably
less than was at first expected
and the costs of the repairs that
are proposed is $3,356, making a
total of $16,856.
The committee expects to have
little difficulty in raising the
