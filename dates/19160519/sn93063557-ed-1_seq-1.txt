o'clock to aeo what nctlon, if nny

Middlebury Marblo compnny to uso
thoirtractor encino on tho hlgliway
for tho carrylnK of marblo an:l supplicp
from thoir quarry in tho enst pnrt of
tho town to tho freicht atntion. It ia
loped to get an expreasion of opinion
at this meeting which will justify tho
seloctmon to nllow tho compnny to con-
tinuo to operato tho tructor on the
highway as hofore und under tho same
conditions. This meeting is called by
tho executivo committeo of tho bonrd
of trade for tho purpose of giving tho
voters a chnnce to express thelr opin
ion. Tho compnny has in its employ
about 20 men with the probabllity that
the number will be increased from time
to time. Seloctman Cady, who is also
county road commiasioner, is said to be
in favor of tho proposition, to allow tho
compnny to continuc tho use of the
trnctor, while the other two membcrs
of the board are said to be opposed to
the permit. Thoro scems to bo a gen-
eral feeling among tho business men in
Middlebury that tho marblo compnny be
pennitted to continuo the use of the
tractor on the highway between the
quarry and tho freight station without
infringing on the rights of the people
who use the highway. It is hoped that
th meeting will be largely attended in
order to get a full expression of opinion
as to the advisability of continuing the
permit for nnother term,
