The seventeenth annual meeting of
the Second District Federation of
Women's clubs has just been brought
to a successful close in Caldwell.
The ladies were met and escorted
to their various stopping places by
committees of the Forward club.
The sessions opened Monday even
ing in the beautifully decorated club
rooms of the Forward club. The ad
dress of welcome by the president,
Mrs. Bryan, was enthusiastically re
ceived by the Federation and warmly
responded to.
The meetings were very enjoyable
throughout, even the business sessions
being carried on with despatch despite
the interspercing of friendyl argument.
Some of the important things dis
cussed were, of course, <he educational
and social reform work. This was
made much more interesting and clear
to the ladies by the enjoyable talks of
Dr. Sisson, commissioner of education.
To everyone, delegates and visitors
alike, the most enjoyable feature of
teh program was the detailed reports
of the various clubs. In them, many
of them witty, clever sketches of club
life, was brought out the good work
of the clubs, and the civic help to the
community. This in different cities
and towns.
On Tuesday evening the Federation
after a dinner served by the domestic
science class of the College of Idaho
at Finney Hall, adjourned to the M.
E. church for the evening session. Be
fore the regular work was taken up,
the ladies listened to a very delightful
organ recital by Frederic Fleming
Çeale. The rest of the evening was
taken up by well written papers, dis
cussing the American woman in poli
tics, business, art, literature, music, so
cial reform. These all showed careful
thought and study and were well re
ceived.
At the last session Wednesday offi
cers were elected for the ensuing year.
While it has been several years since
the Federation was entertained here,
yet club spirit has not abated and all
felt that a most enjoyable time was
had by both visiting and local ladies.
The hearty co-operation of all the
town people helped to make things
pleasant and the able assistance of our
musical artists proved invaluable.
Two important changes were made
in the constitution ajid by-laws. The
dues were raised from five to 10 cents
per capita yearly, and the district
loan scholarship was abolished. The
decision to pay the railroad fare of
the president and secretary to and
from the annual federation meetings
and of the president to the biennial
state meetings, and the printing of
the resolutions in order to send
copy to each club, made necessary a
larger income for the federation, so
the dues were raised.
The district loan scholarship, which
was raised to loan to students who
wished to attend either of the two
normals or the Technical institute, the
state loan scholarship loaning only to
University of Idaho students, had
proved too small to be of benefit, and
it was voted to abolish the scholar
ship, and return the money to the
clubs which had donated funds lo it.
Back Sawtooth Park.
After hearing a wonderfully alluring
paper on the proposed Sawtooth na
tional park, written and read by Mrs
W. E. Gracey, who had lived for sev
eral years within the boundaries of
the proposed park, the clubwomen
voted to ask Senator Borah to con
tinue working for the present bill, with
the enlarged boundaries, which is now
before congress. So strong were the
pleas made for the future greatness of
the park that it was felt the enlarged
boundaries were almost a necessity.
Previously letters had been sent to
the senator by individual clubs asking
him to restrict the boundaries in order
to leave the grazing land within the
jurisdiction of the forest reserve in
stead of the department of the interior
as it would be if in the confines of the
park.
The federation unanimously
dorsed the administration of the state
educational commission and the pro
posed legislative measures which the
commision is planning to submit to
the coming legislature. •
In her report, as chairman of the
legislative committee, Mrs. J. G. rl
Graveley asked permission to intro
duce Dr. E. O. Sisson. commissioner
of education, who would explain two
measures in which she felt sure the
clubwomen would be interested.
Explains School Tax Levy.
Dr. Sisson explained the school tax
levy, by which it was hoped to rat se
one-third of the school revenue. This
levy, he explained, would take more
from some counties than it would give
back, but it would give more to some
counties than they were assessed, thus
helping to equalize the money to be
given Tor school purposes and elimin
ate the present condition, where dis
tricts witn only a few children had
large sums per capita and others not
enough to even furnish a six months'
school yearly. Idaho, by passing this
levy, Dr. Sisson said, would lower its
taxes, by getting more money easily.
1 he commission will also ask for an
appropriation to introduce health
work into the public schools. The
speaker then mentioned the number
of feeble minded in the state, explain
ing that owing to there being no eu
genics marriage law, this number is
increasing rapidly. He displayed charts
showing the scientific presentation of
heredity among the feeble minded, and
also showed the result of the Binet
test at the state industrial school,
which proved that 25 per cent of the
201 inmates were mentally defective.
Got All Mixed Up.
The discussion on the resolution
urging the next legislature to make an
appropriation to finish and equip the
state institution for feeble minded,
which is now only partially finished,
created much merriment. It came
toward the close of the session when
the women were tired by -strenuous
work and some found their tongues
twisted, parliamentary rules were mix
ed and there was general confusion.
Finally one woman said, "Madam
President, I move this resolution be
adopted that we may all have a place
to go," and as the president put the
motion, she said, "Well, we'll be in
good company, any way."
The wiomen felt, putting all joking
aside, that this was one of the most
Important measures which would be
before the next legislature.
Mrs. Graveley, in discussing the
women's legislative work of the last
session, said that the last legislature
was the kindest of all in its treatment
of the clubwomen's bills.
"It is true," she said, "that our bill
amending the divorce law never was
heard from, but then, the Boise law
yers said that had it passed it would
Have removed one of the best indus
tries of the capital, and the civil ser
vice bill is still sleeping, but we did
get permission to spend our own earn
ngs, to make our own wills without
any one's having to look on, to guard
our own children, and a number of
other much sought privileges, so we
feel extremely grateful in the Thir
tentli session."
It was vjted to assist the other dis
tricts and the slate federation in pay
ing some person to watch and report
on the women's bills at the next leg
islative session.
The symposium of standing com
mittees, led by Mrs. H. D. Blatchley
of this city, in which the department
chairman gave suggestions for solv
ing problems of the committees and
of new methods, proved highly profit
able. Mrs. C. 0. Brach, chairman of
the music committee, urged the es
tablishment of a band and chorus in
every town and that more interest be
taken by the adults in the music of
the public school.

10. CHRISTOPHER CUISUHE
DOWN AUTHORS OE
LIBEL AGAINST HIM
The Van Deusen audit has thus far
produced $2.91 and at a cost of upward
of $2500.00, The State Bank of Mid
dleton has sent in the first named
amount to cover a shortage claimed
by Canyon county and shown to exist
by the Van Deusen report.
A Payette Valley paper, basing its
statements on information furnished
by County Attorney H. A. Griffiths,
stated last week that Assessor Chris
topher had turned into the county
treasury about $2600.00, which sum it
was represented was a portion of an
alleged shortage in the assessor's of
fice. Whe.ii the article in question was
called to the attention of Mr. Chris
topher, he immediately declared his
intention of filing suit for libel against
the newspaper unless due and ample
retraction were made at once. The pa
per promised to make the retraction.
The paper in question, the Fruitland
Banner, states that the information
was furnished by County Attorney
Griffiths. Mr: Griffiths denies that he
made any statement of the kind to ihc
publisher of the newspaper.
Mr. Christopher has devoted much
of his spare time recently to checking
over items of the Van Deusen report
which were listed as "shortages" in
his balances. He states that numer
ous errors have been found, including
a large double entry of the same
amount made by a deputy who was
noted for his painstaking care. The
assessor promises some interesting
disclosures when he makes a written
report to the commissioners.
Badley Wants Light.
It is stated that former Recorder
Badley, against whom the county com
missioners believe they have claims
approaching $400 in amount, has
written from his home in Portland to
ask for details of the statement made
out against him. He has also indi
cated that he will endeavor to have
someone check over the items care
fully before accepting the auditor's
findings as correct.
If the county commissioners are in
clined to lake legal steps in an effort
to collect from the other former offi
cers from whom smaller balances are
claimed to be due, there is ample evi
dence that they'will have the oppor
tunity to do so.

^iss Edith Stovel, Valedictorian.
Miss Edith Stovel, valedictorian of
the Class of 1916, is one of the most

people in the city. From Chicago they

abstract business in Caldwell, which
business lie ran until his election to
the office of county auditor. For four
years Mr. Stovel was county auditor,

ably known to a host of friends all
through the county.
Miss Stovel entered school here and
has a consistent record as a faithful,
as well as brilliant, student. Last year
she served as Editor-in-chief of the
Pow Wow, the high school annual,
which office she discharged with honor
and credit to all concerned.
Tile honor conferred upon her this
year came as a complete surprise to
iier, and a gratification to the many
friends and classmates.

the benefit of the children.
SCHOOL PUPILS DO
PRACTICAL HANDICRAFT
The annual display of industrial
work done by pupils in all grades of
the Caldwell schools the past year was
made at the high school building the
latter part of last week. Included in
the exhibition were specimens of do
mestic science, manual training, agri
cultural and general handicraft work
Large numbers of visitors viewed and
admired the exhibits durihg afternoon
and evening of both days.
In the domestic science room, now
quite fully equipped and modernly ar
ranged, largely through the craftman
ship of boys of the manual training
department were arranged many spec
imens of culinary skill. The practical
side of the training the embryo cooks
had received was emphasized by ac
companying placards stating the food
value of the dish, or the purpose for
which it should be used.
Work in Concrete.
Features to be seen in the agricul
ture classroom worthy of particular
note were a model concrete silo built
entirely by the boys, and an iron and
concrete cattle stanchion.
In the gymnasium was arranged, in
tasty manner, pieces of furniture made
by the manual training classes, sam
pies of sewing fabricated by the girls
and specimens of the handcraft work
done by both boys and girls in the
grades of all the various buildings
The exhibits were admirably assem
bled. The outstanding feature em
phasized throughout was the practical
nature of the work being done by the
students.
In insisting that the pupils be taught
to make articles 'which are useful In
the home. Superintendent Clifford is
making a big advance over the old
systems, in which utility of the arti
clcs on which the children employed
their time was not considered.
Pupils Improve Buildings.
Another commendable feature is the
fact that in the Caldwell schools the
industrial work is begun in the lowest
grades and continued throughout the
entire course. Largely because of the
fact for instance, that boys of every
class in the high school do manual
training work, it was possible to show
the visitor innumerable carpentry im
provements about the high school
buildings which have been wrought
by the workers in the course of their
regular exercises.

M'CLUSKY DID NOT PRESENT
PETITION FOR DISTRICT
Error in Tribune Report of Water
Users' Meeting.
In its account of the meeting of the
iard of directors of the Boise Water
Users' association published in The
Tribune of last week, an error was
liade. The Tribune said:
"Petitions signed by 62 settlers were
resented to the board by Messrs.
William McCluckey and Harry N'.
Wood asking that the Water Users'
issociation be converted into an ir
rigation d'strict. Mr. Wood took oc
casion to say that the attitude of the
settlers toward the irrigation district
had been misrepresented. I.n substan
iatioi# of his statement he presented
his petition with 50 signatures. There
are upwards of 2000 settlers on the
Boise project. Mr. McCluskey, who
has been employed by Mr. B. E. Stou
tcmyer, counsel for the Reclamation
Service, presented a petition with 10
signatures. A third petition was pre
sented with 2 signatures."
Mr. McCluskey states that he signed
a petition for an irrigation district but
neither signed nor presented to the
board such a petition. He states that
his time is fully occupied in caring for
three ranches and that he has no time
to devote to circulating petitions.
The Tribune is pleased to make this
correction.
