Raising Road Funds by
Bond Issue
Benefits from Good Roads Cannot Be Over
esttmated-Necessity for Expert Superviion
(Prepared by the U. S. Department of Agriculturel
S .
...."..: '
Using Drag, Dunn, North Carolina.
Of the various methods of financing
road projects the one most generally
practiced for raising a substantial fund
which will be available for immediate
expenditure is through the issuance of
bonds. Experience, say the road spe
cialists of the department, has shown
good roads to be a sound investment,
both from a business and economic
standpoint. If properly proportioned
and managed bond issues are made for
their improvement, the roads them
selves will pay off the indebtedness
thus created through the utility which
they afford and the saving which will
result in the cost of hauling.
Some Reasons fcr Failure.
Instances are not lacking where
bond issues for highway purposes
have proved failures. These failures
are due to mismanagement rather than
to detective principle. Where coun
ties have issued highway bonds the
proceeds of which have been spent
to construct temporary road surfaces
Laying First Course, Poplar Springs Road, Meridian, Mississippi.
on unimproved grades and without
proper drainage, failure has neces
sarily resulted. There are on record in
the department of agriculture instances
showing where the so-called macad
am roads have been built with
bond money by simply dumping
broken stone at the wrong time of
year on muddy surfaces without
grades or alignments and without roll
ing or binding. Investment of money
in new roads does not become real
economy until provision is made for
keeping these new roads in condition
by maintenance and repair after they
are built.
Through a misunderstanding of the
essential principles underlying the es
tablishment of a proper country road
system, conflicts of interest sometime
arise which cause the failure of the
bond-issue plan. The location of the
roads to be improved should not be
determined by argument, but upon
sound engineering and economic prin
ciples. Before a community votes to
issue bonds for highways it is neces
sary to study thoroughly what roads
ought to be improved, and the ap
proximate cost of their construction

and maintenance. Too frequently ill
advised locations are adopted.
Need for Highway Engineers.
Highway plans for bond issues re
quire expert skill and professional
service. Before the amount of bonds
is determined, a thorough study of
the needs of the county should be
made and careful maps of the pro
posed highway system should be pre
pared. The sum to be issued should
not be fixed until it is reasonably
known what it will accomplish. It is
customary for many counties to ap
point a commission of business men
under whose jurisdiction the bond
money is expended. In other cases
the county supervisor or county com
missioner has the direction of expendi
tures. The best results have always
followed where such commissions or
county boards have secured the serv
ices of a competent highway en
gineer.
Guided by the costly experience of
many communities, it is now becoming
common for counties to adopt this
plan. In all engineering construction
it is customary to allow a certain per
centage of the cost for engineering
and supervision. There is no reason
why highway building should be made
an exception to this rule. At least
five per cent of the bond issue may
well be set aside for engineering and
supervision alone. Money spent to
hire a competent engineer to make pre
liminary investigations before bonds
are issued and to plan and supervise
construction will be well spent. It
is not uncommon to And counties that
will repeatedly postpone the sale of
bonds in order to obtain an increase
of one per cent in a bid for $100,000
or less and then proceed to construct
the roads in a most haphazard and ll
planned manner.
The split log drag has contributed
more toward the economic mainte
nance of public highways than any
implement of modern usage. A drag
can be built or purchased for $20 and
is easily operated by anyone who can
drive a team.
