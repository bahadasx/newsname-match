formerly pastor of the Christian
church, of which Mr. Crawford was
a member.
Leonard Crawford was born in
Ohio on January 27, 1829, his par
ents being James and Phoebe Craw
ford. He resided in Ohio until 17
years of age, then accompanied his
family to Jefferson county, Wiscon
sin, and several years later to Fay
ette county, lowa, where for a num
ber of years he followed the dual oc
cupation of farming and running a
sawmill. He was one of the earliest
settlers in thai county. In 1867 he
removed to Missouri, going thence to
Kansas in 1871, where he resided
until 187G, when he answered the
rail of the West and came across the
plains by team. Mr. Crawford was
in Cheyenne at the time of the toted
Custer massacre. He continued his
westward journey until he reached
Whitman county, and settled on a
quarter section just east of the pres
ent city of Pullman, which now com
prises the city ball park.
Later he sold this quarter section
and purchased a farm three miles
northeast of Pullman, where he re
sided until he moved to Pullman l')
years ago.
.Mr. Crawford was married in Wis
consin on January 1, 1852, to .Miss
Lydie Sweet, who died in Kansas
after having become the mother of
seven children. On August 11. 187 1,
two years before starting West, in
contracted a second marriage, tin
lady being Mrs. Mary A. Brown, who
proved a loving wife and helpful
companion during the entire forty
years of their residence near Pull
man, passing away only last month.
A public-spirited benevolently dis
posed man, Mr. Crawford, until age
bore too heavily on his shoulders,
always took an active interest in lo
cal affairs as well as in the political
concerns of the county and state, lie
was a lifelong democrat, and was a
Party leader during Pullman's early
days. He came to Pullman, then nil
located and unnamed, at a time vvnen
a vast carpet of bunchgrass and
weeds covered the area which is now
the greatest farming land in the
world. From the very start he had
great faith in the future of Eastern
Washington and Whitman county in
Particular, and was a factor for good
in the early development of Pullman
and the entire county.
Mr. Crawford was a firm believer
111 thorough horses, and Instead
of using the cayuses typical of the
early days of this county, import-id
a number of thoroughbred Cly lea
ses for his own use and for the
benefit of his scattered neighbors.
He fathered and fostered the move
ment for better horseflesh in Whit
man county.
Mr. Crawford's great-grandfather

Diplomas
Impressive exercises marked ihe
annual commencement of the Pull
man high school this week, when 20
members of the Senior class were
awarded diplomas signifying that
they have completed the courses pre
scribed for accredited high school
work.
Commencement exercises pro.i ir
were held Wednesday evening in the
college auditorium, when the gradu
ates were addressed by Dr. Bruce
AlcCully, head of the department of
Knglish, who spoke words of wisdom
and caution which will prove highly
valuable to the young ladies and
young men who are just entering
upon their higher educational pur
suits. 'The School and the Present
Crisis'' whs the subject selected by
the speaker and lie delivered his mes^-
sage to the graduates in a forceful,
understandable way. The diplomas
to the members of the class were pre
sented by 11. F. Campbell, president
of the board of directors, and music
was furnished by the high school or
chestra and the girls' glee club. Miss
Rosa Funfslnn favored the audience
with ii well rendered solo and the
.Misses Irene Jinnett and Kay Liv
ingston gat a vocal duet.
The i lass exercises were held Mon
day evening in the high school audi
torium, the song contest being won
by the Sophomore class. Jervis Ful
mer, who was highest in his class
in scholastic standing, gave the vale
dictory address, and Miss Doris
Stephenson, second highest, was sa
lutatorian. The class history was
read by Glenn Kellogg, I lie class will
by Mary Sanders and the prophecy
by Harold Henry.
Sunday evening, in the Presbyter
ian church, the sermon to the class
was delivered by the Rev, J. G. Rob
inson, of the Episcopal church. The
subject was "Quit Yourselves Like
Men," and the sermon was one of
the best ever given before a local
high school graduating class.
Nearly the entire class, the mem
bers of which were given in last
week's Herald, will enroll at the
State College next fall, some few still
being uncertain as to whether or not
they can continue their studies fur
ther.

NUMBER 31
FEMALE JURY ACQUITS
I FEMALE DEFENDANT
Siv Pullman Woman Sit on Caaa In
tuiting Wbcliin Women—
anil Hal tor) Was Charged
Pullman's lirst female Jury, sitting
on probably the lirst case In tlie local
cunts in which one woman was ac
cused of assault and battery on an
other, Tuesday afternoon returned a
verdict of "not guilty' in favor of
Mrs. Daisy Whitford, who was charg
ed with third degree assault and bat
tery upon the person of .Mrs. .Naoma
Thomas, Both the principals in the
case reside at Whelan, and are close
neighbors, but came to strenuous
blows as a result of differences over
neighborhood matters and the com
plaining witness was brought to Pull
man for medical repairs, later caus
ing „ warrant to be issued for the
arrest of her alleged "assailant."
The case was tried before Justice
of the Peace George N. Henry, with
Prosecuting Attorney it. M. Burgun
dc-r in charge of the case for the
state and John W. Mattews appear
ing as legal council for the defend
ant. The unusual character of the
ease attracted a capacity crowd of
court fans to the city hall, a large
percentage of the eager listeners be-
Ing women.
By mutual consent a jury of six
Pullman women was selected to sit
on the case, the jury including Mrs.
.1. ii. Sanborn, Mrs. 10. Maguire, .Mrs.
K.O. Cart heart, Mrs. L. R, Miller, Mrs.
W. C. Kruegel and Mrs. A. I-;. Egge.
Two hours was consumed in prelim
inaries and in the taking of testi
mony, after which the jurors retired
to privacy, voted, and Immediately
returned a verdict of acquittal.
Each of the principals to the fistic
encounter claimed that the other bad
struck the first blow, and the- lack of
eye-witnesses to the combat made the
case a complicated one. Mrs. Whit
ford, the defendant, claimed that she
chased one of Mrs. Thomas' cows
from her garden, and that a few min
utes later, when she- went to the de
pot to take the train for Pullman,
he found Mrs. Thomas waiting for
her in the depot door. The defend
ant alleged that Mrs. Thomas was
insulting in her remarks, and ac
cused her of stealing a pair of rub
bers belonging to Mrs. Thomas. She
stated thai Mrs. Thomas warned her
to keep out of the depot and that
when sin- started in Mrs. Thomas
tore a hair switch from her head
and attempted to hit her with a stick
or piece of iron. This, she claimed,
started the fistic battle which re
sulted in a severe scalp wound, re
quiring several stitches, together
with several cuts and bruises and a
black eye for the complaining wit
ness.
The story told by Mrs. Thomas dif
fered but little from that told by
the defendant except as to the man
ner in which the fight was started.
She claimed that Mrs. Whitford pro
voked the encounter and struck the
first blow, and that she suffered se
vere injuries from a "weapon" in the
hands of Mrs. Whitford, although
there was some- diversity of opinion
as to whether the alleged 'weapon
was a railroad spike- or a piece of
wood. -Mrs. Thomas Stated that the
two women, while neighbors, had not
spoken for six months.
Several witnesses were called, but
the lack of direct evidence of Illegal
Intent on the part of the defendant
resulted In the verdict of acquittal
by the female jury.
LOWER COURT SUSTAINED
M. S. Jamar, attorney for Mrs. Ida
(Haze, this week received notlCte that
the supreme court had sustained the
judgment of the superior court in
the case of Ida Glaze vs. the Pull
man State bank, in which Mrs. Glaze
asked a permanent injunction to pro
hibit the bank from selling her sep
arate property on a judgment against
her husband, H. A. Glaze. The su
preme court perpetually enjoined the
bank from selling the property.
The lower court was also sustain
ed in the case of the Harry L. Olive
Co. vs. Vi Meek, brought several
month! ago in the superior court by
Mr. Olive to recover on a note for
j $:1000, given by Abe Reed and en
' dorsed by Mr. Meek. The Judgment
