COMMUMCATED
Mr. Mitchell Withdraws.
To the Voters of the First Congressional
District
When I announced my candidacy for
Congress, I was reasonably sure that I
would be the only candidate for the
office from my own county. Later,
when Mr. Rankin, also from Lee
County, entered the race, I proposed
to him to leave it to a primary elec
tion in our home county to determine
which one of us should make the race
and he refused to do so. Since that
time Mr. Cunningham, from Prentiss
Couuty. has entered the race. Consid
ering the advantage given to the other
two contestants, Messrs. Candler and
Cunningham, on account of the divi
sion in my home county, I have de
cided to withdraw from the race, and,
in doing so, I wish to express my ap
preciation to those who have promised
me their support and to assure them
that I shall always feel deeply indebted
to them for their loyalty to my cause.

The Troubles of Germany
Whether or not you feel sym
pathy with Germany in the pres
ent crisis, you cannot withhold
from it admiration for the courage
and the spirit with which it faces
the . difficulties that beset it.
AKide 'froni the ftwfnl sacrifices, of
life in battle, virtually all of its
troubles and they aie very serious,
are of an economic nature.
Germany suffers greatly from
the closing of its ports to com
merce. It is hemmed in. Before
the war it had a merchant marine
of more than three million tons,
nine-tenths of which was North
Sea tonuage and one tenth Baltic
tonnage. All of that nine-tenths
has perforce l:iin idle during the
last twenty one months. The
enemy has seized some of it, a
good deal is laid up in neutral
ports until the end of the war and
the rest is shut up in German
harbors. None of it ventures to
mit tn sea. The foreign commerce
of the empire which, combining
exports and imports, nau a vaiue
of more than live billion dollars in
U)13, does not now amount to one
twentieth of that sum.
That means, in the first place,
that the impoitation of food has
diminished so greatly that it may
be said to have ceased. That the
empire has contrived to do with
out the one billion seven hundred
million dollars' worth of agricul
tural products and iooustults nil
nnr ted in I'lU sneaks well for its
ingenuity, thrift and self re
straint; but there is abundant
evidence in the government regu
lation of the supply, sale, price
and consumption of food that the
loss is important and hard to en
dure. Furthermore, scarcity
causes high prices.
AVe are told aitnougn it is
hard to believe - that German
mon of science have found prac
ticable substitutes for copper, rub
her and other articles uiau arc
used in enormous quantities in
war. The importation of cotton
has ceased altogether; the govcrn
.nnnr h:iq till-en all the available
stock on hand to make guncotton,
and the factories have none w
spin and no yarn to weave.
Moreover, there is no export,
fT-n,l floininiiv had built up
a great traffic in a thousand kinds
of manufactured goods, anu nau
gained an enviable reputation for
excellent work. To mention
hnuim'v nnd knit f'oods. cutlery,
drugs, gloves and dyestuffs hardly
begins to suggest the almost end
io vnrier.v of things that Ger
many was exporting before the
war. The trade is gou.e.

It is much too early to specu
late on the consequences of the
vast public debt that Germany,
like the othd' warring nations, is
piling up. The fact, however,
that the people are taking the
loans and that the government is
spending the money at home miti
gates the evil. The system on
which Germany is managing its
finances is not unlike that which
the United States adopted during
the civil war. Although our debt
in 18G5 was huge, we reduced it in
a few years to manageable propor
tions. It is important to remem
ber that no nation has ever been
conquered through lack of money
or through tailure of its linances;
and we may be sure that Ger
many will not be the first to suf
fer that fate.
Stand by the President
Mr Taft's plea for elimination
nf nnlitieal nprsnnalities in the
crisis in foreign affairs, and for
the rally of all good citizens, re
gardless of party, to the side of
tha Prpnidpnr. in the issue with
the government at Berlin, reads
a wholesome lesson in American
patriotism.
Mr. Taft's attitude furnishes a
timely example of the courtesy
that is becoming, from a former
President of the United States to
his successor in oflice. It offers
a fitting rebuke to such narrow
minded partisanship as that of
Congressman Mann of Illinois,
and Senator Sherman of the
same state, who appear to con
sider the present situation as an
occasion to try to make political
capital for their party out of one
of the gravest ideals in inter
national relations, - with which
this country has ever been con
fronted. National Monthly.
"Today the remnant of the
armies of the Confederate states
of America does hereby offer
herself, its sons and its proper
ty upon the altar of a re-united
country which we love and seek
to serve, protect and defend."
While long on patriotism the
above from the Birmingham
resolutions is sure some short on
grammar. Though to use three
pronouns for one subject, in one
sentence, is ouite a linuuislie
feat. Vicksburg Herald.

Hughes, Roosevelt and the
Chicago Convention
The New York Tribune has
formnH'y endes Roosevelt for
the Republican nomination at
Chicago. The Tribune is often
called the leading Republican
newspaper in the United States.
No newspaper fought Roosevelt
harder in 1912 than did the Tri
bune. But either it fancies it
sees in him the Republican
chance, or it thinks best to anti
cipate what it regards as the
probable action of the Chicago
convention.
On the other hand, a canvass
lately taken of the Republicans
in the House of Representatives,
gives Hughes a long lead over
Roosevelt as the probable choice
at Chicago. The figures of the
poll are as follows: Hughes,
sixty-two; Roosevelt, ten; Bur
ton, eleven; Cummins, eleven;
Sherman, six; Fairbanks, two;
Weeks, two; Root, one; Knox,
one; non-committal, sixty.
A similar line-up of the Senate
Republicans gave the following
results: Hughes, seven; Roose
velt, one; Cummins, two; non
committal, twenty-two.
These figures are given for
what they are worth. On the
face of them they cannot be said
to represent the probable relative
convention strength of the vari
ous names specified. But they
are interesting, particularly as
showing how many Republicans
in Congress believe Huyhes will
be nominated at Chicago.
Another development which
has caused a good deal of com
ment is Senator Works' criticism
of Republicans who wish to bring
Hughes into the arena.
Take it all around, the circum
stances show that no man can
predict with reasonable certain
ty, precisely what the outcome
at Chicago will be. But there is
no question that notwithstanding
the slight showing for Roosevelt
among the Republicans in Con
gress, and the opposition to
Hughes, typified by the Works
statement and the failure of the
Tribune to endoise the Justice
and former Governor, Hughes
and Roosevelt are the two men
most considered for the Republi
can Presidential t.omination.

Monotonous Goodness
An evangelist who has been con
ducting a revival in New Orleans
recently paid what he thought
was a very high tribute to the
beautiful littlo town of Blue
Mountain in this state, lie de
clared that Blue Mountain has a
population cf more than one thou-
saud persons, and there is not a
woman in the community who
plays cards or goes to the theatre,
and not a man who drinks, smokes,
swears or gambles; that a little
negro boy shocked the community
during the Christmas holidays by
using the word "dam," and he
was arrested and placed in a jail
that .had been tenantless for sev
eral months.
"There's not even a motion pic
ture show in the community,"
said the evangelist. "Somebody
tried to start one there, but it
failed because nobody would at
tend the performances."
If all this be true, then the peo
ple of Blue Mountain are loo good
for this world. They ought to all
sprout wings and lly away to join
the angels in Heaven without even
stopping at the gate to make for
mal application of St. 1'cter for
admission.
We accept the statement of the
evangelist as true, of course, and
if it be true, then Blue Mountain
must be about the most monoton
ous spot in all this universe.
