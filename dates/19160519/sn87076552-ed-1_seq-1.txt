The order of Knights of Pythias
was founded in Washington D. C.
February 19th, 1864, by Justus
Henry Rathbone and four associates
all or whom were government clerks.
The purpose was. to institute a fra
ternal .organization! unlike any ex
isting order, for the purpose of dis
seminating the principles of friend
ship, charity . and benevolence. The
whole fabric of the fraternity organ
ized by Mr. Rathbone and his
assoribtei rests upon the tory af
"Damon and Pythias" which teaches
the principles of "Friendship Unto
Death," and the three cardinal tenets
of the teachings of the order are.
'toleration in religion, obedience to

law and loyalty to government. The
organization always intensely patriotic
grew rapidly, from a membership of
t2 in lat4 the order has grown to
a membership of nearly a million who
are in good and regular standing In
the United States and Canada.
On January 1st, 1915 there wore in
the Domain of Ohio 635 lodges with
a total membershp of 86,864. These
lodges during the year 1914 expended
$192,570.82 for relief and funeral ex
penses The Grand Lodge of Ohio
during that year, expended $42,478.92
for the educaton of orphans and
maintained a widow's and orphans
fund of $571,497.97.
In nearly every town and village
in these United States there will
be found men who are leaders of
the thoughL end in the business of
their community; men who reprep
sent the better interests of. fellow
ship and the highest standard of
manhood; they are Knights of Py
thias who are true and loyal to the
teachings of their order. It is
i mall wonder that this organization
is growing by leaps and bounds for
the reason that thoughtful men re
alize the certain benefits of affili
ating with an organizaton whose pre
dominating virtues comprise the best
elements of friendship and whose
high aim is to raise the standard of
character in the citizenship of the

THE EMPIRE FULLS
Last of A Series of Articles on
ihe Career of Napoleon Written
Especially for The Tribune by
Earl M. Wocd.
The Czdr Alexander of Russia did
not pause in his pursuit of Napoleon
who was on the retreat from Moscow,
but galloped into Germany to deal the
French Emperor another blow. The
people of Germany hailed Alexander's
coming as the arrival of the libera
tor of the people from the yoke of
Napoleon, and although the Emperor
appealed to the German princes to
crush these sentiments, they could
not stem the tide of popular feeling.
Half a dozen of the Princes and Grand
Dukes deserted the Confederation of
the Rhine and declared themselves
allies of the Czar, and they were im
mediately followed by Prussia,"" the
first big state to throw off the yoke
of France. Napoleon had raised a
new army from the megar male pop
ulation of his countries, and appeal
ed to his father-in-law, the Emperor
r rancis. of Austria to come to Jus
aid against the Prussians and the
Russians. But Austria very wisely
proclaimed her neutrality which
should Napoleon that family ties
are nothing when affairs of state are
at stake.
The French met the Russians and
the Prussians at several point in Ger
many and sent them reeling back to
ward Austria. But the Czar's de
feat was fortunate for the Allies is
it drove them into the arms of Aus
tria who forsook her neutrality and
joned the coalition against Napoleon.
Every day, new German states were
forsakng France and going over to
the cause of the Allies, Prince Sch
warzenburg with a .mighty Austrian
army joined the Allies in Germany,
whle other Austrian armies set about
to d.ive the French put of Italy.
At Leipsic, the battle of the na
tions was fought, and the Russians,
Prussians and Austrians drove Na
poleon across the Rhine in defeat.
In desperation the Emperors called
for recruits to save Paris, but there
were no more to come. He sought
to divert the course of the avenging
Allies by leading them away, but
the ruse failed, and Paris with the
Empress Marie Louise and her son,
the King of Rome fell into the hands
of the Allied monarchs.
Napoleon gave hmself up and sign
ed his abdication to the throne of
France. He was to be made Emper
or of Elba, a small island near Italy,
but he was to be separated from his
wife and son. Marie Louise was to
become Duchess of Parma, and the
King of Rome was to enter the Aus
trian army under the name of the
Duke of Reichstadt. The Bourbons
