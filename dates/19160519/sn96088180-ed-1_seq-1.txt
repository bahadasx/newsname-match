to Bedierect Ecrcpe, Also Talcg Rap at tie Make
Believe Policy cf Wcciow Wilson Adddstratica
Detroit, May 1. Colonel Roose
velt carried a message of warning to
Henry Ford'a talllwlck today. He
denounced Ford's pacificism, raked
the Wilson administration for "make-
believe preparedness," and announced
that only a policy of staunch readi
ness would keep the United 8tate In
the forefront of the world' affair.
Roosevelt accused influential Ger
mans who reflect the views of the
German government of approving the
plana of German-American paflcista
In the United States with the Idea of
keeping the United State unprepared
while maintaining tiermany'a readi
ness. The colonel said that for Ford per
sonally he ha "not merely friendli
ness, tmt In many respects genuine
admiration," but he went on to
classify the automobile with the
torles of the war of the American re
volution and the copperheads of the
sixties. . ' -"
Ford supporters In the primaries,
he said ,'semlngly come from three
classes worktngmen, who believe
that he represents a desire to do
justice to them; pacificists, who think
thst a policy of helplessness in the
face of other nations will Inspire
our national safety; and German
Americans, some of them In an hon
est and sincere mood of protest and
others under the Influence of that
portion of the professional German
Americans who have permitted their
devotion to the mother country final
ly to make them antagonistic to the
welfare of the United States.' '
"The ultra-paclflrlsts hsve made
their great showing," continued
Roosevelt, "principally because there
has been no real opposition to -them.
The administration has done nothing
efficient to sustain our national
rights, It has stood for applied paci
ficism so far as our needs are con
cerned. Although our governmental
representatives have been 98 per cent
feeble, the ultra-pacificists have de
mandded a clear 100 per cent of
futility and feebleness.
"In any, serious crisis there are al
ways men who try to carry water on
both shoulders. It I true, that In
ordinary political matters com
promise la essential. But there
come great crises when compromise
Is Impossible or fatal. This is one
of these crises.
"There Is no use saying that we
will fit ourselves to defend ourselves
a little but not much. . Such a posi
tion Is equivalent - to announcing
that, it necessary, we shall hit but
shall only hit softly. The only right
principle Is to avoid hitting, It it is
possible to do so, but never, under
any circumstances, to hit softly.
"There are two great issues be
fore us which are Inseparably tound
together. These are the Issues of
Americanism and preparedness. - As
a people we have to decide whether
we are to be, In good faith, a people
able and ready to toko rare of our
selves; or whether wo doubt our na
tional unity and tear to prepare, and,
Instead, to trust partly to a merciful
Providence and partly to elocutionary
ability In high places. Those In
power In Washington have taken the
latter position."
Roosevelt outlined his views . on
preparedness and' the administra
tion course In the German-American
submarine controversy and urged the
necessity for "competent men at the
head of the navy, a regular army of
SRO.000 men, with universal military
training, Industrial preparedness and
the abolition of th hyphen." He de
plored the establishment of a govern
ment armor plate plant a a "thor
oughly mlschevlou step of endea
voring to cripple a great industry.''
He advocated the strictest regula
tion Inatead.
Roosevelt also severely criticised
the president for appointing, he said,
the bead of the war, state and navy
department "for political reasons. "
"We, through our representatives
at Washington," declared the colonel,
"have J absolutely refused In the
smallest degree to prepare daring
these twenty-two months of world
cataclysm. We have refused to learn
the smallest part of the lesson being
written In Europe. 1 We have endea
vored to deceive ourselves . by an
nouncing that In this policy of supine
inaction and of failure to perform
duty we are actuated by the loftiest
motive. :. I doubt whether we have
really deceived ourselves, and most
certainly we have not deceived oth
ergi We must make this nation as
strong aa are It conviction In refer
ence to right and wrong. It little
matters what onr ideal may be and
what achievements we may hope tor.
If these Ideals and achievements can
not be reduced to action."
. Roosevelt declared that the "ex
treme naval party In Germany re
cently advocated war with tire United
States on the ground that, In the end,
aa a result of such a war, we would
have to pay all the war expenses of
the Germanic powess - and their
allies." '
"These enormous sums would be
raised by taxation on all our citizens.
ThoBe of German descent would pay
aa heavily as those of any other de
scent, and all would ehare equally
the shame and dishonor. A foreign
foe Is the foe of all of us alike. If
(n this land the citizens of one na
tional origin successfully set the
fashion of Influencing this nation to
its own detriment tn the Interest of
the country from which they original
ly came, sooner or later It Is Certain
that the citizens of some other na
tional origin will repeat the experi
ment, and this country will be left
degraded and helpless among the na
tions. It such an event befall ns, the
bitter bread of humiliation will be
eaten by all those. who dwell In this
land, no matter what their creed, no
matter what their national origin.
It will be eaten by your children and
grandchildren and great grand
children Just a It Is by mlna."
I With regard to International af
fairs, Roosevelt said:
"There ia not a nation in the world
which believes that our course of con
duct has been dictated by anything
save timidity, unworthy shrinking
from effort and responsibility, and
cold and ' selfish love . of money
making and soft ease."
- Roosevelt's visit to Ford's auto
mobile plant was officially announced
today ..but Ford is meeting Roosevelt
at a hotel this afternoon. Roosevelt
explained that he had not asked tor
a meeting with Ford. The latter ask
ed htm to a conference to discuss pre
paredness. ,
; While the colonel was speaking to
day the ' Anti-Preparedness league
sent a placarded wagon through tho
down town streets presenting pleas
for peace. . . , ;

The section which was killed pro
vides that the shipping board shall

a soon as the belligerents feel there
is the slightest chance of starting an
exchange of peace Ideas. His offer is"
expected to come at a speech to be
delivered at a meeting of the League
to Enforce Peace. , ' '
The president will not offer 1 to
mediate, neither will he make any
attempt to force a negotiation which
might be. considered Inopportune to
either group of belligerents. Tha
feeling in official and dtplomatlo cir
cles la thst peace Is further away to

A reeling has spread through; the
world's capltaU that Germany la
most anxious for peace. The allieef
countries regard this anxiety as base
on necessity.
This Is likely to make the allies go
to the limit In the hope of crush
ing Germany, making their forms so
harsh that they cannot be accepted,

there Is no hope for peace until aftef
the allies launch their expected major
offensive.1 '.
