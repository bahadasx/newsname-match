j The movement by the Greenwood

delegations decided to let the issue
die.
The resolution follows:
"Resolved by the Democracy of
South Carolina in convention assembled,
That section 2S of the rules of
the Democratic party of South Carolina
adopted by the State convention
held May 20-21, 1914, and providing
for county-to-county campaign meetings,
be and hereby is repealed/'
