TWO OPINIONS.
Mr. Editor:?I've just heard a man
who has been voting me Democratic
ticket for twenty live years, (regard?
less of the meriis of the candidates),
say that he would vote for any can?
didate against Wilson, except Boose
volt, and as between him and WiiSon
hu would not vote at all.
His quarrel with Wnson is that he
is too belligerent and instead of warn?
ing Americans to stay at home, pre?
ferred to warn Germany not to mur?
der them at sea.
I have heard a man within a week
who has consistently voted the Re
publicnn ticket, (regardless of the
merit of the candidates), say that he
will vote for Wilson against any man,
because he (Wilson) is the only man
in the United Suites who had the
will (and ability) to keep this country
out of the European war, and tin;
firmness to avoid a war with Mexico.
Now, the reason 1 cite these two
opinions is to propound an interrog?
atory which here follows:
From the standpoint of patriotism
and good citizenship, which of these
two peace-loving party renegades is
in the right, the Democrat who blames
Wilson for "protesting" against the
murder on the high seas of American
citizens or the Republican who ac?
knowledges that he is the only man
in the United States who co'uid (or
would) have kept our country at
peace? INQUIRER.
NOTES OF NORTH TAZEWELL.
In the determination of the corp
rate limits of this town it appears
that certain properties in a section of
the burg were not included, and while
enjoying all its benefits?streets,
side walks, water supply, and police
protection, have heretofore paid no
corporation taxes. I hear this pe?
culiar situation is to bo ameliorated
with the full consent of the owners of
the properties, and hereafter will con?
tribute greater to the town's income.
Rev. James R. Brown, a former
Tazewell boy, preached the Memo?
rial sermon for the Knights of Pyth?
ins last Sunday. His subject was
"Greater Love," etc., and the sermon
was well received. The order marched
from the hall to scats reserved for
the members and made a fine appear?
ance. Mr. Brown is now pastor of the
M. E. church at Bramwell.
There is perhaps no town in tho
State where more attention is paid
to gardening than this, and hence
the dry weather and prevailing wind?
storms nre creating more or less dis?
quietude and about the only satisfac?
tion the horticulturists get out of the
situation is that the weather that de?
lays the growth of vegetation is mak?
ing it destructively uucom fori able foi
tho predatory cut worm.
Wo hear that Miss Bessie Peery
now under treatment in Maryland
hag been taking some outdoor oxor
Clin
eise, and ?will possibly be homo In
June.
The condition of Mr. Jas. S. Whit
ley is not materially changed, certain?
ly" not for the worse.
Mr. W. L. Baker has done much re
I contly to improve his house and the
I grounds in the Bend, setting an ex?
ample that it is hoped many of his
I neighbors will emulate.

DEBT-PAYING RELIGION.
"We have been enjoying fine; re?
vivals down our way for sometime
I suppose your subscribers are all
paying up now promptly." This is
what a gentleman said the other
day to the editor of this paper. It
would be a pleasure to answer "Yes,"
BUT
The newspaper account is the very
last some folks think of paying, and
some pay not at all, and from com?
munities, too, where the loudest shout?
ing is heard, and the greatest revivals
prevail. A man who doesn't pay his
debts or make satisfactory arrange?
ments for their settlement, gives pret?
ty clear proof that his religion, if
he has any at all, gives him little
worry. It is doubtful, whether or
not such an individual is downright
and clear cut honest to the heart. We
mean the man who can but wont.

motives which have guided his hand
ling of the European situation.
America, the president said, is foi
peace because she loves peace it ltd
ielicVC8 the present war has carried,
the nations engaged so far tlltll they
I'lllltlOt he held to ordinal v standard. 1
if responsibility. Itm, he added, the
United States has grown lo he one of
he erratest nations of the world and
therefore must act more or less
from the point of the view of the rest
of the world.
'.If 1 cannot train my moral in?
fluence over n man except by occas?
ionally knocking him down." he said,
"if that is the only hasis on which
he will respect me, then for the sake
of his soul I have got to occasionally
knock him down."
The president, declared he had been
kept nwnke nights considering the
European situntion, liecau.se there
alight come II lime when the United
States would have to do what it del
not desire to do, and "the great bur?
den on my spirits has been that it
has been up lo nie to choose when
that time comes." He added thai he
ilid not conceive that, he had been
elected president, to do as he pleased.
"If I were if would have been much
more interesting," he said.
Impressions of public men as a
class were given frankly by tin'
president. with the comment thai
some grew nnd some swelled, lie al?
so discussed the relations of the
newspapers lo the nlfnirs of the na?
tion and sounded a warning that false
infoi mat ion about, forign n(Tail's was
more than likely to lead lo trouble.
"I was thinking as I was looking
forward to coming here this evening
if that other occasion, when I stood
very nearly at the throshhold of the
duties that 1 have since been called
upon to perform, and I was going ov?
er in my mind the impressions I
then had by way of forecast, of the
duties of President and countering
them with the experiences that, have
followed. I milSt say that the fore?
cast has been Very largely verified
Hid the impressions 1 had then have
been deepened rather than weaken?
ed."
