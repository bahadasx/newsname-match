Detroit. Mey 19. Hundreds of
school children waving American
flags were among the throng which
greeted Theodore Roosevelt when he
arrived here today to be the guest of
honor at the American Day celebra
tion. Before Colonel Roosevelt was
driven to the Detroit Athletic club, at
the head of an automobile parade, he
made a short address to the Boy
Scouts who' were lined up in front of
the Htation. He told them he believed
in their organization because i: taught
them to tight, fo.r the truth and "not
to be mollycoddles." . After luncheon
at the Detroit. Athletic, club, Colonel
Roosevelt went to a local theater to
deliver an address on "Americanism
and l'reparedness for Peace."
This afternoon Colonel Roosevelt
was to make a short address to a mass
meeting in Grand Circus pari- in the
heart of the business district. It was
announced that he expected to spend
a few moments visiting Henry Ford
at the latter's automobile factory.
"Hi, Teddy," Said One.
The Roosevelt party arrived on
scheduled time at 8:10 and found a
couple of thousand Detroitans on hand
to greet the colonel. A citizen's com
mittee of 50 headed by Henry B. Jay
extended an official welcome.
A crowd of several hundred young
sters, including several troops of Boy
Scouts, blocked the party's progress
to the station exit.
"Hi, Teddy," shrilled one and the
colonel insisted upon making a
speech.
"Boys," he said, "don't be molly
coddles. Be above anything unmanly
or unclean."
Then the party proceeded to waiting
automobiles and the colonel was es
corted through lines of mounted po
lice and troops of Boy Scouts to the
Detroit Athletic club, where he break
fasted with half a hundred citizens
who signed the invitation for him to
visit Detroit.
Mothers Offer Sons.
Kxcept for -the block of seats re
served for 500 Detroit mothers who
are willing to offer their sons "for the
defense of the country," the seats in
the opera house were open to the
public.
50,000 IJned Streets. j
At least 50,000 persons lined the I
streets between the Detroit Athletic '-.
club and the Detroit opera house as
the colonel passed. The Campus Mar
tius, the great open square in the heart
of the city, directly in front of the
opera house, held' a great mass of
people, who cheered wildly as the col
onel came into view from Woodward
avenue. Many were women.
The police were forced to struggle
desperately to keep back the thou
sands who fought to gain entrance.
The enthusiasm of the noonday crowd
was in marked contrast to the early
morning throng that witnessed the ex
president's arrival.
Inside the building, every seat was
occupied almost an hour before the
colonel began his address. Approxi
mately two-thirds of the audience
were women.
Roosevelt's proposed visit to Ford
ROOSEVELTISMS FOR AMERICANS.
"We have refused to learn the smallest part of the lesson
being written on the scroll of torment in Europe."
"I doubt whether we have really deceived ourselves and most
certainly we have not deceived others."
"There is not a nation in the world which believes our course
of conduct has been dictated by anything save timidity, un
worthy shrinking from effort and responsibility and cold and
selfish love of money making."
"The only right principle is to prepare thoroughly or not
at all."
"The Wilson administration has taken no step for prepared
ness and has done nothing efficient to sustain our national
rights."
"We must make this nation as strong as are its convictions
in reference to right and wrong."
"We must abolish pork-barrel methods in the army."
"Americanism is a matter of the spirit, not of birthplace or
descent."
"We all stand together for our common flag and our com
mon country."
"It is not possible permanently to possess a divided national
allegiance. If men are not whole hearted in their Americanism,
if they try to combine loyalty to this land with loyalty to some
other land, it is inevitable that to a greater or lesser degree
they make the loyalty to another land overshadow their loy
alty to this."
"I am exactly as much opposed to English-Americans as to
German-Americans."
"I oppose all kinds of hyphenated Americanism."
"We are all part of the same people."
"The essence of this policy of full preparedness, which re
member is not only military but at least as much industrial
and social, is that it is purely defensive, and is the best pos
sible assurance of peace."
"No nation will ever attack a unified and prepared America."

Dr. J. H. Rinehart Will Place
Resignation W ith Governor.
Says Mob Tal V as 3 oi
Cause Goes to Abilene.
Dr. J. H. Rinehart will place his
resignation as coroner cf Shawnee
county in the hands of Governor Cap
per tomorrow. He made a statement
to that effect today. He also stated
specifically that his resignation had
nothing whatever to do with the criti
cism growiug out of the Bissell mob;
that the move had been under consid
eration for three months.
Dr. Rinehart will leave Topeka and
locate at Abilene, where he will take
over the practice of another physi
cian. He will leave within the next
two or three weeks. "
"I am going to resign." said Dr.
Rinehart today, "but I am not resign
ing because of anything that grew out
of the mob. I have had the matter
under consideration for two or three
months. I want to thank the people
of Topeka and Shawnee county for
their kindnesses to me. I have tried
to conduct the office of coroner eco
nomically and conscientiously.
It will be up to Governor Capper to
make an appointment to fill the va
cancy created by Dr. Rinehart's resig
nation. The office of coroner is not
particularly lucrative and no flock of
candidates for the appointment is ex
pected. There has been more or less criticism
directed at Dr. Rinehart since the
night the mob went to Lawrence seek
ing Fred Bissell, murderer of Edna
Dinsmore. Sheriff Cummings of
Douglas county made statements to
Sheriff L. L. Kiene, quoting Dr. Rine
hart, which ruffled Kiene. He an
nounced upon his return to Topeka
from Lansing that he would ask for a
warrant for the arrest of Rinehart
charging him with being a ringleader
of the mob. So far as is known the
warrant has never been requested.
Friends of Dr. Rinehart say his at
titude towards Bissell and his con
nection with the mob were misrepre
sented. Call Off "ew Rates.

Ford Asked a Conference.
"Ford wrote several months ago
inviting me to come to Detroit and to
visit his automobile plant and discuss
the preparedness question with me,'
Roosevelt said. "It has been reported
erroneously that it was I who askei
to meet Ford. He wrote mo and lat

coming to Detroit and requested a con

replied I would meet him at the

LOOKING FOR 7000
Tremendous Crowd Will Open
Topeka Playgrounds June 19.
Then on July 4 Big City Track
Meet Will Be Held.
It Is expected that 7,000 children
will fill the nine Topeka public play
grounds June 19 for the official open
ing. Special exercises will be held
in Chesney and Ripley parks. In Rip
ley park the wading pool donated by
the Rotary club will be dedicated, and
the pool donated by Governor Capper,
in Chesney park, will be dedicated on
the same day.
"The Topeka children on the play
grounds will have one continual round
of high jinks all summer," W. P. Mac
Lean, playground director, said this
morning. "There will be track meets,
baseball games, croquet matches, ten
nis tournaments, horseshoe pitching
contests, vollev ball tournaments.
Every playground is to have at least
I wo tennis courts. " j "
there will be four.
"The first big event of the season
will be the city track meet July 4.
This will be held at Ripley park on
account of the new running track
made there. The track is a half mile
long, thirty feet wide and has a 220
yard straightaway. Last year there
were more than three hundred entries
in every sort of event and the children
showed some rare class for grade
school pupils. We expect double the
entries this year- There will be four
classes of entries in the meet: children
under 85 pounds; children under 100
pounds; children under 120 pounds
and the unnmitea ciass.
"Besides the track meet there are to
be many other special occasions which
we have not definitely decided upon
yet. But, as was the case last sum
mer, we will have a Doll Baby parade
day and a Fancy Lantern day with
i prizes otrered ror tne Desi aesigns.
The season will close witn a monster
Playground Pageant. And there will
be many hikes and industrial tours.
"The Darks and playgrounds are not
directed especially for the recreation
of the children. We want everyDooy.
Last year hundreds of people used the
croauet grounds and tennis courts, and
we want them to do the same this year.
Last year there were 5,000 children
registered as using the playgrounds.
This year we expect the registration to
reach 7,000. By last summer's figures
Chesney park was the most popular
ground as there were over 1,259 chil
dren who played there."
TWO GALLONS ALCOHOL
Clyde Walton Convicted for Making
Fake Liquor Deliveries.
Clyde E. Walton was convicted in
the court of Topeka today of making
fake deliveries of liquor while acting
as deliveryman for the American Ex
press company and with failing to se
cure the signatures of persons to
whom the liquor was consigned. He
was- fined and sentenced in two cases
a total of $400 and 120 days in jail.
Walton immediately appealed his
case to the district court and was re
leased on a bond of $500. He was not
a regular driver for the express com
pany but handled extra deliveries and
it was shown that he requested that
all liquor consigned to "J. F. Ford
and "Tom Joe" be placed on his de
livery sheet. The name Tom Joe"
aroused suspicion and investigation
was made. Two barrels of beer turned
over to Walton to deliver, were found
in his father's barn. He was also con
victed of delivering; two gallons of
alcohol.
HIS ONLY HOPE
Pardon or Parole Alone Can
Save George Badders.
Mandate of the Supreme Court
Arrives in Topeka.
IT ORDERS HIM TO PRISON
Not Even the Customary 30
. Days of Grace.
He Must Serve Five Years and
Pay $7,000.
Unless subsequent arrangements are
made with Fred Robertson, United
States district attorney, George S.
Badders must present himself at once
to the United States marshal to be
transported to the federal peniten
tiary, there to serve a term of five
years on the charge of "using the
mails in the furtherance of a scheme
to defraud."
The mandate of the supreme court
of the United States, ordering Badders
to the penitentiary at Leavenworth,
was received by Morton Albaugh,
clerk of the federal district court,
and placed on record this morning. :
Ordinarily a person convicted of a
federal offense has thirty days after
tne mandate is spread on record to
begin serving his sentence. But in
the Badders case the mandate says
nothing about a thirtv-day extension
of liberty. The bond of $ 10.000 Bad
ders has on file with the clerk of the
court, says nothing about the thirty
days. According to local officials of
the federal court Badders must be
gin serving his sentence at once.
The mandate fixes Badders' punish
ment at five years in the penitentiary
and the payment of a fine of $7,000.
Badders was convicted on seven dif
ferent counts and was sentenced to
five years penal servitude on each
count and the payment of a.fine.f
$1,000 on each count. The peniten-1
tiary sentences will run concurrently,,
so he will have only five years to
serve.
His Only Hope.
The only hope Badders now has is
a pardon or parole from President
Wilson. He has exhausted every other
means of keeping out of the peniten
tiary. His case was in the supreme
court of the United States, appealed
on a writ of error from the federal
district court and when, February 2,
the former, court upheld the decision
of the lower court, Badders' fate was
sealed.
That portion of the mandate which
covers Badders' sentence reads as fol
lows: "The court orders- and adjudges that
the defendant, George S. Badders, be
imprisoned in the United States peni
tentiary at Leavenworth for a perid of
five years on each of the second, third.
fourth, fifth, sixth, ninth and eleventh
counts of the indictment herein, and
that he make his fine unto the United
States of America in the sum of $1,000
on each of the second, third, fourth.
fifth, sixth, ninth and eleventh counts
of the indictment herein, and that said
period of five years as to each of the
said counts shall run concurrently and
not cumulatively, so that the imprison
ment of George S. Badders in the fed
eral penitentiary shall be for a period
of five years and no more, and the
total amount on account of said fines
$7,000."
Living in Wichita.
Badders is now living in Wichita,
where he is the local agent for an
automobile factory. He is said to
have won the confidence and respect
of his employers and that they will
use their influence in his behalf.
Within the last two- months Badders
has sent numerous letters to former
friends in Topeka asking them to
write to President Wilson urging
clemency in his case. Badders thinks,
he says, he has been sufficiently pun
ished. The Badders case created a sensa
tion in Topeka when the indictment
was returned April 22, 1914. He had
been reared in Topeka and had held
responsible positions. When little more
than a boy he held a position in the
office of the United States district at
torney in Topeka. Then he went to
Colorado for several years and when
he returned he was made secretary of
the Topeka Commercial club. He was
active in civic affairs while he held
this position and became sufficiently
well acquainted with men who were
financially responsible, to open up the
Badders Clothing company, located at
the corner of Seventh and Kansas
avenues.
His store first attracted attention
when he put on a sale at which cloth
ing was sold for less than the ordinary
layman believed it could be bought
for at wholesale. Later it developed
he was doing that very thing. It was
brought out in this case that he pur-

M. Twenty-five Mexican cowboys
from the Hearst ranch at Babaricora
broke and scattered a newly formed
gang of bandits near Madera about a
week ago, killing 1 5, wounding one
and capturing six, according to news
reaching here today.
The band has been organized by
Atesutre Dotninguez and Pedro Cas

Americans and adherents of Carranza.
Following the theft of a number of
horses from the Hearst ranch they be

Viejo. The six taken prisoner were

was sent across the border about nine
weeks ago up to nearly 250.
The cowboys captured 30 horses, a

Columbus, X. M., May 19. Ninety
Villista prisoners captured by Ameri

Ojo Azules, Chihuahua, late in April,
have been released, according to
civilians returning to the border today.
The prisoners were held some days
and questioned in an attempt to ob- i
tain information concerning the move-
j ments of the various scattered bands
! and then released. At military head
j quarters here the reports concerning
j the release were received with little
! surprise, although a number of prison
j era have been captured during the
; campaign but six of them have been
i imprisoned in the stockade built here.
A number of American soldiers en
i camped between Colonia Dublan and
Namiquipa recently became, ill after
eating food purchased from Mexicans
j and as a result several of the natives
i were taken into custody, the arrivals
said. Military authorities have taken
steps to prevent a repetition of the
danger.
Heavy traffic over the motor truck
trail from Columbus to Namiquipa has
made it almost impassable, truckmen
say. In some places the road, despite
effort of the engineering corps, has be
