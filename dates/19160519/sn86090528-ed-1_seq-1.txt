ROOSEVELT
ON ANOTHER
RAMPAGE
By Cnlted Press.
Detroit, Mich., May 19. In a speech
delivered here today,- Theodore
itoosevelt lambasted pacificism and
scored the administration for what he
called "make-believe" preparedness.
itoosevelt. declared that only
staunch readiness and the nolle of
democratizing through nationalizing
could keep America in the forefront
among the nations of the world.
in uie coursn of his speech, the
f ieaker called the governmental rep
resentatives at Washington "ninety
six per cent feeble-minded." He de
manded a competent head for the na
vy, an army of a quarter of a million
of men and universal military service.
In one part of bis address Mr.
Roosevelt said:
- "Let my pacificist friends under
stand that I am advocating prepared
ness m as to avoid war, and I am ad
vocating preparedness in the work of
peace as In military matters. I be
lieve In a thoroughly efficient navy,
the second in size in the world. I be
lieve in a small but thoroughly effi
cient regular army, an arm of 2.10,
0io men, with a proper reserve. This
would give us a mobile army of 123,
(mh) men. But back of the regular
army and navy must stand the
strength of the people themselves.
and this strength must be Drenarert
in advance or it wit be utterly use
less In time of trial.
"I believe in universal service based
on universal training, r believe in
this berause I think it would be not
ojily of incalculable benefit to the na
tion in the event of war, but of incal.
ctilablo benefit to the individuals un
dergoing It, and therefore to the na
tion, as regards the work of peace. I
believe that the dog-tent would prove
a most effective agent for democratiz
ing and nationalizing our life; quite
as much so an the public school, and
far more so than the American facto
ry and the American city as thev are
j today. Prepareduess through univer
sal service would turn out to be the
I best possible school of practical clv
Mcs. In such a school all men who
8 re Americans in spirit would get to-
gether and learn to work together, so
as to insure co-operation among our
people In social and Industrial life.
Such co-operation will secure not
merely liberty and opportunity, but
also the sense of obligation which is
Just as important as the other two."

Miss Cochran Gives Salutatory; Wallace
Thompson, Historian; Norman Duncan,
Poet; Valedictory Address is
by Miss Coryell
Again, last night, was the audito
rium of the Chickasha high school
filled to its utmost capacity, this time
with relatives, friends and admirers
of the seniors of 19 1C, who held their
class exercises. Baskets of flowers
decorated the rostrum, whereon the
seniors, in caps and gowns, sat ".. ith
Superintendent Ramey. Miss Marjo-
rie Dwyer, the class president, presid
ed, announcing the numbers on the
program. Miss Marjory Cochran, the
salutatorinn, delivered a pretty and
appropriate welcome to the audience,
her address being followed by a well
rendered number by a quartette, "Do
Not Mind Your Sorrows." Compos
ing the quartette were Miss Zella
Stoddard, Miss Lucile Westfall, 'Ar
thur Griffith and Louie Gardner.
The class history was next given by
Wallace Thompson. The speaker had
taken considerable trouble to prepare
an authentic account of the salient
facts in tlie lives of the forty-one
members of tho class and in his inter
esting summary brought out especial
ly their educational history. He stat
ed that twenty of the class had start
ed to school in Chickasha. ten of
them starting with Miss Morey, now
Mrs. Edgar Cowan. Only three of the
seniors, AJlsseg iois Horn, Grace Hat-
sell and Ada Hudgins were born in
Chickasha, and only eight in Oklaho
ma. The largest number from any
one state was thirteen, and they were
from Texas. One member, Miss Mary
Eppier, came from Strassburg, Ger
many.
Tho class poem was delivered by
the author, Norman Duncan, and was
a creditable production, indeed. The
class will, phrased in legal terminol
ogy, was then xead from a roll of
parchment by Arthur Griffith.
The cremation services followed,
and the burning of text books in a
huge black urn was quite a spectac
ular scene. The students recited ap
propriate verses as they threw their
books Into the blaze. Miss Nellie
Wendt, the tlass prophet, then held
a book of blank pages over the flames,
and read what the fairies of the fire
wrote thereon concerning the futures
of her class mates.
The valedictory was delivered by
Miss Martha Grace Coryell, the young
est member of the class, in an earnest
and sincere manner. In closing she
plucked the petals from a cluster of
pansies which she held as she said
farewell to the underclassmen, the
faculty, the school board, Mr. Ramey
and her senior classmates.
Tho class song, composed by Misses
Alberta Smith and Claire Woodson,
and sung by the senior body, was the
final number on the evening's Dro-
gram.

gressman Scott Ferris to the Express,

LOSES BUT
FARES FINE
El Reno Golf Players Trim Chickasha
Contingent but Bind Up Wounds of
Yanguished with Oil of Gen
erous Hospitality
As an incidental feature of the oc
casion, thbre was a golf tournament
in which Chickasha was trimmed but
the "big show" at El Rpi;o yesterday
was the entertainment which the El
Reno folks gave their guests. At
leust that is tho way the members of
the Chickasha conting.Mit were tell
ing it and talking about it today and
they couldn't find superlatives strong
enough to express their approval of
the hospitality that was accorded
them at the Canadian county capital.
Judging from reports, the El Reno
Country club fellows simply threw
the throttle wide open and "busted"
the speed limit into smithereens in
their efforts to show their Chickasha
visitors a good lime. If there could
have been any bitterness in defeat at
the hands of so generous a foe, the
cordial treatment that was meted out
to the vanquished removed the last
vostige of it, leaving nothing but un
mitigated sweetness.
The Chickasha people were met at
the train by a committee and were
escorted to the Southern hotel where
a fine dinner was served to them.
Cars then conveyed them to the Conn
try club and while the men fought
merrily back and forth over the links
the ladies were entertained at an auc
tion bridge party. After the match
an elaborate picnic luncheon was
served on the lawn of the club house
and when the party returned to town
for the evening, they were taken to i
the Elks club to enjoy a delightful
dance till train time.
The final score in the match stood
32 to 25 in favor of El Reno. A re
turn match will be played here on
Wednesday, June 14, and it is hinted
that the Chickasha crowd will make
some strenuous efforts to duplicate
tho hospitable conduct of El Reno.
The Chickasha players who won their
matches; were tho following:
D. M. Cavaness, 3; IS. A. Ludlow, 3;
Jno. Gribi, 3; W. T. Phillips, 3; J. W.
Richhurg, 3; L. C. Hutson, 3; R. B.

If you are engaged in any business
for which a city license is required,
you'd better call on City Clerk Rey

want to get into trouble.
So decrees Mayor Coffman, who to
day announced that all licenses must
be paid on or before June 1, as re
quired by law. Pool halls, dray wa

By I'Dited Press.
Portland, Ore., May 19. A three
cornered race between Senator Cum
mins, Theodore E. Burton and Jus
tice Hughes for the Republican nom
ination for president featured Ore
gon s presidential pretereiice prima
ry today. Early reports indicated a
large vote.
Most of the candidates for dele
gates to the Republican and Demo
cratic national conventions have
agreed to abide by today's preferen
tial vote. Ten delegates to each con
vention will go from Oregon.
Woodrow Wilson is the only Dem
ocratic candidate for president. Vice
President Marshall and Governor Ma
jors of Missouri oppose each other
for the Democratic vice presidential
nomination.
Cummins and Burton have been ac
tive candidates.
Charles E. Hughes is a candidate
against his own wishes. He wrote to
Secretary of State Olcott asking that
his name be left off the ballot. De
spite his request, Hughes' supporters
filed a petition signed by 1300 voters
demanding that his name be put on
the ballot. Olcott declined to remove
his name. Hughes telegraphed again
that he did not want his name on the
ballot. But there it is.
The Oregon supreme court dech'.ad
that Hughes has nothing to say about
it. If .enough people w ant him In the
White House, he must run. A writ of
mandamus was issued commanding
Olcott to print Hughes' name. A
strong element among Oregon Repub
licans favors Hughes.
Yes, there was a fourth Republican .
presidential candidate. His name is
Charles E. Lockwood and he styled j
himself, on the ballot, "Oregon's fa- j
vorito son." He lives in Portland, j
He withdrew in favor of Hughes.
James Innian of Looking Glass, '
Ore,, abandoned his usual custom of I
filing for the Republican presidential j
nomination. . j
C.'N. McArthur (incumbent), E. V. j
Littlefield, and A. W. Lafferty (ex- j
representative) are opponents for the j
Republican nomination for represen
tative in congress from the Third dis
trict. Representative W. C. Hawley

Second districts have no opponents.

he stepped to the corn patch about
100 yards west of the house, where he
found her dead. He said he had seen
her working there about 4 . p. m. the

neighbor there, and they called the
officers.
Klager's testimony was essentially
the same. Both men agreed that all
Indications showed that Mrs. Skaggs
had lain there all night. There were
no tracks near the body, which was
lying partly on top of the hoe. An in
teresting bit of testimony offered was
that Mrs. Skaggs' collie was found
lying near his mistress, protecting her
to Jhe last.
Dr. White, acting county health of
ficer, the only other witness called,
stated that he had examined the
body, that there were dark spots

Inquiry Continues. 'I t
By United Press.
London, May. 19 Augustine Bir
rell, former chief secretary for Ire
land, testified today before the royal
commission inquiring into the Irish
rebellion that he asked Kitchener to
send troops to Ireland before the out-
break but Kitchener refused because
no troops were available.
The Italians in southern Tyrol now
are tenaciously holding back the Aus
trians from further inroads into their
positions. In the Ledro valley, south
west of Trent, and in Lagarina val
ley, south of the city, the Austrians,
after heavy artillery preparation,
threw vicious attacks against the Ital
ian lines, but all were repulsed with
heavy casualties, according to Rome.
Five attacks were made on Zeg
natorta, the same number as were
made Wednesday, and again all of
them were stopped with sanguinary
losses.
In the Adamello zone, west of Trent,
where previous gains have been made
by the Italians, King Victor Emman
uel's men have occupied additional
territory in the Sarca river region and
in the Monfalcome region near the
head of the Gulf of Triest hare recap
tured trenches taken from them bj;
the Austrians last Monday.
Another ineffectual attempt has
been made by the Germans against
the French positions in the Avocourt
wood and on hill 304, northwest of
Verdun. Paris reports that a strong
attack here was put down by the
French guns and that the Germans
appear to have suffered severe losses.
On the remainder of the front in
France and Belgium, aside from aa
unsuccessful Cerraau infantrv attack
against the Belgians north of Steen
rtraete, thoro have been only bombardments.
