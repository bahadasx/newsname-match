Í consisting of Ave young ladies dressed
in beautiful graduating gowns, and
three young men attired in plain ev
ening dress, marched upon the ros-
aS tram from the office In the High
school and were seated before a large
audience which had gathered for the
occasion.
The Rev. H. W. Lowry gave the In
vocation immediately after the or
chestra had finished its selection, and
this was followed by a duet, "Rock of
Ages" which was well rendered by
Mrs. Joseph Bunch and Mrs. Dudley
Smith. Mrs. Walter Ralph was to
Appear for two numbers on the pro
gram but because of the accident to
her boy by an explosion of gunpowder,
she was unable to appear and Mrs.
Dudley Smith consented to appear in
jjjr her stead.
After the duet, Supt. Brinton stat
ed that the custom for graduating ex
ercises was changing soma every year
and that he had endeavored to keep
paca with these changes and had se
cured a speaker for the evening who
would give the graduating class some
thoughts upon the eve of their com
mencement that they might well pon
der over In entering upon a career
out into the world's activities. He
then introduced Dr. David R. Boyd,
of the State University who delivered
a splendid address, discussing the pos
sibilities of the educated young man
or young woman In the world.
He emphasised the fact that the
world today demanded educated men
and women in almost every activity.
This applied to all classes of labor
well as to the professions. For a
man or woman of the future to be un
educated was to Invite- a condition
bordering on slavery in a chosen pro
fession. He pointed out that the great
progress in science, invention, manu
facturing, and in all lines of life's
activities demanded the educated
young man or young woman.
He stated that the Treat banking
business houses of the United States
in looking for men to take charge of
their Interests in foreign states ad
vertised for college graduates whom
they were to train for their work.
Dr. Boyd dwelt largely upon the
training for citizenship. This to be
done in the public and high schools.
He stated that the more experience he
had in the world, the more convinced
he was that what the world needed
more than anvthlnir else was an edu-
'cated and higher standard of citizen
ship. This is particularly true in the
United States where its population is
made up of so many nationalities and
where the hyphenated individual in
these times of the world's crisis may
I be found almost upon every hand.
Dr. Boyd's address was a forceful
one and the advice he gave to the class
was such that if remembered will be
of much value In the beginning and
throughout a business career.
The orchestra then gave one of its
splendid selections and County Super
intendent W. A. Poore, as a member
of the Board of Education of thu
'ounty lliph School, presented the
diplomas.
j In his presentation speech Supt.
Poore outlined the progress of the
Carlsbad Hiirh School from the time
Smith. Their voices blended beauti
fully and made one foel the responsive
heart impulses that come from sweet
music.
Rev. II. W. 1-owry then pronounced
the benediction and the graduation
exercises of the class of l!lfl wre at
an end.
The events of the evening were most
pleasing and a large and appreciative
audience helped to make them so.
The Junior class had decorated the
rostrum in the pink and green of the
elass colors, and pennants were placed
about the class motto to bring out
more forcibly that statement: "If you
want anything, got after it". This
had been selected for tho class motto
and had been painted in the class
colors by .1. K. Linn and occupied a

Sir: You are hereby notified upon
behalf of the I 'ecos Water Users' as
sociation, a corponttion organixed un
der the laws of the Territory, (Now
State) of New Mexico, and each and
every shareholder thereunder that H
is our contention that all assess
ment of taxes for government, stat
and county purposes heretofore levied
and assessed have been illegally as
sessed, and that any further assess.
mens lor sucn purpoes will now b
made at your own risk.
in support or our contention wa cite
you to the following; decisions and au.
thorttics.
In connection with this Question I
think best to submit an opinion of
judtre win it. King, enter counsel vf
the United States Reclamation Ser
vice pertaining thereto and attach
ed which cites the same authorities
that 1 would have submitted to you.
I especially emphacise the decision
of the Supreme Court of th United
States In Stearns 25 Minnesota (17!
U. S., 22. 2r.l. which says "But it
has also been held that until tho ver
lust moment that liens or equitable
rights or the United States are ex
tinguished no matter how trivial or
small may be (he right or the lien
reserved, the land is not subject to
taxation.
If you can prove that the intern
ment does not retain a lien on ever
acre of bind in the Carlsbad project
then thin ruling of the Supreme Court
of the United States will not apply.

Mr. Samuel I.. Mctiee, HIM East Holt
Avenue, Tomona, nliforma.
Dear Sir: I have fully considered tho
iuestion as to the validity or the ta
assessed airainst the improvements on
your land by your state, and while
it in not nweHHHruy wiuiin me pur
view of the olllcial dutiee of counsel
for the reclamation service to look af
ter and advise upon legal matters of
this character, the question is of such,
importance to homesteaders upon rec
lamation projects that I deem it not
inappropriate to give my views on the
legul riuht of a slate to make and col
lect assessments on permanent im
provements upon land entered under
the homestead and reclamation lawsv
Our district counsel for your ter
ritory has heretofore been directed to
take step toward persuading the of
ficials of your county to cancel this
tax, and he has endeavored to do so,
hut without avail.
The statutes of your state make
provision for thil diss of anxora
inents, and the supreme court of Cali
fornia, also the supreme courts of
some other states, have hild tax as
assessments or this nature to be valid
ssessments or this n.itui j to be valid
and enforceable. Hut, after careful
Investigation, I am firmly of the op
inion that assessments of this char
acter are not enforceable and validly
can not be imposed upon permanent
improvements on lands held by a set
tler prior to date of linal proof, and.
ns to land on reclamation projects,
probably not until after issuance of
patent, and under the present law
possibly not until nil liens held on the
loud by the United Stoles are extin
guished Tuxution in such cabes is an at
tempt to do Indirectly what can not
be done directly anil clearly violates
both the letter and spirit of the con
stitution of the United States, which
gives to the ri nt rnl I'ovcrnment exdu
rive jill I-(In t Kin in Id,' illHpol or the
public illinium. To secure lille to
these lands improvement are requir
ed by act or roiiKresN.. If u state may,
miller pretense of tuxution, sell the
improvements on the hulilic domain
ix'cupied by n biinii (III,, settle under
the public land laws it cun thereby
prevent the ilixpoxul of the public dn
miiin in the manner provided by (he
luws of ronirress on the subject.
The supreme court of Idaho, in
Cheney v. Miniiluka county (144 Tac,
:i4:i). upheld an assessment made af
ter the date of final proof and before
the issuance of patent, where it seems
some acts remained to be performed
before the legnl title left the United
States, but this decision manifestly
overlooks the rase of United States v.
Rlcket (IHH U. K., 432 1 hereafter re.
ferred to, and also the holding of the
United States Supreme Court in
Northern I. Ry. Co. v. Traill county
(115 U. S.. m), in which latter rase
it is clearlv held that as to the lands
there considered, so lonir as anything
remains to be done in order to divest
the United States of the legal title,
they are not subject to taxation.
Permanent improvements are appur
tenant to. and accordingly a part of.
the land Itself, hence not taxable un
iese tho lands upon which located are
taxable. And on this subject the
United States Supreme Court, in
Stearna v. Minnesota (179 U. S., M3
