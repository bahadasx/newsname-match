Let's Observe
Fourth of
July
Now is the Time to Plan
for a Real, Old-Time
Celebration
Cut Bank should begin at
once to plan a celebration of the
Fourth of July. 11 i s three
years since Cut Bank celebrated
Independence Day. If we take
action early, it is quite probable
that other towns in this section
would be governed by this ac
tion, since Cut Bank has been
generous in times past in aiding
neighbor towns in promoting
successful celebrations.
This is the year to give vent
to our patriotic impulses. We
should turn our thoughts for at
least a day from the somewhat
sordid vocation of ringing the
cash register to a consideratioi
of our beloved America, stand
ing out, as the greatest and freest
nation of the world and alert to
defend its freedom and. honoi
at any cost.
So let's arrange for an explo
sion of ammunition at peep o'
day, t o release our pent-up
patriotism, for patriotic out
bursts of melody by the recent
ly the recently reorganized Cut
Bank band, a patriotic oration
and patriotic songs for a bi^
program of field and streei
sports, to satisfy all our desires
for a real "ye olden day" Fourth
of July celebration.
What do you think of the
idea, Neighbor? If you think
favorably, see your neighbors,
talk it over and then let us Efiief
and make definite arrangements.
A meeting of democratic
chieftains is being held at
Valier today. A number of the
faithful from here autoed over
to the irrigation town and will
sit in at the conclave.

Indiau Day was celebrated at the
Presbyterian church last Sunday
morning, with a splendid program
of music, recitations, talks and
essays. Miss Callison's essay on
the history of the American Indian
showed much thought in prepar
ation"
The peoii.'e are still bragging
about. Browning's ability to stage a
drama. Miss Martin's part, espe
cially, is calling for prolonged
praise.
As actors it would be hard to
equal Speck. Murphy and Monley,
to say uothing of the Misses Stew
art, Sherburne, (Jallison aud Martin.
Many think they gave the best
show that ever appeared in Brown
ing, aud that is saying a good deal.
The people are still singing t'.ie
»raises of Mrs, Thompson as con
ductor, and the members of the
•^horus in the recent Cantata, and
especially the sweet voice of Miss
Virginia Barnes.
The First National Bank of
Browning is a go. The prelimin
aries will soon be completed, a
building secured and the cashier at
tee window with a quill behind his
ear.
Say, what do you think of Brown
ing, anyway, with its bank and a
baseball team that can lick every
town around here? With a bank,

If you^re going to secure a towb
house for the winter in order to send
your children to a first class school,
secure the house in vigorous
Browning and le* your chidren be
educated here. We have the best,
climate, the grandest scenery and

Every member of our tribe

Our white friends have organized
in many communities to encourage
this local loyalty.

LOCAL PASTOR DELIVERS
"SAFETY FIRST" SERMON
The Christian ages have wit
nessed a growing conviction of
the worth of the average man.
Hence the widespread revulsion
against the mainia and killing
so prevalent in the industrial
world. The toil of killed and
wounded is as follows: 35,000
killed, and 2,000,000 wounded
each year. That is to say,
every hour 232 workman are
killed or injured. If we rekon
on the basis of 300 working days
of eight hours each, the figures
mean a workman killed every
4 minutes, and a injured work
man over 4 seconds, If
all the facts were known it is
safe to say that the annual
deaths from industrial accidents
reach the appalling proportions
of 50,000 each year. Statistics
show that Montana has the
highest morality of any state
in the union, namely, 129 for
each 100,000 population.
How can this dreadful loss
and sorrow be reduced? To
answer this question some of
the brightest minds in present
day industry have Inaugurated
the "Safety First" crusade, al
together the most creditable
enterprise to the brain and
heart of America that has ap
peared for many a day.
Without knowing the facts
we are too inclined to harsh
criticism, very frequently at
taching blame where it does not
belong. Rather than whole
sale denunciation of railroads
for wrecks and disaster.-, let us
once in a while, ask ourselves
how we may assist these great
agents of moden life and hap
piness in safeguarding the lives
of their armies of employees,
as well as the lives of the ever
increasing army of those who
travel.
Accidents, however, are not
confined to railroad travel. In
deed, to those acquainted with
the the facts, it is known that
one is safer on the railroad than
by any other means of travel.
Accidents are constantly oc
curring on the farm, in the
home, on the streets of our
cities towns, and villages—ac
cidents whose only excuse is
carelessness. Order, system,
discipline, in the home and the
school will go far to educate a
generation trained in the prac
tice of attention, including the
willingness and ability to carry
Gas Welt at Havre
The quest for gas by the
Havre Oil & gas company
proved successful on last Sun
day, when at a depth of ap
proximate eleven hundred feet
a flow of natural gas was struck
that equalled if not surpassed
in volume that of the first com
mercial well penetrated in the
Havre field—15 million feet
daily. Measurements of " t h e
volume have been made, it is
understood, but The Plaindealer
could not reach anyone in au
thority to ascertain the figures.
It is from this well that the
Mutual Gas Co., recently grant
ed a franchise to pipe the city,
expects to get its supply of
natural gas. It is understood
the new company has ordered
the necessary pipe for the sys
tem, and that the work of lay
ing the pipe line will begin just
as soon as the material arrives.
Under the franchise as granted,
the Mutual is committed to a
maximum charge of 15 cents
per thousand feet for domestic
use, which if carried out will
give this city the cheapest gas
out orders.
The swiftness of the age in
which we are living teaches the
supreme lesson of Sobriety; and
this does not mean moderate
drinking, but total abstinence
from all intoxicants. If modern
life is to be safe for its members
there must be sobriety. Every
one of us needs to have all his
faculties about him, the demand
for efficiency is so severe, and
terrible. Whether one drives c
locomotive, a team, or an auto,
or whether he is the modest pe
destrian trving to get out oi
the argument is the same—he
needs to be sober. This is a
gasoline age: booze and gasoline
don't mix.
We haven't gotten far enough
along in the evolutionary pro
cess to expect masculinity to
give up the weed; yet it is no
secret the damage done by half
lighted cigars and cigarettes
carelessly tossed aside. One
illustration will suffice. Every
one is familiar with the burn
ing mines of Pennsylvania. For
fiftv years or more these coal
mines have been burning, defy
ing all efforts to put them out.
Vast acre of the best coal in th<_
world have given their treasures
to the winds. Miners have
gone to their doom, entire towns
have been wiped out, from the
fire now engages the heart of
the coal bed. But still the fire
burns. Still it takes a toll in
human life. Still fortunes are
b?ing spent to save the veins
yet untouched. How did the
fire originate? it is said, from a
miner's pipe.
"Am I my brother's keeper?"
This question, scornfully asked
by the first murderer, can be
answered in only one way.
The New Testament gives the
answer: "We are members one
of another." We are inextrica
cably bound together in t h e
great bundle of life. No one
can recklessly throw away or
waste his life without injuring
all the rest of us.
Join the ranks of the safety
enthusiasts today, so that the
record of the decade will be
written not in the blood of the
of the neediessly killed and
wounded, but in the shining
letters of new achievement in
the safeguarding of human life
and limb, and in the raising of
standard of which all Ameri
oans will be proud.

tain that the exercises will be

The Baccalaureate
Sermon
(Contributed)
Last Sunday night, at t h e
Presbyterian church, Rev.
James D. Gold, D. D., of Brown
ing, preached the Baccalaureate
sermon to the graduating class
of the high school before a large
audience of relativesand friends
of the graduates. A Trio was
sung by members of the choir
and the congregational singing
was of a hearty nature.
Dr. Gold's sermon was crisp
and bright and was well re
ceived by those present. He
defined education a s a n im
pulse to research and observa
tion, which is derived from con
tact with the teacher and the
facts acquired in school. He
^ave a rapid sketch of the great
teachers of the past and pres
ent, beginning with Socrates
and Aristotle and coming down
to Horace Mann, Thomas Ar
nold, Mark Hopkins and James
McCash. The educational im
pulse leads to travel, history,
science and all sorts of sacrifice
in the interest of discovery and
invention. Ernest Shackleton,
Langley and the Wright broth
ers were cited as shining exam
ples. Altogether, the sermon
was characterized by deep
thought, wide reading and apt
illustration from personal ex
perience that made it a treat to
all who heard it.

Gas and Oil
on Blackfeet
Standard Oil]Co. Desirous
of jExploring UpperMilkQ
River Country
Quoting a government official
now located on the Blackfeet
reservation, the Great Falls
Leader of last Saturday contain
ed an article to the effect that a
representative of the Standard
Oil Co. had recently made a
proposition t o.th e Blac kfeet ]In
diari Council, to the/effectj that
if permission could .j bejsecured
from this council to explore the
upper Milk river section in quest
of oil, this company would ex
pend one million dollars and if
oil were found would take an
equal chance with other oil com
panies in negotiating for the
development of same.
The Standard's representative
conveyed the impression, ac
cording to this interview, that
the dome of the great oil and
gas belt ol' northern Montana
was in the upper Milk River
region and since the Rockefeller
wizards seldom g o wrong i n
their calculations and do not go
chasing wild-cat ideas, it is
pretty safe to conclude that
this representative has pretty
certain knowledge of the exist*
ence of gas and oil—taking for
granted that the Leader story
has a basis in fact.
A meeting of the Blackfeet
Council was to take place on
May 17th, to consider the mat*
ter, but nothing has been learn
ed as to whether such a meet
ing was held.
