is not troubled with bugs The high
price of all agricultural chemicals
will Justify this experiment

Commencement Is a shining mile
post In the lives of overy graduate
from tho high schools of this broad
land Everybody with love In their
souls goes out to tho boys and girls
who have worked by day and night
over the books and lessons assigned
them until they have finished their
course Tho nine young folks of
Washlngtonvllle who will receive their
diplomas Thursday night this week
are Drma Culler Ella Dalrymple
Thelma Bossert Abble Smith Ollvo
Fynes Alva Senior Marie Warner
Blanche Heintzelman and Loron A
Taylor In addition to the compli
ments that may be passed upon tho
graduates themselves their teachers
Should not bo Overlooked especially
to Miss Mary Fitzsimmons of the high
school department Is duo tho credit
of a great anxiety towards her pupils
to see that they mako satisfactory ex
hibits at tho closing exercises Not
every school even those of greater
pretentious have an auditorium so
well equipped as that of Washlngton
vllle thanks to the architect and tho
local board of education The Carroll
ton school building has 1G rooms and
no auditorium PJty Pupils in the
Washlngtonvllle schools and their
parents who have made such sacri
fices for their children have the
comforting assurance that they are
getting as thorough training so far as
tho grades go as any other school in
Ohio They may not recite iattn
Greek or Pennsylvania Dutch which
Is of no practical u to the average
student yet this years graduating
class I daro say will have as good
a show In the great struggle for exist
ence In ten years hence as It they had
graduated from Rayen Kent or the
O S U much of their success de
pending upon the use they make of
their time Her alumni of graduates
compare very favorably with schools
of greater pretentions and I imagine
that I could select one boy and one
cirl from this years graduating class
who in tho years to come will excel
many who have been turned out or
Salem Leetonia Lisbon and other
city schools Let us hope
