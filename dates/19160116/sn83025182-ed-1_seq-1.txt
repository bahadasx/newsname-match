At the moment the first rescuers
descended into1 the wrecked and
turning interior, Navy Secretary Dan
iels was just standing up to begin his
address before the Democratic club
la Manhattan. At his side was Rear
Admiral Usher, commandant of the
Brooklyn navy yard.
Inside the EV2 the rescuers found
chaos. The uninjured men were bat
tling with the flames and dragging
out the dead and wounded. Lieuten
ant Commander Charles M. Cooke,
the only commissioned officer aboard
at the time of the explosion and who
*M on the tiny E boat deck within a
few feet of where the two men were
blown into the fir, stood where he
was and calmly directed the work of
rescue and fire fighting.
Pieces of human flesh, bits of bone
and tatters of clothing and personal
effects and tools and a hodge-podge
cf other things, were blown through
the open conning tower and hatch
ways, hundreds of feet into the air,
and away from the scene of the explo
sion. Workmen who did not arrive,
in time to join the first rescue party,
gathered up and kept as souvenirs
these things as they found them. It
seemed but a few minutes after the
stckenlng boom of the first explosion
that four ambulances were drawn up
and the dead and Injured were being
loaded Into them. The clouds of
white tmokp that had belched from
the round openings in the ovul steel
*ea lighter bad given way to curling
gray fumes had the stench of burning
human flesh. The injured appeared
dead as they were hauled up through
the small iron mouth of the death
trap, blackened, bleeding- and un
conscious.

help him "to go and get the others."
In the midst of the rescue work, Ad
miral Usher arrived, having left the
political meeting immediately when
h« waa told of the accident, ije or
outsiders excluded and in

-Secretary Daniels announced that
an immediate and thorough inquiry
would be instituted. Usher's board of
insuiry report will be given Daniels
who will authorize a court investiga
tion which Usher will appoint. The
work of this court. Usher said, should
be well under way Monday.
"This is the first accident of the
kind the Brooklyn yard ever has had,"
Bald Usher. "The real cause of it
probably will not be learned until the
official inquiry is reported. The E-2
has been In the drydock here since
December 30, when she came in to
be cleaned up. She is one of the old
style submarines. As the new Edi
son nickel storage lottery which the
department hoped-would obviate such
undersea disasters as that of the F-4
in Honolulu harbor last" March had
just been delivered to us, we decided
to inBtall a set of them In the E-2 for
a final try-out.
"We had tested these batteries and
the Edison people had tested them in
every conceivable manner \q be sure
they would stand up and we were sat
isfied they would, but wanted to make
this final test to make assurance
doubly sure.
"What we wanted was a storage
battery which would not cause the
generation of chlorine gas when
flooded with sea water. It was chlor
lne gas from flooded batteries that
caused the F-4 disaster, not .by an ex
plosion, but by the asphyxiating qual
ity of the chlorine gas. It could not
possibly have been the explosion of
chlorine gas that caused the explo
sion on the E-2 because the boat was
in the dry dock and the batteries
were out of reach of sea water. All
the openings of the E-2 were free,
and I do not think enough gas cduld
have been generated to cause an ex
plosion of such force as this one pos

Jan. 16.—The Berlin newspapera £,

the British proposal to submtv. ne
Baralong case to a court compos^ of
American naval officers. The govern
ment's decision to adopt reprisals be
cause of the alleged murder of a sub

steamer was warmly applauded in the

The press generally takee the view
that the English proposal was an
evasion, declaring that no sea-faring
man would acquit the Baralong mur
derers.
"The German suggestion that the
Baralong murderers be Judged by
English officers is correct," said the
Vossische ieltung, which declared
that the most shocking phases of the
cases had not been printed In the
English press.
"There is still Justice on earth,"
said the Lokal Anzelger. "This ought
to be known by the Baralong mur
derers and by their protectors."
Other papers declared- the British
reply seemed to take.the whole affair
as a Joke. Count Westarp, speaking
in the relchstag, declared the Bara
