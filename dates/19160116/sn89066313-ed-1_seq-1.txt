Baptists of Missouri Would
Raise Fund of Si, 500,000
for Schools.
SOMK TO EVKRY ONE
Each of Church's Colleges
Would Receive Large
Share.
A iiuatter of a million dollars is the
p.trt that Stephens College t-vpects to
get. if the $l..".Mi.nm which Missouri
Baptists hope to raise for colleges in
the state is secured. The same allot
ment to Hardin College at .Mexico is
proposed, while William Jewell Col
lege at Liberty would receive twice
as much.
These plans were made liv a special
committee appointed from the thirty I
members of the general educational j
committee named by the Haptist ocn- j
cral Association meeting held at
Trenton, Mo., last year to look after j
the church's educational affairs in the
state. The special committee was ap
pointed to look into the needs of the
various colleges. It proposed the plan
of raising the fund of a million and a
half after a meeting in Kansas City
last week, to which the presidents of
all Baptist colleges in Missouri were
summoned.
The plan that will probably be fol
lowed, if the campaign is started for
raising the money, will be to employ
John S. Lyons, a rationally known
educator, to manage the campaign
Mr. Lyons is now engaged in a cam
paign at Sioux Falls, la., and will meet
the soecial committee in St. Iuis
soon after that campaign is closed,
January 23.

couldn't send their men corsage bou

ridiculous with one of those things

they did send flowers Vhe kind you
put in your button-hole. One of the
men tied bis flowers around his arm
just as the girls sometimes do.
The men tried to make the most of
their opportunity. It was a favorite
pastime for one of
the boys, when he
was standing near a
girl, to drop his
handkerchief just
liko that so the
girl could pick it up.
But the girls were
equal to every emer

the dance ended they escorted the men
to their homes.
It was a very successful party, this

the girls declare they, too, had a "won
