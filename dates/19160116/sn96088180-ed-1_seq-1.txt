It was difficult to secure a com
plete list of the survivors and in
jured by reason of the confusion at
tending the rescue work. Ptve or
, six ficrsons are Ibelloved to bave keen
brought to the city on launches and
tugs and to have been sent to their
; homes In various parts of the city
before a check could be made. One
report states that 1 8 passengers were
on board the Victor, besides the crow
of three, when she left Old Town.
If this Is corroct, the death list will
be Increased.
Captain Wood, however, Is posl
tlvo that only three were drowned.
The wreck occurred whon the
Vlotor was about a mile and a half
off Point Defiance, bound for North
Bay ports, and was caused, pas
sengers say, when a sudden squall
from the north struck the vessol and
caused her cargo of lumber to shift.
This heeled the little boat over and
allowed the water to pour Into the
M' cabin through the open wln
'Bows. The engine room was floodod
and tho iboat Immediately began to
slowly sink. Panlo selxed tho pas
scngors and a wild rush for the
upper deck, whore the lifcthoat
swung at Its davits, was made. Men
frantically kicked and pounded at
tho windows to gain tholr freedom
from the rapidly tilling cabin.
Finally the lifeboat was succoss
fully launched, but not until several
of the passengers had been thrown
or fallen Into the Icy waters of Pugct
' . sound. Soino were held up by hastily
donned life preservers. At this time
tho steamer Atalantn, passing nearby,
was attracted by the signals of dls
, tress and made hasto to come to tho
rescue. Lifeboats were lowered and
those struggling In the water wore
taken on board and lator Ibrought to
the municipal dock In Tacoma.
' All were suffering from cuts,
caused (by breaking window glnss In
( the cabin of the sinking ship, and
; from exposure to the Intenso cold.
I Wm. Clark collapsed from exhaus-
tlon and Immersion In the Icy waters
' and was unconscious when taken on

Rome, Jan. 16. 'While the Aus
trian ring of Iron has compelled eva
cuation of tho Montenegrin capital,
Cettlnje, tho diplomatic corps has
fled that city and reached Scutari,
Albania, according to Austrian ad
vices via Munich today.
Montenegrin stragglers are like
wise entering Albania to escape cap
ture. Meantime, Montenegrin guer
illas are harassing the victorious
Austrian and bloody fighting Is In
progress northeast of Bcutaii.
The whereabouts of King Nicholas
and his force, which withdrew from
t'ettlnje, is a mystery, but it is be
lieved the sovereign Is heading for
Scutari, where he will negotiate con
cerning the proposed separate peace
with Austria.
Tbe Cettlnje forces were virtually
surrounded at last reports. Their
only path of retreat Is along a 45
ii) lie gap to the south, leading
through the northern Albanian
mountains, where hostile Albanians
would attack them.
It la believed here that the hope
lessne of. the situation prompted
King Nicholas to accept an armUtlee
with Austria, though reports as to
this are still unconfirmed.
Pessimism over the consequent
blow to Italian prestige In the Adria
tic was somewhat dispelled today
with news that tho French aubmarlne
Foucault, attached to the Italian
fleet, had sunk an Austrian scout
cruiser of the Navara type.

PETROGRAD REPORT
(By United Press Leased Wire.)
London, Jan. 15. Tho Austrian
lost 100.000 men, Including 10,000
prisoners, lu the recent Russian
offensive, according to the Chronicle's
retrograd messages today.
How deeperato was the Austrlans'
plight was indicated from tho fact
that tho Austrian general, Bothmor,
to keep bis trooiw from retreating
across tho Strypa river, destroyed
bridges In tbe rear. Then, clinging
to the east bank, the Teutons were
exposed to a tremendous fire from
the Russian artillery.
"The offensive," said the dispatch,
"covered the period when the allies
wire strengthening tholr positions in
the near-east, and it held off the Ger
mans while the work of fortifying
and landing at Salonlkt and evacu
ating Gnlllpoll peninsula went for
ward. So far, It served Its purpose.
Moreover, it warned the Germans
that the Initiative is gradually slip
ping from their grasp." 1

Concerning the $700 payment to

Escap
Without Serious Injury
(By United Press Leased Wire)
New York, Jan. 15. An explosion
which ripped off the top of submarine
E 1 at the Brooklyn navy yard, is
known to have claimed four lives,
and perhaps others. Stories outside
the yard said, indeed, that five men
had perished outright in the blast,
and that upwards of 15 were prob
ably fatally Injured. Officers re
fused information of the disaster un
til the list of victims has been pre
pared, but It was unofficially admit
ted that "over three or four" were
killed.
Trouble with batteries was assign
ed as the cause. A wave of flame
swept the interior of the undersea
vessel Just after the exploslou, trap
ping the men in the hull, and leaving
the manholes in the rear as the only
means of escape.
Some of the Injured appeared
dead, and tor a time it was Impos
sible to tell Just how badly they
were hurt, because black smoke and
grime covered their wounds Aand
made them appear almost like char
red bodies.
It was believed that probably
many of the crew of 35, most of
whom were aboard when the blast
came, were seriously burned as they
fought their way through the smoke
and flame filled diver to the exits.
Some of those who fought their way
to the outside were cloaked in
flames.
The submarine was at the yard for
repairs. When it became apparent
that the accident mleht have been
more serious than at first indicated,
the navy yard was closed. The offi
cials withheld authoritative Informa
tion and cloaked the whole affair
In mystery.
The explosion Is the second dis
aster of recent months aboard United
States undersea vessels. The other
Incident was the sinking of thV F-4
at Honolulu with all her crew aboard.
The commandant declared later
that his list showed the following
dead:
Plumber Logan.
John Sohultz, yard workman.
Two unidentified . men, one of
whom was an enlisted sailor.
Ten men were Injured,' among
whom was Chief Electrician Miles,
whose condition Is critical. Officers
sold there would be a further search,
but It Is believed that all the bodice
were taken out: ,
Secretary of the Navy Daniels,
who was In New York to make a
speech, Is believed to havo one to
Brooklyn as soon as ho heard of the
explosion.
