C. E. Oaks and His Spn Retire From
New Statel Company.
At the annual meeting of' the stock
holders of the New State Hardware
and Harness company, held on the
11th of this month, W. W. Clemens
was elected president, manager and
treasurer; J. D. Clemens, a non resi
dent, was chosen vice president, and
Clarence Atkins, who has been with
the company for some time, was
elected secretary. C. E. Oakes Sr.
and C. E.. Oakes Jr. have both re
tired from the business.
Mr. Clemens came to this city six
years ago last December. Since that
time he has built up a very lucrative
business. A vast warehouse has been
built to' accommodate a portion of
the stock and the company has had
a very prosperous timo under his
management.
ARDMORE TtACHER PROMOTED.
L ' Mnn,i;,v mnmino- as teacher
L. penmanship in the State Central
Normal. Miss Jones has taught here
for several years in the primary de
partment and has had charge of the
teaching of penmanship in all the
schools. She will get a better salary
in her new position and she will
have a full year's work Instead of
nine months, which she has enjoyed
here. The promotion is a deserved
one. Miss Jones is a careful, pains
taking teacher. President Choiles
Evans of the Central Norman knows
her and knows her work, and it was
duo to that fact that she was given
the place at Edmond.

THIRTEEN BUILDINGS DESTROY
ED IN THE OIL FIELD TOWN
EARLY SATURDAY MORNING,
ENTAILING SEVERE LOSSES.
Fire which started at 2 o'clock Sat
urday morning in t tie H:r1i rooming
house nt Wirt, In the Healdton fields,
destroyed thirteen buildings and will
result in the loss of one life. The
flames started in the High rooming
house and Miss High, aged 23 years,
is so badly burned that she can not
recover. The district between the
Central garage and the Frick-K.eid
supply house on tho north side of
Main street was destroyed. Among
the places burned are the High room
ing house, Wirt rooming house. Five
Bros, casing crew bunk house, Webb's
boarding house, navies rooming
house, Cherry & Real's boarding
house, Avalon rooming house, C. P.
Hall's furniture store, Palace room
ing house and Davis' grocery store.
The Wall furniture store was owned
by C. P. Hall of Ardmore. His loss
is estimated at $3,500. Some of the
merchandise was saved, but the
pieces removed from the building are
nearly all damaged. The Davis gro
cery store was a new store. Mr.
Davis recently moved to Wirt from
Healdton. The loss on the Cherry
& Deal boarding house was estimated
at $1,200. The rooming houses were
full of occupants when the fire oc
curred and very few of them saved
any clothing.. -The buildings were
of pine and burned furiously. The
temperature was seven degrees be
low freezing and those made home
less suffered from the cold. Those
citizens whose homos were not de
stroyed were generous in providing
shelter for the unfortunates. Imme
diate medical 'attention was given
the young woman who suffered from
burns. j
The fire swept a part of the town
that was burned last spring and one !
coincidence is that the same number j
of houses were destroyed yesterday i
morning that were destroyed in the
fire last spring.

ANTHRACITE
GOAL MINERS
WANT RAISE
GOV'S MESSAGE
PRACTICALLY
COMPLETED
DESIRED LEGISLATION WILL BE
DEFINITELY SET FORTH WILL
INCLUDE SUFFRAGE .AND HIGH
WAY LAW.
Oklahoma City, Okla., Jan. 15. Cov
entor Williams has practically com
pleted his first message, to be deliver
ed to the special session of the legis
lature on Its opening day next Mon
day. The message will set forth with
definiteiiess and specifically the action
that is deemed necessary in the opin
ion of the executive on the several
subjects that aie to be included in
its purview.
An instance of the definiteiiess is
shewn in the reference that is to be
made to the state highway law. That
measure will probably require amend
ments In a number of sections. The
governor will set forth each section of
the law that he would have amended
and suggest the changes that are re
quired. He will specifically withhold
from consideration all other portions
of the law. This subdivision of sub
jects that is to be made by the gover
nor in submitting matters for consid
eration under the constitution is ex
pected to operate more advantageously
to the shortening of the session than
any other method that could be adopt
ed. Whether the power of the gover
nor to submit only parts of subjects
is definite or not, there seems to be
little probability of the legislature at
tempting to consider other matters,
as they are with the governor in de
ti.ii.g a speedy adjournment of the
session.
It is understood that Governor Wil
liams will disappoint the Oklahoma
City people and others who want the
eapltal question opened up at the
special session, so that provision may
be made for a dome at this time. The
dome is not an emergency matter, and
it will cost about a quarter of a mil-
lion dollars when built. Governor Wil
liams is submitting only emergency
matters at thissession, and he is not
looking for places to spend large sums
of money.
The general plan for a law in part to
take the place of the defunct grand
father clause by the coming special
session of the legislature Is to require
a general registration of all voters at
a period several months prior to any
election and to impose certain literacy
tests as a prerequisite to registration.
The details of this plan are being
worked out by members of the two
houses of the legislature. The alter
native of divorcing state elections from
those at which members of congress
are chosen seems to have had little
consideration and to be unpopular,
save as a possible last resort or the
party leaders.

YARD AT BROOKLYN-THREE DEAD
MYSTERY SURROUNDS EXPLOSION OF SUBMARINE E-2,
WHICH HAD BEEN IN DRY DOCK SINCE DECEMBER
THIRTIETH, UNDERGOING REPAIRS. THERE ARE
THREE KNOWN DEAD.
One Body Recovered, and Two of the Injured Died Soon after
the Accident in the Hospital Crew at Work Were En
gaged in Installing New Edison Batteries Newspaper
Men Were Barred from Navy Yards Immediately Follow
ing Explosion Several Plates of Vessel Parted, and Gas
Fumes from Vessel Rendered Unconscious Several Of
ficers Attempting to Enter the Wrecked Craft Work on
Vessel Was in Charge of Lieutenant M. Cooke, Jr., Com
mander of the Submarine, who Escaped Uninjured Rear
Admiral Usher, After Spending Some Time at Scene, Told
Newspaper Men that Explosion Occurred While Edison
Batteries Were Being Discharged or Emptied.
over a quarter of a million dollars of
the stock of the association had been
sold during the past six months; that
the association now as $:!0,000.00 cash
on hand, but bus applications for loans
in excess of $:12,0U0.00. There is a
membership of 111, whose monthly
dues amount to over $1,000.00 each
month.
The secretary reported that all tho
prepaid stock and deposit stock which
the directors thought wise to put on
the market had been sold, and that he
belelved, $50,000.00 more of cash could
be secured at nny time by the sale of
prepaid and deposit stock whenever
the association might find itself ln
need of additional funds.
The stockholders seemed highly elat
ed over the excellent report of tho
secretary.
J The board of directors met in reg
ular session the following day, and af
ter the minutes of the previous meet
ing were read, the old board adpourned
sine die, and the new board assumed
chargo of affairs. The following of
ficers were elected: Frank S. Cates,
president; Kenett Hudson, vice presi
dent: II. C. Potterf. attorney, K. IS.
Olivers, treasurer; O. P. Selvidge, sec
retary. .
Every member of tho board was
present except Mr. Kennett Hudson
who was sick, and Dr. Martin who re
sides out of town. The meeting was
most enthusiastic as the directors now
feel that the association has reached
that magnitude which will enable it
to take care of all city loans and can
fully meet every demand that a city
the size of Ardmore can make upon a
building and loan association.
The stock of the association is ap
pealing to the business men of Ard
more as an investment that furnishes
the muxmiuin security with the maxi
mum earning power of money, and
the directors expect that It will only
be a short time now until all of the
stock of the association has been pur
chased. The two new directors, Mr.
Dings and Mr. Apple, each purchased a
'block of $10,000.00 of the btock ai;d
j will in all probability take larger
blocks a little later on.
An extra effort will be made, how
ever, during the coming year to inter
est the small investor, as every clerk,
bookkeeper, stenographer and salaried
person in Ardmore ought to have some
of t'.ie stock of the association, and lay
asida each month a percentage of their
earnings.
Five dollars per month will mature
$1,000.00 in ten years. Most any sal
aried person In Ardmore can save this
amount if they will only make up
their mind to do so, and it Is to this
class that the directors and secretary
are going to direct their attention the
ensuing year.
