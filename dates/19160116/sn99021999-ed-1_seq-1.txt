MRS. HAUSER MAKES ADMISSION
After five hours' deliberation ovet
the guilt or innocenco of Arthur
Hauser, accused of the murder of W.
H. Smith, the jury in Judgo English's
court last night acked the bailiff for
cigars, apparently indicating that
they were prepared for a long stay.
The request was made at 8:45
o'clock.

leading a reckless life and thought
It was time the restraint of the law
Should he put upon him.
Case to Jnrr at 3i40 P. M.
The case of the ' State against
Arthur Hauser went to the Jury at

arrived the jurors still were delib
erating over the issue whether
Hauser shot to death W. H. Smith.

A vigorous and logical speech by
County Attorney Magney, who
closed the case for the state, left the
bandit despondent.
"It will be a death verdict." he
told Sheriff McShane after he had
been led from the court room for
the last time before the Jury decides
his fate. "The Jury will be. out two
hours and the verdict will be death."
The Jury took with it into the
Jury room three blank forma for a
verdict. One was for conviction
with the death penalty', 'one for con
viot'on with life UMMPSAt .EBd
one for acquittal.

More than a score and a half of murder
Juries, including those in many noted
eases, have been under the charge of the
veteran bailiff during the last quarter of
a century.
The lest hours of the trial found all
the prinlcipal characters of the murder
drama in the court room. The dead
man's wife and mother and two children
sat In the spectators' seats. Their heads
were bowed and they were weeping. The
wife and mother and baby of the bandit
on trial for Ms life, were close to him.
The mother, 60 years old, was In tears
and held her handkerchief to her face.
Mrs. May Hauser sat motionless. Many
friends of W. H. Bmith were in the court
room. Including more than ICO persona
from Council Bluffs, his home during his
lifetime. The remainder of the spectators
who overcrowded the court room were
entertainment seekers and were equally
ready to smile or weep as circumstances
might dictate.
County Attorney Magney remarked art
he opened his argument that he had been
surprised when he heard the arguments
of the three attorneys on the other side
of the table to find that they could make
so much out of so little. He analyzed all
theo vldcnce, declared It proved Hauser
guilty and that the murderer of Smith
deserved the extreme penalty.

ELMER J. BURKETT.
BURKETT OUT FOR
YICEPRESIDENT
Former Congressman and Senator
of Lincoln Announces He Will
Enter Name in Race.
WEST SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED
(From a Staff Correspondent.)
LINCOLN, Jan. 15. (Special.)
After hesitating whether to run for
president or for senator, ex-Senator
E. J. Burkett of Lincoln will
file as a candidate for the vice presi
dency. This is the announcement
made by him this afternoon to news
paper representatives called to his
office to hear of his decision.
Senator Burkett says he will make
a campaign for support in the west,
which, though it has for years
elected solid delegations for repub
lican presidents, has never been
recognized on a national republican
ticket. ,
Senator Burkett served In the Nebraska
legislature and then was elected to con-
cress from the First distrlat. Re-elected
three times congressman, he reslarned the
last term when elected by the Nebraska. I
legislature to the United States senate,
from which he retired after one term.
Following is l.ls announcement, as pre
pared, for .he press, over his name:.
"To the Poople of Nebraska: 1 am
profoundly Impressed with the expres
sions of confidence and esteem from my
fellow citizens of this and other states,
and am particularly, grateful to the peo
ple., of-Nebraska for. their generosity, .to
me during the twenty years since I en
tered public life, and for their renewed
and continued expressions of layalty and
confidence at this time. After consid
erable reflection, I have decided to yield
to the. entreaties of my friend and
authorise my name to be used as a can
didate for vice president of the United
States. The near approach of the date
of our Nebraska primaries seems to re
quire that I make this announcement at
this time.
"In doing so I am not unapprcclatlve
of the high honor, nor unmindful of the
great duties and responsibilities that at
tend the position; neither as I unmindful
of the claims of other men and other
portions of the country for recognition;
nor yet, indeed, have I overlooked the
disadvantages geographical and numer
ical that confront a candidate from any
western state in a national convention.
Indeed, I have not yielded to this call
because of any right or claims of my
own, nor from personal ambition alone;
nor because the way seemed easy or the
burdens light; but rather because it has
seemed to those who have Importuned
me to become a candidate that my twelve
years of service In the American con
gress, six years of which were spent in

Mrs, Doane Reproaches Ornahans
for Giving Shoes with the Soles Out
"l don't think it is fair to send us old
shoes with the soles nearly off, under
wear with holes large enough for a cow
to walk through, or other garments with
trimmings and buttons all removed," said
Secretary Iioane of the Associated Chari
ties. She said this in all kindness and
yet with earnestness.
"While we appreciate the good inten
tions of those who send us bundles of
shoes and clothing, yet It would surprise
jou to know how many of these articles
are pra'ttally worthless, .lust because
a man comes to us and asks for a pair of
shoes for the protection of his feet while

150 feet away. ,
The Injured men and one body were
removed soon after the accident, but
three bodies far down In the craft, could
not be reached until the gas had been
blown out by compressed air. Soon after
the explosion several naval officers led
a rescue-"party Into jjUe.'dry.JJock, but

the vessel. It waa then that compressed
air pipes were run Into the shell, and

The number of men Inside the subma

definitely known. About twenty were
working on the craft, but all of them
were not on the underwater boat at
the same time. It Is not thought pos
sible that anyone who was inside could
have escaped Injury.
What caused the explosion has not
been definitely decided. Rear Admiral
Nathaniel R. Usher, commandant of the
navy yard after an examination of the
craft and Questioning workmen, who had
been nesrby, declined to express an
opinion. He said:
"The men were at work in the battery

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 15,-John D.
Spreckels. Jr., member of a wealthy
California family, spent the day In Jail
at Kedwood City, thirty miles south of
here, serving sentence for not having
dimmed the lights on his automobile when
pafslng through that municipality.
George Seely, Justice of the peace, in
imposing sentence, said that a money
fine would be absurd and quoted Brreck
els as saying he would not pay one with
out fighting It in the court. He made
the sentence two days In Jail.
Kpreckels claimed that he had dimmed
his lamps with tobacco juice and that a
policeman in San Franciaco had told him
this would be satisfactory.
"That policeman was wrong, wasn't
he?" demanded Spreckels of his secre
tary after receiving sentence.
"He was," replied the secretary and
went out to see about meals.
"I am Just a plain man and want to
observe the law," preckela said. "This
law, however, should be amended so that
a man automatically could dim his lights
when necesary and turn them on full
in the lone stretches of the country."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. On thee re
Quest , of .Senator Stone, Secretary Lan
sing today agreed to keep the senate con
stantly and promptly Informed regarding
Mexican developments, and also to hasten
preparation of Information regarding the
Carranza government. In answer to Sen
ator Kail's resolution.
Senator Stone told Secretary Tensing the
foreign relations committee particularly
desired to keep In close touch with Mex
ican developments. He called attention
to criticisms lately made In the senate.
Intimating that Mexican affairs had been
clothed with secrecy.
"I also urged upon the secretary the
Importance of the United States having
a diplomatic representative attached to
the Carranza government in this crisis,"
said Senator Htone, "and assured him
that we could do nothing toward con
firmation of Henry P. Fletcher, the pres
ident's nominee for ambassador to the de
facto government, until the president re
plied to Senator Fall's resolution. The
secretary assured me the data would be
ready early next week. I have called a
meeting of the foreign relations commit
tee for next Wednesday, and hope the in
formation will be ready then.

"Republican senators will not consider
the Fletcher nomination until the presi
dent's answer has been received. One or
two senstors have Indicated that they
would not vote to send an ambassador
to Carranza at ell." Senator Fall says he
will never vote to confirm the nomination
because he regards Carransa as an unfit
man to head the de facte government.
Senator. Borah has Intimated that he will
oppose confirmation for the reason that
he regards the Carranza government as
ephemeral.
"L.i1'. a majority of the semtorp, I think,
agree with me that it Is of the utmost
Importance for this government to be
properly represented by recognized diplo
matic agent, and I think that Mr. Fletcher
can be confirmed after the president ex
plains the recognition of Carranza and
describes the de lacto government."
