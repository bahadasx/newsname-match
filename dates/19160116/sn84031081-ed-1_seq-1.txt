failure of the blockade by showing
too much consideration for neutrals.

the vessel's shell that there was no

of recovering the bodies could bo com

The Injured men and one l.odv wore

(Soon after the explosion several naval
officers led a rescue party into the
drydock but woro partly overcome by
fia fumes when they attempted to
descend Into the vessel. It was then
that compressed air pipes were run
'Into the shell and the gas forced out.
j The number of men inside the sub

not definitely known. About twenty
were working on the craft but all ot
tli'iu were not on tho underwater

thought possible, that any one who
was Inside could linvo escaped Injury,

been definitely decided. Hoar Ad

said:
"The men were at work in the but
