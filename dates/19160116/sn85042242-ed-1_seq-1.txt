GERMANY CAN FIGHT
FOR MANY YEARS
Says Sweden's Attitude Is One of
Strict Neutrality Toward
Belligerents.
Berne, Switzerland, Jan. 1!».—'Baron
Adelsward, former minister of Fi­
nance of Sweden and now a member
of the Swedish Rigsdaig, is one of
the outstanding figure's of the peace
movement in Europe—not the peace
movement that seeks to intervene or
stop the present war, for the belli­
gerent governments have made it
plain they will have nothing to do
with that and will settle peace in
their own way—but that other move­
ment which seeks to pave the way
for a readjustment of the world's af­
fairs, economic, social and interna­
tional,
HO
that when peace at last
comes there will be some assurance
against a recurrence of such a world
disaster as is now going on.
Baron Adelsward is recognized as
a practical man and not an idealist,
and that is what has made him the
practical leader of the present move­
ment. He has recently toured the
countries at war, conferring on this
plan of permanent world peace with
such men as iPremier Asquith in Eng­
land, and President 'Poincare in Fran­
ce, coming here later where his
brother is Swedish minister to Switz­
erland.
IBaron Adelsward gave The Associ­
ated press a vivid picture of condi­
tions in the belligerent countries he
has just visited, and also laid down
the lines on which he is working,
particularly a$" to.jjj&klng the Hague
Court of Arbitration a real force in
tile world's affairs instead of a mere
organization on paper.
Dark Per Peace.
"1 regret to say that the outlook
appears darker during recent months
than at any time since the war be­
gan," said Baron Adelsward. "This
was the result of my observations
throughout the tour or principal
countries participating hi the war.
And for that reason, much as I would
like to see peace, 1 do not believe
there is the slightest chance of peace
at the present time or in the near
future.
"In lEngland," continued E'aron Ad­
elsward, "I found among officials and
the people at large that they look
upon the war as just beginning—yes,
that is their expression—'the war has
just begun.' They recognize now that
they were not ready for war at the
outset, and lacked men and munitions.
But now it has taken firm hold of
the whole people that the war is a
tremendously seriously question, and
they feel-they are only beginning an
effort adequate to the hugh task be­
fore them. iSo that it is useless to
talk peace to them when they are
firmly convinced they are just begin­
ning the war.
"In Frarfce there is indignation at
the mei&iiiention of peace, and the
•whole country ifr united in the policy
of carrying on the-war with the ut­
most energy.
Strong Public Sentiment
"But.3n-G£rmttny there is undoubt­
edly a VBfry strbi»£ public sentiment
for ending' the war. I have made
four trips through Germany since the
war began, and have observed the
gradual growth of feeling that, the
war should end. This was most mark­
ed during my last visit., and extended
to all classes, men and women ex­
claiming: 'My God, who would have
thought this terrible war would last
so long.' The statement of the 'Ger­
man Chancellor, that any effort of
iGermiany for peace is opposed by
Germany's ejiemles, appears to be
designated to calm the public feeling
in Germany in showing that the gov­
ernment is ready for peace but can­
not realize it through the opposition
of the Allies.
"There is, too, a significant and
rather ominous attitude among the
Gterman people, of being ready to
criticise men in high places —even
the highest. Such a thing would not
have 'been thought of a short time
ago, but now it is general.
'"For instance, men who direct lar­
ge forces of employees were recently
discussing the serious conditions
arising from the war.
'The responsible ones will be pun­
ished.' said one.
"l?ut the is responsible, and
will he, too, be punished?'
'Yes, I mean him too he is the
one,', was the reply.
"A*id this is very typical of the
wav the ordinary people are talking,
and it is a condition which might
have the gravest consequences.
Not Exhausted.
"And yet," added Baron Adelsward,
"it is a mistake to think that Ger­
many is exhausted and will be forced
to peace through sheer exhaustion.

Came in Room.
STAY OF SENTENCE
GRANTED TILL WED.
Convicted Man So Confident of

Goodbye.
(ilinneapolisi, 'Minn., j.an. 15.—Fred­
erick T. Price was convicted of mur­
der in the first degree of his wife,
Mary Fridley Price, by a jury that re­
ported to Judge Fish at 12:40 p. m.
today.
Asks -#tay of Sentence.
On motion of M. C. Brady, attorney
for Price, Judge Fish granted a stay
of sentence until Wednesday, when
a motion for a new trial on the
ground of newly discovered evidence
and alleged errors occurring in the
conduct, of the trial will be heard.
Under the verdict, life imprisonment
can be imposed.
Price Was Nervous.
More nervous than he has appear­
ed since the trial began, Price was
led into the court, room five minutes
before the jurors filed in. His hands
trembled and his chin quivered. As
he saw llie crowd I hat filled every
seat, it the small court room, he pull­
ed himself together and outwardly
calm waited while the judge took the
bench and A. 'E. Frost, deputy clerk
of the district court, called the roll
of the Jurors.
"Guilty as Charged."
"Gentlemen, have you agreed on a
verdict?" asked Mr. Frost, and there
was tense silence in the court room
as James C. Bain, first venireman
chosen and the. foreman of the jury,
replied:
"We have."
Eery eye was visited on the pris­
oner as Mr. Frost received the ver­
dict, handed it to Judge Fish, and
then, when the court, had passed it
back, read the words:
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Frederick T. Price, guilty as charged
in the indictment."
During the wait for the verdict,
Price sat at a table, just behind his
attorney, M. O. Brady. Brady was
nervous. Price sat quietly and look­
ed about the room and then casually
at the sober faced jurors.
Was Confident of Acquittal.
'The defendant, who, because of his
calmness throughout the trial, had
acquired the title of "iron man," lis­
tened to the reading of the verdict
with no show of emotion. So confi­
dent of acquittal had he been that he
had packed his belongings and said
good-bye to jail attendants.
The jury was out nearly 20 hours.
CHILDREN KILLED BY
AIR BOMBSHELL
Cologne, via London, Jan. 16.—Ten
children who were playing in a gravel
pit near the local aviation grounds,
were killed today by an air boirio.
The children found the unexploded
bomb and were playing with it when
it exploded. The district in the vi­
cinity of the aviation field had been
repeatedly searched after bombs had
been dropped by the aviators. It is
probable that the bomb found by the
children had been driven into the
ground and only became exposed by
the heavy rains of the last fewdays.

Resignation Filed With School
Board Saturday After­
noon.
TAKES EFFECT AT END
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR
Has Been Superintendent for Six
Years Future Plans Not
Decided.
Saturday afternoon Superintendent
Charles C. Root of tho Bismarck
schools filed his resignation with the
president of the school board. The
act came as a surprise to the people
of tho city. The resignation is dated
January 1, and is to take effect at the
end of the present school year.
Here Six Years.
Mr. Root 'has been superintendent
of tli^Tfifsiifiafck 'scTrobl's for six years.
In al!f Mat lime he has labored'in­
cessantly to improve and build up ti.e
school system of Bismarck to its
highest possible state. At the end of
the school year. Mr. Root will have
finished 18 years of active school
work. He has not decided as to what
he will do in the future.
Prof. Bolt May Succeed.
Rumor states that Prof. Bolt, who
is principal of the high school, will
succeed Mr. Root, in case the resigna
tfoYi is accepted by tho school hoard.
The Resignation.
Bismarck, N. D., Jan. 1st, 1915.
To the Honorable Board of Educa­
tion:
As the time of year is approaching
when I know you want to begin lay­
ing plans for the coming year, I
should like to present to you at this
time my resignation to take effect at
the end this school year, July 1st,
1916. 1 take this occasion to thank
all those who have acted in the capa­
city of members of the board of edu­
cation during my term of office for
the courtesies extended me, and for
the siBPort which has assisted,jne in
tile upbuilding of the schools.
Perhaps you will permit me at this
time to call your attention to the fact
that the work of supervision of the
Bismarck schools has practically
doubled since the beginning of my
term, six years ago. At that time
there were eighteen teachers in two
buildings now there are thirty-five
teachers in three buildings. The en
rollment in the entire school has in­
creased from 700 to 1,100. In the
high school the number of teachers
has more than doubled, and the en­
rollment increased from 135 to 230.
In installing the many new depart
ments, much extra time has been re­
quired for their organization, and for
the selection of the best equipment
for the money available. In addition
to this the various activities which
have centered around the new high
school building have occupied a large
share of time outside of school hours.
Our reward for the strenuous work
has been in the growing appreciation
for the Bismarck schools among the
residents of our own city, and in the
increasing reputation of our schools,
which is attracting students from all
the western part of the state.
The past six years have been spent,
in' a sincere effort to build up and
improve our school system. While
the work of supervision would have
been better done if there might have
been some assistance in the routine
of office work, we trust that the
board of education and the people of
Bismarck will feel that the work has
been done conscientiously and with
the best interests of the children of
Bismarck always in mind. Much work
of a constructive nature remains to
be accomplished, but personal inter­
ests and family considerations dic­
tate that I should leave it to another.

President's
Conservation
Bill to Pass
Washington, Jan. 15.—The second
of the administration's conservation
measures, a bill under which more
than 700,000,000 acres of public lands
would be thrown open for lease by
private interests, passed the' house
today without a roll call. Immediate­
ly afterwards, the 640 acres home­
stead bill was taken up with a pros­
pect that it would be passed early
next week.
Advocate State Rights.
Opposition to the land lease bill
was confined principally to far west­
ern representatives, as in the case of
the water power leasing bill passed
last week. Led by Representative
IMortdell of Wyoming, a group of
members from the far western states
opposed particularly in the debate to­
day the provisions under which the
vast oil interests on public lands in
California and Wyoming would be de­
veloped under federal leases. They
contended that each state should be
permitted to regulate development of
such resources Within its borders.

Appartments Will Be Built on

THREE STORY BRICK
TWENTY-FOUR FLATS
Senator E. A. Hughes announced
yesterday that he will erect on his
property at Fourth and Rosser
streets, a modern 24-fiat apartment
building, it will be a three-story
brick structure, oO by 140. The two
houses on the property now will eith­
er be sold and moved off or wrecked
to make room for the improvement.
It is estimated (hat. the building will
cost. $.'0,n00.
There will he three and four-room
apartments, including bathroom and
kitchenette. The kitchenettes will
all be equipped with electric cook
stoves and the building will be heat­
ed from the Hughes central heating
plant.
Three Entrances.
The flat building will have one en­
trance on Fourth and two on Rosser.
It is planned to have the apartments
modem in every way and attractively
finished. The construction will be
fire-proof throughout and work will
begin early this spring, so that the
flats can be ready for occupancy in
the fall.
Announcement already has been
made by F. W. Murpny of the flat
building he will erect near the post
office on Third street. These two
buildings will answer a strong de­
mand in Bismarck for strictly mod­
ern living apartments. There have
been many calls for this type of flats
and many people who desire to make
their homes here have been forced
to go elsewhere.
The indications are bright for a
very active building year in WIG,
Other important structures are under
consideration.
Von Papen's
Mail Involves
High Officials
Washington, Jan. 15.—Disclosures
of alleged activities of German
agents in the United States contain­
ed in the papers seized by the Brit­
ish from Captain von Papen, the for­
mer military attache here, while they
commanded intense interest, have
brought no indication of official no­
tice. The general view is that the
United States government practically
closed the incident when it called for
the, withdrawal of Captain von Papen
and his colleague, Boy-Ed.
Interesting Correspondence.
Much of the correspondence cabled
to this country is looked upon by
most officials as being little more
than interesting. That which pup
ports to be between von Papen and
Wurner Horn is eagerly awaited,
however, as possibly being a link in
the chain of evidence government
agents collected regarding the at­
tempted destruction of the railway
bridge at St. Croix, Maine.

London, Jan. 15.—Only on the Bes
sarabian and East Galician fronts,
and in Montenegro, have there been
recent military developments of
prime importance. The rapid se­
quence of events in the Montenegrin
campaign, involving the crumbling of
the little kingdom"s resistance, pre­
sents, perhaps, the more dramatic as­
pect, but on the larger scale and
greater interest, for the moment, at
least, is the conflict, between the
Russians and Austrians. The Rus­
sian offensive resumed in force alter
a brief halt, is being pressed with
more determination than before. Re­
ports of the fighting so far have come
only from Vienna, but. these indicate
that the attacks against the Austrian
lines were of a desperate character.
Austrians Pursue Montenegrins.
In Montenegro the Austrians, fol­
lowing up their capture of Cettinje,
are pursuing the depleted forces of
King Nicholas and have made addi­
tional captures. The Montenegrins,
according to unofficial advices, after
transferring their capital to Niksic,
determined to make a stand at Reka,
to the southeast of Cettinje, and if
necessary, to continue their retreat
southward and concentrate their de­
fense at Scoutari, Albania. In inter­
ior Montenegro, on the eastern front'
of the fighting in this field of war,
the Austrians have advanced from
Berane and taken the heights of
Gradina to the south.
Quiet In West.
The fighting along the Franco-Bel­
gian lines has not been of moment,
since, the operations in the Cham­
pagne, started by the German offen­
sive movement there, came to a halt.
A German air raid on Saloniki,
which is declared to have been futile,
is the only notable incident reported
from the southern port.

Number Inside Not Known.
The number of men inside the sub*
marine at the time of the explosion
id not definitely -known. Albout 20
were working on the ciraft, 'but all
were not on the underwater boat 'at
the same time.
What caused the explosion has not
been definitely decided. 'Rear Ad*
miral .Nathaniel R. Uher, command­
ant of the navy yard, after an ex­
amination of the craft, and question­
ing workmen who had been nearby,
declined to express an opinion. He
said:
Were Working in Battery.
"The men were at work in the bat­
tery compartment of the E—8, dis­
charging the new 'Edison batteries
through a rheostat, to measure the
voltage, and the explosion occurred
in that compartment, while they were
working there. The battery will gen­
erate no kind of gas and there was
no gasoline on board. The engine
was of the oil burning Diesel type."
Temporary Investigating Committee*
Pending the appointment of an offi­
cial board of inquiry by the navy de­
partment, Rear Admiral Uher named
a temporary investigating committee.
The opinion was expressed that the
process of withdrawing the charge
from the battery might have caused
the formation of hydrogen gas. The
explosions of that nature have been in
frequent on submarines of all navies,.
it was explained, and several have ,:i
ocurred on American boats within a
the last few years. iNone of the oth- a
ers was serious, however. .'iss
Only One of Its Type.

the world equipped with the Edison:
nickel battery and she made her. Hot

cember 7, last. It was reported thftt
the new battery gave better speed
with less fuel.
Generated Gases.
The Edison battery, experiments
have proved, generates nearly dou­
ble the ordinary amount of hydrogen
during the process of charging, but
on discharge, or while lying idle,
gives off much less. During the 'bat
tery trials, there were reports from
her officers of an undue amount of
hydrogen. The boat made one trip
with observers aboard and it was re­
ported that while in operation not
enough gas was generated to be dan*
gerous.
There were three other submarines
in the drydock, but they were SO feet
from the F-2, which had been under*
going repairs since December SO.
There were no torpedoes, or gasoline
in any of them.

Although the detonation was terri­
fic, the submarine itself, from the
outside, shows none of the effects of
the explosion, the second fatal acci­
dent of its kind in the history of the
United States navy. The interior ap­
paratus was badly shattered, but so
tight was the vessel's shell that there
was no means of escape for gas ac­
cumulated and it was more than an
hour after the blast 'before the work
of recovering the bodleB could be
completed. A ladder was blown up
through the conning tower and fell
150 feet. away.
Bodies Removed.
The injured men and one body
were recovered soon after the acci­
dent, but three bodies far down ill
the craft could not be reached before
the gas had been blown out toy com­
pressed air. iSoon after the explosiop
several naval officers led a rescue
party into the drydock, but were over­
come by fumes when they attempted
to descend in to the vessel.
