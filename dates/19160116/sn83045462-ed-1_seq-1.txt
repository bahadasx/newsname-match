I .ON DOW January 15.?Only
on tlie Be*sarabian and cast Oalician
front in Montenegro have
there been recent military de- :
velopments of prime importance. 1
The rapid sequence of events in
the Montenegrin campaign, in- <
volving the crumbling of the little
kingdom's resistance, presents |<
perhaps the more dramatic j
aspect. l>?t on a far larger scale '
and of greater interest for the
moment at least is the conflict
being waged between the Aus- '
trians and the Russians.
The Russian offensive, resumed
in force after a brief halt, apparently
is being pressed with more
determination than before.
Losses Reported Fearful.
Russian attacks on the Austrians* positions
are Increasing In intensity, the
Russians repeatediv charging in masses,
but the assaults all along the 1
line have been repulsed, according to (
the official statement by the Austroli
unitarian war office, given out today >

The Huitsijiu Iomma are said to have s
been frightful, at one point 1,000 dead <
having been left before the position of j
an Austrian brigadePursuing
Montenegrins.
Tn Montenegro the Austrians, following
up their capture of Cettinje. are j
pursuing the depleted forces of King !
Kicholas, and have made additional j
captures.
The Austrian official statement de-j
scribing the continued operations in i
Montenegro says:
"In the Balkans the Austro-Hungarians.
in continuing their pursuit of
the enemy. have occupied Spizza.
"In Cettnje 154 cannon, iO.OOO rifles,
ten machine guns and uuantities of
ammunition were captured. The number
of cannon taken on Mount Lovcen
has reached fort>-flve. Three hundred
Montenegrins have been taken prisoner.
"Austro-Hungarian troops have
stormed trenches on the heights of
trading, south of Berane."
Tire Montenegrins, according to unoTicial
advice?, after transferring their
capital to Niksic, determined to make
a stand at Bieka. to the southeast of
Cettinje, and, if necessary, to continue
then retreat southward and concentrate
their defense at Scutari, Albania.
In interior Montenegro the Austrians
1 *\e advanced from Berane and taken
? ?. heights of tiradina to the south.
Peace Will Be Spurned.
The Montenegrin authorities officially
den . that Montenegro ever adhered to
or intends to adhere to any separate
proposal of peace, or to any armistice
wiiii Austria, it ih declared that King
Nicholas and his %.rmv and people will
continue to fight until the last man.

Hull Withstands Explosion.
Although the detonation was terrifUv
e submarine itself, from the outsids,
ows none of the effects of the explosion,
e second fatal accident of its kind in
e history of the United States Navy,
ne interior apparatus was badly ehatred,
but so tight was the vessel's shell
lat there was no means of escape for
ib wfeich acchffeuWtWV and ft was more
tan an hour after the blast before the
ork of recovering the bodies could be
m pie ted. A ladder was blown up
rough the conning tower and fell loO
et away.
The injured men and one body were
amoved soon after the accident, but
tree bodies far down in the craft
>uld not be reached until the gas
id been blown out by compressed air.
>on after the explosion several naval
ficers led a rescue party into the dry
>ck, but were overcome by gas fumes
hen they attempted to descend into
le vessel. Jt was then that com*
-eased air pipes were run into the
toll and the gas forced out.
Some of Crew Were Absent
The number of men inside the subaiine
at the time of the explosion is
>t definitely known. About twenty
ere working 011 the craft, but all of
lem were not on the underwater boat
the same time. It is not thought
issibie that any one wiio was inside
mid have escaped injury.
What caused the explosion has not
en definitely decided. Hear Admiral
athaniel K. Tsher, commandant o.
e navy yard, after an examination of
le craft and questioning: workmen
ho had been nearby, declined to ex ess
an opinion. He said:
"The men were at work in the hairy
compartment of the K-2. dischaigg
the new Edison batteries through
rheostat to measure the voltage, and
e explosion occurred in trim romi.rtment
while they were working
etc. The battery will generate no
nd of gas ami there was no gasoline
i board. The engine was of i he oiiirning
Diesel type."
I'ending the appointment of an oftial
board of inquiry by tiie Navy beirtment.
Rear Admiral I'slier named
temporary investigating committee,
follows:
Lieut. Commander Pope. Washington,
mmander of the receiving siiip
aine; Lieut. L. M. Stewart of the
rpedo boat destroyer McCall and
eut. Rush H. Fay, commander of the
bmarine division to which tie E-li
as attached. This committee irnmediely
began to take the testimony of
en working around the K-2 when
e explosion occurred.
Probable Cause of Explosion.

ooess of withdrawing: the charge
om the batteries might have caused
e formation of hydrogen gas. Hie
plosions of that nature have been
equent on submarines of all navies,
was explained, and several have ocrred
on American boats within the
5t few years. None of the others was
rioug. however.
The E-2 was the only vessel in the
>rld equipped with the Edison nickel
tteries. and she made her first trip
ccessfully with them December 7
5t. It was reported that the new batries
gave better speed with less fuel.
The Edison battery, experiments
\e proven, generates nearly double
e ordinary amount of hydrogen durg
the process of charging, but on
icharge or while lying idle gives off
ich less. During the battery trials
ere were reports from her officers
an undue amount of hydrogen. The
at made one trip with observers
oard. and it was reported that while
operation not enough gas was genited
to be dangerous,
rhere were three other submarines in
? dry dock, but they were about fifty
?t from the E-l!. which had been
dergoing repairs since December
There were no torpedoes or gasoie
aboard any of them.
Reports to the Secretary.
