This Most Likely Theory.

JTHW TORJC Jan. 18. The Investi
gation .Into the explosion on the auh
marlno B-3. which killed four men
unfl Injure- eleven In the Brooklyn
navy yard yesterday, will proceed to
morrow Under the direction of Lieut
Pope Washington.
The Injured men. who were taken to
the Cumberland Street Hospital, were
reported resting easily this afternoon.
All will recover.
Meanwhile, beyond the report of the
submarine's commander. Lieut.
Charlea M. Cooke, there Is little
ground to work on. Ho reported that
both batteries of the E-2 had been
affected by the explosion.
.Admiral Usher, the navy yard com
mandant, reltorated today his asser
tion lhat the disaster was caused by
Bus or some similar agency. The
Idea that the boat was wrecked by
an enemy was ridiculed.
, Hydrogen aGs Suspected.
Until "an official report Is made, all
theorjeti of the cause of the explo
nion .must be based on conjecture.
Expert navy men believe that hydro
gen gas generated by tho .batteries
and mingling- with tho alt; may have
raided the trouble.

"There w-s a gathering of escaping

CZAR MAY HELP MAINTAIN IT
Big and Complicated Change in
This Country's Relationship
to War Foresha'dswcd.
By JUDSON C. WELLIVER.
A big and complicated change In thla
country's relationship to the Muropenn
war is foreshadowed by tho reports
that Oreat Hrltain hpd Franco will
shortly declare n general blockade of
the entire seaconst of Germany.
It Is not announced whether Ttussla
will Join, but It Is expected oho will.
Inasmuch as her naval power and
bases In tlio Baltic will contribute
largely to enforcing a blockade.
Thus far tho allies havo not do
ctored a blockade of Germany; they
have proceeded under "orders In
council" which designate lists of con
traband whoso shipment to Germany
was forbidden and which were liable
to seizure when so destined.
A Wide Difference.
There Is a wide difference between
such regulations ns these, and the
proclamation of a blockade. Tho or
ders in council merely aim to keep,
out of Germany those things which
havo boen declared contraband. There
are two kinds of contraband: absolute,
which comprises nrtlcles primarily
adapted antf used tor war purpose--and
conditional, which means articles
that may be used In wrar though not
nec08narlly so. Merchandise other
than these' classes, Is not to be de
clared contraband. " Presumably, then,
It may he sent to tho belligerent
without Interference.
But there 'le a limit to' this. Article
qh tho contraband lest may and will be
elsed when found, whether thero Js a.
blockade oc rtot. Tho6 which are not
onthfe'-contraband list rnay be shut cut
by declaring a rjWokadi-4W;hVa. WHr,
hlbltlon bflljcpmmer0 --:)thTtholnemy

TJierollff KttMo 'difference. Interna
tional ciu-t'om rofiulrea. that a blockade
moat be 'effective: a. vessel runnlnt
through l must We" sublccted to real
risk of capture. Contraband may bo
captured whether' there Is a blockade
or not: but noncontraband na well as
contraband may be captured If there Is
a blockade.
Blockade Really In Effect. '
Suppose Austria and tho United Stages
were at war. Austria could not mtdfo
a blockade of the United Slates effec
tive ; therefore sho would not doelare
a blockade. But she would Issue a con
traband list, and thereafter would bo
privileged to seize contraband destined
to the United States. The United States,
on the other hand, by reason orsuoerlor
naval power and tho shortness of the
Austrian seacoast. might actually block
ado Austria, and make it effective: ho
the United States would gain the right
to selzo anything whatever destined to
Austria.
In tlio present war. the allies found
their difficulty, first. In making a
blockade of Germany physically effec

There are times when murder will not "out."
On" these occasions the relentless tentacles of the law are far-
flung upon the discovery of the crime, in the hope of enmeshing some
I hapless man or woman who wears an invisible brand of Cain. Rut
when clues and evidence fail, when all of the skill of men trained in
the hunting of man has been traversed to its barren end, then the
hand of the law, stayed by the wall of impenetrable mystery, goes

He comes from the obscurity of an every-day casual existence,
where no police record stood against him later to set Nemesis on his
track. He is impelled b)r an impulse known only to himself and to his

unseen, to the home of Jiim whose life he seeks. The deed of dark

might later rise to fasten the black

State. Department officials were ad

These documents contained evidence
that von Papen had paid sums of money
to Paul Koenlg. the Hamburg-American
official now under Indictment at New

of the Wetland canal, and to Hans
Adam von Wedlll. who was Indicted at

letters to the Department of Justice, 'If,
after they are received from Ambassa

of Incriminating nature in them.
Importance Minimized.
Officials minimized the Importance of
records taken from von Papen showing
payments of money by the German em
bassy to von Papen. and subsequent
payments by von Papen to Horn, the
bridge dynamiter, the Seattle consul,
Koenlg, and others- These money trans

would not be sufficient to establish
