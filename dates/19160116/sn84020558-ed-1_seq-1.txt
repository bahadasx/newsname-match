A:so lation ttnuf ntion raised a fund
of more than ?S.0O in cash on the
floor of the convention in twenty
minuts today to maintain a lobby in
Washington against the f-pi acre
homestead bill, now under demote in
ongress. Subscriptions to the fund
were still being made after ih con
vection adjourned this evening.
The action followed an address by
Dwight 15. Heard of phoenix. Ariz.,
president of the American National
Livestock Association, who spoke to
invite the wool men to have repre
sentatives at the meeting of his or
ganization at Kl 1'aso, Texas, January
-.1. lie said the pending hill was ob
jectionable because it did not pro
vide for classification of public lands
as between agricultural and grazing
areas and made it possible for "land
hops" to file on 040 acres of grazing
Isnd and tharge livestock growers ex
liorbitant prices for it, and that the
bill made no provision lor preserving
ami developing watering places for
livestock. A resolution to se:id a del
egation to tne Kl Paso convention was
passeii unanimously. F. J. Hagcnbarth
of Halt Lake, president of the Woo!
HiTwers' Association, took the floor
. Immediately.
' Passing resolutions is not all thei
is to this matter,-' he said. "You
must remember thai you intend soon
to start a fight in a prejudiced eon'
gress against the powerful influence
of the homesteader. It will he a Ions
anil hard struggle, that will take
brains, work and money. Are you
willing to pay what it costs? for if
you do not, the officers of the asso
ciation will refuse to carry out your
resolutions. 1, for one, will not tie a
in 1 1 to send a mere "hot air" ex
clusion, hot equipped for solid work,
nnd thus make ourselves ridiculous."
A motion to raise the money at
once was made anil carried unani
mously, and cash contributions were
received by Dr. J. M. Wilson of Wy
oming, temporary chairman.
Former Governor Frank II. Good
ing of Idaho was named as ehair-
man of the lobby committee this I
evening and other members will be
named later.
The convenTion adopted unanimous
ly a resolution asking that the remain
ing public domain be classified as be
tween agricultural and grazmg landt
and that grazing lands be v;ithdrawn
from entry and leased to livestock
producers.
other resolutions asking that im

Nevv York, Jan. 15. Four men were
killed and ten others injured, five of
them dangerously, in an explosion
which occurred this afternoon on the
submarine E-2 while the craft was un
dergoing' repairs in dry dock tit the
New York navy yard. One of the men
killed was an enlisted, electrician and
the other three civilian workers. At !
least three of the ten now in hospitals
are not expected to live.

Although the explosion was terrific,
the submarine itself from the outside
allows none j( the effects of the explo
sion which was the second fatal ac
cident of its kind in the history of the
t'niied States navy. The interior ap
paratus was shattered, but so tight was
the vessels shell that there was no
means of escape for gas which accu
mulated and it was more than nn hour
after the blast before the work of re
covering the hodies -was completed.
A ladder was blown through the con
ning tower and fell t.'fl feet away. The

not ueunitely known. A hot it twenty

at the same time. It is not thought

What caused the explosion has not
been decided. Rear Admiral Nathaniel

yard, after an examination of the
craft and after questioning workmen
who had been nearby, declined to ex
press an opinion. He said:
"The men were at work in the natter'.-
compartment of the R-2. dis
charging the new Edison batteries
through, a rheostat to measure the
voltage and the explosion occurred in
that compartment. The battery will
gemrate no kind of gas and there was
no gasoline on board. The engine was
of the oil-burning Diesel type."

WASHINGTON, Jan. l.V What
caused the explosion on the Submarine
E-2 at the New York Navy Yard, with
a loss of life and serious damage to
the vessel, probably w ill not be known
definitely until the special board of
naval officers appointed tonight to in
vestigate has completed its inquiry.
From first reports, saying that the new
Kdison storage batteries in the K-2
were being re-charged at the time of
the accident, it was concluded by navy
department officials that dydrogen gas
had ignited, but later official informa
tion that the batteries were being dis
charged upset the theory. A compara
tive small quantity of hydrogen gas is
generated by a storage battery in pro
cess of discharge.
The following statement issued to
night by the navy department con
tained all that was known here offi
cially: "An explosion occurred on the K-2
in dry dock this afternoon at 1:15 p.
m., apparently under the battery deck,
which Hire up the battery floor under
the forward hatch. The Edison stor-
ae
battery was being discharged
at the time at a
slow- rate.
"So far only a brief erbal report
has been made by Lieutenant Charles
Cooke, commander of the E-2. A
board of investigation, in accordance
with navy regulations, has been ap-
jn ll( ij,,,It'(,
commandant, consist'
itng of lieut- ( ommnmli-r Cope Wash-
I ington, senior member
Lieut. L. M.
Stewart r. s. McCall. Lieut. . j. g
Rush s. fav recorder. -
"The b.;arl will meet immediately '
investigate and report."
' The department's experts on Sub
marine construction said they knew
only of two possible causes of the ex
plosion, aside from the possible igni
tion of hydrogen gas. While highly
improbable, they said, it was possible
that llicre had been an explosion of
the oil used to drive the surface en
gines. Thcr? never has been an a;ci
dmi of that characK r, even with boats
operated by gasoline, a far more explo
sive liquid than the heavy oil used to
run the K-2 s engines.
The second possibility, theA said,
was that an air flask had exploded.
Flasks which furnished the motive
power of a torpedo carry a pressure
of 2UH pounds to the square inch, while
the flasks iMed to store air for the
boat while submerged carry much less
pressure. The fact that the victims of
the explosion were badly burned ap
peared to dismiss that possibility. It
also was pointed out tha'. the explo
sion ot an air, llask probably would

THE HAGUE, (Via London) Jan. 15. 1
Tile American members of the Ford
peace .mission, except those associated
with die permanent peace, board, sailed
front Rotterdam today aboard the
steamer Rotterdam for New York. A
great crowd assembled on the wharves
and cheered as the steamer departed.
Among those bidding farewell to the
visitors were citizens of Norway and
Denmark, through which countries the
Americans had traveled on their pcacv
mission during the past six weeks.
About one hundred and fifty persons
sailed, while, thirty remained at The
Hague -to promote the peace plans as
originally devised. The members of
the permanent board will hold daily
sessions.
Germany's blocking of the recent at
tempts of the Scandinavians to return
to their homes through Germany is
regarded as making certain the selec
tion of Stockholm for future sittings
of the peace hoard. That would ob
viate iiie neecssiij ot crossing the war
zone.
Dr. Aked said that Stockholm likely
would be selected, hut the matter will
be referred to Mr. Ford.

to the interior of Chihuahua state on
the train which left Juarez late to

General Jacinto Ttevino, the Carran-
za commander was quoted last night
in dispatches from Chihuahua city
to theN effect that only 30t Villa men
remained uncaptured. Mexican of
ficials at Juarez estimate, however,
that there are at least l.SOU men on
the war path in western Chihuahua.
Funeral services ' over the body of
two of the three remaining victims
of Monday's tragedy will be held to
morrow. C. D. Watson, manager of the Cusi

Reports that riots had occurred at j
Kort HaneocK today, in wtiicn t un
ed States soldiers had attacked Mex

telegraphic messages declared there
were no riots of importance and that
the reports originated from the fact
that one or two soldiers haw been

countermanding ptjeviotts instructions
to proceed and ordering him to re

Mr. Letcher said tonight there was
no significance in the message( from

be no legal question of the right of

All doubts as to the application of

many or Knginnd would have a navy
far superior to our own, .and, eoase

"Our enemy would be able to land
upon our shores at least a quarter of u

at the rate of 250,000 a month, if they
