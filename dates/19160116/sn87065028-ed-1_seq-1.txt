Urict Erection of $15,000
Home on Campus of Indus
trial Institute and College.
In hi regular financial report
to the legislature the coming week.
lion. II. L. Whitfield, president or
the Industrial Institute and College,
will stress' the fact that no provision
ha ever been made for taking care
of the teachers of this state institu
tion, and' will urge an appropriation
for the erection of a teachers' home
on the campus.
"Why homes should be provided
for the teachers of colleges of boy?
and not for the teachers of the
girls, no one has ever explained,"
says Mr. Whitfield, "and there are
many reasons why it is not only
even handed justice but also means
for the higher efficiency of the
work that the teachers should be
properly cared for." He also say3:
"The I. I. and C. demands just a?
much training for its teachers as the
colleges for boys demand for their
teachers. It is no argument to say
that the women should not receive
for teaching the same compensation
as men. The great universities of
the country where teachers are
trained, make no distinction as to
cost based on sex. It costs a woman
Just as much to spend a year at Co-
lumbia University as it does a mnn
There are just as many demand
made on the teachers of the I. I. &
C. rts there are on the teachers of
anv college; they are supposed to
contribute to all college activities;
t help w'ipport the hurch to which
they belong; to contribute to char
itabe objects just as men do. It may
not be said that women teachers
have no" families to support; from a
long experience in education in Mis
sissippi, I, as president of the I. I. &
C would not fear contradiction
when I say that there are more
women teachers supporting families
in Mississippi than are men teacher?
doing the same thing. As it now is
a limited number of the teaehert
are given rooms in the dormitories
for the protection of the-girls, a
large number of them have to get
living places In the city. With a
teachers' home there would be an
opportunity for the teachers to do
much for the social life of the girls."
No land would have to be pur
chased for the purpose of building
a teachers' home. Though the cam
pus is crowded, there is one lot that
would make an excellent location
for a building of this kind. It if
stated that $15,000 would make a
building sufficiently large to ac
comodate the teachers.
DIES AT HOIE 'll TEXAS
DEATH
ED
WAS NOT UNEXPECT
AS HE STEADILY
GREW WORSE.
El Paso, Tex., January 13. Vic
toriano Huerta, former dictotor of
Mexico, died at his home here today
at 8:35 o'clock.
General Huerta, who succeeded
Gen. Francisco I. Madero in execa
tive power in Mexico City and later
left Mexico, died of scelerosis of the
liver. He was surrounded by hw
family when the end came. His con
dition had steadily grew worse for
the past few days and his death was
not unexpected.
Gen. Victoriana Huerta "was
professional soldier, and as such he
had, up to the overthrow of Madero
been known for his loyal support of
the existing governments. He
fought loyally for President Porfo
rio Diaz until his fall, and when Diaz
was no longer chief executive
fought for Francisco de la Barra
the provisional president. After Ma
dero was elected Huerta found it to
be his duty to support one who had
nrx trim murVi- ft a n maKa! TTia Isttfnl
bu iuiik iuuKUt. an c i vMvii ilia jujar
ty was not challenged until the Felix
Diaz revolution in Mexico City in
February 1913, when the Madero
government , was completely over -
thrown, and Huerta himself elevated
to the presidency.

amends this law so as to make the es

and, as it has already been favor
ably reported by the senate judiciary

High School Bonds.
Vote for the high school bonds be- j
cause that's the proper way to bu:! Ji
all necessary public buildings.
After the building is erected and;
equipped the city will owe .-",
more bonded indebtedness, but it
will have $50,000 more property to

fund to take care of the bonds, each

debtedness and we will have the use
of the building to give our boys and
girls the kind of education they
nn.hf to kv t hU tKoie !n
ougnt to nave to hold their own in
the future.
Bond issues are a wise, legal plan
of using the credit of the city in such
a way that all tax payers can co-operate
with each other'and buy with
their money what they want to buy
with it. Bond issues permit progress
in city and county development be
cause your part of the money sq
spent could not buy a school build
ing by itself alone, however badly
you might want it, but when added
to everybody else's part, the total
enables us to provide such public
improvements as we want to make.
Vote for the high school bonds.

I Jr. Charles W. Westmoreland, a
