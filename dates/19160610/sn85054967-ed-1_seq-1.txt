THE PA TRIOT
New York Militiamen Show How Quickly They Can Mobilize
~
In order to show New Yorkers and others how quickly the national guardsmen could be assembled in case of
necessity, nearly 10,000 of the citizen soldiers mobilized in record time at the Sheepshead Bay speedway to take
part in the battle problem which they were to work out in the presence of Major General John F. O'Ryan and some
B,ooospectators at the military and naval tournament. Bit the exercises were interrupted when it was announced
that, owing- to complaint of the Kings County Observance league against the breaking of certain "blue laws," there
could be no noise in the mimic war. Blank cartridges forrifle and cannon were taboo, drums, bugles and bands were
forbidden, and no aeroplane was allowed to fly, with its noisy exhaust. And, acting under orders from General
O-Ryan, the guard obeyed the law so carefully that the only noise the watchers heard during the whole "fight"
was the crack, crack, crack of the rifles and the zig of bullets in a shooting gallery near by that ran merrily through
it all. The pictures show: No. 1, practice with field guns; No. 2, anti-air craft gun on exhibition; No. 3, Colonel
Conelius Vanderbilt, millionaire and national guard officer and enthusiast; No. 4, auto towing two field guns.
