According to an opinion hand
ed down by Wiley E. Jones, at
torney general, those who have
registered for the fall primaries
''no party" must let that classi
fication stand. Since the regis
tration opened there has been
considerable question as to the
right of a prospective voter to
declare his politics one way and
then to change that declaration.
The bill of Senator Ashurst of
Arizona, appropriating $10,000
lor the construction of a bridge
on International avenue in No

to the senate. He also secured
the release of 600 head of cattle
belonging to Messrs. McCall &
Herron, of Douglas. These cat

Owing to the almost impass
able condition of the county road
between Parker and the Empire
mine, ore is now being shipped
down the river by boat. About
17 tons are daily being handled
in this manner. As soon as a
permanent road is put in along
the river route the Empire will
begin the shipment of at least
one carload per day, increasing
gradually with the development
of the property. Parker Post.
The three cent passenger fare
on the lines of the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific, and rates of
three and one half and four cents
a mile on the Arizona Eastern
are prescribed in an order of the
Arizona corporation commission.
Three cents a mile is also pre
scribed on the line of the Ray
and Gila Valley Railroad. Ex
isting passenger rates on other
railroads operating in Arizona
are not disturbed by the order,
which becomes effective Aug. 1.
Tucsonians have been inter
ested of late in Arkansas and
Arizona stock. This property
lies about one mile in a north
westerly direction from Jerome,
Arizona. Considerable money
was spent in sinking a shaft 1800
feet deep, and in surface im
provements. It is understood
that an agreement has just re
cently been entered into with
the Goodrich Lochhart Company
by which the latter company is
to commence work on the prop
erty. This has had a tendency
to boost the price of the stock.
The Greene-Cananea Copper
Company has just issued its re

during the year, including ores
purchased, 1(3,335,081 pounds of
refined copper; 035,997. 35 ounces
of silver; 3, 773. 57 ounces of gold.
Average price received for cop
per produced in the year was
19.500 cents per oound. Total
cost per pound of refined copper,
after deducting value of precious
metals and miscellaneous re
venue, was 11.08(5 cents per

The farmer who allows his
fowls to drink impure water is
inviting disease into his flock.
It costs but little to have earthen
or iron drinking vessels, and in
these the water can be kept
clean and pure. Plenty of pure
water should be at the disposal
of the chickens at all times. It
is pot enough to say there is
plenty of water for them out-of
doors, in the horse trough or
hog trough, and other places.
Probably the water in these
other places is foul or full
of deseaso germs; but if the hens
have no other they are forced to
drinl it. Don't let them do it.
FOR BETTtR ROADS.
On May 11th, in the House of
Representatives, Congressman
Carl Hay den, introduced the
following bill, granting public
lands to the State of Arizona for
the construction, repair, and
maintenance of public roads and
highways:
Be it enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in
Congress assembled. That there
is hereby granted and conveyed
to the State of Arizona one mil
lion acres of unreserved, non
mineral, surveyed public lands
lying within said State, the pro
ceeds of the sales of which shall
be used solely for the purpose
of constructing, repairing, and
mainting public roads and high
ways. Sec. 2. That said lands shall
be selected under the authority
and direction of the State land
department of said State within
three years after the passage and
approval of this Act, and Sec
retary of the Interior is hereby
authorized and directed to issue
patents to the State of Arizona
as soon as the section or design
ation thereof has been certified
to him by the governor of said
State, the designation to be
made by legal subdivision of the
public land surveys.
Sec. 3. That the lands herein
granted shall be sold after issu
ance of patent, by the proper
authorities of said State, at not
less than $3 per acre and not in
greater area than six sections or
three thousand eight hundred
and forty acres to any one in
dividual, association, or corpor
ation, and under such rules and
regulations for the disposition
thereof as may be provided by
the legislature of the State of
Arizona.
State May Get Chunk of Canyon.
Attorney General Wiley E.
Jones made the important an
nouncement last night, that at
the opportune time, accompanied
by State Land Commissioner
Moeur and State Engineer Lamar
Cobb, he would go to Washing
ton and there take up with the
Secretary of Agriculture and the
president, the question of setting
aside a townsite for the State of
Arizona on the rim of the Grand
Canyon. Jones and Moenrliave
been working on this plan lor
some time. Thinking that the
Santa Fe would attempt to block
any move that they might make
to this end, they have -kept the
matter a profound secret. The
railroad became acquainted with
the plan and had a bill introduc
ed into congress putting the can
yon under a park commission.
This would have blocked the plan
of Jones to give Arizona its share
of the park. Through strenuous
efforts on the part of the Arizona
officials, the bill was side tracked
in Congress. When in Washing
ton on a visit some months ago,
the attorney general interviewed
Secretary Houston on the subject
and secured his promise of co op
eration. Jones outlined his plan
of setting aside a township there,
building a state highway up to
it, and secured the hearty en
dorsement of the secretary. Re

Lubrication Important Factor in Keep
ing Motor Cool.
"The question of lubricating
oil is directly connected with
that of cooling" says Mechanical
Bulletin No. 3 entitled "Engine
Overheating," gotten out recent
ly by the Standard Oil Co."
"Lubricating oil dissipates the
heat of friction generated by the
pistons in the cylinders. If the
lubricating oil does not perform
its duty correctly, the heat of
friction is added to that of the
fuel, and the cooling medium
will not be sufficient to keep the
temperature of the motor at the
point of efficiency.
"If the body of the oil in the
system is depleted through long
use and impregnated with part
icles of metal, carbon and dirt,
it will produce a high coefficient
of friction, and overheating will
result. Hence the importance
of systematic draining of the
crank case and oil reservoir.
'If an oil of incorrect body is
used it will cause overheating
Incorrect body means that when
the oil comes in contact with the
hot cylinder walls, its body will
partially or whollv break down
and allow the metals to come in
contact, resulting in an excess
ively high coefficient of friction
and possible abrasion. Incorrect
body also means that if too heavy
an oil is used, it will not reach
the wearing surface fast enough,
and excessive friction will result,
which will overheat the motor in
addition to causing undue wear."
Many motor authorities de
clare, and the experience of the
majority of Pacific Coast motor
ists bears it out, that oil made
from western asphalt base crude
keeps its lubricating qualities
longer at cylinder heat, and
therefore gives better results."
Oil Flotation Mill for Three R Mine.
Survayors are at work this
week at the Three R mine, to
determine the location of the
new 100 ton daily capacity oil
flotation mill which is to be put
up at that property. Ground is
expected to be broken and work
started on the mill within a few
days. It is believed the mill
will be put up right at the mine,
but the question of water may
enter largely into the selection
of a site. The first unit is to be
of 100 tons capacity and other
units may be added as needed.
The oil flotation process will
treat only the low grade ores,
shipment beiBg made direct to
the. smelter of the high grade,
of which thirty tons are now be
ing shipped daily to the El Paso
smelter.
The completion of the mill will
enable the new owners of the
Three R to develop the famous
mine on a scale greater than
hitherto attempted, as to this
date none of the low grade ore
has been treated. It will mean
much to Santa Cruz county and
Patagonia in particular, for the
greater the activity and increas
ed payroll at the Three R the
greater the prosperity of this
district.
The Three R mine was recent
ly taken over by H. C. Harrison
and son, on a 8500,000 deal.

R. R. RICHARDSON WINS.
News that the famous Rich-aidson-Heney
litigation regard
ing the. Three R mine, near Pa
tagonia, had been won by Rich
ardson on appeal to the supreme
court of Arizona, was received
yesterday by Attorneys Curley
and Hereford, representing R. R.
Richardson, says the Tucson
Star.
The decision in the case when
tried in the superior court of Co
chise county was that Francis
and Ben Heney were entitled to
a one-third interest in the mine
and 835,000 additional. Rich
ardson appealed and yesterday
the decision of the supreme
court, reversing the lower court,
was handed doivn.
Recently, when the mine was
sold by Richardson to the Harri
son interests, a third of the pur
chase price of 8500,000 was set
apart in the bank to cover the
Heney interests. This money
will now go to Richardson iu
view of the supremo court decision.
ONE CAUSE OF PROSPERITY.
"Even the South is now pros
perous, thanks to the Secretary
of the Treasury's wise and lib
eral administration of the Treas
ury Department," said Senator
Tillman in the Senate the other
day.
What is back of that .state
ments Just this the fact that
the Secretary of the Treasury
has placed the excess of Gov
ernment funds where the actual
business need has been greatest
and has disregarded the Repub
lican plan of depositing the Gov
ernment millions where the spe
culative demand was strongest.
The Government's millions went
to aid the South in the fall of
1914 and thewinterof 1915 when
the war shut oil' a great part of
the South's cotton market. Be
cause this money did not go into
Wall street banks to be turned
over at exorbitant interest rates
to speculative uses. The South
is now prosperous.
And what does this mean in
the North? It is one of the
causes of the even, general and
unprecedented distribution of
prosperity in the North. The
South is now able to buy liberal
ly in the North and is doing so.
That is a tremendous stimulus
to northern commerce. It is but
one of the debts literally, debts
which the people of the U. S.
owe to the Wilson administration.
Fare Three Cents Per Mile.
In compliance with an order
issued last week by the corpora
tion commission, the largest
railroads in the state will on
August 1, 19i6, reduce their
passenger rates, in all but one
case to three cents per mile.
The one road exempted is the
Arizona Eastern and they will
be allowed to charge three and
one-half cents per mile on the
Phoenix division, and- on the
Globe-Cochise division, a rate of
four cents per mile per passen
ger will be allowed. The former
rates on these divisions were
three and one-half cents per
mile, and four cents per mile.
The three roads which will be
forced to reduce their rates, so
drastically are the Southern Pa
cific, the Ray and Gila Valley
and the Santa Fe.
The railroads which are ex
empted from the three cent, are
The El Paso and Southwestern,
Canyon Railroad Company, Mo-
renci, Southern Railway Com
pany, The United Verde and Pa
cific Railroad Company, The
Arizona and New Mexico Rail
way Company, Shannon, Ariz
ona Railway Company, Arizona
and Swansea Railroad Company,
Magma Arizona Railroad Com
pany, Mascot and Western Rail
road Company and the Tucson
Cornelia and Gila Bend Railroad
Company.
Open Entries tor July 4-th Road Race.
Entry blanks for the annual
Douglas to Tucson road race,
under the auspices of the Tucson
and Douglas Motorcycle Clubs,
have been issued by M. L. Mor
an, treasurer of the Tucson club,
in whose hands the blanks and
entries must be left. The blanks
state that the race will have the
sanction of the F. A. M., and
will be run under the rules of
that organization.
Stock or non-stock machines
may be entered but must bo de
signated as such. The length
of the route, which is via Tomb
tone and Benson, is approxim
ately 140 miles. Awards will be
divided between the three win
ning machiues, but the .amount
of prize money has not yet been
announced. Entrance fee is 82
if paid before 0 p. m. July 1.
According to Attorney Gen
eral Wiley E. Jones, members of
the Arizona national guard now
stationed in this city will have
the right to vote at the election
this fall even though they are
still in camp iu Douglas. The
militiamen from all outside points
can vote for state and national
candidates, though not for can
didates in Cochise county. Mili
tiamen from this county can, of
course, vote for the entire ticket,
as this is their home. Dispatch.
