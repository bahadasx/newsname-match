ian border, a front of 2i»0 miles. The

Speaks of North Sea Battle.
The Earl of Selbourne, president of
the board of agriculture, speaking in
London last night on the recent battle
in the North Sea, between the British
and Germans, said:
"How (precipitate was the flight of
the German neet is shown by the fact
that only three men were "wouriued in
the whole of Admiral Jellicoe's fleet.'
Not one of his ships was able to get
in the gun fire more than six mfhutes.
The only one of his ships to suffer
was the battleship Marlborough.
.' which
was torpedoed by a submarine,
but reached Havre safely."
"No sensible maneuver expected
anything from the Germans, birt great
efficiency. In the firist two phases of
the action, the German sailors fought
well, and their strategy was right in
retiring at the beginning of the third
phase of the battle, when Admiral
Jellicoe's fleet arrived, for if they
wanted to preserve their fleet, it was
necessary to avoid deliberately chal­
lenging for the mastery of the sea
this time. But after that to proclaim
a great victory and a school holiday
and publish a speech like that of the
kaiser, was making the German navy
ridiculous-"
Steamer Dunrobbin Escaped.
The British stefimer Dunrobbin suc­
ceeded today in .passing through the
sound on the way to England. She
had been lying in the British port of
Lulea, a thousand miles north of the
sound since the beginning of the war,
and presumably started on. her jour­
ney' immediately after the battle in
the North Sea. The Dunrobbin was
chased "by armed German trawlers,
but the Swedish torpedo boat destroy­
er Castor, in command of Prince Wll
lia m.suddenly occurred and convoyeu
her safely through the narrow waters.
Newspapers here commenting on
the Dunrobbin escape say it is ap­
parent German destroyers are not pa

Lieut. R. F. Sufley Held World's
Record for Altitude for Hydro*
aeroplane Flights.
.Washington, June 9.—Lieutenant
Richard F. Jsufley, a navy aviator,
killed today at Pensacola, held a
•world's altitude record for hydroaero­
plane flights made last March when
he ascended to 16,072 feet.
Lieutenant Sufley was 32 years of
age, and a native of Kentucky- He
was appointed to the Naval academy
from that state in 1904, and has been
attached to the Pensacola station
since January, 1915. Preliminary re­
ports to the navy department indicat­
ed that the accident was caused by
the breaking of the tail of the hydro­
aeroplane during flights.
Lieutenant Sufley was using a ma­
chine in which he had made two
world's hydroaeroplane records. He
was 700 feet in tne air. The observor
at the United States Aeronautical sta­
tion saw the machine dive straight
downward and strike the island. Sub
ley was placed in charge of the de­
partment of instruction at the station
here a year ago. He was deemed an
exceedingly cautious pilot. Last Mon­
day he remained in the air eight
hours and thirty minutes. It was
said to be a world's record for craft
of this type.

states of Chihuahua and San Luis,

A battle is eminent between consti­

Sir William Robertson, chief of the

He started life as a pantry boy, lat­

He was commissioned from the
ranks and in spite of the caste system
which made such promotions almost
impossible in the British forces be­

Oyster Bay, N. Y„ .Tune 9.—Col.
Roosevelt announced tonight, that he
had exacted a pledge from the Pro­
gressives not to nominate until to­
morrow.
The Progressive national conven­
tion is becoming restless. Col. Roose­
velt admitted tonight. Telephone
calls for him have come almost hourly
and sometimes half hourly during the
day. He has been pressed for infor­
mation as to how much longer it
would be before there would be a
nomination.
Col. Roosevelt responded in effect
to each appeal by advising delay and
proposing that the Progressives wait
until some definite action was taken
by the Republicans. Col. Roosevelt
tonight still refused to indicate his at­
titude in regard to the nomination of
a separate ticket by Progressives.
It is the general opinion in Oyster
Bay tonight, however, that unless
"the Republicans show a spirit of ac­
commodation," the Progressives un­
doubtedly will place a third ticket in
the field.
Col. Roosevelt appeared to be deep­
ly interested tonight when informed
of the result of the first ballot in the
Republican convention. He declined,
however, to make any comments and
said he probably would have no state
merit to issue tonight.
Wire Rooting for Teddy.
Col. Roosevelt tonight made public
the following telegram he had receiv­
ed from Fran* M. Maclennan, editor
of the Topeka (Kan.1 State Journal,
who supported Wm. H. Taft in 1912:
"I am going to stay with you, if
even only one convention nominates
you. If the Progressive party only is
to nominate you, then that party will
virtually be the American party for
preparedness and protection to the
country's people, industries, 'honor
and respect, and will draw men and
women from all parties.
"The Topeka State Journal is an
independent paper but we Republi­
cans and all others can make our ef­
fective protest only through you as
a standard bearer and hereafter suffer1
ing the sorrow and humiliation from
the loss of our standing and com­
manding influence among the nations,
caused by President Wilson's weak
and wobbling words and policies and
actions,
Washington, June 9.—The balloting at Chicago did'
not interrupt the seclusion in which Justice Hughes is
spending convention week. He was in his office at his
residence throughout the day, busy with court work. He
had no callers. Before the convention began voting, he
retired to the drawing room of his residence, where he
spent the evening with Mrs. Hughes and their daughters.
Several newspaper representatives were received by his
private secretary, and the local newspapers telephoned
summaries of the ballots. His secretary took the results
to the Justice.
Chicago, June 9.—Keeping pace with fate and with the promise Im­
plied in the agreement reached by the Republican and Progressive harmony
conference, both conventons today did just what they were expected to do.
"Notwithstanding predictions and promises that one or the other would
get out of hand or do something surprising, nothing unexpected happened*
The Republicans met, listened to nominating speeches, took the two prom*
itsed ballots without nomination, and adjourned until 11 a. m. tomorrow.'
The Progressives met an hour before, and followed the program laid
down by the managers. They debated the platform, kept tab oh the, Colf«
seum, listened to tlje efforts of their best orators, and when word canHf
that the Republicans had adjourned without making a nomination, they
