TWO OF THE BEST IN A WEEK
Judge W. E. Smith, who was re
elected to the office of county judge
in the primaries last week, bought a
Maxwell car of the latest model yes
terday afternoon from R. R. Carroll,
the Maxwell distributor for this tes
ritory. . , , -
It is said that the third time is the
charm. Nearly a year ago, Judge
Smith attempted to buy a Maxwell
from Mr. Carroll. . Deliveries were
backward at that time and he could
not wait. Later on he made another
r.ttempt to buy a car, but was most
too quick for the Maxwell man and
bought a car of another make be
fore his offer was accepted. Both of
the previous purchases having been
disposed of, Judge Smith is now driv
ing a "Maxwell and has joined the
ranks of the many satisfied owners of
this car which is beating the world on
its low upkeep expense based on the
miles- traveled.
Judge Smith and family went to
Orlando in their new car this after
noon, where they will spend Sunday
with friends. '.- ,

se it on its former presentation should
be sure to see it Tuesday.

WORK MAY BEGIN NEXT WEEK
Mayor Robertson Will Sign Contract
for the Converse Mill Site
Work on the new light and water
plant has been delayed by the city
not having completed the purchase of
the Converse mill property. The city
was without funds necessary to buy
the property, and under the charter
was not in a position to borrow. In
order not to delay work on the plant
further, it was arranged for Mr.
T. P. Drake of Yalaha, to advance
$3,100 for the deferred payments on
the property, the city having had
available the $1,000 cash payment
asked f orjby Mr. David S. Welch. Mr.
Drake purchases the property to the
extent of the amount he advances,
and gives the city a contract to sell,
and in this way the city is able to
make the trade without violating its
charter.
The mayor was out of the city yes
terday and today, and will probably
sign the contract on his return. He is
reported to have said that he would
sign it. President Nash said this
morning that as soon as the contract
was signed some of the city's work
men could be put to work to assist in
razing the Converse mill and clearing
the ground for starting the new plant.
Mayor Robertson returned to the
city this afternoon, and said that he
would sign the contract at once. He
had delayed affixing his signature, he
said, until he could get a written
opinion from City Attorney Hocker
as to whether or not the city's char
ter was being violated. The charter
provides against borrowing over $5,
000. The city attorney has given a
written opinion in the matter, and the
mayor says that biaritlpin this opin
ion to the contract and sign.

EVERYTHING IS
LOOKING IIP
Crops are in Splendid Condition in
Nearly All Parts of Marion
;r5."'. County 7,
, From every section of Marion coun
ty reports of good crops continue to
come. Staples predominate, and corn
is king among these. Around Lowell
there is a good stand of corn, accord
ing to Robert and M. Neil, who were
in the city today. Cantaloupes began
moving in that section Monday, and
have been moving steadily since.'
Watermelons will begin to move about
Monday week. Messrs. Neil say that
they did not do so well with their
string beans on account of the drouth
of several weeks ago. These men are
farming on Sugar Hammock lands.
In the Blitchton and Berlin section
the crops are coming on fine, and the
recent rains have given things new
vitality. The rains have benefited the
whole county, in fact. W. B. Rawls
and D. Shealy, of Berlin, in town to
day, report conditions excellent in
their section. Across the Oklawaha
river, according to T. B. Griggs,, of
Lynne, .and E. L. Guinn of Conner,
the tendency is toward general im
provement. The big need in this
section, these men say, is better trans
portation facilities. A tram road has
been laid recently, but is not perma
nent. A permanent railroad through
this southeastern part of the county
would bring about considerable de
velopment. TUESDAY AUCTION CLUB
The club will meet Tuesday after
noon at four o'clock with Mrs. Her
bert Lattner.
