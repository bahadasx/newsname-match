AT HIGH SCHOOL LAST EVENING
Knowledge of Spiritual Truth Delivers
from Every Evil Condition Claim
Virgil 0. Strickler.
Virgil O. Strickler, a member of the
board of lectureship of the Mother
church 'in Boston, delivered an inter
esting address on Christian Science In
high school hall Friday evening to an
audience comfortably filling the audi
torium. The speaker knew his subject. and
his manner of delivery was smooth and
cultured, lie came to Bennington un
der the auspices of the local church
of Christ Scientists. For an hour and
a half he talked In easy, interesting
manner on the theories on which Chris
tlan Science is based.
The main portion of his address fol
lows: As it becomes more generally under
stood that through the ministry of
Christian Science people are being
healed of sickness, sin, unhappiness,
worry, fear, and other discordant con
ditions, there is an ever-increasing de
sire upon the part of the general pub
lic to learn how these results are ac
complished. It was the purpose of this
lecture to explain how Christian
Science does these things. There is no
mystery about Christian Science heal
ing, nor is it difficult to understand. It
can be stated without any reserva
tion whatever that every person who
is willing to do so may learn how to
heal sickness and to destroy the desire
to sin for himself and others through
Christian Science.
In approaching the Investigation of
this subject one should do so with an
open mind. Christian Science is produc
ing certain very definite and very
beneficial results, and it behooves
every thinking person to try to under
stand how they are accomplished.
Both in the medical profession and
among the clergy there are many such
open-minded Rtudents, with the result
that some eminent physicians are now
sending to Christian Science practi
tioners thoso of their patients who do
not recover under medical treatment;
while many clergymen are openly de
claring from their pulpits that the
fruits of Christian Science are good,
and not a few of them have left their
pulpits to become Christian Science
practitioners, These facts are worthy
of serious consideration.
If it is true that Christian Science is
teaching people how to rise above sin
ful appetites and desires, and how to
be healthy and happy, then surely it
is the greatest and most vital thing
that can engago human thought. That
Christian Science does these things to
some extent at least is no longer an
open question, and the proof of it is to
be found in the practical benefits that
have come to its adherents.
Although the healing of physical and
mental diseases by spiritual means
was widely practiced, both in Old
Testament and New Testament times,
and was expressly commanded by
Jesus, and, although Christian Science
during the last 50 years has actually
healed in this way large numbers of
people from all kinds of physical and
mental diseases, there are still a great
many people who honestly find it
difficult to understand how it Is pos
sible for the sick to be healed without
drugs, and entirely by spiritual means,
Kven among those who profess to be
lieve In the Bible and in the omnipo
tence of God, there are many who have
honest doubts that the power of God
is sufficient or available to deliver
from sickness, and these doubts often
prevent tho effort to gain an under
standing of the way by which spiritual
healing is accomplished.
To all such it can be said that Jesus
healed the sick without drugs, and
what is more important to us, he
taught other people how to do so, thus
proving that his method of healing
physical disease by spiritual means
could be taught to others, and under
stood and practiced by them.
Later these same disciples taught
tho Principle of spiritual healing whicn
they had learned from Jesus to their
own disciples and history shows that
on down through a period of about ten
generations the healing of the sick by
spiritual means continued to be a part
of the regular ministry of the Chris
tlon church, and that the dead were
raised during the first and second cen
turles. Moses and the prophets also
healed the sick and raised the dead
and did many other wonderful works
in demonstration of the power of spirit
to meet human needs, and the Old
Testament is filled with such in
stances.
It will thus be seen that the knowl
edge of spiritual truth, and tho method
or. its application to deliver people
from sickness, sin. nnd every kind of
evil human condition has reappeared
upon the earth nt many times, and It
is claimed for Christian Science that
it is the reappearance in our own gen
eration of the understanding of the
same spiritual law that was known and
understood in part by Moses and the
prophets, and which was perfectly un
derstood and demonstrated by Jesus,
and bv him tauuht to his disciples.
'V. ' ,e is no mystery about it, and the
, f0 rodueed by Christian Science
are ... VA-"53 which llave always fol
lowed, ai. . -.necessarily ioiiow,
from the app. ,n and demonstra
tion of spirituv . truth. Christian
Science is nothing more nor less than
a return to primitive Christianity, and
every one who turns to it fairly and
honestly will find in it that which will
satisfy his spiritual aspirations and
meet his human needs.
Mrs. Eddy's Discovery of Christian
Science.
Mrs. F.ddy is acknowleged to be the
Discover and rounder of Christian
Science, and many people ask what it
is that she has discovered. In reply
it can be said that she has discovered
the Law of Spirit which is Spiritual
Truth.
Mrs. Eddy discovered the law of
Spirit as truly as Sir Isaac .Newton
discovered the law of gravitation, and
this fact should be thoroughly under
stood. Just as Newton discovered that
the movements of material bodies were
regulated and governed by this mater
ial law. so Mrs. Kddy discovered the
Principle that governs tho entire uni
verse, including every detail in the
lives of men. That supreme, creative,
governing, omnipresent Mind of Prin
ciple, is God, the only Cause, the only
Creator, the only Ruler of man and
the universe.

LOST IN FINAL GAME
High School Closed Baseball Season
With Overwhelming Defeat.
Bennington high school's baseball
team closed Its season Friday alter
noon with nn overwhelming defeat at
the hands of the St. Albans high school
nine. The students from the railroad
city scored 1ti runs while the best that
the Bennington school boys could do
was to tally four times in the fourth
Inning. And but for the wildness of
the St. Albuns Ditcher it is to be
doubted that, thev would have made
any one of the four runs.
Tho Bennington boys did not play
such a ragged game In Hie field, only
six errors being chalked up against
them, but the way those St. Albans
players banged the ball to all corners
of the lot was disheartening. They
hntted Leahy and Parsons for 19 hits
and some of the swats went for extra
bases.

INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE
North Bennington Veteran Has Treas
ured Letters Written by Famous
Confederate Raider.
Editor of the Banner:
The recent death of Col. John S.
Mosby at Washington calls to my mind
an incident of my experience in the
Civil War which may bo of interest to
the old soldiers, and possibly to others
who are familiar with the exploits Oi
this man during the Civil War as a
scout in chief of the Confedreate
Army.
1 refer to some correspondence
which took place between Col. Mosby
and myself some time ago, which was
as follows:
"Col. John S. Mosby,
Washington, D. C.
Dear Sir:
1 am writing to you on a subject
of considerable interest to me, hop
ing you may be able to give me
some Information. One night dur
ing the latter part of the Civil
War, I was riding with one or two
others along the Chantilly Pike
near Alexandria, Va. It was about
midnight, and very dark. A party
of "Mosby s Men', as we usee, to
call tin ni, halted us, and began
firing at us. We suspected they
were attacking army trains that
were moving along tho Pike. We
could not see any distance ahead
of us. An attempt was made to
capture us. However, we made
our escape under the darkness of
the night.
I am interested to know If you
can recall the circumstance. Pos
sibly you wete present yourself."
To this I received an answer, in the
handwriting of Col. Mosby. as follows:
"The Alamo, Washington, I). C.
Dec. IS. P.U3.
Henry T. Cushman,
North Bennington Vt.
My Dear Sir:
Your letter just received. 1 think
the occasion you refer to was near
Chantilly on the Pike In October
18(13, when Meade retired from
tho Rapldan, and Lee advanced.
I was personally present that
night, and I remember very well
capturing a number of wagons, and
driving off the mules, and taking
some prisoners. One was a ('apt.
Barton of Gen. Kustis" start. One
was a Private Moss, of Boston. I
became to know them after the
war, and they weie my warm
friends. 1 also remember some
shots being tired, and the escape of
those at whom they were fired.
I had lelt the main body
of my command a mile or
so behind, and with about a
dozen men went on the Pike to
rcconnolter. We kept up this an
noyance (to you) or fun (to us)
for two days.
I would like very much to meet
you, nnd also some of the First
Vermont Cavalry, with whom I hail
several collisions. I am sending
vou a half tone copy of a picture
of myself taken a few months af
ter the close of the war.
Very truly,
(Signed) John S. Mosby"
It will be remembered by Benning
ton people that Frank II. Ray was
Captain of one of the Companies of
the First Vermont Cavalry, and it was
said of him that he was one of the
finest soldiers In the Cavalry Brigade.
I wrote Col. Mosby another letter in
December, In which, among other
Ihlngs, 1 wrote the following:
"My dear Sir:
1 nm In receipt of your letter of
the 18th. and I assure you It gives
me great pleasure to know that
you remember so vividly the oc
casion of that October night in
1803 on Chantilly Pike, and I thank
you very much that you were will
ing to take the pains to write me
so minutely about it.
I received your picture by mail
last evening, and 1 thank you very
much for It. 1 am enclosing here
with one of myself taken some
time after tho war.

AT CHICAGO CONVENTION
Austrians Polled Back on Battle
Front 94 Miles Long
LIQUID FIRE ATTACK FAILS
French Repulse Four Successive
saults Upon Hill 304 in One
As-
London, June 10. Information has
reached the Russian embassy In Rome
that the Austrian front has been com
pletely broken along u lengtli of 94
miles to a depth of 37 12 miles. The
Russian advance according to these ad
vices now threatens to envelop the en
tire Austrian army In the region affect
ed, the Austrians finding themselves
attacked from both the east and the
north. Austrian Slav regiments are de
clared to have been seized with panic
during' the first attacks by the Rus
sians and to have surrendered without
any real resistance.
A Reuter dispatch from Potrograd
yesterday reports the continuation of
the Russian successes in Volhynia and
Galicia. The capture or an additional
1S5 officers and 13,714 men is an
nounced. It Is announced at the Austro-Hun-garian
headquarters under date of
June 8 that the Austro-I Bulgarian
troops In Volhynia have reached new
positions on the river Styr alter rear
guard engagements with the Russians
says a dispatch from Berlin. It is
also stated that the Russians are again
attacking with strong forces on the
lower Stripa In Galicia and that
engagements have not yet been
ished.
Five days of furious offensive
the forces ot Gen Bussiloff
(rumpled the enemy's lines from
the
fin-
by
has
the
Kovel sarny railway line to Bukow
ina. driving them back an average of
15 miles, says a dispatch from Potro
grad. hi the Lutsk sector the Rus
sians appear to hae broken through
completely, tinning the lelt flank of
the Austrian nrmies and the right
Hank of the German forces and cap
turing Lutsk, tho center of a num
ber of radiating roads and railways.
At several points the attacking Rus
sians have crossed the Ikwa and
Styr rivers, and further south they
are approaching the Stripa river.
The victories are attributable
largely to the avalanche of gunfire,
which swept away dozens of lines
ot on'anglemoiits and opened the
way for the troops, who swept
through iiilrreslstihlo numbers. In
some places the Russian barrier fire
cut off large Austrian units which
surrendered. This accounts for tho
large number of prisoners olficially re
poi ted captured.
Lutsk Is an important link, strength
ening the connection between the
southwestern region and the north
ern section and the possession of
it by the Hussions is regarded as a
valuable step toward the recaptur
ing of lost territory. The possession
of Lutsk is a direct menace to Lorn
berg, upon which place the Austrians
are now mussing their forces.
London. June It. The German arm
les made big attacks on both banks of
the Mcuse today and last night. To
the east of the river In the region of
Thiauiuont Farm violent drives last
night succeeded in penetrating one ad
vanced French trench. On tho other
hank, in the neighborhood of Hill 3i4,
the Germans made four attacks during
the day. which were accompanied by
the use of their blazing liquids. These
attacks "fulled completely under our
curtain fires and tho lire of our mitrail
leuses,'' says the Paris statement to
night.
The Berlin official statement de
clares the fighting east of the Mouse1
"is continuing In our lavor."
Paris, June !'. By a week of unin
tertui'led attacks, in which it is said
a number of divisions were destroyed,
the Germans have advanced their lines
about one mile. They have taken the
southern part of Calllette Wood, part
of the Chapltre Wood. Danloup vil
lage and Vnux Fort. In past wars the
enemy's progress on the right would
have compelled the French to fall back
automatically from the Douaumont
Thloumont lines, but under the preset'
conditions It has been found that such
a saw-toothed front can be held. Tin
French found this to their udvant.igt
In the great Champagne offensive.
Former President Unanimous
Choice oi Bull Moose Delegates
NO STATEMENT TO MAKE
Colonel Had Nothing to Say When
News of Selection Was Flashed to
Him at Oyster Bay.
Chicago, June 10. Theodore Roose
velt was today nominated for president
in the first ballot taken in the national
progressive convention.
The news of his nomination was
communicated to the former president
at his home at Oyster Bay and he re
plied that he had no statement to
make.
Following the nomination of Roose
velt the progressive convention took a
uccss until 3 o'clock.
Progressive Convention
After three sessions thut ran
through the gamut of emotions from
hysteria for Mr. Roosevelt to a calm,
dispassionate discussion of planks In
the platform, the convention adjourned
at 9.5S last night until 10.30 today.
It was only after repeated assurances
from the leaders that Col Roosevelt
himself desired that the nomination he
postponed that the delegates swal
lowed their own convictions that the
nomination was the real and only busi
ness to be considered and consented
to quit the hall for the night.
All t ho day the delegates kept on
guard, while the leaders watched or
listened over the telephone, to detect
any unexpected move on the part of
the republicans. As the ballots were
taken in the Coliseum they waited and
listened and kept their tempers. They
were told they must "keep the faith,"
and allow two ballots to be taken by
the republicans according to the agree
incut between the peace conferees and
approved by Col. Roosevelt himseit
The approval of the colonel was a
tiuinp card held up the sltc'ves of the
leaders, but never played, for when
the Coliseum quit for the night the
delegates, tired out with long sitting
in the hot, sticky theater, were willing
to await for a nomination.
One of the incidents of the day and
one of the most dramatic, was the sud
den appearance upon the platform of
Senator Borah of Idaho, a delegate to
the Republican convention and one of
tho peace conferees. He got a recep
tion that swelled out Into the streets
and when he began to speak the old
temper for Rocscvelt named out again.
The sinator spoke briefly. He hoped
for harmony and peace and the spirit
of get. together, but he promised to fol
low Mr. Roosevelt w ith ail the ardor be
was capable of. If he should be the
nominee of the two parties.
There was little routine business
during the niulit. The platform was
tintatively agreed upon with only a
few changes. A fight to insert a pro
hibition plank was beaten by a vote
of .'23 to 82 alter the leaders had ex
plained at length that to put it in
meant that prohibition and not Amer
icanism would then become the main
issue of the coming campaign.
For the rest the delegates just cheer
ed and listened. Realizing that an out
break might be averted only by keep
ing them In good humor, the leaders
recognized man after man in the hall,
called them to the platform and allow
ed them to play on the crowd und its
sense of humor.
Before adjournment the delegates
were told of the result of the first two
ballots at the Coliseum. They took
comfort from the vote for Mr. Roose
velt, and the motion to end the session
was unopposed.
lames R. Garfield of Ohio made the
adjournment motion and the delegates
lelt the hall, just twelve hours after
they hail entered It this morning.
Senator Smoot read tho report of
the peace conferees as follows:
Your committee appointed pursuant
to the resolution adopted nt yester
day's session met In conference with
a committee representing the national
progressive convention last evening
The progressive committee of confer
etice consisted of Messrs Perkins ol
New York. Johnson of California, Bo
mumrtc of Maryland. Wilkinson of
New York and Parker of Louisiana
The conference was frank, free and
most friendly. The conferees were of
one mind In believing thut the good
of the country, and perhaps Its repute
und Influence for years to come, de
ponds on the complete defeat of the
present democratic
administration
and the restoration of the control

President on Republican Ticket on First Ballot
the executive and legislative branches
of the government to the hands of
those who firmly believe in and will
execute the policies that are so
heartily supported by the republican
und the progiessive parties alike.
The progressive conferees were
unanimous in arguing with temper
ateiiess and fairness the opinion that
Theodore Roosevelt of New York had
so large a personal following and such
a close personal relation to the issues
of the coining campaign as to make
him the most desirable candidate upon
which to unite.
It was agreed that your conferees
would report these facts to this con
vention. When Mr. Smott came to the an
nouncement that the progressives had
urged that Col. Roosevelt had the at
tributes of "the most desirable candi
date upon which to unite,' there were
applause, cheers and some hisses.
There were cries of "Roosevelt," a
jangling of cowbells and more cheers.
Senator Smoot held up his hand for
silence, but the demonstration, coin
ing from different places on the lloor
and galleries, continued. Some few
tried to hiss down the demonstration.
At cries of "Order, order," Chairman
Harding banged the gavel, and the
noise subsided. Scattering applause
and some laughter marked the close of
tho reading.
The roll of states was called, and
Alabama and Alaska passed. Arizona
yielded to New York. An Arizona
member challenged the yielding, and
the delegation was polled. All voted
aye. A man In the delegation who
voted in the place of Delegate Wright
bi cause be said he had Wright's
"badge and credentials," was put
out and the alternate who took
Wright's place voted "no". The "ayes"
had it, however, and Gov. Whitman
of New York was recognized nnd took
the platform to nominate Justice
Hughes. The demonstration subsided
while Gov. Whitman was introduced.

Chicago, June 10. Charles E.
Hughes of New York was nominated
for president .on the first ballot taken,
today by the national republican con
vention. The nomination was almost
unanimous. As was predicted early
in the forenoon the supporters of tho
favorite sons turned in to support tho
leading candidate and scattering votes
from all sections helped to swell tho
majority.
The unofficial report of the ballot is
as follows: Hughes, 949 1-2; Roose
velt, 18 1-2; Dupont, 5; Weeks, 3;
Lodge, 7; Lafollette, 3.
Charles W. Fairbanks of Indiana was
nominated for vice president.
Justice Hughes was informed by
Chairman Harding of the nominations
and received a reply that the republi
can nominee would make a statement
later in the afternoon.
Chicago, June 10. Justice Hughes
led the field and gained strength on the
two only ballots taken yesterday in the
republican national convention. His
supporters, confident that another bal
lot would give him a majority, resisted
adjournment, but the convention, tired
and worn with a continuous 10 hourses
sion was determined to rest and ad
journed until 11 o'clock this morning.
H was the first time since 1888 that a
republican convention has taken more
than one ballot to choose a presidential
nominee
On the first ballot Justice Hughes -polled
25a 1-2 votes. He got 42 from
his own state and aside from Oregon
and Florida the remainder were large
ly scattering. On the second ballot
he increased to 328 1-2 votes. ' It re
quired 049 voles to nominate. Col.

fust day's balloting wus 81 votes. Be
sides Justice Hughes, the colonel and
Charles W. Fairbanks, of all the 18
men who had votes on the tirst ballot,
alone made an increaso on tho second.
The expected demonstration for Col.
Roosevelt when he was nominated by
Senator Fall of New Mexico lasted 41
minutes and broke tho record for this
convention. All observers agreed that
it was largely a gallery demonstration
and that the participation was scatter
ing from the delegate section. The
Fairbanks demonstration ran next
with 35 minutes, the Burton demon
stration lasted 31 minutes and the
Hughes demonstration lasted 20 min
utes.
On the first ballot the delegates fol
lowed their instructions, voting for
favorite sons and primary choices.
Senator Weeks got 105; lihu Root
103, Cummins 85, Fairbanks 74 1-2,
Sherman tiO, Roosevelt CZ, and Knox

scattering included complimentary
votes for Borah, Willis and McCall and
the instructed vote for other candi
dates. On the second ballot Michigan
turned 3H over to Hughes and gave
Roosevelt two; McCall of Massachu
setts turned his vote to the justice
amid great applause; Senator Lodge,
who had nominated Senator Weeks,
turned his vote to Col. Roosevelt; W.
