By JAMES J. MONTAGUE.
(Internatiaaal New. Serviee.)
Chicago, June 9.-Charles E. Hughes was far in the lead in the
race for the Republican nomination at the end of the second ballot.
which closed the convention tonight. He had 328V2 votes, a gain of
75 over the number he received on the first ballot. Root was second
with 98V2. Roosevelt gained 16.
Hughes still lacks 165% votes of the number required to gim
him the nomination. These, his supporters insist, he will receive
when the battle is resumed tomorrow morning.
Meanwhile the conference committee from the Progressive and
Republican conventions has again gone into session, in a endeavor
to agree upon a candidate. Up to midnight this efort had been as
fruitless as that of the night before. The Progressives restrained
their impulse to nominate Roosevelt all day long.
MOOSE MAY SUP HALTER.
Whether they can be restrained tomorrow or not even their lead
ers will not say.
The Hughes vote on the first and second ballots tonight was not
the full strength of the Hughes candidacy. This was deliberately
withheld because of a fear on the part of the Hughes people that it
might end in the nommiation of Hughes which would be regarded as
bad faith by the Progressives. The Republicans and especially the
supporters of Hughes among them, want no break with the Pro
gressives if ii can be possibly avoided.
At the end of the second ballot the Hughes people tried to force
a third ballot, but were overruled by the majority and an adjournment
was taken until 11 o'clock tomorrow.
IN SESSION NINE HOURS.
The balloting began at 7:28 afte: an uninterrupted session of
nine hours and twenty-eight minutes of speech-making. Hughes'
lead was manifested almost immediately. He received 2532 votes
on the first ballot. John W. Weeks, of Massachusetts. being his next
competitor with 105. and Elihu Root following with 103. Roosevelt
received only 65. The remaining votes were scattered among favorite
sons.
On the second ballot Hughes began to gain slowly but surely.
Alabama, the first State called, gave him a gain of one. Following
came California. contributing two more; Georgia. 1; Louisiana, 2;
Maine, 2; Massachusetts, which after a poll gave 8 additional Hughes
votes, taken from Weeks; Missouri. 4; Nevada, 4; Idaho, 4; New
Jersey, 4; New York, which had stood on the first ballot, Root, 43;
H hes, 42; Roosevelt, 2, swung around cn the second to Hughes, 43;
R3t, 42; Roosevelt, 2. The big swing was in Michigan. where the
Justice got 28 new votes, all taken from Henry Ford. who got the
solid delegation of 30 votes on the first ballot. Roosevelt got the two
other votes on the second ballot.
