where It began without an agree

Arguments For Hnghes.
"Ills availability as a candidate rests.
first upon his known character and
ability: second upon his public service
as governor of New York; third his
removal from any association with the
convention of 1912, and the differences
which then arose.
"The supporters of justice Hughes. In
the Republican convention, repr'-ent
spontaneous interest and belief in his
candidacy, which have shown them-
selves in widely scattered states and
among all classes and groups c ' voters.
inese have shown themselves with
out any formal organization in his be
half and are our ground for believing
that the candidacy would be acceptable
to all groups of Republicans and wonld
reunite them.
"His silence as to recent issues is the
necessary result of his judicial posi
tion. His earlier speeches anl declara
tions, however, give ground for the
assurance that he is in accord with
the platform that has been adopted by
the Republican and Progressive con
ventlons. !

The automobile and acevseory men are awaiting a proposition from E.

to be held here in October, regarding an auto show m connection with the

oi the show.
Tbe dates are a bit early for the auto men but it is believed tbe large
attendance will more than make up for a bit of rush in getting tbe new
models. The El Pao Auto Dealers aaMciation has not been approached up
to Friday night but president Ben L. Oemeats stated that the association
would' certainly give the matter consideration though it M hardljr possible to
expect that the El Paso dealers can make the same outlay as was made by
