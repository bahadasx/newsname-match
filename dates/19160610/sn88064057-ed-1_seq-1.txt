Leguminous Crops That May! t
Be Planted With Corn. P
The planting in corn of a sum
mer growing legume, particularly a'
cow peas. velvet beans and soy.
beans, is to be very strongly com
mended. They not only add ni
trogen to the soil and enrich it for
subsequent crops but they aid in a
maintaining it in a condition of
tilth. The amount of water thrown
off through the leaves by a crop of
cow peas is smaller than the amount P
of water lost through evaporation 0
from the bare surface of the soil. 1
If a crop of corn is esired for seed ti
purposes, a bunch pea should be c
planted, such as the New Era, or "
the Groit, or Brabham, three of
the best varieties of peas introduced c'
in recent years. These varieties a'
will not make sufficient vine to in
terfere with the proper drying out r
of the ear of corn, or with examin
ing the stalks and ear in the field
selection of seed.
Ordinarily soy beans are not a
very desirable crop to combine
with early corn. They have to be a
planted after the soil is thoroughly i
warm and to properly combine

at least two cul 'i\ation. They
have an erect stalk and do not
shade the ground so well as cow
peas. Soy beans planted at the I
last cultivation of the corn have
almost uniformly been a complete
failure. Where it is desirable to
have soy beans to mix with corn c
for silage purposes, it is best to
plant one row of corn and one row
of soy beans or velvet beans may
be planted in late corn at the same c
time the corn is planted and all "
cultivated together. Velvet beans
make a mutclh heavier growth of
vines than cow peas and almost
completely envelop the corn, and
are, therefore, not desirable where
the production of grain is a prima- c
