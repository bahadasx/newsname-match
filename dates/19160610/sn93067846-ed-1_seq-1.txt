"We were coming from Copenhagen

of the Norwegian women, "when we
saw a Zeppelin hovering far above us

guns. The next thing we saw was two
blazing s lips on the horizon and short?

wreckage, amid which we found seven

of bodies floating around.
"In spite of the great danger from
floating n Ines, our captain brought his
ship close to the buoy nnd we heard
one of tho men say: 'We are alive.'
Yes, they were alive In that sea of
dead. Two died from exhaustion and
we were .ust able to drag the others
back from the edge of the grave.
When we took them on board they
were only able to utter the words:
?From Stork,' 'went down,' 'battle.'"

Lancaster, June. 5.?This afternoon
about 3 o'clock, three miles north of
this place, Dave Short, a well-known
negro farmer of this county, shot and

trivial matter, and after leaving her
dead about forty-five minutes later
killed himself with the same gun,
which he managed to fire by pressing
a forked stick against the trigger of
the gun, the muzzle of which he
held against his heart.
An inquest was held this evening
over both bodies by Magistrate John
L. Caskey, acting coroner, and the
verdict was to the eeffct that Mag
Short, the wife, came to her death
by gunshot wounds at the hands of

Dave Short committed suicide. Sher?

by automobile to the scene of the
killing, where they found both ne?

NO PEACE PLANS.
President Wilson Will Make No Move

CLEMSQN MEN GET DIPLOMAS
CLASS OF 118 COMPLETE COURSE
AND FACE WORK I? WORLD.
Dr. J. L. Coulter of Wrest Virginia De?
livers Annual Commencement Ad?
dress?Dr. Riggs in Farewell Re?
marks (Jives Graduates Advice.
Clemson College, June 6.?The
graduation exercises and the delivery
of diplomas to the 118 young men of
(the class of 1916 were held in Me?
morial hall this morning beginning at
10:30 o'clock. On the stage were Dr.
W. M. Riggs, president of the college;
Dr. J. L. Coulter of West Virginia, the
orator of the day, the two senior class
speakers, the entire faculty of the in?
stitution and a number of the board
of trustees and other distinguished
visitors.
Dr. Riggs welcomed the vast assem?
blage in a few fitting words and In?
troduced the two senior representa?
tives, W. A. Morrison of Clemson col?
lege, whose speech was on "The Ben?
efits of War," and R. B. Waters of
Rock Hill, whose subject was "Prac
tical Patriotism."
Dr. John Lee Coulter of Morgan
town, W. Va.f then addressed the
senior class in a very scholarly but
practical oration. His address was a
notable one full of that kind of elo?
quence that sinks Into the minds and
hearts of people rather than that of
the flowery declaiming speech maker.
Dr. Coulter's address was on "Indi?
vidual Preparedness." He spoke of
the great mass of discussion nowadays
on national preparedness, but said he
wanted to talk of the necessity of be?
ing individually prepared to take one's
place in the world's work and its op?
portunities and duties. He discussed as
elements of individual preparedness
i the qualities of thoroughness, persist?
ence, foresight and the heart qualities
that makes a man love ond consecrate
himself to his sphere of activity. Alan
Johnstone, chairman of the board of
trustees, spoke briefly authorizing the
faculty to confer the degrees and then
Dr. Riggs made a brief farewell talk
to the class. The class of 1916 Is the
ir^?M^lf*$ysjr gsgjAuatadi frop& thls(g4v>nt
institution and an impressive sight it
was to see 118 young men march upon
the stage by course groups and re?
ceive their diplomas at the hands of
Dr. Riggs in the simple but effective
manner characteristic of him.
Following the address of Dr. J. L.
Coulter, President W. M. Riggs ad?
dressed the senior class of 118 men
with the following words of advice:
"It is your good fortune, young men
of the graduating class, to finish your
education in a year when the country
is very prosperous. It is a rare time
for trained men, for under present
conditions, opportunity readily ripens
into success.
"The old idea in education was to
impart culture, its purpose to train
the individual for a greater enjoyment
of a larger life?Its viewpoint was In?
dividualistic and selfish. The modern
idea in education Is to train for ser?
vice?its aim to qualify the individual
to make a maximum contribution to
the sum total of human knowledge
and human progress.
"In a peculiar sense, every educated
man owes the world a service, and the
college has failed of its purpose if It
has no implanted in your hearts a
willingness to serve and what is equal?
ly Important qualified you for that
service.
"For education is not an exit from
the field of labor, but an entrance to
it. It is not a release from toll but
a deliverance from that one remaining
form of human slavery?ignorant and
undirected toiling.
"The cause of education Is the cause
of freedom against the tyranny of Ig?
norance, knowledge against mere tra?
dition, the cause of honest government
against the machinations of dema?
gogues and knaves.
"As educated men I would have the
people of your community think of
you in the terms in which President
Wilson expressed his idea of what
I America should'be as a neutral na
j tion?'lit beyond others to exhibit the
jfine poise of undisturbed judgment,
Jthe dignity of self-eontrol, the effl
cieney of dispassionate actions.'
"Clemson college, which has sought
to help prepare you for a useful life,
has right to expect you to be her
! loyal sons. In the State there Is much
Ignorance regarding the college that
needs to be dispelled, some prejudice
that needs to be combated, some un?
worthy political persecution and abuse
that need to be rebuked at the polls.
"I have awarded diplomas to you.
the largest graduating class in the
history of the college, with mingled
feelings of elation and regret. Elation
when I think of what you have ac?
complished, and what the college has
accomplished not only for yon, but for
the State and nation; regret, because

TWENTY-TWO GRADUATES RE
CEIVE DIPLOMAS.
Address by Dr. Sykes Newly Elect?
ed President, Wlio Gives Words of
Timely Advice?Announcement of
Gift From General Education Board
Hartsville, June 6.?With the grad?
uating exercises tonight the eighth
session of Coker college came to a
close. The session has been notable
in a number of respects. The student
body has been the largest in the his?
tory of the intsitution and the grad?
uating class o' 22 is the largest the
school has 1- .1. Besides the 22
young worn' ,io received the degree
of bachelo arts, six received asso?
ciate In ? .c degrees, four certifi?
cates in tf .estic science, one In ex
pressic * ,d four in music.
Th ^? .ress to the graduating class,
mar" ?* the newly elected president,
Dr ~ vV". Sykes, was both timely and
f y .ng. Dr. Sykes stresed the im
?j? jtnee of preparation for life and
value of a college education as a
^tor in preparation. He declared that
a college education should give the
power to see straight, to reason logi?
cally and to feel sympathetically. The
great subject of thought of the age we
are now In is, he said, the school prob?
lem, how to get the best of life
to which Carlyle and Ruskin devoted
the ripest years of their lives. It is
this problem to which the college
trained woman should address her?
self. After a speech that held the
closest attention of the audience, the
I degrees were conferred and an?
nouncement was made of the gift of
$60,000 from the general education
board of New York, a gift especially
appreciated because of the recognition
which It means of effective service on
the part of the college.

Washington, June 7.?Secretary
Lansing declined today to indicate
when a reply will be made to Car?

I am sorry that you have reached the
emd of your stay here.
"No senior class has been more
harmonious in its own organization,
more loyal to the college and its dis?
cipline, more honorable and upright
in every personal and official relation*
Somehow I feel closer to the class of
1916 than to any one that has grad?
uated under my administration, be?
cause I am able to count many of you
not only as my graduates, but as warm
personal friends as well. I am only
sorry that I have not been able to
know every one of you In an Intimate
personal way.
"As worthy and full-fledged alumni
of Clemson college I salute you, and
wish for you all the good that can
come to a life of faithful service."
