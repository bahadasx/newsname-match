I PROGRESSIVES
AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO, June lO.Facing a wide-open
split in the party and a floor fight of sensational proportions, the
progressive convention came together today under the highest
pressure that has yet marked its superheated sessions.
These chief developments were the prelude to the session:
The conference committee of the mocse and republicans failed
to agree.
George W. Perkins demanded that the convention grant him
more time to negotiate under threat of dropping the chairmanship
if the convention acted at once.
At a session of leaders held before the convention in Perkins
room at the Blackstone hotel numerous charges were made that
the inner circle of party leaders was preparing to sidetrack the
progressives for a republican deal.
Gov. Hiram Johnson announced that he would not take the
progressive nomination if Col. Roosevelt declined it. A second
conference of the moose and republican committees was attempted
at 9:30 o'clock.
George W. Perkins attended it. Gov. Johnson und Charles J.
Bonaparte declined to do so. It lasted but a few minutes, got no
result and Perkins returned to his room to plead for more time.
Cleorge W. I'erkins. chairman of
the executive committee of the pro
gressive party, heM ;i long confer
ence with the state chairmen of the
moose today and urged them to de
fer definite action in the convention
lending the result of further pence
negotiations with leaders of the re- j U;1S
publican party. From Mr. Perkins
attitude it was evident that the pro
gressive leaders were anxious to take
no step that would cause the (I. o.
I, to decide immediately upon ;i
candidate.
It developed at the conference
that a movement which had heen
inaugurated to eliminate Theodore
Itoosevelt because the former presi
dent had not given the word to pro
ceed, would have wo significance.
The insurgents wanted C.ov. Hiram
Johnson of California to become
1 hep -.tundard hearer, hut th ?o er
ror sduelched the scheme, declaring
that he would not accept the nomi
nation. "t.'nder no circumstances could I
take the nomination." said Hov.
.Iohnon. "We are going to nominate
Cc. Koosevclt tliis morning I hope.
Itegrels Misinterpretation.
"I regret ery much that in some
nuartrs my speech of last night was
misinterpreted, so as to make it ap
pear that I. by inference, charged
Fol. Koosevclt with prospective de
sertion of the progressive party.
Nothing was farther from my in
tention." Gov. Johnson was c.illed into .1
onfereme of the leaders. The Pud
ers were standing in an excited
group while various members ad
dressed thm. Hoan Ix wis presided
over the nv'ftin. Several of tin
state chairmen insisted upon an im
mediate nomination. Purine th
ojrse of the meeting Mr. IVvkir.s
. nd the members "f the conference
j ft for the Chicago club to atteml
the conference sessions. He do-lined
angrily to reply to the question as
to whether or not Fol. Mo.see!t
would decline the moose nomination.
IVrkin i. Aicrv.
"V011 ought to Know better than
to as me such a question." he said
to his interviewers.

.News Trawls Fast.
The news traveled like wildfire
am.onir the moose delegates that the
conference had failed and that there
evidence of a landslide to
Hughes in the republican conven
tion. That information caused the
moo-e to prepare for immediate
nomination at the Auditorium. Hut
they confessed that something from
Oyster May mii;ht delay the expected
action, and there was a stolid deter
mined atmosphere surrounding the
arly comers. Few of them had any
idea why Perkins had called their
state chairmen to meet.
The few who hail any inside infor
mation said that the advice divert
in the Holy Writ by the town clerk
of Kphesus was being1 repeated to
their minor chiefs. Students of the
SVriptures will recall that the town
clerk pleaded with the multitude not
to do anything rashly and the F'ack
stone advice was supposed to be in
t mh-d to prevent the moose from
running away while there yet re
mained a conference prospect, how
e er small.
The radical representatives of the
moose element frankly said that
there was not a chance of anything
nunin; from Chicago that miht
( larify the situation, but they ad
mitted the possibility that oyster
Fay miuht bring about new and
sta rtling development.
Gov. Johnson and his followers
did not believe that the possibility
would develop into a probability.
Tlo re had been made every ar
rangement for the moose to nomi
1 ate in record time. The program
was hxed to put the colonel through
in record time ano a great demon
stration and fervor that has not been
surpassed even in this perfervid
gat hering.
Fharles j. F.onaparte. attorney
General in the Ilooseelt cabinet,
hinted that the progiessiv.es would
make their nomination. He was
asked what had developed and re
plied: 1 think thai there will le a irreat

Charles Kvans Hughes by the re
publican convention on the first or

The "favorite sons" had been well

to get the Sherman strength if early
plans were followed. Mut should the
progressive leaders and Col. Moo'-o-velt
agree upon any one of four no-n.
the republican peace oommi'tee vvas
