HUGHES RESIGNS AND
WIRES ACCEPTANCE
I'nlii-il I'ifHtf Kurvlu
WASHINGTON, O. C, June 10.
as associate justice of the supreme
by President Wilson.
Hughes then sent Chairman Harding of tho republican national con
vention a telegram stating that ho did not desire the nomination and pre
ferred to remain on the bench, "but at this critical time In our nation'
history, I realize It Is your right to summon and my paramount duty la to
respond.
In an endorsement of the republican platform, Hughes said ho favors
the maintenance of American rights on land and sea- He branded the ad
ministration's Mexican policy as vaccinating, and charged the administra
tion with subordinating the high responsibility of foreign diplomatic Inter,
course to partisan requirements, "presenting to tho world a humiliating
spectacle."
Hughes declared for undivided Americanism, preparedness In every
branch of the army and navy, and ha condemned the administration for
"Inexcusable neglect In this matter.'' He advocates oconomlncal prepared
ness In forefgn trade expansion.
Regarding the Mexican situation, Hughes wrltee:, "We Interfered there
without consistency, and while wo were seeking to 'dictate where wo were
utterly unconcerned, we failed utterly to appreciate and discharge our plain
duty to our citizens."
In regard to diplomatic Intercourse, he aaya:
"Belated efforts have not availed In the restoration of tho prestige
and influence of our nation so unfortunately sacrificed. Brave words have
been used, but they have been stripped of their force by indecision.
"I desire to see diplomacy restored to Its rightful standard, to have
no more sacrifices of national Interests to partisan expediency: to main
tain our rights under International law, Insisting upon all neutral rights,
ond fully performing our international obligations, and, by clear correct
ness, In Justice to our position, dignify our place among nations."
"I stand for Americanism," said he, "knowing no ulterior purposes, a
patriotism single and complete. Wo have one country, and undivided al
legiance Is Intolerable."
Hughes advocated a thorough Industrial and economic preparedness as
well as a war preparedness.
"In view of our abiding Ideals, there lsno danger of militarism ig this
country," said the statement. "We demand adequate provision for na
tional defense. We must have the strength of self respect In our demands,
the strength of an efficient nation, ready to meet any emergency."
The justice says the nation must provide for an enduring prosperity
basis by an intelligent use of congressional powers. Concluding, he sin
cerely hepes:
"That all differences will be forgotten, and that we will have united
effort In a patriotic realisation of our national need and opportunity."
