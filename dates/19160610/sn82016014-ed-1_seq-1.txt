BIT OF REAL NEWS
How State Journal Has Served
Topeka From Chicago.
Bulletin Board and Extra Edi
tions at All Honrs.
From 10 o'clock Friday morning un
til 10 o'clock at night, the State Jour
nal, in regular and extra editions, kept
the people of Topeka informed of
every movement of the convention.
Not a bit of real news happened in
Chicago Friday that was not chron
icled in the State Journal and sold on
the streets.
The Postscript edition at 5 o'clock
is usually the last edition. But not
on Friday. Compositors, stereotypers,
pressmen, editors and other em
ployees were informed that lunch
would be served in the office and all
would remain on duty until the con
vention adjourned at night.
At 5:30 o'clock the first extra ap
peared on the streets. At 7 o'clock
another extra was sold. At 9 o'clock
an extra appeared on the streets giv
ing the result of the - first baUot-Forty-five
minutes later another extra
was on the streets, giving the detailed
results of the last ballot and telling of
adjournment.
An Associated Press leased wire into
the State Journal office was kept go
ing every minute. In addition A. L.
Shultz and Frank P. MacLennan, cor
respondents for the State Journal at
the Coliseum, kept a direct wire from
the Coliseum hot with news of the
Kansas delegation's actions and other
side lights on the exciting events of
the day.
Nor was this the only service sup
plied to Topeka by the State Journal.
The new electric bulletin board in the
front window displayed bulletin after
bulletin, and hundreds in front of the
office maintained hour after hour of
vigil and five minutes after the news
was received in the telegraph editor's
room it was conveyed to the hundreds
of citizens who lined the sidewalk at
Eighth and Kansas avenues.

HOW HE STANDS

Accepts Nomination as His
Duty to Country.
FOREIGN POLICY A FAILURE
National Honor Sacrificed

Preparedness Is Keynote of
Nominee's Strong Edict.
Washington. June 10. Justice
Hughes late today sent a telegram to
Chairman Harding of the Republican
national convention formally accept
ing the Republican nomination foi
the presidency. At the same ume it
was announced the justice had re
signed as associate justice of the
supremo court of the United States.
Justice Hughes sent his resignation
by messenger to President Wilson-
Following is the telegram to Chair
man Harding:
Mr. Chairman and delegates:
"I have not desired the nomination.
I have wished to remain on the bench.
But in this critical period of our na- ,
tional history, I recognize that it is
your right to summon and that it is
my paramount duty to respond. Tou
speak at a time of national exigency
transcending merely partisan consider
ation. You voice the demand for a
dominant, thorough going American
ism with ,-fim- protective upbuilding
policies, so essential to our peace and
security; and to that call, in this crisis,
I cannot fail to answer with the pledge
of all that is in me to the service of
the country. Therefore I accept the
nomination.
"I stand for the firm and unflinch
ing maintenance of all the rights of
American citizens on land and sea. I
neither impugn motives nor underes
timate difficulties. But it is most re
grettably true that in our foreign re
lations we have suffered incalculably
from the week and vacillating course
which has been taken with regard to
Mexico a course lamentably wrong
with regard to both our rights and
duties. We interfered without con
sistency and while seeking to dictate
when we were not concerned, we ut
terly failed to appreciate and dis
charge our plain duty to our own citi
zens. "At the outset of the administration
the high responsibilities of our diplo
matic intercourse with foreign nations
we subordinated to a conception of
partisan requirements and we present
ed to the world a humiliating spec
tacle of inaptitude. Belated efforts
have not availed to recover the influ
ence and prestige so unfortunately
sacrificed and brave words have been
stripped of their force by indecision.
"Our desire to see our diplomacy
restored to its best standards and to
have these advanced; to have no sac
rifices of the national interest to par
tisan expediencies: to have the -first
ability of the country always at its
command here and abroad in diplo
matic intercourse; to maintain firmly
our rights under international law;
insisting scteadfastly upon all our
rights as mutual and fully performing
our international obligations and by
the clear correctness and justness of
our positions and our manifest ability
and disposition to sustain them to
dignify our place among the nations.
"I believe in making prompt pro
vision to secure absolutely our nation
al security. I believe in preparedness,
not only entirely adequate for our de
fense with respect to numbers and
equipment in both army and navy,
but with all thoroughness to the end
that in each branch of the service
there may be utmost efficiency under
the most comoetent heads.
SILENTONHUGHES
Little Enthusiasm Marked
Nomintaion of Justice.
(BY STAFF CORRESPOXDEST.)
Chicago, 111, June 10. On the
nomination of Hughes the balconies
and galleries where the great masses
were seated were almost silent- The
demonstration was practically all
from tbe delegates on the floor.
The notable thing about the Hughes
demonstration, what little there was
to it, was that it was like the Hughes
campaign up to date, apathetic and ex
pressionless so far as Hughes himself
has been concerned; a childish prop
osition; a cold expression noted by
the absence of the great enthusiasm
or hurrah which usually follows such
an incident.
In less than a minute after the an
nouncement of the Hughes nomina
tion there was quiet and a delegate
moved to make Hughes's nomiuation
unanimous. This was applauded for a
quarter of a minute when Chairman
Harding of the convention c lied for
nominations of national committee
men by states.
Kansas named Fred Stanley of
Wichita.
The chairman declared in order
nominations for vice president. Fair
banks was a general cry.

SUPREME COURT
KNOCKS OUT THE
BRIDGE TRUST
Decision Is Handed Down in
Labette County Case.
Suit Brought by Topeka Firms
to Enforce Contract.
COMPETITION I DESTROYED
By the System Hitherto Prac
ticed in Kansas.
Color Line in Second Class
City Schools Abolished.
The alleged bridge trust in Kansas
received a blow in the solar plexus to
day from the Kansas supreme court
when it declared a contract to be ille
gal for a reinforced concrete and steel
bridge in Iabette county. A suit to
enforce this contract was brought by
the Topeka Bridge and Iron company,
one of the firms in the alleged trust.
In short, this breaks up an old plan
employed by bridge companies. It
has been the custom in years past for
a board of county commissioners to
prepare plans and specifications for
bridges and advertise for bids. Usu
ally, the bridge companies would
make a bid on the county's plans and
specifications but at the same time
submit an alternative plan of its own
by which the company would build a
bridge at a lower price and save some
money. But this plan was an exclu
sive one of the bidding company and
excluded competition from other com
panies. The supreme court cornea out flat
footedly and holds that this practice
has destroyed competition in bridge
building in Kansas. It goes even fur
ther and declares that in the future
there must be but one set of plans
and specifications for building a
county bridge. Continuing, the court
holds that plans and specifications
adopted by a county board must be
complete in all details, must be open
to all bidders, and if any changes are
submitted these changes must be sub
mitted to all bidders. This ruling is
expected to put a quietus on activities
of the bridge companies in using pat
ented bridge designs which prevent

On account of the afternoon show

postponement was held off just as long
as possible, but when the rain con

announced that it would be better to

would leave the grounds in better

It was rumored today that "Lefty"

but officials of the club would not
confirm the rumor. However, those

Theodore Roosevelt was nomi

The nomination came in the

speech.
Anxious to nominate before
