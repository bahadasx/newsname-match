court.
CHICAGO, June 10.—A message from Hughes ac
cepting the republican nomination for the presidency
is one its way to Chicago, according to the announce
ment of Chairman Harding just before adjournment
this afternoon.
The nomination came at 12:03

publicans had nominated Hughes.
The nomination came in the
• face of the colonel's own recom
mendation that the progressives
and -republicans united on Sena
tor Lodge.
Bedlam broke loose when
Chairman Robins suspended the
rules, called for the nomination
and announced the result, all

Two Minutes l.ate.
Anxious to nominate before the
republicans nominated Hughes,
Johnson and Colby urged haste.
They jockeyed about, waiting for
word from the republicans, and
the Moose were unable to finish
the nomination until two minutes
after Huges was chosen at the
Colisuni.
The peace conference came to
naught, although the delegates
conferred until early morning
and met again before the con
vention was called to order.
I'i-ged to Accept.
The republicans suggested
Hughes and the progressives de
cided to lay hie name before the
convention, but were too late to
effect v compromise.
Immediately after Roosevelt's
nomination, Johnson telephoned
him urging him to make a state
ment accepting the progressive
nomination.

"That animated feather duster," a tei'in applied

B. Hughes governor of Xew York.
And even (hat fatal mis-speech of the New York
editor changed the res nil by so slight a margin that
on election night, Hughes, believing he was defeat
ed, said to his wife:
"My dear, I congratulate you. You have
escaped tow years of genteel poverty at Albany."
It was a jest, of course, but still it was Hughes

didn't particularly care if the people didn't want '
him to have lt. .
