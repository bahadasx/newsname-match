BRIDGEPORT STENCHES
Why Does the Chicago Health
Department Overlook "Influen-
tial" Soap and Rendering
Works on the South Side That
Are Said to Create Stinks?
Tho Chicago Eaglo Is In receipt of
complaints from south sldo pcoplo
about tho awful smell snld to come
from some alleged soap fnctorles and
rendering works In Bridgeport, whoso
Inlluonco Is said to bo so great with
tho health and sanitary departments
that they can stink as much as they
please.
Property ownors complain that
these stenches pollute tho nlr, lower
property values and, what Is of moro
consequence, undunger health.
Aro not tho lives of people In
Bridgeport and vicinity worthy of or
llclal notlco?
Summer Is hero and the lireczos
waft these smells to all parts of the
city.
MaKIng this kind of perfumery Is
unlawlul. Why Is the' law not en
forcod? Tho tlnio wns when Chlcngo stood

That time Is past and a reckoning
awaits the olllclul who tolerate such
a nuisance now at tho hands of out
