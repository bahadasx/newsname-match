"It is plain that he 'will soon corn

In her will offered for probate to
day Isabelle Jarvis, a former resident
of 433 .West avenue apportions most
of .her estate to her nephew, Stephen
S. Jarvis. and her neices, Susan Jarvis
Miller and BuelaLouise Miller. The
estate is estimated at $5,100, cash in
banks,, stocks, etc. She owned no real
estate. She- mentions this in the will
and asks that inr yiew of this fact no
appraisers be appointed or inventory
be made of the estate. The judge of
the probate" court cannot comply
with this - request, however, as the
new Federal inheritance tax law re
quires that appraisers must be ap
pointed . on every estate, no matter
how small and return made to the
Federal officers.
The will directs that the family
silver be divided between her neices.
She bequeaths $500 to her only liv
ing brother, William H. Jarvis, of
Willmette, 111.,-and $100 to her "good
friend," Minnie F. Foster. She also
directs that $150 be apportioned for
the care of her lot in Mountain Grove
cemetery and that of Levi Lyon,
which adjoins it. She appoints' her
nephew and neices executors and ex

a date for a hearing on the question
of the admission of the will.

Delegates. -
Chicago, June lO Col. Theodore Roosevelt was. nominated
for president by; the Progressive convention today.
The nomination was by acclamation, amid-wild cheering by
delegates; - . '
Chairman Robins' announcement of Roosevelt's nomination
came ajmost simultaneously with-ihe news from the Coliseum
that the Republican convention had named Justice Charles E.
Hughes. I . -
Bainbridge Colby named Roosevelt in a speech that lasted ,
two minutes. A previous parliamentary ruling that nomination
could be made without roll call was grasped by the delegates
when he finished. Roosevelt's nomination went over Jwith a
cheer. . .
The nomination followed a morning of conferences. Peace
meetings with the Republican conferees were held, at whicli Col.
Roosevelt's message urging Senator Lodge, of Massachusetts, as
a compromise candidate were read. The .delegates didn't take
kindly to the Lodge candidacy from the outset.
COLONEL'S SUGGESTION OF LODGE
AS' NOMINEE DELAYS CONVENTIOM
Auditorium. Chicago, June 10
Colonel Roosevelt's suggestion that
Senator Lodge be named as a compro
mise candidate deterred the Progress
ive convention from its early morning
determination to . nominate , Roose
velt within five minutes after the del
egates were called to order.
The delegates 'wanted to go ahead
and -nominate the Colonel. Leaders
advised that they wait the action of
the Republican convention.
Governor . Johnson, of Calif or nisC,
frankly stated that the . Progressives
wouldn't stand for Lodge. Gifford
Pinchot remarked that there was only
thing to do nominate Roosevelt.
George W. Perkins asked the dele
gates to delay action until the Repub
lican convention had considered the
suggestion' of Colonel Roosevelt. Mr.
Perkins had been busy all morning at
various conferences.
As the delegates came into the con
vention hall from ' the peace confer
ence, the delegation chairmen were
pounced upon by the delegates and
got' the word that had gone -forth that
Colonel Roosevelt was to be instantly
named and by acclamation with only
a formal vote for record purposes.
When the leaders deihanded that the
convention be immediately convened.
Chairman Robbins ordered the stage
cleared. . - . ' .
At 10:41 Chairman Robins began
pounding his gavel. There was a
show Of haste to proceed to nomina
tions before the Rpublican conven
tion should convene at ll o'clock.
About one-third of the delegates
were absent -when the opening gavel
fll.
"Let us be seated Quickly," said.
Chairman Robins earnestly. Chair
man Robins announced that the con
vention should proceed "deliberately
and in order,"" and said the first busi
ness was a report from the conference
committee.
Chester R'owell,- of California, told
of the conference of state chairmen.
'Mr, Rowell sejaid they requested that
the convention do not "take any ac
tion until their arrival." "
"How soon will they be here?"
delegates shouted. "Will you wait?"
he asked. "Yes, we'll wait," and
"No. no," were .shouted at Mr.
Rttwell. ' '
"We will wait a reasonable time,"
said Chairman Robins.
Mr. . Robins said the: convention
would then proceed to nominations.
"This is not a time for speeches but
for action," he said, and then sent the
convention into a demonstration by
adding significantly, "We are going
to do just what we came to Chicago
to do."
Chairman Robins . asked that when
the nominating speeches are made
the convention reserve its long ap
plause for the end so that the speak
ers may not 'be interrupted.
Answering demands for an immedi
ate nomination of Roosevelt, Chair
man Robins said the convention
"would not proceed to adopt the plat
form or make nominations" without
giving the conference" committee a
reasonable time to report.
The parliamentary situation was
explained by Secretary Davis, so that,
Chairman Robins explained, the con
vention could if It so desired, make
Its nomination unanimous with a roll
call. .
Captain John M. Parker of New
Orleans, addressed the convention in
behalf of those who "had burned the
bridges behind them," when they join
ed the Progressive party four years
ago. He opposed any compromise
that would effect Col. Roosevelt. His
every sentence was cheered.
Captain Parker, in closing, said:
"Nominate your man and go before
the people on a platform of Ameri
canism." ' . .
PRICE TWO CENTS
Fie
There.was a roar of cheers. When
the demonstration following Parker's
address had been silenced, the plat
form, was foriayy adopted, without
roll call. -
Chairman Robins said the order was
to proceed with nominations for
President and Vice-President. Chair
man O'Connell of New York was rec
ognized for a motion to suspand the
rules and proceed with nominations.
Hamilton Fish, Jr., challenged
O'Connell's' right to speak for a ma
jority delegation. A poll was order
ed. ,
The New York delegation upon be
ing polled rejected the motion to sus
pend the rules and make nominations
the order of business, the vote being
55 to 32. ,
There were calls for" nominations '
and Bainbridge , Colby, of New York,
was recognized to nominate. Theodore
Roosevelt, which he did at the end of
two minutes' talk. Delegates and
spectators cheered wildly but were
checked at once by the chairman.
At the very moment -when it ws's
flashed to the Progressive convention
that Hughes had ,been nominated at
the Coliseum as the standard bearer
of the Republican party. Chairman
Robins of the , Progressive convention
was announcing that Col. Roosevelt
had "been unanimously nominated aa
the Progressives' leader.
The convention went wild and there
aws no way to inform the delegates:
what had transpired at the Coliseum.
As soon as order was restored the
convention recessed until 3 p. m.

ANTI-AMERICA!
DEMONSTRATION
CAUSING WORRY
i ; i"
Washington, June 10 Administra
tion circles were uneasy today over
continued ' reports of anti-American,
demonstrations in Northern Mexico.
Americans in Mexico, fearing serious
riots, are making their way to the .
border in greater numbers and those
seeking to return to Mexico are being
advised against such action by border
agents acting under orders.
Most demonstrations iave gone no
further than mass meetings and
speeches by agitators who resent the
presence of American troops on Mexi
can soil. Carranza troops have sought
usually to disperse such gatherings.
Officials fear Mexican public opinion
may , flare into open rioting directed
against American citizens, although nf
fear is felt for the safety of Genera
Pershing's forces.
