William Allen White, of Kansas, said

tion of Hughes, will be turned down.
The convention was called to order at
10:42 with an air of suppressed excite
ment. Chairman Robins announced the

"That won't make any difference,

By JOHN SNURE.
CHICAGO, June 10. Stormy discus
slon broke out behind closed doors at
the Blackstone Hotel early this morn
ing when the Bull Moose State chair
men conferred with the Bull Moose
leaders, Including tho members of the
t'rogresslve party aide of the peace
committee.
After a short meeting, George W. Per
king was sent to meet tho Republican
members of the peace committee at the
Chicago Club. While he was gone some
or tno speaKers charged there was a
movement on to betray them Into ..the
support of some man other than Roose
velt. Glfford Plnchot, among others, In
dicated resentment.
Perkins and others close to Roosevelt,
with his evident approval, wanted the
Bull Moose to hold back longer on
their nomination until It was definitely
decided by vote what the Republicans
would do.
The radicals opposed this
"We came hore for one thing to
nominate Theodore Roosevelt." said
he. "There Is no occasion to wait
longer."
Indignant because he declared Mr.
Perkins was being criticised In his
absence, David Miller, third partv
chairman from Florida, left the meet
Ing. "I protest against men In there cast
ing suspicion on Mr. Perkins beforo
he has reported," said Miller. "When
men name an ambassador they ought
at least wait for tho report of the
ambassador before attacking him."
Mr. Miller voiced his views freelj
on leaving the rooms where the Bull
Moose were assembled. Others of the
third party men hurried about him
and tried to quiet him and keep him
from talking to newspaper men.
It was disclosed the meeting dis
cussed the question of possible selec
tion of second man If Mr. Roosevelt
suggested it. The question of accept
ing Hughes came up. It was denied
that Roosovelt had yet passed the
word to accept Hughes. The feeling
prevailed In many quarters he would
Everybody stood about on tiptoes
waiting for R sign ns to Just what
tho Colonel would do.
Former Secretary Cortelyou was In
the Bull Moose conference. His
presence was looked upon as likely
to promote acceptance of Hughes.
CHICAGO. June 10. Sentiment for a
Vice Presidential candidate rapidly
crystallised early today with Senator
Borah of Idaho and Charles Fairbanks,
of Indiana, the favorites.
The choice is largely geographical.
Borah Is the "light haired boy" of
both cpnyentions. lie is enthusiastically
liked by the Progressives, but at the
same time has always refused to leave
the G. O. P. ranks.
While Borah for two days has re
fused to yield to strong pressure urging
him to run, It Is the belief of his friends
in both parties that If he received a
whirlwind nomination, the convention
would accept him with a bang before he
could protest.
Fairbanks also has sent out word
that he would not accept the nomination
of Vice President, but this has not been
taken as final.
The choice of a candidate for this
office promises to bring out the cus
tomary number of names, but Fair
banks and Borah have the edge. There
Is a strong desire on tho part of the
delegates now to close up shop and get.
This' has been materially strengthened
'by the weather, and the situation as a
whole may result In quick action on
the Vice Presidency with the list of
candidates somewhat curtailed.

11:22 p. m. Hoots greet Roose
velt's indorsement of Lodge.
11:29 a. m. Roosevelt's telegram

11:49 a. m. Progressive platform

11:51 a. m. Hamilton Fish, Jr.,
declared O'Connell did not represent
real spirit of New York delegation.
12:10 p. m. Bainbridge Colby, of
New Jersey nominated Roosevelt.
What'll he do If he gets It, was the
big question everyone was asking to
day. In considering the likelihood of
the nomination of Justice Hughes by
the Republicans.
Predicated on the supposition that
Hughes 'Will accept, thero were many
conjectures as to whether Hughes would
resign Immediately, nnd leave opinions
he has cleaned up to be ready next
Monday, or whether he would merely
announce his resignation to take effect
some tlmo after Monday.
There was no one who believed
Hughes would delay his resignation a
second longer than he felt waa neces
sary under the law. The matter a;
to whether a justice could resign, and
his opinion bo read afterword, would
be entirely within the Jurisdiction of the
Chief Justice. .
Pnr tho first unin since me iiopuuii-
can convention begain. there wos ap
parent today an atmosphere of tense
ness at the Hiighos household. Tele
phone queries always have been polltcl
but Innocuously answered. Suggestions
that arrangements bo made for the
newspaiwrmen to keep watch at the
House have up to today mot with po
lite but firm refusal.
Lawrence Clrecji. the Jurists secre
tary, todav volunteered irrangements
whereby the newspapermen are to
gather at the Hughes home about tho
time tho third ballot was to be taken Iti
Chicago. ....
Justice Hughes, himself, was as In
accessible ns ever today. Ho took a
short walk alone about S o'clock, and
then retired to his study to "clean up
his work." He had planned for nothing
out of the ordinary In his dally routine,
Secretary Green announced.
11:47 a. m. Convention called to
order.
G. O. P. FLASHES

CHICAGO, June 10.
M. B. Olbrlch, of Wisconsin, was the
only nominator appeal InK with a ti airi
er to handle his water-conled voice. Ho
Just stood there and roared nnd roared
for La Follett. while his runner-up
stood aside drenching his bearings with
glass after glass.
COLISEUM, CHICAGO, June 10. Justice Charles Evans Hughes
was nominated today for President by the G. O. P. on the third ballot.
When the tellers had tolled off the votes of the 494 delegates
necessary to elect a nominee the cheers of the thousands packed in the
hall were deafening.
On the floor where standards bearing the narofesof the States had
xept the space reserved Jfor the actual participants ir this quadrennial
festivity, the scene was one of wild jubilation.
The final vote was: Hughes, 949; Roosevelt, 18; Weeks, 4.
All other candidates except Roosevelt withdrew.
DISORDER RULES AT OPENING HOUR.
John W. McGrath, Colonel Roosevelt's secretary and
personal representative in Chicago, was on the platform at
the Republican meeting at 1 1 o'clock, the hour set for con
vening. Hft conferred with Republican members of the
harmony committee and was evidently attempting to have
them incorporate in their report a statement as to the
Colonel's eleventh-hour indorsement of Senator Lodge as
the compromise candidate.
McGrath was the bearer of a written communication to
the Repubjran convention from the ColoneL He presented
this to the Republican members of the "olivo branch" com
mittee who immediately retired for consultation, asking
Chairman Harding in the meanwhile to delay calling the con
vention to order.
Eleven o'clock, the hour of convening, found the con
vention in disorder with no prospect of an immediate con
vening. None of the convention officers was present.
McGrath sat stolidly at the front of the platform, hix)
arms folded. His appearance was noted almost at once and
a buzz of excited speculation ensued.
On the floor it seemed as though every delegate was
present. They caucused in excited little groups Ohio par
ticularly. The Buckeye State, delegates said, would go
solid for the Supreme Court Justice.
Hitchcock, who appeared on the floor at 11:20 was
overwhelmed with congratulations, delegates from practi
cally every State making no concealment of their entire con
viction of Hughes' immediate nomination.
A -onference of the "olive branch" committee of Re
publicans and Progressives at 9 o'clock this morning was the
last effort to defeat Hughes. In the view of leaders it was
foredoomed to failure, just as the prolonged discussion of
last night had developed a deadlock the Progressives stand
ing pat on Roosevelt as the Bull Moose price of amalgama
tion, and the Republicans proffering in his stead any one of
a dozen favorite sons, dark horses and possibilities. Last
night's conference adjourned at 2:30 a. m., both sides
amiable but adamant.
The Hughes forces, it became known when the allies
got together, have been sounding out every one of the
favorite sons on the question of the Vice Presidency.
AUDITORIUM. CHICAGO. June 10
Colonel Roomvelt's telegram Indorsing
Senator Lodge as a compromise candi

vention today aa It was ready to nomi
