Eleven o'clock passed and the con

gates put in the time discussing possi
bilities 'down at the Auditorium and
reading news bulletins. The oyer night
switch of one of the favorite son's dele
gates filled the Hughes men with exul
tation and they came in early, confident
of nominating their man on the first
ballot.
Await Conference Report.
While the convention was assembling
John McGrath, Roosevelt's secretary,
arrived and talked with leaders. Not
many had arrived, however,.and Mc
Qrath waited. Senator Weeks, who
had released, hls .delegates, took a seat
on the platfbpm.

for Fairbanks had been released ex

Former Secretary of War Stimson at
the end of a New Tork caucus an
nounced that the delegation 'with pos
sibly a few exceptions would vote for
Hughes.
At 11:49 o'clock Chairman Harding
rapped for order and efforts were made
to get the convention quieted down.
Make It Unanimous.
As state after state voted solidly for
Hughes and others .changed to him it
became evident the' nomination was
practically unanimous.
As the roll call concluded the con
vention broke into, an uproar and a
demonstration was on,
A. P. (Moore, of Pennsylvania, was
recognized to make Hughes' nomination
unanimous.
Pleased With Nomina*.
Chairman C. D. Hilles, of the na
tional committee, saiil:
"Six months ago said the nominee
would be born in tne conventien and
he was."
Frank Hitchcock ^aid:

means a reunited republican party and
victory in November."
Senator Penrose Mid:
"I am too busy to-talk."
Frank H. Hitchcock* was'quoted as
saying the Hughes men wanted Bur

The demonstration for Hughes
quieted down after seventeen minutes.

Chicago, June 10.—A general break
ing up of the favorite sons-delegations
was evident today. .The general drift
was toward Justice Hughes.
Senator Sherman, of Illinois, re
leased his fifty-six delegates and it
was said that practically all would
vote for Hughes on the first ballot
today—the third of the convention.
Senator Weeks, who polled-106 del
egates, released big delegates, and
while the delegates stated they wanted
to stay with him to ^ie end it Is like
ly they wili go over to the justice.
Senator Weeks said ,he had informed
his supporters that while he greatly
appreciated their 'loyalty fie desired
now that t|ey cast their votes else
where.
Fairbanks supporters gave indica
tions of not prtjplrtff their fight
longer, and the Hughes Mtiiders. ex-,
pected to gain part of the Fairbanks
delegation.
No one undertook ,to .spp&k for

quite well understood they will not

Contest For Vice Presidency.
There is a peculiar contest on over
the vioe presidency. The two men
most prominently mentioned are Mr.
Fairbanks and Senator Borah, of
Idaho. Neither of the men wants the
position. The supporters of the lat
ter are for him because they believe
that his candidacy would Insure the
adhesion of a large percentage of the
progressive party and they are bring
ing strong pressure to bear on him.
It is believed that Mr. Fairbanks
would add great strength to the ticket
in the middle west and among the
conservative element thruout the
country.
Roosevelt to Support Hughes?
"The namfe of Hughes will be pre
sented to the "progressive convention
immediately," Senator Borah said as
he emerged from the peace conference
shortly before 11 o'clock. "No name for
second place has been considered as
yet."
Second place on the ticket was held
in abeyance because republican con
ferees felt this courtesy was due for
mer Vice President Fairbanks, who
had been consulted about accepting It
if he were not nominated for presi
dent.
Definite word that Colonel Roosevelt,
will support Hughes was brought her$
by George B. Cortelyou three days
ago.
HUGHES TO ISSUE STATEMENT.
Receives News of Nomination Without
Apparent Emotion.
Washington, June 10. Justice
Hughes was told of his nomi
nation by newspaper men .at his
home, where he had 'been at
work on a decision to be handed down
Monday, probably his last day as a
Justice of the Supreme court. He re
ceived the news without evident emo
tion, saying "I have nothing to say at
this time ,but will make a statement
later in the day."
Word of the nomination of Hughes
and Roosevelt in Chicago was com
municated immediately to President
Wilson.
The news came while Justice Hughes
was eating lunch with Mrs. Hughes and
their two daughters. Miss Katherine
and little Mlss Elizabeth.
"Now, gentlemen," said the justice
to the newspaper men, "all I know
about this -is what you tell me, but if
you are interested you may return at
3 o'clock, when I pro^ablj? will have a
statement for you."
Within fifteen minutes a telegram
came from Senator 'Harding., chairman
ot the convention, announclriJ- the nona*

nounced that there would be no busi-
a rep|y
which will be sent to Chicago
immediately.
When George W. WIckersham was
told of the nomination he said: "I pre
sume he will accept."
Roosevelt in Seclusion.
Oyster Bay, N. T., June 10.—When
informed that the republicans had nom
inated Justice Hughes and the pro
gressives had nominated him, Colonel
Roosevelt refused to make any com
ment. He remained secluded in his
home.
It is confidently believed here, how
ever, that Colonel Roosevelt will accept
the nomination. His friends looked for
a statement from him to this effect
later today.
FEAR ANTI-AMERICAN
UPRISING IN MEXICO
Reports Coming From South of Bor
der Cause Uneasiness in Adminis
tration Circles—Americans Hurry
ing Across Border.
Washington, June 10.—Administra
tion officials were uneasy today over
continued reports of anti-American
demonstrations In northern Mexico.
Americans are making their way to
the border in great numbers and those
seeking to return to Mexico are ad
vised not to do so.
Most demonstrations have gone no
further than mass meetings and
speeches by agitators, who resent the
presence of American troops on Mex
ican soil. Carranza troops have sought
to disperse such gatherings.
Officials fear Mexican public opinion
may flare into open rioting, altho no
fear is felt for the safety of 'General
Pershing's forces. In the states of
Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi and •Nueve
Leon, anti-American demonstrations
have been particularly numerous and
attacks on American property were re
ported from Chihuahua vid Monterey.

Sees No Hope For Agreement.
Colonel Roosevelt said he had been
notified that the peace conference at
Chicago had come to no conclusion
and that the republicans had again
asked for the suggestion of a name as
a candidate from the progressive con
ferees. He then told the progressive
conferees that he deeply approved
their loyalty to him and tneir efforts
to get him nominated, but that he
thought the time hud come, carrying
out the spirit of the progressive na
tional committee in January and the
statement made by him in Trinidad, in
February, it was their duty to present
an alternative name on which he
hoped the republicans and progressives
oould unite.

ROOSEVELT NAMED
Chicago, June 10.—'Col. Theodore
Roosevelt today was nominated by the
ntutional progressive convention for
the presidency of the United States.
Bainbridge Colby, of New York,
placed the name of Colonel Roosevelt
in nomination. His nominating speeOh
lasted less thafl two minutes. Dele
gates cheered wildly but the demon
stration was checked at once by the
chairman.
Governor Hiram Johnson, of Cali
fornia, seconded the nomination, nnd
asked for immediate action. The
nomination of Roosevelt was by ac
clamation.
Nominations Are Simultaneous.
At the very moment when it flashed
to the progressive con ven'Olon that
Hughes had been nominated as stand
ard bearer of the republipan party,
Chairman Robin® was announcing
That Colonel Roosevelt had been nomi
nated as the progressive leader. The
convention was iti a frenzy'ttnd' th^re
was no way to Inform the delefjtltes
what had occurred at the Coliseum.
The progressive convention ut 12:4-2
p. m., recessed till 3 o'clock this after
noon.
The progressive national convention
assembled at 10:30 a. m., with the
prospect tha-t Colonel Roosevelt would
be nominated almost Immediately.
After a peace meeting with the re
publican committee progressive lend
ers announced that the nomination
was almost inevitable unless the
colonel himselff forbids it.
State Chairman in Row.
The meeting of the state chairmen
was somewhat stormy. Several of the
chalrmem implied that Chairman
Perkins was not for Roosevelt to the
last trench. Miller, of Florida, nnd
Parker, of Louisiana, resented the
criticism. 'Mliller left the room but
was persuaded to return.
Mr. Perkins told the peace conferees
that even if Illinois went to Hushes
at the republican convention it would
be insufficient to nominate and that
he looked for a. recession from Hughes.
"The tide Willi turn to Hoosevelt, I
think," said Mr. Perkins.
It was understood that at the peace
meeting Senator Sm'oot had submitted
a proposal In writing. On submission
of the proposal. Mr. jerkins, Mr.
Bonaparte and John 'McGrath took a
copy of it to other progressive leaders.
The Smoot proposal involved only the
name of Hushes. It was eaiid. Feeling
was hopeful among republican lead
ers that the Smoot proposal would
prove acceptable.
"We want this convention to name
Roosevelt before the r«publicans eet
a chance," said Col. R. A. W ilkinson,
of Minnesota, as the progressive dele
gates slowly filled the Auditorium.
Demand Immediate Action,
As the delegates came into the con
vention hall from their meeting with
the pcace conferee?1, the delegation
chairmen were pounced upon by dele
gate« and got the word that Colonel
Roosevelt was to be instantly named
and by acclamation with only a for
mal vote for record purposes.
Then tihe leaders demanded that the
convention immediately convene. The
chairman ordered the stage cleared.
At 10:40 Chairman Robins began
pounding his gavel. There was a show
of haste to 'proceed to nominations be
fore the republican convention should
convene. W
About one-third of the delegates
were present when the convention
was called to crder at 10:41.
The chairman announced that the
convention qhould proceed deliberate
ly and In order and said the flrst busi
ness was a report from the conference
committee. Chester Rowell, of Cali
fornia, told of the conference of state
chairmen. Mr. Rowell requested that
the convention do not "take any ac
tion until their'orrivaj
"How soon will they be here?" dele
gates shouted. "We will wait a
reasonable time," said Chairman
Robins.
Mr. Perkins then read the reply of
the republican conferees to the pro
gressives, who said they would suggest
the name of Hughes to the progressive
convention.

copy had been sent to the republican
conferees. Colonel Rooseveit recites
how the republicans had asked for a
second choice from the progressives.
Colonel Rooseveit declared It was
Imperative to sink "all minor differ
ences and come-together If by any pos
sibility we can find a common standing
ground. The day before yesterday «n
my telegram to Senator Jackson, 1
said: "Can wo not get together?"
The telegram reiterated the "appeal"
to the progressive and republican con* I
ventions.
"I ask you to make those words
good by deeds," Colonel Roosevelt
said, "In view of the conditions I pre
sent the name of Senator Lodge, ot
Massachusetts."
Rejeot Colonel's Suggestion.
Loud cries of "No, no," came from
the floor and interrupted the reading
of the telegram. The delegates lis
tened in silence tot Mr. RooseveH's lav
dation to Seh&tor Lodge as a progres
sive leader.
At the conclusion of the reading
again loud cries of "No, no,? came
from'nil ^arts of the halL.
Discussing .the telegram-Mr. Perkins
said in working for a peace agree
ment he had been much criticized.
"I may have done well or poorly in
this but I certainly have tried to do
right."
The delegates cheered Mr. Perkins
loudly.
Mr. Perkins said:
"In common honor of fairness we
can not vote and place Mr. Roosevelt
in nomination at least until his com
munication is submitted to the othei
