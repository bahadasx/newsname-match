Can you imagine what happens when an orphan asylum
takes fire? Can you imagine the poor, little drudw of the
place—the little Cinderella whom everybody cuffed and
kicked, as tlie heroine of that lire?
And then Tjove came the young artist who lived near
by, and after that a tragedy. Poor Ann tired a pistol—but
you should seethe picture and learn how clone to the (iriin
Destroyer circumstantial evidence can briny an innocent
person. It is a great picture tears, comedy, tragedy, ro
mane«;, and happiness at last. A real Triangle Play.

Many are the thrilling and exciting scenes in this latest
Triangle Play, in which H. B. Warner as the young clerk de
feats the plans of the clever crooks to cheat his employer.
The fascinating stock-room scene at the time of the terrible

other quick moving moments keep on the time. You'll not
be sorry if you make it a point to see this picture.
And in addition there will be shown a Triangle Keystone

conferees appointed to,
bring republican and
progressive unity.
CIlMVIgO, ,f 11 im' S. Tin* lYo its
she party and the Republican
pavtv art 1 to be united tomorrow,
hi Ifss all signs fail. Despite a
frmzied opposition from tin« radi
cal members, George W. Perkins,
ll( osi-vrlt k Chicago manager. Iiad
Iiis own way and the Progressives,
late lodav, asked i I m « Republicans
to moo) a peace committee.
Tlie convention no t in two noisy
sessions and adjourned tonight
until 10 o'clock tomorrow.
The principal business of the
day was the approval of tlie
scheme to confer on peace with
tlie Republican convention.
Throughout the day the leaders
kept control over the delegations
more l>v persuasion, and hy eon
slant reiteration of ('hairinan
Robins' promise that the major
ity would decide any questions
that arose, than h v anv actral
hold they had upon the delcga
tioiis. The same determination to
nominate Theodore Roosevelt was
evident from the time the first
délégation trooped in shortly after
I o'clock until the last went out
shortly before 0 o'clock tonight.
Leaders made no effort to con
ceal their belief that a failure of
the conference committee to agree
or to find some possible basis for
an agreement eoubl result in but
one thing the immediate nomi
nation of Col. Roosevelt. In the
words of Chairman Robins: "To
morrow probably will he a big
day" in the convention.
Only bv many promises to place
no obstacle in the way of the nom
ination of Col. Roosevelt were the
delegates content to adjourn and
await results from the conferees.
Chairman Robins of the Pro
gressive convention tonight ap
pointed as members of the Pro
gressive conference , committee
*0«M*re« PsAins, Governor
Hiram Johnson of California,
Horace Wilkinson nnd John M.
Parker of Louisiana.
The Republicans, viewing with
little hope the outlook for choos
ing a winning candidate, seized
iinon the plan with enthusiasm.
They choose as their bargainers,
:|ic ennirst and wisest of the cam
pdign-Ts r.f the fhi Guard; Sen
"
ators Smoot and Borah, former
Senator Winthrop Murray Crane,
Nicholas Murray Butler, president
of Columbia University, and
former Representative A. R. John
son. of Ohio. The Republicans
then adjourned until tomorrow
morning.
The conference committees of
the Republican and Progressive
convention began discussion of
peace plans at 10:40 o'clock to
night and Senator Borah, one of
the Republican conferees, pre
dicted the session would last, at
least three hours.
This was the situation as epi
tomized by one of the conferees
after the conference had been in
session a little more than an hour:
Th utmost harmony had reigned
in the meeting.
Republicans were impressed
with the apparent, desire of the
Progressives to effect an agree
ment.
No name except that of Col.
Roosevelt, had heen mentioned.
Progressives, while showing a
decided preference for Col. Roos
evelt as the nominee, did not say
they would not support any other
man.
The name of Hughes had not
been mentioned.
Encouraged by the happv open
ing of the conference it was said
j there w as a possibility that the
I conferees would remain in session
most of the night or until they
had reached some tangible agree
ment. or complete disagreement.

let koch fill your
prescription,
forestry legislation' for
louisiana.
Efficiency in Mate forestry is
impossible without the direction
of a forester properly qualified
by education and practical ex
pefriencc. To secure and retain
the services of f | competent State
forester, the work must lie placed
in non political hands, and scp
a rated from the administration
of gaine and fish laus. This is
the universal experience of states
which have attempted to organize
Stute forestry departments.
Thirty States have forestry de
partments. Of these, twentv-four
have secured complete separation
of forestry from other State bus
and have constituted it a

unsatisfactory.
Six New Kugland States. These
States have done more to stimu
late private forestrf than any oth
e rseetion, and their progress is
directly due to separate forestry
organization in charge of well
trained foresters.
Six Southern States. The
States of Maryland, Virginia,
North Carolina, Kentucky, Ten
nesscc and Texas all hove estab
lished forestry departments sep
arate from fish and game protee
tion. and in charge of trained foi
esters. Kacli of these States is
doing commendable work in puî^
lie education and practical fores
try. The question of eroded lands
in western Tennessee is being
solved by measures advocated by
the State forester.
Louisiana and Alabama alone
of the Southern States have pro
ided the semblance of forestr\
without its substance, and in both
instances failure to employ a
Stale forester is responsible. In
both cases, the cause of this fail
ure is that forestry was combined
with fish and game protection,
and the latter interest crowded
it to the wall.
Of the Middle Northern States,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, M in

In

re in charge, and splendid prog
re*s has been made along all lines,
Indiana has accomplished ruifn
ing. and her failure is coincident
with the appointment o untrained
men or political purposes, as
State oresters.
New York, often rited as an
example of consolidation of for
estry with fish and game, has been
heavily handicapped by this ar
rangement and has secured cer

tain progress in State forestry
only by creating a separate s'ib
division of the forestry work, and
placing a trained forester in
charge.
