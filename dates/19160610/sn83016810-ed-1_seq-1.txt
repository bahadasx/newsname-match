BADLY NEED HELP.
Morgenthau Says Condition In
Turkish Empire Is Pathetic.
SIGHTS WOULD BRING TEARS.
Former Ambassador Declares if Amer
icans Could Only 8ee Distress as He
Had 8een It th Need of Aid Would
Be Fully RealizedSays Only Way to
Expreee Sympathy Is to Contribute.
New York.Former United States
Ambassador Henry Morgenthau In a
recent interview gave as one of the
main reasons for his resignation as
ambassador to Turkey his great desire
to make known to the people of the
United States some of the conditions
in the Turkish empire, especially as
they affect the long suffering Armeni
ans. He wants to assist in the raising
of funds for Armenian relief, to ex
plain the real conditions in Turkey
and to make known in a tactful way to
the Turkish authorities the thoughts
of the American public on the condi
tions In that land.
Referring to the tragic sufferings of
the Armenians and of the need of im
mediate help to save thousands of men,
women and children from dreadful
death by starvation, Mr. Morgenthau
made the following statement:
"In my childhood I cried over 'Uncle
Tom's Cabin,' and wept at the way
the negroes were sold into slavery.

HENBT MORGENTHAU.
Later on I read 'Evangeline,' and my
heart went out to the poor woman and
her lover, but all of these things are
nothing compared to what went on In
Turkey under my own eyes. I do not
want to give too many harrowing pic
tures, but I will say that I have been
requested to state that most of the
stories that have reached the United
States are founded on facts.
"The Armenians were living just as
quietly and peacefully as possible, In
friendship and close contact with their
Turkish associates, when suddenly
they were picked out to be deported.
It was then that my heart bled for
them. I had been given the privilege
of dispensing charity without stint and
with full authority on behalf of the
English, Russian, French and Italian
nationseven the Servians had sent me
money, and Russia and Italy permit
ted me to help the poor Montenegrins
in my charge. Suddenly, without avail
able funds, I was confronted with the
terrific problem of the destitute Ar
menians. Can you conceive how I felt?
It was then that I sent an appeal to the
secretary of state for help, and the re
sponse came promptly.
"If the people of the United States
could only see the distress as I have
seen it! If they could see the gaunt lit
tle figures of children, the little or
phans brought to Constantinople by
friendly Turkish officers, the need of
prompt aid would be fully realized. If
I dared repeat the tales I have heard,
sworn to and signed, they would make
men and women weep, and every one
would see the need of sympathy and
help.
"There is no use of accusing anybody
or finding fault with any one. What
this great country should do to show
its appreciation of the wonderful bless
ings that have been showered upon us
is for each one of us to make up bis
mind to do his share.
"We are the only people to whom
they can appeal for help today, the
only people who dare express their
sympathy by actual giving. The peo
ple of other nations are afraid and un
able to do it."
Mr. Morgenthau is a member of the
American committee for Armenian
and Syrian relief, of which Cardinal
Gibbons, Bishop Greer of the Episco
pal church, Dr. James L. Barton of the
American board of foreign missions,
Dr. Arthur J. Brown of the Presby
terian foreign mission board, Dr. Frank
Mason North of the Methodist foreign
mission board and other prominent
ministers and laymen, Protestant,
'Catholic and Jew, are members. The
committee has sent $600,000 to the Ar
menians and native Christians In Tur
key, Persia and Syria since Turkey
entered the war, and it is stated that
$5,000,000 win be required to save and
these peoples.

BURGLAR KEPT MONEY.
Woman's Last Word About Funds In
the Bank Brought Decision.
Kansas City, Mo.He was polite,
even suave, as he unlocked the door
and entered the room occupied by Mrs.
William Buchanan of 1516 Locust
fetreet the other day. He closed the
door so quietly and had such a gen
tlemanly manner that Mrs. Buchanan
was too much surprised to scream.
The intruder took her pocketbook, con
taining nearly $3, from the dresser.
Then Mrs. Buchanan protested.
"Please don't take my money. It is
all I have," she pleaded.
"But I understood you had lots of
money," replied he, holding the cash in
his hand. "But if this is all you have
I'll return it"
"But I have more than that," she in
sisted. "It's in the bank, but as I don't
feel very well goodness knows when I
shall be able to get more," she contin
ued. The intruder hesitated, smiled and
then took the money. Mrs. Buchanan
then called the police.
TOOK CLOTHES FOR DEBT.
Because He Couldn't Collect $3 He
Seized Four Suits.
Indianapolis. William Devine, a
farm laborer, explained in the criminal
court that, being unable to collect $3
from James Boyce, living near Flack
ville, he took four suits of clothes as
payment He admitted he was gen
erous to himself, for the suits were of
excellent quality and appearance.
"First I put on one suit," he said,
"and then I thought how much better
it looked on me than it did on Boyce,
so I took the others."
With the disappearance of his suits
and Devine, Boyce came before the
grand Jury and an indictment was re
turned against the farm laborer. Boyce
paid $18 to find and return Devine to
the city to face the larceny charge.
Devine went to Madison, Ind., after
taking the suits.
Judge Collins sentenced Devine to
the penal farm for ninety days.
v I'M SO FOND OF MUSIC!"
That Explains What Maid Does With
an Advance of Wages.
Chicago.For a few days a young
north shore matron believed she had
solved the servant girl problem. Her
first girl found the country life too
slow and returned home "back of the
yards."
This experience afforded an inspira
tion, and she imported a girl from her
former home at Galesburg. Kindly
treatment was to be the keynote of
success, so when she discovered the
new maid lacked underwear she armed
her with a dollar and shopping in
structions.
In thirty minutes the girl was back,
but minus the underwear. In its place
she had purchased a mouth organ
costing 49 cents, which she exhibited
proudly to her mistress with the re
mark:
"I'm so fond of music."
NEW USE FOR OLD GLORY.
In a Brooklyn Court It "Protects the
Bench."
New York.After an adjournment of
the Brooklyn court of special sessions
recently the bench and clerk's desk
were bedecked with an American flag.
"What's the idea?" Chief Probation
Officer John J. Rooney was asked.
"That's the duster," Rooney explain
ed. "When the Janitor sweeps he cov
ers the bench and clerk's desk with
the old flag."
Indignant, the questioner sought out
Chief Clerk Joseph L. Kerrigan and
demanded an explanation of the ap
parent desecration of Old Glory.
"Well, Isn't the flag protecting the
bench?" was Kerrigan's ready re
sponse.
GETS EGG DURING TRIAL.
Hen Labeled "Exhibit A" Lays It In
Court, and the Judge Benefits.
Portland, Ore.Maude, a White Leg
horn hen, was in District Judge Bell's
court as Exhibit A in a suit over her
ownership and that of two other Bid
dies and a cockerel. Suddenly there
smote the air a shrill "cut-a-cut" It
was Maude cackling, and she kept it
up. "Bailiff, kindly remove the ex
hibit," ordered the judge. The bailiff
approached Maude's coop. "Tour
honor," he shouted, "look!" and held
up a snowy white egg. "Maude has
laid it."
Both litigants agreed that the judge
should receive the egg, and he did.

MRS. EDISON RAPS
ABBREVIATED SKIRTS.
Hundreds Present When Inventor's
Wife Hits ClothingUrges Girls
to Be Modest.
New York.Hundreds of women re
cently heard well known women who
were delegates to the National Fed
eration of Women's Clubs convention
discuss dressthe right and wrong
kind of dress, the future dress and the
cost of dress. All the speakers ad
vocated greater individuality in dress.
Mrs. Thomas A. Edison made an ap
peal for greater modesty in dress, par
ticularly of young women, and in no
unmistakable terms assailed clothing
which, she said, tended to lead sons
down to degradation. She denounced
"the present abbreviated skirts and un
covered shoulders," saying: "I had a
father who frequently reminded me,
'Daughter, be modest.' I think this
would be good advice to our girls to-
day."
Her husband, Mrs. Edison said, had
declared there was not more than one
woman in a hundred who was well
dressed.
LITTLE TOWN IN OHIO
PLAINLY ON THE MAP
Clyde Has Several Claims to Dis
tinction In Connection With
Country's Wars.
Sandusky, O.The village of Clyde,
fourteen miles southwest of this city,
was the home not only of the highest
ranking officer killed during the civil
war, but also of the first American
killed in the Spanish-American war.
It has the distinction also of being the
nucleus of what is now the Women's
Relief corps. General J. B. McPher
son, killed at Atlanta in the civil war,
and George B. Mack, the first Ameri
can killed in the Spanish-American
war, are both buried there.
According to Joel Elliot of Clyde,
Mrs. Hattie McPherson, aunt of Gen
eral McPherson, organized the first
Ladies' Aid society after the civil war
began, and it was from the Ladles' Aid
society of the sixties that the Women's
Relief corps of the present day grew.
Elliot says further that army rec
ords at Washington will show that in
proportion td population, more men
enlisted at Clyde for both the civil and
Spanish-American wars than from any
other place of Its size in the United
States.
President Garfield was to have been
the principal orator at the unveiling
of the McPherson monument when,
on Saturday, July 2, 1881, he left the
White House to go to the seaside to
spend Sunday with his family before
proceeding to Ohio and was shot while
waiting for his train.
NEW WAY OF GETTING A SUIT
Prisoner Worried Owner Until He
Gave It to Him.
San Jose.A new way of getting a
suit of clothes was introduced here
when William Shore, a prisoner, con
fessed to Police Captain Campbell that
he had "mooched" the suit he wore.
"I saw the suit on a man on the
street and liked It," he said. "So I
went up to him and asked for it He
got mad and wouldn't give it to me, so
I followed him around day and night
for two days, asking for it at every
turn. Finally he got disgusted with
me and gave me the clothes."
Shore told Police Chief Fuller, who
threatened to put him to work pitch
ing hay, that he "wouldn't pitch enough
hay in a week to keep a canary bird
alive for one day."
REFUSED TO QUIT JAIL.
Muneie (Ind.) Resident Said It Was
the Best Job He Ever Had.
Muneie, Ind.Albert O'Harra, sheriff,
had a hard time to make Frank Mc
Laughlin quit the county jail.
A friend paid McLaughlin's fine, but
he steadfastly refused to leave the Jail
until his sentence had been served, the
sentence being for eleven days.
"I never had a better job than this,"
said McLaughlin. "All I had to do was
a little scrubbing out in the morning,
and I had a good, warm place In which
to sleep and a good place In which to
eat and had plenty of things to eat In
the bargain. Believe me, Sheriff O'Har
ra is the best landlord I've ever known."
CALICO FROM THE SKY.
Windstorm Drops Bolt of Goods In
Needy Woman's Yard.
Hume, Mo.In a recent windstorm
here a bolt of calico fell in Mrs. Jenny
Harrie's chicken lot in the north part
of the city. It was quite a lucky haul
for Mrs. Harrie, when the price of cali
co is considered, and she needed the
goods.
It is supposed that the calico was
taken up in the clouds in the path of
the tornado soutlTof here. Where it
came from no one knows.
Hog With Six Legs.

HAS ODD CAREER.
Woman at One Timej Headed Six
Living Generations.
HAD FIVE SONS IN CIVIL WAR.
While She Was Celebrating Her One
Hundred and Fourth Birthday It
Wae Figured Out That Venerable Old
Lady of Wiaeonsin Hap 185 Descend
ant*Is Rugged and Enjoys Life.
Prairie du Chien, Wis.Grandma
Shrake is in her one hundred and fifth
year,- for she celebrates her one hun
dred and fourth birthday anniversary
recently. She is a most remarkable
woman In several respects. With the
"aid of a cane she is able to get about
quite well, and she is always cheerful
and happy. Up to a year ago she was
able to read the newspapers, but her
eyesight has failed fast since that
time, and she is now able to recognize
people only when they get within a
few feet of her. She has a rugged con
stitution and is able to take care of
three square meals a day and enjoy
them.
At the birthday anniversary thirty
five of her relatives were present to
do honor to the event, an event that
is exceedingly rare.
While the circle were enjoying din
ner it was figured out that this vener
able old lady had 185 descendants liv
ing at the present time, as follows:
Three sons, of which Sylvester Ault,
aged eighty-three, of Oelwein, la., was
present at the celebration and who de
clares that he is still a young man
forty-six grandchildren, ninety-two
great-grandchildren, forty great-great
grandchildren and four great-great
great-grandcnildren.
Mrs. Shrake herself was the mother
of ten children, of which the three sons
are all that are living of the first gen
eration.
And what a wonderful family record
is Grandma Shrake'sthe head at one
time of six living generations, all fe
male, the only known instance of the
kind in the United States. Death has
removed only two of the links. The
six generations are: Mrs. Lydia
Shrake of Wyoming, Mrs. Margaret
Elder (deceased), Mrs. Rachel Goff (de-
ceased), Mrs. Mallssa Spaulding of
California, Mrs. Cora Galley of Cali
fornia, baby Agnes Gulle of Califor
nia. They all used to live at Wyalus
ing.
Grandma Lydia Thomas Ault-Shrake
was born in Connellsville, Fayette
county, Pa., and at the age of four
moved with her parents to Coshocton,
O., where at the age of eighteen she
married William Ault in May, 1832.
To them were born five childrenLou
isa, Sylvester, Margaret, Elias and
William. Two of these sons, Sylvester
and William Ault, served In the late
civil war, the former In the Fifteenth
Wisconsin and the latter In Company
A, Thirty-first Wisconsin. In Septem
ber, 1839, her husband died, and two
years later she married Jacob Shrake.
In 1844 they moved to Green county,
Wis., and in 1850 to Wyalusing, then
home ever since. To the last union
were born five childrenJacob, of Bag
ley Jane, David, Abner and George.
Three of these sons served in the civil
war, Jacob in Company A, Thirty-first
Wisconsin David in Company H, Wis
consin's Eagle regiment, and Abner in
Company C, Forty-eighth Wisconsin.
This makes five sons Grandma Shrake
sent to the front in the dark days of
the war, another remarkable thing
to her credit and showing her patriot
ism. Her second husband, Mr. Shrake,
who died in 1861, was also a soldier in
the war of 1812.
HOME AFTER 21 YEARS.
Kansan, Long Thought Lost at 8ea,
Ends His Roaming.
Pratt, Kan.Charles M. Short, who
has been mourned as dead by his moth
er, Mrs. M. A. Annett of St. Joseph,
Mo., has been found In this city and is
alive and well.
Short tells a peculiar story of a roam
ing life, which he has at last decided to
stop and go home to his mother. About
twenty-one years ago Short left his
home at Excelsior Springs, Mo., and
started out for himself. He went to
San Francisco, where he went on the
seas as a sailor. He never wrote his
mother, but a word to a cousin in Ne
braska gave the information that he
was a sailor on a certain boat. This
boat was reported sunk, and there was
no report of Short's name in the list of
imrvivors.
His mother then mourned him for
dead until recently a flash came over
the wire from the cousin in Nebraska
that Short had been found.

WORKS TO FREE HIM
Bride Hopes to Gain Pardon For
Her Husband, a "Lifer"First
Occurrence In Oklahoma.
McAlester, Okla.-"Love laughs at
prison bars" is an old saying that was
given practical demonstration at the
Oklahoma state penitentiary. Etta
Martin, a pretty young Spanish girl
from St. Louis, became the bride of
John Cieloha, Bohemian, who is serv
ing a life sentence for murder.
It is the first sentence on record
where a life term convict was permit
ted to marry and the third case of
marriage in which an Oklahoma pris
oner appeared as principal.
The first case was that of a trusty,
who married before marriage license
clerk or ofilciating minister knew of
his record. In the other case the cere
mony took place in the warden's office
but the bridegroom held a parole in
one hand.
The young bride of John Cieloha ex
pects to bring about the release of her
husband through pardon or parole.
"If he hadn't escaped from the peni
tentiary he would have stood a much
better chance," suggested a newspaper
man in talking with the newlyweds
shortly after their marriage.
"But If he hadn't escaped I wouldn't
have found him," was the quick reply
of the young wife.
The persistence with which she pur
sued her demand for marriage with a
convict leads one to believe that she'll
keep her word as to freeing him.
Cieloha was charged with being ac
cessory to the murder of David Con
way, an aged bridge keeper on the
Midland Valley railroad, near Musko
gee, seven years ago. Conway was
found beaten to death, presumably by
robbers.

tioned in dispatches.
Lieutenant Thaw's machine received
several bullets. One of these hit him
on the elbow, breaking the small bone.

ing, wondering whether he was within
the German lines until he was relieved
by seeing two French soldiers come
running up. He is now in Paris, where
he will stay until his arm is better.
The injury is not severe. He has al
ready been promoted to a full lieuten

Fokker is likely to assure his receiving
the honor.
