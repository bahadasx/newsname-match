President of Big State School Ttlla

Three distinguished educators, two
of Ilio-jt.Mivn-ljw, frolVPU tho
honorary "degree of doctor ot laws by
the University of Missouri at corai

Roscoo Pound of tho Harvard Law
school, President Jackson Water;) of

ington, D. C, chief of tho United
States soil survey, and chief geologist
for tho United States department of
agriculture, formerly head of the de
partment of geology at the Univer
sity of Missouri.
Dr. A. Ross Hill, president of tho
university, who delivered tho com
mencement address, said:
"A university exists to train stu
dents In the sciences and tbo arts,
rather than to teach stenography,
salesmanship and cooking. But where
over workaday needs are furthered by
hcientlflc teaching then tho two should
be joined. Culture Is a unlversltj'o
real object, nnd it the seniors who
have completed the course hero have
not obtained genuine cultuic then tho
university Is not doing Its work suc
cessfully." Dr. 11111 told of the forwaul strides
of the Institution, and said that every
graduate must remember that his uni
versity is judged by him, and that
he has not only his own good name
and reputation to uphold, but the rep
utation of his university la entrusted
to his keeping as well. This respon
sibility must bo met squarely anil
truly, Dr. Hill told the graduates, for
In this world results aro scrutinized
closely, and the efficiency of a school
is judged by the efficiency of its grad
uates. Confederate Veteran Dead.

TOBACCO Z
Then you'll find some
savory whiffs of fact in
this article Social history
of the "divine weed
.NY aro tho dreams which
wooers of l.ady Meotino
have seen floating tu tho gen
ial vapor which curls up
ward from their pipes and
cigars, says tho St. Louis Post-Dispatch;
but nono of them could havo
more fascination than tho quaint and
curious loro upon tho 'subject of tho
weed which has been compiled by an
English writer, G. L. Apperson, and
publiDhcd under tho inviting titlo of
"Tho Social History of Smoking."
Everyone knows that tobacco was
one of tho gifts of tho New World to
tho Old, and that Sir Walter Raleigh
mudo smoking fashionable In England
In the days of Queen Elizabeth. For
tho next CO years the smoking of pipes
not only becamo general among nil
clusscs, but a thing of highest fashion,
held In tho light of an art. In those
days it wnB not said that a man smoked
tobacco, but that ho "drank" or
"sucked" tobacco; and tho smoker
waa called a "tobacconist." Tho gal
lant of those days had no hesitation
about smoking in tho presence ot
women, and a character In Chapman's
play, "All Fools," praises himself as
different from others:
"And for dlscourso in my fair mis
tress' presence.
I did not, as your barren gnllants do,
Fill my discourses up drinking tobac
co." One of tho strangest things about
Shakespeare's works, says tho author,
Ib tho fact that nowhere does ho men
tion the word tobacco. Tho conclu
sion Is drawn that Shakespearo did
not smoke. Ills contemporaries, Spen
cer and Ben Jonson are different.
Spencer invoked the plant as "Sov
eralgno wecdo, dlvlno tobacco," and
from Jonson's comedies can bo gath
ered a perfect compendium of "to
bacco drinking" as ono of tho most
Important social phenomena of the
age. He reveals that a singular fea
ture ot tho enthusiasm for tobacco
In tho early yours of tho sovijntoenth
century was tho existence of "pro
fessors of tho art" of smoking.
Tho tobacco sellers wero mostly
apothecaries and some of these took
pupils nnd taught them tho "slights,
cs tricks with tho plpo were called,
Theso Included inhaling, nnd sending
out the sraoko In globes, rings, and so
forth. Shift, a professor of the art in
Jonson's "Every Man Out of Ills Hu
mor," puts up a bill In St. Paul's In
which ho offers to teach any young
gentleman nowly come Into his In
hcrltanco "to entertain tho most gen
tlemanllko uso of tobacco, ns first, to
give it tho most exquisite perfume;
then to know all tho dollcato sweet
forms for the assumption ot It; ob
also tho raro corollary and practlco of
tho Cuban ebolltlon, eurlpus and whiff,
which ho shall recolve, or tako In hero
nt London and ovnporato at Uxbrldge,
or farther, If It plcaso him:"
"Taking tho whiff," says tho author,
"may havo been clthor a swallowing
of the smoke, or a retaining it in tho
throat for a given space of time; but
whnt ho meant by 'Cuban ebolltlon'
or 'ouripus' is perhaps best left to
the Imagination."
If ono contemporary writer may bo
bollovcd, some of theso early Instruc
tors In smoking professed to ho ablo
1 to teach tho secret of omitting Bmoko
j not only frbm the noso but from tho
I eais; but a healthy skepticism Is per
mitted hero.
Thero Is a tradition that Queen
Elizabeth herself once smoked with
unpleasant results. Campbell, tn his
"History of Virginia," says that
Raleigh having offered her majesty
somo tobacco to smoke, "aftor two
or threo whiffs she was Bolzed with
nausea, upon observing which somo of
tho earl of Leicester's faction whlS'
pored that Sir Walter had certainly
I poisoned hor. But her majesty, In
short whilo recovering, mado tho coun
tess ot Nottingham and all her maldB
Bmoko n whole plpo out nmong them."
Tho qucon evidently had no dcslro
to monopolize tho novel sensation
caused by smoking. An old writer,
In a "Llfo of Ralolgh," snys that tobac
co "soon becamo of such vogue In
, Queen Ellznbeth'a court that some of
I tho great ladles, as well as noblemen
I therein would not scruple sometimes
I to tako a plpo very Boclnbly."
I Many royal ladles of our tlmo havo
1 had tho reputation of being conllrmed
smokers, says Apperson Among them
may ho mentioned Carmen Sylva,
dowager queen of Roumanin, tho Dow-
agcr Tzarlna of Russia, tho Into Era-
NICKNAMES
War nicknames aro a curious study.
Probably thero novor was a war which

press Elizabeth of Austria, King AI
phonso's mother, formerly queon re
gent of Spain; the Dowager Queen
Margherlta of Italy, and formor Queen
iVmclla of Portugal. It Is, of course.
well known that Austrian and Russian
women generally aro fond ot cigarette
smoking. On Russian railways It Is
not unusual to find a compartment la
beled: "For women who do not
smoke."
Queen Victoria, who detested tobac
co and banished It from her abodes
as far as sho could, onco received
a presont ot pipes and tobaccos. Sho
had sent to tho king of Dahomey a
basket tent, a silver pipe and two
silver trays. That dusky old reprobate
replied that he hoped the next gifts
would Include a carrlago and pair and
a while vtdman, both'-W which ho
would appreciate very much; but Bent
In return Bomo native pipes and to
bacco for the queen to smoke.
A curious feature ot tobacco man
nors among fashlonablo smokers of
tho Elizabethan period was tho prac
tice ot passing tho plpo from ono to
another, aftor the fashion ot a loving
cup. In a play of 1C14, one London
gallant says to another who Is smok
ing: "Please you to Impart your
tmoko?" "Very willingly, sir," says
tho smoker. Number two takes a
whiff or so and courteously says: "In
good faith, a plpo of excellent vapor!"
The rich young swell carried about
with him an elaborate tobacco ap
paratus, often of gold or silver. It In
cluded a tobacco box, tongs with
which to lift a live coal to light bis
pipe, a ladlo "for tho cold snulllo Into
tho nosthrlll," a priming Iron and as
large a collection ot pipes as his
means could afford and his pockets
could find room for. Sometlmos the
tobacco box was of ivory, and oc
casionally a looking glass was set In
tho lid, so that when tho beau opened
it to take out tobacco, he could also
havo a view of his delectnblo person.
However, tobacco had many ene
mies, and of theso tho most Influential
was Queen Elizabeth's successor,
James I, author of tho famous "Coun
terblasts to Tobacco." Ono ot his
most restrained denunciations of "to
bacco drinking" was this: "A cus
tom loathsomo to the eyo, hatoful to
tho nose, harmful to tho brain, danger
ous to tho lungs, and In tho blacko
stinking fumo thereof, nearest resem
bling tho horrible Stlglan smoko of
tho pit that 1b bottomlesse."
Through tho royal oxamplo of James
and of lils sou, Charles I, smoking
gradually sank Into n deellno insofar
as it was a fashionable practice, which
continued until well Into tho last cen
tury. Thcnco arose tho curious fact
that tho pleasuro-lovlng cavaliers wero
not smokers, whilo tho Puritans, sour
as was their hatred of nearly every
Joy, wero mighty "drinkers of the
weed." Tho finds of plpes'on the sites
of tho camps of tho parliamentary
armies havo been numerous. It Is not
known whether Cromwell smoked; but
Milton smoked a plpo at 0 p. m. ovory
day before retiring. However, In somo
cases the Puritans contrived to Intro
duce their religion ovon Into pipe-
smoking, for an old chronicler tells
1 of a Presbyterian minister so precise
1 that "ho would not fo much ns tako a
plpo ot tobacco beforo that ho had
I first sayed grnco over It."
OF THE WAR
On moro obvious grounds wo have
been known slnco tho days of Joan
ot Arc as "godlams," the one epithet
to which our gallant allies have re
mained faithful throughout tho cen
turies.. We on our sldo havo chlotly
oxcrclscd our wit on tho supposed
passion of all Frenchmen for frogs.
Tho nature of a war, Indeed, can gen
erally bo traced In war nicknames.

But tho Puritan colonists In New
England wero moro strict Tho fa
mous Connecticut "Blue Laws" for
bade anyono under the ago of twenty
one to smoko, and no ono of any age
could smoko without a llconso from
tho court and a physician's certificate
that tobaceo would bo useful for him.
Under tho restoration smoking be
came unfashionable, tho pipe being
ousted from the stylish world by the
snuff box, although It still continued
universally popular among humbler
folk. Smoking was regarded as "low"
or provincial until well Into the reign
of Queen Victoria. When the prlnco
regent died In 1830, he left not a cel
lar ot wlno but a "cellar ot snuff,
which was Bold to a tobacconist for

lection ot snuffs nnd. snuff boxe3, and
was fastidious In his choice ot a box
to carry. Once when a light Sevres
snuff box which Lord Petersham was
using, was admired, the noble owner
replied, with a gentle lisp: "Yes, It
Is a nice summer box but would cer
tainly bo Inappropriate for winter
wear."
The rovlvnl of smoking in tho fash
lonablo world, where tobacco had so
long been In bad odor except tn tho
form of snuff, was due to the Intro
duction of tho cigar, imported Into
England from Spain and the Spanish
colonies. British officers possibly
brought the clsar back with them from
tho peninsular wars. Only a few Qt
tho daring persona ventured to adopt'
tho cigar at first, and between 1824
and 3,830 thero was only a wretched
smoking room at tho Athenaeum club
In London, Doctor Hawtree, on behalt
of tho house committee, announcing
that "no gentleman smokes." To add
further odious touch to his hideous
dwarf, Qulllp, Dickens mado him a
cigar smoker; Lord Rawdon, In "Van
ity Fair," was significantly a smoker
of cigars.
Howover, In tho bohemlan set, In
cluding authors and poets, smoking
was common. Carlylo was a groat
smoker, and the story la familiar that
one evening ho and Tennyson sat for
hours In solemn silence smoking their
pipes, ono on each sldo of tho fire
place; and that, ns tho visitor aroso
to go, Carlylo, bidding htm good-night,
said: "Man, Alfred, wo hao had a
graund nlcht; come again soon." In
tho course of n trip to Italy with
friends, Tennyson found ho could not
obtain his favorite brand of tobacco,
packed up his portraantoau and re
turned homo, breaking up the party.
Charles Lamb remarked that ho hoped
his last breath would bo Inhaled
through a pipe and exhaled in a pun.
Tho cigar was aided In reviving tho
habit by tho Introduction ot tho first
wooden plpos In England In I860, and
tho first cigarettes In about 1860.
These seem astonishingly recent
dates, but the author vouches for both.
The word "briar" haB no connection
with the prickly thorny briar ot Eng
land, but Is derived from tho French
term, "bruyere," meaning tho white
heath plant from tho roots of which
tho pipes aro made.
Laurence Ollphant, a man both of
letters and fashion, Is generally cred
ited with having first Introduced clg
arottes Into English society. They
became fashlonablo In about 1870, and
had a revolutionary effect on smoking
among women. Those ot tho lower
classes hud frequently boon pipe
smokers, but In society tho ladles,
perhaps for physical roasons, never
took up either pipe or cigar to any ex
tent. Tho cigarettes offered them a,
milder and moro delicato means ot
sharing man's delight In the weed
"In the twontloth century," the
nuthor says, "tobacco Is'once moro tri
umphant. The cycle of 300 yoars Is
complete, Since tho early dorados ot
the sevontoonth century, smoking has
never been so smllod upon by fashion
as it is at tho present tlmo."
Thero Is nothing opprobrious In
"Ruskl," and something positively ca
ressing In "fuzzy-wuzzy," tho English
nickname tor the bravo but misguided
Soudanese "Guppy" suggests good
natured contempt. Tho Boer "roolnek''
and "Drodrlck" aro familiar, but not
Insulting. London Tit-Bits.
Nugget of Truth.
It la much easier for a bad man to
live down to his reputation than It lt
tor a good man to live up to hU
well as more usual.
