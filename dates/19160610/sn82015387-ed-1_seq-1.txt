SA.tion the Result of Failure

SIDERED JUNE 21ST
Police Jury is Requested to
Notify Contractors as to
Condition of Culverts.
The town council met in regular
assion last Tuesday night. Present
were Mayor W. E. Davis, presiding,
secretary Jas. Hutchinson and Coun
ilinen Jno. L. Smith, James Band
A. Hartman and A. Depre. Absent:
C. B. Wills.
SIMuch routine business was trans
acted. The town marshal reported
all except two licenses paid. Mr. L
Dash applied for a half. year license
to sell whisky, etc.
As there were no bids received t
do the sea wall work, the council de
cided that the town itself would
filish the sea wall, and asked for
prices, propositions and conditions
under which the. proponents would
drive the piling and place the cap
ping, under the supervision of the
council. These propositions will
considered and acted 'on at a special
meetint' of the council on Wednes
day, June 21, next, at 1 p. m., at
the town hall. The filling in to b<
taken up at a later date.
The above-action seems to be gen
erally approved.
.It was also decided to grade, ditch
sad shell the Lewisburg road from
Coffee- street to the Poitevent &
Favre mill, an. improvement that is
sorely needed.
It was also decided to request the
police jury to notify the contractors
of the Mandeville-Slidell road to so
arrange the ditches and culverts as
to prevent the water from running
through. and flooding the streets of
tMandevllle, which could be 'easily
done by directing-the water to Little
Bayou Castaign.

If the work of the State Board of
Health, in examining the various
waters of the Florida Parishes,
should result in the declaration that
the water in Covington, and in St.
Tammany parish generally, is of re
I markable high purity, the Board of

Dr. Oscar Dowling, president of the

is fitted out for the purpose of mak
ing this survey. He took samples of
quite a number of wells, deep: and
shallow, and these samples will be
duly tested and analyzed.
This is the kind of work that has
made Dr. Dowling so valuable to the
State. His statements are based on
facts and are accepted withoet ques
