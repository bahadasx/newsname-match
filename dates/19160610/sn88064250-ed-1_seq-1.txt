'uGGESTS FIRE HALL AS
SUITABLE FOR OFFICIALS
AMarmen Fields of the Opinion that
Muok & Ladder Hall Would
Make Ideal City Hall
Alderman Marius Fields is of the ,
,plnion that the Hope, Hook & Lad
Company's hall, on Union and
lleevue streets, would make an
I city hall for the present.. Mr.
thinks that the building
Sbe artistically arranged, so
to afford commodious and com
le quarters for the city of
.'he fire hall, as the Hook & Lad
h.all is known, is centrally lo
led and is in splendid shape; ac
ng to Mr. Fields' views it
uld not take very much money
Aix up the building so as to
e it a city hall.
IBy occupying the same buildings
~th the fire company, it is figured,
t Opelousas will save enough
ey each year from rent as to
, e the fire company on a surer
d safer basis.
The question of the city hall wias
rached at the recent meeting of
i city council and it was decided
t to take action on any of the
oposition offered by some of t'he
eitzen property-owners.
Mr. Fields will no doubt meet
ith considerable support, as he
Wll present his case so logically as
force recognition. On account of
tbe large sum of money which will
e saved annually, by doing away
b the rent, the Fields proposi
i . is due thorough investigation
discussion.
SThe first ward member believes
at the city and fire company au
.thorities should work on a more
perative basis; *he is willing
the city to aid as much as possi
ble the fire boys, and believes that
b bringing them in closer contact
more material benefits will be de
.-ed by both bodies.

LAZARO SUBMITS HIS
RECORD TO VOTERS
SEVENTH DISTRICT REPRESENT ATIVE RENDERS COMPLETE AC
COUNT OF HIS STEWARD SHIP AND ANNOUNCES
FOR RE- ELECTION
Congressman Ladislas Lazaro in
makes his official announcement as fic
a candidate for re-election and at to
the same time submits his stand on sat
every important measure that has SP(
come up and is about to come up nee
before congress. Mr. Lazaro thinks th(
that his record is fully able to fal
speak for itself and for that rea- dig
son did not hesitate to submit it to tic
his constituents for consideration. 1
In a letter to the editor of this en]
paper Dr. Lazaro fails to say when it
he will be there to begin campaign- m3
ing in earnest In all probabilities sei
he will remain at his post of duty. cu
in Washington until the adjourn- i
ment of the present session of con- ou
gress. It was thought by local
friends of the seventh district con- fo
gressman that Dr. Lazaro would a
make a flying trip to Louisiana th
while the national democratic con
vention would be taking place.
Dr. Lazaro's friends are paving fo
the way for his campaign; they ly
feel confident that St. Landry will j,
return a majority in favor of their ca
candidate and it is expected by ea
them that he will lead the field by w,
a good margin in the first primary. c.
Friends of T. A. Edwards claim that pe
the race will be close between the se
present incumbent. and the Calca
sieu district attorney, while the
Barbee supporters are practically Se
certain that the final run off will on
be between the younthful Calca- ,
sieu district judge and the St. Lan- th
dry physician. at
It is expected, however, that Dr. ta
Lazaro will be here plenty of time Ti
to start the campaign; he knows ac
how to work the district and he is si
pretty apt to be kept busy for a re
few weeks, .at the least, re-build- I
ing his fences. c
The following is the interesting c(
statement of Dr. Lazaro, as sent to th
this office for publication: nm

gressional District of the State of 0

COMMITTEE IS APPOINTED S
FOR AUTO TRUCK PURCHASE
s Opinion Prevails That City Will Fn- D
e nally Appropriate Fubds for
Needed Improvements
At the regular meeting of the v
city council on last Tuesday night S
a committee from the fire depart
ment waited on the city officials
and pleaded with them for an ap- it
propriation for the proposed au- to
e tomobile fire truck. The muni
cipal lawmakers treated the fire
men cordially and left the impres- p
r. sion that at "some future date the o
g proposition will be favorably acted t
0 upon.
Mayor Loeb appointed a commit
tee of three composed of Aldermen i
I- Fields, Gosselin 'and Hollier, to in
- vestigate the matter and look into I
the propositions of the automobile
Scoicerns who are willing to offer
to reasonable terms to the city. This
committee will also meet a commit
ss tee from the fire departmen~t and
d, the whole subject matter will be
;h thoroughly discussed.
to It is very probable that the city
ar council will appropriate the neces
sary funds for the purchase of this
as auto truck, as the aldermen all ex
of pressed a desire to see the fire de
Id partment put oh a safer and more
ie progressive basis.
re The proposition has aroused the
interest of a number of influential
et citizens and as it is thought that a
e truck can be secured for very rea
as sonable terms it is very likely that
of the fireboys will be given the money
ill to buy the truck they have long
ay been fighting for.

In asking the people of the Sev- ter

it my duty to give a brief report of Hu
my work since the beginning of my Cal
service in Congress. I will not dis- pal

Lion to Congress, as that was thor- in
oughly discussed when I left the Bk
State Senate to become a candidate b
for Congress, and was approved by ne
a large majority of the voters of hol
the District. I have adhered to the ten
platform on which I was elected. Kn
I have always tried to study im- wa

for consideiation and voted strict- ed

judgment and my conscience after re(
carefully weighing the merits of qu

THE TARIFF tat
I had promised the people of t'ie fr
Seventh District to stand for a duty Lo
on rice, lumber and sugar, and
worked and voted accordingly when ge
the Tariff Bill was under consider- NE

Tariff Bill, and this Congress has
admitted the correctness of our po- ci
sition on sugar by enacting a law tl
retaining the present duty on sugar. in
I am supporting the present bill to m
create a Tariff Commission, to be
composed of experts to investigate
the whole tariff question from a
non-partisan, economic and scien- bI
tific standpoint, and to report ý to

city has existed the cathedral has le,
been the center of all religious,

temporary organization by the tar;

No sooner than Mr. St. Cyr had nat

H. D. Larcade, first of the new tice

DAY ON JUNE THE 14th
Some years past, a Grand Lodge it
of Elks concluded that American
patriotism was on the wane. In
order that the'Elks (an intenselyI

may do their part towards keeping U
the fires of patriotism burning, in
augurated "Flag Day." Since then s
some 1333 Lodges, scattered di
throughout America and her pos
sessions, celebrate the birth of our bi
r Flag, every 14th of June, with ap
propriate exercises, interspersed o:
with patriotic addresses, songs and h
recitations. ii
1 The preparedness idea that is
sweeping over our country, seems fi
r to have stimulated the local Lodge ti
of Elks to arrange a program, this p
14th of June, far in excess of any o
thing yet attempted. Their plans t4
m not yet complete and subject to t
h some slight changes are about as (
follows:
Grand parade to leave Elk
" grounds at 8 o'clock P. M., headed
by Opelousas Brass Band, followed
by Boy Scouts bearing flag staff

he will make one of the best presi- an
dents in the history-of the St. Lan

native of this city, being the son of
the late Alfred Pavy, for many
years a power in St. Landry poli- Or]

Mr. Catlett, when the time came
to nominate the clerk and secre

impressive address in favor of J. J. oc

Mr. Healey was undoubtedly the pa
best qualified clerk of the police ist
jury St. Landry. has ever had, ha
claiming that Mr. Healey was so sp:
well versed in the affairs of the fie

Boy Interview Man With Dr. La

The mystery surrounding Dr.
Moise Lafleur's death, as far as hiis
local friends were cencerned, has
been partly cleared, as the result of.
an interview between the brothers
of the deceased and J. H. Molley,
who was at the head of the scien
tific expedition, of which Dr. La
fleur was physician.
The interview took place in New
Orleans this past week. Dr. Er
temon and Emare Lafleur having
gone there to ascertain all facts
concerning their brother's death.
On the morning of April 17, just
one month before the terrible trag
edy, Dr. Moise Lafleur, a Mr. Car
penter, Mr. Molley and two negro
servants left Balise, British Hondu
ras, in the direction of El Caye.o
which they reached three days
later; the expedition's objective
point was a newly reported archaui
ological site, nine days' journey,`
from El Cayo into the Peten bush.,
On April 26th the "expeditionary
party ascertained that revolution
ists had organized in El Cayo and
had captured nearby villages.. Do
spitethe danger they faced Dr. La
fleur and his friends decided to
proceed ahead, which they did- as,
soon as they could be provided
with necessary outfit, guides, mules
and supplies.
The party encountered friends
who joined them, so that in case of
trouble they would be 18 instead of
9. They could then overcome any
picket of the revolutionists. The
party reached Holmul, a little vil
lage near their destiny, on May tOth,
departing from there at 7:30 next
morning.
After leaving Holmul the. forest
were so thick that Dr. Lafleur and.
his party decided to go togethe:
w h ile th eir frien d s w o u ld g o h alve.
er way. After over half
Stravel they were. in the ti -
part of the forests, forty .m iKi
I away from the village of H.o.nra
on account of the density of the
woods and briars the party wi. '
forced to go single file, the gus.d
leading.
All of a sudden the party reached: .iz
a place, in the middle of the forest,"
I which had been cleaned out, NO
sooxer however than the party
reached this spot when shots were . .
heard, and the smoke obstructed
the view and no one could be seen.
- Mr. Molley yelled for Dr. Lafleur:
and the guides to come baibk, int9
the thickets, they being the only
ones not in sight, but not a word
was heard from them, nor coild
