Delegates Shout for Hiram Johnson for Vice President
Recess Taken Before Decision is Made—To
Communicate With Roosevelt
Chicago, June 10.—The Progressive Republican con
vention nominated Theodore Roosevelt as its candidate
for the presidency. The vote was by acclamation*.
After nominating Roosevelt by acclamation, the pro
gressives adjourned at 12:42 until 3 o'clock.
At the very moment when it was flashed .to the pro
gressive convention, that Hughes was nominated by the
republicans, Chairman Robins was announcing that Roose
velt had been nominated by acclamation.
The convention went wild, drowning out the shouts
of what transpired at the Coliseum. For several minutes
Robins vainly rapped for order.
Recess then was asked and taken after singing one
verse of "America."
Before recess was taken Robins had mentioned the
necessity of nominating a vice president.
"Hiram Johnson is the man," came the shout, show
ing a desire almost unanimous for the 1912 standard bear
ers. Johnson said he would communicate with Roosevelt

be received by newspaper, men. He
said he would have something to say
to them later.
"Now, gentlemen," said he, after
thanking them for their congratula

Early Reports of Switch.
Chicago, 111-, June 10.—The report
that the Republican delegates in

candidacies will break to Hughes
when the balloting begins was the
first sensation of today. The report
generally was credited. Combination
conferences continued practically all
night without reaching an agreement.
It was said the Illinois delegation in

It was a red-eyed, weary throng of

Apprehension was apparent on all
