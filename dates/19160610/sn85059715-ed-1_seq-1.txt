CHICAGO. June 10. At o'clock,
thin morning George W Perk inn.
Hiram Johnson and othrr Progressive
leaders were in close conference with
Chairman Bobbins and there wer*
rumorB among the Progressive dolegatcH
that a coup of some kind was in
preparation, the word having gone
round to have them in their seat*
early so that the convontion could
meet sharp at 10:30.
Goorge \V. Perkins left the confer
cnco to go to/a meeting of the Republican
and Progressive conferees. All
the state chairmen remained in the
conference. It was said no word had
yet come from Colonel Roosevelt as
to whether ho would accept a Progressive
nomination If the Republican con
ventlon nominated Justice Hughes.
Chairman Perkins was recognized
nt 1111 a. m. to report the action of
the conference committee.
The decision of the convention. Mr.
Perkins added, was of vital Import fo
the country.
A long telegram received this
morning from Col. Roosevelt to the
Progp'.-e-ive conferees was then road
by S?- rotary Davis, who said a copy
hud been sent to the Republican coti-'
f ernes.
Col. Roosevelt recited how the Republicans
had asked for a second
choice selection from the Progressives.
"For months I have thought of this
mntter," Col. Roosevelt Raid declar
Ing it was imperative to sink "all
minor differences" and reach a coin
mon ground if possible. He recited
the telegram sent to former Senator
Jackson. ____
The telegram reiterated tho "ap^
peal" to the Progressive and Republican
conventions
"I ask you. members of the Progressive
convention, to make those
words good by deeds," Colonel Roose*Telt
said.
Chairman Perkins was greeted
with a demonstration when he said:
"I may have done well, or may have
done poorly" in the conference. His
statement that Colonel Roosevelt
. ' .:> he acting well or unwisely was
received in silence.
Governor Johnson did not come to
the platform with the other conferees.
When Mr. Perkins concluded by
urging the convention to abide by
Colonel Roosevelt's request and defer
action tinti 1 the other convention
passed on the .suggestion of Senator
|j Lodge as n compromise candidate
the delegates acquiesced with shouts
of "that's right."
Captain John M. Parker, of Now
Orleans, addressed the convention In
behalf of those who "had burned the
bridges behind them" when thev.
Joined the Progressive party foilr
years ago. He opposed any compromise
that would sidetrack Colonel
Roosevelt. His every sentence was'
cheered.
"This is a permarent party."
shouted Parker. Similar sentiments
were expressed by him at the state
I WEEKS DE
ARE ALL
?
But Massachusetts Delegates
Declare They Will Stay with
Him to the Last.
<av AttOCIATtO * ? >
CHICAGO, June 10?SenPtor
Weeks, of Massachusetts, released
his delegates. In the balloting yesterday
Weeks had 105 votes.
The announcement of Senator
Weeks's withdrawal followed closely
on the news that Sherman had released
his delegates. The decision
of the Weeks and Sherman leaders to
Intmndnn tf'olr Candida tea. and in tim
case of Illinois to support Justice
Hughes, becamo known early and
bad a potential inlluoucc in deciding
the course of followers of other favorite
son candidates.
Senator Weeks announced that he
no longer continued the fight and
when pressed for a statement said
simply he had informed his suportera
that while he greatly appreciated
their loyalty lie desired now that they
cast their vote for some other candidate.
A large part of the Massachusetts
delegates indicated they
would stay with Weeks until the end.
but It Is understood his supportors
from other states generally will be
for Justice Hughes.
No one would undertake to speak
specifically for Falrbanks's follow-1
ers but It Is quite well understood
that they would not longer press his
candidacy.
Involved In this case Is the ques-i
tion of the vice presidency and even!
i the senatorial race In Indiana. Two
senators are to be elected In that
state this year and in whatever the
Indiana delegation does It will have
regard to this fact. The leaders
therefore, are anxious that the forjaer
vice president should be again

fighting was in progress on the Ver u

Avocourt. Thiaumont and the Chap ?

no infantry attacks. *

asked to allow his name to be used .
ior this ollice. believinp that with
hltn on 1h?? nntional ticket the elcc-. .
tlon of two Republican senators from
the Hoosier state would be practically
injured. At last ncounta they had (
received nothinp from him or hia
closest friends Indlcatinp that he
would accept the nomination for sec. c
ond place \
"Under the circumstances we have c
just pot to have him and we'll make e
him take It." said one of the Indiana ?
delegates.
Senator Burtons adherents are s
determined to po down with bannera
flying. a
Leaders were alow In pottinp out 1
thla morning but the men holding 8
secondary positions expressed thia ?s
opinion with decision They deelnre r
that Ohio is not .*a*lly influenced by

nothing la to be gained by a change w
at this time. f
Before the tlm* set for the Re- 1
publican convention It aoeinod probable
that moat of the New York dele- v
gates who have cast their votes for v
Senator Root will continue their al-. h
legiance to the end. The Sherman 1 C
following Is expected to go almost
solidly to Hughes and most of the t
Cuintuins delegates. especially out- ' V
side of Iowa, will follow in this di- t

There is a peculiar contest over v
