mittee of conference consisted of
Messrs. Perkins of New York, John
son of California, Bonaparte of Mary
land, Wilkinson of New York and
Parker of Louisiana.
Conference Frank.
The conference was frank, free and
most friendly. The conferees were of
£*, en6 mind in believing that the good of
the country and perhaps its repute
and influence for years to come de
pends upon the complete defeat of the
present democratic administration and
gH.' the restoration of the control of exe
cutive and legislative branches of the

by the republican and progressive par
ties alike.
The progressive conferees were
unanimous in urging with temperate
ness and fairness the opinion that
'V Thepdore Roosevelt of New York had
so large a personal following and such
a close personal relation to the Issues
of the coming campaign as to make
I", him the most desirable candidate upon
fe which to unite.
It was agreed that your conferees
would report these facts to this con

Recess for Lunch
COMMITTEES WATCH
PEACE SITUATION
Senator Borah Makes Call
and Advocates Union as
Best for Country
Auditorium, June 9. —Insistent
demands were made upon progres
sive leaders by some of the "rad
ical" element duHng the recess
that the progreesive convention
nominate Col. Roosevelt before
8enator Fall nominated him in the
republican convention. It was In
sisted that such a move would add
strength to Pall's remarks.
"I think the colonel will be nom
inated in the republican conven
tion first," Secretary McQrath
said.
Auditorium hall, June 9-—After fin
ishing consideration of their platform,
section by section, but without voting
for its final adoption, the progressive
convention recessed for lunch at 1:0ft
until 3 p. m.
The conference committees are un
derstood to be watching the situation
to determine whether there is any use
to try again to get together. Th|s de
pended, it was said, on whether the
republicans went on with nomina
tions or desired further parleys.
The visit of Senator Borah was. .paid
by Str. Perkins to be "another sign
of the friendly spirit between the two
conventions."
Mr. Perkins said he could not know
what significance could be attached
to the senators visit Some leaders
suggested that Borah might be the
compromise nominee suggested by the
republicans.
"Anyway w« are making a record
for ourselves that will set us right be
fore the country.
"No matter what the outcome,
we've got 'em anyway," Perkins said.
Borah Makes Visit.
Without any preliminary announce
ment, Senator William E. Borah enter
ed the Auditorium hall this afternoon,
where' the progressives were as
sembled in convention. He was es
corted to the platform. A tremendous
ovation was given him.
Chairman Robins introduced Senator
Borah and the convention roared it
self hoarse when the senator said he
had not come officially.
'It Is well known, the deep seated
affection I have for your leader," he
said, and was halted by another salvo
of enthusiasm, the whole convention
in a mighty chant, shouting, "We want
Teddy," for a full minute, while Borah
smilingly waited. The shouting lulled
and then was renewed, leaders jn
the stage joining.
"There's no doubt you want Teddy,"
said Senator Borah.
"We want Borah, too," answered the
delegates, and the Senator proceeded.
He put a quietus on the whispered
circulation of his name as a possible
"Moses" by reminding the progressive
convention that he was present as a
member of a committe from "another
convention."
"There isn't doubt but that you want
Teddy and that millions of citizens
throughout the country also want Ted
dy," he began. "You are fortunate in
having a leader," he continued, "who
has done more than any other man to
make the issues of this campaign.
Conventions Important.
"But let us bear in mind what
these two conventions do here will per
haps decide the welfare of the United
States for the next quarter of a cen
tury. We can only insure ourselves by
working together in close co-opera
tion. I do not discourage your loyalty
and enthusiasm to your leader, but I
must say it is essential that before we
leave this great city it should be defi
nitely determined that we will march
and fight together in this great con
flict.
'But if the two convention agree
upon your great leader you will find
no more enthusiastic supporters than
myself."
Borah concluded, amid applause and
shouts of "Roosevelt and Borah."
As Borah shook hands with the
leaders on the stage and left, the floor
hummed with excited discussion of his
dramatic visit.
Present Platform Report.
Before adjournment yesterday the
platform report was placed before the
convention by Dean William Draper
Lewis of the University of Pennsyl
vania, chairman of the resolutions
committee, and it was made the un

IOWA DELEGATION
WONDERING WHIT
IT IS GOING TO 00
IF IT IS DEMONSTRATED THAT
CUMMINS HAS NO CHANCE
WHAT THEN?
[BY R. D. MACMANUS.]
Chicago, June 9. —"What is the
Iowa delegation going to do in case it
is demonstrated that Cummins has no
chance?" That was the topic of con
versation among Iowans at the head
quarters in the Congress hotel last
night. There was a tendency among
some of them to get into the band
wagon when it appears on the scene
but none of them were out advocating
such a course openly.' That might
smack of disloyalty, they fear and yet
they do not want to feel that they had
no part in electing a nominee. So they
are up against it and a caucus was call
ed last night at which, it was rumored,
the matter was to be threshed out.
The Missouri delegation went into
executive session laBt night on much
the same grounds. The Missouri votes
apparently, are divided among Weeks,
Hughes and Fairbanks. Numerous ef
forts have been made to Impress upon
the delegation, the Importance of act
ing in unison and so the subject was
taken up in executive session. Several
of the delegates left the session with
the belief that when the time comes,
Missouri will come pretty close to be
ing a unit tor any big man Who ap
pears most iikely to be acceptable to
the convention.
Prenoh Heads Delegation.
W. T. Harper of Ottumwa, who
vice president of the Iowa delegation,
was acting head of it when Senator
Kenyon was suddenly called home, has
turned over the duties of the position
to Col. George W. French of Daven
port. The latter will act as chairman
during the remainder of the conven
tion.
Cheers Come Too 8oon.
Iowa delegates are jollying each oth
er over their actions at the coliseum
yesterday when the suffrage plank in
the platform was announced At the
conclusion of that part of it which sfcid
that the women were deserving of suf
frage, the advocates of the measure
broke loose with cheers and those
members of the Iowa delegation who
were in accord joined in the demon
stration and threw their hats and oth
er things Into the air. Several
among them W. T. Harper of Ottumwa
—did not join the demonstration and
Immediately they were made a target
for the others. But Mr. Harper hap
pened to know what the entire plank
said, so he merely laughed at his crit
ics and advised them to wait until they
heard It complete. When the dem
onstration died down and permitted
the reader to add that the matter was
a proper one for the states to pass up
on, the Ottumwan said: "Now if you
see any occasion to cheer, I'll

FATHER ON STAND
DEAD GIRL/8 PARENTS WILL
TESTIFY IN CASE AGAINST
YOUNG 8TUDENT.
Waukegan, 111., June 9.—At the trial
of Will Orpet, charged with the mur
der of Marion Lambert, Frank Lam
bert, father of the dead girl, was called

neer, who explained the territory sur
rounding the scene of the tragedy
with the aid of a plat of the woods
which he drew, and Walter McGuire,
chief of police of Lake Forest, who
described the finding of the girl's
body in the snow and of tracing the
footprints which the state says Orpet
made as he wondered about the woods.
All witnesses in the case were ex
cluded from the court room yesterday
with the exception of Mr. and Mrs.
Frank Lambert, parents of the dead
girl, and Mr. and Mrs. E. O. Orpet,
parents of the defendant.

tary, and the members of the war

COMMENCEMENT IS
SUCCESSFUL EVENT
Graduation Exercises Held
in Opera House Show the
Students' Training
The class of 1916 of the Ottumwa
high school turned the last page In its
history Thursday evening, when the
unusually interesting commencement
exercises were held at the Grand opera
house, which was filled to capacity
with admiring hosts of relatives and
friends.' The stage was simply decor
ated with potted ferns, the class col
ors, blue and gold being used to decor
ate the boxes and balcony.
For the processional, the high school
orchestra played the march from Wag
ner's Tannhauser, as the seniors took
their places. The effect of the white
gowns, and corsage bouquets of roses
worn hy the girls, and the black and
white of the boys' clothes was very
pretty. Rev. W. C. Hengen rector of
Trinity church, who gave the invoca
tion, was presented by Superintendent
H. E. Blackmar. The salutatory address
was given by Miss Helen Rowe in a
very pleasing manner, a special tribute
being paid to Miss Lucille Welch,
whose recent death has given a tinge
of sadneBs to the closing events of the
class.
Good Addresses Made.
The boys' glee club gave a pretty
number, Blush Roses, by Wachs, which
was much enjoyed. An oration. The
Spirit of the Game by Homer Gardner,
was full of the spirit of good sports
manship, which makes a good loser
and a good winner both in school and
later life. A difficult and beautiful
piano duet, A la Biens Aimee (Schutt)
was given in a finished manner by
Misses Esther Stewart and Marvel
Somers. Miss Winnie MoBride fol
lowed with an oration. The Cost of Effi'
ciency, touching on the ability of the
Individual to attain any height if will
ing to pay the prioe. The girls' glee
club sang the charming, Softly My
Heart Unfolds, by St. Saens.
Oscar Root took as his subject, Also
Ran, and gave an interesting oration
on the extreme desirability of stud
ents and citizens of the world who
work right along faithfully whether
they attain high school or later life
honors. The senior boys' double quar
tet sang a clever glee, Rosalie by R.
de Koven, Which scored a hit. The In
evitable, was the subject of a well de
livered oration by George Killlnger,
which was followed by a musical num
ber, Viennese Serenade (Stevenson)
by the mixed glee club, accompaiiled
by Helen Rowe and Lawrence Elliott,
pianos, Miss Marie Worrell, violin,
and Miss Marion Hallberg, cello, with
Miss Katherlne Powers, as director.
The valedictory address, in which
Miss Gladys Lester said the slxteens'
goodbyes to high school, was followed
by a brief address in which Principal
Ward B. Rice recommended the class
for graduation. G. F. Heindel, In a
few words, expressed his pleasure in
presenting the diplomas to so large a
class, the students rising as the rollr
was 'called. An amusing bit of by
play, indicative of class spirit, was
put on by four boys in clown cos
tumes, when the '16's were declared
dead and the '17's rulers. The class
song and yells completed a successful
and enjoyable program. Much credit
is due the musical organizations as
well as to the young speakers who
gave the commencement talk this
year in lieu of the address by an out
of town speaker as in former years.

WAS ATTRIBUTED
AMERICAN AMBASSADOR AT BGft
LIN REPUDIATES STATEMENT
ON PEACE EFFORTS.
Berlin, June. 9.—American ambassa
dor Gerard has repudiated an inter
view recently attributed to him on
President Wilson's peace efforts, the
Overseas News agency says. The am
bassador also is quoted as asserting
that Count Frledrich von Westarp,
conservative leader in the reichstag,
desired Mr. Gerard to have a spurious
interview published some time ago
but that the ambassador declined.
DISCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY.
Amsterdam, June 9.—The Vossiche
Zeltupg of Berlin declares that Am
bassador Gerard disclaims all respon
sibility for what wae represented as an
interview with him, published by the
Berlin Achtuhr Abendblatt and quoted
In the reichstag by Count 'von West
arp. The fact Is, according to the
Vossiche Zeltung, that Mr. Gerard re
ceived the editor of the National Zel
tung, to whom he said that the visit
to the United States of Joseph 0.
Grew, secretary of the American em
bassy at Berlin, was purely for pri
vate purposes. The ambassador de
clined to reply to other questions.
Later the editor of the National Zei
tung returned, the Vossiche Zeitung
says, with a manuscript containing u^
terances attributed to the ambassa
dor. Mr. Gerard is said to have torn
up the paper in the presence of John
B. Jackson, a member of the embassy
staff.
Interview Represented.
The National Zeitung on Saturday
published what was represented to be
an interview with Mr. Gerard, which
was referred in a cable dispatch from
Berlin as bearing on its face indica
tions of unauthenticlty. The ambas
sador was quoted as saying he be
lieved peace was only a few months
off and as referring to President Wil
son's peace utterances In connection
with the presidential campaign.. In
the reichstag on Monday Count von
Westarp declared his uncomprlslng
opposition to President Wilson as a
peace mediator. Chancellor von Beth
mann-Hollweg announced he had re
ceived no official Intimation that the
president intended to offer mediation.
The state department a few days
ago cabled to Mr. Gerard an inquiry
whether he was responsible for two
alleged interviews on the subject of
peace which were credited to him in
Berlin dispatches.
