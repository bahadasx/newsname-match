MEERSCHAUM MINES.

Thousand Years...'
- ((Special to The ' Bulletin.)
Washington, D. C, June 9. If the
shade of the smoker's pipe were of as
much moment as the hue of roilday's
spring costume the possible ehortare
In the meerschaum market might have
attracted as much attention in Amer
ica, since the beginning of the war, as
has the interruption of our aniline dye
trade with Germany, for . the. main
source of the world's supply of this
earthly mineral lies in tha zone of hos
tilities. The National Geographic So
ciety, with headquarters in Washing
ton, in its' war geography bulletin is
sued today, gives the following little
known facts about the meerschaum
mines of Eeid-sehr, the moslem city of
zu.uuu people which lies 2W miles to
the south of Constantinople, on the
banks of the Purs ale Su, in Asia Min
or: , - ........
'Meerschaum, which derives " its
name from the fact that particles of
it were discovered - floating on the
Black Sea, giving rise to the belief
that it was petrified sea -foam, has
been dug from the alluvial deposits in
tee plains near- Eski-sehr for a thous
and years. Some of the meerschaum
beds, located about 18 miles from the
city, have as many as 2,000 openings.
nere 4,000 iturda and Persians, in
groups of from three to fifteen, bur
row through yard-wide holes to depths
of from 20 to 200 feet, working night
and day under the flickering tight of
oa lamps. The lumpts of mineral
clay which they seek is commercially
valuable in nodules as small as a hazel
nut, while occasionally pieces as
large as apples are found.
'When the meerschaum is first
brought to the surface it has a gray
ish or yellowish tinge and is so soft
that it can be scraped with a knife.
In the summer it is left to dry In the
sun, but in the winter it is placed
in ovens where it is subjected to a
steady temperature day and night for
nine days, when it becomes snow1
white and loses two-thirds of its
weight. After being rubbed with flan
nel and polished with, wax it is wrap
ed in cotton and sent to Austria or
America to be resoaked in water until
it Is so soft that it can be cut like
cheese, after it is sawn Into conven
ient pipe shape, elaborately carved if
desired, and fitted with amber stems
from Germany. Before the war the
vaiue of Eski-sehr's meerschaum ex
ports was more than $1,300,000 an
nually. "Even the most aesthetically in
clined of our American millionaires
would hardly consider the luxury of
living in a palace built of meerschaum
as within the range of their fortunes;
yet there are many ,: unpretentious
houses o this material-in- the Span-:
ish town of Vallecas. , near Madrid,
where a coarse . variety .of . thia-iulbi
stance is to be foumk On the other
hand,, the -Moroccans,-just across the
straits of Gibraltar, find that still an -
otner variety of meerschaum lathers
freely and they use it, perhaps spar
ingly, as a substitute for soap. . :
"The chips and saw dust of the
meerschaum pipe factories make - an
excellent claansing powder for remov
ing stains from costly fabrics. An in
ferior pipeMs also made from these
scraps, the fragments being bound to
gether with some solution and then
molded into blocks. -
"Meerschaum is found in Greece
and in Hrubschitz, Moravia, as well as
in Asia Minor, and to a limited ex
tent in Pennsylvania. South Carolina
and in the upper Gila valley, near Sil

WHEN DOES WOMAN BUY ?
The answer to this question has a bearing on the business of the
modern merchant which is sometimes overlooked by those who are try
ing to give their patrons the best of service.
Statistics show that the woman is the purchasing agent of the
world in all things relating to the home. Three-fourths of all the pur
chases effected in the retail shopping centers of large communities are
made between the hours of 10 a. m. and 3 p. m.
The woman may be a potential buyer the night before; she may
have a definite idea about her needs- and purchases, but before she
starts to shop she picks up the morning newspaper to see what of
ferings the merchants are making that may interest her. or be applied
to her purpose. '
' i Catch her eye then. Make the shopping suggestion that strikes a
responsive chord and fits In with her scheme of things and all else is
forgot. ' ' , r : .
. The merchant's message which reaches the woman in the home
through the morning newspaper is the most effective that can be st-n't.
See that your message to the women of Norwich and vicinity is In The
