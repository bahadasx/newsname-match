i Confused Seas
YE begin to suspect
W that the war in
Europe will come to a
close pretty soon; that
it will be forced to a
close, not by the sol
diers on land and the
sailors at sea, but by
the united voices of
great financiers of the
nations at war getting
together and impress
ing upon their respect
ive governments the
fact that the war must
be stopped or chaos
will come.
Then what? It is a
natural anticipation
that as many of the
poor of those distressed
nations as possible will
seek our shores and
tired and hungry as
they will be will seek
employment at such
wages as they can com
mand, in competition
with our working class
es. What will happen
then? But Harden in
his wonderful letter re
ferred to in another
, column points out an-
other probability which
-" is that to meet the in
terest on the awful
debt that has been cre
ated; all the profits of
the business of all
classes will have to go
to meet the interest
charges on that debt
unless a new financial
adjustment can be
made, and all who
have a little money left
will take it and seek
other countries for in-
I vestment. They would
naturally come here
and seize upon every
enterprise which prom
ised a reward. But
then another problem
would be presented.
This production would
have to find a market
beyond our shores.
Where could that be
found? We have no
ships, and if we had
there are not sufficient
I markets outside of Eu-
S rope to absorb the goods
and Europe will be too
I poor to buy. Harden sug
gests a plan for all the
Successful Men of Utah

Mfe HE story of A. O. Jacobson is that of a typical westerner who has made good from the
m C start, and that start in his real life work really began at thirteen years of age, when
. J he worked in the mines during the vacation periods and attended school in the win
""" ter. He was born here on the 28th day of May, 1871, at the Jacobson homo in the
eastern part of the city, the homestead embracing a twenty acre tract covering the area now oc
cupied by the plant of the Salt Lake Brewing Company and the Hobday nursery. Ho received
his early education at St. Mark's school and later in the schools of Nevada. He has been actively
engs&ed in mining continuously since sixteen years of age, and has workeu in all of the big
mines of this state, as well as in a number of mines in Nevada, and during that- time has held
responsible positions in some of the biggest producers in the two states. ;
He owned a large tract of land in Eureka, in what was known some time ago as the Eu
reka Townsite, the ground being designated as non-mineral bearing and the mineral rights there
for forfeited. This ground is now known as the Chief Consolidated Mining Company at Eureka,
proving how wrong the theory was that it was valueless from a minine standpoint. In 1890
he was married in Eureka to Miss Mnie Kell, and they have a family of six boys and six girlR
A year after his 'marriage he and In irother, Tony Jacobson, secured an option on the Columbus

nations to adopt, in H
some respects like that M

scale in our panic in '' M

house certificates, to ' M
be used by all the "f
world as money and in .tH
that way hold the M
mighty war debt in sus- v H
pension, so to speak, H
for two or three gener- M
ations, to permit the ex- M
hausted nations to recu- ., M

We may reasonably M
suppose that the finan- H
ciers of Europe and H
Great Britain are re- .H
volving all kinds of ',' H
plans in their minds ''H
and that when they H
agree upon one, that H
then, by a preconcerted H
understanding they will H
unite in demanding ;. H
from their respective H
governments that the t M
war must stop. H
Should this be real- H
ized, then what part in H
the business would our iaH
country play, and what M
would be the business H
conditions here at H
home? In the days of H
sail ships when a mighty H
storm had been raging H
until the great deep H
was thoroughly en- H
raged, if the winds were H
suddenly laid, ships at H
once lost their steer- H
ageway and rolled help- H
lessly until the tuinb- H
ling seas ran down. H
Would not that be the H
natural result to the H
business of our coun- H
try? That thought caus- H
es thoughtful men to H
wait anxiously for the H
nominations of the re- H
spective political par- H
ties. In the conventions H
the question is, "Who is H
the most available can- H
didate? It should be, H
who can we find in our H
party who is great and H
wise enough to steady H
our ship of state in the H
confused seas that it H
will be liable to en- H
counter in the coming H
. few months? No won- H
dor thoughtful men are H
troubled? H
