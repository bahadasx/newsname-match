Commissioners
At the, meeting of county commis
sioners last Monday a petition was
presented bearing the signatures of
a goodly number of citizens of Pa
naca, requesting that no saloon li
cense be granted to persons wishing
to conduct a saloon business either
at Panaca or Bullionville. The mat
ter was laid over until next meet
ing. After a discussion of the matter,
of commission for the sale of hunt
ing licenses, it was decided to allow
25 per cent on resident licenses and
50 per cent on non-resident licenses.
Mrs. Mae Pitcher made complaint
to the board that a certain cesspool
that a certain cesspool in front of
the court house was a menace to
health and after investigation, the
nuisance was ordered abated.
A communication from C. A. Nor
cross recommending that a county
agricultural agent be appointed re
ceived scant consideration for the
reason that the board took the view
that the county had no funds with
which to maintain such a depart
ment as proposed by Mr. Norcross.
At the May meeting, F. W Dlckla
presented a claim for $265, alleging
that the commissioners had sold

MERCHANT'S TAX UPHELD
BY SUPREME COURT
District Attorney Saunders of Nye
county, who is in Elko as special
prosecutor in certain criminal cases
recieved a telegram this morning
from Carson that the supi5nie court
had sustained the county ordinance
1 rovlding that the intrcharf.-'. K com
pepelled to pay an ocour-ation tax
The matter is :i inr.trejt to Klko
county officials ;ts that cour.ty haa a
similar ordinance. Some j-Kmtl.fi ago
several merchants of Tonopah were
tried and the district court held t;iat
under an old supremo court ruling,
tho tax was not compulsory. District
Attorney Saunders took an appeal
and the decision of the supreme court
yesterday is the result. This decision
will mean a large addition to the
revenue of the counties having such
an ordinance. Elko Independent.
BALANCE RATIONS
FOR WORK HORSE
A hard working horse, when he
first comes into the stable, should be
given a medium forkful of well-cured
mixed hay and should not be given
grain until the hay is consumed. 1 he
food will be then digested while ho is
resting.
The proper food for a working
horse to make a balanced ration is:
Sound oats, four quarts; wheat bran
two quarts ana shelled corn, ore
quart. The grain feed may be reduc
ed when the horse- is not working
For old horses, chrushed oats, mixed
with wheat bran, makes an excellent
ration. For a horse at steady work,
eight pounds of crushed oats and five
pounds of mixed hay, three times
daily, except when idle, with mixd
fed on Sundays is the regular feed
for horses at steady work in some
stables.
The condition of the horses de
pends largely on the treatment of
the animal. A careful teamster, one
who favors his team, will accom
plish the maximum amount of work
without overworking his team.
RANCHMEN DRIVING
CATTLE TO MODENA
H. I. Olinghouse and other Lin

market and began driving their
herds to Modena the point of de

developed that the county ha.l deed

purchase of the same, to Wm. E.
Orr. He asked that the purchase

had paid for taxes, and interest be
returned to him. The commission
ers laid the matter over for investi

J. D. Campbell was appointed

standing that he be allowed actual
travelling expenses when called out
of town on official business.
Complaint was made to the boaid
that the water from the tail
ings pond of the Con. Nevada-Utah
mill was allowed to run down Main
street without any attempt being
made to control it. This resulted
in instructions to the clerk to not
ify the mill management that the
condition must be changed.
The petition signed by a large
number of property holders in the
Pioche School district asking for a
special levy to obtain $1500 for the
improvement of Main street, was
laid over for the reason that the pe-,
tition was not legally drawn.
"BILLY"- PALMER CALLED.
TO THE OTHER SIDE
After a protracted Illness, W. C.
Palmer, always known as "Billy"
Palmer, died at the home of Mrs.
Mae Pitcher, on Pioche street, last
Thursday evening. The deceased
was 52 years of age and had been
resident of Pioche for about ten
years.
"Billy" Palmer had many friends
who will be deeply grieved by his
taking away. He leaves no rela
tives here, but has a brother resid
ing at Providence, R. I., who has re
quested that the remains be shipped
there for interment; which will
probably be done today.

PIOCHE, LINCOLN COUNTY. ! NEVADA, JUNE 10 1016
Looks ulie
At Chicago Conventions
The Republican and Progressive party national conven
tions convened at Chicago last Wednesday. At this writing
all measures looking toward success in the effort to bring
about a reconciliation, and the nomination of a presidential
ticket agreeable to both, has failed. However there is sill hope
and in' all probability the final result will not be known until
sometime today. Meanwhile, there is preponderoud sentiment
in the Republican convention that Justice Charles E. Hughes
should be the party's standard bearer. On the other hand, the
Progressives insist on the nomination of their idol, Theodore
Puo;ovolt. The keynote speech in the Republican convention
was delivered by Senator Harding of Ohio and is as follows:
Chicago, June 7. Senator Warren
O. Harding of Ohio as temporary chair
man of the Republican national conven
tion today sounded the keynote of the
party's campaign. His address was
in part as follows:
Gentlemen of the Convention: It
is good to greet this representative
body of that American Republican
ism on which are centered the high
hopes of the republic. I can believe--nay,
I know that a vast majority of
the people of our United States is ex
pecting the party sponsors here assem
bled to write anew the sacred cove
nant of Republicanism, and reconse
crate the party to the nation's service
and the people's advancement. That
same majority expects you to select a
standard-bearer who shall not only
typify our expression of faith, but
shall so enlist the confidence and trust
of our American citizenship that the
work of this convention will be con
firmed overwhelmingly at the ballot
box next November.
Th country, wearied afresh by a
disappointing and distressing Demo
cratic administration, is calling for
Republican relief, and there, is every
inspiration, every encouragement, ev
ery, confidence that the light of Repub
lican conscience, set aflame in this
convention, will illumine the way to
We did not do very well In making
for harmony the last time we met.
The country has regretted, let us for
get and make amends to our country.
We did not divide over fundamental
principles, we did not disagree over a
national policy. We split over meth
ods of party procedure and preferred
personalities. Let us forget the dif
ferences, and find new inspiration and
new compensation in an united en
deavor to restore the country.
The essential principles of Repub
licanism are unchanged and unchang
ing; the lofty intent, the indestructi
ble soul and the undying spirit of Re
publicanism are as dominant today as
in the destined beginning 60 years
ago, or at any time during the inter
vening years, and they are empha
sized today by the proof recorded to
Republican credit in the matchless
chapters of American progress.
The World at War.
Much of the discussion of the hour
is hinged upon a world at war. We
peed not wonder thereat, because the
enormity of the conflict and the influ
ences of its upheaval have set men-
kind in upheaval. The traditions of
civilization have been broken and in
ternational laws have been Ignored.
There Is a tidal wave of distress and
disaster, there are violent emotions
and magnified fears. There are the
extremes of incalculable sacrifices
and measureless new fortunes not
all American. There are new won
ders and new hindrances in com
merce, changed balances of trade,
new marvels in finance and utterly
changed economic conditions. These
have attended embarrassments in our
foreign relations as difficult as those
which the individual citizen experi
ences whose every neighbor is in
volved in deadly quarrel. Everything
is abnormal except the depleted con
dition of the federal treasury, which
is characteristic of Democratic con
trol, and the facility of the admlnia
tration in writing varied notes with-
out effective notice.
Perhaps It is a reminder more than
a discovery, but there has come to
us a conviction that this great nation,
rich in resources and strong in pa
triotic manhood, has been negligent
concerning its own defense. We have
dwelt in fancied rather than real se
curity. Pride mingles with regret In
this, because It suggests the mind of
a nation so free from Intended of
fense that there was no cultivated
thought of needed defense. Our right
eousness of purpose is portrayed In
mii trust in unarmed safety. But
there fs a warning in bleeding Eu
rope, and there Is a call today for pro
dent, patriotic and ample national de
fense. There is no mistaking the sen
timent. We are not thinking of the
hysterical. we need not be moved by
Deadlock
a preparedness which is partisan Ii
conception. We need not believe in
a defense propaganda Inspired by
those who aim to wax fat in the pro
ductlon of arms and munitions, be
cause there Is, none. 1 deplore the
teaching tliat an anxiety about our na
tional defense is inspired by greed.
We rejoice in free speech and free
press and untrammeled opinion, but
patriotism is illy promoted by the im
putation of false motives, whether
aimed at those who believe in defense
or those who doubt its wisdom. Such
a teaching rends the concord of citi
zenship, which may develop a worse
peril from within than from any en
emy without.
Though we do not pretend to be
exclusive in our devotion, we Repub
licans believe, incerely and soberly,
in adequate national defense. We
have always believed in an ample
navy, as invincible in modern might
as John Paul Jones builded In our
freedom's earliest fight. We have In
mind a protected commerce on the
waters, and a seacoast secure in
strong naval defense. We were build
ing to high rank among naval powers
when the Democratic party interrupt
ed, and we subscribe to a stronger
committal now, because of a new re
alization of the envy which our
wealth and our commerce Invite, and
a new appreciation of our command
ing place in the affairs of the world
I shall not say that It is ours to have
the greatest navy in the world, but
noting the elimination of distance and
the passing of our onetime Isolation,
we ought to have a navy that fears
none In the world, and can say any
time and anywhere: These are Amer
lean rights and must be respected.
No Curse of Militarism.
Let no one apprehend the curse of
militarism in this fair lard. Wo de
clare unalterably against It. Our
free citizenship, walking confidently,
absorbed in the triumphs of peace
would tolerate no such blight on
American Institutions. There is no
surrender of cherished ideals. With
that yearning for peace which has
marked our continued development
with that same committal to justice
which has given us front rank in the
Senator Warren G. Harding.
onward march of civilization, with
that rare unselfishness which led us
to unsheath the sword for humanity's
sake and put all territorial aggrandize
ment aside, with that belief in the
square deal, individual, national and
international, which Is the foundation
of American faith, we mean to go on,
an exemplar of peace to all the na
tions, an arbiter of justice to all the
world, a promoter of righteousness
to all the people of the earth.
At the same time we have more to
do than to chart a national course
through the waters surging with tb
turbulence of war; our Inspiring
course is on the highway of peace.
Our armed defense must ever be
linked with our industrial self-reli
ance, and the nation worth dying for
must first be worth living for. Out of
nature's prodigality we have incal
culable resources and limitless possi
bilities, and there is need only for
the unhindered application of man's
genius and industry to make us as in

SENATOR PITTMAN WANTS

Senator Pittman has introduced in

committee on Judiciary a bill pro
viding for an additional United
States federal Judge for the district
of Nevada. The bill also nroviden
that terms of the federal court shall
be held at Tonopah, Goldfield Win

The passage of this bill will great
ly expldite litigation in the federal

The present court at Carson City ia
now congested and many cases have
been pending for a year or longer.
It is a enormous expense, for in
stance to take a greater number of
witnesses frdm Tonopah to Carson
City for the trial that involves ques
tions arising in Nye county. If ti ioh
cases could be tried in Tonopah there
would be no expense of transporta
tion of witnesses, nor of litigants
and witnesses would not be inter
fered with in their ordinary busi
ness except for the brief time that
they would be giving their testimony.
At the present time it is almost im
possible for a poor man to stand the
expense incident to transporting and
maintaining his witnesses at Carson

POSTAL SAVINGS ACT
INCREASES DEPOSIT LIMIT
Larger postal savings deposits will
now be accepted at the Pioche post
office. This is made possible by an Impo
tant amendment, to postal savings
act Just approved by President Wil
son. A postal savings depositor may
now have an account amounting to
$1,000 upon which interest will be
paid. Formerly $500 was the maxi
mum amount he could have to his
credit. This enlargement of postal
mvlngs facilities will be very gratify
ing to thousands of depositors who
have already reached the old $500
limit and are anxious to entrust more
of their saving to Uncle Sam. An
other feature of the amendment that
will avoid further embarrassment to
the public and to postal officials is
the doing away with the limit on the
amount that could be accepted from a
depositor monthly. Under the old law
only $100 could be deposited in a
calendar month. The amendmnt
abolishes this restriction.
TONOPAH MAN INVENTS
NEW MINE CAGE DEVICE
George . J. Newell has been al
lowed a patent on his automatic
safety mining cage on May 16 1916.
The invention has been placed in
hands of J. H. Frisby, who has
patented the invention for one half
Interest. , The invention is one
which will prevent the cage drop
ping and would eliminate all acci
dents of that character. Mr. Frishby
has applied for a patent on a in
vention of his own which will work
In connection with the automatic
safety cage. It is an electric signal
system installed in the cage, per
mitting the person in the cage to
communicate with the engineer by
means of a telephone. This contrl
vance will falicitate repair work,
since the engineer can be immed
lately Informed of the location of
the trouble, and what is necessary
to repair it.
Mr. Frisby's flirst Btep for public
ity will be to secure a recommenda
tion from the state inspector of
mines, who will bring the matter
before the Mine Ownsre' associatio.
Frisby's invention will recieve fur
ther advertising through the medi
um of mining and technical journ
als.
The original model of the safety
cage is at the Times office, as well
as the newer one which demon
strates Mr. Frisby's bell system.

boys in the base ball game played
at Fuller Park last Sunday. They
said they were going to do It and
they did. Many thought that the
town nine would make a better ac
count of itself; but apparently it
was not on the program that they
should, and all that talk about Bow
ling getting "revenge" on Concan-
non, exploded like a circus baloon.
It may be that Bowling's arm gave
out; or it may have been something
else anyway he didn't come home
with the bacon and after the fifth
inning he turned the ball over to a
new man. Singleton, who came to
town just in time to get in on tho
