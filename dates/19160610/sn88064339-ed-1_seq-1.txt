SAtr aitr,',eable incident not on the

~of congratulation to the class of 1611
front Mr. Frank lBacot of Baton Rouge.

Another was the formal presentation
of the. senior class memorial: a glass
N and mahogany case for the safe be
it sowal of the sllver cup won three
twars successively at the ptate Rally
hb the class in physical culture of
Jlulius Freyhan High Schohl. The cup

wetll-c'hose words John ira laaniel
. pre.alnte'd the- mlemorial later. the
principal. Mr W. H. Blits, expressed
" the, appreclation of the school for this
and oither benefactions front the class
of Ili6.
.r ttill another surprise was that after
Miss Mamtle Decker had read her
proph.ey. which purported to be print
e'd in The' True Democrat, eglht years
hence. and contained many bright pre.
i dkirtions for her elaasmates, but none
It for herself, a small boy in the audience
handed up a telegram,. which when
read announced that Miss Decker had
,jut received an appointment bringing
her in ,i000t a week. This innovation
was devised by Miss Jeanette Levy
,of 'll The Trte Democrat apprcelates
Mis DeIeker's bringing this paper into 1
the, focus of view In 1924. but venturesr
the hope that the paper will pass be i
)oned its average of four pagesl to a
ales commensurate with the bhped-for
aechioiementil of the class of 191.
The address by Prof. Sanders of
.ouisiana State University was very I
Nfie alnd free from the fault of most r
erenllt'e(''1ne. 1nt addresses was not long 1
Ils peroration was partlicularly good, f

f" The- daisy la our flower,

Sits fringel of snowy petal.,

The. poets crlled it day's eye
1 For it openst with the morn;
it Krois' IIn field and bower
\,ed all Nature does adorn.
Small, but strona and hardy.
Is this dainty little fower.
Never resting. growing ever
In sunshline and In shower.
Our class is like the daisy,
Fl"ililn bravely each his plae,
And meeting task and play-time
With bright and shining face.
I Do all you can, as well as you can,
I la the motto of our choeie;
It urges us to nobly work
With hand and soul and voice.
t go may our chain of daisies,
With sixteen links so strong,
pIndure In love and friendship
Though future years be long.
The class history by Jobin Ira Daniel
reads
"lrinee the histories of all great or.
Ianlltationu are demanded by the ad
miring world, it has befallen me to
write this, the history of the class of
1916. I realise that in order to write
a true and complete history it is necs
sary to give the date of birth, hosme
and brief sketch of the characte.rs
treated. It would be imposilble for
me to tax my hearers, though, with all
the nlterestiet details necessary for a
comnplete history, therefore In this fro'g
meat 1 shall give only a few facts
concerning the class as a whole.
"in lSeptembr. 1#12, a rather large
crlass entered high school and began
their four years' journey. Blat some
fell by the wayside, some sought other
professions and some evidently sought
other climes; anyway they difted out
ere we reached our senior year. Among
thisoriginal class were the seven follow
int. Leon Doherty, Nattalee Doherty,
ltmie rDeckr, D)aisay Bookter. Mel
Ieaake, Jeanette Levy, and John Ira
IDaniel, These seven are the asle re
mininder of the freshman class. The
first year of hllh school glided by.
work was not extremely hard. and
teachers were not very strict. To us.
four }ears ,osemend half a century. and
at thin tihme we did not realise our duty
as workers. We went to school be
catuse it was customary, because every
one our age did the same thing. The
sevesn whom I have mentioned before,
passed into the sninth gIrade and here
we were joined by two worthy mem
hers. Annie kelle Harvey. our valedeic
tortan. from Fre'eland, and 1mnter Ball
freml I k)aidasonvie,
It Iewn then that work bngan In
caret anrd isany. many times that
year aftner burning midalnght oil. and
in the privacy of our rooms at home
did the sinth-graders give vent to their t
feelingsa concerningl Algebra and the 0
brutality of the subjeet; and I ishalll
venture to saty that briny fluid 5ome
limes flowed. lHowever, despite ourt
diftficulties, we climbed Into the tenIth
grade and here we were joined by a
wanderer by the name of Allce Row
and she hailed from Wilhelm. This
year was marked by the progress of ot
icir Journey, for we waded deeper Into
the lakes of( Itin and began our )jour
cy ulp MtI teometry. At the end of
Iilce months we were over the rough l
place, and ready to begin our last
years' work It seems that there musti
have been both faclnatlon and attrate
lton about this class. foF durtiag the
