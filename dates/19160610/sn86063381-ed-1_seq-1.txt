RIVER DAM/GING LAND 3
Entitled to Outlet.
"The large area of low lands in
western Koochiching county and
eastern Beltrami county that are, or
should be drained into the rivers flow
ing into Red Lake, must have, and are
entitled to a proper outlet into Red
Lake, according to the lake's normal
high level of 1,175 feet above sea
level. The present level of the lake
is now between four and five feet
above its normal, and is choking up
the outlets for the present ditches,
as well as new ditches that might he
built, and in the Tamarack river val
ley alone, hundreds of settler's landb
are entirely flooded, driving the set
tlers from their homes on account
ot the high stage of water in Red
Lake This high stage is caused by
the more rapid run-off flowing into
the lake on account of the present
drainage ditches, and the outlet
through the Red Lake river is not
adequate for taking care ot this rush
of water.
Ask Co-operation.
"Therefore, we pray for you to take
proper jurisdiction to determine up
on the methods of a fair co-operation
between the land owners in the Red
Lake valley, the state of Minnesota
and the Federal government for the
deepening, widening and straighten
ing of the channel of the Red Lake
river trom its outlet from the lake
in Sec 28, Township 152, Range 36,
approximately 27 miles to a point just
above Highlanding in Sec 29, Town
ship 153, Range 40, Pennington
county This will mean about 10
miles of new channel caused by the
straightening of the river and 17
miles of deepening of the present
channel, at an approximate cost of
$225,000 which, as it is a navigable
river, one-third should be borne by
the Federal government for better
navigation purposes, one-third by the
state government and one-third by
the land owners, and under the twen
ty-year state drainage law this would
mean, at the end of the fifth year an
appropriation by the state of $5,000
per year and interest By the Fed
eral government, from the river and
harbor bill of $5,000 per year and
interest, and by an assessment
against the lands benefited, whether
private owned or Indian lands, of $5,-
000 per year. And by the deepen
ing of this channel in such a way,
it would provide for the lowering of
the main body of Red Lake during
the winter time, to such an extent
that the waters brought in by the
ditches from the spring flood would
not overtax and raise the lakelike it
has this spring.
Hearing Requested.
"If at a proper hearing in your
court, it is found that special legis
lation is needed by the state or Fed
eral government to carry out this
work, and furnish this relief as out
lined, we respectfully petition you to
determine as quickly as possible what
state or Federal government is need
ed and to communicate those wants
to congress and to the state legisla
ture at this winter's session, so that
needed improvements under your jur
isdiction could be commenced not
later than tfie spring of 1917."

T. R.
(By United P^ess.)
Chicago, June 10.There will be
three parties in the presidential race
this year.
The Progressives this afternoon
nominated Roosevelt by acclamation.
Takes One Minute.
Roosevelt's own request for Lodge
for nomination was read when the
convention convened this morning.
Then bedlam broke loose Rules
were suspended and Roosevelt was
nominated The whole action took
about one minute.
To the last Perkins fought for a
compromise.
Governor Johnson of California
will probably be the vice president
Roosevelt would not make a state
ment this afternoon.
"Watchful Waiting."
For hours yesterday the Progers
sives marked time waiting for the
Republican convention to act. The
planks of the platform were discussed
at length and the convention ad
journed at 9:58 p. to 10:30 this
morning A request was received
from Colonel Roosevelt not to place
his name on the Progressive ballot.
Third Ticket Sure.
Today the Moose radicals were con
vinced that all conferences with the
Republicans were unavailing and
they prepared to name Roosevelt this
afternoon Out and out Progressives
admitted that their pussyfooting for
harmony was a mistake and that it
placed them in an awkward posi
tion- -as they were willing to bar
gain. They believed that a direct
action to dominate Roosevelt as the
first card would have been the best.
They would have then taken the cue
and the man who hits first and hits
hard has the best chances for vic
tory.
Excitement at Opening.
When the convention was called
this morning there was an air of
suppressed excitement and deter
mination to nominate Roosevelt.
There were scattered cheers and
many hisses that greeted the reading
of Roosevelt's suggetsion of Lodge as
a compromise to the Progressives. The
suggestion was tabled.
Johnson Opposed.
Governor Johnson of California
stated to a United Press representa
tive that the Progressives would
never accept Lodge.
"We'll tell the Colonel so in a lan
guage that he will understand," said
Johnson.
Perkins of Pennsylvania said:
"Why don't the Colonel name Hughes
as equally acceptable to the Moose?"
Governor Johnson announced that
the Progressives would nominate
Roosevelt this afternoon, to the press,
but declined to give an opinion about
Roosevelt's refusing to be a candi
date.
TEN DOGS SENTENCED

morning from a business trip to the
Twin Cities.

Supreme Court Justice is Man
of "Silence."
iVAS AT ONE TIME
PROFESSOR OF GREEK
Is Man Who Introduced Whiskers in
Politics is Cartoonist's
Delight.
(By United Press.)
Chicago, June 10.Hughes is the
man who introduced the whisker in
to the present day politics.
The former governor of New York
and present justice of the supreme
court is the cartoonist's delight.
Plenty of foliage on, any sort of a
face indicates Hughes in cartoons.
The Hughes whiskers used to be six
shades darker in their burnt orange
color than the justly famed soup
strainers sported by Senator James
Hamilton Lewis of Illinois.
Hughes is also famous for his
silence.
Lose Good Fighter.
When the former governor was ele
vated to the supreme bench New
York lost one of its best political
fighters in Republican ranks since
the days of Roscoe Conklin. He came
by his aggressive ability naturally,
being of Welsh descent. New York
knew him as a man would just as
soon scrap as sing, and he used to
do a good deal of the latter.
Born in Glenn Falls, New York,
on April 11, 1862, his father was Rev.
David Charles Hughes, direct des
cendant of a noted Welsh family,
while his mother before her marriage
was Miss Catherine Connelly. The
future justice studied at the public
school in Oswego while his father was
preaching there and later in Newark,
N. J., and in New York City, where
he was a pupil in "Old 35," one of
the metropolis' noted grammar
schools. His liking for oratory was
demonstrated early.
When only thirteen he delivered
the saluatatory address for his class
on graduation. His education was
completed at Madison, now Colgate
university, and at Brown university,
at both of which institutions he was
popular with fellow students, even
though he was very much of a stu
dent.
Teaches Greek.
After graduation Hughes essayed
school-mastering, teaching Greek and
mathematics in Delaware academy,
Delhi, N. Y. He also studied law at
odd moments in the office of Judge
Gleason.
In 1882 he entered Columbia Law
school, New York, and further stud
ied Blackstone in the office of Gen
eral Stewart L. Woodford, then U. S.
district attorney. He was admitted
to the bar in 1884 and was just or-

Washington, June 10.
Hughes sent the president this
message this afternoon:
"I hereby resign my office as
associate justice of the supreme
court of the United States."
(Signed) Charles Evan Hughes.
By United Press.)
Chicago, June 10.Justice Charles
Hughes for president and Charles
Warren Fairbanks for vice presi
dent. These are the nominations
made this afternoon by the Republi
can national convention.
Hughes was nominated by a vote
of 949 1-2 of a possible 987. Roose
velt secured 18 1-2 and was the
closest competitor. Later Hughes'
nomination was made unanimous.
Cummins Withdraws.
Illinois was the first of the favorite
sons to climb aboard the Hughes
wagon. Others followed rapidly.
Cummins withdrew, throwing Iowa,
Minnesota and both Dakotas unani
mously for Hughes.
La Follette got three votes on the
final in Wisconsin.
Chairman Harding sent Hughes the
following telegram:
"With deliberation and enthusiasm
under circumstances that could not
have been more complimentary and
with unanimity never excelled in the
past conventions, you have been nom
inated by Republicans of the nation
as their candidate for president of
the United States. We congratulate
you and the nation."
T. R. for Lodge.
The selection of Hughes came af
ter Roosevelt made an eleventh hour
effort for Lodge of Massachusetts.
The final vote was Hughes 949 1-2,
Roosevelt 18 1-2, Weeks 4, Lodge 5,
Dupont 5, La Follette, 3. Absent 1.
Hughes would not make a state
ment this afternoon.
Harding, however, announced to
the convention that Hughes would ac
cept and the Republican convention
adjourned sine die.
Ten Hours of Speeches.
The delegates sat through ten con
tinuous hours yesterday listening to
eleven nominating speeches. Justice
Hughes, Elihu Root, former Senator
Burton, Senator Weeks, T. Coleman
DuPont, Senator Sherman, former
Senator Fairbanks, Senator Cum
mins, Colonel Roosevelt, Senator La
Follette and Governor Brumbaugh
were placed in nomination.
When Senator Fall placed Roose
velt's name in nomination there was
a 41-minute demonstration. The ex
citement and oratory for Roosevelt
was mostly from the galleries. Hisses
came from the convention floor. Po
lice had to be sent to the galleries
to stop women from tearing bunting
from the railings.
Two Ballots Taken.
Two ballots were taken at the con
vention last night before it was ad
journed to eleven o'clock this morn
ing.
The first ballot resulted as follows:
Hughes, 253 1-2 Roosevelt, 65

maker, 5 not voting, 2. Total, 987.
Sons Unhappy.
The favorite sons were unhappy
this morning. The break in ranks
came with the exit of Senator Sher
man from the race and the throwing
of his delegates to Hughes. Frazzel
ed managers, almost sleepless, re
newed the battle unhappily this
morning. These included managers
for Burton, Cummins, Root and Fair
banks. All of them agreed not to
agree upon anyNme of themselves.
Overtures for vice presidency to con
solidate factions during the night
failed.
