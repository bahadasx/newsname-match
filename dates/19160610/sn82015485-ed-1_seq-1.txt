THE SONO ISSUE
Before Voting bonds for a newschool
buwtiing.for our district would it not
be wel! to take a loo'i and a good look
at tt.e one we have? The present
sri odi bui.'ding i3 frame buiWinu
in .is tr;.is, but is boxed, papered and
ei! buiit out of better material than
can be uhrained today, and will stand
for years to comewith-"buC very small
expenditure of money jn the way of
repairs, after its being repaired and
brought up to date. We repair and
modernize our homes,' our churches
and court houses, why notour school
houses? If a low pressure steam
heatiog apparatus is installed of
aequate power, the heating problem
is eliminated. A basement furnace
room can be made . absolutely lire
proof by building completely of ce
ment, a smoke stack of brick built on
tiitr outside, and full and satisfactory
radiation installed along with a good
-fire escape will make it safe and com
fortable. There is plenty of Toom to
install modern and sanitary plumbing
for both sexes, and we have the water
now in- the building. Then if the
weather boards below the lower win-
oa be reinforced with a good grade
of iron imitation of brick or cement
blocks, with other minor repairs, we
will have as pood and large a building
as can ne built for the amount of the
proposed expenditure upon a new
building. The improvements would
cost from $3000 to S.J-300. True the
present building is not fire proof.
i.he proposed build Iny is not lire
proof-- -T'ie old 'building they say
shakes in the wind: will the new
building be any better? At there
cent Commencement exercises at the
High School building- durimr . the
hight of the wind the building trem
bled perceptabiy and any two story
brick building will do the same.
What bends seldoms breaks is an old
adage but a true one. The man who
built the Court House built oar School
House, and we are told that the
roof is very strongly braced, and that
the building is a fa:r. sample of the
high standard of his work. A few
years ana the High School Board
spent $800 on the upstairs rooms. A
new roof and a first class cement
foundation have been added, wjth
other improvements, and it is un
timely and wasteful to destrov it and
add to what will soon be a great burden
if we continue such wasteful ex
travagance in other improvements
that must soon be made in our town.
Three carpenters who have worked
on the above mentioned building
have approved of the above state
ments. We repeat the invitation
take a good look before vou vote.

THAT THE VOTERS MAY KNOW
Under this head the Trego County
tee porter m its last issue pubiisnea
a statement signed by twenty-five
residents of our community regarding
the necessity and advisability of vot
ing 321,000 to construct a new
school building. The article will be
found in ttiis issue of the World.
Following this article in the Report
er, the advocates of the buildingdeny
that improvements to the present
building can be made at a cost of
from $3000. to $3500. Will say in
reply that tliose figures have been
furnished by experts; one of them
has inspected the building and figured
on the requirements and given us the
above tieures: he-had his price lists.
and was not guessing. They continue
bv savins: The old building was a
good one in its day but it has stood
tor thirt-ave years and is getting
feeble. This makes us smile. About
ten days ago this same buuch that
have been trving to discredit our
school building-for more than two
years, published a statement in the
Reporter that the building bad been
built thirtv-one years: very kind of
them to give us the falsehood by
installments; but even then we can
not swallow it for every one that
wants the facts can make sure that
the building- was erected in 1836
just 30 years "age. The statement
that the ouitaing was a good one in
its day, is true except the inference
that it. has had its day. . The .Metho
dist church was built the same year;
the Court House soon alter; in many
respects- they axe all .better tlian
when new; ine weatner ooaraing
should be renailed with No. 10 slims;
this will renail the boxing, at ' the
same time stiffen the building and
reduce -the motion of the building;
the floors could not be broken down;
some of the upstairs spring more
than is pleasant; that discrepency
can easily be-eliminated; there are
at least three plans to chose from
to accomplish this.
The statement that the building is
weak is farther from the truth than
the statement legarding its age.
Tl at such a good building covering
so much Ground could be weak and
dangerous is rediculous. No wonder
Mr. Blanch passed it oacs witnout
saying it. If rthe motion ot the
building was one-fourth as great as it
is represented to be there would not
be any plastering left. When the
old roof was tore oj a few years ago,
and before the new one could be put
on, several heavy showers beat in and
nearly ruined the plastering; it has
mostly been covered with metal and
other ceiling that is much better in
every way. .-If the bonds are defeat
ed the amount saved on the bonds
alone will pay for the improvements
in a little more than three years,, we
will have our building paid for and
other bonds a plenty, for when the
State. Board of Health says so, we
muse-' have sewers, and paving must
coaae later if not before. In con
clusion we will say that we all want
our school heuse safe, comfortable,
and made attractive outside and in.
We can arrange to do it at once, and
"the building should not be- neglected
with, : broken glass and burned out
stoves so the grates could not be kept
in place. Our school has been runn
ing years in violation of the law in
not having a fire escape, and we have
been very negligent in not providing
other improvements. '

nanwrial Day at Collyar
As has been the custom for the last
33 years, at Collyer without a single
omission citizens have gathered to give
honor, due -to those wbo have given
life and health to Dreserve our dear
old flag in its full glory with millions
of young men and women ready to
neio carry on the ureat work done bv
the men ot '61 to 'io. saying in their
ueeus ,ana hearts i'eace on Earth,
oooa win Toward Man," but ever
ready to fight when fight we mast to
save untarnished our glorious emblem
ui noeriy.
Only sir ot the dear did boys who
composed the post of 68 members are
left to us and the increasing number
or memorial boo nets is a sad remin
der of the absent ones, most of them
nave joined the ever increasing army
for which the last taps has sounaed
on this side of the great divide.
The Rev. Woodward delivered one
of the finest: addresses ever listened
to in our near old soldier town, it
could not iau to increase every spark
of patriotism and cause the bbvs and
girls to. understand what our prosper
ity or toaay nas cost and cause them
to be prepared should their time
come to carry tm- the work of those
gone before, and - with one accord we
thank Mr.-Woodward for the kindly
offer of his services to the vererans
whenever they wanted him.
John Parsons, as leader, assisted by
the Sons or Veterans, have taken up
the Memorial day observance and we
have no fear that Collyer will lose its
identity on that point.
It was tne old soldiers that settled
the town, it was they who carried on
Memorial services, and made it a not
ed for entertainment by their camp
tires and it is their sons and daugh
ters that will keep the memory of
the old soldier town green when there
win be ot the old post onlv Memorial
boquets; may these efforts ever be to
elevate-and make it a worthy repre
sentative of the old soldiers who
made it what it is today.
