GOOD
LOWER EXPENSE TO FARMERS
Good Roads Reduce Greatly Trouble
of Transporting Crops to Market
--Cause of Distress.
"Before the war in Europe affected
the rates at sea it cost the American
farmer more to haul a bushel of wheat
nine and a half miles to the railroad
station for shipment than it cost the
buyer to ship the same bushel of
wheat from New York to Liverpool, a
distance of 3,000 miles," according to
a bulletin issued by the American
Highway association. "The average
cost of hauling a ton of farm produce,
or a ton of anything else, over the sv
erage country road Is about twenty
three cents a mile; 70 years ago the
cost of the same service was 17 cents.
The cost of hauling over the railroads
is less than one-ninth as much as It
was 60 years ago. The cost of hauling
by railroad has almost reached the
vanishing point; the cost of hauling
on the country roads has gone up as
the ro~s have gone down.
"By careful calculation, Logan Wal
ler Page, director of the United States
offimce of public roads, has reached the
conclusion that with wise and equita
blc road laws and good busine man
agemen' it would be entirely practica
ble for the people to save themselves
on the two items of hauling and ad
ministration the enormous sum of
$200,000,000 yearly. The railroads i
the United States carry about 00,000,
000 tons of freight annually, and of
this vast tonnage at least 300,000,000
tons are hauled over the country reads
to the railroad station or to the canals
for shipment. The immense volume
of mining products aggregating mil
lions of tons is not Inclided in this
estimate, but only the agricultural,
forest and miscellaneous products
hauled by wagon over the public roads,
nor Is the cost of hauling back anad
forth between the farms and the mills.
"The main cause of agricultural dis
tress," says the bulletin, "a subject of
perennial alarm to 'popular favorites,'
Ir not so much the wages of the work
ers or the infertility of the soil or the
prices of the products, but the enor
mous drain of getting the stuff to
market, the waste of the roads in the
wear and tear of machinery, the sacri
fce of teams, the inecdlency of serv
Ice compelled by Impassable highways.
Tributary to every market town or
railroad statism there are what Mr.
Page calls 'sones of production.'
1rom the ar4 of these somes all prod
ucts can be dslivered to market at a
Shaded Road In the Wese
profit, and from the ruest oue classu of
products after another must be elim
Inated because of the prohibitive cost
of hauling, and beyond lie vast terrl
toriues that cannot be oultivated with
out the building and constant main
tenance of roads suitesd to whatever
tramc there may be dev61loped.
"It has been demonstrated that as
the roads from the market towns have
been improved there has been a great
Increase of their business and a corrne
sponding improvement in the con4i
tion and opportunities of the rurl
population, larguer prosperity of the
individusl rarmer, greater trae fior
the railroads, better supplUes sad low
er prices for the consumer. It does
not pay to raise crops that cannoat be
marketed readily and cheaply. Mil
Ions of dollars' worth of eld ad or
chard crops have been utterly wasted
because of expensive ad inadequate
fadillties for maruketing. This is oem
