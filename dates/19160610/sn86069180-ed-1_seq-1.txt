"Where Carranza's Financial Re

Slur Upon the Priesthood and
Church Absolutely Unde
served. CARRANZITA WORK IN YUCATAN
The revolution in Mexico brought
the Constitutionalists into power.
Or rather, tho revolution plus the
good services of Washington
achieved that result. The Constitu
tionalists are pledged to reform.
Their watchword and battle cry has
been reform. They have stood
forth as the saviours of the peon
class. They are now beginning to
put their ideas into practice, They
are seeking to fulfill their pledges
tq tho Mexican working people. The
State of Yucatan has been the con
splcuous ground for the Inaugura
tion of their work. Gen. Salvador
Alvardo is Governor of that place.
The visit or that gentleman to
New York In connection with the
building of a proposed Government
railroad has been the occasion for
an article on his work In the New
York Call of May 28. Modesto C.
Holland, a "full blooded Indian,"
. financial agent of the Mexican Gov
ernment in New York, whose pic
ture and opinions have appeared
frequently in tho Call, is the nar
rator of Alvardo'a achievements. So
far, it is declared, tho following
specific reforms have been at
tained in Yucatan: An agrarian law
has been adopted, returning tho
land to the peons; a modern de
partment of agriculture has been
founded and agents sent out to
educate the planters; a school sys
tem, for adults and children has
been established; lecture courses
have also been begun; the public
sorvlco corporations aro to be taken
over by tho Government and a
$50,000,000 corporation has been
formed to build a State owned rail
road from the Pacific to the Car
rlbean; "home rule" is being
nonlnilr Fr itha MHna-nrwl fllA vll-
lacea of the State. With all of
this, we understand, President Car
ranza is thoroughly in accord.
"Before the revolution," it is
stated, "there was considerably less
than a hundred schools In tho wholo
State. Now there aro 2,400. Theso
schools have taken tho placo of the
churches. Formerly there was a
priest upon every hacienda, but now
there is a school. Tho churches
have been closed or somo time,
and at first a few of tho people
were surprised that tho heavens
did not fall. But as nothing very
dreadful happened, they soon be
came accustomed to the change.
Tho priests have of course opposed
the reforms at every step, and have
been allied with reactionary Inter
ests." This is indeed interesting if it
at all bo true. Somo of the reforms
noted are certainly desirable. There
is much reason to suspect that they
ar,e In the mala reforms merely on
paper. Tho Jump from 100 schools
to -2,400 In so short a tlmo is
rather dubious, to say the least.
The $50,000,000 corporation will
have to show tho whence and
whither of its finances before we
can unreservedly rejoice in it.
Revolutions have always acted in
this peculiar way. They have
promised much to tho people of
tho "lower" classes; thoy have In
the first fow years of success and
power endeavored to fulfill their
promises and partially done so.
But when a few more years have
rolled by It4 has been found that
their programme has been of Injury
rather than of assistance to the
poor. So do wo fear will prove
the much tooted change in Mexico.
What great sufferings that revolu
tion has caused to the workers In
that stricken oountry wo already
have In part been told.
Tho slur upon the priesthood
and tho church Is absolutely unde
served. It Is there that Carranza's
New York financial representative
shows his hand. With tho eco
nomic reforms In Yucatan tho
church In itself has nothing to do.
With the particular manner of car
rying out agricultural activities It
can scarcely be neiu responsioie
It has not been in charge of the
Government. In tho manner of
education It has been handicapped
for over a hundred years. That la
always forgotten In the stories told
today of Mexico. The church can
not bo under ladlctment for abuses
In Mexico, Sho haB been hampered
In her work at every step. Sho has
been prohibited from carrying on
tho work of education. "Tho
Schools Supplanting Church in
Yucatan" runs tho headline in tho
article from which wo havo quoted.
That 13 a foolish and maUgnant
statement of tho case.
Tho noted traveler, Alexander
vpn Humboldt, In his Essai Poli
tique, has something to say of con
ditions among the laboring -people
before tho church was ovorpoworod
In Mexico. He writes from his
own- experiences in that country,
ft may be pardonable to state his
phrase again a pnrase wmen nas
no doubt been quoted before. "No
where," he says, "do the common
people enjoy the fruits of their
labor more than in Mexico, The
Indian laborer is poor but lie is
free. His condition is much
preferable to that of the peasantry
of a large part of northern Eur
ope." And Luinmls, who gives the
words of Humboldt In this regard,
has this to add: ''The Indian la
borers wore not slaves. There was
no mlta In Mexico; no compulsory
labor In mines; no labor without
wages. Tne Indian who did not
like the mine, or its administrator,
or lt& wages, was perfectly free to
go elsewhere or to stay out alto
gether." Tho true story of Mexico should
be told. It will not throw a shadow
In any way upon the Catholic
church as certain gentlemen seek
so painfully to do. It will show
that the church has brought a
light to Mexico and a policy of
Justice to the laborer, and that this
was destroyed only by those who
sought to destroy the church. We
fear that the representatives of the
Carranza Government should learn
better the history of their country.
Wo can not believe fronii past
knowledge that their "reforms"
will last. We know well how they
stand on the question of the church
In Mexico. And we know even bet
ter how strenuously Washington
strove to help Uiem to that power,
by which they have been able to
put their Idea as to tho church into
practice. C. B. of C. V.
mass for hush mahtyks.
On Tuesday morning, June 20, a
memorial requiem mass will be cele
brated at St. Mary Magdalen's
church In honor of the Irish revo
lutionists who fell fighting or were
cruelly executed in connection with
the recent uprising In Ireland. Per
mission has been granted by Bishop
O'Donaghue for this mass, which
will be strictly a religious observ
ance. Bishop O'Donaghue will be
present and all sympathizers with
the cause of Irish freedom are ex
pected to attend. The memory of
the men who were executed by the
British Government In Ireland Is
being thus commemorated In tho
churches throughout the country. In
Chicago memorial masses were cele
brated In not less than forty
churches this week.
REGULATES dancing.
The Right Rev. Denis O'Donag
hue, Bishop of Louisville, this week
received notice of the decree made
by Pope Benedict XV. forbidding
dancing at all picnics, entertain
ments and social functions given by
Catholic churches or by societies or
organizations for the benefit of any
religious Institutions under Catholic
auspices. The decree, which
merely Is the universal enforce
ment of tho legislation of the Third
Plenary Council of Baltimore, was"
dated at Rome, March 31. Dancing
as such is not forbidden, but dis
cipline requires all persons who
find-ln-anyvjsort- ot-danclng theoq
caslon of sin to refrain from the
practice. The decree from Rome
flow gives the prohibiten tho high
est sanction of the church and
makes Its enforcement compulsory
upon all Bishops and priests
throughout the whole world. Bishop
O'Donaghue said Tuesday night that
ho would Immediately direct all
pastors in the diocese to see that
the decree is strictly enforced.

Father Gasser had been talking to
Magistrate Frank Dacher, and when
he started across Broadway he was
struck and thrown about forty feet.
He was -at once removed to St.

Prisoners .have been taken from
nearly every county In Ireland and
on Juno 2 about 1,700 were still
confined in English prisons. The
list of names Is curious as shown in
the class and character of tho
revolutionists. In Richmond Bar
racks was confined a Count and
Countess, an Alderman, an editor, a
Marquis and several tramway work
ers. Justice Brereton, of Athlone,
who was made a prisoner by the
revolutionists at a barricade near
the Four Courts, made the follow
ing statement after his release:
"The revels were not out for
massacre, for burning, or for loot.
They were out for war, observing
all the rules of civilized warfare
and fighting clean. They fought
like gentlemen. They had posses
sion of tho restaurants stocked with
spirits, yet there was no Bign of
drinking. I was Informed that
they were all total abstainers. They
treated their prisoners with the
utmost courtesy in fact they
proved by their conduct what thoy
were men of education, incapable
of brutality."

EXECUTION OF IRISH UNJUST
That there is an anti-English
sentiment growing rapidly in the
United States there Is no doubt,
and It Is believed that knowledge
of this has caused President Wil
son to use strong words in his
iStestme6skge-toA-Englan(L.con
cernlng the rifling or our mails and
Interfeienco with American ship
ping. Despite the efforts of the
paid pro-English press it was
claimed In these columns since tho
outbreak of tho war that the
masses of the American people had
no love for England and that thoy
were utterly opposed to tho "hands
across the sea" policy advocated
by Henry Watterson and others of
the Carnegie Lecture Bureau. Tho
plea that England was the friend
of little nations, etc., fooled somo
of the people, who believed that
John Bull was Interested In Bel
glum for the latter's good, but the
policy of the British Government
In Its murder of tho Irish revolu
tionists exopsed the known brutal
ity which It has always practiced In
dealing with weaker nations or In
dividuals. Tho Christian Herald, a
Protestant publication, published at
the Bible Houso In New York City,
pretty near furnishes tho keynote
of public opinion In this country In
the following in Its latest Issue:
History records few acts so
stupid and so unjust as the lecent
wholesale executions of the leaders
of the Irish rebellion. Acts as un
just have been committed; acts
which weie In themselves as stupid.
But the stupidity of this act at this
particular time Is Immeasurable.
England and her allies have been
trying to make the world believe,
that they stand Tor a higher and
truer type of freedom than do their
enemies. - Sir Edward Grey, In a
long and careful Interview re
printed In a recent number of the
New York Times, states this claim
seriously and earnestly: That Eng
land Is fighting' for an Interna
tional method that shall end all
war nnd for a true and real type
of liberty. In claiming that this
has been the past spirit or Britain
Sir Edward appears for the moment
to have forgotten tho Transvaal, not
to go farther back than tho present
ceniury.
There are many pecullaily ugly
and distressing features in the
whole regrettable affair. First of
all, the men might have been
granted the consideration usually
extended to prisoners of war. This
was desirable from overy point of
view, rather than to remove them
with swift and savage slaughter.
Another shocking element was the
youth and puro idealism of the vic
tims. Patrick Pearse, President of
tho short-lived republic, was school
master, author and poet. Joseph
Plunkett, twenty-five years old, was
a poet and editor, a man of un
usual attainments as a scholar,
Daly was but twenty-four years old.
William Pearse, thirty years old,
was tutor and sculptor. O'Hanra
han was also an editor. F. Sheehy
Skefflngton, ono of tho victims,
seems to nave been entirely guilt
less of participation In the present
rebellion. Ho was also an editor,
and had resided for some tlmo in
America. Worst of all was the ad
mission In Parliament that Skefflng
ton and two other journalists had
been executed "without tho
knowledge of the military authori
ties, and before martial law was
actually in operation." Joseph
Plunkett was married a few hours
before his execution, his bride wear
ing widow's weeds. Heartrending
stories are told of the anguish of
mothers and wlve3 of tho executed
men. And many signs point to alto
gether unreasonable severity In has
tening tho executions,
Tho unwisdom of the British Gov
ernment's harsh methods with tho
Irish lebels lies not only In the fact
that it lessens her international
influence for Justice, liberty and
neace. but that It rnmirrorts nnd
I energizes In the people of her de
I pendencies the very thing she tries
to kill. It would seem that statcs-
men ought to realize by this time
' that you can not kill a movement
by killing Its leaders. This is what
Herod and Nero tried to do with
Christianity, but the blood that fell
from the necks of their victims be
came the seed from which hosts
of new believers arose, and In less
than three centuries. Instead of the
Roman Empire having conquered
Christianity Christianity had con
quered the empire. The method
hns been tried with scholars as well
as with saints, but history shows
that you do not kill a scientific or
sociological prlnclplo by killing the
men who teach It. And what Is
true of saints and scholars Is true
of patriots. To kill them -simply
produces more patriots. Of course
nations and races have been sub
dued and exterminated by whole
sale slaughter or overwhelming
military conquest, but to kill the
spirit of revolt by killing the lead
ers of revolt Is a thing that can
not be done.
As haB been clearly pointed out
recently by several scholarly writ
ers, the secret of universal peace
and brotherhood will come by ex
panding tho spirit of patriotism,
broadening It from province to na
tion, from nation to confederations
of nations, till It shall embrace all
tho world.
England has missed a rare chance
of sublimating Irish patriotism to
this broad and high purpose. Her
troubles with Ireland aro more
acute than ever. And she has added
a score of earnest faces and staunch
souls to the already crowded gallery
of Irish martyr-heroes.

Public At Large Not Enthusing
Over Teddy As A Presiden

THE LOCAL RACES NEXT YEAR
Political history Is being made
at Chicago this week and the date
marks the death or near death of
both Roosevelt and tho Progressive
party, his personal possession. As;
wo go to press It appears that the
Republican nomination lies between
Hughes and Roosevelt. If the for
mer Is given the nomination then
tho Progressive party will nominate
the Rough Rider and pursue the
wrecking policy of four years ago.
Then next November will bo the
date of the death of tho Bull
Moosers. In the event that Roose
velt is chosen by tho Republican
convention then the Progressive
party will be officially dead from
the time of the nomination, but its
demise will be postponed until next
November. Thursday morning it
was even money betting by tho
bookmakers that Roosevelt would bo
the Republican nominee and
Hughes was second choice In tho
betting at six to five. Tho shorter
odds against Teddy is accounted
for by tho fact that Democrats were
betting against him getting the
nomination, realizing that If they
lost there would still be a sliver
lining in the cloud, as they know
he would be an easy mark for
Wilson in the general election.
Conservative students of tho
political game see Roosevelt's finish
no matter what the outcome and
believe that he is following tho
same course pursued by Bryan In
tho Democratic party, and which
finally resulted in his ruin politi
cally. Roosovelt's dictatorial policy
of attempting to lully tho Hughes
supporters and the convention man
agers is tho samo tactics pursued
by Bryau. Just a few years ago a
Democrat in any State in tho Union
had to bear Bryan's O. K.Vbefore
.he, wag entitled to conslderatlta. as
a canuiuale, nis nrst quaimcauon
being proof that he had supported
the Boy Orator In 1896. This was
possible because of the support of
many rabid free sllverites every
where, and who can be likened to
the Bull Moosers who follow Roose
velt blindly today. Tho conserva
tive and thinking Democrats fi
nally obtained control and despite
Bryan's frantic efforts, grasping at
prohibition, woman suffrage and
other new themes, ho was relegated
to oblivion. This, then, is tho posi
tion of Roosevelt today. If chosen
by the Progressives ho Is doomed
and If chosen by the Republicans ho
Is doomed, as the thinking Republi
cans of the Old Guard do not be
lieve In a one-man party and will
scratch him with a vengeance. The
noisy rabble now marching through,
tho streets of Chicago cheering for
Teddy aro of not much assistance
In an election.
Turning to local politics, many
Domocrats bolleve with tho election
of Wilson assured a nomination in
4he party next year is equivalent to
election. In that connection several
Mayoralty bees are buzzing, among
them being Ben Washer, ex-Mayor
Head, Sheriff Charles Cronan, Peter
Lee Athortou, Caldwell Norton and
James B. Camp. County Attorney
Scott Bullitt has been picked as the
one best bet, following out tho or
iginal prediction made in these
columns over two yeais ago, but
thu3 far ho has turned a deaf car to
the suggestion. Messrs. Washer,
Camp and Head havo shown their
strength with tho public in elec
tions, the same applying to Sheriff
Cronan, who in his ono start ran
a bang up race, leading tho othor
first starters in both tho city and
county. It is believed that Charlie
Foster on account of his record will
have no opposition1 for Jailer, tho
same applying to Scott Bullitt for
County Attorney. Loraino Mix is
expected to try conclusions with
Judge Sam Greene for County
Judge, while leading politicians say
a strong dark horse is being
groomed for the other judgeship at
stake, Judge of tho Pollco Court,
against Judge Boldrick. Col. John
J. Barry Js pretty near a sure
starter for Sheriff, while Al Emler
Is talked of for County Assessor.
Thoro aro three County Commls
slqners to be chosen noxt fall and
four of the present Magistrates
Ijave been mentioned as entries
Squiro John O'Brien, Squire Frank
Dacher, Squiro Ben Schulman and
Squiro Charles Wheeler. There aro
two members of tho Board of Edu
cation to be chosen, and as tho ac
tion of tho board in its refusal to
allow a discount on its sharo of tho
taxes public opinion will bo against
endorsing members of tho present
board. One sure starter against tho
Incumbents isBen Kltng, who mado
such a memorable raco two years
ago, and he Is already In tho field.
