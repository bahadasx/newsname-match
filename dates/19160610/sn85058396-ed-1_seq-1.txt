onel Theodore Roosevelt in a commun
ication sent this morning to the Pro

Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts as a
cwnproinise candidate upon which
both Progressives and Republicans
could unite (
Colonel Roosevelt said that at about
five o'clock this morning he was noti
fied by the Progressive conferees that
they had come to no conclusion with
the Republican conferees and that the
Republican conferees had again ask
ed for any suggestion of a name as a
compromise candidate for the two
parties.
He then wrote to the Progressive
conferees saying ho deeply appreciat
ed their loyalty to him and their ef
forts to nominate him but that he had
thought the timo had come when car
rying out the spirit of tho statement
of the Progressive national committee
in January and tho statement made
by him In Trinidad in February, it
was their duty to present an alterna
tive name on which he hoped the Re
publicans and Progressives could
unite He presented the name of Hen
ry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts.
Lodge of Highest Integrity.
In his letter he stated that Mr.
Lodge had been a member of the low
er house of congress and of the sen
ate of the United States for thirty
years; that he was a man of the High
est Integrity, great farsightedness, aud
of wide vision as to national needs;
that he hnd been twenty years on the
foreign affairs committee of the sen
ate and had taken part in the moBt
important negotiations; that he had
fought vigorously In behalf of the navy
to upbuild it; that he had stood for
fortifying the Panama canal and had
favored in every way the upbuilding
of the array; that in addition to this
he had championed tho safety-appliances
bill for railroad men; the work
men's compensation act, the pure-food
law, and the anti-child labor bill, that
he (Roosevelt) meant every word he
had said in his recent speeches in his
Trinidad statement and in his tele
gram' to Senator JacKson the day
before yesterday ; that he had put !
the needs of the country as he saw
them, in the sentences quoted in his
letter to Mr. Jackson; that the nomi
nation of Senator Lodge would meet
these needs and that he asked the
Progressive conferees to stand by him
In making the deeds carry out his
work and that he trusted Lhat this
telegram would be read before both
conventions.
Coliseum, June 10. The following
communication trom Colonel Roose
velt was read by Mr. Perkins to the
Progresshe convention and by Sen
ator Smoot to the Republican con
vention: "To the conferees of tho Progres
sive party:
"Gentlemen I understand that this
morning you are to have your last
conference with the conferees of the
Republican national convention, that
they have repeatedly asked you' to pre
sent for their consideration a second
choice, but that 3rour committee has
not seen Its way clear to do this.
"For months I have thought of this
matter and for tho last few weeks
it has been the chief thing of which
I have thought as I feel with all my
heart that It is the imperative duty
of all of us. who wish to see our coun
try restorod to the position she should
hold, to sink all minor differences
and come together if by any possibil
ity we can find a common standing
ground. The day before yesterday in
mv telegram to Senator Jackson I
sa'ld 'can we not, forgetting past dif
ferences go forth in safety and honor
OL OUT country lO tmurtu lug jjvuv.iv.-o
of genuine Americanism and genuine
preparedness. Surely we can afford
to act in accordance with the word3
of Abraham Lincoln when he said:
'May not all, having a common inter
est, Te-unlte fix a common effort to
save our common country-' May we
ask thoso who have not differed with
us to join in the same spirit toward
those who have. As far as my soul is
known to me it is in this same spirit
that at this time I make my appeal
to tho Republicans and Progressives
assembled at Chicago."
"What I then said I meant with all
my soul and I mean It now; and I
ask you and the members of the Pro
gressive convention, which I am in
formed applauded that telegram when
read to the convention, now to help
make those words good by your deeds.
"I deeply appreciate your loyalty to
me and tho position in support of mo
which you have taken. But It would
me an injustice both to you and my
self not to regard that loyalty to me
as fundamentally a loyalty to the
.principles you and I represent. In
the statement of the Progressive na
tional convention issued in January
last and my statement made at Trini
dad in February last in which we
pledged ourselves to leave nothing
undone to reach an honorable agree
ment with the Republicans in order to
