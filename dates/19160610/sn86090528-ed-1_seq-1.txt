hi ramble to get aboard the Hughes
band wagon. The selection came af-
ter Roosevelt, had made an effort to
swing both parties to Senator Lodge
as a compromise candidate.

about the hall led by California. An
ear-splitting din was raised to t lie roof
of the Coliseum.
The supporters of Weeks voted for
Hughes. The selection of Hughes
was made unanimous on motion

candidates this morning before the
opening of today's session of the Re
publican convention conceded that Jus
tie.' Hughe would be nominated as
the presidential candidate by two bal
lots at most.
Sherman's release of the Illinois del
egates to Hughes H expected to cause
similar action by Burton of Ohio, ac
cording to one campaign manager,
and many Cummins delegates are ex
pected to do likewise, giving Hughes
four hundred and thirty-nine and one
half votes or one hundred and sixty
five over his total in the balloting last
night.
Four hundred and ninety-tour votes
are necessary to nominate. It is ex
pected that the additional vote needed
to put Hughes over will come from va
rious other candidates, such a Root,
Weeks, Fairbanks ami Roosevelt.

ilny but George W. Perkins culled tin;
delegation of which he is chairman in
to conference, usking them wliat terms

tions of dissension In the Moose
ranks, believing they had lost an ad
vantage by failing to nominate Koose

AUSTRIANS
By Uuitct' Press.
Petrograd, June 10. The Russians
captured seventy-eight thousand Aus
trians, exploding shrapnel beh'nd them
in such quantities that the enemy was
unable to retreat, according to advices
received today.
The Austrian ca-suallicH are conserv
atively estimated at one hundred and
fifty thousand in the Russian drive
through Hie carefully prepared de
fenses before Pruth, which it required
months to build.
Disregarding entanglements and
(lunging recklessly, the Slav forces
were quick to improve the advantages
gained in their first furious onslaughts,
by bringing up their artillery.
It is estimated that seven hundred
thousand Aestrians are defending the
line along which heavy fighting is now
in progress. The Russians have ad
vanced tweniy-two miles in two days
in their movement toward Onlyka and
fourteen miles toward Stanislau.

U.S. TO SIT
TIGHTER ON
LIQUOR LID
Drastic Provision Added to Dry Law by
Congress; Mere Possession Made
Prima Facie Evidence of
Unlawful Act
WILL BE ENFORCED
SAYS LINEBAUGH
Measure Approved by President Wilson in
May and is Now Effective; Marshal
Dillon Serves Notice, Giving
Warntng
Muskogee, June In. "Enforcement
of theprovision of the new Indian ap
propriation bill that possession of In
toxicating lbjuort) shall be considered
prima facie evidence of unlawful pos
session begins right now," said Unit
ed Stales District Attorney D. llayden
. Linchaugh.
i ue provisions oi uns siaiuie win
be enforced in that portion of this dis-
trict which was formerly Indian Ter
ritory.", Handling of the liquor situation in
the Indian country is made a great
ideal easier and nior effective by the
addition of a few words to the Indian
bill providing for the schools, agen
cies and other affairs. The clause
reads: .
"The provisions of sections M0 and
21 IP of the revised 'statutes of the
United. States shall also apply to beer
in the act of January lit), &!I7 (2!i stat.
L, page 5Ut!) and the possession by ii
person of intoxicating liquors in the
country where the introduction is pro
hibited by treaty or federal statute
shall he prima facie evidence of un
lawful introduction." 1
Presidont Wilson approved the
measure May IS and it is in effect.
Mr. Linebaugh says the duty of en
forcement falls upon any officer of tin;
United States in this jurisdiction. H is
not merely a matter for the special
enforcement service under direction of
the interior department, but is a regu
lar duty ofsthe department of justice,
represented by the district attorney's
office and the marshal's force.
The government heretofore has been
forced to prove the fact of introduc
tion in order to make a case stick.
Now the finding of liquor in a place
of business or in personal possession
of anyone known to he a bootlegger or
suspected of bootlegging will mean
prosecution. It will not be necessary
to show when or where the liquor was
run over the line or that it is intended
for sale. The liquor itself will be
plenty of evidence, officers believe.
There are deputy marshals all over
eastern Oklahoma and there are sev
eral special enforcement men on duty
in this section. Early results seem to
be inevitable. J
"Look Out," Says Dillon.
Commenting on the new provision
of the prohibitory law and the district
attorney's decree concerning its en
forcement, Deputy U. S. Marshal Dil
lon said today. "I want everybody to
understand the situation. It will be
my purpose to enforce the law as the
district attorney interprets it and all
should take notice and bo governed
accordingly. Proof of the mere pos
session of liquor is sufficient evidence
i' pou which to convict and all persons
arrested in the future will be amena
ble to the new law."
