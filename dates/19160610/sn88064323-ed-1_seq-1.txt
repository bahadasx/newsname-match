DISEASE DESCRIBED
IN NEW CIRCULAR.
Press Bulletin.
Every citrus fruit grower in
Louisiana should have a copy of
C ircular Mo. 15, entitled Citrus
Canker, which has just been is
sued by the Extension Division of
the Louisiana State University.
This circular disousses the orig.
in and distribution of the citrus
canker, the appearanoe of the dia
ease, the varieties affected, the
cause 'of the diaeaae, bow it ia
spread, etc. It also discusses the
eradication of this diaeaae- and
shows this oan be done only by
baruing the infected trees.
The growers of citras fruits
should do all in thsir power to
help the cânker eradication work..
They are the ones who will profit
by the work, and, on the other
hand, It will be their loss if the
canker is not eradicated. Home
of the things the growers and
those interested in the orange in
dustry should do may be briefly
enumerated, as follows:
1. Keep out of the groves,
stay as ay from all citras trees
sud do not allow animals to run
in the ore bards. Do not allow
visitors in yonr orchards. Indi
vidnals with canker cures should
be invited to stay away The
only persons who shonld be per.
mitted to go near the trees ate
the inspectors who have obarge of
the eradication work.
2 It is very dangerous to set
oat citrus stock of any kind until
the canker is ander complete oon
trol. To plant oitras stock at the
present time will only help to
complicate a serions situation and
is liable to spread the disease.
8- Be earefnl in picking trait.
The disease can be spread very
easily by fruit piokers. If there
is canker present in the neighbor
ho#d inspec'ors shonld be con
suited in regard to piokmg the
fruit.
4. Help the inspectors as
much as possible In their work.
Ibis can be done by giving them
informa* ion regarding oitras
plantings in the locality and by
rendering them any deaired as
sistance while they are inspecting.
Remember at all times tbat tbs
oitras industry depends opon the
eradication of the oanker. If the
canker is eradicated Louisiana
ean become an important oitror*
growing state; otherwise, there is
little hope of the industry.

THE RELIGION
OF REVOLUTION:
By Rev Herbert S Bigelow.
It was in 1827 that the Necreta
ry of the United Slates Tteasury
declared that it would take five
hundred years to settle our vast
domain. It. may take that long
to settle it, but in these few years
if it has not all been settled it has
»II beeu seized. So tbat today,
while two thirds of it is idle,
practically all of it is owned As
a result we have not a free but an
unnatural competition where pent
up men on a monopolized earth,
must chase each other round and
round the ring of their prison for
the few jobs their landlords are
willing to grant Ihr in. instead
of destroying monopoly and rais
mg wages, so that the American
people can be their own market,
we are already beginning to de
mand markets abroad where we
may sell the products of American
labor which American laborers
can not but; so our jingo states
men stand up in the halls of Con
gress, and talk of our coining
fight for trade with the rising pow
ers of China and Japan, if we
were to plan intelligently for that
contest with China and Japan, if
we wete to prepare—not with
growing armaments nor braggart
navies—if we were to prepare for
it by solving our domestic prob
letns, by abolishing poverty and
draining off our slums, the froz
eu peaks of Shasta and Ranier
might be left to guard aloue out
Western shore, for no yellow host
would ever come to try our
strength.
America exploited and armed is
the ideal of a false patriotism!
To be free is to be thrice armed.
Let America conquer herself and
lead the world into the paths of
justice and peace. ,
In our veins runs the blood of
all the peoples of Earth who have
hated oppression and demanded
liberty. Why was this mighty
continent reserved for us, the lov
ers of freedom from all landsf
What is our destiny? Dare we be
lieve tbat a new hour is striking
in the history ot the world, that
we are the chosen nation to break
the bauds of all the centuries and
follow the shining way to freedom!
Suppose that faith should take
possession of usf Suppose the na
tion would become intoxicated
with that divine purpose! What a
religion that wonld be!
"Had uot the founders ot Amer
ica some such great purpose in
view when one of the most gifted
of those talented men wrote:
"Jn a chariot of light from the regions
of day
The Goddess of Liberty came
Tan tnousaod celestials directed the
And hither conducted the dame."
And did not France have this
object and dream of America's fu
ture in view—when she presented
to- ns the Goddess of Liberty
holding aloft the Torch of Reason
to enlighten the world!

WAGES PAID PER HOUR
What a man receives per hoar
is the only proper basis for dis
enssing wages. The following ta
bie shows the prevailing wages
received per hoar by freight crews
aB compared to other trades:
Locomotive engineers......48£c
Bricklayers, plasterers, etc..75c
Locomotive firemen........die
Carpenters, painters etc.... 70c
Freight conductors.........40c
Laborers in tunnels, wells etc 57 jo
Freight brakemeo.............26.7c
Excavating laborers.......40c
Are these high wages when yon
eoosider the responsibility and
skill required of freight train
men!
Excessive hoars and the terri
ble strain shatters the health and
shortens the lives of these men.
The employes are not asking
for more pay, only that their
working hours be made less.
Tbsy desire relief from the
present arduous working condi
tions so that their time at home
will be lengthened and their
chance of relaxation improved.

SOUTHERN LEGISLATOR
GOMPARES - WOMEN
TO SETTER PUPS
----
a remarkable illustration of
! prejudice and discourtesy was ex
hibited at the Hearing on the suf
frage bill in the Louisiana legis
lature The ebaitmau of die
committee was stone-deaf, and ac

at the close of the Heating by tin
astonishing statement, "I have
not heard a word you women have
said, but I'm opposed to jour re
marks!" Then he proceeded to de
liver a tirade against woman suf.
frage, and compared the women
to a lot of "setter pups". The
ladies present at the Hearing
were among the best known and
representative women of Louisi
ana. Iu answer to the legislator
I lie following official protest was
promptly issued:
"The Louisiana State Woman
Suffrage Association protests

At the hearing Mr Dupre com.

opinion Mr. Dupre has formed of

TELLING THE TRUTH.
Review Bulletin.
It is not pleasant and profitable
always to tell the truth in the
columns of a newspaper. Men
who have tried this heretofore
have always come to grief. Only
a few days ago the editor of a 'pa.
per in Indiana grew tired of being
called a liar, and announced tbat
be would tell the truth in the fu
ture; and the next issue of the
paper contained the following
items: »
"John Bonin, the laziest man in
town, made a trip to Belleville
yesterday.
"John Ooyle, oar grocerman, is
doing a poor business. His store
is dirty and dusty. How oan he
do mnebf
"Rev. Styx preached last Sun
day night on 'Charity." The ser
mon was punk.
"Dave Sonkey died at bis home
in this place. The doctor gave it
ont as heart failare. Whiskey
killed him.

Washington, May — Shoe black
ing owes its peculiar aromatic
odor, faintly suggestive of the
deep woods where spruce or hem
lock needles pad the ground, to
an oil which is manufactured
from these same kinds of needles.
Similar oils are obtained from the
foliage and small twigs of various
cone bearing trees, and find use
for a number of purposes. In
Europe the finer of these oils are
use extensively as perfume in
soap. They ate common compo*
neats of liniments snd other medi
cinal preparations. Cedar oil is
chiefly used in the preparation of
insecticides, and, to some extent,
in making liniment.
