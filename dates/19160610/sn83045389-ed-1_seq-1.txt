PARIS. June 9 ?The fall of Fort
Vaux, with its gallant little band of
defenders, Is deeply regretted, but pub
lic opinion is not discouraged.
? The withdrawal of the French line to
the Inner defenses of Verdun, on the
right bank of the Meuse, which was
forecasted by military writers as a
natural consequence <d the capture of'
Vaux, has not yet taken place. The
French have resisted the furious and
repeated efforts of the enemy to compel
this retirement. Violent onslaughts,
both In the Thiaumont region and on i
the trenches in the vicinity of Vaux
were made by the Germans in the last
twenty-four hours, but. according to :
the latest reports received bv the
French War Ofti.e, all of these attacks
wore repulsed.
By a week of uninterrupted attacks,,
in which it is said a number of divi
sions were destroyed, the Germans ;
have advanced their linen about one!
mile. They have taken the southern !
part of Caillette wood, part of the
Chapitre wood. Damloup village and
now Vaux Fort. In past wars the ,
enemy's progress on the right would '
have compelled the French to fall back
automatically from the Pouaumont-j
Thlaumont lines, but under the present j
conditions it has been found that such
a saw-toothed front can be held.,. The
French found this to their disadvan
tage In the great Champagne offensive.
Before the enemy will be aide to make
full use of his week's conquests, he
will have to enlarge his front, by the |
, capture of Souville Fort. This fort,
?crowns a height of ,1SS meters, which .
is situated to the southwest. Its guns
sweep the line of the crests running j
from Vaux to Douaumont, and its !
seizure will bo a hard task, which will j
entail desperate lighting and heavy j
sacrifices.

Five days of furious offensive by

Roosevelt Assumes
Personal Direction
Plans Moves for Progressives |
7 o-Day Over Long-Dis
lance Telephone.
OYSTEH BAY. June 9.?Immediately .
after the adjournment of the Republi- I
i i
j can convention to-night. Colonel Koose- !
| velt assumed personal direction of the 1
progressive convention over the long
distance telephone. He expected to bo
up most, of the night making plans for
to-morrow.
Colonel Roosevelt kept in close touch
with the balloting in Chicago, and ap
peared well pleased with the result of
the second ballot, which left Hughes
far short of enough delegates to win
the nomination. He feels that the
Hughes adherents will not be able to
gain further strength, and seemed to
attach significance to the fact that it
was Senator Penrose who moved for
an adjournment. !
It is the belief of Colonel Roosevelt 1
that the maximum of Hughes's strength
was reached on the second ballot, and j
' that his own chances of getting the '
nomination were thereby increased.
Colonel Roosevelt still refused to- j
night to indicate his attitude in regard j
>t'o a separate ticket by the l'rogres- !
1 sives. It is the general opinion here,
however, that unless the Republicans:
"show a spirit of accommodation," the ?
Progressives undoubtedly will place a '
third ticket in the field.

?Theodore Roosevelt will be nomi- ;

Progressive Xation.'il Convention. unless
there is some political miracle ? an
agreement between its conferees and
those from the Republican convention
or direct, emphatic word from Mr. j
Roosevelt himself that the Progressive
nomination would not be accepted.
For hours to-day the le.-ifWs of the'
convention staved off a nomination that
they knew, and every delegate in the
hall know, jvas crowding forward with
the hours themselves and could no
more be stopped than an avalanche, if
once the convention was assured that
the last hope of peace was gone and
Mr. Roosevelt's nomination at the
Coliseum could not be accomplished.
After^three sessions that ran through
the gamut of emotions from hysteria!
for Mr. Roosevelt to a calm.^dispassion- j
ate discussion of planks in the plat- !
form, the convention adjourned at 0:."iS
to-night until 10:30 to-morrow.

It w as only after repeateri assurance i
from the leaders that Colonel Roose
velt himself desired that the nomina- !
tion b.? postponed and oratory that!
played upon their good nature that the
'''?ideates swallowed their own convic
tions that the nomination was the real!
and only business to be considered and
consented to quit the hall for the night.
All day the delegates kept on euard
while the leaders watched or listened
ova.- the telephone to detect any unex
pected move by the Republicans. As
the ballots were taken in the Coliseum
they waited and listened and kept their
tempers. . j
They were told they must "keep the
faith" and allow two ballots to be'
taken by the Republicans, according to!
the agreement between the peace con-'
ferees and approved by Colonel Roose-!
velt himself. The approval of the Colo-1
nel was a trump card held up the
sleeves of the leaders, but never played, j
tor when the Coliseum quit for the.
night the delegates, tired out with long1
sitting in the hot. sticky theater, were'
billing to wait for a nomination.
"Twenty-four hours won't make any
difference." said Governor Hiram John
son. The crowd agreed, and accepted
the motion, to adjourn.
PROHIBITION PL A Si K
KOII PLATFORM DEFEATED
There was little routine business dur
ing the day. The platform was tenta
tively agreed upon with only a few
changes. A flcht to insert a" prohibi
tion plank was beaten by a vote of
?>23 to S2, after the leaders had ex
plained at length that to put it in j
meant that prohibition, and not Amer- ?
lean ism, would then bee me the main !
Issue.
For the rest the delegates just
cheered and listened. Realizing that
an outbreak might be averted only by
K :oping them in good humor, the lead
ers recognized man after man in the I
hall, called them to the platform and i
allowed them to play on the crowd's ;
good nature and* its sense, of humor. i
Before adjournment the delegates I
were told of the results of the first two
ballots at the Coliseum. They took
comfort from the vote for Mr. Roose
velt. and the motion to end the session
was unopposed.
One of the incidents of tne day, and
one of the most dramatic, was the
sudden appearance upon the platform
of Senator Borah, of Idaho, a delegate
to the Republican convention, and one
of the peace conferees. He got a re
ception that rose to the high ceiling of
the theater and swelled out into the
streets, but when he began to speak,
the old temper for Roosevelt Darned
out again
The Senator spoke briefly; he hoped
for harmony and peace and the spirit
of get-together, but he promised to
follow Mr. Roosevelt with all the ardor
he was capable of if he should be the
nominee of the two parties.

The Maine delegation started another

WASHINGTON, June 9.?Anti-Amer
ican demonstrations in Northern Mex
ico continue, according to official ad
vices to-day, particularly in the States
of Chihuahua, San Luis Potosi and
Nuevo Leon, and consular agents have
reported that the temper of the people
appears -uch that any eventuality
might be possible. Americans are leav
ing for the border in steadily increas
ing numbers, and border agents have
been instructed to urge those seeking
to return to Mexico not to do so, but
to remain on the American side of the [
border for the present. Officials here j
showed considerable uneasiness over j
the situation.
A mass-meeting was held at Saltillo !
last night, at which many speeches t
resenting the presence of American 1
troops in Mexico were made. Similar ,
meetings have been held or are con- J
templatud at other points. The only j
violence against American property re
ported was at Chihuahua City and
Monterey, where there are no consular
agents.
Statements from Americans reaching
the border, and also from consular i
agents in Mexico, have indicated that
while General Carranza's forces were
trying to ovaj-awe the demonstrators, \
their control was not to be depended j
on entirely in some districts.
Army officials have no fears for the.
safety of the American expedition. It
it so closely concentrated as to be
fully able to defend itself in any
emergency, and also to lend efficient
protection to a wide stretch of the

"Favorite Sons"LooJi
to Sagamore Hill for
Aid Against Hugh es
Last Stand of Allies Or
dered, in Effort to Win
Nomination for One
of Their Number.
CHICAGO. Juno 10.?The last stand
of the allies against the Hughes forces, ?
which threaten to sweep the He- J
publican convention to-day, has been
ordered. With more than a majority
of the delegates still pledged to their
colors, steps were taken at midnight
to guard against desertions. Optimis
tic statements were circulated, based
on the ability of the combination of
favorite sons to adjourn yesterday's ses
sion before proceeding with a third
ballot, which, if taken, almost certainly
would have made Justice Hughes the
nominee.
The plans of the combination were
guarded with the utmost secrecy, but
it was necessary for the. leaders to
take so many persons into their con
fidence that it became known that tho
allies looked to Sagamore Hill for the
re-enforcement needed to make victory
theirs. A word from Colonel Roose
velt, they all seemed to think, would
end the chance of a nomination of
Hughes, and his approval of an ally
would give that candidate strength to
Ko before the convention to-day with
at least a show to get a nomination.

The leaders in the combination were
managers of the candidacies of Fair
banks. Weeks and Burton, but it was
hoped to enlist all of the other allied
candidacies, Sherman, Hoot. Cummins,
Knox and those with a scattered fol
lowing. The advocates of the nomina
tion of Fairbanks were the most in
sistent, because he was the only one
of the allies who made a gain on the
second ballot at the Coliseum. All of
them agreed, however, that if Colonel
Hoosevelt should make a selection of
some other candidate, they would abide
by his decision and do their utmost to
nominate that man.
Former Senator Root figures promi
nently in the plans of the combination,
as many of tho political leaders op
posed to the nomination of Hughes
argued that, they must consider the
supposed ambition of Colonel Roose
velt to get the Republican nomination
in 1920, if It is denlod in 1916. On ac

MAY <;o IX HOI)Y TO
SITPORT OF III.'fill ICS
The greatest element of doubt in the
situation concerns the supporters of
Cummins, of Iowa, and La Kollette, of
Wisconsin, because of their Progressive
tendencies. When released from their
pledges, these delegates, the favorite
sou men think, will go in a body to
the support of Justice Hughes.
The llughes forces profess not to lie
alarmed by reports that the favorite
sons were organizing for a tight against
the justice. Their optimism was based
on their belief that many of the in
structed delegates cannot be trans
ferred at will from one allied candi
date to another, and that by any swaps
attempted Hughes Is bound to gain
strength. They repeated their claims
that Hughes would be nominated, they
thought, on the (list ballot to-day, and
certainly not later than the second,
which would be the fourth taken by the
convention.
As the night wore on meager details
of the anti-Hughes conferences became
known. George W. jf'erklns, of the
Progressive convention, Senator Pen
rose and a number of others met early.
The spokesman for the Republican
faction convinced Mr. Perkins that be
cause of personal prejudices against
Colonel Roosevelt, held by many of the
delegates, chiefly on account of the
Colonel leaving the party four years
ago, he could not under any circum
stances gather more than 350 votes in
the Republican convention, in which
194 votes is a majority.
Mr Perkins told the Republican
members of the conference that next to
nominating Colonel Roosevelt, he de
