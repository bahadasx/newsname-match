GOOD ROADS.
(;oo4d weather and go(xl roads
are great inducements to aultolo
bile owners to be out and seeing
the country. we noticed here last
Sunday a large number of auto
mobiles from neighboring towns.
(Our roads are not the best, but
they are as gotl and we Ibelieve
better than those of Iberia parish,
we mean the road from the parish
line to JIeanerette.
Their roads to Salt Mine and
Loreauville are good dirt roads.
St. Martin parish has a few pieces
of good roads, but they have been
generally neglected and some of
them have heed kept up by private
money.
We hope, however, that the new'
Police Jury will have the means
to give more attention to our roads
