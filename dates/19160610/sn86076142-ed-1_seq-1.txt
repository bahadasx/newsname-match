OYSTKR BAY, June 10. Roosevelt has retired to the seclusion
of his home denying himself to reporters. According to friendo the
colonel is believed to be trying to decide what r-2 regards as the
momentous question of his career, wheiiier to head a third party in

dates. The impression is growing that he will become the Progres
sive candidate if the Republicans do not nominate him.

THE NOMINATION IE HUGHES IS DEEMED SHTISPSCT0RY
It was everywhere considered a landslide for Hughes. The conven
tion adjourned to 2 o'clock.
The moment when it waa flashed to the Progressive convention
that Hughes had been nominated by the Republicans, Robins was an
nouncing to the cheering Progressives that Roosevelt had been chosen
by acclamation for their standard bearer. The convention again
went wild when Robins mentioned the necessity of nominating a vice
president and delegates shouted "Johnson's tubman." The conven
tion recessed to 3 o'clock this afternoon.
The reading of a letter from Roosevelt which referred to a state
ment issued mentioned Lodge as a compromise had no influence on
the delegates who were determined on the name of Roosevelt and no
Other. A message was sent to Roosevelt at Oyster Bay "notifying him,
but no reply as yet lias been received, whether he will accept or what
action he would take. It is believed he will head a third party.
Throughout the convention it was noticed that the Progressives
had little sympathy with the movement of the leaders to reach a
peace agreement with the Republicans, but were determined to
have Roosevelt.

wife and child visited a neighbor, who
was intending to depart this morn
ing. George Komjenovch waa aBleep
in bed the time the fire started. One
of the neighbors saw flames In the
front part of the house and rushed
in and called the sleeping man, who
did not have time to dress. In less
than five minutes, every room was
burning furiously on account of this ra
pidity, nothing could be saved. Over

A chemical stream directed by fire
men, who wrapped wet blankets about
their heads and dashed in between the
two homes, was able to handle the sit
uation by smothering the flames of
the residence owned by Jack Olllman,
holstman at the Victor. His damage
is nominal and is not covered by in
surance. The fire department did not appear
to have any informatloln about tbe lo
cation of hydrana for the connection
waa made at the Harrington House,
1000 feet away, when an Idle plug
stood within a block of the fire. Had
it not been for the fact mat the burn
ed house was aided with tin sheeting
and there was not a breath of wind
there would not have been, much re
maining of Belmont avenue thia
morning.
