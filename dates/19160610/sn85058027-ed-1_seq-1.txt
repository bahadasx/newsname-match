Air. Ferlin also said that he
was remodeling the old board
ing house, so as to give uo
comodations to the increased
force and to provide for an
assay office.
The Dutchman and Pacific
combined have employed an
assayer and an engineer who
will bn stationed at the Dutch
man stendily to keep the man
agement posted on the grade
of ore being extracted, and to
run levels, etc., in the proper

convenience for others desir

I The Pacific Fissure
I RECENT HISTORY INDICATES THAT IT WILL FORM A
ORESCENT AND PROVE TO BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST
ORE CHANNELS IN THE STATE.

H Goldfield famous.
