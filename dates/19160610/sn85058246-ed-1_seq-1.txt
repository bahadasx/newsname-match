W CHAUTAUQUA
H Lou J. Beauehamp, the original'
9 humorous philosopher, Is captioned!
9 Tho thinker who makes you lauRli,
H nd the humorist who makes you
H think. No enfgram could bo moro up-
proprlated, Mr. Deauclmmp la a vcr
H ' bal dynamo charged with sunshine.
lie Is packed with tough flbered
words that hit. Ho shoots pliraECs
with a kick In. them. But hla rapier
H llko thrusts simultaneously flash Inn
I and pierce truth. Ho will put n crip
I in a gathering of tho most emus
complaccnco.
Every time Lou Heauchamp turns
nn nudlcnce Into a smtlo ho 'lays a
thought In the wrinkle. Ho does not
drag his lnlmltahlo stories In by tho
car. They aro part of tho capsule
the sugar coating to soma pretty
fcttlf pills. Ho Is a .benevolent sur
geon though, his good cheer being
the only anaesthetic required by his
patients.
Heauchamp preaches tho gospel ot
sunshine and love. He believes that
life Is a glorious thing not tho life
that you can buy, at any ncwsstnnl
for a dime, but tho eternal reality
cf the verb to bo, Ho is a xorry
blotter.
His Sunshine Lecture will ewinor
ato all your tears. Every word is a
radiant ray of hope overythought a
lesson and a comfort. His enthusi
asm is as catching as the measles,
and if you do not -want to bo took
with an unconquerablo optimism
B ' Veep away from Beachamp.

chances for tho amalgamation of thu H
Progressives nnd tho Republicans Is i H
not ns good as tho lenders- of theso !WH

that thcro Is no common ground on jBI
which the Progressives enro to JAIn UH
with the Republicans except through Hl
the nomination of Theodoro 'Roosc- 11
volt ns thu standard bearer of both B H
pntrles to head tho ticket an tho jj H
pt evidential nominee. To this, hdw- Mi H
ever, the Republicans will not con- it
cede. An effort w'as being inaile all H
('.ny jentorday through tho various MllB

union of the divided parties. SII
Notwithstanding tho fact that an jj M
effort 1h being mado to bring togeth- m H
9r these two great national parties, R M
