OFFICIAL NEWS OF CITY AND COUNTY
STATE INSTITUTIONS.
Being oiie of a series of 12 spe
cial articles for the Examiner,
prepared by W. H. Cochran, mem
ber 1 of the state board of control.
The legislature of 1913 created a
State School for Girls and ordered
that as soon as the new site was se
lected and new buildings constructed
at the institution, the girls then in
the State Training School at Che
halls should be transferred to it.
When this session of the legisla
ture created this Institution, it did a
very wise thing, as it brought segre
gation between the boys and girls
and made it possible for much to be
accomplished with the latter.
The governor was empowered to
appoint four electors of the state,
two of whom were to be women, who
together with the members of the
State Board of Control, should select
a site for the school, to consist of not
mor« than 160 acres, and it was stip
ulated that the site should be with
in a radius of not less than one mile
and not more than ten # miles
from the State Training School at
Chehalis.
The legislature ordered that the
cottage plan should be followed in
the construction and arrangement of
the buildings, as far as practicable,
each cottage to provide a group of
not to exceed thirty girls.
It was provided that the superin
tendent and all subordinate officers
of the school should lie women, un
less a married woman should be ap
pointed superlnetndent or to any
subordinate position, when the hus
band of such appointee may, with
the consent of the board, be allowed
to reside at the institution.
Any girl more than ten and under
eighteen years of age, who has been
found delinquent under the juvenlte
delinquency law of the state, may be
committed by the court to the State
School for Girls., there to remain un
til twenty-one years of age, unless
sooner paroled or discharged.
The Board of Control, acting with
the superintendent shall, under a
system of marks, or otherwise, fix
upon a uniform plan by which girls
may be paroled or discharged from
the school', which system can be re
vised at any time. Each girl shall
be credited for personal demeanor,
diligence in labor or study and for
the results accomplished, and charg
ed for dereliction, negligence or of
fense. The standing of each girl
shall be made known to her as often
as once a month.
Every girl shall be entitled to a
trial on parole before reaching the
age of twenty years, such parole to
continue for at least one year unless
violated. The superintendent and
resident physician, with the approval
of the Broad of Control, shall deter
mine whether such parole has been
violated. Any girl committed to the
school who shall escape therefrom,
or who shall violate a parole, may
be apprehended and returned to the
school by any officer or citizen on
written order or request of the su
perintendent. Any person who shall
go upon the school grounds except
on lawful business, or by consent of
the superintendent, or who shall en
tice any girl away from the school,
or who shall in any way interfere
with its management or discipline,
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
No girl is permitted to be received
in the State School for Girls who Is
not of sound mind, or who is subject
to epileptic or other fits, or is not
possessed of that degree of bodily
health which should render her a fit
subject for the discipline of the
school. It is made the duty of the
court committing her to cause such
girl to be examined by a reputable
physician to be appointed by the
court, who will certify to the above
facts, which certificate must be for
warded to the school with the com
mitment.
Teachers are employed, aB far as
practicable, to Instruct the girls In
list Is signed by both employer and
all of the branches usually taught in
the grades of the common schools of
the state, also in such trades and vo
cational occupations as may be found
desirable. The educational work of
the school was made a part of the
educational system of the state, and
as such is under the supervision of
the State Board of Education. Only
those certified by the State Superin
tendent of Public Instruction can be
employed as teachers.
The superintendent has power to
place any girl under the age of eigh
teen years at any employment for ac
count of the Institution or the girl
employed and receive and hold the
whole or any part of her wages for
the benefit of the girl lets the
amount necessary for her board and
keep, and may aUo, with the consent
of any girl over fourteen years of
age, aid the approval of tbe Board
of Control, endorsed thereon, execute
Indentures of apprenticeship, which
shall be binding on all parties. In
case any girl so apprenticed shall
prove untrustworthy or unsatisfac
tory, the superintendent may permit
her to be returned to the school, and
the Indenture may thereupon be can
celled.
The commission appointed to se
lect the site for the State School for
Girls selected a property situated
about half a mile from Grand
Mound, in Thurston county. About
forty acres of the land was level
prairie, suitable for a building site,
and for early gardening, and the bal
ance lies about twenty-five feet lower
ami is composed of rich bottom land.
The Chehalls river runs along the
west side of the property for about
sixteen hundred feet. A beautiful
little lake, fed by springs, covering
about three acres of land Is located
on the property near the buildings.
The Board of Control immediately
proceeded with the erection of two
modern cottages to take care of the
girls. The buildings constructed
were modern in every respect. The
foundations are of concrete, and a
visit to this part of the building is a
pleasure. A well equipped domestic
science department is not only a
training of a practical nature, but
the resultant is a need of the house
hold and constitutes part of the do-
Beittc economy.
In ilie laundry, water motors oper
ate the washing machines, this de
partment again being operated as a
school along the lines that washing
is done in the majority of house
holds. Girls with axes are busy
splitting and piling wood, and it is
piled wood, not a pile of wood.
Tools of all kinds have a place in
these basements, and the tools are In
their places, clean and ready for
their next use. Ideas embodied in
the construction of these buildings
certainly ought to make toward re
formation.
The first noticeable thing upon
entering the office is a rack filled
with government bulletins dealing
with farm work. These are being
studied and the experience contained
therein put to use.
The fundamental provision, archi
tecturally, is privacy. Every girl has
her own room, or will have, that be
ing the intention of the legislature
when it established the school. At
the present tine there are two girls
in most of the rooms, and three in
some. The rooms, while small, are
light, well ventilated and more in
viting than the great majority of ho
tel rooms. Each room la, in fact, a
veritable little home; pictures of the
loved ones at home, and fancy work
adorn the walla and dressers. If re
formation is not possible here, It can
not be effected.
The great idea around which thin
institution is building in love for one
another, love and respect for the su
perintendent and her officers, love
of nature and a growing conviction
that they are all equals, not only of
one another, but also of the great
army of humanity outside of the
walls. If anyone doubts the fact that
this effect Is being wrought, spend an
evening in this big family. The one
ureat factor that makes for good cit
izenship is their home life, work
(and hard work) out of doors, In
dustry at all times, as shown by ev
ory girl knitting, sewing, etc., and
play devised and managed along
moral and healthy lines are the daily
routine.
In the evenings the girls gather in
the large living rooms, where they
work on their own fancy work, some
one reads aloud for an hour, the rest
of the evening is spent listening to
music on the Vlctrolas, playing the
piano, einglng or playing games. In
one cottage alone 32 books were
read aloud in the evenings during
the past year. Such books as: "Da
vid Copperfleld," and others of Dick
ens; "Laddie and Freckles," "Girl
of the Limberlost," "Michael O'Hal
loran," "Polly Anna," "The Wonder
ful Adventures of Nils," "Paul An
tony, Christian," "The Rebecca Stor
ies," "The Dawn of Tomorrow,"
Kipling's "Just So" stories, "The
Leaven of Love," "Polly of the Hos
pital Staff," "Mary Carey," "Bob,
Son of Battle," "The Boss of Little
Arcady," etc.
The beautiful piano was a gift
from the Mothers' Congress and Par-
ent-Teachers' association of Seattle.
Two Victrolas, one for each cottage,
were presented to the girls by Mr.
and Mrs. E. C. Blanchard, of the Nor
thern Pacific. A I'kelele was the gift
of Mrs. R. F. Frlnger, of Seattle.
The last legislature made provis
ion for another cottage, or udiiiinls
■ ration building, which will muke the
third of the group. The building
will be completed about July Ist and
will coat, when finished and furnUh
ed, about $60,000.
The surroundings are ideal for
$1 Year in Advance; 5c Copy
such an institution, being many miles
from a town of consequence. The
surroundings arc attractive, alter
nate prellic and woodland. No more
beautiful and secluded spot could
have been found.
The lands owned by this institu
tion consist of 200 acres. Of this
amount, about 140 or 150 acres are
good river bottom soil, and the rest
is on a gravel bench. The cost of
the entire tract was $14,000.
A visit to the farm is a revelation
to anyone not accustomed to seeing
young women doing men's work.
Everywhere evidence of work well
done can be seen. No weeds are al
lowed to raise a leaf above the
ground. Girls In blouses and bloom
ers, blue or brown, according to the
squad, equipped with hoes, shovels,
rakes, mattocks, wheel-barrows and
engaged in keeping farm and grounds
in a clean, attractive condition.
Health is also a resultant. Financial
results of the farm work at this Ins
titution will be of interest for com
parative purposes after a full period
of two years' activities. I believe
the mule institutions will be required
to hustle or take a back seat.
As soon as the new administration
building Is completed, the plan at the
school will be to place every Incom
ing niii in Hi*' administration build
ing and directly under the scrutiny of
the superintendent until she has de
termined which cottage will be the
beat for the girl to live in. This may
be determined in a few days and in
other cases it may take several weeks
to be best able to Judge. On entering
the cottage aHHlgned her, the girl will
be given thirty-five credits, which she
may add to or take from each month.
It will be possible to earn but sixteen
credits each month, and any who
earn this many In a month will be
given an extra two. A girl may lose
any number, for where they earn
say five for work perfectly done
each day, they may lose five every
tim,e it is not perfectly done. As
they understand, the credits do not
pay them (or right doing—that
brings its own reward—the credits
simply show appreciation.
One girl who found herself in debt
for fifty credits had to earn all of her
eighteen for three months before she
had four ahead. Othors have earned
every credit and never lost one since
the system was started last Septem
ber. Each girl must have 150 credits
to her credit before she is entitled to
enter the administration building as
an "honor girl," and only "honor
girls" will be eligible for parole.
Kvery year, just before Christmas,
the Gamma Phi Beta Sorority girls
of the I'niverslty of Washington sell
any work the girls may have dono
during their leisure time. The girls
do quantities of fancy work, and
many of them embroider, tat and
crochet most beautifully. The mon
ey derived from this Is placed to the
nirl's account to start her bank ac
count.
When a girl is paroled her em
ployer Is charged on the books of the
school with the amount decided
upon as pay for her services. She is
provided with a printed form, which
she fills out and returns each month.
This shows the itemized list of ex
penditures, together with a small
amount of spending money. This
the girl, and any balance is sent
back to the school to be added to the
bank account already started. This
bank account Is not to be drawn
upon, nor will it revert back to the
girl until her twenty-first birthday,
at which time she is automatically
discharged from the school.
The State School for Girls is In
charge of Miss Mary Campbell as su
perintendent. Miss Elizabeth Low
ing is assistant superintendent and
also acts as accountant for the Insti
tution. Harriet E. Wright Is the ag
riculturist and Is in charge of the
farm work. Miss Hulda Hainke is In
charge of the power and lighting
plant. The girls assist in caring for
and running the engine and dynamo.
Miss Hainke came February Ist and
in three weeks' time she had the
girls starting and running the en
gine alone and in their leisure time
doing all soldering and repair work.
Marion Hunter and Mrs. F. Playman
are the two matrons. The assistant
matrons are Mary Virtue and Mabel
Clarke. The housekeepers are Mrs.
iiomon and Mrs. Ounn. The domes
tic science teacher is Grace Johnson;
grade teacher, Grace Tarr, and train
ed nurse, Miriam Campbell. Anoth
er matron and housekeeper will be
added when the new building Is com
pleted, and in the fall another urade
tea' her
Over $2,000 worth of ornamental
trees and shrubs have Just been
planted, adding greatly to the beauty
of the plM*. These were a gift from
the Seattle Park Board through the
instrumentality of Mr. J. W. Thomp
son, Superintendent of Parks. Mr.
