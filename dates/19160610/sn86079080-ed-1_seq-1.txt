; Hart Members Of Police
Jury Refused To Sit Ai
Special Meeting Called
By Them.
The former president of the
Police Jury, Mr. Lasseigne, call
ea special meeting of our new
'parish fathers' for last Tuesday,
the 6th of June, and in answer
to the call all the qualified mem
bers were present at the Court
house at the appointed hout. The
objects of the meeting. as stated
in the notice, were to organize,
sit as a Board of Reviewers, and
pass upon all other matters that
might come up before the Jury.
The qualified members present
on that day were Messrs. Placide
Barre, Prudent G. Songy, Augus
tin Lasseigne and Pierre Cassa
gne, the office of the Police Jur
or from the first ward having be
come vacant on account of the
death of Hon. Andrew Nagel,
and the newly elected Police Jur
or of thesixth ward, Mr. Cyrille
Babin, being unable to act be
cause of intrusion into office and
injunction proceedings pending
gainast him.
We see absolutely no reason in
the world why the two members
from the left bank were so stub
born in their refusal to meet and
transact the regular business
of the Police Jury. To be sure
they could have sat with no dis
advantage to their political fac
tion as neither faction would
have had a majority present.
They (the two members from
the left bank).sbould have at
least been human enough to come
forward and meet even if it were
for the sole purpose of approving
and ordering the paymett of
bills which hIve long been out
standing and which a maJority
of the benmeficiaries thereof is de
pending upon for the necessaries
of life.
Messrs. Barr6and Songy sat in
Ithe Police Jury room for several
hours waiting, for the other two
apeambers to come up but the lat
ter wereconspicuousonly by their
absence. During this "watchful

In Memoriam.
Death of Our Esteemed Police
Juror !ndrew Nagel.
The Meschacdb4 chronicles
with most profound regret the
d deathof HON. ANDREW NA
dGEL, police juror from the First
Ward, and one of St. John's most
prominent and highly respected
citizens.
Mr. Nagel died at his residence
in Lucy, La., on Sunday, June
4th, at ten o'clock in the morn
e ing surrounded by his devoted
- family.
Deceased was born in tIanover,
SGermany and had been a resi
r of St. John parish for over 40
years. Mr. Nagel was 72 years
and 3 days at the time of his sad
demise.
It was our good fortune to have
known this estimable gentleman
for many years, and we, as well
as his numerous friends, only
knew him to esteem him more
highly as the years rolled by.
The grief that is felt over the
close of his long and useful career
is widespread and sincere.
His best monument will be the
excellentreputation that he has
left behind in the community in
which he lived.
His constant devotion to his
family and his kindness to every
body-will long linger as a fra
grant memory in the community
which his presence brightened,
and upon which his death has
cast a deep shadow. He is gone,
but his record will remain as a'
lasting treasure.
Agreeable to Mr. Nagel' lasti
wish Masonic ceremony was held
at his late residence, with inter
ment in the Old St. John Ceme
tery at 10 o'clock Monday morn
ing.
Mr. Nagel leaves a son, Then-{
dore J. and a daughter Miss An-I
na Nagel to mourn his loss. He
also leaves several grand- chil
jdren who willmiss him.
To the sorrowing ones mourn
ing earth's greatest loss, The f
Meschacebe extends its deepest j
sympathy. But their grief will ir
not be that of those who have no j
hope; Their dearly departed will
be ever near them and from his
dlace above, will still be the
guardian of that home so dear to
him.

Reverend Father Francis Ba

curate of the St. Peter's Catho.
s lie Church at Reserve, La., has
a recently been transfered by
Archbishop Blenk to the St. Ann
Church in New Orleans.
t Father Badeaux had been the
pastor of the St. Peter's Chureci
3ince the death of the lamente I
Father Badoil, and his recent re
moval from this parish is deeply
felt not only by his devoted con
gragation, but by all those who e
happy privilege it was to have
known him.
During his stay in St. John
the people had learned to love and
appreciate Father Badeaux's
kind and gentle ways and his
transfer is deeply felt by all who
knew him.
Father Badeaux is a devoted
priest and has always proven
himself a hard and zealous work
er, and we take pleasure in join
ing his wide circle of friends in
St, John in wishing him success
in his new parish.
Father Badeaux informes us
this week that he is at present
located at No. 1923 St. Philip
Street, where he will be pleased
to have his many friends visit
him when they will be in New
Orleans.
Reverend Father J. B. Eyraud,
for many. years curate of the
Pointe-A-la-Hache Church has
been transfered by Archbishop
Blenk to St. John where he will
replace Father Badeaux in the
