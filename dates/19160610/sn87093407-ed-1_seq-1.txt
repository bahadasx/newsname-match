WASHINGTON. Juno 10.—Wash
ington realized for the first time
today that Justice Hughes has a
real smile.
When lie was Informed of his
nomination lie seemed to throw off
the judicial bearing without losing
a wiill of Ills dignity.
He beamed at the reporters who
had been permitted to remain In
his secretary's office at his home
when they clamored for a state
ment.
He called them "you boys." and
shook hands as cordially as he
used to shake when ho was a plain
Citizen or when governor of New-
York.
Ho admitted In an aside to one
of the old newspaper men that "he
hadn't seen as much of the news
paper boys us he wanted to since
coming to Washington."
Immediately after the result of
balloting was Known, Hughes nil lit
himself In bis study with hla seero

THE JUSTICE
COLISEUM. CHICAGO. June 10—Chas. Evans Hughea,
justice of the United States supreme court, was overwhelm
ingly nominated for president by the republican convention
at 12 31 p. m.
The nomination was almost immediately made unanimous
amid a scene of the most intense enthusiasm.
At 2 p. m. Chairman Harding announced to the conven
tion that a reply of acceptance is en route from Justice
Hughe* at Washington.
( Hughes today formally resigned from supreme court, ac
cording to word from Washington.
As earlv a« m night, when Sen. Sherman withdrew and
that his 58 . •?. vote for Hughes, it was predicWf
lie would win.
Ohio next swung in line, and then just before the con
vention, Indiana, lowa, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
others.
Sen. Weeks, the only favorite son actually on the ground
here, formally withdrew shortly after the convention met,
appearing on the platform to declare he "wore no political
scars" from his unsuccessful fipht.
"Big Steve" Stevenson, otherwise "Angel Archie," na
.ional committeeman from Colorado and from the first day
of the convention a staunch Roosevelt supporter, interrupted
the ballot to announce on behalf of the Roosevelt delegates
that they considered themselves released because of the
colonel's leetter to the progressives, urging the nomination of
Henry Cabot I<odge as a compromise candidate.
Some of the undying favorite adherents nevertheless
cast their votes for T. R.

of the vote.

There Is considerable curiosity re

accepting or rejecting the leader

party.
Sam Perkins of Washington sub
mitted n motion that Senator Har
ding be made chairman of the com
mitten to notify Justice Hughes of
Ills nomination, and thai Senator
Borah be made chairman of the
committee to adviw Fairbanks.
Harding congratulated the con
ventlon on choice of Hughes and
Fairbanks and then called on
Illllea for the flnnl motion.
The convention adjourned sine
die at 2:02 p. m.
Following Is the message Hughes
sent to Chairman Maiding:
"Mr. Chairman and l>elegstes: 1
have not desired the nomination. I
have wished to remain on the
bench. Hut In this critical period
of our national history, I realize
that It is your right to summon and
that It Is my paramount duty to
respond. You speak at a time of
national exigency transcending
merely partisan consideration.
"You voice the demand for a
dominant, thoro-golng Americanism,
with firm protective upbuilding pol
icies essential to our peace and se
curity; and to that call In this
crisis I cannot fall to answer with
the pledge of all that Is In me to
the service of our country.
"Therefore. I accept the nom na
tion.
"I stand for the firm and unflinch
ing maintenance of all the rights
of American citizens on land and
sea. I neither Impugn motives nor
underestimate difficulties

that in our foreign relations we

vacillating course which has been
taken with regard to Mexico, a

course lamentably wrong with ro«
gard to both our rights and out
duties.
"We Interfered without consisten
cy, and while seeking to dlctato
when we were not concerned, we
utterly failed to appreciate and dis
charge our plain duty to our own
citizens."
"At the outset of the adminis
tration. the high responsibilities ot
our diplomatic intercourse with for
eign nations were subordinated to
a conception of partisan require
ments and presented to the world,
a humiliating spectacle of Inepti
tude.
"Belated efforts have not availed

tige so unfortunately sarriflced,
and brave words have been strip

to maintain firmly our rights under
International law."
