tion that Hurlics h;ut been nomi
nated at the coliseum as the
standard bearer of the republican
party. Chairman Kobins of the
progressive convention was an
nouncing that Colonel Roosevelt
hail been unanimously nominated
as the progressive's leader. The
convention went wild, and there
was no way to inform the dele,
pates what had transpired at. the
colisenm. Cor several minutes
Chairman Kobins vainly rapped
for order.
Five minutes passed before ordeT
was restored and James A. Garfield ,
of Ohio asked for a recess to 3 p. m., !
after hinging one verse of "America," j
"No. No," yelled the delegates, but
Chairman Robins said the time asked '
for was necessary and finally the

to return again at ;! o'clock. j
Demand T. If. Statement. j
Governor Johnson declared after
the recess that he and other leaders j
would communicate with Colonel !
Roosevelt and insist upon a definite'
statement as to whether he would ac
cept. "I insist." the governor said,
That these delegates should bo ad
vised before the convention adjourns,
just what the progressive party in
tends to do. I am very positive In my
conviction that they should not be held
in suspense in this critical time."
Konseielt Silent.
Colonel Roosevelt advised George I
W'. Perkins, Governor Hiram Johnson
and others in conference at progress
ive headquarters this afternoon that
'or the present he would hold in abey
ance his decision as to accepting the

Oyster Hay. N. Y., June 10. After a
flight of almost constant communi
ration with Chicago over the long dis
tance phone, Theodore Roosevelt re
tired to the seclusion of his home early
today. He told newspaper corres
pondents not to visit him under any
circumstances this forenoon until af
ter thny had submitted their questions
to a secretary whom he sent to the ho
tel where newspaper men are stop
ping. According to his friends the colonel
is now trying to decide what he
deems the most momentous question
of his career - whether he shall con
sider it his duty to head a third party
for what he calls straight forward
Americanism, if the republican na
tional convention nominates any per
son except Roosevelt
Awaits Balloting.
The colonel indicated that he might
have a statement to make after the
third bailot is taken by the republi
cans. Meanwhile the impression ap
peared to be growing hourly here that
be will become the candidate of the
Progressives if the republicans do not
decide upon him.
Colonel Roosevelt said that at about
8 o'clock this morning he was noti
fied by the progressive conferees that
they had come to no conclusion with
the republican conferees and that the
republican conferees had again asked
for any suggestion of a name as a can
didate from the progressive confer
ees. Lodge Offered By T. R.
He then wrote to the progressive
conferees Btating that he deeply ap
proved of their loyalty to him and
their efforts to get him nominated, but
that he thought the time had come
when carrying out the spirit of the
tatement of the progressive national
committee in January and the state
ment made by bim in Trinidad in Feb
ruary, it as their duty to present an
alternative name on which he hoped
the republicans and progressives could
unite. He presented the name of
Henry Cabot Lodge.

Republican Convention Gossip
BT J. M. COLLIGAN. 1
(Special to The Argus.)
Chicago. June 10. Roosevelt had the
gold room at the Congress hotel as his
headquarters four years ago. It was
reported that it cost him $1,000 per
day. This year it is the headquarters
of the Sherman campaigners. The
Congress management quoted the
same figure to Captain Walter A. Ros
enfield. manager for Sherman, but the
Rock Islander didn't close the deal on
the spot He argued that he ought to
have a better rate, inasmuch as he
and his friends were good patrons of
the Congress, while Roosevelt didn't
show up there more than once or twice
a year. Walter's argument brought a
reduction of $500 per day for the use
of the gold room. Each night during
the convention there has been a rous
ing meeting there. Sherman's dele
gates and followers sticking by him
loyally and creating more enthusiasm
than was shown for any of the other
favorite sons.
The chief noise, bowevcr, has been
at the Auditorium hotel all week. This
is the headquarters of the Roosevelt
crowd. "They remind me of a pack of
wild men," said an Iowa republican.
"Standing outside the Anditorium one
Is reminded of the last time he heard
the circus lions partaking of a meal
of raw meat. But it's the real pep,
we've got to confess that. If we had
that kind of spirit in the republican
convention it would sotmd like old
times. That Coliseum affair is abso
lutely dead. It has been cooked too
long. That's the way it strfkes me."
DELEGATES GROW WE ART.
Yesterday there were rumblings of
uneasiness among the republican dele
gates. Notice was served on the con
trolling powers that if a nomination
were not made Saturday there
wouldn't be a corporal's guard of dele
gates left in the city by nightfall.
There had been a move made by the
interests that financed the arrange
ments for the entertainment of the two
conventions to hold the visitors in the
citv at least through Monday, hoping
for good weather in the Interim to give
the outsiders an opportunity to spend
their shopping money. This plan has
been noised about the hotel lobbies
and the visitors are growing warm un
der the collar. They say they may
act like suckers, but they are not, and
they will refuse to fall for the frame-
up. On the other hand, tne republi
can delegates have been brought to
realize that they are nothing more
than figure-heads on the floor of the
convention hall. They came to Chi
cago to have a voice in the selection of
a presidential nominee, and they found
that they would have no more to say
In the matter than if they had re
mained at home. The nominee was to
be picked by conference committees

Washington, Jnne 10. Administra
tion officials were uneasy today over
continued reports of anti-American
demonstrations in northern Mexico.
Americans in Mexico, fearing serious
riots, are making their way to the bor
der in greater numbers and those
seeking to return to Mexico are being
advised against such by agents acting
under orders.
Most demonstrations have gone no
further than mass meetings and
speeches by agitators who resent J:he
presence of American troops on Mex
ican soil. Carranza troops have sought
usually to disperse such gatherings.
Columbus, N. M., June 10. Amer
ican scout patrols with General Persh
ing's army in Mexico have been threat
ened with an attack by Carranza
troops, according to authoritative in
formation received here today. A col
umn of Carranza cavalry is said to
have dashed forward upon an Amer
ican detachment south of Namiquipa,
rifles in hand. The Americans are said
to have averted a clash by standing
their ground. According to the report,
the Mexicans withdrew tauntingly.
Chihuahua City, Mexico, June 10.
General Luis Herrera reported today
from Parral the capture of Victor San
doval, a notorious bandit leader, in the
Providencia valley, together with four
companions, one of whom had been
shot, Sandoval was shot immediately
by his captors, and announcement was
made that his brother, Luis, now con
fined in Parral. is to be executed "for
the public good."
San Antonio, June 10. A squadron
of Texas cavalry entrained for Lar
edo early today to strengthen the
troops on patrol in Laredo. Horses will
he sent later. General Kunston had
intended the squadron of militia cav
alry for service in the Big Bend coun
try but the activities of De La Rosa
south of Laredo, caused a change in
plans.
POMMERN LOST NOT
GREATBATTLESHIP
London. June 10. The German war
ship Pnmmern, which was sunk in the
battle off Jutland, was not the battle
ship of that name, but a recently cap
tured battle cruiser, according to a
Copenhagen dispatch to the Exchange
Telegraph company, quoting a sea
captain who is a frequent visitor to
German ports. The battleship, which
was captured in 1903, was torpedoed
in the Baltic in July, 1915, according
to the captain.
from the republican and moose or-1
ganizations, with Roosevelt as the um
pire. Then the delegates would have
the privilege of saying aye, and that's
all. To be sure, if they didn't like the
man to be presented they could vote
negatively, but then they would be
called dissenters, and that would
never do.
Men who have been attending re
publican conventions for many years
are greatly disappointed at the ab
sence of enthusiasm at the Coliseum.
Every demonstration has seemed so
forced that party observers anticipate
the approach of the election with a
feeling of uncertainty. It matters
little who the nominee is, you are told
by close students of party affairs.
Rather than continue the division that
was created at Chicago four years ago,
old guard republicans yesterday wero
trying to get themselves into a mood
where they could swallow Roosevelt
But in the same breath they told you
that they would never vote for him.
All along it has seemed possible to
put Hughes over on the second or
third ballot. But the convention pow
ers have not been satisfied with'
Hughes, because of his sympathy for
hyphenism. They say the republican
party cannot afford to go before the
people seeking support for a man who
is not one-hundred per cent in his
Americanism. He must be openly
against any alliance that would give
a foreign power a voice in the admin
istration of American affairs. Yester
day it was understood that Roosevelt
might, in the event he were convinced
he could not secure the nomination for
himself, accept either Sherman. Fair
banks or Weeks. At any rate, it was
conceded by the repnblican managers
that Roosevelt would dictate the nom
inee of the convention and that when
he did so he would refuse a nomina
tion at the hands of the bull moose.
.NOTABLES IX PRESS BOX.
Among those who have loomed con
spicuously in the press box at the Coli
senm is William Jennings Bryan,
who is being paid $1,000 a day to ana
lyze the convention proceedings for a
syndicate that resells his stories to
the newspapers over the country: Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, owner of the
Hearst string of dailies; Arthur Bris
bane, the Hearst editor, who is said to
receive a larger salary than the pres
ident of the United States: lrvin Cobb,
who made himself internationally fam
ous by writing an interview with the
late Lord Kitchener, that the latter de
clared never took place, though lrvin

his readers believe him; Mary Rob

Reiterate Sinking of Derfflinger.
London, June 10, (12:20 p. m.) The
report that the German battle cruiser
Derfflinger has been sunk is reiterated
in an Amsterdam dispatch to the Ex
change Telegraph company. It says
that travelers arriving in Amsterdam
from Berlin say they were told in
Germany that the Derfflinger sank af
ter the North sea battle, while being

scores of lesser lights in the news
paper and magazine game. All have
special assignments from large publi
cations to cover the convention. Hearst
writes a daily signed editorial. Bris
bane does likewise.
Bryan's shiny pate is visible from
the remotest corners of the big hall.
He wears a perpetual smile. He told
the writer yesterday morning that the
trouble with the convention was that
it lacked a leader. He said the men
running the convention acted as
if they were afraid to make any
move that would deviate from the pro
gram fixed months in advance lest they
might spill the well known beans. "Of
course, eventually they will name a
man for president," said the Nehras
kan, "but I sincerely am of the opin
ion that the voters of the country will
return Woodrow Wilson for another
term. He has richly deserved it. No
man who has occupied the White house
has gone through the annoying, wear
ing and delicate crises that he has."
lrvin Cobb, say the boys mingling with
him in the press quarters, has been
trying to live up to his self-appointed
reputation of being fhe homliest man
in the world. Of course that is a base
libel, but Cobb enjoys the distinction.
He says the world is filled with hand
some men, but that the really homely
ones are so scarce that he shines
among them.
TH031PS05 POPULAR HOST.
Mayor Thompson is showing himself
a good fellow among the convention
visitors. It is said he has had sev
eral thousand automobiles at the dis
posal of outsiders during the week.
These cars have been donated by per
sonal friends of the mayor, and for the
free use of delegates and convention
visitors. At all of the hotels and in
the convention halls are numerous
members of the Thompson entertain
ment committee, alert and ready to be
of any desired service to strangers.
Committee members wear badges to
designate them. Thursday night there
were dances given in all of the prin
cipal hotels in honor of the visitors,
with Mayor and Mrs. Thompson as
hosts, fhe mayor and his wife per
sonally visited all of the dances.

Colonel Makes Measly Show
ing Against the Great
Strength of Hughes. .
Coliseum, June 10. To
day Charles Evans Hughes
of New York was nominated
for president by the repub
lican national convention on
the third ballot. His vote
was practically unanimous.
He received 949 1-2 votes.
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt
received 18 1-2, Du Pont 5,
LaFoIlette 3, Weeks 3 and
Lodge 7. One was absent.
Before the roll call had cov
ered half the states, Hughes
had the necessary 494. New
Jersey's vote touched the
mark.
The chair asked if the nomina
tion should be made unanimons
and recognized A. P. Moore of
Pennsylvania, who moved it be so
made.
Mrs. Nicholas Longworth, Col
onel Roosevelt's danghter, was on
the platform when the nomination
was made, .
While the demonstration on the floor
was enthusiastic, it was orderly.
Marching delegates choked the aisles
bearing state standards. While it was
going on the leaders talked about re
cessing till 3 p.m.
The chairman announced the nomi
nation of candidates for the vice presi
dency was next in order of business
and the clerk started the roll call.
The demonstration quieted down af
ter 17 minutes and the official result
was read as follows:
Hughes, 949. Weeks, three. LaFoI
lette, three. Lodge, seven.
Fairbanks Tice President.
Charles Evans Hughes of New York,
was today nominated for president ot
the United States by the republican,
national convention and Charles War
ren Fairbanks of Indiana was named
for vice president
Justice Hughes' nomination came on
the third ballot and but one ballot
was needed to select for vice presi
dent, Fairbanks.
There was an enthusiastic demon
stration after the candidates were
named.
The official count was:
Fairbanks, 863; Burkett, 10S, and the
others scattered.
On motion of Representative Cole of
Ohio, the Fairbanks nomination then
was made unanimous.
S. A. Perkins of Washington moved
that Chairman Harding be appointed
chairman of the committee to notify
Justice Hughes and that Senator
Borah be chairman of the committee
to notify Mr. Fairbanks. It was car
i ried. A vote of thanks to the officers
i of the convention, the city and other
routine motions were quickly adopte-J-At
2:10 p. m. the republican nation
al convention adjourned.
Indianapolis, Ind., June 10. When
Mr. Fairbanks was informed of hia
nomination for vice president, he de
clined to make any statement as to
whether he would accept or decline it.
The managers of his campaign from
Chicago are urging him to accept. Ha
said he might make a statement later
in the day.
Sherman Releases Delegate.
Senator Sherman of Illinois releas
ed his 56 delegates today and it was
said that practically all would vote
for Hughes on the first ballot taken
by the republican national convention
today.
Senator Weeks also released his
delegates. Massachusetts men indi
cated they wanted to stay with him
to the end, but others gave signs of
going over to Hughes.
Fairbanks supporters gave signs of
not pressing their fight further and
the Hughes leaders expected more
additions from Indiana and other
states.
There is a pcruliar contest on over
the vice presidency. The two men
most prominently mentioned in this
connection are Mr. Fairbanks and
Senator Borah of Idaho. Neither of
the men wants the position. Senator
Borah could not be seen early today,
but has constantly said that it would
be especially undesirable for him to
be named for the vice presidency.
Refuse Tice rresidencj.
Fairbanks for several years past has
declined to let his name be used in
this connection. The supporters ot
Senator Borah are for him because
they believe that his candidacy would
