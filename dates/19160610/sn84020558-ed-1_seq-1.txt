CHICAGO, June 9 On the two only
ballots taken today in the republican
national convention, Justice Hughes
led the field and gained strength. His
supporters confident that another bal
not would give him a majority, re
sisted adjournment, but the conven
tion tired and worn with a continuous
1 hours session decided to rest until
11 a. m. and adjourned until that
hour.
It was the first time since 1888 that
a rei ublican convention has taken
more than one ballot to choose a pres
idential nominee.
On the first ballot Justice Hughes
rolled 253"j votes. He got 42 from
his own slate, and aside from Oregon
and Florida, the remainder were
largely scattering. On the second
ballot he Increased to 328 votes. It
requires 494 votes to nominate.
Colonel Roosevelt's topmost strength
In the first day's balloting- was 81
votes. Besides Justice Hughes, the
Colonel, Charles V. Fairbanks and
Coleman Du Pont, of all the 17 men
who had votes on the first ballot
nlone made an increase on the sec
ond. The demand for Colonel Roose
velt when he was nominated by Sen
ator Kail of New Mexico lasted 41
minutes and broke the record for this
convention. All observers agreed that
it was largely a gallery demonstra
tion and the participation was scat
tering from the delegate section. The
Fairbanks demonstration ran n?xt
with 35 minutes; the Burton demon
stration lasted 34 minutes, and the
Hughes demonstration lasted 20
minutes.
Follow Instructions
On the first ballot the delegates
followed their instructions, voting for
favorite sons and primary choices.
Senator Weeks got 0a; Elihu Root.

Brumbaugh withdrew and proposed
the nomination of Colonel RooseveH.
Tim other favorite sons remaine.l
through the balloting. On the second
ballot one vote was cast for Major
General Leonard Wood and one for
Chairman Harding.
Tomorrow, the Hughes supporters
predict, they will continue to draw
strength and nominate their candid-date.
How Hughes Gained
An analysis showing where the
gains of Justice Hughes came from on
the second ballot follows:
In all Justice Hughes gained 75
votes on the second ballot. He gained
1 on Alabama, 2 in California, 1 in
Georgia, 1 in Kentucky, 2 in Louisi
ana, 2 in Maine; 8 in Massachusetts, 2S
in Michigan, 4 in Missouri, 2 in Ne
braska, 3 in N'ew Hampshire. 4 in New
Jersey, 1 in New York. 6 in Pennsyl
vania. 2 in South Carolina, 2 in Texas,

Idaho, 1 in South Carolina, 1 in Wash
ington and 1 in Georgia.
In ten continuous hours the dele
gates today sat through eleven nomin
ating speeches which presented Jus
tice Hughes, Elihu Root, former Sen
ator Purton, Senator Weeks, T. Cole
man Du Pont. Senator Sherman, for
mer Senator Fairbanks, Senator Cum
mins, Colonel Roosevelt, Senator La
Follette and Governor Brumbaugh.
There were a various number of sec
onding speeches. Ten had. been
planned for Colonel Roosevelt and al
though Chairman Harding agreed to
recognize them all, they did not all
appear. The demonstrations as can
didates were named were the usual
cheering, roaring, marching affairs.
During the uproar that greeted the
nomination of Colonel Roosevelt, the
police had to' be sent to the galleries
to stop women from tearing bunting
om the railings. Otherwise the
demonstrations, although noisy and
prnlcnged, were good natured and
orderly.
Tomorrow the convention leaders
expect to dispose of both presidential 1
and vice presidential nominations. j
When the delegates take their seats
at 11 o'clock, the third ballot will be
Hughes against the field.
The total vote of the convention
fixed by the credentials committee at
989 was reduced to M7 because the
two Porto Rican delegates failed to
qualify. This reduced the number
necessary for a nomination to 494 in
stead of 495 as previously had been
announced.

WASHINGTON, June 9. Anti
American demonstrations in northern
Mexico continue, according to official
advices today, particularly in the state
of Chihuahua, San Luis I'otosi and
Nuevo Leon, and although the mani
festations thus far have been confined
mostly to speech making, consular
agents have reported that the temper
of the people appears such that any
eventualities might be possible.
Americans are leaving for the bor
der in steadily increasing numbers. Un
der previous instructions, state de
partment agents in Mexico are giving
every possible aid. In addition border
agents have been instructed to urge
those seeking to return to Mexico to
stay on the American side of the bor
der for the present.
Some reports said the demonstra
tions were in part incited by agitator
Mass meetings were held in Sal
tillo last night at which many speeches
condemning the presence of American
troops in Mexico were made. Similar
meeting have been held or are contem
plated at other points. The only vio
lence against American property was
at Chihuahua City and Monterey where
there are no consular agents.
Statements from Americans reaching
the border and also from consular
agents in Mexico have indicated that

The Russians are keeping up with
success the offensive against the Aus
trian from the Pripot river to the Ru
manian border, along the front of
some 250 miles. The troops of Em
peror Nicholas have crossed the Stripa
river in Galicia and reached the Zlota
Li pa river. Petrograd reports that
1,143 officers and more than 64,700
men have been taken prisoners since
t he present great drive against' the
Austrians began. ,
East of Lutsk, near the center of the
advancing Russian line, Gen. Brus
silofi's trocps have made important
advances along the Styr river and the
Kevel Rovno railway. It is reported
from Petrograd that German troops
have been sent to aid the Austrians.
Vienna admits that the Austro-Hun-garian
troops have reached new posi
tions on the river Styr in Volhynia
after fighting rear guard actions with
the Russians.
The Germans after their successful
thrust in the Thiaumont farm have
ceased for the moment their infantry
attacks against this section of the
Verdun front. Faris reports. Their ar
tillery bombardment, however, has con
tinued to bo heavy in the region south
of the Thiaumont farm, in the Chap
itre wood, in the Fumin wood, and
south of Damloup. On the left bank
of the Meuse several attacks by Ger
man infantry- against hill No. 304 have
been repulsed by the French.
Under the pressure of infantry and
artillery attacks, the Italian troops
have withdrawn to new positions In
the zone east of Asiago and east of
the "ampomulo valley. This is ad
mitted by Rome, and Vienna officially
claims further gains on the Asiago
highlands. The Austro-Hungarians
report the number of Italians taken
prisoners, since the beginning of the
month as 12.400.
King Ccnstantine has signed an
order demobilizing twelve chesses of
the Greek r.rmy, amounting to 150,000

being the esult of nressure by the

AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO, June 9.
Theodore Roosevelt will be nom
inated for president tomorrow by the
progressive national convention unless
there is some political miracle an
agreement between its conferees and
those from the republcan organiza
tion. For hours today the leaders of the
convention staved off a nomination
that they knew and every delegate
in the hall knew was crowding for
ward with the hours themselves, and
could no more be stopped than an
avalanche if once the convention was
assured that the last hope of peace
with the republicans was gone and
Mr. Roosevelt's nomination at the
Coliseum could not be accomplished.
After three sessions that ran
through the gamut of emotions from
hysterics for Mr. Roosevelt to a calm
dispassionate discussion of planks in
the platform, the convention ad
journed at 9:58 tonight until 10:30
tomorrow. It was only after , re
peated assurances from the leaders
that Colonel Roosevelt himself de
sired that the nomination be post
poned and oratory that played upon
their good nature that the delegations
swallowed their own convictions that
the nomination was the real and only
business to be considered and con
sented to quit the hall for the night.
All clay the delegates kept on guard
while the leaders watched or listened
over the telephone to detect any un
expected move on the part of the re
publicans. As the ballots were taken
in the Coliseum they waited and lis
tened and kept their tempers. They
were told they must "keep the faith"
and allow the ballots to be taken by
the republicans, according to the
agreement between the peace con
ferees and approved by Colonel Roose
velt himself. The approval of the
colonel was a trump card held up the
sleeves of the leaders, but never
played, for when the Coliseum quit
for the night the delegates, tired out
with the long sitting in the hot,

ly after the adjournment of the re
publican convention tonight Co!.
Roosevelt assumed personal direction !
of the progressive convention through
his lieutenants over the long distance
telephone. He expected to be up most
of the night making plans for to
morrow. Colonel Roosevelt was kept in close
touch with the balloting in Chicago
by progressive leaders over the tele
phone and by the newspaper corres
pondents at Oyster Bay. He appeared
well pleased with the result of the
second ballot which left Hughes far
short of enough delegates to win the
nomination.
Colonel Roosevelt feels that the
Hughes adherents will not be able to
gain further strength on succeeding
1 ballots and he seemed to attach signif
icance to the fact that it was Senator
I'enrose who moved for an adjournment.

AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO, June 9.
Governor Whitman of New York to
night asserted that Hughes would be
nominated tomorrow.
"The pence conference tonight will
be futile," he said. "There is no pros
pect of an agreement and Justice
Hughes will be named as standard
bearer of the republicans tomorrow
on the third or fourth ballot."
"I hesitate to predict the results of
the conference tonight," said George
W. Perkins.

his own chances of getting the nomin
at ion were thereby increased.
Col. Roosevelt announced tonight
that he had exacted a pledge from the
progressives not to nominate until to- I

The progressive national convention
is becoming restless, Colonel Roosevelt
admitted tonight. Telephone eajla for
him have come from Chicago every
hour and almost every half hour dur
ing the day. The" party leaders who
are attending the convention have
pressed insistently for information as
to bow much longer they must wait
before making a nomination. Colonel
Rooseveit responded, In effect, to each
appeal by advising delay and propos
ing that the progressives wait until
some definite action was taken by the
republicans. Colonel Roosevelt to
night still refused to declare his atti
tude in regards fo the nominating of a
separate ticket by the progressive. It

CHICAGO, June 9. Keeping faith
With the promise implied in the agree
ment received by the republican and
progressive harmony conference both
conventions today did justwhat they
were expected to do.
Not withstand ins predictions and
prohpesies that one or the other would
get nut of hand or do something sur
prising, nothing unexpected happened.
The republicans met, listened to nom
inating speeches, took the two prom
ised ballots without a nomination and
adlourned until 11 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
The progressives met an hour before
and well ,in hand, followed the pro.
gram laid down by the managers.
They debated the platform, kept tab
on the Coliseum, listened to the efforts
of thi'ir best orators, -.aid when word
came that the republicans had ad
lourned without making a nomination
they adjourned until 10.30 a. m.
On the heels of the end of the two
sessions, th conference committee me;
again, but from neither side came any
expected hope of a development that
would upset what tonight is expected
on every hand the nomination of Jus
tice Hughes at the Coliseum and of

SLAUGHTER TO BE TRIED

PUEBLO, June 9 Judge C. S- Es

trial cf V. B. Slaughter of Iallas, Tex.,

to begin June 17. The case grew out
of the failure of the Mercantile Na

president. ,
(Special to The Republican)
CHICAGO, 111., Jnne 9 Very stren
uous days in both conventions. Pro
gressives in an effort- to hold dele
gates from nominating Roosevelt un
til every possible effort for coopera
tion had been exhausted and in the
republican convention because of de
termined efforts of the old guard to
prevent the crowd from stampeding
delegates to Roosevelt. . The man-
igement of the convention was
astounded at the Roosevelt strength
in the galleries.
Senator Borah visited the progres
sive convention and received a warm
welcome when he told the delegates
that he realized that millions of vot
ers consider Roosevelt the man best
equipped to lead the nation in these
critical times.
Most of the day was consumed in
nominating speeches in the republican
convention. Most of the speakers
urged harmony strongly. Governor
Willis of Ohio made a telling sledge
hammer speech. The demonstration
at the close of Whitmans speech last
ed 25 minutes for Hughes. After the
presentation by Nicholas Murray But
ler of Root's name there was a dem
onstration covering fifteen minutes.
Burton's ovation was principally con
fined to Ohio delegates and lasted
about 30 minutes.
Senator Fall of New Mexico placed
Colonel Roosevelt's name in nomina
tion in a short but effective speech
and the crcwd and about 70 delegates
started a sure enough demonstration.
Newspaper men agree that the dem
onstration which jiccurred mediately
after- the presentation -of Roosevelt's
name by Senator Fall, was one of
the most remarkable in political his
tory. The tumultuous cheering con
tinued for forty-five minutes and
while a majority of the delegates sat
in silence, a large number of them
stood on their chairs and cheered
with an irrieistable enthusiasm. Of
the spectators supposed to represent
the old guard republicans a large part
nearly howled their heads off.
One of the great features of the
progressive convention is the wonder
ful self control of the delegates and
their remarkable loyalty to their lead
ers. Raymond Robins makes a wonder
ful presiding office, just tnd tactful
and has won the aJmiraUcm of the
entir convention. All the planka of
tin; platform have now been adopted
and are ready for prompt action on
the entire platform. Efforts to insert
a national prohibition plank in the
platform failed by a vote of 520 to 82.
To ascertain the sentiment of dele
gates on prohibition if not complicated
by insertion in a national platform,
Robins asked for a vote and the vast
majority of the delegates rose cheer
ing to their feet.
The Arizona repulican delegation is
now composed of Kent, Overlook,
Freudenthal, Breen, Frank Stewart
and Bracy Curtis. Wright 'and An
derson have both left town. Hughes
forces were confident he would get
355 votes on tire first ballot taken at
eight last night but the first ballot
showed but 253 votes for Hughes,
and 65 for Roosevelt. Just before the
second ballot was taken, Governor
Brumtaugh of Pennsylvania withdrew
stating to the convention he hoped his
delegates would vote for the man the
people wanted, Theodore Roosevelt.
On the second ballot Senator Lodge of
Massachusetts voted for Roosevelt
while Ford, Taft and a few Weeks
delegates went to Hughes. On the
second ballot the leaders were Hughes,
328 Root, 98; Fairbanks, SSVi;
Cummins, 85; Roosevelt, 81.
The Hughes forces wanted another
ballot and on motion to adjourn, the
Hughes delegates from Oregon asked
for a roll call, but adjournment to
eleven o'clock tomorrow morning car
ried, 696 to 286.
At the evening session of the pro
gressives ringing addresses made by
Johnson, Allen and many others indi
cating .clearly that unless the confer
ence committees of both conventions
make definite headway tonight. Colo
nel Roosevelt would be nominated by
the progressives tomorrow.
