The Republican National Convention Has Firmly or Tightly
Locked Horns Over the Selection of a Candidate for
President of the United States to Run Up Against Hon.
Woodrow Wilson. In the Final Show Down the Indications
Are That Either Col. Theodore Roosevelt or Hon. Charles
E. Hughes Will Walk Away with the Presidential
Nomination
MAYOR WTTiTiTAM HALE THOMPSON, AS EXCLUSIVELY PREDICTED
IN THESE COLUMNS MAY 13TH, SUCCESSFULLY PUT HON. ROY
O. "WEST OUT OF THE RUNNING FOE THE ILLINOIS MEMBER OF
THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE, HIS HONOR, THE MAYOR, RECEIV
ING 38 VOTES AS AGAINST 17 FOR MR. WEST.
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THIS CITY HAS ALSO BEEN FAVORABLY
MENTIONED FOR THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
HON. CHARLES S. DENEEN, WHO IS CHAIRMAN OF THE ORGANIZA
TION COMMITTEE OF THE ILLINOIS DELEGATION, HAS BEEN
BOOMED BY MANY OF HIS WARM FRIENDS FOR THE NOMINA
TION FOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
The Republican national convention
convened in the Coliseum shortly be
fore noon on Wednesday and if all
signs do not fail it "will be one of the
longest drawn out conventions in the
history of the Grand Old party, and
at the present writing the very -wisest
of the big Republican politicians pre
dict or contend hat the convention will
run or lap over into this coming week
and that no nominations for either presi
dent or for vice president will be made
before Monday or Tuesday. The con
vention has been tightly locked and at
no time within the history of the par
ty have there been so many presidential
candidates and has there been such a
bitter fight to secure the nomination
for president of the United States.
On the final showdown the indica
tions are that either Col. Theodore
Roosevelt or Hon. Charles E. Hughes
will make their " getaway" with the
presidential nomination.
The Sherman, Thompson, Lowden,
Brundage forces or combination the
first of this week carried out the com
pact which was entered into at the late
state convention and that was to side
track the Hon. Roy O. West and put
Mayor William Hale Thompson as the
Illinois member of the Republican na
tional committee, and in the round up
tis Hon., the mayor received 38
Totes as against 17 votes for Mr. West,
in speaking in behalf of his friend,
Roy O. West, the Hon. Charles S. De
nccn unbosomed himself in part as fol
lows: "In all the political positions Mr.
TVest has held his services have been
atisfactory and indeed of the highest
Talue to the party and the public.
"In the last primary in April Mr.
RVst did not make an issue. To have
ione so would have been to imperil the
litnation for Lawrence Y. Sherman.
Had Mr. West and his friends made an
ssnc Illinois might have gone for
John M. Harlan for delegate at large.
To save the situation for Mr. Sherman
Mr. West and his friends refrained
from opposing Mayor Thompson and
Mr. Sherman by selecting some Roose
velt delegate to pit against hint.
Says People Chose West
"It was Mr. Thompson himself who
furnished the one issue. It "was the
otc of Hlinois. It was hissuggestion
that Mr. West and Mr. Thompson abide
by the vote of the state, the proposition
being that the one who received the
higher vote Bhould bo made national
committeeman.
"And on that proposition "Mr. West
received in Cook county 73,246 votes
to Mr. Thompson's 72,493. The vote
n Illinois was 138,634 for Mr. "West
ana 137,941 for Mr. Thompson. Which
ever way you look at itj Mr. West re
ceived the indorsement of the Repub
lican voters of both Cook county and
Hlinois over Mr. Thompson.
"Mr. Thompson wanted the people
to determine the question and they did
so. The Republicans of Hlinois elected
West.
"The issue here is whether the peo
ple's verdict should be ratified or set
aside. If you are going to abide by the
decision of the Republican voters of
Illinois, then you will elect Mr. West.
If you want to ignore the decision of
the Republican voters of this state,
then you can elect Mr. Thompson."

WHY JACK JOHNSON WAS BAN
ISHED FROM ENGLAND.
Since tho time, some months ago,
when ex-World Champion Jack John
son was given a polite hint by the
British military authorities that his
room would be more delightful to them
than his presence, a thick veil of mys
tery has surrounded the incident, and
no one until now knew the cause for
his banishment from tho British Isles.
But here at last is the cause, as told
in Johnson's own words:
"I had a deal with a physician, and
when I had a friend that wanted to
escape military service, I'd just write
him a note, you know. And he would
find my friend entirely unfit to go to
the trenches. Five hundred dollars
was pretty cheap at that, when I had
to split it with the doctor. The last
fellow I got off was healthier than I
am."
TEN THOUSAND WOMEN PARADED
THROUGH THE STREETS OF
CHICAGO IN THE DOWNPOUR OF
RAIN IN FAVOR OF EQUAL SUFFRAGE.
Wednesday afternoon in a heavy
downpour of rain, well on to ton thou
sand women, including many of the
leading society women of this city and
of other sections of the country pa
raded tho downtown streets of Chi
cago in favor of equal suffrage and the
chances are more than favorable that
tho Republican National Convention
will put a plank in its platform and
pass a resolution in favor of giving
women all over this country a man's
chance with the ballot, which will be
eminently just and proper.
For we honestly believe that there
are millions and millions of womem in
this country who are a thossand tines
better qualified and more capable in
every way to exercise the .right of
franchise, than many of the worthless
men who have in the past and are at
the present time controlling the affairs
of the various cities) counties and
states, throughout the Union.
Dr. and Mrs. J. H. Goodwin, of Co
lumbia, S. C, are the guests of Mr.
and Mrs. Edward H. Wright, 2963 8.
