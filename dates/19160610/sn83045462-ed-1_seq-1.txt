Two Ballots Taken Yesterday.
On the only two ballots* taken yesterday
in the republican national convention
Justice Hushes led the held and
sained strength. His supporters, confident
that another ballot would give
him a majority, resisted adjournment,
but the convention, tired and worn
with a continuous ten-hour session,
* was determined to rest until this morning
at 11 o'clock, and adjourned until
that time.
Tt was the first lime since IMS that a
republican convention has taken more
than one ballot to choose a presidential
nominee.
On the first ballot Justice Hughes
polled 253 votes. He got forty-two
from his own state and aside from
Oregon and Florida the remainder were
largely scattering. On the second ballot
he increased to 328 4 votes. It requires
494 votes to nominate.
Col. Roosevelt's topmost strength in
the first day's balloting i$as eightyone
votes. Aside from Justice Hughes,
the colonel and Charles W. Fairbanks,
of all the eighteen men who had votes
on the first ballot not one made an
increase on the second.
The expected demonstration for Col.
Roosevelt when he was nominated by
Senator Fajl of New Mexico lasted
forty-one minutes and broke the record
for this convention.

Analysis of the Gains.
An analysis showing where the gains
of Justice Hughes came from on the
second ballot follows:
In all. Justice Hughes gained 75 votes
on the second ballot. He gained 1 in
Alabama. 2 in California. 1 in Georgia, I
1 in Kentucky, Z In Louisiana, 2 in

New York, ? in Pennsylvania, 2 inSouth
Carolina, 2 in Texas, 1 in Utah,
3 In Virginia, 3 In West Virginia, 1 in
Hawaii. He lost 1 vote In Arkansas
and 1 in Tennessee.
Roosevelt gained sixteen votes on the
second ballot. One of these came from
Maine, one from Massachusetts, two
from Michigan, fifteen from Pennsylvania
and one from Texas. He lost one
vote in Idaho, one in South Carolina,
one in Washington and one In Georgia.
In ten continuous hours the delegates
sat through eleven nominating speeches
which presented Justice Hughes. Elihu
Root, former Senator Burton, Senator
Weeks, T. Coleman du Pont, Senator
Sherman, former Senator Fairbanks.
Senator Cummins, Col. Roosevelt, Senator
La Follette and Gov. Brumbaugh.
There were a various number of seconding
speeches. Ten had been planned
for Col. Roosevelt, and although Chairman
Harding agreed to recognise them
all. they did not all appear. The demonstrations
as candidates were nominated
were the usual cheering, roaring,
marching affairs.
The total vote of the convention fixed
by the credentials committee at 989
was reduced to 987, because the two
Porto Rtcan delegates failed to qualify.
This reduced the number necessary for
a nomination to 494 Instead of 495, as
prevtoudlt' bad' been announced.

AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO,
June 10, 12 :33 p.m.?At the very
moment when it was flashed to
the progressive convention that
Hughes had been nominated at
the Coliseum as the standard
bearer of the republican party I
Chairman Robins of the progres-!
sive convention was announcing
that Col. Roosevelt had been
unanimously nominated as the
progressives' leader, the convention
went wild and there was no
way to inform the delegates what
had transpired at the Coliseum.
For several minutes Chairman
!
Robins vainly rapped for order.
While the report of the conference
committee was being considered,
James A. Garfield interrupted
proceedings and asked the j
1 : convention to suspend regular or-:
| der of business until news from
i the republican convention should
; arrive. This was agreed to.
Less than a minute later Chair- j
man Robbins called for the nomi-j
nation of a President, and Bain,
bridge Colby of New York was
i recognized - to nominate Col.
'j Roosevelt amid great applause.

as one man and voted for CoL

he was so pronounced by the
chairman.
Five minutes had passed before
order was restored, and then Mr.
Garfield tried to tell the progressives
that Justice Hughes
had been nominated by the republicans.
The assemblage began
singing "America."
Then Chairman Robins reminded
the convention of the necessity
of nominating a Vice
