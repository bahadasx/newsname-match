Hud Republican Legislature Granted
Funds As Requested New .Mexico
Would Have Full Uuohi Of Men
Sania Fe, "Had the last Hepubli
calion legislature granted our re
quest for funds for the National
Guard, and for the enactment' of a
military code, the' call of the Pres
ident would have found us with an
adequate forre, physically fit, and
the state would have been snared
its present humiliation.
This declaration, made by Ad
justant General H. T. Herring in
Santa Fe a few days ago, explains
in a few words why New Mexico is
now short the required number of
men for military service on the bor
der; why the governor and the ad
jutant general have been compelled
to appeal to the people to uphold
the honor and the dignity of the state
and why. allicers of the Guard am
now scouring the various districts
in search of 300 recruits. At the
same time it places the responsi
bility for the present situation where
it belongs on the shoulders of the
lhindly partisan Republican poli
ticians, whose slogan, ever since they
were repudiated by the people in
the first slate election, has been,
"Keep every dollar possible out of
the hands of the Democratic gover
nor, regardless of results."
"We ask the legislature," contin
ued Adjutant General Herring, "to
appropriate $30,000 for the National
Guard, to the end that encampments
might be held, rifle practice indulg
ed in and shooting contests arranged
and other measures carried out
that would add to the attractiveness,
and also to the cllicieiu-y of the
state militia. We were given $10,
500, or only a little more than half
ot life amount requested, which re
presented a very conservative es
timate of the Guards needs. An
urgent request for a military code
enactment, requiring a thorough
physical examination, which would
have meant troops physically fit for
military service, was turned down
with little or no consideration. The
intention to let the Guard struggle
along as best it might was plainly
shown."
In ignoring the matter (.f state
preparedness, the last Republican
legislalureffollowed the example of
the first state legislature, likewise
donimanted by the Republican mach
ine leaders. Due.to uneasiness then
existing, that body was asked to
make an appropriation that would
enante the state to take measures
for its protectioiy in case of emer
:uc). j.ue vi 1 1 carrying ine ap
propriation wr.-j put through the
house, but wh ii it reached the Sen
ate, two-thirds Republicans, its dea
th was prompt'y decreed, and it was
allowed to expire in committee, whol
ly because Hie bosses feared that
the money would be used by the
Democratic governor and his ap
pointees in a'.manner rellecting cred
it on the Democratic administration.

VThere is some fine land in the
Sedan country, ami the fanners are'
making the most of it." j
Orrcu Heatty, Union County Agri- ,
cutturlist. after making a trip to'
Sedan in his new Ford, is enthus- i
ia-dir over the prospect of his work;
in this county, and is parlicularily '
pleased with the country around Se- i
dan and Stead. He was also coin-'
plinienfary toward the manner in !
which the laud owners were using
their land in that section. ( ' I
Some of the Stead and Sedan ;
farmers have their corn up in fine j
shape. Others are late in planting'
but the seeding will go forward with '
a rush ami the late corn will mu-
ture nearly as early as that already!
planted. A considerable acreage of !
liens is being put in ami others are '
contemplating the 'Frijoli' as a lat-'i
er crop. j
The county Agrirulturlist ii ,an
energetic worker and seems fond of
his work. He has not yet become ;
fully acquainted with the resourse I
of the county and until he does, is j
reticient about atiy suggestions for'
crrp betterment. j
His work in Oregon, und iiis gen-
eral observation of funning con-1
ditions in the country at large, how- I
ever, have led him to believe that
a covel srop for the dry fall months j
is. necessary fjr successful dry farm.
mg. lule it is highly impractical,
in most instances, for the dry fann
er to try for two crops a year, as
can the farmer of the more humid
sections, or in the inegated dis
tricts, there is but little excuse for
uncovered ground during the mois
ture sapping months of the early
full. As a catch crop the county
agent is partial to cow peas, lie be.
lieves the cow pea better than the
soy beau for several reasons which
wi'i probably be noted in forthcom
ii - articles for the local press.
I Mr. Ileal ty has established his of
fice in one of the small rooms on the
-ec oud floor of the court house and
will be in his office Saturdays and
Mondays of each week.Wjlis state
ment of his hours and plans appears
in another column of this issue.
r'The ollice equipment has not yet
arrived from the State Agricultural
College, but will in a very short
time. k The equipment at this time
will be limited to ollice furniture of
Hie sort generally used and will not
include any scientific, o'r laboratory,
equipment. Later, if it ie necessary
and advisable, some of the simpler
apparatus may be installed. In the
mean time any tests of soil or milk
or other farm problems demanding
laboratory work will be made by the
College and the results forwarded to
Mr. Heatty.
New Rural Route Proposed
A new rural route, carrying mail
to Sampson, thence west to the Sand
Gap country and then by a differ
ent road back to Grenville, a dis
tance of some thirty five miles, is
proposed and may be started in the
very near future, according to W.
T. Oldham, who was in Clayton the
lator part of the week. Oldham is
the carrier on the star route between
Grenville and Thomas, an5 is de
cidedly interested in the proposed
new rural delivery.
The proposed routo is to take the
place of the star routo formerly
collecting the Grenville and Samp
son offices, which was discontin
ued several weeks ago, and will
prove of more service to tho resi
dents of that section than the st;ir
route. An inspector has been ovr
ho proposed routo, recently, and it
is beleived, will report favorably.

TEST WELL BEING DIG
Prospecting For New City Water
Supply Is Under Way; Well To
Be Finished Thursday
,, ' ler Lingering Illness.
Work of sinking the test well on, .

town, and upon w hich the city has i iden of Union County and one of her
secured a iwo thousand dollar on- ! foremost citizens died Simdav morn
lion should a sufficient flow bu de
velnpnd, was started Tuesday and
well bas been put down some twel
ve of the twenty six feet proposed.
Engineer C. L. I.oinax, of Denver,
is in charge of the work
remain act is ly on the job
and will
until the
we I has been finished and the meter
tests completed..
There is supposed to be an un
derflow, in the draw in which the
land is located, of volume great en
ough to suply the town with water
for many years to come. If such is
the case the water suply problem
of Clayton is solved.
The test well, which is five by
eight feet, will be sunk to the re
quired depth, twenty six feet, and
by means of a pump an an accurate
water meter the exact volume
the underflow will be acertained.
Should the underflow prove of
sufficietn nlume, I.oinax, and his
chief, II. o. Duerr, also of Denver,
and employed as consulting engin-
i er by the city, will plan means of
! raising the water to the surface and
! to the city stand-pipe,
i Two methods of raising the undcr
j flow and colecting it in sufficient
j volume to suply pumps of the nec
! esary capacity have been suggested.
I he adoption of the one or the other
depends upon the volume of flow
encountered and the money avail
able for the purpose.
Should the underflow be a large
one and of some definite pennnancy
method of collecting the water
vjU
be to sink several large pit-wells,
i forty to fifty feet in diameter to the
j required depth, and conect them in
'such a maner that the suction pipe
jor intake to the pump will drain all.
This would prove by far the most
I practical ami the least expensive
j of the two.
I However, should the flow prove
small and inconstant, or intermit
an!, ami the. source still be desired,
the only feasable method, and one
that would entail a large expenditure
w ould be to raise the sheet of water
to the surface and form a reservoir
of immense capacity "v means of

iccomplished by ex
cavating a trench several hundred
yards in lenglh to a sufficient dep
th to reach the bed-rock, or hard
pan which underlays the flow. Us
ing the hard-pan, it is hardly prob
able that a bed-rock will be found,
as a foundation a concrete wall will
b- erected of sufficient length and
hcighth to empound the toil flow.
The water, striking the imnervinna
ping will raise to the heighth of
source, and colect in the reser
voir thus formed. Hy this means
even a very small flow can be so
effectivly impounded that it might
be sufficient for the purpose.

"vvever, 'und while it is

in some of the largest, ritv

for the minutest care and percision.
There is usually a doubt as to the
firm bedding of the sloping in the

jvclope after the work is completed
, it would render tho system useless
and make a total waste of the money
expended in its construction.

JOHN JAMES BROPHY. PIONEER
I CALLED TO LAST REWARD
I Greatly Respected Public Official
; Ami Four-square Citien Dies Af-
ing at three thirty five a. in, after a
lingering illness of many months.
Death was directly due to pto
maine poisinging, but grief over the
i death of a son some months ago
i had weakened a natunalv rinnred
constitution to a point where res
istance was almost beyond trying.
Requiem Mass was held at the
Catholic Church at nine o'clock the
morning following his death, June
fifth, and the funeral services were
helil from the church the same after
ni M.m. The Rev. Father Dumarest
officiated t both services. The
funeral was one of the most largly
attended in the history of the town
of ! the host of friends and acquaintan
ces of the deeeased paying splendid
tribute to man they had all loved
and honored for his fearlessness
and honor in all things, large and
small.
The pallbearers were intimate
friends of the deceased, being C. U.
Bridges, A. C. Miera, J. M. Gonzales,
Dick Carson, John Spring and Tom
Gray. The casket was heaped with
floral tributes. Interment was made
in the Masonic cemetery.
John Brophy was fifty three years
of age. He was born in Wisconsin on
October 2Í, 1801. He left home at an
early age an came to the west. Lo
cating at Tascosa, Texas, lie soon
became uoUhI for the sterling qual-
mes wnicu were ins ana was eiect-
a peace officer in Texas during the
day of the cattle thieves and when
outlawry was at its heigth.
He moved to Union County about
twenty years ago and shortly after
establishing his residence here wa.s
awarded a place of public trust as a

ploy of the people during his whole
life in this comunity, in ono oficial
position or another and he never
betrayed the trust placed in him by
his employers.
He is survived by a widow and a
son, John, Jr., and a host of friends
extend their sympathy to the be
lieved wife and son in their hour of
sorovv.
Slightly Injured In Runaway
A. II. Weakle was slightly injured
Friday afternon when ho was caught
under the whels of a wagon in trying
to stop a runaway team. The rear
whels of the wagon pased over both
legs and it was thought for a white
that he might have ben injured in
ternaly. Examination by a physi
cian, however, developed only a few
painful bruises. The runaway was
one of the teams belonging to tho
Hill brothers which dashed the full
lenglh of Main street and jepor
died the apearance of ono or two
Fords which had the temerity to be
parked near tho corner. The tern
! ran itself out of ireath and stoo
ped a few miles this side of Kenton,
it is said, without injury to them
selves or the wagon.
