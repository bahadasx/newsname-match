THE RATTLE ROAR. DUST
SMOKE OF BATTLE IN CHICAGO
Teddy the Big Noise Wants His Way
or He Will Certainly Know the
Reason Why
And at this Stage of
It Looks Very
Would
That certainly is a peach of a row among the members of the
Grand Old Party and the United States of Roosevelt at Chicago.
' It is what O'Hooligan would call "a fine shindy."
Never before in the history of the country has there been so
- much leg work, brain work, crooked work and coarse work done
by the fixers of each side and never before has the high honor of a
presidential nomination been so kicked and scuffed about. To
accept a nomination after it had been so dragged in the filth and
wallowed in the mire of disreputable action, is almost equivalent
to committing political suicide.
It is all the result of the rule-or-ruin policy of the greatest
of American grandstanders, Teddy the Noisy, whose ideas and
desires he fondly imagines should be dominant, no matter what
might be the result to the 100,000,000 people of the greatest and
grandest country on earth. Rule-or-ruin is his motto and his
creed. Teddy never was of the "if you can't-lick-'em-jine-'em"
class, and he again demonstrated this fact in these noisy days of
strife and turmoil in the Windy City on the banks of Lake Michigan.

TWO TREFZ STORIES
And They Are Good Ones, No Matter
If Trefz Was Discredited
Here
Edwin F. Trefz is well known in St.
Joseph. He had a meteoric career
here, first as pastor of the English
Lutheran church, which is now the
voose headquarters, just above the
postoffice on Edmond street, and later
as editor of the old St. Joseph Herald.
In both places he pulled off "some
Btunts," and when it became a little
sultry here he departed for greener
pastures. He 1b now in about his
proper sphere, for he is connect
ed with the Chamber of Commerce of
the United States, where a person Is
licensed to act almost as he pleases.
But that Is not the story for a
story or rather two of them follow.
Trefz told them at an Omaha ban
quet, Thursday, and here they are:
"Recently," he said, "a clergyman
living Just outside Minneapolis' phoned
urgently to a bookstore in that city
for a copy of 'Stekers After God.'
" 'I haven't got a copy in stock,' the
bookseller phoned back, 'but I'll tele
graph to Chicago, and if they haven't
got it I'll have them try to get it from
New York for you.'
"A little later tho bookseller re
ceived a wire from Chicago, as fol
lows: lr& "No seekers after God In New
York or Chicago. Try Philadelphia."
After the laughter had died down
the speaker told this one on Chicago:
- out west, at a garment manu-
- convention, and ono of

" "Why, certainly; but that is within
the city limits there,' she retorted.
SIXTY PER CENT, PAID
Collector Ed M. Harber Says That He
Is Pleased With the Way Income
Tax Is Coming in
Collector E. M. Harber of this dis
trict estimates there Is approximately
sixty per cent of the Income tax pay-
ers who have paid their tax. He says
his office will be so rushed with work '
the latter part of June he Is anxious'
that prompt payment be made by
those corporations and Individuals
who have not paid. Penalties are au
tomatically added for failure to pay
on time, the last day for payment be
ing June 30.
Says Collector Harbin: "Out of
bomethlng over six thousand assess
ments about twenty-five hundred have
not yet paid, and if a great portion of
these delay until the very last It will
be next to Impossible to accommodate
them, nnd tiennlttna will. its 'I hnvoi
said, be automatically Imposed, with
no power to relieve therefrom. The
collector's office Is In every Instance
anxious to avoid penalties being im
posed, but this can only be done by,
compliance with the law on the part,
of the taxpayers. It Is cratlfvine that.
so many have already paid and it Is
hoped those who have not will not)
delay. I will be glad If not a single,
penalty is imposed in this district, and
there should not be, for there is no
reason for taxpayors delnying until
penalties are Imposed. It is agreed
by all this country was ncjver In moro
prosperous condition, and there It
scarcely a district where returns have
been more" prompt, Increase moro grat
ifying, br Indeed more prosperous than
this tho Sixth district of Missouri."
JOHN E. COONS CALLED
One of the Old and Respected Citizens
of Platte County Is Called
Away
A number of St. Joseph people wore
In Dearborn last Sunday, called there
by the death of one of Its most re
spected citizens, John E. Coons, who
was called away after a brief Illness.
The deceased was a native of Platte
county, having lived In that section
since his birth, Oct. 9, 1847, and by
his grand qualities of heart and mind
had endeared himself to all, and his
taking away came as a shock and blow
to his hundreds of friends.
The funeral services were conducted
from the Christlr.n church on Sunday
afternoon and were in charge of the
Masonic order of which he was a loved
and respected member.
The deceased leaves three sisters
and one brother, two half-sisters and
three half-brothers. The deceased was
twice married and leaves three chil
dren by his first wife, one of them be
ing Edwin, bookkeeper in the St. Jo
seph postoffice; and he also leaves
three children by his second wife.
He was a man whom all were proud
to number among their friends and
the Immense assemblage of those to
attend the last honors was a silent and
touching testimonial of his sterling
worth.

"THE COLORED BROTHER"
His "Republican Friends" as
Usual Bump Him When It
4 Comes to Honors
J 4 "Chicago, June 8. The rules
committee of the Republican con-
ventlon decided against Dr J.
R. Crossland and In favor of W.
c. Hueston as alternate for for-
mer Governor Herbert S. Had-
iCy. Crossland offered to split the
honor and divide the time with
Hueston, but Hueston declined.
There Is no appeal. Most of the
Missouri delegation admits that
Crossland was entitled to the
place."
When LIv Morse dominated the
Republican state convention at
Excelsior Springs .which selected
the delegates and alternates to
the Chicago convention he threw
out a sop to tho "colored broth
er" by selecting all alternates
from the colored ranks. It was
stated by this paper at that time
that Dr. J. R. A. Crossland of this
city would be sidetracked along
with all of the other "colored
brothers' when the convention
6at as'the Republican party cared
nothing for the colorsd
man out-
side of his voting power when
an election came on.
Is this not true? Dr. Cross

4 and best qualified colored men in
St. Joseph and ho was the

TERNATE TO TAKE THE
PLACE OF HERnY HADLEY.

4 and won by a majority of 116.
This, will keep Platte In the
"wet" column.
Considerable Interest was man
4 lfeitod and many of our citizens
watched to see how Hon. James
H. Hull, Platte county's candl-
date for the nomination for con
4 gress, would vote. He has usually

4 umn, but Bince be has begun his

4 can tell where he stands. Much
4 to the disappointment of ythe
4 people here, Hull decided that

4 ducked down to Hlgglnsvllle and

4 dant opportunity to come home

ON THE PAY ROLL
Several Clinton County Wiley's Seem
t to Have Drawn a Few
Shekels
The following Wileys were on the
clerical force of the last legislature:
Lillian Wiley $ 259.00
Nellie Wiley 259.00
Mamie Wiley 259.00
T. L. Wiley 413.00
Total $1,190.00
Sister Mary is a clerk, and Mabel, two
years older,
Un(jle Peter's only child, has got a
tf& a'sfolder. - - -
Cousin Charley is a page; like lots of
other pages,
He never pages anyone, but simply
draws his wages.
Aunt Carrie has a job that doesn't
keep her humping,
And payday Is the only time when
you can see her jumping.
Uncle Billy's on the roll as messen
ger he's listed;
He really didn't want the place, but
Cousin Jim Insisted.
Mamma has a clerkship, too, and so
has little Willie,
Although to do a lick of work they
would consider silly.
Papa's uncle's cousins niece, the one
they nicknamed Lazy,
Gets five a day for chewing gum, at
which she Is a daisy.
The folders never fold a thing; the
clerks they do no clerking.
And yet the records plainly show
that they are all a-worklng.
It may look queer, but you'll allow
that It Is human nature,
When Cousin John and Uncle SI are
In the legislature.

DON'T GUESS B. SUNDAY
Guess as Much as You Desire, But
You Will Not Hit the "Evan.
gelist" at Any Angle
There was once a minister of
the
gospel who never built a church.
He never preached in one.
. Who never proposed a church fair
to pay the debts with which the
church was burdened.
Who never founded a new sect.
Who was known to have drank wine
with sinners.
Who never received a salary.
Who never asked for one.
Who never wore a black suit or a
white necktie.
Who never used a prayer book, or a
hymn book, or wrote a sermon.
Who never hired great musicians or
singers to draw people to hear the
word.
Who never went through a course
of theological study.
Who never was ordained.
Who never was converted.
Whose abiding places were always
among the poor.
Who made no distinction between
sinful men and sinful women.
Do you know who this strange
preacher was?
Misses Mary and Gladys Sewell left
early this week for their homo In
M.tryvllle, Mo., after a week's visit
