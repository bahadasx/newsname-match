Unexpected Rush to Market
This Week Doubles Re
ceipts of Last Week.
Another season-end rush of tobacco
this week ran the loose floor receipts
up to more than 4C0.C00 pounds and
prices were almost up to last week,
the average being only 13 cents less.
There was no weakness in the mark
et, tho difference being due to the
quality of tho offerings. The loose
floor sales are now double ,those of
last year at this time. Much of the
tobacco now coming in is from a dist
ance and there is complaint in some
quarters that low contract sales are
being jumped and tho tobacco sold
for the higher prices prevailing.

ALL OVER BUT THE WALLOPING THEY ARE TO GET IN NOVEMBER
Suffrage For Women is Endorsed by Republicans but Right
of Each State to Settle Question For Itself is Affirmed
Full Platform Adopted as Proposed.
Chicago, III., June 9. The repub
lican presklental nominee will be
Justice Hughes. He will be endorsed
by Theodore Roosevelt. The pro
gressive party will be wiped off the
face of the map. Roosevelt has noti-
ficd his leaders here he will absolutely
refuse to run as a progressive or in-
dependent candidate for president.
The republican convention last
night accepted the invitation of the
progressive convention to a confer
ence for harmony. The proposal to
that end, adopted first in tne progres-
sive convention, was received in the
republican convention and adopted
with a few scattering "noes," and
virtually no demonstration.
Senator Reed Smoot, of Utah; Sen
ator William E. Borah, of Idaho;!
former Senator W. Murray Crane, of i
Massachusetts; Nicholas Murray But-:
ler, of the New York delegation, and
former Representative A. B. Johnson,
of Ironton, Ohio, were appointed as
the republican conference committee.
They at once began arrangements for
meeting the progressives.
Chairman Robins appointed as
members of the progressive confer
ence committee George W. Perkins,
Governor Hiram Johnson, Horace
Wilkins, Charles J. Bonaparte and
John M. Parker. No limit of time
has been set.
The complexion of the republican
committee was generally regarded as
one that would'not accept Col. Roose
velt for the presidential nomination
but on the other hand would not in
sist upon an agreement on Justice
Hughes. The whole effect of the de
velopment was to throw the republi
can nomination into uncertainty until
Roosevelt was later heard from.
PROGRESS IS ONLY REPORT.
The conferees adjourned at 12:30 a.
m., after a two hour session, with the
announcement that they would not
meet again until after the sessions of
the two conventions today. The only
statement given out was that "wo re
port progress."
This was the situation as epitomized
by one of the conferees after the con
ference had been in session a little
more than an hour.
The utmost harmony had reigned
in the meeting.
j Republicans were impressed with
'the apparant desire of the progres
! sives to effect an agreement.
I PLATFORM IS ADOPTED.
Tho other principal developments
in the republican convention were the,
adoption of the platform as reported

bythe resolution committee headed
by Senator Lodge; a half minute dem
onstration for Col. Roosevelt when
his name was mentioned for tho first
time in the convention; the perfection
of the permanent organization and
adjournment until 11 o'clock tomor-
row morning
Senator Lodge mentioned Col,
Roosevelt's name in reading the Phil
ipine plank which declares for the
policy inaugurated by McKinley and
continued by Roosevelt. The demon-
station that followed was principally
;n the galleries, although it was join-
C(i DV some delcmtcs on the floor.
Senator Lodge well identified as a
personal friend of the colonel's smiled
and waited and it subsided in less
than a minute by the watch.
SUFFRAGE INCIDENT FExVTURE
The outstanding incident of the
day's session came with Senator
Lodge's announcement of the woman
suffrage plank.
"Tne republican party reaffirming
its faith in the government of the peo
ple, by the people and for the peoplo
as a measure of Justice to one-half
the Jdult people of this country favors
the extension of suffrage to women,'
read" the senator and then he paused
while the suffragists began their
.'demonstration.
"But," continued Senator Lodge
when the poise subsided, "it recog
nizes the right of each state to settle
this question for itself."
There were roars of laughter at
this qualifying phrase to what the
suffragists had celebrated as a clear
cut victory and the convention hall
rang with the demonstration of those
who approved the qualification.
Chairman Harding of the republican
convention said that unless he is over
ruled, he will asked the convention to
go straight through with nominating
speeches as soon as the convention
convenes this morning and that all
second speeches be made after the
nominating addresses have been con
cluded and then only by arrangement
with the chairman.
About the only thing that can inter
fere with this nrouram. he said,
would be a report from the peace con
ference committee. According to
present plans there will be no fine
limit placed on nominating speeches.
Seconding speeches will be limited to
five minutes each.
Nominating speeches were being
made at 3 o'clock, Whitman starting
with Hughes.

THE TALK OF
ORGANIZATION
Reasons Given Why Tobacco
Growers Should Act In
Concert.
It is observed that there is a move
ment on foot to organize the tobacco
growers of Christian county and the
Kentuckian takes great pleasure in
tendering its columns for tho further
ance of a movement so praiseworthy
and necessary to the best interest of
our growers. The fact should not be
ost sight of for a moment that all
wealth is a product, even though in
directly of cither the soil, the forest
or the mines. Therefore in this day
of rapid strides In money making too
much attention cannot be devoted to
the subject of keening the affairs of
the agricultural class abreast all oth
ers. It is too often the case that hard
times are commented upon by the
manufacturer and merchant without
being understood to be directly at
tributable to the fact that the farmer
is getting nothing for the sweat and
toil he has put forth and his invest
ment in land, tools and teams. At
the prices which prevailed during the
sale of a very large per cent, of the
last two crops of tobacco, there has
been little or nothing to suggest cith
er profit or progress, but on the con
trary the tobacco grower who came
out even was lucky indeed. This
occurred at a time when it must have
been perfectly apparent to everyfo
that the demand for tobacco would be
greater than at any time in recent
years on account of the fact that the
European countries that are, our
heavy patrons, themselves producers
from their own soils, of more tobacco
than they purchase annually from us,
being unable to produce tobacco dur
ing the existence of the war. Where
such countries are not devastated by
the fightful progress of war the goy
ernments arc directing the production
of such cronsas will sustain life. In
stead of tobacco selling at tho ruin
ously low prices which prevailed
early in the last season it should by
every commercial law or system have
sold for double the price actually
realized. If anything else than the
prices which prevailed early in the
present sale season is necessary to
convince the grower that supply and
demand is not the factor in the price
making and if anything else than the
same price is noccssary to convince
the grower that if he does not take an
active part in the malcing of reasona
ble prices for his own product tliat
nobody else will and that in such
event good prices are exceedingly Im
probable, we do not understand his
basis of roasoning. It simply is not
possible to even approach a solution
of this momentous question in any
other way than by organization.
Some thirty prominent and highly
' esteemed Christian county farmers
have taken the initiative in this hirJa
' ble movement for organization and it
is to be hoped that every other farm
er in the county will cheerfully and
j earnestly rally to their support. The
Planters Protective Association was
once thoroughly established among
us and no one can gainsay the fact
that it came among us at the time of
the growers' deepest dospondence,
almost doubling the price of tobacco
in nn astonishingly short time. To
bo sure it was crudo at that time, and
( not a few complaints were suggested,
but it served a great purpose in
greatly advancing the price of tobac
co, we are informed that the aggre
gate of tho business done by it in tho
seemingly few years of its existence
was approximately $52,000,000.00
To thoso who recall the fact that the
average price for tobacco was less
.than four
cents and that in an as-
tonishably short time it was nine or
1 1 ! L 1 1 1 I 1
, ien cents u musi ue npiweni mo as-
sociation has added something like
?25,0U0,aw.UO to the total wealth of
the dark tobacco district of Kentucky
and Tennessee, comprising about
thirty counties. Is anything else
necessary to commenco such un or
ganization? Had not one better ask
how can any grower afford not to
sustain it?
