The selection of Justice Hughes
came as Colonel Roosevelt had made
an eleventh hour attempt to swing a
compromise candidate for both his
own bull moose party and the G. O.
P. in the person of Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. It
was perfectly apparent that the repub
lican delegates proposed to rut their
own steam roller over the otonel's
aspirations this year. Selection of
the "silent man" of present day Amer
ican politics, was celebrated by the
usual convention uproar and parade
of the state standards. There wa a
brief but roof-raising bit cf applause
and then everybody stood up aiid
talked and clapped hands in their en
thusiasm. California, with its state
banner, led the parade of the states
through the hall. Hughes' nomination
on an early baLlot was indicated as
early as midnight when Senator Sher
man withdrew and asked that his
fifty-eight delegates vote for the su
preme court justice. Ohio next bwuii?
in line and then Just before the con
vention opened, Indiana, Iowa, Massa
chusetts, Pennsylvania and others.
Senator Weeks, the only favorite son
actually on the ground here, formally
withdrew shortly after the conven
tion met, appearing on the platform
to declare he "wore no political
scars" from his unsuccessful fight for
the presidency.
"Big Steve" Stevenson, otherwise
"Angel Archie.", national committee
man from Colorado and from the first
day of the convention a staunch
Roosevelt supporter interrupted the
ballot to announce on behalf of all
the Roosevelt delegates that they con
sidered themselves released from
such vote because of the colonel's let
ter to the progressives suggesting
Lodge as a compromise candidate.
Some of the undying Roosevelt adher
ents nevertheless cast their votes for
the former president
Make it Unanimous.
Alexander Moore of Pittsburgh. Pa.,
arose after announcement of the
vote. "I* fought to the last ditch for
the man I believed was the best
choice," he said, "but I now ask that
the nomination be made unanimous.
Senator Lodge was next to make a
similar motion.
"The convention has chosen a
strong, able, upright man and a thor
ough American," he said. He should
receive the support of every man. It
is an honor and pleasure to second
Mr. Hughes' nomination. The motion
was carried with such a thunderous
chorus of ayes that the chairman said
there was no "noes."
Massachusetts voted 32 or ner 30
votes for Hughes, Governor McCall
arising to explain that while the dele
gates appreciated the fitness of Sen
ator Lodge, suggested by Roosevelt,
they nevertheless felt the spirit of
the convention was for Hughes. Gov
ernor Willis of Ohio concurred, in
withdrawing Burton's name.
Hughes' name was given a great,

When Harding announced the next

proceeded.

"Speaking for the business men of

Howard Baldridge arose. He urged
that the west be given a place on the

Nevada next on the roll yielded to

[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
CHICAGO, June 10.—Sentiment for
a vice presidential candidate rapidly
crystalized early today with Senator
Borah of Idaho and Charles Fair
banks of Indiana, the favorites.
The choice Is largely geographical.
Borah Is the "light haired boy," of
both conventions. He is enthusiasti
cally liked by the progressives, but
at the same time has always refused
to leave the G. O. P. ranks. While
Borah for two days has refused to
yield to strong pressure urging him
to run, it is the belief of his friends
in both parties that if he received a
whirlwind nomination, the convention
would accept him with a bang before
be could protest. Fairbanks also has
sent out word that he would not ao
cept the nomination for vice presi
dent, but this haB not be»n taken as
final. The choice of a candidate for
this office promises to bring out the
customary number of names, but Fair
banks and Borah have the edge.
There is a strong desire on the part
of the delegates now to close up
shop and get home. This has been
materially strengthened by the weata
er, and the situation as a whole may
result in quick action on the vico
presidency with the list of candidates
somewhat curtailed.
Sherman Quit Next.
[By 3. D. Groat, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
CHICAGO, June 10.—The second
break in the ranks of the favorite
sons came early today. Following the
withdrawal of Governor Brumbaugh
after the first 'ballot yesterday, the
managers of Lawrence Y. Sherman
gave up the ship about dawn. Illi
nois will join the Hughes forces on
the first ballot today and Sherman
delegates scattered elsewhere are
expected to follow. Other breaks in
the allied ranks are expected soon
after balloting is under way until
the field is narrowed down to three
or flour men.
Favorite eons row was not a cherry

few hours rest after a series of long
conferences, but it was evident the
pow-wows had availed nothing in the
way of a combination to 'head off/
Hughes. The managers of Burton/
Fairbanks, Cummins and Root wer,
ready to renew .the battle, but thr
had not agreed on one of the numr
to be the recipient of their comlbi'
strength. I
Individually, they declared It -1
sible to prolong the contest by con
tinuing as they began—each favorite
son for himself, but none was willing
to say Hughes might not win if an
attempt wast made to narrow the
fight to Hughes and one favorite
son. Overtures were made during
the night by Hughes managers, first
to this favorite and then to that,
offering them the vice presidency if
it would deliver their strength to
Hughes. The vice presidential bait
did not appear attractive, as all
realized the moment they began dick
ering for second pdaoe their chance
for first plpace would go glimmering
A number of definite plans were un
deT consideration by the favorite son
managers today. One of them was to
start a movement for Senator WaT
ren G. Harding in the hope that the
favorite son delegates might be able
to comibine on him and thus defeat
Hughes. Another was to test out
the vote getting ability of one favor
ite son and then the other in an ef
fort to discover the strongest.
Several members of tho Ohio dele
gation said the Cummins managers
had offered to throw the Oummins
strength to Harding, provided the
Burtonites would do the same.
Uninstructed delegations were be
ing watched by the managers of every
favorite son entrant. Word was
coming in early today that first one
uninstructed state and then another
would break away and go tot Hughes.

CHICAGO, June 10.—Justice Chas.
Evans Hughes will probably be

Frank Hitchcock, volunteer Hughes
captain, indicated early today his be
lief that the former New York gov
ernor might be named with one al
ditional roll call.
A conference of the "olive branch'"
committee of republicans and pro
gressives at 9 o'clock was the last
effort to effect a truce ?,nd in the
view of leaders, it was foredoomed
to failure, just as a prolonged discus
sion Of the night had developed a
deadlock—the progressives standing
pat on Roosevelt as the bull mooso
price of amalgamation, and the repub
licans proffering in his stead any one
of a dozen favorite sons, dark horses
and possibilities. Last night's confer
ence adjourned ,at 2:30 a. m., both
sides amiable but adamant.
What has induced the republican
committeemen to stand out strongest
against Roosevelt, was the insignifi
cant showing which the former presi
dent made on the two ballots of yes
terday. Only 65 votes were cast for
him on the first roll call and only 80
on the second Hughes polling about
four times as many delegates. Dur
ing the long day of frenzied excite
ment and oratory It was noticeable
that most of the cheering for Roose
velt came from the galleries and a
goodly portion of the hisses from the
floor whereon are seated the ^ctual
voters of the meeting.
It was a night of conferences and
last ditch planning. The allies could
not agree on any one favorite son.
Suggestions that Sherman switch
fifty Illinois votes which are his. to
Hughes, broke up the conference
shortly after 3 a. m. None are par
ticularly sanguine after this news of
holding, let alone gaining in their
delegates. The forces it becama
known, when the allies got together,
have been sounding out every onj
of the favorite sons on the question
of the vice presidency. Althougn
every ally leader today indignantly
disclaimed any acceptance of a second
choice deal, it was nevertheless fair
to assume that any one of at least
four favorite sons would be perfectly
willing to take the half loaf if it was
proffered.

The Die Was Cast.
[By H. L. Rennick, United Press Sta£!

AUDITORIUM, CHICAGO, June 10.
—Progressive delegates poured into
the Auditorium today primed to nomi
nate Theo. Roosevelt for president
before noon. Many leaders considered
the die cast and that they were
through with dickering. Governor
Hiram Johnson of California and John
M. Parker of Louisiana who refuse*!
to go into the conference with the
republicans were ready to start tho
fireworks at.once.
The convention was called to order
at 10:42 with an air of suppressed
excitement.
Robins announced the convention
would go ahead deliberately with the
proper order of business. There wi'.l
be no more stalling, he said.
Monsignor Fitzsimmons of Chicago
delivered the invocation.
Chester Rowell of California took
the platform and told the convention
the state chairmen were waiting at
the Blaclcstone for a conference with
Perkins and had asked the convention
to wait until they arrived at ths
Auditorium.
"How soon will they be here?" tha
delegate yelled impatiently.
"Five or ten minutes."
The conference committee reached
the Auditorium at 11:10.
Perkins went direct to the plat
form. "If the chair Tecognizes in3

said Perkins.

The Third Ticket.
[By H. L. Rennick, United (Press"Staff
Correspondent.
CHICAGO, June 10.—Convinced
that all conferences, proposals and
counter proposals, are unavailing,
progressive radicals entered the bull
moose convention today, determined,
to nominate a candidate for presi
dent. A third ticket in the field was
considered an absolute certainty.
George W. Perkins met the chair
man of the various state delegations
In his rooms at the Blackstone at 8:0®
a. m.
Perkins called the conference for
the single purpose of learning jnst
what the various delegations would
accept in the way of proposals look«
Ing toward the retirement of the pro
gressives from the field. He was to
suggest that the word might be re
ceived from T. R. and was to inquire
to do If the colonel should declare h«
did not want to make another race as
a third party candidate. There was a
feeling that the radical element in
the convention mi^ht force the nomi
nation of Roosevelt with or without
his consent. Chester Rowell of Fres
no, who has been one of Perkins' lieu
tenants, declared early today that the
nomination of Roosevelt was certain.
As a matter of courtesy, the conven
tion will await the final report of the
"peace" committee, but after that
the fireworks will star.t. At all events
whether the colonel or some one else
—most likely Governor Johnson, of
California—is chosen, a third ticket
will be in the field, the radicals de*
clare.
Perkins had planned to ask the
state chairmen whether the dele
gates would consent to hold off from
nominating until Monday, providing
T. R. appeared here to address the
republicans. This is now out of the
question, however, as it is realizel
the republicans are going right
through.
Conferences continued today right
up to the hour the convention opened.
