HOKAII HELPS TO
COXTKOL HOTHEADS
Chicago, June !. A battle of strategy
was fought nil day by tho Progressive
leaders with their own convention on
the one hand and the Republican- con
tention on the other. There has leldom
been anything like It In American politi
cal history.
The object of tills game of strategy
which George V. Perkins nnd his aids,
moMt of them the personal friends of
Theodore Roosevelt, played here to-day
was ;
1. To hold the Uull Moose convention
from nominating Col. ltoosevelt and a
third ticket pending the tlrst b.illotliiK of
the Republicans, so as to afford oppor
tunity for further ronfeioncon by the
two committees, these committees having
Wen continued by their respective con
tentions. This part of the plan rested
on the hope that the Republicans, as a
result of the tight In their own conten
tion, would dually be swung nround to
take Itooi-etelt.
2. To nominate Col. Hoosctelt before
;,vi,0(y vlv ,,an Roocve!t coubl be
iiwiutnntcd by the Republican eonven
tlon, the Hull Moose convention, with
this In view, being kept In sisslon.cxccpt
when It was thought safe to take short
recesses.
Tu lrei Their I'lrdxr.
The Moose did not want to hate theli
contention put Into a position of accept
ing or rejecting the actual nominee of
the Republican contention should he be
other than ltousetelt, adhering thus to
their January statement and to the
"' .i...J'V.'
resntatlte. at the conference.
At the I
,,, time they did not want to Destroy
any chance the Colonel might have us u '
c'.in(llil.tt to unite the parlies.

Not until to-night wa It disclosed that

Applause for Hughes and Root Evenly Divided

tion of Roosevelt Old Time Oratory for
Burton, Fairbanks and Cummins.
CHICAGO, June 9. The Republican convention sat for almost
eleven hours to-day without taking u recess. Nine hours of this session
were occupied with nominating speeches. Two hours were spent in bal
loting. Only two ballots were taken, Charles K. Hughes having on the
second 327 ti votes, or 167 short of nomination.
The adjournment was forced by the pnrtisans of the favorite sons
and of Col, Roosevelt. Senator Penrose's motion to adjourn was sup
ported by n vote of 694 as aguinst 286 for a continuation of the
balloting. The third ballot will be' taken at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning.
There was a whiff of ozone in the atmosphere of the Republican
national convention when the Coliseum filled this morning. Some breeze
had cleared the sultry air. There was more bustle and stir, more enthu-
siasm, more optimism than was perceptible in previous sessions. Excite-
merit over tho approaching hour of
the keener tang. There was a fight in sight, even though it must be
preceded by seven hours of nominating speeches and thousands of words,
words, words.
There was preliminary interest also in the report of the peace com
mittee Messrs. Crane, Dutler, Johnson, Koran and Smoot. What would
it have to say? Had these ten gentlemen meeting so amiably at the
Chicago Club accomplished anything'.' They were soon to hear.
An Episcopalian, Hishop William McDowell, offered the prayer, and
an excellent prayer it was. worthy of more attention than it received

Chairman Harding, whose physical resemblance to William McKinlcy
becomes more striking with his every appearnnce upon the platform, an-
nounced that the special peace committee was ready to report. Reed
Smoot of Utah came to the front nnd read the report. It was disappoint-
ing for actual, definite results accomplished, but it left the door open to
more harmony work.

Justice's Roomers Predict His Victory by
the Fourth Ballot To-day.
CHICAGO, June 10 (2 A. M.). Charles Evans Hughes, Associate
Justice of the United States Supreme Court, has the lead for the Republi
can Presidential nomination over any other candidate by 230 votes. That
was the result on tho second ballot in the Republican convention which
was taken last night. Justice Hughes gained 75 votes on this ballot over his
total on the previous roll cull and his managers were predicting that
another ballot would result in his nomination, when a vote for adjourn
ment was put through.
The vote to adjourn wns carried by (594 li to 2811I2. Tin Hughes
people stood out against adjournment, but the vote could not be regarded
as a real test inasmuch as the delegates had been in session since 11
o'clock in the morning and were insistent upon postponing further ballot
ing until to-day.
Root Second; 81 Votes for T. R.
When the. voting ended fur the night Elihu, Root of New York va
running with the next largest vote. Mr. Root, second ballot, 99 ti, m
compared with 328'i for the jurist. The ox-Senator had lost 4ti votes
from the first ballot, whereas Mr. Hughes had picked up 75,
Col. Roosevelt on the second ballot had only 78 votes in the Repub
lican convention, but he had mado a gain of 14 from the first roll call.
After the night's balloting the conference committees of the Repub
lican and Progressive conventions got together again. At 1 o'clock this
morning the harmony committees were deadlocked. The Hull Moosers
were still standing by Col. Roosevelt and refusing to consider anybody
else. The Republicans refrained from submitting any names. They said
.l-..!. 111 ? ,,. w ., .
tnai 11 tvouio ne impossible ior mem to present any man s name as a pos
sible compromise so long as the number cf candidates before the Repub
lican convention was so, large.
The two committees finally separated to confer bv themselves with
1 the understanding that they would come together again for a final ex
! change of view. It looked like an all night conference.
' Allies in Anti-Hughes Caucuses.
' At 1 :30 o'clock this morning the allies had entered a conference in
the hope of reaching another agreement which would prolong tho dead
I lock. The result of the conference will be put up to many of the favorite
jsons delegates in the nioniinf tt'.u-n they meet for final caueusoi.
i The State chairmen ol" the Progressive party are to meet in Mr.
1 Perkins's rooms at the lllackstone at S A. M. to-day. They have served

he cannot refuse the nomination.
Talk of Fairbanks or Sherman.

fearful that the adjournment would give an opportunity for the allies to
make deals. Kx-Senntor Fairbanks nf Indiana and Senator Sherman of
Illinois were being talked of as possibilities on whom the allies migh',
try to unite.
The general belief heie to-night is that the Vice-Presidency will g,.
to Fairbanks if Hughes is chosen.
