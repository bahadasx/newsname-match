Chicago, June 9. Keeping faith
with the promise implied in the agrce
nieiit reached by the republican and
progressive harmony conference both
conventions today did just what they
were expected to do.
Notwithstanding predictions and
prophecies that one or the othcrwotihi
get out of hand or do something; sur
prising, nothing unexpected happened.
The republicans met, listened to nom
inating' speeches, took the two prom
ised ballots without a nomination and
adjourned until 11 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
The progressives not an hour be
fore nnd well in hand followed the
program laid down by the managers.
They debuted the platform, kept tab
on the Coliseum, listened to the ef
forts of their best orators, aiid when
word came that the republicans had
adjourned without making a nomina
tion they adjourned until 10:110 to
morrow trio in I in:.
On the heels of the en, of the two
sessions, the conference committee

The New Mexico delegation voted

both times.
Ten Hour Session.
In ten continuous hours the dele
gates today sat through eleven nomi
nating speeches which presented Jus
tice Hughes, Klihu Koot, former Sen
ator Uurton, Senator Weeks, T. Colt-
man I)u Pont, Senator Sherman, for
mer Senator Fairbanks, Senator Cum
mins, Colonel Hoosevelt, Senator La
Kollette and Governor l.rumbaugli.
There were a various number of sec
onding speeches. Ten had been
planned for Colonel Hoosevelt and
although Chairman Harding agreed
to recognize thorn nil, they did not all
appear. The demonstrations as can
didates were nominated were the
usual cheering, roaring, marc hing af
fair. Huring the uproar that greeted the
nomination of Hoosevelt the police
had to be sent to the galleries to stop
women from tearing bunting from the
railings. Otherwise, the demniiHtra-
tion. although nosiy and prolonged,
were good natured and orderly.
Work to Kml Today.
Tomorrow the convention leader
expect to dispose of both presidential
and vice presidential nominations.
When the delegates take their seats
at H o'clock for the third ballot, it
will be Hughes against the field.
The total vote of the convention
fixed by the credentials committee at
HS9 wait reduced to 9S7 because the
two Porto Riean delegates failed to
qualify. This reduced the number
necessary for a nomination to 494 in
stead of 4'J5, as previously had been
announced.

Americans and through this action
any loyal American may be nominated
here.
"Mr. ChalrmaiK ladies and gentle
irien," he said, "this convention has
adopted a platform which every loyal
American citizen can support in the
cuming election, and upon which any
loyal American citizen can become a
candidate for the votes of his fellow
citizens. You have declared your in
tention respecting the internal policies
of this couuntry, and you have also
gone upon record in most unequivocal
language respecting the foreign policy
which you propose to adopt.
I'orelmi Policy Vital.
"I want to call your attention for
a moment to the fact that an internal
policy may be changed, may be re
pealed, may be amended at any mo
ment, and for only a moment possibly,
or for a short space the general wel
fare of the country affected. Hut, fol

Tin' Kyes of the World. j
"The eyes of the leaders of all thej
great warring nations are upon thej
proceedings of this convention today.
The-hopes of every neutral nation In
the world are with you in your pro
ceedings that you may secure for
them and for yourselves able and ef
fective leadership in the protection
of their neutral and your neutral
rights. The prayers of every one of
your fellow citizens are being? offered
today for- your success that in your
deliberations you limy unite under
one banner and under one leader
those voters of this country who have
at heart,' not the welfare of one sec
tion but the welfare of the entire
country who are endowed by the
spirit of those who made this country
and of those her ics who preserved it.
"One Colossal l lgiirc."
"Fellow citizens, In the vision nf
every leader of those great warring
factions there appears one colossal
figure of American manhood. On
the crest of the hope, of every neutral
nation there is borne one of one
great American. In the prayer of
every American praying for that suc
cess here today, ull hough in the heart
of that Americun may lie the favored
name of some favored son, there s
yet whispered the name of one great
American.
"Mexico, torn by civil strife, pros
trate and bleeding, has made her plea
to you, and nobly the republicans have
responded," said Senator Fall. "You
have given them your promise and
every American who lives, who has
suffered in Mexico, pleads with you to
select as your leader the one man
whom they all know will effectively
carry out your promise.
Tlie Appeal of Mo.lt.
"Starving mothers in Mexico who
will bear the promise which you have
made, will put their hope in one
American, and one alone, ami that is
Theodore Hoosevelt. ''
(At this point the speaker was in
terrupted by cries for Mr. Hughes
and Chairman Harding called for or

the republican organization, or direct,
emphatic word froni Mr. Kocsevi It
himself that the progressive nomina
tion would not be accepted.
For hours today the leaders of
the convention staved off a nomina
tion that they knew, and every dele
gale in the hall knew, as crowding
forward with the hours themselves,
and could no more be stopped than
on avalanche if once the convention
was assured that the last hope of
peace with republicans was gone and
Mr. Roosevelt's nomination at the
Coliseum could not be accomplished.,
After three sessions that ran through
the gaiiuil of emotions, from hywle
lla for .Mr, Roosevelt to n calm, dis
passionate discussion of planks in th"
platform, the convention pdjopined
at !i:fiS tonight until 10:30 tomorrow.
It was only after repeated assurances
from the leaders that Colonel Roose
velt himself desired that the nomina
tion bo. postponed and oratory that
played upon their good nature, that

All day the delegates kept on guard
while the leaders watched or listened I
over the telephone to detect any un-
expected move on the part of the re
publicans. As the ballots were taken
In the Coliseum they wailed and lis
tened and kept their tempers. They
were told they must "keep the faith"
and allow two ballots to be taken by
the republicans, according to the
agreement between the peace con-
ierces and approved by Colonel
Roosevelt himself. The approval of
th colonel was a trump card held up
the sleeves of the leaders, but never
played, for when the Coliseum quit
for the nighi the delegates, tired out
with long sitting In the hot, sticky
theater, w'civ willing to wait for a
nomiualion.
"Twenty-four hours more won't
make any difference," said !ov. Hi
ram W. Johnson. The crowd agreed
and accepted the motion to adjourn.
There was little routine business
business during the day. The plat
form was tentatively agreed upon
with only a lew changes.
Prohibition I lea Ion.
A fight to insert a prohibition plunk
was beaten by a vote of 523 to S2
after the leaders had explained at
length that to put It in meant, that
prohibition and not Americanism
would then become the main issue
of the coming campaign.
For the rest, the delegates Just
cheered and listened. Realizing that
nil outbreak might be averted only by
keeping them In good humor, the
leaders recognized man after man In
the hall, called them to the platform,
and allowed them to play on the
crowd's good nature anil its sene of
humor.
llefore adjournment the delegate
were told of the results of the first
two ballots at the Coliseum. They
look comfort from the vote for Mr.
Hoosevelt and the motion to end the
session was unopposed.

The Maine delegation started an

Mr. Vincent said the delegutes

he said, "we will proceed to execute
