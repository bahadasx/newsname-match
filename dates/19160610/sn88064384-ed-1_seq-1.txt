I Have a 3400 r. p. m. Ready This Minute For You
This certainly is a great year f r :
cars. Most everybody has had s:
Some more than others, as is always tk
Chalmers sales are running 9C0 \.
ahead of last year all oyer the United. 1
Mr. Chalmers' foresight^ . _
ing against a shortage o 1 materials L
a great contest.
It has enabled the Chalmers plant to
keep on building cars when one c.r two
have shut down or others have had to cut
down on allotments to their dealers.
Here it is June and the great Chalmers
plant is running day and night, three shills,
turning out more cars than ever before.
How long can Chalmers keep baling i ue
demand?
I don't know. I know only thru the
plant is turning out about Ï25 a day ; C bh
mers dealers are selling about 425 a day.
The only reason Ï rr any ether dealer
can supply a car now is because curing
December, January and bchruarv the
Chalmers plant worked day and n hf rv
Trojans and built about i2o ' - y
when the dealers were selling yen )jVo:.v
about 80. Scon these 425
.big to cat up the surplus made during
\ » niter montiis.
ct a letter a few days ago from the
nan plant which simply said: "We
c.:i hand orders asking for immediate
ch cars whose value is in excess of
' 7
need not narrate the rest of the note
kkh vas so obviously subtle that I got
• .. L ,i n[ li operators on the job right off!
i n making my promises on delivery
• : . ■ y to day. I've got cars or can get
.; now. This may nut hold good to
rn. row.
Next week I shall cut my promises down
slid more- Remember, there are only two
things that I concern myself with these
days. One is to get you to take one ride
in a o-lCO r. p. m. Chalmers if you have not
done so already. That's all 1 want. The car
speaks in a language you'll understand.
The other thing is simply one of math
ema'bs: .1ft lie Chalmers factory can turn
out V'5 <'-i a day and Chalmers dealers all
over lie i Mired States are selling 425 a
day. how mug will the supply last?
