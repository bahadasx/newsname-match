JUSTICE MEETS DEFEAT
IN ADJOliTOIENT VOTE
Kffort of Hughes .Adherents to
Force Continuation of Ballot?
ing Beaten, 694 to 286.
BOTH CONVENTIONS WILL
MEET AGAIN THIS MORNING
Whitman Predicts Justice Will Win in To
day's Balloting?Perkins Refuses to Pre
dict Outcome of Harmony Conference.
i Proa r\ S.afT Contvpondent of Tlie Tribune |
Chicago, June 9.?One more day was given for conciliation
between the Republican and Progressive conventions to-night,
when, over the opposition of the Hughes men, the Republican con?
vention adjourned without a nomination, after Hughes had failed
lo win on the second ballot.
The two ballots taken before adjournment showed the
Hughes strength, in a gain from 253 */% to 328-2 votes, and that
without any serioiu break in the favorite son muster. W. Murray
Crane attempted to shift the Massaehusetts delegation, but eould
get only twelve votes for the Justice. Michigan gave him ?U but
two of her thirty, and he picked up the rest from the uninatructed
delegates.
The 460 which the Hughes people had claimed for the second
ballot was far from developing, but they are confident to-night that
as soon as the conciliation committee has made its report the Jus?
tice will win.
VOTE A TEST FOR HUGHES.
The vote on adjournment was considered a test for Hughes,
but the count of 694 ? \ to 28611 failed to show his full strength.
It did show that he will not be nominated till the leaders have de
c*ded that there is no further hope of compromise, and also that he
is far away the strongest candidate if they do decide on a break.
The Progressive convention adjourned when it heard the results of
the balloting.
Immediately the conciliation committee resumed its work, but
with slight hope of success. The two parties apparently are doing
little more than make a reeord for campaign use.
The Republican convention will meet again to-morrow morn?
ing at 11 o'clock, while the Progressive delegates will be called to
order half an hour earlier.
There is an element among both so anxious for the defeat of
Wilson that it is really seeking a compromise, but for the most part
the delegates are determined??on the one side, that it shall be
Roosevelt or no one, and, on the other, tha/ft shall be any one but
Roosevelt.
Governor Whitman of New York to-night asserted that
Hughes would be nominated to-morrow. "The peace conference
to-night will be futile," he said. "There is no prospect of an agree
ment, and Justice Hughes will be named as standard bearer of the
Republicans to-morrow on the third or fourth ballot."
"I hesitate to predict the results of the conference to-night,"
said George W. Perkins.
