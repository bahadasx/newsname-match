If you could look into a million lames
Could you look into one home
in every twenty in America
and see in all of them a coffee
being served that is good
enough to make breakfast as
tiappy as this
If you saw all these homes
using the same coffee
You would never rest until
you had tried that coffee.
Your grocer has it for you
Arbuckles. It is by far thai
most popular coffee sold in
America today !
Like the women in these mil
lion homes, you will find that
Arbuckles' has the rich, full
flavor you have always
wanted.
Until you serve it you will
never know how much pleas
ure coffee can give.
To supply the women of America with their favorite
coffee, ships of Arbuckles' Coffee are on the sea every
day, bringing coffee from the coffee growing coun
.tries to their big plant on the New York waterfront.

HOW CATARRH IS
CONTRACTED
Mothers are sometimes so
thoughtless as to neglect the
colds which their children con
tract. The inflammation of the
raucous membraue, at first acute,
becomes chronic cuVarrh, a di
sease that is seldome cured and
that may prove a life'r burden
j Many persons who has this
loathsome disease will remem
ber having had frequent colds
at the time it was contracted.
A little forethought, a botile of
Chamoerloin's Cough Remedy
judiciously used and this trouble
might have been avoided. Ob

A REMINDER.
Pine Hill, Ky., Sept. 3. To the
church and especially the mes
sengers present at our last an
nual meeting of the Rockcastle
Baptist Associatio n.the messengers
from a number of churches a
greed to try to raise certain a
mounts to pay on are for one
acre of land owned bv the Bap
tist of Rentucky, Known as the
Kentucky Baptist Childrens Home
located at Glendale, Ky. I be
lieve all told $100. from this as
sociation was pledged, enough
to pay for one acre of the farm.
Now brethern lets get busy and
raise this money, while the
wheather is good and every
thing plentiful, and gat it in by
Christmas. This home deserves
our hearty support. To my
thinking this is the best Home
tn the state; the children are
taught the scripture with a view
to the early leading to Christ,
provided with educat.onal ad
vantages, taught In practical do
mestic and industrial pursuits.
And other wise prepared for self
support and independence in life,
to the end -that thev may hnally
be sent forth from the home into
the world to become useful and
inteligent members of society
active and proficient in the dis
charge of christian citizenship.
Notice some of the things . The
religious parentage of children
does not bar them from admission
into he home. Children of one
living parent may not be adopted
exce pt by consent of the parent.
Two children mu 'never be sep
arated by adoption. Children
who are left to the home by the
will of the parent at death shall
never be adopted from the home.
Space will not allow me to tell
all about this horns, hut will
say we have bought a nice farm
for the children and we owe a
balance and this Association
wants to pa for one acre $100.
I hope every messenger will
