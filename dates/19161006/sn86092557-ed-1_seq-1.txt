HATFIELD STILL
AFTERJQRNWELL
Governor Riddles Democrat
ic Candidate's Tax
i Talk.
(Special Dispatch to West Virginian)
CHARLESTON, W. Va.. Oct. 6.?
"Mr. Cornwell Is the monumental prevaricator
of the age," said Governor
Hatfield today In commenting on
statements made by Cornwell In his
address at Huntington last night. "Although
his attention has been called
to the many malicious and untruthful
statements he Is making he continues
to assert his misrepresentations."
"It is easily understood why Mr.
Cornwell refuses to accept the challenge
to meet any Republican speaker
in joint debate. His only hope is to
continue his base misrepresentations
and try and fool enough people in the
state to make him Governor.
"As an example of his misrepresentation
1 offer the following concrete
illustrations: Cornwell says it is true
that the State Board of Public tVorks
reduced the lew from 14 rants tn ft
cents this year, but declares tbat the
Increase In valuation ot properties In
the state will more than make up for
the decrease In the direct levy. Figures
that have ben carefully prepared
show that the Increase in valuation ot
this year, 1916. over 1916 with a 9cent
levy amounts to less than $8,000.
The decrease In the amount of state
and state Bchool taxes received by the
state for this year, 1916, as compared
with last year, 1916, by reasons of the
reduction In the levy from 14 cents to
9 cents, Is $678,000.
"But Cornwell would have the people
believe that less than $8,000 will
balance off the loss of $578,000. The
little amount of 670,000 makes no difference
with him In his reckless and
ridiculous assertions. The Idea that
any Increase In valuation would make
up for the reduction of 6 cents in the
state levy Is so absurd as to make his
statement fnnny, but nevertheless the
Democratic candidate, hard pressed
for material is trying to hoodwink the
peupie into oeneving iaai sucn is true
I can hardly find words to express my
contempt for such campaign tactics as
the above.
