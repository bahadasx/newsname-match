Ing room. The vessel waa nicknamed .
the "Bath Ship" inasmuch as she
had more bathrooms and shower
than the Mauretanla, this equipment ;
being Installed for the benefit of pas- '
sengers bound for long- cruises to the'
Mediterranean. The steerage of the f
Franconia was considered the best
appointed of any steamer carrying,
third class passengers. The old Idea"
of steerage compartments bad been'
eliminated and staterooms capable of
accommodating four, six. and eight -persons
had been installed.
The last report of the Franconia

(Br Associates Press.) ,
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. No new
step to end the European war has
been taken by the United States, and
so. far as officials here can foresee,
none Is likely to be taken in the near
future, according to an authoritative
statement of the government's posi
tion obtaiued in high official circles.
While no official professed to know
what is In President Wilson's mind,
it was declared that no preparations
had been made for discussion of
peace through the usual diplomatic
channels, and that all the Informa
tion gathered here seemed to indicate
that such a move would be useless
"Germany has definitely decided to
apply to the president," the article
reads, "to use his good offices in
suing for peace with the allies, it Is
learned from sources In a position to
have absolute trustworthy informa
tion in these matters. It Is under
stood that Ambassador Gerard, who
is on his way over here, will lay the
kaiser's request before the president
within a week, it is a fact, however
positively it may have been dented,
that there is possibility of the presi
dent acting as mediator, as has been
discussed by German officials with
Gerard. . It is therefore by no means
surprising that reports will take
definite shape In connection with
Gerard's trip home." Gerard is
aboard the Frederick VIII, due next

HOME RULE FOR IRELAND WILL BE SAFE
FAILURE RESULTS ON
I Br Associated Press.)
WATERFORD, Ir Oct 6. In a
notable address to bis constituents,
John Redmond, the Irish Nationalists
leader in parliament, declared that
despite the recent rebellion, "with
all its Inevitable aftermath of bru
talities, stupidities and inflamed pas
sions," home rule for Ireland Is
safe If Ireland remains sane. He
also declared that conscription could
never be forced In Ireland.
Redmond added: "I cannot bring
myself to believe, malign though the
influences working, that the govern
ment couid be insane 4nough to chal
lenge conflict with Ireland on this
subject. Conscription for Ireland is
far from helping the army and the
war. It would . be the most fatal
thing that could happen. It would be
resisted by every village In Ireland.
Its attempted enforcement would be
a scandal that would ring around the
world. It would produce no addi
tional men."
Redmond declared it was abso
lutely false that he or his colleagues
ever favored a scheme for permanent
division of the ancient nation.
