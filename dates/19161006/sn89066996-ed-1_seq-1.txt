CONGRESSMAN HENSLEY
DELIVERS GREAT SPEECH
A Crowded House Monday Night Re
sulted in a Most Enthusiastic Meeting
That Portends Democratic Victory
In response to announcement that
Congressman Walter L. Hensley
would speak in Farmington Monday
night on the issues of the present cam
paign, a great crowd filled the Cir
cuit Court room to overflowing before
the meeting was called to order. Ex
tra benches and chairs filled every
available foot of floor space in the
large room, and standing room was
soon at a premium. The audience
numbered 500 or more.
One of the most remarkable fea
tures of the meeting was that hardly
a person left the room throughout the
speaking, which lasted two hours
and thirty minutes. Gower's Boy
Band furnished excellent entertain
ment while the crowd was assembling,
after which they departed to make
room for grown-ups.
' Jerry B. Burks made the introduc
tory speech, and he was so full of his
subject it was difficult for him to reach
a stopping point, owing to the many
great and important questions that
are pressing for settlement in this
campaign. He passed briefly from
one engrossing question to another,
skimming over the surface, but car
rying his hearers with him in intense
interest.
He had thought that President Wil
son should have no opposition for re
election, that it should be made unan
imous, but such was not to be, the Re
publicans were now more nefarious
ly active, it seemed, than ever before,
urging every possible specious ar
raignment in a vain effort to discredit
and defeat for a second term one of
the greatest Presidents that has ever
occupied the Chief Executive's chair.
The applause and cheering with
which Mr. Hensley was received on
rising to speak was loud and pro
longed, indicating that his record in
Congress has brought him vary close
to the hearts of his constituency.
Such a splendid demonstration from
his home town, he said, was most
gratifying, and he appreciated it more
than his lips could express. But he
assured his auditors that, so long as
he served them, in Congress or else
where, his very best efforts would
always be at their command.
Mr. Hensley was in good voice and,
inspired by the enthusiastic recep
tion of his home people, he soon had
the audience en rapport. He traced
the political history of the nation dur
ing the nearly four years of the pres
ent administration, beginning with

HErfftY HOWELL STRUCK BY
TRAIN, SEVERELY BRUISED
Saturday evening as the 6:10 pas--engcr
train ronuded the curve just
:iorth of the depot it struck Henry
Howell, who was returning home
from work. The passenger was com
mg south and a freight train was on
the siding and approaching on the
-witch in an opposite direction to that
of the passenger train, and upon 110
; icing or hearing the freight approach,
Henry stepped to the main line, and
not perceiving the rapidly approach
ing southbound passenger, was struck
violently and hurled from the track,
sustaining severe bruises. He had
:io warning of the approach of the
passenger train, so he asserts, in time
for him to avoid the injury, as ' the
curve at this particular place is very
sharp, and the engine crew, he says,
tailed to give the usual whistle and
bell warnings. The injuries, howev
er, are not serious, and it is considered
quite miraculous that he should be
fortunate enough to escape with his
life in such an incident. The curve
.lust north of the M. R. & B. T. de
pot is very abrupt but not so much so
.is formerly, because some years ago
the company cut down the abruptness
if the curve at this place by excavat
ing ten or fifteen feet west of the
track and laying a switch there upon
which was the freight previously
spoken of. Some years ago the vol
ume of business and the number of
trains using the tracks were not near
so great as now, hence the chances
for accidents were much fewer. At
this lime when there is a heavy ton
nage of freight, numerous trains,
both freight and passcnged, and a
much denser population the opportun
ities for accidents are vastly increas
ed. Mr. Howell is a native of Iron
ounty, of this State, being born and
raised there. He has many relatives
living in Iron county, who ace pros
perous and influential citizens, and
who have learned with deep regret
of this unfortunate affair. Mr. How
ol is a single man. His friends are
lated over what seems to be a mi
aculous escape from being hurled
to a tragicc death.
SLZA JOHNSON DIES SUD
DENLYHEART FAILURE
The evening of September 28th,
about 5 o'clock, shortly after finish
mg his day's work as a carpenter at
the plant of the St. Louis Smelting
& Refining Co.. Elza Johnson died
vtry suddenly of an attack of neu
President Wilson's, attack upon the
insidious lobby that hung around
Washington, and which during Taft's
administration controlled and direct
ed legislation for the "interests", and
how, upon investigation, it was shown
that President Wilson's charge was
true. By means of his open assault
upon the" lobby and the investigation
that followed, this army of undesira
ble citizens was driven out of the
capitol.
He then took up the great measures
passed by Congress such as the cur
rency laws, the anti-trust laws, ship
ping laws, tariff laws, road laws, the
FpHprnI farm loan law. child labor
law, the eight-hour law, ahd showed
how these several laws were so con
structed as to work out the best in
terests of the great masses of the
American people.
He followed this by taking up the
record of President Wilson in rela
tion to the World's War and showed
how he had faithfully followed in
ternational law and was just and
equitable in his dealings with all the
belligerents; now Dy nis nrm dut, lair
presentation of the rights of Ameri
can citizens and commerce and all
neutrals, he won t!ie acknowledgment
of Germany that he was right, and
thus maintained peace in our own
country. He painted a grapnic wora
picture of the horrors of war and con
trasted it with the peace, plenty and
prosperity which wc" enjoy through
President Wilson's wise, firm and hu
mane policy.
Takine up the Mexican situation,
lie told how men of great wealth went)
into Mexico ana lor a song- ac
quired large and valuable conces
sions, and then when trouble arose
down there among local factions and
civil war broke out, these wealthy
I American concessionaires tried to
'push President Wilson into war with
; "Mexico that they might profit there
by at the expense of the blood of our
American youth.
Throughout his speech was a force
ful discussion of fflfc dominating is
sues of the campaign the splendid
record of President Wilson and a
constructive Democratic Congress
closing with an appeal to the citizen
ship of the country, irrespective of
party affiliation, to sustain the Pres
ident. Walter was congratulated on all
hands, a regular Democratic love
feast followed the speaking, and en
thusiasm was at high tide.
ralgia of the heart. Mr. Johnson had
been afflicted with neuralgic pains
and suffocating attacks of the heart
for some time but did not consider
his condition critical. He had un
dergone a severe spell on the Friday
preceding but had recovered and was
feeling well and hearty when he went
to work Thursday morning. He had
been employed in the capacity of a
carpenter at the mill of the company
for a good while and was an adept at
his craft. After finishing his day's
work he went with Eugene Burgess,
Wm. Olmstead and Wm. Randal to
the carpcrter shop to put their tools
away and just as he reached the shop
be was attacked with a violent spell
that proved fatal before medical aid
could arrive. Drs. Cecil and Wil
liams were called immediately but be
fore they could get to the stricken
man he had passed avay.
Mr. Johnson is survived by a fam
ily of two, m wife and one son, Jesse;,
two brothers, Alfred of this city, and
Oliver of Esther; one sister, Mrs.
Howard Counts of Flat River, and
a host of friends who deeply mourn
his untimely death. He was born and
reared in Stc. Genevieve county, of
this State. He had resided here in
this county for several years, work
ing for the Lead Belt mining com
panies, and by his firm character and
manly wavs had acquired the friend
ship of all with whom he had occa
sion to come in contact.
He was a member of the I. O. O.
F. Lodge, under whose auspices the
funeral was held Sunday. The fun
eral sermon was-preached at the, Bap
tist church by Rev. Carmichnel. The
body was laid at rest in the Pleasant

Too Strenuous
For Billy

miles east of town, while returning
from Colony Church last Sunday in
his automobile, accompanied by his
son, Billy Green, Frank Brewer, Ar
thur Denby and J. P. Evans the lat

trol of his machine, the wheels on one
side dropped into a gutter and the
rrtaehine turned completely over,
spilling them all out on the ground.
Fortunately nobody was hurt nor
was the machine injured, but Billv

'hat he started off afoot, saying that
"Old Chalk," his horse, was good
enough for him no more automobile
Unavoidable Delay
Owing to a breakdown in the mo
tor of the linotype machine, The
Times is unavoidably a few hours
late this week. Such delay caused
us to miss getting the papers out
this morning on the rural routes,
which is the first time such omission
has occurred since the present man
agement has been in charge.
It is only through the kindness of
Harry Denman, editor of The News,
that we arc ajilc to get the paper om
today. He very kindly extended to
us the use of his linotype, for which
we are under obligations. We will
very gladly reciprocate such kindness
if ever our competitor finds himself
in similar difficulty, which we hope
he never will.
A new motor has been ordered,
and should be here by to-morrow,
when it will be immediately installed,
after which our troubles will be dis
sipated in that direction, we believe,
as the new motor should be a good
one. We hope our readers will bear
with us in the delay in getting their
papers to them on time this week,
this being our first such deliquency.
You can also rest assured that tlusc
few hours delay has caused us genu
ine suffering.

A Great Magician
Selvin, the magician, has given
several entertainments at the Mon
arch theatre the past week, playing
to crowded houses at each perform
ance. After his first performance
Saturday evening, hundreds were
turned away from each performance
who were unable to crowd into the.
house. His ability to do things
which are apparently impossible to
the average mind teems unlimited.
All of his work is mystifying in
the extreme, and some of his work is
absolutely bgyond the power of the
average person even to attempt a
solution. One such demonstration
was his escape from a self-locking
casket, which had been borrowed
from the Farmington Undertaking
establishment, which was placed upon
the stage, In full view of the audience,
and was thoroughly inspected by
four well known gentlemen from the
audience. After the magician had
trottcii into the casket anij the cover
had been locked thereon, it was also
securely tied by the four) gentlemen.
A curtain was then drawn in front of
the casket, and within a few moments
was thrown aside by the magician
himself, who was lying upon the
locked and bound casket, apparent
ly intact.
These feats of magic are still the
talk of the twon. When great au
diences arc forced to admit that
"things are that are not," "that it
was, but it can't be," then it is that
people never tire of witnessing those
things that "can't be done," and yet,
apparently are done. Selvin is cer
a'tily the most cb'ver "magician" that
has ever visited Farmington.

WELLS HAS PUT THE "AX"
IN THE POOR MAN'S "TAX"
Notwithstanding the Pernicious Part-
isanship of a Few to Discredit His
Splendid Accomplishments
As an illustration of the unfair
methods that the opposition seems al
ways willing to adopt, in the. hope of
obtaining an unfair advantage of
political opponents, we herewith re
produce a scurrilous squib which ap
peared in the Lead Belt News last
week:
We notice that Assessor
Lawrence Wells advertises that
he put the "ax" in the poor man's
tax. In 1916 the county will lose
in revenue $1,295.75 by reason of
the fact that last eyar Mr. Wells
lopped $50,000 off that part of the
Federal Lead Company's prop
erty known as the old Central, or i
Survey No. 3272. Is the Federal
Lead Company included in Mr.
Well's list of poor men?
Since reading the above paragraph,
the writer has taken it upon himself!
to examine the books in Assessor
Wells' office, and, among other figures
that might prove to be interesting to
those seeking such information, we
have found the following to which the
above squib might have reference:
For the year of 1913 (Mr. Thorn
sen's last assessment) the Butcher &
Bloom survey o. 3272, referred to in
in the Lead Belt News squib, was
assessed for $600,000, on which they
paid tax to the amount of $13,405.00.
For the vear of 1914 (Wells' first
assessment) there was collected in ;
tax on the same tract $15,452.50 j
against $13,405.00 for the previous j
year, which shows a net gain in taxes,
collected for the year of 1914 overl
1913 of $2,047.50.
For the year of 1915 the same tract I
of land referred to was assessed for
$650,000. The amount the County
Clerk extended his tax on and the
Collector collected was $16,832.32 a
net gain in revenue of $1,379.82 over
1914.
The year 1916, the year that the
Lead Belt News referred to. Wells1
lopping off the said $50,000. shows the
valuation of this tract of land to be
$800,000-$150,000 more in valuation
tbrm rtf-jlS, on which the County
Clerk extended the taxes and now is
in the hands of the Collector, show
ing that the county is to collect $21,
149.87 for the year 1916, which is $4,
317.55 more to be collected than in the
year of 1915.
The records absolutely fail to show
where the county is going to lose $1,-
floor oil for Court House, $17; West
End Drug Store, quarantine supplies,
$1.75: I. F. Richardson, guarding
whiskey and beer, $14; J. Clyde Akers,
postage, express, etc., $18.40; J. F.
Richardson, deputy constable, stor
ing ballot boxes and booths, $21;
Hnry Davis, Prosecuting Attorney,
stamps, telephone tolls, etc., $4.71.
INDIANA POLITICS AS SEEN
BY A FARMINGTON BOY
Valparaiso, Ind., Oct. 1, 1916.
Editor Times:
I will give you the political situa
tion of the students of Valparaiso
University and the natives of Indiana
as it appears to me from careful ob
servation, and conversation with
many of the students from all over
the United States.
Hughes spoke here for a few min
utes September 23rd and was heard
by a large audience, but he was not
even treated with the proper respect
that was due a man of his position.
Only a few applauded when he con
cluded his talk, but there was no
cheering neither when he pulled in,
pulled out, or when he finished talk
ing. This is the strongest Republi
can district in the State of Indiana,
but the Democrats think they have a
chance to put a few men over this
time. They have a strong Democratic
club here and have opened up head
quarters in this town and are putting
a lot of "pep" ' and also some money
into the campaign. Wilson will like
ly carry this State by fifty thousand,
I and both Senators and all of the Con
gressmen, with two possible excep
tions, will be Democrats.
The president and vice president of
I the University are both for Wilson,
and the student body is always a
shade Democratic. You sec five Wil
1 son buttons worn to one Hughes but
j ton. Some of the Wilson buttons ara
worn by Wilson Republicans und Wil
ton socialists.
As near as I have been able to
judge from the students here, I would
say that about two-thirds of the Pro
irressives in the East have gone back
to the Republican party, but there are
quite a few of them for Wilson. In
I the West, too, it appears that a ma
! jority of the Progressive vote will be
I with the Democrats in November. I
I have even been told that Cal;firnia
and Wisconsin will go for Wilson,
by men from those States.
I have talked with eleven New York
bovs and they all say that Hughes
I will not carry that State, and four
of them are Republicans.
r. S. vul,)!,, jr.
Mr. and Mrs. O. J. Mavberry lef
Tuesday morning for St. Louis to en-
i y the we; 's festivities thre Thev
went in Mr. Mivhtrrv's Volje -.
tiling with thm Mr. and Mrs. C. T.
240.00; on the other hand they do
show that the county has collected:
In 1914 $2,047.50 more than in 1913.'
In 1915 $1,378.82 more than in 1914.'
In 1916 will collect $4,317.55 mort
than in 1915. ,
The fact is that the county has
gained in revenue $7,744.87 on this
one tract of land alone in the first
three years, instead of losing as statJ
ed.
We also found in the examination
of the Assessor's books, that the to
tal value of assessments in 1913 inf
the Flat River school district was
$1,662,406. In 1916 the records show
that such value had been raised to
$2,264,594, an increase of $602,188.
This little item means a gain in taxes
that will be collected this year, ovel
1913, of $14,322.05. And yet not a
single penny of this increase will come
off of the farm lands in St. Francois
county. Is that not putting the "ax"
in the poor man's tax?
But another item we discovered
during our all too brief examination;
of the Assessor's books was that in.
1913 the amount of school taxes in
Flat River was $20,784.42; this yeai;
the amount of taxes in the same school
district, in which Bro. Cameron rej
sides, is $35,106.47, an increase off
$14,322.05. How much of such in-i
crease did you pay, Bro. Cameron? j
There are many other figures, o
similar importance to those we have,
here given, to be secured from tha.
Assessor's books, but we have neither
time nor room for more just nowf.
The above serves our prosent pur-i
pose, which is to show the length to
which the opposition will go in at
tempts to build up a pyramid of sup
posed facts, in which there is absoi
lutely no manner of truth existing, i
Such miserable misrepresentation
can do the accused person no harm,
so long as there is time remaining to
correct such abuse. But just what
can possess a human being, in a re
spectable business, to thus misrepre
sent a public officer, who has made a
reputation for efficiency and fair
dealing (hj$ sho'i. be the pride of
every honest mas, is a mystery too
deep for The Times to solve.
If the editor of the Lead Belt News
cares anything about the facts, that
are of record, why does he not go to
such records and get such facts?
The natural inference is that it is
not facts that he wants.
An Innovation
In this issue of The Times will be
found an important announcement
from the Klein Grocer Co., headed"
"An Important Change of Interest to
You." It outlines a change in their
present method of delivery, so as to
systematize that important and ar
duous work, in the hope that deliv
eries may be made in a more correct
and satisfactory manner than is pos
sible under the slip-shod method now
in use.
It is the paramount desire of this
enterprising firm to serve its custo
mers in the very best possible man
ner, and with this' end in view, Henry
Mauley, the popular and efficient man
ager of that firm, is always wide
awake and ready to adopt any plan
or system that promises additional
convenience to customers. Commenc
ing next Monday, the firm will put
on four regular daily deliveries of
goods, at the hours stated in the an
nouncement. On Saturdays, owing to
heavier purchases and the anticipat
ed need for such an arrangement, an
additional later delivery leaving the
store at 5:30 p. m., will be made.
It is the hope of this firm, as it
will be of its patrons, that this inner
vation in Farmington will better serve
the buying public, not only in get
ting goods more promptly, but also
in knowing just when to expect de
liveries. While this system is as yet
metropolitan, there is no good rea
son, so the enterprising management
of this firm believes, why the people
of Farmington should not enjoy its
greater convenience.
