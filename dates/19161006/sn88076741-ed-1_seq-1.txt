THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR.
Very little of special importance has
occurred in the European war this week.
There have been no changes on the bat
tle lines that show up on the maps,
The casualty lists of the British forces,
during the activities of the last three
months, show losses of from 3,000 to
1,000 daily. On the supposition that
these losses are about the same as suf
fered by the other armies in the field of
action, and that Russia, France, Ger
many and AustJia have each lost the
sime, and that the smaller nations like
Turkey* Bulgaria, Roumania, etc, at
least together equal those of one of the
larger nations, then to get the aggregate
losses of all the fighting foes we must
multiply the losses of the British by six,
which makes the astounding total of
from 20,000 to 24,000 daily. Of course
this is but a rough estimate but neces
sarily it must be approximate, and goes
to prove that the war must exhauat
sooner or later for want of men if for no
other reason. Our neighbors across the
line are mourning the loss of a very
large number of their sons and brothers
who are named in the long casualty lists
•L
a fXE*
*, it
"c-"- {Ky vi •.*"• sic fttfMS }*, r-
printed dell). Can you realise what it
mean* to be reading over such lists
every day fearing to find the name of a
brother, eon or hnsband?
Zeppeiin raids over England are get*
ting to be almost an every day occur
rence. How much real damage these
monsters of the air are doing is disputed.
Tbe official reports nearly always claim
that the damage is but slight while in
dividuals claim that they are much
larger. Four zeppellns bave been des
troyed lately by British guns:
A- peeuliar thing is that while. the
Germans make persistent attacks on
England that they mostly keep away
from Scotland, ignore Ireland and
though practically just as near attack
London but omit Paris. As yet whether
the Zeppelin or the aeroplane is tbe more
effective as a war machine is not settled,
though along the actual battle lines the
Zeppelin has so far not been used, while
the chief use of tbe smaller craft has
been in scouting in which they have
been very successful.
All things and critics point to tbe con
tinuation of the war through the win
ter, though there is always the possibilty
of something decisive happening at any
time. Taking it as it looks we think
Germany and Austria would be willing
to make peace at tbe present time on
the basis of territory occupied. The
entente allies would be willing to make
peace on the basis of the boundaries at
the beginning of the war. These posi
tions are" of course incompatible and
hardly possible of compromise. But
that all the countries would welcome
peace is very certain, though for military
reasons neither country dares to say so.
Perhaps, one of the most satisfactory
•apparent issues of the war is that as
time goes on we find how little danger
that this country has of being drawn in
to the fight. And further that we never
were in any great danger of such a cat
astrophe. It is quite apparent that
neither of the warring nations wants tbe
United States against it. As a matter
of fact the moral aod commercial weight
of the United States would be sufficient
to decide tbe struggle, without using
our army or navy. The struggle over
there is so equal that the power of the
U. S. if it declared for or against one or
the other, would tip the balances—and
the governments over across tbe water
all appreciate the fact.

FOURTH CHAPTER
In this closing article of this series we
call special attention to the townships of
Joliette and Carlisle. We gave the as
sessment figures in these two townships
to show that the figures for the state,
county and townships are approximate
as to valuation and that the late of taxa
tion varies mostly from local needs and
local assessments and that the state and
county levies vary but little, either per
capita or in percentage.
Thus it will be seen by tbe figures
that Joliette as a whole pays a very
much larger per capita tax than does
Carlisle. These two townships lie along
side each other and are both of the same
area consisting pf two congressional
townships Owing to the fact that there
are more people in Carlisle it is probable
that the land is therefore more valuable
per acre, though both townships have a
very large amount of uncultivated lands
and non-resident farms.
While the fact that so large a part of
the land is held in these townships by
non-resident speculators is a direct dis
advantage in many ways, yet when it
comes to taxation the resident popula
tion has some opportunities of advan
tage. It is as we have said, the resident
population that levies the bulk of the
taxes. It is clear therefore that the
lesidents can well afford to pay heavy
taxes when by tbe same motion they
force the non-resident speculators to pay
equally. This i9 all the more true be
cause the residents have tbe disposal of
the non resident tax money. The non
resident money goes to help pay for
schools and roads where they are need
ed—where the people live. Again,
while the assessor may be perfectly
honest in his valuations, it wonld be re*,
markable if he did not see to it that tbe
non resident land was assessed—proper*
iy.
We would also call attention to the
fact that while Joliette has a very large
railway assessment which pays more
than one-tourth of all taxes in the town
ship yet Carlisle which lies close by and
has a railroad near both the east and
west boundaries gets no railroad money
except its small ibm of what goes to
the county. To us this has always seem
ed wrong. The present system of loesl
taxation of railroads and similar public
utilities is unjust in that while the
whole people support these utilities only
the oities, townships and school districts
through which the railways and tele
phones run get tbe benefit of their as
sessed valuation when it comes to taxa
tion for local purposes. There are some
school districts in this county which get
pretty nearly enough taxes from the
railroads which when added to the state
and county apportionment to pay the
entire salaries of their teachers^ while
right alongside are districts that get
nothing in the way of direct tax from
these utilities.
While the best method of railway
taxation has not yet been found, it is
apparent that this present fashion is
very unequal. In the territorial days
all railways paid on a gross earnings
scheme and the money all went to the
state. The law was later changed to its
present form with the result that now
the state expenses are paid by taxation
of all.property, instead of largely by the
income derived from the railways.
However, there is not much proability
of this law being changed because the
bulk of the legislators are selected from
the cities and towns or interested school
districts, all of which bave railways to
assess.
Personally, we believe the fairer way
would be to pay all railway taxes into
the couuty treasury and then distribute
equally among all civic corporations, or
else let tbe county use it and thus make
the levy for county expenses that much
less, which would give each taxpayer his
proportionate part of the railway reve
nues.
In conclusion, it is not the tax levy
that the taxpayer need bother about so
much as the tax expenditure. If the
taxpayers think they want anew city
hall, a $200,000 court bouse or a $50,000
bridge and vote for such things, -they
vote the tax levy. If Joliette farmers
vote at town meeting to put cement
sidewalks in front of the stores in Joli
ette village out of highway taxes, then
they must expect high road taxes.
Every reader will agree with us that
the amount of money already levied dur
ing the past twenty five years should
have built a well graded road on every
section line in the county—but there are
hundreds of miles either but half done
or not done at all. It will take more
taxation to do them.
The heaviest taxes as we have shown
are paid by the school levies. Some
years ago the legislature abolished the
old-time annual school meeting. Since
that time the financial business of each
district has been run by three men.
Th9 only thing the taxpayers know
about the finances of the district now is
when tbe school boards publish the
annual statements in the newspaper.
There are over one hundred districts in
this county, and from observation and
experience, we think not over one half of
them ever publish that annual state
ment.
We give these examples of the meth
ods by which the taxes are spent locally.
The townships are not much better than
the districts. Very few of the taxpayers
know where the money goes. They may
hear the annual statement read at town
meeting if they happen to be there, but
during tbe year they know but little of
what the supervisors are doing. There
is no published report,
It's not unequal taxation or assessment.
It is not the possible escape of some in
visible property, it is not where the
money runs in, so much as tbe places
where the money runs out where the
taxpayer wants to fix his attention.
The taxpayer will not kick at high taxes
if his money comes back to him in the
form of local expenses for benefits and
improvements,
but
he
kick even
baa a
at a
that money is
right to
low rate of taxation if
wasted
not needed.

WHO ARE BRITISH?
A "British" but not English friend
calls us down becati&e we have been
using the term "English" as applied to
the fighting forces, instead of "British."
He is correct in tbfc, but after all the
word "British" is a littb mixed itself.
Webster says, "British—of or pertaining
to Great Britain." The same authority
&C*fi"* &* z,y****•$ ^wxj&rv
i.
j? -s*
'Ss
*y
\j
W *"2" •»•'*./ J,
says, "Great Britain—largest island of
Europe and includes Scotland, England
and Wales." Thus strictly speaking
only the inhabitants of the island of
Great Britain are British.
In the lager sense, which is included
in the words "British Empire" we get a
considerable mixture of races and nation*
alities, some of whom at least would
object to the term British as applied to
themselves. Take for instance a brown
native of the East Indies, a negro from
Jamaica, a Chinaman from Hong Kong
or an Irishman from Cork.
Over in Canada we suppose they are
British, but we note they more often
say "Canadian" or if they must speak in
Empire terms they hyphenate as "Brit
ish-Americans" but never as' Canadian
British."
However, hereafter, when referring to
the army, when we sa) "British," we
shall include tail! that are fighting under
the "British" (not English) flag.
THE LliCKY NUMBER!
Seven states Will vote upon prohibi
tion Novc mber 7 They are California,
Montana, Michigan, Nebraska, South
Dakota, Idaho, Missouri. Tbe last
named recently secured a dry amend
ment on the state ticket through the
initiative. Thid territory of Alaska will
also vote wet or .dry. In Maryland, the
city of Baltimore, and other wet city and
county units Will vote separately upon
the question.
It is rather perplexing to some of our
readers to find Idaho listed ais one of the
nineteen states! already dry and also as
one of the seven states to vote in Novem
ber. This is the explanation: Idaho is
now under statutory prohibition. At
tbe coming general election she will vote
on a constitutional .prohibition amend
ment.
