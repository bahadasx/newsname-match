A Boon to American Agriculture
Columbus this week entertained tho
farm loan board created by tho rural
credits act and endeavored to con
vince its members that tho capital of
tho state is an ideal site for one of
the banks to bo established by that
law Four or fivo other Ohio cltie3
also presented their claims One of
the dozen loan banks may be estab
lished in tho Buckeye State
The incident brings homo to tho
farmers of Ohio ono of tho benefits
which the Wilson administration has
conferred upon American agriculture
No other president in many years has
accomplished so much for tho averago
American farmer as Woodrow Wilson
has accomplished during his three
years and a half in tho White House
Farming has been the only Import
ant branch of Industry denied the ad
vantages of equitable credit which
modern organization hns conferred up
on manufacturing and commercial un
dertaking Farmers have in this re
spect occupied a position of gravo
disadvantage
This rural credits law enncted upon
tho presidents recommendation la3t
July is thus a measure of long de
layed justice to American j
Ists It puts the farmer upoh an equal
ity with others who possess substan
tial assets and puts the great credit
machinery of the country at his dis
posal t
It is noticeable that Judge Hughes
in his denunciation of the administra
tions accomplishments has little or
nothing to say about the rural credits
act Tho need of such legislation had
been recognized for years but it re
mained for President Wilson and a
friendly congress to put it on tho
statute books
What then Is the rural credits act
toward which the attention of Ohio
farmers has been directed this week
It provides for tho organization of
twelve land banks Farmers desiring
loans for legitimate purposes will or
ganize farm loan associations which
may borrow for their memebers Tho
association will elect officers pass on
tho security of tho land offered mako
appraisals and inspections Each
borrower will subscribe for stock In
the loan bank to the amount of 5 por
cent of his loan This subscription
will not bo paid in cash but added to
his loan and when the -loan is paid
tho stock will be repurchased from
him
Loans will be made for from fivo
to forty years and will bo met by
payments at stated intervals which
will include the interest tho expense
of administration and a percentago
of the principal No interest rato high
er than G per cent may bo charged
The advantage to the farmer in need
of money for developing his acres for
stocking them or for equipping him
self with tools and implements for tho
more economical working of his farm
is manifest Under present conditions
tho farmer Is compelled to borrow
generally on short term notes and
often at exoAltant Interest The cost
of appraisals and necessary commis
sions adds to tho burden nnd the ne
cessity of meeting tho entlro amount
of tho loan at ono time makes the
would be borrower cautious often to
his own injury
Under this legislation the farmer
with genuine assets may get his loan
at a reasonable rate use its proceeds
to develop his land and by easy pay
ments wipe out the Indebtedness with
out feeling It a burden he result
should be a happier family better ed
ucated children a more contented
land proprietorship an advantage by
no means to be conflnod to tho rural
population
It makes Investment In land mort
gages more attractive for by the
terms of ths act the mortgages will
not be taxable they will run for long
er periods and the nature of the ap
praisal of the Underlying secirity
makes for safety All this goes back
to the borrowing land owner as an
advantage This is no mere favor
done agriculture but the conferring
of a right long withheld
The enactment of the rural credits
law is one ot the major achievements
of the Wilson administration No
amount of Idle fault finding no pos
sible volume of platitudinous criticism
on the part of Judge Hughe against
the Wilson administration will de
tract from the merits pi thte act
