1m speculators have captured Boa
ton. The weather is gulden. Hun
dred! of speculators defied the police
and accosted pedostrluns on down
town streets, offering tickets at ex
horbltant prices.
The' ticket scalpers uro brazen. They
placed screaming red placards on the
Copley PUuut hotel where the national
commission has rented the entire
floor and are speculating under the
very nose of Garry Hermann and Ban
Johnson.
Grandstand seats are thirty dollars
fur the three Karnes. They demand
five dollars for two dollar seats.

Through the efforts of the local la
dles' normal school committee and
Superintendent I'ark, a letter writ
ing campaign to mako votes for the
Pendleton normal Is to be carried on
by the 1200 or more school children
of the city.
The plan as arranged last evening
and explained by the superintendent
la for the children to write personal
letters to friends and relatives as part
of their school work. These lettei
will set forth the real necessity of
better normal livtructlon In Oregon
and will appeal for state-wide sup
port for tho measure noon the ballot.
It Is believed that tho appeal from
the children will be effective in mak
ing votes for the bill, particularly so
since the facts show urgent need of
another normal In Oregon and the
educational folk are united in saying
it should be located at Pendloton.
