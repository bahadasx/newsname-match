HIS HOBBYTO AWARD JOBJ
TO 'DESERVING DEMOCRATS'
IIowoll Ernest was removed
from olllce by legislative act bo
cauBu he was unfit to hold tho
position of tin auditor. Whun ho
had boon ousted it was found and
proven that lie could not keep his
own accounts straight, lie made
asoltli'inenlof his accounts upan
demand of the slate. Yet Mc
Donald f jrcod this man into what
II probably the moat important
position in tho slate under pre
sent conditions; that of secretary
of tho state tax commission; a
post whore every interest of Now
Mexico, public and private, de
mands a man of intelligence, of
financial experience and of sound
judgement. It is not Ernest who
Is to blame for the unlmppy
evento which have occurred in the
departments with which lie has
beon connected. It is the fault
of the man who appointed him.
Trinidad C. de Haca was Me
Donald's selection lor state game
warden out of a largo field of
candidates, many of them com
petent men. Since he took olllce
in lí)l! De Haca has spent $'i:i,
f)00 of money paid into his olllce
by the sportsmen of this state.
Ho has put back into fish, game
animals and birds less than
$2500. The sportsmen have not
failed to protest to McDonald.
Thoy have told the (ovornor
what they think of his amo
warden -and thoy have beon
laughed at for their pains and
thereafter ignored. Do Huca is
another "deserving" democrat
Robert II. Crews of Albuquer
que is secretary of tho sheep
sanitary board, tho most im
porUuitofllcial board of this state,
because it has charge of the state's
most important industry. Crows
is n competent lawyer; and he is
a "deserving" democrat; but he
couldn't toll an Angora goat from
Shropshire dam if he met them
in the road. The sheop men have
protested to McDonald against
the grave injury being done the
industry. Hut McDonald, serene
ly Indlil'oront, has told them to
ftjrjjof It -and let his official favor
itos alone.
