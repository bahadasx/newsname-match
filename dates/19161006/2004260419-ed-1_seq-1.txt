BIRD SEASON TO CLOSE
OCTOBER FIFTEENTH!
Deputy Cmne Warden Drown In-1
forum the Mist thr.t the state game
commission decided to close the bird ,
ueason October 15. Tho reason for1,
this ruling In on account of the
scarcity or tho Clilnene phear.ants and
also in tlio hopes Hint uu early clos
lug ol tho hunting season of these .
birds will nuike them more iiumcr-
oua the coming year. Mr. llrown
thinks tlu.t the very severe winter
of Inst ye.ir Is the reason for the
scarcity vt all kinds or birds. K;ir
week snow was on '.he ground and
thousands or gnnio birds r.tr.rved.
Mr. llrown wishes the cooperation
of hunters in enforcing tho order of
tho commission. He states that one
having a pheasant In his possession
after tho 16th would bo considered
guilty of an Infraction or the law
and a severe penalty would probably
bn Inflicted.

SCAPPOOSE
GREENHOUSES
Comparatively few St. Helens peo
ple know that almost In our midst
there is a florist whose gar dons und
greenhouses compare favorably with
any in Portland or vicinity. The es
tablishment referred to Is about half
a mile south of Scappooso, almost
within a stone's throw of tha county
rond, and Is conducted by H. C.
Eschebeck, who settled on his Scap
poose tract five years ago. While Mr.
Eschebeck grows all kinds of potted
plants, ferns and greens, he makes
a specialty of carnations, and ships
thousands of them to Portland flor
ists, so the chances are that when
you ordor carnations from your Port-
land florist you got carnations that
were grown almost at your vory door.

or 12,000 square feet of glass, and

one of Oregon's greatest orators,
Charles W. Fulton, as the principal
speaker of the evening. The state
committee had decided to send Mr.
Fultcn elsewhere in Oregon, but Mr.
Miller made a hurry up trip to Port
land and the result was that the Ful
ton program was changed and St.
Helens was given preference over
some other cities. The fact that Ful
ton is so well known in the county
and numbers his friends by the hun
dreds, will undoubtedly draw many
to hear him.

The speechmaking will be at the
city hall, and In the event of the
hall not being able to accommodate
the crowds, the ex-senator or some
other good speaker will address the
overflow meeting. The committee in
charge especially invites the ladies
to be present. Senator Fulton is
recognized as one or Oregon's fore
most citizens, and he is an eloquent
and forcible speaker. His services
are much in demand nil over Oregon,
and In Tact he was importuned to go
to other states to speak in the Inter

ho chose to give his services to his
own state. The county central com
