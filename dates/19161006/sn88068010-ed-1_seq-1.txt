Commission Twt, Days Inspect-
ing. Highway Mostly Good .
"V-.(.r-,' Bad Bridges f L: v '
Highway Engineer Fred Hayes
and highway commissioner Lon
. Richardson and Milt Bennett
, spent Tuesday and Wednesday
this week inspecting the county
seat highways, going 190 miles
over mostly good roads, but in
spots they were not at all pleas
ed with tte conditions and insist
that improvements be made'
speedily rr a' radical change
would be ordered in routesT
Part of the road between this
city and Brunswick is bad and
could be improved so that it
would , be as good as any other
part of that route if the right
sort of work was done where it
is needed. .
' The best roads in the county
. radiate frpm Sumner, but .. the
commission found the route from
this city to Macon to be first
class except in the neighborhood
of Lagonda where a little work
13 needed to make it splended.
The " commissioners were well
pleased with the condition of the
roads generally, but abhorrent
: of the , bridges and culverts.
Many are as bad as they could
be made and altogether they . do
not match the good roads which
have been made to them.
Basket Ball
Our high school is- developing
somewhat in the art of getting a
; big ball thru a small hole in net-
" ting as to. the boys team and the
4, SitYb team promises to come out
big winners by the close of the
. " season," Prairie Hill put it on us
week before last with its aggre
gation and Dal ton came so near
swiping a game, from us last
week that our boys are shaking
yet The girls went down be
. fore the best team in the state
therefore we do not feel so bad.
We only need a pair of goal
throwers and the replacement of
two light weights when all com
ers with perhaps the .exception
; of Dalton will have to be content
with defeat and even Dalton scalp
will not be safe. Tram work
is what our girls need badly and
they are pulling thru fine now.
Dalton has two of the best xo&l
. throwers in the state as wen as
. , severalothers who play their posi
tions equally as well and with
practice kept up, that girl team
" will be invincible. j

will be fuller than at any other
point and the music numbers as
many as desired by the audience.

Gardner will be distributed to all
who will accept them to read at

situations on the East and West
fronts: but it is certain that
Bulgarians are being successful

about checked in their advance

Build Those Bridges
There is a lot of bridge mater
ial furnished by the county court
last spring which is still lying on
the banks of the sloughs and
branches which they were pro
vided to span. The court has
determined that if all these
bridges are not put up at once in
place of the rickty old death traps
which they were intended to re
place, the material will be turned
over to other neighborhoods
which want it the worst way.
Better get busy and not only put
in the new bridges but make the
approaches good or the court will
get on the trail and come up with
the delinquents.
Jealous And Scrappy Wife
Betty Page, a three hundred

flagrante dilictu, she took for
granted, likewise a club and laid
in wait Saturday night and when
she saw Jenkins wending her
way home, she up and landed on

Number 36
Judge W. M. Williams
One among the most distin
guished jurists of the State died
at his home in Booneville, Mo.,
Sept. 18 and we are safe in say
ing that among the bar of the
state there was not a man who
was held in higher esteem. Not
a Iawer possessed of a limited
knowledge of law but who, if
he applied to J udge Williams, was
favored with the opinion of oae
whose opinions were always good
and in the most gracious manner.
It was this consideration for
mediocrity which made so many
friends for the big hearted man.
Judge William Muir Williams
was born in the town in which
he lived his whole life and where
he died. He married Miss Jesse
Evans of Sedalia, Mo., Dec. 16,
1876, and in addition to his wid
ow, there survives him his dau
ghters, Mrs. J. W. Cosgrove,
Mrs. Monroe Tallifero. Mrs.
Smith Simrall, Misses Jesse and
Sue and son RoyD. Williams,
nis law partner.
The most impressive funeraf
services were conducted at his
home, Rev. Eugene F. Abbott
of St. Louis and Rev. Wm. H.
Black eulogising the distinguish
ed dead. Judge Williams was a
past grand master of masons and
the burial was conducted by his
lodge, the ceremonies being in
charge of P. G. M. Chas. H.
Brigg?.
Judge Williams was one amone
the most active of the citizens of
the county in securing the new
court house and a remarkable
incident occured just as the
corpse was being carried from
the home. A storm had arisen
and just as the casket was being
taken from the house,- a flash of
lightening illuminated the world
and a peal of thunder shook the
earth and the court house was
struck.
Judge Williams wa3 an ex-
judge of the supreme court
besides having held many other
most responsible positions and
sought by distinguished mem
bers of the bar everywhere for
his opinions on intricate ques
tions of law.
Bot a Flivver
County Treasurer Rucker was
never much concerned about
owning an automobile or a Ford
until Miss Rucker made her
appearance at his home a few
days ago. Since that event the
affable officer has been easy, and
the victim of all sorts of npfari
ous schemes but none which
hung him up for the butt of jokes
like his purchase of a Ford Tues
day. Highway Engineer Hayes left
his Ford sitting, or standing, or
both, near the court house.
County Clerk White confided to
County Treasurer Rucker that
he had a first class, little used
Ford for sale and it was dead
cheap at $300. . Rucker inquired
what it had cost White told him
$210. Rucker offered $225, then
$235 and White finally agreed to
sell the car to him for $250.
Rucker lost little time giving his
check to White for the amount .
after consulting his wife and
daughter, will Moore wan tear
the car and $300 was asked. N
Rucker then told Moore he could.'

Recorder of Deeds Hunt and got
Hunt's check for $320. Rucker
was then sorry he had sold and
offered $10 to call the deal off.
White then told Rucker that
sinee he, Rucker, had backed
out he, White, would , do the
same, refusing to accept $250 fer
tile car. Rucker was red hot;
and in a fighting humor when
White disclosed whose car it was,
all bets off and Rucker setting
