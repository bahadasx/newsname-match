Bullet Lodges in Shoulder.
Mrs. Smathers was wounded in the I
le gand shoulder. The bullet that j
| entered her shoulder went through her
body and lodged under the skin. Her
j father's jaw was shattered besides the
i wound in th*> arm that prevented him
fram getting his revolver. The bullet
that killed her uncle struck him in I
1 the head at n range so close that hii
skin WBI scorched.
Rigby cnught seven bullets in vari
1 ous parts of his body, most of them
received, it is believed, while he stood
up to fire at the robbers after the car
had won through the ambush. The
' wounded were brought to the llam
monton Hospital.
County Detectivr Kllis Parker nnd
Prosccutor Jonathrin H. Kelsey, of Bur?

that no detail of their clothing was re-,
memhered.
It was aridanl that the hold-ut' had
beon plaaned earofally by men familiar
with the habits ol' Mr. Rider and ihe
nature af the country. The road is
narrow at that point and runs between

Carnegie Hall Packed for
First Big Repub?

The Democratic Administration's
failures at home and abroad, its scut

the whelaaall slaughter of Ameriean
citizens by (ierman submannes and
Mexican bandits, its surrender to the
lailroad unions and its total inability
to prepare the country against future
dangers wara aaalyaad iast night by
Eiihn Bool ia Caraagia Hall.
It was the lir-t big rally af the Re?
publican party ia Maw Vork City ifl the
present campaign, and hkewise Mr.
Root's first speech on behalf of Charles
E, Hughes. The hall was crowded, ex- '
cept the top gallery, which was almost ,
beyond the range of the speaker's
voice. On the platform sat the leaders
of the Republican party in Greater
Naa Vork.
Mr. Root read his speech from man
aaeript, but this fact did not weaken
the emphasis of his delivery, and every i
now and then h,s outbursts against the
Democratic party's record during the
Iast four years were intcrmpted by
vigorous applause.
Democratic Threa) s Scorned.
The Democratic party, he aaid, had
beoa from its inception national m (

as he recoiinted how Ameriean rigfata
had been trodden under foot by for?
eign nations an.l the thieats af tha j
Democratic AdminiatratioB laughed to _
icom in foreign capitals.
"The iiuestion for the Ameriean peo
plo now." said Mr. Root, "ia whether
they are willing to have senous and
cri'ical atTairs ln which their vital Ifl*
lprest? will be concerned during tne
next four year-, cmducted in the same
way that the Mexican business has
been conducted."
?'No! No'" came shout.s from the
audienee.
Mr. Koot characten/ed the passing
of the Adamson eight-hour hill as a
direet hold-ap af the government be?
fora a queation affaetiBg tne whole
jataerieafl people had been atudied, and
before anybody ia the country rea'.ly
understooa it.
The rally was held under the au<
of the Republican Club, and the
meeting was opened by Charles 0.
Maaa, chairman af the club's campaign
committee, who introduced James R.
Sheffield, president of the club. Mr. :
Sheffield introduced Mr. Root.
Forrner I'nited States Senator
Chauncey Depew followed Mr. Root
with a brief speech, in which he an
nounced that this was his sixtieth an?
niversary upon the platform of the Re
publiean party.
Baay to heep Out of War.
Mr. Root made little of the Demd
cratic Administration's boast that
Wilaon had kept the country out of
war, saying that every President for
icrenty yeara, except Lincoln and Mc
Kinlev, had done as much. He pointed
out that it had never been so easy to
keep the country at peaee. as each ot
tha belligercnt nations was anxious to
plarate America and keep it from
throwing its enormous resources on the
side of the enemy. I
"Our great danger is not now while
the grea' war is ragmg," said Mr.;
Koot, "but later, when peaee has been '
made and great armies are free and

Washington. Ort. 5. Japan is pre
pared to homhard American ports with
fi-rent baseballs. The news reached the
Hureau of Foreign and Domestic Com
merce in a complaint from a Western
baseball manufacturing concern, whieh
states that the Americans taught the
Japanese baseball and now they are
about to undersell American business
concerns.
The letter nays the Japanese have
captured the trade in Canada to a large
extent and have begun to sell the nickel
brand in this country for 30 eenta a
dozen, wholesale, despite a protective
tariff of 40 per cent.
"The danger of the Japanese compe?
tition," the letter reads, "is that through
the leverage of the 6-cent baseball they
eventually will create a market for the
better grade of goods. The baseball in-,
dustry is surely Bfl mduMry fmtered tn

"That is the straight news version of
a riot which, I dare say, might seem a
good deal like the other disturbances
of the strike to a casual observer. It
didn't seem at all the same to me. But
then I waaa't a casual observer. I was
a rioter, eonverted instantaneously
, into one by the magic wand ofapolice

When I walked out of Mozart Hall

was a conservative, lilled with a dis

and volcnce. Five minutes later I was

It was a quick eonversion, but a lot

, had seen women clubbed, for one thing,
and I had been one of the women. It

?vas the argument that counted most

It's disconcerting to realize when
