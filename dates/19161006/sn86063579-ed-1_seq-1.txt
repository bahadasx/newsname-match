then perstions when the shot struck

Tuesday morning. The solemn mili
tary funeral was conducted in camp
Wednesday afternoon. Chaplain Gee
Oce pronouncing it one of tbe saddest
he had ever attended. The funeral
cortege wended its way sadly to the
station, where the salute was fired
nnd taps were sounded. The First

joyed so much in life, preceded the
flng-draped casket, first from the

Wednesday was "beet sugar day"
in Deming and if the farmers get
busy now and sign up 830 to 1CC0
acres for tbe next year it will be the
hafptat day in Luna county.
A number of bankers, business Men
and farmers gathered at the Chamber
of Commerce, Wednesday, and fasten
ed to perfectly indisputable argu
menta eoneeminy the prosperity that
comes with tbe growing of . sugar
beets.
W. B. Ifandeville, banker and eoea
munity builder, opened the oratory
by telling how Colorado started with
almost nothing and now baa few
teen factories and an output of 17,-
000,000 annually.
P. B. Erickson, of the Holly Beet
Sugar Co., supplemented Mr. Mande
ville's arguments with scientific faeta
and told how tbe Arkansas Valley
started with 500 acres and is now
growing 43,600 acres at great pro
fit P. B. Barber, the Hve, progressive
and efaeient county agent of Dona
Ana, told of the benefits that come
to tbe soil from raising beets.
John L. Eornaide, register of tbe
land ofSee, vosehed for all his com
panions and did a lot of good boost
ing. At noon tbe Chamber of Commerce

Erickson, R. A. Lynd, John L. Bnrn
side, R. L. Miller, J. O. Cooper, P. B.
Barber and W. E. Holt
The sentiment of our intelligent
farmers is probably expressed by H.
B. Strickler, who said that the proper
growing of sugar beets had never
failed to bring prosperity to any
region.
We can get exactly the same price
for beets here as at the factory, tbe
company to pay the freight. Tbe
labor question would be no menanee
and an expert would ahow everybody
just how to do the work, the expensee
to be paid by the company. Twelve
tons at 5 per ton tells the story in a
nut shell. Everybody get busy.
