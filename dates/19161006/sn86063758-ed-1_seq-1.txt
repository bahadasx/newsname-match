Columbia, Sept. 30.?The training

a! Guard is receiving on the Mexican
"border is fitting them for duties
which are performed by the regular
army, and' the results which the Palmetto
men are showinw guarantee
that it will be hard to tell them from
regulars when their period of training
in ended.
Those young- men of South Carolina
who went to the Mexican border in
response to the 6a 1 of President Wilson
were inspired by the same patriotic
and high minded purpose that has
characterized this State in all the occasio
(Tit the past when the call to
duty went forth. They are descendants
of the men who helped to put down
tyranny m r<vt>, tougm tue sewuui wiar
of independence againse England in
1812, subdued the red men and the
lawless regimes of the earlier days
<of the republic, conquered Mexico in
\ 1847, and poured out their life blood
on the many -battlefields under the
banner of the Stars and Bars. South
Carolina was the first to respond1 then
*md she was among the first to mobilize
when the President of the United
States sumoned the National Guard to
A
""arms in the closing days of June to
guard the border between this country
and Mexico from bandits and to
be ready for whatever might take
place. ? ?^
On Border Two Months
Excepting Virginia, South Carolina
was the first of the Southern States to
send her National Guard to die border,
and they were ready to go several
weeks before the orders came for
them to move. In fact, the Palmetto
troops were ready as early as those of
New York and the other Northern
"States who were rushed to Texas just
as fast :as they could he gotten ready.
As it was the Palmeto troops have
been an the border for two months and
" n x
it is only in the past rew aays mat
the National Guard from the other
Southern States have begun entraining
for Texas.
This is noi said with any disparagement
to the other States of the South,
y but it's the record, and it is nothing
but due those men v/ho left their
husnriASS in Hill Darts
UVJLU^D auu M&VA* V ^
of the State to call this item of credit
to the attention of the public.
During the seven weeks I was in j
camp at El Paso, Texas, with the
'South Carolina soldiers I had daily
reason to "be proud of my State and
my State's soldier boys. Time and:
again I heard it stated that they came
> to the border better equipped, better
prepared and more efficient in every
way than most of the National Guard
regiments. This was due to sederal
things. They are well officered and
their personnel is high and they hav?
that patriotic devotion to duty that

tend, too, South Carolina, has been
^ fortunate in having as inspectorinstructor
of her National Guard Capt.
J. Malcolm Graham. He knows his
"business and he was all business at
^ Camp Styx, while the boys were being
Bfc equipped and made ready for the bcrder.
He kept things moving and,

tions of other (States, judging from
j what 1 have heard while in camp on

the border, ah or uie iCgUtai ui w,- |

?? hrizades from other;
flCUl auuiuvua. w
States and will be put through sev-1
F days oj field manoeuvers. The
division "will be nnder the command i
Of Gen. Morton. The press dispatches
of tJiis week from El Paso mentioned i
the fact that Palmetto soldiers with J
'iM \
-iie rest of the division would be ta. ven
for a hike to Las Cruces. Xew
.Mexico, which is some seventy miles
irom their camp. They will go fully
equipped just as if they were taking
the field during actuul war and wiil
undergo me traiiiiug wmuu
army experiences in the field during
war times.
South Carolina Third
Of all the National Guard organizations
which were encamped in the
----- - j
El Paso patrol district it was saiu
that 'Massachusetts regiment flanged
first in efficiency, -Michigan second
and* South Carolina third. Both
Massachusetts and Michigan had
been on the border six weeks 'before
the Palmetto boys arrived and it must
also be remembered that those States
appropriate many times the amount
r?f for National Guard
! that South Carolina does. Their
j States are more prosperous and
| have more money to give them for one
j thing. I believe that given the same
j length of training on the border the
; Palmetto boys w,ill rank No. 1 in effi!
cien-cy over all the Mitional Guard orI
ganizations of all the States.

i The soldier boys are all working
hard and doing whatever is given them
without murmuring. Of course,
they think a lot of home and. would
like to be back with their people and
"cussing" like sime I heard, They
do feel as if they ought not be kept

a concentration camp indefinitely.
They respnd to the call of tirms
when it looked as it there was going
to be trouble with Mexico, and they
to-day would go over the Rio Grande
with a shout if orders came from
Washington to invade Mexico. They
have 'been in camp now since the 18th
of June, eithei at 'Styx, or in their
present location, seven miles out of
El Paso, on the Texas plains. Like
all soldiers, the Palmetto boys are
ready to fight, but there is little
prospect of any trouble at present.
About Coming Back.
Since coming back, to Columbia I
have been asked time and again when
thought the fccys would-^fcome fci'Ck
and I have said in about thirty days.
Of course, I have no direct information*
but I believe tat either by November
1 or shortly thereafterwards all of
the South Carolina soldiers will be
returned to Styx and mustered out of
the federal service. It seems to be
a plan to return them home in order in
* * * * J
which they went to tne "Doraer aim
this means that from the El Paso
district the Pennsylvania, Massashusetts
and 'Michigan Xatinal Guard
will be sent fcbck befre the South Car<>"
lina, for they went there beofre tliem.
There are some 14,000 Pennsvlvanians,
~nd prcb-bly 3,000 troops from Mich

time to move soldiers and the equipment
which is carrying the Georgia,
North Carolina iand other troops to the
border will be used for returning
thctee regiments now on duty there
home.
1 T -J ?"?"It- r\ Tinvo
'Anotner reason "?-ny x uuiua
will be home in thirty dlays is that
the field manoeuvers will be over by
the 15th of October and unless they
are sent on patrol duty along the
border they will have nothing to do. I
know too from 'talks with some of
the higher army offici/.ils that they are
expecting the National Guard to be
sent back home.and mustered out of
1 -awriAA in "Vnvpn"ber. 1
L6 leuei cti O^-JL 'ivv 'u
think there is good reason to hope
that the boys can be gotten beck in
time for the fair and efforts are being
j made to this end now by the Chamber
I of Commerce of Columbia. However
! it. will not do to count too much on
{ any partifclar week or day, "but 1
??orfoi'n that t.hev will
cLIII I CdSUliaUi V
be back either on or immediately after
the first of November.
El Paso Folks Cordial
The people of El Paso have been
most cordite 1 to the South Carolina
I soldiers and made their stay on the
j border all the pleasanter by reason
of the attention -vvhiih they lUiTe
shovn the men1 from time .to time.

about the schools and so on. I do
not rec.ill just what I did say, but
I know it was all right and along
the right lines, though I have little
j doubt that some of the modern school
j teachers and profeseors did not agree
j with me. I sometimes believe that
there is more to be gotten out of the
old blue back speller and Smith's
: grammar than any or tne mouern
books. I le.irned by "heart" all those
133 rules in Smitli and even to this
; day when I hear some public speaker
I
: get up and use wrong grammar one or
more of those rules immediately appears
to my mental vision.
Talking about schools I hear that
the county board of education rand the
Newberry school district are taking
into the Newberry district all the territory'
contiguous to it. It reminds
me of what I used to hear the old !
folk say about Mr. Fred H. Donlnick, I
not the congressman, but his grand-;
! father. Every salesdav he would be '
I in Newberry and he always bought
hor>ri Ms unc s hie land owner. 1
can remember that it was said of
him that he wanted to buy all the
land that joined his. If the expansion
idea of Newberry district continues
it will take in all the districts
that adjoin it. I know that it does
not make 'any difference to the peoi
pie what I think about it and to tell
the plain truth it makes no more difforonpp
t(i what the people think
1 iV*V4?W - _
about what I think, than it does to
them. But here it is and they can
read it and' think about it or not
just as they like, but I am going to
say whrt 1 think regardless of what
, any one else thinks. iThstt is e-nppos!
ing of course that aft? of us really
; and truly thinks. And that is the crying
need today of our schools and
our people?none of us think, and
when we do try to think we so often
think wrong, or from our own selfish
motives and purposes and interests.
?o?
But really and trullv I have thought
sometimes, and I still have the hi.ibit,
and scmehow I just can't get rid of
j it. But here goes :
j If the Newberry schools really want
{to be a help in developing education- '
_ _ |
al interests and advancement ot tne
county they can do a great deal that
will help. Not by taking in more ter- I
; ritory and increasing numbers andj
| getting more mioney?and that is the j
real meat in the cocanut?it would
be a whole lot better to develop the I
hig-h school and cooperate v;ith the
schools in the county to bring uj
the common schools so that the chil
dren might come from these country
schools to the high, school at Newberry.
And make it free to all the
children of the county. And develop
it to the very highest point of
efficiency. Then you would i>e doing
something for the education of all
* T17A
the ciiiiGren or uxe tuuuv. out
need to encourage the country school
to develop, and have ias many rural
graded schools as we can get. But
here I am talking about something
that there are lots of people in
the county that know more about than
I do. And who will not take my advice
a hospitable people and in spite of the
j many thousands of soldiers who are
<en'ca:nped in and around El Pasl,
many of the leading citizens of the city
have taken time to make the Palmetto
men feel that they are appreciative
of their presence and realize
fully that they uire there to pro-1
tect and defend them and the other |
Americans who live on the boundary
v
~
between tne two countries. r<*iucularly
has this been true of the First

places. They make you feel at home in

The border is a very interesting
place and in another article I will
undertake to tell something of the
j feelings regarding the Mexican prcb^m,
the daily life of the people and
something about the camp life of the
South Carolina soldiers.

very little whether they take it or

time without number, that
is of very little concern to me, bei
cause I have my reward for pointing '

roads for instance. I

of roads land I am going to give it
to you in this connection d I want j
you to read it and then remember what j
j Ceasar did and then go ahead and do
; likewise. Here it is: -- .& |
WHAT CEASAR BID.
(Ohio- Motorist.)
' MnV a westward ride'
YV UC1I v> V,UkJUl VV
And grabbed the Gauis for Rome,'
,' i
Wilt it was the first thing that he did;
To make them feel at home?
Did he increase the people's loads,
'And liberty forbid
Xo, he dug in and built good roads?'
That's what old Ceasar did.
i i
. "Did Ceasar put the iron heel
Upon the foeman's breast,
j Or did he try to make them feel
* ? ? ? ? "K f O
| Thiivt Rome ruie was uie ucoc;
What did -he do to make them glad !
He came their lands amid?
He built good roads in place of had?
That's what old Ceasar did.
i
"He built good roads from hill to hill.
Good roads from vale to vale;
T./xadq movement
j n.c i ah m; s"vu
! Till old Rome got all the kale,
j He told the folks to buy at home,
i Build roads their ruts to rid,
j Until all roads led to Rome?
That's what old Ceasar did.
t<> -a n-<r town would make itself
" ?J
The center of the map,
Where folks will come and settle
down
And live in plena's lap; /
If any town its own abodes
Of poverty would rid;
Let it go out land 'build good roads?
I J?ust like old Ceasar did."
The Appian Way was built 300 j
years before Christ by Appius Claudius.
one of Rome's greatest gener-1
als, connecting Rome with Capua, ana
later was extended to Brandisi. This
highway is still bearing the burdens
of commerce and the fume of the j
builder, which proves that there is no
monument so enduring as a highway.
?o?
That is good dope. The best investment
that the people can make
hnildine of roads
IS Iliuiicy put in ^
and th,e wonder to me is that with the
great number of automobiles in this
county and the great number of people
interested in the sale of thes?
things that there is not more interest
in the building and maintenance of
t/-. ./-To Rut there isn't. And a lot of
people will not do an/thing, they tell
me, because some one else may get
a little benefit from what he has done.
It is wonderful and remarkable just
how selfish human nature really is.
And thpn v. a are living in a Chr'stian
age. It should teach us, if it teaches
anything, to serve one another and
to help one another. I fear sometimes
we haven't got the right "brand.
The right kind is all right. If more
us had it there wouldn't be so much
need of so many laws and so many
'aw officers.
