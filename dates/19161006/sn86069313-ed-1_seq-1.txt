forecast today when hogs were quot
ed at Herr's Island Stock Yards sev
enty cents. per hundred lower than

of In demand were given by brokers
as tho cause of tho slump.
Any saving which might be effect- j
ed from tljls cause, however, was ,
balanced by the announcement of j
leading hotel managers that ten cents

About forty women who gathered

sistant auditor of the U. S. Treas
ury, spoko in the court house hero
Monday afternoon. The ability of
tho speaker was not known locally
and the audience was not as largo
as It should havo Jieen. County
Court was In session In the lower part
of the court houso and inability to
have the witnesses released for the
occasion also served to decrcaso the
attendance.
Mr. Androws made ridiculous maijy
of the acts and policies of the Dem
ocratic administration and his expla
nation of tho necessity of a protec
tive tariff, especially after tho war,
was made quite plain to his hearers.
Ho proved to bo ono of tho best post
ed men along the lines ot government
finances that ever spoko In Hartford
and his practical way of proving his
points mado friends for himself and
votes for the Republican party. -
During his address tho former Au
ditor touched upon tho Congressional
raco In tho Fourth District and said
that boasts of Congressman Johnson
having saved tho Government great
sums of money was largely political
talk. He stated that no largo Bums
ot money had boon returned to tho
Treasury by Johnson when ho loft
tho Treasury Department In 1915.
Ho charged that Johnson was a det
riment to tho National Capitol and
urgeJ his hearers to veto for Has
woll In November.

0. 0. P. RECEPTION
A HAPPY REUNION
TAFT AND ROOSEVELT MEET"
AND SHAKE HANDS ItEFOUK
HUGHES.
THREE ASSAIL WILSON
Attack Administration Policies Front-
Saino Platform In Now
York City.
New York, Oct. 3. Charles E".
Hughes, Theodore Roosevelt and
William II. Toft spoko tonight from,
tho same platform at a reception giv
en Mr. Hughes by tho Union League
Club of this city.
The occasion served to bring CoL
Roosevelt and Mr. Taft face to face
for the first time In more than a-"
year. They clasped hands for a
moment, each said to the other,
"How do you do?" and bowed. Col,
Roosevelt then passed on to take Ills'
place In the reviewing lino.
Later In the evening Col. Roose
velt and Mr. Taft mot again in the
elovator with Chauncey M. Depew
and George R. Sheldon. Col. Roose
velt, It was reported, Inquired after
the health of Mrs. Taft. They did
not meet again during the evening'.
Trio Assails Wilson.
Messrs. Hughes, Roosevelt and
Taft addressed tho club members and
tholr guests, after the formal recep
Hon In the main room of the club.
In their speeches each assailed the
Administration more vigorously than
before- during tho present campaign.
"We have heard In recent days,"
Mr. Hughes said, "that-tho alterna-'
tlve of the policy of the present Ad
ministration Is war. I think that,
the alternative of the present Ad'
ministration Is peace with honor."
Col. Roosevelt vigorously denounc
ed the Administration's forolgn poli
cy, declaring that thero would be ho
debate In the German Reichstag as
to tho resumption of submarine war'
fare "if they knew that they had as
President of the United States a.
man who would not tolerate any kind
of action of that sort."
Invitation FOr Insult.
President Wilson's speech on Sat
urday, Col. Roosevelt said, left an.
inference that it he were re-elected
tills country would not be drawn into
war, "leaving It to bo Inferred by tho
outside world that nobody could in'
suit htm so that ho w6uld fight." ,
"Mr. Wilson's speech last Satur
day," Col. Roosevelt continues, "was
nn Invitation to foreign Powers to do
whatever they wished because if he
wero in power they need not b
afraid."
Mr. Wilson, Col. Roosevolt said,
"Is praised for tho most part by
people with shoulders that slope- like
a champagne bottle, by people with
timid hearts and quavering voices'
who say that ho has kept us out or
war."
Mr. Taft said that ho concurred In
the view of Mr. Roosevelt that this
election Is tho most "Important"
since tho Civil War, and declared
that ho did not consider that tho Ad
ministration had kept the country
out of war.
No Introduction.
When thoy wero brought face to
face tonight by Mr. Sheldon, there
was no word of Introduction -no
time for It. For a fraction of a
second their eyes metund each look
ed Into the others' unsmiling face.
Then Mr. Taft extended hla hand and
Col Roosevelt took It.
Thero woro other handshakes of .
a formal nature. Among them were
meotings between George W. Per
kins and Mr. Taft and between Col.
Roosevelt and Boles Ponrosu, Sena
tor troin Pennsylvania. As In tho
case ot tho greeting between Taft and
Roosevelt, the commonplaces of moet
tug wero oxchangpd.
Mr. Root, as president of tho club,
stood first In the receiving line, with
Mr. Hughes nt his right. Others lu
tho Hue, In tho order named woro:
Col. Roosevelt, Mr. De'pow, Mr. Taft,
Gon. Horuco Porter, former president
of tho club; Gov. Whitman, of New
York; Sonator Full, of New Mexico;
Gov. Beeckrann, of Rhode Island;
Mr. Wlllcqx, Mr. Culder, Senator
Weeks, Mr. Bacon and W. Cameron
Fortes. The lino of guests was
nearly two hours In' passing and then
