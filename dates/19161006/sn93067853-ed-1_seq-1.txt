JEWISH HOLID
BE 0
'Tom Kipper" Begins Friday ai
Sundown?This is the Most
Sacred of All Jewish
Holidays.
On Friday evening at sundown, the
Jewish holiday of "Yom Kippur," otherwise
known as "The Day of Atonement,1'
is ushered in, and ends at
sundown of Saturday. This is the
most sacred of Jewish holidays, and
with the total abstinence of all food,
and all day prayer of Saturday, is
purely a day of repentance.
In the larger cities, very elaborate
services are held in the temples and
synagogues.
Mr. Emanuel of Baltimore will render
the cantor services here for this
holiday, at the K. of P. hall.
The Day of Atonement, Hebrew
name, Yom Kupper) falls on the tenth
day of the month of Tishri, corresponding
to October 7th of the current
calendar. A special service the evening
before ushers in the solemn occasion,
which service is known as the
"Kol Nidre" (all vows), so called from
the opening words of the introductory
prayer. This introductory prayer is
noteworthy, among other things, for
the profoundly beautiful melody to
which*it is traditionally chanted. A ranged
for modern instrumentation,
the Kol Nidre melody now finds place
011 various symphony programs.
The Day of Atonement itself is the
great White Fast, the culmination of
the penitential days inaugurated by
the Jewish New Year. The Bible, in
several passages, designates it as the
Sabbath of Sabbaths. It. ancient
days its observance was characterized
by elaborate priestly ceremonial and
sacrificial rite, as described in detail
in Leviticus XVI. All this pomp of
ritual disappeared with the downfall
of the Temple of Jerusalem, but the
loss of priesthood and alter did not
affect the vital significance of Yom
Kippur as such, which still remains
the supreme day in the calendar of
the Jew.
Its primary purpose as the name
"Day of Atonement" implies is to effect
an at-one-ment in the ethical and
spiritual life of the individual .and the
and fasting from eventide to eventide
are meant to work on the conscience
the heart and the soul, and brine
them to the mood of genuine contri
non ior me evil of the past and the
yearning desire for amendment in the
future. Coupled with the ' all to "repentance"
is the comforting assurance
that God's tender mercy and
pardon will he vouchsafed to those
who are truly penitent. No mediator
is necessary, no vicarious sacrifice
The only requirement for forgiveness
in the sincere turning from sin and
the coming to God in love and following
His law in loyalty.
One of the most imnressive features
of Yom Kinpur devotion?continued
for the entire day until sunset?is
the memorial service for the
d.ead held usually in the afternoon
The concluding service of the Dav nl
Atonement is called Neilah and the
tone of its praver is holy joy in the
conseiousi ess of God's forgiveness and
loving favor.

. PETITION UNIVERSITY
' PROTESTING BLEASE
(Wednesday's Columbia Record)
Claiming that "it will greatly embarrass
our wives and daughters to
have ex-Governor Blease to speak to
them," several negroes of Columbia
have gotten up a petition protesting
, against the former governor making
an address at the meeting of Allen
university, a negro institution of higher
learning, here tomorrow, asking
I that the invitation to him be recalled.
| The petitioners based their claim of
"embarrassment" on the plea that ex!
Governor Blease "has spoken so
harshly in the courts and on the stump
, against the virtue of negro women
[ and the respect and decency of the
negroes in general and on every occasion
has from, time to time, spoken
against negro education and negro
schools."
The petition, which is addressed to
President R. W. Mance and the faculty
of Allen university, in which attention
was called "to the published
notice in the newspapers that ex-Governor
C. L. Blease will speak at the
opening of Allen university," was
handed to the press by L. A. Hawkins,
a negro, with a request for publication.
The petition follows:
iu i resilient it. w. iNance and racultv
of Allen University, Columbia,
S. C.:
"Dear Sirs: We, the patrons of Allen
university, and members and
friends of A. M. E. church, hep: to call
your attention to the published notice
in the newspapers that ex-Governor
C. L. Blease will speak at the
opening of Allen university on the
4th of October, next. We ask that
you recall this invitation, as it will
greatly embarrass our wives and
daughters to have ex-Governor Blease
speak to them, since he has spoken
. so harshly in the courts and on the
stump against the virtue of negro
women and the respect and decency
of the negroes in general and on every
occasion has from time to time spoken
against negro education and neoro
. schools.
"We pray that you do not force
the unkind predicament upon us now.

titioners will ever pray that the re-.

PASTOR RESIGNS
Union, S. C., Oct. 4, 1S1C.
Edi'or Union Times:
Dear Sir: This is to say that I
have resigned as pastor of the MonAetna
Baptist church to go into effect
Dec. 31, that being the end of
my fourth year's work. During this
time there have been more than 250
additions to the church. Almost 100
of this number by baptism. So far
this year more than 50 have been
added. There has not been a disypntintr
vnto in oil aiiv Kuainooo mnat_
ings. This year the church is in better
condition than it has ever been,
with a membership of more than 250
and a good board of deacons and a
fine Sunday school under the leadership
of Bro. J. A. Petty .make this
a good field for some man. I believe
it is one of the best cotton mill
churches in the State.
I do not know who they have in
view. They appointed a pulpit committee.
of which Bro. G. P. Godshall
is chairman.
I have no place for the future.
Since I came among this good people
I have tried to take my place
among my brethren in doing the
work assigned me. I love all my
preacher brethren and others.
It has been a great pleasure to be
where I could send our children to
the Union schools. Under their good
leaders there are none better in the
State. Everybody of all denominations
have been exceedingly kind to
me and mine, for which I thank God.
Both these mills have nice Christian
gentlemen for bosses. I love them
all.
It will be no trouble for this church
to get a better preacher, but they
will never get one who loves them
more than the present pastor.
I do not lay down the work because
I am dissatisfied, but my love
for my master's cause makes' me feel
that perhaps the church will do better
and be better satisfied with a new
leader. God bless them all.

HAS FIGURED IT ALL OUT.
And Says the European War Will End
in the Year 1918.
(Greenwood Index.)
The Index man, who rambles
around now and then, rambled into
Capt. C. A. C. Waller yesterday, who
told him that if he had timo Ho ?mni.i
write out for this good family newspaper
proof from the Book of Revelation
that the great war wjil emi jn
JanUary, 1918. He said that some fellow
asked him if he could handle the
"ittathematics of the concern," and
that he told him he could, and had it.
And he has it logically figured out'
that it is interesting even if the prediction
fails.
In a hurried conversation along the
atreet it is impossible to take notes.
Mental notes are not always safe.
But the newspaper man brought away
the fact that Capt. Waller bases his
calculations on the fifth and eighteenth
chapter of the Book of Reve^^00?it
is mighty hard not to stick
l on this, as most folks will
Bpl nljt In doing.
TfTha, Ipdex Bible gives these verses
\ **,And there was given unto him a
mouth speaking great things and
' )a?phemiea; and power was given
cpntinue forty-two
Whi* the first verse.
5F|P%. Waller says this refers to the
vVser, and he will run his race in
Yorty-two months. This will mean the
end of him and his power by January
,1918. Now, there are six letters
in the word kaiser, and Capt.
Waller says put the figure six down
on one side and then consider that the
letter "k", the first letter of kaiser,
is the eleventh letter of the alphabet.
Put this down and multiply this
eleven by six and you get six hundred
and sixty-six. Then read the 18th
verse of this same chapter of the
Book of Revelation. It reads: "Here
is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the
beast; for it is the number of a man;
and his number is six hundred three
score .and six." And if you don't believe
it, look it up yourself.
Capt. Waller says he has figured it
out half a dozen ways, and has promised
to write these out for The Index;
and that he wiy prove it beyond a
shadow of a doubt.

I White Man, for Congress a
[ Number of Years Ago.
e
f Columbia, Oct. 4.?Despite the protests
of a number of well-known ner
groes, some alumni of Allen Univer.
sity, Cole L. Blease, former governor
1 of South Carolina, was the principal
speaker at the opening of that institution
here today. He was introduced
and highly lauded by the Rev. W. D.
Chappelle, I). D., Bishop of the A.
2 M. E. Church, who declared that Mr.
s Blease was foremost among all the
t governors of the State. In asking by
- petition that the invitation to Mr.
. Blease be withdrawn, the protestants
- declared, "It will greatly embarrass
. our wives and daughters to have ex,
Governor Blease speak to them since
t he has spoken so harshly in the courts
and on the stump againt the virtues
f of the negro women, and the respect
j and decency of the negroes in gcn.
eral." This petition was ignored, and
f the Bishop today was somewhat seath.
ing in his rebuke of those alumni
and former students of Allen who had
presumed to dictate the policies of a
great church.
~ *i- 1 - - -
niiu are uiey .anynowY" the high
r churchman asked. In answer to his
i own query, he said: "They are not
. known beyond their own back yards."
, In the course of his remarks, Mr.
Blease boasted that it was he who
cast the deciding vote when George
Murray, a negro of Sumter county,
was made congressman instead of
- Moise, a white man also of Sumter.
- a number of years ago. "If I had had
t as honest a canvassing board three
weeks ago as passed on the election
? of Murry, I'd be the next governor
of South Carolina. I've learned that
the white people have not only learned
to steal from the negroes, but that
they have learned to steal from thein1
selves," he declared.
- The speaker explained that he had
1 often been misunderstood by the nef
groes. He charged that the negroes
' were chisseled out of a portion of the
- taxes which they pay, when it comes
' to making apportionment between
white and negro schools. He urgeS *
the young negroes to aim high, to be
truthful 'and ^ho^'st, reininding^that
prolonged words of praise and held up V
Mr. Blease and the Bishop as worthy
examples to be emulated by the students
of the school. Each, he said,
was known throughout the United
States.
LETTER FROM OAKLAND.
Oakland, Oct. 3.?This season of
the year calls for as much work oi.
1 the farm as does early spring when
f the plow must needs be started, if
' anything the work should be extended
' more rapidly now because the gathering
of a crop ought not be neglected.
Not a little attention is being applied
to the making of hay for the oa?'
few days. This can be evidenced hv
, viewing the large hay stacks about
- the barn yards which indicate that
a there is not enough house room to
i store the roughness in. The pea crop
e is shorter this year than for man
years past. The Unknown pea has
- certainly acquired the name to which
the variety was christened when discovered
for it is a complete failure
' this year.
Cotton is selling for 16 V. crr.ts per
- pound today, a very good living price
- to be sure if a fellow had some to
f sell but rather small comparing 6 to
- 10 bales to the plow last year vith
el 2 and 3 bales this year or in ether
o words $162.50 for two bales this year
- against $375.00 for six bales last vear,
ri a difference of $112.50, enough to
finance the expenditures of a small
family during crop time. It would
have to be around 30 cents or the
rise to make the purses equivalent
- to each other.
Oakland school opened its doors on
