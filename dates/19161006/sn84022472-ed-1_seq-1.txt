Investigation of Controver
sy Likely to Bring Full

New York, Oct. 6 A , difference
only as to the length of the contracts
to be given by the New York distri
butors to the farmers existed today
when the state opened its investigation
of the deadlock which has kept this
city on a- short supply of milk for
several , days. v .- "
One of the big distributors had of
fered to pay the farmers the increase
of one cent a Quart which they de
manded, but had refused to make this
contact Tor six months as the Dairy
men'is League insisted.- Other leading
distributors had ' not agreed ' to this
concession but some of the smaller
dealers -had complied with! the de
mands of the leagife.
The first thing done at the state in
quiry today was to place on record the
complaints filed With the attorney gen
eral toy each side In the controversy
charging violation of the state anti
trust act One complaint by John: J,
KDnion commissioner of food and mar
kets; named seven or eight distribut
ing concerns as constituting a mon
opoly in. the control of the pasteuriza
tion plants and asked if the law could
not be amended so that these plants
would.be taken over, "for the public
food."
Charges filed by the distributing
companies alleged that the Dairyman's
league was an , illegal organization
formed undfr the laws of New Jersey
and not authorized to, dos business in
New York. ' , ,,
- The continuance of the deadlock
today resulted in a still taore serious
situation in respect to the milk supply.
Morning deliveries were f urther di
minished, and many thousands were
unable to procure milk at all.
' 'To prevent a recurrence of yester
day's scenes, on the upper east side
when hundreds of women stormed

were on duty in, the neighborhood to

of the present situation!
The conferences thus far, notwith
standing considerable good will on
both sides, have not brought the op
posing element much nearer together.
They have shown the chancellor to be
in full accord with Field Marshal Von
Hindenburg, chief of staff, and with
the navy department. Both the mili

New "Haven Engineer Says
He Can Prove Hall St'a
, ; Private Crossing; -
The-city of Bridgeport may start
negotiations with the railroad com
pany for public: crossing at Hall
street as a-result of disclosures made
before Coroner John - J. . Phelan this
morning which thowed that legally
there is no crossing at this pointy City
Engineer Frank Black, who-' was , a
witness at the hearing, said the city
had no record to prove that there bad
been . a public crossing at Hall
street.
Richard L. Rlch, an engineer In the
real estate department of the New
Haven Railroad Co., was on hand to
state the case for the Railroad. - Me
said the Housatonic Railroad Co. se
cured a right of way over this route
In 1839 and 'bought property on both
sid- oft the track.! In 1873 the city
caused a layout of Housatonic avenue
to toe made and a thoroughfare 60 feet
wide was made on each side of the
tracks. It was not on til 1877 that
Hall street was laid out. '
The, street first ran from North
Washington to Housatonic avenues
and a few years latet- an extension
was made from Housatonic avenue to
the Pequonnock rtver. As a result
of a law passed about 1875 the city
could not run a ' street across the
railroad tracks without procuring the
consent of the company. - , Engineer
Rich said there Is no record that the
city ever asked for such consent. He
said the company has allowed per
sons to cross jthe tracks at this point
as a matter of convenience but such
persons have done so at' their . own
risk. The witness promised to send
documents to further 'prove the com
pany's contention. ..
- Coroner Phelan will not make a
finding on the death Of Edward L.
Green? killed In the Berkshire division
wreck, until he gets these documents.
