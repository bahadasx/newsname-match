sult the regular meeting was post
poned until Thursday evening.
PULLMAN. WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6. IfM
Ask Reductions in tally Budget
Taxpayers' Association Granted Two
Weeks to Prepare Brief of Griev
ances Before Pinal Hearing
on Estimates
—————
The Whitman County Taxpayers'
I Association and the board of county
I commissioners are at war. A foren
sic .lash between the two organiza
tions marked the meeting of the
commissioners this week, when rep
| resentatives from the Taxpayers' as
\ sociation appeared before the county
| fathers in an effort to effect a reduc
tion in many of tne items included
in the estimate of expenses prepared
by the commissioners. About the
j only point gained by the taxpayers
I was the granting of a two weeks re
prieve in the hearing on the budget,
| during which time a brief of the as
sociation's recommendations will be
: prepared and submitted for consider
ation. The commissioners showed
! little inclination to grant the re
j quests of the petitioners for a reduc
tion in the county's operating ex
| penses and the result of the meeting
of October 16, when the budget will
|be adopted, either in its present
I form or revised, is awaited with .in-'
■ usual interest.
Anent the' clash between the two
I organizations the Palouser of last
.Wednesday said, in part:
i President F. J. Wilmer of the as
sociation, acted as spokesman for the
delegation of taxpayers, occasional
ly calling on E. A. Thompson, the
secretary, for additional information.
Besides Mr. Wilmer and Mr. Thomp
son there were present D. F. Staley,
j Pullman; R. F. Rigelow, Colfax; R.
C. McCroskey. Garfield; and .1. M.
jßeld, Pullman, who are members of
c the finance committee of the asso
ciation.
"We are not criticising nor muck-
I raking," stated Mr. Wilmer to the
| board. "We want the most for our
money, and that alone prompts us
I to come here."
lie took up the estimate for the
1 auditor's office and implied in his
I comments that there was no need for
; the extra clerk asked for to care for
the liquor permits and auto licenses.
In discussing the treasurer's esti-
I mate Mr. Wilmer called the atten
-1 tion of the board to the increase of
$1000 for salaries. M. W. Whitlow.
! chairman of the board, replied,
I "This extra help was recommended
by the state bureau of inspection of
; public offices. We didn't think it
| necessary."
i "Yet you granted the extra help?"
asked Mr. Wilmer. He recommend
!ed that the treasurer's force be cut
jto five persons, which he said was
'sufficient to handle the work.
Consider* Assessor's Estimate
j In considering the assessor's esti
-1 mate Mr. Wilmer said, "There is an
! increase of $500 for salaries for field
I deputies, despite the fact that real
j property will not have to be assessed
'again as it was this year. Greater
diligence on the part of the field as
essors would bring about a saving.
Garfield Boy Heads County Clubs
—~—
'Otho Love Named President Roys'
| and Girls' —Blanche Henry
Is State Vice President
—————
Otho Love of Garfield, one of the
' principal prize winners at the recent
\ county exhibit of boys' and girls'
! club work held here, has been named
i county president of the Whitman
' county branch of the national or
ganization for the coming year.
I Blanche Henry of Johnson, a mem
ber of the winning canning team at
1 the local exhibit, was honored with
the vice presidency of the state or
ganization. Both of the honored
members represented their county at
the state fair at North Yakima, the
former in the stock judging contests
; and Miss Henry as a member of the
i Whitman county canning team.
! Both are enthusiastic club members.
County presidents of the National
Boys' and Girls' clubs, with head
quarters at the State College, were
announced by State Leader T. J.
Newblll as follows:
Clallam county, Clark Chambers
Much property Is escaping taxation.
1 have some wheat and one or two
warehouses that have not been taxed.
The auditor's records will show that
many more automobiles have been
licensed than have been assessed in |
the personal property."
Should Purchase Ford
"The superintendent's estimate'
shows a slight increase for traveling I
expenses. That brings us to another I
point It seems that if the county |
would purchase one or two light an-1
tomobiles a considerable saving
could be made-.''
"Not one single, solitary cent," in
terrupted Commissioner B. T. Man
chester.
"I admit that If you buy a Pierce-
Arrow car you probably wouldn't
save much, but the purchase of a
light car, a Ford, which certainly can
be operated for less than five cents
a mile, you can save a good deal by
escaping the 15 cents a mile that you
are paying now."
"Often," replied Mr. Manchester,
"six or seven of us have to go out
together, and I think too much of
myself to crawl into a Ford with five'
or six others."
"Then rent a big car in those
cases, but use a light car for the
great body of the work. The sheriff's;
force often rents a car at 15 cents
a mile to go to Pullman or some
other place, paying $6 for the use
of the car when the trip could be j
made by train for $1.
"We suggest one light car for the \
sheriff and one for the engineer. ;
There is another point. The travel- !
ing expenses for the sheriff's office
are much greater than in other coun
ties. The sheriff and his deputies
buy straight transportation for three i
cents a mile. They can buy mileage !
books at a lower rate and bring
about a considerable saving."
Commissioner .Manchester agreed
with him. •
"Then, too, it seems that the
sheriff's force travels too much. '
They take long trips at big expense :
to bring back a prisoner that is not j
worth the expense.' These men who
are arrested at distant points for
petty crimes should not be brought |
back. The county is better off with
out them." i
Members of the board agreed with
him. "The sheriffs have been over- i
zealous," stated Commissioner Whit- ;
low. '
Mr. Wilmer called attention to the
request of the prosecuting attorney
for a deputy, and declared that
since the dry law had cut down the I
amount of crime there was no need j
for it. "That may be," stated Mr. I
Manchester, "but I remember one!
case in which the county paid $3000 j
for associate counsel."
Should Appoint Engineer
Mr. Wilmer recommended that the j
engineer's expenses be charged
against the engineer's office, and not i
against the road and bridge fund, de
claring that the engineering charges
on that fund were very high.
"I want to make another state

WILL PROVIDE PLACE
FOR HIGH SCHOOL ROYS
The recent and wise ait lon of the |
Pullman school board in forbidding
the maintenance or organisation of
secret clubs or other organisations
of high school students except under
the sanction of high school authori
ties having placed three such organ
izations under the ban. a movement
has been started by the Ministers'
Alliance toward providing a suitable
place for the high school boys to
spend their Idle time to profit. The 1
Rev. Caughlan. representing the Al
liance, appeared before the chamber
of commerce Tuesday with a request
for co-operation, and the matter was
made a special order of business for
next Tuesday, when definite plans
will be promulgated. The final re
port of receipts and expenses in con
nection with the recent county ex
hibit of boys' and girls' club work
will also be made at the Tuesday I
meeting and a full attendance Is de
sired.
W. O. W. TO SMOKE
At at well attended meeting of j
the W. O. W. Wednesday evening a |
committee was appointed to make
arrangements for a big smoker in
connection with the next meeting.

COLLEGE LIVESTOCK j
CLASS OF NORTHWEST
i
i
Twenty Head of Thoroughbred Cattle
and Sheep Win $700 Cash, Over
Eighty Ribbons and Cup
Live stock from the college farm
proved its right to be classed as the
best in the Northwest during the
tour of the three principal Northwest
fairs just completed by Richard I
Hanna, herdsman. Fifteen head of
cattle and five head of sheep were ex
hibited at the Spokane Interstate'
fair, the Washington State fair tit
North Yakima and the Oregon State
fair at Salem, and $700 in premium
money, over 80 ribbons and the best
cup ever secured by the college was
brought back by Mr. Hanna upon his
return Wednesday. "Roan King" a
two-year-old Bhortborl horn steer
took first prize in the fat animal
class at each of the three fairs as well
as winning the grand championship
at the Oregon State fair, and made' 1
possible for the college an elegant j
silver loving cup, standing nearly j
two feet high. Other grand cham
pionships won at the Oregon fair
were on fat sheep and the Hampshire
ewe. Two Galloway cattle, a cow I
and a bull, also proved the best in
their class at each of the three fairs,
although the Hereford cow "Rare
Maid," proved the best money maker.
Much of the credit for the excel
llent condition of the college stock.
a Source of invaluable advertising for
the institution, must go to Mr. Han
na, the herdsman, who had the stock
in Charge during the entire trip.
i
FARMER** ARE PROSPEROUS
! An index to the prosperity of the j
j farmers of this neighborhood was {
! observed in the abundant supply of,
cash in evidence at the public sale by,
the Farmers and Mechanics bank at
'. the old Burgan farm last Tuesday.
I According to J. N. Scott, who served
'as clerk, the total sales aggregated
$2700 and only three buyers gave
notes in payment, all of these In
small amounts, practically all of the
farmers paying in cash. Another in
dex to the unprecedented prosperity
of the farmers was the fact that,
every buyer, and many of them were
accompanied by their eintire fam-
Hies, went to the scene of th* sale In ,
an automobile. N. W. Cairns was i
auctioneer and the sale was a big
success.
MOORE SELLS DAIRY
L. E. Moore has sold his interest
In the Pullman Dairy Co. to H. H.
Curtis and C. H. Barclay. Prof.
A. B. Nysctrom and Roy M. Phillips!
have each bought a quarter Interest j
In the company. Mr. Moore will I
probably leave Pullman and go Into'
the live stock business. He desires
to thank his former patrons for their
support.
NUMBER 50
PULLMAN HIGH VS.
I TEKOA SATURDAY
First Game of Season tor Local High
Schoolers Scheduled for Tekoa
Tomorrow Fourteen Men to
Make Trip
Fourteen football men from the
Pullman high school will Journsy to
Tekoa tomorrow to meet Tekoa high
in the first game of the season.
While several old stars are lost to
the team through graduation, Coich
i Savage lias whipped into shape a for
midable lineup that should give a
good account of Itself against Tekoa.
| The team .selected by Coach Savage
j Includes Burgees at fullback, Captain
i Mclver and Randall at the halfback
I positions, and Walters at quarter.
j Meeks will play the pivotal position,
Crow and Carson guards, George and
; Morse tackles, and Kampen and
! Nash ends. Three substitute! will be
i selected from the following candi
dates: VanVoris, Douglass, Dressier,
i Lowell, Stine and Emerson.
Student Body Meets
; In a special student body meeting
| culled by President Kampen, it was
i decided to publish an annual and
j charge $3 per copy and let this in
dud.' all the incidentals. This ar
i rangement eliminates the cost of
having the individual pictures takon,
the space dues, and the half-tone
dues, thus reducing the cost of the
j annual over 50 per cent. Another
i important matter was decided when
I a motion was passed providing that
i In order to be an official wearer of
I the "P" the individual must play
three full games or half of all the
games in football and basket ball.
Masquerade Postponed
The masquerade party to have
been given in the high school gym
nasium Saturday, October 1, was
postponed until October 14 because
of the Tekoa game, which will take a
number of the boys out of town.
Girls Will Play
Basket ball for th.' girls of Pull
man high school is promised for this
year. The girls will play nightly
after school in the high school gym
nasium Miss Davis and Miss Arm
strong will supervise and instruct the
girls.

WILD TURKEY
FATHER OF BROOD
Fifty Half-Wild Turkeys Being
Raised by Poultry Department
for KxjM'riinenlal Purposes
__
An experiment undertaken by the
I poultry department of the State Col
j lege for the purpose of promoting the
1 meat phase of the turkey Industry
| shows now, as net results, a flock of
j 50 half-wild turkeys which frequent
ly are seen flying in flocks high over
the tallest clumps of trees on the
State College campus or farm. The
I half-wild youngsters have as their
sire a wild torn purchased from the
[Thurstton county game farm. They
show in their feathers the predomin
ance of brown and lack of clear-cut
I lines between black and white which
'is characteristic of the native wild
1 American turkey.
Mrs. H. D. WhiUker, head of the
! poultry division, states in the opin
ion of many turkey raisers, the In-
I fusion of wild blood Into the domesti
cated strains of turkeys results the
first year vo an increase In vigor, and
lin the second generation, In an In
' crease in size of the turkeys. Tho
half-wild youngsters now are con
suming about a quart of wheat fed
;at night to 50, the balance of their
diet being mainly grasshoppers and
other insects which they find in their
daily wanderings about the campus
•COMPILED COMPLETE DATA
J. M. Reid, at the request of the
chamber of commerce, Is compiling
complete data concerning Whitman
county and other counties tributary
to the Snake river for the benefit of
government engineers who are in
vestigating the possibility and feasi
bility of power development on the
Snake. The engineers will make a
second trip of inspection up the
Snake soon and data will be placed
In their hands before that time.
