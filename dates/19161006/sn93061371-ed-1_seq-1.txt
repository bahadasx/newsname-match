The nevvspipeis throughout
the country announced immed
iately after the adjournment of
of the recent session of 0 -ngress
that a law had been enacted al
lowing homestead entries for
G10 acres of grazing land.

to provide for stock-raising
boniest kuU and for other pur
poses," but with vari'dtls amend
ments. The house of tiepi essn

"I would not bo going if it visn't
for Nora," Patsy said with a toss of
her head. She stood before the bu
reau In the little front bedroom of the
flat, pinning a band of black velvet
around her hnlr as a final touch of
artistry.
And the family admired and mar
eled likewise. Not a single St. Pat
rick' day dance had Patsy gone to
In three years. Some said it was on

Open Letter to Hughes
Dear Mi. Hughes:
You'll please excuse
My dullness if I seem obtruse.
Or fail to properly enthuse,
Y bun you break loose.
The papeisgive me all the news
And more advice than I can use;
But when I try ti.getyour views
On public Questions, then I lose
My patience, and 1 sigli and say
"Oh, what's th'3 use!"
I give the devil all h's dues:
I rather liked you, Mr. Hughes,
When you were judge. But
when you cl oose
To be a knocker and abuse
Our fVesident, I must refuse
To read your ''ooe."
The Democrats you still accuse;
Yotir lamentations I peruse.
1'heso may alarm they can't
aniuso,
And thinking men tlisy won't
confuse;
But altogether, Brother Hughes,
You're too profuse.
One final word before adieus:
If you would stand in Wilson's
slioeH
You'll have to try some other
rtiHe-'
For, by the goil, you're going
to lose!
The Republican paity will get
its dues;
You're up against it, Mi .
Hughes.

circulation has the figure of a

gate. No one lias, as yet, been

Don't fail to be at the City

Clubb.
teen he shipped on " coast steamer,
and plfd tifi'aiTd down ai S cabin
bp..f-;v:-.;A; .
"Go rou-'wifti'yoti, Terry," she tolJ
him. "I'll not b having you jaunt
this way and that it you've a mind to
keep along steady with ton, You caw
an your own way." ,
"AnfL.' TA I not be marrying a girl
fihat .wotildij't bo proud of my seefng
f? Drorld,': said Terry Taliantly.
But fWay had felt hart and alck at
heart. She was twe'nfy' novr; and ber
neighborhood wondte4 ' why Terry
and she didn't marry and aettle down.
So there had come a St. Patrick'
day, and he was to have taken her to
dance that evening. During tb
whole day she had waited for him tcr
show up. Then, when evening came
and It was too late, she had laughed
and gone to the dance with big Danny
Sullivan.
Patsy never forgot Terry" face
when he came into the hall and ftw
het in Danny's arms, fox-trotting. Tli
next day he enlisted for three years'
in the array, and went away without
a word to her, his best girl for five
years.
She had heard of him from his sis
ter. He was sent to the Philippines.
Sometimes Molly told her they had re
ceived a box of things from him.
He never sent anything to her.
Once, at a Hallowe'en party, h
bad found a silver ring in his slice of
eilk'6, and had slipped It on her fin
ger behind th hall door as they were
all going home. Patsy got it oat and
put it on.
Hut tonight It really was tor Nora'st
sak6 that she was going up to the
dance. Nora was only seventeen and
wanted (o go, and she wouldn't b
letting a girl like that trip ofT&lone,
and who was the man fit to escort
Nora? 1
They were a little late, but stfll hi
time for the grand march. Someoua
OH the reeeption committee caught
Ncra a'ay to introduce her, and Patsy
found herself Bai4ed over to a swiftly-procured
partner.
"Bora you are, Terry, my fcoy," said
genial old Ponovan, the floor chair
man. "Take your places now quick
over there."
The hand that Terry took waa cold.
It seemed a year before the march was
Aver and he-had her by herself.
"Arid won't you say a word to me.
Patsy?" ha ah). "Aren't you glad
to see me?"
"If I'd been waiting with a welcome
for you all this time, it might bare
grown 8 bit cold by now," said Fatsy,
with the old toes of her head and flasb
of her eyes at him. "Did you like the
climate, Mr. O'More?"
Terry groaned in spirit, and a bit
audibly, too. He leaned one band on
(he wall Just above her, and put the
Other on his hip.
"I've thought of you and dreamed
of you every day for three years," he
Haid, fervently. "And you haven't
changed a bit, Patsy. My heart
dropped In my boots and flew up to the
stars when I saw you come into the
hall." i
"It's quite lively, Isn't it?" laughed
Patsy. "Have you brought It back In
pieces?"
"You should be knowing. Patsy. I
left it with you. Didn't you break It
yourself dancing with that wall-eyed
Dan Sullivan right under my nose In
this very hall? Didn't he tell me him
self he'd marry you In a month, and
he knew you'd have him? Didn't you
tell him I was a rolling stone?"
Patsy's eyes twinkled at the mem
ory. "I did," she said happily, "and more
of it. nut he never married me in a
month, or a year, either. Don't you
think Nora's a beauty?"
"I'm not looking her way Just now."
said Terry. "I've served my time, and
am in the reserves now, and I'm going
to settle down. I've had enough see
ing things. You'll find me changed.
Patsy. I'm a quiet family man now.
Sure I'll go back to the colors any
time they need me, and you may be
drawing a widow's pension on my
bones yet, Patsy darling, If you say
the word."
Patsy looked down at her hands,
and she turned the little ring around
her finger. Couples were going back
to the hull to the next dance, but they
two lingered.
"Patsy, treasure, can't you say
something kind to your boy?" Terry
urged.
"Oh, go along with you, Terry," she
laughed. "Can't you see I'm wearing
your ring?"
