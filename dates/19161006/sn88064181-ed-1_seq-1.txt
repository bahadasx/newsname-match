h(I one of the richest oil fields in bhe till

There were interesting legal points tra
involved. When the ('addo Levee cit
Board was formed this, with other me
lands, was turned over to it by the ve
state, and later oil was struck in large an
quantities at various parts of the lake. by
It is said the levee board is now get
ting a royalty of $250,000 a year from in(
the output, its share being one-eighth j3o
of the yield. It was after the value
of the land became apparent that
the United States laid claim to CO:
It, not because it discovered there col
was something valuable to be obtain- As
ed, but because its attention was call- nu
ed to the mater in the ordinary dul
course of business. StJ
Oil having been struck, several per- fixi
sons desired to get a lease on the tee
property, and holding it was mineral Va
land, and hence the property of the on
federal government, they applied to ed
the Interior Department. That de
partment looked into the matter and J
laid claim to the land, holding that tin,
it waar..mert $a whica , d , .wj
b1- ubi, oveiflowed by thered riirWEr raft, vUii
ald had not been transferred to the der
state. The attorney general's office St
investigated old maps and found the car
lake was there when Louisiana was tie
made a state in 1812, and maintained riv
there was no necessity of going be- din
yond that date. But the federal gov- tw(
ernment sent ecologists to the scene, sor
who declared the land had been a val
ley, but the formation of the raft in '
Red river backed up the water and Ba
submerged the valley about 1770 or siv
1780. set
Mr. Gamble, for the attorney gen- the
eral's office, promptly adopted this wh
statement of facts as his own, and ru
argued his case along that line. F1- Th
nally the Interior Department put the es
matter up to the United States attor- ex
ney general, who has held that the in
title of the land is vested in the state.
STATE HAFFENINGS. m4
In addition to attording protection 5
to the beneficiaries of its policy hold- pr
era, the Lousiana State Life Instr- n
ance Company has arranged to give
its clientele protection against iv
phoid by affording them the same e
treatment Uncle Sam affords his sol
diers. The company, according to
Dr. T. P. Lloyd, its medical director,
will vaccinate all of its policy hold- e
ers against typhod free of charge th
upon application. For these policy ty
holders living elsewhere than in ae
Shreveport, Dr. Lloyd' said that a t
supply of anti-typhoid serum or vac- al
cine whl be sent to the physician 8
designated by the policy holder in his
request for this added protection.

London.-British losses in Septem- a
F ber were at the rate of more than 3,
800 a day. The casualties on all
' fronts reported in this month were:
d Officers 5,439, men 114,110.
Heavy as were the British losses in
September, they were lighter than
those of August, which were 127,945, ti
o a daily average of 4,127. In July, the b
first month of the Somme offensive,
the losses were about half those of
August or September, notwithstand
ing the fact that in July the British i1
stormed the first line German de
e fenses. The casualties in that month
o were 59,675, so that the total for the
three months of the Somme drive is
307,169.
French and English press dispatches n
d report that, considering the charac
ter of the fighting, the losses of the
allies on the Somme are low. German

Washington.-Responsibility for any ii
statement that after the European
war Japan would renew negotiations s
with the United States over immigra- v
tion and alien land legislation was t
disclaimed in a statement issued by c
the charge, Tokichi Tanaka. It was a
explained that an ofcial of the em- t
bassy who expressed views on the I
subiect yesterday spoke personally 1
ia withOUt any authoriuatIon.
Furthermore, Mr. Tanaka declared
that Baron Sakatani, the former Jap
anese finance minister, who has sug
gested in speeches at New York that
Japan would take up the alien land 1
issue again as soon as the war is
over, is in nu wa:y r-uhorized to speak
in for the foreign office, and was discus-.
Ln ing the question solely as an influeA;
, tial statesman representing a large
le body of Japanese public opinion.
e, The embassy statement follows:
"A press report concerning Japan
d- ese-American relations that appeared
b in several papers this morning, con
e- taining views said to have emanated I
th from this embassy, contained several U
le misrepresentations.
Is "Among other things, the most glar
ing are statements concerning the im
s migration and the California land law
`c- matter.
ie "As to the question of the Japanese f
Ln immigration into this country, Japan
th has for the present nothing whatever
o to negotiate about. What is generally
of known as the gentlemen's agreement
'd. is being observed to the satisfaction
es of our two countries. Whatever is ob
it- jectionable in the proposed immigra
to ton bill of the United States has been
deleted.
"The California land law controver
sy may be said to be in abeyance
1- since, as is apparent by the published
ly correspondence between the Japanese
a and the American governments, neith
an er government has yet arrived at a
final disposition of the question. How
ever, whether or not Japan will renew
her protests in this matter at the end
ag of the European war, or whether she
at will revive the controversy in one,
ad form or other at all, this embassy has
at not the least knowledge."

Splact heing, wh're the Danube leaves
Bulgarian territory and flows north
west through RIoumania. It is a stra
tegic point and once a formidable Rou
manian army has crossed here, it is
anticipated that a drive toward the
Bulgarian seaport of Varna will be be
d gun.
The object of such a move would be
to isolate the German, Bulgarian and
Turkish troops operating against the
Roumanians in the north. Varna, on
the Black sea, is but 90 miles east of
I Turtukai. It is Bulgaria's chief port
and its loss would be a severe blow to
the Central powers.
The Roumanian statement telling of
the crossing of the troops and the Ber
D. lin report admitting the invasion, do
not offer any details. Howeve*, it
seems logical that once across the riv
er, the Roumanians will conduct a vig
orous campaign to carry the war on
iny into Bulgarian territory.
an The Roumanian army, which was
fes sadly defeated recently in Transyl
ra- vania, has returned to the struggle in
ras that region and is reported to have re
by covered some of its lost ground. The
rae advance was made on both sides of

the vicinity of Orsova and near Petroseny,

sitions from the Roumanians.
