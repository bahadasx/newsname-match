The platform, reported by the

lutions. Senator Robert W. Simonds
of St. Johnsbury was adopted pre
cisely as written by the committee.
With no debate the platform was
adopted. In this respect the con
vention closely resembled previous
gatherings.
The state committee was elected
as follows, each county, when called
by the secretary, nominating its
choice: Addison, M. F. Barnes of
Chimney Point; Bennington, E. E.
Potter of Pownall; Caledonia, J. R.
Searles of St. Johnsbury; Chitten
den, A. L. Sherman of Burl
ington; Essex, H. B. Arriey of Island

Skinner of Newport; Rutland, B. L.
Stafford of Rutland; Washington,
Morris Dewey of Montpelier; Wind
ham, J. E. Piddock of Saxton's
River; Windsor, A. E. Watson of
White River Junction.
The address of the afternoon was
given by George W. Wickersham of
New York, who served as attorney
general during the administration
of President Taft.
Congressman Frank L. Greene of
St. Albans was given a most cordial
reception by the convention and al
though he was not down for a speech
he was asked to respond to the de
mands of the delegates for a few
words.
The platform, adopted without a
dissenting voice, follows:
Believing that the voters of any
body politics are entitled to know
the principles upon which a party
seeks their suffrage, we, the Repub
licans of Vermont.by our representa
tives in State convention assembled,
do hereby declare the principles for
which we stand.
We again renew our allegiance to
that party which from its organiza
tion has stood for the protection of
American citizens and American
rights at home and abroad and
pledge our earnest support to the
platform recently adopted by that
party in national convention as
sembled. We recall with pride the
position taken by Vermont in that
convention which had so large a part
in bringing about the nomination of
our peerless leader, Charles Evans
Hughes.
Appreciating, as never before, the
virtue and power of a united party,
we commend the patriotism of
strong, courageous, and devoted
leaders who have enrolled themselves
once more under our banner and we
urge all Republicans to supreme and
victorious effort under the leader
ship of men like Theodore Roosevelt,
William II. Taft, and Charles Evans
Hughes.
We recognize the fact that agri
culture is the predominant industry
of our commonwealth and the chief
source of our material prosperity
We believe that nowhere in the
United States are there greater agri
cultural opportunities than in Ver
mont, and that our citizens should
be encouraged to remain upon the
farms of our state and that all meas
ures looking to the upbuilding of
agriculture, both in method and
practical results, should commend
themselves to the favorable consid
eration of the general assembly and
that the teaching of practical agri
culture should be prosecuted with
vigor and efficiency.
Good roads are essential and nec
essary for the highest development
of our state in all its phases, and the
proper expenditure of our money
for better highways means new and
higher attainments in all walks of
life, and the extension of highway
improvements to rural communities
will enhance the value of our hill
farms and add pleasure anl profit
to a large rural population. We be
lieve in the continuance of the pres
ent highway policy with such im
provements as will be commensurate
with our changing conditions and
the best methods of road construc
tion, and recommend the expendi
ture of a reasonable part of the
highway money on the so-called back
roads under state supervision.
It is imperative that the citizens
of our state receive the best possible
educational advantages and that
equal opportunities for the securing
of an education be given to all.
Believing in this principle and that
wherever practicable the rural school
should be restored, we favor the
continuance and extension of our
present educational system so that
the same may brf brought to the
highest possible point of efficiency.
We call attention to the marked
industrial progress already achieved
by Vermont under successive Repub
lican administratii;n3,and we declare
for the conservation of our forests
and water powers, and for the con
tinuation of the carnpr.ign for pub
licity that has been so effectively
carried on.
We favor the immediate repeal of
the so-called Perry act.
We believe that the present pri
mary law should be given a fair
trial with such amendments thereto
as the experience of the last primary
election seems to warrant.
We favor the enlargement and ex
tension of our workmen's compensa
tion act.
We believe in the consolidation
rather than in the creation of com
missions, and that the conduct of
the public business should be
thoroughly efficient and as economi
cal as will be in keeping with the
dignity of the state, and that the
state should engage in no new en
deavors until it has adequately pro
vided for those which it has already
undertaken.
