RUSSIANS FURIOUSLY
HACKING TEUTONS
Aggressive in Volhynia. West of Lutsk, Along Whole
Front of the Dniester in Galicia
DIVERGENT REPORTS ARE
All Attempts of the Rumanians and Russians to Advance in
Dobrudja Have Been Stopped by Counter-Attacks of the
Teutonic Allies After Three Days' Battle the Ru
manians Have Captured Austro-German Fortifications
Near Parajd i nTransylvania The Cunard Liner Fran
conia ,in Use as a Transport, Has Been Sunk in the Medi
terranean by a Submarine of the Teutonic Allies Forces
of the Entente Powers Are Now Within Twelve Miles of
Monastir Nothing of Moment Has Occurred on the
Western Front in France.
With tae Russians still vigorously
attacking the A ustro -Germans in Vol
hynia, west of Lutsk, and thence along
the whole front to the Dniester in
Galicia, Emperor William has started
for the front of General Von Linsingen
near Lutsk, where the principal fight
ing Is taking place.
At various places In thia sector and
in Galicia Petrograd asserts that the
Austro-Germans have been defeated.
Berlin, however, takes issue with the
Russian war office statement and de
clares that the only point where the
Russians reached the Teutonic lines
was north of Zubilno, and that here
they later were driven out of the cap
tured positions.
Although there is some divergence
In the official reports from Sofia and
Bucharest concerning the fate of the
force of Rumanians which was thrown
across the Danube into Bulgaria, the
fact is patent, according to a Bucharest
rommunicatlor, that they have ceased
thoir "demonstration." Bucharest adds
that the Rumanians withdrew to the
left hank of the Danube, but Sofia as
rerts that the battlefield in northern
Bulgaria, between Rustchuk and Tur
tukai, where they crossed the liver, is
covered with Rumanian de&.d as a re
sult of their forced speedy retirement
back to their own soil.
All attempts of the Rumanians and
Russians to advance in Dobrudja have
been frustrated by counter-attacks of
the Teutonic- allies. Thirteen cannon
have fallen into the hands of the Rus
sians and Rumanians in this region.
In Transylvania the Rumanians have

BASIS OF MURDER CHARGE
AGAINST F. L. SMALL.
Boston Broker Whose Wife's Body
Was Found in Ruins of Cottage.
Mountain View, X. H.. Oct. 5. Cir
2umstanees on hich the state and
county authorities base the charge of
murder against Frederick L. Small, a
former Boston stock broker, because
of tho death of his wife, Florence A.
Small, a week ago. were outlined in
the district court here today. The
charred body of. Mrs. Small was found
in the ruins of her horns on the shore
of Ossipee lake, bearing evidence that
she h&d been beaten, shot and stran
gled and the house set on fire to con
ceal the crime.
The prosecution closed its case,
leaving the defense free to enter to
morrow iis testimony and arguments
in opposition to holding Small for tile
grand jury. It is understood, however,
that the authorities have not com
pleted their investigation along all
lines. Nothing has been introduced
as yet to show positively whether the
woman was alive or dead when her
husband left home in the afternoon for
a trip to Boston. The fire was notJ
discovered until 10 o'clock that night
Small told High Sheriff Arthur W.
Chandler, after his arrest, according
to that officer's testimony today, that
he kisred his wife goodbye and waved
farewell to her In leaving. The man
who drove him to the station could
corroborate thie, he claimed. George
Kennett. the driver, in his testimony,
stated that Small bade 'Njioodbye" to
someone he did not see.
Dr. B. Frank- Home, the medical ref
;ree, said he had found parts of Mrs.
Small's body covered with a substance
that looked like melted resin. A por
tion of the body had been removed to
.determine the nature of this substance,
he said. Under cross examination Dr.
E. W. Hodson, a former medical ref
sree, eaid the use of resin might tend
:o make destruction of the body com
plete, but the process would be a slow
me.

AN ERROR DISCOVERED IN
REPUBLICAN STATE HAND BOOK
Part of Platform Endorsing National
Platform and C. E. Hughes Was
Omitted.
Hartford. Conn., Oct. 5. An error
in the recently issued republican state
hand book was discovered yesterday
by Chairman J. Henry Roraback of
the republican state central commit
tee. The error has caused some dis
turbance in women suffrage circles
but it is easily explained and several
of the "votes for women" advocates
who .have heard the explanation ex
pressed themselves as fully under
standing the unintentional situation,
an insert has been prepared and will
be put in the hand books not yet dis
tributed and Chairman Roraback has
written to all town chairmen pointing
out the omission and enclosing the
missing paragraph.
The hand books were printed in
Hartford. The copy for the books was
sent to the printing office from the
republican state headquarters which is
near the printing office. "When the
copy left the headquarters it was com
plete. It is evident that one sheet of
the copy was lost on the way and the
omission escaped the proof readers.
The platform paragraph omitted
from the hand book which is a part
of the republican iparty's platform in
Connecticut as adopted by the state
convention despite the omission from
the hand book follows:
"We, the representatives) of the re
publican party of the- state of Connec

hereby pledge our allegiance to the
platform adopted by the national re
publican convention and express our
hearty approval of the republican
candidates for president and vice

THREE SPEECHES IN OMAHA
Discussed the European War, Peace
and American Business.
Omaha, Neb., Oct. 5. President Wil
son disctissed the European war,
peace and American business in three
speeches here today. He declared
America is as ready to fight as an na
tion in the world, but that its cause
must be just. After the war, he said,
this nation must join a league of na
tions to preserve the peace of the
world.
The president came into the middle
west for the first time since the cam
paign began and received what his
political lieutenants characterized the
greatest reception of his career.
The president was cheered by thous
ands during the day. The size of the
crowds and the enthusiasm shown far
exceeded anything he has experienced
since his inauguration. Attracted
here for the celebration of Nebraska's
fiftieth anniversary, thousands of
people from nearby cities and states
packed Omaha's streets and shouted
frantically every time Mr. Wilson ap
peared. It was an impressive demon
stration which greatly pleased the
president and his political advisors.
Omaha was in gala attire for the
day. The celebration, non-partisan
in character and arranged by a com
mittee made tip largely'of republicans,
va given a political touch by the
presence of the president. Ail the
buildings were draped with American
nr.gs. windows were packed with peo
ple during the parade, and bands con
stantly played popular and martial
mugic. Starting with brief -speeches-)
to crowds' in Iowa towns this morning,
Mr. Wilson came Jiere to deliver three
speeches, attend a lunch and dinner,
lead a parade for an hour and then
review it; visit the national swine
show ancl hold several political confer
ences. He left tonight for Long
Branch. X. J., whore he will arrive on
Saturday morning.
While Mr. Wilson made no distinct
ly campaign speeches, ne nevertheless
was in campaign mood. Smiling, he
shook hands with thousnnds of peo
ple, patted Rabies on th ehead, waved
his hat to enthusiastic admirers and
entered thoroughly into the spirit of
Nebraska's semi-centennial celebra
tion. In his afternoon speeches the pres
ident declared that after the European
war the United States will live in a
new age. "For the next decade," he
said, "we have got to serve the world.
That alters every commercial ques
tion; that alters every political insti
tution; it alters every question of do
mestic development." He denied that
"the commerce of recent years has
chiefly consisted of exports, stimulat
ed by the war."
The president stOv.3 throughout the
long parade celebrating the fiftieth an
niversary of Nebraska's statehood. He
laughed when one grizzled old Indian
shouted: "Hello, Woody," and he kept
time with his silk hat when a float
representing an old-time ballroom
stopped before him and a group of
young men and women danced a Vir
ginia reel. He waved his hat time
and again as the marchers cheered him
frequently he bent down to call Mrs.
Wilson's attention to some particultr
feature. At the conclusion of the pa
rade he motored to the national swine
show, returning to his hotel just in
time for dinner.

e McCormick
Sued by Oleary
AMERICAN TRUTH SOCIETY'S
HEAD RESENTS CRITICISM
SEEKS $50,000 BALM
Suit is Based on Statement Concerning
President Wilson's Recent Message
Rebuking O'Leary for Charging Pro
British Tendencies,
New York, Oct. 5. Vance C. Mc
Cormick, chairman of the democratic
national committee, announced late to
day that he had been served with a
summons in a suit for $50,000 brought
against him by Jeremiah A. O'Leary,
president of the "American Truth So
ciety." Mr. McCormick said he had
not been apprised, however, of the
charges upon which the suit was
based. Mr. O'Leary, in a statement
issued soon " afterward, declared that
his purpose in instituting the action
was "to find out first, whether hy
phenism, so-called, is libelous and
second, whether it is inconsistent with
Americanism."
Resented McCormick's Criticism
Mr. O'Leary said he resented a
statement attributed to Mr. McCor
mick, criticizing hiin for sending "an
insulting message" to President Wil
son. In that message Mr. O'Leary cri
ticised the president for "not enforc
ing American rights against Great
Britain," and informed Mr. Wilson
that he would not vote for the re
election of the president. Mr. Wil
son replied that he would "feel deep
ly mortified to have you (Mr. O'Leary)
or anybody like you vote for me," add
ing: "Since you have access to many dis
loyal Americans and I have not, I will
ask you to convey this message"to
them."
In the statement attributed to Mr.
McCormiek appearing October 4 and
upon which Mr. O'Leary said he based
his suit for libel, the chairman of the
democratic national committee was
quoted as having commented upon the
presence of Charles E. Hughes at the
Union League club reception Tuesday
night, concluding with the statement
that there could be no doubt about
Mr. Hughes' position because of his
silence on the message sent to the
president by Mr. O'Leary.
Mr. O'Leary's Statement.
Mr. O'Leary . gave out tonight the
following:
"My purpose in suing Mr. Cormick
is to find out first, whether hyphen
ism, so-called, is libelous, and second,
whether it is inconsistent with Amer
icanism. I also sue him as a chal
lenge, to him to let an American jury
decide whether a protest to the presi
dent bceause he has not enforced
American rights against Great Brit
ain is disloyalty. I also resent the
hideous imputation contained in his
statement that any man running for a
public office could repudiate my vote,
or the votes of millions of my fellow
citizens who think as I do.
"A citizen's loyalty to his country
is not a proper part of a political cam
paign, and, therefore, 1 feel tsat it is
wrong to assert it politically, because
it strikes at the fundamentals of our
citizenship.
"What right would Charles E.
Hughes have to repudiate me? What
right has he to repudiate any voter
who would vote for him? I yield to
Mr. McCormick his right to support
Mr. Wilson and to vote for Mr. Wil
son and no matter how faithless I be
lieve Mr. Wilson has been in protect
ing American lives, property and
commerce, I would never assart that
he was disloyal because ho supported
Mr. .Wilson and . differed from Mr.
Hughes."
May Sue Newspapers.
John R. Jones, attorney for Mr.
O'Leary, declared that Mr. O'Leary
"also intends to begin other libel siuts
against newspapers throughout the
country who have questioned his right
and abused him for sending what he
considered to be a perfectly proper
telegram to the president of the Unit
ed States.'

MILK FAMINE STILL
THREATENS NEW YORK
Dairymen and Farmers Fail to Effect
a Settlement.
New York, Oct. 5. --Efforts to reach
a settlement of the deadlock between
distributors and dairymen which
threatens this city with a milk famine,
failed late today when John J. Dillon,
state commissioner of foods and mar
kets, who is the accredited agent, of
the -Dairymen's League, refused for
his organization to accept the advance
demanded by the farmers unless con
tracts were made on a six months'
basis. He was sustained in his posi
tion by R. D. Cooper, chairman of the
executive committee of the league.
The distributors, led by the Borden
Condensed Milk company, had agreed
to pay the 45 cents per one hundred
ponds increase in price upon which
the league members insisted, but up
on the stipulation that it should be
for the month of October only. The
added condition was imposed that an
impartial investigating commission,
satisfactory to both sides to the con
troversy, should be appointed by May
or Mitchel for a further investigation
of cond itiows-.; '"
- The- ffe-F: -it wa9"-announced, was
subject to the approval of the district
attorney. It was conditioned also, "up
on the dealers receiving, as heretofore,
milk from ther former patrons
promptly and wthout hindrance."
Under this offer the price paid to
farmers for grade B milk would be
$2.39 a hundred pounds. A statement
issued in behalf of the milk dealers
said:
"This price is made simply to our
individual farmers. It is not made
with any league or with Commission
er Dillon and our business arrange
ments with the farmers will be as
heretofore as between the various
companies and themselves."
Representatives of the various inter
ests involved were in conference this
afternoon when the announcement
reached them that the Borden com
pany had decided to meet the produc
ers' demands for a higher price. The
offer was made, it was said, in be
half of the public.
"The babies must come first and the
milk companies second." said Vice
President H. N. Hallock. "So, al
though we . feel the increase is ex
cessive, we have decided to meet it."
The other distributors decided they
would be forced to follow the lead of
the Borden company which handles
one-fifth of the 2,500,000 quarts dis
tributed daily in this city.
NEW JERSEY BLACKSMITHS
ARE AIDING DAIRYMEN.
Are Refusing to Shoe Horses of Farm
ers Opposed to League.
Newton, N. J., Oct. 5 Blacksmiths
having shops in farming districts near
here have enrolled themselves in the
aid of the dairymen striving to get an
advance in .he price of their milk, and
have notified farmers not enrolled in
the dairymen's league that they will
refuse to shoe their horses or do their
repair work unless they join in the
fight.
Continuance of night raids on dairy
houses and serious trend of alleged
boycott measures has resulted -in ap
peals to Sheriff Wilson to send armed
deputies to non-league dairies and to
permit employes of those places to
carry arms for self protection. Bank
ers handling the accounts of dairy
farmers and dealers from whom they
purchase stick have been notified, it
was reported today, to "get in right"
with the dairymen or be prepared to
lose their business.

Advised Wives and Women
York Carmen to Go
300 WOMEN COMPLIED,
Police Swb-ft Nightsticks Right
Women Were Bruised A Crowd of Strikers Went to
Aid of Women, But Were Driven Back by a Few Pa
trolmen When Police Reinforcements Arrived the Mob
Fled, Leaving Nine Prisoners, Six Women and Three
Men in the Hands of the Police During the Disturbance
a Crosstown Car Was Wrecked.
New Tork, Oct. 5. Spurred on by
the exhortations of "Mother" Jones,
labor agitator, 300 wives and women
relatives of striking street car men
battled with the police late this after
noon in the most serious riot since
the walkout on the traction lines be
gan a month ago. Night sticks were
swung right and left' by the police and
many of the women were bruised.
Scores of the rioters carried babies in
their arms.
A crowd of strikers who had con
gregated around tho uptown hall
where a meeting, addressed by "Moth
er" Jones was held, entered the fray
on the side of the women and were
driving back the few patrolmen on
the scene, when an automobile load
of bluecoated reinforcements arrived.
The reserves plunged into the midst
of the struggling mob and wielded
their clubs without mercy. When the
rioters finally fled they left nine pris
oners six women and three men in
the hands of the police.
The trouble began when the women
poured out of the hall where "Mother"
Jones had exhorted - them to "get the
'scabs' off the care."
"You are too sentimental," she had
cried, "staying at home thinking of
dress and trinkets when you ought
to be out raising h 1."
Trooping out into the street the
women hooted and jeered crosstown
cars in Eighty-sixth street. Suddenly
a chunk of asphalt was hurled
through the window of a car stalled
by a big automobile truck. This
seemed the signal for a general attack
on the car and in less than a minute
every window was shattered. A pa
PROTECTION OF LIFE ,
" ALONG THE BORDER
Discussed by Joint Commission With
out Agreement.
Atlantic City, N. J., Oct. 5. Vari
ous plans for the protection of life and
property along the border again were
discussed today by the Mexican
American joint commission but with
out agreement. Two sessions were
held ,the second lasting until night.
Both Mexicans and Americans still
hope that the conferences may be
brought to a satisfactory close by Oc
tober 15, but evidence of doubt on the
part of some of the members of the
commission was apparent today.
At least four plans for border con
trol have been suggested, two by the
Americans and two by the Mexicans,
all involving the question of the
withdrawal of General Persingis army
from Chihuahua. The Americans have
steadily insisted that Mexico's internal
problems, especially the operation of
decrees affecting foreigners as well as
the ability of the Carranza govern
ment to afford protection to foreigners
and their property, must be considered
as an integral part of any agreement
for border control.
The Mexicans have acceded to the
attitude of the Americans, although
not without reluctance. Whether the
discussions today brought the com
missioners any closer to an agree
ment was neither admitted nor denied.
The details of the plans suggested
were not revealed.

BATTLED WITH POLICE
and Left and Many of the
trolman who was on strike duty on
the car escorted the forty or fifty pas
sengers into the street and then
charged alone into the crowd of jeer
ing women. He was helpless, however,
until assistance arrived.
Meanwhile the car was being wreck
ed as piece after piece of broken as
phalt from a pile on the sidewalk was
hurled at it. The motorman and con
ductor were lost to sight after several
women clambered aboard the car and
pulled them to the street. The men's
clothing was torn, their faces scratch
ed and bruised. It was not until the
automobile load of reserves arrived
that a semblance of order was re
stored. One of the women arrested charged
the police with dragging her infant
child from her arms. She asserted the
child was left on the sidewalk and two
hours after the riot'no trace of it had
been found.
Before the meeting of the women
closed a committee was appointed to
arrange for a women's parade from
Union Square to the city hall where
an attempt will be made to see Mayor
Mitchel. The parade probably will be
held next Monday.

discussed but no statement was issued
after the conference and those who
participated were reticent as to what
took place.
GERM IN ADENOIDS
OF PARALYSIS VICTIMS
Produced Paralytic Affliction When
Injected Into Lower Animals.
New Tork, Oct. 5. A peculiar germ
found in small abscesses in the tonsils
and adenoids of victims of infantile
paralysis has produced an affliction
similar to infantile paralysis when in
jected into lower animals, according
to Dr. E. C. Rosenow of the Mayo
Foundation at Rochester, Minn., who
addressed a meeting of the New Tork
Academy of Medicine tonight
Dr. Rosenow said that experiments
had been conducted by himself and
other physicians of the Mayo Founda
tion of rabbits, guinea pigs, monkeys,
cats and dogs. He declared marked
improvement was shown In cases of
Infantile paralysis following the . re
moval of the tonsils and adenoids.
When cultures made from the
germs found in the abscessed tonsils
and adenoids of patients were injected
into the lower animals, Dr. Rosenow
added, the paralysis developed in from
24 hours to ten days. The time de
pended, he asserted, not on the
strength of the virus, but the size of
the injection.
