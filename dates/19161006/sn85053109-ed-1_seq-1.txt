VOL. VII. NO. 12
CUT BANK, TETON COUNTY. MONTANA, FRIDAY, OCTOBER 6, 1918.
Two Dollars Per Year
Payroll Biggest
In G. N. History
September G. N. Payroll
at Local Terminal
Over $15,000
The September railway pay
roll in Cut Bank was the largest
in the history of the Great
Northern railway in Cut Bank,
is the assertion of those in
position to speak authoritat
ively. "I venture to say that
the payroll in September, for
roundhouse, depot, industrial
track, track laborers, coal chute
and for the extra crew on the
roundhouse addition will total
$15,000.00" said one citizen in
the employe of the Great Nor
thern who is in very close
touch with the company's local
affairs.
The payroll for October will
be equally as large if not larger.
Men are being added constantly
to the force of permanent em
ployes, as traffic is steadily on
the increase and the Cut Bank
terminal continues to grow in
importance. The great problem
at present is locomotive powe r
to handle the increasing freight
traffic. More loco power will
be added and this will mean
more men.
Work on the large addition to
the roundhouse will continue
until some time in November,
it is stated. This work is en
gaging a large extra crew. About
fifty men have been at work on
the elevator sidetrack.
The railway activities here
mean much to the town. All
the provision places report a big
increase in business, hotels,
boarding houses and rooming
places are taxed to capacity.
Threshing crews and grain
haulers who are compelled to
remain in Cut Bank over night
are finding it very difficult to
lind lodging. Cut Bank is to
day the liveliest town in this
part of Montana—and undoubt
ly the most prosperous.
Organize Club
A score of our progressive
young men met in Atty. Rig
ney's office last Monday eve
ning and set in motion a splen
didly positive movement, The
Cut Bank Athletic Club. The
object of the organization will
be to develop a healthier,
happier and more vigorous
community. It will insure to
its members such physical and
mental vitality as will best
enable them to enjoy life to its
fullest extent.
The Club will give a reception
in their new gymnasium next
Monday evening, Oct. 9lh at 8
P. M. which will be free to the
Eublic. President Fairbrother
as arranged some snappy
athletic contests between some
of our old timers.
This organization is on a firm
financial basis and has come to
stay. Three live wires have
been elected to prompt the suc
cess of the club. George S.
Durland, Pete Ruetten and C.
C. Sherman. Edward Hall will
act as secretary-treasurer,

How Does This Set
«Friend Voter?
How does this set around
your neck, Mr. Voter? It is
copied from the Dutton Sentinel
of September 22.
We think that the people of
this section would do well to sup
port Ledgerwood as commis
sioner, as a commissioner living
in our community would
naturally do more lor us than
one living further away.
Yes? But do you live in the
Dutton community, Mr. Voter?
And, if you don't live there,
where are you going to come in,
if the demo; ^atic candidate is
elected? The Sentinel's well
meant but puny boo?t leaves
abundant grounds for the in
ference that Dan Ledgerwood
will be a commissioner not for
the people of Teton County,
but for the people of only a sec
tion of the county, and a limit
ed section at that. And, getting
right down to brass tacks, that
is the real motive behind his
candidacy, and all the strength
there is to his campaign. No
particular claim is urged in Mr.
Ledgerwood's favor, except
that he will look out for his
own neighborhood. In other
words, 1st the people of Spring
Valley, of Belleview, Raymond
Power, Red River, Cut Bank,
Choteau, Bynum, Fairfield, Bole
and other precincts vote foi
Mr. Ledgerwood, in order that
Fowler precinct, which is Mr.
Ledgerwood's home precinct,
may have some extra advantage
in the way of the roads; and
this, not because Fowler pre
cinct needs the advantage, but
because it would have a com
missioner and would get some
thing at the expense of other
sections of the county. Fine!
That is fine for Fowler, but
how about the rest of us?
County Commissioners in Teton
County are county officers.
They don't represent their hon e
precincts only.
By the way, this little piece
appeared in the Sentinel im
mediately after Mr. Ledger
wood's recent visit to Dutton.
Mr. Voter, why is Dan Led
gerwood so painfully keen to be
a county commissioner? What
special or personal interest does
he wish to serve? Two years
ago the people of the county let
him know that they didn't want
him in the office, when they
elected hi« opponent, Mr. Jacob
son, but now he bobs up again,
and is so intense in his efforts
to be elected that the voter
naturally asks why he wants
the job.
Over and against this kind of
a claim on the office of County
Commissioner, just consider the
substantial claims and qual
ifications of Frank Stufft, the
republican candidate, who will
serve all of the people fairly.

Teton County Republican
Committee.)

Stewart and Mitchell to Ring the
Tocsin Wednesday—Pray and
Edwards Thursday
Charles Pray, the man who
rendered greater aid to the
homesteaders in Montana than
any other public man—and at a
most critical time by securing
the passage of the commutation
and three-year homestead acts
for northern Montana; will be
here next Thursday evening to
address the voters on republican
issues. Charley Pray is inv
mensely popular in this part of
the state and ought to be greet
ed with a packed house.
Frank Edwards, republican
candidate for Governor and one
of the most forceful speakers in
the state, will also be here on
the same night. This republi
can rally will be one of the top
liners in the campaign. People
from ail over the county are
expected to be here next Thurs
day evening, to hear two of the
big men of Montana.
Next Wednesday evening
local democracy will kindle the
red fire, sound its shrill reveille
in clarion call to the faithful
and go forth in its "biled" shirts
and Sunday ginghams to hear a
Jeffersonian message, pure and
undefiled.
Governor Sam V. Stewart
will be the star film in the
movie and will make the tocsin
shriek and the welkin ring with
praise of the state and national
administration. Sam, they say,
has the gift of gab and no doubt
his speech will prove interest
ing. As governor of the best
state in the West our good folks

The 'Citizen's' Feurile Argument
As a sparkling instance of po
litical inconsistency, the following
article from a recent number of the
Brady Citizen is called to the at
tention of the voters of Teton
County.
'"We sincerely hope thetaxpayers
of Teton county, and especially
those in this portion, will seriously
consider the question of good wide
awake representation on the county
board, when they go to the polls in
November.
Are you satisfied with conditions?
Does the road question suit you?
Are we getting-value received for
money expended? Do you get
benefits and improvements accorded
other sections?
After you think «bout these ques
tions, look up Dan Ledgerwood's
record as a farmer, as a business
man, as a citizen. Can you do any
better for county Commissioner?
Think this over "
Now the Brady Citizen is a de
mocratic newspaper, at least it is
that to a conservative degree. The
board of commissioners of Teton
County is likewise democratic, two
to one. The Citizen is persumably
dissatisfied with the present board,
democratic as it is; and it would
improve conditions by making the
board more democratic than it is by
liaving all of the members demo
crats.
The Citizen expresses by infer"
ence the very general and out
spoken dissatisfaction of people of
all political parties in all parts of
'he county with the record of our
present democratic commissioners.
But why make the board unan
imously democratic?
trank Stufft is the remedy. Mr.
Stufft hag been successful in the
management of bis own affairs. He
is a farmer and stockman whose
home is in the Red Hiver country.

CHARLEY PRAY
turn out and give him a warm
hearty welcome.
Harry B. Mitchell, candidate
for congress, will also deliver
an address. Mr. Mitchell is
making his maiden voyage over
the "mined" political pond and
trying hard to dodge the pero
seopes of popularity that, have
been placed just beneath the
waves by Jeannette Rankin
and Mr. Farr. Harry, who is a
member of the Great Falls Trib
une staff when at home, is a
mighty fine fellow. It's too bad
that so many of "these here"
newspaper men get so meddle
some in politics, but, anyhcw,
we'll all be glad to welcome Mr
Mitchell to our "bootiful city."
The ceremonies will begin at
Brown's hall about 8 o'clock.
north of Cut Bank. In every way
Mr. Stufft is admirably qualified for
the important office of county com
missioner, and he comes from a sec
tion of the county that is entitled to
representation on the board. From
the Canadian line to the Marias
river, he is well known to prac
tically every voter aud thoroughly
liked by all who know him. Iiis
acquaintance farther south in the
county is not so extensive, but as
the campaign progresses lie will be
more generally known to the people
of all sections of the county, and
thai will insure his success at the
polls.

Coram Murder a
Shocking Affair
Husband, Crazed With Bad
Booze, Kills Wife and
Orphanes Four
A lamentable tragedy occured
at Coram last Saturday, when
Thomas Gould, a citizen of that
place, shot and killed his wife
without any apparant cause,
death resulting instantly. It
is said that he has been drink
ing heavily the last few weeks
and it is presumed that he was
made temporarily insane by
the use of intoxicants.
Witnesses say that the vic
tim of his terrible deed was ad
vancing toward him and im
ploring not to shoot her when
he discharged the weapon,
which was a 30-30 rifle. He
then turned the rifle on himself
and fired three shots, all of
which missed.
"'I was drunk—crazy—I guess
I don't remember anything
about it, I can't realize yet that
I did it. I don't see how I could.
I didn't realize anything until I
was in the automobile and the
sheriff was shaking me. I let
the booze get me once too often
I've tried to keep away from
the damn whiskey because it
has made me crazy lots of
times, but when I'd get into
town I couldn't keep from get
ting full. I was drunk, that's
all. I don't know what I done.
Whatever the people want to
do with me, it will have to go
that way/ says Gould.
Gould, who was a man of 45
or 46 years of age, was em
ployed in the woods near Co
ram. By his rash act four little
children are left without a
mothers care and love, who will
be dependent upon the tender
mercies of neighbors and friends
Gould seems unable to give any
reason for committing the deed,
and is now held in county jail
to await trial.
