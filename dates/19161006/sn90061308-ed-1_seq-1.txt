of alleged Rumanian atrocities in Do

agency, "are contained in a report
from t.hp Sofia corresDondent of the
Frankfurter Zietung, who with sever
al other correspondents investigated
reporst in Dobnc, Sinntna, and sur
rounding towns and villages." The
correspondent writes:
"Elsewhere we followed traces of
assassinations and incendiarism and
everywhere there was the same com
plaint about the loss of life and prop
erty. Entire villages were destroyed
by fire and large quantities of corn,
as well as people from all classes were
carried away, partly by violence and
partly by false promises. The pret
tiest girls were driven into the Ru
manian trenches where they were as
saulted and then murdered, especially
in the neighborhood of Silintria. Wom
en and children were locked up in
houses, then either burned to death
or shot. It has been found that the
Rumanians ravaged the country in an
indescribable fashion on the direct
command of their superiors.

SPEND YOUR MONEY where you live. PATRONIZE your fellow-townsmen.
They are the men who give empoyment to your
friends, and who make your town prosperous. They have invested
their capital here and that investment is not alone of benefit to
them. It improves the town as a whole. Our citizens should take
pride in our town.
The officials of this bank are proud of our town, and we endeavor
to impress on all whom we meet our belief in its present prosperity
and its bright prospects. Did it ever occur to you that it is you, we,
and our neighbors who make our town what it is? Speak well of
the town you live in, and do your share in the making of its pros
perity by trading with our business men spending your money in
your own town.
Unnecessarily spending money out of town is just ike drawing more
cash from your bank account than you deposit. The resut is ulti
mate bankruptcy for yourself and your fellow-citizens.
