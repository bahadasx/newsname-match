UP II MIS OVER
HUITZHI n
Nearly 50 citizens of Caldwell, out
raged by the farce o^sending a crimi
nal to the insane asylum that he might
escape the penalty of the law, have
taken the extraordinary step of peti
tioning the board of county commis
sioners to employ special counsel to
prosecute the case against E. V.
Huntzberry, charged with a revolting
crime. These citizens, friends and
neighbors of the outraged families,
are justly indignant at the proceedings
which took place in the probate court
Friday of last week whion said Huntz
berry was adjudged insane. They are
up in arms. The petition asks the
board of county commissioners to em
ploy special counsel to prosecute
Huntzberry owing to the fact that
Prosecuting Attorney Griffiths has
failed to do so, and, in their judgment,
has no intention of so doing. Thé
petitioners also condemn the authori
ties who participated in the action;
the manner in which it was done; and
the secrecy which prevailed.
Petition Numerously Signed.
The petition and signatures re
ferred to above were numerously
signed. It appears elsewhere on this
page of The Tribune. The petition
was circulated by Mr. Mat Wentz, the
complaining witness against Huntz
berry. Mr. Wentz said that he could
get two hundred and fifty signers if he
deemed it necessary. The people of
the community feel outraged and in
dignant, says Mr. Wentz. They con
demn the manner and means of pro
tecting Huntzberry from the law. The
secrecy which prevailed; the fact that
outside doctors, who together with
the regularly employed county physi
cian, were employed; are particularly
galling to the people of Caldwell.
Mr. Wentz stated that inquiry at
the court house in the office of the
sheriff resulted in the statement by a
deputy sheriff that no such steps were
under consideration. The complain
ing witness in this case was not (noti
fied of the proposed action and neither
were other persons interested.
"We the petitions," continued Mr.
Wentz, "have no hopes of securing
the prosecution of Huntzberry. We
are taking this means of showing our
indignation and sense of shame at the
outrage" that has been perpetrated.
All Officials Involved.
"Naturally we feel the greatest in
dignation at the action of Attorney
Griffiths. However, the other county
officials are entitled to censure and
condemnation. It seems that a con
spiracy of silence was organized and
participated in by all concerned. Some
very ugly charges are being made in
connection with this case. I do not
care to repeat them as I cannot sub
stantiate them at the present time.
The action carries with it its own con
demnation. The secrecy, the bringing
in of outside doctors, the denial of the
fact that the prisoner was to be ex
amined on the charge of insanity, the
silence of county officials, each and
all condcmn the action taken as un
usual."
Letter to Griffiths.
Mrs. Wentz was in the east this
summer. She was interested in the
case aind wrote Attorney Griffiths
asking when Huntzherry would be
brought to trail as she wanted t*o re
turn home in ample time should her
testimony be needed. Griffiths failed
to reply to the letter.
Friday, Mr. Sanderson heard a ru
mor to the effect that Huwtzberry
was to be examined as to his sanity.
He went to the court house and was
informed by a deputy sheriff that
there was nothing to the story. No
such action is even thought of were
the words used by the deputy in re
ply to Mr. Sanderson's inquiry.
WELL PLEASED WITH

HUNTZBERRY ADJUDGED IN
SANE IN PROBATE COURT
Author of Heinous Crime Is of Un
sound Mind Now.
E. V. Huntsberry was adjudged in
sane in the probate court Friday
afternoon of last week. The board of
examiners consisted of Dr. T. D
Farrer of Caldwell, Dr. H. P. Ross of
Nampa, and Dr. Wm. B. Lyman of
Boise. Huntzberry was committed to
the insane asylum and will be taken
there soon.
Huntzberry was arrested about a
year ago. He was charged with a
revolting and disgusting crime against
nature. He has been in the custody
of the sheriff during the past year.
People Interested Uninformed.
The action was taken without the
knowledge of the complaining witness.
The doctors were apparently brought
here for the purpose of adjudging
Huntzberry insane. The officials at
the court house seemed to keep the
proceedings quiet purposely.
The complaint was sworn to by
Prosecuting Attorney H. A. Griffiths
and is as follows:
Information of Insanity.
In the probate court of the county
of Canyon. State of Idaho. In the
matter of the insanity of E. V. Huntz
berry.
State of Idaho, County of Canycxn, ss.
H. A. Griffiths being first duly
sworn deposes and says, that affiant
is acquainted with E. V. Humtsberry
whom affiant believes to be insane;
th'U said E. V. Huntzberry is so far
disordered in mind as to endanger
health, persons or property.
Wherefore, Complainant prays that
the said E. V. Huntzberry may be ex
amined by this court, pursuant to the
statute in such case made and pro
vided, concerning the charge of in
sanity, and to ascertain the fact of
sanity or insanity; and if the said E.
V. Huntzberry shall be found on ex
amination t*o be insane, that he may be
committed to the insane asylum.

WOMEN WILL HOLD
MASS MEETING AT BOISE

day evening, October 9th, at 8 o'clock,
in the Pinmey Theatre. Two women
of national reputation, Mrs. Sara Bard
Field of California, and Inez Milholl
and Boissevain of New York, will be

Mrs. Field was one of the two
envoys sent last September from the
Voting Woman's Convention, held in
Sam Francisco, across the continent by
auto, to bear petitions to the presi
dent and congress and say to them
that voting women are deciding "to
put the principle of enfranchising all
women above party affiliations."
None is more beloved today in this
great cause of nation-wide suffrage
than this frail, gentle woman. She
was chairman of Oregon when the
women won their franchise, and has
helped in five other campaigns, is a
talented writer and a very delightful
speaker.
Mrs. Boissevain has done brilliant
work in eastern campaigns for suf
frage, and is a young woman of ex
ceptional 'beauty combined with ex
cellent judgment. She is on the
advisory council of the Congressional
Union, and has kept in touch and
aided in the active work of the past
three years and a half for federal
suffrage. She is now on a five weeks'
tour of tile "free" states, making once
more the appeal of the unenfranchised
that women with votes make it so
clear that they will .not support a
national party opposed to the political
freedom of women, that this great is
sue will be promptly settled.

PURE FOOD VIOLATION
CASE DISMISSED
County Attorney Griffiths Refuses to
Prosecute Case.
Mr. Dunning, assistant attorney
general, and Mr. David J. Elirod of the
State Pure Food Commission, were in
Caldwell Tuesday to assist in the
piosecution of a person charged with
the violation of the state sanitary
laws. County. Attorney Griffiths re
fused to have anything to do with the
ase and consequently it was dis
missed. Assistant -Attorney Genera!
Dunning stated that the case was clear
and that he cannot understand the
position of Mr. Griffiths unless it were
that exigency of politics interfered.
Mr, Vail, a well known farmer, was
charged with having sold milk from
his farm, while there was a case of
typhoid fever on the place.
Milk Breeding Place.
One of the easiest methods of dis
seminating typhoid fever is by means
of milk. The typhoid germ propo
gates very rapidly in milk. For this
reason every civilized community in
the world safeguards its milk supply
from typhoid fever. Caldwell alone is
an exception.
Mr. Dunning was very plainly dis
gusted with the attitude assumed by
Mr. Griffiths and did not fail to so
express himself.

Bannock was so safely Republican
this year that a nomination was
quivalent to election.

Republican this year by an old-time
Republican majority. He expects
every state candidate to go in with a
whoop.
Mr. Elrod was one of the most
prominent and useful members of the
last session. His many friends
throughout the state say that he is as
sure of election as he feels himself
to be.

FINE WEATHER MAKES
IDAHO STATE FAIR
GREAT SUCCESS
The Idaho State Fair is being heiil
in Caldwell this week. The attend
ance is breaking all records. The ex
hibits, with the exception of fruit, are
larger, more varied and better than
ever before. The amusement features
on the grounds are all that could be
asked for. The people express the
livliest satisfaction with the fair.
The fore part of the week was
cloudy and it looked as though bad
weather was likely to prevail. Wed
nesday the weather cleared up. Yes
terday it was ideal. First rate weath
er is promised for the balance of the
week.
Records Broken.
The gate receipts Wednesday broke
all previous records of the fair as
sociation. In fact the receipts the first
day were $200.00 greater than the best
first day previous to this fair. The
receipts yesterday went far beyond th e
best day in the history of the fair.
Today will be greater still as this is
the big day of the week.
Manager Miller expressed himself,
yesterday afternoon, as highly grati
fied with the fair to date. He said:
"The fair is a success from every
standpoint. The attendance will be a
record breaker. The exhibits and the
amusements on the grounds are up to
standard. '1 he exhibits are splendid.
I could not ask for better than we
have received. The officers of the as
sociation are well pleased.
President B. M. Holt and Secretary
Gowcn also express themselves as
satisfied in every respect. The direc
tors and others in authority were too
busy to be interviewed.
Premiums Later.
It was impossible for The Tribune
to furnish premium winners this week.
An effort will be made to publish a
complete list as soon as it is officially
made up. The judges were still award
ing premiums and will continue to do
so today.
The livestock exhibit is the largest
ever gathered together in Idaho.
There are more exhibitors, with more
and better exhibits, than ever attended
a fair in this state before.
The exhibits in every respect are
good. The fruit failure throughout
the northwest this vear prevented a
good fruit exhibit. There is very little
fruit shown. The other products of
garden and field are there in plenty.
Prominent Editor in City.
F. G. Burroughs, editor of the
Rupert Democrat, secretary of the
Rupert Commercial Club, secretary of
the Minidoka Fair association, secre
tary of the Democratic Counay Central
committee of Minidoka county, and
otherwise busy and important man in
his community, was a visitor in Cald
well yesterday attending the Idaho
State Fair. Mr. Burroughs was the
guest of Mr. and Mrs. G. W. Stovel
while in the city.
Mr. Burroughs states that Rupert is
flourishing. They have just held a
most successful fair. The town and
surrounding country is growing
rapidly.
Former Resident Makes Last Visit.
The funeral of Frank E. Warner
whose death took place at Rupert was
held in the Baptist church Sunday
afternoon at 2:30. Mr. Warner was at
one time a resident of Middleton and
a number of people from that vicinity
attended the funeral. The Baptist
minister from Middleton, assisted by
Rev. Dark, conducted the service
which was held in the Baptist church
in this city. The remains were accom
panied from Rupert by Otto Zimmer
man, a son-in-law of the deceased.
The Jones Undertaking company
had the funeral arrangements Ln
charge, and interment was in Canyon
Hill cemetery.
Mrs. Horn Pleasantly Surprised.
A surprise party was given Satur

has charge of the block signal system
in that territory. Mrs. Feigh accom
panied them to Boise, where they
visited another aunt, Mrs. D. W. Mc
Connel. They also visited the Arow
rock dam. Mr. and Mrs. Mead express
themselves as well pleased with Idaho.
Several of the Ladies of the Maca
bees motored to Boise on Tuesday to
attend an installation of officers in the
Boise Review. All the ladies report a
splendid time and declare the Boise

ments were served at the close of the
meeting. Those attending were Mes
