Dishwater, Needles and Tools!
Many Queer Things In Schools
By Mabel Abbott
Twenty-two girls stood at a
long, white enameled table in a
big room in the basement of the
Central school yesterday.
Above the table was a row of
one-burner gas stove. Below it
were drawers.
Each girl had a pan of hot wa
ter before her, and a dishcloth or
dish-towel in her hands, and there
was a familiar clatter of pots and
pans.
It looked like fun.
My recollections of stoves and
hot water and dishcloths and
greasy pots and pans are not par
ticularly pleasant.
But I was "washing dishes."
The girls In Miss Harriet Arm
strong's room were "a class in
Home Economics." The divisions
of the table were "desks," and
the saucepans, knives, spoons,
etc., In the drawers were "equip
ment."
That makes all the difference
ln the world.
Serve l>unch to Teachers.
They had heen making cream
of celery soup. In rows on the
shelves of the clean, cool pantry
stood jams, jellies and canned
fruits they had put up. In a
crock, the vegetables for today's
lesson on mustard pickles were
waiting in brine.
Soon the girls will begin serv
ing daily lunch to eight teachers.
Part of the problem will be to
keep the cost of the lunch inside
of 15 centß.
1 have planned and cooked
many a meal wiJ.' my eye on my
grocer's bill. I *it rather abused
about it. I hadn't found out that
I was studying Home Economics.
It's Fun This Way.
In tbe laundry, three girls
were pratciclng on old-fashioned
washboards. Presently the clean
dlshtowels were hanging ln the
dryer with the table linen from
the day before, ready to be ironed
on the ironing boards beside the
wall.
In the little bedroom, the bed
was neatly made. The dresser
was covered with a scarf stenciled
by the girls themselves. ln the
dining room, the china closet was
full of shining china and silver,
and laid away were artistic can
dle shades, also designed and
made hy the girls, to make their
table look pretty on grand occa
sions.
"I don't like housework. I
never did. But I think If the
schools had recognized
housework as a science, an
art and a baslness when I
waa a little girl, and called n
kitchen sink a "desk" and
pots and pans and paring
knives "equipment," I would
have liked It better in.l done
It hotter, then and ever since.

Peace!
Few words are sweeter than "Peace."
The longshoremen strike is over. There is
peace on the water front.
The coal miners have accepted the new wage
plan. There will be peace at the mines.

"We don't try to teach the boys

Shallow Pool.
Drowned in five feel of water, in the shallow por
tion of the boys' swimming pool at Lincoln Park
High school, the hotly of Robert Foley, age 14, was
removed al 11:30 o'clock Friday.
Tlie hoy's parents. Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Foley, hail
made a frantic search Thursday night for him, after
his failure to return from school, and had enlisted
the aid of police detectives.
Young Foley apparently drowned while a clas< of
40 hoys was taking swimming lessons from Capt. 11.
R. Carter, instructor at the Lincoln pools, late
Thursday.
lie was a member of the hist chiss of the afternoon,
Although one boy in the class told the authorities
Friday that he had seen Robert in the dressing rooiQi
donning his doilies after the lesson, the story is held
as doubtful.
Fail to See Body
It is believed that Young Foley suffered either
from a cramp or temporary weakness, and sank t<>
the bottom of the large pool.
How his body could have lain in five feet of water
without some of the other hoys of the class noticing
it, is something which the police ami school authori
ties cannot determine.
Foley was a beginner in the
swimming classes. He had en
tered the Lincoln Park high
school last month, after graduat
ing from Blsmark school in June.
He had shown good improvement
tn his swimming and was able lo
keep afloat and swim quite well
at the time he took Thursday's
lesson.
After police officers had search
ed all night for the missing boy,
A. J. Foley, the father, visited the
high school Friday morning to
enlist the. school atithoritieH in
a search.

After he had gone, Swimming
Instructor Capt. Carter decided to
make a I borough investigation of
the tanks and dressing rooms, on
the remote possibility that the
schoolboy had met with an acci
dent.
An lie approached the wa
ters of the swimming pool he
-au the naked body of the
Imy lying face upwards under
water at the shallow end of
the tank.
Swimming classes were sus
pended Indefinitely Friday noon
as a result of the accident. Cor
oner Stewart and the police are
Investigating.
"It is a deplorable accident,"
declared Supt. of Schools Gelger
Friday. "We cannot understand
how the boy could possibly have
drowned with so many of his fel
low school boys In the tank at the
same time. However, It occurred
and we are doing our best to un
ravel tbe mystery."
The drowning of young Foley
Is the first accident of a serious
nature to have occurred since the
Lincoln Park tanks have been
opened. The tanks are patroniz
ed by hundreds of persons at both
tbe day and night classes. There
were no night classes Thursday
night.
Capt. H. R. Carter, swimming
instructor, has spent his entire
life in athletic and aquatic in
struction, and.has been reported
as a most careful and efficient in
structor.
