ALLEN DEFEATED HY
CHUCK KENNEY
What is said to have been the
best battle ever staged in the
Southwest was witnessed by a
crowded house Tuesday evening
when Young Allen was defeated
by Chuck Kenney in a fifteen
round go. The men had met a
few weeks previous in a ten
round mill and the referee had
decided the alfnir as a draw and
i return match was immediate
ly arranged. Both men had been
training for the battle and it
appear that Kenney had made
the better headway. The fight
was fast and furious from the
first bell. After ten rounds had
i oiled round the only way the
contest could have been decided
was a draw. No decision was
given and the men were re
matched for a five round bout,
which resulted in Kenney's vic-
tnrv This whs ce i-tninlv a scion-
tific battle and the men werek-r. He is also a stock holder
avenlv matched. Many of the in one of the strongest financial
Allen men thouirht the decision I institutions in the Southwest
hnnld have been a draw, but it
was popular with the house
Allen is a good boy and it
is hoped that a return match
with Kenney will be arranged.
Two preliminary bouts were also
staged which Vere a good exhi
bition of the manly game. Geo.
Krebbs came down from Hachi-
ta as Kenney's manager, which
lso was a factor in Kenney s
gaining the decision, having the
issistance of expert advice.

II. L. KERR FOR
STATE SENATOR I
With the enthusiastic support
.. i I., i '
of every member of his party at-
ready assured. IL L. Kerr, the
candidate for the upper house of
the state legislature from the
13th senatorial district enters
the race under the happiest
auspices.
Mr. Kerr needs no introduc
tion to the people of Luna
county .having made his home
here since he was fourteen
years old. He has been closely
identified with the stock rais
ing industry all of his life and
he has worked faithfully and
consistently for the good of the
community in which he has
made his home. His election to
the senate of New Mexico will
be of immense advantage both
to the district from which he
seeks election and to the state
at large, for he has a grasp on
the problems that confront cv
prv class of citizen in the state
that is surpassed by very few
men in New Mexico.
Not only is he in close touch
with the cattle business, but he
understands the difficulties ot
the farmer and the homestead
and his influence has been
lv instrumental m placing
this bank on its solid tounaa-
tion. where it has the conn-
dence of every business man in
Luna county. Mr. Kerr is a
man with all the enthusiasm of
vouth and with a high ideal of
the duties ot a public servant,
mil if elected, he is certain to
make his mark among the leg
islators of the state as one ot
the far-seeing men of his time
and as one who has the good ot
nis state and district at heart.

RIGHT HERE AT HOME
TELL I S WHO IS !
NOW RESPONSIBLE
Who is now responsible for
the condition of tin- Luna conn-
loads is a question Governor
McDonald should awnsor oolore
he asks for thu support of the
McDonald should awnsor oelore :
voters. Before the first road
commissioners were appointed
McDonald should answer b"forc
a democratic dulogntion was n.
Santa Fe and was asked who
they wanted for their road
board. The delegation, com-
posed of the leading democrats
and best men in the county, de-
cided on Fred Sherman, James
i ll l ru li .. il. in...
. Uhca and Chas. Heath. After
the course of a few months the
governor finally appointed
board. I'D' democrats whom he
had asked for their recommen
dation were surprised to learr
there was not a man on tht
board who they had recommend
ed. Did Governor McDonald ho
this because he thought he was
better acquainted with the men
than their neighbors?
since unii nine men: huh uy our lime. .uacKey nas icas
been various changes in the road , ed the Crystal Theatre for the
board, ihe road tunds nave purpose and will give the people
been wasted. Dr. Swope, one I here an opportunity to come as
jf the present members of tin Incur seeing the games as can
joard. wanted a road to his! be ,jom. witli out actually
mining property in the Tresl being present. Many towns sev-
Hcrmanns mountains.
cording to the financial state
mant $2.;100 wns spent on his
oad. According to Mr. Heath
there was never any appropri
ation for this road at any regu
lar meeting. Still the money
was expended on it just the
same.
Now the county is badly in
need of some road work and
a board. One member has ten
dered his resignation, one is out
of the county and Mr. Heath
thing. If the Governor would
without the power to do any-
appoint a man to fill the vacan-
cv there would be a working
bdfffil. He alone-is responsible
for the present condition. He
ook it upon himself to select
he board and it has been a fail
ure. He has had the resigna
tion of Mr. Kelly for a month
and has made no appointment.
If he will not appoint the men
the people want why does he
not appoint who he wants on
the board and let us nave some
one on which to place the re
sponsibility ?
The board has always been
composed of two democrats and
one republican. Now it makes
no difference to us whether the
board is composed of three re
publicans, three democrats or
three anarchists if we get the
results.
Governor McDonald was no
boubt placed on the ticket this
vein- with the hopes of his
strengthening it. but when we
evicw his attitude toward tne
oad uuestion it can be plainly
seen he can do the democrat
state ticket no good in Luna
county.

ADDITIONAL CHURCH
NOTES AND COMMENTS
The Woman's Auxiliary of the
Baptist church will meet on next
Thursday with Mrs. T. A. Hul
ey. A full attendance is de
iircd. Very interesting were the ser
vices held on Sunday last, by
the Reverend Dawn of the Bap
tist church at the Crystal, by
courtesy of Mr. Greenwood, who
always co-operates' with- his
townsmen in giving gratis the
se of his building for any
jhurch service.
The congregation which has
met with the Methodists have
now grown sufficiently in num
bers to justify a building of
their own, and beautiful lots
have been secured through the
enthusiastic work of Rev. Dawn
md building is about to com
mence.
Columbus is surely of suffi
cient importance to support
several churches now for al
though the residents may not
be strong numerically they are
strong in influence, and visitors
will follow their lead in the sup
port of religious work.
Sundav next the Chaplain of
the New Mexican National
Guards the Rev. Z. T. Vincent
of Silver City, will preach at the
"Y." This in place of the ser
vice which has been held at the
Crystal Theatre, under his di
rection.

eight grades and the high school

given some attention. Typewrit
ing has been put in. the eighth

School is running well. The
great trouble is the short noon
of one hour, but the state law
requires a certain number of
hours. Dr. J. L. Maddox acted
as substitute several days, until
Mr. Southern could report Oc

Mr. Green is building himself

SO WOLVES AND 87
MOUNTAIN LIONS KILLED
From the report of the New
Mexico cattle and horse grower
association it appears that thi
state association of cattlemen is
doing their share towards elim
nating the destructive gray wol'
nd mountain lion, i his report
shows that during the past IS
months the association paid
bounty on 511 grown wolves o
lobos, 27 wolf puppies. 87 growi
mountain lions and five lit"
kittens.
These animals came mostly
from the southwestern part o'
the state, from the counties of
Grant, Luna. Sierra and Socorn
The association paid for thi
limination of these animals
$3,765 which, taking Mr. Ligon'
B oloir cal Survey statement
would have cost the cattlemei
of that paticular section close U
100,000. The cost tor this sa
ing is less than four per cent c
the amount involved. In othc
words through an expenditure o
loss than $4,000 the New Mexiet
cattle and horse growers asso
ciation has saved the cattlemer
of the counties mentioned. $100
000 if Mr. Ligon's figures cai
bo relied upon, and Mr. Ligoi
states that his estimates wen
indeed very conservative.
F. H. Wold, of Rcdlands, Cal
