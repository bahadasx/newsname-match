As the result of a school scrap
in school district No. 40 at Wild
l'ice, this county, a writ of man
damus was issued this morning
by udge Charles A. Pollock, re
turnable Saturday, at which time
Alfred Brunete, a director of the
school district must show cause
Avhy he shall not turn over to the
other two directors of the school
the keys, hooks and other school
property.
The school district in question
is .inhabited almost exclusively
by French citizens, the contro
versy arising over the question
of whether the school shall be
moved from its present location
to a parochial school a mile dis
tant. This matter was brought
"up at a recent special election in
the district which the people vot
ed 21 to 3 to have the school
moved.
It seems that two of the di
rectors of the school, Fred Pron.
ovost and Brunette, are in favor
of the schol being moved, and
have wanted to follow out the
will of the people of the district,
but Brunette has other ideas and
refuses to relinquish the proper
ty in his possession to the other
two directors," in order that the
move cannot be made. The re
sult was that the two directors
in favor of the change brought
action against the third member
•of the board.
It seems that Brunette runs a
•store close to the present location
of the school in the town of Wild
"Rice and had charge of the school
•property.
The question brought out at the
bearing will be most interesting.
One will be whether one direct
or can stand in the way of the
•will of the voters of a district,
and another will be whether stale
school property can be taken to
a sectarian school regardless of
Ihe fact that practically evety
resident of the district is in favor
of such parochial school. —Far

FLOWER SHOWS IN STATE.
Flower shows are new in North
Dakota, due to the fact that this
state, until late years has been
entirely a giipin growing state.
The North Dakota Develop
ment League Press Bureau at
Grand Forks has several articles,
on hand recently, regarding
shows that have been held in dif
ferent towns and cities in the
state.
These shows are held under the
direction of a "Flower Club",
"which is formed and op'erated on
the same plan as a good roads
flub, or farmers' club. The clubs
have, as their main purpose, the
"beautifying of the city or town
'.o which they belong. Vacant
lots are planted with flowers or
0 hedge of some simple flower is
nlanted around it, and people
have private flower beds at their
homes.
About this time of the year, or
late summer, when the flowers
are all in blossom a flower show
*s held on much the same plan
as a vegetable show, and prizes
are awarded for the best exhibit.
If there is some way by which
people can show what (experts
they are in growing flowers, they
•will take more pride in growing
them and the city in which this
's done has a different appear
ance in a few years after the an
nual flowrer show has been estab
llsjaed.
'The county commissioners
were in regular session the first
of the week. They will meet
-Again October 14.

FIRE PREVENTION DAY.
Every year North Dakota and
the whole country as well suf
fers severaly by fires, many of
which might be prevented with
proper care. By reason of this
(ire loss the rales of insurance
are high. If we can only educate
the young people in our schools
and the older people upon the
farms, in their homes and in their
business, to clean up their prop
erty and take care of it, and to
help to prevent fires, we can save
an enormous amount of money
each year preventing fires.
To the end that ihe people of
the stale may eo-operate with the
Stale Fire Marshal's Department
in the reduction of loss by fire,
hereby designate Monday, Oct
ober 9lh, 1916 as Fire Prevention
Day in the State of North Dakota.
This day is the anniversary of
the great Chicago'fire where great
loss resulted through careless
ness and bad conditions, and I
sincerely urge that the citizens of
Ihe state everywhere co-operate
'hat Fire Prevention ©ay may
really mean something in North
Dakota.
Done at the Capitol at Bis
marck, this 25th day of Sept.,

the history of the Unversity of
North Dakota has enrolled at that

Very little of the usual homesick
ness has been felt by these boys

all corners of the stale. A better
system for taking care of the
needs of these young people from
the time of their arrival at the
University, and even before, has
been worked out by ihe Y. M. C.
A. of the University, for the boys,
and by the Dean's Assistant
Council for the girls. Groups of
the Y. M. A boys met each in

groups wore the red badge of the
Y. M. C. A. information commit
tee and guided the new students
to the University. All during the
fiist lew clays, open house was
held at Ihe Y. M. C. A. rooms in

large number of the upper class
men were there fo meet the Fresh
men and give them assistanc in
hir adjustment of their new lo
cation On Wednesday evening a
stag party was given by the
M. C. A., which was attended by
all University men, inculding
both the faculty and student
bodies. It was in the nature of
an informal mixer and during the
evening a presentation was made
of Ihe various University activi
ties so that a clear understanding
of these might be had by the new
men at the start. On Friday
Evening a supper was given for
Ihe Freshmen at the Commons,
Ihe University Dining Hall, for
Ihe purpose of learning the de
nominational choice of the boys.
After the supper, the class was

The Dean's Assistant Council,
which is an organization assist
ing the Dean of Women in the
care of Freshmen girls, has prov
ed itself of great importance.
Under its system every girl enrol,
ed for the first time in the Uni
versity has as her adivsor, one of
!lie upper classmen, a junior or
senior girl, who acts as a big
sister to the girl coming to the
institution. The advisor corres
ponds with her advisee before
the opening of the University and
lulls her of the things she will
need to bring with her to her
new home in the University dor
mitories. The advisor also meets
her advisee upon her arrival at
the University, assiste her to reg
ister and looks after her during
the first year of her residence
at the University. So well was
this system planned this year an
so well were the plans executed,
that every Freshmen girl was
taken care of upon her arrival
:it the stale institution and was
not allowed to feel the usual
homesickness that makes the first
few days in a strange institution
a time of torture. On Friday
evening, the annual "Little Girls'
Party" was given by the Dean's
Assistant Council in the Univer.
sily Gymnasium. It was attended
by ali the "little girls" accompan
ied by their big sisters, their ad
visors, and a large number of
the women of the faculty. It Wf.s
a jolly time when all the women
of the University mixed together
in a care-free get acquainted
party.
Looking after the religious in
terests of both the boys and girls,
the first Vesper Services of the
year was held in Cdrwin Hall,
Wesley College, on Sunday even
ing at 6:45. Dr. E. P. Robertson,
President of Wesley College, was
the speaker and started the stu
dents on their school year with
a friendly talk containing much
valuable advice.
With better manhoods looking
filer the welfare of the students
who leave home for the first time
and with a clearer interest Ihsn
ever before in the physical, men
tal and spiritual welfare of the
students, the University of North
Dakota is becoming an increas
ingly safe and beneficial place
for the young people of the slate.

U. S. Treasurer John Burke

cnce at the Beach Opera House
last Fri. evening when he launched
the opening gun in the Democrat,
ic campaign in Golden Valley
county. A Iar,i/e delegation met
him at the depot and amid strains
of music furnished by the Beach
'sand, in uniform, he was con
ducted to the Opera House, where
h«* 0111 lined Ihe piriform of the
Democratic party and gave a re
view of what had been done by

ncy of old Billings county, before

Burke, is a candidate for United
Slates senator, hoping to succeed
Porter J. MeCumber, the present
incumbent. Naturally his address
dealt to some\»xl"nl with what he
deemed the shortcomings of Mr.
MeCumber, and while, as usual,
he presented his case in a forci
fill way, we feel safe in saying
thai Ihe concensus of opinion
ismong those who heard him is
thai Mr. MeCumber will not suf
fer lo any extent in votes by vir
nc of statements made at the
Opera House last Friday even
ing.
Through the efforts of the build

ing the acttial construction work.
While the building may not be as
large or pretentious as those
found in cities larger than
Ibis it will be a credit to Beach,
not only lo Ihe members of the
local lodge but to the city as well.
The building will be 34x80 feet,
one story and basement, and will
be as convenient as is possible
to make it for the purpose for
which it is to be used. It is
thought that it will be leady for
occupancy within the next sixty
days.
