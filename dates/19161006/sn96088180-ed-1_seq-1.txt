SUGGESTS
E
Renewal of Submarine War
fare Against Certain of the
English Harbors Is Policy
Now Advanced in Germany
Berlin, Oct. 6. A submarine block
ado of certain Kngllib harbors was
nucleated to the government by itv
, ersl tadr of the von Tlrplts fac
tion, advocating a resumption of sub
marine warfare, It was learned today.
The von Tlrplts supporters offered
this suggestion as a compromise. They
urged that such a course would be
In accord with the chancellor's an
nounced determination of prosecuting
a vigorous war against England and
would cut oil English food and am
munition supplies without endanger
ing the Uvea or property of neutrals.
The government la not Impressed
by the suggestion and there Is no
present Indication that It will be put
Into force. The wrangle between the
von , TlrplUltf s and the government
newspapers continues without abate
ment, but the conviction Is growing
that the efforts to overthrow th chan
cellor are doomed to failure and that
, there will be no change In the per-
sonnel of the government during the
war. Americans believe reports that
a new crisis In German-American re
latione threatens are without foun
dation. The preaent relchstag fight appears
to be tho final effort of the conserva
tives, wealthy Industrials, annexation
ists and agrarians to get control of
the government. Their allies are
lobbying and using every effort to
overthrow the chancellor, but
Rethmsnn-Hollweg appears stronger
today than he did last June, when
the fight on him was started.
The government la ahowlng no
weakness, nut Is grabbing the bull by
the horns. Foreign Secretary von
Jagow dally receives leadera of each
Tarty, explaining his position confi
dentially, VIce-ChanreUor Helffertch
does the same. '
A trusted German official, one of
the best Informed men here, who
nowi tha United States and Ameri
can sentiment well, declared confi
dently to the United Press today that
-the preaent political explosion will
not bring tha downfall of either
Chsnoellor von Bethmann-Hollweg or
Foreign Secretary von Jagow. Neither
does It forecast a resumption of reck
less submarining, as some neutrala
seem to believe, ha aald.
"But some Americans fear that the
submarining may commence again,"
ho waa told. "Americana traveling
In Germany are told by bualness men
that submarining should ba resumed."
"It would be Insanity for the gov
ernment to resume the former sub-.
marine policy Just because the wild
Taxes Zettung (one of the most ener
getic supporters of the Ton Tlrpttt
policy) should demand It," the Ger
man official replied. "It would be
Insanity to Invite tho whole world to
enter tha war against Germany un
less there waa absolute proof that tha
war could ba ended Immediately with
German victory.
"I do not believe half the people
of iGermany want the submarine war
resumed. - Even If there waa a change
1n tha chancellorship, the next chan
cellor could not change tha govern
ment's policy without guaranteeing
that he would win tha war by so do
ing. Tha whole object of tha war la
to end It. No one should ba aa wild
as to want tq fight with two-edged
swords and pistols In each hand, when
Tie would Injure, himself .more than
Ills enemy. . . .:

the evidence aought and place tha

Russia Said to Be Negotiat
ing With Countries South
for Placing a Million Rus
sian Poles in Colonies
Washington, Oct. 6. Russia la ne
gotiating with South American repub
lics for the colonisation of over one
million Russlsn Poles In Lavtln A mer
its. , Five hundred thousand will be
distributed In Venezuela, Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia, If the Russian
plans succeed, and the remainder will
be placed In Argentine and Chile.
This was learned by the United
Press today on unquestionable au
thority. Several months sgo a Russian com
mission of It members, en route to
South America, came to Waahlngton
for certain letters of Introduction.
They presented letters here from
Hudson Maxim, the explosives In
ventor and member of the DuPpnt
Powder company, and from Senator
O'Oorman or New Tork.
They received lettera to South
American personages from John Bar
rett, director or the Pan-American
union. They did not go to the state
department for any lettera or recom
mendation.
Upon arriving In South America
the commission split up Into three
groups. One, composed of Joseph
Dallnda, publisher of a financial
paper in Petrograd, and Maro Bounl
mouvitch, a Petrograd banker, went
to Caracas, capital of Venesnela,
where they are now conducting the
negotiations with the ministry or de
velopment. At first they discussed
purely formal matters, chiefly con
cerning possible arrangements to pur
chase Venezuela's entire yearly crop
or coffee, cocoa and mahogany direct
from the growers. Before the war
Russia had bought large quantities
of these Venesuelan products through
French and German houses, princi
pally the latter.
It developed, however, that the
chief object of their visit -and the
Russian visitors were frank about It,
It Is said was to obtain the sanction
of the Venesuelan government to the
sending over of hundreds or thous
ands or Russian Poles to be settled
on agricultural and graslng lands.
Under Venetuela taws, these Im
migrants, U admitted, would each be
entitled to SOO acres or land. The
Russian government, It la understood,
proposed to subsidise the colonists,

Walluoe, Idaho, Oct. 6. On trial
tor killing Clarence Dalqulst, musi
cian, Merman J. Rossi, one of Idaho's
wealthiest men, will attempt to escape
punishment by alleging that Dalqulst
wrecked his home. Thla waa made
evident today by the questions whloh
Defense Counsel W. H. Plummer, of
Spokane, asked prospective jurors.
The defense will attempt to prove
that Dalqulst with a party of friends
visited Mrs. Rossi's home last June
while Rossi waa In Bolae. Liquor is
declared to have been drunk during
the visit.
Rossi returned from Bolae late the
following afternoon. He went direct
ly from his home to Samuel's hotel,

Rings and Other Jewelry
Of Much Value Are Made
Away With By Sly Thief
The police department of this city
has been notified that thieves entered
the room of a school teacher at Boyd's
hotel, at Kerby, and atole a quantity
of jewelry and a $20 bill, the theft
having occurred probably some time

i taken were two solitaire diamond

weight and the other a half carat
There was also a ring with a ruby
setting, the stone a carat In weight.
Gold beads, a chain and locket, and
other jewelry were Included In the
loot taken from the room.
A man who had been working
wound Kerby was suspected of the
robbery, and Chief McLane took him
Into custody when he arrived in thla
city Thursday and searched hla be
longings, but could find none or the
missing property. This man, with a
companion, left Thursday morning
for-4bc north, and at Rosebnrg they
were again searched by officers, still
without results. On the theory that
they were working upon the right
scene, the officers wired ahead to
Portland, and there the search will
be continued, aa It Is thought possible
that the thieves, whoever they may
have been, mailed or expressed the
Jewels to themselves or to pals In
the metropolis for disposition.

their timber holdings In Josephine
county by the assessor and the board
of equalization, three owners of tim
ber lands, through B! U rnhm.A -
parties to the action are Seymour H.
Bell, the Hewitt Land Company, and
Chas. 8. Dickinson, trustee. The
holdings of the parties represent 25
or SO separate tracts.
In making the assessment against
the property, the timber waa valued
by the board of equlllzatlon at SI per
M upon the estimate or merchantable
timber upon the land, thla figure In
cluding the Douglas fir and the cedar.
Practically ail the timber la classi
fied as fir. In the complaint filed 'by
Attorney Richard for his clients, it
la set forth thst the pine should not
be assessed at more than 11. while
fir and cedar abonld not be trained for
assessment purpoaea at to exceed SO
cents per at. Upon this basis, the
vhlue of the holdings - represented
would be only about one-third that
