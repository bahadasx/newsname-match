SENATOR BURTON DEEPLY IMPRESSES
II HOST ATTENTIVE AUDIENCE
Senator Shows Up Mexican Situation and Asks
Why the Need of Over 5,000 Troops on Border
If No War Wilson's Wanton Wobbling Walloped
Senator Theordore E. Burton made
a deep and lasting impression on the
people of Flagstaff Saturday night in
his address1 St the Orpheum theatre.
He was greeted by a full house of in
teligent men and women who listened
earnestly to the message brought to
them by Senator Burton, who is con
sidered one of the best informed men
of the nation today.
It was a lecture, in fact, rather than
a political harang an contained logic
that brought conviction to the think
ing mind. There was no "spred-eagle"
vindictiveness but -a clear reasoning
with the people not parties, as to the
present conditions in the United
States and' "what had brought them
about.
"We aye Americans first," ho said,
"and the right is accorded us to justly
criticise the acts of those who are
elected to.-rep'resent us."
"There ia.jno question as to the
honesty oil President Wilson, but the
vast majority of the people of the
United States have lost confidence in
his administration because of the
vascillating -policy he has persued
from tlmV-to time; we Americans
want to Stand-by the president, but
we want to know first where he stands
in order that' it may be possible to
stand by him.
"The statement that 'he kept us out
of war," is--bne suceptible of many in-terpretatiorist-
"Huerta was the constitutional head
of the Mexican government, made so
by Mexican "Jaw, regardless of his
purpose or' personality; an expedi
tion of "war ships went to Vera Cruz
and demanded that' he salute the
American flag. There was-a battle in
which American soldiers were killed
and many Mexicans. Huerta did not
salute, the American flag, and later
died on American soil.,
""Still, he kept us .dot', of war.'
"Villa, whose reputation as a mur
derer and a bandit, fully known to
Wilson, was a prime favorite and
came near being recognized by this
government; the murdered American
citizens at Columbus was a result of
this, and American soldiers were sent
after Villa to get him "dead or alive."
They are on Mexican soil today, and
fifty thousand more American boys
are doing .duty, such as it is, along the
Mexican border, yet "he kept us out
of war."
"Caranza was recognized, Caranza
the unfriendliest one of the whole
gathering of revolutionists, and the
one who told the American soldiers in
quest of Villa, to "go north," all
other directions being closed by Mexi
can soldiers; Parazel resulted, a battle
in which one troop of American sol
diers were ambushed and nearly wiped
out. " N
"Aside from the soldiers on the
border and the battles fought and the
"war taxes paid," they claim he "kept
us out of .-war."
"There was never 'a shadow of a
chance of getting into war with Euro
pean countries, for had it not been
for the materials bought in the United
States, the. war in Europe could not
have lasted six months; only the most
overt act could have brought about
war entangling America; there is not
one warring country but wants the
friendship of America, and a firm
stand taken by President Wilson
would have prevented even the strain
ed relations. Note writing became a
pastime" to postpone and put off ac
tion, until the United States and her
people were classed as a bunch of
"money grabbers to proud to fight"
"The Utile stalwart country of Den
mark is today holding the proud posi
tion of a neutral mediator which
should have "been the position of the
United Statgs."
Senator .Burton took up the tariff
question and pointed out that the
lumber industry would largely go to
Canada under- the present tariff law;
sheep, wooL-and cattle had struck a
lucky streakbecause of a drought in
Australia anbt South American coun
tries the first year after the law went
into effect, th,en the war created the
demand that kept prices where they
are. We paid, taxes to help make up
the deficit caused by the reduced tar
iff law and there was no "reduction in
the high coitif living" in fact, prices
are higher now than ever, which dis
proves the pe( theory of free traders
that the "robber tariff" did it all.
Following his address, Miss Helen
Todd, the noted woman suffragist,
who was in the audience, having held
a meeting daring the afternoon at the
court house, was called for and from
her position down in front of the
stage, presented the woman's side of
the case and urged the women to
stand for their rights and help her
eastern sisters in getting a right
the same right that many a man north
and south sacrificed his life for dur
ing the civil war, which was given to
the negro, and the same right that
was recently given to 600 Indians in
the Dakotas. She was a pleasant,
fluent talker and won her audience
from the start.
One of the pleasant features of the
visit of Senator Burton to Flagstaff,
was the deep and earnest interest he
took in the real conditions in Arizona,
"a state," he said, "that was much
misunderstood in the east It was a
broad view of the civic side of Ari
zona he wished to take back to the
east with him, rather than merely
political conditions.
That Arizona had been thoroughly
misrepresented in the east by her
"representatives;" was evidenced from
the questions asked by him concerning
state affairs. If no other result is
obtained by Senator Burton's visit,
Arizona has gained one most influen
tial friend at the court of last resort

AZBILLS NOT HANGED, CASE
GOES UP ON APPEAL
The Azbill brothers who were con
demned for the murder of Frank 0.
Thomas, and who were sentenced to
hang on last Friday at the state peni
tentiary at Florence, were not hanged.
An appeal was taken in their case
which necessitated a delay until the
great mass of evidence could be writ
ten up by the court reporter. When
this evidence is written up, which has
taken pretty much all the time of the
court reporter since the ending of the
trial, the merits of the case will again
be gone over on the appeal, with final
results thus put off indefinately.
Recruiting Officer Goes to Phoenix
Lieutenant Charles Price, who has
been on recruiting duty here with a
couple men for the past month or
more, was ordered to Phoenix and left
Tuesday for his new post of duty.
There were not many enlistments
made in northern Arizona, owing to
the fact that few cared to go south
merely for guard duty with little, if
any, active service in sight.
Just as a proof of Lieut. Price's
ability with a rifle, he wandered out
in the woods Sunday and returned
with a good big buck, which weighed
in the neighborhood of 175 pounds.
He took the antlers home to prove
the assertion to. the fellows down
there who will be jealous of his
achievement

Dr. R. B. Knotts, of Yuma, has been
appointed "District Deputy Grand Ex
alted Ruler of the Elks for Arizona.
The appointment came from the
hands of Grand Exalted Ruler Ed
ward -Bighter of "New Orleans, as a
preference over many- other Worthy
Elks in the state who were candidates
to succeed Joe Prochaska, who held
the position the part 'year.
STATE OFFICIALS GATHER

democrats in Flagstaff yesterday, all
on theirgrand tour of the state, prel
senting their claims to the people and
asking for their votes. The party
came in from the east where they
have been holding meetings.
The party consisted of Governor

ing at the Orpheum last night
AJbout the only official left at the
capitol is State Auditor Callighan and
the Janitor; Callighan is not a can

DEMOCRATS IN BIG ROW
OVER LAND OFFICE' JOB
Phoenix, Ariz., Oct 5 A big fight
has developed in the ranks of the Ari
zona Democracy over the selection of
a successor to Thomas F. Weedin as
register of the United States Land
Office.
There arc already five active can
didates for the place, John Irvin of
Phoenix, E. J. Trippell of Tucson,
Mulford Winsor of Yuma, Scott
White of Florence and J. P. Lavin of
Phoenix, Frank Luke is also mention
ed for the appointment
E. J. Trippell is chief clerk in the
office of the Land Commissioner.
Mulford Winsor is the boss of the
state machine and will have the en
dorsement of Hunt J. P. Lavin was
defeated for the nomination for
county attorney in Maricopa county.
It is said to be the plan of Sena
tor Ashurst and Senator Smith to
delay the appointment until after
election although the affairs of the
land office are in such shapo as to re
quire the appointment of a register
immediately.
It is believed that if the appoint
ment can be delayed until after elec
tion, Mulford Winsor will land the
plum but Ashurst and Smith would
election for fear of offending the
not think of appointing him before
large body of Democrats who were
responsible for eliminating him as
head of the land commission.
Winsor is running for the state
senate in Yuma county having vowed
after he was deposed that he would
"come back." He is slated by Hunt
for president of the Senate if the
machine wins again this fall.
Will Organize Hughes Alliance Here
Mr. E. E. Anderson of Phoenix, has
been in Flagstaff this week in the in
tercst of the "Hughes Alliance," an
organization that has for it's object
the gathering together of all elements
who may not be interested in the local
candidates, either county or state, but
who are interested in getting out the
voters for Hughes. They believe that
the, women, under existing circum
stances should be interested in the
Hutches campaign, because of the
stand he has taken for them and be
cause of the stand Wilson has taken
against them. There are many other
votres who are for Hughes, but who
are tangled as to state and local poli
tics. These are the ones whom the
Alliance people wish to align with
them, regardless of other conditions.
Local Forest Officers in Williams
Forest Supervisor John D. Guthrie
and G. T. Bachus who has charge of
the timber sales for the service, were

REPUBLICANS PRESENT THEIR
SIDE OF CASE TO FLAG
STAFF PEOPLE .
Owing to inclemenfweather there
was not as-large an audience out to
greet former governor Kibbey and
party Tuesday evening 88 had been
hoped for, though the Empress
theatre was comfortably filled with
those who were interested in the out
come of the election in Arizona this
year.
"Never before, in all the years I
have lived in Arizona, has there been
such an overwhelmingly strong rep
ublican sentiment manifested," de
clared Governor J. H. Kibbey, rep
ublican candidate for United States
senator, here.
There are several contributing
reason for the change of political
opinion in Arizona and the nation,"
Governor Kibbey continued. "Natu
rally the first is the pressing need of
a 'strong, constructive and permanent
administration of affairs in both the
nation and in the state. Another
reason is the tariff and protection of
American labor and American indus
tries when this present 'war pros
perity' leaves us. And another rea
son is the failure of the democratic
administration to keep pro-election
pledges."
tjovernor Kibbey has been most en
thusiastically received in every city
hi has visited during the campaign.
Thousands of Arizonans who remem
ber the labors of Mr. Kibbey when
he was governor, recall the fair and
impartial decisions he rendered when
justice of the state supreme court,
know of the long, hard fought legal
battles he has waged to secure water
rights for Salt River valley farmers
and of the many other things he has
accomplished jin behalf of the people
of this state, all love and admire him.
They regard him as the "First Ari
zonan." And when he spoke in the
various cities they turn out in great
numbers to hear the straightforward
presentation of the fundamental
principles of true democracy fair
and, impartial government for all
classes, protection for none and dis--crimination
against none.
It is such a man as this, a worker
not an orator; conservative and.
practical not radical, who comes be
fore the voters of this state and ask3 j
them to elect him entirely upon his
record which is one of accomplish
ments and not of oratory.
So great has been the. interest tak
en in the campaign of Governor Kib
bey that it seems as though partisan
saship has been placed in-the discard.
Democrats, socialists, prohibitionists
and republicans all seem to be center
ing their efforts upon the election ,of
a man from Arizona to the senate of
the United States who will realy ac
complish something in behalf of the
people. They want a worker in the
senate. And such a man is Joseph
H. Kibbey.
Other Members of the Party
Joe V. Prochaska, Gila county's
candidate for secretary of state, is
driving the Kibbey party about the
state in his "safety first" car. Mr.
Prochaska has the largest personal
acquaintance of any man in Arizona,
his friends are legion. Every city he
visits he meets many of them who
pledge themselves to work actively in
his behalf. Mr. Prochaska is making
a campaign for a business admini
stration of this important state office.
Judge Otis J. Baughnr the republi
can candidate for Judge of the Sup
reme Court in
his clever ad
Jress, advocated
the fulfillment of
the democratic
promise of a non
partisan supreme
court, a' court
that has hereto
fore been strictly
democratic His
talk clearly indi
cated that he was the right sort of
timber for the supreme bench, and a
man who could be depended upon by
the people to construe their laws
from a just and legal standpoint on
ly. The people of Pinal county elect
ed him superior judge because of his
qualifications and not because he was
a republican, for the county is .dem
ocratic in its tendencies. His friends
say that he will carry his home coun
ty by an overwhelming majority this
fall, because the people believe in
him as a man and as & judge.
Norman J. McKenzie, the candi
date for mine inspector, is a practical
miner, with a splendid reputation as
one who thoroughly knows the un
derground' workings and" the only
candidate who is a practical miner,
having pufcpwv 27' long years at the
business. Hit inspection of'-a mine"
will mean a thorough inspection! ''
T. RUNKE.
ACQUITTED IN TADDy TIN SHOOTIHG CASE
Jury Promptly Returns a Verdict of Not Guilty
Vindictiveness Evidenced by Prosecution when
Runke is Arrested Charged with Perjury
"Not guilty." j any in the State and we also appreci-
Af ter deliberating less than two ate the fact that the people of North-
hours, the jury in the Federal court
;n the case of Ashley Wilson, E. Nash
and D. M. Robertson, charged with
the murder of Taddy Tin, a Navajo
Indian, brought in this verdict early
last night, bringing to a close the
most bitterly fought trial in the an
nals of the Federal court in this city.
Taddy Tin, a gigantic Navajo, was
killed on the Western .Navajo reser
vation during the latter part of last
January. The case was considered by
the Federal grand Jury here during
its session last March and indict
ments, charging murder-were returned
against Wilson, Nash, Robertson and
Superintendent Walter Runke,. of- the
reservation. Runke secured bonds im
mediately after the indictment was re
turned, but the three other men were
held in the county jail here for several
months until they, too, were able to
furnish bonds.
Immediately after the action of the
grand jury the defendants put their
case in the hands of Attorney E. S.
Clark. When the case was called in
the Federal court last week, United
States Attorney Flynn, in charge of
the prosecution, asked that it be
transferred to Phoenix, on the ground
that the sentiment in sympathy with
the defendants in the northern part
of the state would prevent a fair trial
in this city. The motion was denied.
Throughout the trial the prosecu
tion has been relentless, and almost
innumerable attempts made by the
United States attorneys to batter
down the testimony that Taddy Tin
was, shot by Wilson in self-defense.
Frequent personal arguments between
the attorneys enlivened the hearings.
- The defense introduced testimony
tending to show that-Taddy Tin had
the reputation of, being a dangerous
Indian, that the defendants tried to
place him under arrest without using
force and that he was killed only after
he had tried to kill Wilson and Ro
bertson. All three defendants told practical
ly the same story of the incidents
leading up to, and the killing of Tad
dy Tin. They told of having been
instructed by Superintendent Runke
to bring the Indian to the reservation
office and of having abandoned their
first attempt to carry out the orders
on account of bad weather, On their
second, trip to bring in .Taddy Tin,
they said, they had entered a "hogan"
in which he and several other In
dians were talking together, and had
attempted to place him under arrest.
The Indian resisted, they testified,
and with almost superhuman strength
hurled Wilson across the "hogan."
drew a revolver and attempted to fire
at him. Robertson attempted to over
power the Indian but was unable to
do so, it was claimed, and attempts
were made by the Navajo to shoot
him also. Wilson then fired twice,
the testimony showed, and both shots,
although striking the Indian, failed to
cause him to cease his attempts to
fire the revolver. The third shot,
however, killed him.
One of the principal witnesses for
the prosecution was Frank- Thackeray
superintendent of the San Carlos, In
dian reservation, who investigated the
shooting during the early part of Feb
ruary. Over the objections of the
defense, Thackeray was questioned
regarding a statement made to him
by one of the defendants following
the shooting. Thackeray claimed the
statement was voluntary, and the de
fense charged that it was made only
after Thackeray had given assurance
that it would not he used in the event
the case came to trial.
The final pleas for the defense
were made before the jury yesterday
by Attorney Runke, a brother of Supt
Runke, and Attorney E. S. Clark. The
latter argued the case for two hours,
going over practically every bit of the
evidence and making a strong plea
that the defendants be acquitted on
the grounds of self-defense. The ar
guments lor tne prosecution were
made by United States Attorney
Flynn and Assistant United States
Attorney Langston.
"We have been confident of acquit
tal since the very first," said Robert
son 'last night "We, knew that we
had morally committed no crime and
that wnen the facto were placed be-.
fore the jury that it would be impos-.
sioie lor any but a verdict of not
guilty to follow. We all believe that.
Mr. Clark and the attomevs associat
ed with' him are just about as good as
ern Arizona, those who knew the real
facts in tlie case, have stood by us
since the start"
The climax in the trial came late
yetserday afternoon, when Superin
tendent Runke was arested by United
States Marshal Joe Dillon on a charge
of perjury. Runke was immediately
released on ?2,000 bonds. The charge,
it is said, is the result of a slight dis
repancy in the testimony of Runke re
garding the wording of a letter writ
ten by him to Robertson and the ac
tual wording of the letter. Runke
testified regarding the letter Thurs
day and said he had made a correction
in it His testimony 'regarding the
letter, it is said, differed from the
actual wording of the original and the
corrections. Runke's attorneys last
night declared that the charge was
absurd. Runke will not be tried on
the charge in Prescott, the court hav
ing concluded its September term here
last night Prescott Journal Miner,
September 30.
General satisfaction was expressed
by the people here when the result of
the infamous trial was learned,
though no one believed there could
possibly be any other outcome in a
civilized country.
Had Taddy Tin been a white man
a mere preliminary hearing would
have been all that was necessary to
clear the officers of any charge
against them.
The animus behind the whole af
fair and the strenous effort to be
smirch Supt Runke's name is a mys
tery to most people.
