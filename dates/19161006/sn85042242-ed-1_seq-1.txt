Emperor William Goes to Front
Near Lutsk Austro-Germans
Fall Back
ROUMANIAN ADVANCE
HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED
British Occupy Yenikevi, Near
Struma River On Macedonian
Front
London, Oct. 5.—With the Russians
still vigorously attacking the Austro
Germans in Volhynia, west of Lutsk,
and thence along the whole front to
the Dniester in Galicia, Emperor Wil­
liam has started for the front of Gen­
eral Linsingen near Lutsk, where the
principal fighting is taking place.
At various places in this sector,
and in Galicia, Petrograd asserts that
the Austro-Germans have been defeat­
ed. Berlin, however, takes issue with
the Russian war office statement and
declares that the only points where
the Russians reached the Teutonic
line was north of Zubilno, and that
here they later were driven out-of the
captured positions.
Reports Conflict.
Although there is some divergence
in the official report from Sofia and
Bucharest, concerning the fate of the
force of Roumanians, which was
thrown across the Danube into Bul­
garia, the fact is patent., according
to a Bucharest communication, that
they have ceased their "demonstra­
tion." Bucharest adds that the Rou­
manians withdrew to the left bank
of the Danube, but Sofia asserts that
the battle field in Northern Bulgaria
between Rustchuk and Turtkai, where
they crossed the river, is covered with
Roumanian dead, as 'A result of their
forced speedy retirement back to their
own soil.
Attempts to Advance Frustrated.,
All the attempts of the Roumanians
and Russians to advance in Dobrudja
have been frustrated by counter at­
tacks of the Teutoiric Allies.
Roumanians Make Gains.
In Transylvania, the Roumanians
have captured near Parajd, Austro
German fortifications, after a battle
that lasteid three days. Bekokten,
north of Fogaras, and in the vicinity
of the Hatszeg mountains, the Rou­
manians feere reported by Berlin as
in retreat, but it is admitted by the
German war office that the invaders
have made another gain in the Or
sova sector.
Submarine Sent to Bottom.
A submarine of the Teutonic Allies
was sent to the bottom in the Meddi
terranean, the Cunard liner Franconia
which was being used as a transport
No troops were on the steamer, and
only 12 men of the crew of 302 are
missing.
Forces of the Entente Powers have
driven their lines to within twelve
miles of Monastir, Serbia, and occu­
pied the town of Buf. On the eastern
part of the Macedonian front, the
occupation of Yenikeui, near the Stru­
ma river, by the British is admitted
by Berlin. Likewise, Berlin concedes
the taking by the Entente forces of
Nidje mountain, east of Monastir. The
Italians have captured several addi­
tional towns in Albania.

St. Paul, Minn., Oct. 5.—The elec­
tion of George T. Earl as third vice
president of the Northern Pacific,
which took place at the annual meet­
ing of the directors of the road at
New York today, indicates that the
management of the New York office
will be in his charge and that Jule
M. Hannaford will remain as presi­

which has its principal office in St.
Paul, wit a vice president in New
York, to take care of the business in
the New York offices.
The position of chairman of the
board, left vacant by the death of

Third Journey Into Matrimony
Takes One of Denver Twins tha
Way of the Red Man
Denver, Colo., Oct. 5.—Turning her
back on conventions and racial preju­
dices, Mrs. Adah Dexter Hauk, weal­
thy and noted in Denver as one of
'the Dexter twins, has gone the rpd
man's way as the wife of a Cherokee
Indian.
Mother instinct, friends of Mrs.
Hauk say, prompted her to become
the wife of I. 'Francis Rankin, from
Odena reservation in Wisconsin.
They say she wanted someone to
mother.
Mrs. Hauk was reared in refinement
and luxury. At the defith of her
father she inherited valuable real
estate, jewels and part of his art col­
lection.
Denver reio'ced when she became
the bride of Hale Cronkhite: sorrow­
ed with her first when their baby
died, and again when she secured a
divorce.
Her second marriage, to Ricard
Hauk, a San Francisco musician, also
resulted in divorce.
Mid-life found Mrs. Hauk lonely.
She was preparing for a trip to South
America to lecture, when the Indian
entered her life.
He came to Denver in search of
health. Mrs. Hauk's passion for moth­
ering those in need was stronger than
gossip and the white men's warning
against the lure of the red man.
She became the self-appointed
nurse of the invalid, accompanied him
on health hikes, and induced Rankin
to enter a sanitorium.
When Rankin moved to another
hospital at Colorado Springs Mrs.
Hauk went also.
In Colorado Springs the Indian and
•Mrs. Hauk were married. The iat
tier's sister, Mrs. Parvin, was pros­
trated with grief.
When the snows of winter fly, the
groom of 25 will take his middle-aged
bride to the Indian reservation in
Wisconsin, where they will live the
red man's way.

New York, Oct. 5.—Spurred on
the exhortations of "Mother Jones"
labor agitator, 300 wives, and women
relatives, of striking street car men,
battled with the police late this after­
noon in the most serious riot since
the walkout on the traction lines be­
gan a month ago. Nightsticks were
used by the police, and many of the
women were bruised^ Scores of riot­
ers carried babies in their arms.
The trouble began when the women
poured out of the hall where "Mother"
Jones had exhorted them to "grab the
'scabs' off the cars."
"You are too sentimental," she had
cried, "staying at home thinking of
dress and trinkets, *ften you ought

Dry Candidate Alleges Executive
Favors "Wets" in Stirrm*
Speech
Council Bluffs, la., Oct. 5.—Just
over the Missouri River, where Presi­
dent Wilson was speaking tonight, J.
Frank Hanly, the Prohibition candi­
date for president, charged that the
executive was opposed to state-wide
prohibition.
Hanly's assertion followed receipt
of a communication from Sec. Tumul­
ty in response to a telegram sent
from San Francisco, September 23,
by the Prohibition National campaign­
ers, inquiring if the assertion of the
California "wets" that the President
was against prohibition but favorable
to temperance was true. Tumulty's
reply did not answer this question
directly, but referred the drys to two
letters, regarding the President's at­
titude on the liquor question, written
at different times in the last five
years, in which they interpret he fav­
ored only local option. Request was
made by the drys that the President's
reply be sent by telegraph that they
might use his answer in the Cali­
fornia campaign, but Tumulty's com­
munication was addressed to San
Francisco, returned to Chicago and
finally reached the drys' special at
Parker, S. D., today.
"Here, at last," Hanly said tonight,
"his confession, tardy and indirect,
but confession thru the President's
secretary and over his own signature
that he is in favor of county option
and opposed to state-wide prohibi­
tion."
Trooping into the streets, the wom­
en hooted and jeered at crosstown
cars in 86th Street. Suddenly a chunk
of asphalt was hurled thru the win­
dow of a car halted by a large auto­
mobile truck. This seemed the sig
nal for a general attack on the car,
and in less than a minute every win­
dow) was shattered. A patrolman,
who was on strike duty on the car,
escorted the 40 or 50 passengers into
the street, and then charged alone
into the crowd of jeering women. He
was helpless, however, until assist­
ance arrived.
Meanwhile the car was being wreck­
ed as piece after piece of broken as­
phalt from a pile on the sidewalk
was hurled at it.

AMERICANS KILLED BY
AMERICAN RIFLES
Chicago, Oct. 5.—Senator Beveridge
gave a stirring address here tonight
in support of the Hughes candidacy.
He said, in part:
Credit to Republicans.
"The administration boasts of 'con­
structive laws.' Where did they come
from? Who originated the Currency
Law? A Republican. Who was the
author of the National Child Labor
Law? A Progressive and Republican.
Who proposed and framed the Tariff
Commission Law? The same man
who originated national Child Labor
legislation. Who advanced the idea
of a National Trade Commission? An
eminent American business man—a
Progressive and Republican.
"And during all the long years of
fighting for these reforms Mr. Wil
son and his party frowned upon and
opposed them. Only when the fight
was finished and public opinion so
firmly behind these progressive meaS'
ures that the forces of reaction and
localism dared oppose them no longer,
did dtfr. Wilson change his mind and
force a reluctant and grumbling party
to half-heartedly support them. And
.this was- done at the twelfth hour
under tfie compulsion of terror of the
impending election. How will laws,
so originated and so enacted, be exe'
cuted by a power thus belated and
unfriendly?
No Man Equal to Task.
"No one man is equal to that task.
No individual or group in Mexico can
perform it unless another Dinz should
spring from that blood-soaked soil.
If such an iron dictator should again
appear could he give liberty and per­
manent peace in Mexico? Recent
events answer that question. The
regeneration of Mexico requires the
steady power of a whole nation
schooled in the great truth that or­
der is the first condition of permanent
liberty. It needs the force and pre­
cision of the government of a people
wise, calm, and unafraid of being the
chosen instrument of destiny. That
the inevitable in Mexico has become
the immediate is the result of the ad­
ministration's mishandling of a plain
situation. Now we must free Mexico
from the bondage of anarchy and
from that duty we must not flinch.
"Watchful Waiting."
"There were only two sane courses
to take in Mexico—to go in and re­
store order to the anarch-maddened
creatures of that country or to keep
out and leave them to their mutual
destruction. But the administration
did both and neither. If to safeguard
American lives is a duty, then the
administration fled from that duty, if
to protect American property is an
obligation, the administration repudi­
ated it. It allowed powder and guns
and all the implements of warfare to
pour across the borders, then closed
the embargo on arms, then raised it
again, and closed and raised it once
more.
"Every American citizen and every
American soldier that has been shot
to death was killed with an American
bullet fired from an American rifle.
Murder, arson, lust, rapine, desola­
tion, are the fruits that have ripened
under the policy of watchful waiting.
Wle have not respected Mexican rights
and yet we have not safeguarded Am­
erican rights. And the administra­
tion that permitted this condition to
develop and that is largely responsi­
ble for it, tells us that, it will not lift
a finger to change it. Yet we hear
uncious platitudes about guiding man­
kind aright and laying upon unruly
nations the restraining hand of a su­
perior brotherhood. If we turn our
backs upon the practical duty at our
doors, how can we realize Impracti­
cable idealism in distant lands?
"What answer does the partisan of
the administration make to this long
record of national humiliation abroad
and national abasement at home?
"Wilson Kept Us Out of War."
"Nothing but this campaign catch­
word: 'The administration has kept
us out of war.'
"W:ith whom?
"If we had been in danger of war
during the last three years and the
administration h^d with horcr savel
nr. fro rr.thnt tragedy, that great fact
would have cone far to atone fcr the
