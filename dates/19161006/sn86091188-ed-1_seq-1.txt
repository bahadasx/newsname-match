BARBECUE AND GOVERNORS
FAIR FEATURES AT BOISE
With three governors present—Gov
ernor Ernest Lister of Washington.
Gov, nor James Withy com be of Ore
gon and Governor Moäes Alexander
of Idaho—the Geui State fair of Ida
ho opened with a gigantic barbecue,
at which 6000 people were served
witli as many sandwiches and coffee
at the expense of the citizens and
Fair association, it was the most
successful opening in the history of
the state fair, and the visit of the
governors was a novel event The
purpose of the meeting here of the
governors was to stimulate agricul
ture, horticulture and irrigation in
the northwest.
The governors' party was met at
the fair entrance by the fair officials
and Boise Military hand and escorted
in antomobiles to the scene of the
barbecue, where seven steers roasted.
Barbecue meat and governors vied (or
honors. The chief executives won.
They ate the three first sandwiches
prepared. Then they spoke to their
big audience rrom the automobiles,
After congratulating the fair man
gement. Governor Lister said: '1 am
glad to come into a state that Is even
dryer than Washington. There will
be no returning in Oregon, Idaho or
Washington to the former wet condi
tions. Prohibition in these three
states is here to stay. Washington
this winter expects to l«e a debtless
state. The legislature expects to ap
propriate enough money to pay all
bonded indebtedness. 1 am always
glad to encourage fairs in any states,
and you should he glad to do so In
Idaho. They promote the greatest
of industries, agriculture. "
