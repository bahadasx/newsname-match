hardly more than half a dozen. f

Plans for enlisting the army In a

fill much of the area makai of the
avenue in conjunction with the work
on the mauka side by the territory

by Charles A. Forbes, superintendent
of public works.
Forbes Intends, In addition to this
work, to enlist the harbor commission
in a plan, to dredge much of the water
front along the Ala Moana road, using
the coral and sand thus obtained to
make ' a splendid boulevard that will
run from' the city incinerator as far
Walklki as the John Ena road.- In a
rough estimate made today be said
that the road should cost not more
than 110,000 a mile. ; There will be ap
proximately one and one-half miles of
it to . construct r ":

'I shall request through Gen Evans,

plans, "that the medical staff of the
local department make a report on
the condition of property adjacent to
Kalakaua avenue from a sanitary
standpoint. ? , . . V .
'If the report Sftddes that the place
is unsanitary and If the department

then request the federal government

land on the mauka side which wilt be
Included in-Unit No. 1, Walklki Recla
mation ' Project for which we have
just completed plans and specif ica
tlons." ,- Vi'- ,l v.--V

these plans on the reclamation pro
ject and li said to be favorable to

"I intend to ask the legislature for
the boulevard along the waterfront
and I shall' ask the harbor commis
sion to dredge the harbor In front of
it I also hope to present to the leg
islature a report on the sanitation
fund .and ask that it be Increased so
as to complete several additional
units of the big Walklki scheme,"
Forbes concludes. : L
Persons interested ' in a driveway

In this Vw and the manner in

is hammering it home with tremen

that the country is waking up to
realize that the Adamson bill assault

that they are likely to gain little or
nothing from the law. '. ' .
"The eight-hour law,' so-called. Is a
boomerang for Wilson, says the Ho
nolulu attorney. It strikes at the
root of American Institutions because
it r was legislation put through , Con
gress at the demand of a group of

not an eight-hour law, because the
