.AT.
ERIN TUESDAY MORNING
John G. Weddle, conductor on
the L.,& N. R. R., running from
Bowling Green to Memphis, was
shot by Chas. McElyea, a negro
passenger at Erin last Tuesday
morning. Two shots were fired
through his body. He was tsken
to the Gartley-Ramsay hospital
at Memphis, where hia physician
said that he would recover unless
unforseen developments arise,
The shooting occurred just
after the train left Erin. McEl
yea had a ticket to Erin, and
failing to get off there, Weddle
told him he would have to get off
at the next station, and turned
to walk up the aisle. The negro
drew a pistol and aimed it at
Weddle's back, but Jim Boyd,
negro Porter seized his arm and
interrupted his aim. The bullet
struck the conductor in the arm.
Weddle and Boyd attempted
to wrest the weapon from the
negro, and in the midst of the
struggle he fired again, the bullet
entering Wheddle's right side.
Two more shots were fired but
both went wide.
McElyea was arrested and
lodged in jail here. A quantity
of whiskey was found in his
suitcase.
Weddle has been , in the ser
vice of the L. & N. for 38 years,
but has been on this division for
only three years. ;
Sheriff Roby, of Erin, came to
Paris Tuesday and carried McEl
yea back to Erin, where he was
lodged in jail. .

5-year subscriptions this week

votes, and so on. Get the long
