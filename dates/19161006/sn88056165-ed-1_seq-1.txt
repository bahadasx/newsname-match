COTTONWOOD'S FIRST FAIR
PROVES A DIG SUCCESS
Late Season and Adverse Weather Fail to Darken Fair Days
and Exhibits Create Much Favorable Comment. Next
Year's Fair be Far Superior.
Cottonwood's first annual fair
and stock show will draw to a
close this evening and in spite of
the backward harvest season and
adverse weather conditions for
several days prior to the opening
of the fair the concensus of
opinion is that the fair has been
a real success in every way and
that our town has full reason to
feel proud of what it has accom
plished in this, its first effort.
The fair opened Wednesday
morning with cold, cloudy
weather and indications of rain
but this did not dampen the en
thusiasm of the citizens and
fair visitors and by the time the
big parade was .ready at 11
o'clock the town was nicely
filled with sightseers from the
the surrounding country and
neighboring towns. Promptly at
11 o'clock the parade assembled
on east Main street and passed
up Main street, thence up King
street to the Catholic church,
thence west to School street,
thence back to Main street where
it disbanded. The parade was
led by the Kamiah band in full
Indian costume, after which came
the high school students, autos
containing the governing board
of the commercial club and the
village council, decorated auto
mobiles, farm autos, business and
farm floats and fine animals from
the live stock exhibits. The par
ade was over half a mile in
length and was one of the finest
ever seen in the upper country.
After the parade the crowd
congregated at the barbecue
grounds where fully 1500 people
were served with generous allow
ances of fine; juicy roast beef
that had been prepared for the
occasion.
In the afternoon small sports
were pulled off on Main street
and the fair visitors made the
rounds of various exhibits and
enjoyed themselves until evening
when the movies and bowery
dance claimed their attention.
On Thursday the weather
showed a decided improvement
and the sun came out bright and
warm throughout the day. Music
by the band filled the morning
hours and at 11 o'clock the
special train pulled in from Lew
iston with fully one hundred en
thusiastic boosters, who were
met at the station by the band
and citizens and escorted into
town, where the live stock judg
ing was in progress.
In the afternoon wild west
i tunts and auto contests were in
order at the ball park and were
followed by a band concert on the
street in the evening and the
picture show and dance.
This afternoon more stunts are
in progress at the ball park and
the sale of live stock is being
held at the barns on Main street,
Auctioneer Harry C. Cranke, of
Spokane, being in charge of the
sales.
The cold, stormy weather be
fore the fair opened and the
threatening weather on the open
ing day, together with the fact
that many of the farmers are
still occupied with harvest opera
tions, cut short the exhibits ma
terially yet the showing in all
departments were very credit
able and elicited many words of
commendation.
While the horses were not as
many as should have been they
put up a very; classy appearance,
the Luchtefeld showing of black
Percherons being especially
worthy of mention.
In the cattle division the
a
of
to
Schroeder Herefords were the
center of attraction. The dairy
divsion was particulary short of
animals but this can be greatly
improved in another year.
The hog deparment was also
short on exhibits but the Poland
China herds of Howard McKin
ley and John Funke showed some
classy stuff and the judge was
sorely puzzeled i n awarding
prizes between these herds.
Most of the awards in the
sheep division went to W. H.
Zumwalt, of Grangeville, who
had several fine animals on ex
hibition.
In the agricultural and horti
cultural department the exhibits
were not numerous but showed
up very nicely for an off year,
the Salmon river section partic
ularly producing some attractive
collections.
It lay with the ladies exhibi
tion of fancy work, however, to
eclipse all departments in both
the number of exhibits and the
quality of articles shown. In
fact, the large building was filled
to overflowing with fine art ex
hibits and many stated that even
the Lewiston-Clarkston fair did
not put up a finer exhibition of
this class than was shown here.
While the fair crowd probably
did not exceed 1500 to 2000
people any day, all seemed pleas
ed with the entertainment pro
vided and the business men gen
erally are pleased with the re
sults of their first attempt and
will undoubtedly make the fair
an annual event.
Below we give as many of the
premium winners as we have
been able to secure:
Beef Cattle
In the Hereford class August
Schroeder, of Cottonwood, took
all awards except second prize
on yearling bull, which went to
M. L. Hastings of Kamiah.
In the Shorthorn class Riley
Rice won all prizes except on
best dual purpose cow, which
award was secured by A. O.
Martin.
In the dairy department John
Meyer won first on best grade
Holstein heifer. Roy Huff first on
yearling bull, and Fred and Cecil
Wimer first on best grade calf.
John Funke won first prize on
best Jersey grade cow over three
years of age, second prize going
to B. L. Hussman. On Jerseys
under two years of age, both
awards went to cattle exhibited
by St. Gertrude's convent.
Draft Horses
In the draft horse department
the grand championship was won
by the Clydesdale stallion owned
by Mat Pederson, of Keuterville.
Second prize went to Barney
Luchtefeld 's black, and third to
the gray horse of the Cottonwood
Horse Co., both of the latter
animals being of the Percheron
breed. The prize for the best
mare of all breeds went to Wren
& Greenough of Denver, second
and third awards going to B.
Lutchefeld, of Keuterville. The
former won on the best two year
old, with Luchtefeld second.
Wren & Greenough won on best
suckling colt. Luchtefeld won
first on best grade mare and best
grade mare and colt, with St.
Gertrude's convent second on the
last entry. Chas. Olson won
first on draft team, with O. D.
Hamlin second. Riley Rice won
first on best grade two year old.
There were 35 horses on ex
hibition in the horse department

Another Pioneer Passes Away.
One by one the pioneers of the
first days, who braved the dang
ers and endured the hardships
incident to the opening up of
this vast country, are answering
the last roll call.
Seth Jones, who was one of
the first pioneers of Idaho county,
was born in Allegany county,
New York, on April 6, 1833, and
died Sunday, October 1, 1916, at
5 o'clock p. m. at the age of 83
years, 5 months and 25 days, and
before passing he called all the
childred excepting Seth and Bob
who are in California, to his bed
side to bid them a last farewell,
and on missing Sam he directed
his sons to call him at once or he
would be too late. His wishes
were complied with and Sam
reached the bedside in time to
bid his father goodbye. The
neighbors and oldtime friends
were also called in at his request
and all were asked not to grieve
for him. Mr. Jones also asked
to have Mrs. Aram, who resides
in this city, brought to his bed
side, that he might have a last
talk with one of the first neigh
bors the Jones family had on
coming to Camas Prairie. Mrs.
Aram is past 83 years of age.
In the year 1853 on the 3d day
of April, he started across the
plains, reaching Portland on Aug
ust 19 and wintered at Jackson
ville; thence to Siskiyou county
where he mined for four years,
and then returned to Illinois
where he was married on Decem
ber 13, 1858, to Miss Jane E.
Castle. Two years later this
worthy couple started across the
plains again. On this' trip all of
their horses were stolen by the
Indians and they bad to.pay the
sum of twelve dollars per dfcy to
have their wagons pulled to their
destination.
After remaining in California
for two years, they came to Idaho,
reaching Florence in 1862, where
they lived until the following year
when they took up the first ranch
settled on Camas Prairie. He
went to general farming and
stock-raising and met with suc
cess on every turn.
Mr. Jones was of a kind, loyal,
generous disposition and no way
farers ever passed his door with
out being invited to partake of
his hospitality and no dumb
brutes were ever allowed to go
hungry.
During the Indian war of 1877
he refused to sign the petition to
have the Indians set onto the
Reservation, therefore was un
molestèd by them.
On May 12, 1906, Mr. Jones
was called upon to mourn the
I death of his wife, Mrs. Jane
I Jones.
To this union were born the
following named children: Asa,
Ella, (deceasod), Belle, Samuel,
Seth, Rhoda, Robert, William,
and Jennie Martin, adopted.
Belle being the first white child
born on Camas Prairie.
On September 10, 1908, he was
again united in marriage to
Mrs. Evaline York Jones.
On February 6, 1909, he suffer
ed a paralytic stroke as the re
sult of an accident by being
thrown from a buggy, and has
been an invalid and at times,
helpless, since that time.
He has been faithfully cared
for by his wife, who, with the
children, are left to mourn his
loss. Also twenty grand-child
ren and twelve great-grand
children.
Funeral services were held at
the residence Wednesday after
noon at 2 o'clock. Rev. Walter
Callison, of the Christian church
officiating, and interment was
made at Prairieview cemetery,
friends of the family from all
over the county following the
remains to their last resting.
The pall bearers were W. W.
The Kamiah Indian Band.
The Kamiah Indian band,
which has been furnishing sweet
est music for our fair and stock
show for the past three days, in
vaded the Chronicle affice yester
day morning and took the place
by storm. They trod on the tail
of the office cat, mixed up a "pi"
in the "hell box," knocked down
the office towel and shattered it
into a million pieces, and almost
laid affectionate hands o n t h e
shoulder of the office devil. To
top out things, the savage with
the big bass horn tried his best
to blow a hole through the
office roof, but fortunately failed
in his effort.
All jokes aside, however, the
band is a dandy organization and
one of which our neighboring
city on the river can well feel
proud. The boys put up as fine
a band of music as one could
wish and are willing to play
as frequently as required. The
members are all real gentlemen
and will be welcomed in Cotton
wood at any time, whether in
uniform or as private citizens.
They were well worth the price
paid for their services. Come
again, boys.
Mexican Shot Idaho Captain
Boise, Idaho, Oct. 1—A special
dispatch to the Idaho Statesman
from Nogales, Ariz., says that
Captain H. W. Wilson, second
Idaho medical corps, was dan
gerously shot in the left thigh
Sunday afternoon in the railroad
station at Nogales, Ariz , by a
Mexican soldier who fired from a
position in front of the Bank of
Senora, on the Mexican side of
the Mexican side of the interna
tional boundary.
Captain Wilson had just
checked his trunk for Twin Falls,
Idaho, his home, where he was
going on a 30-day furlough, the
dispatch added, r -
The guard on the border was
immediately increased, sentries
being stationed 50 feet apart.
Army officers said it is the first
case during the present border
trouble of an American officer
being shot on American soil by
an assailant from the Mexican
side.
Captain Wilson's wound is not
serious.
The Mexican version of the
affair is that a soldier shot at an
escaping prisoner and the bullet
struck Wilson. The prisoner
was later recaptured and
executed.

On account of extra work in
cident to the fair we are a day
late with this issue of the paper.
Such occasions are rare and can
not always be avoided.

Herald, and Geo. A. Smith, of
the Grangeville Globe, were
pleasant callers at this office
while seeing the fair today.
Quite a large delegation of
Grangeville people were in town

spoke very highly of the various
exhibits and the entertainment
features.

The application of the prosecu
tion for a change of venue in the
Herman J. Rossi trial at Wallace

Rossi's wide acquaintance and
influence in his county.
John McPherson, the Grange

Would Improve the
Old State Road
Ih response to a propostion on
the part of the state highway
commission to furnish the re
quired number of convicts to im
prove the old state road up the
Salmon river from Whitebird to
the county line beyond Pollock
this fall, provided Idaho county
will supply $250 to buy the neces
sary grub for the men, the Com
mercial club Wednesday passed
resolutions recomending that the
cooperative steps be taken. The
communication states that Re
publican State Chairman Evan
Evans, who recently made the
trip over the state road in an
auto, appeared before the com
mission and presented to them
the urgent need of such improve
ment, stating that in his judg
ment the cost of putting this im
portant highway in reasonably
fair condition for auto travel
would be of small moment com
pared with the benefits to be
gained thereby. Boulders will
have to be blown out at a number
of places, rocks removed
at other points, high centers ta
ken out and sharp angles on cer
tainly meet with the approval of
the Salmon river citizens and
would materially assist in the
construction work on the perma
nent north and south highway.-*
