ed by C. H. Cameron, its president,
filed suit late yesterday In the district
court here, throng!' its attorneys, Judge
J. T. Diekerson of Oklahoma City, and
Riddle & Hammerly, against the Prai
rie Oil & Gas company, for damages
in the sum of $500,000.00 actual dam
ages, and 1250,000.00 exemplary dam
ages. It Is said that C. II. Cameron, who
Js the organizer and president of the
company, learned the oil business In
the east, and that he had had about
thirty years' experience and is looked
upon as both a scientific and a prac
tical oil man. After coming to this
state about five years ago, he studied
the conditions and tho geological re
ports of the government for about two
years, and finally decided that there
was a large pool of oil near Paden, Ok
lahoma, where was drilled what is
usually referred to as the "Mysterious
Paden Well." There has been much
leasing, and other test wells are being
drilled in this section of lie country.
After Mr. Cameron hrd reached the
'conclusion that oil existed at this
point, after conferring with the offi
cers of the Prairie Oil & Gas company,
they were-convinced that his conclu
sion was well founded, and entered
Into a drilling contract to develop
this section of the country. In the
petition filed In court, it is substantial.
Jy alleged: ,,
That the plaintiff was the owner of
obout two thousand (20O0) acres of oil
and gas leases situated near Paden,
Oklahoma, which it was desirous of
having drilled and developed for oil
and gas and entered into a drilling
and development contract with the de
fendant, the Prairie Oil & Gas compa
ny, whereby the said defendant com
pany agreed to drill a test well upon
the property and in the event that oil
br gas was found in paying quantities,
defendant company was to continue to
jilrill and develop tho property and the
Paden Oil company was to have an
Undivided one-halt interest in and to
oil or gas, or the proceeds thereof, af-

The plaintiff avers that the defend

found oil in paying quantities, and
that tho well, if it had been properly
drilled and finished, would have pro
duced at least five hundred (500) bar
rels per day of high grade oil.
Charge Killing of Well.
That said company wilfully and un
lawfully for the purpose of injuring
i) aintiff. and with a view or tinauy
tlerrauding plaintitf out of said prop
erty, killed said well by refusing and
neglecting to properly drill the same
in the proper manner and by putting
certain material and substance in said
well consisting of cement, water and
pther material, and then plugg'ng and
$ealing tho same with the view of pre
senting said well from flowing oil and

the purpose of defrauding said plain
tiff out of said property has wrongful
ly, wilfully and unlawfully conspired,
connived against the plaintiff compa
ny and against C. H. Cameron, the
president of plaintiff company, with
the view of forcing said plaintiff to
sell said property or abandon the
same, and with the further view of
trying to get control of the majority
of stock of said plaintiff company, in
order to control Baid company and to
defraud plaintiff and its officers and
stockholders out of said property.
That in carrying out said conspiracy,
said defendant company, in connection
with said parties, has caused certain
false statements to be published and
circulated regarding tho well herein
above referred to, and the field in and
around Paden, and said defendant
company, through its servants, agents
and employes, has published certain
false statements in substance to the
effect that said well did not and would
not produce oil in paying quantities,
and otherwise circulating and publish
ing false statements regarding said
property, for the purpose of depreciat
ing the value of the stock in said
plaintiff company, with the view of ob
taining the majority of the stock in
said company, for the purposes here
inabove alleged.

$500,00 and for attempting to wreck

trol of the same and in maliciously

and W. C. Harwell, who made 8J.
Mr. Hurd was a contestant in a re
cent national amateur championship
tournament but had hard luck on a
strange course and was eliminated
early in the contest. He compliment
ed the Chickasha club on its excellent
course. However, he had been accus
tomed to playing on grass "greens"
and the sand "greens" of the local
links were too fast for him and hence
he was unable to make his usual score.
Mr. Hurd is a cotton man and was
here on business.

In splendid trim and awaiting the

today announced themselves as being
ready to meet their opponents on this

Though the game with the Enid

About two hundred pupils repre

to spectators. Forming at tho Carne

FAIR BONDS
All Farmers and Others Interested are
Told to Meet With County Commis
sioners Monday
One of the most interesting of re
cent sessions of the county commis
sioners is promised next Monday when
a large number of farmers and others
interested in the proposed issue of
$00,000 permanent fair bonds will ap
pear before that body to press their
claims of Grady county boing able
and far enough advanced to have a
permanent fair and permanent fair
buildings.
W. K. Smith, of the Union Hill farm,
speaking for himself as a farmer and
exhibitor and also for other, farmers,
urges all those who are interested in
tho proposition to bo on hand on Mon
day ready to take a hand in tho dis
cussion or to lend their moral support
to tho movement.
"The question is whether we will let
our county take a back step. The far
mers believe they are entitled to a
permanent fair and to proper accom
modations when they attend tho an
nual fair.
"Those who did not attend tho state
fair cannot understand how near Gra
ly county came to winning first prize
in county exhibits. The decision was
held in tho balance for a whole day
with less than one per cent difference
between Chickasha and the winner,
but at length, in some manner, we
landed only sixth place in the wind
up. However, that does not alter the
fact that we had a magnificent display
and it emphasizes the fact that annual
fairs in Grady county can be made a
big success. Let everyone who is in
terested in the matter be on hand on
Monday."
The Grady County Medical associa
tion will meet tonight in the mayor's
office at the city hail.

Berlin, Oct. 6. Several leaders of
the Von Tirpitz faction who are ad
vocating the resumption of submarine
warfare have suggested the submarine
blockade of 'certain English harbors
as a compromise measure. It is urg
