McPherrin Tells How He
Captured a live Coyote

Malta. Raoada has aold, to A. W.

18', town of MallB.
W. E. McPherrin has a full growu
live coyote aa a pet. Ot course, he
doesn't pet it a great deal, but he
calls it a pet.
The coyote was trapped on the P, T,
Games place near Wilson bridge a few
daya ago by a front foot. The foot
Mil heal up.
The other night the pet got loose In
the J. S. Mills ft Son Implement
house, where McPherrin works, and
for some time had possession of, the
place. It was no child'! play to catch
a full grown coyote loose among
wagons, barrows, binders and plows.
Although It is reliably reported that
the coyote was trapped, and although
an Injured foot proves this, here ls
the story McPherrin tells about catch
ing his pet:
"I saw, the coyote in a stubble field
aud started after It. Before long I
had caught up with it and made a.
grab for Its tall. My band slipped,
but again I atarted for the brute.
Next time I got a more secure hold,
and after swinging the coyote around,
grabbed Mt by the neck and held it
fast until I could get a rope out of gey
pocket to tie around lta neck."
