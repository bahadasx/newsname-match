The police declared they had evi

the supposed conspiracy, but refrained
from bringing such a charge against
them, until others are arrested.

CZAR'S APPOINTMENT
MYSTIFIES GERMANY
Teutons Surprised by His Raising
Protopopoff to Cabinet Rank
Made Minister of Interior.
Berlin, Oct. 6.—The appointment of
M. Protopopoff, the second vice pres
ident of the duma, as minister of the
interior, was a great surprise to Ger
man political observers, who regard
it as the most puzzling of recent Rus
sian ministerial changes.
Well-informed people in Berlin be
lieve that Premier Stuermer's opin
ion was not asked when this appoint
ment was decided upon, but that it
had its origin among the intriguers
surrounding the ocarina at Tsarskie
Selo.
The Tageblatt recalls the fact that
Protopopoff is the fifth Russian min
ister of the interior within barely ten
months. "It would be altogether
wrong to think that his appointment
is due to his being a member of the
duma," says the Tageblatt. Stuermer's
is and remains a reactionary bureau
cratic cabinet, which will not be
swayed by any one member of differ
ent sympathies. Protopopoff was
comparatively unknown in Germany
until with another member of the
duma he made a trip through the en
tente countries. It was said on his
return he expressed himself not very
favorably Impressed with what he
saw in France, but still less so with
what he saw in England. On his way
home he is said to have met certain
German personalities in Stockholm,
with whom he seems to have had long
conversations, as a result of which
he made it quite clear in Petrograd
that Germany could not possibly be
starved out. Then, to the great as
tonishment of Petrograd society, he
was commanded to appear before the
czar at Grand Headquarters—an hon
or which had never before been ac
corded to a mere member of the
duma.

With the British Armies in France.
Oct. 6—Never were such numbers of
aeroplanes employed and never did
they play such an important part as
in the battle of the Somme.
The wastage of British aeroplanes at
the front has been supplied by new
machines flown across the Channel
from England, where, after coming
from the factory, they are tested out
at a home aerodrome. The record
time in crossing the Channel at the
narrowest point, where the distance is
twenty-two miles, is eight minutes.
When the Associated Press Corre
spondent, who was in London for a
day's leave from the front, asked a
certain general at the war office for
permission to fly back, the answer
was: ''Perfectly easy."
"What about my baggage?" asked
the correspondent.
"Oh, take it along and strap it on,"
replied the general. "An aeroplane
that carries 160 pounds of bombs will
not be bothered with a dress suit
case."
A dozen machines, one after an
other, were due to go to-France that

LOW GRADE
WHEAT GOOD
fORMHJJNG
Expert Opinion Given by
President Ladd of
Importance.
TESTS AT A. C. MILL
AND IN THE BAKERY
Rejected Grade Showed 66.4
Per Cent of Flour and
Made Fine Bread.
Fargo, N. D., Oct. 6.—Low grade
wheats of this year, which have been
proclaimed by milling interests of the
northwest to be unfit for milling pur
poses, have been milled into high
grade flours at the North Dakota Ag
ricultural college experimental flour
ing mill, according to announcement
en'E-
F. Ladd.
Within a short time, or as soon as
his Investigations have continued to
a point where it is absolutely certain
that this year's low grade wheats are
valuable for milling purposes, Presi
dent Ladd will issue a bulletin set
ting forth the whole situation-
President Ladd lias established the
fact that this year's low grade wheat
is of high milling value through the
tests conducted at the experimental
mill, and in the bakery at the A. C.,
where the flour has i*en converted
into high class bread.
Ijow
Price Propaganda is Charged,
That the price of the low grade
wheats is being constantly kept down
through a propaganda by which it is
made to appear that the northwestern
wheat, production is valueless for
milling purposes, and that the millers
must purchase their grain elsewhere,
is the charge made by the producing
interests of this state, represented by
the Society of Equity and the Non
partisan league.
Tests so far conducted have indi
cated that wheat grading from No. 2
down to rejected, and weighing as low
as 34 pounds, have been converted
into good flour, which flour produces
a bread above the standard used by
millers and bakers.
From Pembina county a sample of
hard spring wheat was submitted to
the experiment mill which took the
rejected grade, weighing 46 pounds
a bushel before cleaning, and 50
pounds a bushel after cleaning. Fig
uring out the 5.45 pounds in clean
ing. and .093 per cent in milling, this
flour produced 66.4 per cent of flour.
Wheat is^ considered doing well if
it produces
*68...per
cent of flour, al
though much wheat produces more
than that percentage, and many sam
ples of poor looking 19X6 wheat has
milled higher.
This sample of Pembina county
wheat, in addition to the flour, pro
duced 17.7 per cent of bran. at»d 17.46
per cent of shorts, in addition to the
66.4 per cent flour.
Made Very Fine Bread.
Bread made from the flour was very
fine, with a 2,590 cubic centimeters
volume, as against a 2,200 standard
volume.
In color, it scored 92 per cent, while
88 per cent is considered standard.
As to texture, it was 97 per cent, 11
points above standard.
Based on these facts, the bushel
of wheat in question was actually
worth, in finished product, the sum
of $1.75 1-2. Figuring 30 cents a
bushel as the cost of milling, the value
of the wheat at the time of market
ing should have been $1.47 1-2, while
the wheat was actually listed on the
market at the time at only $1.18 1-2
a bushel, leaving a difference of 29
cents, pointed to by the producing
interests as clear velvet for the mill
ers, a profit which should have ac
crued to them, instead of to the mill
ing interests, providing the grading of
grain was on the milling value basis.
A No. 4 wheat, milled at the A. C.
produced like results. It netted 63.0.3
per cent flour its bread loaf volume
was 2,400 the bread color was 92,
and texture 93. all high above the
limit. This wheat was worth, when
milled, $1.80 a bushel, and deducting
the 30 cents milling cost, its value
to the
Droducer
should have been
$1.50, when, as a matter of fact, he
received only $1.39 1-8.
President Ladd's bulletin detailing
the whole question of milling values
probably will be off the presses about
the first of December.

London, Oct. 6.—The surprise
sprung upon Bulgaria and her Teu
tonic allies by the Rumanian cross
ing of the Danube between Rust
chuk and Tutrakan is hailed here as
a stroke of such daring character
that it would not have been attempted
except in strong force. It is regarded
as a distinct threat to Mackensen's
communications through the difficult
Dobrudja swamps, where there are no
railroads and few roads, and if, as Is
believed here, the Rumanian invasion
of Bulgaria is in strength and if it is
pushed successfully, the famous Ger
man "thruster" will be forced to make
an extremely difficult retirement or
sacrifice the bulk of his army.
Mackensen's advance in Dobrudja.
which the kaiser hailed as a decisive
victory, already is described by some
experts here as a Pyrrhic, triumph.
He failed to gain the railway bridge
that spans the Danube at "ernavoda
before the relatively slow concentra
tion of the Russian forces for the
assistance of the Rumanians in this
district was completed, and when it
was completed Mackensen was driven
ten miles south.
No doubt is expressed here- that
preparations have been going on for
an offensive move against Mackensen
by the Russian and Rumanian force
which has held the Danube bridge
head during the recent period of ap
parent stagnation. It takes time to
assemble an army which depends for
its transport on a bridge carrying a
single line of railroad. Equally no
doubt is entertained that the Ru-

Speaking further on the possibility

"Its attempted enforcement would
be a scandal, which would ring round
