BULGARIANS IET
DEFEAT NEAR
boms t
Allies Taka Two Villages South
east of City
VON 1INSINGEN HARD PRESSED
City
of Lutsk Has Become Center of
Activity in Province of
Volhynia.
London, Oc;t. 6. The allied armies
have defeated the Bulgarian forces
southwest of Monastir, according to
a dispatch received by the war office
The French and Russians have taken
the villages of Buf and Poplin Bouth
west of Monastir.
A dispatch from Salonikl says that
the Bulgarians on tho Struma front
have been forced to retreat. Furious
fighting Is in progress on tho right
wing according to the statement
of Gen. Garrail.
With the Russians still vigorously
attacking the Austro-Ccrmans in Vol
hynia, west of Lutsk and thence along
the whole front to the Dniester in
Galicia, Emperor William has started
for the fiont of Gen von Linsingeu
near Lutsk, where the principal fight
ing Is taking place.
At various places in this sector and
in Galicia. I'etrograd asserts that the
AustroGermans have been defeated.
lierlin, however, declares that the on
ly point where the Russians reached
the Teutonic lines was north of Zubit
no and that there they later were
driven out of the( captured positions.
Although there is some divergence
in the official reports from Sofia and
Bucharest concerning tne fate of the
force of Rumanians which was thrown
across the Danube into Bulgaria, the
fact is patent, according to a Buchar
est communication, that they have
ceased their "demonstration." Buch
arest adds that the Rumanians with
drew to the, left bank of tho Danube,
but Sofia asserts that the battlefield
in northern Bulgaria between Rusl
chuk and Turtukal, where they
crossed the river, is covered with Ru
manian dead as a result of their forc
ed speedy retirement back to their
own soil.
All attempts of the Rumanians and
Russians to advance in Dobrudja have
been frustrated by counter-attacks of
the Teutonic allies. Thirteen cannon
have fallen into the hands of the
Russians and Rumanians in this
region.
In Transylvania tho Rumanians
have captured, near I'arajd, Austro
German fortifications, after a battle
that lasted throe days. Near Bekok
ten, north of Fogaras and I nthe vici
nity of the Hatszeg mountains the Ru
manians are reported by Berlin as In
retreat, but it is admitted by the Ger
man war office that the Invaders have
made another gain in the Orsova sec
tion. Forces of the entente powers have
driven their line to within 12 miles
of Monastir, Servia, and occupied the
town of Buf. On the eastern part of
the Macedonian front the occupation
of Yenikeui, near the Struma river,
by the British is admitted by Berlin.
Likewise, Berlin concedes the taking
by the entente forces of Nidje moun
tain, east of Monastir. The Italians
have captured several additional
towns In Albania.
Considerable fighting has again
taken place In Asiatic Turkey, where
along the coastal region Russian land
forces, in co-operation with their fleet
have made advances on a wide front,
inflicting heavy losses on1 the Turks
and capturing arms, ammunition and
supplies, says Petrograd. Constanti
nople reports the repulse of the Brit
ish In an attempt to advance aloiis
the Euphrates front, near Nasiriyeh.

LIBELSUII
Jeremiah O'Leary Wants to Know
if hyphenism is libelous
O'LEARY ASSERfS LOYALTY
Litigation Crows Out of Plaintiff's
Recent Message to President
Wilson.
New York, Oct. (i. Vance C. Me
Connick, chairman of the democratic
national committee, announced late
yesterday thut he had been served
with n summons in a suit for $.10,000
brought against him by Jeremiah A.
O'Leary, president of the "Atmvrican
truth society." Mr. McCormack said
he had not been apprised, however, of
the charges upon which the suit was
based. Mr. O'Leary, in a statement
Issued soon afterward, declared that
his purpose in instituting the action
was "to find out first, whether hyph
enism, so called, is libellous, and sec
ond, whether it is inconsistent with
Americanism."
Mr. O'Leary said ho rescented a
statement attributed to Mr. MeCor
mick, criticizing him for sending an
"insulting message" to President Wil
son, in that message Mr. O' Leary crit
related tile president for "not enforc
ing American rights against Great
Biitaiu" and iniormed Mr. Wilson
that he would not vote for the re
election of the president. Mr. Wilson
said that he would "feel deeply morti
fied to have you (O'Leary) or any
body like you vote for me," adding,
"since you have access to many dis
loyal Americans and I have not, 1 will
ask you to convey this message to
them."
in the statement attributed to Mr.
McConnick appearing Wednesday an 1
upon which Mr. O'Leary said ho based
his suit for libel, the chairman of the
democratic national committee was
quoted as having commented upon the
presence of Charles E. Hughes at the
Union League club reception Tuesday
night, concluding with the statement
that there could be no doubt about
Mr. Hughes' position because of his si
lence on the message cent to the pres
ident by Mr. O'Leary.
Mr. O'Leary gave out last night the
following: "My purpose, in suing Mr.
McCormick is to find cut, first, wheth
er hyphenisni o called is libellous,
and second, whether it is in consistent
with Americanism. I also sue him as
a challenge to him to let an American
jury decide whether a protest to the
president because he has no tenforced
American rights against Great Britain
is disloyalty. 1 also resent the hid
eous imputation contained in his
statement that any man running for
a public office could repudiate my
vote, or the votes of millions of my
fellow-citizens who think as I do. A
citizen's loyalty to his country is not
a proper part of u political campaign,
and therefore 1 feel that it is wrong
to assert it politically because it.
strikes at the fundamentals of our
citizenship.
"What righ would Charles E.
Hughes have to repudiate me? What
light lias be to repudiate any voter
who would vote for hint? 1 yield to
Mr. McCormick his right to support
Mr. Wilson and to vote for Mr. Wilson
and no matter bow faithless 1 believe
Mr. Wilfon has been in protecting
American lives, property and com
meico, I would never assert that he
was disloyaj because he, supported
Mr. Wilson and differed from Mrv
Hughes."
John It. Jones, counsel for Mr.
O'Leary. declared that Mr. O'Leary
"also Intends to begin other libel suits
against newspapers throughout ' the
country which have questioned his
right and abused him for sending
what he considered to be a perfectly
proper telegram to the president of
tho United States."

VERMONT POSTMASTERS FINED
Used.Uj S. Funds and Placed Money
. ' In Wrong Cash Drawer.
: Rutland, Oct. 5. During tho noon
recess of the United States district
court today Judge Harland B. Ilowo
of St. Johnsbury disposed of three
criminal cases in which the respond
ents were ready to plead guilty. A.
J. Hubbard of Tyson was'fined $50 for
opening a letter not addressed to him
and Sylvester Smith, postmaster at
Hubbardton, was fined $50 and L. 11.
Spaulding, Brldgewater, postmaster,
was taxed $25 for technical embezzle
ment of postoilice funds.
The offense against the postmast
ers was misplacing postoilice money.
In tho case the respondent used a
small amount temporarily as; a mat
ter of convenience in his mercantile
business, when he possessed an ample
amount to make the sum taken good
and in the other the accused merely
placed the money in the wrong re
ceptacle. The shortage was very
small In Mr. Smith's case and there
was none In the case of the Bridge
water man. Judge Howe expressed
the opinion that there should not be
a law making such a technical offense
punishable by a fine.
The time In court today was taken
up with the testimony in the negli
gence case against the National Metal
Box Edge company of Readsboro in
which LIvlo Francheseliotti's adminis
trator seeks to recover lor the death
of Livio, a boy of five, by drowning
In the defendant's canal. The plain
tiff contends that the canal was not
properly guarded. The defense claims
trepass and declares that it was not
bound by law to put up a guard rail
the entire length of a canal.
Judge Howe has not given a decis
ion on the petition of Vermont stock
holders for a co-receiver for the Bos
ton & Maine railroad. He has intimat
ed that In lieu of such an officer he
will designate an attorney to look af
ter the interests of Vennonters In all
proceedings of the road.

COMPANY TO FIGHT
SieiKifiGCilii
mi
Determined to Exhaust Treasury of
Amalgamated Association
HOPES OF SETTLEMENT GONE
Union Leader Says There Are No Ne
gotiations in Progress at
: Present.
New York, Oct. 6. The dove of
peace, which for days seemed to be
hovering over the traction situation,
took wings yesterday for a prolonged
flight. It was evident from state
ments made by James L. Quacken
bush, speaking for the Interborough
and New York Railways Company,
and Frederick W. Whitridge for the
Third Avenue that they will continue
their fight until they have exhausted
the Amalgamated Association of
Inoney and men.
Complete discouragement was given
to the efforts of Samuel Gompers to
act as adjuster. (Juackenbush said
t he companies will not entertain any
suggestion he can offer for a peaceful
settlement. Whitridge reaffirmed his
determination to refuse employment
on his lines to all members of the
Amalgamated.
This adamantine opposition was a
setback to the strikers. They had
been led to believe in the last few
days that there was a prospect of
yielding by the traction heads. After
the announcements of Quackenbush
and Whitridge they braced them
selves for a continuance of the fight.
With the fourth week of the strug
gle coming to an end the Amalgamat
ed finds itself facing two trying situ
ations. The first Is the necessity for
paying out another $50,000 in strike
lunds to the men who quit work. This
payment come due today. The second
is in" the fact that at least SOU men
have deserted the union to go back to
car work. Two- hundred of these
have gone back to the "green car"
lines and 311 have returned to the
Third Avenue.
William B. Fitzgerald, the strike
leader, in addressing Columbia Uni
versity students yesterday said bis
organization has been receiving large
sums of money from sources outside
organized labor. Grocers also have
been making donations of food for the
strikers, Fitzgerald said. There is no
actual suffering among his men, he
declared, and there have been no
evictions. He said earlier in the day
that he has no negotiations under
way with a view of ending the strike.
"Is it possible Mr. Gompers Is con
ducting settlement negotiations over
your head?" he was asked.
"If by the words 'over your head'
you mean against my will, I can say
no. I am perlectly willing that any
man or woman in tho world shall set
tle the strike if he or she can."

FANS SCRAMBLED
FOR TICKETS TO
WORLD'SSERIES
icants at Fenway Park Resem
ble Bleacher Crowd
SALE UNDER NEW SYSTEM
More Disappointed Applicants Than in
Any Previous Year of Baseball
Classic.
Boston, Oct. ti. Seekers of reserved
seats took on the appearance of
bleacher crowds yesterday in -the
scramble for reservations for the
world's series baseball games, which
begins there tomorrow. They swarmed
about the ticket offices at Fenway
park in lines broken often by the
eagerness of some enthusiast to ob
tain earlier possession of tickets.
Women and staid business men vied
with messenger boys and others in
their effort to gain prominent places
in the line. No actual disorder de
veloped, but the police were called
upon to reform lines, and club em
ployes endeavored, unsuccessfully, to
placate disappointed applicants who
clamored for answers to their written
requests for seats.
The rtish for reservations was a re
sult of a new system, made neces
sary this year, President J. J. Lannln
of the Boston Americans explained,
because of the late date upon which
the American league race was decided
By this system successful applicants
were acsigned a number calling for
tickets of a certain class, without a
definite designation of the seats as In
oilier years. Those first In line ob
tained the better seats as they were
distributed by the ticket sellers, and
it was to obtain this advantage that
applicants sought the leading places
in the lines. v
In all probability, club officials
agree, more persons have been disap
pointed through failure to receive
tickets this year than ever before.
The fact that the series opens In
Boston and that the third game in
that city, the fifth of the series, will
be played on Columbus day, a holiday,
if the schedule is followed, has great
ly increased the demand. Hundreds
of requests have been refused.
BLANCHE BATES CAUSE OF SUIT
Action Against Film Company After
She Refuses "Screen Test."
New York, Oct. 6. The Popular
Film Corporation, which is being sued
by Charles Emerson Cook), Inc., for
money alleged to bo duo as agent's
commission, filed an answer yester
day saying Blanche Bates refused to
submit to a screen test and so no
agreement was made by the film cor
poration to employ her.
Lawrence S. Harris is president of
the film corporation, which, admitting
that it paid no part of $18,750 to the
plaintifi', says that In May Charles
Emerson Cook offered the services of
Blanche Bates and that tho defend
ant offered to employ her provided
she posed before the camera as a test
and the test resulted satisfactorily.
But the engagement was adjourned
Feveral times, says the defendant,
and the actress at length refused to
submit to the test.
Anyway, points out the film corpora
lion, it is a well known and long es
tablished custom in the motion pic
ture business for agents to collect
their commissions from employes and
not employers.

DOWN 0FFR0F
Had Agreed to Demanded Advance
of 45 Cents Per Hnnd ed
BUT FOR ONLY ONE MONTH
Producers Continue to Insist Contract
Shall Cover Period of Six
Months.
New York, Oct. C. Efforts to reach
a settlement of the deadlock between
distributros and dairymen which
threatens New York city with a milk
famine, failed late yesterday when
John J. Dillou, state commissioner of
foods and markets, who is the accredl
ted agent of the dairymen's league,
refused for his organization to accept
the advance in price demanded by the
farmers unless contracts were made
on a six-months' basis. He was sus
tained in his position by U. D. Coop
er, chairman of the executive commit
tee of the league.
The distributors, led by the Borden
condensed milk company, had agreed ,
to pay the 45 cents per 100 pounds
increase In price upon which the
league members insisted, but upon
the stipulation that it should be for
the month of October only. The ad
ded condition was imposed that an im
partial Investigating committee sat
isfactory to both bides to the contro
versy, should be appointed by Mayor
Mitchel for a further investigation of
conditions. The offer, it was an
nounced, was subject to the approval
of the district attorney. It was con
ditioned also "upon the dealers receiv
lng, as heretofore, milk from their for
mer patrons promptly and without
hindrance."
Under this offer, the price paid to
farmers for grade B milk-would bo
$2.39 a hundred pounds. A state-,
ment issued In behalf of the milk deal
ers said: "This price is made sim
ply to our Individual farmers. It is
not made with any league or with
Commissioner Dllllon and our busi
ness arrangements with the farmers
will be as heretofore as between the
various companies and themselves."
Representatives of the various in
terests involved were in conference
yesterday afternoon when the an
nouncement reached them that the
Borden company had decided to meet
the producers' demands for a higher
price. The offer was made, it was
said, in behalf of the public. "Tho
babies must come first and the milk
companies second," said Vice-President
H. N. Hallock. "So, although we
feel the increase Is excessive, we have
decided to meet It." The other dis
tributors decided they would be forced
to follow the lead of the Borden coin
panl. which handles one-fifth of the
2.50(),OO0 quarts distributed daily In
