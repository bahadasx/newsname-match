spirit of the occasion and never be

in Bemidjl.
Many Merrymakers.
The armory where the booths and
Kangaroo court were in operation
and the city hall where the dance
~was given were filled with merry
makers and the fun lasted until late
last night.
'w The Kangaroo court during the
^^vening did a big business. Twenty
five men were arrested and paid fines
amounting to $30.75. Two broke
jail, one wrote an I. O. U. for the
fine, one promised to pay a fine when
he had money and one fine was sus
pended.
When Eduard Netzer and Phil Gill
were arrested, John Morrison, who
acted as judge, adjourned court for
an hour and locked the men in the
jail Netzer escaped and the city is
on a "man hunt Every indication
is that Netzer will be captured again
and locked up
