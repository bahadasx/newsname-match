CREWS ARE BUSY
ONJHE SURVEY
Find Reed's Creek Grade a
Heavy One
Advices from the Clearwater dis
rict show that the two railroad
crews placed in the field about two
months ago by the Chicago, Mil
waukee & St. Paul road are still
engaged in their work. The ciew
which started out of Elk River to
run a line down Elk Creek to Big
Island on the North Fork is seem
ingly now engaged in permanent
location work, having apparently
secured a satisfactory grade, but
the second crew on Reed's creek is
still employed running preliminary
lines. It seems that the latter crew
has been unable to get a better
grade than three per cent up Reed's
creek from the river and is said to
be running a line on this heavy
grade. Reed's creek enters the
North Fork a short distance above
Big Island and its headquarters are
in the timber belt contiguous to
Pierce City.
Statement is made that it is the
hope of the company that the sur
veys can be fully completed before
early snows may drive out the crews.
It is generally understood that
the railroad company, due to ar
to
W.
by
of
rangements made with the Clear
water Timber company and the s
Scofield interests, has decided to in
build this railroad if the cost comes
within a specific sum, and it is fur
ther known that the preliminary!
estimate of the engineers indicates
this condition can be met. The
work has disclosed that an eminent
ly satisfactory line has been found
down Elk Creek to the North Fork
and the only doubtful condition is
that which applies to securing a
satisfactory line up Reed's creek.
That President Weyerhauser is
keeping in close touch with the sit
uation is indicated by the follow
ing article appearing in last week's a
issue of the Elk River Sentinel :
•'John P. Weyerhauser, president
of the Clearwater Timber company,
accompanied by A. W. Laird, gen- !
eral manager, and M. L. Seymour,.
mill superintendent of the Potlatch
company, came in Tuesday on bus
iness. Mr. Weyerhauser was se
curing information for future use
and during much of his stay was
immersed in maps and blue prints.
Before leaving Wednesday after
noon for the coast he stated that he
was still unable to say what the
Clearwater company would do, or
when. It has its plans fairly well
blocked out, but they depend on
others so much that he is unable to !
state anything definite for publica
tion. The company's plans will
permit it to make any one of half a
dozen arrangements if circum
stances should make a change nec

Captain Wilson Wounded
Boise, Idaho.—A special dispatch
to the Idaho Statesman from No
gales, Ariz., says that Captain H.
W. Wilson, Second Idaho medical
corps, was dangerously shot in the
left thigh Sunday afternoon in the
railroad station at Nogales, Ariz.,
by a Carranza Mexican soldier, who
fired from a position in front of
the Bank of Sonora, on the Mexican
side of the international boundary. !
The soldier was seen running away. ;
Captain Wilson had just checked !
his trunk for Twin Falls, Idaho, his
home, where he was going on a 30
day furlough. Excitement is at :
fever heat among the guardsmen,
the correspondent said.
Following the shooting, the No
gales dispatch continued, Captain ;
Wilson was rushed to the base hos
pital , where he was attended by
Captain Pittenger and Major Con
ant.
The guard on the border was im
mediately increased, sentries being
stationed 30 feet apart.
Army officers here say it is the j
first case during the border trouble
of an American officer being shot |
on American soil by an assailant
from the Mexican side.
How to Make Vinegar
:
!
In the manufacture of vinegar on
tbe ^ arm > it > s necessary to under
s t an d the actions which take place
in the conversion ot sweet cider in
to v5ne e ar in order to obtain good
results year after year.
Cleanliness is an important fac
tor in the extraction of the cider
from the apples. The extra trou
ble of turning a hose upon toe
apples or dumping them into a tub
of water before grinding will be
more than repaid in results obtained.
After coming from the press,
pour the cider into a clean barrel
and allow to stand until the solid
mâtter settles. Pour off and dis
card the solid matter. Now pour
a clean barrel full of the clear
liquid, put a cotton plug into the
bung, and then place in a room as
near to 70 degrees Fahrenheit as
possible. The addition of yeast to
the cider at this time will hasten
the action. The alcoholic action or
the changing of the sugar in the
cider to alcohol caused bv yeasts
will now take place. The progress
of this action may be observed by
the bubbles which rise to the sur
face of the cider. When the bub
bles no longer rise, the action is
complete unless the temperature is
so low that the yeast cannot work.
The length of time necessary for
this alcoholic action to become com
pleted depends upon the tempera
ture of the room and whether veast
was added. If yeast was added
and the room temperature is about
70 degrees Fahrenheit, the action
will probably be complete within 3
weeks. If the temperature is much
lower than this, it may be 3 months
, before the bubbles quit rising to
1 surface. The bubbles are carbon

The library committee of the uni
versity of Idaho believes that the j
value of a book lies in its use and
would therefore like to call the at- a
tention of the people of the state of !
Idaho to the fact that the library!
will lend any reading material in its
possession to other institutions or to 1
individuals of the state. There is no j
charge to those borrowing except
the price of sending and returning
the material. The time limit is one,
month, provided the books are not
needed by the students of the uni
versity, in which case it will be
necessary to ask that the books be j
returned before the expiration of
the time. An extension of the
stitutions.
So far as limited funds and books
will permit, the university library
will also help in the answering of
general reference questions and j
will write letters of advice to those
communities wishing to
libraries. Requests will

that Idaho people will patronize
their library and obtain the maxi

Big Mail Sent to Elk City
Lewiston, Idaho, Oct. 1.—The
Lewiston postoffice yesterday for
warded eight tons of groceries by
parcel post, consigned to the Elk i
City mining district. The rate
from this point to Elk City is 54
cents for each 50-pound package,
making $172 for the shipment.
The government pays for the move
ment of the goods from the post
office to the cars, pays the railway
company for moving them to Stites,
pays for the movement from the
car to the postoffice at Stites, and
will pay $2 a hundred from
to the destination. The same ship
ment by freight would have cost
$480. The parcel post business
through Stites, which is the termi

the Northern Pacific, amounted to
100,000 pounds in August, and will

KENDRICK FAIR
VERY SUCCESSFUL
-- j
Big Crowds Attend on Last
Day !
The Kendrick Fair and Harvest
Festival was very successful this
year. The fair association reports
a small surplus in the treasury at
ter paying all expenses. This is an
unusual occurance for the fairs here
as the association usually expects a
deficit.
The exhibits were good and too
much credit cannot be given to the
farmers who so loyally assisted the
committee by bringing in their
farm products for display. It was
a very busy time for everyone as
the bean harvest was in full sway,
but many farmers stopped their
wor k long enough to bring in veg
etables, fruits and grain to help
fill up the tables in the pavilion.
A large crowd attended Friday in
spite of the busy season and every
one appeared satisfied with the
attractions offered. The ideal
weather conditions greatly added to
the dav's pleasure.
The livestock department was a
failure, owing to the fact that those
who had blooded stock to bring in
were too busy to take the time re

Grain Car Shortage
The Lewiston valley and tribut
ary territory are feeling the effects
of the car shortage, which is em
barraS£ ing the movement of grain.
Camas Prairie line, from
Reparia to Grangeville, the short
age amounted to 169 cars. 86 of
which should have been furnished
by the Northern Pacific and 83 by
the O.-W. R. & N. company. The
O.-W. R. & N. company is operat
ing steamers on the Snake river re
moving grain from the river ware
house not reached by rail to the
three railway transfers at Lewiston,
Crum and Riparia, and the short
age of cars is beginning to hamper
the boat operations, as the avail
able transfer storage room is over
flowing, with no apparent hope of
relief.
Death of Mrs. Oveson
Mrs. Valborg Oveson was bora
Sept. 27, 1823 near Trondhjem,
Norway. In 1885 she and her hus
band emigrated to Jackson County,
Minn., where they made their home
with her daughter, Mrs. J. J.
Slind, until 1898, when they moved
to Windom, Minn. She came west
in 1907 the year her husband died.
A year later she came to Big Bear
ridge where she made her home
with her daughter till the time of
her death, Sept. 24th. She lived
to be 92 years, 11 months and 27
days old.
For over 30 years she has been a
true Christian, always striving to do
something good for others, and
greatly loved by all who came in
contact with her.
The funeral services were held at
the Lutheran church, Sept. 26th, by
Rev. A. Hoi beck. The remains
were laid to rest at the Lutheran
cemetery.
Four daughters, Mrs. R. Tvvog,
Colville, Wash.; Mrs. J. Berg, Spc
kane; Mrs. S. Simonson, Spokane;
Mrs. J. J. Slind; Two sons, L. O.
Oveson, Everett, Wash.; O. O. Ove
son, Thief River Falls, Minn, and a
sister, Mrs. Vinge of Spokane, will
deeply mourn her loss.
It was alwavs her earnest prayer
1 that God would call her home while
asleep. This was fulfilled as the last
36 hours of her life was a sleep in

Raises Seed Beans
Chris Dunn has started something
new on his farm seven miles south
of Troy on Driscoll Ridge. This
year he is raising 15 acres of beans
for a Spokane seed house, and the
experiment is proving so successful
that already experts representing
Spokane and Portland seed houses
have announced that there will be
200 acres of beans for seed raised
in that particular neighborhood
! Of the seed beans raised by Mr
1 un , n this year 10 acres are of the
}^ ack va £! e ^ y and d y e acres tke
brown^ They have done except.om
the profits will be satisfactory.
Agents of seed houses inspected the
crop while it was growing and de
dared that the conditions for bean
; raising were the best they had
found anywhere in their travels.
lit is certain that a nice industry is
! to grow up along this line on Dris
.
c °lJRidge.
Mr. Dunn is not depending whol
j ly on seed beans, however. He has
90 acres of fine navy beans on his
! place this year. Of this acreage he
has raised 50 himself. He is confi
dent the yield will run from 700 to
750 pounds to the acre and he ex
pects to sell his crop for not less
than five cents a pound. Even at
700 pounds to the acre this would
mean $1750 for his bean crop.
They are all thoroughly matured
and half of them in the stack. Next
year he will go into bean raising
much more extensively as he has
all the needed machinery purchased
and paid for.—Post.

THE 6ENI STATE
FAIR AT BOISE
Governors From Washington
Oregon And Idaho Attend
The Gem State Fair is a thing of
the past. It occurred last week
and it was nearly all its name im
plied. It was a splendid exhibition
from beginning to end, but it lack
ed the State features to some ex
tent. None of the accessories of a
first class exhibition were lacking
but it is not of these that we write.
There are a few salient points that
distinguished this show from others
of its kind and these are of state
wide interest.
The Barbecue, as handled by the
Boise City Commercial Club, cannot
be excelled. It is said that to see a
barbecue in all its completeness one
must go to southern California
where they are served a la Spanish.
There is some truth in that as at
those barbecues there was always a
barrel of wine on tap for those who
had not acquired the coffee habit.
Ardent prohibitionist as the writer
is, he cheerfully admits, with fond
recollections, that wine and barbe
cued meat mix well. Of course the
Commercial Club was compelled by
legal fiat, to confine itself to a
drink that cheers but does not in
ebriate. Seven full grown beeves
were roasted and converted into
I sandwiches, and these with other
good things, were served to a hun
gry multitude by more than forty
daintily clad waiters. The demand
was so great that the service lasted
a full half day.
After the inner man was fully
satisfied the three Governors of the
great northwest were introduced to
the waiting thousands. This was
in conformity with a previous ar
rangement that the three Governors
from Washington, Oregon and Idaho
would visit.the three state Fairs in
a body. Governor Ernest Lister of
Washington and Governor James
Withycombe of Oregon were present
to carry out their part of the con
tract with Governor Moses Alexan
der.
These men proved a great at
traction, and made the first day of
the Fair one of the best of the
week. Their addresses were of a
high order, Carefully thought out.
They unanimously agreed that pro
hibition had come to stay in the
northwest. It was said that this
question was brought up at the
breakfast table when Joel Priest
(you all known Joel) experience
great difficulty in an attempt to
drink a glass of pure water.
In their addresses the Governors
were fully agreed that the great
northwest is the best portion of this
great big world. Its men, its women
its hogs, its horses, its cattle were
all of superior quality. They be
lieve in the farmer, and with good
reasons given, showed their opti
mism. It was indeed remarkable
to notice how these brethern thought
alike and how they loved one an
other.
But the scribe was not satisfied
to know the opinion of these really
great Governors about hogs and
things. Who will be our next pres
ident? Goveror Lister was just as
sure that W'ilson would carry Wash
ington as Governor Alexander was
that Wilson would carry Idaho. But
Oregon will be overwhelmingly for
Hughes. Here were three splendid
men from three solidly Republican
states. Why were two of them
Democrats?
Politics aside these men are splen
did representatives of their respec
tive states and on these Agricultural
visits they get very close to the
people and are accomplishing much
good. Tney proved an ornament to
the Gem State Fair and that is
what we intended to say from the
beginning.—Special Correspondent.
