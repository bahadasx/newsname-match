Says Only United States is
Strong Enough to Restore
Order in Mexico.
Chicago. I1L, Oct 6. A wholesale
and bitter condemnation of the ad

delivered Thursday night by former
United States senator Albert J. Bever
Idge, at the formal opening of the Re
publican epeaking campaign at the
Auditorium here. His speech carried
a strong Intervention tinge.
Concerning Mexican affairs, he said,
in part:

administration did not content itself
with refusing to recognize this de facto
government but ordered It to dissolve
without a successor to take its place.
The administration did this upon the
pretexts that the de facto Mexican
government had not gained power ac-
cording to the constitution and laws , l rmsn pressure on the eastern end
of that country and that the de facto of the line. Here the Bulgarians have

and from that duty we must not flinch.
Friiltt of "Watchful Waltintr.
"There were only two sane courses
to take In Mexico to go in and re
store order to the anarchy-maddened
creatures of that country or to keep
out and leave them to their mutual
destruction. But the administration
did both and neither. If to safe
guard American lives Is a duty, then
the administration fled from that dut
If to protect American property Is an
obligation, the administration repu

WATERFORD. Ireland. Oot 6.
In a notable address to his

noon. John Redmond, the Irish nation
alist leader in parliament, declared that
despite the recent rebellion, "with all
its Inevitable aftermath of brutalities,
stupidities and inflamed passions,"
home rule for Ireland is safe if Ire
land remains sane. Mr. Redmond also
declared that conscription could never
be forced upon Ireland, adding:
"I cannot bring myself to believe
that malign though the Influences at
work are. the government will be in
sane enough to challenge a conflict
with Ireland on this subject. Conscrip

array and the war. would be the most
fatal thing that could happen."

"It would be resisted in etery village

would be a scandal which would ring
