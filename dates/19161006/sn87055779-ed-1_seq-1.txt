Intem,itH)nal News Service:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. The new
fovernment eit?ht-hour day commis
sion, when the members met here
for formal organization and to besm
their work, will first turn to Chi
cago and the middle west in their
investigation of railway pay and
hours of labor. It is considered that
the bitf railroads with terminals In
Chicago more nearly typify condi
tions throughout the country than
do the railroads branching out
from any other city.
The commissioners will begin
their work with a framework on
which to base their findings await
ing them. Hy the appointment of
Commissioner Clark, of the inter
state commerce commission, as a
member of the eight-hour day com
mission, all the data obtained
through the interstaie commerce
commission's investigation into the
physical valuations of railroads will
be available for use by the eight
hour day body.
Formal organization of the com
mission will be made shortly. Com

ready in a few days.
Gen. Goethals and Commissioner
'lark, being already employes of tho
government, will not receive addi
tional pay for their work, thniuh all
expenses tf the commission are to
be paid. George I liublee. how
ecr. probably will receive a salary,

since being rejected by the senate
as a member of the federal trade
commission, he is vor5---ig for the

News-Times Special Service:
NKW YORK, Oct. 6. Boies Pen

ters of the republican national com
mittee and enjoyed the unique ex
perience of sitting down in party
counsel with Chairman Willcox and
George W. Perkins. The warmth

construed as public recognition of!
the Pennsylvania old Kuard repre
sentative as the sole and exclusive
manager of Mr. Hughes' campaign
in the Keystone state.
The spectacle of Mr. Penrose and
Mr. Perkins collaborating in sup
port of Mr. Hughes is a little more
than New York progressives are
able to digest with relish.
As indicative of the real feeling
of progressives in this state, John J.
O'Connell, chairman of the New
York county progressive committee,
announced today that he would lead
a large delegation of New York pro
gressives to Shadow Lawn on Sat
urday to hear Pres't "Wilson's ad
dress. Iro2TCN.sivcs for Wilson.
The attitude of the genuine pro
gressives of this state is further em
phasized in a telegram sent today hy
Dainbride Colby, progressive candi
date for United States senator, to
Francis J. Heney, progressive lead
er of California, which is in part as
follows:
"As a progressive I am support
ing Pres't Wilson because he is the
foremost progressive in the country
today. His record is one of devo
tion to progressive principles and of
extraordinary persistence and suc
cess in translating them into law.
"The opposition to the president is
sinister anj contemptible. It is
composed of all the shrill and dis
cordant forces of envy, selfishness,
privilege and faction, both alien and
natiee."
Commenting upon the situation
presented by these developments,
Chairman Vance McCormick today
said:
"The real progressives are not be
ing fooled for a minute. They know
that Hughes is the candidate of all
the obi rock-ribbed standpatters.
Hughes is telling them one thing
and Roosevelt something else. Its
too fishy. They are net going to
swallow it."
Samuel J. Graham of Pittsburgh,
assistant United States attorney gen
eral, called upon Chairman McCor
mick of the democratic national
committee today and laid emphasis
on1 the dangerous doctrine being
preached by Col. Roosevelt and "his
protege," Mr. Hughes. Mr. Graham
said :
"Mx-Pres't Rooseelt in his Rattle
Creek speech stated in connection
with the anthracite coal strike, that
he had instructed the general in
tommand of the army, if he so
ordered, to take control of th; prop
erties and act as re ivcr. This
would hae been a gro.- usurpation
of executive authorit and a viola
tion of the laws "of (he country, as
only the courts have the right to ap
I oint receivers, after a hearing.
"In this same speech he stated
that after the sinking of the Lusi
tania he would have seized all of the
German ships in our ports. ob
serve, tirst. that there were three
men-of-war in our poits. To ha
seized these ships would have been
a declaration of war, and Germany
would have replied to it with a dec
laration of war. Also to have seized
the privately awned ships would
have been a violation of interna
tional law. Recause we were at
peace with Germany.
"Col. Roosevelt's declaration that
he would have seized these ships of
war shows that hrd he or his pro
tege. Mr. Hughes, been in the white
house we would have been at war
with Germany. It is fair to assume
that if Mr. Hughes is elected and a
similar occasion arises. the same
result would follow.'

NEW

EXPECTED TO
Concessions to Public Senti
ment in United States to
be Made Soon, Accord
ing to Cable Advices.
WILL DEFEND ACTION
TAKEN AGAINST CHINA
Open Door Policy to be Rigid
ly Adhered to Japan is
Only Warring Naticn
Enjoying Prosperity.
International News Serrl;e:
WASHINGTON. Oct. 6. Japan
intends to make concessions to pub
lic sentiment in the United States,
according to cable information
reaching a high diplomatic source
today. Within a short time the new
cabinet will issue a statement of in
tentions, which, officials who are
watching the situation very closely
here, say will be of a most concil
iatory character.
It will defend the aggressive ac
tion heretofore taken in China on
the ground it was necessary, owing
to the failure of the Chinese govern
ment to rule certain provinces with
a strong hand, but will insist that
the open door policj-, to which the
United States la pledged, will be
rigidly adhered to.
The action is due, the confidential
advices say, to the realisation by
the Japanese officials that the ap
pointment of Field Marshal Count
Seika Terauchi as premie., has
caused unfavorable comment in this
country. The fact that the new
prime minister is the leader of the
military party and stands squarely
for increased expenditures for the
army and navy has made it plain to
America that the new Japanese
policy is to be strengthened so far
us foreign .relations are concerned.
But officials in diplomatic circles who
are in closest touch with the situa
tion in Japan say that this policy
will not be aggressive in any way in
dealing with the United States.
Fnjoyltis: lrospority.
It is pointed out that Japan at
present is enjoying unparalleled
prosperity. She is the only nation
that is a party to the european war
which is not tafferintr from its ef
fects, liussia is being armed by
Japan and her recent successes are
due entirely to the supplies made
there and shipped across the trans
Siberia railway to the eastern front.
These supplies are paid for in gold
and, in addition. Japan is making
great inroads into the trade of South
America and the United Stntes.
The Japanese imports into this
country are of every possible char
acter. The toy trade, formerly
monopolized by Germany, has passed
entirely into the hands of the Jap
anese so far as the cheap jrrades are
concerned.

An Appreciation
M. Joseph county has observed
the centennial of Indiana's admis
sion to the federal union. The cele
bration of observance was a tremen
dous .success. People entered Into
the spirit of the occasion with zest
and endeavoiiecl by individual effort
to make the affair all that was de
sired. The weather was almost ier
fect. Thousands from other citio
did the county honor by accepting
the general invitation to Ik present.
The response was generous and ap
preciative. The South Hend's Indiana centen
nial association knows of no way,
except through the press, to express
Vt all, its real appreciation of the
cordial support it received. It
would gladly send n letter of appre
ciation to each person but dan's not,
for S4 many thousands contributed
so penennisly in lalnr aiul talent and
inihienee tc success that it would
miss many. It, therefore, through
tho courtesy of the press, extends its
deep, sincere and most earnest ap
preciation to all.
On nearly every side this associa
tion received cordial, grnorous sup
port and most sincerely regrets that
it Is not in a position to extend to
each ierson or organization so freely
Civilis1 that support an individual
expression of Its gratefulness for
participation, for support and for
services rendered in so worthy a
cnuse as the observance of our great
state's 100th anniversary. We feel
confident that all who had any part
whatever in this observance will al
ways remember with sentiments of
honest pride that they had such a
part, for none of today will able
to participate in Indiana's second
century observance.
