Writer Takes Issue with Flint j
Ridge?Peas and Potatoes
Plentiful.
Primus, Oct. 6.?I again take
Pi ensure in writing a few lines for \
The News from the garden spot of j
the county. I see the Flint Ridge
correspondent is trying to claim the
gnrden spot for his particular sec- *
tion. He made the statement that 1
' "" I <
S. Estridge, has gotten into the war '
with that fellow in Florida about the^
hook of Revelation, endeavoring to [1
figure out the war in the said hook. v
This particular book seems to be a '
hidden mystery to the minds of most *'
of the people, being especially very *
hard to understand, the fact being 9
most of our highly educated preach- c
era do not care to tackle it. I believe '
a large portion of the visions that 1
John saw while on the Isle of Patmus v
are yet to come to pass and have not ^
as yet been fulfilled. Brother Es-i
tridge, when you and the Brother
down in Florida decide the war in 1
Europe, please explain the 8th chap- v
ter of Revelation to me.
I am indeed glad to note that 1
Lancaster is to have a county fair 1
this fall. I think a county fair is a '
great thing for any county front many 1
standpoints. Let us all pull together 11
and make it a great success. I notice '
fi
the little shows are to be bark ar the
c
fair. I trust the manager will not
allow those gambling machines to 0
operate on the grpunds. I hope the
good people of the county will not
tolerate nor patronize such stufT. *
Mr. Editor, I always like to co-'n
operate with men in any good enter-M
prise. Men are valuable to any cause "
in proportion as they are able and
willing to work in harmony with ''
other men. When a person looses '
his ability and willingness to co-op- j 1
erate with others, he has then joined "
the down and out club. The kickers''1
have quit kicking in our community 0
and Primus will not be reDresented ^
In the big convention to be held Or-1'
tober 24 In Columbia, called by one. n
Mr. W. A. James of Hiahopville.
Mr. D. J, Hinson of Rich Hill In r
making the rounds with hia pea '
thraaher. Peaa and potatoes are in '

I will have to cloae thia letter as 1 ^
must leave for Reever Creek to attend

will be in session for four days. When
I return I will write again, especially o
since we are to have that flour mill, ti

Oadren City, Kana., Oct. 4.?Fred a
k M. Gljmer. a wealthy farmer, and his b
\ /bride were placed In Jail here today't
charged with having poisoned Hanna ii
Ollmer, the man's first wife, who died t
two months ago. They were arrest- ;t
ed on information filed by William ?
Harris, son of the dead woman. i
Heath Springs took the rag off the <
bush September 12th, and that Flint ,
Ridge was a close neighbor to Heath
Springs. 1 happen to know both
placeR and Flint Ridge is three oij*
four miles from the town of Heath s
Springs. I did not claim in my ar->t
ticle that Primus was the cleanest |1
spot on earth; I said "Garden Spot,"ic
meaning in the term t>f farming and,t
etc. Heath Springs may have gotten,I
on the bulletin board, for cleanliness f
bu\ ^he has not gotten there on farming.
I still hold to what I said; '
Primus is the garden spot and In 1
making this claim for our community '
I have not included another neigh- s
borhood with it which I note th?* j
Flint Ridge correspondent has done L
when he includes Heath Springs in II
his territory. The Flint Ridge cor- |
respondent endeavors to cover too
much ground. Again I notice in
"Wednesday's issue of the News tliatj
* he stated that I claimed Primus to;
be the garden spot of the world, when
as a matter of fate he knew that 1
had not seen all of the world, there
fore, was not in position to make
such a statement. He also stated that J
Flint Ridge was going to have a
community fair to which he gave the
good editor, Mr. Luther Ellison, and
myself a special invitation to come.
Thank you, Mr. Correspondent, I will h
try to to be on hand and will'bring 4
my old white Leghorn rooster with 1
me. I know he will take off one of '
your ribbons without a doubt.

FLETCHER TAKES' I

POST OF IMPORTANCE
\flfects Country's Foreign Trade
Relations as Well as Internal
Waterways.
Washington, Oct. 4.?It has been
laid that fate and circumstances?
win brothers?bring about some'
strange results?results so full of]
he psychological element that the
tuman mind is often taxed to underhand
them. Just at a time when the
South was needing the brain and
linew of congress to deal with the lnricate
international problems that
Mil come up hereafter in commercial
elations with both Germany and the '
lilies, death knocked at the door of 1
Senator James I'. Clarke of Ajkan- 1
ias. Senator Clarke was chairman '
if the powerful senate committee o'n
ommerce, and by his removal his
nantle falls on the shoulders of a
veil?known Southerner?Senator D.
J. Fletcher of Florida.
When congress meets again in Be- '
ember Senator Fletcher will go to
he chairmanship of this committee,
vfiich is the same as both the rivers
inu harbors coniihittee and the com'
1
nittee on interstate and foreign comnerce
of the house. Thus, while
'Morida recently defeated Congressnan
S. M. Sparkman for re-election
,nd lost the chairmanship of the riv-1
irs and harbors committee, that
itate gets the chairmanship back by
Senator Fletcher going into the place
if Senator Clarke.
Senator Fletcher's ardent advo- j
?cy of river and harbor work is well :
mown over the country and there
i^ed be. no fear that hereafter pro-1,
ects iheriting advancement will be]
le^lected. |
It is quite probable that at an early ll
late congress will be called upon to
uka action regarding retaliatory
neat^ures which the State depart-1
aent is said to be preparing to put. I
nto effect against Clreut Britain beause
of her recently blacklisting

Mr. J. T. Thompson, president of ol
the Lancaster County Fair Asaocia- at
tion, in conversation with The News dl
representative Thursday stated: b<
"From all reports which I have so far in
received, I am convinced that the M
third annual fair, to be held in Lan- r<
caster November 20-25, will be a sue- |
cess in every way. Hardly a day ti
pusses but what I receive encouran- M
in it reports irom many parts of the] ft
county, and taking all into considers- |ai
tion, I am thoroughly convinced that d
the event will materialize into the(?r
best ever. One important factor w
which convinces me of its ultimate|Cj
success, is the enthusiastic manner in 1 ii
which the committees have gone
about the work. I wish to urge all a
the people the county over to join in rs
the undertaking and let us mak^ it b
truly a fair worth while." n
President Thomasson is indeed
gratified at the splendid manner in
which the people have responded to s
the cause, and well he should be for e
from present indications we are go- a
ing to witness one of the best fairs
it! Lancaster to be found anywhere. "
