FOR CONGRESS
Appeals to His Friends in the
Eighth District.
On Monday, September 25, 1 was
officially notified of my nomination
for Congress. I. immediately sent
out a list of dates and mapped out
an itiuary of the entire district. I
intended to speak nine or ten times
in each couuty and meet the most
of the voters and present my claims
in person. But it is often the un
expected happens. In less than a
day from the time I became a can
didate I was stricken with facial
paralysis. A week has past. My
dates have been canceled and I am
still unable to make a public ad
dress I am under the care of two
physicians, who assure me that I
will be well and strong in a short
while. Just as soon as it is advis
able for me to do so yon may rest
assured that I will be on the firing
line. .
This temporary hindrance is a
great disappointment to me, for I
Lad intended to make the most
vigorous canvass ever made in this
Congressional District. But no
true soldier surrenders because he
is temporarily disabled, and no
loyal army will retreat because of
the temporary disability of their
leader. As I am not able to be in
the fight and speak for myself, I
earnestly beg of my friends to work
all the harder and leave nothing
undone that can honorably be done
to help me win the race.
For nine years my voice has been
heard in defense of human rights
from ocean to ocean, from New
3Tork to Texas. More than two
thousand times these lips that now
refuse to do my bidding have plead
your cause. In more than twenty
five States and in State and national
capitals this tongue that is now un
steady has spoken for your rights.
No man on the continent has work
ed harder for the cause of the com
mon people, for equity, for justice
and better conditions, better laws,
greater income, happier homes and
brighter firesides than I.
I have answered every call.
I have faltered before no obsta
ole, I have neglected no duty. .
I have shirked no task -
I have defied and overcome every
difficulty. " "
I did not seek this nomination,
but solicitation from voters in all
political parties persuaded me to
make the race, and now that I need
your friendship and assistance
more than ever before, shall I be
forsaken?
Friends, I earnestly beseech you
to rally to my support in this time
uf need, and we will win. I am
asking nothing unreasonable.
Eighty per cent of the people of
this Congressional District are
farmers. Every man in the dis
trict in the district is either direct
ly or indirectly interested in agri
culture. Yet a farmer has not
represented you in Congress in
fifty years. My opponent is not a
'farmer. Yon have been exceed
ingly kind to keep him in Congress
' twenty years This case is in your
Imods. The verdict rests with
yL The decision will be made
-y you. I will do what, I can. I
will talk through the press now
jhkI from the stump later when
able. :
For nine years I have unselfishly
nerved yon. I have been onmind
U of my health ami have impaired
sutue'ft than spared the -splendid
constitution which nature gave me,
I have met most of you face to face
You know my life. You know my
record. You also know when in

me uusimgs. x nave Deen your
friend in the past and will be your
friend in the future, regardless of
the result of this election. I shal
work in the future, as I have in the
past, for you and yours, whether
in Congress or in other fields of
battle wherever opportunity offers.
I appeal not only to farmers but
to every voter in the district who
believes that I am worthy to rep
resent them in Congress, to stand
at their post until after the votes
are cast and counted November 7.
If you elect me to Congress, I
shall feel as I vote on various meas
ures that I must represent every
man, woman and child in the dis
trict. I have volunteered as a sol
dier in the army of progress, and
if I can only perform my task to
the end so that it may be said in
truth, "he did his best," I shall lay
that offering at the feet of Him
who sees deeper than human eyes
and holds the destiny of eternity
in His hand.
Sincerely yours, i
L. M. Rhodes.

A MISUNDERSTANDING.
The following letter from State
Superintendent S. W. Sherrill to
The Chronicle throws more light
on the school problem:
I am informed that there is some
dissatisfaction in your county rela
tive to the opinion of the Attorney
General as to the legality of sec
ondary schools. I am sure this
dissatisfaction comes about from a
misunderstanding for I know if
the good people of your county
only understood they would see
better things are in store for them.
It is not the intention of the law
to take secondary educational ad
vantages away from the rural dis
tricts but the intention is to give it
to them in a much better form.
The law providing for a second
ary school made no restrictions as
to the number of schools estab
lished or number of teachers em
ployed. As a result a vast number
of these schools were established.
In many of them there were as few
as one or two pupils. In a second
ary school of one of our leading
counties I found a teacher last
year paid $75 a month to teach four
pupils in the ninth grade and three
in the tenth, or $10.70 per month
per pupil. On the other hand in
many of these schools we find one
eacher tried to teach ten grades,
this no teacher can do. In such
schools we find. the teacher devot
ing almost as much time to the
very few secondary pupils as to the
fifty or sixty elementary pupils,
thus robbing the elementary child
of the time and money that the
State intended for him. I can not
say that any of these conditions
existed in your couuty but I do
know they existed in many couu
ties of the State. For these rea
sons the secondary school has been
very unsatisfactory. What can
ake its place? We answer, the
third class or two-year high school.
say this for two reasons; first,
these schools can be standardized.
The law prescribes conditions that
must be met. These conditions
guarantee the - protection of the
best interest of the child. There
is a uniform course of study.. A
pupil completing the work in these
schools is given credit , bv the
State. Second, to have this work
done as high schools puts the coun
ty in line for the State to give it
its share of the high school fund.
The State gives oue-third of the
amount speut in high schools.
What is necessary to be done to
get State aid? The County Court
must elect a County High School
Board and provide funds. The
duty of the board will be to handle
the high school business. This
board elects high school teachers,
locates the high schools, etc. In
your county I would advise the
establishing of a sufficient number
of these schools to suit the con
venience of the people of your
county. The geography of the
county will have to determine the
number of schools to establish. , I
am k strong believer in carrying
the high school advantages back
close to the Deoole. In levvinc
the high school tax, I, of course,
would advise to levy a tax in addi
tion to the school tax, say ten
cents, or enough to create a fund
sufficient to run your high schools
and place it as a high school tax.
That is exactly what you are now
doing but you are not doing it in
such a way as to permit the State
to give you one-third of what you
raise.
In conclusion let me say the dis
organized secondary school is gone.
It is gone, first because it was in
efficient, and, second, because in
such schools the State can not give
aid.
In July eigiit counties of our
State established two-year high
schools in place of secondary
schools and all are delighted with
the change. High schools have
been provided in seventy-three
counties of our State and I sin
cerely hope your county will join
the ranks.
Respectfully,
S. W. Sherrill,
State Superintendent
