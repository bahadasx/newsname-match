ASKING
NEW OFFER BY FARMERS
TO END THE MILK FAMINE:
HORTON ON WITNESS STAND
If Distributors Agree to Six Months'
- Contracts, Dairymen Are Willing
' to Abide by Any Price Wicks Com-
. mittee May Say Is Fair.
A plan to compromise the milk strike was proposed late this after
noon. It came from John J. Dillon, State Commissioner of Foods anil
Markets, the New York Agent 6t ilw. Daitymen's League. He said that
Tluf 'farmers will not insist on a six months' contract with the big dealers
ivlio sell milk here.
"Let them mako the contract for
six months," he added, "with thie
proviso that, if the Wicki com'
mittee reports thAt the farmers
are asking too much for their
milk in this schedule, we will ac
eept whatever price the Wicks
committee says is fair."
It Is a matter of record ttiat the
Wicks committee ban already ex
pressed the opinion that the farmers
wero not Getting enough for their
milk.
All Indications lain till afternoon
pointed to nn early settlement of tho
controversy. The State hearings of
the counter ehnrgos of consp'rney
tinder the Donnelly Act, made by the
distributors and the Dnlrynw .l's
Lcinsuc, were begun by Unfnree
Dykmnn.
To-day's Kiipply f i"Hk was tho
lowest yet, belnif only 720,000 qmr's,
or less than mie-thlrd the nor.nal
iltinntlty.
Tho dairymen ore. getting tired of
tiirowlng tholr milk away and Urn
distribute are undergoing heavy
losses In diminished sales nnd etra
expense In supplying tho customers
they aro able to reach.
The dliti llmterM have already yieliled
to tho extent of allowing tho pro
ducers nn iucreaso of 4" cents a
bundled pounds, but aro holding out
against tbo demand of tho farmers
that they make contractu to run nix
months.
Despite efforts looking to a settle
ment, u mooting of directors of the
Harden Corporation was held at Its
ottlccs, No. 10S Hudson Street, this
afternoon, after which II. N. Hallock,
Vlco President, announced:
"Wo will not lecedo from our plan
lo purchase, milk from tho producers
on monthly contracts. Wo believe the
pilnclple of the contract to b right
for all concerned. This company will
continue to deal with ItH ptoducers.
allowing the Increase announced yes
terday, and no six months' contract
will be considered."
Mr. Hnllock also said the Horden
Company had effected nn Improo
inent In Its milk supply to-day, !nv
In'sr, he said, i.eciired between iO and
l.i per cent, of tho normal amount,
and by to-morrow, he said, ho e.i-
pected to Increase, this amount 'n li.'i
