Fine Exhibit Made Bett* ->rd
Than Last Year in Compel. >n
Against State.
Valley County again demonstrated
her ability to maintain a position in
the front ranks of the State as a pro-1
ducer not only of high class grains
but in vegetables and roots as well.
Altogether 30 premiums were carried
off by the exhibit from this county
and this is a pleasing result of the
time and money expended as it shows
an increase over those taken last year.
While there were not as many firsts
. .v
taken this year as last, owing to the
competition being strongei îom e
counties in t e sout ern por ion o
state, yet the secon s an n< s .. o\\
the countv is mowing it, t a... p
ducts.
One of the gratifying results of th e
exhibit consists in the taking of sec-,
ond place against the state for the
best six sugar beets. In this divi
sion there were beets shown from all
through the section of the state where
the Billings Sugar Co., secures its
supply as well as nearly every other
county exhibiting. The first prize
went to the Billings Politechnic School
and it was stated after the judge had
made the awards that the six beets
winning first had been selected from
125 tons of beets as they were deliv
ered to the Billings Sugar factory.
When it is remembered that the six
beets shown by Valley County were
selected from about 25 beets dug out
of a patch of less than an acre grown
by Ole Stensland, the winning of sec
ond place by these six beets speaks
volumes in favor of the possibilities
for sugar beet culture in the Milk
River Valley.
One other premium carried off by
Valley County exhibit worthy of con
sideration was that of second for the
best display of corn shown. In the
Valley county has
previous two years
won this premium and the prize com
ing as it did for the third consecutive
time is a sure proof that the corn
section of the
raised in this northern section of the
state need take no back seat for any
produced in the other sections. The
corn was not as good this year as
Valley county had a year ago and as |
a result the individual corn competi
tion was such as to eliminate the local
contestants with the exception of the
division for 12 stalks. In the latter
division the 12 stalks of corn shown
by C. A. Collins were so far ahead
of all others that there was hardly
any competition. There were 27 ears
of corn on the 12 stalks all fully ma
tured and weighing nearly twice as
much as other varieties.
J
The judge I
stated that it was the best sheaf of i
'corn he had seen during the fall in a !
trip that included three other state!
fairs. Many requests were made by j
Helena land men for the sheaf of
corn as well as all the railroad repre- ;
sentatives in attendance. Mr. Collins
gave the sheaf to the Great Northern
railway and it will be used in re- i
decorating the exhibit booth of that '
road at Glasgow.
Owine- to the car in which the ex- i
K '
hibit was sent to Helena being delayed
at Havre it did not arrive at the fair
, , , . ..
grounds until one day later than was
expected so that the work of placing
it in the booth allotted to Valley coun- J
ty was made exceptionally hard and it
was necessary to rush it along in or
der to be ready when the judging be
gan. As a result there was no op
portunity to enter into the county
collective competition. This was a
source of considerable regret to those
in charge of the exhibit.
In the vegetable and root crop divi
sions there was heavier competition
than ever before, many of the coun
ties having double the amount of en
r es they were showing a year ago,
and this made it necessary that the
bèst of quality be carried in the pro
ducts to get a place. Valley county
was in the competition all the time
, , , , . „ + . f
and the many prizes taken snow that

the quality was there.
W. J. Bryan was an interested vis
itor at the Valley county booth and
expressed great surprise in finding
such an excellent showing in agri
cultural products from a county locat-;

: Republicanism is the strong force

in the ability of Hughes to properly
handle the affairs of this great na
tion, which he heard on every side
causes him to be very optimistic as ;
to the results. He not only believes
the Republicans will win in the Na

strong in the belief that the state will
also be placed in that column when
the votes are counted. As -i man ;

years ago it would be hard to sell |
agricultural land in this section at j
$10.00 per acre and the good values j
plafed upon the land now is noticeable j
i to a greater extent than would main- 1

Register of State Lands Sid Nliller j
j was we ^ pleased with the results of j
the sa ' e and >t was his belief that,
; there would be a great additional in- j
crease in the values of land here dur- ■
j' n ST the next two years. The land ,

OPENS L VND OFFICE HERE
J S McHenery formerly located '
at Havre, has located in Glasgow and
opened up a real estate and land office
J
expecting to do a heavy business. Mr.
| McHenery stated that in his opinion
G'asgow would be cne of the largest

owing to the great agriciutiral ps- ;
sibiliv.es existing in Valley County. !

during the next few years will bring

He is making a tour of the state j
speaking at all the prominent points, !
treating the political situation in such
an intelligent manner as to win for
himself abundant praise and commen
dation. As a candidate he will at the
meeting tonight outline the work that
can be done for the state at Washing
ton and demonstrate his ability to
work for the enactment of legisla
tion desired.
Frank j. Edwards is well known tola
the people of Montana for his fearless
stand for the rights of the people
against all the menaces of big inter-j
ests. As Mayor of Helena he es
j tablished a record for justice and the
! enforcement of the laws as to win for

himself the highest praise from the
law abiding people and undying hat
\ ered from those who would have an
official wink at their misdeeds. As
j Republican candidate for Governor of
j Montana he is making a whirlwind
campaign with a most convincing line
j of argument.
Frank J. Edwards has successfully
upheld-the rights of the people of this
state ever since he has entered pub-,

HOME MADE CIGAR POP I. LAR
Reputations are made and held up
on action and results as is witnessed
I by the information gathered at the
j State Fair at Helena, last week. Dur
! mg the course of the work one day at
the exhibit building, S. C. Moore was
conversing with a traveling man who
had visited Glasgow the previous
week. The question of smokes came
up and the visitor remarked that he
i had secured a fine smoke while in the
j city sold under the Commercial Club
1 brand. He requested that when Mr.
I Moore returned to Glasgow, he order
tola box sent to him at Helena, as he
j found it the most enjoyable cigai he
: had smoked in many months. This
is quite a compliment to Pi ed Shoe
j craft who manufactures the Commer
.fiai Club cigar in this city and proves
that he is putting the quality into
the smokes. His business should de
velepe into a large institution within
i a short time.
NATIONAL BANK FOR OSWEGO
A charter has been granted foi the

Bank at Oswego and it will be open

The men interested are C. W. Wedge
; and C. J. Crogfoss, prominent bank
j ers of Granville, N. Dak. Mr. Wedge
is the present owner of a string of
banks throughout North Dakota and
recognized the possibilities of the busi
ness opportunities in this state. He
will place a strong financial bank at

TRAPPER TAKEN
BY GAME WARDEN
Deputy Game Warden Burke
Catches Law Breaker.
WAS TRAPPING BEAVER
1 When Arrested Chas. Hart Had Sev
eral Fresh Beaver Skins in
" His Possession.
I Chas. Hart, from nowhere, was ar
J rested last Friday by Deputy Game
Warden Geo. F. Burke, and Deputy
, sheriff Wm. Dickman upon a charge
: 0 f illegally having in his possession
j a nU mber of beaver hides. He waa
^ bought before Judge Evans on Sat
j ur day f or a hearing, and after plead
j n g I10 t guilty he changed the plea to
j guilty and was senteced to serve six
. mon ths in the cunty jail. After a
severe lecture delivered by Judge Ev
ans he was paroled pending his good
j behavior.
j The arrest 0 f Hart by Deputy
( Game Warden Burke was a very im
por tant one as the beaver in the Por
j supine are not numerous and the law
. nia ki nf r it a crime to trap or kill these
: animals is strictly enforced. A short
time ago reports were made that
SO meone was trapping beaver on the
upper fork of the Porcupine and an
investigation was at once made, by
Mr. Burke. He found sufficient evi
dence to warrant arresting Hart and
assisted by Deputy Dickman the man
was taken and brought to jail. At
y irs ^ jj ar t proclaimed his innocence
a pp eare( j mU c-h incensed at hav
infj been ai . reste d. He plead not
g U ilty and was insistent upon stand
, ^ a ti . ia , but when Game Warden
Burke produced a part of the evi
dence collected he quickly changed
of
at
a
his plea to that of guilty.
Judge Evans then pronounced sen
tence and as Hart appeared to show
the proper realization of the crime
committed he was given a straight
plain talk by the Judge who offered
to give the man a chance if he wanted
it. Hart agreed to lead a law abid
ing life in the future if allowed to
do so and the Judge paroled him.
