FROM THE PEOPLE
Letter from Henry A. Minor.
I have spf nt another hour at the Art
Institute. This time I only reviewed
the statuary which I made the main
object of my former visits, and went
into the department where they had
reproductions ' in miniature of sarco
phagi of long ago dead kings and
queens of France and Spiin and of the
Medici of Venice, and of old cathe
drals. "In miniature" in this connec
tion sometimes means twenty-five
feet high. I saw Rheims Cathedral
though not the west transcript with
th?gveat round window in it we are so
familiar with, but another front. I
saw, too, reproductions of the beauti
ful cathedrals of Beauvais. Limoges
and Aix.
.There was a miniature of the Acro
polis near Athens, and the temple of
: Neptune. They did not have any of
the tomb of Naooleon nor of the Car
nic ruins. One of the finest things I
saw was a bronze mountain lion,
crouching by an American artist.
Things I saw reminded me of friends
in Noxubee. Of course the bust of
Demosthenes reminded me of Hardin
Brooks, and the musical instrument in
Apollo's hands of Max Willisms and
another, gentlemen I won't name lest I
hurt his real estate business. The
statue of Hercules recalled Charlie
Barnes and that of Plato Charlie
Strong with an imagined beard, lsaw
a painting, old Italian,, entitled "Vcne
) tian Ambassador to Abyssinia" and
the ambassador was the spitting image
of Lester Williams. There were other
resemblances, but it would take up too
much of the Beacon's space.
. They say there i3 more traffi: along
Michigan avenue than any other street
in the woild. Certainly automobiles
go by fifteen hours in the day at the
rate of ten a minute. Then just a lit
tle i'lrther over are the Illinois Central
tracks with innumerable trains, local
and interurban as well as ordinary,
and then the lake on which there Is a
constant stream of vessels. It is also
one of the handsomest streets any
where, with great UllbuM.ngs, though
of course Uiov are cva i-l v:s sine oi
the avenue, the other sida fronting the
lake. -
John Sharp Williams came into head
quarters Wednesday. He has been
resting up at some springs since the
adjournment of Congress, but still
looked worn and worked down. How
ever, as soon as he get here we put
him to work and he looked much bet
ter next morning. I interviewed him
on the issue "sectionalism" and sent it
out to the papers. To show you what
a cold deal these Chicago papers give
us, the Tribune gave him six lines, the
Journal twenty and the others none at
all. But a blackmail case can get ten
columns. We sent the interview out
to a good many papers in this and ad
j' ining states. Have not yet received
copies and so can't say how many used
it. I send you a copy of the inter
view. He left yesterday to speak in
Indiana: will go to Michigan and make
many speeches there.
Last night the Iroquois club, a big
Democratic social and political organi
zation here, entertained the heads of
the various uureuus at a big banquet,
about 500 being present. I represented
our bureau. Senators Walsh, Hollis
and Saulsbury spoke and Congressman
Ferris. I wish Brooke could have
, , . ri' i f .t Til:
neara mm. 'nen uov. -uuiin ui Illi
nois, candidate to succeed himeelf,
spoke. Senator Walsh made a magnifi
cent speech; the oihers were all short.
It was mighty pleasant to me as a
Mississippi, and personally, too, so
far as that was concerned, to see how
fond the Washington men are of
Senator Williams. There wa3 some
ting so genuine about their welcome to
him.
Politics. There is a strong belief in
mafiiy' quarters," even in some Democratic-quarters,"
that Hughe3 is going
to be elected. I have tried to dis:ovt r
the grounds for this. Of course in
the majority of cases the thought is
fathered by the wish, In other cases
it ia a natural pessimism in
creased' by the fact that the
Republicans have a tremendous
campaign fund. It is said that their
fund this year makes Mark Ilanna's
fund look like 30 cents. It is realized
that tnis is Bi Business' last stand for
the controlling influence in our national
government. In other cases, and I be
lieve these are by far the most numer
ous, the reason for the belief is this
the country is normally Republican
and it won't be changed this year. To
my mind the main fact is true-the
country is, or has been, normally Re
publican. But this is no normal or or
dinary time, and Wilson is no ordinary
president, The .situation is just the
kind to fool the wise guys, who are
very sharp and keen of vision, but
don't see deep.
Another thing the Democrats have
generally had the election won 30 days
before election day and the Republi
cans on that day. This year it is go
ing to be the other way.
This year is like 1SS4 when Cleve
land beat BlainS. The same sort of
men who left their old parties to sup
port Wilson. Match them up: Har
per's Weekly in 1SS4, the Springfield
Republican in 1916; George William
Curtis-Chas. W. Elliot, President
Emeritus of Harvard; Carl Schurz
Thos. A. Edison, and many others.
Cleveland's Secretary of State OIncy,
ha of the Venezuelan messRge, has
ripped the very skin off Hughes. I
send you my condensation of his arti
cle. Also of President Eliot's.
They are serding all of my stuff now
to all the dailies as well as the week
lies, and once or twice a week I am
getting up things like the Eliot and 01
ney stuff, which is sent to all the
dailies. The other bureaus are just as
active " as ours and if Wilson is not
elected, it won't be from any lack of
hard work in the Western headquart
ers. I sent you a big poster; the only one
sent to Mississippi.
The Labor Question
Editor of the Beacon:
Is it best that the labor leave Noxu
bee county? The writer takes the
negative view.
Lands are utilized in only two ways
as a source of revenue to-wit: Grazed
or tilled. . Wherever grazed there are
wide areas with small populations, as
note South America and the West.
Where the lands are farmed it
means thickly settled districts in pro
portion to productivity; high prosperity
values, the rapid interchange of com
merce, in short, commerce. People
in numbers in a community according
to their energy and intelligence, sur
rounded with an average condition of
natural resources, make the standard
of wealth high, and business abounds;
excepting of course failures which
have only temporary influence. If the
above is true, viz: The presence of
people make hi lnd value, then
the converse is unavoidable, viz: The
scarcity of people in a community
make low land values and small busi
ness. Wherever population is heaviest as
instanced by cities, land values are
highest. We are losing our popula
tion, shall we make not (Tort to retain
it? And it is the most important part of
our population when viewed from an
economic point, as they are the pro
ducersthe laborers, both white and
black.
Go into communities where the boll
weevil devastation (such as is now be
ing experienced by Noxubee) dro e
out labor, and land owners, merchants,
in fact all citizens will tell you that
nothing has brought the loss to them
so much as the departure of their
labor.
There are manv citizens merchants,
farmers and others who can divide this
loss with the laborer, by being willing,
we'll say, to lose the pofits for this
year, and by various schemes, (such as
inducing the man of the family to ga
out and get work by cotton picking in
other sections work, at sawmills or on
good roadsr-'tiJl the 1st of January,
the proceeds of which if wisely ap
plied would meet many needs) and in
this way tide over another year.
As our friend suggested, this must
be worked out by the different indi
vidual cases.
The point I wish to stress is, do net
permit the chance to cash in the in
debtedness of the laborer, and thereby
lose his services by allowing him to go
out of the county without some calcu
lation of this loss to you and a willing
ness on your part to stand s.me of it
to retain him. '
What is meart by "cashing in" is
say a family owes one, two or three
hundred dollars, and the labor agen:
pays the debt and takes the hand to
th2 Delta or some other section, can
we afford it fur the sake of the ready
cash in pyery instance?
As a concrete illustration of what
is meant by "sharing the loss." Say
the debt is one hundred dollars for
man and wife or for mule, and your
profit in this is twenty-five dollars or
even thirty dollars. Is it not far bet
ter to giv this profit up as lost and
even a part of the remaining seventy
dollars, rather than that your farm
should do without the Btrvices of this
laborer for years possibly for life?
It is not an answer to say you'll get
more labor if your3 leave, for where
there is a shortage some one is hit,
and it may be you.
If you happen to be a merchant, then
his presence in the county increases,
just that far, vour chances for sales.
In gime instances doubtless, the
debt and the condition of the creditors
is such as would make impossible to do
other than to "cash in" and let the
laborer go.
These suggestions and reflections
are given because in them is involved
the most important question in our im
medate future, and should not be
passed over without regard.
A word to the colored laborer: Re
member, when you go to the Delta (as
that is where most of jou are looking)
there are many little privileges and
enjoyments left behind. Few colored
families are so situated as to have
cows. Your church ndvantages are
not what t 'ey are here. You are in
most instances driven harder than
here. Your health nothing like so
good there as here.
These conditions are not universally
the case but they prevail in the ma
jority of cases. Some colored people
in the Delta have many pleasant and
convenient home surroundings but it
is not the rule. Again, you will find it
a little more difficult to return, should
you want to than yoa found it going
from here there those white people
know the value of labor, and do not
give it up without protest.
It is up to the colored farmers and
tenants and the white land owners and
farmers to make some sacrifices that
we may pass over the temporary crop
shortage. Are we willing to do it?
J. Q. POINDEXTER.
To the Ladies, Girls and Teachers of
Noxubee County
The supervisors of Noxubee county
have made provision for the Home
Science branch of the extension work,
which is now growing so rapidly in the
south, and have agreed to accept my
services as County Agent or Demon
strator. I take this means of announc
ing to all those who are interested in
the .work that I want to visit all com
munities and schools and present the
Canning Club work for the girls and
the home demonstration work for the
ladies just as soon as it is possible for
me to do so and at a convenient time
for them.
On my first visit to each school I
l.houk' lja glau to have as many ladies
present as posaiolo, as it wilt be
through their co-oseration and that of
the teacher that I will be able to in
terest the girls, organize them into
tomato canning clubs, co-operative
poultry clubs, etc. I shall be at the
Court house in Macon on Tuesdays and
Saturdays of each week and mail can
reach me there on thoss dates or at
llrooksville and I shall appreciate very
much if the teachers who want me to
visit their schools will advise me to
that effect, because there are so many
schools that want the help, are eager
for it a. id asking for it and of course 1
want to go where I am most wanted
and needed.
Besides what help I can give you we
have the A. & M. college to call upon
and they are glad and willing to send
us competent people to demonstrate
fully any ph'ise of the work at any
time.
My work is under the leadership .and
supervision of Miss Susie V. Powell,
who is employed by the government
and who is willing at all times to help
us.
This work i3 rapidly growing in Miss
issippi. It has been organized in our
state only five years and began with a
few counties; now something like forty
counties are actually engaged in it.
We want to make it a success in Noxu
bee and I need the help of everybody,
the business men as well as the teach
ers, ladies and girls and I urge all to
lend helping hands and lot's by co-operation
make tne home economics work
in our county compare favorably with
that of any other county in Mississ
ippi. Sincerely yours,
Annetu: Smyth Tynimli.,
County Agent Home E:ono:Dics.
Warning to Auto Drivers
Illinois Central Railroad Co., the
Yazoo & Mississippi Valley Railroad
Co.
To Those who Drive or ride in Auto
mobiles: The constantly increasing number of
automobile accidents at grade cross
ings prompts the issuance of this warn
ing to all who own, drive or ride in
automobiles to Stop, Look and Listen
before passing over any railway grade
crossing.
Crossing gates, automatic warning
bells, electric hesdlights and engine
signals, it not heeded by those for
whose protection they are intended,
ate unavailing.
I will be glad to receive and consid
er suggestions intended to reduce auto
mobile accidet3 at grade crossings,
for the railroad is anxious to do it3
own part. However, if every person
who owns, drives or ridea in an auto-

Fire Prevention Day
Jackson, Miss., Oct. 1. In calling
attention to the great movement to pro
mote fire prevention in Mississippi ai d
issuing an official proclamation or re
minder of the day and the idea, desig
nating Monday, Oct. 7 as fire preven
tion iUy, Gov. Bilbo issues the follow
ing suggestions for proper observance :
"1 would ask that on that dc.y all
public buildings, factories and homes
be thoroughly cleansed of rubbish; that
all boating, lighting and fire extin
guishing apparatus be examined, and if
found defective, promptly repaired;
that fire drills be held in all schools,
factories and other places where such
drill i are established, that Lctures be
given in our public schools by rcpre
senUtivis of fire departments on com
mon fire hazards, and where such offi
cials cannot be secured, then that
the teachers give such instruction as
they can on the Bubject. There is no
doubt that our annual fire loss can be
largely reduced and our resouices
greatly conserved if our people will
give that thoughtful study to the sub
ject, which its importance deserves."
N.itutally, the fire underwriters are
with the governor on this proposition
and will do all in their power to make
"Fire Prevention Day" count for some
thing beyond mere words and phrases.
Let every one of our citizens read
this proclamation over carefully and
see if any of the above mentioned sug
gestions apply tD their property and if
so get busy and have them attended to
before it is too late. Have your chim
nejs thoroughly cleaned out, look at
your kitchen Huts and all electric wir
ing, as these two items cause' more
fires than any other that you can think
of and are the most neglected.
Respectfully,
JAMES G. IIORTON,
Mayor.
TOM T. PATTY,
Chief Fire Dept.
When you find a farm where the boy
owns the calves, colts, pigs and Iambi,
but the father owns the cows, horses,
hogs and sheep, you have found a farm
from which a boy is going to the city
pretty aoon.

Orphans Find Horn
Miss Emma Purser of Jackson was in
town the first of the week and took to
Jackson the ten orphan children that
have been in charge of Mrs. McCoIIum
for several weeics past. Miss Purser
is diatrict agent for northoast Mississ
ipni of the Children's Home Society,
an elemosynary institute that was es
tablished in the state five years ago,
and to date has found homes for COO
orphan children. They have no asylum
but find homes for unfortunate chil
dren and it is Miss Purser's duty to
travel over the state and see that chil
dren the society has disposed of, arc
properly cared for. Under a law passed
by the last legislature, the board of
supervisors now in session, appropri
ated the Bum of $500 to pay for the
care of the ten orphans
Miss Purser wishes through the
Beacon to extend thankB to the board
and to the people of Macon for the uni
versal kindness shown her and the in
stitution she represents. Mrs. McCoI
Ium for the children, wish to extend
sincere thanks to the ladies of Macon
for many acts of kindness exterded
the children while under her care.
Concrete Floors ray First Cost In Ons
Year
Do you know that concrete floon
placed in your stables or feeding bam
will pay for themselves through the
manure that they save in less than one
year? Results recently published ty
the Ohio Fxperiment station show
that the manure from a lot of feeding;
rattle was worth 11.58 more per stee
for one year where the cattle wero
kept on concrete floors than whero
stabled on dirt floors.
Allowing 41) square feet for each
steer an 1 estimating the cost of the
concrete at 8 cents per square foot,
the cost of the floor would be $3.2')
per steer. This would leave a prof t
for the first year of $1 38 or a return
of more than 40 per cent profit. In ad
dition the sanitary conditions of the
stable would be more ideal and th.
labor required to remove the manure
much less. Progressive Farmer.
