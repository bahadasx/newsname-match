The rush for reservations was a re
sult of a new system made necessary
this year, I'resldcnt J. J. L.-innln or
the lioston Americans explained, be
cause of the late date upon which tho
American league race wns decided.
Hy this system successful applicants

other years. Those first In lino ob
tained the better seats.
Many Are Disappointed.
In all proUibillty club officials
npTeo more persons havo been disap

tickets this year than ever before.
Hundreds of lequests have been re

fusals was shown In the statement to

caused IS letters to bo written each
