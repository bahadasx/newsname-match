' fiftieth anniversary, thousands of peo
ple from nearby cities and states
packed Omaha's streets and shouted j
enthusiastically every time Mr. Wilson

political advisors were apparently well
pleased with their reception.
Republicans in Line.
Omaha was in gala attire for the day.
The celebration was non partisan in j
character and arranged by a commis
sion made up largely t Republicans.
Three Speeches.
The President was received by a
roar of cheering from the assemblage
which packed the Omaha Auditorium
tonight.
For several minutes there were such
calls as :"Vho kept us out of war
Wilson." "Who prevented the strike
Wilson." "Wirt) saved the nation
Wilson."
Governor Morehead of Nebraska in

The President was interrupted by
applause and shouts of "we thank
you."
Why We're at Peace.
The causes of the European war, he
said, are not plainly, known.
"But Europe should understand us." j
he said. "We are holding off because j
when we use the forces of this nation ;
we want to know what we are using
it for."
Plenty of Fipht in U. S.
"There is as much fight in America
as in any nation in the world. !
"We want always to hold the forces '
of America to fight for the rights of
mankind, not for the rights of proper- j
ty. But in fighting for these things
we sWJuld know what the touchstone
is. We must have absolutely allegi
ance to America. We must be truly
American. The riehts of humanity
are the essence of freedom.
The Cause of War. !
"We want all the world to know j
that we are ready to use all our force j
to maintain peace among mankind. '
The starting of wars can never again j
be the private concern of anv one
natron. We must use all our forces,
moral and physical to uphold a league
of nations, to uphold the peace of this
world."
The President declared there was
no ouestlon of fighting over petty
things. He discussed the address of .
Washington on entangling alliences,
saying he did not believe Washington
meant the United States should not
come into contact with the: world.
Business Turned Free.
President Wilson in his afternoon !
pneech here, declares the "real bni- !
ness of legislation Is to release the
forces of America's business and to '
see to It that impediments new or old

,By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Oct. 5. Denunciation
of the foreign policies and the tarift
and national defense measures of the
Democratic administration and a plea
for an awakening of the "spirit that
bore up our fathers in the struggle,"
marked a political speech delivered
here tonight at Carnegie Hall by
Elihu Root He said in part:
"We are told that Mr. Wilson has
kept the country out of war. So has
every president for seventy-eight years
except Lincoln and McKinley. Never
since Columbus sighted San Salvador
has there been a time when it has been
so easy for America to keep out of
war by doing nothing. No country
has been willing to incur even our
passive hostility and throws to her
enemies the benefits of Our material
and moral support.
Danger After War.
"Our danger is later when peace
has been made and the great armies
are free and rulers and governments
look about for ways to repair their
losses. Then will come the pressure
of keeping back by force in these con
tinents where the wealth of the world
is concentrating. Then must be de
termined whether the Monroe Doctrine
is to be surrendered as an idle boast.
"Peace is not maintained by the
surrender of just results, for the pre
sumption of impunity begotten by
weak submission to aggression breeds
still further aggression. Peace is
maintained by the assertion of just
rights, dispassionately accompanied by
knowledge of power behind the as
sertion. Wilson's Three Failures.
"The Wilson administration has
failed in three facts of importance and
has showed itself incompetent That
is the judgment of the world. The
three are the murder of our citizens
on the Lusitania, the preparation of
military and naval forces for national
defense and the failure in Mexico.
Mexico.
Of the Mexican situation Mr. Root
said:
"Proclaming impartiality and re
spect for the rights of Mexico Presi
dent Wilson interfered in the civil
controversy in Mexico and finally in
tervened by force of arms and de
troyed one party and aided the other
party and overthrew Huerta and
set up Carranza and Villa in the seat
of government He has maintained
with such skill that no man in Mexico
dares call himself our friend.
"The question of the American peo
ple is: 'Are they willing to have their
vital affairs during the next four years
conducted in the same way the Mexi
can business has been conducted?'"
The Tariff.
The speaker then turned to the
tariff saying:
"Our market has always been at
tractive to European producers. It
will be far more attractive after the
war. We must protert ourselves or
we shall beme the dumping ground !

with the police late this
afternoon in the most serious
riot since the walkout on the trac

sticks were swung right and left
by the police, and many of the
women were bruissd. Scores of
the rioters carried babies in their
arms.
MOB DISPERSED.
A Crowd of strikers entered
the fray on the side of the women
and was driving back the few
patrolmen on the scene when an
ambulance load of police reinforce
ments arrived. The reserves
plunged into the midst of the
struggling mob and wielded their
clubs without mercy. When the
rioters finally fled they left nine
prisoners six women and three
men in the hands of the police.

Great Cunard Steamship
Is Torpedoed and Sunk By
"Sub" In Mediterranean
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Oct. 5. The admiral
ty announces that the Cunard .
steamer Franconia, employed for
transport duty, was sunk in the
Mediterranean yesterday by an
enemy submarine. The steamer
had no troops aboard. Twelve men
of the crew of 402 are missing.
Was 18,500 Ton Ship
According to the latest available re
ports the Franconia was a vessel of
18,500 tons gross and was built in
1910. Her maiden voyage was be
tween Liverpool and Uoston in Febru
ary, 1911.
The Franconia was 425 feet long,
72 feet wide and displaced 25,000 tons.
Who Would Stop His Statement
speaking very briefly of several other
phases of the situation, Campbell was
interrupted several times by allusions
to his actions in Bisbee some weeks
ago when he ate breakfast in the Eng
glish Kitchen, on Main Street In
spite of these, however, he nade sev
eral telling points, among them being
what he termed the increased cost of
government in the state of Arizona
during the past five years.
"The cost or your government in the
state of Arizona has increased :!)
percent in the last live years." declar
ed the speaker. "If the government
is that much better, at the present
time, than it was before, then you
can declare a preferred dividend. If
it is not, you are being cheated and
I feel that you are being cheated."
Getting into the English Kitchen af
fair, the name of Governor Hunt was
spoken, and it caused considerable!
applause from various parts of the
house.
"I am glad to hear you applaud h:s
excellency." saiil I'amprell. "I am
more than glad that he has frii-nds

The vessel was nicknamed the

"Did you ever hear of George Hunt

asked Campbell. "I have been Inform

Police On The Jump
No actual disorder developed but
the nolice were called UDon to reform
I lines, and club employes endeavored
j to placate disappointed applicants
who clamored for answers to their
written requests for seats.
The rush for reservations was a re
sult of a new system, made necessary
this year. President J. J. Lannin of
the Boston Americans explained, be
cause of the late date at which the
American league decision was decided
The applicants were assigned a num
ber calling for tickets of a certain
class, without a definite designalion
of the seats as in other years. Those
first in line obtained the better seats
as they were distributed by the tic
ket sellers, and It was to obtain these
that applicants sought the leading
places in the lines.
Dead Heads Denied
In all probability, club officials
agree, more persons have been dis
appointed through failure to receive
tickets this year than ever before.
Hundreds of requests have been re
fused. Scalpers Active
The police patrol of the ticket lines
Is rigorous, and those soliciting or
selling tickets are first warned away
and then arrested if they persist. One
arrest was made today. Private detec
tives are said to be in touch with the
distribution of large blocks of seats
furnished to municipal officials, the
polico and fire departments, and va
rious public service companies, to be
certain that none of these blocks is
turned to private profit.
Because, of their delay In obtaining
world's series tickets, some of the
players missed a train for Worcester,
where part of the team played an ex

Americans. Others delayed their ap
