FOR PRIMARY CLIMAX
Candidates Visit Kalaupapa Attempt To Get Indivi
dual Attention Sampans Used For Voyage-
Inmates Enjoyed Speeches Sheriff's Office To
Receive Returns
Primary election returns will be re
ceived and bulletined at the Wailuku
police station tomorrow evening from
5 o'clock until all the returns which
can be secured have been received.
For the purpose of permitting all In
terested to get the returns as quickly
as possible, a blackboard with the
names of the candidates and different
precincts has been erected in the hall
way of the police station, where the
sheriff and his assistants will mark the
results as they come In.
It is expected, as the ballot is short,
thRt most of the returns will be receiv
ed by 8 or 9 o'clock. Of course It will
be impossible to get the result of the
voting on Molokal and Lanal until
later.
The general public will be welcome
to come to the police station to learn
the results of the voting, but telepone
inquiries will not be answered, except
for those sending In returns.
In the last week of the primary
campaign, Molokal, or rather the Kala
upapa Settlement, has been the pivo
tal point of all the candidates. Of
all the sixteen Republican candidates
there are only two or three who did
not visit the settlement in order to
try and secure the support of the vot
ers there. So close Is the contest be
tween some of the representative can
didates that the balloting of the inma
tes of the settlement will be the de.
elding factor in the contests.
Now on the last day of the campaign
the candidates are telling among
themselves how they scored a victory
in Kalaupapa. It was announced last
week that the candidates would all
visit the settlement this week by the
Mikahala. But it 'was an agreement
with a whispered proviso, to hear the
opponents explain It. Early in the
week some of the candidates realized
that with so many Intending to go on
the one date there would be little
time for the campaigning of each, so
some of the wise ones made quick ar

Next Week
With four submarines there and
two ships of the United
States navy acting as parent
ships for the undersea craft,
Lahaina has been an active place dur
ing the past week. The fleet consist
ing of the K 3, 4, 7, and 8 and the
cruiser St. Louis and Alert with about
400 men arrived In Lahaina early in
the week and the submarine crews im
mediately began torpedo battle pract
ise, much to the interest of the Lahai
na people, and others who have gone
from central Maui to watch the work
of the sailors.
The St. Louia is acting as tender for
the K-3 and the K-4 and the Alert for
the K-7 and K-8. The target practise
is held along the coast between Olawa
lu and Kaanapall. Three life boats,
150 feet apart, are trailed along be
hind the tenders and in the center of
the life boats there is a large canvass
target at which the torpedoes are dir
ected, after the submarines are sub

' v On Wednesday evening, Major
Toung, acting commander of the 3rd
Militia regiment, made an official call
on Commander Hart, who is in charge
of the submarine flotilla and tenders.
On next Tuesday night Mr. and Mrs.
Young will entertain the fourteen offic
ers of the fleet at a dinner at their
home.
Commander Hart has announced
that the submarines and the ships will
be open to inspection of the Maui
public on next Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday and Saturday between 2 and
6 o'clock in the afternoon. Everyone
will be welcome to visit the ships on
these days and on the hours announc
ed. A week from tomorrow night a
dance is to be given in the Lahaina
Armory in honor of the visiting offic
ers to which the public will be gener
ally invited.
An attempt is being made to get
up a ball game between the Lahaina
nine and the crack team of the fleet
for next Sunday afternoon.
The fleet will remain at Lahaina
until a week from Sunday.

Tuesday by sampan:
The first ones left the settlement
content with their laborers. Then the
Mikahala made its mid-week visit,
and there were less less thnn four of
the candidates who had stuck to their
original intention. Those who did
not goin the week or during the m'ddle
of the week made their visit yester
day or today.
A'l the candidates think they have
gained on advantage over their opp
onents. They believe they had theadvan
tage of making first, second or last
impression on the Inmates. But the
ordinary voters just laughs, for he
knows that the beliefs of most of the
candidates are Just the "father of
their wishes." As to the lepers, no
one knows how they will vote today.
The only thing certain is that they
have enjoyed nothing so much as they
did the campaign speeches, since the
first moving picture was exhibited in
Kalaupapa.
Predictions as to the outcome of
the contest among the Republican
candidates for nomination as repre
sentatives, the only contests outs'de
of the delegate race, are varied and
according to the hopes of the man
speaking.
Manuel Paschoal of Puunene Is said
to be certain of election and J. J.

Pauwela Postoffice
Is Short $812
Inspector Flavin Verifies Report That
Postmaster Kaloa's Accounts
Are Under Investigation
Definite vertiflcatlon of the
statement that Nelson Kaloa,
postmaster at Pauwela, Is under
investigation for a shortage of
over $800 was given in Honolulu
this week by Postal Inspector
Thomas Flavin. The United
States attorney also stated that
a report of the shortage had
been made to his office and that
: the matter would be placed be
fore the federal grand Jury when
it meets on next Monday.
Knowledge that there was a
shortage in the Pauwela office
has been known to a few on Ma
ul since last Saturday, when In
spector Flavin completed an in
vestigation of the books of that
office. After his investigation
he ordered the office c'osed and
transferred the postofDce to Ha
iku. He took a part of the of
fice books to Honolulu for
further investigation and evid
ence before the grand Jury. The
balance of the books, with the
stock, were left with the Haiku
postmaster.
Flavin stated In Honolulu that
the shortage in the Pauwela offi
ce was $812, but no particulars
as to what funds the money was
taken from have given out.
No arrests in connection with
the Pauwela postoffice shortage
have been made. Kaloa is now
staying at Pnla. This is the
second postoffice Bhortago on
this island in recent months.
Morris Keohokalole, the Paia
postmaster, is now out on bonds
on a charge of having embezzled
$1800from money orders in the
Paia postoffice.
Dance And Swim
Meet Promising
Much interest is being displayed in
the swimming meet and dance which
is' to be held at the Alexander House
Settlement tomorrow evening. The
boys who are to take part In the swim
ming contests have been practising
every day during the past week and
are showing a fine quality. "They will
be hard to beat," their backers decl
are. The girls also have an exceptional
fine team, and if Paia is to win either
by match it must have some very fast
swimmers. Observations of experts,
point to the decision that there will be'
a very close match.
The events for boys are as follows:
100-foot sprint; 50-foot sprint; 50-foot
back stroke; 100-foot relay; three
dives, swan, back and choice. The
girls' events will be the same, except
that there will be no relay race.

Every building on Market street

and main structure of the Alexander
House Settlement, the Chinese church
and the store house of the Howell
Engineering Company, may be used
for the more valuable exhibits of the

After the buildings' are secured, the
extension to Market street, leading
irom mauka to the base ball grounds,
will also be enclosed and likely used
as the location for the various "fun
making" concessions of the fair.
Enthusiasm in the fair seems to be
mounting, instead of waning, with the
extra amount of work on the commit
tees which daily becomes more evid
ent. There has not been a day this
week when there has not been a meet
ing of one or more of the committees
in Wailuku.
Acting on a suggestion made at the
general committee meeting of the fair
last Monday, an "executive committee
of the executive committee of the
fair" was appointed consisting of five
members. The officers and two others
constitute this committee. This com
mittee will meet the other committee
men daily until the fair is over. Five
meetings in all have so far been held
this week.
At the general committee meeting,
the resignation of F. A. Clowes as
chairman of the committe on prize
awards was accepted and L. R. Math
ews named lo succeed him. The school
dut'es of Mr. Clowes prevented him
from devoting as much time ar. nec
essary to the work of the fair, accord

Cruiser St Louis
Drifting upon the rocks in a
calm while the skipper and crew
were powerless to do anything
to keep the vessel afloat the sch
ooner Muriel went ashore yester
day afternoon at 3 o'clock at
Napili, about four miles from Ka
nanpall. The schooner was in
near shore when the wind died
down and left the vessel to be
washed ashore by the big com
bers. A wireless call was immediate
ly sent out for assistance t the
United States ships which are
at Lahaina and the crusier St.
Louis responded fo the S. O. S.
The St. Louis reached the Muriel
too late to be of any assistance
last night, but stood by until
morning in order to save the
crew with life boats if any lives
should be endangered by a sud
1 den storm. In the morning the
schooner was pulled from the
rocks and towed to Kaanapall by
the lighthouse tender.
The last reports from Kaa
napall states that the damage to
the ship was slight and that it
is making only about two inches
of water an hour as the result
of ifs berth on the rocks for
fourteen hours.
One report, unverified, is that
the schooner crew got the vessel
off the rocks without the assis
tance of the St. Louis or the
lighthouse tender.
The Muriel was loaded with
a cargo of lumber from Pueet
Sound for the Pioneer Mill Com
pany. The vessel is owned by
the Hixid-Rolph Company.

FAILURE OF LIGHT IS DUE
TO UNAVOIDABLE ACCIDENT
According to J. C. Blair, the super
intendent of the Inter-Island Electric
Company, the going out of the lights
all ever Wailuku last night was due
to an unavoidable accident. He says
that a valve spring broke and "killed"
the plant, until an auxiliary unit could
be started up. The resumption of the
service was made in fifteen minutes,
which he considers very fast work on
the part of his employees." Accidents
happen on steamships and railroads,
in spite of all the modern Improve
ments. That was our misfortune last
night," he explains.

Wounded Man
Tells Of War
Brother Of Frank Peacock Writes In
teresting Letter Of Operations In
France, But Say Little About How
He Received Gunshot
Breathing confidence of an eventual
British victory in almost every line,
Jack Peacock, who was wounded In
France, has written a letter to his
brother, Frank Peacock of Puunene,
from a hospital in England where he is
convalescing.
While the letter is fifed with praise
of the bravery of others, and although
it is a long intimate one of the nature
which one brother might be expected
to write another, it is Blngularly lack
ing in details as to how the brother
of the Puunene man got his wound.
The only reference to the wound Is the
statement that he is in a hospital, and
then these unboastful words:
"I was wounded in the attack on
Qozieres in the shoulder, but am glad
it's nothing serious." In the several
hundred words of the letter that Is the
only statement made regarding the
wound received by young Peacock.
Continuing he says: "Our boys did
some good work there, but our losses
were heavy, still nothing to what Fritz
lost.
"I never saw such bombardments
since 1 have been on active
service. Fricourt, La Boisette
and all all those towns are
nothing but big heaps of dirt, with
hardly anything standing. So fierce
was the fire of the British artillery,
the earth fairly rocked from the con
cussions. We are getting the upper
hand now, and we our gradually push
ing h'm (Fritz) back, but this is only
the start and nothing to what he is go
ing to get.
"Germans gave themselves up when
we adanced, some of them almost in
sane, they say. Our artillery fire is so
terrible that it simply batters down
the opposition. I can assure you that
It is a sight one won't forget in a hur
ry. The Germans received orders to
retake Qozieres at all costs and they
attacked, wave after wave of them,
but our curtain fire mowed them down
and their attacks withered away. I
am satisfied that man to man the Ger
man is not so good as the soldiers of
the Brftish Empire and it was only
thetr overwhelming superiority at the
start in guns and men that allowed
them to advance at all.
"We have the men, guns and the
money now; also the absolute mas
tery of the air. I saw sixty-three of
our battle-planes go on bombing raid.
It was a sight well worth seeing. The
prettiest sight I saw at Messines was
when our planes brought downeight Ger
man ballons in flames. Our airmen
are about the gamest men on earth."
Peacock closes his letter with the
statement that he Is to have a chance
to visit his home the following day.
He expresses the hope that he will be
able to pass by the Hawaiian Islands
oi his way to Australia after the war
Is over.
Although Peacock's letter had been
examined by the censor, the only word
In which it appeared there had been
an effort to delete was the name of a
hospital in France, to which he was
sent just after being wounded. Names
of towns in France around which he
had been fighting and also of different
localities in England were untouched.
VON TEMPSKY HAS ACCIDENT
Louis von Tempsky received a pain
ful but not exceedingly serious injury
last Friday night when a horse which
he was riding fell upon him and hurt
his left shoulder. The accident prev
ented him from going to Honolulu
where he had been called as a witness
before the public utilities commission.
The hearing has been postponed until
he is able to attend.
