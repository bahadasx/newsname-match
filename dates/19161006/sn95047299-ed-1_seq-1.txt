PARTYLESS " MEN II
BECOME CANDIDATES
i n
In Approaching General
Election On Ticket by.
Petition.
Tl 1 I i-ii i i i i
I me laws oi norma proviue tnat a
man can become a candidate for pub-
j lie office and get his name on the tick
et at a general election on presenta
tion of a petition signed by a certain
number of electors. For a county of
fice the candidate must have 25 names
on his petition. For a State office
the law requires that at least BOO
names must be attached to the peti
tion. On Wednesday the board of county
commissioners was busy with these
petitions of independent candidates, as
well as of those which were of party
men who had become candidates after
I the primary because of the removal
i from the county of the regular candi-
date, or to fill vacancies on the ticket
; occasioned through the failure of can
j didates to properly qualify.
I In the latter class were at least
j three of the Florida presidential elec
' tors for the democratic party. These
i were named at the recent meeting of
the btate Democratic Executive Com
mittee in Jacksonville, and a petition
containing more than 500 names was
presented to the board by W. A. Rus
sell, member of the State Committee.
By resolutio of the board these names
will have a place on the ticket.
Rev. Sidney J. Catts, aware that
his name is now "Mud" in so far as
the democratic nomination is concern
ed, is qualifying in each county of the
State as an independent candidate for
governor. His petition, signed in Du
val county was received by regis
tered letter from the "Catts Club"
of Duval county and was duly
presented to the board, and of course
received favorable action.
Chas. T. Clark, socialist for repre
sentative in the legislature; E. Loom
is, socialist, candidate for justice of
the peace in district No. 8; L. L.
Moody, independent candidate for
county commissioner from the sec
ond, or Palatka, district; J. F. Da
vidson, independent candidate for
sheriff; H. S. Bennett, independent
candidate also for sheriff, and Henry
Hutchinson, independent candidate for
clerk of the court, were all acted on
favorably as they each had legal pe
titions. F. V. Owen of Satsuma Hights
and W. F. Rogero, will by petition,
be opposing democratic candidates for
member of the county school board
from district No. 1. Dr. Main of
Welaka who was the nominee of the
June democratic primary, has moved
from the State, and the place on the
ticket had to be filled. Messrs. Ow
en and Rogers are both democrats,
and neither can be considered as in
dependent of party action as no par
ty action has been taken in either
case.
Henry Hutchinson for clerk was de
feated in the primary by R. J. Han
cock; ho believes that in the cam
paign unfair advantage was taken of
him and that in this work the cor
rupt practice act of the State was
violated. It is his intention to bring
this matter before the attention of
the court at its next meeting. If he
does not prove his case, it is whis
pered he will withdraw, though Mr.
Hutchinson himself does not promise
this.
There is a peculiar circumstance
regarding the strictly socialistic and
independent candidates above noted,
their petitions are signed by practi
cally the same set of men, and these
are' well-known socialists and Catts
Club men here. E. E. Dodge, C. A.
LeHurdy, E. Madison, J. A. Austin,
E. T. Lancaster, A. C. Lancaster, E.
0. Earls, W. W. Waters, E. Loomis,
are names that are attached to a num
ber of the petitions.
Later in the day E. J. Price quali
fied a's an independent candidate for
County Commissioner from the
Fourth district.
TAHPA HARDH
ASTOUHDEDAT CROPS
Of Corn Witnessed in a Trip
Through Marion and Put
nam Counties.
W. S. Thomas of the Tampa Hard
ware Company while in Plant City tKis
week spoke to the people of that place
of an auto trip he had just taken
through the state, and a telegram
to the Ocala Banner tells of his ob
servations as follows:
! "A man who has not been over the
j State can form no conception of what
is being done in the way of develop-
! ment of Florida's possibilities so far
; as agriculture is concerned, said he.
j Mr. Thomas stated that his itiner
ary carried him up through the cen
tral sections, along the east coast
in tact, pretty much over the penin
sula and a large part of the main
land. In Hernando county, not far
from Hillsborough, he saw two hun
dred acres of rice under one fence.
This was enough to put one thinking,
but when the Tampa man reached Ma
rion county, one of the principal sta
ple crop counties of the state, he had
his "eyes opened" sure enough, for
there he ran across a corn field a
thousand acres in extent. Of course,
this was one of the largest single
patches in that section, but the fact
that he was informed the yield would
be considered far too low if it fell
below one hundred and forty bushels
to the acre, Mr. Thomas began to re
alize that there is something to Flori
da's claims as an agricultural coun
try. A little further on, over in Put
nam county, Mr. Thomas came to an
other field of corn; it was not near
so large as the thousand acre patch,
but embraced upwards of two hundred
acres, and gave promise of at least
one hundred and fifty bushels to the
acre.
Several farmers in the vicinity of
Gainesville, in Alachua county, by fol
lowing the rules laid down by the fed
eral government, have secured yields
of more than one hundred bushels to
the acre, and this without the use of
fertilizer.
A Man Without a Party.
Mr. C. A. Lellardy has severed his
relations with the Socialist party in
Putnam county. He. also told The
v.s thnt at the meeting next month
of the Socialist State Committee, of
which he is a member, he would with
draw from membership in the com
mittee. ,
Mr. Lellardy says he is withdraw
ing from socialism, and that until the
books are reopened for registration in
the next primary he will be a man
without a party. At that registra
tion he will declare mmseu. L,enar
dy is a democrat he couldn't be any
thin olao lnnc if he tried. His
principles are all democratic a little
in advance ot party pronouncements,
perhaps, but still nemocraiic m mai,
he believes implicitly in the rule of
the people.
It is understood also that Horn.
Madison has withdrawn from the lo
cal social organization, though it is
not known whether or not, like Mr.
LeHardv, he proposes to cut away
from political affiliation with them al
together. .
with thoco men. the brains of the
organization gone, socialism in Palat
ka finds itselt at a low euu. mi.

A Beautiful Store.
The new store of the Palatka Sta
tionery Co. was opened to the public
last Monday morning, and hundreds
have paid a visit to it, all delighted
with its up-to-dateness and the well
displayed novelties with which the
store abounds. Only a small por
tion of the expected stock is on dis
play, but there is enough to give one
"n idea of what a really delightful
store this is to be. Mr. Fred Coch
rane is to be the manager, and his
lister, Miss Helen Cochrane will as
sist. These popular young people
will dray a large trade.

With the going down of the sun to
night will begin the Day of Atone
ment in the Jewish calendar, and all
the Jewish people will observe the day
as a time of fasting and prayer. The
day ends at sundown on Saturday.
M. S. Brown and Leo Jacobson will
be among the merchants of this city
to observe the day, and this they will
do by closing their places of business
and keeping them closed until Satur
day evening. Fruchtman Bros., of the
new store, "The Fashion," will also be
among those who will do no work dur
ing these hours. Other Jewish mer
chants in the city also will refrain
from business occupations.
Woman's Missionary Society.
The Woman's Missionary Society of
the First Baptist church will have its
regular meeting next Tuesday, Octo
ber 10th at 3 p. m., at the church,
when the subject for the day will be
"Present World Opportunities and

World;" Song: "Lord, Speak to me
that I May Speak;" Prayer; Dismissal.
At a recess meeting of the city
council held on Wednesday night $500
was appropriated for the purpose of
entertaining the convention of the
Farmers Hiducational and Co-operative
Union of America which is to
meet in Palatka late in November.
Mr. M. P, Walsh of the Palatka
board of trade appeared before the
meeting of the council on Tuesday
night and addressed the council on the
importance of this matter. A com
mittee was appointed to confer with
the board of trade committee and a
conference of the two committees re
sulted in an agreement by the coun
cil committee to recommend the ap
propriation.
The council is just now agitated
over the budget and matters attecting
it were discussed. Alderman Jar
rett, head of the finance committee is
worried; he don't want the city ex
pense to run so high and he is trying
to effect the adoption of some econo
mizing measures. . His committee
wanted a little more time, and a re
cess was taken until next Tuesday
night when it is expected his com
mittee will be ready with its final re
port. Alderman McNally has a scheme to
put an end to the further softening
of the city water, which he main
tains is costing the city too much
money. Mr. McNally submitted
some figures showing the cost of
maintainence of the water works to
be greatly in excess of its revenue
too great to make a continuance of
the softening plant practicable or
possible.
But his figures were ridiculed as
unfair both by Aldermen Gay and
Jarret. And Mr. McNally's resolu
tion to discontinue the softening pro
cess was voted down, or rather was
rejected a substitute, to a committee
for enquiry.
Mr. McNally's financial showing
was suppressed by request of Alder
man Jarrett as misleading and prej
udicial. The News has seen a copy of the
financial showing presented by Alder
man McNally, and can bear out Al
derman Jarrett's contention, that if
is misleading. Some of these items
to the debit of the water, works have
no more place there than they would
in a statement showing the expense
of the publicity department of the lo
cal Catts Club, or as a contribution
from the Church of the Inaccurate
Deception to the cause, of foreign mis
sions. Alderman McNally in an interview
with The News said that he does not
want to ruin the old water works,
but that it is a losing proposition and
he Wants to cut out a large part of
the loss. He believes the softening
process now invogue Is costing too
much money and he favors getting a
high priced chemist on the ground to
point out if possible a way of saving
money on treating the water. Al
derman McNally uses the water and
tenants over whom he has supervis
ion as manager of properties, are
using it in fact a big part of pri
vate water takers who use the city
water are using it .because of his
choice, and any intimation that he is
trying to injure the water works, is
to say the least far-fetched.
"THE FASHION" TO
Magnificent Display of
Women's Garments To
Be Shown.
Palatka's magnificent new store,
"The Fashion," under the manage
ment of the Fruchtman Bros., will
open its doors to the public next Mon
day morning. The Fruchtman's are
busy today and will continue busy un
til the opening hour unpacking and
getting their stock ready for display,
but the opening will surely take place
on Monday morning, next, Oct. 9th.
The interior pf this beautiful store
is being fitted out in a modern way,
with fixtures at once ornamental and
artistic. There are special fitting
and dressing rooms and mirrors of
full length view to display the gar
ments' fit.
"The Fashion" is going to carry
by far the greatest line of ladies
ready-to-wear garments, including
coat suits, coats, skirts, waists, dress
es, etc., both for women and children
that has ever been shown in this city.
And it is no wonder the ladies of Pa
latka are waiting for the opening of
this modern store.
The Fruchtman's are experts in thi3
line. They have searched the markets
to secure goods that they feel will
please Palatka ladies. There will be
no further need of trips to Jackson
ville and Atlanta to get what you
want in the way of variety in ready-to-wear
goods.
Business men of this city, and in
fact' all Palatkans, are proud of this
new store and are predicting a bril
liant success for "The Fashion."
Major Glessner Still Active.
Most old residents will remember
Maj. W. L. Glessner, for a number
of years an active emigration agent
of the G. S. & F. R'y who some years
ago made frequent visits to this city,
and they will be pleased to learn that .
he is still an active force in the up-'
building of the South with special em
phasis on Georgia, his home State.
The following notice of him is clipped
from the Early County (Ga.) News of
last week:
"Major W. L. Glessner has accent
ed the position of special representa
tive of the Southern Ruralist, of At
lanta, the leading agricultural -journal
of the South. He will attend and
write up the agricultural fairs and
other important agricultural gather
ings in the bouth, investigate and re
port on special agricultural conditions
and enterprises. Major Glessner is
thoroughly familiar with the work he
has undertaken, by past experience.
having been trained in the newspaper
work and later in industrial promo
tion. The News congratultes the
Ruralist upon obtaining his services.
and is glad to know that the Early
County b air will be among those han
dled by him."

President Barrett Speaks.
President Barrett of the National
Farmers Educational and Co-operative
Union addressed a small assem
bly of Palatka business men and
farmers of the county at the court
house last Saturday afternoon.
His address was principally to
farmers, in which he poked them in
the ribs for not arousing themselves
and demanding their rights as citi
zens. What the farmer needed was
co-operative effort; with this they
could get aything they demanded in
the way of rights. He didn't say it
in so many words, but he implied
that.
The farmer is a doughhead
Who never will advance;
He licks the boots of freedom
And of wealth at every chance;
He votes the party ticket
And is wearing shoddy pants,
As he goes marching on.
'What Mr. Barrett wants is for the
farmer to organize and assert him
self. The Union which he represents
was organized for just such concert
ed effort ir. behalf of the farmer.
Mr. Barrett is a forceful speaker
and held the close attention of his
audience throughout his address.
Episcopal Church Activities.
Rev. Dr. Crittenden, the new rector
of St. Marks church, is expected to
arrive in Palatka with his family
about the 15th inst. to take up his
work with the church. Those of the
congregation who have had the pleas
ure of meeting Dr. Crittenden are
sure that under his leadership the
church work will advance and that the
new rector will soon establish himself
in the hearts of all the people of the
city.
The vestry is preparing the rectory
for the coming of Dr. Crittenden and
many repairs are being made looking
to the comfort of the rector's home.
At an oyster supper given in the
Arcade on Wednesday night by the la
dies of the church more than $40 was
made for church work.
Tampa to Entertain Veterans.
Tampa, Oct. 5th Tampans are
making elaborate preparations for the
entertainment of Confederate veter
ans of Florida, who will hold their
annual reunion in the city October
17 to 19, inclusive, and a large at
tendance of veterans, sons and daugh
ters of veterans and visitors general
ly is expected. Xhe railroad rate
offered for the round trip from all
sections of the state is one fare plus
25 cents, with a liberal time limit.
This will be one of the last reu
nions held by the veterans, many of
whom have grown too old to attend,
by reason of which Tampa invites all
lovers of the "lost cause" to join in
paying them tribute. Union veter
ans also will participate in the reu
nion, a feature of whom will be a
"Blue and Grey" barbecue.
Brakman Breaks Forth.
Editor Palatka News:
I s.;r spending a few days in r-.y
lit "c shack in the Florahome ham
iivj.k. Like Adam started, 1 -Kirn
nlone not necessarily lonesome -a.s
there is plenty of cattle, razorbacks
and at least one wild cat. I had jiot
been, here in so long that folks ad
dressed me as a stranger, even the
big owl was not just certain as to
my identity, for from the top of the
big magnolia tree he frequently
shouts "Who-who-oo." I see no signs
of people getting a living here with
out working for it, yet I never come
out here without seeing something
good. Possibly I see things differ
ent from others.
Our enthusiasm has taken a fresh
impetus, for I found the dredge pass
ing through our own little posses
sions. When we purchased this land
three years ago we were advised to
let it alone as it was worthless and
would never be drained. Today corn
is growing right in sight of it so
tall that I cannot reach the ears. If
all is well it will not be many weeks
before Orange Grove Lake will be
reached, and I predict that it will be
lowered at least one-half that is ap
proximately six miles from the mouth
of the canal.
The south prairie is ready for those
who care to jerk off their coats and
proceed. It requires but little effort
to say "GoBoys," but there are places
where it requires a man to say "Come,
Boys."
With one great want already real
ized another will be created, grow
ers will want silos in which to store
their corn crops, and which it is cal
culated adds one-third to its value,
(a profit within itself.) With the cat
tle tick swept away, hog cholera un
der control and a waiting market at
all times for any .quantity, I have
every reason to believe that prosperi
ty is in store for all who care to en
gage in stock raising in any locality
that gives like promise of remunera
tive returns for honest endeavor.
In my native home (Ashtabula
County, Ohio), the most prosperous
and well-to-do farmers are those who
keep stock. When the tick is gone
(and it is gSnig) I hope to be able to
say the same of the farmers of Put
nam county, Florida, the land of our
adoption.
