NEW YORK, Oct. 6. Ambassador
Gerard, according to the Evening Post
this afternoon. Is bringing to Presi
dent Wilson an application from Ger
many for the President to aid In suing
for peace. The Post article says in
part:
. "Germany has definitely decided to
apply to President Wilson to aid In
suing for peace with the Allies.
"Important banking interests in
close touch with Gerard's plans, say
that the number of nations involved
would make it impossible to secure
peace for months even though Wilson
acted as a mediator.
"Ambassador Gerard Is on board the
steamer Frederick VIII which left
from the other side last Saturday and
due here probably on Tuesday next.
Corroboration from this side has sub
stantiated the belief in financial cir
cles. The main statement made with
great positheness tends to confirm
the government rumors afloat."

SERIES

One Hundred Men on Boston
Streets Offer to Buy or
Sell Tickets.
SHELTERED SEATS $5
Even National Commission
Headquarters Is Placarded -
With Big Signs.
(United Tress Staff Correspondent)
BOSTON, Oct. 6. World series
ticket scalpers today grabbed Boston,
bag and baggage.
Favored by tho best weather the
weather man could present, the op
ening of the battle between the Bos
ton Red Sox and the Brooklyn
Dodgers found 100 nattily attired
young men on the down town streets,
ready either to buy or sell tickets
for the 1916 clashes.
Never before in the history of the
world's series has ticket scalping been
so brazen. In the Copley Hotel,
where the national commission has
rented almost an entire floor to carry
on its operations, red type signs-told
where the world's series tickets
could be obtained. These signs are
the most prominent things in the lob
by. Ticket speculation is going on
under the very noses of Ban John
son and Garry Hermann.
The out-of-town patrons, who are
filling every available hotel in Boston,
are given the alternative of buying
grandstand tickets at $25 or $30 a
pair for three games or doing without
them. At the ball park the word was
passed out long ago that he who
should get tickets today would be
lucky.

C.L
W ER PRAISES
COUNTRY CLUB PLAN
Says Organization Would
Help Develop Columbia
Residence Districts.
CITES OTHER TOWNS
Social and Athletic Advan
tages Commended by M.U.
Athletic Director.
A country club is a good financial
investment both to the persons en
rolled in it and to the city In which
it is located, C. L. Brewer, director
of athletics In the University, de-j
clared yesterday. , It will improve
town properties located near the
club grounds and raise the price of
land because of the improvements
which are placed upon the grounds,
he says .
"I have in mind an Illustration of
this fact," Mr. Brewer said. "I know
of a country club which was started
with a capital of $2,000 and a mem
bership fee of $50. It was in a town
smaller than Columbia. Today the
stock In the club is worth from $250
to $300 a share and the mose desirable
residence district of the town Is locat
ed near tho country club. The club
grounds have trebled In value and the
town itself has become more prosper
ous and progressive because of the
country club spirit."
"Helps Hesidenco District"
That the best residence districts of
any cities are to be found around their
country clubs was Mr. Brewer's as
sertion. The fact Is almost unvary
ing, he says.
"In addition to the investment fea
tures of a country club, there are its
social features'' Mr. Brewer said. "It
is a 'get-together' place for all of its
members and a place to renew old
and make new; acquaintances. It is
a place for the business man to take
his family for an outing after busi
ness hours . The clubhouse should be
built so that the women of the club
could gle their receptions there, the
club couM hold dances and if feasible
there should be a grill where ban
quets and lunches could be served.
"The most desirable athletic feature
of a country club, of course, is a golf
links. Golf is a beneficial game for
the business man. There could also
be tennis courts and other athletic
fields on the club grounds.
"Columbia Ideal Sjwt for Club."
"The topography of the country sur
rounding . Columbia is such that a
natural site for the location of the
club could 'be easily selected. There
are many places near the city which
have the natural facilities necessary
to the building of a golf course.
"I believe that Columbia is reatiy
for the country club. I also believe
that one could be formed If the move
ment was once started. It Is a thing
for which there is a large field open
in the social life of the community."
Mr. Brewer also gave Instances of
country clubs which are being op
erated In towns smaller than Colum
bia with success.
TELLS OF FULTON COUNTRY CLUB
Howard B. Lang Believes Columbia
Should Have Similar Organization.
"Columbia is a promising field for
a country club, and (I see no reason
why one should not be organized suc
cessfully," said Howard B. Lang,
stenographer of the , 'Boone County
Circuit Court and a member of the
Fulton Country Club, this morning.

sent out yesterday and today to 6,500
families living in Columbia's trade
territory. It was by far the most

sons to visit Columbia next week.
The announcement went to thousands
of persons who have never been to
Columbia to trade, or who have never
received the announcement of the Co
lumbia stores.
Several merchants who are co-op
erating in the trade extension plans
inspected the mailing lists used in
sending out the special announce
ments and were greatly impressed
with the tremendous trade possibil
ities of the territory surrounding Co
lumbia. Several firms have suggest
ed that the Trade Week plans be made
an annual event for the people in the
Columbia trade territory and that Co
lumbia should plan some kind of a
fall celebration in connection with the
fare-refund trade carnival.

of the Trade Week fare-refund as
sociation are:
