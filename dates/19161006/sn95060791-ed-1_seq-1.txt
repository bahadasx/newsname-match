POLITICAL CAMPAIGN OPEN
Democrats Started Campaign by
a Big Rally Tuesday Night,
and Republicans Followed Suit
Wednesday Night.
Last Tuesday was a big day
for the democrats in Navajo
county. The occasion was the
visit to the county by most of
the prominent leaders of the
party in the state.
Senator Henry F. Ashurst and
Congressman Carl Hayden were
here. Of the state officials
also here were Governor G. W.
P. Hunt, Attorney General Wiley
B. Jones. Chas. K. Howe, tax
commissioner, Jesse L. Boyce,
candidate for auditor of state,
and G. H. Bolin, mine inspector.
Arrangements had been pre
viously made for holding rallies
in Holbrook and in Snowflake.
Senator Ashurst and Attorney
General Jones went to Snowflake
in the afternoon and that night
addressed a large crowd of peo
ple upon the main issues in the
national and state campaigns.
In Holbrook the Pastime the
ater had been secured for the
evening and at that place there
assembled a large number of peo
ple of all political faiths to listen
to the men advertised to speak.
At this meeting Judge D. J.
Thomas acted as chairman and
the felicitous manner in which
he performed the duties of that
position was the occasion for
much favorable comment.
Governor Hunt was the first
speaker introduced, and for near
ly an hour held the close atten
tion of his listeners. He gave a
resume of state business and a
history of the state institutions
during the years he has held the
office of chief executiye.
Chas. R. Howe, candidate for
reelection to .the office, of tax
commissioner, was the second
man called upon for a speech.
His talk was filled with statistics,
and proved that the office of tax
commissioner is an important
one.
Congressman Carl Hayden
was the third speaker of the
enening and his speech was an
excellent one. He discussed
national issues only and his re
marks were brief and to the
point. Congressman Hayden
possesses many of the elements
of eloquence; he knows what he
wishes to say and how to say it;
and he knows when to quit. The
congressman is yery popular in
this county and will receive a
big majority at the November
election.
After Congressman Hayden's
speech, Mr. Bolin and Mr. Boyce
each made short talks, that of
the latter being in a humorous
yien, and it was well received by
the audience.
The evening closed with a
dance in which Judge Thomas,
chairman of the political meet
ing, covered himself with as
much glory as he had during the
earlier part of the evening.
Republican Meeting Well Attended
The republicans opened their
campaign Wednesday night at
the Pastime theater with some
of their biggest guns. Ex-Governor
Joseph H. Kibbey, candi
date for U. S. senate; Judge 0.
J, Baughn, candidate for the
state supreme bench, and J. V.
Prochaska, candidate for secre
tary of state, all made speeches.
Notwithstanding the fact that
the meeting had been arranged
for a late hour after the mov
ing picture show a large crowd
of people attended. W. H.
Clark, secretary of the county
central committee, presided at
the meeting, and introduced each
speaker in a few well chosen
words.
Mr. Prochaska was the first
speaker, and he, as did Judge
Baughn who followed, devoted
his talk principally to state is
sues. Each of these gentlemen
set forth their claims to election,
and each confessed that in order
to accomplish that result he
hoped to receive the votes of
some democrats.
Ex-Governor Kibbey closed
the speechmaking and confined
himself almost exclusively to
national issues. The Washing
ton administration was handled
without gloves, both as regards
it foreign policy and the ad
ministration of home affairs.
The campaign for votes is now
on. Both of the big political
partios have opened it with
! lisonir ovti llc-ir (i ra Thf lpnflprS
of both seem to be confident of
victory, and the fate of each will
be decided by the voters on the
7th of November next.
Republican Candidate for
Jvstice of the Peace
In another column there ap
pears for the first time the an
nouncement of W. B. Woods as
a candidate for justice of the
peace in Holbrook precinct. Mr.
Woods is eminently qualified for
the office he seeks. He is a man
of fair and open mind; he has
the judicial temperament and is
impartial and unprejudiced in
his conclusions.
Bv experience Mr. Woods is
well fitted for the office of justice
of the peace. For sixteen years
he served as clerk of the court
in Navajo county, part of this
time as clerk of the district court
under territorial form of govern
ment! and for one term as clerk
of the superior court, to which
office he was elected.
Mr. Woods did not seek the
office of justice of the peace in
the primaries, but he was never
theless nominated by republican
friends and he now feels that it
is incumbent upon him to make
the race. If elected he promises
to conduct the office in a fair and
impartial manner, deciding every
case that may come before him
according to the law and the
evidence.

' New Potato Propagated
bu Mr. P. P. Rencher
,
j An Apache county farmer has
successfully originated a very ex-
cellent potato. It is becoming
the principal potato of Apache
county and is so successful here
that it bids fair to become one
of the leading potatoes of Ameri
ca. It is locally known as the
Kencher Surprise. It was
named for Peter P. Rencher of
Eagar. The potato is the largest
we have in our local market and
is entirely white. While not
overly mealy, it is reasonably so,
and has an excellent flavor.
It is interesting to know the
method by which Mr. Rencher
worked. He imported some
quite large potatoes that grew
nicely on his farm at Eagar but
they were dark colored and con
sequently did not look so nice
upon the table when they were
cooked. One day Mr. Rencher
noticed that some of the potatoes
had white eves At the time for
spring planting he cut out all of
the white eyes and planted them
by themselves. Next season
most of the potatoes had more
white eyes. He again selected
and planted white eyes and kept
repeating this until no blue eyes
nor blue meat ever appeared in
the potatoes any more. He also
selected the larger and better
potatoes for seed, and by arti
ficial selection has got the other
good qualities, until the "Rencher
Surprise" potato is a great favo
rite in Apache county and is be
ing introduced into other counties
of northern Arizona. St. Johns

Puts Up Big Cash Bond
Fay Sheek who has been an
inmate of the county bastile for
the past few weeks, was released
on a bail of $10,000.00. Mr.
Sheek killed Leonard Olson at
Houck some few months' ago and
was placed under a bond of $10,
000.00 and some few weeks ago
one of his bondsmen sold out his
holdings in Apache county and
thus was disqualified to serve
longer as a bondsman. ' Mr.
Sheek came into the county seat
and gave himself up to the peace
officers until he could obtain
another bondsman.
Monday Mr. R. Small of Re
dondo Beach, Calif., arrived in
the city and put up a cash bond
of $10,000.00 for Mr. Sheek.

False Report Circulated
Certain persons have been cir
culating the report that if elects
ed sheriff of Nayajo County in
the coming election, I shall ap
point certain persons as deputy
sheriffs.

not make any promises or agree
ments regarding my deputy
sheriffs, and any reports con
cerning this matter are absolute
ly untrue and false.
Should the yoters of Navajo
County elect me as sheriff, I
shall select and appoint as my
deputies the best men available.
Respectfully submitted,
Jos. F. Woods.

Cow Thief Arrested
Yesterday Harry John, a Nava
jo Indian about 30 years old, was
arrested by L. H. Mickey, live
stock inspector in this county,
upon the charge of stealing a
cow belonging to Geo. W. Hen
nessey. The arrest was made
by Mr. Mickey, accompanied by
Mr. Hennessey, near Maddox.
The cow had been sold by the
Indian to G. V. Robinson, who
operates a tradinptore at Mad
dox, after the brand on the ani
mal had been changed.
John was brought to town by
Mr. Mickey and Mr. Hennessey
and was placed in jail. He was
charged with a similar crime
about two years ago but escaped
conviction. This time the evi
dence against him seems to be
conclusive.
Discovery of Grand Canyon
The first white men to see the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado
were Cardenas and his 12 com
panions, who were guided there
by the Hopi Indians from Tu-
sayan. Cardenas was sent by
Coronado to find the wonderful
river of which De Tovar had
heard from the Indians. He re
mained four days on the rim at
some point now unknown, look
ing in vain for a way to decend.
It is always interesting to recall
the heroic trip madebyMaj. J.
W. Powell down the Grand Can
yon in small boats when prac
tically nothing was known of its
course or character. His journey
began at Green River, Wyo.,
May 24, 1869, and was notably
successful. (U. S. Geological Sur

stimulated shipments from the
ranges, according to livestock
dealers. Despite the heavy re
ceipts, the market was strong.
