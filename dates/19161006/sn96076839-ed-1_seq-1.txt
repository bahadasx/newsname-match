Fire Pre-
ventionDay
A Proclamation by the Governor
In order to arouse the citizens and
v property owners of Michigan to a vivid
JAise of our great fire dangers, and to
induce them to co-operate with the
Fire Marshal that we may secure a re
duction of our enormous fire losses and
reduce our excessive fire insurance
rates, ITTereby proclaim that
Monday, The Ninth Day of Oct. 191G,
the anniversary of the great Chi
cago fire, be known as
STATK FIRE PREVENTION DAV,
and I most urgently recommend that
our people observe it by a general
cleaning up and removal of rubbish,
trash, inflammable material and waste
from their premises.
Concurrent action upon the part of
newspapers, public officials, school
teachers, fire departments, and all
civic societies and property owners will
surely result in such a general clean
up of all dirt and refuse, and the re
moval of fire hazards as not only to
promote beauty and sanitation through
out the state, but to have a pronounced
influence in lowering the fire loss.
- The fire losses in Michigan each year
lan into millions of dollars. The fire
sses in the United States and Canada
in 1915 were $184,980,100. The fire
losses for the first eight months of 191G
were $159,535,220, which is nearly $T0,
000,000 larger than for the same period
of the previous year.
Over 5,000 persons are killed and 50,
000 injured annually as a result of fire.
In MICHIGAN during 1915, 141 persons
lost their lives and 183 were seriously
burned or injured from this cause. AN
OUNCE OF PREVENTION IS WORTH
A TON OF FIRE FIGHTING APPARA
TUS. Seventy-five per cent of the
fires and accidents are due to prevent
able causes, and could easily be avoid
ed by the exercise of reasonable care
and precaution.
I sincerely trust the people of MICHI
GAN will see to it that FIRE PREVEN
TION DAY means something this year.
Given under my hand and the Great
Seal of the State, this twenty-sixth day
of September, in the year of our Lord

FORBIDDEN FRUIT
Motion Picture Attraction At
Temple Theatre, Wednesday
The photo-drama entitled "Forbid
den Fruit," a Standard Preferred Pro
duction, in five acts, which will be pre
sented at the Temple Theatre, Wednes
day, Oct. 11th. According to several
New York newspapers, is a photo
drama which really lessens the gap ex
isting between the legitimate spoken
drama and the screen play.
In reviewing one of the big scenes
of the photo-play a prominent New
York Critic states the following:
"In order to save her husband from
goin to prison on a charge of forgery,
she sacrificed herself, this woman.

She gave up all! Made of herself a
martyr for the love of a man. And
then he, too, spurned her. But far
sharper than a serpent's sting is the
ingratitude of man, the failure to look
behind the material things and see
dazzling white the glorious purity of a
saintly wife and mother.
Never has Ivan Abramson so clearly
portrayed human emo ions. Never
has this Balzac of motion picturedom
so mercilessly bared the soul of man
and woman. Everett Butterfield as
the husband, and Paula Shay as the
wife, and Ivan Abramson, the author
and director, have each established an
"overnight" hit in their respective
capacities.
Unheraluf J and unadvertised "For
bidden Fruit" struck New York like a
thunderbolt and immediately registered
a doubie barrelled bull's eye. It is
without doubt the foremost picture
production of the year."-
Two feature comedies will be pre
sented in support of the big film play:
Bud Fisher's Animated Cartoon Come
dy, "Jeff's Toothache," featuring those
two popular cartoon characters, "Mutt
and Jeff." The second comedy on the
bill will be, "Napoleon and Sally," the
Monkey Movie Stars in a standard
Jungle Comedy entitled, "From Jungle
to Trouble."
Two evening performances will be
given commencing at 7:15 and 9:00 p.m.
Admission 25 cents.

TRIP NO. 1.
(Fourth Day Out)
Sunday, Sept. 17, 191G, was spent in a
concrete city Detroit, in a concrete
fashion. A ride on a concrete street
or road is concretely concrete in its
adaptability to insure freedom from
bumps and slumps. A concrete road
around Pine Lake will insure hundreds
of cars and thousands of visitors for
Charlevoix County, only we do not
want to make the same mistake they
made by placing the expansion joints
straight across the road. Remember
thi, Hammond, Hipp and House (three
IPs, by Jiminey, and they are all good,
too.) Make us a sixteen foot concrete
road with expansion joints the entire
length of the road in the middle and
then on either side, about every forty
feet, plf.ee the joints on an angle of
about five degrees. This will cause
any spreading to go to the outside and
do away with any ridges in the road.
Monday night, we put the steamship,
"City of Cleveland" (a most magnifi
cent boat) in our old dump of a car and
drew it across Lake Erie to Buffalo.
Then they took the boat off and we
motored around tnere and brougnt up
at Hamburg, the home of one of my
nephews and spent Tuesday. Wednes
day, we were on our way to Rochester,
the most beautiful city in the United
States, were flour, kodaks, shoes, etc.i
are made in abundance. We made this
trip, 78 miles, in two and a fifth hours,
on. good roads, brick, concrete and oil
ed macadam. Here we are, waiting to
get our car repaired, having used ten
gallons of oil in 450 miles to Detroit.
The ship furnished the oil from Detroit
to Buffalo.
Thursday, Sept. 2C, 1916, off for
Syracuse. Arrived at 4:00 p. m., 90
miles. Good roads. Met about 350
cars, mostly $1,000 to $5,000 cars. Few
Fords. Fol lowed a race between a
skinny Ford and a big car for a couple
of miles, and the Ford kept ahead. The
most cars we meet are the big farm
trucks, carrying 100 to 120 boxes of
apples to a load. Roads smooth and
fruit comes in good condition quick
delivery every day in the year. Many
farms have a row of big apple trees on
the sides of the road. Land $200 to
$350 per acre. Fine big homes and im
mense barns and three or four silos.
Some pieces of there road are brought
up to a crown in the center like the
stretch to Petoskey. Where there are
no apple or fruit trees, there are big
old elms. The country is very beauti
ful and rolling. It is a question which ;

WMF The Strange ase
. VVT A v-
June Travis had, from her infancy, received all the
care and attention that inherited wealth and a boundless love could
furnish. Her naturally able mind and decisive personality were nourished and
trained to better develop in her the social instinct And indeed the happiness of
her lot made of her a bubbling well-spring of good will that inundated all with
whom she came in contact.
No one, not even the incessantly watchful Mary, knew of the un
controllable urge that sometimes dominated her and brought with it that hideous,
irregular band on the back of her right hand. It was an urge that had come down to her
through many generations and it meant no good, neither it nor the blotchy Red Circle that
told of its presence.
The Red Circle was the mark of the notorious Bordens a family so separated
from the Travises that they knew not of each other even by reputation.
Still there it was and it was the outward manifestation of an inward blight that
made the girl a menace to society.
It affected her life strangely; how strangely you may know by reading

School Commissioner's
Notes
May L. Stewart, Commissioner
Eveline, South Arm and Evangeline
schools visited last yeek.
The teachers of Evangeline township
met the afternoon of Friday the 29th,
at the Tainter school house.
The South Arm and Eveline teachers
met at the office of the commissioner
on Saturday, Sept. ?0th.
Evangeline township can boast one
school almost ready for state approval.
One year ago the Wildwood school was
without a woodshed or water supply,
had no warm cloakrooms for the boys
and girls, no globe, maps or available
blackboards. The visit to the school on
Friday last found these things not only
provided but so well planned and so
well arranged that the looks and ser
viceability of the building are increas
ed 100 fold. Do you wonder what
plans they adopted? Then visit this
little school in the forest and have the
pleasure of discovery.
The Tainter school has started the
solution of the water' supply problem
which has been troubling them for
some time.
Of the Eveline and South Arm schools
all but four have the approved registers
and about half of the books are from
the recommended list. .
There are six schools in Eveline twp.
Of these there are three Standard
Schools, there are four that have in
stalled ventilating systems, four have
indoor chemical toilets, five have the
walls tinted in approved colors, and
five have drinking fountains. Five of
the six schools are at least partly sup
plied with single adjustable seats plac
ed so that the teacher may secure the
best possible discipline with the least
possible effort.
There are four rural schools in South
Arm township. There is as yet no
Standard School among them, one has
the window and lighting arrangement
and amount approved by the state
superintendent, there are two ventilat
ing systems, no indoor closets, none
with the walls tinted, and no adjust
able seats. One has the seats correctly
placed for discipline and comfort.
Most of the schools were supplied
with all appendages legally necessary,
but in all cases a written report in de
tail was made to the director of the dis
trict.
The Ranney school has a splendid
new cement approach.
The Rock Elm school looks fine from
an outside view but you can not appre
ciate what they have done from the
roadside. Walk in!
Sewing classes for the girls have
been reported at Springvale, the Ger
man school and at Three Bells. What
for the boys, we ask?
Junior Farmer's League organized at
North Wilson.
The Advance school received its
Standard Plate in June 1915. At the
annual meeting in July 191G they voted
to build a new woodshed attached to .
the building at the rear and that it
should be one of which they should not
be ashamed. They have scored a vic
tory in plan and in construction and
they surely deserve the Honor Plate
about which they inquire.
Eveline No. 3, installed Wolverine
systems adjoining the cloakrooms
which are opposite and facing the
teacher's desk for direct supervision
from the teacher. This district has not
declared itself in line for any plate of
any kind but they have seen the rea
son underlying state construction plans
and have obtained a maximum of ser
vice from a minimum cost. The direc
tor ha-, shown care and foresight in the
selection of all school room supplies
during his term of office.
Eveline No. 6, has been rather busy
of late but the final outcome of their
plans has not yet been decided.
Home Credit Work fairly booming
everywhere! It's the one big thing for
forming habits of thrift, of industry,
and of joy in labor.
Columbus Day soon. Look up the
law on patriotism.
First Standard School in Michigan
was the Old Mission School in Grand
Traverse County, which received its
plate March 11, 1914. There were one
year irom mat date itb btanaara
Schools in Michigan. There are now
236 Stanford Schools, 195 of which are
in 15 counties. There are 5 Standard
Schools in Charlevoix County.

wedding gown the average bride begins
