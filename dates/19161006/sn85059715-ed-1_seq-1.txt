THOUSANDS COMING

4
Club Meets Tonight to Arrange
for Nominee's 'Reception
Here Wednesday.
| Arrangements for tho reception of
CharlCB K. Hughes, Republican presi
dential nominee, when he visits tliis
city Wednesday morning, will he made
at a meeting of a committee appointed
by Harr.v c. Hoffman, president of tho
Hughes club, to be held at 8 o'clock
this evening in the Hughes club head
quarters in the Gore building on Sec
ond street. All members of the club,
whether members of the committee or
not,, and all other persons interested
in the Buccess of the Republican ticket,
are asked to attend the meeting.
Although no arrangements have yet
been made, pending tonight's meeting,
it is very probable that a platform will
be erected at the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad station. Mr. Hughes's stay
in the city Is limited to one hour and
local Republican leaders wish to havo
him devote all of that time to his
speech, and they are of the opinion
that it would be a waste of valuable
time to have the nominee go to some
place far removed from the depot, and
then havo to return there in time to
leave for Parkersburg. It was also
Mid today that it was probable some
f
arrangements would be made at to
night's meeting to secure some audi,
torium In the city to be used for the
meeting In case of lnclcment weather.
Reports to Roy E. Parrish, chairman
of the Republican county executive
committee, today were to the effect that
every district In the county would bo
well represented at the meeting. Other
counties will also send large delega
tions to hear the Republican presiden
tial nominee, according to information
received at state headquarters. Mar-1
[ ion, Taylor, Lewis, Doddridge, Monon
galia. Barbour and other nearby coun
ties arc going to send hundreds here
to hear Mr. Hughes, according to re
ports from the county chairmen to
Secretary CofTman of the state execu
tive committee.
Mr. Hughes, as announced In Thurs
day's Telegram, will arrive In the city
at 9 a. m? Instead of at 10 a. m? as
announced several days ago. He will
leave at 10 o'clock for Parkertburg,
where he speaks about noon. The
change in schedule was made by the
Republican national headquarters.
Announcement was mado at Repub
lican state headquarters this morning
that Judge Ira E. Robinson, Republi
can nominee for governor, will accom
pany Mr. Hughes on his trip through
the state. Judge Robinson will join
the Hughes party here. J
