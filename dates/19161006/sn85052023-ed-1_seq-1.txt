SALARY IS RAISED
T
HELD OVER ON ASSAULT AND
. BATTERY CHARGE.
Adair Boys Claim They Were At
tacked and Cursed Officers Say
Youths Started the Trouble
Deputy Sheriff Roscoe Brice,
Jailer Tom Brown, of Casey county
and Town Marshal Sam Raines, of
Liberty, were held to the Lincoln
county grand jury by County Judge
James P. Bailey, on assault and bat
tery charges preferred by Grover
Caldwell, an Adair county youth.
The bonds of Brice and Raines were
fixed at $300 and that of Brown at
$150, all of which were given by
Sheric J. D. Taylor, of Casey, who
came down here with the men for
the trial Thursday.
The trials were the outcome of
some trouble which occurred at
Moreland last Saturday night, when
Caldwell, his two brothers and sev"
eral other Adair county young men
came there to take a train for Cin
cinnati where they expected to find
work. They were stretched about on
the floor of the depot, waiting for the
early morning Sunday excursion.
About 10 o'clock, according to Gro
ver Caldwell's testimony, Brice and
Raines entered, and began going over
the crowd with a searchlight, as if
looking for some one. When they
came to him, he endeavored to push
the light out of his eyes, when, he
said, the two men grabbed him,
shook him, and bumped him up and
down on the floor. He said that he
-Avas 'frightened and endeavored to
get up and away from them, and
when he got up Raines struck him
over the head with his pistol butt,
and as he ran out of the door shot
at him twice. As he ran across the
railroad tracks, he said, that Brown
met him and grabbed him, and held
him while Raines turned a search
light on him; and after discovering
that he was not the man they were
evidently after, cursed him repeated"
ly, calling him all sorts of vile names.
He said Brown offered to go with him
to wash the blood off his head, but he
was too frightened to go with him.
The youth's testimony was corrob
orated by his brother, Robert Cald
well, who said that when he endeav
ored to stop his brother and Raines
while they were scuffling, Brice
struck him with his fist "like the kick
of a mule" as he called it, and
knocked him away. He said that as
his brother ran out, with Raines af
ter him, Brice called to Raines to
"kill him, Sam, I am with you." He
said that when Raines fired at his
brother, Raines had the pistol point
ed right at the middle of his bro
ther's back and that he knocked his
arm up as Raines fired, but that
Raines shot the second time, as his
brother ran, without interference.
Neither of the shots struck Caldwell.
Ed Sexton, another of the Adair
county boys, testified to the same ef
fect. All were evidently scared
greatly by the treatment they had re
ceived, and Grover Caldwell appear"
ed in court with his head bandaged
up from the injury he had received.
All three men said that the Casey
county officers seemed to them to
have been drunk.
The three officers, when placed on
the stand, said that they had gone
to Moreland to catch a man named
West, who was wanted for malicious
shooting, and that Mr. Brown .went
to look through the hotels at More
- land, while the other two officers
looked over the crowd in the wait
ing room. All vigorously denied
that they were drunk, but each ad
mitted to have taken a drink at Hus
tonville. Brice and Raines said that they
had passed over many of the men
with their flashlight, as they lay on
the floor of the depot, but when they
came to Caldwell, he pushed the
light away and came up fighting.
Raines and Brice both said that he
struck Raines a blow on the jaw and
grabbed him by the hair, and Raines
said that as he did this, he pulled
his pistol and hit Caldwell over the
head. He and Brice both denied that
Brice had told him to kill Caldwell
as he ran but said that Brice told
him to catch him. He said he did
not know West, the man they were
looking for, but thought Caldwell
was West when he began to run, and
fired in the air thinking it would
stop him. All of the men denied
cursing the youths. They waited at
Moreland while the Adair county
boys came to Stanford after war
rants for them. Deputy Sheriff
John Moser, of this county, testified
that Brown was cursing when they
came back with the warrants, and
that he made him stop.
The Casey county officers were de
fended by Attorney George D. Flor
ence, while T. J. Hill, Jr., acted as
County Attorney in the absence of
County Attorney W. S. Burch, and
was assisted by Attorneys P. M. Mc
Roberts and J. N. Menefee, Jr., act
ing for the Moreland Law and Order
League.
Judge Bailey said he thought that
the case needed further investiga
tion by the grand jury and held the
defendants over. Several of the
Adair county youths who were with
them, said that it is probable that
actions for civil damages will be
filed against the Casey officers as a
result of the affair.

Col. Dunn Says Prices Should Be Up
This Winter
Tobacco will be way up this win
ter according to Col. I. M. Dunn,
head of the People's house of Dan
ville, who was here a short while
Wednesday en route to the Paul
Finch sale at Crab Orchard. Col
Dunn is very optimistic in reeard to
the outlook, and is urging all who
have a good crop of the weed to hold
it, for he says, indications are that
prices will be the highest in some
time.
"The North Carolina market is op
ening splendidly," said Col. Dunn.
"Prices there are just double what
they were last year. The South Caro
lina crop is way short, and every
thing points to phenomenal figures
on the Kentucky breaks when theV
open. Our market at Danville will
open on December 1st. and every to
bacco grower who sells his weed at
the barn is taking an awful chance
on losing a big bunch of money. Ev
ery indication is that we are going
to have the best market and the best
prices in years. Wo rill have buyers
on hand from all of the leading com
panies. The demand for tobacco is
growing all the time, and things cer
tainly do look good for the Kentucky
grower this fall and winter."
ENGLEMAN HORSE SECOND
A number of his -friends at his old
home here went to the trots at Lex
ington Tuesday to see John Engle
man's great three-year-old trotter
Harrod's Creek start in the $14,000
Kentucky Futurity. While it was not
expected that this horsee could win,
as the greatest three-year-old of this
and many other years was entered
against him in the speedy mare Vol
ga, Lngleman s horse easily took
second money which amounted to
$3,100. The Lexington Herald said
this of Harrod's Creek's performance
however: But all of the credit of the
race does not belong to Volga, as
great as her performance was. Sec
ond, the first two heats and making
the principal fight in all three of
them was Harrod's Creek. Nothing
but praise could be heard for the
sturdy chestnut that has made such a
high class campaign this season. He
trotted this race as he has trotted
all the season without making mis
take or break and reflected great
credit on his trainer. He looks like
one of the very best stake trotters
insight for next year.

A NOVEL APPLE BRANDY CASE
A novel question will come before
the Court of Appeals for decision
when the case of H. L. Boggs, of
Johnson county, indicted for selling
liquor without a license and fined
$60, reaches the Court. Irvine Jayne,
a farmer of Johnson county, took
his apples to Bogg's distillery and
had them made into brandy, the men

question for the Court to decide is
whether Boggs is guilty of selling
liquor without a license by reason of
making brandy out of Jayne's apples
and giving him half of the liquor.

East End early in the week inspect
r.g the work of tiling 150 acres of
he R. H Bronaugh farm which he

about a year ago. They are having a
Louisville firm which makes a speci
alty of this sort of work install til
ing which will give them cultivation
every year 150 acres of what they
expect to prove some of the very fin
est corn land around here. Putting in
tiling in this much ground is an ex
pensive proposition, and will cost
the gentlemen something like $3,000,
but they satisfied that the result
will be well worth it. They have in
about 120 acres of corn on this farm
this season, which is in fine shape.
James Messer is running the place

vote the democratic ticket this fall
for Woodrow Wilson, for the first
time in their history. They said that
they knew that Wilson had kept this
country out of the great war and
they felt it would be very unwiseto
take a dangerous chance by putting
some one else at the head of the
government. Mr. Hopper says that
he was greatly surprised to hear so
many old-time republicans say this.

dormant in a town, it is prima facie

of double condemnation, for it is
faithless not only to its own children

FISCAL COURT INCREASES PAY
OF COUNTY ROAD ENGINEER
Mr. Riffe Tells Court He Cannot Af
ford To Do Work For Less
Than $1,400 A Year
At the regular meeting of the Lin
coln county fiscal court here Tues
day County Road Engineer J. L. Mc
Kee Riffe was re-elected for a term
of two years, and his salary was in
creased from $1,200 to $1,400 a
year. This was done by the votes of
three members of the court, Squires
Helm, Petrey and Camden, Squire
Dudderar refusing to vote for it. Mr.
Riffe explained to the court that he
could not afford to work for the sal
ary he had been receiving, and in
formed the court that as far as he
was concerned, if they could get a
man to take the work at the former
salary, to do so, but that he could not
do so and if they desired him, they
would have to pay him a figure he
could live on. During the past year,
Mr. Riffe was allowed $600 extra
for assistance in conducting his de
partment, but none of this sum was
expended. The court, in increasing
his salary, reduced the sum available
for assistance, if such should be
needed, to $400, so that the appro
priation for the department should
not be increased. The magistrates
say they are satisfied with the work
Mr. Riffe has done.
Reports as to the work under the
state-aid pike reconstruction were
made. At a previous meeting, the
court voted to borrow $6,500 from
the Lincoln County National Bank,
until the funds available from the
state shall have been received, to
carry on the road work. The greater
part of the Boone Way from Crab
Orchard to Danville, has been finish
ed this year, and if good weather
continues, for a few weeks longer, it
may be possible to finish these two
roads this year. All who ride ovel
them concede that no better macad
amized roads are to be found any
where. TO DECIDE FINALLY ON FAIR
A meeting of the Stanford K. of
P.'s will be held on Thursday night,
Oct. 19th, at which final action will
be taken upon the question of having
a fair next year. The matter was
reopened at the regular lodge meet
ing Thursday night, and it was de
cided to canvass carefully the senti
ment of the lodge members and set
tle the question at the time stated.
It is understood that Ed Ballard has
agreed to lease the fair grounds to
the lodge for another fair if they
desire to hold it. Final reports from
this year's fair show that the lodge
cleared something like $700 from
the exhibition, a splendid showing,
all concede when it is considered
that the first day was rainy and the
crowd kept clown to the minimum.
