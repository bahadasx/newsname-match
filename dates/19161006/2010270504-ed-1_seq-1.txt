No Successor Elected.
Tho directors of tho Chamber of
Commorco hold a meeting last ovon
lng and with roluctnnco accoptbd tho
resignation of Secretary Fisher, who
goos to Boise, Idaho.. It was tho
sense of tho board that Mr. Fisher bo
prosen'ted with somo romombrnnco of
his good work, nnd it will bo solected
by a committee. A strong lottor of
commendation to be presented to the
Boise Commercial Club will bo pre
pared. Ono application as a successor to
Mr, Flshor was rocoivod, but not ac
cepted. I't is probable that tho selec
tion of a successor will not be made
until noxt spring, Miss Dorothy Hih
man, in tho meantime, to bo retained
to do tho clorical work, And mpmbors
of tho directory will bo detailed' to as
sist her. I't is believed that in this
way tho work can bo handled very
nicely during tho winter months.
