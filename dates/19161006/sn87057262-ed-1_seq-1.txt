BERLIN, Oct. 6. Submarine
blockade of certain English harbors
was suggested to the government by
several leaders of the Von Tirpitx

submarine warfare, it was learned to
day. The Von Tirpitx supporters
offered this suggestion as a compro

would be In accord with the 'chancel

prosecuting a vigorous war against
England and would cut off English
food and ammunition supplies without

NEW YORK, Oct. 6.—"New York's
too damned quiet. This traction
strike is too much like a picnic. I'm
going to stir 'em up and I'm going to
do it through the women."
Eighty-six year old "Mother" Jones,
angel of the mine camps, who stirred
women to the riot stage last night,
commented thus today, promising at_
the same time that the metropolis
would see some "fire, works" before
she was done. With every sentence,
she pounded ber fist on a table to
drive home her remarks.
"This labor trouble in New York
is just the start of a soical revolu

"I had hoped that it wasn't, but it
Is. And, it's really the women who
count in any nation. They start re

they made ^he men tear down the
bastile in the French revolution^-and
you know, there's never been a king
in France since then."
A twinkle came into her eyes, and
the set lines of her face relaxed.
"Yes, they stir things up a bit
last night," she said, reverting to the
riot incident, "You know womenf are
queering."
Just then the telephone rang. The
man at the ear end informed "Mother'
that two of rho women rioters had
