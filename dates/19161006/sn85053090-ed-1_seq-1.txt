Prays For Hughes
Chas. N. Pray, republican can
didate for IJ. S. Senator and
Frank J. Edwards, republican
candidate for governor opened
what was termed the republican
campaign in Fallon County last
Friday afternoon with a little
speaking at the Play House.
\\ ith a good crowd of local dem
ocratic believers and a body
guard of war horses from Baker,
the crowd finally assumed the
proportions of a meeting of the
clan and the speakers were ably
introduced by our fellow-towns
man W. W. Palmer. Mr. Pray
devoted the most of his time at
tempting to slur the Wilson ad
ministration and the rest of it to
boosting Mr. Pray. But not so
with Edwards. His entire time
was taken up with what "I have
done," no hints whatsoever hav
ing been given of what he had
not done. Mr. Edwards remarked
many times that his time was
very limited and that he would
nodi to have gone into details
concerning what he termed the
democratic failure of the state
administration. In all places
vhere Edwards has spoken so
far he has made practically the
aame excuse for not 'going into
total's, but to us it seems that if
a.dwards knows all these crooked
moves that he pretends to know,
1 would certainly bring him more
votes if he explained these de
tails during the time he wastes
tailing how he would like to do i
<). From here the party went!
o Maker where they held another]
similar meeting that evening j
"d:en Mr. Edwards still insisted]
that his time wr.s ve:j. valuable]
aid tiiat he could riot say any-\
liiag more than "I'm the guy j
for governor, even if I couldn't
handle that bunch of gamblers
when I was mayor of Helena." j
At the Woodrow Wilson Club
meeting Friday evening commit
tees were appointed to solicit
members and other campaign
matters taken up. O. A. Dahl
was selected as president of the :
club with Mrs. S. A. Holt as Sec-j
r tary. Within a very short time ]
-•peakers will be here under the
auspices of the club to speak on
the efficient administration of our
national affairs during the past
four years.
While out gathering his corn
crop last Sunday, DeLoss Hall, who
lias the smalt patch of corn north
jiu the jail, found the pocket book
j that was stolen from "Dummy"
11. 1 as tie berry during fair time.
| Tii ere was no money in it howev
! er, only a few papers. The wal
'et had been hid under a shock of
| corn. Up to the present time no
! arrests have been made but sev
! eral parties are under suspicion.

Romantic Wefdding
Two well known young people
of Miles City gave their friends
a sudden surprise last Saturday
by being very quietly married.
Miss Nellie Brayton and Mr.
Howard Yokley left in a car for
Forsyth Saturday morning, with
out a word to anyone, and were
married there, after which they
went on to Billings on a motor
honeymoon.
The bride is a charming mem
ber of the senior class of Custer
county high school, and except
during the school term, her home
is at Beebe, Montana. She is the
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Sam
Jarvis. Mr. Yokley is the eldest
son of Robert Yokley, of this
city, and is at present employed
in the Miles City National Bank.
—Miles City Journal.
A CANARD
It has been called to my notice
that certain persons have circu
lated the report that I have
promised, if elected to the office
of Sheriff, to select as my deputies
certain of my friends and rela
tives.
In this conncction I desire to
state that the Corrupt Practice
law makes it a crime to make
such promises before election,
and I certainly desire to be a law
abiding citizen whether elected
to the office or not.
As to the report circulated, I
have made no promises a n d
shall not, my position in the mat
ter of deputies is to appoint
men who are residents and rax
payers of Fallon County, who are
well qualified to do the work. I
shall use only the best men for
the positions, and as regards to
the names of any persons so far
mentioned tiiey will not be con
sidered by me.

A New Paper
This office is in receipt of Vol.
1 No. 1 of the Beaver Valley
Press, which is to be issued week
ly at Ekaihka by the Press Pub
lishing Co. The Press is repub
lican in politics and states that
the chief reason for its birth is
the hopes of its publishers that
they may be an aid to the repub
lican party in the county. The
Press is well edited and its make
up shows the work of a master
print, but by the ghost of the
old print, by which we all swear,
we see no reason for the estab
lishing of a second paper in a
town of Ekalaka's size, especial
ly when the field is so ably filled
as it is by Editor Dahl with his
"Eagle." —Boyes Blaze.
Mrs. Joe Hoffman left Thurs
day for a visit, at Omaha.
