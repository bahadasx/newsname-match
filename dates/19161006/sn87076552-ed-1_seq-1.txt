Bward of Health Visits Wauseon
and Calls on Council.
Long years ago when we were kids
we used to sing an alleged negro sone1
whkh ran '"Way down South on Ce-
dar Street, There's where .the darkies
rrow ten feet"; for the council a mo
atrn revision , would run, "Way up
North on Cedar Street, there's where
troubles grow ten feet", and even
twenty. The present mix-up had its
origin years ago when the makers
of the town were platting the lots
and street lines of our fair city;
either somebody blundered, bungled
or forgot, or else they never expect
ed Cedar Street to be anything more
than an alley or perhaps a cow path.
The lots on the west side of the street
at the South enil run intn tha of rim t
frum tan tn rurontu oftf M
ungraceful zig-zag or the West street
line while the lots on the East side of
the street come up to a fairly straight
street line.
In the process of time people
bought the lots on the East side of
the street and built their homes
thereon, while across the street the
property owners built woodsheds and
barns and in the fullness of time thai
old Tribune office a two - story dry
goods box structure was placed at
the Southern extremity on Oak street
neither a thing of .beauty nor yet a
joy forever but extremely useful to
the Rural Egg Company, a firm that
is doing business in the building at
present.
So dawns the Summer of the year
A. D. 1916 and with it the spirit of
civic improvement and beautification
inspired and abetted by the Civic
Improvement Committee of the
Civic Club; the "bug" "gets" the pro
perty owners on the West Side of
Cedar street and they begin to "beau
tify." Mr. M. J. Dangler puts out
a side walk all in good faith that said
side walk is on his lot line, other resi
dents of Cedar street squint their
eyes down along where they think
the street line ought to be and con
clude that Mr. Dangler's walk is
in the street and pretty near the
middle of the street. Just here we
reach the pianissims or the cressendo
or something' else equally interesting
and we come back to earth and the
council who are trying to straighten
out matters, also the street, at the
same time deal fairly with everyone
and fix things so that Cedar street
residents shall live happily ever af
terwards Some big Job!
The council decided to' give parties
who are interested opportunity to
procure funds to purchase land nec-
essary to widen the street at the i gelf an honorary member of Toledo

Qualify,
IN selecting a SUIT or COAT the greatest problem before a WOMAN is to achieve a KNOWN
QUALITY, and CORRECT STYLE without sacrificing her individuality-her personality. Not
only must she patronize a store with a reputation for QUALITY and FASHION ACCURACY, but
she must choose that store which offers styles in a range of details and colorings. In other words
you must select from fashion's allurements that SUIT or COAT which was associated with you in
its designer's imagination.

the designing combined with the most charming

The Teacher Knows
DUBLIC School Teachers by disposition and training are perhaps more discriminating than most
A other type of women. The observant eye that can analyze a pupil is quick to detect REFINE
MENT, BEAUTY and QUALITY or the lack of them in dress. In this store that critical eye will
discern nothing to clash with the highest ideals of MERCHANDISE OF QUALITY.

with the situation and report at the
next regular meeting.
A visitor at the Council last Mon
day evening was a Mr. Durrell, Sani-!
Health who had spent the day in
Wauseon looking over the sewer sit-
uation. Drobably preliminary to the
acceptance on the part of the State
Board of the new sewer plat 01 wau
seon, recently submitted to that
Board.
Mr. Durrell stated that the State!
Board of Health considered the solu-!
tion of the problem of an adequate
water supply for Wauseon as 01 nrst
importance to our village and lnti-
mated that tie Board would co-oper-
ate with local officials toward the so
lution of that problem.
Just what the solution would be
Mr. Durrell did not state but several
different lines were suggested by him.
FOR COURT OF APPEALS
Judge Bernard F. Brough, who is
a candidate for Judge of the Court
of Appeals, is a man who would bring
to that important office a' highly
specialized ability along judicial
lines. '
Although still a young man he is
fortv-five years
of age he has had
u " j i 7
1905. when he was appointed Judge
of the Toledo Police Court by Gover
nor Herrick.
It is not too much to say that in
the eleven intervening years, during
ten of which he has been Judge of
the Court of Common Pleas, Judge
Brough has received a training given
to few jurists of his age.
It is equally true that this train
ing by the State should now prove of
the highest advantage to the State;
in the wise and expeditious disposal
of causes brought to so important
a tribunal as the Court of Appeals.
Judge Brough is a man's man. He
is neither a recluse nor a bookworm,
but brings to his daily work a mind
freshened and kept up to date by
contact with both business and legal
circles. He is a great out-of-doors
man, who works hard and plays hard,
thus preserving the physical balance
that is necessary if professional abil
ity is to be kept unhampered by
bodily limitations.
After his graduation from the To
ledo High School in 1889, he four
years later, received his degree from
the Law Department or the Universi
ty of Michigan.
Twelve years of general law prac
tice followed, which fitted him ad
mirably for the position of Assistant
City Solicitor and Folice ITosecutor,
While serving in this capacity in
1905 he was appointed Judge of the
Police Court by Governor Herrick to
fill a vacancy, and one year later was
elected Judge of the Court of Com
mon Pleas.
' At the conclusion, of his first term,
in 1912, he was re-elected and is still
serving. .
Judge Brough was the son of a Vet-
eran of the Civil War, and is him

AUTO ACCIDENT
Auto Turns Over in Ditch Walter
Praii Pinned to Earth By Big
Studebaker. i
Two Toledo parties were caught
in a rather serious auto accident las
Tuesday near the Jerry Williams
farm. Messrs. E. K. Fisher and
Walter Prall were driving east by
the Jerry Williams farm at about 10
o'clock Tuesday forenoon when ' the
machine ,a large Studebaker owned
by Mr. Fisher got out from under
his control ran into the ditch and
onto a Page woven wire fence in
the recoil the machine was overturn
ed, Mr. ' Prall was thrown out and
caught under the machine; the edg
pf the windshield catching him across
the side of his neck and pinning him
to the ground. Mrs. Williams came
to the rescue and Succeeded in ga
thering others to help lift the car
from Mr. Prall who was in an un
conscious state. Dr. G. W. Hartman
was called and fortunately a train
ed nurse was in the neighborhood and
was brought to the injured man who
was placed on a cot and taken into
the Williams' home, later he was re
moved in an ambulance to the Wau
seon Hospital. He showed no signs
of returning consciousness until about
7 o'clock Tuesday evening. . Later re
ports indicate that he will recover
but he was very seriously injured and
undoubtedly it, was only prompt aid
rendered by the doctor and nurse that
saved his life. Mr. Fisher was un
injured; the car was damaged to the
extent of a bent front axle and bent
mud guards; it was brought to Morn
ingstar's Garage for repairs.
The family of Mr. Prall came down
from Toledo to see him at the Hos
pital Tuesday evening.
Messrs. Fisher and Prall were on
their way from Toledo to Continen
tal when the accident occurred, they
had been directed in Wauseon as to
the road to Napoleon but in some
way became confused and were go
ing East toward Toledo when ruts
in the road made it difficult for Mr.
Fisher to guide, the car and he lost
control.

would have stopped passenger trains,
the controversy related to men oper -

or another, there is delay, and the I
run takes eleven or twelve hours, the
men receive one or two hours of pro
rata overtime pay. The demand of
the men in the recent controversy was
not for shortening of the runs, but
for a change in the way of comput
ing wages. They demanded that
overtime should begin with the com
pletion of eight hours, and that the
rate of pay for overtime should be
50 per cent, greater than the pro
rata hourly pay. To take the case
of a man now earning $5.00 a day:
If he should happen to be out twelve
hours, he now receives $6.00, this in
cluding two hours overtime at 50
cents an hour. If the demands of
the men were fully granted, this
worker would receive $5.00 for hav
ing been out eight hours. His over
time pay would be based upon one
eighth of the day's wage, and would
therefore be 62 cents plus 31'A,
or 93 3-4 cents per hour. If, then,
he should be delayed, as in the case
we have already mentioned, and thus
work for twelve hours, he would re
ceive $3.75 for overtime and $5.00 for

THE FARM CREDIT BILL
Congress has passed it and the President has signed
it. So far so good. But the underlying principle of
getting a loan under the regulations of this new bill, is
after all, a good reputation, ability and resources upon
which to obtain the loan.
i
The same old rule: the rule that has determined the
making of any loan from time immemorial.
Any farmer, any man, can build up for himself a
credit standing that will entitle him to the confidence
and the financial assistance of his fellow men.
As the bank is one of the principal institutions
through which men build up their credit rating we invite

MRS. GEORGE SCHAMP.
Amanda Hortansa Barnes-Schamp,
youngest daughter ; of Leonard P.
and Mary Ann. Barnes,' was born near
Wauseon, Ohio, April 14, 1857, and
died September24,- 1916, aged fifty
nine years, five' months and ten days.
She was one.' of a family "'of ..twelve
children in which .there . were seven
brothers and five sisters. But two
of the largV' family "survive, William
C. of Toledo and Winfield Scott of
near Delta, , ..
September 30, 1880, she 'joined for
tune in life with Mr. Geo. Schamp, al
so of Wauseon, and !it was permitted
to them to live and to love almost
thirty-six years. Saturday of tihs
week would have been their wedding
anniversary. Their children,: Stella,
Dola and Roy, all living and all pres-1
ent.- bear ' testimony that a devoted
and true mother once was but is no
more. Their earliest memory of her
is her solicitude in teaching them to
pray and their' latest memory shall
be her joy in the personal salvation.
She was a good mother and model
wife. When only 15 years of t age
she was converted but did hot unite
with the churchuntil December 23,
1894, under the pastoral 6f Rev. Lan
dis, April 13, 1902, she 'transferred
her membership to , the ' Methodist
church of WauSeon' arid therein lived
out her days." She was an active in
terested, . consistent christian, living
and serving as long as she eauld.
About ten years ago she. was the
subject of a series', of serious oper
ations, . which' although thev furnish
ed temporary relief, were, the 'sure be
ginning ;of . the certain end." About
four years ago she struck the steeper
decline ' which "soon ' broueht" her" to
death's door.. For years as ysu know
a fog had gathered round about her
which lifted, now and then giving her
a few lucid, moments. It will remain
the abiding joy of the family to re
member that at si recent and last
such moment, she said, "I am "pre
pared and ready to go, I know 1 am
saved and safe." The end was Peace
ful and she sleeps in' Jesus.'

By the President of The United
States Appointing October 21st and
22nd as Days Upon "Which People
of United States May Aid Syrian
and Armenian People.
The condition of the exiled Syrians
and Armenians in Turkey, Persia,
Syria and Palestine beggars descrip
tion. Half a million children are star
ving. Details of conditions are too
horrible to publish. The President's
Proclamation which we publish here
with in an abbreviated form, speaks
for itself, it ought to appeal to every
American, 'young and old, rich and
poor alike.
Give, what you can through your
church or Sunday School. Don't let
your pastor or Sunday School Super
intendent side track this matter its
more important even, than new song
dooks or a carpet tor the prayer meet
ing room.
"Whereas, I have received from the
Senate of the United States a reso
lution, passed July 7 (calendar day,
July 10), 1916, reading as follows:
"Resolved, That appreciating the '
sufferings of the Syrian people,, it
is suggested that the , President of
the United States set aside a day
upon which a direct appeal to the
sympathy of all American citizens
shall be made and an onDortunitv
shall be given for our public-spirited
people to contribute to a much-needed
fund for the relief of the Syrian peo-'
pie."
And -Whereas, a resolution was
passed by the Congress of. the Unit
ed States on July 18, 1916, reading
as follows:
"ResolveS by the Senate (the
House of Representatives concurring-
that, in view of the misery,
wretchedness and hardships which
these people are suffering, the Presi
dent 'of the United States be respect
fully asked to designate a day on
which the citizens of this country
may give expression to. their sym
pathy by contributing to the funds
now being raised for the relief of
the Armenians in . the belligerent
countries."
And Whereas, I feel confident that
the people of the United States will
be moved to aid these people stricken
by - war, famine and disease; !
Now, therefore, I, Wopdrow Wilson
President of the United States, in
compliance with the said suggestion
of the Senate, and the said requests
of the - Congress thereof, do appoint
and proclaim Saturday, October- 21,
and Sunday, , October 22, 1916, as
joint days upon which the people of
the United States may make such
contributions as they feel disposed
for the aid of the stricken Syrian
and Armenian peoples.
In Witness whereof, I have here- -unto
set my hand and caused the seal
of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington
this thirty-first day of August, ki the
year of our Lord one thousand nine
hundred and sixteen, and of the In
dependence of the United States the
one hundred and forty-first.
(Seal) WOODROW WILSON."

Secretary of State.
