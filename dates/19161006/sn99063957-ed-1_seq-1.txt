HIGH GERMAN OFFICIAL
By Carl W. Ackerman,
(United Press Staff Correspondent.)
Berlin, Oct. fi. A submarine )lock-
nde of ceratiu English hariwrs was sug
gested to the government by several
leaders of the Von Tirpitz faction, ad
vocating a resumption of submarine,
warfare, it was learned today.
The Von Tirpitz supporters offered
this suggestion ns a compromise. They
urged that such a course would bo in
accord with the chancellor's announced
determination of prosecuting a vigor
ous war against England and would cut
off English food nnd ammunition sup
plies without endangering the lives or
property of neutrals.
The government is not impressed by
the suggestion .and there is no present
indication that it will be put into
force. The wrnuglo between the Von

AMBASSADOR GENERAL
BRINGS THIS REQUEST
Germany Willing to Consider
Terms Proposes to End
the War
New York, Oct. 0 Ambassador Ger
ard, according to the Kvening Post this
afternoon is bringing to President Wil
son nn application from Germany for
the president to use his good offices in
suing for peace. The Post's article
says:
"Germany has definitely decided to
apply to President Wilson to use his
good offices in suing for peace with the
nllie. This was learned today from
sources in a position to have absolutely
trustworthy information on these mat
ters. "It is understood that Ambassador
James W. Gerard, who is on his way
over here, will lay the kuiser's request
before President Wilson within a week.
"Important banking interests in close
touch with Germany's plans pointed
out today that a great many nations
were involved in the European conflict,
and hence, months might elapse before
peace would be finally consummated,
even in the event that President Wil-
son intervened as mediator.
"Ambassador Gerard is on board the
steamship Frederick VIII which left
from the other side on Saturday last
and is due uere..,jv,eording to officers
of the linn probably eu Tuesday next.
" Coroborration of the statement from
other sources on this side of the water
which might be described as 'highest
authority' came this afternoon to sub'
stuntinte tho belief in 'financial circles.
"Tho main statement, made with
great positiveuess todav, tends to con
firm the rumors that have been afloat
for months.
"It is a fnct, however, positively it
may have 'been denied officially that
the posmbilitv of President Wilson act
ing as mediator has been discussed by
Germnn officials with Ambassador Ger
ard. It is therefore by no means sur
prising tlfnt the reports now take def
inite shape m connection with Mr.
Gerard 'a trip to this country.

it 's really the women who count in any

A twinkleu came into her eyes, and
the set lines of her face relaxed.
: "Yes, the did stir things up a bit

riot incident. "Ypu know women are
queer." .

Just then tho telephone rang. A

"Oh, that's all right," she replied.

WOULD SENDPOLK
10 SOUTH AMERICA
Russia Would Depopulate Po
land by Sending Them to
America
Washington, Oct. 0. Russia is
negotiating with South Ameri
can republics for the coloniza
tion of over one million Rus
sian Poles in Latin America.
Five hundred thousand will be
distributed in Venezuela, Colom
bia, Kriindor, Poru and Bolivia,
if the Russian plans succeed and
the remainder will be placed iu
Argentine and Chile.
This was learned by tho Uni
ted Press today on unquestion
able authority.
' .
Washington, Oct. 0. Several months
ago a Russian commission of 12 mem
bers, en route to South America, came
to Washington, for certain letters of
introduction. They presented hero let
ters from Hudson Maxim, the explo
sives inventor and member of the IJu
pon Powder company and from Senator
O 'Gorman of New York.
They received letters to South Amer
ican personage from John Barrett, di
rector of the Pan-American Union. They
did not go to the stute department for
e.ny letters of recommendation.
Upon arriving in South America the
commission split up into three groups.
One, composed of Joseph Dnliudu, pub
lisher of a financial paper in Petro-
grad; and Marc Bounimouvitch, a Pctro
grud hanker, went to Cnrncas, capital of
, cnezucia, wticro they are not con
ducting the negotiations with tho min
istry of development.
At- first thev diBcussed purely cir
cumstantial matters, chiefly concerning
possible arrangements to purchase
Venezuela's entire yearly crop of cof-
fee, cocoa and mahogany direct from the
"- ., . .
iiiumnm-D m hm-ob itnr
Ruelau products through French ami
nussioners suggested that Russian cap
Hal would establish banks and a steam
ship line ami would send a diplomatic
representative to Venezuela. Similar
proposuls arc -understood to have beea
made or will be made to the other six
countries involved.
The organization in Venezuela nnd tho
other countries are, suid to be going
steadily forward.
The opinion has been expressed here
familiar with the negotiations thut Rus
sia wishes totally to depopulate Poland
of its native inhabitants, which liuvo
always been a political thorn in the sidol
of the government and re-people tho
land with north Kussiuus. The fuet that
thousands of the Russian Poles arc
of
German extraction is said to be a com
pelling reason for the scheme. On this
account, it is not believed the plan will
meet with ns much opposition from tier
many and Austria as it otherwise might.
The chief concern of the South Am
erican governments involved, is said to
be whether they want to risk flooding
their countries with thousands of aliens,
who might in a short time bo able to
dominate them politically ami commer
cially. On this account the Venezuelan gov-
j- eminent Tor one, is sain iu oe eonnuei
dJ ing the negotiations with great rare and
hesitancy.

300,000 CHEER WILSON
Omaha, Neb., Oct, 0. Presi-'
dent Wilson surely was given
a tremendous reception by the
peoplo of Nobrnska yesterday
afternoon. As viewed by old
time politicians, it was the
greatest demonstration he hao
received since taking office.
Three miles of solidly packed
humanity jammed along the -thoroughfares
of the city, ehoer
ed, shouted and applauded as.
the exocutive party passed.
- Windows, roofs nnd the com- .
ices of buildings were packed to
the danger point with men, wo
men and children. Officials de
clared 300,000 peoplo saw him.
All street car traffic wnji tied
ut for an hour in every direc
tion and all efforts to clear the
streets of people, automobiles
and carriages proved fruitless.
Withal perfect order was main
tained by scores of policemen on
foot, horseback and riding se-,
torcycles.
Throughout the long "avenne
of demonstration the president,
stood in his automobile, hat in
hand, bowing and waving ack
nowledgements. Now and then
Mrs. Wilson stood also and was
always greeted with a roar of
welcome. -

. The demonstration accorded his ev
ery appearance wus unique in the his
tory of the. Nebraska metropolis, Ne
braskans declared. It reached a climax
last night when thousands lined the
streets of Omaha until a late hour to
cheer him. The great auditorium was
jammed to the doors to hcur hiin.
But outside of the crowds, which,
might hnve flocked to pay tribute tc
any executive, the .president's friends
pointed to the outbursts of the audi
torium throng. . Question after question
sprung from thut audience, uxh oue
hailed with an outburst of cheering.
"Who kept us out of the wart" wus

"Wilson," came the unswering
voices.
"Who saved the nation!''
Agniu "Wilson."
"Who prevented the great striae!"
"Who gavo us the eight hour day!"
"Who gave us the rural credits!" .
Were nsked and always with applause,
the answer "Wilson."
The first mention of the president's
name by Governor Morehcad in his in
troductory speech, his appenrnnee in th
auditorium and his rising to speak, each
were heralded by nn ovation lasting
several minutes.
These things the president's cam
