NEW OIL REFINERY.
An oil refinery is to be built in Lou
isville to care for the output of forty
four petroleum wells which have been
drilled and are being operated ufcr
cessfully In Estill-co Kentucky, ac
cording to annyincement where 2,500
barrels of high-grade oil are being pro
duced dally.
It Is the intention of the company to
build on Independent refinery here and
ship a large part of their, production
hero, either by rail or river, as both
gleans of communication are accessi
ble to the field. The company intends
operating its own bnrges on the Ohio
river. Kstill-co. is comimratlvely a
new oil field, as. development began
there only a year ago. Twenty-four new
wells ore said to have been doveloped
within the past ten days.
Kstill-co. is said now to be the most
ft o tire oil district east of the Missis
sippi. For the past two months Ken
tucky is credited with lending all the
high-grade fields of the country In new
production development. Tho oil pro
duced Is high grade, being worth $1.95
per barrel. The principal oil stratum
lies at the shallow depth varying from
about 250 to 800 feet. Jn this field the
cost of drilling a well ranges froi
about $500 to $1,500, as against $,"i,00
to $.10,000 In ether localities. It is sutld
to be the cheapest known drilling.
The range of production from th
new wells is said to vary from ten to
250 barrels each of oil per day. So
greatly has the production In this field
increased that the Cumberland Pipe
Line, which Is said to be the Standard
Oil subsidiary, operating in that field, ,
is unable to take care of anything like
the total production. Courier Journal. ,

tiful home "Beech Moore" where she
has lived for many years. At nine p. m.
the night before Mrs. Moore was 89
years of age and was born at Guyan
dotte, W. Va.
As a girl she was counted exceeding
ly handsome and charming, and at her
extreme age she was still a beautiful
woman. But It was her gentle manner
and her sweet and sunny disposition
that niado her beloved by alL She wan
charitable to the pour and no one who
asked alms went away unaided from
her door. It was a pleasure to be with
her at her home. She was so cheerful
and Interesting, was well informed on
the general news of the day and con
versed fluently on all things about her.
Her illness was of but three days'
duration and her death was due to
pneumonia. '
She Is survived by four daughters,
Mrs. James Patton, Mrs. Minnie and
Lydla Moore of Catlettsburg, and Mrs.
Eugene Buftlngton of Chicago, all of
whom were with her when the final
summons came, excepting Mrs. Bull -lngton,
who will arrive later. One
sister also survives, Mrs. Virginia
Ricketts of Huntington, W. Va,

age, she being past ninety, she was
not able to attend the funeral. The ob
sequies were held at 1:30 p. m., Sun
day at her late home, Burial in the
Ashland cemetery where rests her hus
band and others who preceded her to
the spirit land.
"I cannot say, and I will not say,
That she is dead she is Just away.
TVith a cheery amile and wave of the
" hand.
She has wandered into an unknown
,' land,
And left us dreaming how very fair
It needs must be, since she lingers
-. there.".1'

IS CALLED20FF
LAWRENCE COUNTY FAIR ASSO
CIATION DECIDES TO GIVE
UP THE PROJECT.
The Lawrence County Fair Associa
tion decided Wednesday to call off the
fair which was to have been held'
Thursday, Friday and Saturday of next '
week at Louisa. It was found that the
necessary preliminary work bad not
been done and could not now be ac
complished, and rather than have It
a failure the committee decided to
give It up for this year. Everybody
connected with the enterprise Is too
busy to contribute the necessary time
to make It a success. Another fact is
that the new arrangement of the
Circuit Court was found to come at tbe
same time selected for the fair and tha
use of the Court house could not be
had.
We are Informed that the officers
are planning to start work In January
for a fair next fall, with the Intention
of having a much better one than ever
before.'.
Mr.1 James H. Woods made a trip to
the Bluegrass region last week and .
purchased seven of the twelve
thoroughbred bulls which he was ap- .
pointed to buy for distribution In this
county, Two have arrived. The others
will be here soon. .
