Denies It was a "Force Bill" Cum
mins Explodes Willcox's Dis
covery in Child Labor
Law.
United States Senators Rob
ert M. LaFolIette of Wiscon
sin, and Albert B. Cummins of
Iowa, both Republicans, have
furnished the sensation of the
campaign by joining in general
bombardment of Candidate
Hughes. In no uncertain terms,
Senator LaFolIette denounces
the Hughes charge that the
Eight-hour law for railway
trainmen was a "force bill." In
a signed statement. Senator
Cummins has exposed the utter
falseness and partisan unfair
ness of the recent Republican
attacks upon the Child Labor
Law.
Thus two more issues which
candidate Hughes has attempt
ed to raise are riddled, and from
within its own political camp.
In "LaFollette's Magazine"
for October, the Wisconsin Sena
tor charges that millions of dol
lars were expended by the rail
roads, during the pendency of
their negotiations with the
trainmen, in an effort to influ
ence public sentiment against
the demands of their trainmen
for an eight-hour day.
Not a "Force Bill"
"These millions did not come
from the profits of the railroad
managers or the railroad own
ers," says Senator LaFolIette.
"They came from the funds of
the treasuries of the railroads.
This campaign was conducted
with money that really belong
ed to the people."
"This eight-hour law has been
called a 'force bill,' enacted un
der the demands of organized
railroad trainmen," continues
Senator LaFolIette. "This is
not true. Congress, disinterest
ed, under law bound to consider
only the public good, was forced
to act in the public's interest. It
was not forced to act because of
any demands upon Congress by
the workingmen or by the rail
roads, but because the public
interest demanded immediate
action.
"Congress acted. It passed
what is known as the Eight
hour Law for men in the em
ployment of railroads in inter
state commerce, engaged in
moving trains. Every Wiscon
sin Representative present vot
ed for the bill, which became a
law and averted the strike. . I
believe they did right. I believe
in the eight-hour day.
"It is claimed that Congress
acted without due consideration.
Did it? The question of the
eight-hour day for skilled em
ployees was not new. Every
congressman alive to the issues
of the day must have been fair
ly familiar with the arguments
pro and con on the subject of
the eight-hour day." .
Willcox's Joker a Myth.
Characterizing the alleged dis
coverey by Chairman Willcox of
the Republican National Com
mittee of a "joker" in the Child
Labor Law as "without any
foundation whatsoever," and
stigmatizing the persons who
have been giving them publicity
as "either insincere or incom
petent," Senator Cummins rid
dles the preposterous claims of
both Mr. Hughes and his cam
paign managers and declares
the Child Labor Law as enact
ed by Congress and signed by
President Wilson is certain to
"effecutate the humane purpos
es toward which the friends of
child labor legislation have for
a long time been striving."
Senator Cummins's statement
is not only a complete answer
to these Republican attacks, but
is a timely and stern rebuke to
those responsible for giving
them publicity. His views are
set forth in a letter to Owen R.
Lovejoy, General Secretary of
the National Child Labor Com
mittee, written Sept. 23.
If Republicans are making any
such charge against the law in
order to discredit the adminis
tration," Senator Cummins
says, "the effort is disreputable
and must react upon those who
are foolish enough to give cur
rency to the charge." The Bulletin.
SCHMELZERS HELPLESS
BEFORE SANDERS
Got Only 3 Hits Off Blue Pitcher.
Howe's Hit Feature.
The Schmelzers of Kansas
City, who twice this season
smeared the local team with a
coat of whitewash, came back
Sunday, as strong as before,
but took back, the short end of
a 3 to 2 score.
Lexington was the first
to score in the sixth, on a single
by McKnight, Steven's sacrifice
bunt, Sanders free ticket to first
and a three base wallop over the
center fielder's head by Howe,
McKnight scoring, but Sanders
was thrown out on a close play
at the plate. They added their
other counters in the eighth, one
of them being a home run by
Stevens. This was the first
home run this season inside the
fence.
Schmelzers got only three hits
and did not score until the ninth
when the first man up was safe
on Campbell's error, two two-
base hits followed, which scored
their pair of runs.
Roy Sanders of the Kansas
City Blues and one of the best
pitchers in the American Associ
ation, was in the box for the
locals and held the Schmelzers
helpless. He allowed them three
hits and struckout thirteen. San
ders and Mike Reagan, also of
the Blues go to to National Lea
gue next season with the Cincin
nati Club. The Athletics got
eight hits off Whalen. The visi
tors made two errors and the
home team two.
Everyone in the stands was
afraid Howard Shinn could not
hold the boy from the big show,
but "Shinney" was on the job
and caught an excellent game.
He also fattened his batting
average by getting a double and
a single.
Batteries : Kansas City, Whal
en and Hannon ; Lexington, San
ders and Shinn.
Darnall-Elkins.
E. M. Darnall and Miss Han
nah K. Elkins both of Dover
were married Saturday evening
at 7:30 o'clock at the Baptist
parsonage. Rev. G. G. Riggan
officiated.
