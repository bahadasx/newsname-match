Hdward S. Curtis, well known Indian photographer,
author and friend of the late J. P. Morgan, filed suit
for divorce against her husband Friday in the superior
court. »
Mrs. Curtis alleges in her complaint that her in
ternationally known husband has ceased to care for
her during the last 10 years of their married life and
that he has associated with other women.
She says that he has totally disregarded her and
after abandoning her refused to write.
"He made every effort," Mrs. Curtis said, "to turn
the children against me by false stories. He has com
pletely refused to tell me anything about his business
and has so arranged it that my eldest daughter has been
so connected with the photograph gallery on Second
ave. that I have been unable to get money enough to
live on."
