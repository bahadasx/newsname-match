To Those Who Drive

constantly increasing number of au
tomobile accidents at grade crossings
prompts the issuance; of this warning

are unavailing.

There is a Real Difference
Cream of tartar, derived from grapes,
is used in Royal Baking Powder because'
it is the best and most healthful Ingredient
known for tho purpose.
Phosphate and alum, which are de
rived frdm mineral sources, aro used in
some baking- powders, instead of cream of
tartar, because they are cheaper.
If you have been induced to use baking
powders made from "alum or phosphate,
use Roal Baking Powder instead. You
will be pleased with tho results and tho
difference in tho quality of the food.

What Are You Doing?
What are you doing fortius town?
What are you doing to justify your
citizenship in this town?
You can not sit down, criticise, let
others do the work that makes a town
or community, and still call yourself
a. good citizen.
The good citizen never thinks only
of self. He must necessarily think
of self or he would not survive, but
good. citizenship requires more than
that much more
It requires that you keep in' mind
that there are others who have rights
respected by .others- by you. On
the same basis you are entitled to
have your rights equally respected by
them.
That is good citizenship -partial
iy-'
In addition, the good citizens re
members that this town is entitled to
his best efforts in its behalf, to the
end that the interests of the commu
nity riioy be advanced by all legitimate
means
I his means, too, that in advancing
the interests you are advancing your
own winch is the ultimate aim ot the
human race
What, then,sare you doing to con-
stitute yourself a good citizen?
Vote yes on the bond issue.
