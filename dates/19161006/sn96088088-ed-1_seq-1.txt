aware 'he was to be changed from
Dallas to some other point, and in
asking tltat Springfield be made the
choice of the next meeting he did so
because he did not wish to saddle a
big convention of this kind upon a
new man here. Had Rev. Bennett re
mained in Dallas this city would, with
out doubt, have been host to 200 or
more Oregon ministers next fall.
Fire Does $30 Damage.
Fire at the J. C. Gross farm home
on Red Prairie, 10 miles north of here
and 7 miles. south of Sheridan, last
week Wednesday did damage to the
amount of $30 in the kitchen before
it was discovered. The fire was
thought to have started from live to
bacco ashes which fell into a drawer
in the dutch kitchen the evening be
fore. The family was awaked at four
in the morning by smoke and put out
the blaze before it bad spread to any
extent. A. V. R. Snyder was out
yesterday and adjusted the loss, a
few cents less than $30.
Reports Cabbage Plentiful.
Felix Comegys brought in a wagon
load of cabbage from his farm be
tween Perrydale and Ballston yester
day. He says the ton which the wag
on held, was taken from his garden
and hardly made a hole in the patch,
so plentiful is the vegetable.

Falls' City Company Put Logging
Crews to Work Monday.
Cutting of timber by the Falls City
Lumlber & Logging company, the new
owners of the former Falls City Lum
jber company, began on Monday of
this week when several logging crews
were put to work in the company's
timber, about seven miles back of
Falls City. Announcement has not
been made as to the extent of timber
to be cut this year, but it is expect
ed that train crews will soon be put
on the company's railroad to haul the,
logs to tlhe mill pond at the big Falls
City mill. It is stated that a large
quantity of the logs will be banked
until more definite arrangements lore
made for the mill's opening, and for
that purpose large derricks are now
being erected at the mill pond for-piling
the logs" as they are brought in.1
Repairs on the mill proper are also
being made, and a shay engine is be
ing overhauled and rebuilt for the
coming work.
Expect to Ship Out Seven or Eight
Carloads to California and
Eastern Markets.
Ewing Brothers began packing ap
ples at the Barham warehouse yes
terday morning for the Polk County
Fruitgrowers' association and are at
present employing five experienced
girls in handling the fruit for them.
This year's pack will be composed
principally of Kings, Baldwins and
Spitzenbergs, although some North
ern Spys, Ben Davis, King1 Davis,
Winter Bananas and Rome Beauties
will be boxed.
The apple crop is quite large this
season with the color good and the
quality good where orchards have had
proper eare. The quality on the
whole, however, will be that of the
average year.
Seven or eight carloads will be
packed by the firm, all of which are
shipped through the Western Oregon
Fruit Distributors' association. Some
of the apples will go to California
and the balance to eastern markets.
It is expected that it will take about
three weeks to conclude the pack, and
the first car will go out the fore part
of next week.

did myself."
Grant Borford Injures Hand.
While chopping wood at his home on
Bnrrh street Tuesday evening Grant
Burford rut bis left hand. The wound
required 11 stitfhes by Dr. Bollman.
"Careless and incorrect methods
of construction were probably chief
ly responsible for the failure," is a
sentence taken from the report of C.
B. McCullough, enginees, of the Ore
gon Agricultural college, after, an in
vestigation of the Independence bridge
failure.
"For this careless construction the
contractor is in a large measure re
sponsible but the county is in a minor
degree responsible (morally at least)
in that careful inspection was not in
sisted upon," continues the report
made to County Rondmaster Finn.
At the request of Roadmaster Finn
Professor McCullough made a thor
ough inspection of the Independence
bridge after the collapse. He took
samples of the concrete from the col
umns, bars, slabs and other portions
ond these were submitted to Profes
sor S. H, Graf of the college who sub
mitted them to compression and chem"
ical tests.
The report says that the design of
the bridge was not faulty.
"There is no data to warrant the
belief that the cement was in any
way responsible for the failure" says
the report.
Finer sand than should have been
used was mixed but this defect, alone,
did not cause failure, according to
the report.
"Portions of the concrete in thu
nest column, immediately adjacent to
he point of failure, show a very
marked segregation of materials.
There were sandy streaks interbanled
with streaks of very, rich mortar near
ly neat cement. Near this point was
found a large pocket of material
which was apparently nearly devoid
of cement and very friable..,vA sam
ple was taken and analyzed in the la
boratory. The results, while only
roughly approximate, fully confirmed
the indication of the general appear
ance, iue proportions as louna were
of about one part of cement; 17 paits
of sand; and 34 parts stone. A sand
pocket of this kind could have but
two explanations ; improper and care
less proportioning or lack of thor
ough mixing.
"The bond between aggregate ana
mortar was everywhere found1 to be
eery poor and connected lines of air
voids surrounding the stone were ev-.
trywhere apparent. Such a condition
could have but one explanation: the
concrete was deposited too wet and a
film of excess water (not forced to the
surface by a thorough working of the
mass) had, upon being slowly drawn
to the surface, left the aggregate sep
arated from the mortar by a line of
connected air voids.
"In view of these facts it is not
surprising that the structure failed,
in fact the surprising fact is that
more concrete of this type does not
fail."
The conclusion and recommendation
of the report follows:
1. The failure of the bridge at In"
dependence was the result of careless
and incorrect methods of placing the
concrete.
2. The contractor is in a large
measure responsible in that he did not
exercise' due precaution.
3. The specifications are in part
responsible in that they did not defi
nitely provide for a method of plac
ing concrete through the "tremie."
4. This last fact may be excused
in view of the fact that all specifi
cations are written to be interpreted
through careful and intelligent in
spection and it is some times the part
of wisdom to leave details such as
these to the inspector.
5. The county is in part respon
sible, at least morally, in that they
did not insist upon inspection and
thus give the contractor the benefit
of expert supervision and advice.
In s preface to the report Profes
sor McCullough wrote that, in his
opinion, the incident served a valu
able purpose in showing the folly and
shortsightedness of any policy that
economizes on engineering and in
speetional services at the risk of such
failures as the Independence bridge.
The county court took no action on
the report at the regular session Wed
nesday thoutrh the report was received
by them. The court sat in special
session yesterday in Independence to
consider Professor McCullough 's findings.
The Observer publishes the news.
