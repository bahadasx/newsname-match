HIGH SCJIOffl. TRANSACTWWSOf IHECOIiKCH.
ORDER SEVERAL STREETS FIXED
—WILL BUY MORE FIRE
HOSE
The city council held a regular
monthly meeting at the city hall Mon
day evening, all aldermen except
Johnson and Farrow present.
L. V. Tanner, as agent for the Tan
ner estate, was granted a permit to
replace the fireproof roofing on the
St. Paul store building with new fire
proof roofing.
Geo. Moeglein, Sr., was granted a
permit to put a fire-proof roof on a
small building on First avenue south
east, between Kidder and! First streets.
Alderman Falk told the council that
Mrs. A. Kobbe had requested that
some arrangements be made for the
payment of her sewer assessment in
five annual pay ments. The city clerk
stated that the assessments had been
turned over to the county auditor some
time ago and that therefore nothing
could be done. City Attorney Rosen
meier said that the county officials
are very reluctant about making any
changes after the figures have once
been entered, therefore nothing was
done in the matter. The total amount
of the assessment was $20.
The report of Municipal Judge Ly
on with a receipt for $2 attached was
accepted! and ordered filed.
A petition by residents on Ninth
and Tfenth streets southeast asking
that something be done to drain their
property, was referred to the street
committee. The propertv rererred to
lies near the Sam LaFond home and is
hollow. A pipe was put in several
years ago to drain the land, but it is
claimed that the pipe was not put
down deep enough.
City Clerk Schallern was instructed
to advertise for bids for 1,000 feet of
fire hose. There is only about 2,300
feet of hose at the city hall and 2,000
of this must be kept on the fire truck
in order to keep the city in the fourth
class, leaving only a very small amount
for a change.
George Emder told' the council that
the lanterns which the fire department
has are ineffective in a dark place
where the smoke is thick and he asked
that a good searchlight be purchased
and placed on the fire truck, for use
at fires. The fire committee was au
thorized to get one.
Alderman Moeglein, chairman of
the street committee, reported that the
committee had inspected Fifth street
southeast in regard to drainage and
he said that the committee had icome
to the. conclusion that if the residents
along the street would put in side
walks the trouble would no doubt be
greatly relieved. As to First street
northeast, he-said that there is no use
of doing any thing with it up less some
binder "is first put on. TA lively dis
cussion as to what should be done on
the various streets followed and each
alderman had some street that he
wanted! fixed, until finally President
Hall had to halt the discussion, as a
number of propositions had been
brought up and were being discussed
at the same time. They then went
back to the beginning of the street
discussion, and, upon motion by Alder
man LaFond the street commissioner
was instructed to grade all of Fifth
street east and all of Sixth street
northeast except the block between
Broadway and First avenue. Alderman
Brown then moved thartu First street
northeast be fixed up with clay, 'gravel
or brickbats for a distance of three
blocks, one at a time, making the strip
eighteen feet widte. This motion car
ried. The street commissioner was
then instructed to put in three crush
ed rock crossing on First street north
east. Two of these are on the east
side of the street, one on either side
of the high school and the third
crosses the street.
Christ Van Buskirk of Sixth street
southwest asked that something be
done to take care of the surplus water
in that vicinity. He suggested that
the ditch on that street be cleaned out
and believed that this would relieve
the trouble. The matter was referred
to the street committee for investiga
tion.
The annual tax levy was made. This
will be found1 in another column.
The street sprinkling assessment
was confirmed. City Clerk Schallern
explained that for First avenue south
east,- where the sprinkling was not
started until later in the season, the
assessments were made on a pro rata
basis.
The sum of $400 was appropriated
for the repairing of the Pike Creek
road. The council advertised for bids
for this some time ago but received
none and therefore had the right to
make an appropriation in excess of
$200.
