Chairman Sees Mile and Half

Plans for enlisting the army In a
big scheme for the reclamation of low
waste and marsh lands aloug Kalaka
ua avenue, the federal government to
fill much of the area makai of the
avenue In conjunction with the work
on th mauka side by the territory
were given to the Star-Bulletin today
by Charles R. Forbes, superintendent
of public works.
Forbea intends, addition to this
work, to enlist the harbor commlssUon
in a plan to dredge much of the water
front along the Ala Moana road, using
the coral and sand thus obtained to
make a Splendid boulevard that will
run from the city incinerator as far
Waiklkl as the John Ena road. In a
rough estimate made ' today he said
that the road should' cpst not more
than $10,000 'a mile. There will be ap
proximately one and one-half miles of
it to construct.
Forbes Outlines Course
: l shall request through Gen Evans,
commander ' of the Hawaiian depart
ment, said Forbes in outlining his
plans, "that the medical staff of the
local department make a report on
the condition of property adjacent to
Kalakaua avenue from a sanitary
standpoint . , -
lf the report icldes that the place
Is unsanitary.' and. the department
commahder so", rcommendsi ; I. shall
then requestj.theCXederal government
to fill tbe? low ireaofJuulrnakaL of
Kalakaua. "that corresponds -.with the
land on the mauka side which will be
Included In Unit No. I, "Waiklkl Recla
raatloti. Project, for which we have
just completed plans' and specifica
tions." "; .
Governor Pinkham has been shown
these plans on the reclamation pro
ject and Is said to be favorable to
ward; them, having recommended
some such Ttfan several years , ago
when tie whs president of the terri
torial board of health.
"I intend to ask the legislature for
the boulevard along the waterfront,
and . I shall ask the harbor commis
sion to dredge the harbor In front of
it. -1 also hope to present to the leg
islature a report on the sanitation
fund and ask that It be Increased so
as to, complete several additional
units of ; the. big Waiklkl scheme,"
Forbes concludes.
Persons interested in a driveway
along the beach as outlined by Forbes
today, point out that it would furnish
a great place for yacht and boat races
if the harbor, was dredged sufficiently

fire.
Only north of Zobllno feeble detach
