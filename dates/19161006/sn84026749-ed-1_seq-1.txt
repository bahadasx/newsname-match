Negotiations on to Colonize Mil

sage to New Homes.
Russlt ! negotiating with South Amor
,lcan republics for the colonization ot
mare than 1.000,000 Poles In Latin-
America.
Five hundred thousand will be dls
trlbuted In Venezuela, Colombia, Ecua
dor, Peru, and Bolivia, If the Russian
plan succeeds, and the remainder will
be placed In Argentina and Chile.
Thla waa learned by the united Pressf
today on unquestionable authority.
Several months ago a Russian com-
tntwlon of twelve members, en route to
South America, came to Washington
fsr certain letters of Introduction. They
presented here letters from Hudson
Maxim, the explosives Inventor and
member of the du Pont Powder Com'
pony, and from Senator O'Gorman ot
New YorK.
They received letters to South Amer
ican personages trom John uarrctt. ai
rector of the Pan-American Union. They
did not go to tho State Department for
any letters of recommendation.
Split Into Groups.
After arriving In South America the
commission split up Into three groups.
One, composed of Joseph I.ellndc, pub
lisher of a financial paper In Petrograd.
and Marc Bounlmovitch, a Petrograd
banker, went to Caracas, the capital of
Venezuela, where they are now con
ducting tho negotiations with tho minis
try of development.
At first they discussed purely com
mercial matters, chiefly concerning pos
sible arrangements to purchase venc
luela'a entirely, yearly crop of coffee,
cocoa, and mahongany direct, from the
growers. Before tho war Russia
bought large quantities of these Vene
zuelan, products through French and
German houses, principal the latter.
It developed, however, that tho chief
object of their visit and the Russian
visitors wero frank about It, It Is said
was 'to obtain sanction of the Vene
zuelan government to the sending over
of hundreds of thousands of Russian
Poles to be sottlod on agricultural and
granting lands.
300 Acres For Each.
Under Venezuelan law these Immi
grants, If admitted, would each bo en
titled to 300 ncroa of government land.
The Russian government. It Is under
stood, Is prepared to subsidize the col
onists, paying their passago and provid
ing some capital for the purchase of
livestock, farm tools, etc.
Tho trade dlscussloln which the two
commissioners opened Is said to have
been to get the good-will of the Vene
zuelan government.
In addition to the suggestion of large
purchases, the commissioners suggested
that Russian capital would establish
banks and steamship lines, and would
pena a uipio-.nuc, rcprcseniaii ve 10
Venezuela. Similar proposals are un
derstood to have been made or Will
be made to the other six countrlos In
volved. The negotiations In Venezuela and the
other countries are said to be going
steadily foreward.
Tho opinion has been expressed by per
sons here familiar with the negatlations
that Russia wishes to totally depopullze
Poland of Its native Inhabitants, which
have always been a political thorn In the
side of the government, and re-people
the land with North Russians.
The fact that thousands of the Rus
sians Poles are of German extraction Is
said to be a compelling reason for the
scheme. On this account. It Is not be
lieved the plan will meet with as much
opposition from Germany and Austria
hk it otherwise might.
Tho chief concern of the South Amer
ican governments Involved Is said to be
whether they want to risk Hooding their
countries with thousands of aliens, who
mtgrTt In a short tlmo bo ablo to dom
inate them politically and commercially.
On this nccqun tho Venezuelan govern'
ment for one la said to be conducting
the negotiations with great care and
hesitancy.
Small Is Held for
Grand Jury Action
Broker, Whose Wife Was Slain in
Burned Cottage, Faces Fur
ther Inquiry.
MOUNTAIN VIEW, N, H., Oct. 6.
Fredorlck Small, charged with tho mur
der of his wife In their cottage here on
September 28, was held for the grand
Jury oday, after a brief review of the
case on both sides.
Today's session of court was devoted
to arguments of counsel, although It
was rumored when court convened that
nn Important witness would be called
tiv the defense.
The prosecution struck Its most telling
blow late yesterday. " when It showed
that Small had an inventory of every
artlcio in nis lime cottage wnere nis
wlfo'a body was found In his handbag
at the Boston Hotel, where he was ar
rested, and that h'e made an attempt to
conceal this list.
The testimony or rrea is. uean, a
culde. who was guarding the ruins of
the cottage the night of the fire, caused
a aansatlon In court. During his cross
examination, Small, by his actions, In
dicated that he looked upon the guide
as a possible suspect.
When the defense pointed to scratches
on the face of tho guide, small leaned
forward and gripped the railing fiercely
glaring at Bean. No attempt was made
by the defense, however, to cast sus
picion on the guide.
