PRESIDENT ON
WESTERN TRIP
Throngs Pack Stations at Every
Stop ? Admirers Tell Him
They Are Glad He Has No
Whiskers.
Chicago, Oct. 4.?President Wilson,
penetrated the Middle West today for
his speech in Omaha tomorrow, re?
ceived noisy welcomes from many
thousand persons in Ohio, Indiana und
Illinois. He interpreted the enthusi?
asm to one crowd us meaning "you
believe in me." At stop after stop the
railroad stations were packed; at sev?
eral places bands olayed and fre?
quently the president remarked on the
cordiality.
Refusing to turn his trip into u
speech-making tour, the president
nevertheless kept up a running fire of
remarks at every stop. Interest among
thoso who spoke to him centered)
most nbout the eight-hour law for
railroad employees.
Mr. Wilson made a stop at Chicago
tonight and conferred with Senator
Walsh, in charge of Democratic West?
ern headquarters; Senator Saulsburry
of Delewarc, manager of the sena?
torial committee atid other depart?
ment heads.
Several hundred persons, including
local politicians, railroad men and not
a few women flocked to the train
yards and cheered the president when
he appeared and shook hands with
those nearest him.
"More Than Satisfactory."
Senator Walsh told hint the cam?
paign in the West was "more than
satisfactory."
At every stop between Pittsburgh, j
passed early this morning, and Chi- |
cngo, the president appeared on the
rear platform of his private car,
waved to the crowds, explained that
he was making no speeches and then j
shook hands with as many as possible.
"I am before the jury and can't
say anything." was the way he ex?
plained his failure to speak in sev?
eral towns.
"I am not making a speech-making
campaign," said the president nt
Lima, Ohio, "but it touches mo and
gratifies me very much to get the
greetings I have all along the line and
Ohio has certainly shown her hos?
pitality."
"We didn't wnnt n speech; we
wanted to see our president," a man
called out.
"I don't think much of my speech
making, but I think it is better than
I am to look at," Mr. Wilson said.
"We want to sec Mrs. Wilson," a
man shouted.
"I'll admit she is better worth look?
ing at than I urn," replied the presi?
dent as he brought his wife forward.
Republicans For Wilson.
"I heard a Republican say today
he was going to vote for you," a man
called out at Wooster, Ohio.
"He must be a good man," retorted
Mr. Wilson.
"You were with us In the eight
hour day and v.? are with you," said
a man at Orrvillc, Ohio, a railroad
town.
"Good" the president replied.
When the president stopped at Vnl- |
pairaiso, Ind., tonight, a crowd, in?
cluding some students, drew him into j
n reference to Mr. Hughes' whiskers.
"I hnven't any speech to make," I
said Mr. Wilson. "I have never met
you before, but your manners are
very familiar. I am glad to see you."
A man in the crowd called out:
"Aren't we glad he hasn't got whisk- |
crs!"
"You are a clean shnven crowd
yourself," replied the president.
At Fort Wayne, the first stop
Indiana, Mr. Wilson said: "I haven't
anything to sny, my fellow citizens,
except that it is exceedingly refresh?
ing to get nway from official duties
and out among the folks again_ nnd
the sort of greeting you are giving
me fills my heart with a great deal of
gratitude. I am heartily obliged to
you."
A railroad brakeman, just off duty,
pushed out his hand and said: "Right
there, Mr. President. She's dirty,
but she's going to hit the rooster

Egg Story.
On the New York Stock Ex?
change Tuesday, the stock of
the Norfolk & Western sold nt
1.40, the highest over known in
the history of the road. The
rise in this stock is, of course,
caused by the prosperity of the
country, nnd directly by the
large amount of coal that is
being hauled by the railroad to
help in legitimate enterprises
in the North, South, East and
West. A great deal of the "prof?
its from the sale of this coal nt
unusually high prices is going
into the pockets of our Repub?
lican friends in the Ninth dis?
trict. How can they show such
poor business judgment as to
wish to change the order of
things from Wilson prosperity
to Hughes uncertainty.
We don't believe they'll do it.
To insure the continuance of
this condition, .take no chances
but vote for the man whose pic?
ture is at head of this article.
hard."
"God Bless You!"
At Warsaw, Ind., the president
said:
"It cheers me very much to have
you come out and give me such n
greeting because sometimes when I
am hard at work I long very much to
get away and come out nnd see the
folks. It gives mo the deepest grati?
tude if you want to see me and be?
lieve in me. God bless you and good
luck to you."
Edward G. Hoffman, of Fort Wayne
Democratic National Committeeman
from Indiana, rode for a while with
the president and Inter gave out an
informal statement in which ho
claimed that Indiana will cast its
electoral vote for Wilson.
"The president has a large per?
sonal following among Indiana Re?
publicans," Mr. Hoffman said. "The
Independent vote is for him solidlp
and he is assured of KG per cent of
the Progressive vote. Our citizens
do not believo In swapping horses in

MXORMICK SURE
WILSON VICTORY
Democratic Chairman Confident
President Will Be Re-Elected
on November 7 ? Hughes
Candidacy a Failure.
Now York, Oct. 1.?In a statement
issued this afternoon Chairman Vance
McCormick, of the Democratic Nu- j
tional Committee, says:
"Two things stand out eonspici
uously in the campaign so far. They
are the absolute failure of the Hughes
candidacy and the certainty that
Woodrow Wilson will he elected l'res
ident of the United States on No-1
vember 7 th.
"Reports I have recieved from all
parts of the country convince me that
the President has the people with
him, and that they arc going to back
him up with a fine big majority on
election day. And furthermore, they
are going to re-elect a Democratic
Congress to co-operate with him in
enacting more legislation in the in-,
terest of the people.
"In the East, the West, the North
and the .South the people are happy
and contented. The country is at
peace. Prosperity rules the land as
never before.. Factories arc working
to their limit. The bnnks. always a
barometer of business conditions, arc
bulging with deposits. President Wil?
son has brought peace and prosperi?
ty to the country, and that is why the
FORD SAYS MR. WILSON
W ILL GET VOTES OF THE
REAL PROGRESSIVES.
"The nation will he surprised
by the number of (hese inde?
pendents. I am convinced that
the "November election will wit?
ness the upsetting of parly lines
unprecedented in the history of
American politics. 1 was born
a Republican, you know, and
voted the Republican ticket for
many years, but I shall vote for
Mr. Wilson in November.
"I have talked with many
other Republicans who have re?
solved to do likewise. Mr. Wil?
son is assured of the undivided
support of the real progress?
ives of the nation.
"For several weeks the Re?
publican candidate has been per?
mitted to place a distorted em?
phasis upoa the eight-hour day
issue. f believe tiarcscrvedly
that President Wilson and his
administration arc on the right
side of this issue, both in the
sense of justice and popularity.
"The stamp of Wall Street,
of the interests which see thru
dollar marked spectacles, and
can think only in terms of sel?
fishness is upon the opposition
of Mr. Wilson. People may rest
assured if they defeat Mr. Wil?
son these men of Wall Street
will make the people pay back
the money with interest, and
maybe with their lives.
"The country is loo prosper?
ous and too confident of future
prosperity to listen seriously to
those who say we arc living in

people arc for him.
'My reports arc that tho Sonnte
will remain Democratic and that, the
Democratic majority will be increas?
ed to upward of fifty.
"The recent speech-making tours
of MY. Hughes have shown him in
his true light. His addresses have
been s continual tirade of fault-find?
ing; they have been evnsive; he has
advanced not a single constructive
idea; he has straddled on every ques?
tion of importance before the people.
Mr. Hughes bus tried hard to lind an
issue in his campaign, but has failed
dismally.
"The Republican nominee knows
that the President has the people with
him because he has acted merely as
their spokesman and has endeavored
to carry out. their wishes on all quoB
I tions affecting the welfare of the
country. On the other hand, the peo?
ple know that Mr. Hughes is the can?
didate of that small group of persons
who seek special privileges at the
expense of the people of the country
; ?that same group which wuh ram?
pant at Washington until Mr. Wilson
became President and restored the
government to the people.'

HOLSTON CONFERENCE.
Uluelield, W. Vu., Oct. -I?Special
Correspondence- The ninety third
session of the Holston conference is
in session at Grace Church, Minefield,
this week. About 2M) preachers and
delegates came to the city Tuesday
night. They were met by a cordial
reception committee nt thu depot;
thence conducted to the church in
automobiles, whence they were con?
veyed by automobiles to their respec?
tive homes. Thus the hosts were
spared the trouble of either mooting
their guests at either the depot or
church.
The writer is very happily placed
in tho hospitable home of Mr. and
Mrs. .1. R. Laird, formerly of Tnzc
well. Quite a number of Tazewell
people have been in attendance to?
day.
Thus far, Bishop Atkins has pur?
sued an original course?original in
the sense that it \x a departure from
the usual order. The song, "Nearer
My Cod to Thee," was led by the
Rev. J. C. Orr, after which the sac?
rament of the Lord's Supper was ad?
ministered; Bishop AtkillS made
short, appropriate remarks about, this
institution lind asked the secretary
of the former conference to call the
roll. The majority of the members
responded. Dr. J. A. Burrow was re
elected secretary with Dr. J. S. French
and Revs. E. A. Shugato and J. H.
Umbcrgcr, assistants. Committees
were then announced with time and
place of meeting, the hour of the con?
ference was fixed and hours for com?
mencing and adjourning stated. Then
the Bishop announced that two min?
utes for presiding elders and one
minute for preachers in charge would
be allowed for reports. Five dis?
tricts were heard from and the re?
ports showed a good year's work in
every charge. Many revivals have
been held, Sunday Schools have nour?
ished, work of the Missionary Socie?
ties anil finances have been very sat?
isfactory. After introducing promi?
nent visitors, including Dr. J. L. Hun?
ter, of the Richmond Publishing
House, Dr. Bennett, of Emory Uni?
versity, Atlanta, Git., and many oth?
ers, the conference adjourned prompt?
ly at 12 for dinner. It is said that,
more business was dispatched this
morning than ever before in the same
length of time at an annual con?
ference, Bishop Atkins is working a
most favorable impression as a pre?
siding official and all the preachers
are apparently in u happy mood.
One feature of the morning ses?
sion was the presentation through
Bishop Atkins by the Bluefiold Dis?
trict preachers of u Howard watch
to Rev. J. B. Ward, whose time as
presiding elder expires. Brother
Ward responding said they did not
give him the watch because he was a
"slow coach" but to keen him from
going too fast and outsteppping Ed.
Shugart and Sid. Vaught. Since a
further report of the conference can
not appear until after the final ad?
journment it may be well to slate
that the Tazewell District has a sur?
prise in store for Rev. D. P. Hurley,
their popular presiding elder, who
also ends his term.
Not much gossip is afloat yet about
appointments. It is rumored thnt Rev.
J. M. Carter, hosts of the conference
will succeed Rev. J. B. Ward, who will
succeed Dr. I. P. Martin, of Big
Stone Gap district who will succeed
P.ev. D. P. Hurley who will in turn
succeed Rev. E. II. Cnssidy, of Rad
ford district. Others favorably men?
tioned for the place to be vacated by
Brother Hurley, are; Revs. E. H. Cas
sidy and J. M. Carter. The chances
are that the pastors of the Tazewell
station and circuit will remnin.
Dr. Bennett of the Theological
faculty of Emory University prenehed
a most excellent sermon to a cap?
acity congregation at Grace street
church this afternoon. Tonight the
Sunday School Board will nave a
public meeting nt which the principal
address will no delivered by Bishop

candidacy of Mr. Trinklo. From the

the editor of the Graham Daily News
has been "caught with the goods," as
a great deal of the "stuff" published
under date lines from various places
seems to have been manufactured in
his own fertile brain.

SPIDERS WEAVING WIL?
SON'S NAME?INFALLIBLE
OMEN OF HIS ELECTION
An infallible sign of the elec?
tion of Woodrow Wilson us tho
next President of the United
States hau developed near North
Tazewell.
Two of the daughters of n
well known Republican living in
that community were rouming
over the hills last Sunday, and
happened upon a large spider
web, which had been woven by
a large golden spider. The work
of the spider was so beautiful
from an artists point of view
that the young ladies paused
to gaze upon it. To their as?
tonishment, a close scrutiny de
/eloped the letters W-I-L-S-O-N
as plainly visible in the center
of the web as if painted there
by an artist. The phenomenon
made such an impression upon
them that they told a number
of their friends nbout it.
This is said to be an omen of
the election of Mr. Wilson.
Bearing out this belief, sever?
al years ago, a young man from
North Tazewell, who was an
ardent supporter of Mr. Taft in
the election in which he was op?
posed by Mr. Bryan, was travel?
ing in the same community, and
observed n similar web, a close
scrutiny of which developed the
words T-A-F-T plainly woven
in the center of tno web by one
of the golden spiders. And Mr.
Taft was elected, too.
It is said that a number of
the friends of Mr. Slcmp have
searched ia vain for a web con?
taining the words S-L-E-M-P,
hut instead they run into webs
bearing signs of 40c wool, 10
cattle, etc. It has been noticed,
however, that none of the cob?
webs referred to nre growing
over the drift-mouths of any
of the coal mines in this sec?
tion.
