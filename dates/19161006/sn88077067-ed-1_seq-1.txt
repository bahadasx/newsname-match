RUBBINO IT IN
Undoubtedly the meanest thing Presl
dent Wilson can do to Col. Roosevelt Is to
make a speech on the same day thecolo
nel does, so that the two of them are
laid elilora the thoughtful reader in tne
same Issue of the paper. Ohio State
journal.
THE PRESIDENT'S INTERNATIONAL
POLICY
"In the crisis he faced, tho President
should have had the hearty support of ev
ery man, woman and child In America,
For It developed that Mr. Wilson pursued
exactly tho right course. Any other atti
tude of the President would have plunged
us either Into war or prolonged the sub
marine controversy. No matter what oth
er construction may be put, I say that
Germany's answer was an open admission
that Wilson was not only right, but fair.
Another President might have gone to war
with Germany, without sending any kind
of note. And we all ought to thank God
that there was a Woodrow In the White
House to withstand the pressure of the
war seekers on tiie one hand and tiie war
partlals on the other. Wilson's course
was the middle road, and he fearlessly
took that road. We have all much to be
thankful for for that .as true Americans
and with allegiance to one Mag, and one
ilag only." From Sneech of Hon. Charles
Lleb, of Indianu, In the House of Repre
sentatives, July 18, 1916.

ALAS, "POOR GOVERNOR HERRICK
The System, llanna and George II. Cox,
elected a "good" bunker, Myron T. H
rick. Poor Governor Herrlck! I say hint
noon after he entered otllce. He Is affab
le, but weak; everybody spoke well of him
tlii'il, ana he would nave done very well,
but they gave him the veto and then his
boss died. Hanker fashion, lie tried to
please everybody, make Incompatible pro
mlcs , tiled to escape, but was caught
naked In his weakness, and now evers bo
dy is too hard on him except the System
The System leaders make a wry face, but
they found him "safe." He carried out a
bargain Henna had made with the brew
ers. Without knowing tout there was
System, lie signed a bfll to trunsfer city
elections from the spring to thefall; after
telling me that he believed the Cleveland
School System was the ehst In the coun
try, he signed, itgalnst the protest of al
t tie earnest educators o fiite state, a bill
which put upon Cleveland and nil theoth
er cities, Cincinnati s big hoard plan
Herrlck was to lie renominated, there
fore, and he may lie re-elected. The Sys
tern has a strung hold on Ohio. "We
have tiie farmers always," said one of Its
leaders. Hut Ohio will escape. Lincoln
