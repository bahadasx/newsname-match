REPUBLICANISM.
The Bystander has been preaching
the great doctrine of unity, urging
my race to become more united upon
the great questions that effect onr
race as a whole. This year every col
ored voter ought to stand united man
for man to return the grand old re
publican party back to „po*er at
Washington. There is no other party
that has done as much for the Negro
as the republican party All the other
parties have ignored or eliminated the
Negro. It may sometimes seem to us
that the republican party has not doqe
all that it could do or even all it has
promised to us or that may be really
*due us. But the truth is that the re
publican party has done all that has
'been done to develop and assist us up
the hill. Then again they are asking
for our aid, while the democrats have
done all to retard our progress. Why
even Du Boies, who four years ago
hallowed his voice hoarse for Wilson,
comes out in this month's Crisis and
says the only thing to do is to vote
the republican ticket. We always
knew that Dr. Du Boies dealt in
theory and not in practical things.
We welcome.you, Mr. Trotter, and the
rest of the gang back hom*.
A GREAT AGRICULTURAL AND
INDUSTRIAL COLLEGE.
Located in the Heart of
Rich SoiL
Moreover, white farmers from many
parts of the state have purchased
pure bred Boone county white seed
corn and many county piapers have
written accounts of its successes and
have praised and recommended the
school to their colored patrons. Met
ropolitan papers, farm journals »nd
magazines hitherto not noticing Ne
gro farmers have come to rec9gnize
that a heavy Missouri liability of hu
man beings can make, is being made,
into a' record asset at this school and
out on farms by the work and meth
ods used by this school. This is some
gain if it only keeps up, increasing
and adding to it year by year. At the
ninth annual Negro Farmers' Confer
ence last February, Hon. Frederick D.
Gardner of St. Louis, Mo. Judge W.
K. James, our president E. B. Kel
logg, editor of the Chariton .Courie
A. F. Arrington, county surveyor

Missouri's
It was my good pleasure to visit
this school last year, also this year,
and to see the wonderful improve
ments made within one year leads the
thoughtful student of events to say
that this school is going to command
a greater influence and a higher de
gree of efficiency than the Tuskegee
because ,of its location and its fast
taking place at the head with Prof.
N. C. Bruce and his loyal wife and
able teachers. They are now building
a fine modern barn 40x60, holding
twenty head of cattle and twenty head
of horses, nearly completed, also have
built and filled with a hundred tons of
silage, are concrete monuments as
witnesses of this great result. In be
stowing "knighthood and awarding
the world's premium at the White
Corn Growers' Show this year the
gbvernor of the state among other
things said:
"The state is proud of this private
school's efficient, successful work
proud of the black boys and girls which
it isjightly training? back to their best
chance and hope prou3 of its chari
table citizens and other good men and
women who are promoting this school
through your good work and wise
leadership. Your school's corn exhibit
at California largely helped and hon
ored the entire state, the white race
as well as the black race, and the men
and women of affairs who have given
and will continue to donate to equip
and endow such a school to reclaim
the fast wasting Negro youths of Mis
souri along the purposes and mission
of this Bartlett 'farm school,' are
building more wisely than they know
by helping the least and most needy
of humanity of our great state." 'Tis
true, the large yield of corn, 114 bush
els to the acre, has not only led all in
the state of Missouri for the past
two years, but the exhibits at the Kan
sas Corn Growers' Show last Decem
ber, Governor Capper being present,
took first in that state. In January at
Tuskegee Institute the great Booker
T. Washington's school, in the South
ern Corn Growers' contest, 3,100 farm
ers contesting, the school won out and
received an earnest letter requesting
it to lend that school this year its
exhibit to be kept there as an inspira
tion to thousands of southern farmqrs
in developing quality in their corn.
Also by this school's good results the
United States, through its farm exten
sion and service department at the
Missouri university, have been in
duced to appoint and pay an expert
Negro farm agent. Professor E. N.
f^arrish, graduate of the Kansas Ag
ricultnral and Industrial school,
among other mechanics also, for six
months, ending in September, 1916,
$1,0 per month to extend the thor
ough-going, result-producing farm
work of the Bartlett Agricultural and
Industrial Si^iool among the 4,000 Ne
gro farmers of the state, locating him
with his headquarters at this school.
The state board of agriculture has
used the principal for lecturing to our
farmers when they could, and the Mis
souri university has become especially
interested in the school's work.

Mr. Gardner, one of the candidates
for the coming governorship, said: "I
am pleased and surprised beyond men
tioning at what my eyes ha^e actually
seen here today as a resfift of prac
tical and common sense education of
Missouri Negro youth. The world
Should know, and the Colored people
especially that Missouri at this school
has her own 'Tuskegee,' which is
splendidly solving the problem and
even leading that great -Booker T.
Washington school in successful farm
ing and in training colored youth back
to their own#est opportunity of pro
duction. It is truly inspiration, a
school worth while. I am a farmer
myself, was a poor farmer boy and
my sympathies must necessarily be
with all upward struggling peoples,
but especially all my life, brought up
and reared among colored people, as I
was, I have felt a keen desire to help
them make good citizens wherever and
whenever I can. Like Abraham Lin
coln, whether I ever hold office or not,
I here and now promise that I shall
deal justly and fairly with our col
ored people who, I now see, are just
as responsive and capable of being
helped as those in Alabama and other
soutern states. This Bartlett Agri
cultural and Industrial School as now
named impresses me as Missouri's
best solution of the so-called colored
problem. I shall help it equip and
grow and encourage all my friends to
aid it. It is gratifying to note the
growing confidence of the colored race
in the school's permanence and its
province of work. Three of the race's
members of the board of trustees have
furnished that number of rooms in the
new Adolphust 1 Memorial Boys'
building at the cost of $75, and Mr.
John Lange gave the first $100 to
wards the new barn.
N
Mr. Albert
Hicks has given $10 towards the up
keep this year and a pure bred Duroc
Jersey sow easily worth $25, has also
gotten his friends in Columbia to give
towards two verT useful farm im
plements. Others of the neighboring
people have given labor and food ma
terial to make that farmers confer
ence a success and there is a helpful
and appreciative awakening all along
the line among them."
The new teachers are Prof. M. R.
Powell, A. B., Howard university
Prof. R. H. Payne, A. M., Kansas uni
versity Mrs. A. ML_Fisher, Columbia.
These with Miss Maude D. Nelson ox
Louisiana, who' is teadter of music
Mr. M. F. Rollins, shoemaking and
harness departments, together with
the principal and his wife, compose a
faculty as capable as one can find in
the best white schools. All are men
and women though, highly educated,
yet joyfully do labor work necessary
to apractical school for doing things.
The United States through the Mis
souri State university has located
Prof. E. M. Parrish as farm agent ex
pert at this school and from this
school as abase he works out in north
central Missouri among Negro farm
ers. This also is a great gain. Stu
dents are in this school from many
counties from Arkansas, Oklahoma
and Illinois, and are pouring in daily.
This is truly a school for our people
worth while.
More Than Enough Is Too Much.
To maintain health, a mature man
or woman needs just enough food to
repair the waste and supply energy
and body- heat. The habitual consump
tion of more food than is necessary
for these purposes is the prime cause
of stomach troubles, rheumatism and
disorders of the kidneys. If troubled
with indigestion, revise your diet, let
reason and not appetite control and
take a few doses of Chamberlain's
Tablets and you will soon be all right
again. For sah by al'. dealers.
