WAR IS COMING
IN SHORT TIME
Seattle, Sept. 29.-United States
Senator James Hamilton Lewis of Illi
nois, Democrat senate whip, respond
ing to the toast, "Our Country," at a
non-partisan banquet given in his hon
or by citizens here, said:
"Our country is in an increasing
danger from her policies of national
preservation. The enforcement of the
Monroe doctrine against the future
new born Europe to prevent establish
ment in South America of the kingly
governments of Europe, and the en
forcement of the American exclusion
laws against all Asiatic citizens, means
war for the United States. She must
prepare to meet the conflict or prepare
to modify her only two fixed interna
tional doctrines. The American peo
ple do not understand either doctrine,
"The next great issue in America
will start from the Pacific, and will
arise from the demand that Japan will
make on her new European allies that
they exact of America in behalf of
Japan and China that the Asiatic peo
ple shall have from the United States
all that is accorded to these citizens in
Europe; while the European allies of
Japan will demand that Japan aid them
in opposing our Monroe doctrine in
South America.
The next great political campaign
will turn on the issue of whether
America will enforce her doctrines and
bear the expense of increased necessary
naval preparation and taking over of
the adjacent islands in all American
seas which could be used as bases of
attack by any foreign power against
the United States, or to avoid these
burdens, and qualify our Monroe and
Asiatic doctrines so as to allow the
world to come into America as we are
determining to go into the world.
"The first move in punishment for
us for our exclusion of Europe. from
South America and Asiatics from the
United States will be retaliation by
excluding our goods and restricting our
citizens from both countries. If we
resent this-as our people must-the
islands of the Phillipines and Hawaii
in the Pacific and Porto Rico and our
new Danish possessions in the Atlantic
will be siezed and the fight carried
there-as we siezed Cuba to fight
Spain. The mainland of our nation
will have little opportunity to aid in
land defense-the conflict will be a con
test of navies.
-The demand upon the United States
will be 'reciprocate or we will retal
late.' America must arouse herself
to her new situation-and by policies of
peace and statesmanship prepare to
meet it."
Standardization of Vehicles
In April of the present year a num
ber of the largest manufacturers of
axles, wheels and wheel material met
in Cleveland, Ohio, to discuss the pos
sibility of adopting standard patterns
and dimensions for all axles and wheels
used in horse drawn vehicle construc
tion. At that time another committee,
appointed by the Carriage Builders'
National Association, was already at
work on the standardization of the
parts that go to make up a body for the
popular carriage known as the Amer
ican buggy.
The result of the Cleveland confer
ence and the meetings which followed
it, was that a set of "standard speci
fications" have been drawn up, printed
and widely circulated among manu
fac'urers interested. These manu
fac'urers have been instructed to go
over the specifications carefully, and
suggest necessary changes or correc
tions. After sufficient time has been
allowed for the consideration of such
criticisms as may be offered by the
trade, the specifications will be printed
in large quantities, and distributed to
the entire wheel, axle, carriage, wag
on, jobbing and repairing trade.
Following this widespread notifica
tion manufacturers and jobbers will
carry in stock only such goods as con
form to the standard specifications.
All other sizes in spindle lengths,
flange and hub sizes, will be considered
as "odd sizes," and are not expected
to be carried in stock but will have to
be made up after receipt of orders.
It is claimed that the shortage of
material in the vehicle trades can only
be relieved by the adoption of stan
dard sizes in all the parts and materials
used in the industry. Manufacturers
of wheels, axles, malleable iron, and
the builders of wagons and buggies are
all expected to give the new standard
ssecifications their approval and help
to establish vehicle standardization on
a permanent basis. Every carriage
and wagon builder in the United States
larg' and small, should be interested in
this plan for the conservation of raw
material and the saving of time and
labor which are involved in the vehicle
standardization plan.
Things Doing in Montana
Montana will ship to St. Paul mar
ket 15,000,000 bushels of wheat.
Copper to the amount of 440,000,000
pounds from Montana mines reported
sold to the allies for next year's de
livery at 25 to 27 cents per pound.
Northern Pacific started to build a
35 mile branch to the Lake Basin coun
try north of Columbus.
The Havre Democrat thinks the rail.
road boys have been handed a gold
brick just before election.
The Montana-Utah Sugar company
announces that they will build a fac
tory in Hamilton in time for next
year's beet crop.
A $12,000 plant will be erected in
Great Falls for the Montana Macaroni
Manufacturing company.
The Cutbank Pioneer-Press advo
cates "the elimination of those political
parasites, the deputy game wardens."
"If what the politicians say about
each other is true, the outlook for this
country is dark indeed," says the
Whitefish Pilot.
Montana's 1916 wheat crop will be
worth $40,000,000.
Great Falls lands two more indus
tries-the Western Steel company and
a $20,000 packing house.
Contracts have been let for the Belle
Fourche railroad, between that place
and Miles City.
The Minneapolis Tribune credits Mon
tana with being the fastest growing
state in the Union and says it needs
two things, "citizens and money-cap
ital to develop its vast resources and
men to take advantage of its oppor
tunities." Conservative legisiation, low
taxes and helpful spirit of co-operation
by public officials toward capital seek
ing investment, will get both men and
money.
SECOND MONTANA
IS COMING HOME
It is announced from Douglas.
Arizona. where the Second Mon
tana regiment is stationed, that
the entire regiment will entrain
for Helena the latter part of
this week. The boys have now
been on the border three months
and have completed a thorough
course on the target range and
many of them will bring home
badges as expert riflemen. Of
the 80,000 guardsmen on the
border it is announced that the
Second Montana stands first in
general efficiency as soldiers,
thus showing that the months of
training have brought results.
Montana will give the boys a
hearty welcome.
GREEK-ALLY PACT
NEARS COMPLETION
Athens, Oct. 3.-Negotiations be
tween Greece and the entente powers
are believed in circles close to King
Constantine to be nearing completion,
and it is even asserted in some quar
ters a military accord has been reach
ed already, but is being kept secret
pending the arrangement of details as
in the case of Roumania.
The refusal of the entente to recog
nize the Kalageropoulos ministry has
been hampering the negotiations and
helping to confuse the situation.
The negotiations of the entente rep
resentatives so far have been direct
with King Constantine and have not
been technically official communica
tions.
WOMEN "ADOPT" SOLDIERS
Winnipeg, Oct. 3.-Women of the
Westminster church of Winnipeg have
"adopted" 200 lonely soldiers, prison
ers of war in Germany. The soldiers
are Winnipeg and Manitoba boys who
have been captured ia the war, and
who have no relatives to send them
food and clothing.
Harvard Men Honored for Bravery.
Camluidge, Mass., Oct. 3.-Twelve
of the thirty-nine members of the
American ambulance service who have
been awarded the Croix de Guerre by
the French government for conspicu
ous bravery since the beginning of
the European war, are 'students of
alumni of Harvard university, accord.
ing to statistics compiled here.
CHIEF BULGARIAN
PORT IS IN PERIL
London, Oct. 3.-The Roumanians
have invaded Bulgaria. On the upper
reaches of the Danube, between the
fortified towns of Rustchuk and Turtu
kal, where the river begins its bend
northeastward, leaving Bulgarian ter
ritory and separating Roumania pro
per from Dobrudja, the troops of Rou
mania have made their way to the
southern bank of the stream.
Just how many men were thrown
across the river is not disclosed in
either the Roumanian or German offi
cial communications, L..t c , strategic
value of the maneuver seemingly is
twofold.
Ninety miles eastward from Turtu
kai, which lies at the western extrem
ity of Southern Dobrudja, is Varna,
Bulgaria's chief seaport on the Black
sea.
If sufficient men have been sent
across the river and are sent along
the Dobrudja-Bulga.rian frontier to
ward Varna, not alone would the sea
port be in danger, but the move would
constitute a serious menace toward
the isolation of the German, Bulgarian
and Turkish forces operating against
the Russians to the north.
Simultaneously with the announce
ment of the crossing of the Danube,
comes a report from Bucharest that a
fresh attack along the entire front in
Dobrudja has resulted in the defeat
of the center and right flanks of the
troops of the Central powers.
In Transylvania the Roumanians on
both sides of the great Kukel river
have advanced against the Teutonic
allies.
Westward, in the vicinity of Orsova
and near Petroseny, however, the Aus
tro-Hungarians have captured posi
tions from the Roumanlans.
The fighting in Galicia, with Tem
berg the stake, has resulted in suc
cesses for the Teutonic allies north
west of the Galician capital and for
the Russians in the southeast.
On the Brody-Slocoff road the Teu
tons recaptured the ground lost last
Saturday, according to both Berlin
and Vienna, and made prisoners 2,306
Russians, while in the Narayuvka and
Zlota Lipa sectors the Russians re
pulsed vicious attacks of the Teutons,
inflicting heavy casualties and captur
ing 1,600 men.
In the Lutsk region of Volhynia,
northwest of Svieniusky, a Russian at
tack was repulsed.
On the front in France the Germans
at Eaucourt L'Abbaye in fierce fight
ing regained a footing in some of the
buildings of that town, but west of
Gueudecourt and east of Courcelette
the British improved their positions.
On the part of the line held by the
French the men of General Foch made
progress east of Bouchavesnes and re
pulsed an attack south of the Somme
in the region of Vermandovillers.

AMERICANS TO
OFFICER ROAD
New York, Oct. 3.-In an announce
ment giving the details of the contract
for the construction by the Siema
Carey Railroad and Canal company of
St. Paul, of a railroad for the Chinese
government, the American Interna
tional corporation, which is financing
the project, says that the government
Tias agreed to the appointment of an
American chief engineer for the sur
veying and construction of the lines.
and that later he will act as chief en
gineer of the railroad.
Other Officials From U. S.
The Chinese government also has
agreed to the appointment of Ameri
cans to the positions of auditor and
a traffic manager.
There will be built 1,500 miles of
road between points to be agreed upon
after investigation, and pains will be
taken, the corporation says, "to avoid
interfering with any agreements cov
ering railway construction which have
been entered into by the Chinese gov
ernment with the various foreign gov
ernments or financial groups."
The American engineer is to be ap
pointed soon and proceed to China im
mediately. Probably a year will elapse
before the lines are located, it is said.
Preliminary contracts have been
signed by the same Interests, it was
announced, for dredging the Grand
canal in China.
COUN1RY DISTRICTS MADE
GOATS FOR CITY OF MISSOULA
This communication is to remind the
people of the reservation of the neces
sity for activity on their part if the
proposition to issue bonds for the build
ing and equipping of an addition to the
high school building in Missoula is to
be defeated. Under the law it is pos
sible for the district in which the coun
ty seat happens to be located to ex
ploit all the rest of the county provided
the voters permit themselves to be ex
ploited thus. The county high school
board is bringing about the submission
of the proposition of the issue of $75,
000 bonds at the forthcoming election,
The facts briefly are as follows:
The county high school, which is
located at Missoula, while open to pu
pils from any part of the county, as
are the high schools of Dist. 28, actu
ally serves the children of Dist. 1 and
of the adjacent country within riding
distance of the city almost exclusively.
Other high schools of the county hav
Ing a very large percentage of non
resident pupils are denied the benefits
of special privelege which the powerful
district at the county seat can enjoy.
The present high school building is no
longer adequate for housing the pupils
in attendance, as they should be cared
for. When such is the situation in any
other district of the county, that dist
rict, wholly at its own expense, must
provide the needed building and equip
ment. In the case of the Missoula dis
trict, however, thru a technicality of
the law, the burden may be shifted to
include all the districts of the county
even tho they must bear their own
burdens unaided and are required' to
erect their own plants unassisted.
Many of the people of Missoula re
alize that Missoula should have enough
self respect to own and operate its own
high school and that the unification of
the two systems in Missoula will ulti
mately be advantageous both educa
tionally and financially. But as long
as expediency permits the city of Mis
soula to fall back upon the county to
provide institutions for their local use,
so long will the city defer facing the
issue for itself. If the proposition of
the bond issue for the purpose named
should be submitted to the people of
the several districts for ratification, it
is my firm belief that every district ex
cept the district of Missoula would
turn it down, almost unanimously. But
if the people of Missoula desire to con
tinue their Germany-Belgian policy and
to seek only to bring home the pork,
they have the voting strength and can
carry the proposition unless all of the
men and women of the country
take the pains to vote against it. If
you have friends elsewhere in the coun
ty please get in touch with them about
the situation and ask them to vote in
harmony with justice and fair dealing
and the interests of the country com
munities which have been shamefully
penalized thru the working of the state
laws in the past.
In fairness to the city board it should
be known that they appear willing to
begin the unification of the Massoula
educational systems by gradually pro
viding room and supervidion for the
high school of Missoula, but the city
majority of the Missoula county high
school board refuse to fall in with this
plan.
Furthermore let me suggest that be
fore we people of the country communi
ties vote for a candidate for the legis
lature we ascertain whether he is de
sirous of raising Montana out of its
present disgraceful status as one of the
five or six states of the Union which
provide no state aid for rural schools
and rather penalize than assist rural
education in general, as compared to
city education.

DETAILS OF BiG LOAN
DISCLOSED BY ROSE
Washington, Oct. 3.-Details of the
proposed new American $60,000,000
loan for railroad construction in
China, twice the size of any previous
similar loan and arraigned with a
view to increasing the republic's total
railroad mileage by 50 per cent, were
disclosed in details here by David S
Rose, counsel for the American inter.
ests after the publication of dispatches
from Peking indicating conclusion of
the agreement,
Under the agreement, Mr. Rose, who
is former mayor of Milwaukee, said
the Sieiis-Carey company of St. Pau;
contracts to construct as soon as pos
sible with money furnished by the
American International corporation
1,500 miles of railroad through tie
richest section of China, and obtains
an optional contract to build another
1,500 miles later.
Estimating the cost per mile at %40
000, the Seims-Carey contract calls for
an expenditure of %60,000,000, with the
possibility of doubling that amount if
the option is taken up.

FORMER DIXON MAN
FOULLY MURDERED
Hon. A. C. Thomas, formerly
a resident of Dixon and quite ex
tensively known in this valley,
but for the past two years, a re
sident of Thompson Falls, was
murdered in cold blood in front
of the Ward hotel in Thompson
Falls last Thursday morning,
Miss Colby of Spokane being the
murderess.
Mr. Thomas was the chairman
of the republican county central
committee of Sanders county
and in consequence of his posi
tion was active in the political
campaign now on. In Sanders
county a fierce factional fight
had developed, the leaders of
one faction recently starting a
newspaper to assist them in their
fight. Miss Colby was employed
on this paper and together with
her employers had made many
attacks on Mr. Thomas. On the
day prior to the murder Miss
Colby had, according to reports,
sought out Mr. Thomas and ask
ed him for news items. This
Mr. Thomas refused to do, stat
ing to her that she had previous
ly lied about him and his friends.
The next morning as he emerged
from the hotel with a friend
Miss Colby accosted him and de
manded an apology for the alleg
ed insult. Mr. Thomas is said
to have ignored her and continu
ed his way up the street. He
had only proceeded a few feet,
however, when the enraged wo
man drew a revolver from her
wraps and fired four shots in
rapid succession, three of which
took effect. Two bullets pene
trated the right arm and one
penetrated the abdomen,
The wounded man was taken=
to the hospital in Missoula on the
first train but he was beyond the
aid of physicians and died Fri
day morning at five o'clock. Mr.
Thomas was conscious for sever
al hours after the shooting and
stated that the only insult he
had offered the woman, if it may
be considered an insult, was that
she had lied about him and his
friends.
Miss Colby was immediately
arrested and confined in the
Sanders county jail to await her
hearing which was to commence
yesterday. Editor Menire of
the paper on which the woman
worked was also arrested and
there is talk of other arrests to
follow. Talk of the woman's
insanity has already been started
and on these grounds and the
further fact that she is a woman
her attorneys will undoubtedly
depend for favorable action by
the court and jury.
Funeral services for the de
ceased were held in Thompson
Falls Sunday under the auspices
of the Masonic lodge at that
place and the Knights Templar
of Missoula. Mrs. Thomas, wife
of the murdered man, is pros
trated and was unable to attend
the funeral.
Mr. Thomas was born in Mass
achussetts in 1865 and came to
Billings, Montana, in 1892. After
a short time there he settled in
Sunshine, Wyoming, where he
engaged in the mercantile and
ranching business. Later he
moved his store to Meteetse and
upon the organization of Big
Horn county he was elected re
presentative and four years later
state senator. The writer lived
neighbors to him and his estim
able wife for fifteen years and
has known him intimately since
1893. He was always an active,
public spirited citizen, courteous,
a splendid neighbor and a good
friend. To his heart-broken
widow we extend,, with his and
her friends in Montana and Wy
oming, sincere and heartfelt
sympathy. Besides the sorrow
ing wife, Mr. Thomas leaves one
son and two daughters, two
brothers and one sister, and a
host of friends to mourn his un
timely and sad death.
Miss Minnie Hanson, the
trained nurse who took care of
Mrs. E. H. Rathbone for a week,
returned to her, home in Mis
soula Thursday. Mrs. , Rath
bone is feeling much better and
soon hopes to be out again.
