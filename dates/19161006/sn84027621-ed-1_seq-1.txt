LEADERS IN THE AMERICAN
. . : '.. . LEAGUE .
New York, Oct. 6. Th j following
roster of the leading players of the
Boston American League team, in
cludes the principal features of their
playing career from the time they en
tered the national sport: '
William F. Carrigan, the manager
of the team, was born at Lewiston,
Me., Oct. 22, 1883, and came to the
Red Sox from Holy Cross college in
1907. Later he was sent to the Tor
onto club of the Eastern League for
further development and in 1908 he
returned to the Boston club and has
remained with that team since. Late
in July, 1913, he became manager in
which capacity he has acted for the
three years. Carrigan is one of the
very few playing managers of the
present day. As a catcher he has
taken part in more than thirty games
this year and has an excellent batting
and fielding average.
John J. Barry, who was born in
Meridan, Conn., in 1887, graduated
from Holy Cros3 college where he be-j
came a prominent factor in collegiate
baseball and was signed by the Phil
adelphia Athletics after his. gradua
tion. He was one of Mack's main-
fctays from 1908 to, 1914 when the
Philadelphia manager broke up hi3
wonderful team and Barry went to
Boston. He was the regular second
baseman for the Red Sox, a timely
hitter and a player possessed of all
around ability but injuries Which he
received during the present season
have prevented Jiim from playing for
nvmc time pa3t and he may not take
part in the coming series.
Forrest Cady, first string catcher of
the Red Sox, is the tallest man on the
team. He was born at Bishop, 111.,
twenty-five years ago and made his
professional debut with Indianapolis
in 1908. He was sold by Indianapolis
in 1910 to Newark and was with that
t team for two years, being sold to Bos
ton in 1912, when that club won the
world's championship from the Giants.
George Foster, born in . Bokoshe,
Okla., twenty-seven years ago, is a
right-handed pitcher. Most of his ex
perience has been gained with the Red
Sox, as he started his career in the
Texas League with Houston in 1912,
and went to Boston in 1913. Foster,
with Wood absent, was, the mainstay
of the Red Sox last year, and promises
to continue in that role for some time,
because her is a willing worker and
possesses the skill and good judgment
to go with it.
Dell C. Gainor, who substituted at
the initial sack for Hoblitzel, and hit
the ball more than any infielder on the
club the latter part of the season, is
2it years old. le began his career in
IDOO with the Fort Wayne club of the
Central League. He was purchased
from Fort Wayne by Detroit in 1910,
but was not seasoned enough. He re
turned to Fort Wayne, but was recall
ed in 1911. He immediately won the
first bag on the Tiger team and played
through the. season of 1911. He broke
hia wrist in 1912 and was out of the
game so long Detroit sold him to Bos
ton. He was a utility infielder and
pinch hitter for the club last season
and has been of great value to the
" team. , -
Charles Wagner, utility infielder of
the' Red -Sox, probably is the oldest
man in point of service on the Boston
club. He was born in New York, Sep
tember 23, 1881, where he played
semi-prof essionally 'for several years
before being tried out by the Giants
as a shortstop in 1901. He reached
his right form in 1906, attracted the
Red Sox owners and was purchased by
, that club. , .' ;
Lawrence Gardner, third baseman,
is a graduate of the University of
Vermont, where he first learned his
basebalL He was born at Enosburg
Falls, Vt. May 23, 1886, of English
parents.. From 1905 to 1907 he was
f-tar of the Vermont team. Many clubs
frfered Gardner a contract, and he
practically chose the Red Sox himself,
signing in 1908. He farmed out to
Lynn of the New England League, in
1C -03, returning to the Red Sox the fol
lowing season. Since then he has
flayed continuously, excepting when
injured, at first in utility roles,' then

His first professional contract was
with Clarksburg, W, Va., in 1907. He
joined -the Newark League club in
1908, but was sent to Wheeling, from
where hj was" purchased by the Cin
cinnati Reds. Until 1914. he played
with the Red3 and for most of that
time he ranked among the best as a
first baseman. He was sold to Boston
by Herzog, for private reasons, and
immediately made Ms mark with the
Red Sox. He is a big fellow who
knows the game well, can hit and field
with, the best, and is a main factor in
the great machine. ,
Harry B. Hooper, right fielder for
the Red Sox started his career as a
pitcher, but was placed in the outfield
because of his hitting ability. He was
born in Santa Clara, Cal., August 2
1887, and his first professional en
gagement was with Sacramento, Cal.,

City in 1912 and recalled the next sea
son He is a flashy fielder and timely
hitter, and can play any of the infield
positions.

paw of the Boston team, and probably
the most - efficient lef t-handef' in the
league, was born at Fresno, Cal., 24
years ago. He received his early base
ball training at St. Mary's College, in
San Francisco. He came direct to the
Red Sox from the college ranks in
1911, but was sent to Denver for sea
soning. , He was with Denver in 1912

Red Sox in the middle of the 1913
season. In 1914 Leonard led the
American League pitchers 'in efficien
cy. " '

Carl" Mays, another member of the
Boston pitching staff was born in
Portland, Ore., twenty-three years
ago. He came to the Red Sox last
year from the Providence club of the
International League. He is a right
hander and, although a youngster, has
convinced Carrigan and others that he
is the coming sensation of the league.

in Baltimore and first attracted, atten
tion as a; pitcher for St. Mary's In
dustrial school of that city. He Was
taken under the wing cf "Jack? Dunn,
then manager of the Orioles, who ob

Ocala Iron Works Has Been "Working
Its Force Overtime for About
Two Weeks
For about two weeks the Ocala Iron
Works has been working night and
day. According to C. E. Simmons,
general manager, the business of the
works has picked up considerably. The
pick-up started about a month ago,
and may be taken as being in , line
with what seems to be a general im
provement in business over the state.
On Tuesday of this week the Ocala
Iron Works shipped a carload of ma
chinery for the new plant of the Flor
ida Fruit Products company at Haines
City, The Florida Fruit Products
company manufactures 'the grapefruit
juice which was placed on the market
for the first time laV season. ; The
company is building a new and much
larger plant. , A large number of
crushers and screens for road work in
various parts of the state .are being
built at the iron works. ' ,
This time last year the works em
ployed about 20 men. This number
has now been increased to 35 or 40,
and Mr. Simmons says that he is now
preparing to give employment to
about a half dozen more men. Th
plant under normal conditions, .i with
the phosphate plant in operation,' em
ploys from 90 to 100 men, working
during the day only.
PIERS FOR WATER TOWER
Work on Foundations Begun a Week
Ago Will be Completed ,
Today
The six concrete piers which com
prise the foundations for the water
tower of the new water plant will be
completed today. Work on them was
started a week ago. Two weeks will
be allowed for the concrete to set, and
work of constructing the -water tower
will then" commence. Work on the
brick work of the new plant has been
delayed because of a lack of brick.
Two cars are looked for today. 1
Work has already started on the
settling basin for the new well at the
water works. The basin was author
ized by council at its meeting Tues
day night; The basin is a small one,
used for clearing the water pumped
from the well.
Mr. David Henney, engineer for the
city, left yesterday afternoon for New

FIRST PERMIT GRANTED
Work of Connecting with the New
Sewerage System Has
Started
The first permit for a house connec
tion with the new " sewerage system
has been issued to Joseph Anderson,
plumber, for connecting the residence
owned by Mrs. O. T. Green, 60 East
Ocklawaha avenue, and occupied by
Mr. W. P. Preer, general manager of
the Marion Hardware , company. A
permit for connecting the plumbing of
the Empire Cafe with the sewers has
not been issued yet, although council
authorized the work at its last, meet
ing. The second permit for connection
has been granted to Paul Durand,
plumber, for connecting the plumbing
of the residence of Mr. Lanier Robert
son, 211 East Washington street.
Plumbing Inspector Min shall expects
to grant' from 25 to 30 permits this
month. . To begin with there will
probably be no compulsion about con
necting with the sewer mains. Mr.
Minshall .believes that for some time
there will be a large number who will
ask for permits. It will take a num
ber of years, in Mr. Minshall's opinion,
to, make all the connections in the
city required by the plumbing ordi
nance. E " '
McGraw tried t him out in 1912, but
Shore, when released from the New
York baseball club to Indianapolis, re
fused to carry out the plan. The next
