LAUGHING LACENAIRE.
On December 14. 1834, a gentleman
of distinguished appearance walked
briskly along a quiet street near the
Chopinette barrier, in Paris.
This pedestrian, who looked distin
guished even under the handicap of
threadbare garments, was about thirty
five years old. He was rather small of
stature, but carried himself proudly.
His face was refined and intellectual
the face of a poet and a dreamer. In
deed, at that hour all Paris was wvhis
tling and singing one of his songs,
"The Fife and the Drum." He had the
hands and hair of an artist, and the
joyous carefree laugh of a boy. It
was a good thing to hear Lacenaire
laugh.
Behind Lacenaire there walked a
man of vulgar aplearance. His name
was Avril. lie was quite young, not
more than twenty-two, and he had
been so unfortunate as a criminal that
Lacenaire was sorry for him, and was
determined to give him a chance to do
better work.
Presently they stopped before a
dwelling of prosperous appearance.
"This is the place," said Lacenaire.
"Do you remember my Instructions
quite clearly? Yes? Then allons vite!"

4-.:
"He Threw His Arm Around Chardon's Neck and Garroted Him."
The poet rang the doorbell, and the
door was opened by a young man.
"Ah, my dear Chardon," cried Lace
naire. "w'e have come to see your moth
er on a trifle of business-the mere
signing of a paper."
"We are greatly honored. M. Lace
naire." replied Chardon. "Mother, as
you know, is an invalid, and Is in her
bed, but she can do what you ask."
They stood face to face, Chardon
and Lacenaire, and the latter gossiped
gayly of one thing and another, while
Avril stole quietly behind Chardon,
and, having stationed himself prop
erly, at a w ink from the poet he threw
his arm around Chardon's neck and
garroted him. Lacenaire drew a dag
ger then, and stabbed the victim sev
eral times, to make the job complete,
then he went to the room of the in
valid mother and slew her with the
weapon that killed the son.
"There should be 10,000 francs here
somewhere, according to my informa
tion," said Lacenaire. "Lock the door.
my friend, and we'll search till we find
the money."
Avril locked the door, and they
searched and searched, but all they
found was 500 francs. Lacenaire,
whose sense of humor was abnormally
developed, laughed until the tears
rolled down his cheeks. It was this
insensibility, displayed on many tragic
amd harrowing occasions, that made
him one of the most Smous criminals
of modern times.
"Is the joke on us or on the Char
dons?" he asked, as he wiped the joy
ous tears from his face. He wanted
to get away. Those dead people were
getting on his nerves So they left
the house, and went to an inn, where,
over sundry bottles of cheap wine.
Lacenaire planned a larger and better
crime.
He rented an office and painted an
assumed name on the door, thus cre
ating the impression that he was a
business man. Then, by laying his
plans carefully, he arranged that a
bank messenger should call upo him
In his office on a certain day, the abo
sen day being one on which collections
were sure to be large. It took a great
deal of skillful maneuvering to bring
this about, but the details are not es.
sential to this story.
Everything being in readiness. Avril
was so foolish as to be arrested, while
trying to rescue a lady friend frtom the
police. So, at the eleventh hour, Lace
naire had to go forth and seek another
assistant. Reliable help of that kind
is hard to find when most needed, but
I after much trouble the poet accepted
as his partner a gentleman named
Franucols, to whom homicide was a fad.
It was said of him, in his own haunts,
that he would kill a man for a sou,
which was cheap enough, to be sure.
I- rancois, however, should have
knon Itter than to eat oranges be
1re c('onllliitting a crime. Or, if he
couldn't get along without oranges, he
shou!d have realized that It was bad
to drop the peel on the floor of a busi
nltes mana's otlice.
At the appointed hour the bank
nmesseliger arrived at the office with
his little bag fairly bulging with
money, and securities. Lacenaire, the
smiling, the fascinating, asked him to
seat himself at the table and examine
certain papers. The messenger did so,
and while the poet engaged him In
conversation, and held his whole atten
tion, Francois camne up behind. dag
ger in hand, to stab him to the heart.
Francois, who had studied murder un
der the old masters, knew how, to
reach the heart from any angle or po
sition. This looked like an easy and
sure job! But, maledictions on the
orange peel! His foot slipped just as
he delivered the blow. The messenger
was stabbed, but not mortally, or even
seriously. With a yell of terror he
leaped for the door and reached it
first, and ran down the stairs yelllng
murder. Francois also sped away,
and Laeenairv followed close at the
messenger's heels, also y..!ling murder.
thus diverting suspicion until he
reached the street and was lost in the
crowd.
lie felt that Paris was no place for
him just then, so he departed for the
provinces, where for a long time lie
lived opulently. lie wrote much poetry
at this time, and it was good poetry.
I which 'sold readily; but he was too
wise to depend upon the muse for a
living, so, when not emlallming things
Sin song lie devoted his genius to for
gery, and with great success. When
t he returned to Paris he was attired in
purple and fine linen, and was a credit
to the boulevards.
a Manwhile Francois had been. ar
rested on some trifling charge, and
Avril still was in jail. The crimes in
which they had been concerned were
complete mysteries to the police, and
it seemed that they would always re
main so, when Francois dropped a few
words which made the police suspi
cious, and they drew from him the story
of the attack upon the bank messen
ger. Avril's conscience became active
about the same time, and he told of
the Chardon murders. So it came to
pass that the poet was arrested, and
when he learned that the discovery
was due to his accomplices, he made
full confession, his only object, he said,
being to take the betrayers to the
guillotine with him.
The trial was a famous one. The
most celebrated people of France
crowded to the courtroom to see the
laughing Lacenalre, who was dressed
like a prince. He laughed and joked
throughout the proceedings, and drove
Avril and Francois to a frenzy time
and time again by his ridicule. UpQn
'everal occasions the guards had to
hold them. they were so anxious to
get at his throat.
Francois was sentenced to life im
prisonment, and Lacenaire and Avril
to death. So one day in 1835 these
two made their last appearance in
public. Avril died first. and met his
fate with brutish calmness. Lacenaire
tried to appear jnunty and joyous, but
it was with an effort. He was excited
and nervous. Being a man of imagina
tion, a poet and artist, death meant
more to him than to an ordinary crimi
nal. lie fought for self-control with
a mental courage that is more heroic
than any physical courage. Badly
scared, he tried to seem undaunted.
But it was his fate to undergo an ex
traordinary ordeal that would break
down any courage. The guillotine
wouldn't work. Time and again the
ax descended to within an inch or tw
of his neck and then stuck, and the
executioner fumbled with it, raised it,
and let it fall again. The tortured
man twisted himself around so that he
could look upward, and uttered an
awful, agonized shriek that was never
forgotten by those who heard it.
But the shriek was eat in two. The
ax worked at last.

of land through foretgn terri

great Planamla cana;tl. Uncle
Sara quite naturally felt that, as the
work neared comtapletlti, there also
shouhll be  :a eapittl city frotm w\hilh the
strip could I be :zLve'rnt d and the tca'll:l

Balboa is the permanent tiown t Ithe
southern r (end of the canatil. is the seat
of governmelllllnt, the reidence of tilhe
governor Iland the helhlunll:rtrs ,of ca
nal constrctiot n and rllulltagetnllt llt. In
short. it is to the Canal Zone, what
WaV-.uhingt:.on is to the United tates.
I:tlhoi, Wais namnledl ill honor of Vasco
Nunez de Ilalltta, who, "silent, upon
a peak in D:lrien." first saw the dis
tant waters of the Pacific ocean and
thus Ibeircai"e known to history as its
discoverer, writes II. II. Updegraff, in
the St. Louis Republic.
The town of Jfalboa is: not the first
village that Uncle Sanm has built along
the route of the canal. It probably
will he the last, however. But, unlike
these others, which were no more than
wooden construction camps. Balboa Is
permanent in character. It is to last
as long is the canal, which, indeed, is
as long as time itself. There is an
ather difl'ere.we l. tween this new
town, this capital of the ('anal Zone.
and the otler canal villages, and that
is that much more money has been
and is being spent to make It the most
attractive place of residence on the
entire Isthmus. In fact, it is Uncle
Sam's model town.
An American Community.
Notwithstanding its wholly unamer
can name. Balboa is a thoroughly
American community. Its inhabitants
are all American, for it was built with
the Intention of giving the American
canal workers and operatives an ideal
spot In which to have their homes, in
which to rear their children under
proper American surroundings, and
where it would be possible to have a
wholesome A.\erican atmosphere. The
only foreigners who are part of the life
i In Balboa are the West Indian negro
servants, nmost of whom, however, live
elsewhere.
W\hile Balboa is wholly American, it
is yet quite unlike any American city
or town of its size "hack home" in the
states. It has absolutely no political
atmosphere. It is difficult to conceive
an American town, no matter how
small, that has no mayor, no city coun
cil, no political boss and hence no
politics. Balboa has none of these.
The Canal Zone is prohibiton terri
tory and, therefore, Balboa has not a
single saloon within its limits. In this
respect it also is different from a ma
Jority of the cities and towns "hack
home." The "poor man's club" is
wholly unknown, not only because
there are no poor men on the Canal
Zone, but also because they are pro
hibited. The occasional tippler must
either maintain his own private little
bar in his own home or journey to the
neighboring city of Panama. where the
"cantinas" are both numerous and
well stocked and where everything is
wide open and the bars never close.
In p|lae of the "poor man's club"
of the cities "hack home" there is the
spacious building of thel Young Men's
Christian association which fills all the
needs of club for the men. meeting
place for the women's societies and
playhouse fcr the children. A separate,
as well as general, roomll or rooms is
reserved for each. Not far away is
the 25-acre athletic field which is now
under construction with a lavishness
and detail such as no politically self
governed city in the United States can
boast of. It was all done without ex
pense to the population for there are
no taxes to be paid In this model town
of Uncle Saun's.
Site Was Once a Swamp.
The site of Balboa, between Ancon
and Sosa hills, originally was a swamp
which was tilled mn. It was chosen be
cause of Its proximity to the huge ma
chine shops and other canal activities
at the southern end of the waterway.
It also was chosen because it would
be near the capital city, Panama, of
the Republic of Panama and would,
therefore, place the two capitals Into
quick communication. This was neces
ary because of the varied interela
tionshlp between the two countries due
to the bauilding and operation of the
Panama canal.
Only a small portion, however, is
built on the former swamp and this
is made up of what might be termed
the civic center. On Ancon hill, be
hind the handsome new administration
building. is really the best and pret
tiest section. Here are the oflicial resi
den(crs clustered about the governor's
holuse around which the social life of
tihe comnlllllllity in time to coime will re
volve'. Across the former swamp to
ward the west in Sosa hill on which
many of the new concrete two and
four-family houses have been built. At
the foot of Sosa hill and facing the ad
ministration building are the huge Y.
M. C. A.. the new commissary and its
companion refrigerating plant.
When the town was planned it was
the intention to so construct the build
ings that all would harmonize in archi
tecture. This has been carried out
with so rigid a resolve that perhaps
the uniformity in a measure spoils the
effect of the whole. There Is noth
ing along the Prado, for instance, to re
lieve the eye of the sameness of the
eight concrete houses that face the
central parkway. They are all alike,
in design, in size and Interior furnish
ing. They were cast in the same con
crete mold. There is a stilted formal
ity about them that jars, but which
undoubtedly prevents the jealousy
which would be aroused were there a
possibility of choice.
Balboa Heights Attractive.
The town of Balboa is virtually di
vided into four sections. East of the
new administration building, which
naturally dominates the business life
of the town, on the sloping side of An
con hill. is the official residence quar
ter. This section is frequently referred
to as Balboa Heights. It is here that
the real beauty of the village is to be
seen. In time, no doubt when nature
has completed its work, the other sec
tions will equal and, perhaps, surpass
it in attractiveness. Its present ad
vantages are due to having been
planned and constructed first and its
natural advantages regarding location.
South of Balboa Heights is another
flat hilltop which.has in recent months
become known as Quarry Heights. or
sometimes MllWary Heights. The lat
ter is used because It is the site of
the large and handsome home of the
commanding general of the United
States troops and his staff officers.
Farther south still is the permanent
camp of the provost guard or military
police.
At the foot of the hill on which the
new administration building stands,
and also near the bottom.of the hill
on which is the governor's house, which
overlooks the tract, there is a large fiat
bottom land that, too, formerly was a
huge swamp. It comprises about 1,000
acres and was filled in by the spoil
from the dredges excavating the inner
harbor of Balboa. The salt water has
killed all the vegetation, which, how
ever, was neither plentiful nor valu
able. A top dressing of rich soil will
eventually be given this tract af then
it will grow anything. When insy is
available it is planned to tra orm
this bottom land into a large, hand
some park.
Between Ancon hill and Sosa hill Is
Balboa Flats, so called from the fact
that it was built on the only level part
of the new town. A part of the fiats,
however, is on the slope of Sosa hill
and overlooks the Prado and fiats
proper from the west. The central fea
ture of the flats is the 'Prado, which
forms a wide double roadway down
the center. On it are the commissary,
the Y. MI. C. A., the dispensary, fire
and police stations and the high school.
Also there are eight four-family houses.
A large part of the fiats is to be util
ized for the magnificent new athletic
field now under construction.
Why Orchestras Tune Up.
"Why," asked a visitor to the the.
ater the other day, "do members of
the orchestra always worry people
possessing nerves, like myself, by tun
ing up their instrumentsa"
It Is all a matter of thermometer,
according to a msiclian. The tem
peratare in different parts of the
building is different and the instru
- ments have to be tuned in which they
- are played. As a rule, the air in a
Stheater becomes warmer as the pse
formance progresses and so the n
struments have to be tuned eeral
