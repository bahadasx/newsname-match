REPLIES TO WILSON'S DEFEASE
Democratic Party's Fiscal Policy, Its
Tariff Act and Its Foreign Policy
Not to the Liking of the Former
President, Who Opens the New Jer
sey Republican Campaign Synopsis
of His Speech.
Trenton, N. J., Oct C William H.
Toft, former president of the United
States, delhered the opening address
of tho Republican state campaign hero
last night lie spoke to a large audi
ence.
Mr. Taft asalled tho Democratic
party's fiscal policy, its alleged ex
travagance, Its "free trade" tariff, Its
claim to credit for prosperity and Its
foreign policy, and he made a direct
renlv tn Pl-pMrfpnf- Wllunn'e Infnncn
of his course in settling tho threat
ened railroad strike through the en
actment of the Adamson law He de
clared that the campaign of ID! 6 Is as
Important as tho campaign ot 189G. and
resembles that campaign In that th&
Democratic party and its candlda'e
are seeking a vote of power for disin
genuous, unsound, but alluring reason
Discussing the passage of the Adam
son act Mj. Taft said: "Unwise sub
serviency to tho demands of leaders
of organized labor finds its crowning
Instance In President Wilson's
dealing with the threatened railway
strike. Under tho duress of the threat
the president of tho United State
and congress of the United States suc
cumbed. It was one of the greatest
national humiliations to which tho
people of this country have eve been
eubjected.
"The Issue of this controversy Is
not whether the men wcro entitled to
more pay than they received. Tha
glaring evil In the result Is that by
threatening public disaster, a group of
men have succeeded In compelling an
abject surrender of the president and
congress of the principle of arbitra
tion to a peremptory demand for a
compliance with their wishes, without
an Investigation or a hearing of a
most Important issue.
"Mr. Wilson's defense ot his action.
makes his case worse than If he had i
eald nothing. It Is palpably dlslngenu- j
ous and confirms the Just inference (
tnat wnai movea mm cnieny in ue
matter was to secure votes, and that
tho real Interests of the country had
but little weight
Referring to Mexico, Mr. Taft said:
"Mr. Wilson's action In Mexico should
defeat him for the presidency. And
sow Mr. Hughes Is asked what he
would have done. Ho certainly would
cot have done what Mr. Wilson did,
Had the Republican administration
been continued, Huerta would have
been recognized, but with only twelve
days before the coming In of a new
administration, It would have been en
tirely Improper and Inconsiderate for
the mitsoing administration to com
mit the incoming to any policy on the
subject. More than this, delay In rec
ognizing Huerta would have secured a
settlement of troublesome Mexican
questions."
