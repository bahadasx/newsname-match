GERMANS CRITICIZE RU8S.
Charge Czar's Officers With Firing On
Own Men to Make Theit» Fight.
Berlin, Oct. 6.—Casualties among the
Russian army this year on the eastern
front, according to cautious calcula
tionsv says the Overseas News Agency,
have been at least 1,250,000 officers and
men.
According to conservative Danish cal
culations. this news agency adds, Rus
sia, during the flrftt two years of the
war, Jost considerably more than 6,
000,000 men. Wounded men who re
turned to the front are not included in
this estimate. The agency says:
"The prophecy of David Lloyd
George, the British secretary of War,
that Russia will fight to the death Is
how about to be realized. The losses in
recent fighting have been enormous.
"Russian artillery fires indiscrimin
ately among troopa in order to push
them forward and shoots down troops
whiclTare retreating. In the battle of
Korynitza, which was victorious for the
Germans, Russian columns were driven
forward by a curtain of flre and whips.
Dead bodies formed in mountains.
After the losses sustained by the Rus
sian Emperor Guards on the Stokhod
river and in the sanguinary engage
ments at Pustomyty and Korytnitza,
nothing remained of the Emperor
Guards."

forger}' in their alleged copy, of his tele
gram and he submits as proof of his
statement that the Western Union's tel
egraph blank photographed by the
Harding crowd waa not In existence
until three years after the alleged date
of. telegram. He then publishes an
authorized Interview from former Sen-
Hunter, in whiiqh Hunter says, that
tie aid not receiver the telegram alleged
ft have been photographed and that he
understood Mr. Kelly's position to have
been exactly opposite to that shown In
the telegram reproduced, and then
Kelly reprints an editorial from his
newspaper published four days after
the date of the alleged telegram in
which he censures the legislature for
defeating the five-mile limit bill.
Proof Convincing.
The proof of forgery is quite convinc
ing. The Hai-ding'crowd had sent out
what was presented as a photographic
copy of a telegram addressed to Hon.
Robert Hunter, March 30, 1011, and
signed by John C, Kelly. The telegraph
blank with all the telegraph company's
memoranda was reproduced. It seemed
to be an exact photograph of a tele
gram, Western Union blank and
xall.
The blank showed the names of the
telegraph company's officers, among
whom was that of "Newcomb Carlton,
president." Kelly then shows in his
newspaper that this blank never came
into use by the Western Union until
1914, when Newcomb Carltpn became
president, therefore the telegram hel#
before the camera by the
1
Harding
crowd had b^en written on a telegraph
blank which was not in existence in
1911. The telegraph blank In use by
the Western Union in 1911, when the
alleged Kelly telegram is represented to
have been sent, contained the name of
"Theo. N. Vail, president" Vail was
president of the Western Union until
April, 1914, when he was succeeded by
Carlton.
Kelly charges that somebody In
Harding's Interest has forged this tel
egram in order to make a photographic
copy.
The Harding crowd Is using their al
leged telegram as a counter Irritant to
the photographic reproductions of
Harding's letter to Del
C.
Huntoon, po­
litical agent for the salobns, and the
photographic reproduction qf the letter
from the Iowa Liquor Dealers' Associa
tion boosting for Harding however,
these photographic reproductions have
never yet been denied. Their allegeft
copy Sicily telegram is new broad

Chanoeilor Retains Support
Waterford, Ireland, Oct. 8.—In a no
table address to his conetluents here
today, John Redmond, the Irish na
tionalist leader in parliament, declared
that In spite of the recent Irish rebel
lion home rule for Ireland is safe, If
Ireland remains sane. Mr. Redmond
also declared that conscription could
never be forced upon Ireland, adding:
"I can not bring myself to believe
that, malign tho the influences at work
are, the government will be Insane
enough to challenge a conflict with
Ireland on this subject. Conscription
for Ireland, far from helping Jreland
and the war, would be the most fatal
thing that could happen.
"It would be resisted In every village
In Ireland. Its attempted enforcement
would be scandal whloh would ring
around the world. It would procure
no additional men."
Recruiting Is Not uma.
Continuing, Mr. Redmond said:
"The mere threat 1s paralysing re
cruiting, which, mark y9u, le not dead,
as some people say. The latest fig
ure, Indeed, show that from the date
of the rising (Easter Sunday) until
September, 6,000 recruits were re
ceived.
"This demand for conscription Is not
a genuine military demand. It is a
base politkial device put for vard by
men who want
Xo
injure and discredit
Ireland's political future."
SUPPORT GERMAN CHANCELLOR.
Reichstag Not Likely to Approve Re
sumption of Submarine Campaign.
Berlin, Oct. 8.—Efforts to compose
the differences between Chancellor von
Bethmann-Hollweg and his opponents
apparently have accomplished little.
The chancellor's position, however, ap
pears unshaken and such Information
as 4s obtainable Indicated that resump
tion of the ftibmarljic campaign on the
old basis has met. with no success.
After conferences between thr cab*
inet and members of the relchstag
discussion of the submarine issue was
resumed today before the ways and
means committee.
Herr von Jagow, secretary for for
eign affairs, and Admiral yon Capelle,
secretary for the navy, made state
ments explaining the position of the
government The naval secretary fre
quently Interposed In the debate which
followed. The following probably may
be taken as a failTly accurate statement
of the situation.
In Accord With von Hindenburg.
The conferences thus far have not
brought the opposing elements much
nearer together. They have shown the
chancellor to be in full accord with
Field 'Marshal von Hindenburg, the
chief of staff, and the navy depart
ment. The naval department has sup
ported the chancellor in his purpose to
restrict the submarine campaign.
No new arguments were introduced.
The alignment ,of the relchstag parties
on the question has undergone llttlo
change since the struggle of last
spring. Part of the Catholic center, It
Is true, has beenjshown to be amenable
to arguments of the opposition, but Dr.
Peter Spavin and other centrist leaders
are still supporting Dr. von Bethinann
Hollweg. Mr. Spahn, In a speech, de
fended strongly the position of the
chancellor.
Chancellor to Retain Support.
Even in the unlikely contingency
that some of the centrists disregard
the unit rule and vote. against the
chancellor, should the test come, this
defection would be counterbalanced by
the group headed by Deputy Schiffer
and "Red Prince" Schoenlch-Oarolath,
which Is out of sympathy with the In
trigue against the ohancellor.
Even the conservative camp is not
united. The free conservative wing
under Baron Zedlltz, has declared it
self out of sympathy with the move

very little chance that the subfharine
