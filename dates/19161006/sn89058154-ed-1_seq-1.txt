I s v Be a Regular Man
t There are many men in . this
' county who have not paid their
poll taxes, i They are good men,
but careless. This condition
; should not exist. It mzkes no
I matter whether you are a Repub
lican, Democrat, Progressive, or
what not, if you would maintain
your self respect as a part- and
parcel of the government of this
state, v you should exercise that
sovereign right granted you by
your state, and "put yourself in
shape to vote on November 7th,
when not only state officers are
- to be elected, but a President and
Vice-President ' of the United
States.
Be a regular man and get your
poll tax straight. It is worth
the price to feel like a man, and
no male twenty-one years old is a
. man who cannot take his stand
by his fellow man and vote his
convictions in a free and untram
eled country. . ; . ,
Get right NOW. ;
Pay your Poll Tax TODAY.'
- ; The Memphis Fair :
We took in Friday and Saturday
the, greatly advertised vTri-State Fair
at the Bluff City. A fair is much like
a circus, once seen all seen. We in
, 1 1856 attended the state fair at St.
jLouia, whoii the Prince of, Wales was
present There was no Prince of
. Wales or any other personage bigger
than a Governor, and the big horse
races, cattle, hogs and. chickens did
' not look as big to us as when, a boy
, In 1850,' But we suppose they have
been improved. , To say the least, it
is claimed the' cattle there were worth
a million; but if we had a million the
cattle would not change owners. The
side shows are about as attractive as
the big arena show,' though we only
attended, three or four. The agricul
tural county exhibits were very at
tractive, though Ed Bondy brought us
Wadnesday. a (bigger pumpkin than
' those we saw. v ; I " ,
The night exercises were interest
ing, closing with vfirowprka.'; The at
tendance Saturday and at night
"seemed to flit every place one wanted
to be at. The best of order obtained,
pnd not-a harJword or- drop of the
joyful did we discern. The lid ia
, really on and ' fast i!) -Memphis
just now.. Fifty,, years, have made
great changes, in : Memphis; bub ? few
of the old landmarks can be' seen.
There are not many scores who now
inhabit the city further back than the
Editor of the Independent. '
Hon. L M. Rhodes' Letter of
i ';',. Acceptance .
Gentlemen of the Committee: ::,
, The nomination which has been
tendered pie comes without my solici
tation, as you well know. I declined
to enter the race for the nomination
and published my declination. I , had
-preferred to continue the work that
I was doing in the advancement of
the agricultural class. I am not a
politician and politics has its features
which have never appealed to me.
However, 1 have for years made pub
lic questions my earnest study. . It is
with a feeling of regret that I 'turn
aside from the work I have been do
ing for years and which I have loved
in spite of its hardships. I fully re-
, alize that national legislation . has
been under control of interest other
than those of the producing class,
and while Ninety percent of the peo
ple of the district are rural popula
tion and Eighty percent are, farmers,
the district has not been represented
by a farmer in Fifty years. So far
as what has happened this district is
concerned other than a few Post
Offices wqjiardly know that we have
had a representative in congress.
It the people in this district think
. that I should widen the scope of my
activities, and change my Geld of labor
from that in which I have been work
ing for Nine years in Tennessee and
other state?, I will give the task my
very best efforts; and will render the
best service I am capable of giving to
all the people. I have never in all
my life tried to array one class
. against another and that is against
my nature. My position is known,
and my life is an open book to the
people who know me. I come before
the people as a candidate for con
gress on the record of what I have
done as a private citizen. Few men
who have offered themselves as a can
didate . for congress the first time
have given the people, the same, op
portunity to know their fitness for
the position that I have done,. .
With no thought of, ever, entering
the political arena I took up the fight
for economic reform and better meth
ods and business, with . the farmers.
So far there is not a 'promise that I
have ever made that I have not ful
filled or a duty imposed that . I have
not carried out to the letter. I shall
carry the same sense of obligation
into whatever field of endeavor that
I may enter and be ever ready to
answer the ; call of the people , to
serve them to the best of my. ability.
With sincere appreciation for this
evidence of the confidence of the peo
ple of the district, I accept, this
trust, and shall as nearly as possible
make a thorough canvass of , the . dis
trict. . ' - ' ,
Very truly Yours,
L. M.' Rhodes.'

HOW APPENDICITIS ,
CAN BE PREVENTED
.Selmer pcopk fhould know that &
few doses of simple buckthorn bark,
glycerine, etc., as mixed in Adler-i-ka,
often relieve or prevent appendicitis.
This simple mixture removes such
surprising foul matter that ONE
SPOONFUL relieves almost - ANY
CASE constipation, sour stomach or
gas. A short treatment helps chronic
stomach trouble. Adler-i-ka has
easiest and. most thorough action of
anything we ever sold. Browder
