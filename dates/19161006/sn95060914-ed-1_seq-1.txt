TVENTY SECOND YEAH
COUNTY m
BIG AUTO ROAD RACE
From Douglas to Phoenix
Will Be Run
- Her 13th
Now that Iho big Douglas
Phoenix Road Race to be run on
November 13th is assured plans
are going forward rapidly to
make this the biggest event of
its kind ever held in the South
west and from early indications
it promises not only to loutclass
all previous road races held in
this State but in the number of
entries and time of running it is
expected that it will excel the
famous Los Angeles to Phoenix
Desert Classic
Secretary Shaughnessy of the
State Fair Commission states
that his office is literally flooded
with inquiries regarding the race
and requests for entry blanks
and conditions With hardly an
exception the desire is expressed
to enter the track races tobe held
on the fair grounds November
18th To date he has been as
sured of one car from Yuma
three cars from Tucson one from
Bisbee three from Douglas two
from Globe one from Clifton
one from Miami one from Lords
burg New Mexiqo one from
Derriing New Mexico and four
from Phoenix
The fact that this race is limited
to cars from Arizona New Mex
ico and Texas only eliminates
the possibility of having to com
pete with the big specially con
structed racing cars driven by
professional drivers and will give
the local men an equal chance
for the money
TRe present plans call for the
race to start from Douglas at an
Learly hour in the morning the
possibility of a checking station
in Tucson and a finish on the
fair grounds before the grand
stand the same afternoon
Secretary T D Shaughnessy
states that he will be glad to fur
nish any one with further infor
mation concerning these events
and a printed copy of conditions
and entry blanks can be had by
addressingJijira yi care of Hie
State Fair
Much of the enthusiasm de
veloped in the road race so far
is due to the efforts of Dick Hol 1
lingsworth representative of the
Chancellor Lyon Company
automobile accessory supply
house Los Angeles who is mak
ing a tbur of the State in the in
terests of the road race and track
meeting at this years State Fair
Mr Hollingsworth is the official

handled by information in the
