Nevada-Utah
ill Is Doing Fine
Operations have been going ahead
almost uninterruptedly at the Con
solidated Nevada-Utah mill during
the past two weeks; the actual run
ning time being about 95 per cent.
The mill is receiving its entire feed
from the mine, where two shifts are
working, and the ore going to the
mill is carrying a higher percentage
of silver than heretofore; which, as
a consequence, shows a higher grade
mill product.
The Amalgamated company ship
ped during the week a car load of
crude zinc ore, sorted in passing to
the mill, which assayed 44 per cent
zinc and carrying very gratifying val
ues in 'silver.
The Pioche Pacific railroad has
been operating fewer trains to Jack
Rabbit lately owing to the decrease
in the tonnage coming from the Bris
tol mines. .

SUGGESTION'S HOW
TO PRESERVE MEATS
STATE POLICE MAKE
ARRESTS AT GARDNERVILLE
E. Curtis, a member of the state
police, appeared in Gardnerville last
Thursday with orders to clean up
the town of undesirable citizens and
ntop illegal gambling which compos
ed of poker games where the dealers
were raking in percentage. The of
ficer found! it necessary to make
about three arrests, the balance of
the fifteen or more gamblers hitting
the trail when told to do so by Cur
tis. '
Besides this element, several
roughnecks, who have been suspic
ioned of selling whiskey to Indians,
were moved to a more inviting and
less dangerous clime.
It Is reported that several of the
gamblers announced, after being
given orders to move along, that as
soon as things uletad down the
would return. However, strict watch
is to be kept and their return will be
met with even more strenuous oppo
sition than was extended to them on
the present occasion.
One of the gamblers was allowed
to return to Gardnerville Wednesday
to settle with a man with whom he
had intrusted a sum of money but
who later refused to turn it over to
him.
The movement of cleaning up the
town has the backing of all right
thinking citiens and all are glad
that the strong arm of the law has
reached out and removed a stigma
that was fast ruining the good name
of the town. The united effort of all
will henceforth present a repetition
t)f conditions as they existed here
this summer. Gardnerville Courier

SUBJECT OF ANALYSIS
IS PROSPECTOR'S BURRO
EXEMPT FROM EXECUTION?
The protest of the prospector, who
wants his auto classed in the same
category with a burro is reprinted
from a local paper, which is worth
reprinting. It is signed "A Pros
pector." "While in Goldfleld recently I got
wind of an action brought in the
justice court wherein the defendant's
automobile was attached. Judgment
had been entered against the defend
ant but no execution had been is
sued up to that time.
"It appears that the defendant In
the action was a prospector. That
phase of it is only material to me in
that if he were a prospector, I would
Jike to gel something off my chest
through the medium of your valua
ble paper, .
"Back in the '60's sometime a law
was enacted and placed on the stat
utes exempting from sale under exe
cution certain properties belonging
to a judgment debtor, among which
was specified a prospector's tool. and
outfit, including his only means of
transportation, the faithful burro. I
Investigations to determine what
sections of the state contain under
ground water that is injurious or
beneficial to vegetation and agricul
tural development are being carried
on in Nevaaa at tne present nine
under the direction of the United
States geological survey. This work
Is being done by G. A. Waring and
0. F. Meizner of the geological sur
vey. It is considered of great 1m
portance to future agricultural de
velopment in Nevada because it cov
ers in its scope every undeveloped
section of the state
The men have under their charge
a party of surveyors and they plan
to visit every county in the state
within the next three or four years,
which Is the time that it is estimat
ed it will take to conclude the re
search work.
Waring and Meizner are working
in conjunction with the state univer
sity. They take samples of under
ground water and send their samples
to the pure food department of the
university where analyses are made
by Prof. S. C. Dinsmore, head of that
department. The samples are taken
from different depths depending on
tho condition of the soil and the wat
er shod from which the water comes
The primal object of the investiga
tion is to determine whether or not
the water is fit for irrigation purpos
es or for domestic use, and the quan
tity available from any particular
source.
The engineers are now in the
Reese river valley, Lander county.
Thev have covered the Dig Smoky
I valley, .which is located in Lander
and Nye counties and have done
some work in Clark county. A large
number of samples have been sent to
the pure food and drug laboratory
and analyses will be made as rapidly
as possible by Prof. Dinsmore.
The research work will also in
clude an analysis of water from ev
ery hot spring in the state. Prof.
Dinsmore says that numerous inquir
ies have been received concerning an
alytical content of different hot
springs. There are about 2Q0 such
springs in the state. They will be
tested for medicinal possibilities and
also to determine whether or not the
water should command a market val

Curing meats with brine is a good
method for farm use. It Is less
trouble to pack the meat In a barrel
and pour brine over it than to go
over it i.iroe or four times anl r ib in
salt, as in the dry-curing method.
The brine also protects the meat
from insects and other vermin.
Brine made of pure water and ac
cording to the directions in the fol
lowing recipes should keep a reason
able length of time. During warm
weather, however, brine should be
watched closely, and If It becomes
ropy," like sirup, it should be boil
ed or a new brine made. - A cool,
moist cellar Is the best place for
brine curing.
Curing Ageu?s Named
Pure water, salt, sugar or molas
ses, and saltpeter are all the ingredi
ents needed for the ordinary curing
of meat.
The meat may be packed in large
earthen jars or a clean hardwood
barrel.
The barrel or jar may be used re
peatedly unless meat has spoiled In
it. It should be scalded thoroughly
however, each time before fresh meat
is packed.
Curing should begin as soon as the
meat Is cooled and while it is still
fresh.
Ordinarily 24 to 36 hours after
slaughter are sufficient for cooling.
- Frozen meat should not be salted.
as the frost prevents proper penetra
tion of the salt and uneven curing re
sults.
Corned beef. The pieces common
ly used for corning are the plate,
rump, cross ribs, and brisket, or, In
other words, the cheaper cuts of
meat. The loin, ribs, and other
fancy cuts are more often used fresh.
The pieces for corning should be cut
into convenient-sized joints, say, five
or six inches square. It should be
the aim to cut them all about the
same thickness so that they will
make an even layer in the barrel.
Fat Meat Best
' Meat from fat animals makes
choicer corned beef than from poor
animal.-i When the meat la cooed
thoroughly it should be corned w.
soon as possible, as any deoay in tho
meat is likely to spoil th.t brine dar
ing the tuning process. Under no
circumstances should the meat !ie
brined while it is frozen.
Weigh out the meat and allow
eight pounds of salt to each 100
pounds; sprinkle a layer of salt one
quarter of an inch in deptli over the
bottom of the barrel; pack in as
closely as possible the cuts of meat,
making a layer five or six inches in
thickness; then put on a layer of
salt, following that with anothar
layer of meat; repeat until the meat
and said have all been packed in the
barrel, care being used to reserve
salt enough for a good layer over the
top.
After the package has stood over
night add, for every 100 pounds of
meat, four pounds of sugar, and four
ounces of saltpeter dissolved in a
gallon of tepid water.
Three gallons more of water
should be sufficient to cover thit
quantity. In case more Or less than
100 pounds of meat is to be cornel,
make the brine in the proportion
given.
A loose board cover, weights 1
down with a heavy stone or pieco of
1-on, should.be put on the meat to
Veep all of it under the brine. In
cr.se any should project, rust would
start and the bri vj would spoil In u
t.hort ime.
Don't Boil Brine
It is not necessary to boil the biin?
except in warm v. father.
If the meat ha been corned dur-ii.p-
the winter and must be kep-. Into
the summer season, it would be wi-ll
o watch the brine closely daiins
the spring, as It Is more likely to

Conpe
r
spoil at that time than at any other
season.
If the brine appears to be ropy or
does not drip freely from the finger
when immersed and lifted it should
be turned off and new brine added
after carefully washing the meat.
The sugar or molasses in the brine
has a tendency to ferment, and, un
less tho brine Is kept in a cool place,
there is sometimes trouble from that
source.
Th.e meat should be kept in the
brine 2S to 40 days to secure thor
ough corning.
Beef Can 15e Dried
Dried beef. The round commonly
is used for dried beef, the inside of
the thigh being considered the choic
est piece, as it is slightly more tender
than the outside of the round. The
round should be cut lengthwise of
the grain of the meat in preparing
for dried beef, so that the muscle
libers may be cut crosswise hen the
dried beef is sliced for tat. Is use.
A tight jar or cask is i.ecessary
for curing. The process is as fol
lows; To each 100 pounds of mo.it weigh
out five pounds of salt, three pounds
of granulated sugar, and two ounces
of sultpeter; mix thoroughly togeth
er. Rub the meat on all surf-tcea
with a third of the mixture and pa.k
it in the jar as tightlyas possible.
Allow it to remain three days,
when it should be removed and rub
bed again with another third of the
mixture. In repacking, put at the
bottom the pieces that were on top
the first time.
Keep Track of Time
Lt stand for three days, when
they should be removed and rubbed
with the remaining third of the mix
ture and allowed to stand for three
days more.
The meat is then ready to be re
moved from thp pickle.
The liquid forming in the jars
should not be removed, but the meat
should be repacked in the liquid each
time.
After being removed from the
pickle the meat should be smoked
and hung in a dry attic or near the
kitchen fire where the water will
evaporate from it.
It may be used at any time after
smoking,- although the longer it
hangs in the dry atmosphere the
drier it will g"et. The drier the cli
mate, in general, the more easily
meats can be dried. In arid regions
good dried meat can be made by ex
posing It fresh to the air, with pro
tection from flies.
Salting Pork
Plain salt pork. Rub each piece
of meat with fine common salt and
pack closely in a barrel. Let stand
overnight.
The next day weigh out 10 pounds
of salt and two ounces of saltpeter
to each 100 pounds of meat and dis
solve in four gallons of boiling wat
er. Pour this brine over the meat
when cold, cover and weight down to
keep under the brine.
Meat will pack the best if cut into
pieces about six inches square. The
pork should be kept in the brine till
used.
Art of Sugar Curing
Sugar cured hams and bacon.
When the meat is cooled, rub each
piece with salt and allow it to drain
overnight. Then pack It in a barrel
with the hams and shoulders in the
bottom, using the strips of bacon to
fill in between or put on top.
Weigh out for each 100 pounds of
meat eight pounds of salt, two
pounds of brown sugar, and two
ounces of saltpeter.
Dissolve all In four gallons of wat
er, and cover the meat with the
brine. For summer use It will be
safest to boil the brine before using.
It that case it should be cooled
thoroughly before It is used. For
winter curing it is not necessary to
boil the brine.
Bacon strips should remain in this
brine four to six weeks; hams six
to eight weeks. This is a standard
recipe and has given the best of sat
isfaction. Hams and bacon cured in
the spring will keep right through
the summer after they are smoked
The meat will be sweet and palatable
if smoked properly, and the flavor
will be good.
NEW DAIRY HERD FOR

GOVERNMENT TO PROSECUTE
VIOLATORS OE GAME HW
The federal government has been
apprised of the wholesale slaughter
of ducks in this vicinity since Sept.
15 by hunters who have no regard
for the game laws, or for the propa
gation of the young birds, and steps
will be immediately taken Jo prose
cute some enterprising hunters in
this vicinity who took the law in
their own hands and went out, re
gardless of repeated warnings in this
paper. '
Recently, a bunch of game hogs
went out with their trusty guns and
much ammunition, and killed 78
young ducklings who were hardly
out of the nest. Their names are
known, and all the information that
s necessary has been forwarded to
Washington with the expectation
that the federal authorities will take
the matter In hand and make an ex
ample of such butchers.
The California-Nevada Game "Pro
tection association has taken the
matter in hand, and will prosecute
each and every violation of the fed
eral law, which says that ducks must
not be shot before Oct. 1 even though
the Nevada State law reads that
same may be shot on or after Sept. '
15.
Hunters should remember that
federal laws supercede any state law j
ever made, and that the federal law .
will stand as constitutional In the
highest courts of the land. They are

Supt. J. II. Sampson of the Uvada
Copper company, while in the city a
few days ago on his way to Salt Lake,
declared that the physical conditions
at the Bristol properties of this com
pany were never quite so good since
he has been in charge. In fact, he
says, the mine is in condition to keep
the tramway going at capacity for
more than a year with the present
ore In sight. .
The company was obliged recently
to let up shipment's of ore owing to
having carried out its contract with
the smelters; but the management
is anticipating that another contract
will have been signed before many
days and that the normal output
will be resumed.
Manager Johnson was at the mine
early In the week and was greatly
pleased with the showing being made
by Mr. Sampson at the Uvada.
PIOCHE HUNTERS SLAY
DUCKS IX WHITE RIVER
A crowd of local sportsmen left
last Saturday for White river to be
present at the opening of the duck
season. They found plenty of the
fethered tribe over in that region and
succeeded in bringing down about
140 in a day's shooting. In the party
were W. H. Pitts, W. M. Christian,
E. Kahn, W. L. Powell, F. C. Getsch,
Alex Lloyd, Roy Orr and L. H. Bea
son. Mr. Pitts had a boat built for
the trip, which was carried to the
hunting ground by a trailer built by
Mr. Orr. Both came into fine play,
first In gathering up the ducks which
fell Into the water, and lastly In
bringing them home..., , -
The hunters encountered some
"beastly" weather on the way home; ,
having faced a heavy rain storm all
the way from the hunting ground to
Pioche. There were a number of
hunters in White river from Ely on
the opening day.
