iDING IN THE
PUBLIC SCHOOL
Heading in the public schools
of this county to my mind is the
most important, and yet the most
neglected of all the subjects in
the coriculum.
It has been said that every
thing we read becomes a part of
us. This is undoubtedly true in
the case of pupils in the grades,
or in the stage of develoDment.
Hence how important that they
read, but read such things as
will supply memory's storehouse
with the best literature, at a
time when it is most likely to he
retained.
In after years these same selec
tions will hold far greater in
teres' for the reader, because
they have been previously read,

then constitute the finishing
course in the study of these
classics, and wi'l bring out the
finer shades of meaning, and hid
den Idealities prviouslv un
discovered. The reading in "The
Old School" .laced a greaur
emphasis on expressional read
ing, but from my observation I
think we need to place more em
phasis on thought getting, but
while we place emphasis pri
marily on interpreting the selec
tion for the reader himself, the
formalities necessary to give the
full force of the selection to the
hearer must not be overlooked.
The technique of reading though
always subordinate and second
ary to the mastery of the thought
nevertheless claims constant and
careful attention. The art of
good reading can only be culti
vated by judicious training, and
the PUBLIC school should spare
no pains to realize this result.
We should be veay careful in our
selection of reading matter and
select such and only such as is
the best in poetry and prose in
the literature of the English
speaking race. Such as shall be
' the means of cultivating in our
pupils a taste for good reading,
and at the same time shall have
that refining influence on charac-
k ter which good literature always
has. Without a doubt the read
ing accepted in the public schools
is seriously deficient in these
particulars.
The problem then that con
fronts the teacher is the adapta
tion of the reading matter, or
the selection, to tne development

period of the pupil as he stands
on the threshold of adolescence,
the time of rapidly forming
ideals, and the extreme suscepti
bility to suggestion "As a man
reads so will he think; as he
thinks, so will he live.1" The cry
is going out from our high
schools.and-colleges "Teach them
how to read." Contrast the
man of high culture with the
man of no culture. The intellect
of the uncultured man is con
fined to his five senses. It takes
in nothing but the dull images
around him, all else is a complete
void. His soul is tied to the
present, and that small spot of
the earth's surface on which he
moves in his daily rounds. Up
on the other hand take the cul
tured inan. When he opens a

to bygone time?, or his mind
may grasp grand idr.as: his heart
imbibe glowing sentiments; un
til he finds himself dilated, re
fined, inspired a greater and
nobler being I am quite sure,
to a great extent, we read oir -selves
into the style of language
we use, into the forms of thought
we entertai". and into the sort
of lives we live. Then reading
not only informs, but also forms
the mind. The greatest intel
lectual training afforded by read
ing is the training of the imagi
nation. Because poets and story
tellers live in the imagination.
We must train our mental eye
sightWe must see the scene,
enter into the thought and feel
ing of the story or poem which
we read.
Without this power of mental
vision we can never read well,
because we can never understand
well, so if we would travel into
the realms of poet? y and fiction
we must take that exhilarating
guide, the imigination.
But our reading matter in
school should give information
as well as acquaintance with the
best literature.
I am quite sure that the sub
ject matter should not only cover
literature, but also Agriculture,
Geography. History. Biography,
Sciences, Industry and Ethics.
Now the question arises where
can I find the reading matter so
necessary to be used in my
school? I will answer this ques
tion I believe perfectly satis
factory to any honost inquiring

there are many way, by having

to say that any teacher in the
county can raise this amount and
get these books this year if their
desire is great enough. And the
mere pleasure derive 1 from their
