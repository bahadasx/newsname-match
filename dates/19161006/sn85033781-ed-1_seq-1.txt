being arranged.
The republicans of Van Huron coun
v Ivivp n in t treat in store. The
VJ " wm o
innual banuuet has been talked of for j
some time, and now begins to take
tangible form. Tuesday evening,
October 17th, is the date and Hart
ford tho place. Complete plans are
not available at this writing, but the
preliminary arrangements are well in
hand. The banquet this year will be
under the auspices of the newly or
ganized Van Huron county republican
club, and the County committee
jointly. Roscoe W. Hroughton has
the unique distinction of being presi
dent of the club, and chairman of the
county committee, so that the two or
ganizations can work in perfect har
mony for the success of the meeting.
i
It is not definitely known as yet who
all the speakers will be.
men Patrick H. Kelley
Congress-
and K. L.
Hamilton are sure to be on the pro
gram and probably Arthur H. Van
denberg of Grand Rapids will be
another. An effort is being made
through National Committeeman
Charles B. Warren of Detroit to se
cure the Hon. Governor Willis of Ohio
as the big "Gun" of the meeting. It
is hoped that Governor Willis can be
secured, for he is recognized as one
of the greatest campaign orators of
the day. If however, he should not
be available some other speaker of
National reputation will take his
place.
This will be the biggest meeting of
the campaign. Tickets will soon be
on sale, and it is up to every republic
an in Van Huren county to make plans
to attend this banquet and rally.
Every indication points to a great re
publican victory at the polls this year,
not only in Michigan but throughout
the nation. Those who have the
affair in charge for the 17th, inst, are
working hard to make this a banner
meeting and a red letter event for re
publicanism in Van Huren county. It
is up to every member of the party in
the county to assist not only with
their presence, but in every way
possible.
MRS. LOUISE SHAFFER.
Louise Egelus was born in Preston,
Canada ,on December 23rd, 1843. She
came to Paw Paw with her parents
at the age of twelve years, and resid
ed there until she was seventeen.
They then removed to Ann Arbor,
where in 1861 she was married to
Siegfried Shaefer. They went to live
in Clinton, Michigan, where her hus
band was in business, and remained
there four years; then came back to
Paw Paw, making their home in the
village until 1880, and afterward upon
the farm where they lived until the
death of Mr. Shaefer, about thirteen
yuan ago, since which time she has
lived with her daughter, Mrs. Hail,
in Lawton.
She has been in failing health lor
several years, and after several weeks paw paw hag been well represented
of suffering, she passed away on the. th h()Ut tm? week and a iargc

She also leaves nine grand children

A true friend, a loving sister, a de
voted mother and a good christian
woman has gone to her reward.
Funeral services were held at the
home of her daughter on Thursday,
September 28th, conducted by Rev.
P. A. Shape of Paw Paw.
O. M. C. A. starts in with
25 charter members
and occupy "Cham
ber of Horrors"
A new social organization is occupy
.
the "Chamber of Horrors" in the
National Hank building under
the post oflice. This "Chamber" was
Judge Killefer's justice court for
years. It has later been occupied as
a barber shop and cigar store. The
new club started in with twenty-live
charter members, and the following
officers :-Preiidflt C. W Reynolds;
secretary,
Charles N. Hathaway;
treasurer, Barney 0 Dell The name
chosen for the organization is The O.
M. C. A. and the motto selected, "As
we journey through life, let us live
by the way." The club furniture is
of a non-descript character, being
donated by the members. It is as a
rule of antiquated design, and in a
dilapidated state of repair. The
tables range from the round green
top with slot in the middle kind of
former years, to a sewing table which
some member evidently "swiped"
from his wile's sewing room. They
vary in heigth and "previous condition
of servitude." It is usole.-s to at
tempt to describe the chairs, as space
ind descriptive powers would not per-
iuit. A committee is laboring on a
constitution and by-laws which will
undoubtedly cover all the points need
ed in this unique organization.
SKIP SOME CERTIFIED GRAPES
There will not be' many cars of
.. .
Certified drapes shipped lrom Paw i
Taw this year, for the reason that the
fruit does not come up to the stand-1
ard, and further that the growers
have not learned yet how to put up a
package that will pass the inspection
Eventually however, all growers will
come to it. "The Wolverine" shipped
a carload of certified grapes to St.
lmis last week and another car of
uncertified fruit to trfV same party
The certified fruit brought twenty
cents per eight pound basket and the
others eighteen cents. Several other
cars of certified grapes will go out
this week.

Willis. Never was a betty campaign
speech made in Michigan.
The genial "Pat" Kelley seems to
gain in popularity as the years go by.
He was given a great ovation when
called to the platform for one of his
characteristic speeches. "Pat" is
some "Spell Hinder" too.
Senator Townsend was present and
asked to address the convention. He
made a splendid speech but does not
appear to be in good health. His
friends could not help but notice his
changed appearance. The strenuous
days in the Senate, and sickness in
his home have told on him during the.
past two years.
National Committeeman Charles H.
Warren made the trip from New xork
city to be present at this convention.
Michigan never had a more capable
and efficient committeeman. He spent
his bovhood davs in Van Huren county
