Joseph Stock Arrested for As
sault in Colorado.
He Believed Runaway Mrs.
Stock Was Demented.
HAD ROPE AND HANDCUFFS
Wife Says Husband Was After
Her 200-Acre Farm.
These Are All Allegations of
Colorado Springs Police.

Springs officials on the charge of as
sault. And according to the Colorado
Springs Gazette. Mrs. Stock charges

in an asylum in order to get posses
sion of a 200-acre farm belonging to
her.
Incidentally. Mra. Stock who was
placed in jail upon Stock's telegraphic
request, is now free and Stock is in
jail.
Mi. Stock came to Topeka during
the state fair, driving a horse in from
the home, four miles north of To
peka. She tied the horse in front of
a North Topeka store and disappeared.
She had $1U with her at the time. For
two weeks a search was made for her
but not a trace was found. Her hua
l.iind told the sheriff of Shawnee coun
ty he believed she was mentally de
ranged when she left and asked lor
UMfiKtance in locating her. .
Through a Maryville, lo., banker it
was learned she was in Colorado
Springs. Sl'.e wrote to the 'junker and
asked him to loan her $100 with a
;uu-aere farm near Maryville as secur
itv. Following up this tip the sheriffs
.ffice telegraphed to the sheriff of
l-:i Paso county. Colorado, instructing
him to arrest and hold Mrs. Stock.
When word casie that she had been
arrested and was being detained, Mr.
Stock left for Colorado Springs.
Tried to Kidnap Her.
T "Since 'tneiTTinW-today, nothing had
been heard from Mr. Stock. Relatives
have been telephoning in to the
Fherlff's office asking why he did not
return with Mrs. Stock. The Colorado
Springs papr says Stock tried to kid
nap his wife when he reached that
citv.
After three days' observation in the
county juil Mrs. Stock was released.
Later she met Mr. Stock and a quar
rel ensued. He insisted that she re
turn home with him and she was just
as determined that she would not.
Finally the two become so noisy that
the police were caned. vv nen tney
arrived the Topeka couple were not to
be found. Later Stock was arrested
at a hotel.
He was taken to the station and a
vharge of assault placed against him.
During the search of his effects the
police found ten feet I of quarter-inch
lope, a pair of handcuffs and a ticket
for a stateroom on the Rock Island
from Colorado Springs to Topeka.
According to the Colorado Springs
police, it was Stock's intention to
handcuff his wife, place her in the
stateroom and tie her securely until
he leached Topeka.
Mrs. Stock is quoted as saying it
was the intention of her husband to
return her to Topeka, have her tried
before a lunacy commission and com
mitted to an insane asylum, and then
to secure the title to a 200-acre farm
which she owns. This, she said, was
the original cause of her leaving To
peka. SESSIONS IN ANSWER!
lei::oerats Trying to Befuddle Voters
Says State Chairman.
Attempts of the state Democrats to
befuddle the minds of the people by
raising other issues will meet with no
murcet-s, according tj Charles H. Ses
sions), chairman of the Republican
central committee. The people of
Kansas. Mr. Sessions believes, still
want two paramount questions an
swered by the Democrats of Kansas.
"They want to know why the Demo
crats sidetracked woman suffrage,"
;aid Mr. Sessions, "and also why the
prohibition plank was voted down at
th Democrat party council.
"These are two propositions of vital
interest to the woman of Kansas. The
Democrats can't evade answering
them by bringing up other things to
befuddle the minds of the people."

KEEP UP WAR 3 YEARS
Holland Notified Any I'eace Move

Rome, Oct. 6. The allies have in
formed the Dutch government that
any move toward peace on the part of
Holland would be construed as a pro
German act, it was learned today.
(This is the first hint that Holland
has been feeling out peace sentiment
among the European belligerents.)
Exactly when this information was
sent to The Hague is not known here.
The fact that such action was taken
was disclosed in discussion of the
Lloyd George interview warning neu
trals not to intervene at this time.
Well informed circles here say that
the allies are reconciled to the proba
bility that the war will last at least
three years more.

say something about "his friend, Jere

Trial on Proposed Highway

RAILROADS WERE ONCE BUILT
"Why Cannot Counties Issue
Bonds for Roads Jfow?
Congressman Anthony Speaks
Before Wakarusa Boosters.
Convicts at the federal prison at
Leavenworth will be the first to aid
in making the Fort Leavenworth
terminus of the Fort Leavenworth
Fort Riley military road a reality, ac
cording to a statement made today by
Congressman D. R. Anthony, jr., in a
speech delivered to the good roads
boosters at Wakarusa. Topeka, Shaw
nee county and other counties lying
in the district that would be benefited
by a hard surface road between Fort
Leavenworth and Fort Riley should
not be contented with the convict
work which will be slow and will
start at the Fort Leavenworth end of
the highway, the First district con
gressman stated.
"The funds- allotted to the state of
Kansas under the recent federal good
roads act should be urged by the bene
fited counties for use in building this
road," said Mr. Anthony. "And, fur
ther, the action of State Engineer
Gearhart in giving this idea his ap
proval will unquestionably be indorsed
by the people of Kansas."
Orders Mope Guards.
Mr. Anthony told of an eight-year
fight made in Washington for the
realization of his dream to build a
highway between the biggest infantry
fort in the United States and the big
gest cavalry fort in the country.
And now it begins to take on a
realistic tinge," said Mr. Anthony.
'The department of justice has onlv
this month increased the number of
guards at the federal prison at Leav
enworth by ten in order to permit the
working of a force of men in the con
struction of hard surfaced roads at
the east end of the line wbtch will
form th? eastern termtnaFbf the pro
posed Fort Leaven wortlx-Fort Riley
road."
Ttecommewls Bond Issue.
Continuing, Mr. Anthony urged that
concrete construction be used in build-
inf future roads in Kansas and recom
mended a half a million-dollar bond
issue for the construction of concrete
roads in Shawneo county running out
of Topeka.
If any Kansas county embark on
a program of substantial road im
provement there is no middle ground
to take' said Mr. Anthony. "From
my observations and travels in other
states I am convinced that the only
permanent ana practical method of
improving our country roads is the
adoption of a system of concrete con
struction. Every county in eastern
Kansas should have a complete sys
tem of concrete roads radiating from
the principal city or county seat. Such
roads should be constructed of not
less than six inches of the best con
crete on a prepared foundation of not
less than twelve feet in width. They
will cost from $10,000 to $12,000 a
mile but will last a quarter of a cen
tury. . A Reception Tonight.
"In early days many Kansas coun
ties bonded themselves heavily for the
construction of branch railroads-, some
of them of doubtful value. Todav the
best expenditure that Shawnee county
could make would be a bond issue of
a half million dollars for the construe
tion of a system of concrete roads
running from Topeka to the smaller
towns and communities of the
county.
Mr. Anthony accompanied the coun
ty candidates- to Wakarusa today and
a number of them took off their coats
and loaded dirt and rock on the
wagons. From Wakarusa Mr. Anthony
and tne county candidates1 went to
Berryton, where Mr. Anthony spoke
at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon. A fair
is in progress at Berryton. A recep
tion for Mr. Anthony will be held at
the National hotel tonight. Everyone
is invited.
Still Work on Koad.
The enthusiasm if the good roads
boosters didn't .diminish a whit this
morning and dozens of automobile
load? drove out to the big hill, near
Wakarusa, at 7 o'clock this morning.
A hard day's work faces them to cut
down the hill by nightfall and if the
work isn't completed then the good
roads men will go out again tomorrow
and complete the job. After the hill
is reduced the Topeka avenue road
connecting Topeka with the Santa Fe
trail will be as nearly perfect as a
dirt road can be.

HOME RULE SAFE
Ireland Must Remain Sane,
Says John Redmond.
Conscription Cannot Be Forced,
Nationalist Declares.
Waterford, Ireland, Oct. 6. In a
notable address to his constituents
here this afternoon, John Redmond,
the Irish nationalist leader in parlia
ment, declared that despite the recent
rebellion, "with all its inevitable after
math of brutalities, stupidities and in
flamed passions," home rule for Ire
land is safe "if Ireland remains sane."
Mr. Redmond also declared that
conscription could never be forced
upon Ireland, adding:
"I cannot bring myself to believe
that, malignant though the influences
at work are, the government will" be
insane enough to challenge a conflict
with Ireland on this subject. Con
scription for Ireland, far from helping
the army and the war, would be the
most fatal thing that could happen.
"It would be resisted in every village
in Ireland. Its attempted enforcement
would be a scandal which would ring
round the world. It would produce no
additional men." Continuing, the
Irish parliamentary leader said:
"The mere threat is paralyzing re
cruiting, which, mark you, is not dead
as some people say. The latest figures
indeed show that from the date of the
rising (Easter Sunday) until Septem
ber, six thousand recruits were re
ceived.
"This demand for conscription i:
not a genuine military demand. It is
a base political device put forward by
men wno want to injure and discredit
Ireland s political future.

Captain Tate of the detective bureau.
The girl admitted that she and the
three men companions had motored
from this city and were at Atscion, . .
J., at the time of the shooting. She
admitted she had heard several shots
after the chauffeur of the automobile
had stopped his car not far from the
spot where a number of men said to
have been masked, held up Rider's
car in an attempt to steal the payroll
of $5,000 being taken to the 300 em
ployes at Rider's cranberry bogs.
Giuseppe Russo, an intimate friend
of the de Marco girl, the police say,
Frank Vessal, the chauffeur, and
Frank Lad on a, the three other prison

Philadelphia, Oct. 6. Millie De
Marco, a 1 9-year-old Italian girl, is
believed by the police to have engi
neered the plot which resulted in the
murder -of Henry Rider, wealthy cran
berry grower, near Hair.monton, X.
J., yesterday and the shooting of
Rider's brother and two other per
sons. Millie was an employe of A. J.
Rider, president of the New Jersey
Cranberry Growers association.
She and three other Italians are
under arrest in connection with the
murder, which grew out of an attempt
to hold up the Rider party and rob
them of a bag containing $5,000, the
payroll for the cranberry pickers.
. The De Marco girl and three Italians
arrested in this city late last night
were traced to the Italian colony here

mobile in which eleven men and one
woman were seen in the vicinity of
the home of the Riders yesterday
shortly before the murder.
Three Others Shot.
A. J. Rider and his daughter, Mrs.
Elsie Smathers, who valiantly drove
the automobile after she had been
wounded, and James N. Rigby, who
also occupied the Rider car at the
time of the attack, are in ihe Jeffer
son hospital of this city. Their con
dition today was hopeful, and physi
cians said they would recover.
The sight of eleven men and a one
girl in an automobile aroused unusual
interest among the natives of Atsion,
X.J. Some one casually noted that the
automobile bore a Pennsylvania li
cense number. Detectives learned the
number and the description of the
girl which corresponded with that of
the young woman Rider employed on
his cranberry bogs. The girl knew

LOSS IN U. S. BY
INCENDIARY FIRES
Chicago, Oct. 6. Incendiarism is
costing the property owners of the
United States $200,000,000 annually,

the Fire Underwriters association of

SETTLEMENT OFF
X. Y. Distributors' Offer lias
String to It.
Dairymen Refuse to Accept
Offer for 3Ionth Only.
Xew York, Oct. 6. New York's
milk strike was resumed with un
abated vigor today, following refusal
of the Dairymen's league to accept the
offer of the big dealers to pay the in
creased prices asked for one month
only. Where the situation laie yes
terday was thought to have been near
ing a clearing, issues again today were
tigntly drawn and the outlook became
more serious than ever when the
dairymen declared they would accept
no offer that did not include agree
ment by the dealers to pay the in
creased prices for the next six months.
In the meantime further depletion1
of New York's milk supply seemed
inevitable.
