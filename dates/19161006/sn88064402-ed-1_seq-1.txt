ROTATRY THRESHER
IS BIG SUCCESS
The new rotary separator recently
.invented by Mr. Monroe Davis which
was unloaded here Monday morning
is being tried out on rice this week.
With Mr. Davis are his son S. T.
Davis and Mr. Sales from the factory
at Enid, Oklahoma. They are trying
the machine out with the view of
making any minor alterations that
may be required to adapt it to the
threshing of rice. So far the machine
has operted fully up to the expecta
tions, although it was found neces
sary to increase the capacity of the
grain conveyor. The work is being
done at the Armstrong shop, and as
soon as completed, pijobalqly early
next week, the public will be invited
to witness a practical demonstration.
This new machine promises to revo.
lutionize the rice threshing industry.
It has many features which appeal to
the rice farmer. The cylinder and con
cave, bugbear of all machines now in
use, which in spite of every precau
tion will break a large percentage of
the rice, are omitted in Mr. Davis'
machine, the grain being removed from
the straw by centrifugal force. An.
other feature of the machine, which
will make it popular from the start,
is the low initial cost. It will be sold
for just about one-half the price of
the present machines.
It is the intention of Mr. Davis to
have the machines for rice manufac
tured right here in the rice belt and
from present indications Welsh will
be selected for the location of the fac.
tory.
Mr. Davis will spend the winter
here, stopping at the home of his
brother, Mr. L. T. Davis in North
Welsh. He is very favorably im
pressed with the country, the beauti.
ful fall weather, with flowers still in
bloom having exerted their charm, as
he freely acknowledges.

NECESSITY Ir STILL
THE MOTHER OF INVENTION
Scarcity of cars for the handling of
the heavy grain movement is being
felt by farmers all over the country,
and not less acutely right here in the
heart of the rice belt where the har
vest is just now at its height, but it
cannot be said that the Southern Pa
cific is not doing all in her power
to alleviate the situation.
Two express cars were set out here
Wednesday to be loaded with rice, one
at the Welsh Warehouse and the other
at the Welsh Canal Co.'s warehouse,
where they were promptly loaded for
shipment. This is the first time with.
in our knowledge that express cars
have been used for the handling of
freight shi ments. In speaking of
the pheneomenon, Mayor Gabbeit who
is manager for the Welsh Canal Co.,
and a very reliable gentleman said:
"I expect to be shipping rice in Pull
man cars within a few days."
Mr. R. L. Abbott, local manager
of the Southern Rice Growers, who is
so busy these days that we haven't
the heart to ask for an interview, cas
ually remarked that the association
had sold over 50,000 sacks of rice here
at Welsh this season, and the only
trouble in disposing of the season's
crop seemed to be in the shortage of
cars.

WELSH GARAGE
i INCORPORATED
t Alladin, with his magic lamp,
- worked what in his time were con
r sidered marvelous tranformations,
but today mere man has him skinned
many, many ways in the overnight
realization of far away fancies. The
• little industries of yesterday are the
crossroads shop of the village smithy
is supplanted by great machine shops
and vast garages, until now we have
in a comparatively small community
industries of this class that less than
five years ago would have sufficed in a
city of twenty thousand inhabitants.
Theappearance in this issue of the
Journal, of the charter Welsh Garage
Company, Incorporated, recalls what
has been accomplished in this line here
in Welsh in a very short period of
time. This company which has a
capital stock of $7,500, which may be
increased to $10,000.00 without change
in the articles of incorporation, is of
ficered and the stock is all owned by
local people. Dr. R. R. Arcenaux is
president; I. R. Alyesworth, Vice
president; and C. L. Abell, secretary
treasurer and manager.
Mr. Abell, the manager has been
engaged in the machinery and auto
mobile repair work here in Welsh the
past thirteen years, having been em
ployed at the Armstrong Machine
and Well Works uuntil last March,
when he took over the management
of the Welsh Garage, and it is only
fair to Mr. Abell to say that since his
advent in the garage its business has
grown immensely and expanded to
every branch of the automobile repair
and supply business.
Mr. I. R. Aylesworth, the vice presi
dent, has recently taken an active part
in the shop work, in the supervision of
the electrical and tire repair depart
ments, in which he is a specialist.
At the expiration of the last school
term Mr. Aylesworth went to Chicago,
Ill., where he spent the summer in the
large factories and shpos studyuing
automobile storage battery, starting
and lighting system with a view of
specializing in this one important
branch of the business. A natural
mechanic, his expert services in
Om branches are highly. appreciated
by the patrons of the garage.
Messrs. Abell and Alyesworth are
at present assisted in the able conduct
of the business by Messrs. Webb Har
ris and Polly Fruge, and as the busi
ness increases its present proportions
other employes will be added to the
force.
With fifteen hundred square feet of
floor space, all the modern machinery
and equipment, including steam vul
canizer, air compressor,lathes, drills,
punches, power grinders, etc., and a
large and complete stock of repair
parts, accessories, tires, tubes, etc.,
and expert operatives in every branch,
the Welsh Garage is one of the most
up to date in Southwest Louisiana, an
institution of which we are proud.

Sthe enterprise, Mr. Al G. Barnes

. tion solely by his 'own efforts in
Il nineteen years from a show consist
ing of one trick dog and perform
ie ig monkey. Mr. Barnes is a most
g unassuming gentlemen, but possess
g es those qualities of leadership
,o which have made hinm the successful
t head of an organization representing
il an investment of over half a million
n dollars and the' absolute master of
d every one of the 5l(kanimals in his
troupe.
e Mr. Barnes began his career as an
:t animal trainer over 25 years ago,
. travelling with Barnum, Forepaugh
i. and the other big showmen of that
L5 day as an animal trainor. Then he
Le started by himself in a small way,
with trained dogs, etc., gradually
f including wild animals in his rep.
y ertoire. The first experiment of
i. note was in teaching a lion to ride
, a horse. The incompatability of these
a two animals had hitherto been sup
r posed to render such an act impossi
., but Barnes got away with it and made
I, a tremendous hit in vaudeville for a
t number of years in that way. Then
n he began to enlarge his collection of
animals until it was too large for vau
deville circus, which now numbers 250
"Monarchs of the Jungles, Forest and
Field."
n Until the show teached its present
g proportions Mr. Barnes personally
n trained all his own animals, and today
a is able to work any act in the circus
n with the exception of the sea-lions,
d with whom he has no acquaintance,
Sdelegating that responsbility to his
Sbrother. He has had many thrilling
3 3xperiences, meanwhile, and exhibited
to the News.Stateaman ugly scars on

FIRE DESTROYS
VINTON BLOCK
Fire which started in Dilwon's bak
ery shortly after 9 o'clock Sunday
night destroyed a block of Vinton, and
threatened to leave the entire town in
ashes. As no wind was blowing, vol
unteer fire fighters subdued the flames
before they could spread to the next
block, containing t\o warehouses
packed to the ceiling with rice--4000
sacks-and the services of the Beau
mont and Lake Charles fire depart
ments, who were called on for help,
were not needed.
The Beaumont fire department made
hurried preparations and were on their
way to Vinton when they were flagged
and a message delivered saying their
services were not needed. The Lake
Charles fire department also was stop
ped before it left the city.
Loss Estimated at Over $10,000
According to messages received here
the loss will exceed $10,00 and but
few of the losers carried insurance.
Eight buildings were destroyed. They
were:
The Vir.ton Weekly Booster, Wil
liam Hearn, editor; M. McKeller's
general mechrandise store; Brous
sard's meat market, Dilwon's bakery,
I. O. O. F. hall and three residences.
The fire is said to have started in
the bakery. The furnaces had been
cold since noon, the message contin
ued, and it is not known how the fire
started. It had good headway before
it was discovered and the small chem
ical engine which comprises the Vin
ton fire fightiny apparatus proved in
adequate. The best results seemed to
be obtained by the bucket brigade,
which utilized blankets and sacks also.
Threatened Entire Town.
The flamep leaped rapidly from
building to building and the entire
neighborhood was illuminated as if
the noonday sun had been shining.
Practicallf every mar. in town joined
in the fight against the flames and un
recorded acts of heroisrm were done.
Everybody feared the flames would
spread from the block where the fire
started to the huph warehouses in the
next block it was felt if this hap
pened the entire town was doomed.
The loss that would have resulted
should the warehouses have gone
down can hardly be estimated. Each
of them was packed to the roof iOth
rice and it is thought fully 4000 sacks
were in the two of them.
The houses which were burned will
be rebuilt with little delay, it was an
nounced before the ashes had grown
cold.
The entire community seemed to
deeply appreciate the effort Beau
mont and Lake Charles fire depart
ments made to reach Vinton. Several
telephone calls of tlankt wrere re
ceived in the cities last night.
GIRLS' BASKET BALL TEAM.
The girls of the Welsh High School
have selected the members of their
basket ball team and are practicing
hard preparatory to the defense of

is as follows:

The girls expect to play a matched

be given it can readily be seen that
every contestant who stays in the race
is positively assured of an appreciable
Iyrize. Then, besides the automobile
there are five other valuable prizes, so
the six highest at the finish are as
sured winners. There is plenty of
time yet for any one of the low ones
to come in and win the capital prize.
The contest manager will take pleas.
ure in explaining in detail to you just
how this can be done.
The contest is just now getting
interesting locally, the contestants
seeing where their advantage rapidly
lies. In the start a number of them

the sale of the trade coupons which
gain them an extra 1000 votes for
every dollar.
