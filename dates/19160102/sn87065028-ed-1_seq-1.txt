VICTORY.
Chang Putt Columbui on
Competitive Baaia With Sur
rounding Cities.
The Interstate Commerce Commi
nlon on last Friday approved the gen
eral adjustment of freight rate on
railroads serving the south between
the Mississippi river and the Atlan
tic, and the gulf and the Potomac
river. Thia means that the incoming
freight rates to Columbus will be ma
terially changed, and that this city
will be placed on a competitive basis
with Meridian and other surrounding
trade centers. The change also
means that the local wholesale trade
territory will be widened.
A special sent out from Washing
ton Friday evening said in part:
"A readjustment of freight rates
on railroads serving the south from
Mississippi to the Atlantic and from
the gulf to the Potomac, framed by
a committee of Southern railroad
men at the commission's order to re
duce and eliminate the so-called long
and short haul provisions of the in
terstate commerce act was approved
today by the Interstate Commerce
Commission. ' 1
"The new schedule will reduce
hundreds of rates now quoted higher
to intermediate points than to ter
minal points, and at the same time,
they provide for an increase in many
cases in rates to such terminal points
as Atlanta and Birmingham. "
"The general effect of the ordel
will be to increase rates to and from
important centers, where traffic or
Urinates, or.reacb.es its destination."
la Mayor's Court.
L. C. Sargeant, a young white
man of. this city, was tried befoie
Mayor W. C. Gunter yesterday on

county farm. Sargent was arrested
by Officers Moorehead and Cook.
J. T. Hamner was arrested by Of

charge of soliciting orders for liquor.
He was placed under a $500 bond to

WRECKED BY JOY RIDERS
CAR BELONGING TO T. J. LOCKE,

AND SMASHED.
Unknown joy riders last Friday
night surreptitiously took an auto
mobile belonging to Hon. T. J. Locke
Jr.,a prominent local wholesale gro-
cer.from a garage on the premises of
Mr. Aaron Hahn, a salesman in Mr
Locke's employ, and after having
driven the car a distance of three
miles out Military road, ran the ma
chine into a ditch, and left it there
in a badly torn up condition.
The car was discovered by Mr. Al
len ' Presley, a farmer living about
six miles northeast of Columbus
while en route to this city yesterday
morning, and upon arrival here he
reported the matter to the police. A
search of the records at the city hall
disclosed the fact that the car was
owned by Mr. Locke and that the li
cense had been purchased by Mr.
Hahn, by whom it was used in mak
ing trips to surrounding towns and
country stores. Both gentlemen were London saying the communication

EFFORT TI WIDEN MARKET
CARTER $ENDS SAMPLE BALE
TO BRITISH GUIANA, SOUTH
AFRICA.--
Mr. W. H. Carter, secretary of the
Lowndes County Hay Association,
is at work in an effort to widen the
market for Johnson grass hay.
Recently he learned that British
Guiana, South Africa, was using
quantities of Timothy hay, and they
knew nothing of Johnson grass, so
through the courtesy and co-opera
tion of Mr. Thos. J. Locke, Jr., of this
city, a sample bale of Johnson grass
was sent to Messrs. Sandbach Parker
and Co., of Demara, British Guiana
S. A. with the request that .Ihty
show it to their customers, calling at
tention to the difference in cost of
Johnson grass and Timothy, and
suggesting that a car of Johnson
grass be ordered to test its relative
feeding value. A copy of Prof.
Lloyd's brief on the relative feeding;
values of the different hays was also
sent them. Mr. Carter has just re
ceived the following letter in answer: J
Demarara, 10th Dec. 1915. !
W. II. Carter, Esqr.,
Secretary Manager
The Chamber of Commerce,
Columbus and Lowndes County,
Dear Sir:
We are in receipt of your letter of
the 16th, ult.
We note that you are sending us
a bale of Johnson grass hay as a
sample of that product, and note
what you write with regard to the
price at which this hay can be
bought as compared to the same
trad of Timothy hay.
We also thank you for your inter
esting data as to the relative feeding
value of other common hays, compar
ed with your Johnson grass hay.
On receipt of the sample bale
which we presume will reach us by
the Caribean & Southern Steamship
Co.'s vessel, we will have same shown
to our customers, and forward you
a report pn the prospect of business
at a later date.
Yours truly,
SANDBACH PARKER & CO.

HAPPENINGS OE INTEREST
GATHERED HERE AND THERE
CIST OF NEWS FROM OVER THE
COUNTRY GIVEN IN A BRIEF
FORM.
Statewide prohibition of the sale
and manufacture of intoxicating
liquors became effective in seven
states at midnight last niyht, putting
out of business more than 3000 sa
loons, a large number of breweries
wholesale liquor houses and distiller
ies. The states which are to enter
the dry ranks are South Carolina
Iowa, Colorado, Oregon, Washing
ton, Idaho and Arkansus.
Improved business conditions of
southern cities showed gains.
Fifteen were killed and a score in
jured, some 'fatally, and much rail
road property was destroyed in
Monterey, Mexico, Thursday, when
a box car containing dynamite and
hand grenades for the Carranza
army, wa destroyed by an explos
ion. The cars loaded with explosives
were in the center of a train crowd-
"Vanity Fair," at Princai.
That colossal film masterpiece
"Vanity Fair," with Mrs. Fiske in
the role of Becky Sharp, comes to
the Princess Theatre, Tuesday, Jan
uary 4th. This is an Edison produc
tion and easily the best ever executed
by that well known maker of good
pictures.
Needless to say a production of
sufficient size to warrant the
en"t
gagement of Mrs. Fiske is no ordin
ary film venture. More than four
hundred people were employed in
many of the big scenes, notably the
one which portrays Lady Richard
son's ball in Brussels. This scene if
in itself elaborate enough to stamp
"Vanity Fair" an extraordinary pro
duction. The antique curio shops of
Manhattan were ransacked for hang
ings and furniture of the period and
the entire mammoth floor of the Edi
son studio was utilized.
In filming the great classic, the
Edison producer made no effort to
follow the devious plot of Thackery'i
novel.

reticence concerning her military
operations there. It seems certain.
however, thst cxtremajy important
events, the full sinificanc of which
are not as yet officially disclosed,
are occurring at the only point
where Russian armies can bring any
pressure to bear on the Balkan situ
ation without actually crossing Rou
manian territory.
Many reports reach here that the
Austro-Germans and Bulgarian
forces are not only actually aband
oning all preparations for an ad
vance in Macedonia, but are actual
ly withdrawing troops from this
front, their action being attributed
to the Russia n offensive in Bessara
bia, but most of these dispatches
bear the impress of the wish being
the father to the thought.
Active operations in the near east
are now centering in Albania, where
the Servian army is said to be suf
fering from harrassing attacks made
by Albanian forces.
From the progress they have
made in Albania, it is predicted that
the Italians will soon clash with the
Bulgarians in that territory. Paris
newspupers assert that the entente
forces operating in Albania will soon
have the powerful support of Essad
Pasha, the Turkish'" leader there.
Athens claims that the diplomatic
situation $hwA a growing toidiality
between Greece and the entente
powers, France having ass-ured the
Greek government that the occupa
tion of the island of Castelorizo waf
a necessity of war and only tempor
ary. No special importance, accord
ing to this report, is attached to the
island, as its status is undefined.
A historic meeting of the British
cabinet, at which the final draft of
the compulsion measure will probab
ly be adopted, is expected. The bill
it is reported, will embody the fol
lowing principles: Compulsion to be
applied to all single men who fail to
attest; for thia purpose the machin
ery of the Karl of Derby's plan to u
made stututory and the provisions of
the law to be enacted to apply
only for the duration of the present
war.
The labor conference on compul
sion came to no decision as to its at
titude, but a strong feeling of sus
picion toward the reported raV.nvt
roluti n of the problem is ma.vfe-.t
The labor leaders probably will not
settle upon a policy until the rxnk
ami file have had an opportunity to
express their opinion.
