Aijiant, Jan. I. That forty membeis
of the ltrst Church of Chrjst Scientist
In this city w.re recently excommuni

The number includes several persons
prominent in Albany society. Among
them arc Mra, James W Cox, Miss May
S. Brower, Mr. and Mrs. W. Lawyer
Hanes and Lniery I. Wendell.
"All I tan say." said Mrs. Cox to-
I night, "is that 1 was one of the forty
' dropped fiom the ihurch, and I wits
told that the reason for my being
dropped was that I did pot lead n con
sistent Christian life. What that mcsns
I am sure I do not know. We are not
followers of Mrs. Stetson. That poor,
dear woman has been terribly abused.
We are Christian KcletitlstH and fol

of Irregular practices are too silly to
discuss."
When miestloned In regard to the mat

"Those who have been dropped from

for practising science contrary to the
rules laid down by Mrn IMdy nnd the

Albany shortly before her excommuni

church three of the local practitioners
have been dropped, and now a largo
group of their friends have been sus
pended on charges of non-attendance,
having Irregular meetings and other Im
proprieties In tho practice of Science."

following receipt of olllclal continuation
of the torpedoing of the British liner
Persia In the Mediterranean.
Overnight the atmosphere tJkt changed)
from one of supreme confidence In an
early adjustment of tho subroarlno war
fare dispute to one of cAtrcme. anxiety.
Although officials aro rmt prepared to
believe that Uio attack on the Persia Im
plies a repudiation by Austria of her
j concessions nnd nssurances, It Is realized
that unless a satisfactory explanation H
almost Immediately forthcoming" from
Vienna the two countries wil bn nearer
n diplomatic severance than ever before.
That nn Austrian submarine was re--.ponsible
for the attack Is not for . mo
ment doubted despite the ahen.-e of d-
I tails on that and other Important points.
The submarine activities In th Mediter
ranean In recent months Iihvo ben
almost exclusively those of Austrian
submarines. There are, however, other
Important eonsldo-atlons which inns' b
weighed before the United Stales a i
