PRESIDENT SPEAKS THURSDAY
Mr. Wilson Will Address Members of
the Scientific Congress and Will
Be Introduced by the
Chilean Envoy.
A great reception and ball, held
at the Pan-American Union building
last night, brought to a close
the activities of the first week of
the second Pan-American Scientific
Congress, which convened in
Washington last Monday, and is
to continue until January 8.
With the governing board of
the Pan-American Union as hosts,
and with a gay and brilliant assemblage
which included every
circle of Washington society in
attendance at the ball, last night's
festivity in honor of the Latin
American delegates to the congress
will live in the history of
the congress as one of the principal
events now taking place in
Washington with the intention of
drawing the Americas closer in
spirit. After a hard week's work
in the discussion of various questions
of political and educational
and scientific interest, the delegates
to the congress and their
friends welcomed the relaxation
the reception and ball afforded,
and every opportunity was taken
to enjoy to the full the hospitality
which can be extended in such
beautiful and inspiring scenes and
settings as the Pan-American
building affords.
President Wilson Will Speak.
The next great gathering of the congress
will be Thursday evening next,
and members of the executive committee
informed delegates present at -the
reception last night that when Prescient
Wilson addresses the congress
then, as he is scheduled to do, there
will be no other speaker except Ambassador
Suarez of Chile. the president
of the congress, who will make an introductory
speech.
Many of the visiting delegates to the
congress, who were present at the PanAmerican
Union building last night,
and who include leaders ;n the political
arid scientific thought of Latin America,
declared their belief that the meeting
here, aside from the results of the
many intricate discussions of scientific
problems that have been proceeding
daily at the score or inore of subsectional
sessions, had accomplished vast
good in cementing the friendship of the
American peoples. The hospitality
shown by the United States, on the one
hand, and the responsive chord it has
found among the visitors, on the other,
were features generally recognized as
almost historic in their significance.
Developments of the Week.
Among specific- developments of the
week's sessions the delegates have been
particularly impressed by Secretary
learning's advocacy in an address of a
pan-Americanism that could mean
"One for all; all for one,1' and by the
speech of Klihu Root, a former Secretary
of State, in which he told the:
l^ntln American delegates that "so long j
;ih tne spine 01 American ireeaom snail I
continue it shall range us side by side i
with you, great and small, for the j
maintenance of the rights of nations."
The formal proposal made b> the
1'nited States early in the week for aj
pan-American convention for arbitra-:
ion of boundary disputes and to pro- I
hibit shipments of arms to revolution- i
I nrles also continued tonight an absorbing
topic of conversation among
delegates.
There was no session of the congress
esterday. a meeting previously planned
aving been canceled to allow the delegates
a New Year day free to make calls
snd fill luncheons and dinner engagements.

churches w ill bold special service for !

and had been greeted they entered
the Hall of the Americas, where
dancing begat/ at an early hour ar/d
continued until late.
Ever\ once in a while parties left
the dancing room to stroll down the
statrcaaes to the patio to "sit out"

was this retreat that it was agreed

Says Sir Edward

tAKls, January 1.? I he
slogan sounded by President
Poincare in his message of thanks
to the brave troops of France?
"Nineteen sixteen will be our
year of victory"?is being borne
on the lips of all allied nations today.
From highest officialdom to
the lowliest peasantry there is
serenest optimism. Despite German
successes and apparent Teuton
ascendancy on practically
every battlefront in the months
marking the life of the present
great struggle, the allies todayare
more confident than ever.
President Poincare's address,
which has just been made public,
probably is the most accurate reflection
of the sentiment prevailing
not only in France, but England.
Russia and Italy, of any yet
issued.
Sentiment Determined.
"Like you. my noble friends, I have
read with emotion in the army bulletin
messages addressed to you on the eve
of the new year by the mayors of our
large cities," says President Poincare.
The same language is used by all
these French cities, and it is easy today
to draw from these numerous expressions
the unanimous sentiment of
the country.
Civery wiicre vuu nave occn maintained
without effort this sacred union
spontaneously established seventeen
months ago under the menace of the
enemy. Why would not the civil population
follow the example of the agreement
and harmony which you give it?
In the trenches and on the battlefields
you hardly think of considering your
personal opinions. Civil discord does
not disturb the fraternity of arms,
which with its common perils and identical
duties binds one and all. You
have your eyes fixed on an ideal which
constantly diverts your attention from
secondary objects, and you know that
your patriotic mission cannot be performed
by others.
"While you are thus sacrificing
everything to the salvation of the nation
is it not natural that those
Frenchmen, whose age, health or duties
prevent them from meeting at your
side the fatigue and perils of war,
should at least repel harmful suggestions
of hatred and conserve jealously the public
peace?
Interests Kept in Mind.
'The mayors of France have spoken
of .some of the charities resulting
from the successful joining of hearts.
Most of these institutions are destired
to aid you. your aged parents.
vour children, your wounded or irnpr
soned brothers. In cities farthest
from the front your condition thus remains
constantly present in all minds
and concentrates, as is well in view of
the tragic realities of the time, the
thoughts of those who might be inclined
to forget.
"The morning which has darkened
the home of so many families, moreover,
imposes on those who have been
less severely afflicted tne pious oDiiga
tiori of meditation and gravity. All the J
French people feel tbe same affliction, j
and there is riot one who does not lis-j
ten with respect, to the stern lesson of '
the day?a lesson of courage, of pa- j
tienee. of will, of calm, of confidence
and of serenity."
Resolution to Vanquish.
"Everywhere it is the same?a determined
resolution to hold fast, to
endure and to vanquish. Every one
knows the stakes of the war are great,
and that the outcome concerns not
only our dignity hut our life. Shall
we tomorrow he the vassals of a foreign
empirv? Shall our industries, our
ornrnerce. our agriculture, be placed
forever under the influence of a power
| which openly flatters itself on aspir!
ing to universal domination, or shall
! we safeguard our economic independence
and national autonomy? This is
la terrible problem, which admits of no
| halfway solution.
"Any peace which came to us with
; suspicious form and equivocal purpose
would bring us only dishonor, ruin and
servitude. The free and pure genius
of our race, our most venerated traditions.
th? ideas which are deal est to
us. the interests of our citizens, the
fortunes -of our country, the soul of the
nation, everything which has been left
by our ancestors and all that we ourselves
own would be the prey of Germanic
brutality.
Must Carry on War.
"Who. then, would, by impatience or
lassitude, thus sell to Germany the past
and future of France? Yes. certainly
the war is long. It Is rigorous and it
is bloody, but how much future suffering
are we spared by our present
suffering? No French person desired
this war. All the governments since
1871 have endeavored to avoid such a
war. Now that It has been declared
against us in spite of ourselves, we
must <arry It on with our faithful allies
until we have gained victory, the
annihilation of German militarism and
the entire reconstruction of France. To

LONDON". January 1.?The rejuvenated
Russian army, equipped
with munitions from Japan.
America and England, is engaged
in a great attack on the AustroHungarian
forces in Galicia. Reports
from Vienna and Petrograd
claim the advantage for their respective
forces, but neither capital
describes decisive resillts. The
details, which are few and conflicting,
give no definite description
of the battle line.
Berlin reports that Russian
forces in eastern Galicia have
been flanked and repulsed.
Large forces of Germans and
Austrians have been brought up
for the battle now in progress in
eastern Galicia, a Reuter dispatch
from Petrograd says.
A series of linked battles is
proceeding on the southwestern
front, it is claimed. The AustroGerman
armies under Field Marshal
von Mackensen and Gen.
Pflanger. which are engaged from
the Pripet river to the Rumanian
frontier, are estimated at 1,500,000
men.
Advantage With Buss. Claim.
"Only fragmentary news of the fight
ing has been received, but it is stated!
authoritatively that the Austro-Ger- !
man forces have made progress no- I
where; that the Russians have retired
nowhere, and, that such changes as
have occurred on this front have been
to the advantage of the Russians."
The following official statement issued
tonight by the Austrian war office
describes the recent fighting on the
eastern front as follows:
"Fighting in east Galicia continues
with undiminished violence. Yesterday
the brunt of the fighting was on our
front in the middle and lower Stripa
region. In the region northeast of
Buczacz, shortly after noon, the Russian
artillery became active, their fire
continuing until evening, when the enemy
began an attack.
Hundreds of Dead Left.
At some places they advanced four or
five times, as far as our entanglements.

owing to the severity of our fire. At
night the enemy retired to his original
positions, 600 to 1,000 paces in the rear,
abandoning hundreds of dead and
wounded. The attacks which the Russians
made near Jasolwiec, south of
Buczocz, and near L'scieczKo on the
Dniester river, met the same fate as
i those of the Middle Stripa region.
On Bessarabian Front.
j On the Bessarabian front the day was
comparatively quiet. The positions occupied
by the army of Gen. Count von
Bothmer on the upper Stripa river and
the army of Gen. Eduard von BoehmErmolli
on the Ikwa were subjected to
a hostile artillery fire. The Russian battalion
which attacked south of Erestiany
on the front occuped by the army
of Archduke Joseph Ferdinand, was
scattered. On the Styr and Bug, northeast
of Czartorysk, German and AustroHungarian
troops captured hostile advanced
posts. Near Kolodia and east of
Kafalowka we repulsed an attack.

LONDON. January 1.?Rumania is

Reuter's correspondent at Athens
says reliable information has been received

Details of Torpedoing of British
Steamship Anxiously
Awaited by U. S. Officials.
GRAVITY OF SITUATION
NOT MINIMIZED HERE
New Dangers Threaten Delations
With Central Powers. Seemingly
Just Nearing Adjustment.
Official Washington last night
anxiously awaited details of the
torpedoing of the British steamship
Persia, on which American
citizens were known to have embarked.
While it was realized that reports
expected from consular and
diplomatic representatives nugui
show that the submarine commander
was justified in sinking
the vessel, officials were not inrlined
to minimize the gravity of
the situation confronting the
United States should it develop
that there has been a violation of
American rights.
Belations Again Threatened.
New dangers, it was admitted, threatened
the relations between the United
States and the central powers, which,
seemingly, had Just been placed on the
road to satisfactory adjustment by the
assurances contained in Austria's reply
to the second Ancoaa note.
Should it develop that the submarine.
was of Austrian nationality, as
there apparently is ground for believing,
the Vienna government will
be given every opportunity to explain.
Meantime, the State Department desires.
that it be determined definitely
whether the Persia tried to escape;
whether the torpedo was fired at her
after or before she had stopped;
whether warning was given, and
whether the passengers had sufficient
time in which to leave the vessel.
Only two official dispatches concerning
the sinking of the Persia were received
by the State Department yesterday.
These were fjrom Consul General
Skinner at London, and the information
they contained virtually was identical
with that in press dispatches.
Copies immediately were transmitted to
rv :j ? * wiio?n at Hnt Snrinps. and
rreaiuciu n uovu ?*.?. - -r.?? ?
the department dispatched requests for
information to United States representatives
at Alexandria, Egypt, and other
points where survivors might be landed
or details of the attack might be
available from other sources.
Bobert McNeely Believed Lost.
One American citizen aboard the Persia
was Robert McNeely, newly appointed
consul at Aden. The belief was expressed
in official circles last night
that had he escaped some report would
have been forwarded by him, as more
than two days had elapsed since the
vessel went down.
In the absence of specific details, Secretary
Lansing last night declined to
comment upon the sinking of the
Persia. He made it clear that until the
nationality of the submarine had been
definitely established and the circumstances
of the attack were known, no
action would be taken. He apparently
was viewing the situation with an open
mind.
It was realized that should an Austrian
submarine have destroyed the
Vessel the Vienna government might
offer the explanation that there had not
been sufficient time for new instructions
conforming to the assurances contained
in the last Ancona note to reach
submarine commanders. It was pointed
out that this note was delivered to
Ambassador Penfleld only Wednesday
and that the attack on the Persia oc- j
curred Thursday.
No Data on Instructions.
Whether new instructions regarding
submarine auacKa ?uu
Vienna coincidently with the delivery,
of the note, or at some prior time, is
not known here.
Should such an explanation from |
Vienna be accompanied with proper
disavowal and provision for repara- >
tion, it was considered likely that the
United States would accept it.
Officials of the State Department are i
not inclined to doubt the good faith of
the assurances given by Austria in its
last note.

LONDON, January 1.?Next to
the I.usitania disaster, the sinking
of the liner Persia off Crete
Thursday probably means a considerably.
heavier casualty list
than that of any of the passengercarrying
ships that heretofore
have fallen victims to the torpedoes
of German or Austrian
submarines. This deduction is
based on the reports that the vessel
carried several hundred passengers
and crew, and that only
four lifeboats got away from the
vessel as she went down.
Hundreds on Board.
Unofficial figures indicate that there
were about 160 passengers on board
the Persia, a vessel of nearly 8.009
tons, and between 250 and 300 members
of carrying sixty persons, got away,
and their occupants were picked up
by a steamer bound for Alexandria.
It has not been established bow many
were able to disembark on the small
boats, but the statement is made that
nearly all aboard the ill-fated vessel
perished.

McNeely's Fate Not Known.
| Ev^ry effort is being made by Consul
'General Skinner to get some information
about Robert McNeely. the American
consul at Aden, and the two othar
! Americans known to be on the passenger
list. The British admiralty informed
Mr. Skinner it had no information
with regard to the fate of the individual
passengers. Mr. Skinner sent
a cablegram to the American consulate
lat Alexandria requesting the consul to
ascertain the fate of Consul McNeely
and the other Americans.
The Peninsular and Oriental steamship
office will issue a list of r.he actual
passengers as soon as possible. At
present only partial bookings are available.
Oraveyard of Ships.
The scene of the catastrophe, the seas
between the Island of Crete and Alexandria,
recently has been the graveyard
I of a number of fine ships, and only a
I few weeks ago the American tank
steamer Petrolite narrowly escaped the
guns of a submarine there.
The Persia was the first passenger
ship lost by t ie Peninsular and Oriental
line during the war. Just prior to the
departure of the vessel from I^ondon the
company held its annual meeting. Chair.
man Inchape remarked of the growing
anxiety caused by the enlargement of
the submarine zone and indebtedness of
this company to the British navy for
complete immunity from casualty for
I their ships, and added prophetically, ''of

may overtake us."
The officers on board the Persia, it is
learned, were ordinary booked passengers
and were not on active service in
the British army.
The crew of the Persia, numbering
between 250 and 300 men, were virtually
all Lascars.
There was not much cargo aboard the
Persia, but she was carrying very
heavy mail.
