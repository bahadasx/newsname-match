Start Offensive Campaign Against
Anstro'German Forces in
Galicia.
MUSCOVITE SUCCESSES
ALARM CENTRAL POWERS
Army Is Now Thoroughly Equi-
ped With Guns and Munitions
for Campaign.
London, Jan, 1.—The rejuvenated
llussiau army, equipped with muni­
tions from Japan, America and Eng­
land, is engaged in a great attack on
the Austro-Hungarian forces in Galli
cia. Reports from Vienna and Petro
grad claim the advantage for their
respective forces, but neither capital
describes decisive results. The de­
tails, which are few and conflicting,
give no definite description of the
battle line. Newspaper correspond­
ents in Petrograd estimate that 1,500,-.
000 Austro-Germans are engaged, and
assert that whatever changes have
occurred in the fighting line are in
favor of vhc Russians. The Austrian
war oflice official report says that the
'Russian attacks were everywhere re­
pulsed with heavy losses.
Russians Show Strength.
A significant fact is that the Rus­
sian anny. has again been able to
talcc the offensive. .Recent telegrams
from the war theater, where this
battle is raging, say that the Rus­
sians show belter lighting qualities
now than in tho earlier stages of the
war.
The result of the battle is expected
to have an important influence on the
Balkan .situation particularly on the
Roumalan policy. Apparently, Russia
lias been preparing for these opera­
tions for some time past.
Hold Up Cablegrams.
Cable communications from tue
Bessarabia regions has virtually befen
suspended- for more than a month,
thousands of messages -being Held up
until Wednesday last, when the cen­
sorship Was lifted and they began
to come through.
Try to Stop Russians.
On the various fronts, few changes
are feported. Of chief interest is the
great battle in eastern Galicia. Offi­
cial reports give lew details of the
situation there, although they empha­
size tiie severity of the fighting. Ger­
many and Austria have sent heavy re­
inforcements to meet the Russian
forces, it being reported they have
l.frOO.OOO men along the front between
the Friet river and the Itoumania bor­
der. The official German statement
of yesterday said Russian attacks
near Burkauow had been repulsed ati
tiio result of a flanking movement.
Along the Franco-Belgian front
comparative quiet prevails.
Along the Gallipoll Peninsula the
Turks are giving no rest to the
(Frcnch or British forces left behind
when the Suvla Bay and Anzac posi­
tions were evacuated. The Turkis'.i
war office announces that severe dam­
age has been done to the positions of
the Allies near Seddul .Bahr, in yie
coursc of violent fighting.

concerning the intentions of the Bul­

Gathering at Monastir.
Router's correspondent at Athens,

Serbia, and that an Austrian moun­

In consequence of reconnaissances
by 'French aeroplanes over Monastir,
machine guns have been placed on
lop of the highest buildings.
To Sehd Reinforcements.
Large forces of Germans and Aus­
trian have been brought up for the
battle now in progress In eastern Gal
licia, a Reuter dispatch from Petro­
grad says.
"A great bat'le or series of linked
battles is proceeding on the south­
western front. The Austro-German
armies under Field Marshall von Mac
kensen and General Pflanger, -who
are engaged from the Pippa river to
the Roumanian frontier, are estimat­
ed at 1,000,000 men."
Captain Tells Story.
The story of the sinking of the
French liner. Ville de la Ciotat, in the
Mediterranean on December 24, was
related by Captain Leveque who was
in command of the vessel on his ar­
rival at this port on the British
steamship, Cbrispin. He said:
"The lookout shouted 'look to the
starboard off the bow.' I hardly turn­
ed in the direction indicated when
the vessel was shaken by a heavy ex
plosion.
"I sent out a wireless call for help
and ordered all the boats out. This
was done rapidly, but not without

•Fergus Falls, Minn., Jan. 1.—Mrs
David Carr of Foxholm will leave to­
night for Winnipeg with a birta rec
ord from the town of Wrightstown
in this county, showing that her son.
who is in tlie Canadian army, was
born in 1S98. and is only 17 years old.
The boy had not been heard frnrn ft*
a year and when hto mother received
a letter from him, stating that lie
had joined the army and was about
to leave for the battlefront, she was
nearly frantic. The Canadian author­

N FUST WEEK
Thousands of Dollar's Worth of
American Condensed Milk
Is Being Shipped.
WAR MATERIALS ALSO
SHOW BIG INCREASE
Pdrt of New York Is Swamped
With Goods for Europe and
South Amcrica.
Tho large contracts for supplying
condensed milk to Europe, announced
last week, have not' yet made them­
selves apparent in the export figures
so far as relates to current condi­
tions. While exports last week of
condensed milk from the Port of New
York amounted to about $150 WJ0
value, but little of it went to Europe,
and practically none to the countries
at war. Of the $150,000 worth ex­
ported, reported by the custom house
last week, about $100,000 went to
Cuba, $10,000 to Panama, and the re­
mainder to the Netherlands. While
the exports of condensed milk have
more than doubled since the bcyiu
uliig of the war for the nine months
ending with September, 45,000,00.
pounds against 15,000,000 last year,
the large additions to the exports, ex­
pected as a result of recent con­
tracts, is not yet perceptible in the
trade returns. In fact the growth in
exports of cheese and butter is lnuca
greater than in milk, butter exports
having increased from three million
pounds to 18 millions, and cheese
from two million pounds to 56 mil­
lions.
Canned Goods Exports,
Canned goods generally, however,
do show a large increase in exporta­
tion as a result of the war. Canned
salmon, for example, amounts to 17,
500,000 for the nine months ending
with September, against $3,500,000 in
the corresponding months of 1914,
and $2,'000,000 in the same months of
1913 canned beef amounts for the
nine months to $9,500,000 against
$1,500,000 for 1914. and $500,000 fa
1913. Canned pork amounts to $1,
000,00 against one-third of a million
in the same period of last year can­
ned fruits show a less increase pro­
portionately, being million dol
lars against 2% million in the same
months of last year: while canned
vegetables amount to a little less
than two million dollars against a
little more than one million for the
same months of last year. Thus the
total value of canned goods exported
in the nine months of tho current
year for which we have department
of commerce figures are approximate­
ly 10 millions in the same months oi
191 :.
War Materials.
Exports of Avar materials continue
to run at the rate of 2% to three mil­
lion dollars per day as relates to
those for which there is a distinct
record. A considerable quantity of
material intended for war purposes
continues to go under the truthful but
somewhat misleading title of "Manu­
factures of Iron and Steel." "Scienti­
fic Instruments," "Machinery and
Parts Thereof," etc. The last week's
exports, however, showed loaded pro­
jectiles amounting to nearly two mil­
lion dollars, of which practically all
went to England: smokeless powder
lYi million dollars, practically all ot
that going to England fuses, nearly a
million dollars, chiefly to England:
gunpowder,
2%
million dollars, chief­
ly to England empty shells, approxi­
mately three million dollars to Eng­
land and Italy, and cartridges, one
half million dollars, chiefly to Eng­
land and France.
Leather Goods Increase.
The exportation of leather and its
manufacturers has enormously in­
creased since the beginning of the
war. Last week's exportation from
the Port of New York alone amounted
to approximately two million dollars,
including over a million dollars worth
of leather, nearly a half million dol­
lars vortli of shoes, and approximate­
ly 100 thousand dollars each of sad­
dlery, belting and miscellaneous man­
ufacturers. The total exports of
leather and its manufactures have
jumped from 39 million dollars in the
nine months of 1914 to 125 millions in
the nine months of 1915, for which de­
tails of the export trade are available.
Harness and saddlery exports amount
to 17 million dollars in the current
year against less than one million
last year: sole leather 20 million dol­
lars against five millions upper leath­
er 32 million dollars against 15 mil­
lions, and boots and shoes 30 million
dollars against 12 millions in the cor­
responding months of last year. Most
of this increase is. of course, to Eur­
ope. Sole leather alone to Great
Britain amounting to 12 million dol­
lars against four millions, and to oth­
er European countries six million dol­
lars against a quarter of a million in
the same months of last year, while
boots and shoes to Great Britain
amounted to 15 million dollars
against less than one million dollars
in the same months of last year, and
to France 4% million dollars against
TdM than one-quarter of a million in
the corresponding months of 1914.

Attempt to
Destroy Mass.
State House
Boston, Jan. 1.—An unsuccessful at­
tempt to dynamite! tlie state house
was made today. A bomb containing
four pounds of cxplpsives was attach­
ed to a basement ddor aud a fuse had
been lighted, but the llame apparent­
ly died before reaching the bomb.
The fact that tarred rope was used
as a fuse, according to investigators,
indicated that work was that of a
novice. A scrub woman discovered
the bomb this morning. The police
look it to a suburb and there dis­
charged the dynamite. It showed a
high explosive force.
Posse Is Searching Woods Near
Blakeley for Negroes Impli­
cated in Murder.
lJlakely, Ga.t Jan. 1.—EVteu bent, up­
on finding two of the negroes accus
ede of the murder of Henry J. Villip
igue, a white overseer, whose death
near here Wednesday cost tlie lives
of six negroes, killed by angry whites,
still searched the -Chattahoochee riv­
er swamps tonight.
Outwardly, the country was quiet,
but tlie appearance ot two automo­
biles carrying armed men, through
the town, enroute to the scene of the
recent negro killings, and the arrest
of a negro, who was threatened by
whites, caused some excitement late
today. The automobile bore men to
aid Dose seeking Mike and Ulysses
Coolsby, two negroes accused in con­
nection with the Villipigue killing.
Negroes, who had slept on back
porches or kitchens of white persons
and kept off the streets this morning,
gradually began to venture forth and
late today many were seen about t'.ie
town. A visit to the country section
west of here, where the killings oc­
curred, failed to reveal evidence of
excitement. Here and there smoke
drifted up from tbfe-^embers of a ne­
gro log hut. There were half a dozen
in Early county three days ago, and
it was said, as far as could be learned
tonight, none had been left standing.
Reports that nesro organizations
had plotted Villipigue's death because
he whipped son ot Grandison Cools­
by, one of the negroes accused later
of having a liand in the killing of Vii
lipigue, caused all log buildings, ex­
cept one, to be burned, it is said.
The one t'.iat escaped lire was torn
down by negroes to prevent, nearby
negro homes from being burned,
should it be set on tire.
Mlany Alabama citizens from just
across the state line, who rushed to
the rescue of A/ H. Grinislcy last
nig'.it, when an erroneous report was
sprea 1 that Iiis lif'' was threatened
by negroes, returned to their homes
today. Some, however, joined the
searchers in the swamps.

London, Jan. 1.—The announcement today of the sinking of the India
bound British liner, Persia, near the island of Crete Thursday afternoon,
causcd surprise.
The Persia carried more than 200 passengers, and a crew of between
200 and 300. The cargo was small. Reports received here have given
rise to a fear that a majority of the passengers were lost,
makes this the most disastrous resuu of the submarine campaign since the
sinking of the Lusitania.

Washington, Jan. 1.—New dangers
threaten the relations between the
United States and the Teutonic allies
as ?. result of the torpedoing dnd sink­
ing of the British steamer, Persia, in
the Mediterranean sea last Thurs­
day, official Washington admitted to­
night. Officials' we're not inclined' to
minimize the gravity of the situation
and further details of the sinking of
the ship on which American passen­
gers were known to have embarked
from London,were anxiousl^awaited.
American Consul .Aboard.
The absence "of any meS'Siage from
Robert McNeely, newly appointed
consul at Aden, who sailed from Lon­
don on board the Persia, has increas­
ed anxiety here. It is pointed out
that as two days have passed since
the sinking of the steamer, and.no
word has come from the United
States official, fears for his safety are
well grounded. Should it develop
chat the submarine which torpedoes
the Persia was of Austrian national*
ity, as there is apparently reason to
believe, the Vienna government will
be given every opportunity to explain,
it was said tonight.
Officials of the state department
are not inclined to doubt the good
faith given in assurances of the last
Austrian note, which has just placed
the diplomatic negotiations between
the two countries toward a satisfac­
tory adjustment. It is realized that
should an Austrian submarine have
destroyed the steamer, the govern­
ment may offer the explanation that
there had not been sufficient time for
new instructions conforming to the
assurances contained in the last An
cona note to reach submarine com­
manders.
Boat Sunk Thursday,
It was pointed out that this note
was delivered to ambassador Penfield
only Wednesday and that the attack
occurred on Thursday. Whether new
instructions regarding submarine aft1'
tacks went forth from Vienna coin
cidentally with the delivery of t_j
note or at some previous time is not
known here.
Should sucli an explanation from
Vienna be accompanied with proper
disavowal and provision made for rep­
aration. it was considered likely that
the United -States would accept it.
Meantime, the state department de­
sires that it be determined definitely
whether the Persia tried to escape
whether the torpedo was fired at her
after or before she had stopped
whetlier warning was given and
whether the passengers had sufficient
time to leave the vessel. r-
Official Accounts.
Only two official dispatches con­
cerning the sinking of the Persia
were received by the state depart­
ment. These were from Consular
Agent Skinner at London, and the in­
formation they contained virtually
was identical with that in press dis­
patches. Copies immediately were
transmitted to 'President Wilson at
Hot Springs, and the department dis­
patched requests for information to
its representatives at Alexandra.
Egypt, and other points, where sur­
vivors might be landed or where d»
tails might be available from other
sources.
Lansing la Mum.
In the absence of specific details,
Secretary iiansing tonight declined ta
ornment on the sinking of tlie Per­
sia. He made it clear that xmtll the
nationality of the submarine ^ad
been established and the circum­
stances of the attack were kaown,
no action would be taken. He appar­
ently was viewia* the sttaattoB Viik
