Republican A. P. Leased Wire
LONDON, Jan. L The
British passenger steamer
Persia, with two or more
Americans on board, was
sunk Thursdav in the East
ern Mediteranean by a sub-j
marine. It is feared that i
the disaster, from a stand
point of loss of life among
non-belligerent vovame r s.
will rank second only to the
sinking of the Lusitania.
Unofficial figures indicate j
that there were about 100
passengers on board the Per- (
sia and between 250 and :JO0 i
members of the crew. Four j
boats, each capable of carry- j
ing sixty persons, got awav, j
and tneir occupants were
picked up by a steamer
bound for Alexandria.
Robert McNeely of Mon
roe, N. C, who was on his
May to take office as Amer
ican consul at Aden, Arabia,
and Charles Grant of Bos
ton, were on the Persia.
In addition to the passen
gers who sailed from Lon
don, a large number em
barked at Marseilles. The
total booked at these points
was 231. Of these. 87 were
women and 2o children. i
The Persia was a steamer !
of 7,974 gross tons and was i
owned by the Peninsular &
Oriental Steam Navigation!
company of London. Shoj
sailed from Bombay, No-!
vember 14, for London, and
was last reported as leaving
Gibraltar on December 2.
The scene of the catastro
phe, between the island of
Crete and Alexandria, re
cently has been the grave
yard of a number of fine
ships, and only a few weeks
ago the American tank
steamer Petrolite narrowly
escaped the guns of a sub
marine there.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 1. Official
Washington tonight anxiously
awaited details of the torpedoing
of the British steamship Persia, on
which American citizens were
known to have embarked.
While it was realized that re
ports expected from consular and
diplomatic representatives might
show that the submarine comman
der was justified in sinking the
vessel, officials were not inclined
to minimize the gravity of the sit
uation confronting the United
States should it develop that there
has been a violation of American
rights. New dangers, it was admit
, ted, threatened the relations be
tween the United States snd the
central powers which seemingly
had just been placed cn the road
to satisfactory adjustment by the
assurances contained in Austria's
reply to the second Ancona note.
Should it develop that the sub
marine was of Austrian nationality,
as there apparently is ground for
believing, the Vienna government
will be given every opport'.iuity to
explain. Meantime, the stats de
partment desires that it be de
termined definitely whether the
Persia tried to escape: whether the
torpedo was fired at her after or be
fore she had stopped: whether
warning was given; and whether
the passengers had sufficient time
in which to leave the vessel.

In the absence of specific details
Secretary L?nsing tonight declined
to comment upon the sinking of
the Persia.. He made clear that
until the nationality of the subma

and the circumstances "f the at

BOSTON. Jan. 1. An unsuccessful
attempt to dynamite the state house
was made today. A bomb containing
four pounds of explosive had been at
tached to a basement door and a fuse
lighted, hut the flame apparently
died before reaching tile detonator.
Had the explosion occurred, in the
opinion of the police, the building
would have been greatly damaged.
The fact that tarred rope was used
as a fuse, according l investigators,
indicated that the bomb was the work
o a novice.
A scrub woman discovered the
bomb this morning. The police took
it to a suburb and there discharged
tile dynamite.

the advantage for their respective

description of the. battle line.
N spaper correspondents in Petro

occurred in the fighting line are in
favor of the Russians. The Austrian
war office official report says that tho

A significant lact is that ti e Russian
army hits again been able to take the
offensive. Recent telegrams from the

say that the Austrians shew better
fighting (pialities now than in the ear
lier staffs of the war.
The result of the battl is expected to
have an important influence on the

CLIFTON. "Ariz.. Jan. 1. .vii vffer
submitted by the managers of the
Arizona Cupper company through th"
Citizens' mediation committee- of
Clifton to the striking miners in the
'lifton-Morenci district, agreeing to
resume operations with former em
ployes with an extension of the pres
ent scale schedule on a basis of 2i
ce:it copper, provided the men would
surrender their Western Federal ion
of Miners charter, was voted elown
this afternoon. The proposal of tho
managers would put nearly ."..""0 me,,
at work at higher wages than have
ever before been paid in the- dis
trict and would guarantee further
increases as copper advances in price.
It w uild mean an immediate increase
of approximately r, per cent over
what the men were earning- when
they went out several months ago.
but would not mean recognition of
their demands from a union stand
point. The mediation committee, composed
of neutral citizens of Clifton, ha--been
negotiating with the union ex
ecutive committee and with the mine
managers for several days. it was
uncb istood that the onion would
agree to eliminate tile Western F-d-eiation
but would insist !! substan
tial increases. The managers were
willing to negotiate as soon as 1he-y
ascertained that the Federation would
be eliminated. The then announced
to the mediators that they were pre
pared to resume e-perati. ns provided
the strikers surrender the br-al Fed
eration charter. The further priepo
sal was to place the wage S'-ale on a
basis in accordance with the selling
price of copper. Copper stood at 19
cents when the strike was declared,
and. adopting the scale then in oper
ation, it would mean that upproxi-mate-ly
a -" pe-r cent, increase would
become effective with copper now at
2" cents.
The executive committee if the
miners this afternoon presented the
proposition to the miners. Ameri
cans, almost to a unit, voted for ac
ceptance, but the Italian miners
unanimously nnd Mexicans largely
voted against.
I'ndc-r the proposed schedule. th"
following schedule would be in
cCootinued on Pae Twoi
to warrant closing them. Those- who
did not engage in gambling laid them
selves open to suspicion because of the
use of cards, card tables, chips and
other equipment ordinarily found in
gambling establishments.
It is understood that this h' the first
move- in the direction of introducing
before the city commission, a proposed
ordinance that will effectually cover a'l
farms of gambling not now specified
in ordinances. Th- punch boards were
recently ordered out. and the tweutv
six game was placed under the ban.
These were the most (pen and flag
rant forms of gambling and in the
opinion of the city attorney strictly
amenable to the law.
The action of Chief P.risbois last
levelling in closing down all the card
games he could find in operation was
j not done under the impulse of the
.moment. It was only after the situa
Ition had been carefully reviewed and
'after he had been advised by the mayor
and the city attorney that it was not
'only within his rights, but Was bis
jduty to see that such places were
closed.
" So far as 1 am concerned." said
the chief last evening, "all gamhliuu
is going to cease in this city if it is
within my power to put a stop to it.
i" have now the necessary backing and
I am going to see to it that the law is
enforced. In visiting these; places 1 did
not attempt to ascertain whether
gambling was actually going on in my
presence, i told them to close up at
once and they did."
n most of the ground floor places
visited last evening there has been no
secret that card games have- been per
mitted. The proprietors have, bow
ever, caused it to be understood that
these games were not being played for
money and that ."I he house" received
no benefit other than increased sales
of cigars or other merchandise. It is
understood, however, that stud poker,
draw poker. pangingie, and oiher
games in which money may exchange
hands, has been played in several of
these places.
Hut the lid is on and the chief wtyu
it is on to stay.
