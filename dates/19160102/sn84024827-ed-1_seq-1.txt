of specific details Secretary Lansing
is declined to comment.' He made it
clear that no action would be taken
until the nationality of the submarine
was established and the circumstances
of the attack known.
It is realized that if it was an Austri

explanation that insufficient time had

It is pointed out that this note was

on the Persia was on Thursday.
Whether the new Instructions had
gone to submarine commanders is un
known here. Should an explanation
be made, accompanied by the proper
disavowal and a provision for repara
