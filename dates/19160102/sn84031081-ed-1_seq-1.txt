The year 1915 has closed. Tlie
coming of the new year ends a pe
riod whose events loom larger in the
history of the world tlmn those of theT
yearn Unit precede it.
The record for the hist twelve
months is one Unit hits no parallel for
bloodshed, for utter recklessness of
human life, for extravagant expendi
ture of material resources.
The sinking of the liritish haltle.ship
Formidable in the Knglish channel by
Teuton submarines on the first day of
tlii' year with a loss of r.!l lives, only
nn incident in the international trag
edy, wan the key to the succeeding,
days. Five days later a Turkish army
corps was annihilated in the Caucas
us. Within the month Russian troops
stormed and carried the passes of the
Carpathians and invaded Transyl
vania, a llritish fleet sank a Herman
b.tttlecniiser and crippled two others
in n running fight in the North sea.

The following months continued the
record of horrors, suffering and de
struction. The troops of the kaiseit
regained the ground lost to the in
vading Slavs, capturing one great fort,
toss after another, and threatening
the Knssian naval base, at Riga, tin
the west front, an almost constant
struggle ''as be''n waged from the
Kclgian coast to the Swiss border.
F.arly In October, after tremendous
artillery preparation, the French and
llritish troops left their trenches and
i.lormed the German lines, driving the
enemy from his advanced positions

waning nations.
' Though the war has fsomewhat
dwarfed the importance of other hap
penings, events of significance have
occurred in North America. The do
mestic, turmoil in Mexico has contin
ued, and the recognition of Victorlano
Carianza as the representative of the
de facto government of !hi
republlcj
failed to bring about peace.
While Kurope is being devastated
by war, prosperity has come to the
United States. American trade has
risen to the greatest total in the world,
an unprecedented occurrence. Crops
have set new records. American en
terprise has reached out to take ad
vantage of new opportunities for
trade. The New Year that comes to
foreign nations in the midst of turmoil
and bloodshed, finds America peaceful
and more prosperous than ever before.
