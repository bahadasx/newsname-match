The attitude of the Clergy al
most universally has been equally
unphilosophical, not to «ay Irrelb

been known to preach the go«pel
of hatred from their pulpit«. Not
long ago 1 had the privilege of
dining with three di«tingui«ed

All three agreed in all «olemuity
that it was the duty of their uouo.
try to take sides with the Allies,
aad pat (forth all our power to
help crush Germany, for which
they had no words severe euough
to express their execration.
I aald to them: "la It not
strange thing, that I, who do uot
pretend to be anything but a
more or less enligbteued man
should utterly reprobate your
teachings? For almost two thou
sand years the Lords of Misrule,
servants of the 'God of Battles
have had it their own way; have
sown dragon's teeth and raised
damnable harvests of warriors;
and the present war is the last
and most perfect ontoome of their
regime, would it not better be
come you preachers of the gospel
of the Prince of Peace to throw
the whole weight of your influence

to orge Immense arrangements for

mens© revenues to keeping t he pis

in the belt aud the chip on the
shoulder? So far in history the
advooates of preparedness have
bad it their own way. Why not
try yonr own gospel for three
years or for ten."
When oan we ever expect a bet
ter oppoitunity than that present
ed right now? Neither war nor
war preparations can reduce the
high ooat of living. Those two
evils only osn explsin why prioes
