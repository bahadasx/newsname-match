HENRY A. KIKER, FOR DISTRICT
ATTORNEY
Will the citizens of this great I
county of Union, embrace the pre-
t sent opiMit timity of securing the i
I services nf an able lawyer, a fair,!
! reasonable ami sympathetic gentle, i
man who is unstained as to reputa- '
I I i 1 1 1 1 . for their next district' attor
ney, or do they chouse tu go on un
der the administration of a haughty, j
political-HhtU- linaleiat -prest ue- hr.
fore - every - Uiiiil- - else candidale"? i
Mr. KikiT is such a man as Die form-
er, Orie I.. Phillips, such as the hit-1
tor. ' :
We believe tile people ut this conn
ly. now more than ever before, per
haps, sense the exceeding neces
sity of ulilainin.' the services of a
Ihistricl Attorney who wilt be at
1 once courteous and able, of broad
i syt ii pa I hies, and understanding of
I human woe, painstaking and aini
' cable in tlie diseharue of his dut
I Íes. I pon him, 1 1 1 h i than upon
ai; other public nllirial depi'tnls
;ihe safeguarding of our rights of
liberty, happiness, property, and
! even Ii I'e.
The importance of selecting a pro
per man to serve as IMstrirl Atlor-
! ney of l iiion. Ouay. Colfax and Taos
Uuuinties at this lime, warrants lho
(rouble of a rather searching ex
i animal urn into the reputations and
j ch.'tractifrs id" tle tiwo iihmi who
j seek the position. Mr. Kiker is the
i I leiuocratic Nominee for that ollice
ami every citien is urged to tn
ipiire about him in (he cities of Cim
arron and It at i o i where he has res
ided for several years. It is wish
ed that the voters of I'nion cooiinty
might ascertain what the people of,
his county think of ,uot only hi
integrity and ability, but of his
private liTo as well. If yoi are in
doubt as to the kind of man he is'
and as to whether he is entitled to
your vote , this will convince you,
for the consensus' of opinion of the
general jnrblic of ' a' man' . in ' the
community in which lie has long
resided in the best index obtainable
to his character. The News has
taken great pains to learn how Mr.
Kiker stands in Colfax, and has
found that he is held in the high-
st esteem by all who know him, no
matter what the complexion of
their politics. Mr. Kiker will have'
the great' corporate interests of Col
fax against him: and when the re
putation of Mr. Kiker is being in
vestigated it might also be well to
ask the cause of this condition, and
why those interests are for Phillips?

i The. Ziegelaar's lived together on
the' fal-m. About August 10th, Mrs.
LZiegftlaar suddenly disappeared. The
neighbor questioned Ziegelaar
about the disappearance and were
told that "She has left mo and gone
away, I don't know where". The
neighborhood being suspicious, re
ported the matter to officers, who
arrested Ziegelaar and held him
while. they made investigations, but
could find no evidence on which to
hold him. - At that time Ziegelaar
claimed that he had telegraphed and
written every place where his wife
might have gone, but no answers
were received. The officers were
so suspicious of foul play that they
had Ziegelaar committed to the yi
sane asylum at Las Vegua, in or
der to hold him, as it waa his evi
dent desire to skip the country. Find
ing' of the body Friday afternoon,
leaves no doubt of the guilt of Zieg
Jaar, and he will now be returned to
Clayton for indictment and trial.
Ziegelaar is about 45 or 40 years
old, whilo Mrs. Ziegelaar was al
most sixty.
