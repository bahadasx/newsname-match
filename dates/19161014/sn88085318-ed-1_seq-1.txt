An eastern illustrated paper
has an [Dominated picture of a
harvest scene in Nottinghamshire,
England, where all the work is
being carried on by young women,
the men all being away at the war.
A vote for Hughes and the muni
tions makers will bring the pic
ture just that much nearer home.
An eye-open>er for those who
?till think that Wall street can
control the presidential voter, is
the report of the Literary Digest
investigation of the labor union
vote of the country. In its issue
of Oct. 7, reports were given
from 457 labor union leaders,
representing 114 unions, as to the
way the members of these unions
are going to vote for president.
Out of the 457 officials reporting,
382 said that their members fa
vored Wilson, 47 found for Ben
son the socialist, 43 said their
members favored Hughes, and 34
believed the vote was evenly di
vided, or were non-committal.
The 1916 tax payment which is
required by the state from Ste
vens county will be $69,659, ac
cording to figures just received
by Assessor Dodson. This is a
one-third reduction from the
amount required of this county in
1918 before Governor Lister had
any chance to hold down appro
priations. Tax money demanded
by the state from Stevens county
for previous years was: 1913,
$101,506; 1914, $97,527; 1915,
$89,000; 1916, $91,538. This
shows a gradual decrease as Gov
ernor Lister's administration was
able to cut into the porkbarrel
funds, and is one startling reason
why his reelection is being so bit
terly contested by certain politi
cal interests of the state. The
"easy money" is not easy under
Lister; while it takes less money
from the taxpayer, the farmer,
the laborer, the home owner, it
also brings less money into the
pockets of the state hangers-on at
the state capital.
The contest for governor of
this state seems likely to develop
into a hard fight. The element of
political partisanship is being
gradually lost sight of in the
other issues which have been
brought to light in the campaign,
and just now it seems that the
wet and dry question is upper
most. The fact that Mcßride,
the republican nominee, has long
been known as a wet sympathizer,
and that he was supported in 1908
by the liquor men's association,
the Royal Arch, is being strongly
urged against him by the drys of
the state, regardless of party
lines. In the primary, the anti
saloon league refused to indorse
Meßride, giving an indorsement
to only two men—Governor Lis
ter, democrat, and W. J. Sutton,
who was beaten by Mcßride in
the primary. Now the dries who
supported Sutton are supporting
, Lister and the wets who supported
>ther candidates are for Mcßride,
thus making a direcflineup, with
the brewery bill and the hotel
bill as buffer arguments.
It hardly seems possible that
this state will ever again revert
to liquor control, or that either of
the liquor bills will pass. But it
has been promised that at the last
moment a considerable amount of
money will be put into the cam
paign for these purposes with an
effort to win, hence the present
spectacular fight for the advan
tageous position of having a gov
ernor in full favor with the side
which wins.

George Turner, Poindexter's op
ponent in the race for election to
Jhe senate, this week in an inter
view in Seattle. Mr. Turner de
clared that Pinchotism had done
more harm to the Pacific north
west and Alaska "than an army
of locusts" and that Poindexter
by his record in supporting this
conservation scheme "wrote him
self down as a follower of the
Pinchot idea of conservation."
The Z canyon project has been
held up for nearly eleven years
because of the withdrawal of a
small amount of land in that sec
tion. Judge Turner takes the
stand that projects like this should
be thrown open to the people on
terms that would allow the de
velopment to proceed under laws
which will protect the public and
he declares that he will work and
vote for laws to that end.
W. A. Haskins of Marcus, demo
cratic candidate for state repre
sentative, is a man peculiarly
fitted to represent Stevens county
in the next legislature, by reason
of his active work for good roads,
and his thorough knowledge of
this county.
Mr. Haskins is 48 years of age.
He came west from Wisconsin
when a young man, and settled
at Grant's Pass, Ore., where he
made a record for management of
municipal affairs in several terms
as councilman. After successful
ly managing large lumber inter
ests there for some time, he came
to Deer Park, Wash., and looked
after the interests of the Pine
Lumber Co. of which he was presi
dent until that institution sold its
interests. He moved to Marcus
in 1905 and engaged in real es
tate and lumbering, being the first
mayor of Marcus, and having
made a success of all his business
ventures.
He has no delusions in regard
to the work needed in the legis
lature, and to the necessity of this
county being strongly represented
in order to ni-i proper attention.
Ah the next session will have tln
road matter before it, Mr. Mas
king has made himself familiar
with all the points of information
relative to this county's condition,

general recognition will be given

Joseph 11. Stemraer of Chewe
lah, democratic candidate for
county engineer, is a graduate of
the Michigan College of Mines,
look the degree of civil engineer
in 1903, and is .'il years of age.
His engineering work lias largely
been in the west, lie having been
engaged in the location and con
struction of the S. I. & S. between
Portland and Spokane, and in the
location and construction of the
\V. W, P. Co, interurban line be
tween Cheney and Spokane, for
several years. He was in charge
of location and construction of ir
rigation works at Bridgeport, and
also in the Methow valley. Later
he was assistant engineer of the
city of Coeifr d'Alene, and became
city engineer of Chewelah 5 years
ago, having gone there for that
city's street improvement work.
County Engineer R. Ts. Thomas
prevailed upon him to take charge
of the permanent highway con
struction work in this county, and
for four years he has given per
fect satisfaction in this important
work.
Mr. Stemmor's experience cov
ers civil, hydraulic and municipal
engineering, besides which he has
done mining engineering, assaying,
jiihl has been U. S. mineral sur
veyor, His record of results
makes him a man worth securing
for this county's engineering <>!'
flee, as few counties have the op
portunity to secure for county en
gineer a man with his varied and
successful experience.
Seeing that Mcßride, republi
can candidate for governor, and
opposed to Governor Lister, has
come out in favor of the drys since
nomination, the Bellingliam Her
ald, a republican paper, says:
"The liquor interests are, above
all things, practical. They are
opposed to local option in any
reasonable form. But they are
supporting Mcßride for governor.
Why? Is it reasonable to believe
that they would be supporting
Mcßride unless they knew posi
tively that he was favorable to
them? They are earnestly seek
ing the nomination of Henry Mc-
Bride. John A. Mellquist, re
corder of the Knights of the Royal
Arch Cthe liquor order) in Bellinfc
l.aiTi, says that he knows that Mc-
Bride will be favorable to the sa
loon. How does lie know it? It
is very unlikely that Me Bride
would be deceiving the liquor in
terests. The liquor interests have
been in polities for a long time mid
are not apt to be deceived where
their own interests are at stake.
Mcßride. then, must be playing
unfair with the public "
