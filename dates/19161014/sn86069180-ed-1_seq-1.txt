IRELAND
Itcdmond in Address at Water
ford Says Home Itnle Is
Certain.
Conscription "Would Be Scandal
That Would King Around
tho World.
Nationalists Demand Early Dis
cussion of Irish Question in
the House.
NEVER FAVORED A PARTITION
The British Parliament assem
bled Tuesday for the autumn ses
sion, when Irish Nationalists de
cided to make an effort to have
the Irish question discussed in the
House of Commons as early as pos
sible. John Redmond was requested
to give notice of the following mo
tion a,nd ask facilities for its dis
cussion: "That the system of gov
ernment at present maintained In
Ireland Is inconsistent with the
principles wherefor the Allies are
fighting in Europe and is or has
been mainly responsible for the
recent unhappy events and for the
present state of feeling In that
country."
In a notable address to his con
stituents at Watorford" on Friday of
last week John Redmond, the Irish
Natlonlllst leader in Parliament,
declared that, despite tho recent
rebellion, "with all Its inevitable
aftermath of brutalities, stupidities
and inflamed passions," home rule
for Ireland is safe If Ireland re
mains sane. He also declared that
conscription could never bo forced
upon Ireland, adding: "I can not
b.rlng myself to believe that, malign
though the Influences at work are,
the Government "will bo insane
enough to challenge a conflict with
Ireland on this subject. Conscrip
tion for Ireland, far from helping
the army and the war, would be the
most fatal thing that could happen.
It would be resisted in every vil
lage In Ireland. Its attempted en
forcement would be a scandal which
would ring around the world. It
would produce no additional men."
Continuing, the Irish Parliament
ary leader said: ""The mere threat
Is paralyzing recruiting, which
Is not dead as some people say. The
latest figures inded show that from
the date of the rising (Easter Sun
day) until September 6,000 recruits
wore received, this aemana ior
conscription is not a genuine mili
tary demand. It is a base political
device put forward by men who
want to injure and discredit Ire
land's political future and revive by
any and every means bad blood be
tween the two countries, in the
wicked hope that when the war Is
over the British people may tolorate
some attempt to repeal tho homo
rule act. But whatever the motive
back of the proposal may be, It will
never be carried through the House
of Commons as long as the Irish
party remains as It Is today, united
and entitled to speak for Ireland.
The way to continue to get recruits
Is far different. Appease the in
flamed feeling In Ireland. With
draw martial law. Make it plain
that the defense of tho realm act
will be administered not as it Is
being administered now In different
parts of Ireland, but In the same
spirit as It Is administered in' Eng
land,, Scotland ana waies, ureal
prisoners arrested during the rising
as political prisoners. Put an end
to insults and attacks upon Ireland
and recognize generally what she
has done. On these lines the Gov
ernment may succeed in recruiting
even after all that has happened.
But as for conscription, In that way
lies madness, ruin and disaster."
The Irish leader also said It was
absolutely false that he or his col
leagues ever favored a scheme pro

'tno ancient nation! The Lloyd
George plan which -;as favored was

the war, ho continued, its object
being to glve twety-slx counties
an opportunity ofSjnducing the
other six counties to-como in volun
tarily after the war by an exhibi
tion of .successful, tolerant, sane
government in tho Soutn and West.

of tho war. NothTfig has altered,
nor can alter that$unless It be a

true that the Goverft'ment Is pledged
to introduce an amending bill when
the act comes lnto"pperation. That
bill must bo considered on its mer

comlng In at first. For my part, I
would oppose a provision in the
amending bill which provided for
the permanent exclusion of any por
tion of Ireland! For good or ill,
that scheme is dead."
Mr. Redmond said that the pres
ent situation was the most trying
crisis In his recollection, and that a
bad blow was struck at Ireland by
the uprising. "All through our his
tory," he continued, "some malign
influence has seemed over at hand
Just on the eve of victory to dash
the cup -of comfort from the lips of
Ireland, and unfortunately almost
always that Influence has como from
Ireland herself. The constitutional
movement must continue," ho de
clared. "It would be putting our
people down as fools If It was seri
ously proposed that they abandon
or break up that movement In favor
of the Insane ideals of those who
have Invited Ireland once again to
have recourse to arms against the
British empire."
It was Impossible, however, he In
sisted, that tho relations with the
Government could be as they were
before, and the Irish party found
Itself absolutely In opposition to the
coalition Government, for It was
face to face again with tho Unionist
stronghold in Dublin Castle. So far
as the war Is concerned, he said,
Ireland's attitude was unchanged,
and she would do nothing calcu
lated to postpone for one instant
the victorious ending of the con
flict. "I appeal to the sane men of
Ireland," he added, "to rally to pro
tect her from tho conspiracy of all
that Is flckle, foolish and Irrespon
sible now on foot."

REPUBLICANS DESERTING OWENS
As the date of election day draws.
nearer tho Republican party leaders
are becoming more and more panic
stricken and are straining every
nerve. to check tho steady drift to
Wilson, the latest movo being to
flood the country with Wall street
and trust boodle funds In a des
perate effort to buy tho election for
Hughes. Politicians predict that
the Republican campaign fund this
tlmo will be tho largest ever used
In the history of American politics
and there aro dally evidences of tho
proof of this prediction. Right
here in Kentucky thousands of dol
lars are being spent to liven up
interest In tho Wall stret candi
date, and on his appearance hero
Thursday money was spent like
water in the purchase of bombs
(and bums), flags, torchlights, etc.,
along the line of march to whoop
things up for Hughes. The saloons
where negroes congregate and the
levee front was raked high and dry
to bring this element to Phoenix
Hill the other evening, while the
local Republican district leaders
made personal canvasses through
theso districts distributing Hughes
badges to be used the following day
and buying rounds of drinks In
numerable for tho thirsty colored
brother. ,
Every straw vote taken lately
from every part of the country
Bhows tho same results gains for
Wilson and corresponding losses for
Hughes. The following significant
statement Is taken from the Now
York Herald, which Is making ex
tensive efforts to secure a nation
wide straw vote:
"IN THE VOTE THUS FAR
TAKEN IN ALL OF THE DE
BATABLE STATES IT HAS BE
COME MORE APPARENT THAN
IT WAS A WEEK OR TWO AGO
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS GAIN
ING AND MR. HUGHES SLIP
PING." The Herald can be classed as a
supporter of Hughes, and when It
concedes this much to President
Wilson tho outlook is not very
bright for the G. O. P. Further
along tho Horald again says: "The
Republicans have given up all ex
pectations of a landslide, and we
believe tho result is very much In
doubt." In every part or tho coun
try straw votes are being taken by
traveling men both on trains and
in tho cities where they stop, and
In every instance not only a major
ity Is Bhown in favor of Wilson, but
an overwhelming majority at that.
One of the traveling men for
Belknap's, a local concern, has Kept
tabulation on these votes taken in
his travels and the figures aro cer
tainly gladdening for Democracy.
The German-American vote,
which was clalmod so strongly by
tho Republicans at the outset of
the campaign, Is now supporting
Wilson In preference to Hughes,
backed by Roosevelt, as they real
ize the latter In his bitter hatred
for Germany and German-Ameri
cans, would stoop to anything for
vengeance, and that as the Republi
can Secretary of State he would be
in a position to do much harm.
Roosevelt blames the German
American vote for defeat in the
Chicago convention and he is back
ing Hughes with the object of being
ST. LOUIS BERTRAND'S PARISH.
the denominating factor In the
Hughes Cabinet. This latter fact
Is also frightening away the lovers
of peace, who know that Roosevelt
Is aching to war with somebody for
nothing- else than to allow him to
pose as the Rough Rider leader,
ranting up and down In the lime
light breathing Are and brimstone.
The story In theso columns last
week that tho local Republicans are
preparing to knife Owens created
consternation in tho Republican
camp and the supportors of tho for
mer Democrat and Bull Mooser are
threatening to retaliate. The story
Is that Chilton and Searcy aro plan
ning to concentrate their strength
behind Lucas for Police Court
Prosecutor, as the local machine
dictators figure that in the event
of Hughes' election Hert, tho new
State boss, will get all the pie, so
they are going to play for "local
safety first."

GRIEVES THE PONTIFF.
Pope Benedict, in a letter to Car
dinal von Hartmann, Archbishop of
Cologne, and other German Arch
bishops, laments that his invitation
in behalf of peace has given rise to
suspicion on one side and open
offense on the other, as If Instead
of being dictated by an ardent de
sire to settle th quarrel justly it
bad been dictated by the hope of
securing advantage to himself. The
Pontiff adds tnat periumauon oi
Bplrit has prevented normal Judg
ment and tho recognition of the
truth, so that what to many is self-
evident becomes Obscure, namely
that "The Pontiff, the Vicar of tho
King of Peace and the father of all
Christians, In consequence of his
high ministry and admonish, per
suade and exhort In behalf of peace
peace not in favor of one party,
but of all humanity." The letter
closes with a prayer that peace may
Boon return.

War Has Caused Situation That
Calls For Serious
Thought.
Our Disturbed Conditions De
mand the Attention of Cath
olic Citizens.
Must Concern Themselves With
Problems That Confronts
. . This Country.
WHAT SOCIALISTS ARE DOING
..
Hmj:ptt!!M
The unusual conditions t produced
by the great war have given this
country a momentary period of ex
cessive prosperity. It is also a
period of excessive disquietude. Tho
prices of some of the most necessary
of commodities have gone up by
leaps and bounds. The threatened
rise in bread prices has led to the
demand for a Federal Investigation
into the reasons for such action,
and local investigations on tho mat
ter have already been begun. Strikes
and lockouts in somo Instances have
been the order of tho day. Tho
garment workers, turned out of tho
shops by their employers in tho
metropolis, after a stubborn strug
gle forced tho latter to return to
tho orderly regime of tho protocol.
On the Mesaba range' In Minnesota
the Iron oro workers hearkened to
the appeal of the Industrial Work
ers of the World and threw down
their tools. The machinists and
longshoremen won victories without
much effort, as the time was op
portune for them. Milk wagon
j drivers and Ice men In the summor
months demanded changes, and by
their strikes seriously incon
venienced many cities. The traction
employes in several places have
made moves for better conditions,
culminating in tho strike in New
York, which threatened several
times to assume enormous propor
tions. Tho huge railroad difficulty
sent a chill of fear through all
classes of the people. Tho workers
have determined to take advantage
of tho present situation to get what
they can out of tho profits which
are being made and to try to keep
pace -with tho higher cost of living.
These conditions certainly de
mand serious study on the part of
all our citizens. They are artificial
and unstable, and unless properly
directed arp likely to lead to se
verely evil consequences when the
reaction from the flush times comes.
This has been pointed out several
times before. Tho leaders of public
thought throughout the country are
beginning to call attention to it and
to warn the people of the necessity
of preparing for the change which
Is sure to come on the cession of
European hostilities. In the eco
nomic history of tho United States
there have been recurrent seasons
of high prices and strikes and re
sultant high wages; but there has
never been a period of such uncer
tain factors as at the present time.
The war has in fact produced an
abnormal condition that Is of the
most unmeasurable character.
In. tho United States, a3 In other
countries, tho radical elements are
determined to tako advantage of
this situation. The Socialists are
already busy at work. In the New
York Call of October 1 tho wonder
ful growth of the party in this
country, from 96,000 votea In 1900
to 900,000 votes In 1912 is shown,

not idle. In California they are
