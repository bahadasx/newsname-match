SAVS GERMANY
WILL NEVER
BOW m
Editor of Cologne Gazette De
clares Nation Will Not Be
"Knockod Out."
REPLIES TO LLOYD-GEORGE
Asserts Allies' Press Campaign
Against Peace Has Helped
Strengthen Kaiser.
By CARL W. ACKERMAN.
COLOGNE. Oct. H. "If those fellows
make peace only when Germany la
'knocked out," then wo will never make
peace!"
This emphatic declaration enme to
day from Ernest Posxc, chief editor of
(ha Cologne Gazette, and probably Ger
many's greatest editor.
His thirty-two years connected with
that powerful journal makes his per
haps tho best unofficial spokesman of
the empire. In replying to Lloyd
George's recent statement to the United
Pit ss that tho war must go on to a
finish.
'Tor weeks tho allies havo conduct
cd a press campaign against poace, es
pecially at Washington." said Poize.
"Tho have said repeatedly that there
will bo no peace until we are broken,
until (hey reach tho nhlno.
"These statements havo strengthened
our position enormously. In my opinion
tho military situation Is better today
than It was a year ago. The allies will
iJver bo able to break tho west front,
whjlo tho situation on other front may
improve. Tho people are filled with con
fidence In Von Hlndenburg."
Sees No Success.
"Can President Wilson make peace?"
he was asked.
"This war Is so enormous that the
methods for bringing peace which ap
plied formerly do not apply today,"
he replied. "An international con
gress cannot settle It. The only plan
. la for Wilson, through ambassadors,
to suggest that special envoys meat
In Washington, but I don't believe this
would succeed now.
"The allies want peace on their own
terms, wnich we certainly will not con
sider Here, as elsewherr, there arc
lioace- at any price folk, but tho Ger
man people as a whole want peaco
only when we can exist as a nation."
Three .things, the Garotte editor con
siders essential to peace so far as Ger
many is concerned:
Germany's Demands.
First The military situation must be
lonsidercd; Gci many must follow
Ulamarck's policy of protecting her
western boundary, perhaps by taking
tho French fortress of Belfort, and as
the Chancellor Indicated, she must
have an Independent Poland on her
other frontier to protect her ngalnst
Husslnn uggression.
Second Germany must develop and
protect her agrlcultuial resources so
that she will no longer be dependent
on Argentine or Russia for wheat or

War Prisoners on
Liner Defy Search
Three German Subjects Bury
Themselves in Coal for
Four Days.
HALIFAX, N S Oct. 11. How three
German prisoners of war escaped, got
aboard a steamer at Bordeaux and
dctled search for four days, was told
when tho men were landed here early
today. As the steamer was about
to sail from Bordeaux orders came to
hold her. For two days she lay at
her dock while- military authorities
and crew literally combed her Insldei,
without avail. Two days out from
fiort another search led into the coal
lunkers. There the Germans were
found. Thoy had dug themselves In,
had a liberal supply of coal dust-caked
bread, and had been getting water
by dropping a can with a string at
tached through tho bilge exhaust.
Only a thorough digging discovered
the Germans, as they had not only
burled themselves, but whenever a
searcher approached, they covered
their eyes with lumps of coal.
Tho men were transferred at sea to
the steamer which brought them here.

was moving In nn easterly direction.
Tbe submarine was sighted some dis
tance from the neutral vessel, whlon
was signaled by wireless from the sin
marine asking her name and nationals.) .
It was given, and the question asked in

"Who aro you?"
"German submarine from Newport,
good-by," was the reply.
The assumption was that she was
tho U-W, responsible for tho shipping
raid of Sunday, and this rcpoit Is the

hoping. They hoped so hard tho railing
cifished In and lliemen had to bo enll

The President's lotlex was written In
response to Inquiries from Governor
Whitman as to the reasons for the ein

While the Chief Executive expresses
the belief that conditions In northern

the border may bo reduced, he declare
that he "would bo very sorry to hn.
It supposed their retention on the border
Is for any mere purpose of completiiK
their military training, or Indeed n ty
less commanding purpose than the pi ex.
