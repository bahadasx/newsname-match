LONGSHOREMEN BACK AT WORK
As Murder Trial Closes, Rossi Pleads Unwritten Law
_c *
RICH IDAHO MAN WILL
KNOW FATE BY TONIGHT
By L. D. Angevine
WAM.ACK, Idaho, Oct.
14,—I'roseeutor Hull today
made his final argument for
eon \ let ton of Merman Koasi,
on trial for the murder of
Clarence l>ul<|ulst, artist.
Rossi is one of the wealthiest
men in Idaho. The ease goes
to the Jury l»efore nigh).
Kossi is pleading the unwritten
Jaw. in his final attack today,
however, the district attorney
disregarded that <l. fen * and as
■aulted the temporary iUHanity
tlieory of the accused.
He cited tbe testimony of Jus
tice of the Peace Walker, who
swore Rossi told him all details
of the shooting shortly after it
occurred. The state contends an
Insane man would not have been
sufficiently rational to do this.
John I. Gray, a close personal
friend of Rossi, is defending him.
Calling on the jury to acquit,
Gray cried: "I am not pleading
for fee. 1 am pleading for the
life or my friend. If there were
more men like Rossi we could
raize our jails and chop down the
gallows."
The climax In the trial came
when Rossi took the stand to tell
in his own words of his fight to
save Airs. Rossi from dishonor
and to outline the events leading
up to the shooting of her al
leged violator.
Rossi spoke with noticeable
effort. His voice, usually dee]),
was shaky.
After enumerating his long
list of public offices, including
the presidency of the state hoard
of education, lie reached the
story of bis marriage to the
woman whose weakness brought
tragedy and ruin to him.
"Do you know where she is
now?" Interposed Attorney Gray.
"Not — definitely, replied
Rossi.

The defendant*, fighting for liis life <'n tha witness
stand, led tip to tlie night of tlie shooting, when lie came to
his home and found his wife drunk, with lhe marks ol an
intruder on her body.
"I—went—home." Rossi's breath began coming sharply
now. "1 saw no one downstairs until 1 got to the kitchen.
There 1 saw Ruth Melville (the maid). I asked —" Road
was tt niggling to control himself now —"where is .Mrs.
Rossi? Mrs. Melville said upstairs.
"I went upstairs. The bedroom door was partly opened.
As 1 looked in I saw the glass broken in a picture frame.
The next —thing—I—saw—was—" Rossi's voice began to
shake ''—the lop of the brass bed all bent down.
Breaks Under Ordeal
"As I opened the door—l saw—my w xix —" tha tortured
man turned suddenly and buried his bead on his arm
against the judge's desk. Sobs shook him lor whole
minutes.
" —lying, as I recall it, with a silk night gown on—on
lop of the bed. Her limbs were —uncovered. The night
gown, which had no arms, was simply banging. She lay
there in a seeming stupor. The first thing—that struck me
—as she lay there —with her mouth open—apparently
asleep, on her left shoulder—was a black mark—about
the size of a—dollar.
"I rushed up to the bad—AND SAW—" Rossi nearly
collapsed. He swayed under the weight of his grief until
ie seemed he would fall from the chair, lie sobbed and
sobbed.
" —saw her neck—and breast—" another pause. "I
GRABBED HER, AS I RECALL El!"
Rossi half arose, with a clenched Rst in the air. his face
working, his eyes set on the floor before him, as if he
saw her there. <
Then He Hit
"I HIT!" the clenched fist swung; down. " 'You
—. who's DONE—this?" Rossi's voice was now a dry
shriek.
"She hollered." be gasped. "'DON'T, DADDY!
DON'T HIT ME.'—RUTH' . . . 'TELL MX!"
Rossi stood with his hands clenched, his arms ten-c, hiss
ing the words " ' you, TELL me."
"'(iabey Dalquist—waa here, but—l—' " Rossi buried
his head again. "'I don't know what he did; lie didn't
tlo anything while I was—conscious.' "
"I recall—l—thought I grabhed Ruth hy tbe throat—
and —shoved her against the wall. I—l asked her. 'Why
have you permitted my home to be debauched like that?
Why—why didn't you call in my friends?'
"I—l don't remember what she said—something about
not being mistress of my home. I—l don't recall any
thing else--except—l—fl'sketr 'HOW LO\ T(i WAS
THIS CUR—HERE?' And sbe said three nights."
Loses All Faith
"I DON'T RECALL ANYTHING UNTIL MRS.

HOTEL. I FOUND MYSELF— POINTING—A

"Since my confinement," concluded Rossi, "I have
been informed —" he started a net' sentenc" : "/ HAVE
LOST ALL FAITH IN—" Rossi sucked in his breath,
suddenly "—THAT WOMAN! 'IF / WERE TO HE
