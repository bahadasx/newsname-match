FONTENOT IS SWORN
ST., LANDRY'S SHERIFF
POPULAR OFFICIAL TAKES
CHARGE OF POSITION LONG
FILLED BY M. L. SWORDS
'Ali hail St. Landcy's new Sher
iff! Behold Marius M. Fon- -
tenot, popular y o u n g Creole
now sheriff of the once empire
parish of Louisiana.
Darius l0. Fontenot, after hav
ing filed his assessment rolls and
having virtually completed 'his
duties as assessor, was sworn in as
sheriff of this parish, by Henry
L^astrapes, Jr, clerk of court` of the
sixteenth judicial district court, on
Monday morning. Mr. Fontenot im
mediately took charge of the of
fice, which was filled by the late
lamented Marion L. Swords for six
teen years. -
Mr. Fontenot was chosen the
democratic standard bearer on Au
gust 15th, last, defeating Charles
Thibodeaux for the democratic
nomination for sheriff by a safe
vote. He goes into office un
der the most favorable auspices and
his countless friends and support
ers predict for him an enviable
record.
We understand that the young
sheriff announces that he proposes
to bring both sides of his office up
to' a high standard, and does not
intend to permit factionalism and c
partizanship to enter therein. This
is a splendid determination. The I
offices belongs to the whole people, c
and should be exercised solely in t
their interest.
We shall support the new sher- E
iff in all of his efforts to bring I
about a better era in our parish, to
the end that the laws shall be im- 1
partially enforced and our people I
made better and happier.
NEWSPAPER MEN INDICTED I
D. D. Moore,editor of the Times
Picayune, and W. J. Leppert, are
porter, have been indicted for crim- i
inal libel, charges of which were
preferred by Dr. Clarence Pierson.
It will be remembered that sev
eral months ago the Times-Pica
yune published a series of articles {
purporting to prove that Dr. Pier
son, superintendent of the Jackson I
Insane asylum, had 'committed
many criminal acts.
The Timnes-Picayune is the same t
paper, it will be remembered, i
which so vehemently attacked Fred i
J. Grace's management of the Land
office. This newspaper challenged
Mr. Grace to answer all questions I
purported to him; when Mr.. Grace t
so conclusively proved that the 4
Times-Picayune was in error, this a
paper never had another word to 1
say about the matter.
Following is what the Iberville
* South has to say concerning the
matter:
"We do not believe that the t
courts will sustain the efforts of
these yellow journalists to berate,
discredit and dishonor men who t
, are in every way theirsuperiors and
who, with the consent of the peo
ple, occupy positiohs of responsi
bility, trust and honor."
MRS. WILLIAIM LIGHTLY ,
Died at the residence ..of her
brother-in-law, Mr. E. A. Bode
muller last Thursday night at 12:30
o'clock. The funeral which took.
place at the Catholic Ohurch wsa
Slargely attended. The Clarion ex
tends its condolences to the be
reaved family.

Mr. Ben Riseman one of the
progressive merchants of this city
returned Thursday from Memphis,
Tenn, where he had been sum
moued to attend the funeral of his
father. Mr. Riseman had been sick
for some time, but the family
never thought that the end was so
near. The Clarion offers its condo
lence to Mr. Riseman and family.
The Candy Kitchen is receiving
the new fixtures for their new
home, and when their home is fin
ished it will be the finest in this
section. Their stock is the very
best and service secoird to none.
J. E. Dailey, prominent member
of the police jury from the second I

THAT STATE BOARD
OF AFFAIRS
THE CLARION INVITES DIS
CUSSION BY BOTH
SIDES
The professional politician,, and
every would-be friend of the "dear
people" seem to have lost sight en
tirely of all the other constitutional
amendments to be voted on at the
approaching general election in
November, except the amendment
providing for' the organization of
the State Board of Affairs.
The reason of this activity, is
largely attributabile : to .the, fact
that the T"eas.uren 4uestion has' to
do. with taxation and assessment,
subjects, with ress p c t to
which the peopleare
very sensitive atd slow to act.
Some days ago Judge Gilbert L.
Dupre. called a mass meeting on
his own initiative, and proceeded to
lambast this proposed legislation in
a vigorous and lengthy speech.
Subsequently on Wednesday night
Representative E. K. Eastham called
a meeting for the purpose of speak
ing in advocacy of the measure,
Judge E. T. Lewis having also ad
dressed the meeting.
The Clarion approves of this
method of discussion of great pub
lic questions, and from now on in
vites the proponents and opponents
of this particular amendment as
well as any other proposed amend
ment, to use a reasonable amount
of space for discussion of them,
thoughf it must be well understood
that such discussions should be ar
gumentative, and entirely free
from personalities or factionalism.
We confess no patience with the
hue and cry raised against the pro
posed State Board of Affairs on the
ground that taxes and assessments
will be increased and arbitrary
powers bestowed and exercised.
Gov. Pleasant was elected to the
chief executiveship of this State in
both contests by the largest pop
ular majority ever given a candi
date. His votes and his political
strength sprang from the common
people, the hewers of wood and
drawers o arer, and it is incon
c b b.elievable that he
would permit 3.ny oppressive legis
lation to be placed upon the stat
ute books during his term of office.
Besides Gov. Pleasant is one of
the youngest and miost soccessful
politicians ii the Soith. His whole
future is before him and he knows
as-well as any other man that any
attempt upon the part of his ad
ministration to raise taxes, increase
the burdens on the people,.or un.
duly centralize power, would be
utterly destructive of any other
political aspi-stion upon his part.
We hear some of the very men to
day who formerly proclaimed the
Governor's honesty of purpose and
unbending fidelity to the rights of
the common people, now loudly
preaching that this measure of the
Governor is designed to oppress
the people with heavier tax bur
dens and machine politics.
Let the discussion, therefore, pro
ceed, but along lines of thought
and argument directed at the mer
its and demerits of the said con
stitutional amendment.
ONLY FIRM TO ADVERTISE
AT FAIR IS SATISFIED
R. Mornhlinveg & Son Get Splendid
Results from Their Advertis- '
ing Booth at Parish Fair
R. Mornhjnves & Son was the
only Opelousas firm to lease a booth
at the recent parish fair. This pro
gressive firm has no excuse to of
fer, either, for having placed sev
eral of their articles on exhibition
at the fair. On the contrary Mr.
L. H. Mornhinveg, junior member
of the 'firm, enthusiastically ad
mits -that he could not have ex
hibited the Columbia graphonola,
for which R. Mornhinveg are
agents, to such an advantage and to
so many people in two years, right
in his store.
The promoters of the St. Landry
fair certainly hopethat other pro
gressive merchants will emulate
the e~kample of R. Mornhinveg &
Son. and that at the next annual
parish fair, every merchant in
this city will have a creditable
booth.

EDWARD P. VEAZIE
Edward P. Veazie one of the best
known lawyers i Louisiana, long
recognized as a leading criminal
attorney, expired, after a long ill
ness, on Thursdaf' afternoon at 3
o'clock. Mr. Veazle had been a suf
ferer for sometime and the end, al
thougi it came as a shock was not I
a surprise.
Mr. Veazie, soon after launching
in the practice of h~is profession,
attained fame as a criminal lawyer.
Throughout Louisiani and in many
states of the South, his ability was
recognized. During the time that
he practiced his' profession Mr.
teazie was oh every important case d
tried at t'he Opelousas bar, and was e
often called into distant parishes t
to save some one from and send
others to the gallows.
The funeral took place from the
family residence on Friday after- 1
noon at 3:30 o'clock. Services and
interment at the Catholic Church
and cemetery.
Mrs. R. Lee Wiggins, wife of the I
sheriff of Evangeline, and a former
resident of Opelousas, was among i
the prominent visitors to Opelousas

BIG CIRCUS DAY "-
- DRAWS NEARER
Unusual Amount of Local Interest
Centered on Coming of Bar
num & Bailey
The day of all days in the calen
dar of the small boy has almost
arrived and the youngsters of this
vicinity are anxiously counting the
hours until circus day. It looks
w as though a large percentage
of the local population, both young
and old, will be present at one of
the performances when the Bar
num & Bailey Greatest Show on
Earth exhibits in Alexandria on
Oct. 20.
Not in several years has so much
local interest been evinced in -a,
circus event as has been displayed
this season in the coming exhibi
tion of the Barnum & Bailey Cir
cus. It is promised that the show
will display more new and novel
features than ever before, includ
i ing 100 new acts from Europe.
The principal feature is the new
Oriental, spectacular pageant,
"Persia, or the Pageants of The
Thousand and One Nights." This
great display, which is portrayed by.
1,350 persons, and hundreds of
horses, elephants and camels, de
picts in pageantry the famous tales
of the Arabian Nights. In New
York City, where this pageant was
uroduced for the first time this
Spring. it was announced the most
gorgeous and stupendous Oriental
display ever presented in America.
. Among the foreign circus nov
elties to be seen for the first time
this season are four troupes of
wonderful Chinese performers di
rect from Pekin, the Great Hane
ford family of riders: Signor Bag
onshi, famous dwarf eauestrian
from Ttaly: James Teddy. champion
iumper of the world: Pallenberg's
two trounes of trained bears, and
a host of other novel acts too nu
mei'ous to mention individually.
The Barnum & Bailey circus is
traveoline this season on five trains,
mande un of 9 cars. More than
1.400 poersons are carried in the va
rious donartments of this great
show. which also included an en
lrgpd menagerie of 108 cages and
41 elephants.
A hrilliant new,. three mile street
ner¬.d will be given on the streets
dnrin'. tue morninr hours preced
ing the first performance.

Melisa Spurlock Foster, widow of
the late Dr. D. W. Foster, died at
the residence of her son, Dr. Paul
Foster, near Lawtell, at 9:15, Sept.
29, aged 79 years, 7 months and 21
days. The funeral bortege left
Plaquemine Ridge Saturday the
'30th at i P. M. and arrived at the
Methodist Church in this town at
3 o'clock where the funeral ser
vices was conducted by Rev. Mr."
Harper, who spoke feelingly of the
christian virt4as of the deceased,
when interment followed in the
Protes ;t ry, fo llowed by
many an.d relatives of the
family,
Melisa Spurl k was born. in
1837. Married Dr. D. W. Foster in
1848; soon thereafter they moved to
Avoyelles Parish, La, where they
lived a few years before moving to
St. Landry, where they spent the'
rem'ainlder of their lives rearing a
family of six children. Dr. Paul ;

In the loss of this venerable lady
the community loses one of the
grandest christian characters in
the Attakapas country, a true wife,
a fond mother, a christian neigh
bor, whose devotion to her religion
was not a mere lip service, but
traislated into daily service that
lasted ~not for a day, week, month
or year, but all her life..If her ser
vice to her childred and kindred
may be measured b~ her service to
those who had no particular claim
save the common sisterhood of man.
then indeed it was immeasurable;
no inconvenience, no danger nor
fear of contagion could daunt this
n~oble womain from earrying her
ministration to the sick and needy;
unostentatious, kind, never a frown
but always an encouraging smile,
her gentle ministration carried joy
and comfort to the stricken bed
side and many. a home outside
those of her immediate family will
miss the ministration. In a few
more months she would have
reached te alotted three score
years and tenaccorded to human
existense; it therefore may have
been in the divine order of things
that a life so useful should be re
moved. The ways of providence.are
inscrutable and beyond human ken;
there is doubtless a purpose and
not a mere chance when a. saintly
character takes the last journey to
another world; the loss is niot the
emigrant's, but'those who remain to
mourn; it is to them that the sym
pathy of the enfire community
goes Time alone can mitigate the
changed relation; the departure
will accentuate the virtues of- the
departed. It is at least some little
consolation to know that-death was
not premature and that it came
gently as a ripened autumn leaf
falling on the bosom of Mother

At going out, we thlink and eatr
straight
Another golden chamberi f th
-King'e
Llarger than this we leaie, A
lovelier.
And then in shadowy glimpses
disconnect, . '
The story flower-like, clses its
leaves.
The Will of God is all in tllI. 4:i
Maskes,
Destroys, remakes, for Ni. ow
pleasure, All."
