large part responsible for the peaceful

BROKEf
MAY HAVE MILITARY COMPANY-
Report Bennington Is, to Again Be
Represented In National Guard.
Some of the Bennington young men
who have arrived at their homes af
ter being mustered out of the service
bring the report that Bennington is
likely to again be represented in the
Vermont national guard.
Nothing definite has come from head
quarters, but camp gossip during the
last few days that the troops were at
Port Ethan Allen was to the effect
that a company was to be recruited to
take the place In the guard of com
pany C, the unit which was largely
composed of University of Vermont
students and who have been released
from further service unless they re
enlist. While the recruiting station was in
operation here, 21 young men were sent
to Fort Ethan Allen where they were
constantly drilled for weeks and re
ceived instructions in tactics. In ad
dition several young men from Ben
nington were members of the compan
ies -that took part in the patrol of the
Mexican border.
According to the rumors in circula
tion, it is the plan to secure as many
as possible of these experienced
guardsmen to form the nucleus of the
new company. With such a founda
tion it is the belief that an organiza
tion could be perfected that would
reach and even surpass the excellent
record in the guard made by company
K in years gone by.
HALIFAX MAN SUICIDE
W. E. Wheeler Takes Strychnine in
Wife's Presence.

quantity of the poison which he took
in spite of the desperate efforts of his
wife Dr. A. J. Thomas of Jackson
ville was summoned, but Mr. Wheeler
was dead before he arrived. Mr.
Wheeler was subpeet to attacks of
nervousness and it Is thought that his
mind might have bevn affected.
He was a native of Grove and bad
always lived there, exrept a few years
when he lived in Guilford. His barn
burned last fall after all his crops
had hem hat vested, but the stock
was saved. He was a man of thrift

MUST NOT SINK NEUTRALS
German Submarine Commanders Have
Implicit Instructions.
The Hague. Oct. 14 The Dutch
government received yesterday from
the German hagation a statement to
the effect that implicit instructions
had been, given to the commanders of
German submarines to sink neutral
steamships in no case unless the ves
sels could be destroyed in accordance
with the German prize law. Therefore-,
it was considered extremely un
likely that the captain ot the Bloom
ersdijk was told by the captain of the
submarine which sank the steamship
that he would send to the bottom
every ship which otherwise might
touch a British port. Such a state
ment, it was pointed out at The Hague
would have been completely opposed
to t lie orders given to the commander.
The government also was informed
that should it be proved tut Bloomers
dijk's sinking was not in accordance
with German prize law, Germany
would grant indemnity for the. vessel
and cargo without submlttnig the mat
ter to a German prize court.
