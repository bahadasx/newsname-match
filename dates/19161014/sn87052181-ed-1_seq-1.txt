SOLVES A MYSTERY

fuso about nineteen feet long and at
tached tho cap to a stick of dynamite,
which ho placed in the powder house.

long, Cossins calculated they would
burn at tho rate of an inch a minute,
ho says. That would havo given him

sions occured, however, when he was
still a quarter of a mile from his

they looked at tho ruins of the crusher
and the powder house.

Legends of the Immense Wealth Tken

Early Conquerorn.

fuel nnd fable nre fiisclnutlngly inter
woven in tho accounts of Its vast min
eral wealth. suys Urn geography bul
letin Issued from Washington by the
National (loogniphli: society. Even tho
name Sonoru Is said by some histo
rians to be derived from n peculiarly
musical nnd "sonorous" quality pos
sessed by certain marbles quarried In
the state.
Within n decade lifter Cortez laud
ed on Mexican Mill and conquered the
followers of Montezuma, the Spaniards
had launched expeditions by sea nnd
started exploration parties over the
mountains to llud that region which
two centuries before, nccordlnj; to tra
dition, had supplied the Aztecs wltli
great stores of gold and silver when
they passed through the land In their
tribal migration to the vale of Ann
huiie. By irillO Almlndez Chlrlnos had
proceeded up the coast ns fur as
the mouth of tho Ynqui river, und hu
wns followed by De Vncn, who
brought back a report that gold mid
sliver could bo plucked from tho
ground in unbelievable quantities'. Ono
of De Vncu's followers was .Sebastian,
a mulatto who had n remarkable gift
of Imagination. Among the places ho
".-aw" wero the Seven Cities of Ci
bola, ruled by King Tatarax, whoso
wonderful hejeweled robes duzzled the
eye as ho worshiped each morning in
his magnificent pulnco before n golden
cross. Mermaids also ligured In Se
bastian's narrative ns alluring mar
vels of the Sonora coast.
Among tho Sonora mines about
which romance und reality are strange
ly mingled Is that of Senor Almada
of Qulntern. The owner Is said to
have celebrated the marriage of his fa
vorite daughter by . paneling tho
brldnl chamber with sliver, and pav
ing tho road from his home to tho
church with bars of tho precious
metal.
The legend concerning tho Donu
Mnrln mine Is that its owner, the wid
ow of a Spaniard, De Rodrlques, la
bored for years saving nuggets of gold
until sho had u treasury which re
quired a caravan of 40 mules to convey
tho four tons of precious metal to Mex
ico City. It was a long and arduous
Journey, nnd the widow was constant
ly in fear of being robbed. When sho
finally reached tho capital she would
not rest content until tho fortune had
been placed In tho safekeeping of the
Spanish viceroy. A few days later tho
widow disappeared, and the vast store
of gold wns appropriated by tho gov
ernment treasury and that treasury's
custodian.
An equally pathetic story Is told ot
the Planchas do Plata (Silver Plates)
mine, which, according to Jesuit ac
counts, wns discovered by a Ynqul In
dian during the first half of tho eight
eenth century. From u deep canyon
tho Jesuits are said to have taken
great globules of silver ore, weigh
ing from 20 to .10 pounds. One mam
moth nugget of pure silver, weighing
n quarter ot n ton, was dlscoverd, and
proved the undoing of both tho priests
nnd the Indians. This treasure rock
was with great difficulty loaded be
tween two pack mules nnd taken to
the capital, where It was seized for
tho crown. After years of litigation
tlie authorities decided that not only
this nugget, but iill other ore from tho
canyon belonged to the state. Where
upon Jesuits and Indians couspited
successfully to "lose" the mine.

Substitute for Gold.
A substitute for gold Is obtained by
combining !)l parts of copper with 0
