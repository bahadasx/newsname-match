BABY IN ARMS
WOMAN FOUND
ALONE IN BRUSH
"Mystery Woman" in Torn and
Tattered Mrs. Barkley.
Days and Merits Spent in Creek
Bottom Sear City.
SHE WAS WASTED AND WEAK
But Babe, Bright and Smiling,
M as Well "ursed.
Surrounded and Captured Near
Industrial School.
With a nursing baby Kir! in her
arms, her clothing torn to tatters, her
shoes worn until her heels were on
the ground. Lizzie Barkley, another
"mystery woman." wandered around
thru the weeds and brush along Sol
dier creek until surrounded and cap
tured by persons at the State Indus
trial school. She was held lor county
officers and is now in the county jail.
No one knows where the woman
and baby came from, where she was
trying to fin, nor who she is more
than is indicated by the bare name.
No one knows how many days she
spent with the child in the timber
and brush north of town. The woman
is plainly demented now. but whether
it i. due to the exposure and hardship
.she endured with the baby is not
known.
Took Care of Baby.
There is one point upon which the
woman shows no sign of insanity
her baby. Undoubtedly she went hun
srv while wandering in the timber.
Her form Is wasted and she is weak.
Hut not so the baby. It is well nur
tured. .-;he has looked after .ts wants
as carefully as if in a home. She
kept it well fed and in some manner
kept it warm. It did not even catch"
cold. She spends her entire time in
jail fussinp with the baby.
Friday night Mrs. S. H. Abbott,
matron of the county jail, took the
child uptown to gel it a pair of baby
shoes. The mother was loath to let
it go and other prisoners say she stood
at a window watching every- minute
the matron and the baby were gone.
When Mrs. Abbott returned the
mother clasped her child to her breast
a.x a mother would a child rescued
from drowning or some other death.
"I can t find out anything about the
woman," said Mrs. Abbott. "She told
me once she had been married, but
since then I can't get anything from
her. She ought to be transferred to
the detention home where she would
have proper food. The jail diet the
mother is getting is not good for the
baby. It is not so well now as it was
when the mother was brought in."

Fears Greeks Would Be Crushed
if They Join Allies.
London, Oct. 14. The Rumanians
have halted an attempted Austro
German invasion south of the Red
Tower Pass and have driven the Teu
tons back a considerable distance from
the border. Bucharest dispatches to
day reported that General Falken
hayn's advance has been checked ev
erywhere along the southern Transyl
vanian frontier. On the eastern fron
tier, the Germans have been stopped
on the Rumanian northern wing and
thrown back at some points by strong
counter attacks. Elsewhere the Ru
manian resistance is stiffening.
The battles on both allied wings in
the Balkans are again becoming more
violent. The British are at the out
skirts of the city of Seres, already un
der bombardment and have cleared
the surrounding country of the enemy.
On the left wing the Bulgars have
been counter-attacking desperately,
but have been unable to bend back the
Serbian line.
Greek King Fears War.
King Constantine, despite the
growth of the Venizelos movement in
Greece continues to delay plans for
Greece's entry into the war. The king
told a diplomat, according to the Ath
ens correspondent of the Daily Chron
icle, that he was convinced the Ger
mans would overrun Rumania within
fifteen days and that he feared Greece
would meet a like fate if she joined
the allies.

A German submarine on October 4,
the admiralty statement adds, sank

The loss of the Gallia was admitted
by the French admiralty a few days
ago and it was stated that more than
800 men were missing. The French
steamer Rigel, registered at Mar
seilles, is believed to be the "small
French cruiser" mentioned in the Ber
lin statement.

X-RAY CAUSESCANCER
Physician Seeking Cure for Disease
Contracts It From Burn.
New York, Oct. 14. After nineteen
years study of the effect of the X-ray
on cancerous growths. Dr. Francis
Leroy Satterlee, Jr., cousin of Bishop
Henry Yates Satterlee of Washington
and of Herbert L. Satterlee, the latter
of whom is brother-in-law of J. P.
Morgan, may lose his right hand by
the disease for which he hopes some
day to find a cure.
Dr. Satterlee was one of the first
physicians to work on cancer with the
X-ray. In 1897, before the effect of
the ray on flesh was realized, he was
badly burned during an operation.
After rigorous treatment they ap
peared to heal. Later they re-opened
and Dr. Satterlee underwent several
skin grafting operations. Several
days ago his hand pained him. Can
cerous growths were found on one fin
ger. It was removed at the upper
joint. Then it was taken off com
pletely. On Tuesday, Dr. Satterlee will
undergo an operation to determine if
his hand must be taken off.

Boston, Mass., Oct. 14. The Ger

sighted off the Massachusetts coast,
apparently in full pursuit of an un
identified Dutch steamer. The radio
station at the Charlestown Navy Yard
withheld whatever information they
had, but wireless messages from in
bound steamers made the report ap
pear authentic.
Can't Find U-boat Base.
Newport, R. I., Oct. 14. The Ger
man under-sea boat, U-53, which sank
five and possibly six steamships off
Nantucket Shoals last Sunday, had
not been relocated by stations here
early today despite reports from the
steamship Bovic, yesterday, that she
had sighted a submarine "astern" 200
miles east of New York. The location
of the Teuton raider is just as much
of a mystery today as it was imme
diately after she dropped out of sight
following here destructive raid.
No other report regarding the Ger
man submarine save that from the
Bovic is regarded as authentic and
naval authorities here are awaiting
more definite word, which is expected
when the Bovic reaches New York.
American destroyers, at least three
of them from the reserve fleet, still
patrol the heavy seas ff the Atlantic
coast today. No word regarding the
"floating base" for which they are said
to be searching has been received
here. Allied destroyers still cruised
from Cape May to Cape Ann on the
lookout for the German raider.

New York, Oct- 14. When the

parently in pursuit of a Danish pas
senger ship, the Hellig Olav, according
to observers on the deck of the Bovic
which arrived here.
The nationality of the submarine
was not identified. The Bovic in fear
of attack because of being a freight

FLY TO MEET TROOPS
Capt. Billard and Major Rahn May
Aviate to Fort Riley.
Major R. Neil Rahn will accom
pany Capt. Phil Billard in an aero
plane flight from Topeka to Fort
Riley, to greet the Kansas troops on
their return from the border, if a plan
being discussed by the Topeka Com
mercial club materializes. It is all a
question of dollars and cents whethet
Topeka will spend as much money as
the recently goateed aviator wants for
such a flight. It is" believed that Cap
tain Billard will cut the price to some
extent in order that -the Kansas troops
may have the benefit of this strange
greeting at Fort Riley.
Under the plan being formulated.
Captain Billard and Major Rahn will
time their departure from Topeka so
that they will reach Pawnee Flats
about the same time that the hundreds
of Topekans and Kansans in special
trains arrive there. A decision on the
proposition will be made shortly, pos
sibly after the time of the arrival of
the troops is learned definitely.

GAIN INEARNINGS
Increase of $1,706,000 in Two
Months on Santa Fe.
Net Jump in July and August
Over Period of 1915.
Santa Fe net earnings for the first
two months July and August of the
fiscal year of 1916-17, increased
$1,706,727 over the same two months
in 1915, according to official figures
published today by the Railway Age
Gazette. Total net earnings for the
two months from railway operation
amounted to $9,1C1.103.
Eight thousand six -hundred and
forty-eight miles of lines were oper
ated. Freight revenues amounted to
$14,621,392 gross. Passenger reve
nues were $5,063,305. Total gross
revenues, including miscellaneous, to
taled $21,209,367. Maintenance of
ways and structures cost $2,741,168,
while maintenance of equipment cost
$3,171,206. Other expenses were:
Traffic, $369,289; transportation.
$5,405,101; general, $385,249, making
total operating expenses $12,048,264.
Railway tax accruals were $947,280.
The increase is one- of the largest
ever experienced by the railroad. E.
L. Copeland, treasurer of the Santa
Fe. today said it was due to the mam
moth volume of business which the
road, as well as other roads, are doing
this year because of unusual condi
tions. The financial reports of ninety other
railroads for the same two months are
also published. Only five showed a
decrease in earnings from those for
the same two months last year. One
road reported the same net earnings
as last year. One road reported an
operating loss.

Topekans Still Trying to Plan Wel

Owing to the fact that the Kansas
troops en route home from the border

tomorrow, plans that were on foot
for Topeka to send a large delegation
to the fort to welcome the return of
the soldier lads have been indefinitely
postponed, according to a statement
given out by J. Will Kelly, secretary
of the Commercial club today.
However, the plans have not been
entirely given up and if the troops are
not mustered out before tomorrow
week it is very probable that a more
elaborate program will be arranged
than could have been made for to-

Yenus-Llke Model Is Draped

No Pins Used! Crowd So Great
Railing Crashes.
New York, Oct. 14. A great crowd
of men who jammed about one of the
feature exhibits at the Electrical ex
position at Grand Central Palace were
terribly disappointed today. On a
raised platform Miss Grace Marshall
garbed in an entrancing corset cover
and diaphanous petticoat, stood prov
ing to the world that no art of man
could make her look any better. How
ever, she was the model on which silks
from electrically driven looms were to
be draped without the use of pins. So
R. H. Levie went on with his draping.
The crowd grew. By the time Miss
Marshall was completely draped it
grew to alarming proportions.
Every time Levie explained the silk
wasn't pinned on, more men crowded
about, hoping. They hoped so hard
the railing crashed in and firemen had
to be called to drive the crowd away.
Nothing slipped.

EPISCOPALIANS
REJECT DIVORCE
REFORM CANON
Both Clergy and Laymen Ma
jority Opposed It.
Canon Would Prohibit Remar
riage of DiTorcees.
INNOCENT WOULD SUFFER?
Would Drive Men and Women
Out of Church.
Problem Must Be Met With
Present Day Methods.
St. Louis, Mo., Oct. 14. The pro
posed change in the canons of the
Protestant Episcopal church, forbid
ding the re-marriage of persons di
vorced for causes arising after mar
riage, regardless of the cause, was re
jected by the house of deputies of the
general convention today.
The proposed canon failed of adop
tion because of non-concurrence of the
clerical and lay delegates.
The delegates voted by dioceses. The
clerical delegates approved the pro
posed cannon bv a vote of 40 H to
24. The lay delegates rejected by a
vote of 29 affirmative to 32 nega
tive. The rejection of the canon leaves
the present church law unchanged.
Under this law, an Episcopal clergy
man can perform the marriage cere
mony for the innocent party to a di
vorce granted on statutory grounds,
provided the evidence in the case first
has been submitted to the diocesan
bishop and he agrees that the evi
dence was sufficient for the granting
of the divorce.
The fight for the new canon was
led in the house of deputies by Rev.
Leighton Parks of New York. The
opposition was led by Dr. R. H. Mo
Kim of Washington.
Aroused Heated Debate.
St. Louis. Mo., Oct. 14. Discussion
of the proposal to enact a church law
forbidding a clergyman to perform a
re-marriage ceremony regardless of
the question of the supposed "guilt"
or "innocence" of divorced persons,
was resumed at today's session of the
house of deputies of the triennial con
vention of the Protestant Episcopal
church.
The proposed canon, recommended
in the report of a commission ap
pointed at -the last general convention
to study the problem precipitated a
lively debate last Thursday and has
attracted widespread interest in the
church.. Speakers, arguing for its
tJoption generally conceded that no
legislation of the church can put an
end to re-marriage, but asserted that
the proposed law would help the
church to live up to its marriage ser
vice which binds a man and a woman
"until death do us part."
How Can Clergyman Tell?
It was pointed out that the present
canon, providing that clergymen shall
not solemnize a marriage for a di
vorced person unless he or she was the
"innocent" party to the divorce, im
poses a difficult problem on the
clergy, particularly where a divorce is
believed to have Deen obtained by ac
tual collusion. Other deputies urged
the adoption of the proposed canon
would cause the innocent to suffer
with the "guilty" and would drive
Christian men and women forced by
circumstances over which they had no
control to obtain a divorce out of the
church. It was asserted the problem
is one which must be dealt with in
present day methods and not "in the
methods of a century ago."
Visitors to Preach Tomorrow.
Today was reunion and reception
day for most of the auxiliary associa
tions of the church. Following cor
porate communion at Christ church
Cathedral, early this morning, the va
rious associations began their meet
ings. Several of the attending bishops
addressed civic organizations while
others were preparing sermons they
will preach from local pulpits tomor
row. The only session of the confer
ence today was the conference on
theological education by the general
board of religious education. Reports
of various committees of the board
were read at the morning session and
the general discussion of the question
put over until this afternoon.
Ruction Over $9,500 Salary.
There was still much discussion to
day among the bishops and deputies
on the question raised yesterday as to
the $9,500 yearly salary of Bishop
Arthur Selden Lloyd of New York,
head of missions conference. Bishop
Arthur C. A. Hall. Vermont, who was
rebuked for his demand that the sal
ary be reduced, said today he would
not again attempt to introduce the
measure.
The action of Bishop Tuttle of St.
Louis, presiding bishop of the joint
session, in tabling the suggestion was
held proper by most of the members
6f the conference.

in Topeka lor years. Dr. Harding
stated. She has decided to build such
a structure to answer the apparent de
mand. There will be no "rooms" such aa

girls will rent an apartment in which
will be a living room, dining room and
a kitchenette. On the first floor will
be a laundry In which the girls can
