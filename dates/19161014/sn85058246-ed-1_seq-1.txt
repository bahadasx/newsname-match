Speaking of a Prohibition Law
Wilson Policies Versus
His Pre-election Speeches
During tho Democratic campaign
of 1912, President Wilson laid n
great deal of stress upon party plat
forms, saying that a platform was
not "molasses to catch files," not
merely a party declaration to be
forgotten, but a sacred obligation
to be lived up to.
Tho Democratic platform, to
which Mr. Wilson fully subscribed
and upon which ho was elected,
among other things said: "Tho con
stitutional rights of American citi
zens should protect them on our
borders aand go with them through
out the world, and any American
citizen residing or having property
In nny foreign country IS ENTI
TLED TO AND MUST BE GIVEN
THE FULL PROTECTION OF THE
UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT,
BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND HIS
PROPERTY."
SInco tho election of Mr. Wilson,
Americans residing In Mexico, and
having property In Mexico havo been
plundered of their property, have
been tortured, havo been compelled
to seo their I women nnd children
outraged nnd abused, havo them
selves been cruelly murdered, not
by ones and twos, but by tons and
hundreds, nnd though theso outrag
es and assassinations havo gono on
for n period of over three years,
tho GOVERNMENT OF THE UNIT
ED STATES UNDER THE ADMIN
ISTRATION OF WOODROW WIL
SON, HAS IN NO WAY "PROTECT
ED" AMERICAN CITIZENS, NOR
HAS THE SLIOHTEST PUNISH
MENT BEEN INFLICTED BY "THE
UNITED (STATES GOVERNMENT"
UPON THE GUILTY BRIGANDS
WHO HAVE OPENLY COMMITTED
THESE ROBBERIES, OUTRAGES
AND MURDERS.
According t Mr. Wilson's method
of fulfillment tho abovo should have
read:
"Tho constitutional rights of
American Citizens should not pro
tect them on our borders and shall
not go with them throughout the
residing or having property In any
foreign country IS NOT ENTITLED
TO AND MUST NOT BE GIVEN
PROTECTION WHATSOEVER ON
THE PART OF THE UNITED
STATES FOR HIMSELF OR HIS
PROPERTY."
Mr. Wilson is a Historian. It
would bo woll for him to turn tho
pages of history nnd refresh his
momory on somo of the struggles
Incident to tho early settlement of
A NEW MOVEMENT
STARTED BY TAX
PAYERUEAGUE
At a meeting of tho committeo
of tho Taxpayors' Leaguo hold on
October 12. certain resolutions wero
ndoptcd which thoy desire to submit

n mnss meeting Is horoby called to
moot nt tho county court houso In

this country. One Incident In parti
cular ho ought to recall and that Is
when two Frenchmen, LaFnyetto
and DoKalb cast anchor near
Charleston, stepped from tho Vlc
ory on American soil, clasped each
ithers hand nnd looKing up to the
stars vowed that they would con
quoor Tor Liberty or die on foreign
"so". '
In those days of true patriotism,
foreigners could not risk their
lives for the American causo. In
theso days of "Watchful Waiting"
tindor President Wilson, oven Amcrl
cans' must clotho themselves In
llrltlsh ratnme'ht In order to bo as
sured protection on Mexican coil.
It would also be woll for Mr.
Wilson to study theso patriotic
Wolds of his opponent, Charles
Evan Hughes. "Wo do not propose
to tolerate nny Improper Interfer
ence with American property, with
"American malls, or with llgttlmato
Commercial Intercourse."
r
"No American who lh exercising
only American rights shall be put
on any Blacklist by any foreign na
tion." Or it would be well for him to
tako homo to himself tho following
America, npatrlotlc words of ono of
our own citizens. President Jos. F.
Smith.
"I, somehow, havo a feeling In my
heart that the glorious republic of
the United States, of which wo aro
clttlzens loyal nnd true, has a glor
ious destiny to perform and to reach
and that glorious destiny Is to ex
tend liberty to tho oppressed nnd,
as 'far as It Is possible, unto all
nations anu unto all people.
"After hearing tho romarks of
President Pratt, with referenco to
tile condition of our peoplo nnd to
tho down-trodden and oppressed
peoplo of Mexico, thirteen millions
of whom are held under serfdom
and slavery by the descendants of
their conquerors, who could not
wish devoutly, "with all their hoarts,
that 'somo mighty power, somo Just
power but some power that was
equal to tho task, should extend tho
hand of freedom to those oppressed
peoplo, oven If It costs tho lives of
their oppressors. That Is my
scntlmont.
"I do not want war; but tho
Lord has said it shall bo poured out
upon all nations, and If we escapo It
will be 'by skin of our teeth'; and I
would rather kill tho oppressor than
to allow tho oppressor to kill tho Innocent."

SPEAKING OF A
PROHIBITION LAW
Prohibition is no longer a political
iuc in Utah. Both parties lia'cde
clarcd in favor of it by legislature
enactment without any constitution
al amendment. Whichever party is
successful at the polls next month,
it is certain that the legislature
which convenes next January will
enact a statewide prohibition law.
But just how sweeping the prov
isions of that law will he is going to
depend upon the political complex
ion of the legislature, and of the gov
ernor of this state.
If the legislature and governor is
republican, the bill enacted and
signed will be such as to afford little
comfort to the antis, and the en
forcement of such a law under the
administration of such an anient ad
vocate of prohibition as Nephi L.
Morris will be beyond criticism.
No one lias ever doubted where
Nephi L. Morris stands, and has
ever stood upon this question. His
whole life has been devoted to an
advocacy of the suprcssiou of the
liquor traffic.
On the other hand Simon Bam
berger has been for years directly
or indirectly connected with enter
prises which have had for their ob
ject tlie making of money out of the
sale of liquor, and while he person
ally asserts 'that he is as good a pro
hibitionist as there is anywhere,
still witli a democratic legislature
and a democratic governor there is
less likelihood, by reason of such
connection, of as complete and
sweeping legislation being passed as
with a republican legislature.
And what about the enforcement of
a prohibition law under a Democratic
governor? Do you feel that the sym
pathies of Simon Bamberger, if elec
ted, arc going to be with such en
forcement, or will there still be ling
ering feeling for the people with
whom he was once associated?
