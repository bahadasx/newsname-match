The Cane Crop.
The exceptionally cool weather1
we have reported during the past
several weeks has been interrupted.
by warmer temperatures and some
rainfall during the past few da,,.
but the forecast at this writing isI
for .older weather, and the rain '
that has occured has unot been suf-1
Ecent to give the planters what
tlhey need to fit the soil for fall
planting. A number of planters
are refraining from fallplanting un- :

It Is Time to Begin to get
Ready for a Better Parish
Fair Next October\
M" T. H CASANOVA
The Fair spirit is g.u:ning head
way in this parish and though
-oi:tle of us have done lot' of work
to c.nrr out the Fair program we
are thinking about plans for a
liarger and I ette'r P'arish Fair next
fall. Each of the larger towns in
thc porishl oui;t to ;ive sonic kind
Uot C u(nit llltIiit\ fair 111 cOlnl ctt1,iin
with the school \:,ark and then he
ready' for getting th Iir ex hiiits to
the ptrish lair. It takes Fairs,
c .it;el at.on and COn:i tition to
bitild a country and w\ith the sup
port of everv indilidual in this
section bo, th farmer and busi:ness
men \\e can put up a parish exhibit
that will be of credit to any parish.
As an individual you can do
ntmuch toward the accomplishment
of l neicfit, to the rural cntmniLni
t:es in i lch Von are lixing. ''h t,.

,f farmer.. Fifty ,h:. it c).i .
a bale it cotton aioml twenty lag.s of
ice with pure bred hlgs m;Id cattle
are a few of the inm ovements that
could he on every farm and vot
catn play a promiinenlt part in getting
there things to come to pass. With
getter farming conditions of the
farming people the towlns and
schools and roads are going to be
implroved and until these conditions
are worked toward there will be
few funds for public improvements.
Cooperation of ee, v farmer to
ward the holding each year of a
free parrh fair where each in
dividual can comnpete without cost
with his neighbor and ,\ ithout fees
observe all departments of the fair I
will do wonders toward getting
these results
Every individual in the parish i
can Ret ready for the Parish Fairl
rext fall an:d expect to have ac
better exhibit than ever before
Begin to get ready now by saving t
seed corn for a better patch, of corn
a good calf, colt, or anything that
will help to put Vermilion in a
place with the more progressive
parishes in the state.

* BY T. If. CASANOVA t
The Vermilion Parish Fair as
held on the 5, 6, 7 and 8 was
largely attended each day by
farmers from all parts of the parish
and visitors from our neighhor
parishes.
In spite of the harvest season in
parts of the parish there were 21
club boys with exhibits at the
Parish Fair,.
The agent expects to send in :
Weekly W\ants and Offerings to
the Conuni~sioner of Agriculture:
and also have same pnlhlished in
Parish Papers. Farmers having
thiUngs for sale, or wants mnay send
list to Agent at Abheville.
Don't forget to plant a few acres
of oats ,before. it gets too late as
there is inothing better for the
chickens and stock during the i
winter.
