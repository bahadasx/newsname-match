".Many strcots In tho congested
neighborhoods of our city nro used ns
playgrounds for tho children," says
Aid. Merrlom's stntoment. "This Is
especially truo In tho Immediate vi
cinity of n public school. Tho coming
of business establishments and fac
tories into such neighborhoods In
variably brings moro nnd heavier vo
hlclos and Increases tho danger to tho
children from accidents.
"Tho numbor of children killed
while playing on Chicago streets Is
appalling. If wo nro to mako our
strcots snfo for our children nnd ro
ducc tho numbor of llttlo ones who

fares of Chlcngo, wo must sogregnto
our factories and our shops nnd our
stores and keep thorn away from our
homos. Ruslness nnd Industrial neigh
borhoods must bo kept soparnto from
residential districts.
"In addition to a much desired re
duction In deaths and Injuries to chil
dren and grown people, tho creation
of business, factory and homo zones
would bring about othor Important
benefits. It will protect against de
preciation of property values both tho
home ownor and tho investor. It
would matcrlaly lesson flro hazards
nnd bring smaller Insurance rates. It
would add to tho enjoyment of our
homo life by ridding tho places whoro
