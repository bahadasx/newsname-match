Asks Support in Maintenance of De
partment and Makes Many Timely
Suggestions for Preservation
of Game
WANTS CHANGE IN SEASONS
Chloride, Arizona,
October 9, 1916
Editor Chloride Herald,
Chloride, Arizona.
Dear Sir:
In view of the abundance of news,
facts and figures now being brought
"before your readers with reference to
our government, state and national,
it may seem presumptious to offer any
information concerning so small a de
partment of the state as the Game
Warden office. However, we venture
these few points in the hope that they
may not be uninteresting to your
readers.
Means of Support
The Game Warden's activities de
pend for support upon the sale of
licenses and fines collected, the state
warden's salary, traveling and office
expenses being the only items coming
from the general tax fund.
Ought not every person, who enjoys
game and song birds be willing to
contribute "four bits" for a yearly
license to hunt and fish, when all of
the money so collected goes for the
protection of his interests? And is
this not especially true when the men
who look after his interests must be
laid off as soon as sportsmen quit
buying licenses.
Some things we are trying to do:
1. Enforce our present laws so as
to preserve the game birds and
animals we now have.
2. Get some changes in seasons
and license fees which will do a great
deal for the increase of our present
game supply.
3. Propogate bob white quail,
Chiese pheasants, wild turkeys and
elk.
4. Locate a federal fish hatchery in
Arizona for stockinfi northern
streams and lakes, as well as ponds
built by ranchers.
5. Teach the school children of the
state the reasons for protecting wild
life.
6. By impartial and reasonable
punishments of offenses, to obtain the
cooperation of every citizen of every
community.
Something to Think About
1. Arizona game supply is an asset
in the number of tourists it brings
here to hunt it; in the money brought
into the state by its sale, for propogat
ing purposees, to other state game
brought $1.50 each, and quail $12.00
per dozen), and it is most valuable as
an asset in the pleasure it affords our
own people.
2. If you're going to have game
about you, you must help protect it.
License Fees
For each general license to resi
dents, 50 cents.
, For each big game license, non
residents, $25.00.
For each big game license, alien,
$100.00.
For each bird license, non-resident,
$10.00.
For each bird license, alien, $25.00,
For each permit to transport out of
state, deer or turkey, each, $2.00.
For each duplicate license or per
mit, 10 cents.
Season
1. Male deer, and turkey from
October 1, to December 15. Chloride

CONTINUE SACKING ORE
ON THE BLACKJACK
The Blackjack people have started
a new tunnel to tap the vein at a
depth of 450 feet. They still continue
to sack ore for shipment. A con
tract has been let to build a road
from the mouth of Alum wash to the
property. The ore from this estate
will be handled by trucks.
BLUE BIRD WILL
INSTALL BIG PUMP
From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
Manager A. G. Keating of the Blue
Bird stated yesterday that as soon as
adequate pumping machinery can be
installed sinking will be resumed.
The Blue Bird closed down some time
ago on account of the large amount
of water encountered in the shaft at
a depth of 230 feet. A small pump
ing plant was in operation at the
time but it was of too small capacity
to handle the flow.
A new and much larger plant is to
be installed. It is expected that it
will be in operation within a month.
The old plant is being taken out and
all will be in readiness for the in
stallation of the new plant when it
arrives.
A new and larger compressor will
also be installed. It will be of suffi
cient capacity to furnish the motive
power for the pumping plant and air
drills.
The Blue Bird is controlled by the
Big Jim people. Its location is about
3000 feet northwest of the United
Eastern, and on what is known as
the main vein of the proven ore bear
ing formation of the central part of
the district. The company is said
to be well financed, and Manager
Keating states that the shaft will be
sunk to a depth of 400 feet with all
possible speed. At that depth cross
cuts will be run to the vein. The
vein can easily be traced on the sur
face to Blue Bird through the United
Eastern, Tom Reed and Big Jim
properties.
SECOND BIGH STRIKE
IN THE WEAVER DIST.
Another rich strike of high grade
ore is reported from the Weaver dis
trict. This time it is gold ore on the
property owned by Fred Fulham. The
claims were only recently located.
This district is contiguous to Chloride
and is coming to th& front rapidly,
being in the same district as the Tidal
Wave and the new copper strike.
B
From Friday's Dally Miner
Backing his car into the big excava
tion at the corner of Fourth street and
the alley, between Front and Beale
streets, last evening, W. H. Rivers had
a narrow escape from being killed.
Moving backward from the curb in
front of Bonelli's store, the auto ob
tained such speed that Mr. Rivers was
unable to control it and it went over
the high embankment. Luckily, it fell
right side up. One of the tires blew
up with a loud report, which attracted
many people to the scene.
Mr. Rivers was found unhurt in the
car, although somewhat shaken by the
fall. Some planks were laid into the
excavation and a crowd pulled the au
tomobile back onto the street. An ex
amination disclosed no injury to the
machine, aside from the ruined tire.
The automobile, a Buick, was a recent
purchase, and Mr. Rivers had not got
ten acquainted with the workings of
the "reverse."
CARLOAD OF OVERLANDS
The Perry Overland company re
ports the arrival of a carload of Over-
lands. Deliveries will be made with-
ing a day or two to persons who have
already placed orders.
BUYS PEERLESS
Manager Franklin of the Arizona
Engineering company reported the
sale yesterday of a Peerless car to
Norman Strachan.
UNITED IN WEDLOCK
P. W. Chase and Miss Agnes Fisher
from Thumb Butte mine were quietly
married by Judge Cohenour in King
man Monday, October 2. Frank
Chase, a brother of the groom, and
Mrs. J. Pepper witnessed the cere
mony. The couple will make their
fhome in Kingman.
FIRE DEPARTMENT
E SAT.
(From Oatman Section Daily Miner.)
The fire department members are
preparing to do themselves proud at
the dance which they will give at the
Star Theatre next Saturday evening.
Everything is now in readiness and
the sale of tickets is well underway.
The boys state that they are meeting
with ready response by the public in
the sale of tickets.
The firemen will give the dance to
raise funds to pay for the recently
installed fire bell and equipment. The
management of the Star Theatre has
donated the hall and music for the
affair. With this large expense lifted
the firemen are jubilant over the out
look of the financial success of the
event.
STORE OF LOCAL
From Thursday's Dally Miner
The recent improvements at Nickell
and company's dry goods store places
that establishment on a plane with the
very best of stores in towns many
times the size of Kingman. The new
front is now furnished. The show
windows have been neatly lettered and
they will soon be trimmed for a fall
opening, an announcement of which
will soon appear in the Daily Miner.
In addition to the new front an
up-to-date six basket parcel and cash
carrier system has been installed.
This will give just as good service
in' checking sales and making change
as those used in similar stores in the
laree cities. A splendid display of
new fall goods and millinery will be
made at the fall opening.
READ! AUTO TRAVEL
IS BOUND WEST
Some idea of the number of auto
mobiles traveling westward at this
season may be gained from the fact
that the garage at Seligman sells an
average of 1000 gallons of gasoline
daily, nearly all of which is sold to
parties overland bound.
The Arizona route is becoming the
most favored of all overland routes,
and this is due in a large measure to
the progressive policy of the present
administration in providing good
roads. Since Governor Hunt adopted
his humane treatment of state con
victs over 200 miles of statt high
way has been constructed. This work
is of the best and will endure ior all
time. It constitutes practically a
boulevard whose fame is spreading
throughout the nation.
Tn addition this class of labor has
constructed culverts which, if placed
side by side, would measure a total
of five miles, or, approimately, 26,000
linear feet. And this does not tell
the story. Many miles of other roads
have been improved and many bridges
snan streams, making travel possible
where it would have been impossible
but for Governor Hunt's intelligent,
progressive and humane policies.
AUTO SALES
The Arizona Stores company reports
the sale of a six-cylinder Buick to A.
J. Curtis of Chloride and a Buick
"four" to W. H. Rivers of the George
A. Bonelli store.
LEAVE FOR COAST
G. R. Franklin, manager of the
Arizona Engineering company left
yesterday for Los Angeles by auto
mobile, accompanied by D. P. Bates.
They will each drive back a new
Paige Detroit. One of the new cars
has already been sold.
HELD FOR TRIAL
Jack Brock was arrested yesterday
on a charge of illegally selling whisky
'and was bound over to the Superior
Court, bail in the sum of $400 being
taken. It is said that there are two
detectives in Kinjman investigating
the illegal traffic in booze and that
there may be many more arrests.
BIG JIM TO BUILD
ILL, CAMP TALK
From Oatman Section Dally Miner.
At the Big Jim drifting on the vein
and blocking out ore continues. The
vein is opened up for a distance of
500 feet. Manager A. G. Keating
states that exploration of the vein
and blocking out of the ore will be
continued for some time before sink
ing to a greater depth is undertaken.
At present operations are being con
fined to the 400 and 485 foot levels.
For a time water seriously hampered
operations on these levels but the
recently installed pumping plant is
handling it in a very satisafctory man
ner. That a mill will soon be erected at
the Big Jim is common talk among
mining men here who are seemingly
conversant with the future plans of
the Big Jim. It is said that a plant
larger than that now being erected
at the United Eastern is planned.
An estimate of the amount of ore
now blocked out is difficult to take
but it is said that it will run into
the millions. Manager Keating stated
yesterday that he has not estimated
the value of ore in sight but that it
wjll run into large figures.
E
The Towne management is prepar
ing to equip the mine with a new
gallows frame, hoist and compressor.
The property will be shut down until
the arrival of the machinery which
should be here in a few weeks. After
the latter is installed a new shaft
will be sunk.
f- The old workings of this property
were in such a delapldated shape that
a new shaft was Imperative. In the
old workings considerable high grade
was encountered and the mine in gen
eral looks so promising that S. S.
Jones, one of the principal owners is
highly pleased with the prospects.
S
From Friday's Daily Miner
The crosscut on the 300-foot level of
the Keystone mine, at Mineral Park,
has cut through eight feet of ore that
is said to have an average value of
better than $200 per ton in gold and
silver. Drifting along the vein shows
a continuance of high values, and the
management believes one of the great
est bodies of ore ever opened in the
camp is being developed.
The ore shows ruby silver and gold.
Some copper is coming in, and the im
pression prevails that greater depth
will bring to light heavy copper val
ues. The management of the property
is rushing work, and as soon as de
velopment work has been carried along
the present level to thoroughly ex
plore the new vein another lift will be
sunk.
EXCAVATING FOR NEW MILL
Excavating for the reservoir on the
Copper Age property started Tues
day. This is the preliminary work in
the construction of the new mill which
will be erected by G. W. Peer. The
mill will be in operation by Feb
ruary 1.
USING SPECIAL CAR
A special car on the Santa Fe was
sidetracked here Tuesday and waited
for a party of about fifteen people,
headed by G. R. Stone, who left the
train at Topock and made a tour
through the Goldroad and Oatman dis
trict. The party left on train No. 10
yesterday for the east and was
scheduled for a stop at Grand Canyon
and other points.
RETURNS FROM COAST
H. C. Snow returned yesterday from
the coast where he has been on busi
ness for the past week. He states
that coast people are talking about
Oatman. Mr. Snow is of the opinion
that the influx of people will be so
great into Oatman after the election
that it will be next to impossible to
take care of them.
WILL EQUIP THETOWN
BANQUET
From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
The first annual banquet of Local
Union No. 1175, United Brotherhood
of Carpenters and Joiners of America,
at Miners Union hall, Tuesday even
ing, was the most largely attended
affair ever given in Oatman. Presi
dent Moore, as toastmaster, delivered
an address of welcome to the members
of the local, their wives and families
and invited guests.
The first number of the musical
program rendered was a piano solo
by Professor Waters, which with other
selections rendered by him during the
evening, was highly appreciated by
the large audience. The second num
ber was a song, "In the Cradle of the
Deep" by Miss Hovey, who possesses
a splendid voice and charming per
sonality. Her songs were the princi
pal feature of the evening's intertain-
ment.
An address by Fred S. McCullough,
business agent of the local, was highly
educational along the organization
and historical lines of unions. Mr.
McCullough has been a member of
the Brotherhood since 1883 and his
many experiences, as related by him,
were highly interesting.
Mr. Collins of the Retail Clerks'
Union, made an interesting and amus
ing talk. Mr. Collins has traveled
extensively in South America and his
explanation of the contrasts between
that country and the United States
was highly appreciated.
H. M. Bell rendered two recitations
in a pleasing fashion. Mr. Brown
also gave a recitation, which won ap
plause. After the rendition of the musical
program a repast of sandwiches, cake
and coffee was served. The food was
cooked by the wives of the carpenters
and it is needless to say all present
highly appreciated it.
Great credit is due Messrs Sh raver-
sand, Mathews and Fritz, composing
the committee which arranged the
banquet.

INJURED WHILE ROPING
BRONCHO NEAR RED LAKE
From Thursday's Daily Miner
The Daily Miner yesterday morning
reported an accident sustained by
Frank Kayser, while roping a broncho
in Wallapai valley the day before.
Kayser and Ralph Bulkely drove their
auto into a band of wild horses near
Red Lake and in a spirit of mischief
roped one of the animals. As the
animal was thrown Kayser jumped
from the running board of the car,
but misjudged the speed at which it
was running, and was thrown violent
ly to the ground, sustaining a fracture
of the bones of one leg. He was
brought to town and the fracture re
duced. He is gettVflg, along nicely.

P BOOTLEGGERS
I From Oatman Section Daily Miner.
i Wednesdav was "movincr dav" in
Oatman for bootleggers. Warrants
were issued in wholesale quantities
but the officers served but four of
them owing to the fact that "a word
of warning" was passed around and
those of the profession who were not
campelled by other interests to remain
in Oatman "beat it" to a more healthy
region.
Eighteen or more warrants were is
sued. Fourteen of them are still in
the possession of the officers, owing to
the disappearance of the parties for
whom they were issued. It was prac
tically impossible to assertain who
was responsible for the issuance of
the warrants. It was stated, however,
that those issued for parties who were
doing business on ground owned by
the Tom Reed Mining company, were
sworn to by attorneys of that com
pany, but this statement could not
be verified last night. Others, it is
said, were sworn to by citizens of
Oatman who issued a warning through
a local news paper some time ago.
All efforts o ascertain from the offi
cers who was responsible for the war
rants failed, but it is likely that this
matter will be cleared up today when
those arrested persons will appear in
court for hearings.
After the word went out that a
raid was to be made by officers, Oat
man was the dryest town in the state.
Nothing stronger than lemonade was
for sale. And it is likely that boot
legging in Oatman in the future will
be in the nature of the individual who
carries a single bottle in his pocket
and collects in advance. This class
of bootlegger is the worst type, as
his wares are of the lowest quality.
Generally his "Old Taylor" is pure
wood alcohol and gasoline of equal
quantities. Others who are desirious
of selling something that has a harder
"kick" include with .the above mix
ture an ample portion of ether. And
beer will be out of the question.
One result of the absence of the
"legitimate" bootlegger will favor the
auto drivers as they are certain to
have many more passengers going and
coming from Needles. People who
drink will go to California to get the
liquor, and they will return with large
quantities for personal use.
From one source of information it
was learned that the business of boot
legging would only be temporarily
discontinued, and that in another week
the fraternity would again be in its
glory. However, parties who are said
to be responsible for the sudden stop
page of the business are insistent
that it shall not be again permitted.
DESERT P 8 W. CO.
RUSH CHLORIDE LINE
The Desert Power & Water com
pany is rushing its line across the
desert toward Chloride as fast as men
and money can push construction. It
is now believed that Chloride will
have electric lights within three
weeks. The transformation that will
be effected will be wonderful, as the
thriving camp has been neglected woe
fully in this respect Chloride Her
ald.
Chloride received a visit Tuesday
from R .C. Saufley, vice president and
treasurer of the Chloride Queen Min
ing company. Mr. Saufley, with a
number of Phoenix business men, are
financing this ocmpany, which owns
the Sunday School group.
A force of men will be put to work
at once and the property developed to
depth. The officers of the company
are Henry Mitchell, president; J. M.
Kellogg, secretary, and Mr. Saufley in
the position first mentioned.
During his brief stay here the Phoe
nix business man took occasion to say
that Chloride was well thought of in
that section of the country and that
more money was available from the
capital for investment in the Cerbats.
