"KING COLE" LEADS
No more pleasurable sensation
can be felt in nn nernnlnnn vicln
than by an excursion in the newl
1917 8-cylinder Cole the successor
to the famous "Brown Clipper,"
driven by the owner, Mr. W. II.
IlubbeU.
In the lead, as usual, Mr. Hub
bel has very appropriately "chris
tened" his beautiful and copious
car the "King Cole." Since the
ordinary car does the ordinary
thing one would not expect to
find the same luxuries in a car of
several years ago as in this com
modious car superior in quality
and in the minutest detail.
To take a ride in King Cole one
comes out of the past into the
present. So soft and velvety is
the motion of the car springs (be
ing long and flat) that they float
their load rather than support it,
the scientific balance of chassis ab
sorbing all road shock instead of
transmitting it to the passengers.
Those desiring tc see the city
would find no greater pleasure
than by securing the King Cole
as Mr. Hubbel, the owner, is care
ful and painstaking and is able
to point out all points of interest
in tho town, at the same time en
joying a luxurious ride.
Mr. Hubbel can be reached by
calling Bell phone, East 2013, or

WALTER S.
To whom Indications Point as the
Walter S. Dickey, the Republican
candidate for United States senator
from Missouri, is matchless as a poli
tical leader and organizer and In his
present campaign, by his masterful
tactics has won from his friends the
title of "the Mark Hanna of Missouri."
Mr. Dickey has been a conspicuous
and able leader In the Republican
party of Missouri for 30 years but has
never sought for himself, political
preferment of any kind and never
offensively dictated to those who were
placed in power by his efforts. He
came to Missouri in 1885 and at once
identified himself with the Republican
party of Kansas City. His ability as
an able organizer was recognized a
year later, by his election to member
ship of the Republican City Commit
tee. In 1900 he was made chairman
of the Jackson County Republican
Committee, and under his efficient
management the party that year won
its first victory in 27 years. In 1904
he directed the campaign in Kansas
City which resulted In the election of
a Republican mayor and council. Later
In the same year, as chairman of the
executive committee of the Republican
State Committee he aided in giving
the electoral vte of Missouri to Theo
dore Roosevelt, which was a most sur
prising achievement.
In 1908, he accomplished a still

state chairman, by delivering the elec

In forty years. During this campaign
Mr. Dickey removed to St. Louis, to
I establish more effective headquarters.
leaving his family and large business
interests in Kansas City for five

to the cause for party success.
His matchless energy and ability as

I Personally Mr. Dickey Is genial, ap
proachable, and democratic. He Is
clean handed and all his processes
have endured all the tests of public
scrutiny. He is sympathetic and gen-
I erous and the needs and interests of
his fellow men have a large place In
his mind and heart. It Is the posses
sion of these qualities that have en
abled him to rise from the humble
post of a clerk to the presidency of a
business concern which operates 23
plants in eleven different states.
