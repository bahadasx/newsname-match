Advocates Immigration Commission
to Secure Homeseekers' Rates
to State.
(By a Staff Correspondent)
Tenstrike. Minn., Oct. 14.Chas.
S. Carter, candidate for representa
tive from the sixty-second district,
believes that Friday the thirteenth
is luoky. At least, he opened his
campaign on that date in this vil
lage.
Judging from the size of the audi
ence and the enthusiasm with which
his address was received his candi
dacy has struck a popular chord.
The meeting was held in the Ten
strike school house and besides Ten
strike citizens many from rural dis
tricts attended. There were a large
number of women in the audience.
Fellows Presides.
Mayor William Fellows presided at
the meeting and introduced Ed Alger
who in turn introduced Mr. Carter
AS a pioneer of Beltrami county.
"There is no man in Northern Min
^jf^nesota who is more alive to the legis
A^iative needs of this county than Mr.
]f Carter," said Mr Alger "He has a
faculty of going out and bringing
back what he goes after It is time
to cease voting for men who cannot
produce the goods I am sure that
if Mr. Carter is elected he will work
unceasingly and willingly for the best
interests of the county and state."
Opposes Bitch Bonds.
Mr Carter in opening his address
explained why he entered the legis
lative race. He explained how he
was interested in bringing settlers
to this county and how he saw that
some changes were necessary if more
settlers were to be brought to this
district to remain here.
*-t. "I am opposed to the further issu
ing of ditch bonds in this district un
til the present judicial ditch law is
amended so that ditches will be con
structed only where the quality of
the soil, prospective settlement and
general conditions warrant the
same," said Mr. Carter He explain
ed the Volstead act, the construction
of ditches and the issuing of bonds,
and stated that the total ditch bonds
to date, according to an abstractor's
Report, amounted to $1,812,350. Be
des this there are $1,011,500 bonds
authorized but not issued, bringing
the total amount of bonds to $2,823,-
850, he stated
Against Raising Values.
He opposed the inflating of the
valuations and stated that if elected
he would do all he could to relieve
the county from any possible future
payment of ditch loans.
"I believe that the operation of the
present judicial ditch law is exces-
sive," he said "The homes and
property of our citizens, which are
pledged for the payment of the in
terest and principal of these bonds
have been jeopardized by the enor
mous issue of bonds and the high rate
of interest paid therefor
Drainage Necessary.
Mr Carter told of his recent trip
with Senator D. O'Neil and Mr.
Dugan, Federal examiner, down the
Red Lake river to investigate flood
conditions He explained that some
action must be taken to protect the
settlers along the river from floods
as a result of emptying ditches into
Red Lake, whose outlet was not large
enough to dispose of the water
"St He urged the securing of better co
ofcpration between the state immigra
tion commission and the railways to
secure homeseekers' and settlers'
rates to Minnesota
"Almost every other state in the
Union has homeseeker rates," he
said "Why
can'tWMinnesota
the same rates7
WK.-4sky.,
have
want and need
more settlers
He urged the construction of a
state roadway from the Red River
valley to the Iron Range
For Trunk Road.
"The Iron Range is practically our
back yard neighbors," he said "Only
a distance of about 70 miles, yet we
have no good roads With good
roads, products from the valley could
5* shipped to consumers on the range
\n trucks or in automobiles in a
short time A farmer could leave his
home in the morning with his truck
of grain or supplies, go to the range,
sell them and return the same day
if we had a good road system I
will take up the matter with Com
mercial clubs and other organizations
to get sitch a road."
In conclusion of bis address he
stated that his promises were not nu
merous- as such promises were soon
forgotten after election, but that his
nromises were few in number and
tat they would be religiously kept

FORTY CENTS PER MONTE
SUBMAR|NE
America's Hands are Tied Pressure
Increased Against Neutral
Rights.
By George F. Authier.
Chicago, 111., Oct. 14.Transfer-
ence of the German submarine actlf
ity to the coast waters of the United!
States has given a new and startling
angle to President Wilson's foreign,
policy. This submarine activity, IfT
successfujjy continued, amounts to
nothing more or less than a blockade*
of America. It means the destruc
tion of American commerce, for Am
erican commerce is carried in foreign
bottoms. It threatens destruction of
the artificial prosperity in which Ant
erica is now reveling, and more than
threatens to involve this country in
complications, either with Germany
or with the allied powers, or with
both.
Was Not Prepared.
Both situations were the direct re
sult of a policy which announced In
advance that, no matter what was.
done this country was not prepared
to defend its rfghts. The American
government was saved from being
forced into complications only be
cause wisdom took counsel with rel
sentment, and the German govern
ment withdrew temporarily from its
position
In this withdrawal was coupled a
condition, namely, that the American
government compel Great Britain to
observe neutral rights On April 19
the president had sent to Germany an
ultimatum setting forth that"un
less the imperial German government
should now immediately declare and
trfect an abandonment of its present
methods of warfare against passenger
and freight carrying vessels, this
country could have no choice but to
sever diplomatic relations with the
government of the German empire al
together." One of the conditions in
sisted upon by this government was,
that no liner should be torpedoed,
and that the lives of passengers
should be safeguarded yet. in the
torpedo attack the other day the "Ste
phano," a liner, was torpedoed, and
passengers and crew were compelled
to entrust their lives in small boats
on the open sea. American destroy
ers were on hand to rescue them, but
their presence was a matter of luck,
and the entire situation shows upon
what a narrow margin rests the ele
ment of safety for this country. The
administration has held that, en
trusting passengers to the safety of
small boats hardly comes under the
head of protection of life Given the
absence of destroyers, or the presence
of a rough sea there would undoubt
edly have been loss of life
liable to Error.
This is not the only danger in
volved in the situation Submarine
commanders, brave and intelligent as
they undoubtedly are, are only human
and liable to error. Given such a
mistake the safety of the country is
involved, or else the administration
will again be compelled to eat its own
words
Still another complication is in
volved. The campaign against sub
marines cannot be carried on with
the utmost nicety of regard for in
ternational situations. All submar
ines look alike, and the rulie in hunt
ing the submarine is to shoot first
and investigate afterwards. Either
American submarines will have to
abandon American waters, or the al
lied warships will be compelled to
abandon the German submarine. Thin

"Keeping Us Ont of War" Results
in Situation That Threatens
Complications.
ADMINISTRATION NOW
BETWEEN TWO SIRES
4
There can be no question but the*
revival of this submarine activity car
ried out under the very nose at tb*
president, is a result of a well un
derstood decision to remain at peace,,
at any price, and not to resent any
aggression upon American rights.
Invited Complications.
The announced decision of the ad
ministration, made early in its his
tory, not to resent any aggression up
on neutral rights, as exemplified in~
Mr. Bryan's cooling-off treaties, and
the practical application of this,
theory in the abandonment of Amer
icans to their fate in Mexico, invited
the first complications. Great Brit
ain and the allied powers were the
first offenders. They could have
been most easily brought to terms, be
cause they were depending upon Am
erican shipments for the successful,
prosecution of the war, but the econ
omic failure of the Underwood tariff
law made an artificial war prosperity
absolutely essential, and it was not
done. There could have been no
other reason, for the president had
declared for a policy of neutrality in
thought, as in deed. Acknowledging'
that there is no comparison between
the sacrifice of lives and the destruc
tion of property, it must be admitted
that Germany had greater excuse
than the allied powers for violating*
neutrality, because the precedent had
already been established by England.
