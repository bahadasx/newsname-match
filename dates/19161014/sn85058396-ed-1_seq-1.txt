Millions Killed.
; Berlin, Oct. 14. By wireless to Say-
vllle.) British and French divisions
with a total of more than one million
men have been virtually annihilated
in the Somme battle, says the mili
tary critic of the Overseas News
agency. According to figures from
Swiss sources, as given by the news
' agency, the Russian losses from June
; 1 to October 2 were about one million
men.
The news agency's military critic
writes:
"The heavy sacrifices made by the
British and French for the recapture
of each square yard on the Somme
is proved by the fact that in three
! and one-halt months about ninety
i fresh divisions were virtually anni
hilated, so that it was necessary to
; withdraw them forever. (Ninety dl-
, visions represents a total of consid
erably more than 1,000,000 mei. There
are about 12,000 men in a French dl-
vision and 10,000 in a British divi
sion.) "These divisions disappeared com
, , pletely from battle. Fifty-five divi
sions in consequence of their great
losses, were able to engage in com-
i - bat only twice, fifteen divisions htree
R times and only one was able to en
gage in combat four limes. Four di
h 1 visions had suffered so severely after
their second engagement that it was
i s necessarv to send them to quiet sec
tors, but on critical days they were
again thrown in."

KING OF GREECE
IN GRAVE FEAR
Predicted That Rumania
Would Be Crushed by Teu
tons in 15 Days.
London, Oct. 14. "When a high
diplomatic personage besought King
Constantino to change his policy,"
says the Dally Telegraph's Athens
correspondent, "the king replied: 'I
prefer to lose my throne rather than
endanger Greece. I am convinced that
in fifteen days Rumania will exist no
more. If Greece went into the war,
then, after the conquest of Rumania,
the irrestlble German forces would
be directed against Greece and she
would share the fate of Serbia and
Rumania.' "
According to the Athen's dispatches
received hero the entente allies sent
their ultimatum to Greece because
they had unearthed a Royalist plot
to fight the entente. It was planned,
the dispatches add, that if the allies
should seek to coerce Greece into
joining them and try to force Eleu
therios Venizelos upon King Constan
tlne, the king should retire northward
along the railway, taking the troops
Thessaly, and entrench there until
the arrival of the German forces,
when he would strike in unison with
them at the allies.
GREECE ACCEPTS LATEST
DEMANDS OF ENTENTE
London, Oct. 13, 9:14 p. m. "Ad

behalf of the allies, the control of tho
Greek police, the prohibition of Greek
citizens from carrying arms, the stop
ping of sending war munitions to
Thessaly, and the lifting of the em
bargo on tho transportation of Thes
salian wheat. The Greek cabinet sat
with the chief of tho general staff un
till midnight discussing the note. The

when all the demands of Admiral Du
Fournet were granted."
"The British minister here has vis

Republican Talkers Making

PROGRESSIVES PRAISED
No Group of Men Ever More
Pitifully Deceived by
Party Leaders.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct 14. "The
most Interesting element of the Re
publican party now is tho vocal," said
the president "The vocal element Is
not running for offico but is making
promises while tho element which has
been nominated is making no prom
ises." "The president praised tho "rank
and file" of tho Progressive party,
saying no group of men were "ever
more pitifully deceived." He attack
ed the leaders of that party.
Political Gangs Seek Power.
"Tho Democratic party in the last
few years has redeemed tho promises
of the Progressive party and of the
Democratic party," Mr. Wilson added.
He discussed conditions in Now Jer
sey and Pennsylvania, saying the old
"political gangs" aro seeking a return
to power.
"You have seen tho gentlemen who
claim to lead the Progressive cle
ment of tho Republican party make
an abject surrender," tho president
declared. He added this had hap
pened all over the country. He at
tacked what ho termed the "corrupt
elements" of tho Republican party.
"If their loaders want Americans to
get tneir ngnis everywnore, wuy
don't the rank and filo of the Repub
licans help them to got their rights?"
askod tho president, after alluding to
the Republicans who voted to warn
Americans off armed ships.
Mr. Wilson for the first timo spoke
of the necessity for electing a Demo
cratic congress. Tho "old guard," ho
charged, controls the Republicans in
congress.
Referring to criticisms of his for
eign policies, the president declared
tho "vocal" part of tho Republican
party wanted war, while the "silent"
part wanted peace in somo other way
than he had maintained It He added
the country knew it was at peace and
was satisfied.
Referring to European' questions
and to Mexico, he said it was, neces
sary and best that the attitude of the
United States bo settled.
"I am doubtful over the outcome,"
ho said. "America is always ready
to fight for things that are Ameri
can," continued tho president "What
Europe is beginning to realize is that
wo are saving ourselves for greater
things. We are saving ourselves for
that league of nations that will come
to maintain peace."
"Some people aro losing their,

Cleaning Reservoirs
Where Much Silt Has I
Been Accumulating I
Work of establishing a safeguard
against contamination of Ogden's wa
ter supply was started this morning
when a forco of men from the fire
department began the task of flush
ing the mud and silt from the bottom
and sides of the larger of the two
reservoirs on the bench lands, at the
east city limits. The mud and slit
represents the accumulations of more
than two years, tho reservoir not hav
ing been cleaned out since the com
pletion of the new pipe line.
Commissioner Miles L. Jones, who
this morning visited tho scene of op
erations, which are .under the direc
tion of Chief Graves of the fire de
partment, stated that he doubted if
the recent mishap which let muddy
water in the main pipe at the Wheel
er canyon Intake had resulted In in
creasing the depth of the deposit,
which appeared in a solid layer about
four inches thick.
The commissioner stated that the
decision to clean the reservoir at this
time of year was reached after the
commission had determined that
more water would bo available for
the flushing operations now owing to
a decrease In consumption. Draining
at this time, he stated, also would
give the city opportunity to make
needed repairs to tho east wall of the
reservoir which had been damaged in
the month of August, when a break in
the concrete at the intake allowed the
water to seep in under the wall, forc
ing concrete up. At the apex In sev
eral bulges, large fissures appear.
Tho damaged area includes several
blocks of tho concrete. Tho repairs
. will necessitate the expenditure of
from $S00 to $1,000. Commissioner
Jones said this could have been avoid
ed had tho contractors in building the
reservoir taken the precaution to re
inforce the intake aperture with steel.
Just plain concreto could not stand
the continued pressure.
In the flushing operations, three
streams of water are kept constantly
at play on tho mud, driving it under
power furnished by one of the auto
pump and horse trucks from tho cen
tral station- The fire truck is sta
tioned on the drivewaj' between the
two reservoirs. Water from the small
er reservoir to the north is being
used. Two men are stationed with
the engine, which is kept in constant
operation, while seven are at work In
the pit, two at the effective end of the
three-hose lines, and one at the outlet
at the southwest corner, where tho
mudy water flows out to tho bottom
lands where It loses itself either in
natural holes or by seeping into the
ground. t
Preparations for tho flushing pro
cess wore started several days ago.
Practically all the water had been
drained out by Thursday night.
Chief Graves said the work proba
bly will not be completed before
sometime tomorrow. He stated he
proposed to press operations however,
and that another shift of workers
would be on hand to take up the work
when tho present shift went off duty.
Work of repairing the damage to
the south wall will be started imme
diately after the flushing operations
are finished. As son as this work
is completed, the water will be let In
again, and attention will be turned to
the smaller reservoir, which will be
drained In preparation for the begin
ning of flushing operations there.
Whatever repairs are needed in this
reservoir will be made before tho
water Is let into it again.
With the completion of this task,
tho city waterworks system will be
moved a stop nearer perfection. Com
missioner Jones said the finishing
touches were now being applied to
the twenty-ninth well in tho Hunts
villo district.

Falls City, Nebr., Oct. 14. Charles jH
E. Hughes today opened his campaign
in Nebraska from the rear platform
of his car to a crowd of farmers at ll
the station here. The nominee out- IH
lined his policy of a protective tariff, H
declared that the present prosperity iH
of the country was due to the "stim- IH
ulus of the European war," and that iH
when the war ceased there would be '1
"a great deal of labor disappointed in IH
this country." H
Mr. Hughes also assailed the ad- IH
ministration for its Mexican policy. iH
He declared that extension abroad of jH
American trade would not be accom
plished unless American rights were
fully maintained. IH
Must Maintain Dignity. IH
"We must remember," he said,
'lean merchants, American engineers,
American traders, the boys who go jH
forth in the various opportunities that
are afforded in connection with IH
branch houses abroad; It is perfectly
idle to ask them to go forward in the
interest of American enterprise if the
American flag does not mean full pro
tection to every citizen lawfully en- IH
gaged, wherever we have a recogni
tion of the dignity of our own citizen
ship and are prepared to maintain our
own rights. Now, I am a man of
No Danger of War.
"Nothing to me is more extraordi
nary than the claim of this adminis
tration that it has kept us out ol
war. Only inexcusable blundering jH
could have gotten us Into war.
"We did not have peace in Mexico.
We had war. It was an ignoble war
fare; it was a personal war. It was
not based on anything that is sane- -H
tioned by International lw. It was a
matter of vindictlveness to destroy
the only semblance of government IH
Mexico had. tl
"We have had no proper policy of tH
peace in Mexico. I desire to see
peace maintained, but it will not be
maintained unless we have It under- !
stood that we do not propose to med- IH
dlo with things that do not concern
us, and, in the next place, that the jl
just rights of our citizens with re
spect to their lives and property will
be maintained."
Eight-Hour Law Gold Brick.
Wymore, Neb., Oct. 14. At the rail
way Junction here where the Hughes
special stopped to change engines, jH
several railroad employes crowded
around the rear platform. Mr. Hughea
came out and waved his hand.
"Tell us about the Adamson law," jH
some one shouted. Mr. Hughe3 had
not intended to speak here, but accept
ed tho invitation.
"I think this bill was a 'gold brick
for labor," he said. "That is my opin
ion of it. I do not think it will get
labor anywhere. If wages can be ll
raised over night in response to force IjM
properly applied, you can have wage3
reduced by law, sometimes over night.
according to the application of the
proper amount of force.
"I am absolutely opposed to dealing
Iwith things without knowledge and
having legislation passed by either
congress or state legislatures- when kH
the men who are passing the laws do
not know whether they are just or not ll
and do not pretend to know. That Is
not a fair way of doing business."
Mr. Hughes spoke for five minutes
outlining his views on tho law. He
was interrupted twice by applause.
