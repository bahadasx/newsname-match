Proclamation.
Realizing the importance of the
Parish Fair to this community, and
being a strong believer in the good
effects the exhibition has in promot
ing interest in the products of the
parish and the work of the schools,
I do preclaim Thursday, October 26,
a holiday, to be set aside for the en
joyment of the general public, and I
ask that places of business be closed
on that day from 12 o'clock noon
until 6 p. m., so as to give full oppor
tunity, for all to participate in the
,opening of the fair and the pleasures
of the day.
Given uider my hand and official
ea. this 13th day of October, 1916.

SCENE IN "WHERE ARE MY CHILOREN,' THE PARKYIEW
The powerful Universal
production "Where Are My
Children?" will open Friday,
Oct. 27, at the Parkview
Theatre for what is expected
". l will be the most successful
-run of any motion picture ihr
Covington. In the picture
are shown two mothers, one
beaming with maternal pride
upon her baby; the other
-content to fondle a pedigreed
poodle. The subject of this
picture is birth-control. It
is treated from two angles
the result of too many child
ren in the crowded slums
and the suppression of the
unborn in the homes of the
wealthy.
"Where Are My Children"
will create a profound
impression on e ver y
man and woman who
sees it. Louis Weber,
to whose credit goes
the writing and direc
tion of the production,
has handled the theme
in such an infinitely
delicate manner that
the possibility of of
fense to the most re
fined is out of the ques
tion.
Th e management of
the Parkview Theatre
has decided
in the pre
senta t io n
I of the pic
ture to fol
low the de-4
cree of the
National
Board of
Censors by
refusing admission to children under sixteen years unless accompanied by
parent or guardian.
This production will be here for two days, Friday and Saturday, Oc
tober 27th and 2;8th, during the fair..Daily matinees will be operated. t
LEWIS TALKS OF
THE PARISH
FAIR, ETC.
Discusses the Opportunities
of Profitable Farming
On Cheap Lands.
A country or section in its in
fancy, as far as agricultural develop
ment is concerned, needs a fair and
cannot reach an area of prosperity
as early without it. The fair .a8ts
as a big book to our farmers as wel1
as to all visitors. It tells the story
as no man could tell it. It shows the
goods before their eyes, and seeing
is believing. In this parish we have
so many thousands of undeveloped
acres of.land that any one would be
safe in saying that it is in nits In
fancy as far as agricultural develop
ment is concerned. We have so
many acres of cheap land, land that
will grow a crop more than sufficient
to pay for first cost of land that it is
our duty to advertise our lands anc,
opportunities as much as possible.
When a visitor comes to this section
he naturally wants to know, first, of
all, what can we grow here and hos
much of it to the acre. He does no.
care to have you tell him 'what car
be done but he wants to see a sampl
of some of our crop growing.- Thi
fair is the place to show this. We
are going to have more visitors this
year at oUr fair that .ie ever had,
and if we do not have something 'to
show them it will not be my fault.
It is the duty of every man and wo
man in the parish to help in this
work. We all will be benefited by
it in the long run.
We know the day of the lumber
king and turpentine lord is about
gone and when 'we awake and find
the many thousands of acres of what'
was once virgin pine timber all gone,
nothing but stumps and grass left,
where are the taxes coming from
even at the present rate of taxation?
There can be but one answer-from
improved lands, Mr. Farmer. . We
can see that it is very important to
get every man that will do so to
clear up land and go to farming.
Every time a ten-acre tract of lanr
is cleared a higher rate of assessmen
is placed on that land, because it i
more valuable. In this parish I d.
not believe there is over 2 per cer
of the total acreage in cultivatior
Suppose there were 25 per cent i
cultivation? It would give us plent
of money to run schools, build road
and all other public improvement
and still not pay as high rate as w,
do now. There is no getting arour
it. We have got to get down t<
figuring and when we finish figurin'
we have got to push the farmer onu
to the fron . as far as we can gel
him. He i the dominant factor ir
the futurpe prosperity of St. Tam
many.
'We need a fair worse than somr
of our border parishes because we
are less developed than they are.
They could get along very well w',
ourt one if they wanted to, but they
do not want to. We need a fair b4
e~use we lAve Zp rq poor live stock'
than some ' tfe ptlpr parishes have
When a man goes to the fair an!
4,
sees fine Duroc pigs and the Berk
shires, he sees the fine cattle and
other exhibits, he goes back home
thinting and perhaps will have a long
talk with his wife that night aftei
:supper about what they had seen at
the fair and why they too could raise
or grow some of the fine things tha:
had been seen, instead of the razor
back hogs, game chickens and nub
bins of corn they had been raising.
This does the home man good an..
spreads from one to another, even I.
all did not get to come to the fair.
The visitor is impressed by the quali
ty of the exhibits and from the man
good things that he had heard about
the soil here from all sides, he goes
back home, and he may live in some
d r state, and tell his friends about
tll country almost as good as that
Moses was looking for during the %
years of wandering in the wilderness,
called the land of Canaan. He will
tell his friends about seeing sugar
cane nine and ten feet long, better
t~ they grow in the sugar belt; he
will mention our hne corn enhili'
and they will want to know how
much of this can be grown to the
acre. He can tell them about as
follows:
Case No. 1--.W. A. Hood, Onvil,
La.-Planted ten acres ,pine up-land,
Light red clay sub-soil, in oats about
5th to 10th of November, last. Cost
of breaking land and properly har
rowing then planting, about '$4..
per acre. Cost of seed $2.40 per
acre. In February lespedeza wa.P
sown over the land without any other
work or preparation being done.
Seed and sowing cost $2.00 per acre.
In May oats were cut and baled
vield per acre of 30 bales, cost of
gutting and baling, $3.00 per acre.
July's first cutting of lespedeza gave
15 bales per acre. Second cutting
ing October gave 50 bales per acre.
Cost of cutting and baling both
cuttings, $4.00 per acre. This then
brings us up to the first of October,
and let us see what he did in profit
making, and at the same time paying
for land:
300 bales oats at 70e.... 210.00
650 bales lespedeza at 75c 487.50
$697.50
First cost of land, includ

Cost of oat and lespedeza
seed ...... ......... 4.40
All labor cost as itemized. 11.55
Total cost per acre .... 40.95
Ten acres cost ........ 409.50
This gives a net profit of $288 on
on the ten acres, or about $28.00 per
acre in 11 months, and land in shape

tumps are out and soil in good con

knocked down by several cross tie:r
falling from the car, and the car .1
passed over him, meshing his foo'

TWO PATHFINDERS IN COVING
TON.
A big twelve-cylinder pathfinder
of the Jackson Highway was in Cov
ington Monday evening. The party
was welcomed to the Southern Hotel
by Mr. Ellis. There were in the par
ty: R. E. Tov'ler, Washington, D.
C.; W. L.'Brown, Frankfort, Ind.;
W. H. Cuin, Salem, Ind.; Charles
Priest and W. R. Gibbs, Chicago;
Emory G. Dent, Bowling Green, Ky.
Mr. E. J. Domergue had telephon
ed Messrs. Warner and Mackie, presi
dent and vice-president of the Asso
ciation of Commerce, of the coming
of the car, and they met and welcom
ed them. The party passed. back on
their return to Chicago, leaving Cov
ington Tuesday morning and reach
ing Slidell at 7:00 a. m., where they
were met by Mr. U. G. Neuhauser,
and passing over Indian Village fer
ry at 7:30.
Thursday afternoon another path
finder arrived. President E. G. Davis
of the Covington Bank & Trust Com
pany made arrangements for sevel.
cars to meet the party.
A NEW GIRL AT ONVIL.
Two of the happiest people on the
train from New .Orleans the other
day were Mr. and Mrs. W. A. Hood.
They are always happy, but this day
was an extra hoppy day, or rather,
an extraordinarily happy day, for
they were bringing to their home a
wee might of a baby, but a few weeks
of age. Mr. Hood was in his shirt
sleeves, because it was a very warm
day, but nevertheless he persisted in
putting the blanket over the baby,
which would have been more com
fdrtable in ifts "nighty," if that's
what you call the little strip of cloth
that goes around them. It may be
predicted that if baby does not pros
per it will be because its new father
and mother who have adopted it love
it to death. Both its parents are
dead. We want to caution Mr. Hood,
in. his excitement, that there is no
law to dip babies. Only his cattle.
FOOTBALL AT
-ST. PAUL'S
COLLEGE
St. Paul and Baton Rouge
High Will Make It Inter
esting for Spectators.
The football game between Baton
Rouge 'Hi and St. Paul's College, that
was to have taken place but was post
poned on account of illness of some
.aton Rouge boys, will be played at
3t. Paul's Stadium to-day, October
14th, at 3:30 p. m., sharp. There
will be no postponement this time.
.t should be a-very interesting game.
J6RONER SHOULD FIEST BE NOS,
TIFIED BEFORE BODIiB
ARE MOVED.
Igabrance of the law sometimes
makes considerable trouble, and es
peelally is this true in the matter
if moving bodies of those who have
seen accidently or otherwise killed;
and in some cases create sunneces
sary expense for the parish. It
shoudd be borne in mind that the law
requires the coroner to view all bod
.ee of those suddenly stricken, with
-th or those who have died from
ses not related to illness which
aas been under the treatment of a
.egular physician.
Recently Coroner Bulloch has had
to tarvel to Bogalusa (the Marshal
3ase ) to view a body where the death
wounds were received in this parish,
and to Lacombe (the Lewis case) to
view the body of a man killed near
Slidell. In the latter case it was his
unpleasant duty to interrupt burial
seremoqles in order to fulfill his duty
as coroner. A death certificate had
been given by a colored physician,
who did not know that the coronet
must first act.
The coroner should be notified in
all cases of death resulting from ac
oident or violence, and the body
should ~ot be disturbed except by his
order, or in his absence from the
parish, the order of some authorized
person..
THE INDICTMENT OF DUTRUCHI.
At its last session the grand jury
brought in a true bill against A. J.
Dutruch and his.daughter, Mrs. Jen
nie Reviere, for retailing without a,
license. They were' put under $500
appearance bond.
Of course the grand jury must have
testimony of a nature to warrant the
finding of a bill, but the reputation
of the Dutruch family would hardly
mark them as criminals. In fact,
they are the kind of people whose in
dusntry has helped tp show what St.
Tammany parish may do in the way
of growing th!igs on the farm.. Mr.
Dutruch is an expert grape grower,
and has a paying vineyard, from
which he produces an excellent wine
that has won a reputation that cau.
as people to purchase ft in preference
to wines made outside the parish.
He has been selling this wine for
over thirty years and no sedet has
been made of It.

read at a meetin, discussed and or

This statement is made in justice
to Mr. Lyon, whose feel were
hurt -because numerous r m i, that
were. false and unfounded in their
statements that enormous amounts
were collected for traveling expenses,
reached his office: nd caused himao to
refuse to use his own car In visiting
the schools.
The record will show that in many
instances the amounts charged by
Mr. Lyon for trips made were less
than half ,the amount asked by livery
men known to the board.
This statement is'also madle in an
effort to have Mr. Lyon .again use
his own car for "viiting sohools hua
order that the greatest mneount of.
good can be aooomplished by 'tt3
-board with the funds available.
