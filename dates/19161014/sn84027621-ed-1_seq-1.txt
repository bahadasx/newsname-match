VOL, 22 NO. 239
WRITES THE PRESIDENT TO THE
GOVERNOR OF NEW YORK
Withdrawal of National Guard from
the Border Would Invite Repeti
tion of Raids, Says Mr.
Wilson
(Associated Press) '
V Long Branch. Oct. 14.The emer
gency which caused the sending of
national guardsmen to the Mexican
. border "unhappily still exists,"- Presi-
dent Wilson wrote Governor Whit
man, of New York, Monday. He added
however, that he believed conditions
in Northern Mexico were improving
and "in the near future" it probably
" would be possible to "do more than
has been done to relieve the embar
rassment under which the organized
militia , regiments have necessarily
suffered." ,
The president's letter was made
public today. It was written in reply
to one from Governor Whitman re
garding the New. York guardsmen on
; the border. The president said the
war department had advised him the
withdrawal of the militia at any time
since they were sent to the border
would likely have been followed by
' fresh border raids.

AN APPRECIATION ;
". Mrs. William Dempsey Taylor
In the early morning of October
the fifth, nineteen hundred and six
teen, God sent his angel3 to carry
Mrs. William Dempsey Taylor (nee
Bessie MacKay) to her home with
him. In his infinite mercy he took
her before sorrow had touched her
joyous young life. While we cannot
understand why a life so useful, so
full of promise should be ended on
earth, yet death is,
"Just a going away into another
country, a beautiful mystery through
which we pass as through an open
gate with glad surprise "at the things
that shall be made plain, and with a
great sense of triumph,"
We know that our father cannot
make a mistake and that it was done
in love. .,
Not only we of the Presbyterian
church of Ocala, but the whole com
munity has sustained a loss, since she
built a road of "The Loving Heart"
all through her life.' She was a living
epistle of the greatest of all graces
love. It beamed from her refined fact
upon all about her, and it materialized
Into daily labors and tasks.
Hers was such a rare character that
it is impossible to express the love
and appreciation we feel. Since a
small child, as Bessie MacKay, she
wa3 in the Sunday school; then, unit
! ing with the church, she served in all
the branches of the work, at -different
times being teacher of the primary
class, secretary and treasurer of the
missionary society, singing- in the
choir, working in the aid society and
the embroidery circle..
. While fitted - to"- erace the most
prominent places, she was uniformly
found doing the things which others
Had overlooked. - '

Paradise thy abiding place may be,
but we feel that it is near the deep,

BOARD OF TRADE
A Well Attended and Interesting
Meting of the Commercial
Body
Friday night was C the regular
monthly meeting night" of the board
of trade. There were! about fifteen
members present when I the president
called the meeting to order, and the
number rapidly increased to twenty
five or more. v ""N . ..
The question of Ocala making an
effort to secure the Masonic home and
orphanage was fully discussed, with
the result of a committee of five be
ing appointed to make investigations
and get offers of contributions of land
or other things of value as induce
ments toward having the : committee
from the grand lodge locate the. insti
tution at Ocala.
Organization of the Central Florida
chamber of commerce was discussed.
No action taken. .
Correspondence concerning the es
tablishment of : a business college &t
Ocala was brought before the meet
ing, as information, and the secretary
.was instructed to handle the matter.
Committee appointed at the , last
meetinff of the board to look into the
freight rate question, comparatively
between Ocala and Jacksonville and
Gainesville and Jacksonville, for- the
purpose of ascertaining whether any
irregularities or discriminatory rates
existed, made its report showing that
the difference in freight rates was
due to greater mileage to Ocala and
that no discrimination was . discern
ible. .
Secretary ; called attention to the
fact that he had received forty letters
asking for information, booklets, etc.,
from parties who had stated that the
name of the Ocala board of trade had
been seen in the Florida First adver
tising, and that it was likely that a
good many more of the inquiries had
also secured our address from the
Florida First ads. who did not men
tion that fact.
Tampa's trade extension Ctour, its
objects, purposes, etc., was taken up
and discussed at length. Some were
of the opinion that it would possibly
tend toward taking business that
might otherwise be given the .whole
salers of Ocala, and that the merch
ants and wholesalers of Ocala should
have their attention called to the tour
before this body takes any steps to
ward getting a meeting for the men
of the tour. A committee of one was
appointed to ;. call on the Ocala mer
chants and get their views and senti
ments regarding Tampa's trade tour
and make report to the board before
taking further steps in the matter."
Owing to a number of important
matters that will be coming up fre
uenqtly during the . winter, it was
moved and carried that during the
winter we have two meeting nights
each month, and the second and fourth
Friday nights were named as meeting
nights. - '-
The question of making an effort to
get the delegates who attend the
farmers' union at Palatka in Novem
ber to come to Ocala was taken up
and the importance of the opportunity
was forcibly brought to the attention
of the meeting. Ocala will have a
large delegation in Palatka during
the meeting in November for the pur
pose of bringing them to Ocala. Spe
cial low rates on the railroad have
been assured. , The fair association
has and is giving its co-operation to
get the delegates here during the fair.
Mr Barritt, president of the farmers
union, has assured us that he would
use his best efforts to assist us in the
matter, and it looks good for a big
crowd of the farmer delegates to be
headed this way. '"V, ' ; v :

REMINISCENCE
XII.
Editor Star: Well my furlough has
ended; at least it had reached the
limit of time that I could remain at
home and reach the front in time to
answer at roll call before I would be
marked "absent without leave," in
which case all of the sweetness of the
time spent at home would be elim-.
mated by what would follow. So now,
here I am out on the long, broad
piazza of the loved old home, about
to say "goodbye" to the dear ones
sheltered by its roof, and .whose faces
I was destined not to see again for
three long years -three historic years,
pi egnant with hardships, trials, per
plexities, sanguinary conflicts, victor
ies, defeats, joys, sorrows and in fact
almost every phase of experience that
humanity could encounter -I say that
advisedly, for it is a fact that through
it all there were, here and there,
pleasant and enjoyable events running
through it all like threads of silk in a
woof of wool. I began the good-byes
with my ' two brothers who were too
young to enter the service, then my
sister then in her early teens, then
with father who kissed me on the
cheek and said, "It is unnecessary for
me to remind you, for we know you
Will do your duty as a man." - Then
last; of. all was mother. She with a
long, crushing embrace and kisses on
cheeks and lips, said, "Good-bye,
Laurie. May God bless and protect
you, and send you back to us, some
day, sound and well." And now I had
lingered to the last precious moment,
so went out to the . gate ' and was
driven off for the railroad station,
with my eyes looking back at the dear
bid home and the group on the piazza
as long as I could see them. Ah! me!
Little did I dream then that in speak-,
ing those good-byes, that I .was bid
ding farewell forever to the ante
bellum life as it existed then on the
old Southern plantations! That ideal
life where the mingling and associa
tion of cultured, courteous and chival-
ric men and beautiful, v accomplished
and refined women in the conditions
and environments then prevailing,
constituted a mortal social existence
of peace, pleasure, purity and happi
ness the like of which this world has
nowhere else ever seen since Paradise
was lost. What though the Code
Duelo was in every gentleman's li
brary; it served a far better, purpose
of adjusting "questions of honor"
than the barbarous hip-pocket prac
tice of these days, though truth to
tell, those of the hip-pocket brigade of
today - could have found no place in
the glorious old life of which I write.
Do not understand me now as advo
cating the re-establishment of the
Code Duelo for these times. I do not.
Present conditions forbid it. The so
cial zones existing then do not obtain
now. Then -they were as welL, defined
as the geographic circles around the
surface of the earth, the lines being
marked by intellect, culture, "refine
ment and good breeding. No so now
more the pity. Yes, I . bid all of
the old life farewell when I left the
old home at the end of my furlough,
for when I saw it. again three years
later, they had been shattered forever,
but in my memory the perfume of the
roses hang around them still. But 1
must get on back to my company and
resume my duties at the front. I will
not dwell on the journey back to the
camp. It is sufficient to say that , I
arrived there safe, sound and .sober
and in due time to prevent being re
ported "absent - without leave And
now after telling you of the pleasant
time I had on my furlough I am go
ing to record the most awful and hor
rible experience I passed through dur
ing the whole war. There were many
other places where the hardships and
fruffering were very, very great, but
in my opinion these that I am about
to relate reached the climax of human
endurance. I do not believe there was
any other time or place during the
civil war that equalled it. It may be
that in the world war now going on,
there may have been, some time and
place where the suffering, horrors and
terrible conditions may have been as
great, but I doubt even that. I am

Object of the Anti-Carranza Move

(Associated Press)
Washington," Oct. 14. The 1 Le

iences passed through and endured by
the garrison of Battery Wagner, on
Morris Island, S. C, during "the last
three days and nights before it was
evacuated. The Edisto Rifles consti
tuted a part of the force that made up
the garrison. I think I told in a pre
vious number, that the federals had
landed on Long Island and after
building masked batteries on the end
of that island nearest to Morris and
making whatother preparations they
thought necessary, began a heavy
bombardment of the south end of
Morris Island, in which their land
batteries were aided by the fleet then
in Charleston harbor. The creek sep
arating the two islands is not very
wide and timing themselves so as to
meet conditions, . they carried on a
heavy bombardment until the tide was
down and then made an assault with
infantry" and succeeded in effecting a
landing, driving back the small force
cf Confederate troops opposing them.
The Confederates had never made any
special effort to fortify that end of
the island, relying on Battery Wag
ner which reached across the island
near the center, and our troops, after
a sharp resistance of the enemy while
they were effecting a landing, grad-j
ually retired, fighting as they came
until they got under the protection of
the guns f Battery Wagner. ' A day
or two after the Federals landed they
made a heavy assault on Wagner af
ter havipg first heavily bombarded it
by fleet and land batteries. It was
a very disastrous assault for theFed
erals, resulting in their being repuls
ed with heavy losses in dead and
wounded. One regiment, the 54th, of
Massachusetts, colored troops, was
practically destroyed. : They were
nearly all mulattoes, and commanded
by white officers, the colonel of the
regiment being R. G. Shaw, who was
killed in the assault. The well known
Shaw memorial by Saint Gaudens was
placed on the Boston common jn 1897.
The attack was desperate and some
of the assailants reached the narapet
of the fort and fell inside when killed,
or wounded, and when they were re
pulsed and fled the ground in front of
the fort'was thickly strewn with the
dead and -they were all buried in one
long, wide, deep trench, including Col.
Shaw, when truce was had for bury
ing the dead. This assault was on the
18th of July, '63. - A short while after
that they made another assault but
it was not as vigorous and vicious as
the first and was also repulsed with
heavy loss to the enemy. After that
they settled themselves down to cap
ture the fort by a system of sapping
and mining,all the while subjecting
the fort, day after day, to bombard
ment by, fleet and land, and vicious
and accurate rifle firing by a, selected
bunch of sharpshooters. The garrison
in Wagner, after being under heavy
five all day, had to work all night re
pairing as far as possible, the damage
done by day. Morris Island is all
sand -no trees or vegetation on it of
any kind and is rough and rolled up
into irregular ridges and sand dunes
by the wind storms which have swept
over it for ages, the ocean beach be
ing the only smooth place along which
any one could very well travel, and
then only when the tide was down;
and the beach was swept by the guns
of the federal fleet. The fort was
built of sand and sand bags and the
water used by the garrison was ob
tained by sinking barrels into the
sand and allowing the sea water to
seep through the sand into the bar
rels. Of course it was always brack
ish at best, ' and often insufficient to
meet the demands.' The duty of gar
risoning the fort had now become
hard, gruelling and hazardous, and
the garrison was changed every four
or five days and fresh troops placed
in charge. On the first day of Sep
tember '63 a battalion of our regiment,-deluding
the Edisto Rifles,
with other troops, were sent over "to
relieve the force then on duty there,
and composed the garrison the last
five days before the fort was evac
uated by the Confederates, and the
Edisto Rifles were among the last to
leave when it was evacuated on the
night of the 6th of September. The

we made our , "get away" in small

which we successfully- accomplished
with the loss of one small boat con
taining Major F. F. IWarley , of the
2nd artillery, and a few others, which
was captured by the "enemy. As I
have already said, the service during
the last five days at Wagner was tha
severest and most horrible experience
I passed through during the entire
war. The first , two days the enemy
kept up a ' regular bombardment of
the fort from their land batteries and
the fleet, but when night came on
they would cease and we would spend
the night ' in hard continuous work
trying to repair some of the damage
done, and we had a couple of little
mortars that . we could still use, but
the enemy had by that time worked
their way so close up that we had to
cut the fuses so short that when the
shells would, explode some of the
fragments would come back in th
fort. We could and did, also throw
hand grenades over into their trench
es, but we were able to do this for
only the first two nights. The third
day at early dawn the enemy opened
on us with every available gun on
land and sea, and for three days and
nights without a moment's cessation
and with redoubled fury, they hurled
upon us, 8, 10 and 15-inch Ehells at
the rate of about fifty a minutel The
boom of the guns and the roar of .
bursting shells" and the hammering
and battering upon the fort were aw-'
f ul, deafening and horrifying. Before
it had gone on for twenty-four hours
every gxra in the fort had been dis
mounted and the parapet , torn and
shot to pieces. The troops were all
crowded into the bomb-proof, except
a few that we had to keep out on the
parapet as sentinels. These were re
lieved every thirty minutes, unless as
was often the case, the shells of the
enemy had put them off of duty for
ever. The bodies of those shot off the
parapet while on duty, if killed, lay
out on the ground, for to attempt to
bury them would only result in the
death or wounding of those sent out
to perform that duty. When the of
ficer wenf out with - men to relieve
those on duty, he would often find the
place vacant and the dead body of the
sentinel lying below on the ground. If
ha was only wounded an effort would
be made to get him Into the Iomb

cessfully done. The bomb-proof wa.i

and encased and covered with sand
and turf about twelve or fifteen feet
