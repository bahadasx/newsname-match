GOVERNOR CAPPER
INDORSES OTIS L BENTON
In the Sixth District Tour the Popular
Governor Urges the Election of a
Republican Congress to Support
Hughes
In Governor Capper's speeches
throughout the Sixth District he
urges the voters to support Otis L.
Benton for Congress in the following
manner.
"I want to say a few words here in
regard to 3-our Republican nominee
for Congress. I congratulate you peo
ple of the Sixth District upon the
tine prospects you have or senaing a
Republican congressman to Washing
ton and I congratulate you, also, up
on the calibre of the Republican you
have an opportunity to send. lie is
of real congressional timber.
I have known Otis L. Benton for
the last thirty years. - I remember
the first time I ever saw him. fie
was a poor boy who had come to Top-.
ka to get a job so he could earn
money with which to pay his wav
through college. He got the job,
that of a newspaper carrier, and he
got his college education. He im
pressed me then as a young man who
had the right kind of stuff in him,
and he has demonstrated since that
I was right in my judgment.
I have watched the career of Otis
Benton, as a successful business man
and as a fine citizen, with pride and
satisfaction.
He knows and appreciates theeo
ple of the Sixth District, among
whom he has lived for so man? years,
as ..few men know and appreciate
them. He knows the needs of this
district and what is expected of , a
representative in Washington. Otis
Lk Benton is highly qualified to rep
resent this big, forward looking, pros
perous district in Congress."

CITIES CAIN. COUNTRY LOSES
The figures of the Kansas State
Tax Commission for ' 1915 show that
while during the previous 12-month
period real estate values in the cities
of Kansas increased nearly six mil
lion dollars, farm land values in the
state of Kansas during the same pe-;
riod decreased a little more than six
hundred and thirty thousand dollars.
City values increasing farm values
decreasing. A survey made recently
by the Missouri State University cov
ering 650 farms, showed farm land
in two miles of a good town, worth
$73 an acre; in four miles, $70; in six
miles, $60; in eight miles, $58; and
farms a greater distance from a good
town ran down to $55 an acre. These
figures show that location has some
thing to do with farm land values.
A farm near a good town has greater
value; farther away, less, value. A
farm near a dead town may possess
no greater value than a farm, a long
way from-agood town. Move a' farm
away from a good town, its value
shrinks. Kill the town, the same
thing happens to the farm its value
shrinks. The farm has been remov
ed. It is not near a good town. The
people of Kansas are sending out of
the state 20 million dollars a year to
buy at retail goods which could be
bought at 'a fair price in the state
Loss of business will kill a town,
When a town dies it loses in popula
tion. Two hundred and ninety-four
Kansas towns and villages lost in
population during a 12-month period
ending 1915. When a town loses busi7
ness and population the farms around
that town are pretty likely to shrink
a little in value. The demand for
these farms Is not so great. Men like
to buy land near a good town not
near a dead one. Real estate in the
larger cities of Kansas is increasing
in population because they are doing
mo. e business. Many Kansas country
towns are losing in population be
cause they are doing less business
Business they should be doing is gc-
mg to large cities outside our own
state. And the Kansas community
builder should not forget that loca
tion has something to do with land
values (Copyright 1916.)
y TRIPLETS
Ross Tannyhill of Lanark township
has a cow that gave birth to triplet
calves. They are now nearly two
weeks old and be says they are all
just doing fine. At the price cattle
are at the present time a cow of this
kind is almost worth its weighs ia
gold. Ross says that if tie had just
a few such cows as this one it would
not be long until he could travel in
the same class with Rockefeller
Stockton He view.
C W. Miller, Republican candidate
for state senator, was in Sherman
county mixing with the voters last
Monday and Tuesday. He spent most
of the day Tuesday in Goodland get
ting acquainted with the people. He
is meeting with flattering prospects
and there is little doubt of his elec
tion. Mr. Miller came to Ellis county
years ago as the pooiest of the poor
but he has made a success of farming
add is one of the substantial men of
bis county.-. When be started out for
himself as a boy he worked for a far
mer for the sum. of $3 a month, but
on account of his industry his rise
was rapid. The voters can make no
mistake in supporting C. W. Miller,
of Hays, for state senator The Sher

SOME GOOD REASONS
The Democratic politicians are
placing all their hopes for the defeat
of Otis L. Benton for congress upon
just two propositions. First, that lie
is a banker; Second,, that be has been
financially successful. We surmise
that at the must opportune time the
district will be flooded, with litera
ture exploiting these two themes and
these Democratic politicians are san
guine in the belief that enough votes
will be thusly prejudiced to encom
pass Mr. Benton's defeat. A little
cool headed thinking will enable fair
minded voters to see that neither of
these two propositions should out
weigh the. many very urgent reasons
why Mr. Benton should be elected.
In the first place a banker requires
a very high order of character and
integrity to maintain public confi
dence. A crooked banker runs a very
short race for banking is based on
confidence, and the confidence of the
public- would soon be destroyed : by
any lack of integrity and personal
honor. And out here in the west
where prosperity and values fluctuate
between such wide margins it re
quires an unusual degree of conserva
tive foresight to manage a bank suc
cessfully. That Mr. Benton ' has
through all the years of fat and lean
prosperity managed bin bank suocess
fally and at the same time held a
firm grip on public confidence should
prove Mm to be a man ' whose Integ
rity and personal honor is not ud
should not be in question ia this
campaign. ....
As to Mr. Benton's financial suc
cess it matters not to the Democratic
politicians that he came to Decatur
county as a mere boy with naught
V - si
but two willing hands and started life
for himself. The political opponents
of Mr. Benton while not saying it in
so many words will infer that Mr.
Benton's wealth has been acquired
by the skinning process, by robbing
unfortunate widows and by foreclo
sure, of mortgages in years of crop
failures. Is o voter needs to be prej
udices by such insinuations if he will
stop to think that conditions in De
catur countvhave been the same
conditions as have prevailed in this
and other western Kansas counties
and we all know that no man could
acquire wealth here in such a man
ner and maintain the confidence of
the public. Men have grown wealthy
here on farms and in every line of
business where they possessed the
sagacity and controlled the means
for taking advantage of the opportu
nities as tbey presented themselves.
Mr. Benton's wealth has been ac
quired through the legitimate chan
nels pf trade and speculation and
along the same lines that each and
every one of us have acquired what
we possess. Some stories were start
ed against Mr. Benton during the
campaign and in every instance Mr.
Benton branded them as fabrications
and challenged any responsible per
son to get behind the charges. These
campaigh canards should have no
weight with any person who has
the best interests of his country at
heart. At this stage of political de
velopment the election of the Repub
lican candidates, Hughes and Fair
banks, seems as certain as such
events lean ever be foretold. The
country is looking to the Republican
party for a safe return to permanent
prosperity.' Business has' floundered
through a fictitious war prosperity
from without and a paralyzing inter
nal strife of strikes within until it
doesn't know whether on the morrow
its nose will be in the ground or up
in a balloon. It would be political
folly, to give Hughes a smashing ma
jority as all indications . now - point
and then tie his hands with a Demo
cratic congress. - Every Hughes vote
should be a Benton vote and no trivi
al insinuations should be allowed to
interfere with a broad view and pur
pose Hill City Republican.

10, 1916 Cattle sold about steady to
day on the rank and file, fancy Mis
souri fed S. M. S. yearlings it $11, as
compared with' $10.75 for their mates
last week, showing strength on prime
finished cattle. Receipts were 20,000,
a moderate Tuesday run, and light
supplies are slated for balance of the
week, wnich should mean a firm
market. .
Beef Cattle Heavy steers sold at
$10.60, same notch .as their mates
sold in yesterday, and the $11 year
lings were a quarter higher than
their mates brought on the two latest
shipments previously. - Short fed
grass steers sold around $9.25 for the
best here, and-pretty good grassers
brought $8 to $8.50, medium weight
ligh steers downward to $6.75, a few
thin- Northern grazed Texas steers

steady, although the market averages'
fully steady on thin cattle and fe d
ers. Stock heifers sell up to $3, none
of the fancy kind here this week.
Feeders sell up to $7.90, fair to good
ones $7 to $7. 2a, plain thin steers
down to $6.50;
Hogs Opening - prospects favored
lower -prices, but packers quickly
changed the outlook, competing keen
ly from the start, paying up to $9.80.
An border buyer had an order for
choice medium weights with an $9.80
limit, and the answer to his wire
that he could not get them was to
remove the limit and '-go and get
them." That wire resulted in a late
sale at $9.90, J15 cents above top else-
w-fc" --.oa the Missouri river today,
foOowrng smarglrr of ; 20centa yes
terday above other Missouri River
markets oh iop price. Receipts were
14,000 head, a drop of one-third from
receipts last VTuesday, and the com
bination effective" today points
strongly to good markets 'ahead.
Sheep and Lambs Receipts were
17,000 head, but packers orders were
urgent and opening sales of just fair
lambs at $10.25 were counted 25 cents
higher. Later the market quieted,
and better lambs sold at $10.25, these
10 to 15 cents higher. Texas sent
yearlings at $8.85, and 48 lb feeding
lambs at $9.80, and Arizona sent fat
lambs $9 90. Fat ewes are worth $7 to
$7.35. Choice western feeding lambs
sell around $10. The market is 50 to
75 cents above a week ago in all de
partments. Receipts are larger than
they were last week, and a gooa run
through October is assured.

THE RECORD SLIPPED
The Democratic papers of the dis
trict are trying to get some consola
tion out of the bill of expense filed by
Mr. Benton in Washington. This is
a requirement or law ana was com
plied witn in a fair and conscientious
manner. The amount expenaea
came far. under the limit of the law
which seemed -a surprise to our 'Dem
ocratic brethern. The opposition
lost no time in "grabbing" this state
ment as soon as it was filed thinking
to eet some valuable thunder, but
alas? The strange thing of it all was.
that when a search was made for the
expense bill -filed by Mr. Oormeriy two
years ago and four years ago, they
had disappeared from the files.. JNow
the facts are it pays to be "in," and
Mr. Connelly seems to know how to
take every advantage of being "in
Honesty and fairness hurts no one
and it would looked better for Mr.
Connelly to have left his expense bill
containing amount of money expend,
ed and postoffice promises made, on
file, than to have none af all when
the law requires that they shall be
