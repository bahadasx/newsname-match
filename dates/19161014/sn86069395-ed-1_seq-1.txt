EDITORIAL COMMENT. f
L Yesterday was Friday the 13th,
but it was almost a perfect autumn
rlTom Underwood, Jim West and
glesby Soyars, all on their first trip,
Irfrfine work and were always ready
fften called upon.
At Olmstcad several old Confeder
ates were met who were still talking
about tlte royal reception given the
Orphans' Brigade last month.
TheElkton Times has suspended
publication in order to adjust certain
differences between the partners, H.
R. Roper and Geo. S. Weathers.
Judce Bush has a list of appoint
ments in Trigg county three days of
next week, two days of the time
Congressman Barkley will be with
him.
It is planned to have the successor
of the late Joseph H. Kastle, superior
of the U. of K. Experiment Station,

College of Agriculture.
Sulphur, Ky., was partly swept by
fire that originated in the cupola of
the Baptist church there yesterday
afternoon. The loss is estimated at
between $15,000 and $20,000.
The crowd was a little too large for
good work, as it was at times unwieldy
and strung out along many miles of
road. Twenty cars with about 60
jjd boosters can do the best work.
Remarriage of divorced persons
whose mates still live was opposed in
a proposed change in the canons of
the Protestant Episcopal Church, dis
cussed at length at the St. Louis con-
n ventioa
The October crop report issued by
Commissioner of Agriculture Mat S.
Cohen, chronicles a remarkably good
tobacco crop, with livestock and pas
tures in generally good condition and
the potato crop below average.
Everywhere the Boosters went
they found a most kindly feeling to
wards Hopkinsville. All of the busi
ness men found some of their patrons,
even in the remote towns visited.
These visits to the surrounding towns
are doing great good. Let's keep
them up until all adjoining counties
have been visited.
At Tntlianonolis. where he was
greeted by large crowds, President
Wilson, speaking chiefly on good
roads, declared in reply to the Re
publican chanre that the Democratic
party is a sensational party that "any
jnan who revives the issue of section
alism in this country is unworthy of
the confidence of the nation.
Our sister towns of Russellville and
Elkton did the handsome thing and
not a particle of jealousy was shown.
The speakers were careful to explain
that the object was n?t to take trade
from local stores, but to tell about
our wholesale markets that were be
ing built up for the surrounding
country.

Twenty-nine cars fitted with
Boosters pulled out at seven o'clock
Thursday mornintr on a run "of 117
miles through South Christian, Todd
and Logan counties. There were
more than 100 men in the part'.
The first stop was at Pembroke at
the early hour of 7:45, where H. H.
Abernathy and T. C. Underwood
spoke to 100 people of the early
risers. S. A. Powell had prepared
the Opera House but the stop was too
brief to leave the cars.
The weather was fine and a short
run brought them to Trenton, where
Mayor Gaines had brought together a
crowd of 400. Speeches were made
there by H. H. Abernathy, Chas. M.
Mcacham W. R. Howell and W. O.
Soyars, after which Mayor Gaines
told them how glad Trenton was to
have the visitors present. At this
point young Soyars made his maiden
speech as a booster and instantly
made good. After that he was
shoved to the front as one of the reg
ular and heavy workers.
Guthrie was reached by a wide de
tour owing to a broken-up road but a
big crowd estimated at 500 was wait
ing and was addressed by Clark, Un-
derwood, Soyars and Howell.
The next stop was at Hadensville
where Jesse Evans had gathered a
and K. b. Cooper maue tne only
speech during the brief stop. On to
Aliensville was a quick run and here
a cordial welcome was given. At
least 500 people were ussembled and
Meacham and Cooper. Rev. Mr.
Rowo'coiicluded the speaking, telling
' how glad Aliensville was to receive a
call from Hopkinsville business men.
' Olmstcad was reached just before
'noon and the Crowd of 100 or more
, people Were found assembled on the
i'mpus of the beautiful now' school

Clark, Meacham and JaS. West.
At the little station of Ferguson
about 50 people were present and L.
E. Foster made the only speech.
Tho next stop was Cave Spring and
here the only mix-up of tho entire
trip occurred. A part of the crowd
took the wrong road and only six cars
got to the place Where 200 peoplo
were waiting. Clark, West andj
Cooper did tho speaking. 1
At Russellville all got together again.'
and found 500 or 600 people on thej
public square, ihcluding'the studeiitsj
spoke while others we& "swW aot din

But
brads' band and welcomed by Judge
Edwards in a cordial speech. The
addresses were made byCIark, West,
Underwood, Soyars, Fowler and
Howell.
Orily a part of the crowd made the
12-mile trip to Lewisburg, beyond
Russellville. Two new cars joined
the party here and some returned
home from Russellville.
The Lewisburg people had pre-
parea one of the best receptions of
the day and at least 500 people had
waited patiently an hour's delay.
The Boosters were received with a
glad hand. Little girls witli baskets
of flowers met the cars and furnished
everybody with button-hole bouquets.
A young man whose name the Ken-
tuckian representative failed to learn
delivered a nice welcome address
when Master of Ceremonies Clark in
troduced as the speakers Underwood,
Cooper and Soyars, all of whom made
good talks.
Leaving Russellville a part of tho
crowd led by W. R. Howell made
the Daysville appointment at 5:30 p.
m., where Col. Howell made a speech
to 75 people and made an extra stop
at-Fairview and spoke to auotlicr
crowd of 75 that insisted on being
boosted.
The main party after making
Lewisburg returned to Russellville
and making good time over the fine
new pike readied Gordonsville for
a night meeting. Here was gathered
about 100 people" at the Edwards
store, though many had left. A good
little me'eting was held with Meacham
and Abernathy doing the talking.
Rev. Win. Golf then took the stand
and made a fine talk, thanking the
boosters for coming and praising
Hopkinsville and her people.
The main crowd stopped briefly at
Daysville, where Howell had spoken
early in the evening.
The last point, Elkton, was
reached at 7 p. m., and the crowd
here was very fine. On the beauti
ful public square, 700 or 800 people
were congregated. Claude Clark
started the ball to rolling and Lucian
Lindsay made an address of welcome.
Those who spoke for the Boosters
were Meacham, Abernathy, West and
Underwood. This meeting was a
splendid finale to a day of strenuous
exertion.
At many of the stops the "Band"
put on musical numbers and Frank
Southall did some minstrel stunts that
kept everybody in a good humor.
The run from Elkton home was
without incident. The crowd virtu
ally broke up and the cars came in as
they, chose the last getting home
about ten o'clock.
It was a great trip, too much for one
day, but every point billed was made
and the thousands of people spoken
to appeared to nclmiro the pluck of
Hopkinsville's business men who
would 'undotfake so much in one
day.

INTEREST IS
INCREASING
Revival at Cumberland Pres
byterian Church Being
Largely Attended.
The revival at the Cumberland
Presbyterian church continues to grow
in interest from time to time. Wed
nesday night Rev. Courtlier spoke to
a much larger audience than on Tues
day night. The singing was very
much improved.
Notwithstanding the various attrac
tions in the city Thursday night, the
attendance was the largest since the
beginning of the revival.
Dr. Courtncr's subject for the
evening was the world and tne
Church.,' He used as a scripture
lesson I Kings 10 1-13, taking the visit
of the queen of Sheba to Solomon as
the basis of his subject. Comparing
the queen to the world and Solomon
to the church. He spoke at length of
the queen's visit from a geographical
and a financial standpoint. He spoke
of some of the hardships the queen
underwent in reaching Solomon that
she might ask him many hard ques
tions.
Dr. Courtner is a very earnest
speaker and seemingly has at his com
mand at all times such passages o
Scripture as will confirm his state
ments, quoting them from memory
and always telling his congregation
where the passage quoted may be
found.
His subject lor last night was
"Heartfelt Religion," or is it possible
to know for a certainty that you are
truly regenerated?
So far Dr. Courtner has made no
propositions for membership and his
remarks have been confined more
especially to tlio church.
