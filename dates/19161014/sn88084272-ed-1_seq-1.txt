SENATOR FALL HAS RECIPE
TO MAKE PEACE IN THEXICO
Denver. Colo., Oct H. Senator A. B.
Fall of New Mexico, addressing a large
crowd here Friday night, declared
that all that is necessary to restore
peace In Mexico is to tell the Amer
icans to go back to their properties
in Mexico and protect them.
Speaking of American interests In
Mexico, senator Fall declared they
over-balanced those of the Mexicans
themselves, though the Mexicans owned
the most of the land. He accused
president Wilson of suppressing in
formation regarding Mexico, saying he
called stories which came out of there
"alarmist reports."
"But he indicted "-Is own administra
tion when ho became angered at Car
ratua and on June 2i sent him a note
corroborating every alarmist report
sent out of Mexico." the senator con

To Teach All About Crops.
The exposition was created to ehovr
the world how to raise crops; bow to
harvest them, to store them, to market
them: how to raise cattle and other
liiestoek. and how to market them:
to show the world tue last word in
farm machinery: in farm implements.
and automobiles: to display the world
products of scientific agriculture: in
a word, to teach the world effective
and profitable farming. These are the
objects of the exposition which opens
its gates to the world tonight
Thousand at AVorfc.
More than a thousand persons are
working in the buildings and grounds
of the exposition this afternoon, in

have appeared of a sudden: grains
which have been blown by the. winds

waving in sheaves beneath the pergo

of a sinsrle nicht.
Number Underestimated.
With the closing hours of prepara
tion, it has been found that the num
ber of exhibits has been underestimat
ed, and that more room will be need
ed. More than 500 individual entries
of grains, fruits, and other farm prod
ucts had been made at an early hour
this morning, and many, many more
are expected before the entries close.
This exceeds the estimates by far. and
shows that farreaching interest In the
exposition has been created through
out the United States. The space in
the counties building to be devoted to
individual exhibits may have to be en
larged Sunday to accommodate all the
entries
l.oenl DUplays Come In.
A number of local industrial and
commercial displays have come In at
the last moment and it is feared by
B. K. Hanafourde, director of the ex

to be refused. A few days ago it was
