A spirit of ' unanimity and conn
dence was dominant this noon at the
probate convention for the district of
Bridgeport. , Henry - P. Lyons, the
prominent yuuns auorney ui.iuio i"-,
was nominated for judge of probate.
The manner in which the delegates
look forward to the balloting election

dresses of the delegates, which were
overflowing with pleasure at the
splendid record of Democracy in gen
eral during the last. few years, and
with confidence for the outcome of
the elections. ' .'
. Attorney Lyos was honored by
having his name placed 'before the
convention " by Judge Morris B
Beardsley, candidate for governor of
Connecticut. . - (
The convention : began at
o'clock and on the motion of Alder
man Daniel Harrigan, , John H. Can-
dee of JEaston was unanimously
named chairman, after George Cough-
lin had opened the meeting. On the
motion' of Alderman William J.
Moran, John H. Casey was made-sec
retary.
V Judge' Beardsley was accepted as s
proxy for John P. Kemple bf the First
district, and Lawrence E. Moran for
Frank! J. Mollaney ofnhe Ninth. Cor
nelius" Donnelly of the Second, John
H. Grant of the Fourth, Sigmund
HIrschberg of the Seventh, Thlmas C.
Carroll of ; the Eleventh, J. H.
O'Rourke -and ' William Callan, dele-
gatns-at-large, were not-present.
When nominations were called ror,
.tii dire neardslev arose and said: "Gen
tlemen, I have a pleasant duty to per
form. I'm perfectly able to say what
I'm going to say, but in thesei times,
when; what you say is likely to be mis
represented, Td rather have it down
In black and white," '
Reading from a manuscript,: Judge
Beardsley then nominated Mr. Lyons,
amid great acclaim. His speech fol-
lOWSt-'-.vi". ;
"We have met to place In nomina
tion th m?in whbm f e wish shall be
the judgC of the Bridgeport probate
court for the coming two years. The
filling of this position is one of the
most ' important duties devolving on
the voters of this community In No
vember; Every . court is important.
and it behooves us to see that in all
of them are judges' capable and
honest. The probate court from Its
very nature answers all of the people
more vitally than any other. -: It has
jurisdiction over infants and helpless
ones, must protect their property and
safeguard . their persona Death in
vades every family, rich an"d poor,
high and low," and through thiVcourt
goes at least once in every generation

trict. It Is evident that, the man to
preside oyer sueh a tribunal must be
one carefully chosen, a man learned
in the particular law applying to mat
ters which come before him. - A man
of good sense, for not all of the law is
to be found .in the. books, a great deal
is left to his discretion. . .
"A short time ago the Republican
party- renominated the present judge,
Mr. Miller, and Judge Pullman, their-t
silver tongued orator, in placing his
name before . the convention, .drew a
picture, of what he thought the man
should be, anT I fully agree with him,
and have one who measures up to the
requirements, Ke must have a sound
knowledge of the law, common sense,
be honest, tactful, courteous, yet firm
to maintain his position when once
taken ' . The gentleman whdm1 shall
name possesses, all . of these qualities.
He has had experience. ' For four
years under Judge Hallen he was the
chief' clerk in the office,' and during
the regrettable' illness of th)?- judge al
most the entire care of the office fell
to him. He is a Bridgeort boy, born
and reared in our Second district.

schools; of Niagara University,' and of
the Tale Law School. . .' -
'I take great pleasure in placing In
nomination for the office of judge of
the Bridgeport probate district Mr.
Henry 'P. Lyons." .
Frederick , C. Mullins then arose
and In seconding the nomination said:
'The gentlemen of this convention
have nominated a man from .this side
of the river, and I'm on the other side
of the creek. . It Is a source of very
great pleasure to me, however, . that
tbw Is so, because I have known this
young man all his life and his father
before him, and J . know that his
character and Democracy cannot be
assailed."-'--

automobile at Main and Fulton
streets and the latter came off second
best. One) of the front wheels of the
car was torn off. It was owned by

Walker. Witnesses, disagreed as to
who was to blame for the collision.
('The annual inspections of both po

President Wilson wrote to Governr
Whitman in answer to a letter from
the New Tork executive regarding the
New Tork militia organizations on the

man likelihood have been followed by
fresh aggressions from Mexico upon

of the Uunlted States."
In his letter, the President paid
tribute to the character of the militia
men and denied that any organizations
were being kept on the border to per

"My Dear Governor Whitman: '- I
have received, your letter of Sept.. 20
and have taken up with the Secretary
of war the situation as it affects the

difficulty which necessitated the call
for the militia, I have been deeply sen
sitive of the inconvenience caused to
the members of these citizen military
organizations by their separation from
their families and from their ordinary

In order to minimize -these sacri
