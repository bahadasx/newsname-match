. Governor
Henry D. Hatfield last
night addressed two record-breaking
r" meetings at Monongah and Wortblngton.
He was accompanied to these
two places by a delegation of Republican
leaders from this city. Inspirit
ed by his meeting at Farmington the
' previous night, which broke the local
record for size anil enthusiasm,
Governor Hatfield was at his best last
night.
"If we ever had a larger meeting in
this place," said one of tho oldest
citizens at Worthlngton last night,
"it was a meeting back in 1876 and I
have my doubts as to whether that
was larger than this one. I attended
the meeting In 1876."
Every available Inch of space was
occupied In the theatre and more
**. would have heard the governor had
there been a larger hall. At Monongah
every Beat was occupied and many
| had to stand At both places the audlences
listened with rapt attention.
> At Monongah the governor was only
permitted to speak about thirty minutes
because of the later meeting at
Worthlngton. The audience pleaded
with him to remain and as he left
the hall to catch his car every one
rose and cheered him as he elbowed
his way to the door. Following the
close of his address at Worthlngton
where he spoke for more than an hour
and a half, and where he was nre
ceded by Hon. Emmet Showalter In
an hour's address on'National affairs.
I the big crowd moved to the platform
and shook the governor's hand.
Tm a Democrat," said a healthy
^looking toiler, "hut I know my friends
' and I'm going to vote for them I'm
going to vote for Judge Robinson and
L/-, there are several more friends of the
laboring man on that ticket that I'm
1 .going to vote for."
"If there is anything I have not
made clear in reporting to you my
stewardship of the past three and onehalt
years. 1 want you to ask me. It
there is anything I have not told you
or have not answered to Jlour entire
satisfaction I am here to answer
It I can," said the governor at the close
of his Worthington speech. No questions
were propounded to him.
The Monongnh meeting waB presid >
ed over by Lloyd Kuhn and after the
governor had left to go to Worthington.
Rollo Conley. candidate for prosecuting
attorney, and W. H. Veach,
| Candidate for sherff. addressed the asy
sembled voters.
Dr. W. W. Orr was the chairman
of the Worthington Rally and the governor
waB Introduced by Hon. E. M.
Showalter of this city. The governor's
speech at both places waB direct and
forceful exposition reviewing his ad.
.ministration, and answering with conJfi
vinclng effect every charge that Cornwell,
Boss Watson's candidate, has
made against the state government
"Mr. Cornwell." Governor Hatfield
i Mid, "baa been saying that the direct
- levy de reduced this year from fourg
teen cents to nine cents, but that the
' valuations would be sufficiently boostr
ed to make up the difference in the
amount of revenue. I havo had cornea
plied the assessments returned from
every county in the state this year,
and I found that, the taxes on the in'
crease in valuation of the year 191>i
from 1915, amount to less than eight
thousand dollars for the state, based
I on the nine-cent levy.
! "Now, the states receives less than
eight thousand dollars from Increased
^valuation of all property, but by the
decrease of the direct levy from fourteen
cents to nine cents, it has reduced
its revenue for state and state
ft; school purposes noarly six hundred
(thousand dollars.
"Mr. Cornwell says, to fool the public,
that the increase in valuation,
mind you, amounting to less than
f. , r,eight thousand dollars in revenue, will
|J'?i balance the decrease in revenue of
' nearly six hundred thousand dollars.
What can we expect from a candidate
> who would attempt to make the peoi
pie believe such statements ?"
?> Referring to the publlcatlin in
iv Democratic newspapers that watch
" fobs had appeared In the southern
part of the state bearing the picture
of Governor Hatfield, and wording to
the effect that he was a candidate for
t - United States Senator, Governor Hats'
field said that he knew nothing about
k this, and believes that it was a plot
of his Democratic enemies. "The first
ii I knew of this," said the Governor,
"was when Major Joe Chilton handed
me one In the lobby of a Charleston
hotel. I do not ltnow what Is behind
this, but I have my suspicions, and you
oan draw your own conclusions. I
1 am not a candidate for that office
|. or any other office, and there Is nothing
In the way of official appointment
? in this state that can now interest
I? me. I expect to return to the practice
of my profession as I have time
and again said, with a feeling In my
i. heart that I have kept the faith with
if the people, kept the pledges of the

iNfcW YORK, N. Y.. Oct. 14.?ine
Hughes Alliance today received the
signed enrollment 01 Scott S. Wolf, a
Democrat, ot Fremont, Ohio, who
states that he lias just completed his
second term as Democratic Central
Jommltleemau from the second ward
3f Fremont "1 refuse to run again as
I cannot support i'resldent Wilson at
ill" Mr. Wolf staled adding "after
serving for years in the Ohio National
Duard and su view of the way in which
iur boys have been handled in Mexi10.
how could X vote for Wilson."
From two sources tbe Xlughes Alliance
received reports that many Democrats
in Kentucky ure at work for
Dovernor Hughes. William 1>. Mcfay,
of l'rcstonburg wrote "through
this section there is a growing sentiment
tor tho Republican ticket among
ill classes and 1 And that a number
3f Democrats will vote for Mr. Hughes
but reruse to go on record for the
reason that they wish to retualu in the
Democratic party in the county elections"
Mr. William Abner ol Lebanon
wrote "there are a great many Democrats
here who will not support Wilson."
Replying to the attack made upon
him by President Wilson in the course
31 his speech at Shadow Lawn last
Saturday, Robert Bacon has address9d
the following open letter to Mr.
Wilson: "Sir in your capacity of caniidate

State who honored me with their votps
it the recent primaries. With the Indention
of making it appear that my
:ondidacy for the Republican Senatorial
nomination was suppored by men
who would involvo this country in war,
ro uspoke of me as "a man whose
ivowed position in respect of international
aftairs was unneutral and whose
intention was, if he became a member
)f great council upon international
affairs at Washington to promote the
interest of one side in tbe present war
In Europe and you argued that it tbe
Republican party should succeed, one
very large branch of it would Insist
upon a reversal from peace to war.
The statement that it was my intention
it elected Senator to promote "tbe
Interests of one side in the present
war in Europe," and thereby violate
my oath of office, is beneath contempt.
My respect for tbe office of President
of the United States prevents me from
characterizing Buch a statement as it
deserves. 1 leave the judgment of its
falsity to the public. Either you have
not read what I have said many times
publicly on the subject of our neutrality,
or you have deliberately misstated
my attitude in an attempt to raise a
false issue. With the accurate, care
fullv pnnHlrlorprl arralimniftiit
foreign policy by Mr. Hughes, Mr
Roosevelt, and Mr. Root, 1 am proud ic
agree. In your anger and desperation
as the ring of truth closeB in about
you, you seem to be trying to make a
false Issue. You say that your reelec
lion means peace, and that Mr. Hughes
election means war. Of course
nothing could be further from the
truth. It is Inconceivable that a Pres
ldent of the United States should sc
Insult tho intelligence of the American
people. The statement that a large
number of your fellow citizens because
they condemn your weak, vacillating
policy, wish to plunge this country intc
the horrors of a war, is preposterous.
The contention that you or the Demo
cratlc administration have kept this
country out of wur is specions and un
founded in fact. Vacillation, timidity
weakness in asserting our rights, inability
to perform our duties, confusion
of words, a constant change of at
tltude threats unsupported can not
possibly keep this nation or any oth
cr out of wur. It is the fear of thouse
who will vote against you that suet
conduct of our forolgn affairs will in
ovitably lead ub into war. A strong,
determined, clear policy Insures peace
It is unworthy to assert that a large
number of your followmen, American:
of undivided allegiance, of whole faith,
of BUbllme trust in the honor and
righteousness of their country, wolud
seek to plunge the Uhited States lntc
the horrors of war. Such a statement
you must know to be falso. If a mil
lion votes were to be yours for making
such a misstatement, If you believed il
to be the only way to win a dospcratt
cause, you should scorn so to misrep
resent the people of a country whict
has elected you to Its highest place
of trust. The issues of this campaigr
are vital to the welfare of the nation
I appeal to you, sir, as a candidate
for the highest office, to present thi
issues squarely and fairly to the peo
pie and abide by their decision with
out stooping to inflame the prejudice!

worthily to Impugn the motives or tc

sure the Republican leaders will have
no cause to regret the report that will
