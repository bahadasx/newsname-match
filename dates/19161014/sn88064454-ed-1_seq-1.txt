Church Fair a Success
The Church Fair last Sunday
was a success in every way, the
weather was ideal, the people well
disposed to spend a good (lay. the
committees having fullfilled their
parts well, and every thling was in
the best to accommodate and en
tertain the large crowd that was on I
the ground from the opening to
the closing.
The splendid Broussard Brass
Baud and the Isle Labbe band re
inforced by some members from
Loreauville furnished tine music
during the day and night and we
must say they were. liberal with
their music and the people of St.
Martinville and the management
of the fair well appreciated the
music so gracefully offered without
compensation.
The fancy works donated for
this fair made a fine exhibit of art
and the wheels tiat disposed of
these fine pieces were liberally pa
tronized as well as all other attrac
tion and tables, and we must say
everything served was the best, -
the cooking was PAR EXCELLANCE
acid the service the best.
At night the gumbo and euchre
were well patronized and the suc
cess of this fair surpassed thoseg
given in previous years. The gross
amount realized was $1070.
Forget Your Aches
Stiff knees. achiug limbs, lame back
make life burden. If you suffer from
rheumatism. gout, lumbago, neuralgia.
get a bottle of Sloau's Liniment. the
universal remedy for pain. Easy to ap
ply; it penetrates without rubbing sad
soothes the tender flesh. Cleaner and
more effective than mussy ointments or
D poultices. For strains or sprains, sore
p muscles or wrenched ligaments result
lug from strenuous exercise. Sloan's Li
niment gives quick relies. Keep it on
hand for emergencies. At your drug
gist. 25c.
Foot Ball Game.
There was a game of foot ball in
Jeanerette last Saturday between
the Jeanerette and St. Martinville
High School teams, which resulted
in a tie. The boys on both side
played hard to win, but the best
they could do was to prevent the
other side from winning. Anoth
er game will be played here soon,
when it is expected that our boys
will do up Jeanerette.
Clean Bad Skin From Within
Pimply, muddy. comeplexlous are due
to impurities in the Ilowd. ('lear up
the skin by taking Dr. King's New Life
Pills. Their mild laxativs qualities re
Lmove the poisons from the systemu and
brighten the 'ye. A full, free, non -grip
u lug bowel movement in thel mornilng is
fthe reward ,of a (los of Ilr. King's New
nt Life Pills the night before. At your
druggist. 25c.
- The sugar wills art' all acout
Sready and the cane growers are .all
. getting things ready to comenlneie
operation the coming week and_
next. Th|' cane crop is large and
ut.e of t.l mi-nlls will have toopwrl-:
ate more than two months. Fall
planting has beenl general during
the Ipast few days aed wiedrowiCg
for seed is now going ,ce rapidly,
though some planters tliink the
ground dry for winlrowing.
It is hard to work. but harder to
'ic ur.- w ,rk and remain respecta
