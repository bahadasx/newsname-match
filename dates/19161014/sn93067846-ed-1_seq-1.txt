LEADEN MONEY IN CIRCULATION
YOCNO MAN BOUND OVER AS
COUNTERFEITER.
Given Preliminary With Secret Ser?
vice Operative Pressing- Charge?-J.
D. Til you of Florence la Defendant.
Columbia, Oct. 11.?J. D. Tllyou, a
young white man of Florence, was
brought before Beverly 81<?an, United
States commissioner, yesterday for a
preliminary hearing on a charge of
having passed counterfeit money.
Francis II. Weston, United States dig* |
trict attorney, and V v IS. Thomas,
a secret service operativ?, ulleged
that last Saturday Tllyou parsed two
counterfeit specie dollars In stores In
Colum bia. Tllyou was be und over
to November federal court and bond
set at 11,000. /
Mrs. A. B. Howard, who runs a
store on Pulaskl street, swjre that a
man fitting the description of Tllyou
came Into her place last Saturday
night and made a I? cent purchase,
tendering a specio dollar In payment.
She said that she gave hin, 95 cents
In change and he left. Mm. Howard
says that he or the man who was
with him then went Into the store of
Leila Wells, two doors aw iy. Leila
Wells swore that Tllyou she posi?
tively Identified him) cam i into her
store about the time Mis. Howard
says he left hers and made a 5 cent
purchase, and gave her a specie dol?
lar, and that she gave him 8 5 cents
In change. Both women swore that
they did not have a specie dollar In
their cash until they took in tho
counterfeit.
The exchange of th? money Is said
to have taken place about 9 o'clock
Saturday night. Shortly after that
Joe Wells, husband of Lei1 la, came
home and discovered the spurious dol?
lar. Pretty soon after that. Wells
gays, Tflydu and another man came
by their store and his wife said that
iTUyeu was the man who hnd given
little while after his wife ha 3 taken
In the lead foliar and that Soon Tll?
you came In and asked for a match.
Sunday morning Howard discovered
that he also had a lead dollar and he
and Wells laid the matter before Po?
liceman W. F. Ricks. Hicks called
Detective Strickland and they, upon
Leila Wells' identification, arrested
Tllyou. Chief of Police J. W. Rich?
ardson immediately bctran work on
the case, but decided that It was a
matter for the federal authorities,, so
he notified Secret Service Ofneer
Thomas of Charlotte, who immediate?
ly came to Columbia and took charge
of the case.
No testimony was put up for the
defense but It Is understood that
their contention will be that Tllyou is
not the man who passed the two dol?
lars. Tllysu was born at Florence
and has spent all his life In Florence
and vicinity. He and his family are
well known there.
During the trial the prosecution de?
cided to arrest also as an acomplice,
J. O. Dtrnlels, who Is said to have
been with Tllyou when the money was
passed, buv this was not done, upon
Daniels promising not to leave Co?
lumbia.
Tho two lead dollars, bearing date
of l*ftJ, were very poor Imitations.

Savannah, Ga., Oct. 10.?The pres
tce of a submarine off the Georgia
>ast this morning was unofficially
Sported to custom house authorities
fcnd the British consul at Savannah. |

Tho submarine was reported as be
big on the offshore side of Martin's

formation came from, although stress- '
tg the 1 fact that it was entirely un- |
Icial.
From other sources, however, It is
understood that the information came
the form of a wireless message
rom a ship at sea, picked up here
[onday afternoon. The message was
[being sent to Charleston, It Is under
tood, and reported the submarine,
ler decks slightly awash, apparently
[In waiting, as being off Martin's Indus?
try lightship. Her nationality could
foot be determined, nor could It be as?
certained whether she was armed.
Although the submarine was report
ted some miles off the coast, marine
[men pointed out tonight that the
'Georgia coast afforded several excel
>nt places where an undersea craft
imlght seek shelter and a place of
hiding. They mentioned Warsaw and
fOssabaw sounds, two bodies of water
>Seldom frequented by other than
pleasure craft. From either of these
sounds a small craft could proceed
further Inland by the Wilmington
[\rever from Warsaw and the Green and
Ogeechee rivers from Ossabaw.

Newport, Oct. 10.?The German
submarines which sank six ships Sun?

getaway. Although the British ami
French warships arc searching for the
raiders far out to sea, It is not believ?
ed they can be captured. It is now
practically certain that only two sub?
marines participated in the raid, U-5i
and U-61. The latter may have been
acting merely as supply ship for the
former. The crew of the Kingston

BROOKLYN DEVELOPS NECES?
SARY PUNCH AT HOME.
Red Sox Give Great Battle?Both
World Series Contenders Forced to
Cse Two Pitchers hi Third Contest.
New York, Oct. 10.?Firmly en?
trenched within their own grounds
tho Brooklyn Nationals turned upon
the Boston Americans today and j
wrested victory from the Bed Sox by
A score of 4 to 3 in the third game
of the world's series.
True to their predictions, the Su
perbas, playing at Kbbets field, prov?
ed far more formidable than when
under the spell of Boston's cold dis?
dain. Twice deprived of victories
after-thrilling battles ..t Braves field,
they finally arose in their might this
afternoon and with plaudits of the
i
home fans ringing in their ears they
batted out a victory with savage vig?
or, swinging their bludgeons with
such effectiveness that neither the
pitching staff nor che stonewall de?
fense of the Bed Sox could hold
them In check. Hits rang off their
bats with the snap and deadliness of
exploding shrapnel, and while the In?
vaders made a determined resistance,
they were forced to bow to the supe?
rior playing of the winners.
As a result of Brooklyn's triumph,
their supporters' joy and hopes reach?
ed great heights and the victory was
followed by one of the most extra
| ordinary celebrations over seen upon
a world's series battle field. Hardly
I had Stengel clutched Lewis' lowering
fly for the final out of the game,
than thousunds of rooters came troop?
ing onto the diamond and outfield
where they appeared to be carried
away with the enthusiasm of con?
quest.
Men and boys with here and there
feminine companions, capered and
danced about with joy, while the
bands were assembling for the march
|^^^^|||^^
gan a parade that grew in imitation
of the college snake dance, while
the more sedate of the spectators
cheered and yelled. Flags and ban?
ners were hurled onto the Held, fol?
lowed by cane seat cushions, until
the air was filled with flying objects.
Across the field, the Royal Rootors
of Boston, undaunted by defeat or by
the thousands of their rivals, struck
up the famous "Tessle" song and
march and soon the park was filled
with parading battalions. After a
number of manoeuvers the adherents
of the two clubs met In midfield and
after an interchanKe of cheers, good
naturcdly bombarded each other
with cushions.
The demonstration made up in part
for the lack of thrilling features which
lifted the first two contests of the se?
ries out of the ranks of ordinary base?
ball conflicts. There was missing in
the third game the tenseness and sen?
sational individual play which dom?
inated the clashes at Braves' field.
Brooklyn jumped Into the lead in
today's contest and was never headed,
although the Boston club crept up to
within a run of tying the score In the
closing innings. Neither was the
game marked by super excellent base?
ball, but Brooklyn won and with the
hope that the team would repeat to?
morrow, that was entirely sufficient
for their supporters. In contrast
with the Boston games, that of today
was played in opol, crisp weather and
overcoats . were necessary for comfort
to the spectators in all but the sunny
i
left field stands.
Jack Coombs, already a veteran of
two world's series with the Philadel?
phia Athletics, came in for unstinted
praise both for his splendid twirling
in the early Innings of the game and
later for his self abnegation in re?
questing to be relieved when he 'elt
himself slipping and realized that to
remain in the box might entail defeat
for his teammates.
Until the seventh inning Coombs
held the Bed Sox to six hits and two
runs, but when Larry Gardner lifted
the ball over the right tield wall for B
home run Coombs realized that he wa3
losing his cunning. His teammates
urged him to remain in the gams, but
ihe Kcnnebunk (Mc.) hurler was firm
n his determination and was Anally
?eplaced by Pfeffer, who held the one
run lead Coombs had given him until
he end, Boston being helpless and
lit less before his delivery.
Carl Mays, the underhand twirler
selected by Manager Carrigan to ho!:!

was unable to turn them into runs.
All told, Brooklyn got 10 hits for a
total of 14 bases, while Boston rolled
up an aggregate of 12 bases with
seven hits. m}\
Hooper, Shorten and Gardner were
the heavy batters for the lied Sox.
Hooper acquired two hits, one a triple;
Shorten, playing in his first world se?
ries, gathered three hits in four trips
to the plate and Gardner made his ono
hit count when he drove the ball over
the wall for a circuit trip.
Capt. Jake Daubert was the batting
star of the Superhas, collecting three
hits in four times at bat after going
tluough the lirst two games without,
connecting safely, His final blow eras
delivered In the sixth inning when
he drove the ball to the extreme end
of the left field foul line where LoUrfls
corralled it in a corner between two
bleacher^ stands.
Daubert was sprinting around sec?
ond when the fielder clutched the
sphere and had turned third when
Scott in deep short received the throw.
The latter Whipped it to Themas at
the plate just as Daubert slid in with
what he thought was a home run.
Umpire O'Doy, however, divide J
that the runner had not touched th<?
plate and the Brooklyn players and
fans roared their disapproval of the
decision without effect. Daubert w\is
given credit for a three base hit by
the official scorers and had to be sat
