Whitman but He Hopes for
Better Ttrings.
LONG BHANOT-N-j"' Oct. 14?
President Wilson in a letter to Gov
ernor Whitman, of New York, sent,
October 9, and made public here to- j
| day, declared that the emergency
which caused the sending of the
militia to tho Mexican border "un
happily still exists."
He added, however, that he believ
ed conditions in northern Mexico are,
improving and that "in the near fu-;
ture" it probably will be possible to'
do more than has been done to re
lieve the embarrassments under j
which organized militia regiments
have necessarily suffered.
President Wilson wrote to Govern
or Whitman in answer to a letter
from the New York executive regard
ing the New York militia organiza
I tlon on the border. The president j
(told Mr. Whitman it was impossible]
j to set a date on which the remaining j
j New York regiments there could bej
| released.
The president in his letter declared
| that he had been advised by the war j
| department that the withdrawal of
' the militia at any time since they had ?
been ordered to the bordpr would j
,have "in all human likelihood been!
followed by fresh aggressions from j
Mexico on the lives and property of'
people of the United States."
In his .letter the president paid'
' a high tribute to the character of the
militiamen on the border, and denied !
that any organizations were being;
kept there to perfect military train-!

"Itm-k made ,ip0I1 h|m bv pre?|_
dent Wilson In Hi,> course 0f his
speech III Shadow l.nwn Inst Satur
day. Robert Huron Imn addressed tho
following open letter to Mr. Wilson:
"Sir 111 your capacity rtT cnndldato
lor public olllce you have seen 111 In
H puhiic address lo criticize more
Ulan 140,000 citizens of ihls stnte
who honored me with their votes at
the recent primaries. With tho In
tention of making It appear that njy
candidacy for the Republican senn
; torlal nomination was supported by
I men who would Involve this country
in war. you spoke or me as "a inan
whose avowed position In respect to
International affairs was unneutral
and whose Intention was. If he be
came a member of that great council
upon International afTalrs at Wash
ington. to promote the Interest* of
one side In the present war In Eu
rope.'
"Anil you argued Hint 'If the Re
publican party should succeed, one
very large hranrh of It would Insist
upon a reversal from peace to war.'
I he statement that It was my In
tention ir elected senator to promote
'the Interests or one side In the pres
ent war In Kurope' and thereby
violate my oiith of olllce Is benoath
contempt. M) respect ror the oflke
of president of the United States pre
vents me from characterizing suclA
statement as It dcscrvoH. I leave the
! Judgment or lis falsity to the public.
Eltlicr you have not rend what I hare
said many times publicly on the sub
ject of neutrality, or you have deltb
erntoly misstated my attitude In ail
attempt to raise a raise Issue. With
the accurate, carefully considered ar
raignment of your foreign policy by
Mr. Hughes, Mr. Roosevelt and Mr.
Hoot, I am proud to agree. In your
aiig'-'r and desperation an the ring of
truth closes In about you. you seem
to he trying to make a false Issue.
^ ou say that your re-election inoans -
peace, and that Mr. Hughes's election 7
meuns war. Of course nothing could
be farther from the truth.
"It is Inconceivable thai a presi
dent or the United States should In
sult the Intelligence or the American >
people. Tho statement that a large
number of your fellow cltltens be
cause they condemn your weak, vacll
itatlng policy, wish to plungo this
country Into the horrors of war. Is
preposterous.
"The contention that you or the
Democratic administration have, kept
this country out of war Is specious
and unrounded In tact. Vaclllltatlon,
timidity, weakness In asserting our
rights. Inability to perform our du
ties, confusion of wordB, a constant
change of attitude and threats, un
supported, cannot possibly keep this
nation or any other out of war. It Is
the rear or those who will vote
against you that such conduct of our
foreign affairs will cnevltably lead
us Into war. A strong determined,
clear policy Insures peace.
"It Is unworthy to asset^ that a.
large number of your fellowmen,
Americans of undivided allegiance, of
whole faith, of sublime trust In the
honor und righteousness or their
country would seek to plunge the
United States Into the horrors of war. ,
Such a statement you must know to
be false. If a million votes were to
be yours for making such a misstate- "
ment, If you believed It to bo the only
way to win a desperate cause, you
should scorn bo to misrepresent the i
people of a country which has elected
you to Its highest place of trust.
"The issues of thiB campaign are
vital to the welfare of the nation. I
appeal to you, sir, as a candidate for
the highest olllce, to present the Is
sues squarely and fairly to the people
and abide by their decision without
stopping to Inflame the prejudices of
one class agalnBt another, or un
worthily to Impugne the motives or
to Insult the patriotism of loyal
Americans who may differ from you.
"Tho American spirit, the spirit
of our- ' fathers, who believed
In plain words backed by deeds, who
stood for fair play. Justice and cour
age has always been the safeguard '
of America. The Democrat party and
the Republican party should not be
afraid to trust to this spirit now, and
to state the Issues clearly with honest.
