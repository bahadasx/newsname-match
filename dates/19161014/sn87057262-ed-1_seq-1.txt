ON BOARD GOVERNOR HUGHES'
SPEJOIAl, TRAIN, BEJATRJCB, Neb.,
Oct. 14.—Swinging across the Ne
braska prairies today, Governor
Hughes struck vigorously at the dem
ocratic tariff policy and cried solemn
warning against the evil days to come
after the war, if the democratic tariff
for revenue policy was continued. He
was in splendid fighting trim, hij
voice clear and resonant.
Today the republican nominee was
feeling particularly good after a new
course of treatment administered by
Physical Director. James J. Gibson.
It was nothing more or less than an
athletic rubbing down, which Gibson
started yesterday to give the nom
inee after each one of his big
Sp66Cb6S«
Hughes finishes these oratorical
efforts in dripping perspiration. He
bustles into his overcoat and hurries
to his hotel or on his private car
where .he gets a shower and then
clambers into bed while Gibson
his muscles with alcohol and
witch hazel. As a result, the nominee
gets tfp fifteen minutes later feeling
thoroughly revived and refreshed.
Mrs. Hughes narrowly escaped the
loss of her favorite coat at the meet
ing at Joplin last night. The crowd
jammed into the hall. The campaign
ing party got lost, Mrs. Hughes be
ing separated from the governor.
She took off her coat and sat down
nearby, later moving nearer to her
husband, but neglecting to carry her
coat. Some bystander picked it up
and when time came to leave Mrs.
Hughes could not find it. The gov
ernor himself finally espied and
rescued it. It was the only heavy
coat Mrs. Hughes has with her and
she was extremely pleased to get it
back.
Hughes was scheduled for six
speeches today, starting at Flail City
at 9 o'clock and ending up at Lincoln
tonight.
MB Living on a Stimulant.

FALLS CirY, Neb., Oct. 14.—En
forcement of Airerican rights should
be coupled with opening of opportuni
ties for extension of American trade
abroad, if this country is to succeed
in- foreign fleMs, Republican Nominee
Hughes told an early morning'gather
ing here today. He spoke of the
"temporary stimulus" of the Euro
pean war to American business and
warned his auditors that such a tem
porary prosperity was an unhealthy
condition.
"We want in the United States to
have a basis of prosperity that does
not depend on the European war,
he declared. "We are now living on
a stimulant, but you cannot live on a
stimulant for any great length of
time. When the war does cease, you
will find a great deal of labor dis
appointed in this country. We must
remember that it is perfectly idle to
ask American merchants, American
engineers, American traders, the boys
who go forth in the various oppor
tunities that are afforded in connec
tion with branch Ifouses abroad it
is perfectly idle to ask them to go
forward in the interest of American
enterprise if the American flag does
not mean full protection to every
American citizen lawfully engaged
wherever he is. We cannot have an

PORTLAND, Ore., Oct.' 14.—Screaming Wilson. We want Wilson," and ''where's
the casket. Fetch a coffin," a huge crowd! of democratic women greeted the women cam
paigners for Hughes when they left their spetitd train at the union depot today and started
for the Multnomah hotel. As the first visitors stepped) on the platform a cheer for Hughes
went up and a band began pumping out rapid melody. Suddenly the shouts of welcome
and the music were drowned in a gale of shrill shrieks for Wilson. Police estimated that
Wilson women outnumbered the Hughes spectators three to one. It was a well planned am
buscade and resulted in scenes of confusion.
A squad of shouting women pressed through the mob carrying huge banners. One bore
the words in staring black letters: "Which goose laid the Hughes special golden egg?
Was it Mrs. Belmont or Mrs. Smelter Trust Guggenheim?"
In spite of the commotion, the Hughes delegation gained the street, police pushing a
pathway for them through the crowd. The enemy, however, inarched along step for step
and hurled caustic comment/
Mrs. Henry Moskowitz, who was to speak at Neustadter Brothers factory, asked Po

Mrs. Raymond Robyns also asked for a body guard to protect her during her address

ADRIATIC THOUGHT SAFE
Big Liner Too Far Out Now to be At

Americana on

[United Press Leased Wire Service.]
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.—That the
German submarine U-53 and any
other Teuton fighting submersibles
that may possibly be with her re
main, there is a menace to shipping
from the Maine to the Florida coast
was the admitted belief in United
States naval circles today.
Naval officers said they have not
been lulled into any false hopes by
the submarine's week of Inactivity.
They believe, on the other hand, that
she may be hiding out somewhere in
wait for "big gsme" snch as a muni
tion ship of great tonnage, or pos
sibly a Canadian transport with its
load of human freight.
Some naval oflicials say it would be
impossible to watch the great stretch
of American coast closely enough to
prevent a ship master willing to take
the chance for big gain, to run out to
a certain point and leave oil and sup
plies aboard non-sinkable rafts. Few
here believe the U-53 has even start
ed back home.
As long as the U-53 keeps out of
the three mile limit line, this "gov1
ernment's ships cannot, of course, in
terfere with her activities nnless rtie
attacks an American vessel. But de
stroyer commanders have been issued
explicit instructions to take the most
rigorous measures to prevent any
possible violation of international law
such as supplying of a foreign war
ship from these shores.

Northern Mexico Has Calmed
Down Considerably, Accord

TROOPS MUST REMAIN
Militiamen Are Being Shifted Around

[By Robert J. Bender, United Press
Staff Correspondent.]
ASBURY PARK, N. J., Oct 14.—
Conditions in northern Mexico are
improving and the government will
soon be' able to do more In relieving
militiamen now on the border, Presi
dent Wilson declared in a letter to
Governor Whitman of New York,
made public today. At present, how
ever, need for troops still exists.
"From the beginning of the diffi
culty which necessitated the call for
militia," wrote the president. "I have
been deeply, sensitive of the incon
venience caused to the members of
these citizen military organizations
by their separation from their fami
lies and from their ordinary business
engagements ana pursuits.
"In order to minimise these sacri
fices, the war department is sending
to the border from time to time,
militia which have not participated
In service there and as each fresh
contingent goes General Fanston
selects for return to home stations
such, units as in his judgment can
best ,be spared., Thl^riollcy will dis
tribute this duty over as wide an
area ail possible and make its burden
foil as equally as practicable upon
organized militia forces. The emer
gency which led to the call of the
militia was •.he possibility ot, aggres
sion from Mexico and protection of
our frontier. This emergency still
unhappily exists and I am advised by
the military authorities that with,
drawal of the militia at any time
from the date of its original caU up
to and Including the present, would,
in all human likelihood, have been
followed by fresh aggressions from
Mexico upon the lives and property
of the people of the United States.
Militia have therefore been used and
are being used to repel invasion and
are rendering service of the highest
quality and the most urgently needed
character to their country. I am
happy to believe that the condition
in northern Mexico is Improving and
that in the near future we wiU be
able to do even more than has been
done to relieve embarrassments under
which these organized militia regi
ments have necessarily suffered. I
share your admiration, my dear gov
ernor, for the spirit in which these
havd* served and are serving their
country and would be very sorry to
have it supposed their retention on
the border is for any mere purpose
of completing their military training
or Indeed any less commanding pur
pose than the preservation of our
frontier from aggression."
The president's letter was in reply
to an interrogation from Governor
Whitman regarding the continued
presence of New York militiamen on
the border. The president said that
a substantial number of the New York
contingent, either have been or are in
course of being relieved now and
that he hopes General Fungton soon
will be able to afford the New York
militiamen further relief.
