Conspiracy of Silence.
Allien L. Benson Exposes How Kept
Press Keeps People in Ignorance.
There in one presidential eandi-
date in the field that the kept
newspapers say very little about.
He is making; speeches every day
to large crowd, but
don't seem to know
the press
anything
about it. Of this conspiracy of
Silence Allen L. Pennon. Socialist
nominee for president, says:
'Again 1 warn America. Congress
has pasted and the president, on
June 8 of this year, signed a bill
Into which had own smuggled a
Ration which gives the 1'resident
power. In time of war, to draft
into the Federal Army all male
citizens of good health, who are
between the ages of IS and 45
years.
The newspapers of this country
Are trying to prevent this fact
from becoming known. They will
print almost anything else I say
except a statement of facts
about this draft law.
"I Compelled th e Associated
Press, by a series of verbal and
printed attacks, to put nightly
reports of my speeches on its
wires, and it is now sending to
the 700 newspapers to which it
Supplies telegraphic news nightly
reports of Jlo'J words of the great
meetings i am addressing.
"As a result of telegraphic in
terchanges between the Unite i
Press and myself, the United
Press is sending telegraphic re
ports of my speeches to the 000
afternoon newiapers to which it
supplies telegraphic news.
But th e newspapers for the
most part, are not printing the
new that l have forced into
their offices. They are either
throwing it away bodily, or so
'lilting it down that only the
pale shadow of it is left for their
readers,
i know of no newspaper in the
United States tliat has printed
the facts about the draft law as
1 have given the facts to these
two great news distributing
agencies,
At Indianapolis, on September
.for instance, 1 gave the As
sociated Press a new chapter of
facts in connection with the
smuggling into the Hay-Chamberlain
Army Reorganisation bill of
the section empowering the Pres
ident, in time of war, to draft
cltltens into the army.
1 told how Representative Hud
dteson, of Georgia, after the bill
had been signed and he hail dis
OO verad the word "draft'" in it.
had Introduced a bill to repeal
the "draft'' section Democratic
and Republican members of Con
gress alike refuted to vote for the
jepeal of the section.
1 told how Representative Hud
dleson confronted Represen
tative .lames Hay, of Virginia, in
the House and complained that
the word "draft has been smug
gled into the bill in place of the
word "call.''
l quoted Representative Hay s
statement, made in Congress on
August 8B of tliis year, which fol
lows :
"The gentleman from Georgia
bases his orltlolsm on the fact
that the wrod 'call" was stricken
out and the word "draft" substi
tutcd in conference. I do not
now recollect whether this is true
or not, but what is the difference
between the president Doing au
thorized to call men out and to
draft them? There is no differ
4-nee, so far aa the 1'resident is
4,onccriied."
Then 1 quoted an absolutely
contradictory statement made iu
Congress by Representative Hav
five uiontlm ago on March gS,
1910, Congress was then consid
ering a bill which has since be
come u law under which the
President is given power to draft
tltc entile natioual guard of any
state or all of the states.
Representative Miller, of Minne
sota, objected to the use of the
Word "draft" and suggested that
the word "order" be substituted.
On this occasion Representative
Hay, then chairman of the House
committee on Military Affairs,
suio :
"Tiie word order 'has not the
Mtiiie legal significance us the
word "draft. The word draft'
has a
distinct meaning In all mil-
Itary
bills and laws, and the
word
older does not mean the
name
thing, if the gentleman
will look
the Civil
into the debates during
War, as I have done,
when the draft sections were
Considered by Congress, he will
find tluit the same question arose
and tluit after a full debate upon
it, it was Concluded tliat the
word 'draft' was necessary to
give the President the powers de
sired." And Representative Hay, be it
remembered, was one of the con
ference committee of seven who
changed the word call" in the
Hay-Chamberlain Army Reorgan
isation bill to "draft."
sees
Tliere is no use of minciug
words about this. The authori
ties at Washington, in enacting
the draft law, have done some
thing that they know the Ameri
can people, if they knew It, would
uot like ani would not tolerate.
Republicans and Democrats are
equally guilty, because both Re
publicans and Democrats voted
for it in Congress and President
Wilson, n Democrat, on June 3. of
this year signed the bill contain
ing the draft clause.
President Wilson has claimed
the country's praise for nearly
everything he has done since he
became President, but neither in
the Democratic platform winch
he wrote nor in his speech of ac
ceptance did he dare claim praise
for signing, or did he even darn
mention that he had signed, u
draft law.
Oil the other hand, Mr. Hughes,
who has blamed the President for
almost everything he has done
since he became President, has
never uttered a breath of criti
cism of Mr. Wilson because he
signed a draft law. Indeed. Mr.
Hughes has never mentioned
that Mr. Wilson, on JuttP 3, did
sign u draft law, though any
body can get a copy of the law
by sending to the Government
Printing Office in Washington.
The drart Clause is section 71.
Why are these gentlemen so si
lent about the matter'.'
"Why do the newspapers throw
away these fucts when I give
them to the press associations
and the press associations carry
them to the newspapers?
Every voter who this fall shall
vote either the Republican or the
Democratic ticket will thereby
vot e his approval of the draft
law. There is no other way of
voting against the draft law ex
cept by voting the Socialist tick
et.
.Three million Socialists votes
this fall will cause the draft law
to be repealed I"

Detroit. Mich., October 1. The
administration of President Wll
son and the campaign methods of
Charles E. Hughes, Republican
presidential nominee, were assail
ed by Allan L. Benson, Socialist
candidate for President, speaking
at a mass meeting here today.
Siicuking on 'The Issues of the
Campaign," Benson declared
tliat any dead issue is alive
enough to be discussed by Presi
dent ilson and Hughes, ana an
live issues aie disregarded by
both candidates."
Refering to the army biU, he
said : "President ilson should
repeal the draft section of the
law. If 1 am elected President I
will have enacted legislation
whereby men cannot be drafted
into army service without a vote
of the people."
Cincinnati, Oct. 8. Allan L, Bon
son, Socialist candidate for presi
dent, in a Speech in Music hall
here, commented sharply on ut
terances of President Wilson at
Shadow Lawn Saturday.
"The President said." remarked
Benson, "that Whereas he had ex
pected this contest to be an intel
lectual contest, it thus far had
failed to interest him. Wilson, at
any moment he desires, nwy en
gage in a contest that should in
terest him and, would without
fail interest the people1.
"Let Wilsou tell the people why
he signed the Hay-Chamberlain
army reorganization b.U which
provides that the president shall
pave the power in time of war to
draft American citizens into the
federal army. This is a power !
that even Lincoln did not liavej
when he became pros dent.
"Wilson, iu tlie Democratic plat
form that he wrote, and iu his
speech of acceptance, praised
himself lor many tilings, uui no;
has never thought it worth while
to felicitate the country on the
fact that be has provided it with I
a draft law, nor has he ever dar
ed mention that he signed such a
law. I
"On tlie other hand, Hughes,
Who criticized Wilson for almost
everything else, has never criti
cized him for signing a draft law
or even mentioned that he has
signed one."
PATRIOTS SCARCE.
The w ar lords are not as happy
as they might be. The youttg
men arc not enlisting as they ex
pected. Although the country is
honey-combed with recruiting
stations, aud postmasters are of
fering a bribe of 5." for every
sucker they can entice into the
army, there is uothing doing.
Tlie present plan oi recruiting
has failed and will be abandoned.
A house-to-house canvas is to
take its place. A Dispatch from
Washington says:
According to a new recruiting
order, made public today, "to
meet demands for the present
and the immediate future, the re
cruiting service must be capable
of furnishing annua ly au average
of one recruit per thousand of
population, and this result can be
accomplished only by canvassing
every accessible locality in the
United States aud establishing
tlirough the aid of available post-mastei-s
a convieutly located re- I
orultlng agency for each small
area."
The new plan contemplates es
tablishing such agencies In every
county seat. From these bases
recruiting parties will be sent to
comb tlie rural districts.

Saturday, ou tne tram, i met

that his c.othes wore Shabby.

'lite tractor will be followed by

these wiil pay only on large bo

things necessary to successful
