ARIZONA NOTES.
Items of Interest Culled From Our
Exchanges.
A meeting of the Arizona. Poul
try Breeders Association is to be
held the evening of Oct. 20, at
the Prescott Chamber of Com
merce. On account of its favorable lo
cation, Tucson has been desig
nated as a permanent recruiting
station by the war department,
instead of Phanix, where it was
first decided to locate a perman
ent station.
The general land office has de
cided that non resident entries
on desert lands are invalid and
subject to cancellation. Persons
desiring to locate homesteads in
Arizona, must come and live
within the state before making
entry.
The mill of the Arizona Butte
company is turning out the high
est grade concentrates ever pro
duced in Mohave county. Sam
ples taken from the bins show
the concentrates to have a value
of 66 per cent lead, $45 gold and
12 ounces silver to the ton.
L. P. Verkemp returned from
Navajo and Apache counties
last week. He reports that
there will be over 90,000 head of
lambs shipped out of that coun
try in the next few days. Most
of the fat lambs will go to Cud-
ahy in Los Angeles, the culled
bunches going to the eastern
markets for feeders. Coconino

The McNeal Pair Association
is not alone anxious to better
the grade of livestock and food
stuffs raised in the Sulphur
Springs valley, but the crop of
human mites as well. Por that
reason a "better babies" show
will be a hading feature of this
year's fair at McNeal. October
28, according to residents of that
section.
Four million acres of public
land in Arizona were surveyed
by the government during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1916.
As it takes approximately two
years alter trie survey to pass
title from the government, little
of this land has yet been select
ed by the state land commission.
But there are yet millions of
acres of former selections, avail
able for settlers.
Now that the big Douglas
Phoenix road race to be run on
November 13th is assured, plans
are going- forward rapidly to
make this the biggest event of
its kind ever held in the South
west, and from early indications
it promises not only to outclass
all previous road races held in
this state, but in the number of
entries and time of running it is
expected that it will excel the
famous Los Angeles to Phoenix
desert classic.
During the interim, pending
the appointment of a register of
the United States land office to
succeed Thomas F. Weedin, de
ceased, the office will be kept
open and filings received which
will be held until the appoint
ment of his successor. Pending
that time no action will be taken
on the filings and no dates will
be set for making final proofs.
As the late register was taken
sick just prior to the termina
tion of his leave of absence, the
entire business for August and
September now awaits action by
the new register.
Mrs. Josephine Saxon, coun
ty superitendent of public in
struction, was in town yesterday,
making an official visit to the
local schools. A parent teachers'
association is proposed for Pata
gonia. The matter of school for
the children at the Three R
mine, which has been talked of
for the past few weeks, will not
materialize this term probably on
account of the date set by law
for forming new school districts.
In order to get money for a new
school the districts must be set
aside some time in the months of
May or June. It is estimated
there are about 50 or 60 children
of school age at the There R at
the present time, and the county
school superintendent is endeav
oring to form a private school un
til such time as a regular school
district may be formed. Pata-gonian.
Thomas F. Weadin, register
of the LTnited States land office,
a pioneer of the state and form
erly publisher of the Florence
Blade-Tri bune. died at his homn
in Phoenix at 12:30 o' clock Sat
urday morning. His death was
caused by blood poisoning which
set in as a result of an attempt
to trim a corn. Mrs. Weedin
died during the early spring of
this year, leaving but one mem
ber of the family, Miss Jennie F.
Weedin Arizonan.
News reached Yuma yester
day that Tom Ryning had been
appointed as chief of police in
San Dego, to succeed Keno Wil
son, deceased. Mr. Ryning was,
at the jtime of his appointment,
under Sheriff at San Diego. He
will be) remetn bered in Yuma as
superintendent of the state pen
itentiary when the institution
was located in this city, and as
the architect who dre w the plans
and superintended the building
of the new prison at Florence.
His many friends here will be
pleased to know of his success
in the "city of roses." Yuma

The El Paso Times refers to
prohibition in Arizona as being
largely a joke. That may be
the way it looks to a man as
viewed at long range, from
Texas, but there are scores of
victims in this state who have
spent from ten days to one year
in jail, and paid fines ranging
from $25 to $300 who do not see
it in that light. Like any other
prohibitive law it is violated,
but the violators are made to
feel that it is anything but a
joke. There have been some
Texans who have ventured to
take it as a joke by crossing the
line with cargoes of booze in
violation of its provisions but
they were given a different view
point.
More Prosperity in Mining.
There have been orders placed
for about 450,000,000 pounds of
cooper for delivery over the
first half of the coming year
with leading sales agencies in
the United States during the
last several days, says Iron Ore.
This is a record business in
practically one order for the
world, and the United States has
received it.
This copper is largely for the
allies in the European war and
suggests that the great struggle
for supremacy across the waters
is nowhere near an end.
This great order will be fol
lowed by others. Domestic con
sumers are becoming anxious
again concerning their wants
and will be in the market for
big tonnages. The price receiv
ed for this great tonnage recent
ly sold was around 27 cents per
pound, a figure at which all the
legitimate mines can make very
large earnings.
All of the big companies will
surely substantially increase
present dividend rates, as they
will be able to maintain a higher
level forborne time to come. Cop
per is making .good for the lean
years and this boom will help the
average amazingly. And copper,
on the average, has been about
as good as any form of invest
ment. The stable mines, of
w7hich there are many, are safe
and certain of returning a fair
interest to their shareholders.
Like steel, copper is enjoying
great prosperity at this time and
the future looks good.
PROPOSED AMENDMENTS.
The women voters should con
sider that a complete under
standing of all the proposed
amendments to the state con
stitution is of vital- importance
to every individual who can vote.
To vote blindly may mean dis
tress to many human beings and
its disgraceful for women of the
present day to abuse the suffrage
privilege.
Study the Initiative and Re
ferendum Pamphlet, jiublished
by the State of Arizona, and
mailed to every voter. Borrow
one if yours has been mislaid,
and read it. Talk about it with
others who can help you under
stand it better and you will help
yourself and your fellow beings.
ARIZONA IS "SOME STATE.

square miles in which there is a
water surface of only 116 square
miles. All New England and
i New York combined, have an
area of 114,078 square miles,
from which deduct 5,930 square
miles nf water surface, leaving
108, 14H square miles of land area.
Now add to combined land area
of New-England and New York,
2,30 square miles, representing
Delaware, water and all, and
Arizona is larger by more than
3,000 square miles than the com
bined eight states indicated. .
Of the eight states Delaware
alone has nearly as much popula
tion as Arizona. Though much
of Arizona is composed of rocks
and desert, there are hundreds
of thousands of acres of richest
land on earth, other hundreds of
thousands of the best forests
and grazing lands on earth, and
yet other hundreds of thousands
of acres that are ribbed with the
ore veins of nearly all the pre
cious and baser metals. We
venture the assertion therefore,
that the average potential value
of every acre in Arizona will
equal the.average value of the
acreage in the eastern states
named, though it may not be so
evenly distributed.
The topography of Arizona is
unique and varied. Altitudes
range from just a little above
sea level at Yuma to the peaks
of the San Francisco mountains,
nearly 13,000 feet high. Over
a large part of the state the
snow never falls, while over some
of it the snow lies half the time.
The state is something over 300
miles wide and nearly 400 miles
north and south, so what within
its boundaries is found almost
every climate and soil condition
between Bangor, Maine, and
southern Texas.
With this wealth and variety
of resources, and climate, and a
population of less than three
persons to the square mile, in
cluding Indians and candidates
for office, the reader can get
some conception of the opportun
ities that Arizona has to offer for
homemaking and investment.
To carry the comparison a lit
tle further, Arizona has fourteen
counties, their areas being re
spectively as follows:
Name. Sq miles.
Apache 11,500
Cochise 6,200
Coconino 47,800
Gila 4,750
Greenlee 1,900
Maricopa 9,070
Mohave 13,000
Navajo 10,300
Pima 11,550
Pinal 5,150
Santa Cruz 1 ,250
Yavapai 7,380
Yuma 9,350
Santa Cruz the smallest coun
ty, has two more square miles
than the state of Rhode Island.
Greenlee, the second county is a
little larger. Pinal county is
about the size of Rhode Island
and Connecticut, and twice the
size of Delaware. Cochise and
Yavapai counties are each al
most as large as Rhode Island,
Connecticut and Delaware com
bined. Maricopar:ounty is almost
equal in area to New Hampshire.
Yuma county is larger and al
most equal to Vermont, Apache,
Navajo and Pima counties are
each approximately as large as
Massachusetts Rhode Island
and Delaware, combined, and
Coconino county is nearly as
large as New Hampshire and
Vermont, combined.
These figures are not only il
luminating to non resident read
ers, but should be clipped out
and pasted up in every Arizona
school house, for it is a deplor
able fact that there are mighty
few people, even within the
state of Arizona, who have an
adequate conception of its big
ness and greatness, either actual
ly or potentially. Arizona.
For $3.25 a thousand feet the
state of Arizona has sold 19,000,
000 feet of standing timber lo
cated on state land in the Coco
nino national forest to the Ariz
ona Lumber and Timber com
pany of Flagstaff. The timber
to be cut stands on 1,907 acres,
and will bring a net return to the
state of $39,000. Flagstaff Sun.
GOOD SERVICE RENDERED.
Wood row Wilson stands for
free government, for honest gov
ernment, for visible government
for common rights of men and
women, of business groups and
organizations, of municipalities
and States, of the United States
and of the other nations of the
world whether they be weak or
powerful. He has been free of
the influence of special interests
whether brought to bear by-
money power within the United
States or by the greatest mil
itary Power on earth. Proof
lies in the long, explicit and
wonderful record of his perform
ance in the Presidency. For
that reason he was able to say
in his speech accepting the De
mocratic nomination for Presi
dent: "I do not doubt that the peo
ple of the United States will
wish the Democrats to continue
in control of the Government.
They are not in the habit of re
jecting those who have actually
served them for those who are
making doubtful and conjectural
promises of service. Least of
all are they likely to substitute
those whe promised to render
them particular services and
proved false to that promise for
those who have actually render
ed those very services." Guard
ian. QUITE AN EFFORT.
Among the fifty jurors who
sit during the September trial
session of the superior court,
none have had the novel ex
perience of J. R. Newton, who
rode on the back of a small
burro 185 miles to answer the
summons of the court. Mr. New
ton arrived in Yuma from his
ranch six miles south of Parker,
on Sunday evening have ridden
the entire distance on one of his
faithful burros, leading another
burro carrying a pack contain
ing blankets, cooking utensils,
food for himself, feed for his
burros, etc. He started from
home on Monday, September 18,
and was en route seven days
traveling much of the time at
night as well as in the day time,
camping by the wayside when
ever necessary to rest. Sun.
DEER ARE SICKLY.
According to report brought
to Clifton a large number of
deer in the Blue and Eagle coun
try have died recently from a
disease called "black tongue."
Game warden Harry Hinck and
Forest Ranger Adams report
that between them they have
found over 30 dead deer at dif
ferent points along the trails in
the upper country. They state
that the deer afflicted with the
disease are in such a condition
that they are eas.'ly approached
and show no sign of fear or re
sistence. Physicians declare that
persons eating the meat of deer
thus afflicted will probable do so
with fatal results, and it is up
to the hunters and others desir
ing to partake of the juicy game
to be particularly careful to as
certain whether or not. the an
imal is suffering from the "black
tongue." It is said that the di
sease is accompanied by the
hair falling from the animals'
bodies, and if in doubt, when
meeting a nude deer, pass it up.
