As yet few of the men working on

BOSTON, Oct 13. An unidentified
submarine off tho New England
coast was reported by the steamship
ltovic today ut a time when the steam
ship lane to Europe was dotted with
in uii i t i:n - la (1 1 ii ships Just released
from the embargo placed on their
movement after the activities of a
Herman submarine off Nantucket last
Sunday.
The liovlc, bound from Manchester,
England, for New York, did not re
port tho submarine's nationality, but
Uiive its position when sighted at s
a. in, today, at about two hundred
miles due cast of Now York, not f.ir
from the scene of the t"-boat's activi
ties of last .Sunday. The Hovlc is due
in New York late tonight or some
time lomtirrow .
The reports of tho atrangc subma
rine wero coincident with announce
ments that a fleet of British cruisers
and destroyers was off the coast und
that virtually the entire avallablo de
stroyer flotilla of the Atlantic fleet of
the United States navy was on neu
trality duty.
Talk of Sub Itnse.
That tho American destroyers were
conducting an active investigation of
stories of secret submarine bancs on
this coast was indicated In a dispatch
from Har Harbor, Maine, which said
the destroyer Paulding made exhaus
tive search of the coast between liar
llaroor and Pockland today. There
was not a cove or rocky Ink't that es
caped the sharp scrutiny of the do
slroyerf,' officers. At dusk the Pauld
ing put hack to Rockland olid It was
understood thut she had discovered
nothing suspicious during tho dav.
Tho depurturo of a tug from New
I-ondon, where there have been re
ports of preparations made for re
ceiving a Herman submarine freight
er, gavo rise to much speculation .is
to whether the undersea boat sighted
by the Hovlc was a merchant subma
rine instead of another raidor. The
tug, however, put in at Vtnevard
Haven und it was said there that she
was going out to tho Hutch steamer
HloomersdiJk, which was torpedoed
Sunday, to see what the chances were
for salvage. Tho tug with a dlvor
aboard was held In port tonight by
a gale.
Searching Atlantic.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. Destroy
ers from tho Atlantic fleet are making
a search of the Atlantic -coast from
Newport north to tho Cunadlan line
to investigate reports of hidden sub
marine ba.ses or wireless stations. Ad
miral Mayo, commander of tho fleet,
reported to tho navy department to
day that he had ordered the search,
but did not disclose eltlfer the source
of the reports on which ho acted or
the places w hero Illegal radio plants
or, bases wero said to havo been dis
covered. Secretary Daniels made it plain to
night that the admiral had acted on
his own initiative In sending out tho
scouting craft on this mission, al
though when the European war be
gan general orders were Issued to the
fleet commanders to take all neces
sary steps to safeguard American
neutrality. So far us the department
knows there is no present intention
on Admiral Mayo's part to extend his
search soulh of Newport. Navy of
ficials believe he had no very defi
nlto information on which to act.
