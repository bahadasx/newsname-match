Prince Nicholas Koudscheff, the Rus
sian minister to China, lodged a pro
test at the Chinese foreign office
against the proposed American railroad

Lanshow Fu. He alleged that the Chi
nese minister in Petrograd promised
verbally eighteen years ago that Rus
sia should have the privilege of build
ing railroads in the neighborhood of
Mongolia.
The disputed line Is to run for a dis
tance of approximately 400 miles. The
agreement entered Into between the

the American company to contract
equal mileage elsewhere, if the protdft
holds.

Submarine Mile in Rear When Sighted
by Freighter Bovic—Olav Said to Be
Carrying No Contraband Large
Fleet of Freight and Passenger
Steamers Preparing to Sail From
New York.
New York, Oct 14.—"When the White
Star freighter Bovic sighted an east
ward-bound submarine In the Atlantic
yesterday morning she apparently was
In pursuit of the Hellig Olav, a Danish
passenger ship, according to observers
who arived here on the Bovic.
The Bovic, in fear of attack, be
cause of being a freight ship, put on
full speed and headed directly west.
As she passed out of sight of the other
vessels, the Ifanish boat still seemed to
be endeavoring to escape from the sub
marine. The submarine was about one
mile to the Daife's sterm. This was
about 8:30 a. m.
The Hellig Olav left here Thursday
for Copenhagen and other Scandinav
ian ports, carrying thirty-six passen
gers in the first cabin, thirty
seven In the second cabin, and steer
age passengers. Many of thosft in the
cabins are Americans.
At the time she was sighted by the
Bovic the Dane was flying no flag, but
her identity was distinguished by her
name and the Danish flag painted on
her side. The Bovic reached port with
a gun mounted on her stern.
Representatives of the Scandinavian
American lines said today that the
Hellig Olav carried no contraband and
that they believed the captain would
not undertake to escape.
Delayed Ships to Ssil.
The largest fleet of steamships that
has left this port since the submarine
raid off Nantucket last Sunday Is due
to sail today. United States destroy
ers are still searching for a secret base
for German submarines, but so far
without success. Captains of incom
ing steamers were questioned by skip
pers of out-bound vessels -for any in
formation of the German submarine,
but without success.
Among the liners ready to leave here
today are the St. Louis, ot the Ameri
can line, for -Liverpool the French
Jlner Espaghe, for Bordeaux the liner
Stockholm, for -Gothenburg the Re
d'ltalia, for Genoa, and the' Cameronla,
of the Anchor line, for Halifax, In
addition td these twenty-six other
steamers Had cleared for departure to
day.
Thirteen steamers were due here to
day from European or American ports.
The latest of the trans-Atlantic liners
to airive was th'e Gedric, which came
in last night from Liverpool. The
Cedrlc, warned In midocean of the U
68, put out all lights and followed a
zig-zag course.
U-53 Homeward Bound.
New York, Oct. 14.—A German sub
marine, identifying itself as such by
wireless and stating that it was "from
Newport," was sighted on Tuesday
more than 100 miles east of Nantucket
lightship by a neutral ship now in port
it became known today. The subma
rine was moving in an easterly direc
tion.
The submarine was sighted some
distance from the neutral vessel, which
is understood to be the Bovie (British
steamer), which was signaled by wire
less from the submersible asking its
name and nationality. It was given
and the question asked in turn:
"Who are you?"
"German submarine from Newport.
Good-by," was the reply.
The assumption waa that the sub
marine was the U-63, responsible for
the shipping raid of Sunday, and this
report is the latest on its whereabouts.
The U-53 was last sighted prior to that
time by the Greek liner Patris Monday
morning.
Neutrality regulations of the nation
whose flag the ship flies and specific
orders with respect to their observance
are given for withholding the name of
the ship bringing the report here, but
it is vouched for as correct by a high
marine authority of this port who is
in close touch with arriving steam
ships.
Ships Lesve Philadelphia.
Philadelphia, Oct 14.—About a dozen
steamships in the trans-Atlantic serv
ice, held up here the past week be
cause of the German submarine men
ace, sailed today. Among ships that
left are the British steamer Crown
Point the Georglo, for Brest the Min
nesota, Saxon, Arab, and the French
Jiner Ville de TamataVe and the Japa
nese steamer Nanka Maru.

law of Deavers, saw the shooting. She
said. Clay was shot in the back. She
could give no reason for the tragedy.
Clay and Deaters were together last
night by the deathbed of a neighbor,
P. T. Millet and it Is thought some
difference arose there.
The career' of Clay had been a
stormy one, A few years ago he was

President Makes Announcement in Re

Whitman in Behalf of New York Mili
tiamen—.Denial Made of Charge That
Soldiers Are Being Detained Merely
For Military Training.
Long Branch, N. J., Oct. 14.—Presi
dent Wilson in a letter to Governor
Whitman, of Now York, sent Oct. 9,
and made public today, deolared that
the emergency which caused the send
ing of the mllltla to the Mexican bor
der "unhappily still exists". 'He added,
however, that "In the near future It
probably will be found possible to do
more than has been done to relieve the
embarrassments which militia regi
ments have been forced to suiter."
President Wilson wrote to Governor
Whitman in answer to a letter from
the New York executive regarding the
New York military organizations on
the border. The president said it was
impossible to set a date when the re
maining New York regiments there
could be released.
The president said he was advised
that withdrawal of the militia "in all
likelihood would haye been fol
lowed by fresh aggrewlons from Mex
ico upon the lives aiiu property of the
people of the United States."
Not For Training.
Mr. Wilson denied that any organi
zation was being kept on the border to
perfect its military training. The let
ter follows:
"My Dear Governor Whitman: I
have received your letter of Sept. 20
and have taken up with the secretary
of war the situation as it affects New
York troops on the border. I have
been deeply sensitive on the Inconve
nience caused the members of these
citlsen military organizations by their
separation from their families and
their business pursuits.
"In order to minimise these sacri
fices the war department is sending
from time to time fresh contingents,
and General Funston then selects foi
return to home stations and mustering
out such as in his Judgment can
best be spared. This policy has al
ready, resulted in thejrgturn of ^num
of Ne^-York and other organlzS
tions.
ber
Emergency Still Exists
"The emergency which led to the
call of the mtlitia, was, as defined in
my call of June 18, the possibility of
aggression from' Mexico and the pro*
tection of our frontier. This emergen
cy still, unhappily, exists, and I am ad
vised by the military authorities that
the withdrawal of the militia at any
time from the date of the original call
up to and including the present would
in all likelihood have been followed bj
fresh aggression from Mexico upon the
lives and property of the people of the
United Sta/tes. The militia have been
and are being used to repel Invasion
and are rendering services of the high
est quality and of a most urgently
needed character to their country.
'It would, of course, be impossible td
"feet a date at which the relief of any of
the remaining units can with certainty
be accomplished. I am happy, how
ever, to believe that the condition in
northern Mexico is Improving, and that
In the near future we may be able to
do more than we have done to relieve
the embarrassments the organizations
have suffered.
"I share your admiraitlon for the
spirit In which these men have served
and are serving their country, and
would be very sorry to have it sup
posed that their retention on the bor»
der is for any mere ipurpose of comple
tion of their military training or any
less commanding service than the
preservation of our frontier from ag
gression. Very truly yours.

to me is more extraordinary than the
claim of this administration that it has
kept us out of war. Only Inexcusable
blunders could have got us into war.
"We did not have peaoe in Mexico.
We had war. It was an ignoble war
fare. It was personal war. It was not
based on anything that Is sanctioned
by international law. It was a matter
of vlndlctlveness to destroy the only
semblance of government that Mexico
ever had.
""We have had no proper policy ot
peace in Mexico. I desire to see peaoo
maintained, but It will not bo maintained
unless we have It understood that we do
not propose to meddle with things that
do not concern us, and in the next place
that we do propose that the Just rights^
of our oltlsens, with respect to their
lives and property, will be iqatntaimsa.''
