Austro-Germans Press Invaders
in Transylvania Sector Stead­
ily Backward
VIOLENT FIGHTING
ON THE CARSO FRONT
French and British Repulsed in
Fierce Attack on the Somme
Front
London, Oct. 13—Steadily the pres­
sure of the Austro-German forces is
compelling the Roumanian troops
who invaded Transylvania less than
eifht weeks ago to fall back upon or
toward their own fighting line. In
eastern Transylvania north of Kron
stadt, Berlin reports additional terri­
tory free of Roumanians. Southeast
of Kronstadt, the Austro-Germans
have also been successful against the
invaders. The Roumanians, however,
are offering stubborn resistance. Bu­
charest reports the repulse by them
of attacks on the frontier of southern
Transylvania.
Violent Fighting on Carso Front.
Violent fighting continues on the
Carso front, in the Austro-Italian the­
atre, with further successes for the
Italians. In the vicinity of Gorizia,
and to the south of this region, they
have repulsed heavy Austrian counter
attacks, inflicting heavy casualties,
and east of Doberdo have approached
the second Austrian lines, taking 400
prisoners.
Novavas is Captured.
Vienna admits the loss of the town
of Novavas, but announces that the
Austrians put down Italian attacks
at other points on the Carso plateau,
and made 2700 men prisoners. In
the Pasubio region of the Trentino
sector some additional gains in ground
are claimed by the Italians.
The French and British have been
repulsed in an attempt to break
through the German line between the
Ancre and the Somme rivers in
France. The British attacked in the
region of Geudecourt and the French
near Saiily, but neither was abte tb
pierce the defense of the Germans,
although London claims a slight ad­
vance near Geudecourt. South of the
Somme, stubborn fighting is still in
progress at"Gernermont and Ablain
court.

SCOURING COAST FOR
SUBMARINE BASES
Washington, Oct. 13.—Destroyers
from the Atlantic fleet are making a
search of the Atlantic coast from New­
port north to ihe Canadian line to in­
vestigate reports of hidden submarine
bases or wireless bases. Admiral
Mayo, commander of the fleet, report­
ed to the navy department today that
he had ordered the search but did not
disclose either the source of the re­
port on which he acted or the places
where illegal radio plants or bases
were said to have been discovered.
Secretary Daniels made it plain to­
night that the admiral had acted on
his own initiative in sending out the
scouting craft on this mission, al­
though when the European war began
general orders were issued to the fleet
commanders to take all necssary
steps to safeguard American neutral­
ity.

Submarine
Question
London, Oct. 13.—The operations of
the German submarine boat U-53 off
the American coast raises no new is­
sues as far as the British government
•is concerned, in the opinion of Lord
Robert Cecil, minister of "war trade,
who discussed today with the Asso­
ciated Press the latest development
in-the relations between Great Britain
and the United States. Lord Robert
declares that this form of warfare on
merchantmen violated international
law as it was recognized by Great
Britain and the United States in the
day before th war and was still ob­
jectionable to Great Britain, but no
more so when it is done on this side
of the waters.

fair grounds gridiron tomorrow for
the first local fracas of the season.
Coach Boise has done wonders with
the raw material and has whipped
the high school squad into the sem­

school also has a formidable line-up.
The boys expect to line the field
and put up goal posts in the morning,
and the scrimmaging will start at
2:30. There will be no admission fee
charged and the clash will be a good,
hard work-out and scrimmage to get

posits in the mountains of Utah may
develop a source of American potash,
in the belief of government scientists,
who have been conducting laboratory

Sumarine Is Seen Off New Eng­

ship
NATIONALITY OF THE
Boston, Oct. 13.—An unidentified
submarine off the New England coast
was reported by the steamship, Bo
vie, Itoday, at tftie time when the
steamship lane to Europe was dotted
with munition laden ships just releas­
ed from the embargo placed on their
movements after the German subma­
rine raid off Nantucket last Sunday.
The Bovic, bound from 'Manchester,
England, for New York, did not re­
port the submarine's nationality, but
gave its position when sighted, at
8:00 a. m., as about 200 miles due
east of New'York, not far from the
scene of the U-boats' activities of last
Sunday. The Bovic is due in New
York late tonight or some time to­
morrow.
The report of the strange subma­
rine was coincident with the an­
nouncement that a fleet of British
cruisers and destroyers was off the
coast and that virtually the entire
available destroyer flotilla of the At­
lantic fleet of the United States navy
was on neutrality duty.
That the American destroyers were
conducting an active investigation of
stories of secret submarine bases on
this coast was indicated in a dis­
patch from Bar Harbor, Me., which
said the destroyer, Paulding, sent out
from the Newport naval base yester­
day, made an exhaustive search of
the coast between Bar Harbor and
Rockland today.

PROTECTIVE TARIFF
IS CHIEF THEME
Joplin, Mo.. Oct. 13.—Charles E.
Hughes today took his campaign to
Missouri. This is the fourth of the
states that skirt the so-called "Solid
South" to be visited on his present
trip. Save for one stop, at Spring­
field, Mo., the entire day was spent
traveling. The nominee reached Jop­
lin tonight, nearly three hours be­
hind scheduled time, and addressed
an audience in a bit? tent, making his
chief theme the protective tariff.
Mr. Hughes told the crowd that
the present prosperity of the country
was built on sand, that "the intoxicat­
ed fancy may indulge in happy
dreams, but the sober thought of the
country is directed to the day when
this stimulant—the Kuropean war—
will be no longer available."
He referred to "those who are seek­
ing to make political capital out of
our present war prosperity," portray­
ed in detail as he viewed them in the
United States when the war shall end
and assailed the Democratic tariff
policy as a policy which "means aidle
plants and impoverished workmen.''

Bayonne, X. J., Octfl Hi.—After a
day of intermittent disorder, in which
a patrolman was shot through the leg
by a sniper and two wounded prison
ois were taken in a raid by special
police and firemen, a downpour of
rain, followed by a cold wind, tonight
cleared the streets of Standard Oil
strikers and kept them in tlieir homes.
Three powerful searchlights on tiie
roof of the tallest Standard Oil build
ings were played constantly over the
strike zone.
At a strikers' committee meeting to
night a plan to send a delegation to
the headquarters of the Standard Oil
company in New York tomorrow was
voted down on the ground that the
company officials might interpret
such a move as a sign of weakening
on the part of the strikers. All Stan­
dard Oil tugs tonight were moored to
the piers here, prepared for fire duty.
The few ships that were at the docks
in Bayonne were towed away for safe­
ty.
Officials of the Standard Oil com­
pany today said the company would
close its plant for a month or six
weeks, as it is four months ahead in
orders. Company oflicials insister to­
night that strike breakers would not

Seat on Short Notice
STATESMAN STRONG IN
THE KIDDIE'S HEARTS
In spite of the earliness of the hour
and the lateness of the announcement
that Fairuanks would grace the Mor
ton county seat with a visit, a large
delegation was on hand to greet the
former vice president when No. 4 ar­
rived this morning, and a few mo­
ments later an audience of several
hundren had assembled to hear him,
The public schools were dismissed,
:tnd the young people helped to swell
the crowd and the enthusiasm.
McKaig Praises Bismarck.
In introducing the speaker, County
Chairman McKaig graciously thanked
the Burleigh County Republican Cen­
tral committee for its courtesy in ac­
cording Mandan half of the time
which Mr. Fairbanks was to have de­
voted to Hismarck, and he designated
Mr. Fairbanks as one of the fairest
men who ever has served the nation
as vice president.
Pleases the Kiddies.
•Mr. Fairbanks devoted the first part
of his address to the youngsters, with
whom he made himself solid right at
the outset. He commended the teach­
ing of county, state and national gov­
ernment in the schools referred to
the changes which are now taking
place in the maps of Europe, and de­
clared that it was for the boys and
girls of today to see to it that our
government is preserved from the
disasters which have overcome the
older governments of the world.
Stands For Protection.
The former vice president stood
flat-footedly for protection, for a re­
turn to the policies of McKinley,
which gave to America its era of
greatest prosperity. He pleaded for
the election of a "president who will
stand for these wise. Republican
principles," and who will prepare the
country to meet the conditions which'
it must face following the close of
the European war, when 30,000,000
men now serving in the trenches will
re-enter into competition with Amer­
ican workmen: when these men will
go back to the factory and the field
and when they will look for an out­
let for their products to America,

CAPTIVATES STUDENTS
IN HIGH SCHOOL SPEECH
Earnest and Forceful Appeal in
Support of the Candidacy of
Hughes
Bismarck and Mandan did not And
Charles Warren Fairbanks, former
vice-president and candidte for this
high office again, as cold and distant
as reported.
They found him a warm, affable and
genial man with a firm grasp ot na­
tional affairs. He entered into the vig­
orous program mapped out for him
with a vim and during the day made
several telling speeches in behalf of
the candidacy of Charles Evans
Hughes. It was a dignified and logi­
cal discussion of issues unmarred by
any attack upon President Wilson.
Fairbanks' appearance here helped
the candidacy of Hughes and he rid­
dled some of the foolish campaign
slogans of the Democrats such as
"Peace and Prosperity," and "He
Kept Us Out of War."
At Home Here.
Mr. Fairbanks felt at home in Bis­
marck at once. One of the first men
to meet him was Mr. Maurice Maittn,
superintendent of schools, whose par­
ents owned a farm in Ohio, adjoining
the old home of Mr. Fairbanks. As
they met in the hotel, Mr. Martin
handed the former vice-president a
copy of his old home paper, "The
Maryflville Tribune."1
Another old acquaintance'Is Supt.
Taylor of the Indian school, who wis
raised a few miles from the Fairbanks
home in Ohio. While Mr. Fairbanks
is now a citizen of Indiana and gen­
erally classed at a "hoosier", his boy­
hood day were spent in Ohio.
Speech at High School.
Following the luncheon at the
Grand Pacific hotel, Mr. Fairbanks,
accompanied by W. L. Prater, chair­
man of the county committee, Supt.
Martin and press representatives,
motored to the high school where the
high school students and those of the
higher grades were assembled. As
Mr. Fairbanks entered he was given
an enthusiastic reception and won tho
students in an appropriate speech.
Tribute to Martin.
Mr. 'Fairbanks paid a high tributo
to Supt. Martin in which he said:
"It was indeed a pleasure to meet
your new superintendent of schools
here. I know something about him,
having been raised in the same neigh­
borhood. I knew his father and moth*
er and there are no finer people any­
where."
The former vice-president then
spoke of the object of education. Tell­
ing of a trip to Japan, he said that he
had visited the schools to find out the
hopes and aspirations of young Japan.
"So it is here,' 'he said. "You must
go to the schools to learn of the fu­
ture. For the future sits in the
schools. The responsibility of this
government will some day rest upon
your shoulders and there was never
so important a time as the present
when changes are so rapid."
His speech throughout was strictly
non-political. It was a line opportun­
ity for the students to hear a man of
national reputation and one who serv­
ed the nation as vice-president.
Mr. Fairbanks lingered at the
school as long as possible and seemed
to enjoy the brief respite from the
political part of his mission to Bis*
marck.
He was then taken to the Grand Pa*
cific for the chief speech ot the day.
The hotel was appropriately dec*
orated in the national colors and the
formed vice-president spoke from an
automobile in front of the building*
More than 500 people heard him and
frequently applauded. He discussed
the national issues, chiefly the tariff
policies of the Republican party.
Mr Fairbanks said in part
The Reunion.
"I am glad to hear about the re­
union of the different elements that
constituted the Republican party a
few years ago. The men who differed
four years ago and whose difference
resulted in the election of Mr. Wilson
as president have known splendid
poise and magnificent patriotism In
forgetting the differences of four
years ago, and I am glad to And as I
go up and down through the conntir
that our countrymen, almost to a maa
have buried the old differences of four
years ago beyond the reach of the
hand of resurrection. Why? Because
there are great questions to be solv*
ed, vital questions, and they can only
be solved in the fullest and best de­
gree by all who believe in the sound*
