Four states now placed in the

agers will decide the presidential elec
tion on November 7. The four are
New York, Indiana, Ohio and. Illinois,
with a total electoral vote of 113.
In all of these states the Republican
candidate. Charles E. Hughes, appears
to be gaining strength. In fact, the
only nation-wide canvass of the field
so far made by the New York Her
ald a few days ago gives! Mr. Hughes
a slight lead all over the country
except, of course, in the Southern
states. The lead is not large enough
to Justify declaration of triumph by
Republican managers.
For the week ending September
the New York Herald's country-wide
"straw vote" showed Hughes in the
lead in 28 states. The ten southern
states were not canvassed, since they
are solidly Democratic.
Out of a total of 31.0S votes gath
ered in 24 states California, Arizona,
New York and Nevada excluded Mr.
Hughes leads the president by a ma
jority of 27.r. Of the states which ap
pear in the tabulations, Mr. Hughes

The -College of Hawaii will under

situation In Hawaii with a view to

blockade of a hostile fleet cut off the

letter from the governor addressed
to President Dean and Regent Far

was discussed at the conference:
"Gentlemen: Some weeks ago. In

Inspection of Stores in King
Street District Results in
Rare Discoveries
Complete destruction of approxi
mately 10O0 cans of "swelled" good3
In a searching visit of inspection to
203 Oriental stores in the King street
district from Moanalua to River street
is a part of the work accomplished
during the week ending today by M.
B. Bairos, deputy food commissioner,
with a staff of assistants.
Simple arithmetic shows that this
is an average of 'five spoiled cans to
each store, but as Mr. Bairos inves
tigation found the majority of stores
in fair condition, the average becomes
much heavier for those which were
found ill conditioned. .'One of these
alone suffered the destruction of $31)
worth of such goods. Certificates
showing the amount of spoiled goods
destroyed were given to every pro
prietor. Campaign Is Educational
The investigations will be kept up
for it is the aim of Commissioner A.
W. Hansen and his office force 'that a
system of educational inspection shall
be instituted here which will put the
food houses of the city beyond con
demnation. The commissioner puts
the emphasis upon the educational
feature of -the work because he be
lieves that only by teaching the store
keepers sanitary storing cf goods, and
breaking them from thir old habits,
will success result.
The story of Haircs' investigation In
the Oriental district this week is not
particularly appetizing. It deals with
cockroaches that crawl over dried
fruit, worms that infest old fish, and
butter and Jelly dishes lined with big
blue flies.
-Once a whole herd. of cockroaches
ran out from under a "box oI dried fish
when we lifted up one of the parti
tions'," Bairos declares. "At another
time we. found big tub of guavas in
fected, with fruit fly- worms and had
to destroy them.
