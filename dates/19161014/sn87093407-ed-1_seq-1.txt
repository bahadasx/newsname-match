Should a judge who has gone wrong once be
given another chance?
Milo A. Root is a candidate for ♦ uperior
court. Some year* ago he was a judge on the su
preme court of this
state. At that time
he went wrong.
He was indiscreet,
or worse. Anyhow,
he resigned under
fire.
Mllo A. Root
railway, then represented by ex-Jin * •
He resigned while under the threat of ifnpe -
ment trial by the legislature.
Now he seeks to wear the ii. . d
again. Bis neighbors and hi- nrr oik well
of him. They say he is a fine nei '"id
good citizen. Many of these friend of hi? have
come to The Star urging that R»n -titled •
another chance.
The Star has told these friends of R as
it has told Root, that it dislikes to bring up the
old charges against him. During; the nry
campaign The Star remained silrr' , » '
Root would be eliminated and it would not b<
necessary to say anything against bin.
As it happened, however, Root won a n« ur
ination. He is now within one step «>f tho u|vf. r
court bench.
The Star can forgive almost »r- public
official who has gone wrong except a i> '-e. A
judge, enjoying all of the judicial pc natives,
putting himself up as a sort of superman, must
necessarily live up to that standard. If a mayor
goes wrong, or a councilman, there ar~ r»o<vi and
sufficient reasons why, aft' a n ; . r- ion,
such a public official should 1 "iv - ,- " r
change. Often, as in the ca.v of r " C'i'l. !
experience makes the man a 1 et» r r.nd br
public official. But in the case of a ; ' •<•, Tb««
Star entertains no such opinion. A jud r "one
wrong should never again be trusted to sit on tti
bench.
The Star doesn't say that he should not be
trusted with s,»me public office, but it doe *-av
that, he has no business even seekitv to regain a
judgeship.
Granting all that Root's friends and n h
bors say of him as being true, the f. t tin
that Milo A. Root as a judge proved him It until
to be a judge.
That is the opinion of The Star. What i-> the
opinion of the voters? Should a judg' who - t

Replying to a question from

said the Lusitania sinking

Why not go the full route?
Perhaps the European war
would have been prevented, too.
