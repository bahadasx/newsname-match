J,,'.,'K Wednesday, Dr. David, the so
cialist leader, declared' "our enemies
want 'no immature' peace before the
annihilation of Germany.
'rarest rirted submarine war,
hovv-
,'r will not hasten the
idvent of
peace, but will further prolong the
win'." he said.
"We understand German indigna
tion against the British policy of
starvation and against the I !ritinh plan
of warfare after the conclusion of
ponce. Kngbid Invariably pretends
that Germany was glad to go to war.
Therefore, the events of the final

"(in July 30, 1314. the world
thouffht that It roiild again breathe
in peace. Sir Edward Grey and
Prince Liehnnwski (German ambas
sador to Great Hritain) had, with the
assent of the Russian ambassador at
Louden, found the formula for an
understanding, thus: 'If the Aus
trian advance against Holgrado is
stopped, the powers shall examine in
what manner Serbia can satisfy Ans

"On the same day. our chancellor
telegraphed our ambassador at ien
im advocating a direct conversation
lK'twccn Vicuna and St. Petersburg
and declaring that Germany would
decline to be drawn into the world
war if her suggestion were not heeded
by Austrtn-Hungary. Vienna simul
taneously accepted Ithe formula of
the understanding.

"This was the situation upon which

fell. Knglnnd's guilt is thus1 an un

July 30. Russia was sure that F.n

Hr. David insisted that peace would
come as soan tf Germany's enemies
understood the impossibility of anni
hilating her. Pointing out that no!

Kind, preach a. war of annihilation,

David emphatically repudiated the
Idea that Germany could b" eon

"ours is a war of defense," he con
tinued. 'This binds us all together.

No Purpose of Coii(uost.
"We did not enter the war with In

Joplln, Mo., ocl. 1,1. Charles R.
Hughes today took Ills campaign tot
Missouri, the fourth of thn staton that
skht the so-called "solid Houth' to bo
Msiled on Ills present trip, 8av6 for
one stop, at Springfield, tho entire day
was spent trnvehnif. Tho nonilnort
reached Joplln tonight and addressed
an audience In a big tent, making hlH
chief theme the protective tariff.
Mr. Hughes told the crowd that thn
present prosperity of the country was
built on sand, that "tho intoxicated
fancy may Indulge, happy dreamt), but
the sober thought of tho country is
directed to the day when this. Btlmu-
lanl the Kurnpoiin war will 1)0 no
longer available."
Scores Democratic Policy,
lie referred to "Ihoso who are neck
ing to make political capital out of
our present war prosperity," portrayed
In detail conditions as ho viewed them
in the Cnited States when tho war
shall end, and assailed the ilouiociatlo
tariff policy as a policy which "moans
idle plants, and Impoverished work
men." At Springfield, and attain here to
night, Mr. HiiKbes uHsalled the, admin
istration for Ihc enactment of tho
A'lamson law.
"What are real laws?" he asked.
"Real laws are passed after Inquiry
with some understanding of the justieo
of thiv.euso., with Hoinojdcrt of what ls
Inv olv ed and ought "to be' done. ' Shall
laws l o passed under duress? I am

Prosperity .Now Cnliealtli).
"Ko thoughtful American can view
our present economic situation with
out nerloiis apprehension. We aro un
der (he unhealthy stimulus of the Ku
ropean war. Hopes aro raised which
cannot be fulfilled. Our present
prosperity Is built on mud. our trado
is not determined by conditions of
normal competition, but of an abnor
mal Kuropcan want,
"Munitions of war are but n frac
tion of those suddenly expanded re
ports. Kv erylhlng- we produce food
stuffs, metals, manufactured articled
or every sort Kuropo puts forth her
hand for to fill the void created by
her extremity. The resullinic employ
ment of labor on an unprecedented
scale an, increased purchasing: power
stimulates trade throughout the coun
try. The intoxicated fancy may In
dulge In happy dreams lull thn sober
thought of Ihe country Is directed lo
the day when this st I inula 111 will bo no
longer available."
"You cannot have our export! sud
denly jumped hundreds per cent, in
some eases thousands per cent, and
Ignore either tho cause or the effect
of lis removal.
hen War Is (cr.
"What will bo our condition when
the war is over? In the first place, il
huge amount of labor employed at
high wages will lose that employ
ment. Tlie demand which It Is now
supplying will cease. The mere stop
page of the maniifact mo of muni
tions will mean in Itself ii serious
change In the opportunities, of labor.
When the millions of men In tho
trenches ret urn to production tmr ex
ports of manifold products will fall
off tremendously, even as they havo
risen 1 1 emendoiisly.
"Think of the percentage of Amer
ican labor now profitably employed in
making Kurope's necessilieH create!
bv the existence ol war. What will
occur when those necessities tio longer
exist '' The labor now devoted to that
abnormal demand must compete with
Ihe labor satisfying the normal op
portunities of American trade. Tho
change will be reflected in diminished
purchasing power.
Cause lor Serious Thnunht.
''I do pot desire lo exfiKgeirafo.
There Is enough to give us Horloua
Ihougbl without exaggeration. Amer
ica wnli Kurope at peace, will not
lave the opportunity of Kuropo at
war. The difference will be) most
keenly felt.
"We shall not simply lose opportun
ities for labor. We shall have tho ac
tive , ninpct i ion resulting from tho
resumption of foreign production.
That production will be more skillful,
mole Intelligent, better organized, in
every one of the loreign nations now
at war I tin ii il ever lias been before.
Nations will not only seek to protect,
so tar as possible, their economic. In
dependence, but they will seek our
markets. It is fatuous to suppose that
the wash's of Hie war will Incapaci
