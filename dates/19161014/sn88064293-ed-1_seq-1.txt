GROWERS EXPLAIN
THE SUGAR SALE
TO THE REFINERY
Daal Mad* After Two Unsuccessful
Attempts to Sell Local Product
j The committee of the American
Cane Growers' Association has pre
pared a statement regarding the re
I cent sale of Louisiana sugar to the
j American Sugar Refining Company,
and the discussion that has arisen
over the pro-rating of the sugar
through a sub-committee. It is signed
I by R O. Young, chairman; E. F.
j Dickinson, J. C. LeBourgeois, E. A.
• Pharr and D. W. Pipes, Jr. It fol
lows:
"Recently there have appeared in
the press comments on the purchase
■of fifty thousand tons of ninety-six
degres test sugar by the American
Sugar Refining Company from some
sugar producers of Louisiana, sale
having been made through a com
mittee of the American Cane Grow
ers' Association. In commenting on
this trade numerous errors have
crept in, these errors being doubtless
more due to the unfamiliarity of the
writers with this subject than to any
desire to distort the facts in the mat
ter.
"Some members of this committee,
feling that at the profitable price of
sugar it would be wise to dispose of
their products early in the season,
went to New York and tried to effect
on the open market a sale of a quan
tity of sugar at a fixed price for Oc
tober, Nevember and December deli
very, but were unsuccessful in so do
ing. Later, in July, a similar attempt
was made to sell a large amount of
sugar to the American Sugar Refin
ing Company, without success.
"Feeling that nothing might be
done towards distributing the iftigar
of the present crop and fearing that
it would all be thrown on the New
Orleans market in a limited period of
time and break prices to an unwar
ranted low figure, in comparison.
,v...
with the world's price of sugar, th
American Cane Growers' Associa
thion appointed a committee com
posed of Dr. R O. Young, Messrs. E.
F. Dickinson, D. W Pipes, Jr., J. C.
LeBourgeois and Eugene A. Pharr to
negotiate with Mr. Earl D. Babst,
president of the American Sugar Re
fining Company, for the sale of fifty
to one hundred thousand tons of
sugar, and this committee went to
Chicago for that purpose.
"After negotiations covering a
period of about five days, in which
tenders and refusals wer? made, the
sale of fifty thousand tons was final
ly consummated at • differential of
twenty points under the New York
price, sugars to bs delivered during
the months of Nevember and Jan
uary in the proportion of 50 per cent
in November and 40 per cent in Jan
uary.
"This committee would have far
preferred to have gotten the New
York prices in New Orleans for
their sugars. But the President of
the American Sugar Refining Com
pany would not buy sugar on their
terms, and insisted upon a different
ial of twenty points under the New
York price due, as he puts it, to the
fact that freight from New Orleans
to New York on any sugars that held
to be moved to that point would be
from twenty-five to forty cents per
hundred pounds. He argued that
sugar so taken to New York would '
To the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by the Local Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary to
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for euch non-pay
ment.
Morgan Gty Underwriters Association
be costly, and insisted that a part of
the sugars staying in New Orleans to
be melted should bear part of the
burden of this cost.
"Failing to find a purchaser at
better terms, and considering the
fact that sugar for delivery in Feb
ruary and March was being offered
at prices about (3-4c) three-fourth
cent per pound below the prices rul
ing for November and December
delivery, the committee decided to i
accept this differental. In doing this j
it had in mind that in previous years ;
when freight rates to New York ;
were only 12 cents, a differential of j
eighteen points had been demanded j
and obtained on contracts made by j
the American Sugar Refining Com
pany. In other words, the different
ial at that time was 50 per cent
more than the freight charges;
while on the present contract the
differential was nearly 50 per cent j
under the freight rate. Also for the
reason that other domestic raws
such as Porto Ricans and Hawaii
ans are selling in New York at
prices ten or more points below the
Cubun sugar.
"Into this contract was incorpora
ted the following agreements, which
tons as a rluc, that the minimum
by sugar producers with the sugar
refiners in previous years, such as:
"Correct tare on sacks of 2.70
pounds per sack; an absolutely fair
method of polarization of sugars,
both buyer and seller being repre
sented and differences, if any, being
submitted to a neutral third party
for adjustment. It also was agreed
that fort-eight hours after the ar
rival of sugars in the New Orleans
switching district should be consi
dered the delivery which effects the
basis of prices. In arriving at the
price of sugar is was further agreed
that instead of a minimum of 200
ton as a sale, that the minimum
quantity should be 400 tons. That
no sugar on which a differential al
ready existed, such as Hawaiian
sugars or other Louisiana sugars
sold in New York, should be consi
dered in forming a basis of price,
and that the price should be based |
on an average of sales made in ten j
days—five days prior to the arrival |
of the sugars, and four days after, j
A most important feature also
was the cutting down of what is
known as the twenty-eight day
clause to fourteen days, it being the
custom that sugars shipped and
reasonably due to arrive in New
York within twenty-eight ways from
the date of sale, to be classed as spot
sugar. Such an arrangement fre
quently permitted sugar which had
not been ground out of the cane to
be classed as a spot sale. The cutting
down of this clause to fourteen days
instead of twenty-eight days was of
great value, as in previous years and
previous contracts it had cost many
thousands of dollars of losses to the
Louisiana sugar producers.
"And all thia was strengthened by
an understanding that in case of any
disagreement arising from any cause
that the sellera should appoint one
arbitrator, and the buyer another,
who together should choose a third,
to arbitrate any differencea arising
through a misinterpretation or
misunderstanding of the contract.
"Aa a further indication of the
fairness of the contract, it was in
sisted upon by the American Sugar
Refining Company that while no
sugar producer of the state was obli
ged to enter this contract, it was op
en to all to participate and to Bhare
equally.
"The above are features which no
seller had ever been able before to
obtain from the American Sugar Re
