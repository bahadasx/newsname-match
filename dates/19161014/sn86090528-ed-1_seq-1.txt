CHIEF SAYS
BOYS MUST
QUIT CARS
Automobile? Around Movi Tbentres Es
pecially Will Be Watched by
Officers in Future
"It is only the 'rats' that are doit, g
the damage to cars and as radically
uo complaints have been tnade to the
department- of automobiles being
scratched or otherwise injured we have
not kept a strict watch on them," said
Chief of Police Ben Phillips this morn
ing. "While the police department
cannot maintain a close guard over all
cars which are lined up in the busi
ness section, we will do our best to
prevent damage.
Other city officials state that the
boys who are believed to be guilty of
most of the offenses mentioned are
children of loose character. It lias
been suggested that they be sent to
school but as most of the offenses are
said to be committed at night and
there aro no night schools, the only
relief offered to automobile owners is
that furnished by vigilant officers who
henceforth will rigidly prosecute this
law.
PERMIT IS
GIVEN FOR
'CAT RACK'
Throwing balls at the nigger baby
will not be prohibited by law under

Theie was a difference of opinion
to the interpretation of the term doll
racks embodied in the gambling ordi
nance passed by the city council Thurs
day evening with the emergency clause
providing for the waiving of the usual
three readings.
The bill had not yet been signed by
Mayor Coffmau yesterday afternoon
when a local man applied to the city
clerk for permission to run a "cat
raeX" on the vacant lot at Fourth and
Chickasha avenue. As the city clerk
believes this is a game of skill and not
of chance and that the rdinance pass
ed Thursday night does not become a
law until it is signed by the mayor and
published, the permit was granted.
ft was stated by city and county of
ficers today that this ordinance will
not affect the stalls wherein patrons
throw at dolls or cats, as this is class
ed as a game of skill.
