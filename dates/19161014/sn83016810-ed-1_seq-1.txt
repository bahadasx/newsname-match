The paragraph which It Is proposed
to add to said Section Two reads as
follows I
"A revolving fund of not over
two hundred iifty thousand dol
lars ($250,000) may be set apart
from the fund derived from the

ditches and fire breaks in. through

swamp lands and in clearing such
lands, such fund to be replenished
as long as needed from the en
hanced value realized from the sale

Under Section Two as it now stands
the proceeds of the sale of school and
Bwamp lands constitute the principal
of a trust fund, the -income of which
Is used for the support of the schools,
educational and charitable Institutions
of the state. Section Two as it now
ctands provides that the principal of
such fund "shall forever be preserved
Inviolate and undiminished."
THE EFFECT of the proposed
intendment, if adopted, will be to mod
ify the provision Ipst quoted to the
extent of permitting: the legislature to
et aside not to exceed 9250,000 of the
principal of the trut fund as a revolv
ing fund to be used for the purposes
Stated In the amendment proposed.

may be invested in the bonds of any
county, school district, city, town or
village of this state, but no such in
vestment shall be made until approved
by the board of commissioners desig
nated by law to regulate the invest
ment of the permanent school fund and
the permanent university fund of this
state nor shall such loan or invest
ment be made whet) the bonds to be
Issued or purchased would make the
entire bonded indebtedness exceed fif
teen per cent of the assessed valuation
of the taxable real property of the
county, school district, city, town or
village issuing such bonds nor shall
such loans or indebtedness be made at
a lower rate of interest than three per
cent per annum, nor for a shorter pe
riod than five years, nor for a longer

relieve the real property in such town,
school district, county, village or city
In this state at the time of the issuing

If the proposed amendment Is adopt
ed It will then read as follows!
"The permanent school and uni
versity fund of this state may be
invested in the bonds of any coun
ty, school district, city, town or
village of this state, and in first
mortgage loans secured upon im
proved and cultivated farm lands

nent school fund and the perma
nent university fund of this state
nor shall such loan or investments
be made when the bonds to be Is

lines shall relieve the real prop
erty in such town, school district,
county, village or city in this state
at the time of issuing of such

THE PURPOSE of the amendment Is
to authorise the Investment of the per
taanent school and university funds in
"first mortgage loans secured upon Im
proved and cultivated farm lands
where the amount of the loana so se
lured does not exceed SO per cent of
the valae of the land mortgaged.

PROPOSED AMENDMENT NO. S.
By Chapter 381, Laws 1915, the legis
lature proposed for adoption by the
(lectors, an amendment of Article Nine
19) of the Constitution by adding
[hereto a new section, which reads as
Jollows:
"Sectiono 17othe The legislature

pacity, and as trustee for the peo
ple of the state, which are situate

meandered public lake or riv*r,
and for that purpose may provide
for the drainage of any such lake
or river, or the diversion of the
waters thereof to a new bed or

H.U funds arising irom tne saie of
such iron ore, or oaier minerals,
snail lorever be preserved invio

come therefrom shall be used tor
the construction, improvement
and maintenance of tne public
roads of the state. The principal
of such funds shall be loaned or
Invested in the same manner, by
the same officers and upon the
same terms as is, or from time to
time hereafter may be authorized
by the constitution and laws, for
the loaning or investment of the
permanent school and university
funds of the state."
THE PURPOSE of the proposed
amendment cannot be more clearly
stated than Is expressed therein.
THE EFFECT of the amendment, If
dopted, would be to confer power on
the legislature to provide by law for
the mining of Iron ore and other min
imis, which the state owns In Its sov
ereign capacity and situate under the
bed of any meandered public lake or
river, subject to the restriction that
the rights of riparian owners on any
such lake or river, shall not he de
stroyed or Injured without compensa
tion. If the legislature exercises the
sower, in case it Is conferred, it could
ulso provide for the drainage or di
version of the waters of the lake or
river with reference to which It so
legislates} It could also prescribe by
whom such minerals could be mined
end the compensation to be paid to the
state therefor. The proceeds of the
sale of any such minerals would con
stitute a fund to be loaned and invest
ed the same as the permanent sehpol
Rnd university funds, the Income of
such fund to be used In the construc
tion, improvement and maintenance of
public roads.
PROPOSED AMENDMENT NO. 4.

that one term -in each year shall ba
held in each or any- judicial district. It

MONUMENTAL BUNK.
(From the Louisville News.)
A few "grand old Southern gentle
men" are agitating the building of a
monument in honor of the old black
Mammies and Uncles of ante-bellum
days. This agitation going on through
the Southern press is full of disgust
ing sentimentality expressing the high
regard of said gentlemen for said Mam
mies and Uncles. According to the
truck we read slavery was a great and
noble institution and both Slave and
master were happy and contented with
conditions. No slaves tried or wanted
to escape so delightful a bondage the
crack of the whip as it brought blood
from some black today regardless of
sex, the bark of the hound as he chased
human, prey, who in a foolish moment
had yielded to the desire for liberty,
the bidding at the auction block when
mother and child were torn asunder
are all fiction according to these kind
hearted old gentlemen. But because
of the service. the happy service
given by the old Mammy and the bid
Uncle they would build a monument to
their memory. And in years to come
Southern white boys and girlsdis
gusted and angered at the continued
"freshness" of black boys and girls
can look at that monument and remem
ber "things were not always thus."
Why not a monument to the thou
sands of known and unknown lynched?
Why not a 'monument to the thou
sands of Colored Women raped and
seduced in the backwood towns of
Southern States? Why not a monu
ment at Waco, Texas, where 15,000
men and women cheered the burning
of a black boy? These monuments are
about as necessary and would be as
decorative and beautifying as one to
the old black Mammy and the old
black Uncle.

The National Colored Citizenship
Kignts Congress which met in Wash

At Wednesday night's mass meeting
addresses were made by Wm. Monroe

of local branch and Rev. W

On Thursday the Congress went in

The Congress recommended to the
Equal Rights League consideration of
further getting-together of race or
ganization and endorsed the princi
ples of the League. It also adopted
a ringing address to the country.
The address says in part:
"For many years after the close of
the civil war peonage was practiced
in the South, which has never become
thoroughly reconciled to equality of
citizenship. Separation of colored
passengers from all other racial ele
ments on common carriers, prescrip
tive legislation, residential segrega
tion, lynching of thousands of colored
men and even women, charged with
offences never proven in the courts
of justice, has become almost a na
tional disease.
"The race has greatly multiplied in
numbers and in usefulness. It has re
duced its illiteracy to a very low per
centage. Wherever the door of op
portunity has been opened it has dem
onstrated its ability to meet the most
exacting requirements of our civiliza
tion. We seek nothing but justice and
that equality of rights and that equal
opportunity which are denied to none
of the other groups in this country.
"We denounce the segregation of
colored employes in the Civil Service
of the Federal government as un
American, unjust and wicked, shame
ful and disgraceful abuse of power.
"We denounce the spirit of those
so-called representatives of the peo
ple in the halls of Congress, who are
constantly seeking to de-citizenize the
race by the introduction of reactionary
legislation which belong to the past
age and which the great b6dy of Amer
ican people have outgrown."

gress, a law by Congress making
lynching a federal crime, a committee
to wait upon Congress, drastic oppo
sition to all sorts of race segregation

riers and domiciles and organization
of the race by colored leaders were
among the measures favored.
Condemn Wilson, Favor Hughes
A strong address to the country was
adopted scoring Wilson for.his race
segregation and favoring Hughes as
the means by which to put Wilson
out. The address contained the fol
lowing: Owing to the alarming spread
of Jim-crowism we declare, an oppo
sition to the whole policy of race
separation in public and semi-public
institutions, in places open to the pub
lic as undemocratic and un-American,
a denial of equality of rights and des
tined to make the colored people social
and civic outcasts.
