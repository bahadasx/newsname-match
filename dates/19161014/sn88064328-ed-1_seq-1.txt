"IF I WERE THE DEVIL.'
Dr. Prank Crane says: "If 1
Were the Devil I would be not only
cruel and wicked, but I would be
exceedingly cunning, by so niucli
as the Gods exceed men, I would
know that men do not live to do
things because they are bad. but
only because they have persuaded
themselves that those thins« are
good. Hence I would not waste
time trying to prevent mçu's
conscience, but I would twist their
reason, estop and becloud their in
telligence so that in doing the most
hideous and hateful business they
would verilv think they did Ood's
service.
The most delightful condition
to me as the Devil, into which I
could possibly throw mankind is
war. Here and here alone every
one of my instincts have full
scooe and satisfaction. Here is
the destruction of human beinus
carried on with every accompani -j
ment of diabolism. Here they are
the Devil's own children and
farthest from Iteing the childrenj
of my enemy The Most High

beautiful and magnificent, where.
a thousand men are dismembered
bv one salvo, or lie quivering and
shrieking on the ground after one
charge; where trenches' swarm,
with human creatures going mad
with noise a ud terror, sitting with
ganmrcened wounds in muddy
V waters, suffocated with the stink '
of their dead companions, fly
blown and maggot.eaten by their
Ade, or falling asleep from ex

Jjaustion while my rats eat their
Mvmg che.eks and lips.
Oh, war is a sweet feast to me,

women and their children stamped
out by military heel like scamper

the raging war men. the futile
prayers smashed by mail fisté upon
the palsied mouths that utter
them the whole hoarse rattle and
roar of modern warfare, worthy
of hells gala day.
And I would make men do this
from the highest and best mo
tives they have ; they should talk
of religion and duty to God and
of devotion to the fatherland, and
of heroism and of nobleness, and
ha. ha! those who decline to en
gage in thig welter should be
•hamed and called cowards and
weaklings and public enemies.
And I would so manipulate (!ov
ernment that men would engage
Hn this reek of fury for no reason
at all. A few diplomats would

utterly kill off all common sense,

such a cloud of race-hate, national

If you intend going on a hunt
the first thing to do is to secure
a license. Mr, W. S, Berwick, the
parish game warden, intends to I
enforce the law without reference
to persons, and if any one is
caught violating the law, he will
lie made to answer for the offense
Mr. B. A. Dauterive. of Centre
ville, thoughtlessly went out this
weeik, shot a few birds, think pos
sibly that he would secure the nec
essary license latter, and he was
caught bv the game warden, who
confiscated the birds, and cited
Mr. Dauterive before court. He
was fined $25.00 and costs, which
* Tegated the sum of $32.50.
We do not believe that Mr. Dau
terive intended to violate the law.

The best money maker on the
farm is the hen. She turns grass
into greenbacks, grain into gold,
and from the sand and aravel she
coins silver. There is nothing else
on the place to compare with her.
The cattle and horses are heavy
consumers, and to sret their value
we must part with them ; but not
so with the hen. Tn her small
way she is a gold mine on the face
of the earth, a mill that grinds
that which others overlook or re
