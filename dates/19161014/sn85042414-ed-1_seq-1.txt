German Military Critic
Makes Vigorous Reply
to Entente.
WEARING OUT GAME
FAILURE, HE SAYS
Glorious Victories in/ Bal
kans and Transylvania
Are Inspiring.
Berlin, Oct 14.—(By Wireless to
SayviUe).—In answer to the views of
Generals Joffre and Haig as to the
results of the Anglo-French offensive
on the Somne and also in reviewing
the situation on other fronts, the mil
itary critic of the Overseas News
agency, a semi-official bureau, writes:
"Just as General Joffre did. Gen
eral Haig now feels obliged to strike
a balance of the Somme battle. His
review of the result of the battle,
which already has waged more than
three months, was published a few
days ago. In it the British com
mander takes a view curiously oppo
site to that taken by the French com
mander, who considers the gain of
terrain as the main result.
"The British general says: 'The un
interrupted systematic pressure of the
entente armies must finally exhaust
the morale and material forces of the
central powers especially as to the ex
isting reserves of war material.'
"This so-called strategy of wearing
out their opponents, through which
a great decision of the war was ex
pected, however, has accomplished
very little as proved by the great suc
cesses gained by the central powers.

NO NEW ISSUES
FOR BRITAIN IN
Warfare Against Interna
ticttial Law, Says Lord
Robert Cecil.
London, Oct. 1.4.—The operations of
the German submarine boat, U-53,
off the Americah. coast raises no new
issues, as far as the. British govern
ment is concerned, .in. the .opinion of
Lord Robert Cecil, minister of war
trade, who discussed with the Asso
ciated Press the latest developments
in the relations between Great Brit
ain and the United States. Lord Rob
ert declared that this form of warfare
on •merchantmen violated Internation
al law, as it was recognized by Great
Britain and the United States in the
days before the war, and was still ob
jectionable to Great Britain, but no
more so than when it is done on this
side of the water.
Referring to reports of meetings
between Sir Richard Crawford, com
mercial attache of the British em
bassy at Washington, with American
bankers' and business men, Lord
Robert said no departure in principle
had been made from the British
blockade measures, but it could be
safely said that the general policy
leaned in the direction of a modifica
tion rather than an extension of the
black-list. The reply to the Ameri
can black-list note was now on the
way to Washington, and this an
swered the United States' criticism
of the principles behind the measure.
As regards the administration of the
black-list, Lord Robert said Wash
ington had forwarded very few' indi
vidual complaints about it.
Replying to the charge that Great
Britain is violating its equal treat
ment provisions of the Anglo-Ameri
can treaty of commerce and naviga
tion of 118.5 by granting licenses to
Japanese and French exporters,
while refusing permits to American
shippers for similar, goods, Lord
Robert Cecil. said that'. such restric
tions were in the. hands of the board
of trade,, but. that. he was personally
of the opinion.that such treaties lost
validity during, a.
state of war.

Washington, Oct. 14.—The Japan
ese and Russian protest against the
Chinese contract with the American
International corporation for railroad
building, had not been officially re
ported to the state department today,
but officials expressed deep interest.
However, there now seems no diplo
matic issue to involve this govern
ment.
The corporation, as a private
American organization, secured the
contract, through a loan to China en
tirely on its own account, without
communication with the state depart
ment.
As an American corporation, how
ever. It is entitled to the good offices
of this government in case it becomes
evident that its rights are being vio
lated.
Pekin, Oct. 14.—Japan and Russia
entered protests today against con
cessions for railway constructions in
China, which have been granted
Americans.
Prince Nicholas Koudachef, Russian
minister to China, lodged the protest
at the Chinese foreign office .against
the proposed American railroad from
Feng-cheng Shanshl province to
Lanchow-Fu, in Kansu province, al
leging that the Chinese minister in
Petrograd promised verbally 18 years
ago that Russia should have the
privilege of building railways In the
vicinity of Mongolia.
The disputed line was to run for a
distance of approximately 400 miles.
An agreement, entered' into between
the Siems-Carey company of St. Paul,
with the Chinese government, empow
ers the American company to con
struct an equal mileage elsewhere if
the protest holds.

600 miles of railway- later was con
tained in the agreement.
The loan was to be secured by

cessions or government guarantees.
The Chinese government agency
urged the appointment of an Ameri

United States Destroyer Ac

New York. Oct. 14.—When the
White Star freighter Bovic sighted a
westward-bound submarine in the At
lantic yesterday morning she appar
ently was in p.ursuit of the Danish
passenger ship, "Helig Olav, according
to observers on the deck of the Bovlc,
which arrived here today.
The nationality of the submarine
was not identified. The Bovic, fear
ing an attack because of being a
freight ship, put on full speed and
headed directly west. At the time
she passed out of sight of the other
two vessels, the Danish boat still
seemed endeavoring to escape from
the submarine.
The weather was clear and the
Helig Olav was between two and three
miles distant at the moment she first
was observed with the submarine
about one mile to the Dane's stern.
This was about 8:30 a. m., when the
Bovic approximately was 200 miles
east of New York.
The Helig Olav left here Thursday
for Copenhagen and other Scandi
navian ports, carrying 36 passengers
in the first cabin, 37 In the second
cabin and many steerage passengers.
Many of those in the cabins are
Americans.
At the time she was sighted by the
Bovic, the Dane was flying no flag,
but her identi$y was distinguished by
her name and the Danish flag painted
on her side. The Bovic reached port
with a gun mounted on her stern.
The reports of the strange sub
