That Is Campaign's True Angle

ACHIEVEMENTS ASSURANCE
BLUNDERING IS NO HABIT
.Wincing Democrats Trying to Run
i Away. From the Record of tho Ad
' ministration and to Invelglo the
' Voten Down Rhetorical By-Pntha,
; ' All in the Thlnly-Dlsgulscd Effort
, to Chance the Subject.
When Mr. Hughes criticises tho roc
' ord of Iho Administration tliu spokes
' men of Mr. Wilson cry: "What would
. you litivc done?" They forget tluit It
. Is Mr. Wilson nud not Mr. llutrlicH
who In; on trial. They forget that
four years ngo Mr. Wilson criticised
Mr. Tn ft and Mr. Itoosevelt throimh
' lout the campaign anil that Mr. Tuft
' and Mr. Itoosevelt defended their re
spective records, Instead . of crying
"What would you have- done?" They
.forget .these things or they refuse to
(confess them. They arc trying to run
nwny from the record of the Adminis
tration and Induce the people to fol
low them down some hy-puth of rhe
torical h othesls. all In the cu'ort to
change the subject.
"By their fruits yo shall know
them." When Mr. Hughes was Gov
ernor of New York he did not pay
political debts by lining the public
ofllces with unfit men. Ho did not
champion certain principles during his
campaign and repudiate them after
lie entered ofllce. As Governor, ho
did not resort to bravo and bcr.utlful
, words as a substitute for firm anil con
sistent deeds. He was careful In his
use of words but he backed his words
with deeds. lie did not promise what
he could not perform. He did ' not
plaster the people with compliments
they did not deserve. Ho was not a
7 rhetorician, he was not a llatterer, hu
was not "too proud to light" for labor
or for capital, for the strong or tho
weak, when the right was on their
! Mr. Wilson's spokesmen seek to dl
yert attention from the attacks Mr.
Hughes Is making cion the record of
the Administration by asking him:
"What would you do?" they are un
consciously helping Mr. Hughes. They
nre recalling to the memory of tho
people the record he made throughout
his two terms as Governor of New
York. It was then that hu first said
'"public ofllce shall not be a prlvato
snap under my administration," and
made performance square with prom
ise. There Is this about Mr. Hughes
that makes him so different from Mr.
Wilson: "Hughes menus what ho
says." So It Is that the campaign Is
really n contest of character between
two men, with sincerity as tho differ
entiating and deciding factor.

suits for daniagen the nation which
violates those essential rights must bo
checked and called to account by di

"HE DIDN'T DO RIGHT"

- Minds and It .Will Cost Mr.
Wllsori Many a Vote.
A Democrat who never voted for a
Republican candidate for President ex
cept In 18712, jvheu he was forced by
the lad: of n Democratic nomtnee to
cast his ballot for Horace Greeley,
says: "I expect to vote for Woodrow
Wilson, but I don't like his course la
the railroad dispute, lie didn't do
right."
The railroad controversy has Intro
duced a moral Issue Into the cninpalgn.
Mr. Wilson sacrillcod principle to ex
pediency, or what he Judged to be
cvpcdlcucy, when he tamely surren
dered to the demands of the train
service brotherhoods.
He put his own personal and party
need before the public good. He angled
for votes. He aimed u body blow at
the tried and tested arbitration method
of settling differences.
"God help you; I cannot," he Is said
to have exclaimed to the railroad man
agers, who do not poll ns many votes
as l boh- employes. Hut he could have
helped them If he had stood Impartial
ly between them nnd the utterly reck
less tmln-servlco representatives
who were bent on their rule-or-ruln
programme.
"He didn't do right." The consci
ousness of that fact Is sinking deep
Into the American mind.
"He didn't do right." Thut wide
spread conviction will cost hlui thou
sands of votes on election day.
"He didn't do right." He preferred
the weak, the timid, attitude of the
born compromiser.
The American people like courage.
The like convictions. They like a
man who has the courage of his con
lctlnns. They like a man who Is
' willing to risk consequences for the
1 sake of a Just cause.
' It was an unjust cause In which
Woodrow Wilson enlisted when he ac
cepted the brotherhood view that the
chief Item in their de Jiinds could not
be arbitrated. Providence Journal.
FIVE THOUGAND A DAY.
Enrollments in the Hughes National
College League.
The Hughes National College
League, fill Fifth avenue, New York,
Is receiving enrollments at the rate
of live thousand a day. They are
coming from all parts of the country,
and the work of organizing branches
in nil states and most of the Important
cities has been sturted. A largo per
centage of the enrollments arc from
men who give their usual political
adlllatlons ns Progressive, Democratic
or Independent.
The league has received the en
dorsement of Governor Hughes, who
wired: "If there wns ever a time
when the educated men of the country
who have Its welfare at heart should
work for right principles and strong
government It Is now." Chairman
Wlllcox of the Republican Nutlonal
Committee, ex-President Toft, and
John Hays Hammond have also prulsed
tho work enthusiastically, as much on
the scoro of the benefit to the men
themselves ns of the reul work It will
do to help elect Governor Hughes.
The President must be credited with
having put a slick one over If he can
get the votes and make the people pay
the freight.

8th Illinois
The greatest spectacle of its kind
since the Civil War was witnessed
in San Antonio Wednesday when
15,000 soldiers, State troops and
regulars papsed through the streets
of the city in anmbroken column
of more than eh ven miles in length.
Thousands of spectators lined
the streetJvand sidewalks long be
fore the parade reach Alamo Plaza
from Fort Sam Huston. The line
of march reached the city thortly
after nine o'clock, from Camp Wil
son. 'Ihoudaudb of people in eve
ry walk of life formed a solid mass
to witness the military parade.
All public schools adjourned for
the duy to give the 20.0u0 school
children an opportunity to see the
parade.
Order of March.
The order in which the troops
marched follows:
Engineer battalion consisting of
lllim is and Texa companies.
Second brigade commanded by
Ginearl Hill and consisting of
Third, Fourth und Eight Illinois
infantry regiments.
Third brigade commanded by
General Richard&ou and consist
ing of the First, Second and Third
Wisconsin infantry regiments.
First brigadado commanded by
Colonel Keunon and consisting of

sisting of Missouri, Kansas and
Illinois companies.
Ambulance companies. U S
No. b, U. fc. Provisional B and
Wisconsin cuinpauy.
Field hospital: Illinois 1 and 2
and U. S. 0.
Negro Band Scores Victory
i'be most important feature in
the parade was the Eighth Illinois
Infantry band. Ten bund3 par
ticipated in the parade aud weie
greatly applauded each time they
played, but The Eighth Illinois
band was the most enthusiastically
applauded, Tho Eighth Illinois
Regiment is composed of some of
the leading citizeus of Illinois, and
the commanding Colonel Franklin
A. Dennison, a native born Sun
Antoni n, has held many promi
nent position in Chicago's local
goverment. Prof. W. E. Tucker
deserved much credit for the serv
ice that he hus tendered in train
itiK the regimental bund.
The Eighth Illinois Infantry,
which has beed stationed at Fort
cfnm Houston for the past two
months has been ordered to return
to the State of Illinois to be mus
tered out of bcrvice of the Federal
Government. According to a re
turn dispatch, many of the men
who came south to serve tho Go
vernment, on returning home wi I
find themsel.es witnout their posi
tions -It was announced at the
time that militiamen who cnliled
during the early part of tho sum
mer, whould be restored to their
fonucr positions on their return
home nnd on returning home to
fiiul thr-mbe.vcs without their posi
tion will serve ir unexpected trg
dy to many of them who have no
support.
The imire infantry is slated to
leave Sun AnUnio Saturday, Oct.
7, for the State of Illinois, where
they will be mustered out of ser
vice on their arrival. This regi
ment is to be comp'imented upon
thiir deportment during the three
month that they have remaii.cd in
San Antonio, and it can bo truth
fully stated that, they have caus
ed the local authorities less trouble
than any reg'ment that ha9 been
stationed in San A ntonio for the
same lenjjth of time on any previ
ous occasion, which is due largely
to the manner in which Col. Dcu
niion hascommauded his regiment.
