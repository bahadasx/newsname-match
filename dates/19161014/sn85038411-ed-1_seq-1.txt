•There is no truth in the report as
given out in several quarters vsterda> ,
that my sister was twice engaged and
that her death was due to an over

been familiar with our sister's life from
her babyhood. She has had no secrets
from us. We regret very much that
any such rumors should have be<-n •••>-

LOOK AT SLOPES
AS YOU WALK
Suggested That River Park
Strollers Glanfe at Gulleys
and Rubbish
To-morrow Is likely to be another de
lightful October day and thousands of
people will walk along the River Front.
... as b " en that interested
citizens, who enjoy this exceptional
promenade, might for the occasion
constitute themselves a general coinnm
tee of inspection to determine the great
need of placing the slope between the
upper and lower walks in permanent
and attractive shape.
Gullets will be seen at close Inter
vals along the entire front, great stones
scattered along the granolithic walk in
viting mischievous boys to destrov the
concrete steps, rubbish from the floods
or last Spring covering the granolithic
walk, water running over the walk im
mediately north of the pumping station,
and other evidences of neglect and In
difference.
City Commissioner Bowman has given
a . 'in l * illustration of how the slope
should be treated in the riprapping of
the slope immediately south of the plaza
wall at the pumping station. He has
also constructed at this point a walk
along the slope that is convenient and
substantial. Most people are wondering
why it should be so difficult to put the
entire terrace in permanent shape by
riprapping and heavy planting of
shrubbery.
So the >ingestion that to-morrow the
people who will walk along the lower
and upper walks should be the eves of
the community and let the Department
of Parks know how they feel about it.
