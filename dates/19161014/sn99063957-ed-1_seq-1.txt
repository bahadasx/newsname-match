Berlin, via wireless, to Sayviji . Oct. 14 Ninety fresh
Anglo-French divisions (about 1,620,000 men) were prac
tically annihilated in the three months and a half of the
Somme offensive the military critic of the semi-official
news agency asserted today.
These divisions were withdrawn and disappeared
completely from the battle, he wrote. Fifty five divisions,
in consequence of heavy losses, could engage in the com
bat only twice; fifteen divisions were in action three
times and only one remained so intact that it could enter
the battle four different times. Four divisions were
beaten so badly that after the second engagement they
had to be sent to fronts where little fighting occurred,
but on critical days were recalled and sent to other fronts.
j v Since the beginning of the Somme offensive, 178 divis
ions (3,184,000 men) partly new and partly filled up, have
been launched against the German positions, the military
critic stated.
Russian losses from June to October 1, he estimated
at about 1,000,000 men, quoting the statement of a Kiev
fficerin a Swiss paper as authority. Some Siberian
regiments were completely annihilated, he asserted, and
the Fourth Siberian army corps alone lost between
1.1,000 and 14,000 men from August 31 to September 3.

Market Rather Quiet
Prices Unchanged
New York, Oct. 14. The New York
Evening Sun financial review today
said:
On a moderately active volume of
trailing prices showed active volume of
dencies in the best part of the short ses
sion, with early movements either way
confined, as a rule, to small factional
changes. In the greater number of
stocks, however, opening quotations
were slightly above yesterday's closing,
while throughout the first hour ad
vances and losses from the initial fig
ures were about evenly distributed. It
was almost wholly a professional specu
lation in which traders exhibited little
disposition to make extended committ
ment on either side of the account. To
a great extent activity was provided
by the steel and copper issues, the equip
ment shares, Borne of the motors, the
shipping issues and a few of the rails,
most of which sold off before the close
of the market.
Among the specialties Consolidated
Gas, International Paper was in demand
and othter low priced securities appear
ed to be attracting buying, notably Erie
and Rock Island. Advanees in the first
of the session induced more or less liqui
dation in all active stocks, but offerings
were easily absorbed.

President Tells Governor
Whitman Militia Is Doing
Needed Work on Border
By Robert J. Bender.
(United Press staff correspondent.)
Asbury Park, X. J., Oct. 14. Condi

and the government will soon be able
to do more in relieving the militiumen
now on the bonier, President Wilson de
clured in a letter to Governor Whitman
of New York, made public today. At
present, however, need for troops still
exists.
"From the beginning of the difficul
ty which necessitated the cull for mili
tia," wrote the president, "1 have been
deeply sensitive of the inconvenience
caused to the members of these citizen
militia organizations by their separa-"lzcd
tions from their families and from their
ordinary business engagements and pur
suits. "In order to minimize these sacrif
ices, the war department is sending to
the border from time to tune militia
which have not participated in service
there, nnd as each fresh Contingent goes,
Oenerul Fuunton selects for return to
home stations such units ns in his judg
ment can best be spared. This policy
will distribute this duty over e.s wide an
area as possible and make its burden
fall as equally as practicable upon or
ganized militia forces. The emergency
which led to the call of the militia was
the possibility of aggression from Mex
ico and protection of our frontier- This
emergency still, unhappily, exists and I
am advised by the military authorities

One of These Head: "Which
Goose Laid the Hughes
Golden Special Egg?"
Portland, Ore., Oct. 14. Amazonian
warfare raged in the street of Portland
today as women supporters of Hughes
and Wilson clashed repeatedly in pitch
ed verbal battles.
The old days of militant suffragist
exploits in England were recalled wheu
flying squadrons of Wilson women heck
eled campaigners from the Hughes spe
cial ' meeting cries of "vote for
Hughes!" with screams of "We want
Wilson!" . .
All down town street meetings except
one were cancelled nt the last minute
in an effort to defeat- the well nlannd
democratic series of counter demonstra
tions. .
The location of tho street . meeting
was kept secret. Flying brigades of
Wilson women -paraded the sidewalks
watching tho automobiles loaded -with
Hughes supporters.
At Sixth and- Alder streets an anti
prohibition speaker was haranguing a
small crowd. Vp dashed a big automo
bile bearing Mrs. Katherine 1. Edson
of I.os Angeles and Miss Elizabeth Free
man oli Seattle. t ,
The "wet" speaker-was pressed into
service to introduce the ladies: -
Dr. Marie Equi, a local suffragist and
Wilson supporter, started speaking from
a soap box directly across the street.
Her Crowd drowned Mrs. Edson 't first
words with cheers for Wilson..
The Hughes crowd was silent, atten
tive- The Wilson women were .noisy
and demonstrative. Dr. Equi soon ceased
her speech in derision of the so-called
"golden special" and assumed the role
of yell leader.
Police strove to keep the moving
crowds separated while those gathered
about Miss Edson 's machine vainly
tried to hear what she atd.
More Wilsoa automobiles, loaded with
pretty girlg who scattered democratic
literature among the Hughes crowd,
wedged into the throng. Police made
them move on.
Soon, however, the crowd was too
dense for more muchiues to move. Then
the Hughes women attacked in battle
formation. Three huge automobiles load
ed with women from the special train
drove up and led in cheers fur Huubes-
Miss Frcomnn started speaking while
the Hughes women apparently bad tho

Vhen the HugheB machines slowlv

dear governor, for the spirit iu which
these men hnve served nnd are serving

to have it supposed their retention on

completing their military training or,
indeed, any less commanding purKse
than tho preaervution of our frontier

SIIUS BROKEN
Commissioner Wilson to Try
New Plan of Returning
Men to Work
Biiyonne, N. J., Oct. 14 Convinced
they hnvo broken the strike of several
thousand oil workers In which three per
sons have beeu killed and scores injured,
Bayuiuie officials today planned to turn
the workers back to their tasks through
un entirely new departure in the hand-
linit of such situations. A monster meet
ing of strikers nnd those who refused
to take chunees of violence by staying
on the job, was called for this morning
by Commissioner or i'uulic Snicty n'n
ry ilson.
' Wilson plunnod to address the strik
ers on a big open plain known as "the

companies that nil will be given back
their places.
The plan admittedly was an experi

authority now prevails, following the

looting, every avaiiume policeman was

WILL BE HQ PEACE
IF ALLIES INSIST
ON LATEST TERMS
Germany's Greatest Editor'
Says Germany Can't Be
"Knocked Out
IF ALLIES WAIT FOR THIS
PEACE WILL NEVER COME
All Wilson Could Do Is To
Suggest Meeting of
Special Envoys
. By Carl W. Acker-man.
(United Press staff correspondent.)..
Cologne, Oct. 14 "If those Jellowi
make , peace only when Germany ia
'knocked out' then we will never make
peace." 1
This emphatic declaration came today
from Earnest Posze, chief editor of the
Cologne Gazette and . probably Ger
many 's greatest editor. His 32 years
connection with that powerful journal
makos him perhaps the best unofficial
spokesman of the empire in replying to
L.ioyu-ueorge's recent statement to the
United Press that the war must bo on to
a finish.
"For weeks the allies have conducted
a press campaign against peace, espe
cially at Washington," said Poaze,
i uey nave said repeatodly that ther
will be no peace until wo are broken,
until they reach the Rhine. ,
"These statements have strengthened
our position enormously. In my opinion
the military situation is better today
than it was a year ago. The allies will
never be able to broak the west front,
while the situation on othor fronts may
improve. The people are filled with
confidence in Hiudenburg. " .
i'.,Cnn President Wilson make peace)"
he was aaked. . 1
"This waria so enormous that meth
ods for bringing peace, which applied
formerly, do not apply today," he replied-
"An international congress can
not settle it. The only plan is for Wil
son, through ambassadors, to suggest
that special envoys meet In Washington
but I do not believe this would succeed
now. .
' Can't Consider Allies' Term.
"The allies want peace on their owi
terms, which we certainly will not con
sider. Here, as elsewhere, there are
pcuce-at-any-prico folk, but the German
people as a whole want peace only when
we can exist as a nation."
Three things, the Gazette editor con
siders essential for peace, so far aa Ger
many is concerned.
First, the military situation must be
considered, he said. Germany must Yol
low nismarcK a policy of protecting her
western boundary, perhaps by taking
the French fortress of Belfort, and, aa
the chancellor indicated, bIio must have
an independent Poland' on her other
frontier to protect her against Russian
aggression.
Second, Germany must develop and
protect her agricultural resources so
that she will no longer be dependent
on Argentine or Russia for wheat or
cattle. She must protect her indus
tries so she can exist in the event of
another war without outside aid if
iieceKsnry.
Third, Germany must consider her
international position and must have
colonics.
l'os.o believes that Chancellor Von
Betlimann-Holhvcg will retain his post
for the remainder of the war despite the
attacks of his critics. Field Marshal
Von Hiudenburg, ho feels, is tho koy to
the whole situation and so long as Hin
denburg and tho kuiser joiu with Holl
weg iu opposing unlimited submarine
warfare, it will not be renewed.
