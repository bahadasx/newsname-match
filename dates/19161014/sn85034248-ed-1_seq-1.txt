Lesson for very Father in Triangle
Drama.
"What an yOU doing for your
i'hat i_ the big question many a
father will ask himself after he has
seen the new Triangle feature, "The
)ivildend," in which Wm. J. Thomp
son and Chas. Ray will be seen at the
Guen Theatre zuday.
Frank Steel, is a good boy. He has
no inclination to go wrong. He has
made a good record at college, and
came home prepared to make his fa
tihei's interests his own, and learn the
ways of business. But his father,
John Steele, president of a gigantic
corporation, is simply too busy to pay
any attention to Frank. He dis
misses the lad with a half contemp
tuous admonition to go and play.
Irank doesn't like dissipatiorc and
after a whirl or two he returns to
his father, and again appeals to him to
give him something to do-something
useful, even though it be at thcivery
bottom of the ladder. Again he is re
fused, and this time, thoroughly dis
heartened, he plunges deep into the
life of the nightworid, and sinks into a
morass of evil from which there is no
hand to rescue him.
When his father's corporation has
paid its record dividend, the elder
Steele receives another dividend-the
limp form of his dying son. And not
even the magnificent mission he has
built in the slums, out of the profits of
his all-engrossing business, will com
fort him.
"Reggie Mixes In."
In "Reggie Mixes In," a Triangle
feature starring Douglas Fairbanks
which is to be shown at the Gem to
morrow, Reggie Morton, a wealthy
young man, is tired of the shallow set
in which he moves, although his
fiancee, Dorothy Fleming, is a mem
ber of it.
One day he comes upon a little Ital
ian girl, lost, and sitting on the curb.
He takes her back to her home in the
slums, and there he finds the red
blooded people he has been looking
for. He makes the acquaintance of
Agnes Shannon, a dancer in a cheap
cabraet, and determines to make her
his very own. He is prevented from
proposing to her by his obligation to
Dorothy, but to his great delight, up
on returning home, he finds Dorothy
in the arms. of another. He breaks
Agnes, becomes her "steady."
Agnes, however, has another ad
mirer, Tony Bernard, a gang leader.
Bernard sends a number of henchmen
to beat up Reggie and get him out of
the way, but Reggie whips them one
by one, throwing the man with the
gun through a window at Bernard's
feet. From that time on, Bernard's
determination to "get" Reggie is fixed.
At last he gets the young fellow in a
corner, and prepares to do his worst.
Reggie proposes that they go into an
empty room adjoining, and there have
it out, the man who survives to get
the girl. Bernard agrees. The re
sultant battle is one of the most glori
ous scraps ever shown upon the
screen.
"The Apostle of Vengeance."
Wm. S. Hart, noted Triangle star,
will be seen at the Gem next Satur
day in "The Apostle of Vengeance," a
story that is different from anything
in which he has heretofore appeared.
"The Apostle of Vengeance" is a
tale of Kentucky mountain feudists
and has been handled with the real
ism characteristic of Ince pictures. Its
many tense scenes are framed in set
tings of unusual picturesqueness, thus
combining two of the most important
elements in photoplay production.
Hart is cast as David Hudson, a
minister who is the eldest son of a
sturdy Kentucky mountaineer. rTe is
brought face to face with the proflem
of choosing between avenging the
death of his father, killed in a feud
battle, or abiding by the scriptural
teaching that "To Me belongeth ven
geance and recompense." His deci
sion forms the big scene of the story
and how he succeeds ultimately in re
storing order among the warring fac
tions is forcefully depicted through
out the remainder of the play.
A Test That Failed.
The Donaldsonville Chief asks
'some astute fi ncier to explain why
it is that the l naks of New Orleans
are reducing t ;ir interest rates on
savings from and 3 z per cent,
while the Shreveport, Opelousas and
other Louisiana banks are increasing
the rate from :3 to 31/ and 4 per
cent." That was explained, while the
question was still being asked. Cer
tain big city banks put up the bluff
that owing to financial conditions the
rate must be reduced, but certain oth
er city banks promptly advertised in
terest on savings at 4 per cent, show
ing plainly that the financial condi
tions were not absolutely prohibitive
of a better rate for the individual
saver, but were most likely due to
the world-old condition that "they
will take who have the chance, and
they will keep, who can."--St. Fran-.
tieville True Democrat.
The Louisiana Delta.
The New Orleans Valleygram,
Published by the Association of Com
merce" of that city, describes the Lou
Isiana delta as "that portion of south
ern Louisiana south of a line drawn
on a map from the north shore of
e Pontchartrain through Baton
ge, to the north shore of Ver
oiin Bay. The delta country com
prises over five million acres, or about
eig thousand square miles of the
mos fertile lands known to man."

"The Love Girl."
Ambrosia is a sweet little girl, of
tender heart and loving disposition,
who lives near to nature in fancy and
ideals. Her mother dies, and she is
smnt to an aunt in the city.
The aunt is of dignified and austere
disposition, far different than Ambro
Iia's dead mother, and the atmosphere
is a decided change from the freedom
of country life and, the tenderness of
mother love. Ambrosia makes friends
with the boy next door, and these two
greatly enjoy their romps together.
Ambrosia's cousin is in love with a
poor young man. Her mother ob
jects to his attentions, desiring for
her daughter an advantageous mar
riage, regal ess of the il's wishes
or thoughts f love. "A t Grouchy"
is a discip of Hindu rifystics, and
consults the "Swami," seeking his aid.
The "Swami" practices hypnotism
upon "Aunt Grouchy's" daughter, in
fluences her to send a note breaking
ofl the affair with the young man, and
finally kidnaps the girl and holds her
for ransom. Ambrosia and the boy
next door discover where the girl is
held a prisoner, and inform the po
lice.
While the den of the kidnappers is
being raided, the "Swami" is at
"Aunt Grouchy's" in the act of col
lecting the ransom money, under
guise of a tribute to the Buddhist's
god, but when the, secret service men
arrive and arrest him his true char
acter is exposed.
The raid is accomplished at a criti
cal moment, the girl is saved from
harm, and when "Aunt Grouchy's"
eyes are opened she realizes her past
shortcomings. Conquering her proud
disposition, she gives her sanction to
her daughter's marriage to the poor
yqung nMaora Ambrots Iivfhvpy
ever after.
This is an outline of "The Love
Girl," a Bluebird photoplay announc
ed for exhibition at the Grand Thea
tre Sunday, with Ella Hall playing
the stellar role.
Geraldine Farrar in "Maria Rosa."
In "Maria Rosa," which will be the
Monday attraction at the Grand, Ger
aldine Farrar, illustrious star of the
singing and silent stage, has reached
her greatest histrionic triumph.
'Maria Rosa" provides wonderful op
portunities for an artist of the first
class. A great and abiding love,
great simplicity coupled with great
cunning, are the chief characteristics
of the part. Miss Farrar makes the
conjunction of these elements in a
woman's heart seem overwhelmingly
probable because she makes them ov
erwneimingiy reai. one uoes uecume
merged in the character she is asked
to portray and the audience is there
fore treatedro the rarest o pleasures
-seeing a s blime part i the hands
of a highly gifted artist who realizes
the utmost expectations of the drama
tist.
The story brings home a fact which
we all know, but which is ever new
the power of love over a woman's
heart and whole existence. The heart
of Maria Rosa, simple and trusting,
ainds itself cruelly deceived. and be
trayed, not by her lover, but by a
treacherous rival of her lover. She
is called upon when she makes the
fearful discovery to act quickly and
to dissemble feelings which beat
tumultuously at the very gate of her
soul. With the same intuitive flash
she realizes both the deceit that has
been practiced upon her and the need
of saving her beloved from the sus
picion of murder. She rises to the
situation in a manner which will make
thi; play stand out far above every
average production.
'Tie tragic points in the film are de
veloped with unsurpassed skill, mak
ing the happy ending all the more
pleasing. Atmosphere and lighting
effects are up to the highest Lasky
standards.
Mme. Bertha Kalich in "Ambition."
Madame Bertha Kalich, inter
nationally famous dramatic artist,
will appear at the Grand Tuesday in
a master motion picture drama en
titled, "Ambition," a story of politic
al intrigue in typical American life.
Marian Powers (Mme. Kalich) is
the wife of an ambitious assistant dis
trict attorney. He is hopeful of pro
motion by the political Boss of his
town. The Boss does not think well
of Powers and declares he intends se
lecting another man for the office
sought by Powers.
Mrs. Powers, hoping to aid her
husband, decides to lay siege to the
heart of the Boss and does so, with
the result that the Boss falls in love
with her and she with him. Their
relations, however, are entirely pla
tonic.
Powers encourages the Boss's at
tentions to his wife and seeks in every
way to leave them together. Thq
Boss inadvertently lerns that Pow
ers is willing to sacrike his wife for
his own selfish ambiti'n. The Boss,
in spite of his affectioQ fr Mrs. Pow
ers, does not sanctionitke promiotlan
of Powers. Mrs. Po Fealis the
utter unworthiness fier hustand
and leaves him.

Sessue Hayakawa in "Alien Souls."
"Alien Souls," a most interesting
Lasky production in which the famous
.Japanese actor, Sessue Hayakawa, is
featured, comes to the Grand Wed
.,esday. The story is not only inter
esting and original, but is exceeding
ly well told and altog her caluclated
to awaken both the terest and the
sympathy of the audi ce. As in the
other great productio "The Cheat,"
the settings of Japanese interiors and
c teriors are of singular charm and
neauty.
The theme tells of the childish folly
of a pretty Japanese maiden, who,
though betrothed to one of her own
I ce, longs for recognition from white
society. She is altogether guileless
and is easily deceived by the preten
;ions of an impecunious adventurer
who Makes love to her and offers to
marry her. Her Japanese lover, splen
hdly impersonated by Sessue, vainly
appee Is to her loyalty. The little girl
iintuated and is about to fall into
the snare prepared by the wily ad
venturer when at the last moment her
poverty is revealed. Her white lover,
who had hoped to recoup himself with
the girl's supposed great fortune,
loses all further interest in her. She
feels disgraced beyond all hope and,
acting up to the traditions of her
country, she seeks to destroy herself.
If you believe in happy endings as
an absolute necessity you will have
no trouble in forgiving the strange
finish of the play.
"The Strength of the Weak."
Her father, dying by accident, com
mitted Pauline D'Arcy, a country
girl just budding into womanhood, to
the keeping of an elderly man as her
protector and legal guardian. Her
brilliant mind craved education that
she might fulfill her desire to achieve
a successful literary career.
The man who was charged with her
protection made her a victim of his
own desires. This price paid, the girl
entered college, plunged into her
studies and hoped that forgetfulness
would come with the lapse of time.
During graduation exercises, when
she was leading her class-mates in car
rying the "daisy chain," her eyes met
those of a handsome young man and
a pure love was instantly created.
By fate's remorseless dictum the
young man, whose love was reared to
.Indee or
of the man who had prevailed upon
her youthful ambition, by the false
promise of a craven, and dragged her
down. Too late she learned the truth.
There might have been a chance to
curb the great and good love she had
for the younger man, had she known
his parentage at the beginning.
Would she open her heart and tell
the truth to the man she loved? How
could she hide the dread secret from
the father who knew better than any- I
one else how grievously she had been
wronged? Just what the girl really
did will be disclosed at the Grand
text Thursday, when the great prob
lem-play, "The Strength of the
Weak," will be the attraction. Mary
Fuller will play the intensely emo
tional leading role.
"The Light at Dusk."
The Grand announces as its Friday
offering "The Light at Dusk," a re
markable Lubin production in which
Orrin Johnson is featured. One of
its most gripping points is the bold
but not unskillful introduction of the
supernatural element. A man steeped
in sin an seUiiisiiiess is ivuautu Lu a
realization of his folly by an appari
tion of Jesus of Nazareth. We have
heard of old legends employing such
visions, but on the modern screen at
least the idea has never been em
bodied before. The task for both di
rector and actor was an exceedingly
delicatone, and it is due to them to
say that they performed the task both
delicately and reverently.
Though the feature is nearly seven
reels irtlength and though at times
there are episodic digressions, it gains
a firm hold on the spectator's interest,
curiosity and sympathy, and this
hold is never relinquished for a mo
ment. The compassion of the au
dience is often roused in a wonder
fully clever way, there is never a
false move.
"The Light at Dusk" is a big sub
ject done in a big way.
A Blind Man Can Ma a Will.
"There was at one ti a disposi
tion to give a restricted meaning to
the term 'in the presence of the tes
tator,' " says Judge Allen, delivering
the opinion of the North Carolina
supreme court in re Aldred's Will,
86 Southeastern Reporter, 1047, "and
to hold that it meant 'in the sight of
or within hte scope of the vision'; but
as it was soon seen that this narrow
construction would prevent a blind
man from making a will, and that it
excluded the operation of the other
senses, except that of sight, a broad
cr and more liberal construction has
been generally adopted, and it is now
well settled that a blind man may
know of the presence of the witness
without sight, and that he may ma e
a will."
State vs. Martin, 2 La. Ann. 667,
is cited as a notable case in point.
Francois Xavier Martin, for thirty
one years a member of the Louisiana
supreme court, was totally blind the
last eight years of his life. His testa
ment was sustained despite the con
tention that a blind man could not
make a valid will.

The following article contributed

"Roanoke, Va., Sept. 28, 1916.
"To The Avertiser:
"The comparison of 'catalog house'
prices featured in the advertisement
of N. Abramson in a recent issue of
the Advertiser is deserving of more
than passing notice. In thus explod
ingr the current belief among the buy
ing public that catalog or mail order
louses undersell the home merchant,
Mr. Abramson is not only boosting
hi; o~wrr business but he is also con
ferring a benefit upon his fellow-mer- f
chants along with the general public.
This is individual effort of a broad
and constructive character, and be
cause it embraces in its results the
public good as well as the good of the
individual directly concerned, activi
ties of this kind "Fre always to be
commended and encouraged. They
contain the element of vital principle
of the law which underlies all real
progress in the life of communities
and of nations, which is that in
dividual initiative and effort find
their highest expression and fullest
reward in the life and character of
the community in Which they are ex- -
erted. It is the w.y of the world to
give back in overflowing measure to is
every man and woman whatsoever he, ts
or she, puts in,, the world; and for
tunate indeed is the one who is con
;cious of this great fact and utilizes Li
it in good ways.
"The question of buying at home yr
is one of very personal interest to
every man and woman in the com

factor in the material prosperity and
social advancement of every com- o0

subject has upon their future welfare. cE
"Patronizing local industry builds fr
up a community and insures its Ti
prosperity. This applies to business in

as well as to their customers. It em- ci

local enterprises as it is the duty of M
the individual citizen to patronize

"Being fair to local enterprise is st

"If there are many slackers, we s5

A Friend's Tribute.
It is a pleasant privilege both on
our own account and that of the good
old parish of Ascension to be able to
quote the following from a letter re
ceived recently from our esteemed
friend and former fellow-parishioner,
Theo. S. Landry-"Tod" Landry, his
intimates love to call him-for a
number of years past a prominent
citizen of Jefferson parish, where he
manages the large Willswood planta
tion for the Jefferson Planting and
Manufacturing Co., Ltd.:

now lies with Denmark, where there
seems to be considerable opposition to
the sale. The chances are, however,
that the liberal price offered for the
islands by our government will be
accepted by the Danes.

CHIEF'S SUGGESTION APPROVED
Consideration of Proposed Amend
ments Made Easy for Voters.
The New Orleans Daily States, in
its issue of Oct. 5, devotes its lead
ing editorial to an approval of The
Chief's suggestion concerning the
division of the proposed constitution
al amendments into specified groups
for the purpose of facilitating their
consideration by the voters. The
States says:
" 'An intelligent way for the voter
to consider the pending constitutional
amendments is suggested le The Don
aldsonville Chief. It is to \roup them
in three parts of six each eanwhile
assuming that all eighteej were sub
mitted by more than a two Ihirds vote
-n each house, which is a reasonable
presumption that each possesses some
merit.
"In the first group The Chief would
pat the six amendments which are
pureiy local in character, five of them
froai Orleans and Ode sixth from Cad
do. The Caddo ainoiemcnt covers the
funding of certain debts of the city
of Shreveport. The Orleans amend
ments look to the construction of a
bridge across the river, abolishment
of the fees of the district attorney, au
thorizatiop of the local levee board to
build a L)awall on the lake, enlarge
ment of the powers of the civil dis
trict court and the refunding of cer
tain debts of the city.
"The Chief properly holds that
electors of the remainder of the state
will be justified in assuming that local
needs and community welfare prompt
ed the framing and support of the
measures by the delegations from
Caddo and Orleans and, therefore,
that they should be approved. We
venture to confirm this with the state
ment that the Orleans amendments
will be overwhelmingly supported in
this parish.
"Six other amendments cover ob
jects concerning which, in the opinion
of The Chief, there can be no appre
:iable difference of opinion among the
people, of the state. These refer to
Confederate pensions, the funding of
the penitentiary indebtedness, requir
ing railroad and other public service
-orporations to maintain general of
fices in Louisiana, exempting certain
barge and steamship lines domiciled
in Louisiana and engaged in overseas
trade and commerce from taxation,
and extending the powers of the rail
road commission.
"Therefore, there are only six
amendments which properly can pro
voke discussion, and, hence, little
room for confusion in the mind of the
voter. These six give women the right
to serve on boards, repeal a section
of ,. article 118 relative to juvenile
courts, provide for the voting and
levying of taxes in aid of fairs, pro
hibit the general assembly from pass
nig local or special laws on certain
subjects, authorize salaries instead of
fees to clerks of courts and other of
ficials, and create a board of affairs to
have jurisdiction of assessments for
..tate purposes.
"If the voter will follow the advice
of The Chief, decide to vote for the
first two groups and so dismiss them
from his mind, he will have little room
for perplexity. Of the last group on
ly the last two amendments are likely
to trouble him. Their merit is undeni
able. They deserve to be ratified for
the general good. But certain inter
ests are carrying on a surreptitious
campaign against them and the voter
will do well to be on his guard against
the misrepresentations which will be
made concerning them.
"One of the amendments must be
passed if the pledges of the Demo
cratic party to wipe out the system of
fees are to be made good. The other
must be passed before there can be
any equalization of assessments or
my guarantee of adequate revenue
to meet the essential needs of the
state."

er, two sisters and two brothers, thi
bride's grandfather, Jas. P. Bowman,
and her aunts, Mrs. W. J. Fort, Miss

Muse, Mrs. Louise Kilbourne, Mrs.
O. D. Brooks, of St. Francisville, and

Mr. and Mrs. Fernandez left on
the noon train for New Orleans,
thence to some unnamed elysium for
their honeymoon, before going on to
their home in Tulsa, where the bride
groom is an esteemed and prosperous
citizen. West Feliciana bears him na
ill will for capturing one of her love
ly maidens, but rather wishes that for
tune and all things good may be
showered as freely as West Feliciana
sunshine upon both him and his bride.
