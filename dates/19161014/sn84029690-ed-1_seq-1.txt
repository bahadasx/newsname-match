Candidate for State Senator.
C. W. Miller, Republican candidate
for state senator from the 33th district,
made the Cap Sheaf a very pleasant
call Tuesday evening. Mr. Miller is a
very pleasant and agreeable gentleman
I to converse with. Altho he spent an
hour in our office he spoke no detrimen
tary word of his opponent. We feel
that it would be advantageous for the
voters of Gove county to support a man
who is interested in this section of the
state. As far as capabilities are con
cerned there is no one in this senatorial
district better fitted to fill that office to
the perfect satisfaction of every tax
payer than Mr. Miller, and we owe it to
ourselves to bring this important office
as near home as possibte. Grainfield

District Court.
Court adjourned Wednesday night,
subject to call.
In Shuber vs. J. P. Brown a verdict
by the jury was in favor of plaintiff.
A new trial was granted.
Stout against Quint was not tired.
Demurrer to the answer was sustained.
Hennarich vs. Snyder was tried out
partly by the jury. The jury was given
a long list of questions and upon the
answers ths court decided in favor of
the plaintiff. Dr. Hennerich bought Dr.
Snyder's residence on contract. Some
money was paid down and some ad
vance paj-ments were made. Then
there was failure to pay on the day
set, some talk, back and forth and ex
tensions granted. After a while a ten
der of the whole sum was made and
refused. If the case does not go to
the Supreme Court, Dr. Hennerich will
have possession of the place in thirty
days. He will also get $35 a month
rent as damages from May of this year.
There was a hung jury in the case
of State against Frank Chapman. He
was charged with stealing over $200
from Henry Schrenkler.
The $500 paid into court" by Mrs.
Hoffschneider is still a source of anxi
ety. The court decided it still belong
ed to her and that Carl Hoffschneider
never accepted the gift. The question
will nov.r be checked up to the Supreme
Court.
Anderson Comes Out Strong for Bjnton
Democratic leaders in Kansas arc
greatly depressed over their failure to
stir up factional trouble among tli2 Re
publicans of the Sixth District. Evtr
since the primary they have been try
ing to promote an insurrection there.
But they have made a dismal failure.
Reports from nearly every county in
the Sixth District to Republican state
headquarters show the Republicans
firmly united for the entire ticket from
president down to coristable, and enthu
siastic in their support of every Repub
lican candidate.
R. M. Anderson, of Beloit, was in
Topeka yesterday consulting Chas. H.
Sessions, chairman of the Republican
s:ate committee, in regard to speaking
dates during the campaign. Mr. Ander
son is a forceful speaker and has agreed
tcTgive the entire month of October to
the cause. Ke will not only speak in
the Sixth district, but elsewhere in the
state. Ex.

Special Meetings.
If you have not been attending the
special meetings at the Methodist
church, you have missed a number of
fine services. Perhaps there ha3
never been such an interest shown in
revival meetings in the history of our
city. The first five days have seen nine
cenf es3 Christ. The power of the
spirit is being manifest and men are
asking for light.
If you want to hear a great choir of
more than fifty voices sing the song of
soul life come out to the meetings. If
you want to hear gospel sermons coroe.
If you want to learn the way of eternal
life come. Next week will open to all
a chance for christian worship. See
the program for the Sunday services
under the Methodist notes.

The Evolution of fledicine. !
Quite a number of American people i
have heard of a book called Webster's J
Dic.ionary. In this book will be found '
the following: "Medical of, pertain-;
ing to. or dealing with the art of heal- j
ing disease, or the science of medi-;
cine." !
The evolution of medicine if described
and related iri any degree of detail, j
would make a vast library.
As far as history lights the mi-.tyi
past of the human race, we trace the '
practice of medicine. The ancierts. as j
well as our present day savages, attrib
uted disease to some form of sin caus-
ing the displeasure of some mythical j
god, who vented his wrath by causing '
great physical suffering. Insane peo
ple were supposed to have been aban
doned by good influences and turned
over to the powers of darkness.
In the scriptures we read
possessed of demons and devils. Peopl
having violent, unchained tempers, in j
ancient times, were believed to be pos- '
sessed of one or many devils. This 1
isn't very difficult to believe even now. '
We find that at the first blush of ,
dawn in history, there were those who ;
were believed by the mass of people !
(whether they convinced themselves, j
we do not knowj to have the power to j
heal. !
Of course, special education was not :
thought cf m these early days, the j
power to heal usually being hereditary
or the healer's work indicated to him
from some mysterious god, or the other
fellow. Disease was lured away by
chants and dances, beating on gourds j
or cocoanuts according to the geography
but a lot of valuable space has been
wasted because you've all seen it at
the movies.
All through the ages, religious be
liefs and physical and mental ailments
have been closely associated. This is
still true in some degree among all
classes and races. Many people do not
believe in doctors at all when they are
not ill but watch them when they
think they have appendicitis!
It has always been the conviction of
the masses, a3 far back as history and
tradition illuminates the past, that dis
ease was caused by some agent usually
of unaccountable or mysterious origin,
entering the body from without. Be
cause of this logic, thousands of differ
ent kinds of mixtures and concoctions,
poisonous and otherwise, in the ages
past, have been swallowed in attempt
ing to destroy this foreign agent with
in the body and cure the ailments of
man.
The first real light was thrown upon
conditions existing in disease when, on
ly a few decades ago, germ life was
discovered. This discovery, at the
time, made the physician's task look
simple. Just find the drug that would
destroy the germ and the patient would
be well. It was, however, soon dis
covered that body tissues were more
easily destroyed than bacteria. It was
further perceived that healthy people
were not susceptible to bacterial infec
tion, this being true there must be
some cause for the germs being pres
ent other than just opportunity. Still
! farther investigation made evident the
fact that the tissue must first be un
healthy before germ life could exist
within the body.
This again put our great medical
scientists in the air. It had been re
vealed that instead of germs causing
disease, disease caused the germs to be
present. In other words an individual
does not get sick because bacteria have
invaded his body but bacteria invade
his system because he is sick.
Great dissension has arisen in the
ranks of the medical profession in the
last century and much of it since the
discovery of germ life. The drug prac
tictioners have split into severel schools,
such as the Alcpaths, Eclectics and
Homeopaths, each according to its
belief in the manner of administering
drugs. Some of the progressive mem
bers of the profession the most promi
nent of whom was Dr. Andrew Taylor
Still who served &s a sunreon in the
civil war, contended that if it were not
possible to destroy germ life within
the body with drug3 that they were
not necessary at all. He believed that
by some injury to the body, overwork,
colds, accident or anything that caused
interference with the normal working
of the organs was the primary cause of
disease through rendering the body
weak and suceptible to the invasion of
germ life.
Upon Dr. Still's theory has been
builded the osteopathic profession of
today, and things are being accom
plished that the founder did not dream
were possible at the time he announced
his revolutionary ideas. Adv.
