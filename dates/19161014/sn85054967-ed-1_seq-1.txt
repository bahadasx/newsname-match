An Enthusiastic Greeting
Decked in national colors and alive with patriotic fervor, In

"Fighting Tenth" regiment on their return Wednesday evening,
when thousands of friends of the members of company F of Indi
ana and Company L of Blairsville greeted the boys as the regi
mental special arrived at the local stations. Headed by the brass
bands, Civil War veterans and patriotic orders, a large procession
met the Company L boys and escorted them to the armory. Later
a banquet was served to the soldiers after they had had a few
moments to greet the members of their families.
Indiana, which boasts of having the youngest commander in
the Tenth regiment in Capt. Charles McLain of Company F gave
the homecomers a rousing reception. An hour previous to the ar
rival of the troop trains whistles were blown and bells rung, sum
moning the residents of the town to the streets, where a big pro
cession was formed, marched to the Pennsylvania station and wel
comed the soldiers in a most enthusiastic manner. Escorted by
the Indiana Military band, members of Post No. 26, G. A. R.,
and Indiana camp Spanish-American War Veterans the returning
soldiers were escorted to the armory, where they were relieved of
their havy luggage, preparatory to an informal reception and
banquet in Odd Fellows' hall- Hundreds of persons from county
towns which supplied some of the members of Cmpany F and L
took part in the welcome at botli Blairsville and Indiana.
BATTLE FOR TRIESTE,
REOPENED BY ITALIAN
OFFENSIVE, IS GAINING
-ROME, Oct. 12— The battle
for Trieste has been reopened
by the Italian offensive against
the Austro-Hungarians.
Dispatches from the front to
day stated (that material pro
gress has been made towards
this objective, but .that the Ita
lians are compelled to attack
powerful defensive works which
the Austro-Huns have erected.
Fighting is particularly se
vere beteween the Vipacco riv
er and Hill No. 208, south of
Gorizia. It was at that point
that the Italians penetrated the
Austro-Hungarian lines and cap
tured more than 5,000 prison
ers- %
The renewal of the Italian of
fensive comes at a time when
the Roumanians are hard press
ed by the Austro-German arm
ies and may have the effect of
drawing reinforcements from
the Roumanian front thus weak
ening the pressure against King
Ferdinand's troops.

publican candidate for United States Senator, would be in Indiana
on the evening of Thursday, October 26, as the principal speaker
at a Republican Mass Meeting, preparations for w T hich have about
been completed-
County Chairman Wilson is arranging a schedule of meetings
to be held in the County, the rally to be held here will be the crown

SERIOUS AUTO WRECK
A miraculous escape from death, and as it w T as, resulting in
serious injuries to the driver, occurred Tuesday evening about 5
o'clock on the turn from Oakland avenue onto the Saltsburg Pike,
Christ Willey, a trained nurse, left towm for a short spin. The ma
chine was traveling at a fast speed and in negotiating for the turn,
the machine struck the stone abutment at the culvert, sheered up
the embankment and completely overturned, pinning dowm the oc
cupants.
Passersby rescued the couple from their precarious situation
and rushed them to the office of Dr. E. E. Shaulis. Mr. Willey re
ceived a bad cut on his head and 14 stitches were required to close
the wound. His daughter received a slight cut on her face and
was painfully bruised. Two wheels of the car were torn off, the
windshield broken and the top smashed, but the motor continued
to run.
At least seven accidents have Occurred at this point, four of
them this summer and it is quite likely that a sharp protest will
be sent to the State Highway Department, demanding that the
curve be eliminated.

WILSON IS GIVEN
ROUSING RECEPTION
BY RAILROAD MEN
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 11—
President Wilson, who was in
this city for 18 minutes this af
ternoon waiting for his private
car "Mayflower" to be attached
too a western express train in
street station, heard
about 300 Pennsylvania railroad
employes, the majority of them
in uniform, shout that they in
tended to vote for him. The rail
road men's noisy welcome was
the result of the Adamson eight
hour law for railroad men. For
nearly every minute of the 18
Mr. Wilson leaned over the brass
rail of the observation platform
and shook hands with a file of
conductors, brakemen, engine
men, yardmen and others who
marched past. Pullman car por-'
ters, waiters and cooks also
were welcomed with a Wilson
handshake.
"I am for you Mr. Wilson," was
what dozens of the railroad men
shouted up at the president as
he shook their hands.
The two cars were pocketed
on a track between two empty
trains. The trainmen surged
down the platform and Mr. Wil
son, clad in a gray suit and
bare headed, was ready for
them- Railroad police whipped
the enthusiasts into line. In the
lapel of those n<jt in working
clothes were Wilson buttons and
small emblems worded: "We
win with Wilson."

KLINGENSWITH CHARGED
WITH ARSON AND ROBBERY
William Klingensmith, a young
electrician of Oakland avenue,
was arrested Saturday noon,
last, on charges of arson and
robbery, growing out of the Bon
Ton fire, and now occupies a cell
in the county jail. The arrest
was the climax of a week's in
vestigation that had been con
ducted by Deputy State Fire
Marshal Clyde W. Seanor and
B. W. Ford, assistant superin
tendent of the Pinkerton Agency
at Pittsburgh. Suspicion was
first attracted by the fact that
the wire screening had been cut
from the rear door of the Bon
Ton store with pliers that are
used principally by electricians.
In his conversation with other
persons the thread of the crime
vvas traced to the unfortunate
young man. His actions for the
past five years have not been
exactly sane and many little in
cidents are being recalled of
queer actions carried on at dif~
.
ferent times.
Two typewriters were recov
ered from the Klingensmith
home, also a telephone, a dozen
or so whisk brooms, spools of
thread, thimbles, nail files and
other trinkets; three pairs of
shoes, taken from Christy's
Shoe store, several safety razors
and pipes taken from the R. W.
Wehrle store- The typewriters
and telephone were taken from
the Indiana Ladder factory. An
other typewriter is said to have
been taken from the Wehrle
store. His mania appeared to be
for typewriters and trying to
sell one of the typewriters last
Friday suspicion was aroused
and led to his arrest the next
day. In searching the attic of a
small building in the rear of the
Klingensmith home, many arti
cles were found that had been
taken.
PENROSE THE STAGE
MANAGER
That was another nice,
ing jolt handed the progressives
and independent Republicans in
this section Saturday when
Bois Penrose designated Beidle
man, his handy man, to look af
ter the arrangements for Mr.
Hughes' five-minute visit to
this city tomorrow. Are pro
gressives still in doubt that a
vote for Hughes is a vote for
Penroseism Jin tfiie state land
Beidlemanism in the county, or
must a house topple over?
