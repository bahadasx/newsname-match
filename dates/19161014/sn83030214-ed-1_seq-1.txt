Cancer from X-Ray Destroys
Dr* Satterlee's Hand by Inches
Stump of Finger To Be Amputated in Third Operation to
Halt Deadly Growth?Roentgen Expert Used
Lights T\venty Years ,
Dr. Francie Le Roy Satterlee, jr_ of
218 Percy Street, Fluabing. will un
dergo on Tueaday at the Flushing
Koapltal an operation for cancer of the
hand, which ia believed to have been
caused by exposure to Roentgen ray*.
Already two operations on the mlddle
finger of the right hand bave left him
with only a *tump. That will be ampu?
tated at the knuckle, and, if tbe oper?
ation ls not efficacious, it may be nec?
essary to remove the band.
Since 1897 Dr. Satterlee, who is the
son of Dr. Francis I** Roy Satterlee,
of 6 West Fifty-aixth Street, and a
eousln of Herbert L. Satterlee. haa
been a student of *radiology. He is
radiologiat of the Greenpoint and
Flushing hospitals.
Teata I'rodured Cancer
In the pioneer daya of the X-ray its
baneful effect on the akin was not rec
ognized or beeded. It waa cuatomary
to teat the raya by exposlng the hand
of the operator. Like hundreds of
other physicians, Dr. Satterlee adopt?
ed thia method of aacertainlng the
strength of the medium he was using.
Few of the hundreds who may have
been using the X-rays ln those early
days, however, were so constantly ex
posed to their influence. Although
since his graduation from Columbia
and St. John's College, at Annapolis,
Pr. Satterlee has taken up the gen?
eral practice of medicine to some ex
tent and surgery to a considerable ex
tent, his hobby has been the study of
the Roentgen rays.
Within the last year or two what ap?
peared to be warts developed on his
right hand, particularly upon the fin
DEAD LAD IN HIS ARMS,
BOY THINKSMM "SICK"
Rescuer Carries Traffic Victim to
Drug Store, Then Disappears
Alfred Habbager, thirteen years old,
of 600 St. Ann's Avenue, carrying a
smaller boy in his arms, walked into a
drug store at 655 Westchester Avenue,
The Bronx, yesterday.
"I think tht kid must be sick," he
said. "Maybe you can fix him up."
After imparting the further infor?
mation that he had found the "kid" on
the car tracks at Westchester and St.
Ann's Avenue tbe boy disappeared. The
"kid" was beyond fixing by any drug
gist. His skull had been crushed in
and the body already was cold.
At the morgue the body was identi
fied as that of five-year-old Adolph Sil
verman. of 751 Kast 165th Street. De
tectives from the District Attorney's
office and the 5th Branch Bureau believe
that tho "kid" was run over by some
vehicle which didn't stop to see how
badly he waa hurt.

Government Points Way to Beat
High Price of Flour
Washington, Oct 13. General use of
potatoes in making bread is reeom

Department of Agriculture. Bread
containing boiled and mashed potatoes
was found through experiments ju?t
concluded to be just as nutritious as
ordinary bread and to have the quality

The department believes that in lo

economy can be practised by reason flf

prices of potatoes and flour are sueh
that there is no economy in aubstitut

to the usual treatment, and a few
months ago, after consultation with
other physicians, be became convinced
that they were a phase of X-ray derma
titi.
Suspecting those on the mlddle finger
of his right hand were cancerous in ef?
fect, be submitted to an operation
whieh took the digit off at the first
joint. It waa soon apparent that the
operation had not had the desired ef?
fect, and another joint of tha finger
was sacrificed. Although beneflcial in
aom. cases, X-ray treatment has no ef
I feet on canccrs caused by the rays.
Deadly Growthe Reappear
Within the last few weeks the
| growtbs have reappeared. Yesterday
j Dr. Satterlee consulted Dr. Robert
I Abee, of 13 West Fifteenth Street,
senlor eurgeon at St. Luke'a Hospital
i ar.d a cancer expert. It was definitely
j established that tbe growths were can
! ceroua and the eondition known as
keretosls was present.
The operation on Tnesday will not
only removo tha remnant of the ?f
' flicted finger, but will explore the palm
j of the hand in an effort to remove la
tent cancerous growths at the roots.
Although himself oceupying the grim
role of subject in a demonstration of a
somewhat rare phnse of radio-activity,
t Dr. Satterlee fliflwa with equaninnty the
approach of an operation which will
almost certainly take from his right
; hand its surgical s-kill and m_y fail tfl
check the ravages of the rays that were
his servants twentv years ago. After
the consultation with Dr. Abbe it was
admitted it might be necessary to am
putate at the wrist later.
Dr. Satterlee is married and has two
children. He is about forty yeara old.

[Br TalefTiph t? Th* Trltron* 1
Hridgeport, Conn., Oct 13.?An essay
written by the late Field Marsha' Lord

"There is one aspect of the great
European war with whieh, ao far as I

"I am one of thoae who hold that
this war wbs virtually necessary to all
of the nations cngaged in it., as well as
to those who are standing aside and, it
is hoped, learning lessons. The his?

that at the moment when countries ar
rive at overcivilization something must
happen, and that something is war.
Degeneracy Follows Over-CivllUatlon
"As soon as nations become over
civilized degeneracy sets in. The tirst
set of persons to be attacked is that
whieh forms the government of the
country. While it is true that govern?
ments are never representative and
politicians are merely parasites, even
under the best conditions, it is aston
ishing how quickly the example of their
dishonest self-seeking and inefficiency
runs through the nations whieh they
do not represent. It is very natural
for a man let him be British, French.

"A general carciessness sets in, like
a blight. It spreads to the younger
generation. and a diseased country is
very quickly brought to the condition
4vhen it must either die or be onerated
upon. It is the inevitable law, both of
nature and nations. Then comes w-ar
the tinal test.

phcenix from the flames. War places
it upon the operating table and cuts
out of its body the raneerous growths

the convalescent nation makes a new

"Paeifism and the de^.T" for nseifism

'GOODBY' U-53
FLASHES; SEEN

Stops
Neutral Liner
100 Miles from
Scene of Raid.
While torpedo boat destroyers, un?
der orders of Admiral Mayo, com?
mander of the Atlantic fleot, were
zigzagging their way along the New
England coast from Newport to the
Canadian line yesterday in search of
hidden aubmarine bases or radio sta?
tions, a neutral ship arrived in New
York Harbor with the news that a
German submarine, believed to have
been the U-">3, was sighted in Ameri?
ean waters as late as Tuesday.
The submarine was spoken as it
was moving in an ea.terly direction
more than one hundred miles off
Nantucket Lightship. The submer
sible wirelessed the ship, asking her
name and nationality. Tho informa?
tion ?was given.
"Who are you?" waa the messagfl
then sent to the undersea craft.
"German submarine from New?
port," came the reply. "Goodby."
Bovic Sight. Submarine
Previous to this the last seen of the
U-53 was on Monday morning, when the
Greek liner Patria atghted Tier.
While a high marine authority
vouches for the correctness of the news
brought by the neutral ship, her name
cannot be disclosed owing to the neu
trality regulation of the nation whose
flag she flies.
Hard on the heels of this information
came a wireless message via Boston
from the steamship Bovic, bound for
New York from Manchester, England,
stating that she had sighted a subma?
rine at 8 o'clock yesterday morning at
latitude 40.17 north and longitude 6'..1_
west, which would place the aubmersi
ble about 1*00 miles due east of New
York. The identity of the aubmarine
was not established, and it is thought
it may have been an Ameriean craft of
the K or L type.
Wireleas Is Kept Tlusj
If ar.y further message was sent bv
the Bovic, tho censorship placed by
tho Navy Department j-i a'l wireless
news prcvented the messa<-r from bcin-.
given out. It became knovn, though,
that a long series of eo le BBflBflflgfla
vere flashed all day between Washing?
ton and the nnval sta'icns along the
North Atlantic coast. The^c probably
had to do with Admiral Mayo s report
to Washington of his ordfll to the de?
stroyer* to seek out hid.len bases and
radio stations.
Naval ofticials at Washington ex
pressed the belief that Admiral Mayo
had no definite information which led
to his order, but inasmuch as general
orders were issued to the fleet at the
beginning of the war to take all steps
necessarv to safeguard Ameriean Bflfl*
trftlity, some were inelined to attach
more importance to his report. Sflflffl*
tary Daniels made it plain that the ad?
miral had acted on his own mitiative
and that, so far as the department
knows, he has no intention of extend
ing his search south of Newport.
No further word was received at
Washington from Admiral Mayo after
his report, which arrived early in the
,!av, and this was taken to mean that
Bfl violations had ao far been uncov

U-53 Raised No New Issue
withU. S.y Lord Cecil Says
Shows American Waters Are Not Outside War Zone, He
Asserts?British Answer Rejects Blacklist Protest
_Holds War Nullifies "Equality" Treaties
London, Oct. 13.The operations of
i the German ?ubmarine U-53 off the
Ameriean coast raises no new issues,
' as far as the British government ia
i concerned, in the opinion of Lord Rob
! ert Cecil. Minister of War Trade, who
; discussed to-day the latest develop?
ments of the relations between Great
Britain and the United States.
Lord Robert declared that thia form
of warfare on merchantment violated
international law ai it was recognized
by Great Britain and thfl United States
in the days before the war, and was
' still objectionable to Great Britain, but
; no more so than when lt ls done on
this aid. of the water.
May Modlfy Blarkllflt
Referring to reports of meetir.gs be?
tween Sir Richard Crawford, commer?
cial attaehe of the British Embassy at
Washington, with Ameriean bankers
and busineas men, Lord Robert aaid no
departure in principle has been made
from the Rritish blockade measures,
but it could be safely said that the
general policy leaned in the direction
of a modification rather than an ax
tenaion of the blacklist.

OVER 50 IN FIGHT
Allied Fleet Attacked After
Bombing Mauser Plant
in Germany
London. Oct. IS. Franco-Bntish and
German aeroplane squadrons fought
over German soil last night what is
regarded as the greatest set battle that
ever has taken place in the air.

forty French and British machines.
loaded down with explosives, aet out
from the West front and made off tow

great height.
I.ess than three hours later the huge
squadron was cireling o.-er the town of j
Oberndorf, on the Neckar River, more
than 120 aftlflfl from their starting
'point. Having got their bearings and
locat.-d the Mauser rifle works, they
?flrooflfld down in small groups and at
close range hurled more than four tons
flf bombs on the great factories.
Ilardly had the first shells been
dropped before a dozen or more Ger?
man aeroplanea took the air to drive
otf the raiders. The furious battle that
followed was among the most dramatic
of the war. Nine Allied and six i,er
? man machines plunged to earth, riddled
with bullets, before the engagement
came to an end.
The attack on the Allied raiders was
made from the land as well as the air.

done. Five persons wera killed and
tw.nty-six wounded by bombs, Berlin

by the (ierman airmen.

t provisiona of the Anglo-Ameriean
treaty of commerce and navigation of
1815 by granting lieenses to Japanese
and French exportera, while refusing

' treatiea lost validity during a atate of
