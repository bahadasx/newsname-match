STATE'S ATTORNEY MACLAY HOYNE RAIDS THE CITY HALL IN THE
MOST SPECTACULAR AND SENSATIONAL MANNER. HIS ASSIST
ANT TOTED AWAY THE PRIVATE PAPERS AND PUBLIC DOCU

OF POLICE CHARLES C. HEALEY AND ASSISTANT CHIEF MAJOR
M. L. 0. FUNKHOUSER IN HIS EFFORTS TO SECURE INDICTMENTS
BY THE GRAND JURY AGAINST CHIEF HEALEY.
The first of this week Governor Ed
ward F. Dunne, for the second or third
time stretched forth his hand of mercy
and prolonged the life of ' ' Chicken Joe "
Campbell, reprieving him until Friday,
December 8. "Chicken Joe" Campbell
was convicted in the summer of 1915,
'or ending the life of Mrs. Odette
Allen, wifo of Edmund M. Allen, who
was at that time Warden of the State
Penitentiary at Joliet, Illinois. His
life was to end on this earth Friday,
October 13, this new act of clemency
n the part of Governor Dunne un
mistakably shows that he is more than
inclined to be fair in dealing with his
Unfortunate fellowmen. Lawyer F. L.
Harnett and the other attorneys who
Uo assisting him free of charge feel
that by that time they will be able to
raise enough money to move onto the
Supreme Court of this state with
"Chicken Joe" Campbell's case and
by the way right here we desire, to
state without any blowing about it
that the writer has humbly assisted
Mr. Barnctt just a little bit in that
direction, not because we feel that
"Chicken Joe" Campbell is innocent of
committing that crime or any other
crime far from it but we honestly feel
that he didn't have a fair trial, there
fore he is entitled to have his case re
viewed by the Supreme Court of this
Btate and after all the evidence in the
case is properly presented to that court
of last resort it might see tho wisdom
of granting him a new trial.
In moving on it must be admitted by
all those who pretend to know any
thing about the political situation in
this city and state and public men and
measures that the present chief exec
utive of Illinois has alwayB been friend
CHICAGO,
ly disposed towards the Colored race.
It must also be frankly admitted that
in the past he has closed his eyes real
tight and very coldly turned his back
on some of the best friends he ever
had among the Colored race in this city
and throughout the state of Illinois;
that in eo doing ho made some very
serious mistakes or bad blunders in
selecting several Colored men as the
greatest or the foremost representa
tives of the Afro-Americans who were
a long ways from being what they rep
resented themselves to be at any stage
of the game and the big round fat
facedjjolitical preacher who has never
been -straightforward in his dealings.!
with anyb'o'dy in his life "when it comes
("down to easy money and politics and
a little loud mouthed rattled brained
friend of this same tricky political
preacher both posed before Governor
Dunne as the two greatest representa
tives of the Colored race in tho world,
but today when the Governor needs all
the friends and every vote that he can
command in order to pull through at
the polls in November, that same polit
ical preacher who was never known to
deal honestly with his fellow-men when
it comes down to money and politics
and his little side partner are abso
lutely silent, their lips are sealed tight
and neither one of them are raising
their little finger in any manner, shape
or form to assist Governor Dunne in his
fight for re-election which simply proves
that they are traitors to the hand that
fed them and befriended them and
showered honors upon them in every
way.
Will the Rev. Hon. Archibald J.
Carey, Ph. D. D. D., the unreliable
political preacher who on one occasion
declared from his pulpit in the Insti
tutional church in the presence of Gov
ernor Dunne, that "he would willingly
and cheerfully walk up to the battle
ments of hell for him" which caused
the members of his flock to shout
Amen! Amen! preach the truth Brother
Carey, and the Hon. Thomas Wallace
Swann please stand up and lead us in
prayerf
The many friends and supporters of
Governor Dunne contend that the grave
mistake or error which he made in that
direction was not made by or from his
warm heart but from his head, that
may be true.
There is one thing however, that is
absolutely true and that is that many
thousands of Colored people residing in
all parts of this state will record their
votes in favor of his re-election, owing
to his well known friendship for the
Colored people and at this time and
in fact at all times tho Colored race
needs all the strong friends that it can
make and hold among the members of
the opposite race regardless of their
politics.
This coming Saturday evening, Octo
ber 14, a great meeting and moving
picture show will be held at Odd Fel
lows Hall, 3335 South State street in
the interest of Governor Dnnne. J.
W. Hardy will serve as the head
spokesman and master -of ceremonies.
During his short talks pictures of
Governor Dunne will be thrown on the
screen showing him as one of the
Judges of the Circuit Court of Cook
County in 1901, absolutely refusing to
send a Colored woman with a littleipaM. Taa Star of Zion, Charlotte, N.
baby in her arms to the Pen at Joliet.
OCTOBER 14t 1916
Illinois; as Mayor of "Chicago from
1905 to 1907, he will be depicted in
showing his friendship for the Colored
people by appointing them to office
and refusing to preside at the Benja
min R. Tillman anarchistic meeting at
Orchestra Hall, Tuesday evening, No
vember 27th, 1906, which required a
whole lot of courage and manhood on
his part to turn his back on a United
States Senator.
The mjjsi striking and most impres
sive of all the moving pictures repre
sents Governor Dunne in the act of
laying the corner stone of te .EighthJ
Reeiment Armory, '35th street andL
forest avenue the first part of Octo
ber, 1914. The Eighth Regiment Illi
nois National Guard passing in review
in all their military glory led by its
famous band.
The other pictures show the Govern
or freely mingling with the Colored
people at the Coliseum in this city dur
ing the Lincoln Jubilee in the summer
of 1915, and in the act of reprieving
Elston Scott, of Murphysboro, 111., un
til Sheriff Whito of Jackson County
gives his word and honor that he will
not transform his execution into a free
show or holiday.
The Hon. Charles Boeschenstein,
member of the Democratic National
Committee from Hlihois who holds
forth at the western headquarters of
the National Committee, Karpen Build
ing, 900 S. Michigan avenue and who
is ever ready to extend the glad hand
of welcome to all comers; scents vic
tory in the air for the re-election of
Wilson and Marshall and tho entire
Democratic ticket of Illinois.
Not much will be said at this time
in relation to the spectacular and sen
sational raid of State's Attorney Mac
lay Hoyne on the City Hall the first
part of this week and his assistants
toting away the private papers and
public documents belonging to Mayor
William Halo Thompson, Chief of
Police Charles C. Healey and assistant
Chief Major M. L. C. Funkhouscr, in
his effort to fasten some crime upon
Chief Healey. If the State's Attorney
secures an honest indictment against
him, well and good, but if he fails to
do so then he will be deserving of the
severest condemnation of all the peoplo
residing in this community.
THE TWENTY-FIRST ANNIVER
SARY EDITION OF THE BROAD
AX.
Our "Secular" contemporary The
Broad Ax, (Chicago, 111.,) struted out
last week in new clothes in celebration
of its Twenty-first Anniversary. The
Broad Ax ha9 reached its majority is
of age, and naturally feels its indepen
dence. It looks well in its white duck
suit, and justly feels proud of the
grand and faithful services it has ren
dered tho race in the twenty-one years
of its existence, and the self-respect it
has had for its own honor. '
The Star of Zion greets the able and
efficient Broad Ax with cheer and con
gratulations of sincercst spirit. May
it live long to champion the cause of
an oppressed down trodden and de-gpised-xace,
and contribute to the relief
of tho situation as the years slowly

HON. EDWARD F. DUNNE.
As one of the Judges of the Circuit
and Governor of Illinois he has
the Colored people.
THE RACE CONGRESS WHICH MET
AT WASHINGTON, D. C, SENT
FORTH THE FOLLOWING AD
DRESS TO THE COUNTRY.
The address follows in part:
"For many years after the close of
the Civil War, peonage was practiced
in the South which has never become
thoroughly reconciled to the laws pre
scribing equality of citizenship. This
fact is seen in the widespread efforts
to defeat the great War Amendments
by the enactment of laws making tho
disfranchisement of the race a prac
tical reality. Separation of Colored
passengers from all other racial ele
ments on common carriers, proscriptive
legislation, residential segregation,
lynching of thousands of Colored men
and even women .charged with offenses
never proven in the courts of justice,
has become almost a National disease.
These social disorders are the after
math of slavery and we appeal to all
fair minded men and women of the
enlightened .moral forces of the coun
try, to unite in a nation-wide effort to
correct these abuses to the end that
justice may prevail in all sections of
our common country."
After reciting the great progress of
the Colored race and its usefulness to
tho country in industry and war, tho
address continues:
"Wherever the door of opportunity
has been opened the race has demon
strated its ability to meet the xaot
No. 4
Court of Cook County, 'Mayor of Chicago
in many ways proven his friendship for
exacting requirements of our civiliza
tion. The race has made valuable
contributions to science, invention, art
and literature and its achievements in
our national wars have maintained at
a high level the best military tradi
tions of this nation.
"We desire to express to tho friends
of liberty and justico our grateful ap
preciation for every service of any
character which they have rendered in
the past. We seek nothing but justico
and that equality of rights and that
equal opportunity which aro denied to
none of the other groups in this country-
"We denouce the segregation of
Colored employes in tho civil service
of the Federal Government as un
American, Unjust and wicked, shame
ful and disgraceful abuse- 0 power.
"We denounce the spirit of thoso so
called representatives of the people in
fno halls of Congress, who aro con
stantly seeking to re-citizenizo tho race
by the introduction of reactionary
legislation which belongs to tho past
age and which the great body of Amer
ican people have outgrown."
Tho speakers at Thursday night mass
meeting were: Prof. Kelly Miller,
William D. Brigham, Boston, Mass.;
Dr. William A. Sinclair, of Philadel
phia; Rev. Reverdy C. Ransom, Mrs.
M. C. Simpson, of Boston; Miss Nannie
Burroughs, Washington, and Morris W.
Spencer, of Delaware, who read the ad
dress of the eosatry.
