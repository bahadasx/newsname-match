International News Service:
WASHINGTON. Oct. U. Compli
cations between the United State
and the entente powers will come to
a head within the next week. Al
ready the Joint refusal of Great
Britain and France to accept the
American construction of Interna
tional law as applied to mail is before
the state department. The reply to
the demand that the British black
list he abolished Is enroute from
Indon. It In effect Mates that this
action is of no concern to the United
Mates as "it i3 a legitimate measure
of defense."
It is stated in official quarters that
Pres't Wilson probably will take no
bteps to dehne the position of the
United States in either matter until
after lection. Then, if re-elected,
lie will take advantage of the em
barc authorizations conferred on
him by the shipping bill and the
general revenue bill which passed in
the closing days of congress. But
"whether he willutillze this weapon
In the event of his defeat naturally
is known only to himself.
Is Critical Period.
The next six weeks promise to be
most critical in the history of the
United states. Although the danKer
of complications over German sub
marine operations on this side of
the Atlantic overshadow the mail
und trade questions, which deal en
tirely with dollars and cents, it is
accepted that any drastic action by
the administration to demand its
rights as it understands them under
its construction of international law
at the hands of Great Britain will
lead to further resTment there,
"where Wilson methods are not too
popular at present.
In connection with the submarine
situation reports have reached sev
eral government departments that
the operations of the U-53 were not
the first on this side of the ocean.
Certain vessels in "admiralty ser
vice" pljing between Canadian ports
and Great Britain with supplies, are
i-aid to have been chased by sub
marines within 10 days and at least
one is said to hae been sunk. These
reports naturally are impossible of
contirma' ion here because of the
iuct thai the British naval officials
in Cai.vda maintain their censorship.
Searching for I tax.
It is admitted, however, that
British warships and destroyers have
been searching "or more than a
months along the bleak and unin
habited coast of Labrador and at
other points of the Canadian coast
lor a German submarine base sim
ilar to those Uncovered oft" the coast
of Scotland early in the war. This
ba-e. or bases, according to reports,
was established from the United
State.
And while the British and Amer
ican fleets continue to make inde
pendent search of their own coast
lines for submarine bases, othcials
here say that even though they are
located within the United States
there is no lav -vvhich proides any
drastic punishment for their estab
lishment on American soil.
Good Chance to t-caic
Any prosecutions that might take
place, it is stated, would be limited
to such narrow lines that those re
sponsible would hae a good chance
of escaping punishment on technical
ities. It is exr-ected that as a result
of this discovery comprehend ve laws
covering every phase of such a sit
uation will t-e asked by Pres't Wil
son of congress when it reconvenes
in December.
Up to the present all of the reports
from the naval othcers who are von
ducting the search for the rumored
hubrnarine bav on American soil in
dicate that none ha been discov
ered. If German submarines have
been supplied off the American coast
omrials say the;, were probably
taken rare of by privately owned
a"hts asalnc whose wnr no vi-
dTire Is possible. And so far as the
U-Ü3 and F-51 are concerned, of
ficials here believe that they now are
ell jn their way back to their home
International New Service:
NKW YORK, Oct. 14. The

BRANCH, N. J.. Oct. 14. One of
the features of Pres't Wilson's
speech to Pennsylvania democrats
this afternoon was expected to be
an adroit reply to Charles Evans
Hughes declaration as to what he
would have done in the Lusitanla
incident.
It has been the president's policy
to avoid any discussion of diplomatic
affairs in his political speeches, but
tli president's advisers feel that Mr.
Hughes allusion was of such a
character that a reference to it
should be made.
Eight special trains rolled in here
today brintjincr about 3.000 Pennsyl
vanians for this was "Pennsylvania
day" at the summer white house.
Seven bands filled the air with a
variety of music.
Pres't Wilson's advisers tre great
ly pleased over the result of his trip
to Omaha and Indianapolis. They
believe that all uncertainty as to
the trend in Indiana and Nebraska
Is now over.
The president has received re
ports from the middle west and has
expressed himself as gratified over
the situation there. Reports just in
from Ohio say that the outlook
there is pood and supporters of the
president believe that his speech in
Cincinnati on Oct. 2 will clinch the
situation in his favor.
Next Thursday Pres't Wilson will
speak in Chicapro and he plans tv
"cut loose" in that address to riddle
arguments advanced by Mr. Hughes.

International News Service:
RAYONNF, N. J., Oct. 1. Civil
warfare again flared up in full blast
here early today, after 12 hours of
calm. At three separate points bat
tles were fought between police and
strike sympathizers. The crack of
revolver and rifle shots again is the
predominant noise in this strife-torn
town
Mrs. Stephen Topp, 50 years old,
died of fright when the police en
tered her house to search for
weapons. She is the second woman
to fall victim to the oil strike and
is the fourth death. Mrs. Popp la
the mother-in-law of Stephen Pere
gerin, arrested in connection with
the strike. As she opened her door
early today to the police, who had
formed a strong cordon about the
house, a mob of a thousand rioters
gathered, surrounding the officers.
The police opened a volley from
their riot guns into the throng. At
the first shot Mrs. Popp clutched at
her heart and fell back on the floor,
dead.
Funeral Tills Afternoon.
Grave fears are felt by the police,
for what may happen today at the
funeral of Mrs. Sophie Karak, who
was shot dead Wednesday night
while watching riots from the win
dow of her home. The strikers
charge that the fatal shot was fired
by a policeman. A force of 150 po
licemen has formed a ring around
the house vhere th funeral is to
take place. A deadline includes two
houses on either side. All the male
lodcers have been ordered from
these houses.
Serious trouble also Is looked for
as a result of the strikers mass,
meeting to be held this afternoon.
The quiet that prevailed during the
night has caused the belief that the
meeting would end in a majority
vote to resume work. After this
morning's resumption of rioting this
is now believed improbable.
Oil Vngrrm Sont Out.
The signal for the resumption of
rioting was an attmpt by the
Standard Oil Co. to send out three
oil wagons from the company's
plant, relying upon the assurances
of the police that the situation was
well in hand. Bayonne firemen
dressed in police uniforms, guarded
the wagons.
A mob of a thousand strikers
threw itself In the path of the wag
ons. The firemen shot over the
rioters' heads, without result. Then
they aimed lower and shot to kill.
The rioters cut the harnesses of the
first wagon, the' animals dashing in
a wild gallop up the street, leaving
the vehicle stranded. More than
200 shots were exchanged before the
strikers finally dispersed.
Snipers fired at the police from
roofs and hurled bottles and bricks
at them.

PARKER ADVISES
InternAtton.il Nrws srrlce:
NKW YORK, Oct. 11 John M.
Parker, progressive candidate for
vice president. In a speech at the
Biltmore hotel this afternoon took a
bitter fling at Col. Theodore Iloose-
velt and urged the re-election of
rres't Wilson.
The reception, at which the
speech was made, was a notification
meeting as Mr. Parker had never
been officially informed of his nom
ination. Progressives were present
from different parts of the country.
Mr. Parker said he did not seek
the nomination, adding:
"I do not in the slightest decree
regret my action and infinitely pre
fer to have been one of those who
were duped by over-confidence
rather than being put in the posi
tion of violating a sacred trust and
again work are-in-arm with men
bitterly denounced in 1912 as guilty
of most of the political crimes on
the calendar, and as men who were
a menace to the future welfare of
America,
"True progressives have lived up
to their slogan, 'Pas prosperity
around. and as an earnest, ardent
progressive I offer another slogan
for 1916 'Leave well enough alone.
Feeling as I do. In every state
where we have a ticket, I urge every
progressive to step up like a man
and vote it, and in those states where
we have been betrayed by former
leaders and by those who weakly
carry out their future, to vote
their honest convictions and support
Woodrow Wilson for president of
the United States."

In hh recent conferences with

Carranza from power and, this ac

leave Mexico himself.
