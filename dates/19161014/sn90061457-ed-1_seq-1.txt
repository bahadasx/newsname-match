The Republican slush fund solicitors
will make mistakes, no matter how
shrewd they are, and in so doing they
will uncover their hand. That the
only hope of the Republicans Is to buy
the election has long been conceded
by all thinking men, for they never
can win It any other way; therefore
thoy must add to the already available
$3,500,000 fund which they now have
had contributed by the inter
ests in order that they may add to
their purchasing power their only
show and hope for success.
And while they are doing this, as
previously stated, they are bound to
make mistakes. This is only too well
shown when R. W. Austin, Republican
member of congress from Tennessee,
wrote a personal letter to our own
William P. Graham and asked hira to
dig up some dough In order to elect
the man who has no issue and uues
nothing except scold and find fault.

felt when he received It. It s need
less to say that so far his contribution
has not gone forward. Here Is Aus
tin's plaint:
Please Dig Billy
Mr. NV. P. Graham,
Si. Joseph, Mo.
My Dear Mr. Graham:
I have been asked by the national
republican congressional committee to
write you frankly regarding a move
ment we have on at. this time looking
to the election of a Republican senate
and house at the November election.
At the 1914 election a change rof
V from 33 to 960 votes In 32 different
r""r"r.V """'. ,""
h I vll U0 vuuuwi v. iuw j'swoi. iawuuv
by 29 majority. In two states a change
of but a few vptes would have given
us two additional United States sen
ators. That we will take no chance
that It will be so close again, we are
organizing now in over 200 close con
gressional districts.
To effectively do so we will need to
raise considerable money. Tho com
mittee has decided that it, will en
deavor to finance the 'coming cam
paign by calling on friends to con
tribute who feel as wo do, that tho
election of a Republican majority in
both branches of congress is of suf
ficient Importance for them to assist
us.
The committee would appreciate an
individual contribution from you to as
sist in carrying ou(. this work. We can
only succeed by securing the coopera
tion of those friends who are Inter
ested in our success. I am sure Mr.
Graham, you feel the Importance of
being able to pass such tariff and other
constructive legislation as will be nec
essary to the betterment of general
business conditions. I am taking the
liberty of enclosing one of our con
tribution blanks which we trust you
can fill out and return to our Washing
ton office.
jj. Very truly yours,
f..x R. W. AUSTIN.

Big Business Done the Holdup
Who held up the country? Tho

' realized 4E per cent increase in net
' earnings for the first half of 191C and
. refused to give their men any share

crease in freight rates. The holdup
was attempted by the Buccaneers of
Big Business, and congress called their
bluff. Nodaway Democrat-Forum,
HOW TO HELP
The Way that You May Assist to
Perpetuate Your Own
Prosperity
Democrats who have been con-
templatlng scratching sorao of
the candidates on their ticket, if
any such there really are, may
not learn until too late that they
have been ambushed by the
enemy.
There is no disaffection among
Democrats as to the record made
by President Wilson. It Is as-
sumed that all Democrats will
vote and work for him with all
their zeal and all their Influence.
Not one who votes for him will
be doing the president a favor by
doing so unless he votes also to
provide the president with the
working machinery that will en-
able hfm to carry out the com-
prehenslve plans he has outlined
for putting the people in com-
mand of their government, and
for keeping the hands of avarice
from the people's throats.
If a Republican congress should
be elected, it will, if the party is
not belleing Its purpose, undo
the good things that Wilson and
congress have done, and repeat
many of the obnoxious processes
that four years ago made the Re-
publican party a repugnant insti-
tution. For whatever that is good
for the "people President Wilson
may stand, that will a Repub-
llcan congress be against. For
whatever that is evil for the peo-
pie that may be opposed by the
president a Republican congress
will diligently strive.
What is said here in reference
to congress may be said with
equal truth concerning the state
government. Republican triumph
In this state will inevitably mean
a backward march in the prog-
ress that has been made In the
past four years, and a bulwark-
-
.pemocraUc government., ,,
Appeal is made to the friends
of the president to not only help
4, rc.cIect h,m but t0 also heIp h,m
do the splendid thlng3 he says he
wants to do. It would be a poor
privilege indeed to be a Demo-
cratlc president and be unable to
irrpat
program of legislation
I -i
which congress has enacted dur-
ing the, past four years, It would
be tho act of a dolt for him to
vote against a continuance of
that congress in power at Wash-
Ington. To be fair he must vote
for Democrats, In preference to
Republicans, for congressmen and
senators. No man who now re-
fuses support to Woodrow Wil-
son's Democratic program Is like-
ly to ever hereafter command
much confidence and respect as a
member of the party of which
President Wilson is the standard
bearer. And such men will be
far outnumbered by former Re-
publicans who have been won by
the quality of government given !
by the president and congress
and by a business administration '
of our state affairs.
THE LAMM SLAUGHTER
That Was About all that There Was
to that Great Republican Rally
Tuesday Night
After all of the noise and bluster
after all of that hiring of and parade
of bands after all of that chartering
of special lnterurban cars and special
automobiles after all of that news
paper advertising and the promiscuous
parade of advertising bands and the
expenditure of many a good slmeoleon
for fence and billboard advertising
that great Lamm rally In other
words, that of Its boosters was
really but the leading of the Lamm to
the slaughter in November.
From the prodigious preparations
that had been made for weeks by the
silk stocking contlngpnt o( the G. O. P,
(the cottons somehow not feeling well
or having a bad stomach not taking
part), the public had been led to bo
llevo that there would be something
out ofho usual taking place In St.

and his Missouri knocking aggrega
tion would bo hero and there was

THE REPUBLICAN PLEA
The Appesl that the Grand Old
Party Has Sent Out to the
Voters
To the Voters of the United
States:
. We, the Republican party,
being at our wits' end and desper-
ate, put it up to you:
For nearly four years now a
Democratic administration has
been in power. Contrary to every
law of reason, every principle of
progress; the country Is at peace
and alive nay, humming with
prosperity. Business is rushing.
Wages are high. The only dis-
content is the discontent of those
who are reaching for bigger
chunks of plenty.
We are flabbergasted. All this
has Tiappened during a period
when the rest of the world has
iieen agog, when International
crisis were impending on all
sides, when we would have sworn
only Republican statesmanship
could put the nation through.
No war has engulfed us. No
panic has paralyzed us. No na-
tlon has with impunity continued
to Infringe upon our rights.
We can't deny what has been
done. All we can do Is take our
oath we could have done It bet-
ter. How, we do not know. If
only we said it loud and long
enough we hoped the country
would believe us.
But the country is busy and our
voices grow hoarse. We are hav-
ing a hard time.
Woodrow Wilson has nothing
to show us but what he has ac-
complished. He has none of the
glamour of what-mlght-be. We,
on the contrary, have our old
promises and policies mellowed
by age, but still bearing the
stamp of the nation's sold inter-
ests: Protection, privilege, gov-
ernment by influence surely the .
country has not given them their
last trial.
Wall street is with us. Blir
bublufss-hr-wlrlr us. But. oh vot-
ers, we confess It, we need you.
Don't keep looking at the peace
and prosperity around you. Try ,
to get our point of view. What '
ever Wilson has done, the man is
a Democrat, and neither federal
government nor federal offices
were meant to be forever in such
hands.
Let's forget issues and talk as
friends. Turn him out and give
us a chance.
