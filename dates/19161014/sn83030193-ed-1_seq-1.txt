As more than (50,000,000 was In

President Wilson In n letter to ("low

that the emergency which caused the

"The emergency which led to
the call of the militia was the'
DOssibilltv of nnrireilion

our
still,
unhanoilv. exists, and I am ml
vised by the military authorities
that withdrawal of the militia at
any timo from the date of its

upon the lives and property of
the people of tho United States.
Militia havo therefore been used

of the highest quality and the
