HUGHES TAKES HIS
CAMPAIGN INTO MISSOURI
Save for One. Stop. He Spout the En
tire Day Traveling.
Joplin, Mo., Oct. 13. Charles E.
Hughes today took his campaign to
Missouri, the fourth of the states
that skirt the so-called - "solid south"
to be visited on his present trip. Save
for one stop, at Springfield, Mo., the
entire day was spent traveling. The
nominee reached Joplin tonight, near
ly three hours behind scheduled tnme
and addressed an audience in a big
tent, making his chief theme the pro
tective tariff.
Mr. Hughes told the crowd that the
present prosperity of the country was
built on sand, that "the intoxicated
fancy may indulge in happy dreams,
but the somer thought of the coun
try is directed to the day when this
stimulant the European war will be
no longer available."
He referred to "those who are seek
ing to make political capital out of
our present war prosperity," portrayed
in detail conditions, as he viewed
them, in the United States when the
war shall end, and assailed the demo
cratic tariff policy as a policy which
"means idle plants and impoverished
workmen."
At Springfield and again here to
night Mr. Hughes assailed the ad
ministration for the enactment of the
Adamson law.
"What are real laws " he asked.
"Real laws are passed after inquiry
with some understanding of the jus
tice of the case, some idea of what is
involved and ought to be. Sham laws
must be passed under duress. I am
opposed in the interest of labor to
government by holdup and I am for
government by reason and fairness."
Mr. Hughes' train was about three
hours late in reaching Springfield. The
audience which he addressed in Con
vention Hall had been waiting two
hours and a half and hundreds, unable
to find standing room, were turned
away.

STANDARD NOMENCLATURE
FOR AUTOMOBILE PARTS
Announced by the Society of Automo
bile Engineers.
New Tork, Oct. 13. Standard auto
mobile nomenclature was announced
here today by the Society of utomo
bile Engineers. A committee of the
organization developed tliis list of
uniform names for motor car parts
after holding meetings with engineer
ing and service representatives of
some of the leading .American- manu
facturers, and the resulting standard
ization of names and terminology is
expected to eliminate many delays
common in replacement of parts and
to make for clearness and brevity gen
erally. The society asserts that a
lack of a common and accurately un
derstood automobile language has
been a barrier in international busi
ness. Nineteen divisions of the automo
bile, from cylinders to bodies and ac
cessories, are set forth, these classes
being divider! into nearly 70 specific
groups, with the groups sub-divided
so extensively that between 600 and
700 separate parte are named.
The bodies of cars are standardized
into 16 types, the list describing the
differences which distinguish roadsters,
coupes, touring cars, sedans, limou
sines, landaulets and other varieties.
The society expects the national auto
mobile chamber of commerce and
manufacturers generally to adopt the
complete nomenclature.

Advertising Educates the Buyer
There is a whole lot of truth in the statement of one enthusiastic
advocate of advertising when says: "Advertising is education. It
Is telling the people the truth and therefore giving the .sound advice
regarding trade. The educational idea is the big idea of modern busi
ness, for it is the creative idea. It does not merely accept conditions
as they are, and make the most of markets. It makes its own con
ditions and in that process has first claim to the markets it creates.
The man who blazes the trail through the woods makes slow prog
ress, but the big prizes are his by right of discovery. . Others may
come, and, following in his trail gain a partial success; but they can
never catch him, and they must take what he leaves." y
, This is plainly shown in the case of those who do and those who
do not advertise. Get to the front and stay there by using the ad
vertising columns of The Bulletin the paper which goes into the
homes of the people of Eastern Connecticut.

Secretary Daniels made it plain to

his own initiative in sending out the
scouting craft on this mission, al
though when the European war be
gan general orders were issued to the
fleet commanders to take all neces
sary steps to safeguard American neu
trality. So far as the. department knows,
there is no present intention on Ad
miral Mayo's part to extend his search
south of Newport. Navy officials be
lieve he had no very definite informa
tion on which to act. It has been the
policy of the navy to investigate re
ports of secret radio stations along
the coast without waiting to deter
mine their creditability. Navy offi
cials have been impressed with the ne
cessity for running down such rumors
quickly to prevent violation of neu
trality. ....

ability, every' '1 nation - would have
known that that was meant; and, fur

respect to the action threatened, I
would have made it known in terms

nary diplomatic channels if that ac
tion were taken.

never have been sunk."

ALUNITE DEPOSITS IN
MOUNTAINS OF UTAH
Scientists Believe It May Develop
Source of Potash.
Washington, Oct. 13. Alunite de
potash in the mountains of Utah may
develop a source of American potash,
in the belief of government scientists
who have been conducting laboratory
investigations under direction of the
Bureau of Soils. The investigations
were prompted by the government's
desire to assist in developing 5 potash
to take the place of that formerly im
ported from Germany.
The scientists believe, however, that
capital might be wasted . needlessly
should efforts be made to develop the
potash industry in Utah without a
complete-understanding of all the con
ditions. They have concluded that if
a market also could be found for the
dther products of alunite ore beside
potash, namely sulphur and aluminum,
it probably would pay to develop the
industry. The ore is found only in
the Utah mountains and to bring it
out expensive tramways wctild be
necessary. It then would have to be
shipped many miles to a fertilizer
market. . i
