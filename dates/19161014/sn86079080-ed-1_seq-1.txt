Dear Editor:
Referringto the Re
pert of the Grand Jury which
appered in your Isaue of the 7th
nst., especially to that part
which reads:
'`We lwnmend that the audit
of the ls monthly by' the Pa
rish Auditor at $25.00 be discon
thied as we understand the
books are audited by-the State
every three months" while I deo

portant document as a Grand'
Jury Report is usually accepted
to ea.
If any proof is needed to show
that the office of Supervisor of
Public Accounts, thru its andi
tars, does not concern itself with
the Parish accounts. (although
according to Act 198 of 1414 it
should see that all Parish 'Taxes
and Licenses are properly ac
counted for) but is careful to see
that properaccounting of monies
belcnging to the State is rig dly
adhered to, it can be found in a
repch which ' have recently
