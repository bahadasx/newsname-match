ESTIMATES FOR D. C.
PRESENTED TODAY
Commissioners Submit Figures
for 1918 Far in Excess of Current
Year's Appropriation.
MANY PROJECTS COVERED
Estimates considerably in excess of
the appropriation of $12,575,877.10 allowed
by Congress for paying the- current
year expenses of the District of
Columbia were submitted to the Secretary
of the Treasury today by the Commissioners
for the fiscal year of 1918.
These estimates provide for improvements
in every part of the'city and for
important projects, such as a municipal
hospital.
The law requires transmission of
these estimates annually to the Secretary
of the Treasury by October 15 and
prohibits their publication until transmitted
by the Secretary to Congress at
the beginning of its session in Decern
ber.
Budget Provides Liberally.
It may be stated upon reliable authority.
however, that the budget provides
most liberally for the needs of
the municipality for the next fiscal
year. Practically all the improvements
recommended last year which were not
allowed by Congress have been requested
again.
The total appropriation urged is understood
to be in excess of that recommended
a year ago. which was $15,343,3
9'>. The appropriation bill as finally
approved by Congress cut this amount
to $12,575,877.10.
After considering requests from a
large number of citizens' associations,
the Commissioners have included in
the budget estimates for improvements
in every section of the city. New
school buildings are requested and an
extensive street improvement schedule
proposed.
Hospital and Garbage Plant.
Among the important improvements
again recommended are the building: of
a, municipal hospital and municipal
garbage plant. In connection with the
former no suggestion is made as to a
location. Last year's recommendation
was for an initial appropriation of i
$150,000 for work on the hospital, and j
a similar amount, it is understood, is
asked this year.
Need of a municipal garbage plant,
for which studies have been made and
plans drawn, is emphasized in the estimates
and an appropriation for starting
work on the project requested.
Collection and disposal of the city's
ashes, garbage and refuse are now
handled under contract.
The estimates are understood again to
recommend the purchase of the Dean
, and Patterson tracts for park purposes.
Last year the Commissioners requested
$625,000 for the Dean tract, between
Connecticut avenue, Columbia road,
19th street and Florida avenue, and
$500,000 for the Patterson tract, lying
north of Florida avenue, between the
grounds of the Columbia Institute for
the Deaf and Dumb and New York
avenue.
$200,000 Asked toi Reclamation.
For rushing work on the Anacostia
reclamation project the Commissioners
want $200,000. Until this year the annual
appropriation for this work has
been $100,000, but Congress, at the in- j
stance of the District heads, appro- j
priated $200,000 for this purpose in the
current appropriation act.
Thf estimates also are understood to
provide increased pay for members of
the fire department. That increases
be allowed was recommended by
Frank J. Wagner, chief of the department.
but to v.-hat extent the recommendation
has been approved will not
be known until the estimates are made
public in December.

SWISS EMPLOYES GET RAISE.
Parliament Vctes Salary Increases to
Meet High Cost of Living.
On count of the high cost of living,
the S'.viss parliament has increased the
saiar i s of a part of the employes In the
government service, according to a report
received from Consul W. H. Schulz
Ml li i Switzerland. Although the lav/
waii net passed until the latter part of
September, the clerks who profit by the
the legislation will receive the increases
from July 1 last.
The law provides for an increase in
the salary of every employe drawing less
than 3.400 francs, an amount equal to
$656.30 In this country. An increase
equal to S45 a year is provided for all
such employes. This action will result
in an increase of the salary budget of
the Swiss government of from 7,000,000
to 8.000,000 francs, or between 11,351,000
and $1,644,000.
J. M. PARKER URGES
WILSON'S ELECTION
Progressive Leader Scores
"Betrayal" of Party by
Roosevelt and Perkins.
PRAISES THE PRESIDENT
NEW YORK. October 14.?With a
plea for the re-election of President
Wilson. John M. Parker, progressive
candidate for vice president, delivered
an address here today at a reception
given him by members of the national
ugicaojvc (;ai ij, in w men lie uncu
somewhat at length on the part taken
by Theodore Roosevelt and George W.
Perkins In the efforts to get the progressive
and republican conventions in
Chicago last June to unite on a presidential
candidate.
Mr. Parker quoted Col. Roosevelt as
saying in 1913 that "I am for this
cause to fight to the end * while
life lasts." and that "T will never
abandon the principles to which we
progressives have pledged ourselves,
and 1 will never abondon the men and
women who drew around me to battle
for these principles."
He also quoted George W. Perkins
as stating he was opposed to returning
to the republican party because it
had been "more reactionary than ever."
Statement Accepted at Par.
"The statement of our leader," Mr.
Parker continued, "and the concurrence
of the chairman of our executive
committee were accepted at par by a
trusting body of men and women who
implicitly believed in our leaders. The
tragedy of the great geathering at
Chicago from June 7 to June 10, in( llioiuil
ia o m ottor r?f klotArv "
Mr. Parker said he had information
that every move in the progressive convention
was approved by Col. Roosevelt
over the telephone. As a member of
the committee on conference, he said,
when a request was presented by Mr.
Perkins from Col. Roosevelt that the
name of Henry Cabot Lodge be suggested
for President, "I emphatically
declined to be a messenger or carry
any suggestions to the republican committee,
as I recognized the right of no
mon to turn us over body and soul to
those same republican wolves against
whom lifelong republicans had revolted
in 1912."
The pledged word of honor of the
leaders, he said, "were mere scraps of
paper and practically show that political
honor is as little regarded as the
peace treaty of nations." He accepted
the nomination, Mr. Parker said, "with
the certainty that it amounted to nothing
politically except a "large volume
of both ridicule and vituperation."
He realized, he said, that if he declined
the nomination it would be
thought he was "a party to the betrayal
of the principles that brought
the progressive convention together."
Thanks Due to President.
"I am not a democrat," Mr. Parker
said, "but believe the thanks of this
nation are due to "Woodrow Wilson for
what he has accomplished in the shape
of progressive legislation that has
brought untold millions happiness and
j jjiwapn uy iu vur peypie.
He praised the establishment of the
regional bank as "one of the greatest
constructive pieces of legislation in the
history of the nation," and declared
that commerce and industry are thriving
here as never before. "I do not
claim that these results are due to the
progressive party solely." he added,
"but progressive thought, progressive
energy and progressive brain have cer- I
tainly helped to bring these things
about and to keep our nation at peace |
with all the world." He urged every
progressive to vote their ticket in
states where they had one.
"And in those states where we have j
been betraved by former leaders and
by those who weakly carry out their
orders," he said, "I appeal to every
thinking man and woman interested in
the material welfare of our country,
devoted to their family and their future.
to vote their honest convictions
and support Woodrow Wilson for Presj
ident of the United States."

Tomorrow Is Ladies' Day
in PlanogTavure Section
Tomorrow will be ladies' day in
the planogravure section of The
Star, for all four pages are devoted
entirely to showing pictures
of the latest feminine
styles, from shoes to hair dressing.
One of the features of the
i section Is a picture of an all- j
rubber rainy day outfit. The um- j
brella, the hat and the flowers (
upon It, and the coat all look atj
tractive.
Tomorrow's picture section will
be a riot of chiffons, tulles,
brocades, lace and other elements
that go toward making:
up fashionable pieces of apparel.
It will be educational, too, for a
! man. If he doesn't know the
names of some of the thing's he
hears his wife, sister or sweetheart
talk about, he can learn
tomorrow. The pictures all are
labeled.
So, tomorrow's planogravure '
j section will not be a case of
"ladies only." Mere man also
i may taste of the glory of clothes;
that is, if he can appreciate an
attractive picture.
TELLS WHY HE HOLDS
TROOPS ON BOROET
President Fears Withdrawal o
Militia Would Bring Fresh
Aggressions by Mexico.
LETTER TO GOV. WHITMAfl
DONG BRANCH. N. J.. October 14.President
Wilson, in a letter to Go\
Whitman of New York, sent Octobe
9 and made public here today, de
clared that the emergency whicl
caused the sending of the militia ti
the Mexican border "unhappily stil
exists." He added, however, that h<
believed conditions in northern Mexio
are improving, and that "in the nea:
future" it probably will be possibli
to "do more than has been done t<
relieve the embarrassments unde!
which organized militia regiments havi
necessarily suffered."
The President wrote to Gov. Whit
man in answer to a letter from th<
New York executive regarding th<
New York militia organization on th?
border. The President told Mr. Whit
man that it was impossible to set i
date on which the remaining Nev
York regiments there could be released.
In his letter the President declare*
he had been advised by the War Department
that a withdrawal of th<
militia at any time since they wen
sent to the border "would in all human
likelihood have been followed bj
fresh aggressions from Mexico upoi
the lives and property of the peopl<
of the United States.
The President paid a high tribute tc
the character of the militiamen on th<
border, and denied that any organizations
were being k^pt there to pcrfeci
their military training.
Text of President's Letter.
The President 's letter follows:
"My dear Gov. Whitman: I have re
ceived your letter of September 20 anc
have taken up with the Secretary of Wai
the situation as it affects the presence
of New York troops on the border. Fron
the beginning of the difficulty which
necessitated the call for the militia ]
have been deeply sensitive of the incon
venience caused to the members of these
citizen military organizations by theii
separation from their families and fronr
their ordinary business engagements anc
pursuits.
"In order to minimize these sacrifices
the War Department is sending to the
border from time to time militia which
have not participated in the service there,
and as each fresh contingent goes to the
border Gen. Funston selects for return tc
their home stations and mustering out
such units as in his judgment can best
be spared. This policy will distribute his
duty over as wide an area as possible
and make its burden fall ;i3 equally as la
practicable upon the organized militia
forces.
"It has already resulted in the return
of a number of New York organizations.
The 14th and 71st Infantry and
the 1st Briera.de headmiarters nr*? nt
present in their state armories preparing
to muster out. The 3d Infantry in
the state mobilization is going to muster
out, the 2d Infantry Is preparing
en route from the border to the state
mobilization camp, also for muster out.
Other Units Ordered Home.
"The 1st Ambulance Corps and the 1st
Regiment of Field Artillery have been
j designated to return from the border
to their state mobilization camps for
| muster out, and the 1st Aero Company
was not sent to the border, but mustered
out at Mineola, N. Y. Thus a substantial
number of the New York contingent
either have been or are in
course of being released from the federal
service at. this time, and as other
forces are sent to the border it may
well be that Gen. Funston will find il
possible to afford our New York militia
even further relief.
"The emergency which led to th*
call of the militia was, us defined in
my call of June 18, the possibility ol
aggression from Mexico and the protection
of our frontier. This emergency
still unhappily exists, and 1 am advised
by the military authorities thai
the withdrawal of the militia at any
time from the date of its original call
up to and including the present would
in all human likelihood have been followed
by fresh aggressions from Mexico
upon the lives and the property ol
the people of the United States. Tlu
militia have therefore been used and
are being used to repel invasion and
are rendering services of the highest
quality and most urgently needed character
to their country.
Impossible to Fix Date.
"It would, of course, be impossible t<
set a date at which the release of th?
remaining New York units can wit!
certainty be accomplished. I am happy
however, to believe that the conditior
in northern Mexico is improving am
that in the near future we will be abb
to do even more than has been done t<
relieve the embarrassments undei
which these organized militia regi
ments have necessarily suffered.
"I share your admiration, my deai
governor, for the spirit in which thes<
men have served, and are serving, thei:
country, and would be very sorry t<
have it. supposed that their retention 01
the border is for any mere purpose o:
completion of their military training 01
any less commanding purpose than th?
preservation of our frontier from ag
gression.
"Very truly yours,
(Signed.) "WOODROW WILSON."

Policemen throughout the city are 1

of police, "unless it Is found that
lieir parents will not co-operate to put c
stop to the dangerous practice." c
Motorists and drivers of horses fre- c
uently complain of the anoyances H
aused by children jumping upon or ^
fiking hold of their moving vehicles. >

"It s a case of 'all's well so long as v

There was a time, lie stated, when a h

"After all," he said, "it's a case of

Fatal Accident Suggests Action.
The accidental killing of little Alice ^

lis week suggested to the police the
dvisability of renewed interest in the
nforcemerit of the law that was deigned
as a safety first regulation. It
i stated that in many instances chaufiurs
and drivers permit children to d
ike hold of their moving vehicles, but ^
lis was not the case with the Heizer
hild, the chauffeur stated at the in- 1
uest. s
"Children using skipmobiles and those
n roller skates are pointed out as be- ,
ig a menace to drivers of all kinds of 1
ehicles," said Coroner Nevitt, who re- t
tiled that several fatal accidents have j?
ccurred to children who failed to ob- v
*rvo the safety first regulation.
"Too much stress cannot be laid on 11
le necessity* for enforcing an observ- \\

er At the-time she passed out of the sight
^j_ of the other two vessels ihe Danish
boat still seemed to be endeavoring to
escape from the submarine. The weather
n(U was clear and the Hellig Olav was be,er
tween two and three miles distant at

- the theme of the editorials of most of
the weekly reviews,
r "The overnight American isolation
d has vanished, says tne outlook, and in
- common with other reviews, this newse
paper discusses the elTect the subma

d The Nation takes the interesting: view
d that "having done something disagreeable
in the U-53 affair,'* Germany's
n next step will be to seek some favor
y from the United States, which, it says,
p may be a request for mediation, or posa
sibly only a request for an efTectiva
protest against the British blockade,
as a return for muzzling her U boats.
The Nation expresses the belief that
Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg, the German
imperial chancellor, still is asr
cendant, and that he. like the German
- people, would welcome mediation.
Tho Snertator considers the German
motive in sending the U-53 across the
" sea was to force the United States to
s propose peace terms, regardless of
c whether the entente allies wish them
. proposed or not.
j "Thus, with unrestricted submarine

! Spectator, "Germany gives America
i warning of what is likely to happen
. unless the United States is prepared
1 to declare that the war has reached a
I point where It is dangerous for nent

to play this role, the Germans will
