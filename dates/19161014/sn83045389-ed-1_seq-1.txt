BOSTON, October 13.?An unidentified
submarine off the New iCnglaml coast
was reported l>y the steamship Bovic
to-day at a time when the steamship
lane to Europe was dotted with muni
tion-laden ships Just released from the
embargo placed on their movements
after the German submarine raid off
Nantucket last Sunday.
The Bovic, bound ^from Manchester,
England, for New York, did not report
the submarine's nationality, but gave
its position when siuhied at 8 A. M.
to-day at about 'JOO miles due east of
New York, not far from the scene of
the U-boat activities of last Sunday.
The Bovic is due in New York late
to-night or some time to-morrow.
The reports of the strange subma
rine were coincident with the announce
ments that a Heel of British cruisers
and destroyers was off the coast, and
that virtually the entire available de
stroyer flotilla of the Atlantic Fleet
of the United States Navy was on neu
trality duly.
l.WKSTIOATK STOUIBS
OP SECRET BASES
That the American destroyers were
conducting an active investigation of
stories of secret submarine bases on
this coast was indicated in a dispatch
from Bar Harbor. Me., which said the
destroyer I'auldlng, sent out from the
Newport naval base yesterday, made an
exhaustive search of the coast between
Bar Harbor and Bockland to-day.
There was not a cove or rocky inlet
that escaped the sharp scrutiny of tho
destroyer's crew. At dusk the f'auldiug
put back to ltockiand. and itjwas under
stood that she had discovered noth
ing suspicious during the day. Those
of her men who were given shore
leave were ordered to report ready for
sailing at 7 o'clock to-morrow morn
ing.
Other destroyers known to ho off the
coast and believed to he engaged in
much the same work as the Paulding
are the McDougal. Fanning and War
rington. The McDougal, during the
evening, anchored at Kastport, in prox
imity to the Canadian border.
PERSISTENT KIMOliS
or III DDK X STATIOX
The presence of these destroyers In
Eastern Maine waters recalled rumors
that have persisted for months that
Teutonic sympathizers had a hidden
wireless station somewhere in the vi
cinity of Bar Harbor, and that there
was a suspicion also that they were
establishing a secret submarine base on
the Maine coast. Few places on the
Atlantic shore line of the United States,
shipping men say, offer better ad
vantages for submarines having de
signs on allied supply ships, Sub
mersibles operating from one of the
innumerable isolated covers on the
Maine coast, it is pointed out. could
threaten both the steamship lane to
Europe and the transport ships passing
out from the ports of the neighboring
Canadian provinces.
The departure of a tug from New
London, where there have been reports
of preparations made for receiving a
German submarine freighter, gave rise
to much speculation as to whether the
undersea boat sighted by the Bovic
was a merchant submarine instead of
another raider. The tug. however, put
in at Vineyard Haven, and it was said
there, that she was going c t to the
Dutch steamer Blnomersdljk. which
was torpedoed on Sunday, to see what
the chances were for salvage work.
The tug, with a diver aboard, was held
In port to-night by a gale.

?WASHINGTON, October 13.?Destroy
ers from tho Atlantic Fleet arc mak
ing a search of tjie Atlantic coast from
Newport north to the Canadian line
to investigate reports of hidden sub
marine bases or wireless stations. Ad
miral Mayo, commander of the Heel,
reported to the Navy Department to
day that he had ordered the search,
hut did not disclose either the source
of the report on which he acted or the
places where illegal radio plants or
bases were said to have been dis
covered.
Secretary Daniels made it plain ior

own initiative in sending out the scout

when tlfe European war began general
orders were issued to the fleet com
