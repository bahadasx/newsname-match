THINK PERSHING
KIBBEY TELLS ITER USERS
I T 1
Before an audience that filled every .
chair in the big courtroom at Florence, j
Judge Kibbey, the other night, ad
dressed Pinal county voters in behalf
of his candidacy for the United States
senate. His original research work on
the problems of irrigation were con
ducted in Florence more than 2S years
ago, his decisions on the bench and his
writings as counsel for water users
have fixed the practice of irrigation
law for the entire west, and naturally
a community of water users was in
tensely interested in what he had
to say.
Last week here in Phoenix Judge
Kibbey opened a new line of cam
paigning when he addressed an im
mense crowd on the Y'. M. C. A. Stad
ium and told it about some of the
things the water users need, and which
they cannot get without legislation.
The charge is made that pledges of aid
for the water users in carrying the
burdens of opening up new country
and making it fruitful, have not been
kept by democratic senators from Ari
zona. In the near future the reclama
tion projects of Arizona and the pri
vately controlled ohes will be in a new
phase of their careers, and will feel a
keen need of a practiced mind in the
senate. The question is frequently
asked. "W7hat is to be done for the
farmers?"
Judge Kibbey has an appeal to make
to every citizen of Arizona. His rec
ord shows that he is capable of han
dling problems affecting every class of
Industrial and agricultural workers in
the state, so his appeal is directed at
no class exclusively.
Judge Kibbey told Florence some
strong reasons why he is entitled to
their votes in the coming election, not
as a reward for past services, but that
he may o many more things for the
people of this state. -
He promised that he would spend
his time at Washington in the com
mittee rooms where the real work is
accomplished. He will not attempt to
surpass the oratorical record of his
opponent. He frankly says he is no
orator. He has been too busy during
his long career to devote any tirfle to
the study and practice of oratory. He
has always been a worker.
That he completely captured Flor
ence was manifest by the enthusiastic
manner in which he was greeted by
nearly all of his listeners after the
meeting. Hundreds of them pledged
their support to the man who will work
for them rather than talk for himself

viewed them in the United States
when the war shall end, and assailed
the democratic tariff policy as a
policy which "means idle plants and
impoverished workmen."
At Springfield and again here to-
night Mr. Hughes assailed the ad-
ministration for the enaction of the
Adamson law. "What are real laws'.'"
he asked. "Real laws are passed aft
er injury with some understanding of
the justice of the case, with some
idea of what is involved and ought
to be done. Shall laws be passed
under duress. I am opposed in the
interest of labor to government by
holdup and I am for government by
reason and fairness.
"No thoughtful American can view
our present economic condition with
out serious apprehension. We are
under the unhealthy stimulus of the
European war. Holies - are raised
which cannot be fulfilled. Our pres

trade is not determined by conditions
of normal competition, but of an
abnormal European want.
"Munitions of war are but a frac

"What will be our condition when
the wa,r is over?" In the first place
a large amount of labor employed at
high wages will lose that employ

supplying will cease. The mere stop

will mean in itself a serious change
in the opportunities of labor. When
the millions of men in the trenches
return to production, our exports of
manifold products will fall off tre

"Think of the percentage of Ameri

"I do not desire to exaggerate.
