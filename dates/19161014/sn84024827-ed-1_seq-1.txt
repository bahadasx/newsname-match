JOPLIN, Mo.. Oct. 13-Charles E. j
Hughes today took his campaign to
Missouri, the fourth of the state that
pkirt the so-called "solid south" to be
visited on his present trip. Save for
one stop, at Springfield, Mo., the en
tire day was spent traveling. The nom
inee reached Joplin tonight and ad
dressed an audience, making his chief
theme the protective tariff.
Abnlrmal Prosperity
Mr. Hughes told the crowd that the
present prosperity of the country was
bum on sands and tnat tne intoxicat-
ed fancy may indulge happy dreams ;
but the sober thought of the country !
is directed to the day when the stimu
lant the European war would be no
longer available. He referred to htose
who are seeking to make political cap
ital out of our present war prosperity,
portrayed in detail conditions as he
.viewed hem in the United States'
when the war shall end. and assailed
the Democratic taritf policy as a poli
cy which "means idle plants and im
poverished workmen."
Coercion vs Reason
Afr SnrinfilH nnrf aeain here trv.
night, Mr. Hughes assailed the admin-
istration for the enactment , of the
Adan'.son law.
"What are real laws?" he asked.
.e iaCu ...qu:.,

tice of the case, with some idea of
what is involved, of what ought to be I
done. I am opposed in the interest of ;

ness. Fools Paradise, This
"No thoughtful American can view
our present economic condition with
out serious apprehension. We are un
der the unhealthy stimulation of the
European war. Hopes are raised that
cannot be fulfilled. Our present pros
perity is built on sand. Our trade is
not determined by conditions of nor
ir.al condition but of the abnormal
European war.
The Hungry Market
"Everything we produce, foodstuffs,
metals, manufactured articles of every
sort, Europe puts forth her hand for.
to fill the void crested by her extremi
ty. The resulting employment of lab- j
or on an unprecedented scale and in- i
creased purchasing power stimulates
trade throughout the country. The in-:

the manufacture of munitions will
make in itself a serious condition in
thfc ranks of labor. When the mil
lions of m-n in the trenches return to
production, our exports of manifold
products will fall off tremendously
even as they have risen tremendously.
"Think of the percentage of the
American labor now profitably em
ployed in making Europe's necessities
created by the exigencies of war.
What will occur when these necessi-
ties no longer exist? The labor now j
devoted to taut abnormal demand
