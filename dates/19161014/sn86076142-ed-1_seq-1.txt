liability law, which has passed the

being vigorously opposed by local
business interests and foreign cor

public. The latter feel that In event
of the act becoming law it will be

of holding up the outside corpora

cation of the law to themselves and
partly on their general desire to have
nothing done to discourage the In

sickness incurred while at work. This

the laborers lay off a great deal and
lie around their quarters In a condi

sort of sickness which Is the result
of hookworm and lack of proper
nourishment. About 70 per cent of
