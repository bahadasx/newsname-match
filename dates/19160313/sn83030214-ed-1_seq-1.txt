TEXT OF CARRANZA MANIFESTO
TO MEXICAN PEOPLE.
Mexico City. Man h 'j.?The text of Gen?*;;?; Carransas mani?
festo follows
"R*. a'jse of the assault which Francisco Villa and the '?.audits
who accompanied bin' trade on the town of Columbus, in Amer?
ican territory, banting houses and killing some of the inhabitants,
soldiers a-, well as civilians, the international situation in these mo
ment-, is re?**- delicate, as the North American pies?, have excited
then people against Mexico, and the government of that country
has discussed the situation in the American Congress, memhcis of
'???hull havf advised intervention.
'The Constitutional Government, which 1 have the honor 10
rep-c,erit. i? also occupied diligently in an effort to solve this deli
iate situation, trying at all costs to maintain the d'ei"?. end ?ov
eretgnty of Mexico, and we yet hope that this lamentable m.idetit
may he detorously arranged, and th-?? there will be no reason fo? an
international conflict
"T have addressed the government of the United S'.ates through
the Foreign Office, stating that the invasion of Villa has historical
precedents, as, in the jretrs ''8<80 and 1886. two parues ol India,?-. ? oil?
ing from the United States invaded Sonora and Chihuahua, commit
ting crimes and depredations on the lives and properties of Mexicans.
"It was then agreed between the governments of the two coun?
tries to permit the respective pas-.-age of armed forces, resulting in
the extermination of the Indians. I have asked the American Gov?
ernment to pursue a like ?ourse in order to solve futurr difficulties.
should they arise, noting th?t Villa and his companions are a group
of bandits, whose act-, the Mexican Government or people would
not he responsible for, and that his i eproachable conduct is due. to
instigations of the reactionary element that, lacking patriotism and
convinced of its defeat, is trying bv all mean1 to bring on armed
intervention
"I have not yet received the answer of the American Gov?
ernment, and. from the reports of my chiefs along the frontier. I
learn that the American forces are mobilizing to pursue and capture
and deliver Villa to the Mexican authorities That the expedition
is in the nature of a punitive campaign and that the sovereignty of
Mexico will be respected.
"The Constitutional Government has given instructions to its
confidential agent at Washington immediately to make representa?
tions that, under no circumstances, will any motive, be the reasons
or explanations of the United States what they may. justity the
armed invasion o? Mexican territory without reciproca'.! rights bein^
granted to the Mexicans, and that not for an instant will the invasion
of Mexican territory or an outrage to its dignity be tolerated.
"I am sure that in this I interpret the national sentiment and
that the Mexican people will worthily comply with their duty, be the
sacrifices what they may, to sustain their rights and sovereignty. If,
?infortunately. we are dragged into a war, which the United States
never can justify, we will not be responsible for the disastrous con?
sequences, but will serve as instruments for Mexican traitors within
and without our country, who have labored long to produce this re?
sult, and upon their heads will fall the inexorable justice of the
Mexican people."
