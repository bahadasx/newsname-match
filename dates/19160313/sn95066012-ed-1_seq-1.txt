SOMERSET MAN ROBBED
Wpodchopper Loses Watch, Money
and Clothes in Holyoke.
The Holyoke, Mass., correspondence
in the Springfield Sunday Republican
contained the following about a Somerset-man's
experience:
"Joseph Pelkey of Somerset, Vt.,
will cut Holyoke off his visiting list in
future unless he receives better treat
ment. Ho is employed as a wood
chopper and came down from Vermont
Friday with $40 in his pocket and an
extra suit of clothes done up in a
bundle, inteuding to see a little of city
life. Ho saw a little. Friday he lost
'20 and a gold watch; yesterday he
lost the suit of clothes. Events were
succeeding each other so rapidly that
he went to the police station to sec
if tho brakes could not be put on.
Within a short time Inspector Man
ning brought in Hormisdas La Foun
taine, who returned about two months
ago from Concord reformatory. When
captured, La Fountaine was wearing
the" visitor's hal. Ho had disposed of
the;:!lothes at a second-hand store
for','i5 cents, according to the police.
Upto last evening the $20 and the
gold watch were still missing, but the
polite have hopes of their recovery.
Pelftey wilf go back to Somerset with
a wrong idea of the motto, 'Do it for
loIyokc."

GIBSON WAS NOT CLUBBED
Sharon Man Died of Hemorrhages and
,iw Shock of Gunshot Wound.
Woodstock. March 11. Charles
Lelghton and sons, Walter and Newell
Leighton, charged with killing A. L.
Gibson on February 24 In Sharon, dur
ing a dispute over the ownership of
logs and- the location of a boundary
line of a timber lot, were arraigned
yesterday .in Hartford municipal court
before Judge A. G. Whitman. The
three men entered pleas of not guilty.
State's Attorney H. E. Cole of Wind
sor appeared for the state and Ray
mond Trainor of White River Junction
represented the Leightons. The hear
ing will not' be finished until some
time today. .
The state ' introduced three wit
nesses, one of whom was" Dr. E. J.
Stoa of -Sharon, who testified to ex
amining Gibson's body. The physl
ciail's testimony was to the effect that
he found o. evidences that Gibson had
b erPbrutally clubbed, as was alleged
at tbo.tijne of the tragedy. Dr. Stone
testified that the man's death was
doubtless caused by hemorrhages and
shock incident to a gtmshot ' 'wound.

North Adams Regrets Loss of Buii
v v . nets In Liquids. : . ,
'Three devotees of Bacchus went to
the town meeting at: Somerset Tuesi
day and carried that town for license
inasmuch as only four votes were cast
on this question, and only one of them
was for no-license. By the same vote
the Perry Prohibition act and the di
rect primary act were turned down.
Thus "by an overwhelming plurali
ty," the town of Somerset passes Into
the license column and the uturdy
woodchoppers of that place may se
cure their fire water at home instead
of coming down to North, Adams for
it, unless, of course, no one shall apply
for the one license that will be allow
ed there. This city, as a result, will
probably lese come of its picturesque
visitors, who came down at intervals
from the Vermont town to see the
sights, the last of which is generally
the police 'Court, where it was com
mon to hear them tell of a roll of $50
or $100 having disappeared in a day or
two among .local thirst quenching em
poriums. North : Adams Transcript.

Upon Heads of Traitorous

Mexico City, March 12. General
Carranza tonight issued a manifesto
to the nation declaring that under no
circumstances -would the Mexican gov
ernment grant the right to the United
States to violate Mexican territory by
sending in au armed force in pursuit
of Villa without consent and the re
ciprocal privilego being first obtained
and admitted. Word was sent to the
confidential agent of the Mexican gov.
ernmcut in Washington to make im
mediate representations to this effect
General Carranza says In his mani
festo: i ;
"I am sure that I interpret in this
matter the national Kcntiment and that
the Mexican people will comply in a
dignified manner with their duty, bo
the sacrifices wbat they may, to sus
tain their right3 and sovereignty if,
unfortunately, this drags us into a war
a war which the United States can
never justify. We will not ' be re
sponsible for, the. disastrous conse
quences. Upon the ' heads 1 of - the
traitorous Mexicans who within and
without this couutry have labored to
produce this result, will fall the inex
orable justice of the peopla:" ' f
Douglas, Ariz., March 13. Eleven

both sides of the border, however,
American and Carranza armies mad?
noticeable progress toward concentrat
ing their forces for the hunt for
Francisco Villa in northern Chihua
hua. Tho plight of 500 Mormons, col

ports multiplied here today that Fran
cisco Villa was disintegratiirg his
force of from 1,500 to 2.500 men
American military authorities ' said' it
might have been better to i go afto'
Villa Thursday, when his raiders fled
southward. The raiders then' were
demoralized and wero droppins . loot
and war material under tho attack of
fifty-nine men commanded by Major
Frank Tompkins. . -. v
Requests of Colonel Herbert Slocum
commanding the Thirteenth Cavalry
here, and Major Tompkins to be al
lowed to renew the pursuit" Friday
with a larger force were denied pend
ing the organization of the large puni
tive expedition. Today it was stated
that thi3 expedition, owing to . in
adequate railroad facilities and the
widely scattered position of the troops
necessary to constitute it, who have
been on patrol duty, might require sev
eral days' preparation before it could
enter Mexico, at least from tills point
Meanwhile reports from Mexican
sources stated that Villa apparentlv
was carrying out a plan to elude pur
suit by breaking up his forces, into
small bands and hiding among ' tht
mountains. Some of his forces were
reported approaching the Sonora State
border. Others were said to be mak
ing their way southward and southeast
ward toward the mountains of the San
Geronimo district, from which the
bandit chieftain started March 1 with
the announced intention of invading
the United States, . -

THE SAGE OF WHITINGrtAM
Former, Senator From Bennington
County Writes on Public Issues
Editor of Brattleboro Reformer:
Well, the battle of the ballots has
been louglit! 1 am much pleased with
the result as I believe it is right. I do
not believe in having laws on our stat
ue books that public opinion will not
enforce. I very well remember when
1 was a boy and lived In Franklin coun
ty, Mass.. going to North Adams with
my father. We went to the old Rich
mond House for dinner and there was
a man in the office with a blue uniform.
I asked my father what office he held
and he told me he was one of the
state constables whose duty it was to
enforce the prohibitory law. Then I
asked father where all the men were
going who passed through the office
and went out of it by a rear door and
he replied, "To the bar."
On our way home I asked my father
why the state constable sat there In
the office and allowed tho men to go
to the bar and he replied. 'Tyler,
public opinion will not uphold the of
ficer in enforcing the law." , I have al
ways remembered what he said about
that and when I became a man' and
lived, under prohibition In Vermont I
thought he was right. I know . tho
argument that our friends on the oth
er side make about tho crime and mis
ery that the sale of liquor causes is
true in great measure, but I do not
believe they will ever be able to stop
that until they stop its manufacture.
Ol' course, I believe we can educate
the young that it is a great deal better
not to use it.
In regard to the direct primary I do
not have so decided an opinion on how
that will work, but 1 thought two
years ago the people of Vermont de
manded a direct primary and voted for
it then, as I also did last Tuesday, but
I felt a good deal as our good Demo
cratic frit-nd, John E. Gale, felt about
a "pineles8 legislature." I will say
now that if a certain two members of
that house should attempt to become
Windham county senators ,this year
and the Democrats should . nominate
J oh it, 13. Galo to oppose I. should not
only vote -for John but should try to
get some. of my friends to, do the same.
"'' ' ' Sincerely,
T." D. Goodell.

that Its feet, owing to some peculiar

A Fight in Vermont
Some of the younger republicans in
Vermont are up iu arms. They claim
to have discovered that a group of old
er and more conservative republicans
met recently in a large city outside of
the state and fixed "a slate" for dele
gates to the republican national con
vention In Chicago, which they hope to
put through at the coming State con
vention to elect delegates to the qa
tional convention. provided for in con
nectlcn with a direct vote for choice ot
President, if the voters so desire.
The young republicans say they will'
not stand for this, and they propose ta '
make a fight to give. the younger and
more progressive element of the party
representation in the national councils
If Hughes and Roosevelt, and so. "on,
refute to assent, the young men can
not readily vote for a liberal candidate
in Vermont's presidential primary, but
they will fight to select delegates to
the State convention,' standing for a
progressive republican upon whom re
publicans and progressives can unite,

A Deserved Tribute.
When a good friend and neighbor, a
devoted mother, a member of tho
community whose influence was on
tho side of the best interests of Ufa
leaves tho place which her presence
lias made a truo home, ono feels that
the ordinary formal notice does not
satisfy one's sense of justice to such
a life and character. ;
It is only when one like Mrs. John
II. Warren passes from earth that one
can truly appreciate her roal worth,
her ability as a home niaker,her loy
alty to her friends, her thoughtful
kindness to all. ', ;
"Her children riso up and call her
blessed" Well have they proved .' the
length, breadth aud depth of her un
selfish affection. - "' ' - - . m
Her life was a quiet one of useful
ness and goodness: and hor memory
will linger long as a benediction. . t. '
