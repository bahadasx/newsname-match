CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS
LOOK FOR RAPID PROGRESS
With International Questions Appar
ently Out of the Way.
Washington, March 12. Ordering of
American troops into Mexico to pur
sue General Villa and the administra
tion's victory in the armed ship con
troversy have had a steadying effect
upon congress, which for several
weeks had been a storm center over
international affairs. The vain effort
to give official warning to Americans
against travel an armed merchantmen
of belligerents had turned the con
gress from its regular course of bust'
ness and there were fears of another
outbreak to hinder the progress of leg
islation further when Villa and his
raiders committed the murderous as
saults at Columbus, X. M. But the
prompt action of the administration
has served as an effective check thus
far upon congressional agitation with
regard to Mexico and no legislation on
this subject is now contemplated, un
less there should arise entangling alli
ances with the de facto government in
Mexico.
With these Issues apparently out of
the way, congressional leaders hope to
make rapid progress with Important
business at hand, particularly the ap
propriation bill and the national de
fense programme. Within ten days at
least the house expects to have the
army reorganization bill before it. Thi
senate already Is at work on the gov
ernment armor plate plant bill and
will deal with the senate army reor
ganization bill before many more
days.
That the military activity In Mexico
will serve to hasten the completion of
the defense plans of the administration
Is admitted, even by the staunchest
pacificists in congress, nor does anyone
deny that It will win votes for pre
paredness.

PLANS FOR CAMPAIGN AGAINST VILLA
Situation on Border Has Prevented the Rapid Con
centration
GREAT EXCITEMENT IN
General Funston Says Expeditionary Force Will Not Start
Until Commissary Arrangements Are Completed
Looks for a Long and Arduous Campaign Declares It
Will be No Swivel Chair Affair Unlike Ordinary War
fare in That There Can be No Surrender as Villa Men
Would Kill All Americans Civilian Scouts Acquainted
With the Country Have Been Hired Valuable Scouting
Duty is Expected From the Aero Squadron.
Ran Antonio, Texas. March 12. It
became known today that the plans
for the campaign against Francisco
i la have been affected bv the -border
situation elsewhere than at Colum
bu. X. M. The situation. It is said.
Is so important as to have hindered
rapid concentration of the punitive
expedition that will go after the per
petrator of the Columbus outrage.
Great excitement has been noted, it
is authoritatively stated, in the Car
ranza garrisons at Nogales. opposite
the Arizona border town of that name
at Picdras Negrae. which fronts Eagle
Pass. Texas, from across the Rio
Grande.
To Await Arrival of Troops.
"We do not ourselves know tmt
when the expedition that wil search
for Villa will start into Mexico. It
will go forward Just as soon as a
sufficient force with an adequate
commissary can be organized. It will
now be held back, however, until the
troops now ordered to the tmrder hv
arrived.
i nis was tne statement today of
-Major General Frederick Funston
wnile he was outlining at Fort Sam
Musion. southern department head
quarters, as closelv as mi;itr- vn-
dler.cy would permit plans that will be
airecrea against the Mexican leader.
He added: "There Is no use going
at this thing half-cocked. The task
aneaa or u8 win be long and ar
durous."
Uneasiness Along.. the Border.
The uneasiness along the border has
extenaea to tne large (Mexican popu
lation on the American side. Troops
now stationed In the -border towns are
sufficient to cope -with any situation
that mav arise. General Funstnn
However, as It Is his Intention to use
these troops in the search tor Villa
ana as thev cannot be moved until
other detachments arrive to succeed
inem on the border patrol, complete
organization of the expeditionary
force has been delayed.
Fear of Residents in Border Towns.
Army circles feel bound to respect
the fear of residents In American bor
der towns that, notwithstanding as
surances from Genera Carranza's
representatives, uprisln-s may rollow
the actual occupation of Mexican ter
ritory by American soldier-. It Is
felt that tho welfare of the vorder
cannot be sacrificed to the doubtful
success of a hasty and therefore un
prefared pursuit of the fugitive Vil
la General Funston's statement toda
re garding the uncertainty of the puni
tive expedition's departure 'from
American soil and his partial outline
of the projected plan of campaign
were In replv to what he termed the
Impatience of the American people for
speedy action.
People Must Be Patient.
"The people must be patient." tie
said. "We must tve adequately pre
pared for this thing.
"In the first place, we must use. as
much as possible, soldiers who are ac
customed to Mexican border duty.
However, these men cannot be remov
ed from their present posts until they
are relieved by troops drawn rrom
other departments and hurried to the
border.
T-arrporiation No Easy Matter.
"Transportation of the relief patrols
is not an easy matter. Many of the-e
troops consist of scattered depart
ments that have to be concentrated,
sometimes by means of difficult
marches, before they can be sent
southward.
Concentration and transportation of
troops 1- not all of our problem, how
ever. We are going to march Into a
country that will afford us little or
no forage. The commissary must be
adequately supplied.
Soldiers Must Be Well Fed.
"A Villa follower can live on little
or nothing. An American soldier
must be well fed If he is to give good
service.
"We won't gain anything bv haste.
To send an adequate force." insuf
ficiently prepared, after Villa would
hinder and not hasten matters."
Speaking regarding the course the
campaign will take. General Funston
said:
More Than Ona Expeditionary Force.
"There will be more than one ex
peditionary force, although I am not
at liberty to say how many or from
what points they will start. They
may make simultaneous entries. Into
Mexico or thev may be sent forward
at Intervals. They may all leave tha
same point or they may depart from
different points.
No Swivel Chair Campaign.
"All this wlH be left to the discre
tion of the expeditionary commander
who will have complete charge of all
the forces In the field. I don't believe
in swivel cnair campaigning.
"Necessarily, the campaign will de
velop new situations and the dlsnoa.il
of the troops Is contingent upon these
aeveiopments. i may at Intervals vis
It the field forces.-
"Of course the expedition win not
await tne arrival at the border of
ail tne troops now being dispatched
from other departmental station it
will be gotten under way lust as soon
as possible and aa other troops arrive
tney win do sent forward as rein-
rorcemcnts.

The general explained that the first
aero squadron and the regular scouts
of the army would not do all of the
scouting of the expedition.
Hiring Civilian 8eouts.
"We are hiring civilian scouts" ki
said, "who are familiar with every
foot of the territory we will pene
trate Americans who have been
working down In that country for
years."
Aero Squadron of Great Servtoe.
It Is the general's exbectatlon thut
the aero squadron will be of great
servlee.
"Of course the flyers have seen duty
down on the border." be said. "They
could not accomplish much, however,
for thickets and stretches of bushes
made observations difficult. Out In
the open mesas of the territory we)
will ti averse, however, the boys will
rt r der great assistance."
Advance duty service In the small
detachments that are thrown out by
arm'.es as "feelers" will b the most
hazardous work the American soldiers
will encounter. General Funston be-1
lleves.
Means Fight to the Death. -"Villa
troops will at times surprise,
these scouting parties.' be said -In'
ordinary warfare our men migbt. If
hopelessly outnumbered, and re-'
simance waa futile, surrender wit a
safety. To surrender to Villa, how
ever, would be worse than suicidal
Villa's men would kilt every American
they can lay hands on. Every en-'
counter with them means fight to tm
death for our men."
