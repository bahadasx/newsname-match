unable to control his soldier*.
With a rebellion on his hands. Carratiza. according to this
official, would cease to regard the move as a "friendly in

quer Mexico instead of merely capturing Villa.
The Carranzistas manifest no inclination to co-operate
with the Americans in running down the "scourge of the
border." If thev do work with the Americans, it is con
sidered fewer regulars will be needed and Villa would more
quickly be exterminated. However, United Slates army men

Secy. Lansing Reaches
Agreement With Car
ranza on Ultimatum
Against Invasion.
WASHINGTON, March 13.—Secretary Lansing an
nounced this afternoon the state department had reached an
agreement with <icn. Carranra with regard to American troops
entering Mexico and with regard to the "military reciproci;y''
proposition made by ( arranza.
It is believed the agreement is a modification in some
point* of Carranza* proposals in his proclamation issued
yesterday
Carran/a's manifesto, made public yesterday in Mexico,
'in which he breathed defiance against the proposed American
'invasion unless Carranzistas were permitted by President
Wilson to cross into the I'nited States in pursuit of bandits,
is regarded here as designed to meet Mexican j>opular oppo
sition to "invasion." or to "intervention." and to give Car
ranza legal and moral grounds for consenting to the Ameri
can move.
As a first move in its "little war" on Villa, the admin
istration placed an air-tight embargo on all shipments of arms
and munitions to Mexico.
F.ven mine explosives are barred. Individuals attempt
ing to cross the line with weapons will he halted by Ameri
can sentries. A million rounds of Carranza ammunition is
held tip at Douglas. Ariz. It is believed Carranza will regis

Troops Travel Under Sealed Orders
Dispatches from the border today say American concen
tration against < ien. Villa is in full swing this afternoon.
The Sixth infantry marched out of Fort Bliss and headed
westward enroute to "somewhere on the border." Other
bodies of troops are moving.
Railroad employes have been told they would be expelled
from service if they gave out information about military
operations. vp
The Sixth i« traveling under sealed order*. From va
rious unofficial sources was learned its destination is be
lieved to be Columbus.
The I'itli infantry is to follow. It is believed the loth
will go to Columbus, where upwards of 5,000 men are to he
concentrated hv the time the order to march is received.
Many Carranzistas to Oppose U. S.
Indications are that. In spite of the agreement of the
provisional president, a considerable number of Carranzistas
will ultimately oppose the entry of an American army into
M exico.
The constitutionalist generals are awaiting instructions
from Carranza. Meantime the Carranzistas arc apparently
concentrating along the border.
It is estimated there are more than 10.000 of them in
Northern Mexico, and an unusually large number scattered
along the boundary.
