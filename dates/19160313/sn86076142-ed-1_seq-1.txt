RESTORED TO HEALTH
The civil case of J. K. Murphy of
the Wholesale Produce company, En
nis Brown and company of Sacramen

was called in the district court this
morning. The case is a peculiarly
Interesting one to Tonopah, inasmuch
as the first women were called to
Jury duty.
The young ladies were in court
promptly and no blunders were made
by the fair sex, much to the disgust of
the hypercritical men. The counsel
were particularly kind and thoughtful
Miss Mabel Donaldson's name was the
first called to answer -here." Miss
Donaldson, however, escaped duty,
Judge Averill asked all present to
be careful about talking in the court
room. The men were doing all the
talking and the chewing. The ladies
needless to say, were perfectly de
corous.
Miss Bessie Shields was the first
woman called in Tonopah to go into
the jury box. She arose from her
seat gracefully, walked across the
floor leisurely with a most becoming
smile upon her face. Miss Shields,
however, was not passed to aerve on
the Jury. While Miss Shields was be
ing examined she was told by an at
torney, "Be careful don't tell all you
know." That attorney evidently knew
a woman's failing. Miss Urquhart waa
excused from duty.
Mrs. Caroline Lawrence, an employe
of Hunt's dry goods store, was called
and accepted. Mrs. Lawrence Is the
only woman on the Jury. 1
Miss Emma Heen was called and
examined, but afterward excused.
