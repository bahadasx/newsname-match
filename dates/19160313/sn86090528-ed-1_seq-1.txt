PURCHASE
BY CITY IS
PROPOSED
Aldermen Will Inspect Tract of Thirty Acres
Near Pumping Station; Needed by
Water System; Possible
Park Site
Members of the city council will
probably visit during the next few
(lays the property adjoining the city
water works plant for inspection with
the objvct of purchase.
This is the property discussion re
garding the purchase of which was
taken up by 'be council at the regular
session of that body, It is said to
belong to a child of John Sharp and
contains, it Is stated, thirty acres less
lie ucreajre token up by the Rock Is
land right of way.
At the request, of Mayor Coffman,
Councilman Ouboise, at !h-s recent
meeting, introduced a resolution au
thorizing the council to purchase this
property at a price of not to exceed
SC.nOO. Definite action in the matter
vas postponed until such time as the
members of the city council, in p.
body, might visit ar.d inspect the pro
perty. It was stated at the time the coun
cil had the mutter'. primarily under
consideration, that the purchase of
this property by the city might be the
means et forestalling possible future
expenses which might become neces
sary through having to take up and
remove the intake pipe of the city wa
ter plant, said intake reaching "the
river after passing through and
across this property.
When seen in the matter this morn
ing Mayor Coffman stated that the
miitter of tho purchase of ,he thirty
acres in question would be in the
hands of the city council.
Mayor Coffman said further that
this property would, in his opinion,
make the city an ideal park; that
many acres of the same were covered
with stately trees and that the fract
of land was within easy reach of the
city, not being over two miles from
the cily hall.
When asked if the land was subject
to overflow, the mayor stated that it
had been known for the greater por
tion of the property to become inun
dated when tho river was at flood
stage. This inundation was from back
water and the land had only 'been I
under water twice within seevral
years.
In addition to the fine trees and the
natural sward, thenayor stated that
a large natural lake may now b
found upon he tract of land, well
st.:ck1 with fish. This take could,
Mr. Coffman said, be made much larg
er ar.d with a minimum of work and
expense.
Member of the council seem to en
tertain divergent views in this mat
ter. One or two members favor, it
would yeem, the purchase of the pro
perty, at less than $2,000, and seem ti
be of the opinion that if would prove
a good investment and that a neat
park could be made of it for a lltue
money.
Other members of the council think
the. purchase of thU properety would jl
he ill advised. These claim that the
property lies teo far out of the city
for park purposes and also claim that
the fact that it overflows even occa-,
i-ionall' makes it uut'it for park pur-,

BIG GROWTH
IN RUBBER
INDUSTRY
Census Bureau Report Shows Increase of
Over Fifty Percent in Volume of
Manufactured Products Dur
ing Year L914
By United Press.
WASHINGTON, 1). C, March 13.
A preliminary statement of the general
results of the 1914 census of manufac
tures with reference to the rubber in
dustry has been issued by Director S.
U Rogers of tlie .bureau of census
department of commerce. It consists of
a detailed statement of the quantities
and the values of the various products
manufactured, prepared under tha di
rection of William M. Stuart, chief
statistician for manufacturers.
Reports were received from 331 es
tablishments. The principal products
of 23 of these establishments were rub
ber boots and shoes; of IS, rubber belt
ing, hose, packing, etc.; and of 290
automobile tires or casings and inner
tubes, motorcycle and bicycle tires,
rubber clothing, druggists' and station
ers' sundries and other miscellaneous
rubber gooes. The products reported
for ihe 3'J1 establishments for 1911
were valued at $300,231,827. At the
census 1000, 2fi7 establishments were
reported, with products valued at $197,
3.04,038. The increase in value of pro
ducts, therefore, was $102,857,189, or
52.1 per cent.
In addition, rubber products to the
value of S-I4G,GSS were reported in 1914
by 14 establishments engaged primar
iiy, but which produced rubber goods
as subsidiary products.
The production of rubber tires for
1!)14 was valued at f 1.46,411,692 and
formed almost half, 4S.4 per cent of
the total value of all kinds of rubber
poods manufactured during the year.
Statistics for the manufacture of tires
were not obtained for 1909, but it mayf
be safely assumed that the increase of
,"2.1 per cent in the total annanl cut
put of rubber goods during the 5-year
period is accounted for in very lar.?e
part by the enormous growth of this
branch of the industry. There was
reported the manufacture of 8,020,813
automobils tires or casings, valued at
$j03,7l,223; of 7,906,993 automobile In
r.er tubes, valued at $20,098,936; of
solid tires for motor and other vehicles,
i.o the value of $13,735,681; and of 3,
728.13S motorcycle, bicycle and aero
plane tires, valued at $6,903,852.
Next to tires, rubber footwear was
the most important product reported
for the industry. There were manu
factured during the year 4,024,486 pairs
of boots, valued at $12,647,934. and
7,211,728 pairs of shoes valued at
$37,838,222. The value of rubber cloth
ing produced was $6,396,810: of gar
cen, fire and other hose, $16,8.5:1,693;
of rubber belting, $7,989,40.5; of rub

U. S. Department of Agriculture Cautions
Farmers Against Planting Short
Staple YarletV., Urging Care
in Selection of Seed
DANGER OF LOWERING
AMERICAN STANDARD
Inferior Grade Would Force Planters to
Compete with India; Important to
Maintain Reputation of Lo
cality in Markets
WASHINGTON, D. C, March 13.
The department of agriculture on April
S. 1914, and again on March 2, 1913,
issued warnings to farmers of the
southwest against planting varieties
of cotton that usually produced a sta
ple of less than seven-eights Inch In
length, especially sucn varieties as are
t aid produce halt seed and half lint. In
view of the approaching planting sea
son, the department wishes to reitur
ate these warnings for the benefit! ot
the entire cotton belt. The producers
of cotton, for their own welfare, should
been his advice, and should exercise
Judicious care in the selection Of plant
ing seed.
The following reasons are given for
warding cotton growers against plaa
ing any variety that usually produces
a staple of less than seven-eighths
inch in length: ' .
1 Cotton of less than seven-eighths
inch staple is of approximately the
fame spinning value as tha bulk of
the cotton of India. On economic prin
ciples, the American product should
be maintained on a higher level of in
trinsic worth than that of India In
order that the American crop may not
be forced tc compete in the market
of the world with the cotton of India.
2. Cotton of less than seven-eighths
inch staple is inferior to the American
quality, and localities that produce
such cotton in appreciable quantities
soon establish reputations for an in
ferior product. The price of all cot
ton in such markets will suffer oa
account of the poor reputation of the
market.
3. Competent cotton buyers discrim
inate against extremely short Btaple
whenever such cotton is discovered.
They should he equally careful to dis
criminate in Tavor of cotton of good
staple. The farmer who produces in
ferior cotton la likely to find that hit
product brings a price materially lower
than quotations would indicate, as Its
true value. The seller commonly looks
upon such discrimination as a penalty,.
while the buyer considers that he Is
paying the full value for an inferior
commodity.
4. Under the common practice of
the cottcn trade, the price of spot cot
ton is governed largely by future quo
tations. In order that future quota
tions might more accurately reflect
the value of spot cotton, congress Ir.
thq United States cotton futures act,
provided a form of contract, exempt
from tho tax Imposed by the act, on
which cotton of exremely low grade
or which Is less than seven-eighths
inche in length of staple Is not de
llverable. This action of congress was
intended primarily for the benefit of
producers. One of its results was the
adoption by the New York and fter
Orleans exchanges of the exempted
form o future contract, so that cot
ton of less than seven-eighths inch
in length of staple cannot be delivered.
This legislation in no way affects any
sale of spot cotton.
5. . As the variety of seed planted
is the primary factor In determining
length of staple, and as there are ear
ly maturing prolific varieties which
produce a staple of at least an inch In
length, no farmer or community is Jus
tified In planting an inferior variety.
or In expecting the full market prica
for a debased article of commerce.
