ZA'S REQUEST.
Indications in Washington Today thai nza's Request May
be Granted Secretary Baker Rek V, His Promise to
Make News Public as Soon as He Rec Official Informa
tion that American Troops Have Cro. .nto Mexico
Army Officials Who Have Studied the Ca anza Manifesto,
Are Convinced that it was Not Intended in the Sense as a
Communication to the United States But that Carranza
Was Forced to Satisfy Conflicting Elements Among His
People From Heavy Troop Movement at Columbus, it
Seems that that Point Will Be Made Base for Operations
Aeainst the Villa Band Villa Said to be Fleeing South
Into the Mountains, Where
Washington, D. C, March 13.
The United States will reply
to Carranza's request for a reci
procal agreement for the cross
ing of troops at the Mexican
border, late today, after a con
ference between secretary Lan
sing and president Wilson.
It is indicated that Carran
za's proposal will be accepted.
Secretary of War Baker to
day reiterated his promises that
he would make the news public
as soon as he received official
'Notification that the American
troops had crossed the border.
The acceptance will probably
be on the ground that Carranza
troops may cross into United
States territory in pursuit of the
bandits at any time that Amer
ican forces are not present in
sufficient numbers.
Army officials, who have
studied the Carranza manifes
to, were convinced that it was
not intended in the sense as a
communication to the United
States, but that Carranza was
forced to satisfy the conflicting
elements among his own adher
ents.
Concentrating at Columbus
Columbus, N. M., March 13. The ac
tual concentration of United States
troops for the expedition into Mexico
was begun today. From the very
heavy troop movement here, it would
seem that this point Is to be made the
base for operations. Villa, with a small
body of men, it -is reported here is
fleeing farther from the border daily
into the mountains where he once
reigned as bandit chief.
Fire at Monterey Presidio.
Monterey, Calif., March 13. Mon
terey Presidio was destroyed by fire
early today, about six hours after be
ing vacated by troops of the first cav
alry who left for the Mexican border.
Firemen attempting to extinguish the

these clubs. Rules were adopted yes
terday, and the schedule adopted.
The local club must select its of

A president, treasurer and manager
of the team must be selected, but
the temporary officers have already
made these selections, if they can in

dule, is only a few days off.
T
AGAINST ILL
COUNTY ATTORNEY SAYS THAT
ANY BUILDING WHERE IT IS
PROVEN LIQUOR IS SOLD, WILL
BE CLOSED.
As an aftermath of the recent term
of district court, the county attorney
has taken another step toward putting
a crimp in the sale of intoxicants in
the Healdton field, and especially that
portion of the field situated in Carter
j county, lie has issued injunction pro
! ceedings against certain buildings in
Ragtown, which he alleges have been
used as places in which intoxicants
are sold, and prays the court that
upon hearing these places be ordered
to close permanently.
The court of inquiry Is still in ses
sion, according to a statement of the
county attorney, and there seems to
be a determination upon the part of
county officials to make it so hard
for boot!cgerg to operate in tie
Healdton field that they will quit bus
ness. Some speculation is rife as to what
the outcome of the cases found guilty
at the recent term will be when taken
to the criminal court of appeals.
There is a diversity of opinion among
the lawyers as to the legality of
evidence secured by the court of in
quiry and it is reported that some of
the lawyers have a surprise to spring
when the cases come up in the ap
pellate court

SENT 10 WASHINGTON
Confidential Agent of Carranza in
Washington Instructed by Principal
Chief to Make Representations to
Officials at Washington.
Mexico City, March l.'i. General
Carranza last night issued a declara
tion t hat under no circumstances
would Mexico grant the right to tli'
L'nited States to send an armd force
to capture Villa without consent and
the reciprocal privilege being iii'.-t
obtained.
Orders were sent to the confident
ial agent of the Mexican government
in Washington to make ininic-Jiate
representations to this effect.
The full text of General Canv.nza's
manifesto follows:
"Because of the assault which
Francisco Villa and the bandits umi
accompanied him made upon the '.own
of Columbus, in American territory
burning houses and killing soiie nf
the inhabitants, soldiers, as veil as
civilians, the international situation
in these moments is very delicate, the
North American press has excited
their people against Mexico and the
government of that country has d!s
cussed the situation in the American
congress, members of which have ad
vised jnterventlon.
"The constitutionalist government,
which I have the honor to represent,
also is occupied diligently in an ef
fort to solve this delicate situation,
trying at all costs to maintain the
dignity and sovereignty of Mexico
with the hope that this lamentable
incident may be decorously arranged
and that there will be no reason for
an international conflict
"I have addressed the government
of the United States through the for
eign office stating that the Invasion
of Villa has historical precedents as
in the years 1880 and 1S8C two par
ties of Indians coming from the Uni
ted States invaded Sonora and Chihua
hua, committing crimes and depreda
tions on the lives and properties of
Mexicans. It was then agreed be
tween the governments of the two
countries to permit the respective
passage of armed forces, resul'ing in
the extermination of the Indians.
"I have asked the American gov
ernment to pursue a like course in
order to solve future difficulties,
should they arise, noting that Villa
and his companions are a group of
bandits, whose acts, the Mexican gov
ernment or people would not be re
sponsible for and that his reproach
able conduct is due to Instigations of
the reactionary element that is trying
by all means to bring on armed in
tervention on the part of the Ameri
can government. I learn that the
American forces are mobilizing to
capture and deliver Villa to Mexi
cans; that the expedition is in the
nature of a punitive expedition and
that the sovereignty of Mexico will
be respected.
"The constitutional government has
given instructions to its confidential
agent at Washington Immediately to
make representations that un ier no
circumstances will any motive, be
the reasons or explanations of the
United States what they may, Justify
armed invasion of Mexican territory
without reciprocal rights being grant
ed to the Mexicans, and not for an
Instant will the invasion of Mexican
territory or an outrage to its dignity
be tolerated.
"I am sure that in this I interpret
the national sentiment and that the
Mexican people will worthily comply
with their duty, be the sacrifices what
they may, to sustain their rights and
sovereignty if, unfortunately, we are
dragged into a war, which the United
States never can justify, we will not
be responsible for the disastrous con
sequences. Upon the heads of the
Mexican traitors who, within and
without our country, have labored
long to produce this result will fall
the Inexorable justice of the Mex
ican people."
GENERAL FUNSTON ANNOUNCES
THAT NO TROOP MOVEMENT IS
PROBABLE TODAY.
STILL II PREPARATION
Notwithstanding Carranza's Notifica
tion to Washington, the American
Troops Are Going Ahead With
Preparations.
San Antonio, Tex., March 13. No
movement of the expeditionary for
ces, searching for Villa, into Mexico
Is probable today, according to Ma
jor General Funston.
The general said, however, that the
preparations for the expedition were
going right ahead, despite Carrnn '.'.i
notification to Washington, tint hy
did not consent to American troop
entering Mexico, unless Carrana
troops were allowed to enter til1:
United States.
It is officially announced i.a Brig
adier General John J. Pershing, com
manding the Kl Paso divi-tioti of the
border patrol, will lead the ,'unitive
expedition.
General Funston said lie had receiv
ed no notification that the expedi
tion would be he!' up pending n un
tiations with Carranz-i
A shortage of rolling stock, Fun
ston said, was hindering the concen
tration, and this was one reason why
troop movement today was unlikely.
Funston said that when the move
ment was completed there would be
only six or eight regiments left in the
United States, other than those on
border patrol.
There is little likelihood of state
militia being called out, unless there
should be a turn in events necessi
tating a more important) expedition
than the punitive expedition planned.
Troops Ready ii Arizona.
El Paso, Tex.. Mtrvh 13.--in spite
of official denials, reports are per
sistent today that American cavalry
on the Arizona border have gathered
for immediate crossing of the Ameri
can border, and that they might
cross at any time today.
General Gavira, commanding at
Juarez, came to Kl Paso this morning
to hold a conference with General
Pershing. Gavira said the meeting
would be held in the American con
sulate here.
The point where the cavalry expe
dition is reported gathering is near
San liernardino, Mexico.

ington, an embargo on war munitions

At the time of the fire, some six
teen loaded cars were at the sheds,

TEXAS COUNTY
FRANKLIN COUNTY TAXPAYERS
ARE PREPARING TO VOTE
BONDS FOR HIGHWAY CON
STRUCTION. Franklin county, Texas, of which
Mount Vernon is the county seat, is
in the midst of a campaign for' better
roads, and is going to hold an election
on March 28, to vote bonds for this
purpose.
Colonel Sidney Suggs has been In
vited by the business men of Mount
Vernon to come and assist them in
expounding the doctrine of good
roads that the bond issue may carry
by an overwhelming majority.
Colonel Suggs has accepted, and
will leave next Sunday for Mount Ver
non to assist in this work.
Iast December, Hopkins county
voted four hundred thousand dollars
worth of road bonds, and Colonel
Suggs was instrumental in putting
that election over. The reputation
of the ex-highway commissioner of
Oklahoma as a good roads booster is
appreciated without the borders of
his home slate, nnd whenever the
taxpayers of any of the Texas coun
ties, where he spent many years of
his life, want to put through a bond
issue for road purposes, his services
are in demand.
ANOTHER
EEK
IS
PETITION WILL BE PRESENTED
TO COUNTY COMMISSIONERS,
ASKING THAT THE ROAD BE
OPENED.
For some time there has been an
agitation going on for a road from
the city, northeast to Caddo creek In
section 3 4s-2e, about halt way to Her
wyn road a short distance east of the
point mentioned.
Tom Itandol who lives in that lo
cality, states that the land owners
along the route have agreed to donate
the right of way and the route has
been surveyed by the county sur
veyor. The route from the city limits would
traverse that section of country about
one and a half miles west of the San
ta Fe t'tcks and would go through a
thickly settled neighborhood who are
now compelled to take a circuitous
route in order to bring their produce
to the local market. Mr. Raodol stat
ed that the matter would be again
placed before the board of county com
missioners and they would be petition
ed to open the road. Caddo creek would
have to be bridged at this point and
he states that the commissioners have
informed him that they have do funds
with which to purchase the bridge.
