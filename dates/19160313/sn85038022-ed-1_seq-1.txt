RELIEVED thi: COXflESTIOX.
Tho oxcurslon over tho L. & N.
,from this city to Frankfort Saturday
was by long odds tho largest week
day crowd that has left this city since
tho Sunday school excursion to Cin
cinnati sovcral years ago. It simply
got Agent Kills' goat, so to speak. Hut
ho was equal to the emergency. He
had ordered two extra cars for this
trnln, but tho crowd could havo filled
five easily, and Saturday morning ho
ordered three moro coaches to bo sent
on tho northbound train, and when It
met tho excursion train these cars
were transferred to It, thus relieving
tho congestion. And then there was
room for ono moro passenger.
Mr. William Mtnton was the guest
Saturday and Sunday of relatives at
Covington.
