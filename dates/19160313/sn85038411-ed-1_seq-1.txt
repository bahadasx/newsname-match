' By Associated l*ress
Washington, March 13. The Mex
ican situation showed no outward
change to-day, with the army stead
ily preparing to carry out President
Wilson's orders to pursue the Villa
bandits.
No movements of troops across the
border were reported to the War De
part men I although they were hourly
expected.
General Carranza's proposal lor a
rt eiproeal arrangement by which,
either his forces or American troops
may pursue bandits on either side of
the line probably will be accepted by
the United Slates.
In practice it will have 110 effect be
cause American troops will be kept
in sutlieient numbers on the border
to make incursions of Mexican troops
unnecessary, but al the same time it
will avoid a controversy with General;
t'arranza at Ibis stage.
President Wilson and Secretary
I.;,using at a conference this afternoon
wore understood to have concluded to
send an Immediate reply to General
< 'arranza's note accepting his sugges
tion for a reciprocal agreement.
The acceptance probably will be made
on the ground that Carranza troops
may cross into American territory in j
pursuit of bands at any time that;
American forces are not present In
sufficient numbers. II will be pointed
out that the inability of the t'arranza ;
troops to handle the situation in j
Northern Mexico is the sole ground ]
for entry of American soldiers.
In thnt. way American officials ex
pected the situation will be relieved
of its chief menacing feature. They ;
expressed the view to-day that a :
sreat deal of unnecessary pessimism
exists as to General Carranza's atti
tude. As to the attitude of the Mex
ican people, themselves, however,
there is some concern, but it is
realized that only the developments
of the next few days can clear up that 1
phase of the situation.
I'lisli Preparations
There was no indication at the War,
Department that negotiations for reci
procal arrangements had in any way
altered the situation on the border.
Publication of Carranza's manifesto
declaring that armed invasion of
Mexico In pursuit of Villa would not
lie tolerated except on a reciprocal
basis, apparently has not resulted In

Wagon on Ann Street
Grade-Crossing
Elmer Reigle, son of Aaron Reigle,

west of Middlctown, had a narrow es
i cape from death early this morning
when his team was struck by an east
bound Pennsylvania passenger train
at the Ann street grade crossing, Mid

from his wagon an instant oefore the
' iiig engine trashed into it. The mule
drawing the vehicle was impaled on
the cow-catcher anil carried a distance
of over a hundred feet before it rolled
I off dead. The wagon was smashed to
kindling wood, the only piece of any
size le.ft intact being one of the

i bruises and was able to return to his
home.

I done and chances of any more aecl

$765,000 SUIT IS
FILED AGAINST
YORK ENGINEER
Involves Reconstruction of
Electrical Companies in and
Around Atlanta, Ga.
Suit for (lie recovery of $765,000 —
the largest sum that has ever figured
in local court records since the civil
actions in the eapitol cases—
was filed late Saturday in the Federal
courts for the Middle district of
Pennsylvania against W. H. Smith, a
well-known electrical construction en
gineer of Yor«c, Pa., by W. A. Carlisle,
of Atlanta, Ga.
Wickersham and Metager, of this
city, who have been retained by Car
lisle to serve with an Atlanta firm as
counsel in the case, filed the action
with J. Clarence Punk, resident clerk
to the Federal courts.
The suit dates back more than four
years and involves the reconstruction
of four or fire of the electrical com
panies in and around Atlanta and the
subsequent sale .of the rehabilitated
lines to the Atlanta Street Railway
and Power Company.
According to the local counsel, Car
lisle. together with Smith and John
Veardley, of New York, formed a
company to reorganize, reform and
re-equip and construct the various
lines and companies operating elec
trically in and around Atlanta. The
consolidation was effected and the At
lanta company eventually bought out
the holdings of the three, for ?2,300,-
000. Neither Smith nor »Yeardley ac
cording to Carlisle, divided a ahare of
the proceeds with Carlisle and he ac
cordingly brought the suit. Similar
a< tion it is understood, will be filed

"If tlio.se fellows down in Washing- j

Britishers that we know something;
about Christianizing a country."
So said the Rev. E. J. Pace, for ten
years a missionary in the islands and
at present a member of the editorial,
staff of the Religious Telescope, at this
morning's session of the laymen's Mis
sionary Movemosit of the National Mis
sionary Campaign.
Mr. Pace has the unique record, he
says, of being a home, fr6ntier and
foreign missionary at the saihe time,
first, because his labors in the Philip
pines were under the Stars and Stripes:
second, because while in those islands
he was as far on t lie frontier as it was
possible to get; and third, because the
islands are so tar from this country j
that they can be called foreign.
