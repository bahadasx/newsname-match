Shortage of rolling stock. Hen. Fred
erick Funston today said, was hinder
ing rhe concentration of cavalry at the
base of operations and this was one
reason why a movement today was un
likely. The fault, he said, lay with
the railroad west of EI Paso.
"We have even had to transport
men in box cars," he declared.
"If this had been merely an infantry
expedition we would have been into
Mexico on Villa's very heels.' he con
tinued "But this is largely a cavalry
movement and that is why there has
been delay."
Light was thrown on the size of the
expeditionary forces by the general,
who said:
"When this movement is completed
there will be only six or eight re
mmts l?ft in the I'nited States other
than those troops stationed along the
border for patrol duty."
There is little likelihood of militia
being called on to aid the regular
army unless there should be a turn :n
events thai would necessitate a more
importani expedition into Mexico than
the punitive expedition planned.
Would Call Out Entire Army.
"of course." said the general, if the !
Carranza government were unable to
control the "ituation and there should
be general opposition in Mexico to the f
entrance of American soldiers, the en- ,
tire regular army would have to be
employed in the movement and part
of the militia, too.
"Patrol duty along the border would
be delegated to the militia,"
It was niade clear that this eventu
ality fas not expected. There will be
no infantry or cavalry movement from
Fort Sam Houston for the present, it
was announced today.

on a London street today. A Brit

street car when a young woman,
dressed in deep mourning, a baby
in her arms, stepped on the plat
form. The child cried "Daddy"
with embarrassing enthusiasm on
seeing the officer. The passen
gers giggled, the officer blushed
but tears rushed into the eyes of
the young widow. In an instant
the tragedy of war was revealed to
everybody. The wounded officer
drew himself up stiffly and salut
ed the baby. This tribute to the
dead father froze any further
merriment and the incident was
closed.

REMOVES STUBBORN OBSTACLE
Mexico Considered It I". S. Evi
dence of Good Faith.
Now Either Army Can C ross in
Chase of Villa.
Washington, March 13. The
United States this afternoon ac
cepted General Carranza's pro
posal for a reciprocal agreement
by which either his troops or
American troops may pursue
bandits on either side of the bor
der. A note of acceptance was
sent forward to General Car
ranza at Queretaro.
No Hostile Intentions.
Army officials who studied the Car
ranaa manifesto were convinced that
it was not intended as a communica
tion to the United States in a hostile
sense. The head of the de facto gov
ernment, they pointed out. was in a
delicate political position, forced to
satisfy conflicting elements among his
own adherents in whatever course he
pursues. It was admitted, however,
that if Carranza enforced the senti
ments expressed in his manifesto the
pursuit of Villa might be hampered
seriously.
Wilson's Message Waits.
One question confronting President
Wilson is that of reaching a decision
as to whether or not it would be wise
to lay tho Mexican situation before
congress at this time. The president
himself is understood to have been in
clined to do so immediately after the
cabinet meeting last Friday, when it
was decided to send troops in pursuit
cf Villa. Some of his advisers, Jiov
ever, have felt that the action might
lie misconstrued in Mexico and the
expedition to pursue the bandits bo
magnified into the advance guard of
a movement to police all northern
Mexico. Great stress had been laid by
all administration officials on the
purely punitive character of the expe
dition that is to be sent over the bor
der. General Funston was assembling his
forces somewhere on the border today,
and three regiments of cavalry and
one of infantry were rushing to his
support from widely scattered points
in the United States. The cavalry was
ordered out at his request Saturday
night, some from the Pacific coast,
some from the middle west and some
from the south. The infantry regi
ment, the Twenty-third, now at Gal
veston, has been under orders to be in
readiness for several days. It will go
to El Paso and then be assigned by
General Funston to border duty.
Fear More Bandit Raids.
Secretary Baker explained the
movement f the Twenty -third by
saying great apprehension was felt in
many border towns that the Columbus
raid might be repeated. It is proposed
to give General Funston ample force,
both for expedition and to protect the
border residents. While strictest
secrecy was maintained by the war de
partment as to the force General Fun
ston had designated to pursue Villa,
information from the border pointed
to a force of cavalry, mountain artil
lery' and engineers which would total
between 5,000 and 6.000 men.
Would Swap Privilege.
Mexico City, March 13. General
Carranza last night issued a declara
tion that under no circumstances
would Mexico grant the right to the
United States to send in armed forces
to capture Villa without consent an
the reciprocal privilege being first ob
tained. Orders were sent to the con
fidential agent of the Mexican govern
ment, in Washington to make immedi
ate representations to this effect.
The news of the attack on Colum
bus by Villa and his followers was
first made public here yesterday, when
the official organ. El Pueblo, publish
ed the text of the note of the Mexican
government, asking the government at
Washington to permit the passage of
Mexican soldiers into American ter
ritory, if such became necessary in the
pursuit of Villa and at the same time
granting to the United States the re
ciprocal privilege of entering Mexican
territory for the same purpose.
The text of the note to General Car
ranza will he made public later today,
acmompanied by a statement which,
it is understood, will set forth that the
United States is not intervening in
Mexican affairs but is acting to obviate
the necessity of doing so.
Endorse Agreement.

be filed in an effort to establish the j Roth state and national banks made
unconstitutionality of the fee provision j hig gains in deposits during the six
of the censorship law.
Action will be taken by the movie
men in accordance with the program
of the oil producers. Recently the
Kansas supreme court said the fee
provision in the oil inspection law was
unconstitutional because it produced
a revenue of $120,000 a year from the
inspection of 1,200,000 barrt Is of oil
and gasoline. Now the movie produc
ers will attack the law as a revenue
measure because the state earned a
profit of $11,385.29 from the inspec
tion of 4.840 films.
There will be no love and friendship
spirit when the movie producers and
the state censorship department enter
the courts. If the state loses its case,
the movie men will not make a con
tribution to Kansas in accord with
the policies of the oil men but will
say things about Superintendent Ross
and the Rev. Festus Foster that no
newspaper will quote in full.
Producers Are Holding Ont
Following the plan of attack on the
fee provision of the state movie cen
sorship act, the producers are now
withholding from Kansas some of
their better feature attractions. None
of the really big films are now com
ing to Kansas. The really high elass
attractions on the screen in this state
are old productions and news has been
sent to Topeka that Kansas movie fans
will take such offerings as producers
care tc send and may make the most
of it. A number of film stars have
vigorously protested against the action
of Kansas censors and one report has
been sent to the effect that several
stars have stipulated in their contracts
that their films shall not be shown in
this state if deleted by censors.
Kansas movie men will hold their
state convention in Wichita March 2 0.
At that time they will talk over the
troubles that have occasioned distress
and sorrow and anger. They will also
take action concerning a suit to upset
the present state law. Without fees,
there is no money available with
which to maintain the inspection de
partment, unless revenues already de
rived can be made available. In the
oil inspection case, the department
was supported by a direct legislative
appropriation. The picture film de
partment, though, must earn its own
way.

London. March 13. The battle of
Verdun entered its fourth week today
with intense artillery battling around

early today about six hours after being

who left for the Mexican border.
Firemen attempting to extinguish
the flames found that the water sup

An investigation was started imme

The headquarters safe and the con

Columbus, March 13. Actual con
