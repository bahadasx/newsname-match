In response to the editorial en
titled ."Rot," that appeared In The

terances In last night's sermon, as
delivered In the First M. E. .church,
we, the undersigned ministers, co

to say:
First, That we heartily endorse,
in letter and spirit the position and'
deliverances of Dr. Mahood on the

od In his sermon last night In the
First M. E. church.
Second, At least two-thirds of the
fifteen hundred or more people that
heard the sermon came forward
and shook the hand of the evangel
ist and ministers giving their
hearty endorsement to Dr. Ma
hood's utterances, and pledging
themselves to live In line with the
.appeal of the sermon.
Third, The deliverances of Dr.

Wo slncerly feel that The Times
owes an apology to the seven
thousand church folks of this city

Statement to the Public
In view of articles which have ap peared within the put few days con
cerning the local gas situation, the undersigned feels the public should
know the facts; therefore, the following information Is given:
First?The natural gas situation generally in northern Weet Virginia,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and western Maryland has been more serious during
the past few months than at any time in its history, aa recent press re
ports well verify. This situation is due chiefly to an extraordinary de
mand from manufacturing centers drawing their'gas supply from the
northern and central West Virginia lields, and brought about by abnor
mal business conditions in various manufacturing lines. This extraordi
nary demand not only exceeded expectations, but was sudden in its oc
currence. It found not only the manufacturing centers unprepared to meet
the unusual increased activity, but also the gas companies not prepared
to supply the additional gas required, which has caused a reduction in
field pressures and a resultant decrease below anticipated volumes.
Second?The situation described became more acuta during the past
three months by reason of increased demands from domestic consumers
on account of the cold weather. Th e newspapers during, that period con
tained numerous articles in referen ce to serious shortages in various
cities and towns, to the extent that in some places the gas supply to fac
tories was shut off entirely, many men thrown out of employment, and
In one large city the public schools had to dismiss their pupils because
there was not sufficient gas to heat the buildings.
Third?More gas has bet-n dellve red to Fairmont during this winter
than any previous winter. The mon th of February, 1916, shows the high
est daily average consumption of gas In the history of the industry in
Fairmont.
Fourth?This company had an adequate gas supply during the winter
of 1914-15, but to provide for additional demands it began early in 1915 to
drill more wells and procure an Increased supply-of gas. Since January
1, 1915, it has drilled 10 wells, purchased gas on contract from 10 others,
had three wells drilling at this time, and has increased its available sup
ply over last year, notwthstanding the reduction in Held pressure. Of
the 10 wells drilled, three were unproductive; four were light; two test
ed 1,000,000 cubic feet each, and on e about 2,000,000 cubic feet. The last
well described Is six miles from the company's lines In new territory that
is being developed and the gaa from it Is not available now. Before next
winter this new territory will be"drilled and it is beleved enough gas
developed to jUBtfy the laying of six miles of six-inch line to secure addi
tional and new reserve supply. The company had added about 10,000
acres to Its leased territory during the past year.
Fifth?Tlie company is well aware that on several of the coldest days
recently its supply of gas has not b een entirely adequate for full opera
tion of all factories after the domestic consumers were properly supplied,
and it regrets the, fact exceedingly. It feels, however, that It has done
everytSlng'iin Its power,to secure sufficient gas to take care of the de
fgands, and thera/lsgome satisfaction.In the knowledge.thatjt Jia?. cared j
'ftuOlIt'ilio st "others" have done. It wTO continue
jwto exert'every effort'that'ean be ex pecteil of-it to meot Fairmont's de
mands.
Sixth?It is not-this company's policy to participate In newspaper dis
cussions, and it will have nothing further to say on this matter, but for
the reason flrst given It'.has tried to present the; true situation.

Some Concern at Washing
ton Over Attitude of
Mexicans.
NO MOVEMENT TODAY
Officially Announced That
Brigadier General Persh- j
ing Will Command.
(By Associated Press)
WASHINGTON, War.. IS?The Uni
ted States will reply to General Car
ranza's request tor a reciprocal ar
rangement tor crossings of troops at
the Mexican border late today after
Secretary Lansing has conferred with
President Wildon. 10 was Indicated
that Carranza's proposal would be ac
cepted.
The proposal will probably be made
on the grounds that Carranza troops
may crosB into American territory In
pursuit of bandltB at any time that
American forces are "not present in
sufficient numbers. It will be point
ed out that the Inability of Carranza
troops to handle the situation in north
ern Mexico Is tho sole ground for en
try of American soldiers. In that way
American officials expect the situation
will be relieved of Its chief menacing
feature. They express the view today
that a great deal of unnecessary pes
simism exists as to General Car
ranza's attitude.
As to the attitude of the Mexican
people, there Is some concern, but It
Is realized that only the development
of the next few days can clear up that
phase of the situation.
SAN ANTONIO, March 13?No

not consent to American troopB enter
ing Mexico unless Carranza troops
were allowed to enter the United
States.
It waa officially announced that
Brigadier General John Pershing will
command the expeditionary forces.
General Funston said he had re
ceived no notification from Washing
ton to hold back the expedition while
negotiations were being completed
with Carranza.
