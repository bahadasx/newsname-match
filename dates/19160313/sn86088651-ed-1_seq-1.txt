confer.
It Is Indicated the Carrama pro
posal will be accepted. Secretary of
War Baker reiterated his promises to
day that he will make the newa public
aa aoon aa he la notified that the
troops hare crossed the border.
The acceptance of Carrama'e propo
sition will propably be on the ground
that Carranza troops may cross Into
I'nlted Statea territory In pursuit of
bandits at any time the American
forces are not sufficient to cope with
the bandits
The army officiate who have studied
the Carrama manifesto are convinced
that It was not Intended that the Mex
ican troops would ever cross the bor
der, but that General Carrama waa
forced to satisfy conflicting elements
among hla own adherents, eome of
whom are very bitterly opposed to al
lowing I'nlted Statea troopa to enter
their country.
