nez, CaU to promote and Introduce
game fishing to the mainland 'people,
the first game : fishing boat ever
brought to the Islands arrived , tnia

by Captain Mardon, who is a well
known fisherman around Avalon.:The
Crete is especially arranged for game
fishing, and has every feature that
is needed. :: ;"'
It'has a deep cock pit,- side chair
especially fitted for landing big fish,
and on the back deck are leather poc
kets for the placing of the pole. There

Crete there to be placed in use for
fishing parties leaving from that point

the present fishermen In the city will
result in more of the boats being

Remember "Baby. Week"
By Ermine Cross, Director of the Castle Kindergarten.
The last decade has ushered in a new basis of; life, the beginning ol
a more perfect social order. V
Welfare workers from time Immemorial hav'e had as their aim the
building up of character. The aim remains the same, but with the awak
en '.ng of our social visicn we'have come to see that the best means to
this end lies in better conditions of industry, fewer burdens, happier
homes, larger lives. . -. . .
The children are the great gainers of the. new order. Their lives will
always bear the stamp and mark the degree of our "loving vision for hu
manity.' "..'. .'.."'.', :
Baoy Week In Honolulu should touch the warm spot in every heart,
and the following prayer for babies written by Rauschenbusch may awaken
many of us to even a deeper sense of our responsibility to the "utter help
lesaness" of babyhood. - '- ' v
"God, since Thou hast laid the little children into our arms in utter
helplessness, with no protection save our love, we pray that the sweet ap
peal of their baby hands may not be in vain. Let no innocent life in our
city be quenched again in useless pain through our Ignorance and sin. If
there are any who were kissed by lov in their own Infancy, but who have
no child to whom they may give as they received, grant them such large
ness of sympathy that they may i rejoice to pay their debt in full to all
children who have need of them. Amen." .':'.';'.".!;

BABY WEEK PLAN
FOR THIS CITY
Although he kindly but firmly re
fused to talk upon any other subject,
Dr. Charles W. Mayo, one of the world
famous Mayo Brothers,, surgeons,' of
Rochester, Minnesota, who arrived on
the Great Northern this morning,
gives his hearty approval of plans for
a Baby Week in Honolulu, to reduce
infant mortality in this city through
a campaign of education.
"Although I do not anow any de
tails of the Baby Week campaign in
Honolulu, 1 do know that similar ef
forts are being made throughout the
entire United States," says Dr. Mayo,
who Is one of the most eminent sur
geons in America.
"If we are going to save people we
muht begin with the babies. In the
East they are doing It in facVpver
the entire country. In the saving of
the lives of babies is where the great
est advance has-been made In medi
cine in recent years.
' While medical science has been
able to add a number of years to the
average length of human life, this has
been accomplished by the saving of
children '8 lives, not adding years to
the lives of adults.
Progress In 30 Years. ',
"Jn the last 100 years the average
length of human life has been extend
ed from 12 to 20 years, varying accord
ing to the locality. It is in the last
30 years, however, that the most pro
gress has been toward the saving of
babies and children's lives."
Dr. Mayo says this is his first trip
to the islands, and that he and Mrs.
Mayo are going to see as much of
them as : possible -between now and
Thursday night, when they will re
turn to the mainland on the Great
Northern. Dr. Mayo declared Kilauea
volcano,-which he Baw yesterday, to
be a magnificent sight"
The distinguished surgeon was met
at Pier 6 this morning by the execu
tive committee.of the Medical Society
of Hawaii, including Dr. B. D. Kil
bourne, its president; and Dr. C B.
Wood, A. F. Jackson and A. G. Hod

. LONDON Eng March 13. The
court of appeals-today handed down
a decision allowing appeal in the
Sllngsby legitimacy suit
This is one of the most noted cases
in legal annals and has been
fought ut in American courts for the
Iast 'several years. The case arose
over charges that another baby was
substituted for little "Teddy" Slingsby,
son of Lieut and Mrs. C. R. Slingsby
and heir to $500,000 property of 'the
Slingsby family in Yorkshire, Eng
land. The substitution was alleged to
have been made in San Francisco.
The claim was made that the real
Slingsby baby, which was born in
San Francisco on September 1, 1910,
died and that the mother substituted
another infant.
After the case had been thrashed
out in San Francisco, the evidence
was submitted to the probate court
in London, which on February 3, 1915,
decided that' the present Slingsby
bly is legitimate and that no sub
stitution was made. It is from this
decision .that an-appeal has now been
allowed. Sir Edward Carson, Union
ist leader and until recently a member
of the British coalition cabinet has
been leading counsel fqr the contest
ant of the child's right to the estate.

ELECTED AGAIN
Cyrus H. K. Curtis, Publisher of
Saturday Evening Post, Says
Policies are Unpopular
That Wood row Wilson has very lit
tle chance for re-election to the office
of president of the United States in
the coming fall campaign, because of
the simple reason that the. majority
of people are opposed to him is the
belief of Cyrus K. ; Curtis, publish
er of The -Ladies' Home Journal and'
The Saturday Evening Post, who, with
Mrs. Curtis, arrived this morning on
the Great Northern. . . -
"I don't believe" said Mr. Curtis
to the Star-Bulletin this morning, "that
President Wilson has any chance of
sitting in the White House chair for
a second administration. , S. ' .
"Of course those things are run by
politics, and things political are hard
to judge. Something may happen at
the last moment to elect him again,
but looking at it from the present
viewpoint, I should say this is un
Ifkely." '
Afraid of Roosevelt
Neither does Mr. Curtis look upon
Roosevelt as a likely choice, even If
he should get the nomination. He saya
the people are afraid of Roosevelt's
policies, believing that they might get
the country into war.
"Many people feel that President
Wilson has shown a lack of judgment
In: the manner In which he has han

publisher. '
"I consider Supreme Justice. Charles
E. Hughes aa the most popular man
in the United States for vote getting,
he continues. . "Senator Elihu Root

many persons." -
Mr. Curtis says his individual choice
for the position of president is Sen
ator John W. Wiek8 of Massachusetts,
but the publisher does not believe that

file's not from the right1 state, and
so he has no chance." Mr. Curtis
says, "but still you can never tell what

most anything may occur."
Speaking of what the war has done

that the publishing ousiness has beer J

He says that the Mexican situation
