—Part of Force to Encir
cle Expedition.
El Paso, Tex., March 13.—In spite
of official denials, reports persisted
here today that American cavalry on
the Arizona side had gathered for an
immediate crossing of the Mexican
border and that they might go across
at any motrient..
The advance guard of several cav
alry troopsSvasct)Hictod on that- bor
der two days ago with the prospect
that it might be the first force into
MeJfleo. The point where the cavalry
expedition Is reported as gathering to
enter Mexico is on the Arizona boun
dary near San Bernardino, Mexico.
A reassuring conference was held
here between General Pershing and
General Gavira. During the confer
ence word arrived from Washington
unofficially that General Carranza's
request to cross the American border
might be granted.
Daylight revealed the beginnings of
the expeditionary force which the
United: Statfes is gathering along the
border west of here for the pursuit of
Villa. Six mountain guns, unloaded
during the night, are in readiness at
Columbus, the scene of Villa's raid,
the first armed camp to develop evi
dences that it had been selected as
one of the starting points for a pursuit
column. Fifty-seven carloads of bat
tery mules and transports for the ani
mals also arrived, and gave evidence
that more two-inch guns are coming.
Eleven hundred men were in camp
this morning. About 200 miles west
of here troop trains were reported
passing various points during the
night, as the result of orders released
Friday by the war department.
Activity at Nogales.
What points, except Columbus,
might be used to assemble pursuit
columns were not developed, but con
siderable activity was noted on the
Arizona border near Nogales, and also
near the small Mexican settlement,
called San Bernardino. In that re
gion several troops of cavalry were
reported in readiness for action. A
column entering Mexico from one of
these Arizona border points would
have a fairly direct route to the
mountain passes in Sonora, through
which apprehension has been express
ed that Villa might escape from the
Chihuahua territory, into which he re
treated. Nogales reported that a few
cannon had been discovered in the
Mexican hills, facing the American
boundary near the city, but elsewhere
along the line where American troops
are gathered no signs of disquieting
activity along the Mexican side were
reported.
Carranza Troops at Palomas.
Reports here that army officers at
Columbus are puzzled at the attitude
of the Carranza troops a few miles
across the boundary, were flatly de
nied upon investigation. Army infor
mation is that 2,500 Carranza troops
had gathered at Palomas, about 12
miles across the line from Columbus,
and that the conduct of these troops
is exemplary. These Palomas troops
are part of the great ring that Car
ranza officers at Matamoros say they
are drawing about the desert and
mountain refugees of Villa.
The northern sector of this ring
appears to be gathering in a position
to make it rest between Villa and the
assembling American columns on the
American side of the border.
MUTINY TAKES PIjACE.
Petrograd, March 13, (via London)
—Telegraphing from Dvinsk, the cor
respondent of the Boerse Gazette re
ports that a mutiny has taken place
among the men of the German gar
risbn at Shavli. a town in the Baltic
provinces, owing, it is said, to insuffi
cient food.
The mutiny was suppressed by
cavalry the correspondent adds, aft
er one .officer and three soldier had
been killed and a large number of
men wounded. Nine of the ringlead
ers of the movement are said to have
been tried by courtmartial and exe

General Funston said he had re
ceived no official notification from
Washington to hold back the expedi

completed with Carranza..
General Funston said that the an
nouncement of the expedition's actual
start into Mexico probably would
come from General Pershing to whom
woiilld be left the decision as to the
exact hour for setting the movement
afoot.:
Rolling Stock Shortage.
A shortage of rolling stock, Genera)
Funston said, was hindering the con
centration of cavalry at the base of
operatibns, this being one reason why
army movement today was unlikely.
The fault, he said, rested with the
railroads west of EI Paso.
"We have been transporting men in
box cars," he said. "If this had been
merely an infantry expedition, we
could have been in Mexico on Villa's
very heels," Funston continued, "but
this is largely a cavalry movement
and that is why there has been delay."
Big Kxpedition.
Light was thruwn on the size of
the expeditionary forces by General
Funston who said:
"When this movement is completed
there will be only six or eight regi
ments left in the United States other
than those troops stationed along the
border for patrol duty."

POTATO CARDS
Will BE USD)
According to Reports These
^intake-Stare Along with
Bread an^ButterGards.
Berlin, March 13.—Potato cards,
the issuance of which was made
necessary by the shortage, due, it is
asserted to speculators holding out for
higher prices, will take their places
alongside the bread and butter cards
in Berlin on'March 20.
The first cards will cover a sixty
day period and allow the holders to
purchase eleven. English pounds of
potatoes every twelve days, probably
at the uniform price of 65 pfennings.
The government potato situation dur
ing the sixty days will determine
whether the plan must be continued.
In announcing this step. Burgomas
ter von Wermuth said that the popu
lation had of late been living, so far
as potatoes are concerned, from hand
to mouth. He anticipated, however,
that all the difficulties would be over
in a. few days.
Owing to the recent shortage in
bread, the military authorities has
forbade the production of all cakes
between March 13 and March 19. in
clusive, made of white or potato
flour, and their sale between March
15 and 19. This step was taken on
the complaint of many bakers that
others bakers who are not short of
flour, were using it for cakes, rather
than for bread. The shortage is due
to unequal distribution, which is ex
pected to be remedied within the
week.
