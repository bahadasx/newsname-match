Uolumbus, N. Mex.. March I.-Distinct
unfrienuliness manifested by the Car

seven miles south of here. on Friday
night has led to great uneasinesw not only
among the civilian population bit in
military circles as well. Army officers
admit they are Periously puzzled.b* the
attitude of the Carranzistas.
Distrust or the Mexican. is so great
that army offtiers ha'c refused to per
mit Americans to cross the border to
Palomas. It is also indicated that no
troops will move south from thus place
until some definite Information Is ob
tained as to the future course of action
of the Carranzistas. and a definite pledge
obtained from Carranza. To leave this
force of armed Mexicans in the rear of
an invading force without being assured
of their nonhostile intentions, It is point
ed out by men high in the army councils
here, would be the greRtest of folly.
2,00 Mexicans Gather.
Gen. B3ertani, in command of the Car
ranazita forces. refuses to discuss his
possible course when American troops
rross the line. Illis army is rapidly in
creasing and. according to information
obtained today, will number fully 2.000
by tomorrow night. A general opinion
prevails If even Bertani and his officers
should desire to (o-operate with the
American forces the greater part of the
soldiers would mutiny and cast in their
lot with Villa.
That bandit leader tonight is reported
at Corralitos Ranch. eighty miles to the
south, where he is said to be slaughtering
cattle and carrying on a campaign of
terror.
I'noffi, ial reports tonight are to the effect
that Wednesday is the day chosen for
the first movement into Mexico from
this point. The Thirteenth Cavalry, troops
of which were engaged with the Villistas
during and after the Columbus massacre,
will lead the advance.
Re-enforcements Arrive.
Big re-enforcements are reaching the
scene, and today was one of preparation.e
The Eighth Cavalry from Fort Bliss is
expected early in the morning, and the
iSixteenth Infantry is also on its way.
Traiiloads of supplies of all kinds are
pouring in and large ammunition stores
are being gathered.
l.arge numbers of United States special
agents also are arriving at border points
in this vicinity to run down Yilla (ples,
with whlch the section is infested.
Another Mexican was found killed by
bullet wounds outside the town this
morning. It is believed that there are
numerous bodies of Mexicans in the
brush where they were shot down by in
furiated residents of this section on sus
picion that they were plotting against
the United States,
One of the wounded Mexicans taken
prisoner durIng the raId was sent to El

BORLANO'S NEW
PLAN FULL OF
VITAL OEFECTS
Opponents Expect to Easily
Block Substitute on Point
of Order.
CLEARLY NOT GERMANE
Amendment Proposes Permanent
Changes Not Applicable to Appro
priations Bill Covering Year.
By JOSEPH P. ANNI-N.
Although Representative Borland. In
order to bring his indefensible and un
provoked attack uton government clerks
in Washington within the rules of the
hlouse, has forfeited virtually all the sut
port he might have expected from mem
bers of the House by ordering an arbi
trary reouction of one-tenth in the num
ber of government leorks, parliamen
tarians believe that the substitute can
be eliminated on a point of order as was
the original proposal.
The substitute is held to be vulnerable
on two Important points, first, because
it is clearly not germane to the subject
tinatter of the bill, and second, because
it contains two substantive proposals, one
of which, in addition to not being ger
mane, modifies existing law without
necessarIly effecting retrenchnent.
The Holman rule, which the substitute
seeks te come in under, provides that
under no circumstances shall an amend
ment to an appropriation bill be consid
ered modifying existing law, unless it
is germane to the subject matter of the
,bill. The rule reads:
"Nor shall any provision in any 5,ch
bill or amendment thereto changing cx
isting law be in order, except such as
being germane to the subject matter of
the bill shall retrench expenditures by
the reduction of the number and salary
of the officers of the United States. etc."
The Borland amendment provides:
"That the number of persons In the
classified service in the several executive
departmnents ~and other executive estab
Ushments and the government of the Dis
trict of Colattpbla shall be reduced by
one-tenth 'oni efore June 30. 1917, etc."
Not G;ermane to Bill.
The lepislative. executive and judicial
appionriation bill makes appropriations
for the fiscal year ending .une 30, 1917.
The subject matter of the bill Is not
general or permanent law, hut the ap
propriations necessary for the mainte
nance of these establishments for that
one year. .s the Borland amendment
does not require any reductions before
the end of the fiscal year covered by the
hill, It must he taken for granted that
no reductions will be made before that
time. Clearly,. then, the amendment is
not germane to the subject matter of the
bill. in the opinion of parliamentarians
of the Ilouse.
On the second point or vulnerabiliy. the
proposal that clerks be- required to work
not less than eight hours is clearly not
germane to the subject matter of the
hill. which affects means for paying saLa
ilea and upkeep of government depart
ments. Furthermore. the first proposal
in the amendment, that the force of gov
ernment clerks be reduced one-tenth. is
in no way dependent upon the second pro
posal that government clerks he re
quired to work eight hours, or vice versa.
Therefore, the amendment is separable
into two distinct substantive proposals,
against either of which a point of orde;
might lie. As there is clearly no effort
to reduce expenditures through the sec
ond proposal (to extend the hours of
labor), considered spart from the first
proposal, the second part does not come
within the exceptions of the Hulman rule
and is subject to a point of order. Under
the rules of the House, If any part of an
amendment is out of order, the entire
amendment goes out.
Borland Still Hangs On.
Mr. Borland has a third proposal which
he has prepared in anticipation of the de
feat of his second one, now pendin;.
Ills third proposal seeks to establish its
germaneness by requiring that the reduc
tion be made effeetive June 30 next. This
does not clearly malm- the proposal ger
mane, however, and further sacrifices
votes of members in considering the
atlendment on its merits.
District day in the House probably will
be passed over today to afford oppor
tunity to finish' up on lhe legislative bill.
District bills may be taken uo If the
House disposes of the legislativ-e bill
quickly enough.
Hunger Drives Down Moose.
Lander, Wyo., March 12.-For the first
time in many years a band of moose is
-now seen daily grazing near Dubois,
where thousands of elk, deer and ante
lope have been feeding with cattle for
some time. Only the very deepest snow
will drive moose out of the mountains,
as the animals are very wild, But in
their present half-famished condition the
moose mingle with the cattl, and wild
elk, seemingly without fear.
