Dead Cover Ground
in Front of Vatix
Paris, March IS.—The German
losses in the fighting arpuni) Fort
Vaux, last Friday and Saturday,
surpassed all previous records in
this war,' according tp officers who
had. returned from Verdun. Time
and time again and with great
courage, the. Germans, In columns
four deep, rushed from their
trenches only to meit away under
fire of the French guns. When the
smoke and dust cleared -nothing:
was to be seen but heaps of Jtodles.
The fighting was extremely des
perate when regiment® from the
I^f teenth and Eighteenth army
corps ^attacked the village of Vaux
on Friday. Dawn was breaking
and over the country hung a heavy
white mist, making everything in
visible beyond a hundred yards.
This enabled the Germans to get
within rushing distance of the
French front trenches, but altho
they outnumbered the defenders
six to one, it took four distinct as
saults before the Germans won a
shelter of a small group of houses
beyond the church of Vaux.
They then organized an assault
upon the church, and the French,
being unable to bring up reinforce
ments, withdrew their advanced
elements.

Incendiary Fire
Partially Destroys
Monterey Barracks
Monterey. Cal., March 13.—The
headquSrteris Ijulldlng of tfie Mon
terey presWlift was. totally de
stroyed by ^as^ ewl^this morning,
about six iuiijtB aiter«being vacated
by troops oft tlte First cavalry, who
left for the, Msxloan border.
Firemen attempting to extin
guish the flames found that the
water supply had been shut off at
the source. r\
An Investigation was started im
mediately by caretakers left In
charge.
Monterey was the Spanish and
Mexican capital of California and
the presidio occupies the site of the
ancient military headquarters. The
py^t was an uncompleted one, de
scribed by militlry authorities as
a sort of cantottment. with old
wooden barracks' sufficient to ac
commodate a regjment. The mon
etary loss, it was- said, is of small
amount.
The blaze Itself was compara
tively brief. The leaping flames
outlined the grass-covered para
pets of the old earthworks thrown
UP by an American landing party
in184€, and evej* lighted the abode
bouse where a little later Gen. W.
T*. Sherman, then a lieutenant,
lived, and what was the American
consulate.
The .headquarters safe and the
contents of the postoffice were
saved all other records and pa
pers were destroyed."
Maj. James G. Harboard, in
charge of the post, refused to dis
cuss the origin of the fire until he
had make hi» own investigation.
Much weight wai given by military
authorities, it became known, to
the fact that thg fire started in the
headquarters building.
Probably the- first Information
wa? received in telephone head
quarters In Monterey where the
switchboard lamps connected with
the army began'to wh»k. The op
erators, however, were unable to
"reach" the post and later said the
signals must have been caused by
the burning out of the post switch
board.

said preparations for the expedition

Mexico unless Carranza troops might

It was officially announced that Gen.
John J. Pershing will command the

General Funston said he had received
no notification fram Washington to

General Funston said today that the
announcement of the expedition's ac

come from General Pershing.
Car Shortage Delays Start.
Shortage of rolling stock. General
Funston said, was hindering the con

The fault, he said, lay with the rail
roads west of El "Paso.
"We have even had to transport men
In box cars." he declared. "If this had
been merely an Infantry expedition we
could have been in Mexico on Villa's
very heels. But this is a cavalry move
ment and that has been the cause of
the delay."
"When this movement Is- completed
there will be only six or eight regi

would' be delegated to the militia."
It was made clear that this even

There will be no infantry or cavalry
movement from Fort Sam Houston, for
the present.
The First Aero squadron. Capt. Ben

American troops may pursue

In practice It will have no effect
because American troops will be

Open Zone Proposed.
•Senators Stone and Saulsbury. .©rthe

the Mexican situation with President
Wilson today and learned that the
president believes a reciprocal arrange

established In which both nations
might have the right of pursuit of ban
