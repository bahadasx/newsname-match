Washington, . Mar. 13. President
Wilson will bo able, the administra
tion believes, to conduct an expedi
tion against "Pancho" Villa with
out meeting opposition from Provi
sional President Curranxa. ,
Although no word was to be had
from Wilson, offldals were convinced
Co-inzu's request for "military re
.jlproalty" would bu granted.
The Mexican embassy's assurances
that tho belllcoHe-soundlng Cnrranxa
manifesto suffered In translation, and
that his resentment against the In
vasion Is no strongor than was
evinced In the more formal note of
Saturday, tend to confirm tho view
that Carransa would not start
trouble.
i No news that the expedition had
moved across the border was forth
coming, ,
President Wilson will confer with
Secretary Lansing at 3 p. m. and
frame a reply to Carramsa'a note.
This ia to Tie forwarded at once.
. It la bolteved Prealdent Wilson has
the right to accept the proposition
without senatorial action. Official
dom generally, however, was rather
uneasy about Mexico. General Fun
ton's report that lie would move de
liberately until sure of his ground
was accepted aa proper procedure in
view of the unsettled state of the
negotiations. The fear waa expressed
that should Carransa'a note be ac
cepted, Villa will spread reports that
the expedition's purpose was to in
vade and subjugate Mexico. Wlth
this slogan, 'he oould undoubtedly
rally many to his support.
Miss Vera Holland, Who spent sev

Hyatt, at Santa Rofo, returned this

EGYPT AHD SUEZ
CANAL ARE SAFE
By William 0. Shepherd.
Rome, Mar. 13. Egypt and the
Sues canal are absolutely safe from
tho Germans for at least ono more
year.
While In Athens, I obtained this
Information direct from a reliable
source In Constantinople. The Greek
censorship prevented It being senl at
that time.
February was tho lust month when
the shifting desert sands east of the
canal were firm enough to sustain
marching columns.' The movement
of artillery and supply wagons on the
desert will be Impossible for months.
Stories that the Germans are build
ing rullroads and supply roads In the
desert are .fabrications. They caused
great amusement In Constantinople,
where the character of the desert re
gion is well known.
German . staff experts estlmatod
'that rnmels, traveling from the end
of the Damascus railway toward the
canal, could carry only five pounds of
ammunition each, besides their own
forsge. This tended to dlssolvo.tbe
Arabian Nights' dream picture of
'long camel trains moving enormous
supplies of munitions toward the
canal. '
Egypt and Sues are left out of
the Turkish-German plans for a year
to come, at least. Tho Germans, how
ever, will continue to threaten the
canal, hoping the British will be
frightened Into keeping (00,000 men
idle in Egypt,

Provisional President of Southern Republic Agrees to the

Washington, Mar. 13. Secretary
of Slate Lansing announced tbla af

reached an agreement with General
Carransa with regard to Americas
troops entering Mexico, and with re

position made by the Mexican first
chief. . -, ''-y.
It ia believed the agreement la a
modification' in some parts of Car
ranxa'a proposals in his proclamation
Issued yesterday. Secretary Lansing
gave out the following assurances to
Mexicans:
In order to remove any apprehen
sions which may exist la either the
United States or Mexico, the presi
dent has authorised me to give In his
name public assurance that the mili
tary operatlona in contemplation will
be atrlctly confined . to the order al
ready announced, that in no circum

croach in any degree on Mexico's sov
ereignty or develop into Intervention
of any kind In the international af
fairs of our slBter republic. On the
contrary, what Is now being, done Is
deliberately intended to preclude the
possibility of intervention."
El Paso, Mar. 13.- Threatened
with organised resistance by an
aroused Mexico, Uncle Sam's expedi

was still held in leash today.
Regiments of Infantry, artillery,
cavalry and engineers and forces of
all army branches are en route in

LTANY POSSIBILITIES SAYS BORAH
Washington, Mar. 18. "If we
think we can whip Mexico In a few
weeks, we will be woefully surprised.
I believe Francisco Villa will become
a national hero there' and that sixty
thousand men may rally about him."
Senator Chamberlain made this de
claration during a warm debate In
the sonate today.
His remark interrupted Senator
Dorah's speech joining Senator Fall
of New Mexico in opposing a "reci
procal military agreement". with Car
ransa. "The United States has entered up
on an enterprlae the future of which
la not to be forecasted," said Borah.
"I am not criticizing the president,
but we must seriously consider the
momentous step taken. We may have
started a train of eventa the result
of which we can not foresee. Where
the events lead,' we must face the
consequences, The Mexican situation
Is not the only one which blda ua be

It would be neither wise nor proper
for me to dlscuBS, but the president
says he can not tell us what tomor

Mexicans as fighters, Sonator Mc
Cumber said they were mostly Ignor

Senator Smoot where ( the Mexicans
got their rifles.

posed Senntor Warren, "We made a

General Funston's policy of thorough
preparedness before advancing, and
the negotiations of Washington diplo
mats with a defiant Carransa, may
cause further delay.
General Carransa'a threatened op
position, and Villa's flight toward set
tlements of American Mormons, who
are at bis mercy, .have torn the bor

fear. ' - '- ; v.; , : j'
, The problem of seising all northern
Mexican railways and preparing to
fight both Carransa and Villa, now
confronts army heads.
. Carransa officials already have ex
perienced trouble suppressing a mu
tinous spirit ' against Americans;
Anti-American demonstrations were
reported from several points. '
Consul Marlon Letcher, at Chlhu

Villa waa last reported heading
southward from Corralltos toward
Can Buena Ventura, near the Mor
mon settlements. It is evident he is
either determined to execute his
threat of wiping out the American
colony, or else fleeing toward the
mountains to hide from the Yankee
pursuit. '
It Is believed the bandit chief has

"Mexico now well knows all our
faellltles for making war," said
Sinoot. "They know they've got more
machine guns than we. I know the
senator from Oregon was right when
he said we could not get over 30,000
men to the border within thirty days
and that they must face a Mexican
army of at least 60,000 or 70,000
men, all well disciplined and equip
ped." "Can't we use the militia in invad
ing Mexico?" demanded Senator Sim
mons." '; ' ' ; ' -
Chamberlain replied:
' The national guardsmen oould he
used as border patrols. They are not
trained like the regulars, and many
doubt their effectiveness in warfare.
This la not simply a case of chasing
a few bandits. We are about to fight
a big force that has been fighting and
training for several years. , We need
not flatter ourselves that Mexico
that Europe does not know all
about our armies." ' ,
Senator Fall denounced "military
reciprocity" with Carransa. He said:
"If we allowed this agreement with
Carransa we would be allowing ban
dits on our soil who might prove as
deadly as tho Columbus murderers,"
declared Fall. "Carransa la not sin

to com on American soil. He wants
to argue, parley and palaver. Such

FOR PEACE SHOULD
HII BE Till
Washington, Mgr. 13. -It was au
thoritatively stated today President
Wilson has been informed of the
peace terms Berlin is likely tc make
if Verdun falls.
Colonel E. M. House, the presi
dent's emissary to Europe, was said
to have been presented the tentative
terms as modified by recent months
of warfare. He did not go to Berlin
for that especial purpose, but while
there be did receive an outline of the
propositions.
High German officials here testify
to the correctness of , his outline,
which says the kaiser will make the
following demands:
Return of all German colonies.
No indemnities.
, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania to
be divided between Austria, Bulgaria
and Greece. ;
Autonomy for Poland.
Freedom of Turkey from British
Influence. : . ,
Germany to return Belgium and
northern France.
Russia to assume possession of
Persia. , . , ;
Great Britain to remain as at pre
sent, neither giving nor receiving
anything. . .
High authorities said neither side
waa in a position to demand Indem
nltles. With regard to the kaiser re
taining Belgium, it was said:
"There is no longer any thought
of that la, Germany,!,
FORT D0llf.1T
London, Mar. " 13. Fighting at
Verdun entered its fourth week to
day, with reports of terrific artillery
work around Forts Douaumont, De
Vaux and Bethlncourt, evidently In
preparation for more infantry opera
tions. . "- ''
All day Sunday ' German' cannon
searched the French front with a hall
of projectiles. The French accepted
this aa forecasting new attempts
against Fort De Vaux and the posi
tions southwest of Verdun.- They
are prepared to meet whatever the
day may bring forth .
Berlin dispatches admit the Ger
mans no longer hold Fort De Vaux.
Paris credited the Germans with
great bravery, but reiterated that the
Teutona never entered the tort It-
self. According to French accounts.
a Posen regiment first charged Into
Vaux village, then emerged from. It
and ran toward the fort, which stands
300 feet above the plain.
"French officers say they never
saw Germans sacrifice their lives so
recklessly," said a Paris dispatch.
"They repeatedly ' debouched from
their trenches and attacked In ranks
four-deep, smothered hy the French
fire. Six and eight Inch shells ex
ploded right on top of the huddled
Germans. When the smoke and dust
cleared, nothing could be seen but a
mass of tangled bodies. The spur on
which the fort stands Is in many
places almost perpendicular. When
they reached its steep sides, the main
force of Germans was 'obliged to
halt, but many Bavarian reserves
struggled up the slope amid a hall of
bullets. They climbed on one an
other's shoulders, hanging to the
sharp angles of rocks and grasping
tutta of grass. Repeatedly, however,
their human pyramids collapsed into
shapeless gray masses.
"Where the slopes were not so
steep, the German attack was con
centrated and the ditches red with
their blood. Finally their officers
halted the butchery and the fighting
stopped. They must at the very low
est estimates have lost more than
two-thirds of their strength." '
Mrs. A. J. Ford returned to Rose-
burg this morning, after spending a
few days, with Mrs. W. I McDonald.

London, Mar. 13. Northeast and
southeast of Verdun the earth Is
shaking today nnder an Incessant and
ever-growing pounding of artillery.
The fight is extending along a
carving front southeast of the for
tress, according to communications
by both sides. ',' -v; f'.
When shells have shattered and
destroyed everything . not strong
enough to withstand blow after blow
from high explosives, It is believed
German Infantry will dash forward
again over ground which has already
been repeatedly drenched In blood.
Paris says the French await the new
thrust confidently.
. Both Paris and Berlin reported the
struggle most severe at La Petre, 4S
miles southeast of the citadel. .Ia
the Cannes forest , the French sud
denly leaped from their positions and
Stormed over 200 yards of trenches,
capturing 20 'Germans who did not
have time to escape before the
Frenchmen swarmed upon them, ac
cording to Parts accounts. J
Aviators resumed operations. A
French air squadron swooped down
on the Conflaus railway station and
sent 30 bombs crashing into it Other
bombs were dropped on the railroad
yards, but the machines circled up
ward and sped back to their home
base before the German machines got
off the ground, declared Paris. -;
In return, a German aerial flotilla
sped over the Clermont and Verdun
railway stations, dropping numerous
missiles through their roofs.
Berlin declared that in the Cham

French aeroplanes were shattered by
shrapnel - and brought tumbling to

WATER POWER BILL
Washington, Mar. ,13. President
Wilson today promised to take a hand
In the fight over the Shields water
power bill, which conservationists de
nounced as a vicious measure. '
President Wilson told Congress
man Kent that It was better to let
the water power run to waste than
wrongly to settle the question of
how It should be used. He Intimated
he would veto the Shields bill unless
It was radically amended. ' "
Kent asked the president to have
Secretary Baker immediately give his
attention to the question Involved in
the Shields controversy the control
of water power In navigable streams.
The war department has Jurisdiction
over such bodies of water.
"We are making a fight against'
people who thoroughly realize that
immense fortunes are to be gained if
they win," Kent wrote the president
"Without fear of contradiction, I
again state that for influence and lob
bying the water power crowd Is the
shrewdest and moat dangerous lot of
people we have to fight In thts coun
try today.",
The president wrote Kent in reply:'
"You may be sure I shall call Sec
retary Barker's attention to this mat
ter at the earliest possible moment,
for you know my deep Interest In it..
I am watching,. the progress of the
legislation with a great deal of
