WILSON WILL
GIVE PERMIT
TO CAR RAN Z A
Keply to Suggestion of Mex
ico's Executive to Be
Made Today.
PROPOSAL ACCEPTED
Indications Seem Favorable
to Plan of Reciprocal
Relations.
Washington, March 13. The
United States this afternoon ac
cepted (General Carranza's pro
posal for a reciprocal arrangement
by which either his troops or
American troops may pursue ban
dits on either side of the border.
A note of acceptance was sent for
ward to General Carranza at
Querctaro.
i'ho Mexican situation showed no
outward change today, with the
army steadily preparing to carry
ont President Wilson's orders to
pursue the Villa bandits.
General Carranza's proposal for a
reciprocal arrangement by which eith
er his forces or American troops may
pursue bandits on either side of the
line probably will be accepted by the
United States.
In practice it will have no effect be
cause American troops will be kept in
sufficient numbers on the border to
make incursions of Mexican troops un
necessary, but at the same time it will
avoid a controversy with General Car
ranza at this stage and allay agltallos
of an American invasion in Mexico.
The only congressional development
in the situation was a declaration in
the senate by Senator Borah that all
other legislation should be put aside
by congress and the national prepared
ness program taken up immediately to
meet any contingency to which the
sending of troops across the border
might lead.
The Vnited States will reply to Gen
eral Carranza's request for a recipro
cal arrangement for crossing of troops
at the Mexican border late today after
Secretary Lansing has conferred with
President Wilson. It was indicated
today that Carranza's proposal would
be accepted.
Hope to Clear Situation.
The acceptance probably will be
made on the ground that Carranza
troops may cross into American terri
tory in pursuit of bandits at any time
that American forces are not present
in sufficient numbers. It will be point
ed out that the inability of the Car
ranza troops to handle the situation
in northern Mexico is the sole ground
for entry of American soldiers. In
that way American officials expected
the situation will be relieved of its
chief menacing features. They ex
pressed the view today that a great
deal of unnecessary pessimism exists
as to General Carranza's attitude. As
to the attitude of the Mexican people
themselves, however, there is some
concern but it is realized that only
the developments of the next few days
can clear up that phase of the situa
tion. Hater fo Give Out ws.
Washington was in suspense early to
day awaiting official announcement
that American troopers were over the
Mexican border.
The war department was besieged
with inquiries. Newspaper men gath
ered about the door leading to Secre
tary Baker's office. The secretary said
he believed that the public was en
titled to know promptly what was be
ing done by the government to avenge
the Columbus massacre and he au
thorized the installation of special
equipment for the press in order that
the word might be flashed over the
country when it came.
While General Funston was assemb
ling his expedition "somewhere on the
border," three regiments of cavalry
and one of infantry were moving to
his support today from widely scat
tered points in the United States. The
cavalry was ordered out at his request
Saturday night, some from the Pacific
coast, some from the middle west and
Mme from the south. The infantry
regiment, the 23rd, now at Galveston,
has been under orders to be in readi
ness for several days. It will go to
El Paso and then be assigned by Gen
eral Funston to border duty.
Another Attack Feared.
Secretary Baker explained the move
ment of the 23rd by eaying that great
aprpehension was felt in many border
towns that the Columbus raid might
be repeated.
While strictest secrecy was main
tained by the war department, infor-

Troops Sent
to Rescue of
500Mormons
El Paso, March 13. Cavalry troops
have been dispatched from Laguna on
the line of the old Mexican Central
Railway north of Chihuahua City di
rect to Casas Grandes to aid the 500
members of the Mormon colony con
centrated at that point but now cut
off from communication with either
Chihuahua City or Juarez.
General Gavira, commandant at
Juarez received news of the new cav
alry movement from General Garza
this morning. It followed immediately
on the report of a scout train that
made a run down the Mexican and
Xorthwesern line in the direction of
Casas Grandes but turned back upon
seeing smoke ahead at Santa Sofia,
which seemed to come from a burning
bridge. Villa was last reported in the
neighborhood of Corralitos, not far
distant. Assuming that Villa's forces
were there the train returned.
Some months ago the bridges on the
section of the road between Madero
and Temosachic, below Casas Grandes,
were destroyed by Villa. As the tele
graph wires in Casas Grandes stopped
working suddenly last yesterday, as
if cut, the Mormons are now complete
ly isolated. But General Gavira says
his forces there are ample against
Villa.
THE WAR
TODAY
A prononnced pause has come in
the ;ermau offensive operations
against Verdun, so far as the in
fantry arm is concerned, accord
ing to the official bulletins from
Paris.
Paris passed without Infantry
advances and the crown prince's
troops did not leave their trenches
for an attack at any point during
the last night the French war of
fice reports. " '"
There has been no cessation of
the artillery play, however, the
bombardment continuing along
much of I lie front. It was particu
larly severe in the Woevre district
where the French guns have been
searching out hostile positions, in
dicating the probability that some
move by the Germans to the east
or southeast of the fortress on the
French right ilank is anticipated.
A small engagement occurred
In Le Pretrie forest, on the left
bank of the Moselle, west of Pont-A-Mousson,
to the east of the St.
Mihiel salient, where the French
report penetrating 200 yards of
trenches and withdrawing after
destroying the German saps.
French aviators bombarded the
railroad' station at Confians, w here
tires were seen to break out.
The artillery engagements on
both sides of the Meuse river from
the northwest of Verdun, along
the entire front to the southwest
of the fortress continue but in
fantry attacks have practically
ceased. The last infantry assault
reported, occurred on Satnrday,
when the Germans entered a
small French trench north of
Fix. In the lighting around Ver
dun thus far, the Germans claim
to have captured 26,472 unwouiid
ed French officers and men and
19 guns and 232 machine guns.
In Arabia, according to Con
stantinople, a British force trying
to advance inland from the Gulf
of Aden was driven back by the
Turks to the protection of the u
ships in the gulf.
The British Mesopotamlan force
under General Aylmer, suffered
casualties of 6,000 in the battle of
March 8 when it tried to advance
up the Tigris towards Kut-El-Amara
and was reported defeated
and obliged to retreat according to
an estimate by the Turkish war of
fice. In the Dniester region of East
Galicla the Russians claim to have
raptured a number of trenches
from the Germans and to have
taken the town of hirind from
the Turks in Persia.
A Kusslan torpedo boat destroy
er has been sunk in the Black sea
by a submarine of the central
powers.
The Italians are still prosecut
ing a vigorous campaign against
the Austro-Hungarlans and are
extensively bombarding the Ison
zo front.
The British fleet auxiliary Fan
vet te, a vessel of 2,044 tons, has
been sunk by striking a mine off
the east coast of England.
A Paris dispatch says that tes
timony given the Ameriran con
sul at Havre by the seven Amer
leans on board and the members
of the rew of the .Norwegian bark
tiillus, which was sunk off the
coast of France, is that the bark
was torpedoed by a submuriue
without warning.
DELAY START
OF HUNT FOR
RANDIT GANG
No Movement of Expedition
ary Force Is Probable To
day, Funston Says.
PLANS PROCEEDING
No Halt Made in Prepara
tion for Crossing Border
to Pursue Villa.
EI Faso. Tex, March IS. In
spite of official denials, reports
persisted here today that Ameri
can cavalry on the Arizona state
line had gathered for Immediate
crossing of the Mexican border and
that they might go across at any
moment today. An advance guard
of several cavalry troops was col
lected on that border two days ago
w ith the prospects that it might be
the first force Into Mexico.
The point where the cavalry ex
pedition Is reported gathering to
day to enter Mexico on the Arizona
boundary is near San Bernardino,
Mexico.
General Gabriel Gavira, command
ing the Carranza forces at Juarez,
came to Kl Paso this morning to hold
a conference with General Pershing in
command of Fort Bliss. General Ga
vira said the meeting would be held at
the Mexican consulate here.
General F"unston said today that the,
announcement of expedition's actual
start into Mexico, probably would come
from General Pershing to whom would
be left the decision as to the exact hour
for setting the movement afoot
Shortage of rolling stock, General
Funston said, was hindering the con
centration of cavalry at the base of
operations. The fault, he said, lay
with the railroads west of El Paso.
"We have even had to transport men
in box cars," he declared.
"When this movement is completed,
there will be only six or eight regi
ments left in the United States other
than those troops stationed along the
border for patrol duty."
There will be no infantry or cav
alry movements from Fort Sam Hous
ton for the present, it was announced
today.
The first aero squadron. Captain
Benjamin D. Foulols commanding,
went forward to El Paso this morning.
San Antonio, Tex., March 13 No
movement of the expeditionary force
which will search for Francisco Villa
is probable today, Major General Fred
erick FunBton announced this morn
ing. The general said preparations for
the cxpediton were going right ahead,
despite General Carranza's notifica
tion to the Washington government
that he would not consent to Ameri
can troops entering Mexico unless Car
ranza troops were allowed to enter the
United States.
It was officially announced that
Brigadier General John J. Pershing
will command the expeditonary forces.
General Funston said he had received
no notification from Washington to
hold back the expediton while negotia
tions were completed with General
Carranza. It is not believed though
that General Carranza's statement
would have great bearing on the situ
ation, in view of reports that Washing
ton would accede to the general's
wishes.
TURKEY TO SEEK
SEPARATE PEACE
Populace of Country Urging Sultan to
Institute Negotiations With
Entente Allies.
London, March 13, (9:50 a. m.) An
Athens dispatch to Reuter's Telegram
company says that, according to a
letter from Constantinople, the popu
lations of Brussa, Konieh and other
cities of Asia Minor have addressed
memorials to Prince Vahid Eddine, the
Turkish heir apparent, begging him to
urge upon the Sultan the necessity of
changing the present government, in
order to prepare the way for the con
clusion of a separate peace by Tur
key with the entente powers.

TRAITORS BLAMED
BY MEXICO PRESS
Official Paper Comments On Crisis
Expresses Faith In United
States Serenity.
Mexico City, March 13. The news
of the attack on Columbus by Villa
and his followers was first male pub
lic here yesterday morning when the
official organ, El Pueblo, published
the text of the note of the Mexican
government asking the government at
Washington to permit the passage of
Mexican soldiers into American ter
ritory, if such became necessary in
the pursuit of Villa, and, at the same
time granting to the United States the
reciprocity privilege of entering
Mexican territory for the same pur
pose. Under the caption, "The Columbus
Case Roguery of Natives and For
eigners," El Pueblo says editorially:
"The infamous and traitorous work
of reactionaries in the United States
has finally reached its most abhorrent
point. Because they were impotent to
stem the military and political
triumphs of constitutionalism, they
have tried to force armed intervention
by the United States in the affairs of
Mexico, in an endeavor to regain their
lost power.
"These enemies of civilization and
liberty conspire against the harmony
and peace that ought to prevail be
tween the two peoples, who, because
ol their inclinations, culture, ideals
and geographical position, are called
upon jointly to share the task of
working out the destinies of this west
ern hemisphere.
"The invitation of t:ie Mexican gov
ernment, founded, as it is in interna
tional practice, is the most efficient
means for satisfying public vengeance.
Wre are profoundly convinced that the
American government, maintaining
that serenity and judgment so nec
essary in these unhappy events, will
follow Its initial policy of respect to
ward the Mexican government and
will combine with it to take such ac
tion as circumstances warrant.
"In this way the misery of war thus
provoked by the criminal maneuvers
of the enemies of both governments
and both peoples will have been avert
ed. At any rate, we can assure the
whole world that Mexico will never
lose its International citizenship be
cause before that, it would prefer to
succumb gloriously in the rough sea
of a heroic struggle the supreme re
course of a people born never to be
slaves."
General Carranza arrived at Quere
taro Saturday night, to which town he
hurried with his cabinet from Guad
alajara. He will remain in the pro
visional capital until the crisis is past
MEASLES EPIDEMIC
IN NAVAL STATION
Chicago, March 13. An outbreak of
meaBles at the naval training station
at Newport, R. I., will necessitate the
removal of about 1,200 recruits from
there to the training station at Lake
Bluff, near here, according to Captain
W. N. Moffatt, - commandant, today.
This will mean an increase In the
number of recruits at the local station
to around 3,000, it was said.

DUNNE GOING TO

Governor on Way to Capital to Lay
Offer Before Wilson to Furnish
Troops for Expedition.
Chicago, 111., March 13. Governor
Dunne, who arrived here today, said
he expected to depart tomorrow for
Washington to lay before President
Wilson an offer to furnish Illinois'
state troops to the federal government
should the Mexican situation require
it. The governor will report that
eight regiments of infantry, one of
cavalry, one battery and three com
panies of naval reserves, all in readi
ness, can be mobilized in 48 hours.
The governor said the primary pur
pose of his trip was to discuss plans
for the Illinois waterway with the fed
eral war department but that if he
found that department overwhelmed
with work on the Mexican situation he
would defer such conferences until
later. The governor is to speak in
Philadelphia at a banquet Friday
night.

Net Earnings of Jfew York Corpora
tion for Fast Year Placed at
, $41417,487 Big Increase.
New York, March 13. An Increase
of more than $13,000,00 in the gross
earnings of the American Telephone
and Telegraph company last year
year over 1914 is shown by the annual
report of President Theodore N. Vail,
made public today. Total gross re
ceipts of the company, not including
the connecting independent compan
ies, last year were $239,900,000. The
company's net earnings were $41,117,-
4S7 and dividends amounted to $29,
100,591. The Bell system, President Vail
reports, now connects 9,151,221 tele
phones, a gain of half a million sta
tions in a year. It is estimated that
$57,000,000 will be spent in new con
struction this year. The company add
ed 1,029,951 miles to its system, mak
ing a total of 18,505,545 miles. An in
teresting feature of the report is that
substitutes for supplies used by the
company which previously were ob
tained abroad, have been provided by
the engineering department.
The report declares that the engi
neering department has done "import
ant and confidential" work with rep
resentatives of the army and navy to
work out a system of communication,
"unequalled by any other nation," in
connection with national defense
plans.
Regarding the suggestion of public
ownership, President Vail declared
there is little likelihood of this as
long as the present policies are fol
lowed. AMBASSADOR IS

Washington, March 13. Word has

W. Gerard at Berlin, authorizing him
to leave his post for a vacation. Sec
retary Lansing has had no word from
Mr. Gerard as to when the ambassador
will take his leave or where he will
spend it. It is considered not unlikely
however, that he may go to Switzer
land instead of coming home. The
ambassador recently sustained a pain
ful injury while participating in win

from its effects. State department of

London, March 13, (11:15 a. m.)
An Amsterdam dispatch to the Cen
tral News says that on account of tha
German offensive at Verdun tha
Dutch-Belgian frontier had been
closed for several weeks. That part
of it south of Maastricht has now
been reopened and this fact is com
mented on in Holland as probably In
dicating that the Germans consider
their offensive near an end. The dis
patch adds that 81 more hospital
trains with wounded Germans from
Verdun have passed through Luxenw
burg.
Paris, March 13, (2:32 p. m.) Thera
was no Infantry fighting last night In
the region of the north of Verdun, ac
cording to the announcement on tha
progress of hostilities made by tha
French war office this afternoon.
There has been, however, a continu
ance of the artillery activity along all
this front
German Losses Enormous.
The German losses in the fighting
around Fort Vaux last Friday and Sat
urday surpassed all previous records
in this war, according to officers who
have returned from Verdun. Time and
time again the Germans rushed from
their trenches only to melt away un
der the fire of the French. When tha
smoke and dust cleared nothing was to
be seen but heaps of bodies.
The spur on which the fort Is situ
ated is almost perpendicular in cer
tain places. The German lines wera
forced to halt but many Bavarian re
servists climed upon one another's
shoulders and struggled up the slope,
clinging to angles of rock and grasping
tufts of grass. Again and again thesa
human pyramids collapsed into shape
less gray masses. In the places where
the incline was easier and the attack
therefore more concentrated, tha
ditches below ran red with blood. At
the lowest estimate the attackers lost
two-thirds of their effectives.
The fighting also was desperate in
the extreme when regiments from the
15th and 18th German army corps at
tacked the village of Vaux on Friday.
Fight to Exhaustion.
It took four distinct assaults before
the first column of Germans won the
shelter of a small group of houses be
yond the church of Vaux. They then
organized an assault upon the church
and the French, being unable to bring
up reinforcements on account of the
German curtain of fire, withdrew their
advanced elements which were in dan
ger of being surrounded. Five times
the north Prussian regiments rushed
to attack the church but every time
they left the shelter of the ruined
houses they were beaten back. In the
meantime in their rear a curtain of
fire was kept up so that it was impos
sible for munitions and reinforcements
to be brought up for their benefit and
the fight died down on Friday night
from sheer exhaustion.
