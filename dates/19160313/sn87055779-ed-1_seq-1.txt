HOME. March F5. A new offen
sive movement by the Italians tho
first decisive result of the recent mil

over the greater part of the front in
the Austro-Italian theater of war.
On the Isonzo front the Italians
are bombarding Gorizia with massed
artillery.
In spite of inclement weather and
numerous avalanches in the moun
tains. Italian infantry is attacking
the Austrian positions at many
points, the war otlice states.
In some localities the snowslides
have been so great that cantonments
were buried, causing heavy loss of
life, and roads were blocked.
Near Oslavia the Italian attacks
were so violent that the Austro
Hungarians had to rush reinforce
ments to the front to save their bist
line of trenches.
The Italian offensive which as yet
is in its initial stages, is believed in
some quarters to have been part of
a grand scheme on the part of the
allies for a concentrated attack on
the German allies in the western,
eastern and southwestern theaters
of war. However, the Germans evi
dentlv learned of the plan and tried
to forestall it by attacking on tho
west front before the ri-rors of win
