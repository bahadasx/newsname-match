Friends of Special Police
man, Declare He Was
Tempted Into Drinking'
Special Policeman John Rooney of
287 Pequonnock street. will be arraign
ed before the board of police commis
sioners at their next meeting on the
charges of intoxication while on duty.'
At the "meeting, it is expected, -either
he or his friends will attempt to Bhow
that Rooney is a victim of a plot.
Following is the story told by one
of. Rooney's- friend:
"Rooney was always able to defend
himself even' in the . days of the mom
orable fights between the gangs known
as the "Whyos and the Tigers of East
Bridgeport. In those days, Jack
Rooney was a champion andS his
friends were many. The recent cru
sade' against'' improperly conducted
cabarets caused Manager Freyler to
produre the' services of a special po
liceman. He chose Rooney to act in
that capacity.- -"'
"A week agolast Saturday night,
shortly before midnight, four promi
nent young men of" this city became
boisterous in the Fairfield - cabaret,
and Rooney was called to quell the
impending disturbance. He had most
of the party ejected. One of them re
turned to) the cabaret and was telling
how he had licked cops from here to
Arizona and back again. He was sud
denly grahbed by the neck by Rooney
and hustled off to police headquarters
where he was charged with commit
ting a breach of the peace , and abu
sive language. The father of one of
the young men not arrested furnished
a bond of $100 for the release of the
prisoner. The flatter failed to appear
in 'city court the following morning
and the bond of JlOO was declared
forfeited. .. '.' . , ' ' ' "'
' -"The prisoner is an employe of the
Remington .Arms & Ammunition Co.
A . group of young men employed at
the Arms plant decided to get square
with Rooney. They visited the Fair
field cabaret last Monday night and
invited Special Policeman ; Rooneyto
h'aye a drink., , I ''..
"The . latter was 'oh ' the wagon'
however, and he refused. He,was
again approached at - 9 -o'clock and
again he refusedthe invitationA The
boys then wanted it Known that There
were no hard feelings between them
selves and Rooney. This wsts pleas

a few minutes conversation' in5 order
to set himself 'right . wKh the. ' boys'
Policeman Rooney accepted the invi
tation to have a few schooners in an
I alleyway adjoining Harry ( Quinn's
yfcafc. ' , i-
"As fast as Rooney could drink' the
gang" carried more from' the7' saloon.
He later accepted a f ew . gin rickeys
and pretty soon the special cop was
-unaer the weather.
Rooney was then led back" to the
cabaret, where ' he; was abandoned to
his fate. His condition was noticed
by patrons of the place and it is al
Ifeged that-. one of them telephoned
the matter to President John C. Stan
ley of the police board.
"It is said Stairtey visited , the cab
aret where he saw the condition of the
special- policeman. He ' denies the
story." . ; '
Freyler immediately . discharged
Rooney and the matter was reported
to Superintendent Eugene - Birming

ordered ah investigation of the case
which will be discussed at the meet

Washington, March" 13. The United
States will reply to General Carranza's
request for a reciprocal arrangement
for crossings of troops at the Mexican
border late today' after Secretary Lan
sing has conferred with President
Wilson. It was indicated that Car
ranza's proposal would be accepted.
The acceptance probably Vill be
made on the ground that Oarranza
troops may cross into American terri
tory in pursuit of bandits at any time
that--American forces! are not present
in sufficient numbers. It Vas pointed
out that the -inability of the Carranza
troops to handle, the situation in
northern Mexico is the sole ground for
entry of American soldiers, '
In that way American officials ex
petc the situation will be relieved of
its chief menacing feature. They ex-.
pressed the view today that a great
deal 'of unnecessary pessimism exists
as to General Carranza's, attitude. As
to the attitude of the Mexican, people
themselves, however, there is some
concern,- but it is realized that only
the developments of the next few days
can clear up that phase of the situa

FAVORS PLAN TO
PRUNE BOARD OF
EDUCATION TO T
Commissioner DeLoss To
Present Plan f or, Reorgan-A-
ization Tonigtit.
1 When the board of education meets
tonight it is likely that Harry H. De
Loss will present his plan for a pro
vision in the proposed commission
form of government charter that the
board may be continued but its per
sonnel be made smaller. Mr. Joetoss
who is chairman of the committee on
this matter has been hard at work on
it for a long time past. "He 'cannot
agree with John S. Pullman and other
members of the committee appointed
to draft a charter for commission
form of government, that tne board
of education should be abolished and
this department placed under the di
rection of one commissioners.
Mr. DeLoss was not ijeady today to
make known his views on the matter
but some time ago it was known he
favored retaining a, board of seven
members to handle educational mat
ters. He considers the' pre'sent board
of twelve members too unwieldy to be
practical. Itetely however Mr. De
Loss has come to the conclusion that
a board of five members would be
better able to handle school matters.
It is said that his report on this
matter and his plan would have been
forthcoming sooner but that President
Elmer H. Havens of the board had
not attended meetings which his com
mittee had held. Col. Havens is not
enthusiastic for commission govern
ment and he prefers to have the board
as it is with twelve members.
Commissioner DeLoss was elected
to the school board on the Citizens'
ticket last fall. Dr. C. C. Godfrey the
other member elected with him on
the Citizens" ticket is also a member
of the committee to make the special
charter provision .mentioned. Al
though the Citizens' party and its
candidates were supposed to stand for
commission form of government. Dr.
Godfrey is not in favor of the abolish
ment of the board of education but
believes it would be better to continue
the board as a separate commission
of five members.

of the frightened animal towards

There was a scampering of women
into available doorways, while a crowd

to the ambulance call.
Mayville, at the emergency hospital,
was treated for ' a lacerated left eye
and bruises about the body. When
picked up from the sidewalk where
he had been thrown from his over

ment of the- last few days, prepara

tion progressed today with regularity
and calm. ,
It is not expected here that the ex
pedition to enter Mexico at least from
this point, will be started for several
days because of the poor railroad fa
cilities with which to concentrate the
troops.
Meanwhile, Francisco Villa, with a
small body of men, it is reported here,
is fleeing further from the United
States border'daily and into the moun
tains which parallel the border of
Chihuahua and Sonora toward Guer
rera, where his career as an outlaw
began. Army men here point out
that once back in the mountains
among his friends the pursuit of Villa
is apt to-resemble a game of hide and

pursuit may be a matter of rrfonths.
