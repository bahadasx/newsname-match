FEAR UNITED, MEXICO
'GOOD MAN GONE WRONG'
The Tacoma Times and the Seattle Star sent Fred Boalt to Mexico in i 913 on the occasion of
the last Mexican embroglio. What he has to say now about the Villa situation cannot fail to be of
interest. -Editor.
By Fred L. Boalt.
During Ihe time when our govern
ment eras trying to make up Its mind
whether it would recognize Carran/.a or
Villa as the de facto head of the Mexi
can republic, my sympathies were all
with Villa.
I cannot claim to know Pancho Villa
well. But I have two close friends who
know Villa as well, I imagine, as it is
possible for Americans to know a Mexi
can.
These friends of mine arc Bill Shep
herd, United Press correspondent, and
Durborough, the Newspaper Enterprise
association's war photographer, both of
whom have since been covering the
European war.
1 first met Shepherd and Durborough
in Vera Cruz, during the American oc
cupation. 1 had come to Vera Cruz, at
the beginning of the occupation, from
the Rio Grande, where I had interviewed
Villa at Juarez.
Shepherd and Durborough had been
In Mexico longer than 1, and they had
campaigned with Villa In the north.
They had shared grub and blankets with
him.
Shepherd and Durborough believed in
Pancho Villa; believed, too, in his sin
cerity and ability to carry out the task
to which he had set his hand.
Because American soldiers are about
to cross the border, and take Villa —
dead or alive—and perhaps execute him
for the bandit and murderer he un
doubtedly Is, I want to tell again the
oft-told tale of this strange man.
I got It partly from the lips of Villa
himself, and partly from Shepherd and
Durborough.
Villa was a farmer In a small way,
a little above the peon class- He had
a little siter whom he loved, whose vir
gin beauty pleased the eye of the son
of a lord of the land whose great haci
enda was nearby.
The young aristocrat kidnaped Villa's
sister. Villa started in pursuit. On the
way he caught up with a priest whom
he compelled to accompany him.
They came upon the man and the
girl at evening as they were making
camp. At the point of a revolver Villa
forced tlie priest to marry the runaway
pearance of the family silver to impel the man
who "isn't afraid of robbers" to buy a bull dog.

er, has just sneaked up in the dead of night and

pair. He then made hi.s sister a widow.
You will conclude from this that Villa
was n luwles man, and so he was. Hut,
remember, there was, and is, no law in
Mexico for the protection of the class
I'roin which Piincho \ illn sprang.
Diaz was dictator. The father of the
murdered man had wealth and influ
ence. Diaz put a price on Villa's head.
Villa took to the mountains, gathered a
band about him, and turned bandit
chief.
Hut they will tell you In Mexico that
he was a Robin Hood of outlawry, rob
bing the rich and giving to tlie poor-
Diaz was driven out of Mexico.
Maderu, visionary nnd saint, horn
to martyrdom, rose to power. Villa
worshiped Madero. liloody Huerta
tricked Madero, and murdered him.
And then Villa came to Juarez, came
out of hiding—he and his band— to help
Carranza free Mexico und to restore the
laud to the people.
He came, a gorgeous bandit of melo
drama, from the mountains, wearing a
sombrero heavy with gold trimmings.
His picturesque bandit's costume tinkled
when he swaggered, so covered was it
with coins and trinkets.
His spurs were long- The heels
of his boots were high. In his belt
were stuffed knives and revolvers.
He was a savage.
But he soon saw that he was not like
the other leaders of the Constitutiona
lists. They, some of them, wore sack
coats and derby hats.
A smart man is Pancho Villa- One by
one he dropped his barbaric ornaments.
He wanted to be like other men.
When 1 saw him at Juarez, he wore a
business suit, he had a senographer and
a secretary, and he gave audience to the
newspaper reporters every morning at
10 o'clock!
One day DuThorough said to him:
"General, what Is It you are trying to
do "
And Villa answered: "I am trying to
get back the land, to split up the big
estates." And he told Durborough a
story.
"When Torreon fell," lie said, "I
thought to gi»•■ my men a concrete
Idea of what they had been fight-

ing for. So I gave them land.
They were tired of war. They be
gan building homes and tilling the
soil.
"But by and by 1 told them we must
go on fighting. 'Why?' they asked.
'You told us this war was to get back
the land. Well, we have it now. We
want to have farms, and homes, and
schools for our children.'
"1 told them there were millions ol
other Mexicans to the south. They, too,
must get land. We must keep on fight
ing if all our people are to have land.
"So, reluctantly, they quit their
farms, took up their rifles, nnd matched
away. I nearly lost my army by that
experiment."
Shepherd once put to Villa a some
what similar question: "General, why
are you a rebel?"
"When," said Villa, "I go to ■
Paso, and see there fine stores, and
women shopping, and men at work
al good jobs, ami children going to
school, and paved streets well
lighted; and when I then cross
hack over the bridge into Juarez,
nnd see nothing but ignorance, and
Illiteracy, and stupidity, and super
stition, mill degeneracy—when I
see the difference between El Paso
and Juarez, then I am a rebel!"
When our government was trying to
choose between Carranza and Villa, 1
was hoping they would choose the lat
ter. He had kept faith with us. Car
ranza had shown himself sulky and
tricky and offish.
We recognized Carranza, and perhaps
that was the best thing we could have
done for Mexico. But I think I can un
derstand Villa's disappointment and
subsequent hatred of us.
His batied must have changed
htm. Pet Imps he Is the man lie wan
when he came down from the
mountains. Perhaps he hstes
Americans now as he formerly hat
ed the land-owning aristocracy of
Mexico.
Well, he has gone too far. He must
be stopped and he must be punished.
But it Is a pity.

First, the government desires
Carranza's consent; and, second,
Gen. Funston Is holding his men
back until he is completely pre

Army officials predicted today
that V. K. troops will enter Mex

Misinformation given to the

accepted the terms of military
reciprocity.
This statement was withdrawn

The admlnlstratoln believes It

Fear Is expressed that should
