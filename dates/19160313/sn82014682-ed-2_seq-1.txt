"I Am. Waiting to Hear' From
Him," Says Mayor in Re-.
; . .sponse to Question; r
:i A' report today among close frl6nds
of Mayor ' Lane ' that the mayor, bad
cfferd : the-position "of Supervisory to
All "-the;pricspectlt'e SUtagle vacancy,
to Wallace - R. Farrington was con
firmed by the mayor early this after
noon. f';.' -:
Asked as to the .basis of the report,
which came from several - outside
sources; the mayor said : . i -.
"1 am nonr. waiting to hear from Mr.
Farrington. He is a good man the
kind of a man we would like to have
on the board. It's up to Mr. Ftfrrlng
ton and I am waiting bis pleasure." r
- Mr. Farrington would not comment
on the report other than to refer the
matter to the mayor. i
In city : hall circles today it . was
taken for granted that there is no
possibility that Walter F. Dillingham
will be found on the board when Sup
ervisor Shingle leaves. Whether or
not the otier was made to Mr. Dilling
ham is something about which neither
the mayor nor Mr. Dillingham, has' a
definite statement to make, but It is
said that Mr. Dillingham's pressing
business interests preclude the possl-,
bility of his being a prospective reci
pient of the honor. "
- Among the other supervisors there
is keen curiosity to hear who is likely
to be their new colleague. So far as
can be learned the mayor , has . not
confided his Intentions to any member
of the board..
TOBEAPPEALEI
r AsMcUUd Prut ty Tederal Wireless 1
LONDON, Eng.. March 13. The
court of appeals today handed down
a decision allowing appeal in the
Slingsby legitimacy suit.,,
This is one of the most noted cases
in legal . annals and. has been
fought out in American courts for the
Iast .'several years.- The case arose
over charges that another baby was
substituted for little "Teddy" Slingsby,
son cf LieuL and Mrs. C. R. Slingsby
and. heir to $500,000 property of the
Flingsby. family in Yorkshire, Eng
land. The substituuon was alleged to
have been made In San . Francisco.
The claim, was made that the real
Slingsby baby, which was "born in
San Francisco on September 1,1910,
died and that the mother substituted
another infant. : . . . ,r
After the case had been thrashed
out In San Francisco,-the evidence
was submitted to the probate court
in London, which on February 3, 1915,
decided that the ; present Slingsby
baby is legitimate and that no sub
stitution was. made. It is from this
decision that an appeal has now been
allowed. Sir Edward Carson, Union
ist leader and until recently a member
of the British coalition cabinet, has
been leading counsel for the contest
ant of the child's right to the estate.
