manifesto follows:
Text of Manifesto.
"Because of the assault which
Francisco Villa and the bandits who
accompanied him made on tho town
of Columbus In American territory,
burning houses and killing some of
the inhabitants, soldiers as well
civilians, tho international situation
In these moments is very delicate, as
the North American press have excit
ed their people against Mexico and
the government of that country hus
discussed the situation in tho Am
erican congress, members of which
have advised intervention.
"Tho constitutional government,
which I have the honor to represent,
is also occupied diligently in an effort
to solve this delicate situation, trying
at all costs to maintain the dignity
and sovereignty of Mexico and we yet
hope that this Tamentuble incident
may be decorously arranged and that
there will be no reason for an inter
national conflict.
IYcmlonts Are Cited.
"I have addressed the government
of the United States, through the
foreign office, stating that the inva
sion of Villa has historical precedents,
as in the years 1880 and 18S6 two
parties of Indians coming from the
United Stales invaded Sonora and
Chihuahua, committing crimes and
depredations on the lives and prop
erties of Mexicans.
"It was agreed between the govern
ments of the two countries to permit
the respective passage of armed force,
resulting in the extermination of the
Indians. I have aiked the American
government to pursue a like course in
order to solve future difficulties
tNhould they arise, noting that Villa,
and his companions are a group of j
handits whose acts the Mexican gov-J
ernment or people would not be re-.
sponsible for and that his reproiicha

the reactionary element, that, lacking

COMPLY Willi KEQIKST
Washington, March 12. General
Carranza's request for permission to
send Mexican troops Into American
territory to pursue bands who escape
across the border will be considered
by ITosident Wilson and Secretary
Lansing tomorrow.
It has been considered practically
certain that the reply would be to the
effect that American troops were
only being sent into Mexican territory
in pursuit of the Villa outlaws be
cause the de facto government of
Mexico did not have sufficient forces
on the scene to deal with the situa
tion and that whenever bandits should
cross into American territory where
there were not sufficient American
soldiers to take them into custody tho
right of entry would lie accord C'ar,
ramsa troops.
This, it Is believed, will be satis
factory to C'arranza und make it pos
sible for him to aequieese in the op
eration of American troops in north
ern Mexico without stirring up popu
lar resentment among his people
against him.

Osborne, American consul at Havre,
In his report to Washington on tho
sinking of the Norwegian bark Rilius,
says:
The seven Americans on the hark
were looking after a -cargo of oats
which was consigned to the French
government. Theso men and the
members of the crew have been ques
tioned by the consul, who has cabled
a summary of their testimony to
Washington. Their testimony, it Is
said, leaves no doubt that the Hilius
was torpedoed without warning". A
full report on the sinking of the ves

Four German submarines are re
ported to be in the Fngllsh channel
prepared to enforce rigidly Germany's
recently announced policy of naval
warfare.
The French press is engrossed with
the battle of Verdun and publishes
without comment the latest German
memorandum regarding submarine
warfare and the news of the sinking
of the Silins. The Temps, however,
remarks that, the torpedoing of the
Siliu.s cannot fail to reopen the entire
conflict between the United States
and Germany. Incidentally it re
marks that the incursion of Mexican
bandits into American territory bears
the stamp of German complicity.

Col. Herbert Slocum, commanding the
Thirteenth i aalry here, and of Major
Tompkins, to be allowed to renew the
pursuit Friday with a larger force
were denied pending the organisation
of the larger punitive expedition.
Setcral Days' Delay.
Today it was stateil that, this expedi
tion, owing to Inadequate rullro.ad fa
cilities, and the widely scattered posi
tion of the troops necessary lo consti
tute it, who have been on patrol duty,
might require several days' prepara
tion before it could enter Mexico, at
least from this point. Meanwhile re

Villa apparently was carrying out u
plan to elude pursuit by breaking up
his force into small bunds und hiding
among the mountains. Home of his
forces were reported to bo upprouch
ing the Sonora state border. Others
were said to be making their way
southward and southeastward today
toward the mountains of the San
Geronimo district, from which the
bandit chieftain started March 1 with
the announced intention of invading
the United States.
Reinforcements on Way.
General Slocum said ho hud been
advised that tho first squadron of the
Thirteenth cavalry also had been or
dered to rejoin tho regiment. The
Thirteenth, on account of its exploit
Thursday in beating off un over
whelming number of Mexicans after a!
