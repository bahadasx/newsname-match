Coming on special trains toward the
"war front" were regiments of In
fantry, artillery, cavalry, engineers
and forces of all the branches of the
army, either to take an active part
In the invasion of Mexico after Villa
or to replace the border troops sent
In to wipe out banditry.
The hour "to go in" was now ex
pected to arrive sometime Tuesday
although Maj. Gen. Fredk. Funston's
policy, of thorough preparedness and
'diplomatic negotiations with the defi
ant Carranzistas may further delay
the expedition.
Carranza's threatened armed oppo
sition to the entry of American
troops and Villa's flight toward the
defenseless American Mormon colo
nists in Chihuahua has torn the bor
der country between feelings of
anger and fear. The problem of seis
ing all the northern Mexican railways
and preparing to fight both Carran
zistas and Vlllistas was now before
the army heads.
Carranzlsta officers were reported
to be having trouble suppressing a
mutinous spirit among their soldiers.
Anti-American demonstrations were
reported from several Mexican points.
U. S. Consul Marlon Letcher at Chi
huahua City was arranging for the
speedy transportation of the fifty
American families there to the bor
der. Six American residents of El
Paso arrrivlng from Chihuahua City
stated their lives were threatened by
two Carranzlsta officers.
Hang All Gringoes.
"We're going to take all you grin
goes out and bang you," one Car
ranzlsta said. Villa was last reported
marching southward from Corvalitos
toward San Buena Ventura, near the
Mormon colonies. He was either de
termined to carry out his threat to
annihilate all the 600 American men,
women and children, or was fleeing
to the mountainous Guerrero district
to hide from the American pursuit.
Villa Is believed to have divided
his followers Into small guerilla
bands. Villlstas even were reported
in the northern part of Durango state
where a band under General Urbalejo
made an unsuccessful attack on a
passenger train on the Naltonal lines
of Mexico, killing a number of the
crew. An armed Carranzlsta guard
drove off the bandits after they had
dynamited the station at Conejos.
B1 Paso had Its first opportunity
to display its war spirit last night.
The remainder of the Twentieth u.
S. infantry, about 700 men, passed
through the city on an El Paso and
Southwestern train bound for "some
where on the border."
The first intimation the citizens had
of their departure were the soldiers"
wild cheers. They were haopy over
the prospect of some action.
Thousands of men, women and chil
dren rushed toward the long train,
answering cheer for cheer.

1R1L SPIRIT ALONG THE BORDER
Carranza's Men May Turn Against United
States and Serious Trouble Arise
Within a Few Days.
[By H. D. Jacobs, United Press Staff
Correspondent.
EL PASO, Texas, March 13.—
Threatened with war by an aroused
Mexico, Uncle Sam's expedition to
avenge the Columbus raid was still
held in leash along the border today.
Carried away by the martial spirit,
scores of excited civilians shrieked
to the soldiers, "give the greasers
hell."
Apprehensive that the depletion of
the Fort Bliss garrison may encour
age the twenty thousand Mexicans in
the city to attack El Paso, hundreds
of American residents are going
armed. Brig. Gen. J. J. Pershing, in
command at Fort Bliss, has given the
authorities assurances that the city
will be protected. Deputy sheriffs
with automatic rifles have been sworn
In.
The reported mutinous spirit of ihe
Carranzlsta garrison at Juarez also
aroused apprehension.
A former Carranzlsta official said
today that all Mexico would rise
against the American invader?.
The Carranzistas hate the Villlstas,
but Mexicans hate Americans inure,
be said.
Even if Carranza mad* some recip
rocal arrangement for Carranzlsta'
troops to pursue bandits into the XT.
S. this official stated, the defacto gov
ernment would be unable to control
Its soldiers if the American armed
soldiers entered Mexico.
The First Blood.
The Carranzlsta even expressed be
lief that the first American blood
spilled might not be by Vllllsta, but
by Carranza soldiers opposing Invas
ion as the initial expedition sweeps
into Juarez to take over the Mexican
railways.
He feared that if this happened,
the friendly Invasion" would cease
to be a fact and with a rebellion on
their hands the Americans would be
compelled to conquer most of Mexico
instead of merely taking Villa dead
or alive.
No co-operation was displayed to
day by the defacto Mexican forces
across the morder. By working -to-
gether, fewer men would bo needed
and the extermination of Villa would
be accomplished much more quickly.
However, the American army officials
feel a strong contempt for the mili
tary abilities of the Carranzistas.
If co-operation is arranged and the
Mexican people do not rise against
the American soldiers, the biggest
man hunt in history will open with
the movement across the border. Re
doubling their efforts to capture Villa
themselves and thus render the Amer
ican invasion unnecessary, the de
facto government is reported to have
2,500 men closing in on Corralltos.
Uwo thousand more Just arrived at
Juarez and will be sent to Palomas.
Twelve thousand American troops
are mobilizing on the border to enter
the iila hunt.
This makes a total of 16,500 trained
soldiers after one man.
While Villa has a force variously
estimated at 300 to 4,000, he alone is
believed to be the object of the Amer
ican expedition and with him killed
or captured, their work will be con
sidered practically accomplished.
The American mobilization was
shouded in mystery behind an official
censorship today. Soldiers were
ignorant of their destination. Crews
of troop trains were working under

WASHINGTON, March Id.—Presi

Colonel House shortly after his re

before the president Germany's ten
tative proposals as modlfled by recent
months of warfare. Colonel House
did not go to Berlin to discuss pos
sible peace terms, but it is said he
did receive an outline of the German
view of a proper settlement following
the end of the war.
The terms Germany would consider,
confirmed by high German authority
hero, provide:
That German colonies taken by the
entente allies be returned to Ger
many.
That no indemnities be demanded
by either side.
That Montenegro, Serbia and Al
bania be divided between Austria,
Bulgaria and Greece.
-hat an autonomous government be
established In Poland.
That Turkey be entirely freed of
British influences.
That Germany return Belgium and
those portions of French territory
now in possession of the kaiser's
army.
That England remain as she now
is, neither giving nor receiving any
thing.
