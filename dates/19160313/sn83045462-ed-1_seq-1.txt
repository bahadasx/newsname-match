Repeal of Free Sugar Clause
in Tariff Act.
J
Representative norlands new
rider, reducing by 10% tlic c
clerical force in tlic executive
branches of the federal government
as well as the similar force
in the District government, probably
will come to a vote tomorrow
afternoon, and members of
the appropriations committee to-:
dav predict a three-to-one defeat
for it. The fact that the new Bor-1 .
land rider asks for a direct saving
in the number of clerk.-, as well |
as placing an uncompensated |
hour on their workday, is expect-1
ed to bring it within the llolman j
rule. However, as one member
expressed it today:
"The Holman rule would permit
us to cut the President's salary
in two?but it wouldn't have
a chance when it came to a vote."
Members Hearing From Home.
.\ point of order already has been
made against the rider by Representa- ^j.
tive Mondell. who was responsible for *
stabbing the original rider with a Jill
sharply pointed parliamentary weapon
Saturday. However ridiculous may be
the proposal suddenly to reduce the ^1
government's forces by one-tenth and jjjj
add one-seventh to the labors of those " .
remaining, it is possible that it will re- I
main in the bill until a vote can be T
asked for. On this point, too. it may be !>ec
welcome news to learn that many con- tab
gressrnen are hearing from home, it h
was said today, and they find that they
an cast a vote against the Borland
injustice with considerable applause leai
from their own home folks. ji
One thing: which the agitation on the
Borland rider has done is to put the bor
appropriation committee on its guard che
against further similar Impositions. ^
The committee now is in the position
of having brought in a bill with an *un
important legislative provision only to def<
have the House expose the fact that it the
was thrown into the bill at the last
minute without previous thought or
scientific study. Representative Austin tal<
of Tennessee brought that fact to light cou
very clearly. . .

Members of the appropriations committee
have recalled the fact that the *ier
Borland street paving rider was tacked h'n
on an appropriation bill without any tioi
previous study, also.
Although Representative Borland is a ^'n
member of the appropriations committee.
.f he continues his membership for an- er?
other t'ongress there will be a sharp Kra
lookout kept for "jokers" which cannot ba\
be defended on the floor, and which are of
more important as political weapons
than as constructive measures.
The legislative appropriation bill proba- Pr':
b|\ will be the order of business tomor- cha

LONDON. March 13.?A pronounced
pause has come in the
1 iennan offensive operations
against Verdun as far as the 111fantrv
arm is concerned, according
to the official bulletins from
I'aris.
Sunday passed without infantry
advances, and tiie crown

point during last night, the
French war office reports.
Artillery Duel Keeps Dp.
There has been no cessation of the
artillery play, however, the bombardment
continuing: along: much of the
front. It was particularly severe in the
Woevre district, where the French
guns have been searching out hostile
positions, indicating the probability
that some move by the Germans to the
east or southeast of the fortress on
the French right flank, is anticipated.
A small engagement occurred in I.e
I'retre forest, on the left bank of the
Moselle, west of Pont-a-Mousson, to the
east of the St. Mihiel salient, where
the French report penetrating -vu
yards of trenches and withdrawing

station at Conflans, where fires
were seen to break out.
Reports come from Dutch sources
that the Dutch-Belgian frontier, which
has been closed for several weeks coincident
with the Verdun offensive, has
been reopened at one point. Th.s is
commented on in Holland, according to
a news agency dispatch through I-on don,
as probably indicating that the
Germans consider their offensive near
an end.
Infantry Fighting Suspended.
i PARIS, March 13, 2:30 p.m.?The official
statement today by the war office
says:
"There was no infantry fighting last
J night in the region to the north of Verdun.
The bombardment continued, however.
during the night at Bethincourt.
and in the vicinity of Douaumont, as
well as in the Woevre, in the sectors of

and after having inflicted some losses
on the enemy they returned to our
lines with about twenty prisoners.
"The night passed quietly on the remainder

Cut Off at Source.
MONTEREY. Cal., March 13.?The
headquarters building: of the Monterey
presidio was totally destroyed by fire
early today, about six hours after being
vacated by troops of the 1st Cavalry,
who left for the Mexican border. Firemen
attempting to extinguish the flames
found that the water supply had been
[ shut off at the source.
Investigation Ordered.
An investigation was started immediately.
Monterey was the Spanish and
Mexican capital of California, and the
presidio occupies the site of the ancient
military headquarters. The post consisted
of old wooden barracks sufficient
to accommodate a regiment. These
were of the type common at the presidio
of San Francisco, where several
persons, including the wife and three
daughters of Brig. Gen. .John J. J'ershing,
were burned to death.

The headquarters safe and contents of
the post office were saved; all other records
were destroyed. Maj. James G. Harboard,
in charge of the post, refused to

II In order to correct a published report
3 that he is opposed to the Boy Scout 1
movement, Secretary Baker has ex- j
_ plained his position as follows: t
"The statement that 1 am opposed to '
. the Boy Scout movement is perhaps
t due to a misunderstanding. There are
. two Boy Scout organizations. One of
n them is a general scout movement and
n the other is known as the Boy Scouts
e of America.
"The latter organization T was asked
a some time ago to join as a member of
J the board of governors and 1 was sent
a letter which stated the object of this
K society was to make of America a mili?
tary nation. I replied to that letter
n stating that i was not in sympathy
wltn a movement to make this country
a military nation.
"I think the Boy Scout movement is
one of tne finest ever started. I am very
anxious to have my own boy attain the
e age when he can become a scout. Its
o general activities are fine, teaching, as *
they do. manliness, courage, trutbfulI

It was officially announced tha
Brig. Gen. John J. Pershing will com

Gen. Funston said he had* receive*

for setting the movement afoot.
Shortage of rolling stock. Gen. Funston
said, was hindering the concentra
tion of cavalry at the base of operations.
and this was one reason why i
movement today was unlikely. Th?
fault, he said, lay with the railroad!
west of El Paso.
"We have even had to transport mer

been merely an infantry expedition w<
could have been into Mexico on Villa'!

Size of the Expeditionary Force.
Light was thrown on the size of th?
expeditionary force by the general
who said:
"When this movement is complete*
there will be only^six or eight regiments
left in the United States othei

J Confers With Senate Leaders.
r Senator* Stone and Sautabury of the
. (Senate committee on foreign relations
V | were at the White House before the ? e
1 rival of Mr. lousing and conferred with
j the President for half an hour. They did
not deny that they had talked with the
T President about an agreement such as is
wanted by Carranza.
Senator Stone explained that there is no
treaty between the United States and
Mexico covering the present situation. It.
is taken for granted that the President
1 has indicated that he is willing to oblige
- Gen. Carranza in the matter of reciprocal
rights such as he asks for and that the
President wished to take the Senate for*
eighn relations committee into his confi)
dence 011 the subject.
It is said that the President believes he
can make a reciprocal arrangement for
' the pursuit of bandits in Mexico without
the consent cf the Senate. He has under
consideration one proposal from a me Tiber
of his cabinet that a zone forty mile*
1 wide be established along the bouti l;.t\.
B between Mexico and the United States, in
j which authorities of both nations would
e 1 have the right to pursue outlaws
r
Nothing: for Congress to Do.
When Senator Stone reached the Capl
tol after his conference with the President
he found the temper of Congress
? with respect to the Mexican situation
s "equable and good."
"There is nothing to he done by Coni
gress with respect to the situation that
; I know of at this time," said Senator
I Stone. "I think that the executive has
. power to make a reciprocal agreement
? with the de facto government of Mexico
regarding soldiers crossing the border
without submitting the matter to Congress.
| "To submit it to Congress would
*' j mean weeks of discussion, in my opin,
| ion. and action would have to wait,
j "What is contemplated now?the pur
| suit and capture of lawless men?is
l not war unless some one wants to make
it war or an excuse for war. In such &
" contingency, of course, the whole mati
ter would be submitted to Congress."
Some Objections Are Raised.
Some members of the Senate feel
. very strongly that the President should
not yield to the request of Carranza
for the privilege of sending Mexican
troops into United States territory tQ
chase bandits. They insist that Carj
ranza does not really represent Mexico,
, i that he is himself practically a pris,
oner and that conditions existing in
" j Mexico ' make the request also ridicu
lous.
Others also maintain that the Presii
{ dent has no constitutional right to
' make such an agreement without first
negotiating a treaty which should I**
ratified by the Senate. On the other
hand one senator said today:
: "Ordinarily I would not be willing to
waive a question of which the constitutionality
is in doubt, but I am so
anxious that President Wilson shall
Ret into Mexico, and Ret so far in that
he won't be able to come out. that I believe
I would be willing- to let such an
arrangement as proposed gp by without
opposition."
Expect No Senate Opposition.
| It is said to be likely that no ar!
rangement of a temporary nature with

! It is likely, it is believed, that the
j United States will reply to ('ananza's
' request for a reciprocal arrangement
'late tortav. following the conference
between the President and Secretary
Lansing. One report has it that the ac-centatice
could be based on the ground
that ''arranza troops may cross into
American, territory in pursuit of bandits
