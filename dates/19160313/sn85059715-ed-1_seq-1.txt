in cut of the expeditionary force that
will search for Francisco Villa is
probable today, Major General Funs*
^ ion announced today.
The general said preparations for;
the expedition were going on despitej
General Carranza's notlUcatlon to the
Washington government that lie would
not consent io American troops enter-;
lug Mexico nnless Carranza troops!
were allowed to enter the United >
states.
It was officially announced that;
Brigadier General John J. Pershing:
will command the ex|ieditionary forces.'
General Funston said he had re* j
celved no iiotltlcation from Washington
to hold back the expedition while negotiations
were being completed witli
General Garranxa.

COLUMBUS, N. M., March 13?
Actual concentration of United States
troops for an expedition Into Mexico
to try to capture Francisco Villa
was begun here today.
From the heavy troop movements
to Columbus It would seem, accord4
n or tn nfh^Ara atnilnnaH Sapa fhat
this point is to be made a base of operations.
The force of- General Pablo Bergani,
commanding the Carranza garrison
at Palomas on the Mextcan
side of the border south of here, was
increased today by the arrival of 800
men bringing his forces to a total of
2,000 men. By tonight it is expected !
that the American garrison here of'
3,100 men will be augmented by the'
arrival of two regiments of infantry,
I a signal company, a hospital detach-'
ment and some mountain artillery
from Fort Bliss at ?1 Paso, and a
battery of the Sixth field artillery
from Nogales, Arlx. Two squadrons
or the Twelfth cavalry from Fort
Itoblnson, Neb., are expected later.
All save the cavalry from Fort Robinson.
which is to go on station here, >
Hre apparently to be available for
expeditionary purposes.
The battery of mountain artillery
from Fort Bliss is equipped with
twelve mountain guns especially designed
for the .character of fighting!
which the punitive expedition ia expected
to do. Two troops of the j
Thirteenth cavalry, F and H, which :
have been on patrol duty at Hermanns,
twenty miles west of here, also
have returned to camp preparatory i
to the despatching of an expedition.;
Troop G, which had been doing duty;
at Border Gates, two and one-half;
miles south, also was returned, ^eing
replaced by a company of Infantry.
In striking contrast to the excitement
of the last few days, preparation
for the departure of the exedition
progressed today with regularity
and calm.
- - i ? - ? it. . ?
It Is not expected nere mat toe expedition
to'enter Mexico at leaet from
tills point will be started for several
days because of the poor railroad facilities
with which to concentrate the
troops.
Meanwhile Villa, with but a smgll.
body of men, It is reported here, is
fleeing farther from the United States
border dally into the mountains
which parallel the border of Chihuahua
at Sonora towards Guerrero,
where his days as an outlaw began,
and whero to almost every peon
"Paneh" Villa is a hero. Army
men here point out that once back
in the mountains among his friends,
the pursuit of Villa is apt to resemble
a game of hide and seek. Some
J ofllcers believe that the pursuit may
be a matter of months.

his ambition had been to own a newspaper

He had but one Republican colleague.
