LANSING ASKS DATA

Seeks Information Concerning Loss
of Vessel on Which Amer
icans Were Aboard.
TORPEDOED WITHOUT NOTICE
WASHINGTON, March 11. Secre
tary Lansing today Instructed Consul
Osborne at Havre, France, to se
cure and forward Immediately all
available details of the sinking in
Havre roads of the Norwegian bark
Slllus, from which seven American
citizens were rescued. Consul Os
borne had previously reported that
the Slllus was torpedoed without
.warning wvthe nlght.o:March 8,.'. . -If
a torpedo did destroy the bark,
which was bound to Havre from
New York with grain, the govern
ment responsible will be beld to
strict accountability. Such an act
would be contrary to all the assur
ances which the United States has
secured.
Withholding; Judgment.
Officials seemed inclined, how-
ever to refrain from forming an
opinion until It was known posi
tively that a torpedo and not a mine
sunk the ship.
Should Consul Osborne's investigation
establish that a torpedo actually was re
sponsible, the United States officials in
dlcated they will view the matter as
even more aerloua than if a passenger
carrying vessel was involved. The State
department considers that American sea'
men have even a greater claim to pro
tection than passengers. A passenger
travels at his discretion, while a seaman
ia compiled to do so by his occupation.

Idea of Americans
On Mexican Ground
Galling to Natives
EL PASO, Tex., March 12. First Chief
Carranza's attitude toward the United
States as a result of Villa's brigandage is
unknown to General Gavlra, the com
mandant at Juarez. General Gavlra
stated to the Associated Press tonight
that he had not received a word from
the Mexican government relative to the
crisis, but added that General Luis
Gutierrez, nominal head of the state of
Chihuahua, would arrive at Juarez on a
special train tomorrow for a conference.
In reply to the question as to whether
General Pershing would be a party to
the meeting the general answered no;
that the conference was entirely per
sonal. He was quick to deny the report
that' the Mexican populace took a hostile
view of President Wilson's position.
"I have the greatest faith In Mr. Wil
son's disinterestedness and" friendly" mo
tives." he said, f'and I am quite as posi
tive that General Gutierrez shares my
view. We shall be glad to co-operate
with the United States."
Inquiries' among well-informed Mexi
cans In Juarez showed that the idea of
American troops on Mexican soil la not
altogether welcome. One Mexican In an
official position spoke guardedly of the
affair, but expressed his real feelings in
this form)
"We are now placing large forces in
the field against Villa, and I hope we can
dispose tf him before the North AmerT
can troops cross the border. It would
be much better from the Mexicans' view
point to let us finish him ourselves. Then
there would be no possibility of any
clashes or misunderstandings."

In El Paso some apprehension was
aroused among the authorities by the
large number of Mexicans crossing over
Into Texas, but an Investigation showed
that they came to get out of the range of
any conflict. . Many declared they had
seen much of war.
Rumors concerning Villa receiving
agents operating In Juarez have not stood
the test of Inquiry. The leading news
papers In Spanish keep off The Invasion
question In their editorials, but several
small sheets that are said to break out
whenever a crisis occurs hava been taken
In hand by the police.
Although the border Is closely patrolled
by the Americans, the main object is to
catch any contraband that may be pass

army of Mexico is given every facility In
the way of obtaining supplies and Gen

Report multiplied here today that
Francisco Villa is disintegrating the
force of 1,500 to 2,500 men whom he
used to support or to mak e the
Columbus raid Inst Thursday.
American military authorities said
today that if possible It would have
been advisable to go after Villa
Thursday when bla raiders feld
southward. They were then demor
alized and were dropping loot and
war material before the attacks of
fifty-nine men under Major Frank
Tompkins. Requests of Colonel Her

teenth cavalry here, and of Tomp
kins to be allowed to renew the pur
suit Friday with a larger force were
denied pending the organization of
the large punitive expedition.

Today It waa stated that thla expedition,
owing to Inadequate railroad facilities,
and the widely m attered position of t'ia
troops necessary to constitute It, who
have been on patrol duty, might require
several days', preparation before It could
enter Mexico, at least from this point.
Meanwhile reports from ' Mexican
sources stated that Villa apparently waa

of his forces were reported to be ap

Information was received here today
that two regiments of Infantry and a
battalion of mountain artillery were be

to a battery of the Blxth artillery from
Nogalea, Arts, ' and a signal company.
Colonel Blocum said he had been ad
vleed that the first squadron of the Thir

rejoin the regiment. The Thirteenth, on
account of Its exploit Thursday in beat
ing off . an overwhelming number of
Mexicans after a stiff fight in which they
Indicted possibly fifteen times the num
ber of their own casualties, la said to
have been assigned to the duty of taking
Villa's direct trail.
But owing to the exigencies of the
patrol duty to which the army has been
assigned ever since the outbreak of the
Madero revolution, the regiment has had
on duty here only two-thirds of Its
strength.
Tho first squadron, under Lieutenant
Colonel Trlvers, haa been stationed at
Marfa, Tex., more than 250 miles east of
