The Germans are still carrying on
strong offensive operations northeast
and northwest of Vf .dun. About four
' and one-half miles northeast of the
fortress they penetrated the Caillette
Wood, just outside Fort Douaumont,
after a violent bombardment. From
part of this wood the French in an

bombardments; artillery duels have
characterized the fighting along the re

around Verdun. The French brought
down three Rerman machines, but
Berlin asserts that the aerial com

sides have been busily engaged in
dropping bombs on military establish

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATION
OF HIGH PRICE OF GASOLINE
Agencies Will Report Findings
to
Congress This Week.
vv ashmgton, March 2. Government
agencies investigating the spectacular
rise in the price of gasoline have vir
tually concluded preliminary phases of
tneir work ana will report to congress
tnis week. in tne meantime the de
partment of justice, which has kept
in cicse touch wth the situation, will
consider the evidence with a view to
determining whether prosecutions are
warranted under the anti-trust law.
Every available field agent of the fed
erai trade commission nas Deen as
signed to the gasoline inquiry under
the Direction of commissioner w.
Harris. Reports by the various com
mittees involved have been checked, so
iar as possiDie. crude oil producers,
manufacturing companies, pipe lines,
selling agencies, even tank wagons in
every section of the country have been
under surveillance. A tremendous
mass of data has resulted, bearing on
all phases of the industry. Essential
of this information have been placed
before the attorney-general as fast as
gathered.
The department of justice virtually
left the entire inquiry to the commis
sion. Complaints received by the at
torney general have been forwarded
for investigation to the commission
and have been added to hundreds of
similar complaints received by the
crmmisslon itself. It is considered un
likely that the attorney general will
decide finally whether the evidence
war-ints prosecutions until the com
mission shall have concluded its in
quiry, a month or more hence.

WOULD REVOLUTIONIZE
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
Plan of Education Board Founded by
John D. Rockefeller.
New York, April 2. The general ed-
cation board founded by John D.
Rockerfeler, today invited expressions
of opinion as to the feasibility of es
tablishing a modern school which, ac
cording to Abraham Flexner, assistant
secretary of the board when submitted
the plan, would revolutionize the pres
ent educational system.
In announcing the proposed innova
tion, which not only would change the
curriculum now in vogue in schools
and colleges, but would attempt to
utilize as its laboratory "the accessi
ble world" the general education board
declared its sole Interest was "to facil
itate the trial of promising educa
tional experiments under proper con
ditions." "The curriculum, Mr. Flexner said,
includes nothing for which an af
firmative case cannot be made now.
The modern school would drop the
study of formal grammar: for such
evidence as we possess points to the
futility of formal grammar as an aid
to correct speaking and writing.
A modern school would not go
through the form of teaching children
useless historic facts just because pre
vious generations of children have
learned and forgotten them: and al
so would have the courage not to read
obsolete and uncongenial classics, sim
ply oeeause tradition has made this
sort of acquaintance a kind of good
form."
Neither Latin nor Greek, Mr. Flex
ner adds, would be contained in the
curriculum of the modern school.
Not because their literatures are less
wonderful than they rae reputed to be,
but because their present position in
the curriculum rests upon tradition
and assumption.
'Aside from reading,, writ Id, spell
ing and figuring, the curriculum of the
modem school would be built out of
actual activities in science, industry
aesthetics and civics. The work in
science would be the central and dom
inating feature.
A school trying to produce a re
sourceful modern type of educated
man and woman would pre Ido prac
ticai training in one or more mod
ern language."
ICELAND HAS BEEN
ENRICHED BY THE WAR
Fortunes Made by the Exportation of
Fish, Game, Wool and Hides.
Copenhagen. April 2. Iceland was
one T the poorest countries in the
world before the war, but it has made
great wealth during tiv past vear.
Most pt the fortunes have been made
by merchants exporting fish, game,
wool and hides to England. Such un
precedented sums have been deposited
in the banks of Reikjavik that bank
ers do not know how to invest their
capital.
Iceland has imported great quant
tie3 of American goods during the
war, but these have come through oth
er countries. Icelanders now want di
rect steamship communication with
the United States to promote recipro
cal trade. Plans have been made for
a steamship service between Reikja
vlk anfi Boston, and sailings are ex
pected soon. Icelandic business inter
ests are anxious for the appointment
of a regular salaried United States
consul. Great Britain and France are
the only governments at present rep
resented in Iceland by salaried con
suls. AWAITING GERMANY'S REPLY
ABOUT SUNKEN SHIPS.
Possibly It Will Be Hero in Tim for
Cabinst Meeting Tomorrow.
Washington, April 2. Official judg
ment still is suspended here on the
cases of the British channel steamer
Sussex and other merchant ships
wrhich, while carrying American citi
zens, recently have met with disaster
in the war zone. Secretary Lansing
said tonight that no additional infor
mation had been received. The state
department received from Embassador
Gerard the reply of the German gov
renment to the inquiry he made In
regard to the Sussex, the Manchester
Engineer and the Englishman. Mr.
Gerard informed the department ves-
terday.that the Berap government was
making an investigation and that toe
would be advised of the results upon
its completion.
All the evidence bearing on the dis
asters independent of that which may
come from Berlin is expected to be in
the hands of the department some time
this week, however, possibly in time
for Tuesday's cabinet meeting. -This
evidence will be examined very care
fully to determine whether it forms
sufficient ground for action by the
United States.
