British Foreign Office says There Is

LONDON. April 3. The British
foreign office informed the United
Press today that there Is no founda
tion for the rumor chat Holland's
warlike preparations are due to an
allied threat of violating Dutch neu
trality. It was denied that the summoning
of the Dutch parliament and the can

any decision of the allied military
conference at Paris. The Dutch
minister of war hinted that some
power suggested that Holland demo

that Holland "must prepare to resist
vigorously any danger at any minute.
We must prepare to use our whole
force at a moment's notice against
violators of our neutrality. We bays
decided to reject tne suggestion to
