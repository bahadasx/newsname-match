Congressman Butler, Grilling
Daniels, Says Russia and
Germany Learned Plans.
SECRETARY MAKES DENIAL
Tells Committee He Knows
Nothing of Assertions Put
Through Severe Quiz.
Accusing his administration of
having furnished specifications and
intimate details of the 14-inch guns,
armor strength, and other offensive
and defensive parts of the United
States to other governments, "big
navy" members of the House Navai
Committee today subjected becre
tary Daniels to a grilling cross-
examination.
Congressman Butler of Pcnnsyl
vania charged that the navy's plans
and specifications had fallen ino
the hands of the Russian govern
ment and the Krupp people under
Daniels' administration.
Daniels denied any knowledge of
the charges.
DENIAL BY DANIELS.
"Do ou remember having turned
over to the nusslan government tho de
signs and specifications of our H-lnch
guns, armor, nnd other naval efTects
during our Administration?" Butler
asked.
"I do not." Dnnlels replied.
"If that was done, you would say It
was wrong?" Dutlcr asked.
"Absolutely," Daniels retorted.
"Thon you know nothing otMhe foct
that the designs and pvclflcaCfOna wTve
furnished the Rusrlan government
under your administration?" Butler In
sisted. , .
"I know nothing of it," Daniels ro
plled. "Will you nsk Admiral Strauss for a
copy of tho letter sent to tho Krupp
Company in Germany sto wo v. Ill know
whether the specifications of our 14
lnch guns wero given to the German
government'" Butler asked.
Will Ask For Letter.
Daniels said lie would ask for the
letters.
"You would say that if tho fact Is
shown that these specifications were
jriven to tho Krupp people. It w as
wrong?" Butler continued.
"Absolutely." Daniels reiterated.
Daniels urged passugo of the armor
plate bill without amendment, opposing
an amendment proposed hv Butler that
the prlvato armor manufacturers should
be given contracts in case they would
bid a price satisfactory to the Secictary
of tho Navy.
"I know It would bo a costly experi
ment, ' Daniels said. "I know these
armor plate manufacturers would not
prdfluce armor at any price wtlhout a
large profit. I would not give to any
Secretary the power to deal with mo
nopolies. "It must be a public transaction. The
rule(ot tho Secretary under your amend
ment will bo Ilnal.
Entirely Unsatisfactory.
"A price that might be satisfactory
to ono Secretary probably would not be
to another. Tho whole proposition for
private contract for armor plate manu
facture Is unsatisfactory to me.
"I would not be satisfied with the
death bed repontance of corporations
that havo been charging exorbitant
prices."
Daniels said the armor plate delivery
had been prompt and the quality satis
factory, tho only objection being tho
price.
Admiral Strauss, questioned at tho
Navy Department, said ho know noth
ing about tho mattei Butler had bi ought
up.
Congressman Britten charged ho
would show tho Administration had
fallec to put Into commission a atnglo
ship authorized In the last four years.
"I will show," he said, "that unless
you and Mr. Wilson aro kept In onice
you will havo failed to put In commis
sion a slnglo battleship, destroyer, or
submarine. 1 don't mean rowboats or
launches.
Daniels denied this flatly. Both he
and Britten said they would show
proofs to support their contentions.
Daniels blamed Republicans for tho
condition of shipyards and tho mer
chant marine.

ATTORNEY FULTON
Justice Robb Says Lower Court
Erred in Rejecting Certain
Evidence in Case.
The conviction of Creed M. Fulton,
a member of tho District bar, on the
charge of embezzlement of funds of a
client, was reversed by tho District
Court of Appeals today, and a new trial
was ordered.
The cplnlon by Associato Justice
Robb sets aside the sentence of three
years given Fulton.
The Appellate court held that the low
er conn erred In not pel mining Fulton
to offer In evidence a carbon copy of a
letter ho declared ho had wrltton Fred
erick II. Smith, the chlct witness for
the prosecution, and ultimately permit
ting tho Government to offer tho copy
for purposes of discrediting It In argu
ments to tho Jury
The upper couit also held that the
verdict wnn Inconsistent In that Fulton
was declared gulltv on both tho first
and third counts of tho Indictment.
Tho ownership of tho fund was alleged
In Smith Individually in tho first count,
and In the third. It was said to be the
property of smith and seventeen others
Involved In tho estate.
In referring to the admission of the
letter by the Government, Justlco -Robb
describes tho error of the lower court
ao prejudicial to the defondnnt
"Thus," said tho court, "his shield
was seized, beaten Into a sword and
turned against him."
The question of "evil Intent," the
Appellate Couit points out, "Is vital
In a charge of embezzlement and It
was not clearly proved "
The amount Involved In the Fulton
case was $659 alleged by tho Govern
ment to have been the property of the
Harriet Smith estato and "converted
to his own use" by tho defendant.
The case was brought to the Court
of Appeals by Attorneys. L. II. David,
Wilton J Lambert, and D. IJ. An
