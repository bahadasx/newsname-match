The Hague, April

and that government intends to buy
100,000 tons of wheat in America in
addition to the normal 60.000 tons
monthly, in order to form a needed
reserve. Several Dutch ships have
been requisitioned under the new
ship law to bring these supplies from
America.
The disappearance of the reserve
Is due to the failure of the Holland
America, and other steamship com
panies- to fulfill completely their con
tract to transport 60.000 tons of
wheat and flour, and 7o.000 tons of
corn from North and South America,
owing to delay caused by war inci

grant the request thst has Just been

tons of corn monthly, then the above
mentioned purchase will be corre

alrymen encountered tbe fleeing forces of Villa's men near Deleted eariy
today. Sounds of firing have been heard from that, direction, but no
report has been made to headquarters as to tlie results. The mountains
of Guerrero are being combed thorouglily for VUla by American forces,
but nothing has been learned as to his whereabouts other than that
captured bandits said he is being carried farther into the mountains in
his jolting ooach.
INFANTRYMEN TO CO-OPERATE.
General Pershing announced that troops of infantry are to be used
for mountain climbing in the seaivlr for Villa, and are co-operating with
the cavalrymen, who have borne tlie brunt of tlic five days' pursuit of the
broken bandits. Infantrymen have been going through a hardening
preparation in hill climbing marches for about two weeks, and tbetr
officers say they are in excellent physical trim.
CLOSELY BEHIND REBEL.
Troops were closely behind Villa yesterday, entering the village of
Deleted shortly after lie had fled from it. It is expected that he might
lie hidden in one of its hut/*, and every precaution is taken to effect bis
capture. Two squadrons of cava!ry eutered the village from opposite
sides simultaneously. Every preparation had lieen made for an engage
ment. which failed to develop. There have been a number of minor
skirmishes in the vicinity bf villages, two scouts reporting they encoun
tered two Villa men on its outskirts yesterday and fought for five min
utes without casualties.
AIR SCOUTS VERY ACTIVE.
American air-scouts now are flying over the entire Villa territory,
carrying dispatches from the front to the field base and field headquar
ters. Motor trucks also have been able to penetrate the mountain waste
almost as far as tlie territory occupied by the cavalry under Colonel Dodd.
CREDIT REPORTS OF DESERTION.

CARRANEA CO-OPERATION IS GREATER.
San Antonio. Tex.. April 8.—Interest in military circles is divided
between speculation as to the attitude of the Carranza troops in the
state of Chihuahua and Conjecture as to the present whereabouts of
Villa. Official Information Is lacking in both questions. If Villa has
escaped from the Guerrero district and is pushing south toward Dur
ango. the difficulties of Pershing's problem are greatly increased.
Since the fight, at Guerrero last Wednesday. In which the Villa forces
were routed, the American troops have been engaged in making a thor
ough search for the bandit in the surrounding country. It is predict
ed by officers at Funston's headquarters that the next news from
Pershing will tell that his cavalry oolumns are moving southward
from Guerrero in an effort to pick up the trail of the fugitive. Funs
