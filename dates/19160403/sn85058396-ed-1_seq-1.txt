9 More Villa Bandits Are Locatecl Near
Bachineva By American Cavalrymen
I PERSHING'S MEN CONTINUE PURSUIT
IN NORTHEAST GUERRERO REGION
Much Misleading Information Given and Reliable Guides Dif
ficult to Obtain Fight Between Villa and Carranza
Forces Under Colonel Cano on March 29 Reported
Bandit Leader Emmanuel Boco Killed
Rumor of Cano's Disloyalty Unfounded
Americans Obtain Corn and Beef
Cattle From Mexicans.
Laredo, Texas, April 3. Military authorities at Nuevo
Laredo opposite here declared today the reported defection of
Colonel Cano's forces in Chihuahua was untrue. They said
the Chihuahua forces were loyal and "working indefatigably
for the apprehension of Villa."
San Antonio. Texas, April 3 The
detachment of Villa's forces defeated
at Guerrero by American troops Wed
nesday was located yesterday near
Bachineva, northeast of Guerrero, ac
cording to General Pershing who re-
l ported today to General Funston. His
(j report was sent Sunday.
The remainder of the dispersed
force, he said, was scattered through
the region northeast of Guerrero and
American troops are continuing their
pursuit.
General Pershing said Villa himself
had not been located and added that
his intelligence department had been
given much, misleading information
and that securing reliable guides was
becoming more difficult. Grazing for
the animals was scarce, he reported,
but some grain had been found.
Colonel Cano Loyal.
Washington, April 3. A fight be
tween one of the smaller groups of
Villa and Carranza 'forces, the latter
"under Colonel Cano, on March 29, was
reported to the war department this
afternoon by General Funston, Sman
uel Boco, the Villa- leader, was killed.
Although previous reports had plac
ed doubt upon the loyalty of Colonel
Cano, General Funston's 'report indi
cated that he was aiding the American
troops against Villa,
Pershing's Official Report
The war department's statement fol
lows: "A dispatch just received through
General Funston from General Persh
ing tells us that one of the smaller
bands into which the Villa force scat
tered was struck by Colonel Cano on
March 29, with the result that Eman
uel Boco, the leader, was killed. This
I seems to dispose finally of the rumor
K of disloyalty on the part of Colonel
Cano.
"The report further tells us: That
while grazing is scarce, corn of In
ferior quality Is plentiful, and that
beef cattle are available in sufficient
quantity. Two additional truck com
panies are now at work and General
Pershing reports the supply system Is
generally Improved. Communication
between the front and Casas Grandes
Is maintained by aeroplane."
Camp of General J. J. Pershing at
the Front, April 2, (By Aeroplane to
' Colonia Dublan, and by Radio to Co
lumbus, N. M., April 3.) American
cavalrymen encountered a fleeing
force of Villlstas near early
today and sounds of firing have been
heard from that direction but no re
port has been made to headquarters
as to the results.
The mountains of Guerrero are be
ing combed thoroughly for Francisco
Villa by the American forces, but
nothing has been learned as to his
I whereabouts other than that captured
bandits said he was being carried
farther into the mountains in his jolt

Infantry Mountain Climbing.
General Pershing announced today
that troops of the infantry are to be
used for mountain climbing in the
search for Villa, co-operating with the

In one of its huts and every precau
tiol was taken to effect the capture.
Two squadrons of cavalry entered the

made for the engagement which failed
to develop. . , ,

!they encountered two VilHstas on its
outskirts yesterday and fought for
five minutes without casualties.
Air Scouts Busy.
American air scouts are now flying
over the entire Villa territory and are
carrying dispatches from the -front to
the field base and field headquarters.
Motor trucks also have been able to
penetrate the mountain wasto aQ0

A "Villa has again become the man of
aovBtery Almost within tho grasp or
5 ithe American cavalry after the bat-
jtle of Guerrero, the bandit is report-
' , M today to hare jUppad.-th.Miet- clos-
y 1 '
ing about him and to have covered
the trail of his flight. Mexican offi
cials in Juarez sought information of
the brigand's whereabouts but the
land lines brought no definite word.
Mexican reports had it that Villa
and another band of his followers
were moving on Chihuahua with the
intention of getting, the garrison of
the de facto government to revolt and
join him against the Americans.
These reports brought here by trav
elers were scouted by Mexican Con
sul Garcia.
Villa's Large Forces.
While the bandit's main command
was scattered at the battle of Guer
rero It Is believed here than Villa has
several other large bodies of men dis
posed at convenient positions in the
nnntinonUl . iir-fl-i otw. fli-,- HAlnnfll
Dodd and his troopers may come In
contact with them at any time. While
the search for Villa continues, Colo
nel Dodd will at once seek to de
stroy these armed bodies of Vllllstas
who are a constant menace to the
-line -of American communications.
There is no light on the recent
operations of the Carranza forces
against the VilHstas. General Bcr
tani has sent no report to the Juarez
headquarters for several days and
what assistance the troops, or the de
facto government, is giving General
Pershing and his men In not known.
Traffic More Active.
Traffic over the Mexico Northwest
ern railway is becoming more active
since the advent of the American ex
peditionary forces in the Casas Gran
des and Madeira districts. A freight
train arrived from Casas Grandes this
morning. Later in the day a mixed
passenger and freight train started
out for Pearson, 30 miles south of
Casas Grandes. Two carloads of
oats and two carloads of express mat
ter, shipped by private parties but ex
pected eventually to reach the army,
made up the freight consignment. The
passengers included many Americans
returning to the interior after flight
to the border following the Columbus
massacre.
Bandit Not Wounded.
Nothing was said in the reports of
Villa's alleged Injuries, an omission
which helped to confirm the opinion
already freely expressed on tho bor
der that the bandit's wounds were an
Inventing of his own, reported with
the intention of deceiving his pursu
ers. Tho absence of any official news
from the front since the defeat of the
VilHstas near Guerrera by Colonel
Dodd last Wednesday has consider
ably dashed the hopes of those who
saw in the victory tho beginning of
the end of the bandit's career. At
tho same time. It Is pointed out that
the American cavalrymen have a for
mldablo taBk before them In search
ing the barren mountain wastes
where Villa 16 supposed to havo tak
en refuge. The fact that no further
fighting has been reported is taken
as an Indication that the bandits
have been effectually scattered by the
American troopers.
Border a Hive of Rumors.
As usual', in the lack of definite in
formation tho border is again" a hive
of rumors of an alarming and sensa
tional nature. The majority of the
rumors are based on stories brought
from the interior by Mexicans and
the few Americans who straggle in
here by ones and twos dally. The
most circumstantial of these stories
at present deals with the reported
defection of Colonel Cane, the Car
ranza commander at Namlquipa.
There is a great deal of mystery at
tached to tho movement of Mexican
troops at points close to the border.
It is known that large bodies of Car
ranza soldiers have been moved from
camps in the interior to various
places within twenty miles of tho in
ternational line, but no explanation
has been given of these maneuvers,
hoyond a general intimation that tho
de facto government is anticipating
possible action by tho followers of
Felix Diaz, who Ib now consldored the
head of the clentlfico party.
Stories Flatly Contradictory.
Most of the stories brought from
the interior are flatly contradictory,
especially those from Moxlcan
Bources. American refugees general
ly agree In describing conditions as
alarming but they invariably refused
to be quoted on the ground that they
expect to return to Mexico and are
afraid of arousing prejudices against
themselves. Their stories are offset
by tho fact that several of -their-num
bers, who fled across the border after
the Columbus massacre, have return
ed to their former homes convinced
that they have nothing to fear.

TRUCK TRAINS EQUIPPED
VilHstas Badly Broken Up,
Scattered and Completely
Demoralized by Ameri-
fcan Attack at Guerrero.
El Paso, Tex., April 3. Some light
is thrown on the movements of Gen
eral Luis Herrera, recently reported
as defecting from General Carranza,
by travelers arriving here from Chl
huahua City. These say that they
saw General Herrera at Laguna, some
thirty-five miles north of Chihuahua
on the Mexico National railway and
that he had under him a command
estimated at 1500 men. Recent re
ports had General Herrera setting out
with 1200 men toward the district in
which Villa is operating. Laguna oc
cupies a strategic position at the end
of tho trail leading eastward through
Chihuahua from the Guerrero dis
trict. It is believed here that if Herrera,
as contended by Mexican officials, is
co-operating with the American for
ces he will be able to cut off Villa's
escape in that direction.
Motor Trains Equipped.
At the quartermaster's depot here
"today It was announced that equip
ment of the motor truck trains oper
ating between Columbus, N. M.f and
Casas Grandes has about been com
pleted. Only a few more machines
are to bo added. The motor trains
have reached the necessary state ot
efficiency, It Is said, and while use
of the Mexican Northwestern would
be very advantageous, it is not longer
necessary.
Only three of tho twenty-two Vil
Hstas recently thrown into tho El
Paso Jail now remain there. The re
mainder, including three former gen
erals, have been released and ordered
out of town. Colonels Pedro Morales,
Emlllo Galvan and Manuel C. San
chez are tho ones in custody.
On the start of the expeditionary
force into Mexico local officials took
every possible precaution to prevent
an outbreak here. Tho result was a
round up of suspected VilHstas.

GERMANS TO RUSH
VERDUN FORTRESS
Vast Forces of Men With New
Batteries of Large Caliber
Move Closer to French
Front.
FIERCE COUNTER BLOWS
German Gains More Than Off
set Their Very Heavy Losses
Complete Failure at
Avocourt.
Paris, April 3, 5:40 a. m. A new
phase of the battle of Verdun has be
gun and the belief prevails that the
violence of the latest attacks fore
shadows another attempt by the Ger
mans to rush the fortress with vast
forces. New batteries of large caliber
have been moved up closer to the
French front and the German Infantry
has been rested and reorganized.
Yesterday's fighting on the whole
was not unfavorable to the French, It
Is authoritatively stated. The object
of the Germans was to clear the ap
proaches to Fort Douaumont and 15,
000 men were thrown forward on the
mile and half lino between Douaumont
fort and the village of Vaux. The
attacking force succeeded In crossing
a little ravine which hitherto had
stopped them and in entering the Call
lette wood. Further east they dis
lodged the French from the last ruin
ed houses of the village of Vaux, but
tho French positions were so placed
as to make It practically Impossible
for tho Germans to debouch from the
village. Vigorous French counter at
tacks drove them back to tho upper
fringe of Caillette wood.
The total result of the very formid
able effort they had put forth was a
gain for the Germans of about 500
yards of terrain, more than offset, it
Is affirmed, by the very heavy losses
they had endured.
On the west of tho river the Ger
' mans attacked the Avocourt block
house In a no less determined man
ner, but again met with complete fail
ure, tho observers declare.

FOR DHBRES5
Salt Lake, April 3. The Tribune
says:
William E. Rydalch of this city Is a
candidate for the Republican nomina
tion for congressman from this dis
trict He announced to his friends
yesterday that, while ho would make
no active campaign for the nomina
tion, he was in the field.
This occasioned no surprise among
Republican politicians, however, it
having been bruited about for some
tlmo that Mr. Rydalch was coming out
for congress A number of his friends
have been talking of him for the
nomination.
Mr. Rydalch is well known In Salt
Lake and throughout the Second con
gressional district comprising this
county, Davis, Tooele and Utah coun
ties. He Is now a practicing lawyer
here. For a number of years he
practiced law In Utah county. He is
a "native son" and was the first Utah
man to be awarded tho gold medal
for oratory and debating at the law
school of tho University of Michigan
of which he is an alumnus. While
Mr Rydalch has been active in the
Republican party for years, he has
never held office.
Present indications are that the
contest for tho Republican congres
sional nomination in this district will
be between Mr. Rydalch and Attor
ney General A. R. Barnes. Mr..
Barnes advised his friends several
weeks ago that he would bo a candi
date for congress. Those two have
been the only ones thus far to an
nounce themselves.
