New Tork, April .-Arthur Warren
Waite. the dentist under indictment for
poisoning his farther-in-law. John E.
Peck. made a new confession, his fourth.
today. ie sent for his lawyer, Walter
Rt. Deuel. and made a long statement
which Dr. Deuel. at Walte's request,
made public.
"I want to go to the electric chair."
Waite said. "I do not fear death-lin
fact. I seek death. It is the only atone
ment I can make for my crimes. My
-onscience has been quickened.
"It is true. and there is no sense in
offering a defense,. that -I murdered
both my mother-in-law and my father
in-law. I have confessed the truth to
Judge Swann. who has been vcry kind
to me. He knew the facts a week ago.
and what I am saying now is merely
an amplification and explanation of
what was published several days ogo.
Urged by Greed.
"If people ask why a young man of
my opportunities in life, of my educa
tion and social position, fell so low as
to kill his benefactors, they can be told
that It was solely and simply for the
greed of money. I wanted money, a
lot of it. and I was not willing to wait
until it came to me naturally and hon
orably. The trouble with me was that
I had oo easy a time. I rade friends
too easity. I had got out of the habit
of work. I had acquired expensive
tastes. I wanted automobiles and lux
urious living. I wanted to travel. I
wanted to be able to sign checks for
big sums. I wanted to feel the crinkle
of bank bills.
"When I look back now it is hard for
me to realize that I could have sent Mrs.
Perk and Mr. Peck out of life without
a tin.ge of remorse. But all I could
s. e was the 350.0, or so, that they were
preventing me from having by staying
alive. With them out of the way, there
was only my wife between me and half
of the Peck estate. I knew to a dollar
what that estate was worth, and I knew
that my wife's share must come to me.
Coatemies a Relilef.
"I made my plans carefully, though I
can see now that I blundered in execut
In- them. Just as all criminals blunder
at some time or other. I left plain tracks
wherever I went. I could have been
convicted even if I had not made a con
frsion. I don't nced to be a lawyer to
know that. But confession relieves me.
My awakened conscience demands it.
"Therefore. I say that I poisoned my

Roosevelt's Growing Strength
Since Root Luncheon Im
presses Republicans.
Spesal to The Washington Herald.
Oyster Bay, N. Y., April 2.-Rapid ex
changes are expected to take place in
the political situation during the com
ing fortnight. These developments will
probably reveal other Republican leaders
following in Senator Root's footsteps in
making peace with Col. Roosevelt.
It is felt that because Senator Root,
who stands out as the dominant leader
of the Republican party, has seen fit to
shake the hand of the Colonel and call
matters square, others in the party will
fall In behind him and do the same
thing.
Roosevelt's growing strength and the
confusion caused by the burying of the
hatchet at the Root-Roosevelt petit
dejeuner is believed to be Impressing Re
publicans all over the country with the
inevitableness of the Colonel's part in
the coming campaign. It Is also believ
ed to be an efficacious method of scar
ing off the followers of Justice Hughes.

WAR SECRETARY TO ASK
TEN MORE REGMENTS
Addition to Force by Congess Would
Be Considered as Fitting Mark
of Appreciation.
W1. Dodd's splendid cavalry dash after
Vi!liras in Mexico has inspired Secre
ary of War Baker to strongly urge that
CongreFi authorizc an increase of -ten
regiments to the cavalry arm of the
service. Secretary Baker feels that no
better illustration could be had of the
value of mounted troops than the pres
ent Mexican expedition end Col. Dodd's
achievement has had the effect of cen
lering the attention of army officers on
the Importance of having a cavalry-in
rrease prov ision inserted in the present
army bill.
The iner'ased army legislation has pass
Id the House and is now before the Ren
ste. It is expected that Secretary Baker's
recommendation may be inserted inl the
till as Pn amendmcnt on the floor, to
bie considered in the conference on the
bill. Both the chairman of the House
end S'mate 1i lary Committees have at.
ready bccn Inform-d of Secretary
Baker's recomme ndation.

Even before Col. iodds ride. which re
suited in the ftrlu setere blow to Villa
Rnd bb followers. Gen. Funston Is under
stood to have brought the matter or
cavalry-nirease to the attention of Chief
of Staff Scott. Gen. Scott took the mat
ter up with Secretary Raker and the
Secretary, in turn. brought the matter
informally to the attention of members
of the military committees of both
branches of Congress.
]low far this matter would have been
pressed under ordinary circumstances is
a matter of speculation. but Col. Dodd's
ride has focused attention on the recom
mendatlon. As a result It is expected
that Congress will act. Incidentally, it
is pointed out in army circles that this
would be a very fitting expression of
appreciation from Congress of what
Amerlcan regular-mounted troops have
done in Mexico, besides being of prac
tical benefit to the army.
