that he would lie more than glad tu

in response to the request that had
heen made by the president of the
l!)1f commission and numerous
friends anil business acquaintances
of Mr. Southard.
Southard Makes Statement.
An attempt was made last night to
secure from Mr- Southard a statement
us to what action he will take when
the formal commission reaches him,
hut he refused to commit himself
other than to say that the forces
which will determine him In either
accept Ins or refusing the position are
entirely outside Iuh control, hut that
as sooii as the formal commission is
received hp will attempt to place him-
self In a position where he will feel j
satisfied to assume the xvork con-.
nected with the presidency of the
fair. Those who have been urKinU
Mr. Southard to accept the position
believe that the conditions under
which he will consent to be named
a member of the fair commission will

him his aim will be to hold Just as

Appointee- H Hustler.
The man who is being- urged to as
sume the presidency has been a resi
dent of New Mexico for a number of
venrs u. creator Dart of his residence
i. u. in T.AM Vceas. Mr. 1
(IUV1IIA, u-rr ii oj'vuv ... - -r.--
Southard came to Albuquerque two
ears ago and immediately entered
into the public life of the city and
Its public organizations with a zeal
and ability which at once marked hhn
as a valuable asset to Albuqtieniue.
Hut a few months after taking
his residence here he was elected

special recommendation for a place
no thn r-lnii directorate was his rec
ord as president of the Fast Las
A'egas Commercial club. As head of
tion. he hrousht It Into
new power and usefulness and dem
onstrated his ability as a leader and
a hustler- Since coming- to Albuquer
que. Mr. Southard has sriven much of
his time and effort to every move
ment that has been for the ptthll"
good, until he has become marked
as a worker who will never say quit
until results are secured. Those who
know him consider that his selection
for presidency of the fair is an Ideal
rne and that the fate of the 191 ex
position is safe In his hands.
Headquarters Appealed To.
Rven the securing of Mr. Southard
an a possibility for the state fair pres
idency was fraught with considerabl.;
difficulty, and had not It. K. Putney
tackled the matter with his usual
forcefulness, the fair would certainly
have to do without the services of the
manager tf the Electric company.
Some days ago Mr. mitney called a
meeting of : few men most vitally
Interested in; the fair and broached
tho matter of a new commission. It
was agreed that the right man for
the place would he difficult to find.
Southard was mentioned, but when
approached he flatly declined and as
serted that even should he desire to
accept, the taking on of such a re
sponsibility could not b considered
In view of the fact that his first busi
ness allegiance, is to the Federal
Light & Traction company, which lo
the owner of the local public utility
concern.
lietlcrHl lrcidont PW-amsl.
Relieving Mr. Southard to be the
logical utah for the Job, and feeling
that there was much at stake, Mr.
I'utney took up the matter of the
appointment with the president of
the Federal Light ft Traction com
pany, Mr. K. X- Sanderson. Accord

the position of the state fair, calling

attention to the fact that Albuquer
que is going to ask for an adequate
State appropriation next year m sup
port the fair and that the success or
failure of the 1916 fair will have ev
erything to do with the securing- or
failure to secure that appropriation.
Mr. Sanderson was told that Mr.
Southard's ability Is held in high es
teem by the citizens of Albuquerque,
and that it looked very much us
though U was a matter of having
Southard for president or having no
fair.
Those who know Mr. Sanderson
and the attitude of the Albuquerque
Oas, Electric Light & Power com
pany toward matters of public good
never doubled the nature of the re
ply that would be received. In a few
days came back a telegram from
New York stating that the company
feels honored that its local manager
should be chosen for such a position
and requesting- that Mr. Southard be
further urged to accept the position.

Americans Slightly .Wounded.
Unofficial information also had it
,in the engagement at San Heronlmo
ranch last Wednesday are expected to
arrive herP during the night. Tho
four American troopers wounded in
the Nimo battle, it was said, suffered
wounds which are not serious enough
to necessitate their being brought:
her? and probably will be taken to
the field hospital at Casus Hrandes I
for treatment.
Pay lny for Soldiers.
Approximately $:iO,(MiO was dis
tributed to the soldiers on station
here, the regular monthly pay day
i,.,l.,t' WHIln th,i usual lirprillltioilS
were taken to prevent trouble among
the men, the usual pay day excite
ment in a military camp was (com
pletely absent, the men apparently
reniizing the seriousness of the task
before the troops.
Palonias Abandoned.
When Jesus Sanca and his daugh
ter crossed tho American line today
at Palonias, the first Mexican town
through which the American troops
passed on thp way to the front, was
left without human Inhabitants. A
fexv lonely dog were howling at the
doors of the huddled little dirty group
of Mexican huts which made up 'the
town.
Sanca, X2 years of age, crossed Into
the United States in a prairie schoon
er, such aa used by the "forty-niners."
Loaded in it were his household goods,
while from the rear axle swung a
bucket under which trotted a stubby
tailpd dog. The horses were hitched
to the wagon by means of harness
fashioned from canvas cartridge belts
discarded bv Villlstas In their flignt
from Columbus. Sanca said that one
by one the residents had left the town,
lie, himself, he said, finally left alone,
was bound for Iteming, N, M., "para
siempre" (for always!.
Th question of the loyalty of the
Carranza troops has again come very
much to the fore here following- per
sistent reports that Colonel Cano, the
Carranaa commander at Namiqiilpa,
has joined Villa.
Andres Uarela. the Carranna con
sul here, has refused lo credit these
reports on the ground that Cano Is a
bitter personal enemy of Villa, but
he admits that nothing hu been heaid
from the Namiqiilpa commander for
more than a week.
In thp early days of the chase after
Villa, both Consul Harcia und Heneral
Havira, the commander at Juarer.,
made public several telegrams they
said they had received from Cano tell
ing of fights he had had with the Vil
listas. These telegrams stopped ab
ruptly about ten days ago.
The only direct information that
has comb from Namlquipii since then
has bpen a paragraph in dispatch
from C.pneral Pershing- in which It
was staled that half the gnrrlsoa at
j .
the town had disappeared and that it
was suspected some nf (lielii had Join
ed Villa.
AmcricanM who arrived lure from
Chihuahua City yesterday asserted
(hat Colonel Cano was with the VII
lislas defeated near Huerrero by
Colonel Dodd. but they admitted that
their only basis for the story was
street gossip in Chihuahua.
