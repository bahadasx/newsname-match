Kuhio Men Likely to Control
When Delegates to Chicago
Are Named This Afternoon
CASTLE M A TIE SENT- ' '
AS SECOND TO PRINCE
Rice and Lyman Spoken of as
Alternates; Many Slates
V Bruited About; Chiliingworth
Chairman; Big Rally Tonight
With 172 delegates to the territorial
Republican convention answering In
Iersoii or by proxy to the roll call,
the big meeting Is In full awing at the
skating rink at 2 o'clock this after
noon, and enthusiasm Is running high.
There, will be only two delegates
to the Chicago convention t- this
aeems a certainty now, for this num
ber looks like the wish of the maior
Uy as well as of the big men of the
party. .
Senator Charles F. Chiliingworth,
chairman of the convention, makes no
aecret of the fact that he is heartily
In favor of but two delegates.
A few old wheel horses of the party
men who have followed the work
ings of the various , factions predict
that while two delegates proper are
chosen from the list, fctir alternates
will also be named instead of two,
thus making up a list of six able to
' attend the convention.
Who will the two delegates be?
This is the question that la bothering
the majority, and in the big hall this
morning during the brief recess , it
was evident . that the . feeling was
growing tenser every moment.
Many persons predicted excitement
as soon as the election" of delegates
to Chicago is commenced. : Others be
lieved that quietness and harmory
would overrule, and that the election
would pass by without a single jar
ring note being struck.
Several resolutions will be present-.
' ed to. the convention. i Among these
will probably be. a; plea for the tariff
to be grounded on' good old Republi
can standards;-a 'plea for prepared
jiess; a resolution dealing "with the
admission of the Filipino as a citizen;
a resolution of praise for Delegate
Kuhio's work at Washington, and
others. ,. ".' ' ... '
Kuhlo is sure of a pi ac A with the
' "hIcago delegation, unless something
so far unforeseen develops. Practical
ly all members, follower and oppon
ents, concede him a place. Conserva
tives feel . the fearot aft outbreak
yhen the election starts. .
Candidate pickers place Kuhio and
Chas. Rice for first places, with Hen
ry. Lyman and Alfred L. Castle, alter
nates. This is .one choice, another
being Kuhio and Castle for first place,
with Rice and Lyman elected as al-
ternates. , j . ' '
One well-uefined story is that Ku
hio will oppose Rice, if a delegation
of only two is made up. It is no sec
ret that the delegate feels that Rice
has not."worked with him since, Rice
' was made national committeeman.
Therefore many look to see Kuhio
and Castle sent to Chicago as first
string delegates. v
Lively music from the city band
- started things off with jl vim this
morning, Peter Kalani's musicians
playing for half an bour at the en
trance to , the convention ball oefore
the convention began.
' Decorations from the Shriner's big
time on Saturday have been left In
the hall, and add much to the looks
t.f the place. . They Include bunting,
flags, palms an( flowers.
Chairman Lorrin Andrews of the
territorial committee tailed the meet
ing to order at 10:23 o'clock, the dele-.
Sates taking the respective sections
in the big halt. : .
v Secretary E. J. Crawford read tho
call for delegates, with a grand total
of delegates of 1SI.
Following the reading of the call
Chairman Andrews announced a com-
- xaittee on credentials, cqmposed of
men from each of the five, districts.
. The committee named was as fol
lows: Knoka Kaaua, second district;
J. J. Walsh, third district; G. P. Wil
der, fourth district; W. II. Crawford
fifth district, and J. II. Coney, sixth
district .

Hawaii Judgei Holds Parker

CASE HARD-FOUGHT AND '

Judge Matthewman Finds for
Defendant;. Appeal May :
.Be Taken
"' i' .. - '
Residents of the little village of Wal
mea, Hawaii, will, for the time being,
at least have all the water they need
from the Walkolca stream.
This much has been decided by Cir
cuit Judge John A. Matthewman, who
has found for the defendants in the
two-year-old case of A. W. Carter,
trustee, against the territory of Ha
waii et al, involving the rights to the
water in the WalkoJoa stream. In a
wireless message received yesterday
by Judge Antonio Perry, one" of the
counsel for the territory. Judge. Mat
thewman points out four distinctive
grounds upon which he based his finding.-';
'. .- ..'
The suit was begtm In June. 1914.
it being the contention of the plaintiff
that the big Parker Ranch had sole
right to the threej million oda gallons
of water which flowed daily in the
Waikoloa stream.1" While this amount
of water is more than the stream ac-'
tuially carries at certain periods, plain
tiff virtually laid claim to all the wa
ters of the stream.

TO CROSS-BILL
Claims Her Guardian Would
Reinstate Her as Plaintiff
4; in Kuhio Suit:
A motion to strike from the -records
the cross-bill, petition and other docu
ments, of Lcrrin , ; Andrews, "next
friend" and guardian ad litem of
Queen Lilluokalani, in which he al
leges that the queen is of unsound
mind and otherwise mentally incom
petent, was tiled In circuit court late
Saturday afternoon by Judge Antonio
Perry, counsel for, the queen. '
The queen's motion declares that
the documents filed by Andrews, "are
ini sul stance and effect an attempt.to
continue and to reinstate this movant,
Llliuckalanl, as a party plaintiff (al
though under the name and guise of
respondent) in this Suit originally
filed herein by . the present plaintiff,
Jonah Kuhio Kalanlanaole . . . and
that such attempt and the filing and
receiving on file' . . . is contrary
to law and to the rights of this
movant." ' .
It is further alleged tnat the. cross
bill filed by Andrews was, in reality,
an attempted original bill in tne guise
of a cross-bill, and that its prime pur;
pose is to reinstate Liliuokalanl as a
party plaintiff, to the suit although
she has been named by Circuit Judge
Stuart as a respondent The motion
further alleges that the court has no
jurisdiction to permit the filing of the
alleged cross-bill.' or to permit "the
renewal of the suit by any next friend
or guardian ad litem on purported be
half of this movant (the queen.)"
In connection with the motion,
Judge Perry also filed the demurrer
of Liliuokalanl to the suit filed by
Delegate Kuhio to break the trust in
which the queen's property now is
held. Ttye demurrer declares that
both the original and amended bill of
complaint fail to show where Kuhio
is entitled to have or maintain the
suit, or to obtain any of the relief
prayed for. It Is added that It ap
pears from the complaint that Ku
hio had no right, title or interest la
the property, or any part thereof, con
veyed by the deed of trust and other
instruments, or in the subject mat

It is now believed .possible that an

ed General Pershing and has fled in a
direction other than that in which the
American commander nas been led by
false reports, to believe. Headquar
ters officials also admitted last night,
that there Is a. growias feeling of tin

announced that there is reason to be

A confidential warning from spies

Villistas have been gathering In the

the purpose. of making a sudden raid
and cutting the lines of communica
