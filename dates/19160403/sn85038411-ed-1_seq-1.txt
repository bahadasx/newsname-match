Car Dynamited and Tracks
Blown Up at Wilkes-Barre
Wilkes-Barre. Pa.. April 3.—Rioting
in the Wyoming Valley gave way to
dynamiting outrages yesterday, when,
according to officials of the AVilkes-
Barre Railway Company, 75 pounds of
explosives were used in wrecking a car
and the roadbed on the Harvey's Txike
division and in blowing up the tracks
on the Hudson branch, of the com
pany's lines. Dynamite caps were
placed on the rails of the South Main
street division last night, but the dam- ,
age was not serious.
Dynamite caps on the South Main '
street line in this city caused eonsid- !
erable disorder, but little damage was
done.
Guards have been doubled in out- >
side towns to prevent further dyna- i
miting outrages on the part of strike
sympathizers. While cars were not
operating on all divlsons yesterday,
because of flooded conditions, the full
State police force and the scores of
Sheriff's deputies are expected to be
able to reduce lawlessness to a mini
mum and eventually to wipe it out.
