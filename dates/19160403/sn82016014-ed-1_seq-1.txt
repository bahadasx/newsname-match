Wave of Speculation Is Sweep

Pan Francisco. April 3. That Japan
Is colonizing and apparently intends to
retain the South sea islands captured
.faring the present war from the (Ger
mans was the statement made here
by Dr. Frederick Starr, professor of
anthropology, University of ( 'hicago.
who was en route to t 'hicngo today
from the orient after six months' re
search work in Japan and Korea.
"Japan," said Dr. Starr, "has no in
tention of withdrawing from the Ia
drone or Marshall islands which she
has taken from ilermany and which
lie about midway between the Philip
pines and Hawaii. She has already
undertaken expensive schemes with
reference to the postal service, tele
graphs and cables of these posses
sions. She is sending settlers in quan
tity to them.
"Since the war began in Europe,"
continued Dr. Starr, "more than 1.00H
new millionaires have been made in
Japan. Extravagant ideas have taken
nonsesston of the Japanese nation and
a wave of speculation is sweeping
over the country." Dr. Starr said ..ls
that Japanese trade with India had in
creased enormously since the war
and that in this development lay the
possibility of future competition with
Oreat Uritain. which might endanger
the friendship that now exists be
tween the two nations.

Went to Five Companies.
Washington, April 3. Hearings on
Representative Borland's resolution to
have the federal trade commission in
vestigation whether the meat packers
are violating the anti-trust laws, were
begun today by a house judiciary sub
committee. Arthur Meeker, vice pres
ident of Armour and company; R. C.
McManuB, representing Swift & Com
pany and several cattle raisers, op
posed the resolution. Former Gov
ernor Stubbs of Kansas, Walter I.,.
Fisher, former secretary of the in
terior, and Edmund Burke of Omaha,
and them arket committee of the
American Livestock association, sup
ported it. Representative Borland
opened for the resolution by the read
ing letters from farmers in several
states who complained chiefly of al
leged price fixing by the packers.
Double Cinch on Prices.
Representative Borland insisted
that the pockers buyers not only fix
prices In the markets but follow cat
tie from the country to the yards to
see that certain fixed prices are main
tained on them.
"There is a power which actually
exists fri rive packing companies in
this country not only to control the
price of products, but also to dictate
the terms under which business shall
be done." said he. Representative Doo
little of Kansas, also appeared in be
half of the resolution.
Representative Doolittle insisted
that the packers made greater nrofits
than ever, during the last year, while
breeders failed in large numbers. Urg
ed to give a concrete case of price fix
ing, Mr. Doolittle said that George
Johnson of Emporia. Kan., got only
one bid on a drove of cattle at the
yards, but he found after selling that
they were divided between five com
panies. Have Working: Agreement.
Representative Kent of California
declared "the existence of this com
bination is so well known that they
have never had the nerve to deny it
to me." Representative Steele of
Iowa, a commission man, declared
flatly that the packers fixed prices
through a working agreement, but he
opposed the resolution because it
would bring no benefits to the farm
ers. Former inquiries, he insisted, re
sulted in less money for the raisers.
Governmental regulation by one body
over all stock yards was the solution of
the packing problem, he maintained.

Complete Report on Result at
Thursday's Meeting.
Topeka may be the scene of a series
of strikes and walk-outs in the next i
few weeks. Today, all union men em
ployed on the hundreds of building
jobs In the City will refuse to continue!
work unless the nonunion laborers i
promise to obtain union cards. Fur- ;
ther, union men will refuse to work
under boss contractors who have sub
contracts with nonunion firms for any
part of the work.
Half a dozen unions will participate ,
in this movement today. They include
tfca carpenters' union, brick and stone i
masons' union, electricians" union,
plumbers union, painters union, sheet
and iron metal workers' union, hod
carriers and building laborers' union.
Notified Boss Today.
When union men went to work this
morning they notified all boss con
tractors of their intention. Then
members of the union fired questions
at all men employed on the job with
them. Refusal to take out a union
card will call for instant action on the
part of the union, according to an an

on the hundreds of jobs in progress in
prosperous Topeka will have either
shown his union card or will promise
to enter the organization. There are
very few jobs in progress where con

exclusively. In the last few months
500 new members have been added to
the various unions."

Several May Die as Result of
the Explosion.
Buffalo. April 3. Twenty-five men
were injured, several probably fctaJly,
in an explosion at the plant of the
tis Elevator company here today. Th
accident was attributed to the explo
sion of a gas tank in the foundry.
The roof of the building, which
was of stevl and concrete construction,
was blown off and the interior was
badly damaged. More than one hun
dred men were at work in t he plan
when the explosion occurred. The
cause other than the fact that it came
from a gas tank, has not yet been as
certained. Twenty-two of the injured were
taken to hospita Is and three less se
riously hurt were taken to their homes,
of the injured it was said that five
were probably fatally hurt.
No estimate was given as the the
property loss.

Bombing Plot Arrested.
GIVEN CASH TO BUY DYNAMITE
But Spent It on Himself;
Thought Hudson Crazy.
Concocted Dare-Devil Scheme
to Blow Up Cnnard Liner.
Xew York, April 3. One of the
three men named by Clarence Regi
nald Hudson, alias Ernest Schiller, as
his assistants in an alleged conspiracy
to blow up with dynamite the Cunard
line steamship Pannonia, is still at
liberty but the police say they expect
to arrest him before night.
Hudson, who captured the British
ship Matoppo at sea and awed her
crew of 56 men by a display of re
volvers, will he arraigned in court In
connection with the Pannonia plot as
soon as the case against him is com
pleted. George Haller and Otto Milleder,
arrested last night and held under
minor charges as Hudson's fellow
conspirators, admitted today they had
frequent conferences with Hudson
concerning his plans to blow up Brit
ish or French vessels lying at piers
here.
Had Plenty of Money.
They said they had received money
from him to buy dynamite, a motor
boat, revolvers or other supplies, but
they asserted that they spent his
money for their own benefit and
pawned revolvers he bought for them.
"I was working Schiller for what I
could get. said Milleder. "I got about
$30 out of him to buy dynamite, but I
spent the money on myself. He told
me about his scheme to blow up ships
lying at the piers of the Cunard and
Anchor lines. I thought he was crazy
and decided to take his money. I did
not try to buy any dynamite."
Milleder said that he went with
Hudson to look over the vessels at the
piers of the Anchor and Cunard lines
and that Hudson said he did not want
to injure any but English ships.
Wrote to Woman for Money.
Haller said Hudson proposed to him
within a few minutes after they met
to blow up a Cunard line steamship.
He said that Hudson planned to cross
the river from Hobo ken in a launch
climb aboard the steamer carrying
dynamite, and when the steamer was
outside of Sandy Hook hold up the
captain. blow up the steamer and
escape in lifeboats.
"We took Hudson to be crazy, said
Haller. "and decided to get what
money there wa In it. He told us to
get the money from a young woman
in Salem. Mass.. so I wrote and told
her that Hudson was locked up and
that 1 wanted $60. She sent it by spe
cial delivery. I wrote again for $20,
but she did not send It."

J. G. Stenhouse. the first officer who
i brought the vessel from Ross sea. ex
pressed confidence that Sir Ernest
Shackelton had succeeded in making
; his trip across the pole, according to
schedule.
Chief Officer Stenhouse explaining
the circumstances after the Aurora
broke adrift, said:
"It might look as if we were run
; ning away to save ourselves, but as a
matter of fact the ship was so buckled
; by her six weeks' pressure from the
! ice. that the ship's party were on the
I point of abandoning her and sending
j a wireless message to the king, re
I questing that another expedition oe
i sent, when she managed to get clear.
It was a sad home-going, but it was
utterly impossible for the ship to be
' .f any use in her condition. T hope
i to return with the same personnel and
; to pick up the parties left ashore."
Drifted Away in Blizzard.
Mr. Stenhouse said they had taken
1 enough hawsers and anchors to moor
j a battleship, but they snapped like
lihieads in the blizzard.
''As our ship drifted away." ne said.
"we could see plainly lights, ?n the

TROOPS IN KANSAS
Ten Thousand -May Maneuver
Here This Summer.
Five States Plan to Send Sol
diers to Fort Riley.
GOVERNMENT FINANCE IT
Uncle Sam Will Be Asked to
Arrange for Expense.
Greatest Army Gathering in
History of the State.
Missouri may send 3,000 national
guardsmen to Kansas next summer
for the maneuvers at Fort Riley.
Plans are now being worked out for
a joint meet of the militiamen of
Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyo
ming to meet at Riley in late July
or early August. Today General
Clark of Missouri, wrote to Charles I.
Martin, adjutant general of Kansas, in
which he offered to entertain a plan
to bring Missouri troops to this state.
The joint meet may bring 10,000 to
12,000 troops to Kansas.
If plans now considered can be
worked out. Kansas will this year hold
one of the biggest army maneuvers
staged in the west in years. The en
tire western division Kansas. Ne
braska, Colorado. Wyoming and Mis
souri may participate. It is the first
time in the history of the division that
a joint field meet has been held. Fi
nancial aid for the project is being
sought from the federal government.
An appropriation bill before a sub
committee in congress will probably
provide the necessary funds.
Invited to Missouri.
In his letter to Genera .Martin to
day, General Clark of Missouri, in
vited the Kansas troops to visit Ne
vada, Mo., for maneuvers to be held
in July. In view of the plan to hold
a joint encampment this year. Gen
eral Clark intimated that arrange
ments might be made to bring the
Missouri troops to Kansas. It is al
most impossible, he said, to send the
Missouri soldiers to Fort Robinson,
Neb. The Nebraska fort is the one
competitor against Fort Riley for the
big military gathering. The attitude
of the Missouri soldiers in favoring
Fort Riley, will doubtless result in
bringing the guardsmen to this state.
Military reports show that Missouri
has a larger number of national
guardsmen than any other state in the
western group. The state has four
regiments of infantry, which recruited
to war strength would represent 7,740
men. There are probably 3,000 men
in the service at this time. Nearly all
of these men. General Clark stated,
have arranged for vacation periods
during the maneuvers. If a satisfac
tory time can be fixed for the holding
of the big military meet at Fort Riley,
the Missmirians will come.
Other states in the group would
bring the attendance during the man
euvers to nearly 10,000. Letters and
telegrams from army officers in other
states indicate they will strongly favor
the plan for a joint mobilization of
troops. The maneuvers would con
tinue ten days and would greatly over
shadow any former military demon
stration in this state.
500000 RESERVES
Spanish War Veterans Plan
Auxiliary to U. S. Army.
Will Include Able Bodied Men
Who Have Seen Service.
Chicago. April 3. Plans are being
considered today by the United States
Veterans' legion, an auxiliary of the
IT'nited States Spanish War veterans,
i for an active campaign for enlistment
! immediately after the charter for the
(organization is returned from Wash
ington, which is expected this week.
More than two hundred members of
the legion, which has a membership
of about 5,000 men, yesterday drew up
plans for a rally of all Spanish war
veterans in this city to be held when
the charter arrives. Frank Sims, who
presided at yesterday's meeting. said
the legion expected to enlist men who
have seen actual service in time of
war. "There are no lens than a quar
ter of a million in the ranks of the
United Spanish war veterans," he said.
"We also shall enlist all able bodied
men of good character who have
served in the army and navy and in
the national guards of the several
states. Thus, we will be able to pro
vide a reserve citizen army of at least
500,000 trained men, who will be
available instantly.

BATTLE ROARED ALL NIGHT
Paris Claims French Gain in
Caillette Wood.
Teutons Moving Up Huge Siege
Guns to Pound Forts.
Paris, April 3. A new phase of the j
battle of Verdun has begun and the j
belief prevails that the violence of
the latest attacks foreshadows another j
attempt by the Germans to rush the :
fortress with their vast forces. New '
batteries of large caliber have been
moved up closer to the French front
and the German infantry has been j
rested and reorganized.
Yesterday's fighting on the whole
was not unfavorable to the French
it is authoritatively stated. The ob
ject of the Germans was to clear the i
approaches to Fort Douaumont and
1 5,000 men were thrown forward on
the mile and half line between Dou
aumont fort and the village of Vaux.
The attacking force succeeded in j
crossing a little ravine which hitherto
had stopped them and in entering the
Caillette wood. Further east they dis
lodged the French from the last
ruined house of the village of Vaur: .
but the French positions wore so j
placed as to make it practically im- i
possible for the Germans to debouch !
from the village.
Vigorous French counter attacks
drove them back to the upper fringe
of Caillette wood. The total result of
the very formidable effort they had j
put forth was a gain for the Germans
of about 500 yards of terrain, mors j
than offset, it is affirmed, by the j
very heavy losses they had endured.
On the west of the river, the Ger- I
mans attacked the Avocourt block- i
house in a not less determined effort, j
but met with a complete failure, the
observers declare.
Paris. April 3. Fighting continued I
all night in the Verdun region east of
the Meuse, between Douaumont and
Vaux.
The issue turned generally, the war
office announcement of this afternoon
says, in favor of the French, who
gained ground in the northern part
of Caillette wood wThich was occupied
by the Germans yesterday. West of
the river a bombardment was carried
on near Haumont without effect.
The statement says that in yester
day's fighting the Germans lengthened
their front of attack to about three
kilometres (two miles).

here today, which was greater than
expected. Subsidence of the flood is
not expected before tomorrow by the
local weather bureau and persons in
the lowlands have again bt-en warned
to remove their livestock to higher
ground. No loss of life has been re

property damage and loss of stock in
the lowlands.
Trains over the Oenton branch of
the Missouri, Kansas At Texas railway
were detoured over t he Texas & Pa
cific today on account of the high wa
ter which came over the tracks. The
two days' cold rain has caused a con
siderable amount of suffering by cat
tle in the Panhandle section, one
rancher at Big Springs having lost
one hundred head. The sudden change
in the weather at San Angelo has
killed many newly-sheared goats and
sheep in that section. Stockmen there
estimate the loss will reach nearly
