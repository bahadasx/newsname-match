NUMBER 183
NEW SCHOOL MAY BE
BOLT ONJANGE LI
J. E. McPherson Would
Have Extra Ward Building
to Relieve Congestion.
MAP USED AS PROOF
Diagram Indicating Distri
bution Will Be Presented
to Board Tonight.
Residents of Columbia are pretty
well decided in their wish for a new
ward school, but there is difference of
opinion as to the location. It is this
problem that has led Superintendent
J. K. McPherson to plan a way to show
the people in which ward a new build
ing should be placed and why.
Mr. McPherson and others who have
considered the matter carefully have
decided that if a new building is erect- i
ed, it should be on Range line. Two
of the reasons offered are: The con
gested district Is here, and a new
building would draw the children
from the railroad neighborhood, while
children in the Guitar addrdon who
now go to the Grant School, could be
taught at the Jefferson School, which
is nearer.
The thing that should determine
the selection of the site, according to
Mr. McPherson, is the distribution of
the school children, and he intends to
show by a map prepared by the
manual arts class of this year just
where the school children live.
The map is a large one of Columbia,
divided into school districts. Each
district in turn has smaller divisions
for convenience, and the number of
children in each of these divisions is
known.
"Approximately one-half the school
children live in the First Ward, which
is in part of the Kenton School dis
trict and in the Jefferson School dis
trict," said Mr. McPherson in expla
nation of his map. "Grade five in the
Jefferson School has sixty-five pupils,
which is entirely too many for one
room. One small section of the Jeffer
son School district has 19S school chil
dren." Mr. McPherson iill present the
map, together with his conclusions as
to a new building, to the school board
at its regular meeting tonight. As
soon as all of tho figures are placed
on the map, it will be exhibited in a
downtown window, so that the public
may sec where a new building should
be placed.
No action has been taken about the
building so far, hut the matter will be
taken up soon after tlle school elec
tion, which will be tomorrow.

Tigers' Opening Game Will
Be With Westminster Col
lege Here Saturday.
TO USE NEW FIELD
Chance for Successful Team
Is Bright, Says Director
C. L. Brewer.
President A. Hoss Hill, standing in
a box at the University's new $12,000
baseball field next Saturday, will
throw the ball that is officially to open
the 191C Tiger season. The first
game of the year will be with West
minster College.
The ball game will be only one fea
ture of the festivities which have been
planned for the opening of the new
ball park. Saturday is to be a "Base
ball Day" in Columbia. Students and
Columbians are taking unusual inter
est in the summer sport, and indica
tions this season are for larger crowds
than ever before attended the Tiger
games.
Several Veterans Hack.
Missouri has been a leader In Val
ley baseball for several years. For
the last four seasons the Tiger nine
has ranked either first or second
among the Valley schools, always
making things interesting, at least, for
the ancient enemy from Lawrence.
This year, with several veterans back
and promising material from last
year's freshman and substitute teams,
Director C. L. Brewer looks for a suc
cessful season.
"Our prospects in baseball aro bet
ter than the average," said Mr. Brewer
yesterday, "and I believe, unless the
other Valley teams show unusual
strength, Missouri will rank close to
the top at the end of the coming sea
son." Of the old men back this year, there
are Captain Woody, center fielder;
Hogg, first base; Davis, third; Farm
er, shortstop, and McMillan, second.
Owen is out for left field. The pitch
er's job will be well filled if the num
ber of candidates counts for anything.
Sen Pitchers Look Rood.
While Taylor and Morgan of last
year's team are both sure of a good
try at this job, two freshmen of last
year will also be strong candidates.
Giltner, who made his M In football
last fall, was undoubtedly the star of
last year's freshmen team. He and
George Bryant, the latter a basketball
man, are slated for baseball M's be
fore the season closes.
The job most uncertain right now is
that of catcher. Lansing and Hamil
ton, both football men of 1915, are
perhaps the most promising candi
dates. Ames and Kansas Feared.
In Ames and Kansas, Missouri rec
ognizes the strongest opponents in the
Valley baseball schedule. Oakcy and
Merrill, star pitchers of the Iowa
school, are both hard at work with the
varsity squad, and, as a good pitcher
counts much in college baseball, these
two men will be Invaluable to Ames.
At Kansas.'Smee and Craig, 'star Jay
hawker pitchers, are on the job again.
Missouri's squad has been at work
since February, and for the last two
weeks has been having practice
games every day.
ATM'OOB BARRED FROM LIBRARY
Student Semite President Violated
Smoking Regulation.
William K. Atwood, a senior in the
School of Law and president of the
Student Senate, has been forbidden
the use of the Law Library for one
month, for violating the rule against
smoking.
Friday, Atwood was enjoying a
leisurely puff in the library, when he
vas discovered in the act. Since he
had previously been warned, the au
thorities pronounced sentence on him.
To Tell East of Missouri Colleges.
President James M. Wood of Ste
phens College will address a general
meeting of the National Educational
Association in New York on the "Jun
ior College" some time between July
3 and 8. Mr Wood said that the Mis
souri idea . aling with junior col
leges was attracting attention all over
the United States and that it was es
pecially significant that a man from
Missouri should talk In the East on
this subject It is expected that 40,
000 persons will attend the New York
