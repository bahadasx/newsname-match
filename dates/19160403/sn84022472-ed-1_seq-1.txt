Mexican reports hadr' It that Villa

the intention of getting the garrison of

These reports, brought here by trav

While the bandit's main command
was scattered at the battle- of Guer

several other large bodies of men Us-
posed at convenient points in the con'
tlnental divide and that Col. Dodd and
his American troops may come in con

This construction in no manner

vated frame buildings will be
more of a menace than they are

We cannot consistenly nor con
scientiously let this unwise action
on the part of your city authori

disapproval. We are disappoint-1
. ed to know that so important a
New England city as yours should
have taken so retrograding a step
when so many sister-cities in that

come the hazard which such
buildings produce.
' Bridgeport already has I more ..

than existing in August a couple
of weeks ago, but it has no wide

that stricken city. While those
streets undoubtedly aided mater

demonstration ' of the extreme
hazard which blocks of wooden '

Failure of Railroad to Adopt Automatic Train Stop
System Adopted fter Probe of Former Dis
aster is Theme of Finding of Connecticut Pub
lic Utilities Commissioners Human Element"
Bound to Err; Why Not, Then, Reinforce
Human Agencies With Infallible Mechanical
Devices?
' The report of the Public Utilities-Commission, relative to
the Milford wreck, shows that the New Haven organization is
in such a state of inefficiency
lief to the injured, s and also
in clearing the tracks.
The report says there is needed:" . ' ' '
A more efficient organization for handling wrecks
and for relief .work, to ensure proper, care of the in- .'.
jured and quicker clearing' of 'tracks for the resump- v
tion of traffic This suggestion cannot properly be
classed among those .which if carried out, would as
sist! in avoiding similar accidents, but -the , confusion ,
attending the care of the injured from a wreck occur
ring between two large cities only seventeen miles
apart, as well as the long
undamaged tracks for normal service, would seem to
be unwarranted.
v The Commission, in its finding,
sharply rebukes the New York,, New
Haven & Hartford Railroad for- its
failure to develope automatic train
stops, as suggested by the Commission
at the time of the Westport wreck. '
Says the Conrmission:
The factt in this case clearly
show that the primary cause of '
cut; uuciueuL va2s 1115 litiuie ui luc
. enginemen to obey ' the signals.
The records in this office diuclose
train accidents occurred on the '
New York, N. Haven & Hartford
. Railroad in "the last few yeara
(those at Bridgeport Westport,
Stamford, North Haven and Mil
ford) and were largely, if not en
tirely, due to man failures. In
every: case the engineman disre
garded ' and ran past signals set
against hin,ycausing derailments
or collisions with trains ahead: ,
These acts of omission or com-
mission were, of course, not wil
ful" but were incident to- univers
al hujnin fraility. and the disas
trous results -of such acts cannot
be. entirely prevented by the sub
stitution, or addition of other hu
man elements. In many cases,
however, automatic '-mechanical
jdevices provide a successful pre
ventative. : . In this connection we
iqII QTtArJti'fjTi - i-k a ri r 1 n xr -rr-w
ticular . stress upon the sugges-
tions. of our engineer pertaining
to automatic train control devices.
We feel this matter has not ibeen
given the " careful constructive
study and experimentation on the
part of the railroad company that .
' the necessities warrant, in fact,
demand. ' '
The repont alsii shows that the two
colliding trtiyns were running" but two
minutes apafc-t, and this, created a con
dition whereby the flagging rule could
Tiot give the measure of ' protection it
is designed to give, because in the
event of an' accident to the train ahead
there would not be time enough for
the flagman to go back the prescribed
distance before the following train
would be. upon him.
But one bright spot appears in the
picture. The cars, did, in the opin
ion of the commission, save many lives
and many others from injury.
The cause of the wreck is, given as
the failure of Engineer Curtiss to stop
at signals, but, it is further said, the
human element is frail, and needs the
projection of Automatic train stops.

PRESIDENT WILSON
ONLY CANDIDATE IN
MICHIGAN PRIMARY
Detroit, April 3 Michigan's presi
dential .primary law, enacted in 1912,
was given its initial trial today in
the choice of candidates who are ex
pected to figure in the national con
ventions this summer.
The Progressive party, -which swept
the state four years ago. was with
out a candidate.
Woodrow Wilson is the only Demo
cratic candidate, 'but a sharp contest
over the nomination of a , national
committeeman is expected to enliven
the balloting "of the party.
Three names are on the Republican
ballot William Alden Smith, United
States Senator, of Grand Rapids;
Henry Forsythe, of Detroit, and Wil
liam G. Smith, of Detroit.

The tracks were little Injured and.
the overhead work scarcely at all.
Nevertheless it was 4:18 before tracks!
two and four were cleared and 9:32 j
p. m. before tracks one and three were
cleared.
Failure of Engineer V.' R. Curtiss,
of the second train, to obey the sis?-
f nals was -the primary cause. Eleven
persons lost their lives and- 50 . others
were injured as a result of the ram
ming of, the Connecticut River Ex
press by a special train. Tilt findir;.-
goes on to "say: - . '
"TWo trains . involved in this acci
dent left New , Haven only two min- .
utes aparty the second - train passing
Woodmond ' signal tower (6.06 miles
west of New . Haven and near the
scene of the accident) three minutes 1
behind the first train. The close spac- '
ing of these trains has been the sub- !
ject of considerable comment1 and has !
created a feeling in the minds of soma
Lthat show as-the primary cause of the ;
acciae'nt irt not affording suffleitnt '
time for the flagman on the first train :
to go back far enough fully to'1 pro
tect his train. :
"If automatic signals properly dis
played are obeyed there is no possi-
bility ef a rear-end ' collision and if
not obeyed the flagman protecting it
might, be ,of no avail irrespective of
the spacing or time interval between
trains at the starting point. Our en
gineer calls attention' to the apparent
inconsistency between the present
"flagging rule"' and the opportunity -for
actual performance of the flag
man's duties in the "block signal sec
tions when fixed signals are disobeyed
by the engineers of following trains,
but the conrrmission does not deem it
advisable, for the reasons above stat
ed, to recommend any' arbitrary rule
governing the spacing or time interval
between trains. . .- "
The safety, of operation, the estab- (
lished means of . protection, and the
traffic necessities should be carefully :
studied by tHe officers of the railroad
company in determining the minimum
interval of time . allowed between
trains going in the.' same direction on.
the same track, keeping in mind the (
fact that while the necessities of dense j
traffic require the r!ose spacing of j
trains, the "safety of the travelling j
public should be safeguarded to the ;
fullest extent."

EJIPHASIZES NEED FOR
"" AUTOMATIC TRAIN STOPS
Washington, April 3 The Inter- ,
state Commerce Commission's report i
on the New Haven Railroad near jviii- ;
ford, Feb. 22, in which 11 were killed '
and many injured, placed the blame
on the engineer of the local train
which struck a stalled express be
cause, the report says, he failed to
regard block signals. The report adds
that the wreck again emphasizes the
need for automatic train stops.
