First Sensations of Rcpubli

ADEQUATE ARMY AND 1
NAVY ARE DEMANDED
No Delegates to Chicago Yet
Named; v Main Djscussion
Commences Late; Kuhio and
Rice or Lyman May Be the
Ticket; .Castle a Pjossibllity
As the second edition of the Star
bulletin goes to 'press the Republican
territorial ''convention . has still . to
name the territories delegates to the
RenubHcan national, convention at
Chicago. The convention did not re
assemble this afternoon until 2:45
o'clock. .
; The first development of the early
afternoon was the adoption of the
tiirf'n roll-call Instead of the secret bal
lot system In electing delegates and
, alternates. The rules committee,
' headed by H. U Holstejn, a Kuhlo
man, reported in favor of the open
roll-call. Castle suggested that the
secret ballot plan be followed to give
moYe freedom of expression by the
delegates, but the report of the rules
commltte was adopted.
Hot on the heels of this came the
report of the resolutions committee.
This brought In one of the few sensa
tions to date an emphatic denuncia
tion of the "endeavor being made to
minimize the services of Hawaiian
as members of the National GuaW,"
plainly referring to the Whltener re
part and ,the controversy It , has pro
voked. The resolution declared that
Hawalians art loyal and patriotic cltl
' zens afed e ffic I ant guardsman
; The resolutions committee's report
also Included the following:
Pledsing the -delegate to Congress
to work for statehood for Hawaii.
, Indorsing V Delegate Kuhlo- work
In Washington.
Declaring for adequate protection
for the sugar Industry and denouncing
the Democratic administration for leg
islating against - the Interests of the
industry. -
Declaring for adequate "prepared
ness" both for army and navy.
Urging that Hawaii's delegation to
the national convention be given fair
treatment in the matter of seating
with votes. ,
As the Star-Bulletin goes to press,
discussion on the resolution is. just
beginning. - V- . ' "
The big rally proposed Lfor tonight
may not materialize as many dele
gates wish to leave for their homes.
; There will be only two delegates
to the Chicago convention -this
Beems a certainty now, for this num
ler looks like the wish of the major
ity as well as of the big men of the
party. ,
Senator Charles F. Chillingworth,
chairman of the convention, makes no
secret of the fact that he is heartily
in favor of but two delegates.
; A few old wheel horses of. the party
men who have followed the work
ings of the various factlonsr-predlct
that while two, delegates proper are
chosen from the list, four alternates
will also be named instead of two,
thus making up a list of six able to
rttend the convention.
Who will the two delegates he?
This la the question that Is bothering
the majority, and in the big hall this
morning during the brief recess it
was evident that the feeling was
growing tenser every moment -
Many persons predicted excitement
r.s soon, as .the election of delegates
to Chicago Is commenced. Others be
lieved that quietness and harmory
would overrule, and that the election
would pass by without a single jar
ring note being .struck.
Several resolutions will be ' present
ed to the convention. Among these
w 111 probably be a plea for the tariff
to be grounded on good old Republi
can standards; a plea for prepared

Hawaii Judge Holds Parker

Waikoloa Ditch
CASE HARD-FOUGHT AND
MANY EXPERTS CALLED IN
Judge Matthewman Finds for
Defendant; Appeal May
Be Taken
Residents of the little village of Wal
mea, Hawaii, will, for the time being,
at least, have all the water they need
from the Waikoloa stream.
. This much has been decided by Cir
cuit Judge John A. Matthewman, who
has found for ' the defendants in the
two-year-old - case of A. W. Carter,
trustee, against the territory of Ha
waii, et al, involving the rights to the
water in the Waikoloa stream. In a
wireless message received yesterday
by Judge Antonio Perry, one of the
counsel for the territory, Judge Mat
thewman points out four distinctive
grounds upon which he based his finding.-
; " s- .r.
The suit, was begun in June, 1914,
it being the contention of the plaintiff
that the big 4 Parker Rajach had sole
right to the three "million odd gallons
of water which flowed daily in' the
Waikoloa stream. While this amount
of water is more than the stream ac
tually carries at certain periods, plain
tiff virtually laid claim to all the wa
ters of the stream. ,

REVOLUTIONISTS
(Special Cable to Liberty News.)
" TOKIO, Japan, April 3. Yuan Shih
Kai has announced that he will imme
diately xend all of the Peking troops
south to battle -with the revolutionists
around Canton. It is stated that he
will use his entire armies In Chill, Hu
pen and Shantung to force his way
through to Kwantung province.
Military men in close touch with the
situation belie e this is only another
one of the many statements issued for
fighting his way through Hunan,
Kwangsi or Kiangsi. The seaports are
in the hands of the republican troops,
and should Yuan decide to! follow this
campaign, it looks like an early vic
tory for the revolutionists.
- Republicans of China will not make
any further campaign in southern
Chma according to reports emanating
from Canton. They, are now in con
trol of the entire province of Kwan
tung, and a campaign of defense is
the move that is expected there.

charges were preferred against Gray,
accusing him of accepting bribes from

suspended by the sheriff until his
guilt was proved or disproved. The
sheriff ha& taken no action and has
declared, when questioned, that Gray
was inaccent and would not be sus

went to Cristy and asked him whether
suspension of an officer under charges
was not compulsory, or perhaps auto

but that if he wished the mayor could
suspend him.
Mayor Lane had to leave immedi
