apparent that unless "Mi ilood Citizen"
turns out in miieh larger nutnher than
has been the custom in recent pri

heads will be left to the employees uf
the city and their relatives tin the
basis of the figures given, there is no
i doubt hut that, the City llnll people.
with their immediate friends and rel
i atives, can elect a Major, a member of
the Admiuistrat ivi Hoard and a Council
favorable to their wishes.
