COLUMBUS. N. M.. April 3?
Monday, five days after the forces of
Francisco Villa began their flight
from the battlefield of Guerrero before
the victorious Americans, details
of tho pursuit aro still lacking. Military
authorities here are Inclined to
believe this means that Colonel
George A. Dodd's American cavalrymen
are still soarchlng for the bandit
loader in some remote mountain
j wilderness of Guerrero, far out of
communication with tho field base at
I Colonla Dublcn.
There wan no ofllclal confirmation
of numerous rumors of developments
in the pursuit. Among theso was one
that Villa had been captured and
another that tho bandit chiertaln, seeing
that capturo was inevitable, had
1 committed suicide.
; The stookado to bo erected here to
| confine the prisoners captured at
I Guerrero will be ot barbed wire
hanging to which will bo placed hun|
dreds ot tin cans partly filled with
pebbles. Guards to bo placed at Intervals
along tho fence would be notified
of any attempted escape by the
rattle of the pebbles In the cans.
Some apprehension wns expressed
Monday In a Jocular way that the military
authorities may be confronted
with a predicament similar to that of,
Fort Bliss officials, who In 1913 held .
5,000 Mexican rofugeos prisoner.
Word of the regular meals given the I
I prisoners soon reached their friends i
on the outside with the result that,
each morning at roll call a larger I
I number responded than had answered
the day before.

DAY HELD HI
BiGJVIVAL
W'ith the Rev. Mr. Jackson,
Virginia Evangelist, Preaching
Three Fine Sermons.
Yesterday was a red letter day at
the St. Paul's Methodist Episcopal
church, south. The llev. Frank Y.
Jackson, or Virginia, preached to
three splendid audiences. The afternoon
meeting for men only was especially
Inspiring, there being a
splendid congregation of representatlre
men from all parts of t.ho city
present. A consecration service was
held following tile sermon by Evangelist
Jackson and almost every man
I In the house gave tho preacher tils;
hand Indicating Ills Intentions to lire
nearer God and be a more efficient
servant of His.
The rtov. Jackson preached In the
evening to a capacity house, most of
the chairs bolng brought Into use. His
sermon was a marvel of clearness,
earnestness and spiritual powor. Mr.
Jackson Is a blood relative of West
Virginia's most famous son, "Stonewall"
Jackson and has much of his
Ore, enthusiasm and ability for leadership.
V
: Notwithstanding the fact that this
city has recently been visited by some
of the country's most prominent ministers
and evangelists, It now has the
opporunlty of hearing as good a series
of evangollsttc sormons as It baa
_ ever been Its privilege to hear. Mr.
Jackson 1b a master In his line and
the public cannot afford to miss this
unusual opportunity.
There will be preaching each evening
this week at 7:30 o'clock and
y next Sunday at 3 o'clock another
great muss meeting for men only.

of NEW YORK, April 3.?The boys

o- lor the first robin to return from the
i; Journeys In unknown southlands, to
id build a nest In the old apple tree,
a, and who fancifully greet the new arof
rival of an old acquaintance ore
sc probably correct In their assumption
rd that It Is the same robin, year after
year.
"There Is not the slightest doubt
but what migratory birds return to
the Immediate region year after year
for the purpose of nesting," said T.
Gilbert Pearson, secretary of tbe National
Association of Audubon riocleties,
when aske|l regarding this point.
"But Ihe ordinary, common farmland
birds, or the birds about our
villages and towns do not use last
year's nests," he asserts, smashing a
somewhat sentimental theory. "Eao
gles, ospreys and only a very few othly
er birds'make use of last year's
e- nests.
nt "The nest Is not the home of tbe
er birds. It Is only the cradle for the
'r* young, and after the young have once
