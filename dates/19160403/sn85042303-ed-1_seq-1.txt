his home and is very much pleased
with the spirit displayed in the good
roads movement throughout the sec
tion visited.
Colonel Suggs stated this morning
that the various counties which had
tried for permanent roads were more
than satisfied, 'with the investment,
and in these counties where a small
bond issue for this purpose was hard
ly possible a few years ago, the
taxpayers are willing to vote bonds
in any amounts at present for good
roads purposes.
Hunt county, especially, is progress
ing in (he good roads movement, and
is building miles and miles of the
very highest type of concrete roads.
They claim that the cost of mainten
ance of this class of road Is so much
less than ordinary gravel or dirt
roads that it pays in the end to con
struct them. Kt route home, Colonel
Suggs stopped at Gainesville and had
a conference with II. F. Johnson, of
the Commercial Club. "Mr. Johnson
is a live wire," said Colonel Suggs,
"and seems anxious to do something
for his town and surrounding coun
try. Gainesville is on the line of
the Interstate Postal Highway which
traverses this state to Fort Worth
and the gulf. Mr. Johnson and many
of the business men of Gainesville are
deeply Interested in this road, and
very anxious to see it constructed.
This Is the road formerly called the
Meridian, highway and runs from
Winnepeg to the gulf. The only rea
son that this road was not manped
more thoroughly was from the fact
that there was no bridge crossing Red
river."
"The time has come, in my opin
ion," remarked Colonel Suggs, "when
we should take up this work and
push it to a successful culmination.
Gainesville is ready, Ardmore is ready
and I believe that Marietta will do
her share toward this great move
ment. While in Gainesville, I sug
gested to several business men that
a stock company, be formed to build
a conrrete toll bridge across the river
which met with considerable favor,
r find upon investigation that, a con
crete bridge can be constructed as
cheap If not cheaper than a first
class steel bridge, and would be by
far the best advertisement that this
road could possibly receive."
Col. Suggs states that the people
all over Texas are alive, to the. ne
cessity of goods roads, and with ev
ery mile constructed, property values
along the routes increase."

der, in connection with the death of
Charles Hagerty, one of twenty per
sons who lost their lives as a result
of the dynamiting of the Ijos Angeles
Times building, October 1, l'.'lit.
Schmidt was convicted December :h,
l'.Mfi, and was sentenced January 12,
l'.'lii, to imprisonment for life in
San Quentin penitentiary. His appeal
is pending in the state district court
of appeals.
Caplau obtained a severance when
the trial of Schmidt opened. He was
refused permission to be present at
the trial.
The arrests came seemingly out of
a clear sky. Schmidt was picked r.p
on ttroadway, New York City, Febru
ary IS; 1913, and five days later, Cap
Ian was arrested at Port Orchard,
Washington, on the other edge of the
continent. Donald Vose Meserve. who
lived at Home Colony, near Port Or
chard, supplied to a detective agency
the accessary information. Home
Colony is a settlement of persons of
radical views. Caplan was raising
poultry on a small ranch he owned at
Port Orchard, Refore that he was a
barlier. For ten years he had lived
about on the Pacific coast.
A good deal of the state's case
against Caplan necessarily was
brought out at the trial of Schmidt.
It was testified that the trial of the
men who dynamited the Times build
ing was picked up at the Kerry build
ing in San Francisco where a suit
case containing telltale evidence was
found. Caplan, according to this tes
timony, was supposed to get this
suitcase from the Ferry building
check room, but somehow failed to
do so. The suitcase evidence led to
discovery of dynamite in a vacant
house; that clue ran to a powder
works and the sasistant manager of
the, powder company identified Caplan
and Schmidt as two of three men
who bought the explosive. Caplan
also was identified .is the man who
rented the house where it was found.
Two hundred witnesses were subpoe
naed by the prosecution in the
Schmidt trial, including Ortie K. Mo
Manigal, the informer, who supplied
the state much of its case against
John J. McNamara. secretary of the
International Association of bridge
and Structural Iron Workers, and
his brother, James I). McNamara.
James pleaded guilty to murder in
connection with the Times dynamit
ing, and is now serving a life sen
tence in San Quentin penitentiary.
John pleaded guilty to dynamiting
the Llewellyn Iron Works in Ixis An
geles, and is serving a fourteen-year
sentence. In general, the same wit

ICO BENEFIT
TO FARMERS
FARMERS IN THIS VICINITY ARE
NOT COMPLAINING AND WORK
IN ALL DEPARTMENTS IS WELL
ADVANCED.
With hut a few days over three
months of the year gone, the rainfall
has equaled over one-half the normal
number of inches for this section. So
far in April the rainfall has been
2.8I inches. During the month of
March 3. CI inches was recorded nt
the local observatory. There was no
ruin daring the month of February,
hnt ll.TiO inches fell during the month
of January, which makes the total for
the three months 17.90 Inches. The
normal rainfall for this section !s IM
inches, and with nearly nine months
yet to go, it looks as If the normal
figures would be passed as they were
last year.
So far, the rain has not Interfered
seriously with farm work. It has ben
efited the wheat and or.t crop ma
terially and as there is a gaod season
already in the ground the farmers
of this section have little fear of a
protracted drought. The wheat and
oat acreage in this section was de
creased to some extent over what it
was last year, hut the indications are
that peanuts will be planted in their
stead. The demand for seed has
been exceptionally heavy for this sec
tion, and it is estimated that over
l.ODD acres will be in cultivation in
the immediate vicinity of Ardmore.
