The new Juvenile Market will
kite opened about .lime 1. accord
ing to the announcement today
of K. K. Crook, assistant mv i in
C tenclent of schools, wlio lias been
I directing the home garden work.
I A site near the downtown shop-
L ping center has jirat tioally been
* , decided on.
■ The niarUet is lint one of tlie
% plans which more than 1,994
■ school children are carrying out
J in connection with the home
■ den work, in which they have
\ registered.
When you get .1,00(1 persons,
no matter how small they are,
scientifically turning their hack
yards and all available vacant lots
into garden patches, it means a
big thing for Tacoma.
' It means a big thing, too, for
Tiicoma's future citizens.
They have taken possession of
26 unsightly vacant lots.
U spells industry, enterprise
and thrift.
Thin week the boys and girls
are digging and planting. They're
going at it scientifically, too, un
* 4er the direction of instructors
who.know the business oi sowing
and ploughing.
They are diMi-fting their
working time up agaiiut
their gardens nt the rate of
i-\- cents an hour.
So whether they take their pro
' duce to the Juvenile Public Mar
ket, or sell it to their neighbors.
or turn it over for their family
consumption, they will know just
where they stand, and whether
they are making their business
l>ay. j
EVERY DETAIL OF Til KIR
WORK IS BEING KKPT OX

OUT FOR EFFICIENCY AND
RESULTS.
By June Tacoma will have the
most flourishing Juvenile Public
iMarket anywhere In the country,
