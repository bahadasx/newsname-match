kerchief. About 1200 was scattered

ed like a wild man. He roamed
through the streets of Osk Park with
the "whiskers" on bis face several
hours before robbing tbe bank. A
call waa sent to tbe police that a
"wild man" was loose and officers
were on their way to get him when

Washington, April 3. President
Wilson Is rapidly accumulating evi
dence tending to indict Germany for
recent submarine attacks on unarmed
steamers la the English channel.

affidavits have been obtained. The
new testimonials strengthened the

man submarine torpedoed the steam

Americans, and that submarines were
responsible for other recent disasters
In which citizens of this country were
endangered
The situation was again described
M critical. Tomorrow the. cabinet
I will discuss the proof already at

,have definite word of Berlin's ettl-
admission Hint there was even a bare
possibility of a torpedo causing the
explosion. . London failed to confirm
the claim that the Sussex bad once
been used as a transport. '

Rumor of Capture Was Un

That Woacds of Bandit
Are As Serious As Reported
El Paso, April 8. Fears that
Francisco Villa bad evaded the U. S.
cavalry columns sweeping the Guer
rero district were expressed by army
men today. If further search In the
wild hiding places of that region
falls to locate bfm, the Americans
will enter Parral. It Is believed be

Whether Villa's wounds are as
serious as Carranzlsta reports would
Indicate was doubted here, flince tbey
apparently have not Interfered with
his escape. .
Confirmation of Villa's reported
murders ot foreigners and constitu
tionalists at Mlnaca and Guerrero
was also awaited.
Without direct news, the border
was again a field for wild rumors.
It was stated Carranza was not co
operating as he should. American
officials scoff at reports of large de
facto 'government troop concentra
tldaa along tbe expedition's commu
nication lines. Rumors that Vllllstas
were gathering at Ascension for a
blow at these communications -were
also regarded as groundless.
Despite official forecasts that weeks
and perhaps months might elapse be
fore. Villa would be captured, the
border Is busy speculating on his
probable fate when at last he is
forced to surrender.
Consul Garcia stated that if Amer
icans should take htm, Carranza
would not claim him because the
United States would want to exact
punlBhment for the murders of Amer-
i lean citizens in his Columbus raid.
, Hut it carranzistas seize villa, tbe
de facto government plans to make
him suffer for crimes committed be

Carranzistas also believe Villa has

on reported foreign Interference In

him In order to find out where he got
his funds. ' ..; " .

Villa has already been taken, and
that General Pershing Is keeping tbe

expedition's headquarters.

alrymen today are seeking Francisco
Villa like hunters closing in on a
wounded animal. ; .
Every foot of the surrounded area
northeast ot Guerroro railroad Is be
ing searched by the swiftly-closing
ring of khakl-clad men. Owing to
the fact that no details of the chase
have been received for nenrly a week,
it la believed that Villa Is being run
down and tho situation Is so acute
there is no time for reports. Brigadier
General . Pershing went to take per
sonal command ot the scouting par

ZEPPELIN RAIDS
AROUSE BRITONS
to 'iniii"
London, April 3. Intense indigna
tion was manifest throughout tbe
British Isles today following the
third Zeppelin raid within three days
and resultant heavy fatalities.
Tbe total casualties ot the three
sky attacks are expected to reach 300
dead and wounded. Tbe public, in
hotels, in streets and in clubs, de
nounced the crew of "the Zeppelin
L-l 5, wrecked off Thames estuary,
as "baby killers.' ' People urged
that tbe captured Germans from that
Zeppelin be punished with great se
verity, as as example to other
raiders.
Newspapers discussed the treat
ment of these captives reservedly.
Public anger is likely to cause a par
liamentary Inquiry into reports that
prisoners are dining at British of
ficers' mess, each with a servant to
attend btm.
No further details of Sunday
night's raid were available early to
day. A definite list of casualties may
be Issued by the admiralty this af
ternoon. :
Simultaneously with the hurling
of death from above, German sub
marine attacks were renewed with
vigor. Four vessels were sunk In
one day and nearly 20 persons per
ished. , ; '.
The British have denied the Ger
man statement giving Berlin's ver
sion of the raid which resulted In
the ''JJ-lX Being' destroyed ""Wittl :
gard to tbe Teuton announcement, a
British government official said to
day: ; '.
. "The night was unusually clear.
It the raiders were Ignorant of lo
calities in ideal weather, how can
they hope to do military damage by
dropping Zeppelin bombs under lees
favorable conditions. The reports
that British munitions factories were
attacked and land batteries silenced
are absurd."
RELIEF STEAMER
ARRIVES IN PORT
Port Chalmers, New Zealand, April
3. Lieutenant Shackelton's auxiliary
exploring vessel, Aurora, was anchor
ed here today,1 while its crew told of
thrilling adventures amid the perils
ot drifting ice and other hardships
encountered in Ross sea.
J. R. Stenhouse became command
er of the Aurora when it broke its
moorings and went adrift last May,
leaving Captain Mackintosh and other
members ot the expedition ashore at
Cape Crosier. , With its rudder snap
ped off by ice, tho Aurora drifted
1,200 miles during ten months, firmly
gripped In a floe. ' '
The crew improvised a rudder
when their vessel was treed from the
Ice three weeks ago, then proceeded
to Port Chalmers slowly, t ...
The Aurora sailed toward, the
South Pole shortly after the Euro
pean war began, planning to meet
Shackelton In the , Robs sea after
crossing the polar regions from the
South American side. :: - -
As the relief tug came in sight of
tho weary explorers on the little ves
sel, they flashid out a wireless mes
sage, aBklng: ;
"la all well In the old country
We have had no news of he war for
U months." x '" ' ''
The New Zealand station thereupon
wirelessed latest news from the front.
While receiving this message the
Aurora's operator learned ot his
brother's death fighting the Germans.
. Bearded explorers lined tho Au
roar's rail,' cheering continuously as
the relief tug approached. They
said they had lived on the flesh1 of
seals and penguins since their vessel
.broke loose. The Mackintosh party
.was reported In the best of health
and supplied with plenty of food. ,

"Isn't it true that a copy ot tbe

'during your administration?" asked
Britten. ' ""
"I never heard of It." said Daniels,
hesitatingly. '
"You personally did not lost it?;'
"No," replied Daniels, after a long
pause. .-; :.
Afterwards, Britten eald he bad

"Do you remember having turned

. Daniels promised to do so. He.
then urged that the unamended arm
or plate bill be passed. He opposed
Butler's amendment providing that
private manufacturers be given con
tracts in case their bids should prove
satisfactory to the secretary of the
navy. '
"Armor plate dealers would not
produce unless tbey were sure of
large profits," declared Daniels. "A
price which might satisfy one secre-,

I would not be satisfied with the

corporations.";
