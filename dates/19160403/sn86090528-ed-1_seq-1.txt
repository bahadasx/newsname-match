The selection of the delegates fol
lowed the adoption of the report of
the resolutions committee, carrying
with it a resolution endorsing and in
structing for Tom Wade for national
committeeman.
When the report of the resolutions
committee came before the convention
for adoption a miniature tempest start
ed in the anti-Wade wing, led by Dr.
A. E. Henning of Tuttle, and Frank
Plato of Chickasha. This discussion
ended in withdrawal of original Wade
endorsement, Section 6, and the adop
lion of a substitute section, introduc
ed by Judge Williams, the substitute
carrying the Wade Instruction.
The time of the convention was oc
cupied for one hour and twenty min
utes in the effort to send an unln
structed delegation, led by Dr. Hen
ning, who had been defeated earlier
in the day by II. K. Ellis, of Verdcn.
for the temporary chairmanship. At
times the discussion between the
Wade and the Lafayette factions
waxed warm and the rulings of the
chair would be appealed from, while
motions and counter-motions would
bo made and withdrawn or voted
down.
The culmination of the argument
was reached when frank Plato, of the
anti-Wade faction declared that it
would be bad politics to instruct for
Wade because he. was a national bank
er and this fact, coupled with the
usury law, would result In a large de
flection of Democratic voters to the
Socialist ranks. To this assertion J.
W. Morgan, of Minco. replied in a ten
minute talk In which he stated that
any man who would desert the party
on this account was already at heart
a socialist aiid not a Democrat.
Following the remarks of Mr. Mor
gan, which were received with vocif
erous applause the vote on the Wil
liams substitute for number six of the
resolutions was taken up by precincts.
Before the roll call of precincts had
been completed, however. Dr. Hen
ning, of the anti-Wade element inter
rupted and asked that the resolution
carrying with It the Wade instruction,
be adopted unanimously. "You've got
us beat, so let's make it by acclama
tion." Dr. Henning said.
The resolutions as reported finally
And adopted follow: .
1. We express our faith In the abil
ity of the Democratic party to guaran-
tee to the people, of Oklahoma, honest
and efficient public officers and au
economic and business like aui;!"f
tration of public affairs.
2. We endorse the state adminis
tration under the honest, fearless and
able leads, Governor R. L. Williams.
We commend the administration and
its several departments for the effi
cient and conscientious administra
tion of the state's affairs, the fearless
and just enforcement of the laws, and
the able and constructive legislation
enacted.
3. We endorse the Democratic par
ty in its efforts to require corporate
wealth and public service interests to
acknowledge and obey the laws of this
state, compel every class of property

OBJECT TO
WORKING
ON ROADS
A pretty little legal battle Is on deck
ready for tho rising of the curtain this
afternoon, when it will be decided
whether or not certain prisoners fined
in the city courts and turned over to
the county, will work the county roads.
The prisoners, Dan Kelly, "Tennessee
Red" and "Baby Slim" have seen a
lawyer and state that they feel sure
they cannot be made to join the ranks
of the common herd who are at pres
ent working on certain roads of the
county under the supervision of Nim
Wyatt, foreman in charge.
They arc a bad lot," said Mayor
Coffman this morning, "and sho''d be I
made to work out their fines. Kelley
has only recently been released from
tho penal Institution at Ceuient. 'Of
course, r tho prisoneri r.in out ana
the court holds that they cannot be
sent to the county roads, they will
vork the streets or get mighty hun
gry. If they refuse to woix the streets
they will have a chance to fatten on
bread three times a day, mixed with
all the water their little hearts may
desire." . .
Oscar Simpson, who has been seen
by the prisoners, stated that the law-
was very clearly construed to mean
that prisoners might be turned over
to the county by the city and that
might be worked upon the county
roads provided they, the prisoners, did
not enter objections to working, but
that in event they did object, the
county had no authority to work them.
It was stated at the jail this morn
ing that the wagon would-be in from
the convict camp, thirteen miles east
Of Chickasha on the Chickasha-Tabler
road, this afternoon and that, unless
enjoined, tho officers would probably
escort the three obstreperous ones to
the camp.
Dan Kelley was fined $2.", Saturday
afternoon In Mayor Coff man's court
for fighting; "Tennessee Red" was
fined Friday in the sum of $2.") on vag
charges and has a prior finft of $."0
hanging over him; "Baby Slim." an
Ethiopian of lilly of the valley habits
was also jolted on Friday in the sum
of $23 on vag charges.
Chas. Crisp, fined $."0 for fighting,
on Saturday afternoon, has paid his
fine and been released from cntory.

DAUGHTER
OF WILSON
IS WINNER
Margaret Brings Opponents into Line
Just Like Papa in Fight With Mem
bers of Conservative Wash
ington School Board
By United Presa.
Washington, April 3 President
Wilson's daughter, Miss Margaret
Wilson, is showing Washington today
that her father is not the only mem
ber of the White House family gifted
with powers to bring congressmen
and such Into line.
Miss Wilson for ;c?ie months has
been engaged in a battle of politics
with Washingtos's Roard of Educa
tion, a conservative inmftu''on ap
pointed by courts and not responsible
to the people. Her battle is about to
come to a successful conclusion In the
House, where Representative Johnson
of Kentucky has introduced a bill in
tended to bring the board into lino,
broaden the schools' field of useful
ness and add another scalp to the al
ready large Wilson collection.
Mi-sis Wilson have advanced ideas
abmt a city. She believes school
houses may be used to advantage by
grown folks as community centers,
civic forums R"d such. The people
were in favor of it, all along.
Finally, Representative Crosser of
Ohio Introduced a bill providing that
school houses might be used as civic
centers. Senator Hollls sponsored the
bill in the Senate. Permission was
granted for mothers and fathers to
meet at the schools to discuss school
affairs, politics, war, and if they want
ed to, fashions. Citizens' associations,
of which there are about seventy-five,
also made use of them.
In the Grovor Cleveland school, one
of the first to take advantage of the
(law, the people decided to meet on
Sunday afternoons. The Board of Ed
ucation didn't sec It that way. If
there were to be any meetings, tho
board said, it the Board would say
w hen they were to be held.
Miss lyilson went right up and saw
the congressmen about it. She didj't
have to go any farther than Johnson
of Kentucky, chairman of the District
committee.
Early in March (l!Mfi) the Board of
Education waked up to find that Con
gress was by way of passing a bill
which said that ten schools, in given
sections, should be named as conimu
ntiy forums.
Further, the hill said specifically
that the people in the sections, if they
wanted to organize, could go right
ahead. Whey they were organized,
the hill went on, they were to name
the time and place of meeting. The
Board of Education, left to hold the
sack, was told it was made responsi
ble for the plan, and that its duty lay
in seeing that nothing went wrong
with the plan. j
All the Board has to do is jump right
up and say, "Yes. sir" when a properly-organized
section voices a desire to
meet at the schoolhouse. The bill it
self looks innocent enough. It says,
in parenthesis, that it was introduced
"by request."

the visitors in the city today.

'Slipped Collar and Crawled Under Fence"
is Comment of Funston; Troops Hin
dered in Search by False
information
Ey United Press.
San Antonio, Tex., .April 3 "It isl
my belief that Villa has slipped the
collar and crawled under the fence."
This was Gen. Funston's comment to
day on the progress of the Mexican
man hunt.
The American troops are said to be
greatly hampered in the search by
false information given by Mexicans.
It is believed that the American col
umns are near Chihuahua today but
there was no report from Pershing
and no definite news from other
sources.
The roads south of Casas Granites
i are reported to be much improved.
Five powerful automobiles are being
used im couriers between El Valle and
i the extreme front. Twenty Apache
1 scouts, the greatest trailers in the
world, will go to the front next week
to track the outlaw.
By United Press.
El Paso, Tex., April 3. It is feared
this morning that Villa has eluded his
American pursuers.
Unless the bandit leader is located
soon the search in the territory about
Guerrero will be abandoned and the
Parral district to the south will be in
vaded. It is considered quite likely
that he is headed in that direction
where he has many sympathizers.
That Villa was seriously wounded as
reported by official Carranza sources
is beginning to be doubted. Wild ru
mors of I.Kk of Carranza co-operation
in the chase are officially discredited.

day were deserters from the commam
of Col. Cano's Carranzistas. Official

reports, believing that the men were
only individual desertions to the forces
of Villa.

worrying already concerning the com

stress on the fact that relief from

more important than even the greatest
military gains.

As a matter of fact, it is asserted,

urged to consider that the importance
of a good crop this year is sufficient
to warrant even the temporary re
lease ot men from military duty If
they are needed on the farms.
