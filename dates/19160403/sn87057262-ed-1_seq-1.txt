I'hether Villa's wounds were as ser

PROUD OF BOATS.
[By Carl W. Ackerman, United Press

BERLIN, April 3.—The aussex af
fair Is arousing little apprehension in
Berlin with regard to German-Ameri
can relations.
The tension apparent during the
Lusitania and Arabic negotiations is
utterly lacking. This is. chierty due to
the popular conviction that the Sus
sex was mined, not torpedoed, though
It Is pointed out that she formerly
was In service as a British transport
and might, through error, have been
so regarded by a boat commander.
The Increased activities of the
boats has created a most favorable
Impression among the German people.
1 he newspapers declared today that
since the new campaign against arm
ed merchantmen opened March 1,
submarines have sunk enemy ships
with a total tonnage of 72,000. It Is
estimated that enemy ships with a
totaT tonnage of 15,000 have been sunk
by mines in the same period.
POLITICAL POT
BEGINS TO BOIL
Interest Centered in Primaries to
Elect Delegates In Three of
the States.
WASHINGTON, April 3. With
only sixty-four days to go before the
republican convention, three states,
important to G. O. P. success, will
hold primaries this week to elect 143
delegates. They are New York,
wfiose eighty-seven delegates, politic
ians here say, will go uninstructed
Michigan, whose thirty votes will go
to William Alden Smith, and Wiscon
sin, where LaFolIette and Governor
Phillpp are engaged in a bitter con
test.
The belief is general here that the
net result will be to continue the ap
parent swing toward Hughes and
Roosevelt although the names of
neither will appear on the primary
ballots.
In Wisconsin, LaFolIette Is seeking
a personal delegation to Chicago.
Governor Philipp Is fighting for an
uninstructed group. But the real
fight, it Is thought here, Is between
the liberal followers of LaFolIette and
the victorious "stalwarts" who swung
Governor Philipp into office.
Members of the Michigan delega
tion here believe sentiment In their
state is almost equal as between
(Roosevelt and 'Hughes and that the
situation which develops at the con
vention, will decide the final course
of the men elected.
New York is thought to be similar-

Recent Attacks on Unarmed
Vessels by Sub

SITUATION IS SERIOUS
Cabinet Will Meet Tomorrow to Con

Law.
[By Robert J. Bender, United Press

WASHINGTON, April 3.—President
Wilson is rapidly accumulating evi
dence tending to indict Germany for
recent attacks on unarmed vessels in
the English channel.
Word of new affidavits has reached
this country, it -was learned today..
The additional evidence materially
Increases the strength of opinion pre
vailing In administration circles that
a German submarine was responsible
for the attack on the Sussex and other
vessels, jeopardizing American fives.
The situation today was again de
scribed as "very serious.''
The cabinet will meet tomorrow to
take up the additional proofs received
by the state department. It is possible
by that time definite word as to Ber
lin's attitude on the Sussex and other
channel attacks will be at hand, In
view of a cable from Gerard stating he
anticipated an early reply to this gov
ernment's inquiry.
The suggestion that the Sussex may
have been torpedoed in the belief that
she was a British transport, contain
ed in -exclusive BerHn dispatches to
the United Press, proved of greatest
Interest to the state department offi
cials today.
It was the flrst admission from Ber
lin that the Sussex may have been a
submarine victim. All previous dis
patches had insisted that the Sussex
struck a mine.

Sussex formerly was engaged as a car

PARIS, April 3.—By successful
counter attacks, French troops
gained ground last night in the Call
ette woods, southeast of Fort Douau
mont, the war office announced this
afternoon.
The counter attacks were of great
violence and brought to a halt the
German offensive delivered in this
region by a force estimated at 20,000
men. The Germans apparently were
attempting to drive southward, plan
ning to surround Fort Vaux, which
has resisted successive massed at
tacks by the Germans since the early
days of the Verdun fighting.
On the west bank of the Meuse, the
Germans bombarded Haucourt and
Esnes throughout the night. The
French guns on Hill 304 replied
energetically.
In yesterday's fighting, the Ger
mans advanced on a front of nearly
two miles. The whole sector between
the ruins of Fort Dowaumont and the
Vaux brook was the scene of desper
at fighting.
By hurling mass after mass at the
French trenohes, the Germans foroed
their way across the Vaux-Douaumont
road. Then, sheltered from machine
gun fire by a slight rlse^ they ad
vanced into the northern fringes of
Cailette wood.
Further south, near Vaux village,
the German charge was met by a
sheeted fire that broke the grey ranks
In confusion. The French shattered
the German front with artillery and
machine gun fire from behind re
doubts on the highway leading west
ward from Vaux.
In the Woevre region, the night
was calm. In Lorraine, a German
reconnaissance was repqulsed.
A German war plane fell behind
the French lines near Moyen and Its
occupants were captured.

No German report on the sinking
of the British cruiser of the Donegal
class, a vessel of 9,«00 tons, has been
received in the United States. It is
possible the statement was held up
by the naval censors at the Sayville
and Tuckcrton wireless stations.

Third Air Raid in Three Days Causes Great
Wave of Indignation to Sweep Over
Great Britain.
HEM LOSS OFJJFE IS EXPECTED
On Sunday Night, Air Ships Hovered Over Scot
land for the First Time and Killed
Many People.
[By Wilbur S. Forrest, United Press
Staff Correspondent]
(LONDON, April 3.—A great wave
of Indignation swept England today
following the third Zeppelin raid
with, heavy loss of life among non
combatants In seventy-two hours.
Demands for extreme punishment
for the crew of the Zeppelin I-rlfi
captured off the mouth of the Tliames
early Saturday were heard on every
side. The newspapers exercised the
greatest restraint In discussing the
possible fate of the prisoners. In the
clubs, the hotels and on the streets
they were denounced as "bsiby kill
ers" and it was urged that the gov
ernment should make an example of
them.
Reports that the Zoppelin officers
are bfeing served from the ftrltlsh of
ficers' mess table with a servant as
signed to each, particularly aroused
the public's anger. It seems certain
that the government will be inter
rogated on this point In parliament.
Details of the Sunday night raid,
tbe first In which the coast of Scot
land has been visited, were still
lacking early today, but the war of
flee expected to make an announce
n'.ent of casualties this afternoon. It
is believed certain that the casual
ties in the three raids will total near
ly 300 In dead and wounded.
The Zeppelin attacks were gener
ally coupled in the popular mind with
the renewal of submarinines both in
Filtish waters and in the Medltcr
rean. Four more vessels have been
sunk in the last twenty-fouc hours
with the loss of nearly twenty lives.
Authoritative denial was made to
day of t'he truth of the official Ger
man statement regarding the Friday
night raid in which the L/-15 was shot
down.
"It was unusually clear Friday
night," said an official. "If the Ger
mans showed such ignorance of the
localities they visited tinder ideal
weather conditions, how can they
hope to do military damage by Zep
pelin raids tinder less favorable con
ditions.
