.Charles M. Healey, proprietor of the
rooming house at 210-212 East Wash
ington street, from which twenty
seven registrations for the city elec
tion of tomorrow were made, is
wanted by the police. ,A felony
warrant issued late yesterday after
noon, charging Ned Creighton'B
friend from Des Moines with having
procured an illegal registration, had
not been served up to midnight, de
spite every effort on the part of the
police to locate Healey. Every place
where it was thought Ije might be in
the city, and several places outside I
or .town were visueu, nut no trace
of the man could be found. Inquiry
at the rooming house brought only
the information that "he left at 10
o'clock this morning t go out in
the country for. the day."
The issuance ..of a.. warrant for
Healey followed an extended inter
view with Edwin Olsen, a waiter em
ployed at the White House restau
rant, and who for a time was a
guest at Healey's rooming house.
Healey made a new affidavit, one
considerably more far-reaching than
the one he signed in Ned Creighton's
office on Saturday in the, presence
of Healey and which appeared in
the Gazette that afternoon. On the,
strength of this new affidavit a com
plaint was sworn to before City Mag--istrate
"-, McBide who thereupon is
sued a warrant.
According to the statement of Ol
sen he. was - urged and - advised by
Healey to register, notwithstanding
that he (Olsen) told Healey that he
had been In Arizona less than seven
ty days. Olsen says that Healey ac-

rected him to the table of J. P. Han
nan, a registration clerk, and left the
city hall with him after he had reg
istered. Olsen exhibited his registra
tion oaper bearing the name of Han
an as deputy.
; If Healey was in Phoenix last even
ing, and there were those who said
he was and would appear "at the
proper time," he managed to keep his
whereabouts well to himself. That
he should have absented himself from
his rooming house all day and far
into the night, was something that
no person seen at the rooming house
could explain. It was contrary to his
usual custom. In leaving he is not

It was under the following clause
from the Arizona statutes that the
charge was made and the warrant
for Healey issued: ,
Title IV. "Of Crimes Against the
Elective Franchise" Par. 35: Every
liprson 'who wilfully causes, procures
or allows himself to be registered, as
an elector in any county, city or
precinct, knowing himself not to be
entitled to such registration, and any
officer who wilfully enters the name
of any person not entitled to regis

electors, is punishable by a fine not
exceeding one thousand dollars, or by
imprisonment in the state prison not
exceeding five years, or by . both such
fine and imprisonment. In all cases
where, on the trial of a person charg
ed with any offense under the pro
visions of this section, it appears in
evidence that the accused stands reg

must order such registration to be

The Germans "are still carrying on

COLUMBUS, N. M., April 2. North
from the town of Guerrero and east of
the line of the Mexico Northwestern
railroad-, through arroyos. and over
trails that lead through the buttes and
canyons of the Sierra Tarahnmare,
American cavalrymen of the Seventh
regiment are riding night and day seek
ing Francisco Villa, according to latest
reports received from field headquar
ters at Colonia Dublan.
Little information concerning the
pursuit filtered over the border today,
and nothing definite was received from
official sources. There were reports,
however, that the forces of Colonel
Dodd had captured the man who was
once the "Robin Hood" of Mexico, but
because of the difficulty in communica-
lion, have been unable to make a
port. Late advices from the camp 0f
General J. i. Pershing, at the front, '
stated that the track of a vehicle be-
lieved to be the carriage carrying Villa
in his flight has been discovered.
Other advices said that the American
cavalrymen were riding through the
mountains m the teeth f a heavy gale.
but that nofa single man indicated a
desire to give up the search.
Army men here were considerably
disturbed today by numerous warnings,
from confidential sources that Villista
adherents are gathering in the Chi
huahua desert, both north and south of
Ascension and near the motor trail
leading from Columbus to Casus Grau-
des, for the punose of attempting to
cut the American line of communica
tion. An extra heavy guard of infantry
men, with specific, instructions in the
event of an attack, was placed on a
truck train which left here for the
front today. Isolated camps of soldiers
guarding the line were reported by the
field telegraph and ordered to watch
closely for signs of hostile forces. Lieu

base, left on the train for Colonia Dub

There is no indication here that

The question of the loyalty of the
Carranza troops has agfain come very
much to the fore here following per
sistent reports that Col. Cano, Car
