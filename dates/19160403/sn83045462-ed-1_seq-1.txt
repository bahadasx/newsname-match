ZEPPELIN RAIDERS
COVER WIDE AREA
OVERBRITISH SOIL
Scotland and Eastern Counties
of England Visited in
Sunday's Incursion.
TEN PERSONS KILLED
AND ELEVEN INJURED
Fifty-Nine Reported Read, 166
Wounded Friday and
Saturday.
RUNKIRK IS ALSO SHELLERj
Berlin Claims Great Damage Has
Been Done to Industrial Works
in English Cities.
LONDON, April 3.?Zeppelins
raided eastern Scotland and the
northeastern and eastern counties
of England from 9 o'clock last
night to after I o'clock this morning,
in the third great raid by the
German air fleet in as many
nights.
The latest raid is "known to
have been over a wide area.
Ten persons were killed and
eleven injured in Scotland in Sunday
night's Zeppelin raid, it was
officially announced this afternoon.
There were no casualties
in England.
In Friday and Saturday night's
raids fifty-nine persons were
killed and 166 wounded.
Berlin's account of the Saturday
and Sunday nights' raids declare
that blast furnaces, large
ironworks and industrial plants
on the Tees and on the port establishments
of Middlesborough
and Sunderland, were hit, inflicting
heavy damage and causing
explosions to occur and fires to
break out.
The French city of Dunkirk on
the Straits of Dover also has suffered
a Zeppelin attack, an airship
dropping three bombs which
killed two civilians.
Third Hecent Raid.
The raid was the third in as many
successive nights. Raiders reached the
coast of Scotland?the first time they
had been over that country and the
farthest north Zeppelins had yet traveled.
Other raiders visited northern
and southeastern counties of England.
Inhabitants In the threatened districts
early last night heard the Zeppelins
were expected. The weather was
strain ideal for raiders and the people
v. ere not surprised w hen at 11 o'clock
the lights were extinguished and surface
and railway traffic was stopped.
Special constables were called out and
the same precautions were taken as on
the two previous nights.
Show No Signs of Panic.
A remarkable feature of the situation
was the good-natured way in which
the people acted in the darkened and
stalled trains, showing no signs of
panic despite the fact that they had
Just learned the result of the previous
raids. They seemed to take their inconvenient
e as a matter of course.
In London no formal notice is given
the people when a raider is about, but !
\arious customary precautions make
It impossible for any one who is in
town to be in doubt as to what is up.
In villages in many parts of England
it is the custom to give the inhabitants
mpie warning, when it is possible.
Special constables go from door to door,
informing the villacrers that raiderw are
on the way. The Inhabitants assemble
In one another's houses, in the street
and in public buildings, making the
visit something in the nature of a social
event.
Although the hour the Zeppelins visited
most of the towns Sunday night
was late, many thous&afls of persons
were waiting to catoh a glimpse of
them. In most cases the visitors flew
so high that it was almost impossible
to distinguish them, except when
searchlights brought them out clearly
against the sky. In some places, how- {
ever, they flew low and were clearly j
seen by everybody. .
Saturday's Casualties.
At least sixteen persons were killed
and more than on" hundred others injured
by the explosion of bombs dropped
in another raid of Zeppelin
dirigible balloons over the northeast
coast of England Saturday night.
The official version of the raid says:
"Two airships approached the northeast
coast Saturday night. Only one
crossed the coast. The other turned
ba<k.
"Kor th" present we know that sixteen
persons were killed and about
one hundred injured.
"Eight dwelling houses were demolished
and a serious fire was caused in a
French polishing shop."
Story of Damage Done.
A correspondent in a northeast coast
town says that a Zeppelin was sighted
there at 11 o'clock Saturday night. It
drnnriPii fourteen exnloalve onH eovan
incendiary bombs. Ten men, three
women and three children were killed
and twenty-five persons were seriously
injured. In addition, about eighty
others received minor Injuries.
A tram car inspector was killed and
a woman tram conductor suffered the
loss of a 1*r blown off. Several houses
were wrecked in one street. One house I
was demolished, but the family of five
escaped without serious injury. j

"Cuts Loose" in Sermon at

Visits White House With Ma Sunday
and Then Goes to Annapolis
to Address Midshipmen.
Billy Sunday "cut loose" at the
Baltimore Conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church in
Foundry M. E. Church this
morning-, with his own peculiarly
popular and picturesquely pithy
phraseology. He preached his
sermon on "The Arrow." and
when he had finished, panting
and hoarse, the audience that
packed the church called for
"More, More." He told them he 1
must stop to keep an appointment 1
at the White House and so that 1
he could get to Annapolis to ad- ;
dress the midshipmen. 1
Then there were cries for "Ma" Sunday,
and she was escorted to the lectern
by Bishops Earl Cranston and T. S.
Henderson. In response to requests that 1
she speak she said: "Whatsoever He j
says unto you do, thou do it."
In his closing prayer Mr. Sunday be- '
sought heaven that all the forty-two r
centimeters of hell may not make a j
dent in the battle line of Christianity.
In response the conference and guests 1
prayed th&t God may inspire and bless
his mission.
1
Visit the White House.
Billy and Ma Sunday visited the
White House at 12 o'clock and shook 1
hands with the President. Mr. Sunday i
chatted about his revival services in
Trenton, X. J., where the President *
lived while governor. They were <
luncheon guests of Mrs. Sunday's niece, 4
Mrs. Douglas Weart, at the Northumberland.
The party came to Washing- *
ton in the private car of the president
of the Washington. Baltimore and An- j
napolis railway, and left the station at
14th and New York avenue on the return
trip for Annapolis at 2 o'clock.
"I am always glad to answer the call
of Methodism." said the evangelist;
"my Ma is a Methodist." 1
Talking in allegorical style, his voice t
harsh and strained from overexertion, s
he told the story of Ahab and Jehosaphat.
He indulged in very plain lan- 1
guage, stringing his descriptive no- l
menciature in denunciation of sin- ]
ners into long, periodic construction ,
that left him completely winded.
He described two classes of people 1
in the church?some who want to
know the will of God, so that they can i
do it; others who are in the church for j
the loaves and fishes and care nothing i
for what God thinks about lying, booz- j
ing, etc. ,
"If a minister tears off the mask of y
their hypocrisy, if he even mentions ,
hell Are and brimstone, these have '
nervous prostration," he said. j
Breaks Desk With Fist. ]
"It is not good to have a synonym
for sin," was one of his aphorisms.
The booze fighter is a sinner, no matter
what they want him called. They
cannot save the thief by calling him a 1
kleptomaniac, nor the adulterer by 1
speaking of an affinity. In emphasiz- 1
ing how the worshippers of today will
cry "Crucify him!" and howl against a <
preacher who tells them plainly of ]
their sins, Mr. Sunday pounded so hard
on the desk that he broke the top off.
He threw it to the platform at one side
ami continued his excoriation. 1
"Oh. you mutt," "gin guzzlers," "get f
in the game." "spindle legged dude." 3
"tin horn, boot licking, sycophantic, 'L
milk and cider, chalk and vinegar re- j
ligion" and "going to hell so fast they t
are breaking the speed limit" were t
some of the expressive characteriza. ,
tions employed by the evangelist. *
Usually these epithets were so strung
out that even close listeners had difficulty
to keep up with the rapid fire
vernacular.
"It isn't the truth a lot of foreflushers
in your pews want today," he said. c
"What they want is some authoritative
person td tell them they'll be saved i
no matter how they live, wlften God
has said that they'll be damned in hell J
If they continue to live as they want to. <
Can't Get Away From Truth. ^
"The people don't get mad because j
the preacher talks plain?it's because ,
they can no longer delude themselves i
after they've had the truth. You can't i
get away from the truth as Abab tried J
to by locking up God's messenger. t
"If you are a transgressor God'a aveng- ^
ing angel is on your track and God s
avenging arrow is aimed at your heart."
Again he admonished the preachers:
"Jesus Christ intended the church should
be militant. You must fight as well as
preach and pray. A man without a temper
is a man without force. The prophets
all carried big sticks. Strong men resist,
weaklings compromise.
"1 am asked if a man should go around <
with a chip on his shoulder. I mean he
should have the spirit to stake all. even
life, for what he knows to be right. If
we hadn't been willing to fight for right
we'd have been singing 'God Save the
Kins' instead or I ne &iar spangled
Banner' and 'Nearer, My God, to Thee.
Scores Sabbath Violators.
He paid his respects 1n common language
to the "God-forsaken gang of foreign
thugs are debauching the Lord's
day and tearing down all our sacred
institutions." He said no spirit of
neutrality should be preserved in dealing
with them?if they did not take
kindly to our zeal for a holy Sabbath,
they should be told to "beat it back to
their own dunghill while the wind is <
with them."
Another of his aphorisms was "For
every dare-devil there ought to be a
dare-saint." I
He also told some things not worth :
scrapping about: ,
"The < rusaders were great," he said,
"but they fought for an empty tomb.
"It doesn't make any material difference i
whether a preacher wears a coat or a
black nightgown when he's preaching the ,
word of God; nor whether he buttons his
collar in the back or front."
As an inspiration to preachers, he said:
'Wesley took dry-as-duat philosophy and

FIGHT HAGES ALL NIGHT
Effort Made to Counteract Crown
Prince's Successes Yesterday?Attempt

Bush Fortress.
LONDON", April 3.?Heavy
nasses of troops are still being
lurled by the Germans against
:he defenses of Verdun, which
ire being tested to the limit at
cital points.
The French are offering tena:ious
resistance, and, according
:o Paris, have succeeded in pressing
back the crown prince's
forces between Yaux and Douaunont,
where sledge-hammer blows
tad badly dented the French
ines within the past few days.
The gain claimed is in the
northern part of the Caillette
.vood, which the Germans occunied
yesterday. Desperate fightng
continued there all last night,
ind the general result was favorible
to the French, today's bulletin
asserts, additional ground in
the northern part of the wood beng
reclaimed.
New Phase of Battle.
A new phase of the battle of Verdun
las begun and the belief prevails that
:he violence of the latest attacks foreshadows
another attempt by the Gernans
to rush the fortress with vast
forces. New batteries of large caliber
have been moved up closer to the
French front and the German infantry
n>? haan r*??t#?d and reorganized.
Yesterday's fighting on the whole was
not unfavorable to the French, it is
authoritatively stated. The object of
the Germans was to clear the approaches
to Fort Douaumont, and 15,)00
men j^ere thrown forward on the
mile and a half line between Douaumont
fort and the village of Vaux.
The attacking force succeeded in crossing
a little ravine which hitherto had
stopped them and in entering the Caillette
wood.
Dislodged From Vaux.
Farther cast they dislodged the
French from the last ruined houses of
the village of Vaux, but the French
positions were so placed as to make it
practically impossible for the Germans
to debouch from the village. Vigorpus
French counter attacks drove them
back to the upper fringe of Caillette
wood.
The total result of the very formida>le
effort tiiey had put forth was a
;a in for the Germans of about 500
ards of terrain, more than offset, it is
iffirmed, by the very heavy losses they
lad endured. On the west of the river
he Germans attacked the Avocourt
blockhouse in a 110 less determined
manner, but. again met with complete
'ailure, the observers declare.
French Communication.
The text of today's French communi:ation
follows:
To the west of the River Meuse the
pombardment has continued at the vilages
of Haucourt and Esnes, but with>ut
any action of infantry.
"To the east of the Meuse the flght
ng wnicn went on last rngni in tne region
of Douaumont and Vaux was favorable
to us. We gained ground in the
wood of Caillette. Our line rests on the
-ight of the pond of Vaux, then crosses
he Caillette wood, the northern corner
>f which is occupied by the enemy and
-ejoins our position to the south and
vest of the village of Douaumont.
Move Forward in Waves.
"It has been confirmed that the attacks
of the enemy yesterday were extended
over a front of three kilometers.
They came forward in successive
waves, followed by small columns. The
activity of our artillery and the fire of
our Infantry caused heavy losses in the
ranks of the enemy.
"In the Woevre district the night
passed quietly.
"In Lorraine the fire of our artillery
caused flames to break out at Les
Itemabols, to the west of Leintrey, and
in the region of Ancerviller, to the
south of Blarnont.
"The reconnaissance of the enemy
which was attempting to reach our
positions was repulsed by our fire at a
point near Moyen.
"A German aeroplane has fallen within
our lines. The aviators were taken
prisoner."
Yesterday's Battles.
In describing the tremendous battles
of yesterday the French official statement
of last night says:
West of the Meuse the Germans
launched several powerful attacks on
n. corner of the Avocourt wood. All
the assaults were repulsed by our barrier
Are and the Are of our machine
guns.
"To the east of the Meuse the action
was very spirited throughout the day
In the region of Douaumont and Vaux.
The Germans, after a bombardment of
extreme violence with shells of heavy
caliber, directed four simultaneous attacks

one division on our positions between ]
Fort Douaumont and the village of

they penetrated Calllette wood, but our j
counter attacks, delivered immediately, (
drove them back in the northern part I
of the wood. South of Vaux our line \
runs along: the immediate outskirts of
the village, the last ruined houses of
which we have evacuated."
Four Brigades Used a? Vaux.
Four fresh brigades participated in i
the German attack which ended in the '
occupation of the village of Vsrax, to,
the northeast of Verdun, says an eyewitness
of the battle. The assault began
with a night attack which is becoming
more and more preferred by
the Germans. All Friday evening the
village and Its surroundings were co- |
piously shelled.
The attack began from the north at
3 o'clock in the morning by a brigade
debouching from trenches on the hillside
east of Fort Douaumont and advancing
as far as the railroad line in -1
front of th?\ advanced French position, J
where it was checked by French infantry
and a barring fire which was so
intense that the assailants were unable
to hold their ground. They retired
to their trenches much depleted
in numbers.
Fight Amid Ruins.
I J!
It was a fresh brigade which made t
the second attack toward 5 o'clock in v
the morning. It came from the east t
with an abundant supply of powerful g
grenades that demolished the houses t
occupied by the defenders of the town. f
Though partly burjed under the ruins, i
the French stuck stubbornly to their
posts, which they resigned only step
by step, and inflicted severe losses on
the attacking force.
With the houses demolished by grenades
and shells, there remained no j
reason for maintaining the position, I
and the French were ordered to retire
011 positions prepared farther to the
west. The detachment still maintained 1
a galling fire as it went back slowly 1
and in good order, a curtain of French X
shell fire keeping the Germans from 1
pursuing. 1

Task Becoming More Difficult.
The absence of any official nows from
the front since the defeat of the Villa
band near Guerrero by Col. Dodd last
Wednesday has considerably dashed
the hopes of those who saw in the
victory the beginning: of the end of
the bandit's career. At the same time
It Is pointed out that the American
cavalrymen have a formidable task before
them in searching the barren
mountain wastes where Villa is supposed
to have taken refuge. The fart
that no further fighting has been reported
is taken as an indication that
the bandits have been effectually scattered
by the American troopers.
As usual, in the lack of definite information,
the border is again a hive
of rumors of an alarming and sensational
character. The majority of these
rumors are based on stories brought
from the interior by Mexicans and the
few Americans who straggle in here
by ones and twos daily. The most circumstantial
of these stories at present
deals with the reported defection
of Col. Carao, the Carranza commander
at Namiquipa.
Cano Herrer&'s Chief Lieutenant.
Cano is the chief lieutenant of Gen.
Luiz Herrera, who was supposed to
have declared against Carranza several
days ago, a report that was vigorously
denied by the officials of th?
de facto government.
The main facts in support of Cano's
revolt are that he has not been heard
from for more than a week and that he
is known to have expressed strong
anti-American sentiments on several
occasions. Like Herrera, Cano has
been a bitter enemy of Villa, and it is
not supposed that if he has deserted
"tonHariI ftf fh# flrst chief, he has
joined the fugitive bandit, but that he
has simply declared himself against
any co-operation with the soldiers of
the United States.
A good deal of significance is attached
to the fact that while Gen. Gavira
and Consul Garcia insist that they are
convinced of Cano's loyalty, they admit
that they have had no communication
from him or from his immediate
superior. Gen. Bertani, for some time.
Up to a week ago Gen. Gavira claimed
that he was in receipt of dally telegrams
from both Bertani and Cano.
Border Troop Movements Mysterious
There Is something- of a mystery
attached to the movement of Mexican
troops at points close to the border.
It is known that large bodies of Carranza's
soldiers have been moved from
samps in the interior to various places
within twenty miles of the international
line, but no explanation has
been given of these maneuvers beyond
a general intimation that the de facto
government is anticipating possible
action by the followers of Felix Diaz,
who is now considered the head of the

Is lacking on both questions. Jf
I Villa has escaped from the Guerrero
district and is pushing south toward

problems have been Increased
greatly. Since the fight at Guerrero
last Wednesday, in which the Villa
force was routed, the American troops
have been engaged in making a
thorough search for the bandit in the

Gen. Funston has received messages
bearing on the activities of Carranza
troops, but these were not made public.
However, it was indicated at headquarters
that their co-operation has not
been active.
Long and Dogged Chase

by Some Army Officers
News regarding the operation of the
United States forces in Mexico was
awaited with intense interest in official
circles today.
Messages of only a routine character
have reached the War Department from
the border since the official report of
the route of the main column of Villa's
outlaws by Dodd's cavalry and the information
that the elusive bandit chieftain
himself was said to be seriously
wounded and in hiding.
While the early capture of Villa ie
looked for in official quarters, some
army officers fear that failure to take
him at the Guerrero flght may result in
a long and dogged cha6e.
No Trace of Felix Diaz.
Latest reports from commanders of
warships in Mexican waters say that
no trace of Felix Diaz, reported to be
in Mexico at the head of a new revolution,
had been found. The protocol
with the Carranza government, designed
to cover all questions relating
to the hunt for Villa, Is expected to be
concluded during the week.
Reports that Col. Cano had deserted
Gen. Carranza and joined Villa's bandit
forces with his command, or a part
of it, were credited today by officials
of the State and War departments, and
it was stated authoritatively that while
official Intimations that Cano had revolted
had been received here, no actual
confirmation had come.
