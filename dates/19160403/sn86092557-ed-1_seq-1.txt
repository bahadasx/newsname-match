RIDE IS MAI Eli
Col. Dodd Will Be Retired
On Ag-e Next
July.
17 HOURS III SADDLE
Regarded As One of the
Most Efficient Cavalry
Commanders.
EL PASO, Texas, April It.?"Tliis
chap whc put Bandit \ ilia on the ruu
must be a spry young fellow." is what
Mr. Average American probably said
when be read of Dodd's ride mode bv
Col. George A. Dodd when he routed
the bandit. Villa, at San Geroninmo
ranch.
"This chap who stuck to his saddle
IT hours straight, made a 55-mile dash
into Mexican Jungles, with ten miles
ot it a running battle, must have youth
and (ire and an iron constitution."
But Col. Dodd. though ho may be
spry, isn't young. "The man ot the
hour" In the Mexican invasion is six
ty-four.
He has been in the army 35 years.
In Jul.v he will have reached the age
limit (>r military service and will be
retired.
Retirement for "age-limit" cannot
dim the glory that closes the fighting
days of the veteran cavalry man. To
die fighting Is a fate to which any sol
dier may look forward, but to retire
at the close of a campaign that would
have daunted the courage, and tested
the endurance of youth, is a triumph
that comes to few fighting men.
Col. Dodd is not a stage hero?the
"movies' will never catch him. He
is a . soldier, picturesque In his way.
the type of man Remington loved to
paint. He Is iron-nerved, steol-mus
cled and clear-minded.
Except "Black Jaclc" Pershing, the
daredevil of the cavalry, there is no
more daring rider-in the army than
Col. Dodd. ' ' '' ' V
The man who routed Villa ..In* the
man *ho-'ptIHI!P^SBJasrflHIFinto
the. United States< cavalry and he made
his men so agile and fearless they
could cut, "monkey shines" on hare
back of galloping horses.
Col. Dodd. so his men say. Is a "der
il for discipline." Pity the man who
tries to "soldier" In Col. B^i's regi
ment. A shot from the moBt sarcas
tic tongue in the United States army
brings him up quick to "attention."
Col. Dodd graduated from west
Point In 1876. ....
He soon afterward won his baptism
ot fire hunting Red Cloud Indians in
Nebraska. The young lieutenant could
ride like a cowboy and he was soon
known in the west as "Daredevil
Dodd."
When war with Spain broke out
Dodd was captain in the Third cav
alry He was at San Juan Hin, in
Cuba, and fought with Lawton and
Young in the Philippines.
On his return to the United States
In 1903 he was sent to Montana to
quell a Chippewa uprising. He has
been fighting Indians' along the bor
der for several years.
When Villa became troublesome
Col Dodd was immediately dispatch
ed to the Beat ot disturbance.
Col. Dodd Is a native of Pennsyl
vania. His father fought in the civil
war.'

Believed That Col. Dodd's

in Mountains.
Tin Cans Filled With Peb
bles Will Give Warning
to Guards.
| (By Associated I'ress)
| COLUMBUS. N. M., April 3.?'To
| day, five days lifter the forces oG
Francisco Villa began their flight from
the battlefield, of Guerrero before the
victorious Americans, details of the
pursuit are sti!ll lacking.
Military authorities here are inclin
ed to believ-a this means that Col.
George A. Dodd's American cavalry
men are still searching for the ban
dit leader in some remote mountain
wilderness of Guerrero far out of com
munication with the fiold base at
Colon & Oublan.
There was no official confirmation of 1
numerous rumors of developments in
the pursuit. Among these was one
that Villa had been captured and an
other that the bandit cliieftan. seeing
capture inevitable, had committed
suicide.
The stockade to be erected here to
confine the prisoners captured at
Guerrero wil be of barbed wire, hang
ing to which will be hundreds of tin
cans partly filled with prbbles.
Guards, to be - placed at intervals,
would be notified of any attempted
escape by the rattle of the pebbles
in the cans. Some apprehension was
expressed here today in a jocular way
that tho military authorities may be
j confronted .with a predicament slmi-,
lar to that.of Fort Bliss officials, who
in 1013 held 5,000 Mexican refuge:-*
prisoners. Word of regular meals
given to" prisoners soon reached
j friends on the outside with the result
that ?Ach morning at roll-call a larger
number responded than had answered
the day before.

of months have, he says, taken place
In tho payments, and in many Instan
