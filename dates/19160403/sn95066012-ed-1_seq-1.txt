London, April- 3. The German offi
cial statement issued In Berlin yester
day announces that Teuton troops
have cleared 1000 yards o French
trenches northeast of Haucourt In ad
dition to the positions taken March 30.
The Germans took 731 prisoners in

artillery bombardment near Vaux.
A dispatch from Paris at 11.40 p. m.
says that the Germans launched heavy
attacks again yesterday against the
French positions, both west and east
of the Meuse. To the west the at
tacks were repulsed, but to the east,
In the neighborhood of Fort Douau
mont, the assaulting forces penetrat
ed the Caillete wood, lying to the
south. From the northern pat of the
wood they were almost immediately
ejected by French couuter-att-icks.
No new infantry attack was
launched by the Germans Saturday
night against the French fortifications
of Verdun, according to the official an
nouncement issued yesterday after
noon by the war department in Paris.
On the western bank of the Meuse

French positions in Avocourt woods,
but there was no infantry attack. On
the east bank of the Meuso in the
Verdun section the night was calm.
The text of the statement follows:
"West of the Meuse the bombard
ment was rather violent against our
positions in the wood of Avocourt, but
there was no infantry action. East of
the Meuse the night was calm. The
enemy' in the region of Douaumont
and Vaux made no new attack. In the
Woevre the artilery activity was fee
ble. There was no event of impor
tance in the course of the night on the
entire front."
WAITE PREPARED TO DIE
Self-Confessed Poisoner Expects to Be
Electrocuted.
New York, April 3. The first of a
series of examinations into the sanity
of Dr. Arthur Warren Waite, self-confessed
Blayer of his father-in-law, John
E. Peck of Grand Rapids, was made at
Ttellevue hospital, yesterday, by an
alienist employed by the Waite fam
ily. After an examination had been
completed the physician who has been
attending Waite announced his physi
cal condition was such that he could
not be arraigned today to plead to
the indictment charging him with
murder in the first degree, as had
been proposed by District Attorney
Swann.
W. R. Duel, Waite's attorney, ad
mitted yesterday that his client had
confided to him that he had intended
to murder his wife, in the hope there
by of obtaining her share in the Peck
riches, love of money and the desire
for luxury, the attorney said, were the
motives for Waite's crime. The young
dentist now is suffering from remorse.
Mr. Duel said, and constantly ex
presses regard for his wife as well as
sorrow for the trouble he has brought
on her.
Waite, according to Mr. Duel, is anx
lous to atone for his crime as soon
as possible, "ai'd looks forward eager
ly to death in the electric chair." The
prisoner spends much of his time writ
ing letters and notes on whatever
scraps of paper he can obtain at the
hospital
WAR ENRICHES ICELAND
Natives Building up a Reciprocal
Trade with America.
Iceland was one of the poorest
countries in the world before the war
but it has made great wealth during
the past year. Most of the fortunes
have boen made by merchants export
ing fish, game, wool and hides to Eng
land. Such unprecedented sums hav
been deposited in the banks of Reik-
javlk that bankers do not know how to
invest their capital.
Iceland has imported great quanti
ties of American goods during the
war, but these have come through
other countries. Icelanders now want
direct stoamshlp communication with
the United States to promote recipro
cal trade. Plans have been made for
a steamship service between Roikjavik
and Boston, and sailings aro expected
soon. Icelandic business interests are
anxious for the appointment of a reg
ular salaried United States Consul
Great Britain and Franco are tho only
governments at present represented
in Iceland by salaried Consuls.
LEONARD H. GODFREY
Springfield Electrical Salesman Died
at Home Here Sunday Forenoon.
Iecnard H. Godfrey, aged 26, a
salesman for the General Electric
company and connected with the
o-. '-efield, Mass., office of that cor
j.J.a'e iih'fil at the home of his par
ents, Henry C. Godfrey,
on Main stret. . Sunday forenoon.
Because of failing ' health he was
granted a three months vacation last
December and returned to his home
here in the hope that the change of
location would be beneficial. Every
possible medical attention and the lov
ing care of family and friends, how
ever, failed to restore his failing
strength and his decline was rapid to
the end which peacefully came to him
at 11 o'clock Sunday forenoon.
Leonard Hyde Godfrey, was born
in Bennington October 15, 1SS9.
He was educated at the Ben
nington high school and began his
life work with K. E. Iarrabee, the
present superintendent of the Twin
State Gas and Electric company. He
followed the trade of an electrician
here in Bennington for about two
years and then entered the employ of
the General Electric company, being
first stationed at the plant in Pittsfield.
From Pittsfleld he was transferred to
Schenectady to complete his technical
knowledge of the business before tak
ing a position with the sales depart
ment. For about three years he had been
connected with the Springfield office
of the company and by his untiring
energy and faithfulness and because
of his thorough preliminary training
he had acquired an exceptional reputa
tion as a salesman and had won his
way into the esteem and affections of
his chief and his business associates.
in August, 11)14, he married Grace
D. Livingston, daughter of Mrs. James
H. Livingston, who together with his
parents, two brothers, H. Douglas
Godfrey and William Godfrey und
two ' sisters, Kuth M. Godfrey
and E. Florence Godfrey, have the
sincere sympathy of the community
in their bereavement. Here in Ben
nington, where the larger portion of
his life was passed, the news of hi?
death will be sadly received by a large
circle of friends.
The funeral will be held from the
house at 2.30 o'clock Wednesday after
noon, Rev. George S. Mills, pastor of
the Second Congregational church
will officiate and the burial will be in
the Park Lawn cemetery.

The housewife who sells her collec

to a junk dealer at the same price that

fact, she is loosing money at every

papers and white rags in particular is
so keenly felt by the paper manufac
turers that they are paying very high
prices for these necessary commodi
ties. The result is that junk dealerr
are growing rich and there is no need

ZEPPELINS Kill
56 IIIH8EE
7 RAIDS
Last Flight of Airships Was Over
Scottish Coast
ONE DIRIGIBLE DESTROYED
Fell Victim to Bombs Dropped from
Great Height by British
Aviator.
London, April 2. Three Zeppelin
raids have been made on England
wiU$u. the last forty-eight hours. The
third :of these was mude tonight, the
airships visiting the Scottish coast
arid the northeastern and southeast
era, counties of England. Details of
thi latest raid hv.e not been received
and' there is little information regard
ing Yns'ualtics.
Sixteen persons are known to have
been killed and a hundred injured by
bombs dropped by a Zeppelin in the
northeastern .counties last night, it
vidently had been planned for two
Zeppelins to take part in this raid.
wo machines were seen approaching
the coast, but only one crossed the
coast line, the other retreating over
he sea.
The localities raided by the single
Zeppelin which remained have not
been announced by the war office,
which says the bombs caused a ser
ious fire without mentioning the name
of the town. Eight houses also were
lcmolished by bombs.
In Saturday night's raid the Zep
pelin dropped a couple of bombs on
ach of several villages before It at
tacked the northeast coast town where
ourteen explosive shells and seven
ncendiary bombs were dropped, six
teen persons were killed, twenty-five
were seriously injured and eighty
lighty Injured.
Numerous stories received in Lou-
ton of Friday's raid repeat the past ex
periences of death, mutilation and. de
traction of towns visited by Zep
pelins In enrlier raids.
Compilation of a more complete list
of the casualties today shows forty
hree killed and sixty-six wounded.
The earlier partial figures, given out
resterday. were twenty-eight killed
and forty-four injured.
One of the British aviators who
went up to meet the Zeppelins Friday
night engaged in a fight with one of
the Invading dirigibles at an altitude
of 9,000 feet, dropping bombs on it
which he believed took effect. His
own aeroplane was hit in the engage
ment by bullets from the machine
guns of the Zeppelin.
Lieutenant Branden was the aviator
engaged in this fight. When he was
at an altitude of (I.OOO feet he caught
ight of a Zeppelin, 3.000 feet above
him. He sent his machine above tho
big dirigible and began dropping
bombs. Losing his place of vantage
above the German machine at one
time in the fight he regained it and
Iropped two more bombs, this time on
the nose of the Zeppelin.
What became of this Zeppelin after
the fight is not known, but It is sug
gested by tho war office as a possi
bility that It may have been the dirig
ible which dropped a machine gun, am
munition, a petrol tank riddled with
shrapnel bullets and some machinery
In the estuary, as was reported yester
day. The German official statement an
nounces that London was attacked in
tho raid, which, according to this ver
sion, had for Its objective London und
the south coast.
A detailed list of the points attacked
is given In the Berlin statement. Ac
cording to this list, bombs were "free
ly" dropped on the city of London be
tween the Tower bridge and the Lon
don docks, on military camps in the
northwestern part of the city, on fac
tories at Enfield and munition works
at Waltham Abhey. These two towns
nre to the north of London.
It was officially stated In London to
day that the German account of the
raid was "absolutely false," except, for
the admission which it contains of the
destruction of the Zeppelin L-15.

Columbus, N. M., April 2. The re
ports received here at base headquart
ers from the front today were to the
effect that Colonel George A. Dodd and
his men of the Seventh Cavalry were
still pursuing ViiU in a northwesterly
direction from the scene of last Wed
iK-sday's engagement.
There has been no further contact
with the Villa forces since their de
feat Wednesday, as far as is known
here. The army officers think the fact
that Villa has been wounded will make
It practically impossible for him tc
hide out, separated from his men, for
any considerable length of time, on
account of need of medical attendance
First Lieut. Allen W. Gullion of the
Twentieth Infantry, the Adjutant oi
the expeditionary base. left for tin
front today to make a tour of the eu
tire line of communication between tlu
base and the most advanced forces
The commanders of the base have
charge of the line of communication,
and it is the Adjutant's purpose to
strengthen this line and facilitate the
transmission of messages from tlu
front.
The fact that the four men injured
in the fight w ith Villa's force have not
been brought back here yet is taker
by headquarters to indicate that theii
injuries were very slight and that the?
ire being treated in the field, am'
soon will be able to return to dut
The first two automobile ambulances
left for the front yesterday, however
and it'is possible that these wounded
men will be kept at the field hospitaU
until the ambulances have arrived.
.San Antonio, Tex., April 3. 't was
ststeit yesterday at the headquarters
of Maj. Gen. Frederick Funston that
there appeared to be reason to believe
that (VI Cano. who was leading one
of the heavier Carranza government
forces operating with the America!-
forces in the search for Franclscc
Villa, had revolted against Gen Car
ranza and had joined the bandit. The
reports of Col. Cano's action had not
been confirmed late yesterday.
Unless Villa is definitely located
within the next day or two it is be
lieved at San Antonio that Gen Per
siting will begin a dogged search for
him in the mountains west and soutl
of Guerrero. Since the defeat o!
Villa's force, March 29, in and near
Guerrero, the American commander
ha? had lightly equipped model detach
meats of cavalry swooping through
the district, about the head waters of
the Santa Maria river in efforts to lo
rate the elusive bandit, reported tr
have gone in that direction after being
desperately wounded. Gen Pershinj.
did not get a report through to Ger,
Funston yesterday, but his chief of
staff reported, indicating that the line
of communication was maintained.
There is increasing belief that Gen.
Pershing may have been deceived ii,
regard to the direction taken by Villa
and even concerning his Injuries
Some reports indicate that he was not
injured at all, and instead of goinr
northeast of Guerrero he had moved
into the hills to the south and east
a direction American army officers
had expected him to take.

HOME ECONOMICS
Unique and - Interesting
Program
Saturday.
The Home Economics program of
the Fortnightly at the Congregational
chapel Saturday afternoon was unique
and very Interesting and reflects much
credit upon the committee under Mrs.
William H. Wills and also upon our
progressive and up-tc-date business
men who so kindly co-operated in mak
ing the affair a success. Their exhibits
of pure food, as guaranteed by the
Westfield catalogue, were most at
tractively arranged in the ladies' par
lor and were certainly an appetizing
sight. One of tire exhibitors had most
fortunately sent a demonstrator to
this minature food fair and so every
guest had a chance to taste a delicious
mayonnaise served on crackers; but
everything looked so thoroughly good
to eat that in spite of this opportunity
everybody went home hungry. The
merchants and business firms who con
tributed this interesting exhibit were
E. E. Bottum, W. L. Gokay, B. S.
Loomis. E. B. Patterson, C. L. Hudson,
Kates Market, Moore's Market, Me
dic's Market. The Satter Grocery
and Tea Co., The Direct Importing Co.
and the Davenport Bakery.
The recipes brought in by club mem
bers were conveniently arranged in
alcove, aad were easily copied by the
ladies who had come prepared with
paper and pencil. In this room there
was also a quiz for housewives of
twenty questions to test their efficien
cy, which was very amusing as well
as instructive.
The program opened with two short
papers, one read by Mrs. Wills and the
other by Miss Dorothy Patchin. a pupil
in the domestic science course of our
High school, and it was very pleasing
to hear so fine a record of the West
field pure food movemnet from one of
our young students. Between the
papers Miss Helen Cutting played a
piano solo, giving much pleasure and
the program as a whole was one of the
bert of the home programs presented
this year.
The next meeting on April 15, is the
last of the season, and beside import
ant business and the aunual election
of officers, will present an attractive
prigram on "Bennington Bird Life"
by Mrs. Lucretius 11. Ross and close
with a social tea.
ODDFELLOWS LOSE MONEY
Thief Entered Lodge Rooms Friday
Night by Fire Escape.
About $10 in money was lifted from
the cigar counter of the local Odd Fel
lows' Rooms Friday night by a thief
who gained access from the fire es
cape. Two desks were also pried open
by the intruder but nothing of value
taken from them.
The job was not the work of boys
Is certain because the lodge officer
state that after jimmying a window
from the fire escape in the rear, the
thief left the mud print of a new

Another peculiar feature of the

HIGHEST 0AM IN THE WORLD.
Difficulties Overcome In Building the
ArrowrocU, In Idaho.
The dam is built in n narrow, preelp
Ifous canyon, through which the turbu
lent Boise river races. Its name is
.mined from a gigantic rock in that
canyon, the ArrowrocK, which niid
won its name from tho custom of the
roving Indian?, who shot arrows Into
the face of it to tell their comrades
which way they had traveled. By the
angle .of the arrow the late comers
knew whether those in advance had
gone up stream or down or up one of
the many tributaries.
The construction of the dam com
menced in l'Jll, although much prelim
inary and preparatory work had been
done before that, the most Important
being Unit of diverting the river from
the site of the dam while the building
wns in progress. This was done by
cutting a tunnel through the cuiiyoj
walls for OU) feet and turning the
river through that. Tbls tunnel was
large enough to carry the river at its
highest flood mill was lined with ce
ment. When t he dam was finished the
tunnel was plugged with solid cement
In order to reach solid rock on which
to anchor the dam foundation it wns
necessary to go down ninety-ono feet
below the normal bed of the river. No
less than Ho.ooO cubic yards of soil
and gravel were removed to lay bare
this bedrock.
The dam us finished Is 348 feet high.

EXFEUnUIE
School Exhibition Will Be Made
an Annual
ACCORDING TO PUBLIC WISH
Over 1500 People Visited the Graded
School Building in Two Days
Last Week.
Although no appropriation was
made by the school-board to offset the
expenses of the school exposition held
last week in the graded building, on
figilrlng lip the expenses and receipts
this morning it was found that the af
fair had cleared a profit of $8.9G.
The natural question raised by par
ents or tax-payers when such an ex
hibit is proposed is: What will it
cost? Superintendent Varney and his
corps of teachers whose energy made
tho exposition a success, determined
to put on a school fair that should pay
its own expenses. Therefore admis
sion was charged in the form of col
lection to those who packed the as
sembly hall to witness the oral work
in the four programs given by the
children.
The total receipts from this source
amounted to $48.41. The expenses of
the entire exhibit were as follows:
Prize ribbons and printing $ 3.35
Lumber for tables 6.50
Paper Backgrounds 11.05
Screws, tacks, wire .80
Cash prizes 17.75
Gross expenses
$39.45
This left a net profit of $8.90. After
considering the work and cash which
the teachers had put in to bring their
room exhibits up to first quality, it
was decided that tho profit should go
to reimburse the pocketbooks of those
teachers who had advanced money to
children for material they could not
buy for themselves.
In addition to the above two ladies
contiibuted $1 each for paying for ma
terial used in basketry for children
who had not been able to purchase
raw weaving material for their1 ex
hibits.
One of the graded teachers went in
to her pocketbook to the extent 'of 3
for this purpose. A unique feature of
this cash distribution wa3 the fact
ihat when all teachers had turned in
a statement of their private expendi
tures to heli out their children, it was
ound that the surplus covered the
total within a few cents.
Supt. Varney estimated 1500 people
heard the four programs. The largest
itttndance was on the closing night,
Friday, when tho assembly hall was
taxed to capacity.
Friday evening after the last person
had gone, Mr. Varney stayed with Mr..
Southall and aided him In transferring
the prize-winner3 to the Drysdale store
for a window display. Saturday morn
lug all the teachers and several of tho
big boys returned and helped clear
iway the lumber and paper work, so
that when high school resumed ses
sion this morning after a week's va
cation the rooms were in apple-pie
order.
There were 29 cash prizes awarded
in amounts from 25a to $1. Nine
classes participated, the amounts for
each room averaging $1.75. There
were 108 blue ribbons awarded, the
ribbons going to both entries of hon
orable mention as well as those who
drew money recognition.
A strange feature in connection with
the exhibit was that the candy dishes
were the only exhibits which seemed
to suffer from theft. Although the
crowds, which jammed the building,
seemed more like the crowds of shop
pers the night before Christmas, no
shoplifters appeared. But if the Ban
ner published a list of the pilferers
from the candy plates, it is to be
reared that the "noblesse oblige" at
tached to the best families of tho
town, would puffer a tremendous fall.
Taken from everypoint, financial,
social and educational, the affair was
a success and If circumstances are as
auspicious next year, it will undoubt
edly remain an annual feature of local
school life.
