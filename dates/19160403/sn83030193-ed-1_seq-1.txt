generally, s-.iys tho War Oltlco an-1
nouncement this afternoon, In favor ,
of tho French, who Rained ground In
the northern part of Calllotto wood,
which was occupied by the Germans
yesterday.
West of the river a bombardment
was carried on near Haumont, with
out effect.
FollowliiR is the text of the War
Otllce report:
"To tho west of the Itlver Mouso
tho bombardment has contlnuod At
tho villages of Haucourt and Ksnes,
tut without any action of Infantry.
"To the east of the Mouse tho fight
ing which went on last night in tho
region of Dounumont and Vaux was
favorable to us. We gained ground In
the wood of Cnlllette. Our lino rests
on the right on the pond of Vaux, then
crosses the Caillctto wood, the north
ern corner of which la occupied by tho
enemy, and rejoins our positions to
the south and west of tho village of
Douaumont.
"It has been confirmed that the
attacks of the enemy yesterday wcro
extended over a fiont of three lstlo
metris. They came forward in suc
cessive waves, followed by sniiU col
umns. Tho activity of our attlllcry
and tho llro of our Infantry caused
heavy losses In tho ranks of tho
enemy.
One roport Is thnt tho German
Infantry engaged In tho attack
numbered 20,000.
"In tho Woovro dlstrlot tho night
passed qutotly. In Iorralno tho tiro
of our artillery caused flames to break
out at Los Ilemahois, to tho west of
Ielntrcy, and In tho region of An
cervlllor, to tho south of Illnmont.
"Tho reconnaissunco of tho enemy,
which was attempting to reach our
positions, was repulsed by our llio at
a point near Moyen.
"A Gorman aoroplaim bin fallen
within our lines. Tho aviators were
tal.eti prisoners."
In yesterday's fighting tho Germans
lengthened their front of attack to
about three hlloineues. (two miles.)
A new phase of tho battle has be
gun, and tho belief prevails that the
violence of tho latest attackh foro
shadows another attempt by tho Ger
mans to rush tho fortress with vast
forces. New batteries uf large calibre
have been moved up closer to the
French front, ami tin- German Infan
try has been rested and loorgnnl.ed.

tory for tho National Ouanl was won
In the Senate this afternoon when
Senator Cummins' amendment to the
Chamberlain bill, adding flvo mllltla
members to the army general staff,
was adopted 3.1 to 30.
The vote was a defeat for Senator
chamlierlnln and tho Military Cnin
mlttie, which had rejected the propo
sition on lhe ground that It would b
uns.-ifo to place National (luard olll
oeiH In such piedtlnns of high trust.
'I'll" vote was tho llrst In the Senate
on the Army bill and many Demo
crats supported the nmendment. Sen
iitor Chamberlain nnd his colleagues
did not attempt to oolicoal l heir dis
appointment. Tho vote was taken fo forecast a
general defeat for the Harrison
Chamberlain plan of national defenso,
consisting of a continental and re
servo army Instead of depending on
the Nation..! Ouanl for a reserve
force. The senatois, both I'emocratlo
and Itepilblleau, who rallied to the
support of Ctimmlns's nmendment are

(iuitrd as .mauiHl the advocates of a
