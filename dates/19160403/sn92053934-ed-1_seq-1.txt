German Spy
is Worked by
His Own Aids

three men named by Clarence Regi
nald Hudson, alias Ernest Schiller, a3
his assistants in an alleged conspiracy
to blow up with dynamite the Cunard

to arrest him before night.
Hudson, who captured the British
ship Matoppo at sea, will be arraigned
in court in connection with the Pan
nonia plot as soon as the case against
him is completed.
George Haller and Otto Milleder, ar
rested last night and held under minor
charges as Hudson's fellow conspira
tors, admitted today that they had fre
quent conferences with Hudson con
cerning his plans to blow up British or
French vessels lying at piers here.
They said they had received money
from him to buy dynamite, a motor
boat, revolvers and other supplies, but
asserted that they spent his money for
their own benefit and pawned revol
vers he bought for them.
"I was working Schiller for all I
could get," said Milleder. "I got about
$30 out of him to buy dynamite but I
spent the money on myself. He told
me about his scheme to blow up ships
lying at the piers of the Cunard and
French lines. I thought he was crazy
and decided to take his money."
Haller said Hudson proposed to Mm
within five minutes after they met to
blow up a Cunard line steamship. He
said Hudson planned to cross the river
from Hoboken in a launch, climb
aboard the steamer carrying guns and
dynamite and, when the steamer was
outside of Sandy Hook, hold up the
captain and crew and blow up the
ship, escaping in life boats.
"We took Hudson to be crazy," said
Fuller, "and decided to get what mon
ey there was in it."
Haller said that he and others had
obtained a motor boat for Hudson and
that the boat had never been used but
they got a great deal of money from
him by telling him it was for repairs
and supplies.
