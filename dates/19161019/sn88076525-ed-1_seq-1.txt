"Fewer Republicans are for Burke
than are for Wilson," said Mr. Lemke.
"There is no question as to the out

win this state without trouble, and as
the actual facts in the present cam

much more certain.
"Where is the cry—'he's knocking

FORMER AMBASSADOR CREEL
EXPECTS REPUBLICANS TO
RESTORE PEACE AND ORDER.
I notice what you say about the un
happy things in Mexico, and I cannot
help to say again that President Wil
son, is responsible for our great mis
fortunes Mexico and for the troub
les and expenses and dangers to the
American' people. President Wilson
certainly would be a very unhappy
man if he could realise that over 300.
000 lives have been lost and over $1,
000,000,000 in property destroyed ex
clusively on account of his blunders in
the Mexican policy. I am in great
hopes that the coming Republican ad
ministration will very soon change the
condition of Mexico and help mater
ially and effectively to restore order
and peace.
The above is an extract from a let
ter recently written by Enrique C.

Creel is ndw spending a few weeks in
California and the letter was written
from Los Angeles. He was a former
governor of Chihuahua and is one of

General Creel reports that political

NUMBER 2t
YOUNG SON OF MR. AND MRS.'
ERNEST GUNN DRAGGED TO
DEATH.
A terrible accident occurred at the
farm of Ernest Gunn, just out of the
city Friday afternoon, when Ernest,
the little four-year-old son of Mr. and
Mrs. Gunn was dragged to death. He
had been out with his father plowing
and they had been riding the plow,
and it was suggested that they walk
awhile. Mr. Gunn jumped from the
plow and as the little fellow attempt
ed to jump his foot was caught in the
wheel of the plow, the team became
scared and ran away, dragging the
lad over a half mile, and when his
father rushed to where he was he was
found dead. His leg and hip were
broken and he was badly cut and
bruised all over the body.
The funeral was held from St. Jos
eph's Catholic church in this city Mon
day at 10 o'clock a. m., and the re
mains were tenderly laid to rest in the
local cemetery. The bereaved parents
have the heartfelt sympathy of all in
their hour of sorrow.
LOCAL ELKS TO
GIVE PARTIES
The dancing committee of the local
Elks lodge are planning to give sever
al dancing parties in their beautiful
new home this winter. Dates have
been set for six dances between now
and next spring, and as this organiza
tion has established a record for good
times at these parties each winter,
they will be looked forward to with
much interest. The dancing commit
tee is composed of Dr. H. G. Hocking,
Herman- Schutte, Howard Maher,
Lloyd Stevens and H. A. Foss, and it
is heedless to say that this committee
insures a most pleasant time at these
parties.
The first dance of the series will be
the Hallowe'en ball, which will take
place on Friday evening, Oct. 27, and
all Elks and their ladies should gov
ern themselves accordingly and try to
be present.
POLICY IN MEXICO
MAKES WAR CERTAIN
EUROPE MUST IGNORE MONROE
DOCTRINE TO PROTECT SUB
JECTS, G. O. P. STATEMENT
SAYS.
Washington, Oct. 17.—President
Wilson's Mexican policy is malring
war inevitable, not only with Meadco
but with European nations, according
to a statement given out here today
by Chairman Wilcox of the Republi
can national committee.
May Ignore Monroe Doctrine,
The refusal of the Wilson adminis
tration to exact fulfillment by Mexico
of obligations, he declares, will wi»ln»
it necessary for the nations of Eu
rope to ignore the Monroe doctrine
and intervene there to protect their
interests with the certainty of draw
ing the United States into conflict.
Europe Will Collect Debts.
"With the end of the European
war, Mexico's creditors will turn their
attention to the collection of their
debts and unless order in Mexico «h»M
have been restored earlier, Europeans
will undertake to collect their claims
by force, unless the United States will
do it for them".
Under the Monroe doctrine this
country must not permit this, and war
will be the almost inevitable outcome,
Chairman Wilcox says.
