The Greek situation apparently
again has entered a critical phas.5.
Following advices that the Enten

the provisional government set xi.
by former Premier Venizelos to the.
island of Crete, dispatches from
Athens report a new note of "an
extremely grave character" hand

capital.
More than one thousand blue

various public buildings and an

ed. Concerning the fighting in
Greek Macedonia Paris reports
the repulse by the Serbians of a
Bulgarian counter-attack in the
Cirna river region, southeast of
Monastir and considerable artil

Heavy fighting continues on the
Somme in France. French troops
again took the offensive north of
the river and pushed their way
further into the village of Sailly
Saillisel on the Peronne-Bapaume
road, capturing another group of
houses and repulsing a German
counter-attack.
In Galicia, northeast of Halliciz,
the Austro-German forces have
begun heavy attacks on the Rus
sian lines. Petrograd makes this
announcement, instancing the
launching of assaults in the dis

vicinity of Bolshovtz, five miles
north of Ilalciz after intensive
fire.
The strong offensive opened by
Teutonic troops near the junction
of the borders of Rumania, Tran
sylvania and Bukowina has so far
been fruitless according to the
Petrograd bulletin which records
repulse by the Russians of all attacks.

As a campaigner Mr. Hughes
may not be a great success, but
as a circumnavigating song of in
ternal hate, he is a world-beater.
Another two weeks will see the
last of our eleven miles of con
crete walks finished and on the.
the streets that wero curbed and
asphalted, a fine plat of ground
offers an ideal place for planting.
In the past an open ditch took the
place that the trees should have
had but now that this ground is
filled in and leveled the proper
time has arrived for the planting
of Marian avenue and Taylor
street. This planting should not
be left to the disposition of each
individual property owner on the
street, or trees will be planted
anywhere but on a line, some too
close together or too far apart to
serve the purpose of utility or
beauty, while others serve neither
purpose and are useful merely as
n re wood or for their timber.
In this grass plat between the
walks and curb are two sewer
lines and in planting tijees these
two lines of piping should be con
sidered, for it doesn't pay you nor
your city to have these pipes pri
ed open by hungry roots hunting
for food and drink. Not only can
these roots pry open the pipes and
crack them but they can fill them
so full of roots in a year or two
that nothing can pass through
them. Every eucalyptus or rub
ber tree that is planted closer than
50 feet from a Bewer line will do
this in the course of a short time.
Tho only way that the planting
of city streets can be carried on
intelligently is to have this mat
ter taken care of by a board of
commissioners who have arbitrary
power given them in selecting the
trees to be planted, the planting
oi them, their care after they are
planted and the removal of trees
that do not fit into the scheme of
utility or beauty. California has
many of these boards and as a re
sult their streets look like beauti
ful parkways, assuming 'a beauty
they could never possess if left to
the ignorant selection of property
owners who make no study of the
problems entailed in this plant
ing. Many Florida towns have begun
this systematic planting of the
streets by an appointed board who
keep their office for 5 or more
years unless their service be un
satisfactory. Fort Myers, our
sister town, has such a board con
sisting of 3 members. They are
men who have a knowledge of
landscape planting and they are
given the power to select the trees
that shall be used on eaeh street
and they have the privilege of re
moving unsightly trees that don't
fit into the scheme of beauty and
they may do as they desire with
the removed tree. The. town
council gives them $1,000 per year
to carry on this work, but at the
present time they are not given
any reimbursement for their work.
The coming year they hope to
have another thousand dollars ad
ded for more extensive planting
and as the years go by and the city
grows, a greater amount can beset
aside each year for this purpose.
There is no reason why Punta
Gorda may not begin this same
work in a modest way on the two
edge that I have of plant nurser
ies all over the world I do not
know of a place where you can
buy a white Jacaranda and in this
nursery arc about 100 fin's young
plants just about ready to put in
tho open ground. The blue Jac
aranda in my own garden is one
of the most magnificent trees, in
creation; not only is it beautiful
when in bloom but its fern-like
foliage is quite unlike tho habit
of any other tree which makes it
unique and striking even i? if.
bore no flowers. The white Jaca
aranda has somewhat coarser
leaves which will give a pleasing
variation when planted with tho
blue one, and when both are in
flower in close proximity, the con
trast serves to enhance the beauty
of the blue.
This faoshould always be re
membered when planting blue
flowers; be sure to have some
clear, snowy white ones near the
blue. Suppose you have blue
pansies, or torenias or ageratum
planted, in close proximity plant
some pure white phlox or white
pinks. All these annuals do well
in Florida if the seeds are planted
in the fall.
To go back to the contents of
our local tropical nursery, in it
may be found one of the rarest of
palms Macroam ia spiralis which
is not listed in any plant catalog
in this country that I know of.
Another rare and lovely plant is
Latania Loddigessii, a fan palm
with a tint of red in the edges of
the leaves. The ; only catalog I
have that quotes this palm asks
from $5. to $10. for it. It won't
take long for one of the small
plants of this variety in our own
nursery to reach the $5. sixe. An
other rare shrub 'of most .beauty
which this nursery contains is the
Brownea. It is not listed in this
country and so far as my knowl-i!
edge goes it has only recently been
introduced to Florida.
When J. II. Veitch, of the fa
mous English nurseries, visited
India some years back he wrote
of the Brownea in thee terms:
"Opposite is the Br6ihiea ave
nue before referred to; the trees
are not yet considered to be in full
flower it is too cold (though as I
write the thermometer is 72 de
grees in my cool room), but I saw
many hundred, heads of blooms of
of Brownea coecuiea chieflv and
other species. They were, howcer,
not large a id,evideit!y not ful
ly developed. This acim?. or rath
er tunnel about s. lr.indred yards
long must be a magnificent sight
in the flowering season. There is
but little perceptible cessation of
gf-owth in these plants all the year
round."
Again he says: "Opposite to
this is a thick bush of Brownea
grandiceps in flower, thirty-threo
feet in diameter. It is curious
how much of its foliage is hidden,
where no light can possibly reach
it, and that many of its gorgeous
flowers are in a similar position."
The temperatures in the winter
in India go quite as low as thev
do here in southern Florida some
times, so that it is reasonable to
streets that arc ready for it: We exP('cts tnis 5f'an shrub to grow
can have three commissioners ap
pointed to carry out this work
and after deciding on the trees
that'are to be used, the property
owners along these streets should
be solicited to pay for the trees
needed ip front of their property
and when these trees arrive they
should be planted under the direc
tion of the commisioners, who
shall decide upon the place they
shall occupy in the plat and such
trees as do not belong in the plat
should be removed. Unles.s this is
done the whole scheme will re
semble a crazy patchwork quilt,
which went out of vogue nearly
20 years ago.
It may be known to some of our
people that a tropical nursery has
been in existence in our town for
the last two years and among the
specimens of.tropical and semi
tropical plants that it contains are
some extremely rare and beauti
ful. Indeed, so rare are they that
you cannot find them in another
place in the United States for sale,
and iii fact, even with the knowl-
in the State where no lower than
28 degrees is registered in winter,
ior snort periods ot time.
These arc only a few of the rare
things that this nursery contains.
There are flats filled with palms
of the most beautiful sharacter
which we may hope to some
day see growing in Florida. Many
of them are quite new and un
known to the trade in this coun
try. If Punta Gorda takes ad
vantage of the privileges which
this nursery affords it, as Fort
Myers has patronized her two
home nurseries, we'll soon be at
tracting as much attention to our
unexampled tropical vegetation as
India and Ceylon present to the
rest of tho world. This town could
and ought to use everything that
this nursery contains, thereby
keeping these rare plants right at
home, for it's certain that when
other, towns learn of tho uncom
mon plants it contains they'll be
snapped up and caried off before
we realize what we have losi.
