Macedonia
London, Oct. 18—Apparently the
Roumanians have- bees successful, at
least temporarily, in stopping the ad*
vance of the Teutonic allies all along
their border. At no point along the
line does either Berlin or Vienna claim
fresh successes against the Rouman­
ians, while the Bucharest war offico
asserts the troops of King Ferdinand
at various points have repulsed the
attacks of the Teutonic allies, inflict­
ing heavy losses on them and captur
ing a number of their officers and men.
Violent Fighting in Galicia.
Violent fighting is still in progress
in Galicia, where on the Narayuvka
front, the Bavarians have stormed a
Russian position and captured 350
men and 12 machine guns. Berlin as­
serts that west of Lutsk, in Volhynia,
following the repulse of the Rouman­
ians, the troops of Emporer Nicholas
have not returned to the fray, and are
merely bombarding Teutonic posi­
tions. The repulse of Austro-German
attacks in the Carpathians, where
snow is now falling, is recorded by
Petrograd.
French Make Fresh Gains.
Both north and soutfKftf thjk Soflggp&H -y7
the IVench troops have made fresh
gains. The village of Sailly-Sailllsel
is now entirely in their hands, and the
Germans have been driven from the
hills northwest, and northeast. Over
a front of a mile south of the river,
between La Maisonnette and Baiches,
the German' grsl line defenses have
been driven back by the French.
British Gain East of Thiepval.
East of Thiepval, gains by the Brit­
ish north of Guedcourt and in the re­
gion of Butte de Warlencourt, are re­
corded by the London war office. Pa­
trol encounters and bombardments
feature the fighting in Macedonia.
In the Austro-Italian theater, the
Italians are another step forward in
their advance in Trentino, having
broken the Austrian line between Cos
magone and Roite, and also taken a
commanding position on Mount Pasu
bio.
Greece Still Center of Interest.
Greece still remains a center of in­
terest as the result of the landing of
Entente allied marines at Piraeus and
Athens. F'resh demonstrations of bit­
terness by the Greek populace against
the marines have been shown, and
the situation still remains tense. An
appeal drawn up at a meeting of
Greeks at Athens has been handed to
the American minister for transmis­
sion to Washington. It asks the Am­
erican people "to avert the subjection
of those who desire only to remain
free."

seven youths, who were hooting the

them. The Greek military command­

Greek patrols were immediately plac­

The French admiral in command
informed the premier he would call

though it is thought possible that as

French troops may be withdrawn on
a pledge that (hp Greeks maintain

It is known that the king has given
command that anti-Entente demon­

POLICE MEJMFFLED
Oscar D. McDaniels, Prosecuting
Attorney, Charged With Kill­
ing His Wife
DEFENDANT CLAIMS
IT IS A FRAME-UP
Alleges Politicians Are Attempt­
ing His Defeat at Coming Elec-
tion Will Defend Own Case
St. Joseph, Mo., Oct. 18.Preliminary
proceedings in the trial of Oscar D.
McDaniel, prosecuting attorney of
Buchanan county, indicted by the
grand jury, charged with the murder
of his wife on the night of Friday,
July 14, were commenced today. Little
progress was made in the trial but
every effort will be put forth to push
the case through in all haste before
the November election, McDaniels be­
ing a candidate for re-election at that
time.
The murder of Mrs. Harriet
Moss McDaniel, wife of the
prosecuting attorney of Buchanan
county and the daughter of a
family socially prominent, was one
of the most sensational crimes that
has occurred in Missouri in many
years. Baffling to the police and de­
tectives, fraught with numerous clues
(none of which pointed strongly to
the murderer) and stirring St. Jo­
seph as it seldom hatt teen, the case
rejCh^dsHte?*••c.lthrai t".
M'cDaniel, the woman's husband, wps
indicted, charged with the killing.
Mrs. McDaniel was attacked and
beaten as she lay asleep in her home
the night of Friday, July 14. She
died a few hours afterwards, without
having regained consciousness. Two
of her three children—'one Ave years
old and the other ei^ht— were asleep
in a room adjoining their mother's,
but. were undisturb^tj.
Summoned by Fake Call.
Prosecutor :McDaniel said he had
been called away from home on a
fake telephone call, purporting to
come from his brother, in an uptown
saloon. As he returned, he was met
by one or more of the supposed mur­
derers and, in the darkness outside
of his home, engaged them in a revol­
ver fight.
The deed at once was placed at
the door of men who had been pros­
ecuted by .McDaniel and who had
sworn vengeance against him in nu­
merous letters received shortly be­
fore the murder. Concerning one of
the letters, he said to a friend, a few
hours before his wife was found beat­
en and bleeding:
Went Armed in Night.
"Ever since I received that letter,
I have been carrying a revolver, and
I am especially careful if I go out at
night never to be alone, and I am
avoiding all alleys and questionable
places. I have even thought of a
body guard, but decided it was not
necessary."
(McDaniels Protests Innocence.
A coroner's jury was unable to fix
blame, but on September 24, Bart M.
Lockwood, special prosecutor, former
schoolmate of McDaniel and his life­
long friend, basing his action upon
the findings of private detectives,
swore out a warrant charging first de­
gree murder against McDaniels. In
jail, the accused man protested his
innocence, declared that the action
was a political "frame-up" to injure
his campaign for re-election and that
the only result would be the blacken

Price of Wheat Soars
Skyward High Records
Since 1898 Are Excelled
Chicago. Oct. 18.—'Wheat prices ran
up excitedly almost -c a bushel to
day. on top of a Tc advance the da
before. All high records were excel
led since as fiir back as 189S. when
for a short time Joseph Leiter seem­
ed to have obtained control of the
entire existing surplus supply.
Broadlv active foreign buying of fu­
ture deliveries appeared to be the
chief reason for todays violent up­
turn. which, however, in the end was
not well maintained. The market
closed excited at the same as yester­
day's finish to S l-4c higher, with
December at. $1.6fi to $1.6t 3-8, and
May at $1.67 1-4.
Shortage in the wheat crop in the
I'nited States and Canada was fur­
ther accentuated today by increasing
alarm over the Argentina drought and
in regard to the premautre stoppage
of threshing in Canada.
Houses here with import-export
connections were conspicuous buyers
on every slight reaction in the wheat
market until the last half hour of
the session, when prices had overtop­
ped the high point reached in Febru­
ary of last year.
Corn rose with wheat and touched
the highest prices yet for 1916. Bull­
ish Canadian advices tended to lift
oats, which were also affected by the
upturn in wheat and corn.

Far From Being a
Vote
For
War
CANDIDATE DI8CUSSES
UNDERWOOD TARIFF
Arraigns Administration For Its
Failure to Observe the Merit
^7.
System
Kalamazoo, Mich., Oct. 18.—Charles
E. Hughes told an audience in the ar­
mory here tonight that a vote for him
was far from being a 'vote for war,
and really meant a vote for mainten­
ance of American rights and that
when Americans went abroad lawfully
to further American enterprise they
should go with the "backing of the
American government."
Discusses Merit System.
The nominee assailed the adminis­
tration for its foreign policy, for its
claim that it has aided business, for
the Underwood tariff, for alleged fail­
ure to observe the merit system in
making appointments, and for extrav­
agance. He declared the present pros­
perity of the country was temporary
and due to the European war. The
Federal Reserve bill he said, "giv­
ing credit where credit was due," was
largely the result of the report of the
republic monetary commission and
contained "defects which should he re­
moved."
Corrects Misquotation.
Mr. Hughes also took occasion to
correct a misquotation in the official
transcript of his sp$et at Omaha, in
which- fie' wrfs qtibteirHif saving' that"
the administration had not clarified
the anti-trust act, but. had added a
"fake phrase." Mr. Hughes said ho
had not used the words "fake phrase,"
but that he said that the phrase was a
vague phrase.
The special train, carrying Mr.
Hughes on his campaign trip, delay­
ed by a freight wreck, reached Kala­
mazoo more than two hours late. Mr.
Hughes was greatly fatigued by a day
of traveling, which was broken only
by stops at Niles and Dowagiac. Ho
spoke for ten minutes at Niles, and
said a few words to the crowd at
Dowagiac.

BIG RAIL SUIT
Vice President of Great Northern
Reiterates Testimony Given By
President Hill
St. Paul, Oct. 18.—George W. Mar­
tin, vice president of the Great Nor­
thern Railroad company, was the
principal witness today in the case
of Ramsey County against the Great
Northern, Northern Pacific, Chicago,
Burlington &
Quincy,
and Chicago,
St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha rail­
ways, for the collection of $3,030,000
in alleged personal property taxes.
Mr. Martin, in substance, reiterated
the testimony given
by
Louis W. Hill,
president of the Great Northern Rail
way company, yesterday.
Mr. Martin declared that the mil­
lions of securities which Ramsey
county hilds taxable were obtained of
necessity to foster the growth of the
railways and not for investment pur­
poses.
The County of Ramsey contends
that the securities are held for in­
vestment and are taxable. The rail­
way companies declare, however, that
the securities are held for raiiway
purposes and are taxable by the gross
earnings tax, which is being paid.
It is expected that, all the testimony I
in the case will
have
been introduced
by tomorrow. The case will be ar­
gued before Judge J. F. Michael, in
chambers, next month.

Hannah, X. D„ Oct. IS.—A. A. Scott

a cow in his possession but has failed
twice and has given up. Several days

a short time, wandered away from
home and was found the next morning
in a manger in his neighbor's barn,
dead with her neck broken. Scott
felt the loss quite seriously but decid­
ed to try again, so lie purchased an­
other. This cow insisted on eating
grass from the middle of the railroad
tracks and incidentally lost its life
when an engine struck it.

Louisville, Ky., Oct. 18 Asserting
that for three years "there had been
no protection of citizens abroad,"
Theodore Roosevelt in an address
here tonight in behalf of Charles E.
Hughes, Republican nominee for pres­
ident, assailed the course of President
Wilson in dealing with Mexico and his
conduct of the country's foreign af­
fairs.
'It combined lofty promise and com­
plete failure in performance, it con­
sisted of words which were nullified
by deeds," he said in summing up his
view of the president's course.
Entering Kentucky in the forenoon,
Col. Roosevelt delivered more than a
dozen rear platform addresses before
reaching Louisville. Crossing the
Ohio river at. Cincinnati his course
took him almost to the Tennessee line.
At Paris and Cynthiana, he told his
audience he was glad to be in Ken­
tucky, where if it was necessary "the
people were not too proud to fight."
His largest audiences were at Win­
chester and Richmond.
On his arrival here this evening, he
was met at the railway station by
large crowds which escorted him to
iJhoenix Hill park", about two miles
away, where he spoke.
Many persons unable to effect an
entrance were turned away.

North Dakota Minister Claims
Red Men Will Be Extinct
Within Fifty Year
Minneapolis, Oct. 18.Rev. C. L, Hall
of North Dakota, for two score years
a missionary on the Fort Berthold
Indian reservation, declared, in an
address before the American Mission­
ary association today, that the Indian
and white races will be completely
merged through intermarriage within
the next fifty years.
"Despite the fact that the Indian
birth rate is rising and the death rate
falling, I believe that the Indian race
will have disappeared fifty years from
now," the speaker said.
"Intermarriage betwen whites and
reds is rapidly increasing and with
the absence of the stigma, which at­
taches itself to the intermarriage of
certain other races, the only objec­
tionable feature lies in the fact that
many whites are marrying the Indians
to obtain their shares of tribal wealth.
But this, too, is hurrying the amal­
gamation."
Mission work being done in Porto
Rico was discussed at tonight's ses­
sion of the association, which will
conclude its annual meeting tomor­
row.

Denman Schutt Returns With
Father' After Adventurous
Two-Weeks Tour
DEAD BROKE, WORKING
AND ENJOYING MOVIES
Home, and happy, after an adven­
turous two weeks, which carried him
through western North Dakota and
into Montana, Denman Schutt had
some wondrous tales to tell his
schoolmates at the North Ward
school yesterday. Master Denman,
located at (Miles City through the
Young Men's Christian association,
returned to Bismarck in company
with his father, Dr. A. Schutt, late
Tuesday night. His father found him
dead broke, working IS hours a day
in a furniture store, taking in the
movies, tumbling into bed at mid­
night and out again at 5:00 in the
morning, longing for home, but lack­
ing the wherewithal to get there, and
just grinning and bearing it.
Worked His Way West.
Master Denman, who is 12 years
old, left home October r, going on
the early morning train to Mandan.
He had intended to take in the fair,
but once west of the river the lure of
the long trail gripped him, and 20
minutes later he was "hoofing it" to­
ward the setting sun. At L.yons he
climbed aboard the westbound morn­
ing freight, which carried him to
Dickinson, where he "got a job" pick­
ing up potatoes for a.farmer. After
a few days' industry, he resumed his
journey westward, pausing again for
a short stay at Glendive, where he
found similar employment. Thence
he went to Miles City, where he got
a place in a furniture store.
Denman Was Game.
Denman had to forsake the downy
at 5:00 a. m. and work until after
6:00 in the evening his funds were
running low, and it seemed to take
an awful lot of money" to fill his
stomach during the day and pay for a
movie in the evening—and the day.
from 5:00 in the morning until mid­
night, was very, very long, and a
growing boy of 12 became very, very
hungry. He thought of the comfort­
able home on Avenue B., but he had
no money to pay for a ticket, so he
"stuck it out." until an officer of the
V. M. C. A., who had read of Den
man's departure from Bismarck, iden­
tified the youngster, wired his father,
and brought Dr. Schutt post haste to
the rescue. Master Schutt is back in
school, hard at work making up on
his lessons, the hero of envious class­
mates.
