cents at J1.C6H; May rose IK to J1.67W.
The cause Is laid to short crops

vanced from 25 to bo cents per barrel,
until the quotation by millers and job

VICTORY FOR
Former Senator Bourne Claims
Result Will Show Landslide
for Hughes.
CANVASS IS WIDESPREAD
Questionable States Even Have
Greater G. 0. P. Leaning
Than Democrats Will Admit.
Based on advices from editors of
more than 1,200 newspapers, the Re
publican Publllclty Association through
its president, former Senator Bourne,
today predicted a Hughes landslide.
Ohio. New York. Illinois, and Mis
souri are among the States put into the
Republican column by Senator Bourne.
He says:
"Based upon information received
from editors of over 1,200 newspapers
representing every section of the United
States, we are confident that Hughes
and Fairbanks will carry every North
ern State, and that they have at least
an even chance In the border States
of Maryland and Kentucky. Largo
gains will be made In Tennessee, Vir
ginia, North Carolina, and Oklahoma.
"Many Democratic prognoatlcators
put Ohio, New York, Illinois, and Mis
souri in the debatable column, but un
less the editors from whom we have
received our reports are very badly
fooled, these States are safely Repub
lican and will participate In the land
slide which will culminate In an over
whelming Republican victory.
Few Dlssentlon In Party.
"Our reports show that with the ex
ception of about a half doxen counties,
the Republican party Is reunited, and
tho Indications are that where there
is still a dissension. It is ' over local
and not over national Issues. We are
advised that although there are. .some
Republicans who will vote for Wilson
chiefly on the absurd theory that 'he
haa kept us out of war' yut there are
relatively few such. Instances, and these
are greauy overuincri hv imp num
ber of Democrats who will vote for
Hughes because of general dissatisfac
tion with the Wilson Administration,
particularly In its mishandling of for
eign affairs. Its destructive tariff legis
lation, Its cowardly enactment of the
railway wage Increase law. and Its ex
travagances necessitating Increased tax
ation. Effect of Eight-Hour Law.
"While our reports show that aomo
Republicans directly benefited by the
r.iiwav lcelilatlon will probably vote
for Wilson because of that legislation,
those reports also Indicate that a mucli
larger number of Democrats will cast
their votes against Wilson and his Ad
ministration because of the recognized
Injustice and danger of class legislation
not based upon information or consid
eration of the merits of the measure
enacted, ,
"Our opinion, based upon advice from
editors throughout the country. Is that
the total vote for Republican candi
dates in 1916 will exceed tho total Pro
gressive and Republican votes In 1912.
while the vote for Wilson In 1916 will
be less than that recorded for him four
years ago."

Constantino in Person Urges
Followers to Abstain From
Acts of Violence.
ATHENS, Oct. 18 (delayed).
Greek troops are in complete con
trol of the situation here today,
anti-ally mobs arc being dispersed,
and for the time being the possibili
ties of a serious clash between
civilians and French marines seems
to have been averted.
The anti-ally leaders, however,
are continuing their attempts to
organize demonstrations, and the
crisis is by no means past.
It is understood that King Con
stantino, following conferences
with the British and French min
isters, sent personal appeals to the
most prominent of his supporters,
urging them not to stir up the
Athens crowds to acts of violence.
EXPECTED AID FROM U. S.
The collapse of reports that a I'nlted
States fleet was approaching Piraeus
to Intervene disheartened the civilian
crowds and has helped restore order.
Newspaper extras weic circulated about
the city by the anti-ally leaders, re
porting that American warships would
arrlvo within a few hours to see that
Greek neutrality was not violated by
the allies. These reports greatly en
couraged the mobs, thousands of
Greeks actually believing that they
would soon be joined by American ma.
rlnes.
"It is with Joy that we hear of the
approaching arrival of the great Amcr
lean fleet," aald one newspaper circu
lated by the royalists. "It brings relief
In the midst of our torments. America
resents the sorrows of the Greek people
and doubtless will proclaim her reproof
In a voice that will resound across the
sea."
The crowd that visited the American
legation to present an appeal for Amer
ican Intervention learned that these re
ports were ill-founded, and that news
spread quickly throughout Athens.
Greek Cabinet Protests.
The cabinet met today and It Is re
ported drafted a protest to the allies
against the arrest of Greek members of
the reservist league by French marines
last night. A crowd of tho reservist
leaguers hissed a patrol of marines who
dispersed them nt the point of a bayonet.
Greek troops witnessed the arrest but
did not intcrfcie.
