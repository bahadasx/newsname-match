(Special to the Pioneer)
Chicago, Oct. 19.Phrasing his ob
jection in his usual elegant diction,
President Wilson has taken issue
with the Republican charge of sec
tionalism which has been registered
against the Democratic party. The
president adroitly puts the burden
i^pon those who make the charge,
thus seemingly removing it from
those who have committed the of
fense. In his Indianapolis speech
delivered October 12, President Wil
son said:
"Any man who raises the issue
of sectionalism in this country
is unworthy of the confidence
of the nation He shows him
self provincial that he does
not know the sections of his
.j* country/ and to be ignorant."
i Those Who have placed the charge
li" of sectionalism upon the Democratic
party will agree precisely with what
the president said. When one sec
ion of the country votes solidly, and
when it acquires domination of the
government because of this solidity
based on a local issue, although it
is a minority, this alone constitutes
a plea of guilty to the charge of sec
tionalism, but it is not only in this
way that the South has acted sec
tionalism only to depreciate the
charge of sectionalism in order to
cover the offense. There is no solid
North, and never will be for the rea
son that sectionalism does not exist
TO the North, but the North is not
oblivious to the process of benefi
cient assimilation that is being prac
ticed by the section of the country
which represents only 15 per cent of
its developed resources.
Austin Well Reuresented.
The roll of Southern officeholders
has been called. In addition to Bur
leson and Gregory, both from Austin,
Tex., and Secretary Houston, who
lived there previous to his appoint
ment, the little town of Austin is
fairly represented in{|the presiden
tial cabinet Austin ,also has the
distinction of being the home of Col
House. The colonel is not officially
a member of the cabinet, but there
is a generally accepted opinion that
he exercises more than cabinet in
fluence, with none of its responsi
bility. With McAdoo, a Georgian,
and Daniels, a North Carolinan, the
South appears to be fairly well en
trenched in the cabinet. Secretary
Lane was born in Canada, while
Secretary Wilson was born in Scot
land, while the North and West are
represented in the cabinet by Lan
sing and Redfield, of New York and
Baker of Ohio, who owns West Vir
inia as a birthplace.
How genial Southern atmosphere
runs through the government under
the present administration may be
discerned by inspecting the household
of Josephus Daniels, secretary of the
navy. Secretary Daniels is a firm be
liever in protecting home industry
His brother was sent as a carpet-bag
fr*r to Minnesota There are rumors
that a war contract placed with a
firm in his own home city failed to
come UD to specifications His chief
of naval operations is a Georgian his
chief of the bureau of navigation is
a Missourian his chief of the hydro
graphic office is a North Carolinan
his director of naval intelligence a
Georgian his chief of the bureau
""fcf construction and repairs is a Vir
ginian his chief of the bureau of
steam engineering is also a Virgin
ian his chief of the bureau of sup
plies and accounts is a South Caro
linan, while the judge advocate gen
eral hails from Tennessee. Put none
but Southerners on guard, is seem
ingly Mr Daniels' watchword, and
he has done so with a vengeance

Getting Results.
The consolidated system is the best
for rural districts, according to W. P.
Dyer, superintendent of Bemidji
schools, who inspected 12 rural
schools in Hubbard county Tuesday
and Wednesday for the state depart
ment of education. The inspection
was made to determine the general
attitude toward consolidated schools
and to note comparison between the
schools.
"Consolidation is a means of cor
recting some of the faults of the
country school system," said Mr. Dyer

want to work for because it means
better schools. Under this system,
children are given better accommoda
tions and more qualified teachers are
secured."

bard county. He has an excellent
system, good schools and good teach

(By Staff Correspondent)
Turtle River, Minn., Oct. 19.Resi-
dents of Turtle River were brought
':face to face" with the seriousness
of the ditch bonding situation by
Charles S. Carter, candidate for legis
lature from this district, at a meet
ing held last night in Peter Larkin's
hall.
A good sized audience composed of
men and women took a keen interest
in Mr. Carter's explanation of valua
tions, ditches and bonds. After the
meeting several of the men remained
in the hajl and discussed the situa
tion. They expressed their approval
of Mr. Carter's pledge in which he
stated that he was "opposed to far
ther issuing of ditch bonds in this
district until the present judicial
ditch, law is amended so that ditches
wyi be constructed only where the
quality of the soil, prospective set
tlement and general conditions war
rant the same."
"I believe the operation of the
present judicial ditch law to be ex
cessive and costly," said Mr. Carter,
"and that the homes and property of
our citizens, which are pledged for
the payment of the interest and prin
cipal of the bonds have been jeopar
dized by the enormous issue of bonds
and the high rate of interest paid
therefor."
He explained that when the first
bonds were issued, only four per cent
interest was charged and that the in
terest had been Increased until now
six per cent is paid. He pointed out
that the ditch bonds issued amounted
to $1,852,350 that the ditch bonds
authorized but not issued amounted
to $1,011,500 that the total ditch
bonds amounted to $2,813,850. In
addition to the ditch bonds, road
bonds to the extent of $278,000 have
been issued and $154,000 refunding
or court house bonds have been is
sued. The total indebtedness of Bel
trami county, according to figures
tabulated by an abstracter, is $3,-
285,850, Mr. Carter stated.
Gains Much Favor.
In the Turtle River district his
campaign on the stand "stop ditch
ing and blow more stumps" is gain
ing much favor, according to several
of the men who attended the meeting
last night.
Mr. Carter filed on a homestead in
this district in 1898, lived here for
three years and proved up his home
stead. He later went to St. Paul and
studied law. Later he went to Ten
strike where his father was living
and he started in the cedar business.
Later he went to Hines where he has
since resided.
Mr. Carter filed for the office of
representative because of conditions
in this county and his candidacy has
been received with much enthusiasm.
Despite the fact that the meeting
at Turtle River last night was only
arranged a few hours before, a good
crowd greeted the candidate
Turtle River is a thrifty little vil
lage on Turtle River lake, where are
located fine summer cottages It is
surrounded by fertile lands from $5
to $25 per acre. The little village
is widely known for its "country"
dances at which villageites and set
tlers dance until the "wee hours of
the mornin.'
Judge Quinn is making abi cam
paign for judge of the supreme court.
He is a fair and impartial judicial
officer and is recognized as one of
the most aby judges in Minnesota.
It is conceded that Governor J.
A. A. Burnquist will be re-elected by
a large vote.
Just like in the "days of old,"
Daniel W. Lawler, Democratic candi
date for United States senator, wants
to debate with Frank B. Kellog, Re
publican candidate. Bemidj would
be a good city in which to 1 id one
of the debates.
L. G. Pendergast, candidal for re
election to the state legislature, and
his friends are working hard to se
cure his re-election. It is reported
that W. B. Stewart, county superin

campaigning for "Pendy." J& &
