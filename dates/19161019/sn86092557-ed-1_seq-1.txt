wearing down the Germans would bo
Inaugurated and would probably last

that after it peace would he made.
Their tone has been entirely different
? of late. They recognize that it is a
fight to a finish between the man power

come from the fearful attrition on the

CLARKSBURG, Oct. 19.?Democratic
newspapers hare been printing a
picture ot a watch fob on which is a
picture of Governor Hatfield, and the
inscription "H. D. Hatfield for U. S.
Senator." Governor Hatfield, In an
address In Marlon county several dayB
ago, took cognizance of this petty
method ot campaigning, and said that
he was in total Ignorance of the origin
ot this advertising fob, and did not
underestand purpose of it but yet he
believed it to be a Democratic plot
The truth ot the origin of the fob Is
contained In a letter written to National
Committeeman V. L. Highland,

This letter written from

Oot. 16, 1916.
Mr. V. L. Highland, Nat. Com,
Clarksburg, W. Va.
Dear Sir:
In reply to your Inquiry regarding
samples of campaign advertising matter
showing portrait of Governor Hatflld
and wording "for U. S. Senator?
H. D. Hatflld," I beg to say that I had
these made up about twelve months
ago. At that time I was Informed that
Governor Hatfield would in all probability
be a candidate for the Senate
and I procured a photograph (I think
I got It from a photographer in Charleston)
and had several samples prepared
so as to have them on hand
when I would be making my regular
January trip to West Virginia.
Before I started on the trip I learned
that Governor Hatfield would not
be a candidate and I merely put one
or two samples of the article In my
case to Illustrate campaign work on
buttons, watch fobs, etc.
So ' r ' Governor Hatfield Is concer
? has never, to my knowledge
Hoet. - of tbcse samples and probably
does not know they were eyer
made up.
It is my regular mothod of beating
the other fellow to It to have actual
samples, with portrait and wording all
properly shown and flash them on the
prospective candidate at the earliest
possible opportune moment.
No ono except mo and my factory
knew of the preparation of those Hatfield
samples until I came to West
Virginia this year, and In every In itanve
where they were shown I have
related the joke on me. viz I was a litIn
too previous In preparing the samples.
O course no order for them was
ever placed with me, and only two or
three samples of each article are In
existence. Very trulv yours,
C. R. CAPERTON
