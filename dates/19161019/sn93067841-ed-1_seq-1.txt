rBLEASE BALLOTS
OFFERED VOTERS.
VOTERS ARE ASKED TO REGARD
BLEASE AS ACTUAL NOMINEE
IN GENERAL ELECTION.
The Scimitar, a semi-monthly political
paper edited by a Blease partisan,
W P Beard, and published at
Abbeville, displays conspicuously a
ballot headed "For Governor: Cole
L Blease," and calls upon "the Reform
Democrats" to vote that ticket.
The Scimitar says that Mr Blease
himself, bound by the pledge he took
on becoming a candidate, is obliged
to abide by the decision of the executive
committee, which nominated
R I Manning, and therefore he will
not likely make a statement. "But
the voters are not bound by anything
but the oath to support the
nominee," The Scimitar says, "and
a majority has a right to say who is

LAWS ON LIQUOR i
STAND ACID TEST.)
GALLON-A-MONTH ACT AFFIRMED
BY DECISION OF COURT EN BANC, j
WEBB-KENYON ACT IS UPHELD, i
Both the gallon-a-month act and j
the Wehb-Kenyon law are upheld in
decisions of the supreme court en
banc filed Saturday. E J Brennen
of Columbia brought pn action in
the Richland circuit court to upset
the gallon-a-month act and on losing
there took an appeal. The Wf>?;b
Kenyon law was brought into question
in action brought in Greenwood
by the Charleston & Western Carolina
railway against Reuben Gosnell,
chief of the county rural police, and ;
others.
The court en banc held that a dis-j
crimination complained of in the
Brennen case did exist under the
dispensary system in force at the
time the suit was begun, but that
State being "dry" now no discrimi-?
nation existed.
In the Gosnell case the court sus- j
tained the right of peace officers to j
seize liquors in transit for unlawful'
purposes, without awaiting either j
actual or constructive delivery. The |
shipment in question was shipped,
"order nofify" and od its being'
seized the railway sought to recover!
it under claim and delivery pro-;
ceedings.
The court's opinion in the Brennen
case, written by D E Hydrick,
associate justice, was concurred inj
by Chief Justice Gary, Associate
Justices Fraser and Gape and Cir-1
cuit Judges John S Wilson, H F Rice,
Mendel L Smith. Ernest Moore, T S
Sease, James E Peurifoy, R W Mem-1
minger, Frank B Gary. A dissent-'
ing opinion by R C Watts, associate J
justice, was concurred in by Circuit!
Judges George E Prince and J W
DeVore. A separate dissenting opin-!
ion was filed by S W G Ship, circuit;
judge.

To the Farmers of Williamsburg and
Adjoining Counties. I
The world is clamoring for bright
tobacco, and we have the climate
and soil for raising it. Prices will
remain high for years to come.
North Carolina is raising all she can
and has a short crop this year on;
account of excessive rains. I would
like to see every fanner in our countv
plant some tobacco next year. I
don't mean for any one to over-do
the thing; I am a great believer in
planting some cotton, corn and tobacco.
I don't think it wise to put
all of the eggs in one basket. I
want to say right here that only last
week I was introduced to a Chinaman
on the warehouse floor in east- i
em North Carolina and he was pla-'
cing orders in all the markets of the j
east for the high priced tobacco j
which they areusingfor cigarettesand
need more of it each year. In a few
years China will be using millions of
pounds of our bright tobacco. Will
write you again soon.
