the soliciting committees arc planning
to redouble their efforts next week in
- an effort to reach the one thousand
mark the first year of the Union's ex
istence. The present membership in
cludes about 325 students and about
75 members of the faculty. The alum
ni have not been actively solicited
jet
A series of smokers and entertain
ments to end up with the homecoming
celebration the day of the Texas game
are being arranged and the first
smoker will be tomorrow night after
the mass meeting. Ever' student,
whether a member or not is urged to
attend.
So active are the soliciting commit
tees that one student said today that
the only place a man was safe from
a solicitor was in the Union Building
itself. At present the building itself
is held sacred and no one In it is
asked to become a member. "The build
ing is open to all students," said H. H.
Kinyon, secretary, today. "Later we
will admit only members but now we
want everyone to come and see our
home."
At present the students are being
solicited for membership by schools. A
committee is working in each school
or college of the University, but next
week the city will be divided into sec
tions, each committee working in one
section.
In this way every student in the
University will personally be asked to
Join the Union.
C Buttons Hare Been Ordered.
"U" buttons to take the place of-the
membership cards now being given
out have been ordered and will be
given to the members as soon as they
arrive.
The membership committees are
meeting at the Union Building every
night to report progress during the
day. Every member of a soliciting
committee is urged to he present to
night when plans for next week's cam
paign will be talked over.
The local members of the board of
directors will meet at 9 o'clock tomor
row night to take up the matter of
life memberships. The present cost
of a life membership is $100, but many
alumni of the Union have said they
would gladly take a life membership
if the price was a little less, so the di
rectors will probably reduce the cost
to $50.
The matter of the cost of member
ship for students in the Short Course
in Agriculture will also be taken up
soon. Already there haj-e been many
queries as to whether short course
students were eligible to membership
and whether their dues would be the
same as other students. Mr. Kinyon
said today that any man taking work
in the University, whether a regular
student or not Is eligible.
Girls Are Joining, Too.
Many girl students are joining the
Union. One membership solicitor in
terviewed five girls this morning and
all signed applications. "The girls are
all back of the Union just as soon as
they understand just what it ia and
that Its future plans include accommo
dations for women," said one girl as
she signed her application blank.!
The only trouble Is that they don't
understand the proposition. They
think it is only for men and that there
never will bo a chance for a woman
to get anything out of It."
Mr. Kinyon today received word
that twenty alumni in Kansas City
had already asked for life member
ships and that the number would un
doubtedly be greatly increased.
Horticultural Club Gets Together.
The Horticultural Club gave a spe
cial program for all men interested

Speculation Arises From Re
duction' in Shipping In
surance Rate.
By United Press
NORFOLK, Va., Oct 19. A German
submarine, possibly the U-53, has been
sunk off Nantucket, according to a
message the British steamer North
Pacific claims to have received The
North Pacific is taking on coal here
today. Although she arrived -here
Monday night from New Orleans, the
Xdrth Pacific did not report receiving
the message, from what was said to
be a British cruiser, until today. The
message read: "German submarine
sunk east of Nantucket."
Officers of the Pacific said the
cruiser was lying off this coast.
A London cable to the United Press
a few days ago said the reduction in
the insurance rate on transatlantic
shipping by Lloyds had aroused spec
ulation as to whether the U-53 had
been sunk, captured or had returned
to a German port. It was believed
that the reduction was ordered be
cause Lloyds had- received "inside"
information.
Mrs. Montrlef to Be Buried Here.
Funeral services for Mrs. Eunice
Montrlef, who died Tuesday night in
Louisville, Ky., will be held at the

! IVIAKE ATHLETICS PAY
Director C. L. Brewer Tells
Commercial Club How
Teams Get Along.
STATE GIVES NO AID
Schulte Believes Van Dyne's
4'"Loss Sets Back Tigers
.a Whole Week.
That faith and confidence are as es
sential to the success of an athletic
team as to the success of a business
enterprise was the opinion advanced
by C. L. Brewer, director of athletics
in the University, in a talk before the
Commercial Club at its weekly lunch
eon today. The address was upon the
relationship existing between the busi
ness men of Columbia and athletics at
the University. .
University athletics is one of the
businesses of the city," he said. "The
it is necessary that strictly business
methods be employed.
"Never, in the last few years, has
the athletic department asked the
business men for contributions of any
nature, and we strive to give value
received in all athletic contests. It is
just straight business all the way
through we have the 'goods' and you
pay for what you get."
Wr Tlrnm. ntitArl t e A9tl-
,, . ., . . . ,
culty in discussing any one branch of
,,,.,.. . ... ... ,
athletics while that sport was "in sea
son." He expressed faith in the foot-
ball team and described the members
as "the cleanest, finest, keenest, sharp-
est bunch of football playera any
where."
"A football team should neither win
nor lose, altogether. An occasional
defeat is necessary in order that vic
tories may be properly appreciated.
That is the distinction between a
'sport' and a 'sportsman' a 'sport de
mands continuous success, while the
true 'sportsman' backs his team, win
or lose. We have both kinds with
us."
Henry F. Schulte, in charge of foot
ball, followed Mr. Brewer. ''I'm go
ing to tell you all about the football
team up to a certain point,' was Mr.
Schulte's rharnrtpHsH intrnrtnrtfnn
"The team emhor ro n snannv .
aggressive bunch of players and the
team has a running start. The loss
of the Van Dyne means a greater re
organization than most persons real
ize and is equivalent to at least a
week's setback. Groves, who had
played before at left tackle, is some
what out of place on the other side
Of the line and it is impossible to say
just when the team will recover its
former smoothness.' " v
"The Washington team outweighed
the Tigers six to ten pounds to the
man," said Schulte. The team which
will step upon the field to meet Ames
next Saturday will average from 163
in tr.r. nn,no 'i ii,0 .,.. nmniiiii'

said Schulte. "The smaller the men,
the better football players we.fgund
them to be, and our most efficient
backfield will average no more than
146 pounds."
The Tigers' inability to Bcore when
close to the Washington goal several
times last Saturday was due, believes
Schulte, to the Pikers' secondary de
fense, which massed behind the line
of scrimmage and smothered all plays
which came through. Schulte explain
ed that a rapier style of attack was
necessary when close to an opponent's
goal and that at present the team
lacks an offense sufficiently crushing
to score through a double line of de
fense. That the Tigers will be out
weighed in every game this season is
Schulte'8 opinion.
"I want it made clear," concluded
the 'big coach, "that I am not offering
this as an excuse, but am merely ac
quainting you with the facts. I be
lieve in the team and have all con
fidence in their ability."
At the luncheon next Thursday, H.
H. -Kinyon. secretary of the Missouri
Union, will address the club on the
relation of the faculty to the union.
The road district will be discussed.

ANTIALLY UPRISINGS
Athens Mobs Encouraged by
False Reports of U. S.
Interference.
CRISIS IS NOT PAST
Cabinet Protests Arrest of
Reservists by French No
Resistance.
Dy United Press
ATHENS, Oct. 19. Greek troops are
in complete control of the situation
here today and anti-Ally mobs are be
ing dispersed. For the time being"
the possibility of a serious clash be
tween civilians and French marines
seems to have been averted. The an
ti-Ally leaders, however, are continu
ing their attempts to organize demon
strations, and the crisis is by no
means past.
It Is understood King Constantino,
after a conference with British and
French ministers, sent personal ap
peals to the most prominent of his
supporters, urging them not to sUr
up the Athens crowd to acts of vio
lence. The collapse of the reports that a
United States fleet was approaching
Piraeus to intervene disheartened the
civilians and helped restore order.
Newspaper extras were circulated to
day in the city by the anti-Ally
leaders, reporting that American war
ships would arrive within a few hours
to see that Greek neutrality was not
violated by the Allies. These reports"
greatly encouraged the mob, thou
sands of Greeks actually believing
they would soon be joined by Ameri
can 'marines.
The cabinet met today and, it is re
ported, drafted a protest to the Allies
against the arrest of Greek members
of the reservist league by "French ma-.,
rine3 last night. A thousand of the
reservist leaders hissed the patrol of
marines, which dispersed them at the
point of the bayonet. Greek troops
witnessed the arrest but did not in
terfere. French AdTance Toward Peronne.

COXTIXUAXCE GRAXTED IX TRIAL
McDaniel Hearing Postponed to Let
State's Counsel Study Case.
By United Press
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Oct 19. Con
tinuance was granted today in the Mc
Daniel murder trial until tomorrow to
give the state's new voluntary coun
sel time to study the case. The de
fense objected strenuously, demanding
that the trial be expedited, so that the
verdict- might be returned before No
vember, when McDaniel will go to the
polls, a 'candidate to succeed himself
as county prosecutor.
Two former prosecutors, L. A. Vo
ries and H. E. Culver, have been se
lected to aid Special Prosecutor Lock
wood. The action of the local attor
neys followed a realization that Lock
wood was confronted by an over
whelming array of legal talent on Mc
Danlel's side and belief that the spe
cial prosecutor was getting little co
operation from the courthouse offi
cials, fellow officers of the accused
man.
