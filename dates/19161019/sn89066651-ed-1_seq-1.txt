New-report cards were printed

done by our local paper. j
These reports are printed in!
three colors, orange for the pri-'
mary department; blue for the
intermediate and grammer de-,
partments; and white for the I
higlf school department. The

the teacher from time to time in
regard to the progress ot the
pupil. Nothing counts more to
ward the welfare of the pupil than
a cIonc cooperation between par
ent and teacher.
Discourage, to a piohibitive
degree, the tendency to loaf
about town which pupils some,
times manifest. Such a habit
will counteract tiie work which
i he school is trying to accom
plish. Social functions for pupils
diould be put oil' till the week's
tchool work is llnished. 1 1. is not

DO YOU WANT PEACE WITH WILSON,
OR WAR WTO HUGHES?
There la tnly ne choice as against peace, and that la war.
Some of tha aupparters of that (the Republican) party, a very
great body af the lupportcrs of that party, outapakanly declare
that they want war; to that the certain prospect af tha auccess
of the Republican Party Is that we shall be drawn In ana farm or
other Into tha embroilments of the European war, and that to the
south of us tha force of the United States will ba used to pro
duce In Mexico the kind of law and order which soma AmerJean
Investors in Mexico consider most to their advantage.
There ia mere serious aspect even than that. There la an
Immediate result af this thing, my fellow citliens. From this
time until the 7th of November it is going to be practically Im
possible for the present Administration to handle any critical
matter concerning our foreign relations, because all foreign
statesmen are waiting to see which way the election goca; and in
the meantime they know that settlements will be Inconclusive.
