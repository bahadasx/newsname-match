IN MEMORIAM ,
"Little Alberta is gone." There are
the words on our lips today, for once
more God has sent his death angel
into our midst and taken one of our
sweetest flowers little Alberta Mc-
Lucas.
She has left behind her a darkened
home,, where once she was the light.
She has left a silent home where once
she was a very ' song bird, with her
baby prattle, making music all the
day. She has left father and mother
with bleeding hearts; she has left lit-
tie brother without his dearest play-
mate, but our loss is her train, and to-
day she is 'free from suffering and
happy with the ansrel band.
As we stood beside the casket and
looked at her little form, surrounded
and covered, as it was,1 by the sweet
fragrant flowers she so loved, wc
heard a friend express our thoughts
in the words, "She looks so like an
-
angel." And to the sorrowing parents
we say, she is not dead but just
asleep. Today you have one more tie
to bind you to heaven, one more little
hand from the gateway is beckoning.
Dear loved ones, let us bow our hearts
in humble submission to His will.
knowing God doeth all things well.

HOWr CATARRH IS CONTRACTED
Mothers are sometimes so thought-!
less as to neglect the colds which their
children contract. The inflammation
of the mucous membrane, at ' first
acute, becomes chronic and the child
lias chronic catarrh, a disease that i3
seldom cured and that may prove a
life's burden. "Many persona who
have this Iothsome disease will re
member having had frequent colds at
the" time it was contracted. A little"
forethought, a bottle of Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy judiciously used, and
all this trouble might have been avoid
