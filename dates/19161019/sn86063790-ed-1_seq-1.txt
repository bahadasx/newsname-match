Washington, Oct. 17.?The weather
bureau tonight reported the tropical
storm still moving northward

jxact location and probable point of
striking the coast could not be decermined.

ssued tonight. (

Job Paper Prices. '
1
People who use stationery are having
to pay pretty dearly for it these
lays, it is generally understood by j
everybody that the prices on all kinds ;
if papers have advanced "out of (
sight." This advance applies espec- .
[ally to fine papers. Notwithstand
ing the fact that the price of paper j
has been widely discussed in the
aewspapers, some of the customers
if The Herald's job department do
aot fully understand why we have ,
tiad to advance our prices. We do <
aot know a great deal about the ,
2ause of the advance. About all we
2an say is that the mills and jobbers
ascribe it to the war. At any rate, .
we do know that all papers are
costing us about fifty per cent, more
than formerly. On some lines the
advance is much higher. Envelopes
that we used to pay 72 cents per
thousand for now costs us $1.36;
bond paper we used to get for 10
cents a pound now costs us 15 cents; Strathmore
parchment paper, one
of the finest known to the printing
trade, formerly cost 24 cents a pound,
and it now costs 35 1-2 cents. The
increase in expense is not confined to
papers, either; everything else we
have to use costs according to paper.
We have not increased our prices fifty
per cent., although we would be
justifiable in doing so, but there is
nothing else for us to do but to advance
our prices to cover the increased
cost of paper. One paper
that has been affected more than any
other is the ordinary colored circular
paper. It now costs 10 cents per
pound?when it can be had at all?
which is about fifty per cent, higher
than the best grade of news paper.

The Spider and the Top.
"See that spider, my son, spinning
its web," said the instructive parent
to his small son. "Is it not wonderful?
Do you reflect that no man
could spin that web, no matter how
hard he might try?"
"Well, what of it?" replied the
up-to-date offspring. "Watch me
spin this top. No spider can do that,
no matter how hard he may try."?

Strange, Isn't It?
"Isn't our ice bill rather high,
dear?" asked the young husband as
he looked over the household accounts.
"I was just going to ask you about
that, love," said tne bride. "I can't
understand it at all. I've been just
as economical as I possibly could, but
we never seem to have enough ice.
Why, I've even left the icebox door
open on hot days to cool off the ice."

SALLON-MONTH LAW 0. L
DECLARED TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL
BY COURT. ,
High Tribunal in En Banc Session
Also Upholds Constitutionality of
Webb-Ken yon Act.
Columbia, Oct. 14.?The gallon-anonth
law was held constitutional in
i decision rendered by the supreme
court en banc here tonight. The decision,
which was written by Associate
Justice Hydrick, upheld the
constitutionality of the Webb-Kenton
act passed by congress. The majority
decision was concurred in by
four members of the supreme court,
and eight of the circuit judges. A
iissenting opinion was filed in this
case by Associate Justice Watts,
wnicn was concurrea m Dy mree circuit
judges.
The case arose from Richland
county, entitled Brennen against the
Southern Express company and involved
the refusal of the express company
to deliver to the plaintiff more
than one gallon of whiskey ordered
for personal use a month.^ In his petition
the plaintiff attacked the constitutionality
of the Webb-Kenyon
[aw, and the gallon-a-month act, both
of which, ho,wever, are. declared to
be constitutional.
Majority's Opinion.
The majority opinion sets forth
that the legislature has the power to
limit the amount of whiskey which a
citizen may order for his personal use
and says such action is not in contravention
of the immunities and
privileges guaranteed to citizens by
the constitution of the United States.
It also holds that congress has the
power to withdraw interstate protection
from liquor shipments into
States which have laws against the
sale or., use of whiskey.

liquor, interstate in character, intended
by the party to be notified for
unlawful use, is subject to seizure
under the laws of South Carolina, before
delivery to the party for whom,
under certain conditions it is designed,
was the opinion of the en
banc session of the supreme court delivered
here tonight. The opinion
was written by Chief Justice Gary
and concurred in by Associate Justice
Gage and eight circuit judeges.
Associate Justice Hydrick wrote a
concurring opinion which was concurred
in -by Associate Justice Fraser.
A dissenting opinion was filed by
Associate Justice Watts which was
concurred in by three of the circuit
judges.
The case was entitled the Charleston
and Western Railway company,
plaintiffs-appellants, against Reubent
Gosnell, et al., defendants-respondents.
It arose from the seizure by
the Greenville county police of an
"order notify" shipment of liquor
consigned to certain parties in Greenville.
It was an action in claim and
delivery to recover possession of shipment.
Wilson's Neutrality.
Under much provocation and temptation
our government has thus far,
with great difficulty, maintained the
neutral attitude of the United States.
That was its highest duty, and it was
inevitable that in its performance it
would not satisfy either party to the
war or those who sympathized strongly
with either side. It was inevitable
that more or less of a mistake would
be made on account of human limitations
in foresight and judgment, but
there is doubt whether, with others
in command, the result would have
been better achieved. But there could
be no others in command and a position
has been maintained that may
give the United States far more influence
with both sides when it comes
to establishing and maintaining the
peace of the world hereafter than if
it had favored one side in the war
struggle and incurred the undying
enmity of the other. Better to displease
both in many details than tc
join one against the other, if we are
to take an effective part in securing
a league to enforce peace hereafter
Much will depend upon first seeing
a peace established in which the
seeds of war will not be implanted.?

FORMER SENTENCE EFFECTIVE.
Merchant Said to Have Violated Conditions
of Suspended Sentence.
Charleston, Oct. 12.?Judge Rice
late this afternoon handed down a
decision on the return of T. W. Mappus
ruling that the defendant had
violated the conditions of his suspended
sentence, and so must serve
six months on the chain gang. The
defendant gave notice of appeal, and
furnished bond in the sum of $1,000.
A sensation was sprung in court today,
when the Mappus case came before
Judge Rice in a return on an
order to show cause why the defendant,
T. W. Mappus, a merchant at
Four Mile, should not serve a suspended
sentence of six months on the
chain gang for violating the prohibition
law. He was sentenced last
June, by Judge Memminger, a fine of
$500 being paid, and six months left
to become effective if he violated the
liquor law again. Rutledge Rivers,
counsel for the defendant, attacked
the legality of the fall term of court
as well as the June term, on the
grounds that appointments of Judge
Memminger and of Judge Rice by the
chief justice to serve here were incomplete
under the new law, and he
also challenged the constitutionality
of the act creating Charleston county
as the Ninth circuit, on the ground #
that it deprived a defendant in this
_ _ A _ ^ 11. . ?.L.l ^ 4?
Circuit Ol ine rigiu in uaauge ui
venue, since he could not go to another
county in the same circuit for
trial, as was specified by the consti-.
tution, since there was only one county
in this circuit. Judge Rice overruled
his objections entered under his
plea. Judge Rice refused a jury
hearing in the Mappus case, declaring
that he felt it his duty to decide
the issues. ^ ? rl|P3
