I Where the boll weevil has
Jmade cotton crowing a -hazard
ous enterprise, the dairy offers
a sure and constant income.
Some farmers who are running
small dairies as side lines to their
regular farming find themselves
Jon a cash basis, the dairying tak
ing care of the running expen-
Fses, leaving the income from
crops to be used vfor permanent
improvements and luxuries.
The future for the daryman is
bright. -
To put Mississippi in its right
place is this busines, however, it
must be well planned and on a
firm basis. To properly conduct
a dairy business better barns are
necessary than for ordinary live
stock. Not necessarially expen
sive barns, but barns arranged
for light, ventilation and sanita
tion. The people who buy dairy
products are demanding that the
milk and butter come from clean,
sanitary barns and healthy cows.
In order that every Mississippi
farmer can get the latest infor
mation on barn construction, L.
A. Higgins and Daniels Scoates,
of the Mississippi A. and M.
College 'have just published a
bulletin on this subject. While
the supply lasts this bulletin will

the
Signature
Dyspepsia Man's
Greatest Enemy
Distressing Malady Has Baffled
the Medical Profession For
Many Years.
Explaining the record-breaking
demand for Tanlac, G. F.
Willis, southern representative
for L. T. Cooper, manufacturer
of the celebrated medicine, stat-,
ed recently in Atlanta that the
thousands of questions were be
ing asked all over the south re
grading it make it imperative
that some explanation be made
to satisfy the public interest.
At this point Mr. Willis quoted
from one of Mr. Cooper's recent
lectures, in which he said: "Of
all the distressing conditions
that afflict humanity, chronic
dyspepsia is probably the most
prevalent. Thi3 most universal
malady has baffled ' the medical
profession for years, ' and the
most skilled specialists have been
unable to cope with it success
fully. "Hours might be consumed in
describing the sufferings, mental
and physical, of the sufferers of
chronic dyspepsia and their fail
ure heretofore to get relief. A
morbid, unreal, whimsical and
melancholy condition- of the
mind, aside from the nervous
ness and physical suffering, is
usual condition of the average
dyspeptic, and life seems scarce
ly worth the living. Dyspepsia,
or indigestion, as case may be, is
caused by the taking of too much
food, or unsuitable food, and the
mucous membrane of the stom
ach becomes irritated, and there
is set an acute or sub-acute gas
tric catarrhal condition which
prevents the proper digestion of
the food. This food is apt to
ferment and decompose, and as
a result the familiar, distressing
symptoms of dyspepsia may arise
In mild cases there is nothing
more than an uncomfortable feel
ing in the stomach, with a cer
tain amount of depression, head
ache, loss of appetite, perhaps
belching of gas and occasional
vomiting. There may be also
accompaying intestinal symp
toms, such as constipation, pains
in the back, colic, etc. There
may be only the familiar ' heart
burn due to the inflimation of
the stomach from the excessive
gases of fermentation or putre
faction. In the most severe
cases those that last over a day
or two the symptoms enumera
ted may be much more intense.
The distress may be marked and
the general constitutional symp
toms more evident. When this
stage is reached the loss of ap
petite, the mental depression
and the general uncomfortable
feeling in the stomach are much
more pronounced. This is parti
cularly true in acute gastritis.
"It frequently occurs from
continued errors in diet that this
condition becomes chronic, and
the symptoms persist for an in
definate period; the appetite is
very apt to be varied, although
at times very good.' Heartburn
is frequent, if not constant; the
stomach is painful on pressure,
the tongue is coated, there is a
bad taste in the mouth, and
there are changes in the amount
of salivary secretion. Constipa
tion is also usually present, al
though diarrhoea may alternate.
"Most cases of dyspepsia can
be cured if the diet is properly
looked after and with the proper
treatment. Proper eating and
the proper amount of food are
the most important features in
the treatment. Most people eat
too fast and eat too much.
- x - -
"One of the most pernicious
of all practices in the treatment
of dyspepsia is the promiscuous
taking of so many of the so called -proprietary
medicines, which
are so blatantly advertised in(
the daily press, many of them
being nothing more than alco-j
holic beverages, and their use is
not unattended with a great
deal of danger. The treatment
of constipation that is so fre
quently an accompainment of
dyspepsia by means of patent
pills, calomel, powders and pur
gatives are harmful.
"I am convinced," continued
Mr. Cooper, "that the stomach
regulates the condition of the
blood and is the fountain head of
health or disease, as the case
may be. My medicine is inten
ded primarily for the regulation
of the stomach and the correct
ion of catarrhal inflammation,
but it is no uncommon thing for
persons who have used it to
come to me and explain that it
has relieved them of rheumatism
and many ailments not generally
recognised in having their origin
in stomach trouble."

The Old Home Singers
On the 13th, the Redpath Ly
ceum Course opened their 2nd
year at the Star Theatre. The
first number being "The Old
Home Singers," a musical enter
tainment conducted by two ladies
and two gentlemen, accompani
ed by a lady at the piano. They
went back down the line half a
century ago, and sung the old
music that our fathers and moth
ers used in that day. The pro
gram was composed of such
songs, as the Old Oaken Bucket,
Jaunita, Carry me back to Old
Va., Camels a Coming, Rocked
in the Cradle of the deep, Old
Black Joe, Sweet Alice, Ben
Bolt, Kathleen, Mavourneen,
Dixie, and Home Sweet Home.
It carried the older people back
down the dim aisles of J50 years
ago, and waked the new genera
tion to the difference between
the old time music and the new
fangled kind of today. The
hearts of those who love the
sweet strains, so full of melody,
of the olden tune, were touched
by the faultless rendition of that
trained choir, that seemed to en
ter into the spirit of every song.
Redpaths always brings some
thing chast and . entertaining.
An evening spent with them
always sends you home in a good
humor with yourself and neigh
bors. Don't miss the next one
at the Star Theatre.

If your back aches because the kid
neys are blockaded,
You should help the kidneys, with
tielr work.
Doan's Kidney Pills are especially
for weak kidneys.
Recommended by thousands home
testimony proves their merit.
W. H. Hall, shoe & harness repair
er, Church St., Okolona, says: "I have
been .severely injured in my back a
couple of times and I believe that was
the cause of- my kidneys giving me
trouble. Bending over at my work,
no doubt, helped to make my back
weak and painful. Several years ago
while living in Amory, I was bothered
that way and I used Doan's Kidney
Pills. They strengthened my kidneys
and my back stopped aching." '

simply ask for a kidney remedy get

In Memory
To the sacred memory of our
beloved mother, Mrs. Cornelia
Buckingham, who fell asleep in
Jesus Oct. 4th.
In the garden of our hearts,
Where the choicest flowers grow,
We cheerished there, a gorgeous
lily,
Beautiful and fair, and as white
as snow. .
But, our Savior needed a flower,
For His garden away up there,
So He sent His angel earthward
To bring Him one that was pure
and fair.
The angel came into our garden,
And beheld the lily white,
She gently plucked it from the
others,
And back to heaven took her
flight.
And we stood and watched the
lily.
For we loved it as no other,
And we'll miss it, yes, always
miss it;
For that lily was our mother.
Why should we weep for you,
dear mother,
For your earthly work was
through,
Up there in God's happy king
dom, He had work for you to do.
And we know you'll do it
mother,
For you never shirked your duty,
And your hands will ne'er grow
weary
In that land of wondrous beauty.
Ah! those hands my mother's
hands,
How we loved their gentle touch,
There were none in all this
world
That we loved more, and miss so
much.
While we miss you, our precious
mother,
You will be so lovely there,
Robed in garments pure and
spotless,
With a crown upon your hair.
How me miss the tottering foot
steps
And that sweet and precious face,
Yet, we will lean on God's true
. promise
For sweet comfort and plenteous
grace.
When we reach that celestial
throne,
We know .not now how soon
'twill be,
There among God's saints and
angels
Our mother's face again we'll
see.
When the holy angels meet us,
A3 we go to join their band,
Will we know ur dear good
mother
In the glorious Heavenly land?
Shall we see the same eyes shin
ing
On us, as in the days of yore?
Shall we feel the dear arm twin
ing
Fondly 'round us as before.
Two precious forms now sleep
side by side,
Andjclose to these two our hearts
doth hover.
One is the form of our dear good
father,
The other our own precious
mother.
