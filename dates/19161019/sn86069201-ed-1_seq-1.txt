fair notice that the ordinance prohibit

property owners would collect them in
piles at convenient places. We won

healthy the burning of leaves is to say
nothing of the disagreeable smell and
danger to property. See medical

a public speaker, was presented Mon

to listen to the convincing, arguments.
oratory and entertainment furnished by
Governer elect, Chas. H. llrough, of

and it may be said to his credit, one of
the fairest speakers his large and ap
preciative audience ever iisteued to,

were discussed by him in a most mas
terful manner. He did not criticise his
opponents in politics, but rather gave
them the credit of being as honest in
their;belief as is he himself. He did
not indulge in billingsgate but chose the
tho most refined and courteous terms
when referring to republican leaders
and voters. Gov, llrough is an orator
of no mean ability, and his audience
wus charmed and delighted with his
speech. Many times he would drift off
into flights of oratory and word-paint'
ing that were beautiful, and effective
in their application. "My wife is
Kentuckian" he said, "and all that I
am, or will ever be, is due to her.'
He paid many handsome and deserved
compliments to the town of Lancaster
and Garrard county, adding that he
felt sure that the voters would recog
nize the worth of their present chief
executive and the great service he has
done for the country at large. He pre.
dieted the election of President Wilson
by a big majority.
Gov. llrough has just returned from
an extended trip through the north
making campaign speeches in the in
terest of the present administration.
He said that the popularity of Mr. WII
son was increasing dally, even tli
states of Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin
would come Into the Democratic fold in
the November election.
The visit of Gov. llrough will be long
remembered by those who were fortu
nate enough to hear him Monday night.
He Is a genial, wholesoul scholarly
gentleman whs is well posted on the
political Questions of the day. He left
Monday night to All a series of en'
gagements throughout central Ken'
lucky. His tour will unquestionably
count many votes for Mr. Wilson and
