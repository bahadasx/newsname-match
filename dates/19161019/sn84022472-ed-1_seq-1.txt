Campaign of Abuse
LIKENS WILSON TO
PRESIDENT LINCOLN
Acting Pastor of United
Church to Change Vote
After Half Century.
Dr. Washington Gladden distin
guished clergyman and autnor, who
Just .now is filling the pulpit of the
United Congregational church in this
city, has been led by the' Republican
camnaism of vilification ' which he
likes to that waged against Abraham
Lincoln in 1864, to declare 'himself for
President Wilson's re-election.
Dr. Gladden's writing are character
ized by a spirit of broad tolerance.
He spoke in Bridgeport for the first
time last Sunday, and it is expected
'that he will remain here for several
weeks. He Is pastor emeritus of the
largest Congregational church in Co
lumbus, O.
Dr. Gladden cast his first vote ki
186 for Lincoln, and has voted for
every Republican elected to the pres
idency since. In 1912 he was a leader
in the Progressive movement.
"The ideals and principles of pro
gressive Democracy," he says, "are
better represented today by the Dem
ocratic party and its leaders than by
the Republican party and Its leaders."
In his statement made public through
the Columbus (Citizen, Dpf'Gladdeh fur
ther 'says. '
i'With Mr. Wilson's general concep
tion of political duty and responsi
bility in a Democracy I am In cordial
agreement. The moderation and ra
tionality exhibited by Mr. . Wilson in
the conduct of our national) . affairs
were almost universally recognized by
our people during the first year of the
war. When the election drew near the
caldron began to bubble. Those of us
who art4d enough to remember the
election of 1864 and tempest of vil
ification and accusation, which burst
upon the head of Abraham Lincoln
during the campaign preceding his
second election, know what to look for
in a time like this. ' ' , ,
"I wonder if a debate led by eminent
men, in v-hlch such a record as Mr,
Wilson has made can be reviewed by
his opponents without a generous or
appreciative' word, Is really good poli
tics. J wonder how many wavering
voters it has confirmed in their pur
pose to vote for Mr. -Wilson. I know
of one."
CONNECTICUT CO.
TO PURCHASE NO
MORE OPEN CARS
Pay-As-You Enter Type
; Will Gradually, Replace
v Old Type.
The Connecticut Co. will buy no,
open cars, according to the statement
of Supt. Chapman today. In the fu
ture the closed cars will be used in
summer and winter on the company's
lines througlfout the state. This pol
icy has 'been decided upon as a result
of experiments made by traction com
panies In various parts of the coun
try. It has been ' found that the open
cars, while comfortable on hot days,
are not popular with passengers dur
ing ' rain storms and on cool nights.
Another disadvantage is the large
amount of road space they occupy.
With the double running boards the
big open car Is much wider than the
closed variety. This feature brings
the Connecticut Co. Into frequent con
flict with the governing bodies of
towns and cities where it Is desired
to lay new tracks. The numerous
accidents on open cars is another ar
gument against their use. Passen
gers standing on the running boards
are often injured, thereby Involving
the company in costly litigation.
The pay-os-you-enter cars will be
the standard in use for all seasons.
Some now ones have . been ordered
which will be longer than the type
last .purchased but the general lines
will be the same. It will be possi
ble to keep these cool in summerVy
opening all windows and In winter
they will be comfortably heated.
The Connecticut Co. has found that
in many cities throughout the west
closed cars are used all the year. Of
course the company still has a large
number of open cars on hand .but
these will gradually be retired.

WAR TG
EOT
SUKR. OPINION OF
GERS ON
(Copyright, 1916, by the Associated
Press.)
British Front In France, Oct. 18,
via London, Oct. 19 The war will
last another year, according to the
consensus of opinion among the Brit
ish soldiers and their leaders. It is
also the opinion of the Germans, if
the views of prisoners count for any
thing. '
Befogs the grand offensive started,
a high authority informed the cor
respondent of the Associated Press
that the German line would not be
broken this summer and that slow
operations, wearing down the Ger
mans, would be inaugurated and
would probably last through another
summer. With the approach of win
ter conditions, which make military
movements difficult, this officer reiter
ated his prediction and, speaking of
the situation today, he said:
"We Know wha the German re
sources were and what ours were and
the time required to force a decisive
victory for our arms Is a matter of
calculation."
German prisoners taken during the
summer Invariably spoke of peace be
ing a certainty In the autumn. They
regarded the Somme thrust as a final
effort of the allies for a decision and
that after it peace would be made.
Their tone has been entirely different
of late. They recognize that it is a
fight to a finish between the man
power and resources of the two foes
and that an ultimate decision will
come from the fearful attrition on the
western front which now will know
no Intermission until the end. The
Germ.Vt are determined to make
every village on the western front a
fortress that will yield only when re
duced by powder and shell fire; every
gully and crater a machine-gun post
to secure their defensive against a
critical defeat. '

COLOGNE REPORT
Arming of All British Mer
chantmen to Make This
Step Necessary, is View
Berlin, Oct. 19. The Krleges Zei
tung prints a report that tile British
have issued an order to arm all merr
chant steamers and that as a result
Germany may be forced to take up a
sharper submarine campaign with
consequent endangerment of German
American relations, i It continues:
"If it is true" that England actually
intends to arm all its merchantmen
with heavy and therefore far-carrying
guns, and thus label them plainly as
warships intended for attack. It can
not be avoided that, whether we wish
to or not, we must give a sharper ten
dency to . our submarine campaign.
Submarines Are Active
Washington, Oct. 19. Despatches.
to the state department today report
the sinking of the British" steamer
Kennett by a submarine and the land
ing of the body of her captain. The
steamer Damia, presumably Norwegi
an, was reported sunk by A German
submarine, and the Swedish steamer
Norma was reported disabled south of
Drogden light vessel by her propeller
becoming entangled In nets stretched
by the Germans to trap submarines. .
Widow Begs Judge
on Bended Knee to

Falling on her knees in the court
room before Judge Frederic Bartlett,
Mrs'. Michael Zuzio, a widow from
'Brooklyn sobbed out her thankfulness
and extended her . blessings to the
judge for allowing her son, aged 17,
to return with her to Brooklyn.,.
The . dramatic scene followed ' the
pleas of the widowed mother and an
other son, to extend leniency to the
youth, who. coming to Bridgeport to
obtain work and assist in supporting
his mother stole a bicycle,- the prop
erty of H. Rosenberg, 434 Main street,
a (week ago.
Putting her arm on her son's
shoulder as he sat on the witness
stand, the mother In tearful accents,
told the court her son was a good
boy, that everybody liked him, and
she would answer for his future con
duct if he was allowed to return to
Brooklyn with her, the court grant
ing the request.
STEALS WASHING,
. If any housewife in Bridgeport
awoke yesterday morning to find her
fresh wflsh which she had hung on the
lines overnight, missing, it might
prove to her benefit to view the bag
of linen and underwear, which tlte
police found in possession of John
Brooks, a colored man. Brooks was'
arreste-t yesterday 'by a police officer,
who al'eges that Brooks Is a clothes
line thief. He had a fbaig. con
taining fresh washed linen and other
material, which was still wet, and
could not give a satisfactory answer
when asked where he got it.
OFF!
CONTINUE UNTIL
THE SOD
At a period when the weather as
adverse to operations elsewhere, the
Germans are .fcp.VrenNy concentrat
ing every possible man and gun
against Rumania. The view of the
British officers is that the Germans
hope to crush Rumania so that when
they have to face a common, united
offensive In the spring they may not
have to defend the immense length of
the Rumanian frontier in addition to
what they have had to defend this
summer,
It is a general remark among the
British that never has the morale of
the prisoners' varied more than now.
"You will notice that we are always
taking prisoners and the Germans
get very few of ours," said a staff
officers." Though small parties of our
men are bound to get into hazardous
positions in this kind of intricate op
erations at close quarters they die
rather than yield. This shows their
morale' and the temper of the situa
tion. Some Germans have never
fought better and some have never
fought so badly as in the last few
weeks. Today, for example, twenty
Germans practically threw up their
hands and walked into the British
lines. But the soldiers, who took
them prisoners or their commanders
had io illusion that these prisoners
typified the condition of the German
army as a whole. There were other
Germans who were ready to fight
with that ferocity which expects no
quarter." ,1
However, hether it Is B. German
who throws up his hands on th ap
proach of a British charge or the sur
vivor of a score who fought to the
death, the opinion as to the duration
of the struggle remains the same. All
believe that the war has entered a
stage where no compromise is to be
expected and where victory will go to
the side with the ability to stick the
longest. , ,
