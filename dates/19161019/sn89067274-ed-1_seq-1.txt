Former Member of the Audrain Coun

perience With This Official.
Ex-Judge J. D. Sutton, who was a
member of the Audrain County Court
when Audrain had a Highway Engin
eer, urges the voters to support the
movement to re-instate this official at
the coming election. His letter citing
actual savings made by that officer
an argument in favor of the offfl
which cannot be overlooked.
FARBER, Mo., Oct. 15. R. M.
White & Son. Dear Sirs: In reply to
your letter will say that I am for the
County Highway Engineer.
From my personal knowledge I
know that the Hon. J. J. Wakefield
saved this county many times his sal
ary while he was in office. When we
appointed Mr. Wakefield to the office
of County Highway Engineer the
road overseers in the county were
paying about $125 for the Austin
grader.
Mr. Wakefield got busy and he
bought this same grader for $G5, a
Baving of about $f0 on each grader.
I could give you many such cases
where the County Highway Engineer
saved the taxpayers money.
I believe if the people understood
this proposition as they should it
would carry by a big vote.
I hope the people will vote for this
proposition, because I know the High
way Engineer will save the county
money each year.
Yours for better roads,
J. D. Sutton.

Railroads to enter St. Louis from the
west, tentatively announced recent

Santa Fe officials admit they the
anxious to get into St. Louis to com
pete for the westbound passenger and
freight traffic, but it is contended that
plans for extending the line into St.
Louis as yet are vaguo and that ne
gotiations looking to the extension up

The Santa Fe runs northeast from
Kansas City to Carrollton and thence
direct to Chicago. From Carrollton
to Mexico, the western terminus of the
Burlington-owned track, is only 95
miles, so that the project does not call
for the construction of any great

Santa Fe would make a formidable
competitor in the St. Louis field,
where it could offer shippers excep-
