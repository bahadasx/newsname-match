CABINET DRAFTS PROTEST
Crowd Marches to American Legation
and Asks for Sympathy of
United States.
Athens, Oct. 19. The Greek cabinet
held a meeting today and drafted a
protest against the arrest of members
of the Greek reservist league by
French marines last night.
A parade of the reservists passed a
patrol of the marines who dispersed
the Greeks at the point of the bay

The strictest military measures
have been put in force to prevent lur

Athens. Oct. 19. After the demon
stration Tuesday against the entente
allies, timing which a procession of
several thousand persons marched to
the American legation and jtrotectt.il
against the landing of French ma
rines, a delegation of six persons
called at the American legation and
presented resolutions asking the sm
pathy and protection of the L'tu'.l
Slates against the encroachments ;f
the entente jtowers. The spokesman
said in English, in presenting the reso
lution: "Henry Clay's speech in re
gard to Greece's snuggle lor liberty.
as well as one by Daniel Webster, said
the struggle would have been made
meaningless if the liberties of
(J recce had been subsequently lost.'
The American minister, Garrett Drop
pers, promised to forward the jietition
to Washington.
There were about 5000 persons in
the crowd which marched to the
American legation carrying huge
American and Greek flags. Recent re
ports jtublished' in Greek newspapers
that an American flret of 3o war
ships was on the way to Greece in
spired the crowd to insist on seeing
Mr. Droppers although the legation
remained dark, the door was closed,
and no one answered the bell. For
several hours the fruitless attempt to
gain a hearing at the legation was
continued, with repeated cheers for
the United States. Unknown to the
crowd, the American minister and the
legation secretary were watching the
demonstration from windows of the
American club, directly oposite.
When it was seen at last that no
response could be had at the time
from the legation, a committee includ
ing an English-speaking Greek named
Kilkls formerly from Mississippi, was
lormed to wait upon Mr. Drojipcrs ar.d
beg him to put the case of 'i-eec-i be

Violent fighting is still in progress
in Cialieia, where, on the Narayuvka
front, the llacarians have stormed a
Russian position and captured 350
men and 12 machine guns. Ilrrlin
asserts that to the west of Lutsk, in
Volhynia, following the repulse of the
Russians, the troops of Kmperor Nic

and are merely bombarding the Teu

BISHOPS BAR WOMEN
Two Equal Rights Proposals Denied
at St. Louis.
St. Iouis, Oct. IS. Women were de
nied equal rights with men in two ac
Hons taken today by the House of
Itisbops of the Protestant Ejtiscopa.1
church.
A proposal to give women equal
rights with men in the convention was
sjtonsored by Robert 11. Gardiner of
Gardiner, Mo. A similar resolution Is
now on the calendar of the House of
Deputies, and. it was pointed out. to
day's action in the upper house does
not jireclude it be ins discussed by the
lower body. Since concurrence of the
two houses is necessary, in the event
the House of Deputies should approve
the projiosal it will go to the House of
Bishops for reconsideration.
Establishment of a permanent
church publicity bureau "because of
the Increasing dejtendency of Ihe
church on the press," was urged in a
regoultlon ndojtted by the House of
Deputies, it is to be acted on by the
House of Bishops. The bureau, accord
ing to tho jilan announced, is to study
means of getting the co-operation of
newspapers in carrying on the work
of the church.
TAXI TO THEATRE BANNED
Germany Wants Vehicles for More
Important Service.
Berlin (via London), Oct. 18 Ber-
liners in the near future will have to
endeavor to arrive at the theatres In
time without the use of automobile
taxleabs. It Is planned to forbid the
use of these vehicles for trips to and
from theatres, concert halls and other
places of amusement. The taxleabs
thus freed. It is hoped, will be avail
able to serve more important lur-
poses.
At the beginning of the war there
were 2. COO automobile taxiablc rim
ing in Berlin. This number has been
reduced to 800. and during the time be
tween the opening and closing of the
thPatres there has hardly ever been
a taxlcab to be had.
rines have been shown and the situa
tion still remains tense. An appeal
drawn up at a meeting of Greeks at
Athens has been handed to the Ainrri
can minister lor transmission to Wash
ington. It. asks the American peojile
"to avert the subjugation of those who
desire only to remain free."

No Mysterious Influences to Brood

Grand Rapids, Midi., Oct. 18. That
fling about invisible government has
made Charles E. Hughes mad clear
down to his shoe solos. He took great
jiains tonight in Grand Rapids to let
it be known that if he is elected Presi

"There was no invisible government

"If there is one thing that I never

FOR A COMMUNITY CENTER
School is Only Institution Which
reaches Into Every Home.
Prof. Peyser. Principal of Public
School No. Manhattan, writes in
terestlngly cf his experiences in mak
ing "The School the Community Gen
ter," in a recent number of The Sla
vey. As a reason why the school should
be the community center he says, "hi
the first place the school is the only
institution which reaches into every
home in the community. In the sec
ond place, it is the only agency which
realize the problem before the crisis
is reached, beforp the crash comes.
The charities receive the case only-
after the lowest level has been reach
ed, the hospital, alter there has been
a complete break-down; the police and
the courts, after the crime has been
committed. The school feels the prob-
blem before it is too late for the happy
solution.
"The school Is thus the pulse of the
community. Moreover, in this way the
school will be serving its truest func
lion, that of character development.'
Located in a section where there
were about three times as many cases
of juvenile delinquency and twice us
many felonies among adults as in any
other district of the city. Prof. Peyser
and those working with him have suc
ceeded in reducing the delinquent acts
among the children to almost none.
Tills seems a wonderful record when
it is considered that before, their work
began as high as 1.1 er Cent of the
boys in his district had court records,
some having been arrested as many as
eleven times.
To accomplish this ft was necessary
to investigate home conditions and as
far as possible to improve them. But
most of all. worthy things were sub
stituted for the unworthy In the chil
dren's lives. Prof. Peyser says truly.
"The child craves activity; lie must be
doing something all the time. Nearly
all the delinquency that Is found
among children represents misdirected
play. Boys and girls need athletics,
free play, dancing, the movies, indus
trial work, art work, music, dramatics
all those elements of active life
which make for wholesome develop
ment through uffording opportunities
for self-expression in directions which
society approves.
"We have organized athletic clubs
of all kinds walking clubs, roller and
Ice skating, basket-ball, hand-ball, run

baseball organizations. Folk-dancing
clubs for boys have been conducted by
the teachers of the school for the past
two years. A brass club, a burnt

work alter hours. The school has an

Between New York and
Chicago.
Syracuse, N. Y., Oct. 19. President
Wilson, on board his special train, was
greeted by cheering crowds at 10 New
York cities and towns during brief
halts made yesterday afternoon and
last night as ho passed through the
state on his way to Chicago to speak
there" today. In this city he got his
first glimpse during the campaign of
red lights burning in his honor.
The president refused to make ex
tended speeches at any of the stops,
but in' each town he thanked the
ciowds briefly for coming to see him.
At Albany he said: "I am a very poor
hand, my friends, at commending my
self. You all know just exactly what
has been done by the present admin
istration and you know just as well
as 1 do how to judge it, so that I am
perfectly content to leave myself in

The president's hand was shaken so
vigorously at Albany that the skin

shaking hands with the other. "It's
good red blood, anyway," called out
one man.

MILIATIAMEN HELD
Court Decision Says They Are Liable
for Federal Service.
Boston. Oct. 18. The United States
circuit court of- appeals ruled today
that state militiamen were still in
service for federal military purposes
notwithstanding their failure to take
the oath under the national defense
act of last June. This decision re
verses a recent order of the federal
district court. The case was, consider

The opinion, from which Judge Put
nam dissented, vacated a decree of ;l-.e
lower court under which Alexander M.
Emerson and Alfred P. Lowell, caval
rymen, were released from military
custody. Emerson refused to take the
new oath and Lowell asserted he had
subscribed to it under duress.
Had the lower court been sustained,

been necessary to discharge 40,000
guardsmen immediately.

NEW COLGATE ROAD
NOW COMPLETED
AND OPEN
Probably the Best Piece of Country
Road in Vermont
TOTAL COST IS NOT GIVEN
New Section Is Mile and Quarter in
Length and is Macadam Laid on ,
Telford Foundation. . 1
The new west end road from Antho
ny crossing to the state line was com
jileted Wednesday and is now oien for
travel. J. H. McCusker the contractor
has his men picking up his material
and will do a little work for Mr. Col
gate before leaving town.
This new road is a great asset for
Bennington and for this end of Ver
mont. When the short section in tha
Now York state side of the line is com
pleted it will mean a high class mod
ern highway all the way from Ben
nington to Troy, Albany and New
York.
The cost to the town of Bennington
has been very small. Three thousand
dollars was raised by subscription and
this added to what the town voted and
the state furnished made $10,000 and
the remainder of the money was iro
vided by J. C. Colgate who has already
done so much on the road west from
Bennington village. Bennington is
very lucky to get so much for so little
money.
The road is the best that can be
built. It is macadam laid on a telford
foundation. That is after the grade is
established a foundation of rough
stone is laid and above that are lay
ers of crushed stone gradually grow
ing finer toward the top and the two
upper courses being laid and bound in
tar and oil.
There is no such thing as a perma
nent road but the grade and founda
tion of this road are as enduring as
they can be made and the surface will
last for several years and then have
Co bp renewed.
Special attention has been paid to
the ditches and drainage which is the
place where most road builders fail.
The length of the new section Is a
mile and a quarter and the width of
the macadamized section is 16 feet,
but the sides are built up so the
available width is about 24 feet. There
are no bad grades and shoulders and
corners have been wholly eliminated.
The material for the road came from
Mr. Colgate's quarry on the road back
of Mt. Anthony and Mr. McCusker
says that this rock is splendidly
adapted to road building.
