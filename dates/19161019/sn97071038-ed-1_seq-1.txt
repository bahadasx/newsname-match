GLE TAX MEASURE!
0. E. Spence, Muster oT State Grange,
Calls It Oonflsc.it: n.
A few days ago a Portland paper
published an Interview of C. E.
Spence, Master of State Grange, in
which he was quoted as being unal
terably opposed to the Full Rental
Value Land Tax & Homemakers'
Loan Amendment (single tax), which
is to be submitted to the Oregon vo
ters on next election day, November
7th, He was quoted as saying that
this bill provides for the confiscation
of private ownership in land, and, as
most farmers' property consists prin
cipally of land, naturally they are op
posed to it.
The Tax Liberator for October con
tains an excellent article on the sub
ject by Mr. Spence. It is a strong and
unanswerable argument against the
measure. He closes his article by say
ing: "I believe that the Full Rental
Value Land Tax will take the land
and with it will go the improvements,
and with the improvements will go
the toil, the savings, and capital of
thousands of honest, industrious peo
ple who are living on and 'using' the
land, and who are not monopolizing
nor speculating in it."
"If I am correct in my conclusions,
this measure will injure the home
owner and home builder more than it
will the speculator and I shall vote
307 X No."

Tax Limitation Means Lower Taxes.
If there has been doubt in the mind
of any voter about the wisdom of the
Tax-Limitation amendment, it should
have'beeji removed by the events of
the past few days.
The budget of proposed expendi
tures for next year have been made
up by the State and by the City of
Portland. The budgets call for ex
penditures way in excess of anything
which has been attempted before.
Every State Institution has asked for
big increase in appropriations, ex
cept one. The one institution which
does not ask for an increase is the
East Oregon Insane Asylum, located
at Pendleton. Every other institu
tion asks for big increases. Do our
public offcials feel that the tax-payers
can afford to pay unlimited taxes?
What Is to become of the state if
this annual increase does not stop?
How can anyone afford to pay the tax
bills. It is an outrage to ask the
tax-payers for big increases in ap
propriations when it is so hard to
get money. Taxes should be decreas
ing these times, not increasing.
But there is one big consolation for
the tax-payer. It is unanimously ag-
reed that tax-limitation will carry by
an overwhelming majority. Every
one admits it. This simply means
that regardless of how high the state
Institutions or the legislature try to
increase our taxes they will fall.
There is a highwater mark above
which they can not go. They can
not make our taxes for next year
more than six per cent over this
year's taxes. The same Is true of
the city of Portland. If the Tax-Limitation
Amendment carries, and it
surely will carry, then the commis
sioners of the city of Portland will
have to reduce their proposed ex
penditures 10 per cent.
Tax Limitation is a measure which
has been initiated by the State Tax
payers League for the protection of
the Taxpayers. It will carry by a
big majority.

COMMERCIAL CLUB PRESIDENT URGES A
GENERAL ROAD STRAWiNG DAY FOR COUNTY
Editor, Gazette-Times: At a re
cent meeting of the Heppner Com
mercial Club, held Oct. 9, the under
signed was requested to write a brief
appeal to the people Interested to
make an effort to cover the roads with
straw in order to keep the roads from
being cut into deep ruts and chuck
holes. If a sort of straw-day could be de
signated by the County Court for a
bout two days before the end of the
present month and everybody would
assist, the roads could be Btrawed.
This plan was used for many years In
the Walla Walla country. Every
ody turned out the farmers, the busi
ness men, and even the ladies. The
ladles served lunches for the men.
The straw was usually donated bo
there was no expense except the haul
ing and placing. The roads in the vi
cinity of Walla Walla to this day
show the good effects of this work,

' Bazaar and Fancy Fair.
A great collection of useful as
well as fancy articles will be dis
played at the Bazaar and Fancy Fair
which will be held in the Masonic
building on November 16, 17 and 18.
The apron booth will contain aprons
of all kinds and descriptions; large
aprons, small aprons, useful aprons,
ornamental aprons. - In the towel
booth will be found everything to
please even the taste of the most
fastidious In toweling. The fancy
work booth will have every variety
of fancy work, in the baby booth
work articles for baby wear, dolls,
and toys may be purchased. In the
Irish booth, articles of Irish make
and manufacture will be displayed.
Irish eorchet, Irish lace, Irish pipes
and pistcards, books . dealing with
Ireland's history, tales of love and
sorrow. In the candy booth, fresh
pleaiunt . tasting home made candy
AK 'CSf farted with in exchange for
legal tender. The country store
will have a vast conglomeration of
articles to sell. You will find in it
apples, potatoes, fat sheep, second
hand books, used mdgizines and many
other articles to numerous to men
tion. The fish pond will provide a
musement for many others than the
diciples of Isaac Walton, and you
stand a chance of catching a sucker
on your line as a salmon. The parcel
post will have a Bale at a uniform
' T Parcels from all parts of the U,
S., and perhaps the colonies, and if
the war was not raging in Europe
doubtless there would be many par
cels from across the water. But in
any case there will be many and
various articles sold in the parcel
post. A booth where religious artic
les such as prayer books, rosaries,
etc., may be had, is another fea
ture of the fair. The basement of
the Masonic building will be put into
use for amusement features for the
men, and as Thanksgiving will be
close on hand, many will be able to
pick up material for a Thanksgiving
dinner. Sandwiches and coffeee will
also be served in the basement. The
fair will be held three days, Thurs
day, Friday and Saturday, November,
16, 17 and 18.

There will be a dance at the Star
theatre next Saturday night.
The soil has been changed so it does
not so readily reduce to dust.
It is out of the question for the
County Court to have the work done
as it should be done, but if everyone
would help a little, there would be an
enormous saving upon horses, wa
gons, and men, and the future ex
pense of repairing roads would be
made lighter. If this work could be
done before the roads cut up so as to
be almost all chuckholes, It would be
a fine thing. If every farmer who is
now hauling wheat would do as some
of them do, rake up the straw around
their wagons In the morning before
leaving town and throw it Into some
bad place on the road, that would
have a tendency to keep the bad plac
es from getting worse.
If you are In favor of a straw-day,
call up the County Judge and tell him
so. You are busy, and all your
neighbors are busy, but you will save
time by putting in a day or two at
this work. What say you?

SENATOR LANE SPOKE
Senator Harry Lane of Oregon ad
dressed the voters of this city at the
Star theatre Wednesday evening. He
poke in the interest of Woodrow Wil
son, democratic candidate for presi
dent of the United States.
Mr. Lane spoke but little on our
foreign relations but confined his re
marks mostly to progressive legis
lation which has been passed during
the last two years. Mr. Lane avows
that he himself had a big hand in
putting some of these measures
through.
In speaking of the Mexican trouble
Mr. Lane upheld the president saying
that the chief executive had pursued
the right course. "It Is not this
country's business" said Mr. Lane "to
nterfere with the affairs of our neigh
bors. Mexico is perfectly capable of
conducting her own affairs." He
then went on :j explain the condi
tions in Mexico and outlined presi
dent Wilson's plan for civilizing that
country. He had much to say for
the poor Mexicans butl ittle enough
for the American men, women and
children who had lost their lives
down south, both on this and the oth
er side of the border. Mr. Lane in
timated that American's were down
there for what wealth they could
take out of the country, and were
running a risk all their own by stay
ing there.
The speaker was greeted by a full
house on his visit to this city.

HUGH IS TOE
m FUR CRISS
Ex-Senator Chas. W. Fulton Points
Out Many Shortcomings of Demo
cratic Administration and Tells
People What To Expect
After War.
"The American people never fac
ed a greater crisis in a quarter of a
century than now and the Demo
cratic party has proven entirely in
competent to serve the best interests
of the people" said Chas. W. Fulton,
ex-United States Senator from Ore
gon in addressing six hundred vot
ers at the Star theatre in this city
last Monday night.
Since the Democratic party has
been in control of the government
the high cost of living has in creased
thirty-three and one-third per cent.
To more-fully show why this is the
cause, Mr. Fulton explained the work
ing of the free trade policy which was
inaugerated in 1913 under the Under
wood tariff bill. In 1913 this bill
was passed. This was ten months
before the war broke out in Europe.
At the time the bill was passed, this
country held in the balance of trade,
$600,000,000. After this law had
operated for ten months, industries
began to languish and our balance of
trade fell off $342,000,000, and the .
subsequent importation of foreign ,
made goods put factories out of busi
ness in this country. Millions of
men were thrown out of employment
and It was at this time that soup
houses in the larger cities were es
tablished to feed the unemployed.
The ex-senator from Oregon called
attention to the fact that the me
mory of the American people must
le short indeed if they have so soon
forgotten the conditions existing in
demorilized industries following close
upon tV.e inaugeration of Pa'dent
Wilson. During these ten montlw 60
per cent of the railroad mileage in
the United States went into the hands ,
pf the receivers and, there were 18,- i.
400 failures of different kinds in the "
industrial world.
Then came the war in Europe.
Millions of men marching to the bat
tle fields left vacant places in the fac
tories and there at once became a de
mand for products of one kind and
another which only this country could
supply. It was then that the demo
cratic prosperity first became appar
ent. Yet the oncoming industrial de
pression had gained such headway
that it took the fighting armies of
Europe more than a year to over
come the ever growing disaster.
After the war has come to an end
there will be a condition which this
country will have to meet that the
democratic party, ith Its free trade
policies will be unable to cope with.
The war demand for our products will
have Ceased. We will be forced to
meet a competion such as the world
has never seen before. The batter
ed nations of Europe will be striving
to regain their former standing in
the world of trade and commerce.
They will be better fitted to do this
through the education they have re
ceived in the school of hardship and
practical economy. It is then that
this country will need protection for
her industries as never before. It
is then that the republican party
with its policies of a strong protec
tive policy will be needed as never
before.
Mr. Fulton took up and dis ussei
at length the Democratic platform of
1912 and clearly showed how Presi
dent Wilson had repudiated his cam
paign pledges. Have the people be
come so blind by the cry of "he
kept us out of war" that they can no
longer see the namby-pamby vaccil
liating methods used by Mr. Wilson
and his party relative to these things.
It is here, that the Mexican situation
looms large as an administrative
blunder. Others were the single
term plank and the exemption of tolls
for American coastwise vessels and
that plank guaranteeing pretection
to American citizens at home and a
broad. In their platform, the demo
crats also attacked the preceeding ad
ministration and violently decried the
extravagance of republican rule and
the subsequent high cost of living.
Turning back through the pages of
brief democratic rule as recorded in
history is evidence enough as to
whether they have kept faith with
the people or not.
Mr. Fulton's address was interupt
ed at various intervals by the hearty
applauds of his audience. A strong
Hughes sentiment Is manifest.
Better secure a ticket now at the
Star theatre for "Thelma" before all
the best seats are gone. Seats on
sale at Box office beginning Friday.

sheepman was in the city this week,
