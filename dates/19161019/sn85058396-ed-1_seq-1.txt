Chicago, OcL 19. President Wilson
had a busy twelve hours before him
on the occasion of his visit to Chi

a high point in the local Democratic
campaign for re-election.
Arriving in the city shortly before
noon, his first engagement took him
to the Press club where he was the i
guest of honor at a luncheon at 1 1
o'clock. In the afternoon at 4 o'clock
he addressed a meeting of the Non-
Partisan Women's league, presided
over by Miss Ella Flagg Young, for

schools.
The president's principal address of

stockyards after which, at 11:45 p.

The streets along the way to the

handful of people tried to reach him
to shake hands.
Speaking before the Press club of
Chicago here today, President Wilson
declared lie regarded the campaign
"as a great interruption to the ra

BERLIN ADMITS
LOSS OF BREMEN
3ig Merchant Submarine Nov
One Month Overdue Fate
Is Unknown.
OFFICIALS LOSE HOPE
Project to Send U-Boatl
Freighters Regularly to j
United States Not j
Abandoned.
Washington, Oct. 19. Loss of the
German submarine merchantman Bre
men virtually was conceded today by
ranking Teutonic diplomats in posi
tion to be familiar with the move
ments of the vessel. The Bremen is
now one month overdue.
It was admitted that German offi
cials not only in this country, but in
Berlin, were without information as
to the fate of the Bremen. All they
know is that she set out for America
from Bremerhaven and that she
should have arrived at an American
port soon after the middle of lasr
month. It is regarded as doubtful
that accurate information concerning
the fate of the vessel will be avail
able until after the close of the war,
if then.
The disappearance of the Bremen
will not cause abandonment of the
project to send merchant submarines
regularly from Germany to the Unit
ed States, it was said. There ap
peared to bo reason to expect that an
other submarine sea freighter, either
the Deutschland or some other, would
reach an American port some time
within the next month.
German officials in Washington do
not believe the Biemen could have
fallen into the hands of the British
unless she had some accident to her
machinery. They pointed out that
unlike naval submarines, merchant
submarines avoid all localities fre
quented by shipping and, therefore,
are not open to tho same risks.
Hopes Have Dwindled.
When the Bremen was a week over
due, no anxiety regarding her was
felL The Deutschland was just a
week overdue when she came through
tho Virginia Capes and the weather
conditions then were much better
than those which have prevailed dur
ing the last month and a half. When
the vessel was two weeks overdue
anxiety was apparent in various Teu
tonic quarters and word of her ar
rival was anxiously awaited.
Since then hope that the submar
ine might bo safe has dwindled each
day and today she was spoken of as
having been losL

THUT
Eccles Children to Be
Taken If Money Is
! Not Given.
In the belief that the gun battle
between the authorities and the ban
dits in the vicinity of the Riverdale
bridge last night might prove the be
ginning of a series of attempts at
extortion such as characterized the
blackmailing cases of a few years
ago, officers of the police and sher
iff's departments went to the scene
of the shooting this morning to search
for clues that would help them round
up the desperadoes.
Only a few empty shells discharg
ed from sawed-off shotguns in the
hands of tho officers, the bark of
trees' scarred by shot and marks In
the ground, vhere apparently, two
men had sat down to wait, remained
s evidence.. thata.renl encounter had.
taken place. The marked spaces on
the ground, together with a few emp
ty shells were found by O. II. Mohl
man, sergeant in tho police depart
ment, who, in company of Patrolman
Grant Syphers, made an examination
of the battle area this morning. An
empty shell found by Sheriff DeVine
near the spot where the first shot
was fired was taken as evidence that
the desperadoes wero armed with
sawed-off shotguns.
The battle was the outgrowth of the
attempt of the authorities to block
the efforts of the bandits to obtain a
sum said to amount to $10,000 from
David C. Eccles, head of the Eccles
estate, by a covert threat, which was
construed to mean the same as death.
The threat was conveyed by one
of the bandits in a telephone conver
sation, Monday evening. Tho bandit
demanded that Mr. Eccles deliver the
money at an appointed place, warn-
(nc Vilin flint cliniilrl Vin fnil 1r rnninlr
he "would never live to enjoy his
money."
It was also reported that the ban
dits threatened to kidnap two of Mr.
Eccles' young children.
Refuses to Talk.
Mr. Eccles would neither confirm
nor deny this when questioned this
morning. In a telephone conversa
tion, he said he did not wish to make
any comment on tho ease, as all the
information was now In possession of
the polico and sheriff's departments.
He said the authorities could use their
discretion with the facts as they had
been given to them.
Sheriff T. A. DeVine, who, with
Deputy Oren Hadlock and Robt Burk,
Robt. Chambers and Alex Fife of the
city detective force, engaged the ban
dits in the gun battle, said he had no
information that the desporadoes had
threatened to abduct Mr. Eccles' chil
dren. With the idea of entrapping tho
blackmailers, the authorities journey
ed to the Riverdale bridge shortly af
ter 7 o'clock last night Sheriff De
Vine took a position in tho brush of
the Riverdale "jungle" a short dis
tance from the cast end of tho bridge.
Detectives Burk and Fife took up the
watch beneath tho bridge at the east
end, whero a sack was deposited from
the Eccles' automobile a short timo
afterwards. This sack was stuffed
with paper. I
Detective Chambers and Deputy
Sheriff Hadlock crossed tho bridge
and proceeded south along the tracks
of tho Oregon Short Line to an old
house. From this place it was be
lieved tho bandits did thoir telephon
ing. Moro than an hour passed without
developments. Between the hours of
9 and 10 o'clock, shot was fired from
tho thicket near the east end of tho
bridge. Tho shot was believed to
have been discharged from a shotgun
In tho hands of one of tho bandits.
Part of the discharge struck a spot
between the place where Sheriff De
Vine wns concealed and tho end of the
bridge. Shot also were hoard to rat
tle ngninst tho bridge work.
Nono of the officers at the east end
of tho bridge moved. They believed
that to do so then would have meant
that they' would have been exposed
to a probable murderous flro rrom tho
darkness of the thicket without an
even chance for their lives and that
tho opportunity for capture would
have beon lost.
Hearing the discharge of the gun,
and believing it to bo a signal to
abandon their station in the old house,
Officers Chambers and Hadlock start-
I wvvwwwv
ed on the return to the bridge. They
crossed over without incident. Join
ing the other officers at the east end
of the bridge, they were Informed that
the shot had been fired from ambush.
The bandits apparently overheard
the conversation that ensued, and.
tired of waiting, opened fire upon the
officers as the five moved toward the
center of the bridge. The officers an
swered with a volley, each being
armed with sawed-off shotguns and re
volvers. They directed the fire at the
flash of the guns in the hands of tho
bandits. Shot rattled over the trees
and peltered the bridge. When the
authorities found the shotguns not an
effective weapon, they resorted to
their revolvers. The bullets must
have clipped close to the bandits, as
the desperadoes started retreating
Into tho dense growth of the thicket,
returning an occasional shot as they
ran.
In all from 16 to 20 shots were ex
changed. Nono of the sheriff's posse
was wounded. Shot, they declared,
whizzed by, uncomfortably close and
hit the ground about them.
In the belief that it would be use
less to give pursuit through tho
"jungle" the officers returned east on
the road toward the city. They turned
westward at the first road intersec
tion, an officer being stationed at va
rious points along -the line. By this
plan the sheriff aimed to establish a
cordon about the thicket in which the
hnnrWs were hnlleved to bo hidinc.
Finding no further evidences that the
men were in tho "jungle," the authori
ties returned to the city.
Dan Roman, a farmer residing in
the Riverdale vicinity, said today that
he found evidence where two men had
slept in a haystack on his place last
night.
Neither polico nor sheriff officers
had received this report. They said
the report, with any other possible
clues, would be investigated.
Recalls Martin Case.
Not since the days of tho Martin
blackmailing cases has so much ex
citement been created In the 'police
and sheriff's department. While estab
lishing no direct connection between
the operations of the gang of which
"Martin 'was believed to have been
a part and tho attempt at extortion
from Mr. Eccles last night, the author
lties are convinced that the failure
of the bandits to accomplish their
purpose last night will result in fur
ther extortion attempts, such as char
acterized the Martin cases.
Joseph Henry Martin, who was be
lieved to havo ben the leader of the
blackmail gang that terrorized
wealthy residents in the city for a
period of more than three years, is
now in the state prison, serving a
a five-year sentence for the shoot
ing of David Edwards, the PInkerton
ueiecuve, on me nignt oi iovemuer
17, 1913. This shooting occurred
while Edwards was impersonating L.
R. Eccles in a fake delivery of money
demanded from him. Edwards at the
time was endeavoring to trap the
blackmailers, who were charged with
damaging the homo of Mr Eccles,
2545 EccleB avenue, on the night of
November 3, 1913, by an explosion of
giant powder.
Later Martin wns brought back from
tho penitentiary to be tried on the
charge of highway robbery in connec
tion with the robbery of Mrs. Mc
Laren Boyle Wallin of a diamond ring
valued at $100. Tho robbery was ef
fected on the night of October 2S, 1911,
when the blackmailers gained an en
trance to the home on the second at
tempt. Mrs. Katherlne Culver was another
victim of the blackmailers, who se
cured from her a set of diamond ear
rings valued at $500.
Included in tho indictments against
Martin was one in which he was
charged with robbery of Lee C. John
son and John Lambert of $1,000 on the
canyon road the night of, April S, 1913.
Johnson and Lambert at tho time wero
detectives engaged in running down
the parties who had made extortion
demands on Mrs. R. E. Bristol.
Another indictment, in the files in
the office of John C. Davis, district
attorney, who with E. O. Leatherwood,
conducted the prosecution of the
cases, charged Martin with extorting
$300 from Mrs. Thomas D. Dee on
May 1, 1913.

DENIES WAR CHARGE
Declares Vote for Him Is Vote

Citizenship.
Saginaw, Mich., Oct. 19. Charles E.
Hughes delivered two speeches here
and at Bay City before audiences that
packed the halls where he spoke. The
nominee assailed the administration
for the Underwood tariff and the
Adamson law and repeated his denial
of the charge that a vote for him
meant a vote for war.
"Men are going abroad in this
land," Mr. Hughes said, "saying that
a vote for mo is a vote for war, be
cause I have criticised weakness and
vaccilatlon on the part of the admin
istration. A vote for me is a vote for
permanent peace based on self-respect
and the esteem and respect of others.
Nominee Man of Peace.
"We have but one desire and that
is an intense desire to go along in
our own peaceful pursuits, promoting
our prosperity and having a just dis
tribution of the gains of labor, by hav
ing a prosperity upon which wo can
build a structure of social justice.
Everyone desires peace. No one more
than I. Why, I have devoted all my
life to the institution of peace, insti
tutions that deal with a peaceful set
tlement of international controversies.
"But in this world you have got to
maintain not only your security by
preparation against every emergency,
you have got to maintain your secur
ity by winning the confidence and es
teem of other nations. We cannot do
that i we do not maintain th dignity
of our own citizenship.
"If you want to know the way
things ought not bo done, look at the
way in which they were done In Mex
ico. That, to my mind, is an illustra
tion that stands out in bold relief of
the policies of this administration. It
was meddling with matters that did

CIARD LINER
SUNKJY MINE
Steamship Carrying Passen
gers From New York to
London Goes Down.
New York, Oct. 19. The Cunard
liner Alaunia has been sunk by a
mine In tho English channel between
Falmouth and London, according to
cable advices to the Cunard line here
today.
The Alaunia called at Falmouth on
Tuesday and was on her way to Lon
don when she struck the mine some
time this morning.
The Alaunia sailed from this port
October 7 with passengers, but the
Cunard lino officials believe that they
were all landed at Falmouth, accord
ing to the usual custom.
Cantain Benison and some of the
crew were saved, according to the
cable message, but some are missing.
The Alaunia crow numbered 250.
When she sailed from New York she
carried 1S5 cabin passengers and 58
steerage, of whom a few were Ameri
cans. The Alaunia was a comparatively
new boat, having been built in 1913.
She was 520 feet long and had a gross
tonnage of 13,405, was 64-foot beam
and a depth of 43 feet.
The text of tho message received
from the Liverpool office of the Cun
ard line indicated that there wero
some passengers aboard, but that they
wero saved. It read:
"The Alaunia struck mine in Eng
lish channel this morning. Sunk dur
ing the forenoon. Passengers and ma
jority of crew saved. Several miss
ing." ' Tho Alaunia carried a cargo of mer
chandise including war supplies of 10,
000 and 12,000 tons and her voyage
from Falmouth to London was for the
purpose of discharging the cargo at
tho latter place.

WHEAT KEEPS I
ON ADVANCING I
Public Confronted With Fur- H
ther Rise in Price of Bread M
Flour $9.50 a Barrel.
Chicago, Oct 19. The public Is
confronted with another increase in ill
the price of bread, if wheat continues ll
to advance, according to predictions
today of leading bakers. H
The 10-cent jump in the price of ;fl
wheat in the last two days sent flour "H
up 75 cents a barrel, which caused the H
big bakers to announce that in addi- H
tion to the recent increases in the H
price of bread, they would have to H
make further advances unless some- iH
thing unforeseen lowers the price of f'H
flour. Bakers paid $9.50 a barrel jH
wholesale for flour yesterday, tho
highest price in Chicago in 20 years.
"Unless an embargo on the expor- lM
tat ion of flour and wheat is declared,"
said Paul Schultz, a prominent baker,
"there will bo a wheat famine before il
spring. Even as the situation is now, PH
small millers are shutting down their 111
plants and filling their orders by buy- W
ing fron the Minneapolis mills."
"If wheat goes up, flour goes up," H
said B. H. Dahlheimer, president of HI
the Master Bakers' association, and HI
we must increase the price of bread HI
or decrease the size of the loaf in or- H
der to live." II
