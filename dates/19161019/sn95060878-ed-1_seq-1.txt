BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE, Oct.
19. The war will last another year,
according to the concensus of opinion
in the British trenches today. It is
also the opinion of the Germans if
the views of prisoners count.
. Before the grand offensive a liih
authority said the German line can
not be broken this summer, and the
slow operations' for wearing down the
Germans to be inaugurated will pron
ably last through another summer
An officer today recalled the predic
tion and said: "We know what the
German resources were, what ours
were, and the timerequired to force
a decisive victory for our arms' is a
matter of calculation."
German prisoners during the sum
mer invariably spoke of peace as a cer
tainty in the autumn. They regarded
the Somme thrust as a final effort of
the Allies for a decision, and after it

peace would be made. Their tone is eng
tirely different of late. They rec
ognize that it is how a fight to a fin
ish between man power and the re
sources of the two foes and that ulti
mate decision must come from the
fearful attrition on the western front,
which now will know no intermission
until the end of the war.
The Germans are determined to
make every village a fortress which
will yield only when reduced by pow
der and by shell fire and every gully
will be a machine gun post to secure
defense against the critical defeat.
Now when the weather is adverse
elsewhere the Germans apparently are
concentrating every man and gun
against the Rumanians.
It is the view of the British that the
Germans hope to crush Rumania so
that when they face the common allied
offensive in the spring they will not
have to defend an immense length of
Rumanian frontier.

ARIZONA, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19,
(Special to the Yuma. Daily Examiner.)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct. 19... The Re
publican state committee today made
public the results of a careful analysis
of Senator Ashurst's record of bills
introduced and passed, and the dis
closures fail altogether to harmonize
with the claims put forth by the sen
ator since he began his campaign
in the state.
It will be recalled that when the
senator returned to Arizona a few
weeks ago, there werepublished cer
tain cartoons presumably prepared
under his direction in the east which
depicted the young senator as about
the whole thing at Washington.
For example, one of these pictures
represented Mr. Ashurst sitting . at a
desk, smiling blandly, the line, "My
Record" embrazoned at the top of the
picture. Surrounding him was a list
of practically all the important laws
enacted by congress during the six
years which the senate has been
graced by Mr. Ashurst.
The implication would be that the
senator fathered and passed these
bills, and undoubtedly the senator ex-
I pected that this particular cartoon
would convey the notion that readers
would note the list of laws enacted
and say ' See what Ashurst did."
The facts are, as disclosed by min
ute analysis, that of the one hundred
and four bills introduced by Senator
Ashurst during his six-year term, only
ten have become laws. The list oi
his bills that were passed is so short
that it is easily reproduced and it fol
lows: Bill No. G308 To authorize leasing
! of ceded Indian lands in Idaho for the
production of oil and gas.
Bill No. 531G For survey and sale
of certain public lands in Coconina
county.
Bill No. 2412 To increase the pen
sion to Fred b. Bush.
Bill No. 311-1 To increase the pen
sion to John Lively.
Bill No. G75 To increase the pen
sion to Alice I. Simpson.
Bill No. 2500 To adjust the rights
of settlers on the Moqui and Navajo
Indian reservations.
Bill No. 57G9 To increase the pen
sion to Joseph E. Burton.
" .Bill No. 353G To provide for stor
ing and cleaning of imported Mexican
peas.
Bill No. G748 To maintain Indian
schools without restriction as to an
nual expenditure per pupil.

big fellow bent forward and sent his
forceful answer thrilling through the
attentive listeners.
