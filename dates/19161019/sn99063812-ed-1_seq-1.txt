of the great new Elephant Butte, dam
was turned today. 280,000 acres of
fertile land In the chain pi viueys in
New Mexico, Texas and Old Mexico
were added to our acreage. The dedi
catory exercises were held here at the
dam, about 125 miles up the river
from El Paso and about 17 Similes
below Albuquerque, and markedthe,

The Elephant Butte dam Is a mass
of concrete and steel thrown across
the IHo Grande River on the desert ot
"Now Mexico at the point wnere a
gienl rock, shaped like a mastodonlc
elephant, seems to drink from the Rio
Grande. This giant impounding dam
has formed the largest Irrigation res
ervoir In the world. More than forty
five miles in length and eight miles
across, the, lake stores me meueu
snows of the Colorado and New Mex

spillways of the dam when the land

At tho conclusion of the elaborate

Piiinn ronercss was held at the dam.
"Tho dedication of Elephant Butte
dam today Is an event of world wide
Importance, said James G. McNary,

Southwest, who have staked their all
on tho fertility of the soli and the
ability of the project td carry waters
to tho lands when most needed. It
will lewnrd tho pioneer men and wo
men of the lower Rio Grande valleys
