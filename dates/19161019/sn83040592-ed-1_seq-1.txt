VOLUME XXXV
BAXTER SPRINGS. CHEROKEE COUNTY, KANSAS. THURSDAY, OCTOBER 19, 1916
RY; '-EXTENSION
President Makes the Announcement
that Company Will Start at Once -tb
Build from Galena to
Baxter Springs.
The extension of the Southwest
; Missouri Ioterurban railway from
Galena to Baxter Springs has
been authorized.
This information was given
oat Tuesday by A. H. Rogers,
president of the company, while
in Baxter Springs in company
with a party of officials composed
ofE. J. Spratt, superintendent
and T. A. Earbaugh, director.
In the party also were William
Hand, of Kansas City, district
manager of the General Electric
company, his engineer, M. M.
Boggess and A. A. Tracon, presi
dent of the Midland Bridge com
pany, of Kansas City.
Mr. Rogers stated that work
on this extension would begin
forthwith and be hoped to have
the cars running to Baxter
Springs within eight months.
Asked regarding the further
extension of the line from Baxter
through the mining towns south
of us. Mr. Rogers stated that
the big problem was to build
from Galena to Baxter including
the bridge across the river. From
Baxter south and west would be
an easy matter. He left it for
one to draw his. own conclusion
that once here the line would go
right on to the mining district
; A remarkable feature of the
announcement from Mr. Rogers
is that there are no strings at
tabbed. His company asks for
no bonuses whatever from any of
the towns. He will simply ask
for franchises and the good will
of the public in the matter of
securing right of way, etc
Several different propositions
have been presented to this city
by prospective railroad companies
and promoters but our council
has avoided making agreements
with any of them, holding to the
belief that as toon as practicable
Mr. Rogers would give as the
railroad line so badly needed, and
that too without exacting tribute
from the city. It is now proven
that the council acted wisely.
Mr. Rogers word is as good as
his bond and his bond would be
good for any amount.
Baxter's future is now assured.
We soon shall have an interurban
line of the first class, adequately
financed and officered by high
class men.
We hire heard knockers (every
little town has them) complain
that an interurban lint would
hurt Baxter.
Within the past two months
Mr. Rogers and bis associates
have invested close to $50,000 in
Baxter business property. He
knows what will happen to
Baxter, and if the coming of the
railroad meant anything but
prosperity does any one suppose
he would take on such large in
vestments here. -
On account of recent trouble
with film companies the Majestic
theater has taken up a contract
with a new film corporation the
General film company. Mr.
Reahms will show nothing but
high class pictures. He has an
up to date house cooled in sum
mer and warmed in winter.
The Baxter high school had
three guests of honor Tuesday.
They were Rev. and Mrs. Browne
and Rev. Craig who is visiting
the Brownes. The reverend
gentlemen gave talks that were
full of sound reasoning. The
high school students glad to bear
such talks and welcome anyone
willing to give them.

Jibnrrr Hall Available.
A new, steel fire escape has
been installed by the city council
on the library building. It ll not
a thing of beauty and by no means
a joy forever to our librariia who
objects to having the light shut
out from the window nearest the
reading table, nor does its con
spicuousness meet the approval
of the artistic eye of some of the
lady patrons who feel that the
"thing" should have been placed
at the back end of the building
"where it belonged" and where
some say the law says it must be
erected. Nevertheless the new
fire escape complies with the
state law as far as furnishing
adequate exit in case of fire is
concerned, and for that we all
should be tbtnkful, for in the
second story of.the library build
ing is a fine little hall, seating
about 300 and fitted up with a
stags. . Beciuse of the lack of a
fire escspe it was condemned for
public meetings some time ago
and has since been idle. Now it
is available for entertainments
and The News hopes it will be
used frequently during the winter
season. Preparations ougut to
begin now for some home talent
shows and musical programs.
Baxter has the talent, some en
terprising young folks to make
the start is all that is needed.
Why not organize a dramatic
club and stage two or three plays
through the winter. A few good
lectures could be made to pay.
The community life of Baxter
needs such entertainments and
since we have a very suitable
ball, why not have them. We
can't get along altogether on
picture shows.

Coet-af Sewers. -
C M. Cooper, county surveyor
and city engineer of Columbus,
vu In the city Monday. Mr.
Cooper is a candidate for reelec
tion as county surveyor and
called at the News office to order
his card inserted in the paper.
While here the editor took occas
ion to pump" him for a little free
information regarding the cost of
a sewer system in Baxter. Mr.
Cooper volunteered an off band
estimate of $35,000 as the total
cost of a first class sewer service
to cover the central part of town
and serve perhaps one-third of
the population. This would in
clude the disposal plant which
the law now requires and which
would make up a large part of
the total cost This would ran
between $15,000 and $20,000 de
nttirlinar noon the nearneaa of
suitable mat 1 such as gravel,
etc. It wot also include the
mala sewer ,ding through the
district another . $15,000 Mr.
Cooper thought ought to put
sewers practically all over the
city. It would not be as expen
sive as in many places because of
the good drainage which would
permit the use of much smaller
pipe. In most cities Mr. Cooper
says the city bonds itself for the
money with which to build the
disposal plant which is built out
of the general fund and the cost
of mains is assessed to property
benefited and payments are
strung out over a period usually
of twenty years, which makes the
payments very easy.
The News has had a good deal
to say in favor of sewers. This
improvement must be made before
Baxter will enjoy any consider
able growth, because people like
ly to come here nearly all insist
on living in a town affording
modern: 'conveniences 'and -good
sanitation. '
Practically all leading property
owners favor sewers ;. and we
understand the city council is
favorable. What, then, is to
hinder miking a start?
