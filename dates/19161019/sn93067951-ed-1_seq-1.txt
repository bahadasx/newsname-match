MORAL LESSON IN GREAT v
PROBLEM PICTURE ,
thu
The girl was born to crime. Iler m:u
father was in prison, serving a long ')'"1
term sentence; her mother died when nv
the husband and father was caught j 11 '
red-handed stealing to obtain money I ft,;"
. for medicine, that the mother might I 'M
live a few ilays itiore. Left to the ; P
tender mercies of fate and a boon ^,a
companion of the criminal father, the Sin
girl was given a post-graduate course r\
in pocket-picking. boo
She was arrested and brought into <jay
the police station just at the moment aflt
that George Devereaux, the District
Attorney, had called to claim the first Mrs
criminal he could lay his hands on as ,j<,h
a subject for an experiment in crimi- Lul
nology. I)av
Devereaux claimed that he could, C
by proper education and the bent <it tab]
of improved surroundings, save from
a life of crime any child that had s r\
been born and bred in a criminal at- wor
| mosphcre. And so the girl's future rati
I was directed into pleasant places, the thci
child to be schooled for her final bet- be s
torment and well-being. A
This is the digest of the story con- t on
| stituting the basis of "The Great I in i
Problem," to be the attraction at the * itn
Amus-U Theatre next Saturday night, bet\
with Violet Mcrscreau playing the Her
stellar role. Lionel Adams is her are
leading man, and they present a grip- uset
ping story in fast moving1 scenes of I vs
exceptional interest. van
Just how the "experiment" works croj
out might better be left for the ob- fl ml
server to witness first hand, for it is * jpj
i sure to detract from the interest of a bac<
film story if given complete. How- B
ever, there can be no great harm done b<u):
in declaring here that the author finds a.IV
a happy ending and in spitb of the c> pt
sodden and crime-soaked start, the b. t\
play soon works into pleasanter M
scenes, leaving a happy impression at the
the close. is nr

Boosters En
Chesterfield County's big County y
Fair Booster trip swung round its b
ninety-mile circle Tuesday on sched- tl
ule time.
It was a joyous and enthusiastic s:
crowd of nearly 100 boosters that f<
pulled out from the county seat a h
few minutes past 8 a.m. and dived in- b
to the dust of Chesterfield's high- c?
ways. They breathed dust; they ate
dust; they accumulted it in their eyes (,1
anu ears; but their enthusiasm was ni
not smothered nor suffocated. A more r
| loyal abrogation of royal boosters
1 never burned up the public highways j:
! than this bedusted group of Chesterfield
County citizens. jj
Getting away a few minutes late, n,
the stay at Cheraw was necessarily w
short, but from that on the trip was jn
made on schedule time, or better. s,
Speeches were made at all of the til
stops save one, there being fairly st
good-sized crowds on hand to welcome
the boosters. tli
The principal speakers were Secro- at
tary Hunley, Hon. W. P. Odom, Mes- al
srs. I. P. Mangum, B. J. Douglass, F. ct
W. Kivers and D. H. Laney. to
The sneakers all stressed the fact ti
that the Fair is a County Fair and
not a coutt iiousc town affair, that it th
was run by public-spirited men in the fo
interest of Chesterfield county as a g!
whole, seeking to favor no one section
above another. b<
The fact was brought out again at
that this Fair Association is unique in
that no dividends will ever be de- .lt
elared on the stock. Those who took ' ar
stock in this association did so know- , ce
ing that it was not to be a money- (th

eiation for expenses, improvements lu
and the awardin.tr of prizes. There to
is hardly another county fair in the 111
State giving as many and as large
cash prizes as tin.' Chesterfield County pi
Fair. ca
Mr. Odom's quips and Mr. Man- ft
gum's jokes never failed to provoke j
laughter. | le
Mr. F. \Y. Rivers, "one of the best II
farmers in the t unity," had a special CI
na sage for his hearers. It was a I?
ehn.icit.ire to contest for that big $-"> ft
prize for the best general display A

At McBoe, owing to a misunderinding,
the procession pulled ^ut a
;w minutes too early. The school
ad turned out to meet the boosters,
ut they left as the children were
>ming out.
It was a dusty and hungry crowd
lat rolled into Macedonia a few <
linutes ahead of the schedule time
>r dinner.
It is right here that the writer feels
ke giving up in despair of doing the
ibject justice. All those people who
:ive ever partaken of a picnic dinsr
at Macedonia know what
e mean. It would take a gifted pen
ideed to do justice to the handsome
read the good ladies placed before
is hungry aggregation, one hundred
ro:ig.
Consider first the table on which
io dinner was spread. It was estimed
that the legs alone were worth
out $1,000, being made of 18Mi
r.t cotton in bales. The food on
p was estimated to be worth many
mes as much.
When this crowd was well-filled
ere remained enough untouched
iod to satisfy another such an ag egation.
Macedonia made a hit with the
>osters, who hope they left as good
i impression as they received.
On the remainder of the trip, at
