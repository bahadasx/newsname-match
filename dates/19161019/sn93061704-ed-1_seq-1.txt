FIVE CARS BEANS
SHIPPED LAST WEEK
Wet Weather Interferes with
, Threshing and Maul
ing FOUR MORE CARS
ARE NOW LOADING
With Orders on File for Twenty
Cars during next Ten
Days
In spite of the wet weather and con
sequent heavy roads, five carloads of
beans were billed out from the local
Santa Fe station during the past week.
This brings the total to date to twenty
cars, representing a cash value of over
$40,000.
Four cars were being loaded yester
day, and Agent Copeland informs us
that he has orders for two cars per
day for the next tt-n days now on file.
As the roads are becoming more set
tled, so the farmers can bring in the
beans, and the price of beans advanc
ing the shipments will increase during
the coming weeks.

82,400 founds from 80 Acres
We have just secured final figures on
the eighty acre bean crop grown by
Gus Dunn, which totaled 82,400 pounds.
So far as we have heard Mr. Dunn
holds the record for a sinU) acre, hav
ing threshed 1600 pounds from a meas
ured acre. His late beans did not do
so well, so the total average was cut
d jwn somewhat. But even at that he
fjad over a thousand pounds per acre
which is some beans,

PERFECT IN ATTENDANCE
Interest of Board in Schools
Continues
Of a total enrollment of 106 during
the first month, Mountainair had 60
who were neither tardy nor absent.
This is remarkable when we compare it
with other schools in the state. This
report is very gratifying but is not the
high mark that will be set by the pu
pils of the public schools this year.
Watch the "Honor Roll"
Anyone who remembers the rain on
Friday of last week and can realize
that 88 pupils were in attendance on
that day, coming from homes within a
radius of five miles may be assured that
the pupils of Mountainair district are
interested in their work and feel that
when they miss a day of school they
have missed something and that it is
lost forever.
A new physiology cabinet and an 18
inch globe have been installed in Mrs.
Veal's room. The globe is suspended
from the ceiling balanced by an iron
weight and can be conveniently raised
and lowered as desired. These are val
uable additions to the equipment and
and are very attractive in appearance.
The Board of Education consisting of
Pesident W. R. Orme, Secretary Mrs.
G. V. Hanlon, and Judge M. B. Fuller
held their first meeting in the direr-tors
room in the new High School building
yesterday afternoon,
On account of the inclemency of the
weather last week the High school girls
postponed their "pie social" until Sat
udaynightOet 21 and would be glad
for a large attendance and an abun
dance of pies.
The Hiuh School is busy with iheir
first examinations and are anxiously !
1 joking forward to their first reports of
the year. Cards will be out on Mon
day.
The "era of good feeling" so preval
ent during the early weeks of school,
s till continues and we believe it will
continue throughout the year.
We are ending our sixth week with a
total enrollment of 112 and we bei eve
that we can boast of the largest schoof
in the county to date.
Do the teachers pupils and patrons
appreciate their Board of Education?
One less Burro
On Monday afternoon, a Rocky Moun
tain Canary disputed the right to the
right of way of the Santa Fe at the
local depot with the west bound pas
senger train, much to the damage of
the said Canary. The section crew was
busy some time following the departure
of the train, gathering up the frag
rnents and making interment therejf,
of what was at one time, an ordinary
burro.

five Hundred More Children
of Schoof Age than a
Year ago
COUNTY SCHOOLS MAKE
RAPID PROGRESS
Under the Efficient Swperinten
dency of Charles L.
Bart
R. F. Asplund, for years connected
with the State Superintendent's office
as chief clerk, and now with the New
Mexico laxpayers Association, was
here the first of the week, spending a
day with County Superintendent Burt
in checking over the levies to be made
for school purposes. Mr. Asplund un
derstands the new school law perhaps
better than any other person and is ex
plaining the law and its application to
the various county superintendents.
Among other things, Mr. Asplund
was surprised to find from Mr. Burt's
records that there are five hundred
more children in Torrance county of
school age, than there were a year ago.
Using the average as taken by the
state office, this represents an increase
in population of the county of 1,750.
He spoke most flatteringly of the rec
ords of the county superintendent and
the progress the schools have made un
der Mr. Burt's supervision.
The Mountainair school huilding came
in for high praue by Mr. Asplnnd, who
said the people who will build such a
structure are the kind who build empi
res; they show they have the stuff in
them, and will win out. He urged
Mountainair people to advertise their
building and school facilities, aB these
will bring in the right kind of peoplt.
Real home builders want the best of
school advantages.
lir. Asplund went from here t Car
rizozo, where he will assist the Lincoln
county superintendent.
