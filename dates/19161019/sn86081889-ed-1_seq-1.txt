ber 15, 1837, and with his parents
came to Buck Valley in 1818.
His grandfather Lee owned 25,
OCO acres of land in the Valley,
and at death gave the Doctor's
mother 8, 000 acres. This togeth
er with the Doctor's father's prop
erly, made the McKibbins large
landholders.
When the Civil War broke out
he became a member of Co. A.
130th regiment P. V. He after
ward belonged to Co. E. 149th
P. V. serving with distinction in
the defense of his country.

Dr. W. k McKibbin graduated
ii medicine from the University
)f Pennsylvania in 18G9 he spent
tactically the remainder of his
ife in the alleviation of the ills
iat befell the families living
ffithin the limits of a large circle
)f which his home was the cen
xr. Few men enjoyed the love
ind Bincere veneration of his
neighbors to a greater degree
Aan Dr. McKibbin, as was evi
lenced by the unusually large
wmber of people who attended
ais funeral.
A few years ago he retired
from active practice, purchased
the Fulton Republican and mov
ed to McConnellsburg. While he
Pressed refined literary tastes
nd could yield a facile pen, he
yearned to return to his old home
in the Valley and spend the re
mainder of his days among his
old neighbors.
The circumstances attending
his death were peculiarly sad.
He had in the yard at his home
tree of fine peaf s. Taking a
ladder he proceeded to pick the
fruit. When on the ladder about
fifteen feet from the ground, he
suffered an attack of vertigo,
'ell, and sustained such injuries
that death resulted in a short
time.
His funeral services were in
'harge of Odd Fellows of McCon
nellsburg and Warfordsburg Lod
ges, in the B. V. M. E. church.
The sermon was preached by
Kev. John Bennett, of the Breth
ren church, and his remains were
laid to rest in the cemetery at
toe church.

ly known, as Grandma Cunning

property nearby, does her own
work, and mingles in the little
social activities of the village
without any evidence of the
weight of years resting upon her.

Mrs. Campbell conceived the idea

The Farmer and Mr. Focht. r
From Valley Spirit.
The present Congress has per
haps enacted more constructive
legislation for the farmer than
any of its predecessors. In or
der that the farmers of the Sev
enteenth District may be inform
ed of the votes of Mr. Focht on
legislation urged in their behalf
by the Granges and kindred ru
ral associations, his record on
such legislation is here set forth
to be read and known of all men,
but especially by those who till
the soil. His negative vote, or
his failure to vote at all, shows
how vital is his interest in the
farmer's welfare. Here is the
amazing record.
Did not vote on passage of
Good Roads Bill;
Did not vote on Warehouse
Amendment to Agricultural Ap
propriation Bill;
Did not vote on Rural Credits
Bill.
It is clear that Mr. Focht has
not voted for these measures de
manded by you, Mr. Farmer.
Why not have a day of reckon
ing on November 7th arid send to
Congress as his successor Geo. A.
Harris, who will favor and vote
for remedial and desirable legis
lation for the protection and ad
vantage of the great farming
constituency of the 'shoe-string'
district.
The following from the St.
Louis Republic shows the feeling
of the farmers of the we3t con
cerning this program of legisla
tion which Mr. Focht did not
support;
For the first time in American
history the farmer has had his
day before Congress. Despite
the press of foreign affairs,
threatened international compli
cations, national preparedness
measures and the narrowly avert
ed industrial warfare between
railroads and railroad employes.
Congress has found time since
March 4, 1913, to do more for
the American farmer than had
been done during the preceding
half century.
The new Farm Loan act signed
by President Wilson in July and
the good roads legislation passed
by the recently adjourned Cong
ress overshadow other agricultur
al measures that were enacted
and may cause the voter to lose
sight of acts that are more of vital
importance to the farmer. Meas
ures that have been talked about
for years, that have been "mull
ed over" in committee rooms and
finally ignored or forgotten for
many sessions, have finally been
completed. For the first time in
American history a comprehen
sive rural credit law was enacted
and a long step taken toward the
betterment of national highways.
The list of rural legislation en
acted is a long one and includes
a Grain Standard act that will
bring about uniformity in grad
ing and selling grain, make it a
better security for loans and help
the man who grows the grain to
get a fairer price for his product.
Interlocking with this there is a
United States Warehouse act that
empowers the establishment of
licensed and bonded warehouses
for the storage of staple crops.
This means better storage and
the issuance of storage receipts
that will be easily turned into
cash.
One of the big problems at
tacked by the Administration
was that of better farm market
ing facilities. For the first time
systematic provision has been
made for a solution of the diffi
culties in distribution, marketing
rural finance and rural organiza
tion. There are lesser items in
this legislation, including the set
ting aside of $175,000 for the de
velopment of American potash
sources mid a sum for the aid of
the beet sugar industry.
From the viewpoint of the man
in the fields the last Congress,
like its predecessor, was an amaz
ingly busy and a strikingly effi
cient one. Adv..
Snbachbe tor the News.
Patriot or Poltroon.
President Wilson, addressing a
large delegation at Shadow Lawn,
made the following observation
and comment upon the American
ism of such representatives in
Congress as Benj. K. Focht.
"Only upon one conspicuous
occasion did the contrary happen,
when the Republican machine
was able to compel a majority of
its members in the House of Rep
resentatives to vote that Ameri
can citizens had no right to trav
ol on the high seas. If their
leaders believe in the rights of
American citizens, why don't
their followers? If their leaders
are so stiff to see that Americans
get their rights everywhere, why
do these men vote that Ameri
cans shall get their rights no
where? One of the most regret
table incidents cf American his
tory is, that there should have
been found men in the Congress
of the United States willing to
vote in that sense."
Does it not bring the blush of
shame to the red blooded Ameri
cans to have such a scathing, but
none the less righteous, rebuke
administered to one who purports
to represent this district in the
American Congress? What mat
ters it how boastful Mr. Focht is
about his devotion to patriotism?
We connot hear what he says be
cause of what he does. Surely
his deeds make his words of no
account. When the acid test was
applied to his Americanism, he
followed the lead of reactionary
and partisan Chieftains like Can
non and Mann and the Belshazzar
verdict must record the outraged
feeling of the entire Seventeneth
District constituency.
This people has always refl ec
ted the national spirit of America
and it is painful to contemplate
the p o 1 troonery of Mr. Focht in
that grave crisis when the Pres
ident a p p e a led to Congress to
speak America's sentiment to the
whole world. It is almost an af
front to come before the people of
this district who believe A meri
cans have- the right as neutrals to
travel unm o 1 e sted on the high
seas, and ask to be ret u r ned to
Congress by their suffrage. Is it
not high time to send to Congress
an American representative,
faithful to the desires and patriot
ic impulses of the people, and not
a truckler to a foreign power or a
partisan weakling? Mr. Focht'e
record should assure his defeat.
Let the people redress the wrong
by electing a typical representa
tive in George A. Harris. Adv.
No Club Heard From.
Two weeks ago, we offered a
book free of charge to the first
club of half-dozen people in the
County who applied for it. We
still have the book. We "can
come to but two conclusions
either reading is unpopular in the
County, or the readers are too in
dependent to receive valuable
books free. There is no string
to this offer. We are so sure
that we can aid our young friends
by pointing the way to the im
provement of their minds, and
at the same time affording pleas
ant entertainment this winter,
that we are willing to donate one
of the books necessary to the
club. This is all there is to our
proposition. Of course, any one
can read without being a club
member. But man is a social
creature, and there is nothing
like association with kindred spir
its to stimulate us and draw out
our best endeavors to improve
our minds, polish our manners,
and thereby increase our capaci
ty for doing good in this old
world.
Owing to advancing years Rev.
J. L. Grove has laid the matter
of his resignation before the ses
sions of his two congregations.
In case a resignation is agreed
upon, it will take place next
Bpring. In conversation with a
News reporter, Mr. Grove said
in substance that the great
we'ght of the pastor's responsi
bility might rest more efficiently
on younger shoulders.
