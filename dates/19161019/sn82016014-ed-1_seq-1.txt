The coldest -weather in more than
six months, with temperatures only a
few decrees above fre?zirg ami a cold
rain and snow driven by a fresh norft
wet wind, greeted Topeka today. Re
ports from other sections of Kansas
tell of snow and sleet and temperature
as low as twenty degrees in several
places. Temperatures were many de
grees below normal, and there is lit
tle chance for wanner weather in the
next few days, altho the rain will be

The forecast calls for partly cloudy
and colder weather in the eastern part
of the state with a hard freeze to
night. Friday fair. Temperatures will
beain climbing in the western par. of
Kansas Friday, but nothin of the

10 o'clock S5 2 o'clock 3d
The temperature at 2 o'clock this
afternoon was 32 degrees below the
reading at the same time Wednesday,
and is 3 2 degrees below normal. A
temperature of 32 degrees this after
noon makes this an official cold wave,
according to S. D. Flora, local weather
observer.
The wind is blowing at the rate of
thirty miles an hour from the north
west. The total fall of rain, snow and
sleet was f orty-hundredths of an
inch. This is the earliest date with
two exceptions in thirty years that
snow has fallen here.
Ueports to the local office of the
weather bureau indicate that the
storm covered the entire state. To
morrow will be a bright, cold day,
said Mr. Flora today.
From 67 degrees at 3 o'clock yes
terday afternoon the mercury drop
ped rapidly, and by 9:30 o'clock this
morning had reached 35 degrees. This
is a fall of 32 degrees in 30 hours. It
was considered probable this morning
that the mercury would reach the
freezing mark this afternoon, and cer
tain that the temperature would not
go above 40 degrees. The normal for
the afternoon is 65 degrees.
The rain started at 7:30 o'clock
this morning. Some sleet fell at 9:30
o'clock, and at 10 o'clock a flurry of
snow was mixed with the rain and
sleet. This is one of the earliest
dates on record here for sleet. A fall
of from 10 to 15 inches of snow is re
ported from Wyoming, and five inches
in Colorado, and temperatures were
below freezing yesterday in Wyoming.
The highest temperature on record
for this date (s 81 degrees, established
in 1S94. The low record, 27 degrees,
occurred in 1891. The moon tonight
rist's at 12:20 o'clock, hut the clouds
will prevent any moonlight.
From Over State.
Forces of old General Winter came
out of the trenches today and swept
east over Kansas from Colorado. Rail
road offices here today reported the
first snow In Kansas. The fall was
general over western Kansas and the
storm was rapidly moving east.
F.nrly this morning the Santa Fe
reported snow falling on its lines as
far east as Ellinwood with a cold,
drizzling rain between Topeka and
that place. Reports received in the
general offices here are to the effect
that there is five inches of snow in
Colorado.
The liock Island reported snow fall
ing in Herington. Belleville and on
west. In Herington the ground wa3
completely covered with a white shiet
nt N o'clock this morning. Snow was
also reported in Fort Riley and White
City. The Kansas snowfall is not so
heavy as that in Colorado but an in
crease is promised as the Colorado
storm is the one sweeping over west
ern Kansas, and unless the fall dimin
ish before it arrives the bulk has not
yet entered this stae. The reports,
pieced together, show the storm is
general over the western part of the
state, with rain preceding in its path.
The snow in western Kansas began
falling at some points as early as 1:30
o'clock this morning. In many places
It melted almost as fast as it fell but
in other places the temperature was
sufficiently low to let It remain on the
ground in a white, unbroken sheet.

tributing Companies.
HEARSN6 ON IN K. C, TOO
Gas Company Resumes Effort
to Enjoin Public.
Will Appeal to U. S. Court on
Independence Decision.
Independence, Kan., Oct. 19. All
supply contracts between the Kansas
Natural Gas company and Its distrib
uting companies in Kansas cities with
the exception of Leavenworth were
declared invalid in an opinion handed
down by Judge T. J. Flannelly In the
district court here today. The con
tracts are held to be "improvident,
wasteful, and destructive of the estate
of the Kansas Natural gas company
and should be disavowed."
The receiver for the company Is for
bidden to furnish gas under the form
er contracts. Certain rates, hereto
fore promulgated, are approved by the
court.
The opinion was given on questions
that came up last Monday, altho the
decision relating to the discharge of
the receiver and the adoption of an
reorganization plan, which also came
up Monday, were reserved for further
consideration.
The contract opinion which Is in line
with previous ones by state and fed
eral courts, is operative, of course,
only in Kansas but the receiver is in
structed to ask similar rulings from
the federal court for Missouri and Ok
lahoma points, "to the end that the
public may be served and the property
preserved."
None of the contracts declared In
valid have been adopted by the federal
or state receivers and the company
has been operating under a temporary
agreement.
Resume K. C. Hearing.
Kansas City, Oct. 19. Gas company
in a hearing before Judge Wilbur
Booth in the federal court In Kansas
City, Kan., today resumed its attempts
to enjoin the public utilities commis
sions of Missouri and Kansas and va
rious state and county officials from
interfering with the company's plan
for increasing gas rates.
Attorneys for both sides argued the
case and finally asked Judge Booth
to decide the point without reference
to the decision handed down today by
Judge Flannelly at Independence, de
claring invalid all supply contracts
between the gas company and various
Kansas distributing companies, ex
cepting that in Leavenworth.
Attorneys opposing the injunction
declared Judge Flannelly's order
would bo resisted and that it would
be taken to the supreme court.. The
hearing is continuing.
SHOCK KILLS 30
Soldiers in Blockhouse Dead as
Tio Sleeping.
Concussion of Big Shell Makes
Fort a Death Chamber.
With the French Armies Encircling
Chaulnes, Oct. 19. The most freakish
trick played by gunfire since the great
battle of the Somme began resulted in
the death of two German majors,
eight minor officers and twenty men
garrisoning a steel reinforced block
house in Bovent woods.
They were killed outright, by the
shock of one of the great French 400
millimeter shells, which struck nearby
but In no way damaged their fort.
This German blockhouse consisted
of eight observation chambers and a
machine gun tower. So strongly was
it built that it resisted, with compara
tively little damage, a terrific French
bombardment while its machine guns
kept spitting fire.
Find Dead Un wounded.
Finally French infantry were or
dered to take it by storming attack.
They went forward with a rush after
a brief bombardment, swarmed about
the blockhouse, .surprised by the Ger
mans lack of resistance and forced
their way in.
Inside they found the entire Ger
man garrison dead, unwounded and
apparently only sleeping. The shock
of the nearby explosion had been
transmitted to the interior of the fort.
It had been multiplied a thousand fold
but there were no outlets for the re
sulting vibrations except the peep
holes and machine gun slits.
The fort was large enough to hold
300 men.
DEFEAT RACE DIVISION
Episcopal Conference Rejects Project
to Establish Xegro Diocese.
St. Louis, Oct. 19. The joint com
mission on textbooks of English and
American history reported to the
house of deputies of the Episcopal
conference today that it had conferred
with authors of such textbooks, and
had achieved some success in its effort
to induce them to eliminate from their
books the statement that "the Church
of England, the parent of the Protest
ant Episcopal church, was founded by
Henry VIII." Ihe house of deputies
voted to increase the commission to
seven bishops, seven clergymen and
seven laymen.
A majority report, submitted by
the commission recommended an
amendment to the church constitution
providing that the house of bishops
may establish negro dioceses under
the supervision of negro bishops, while
the minority held that such a division
i "both unchristian and uncatholic."
It urged that the interests of the ne
groes can best be served by the reten
tion of the present provision of the
constitution permitting the election of
negro suffrangan bishops to assist
the white diocesan heads.
The house of deputies concurred in
adopting the minority report.

to the scenes of his "short grass"
range riding days.
While the colonel ostensibly is out
to make votes for Republican Candi

spend all his time playing politics
while in Arizona and New Mexico,
where he speaks Saturday and Mon
day. He is looking forward to meet

if the colonel keeps all the dates with
gun-fighting cowboys who knew him
in the old ranch days who have wired
him to be sure and visit them, this
trip won't end when it's expected to.
There are two men, however, who
have wired Roosevelt they will meet
him either at Phoenix or Albuquerque.
One is Seth Bullock, who used to sit
behind the colonel at political meet

hands, "to keep the audience atten

left ear "was bit off by a gentleman
in an argument.'

Roosevelt admittedly is glad to get

he did any western traveling. Then,

BOIL THEM DOWN
Episcopal Conference to Revise
Ten Commandments.
Modern Way Abbreviates An
cient Mosaic Law.
St. Louis. Oct. 19. The report of
tb.e- joint commission - on the revision
of commandments which recommends
the shortening of six of the Ten Com
mandments is yet to come before the
deputies of the triennial Protestant
Episcopal church conference for con
sideration. In its present position on
the calendar of the house it is likely
to come up for debate today. The re
port proposes the following changes
from the present commandments. If
the report is adopted, the command
ments will read:
1 No change from present.
2 Thou shalt not make unto thy
self any graven image nor the like
ness of anything that is in heaven
above or in the earth beneath or in
the water under the earth; thou shalt
not bow down to them nor worship
them.
3 Thou shalt not take the name of
the Lord thy God in vain.
4 Remember that thou keep holy
the Sabbath day.
5 Honor thy father and thy
mother.
6 No change from the present.
7 No change.
8 No change.
9 'Thou shalt not bear false wit
ness. ,
10 Thou shalt not covet anything
that is thy neighbor's.
The proposed form eliminates words
of explanation or argument for their
observance.
This is the part which it is proposed
to eliminate because they are used in
the Litany of the church, which forms
one of the most important parts of the
Protestant Episcopal prayerbook.
Revising Prayer Book.
Line by line, the 621 clergymen and
laymen composing the house of depu
ties of the general convention of the
Protestant Episcopal church are going
over their prayer books in an attempt
to revise and enrich it to meet de
mands for a greater freedom in the
service. Discussion of its enrichment
by the addition of new prayers was
on the calendar today, the fourth day
on which the house met as a commit
tee of the whole to consider the re
port of the commission on the prayer
book, submitted after three years of
study on the part of the members said
to represent several shades of ecclesi
astical and theological thought.
It is expected that recommendations
of the commission to correct mis
translations of Holy Scripture will be
discussed today. One proposal is to
change the word "damnation" in sev
eral collects to "condemnation."
To Simplify Service.
Another step toward the simplifica
tion of church service was taken when
appointment of a committee to draft
a simple manual of church service for
use in parishes in which there are
numbers of unlettered and foreign
born persons, was announced in the
house of deputies. The Rev. Iriving P.
Johnson of Faribault, Minn., was
chosen chairman.

"Wasson'g Report Shows City
Finances in Good Condition.
Will Close Tear With Good
Balance in Treasury.
Despite unusually heavy expendi
tures, the report of the city's finan
cial condition for the third quarter,
ending September 30, of this year,
shows the city treasury to be in an
excellent condition. Prospects that
the city will finish the year with sev
eral thousand dollars left in its cof
fers, after paying all bills, are good.
In fact, it Is almost certain. . The re
port was finished and sent to the State
Journal for official publication by W.
H. Wasson, finance commissioner, late
Wednesday afternoon.
The report shows the total cash in
all funds, general and special, on July
1, the beginning of the quarter, was
$310,261.37. During the quarter the
city received from the county treas
urer taxes amounting to $174,600.
From sale of bonds and similar
sources, the city received $212,886.35,
making a total of $697,747.72 upon
which the city could draw during the
quarter.
Disbursements for the quarter to
taled $398,344.09. leaving a balance
on October 1 of $299,403.63.
Disbursements for the quarter were
the largest for any one quarter this
year. This was caused by the fact
that several large bills which accu
mulated during other quarters came
due and were paid. Bridges and pav
ing and similar improvements formed
a large item in the increase.
"While the bills for the quarter to
taled large, the treasury is in excellent
shape," Commissioner Wasson said
today. "We expect to finish the year

JOKE ON E'LEPHANTS
After Draining Locomotive's Water
Tank They Had to Push Engine.
Galveston, Tex., Oct. 19. The cir
cus train was stalled by an empty
water tank. The engineer and -fireman
were vociferously mingling mu
tual accusations with profanity. Then
they saw a long, snaky object wriggle
over the rear of the tender and dart
down into the empty tank. The ob
ject proved to be an elephant's trunk.
Following this very tangible clue,
they discovered that three elephants,
who were occupying the car in the rear
of the tender, had lifted off the cover
of the tank and utilized the entire con
tents in elephantine shower baths.
As a punishment for this infraction
of railroad etiquette, the elephants
were compelled by a Hindu mahout
named O'Reilly to push the locomotive
three miles to the nearest source of
water supply.

Fairmont. W. Va.. Oct. 19. More
than 200 miners employed by the
Jamison company at Barrackville,
three miles from here -were entombed
early this afternoon by an explosion
of damp.
Accurate figures on the probable
death list are not available but early
reports say it would run high.
The explosion occurred at 1 oclock
in mine No. 7. The mine is a shaft
and until rescue parties can penetrate
the workings, the loss of life will not
be known.
300 Feet Vnderground.
Officials expressed the belief that
all who were inside had been killed
as the explosion seemed to have been
from coal dust and of great violence.
The shaft is 300 feet deep.
Superintendent Bierbower gathered
a party of volunteers together and en
tered the shaft in the hope of finding
some of the men alive, but at 2 o'clock
no word had been received from him.
R. H. Jamison of Pittsburg, general
manager of the company, was in Fair
mont when the explosion occurred and
at once went to the mine to take
charge of the rescue work.
ROBBERSJSCAPE
Kill Kansas Express Messenger
Who Showed Fight.
Probably Got Xothing Rumor
$10,000 Loot Unconfirmed.
Bliss, Okla., Oct. 19. Ranchmen
from several counties, reinforced by
numerous deputy sheriffs, waited at
daybreak today for some sign from
the ravine where it was believed the
six men who last, night robUrd Atchi son,
Topeka & Santa Fe express train
No. 405 andthen fled in automobiles,
had taken refuge.
Preparations for a siege l.ad been
made but it was hoped that the rob
bers would make a dash and precipi
tate a fight in which the sure-shooting
men of the range were confident none
of the outlaws would escape. Wheth
er or not the robbers are supplied
with stolen funds to assist in their
escape should they evade their pur
suers, will not be known until con
tents of the express and mail cars
ransacked by them have been checked
oflicially.
Shoot Messenger Iead.
Perry Norman, express messenger,
was killed by the robbers when he
showed signs of fight. The express
safe was demolished by an over
charge of explosive, so that much of
its contents was destroyed. Rumors
said the bandits obtained a loot of
$10,000, but this was based on con
jecture. "
Railroad men and sheriffs of long
experience in this territory said the
robbery was one of the boldest they
ever knew, and except for bungling
work in opening the express safe,
probably would have been ascribed to
old-timers. Six men participated in
the robbery, flagging the train at a
desolate spot north of RUss on the 101

military reservation here, but today to
make the burden worse for the men
who had become accustomed to the
hot suns of Texas and the Rio Grande,
snow began to fall, accompanied by a
high northwest wind.
"This weather is the first enemy
we've seen," said a "Top" sergeant
as he ordered out a detail to bring
In more fuel for the tent stove. De-
j spite the weather, which had started
out as rain, oecame sieei anu men
turned to snow, the troopers continued
at their camp work and the physical
examinations as a part of the federal
mustering out process started.

ing With FleeU ?
Rumor Collapses and Mob's
Hope Fades Away.

in complete control of the situation
here today, anti-allies mobs are be
ing dispersed and for the time being
the possibilities of a serious clash be
tween civilians and French marines
aeem to have been averted.

are continuing their attempts to or

Piraeus to intervene disheartened the
civilians and has helped restore order.
Newspaper extras were circulated
about the city by the anti-allies lead
ers, reporting that American warships
would arrive within a few hours to see
that Greek neutrality was not violated
by the allies. TheHe reports greatly
encouraged the mobs, thousands of
Greeks actually believing that they
would soon be Joined by American
marines.
"It is with Joy that we hear of the
approaching arrival of the great
American fleet," said one newspaper
circulated by the royalists. "It brings
relief in the midst .of our torments.
America resents the sorrows of the
Greek people and doubtless will pro
claim her reproof in a voice that will
resound across the sea."
The crowd that visited the Ameri
can legation to present an appeal for
American intervention learned that
these reports were ill founded and the
news spread quickly thruout Athens.

ment of French marines was landed
