MARION ODELL
REALLY MARRIED
Girl of 16 Tried to Elope
with Another Man
Last Year
A second romanee in the life of
Miss Marion P. Odell, the sixtern-year
o!d daughter of Mrs. May V. Odell, of
123 East l_lst Street, and a relativc of
forrner Governor Benjamin B. Odell, be?
came known last night when her mother
confirmed a report that the girl had
become thc wife of Donald C. Vreden
burgh in Tarrytown, on Monday.
Because of the unpleasant circum
stances of Miss Odell's attempted elope
ment a year ago with Joseph Beamisch,
a chauffeur, Mrs. Odell did not admit
at first her daughter had been mnrried.
"Marion was only a child when she
ran away to marry young Beamisch,"
l said Mrs. Odell, "and she has leamed
her lesson.
"Beamiflch ia still in prison at EI*
m'ra, where he was sent after he eloped
J with Marion, and while I consentc* to a
I year's probation of their love match
: I huve since decided, and so has my
daughter, that she could never marry
! him. Marion went away this afternoon
| and ia epending the evening with
1 friends. I expect her to return any
[minute. When she ccmes I shall have
!a talk with her and maybe"
Mrs. Odell's remarks were cut short
j as a young couple opened the front
I gate of the Odell home and rushed up
| the steps.
"Here is tone one to aee yon, dear,"
I said Mrs. Odell.
"Who i? it?" asked Marion, as she
j tried to identify the strangfr in thc
' dimly light'd vestibule.
"It's a reporter."
"Oh, no! I don't want to talk to
him." said Mnrion, and went into the
house.
Mr. Vredenburgh. a benedict of some
! two days. put a rrotecting arm about
i his \our.g wife, and they went into the
hou?e.
"GranoVpa and the others are inside
j waiting for you, dear," said Mra. Odflli
I aa the young couple vanished within.
"I shall now interview my daughter,"
1 continued Mrs. Odel!, "and maybe after
i 11 o'clock I thall be able to tell you
j Bomething."
Tnw 10 her word, ahe announced
that her daughter had become the wife
? of Mr. Vredenbargk at Tarrytown on
Monday, tbe eoromony being performed
by Judge Moorehouse.
"This ia no runaway match,' ahe
i said "Marion was married with our
j consent, and that is all that is to be
1 said We had planned to announce It
I through the regular channels. They
will go on a little wedding tr p and
will live in Yonkers, where Mr. Vreden?

LUSITANIA
NOTE SECRET
TUL ELECTION
Lansing Will Not Per

Be Vote Issue
GERMAN OFFER
NOT ACCEPTED
U. S. Will Give Britain No
Explanation on U-53
Unless Asked
[ From tha Trtbune Bnntui ]
Washington, Oct. 18.?Reluctant to
make a political issue of the final set?
tlement of the Lusitania case, the
.State Department has decided, it was
learned to-day, to postpone publication
of the "subatHt.tially satisfactory" Ger?
man memorandum of February 16 until
after election. (iermany's offer of set?
tlement has not been formally ac?
cepted, It was declared, and probably
no action will be taken on it until the
department is ready to make it public.
Count von Hernstorff's nienioraii.l'ini,
refu.ing an explicit disavowal bflcaoaa
the German government had already
officially recognized and defer.ded the
sinking of tho Lusitania, offered in?
stead to "recogni*e liability" for in?
demnity. This "form of words" ap?
peared to officials as Bubstantially
equlvnlent to a di?avowal. In admit
ting liability, it was believed, Germany
acknowledged the illegality of the act.
Too Serious for Polltics
The preser.t attitude of this govern?
ment was outlined to-day by a high
official of the Administration. I7e said
there was a desire in certain quarters
to drag the German memorandum out
and make a political issue of it, but
that it was too fcrious to be dealt with
in that way. For this reason the Ad?
ministration prefera to postpone action
until after election, when the country
can judge lt on its merita.
Another ronsideraticn ls thnt the
amount of Indemnitj* which this gov?
ernment is to get from Germany has
not been definitely fixed. It is report?
ed on good authonty that $5,000 l'or
each of the 115 Americans lost on the
Lusitania is the amount tentatively
agreed on, a total of 1575,000. Added
to this will be like sums for Ameri?
cans lost on the Falaba, Arabic, Sus<ex
and other torpedoed vessels.
The settlement of the Ancona case
with Austrta is likewise hanging nre
and may be taken up after election.
The Austrian disavowal is considered
satlsfactory.
Count von UernstorfT'i memorandum
of Fei.niary IG was about tr. be accept?
ed formally and the Lusitania case
closed when the publication of (ier?
many's warning that armed merchant
men would be attacked without warn?
ing caused the State Department to
hesitate. It was declared that this new
attitude of Germany's had nulhtled or
at leaat nodifled the assurances that
"Iiners" WOUld not be attacked .llegally.
These aaaurancea were part of the Lu?
sitania settlement.
Believe (.ermany Slncere
Refore an agreement could be reached
on this point, the Sussex was torpedoed
and the Lusitania case immediately
dropped. After the new assurances
given by Germany in the Sussex case,
the State Department delayed settling
tho Lusitania affair until it was seen
whether Germany purposed to carry'
out the threat of renewed submarine
warfare lf Fr.gland was not brought to
terms.
Officials believe now that Germany's
sineenty has been demonstrated. Hut
for the impending election and the fear
of making the Lusitania settlement an
issue, the Administration would pro
ceed at once to conclusion of the mat?
ter, it is declared.
Thc I'nited States will not feel calied
upon ta> make publ'c any statement on
the raid of the U-U or the Kubmatine
situation in general, it was learned
nuthoritatively to-day, as a conse
(juer.ce ot' thc statement in Parliament
by Viscount Grey that his government
would not make any official represen

THE DESTROYERS AT JUTLAND
Hare you vcus of my boy Jack?
Not this tide.
When d'you think that hc'll come back?
Not with this wind blowing and this tide.
Has any one etee had trord of him?
Not this tide,
For what is sunk will hardly swim?
Not with this wind blowing and this tide.
Oh, dear! What comfort can I find?
None this tide?nor any tide.
Except he didn't shame his kind,
Not even with that wind blowing and that tide.
Then hold your head up all the more,
This tide and every tide,
Because he was the son you bore
And gave to that wind blowing and that tide.
There was much destroyer work in the battle of Jutland.
The aetual battle area may not have been more than 20,000
square miles, but the incidental patrois from first to last must;
have covered many times that area. Doubtless the next gen
eration will comb out every detail of it.
All we need to remember is that there were many squad
rons of battleships and cruisers engaged over the face of the
North Sea and that they were accompanied in their dread
comings and goings by multitudes of destroyers, who attacked
the enemy both by day and by night from the afternoon of May
31 to the morning of June 1, 1916.
We are too close to the gigantic canvas to take in the mean
ing of the pieture. Our children, stepping backward through
the ye-irs, may get our perspective and proportions.
To recapitulate what every one knows. The German fleet
came out of its North Sea ports, its scouting ships ahead, then
destroyers, cruisers and battle-eruisers and at laat the ma'n
battle fleet in the rear. It moved north on a course parallel
with the coa,st of Stolen Schleswig-Holstein and Jutland.
Fleets Already Out, Feeling for Enemy
Our fleets were already out. the main battle fleet, of j
Admiral Jellicoe, speeding down from the north, and our battle
cruiser fleet, under Admiral Beatty, feeling for the enemy. Our
