Effort of Democratic Sheet to Use an Old Primary Campaign
Charge about Weston State Hospital Employes Falls Flat
As It Was Immediately Repudiated at the Time.
STATEMENT OF DENIAL IS ISSUED BY MISS DAVIS
Proof is Given That Neither Male nor Female Employes of the
Institution Were Required to Make Assessments nor Were
They Denied Privilege of Supporting Any Candidate.
Floundering around in the mire of its own falsehoods about
employes of the Weston State Hospital having been compelled to
contribute part of their salaries for the Republican state cam
paign, the Clarksburg Exponent has resorted to quotations from
a primary campaign pamphlet called "The Election Bulletin,"
which was issued at Weston along about June 1 last.
The Exponent made one direct charge a day or tw< ago that
all the female employes of the hospital had been con.pelled to
contribute assessments to the Republican state campaign fund
under penalty of dismissal. Scarcely was the ink dried upon the
Exponent when every single one of the female employes of the
hospital signed a statement denying the charge in toto. Having
thus failed to get away with that campaign fib, the Exponent in
its issue of Thursday morning has tried to fasten the same mis
x-epresentation upon the male employes of the hospital.
The Exponent, however, very carefully failed to mention the
fact that this primary misstatement was exploded at the time it
was issued. For the benefit of those who might perchance be mis
led by the Exponent's desperate efforts to extricate itself from
the mire into which it has fallen, the following statement-signed
by every male employe of the hospital on June 2 last, immediately
after the issuance of "The Election Bulletin," is herewith repro
duced :
Weston State Hospital.
Weston, W. Va., June 2, 1916.
We, the undersigned employes of this institution, hereby
certify that we have not been required to pay money nor
have been assessed anything for Judge Robinson's campaign
for governor. Furthermore, no one has interfered with our
.?ight and privilege to support any candidate that we may
choose.

Still further efforts were made by the Exponent to cover up
its misrepresentations by trying to make it appear that Miss Rose
Davis, supervisor of the woman's department of the hospital,
had furnished the campaign fib for the Exponent. Here is what
Miss Davis has to say about that:
Weston, W. Va., Oct. 19, 1916.
Editors Telegram,
Clarksburg, W. Va.
Dear Sirs: Kindly permit me through your paper to
deny the statements accredited to me in today's Clarks
burg Exponent. While in the Bailey House yesterday, J. G.
Shaw introduced himself to me as a representative of the
Exponent and asked for an interview. I presumed he was
the author of the article which appeared in that paper a
few days ago and knowing that whatever statements I would
make would be distorted, in the efforts of his newspaper to
pull itself out of the hole into which its disregards for the
truth has put it, I refused to answer his questions.
However, Mr. Shaw makes one statement which is true.
He states that I was embarrassed. Any lady addressed in
the ungentlemanly manner that characterized his conversa
tion with me, I am sure would be embarassed.

NEW YORK, Oct. 3 9?Cairman
William R. Willcox, of the Republi
can national committee, shows con
clusively in a review of the situation
In this country that our present pros
perity Is due solely to the European
war and he gives striking figures to
prove his position. Chairman Will

the present prosperity is highly im

LOUISVILLE. Ky., Oct. 1!?.?Theo-'
dore Roosevelt flayed President Wfl-i
son for alleged broken promises here!
Wednesday night. He said the chief
executive's disregard of platform
pledges had become a subject for Jest
even among the president's friends.
He ridiculed Mr. Wilson's statement
in his Omaha speech that he was "will
ing to fight," but was "waiting for
something worth fighting for.'* and
asked what further incentive to "put
all the corpuscles of his blood into
shouting shape," as the president ex
pressed it, could be asked than the
Lusltanla sinking.
At the outset of my speech I wish to
point out, as I have elsewhere pointed
out, that the doctrine now often ad
vanced as to the impropriety of criti
cising the president, without any re
gard as to whether the criticism Is
or is not just, has no warrant either
in history or on grounds of public
morality. Andrew Jackson in a mes
sage to the Senate on April 15, 1834,
put the case exactly as it should be
put He said:
"The president is accountable
at the bar of public, opinion for
every act of his administration.
Subject only to the restraints of
truth and justice, the free people
of the United States have the un
doubted right, as individuals or
collectively, orally or in writing
at such times and in such lan
guage and form as they may think
proper, to discuss his olllclal con
duct and express and promulgate
their opinions concerning It."
This lays down the law that should
bo followed. There must be truth and
justice in all that iB said of the presi
dent or of anyone else; but less than
any oris other man in the nation has
he the right to claim immunity from
any criticism that is both just and
truthful. I criticise President Wilson
because his deeds have belied his
words, and his words have belied one
another.
All Promises Broken.
Mr. Wilson's promises before elec
tion, both those made in his own
speeches, and those made In the plat
form, have been so well-nigh invar
iably broken, that the breaking of |
them has become a subject for jest*

CHICAGO, Oct. 19.?The pub

increase in the price of bread
if wheat continues to advance,
according to predictions today
by leading bakers.
The ten cent jump in the pricc
of wheat in the last two days
sent flour up seventy-flve cents

bakers to announce that, in ad
dition to the recent increases
in the price of bread they would
have to make further advances
unless something unforseen
lowered the pricc of flour. Bak
ers paid $9.50 a barrel whole
sale for flour yesterday, the
highest price in Chicago in
twenty years.
even among his own friends. One of
Mr. Wilson's prominent Democratic
supporters in Congress stated with re
freshing frankness the exact truth
about Mr. Wilson's pre-election prom
ises, and those made on his behalf,
when in answer to some charge of
inconsistency, he responded by say
ing that "our platform was made to
get into office on?and we have won."
You will find this remark on page
4618 of the Congressional Record, the
third session of the sixty-second Con
gress. It is impossible to study Mr.
Wilson's pre-election promises and
post-election performances; it is im
possible to compare the diametrically
opposed attitudes he has assumed at
different times on almost every public
question; it is impossible to compare
what he says in one set of speeches

without feeling that this congression

COUSIN, NOT GIRL,
SLAYER OF FATHER
And the Dead Man's Wife is
Implicated According to the
Girl's Second Confession.
Resulting from a second confes
sion made by Lena Bonaflglio, a thir
teen-year-old school girl, who is a
prisoner in the county Jail charged
with murdering her father. Frank
Bonaflglio, while he slept early Wed
nesday morning, the county officials
are busily engaged today searching
Tor Joseph Tutera, a cousin of the
girl who, she alleges, killed her fath
er.
The girl told a story Wednesday
morning that she had killed her fath
er because he had made Improper ad
vances to her and she continued tell
ing this story to all who visited her
until late Wednesday afternoon when
a local Italian visited her and told
her that the officers know all about
the case and that her cousin would
be arrested in a few hours. It was
then that she repudiated her confes
sion and told the story of how she,
her mother and her cousin plotted to
kill her father and successfully car
ried out the plot.
Says Mother Planned, Too.
Her second story was to the effect
that Tuesday her cousin, her mother
and herself planned that at the sup
per table that evening that her cousin
should announce that he had to go
to Phoenl* to deliver some papers
he had received a few days before
from the old country. Following the
evening meal, Tutera left for Phoe
nl*. He returned to the Bonaflglio
home sometime that night between
12 and 1 o'clock and was admitted
war is over. Look at these figures.
In 19H, this country exported $14,

chinery. In 1916 It exported J61,
300,000 worth. In 1914 we exported
J1S2.700.000 worth. What better
proof could there be of Europe's
determination to be Industrially pre

Thursday morning that she would
never have changed her first state
ment if she had not been fooled by
the Italian who told her that the offi
cers knew about it.
Hays Joe Was There.
Palma Bonafiglio when Interviewed
Thursday morning did not know that
her daughter' had made a second
confession and told a story very simi
lar to her daughter's confession of
Wednesday morning, but when told
that her daughter had told the truth
about the affair she then admitted
that Tutera had been at the house
at the time stated awe but she
would not admit he killed her hus
band. All she would say was that it
was for the honor of her daughter.
Mrs. Bonafiglio said that Lena and
her cousin had been like brother and
sister and that her cousin had been
very angry at his uncle for treating
his daughter the way he had. She
also stated that I^ena had threatened
to take a revolver with her on some
of the walks her father took her. and
when he tried to bother her kill him.
To this plan Mrs. Bonafiglio objected
as she was afraid that If the girl
failed In her attempt to kill her
father, he would have killed both
her and her daughter.
Both Mrs. Bonafiglio and the girl
say they do not know where Tutera
went .following his visit to their home
but they think he went back to Phoe
nix so his alibi would be corap-sto.
In that he could prove that he had
been at Phoenix Tuesday evening and
was also there Wednesday morning,
so that the officers could not con
nect him with the crime.

Charles E. Hughes against
Unwarranted Attack.

Packed to Doors When Sec
retary of State Speaks.
BRIDGEPORT, Oct. 10?United
States Senator William E. Chilton's
unwarranted attack on Charles E.
Hughes Tor his decision in the Vir
ginia debt case was fully answered
here Wednesday night by Secretary
of State Stuart F. Hoed. Republican
nominee for Congress in the Third
district, who addressed a cheering
crowd that packed the spacious FIU
hugli hall to overflowing.
First. Opinion by Democrat,
Mr. Heed pointed out that the
opinion, which held that the su
preme court had Jurisdiction in the
ease, was rendered by Chief Justice
Fuller, a southern Democrat, and
following that the first opinion in the
case, which was entirely favorable to
the state of Virginia, was rendered
before Mr. Hughes became a member
of the court.
The only decision rendered by the
supreme court in the case since 1010,
when Mr. Hughes became a member
of that tribunal, was the one which
allowed West Virginia credits to the
amount of $3,000,000, which, with
interest, would total approximately
$10,000,000. Senator Chilton has
been kicking up a big fuss over the
fact that Justice Hughes "wrote the
opinion." Even had the opinion
been unfavorable to West Virginia,
which it was not. Justice Hughes
merely expressed tho unanimous
| opinion of the court in writing the
decision, Mr. Reed said. He was
merely designated to write the opin
ion. In every caso one justice Is
elected to write the opinion, the
speaker declared.

The crowd that heard and ap
