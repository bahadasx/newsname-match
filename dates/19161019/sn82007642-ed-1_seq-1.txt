bravely by .his record. Senator

both dynamiting Hughes for his

Hughes was evidently correct
when be said he was 100 percent
a candidate." His talk of Wilson
turning Republicans out of office
and putting in Democrats is en
tirely unworthy of a presidential
candidate. Of course Hughes
knows, as everybody else knows,
that all parties in power has
done tnj8i. Senator Vance, of

administration, and which forces

hope of repealing the income tax,
.Hughes regards as "a straight
flush" in his political game. If
elected he would win all the stakes
on the table, for the rich would
no longer pay, and they and

know why? The answer is simple:
he knows the peoph are for it, he
knows his monied masters are a-

their wrath.
No man can read his speeches
and tell what he stands for, ex
cept that he stands for the mon
ey kiugs of America, and against
the interest of the "toiling mass
es." He was, when Governor of
New York, allied with the big
monied interests and corpora
tions and against the welfare of
the people, and if elected presi
dent, he will be the Biibservient
tool of the same crowd.
The people of the South are
as loyal to the flag and to the
union as are the people of all oth
er sections of our common coun
try. Notwithstanding the f a c t
that the plow-shares of war seam
ed our hillsides and valleys with
terrible scars, that every South
ern home was a sacrificial altar,
and the lintels of the door posts
of nearly every Southern hamlet
were sprinkled with the blood of
our first born, we thank God that
those scars have long since healed
on all our hills and valleys, and
in all our hearts and homes, and
that tlie men of the North and
the South and their children are
living together in the bonds of
peace and brotherly love. The
men of the South, as deeply and
tenderly as the men of the North
appreciate the patriotic senti
ment of those who wore the Blue
and the Gray:
"Each did the duty that be law;
bacn wrought at Uod's supreme de
sigu:
And under love's eternal law
Lach life with equal beauty shines,"
And yet in the face of these
blessed truths Hughes is attemp
ting to stir among the dead em
bers and arouse a spirit of sec
tionalism by crying to his aui-
ence, "The South is in the sad
die." This vicious spirit alone
should turn thousands of Repub-
icans North and South against
him. Any man who attempts to
stir up bitternes between the dif
ferent sections of his country
is unworthy of public confidence.
When we think of the great Re
publican party the party that
enriched and glorified the annals
of our history the party great
est in initiative and achievement
the party of Lincoln, Grant,
Harrison, McKinley, Roosevelt
Taft, Blaine, Conkling, and a
great host of immortals and
then think of the shifty dodger
Hughes as its candidate, we real
ly feel that, for a season at least,
' the 'scepter has departed from
Judah."
When the people know the
people know the facts, and they
will know them, being more en
lightened and independent of par
ty dictation than ever before,
they will flock to the standard of
the man who by his great diplo
macy and wisdom has kept our
uation out of war, has been large
ly instrumental in the passage of
laws which have brought nation
al prosperity, widespread appro
val, and the assurance of a more
glorious future. He is no veiled
prophet; Hughes is hothingelse.
He never acts tne part. Hughes
had doim little else, since the
presidential bee months
stung him as he sat in the chair
of an Associate Justice in the Su
premejeourt. Wilson is frank,
open, candid; Hughes is neither,
but with the studied art of the
Demagogue he wraps authority
and power in mystery in order
to magnify them. Pretending
that he did not want the nomi
nation, recent events prove that
he was a most "willin' Barkis'
and this too in the face of the
fact that months agchewentbe
fore a notary public and regis
tered an oath that under no con
dition would he accept the nom
ination. What has become of this
oath?

Attacking the Democratic Verdon.
In this campaign the Republi
cans are concentrating their lire
on the Public School record of
the past sixteeti years. This is the
record to .which Charles B. Ay
cock gave his very soul, and
while the recital of its glories
was burning on his lips, he "walk
ed with Uod and was not." If
this record does notclothe North
Carolina in immortal honor, the
life of Charles B. Aycock was a
tragic failure, and his activities
were a fraud union the people of
the State.
Of necessity large su m suf mon
ey have been spent in the making
of this record, but none has been
mis-spent. Giowth is notextrav

Morgauton, Oct. 3
P. S. Of course ii pains me to
be out of harmony with many
warm political friends of .this
Presidential issue, but I am deep
ly persuaded that the peace of
our country depends on the de-
feat of Hughes. Many of my
friends may think roe lacking in
judgement, but will, I know, give
me credit for sincerity. There
are some whose party loyalty is
so based on the hope of a govern
ment job, that I shall accept and
welcome their criticism.
High Prices i Blessinf.
Charlotte News,
The statement appeared a few
days ago in an exchange that
the present tremendous high
price for the staple commodities
may be a blessing disguised for
the American people in that they
would be driven back to a more
economical process of living.
That is, indeed, a legitimate spec
ulation. There is no question a
bout the fact that the average
household in this country is too
extravagant. Prodigality does
not alone exist with the well-to-do
but even in those fanilies
where there is something of a
struggle for a livelihood, things
are thrown away that our fore
bears would have been delight
ed to possess. The little essen
tials are disregarded. An im
proper value is attached to them.
What were once luxuries are be
coming the things that we refuse
to get along without. Our tastes
are exorbitant in their demands.
The pace we are setting is too
swift. If the high prices at pres
ent prevading for the bodily es
sentials, for the food that we are
putting iu our mouths, has the
ultimate effect of forcing us to
assize the essentials more rigidly,
they will, indeed, haye become a
blessing to the American people.
There is yet another aspect,
however, of this question which
permits us to interpret present,
prices, and notably is this true
in the south couutry. Extrava
gantly Jhigh prices for food and
feedstufi's will undoubtedly drive
our producing forces to a more
economical species of farming.
Diversification is a gospel that
needs yet to be preached in this
southern land. Within the past
few years we have been getting
over to its side, but with nothing
ike the avidity thatshould have
been practiced. There is yet too
great a tendency to raise whole
plantation of cotton and then
buy the corn the stock eat in the
west and get our own meats from
the same source of supply. Far
mers of North Carolina have no
business asking any other see
tion of the tinted States to put
a particle of food in their own
mouths or feedstuns into the
mouths of their cattle and stock
North Carolina soil will grow ev
ery bit of it. North Carolina cli
mate will permit the growing of
it 'all. And North Carolina ge
nus and thrift and enterprise
when properly directed can match
its powers with any on the top
side of the globe. All that is nee
ded is for the farmers once to get
on the right track and then the
problem will begin to solve itself.
