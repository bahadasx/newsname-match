"A Conglomeration
Whites, Half-breeds
And Indians."
In a political speech at Minne
apolis recently in advocating the
election of Judge Hughes, ex
Sena or 3everidge of Indiana seated
that Mexico had no" government
that should be recognized, and tbit
it was a countrj' composed of a
conglomeration of whites, half
breeds and Indians that the popu
lation was composed of two million
whites, two million and a half of
half-breeds and fifteen millions'of
Indians that'there were sixty-five
tribes that had as nriny rulers.
The senator asked the audience if
they considered that a govern
ment, and when asked by a mem
ber of the audience if he would
have recognized Mexico as a gov
ernment if he. was in President
Wilsoufa placo.he knaofdiatcly re
plied he would have done so.
Senator Beveridge's argument
was inconsistent, but aside from
that who is responsible for the
Mexican troubles. If any reliance
can be placed upon general re
ports "Wall Street interests have
had more influence toward keep
ing up the Mexican troubles than
all other reasons combined. Ameri
cans supported by Wall Street
have invested largely in Mexico,
and Diaz granted large concessions
to which Mexicans were opposed
and this was the primary cause
for the Mexican revolution.
If the Mexican nation is com
posed largely of Indians, it cer
tainly, has a mo&t dismal future be
fore iMfor the greed of white
Americans will cause the same
conditions to exist among the In
dians of Mexico as have existed
among the American Indians for
over a century.
For The Indians It Will
Make No Difference.
Whether President Wilson is re
elected, or whether Justice Hughes
is clec'ed president, it will prob
ably not make much difference to
the Indians of the country, for the
policies now in force and which
will remain in force as long as the
civil service law is in existance
will not be changed.
Over the Taftadministration the
Wilson administration has made
many great improvements, but
over the Roosevelt administration
none. So far as encouraging the
Indians and giving them assistance
by appointing them to government
positions in the Indian service the
Roosevelt administration l^d e^ery
administration in the history of
the country.
If President Wilson is re elected
improvements in the Indian service
might continue to improve slowly,
and alt'iouiih Mr. Hughes is
strongly in favor of maintaining
the civil service force conditions
might improve under him with
men friendly to Indians in Con
gress.
Failure Of Indians ToGet
Positions Continues,
The continued failures of mem
bers of the Chippewa bands of
Minnesota to obtain positions in
the Chippewa Indian service con
unbrokenly.
The at'ticles which have appeared
in THE TOMAHAWK relative to the
efforts of Chippewas to secure
positions in the Chippewa Indian
service have not only received
local attention, but have attracted
the attention of Iudians of other
bands, and al*o of some public
men as indicated in several letters
we have received upon the sub
ject.
We have not been authorized to
publish any of thee letters which
contain some very forciful state
meuts, we therefore treat them as
privileged, confidential communi
cations. But as oae of our corres
pondents is a Chippewa of the Red
Like reservation who now resides
in Kiusas, and has authorized us
to publish her letter, we take
pleasure in doing so, and it is as
follows:
"I have read the articles which
have appeared in TU TOMAHAWK
regarding (he positions in the
Chippewa Jndiau service, and I
thought 1 would write and tell you
how I tried for five years to get a
position in the Chippewa Indian
service in Minnesota, and which
was upon my own reservation,
namely the Red 'Lake Reserva
tion.AvA one-time was told by
the superintendent that he wanted
a man and bis wife as principle
teacher and head matron. Within
a few da3Ts
he got a matron who
was not married, nor has he ever
had a married man and his wife
for these particular positions.
I have been the head matron in
one of the schools of the Five
Civilized Tribes, and those schools
are far ahead of the Red Lake
schools, and much larger.
I always had not less than fifty
girls at the school where I was
employed as matron, while Red
Lake has comparatively a few. I
am sure I could have held a posi
tion in a small school like Red
Like to advantage because of my
experience in the school referred
to.
Of course now I do not care
about a position in the service as
I 'would not ^o without my hus
band, who holds a position better
than any school could pay him.
If you wish to use this letter
you may do so, and I certainly
hope THE TOMAHAWK will succeed
in getting the places for the many
Chippewa boys and girls who are
entitled to them and should have
thorn."
Our correspondent is Mrs.
Curtis Smith, who is a sister of
Charles Dclson of Red Lake.
The experience of Mrs. Smith
is not an unusual one but has re
cently become very common upon
this/eserration at least. Young
men competent to fill the positions
in the Chippewa Indian service in
this state are ignored entirely, and
Dersons who are not members of
the tribe are given the preference
over the Indian boys.
Charles Wilkinson, who is not
in the classified service, continues
to draw a good, substantial salary
from tribal funds although there
are a sc of In iian boys who are
his superior by education and
otherwise who could fill the posi
tion he holds. Nor this is not the
only iositio which the boys of
this reservation could fill if they
were given the chance for tbey
could fill every position in the ser
vice.
It is not surprising that the
young men of the tribe severely
criticise the present Indian admin
istralion when they compare the
local office force of the present
time with that during the Roose
velt administration and when
Simon Michelet had members of
the reservation only as his office
force.
If those who are seeking posi
tions in the Chippewa Indian ser
vice who are members of the Chip
pewa tribe would proceed- unitedly
and systematically to bring mat
ters to the attention of those
higher than the Indian office at
Washington, there is no doubt
they would be successful. There
is one trouble which should not be
lost sight of and it is that some
applicants are selfishly inclined
and while they may pretend to be
working for the common cause,
they will bear watching. The way
to proceed to obtain positions is to
secure the co-operation of the
president of the Chippewa General
Council and the Executive Com
mittee of the Council.
Who Will Go To Wash
ington?
There is much to be done yet at
Washington regarding the tribal
affairs of the Chippewas of Minne
sota. The good results of the
work of the delegations that went
to Washington during the past
two years leads us to suggest that
the Chippewas should again send
delegations to Washington next
winter to try and finish, if possi
ble, the work that has been com
menced oy them.
One of the great drawbacks to
sending delegations to Washington
is the matter of advancing funds
for the trips, for each delegate has
to advance his own expenses with
a very doubtful chance of being
able to secure remuneration. In
fact, whenever a delegate goes to
Washington to attend to tribal
business he not only has to pay his
own expenses, but frequently has
to wait a year oi perhaps more to
have the amount he paid out re
funded to him. This has caused
many delegates who have been ap
pointed to go to Washington to
decline to do so.
So far as can be learned no one
here has indicated that he woulc",
if appointed as a delegate to Wash
ington, advance his own funds to
pay the expenses of a trip there on
tribal business. Those who have
heretofore done so, or at least
some of them, have positively de
cided to not accept any appoint
ment as delegates.
But this should not deter the
tribe from sending others down
who may be willing to advance
their expenses, and it should do
so, for this is a most crucial time
when Chippewa interests should
receive the attention of the Chip
pewas.

Reservation Game Should
Be Protected.
Several yours ago and before the
passage of the Clapp Act, this res
ervation was the breeding place of
all kinds of game, but since the
reservation has become settled^ by
whites it has ceased to be a breed
ing place for any kind of game,
not even prairie chickens.
So far as prairie chickens are
concerned they are very rapidly
becoming exterminated and unless
laws are passed to protect them
entirely for several years thej
will become entirely extinct like
the wild pigeons of years ago.
An appeal should be made to
Congress to pass a law which will
prohibit the hunting of prairie
chickens upon Indian reservations
for several years at least, and like
wise to enforce the existing law
which prohibits any person except
an Indian from hunting upon an
Indian reservation.
Men whose rights to reside up
on this reservation were obtained
simply by purchase have assumed
that they got all the rights to the
reservation that the Indians have,
including the right to hunt and in
vite their eastern friends to come
here and hunt.
Under an existing law of the
United States the fire arms, con
veyances and other acoutrements
of hunters upon Indian reserva
tions may be seized and sold by
an Indian agent unless the person
or person's have the ""written con
sent of the Commissioner of In
dian Affairs allowing them to hunt
rm
upon the reservation. This law
since Agent Michelet was here has
been ignored entirely.
It is becoming dangerous for
anyone to go into the wood of
this reservation during the open
season for deer hunting on account
of the number of white hunters
who shoot wild. Reside* this dan
ger the wild game is being driven
from the reservation and this
should be stopped.
