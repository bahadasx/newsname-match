City Drug Store
SaysVictrolals
Its Best Seller
The City Drug store reports a big in
quiry for the Victrola, with a goodly
number of sales completed. Mr. Mc
Gillivray some time ago told the
Times-Record that if the crop this
year had been equal to last year his
sales would probably made a record
for cities of this size. The Times-Rec
ord is of course glad to get such con
firmation of the value of advertising
in its columns, but realizes that the
personality of Mr. McGillivray and his
assistant, E. M. Harding, has a great
deal to do with their good business in
all lines. The City Drug store is a
good store to do business with, as cus
tomers are sure of good value for their
money, coupled with courteous treat
ment that makes trading there a pleas
ure. The increase of their business in
the last few years prove the truth of
this statement.

Valley City high school won from
Casselton In one of the hardest-fought
games that has been played on the lo
cal gridiron this season by a score of
10 to 0. For the first three quarters
of the game the ball was pushed back
and forth across the field, each team
being forced to punt time and again.
At this stage of the game Casselton
showed more pep and fight and kept
the ball in Valley's territory most of
the time. Casselton, with their heavy
backfield, at times were able to make
considerable gains through the line. In
the last quarter the local boys releas
ed some of the pep that they had
seemingly held in reserve. As a result
the only touchdown of the game was
scored, when Weston broke away for
a 30 yard run, which put the ball over
for a count of seven.
It was then that Valley high began
their real playing. They pushed the
ball to Casselton's 25 yard line, where
with a perfect place kick, Weston sent
the ball over the bar for an additional
three points.
Aside from the run which scored the
lone touchdown, there was really noth
ing of a spectacular nature. L. Stens
hoel, at left end for the locals, was
probably the most consistent player
on the field. T. Cook broke through
the opponents' line on several occas
ions for good tackles. Gunderson and
Martin played their usual dependable
games at tackles. The usual aggres
sive play of the local aggregation was
decidedly lacking in the first three
quarters of Saturday's game, or the
score would have been decidedly dif
ferent.
The next game on the local field will
be played Saturday with Enderlin high
school.
Tax Commission Due
for Change Next May
Eismarck, Oct. 17.—No general lop
ping of heads will follow the inaugur
ation of North Dakota's next gover
nor. One of Lynn J. Frazier's closest
friends, who is in frequent conference
with the Republican state standard
bearer, is of the opinion that only in
efficiency or particularly grave cases
of "pernicious political activity" will
be considered cause for dismissal. "At
least one good man is certain to be
retained in every department. I look
for no general upheaval," declared
this gentleman.
The governor will have to appoint
one member of the board of control.
Commissioner Olson's term expires
this year. Commissioner Brown was
named as an interim appointee by
Governor Hanna to fill the vacancy
created by the death of Fred O. Brew
ster. He has two years more to serve.
Chairman Lewis holds over.
The governor will have one mem
ber of the" tax commission to name.
The term of Frank E1. Packard, chair
man, expires in May. There may be
some radical changes in both of these
commissions. It has been rumored
that the board of control may be re
organized to provide for a salaried
resident member, with two non-resi
dent members who will receive only
a per diem. It is hinted that similar
treatment may be given the state tax
commission, or that body may be dis
solved entirely and its duties confer
red on a board constituted in some
what the same manner as the state
board of equalization.
Frazier stands committed to econ
omy and efficiency. He may find
grounds for paring where there is a
multiplicity of boards or commissions
or department heads with overlapping
duties. If he does, he will consider
ably reduce his power to reward
friends, as the governor of North Da
kota even now has very few juicy
plums to distribute among the faith
ful.
Anthony Starke, one of the Timcs
Record's staunch friends, autoed out
from Fargo Tuesday in a Cadillac
"Special" which he had invested In
while in the Gate City. Even if wheat
treated the farmers pretty shabbily
this year, Anthony has the "coin-' to
get what he wants in a car, his 320
acre farm being a money-maker under
his efficient handling.
There will be a special meeting of
the B. Y. P. U. of the Baptist church
on Saturday evening at 8 o'clock in
the church. Every member is urged to
be present, as there is important bus
iness matters to be taken up.
