The Family Burial Lot
Love me little ; love me long."
The best love lasts, and it lasts beyond death.
We have seen a grave decked with flowers long
years after the burial. And those who remember and
honor their " parents passed away " are strengthened in
every good purpose themselves.
Then do not neglect the family burial lot. Only this
week we taw a burial lot actually inherited by swine.
We brushed aside the weeds and there were the marble
slabs, and scripture texts, and lines from Gray's Elegy in
a Country Church Yard, and names well known in Ken
tucky. Where were the descendants who should have
hallowed those graves?
Parents' Best Gifts
Parents have to give their children the family features
and the family name, and to these they sometimes add
some family property.
But the best gifts are family religion, family princi
ples, family industry and family skill.
Any mother may fix the character aud destiny of her
boy before he is six years old.
Any father owes it to his children to teach them all
the best things he knows, and give them the benefits of
his experience.

WORLD HEWS
The week has brought but slight
changes on the different frontiers
of the war. In the region of
the Somme, the French have mads
some gains, breaking a first line of
the Germans. On the Italian fron
tier, the Austrian have suffered in
the region of the Castro.
Fighting has been active in the Bal
kans. One army of Rumanians In
vading Austrian territory has been
driven back and is now on the de
fensive seeking to keep the Germans
and Austria from entering Ru
mania. Operations near the mouth
of the Danube in the Dobruja have
not been decisive.
England and France, in a reply to
a protest from the United States
against their interference with the
mails, have refused to give full satis
faction. They insist on the right to
stop the mails and examine them but
agree to be responsible for any fault,
abuse, or serious mistake that may
be made, when notified of such of
fense. "
The king of Norway has issued an
interesting and suggestive order
during the week. It forbids sub
marines from passing through Nor
wegian waters except in case of
emergency; and at such times the
submarine must be above water and
flying the national colors of her
country. '
All efforts to discover the sub
marine which did such damage to
merchant vessels off the New Eng
land coast have failed. It is be
lieved the vessel has returned to
Germany and that the act is of the
nature of a raid. Others of a sim
ilar kind may be expected. This
