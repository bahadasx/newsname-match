resolutions,
Be It Resolved, .
I
That we heartily endorse the nomi
nees of Ihe National convention of
the Republican party, and thoroughly
approve of the platform upon which
rests their candidacy.
II '
That we, thoroughly appreciate the
valuable and loyal service rendered
to the people of New Mexico by Hon
A. B. Full and Hon. T. B. Catron, our
present representatives in the Senate
of the United States, and Hon." B. C.
Hernandez in the House of Represen
tatives. And we do sincerely recom
mend for the welfare of the citizen
ship of our great state, and for the
support of a Republican National ad
ministration, the re-election of Hon.
B. C. Hernandez.
Ill
That we cordially endorse and ap
prove the nominees of the Republican
State Convention, and bespeak for
them a rousing majority from Union
County. That we point with pride to
the broad and constructive platform
adopted at the State convention of
the Republican party, to which is
pledged the loyal support of our nom
inees on the State ticket. That we
present to the people of Union county,
with especial emphasis, and with par
ticular enthusiasm that measure for
which the Union county delegation at
the State convention is in large de
gree responsible; that measure which
recognizes the voice of the people as
the ultimate umrirc on all questions
vitally affecting the life of the people;
that measure which must and can be
Bettled only by the vote of the people;
the plaiik in the Republican State
platform providing that the adoption
cf a constitutional amendment pro
hibiting the sale of intoxicating liq
uors in New Mexico shall be submit
ted to a vote of the electorate. And
we do hereby pledge our nominees for
both houses of the legislature to vote
for and support an Act in the 1917
legislature providing for the imme
diate submission of such question to
such vote.
IV
We do pledge our nominees for both
houses of the State legilature to vote
for and support legislation which will
secure to Union County its propor
tionate share of all funds to be ex
pended in the State for roads. That
we condemn the utter lack of system
atic road improvement and the waste
ful and erratic expenditure of the
road funda by the Democratic author
ities in Union County. And we do
strongly recommend that any Demo
cratic officials hereafter intrusted with
road funds will in the future preserve
from the devastating ravages of the
Clayton lake the receipts and vouchers
which show their disposition of such
funds.
.V
That we recommend to the atten
tion of the voti-rs of Union county the
record of the representatives of Un
ion county in the 1915 legislature,
Hon. E. B. Gallegos; Hon. O. T.
Toombs; and Hon. Candelario Vigil in
their, activity for and support of the
progressive school legislation enacted
by that Republican legislature.
VI
That we most strongly condemn
and depreciate the actions of the Dem
ocratic officials of Union county in
failing to send out ballot boxes to Re
publican precincts; in illegally chang
ing polling places contrary to the pub
lished notices thereof; and in chang
ing precinct lines shortly before elec
tions without affording the voters of
VIII
We condemn the action of demo
cratic officials in using the power of
their position to cloud the titles to
land through uncalled for, .unneces
sary and unwarranted mal-administra-tion
of the tax l.vs.
IX
We condemn the action of demo
cratic officials in the profligate and il
legal expenditure of the people's mon
ey in the matter of the last two pub
lications of delinquent tax lists in vi
olation of conformity to the laws of
1915, thereby causing great and use
less costs to the county and delinquent
taxpayers not sanctioned by the laws
of the commonwealth and demand a
return to the treasury of the people
all sums so illegally expended.
X
That we pledge our steadfast al
legiance and loyal support to each
and every nominee of this Convention.
That in the event that any nominee
shall die, resign, or refuse to accept
his nomination after the adjournment
of this convention, an executive com
mittee to consist of the County chair
man and four other representatives
to be selected by this convention shall
fill any such vacancy. .

Juan Vigil, Chairman.

SO THE VOTERS MAY KNOW
THE NOMINEES
Below we print a copy of a letter
sent to the clerk of Union county and
clerk of the eighth judicial district of
the State of New Mexico, by William
Eaton, an attorney who formerly
lived in Clayton and who is now a res
ident of Socorro, New Mexico. This
letter speaks for itself:
"Socorro, New Mexico,
October 14, 1916
Mr. Juan J. Duran,
District Clerk, Clayton, New Mexico.
Dear Sir:
The record you prepared in case
1532 does not show the date of the
filing of the complaint, or any of the
other pleadings. This record is ab
solutely worthless to me. I cannot
get into the Supreme Court with it.
I wish you would send me the date
of the filing of the complaint and the
filing of each and every other plead
ing in the case so I can prepare my
abstract.
I am getting pretty tired of wrest
ling with this case. You have lost all
my exhibits, you have failed to in
elude the copy of the decree, and you
have failed to include the records in
your office showing the docket entries
in case 955, and you have failed to
include the two tax receipts, which I
oltered in evidence and which are
down in the Treasurer's office.
I wish you would let me know
whether you can prepure these rec
ords so I can get into the Supreme
Court, and if not I am inclined to
apply to the Supreme Court to ap
point some one to go and prepare the
records. Let me hear from you.
Very respectfully,
W. J. EATON."
It will also be remembered by those
who are acquainted with the official
history of this same clerk of the coun
ty and district court that he had to
be mandamused to produce a public
record in which the. interests of the
taxpayers of this county were being
involved in the matter of delinquent
taxes being turned over to a syndicate
for adjustment and collection and
which the Citizen exposed at the time.
The syndicate was being secretly
formed and the negotiations were be
ing secretly carried on under cover and
the clerk of the board of county com
missioners, whoch is this same clerk,
was mandamused and made to produce
the records of the transactions which

which secret session such printing
was awarded to the highest, instead
of the lowest, bidder and which sub
sequent events have shown, according
to the record as shown elsewhere in
the issues of the Citizen, was plenty
"High" and Suthers too. And yet the

This is the same clerk who failed
to deliver a ballot-box to a precinct at
the last election thereby disfranchis
ing qualified electors in this county,
tnus jimmying legally qualified vo
ters of Union county and New Mexico
and the United States of America out
of their right of franchise and suf
frage, compelling them to appeal to
the legislature for an adjustment of
the result of this uncalled for action
and doctrine of jimmyocracy.
And this is the same clerk who has
been officiating in such matters as
concerned the records of Union coun
ty, the records of the district court
and the records of the board of coun
ty comissioners for about five years;
and this same clerk is asking you to
vote for him for another two years
of such administration. Do you want
any more of such incompetence and
mal-administration? Can you any
longer wonder why it is that the Citi
zen cannot and will not dignify such
administration by calling it "demo
cratic?" Or why it will dignify the
party to it by calling it a "demo
cratic" party? There is a difference
between jimmyocracy and democracy
and the Citizen will continue to call
things by their right names. If you

tration in three of the most impor-

Now Mr. Taxpayer, the above is not all the record shows but it is cer
tain that it shows that much. There is still more, but is not this enough for
one official organ in 18 quarters?
You will notice that our esteemed contemporary does not, except in a
very small degree and petty, uncalled-for-angry manner, account for or ex
plain to the people why the above is not an extravagant, profligate and un
paralleled amount in Union county to pay for the service required by law
to be furnished. The Citizen does not envy its contemporary a single dollar
of the money it has received, nor does it envy its contemporary its position
in the matter, nor does the Citizen envy its contemporary, the News, its pettj
peevish, unmanly, "liar-hurling" disposition, distempered tendencies, inordin
ate jimmycratic desires and inelegant demonstrations. These are not issues il
this campaign. The people want to know the facts and the Citizen is givinj
them the facts and the figures as shown by the jimmycratic record. Th
above contains the same totals originally charged by the Citizen. Can thej
be denied truthfully? And just remember, Mr. Taxpayer, these are the fig
ures of only one official organ.
Our contemporary admits that its "charge for the publication of the 1915
delinquent tax list was $584.77, exactly one-half of the legal rate allowed by
the republican publication law of the state." Moreover,-it says in connection
with this exuberant display of intellectual greatness in the discovery of a re
publican publication law of the state," that "we are glad to- state th-.it wo
have received payment for this work just as we are glad to get it from in
dividuals or firms for work performed."
Our contemporary must be in error about this being the 1915 d linquont
tax list as that list has not been published yet according to the treasurer's
announcement in the last publication, but it must have published a dcl'-quont
tax list i the year 1915, and that, no matter what ye.-ir it. was for. be
what it refers to as the "1915 delinquent tax list." Now any tax lidt n'-.b-lishcd
in the year 1915 should be governed by the laws of 1915, shouldn't it?
It is immaterial whether it be a republican law or a jimmycratic law, so long
as it is law, isn't it?
Very well, if that list, published in 1915, was somethin.-r like the one
published in 1916, it consisted of about 879 lines and that nt -M cuts a "no
produces $202.17, instead of $584.77' leaving $3S2.G0 the county has paid
more than it should have paid and more than was "allowed by the repub
lican publication law of the state." Now anybody who can figure can see
that $584.77 is just about $1.80.42 more than twice as much as this republi
can law "allowed," instead of being "exactly one-half" of tie amount allow
ed. . O, how magnanimous our contemporary was when it did $11G9.54 worth
of "legal work," under a republican law, for Union county for $584.77! If
our esteemed contemporary got $584.77 for one-half, the Spanish publica
tion was entitled to the same amount and the two would get $1109.54 for a
publication that," under "a republican publication law of the state" could fig
ure up but little more than $202.17 and allowing this double could exceed
but little more than $104.31 leaving about $765.20 the countv has paid moro
for a" publication than is "allowed by the republican publication law of tho
Btate " The recovery of something like this amount which has been illegal
ly puid cut is a matter for investigation by the gran i jury ana district ni
orney and if Orie L. Phillips is elected he will see that this is done. Our con
temporary has come to the anxious seat and confessed. What more is neces
sary? Evtrj time it opens its mouth it puts its foot in it.
If our esteemed contemporary could leave off its unmanly, unwarranted
habit of hurling the inelegant term "liar" at everything of an-official na
ture shown by the jimmycratic record that does not look good to taxpayers
and voters, and get down to the "brass tacks" of official facts, it might have
a better claim to decency and honesty in the ordinary details of common and
official life. It is challenged to a show down of recorded facts, not filagree
filibuster. .
