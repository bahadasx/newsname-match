fered and thoy carried, a shotgun
with them to the field, In order, It Is

COUNCIL DISCUSSES
BUDGET OF EXPENSES
$2500 ut in for Johit City and Ooun
tjr Whrary If Differences are Ad-j
uted or Otherwise for Maintenance
of Separate CTty Library. J
Discuaslon of the budget of ex-1
penes for the next year was the!
principal business of the council last!
evening. Cpon the recommendation I
of Councilman Murphy, chairman of
the finance committee, an Item ol,
$2500 was put in the budget for li-
brary purposes, the same to be used as
the city's share of maintaining thej
Joint city and county library If the
present differences are adjusted,
otherwise to be used for the mainte
nance of a separate city library.
The appropriation for the police
department a' recommended by the fi
nance committee will be only $5600
as against $6500 last year. This re
duction results from the saving of
$1200 on the appropriation made
a year ago, the figures of Chief Gur
dane showing that the police de
partment has cost cons'derably leu
this year than last. The cemetery
appropratlon will be increased from
$500 to $800.
A lively tilt occurred when Coun
cilman Murphy reoommended against
the purchase of an automobile for
the fire department at this time, de
claring that there Is no money avail
able. He took the position that it was
false economy to buy a cheap car In
asmuch as the proposed car would
have to haul 500 feet of hose. He was
of the opinion that at the end of the
present tax year, next April, a suit
able car could be purchased.
Councilman Phelps was of the same
opinion about the standard of car to
be bought but held out strongly for
the 'Immediate purchase, declaring
the protect'on of the Pty demands the
extra equipment. Councilman Ell.
chairman of the fire committee, de
clared the recommendation for a
$1200 car was made for the sole pur
pose of killing the proposition and
declared positively that a $400 car
would suffice. The matter was held
over until next meeting.
In the absence of Mayor Rest, who
attended the W. C. T. U. banquet.
Councilman Murphy presided last
evening.
The ordinance defining a dimmer
was read last evening but not voted
upon. Concllman Phelps declared he
would not vote for It or any other or
dinance until some of the present or
dinances are enforced.

of the Monroe street improvement
was passed.
