miles below thla city, on some busi

flai -.I several eastbotind trains and
switched them over to the westbound
track allowing them to proceed slo'vly
to Maysvllle where Ihey could return
to the eastbonnd track The section
men Immediately responded to Mr.
Hnaler's call to repluce the rail bnt it
could not be set for some period of
time so as to allow trains to run over
the track. During this time Mr. Has

Mr. Hasler's act will win much
recognition for him from the higher

"The Square Deal Man
l-oulsvllle, Ky., October 1 The
odore Roosevelt addressed a crowd
that occupied all available space in j
the auditorium of HwHl I Mil Park
last night. Ills speech was almost en
tirely a personal attack upon Presi
dent Wilson. Hy ridicule and abuse
of the foreign policy of Mr. WIIon, he
sought to show why the Itepnblhan
party should be restored to power
lie said the President hail been guilty
of the following:
"Yielding to force in the enactment
of the Adamson eight-hour law for
railroad men:
"Falling to hold Germany to strict
accountability for the Invasion of Hol
gluni "Saying he was 'too proud to fl?ht'
over the murder of 1.394 men v omer
and children on the I.usltania ;
"Falling to protect property rights
of American citizens nganst Orea
Britain'! blockade:
"Prostituting America's National
honor to Mexican bandits. In return
for which he haa won only a venom
ous and treacherous hostility to the
1'iiiled States;
"Instead of speaking sofetv ami nr
rylng a 'big stick' President Wllsot:
spoke bombastically and carried a
dlKhrag." said Colonel Roosevelt.
I arrial Attack
An example of the general tone at
Colonel Roosevelt's attack upon Pres'
(lent Wilson waa given by his refer
ence to the attack by Carranza sol
diers upon American troop Wl at Or
rizal. He referred to General Tn '
no's statement thnt Pershing's force!'
should move neither Kast nor West
nor South, but only North, and to
President Wilson's alleged statement
that "Such a proposition was Inad
missible." "Kven after Hoyd and Adair had
moved in violation of that order am!
net their deaths. Mr. Wilson did not
so much as slap Carranza on the
wrist," said Colonel Roosevelt, slap
ping his own wrist. "To this day there
has boon not a word said about atone
ment for the Uvea of American sol
diers killed in the performance of P
duty for which they were sent to Mex
ico by the President "
Colonel Roosevelt scored the Pres
ident for the appointment of .Newton

declared that Secretary Maker was an
filch pacifist and as a boy never even
played with tin soldiers because
was "brutal."
When he referred to the claim that
President Wilson has kept the country
out of war Colonel Roosevelt put a
note of sarcasm in his voice.
" Dur inn the seven and a half years
I was President." lie said, 'not a allot
was fired by an American sailor or
soldier and not one American citizen
waa hurt or killed by the agents of
any foreign Kovernment."
Colonel Roosevelt referred to the
"I'i'-'h-souiidiiiK words of Mr. Wilson
which have not been backed bv
deeds." He declared they were not
worth the paper they were pruned on
or the breath it took to utter them
If Jackson or Cleveland Imd said what

would have meant a ureal deal more
