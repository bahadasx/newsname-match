Prosperity Wave Strikes Tacoma
Business Men In All
Lines Join In Report
That Trade Is Better
Than For Years Past
By Mabel Abbott
Once upon a time a little girl
lat in a rowboat high and dry on
the beach and looked disconso
lately at the waves that pushed
apward and slid backward, far
lnwn a long slope of sand.
The little girl knew about
tides —that Is, people had ex
plained them to her, and she had
«een the waves slapping the very
top of the beach, and the row
boat Joyously afloat on them. Hut
that seemed to her a very long
time ago.
Grown-up people told her the
tide would come back and float
lhe boat again by and by. But
meanwhile, she couldn't get it
down to the water, and there was
no fun in sitting iv a boat on the
dry sand, and the water didn't
seem to be getting a single bit
nearer, though she had watched
and watched until her eyes
ached; and she didn't believe It
was going to come back again
anyway, so there!
And the little girl curled up in
the boat and went to sleep.
And the tide came in.
Slowly and quietly It crept up I
and up and up—nearer and near
er the boat —all around It —under
it —beyond It —
And the little girl woke up and
found herself already afloat on
the tide she thought was never
foing to come back.
• • •
I've been going up and
down the streets of Tacoma
yesterday and today, asking
Tacoma business men one
question, "How's business?"
I feel like the little girl in
the iMiat.
A tide has crept np around
ns no slowly and so quietly
we have not realized it.
It is the tide of prosperity.
This Is no "boom" story.
Heaven preserve Tacoma from
another boom, with Its inevitable
collapse.
It Is a story of a normal and
wholesome thing, told by level
headed, conservative men, who
know what they are talking about.
—And after this preamble, I'll let
them tell it.
"How's business? Twenty-five
per rent ahead of last year. Sep
tember was the biggest month we
have ever had," said Charles
Drury, the tailor, the first man
»f whom I asked my question.
"And things look bright for the
ruture. I think you'll hear the
«arae story everywhere you go.
Business has never been better
'.taan it is right now."
Prosiierlty Here.
"How's business? Well, here's
i thing to consider," said George
0. Gove, of the big architural
tirm of Heath ft Gove.
"We have more city work than
we had last year, and it is nearly
ill remodeling and alterations to

stores, manufacturing plants and
hotels. These are being made be
cause the business men, manu
facturers and hotel men have
been compelled to make them to
keep up with the growth of their
business, or because they see new
business* coming for which they
must enlarge. They are an effect
of prosperity, not a cause. The
prosperity Is already here.
"When things reach this point,
the whole tendency Is upward. If
one man remodels his store front,
his neighbor and his competitor
promptly do so, too, so as not to
be left behind. I could point to
whole blocks in Tacoma that have
been or are being rejuvenated be
cause of this upward tendency."
Reminds of Ituiit.
Charles L. Hufford, vice presi
dent anil manager of the Peoples
Store, stood at one of the big win
dows of his office and looked
down at the busy street.
"It makes me think of the good
times in 19(16," he said. "Busi
ness is remarkable. And not only
business, but collections. 1 think
one reason Is the big payrolls the
city has at present. There seem
to be no Idle men on the streets.
We cash thousands of dollars in
paychecks. When payrolls are
good, business is on a good basis."

Duff is doing today, on

Ed Ignorance to the actions of his
deputies, particularly Detective
Fred Shaw.
I'nder threats of the police ex
ecutives that they would expose
some of the recent acta of Detect
ive Shaw, Remann promised that
he would give orders for Shaw to
keep completely out of all police
raids on liquor, or other cases, un
less invited to take part.
The trouble started early this
week, when Shaw seized five bar
rels of whisky at a Tacoma dock,
while the police were watching
the booze in the hope of catching
the owner.
Keiiiaiin advised Pettit and
Smith that he would not only re
fuse to permit his men to ever In
terfere again with police work,
but that he would co-operate with
the police in all booze cases.
'''I will show my good faith with
the police by filing a state charge
against every bootlegger or other
person caught by the police for
handling booze illegally," Re
mann is said to have declared.
As a test of Remann's good
faith, the police staged a raid lesa
than a half hour after the inter
ne w.
Detectives Wiley and Garberg
arrested Harry Bell, proprietor of
Bell's drug store, Sixth avenue
and Anderson streets, charging
him with having sold liquor Ille
gally.
While Bell was at police head
quarters, arranging ball, the pro*.
ecutor'R men, In conjunction with
lhe police, raided the drug store,
seizing a quantity of whisky and
other liquors. When Bell was re
leased on |100 bail by the police
he was re-arrested by the connty
officials, and not released until he
had deposited $500 additional on
a state charge.
A check on the amount of
liquor in the pharmacy Thursday
morning by the police showed
that Bell had sold a much larger
quantity of booze on preeriK'imH
than lie had ever purchased
through legal channels, according
to Commissioner Pettit.
