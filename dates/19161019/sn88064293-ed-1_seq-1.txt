To the Insuring Public
The trouble and expenses incur
red by th- Loral Insurance Agents,
because of their inability to collect
their premiums, and the frequent
losses by non-payments has become
so much of a tax on their business
that they have found it necessary 4 o
limit all credit for premiums to 60
days from date of policy. Hereafter,
satisfactory settlement must be made
within that time, otherwise the policy
will be cancelled, for such non-pay
ment.

VILLA UPSET PLAN OF
MEXICAN ENVOYS
Reports that Pançho Villa has
reached the Hearst ranch at Babi
cora considerably upset the delibera
tions of the Mexican peace commis
sion today.
The American delegates emphas
ized the point that if Villa had pene
trated this far north, Carranza must
begin his promised drive immediate
ly or it might be necessary for Gen.
Pershing to strike again and strike
hard.
Senor Cabrera, head of the Mexi
can delegation replied that Carran
za's new campaign against Villa had
already begun and news of a clash
was expected momentarily.
He explained that troops were be
ing moved north in relays. The Amer
ican replied that the present situa
tion had become so grave that it de
manded more than promises,
j The advice of Gen. Bliss to the
! American delegate was that Gen.
Pershing would be compelled to act
immediately should Carranza's
j "drive" prove an idle promise.
