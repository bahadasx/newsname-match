Great West rulm Company [recting A
Temporary Studio In This City
Â¶'he Great West Film company is
erecting a temporary studio on the
vacant lots just east of the Roy Dil
lon shop on Water street, and here
the balance of their big feature, 'The
Golden Goddess," will be filmed.
This studio will be used for the in
terior scenes of the big feature, the
out-door scenes having been taken
in the Little Rockies and some in our
city.
Gemteral'Mrnager 'Bill" Tobin re
turned front St. Paul this week and
in an interview with a representative
of The Enterprise, said: "The work
that has been sent east for ,finishing
is turning out great and I amt more
than puleased with the films taken so
far and feel s~ure that when wt' are
reatdy to release this picture about
January 1st, it will be one of the
best to he had in the film market
today. In coming here to Montana
there was a little feeling of resent
moint on the part of some of our
people, who were of the impresrion
that everything out here was wild
and wvooly, but after arriving here
and getting such a warm reception
front he good people of Malta, their'
ti~its of the great west have tinder-i
gone a great change and now we are.
in doubt as to whether we can ever
get 1 ho company to leave the west
fc;r cut' 'aster istudios."
Continuing Mr Tobin said, "The
James "Not Guilty"
Just as we- go to press- we
learn that the jury who have
been out since last night on the
James murder case, returned a
verdict of "Not Guilty" and
James has become a free man.
The attention of Judge Utter's
court has been taken up since It con
vened with the case of the State of
Montana vs. Walter James, who is
charged with the killing of John
Hutton at Saco last August. There
was some dispute arose last week
over allowing Attorney Hurd to as
sist in the prosecution of the case
and Judge Utter ruled that he would
not be permitted to assist with the
case for the state. Attorney Hurd
immsediately notified his partner, Ex
Governor Norris, who in turn took
the matter up with the supreme
court, who secured a writ that put
a stop to the trial of the case until
the matter could be presented in
Helena.
The county commissioners togeth
er with Attorney Wolfe, appeared in
Helena and Attorney Hurd was per
nitted to assist with the prosecution
-which was continued Tuesday after

It may not he generally knowr
that the Great West company wa,,
fortunate in securing one of the
greatest little film stars to help fin
ish the big feature after their lead
ing lady had resigned. She is no oth
er than Miss Margarie Daw, a formes
Paramount star of the Jesse L Las

; he Orpheum here many times. Misr
Daw Is mal-ing good out in the hills
with the Great West company and
says she is of the opinion this will
he one of the best pictures in which
~he has aplpeared.
The entire company will he in

the week, and Monday morning work
will commence at the Malta btudio

money held by the State Savings
hank of Butte has been returned to
its stockholders. Yet the state ex
-aminer admits, in his official report..
that he had known for many months
that the hank was on the verge of
Jfailure. Let's have a change of ad
ii ministration!
Many of the state papers have t~ak
en to calling the republican candi
date for governor "Fighting Frank
Edwards." It's not a bad title.
Frank Edwards has been fighting
corporation and political crooked
_ ness all his life, and he has never
lost a fight. Predictions are (reel,
mnde that he will win the present,
one by at least 20,000 majoriay.
The Odd Fellow's lodge will give
a dance in their hall on election
night.
It has been the hbitory of all par
r ani administrations. of govern
cants, whether elate, county or mu
iieiptil, that, any political party too
'wtig enthroned in power, becomes
tax in its methods of administration,
r'areless, indifferent to its duties,
'avish of public expenditures, over
liberal in providing new offices and
a host of needless deputies and
clerks.
More often than not, the party
long in office becomes corrupt and
wasteful of public funds. It builds
up ap olitical machine to perpetuate
inseif in office and ignores the rights
of the people.
This condition of unrestrained
power, these abuses and vices now
aer pdevalent in the democratic par
ty in this state. During the last
two democratic administrations the,
creation of new offices and bureaus,
each with a swarm of deputies and
clerks, has become chronic, and
state officials and understrappeds
have been multiplied, until, as Sen
ator Romney, democrat, well says,
that "the forty vacant offices in the
Capitol are now filled to overflow
ing, and that if the Stewart admin
istration is continued for another
four years, it will be necessary to
build two more wings to the Capitol
to accommodate the increasing num
her of new state employes."
Nor is this multiplication of state
employees the only cause for criti
cism and condemnation of the Stew
art administration. For the first
time in the history of state admin
istrations a stain has beeni put upon
the state. A federal grand jury has
exposed a condition of malpractice
among elected state afficials that
calls aloud for redress and punish
ment. State offices have been com
mercialized. States offices have been
used as a vantage ground to launch
corporations to prey upon the people
and to enrich the pockets of state
officials. They have made merchan
dlise of public office for their own en
richment and to the detriment of the
people. There is a regular Tammany
ring organized at the state house for
the same purpose and using the same
methods that have made Tammany
notorious.
Every day come reports of new
mulicials abuses, until the people have
becomse suspicious that where so
much of evil is known there must
be many abuses and cases of mal
administration hidden and unknown.
The only way to learn the whole
truth is to elect an enttre new set
of officials andturn 'the present in
cumbents out, so that a thorough in
vestigation can he made into every
department and bureau of admninis
tration. It is necessary to open thi&'
books and make a thorough renova
tion.
The democrats can not fool th(
farmers of Montana with this hun"
combe that prosperity is a~ttrihutahh(
to democratic legislation. Our peea
pie are far too intelligent to accepi
any such doctrine as that.
They realize that the prices they
are getting for their products today
are due to the European war and
that they are getting them in spit(s
of, and not through the assistance of
the democratic administration in
Washington
The wool growers of Montana
have their six-cent wool experiencc
from the Cleveland regime; the best
crowers have vivid recollection oi
he collapse of our vast sugar-been
ildustry under democra tic govern
a 11),1 theories; the stock growers
have only to look at the market
h:eets to see that democratic soar
-uses in national campaigns have
invvariably made prices tumhble; ihe
lumher men have had the leanest
days of their experience under dem
ocratic rule; the mining industry
suffeder severely in competition with
foreign ores mined by foreign labor.
Our orchards, our grain fields
and our flax industry have reflect
ed the blight of democratic legisla
tion in the influx of these products
from the vast empire of Western
Canada which adjoins us.
Bald statements from imported
democratic campaign speakers,
whose very words betray an utter
ignorance of the conditions in Mon
tana, do not stand the acid test of
the Montanan. Our people are fa
miliar with actual conditions and
they realize that If the democrats
remain in power, the minute the
war is over down will go the market,

Mr. Hughes made a splendid im
pression In Montana. Not only in
the farming and stockgrowing sec
tions was he greeted with the utmost
enthusiasm, but in the great labor
centers like Butte, he found large
sympathetic audiences which
cheered his utterances and extend
ed him a tharaughly Montana wel
come. One instance will Illustrate
It was learned in Billings in the af
ternoon, that, according to the train
schedule, the Hughes party would
not arrive until midnight. In half
an hour the people of Billintngs col
lected a jackpot of $1150 and en
gaged a special thain which brought
Mr. Hughes into Montana's eastern
metropolis at seven o'clock, in time
to speak to a cheering audience of
7,000 people.
There is not. a doubt in my mind
that Montana will give Mr. Hughes
a majority. I would not be sur
prised to see the republican elec
tors have a majority of 15,000. Our
people are utterly disgusted with
President Wilson's Mexican policy
and his wish-washy attitude in (heal
ing with the situations that. have
arisen out or the war.
We 1haxv~ a spilendid party organi.
-cation in Montana. The progressives
have talc-n their coats off and arc
-working as a unit with their formei
conferes. They have a strong rep
resentation on both our state and
national tickets and there isn't P.
-sorel~eadl in the bunch.
Former Ulnited Senator Joe Dixon,
manager of the Roosevelt campaign,
four years ago, is warking tooth and
nail for the success of the republi
can ticket. He didn't wait for the
self, but anticipated the action of
self, but naticipated the action of
his party leaders hy three motnhs
and, with his newspaper, is making
a most effective campaign for Hughes
and the state ticket throughout west
era Montana.
Whatever strength the democrats
had in the state two months ago is
dwindling as the election approaches
and I confidently expect that Mon
tana will not only give Mr. Hughes
a splendid majority, hut will send
a republican senator and two repre
sentatives to Washington to carry
out the constructive sensible pro
gram outlined in the national plat
form.
THOMAS QUALLEY DIES

Though not entirely unexpected,
the news on Friday morning of the

Sugar Beets
Valuable Advice For Farmers In The
Mvilk River Valley Section
The following extracts from an
address made by W. L. Petrikin, be
fore the Fifteenth Annual conven
tion of the American National Live
Stock association, is interesting to
the men who have land capable of
irrigation ini the Milk River valley.
Professor Henry, in his "Feeds
and Feeding," makes the following
statement: "A farming community
which will intelligetnly grow beets,
and utilize the pulp resulting from
them in the feeding of cattle, will
be able to grow as -large crops, in
addition to the beets, as were pro
dluced before adding that industry,
and to maintain many more cattle
than was possible before beet-farm
ing was inaugurated. This state
metn is warranted by the conditions
prevailing in the best districts ot
Eiurope. Beet culture means more
cattle and larger crops generally,
rather than less, provided always
that the pulp from the beets is prop
erly utilized."
To suns up: An acre of sugar
beets produces from 2,000 to 3,000
pounds of granulated sugar, worth
on an average from four to five
cents per pound at tthe factory, or
from $80 to $150 per acre; in addi
tion to the possible production of
300 pounds of beef, worth form $15
1o $18 per acre. There is no other
staple crop today whose market is
practically unlimited, which can
produce such values per acre. These
values produced per acre justify the
expenditure of large sums of money
on th efarm and in the factory.
The hand labor on 10,000 acres
of beets occupies at least 400 fam
ilies for a half-year. The working
up of the crop in the factory and
the maintenance of the factory dur
ing the idle season, will necessitate
at least the labor of 125 wage-earn
,ers the whole year: not mentioning
the labor necessary to mine the
large quantities of coal and lime
rock, of which about 22,000 tons
coal and 10,000 tons lime-rock are
cosumed per 10,000 acres, nor the

Trhe dleimcrats point to the pros
perity of the farmed. True, we had
last year the largest wheat crop in
our history, and we have sold inore
to Europe thau ever before. Our
cale of wheat to Europe during the
first year of the war compared with
the first year of the present tariff
'aw in time of peace increased from
$103,596,000 worth to $316,262,000
worth, a gain of 205 per cent. Our
wheat is used to feed thearmies of
Europe. But what was wheat worth
in this country at the beginning of
the awr? To show the effect that
the war has ha dluponi our prosper

to September , 1915,, the year of war
and tim second year of the Umnder

During the year of peace we sold
in breadstuffs to Europe 0181,484,

statement to say that the raising of
10,000 acres of sugar beets will pro
vide a living for 500 families in ad
dition to what the same area sup
ported before. That these figures
are not imaginary can be seen from
the wonderful increase of popula
tion in northern Colorado during the
lnst ten years, and also from the ef
fects of this Ifopulation when the
farmiers decided to curtil the beet
areas (luring the last two years, due
to unfavorable water conditions.
Then an increase in the density
of the population is a desirable thing
for the live-stock interests, in spite
of the grumbling of the old-time
stock and range man is obvious. It
must always lead to better prices,
due to the manintenance of the mar
