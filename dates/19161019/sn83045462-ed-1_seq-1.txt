SAYS HALF HOLIDAY
WILL BENEFIT U.S.
Chief Statistician of Bureau of
Labor Statistics Sees Good
in Proposed Plan.
NO COST TO GOVERNMENT
til-anting of the Saturday half holiday
all th?- year around to government clerks
will not decrease tic- output of the departments
in the least, nor necessitate
more clerks to d? the present amount of
work, nor call for larger appropriations
to do the same amount of work as at present.
These are the opinions of Kthelbert
Stewart, chief statistician of the bureau
of labor statistics of the Department of
"Labor, who cites statistics from manufacturing
and commercial establishments
all over the country t?> prove his contentions.
Mr. Stewart says that reduction of
hours has proved not only not to reduce
the output of work, but has engendered
such a spirit of good feeling that actually
increased outputs are the result from
greatly reduced working hours.
The Saturday half-holiday, as proposed,
would not necessitate another
penny of appropriation, Mr. Stewart
says.
Not to Cost U. S. a Cent.
"All the departments and bureaus are
asking for more appropriations, but it
is to do more work, not the same
amount of work that is being done
now," he continued. "The fact is that
every government bureau needs more
money to carry on its work, and it is
for this that increased appropriations
are being asked. The Saturday halfholiday
will not cost the government a
cent.
"The experience of the bureau of
labor statistics in the field has been
that the reduction of working hours,
either of manufacturing or commercial
establishments, does not mean a reduction
of output." Here Mr. Stewart
ited a letter, dated August 16. 1916.
from a varnish manufacturer, telling
how the establishment had reduced its j
working hours from sixtv to fifty hours
a week, and later to forty-seven hours,
without a decrease in output. Another
concern got increased output out of reItieed
hours, as did a stone cutting es :.blishment
in Buffalo.
Good Spirit Eng-endered.
It is the good spirit engendered by
:he Saturday half holiday which would
e the "big card" in the proposed plan,
!r. Stewart believes. At present, he
ointed out. "teamwork" plays a big j
art in the government service?that j
. that two or more clerks combine
?n a piece of work and together get
ut more work than many times their
lumber could individually.
The present system of "short time"
ave in vogue in the government serve.
an hour one day to do a little
-hopping, and two hours some other
day for this, that or the other errand,
interferes seriously with the teamwork
of the clerks.
"When a young girl comes to me to
?*t an hour off to do some shopping," I
Mr. Stewart said. "I hardly feel like I
refusing her. She can't go to the j
stores before she comes to work, and
;ifter our closing hour she has very
little time, indeed, to do any shopping,
if any time at all. as the stores close
shortly after the government's closing
hour.
Short-Time Leave Costly.
"And this system of 'short time'
; ave costs the government more in the
end than the Saturday h alf holiday
would." he continued. "And this is so
because it breaks up the teamwork between
employes of the government
which is so necessary."
With the Saturday half holiday in !
vogue. Mr. Stewart believes, the "short ;
rime" leaves of absence would be ma- 1
terially reduced, as the clerks would \
have all Saturda> afternoon to shop i
and to use for other necessary pur- J
poses, and thus would not feel the need !
<>f "short time" leave, and would not I
be expected to ask for it.

BELIEVE FLOUR WILL GO
BEYOND $12 A BARREL
Milling Centers Give Notice of
Further Advance in Price?The
Bread Situation Discussed.
I
Indications that flour will move to a
price even higher than yesterday's rec- j
ord of $1- a barrel were seen today]
both in the wheat market and in re- !
ports from big flour milling centers.
Dealers in this city received today no- j
tices that further advances may be ex- >
pected, owing to the rising quotations1
on the Chicago wheat exchange, where I
the grain rose nearly 3 cents a bushel
above the 7-cent advance of the day
previous. |
Bakers who were interviewed today |
on the possibility of an increase in the
prie. of bread held up their hands and
begged to be excused. Th< general im- J
pression prevails that tlm size of j
loaves must be decreased or the price 1
raised if bakers have to continue to
meet the increasing cost of raw materials.

The prices of best grades of flour rose
again today. Fancy patents, which rose
30 cents yesterday arid sold at $9.10 a
barrel, were quoted at 59.33 today. The
increase in price was due to a strong
foreign demand and the bullish condition
of the wheat market, millers declared.

The United States government, under the
anti-trust laws, will begin in this city a
suit to dissolve the alleged combination
of a number of large oil companies for
unlawfully fixing the price of gasoline,
according to the Chronicle today. United
States District Attorney John W. Preston
has been in conference with W. J I.
Parry, member of the federal trade commission,
for several days in regard to
bringing the suit. Parry is reported to
have turned over to Preston the data

AMSTKKDAM. Holland, October 19.?
The Volksz' itung of Cologne says:
, "German submarines will operate In
' They will visit the well known shipi
pinj? routes around the eastern point <>f
| Nantucket island and will sink British
: merchantmen after giving the crews
j opportunity to save themselves."
; The newspaper believes this activity
i will influence the supplying of food,
i especially grain, bacon and lard, to
! England.
! The Kriegs Zeitung, the evening edi!
lion of the Lokal Anzeiger, publishes
| a report that the British have ordered
i the arming of all merchantmen and
says that as a result Germany may he
forced to take up a sharper submarine
campaign, with consequent endangerment
of German-American relations. It
continues:
"If it is trut that England actually
intends to arm ail its merchantmen
with heavy and therefore far-carrying
guns and thus label them plainly as
warships intended for attack, it cannot
not. we must give a sharper tendency
to our submarine campaign.
Says IT. S. Could Not Tie Hands.
"We wonder whether it is not England's
precise intention." the Kriegs
Zeitung continues, "to bring us into
difficulties with other powers, particui
larly America, by its new measures.
America's answer regarding the admissibility
of submarines to neutral
harbors and waters was of course to be
expected. America, which in the future
intends to give wide play to the
submarines in its own navy, could not
possibly tie its hands by establishing
! important precedents.
| "Whether the United States with its
I conception of submarine warfare would
adopt any other conception and in case
i of intensification of our naval warfare
with England would relax its principles
is an open question. It is probable.
however, that if we desire to adapt
our method of warfare to the situation
created by the army of British merchantmen
we shall have to go over
carefully with the government of the
United States all the possibilities of
the newly created situation. For we!
may accept this much as now certain: j
Aside from a few jingoes and shoutersj
who would involve America in the war J
at any price, the American people
would dislike most greatly to have the
submarine question lead to a new dispute
between Germany and America."

W. H. Myers Explains Joint Bureau
for Collection of
Freight Charges.
ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND
I
The latest thing in the science of j
railroad ttransportation and its relation
to shippers, dealers and other business
men was explained today to the convention
of the Society of Railway
Financial Officers, in session at the RhS
leigh Hotel, by \V. H. Myers, manager j
of the newl\ efct <? hlished Kansas t'ity J
joint freight collection bureau As the
name of the new bureau indicates, its
work is to collect in Kansas City for
all railroads doing business in that
city freight charges due from shippers
and receivers, and. Mr. Myers pointed
out, there is no reason why there should
not be such a bureau in Washington or
any other city, the bureau having been
found a great success.
Great interest was shown in the address
of Mr. Myers by the treasurers
and other financial oflicers of railroads
from all over the country who are |
attending the convention. Fourteen !
railroads in Kansas City are partici- J
paring in the work of the bureau, which j
is the only one so far established in
the world, and Mr. Myers was heartily j
applauded when he said:
An Age of Specialization.
"This is the epoch in the history of
the railroad world when specializing
is not only desirable, but necessary. If
we wish to keep pace with the times
we must adopt the same advanced
methods as there are in the commercial
world, or, better still, improve upon i
them if possible. We are specializing
in the collection of transportation
charges.
"It is a well known fact that when
collections were- being made in Kansas
City by the railroads themselves the
payers were fully acquainted with the
fact that they must clear their ac- !
counts by the end of the month. But
they fell behind from the first to the
last of the month, promising settlement
from time to time. Under this plan the public
had the use of the money, and
the railroads, who are always heavy ];
interest on a vast amount of money. J
Under our plan of collection, we are J
just as rigid one day as another, and j o
if bills are not paid when due we are j a
immediately after the payer, insisting j \\
on immediate settlement." ! p
Mr. Myers explained that rate-making j e
bodies of the transportation world j ii
based freight rates on a cash basis, but j o
(that in the larger cities, where the j ^
j great volume of all the freight tratfic i e
of the country is handled, "we have un- h
(fortunately fallen into the habit of ex-j ^
tending credit on freight charges, which s
courtesy has been taken advantage of j
to such an extent that there are millions
and millions of dollars in the j
hands of the public in the United States a
i today that rightfully belongs in the J1
I treasuries of the railroads." a
c
Cannot Afford Credit.
*
j Mr. Myers added: u
j "In the commercial world it is the tj
general practice to allow a per cent off
! for cash, showing conclusively that the ! .
j prices of the commercial world are ; L
j based on a credit basis. Unfortunately, i |
jour rates are just the reverse. If we j
were permitted to add 2 per cent to ;
our published rates, we ccjuld afford to!
extend credit.
j "It has been estimated that through
specializing on collections. through j
(such a bureau as this, u have created !
ia saving in interest alone of many | *
thousands of dollars yearly, and 1 be- j *
lieve 1 am conservative when I claim j
a saving in Kansas City of from eight i
i to ten thousand dollars yearly in
| salaries for those who formerly did the ;
collection work, overlapping- each
others efforts, and duplicating the
work which is now done for all roads : j,
by our one bureau."

I of mankind that the street railway'1'

ing hand in hand with the steam rail-I t
! road interests, whereas, a few years j ^
ago. they were in entire opposition to j ^
each other. r
| Mr. Brandenburg's remarks relating p
to the Adamson law were based upon a
o
[a. text J if took from history, at the I
time th?> < 'ontinental Congress, in 1783, (j
was threatened by mutinous soldiers, j (
who demanded bounties, and who had | v
not received them. The (Continental i ^
(Congress, then sitting at Philadelphia, e
Mr. Brandenburg said, refused to be .
intimidated and moved its seat from
Philadelphia as a consequence of the .
threat. Afterward, as the result of a '
court-martial, two of the soldiers were
sentenced to death and others punished .
in other ways, although Congress par- 1
doned a number of the threatening j
troops.
Tax on American People.
"Does it occur to you gentlemen," Mr.
Brandenburg asked, "that if you, the "
financial men of the railroads, are cor- 0
reet in the statement that it will cost
the railroads $100,000,000 to comply V
with the recently enacted eight-hour H
law. what that means? It means an t;
investment on the part of the American T
people of $2,000,000,000, and every eiti- f
zen in the United States will have to go
down in his pocket to the extent of $20 d
for the benefit of the railroad train- j
men." (
Mr. Brandenburg, by implication, f
criticised the action x>f the last ('on- o
gress, which passed tne Adamson law, d
comparing that Congress to the reso- u
lute Continental Congress, which re- i;
fused to to# Intimidated, as he said the f

WAR TO LAST YEAR.
SAY MEN AT FRONT
British and Their German
Prisoners Do Not Expect
Eariy Close.
HARD STRUGGLE AHEAD
(CopvrijrSit. U?1G, l.y Tlio Assoria Press.)
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCK, October
IN. via Loim.Ioii, October 1h.-The
war ill last another year, according'
to the consensus of opinion among tlm
British soldiers and t.l.cir loaders. It is
also tin* opinion of the Germans, if the
views of prisoners count for anything.
Before T}|?> grand offensive started a
high authority informed the correspondent
of the Associated Press that
*" winiiii line would not be broken
this sumnifT and that slow operations,
wearing down the Germans, would be
inaugurated and would probably last
through another- summer. With the approach
of winter conditions, which
make military movements difficult, this
officer recalled his prediction, and,
speaking of the situation today, he
said'
"We know what the German resources
were and what ours were, and
the time ie?jiiir<-d to force a decisive
victory for our arms is a matter of calculation."
Expected Peace by Autumn.
German prisoners taken during the
summer invariably spoke of peace being
a certainty in the autumn. They
regarded the Somme thrust as a final
effort of the allies for a decision and
that after it peace would be made. Their
tone has been entirely different of late.
They recognize that it is a fight to a
finish between the man power and re-,
sources of the two foes and that an
ultimate decision will come from the
fearful attrition on the western front,
which now will know no intermission
until the end. The Germans are determined
to make every village on the
western front a fortress, which will
yield only when reduced to powder by
?hellfire, and every gulley and crater a
machine gun post to secure their defensive
against a critical defeat.
Purpose as to Rumania.
At a period when the weather is adverse
to offensive operations elsewhere i
the Germans apparently are concen- |
trating- every possible man and gun |
against Rumania. The view of the
British officers is that the Germans
hope to crush Rumania so that when
iney nave to face a common allien ot
fensive in the spring tliey may not have
to defend the immense length of the
Rumanian frontier in addition to what
they have had to defend this summer.
It is a universal remark among the i
British that never has the morale of
the prisoners varied more than now.
"You will not'i-e that we ar- always
taking >ners and that the Germans
get very few of ours," said a staff officer.
Die Rather Than Yield.
"Though small parties of our men
are bound to get into hazardous positions
in this kind of intricate operations
at close quarters, they die rather
than yield. This shows their morale
and the temper of the situation. Some
Germans have never fought better and
some have never fought so badly as in
the last few weeks. Today, for example,
twenty Germans practically threw
up their hands and walked into the
British lines. But the soldiers who i
took them prisoners or their command- i
t*r had 110 illusion that these prisoners I
typified the condition of the German
army as a whole. There were other
Germans who were ready to tight with
