Editor Journal:
I havo'been reading the "ram
bling recollections" of the Jour
nal for some time and am much
interested in them, and especially
those of little Johnny Himmel
mon. I can remember him as a
small, delicate, light-haired lad,
his father being the first barber to
cut my hair. The mothers those
days cut their boys' hair by plac
ing a bowl on their heads and cut
ting around tho edge of the bowl,
first wiping off tho lard to make it
cut easy.
I was born in Perrysburg 71
years ago the fourth of last June,
and have many loving memories
of my young school days. A Mrs.
Kiezia, Huntington was my first
teacher; then her sister, Laura
Huntington; afterwards a Mrs.
Wright, wife of Prof. Wright, of
the old blue covered elementary
spelling book, mother of Orville
and Charley Wright, who at
tended school at the same time.
My next teacher was a Mrs.
Banks, who used to punish the
boys by spanking them, and I
want to relate a little incident
that cured her of that stylo of
punishing.
One afternoon Dick Chappie,
James Graham, Tom Crook, Henry
Purvis, William' Shannon and my-
self were called upon the rostrum
to undergo the severe ordeal of a
good spanking. "Wo all hung our
heads down like chickens in a
rain storm. Dick Chappie was the
first. He went through with his
usual habit of making faces. Then
Hank Purvis with his slow
meandering way, laid across her
lap as if going to sleep. Then she
called Shannon. Ho hung back,
took short steps, with his legs
close together (his pants being
ripped both ways in the crotch).
He laid on her lap very meekly,
and when the old ruler camo down
with a whack both legs flew out.
Sarah Lawrence sereamed. Mary
anna Purvis yelled "Murder!"
and Sophy Gunn, Mary Albert,
Emma Cook, Sarah Ilollister,
(well, all the other girls) hid their
faces in their hands.
Well, that ended the spanking
business for all time.
My next'teacher was a Mr. Reid
in tho grammar school, and my
last teacher was Prof. J. Y. Phil
lips, who died at the Norton Ex
change hotel. He divided his
library with his scholars,- and I
still have the Latin reader and
grammar he gave me. I left Per
rysburg, shortly after my father
died in the spring of 18C0. My
mother, sister, brother and a niece
and nephew died with the cholera
in August, 1854. My people are
all buried in Wood and Lucas
counties.
I have read tho history of Wood
county by Charles Evers, and
there are some corrections I could
make and some additions, but on
the whole it is very good.
I had intended to attend tho
home coming two years ago, and
also the Centennial this year, but

The presidential campaign of
1880 was a great deal more lively
and exciting than had been the
one of 1876. The Republican con
vention met in Chicago, and for
some time previous to the date set
for its meeting some of the
friends of General Grant, who had
served as president for two terms,
headed by the Hon. Roscoo Conk
ling of New York, had made ef
forts to secure enough delegates
to force the nomination of Grant
for a third term. The opposition
to this plan was led by Hon. James
G. Blaine of Maine. When the
convention met both of these lead
ers made desperate efforts to win.
The balloting lasted for several
days, but Grant's strength could
not be broken, nor could he muster
enough delegates to secure the
nomination. Finally the name of
Hon. James A. Garfield of Ohio,
was put before the convention as
a "dark horse," and ho -was nomi
nated after more than thirty-five
ballots had been taken. The Re
publican ticket in this year stood
thus: For president, James A.
Garfield, of Ohio; for vice presi
dent, Chester A. Arthur, of New
York.
The candidates nominated by
the Democratic convention were:
For president, Gen. Winfield Scott
Hancock, of Pennsylvania, and
for vice president, Hon.. William
E. English, of Indiana. General
Hancock had .won very high
laurels as a major general in the
Union tinny during the war of the
rebellion, having for several years
commanded the famous Second
Army Corps, and was greatly
liked by nearly all ex-soldiers.
He had never had any experience
in politics previous to this year,
and did not'seek the nomination
which came to him.
The campaign in 'Perrysburg
opened early and was very
spirited from start to finish. The
Republicans early organized a
marching club of about GO mem
bers, which was called the "Gar
field Guards." Their outfit con
sisted of white duck caps with
black vizor and a brass ornament
above it, white duck coats and
pants, and long-handled torches,
and when on parade made a very
neat appearance. My dear old
friend, the late Capt. James Tim
mons, was the captain of the com
pany, also its drill master. This
company also had several trans
parencies witn appropriate in
scriptions. As an auxiliary, there
was formed a smaller company
composed entirely of colored men,
of whom Perrysburg contained
quite a number at that time. Their
outfit was the same as that of tho
larger company, and when on
parade they generally brought up
the rear. This smaller company
also had several transparencies
with suitable inscriptions. One
notable ono had on it the designs
of shackles and stocks such as
were used on obstreperous prison
ers years ago, and underneath the
words, "Our Stocks and Bonds in
1SG0." The late Samuel Butler,
being somewhat tall and erect,
was chosen to carry this banner,
and while Sam was not very much
on keeping step with the younger
members, he sure did carry that
banner in a dignified manner,
with his slow and measured tread.
Tho Garfield Guards did all
of their drilling in the open air

The October meeting of the as
sociation was held Thursday
night, President Pew presiding.
The question of admitting the
women of the village to active
membership was taken up. At
present there are no active lady
members ,although a Aumbur have
enrolled their names on the
honorary list. The women of Per
rysburg and vicinity have always
been eligible to active member
ship, with voting power, on- the
payment of one dollar yearly dues,
as provided in the constitution of
the association, and their presence
at tho meetings and their active
participation in its deliberations
is greatly desired. The secretary
will be greatly pleased to enroll
as members the names of every
woman in the village and adjacent
territory. The new 1917 cards
will re ready by the first meeting
in November.
President Pew urged that a
campaign bo commenced to secure
contributing memberships at $10
per yearns provided by the con
stitution.
By unanimous vote it was de
cided to pay the secretary a salary
of $G0 per year, commencing with
tho year 1917.
An amendment to the constitu
tion was introduced providing for
an additional membership class
known as sustaining members on
the payment of $5 per year. This
amendment will hay over until the
November meeting for final action.
