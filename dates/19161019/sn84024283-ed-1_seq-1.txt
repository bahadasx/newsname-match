Ironton News.
This Case Has a Hint for Many Register
Readers.
An Ironton woman has used Doan's
Kidney Pills.
She has fouud them as represented.
She wishes her neighbors to know.
She publicly recommends them.
No need to look further for a test
ed kidney remedy.
The proof of merit is here and can
be investigated.
Profit by Mrs. Rust's statement.
Mrs. Anderson Rust, Ironton, says:
"I had weak kidneys and my back
ached and pained. I felt tired and
run down and often had headaches
and dizzy spells. My kidneys acted
irregularly too. Finally I used Doan's
Kidney Pills that I got from the Ar
cadia Valley Drug Oo. They rid me of
the backache and put my kidneys in
good, working order."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get

Ey FRANK G. OBELI
Editor of the Nebraska Farm Magazine
The fanners of America recently
fnced n crisis, from which they were
delivered by prompt action by the
President of the United States the
threat of the nation-wide railway
strike. The railway managers and
the representatives of the 400,000 men
employed in train service, were dead
locked over hours of labor and wage
schedules. President Wilson volun
teered to net" as mediator, but had
no power to force arbitration. An
impasse was reached.
The Brotherhood issued a strike
order effective on Labor Day, Septem
ber 4. The railroad managements
showed that they recognized the Im
minence of the strike. Embargo or
ders were Issued on freight shipments.
Supplies and strike breakers were mo
bilized. The country waited, breath
lessly, for the storm to break. It was
apparent that neither side was bluf
fing. ' The President saw a national calam
ity impending. He called leaders of
his party into conference with him
and with them wrote the bill present
ed to Congress with the special mes
sage of the President next day. Nei
ther the railroads nor the railway
brotherhoods were- consulted. Neither
side knew what the bill contained;
neither made any demand, or had the
slightest influence In the framing of
the bill.
That portion of the bill providing an
eight-hour day for employes engaged
In the operation of trains became a
law. It was accepted by the Brother
hoods, the strike order was cancelled,
the calamity was averted.
No class stood to lose so much from
this strike as the farmer. A single
week of inactivity In freight and ex
press service would have paralyzed
his market for a month or more. Com
ing at the time of marketing of perish
able products, his loss from this
course alone would have run Into mil
lions. Staggering Losses Averted.
It is estimated by the railroad man
agements that the Increase in wages
because of the eight-hour day will
amount to from $50,000,000 to. $100,
000,000 a year. Allowing their high
est figure, $100,000,000, the farmers
of the United States would have lost
more than this In thirty days had
there not been a man In the White
House big enough to protect the in
terest of the whole people.

when they con piny the market at
tlielr own sweet will. It would have
ueimt $U).UOO.00O dollars' loss to the
.'ariuers on the billion bushel crop.
James K. Armsby, one of the larg
est shippers of fruit in California, a
Republican, recently said that if the
strike bud taken place it would havei
bankrupted many of the fruit growers
of that State. He said ft would have
caused a loss of not less than $20,000,-.
COO to the fruit industry of California,
alone. This amount is probably much
too low.
The peach crop now going to mar
ket, with a value of about $55,000,000,
would have been practically a total
Iocs. The $203,000,000 apple crop
would have shrunk by half in value.
Ths potato crop, of a value of about
$220,CCO,000 would have involved a
further loss of at least $50,000,000. The.
cabbage farmer of Northern Ohio, the
grower of tomatoes for the cannery,
and the celery grower of Michigan and
Florida would have kept mournful
company. Melons from Colorado, Cali
fornia, Arizona and Delaware, grapes
from western New York, and from
YaUlma and Wenatehee, prunes, pick
les, poultrjf butter and eggs would
have gone down in the common cata
clysm. What would a strike have meant to
the live stock market of the farmer?
And what would it have meant to the
consumer, with the cold storage facili
ties in control of the packers' com
bine? Would Have Paralyzed Industry.
The direct and immediate loss which
the farmer would have sustained in
case of a strike is but one phase of
the dunger which threatened his inter
ests. The depressing Influence upon
market prices, resulting from the in-i
ability of consumers to buy because of
luck of employment, would have been
Celt in every item of this year's farm
products. Take this single instance;
This telegram, sent to President Wil
son on September 2d by Henry Ford,
the world's greatest automobile manu
facturer: The President : The moment it
Is positively known that a strike
will become effective on the rail
roads, the Ford Motor Company
- will of absolute necessity shut
down its factory and all of its as
sembly plants throughout the
country, and every man of its more
than 40,000 workers will have to
go off the pay roll.
Our business is so organized
that the supplies and products
must be kept moving constantly.
We cannot move a day without
railroad service. We are making
2,200 cars every day. The materi-1
als must be moved In nnd cars
out. I sincerely hope something
can be done to avert the strike.
Your efforts are appreciated and
should be commended by every
citizen in the country.
HENRY FORD.
This telegram is typical of what
would have happened to practically
every American Industry had n strike
ensued. Millions of laborers would
have faced enforced Idleness, poverty
and destitution. The strike would
have paralyzed every American Indus
try nnd precipitated a panic, such as
has never been witnessed.
Has not the farmer good reason to
thank God that Woodrow Wilson was
In the White House, with nerve and
sanity enough to stop such a national
calamity?

Crisis for Nation's Toilers.
What the laborer didn't see under
the Republican regime was that High
Tariff does not regulate wages, but
makes it possible for the manufactur
er to so regulate prices that he can
control labor. The farmer, with his
characteristic self-reliance and natur
ally Independent spirit asked no fav
ors. All he wanted was an equal
chance with Other business men. Wil
son saw the farmers' Interests in a
big way.
The Rural Credits Act alone, of
more than a dozen big things this
Democratic Congress did for agricul
ture, gave greater direct benefits to
the farmers than any legislation en
acted since the creation of the Depart
ment of Agriculture a generation ago.
There came a time when the laborer
saw that his labor was a commodity,
a thing to be bought and sold, or re
strained or enjoined by the unwar
ranted Issuance of Injunction writs In
Federal courts; he saw that he did
not have the right guaranteed him
by our constitution of voluntary as
sociation for his own protection and
welfare; In short, he saw that he was
a wage slave f He saw that he was
up against Capital organized and en
trenched behind the Powerful Pull of
the Political Bosses of the Republican
High Flnancet,Gang, and Organized
Capital fought to prevent the organi
zation of Labor I
What did Labor demand? Merely
this : That Labor be made part of the
national councils; that its patriotism
be conceded; and that its knowledge
of Its own . needs give it paramount
voice In legislation directly and pe
culiarly affecting Its own rights.
And what has been the spirit of this
Democratic Administration? Let Sam
uel Gompers,. President of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor tell:
"In my experience with United
States Congresses during two score
years I have not seen anything like
(he fine spirit toward labor, toward
the rights and welfare of nil the
people, pervading all the branches of
lhe Wilson Administration. This fun
damental right spirit has guided the
Wilson Administration to wise and
righteous labor legislation."
In the age long struggle between
Capital, which has always had per
mission to combine, and Labor, which
was denied the right to combine, the
greatest step toward the full enfran
chisement of labor was recommended
by a Democratic President and put
Into law by a Democratic Congress
the anti-Injunction Amendment to
the Clayton Law.V ,' ' '
Farmers and Latarers of America
biggest of ail Big Interests the crest
of the crisis has come. You the big
element in our national life and the
real makers of our prosperity you
are to decide: Are we to continue a
democracy or are we to go back to the
Good Old Piflle of a specious adminis
tration which would buy your vote by
damning the man who has given you
what you asked for and gave it to
you because it was right and proper
and just!
Make no mistake. The Issue of this
campaign Is as plain as the nose on
your face. It is:
Big Interests vs. the biggest Inter
est!). Invisible Government vs. True Dem
ocracy. Big Words vs. Deeds.
Promises vs. Accomplishments.

State-Wide
By s petition of less than thirty
thousand voters of a voting pop
ulation of nearly eight hundred
thousand, state-wide prohibition is
again before the people of Missouri.
Although the petitions were in gener
al circulation for many months, only
the small number of signatures men
tioned was secured. This may have
been due to the fact that the tem
perance organizations were divided
on the subject, the older organization
failing to approve the raising of the
question at this time. The proposed
amendment is in more drastic form
this year than it was six years ago,
when the proposition was defeated
by a majority of 218,000. Although
there was no wide-spread demand
for a reconsideration of the question
of state -wide prohibition, the state is
again put to the expense of an elec
tion on the subject, and the people
will have to vote on it.
THE SQUARE DEAL
The fair man stands for the square
deal doing unto others as he would
be done by. He believes it is a poor
rule that won't work both ways.
If you are that kind of a man, we
want a word with you on the matter
of state-wide prohibition.
You have prohibition now in your
county through local option IF A
MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE FAV
OR IT. The large cities regulate the
liquor traffic via the High License
System a majority of the people fav
or it.
Would you think it fair to give the
large cities in Missouri the power to
vote saloons upon your COUNTY re
gardless of your protest in the matter?
Of course, you would not, and the
cities have no power nor disposition
to do such an unjust thing. That's
one way the prohibition rule works.
On the other hand, do you think it
fair for YOUR COUNTY to vote the
saloon out of the LARGE CITIES re
gardless of their protest in the mat
ter? You have the power, and you
may do that very unjust thing. That's
the OTHER way the prohibition rule
DOES'NT work.
If the large cities have no power to
make the county "wet,"why should the
county want to exercise its arbitrary
power to make cities dry? Should not
theoounty'DO AS IT WOULD BE
DONE BY? A square deal for the "dry"
COUNTIES, yes; but why should
there not also be a sqnare deal for
the CITIES? Should not the prohibi
tion rule be made to work BOTH
WAYS?
Ripley's Railroad.
E. P. Ripley, one of the bitterest
of the plutocratic leaders against the
Brotherhoods' fight for the eight-hour
law, who announced that his railroad
would not obey the law, is president
of the Santa Fe Railroad.
Despite the fact that $2,600,000 is
charged to loss due to storms, fires
and floods in its territory, the Santa
Fe Railroad, in its official statement
of expense for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1916, announces that the net
earnings of the road show an increase
of $8,457,398 over the preceding year.
Mr. Ripley signs the statement.
Enough said.
Iron County Taxpayers Aroused.
The taxpaying voters of Iron Coun
ty are beooming considerably aroused
over Judge Lamm's threats to change
the fiscal policy of the state. In or
der to understand what that policy
means to this county, let us consider
the record of 1915. Last year Iron
County paid into the state treasury

NUMBER 20.
Prohibition in
You believe in the majority rule
that's why your county is "wet" or
"dry" A MAJORITY OF THE PEO
PLE ARE RULING. When Missouri
votes on the "wet" and "dry" proposi
tion November 7th, should not
the majority rule? Of course, it
should, say you, and so say we all,
but it may not. If the state gives a
"dry" majority, all the state will be
"dry," a majority ruling that's ONE
way the prohibition rule works. But
if the state votes "wet," all the state
wUl not be "wet," a majority not rul
ingthat's the OTHER way the pro
hibition rule DOESN'T work.
A "wet" majority of 100,000 will not
make one additional foot of "wet"
territory in Missouri, while a "dry"
majority of one vote will make ALL
of the "wet" territory "dry." In
other words, the prohibition majority
rule does not work both ways. Is this
a SQUARE DEAL? Is it FAIR and
RIGHT? If a majority can make ALL
the Btate "dry," why should not a
majority make ALL the state "wet"?
WHO WILL ANSWER?
HOME RULE IN MISSOURI.
Twenty-seven years ago a local op
tion law was passed by the Missouri
General Assembly, which permits
each county in the state and cities of
over 2,500 inhabitants, to withhold
from or issue licenses to dramshops,
as the people of the respective cities
or counties may determine by their
votes.
This is true HOME RULE. It em
bodies the American principle of lo
cal government. Your COUNTY has
HOME RULE you have dealt with
the liquor traffic without OUTSIDE in
terference that is American and
Democratic But why should not the
LARGE CITIES have HOME RULE,
too, and be permitted to deal with the
liquor question as seems beet to them,
without OUTSIDE interference? You
don't want the CITIES to govern
YOU in this matter; why should YOU
want to govern the CITIES?
Don't you think that if your county
is permitted to be "wet" or "dry,"
as it may elect, that the CITIES
SHOULD HAVE THE SAME RIGHT?
Isn't that fair? ISN'T THE HOME
RULE :A SQUARE - DEAL FOR
CITIES AND COUNTRY ALIKE?
If you think the prohibition rule
should be made to work BOTH ways,
vote against the prohibition amend
ment. If you think the MAJORITY
SHOULD RULE, vote.against the pro
hibition amendment.
the sum of $6,775.99, and in the
same year the state of Missouri paid
over to Iron County the sum of $10,
668.99. This shows that the taxpayers
of Iron County not only enjoyed the
protection of the state government
free of charge, but that they received
an actual bonus of $3,893.00 in cold
cash.
It is believed that the taxpayers of
this county will have sufficient regard
for their own interests to cast their
votes unanimously againt Lamm on

Constitutional prohibition would at
a single stroke decapitate this prin
ciple of Home Rule and destroy at a
blow the inalienable right of self
government. CONSIDER THE COST.
A total of $7,121,227.61 was paid by
the liquor industry to the govern
ment of this state and the local sub
divisions thereof during the last two
year period, in LICENSE AND IN
SPECTION FEES ALONE. The
regular taxes paid by the distillers,
wholesalers, retailers and various
other industries allied with the so
called liquor industry, do not enter
into this total. If this scource of in
come is wiped out, this seven millions
of dollars will have to be made up.
THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE IT UP
IS TO INCREASE THE STATE,
CITY AND COUNTY TAXES. The
taxpayers will have to pay Beven mil
lion of dollars additional taxes. Why
should Missouri consider imposing
seven million of dollars additional
taxes on the people of the state at
this time? Can Missouri and the
counties and cities thereof afford to
wipe out this income of seven million
of dollars?
The taxpayers of Missouri are ask
ed to wipe out over half the income of
the state during the next biennial
period without putting any thing in
the place of it, and the farmer and
merchant and mechanic and banker
and professional man in Chariton
County, or any other county in Mis
souri, in which the saloons have been
voted out by the people under our
existing local option law, is asked to
increase his taxes about fifty per cent,
in order to deprive St. Louis, Kansas
City and other large cities of the
privilege of a regulated iiquor traffic,
which tia pebpli ol taa cities desire.
Taxpayers will no doubt carefully con
sider this proposition before voting
for state-wide prohibition. Other
people may try governmental experi
ments of all kinds without any feel

er foots the bills, and he has to count
the cost. Adv.
