RESOLUTIONS
. Whereas the Great and Su
preme ruler of the Universe has
in his infinite wisdom removed
from among us, one of our es
teemed and worthy fellow bro
thers, Brother Joe-' L. Oliver.
Whereas, the long and intimate
relation held with him in the
faithful discharge of his duties
in the Knights of Pythias makes
it eminently befitting to record
words of appreciation of him.
Resolved, that with heartfelt
sorrow and in deep sympathy
wit h. the bereaved relatives of
the deceased, we express our
hope that even so great a loss to
us all may be over ruled for good
by: Him, who doeth all things
well.
