Irrigation for
Foots Creek Rear
Single Day's Hunt: Narrow Avenue
Petitions for the establishment of
an irrigation district in the Foots
creek district will lie heard by the
county court November 9. The proj
ect embraces 1200 acres on the south
side of Foots creek, and according
to its promoters, but two landown
ers in the district are opposed to ir
rigation. Attorney C. M. Thomas of
Med ford is attending to the legal end
of the matter.

Jackson County bank is chairman of
the organization, and is assisted by
a committee composed of G. B. Al
den, Charles P. Champlin, D. II.
Head and committee from the Farm
ers' dug of Cold Hill. The circula
tion of the petitions Is now under
way.
The proposal of an Irrigation dis
trict In the Foots creek district Ik a
good omen of the increase of senti
ment through the valley for artifi
cial watering. Rain Is badly needed
at this time. Md ford Sun.
Ashland Boy
Highly Honored
Walker Thome, son of Mrs. O. II.
Johnson of Ashland, and who is a
fenior at the University of Washing
ton school of law, was one of the
honored few who were Invited to be-1
come members of Phi Alpha Delta,
honorary law fraternity at the uni
versity. Members are chosen be
cause of scholarship, activities and
goodfellowshlp and their prospects
for future success In the legal pro
fession? Walker Thome was a grad
uate of Ashland high school class of
1912 and made a remarkable record
In athletics and debating while hire.
He achieved an extraordinary honor
in being selected leader of the Uni
versity of Washington debating team
in his freshman year. He has not
participated in intercollegiate debat
ing since his first year, his studies
and outside work taking all of his
time.
Crowd Hears Talks
At Valley View
The Valley View school house was
filled with an interested crowd of
voters last Tuesday evening to hear
Borne of the republican speakers of
the county. Mrs. Herbert Hanna of
Medford opened the meeting with a
nolo which was followed by talks by
Ben. Sheldon, W. H. Gore and B. R.
Greer.
Band Concert
Cost Is Small
During the concert season from
May 24 to September 20 of the past
summer, the Ashland band gave thirty-four
concerts in Lithia park at an
average cost of $27.50 per concert,
according to the report of Treasurer
Clark Bush. Considering the high
grade of music which Ashland has
enjoyed this summer, this average
cost Is considerable of an achieve
ment. The total amount of cash re
ceived by the band for the season was
$1,128.75, of which $588.75 was
from popular subscription, $400 from
the springs water commission, $100
from the city council and $40 from
the park board. The expenditures
were as follows. Musicians, $637.20;
director, $200; outside bands,
$63.20; music and miscellaneous ex
pense, $36.55. A balance of $191.80
cash on hand is reported. This sure
ly bespeaks careful management of
finances on the part of the band boys.
The twice weekly concerts each
meant a rehearsal and an average of
four afternoons or evenings a week
were given by the band men to the
work. The band concerts were a big
feature during the past summer and
worth several times their cost to Ash
land. The band worked under a
handicap In many ways which a few
more dollars would have removed,
and It is hoped that a way may be
worked cut so that the leader may
be kept during the winter months
and a much better band, with result
ant better music; featured as one of
Ashland's big attractions next sum
mer. There is a movement on foot
to have a levy for the band included
in this year's tax, thus more evenly
distributing the. cost of a summer's
entertainment which Is enjoyed by
all and has been paid for by a few.
Registration Two to
One on Republicans
The final registration for Jackson
county shows an increase in the re
publican figures. Last year the re
publican registration was 4447, this
year 54S3. Only 39 progressives are
registered this year. The figures be
low show there are two republicans
to one democrat. The total registra
tion is 9340.
The figures are:

Land Crew Moves
North to Roseburg
The land grant classification crew
has finished Klamath, Jackson and
Josephine counties and has moved
north into Josephine county, making
headquarters at Hoseberg.
Douglas county has approximately
OT.0,00 acres of grant lands and it
will require about 60 days to finish
the classification in the county, ac
cording to word given out by Louis
L. Sharp. Coos county will be the
next county Invaded.
Civilization Has
Wonderful Punch
A picture with the gripping, effect
producing appeal f "Civilization"
has never before been shown in Ash
land. The gveat film production was
so stupendous, the effects so real and
the music so harmonized with the
action that the whole will be remem
bered by all the hundreds who heard
it as an event in their lives rather
than just a motion picture. The or
chestra alone was, worth going to
hear. Good sized crowds greeted the
picture at all four shows here.
City Doctor Will
Feel Medford Pulse
The city of Medford has hired an
expert municipal doctor to feel of
the pulse of the financial life-blood
of that city, prescribe tonics and, it
necessary, recommend an operation.
For several months past as many
plans as there are prominent citizens
almost have been offered the Med
ford city council for the purpose of
overcoming or relieving city financial
troubles caused by an over indul
gence in paving and other reasons.
When the expert, Howard Hansen
of Seattle, has evolved the treatment
he deems best it will be pnt np to
the people of Ashland's neighboring
city for their vote.
Change May Mean
Hill Line to Falls
A change in the business world
that Is taken by many local people
as highly significant for Klamath
county comes in the announcement
that Frederick E. Weyerhaeuser, son
of the late Frederick Weyerhaeuser,
multimillionlare tlmberman, has been
elected a director of the Great North
ern Railway company. The election
was held in St. Paul last w:eek. Mr.
Weyerhaeuser was elected to fill the
vacancy caused by the death of
James J. Hill.
Placing of Mr. Weyerhaeuser who
is now president of the Weyer
haeuser Timher company, on the
board of directors of Hill's railroads
is considered significant by some peo
ple because it may mean extension of
the Hill lines into Southern Oregon,
particularly into Klamath county,
where the Weyerhaeuser company
holds 87,000 acres of standing tim
ber. The Hill road is already as far
south as Bend and not a very long
extension would put it in the Klam
ath timber. Klamath Falls Herald.
Howard Rose received word from
Mrs. F. L. Fry this morning that she
would arrive home in Astoria today
from the trip east. She and Mir. Fry
accompanied the remains of J. J. Mc
Nalr back to his old home, where In
terment was made.
Appoints Teacher
To Library Board
Miss Rose Thomas, duughter of A.
W. Thomas of this city and a teacher
in the Ashland school, has been ap
pointed a member of the library
board to fill out the vacancy caused'
by the expiration of the term of F.
jE. Watson.
Miss Thomas is well Informed In
I regard to library matters and being
direct touch with the schools
tin
i should be a valuable addition to the
I board.
A Real and a Sham
Eight-Hour Law
The care with which the demo
cratic spellbinders and the demo
cratic newspaper organs avoid fur-
! ther discission of the Adamson bill
is not without significance. Indeed,
; it amounts to a practical confession
i that the measure is indefensible.
I That the' Adamson law follows
'precedent in the matter of rogulat -
j ing hours of labor is strikingly re -
i futed by comparison of the regula -
Hons on the Panama railroad oper
ated by the government with those
on railroads in the United States
to be operated after January 1, ac
cording to the Adamson law. Here
are the regulations in two cases.
On the Panainii Railroad
"F.ffective Sept. 1 the working day
for train crews and switching engine
crews win be limited to eight hours,
' except In cases of emergency, when
! authority for over time must lie oh
; tained through the proper channels,
I either from the executive office or
from the superintendent of the Pan
' ama railroad." Extract from order
j issued by Col. Gocthals as governor
, of the Canal and president of the
Panama canal.
On U. S. Itollioads
"Beginning Jan. 1, 1917, eight
I hours shall In contracts for labor
j and service be deemed 'a day's work
' for the purpose of reckoning the
I compensation for service of all em
j ployees engaged In any capac-
Ity in the operation of trains .
j For all liecessary time in excesB of
j eight hours, such employees shall
be paid at a rate not less than the
pro rata rate." Verbatim provision
of the Adamson law.
j The older relating to the Pana
I ma railroad, It will be observed, is
i a specific and definite regulation of
hours and labor. That is a real
i eight-hour law.
j The Adamson bill, however, adopts
the eight-hour period for what pur
pose? Not for the purpose of pro
hibiting labor beyond that length
! of time, but "for the purpose of
reckoning the compensation." Min

Characteristic
Of the Times
How characteristic of the Wilson
administration! It even affects local
democrats. A crlBis In Ashland' po
litical affairs such as the Wilsonites
seemed to 'regard the recent visit of
a few women, was met with a deluge
of carefulTy worded notes in the
"Wilson organ."
At Tuesday's council meeting Mr.
Banta reported that 10. F. Smith and
Ii. It. Greer had talked wlfh him con-1
coming widening Park avenue Just i
above the livery barn. Tlio proposed
widening would make the road 25
feet wider at the turn. According
to Mr. Itanta, Mr. Smith had offered !
. to give the slice needed off his prop-
erdy if tho city would buy him an.
equal amount off the property be-1
hind him, and Mr. Greer offered his j
gratiB. This is a very narrow place, i

I'ark avenue when congested at cele- 1

Paint on Gas Stove
Causes Small Fire
Cooking usphaltiim paint over a
pas stove is liable to result dlsas
trousously. At least Mrs. C. H. Gil
lette found this to be the ease. The
fire truck was called to the Gillette
home on High street Monday even
ing to find tho kitchen floor and
walls blazing. A pot of paint which
Mrs. Gillette was routing on the
stove had caught fire and upset,
running over the floor. The blaze--was
extinguished with the chemicals
and little damage resulted. Driver
Guiley says: "Tell 'em to boll paint
out In the yard or the middle of the
street, but by no means on a gas
stove
The firemen also ask that
people bo requested to take care to
speak slowly and distinctly whem
i phoning in a fire call. On several
! occasions recently the aid ot central
("has been necessary to find out where
i a call came from.

Grand Jury was discharged Monday
afternoon after considering four
criminal cases.
A not true bill was returned In
the case, of William Foster, charged
with a statutory crime.
True bills wero returned against
Richard Roo and John Doe, who
were out of the state.
True bills were also found against
Retha Swartzflger and Carl Dusen
berry of Gold Hiil, who were charg-
ed with contributing to the delin
quency of Mzzlo Horn, a minor sister
of Mrs. Swartzflger. Dusenberry is
