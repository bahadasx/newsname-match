THE WIDOW'S MITE
Idaho will pay in 1916 approximately
$75,000 in pensions to deserving moth
ers who have children dependent upon
them for support, or an average of
about $2000 to a county. This was the
information laid before the Hawthorne
Parent-Teachers' Association at the
Hawthorne school Friday afternoon by
H. A. Lawson, author of the mothers'
pension act, who secured its passage
through the legislature four years ago
as a member of the house of representa
tives from Ada county. He also inform
ed those in attendance at the associa
tion meeting that the best evidence
the law is doing a great deal of good
for mothers unfortunately left in cir
cumstances where they must have sup
port under the terms of the act, is the
fact that it has received general sup
port in all counties.

At a meeting of the executive com
mittee of the Utah-Idalio Sugar Com
pany ,held Saturday, the general man
ager was authorized to make anothei
ad\ ance of 50 cents per ton to all beet
growers, raising the figure to $6 a ton.
The increase will apply on all contracts
made for planting beets in the spring of
1917. It forms the third advance to
beet growers by thin company in the
last 12 months, the first one being 10
cents per ton given on last year's pro
duct; the second one of 50 cents per ton
on the present years crop now being
harvested.
General Manager Cutler stated to
day that the advance made would
amount to about $1,000,000 per an
num to farmers, more than they for
merly obtained. He said the new con
tracts would be made on a basis of
$6 per ton for beets polarizing 15 per
cent sugar; on beets running between
14 and 15 per cent the price would be
$5.75 and on beets running between 13
and 14 per cent, $5.50 would he paid.

School Quartet. Piano solo by Miss

DUBOIS NOT DUBIOUS
Predicting that President Woodrow
Wilson will carry Nebinsna, Wyoming,
Utah, Montana, Washington, Oregon,
and Idaho, and denouncing eastern
suffragists who are without the fran
chise, but are traveling through the
west in luxurious cars to tell western
women who have the franchise how to
vote, former United States Senator
Fred T. Dubois, recognized as one of
the shrewdest political managers,
dropped into Boise last Friday night
for a review of the Idaho situation,
lie has been looping-the-loop from Chi
cago to the coast and back with a view
of making an investigation of all the
states west of the Missouri river and
is traveling under the auspices of th >
Democratic national committee. He
believes President Wilson will carry
Idaho and that Governor Alexander
will be his close running mate. Hav
ing been associated with Tdalio poli
tics for years and thoroughly familiar
with conditions in this state an inter
view given out by Senator Dubois to
day will unquestionably be read with
great interest in Idaho. Mrs. Dubois
is accompanying her husband.

Town Factions
Great Detriment
Perhaps no other one factor wields
so great an influence in retarding the
growth and prosperity of a town as
factionalism. It spreads itself as a
pall over the ' community life, and un
der its malign influence all progress
wilts like a pear tree under the blight.
No amount of energy and public spir
itedness is sufficient to survive its de
pressing effects.
Take the average town torn by fac
tionalism. A measure of public im
provement is proposed. It comes from
one of the two factions. It really lias
merit and would be beneficial to the
town. Does it meet with approval?
Yes—from that side of the house. From
the other side of the house—bitter op
position. Why? No mortal man can
tell, except that it emanated from the
''other side."
There you have the meat in the eo
coanut. ''The other side" stands for
everything that is undesirable and vi
cious.
And it is a sad commentary on our
Christian civilization that this spirit
of bitter factionalism too frequently
originates where it should never be
found—in the churches. With them,
all too frequently, ''our folks" does
not mean, as it should, all of God's
ceatures, but it is contracted to ap
] ly to "our church," be it Method
AS THE EDITOR SEES IT
It is an old saying that two heads are
better than one, and on the same prin
ciple two heads together are better
than one when they are facing in oppo -
site directions. It will pay us to keep our
heads together in this town, for the
good of the town and each individual in
the town.
When we are facing in opposite di
rections and pulling apart we get no
where and accomplish nothing. The
result of our labors is a cipher.
But not so when we gel our heads to
gether. Not so when we act as a com
munity and not ns individuals. Not
so when we all face a definite object
ami pull until we get there.
It is good to keep our heads together.
We learn each other's ideas ami am
bitions and thoughts, and from this
knowledge springs the impetus that
brings success to any community.
Some people talk much ami do little.
Others talk little anal alo much. A
few are betwixt and between ami never
succeed in setting themselves or the
world afire.
There is ,however, a happy medium
which will afford us the necessary out
let for our thoughts ami yet serve the
good of the community at large.
Don't be a clam, and don't be a big
noise. Talk when you feel like it, but
talk sense and talk to the peojde who
have sense. When we do that we will
gradually bring to the surface the good
points in each other; we will open up
opportunities for the development of
the community, ami will be able to hit
upon the means of pushing our town
along.
The man who talks little but says
much when he aloes talk is often silent
when a little talk from him would ac
complish wonders. On the other hand,
the big noise is known us a noise ami
commands about as much attention
and remembrance as a guest of wind.
Talk up, but speak gently and to the
point. You will be both heard and
heealed.

Again, in many smaii towns, this
factionalism centers in the banks.
Each has its following. Each is striv
ing not only to build up its own for
tunes, but to tear down the other.
But from whatever source, the fact
remains—and the factionalism flour
ishes—a sad commentary on the boast
ed "progressiveness" of our country
men.
And the pity of it is that it is all
useless ii ii < l fruitful of no gooal resuts
to either siale.
United effort would invariably ac
complish for both what divided wrang
ling accomplishes for neither.
There is a world of truth in the old
emblem of ihe bundle of sticks, bound
together, which no man could break,
but which, taken separately, a child
cpuld destroy.
No factional fight in a community
ever yet resulted in complete victory
for either sialo.
Mirny communities have hail the sa
gacity to recognize ibis fact, while
there have always been and always will
be differences, have hail the good
sense to endeavor to harmonize and
work together for tin* common interest.
When we see a community torn by
factions, we feel like reminding it of
the obi fable of the eats and the
monkey—the cats found the clieeso,
but the monkey ate it at last.
IT CAN BE DONE
Somebody said it couldn't be done,
But he, with a chuckle, replied,
That "maybe it couldn't," but lie
would be one
Who wouldn't say till he tried.
So lie buckled right in, with a trace of
a grin
On his face; if lie worried lie hid it.
He stjjjted to sing as lie tackled the
V Amis.
That couldn't be alone, ami lie dial it.
Somebody scoffed, "O, you'll never do
that,
At least no one ever has alone it."
But lie took off his coat, and lie took
off his hat,
And the first thing we knew he'd be
gun it.
With the lift of his chili ami a bit of a
grin,
Without any doubting or quidalit,
He sturteal to sing as lie tackleil the*
thing
That couldn't be done, and he did it.
There are thousands to tell you it can't
be alone
There are thousands to prophesy
failure,
There are thousands to enumerate, one
by one,
The dangers that wait to assail you.
But just buckle in with a bit of a grin,
Then take off your coat and go to it,
.Just start in to sing as you tackle the
thing
That "can not be done," and you'll do
it!
—Edgar Guest.

PEOPLE YOU OUGHT TO KNOW
There are many people in this town
you ought to know,, for your own sake.
Some of them you may not know, but
you should.
You shoulal know the banker. He
is tin* one who supplies you with mon
ey when you neeal it, and cares for your
money when you have it. No town can
conduct modern business without him.
•You shoulal know each merchant.
They have the goods you want, and if
you know each one personally you also
know something of the wares they sell.
This enables vou to buy jmliciously and
saves you many a lost penny.
You should know the mechanic. Ev
ery time an improvement is made you
must call him in. Tf you know them all
you likewise know the one who is most
likely to give you the best service.
You should know the school teacher.
He is responsible to a great degree
for the moulding of the character of
your children, for the lessons they
learn while under his care are not for
gotten even to the brink of the grave.
Know him, and help him.
You shoulal know the farmer. He
holds the world in the hollow of his
hand. To him wo look for the pro
duction of the sustenance of life, and
without him we could not live.
You shoulal know the minister. Ho
is interested in you, though you may
give little thought to him. He does not
supply you with the bread you eat, or
the clothes you wear, but lie does beck
on you along the road to a better lift
beyond. Know him, and hear him,
and heed him.
Anal, brother, you should know the
sheriff. When the devil gets under
your hide the sheriff is a good man to
know. If you are inclined to kick up a
little dust your knowledge of him ma
cause you to pause before you kick.
Yes, brother, know the sheriff, for
while you are a good citizen he is your
friend, and when you cease to be good
he.puts you where you can be nothing
but good.
THE LOGICAL CANDIDATE
J. E. Good, tin* candidate for Pro
bate Jualge on tin* Republican ticket
being an attorney is, we believe, tin*
logical candidate for the office, in view
of the fact that a large per cent, of the
real property in the county goes through
the prolmte court evt-rv two years.
An attorney elected to that office
could better safeguard the property
rights of the widows and orphans than
a man who has no special knowledge
of the law. For this reason if for no
other, we believe Mr. Good shoulal re
ceive the hearty support of the voters
of Bingham county, regardless of par
ty affiliation.
The Catholic Ladies will serve a 5
o'clock chicken dinner at the V. I. S.
room on election day. The public cor
dially invited.
The ladies of the Baptist church will
hold a Christmas bazaar ami supper
on Saturday, Dec. 2nd.—Adv. tf

TRUTH ABOUT
CITY PUBLISHING
Tn last week's issue of "His" news
paper Trego indulged in another of his
characteristic fabrications, when he by
implication woulal have the public sus
picion that the Hon. L. R. Thomas, as
ity attorney, favoreal the Optimist in
the giving of city printing. In order
to continue his policy of freeze out he
offered to do the city printing without
ost, while this paper offereal to aio it
for 25 cents per inch—75 cents less
than he has got for the work for
years. From their kaowloilge of Trego
they were nfraial to trust him to alo
as he agreed without some kiiul of a
contract that woulal protect the city
against any probable kind of a liolal
up which was attempted on the county
by this same slick schemer, anal oralered
the city attorney to draw up a contract
binding him to alo the work for two
years. When Trego refused to act the
part of an honest man anal sign the
contract, the city council gave this
paper the work and was secureal by a
similar contract to the one rejected by
our unfair and unscrupulous competi
tor. If any one doubts the truth of
this statement anal has the least belief
in the veracity of Trego, we refer them
to the mayor and couneilmen. City
Attorney Thomas never favoreal this
paper, but on the contrary alloweal
Trego, on the threat of a lawsuit, to
charge the city $1.00 per inch for the
last city ballot when lie himself ap
peared before the county commission
ers and attorney and informell them
that the same class of work alone for
the county by Bingham's three news
papers was worth but 15 cents per
inch, and their bills were reduea'd $200.
Yet Trego had the nerve to charge the
city $1.00 per inch, and through lus
threat and attorney Htieceeak'il in get
ting it la*ss ten per cent. If ever City
Attorney Thomas done wrong it was in
this instance, when he advised the coun
cil to pay the bill and avoid a law
suit, as the county attorney anal
county commissioners know that* the
bill was both exhorbitiint and un
just. Yet this strange man Trego has
tho ainlncity and ingratitude to at
tempt to defame the name and repu
tation of his peer and benefactor, n
man who can rcinl his title clear, a pre
rogative that his woulal In* traalucer nev
er did possess to our knowledge. What
would be the fate of a man with Tre
go's record if lie were pursiieal anal
houmlod by an unscrupulous, desperate
and fearless blackmailer?
A FATAL ACCIDENT
Last Tuesday a very sail accident
occurred at the Aberdeen beet ilump,
in which Tobias Wedel lost his life.
An approaching engine frighteneal his
4-horse team and caused it and the
wagon to fall from the alitnip to the
ground. Mr. Wedel was so badly in
juriai that only da'atli could cm! his
suffering. He was about 30 years of
age and a very promising man, with a
wifi* anil 4-year old daughter, llis fu
neral will take place in Aberdeen to
morrow.
