TO SUPPORT A GREAT MORAL ISSUE
We, the undersigned, MINISTERS OF THE GOSPEL IN FREDERICK COUNTY, earnestly
urge the men of our several parishes, and all others of the electorate with whom our word may
have influence, to support the proposition, now before us, to prohibit the traffic in liquor in
Frederick County.
Others have presented to you, and with convincing argument will continue to present, the Economic Phase of the issue, showing that it is for
the financial interest of Frederick County that the traffic in liquor be prohibited. Physicians of the county have presented, and will continue to pre
sent, the Medical and Physical Phase, showing, out of their own experience as practitioners in this community, that it is for the physical well-being of
our people that the traffic Ik- suppressed, We, the spiritual leaders of the people committed to our care, desire to emphasize the MORAL PHASE.
With the possible exception of our physicians, there is no body of men who know more intimately the lives of the people of this county, their
sorrows and their joys, than do the Ministers of the Gospel. It is largely because we have seen, in the homes of our people, the poverty, the suffering
and the crime wrought by liquor that WE HAVE COME TO HATE IT Mil'll A HI FINING HAIRED. Ihe homes that have been broken; the
women’s hearts that have been crushed; the husbands and wives who have been separated; the lives which have been burdened by a hitter poverty and
by a bitter shame; the boys who have been shorn of their manhood and the girls who have been robbed of their virtue; the children who liave
denied the birthright of a happy home and the children who are worse orphans than if their fathers were in their graves, ALL THIS, THL LLCiI 11
MATE FRUIT OF LIQUOR, HAS MADE US THE UNCOMPROMISING FOES OF THE INIQUITOUS TRAFFIC. For the conservation of
the manhood and womanhood and childhood of Frederick County; in behalf of tempted men and suffering women and children; for the sake of the
homes of this community; in the name of Him Who began His ministry with the declaration that lie had come to heal the broken-hearted, to preach
deliverance to the captives, to set at liberty them that are bruised”, we appeal to the men of Frederick County to prohibit the traffic in liquor within
the borders of this county.
We have PREACHED earnestly against the saloon; we have PRAYED fervently for its destruction; we have SUFFERED with our people in
the devastation which it has wrought in their lives and in their homes; but all our sermons and prayers and compassion will not avail for the over
throw of the saloon unless you, the men of the county, will BY YOUR BALLOTS MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE IRON HAND OF PRO
HIBITIVE LAW TO DESTROY THE EVIL INSTITUTION. This we appeal to you to do on the Seventh day of November, in the year of our
Lord nineteen hundred and sixteen. In the great battle which is now waging, may no professed follower of our common Lord and Master be an
indifferent on-looker upon the struggle but every one a soldier in the ranks.
In the name of Him Whose cause, we are sincerely convinced, this is; in behalf of your suffering fellowmen, WE APPEAL TO YOU, THE
MEN OF FREDERICK COUNTY, TO CAST YOUR VOTE FOR THE PROHIBITION OF THE LIQUOR TRAFFIC.
