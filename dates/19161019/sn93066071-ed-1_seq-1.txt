tation committo of the Chamber of
Commerce turned down another solic

son claiming to have tuberculosis. The
committee voted to give him enough
money to get him to another town as
they thought it better than to have a
person with that disease soliciting
among our citizens. Liberal (Kas.)

The'Llberal people don't seem to go
strong for being their1 brother's keep
er." JIow about the people of tho
other town? Of course they had the
privilege of sending him on and so the
poor fellow would go down tho line.
It would seem some means should
be provided for the treatment of such
malignant cases, where those afflicted
were unable to care for themselves, in
stead of permitting them to solicit help
from door to door and tliUB jeopardize
tho health of others.
