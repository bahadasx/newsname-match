John Redmond Tells House of
Commons Treatment of Ire
land Is Galling and Full of
Menace.
SAYS ACT OF ASQUITH
BETRAYED IRELAND
Contrasts Ireland's Feeling of
Friendship for Allies at Be
ginning of War to Feeling
There Now.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Oct 18. The Irish
question was again brought to the .'
fore in the House of Commons to
day with the introduction by John
Redmond of a motion criticizing
the system of government of the
island. The motion reads:
"That the system of govern
irent at present maintained in
Ireland is inconsistent with the
principles wherefore the allies are
fighting in Europe and is or has
been, mainly responsible for the
recent unhappy events and for
present state of feeling in that
country.
Ireland Feels Betrayed
Mr. Redmond told the House of
Commons that the inclusion of Sir
Edward Carson, the Ulster Unionist
leader, in the coalition government
when the cabinet was reconstructed,
meant" to thousands of Irishmen the
belief that they had been betrayed.
He said he had prayed that "Premier
Asquith leave Ireland out of the coali
tion. The premier had refused and
the result was galling.
Mr. RedTond moved his resolution
in the presence of a crowded house.
Among those in the galleries were
Baron Wimborne, the lord lieutenant
of Ireland, Baron Charles Beresford,
Baron Pieri and Baron Stanfordshara,
King George's private secretary.
Situation Dangerous
The Irish leader said it was undeni
able that the situation In Ireland was
full of menace and danger and he con
trasted this state of affairs with the
genuine enthusiasm for the allies in
Ireland at the beginning of the war.
He proceeded to review the situation
in detail.
Mr. Redmond said the situation was
full of menace and danger; of menace
to the hopes and aspirations of Ire
land and to a good understanding be
tween Great Britain and Ireland to
the highest Interests of the empire at
the present moment.
"Nationalists Snubbed"
"My object is to allay, not to in
flame feeling. I do not want to make
a party speech and accordingly start
my survey with the outbreak of the
war.
"From the very first the efforts of
the Nat'onalist leaders were thwarted
and snubbed and, looking back, I am
nmzed at the success which, under
the circumstances, attended their ef
forts. Thirty thousand nationalist
volunteers had enlisted and if It had
not been for distrust of Ireland In the
early phases of the war the number
of volunteers would have been trebled.
Promise Of Army Unkept
The promise made by Premier As
quth as to the creation of an Irish ar
my corps also never had been acceded
to, he commented.
The difficult task or the nationalists
to popularize the army had been sys
tematically thwarted. Mr. Redmond
continued. The new national univer
sity was not allowed to organize an
officers' training corps, while a num
ber of private schools had been grant
ed the privilege.
Changes were made but too late, he
declared. Taking each thing individ
ually he went on, the effect was small
but cumulatively the effect was enor
mous and the undoubted enthusiasm
at the beginning of the war began to
die away.
The Cause Of Rebellion
The final blow came in the forma
tion of the coalition government he
said. From that day, recruiting for
the army had diminished and recruit
ing of the Sinn Feiners had increased.
From that day things went from bad
to worse and finally came the rebel
lion. "I am profoundly convinced that If

CARRANZA GETS
LAST CHANGE
TO CATCH
VILLA
In View of His New Resolu
tion to Run Down Bandit,
U. S. Commissioners Tell
Him to "Show Them".
(By Review Leased Wire)
ATLANTIC CITY, N. J.. Oct 18.
Supplemental assurances from Gener
al Carranza that he is beginning a
new and vigorous campaign against
Villa were received today by his rep
resentative on the Mexican-American
joint commission. The head of the de
facto Mexican government asserted all
available troops would be used in the
pursuit of the bandits.
The American commissioners re
viewed at the joint session a careful
ly prepared statement of the Mex-ican
claiTS as to conditions as well as pro
posals for restoration and mainten
ance of peace along the frontier. This
statement also included arguments
designed to show why the American
troops should be withdrawn from Chi
huahua. ,
Lasting Peace Demanded
The Mexicans insist they are capa
ble of driving Villa and other outlaws
from the border, but the American at
titude is that he must demonstrate
ability to do more than that T"hey
insist that control of the border must
be based on a reasonable indication
that the Mexican authorities are cap
able of maintaining effective govern
ment in the interior.
Carranza's Lost Chance
The willingness of Americans not
to urge compliance with their sugges
tions at this time is due to a hope
that General Carranza may be able to
direct a successful warfare against
Villa.
Troops Not For Chase
It was learned today that the troops
sent northward yesterday were not
i intended for the campaign against Vil
la but to relieve troops at Agua Cal
ientes and Zacaecas, who in turn will
be sent north to Torreon to relieve
others that would be sent into the
hills in search of Villa.

( estimate the damage caused by the
j flames, which were fought for four
hours by two fire boats and several
fire companies The blaze was con

LONDON, Oct 18. The Rumanians
have been successful, at least tempor
arily, in stopping the advance of the
Teutonic allies all along their border.
At no point along the line does either
Berlin or Vienna claim fresh success
es against the Rumanians, while tbe
Bucharest war office asserts that the
troops of King Ferdinand at various
points have repulsed the attacks of
the Teutonic allies, inflicting heavy
losses on them and capturing numbers
of theirofficers and men.
Violent fighting is still in progress
in Galicia, where on the Narayuvka
front the Bavarians have stormed a
Russian position and captured 350
men and 12 machine guns.
Both north and south of the Somme
the French troops have made fresh
gains. The village of Sailly-Saillisel
Is now entirely in their hands and
the Germans have been driven out of

hand, shaking hands with the other.

Hughes Promises
To Maintain U. S.
Rights Anywhere
(By Review Leased Wire)
KALAMAZOO. Mich., Oct 18.
Charles E. Hughes told an audience
in the armory here tonight that a vote
for him, far from being a vote for
war, meant a vote for the maintenance
of American rights and that when
i Americans went abitmd lawfully to
further American enterprise, they
should go with the "backing of the
I American government"
The nominee assailed the admin
istration for its foreign policy, for its
claim that it had aided business by
its Underwood tariff, for alleged fall-
i ure to observe the merit system in
making appointments, and for extrav
j agance. He declared the present pro
sperity tr the countrv is temporary
and due to the European war. The
federal reserve bill, be explained,
"giving credit where credit was due"
was largely the result of the support
of the Republican monetary commis
sion and contained "defects which
should be removed."

CHICAGO. Oct. 18. A heaping dish
of ice cream and some lemonade was
all that Sidney Hatch of Chicago, a
veteran amateur marathon runner,
