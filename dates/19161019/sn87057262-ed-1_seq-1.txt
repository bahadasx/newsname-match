Boisterous Welcomes and Noisy

[By J. P. Toder, United Press Staff
Correspondent.]
ABOARD ROOSEVELT TRAIN,
ST. LOUIS, Mo., Oct. 19.—With the
Kentucky mountain district and Its
eventful day behind him, Colonel
Roosevelt Is speeding across Missouri
and Kansas today to the scenes of
hus "short grass" range riding days.
While the colonel ostensibly is out
to make votes lor Hughes, republican
candidate he does not Intend to
spend all his time playing politics
while in Phoenix, Arizona, and Albu
querque, N. M., where he speaks Sat
urday and Monday, respectively. He
is looking forward to meeting, some
of his old plains pals. And if the
colonel keeps all the dates with gun
fighting cowboye who knew him in
the old ranch days who have wired
him to be sure and visit them, this
trip won't end when It Is expected to.
There are'two men, however, who
have wired Roosevelt they will meet
him either at Phoenix or at Albu
Qnwane. Old Seth Bollock who
used to sit bWrtntf tBr wloael at
political meetings with a pair of
loaded Colts In his hands, "to keep
the audience attentive."
The other Is Jim Davis, wnose left
ear "was bit off by a gentleman In
an argument"
Roosevelt admittedly is glad to get
out west. It has been four years
since he did any western traveling.
Then, too, his day yesterday was not
all beer and akittles. Besides the
wrecked freight train ahead of his
special, whl^h delayed him two
hours, the engine pulling his car,
broke down six times. The last tt.-xie
was at Livingston. There was a
crowd at the station calling for hircu
He was greeted with shouts of
"Woodrow Wilson, Woodrow Wilson,''
as he started to speak
The heckling plainly nettled the
colonel and unable to get well started
he shouted at the men, "that's right
shout for Woodrow Wilson if you're
too proud to fight and if the Lusi
tania sinking doesn't make your blood
corpuscles shout," and he went inside
to fpeak no more until he reached
Louisville for bis first big address of
the trip.
Excepting Louisville, Roosevelt got
his best reception at Corbin. Despite
a downpour, several thousand moun
tain folk who could get a job any
time suping as a mob in a Belas
coesque play, all but tore Roosevelt's
arm from his shoulder joints shaking
hands with him. The colonel said
that Corbin crowd was the most
picturesque he ever addressed. And
they wete. Some had left their moun
tain fastnesses for the first time in
three or four years and had walked
or ridden norseback or mules, mostly
mules, from ten to forty miles "to
see Teddy.
One grizzled old man, who was
obviously a stranger to 1916 civili
zation, persistently yelled, "where's
Teddy I want to see Teddy," until
finally Roosevelt interupted his
speech to say, "well my friend, take
a look. I'm Teddy." And then the
old chap refused to, let the colonel
contitaue his speech until he had*
gripped the colonel's hand.
The Louisville affair was something

[United Press Leaaed Wire Service.]
NORFOLK, Va., Oct 19.—A German
submarine, possibly the U-53, has
been sunk off Nantucket, acoording to
a message the British steamer North
Pacific claims to have received. The
North Pacific is taking on bunker
coal here today.
Although she arrived here Monday
night, from New Orleans, the North
Pacific did not report receiving the
message from what was said to be a
British cruiser, until today. The
message read:
"German submarine sunk east Nan
tucket."
Officers of the North Pacific said
the cruiser was laying off this coast.
[A London cable to the United
Press a few days ago said a sudden
reduction in insurance rates on trans
Atlantic shipping by Lloyds had
aroused speculation as to whether the
U-5S had been sunk, captured or had
returned to a German port, it being
believed that reduction Vas ordered
because Lloyds had received "inside"
information.]
