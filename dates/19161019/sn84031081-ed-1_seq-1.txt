lows Looks Good.
So far as local candidacies are con
cerned, A. A. Jones looks to lie the
one best del in his race for I'nited
States senator. It Is too early yet to
say that Mr. Jones is a sure winner,
I-ut he looks like one at this time.
This is partly! due to the fait that he
has hceii a part of 1'rcsldent Wilson's
administration, partly to the fact that
he Is known to he a man of wide ex
perience and ahility In nutlonal pol
itical affairs and partly to the posi

For it is becoming increasingly ev

St. Louis, Oct. is. Women wee
denied (apial rights with men in two
actions taken today by the House of
pishiips of the Protestant Fpisoopnl
general convention In session here.
A proposal to permit women to sit
as delegates in the general conven
tion was rejected, while a request
from the 111. Kev. Logan H. Hoots,
liishop of Hankow, to bo allowed to
admit women to membership in his
advisory council was denied. The
house suggesteil to the Kishop of Han
kow, it was suited, that he might
create an auxiliary council of women.
The proposal to give women equal
rights with men in tho convention was
tmimsnrefl hv III) bolt II. Gardiner, of
Gardiner, Me. A similar resolution
is now on the calendar of tho House
of Deputies, and, it was pointed out,
today's action in the upper house does
not preclude Its being discussed in
the lower body. Since concurrence of
the two houses Is necessary, in the
event that the House of Deputies
should approve t Ii u proposal, it would
go to the House of F.i.shops for recon
sideration. Would Amend Decalogue.
Tho House of Hishops, which also
considered changes recommended In
the communion service by the com
mission on the book of common
, raver, will suggest in its report to
the' House of Deputies that the ten
commandments be printed In the
prayer book in both their shortened
form and in their full form, and that
clergymen be given optional use of
cither in the service, it was said. The
commission had recommended that
five of the commandments l" li"H
ened as read in the communion serv
ice by the elimination of the reasons.
Ff forts to have the prayer of George
Washington, uttered upon the occa
sion of his laying down the supreme
command of the federal armies,
adapted and substituted for the pres
ent prayer "for our country" in the
book of common prayer, were Inaug
urated in the House of Deputies by
Poland S Morris, of Philadelphia. Mi.
Morris introduced a resolution which
resulted in a prayer, which had been
recommended by the commission on
the praver book, being recommitted to
