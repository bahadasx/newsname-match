NUMBER 42
. 60c AND WORTH IT
Some people urge that the Herald
is high at 50c a year, hut such Is not
the case. We do not know of any oth
er paper in the state as large as the
Herald that costs less than $1.00.
When you stop to think that every
thing the editor has to buy is high
and going higher, you cannot com
plain of 50c for your local paper. With
wheat around $1.50, old corn $1.00,
hogs 10c, eggs 30c, and so on no far
mer can rightly claim the Herald is
aigh at 50c. The Increased cost of
paper, ink, and other printer's sup
plies made it necessary to raise the
price of the Herald. Don't complain,
but come on with your subscriptions.

Do not allow your eyes to undergo risks that may

Healthy eyes often give trouble in reading, sewing, etc.
A large per cent of all headaches are caused from eye
