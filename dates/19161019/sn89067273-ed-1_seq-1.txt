THE SANTA FE
HAS SOME PLANS
Want to Get Into Bt. Louis Tenta
tive Hrlieme to Build Joint Road
From Carrollton to Mexico.
The metropolitan papers first of
the week contained the following
dispatch:
Chicago, 111., Oct. 14. Plans of
the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe
Railroad to enter St. Louis from the
west, tentatively announced recent
ly, may soon reach a definite stage.
Santa Fe officials admit they are
anxious to get into St. Louis to com
pote for the westbound passenger
and freight traffic, but it is contend
ed that plans for extending the line
into St. Louis as yet are vague and
that negotiations looking to the ex
tension up to this time have been
conducted informally.
The only plan thus far considered
calls for Joint action with the Chica
go, Burlington & Qutncy Railroad.
The Burlington has a line from St.
Louis west to Mexico, Mo. All its
trains are handled from Mexico into
Kansas City via the Chicago & Alton
tracks south of the Missouri River.
.This arrangement is said to be
unsatisfactory and the Santa Fe is
discusising plans which would call for
the construction of a track between
Carrollton, Mo., and Mexico, Mo., the
new . track to be used jointly by the
Santa Fe and the Burlington.
All conferences relative to the
proposed Santa Fe entry into the St.
Louis field have been conducted be
tween W. D. Storey, Santa Fe vice
president in charge of operation, and
II. E. Byram, the operating head of
the Burlington. Neither will admit that
the discussions have reached a defi
nite stage. Both admit, however,
that the subject has been discussed.
The Santa Fe ruus northeast from
Kansas City to Carrollton and thence
direct to Chicago. From Carrollton to
Mexico, the western terminus of the
Burlington-owned track, is only 95
miles, so that the project does not
call for the construction of any great
lenght of track.
Because of its western facilities
the Santa Fe would make a formida
ble competitor in the St. Louis field,
where it could offer shippers excep
tional facilities in movilg shipments
west and southwest. As the situa-
tion now stands, the Santa Fe ac
cepts at Kansas City for the West
haul a goodly percentage of west-
hmmH frotcrht nrtrtnfltlnfi' In St T.nilis. i
. - , IT I
Under a decision of the United
States Supreme Court any railroad
entering St. Louis has the right to
use the facilities of the Terminal
Railroad Association of St. Louis, on
a .v.ntal basis. Therefore it would
be unnecessary for the Santa Fe to
I build a depot or establish yards in
St. Louis.

the figure tears came to the eyes.
Another figure was was the face of
an American Indian, a creation al-
most as wonderful as the first. Last

lion.

Missouri in 1838 from Weymouth,
Mass. These parents with their chil

settled in Monroe County within a
quarter-mile of the present site of
Strother. A brother of Mrs. Zaugg,

MR. RKITT HAS A WORD.
Ai.ifien Timely SuKK"tin" to The
Corn Carnival Management The
Shows Were an Affront to tlie
Farmers.
Editor Message:
Dear Sir: Well. the. Fall Festivi
ties In Mexico are over for this year.
I feel that a few comni9nts may be
in order and a little just criticism
may lead to a better show next year.
First of all, I want to commend the
management for the very convenient
and roomy accommodations they pro
vided for the display of farm prod
ucts and the courteous treatment ac
corded exhibitors. It is a pity that
more of the space provided was not
occupied.
It is with a view to securing a
better response from the farmers
next year that I write these lines.
I wish to suggest a few ideas to the
management which, I think, if
adopted would lead to a more lively
interest on the part of the farmers.
The exhibits this fall were very
good, I thought, but not numerous
enough to make a really interesting
contest in most classes.
This Is partly due to a certain feel
ing among the farmers, over which
the managers of the Fair had no
control, that Is, the dread some peo
ple have of deing defeated. Most any
one will say, "Oh, yes. I would make
an exhibit If I knew I would win but
I don't want to be defeated."
Now that Is the wrong idea. If yon
have a good article don't be afraid to
show it, even if someone else does
show a little better one. If you show
a good article the fact that someone
shows a better one does not make
yours worse. On the other hand, If
you show a poor article and no one
shows a good one you will get the
premium, but It does not make your
premium any better. In other words
it is more to your credit to show a
really good article and have It out
classed by something still better thai!
to show a poor article and have it
win because there Is nothing good
shown.
I have shown live stork and farm
products in several different shows,
both in Missouri and Illinois and I
always went away with some win
nings and some defeats and I never
left but one fair feeling the least bit
sore and that was the fall of 1915,
when we had such a good hog show
at the Mexico Fair and the Associa
tion laid down on the whole bunch
of hog and sheep men and refused to
pay us any money at all because the
heavy rain prevented any attendance
that day. I never will think that was
right. That same rain damaged my
wheat and oat crop to the extent of
several hundred dollars but those to
whom I had promised money did not
cancel the obligation because of my
'osses.
I must return to my subject and
tell the managers of the Fall Festlvl
tlse how I think they might help mat
ters another year.
First, they might have the ribbons
tied early In the week so that visit
ors could see which articles ranked
highest and study just why they
ranked highest. A very few of the
visitors at Inst week'B show got to
see which articles were adjudged
best.
Another reason for thu farmers'
lack of interest, I think, was the car
nival company that was there. I am
not going to abuse those people, or
even say they had no right there,
but I do think their presence was a
detriment to the corn show'.
I believe that when the country
people learned they were to be an
noyed by the same old bunch of tent
shows and catch-penny games of
chance that were here last year they
became disgusted and lost interest.
You called it "Farmers' Week,"
and invited us to town to enjoy a va
cation, and we did not like to have
those people, with whom we have
nothing In common, pushing their
wares under our noses with such an
noying persistence. I believe most
of the farmers have a higher con
ception -than that, of what consti
tutes hlgh-classv entertainment. Tbey
consider It as an affront to their In
telligence to have that class of thing
brought to town for their entertain
ment. '
If yon douht that the farmers feel
as 1 say, just go 011 tho streets or to
the Hitch-lot and Interview them on
the subject. 1 think you will be con
vlueed.
Some have said it was a scheme
of the merchants to draw the people
to towu to spend their money, but I
TOMMIE TOM KINS'
WOODCRAFT STORY.
A Dream Almost Plays "Hookey"
From School Bro. Bull Frog Hit
In the Eye, Han Tommie Arrested.
By L. Roy Ferris.
Now, honest to goodness, Tommie
wasn't a bad boy. In fact, he was
just so kind and thoughtful, as a
rule, that everybody loved him. But
the mothers of all the little boys
would say: "Johnnie, try and be
nice, like Mrs. Tomkins' little Ton
mie;" or, "Willie, I wish you were
more like Tommie Tomkins."
So you see when a fellow like
Tommie forgets and does something
wrong it is just as bad as If you
were to do something you would be
ashamed for little sister to hear.
Well, I hate to tell you about It,
but If you will promise not to let It
cause you to disobey mother when
she says, "Freddy, bring me a bas
ket of chips" you will jump to the
task quickly, just as tho you were
playing foot ball, I will tell you.One
day Tommie started for school. He had
reached the litle grove of trees just
this side of the school house. It may
have been the bairds that sang so
sweetly, for Robin Red Breast had
shed the worn-out feathers In his
wings and tail and was telling the
Brown Thrush in song about the
nice family of four Mrs. Robin and
he had reared. How he had fooled
PuBsy Cat by building a nest right
before her eyes, so she could see.
But when she was taking a nap he
had built one In another tree, where
Pussy's sharp eves could not find.
Pussy had watched the wrong nest
for the darlings. How he would
soon lake his long flight down Soi'th,
a trip that no one but birds and
rich folks can afford to take each
year, down where the orange blooms
look like the ones Tommie's sister
wore when she was married.
So you see It wasn't altogether
Tommie's fault when he turned to
'the left Instead of the right, crossed
the log across the creek, and found
himself at the old Swimming Hole
where the giant willow hangs over
the creek and the roots form a dandy
good seat to sit upon while a fellow
pulls off his shoes and stockings
Tommie leaned against the willow
tree, and would no doubt have gone
to sleep had not Brother Bull Frog
have never charged them with such
a scheme. I believe it is done in a
better spirit than (hat. I believe tae
leading men In the different cities
finance and support something of
this kind every fall because they re
alize that the world must be aud will
be amused. But if they do hold
these festivities for the purpose
named, they surely are making a
mistake, by bringing in this bunch
of showmen and venders. They are
only offering to those who are fool
ish enough to patronize those peop'o
a chance to spend their money with
an out-of-town concern.
Almost everything they offer for
sale or barter Is offered In direct
competition with some enterprise In
Mexico. All their refreshments and
confections are easily duplicated in
the restaurants and cafes of Mexico;
all their trinkets and notions may be
found in the Mexico shops end stores
and even their shows are In competi
tion with the Mexico Play-housei,
tho I will venture the opinion that
the entertainment to be found within
their tents Is on a lower plane than
Is offered at the regular play-houses
of Mexico.
I just want to ask the City Dads of
Mexico where Is the consistency of,
trying to put down gambling In Mex-
ico and putting the city to the ex-
penso of arresting aud prosecuting

stuck his head up thru the green
cunr of the creek and winked at
Tommie. It Is bad enough to have
Brother Yellow Hammer pound on
the tree right over a fellow's head,
and pretending he Is hunting worms,
and every now and then give a
screech that sounds like he raid,
"Shame, shame". But when a frog
actually winks at a fellow, it was
more than Tommie could stand, and
grabbed a rock he shied It at Bro.
Frog, and It looked like the rock had
found Its mark.
"There Is little Tommie Tompkins,"
remarked Brother Coon to Brother
Habl.it as they came to the creek
for a drink.
"Why. bleps my heart," said
Red Squirrel, "Tommie, what
are you doing out of school?"
"Why, you see. Red Squirrel," be
gan Tommie, "you see I wasn't feel
ing well and, and" he began to
hunt for an excuse, like a boy hunts
for his knife In the grass. "You
see, I. well, to tell you the truth. 1
am tired of school."
"That is no excuse, Tommie,. In
the first place, do you suppose you
grow more tired than your teacher
who has to deal with a score or more
all day long, and after school while
you are rolling hoops and playing
ball his work continues, and while
you are aBleep in your little bed and
Dr. Owl is catching mice in the yard
under your window, your teacher is
sitting up working out many ways
to teach you things that will help
you to make a living when you have
to take care of mother in case your
dad should lof, his health."
Just then Blue Jay came scream
ing along, talking so excitedly, as
they always do.
"Why, look there," says Jay, "look.
Tommie Tomkins is running away
frexn school."
"And he hit me in the eye," added
Bull Frog."
"Let's try him," said Terrapin,
"before a jury of six and see If he
is guilty."
Dr. Owl was appointed Judge.
Brothers Rabbit, Terrapin, Muskrat,
Coon, Squirrel and Sister Possum
were chosen to act as jurors. Bull
Frog objected at first to having Sis-lei-
Possum serve. He said he
thought woman's work wits at home
in her hollow tree. But when Sister
Possum replied she guessed her
house was in as good order as any
fellow's mud-bank,, who never had a
