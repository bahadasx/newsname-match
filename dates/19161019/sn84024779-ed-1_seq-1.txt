REDUCING ACCIDENTS.
AT QRADE CROSSINGS
That grade crossings accidents
caused by automobilists crossing
ahead of passenger trains, may bo
reduced to a minimum the North
ern Pacific railway has started a
campaign in stabes through which
it operates. Under the caption,
"a word of caution to motorists,"
printed circulars embodying ways
and means for the avoidance of
such collisions have beeu sent to
all secretaries of state in the
Northwest with' the request that
these be distributed when new lie
ense plates -are sent out.
"With the number of automobi
les coming into use rapidly in
creasing it cannot be too strongly
emphasized that caution should
be observed by drivers when ap
proaching grade crossings," says
the circular '.'Daily reports show
accidents that could have been
averted had the driver of the mo
tor car'stopped, looked and lis
tened before attempting to cross
ahead of an approaching train."
"Government statistics show
the number of-persons killed a.vl
injured in the United States at
grade crossings 'to be as follows:
During 1914. 1147 persons killed
2935 injured, during 1915, 997
persons killed, 28 98 injured. The
reduction in casualties during
1915 as compared with the pre
vious \ar
are
due to warning
notices posted by railway com
panies and aulonubile clubs who
are endeavoring to provide effec
tive means for eliminating the
hazard as mush as possible.
"But the real measures of avoid
ing such accidents are to be fou.id
in the care observed by individual
drivers, themselves- Let your
slogan be—STOP, LOOK LISTEN.
"Drivers owe'this to themselves
and! to the passengers riding in
their automobiles. They hold as
great a responsibility toward their
families and friends as do the en
gineers of rapidly moving passen
ger trains to the patrons whose
destines, they are scharged with.
All the signs, notices, bells,
whistles, gates and flagmen hire
to protect the public are of no av
ail unless they can have the co
operation of the motorists.
"Observations have been made
to record the care shown by au
tomobile drivers and in 35,000 in
stances the following results
were noted: 53 per cent looked
•neither way before passing over
a grade crossing 8 per cent look
ed one way only and 174 motor
car drivers, "about half of oneper
cent" actually stopped their mach
ines beofer proceeding to pass
over the crossing. These figures
show that few men of undoubted
intelligence display the necessary
caution that may save their live*
limbs and property, by smjply
waiting a moment or two to allow
the train to pass.
"Trains have no choice of
routes they must run on the rails
and their patrons require that
they be on time, if possible. On
the contrary, motor car drivers
can choose their own routes and
the occupants of such machines
usually are not pressed for tini'!.
"If automobile drivers would
make it a habit to associate the
sight of a grade crossing and its
adivance notices with the sight of
a traffic policeman, and contrtl
their machines acordingly, grade
crossing accidents would cease.
No man is immune to the con
stantly growing use of the auto
mobile.
"Trains moving at, speeds from
25 to 40 mites an hour can, undei
ordinary conditions, stop in about
1,200 feet. Motor cars running
at the same speed can be stooped
in about 30 fret- The train often
weighs as much as 3,000 tons
while the automobile's weight
rarely exceeds two tons. It can be
readily seen- therefore, that th
greater weight, once under way, i--1casion,
much harder to stop. Every
motoristis should himself adopt a
policy carefulness that will
render him immuie from such
collisions."
LABOR REQUIRED IN
IN GROWING WHEAT
It requires 12 1-3 hours of hu
man labor and 30 hours of horse
labor to produce an acre of wheat
in Minnesota. These figures
were secured in an investigation
carried out during the year 1910
12, under the direction of Thomas
-Cooper, then with the Minnesota
Experiment Station, but now dir
ector of. the North Dakota Ex
periment Station.
If the yield was 12 1-3 bushels
per acre each bushel would re
quire one 'im of human labor
aed nearly -J 1-2 hours of horse
labor while if the yield were 2 5
2-3 bushels only about half as
much labor would required pu

WHAT LIFE" THINKS
OP PRES. WILSON
Mis Ida Tarbell says Mr. Wil
son is our greatest progressive
.and has proved his fitness to lead
the cause of progressive civiliza
tion.
Life" ays "Miss Tarbell is
right. I,nee tide tally "Life"
says some nice things about Mi.
Wilson right off its own bat- Its
editorial in part follows:
Miss Ida Tarbell has come out
for Wilson and Clifford Pinchol
has come out against him.
Again for Wilson both ways.
The truth is that Mr. Wilson
comes more and more under sus
picion of being the greatest Anier
ican progressive since Thomas
Jefferson. Jefferson was a ex
ceedingly clever man, especially
in the use of language and he was
out to boat the rich. Mr. Wilson
gives more and more the impres
sion of being out on the same
errand. Whenever there'conies a
choice of courses, as lately in the
threatened railroad' strike, he
'shows himself the same man who
was president of Princeton and
at outs with most of th. nobility
and gentry on his board of trust
ees. He is an astute, formidable
!person, driven all the time by an
innate nnd sleepless indisposi
tion to knuckle down to the pow
er of money or anyone that,stands
jon if.
The. ritli. as representatives of
the vested interests, are always
instinctively obstacles to political
progress. They are beneliearies
of the existing order and don't
want it all mussed up. Also they
have a say about the conduct of
life and he' management of aff
airs and they don't lose it. The
only power talit can stand up
against theirs and! keep their
grip on the human windpipe rea
sonably loose it the power of the
people- Acordingly, ambitious
spirits are always reaching out to
grasp and use the power of the
people.
That is the way of the world
so humau life goes on. Jef
ferson fought the federalists in
cluding most of the rich and re
spectable people in the country.
Jackson^ fought the United
States bank Lincolin fought the
slave-holding aristocracy and all
its allies Roosevelt fought—here
ancf there—the trusts, the rail
roads. the bankers, off and on- but
Roosevelt is an aristocrat and h&s
compassionate bowels for nis
jown kind.
But Wilson is not an aristocrat
He is a Presbyterian professor.
He fought acording to his lights,
against the exploitation of the
bodies and energies, of the com
mon. ocople to defend t"'« in
terest's and investments of the
prosperous. At the start he
would not fight in Mexico to de
fend American investors he would
not take sides with Rockefeller in
the Colorado strike he helped re
duce the tariff he alleviated the
domination of the money trust.
he would not get. into the war,
even after the Lusitania though
he did! risk doing so, and though
all 'society" wanted to get in
and he would not side with the
railroads against the brother
.hoods.
Mr. Wison is a kind of presi
dential monogoose. The ques
tion about him is not whether he
is pretty or has affectionate and
endearing ways, but a question of
snakes how many hoty big-
This man is for the mass of
the people'. He really is a great
democrat. He is a good hand to
nip the tariff cobra, the banking
adder, the railroad boa-constrict
or when this is necessary. It is
his nature to tight these creat
ures. It was not Roosevelt's
nature to fight them. He could
slash around among them on oc
but he enjoyed their so
ciety. His notion of government
was always government by arist
ocracy.
Miss Tarbell is right. Mr. Wil
son is a real progressive with th«t
necessary bite, the indispensable
wiles, and a remrakable gift of
public discourse.
government is a sad affair- and
being president is a sau duty
which someone must undertake.
j.Nobody continues very long lo
[make a goodt.job of it. but othr
things being equal a man with
four years' experience at it ought
to do rather letter I ban a gree.i
hand-
Besides this, says Joseph 11.
Choafe, Candidate Hughes' old
corporation lawr partner, Justice
Hughes has never had any ex
perience in foreign affairs whieh
now most critically involve our
inational ttonor and safety- and.
what is more, no man knows what
it is views are on this or any other
of th" leading questions which
now agitate the people of lhe
t'nileil Slates.

MARKET DAY
The autumn months appear lo
have been decided on in most
sections of North Dakota as the
proper time for "market days."
The Market Day, as the plans are
worked out in most communities,
have some of the features of the
eastern fall fair which has b$»n
so popular in the past. The
productive season of the yflar is
over. The crops have beer,
harvested .The products of the
field are now available for inspec

characterized by exhibits of
farm products in greater number

made for the sale and exchange of
articles of all kinds, old and new,
