Athens Is Scene of Anti-Ally

; Urges Leaders Not to Stir
Up Violence ia the Crowds
Athens, Oct 11 (Delayed). Oreek
troopa are In complete control of the
situation here today, anti-ally mobs
are being dispersed and tor the time
being the possibilities of a serious
clash between civlllons and French
marine seem to have been averted.
The anti-ally leader, however, are
continuing their attempt to organ
ise demonstration, and the crisis la
by no means past. It la understood
that King Constantino, following con
clash between civilian and French
ministers, sent personal appeals to
the most prominent of his supporters,
urging them not to stir up the Athens
crowds to acts of violence.
The collapse of reports that a
United Stales fleet was approaching
Piraeus to Intervene disheartened the
civlliana and baa helped restore or
der. Newspaper extras were circu
lated about the city by the anti-ally
leaders reporting that American war
ships would arrive within a tew hours
to aee that Greek neutrality waa not
violated by the allies. These reports
greatly encouraged the mobs, thous
ands of Greeks actually believing
that they would aoon be Joined by
American marines.
"It Is with Joy that we hear of
the approaching arrival of the great
American fleet," said one of the news
papers circulated by the royalists.
"It brings relief In the midst of our
torments. America, resents the sor
rows of the Oreek people and doubt
less will proclaim her reproof in a
voice that will resound across the
sea."
After hia conference with the Brit
ish minister, KlnsfConstantlne seem
ed disposed to meet all the demands
of the allies, though no authoritative
statement haa been Issued.
The most severe military measure
are now In force to prevent trouble.
The cabinet met today and, It la
reported, dratted a protest to the
allies against , the arrest of Oreek
members of the reservist lesgue by
Frenoh marine last night. A crowd
of reservist leaguers hissed a patrol
of marines who dispersed them at the
point of the bayonet. Oreek troops
witnessed the arrest, but did not In
terfere.
