'Passes on Road Case.
The Court pf Appeals has pass
edoa,vthe: validity of the Road
Copiirtission Ju Powell county
wheroby it fias rnled that no
Commission can be-had in this
county to handle the bond money
because the names of such Com
missioners .were not advertised
fifteen days beforo the eleption.
This puts the road situation in
Pfiwell county just where it was
April ll,J0l6--the day after the
election was' held. The matter
will now go back into the hands
of the magistrates and they will
improve the roads along the line
of their pledge to the people be
fore the vote on the bonds was
taken.
This' doesn't mean that there
should be a chill or any serious
setback iu building roads in the
oounty. The county has $1,800
for roads in the treasury from
last year's levy and it will have
twice this amount this. year be
sides the lOcentsfor general road
purposes' and 15 cents for bridge
purposes. This as a nucleus fund
can make a nice little'starter for
permanent improvements;
There is one stretch of road all
agree upon, both, as to location
and importance. That piece, of
road is from the Clark county
line to Waltersville. The people
alike in all part? of the county
use this road about the same.
