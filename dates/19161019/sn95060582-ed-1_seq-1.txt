A QUIET WEDDING -
Miss Elizabeth F. Thomas was
united in wedlock Saturday at 2
o'clock to Mr. Lionel D. Waite at
the home of the bride in St.
Johns by Pres. David K. Udall
of the L. D. S. Church, in the
presence of a few -friends and
relatives.
After the ceremony, which was
very impressive, the guests sat
down to a bounteous feast pre
pared for the occasion by loving
hands.
The bride is a daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Isaac Thomas and the
groom is a son of J. W. Waite.
The newly-weds will make their
home in St. Johns and they have
the best wishes of all their rela
tives and friends for a prosper
ous, happy life.
Denver Men Here.
Messers John F. Church and
A. M. Patten of Denver arrived
in the city Tuesday evening, they
are here for the express purpose
of looking into the matter of try
ing to start something in regards
to therebuilding of the Lyman
reservoir. It is the desire of
these gentlemen to have the re
construction begin this winter,
but what plans will be made are
not, as yet, definitely known.
The people of St. Johns are also
anxiously awaitinjfxleve! meits
and all those holding stock in the
company are ready and anxious
to begin operation, so with a
united effort there is no reason
why the work of rebuilding
should not commence in the very
near future.
Bonds?
Yes of Course bonds,
If not, why not bond 3?
All deep thinking people will
vote bond yes.

ANOTHER DANCE
Were you there?
Yes everybody was present.
The big dance given by Mr. and
Mrs. E. I. Whiting Monday even
ing at theirnew store was attend
ed by a large crowd and the event
was one that will long be remem
bered by the people of St. Johns
and vicinity as there were many
in attendance from the surround
ing towns.
The Apache Theater Orchestra
furnished the music and did them
selves proud.
At the early hour the dance
commenced and continued- until
all were content to go home and
seek rest for the remaining few
hours of the night.
The hall was large enough so
that all could dance to their
hearts content without being in
terfered with. Some are of the
opinion that Mr. Whiting would
do well to use it as a dance hall
instead of a store building.
Mr. and Mrs. Whiting are to be
congratulated upon the excellent
manner in which they conducted
the affair and all join in wishing
them success in their future busi
ness. Mr. and Mrs. Thos. Neal have cone to their ranch
near the Whiting saw mill to dig their potatoes.
Chas. P. Anderson returned Tuesday from Salt
Lake City, Utah where h went to attend the L.D.
S. conference which convened there during the
first part of the month. He reports a pleasant
trip and an excellent conference. While in Utah
he visited his old home at Grantsville and met
many old acquaintances.
COLUMBUS.
The story of the famous navi
gator will be vividly portrayed on
October 27th at the school house;
District No. 11, at 7:30 o'clock.
I want all the parents and
friends of the children in my
room to be there as I believe this
to be the best production I bave
yet given, If I give your child
a part and you fail to come to see
how it enjoys the work, you fail
to do your duty to the child and
offend me by your lack of appre
ciation for the extra labor I have
done.
