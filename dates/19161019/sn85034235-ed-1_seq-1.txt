An Eye Test.
Most people believe that; they see the
same with both eyes. That this is,not
the case one can easily ednvince him
self by the following simple experi
ment: Cover one of the eyes with a
hand or bandage and let the experi
menter attempt to snuff out a candle
suddenly placed within a-few feet of
him. He will almost invariably miss
the flame, either overreaching, under
reaching or putting the fipgers too far
to the right or left of the flame. With
both eyes normal and open thé accom
modation for distance and direction is
instantaneous.
Both Satisfied.
"The best thing that, ever happened

NE thing that astonished me a
little. Abe," she went on,
"was that when Mr. Daniel
just now' said he thought
Howard did the shootln' you disputed
it with 'im—said he didn't do It."
"I didn't say It—I didn't say no seoh
thing!" Abe put his hands on either
side of his plate and stared at her
fiercely. "Thar you go with yore fool
notions. You couldn't hear what I said.
I—I jest said—said I thought the boy
—I didn't say he didn't do it Folks all
about say he done it Lawyers an'
judges an' witnesses say he's the one.
an' they know better 'n me. You'll go
tattlin' w'lth yore busy'tongue till—till
—well, you let the thing alone, that's
what you do! Let the law take its
course. lie was ready to bill 'im. He
armed hlsse'f fer that purpose. He had
no use for 'im. Howard knowed 'im.
like a lot o' other folks knowed 'im. for
the devil that be was with helpless, in
nocent young gals."
"That reminds me, Abe." Mrs. Ful
ton said, curiously. "I'm not dead sure,
but I thought I heard you mention poor
Susy's name to Mr. Daniel. I was sort
o' surprised to hear you do it. too. for
she was akin to yon, an' most folks
don't like to talk about seeb delicate
matters in the'r own blood. I've know
ed all along how' sorry you was fer
Susy; but I never brought It up. Pore,
pore gal!"
"Yes, I told Mr. Daniel about that,"
Abe faltered, after an awkward pause.
"He hadn't hoard o' tiiat particular
case, though he knowed all about sev
eral others."
■'Yon are powerful tetchy, Abe, dar
Iiu\" the woman went on gently. "I'd
talk plain to you. but you think a wo
man don't know enough to give advice
to a man. A woman ain't seeb a plumb
fool. Sometimes she feels a thing to be
risky an' unwise that n man passes
over as of no consequence."
"What are you drivin' at?" Abe de
manded. seriously.
"Oh. well, I don't believe in talkin'
too free to a man as good even as Ab
ner Daniel is supposed (o be," was the
half shrinking answer. "Risks is risks."
"Risks? What sort o' risks? Are you
plumb crazy, woman?"
"I knowed you'd tly off the handle."
she said appeasingly. "But I believe a
woman has as much right to use her
brain as a man has, an' I've been
tliinkin' about Mr. Daniel's long draw
ed out palaver.!'
"Long palaver?"
"Yes." she went on. more freely, for
his look and tone were more inviting
because more fraught with fear than
anger. "He's the keenest man In this
state by long odds. Abe. Folks say
that he makes the best hoss an' cattle
trades of anybody about lieré. Now.
my point is this'. Abe darlin': you
wouldn't want pore Susy's name fetch
ed up in-public now that the pore thing
is lyin' in a peaceful grave fur from
home. You wouldn't like to hear it on
everybody's tongue linked with that
human scab tiiat has got his just de
serfs, would you?"
"N-o. but what makes you think'*—"
"Why. I've got common sense, an
kin see a' Inch before my nose, tlmt'.s
all." site interrupted. "Abner Daniel
Is deffendln' on Howard to help 'im opt
with the paper he bought It is losin'
money ns it stands. Yon heard 'im say
so. Wejl. don't you know that he ain't
goin' to leave a stone unturned to set
Howard free? An' don't you see whnr
you come In?- Ho kin have you sum
moned to court an' put on the stand to
fell all you know agin Praia's churn
ter. Don't you see how that would stir
up sympathy an justify Howard In
killin' a man o' seek a stripe?"
Abe stared speechlessly. He stroked
his lips and chin with his big rough
hand and avoided her gaze.
■'Ah, I see you understand!" his wife
cried, exultantly. "You men tliinli
women bain't a grain o' sense, but we
ain't all fools. Ef Abner Daniel bad
been talkin' to me about Howard
never would have iot oir about Susy
yon bet I wouldn't. When a life's ut
stake folks will do anything that's
dirty an' low to save it. an' you hotter
watch Abner Daniel. Why. as little
as you may think of it, Howard an
him would shoulder the thing onto you
of they had half a chance. It is hard
er to convict a prominent man than a
pore friendless feller like you, Abe."
"Yen don't believe they would try a
—n thing like that, do you?" he cried.
"What wouldn't they try ef it offered
Howard, a chance of es-npe from the
scaffold? They'd even pay money to
git folks to testify ng'In" somebody e!
that they could throw the blame on
Let 'Im alone in the future. Abe. Dan
ici belongs to one set o' folks an' yon
an' me to another. We mustn't giv
'im a chance to fetch- that pore pal
name into it ef we kin help it. What
was it he was axin' you so close abou
— l mean when he axed so particula
about t lie last time you seed Crai
alive?"
"I don't know. I don't remember.
Fulton started suddenly.
"It seemed to me. Abe, as well as I
could hear, that he got you tangled up
little. First you said the last time
you laid eyes on Craig was here at the
pigpen, an' next you said it was at the
fence you was buiklin*. I knowed you
was wrong about the pigpen statement,
fer ef Craig had rid by here I would
have seed Mm. Besides, lie wouldn't
ride so fur out o' his way unless he
had some'n' powerful important to say.
You see, Abe. darlin', right thar you'd
be in danger, fer you are sort o' wishy
washy an' careless in yore statements.
Ef Daniel does summon you to testify
about Susy an' Craig you'll have to be
powerful careful, fer a sharp lawyer
will do his level best to mix you up.
an' when a'body is under oath on the
stand they have to know what they are
talkin' about. You remember how help
less you was wlieu you was convicted
that time."
Fulton rose clumsily to his feet. He
stepped down outside and moved across
the grass to the wash bench. Wonder
lug over his unexpected silence, his
wife followed, tiptoeing softly to his
side. The red light of the burning pine

out on the black forest In front of
them. She put her hand on his arm
and held it, but be said nothing. Sud
denly he started, uttered a gasp and
cried: —*---- **■ •
Look! What's that cornin' this way?
It's a man on a hoss! Great God—it's"—
'Taiu't nothin'," the woman said as
soothingly as if he were a child fright
ened by dreams. "It's jest yore fancy
I've been talkin' too much about"—
"It's thar! Tliar! Oh. he's cornin' to
me! God have mercy! Drive 'im off!''
'Don't be silly, Abe. sweetheart."
The woman put her arms around his
neck. "It ain't nothin' but yore fancy
I've seed sights out o' the common my
se'f. but that ain't nothin'. We've been
talkin' so much about killin' an' bang
in' an' the like that you are plum up

here I'll put up the things an' come
back."
Obeying her ns a child might and
trembling from head to foot, lie sat
down.' She left him and went in to her
work. She held a cup in fixed hands,
stared into the fire and cried:
"Oh. my Lord! Lord have mercy! 1

Cora Langbam greeted her mother
affectionately on the return of the lat
ter from a two day visit to Atlanta.
"How did you find the house?" Cora
asked indifferently.
"Oh. all right, but the grass has suf
■ferod In the front yard. It looks dry
and parched. 1 found out one particu
Inr thing that set my mind at rest"
"What w*s that, mother?"
"You knew, 1 guess." Mrs. Ijingham
replied. "Why. I found that we have
not been connected in the slightest
with that Howard Tinsley affair. Even
your father did not mention il. I de
termine;! to see if people were talking,
and found that not one word had been
said. You know, if there was any gos

chatL'd with lier fully an hour, and she
didn't' mention it. I let it worry me
entirely too much. Very few happened
to see the notice of Howard's visit to
us. Is there any fresh uews about
him?"
"Nothing particular." Cora answered
"Tlieu he hasn't owned up yet?"
"No. and from what some of Ills best
friends say he never will. Mother, yon
remember Mary Trumbley?"
"Yes. of course. What about her?"
"They say she is a most reinnrknbl
girl." Cora's eyes were now stealthily
probing her mother's face. "Frank
Reymond was telling me about her.
He can't talk of anything else. You
knew she went to work on Howard
paper, didn't you?"
"I think I heard you say somethin
aboutit. But what of that?"
"The papers all around, even the big
dallies, are saying her work is wonder
ful—simply wonderful. People here

are admiring it. I've just been readin
one of lier editorials. 1 can tell which

so sure now that Howard has not told
the truth all along. Ilis friends—bis
true girl friends—are sending him flow
ers and notes of encouragement, and
even strangers are writing him kind
hopeful letters."
"Well, that's all right." Mrs. Lang
ham said coldly. "Even if be is found
guilty at his trial it will be a comfort
to Mary to know that she did so much
for him."
"But he may not be found guilty. Iu

Mother, most persons think money is
an advantage in life. 1 begin to think
is a serious drawback. If Mary
Trumbley had been a rich society girl
an opportunity of this sort could not
have come to her. I'd rather live on a
farm at the foot of a mountain, as she
does, and be able to do what she is
doing than to marry a millionaire and
live in a mansion in New York or I»n
don."
"Oh, bosh!" Mrs. Langham sniffed
Of course it is good for her to have
such a talent, for that's all the pool
girl has. and she deserves something to
vary the monotony of lier hard life. II
I didn't think you had more sense than
to do so I'd be afraid you were actual
ly interested in Howard Tinsley.''
"Why, mother!" Cora's glance sank,
and her lips twitched. "Don't you
know he Is in love with Mary Trum
bley?" she faltered. "He couldn't help

recently. As for me. he hates me—

Mary Trumbley has stood, and such a
chance may never come to me now.
Cora suddenly covered her face with
her hands.
"Cora, dear, you alarm me—you real
ly do," said Mrs. Langham. "You
upset me frightfully," the mother
slowly said. "I see it all. It is this
trouble of Howard Tinsley's. You
ought never to have met sueli a man
as be. You are allowing your con
science to bother you in a silly, fanci
ful way. When you entertained him

your desire not to admit other callers
that you wanted him to yourself. You
had never acted so with any other
man. You were excited unduly. You
wanted to make a good impression,

"i'll tell you." Cora uncovered her
face and with piteous eyes stared
straight at her mother. "That very
visit separated me and him. forever.
He saw the sort of life I clung to. and
If—if lie had ever thought of marryin
me lie gave it up then. 1 saw it in his
face—in his strong, manly face. 1 read
his contempt for every bit of gaudy
display we made that day.
"He had been holding off; i thought
he was leaning to Mary Trumbley, and
I resorted to that contemptible snbter

"You are idealizing a very ordinary

"I den't believe lie is guilty." Cora
said sharply. "I don't care what Ham

CHAPTER XXIV.
Pleading For a Life.
FEW evenings later Abner Dan
iel was walking after supper
on the grass iu front of Triun
bley's house. It was bis usual
early bedtime, but be had no inclina
tion to sleep. Mary had been his com
panion for more than an hour, and they
had been talking of their work and
above all of Howard's trouble, but she
had gone into the bouse, and he was
facing the grim problem alone. Sud
denly at the bend of the road be saw
the blurred figure of a man come into
£iew, pause for a moment and then
move on toward him with what seem
ed to be an uncertain, hesitating step.
Then, looking more closely, Abner rec
ognized Abe Fulton. Seized by a sud
to
o'
o'
or
den desperate impulse toward fresh ac
tivity. Abner stepped to the gate and,
opening it. advanced boldly toward
Fulton.
With a low grunt of fear and sur
prise the latter turned and was about
flee the spot when Abner uttered a
soft, reassuring laugh. "Hub! I scared
you," he chuckled. "I didn't mean to,
Abe. I drapped my tobacco at the foot
that oak an' was down on my all
fours rootin' about in the grass like a
bog tryin' to find It. Which way are
you headed at this time o' night? Late
fer you to be out, ain't it?"
"I wasn't goin' nowliar," Abe replied
hesitatingly.
"At the blacksmith's shop in the edge
town this mornin' the feller that was
blowin' the bellows, Abe, said you'd
jest passed along an' axed cf he'd seed
me. Was It anything particular you
wanted?"
Fulton blinked helplessly.
"No, I—I didn't want nothin'," be
said haltingly. "Nothin' at all. I was
jest wonderin' ef* you'd passed along.
1—I"— Tha voice died away.
Abe looked toward the full moon and
stood stroking the bristling, week old
beard on bis chin.
'Oh, I'll bet you did want to see
me," Abner said. "You are Jest a little
back'ard an' slow to come to a thing.
Abe. I used to be that way myself till
politics, tradin' hosses, an' one thing
other learnt me that it wouldn't do."
The man offered no denial, and of
this Abner made a mental note.
"I did want to see you," be blurted
out. "1 bain't been right in my mind
here lately. Sometimes I don't know
what Pm sayin' or doin'. My wife has
noticed it an' called my attention to it
several times."
"Ah, lie is goin' to own up an' claim
mental unsoundness," Abner reflected,
while a sudden glow of hope suffused
him. "He's sharp enough to know that
it will strengthen his claim." Then
aloud to Fulton, be said: "A man ain't
accountable fer what be does wben
he's that way, Abe, especially ef he's
all keyed up In pity over somebody be
in' harmed or wronged—some helpless
person that be hated to see suffer."
Fulton seemed so much absorbed
over what he was now bent on saying
that Abner's words fell on closed ears.
"I was bavin' one o' my worst spells
t'other evenin' when you was out look
in' fer yo' hoss. I'd been feelin' so bad
that I drunk a lot o' whisky just 'fore
you come. I thought that would clear
up my mind, but I tuck too much. I
drunk mighty nigh a pint, all told. I
was Jest gittiu' under the influence of
it wben I was talkin' to you. an' after
you left I was plumb soaked. My wife
overheard the ramblin' way 1 was talk
in' to you. an' when I come in—or it
was the next mornin', when my mind
was clear—she told me—she told me
she had never heard anybody say seeb
ridiculous things in 'er life."
"Ridiculous?" Abner's heart sank in
sheer dismay over the unexpected stand
the man was taking. "Ridiculous? Did
you say ridiculous, Abe?"
"Yes: an' I've been tryin' to remem
ber what it was I did say that night.
I think, among other things, we talked
about—about"—
"Yes, we talked about Craig an' How
ard Tinsley," Abner went on fiercely,
for the course Fulton was taking had
upset one of his best hopes. "Y'ou said
you was sorry fer the boy—you said
he'd done you favors, an' you seemed
to think, though I didn't fully agree
with you at the time, that Howard
was tollin' the truth."
"I may have said it." Abe went on
insistently, keeping his desperate gaze
on a wheel cut rut in the road, which
he was nervously kicking with the toe
of his coarse shoe. "I don't git full
often, but when I do I slobber over an'
sometimes cry about the least thing.
My wife said 1 cried about Howard
wben I got to bed after you left that
night an' said lie was bein' treated
wuss'n a dog. That was odd, too, for 1
don't know a thing about the case. I
reckon noward is as nice as the gen
eral run o' boys, but everybody knows
he has a hot temper an' armed hisse'f
lin' wont lookin' fer his man."
"Yes. he has a hot temper." Abner
was speaking at. random in an effort to
get Ills bearings. Never before had he
felt his Ingenuity put to such a bewil
dering test, and his hope of rescuing
Howard was becoming less and less as
he realized the safe ground Fulton now
stood upon. Was it possible that the
wits of a man of this low type could
defeat his own?
"I'm goin' to quit drinkin', even fer
my health," Abe went on, the glare of
a half insane man in his eyes. "You
must 'a' thought I was a plumb idiot
that night, an' I must 'a' been actually
full o' liquor."
"I didn't smell It on you, Abe. I was
bothered about my boss an' the hard
work me an' Mary have on our hands
In the office. You can have no idea how
awful it is to "be in sech a tight place as
me'n her are in."
"I remember a little bit o' wliat 1
said—jest sort o' like a dream, you
know, Mr. Daniel. I think maybe I
talked about—about my cousin Susy
Thomas an' her trouble. Bein' out o'
my head that way an' thar bein' so
much talk about—about Craig's bad
reputation with women. I reckon 1 got
Ihe pore gal mixed up with him some
way in my silly mind. She did have
trouble like that, but a young feller 1
knowed about that used to run as
brakeman on the W. and A. road was
the one that was to blame. He desert
ed her all right enough, an' run away
somewhar. I—I must give the devil
bis due, an' Craig, with all that is said
agin 'Im, ortn't to be blamed with
with another feller's deeds."
"I see. I see." Abner said, helplessly
"But she did—you said, 1 believe, that
you got word back from Texas that the
pore gal died out thar."
There was just a hint of. hesitation
such as a witness on the stand in
court might sjfiow in the desire to make
an accurate statement, then:
I
I
in
"Yes; she died— sise did die out thar,
Mr. Daniel, but it was from weak lungs
—consumption. It was in her family.
She was always puny-like."
"Then the operation you mentioned?"
Abner suggested. "She didn't die from
that?"
Again Fulton deliberated beforo
speaking. Finally in response to -Mi
ner's steady stare he said: "I don't
know that thar was any operation, but
some folks that was in a position to
know said that the young feller did
give Susy some concoction or other
that wasn't good fer her an' may have
hurried the pore gal to 'or grave. I
don't know. I know, though, that I'm
goin' to let whisky alone hereafter. Mr.
Daniel. It won't do when it plumb up
sets a man like I was that night. I
didn't have any sense at all. For in
stance, you know, I couldn't recall ex
actly when it was that I last seed
Craig 'fore ho was shot, i made two
different statements, one on the heels
o' t'other. I said once that 1 was at
the new wire fence at Craig's an' then
at my pigpen at home, but now that
I'm plumb sober an' got all my senses
I remember that It was at my pigpen
tiiat I last seed 'lm."
"I see. I see," Abner said gently.
"An' I reckon it was to straighten out
all this that you was Inquirin' about
me at the blacksmith's shop, Abe?"
"Yes. I thought I'd git it straight ef
I run across you an' had a talk."
"An' that's what you was lookin' fer
me tonight fer?" Abner led him on gen
tly.
"Yes," Abe nodded. "I wanted you
to have a plumb straight tale. I didn't
see no use o' lettiu' you believe what
wasn't so."
Abner made no reply. Glancing a
few yards ahead, he saw his wagon
under a spreading beech at the road
side. and for some reason which he
failed to make known he moved to
ward it. It was as if he had forgotten
the presence of his companion. With
a slow look of uneasy wonder Fulton
followed.
"Yes, lots an' lots o' things p'lnt to
Howard," Abe went on, almost in a
tone of appeal. "I can't blame Mm,
though, Mr. Daniel, fer Craig cussed
Im to bis face several times, an' How
ard always was high strung an' easy
to git mad."
They reached the wagon, and Abner
put bis band on the detachable spring
seat "Git 'round t'other side, Abe, an'
he'p me down with It Pm goin' to
have a feller hanl some stove wood
from this mountain tomorrow, an' I
don't want Mm to take this seat along.
It fills up too much, considerin' that
he's to be paid by the load."
Abe obeyed. He went around to the
other side, and he and Abner lifted the
seat over the wagon pole and put it
ainst the trunk of the beech. "Lot's
set down awhile, Abe, I'm sorter tir
ed." Abner said, with n little yawn,
sinking upon the seat and crossing his
slim legs. "Set down—set down, Abe."
Like an automaton Fulton complied,
staring at the ground. Abner saw his
knees trembling under their ragged
coverings. Mile sight of the cowed des
perate creature touched his heart, and
a tone of real sympathy, that was not
without effect on its object, filled his *
voice when be next, spoke.
"This is a sad, sad old world, Abe."
be began. ''I've been in It a long time,
an' I bain't seed much else but trouble
on every hand. I wish I could be a
good man, but I can't always manage
it I'll feel better tonight, though, ef
I make a clean breast to you about
some'n' I done. You may think it is a
small matter, but it ain't to me. I
actually lied to you t'other night. I
intimated I thought Howard was guilty.
In tryin' to do a little good—in tryin'
to find some way to help that pore
stricken boy an' his heartbroken mam
my, I drapped into my old tricky way
talkin' that I acquired when I was
younger an' traded a lot with keen fel
lers that had no conscience an' killed
what little I had. The truth Is. Abe,
that I was so anxious to find out ef
you could throw any light on the mat
ter t'other night that I led out by
accusin' Howard mysc'f. I saw yon
was friendly to Mm. an' I knowed that
Vd set you to talkin', an' It dkl—you
know it did."
Fulton laid ills splaying hands on his
knees to steady them, but lie kept his
eyes averted. "I didn't know you was
foolin' me then. Mr. Daniel; but I did
after I thought It over." he said, hus
kily. 'Then I seed yore band, an' got
ready fer you. Ef you want the truth
you may have it hot from my box, Mr.
Daniel. I seed what you thought, but
you lmin't got n smidgen o' proof—not
a smidgen agin me. An' ef I am tryin'
to defend myse'f now it is because I've
got to. I know what you think, an'
that's enough fer me. I know you are
one o' the keenest men in the country,
but I ain't goin' to let you bully me.
Ef—ef you had any proof you would
throw the whole blame on me an' clear
yore man, but you haln't got no proof—
the proof all lies some'r's else."
"You arc right. I lialn't got no proof,
Abe," Daniel returned sadly.
Daniel paused a moment.
"Well, Abe," be continued, "Pm here
to say that I am convinced that folks
can't keep on doin' wrong, even ef they
try. The very laws o' the universe are
agin 1L Every day you pick up a paper
an' rend how some feller has toted
crime on his soul fer years an' years
an' finally come forward of his own
free will an' dumped it off in open con
fession. Abe. yore ma is dead--passed
on—hain't slie?"
"Yes," slowly drawled Fulton. "She
died wben I was a boy."
"She was a good woman, I'll be
bound, Abe. Wasn't she?"
"Yes."
"Do you know what I think she is.
Abe? She's some'r's whar God's light
is brighter 'n' it is here Who knows,
she may be able to come nigh you an'
throw her holy influence about yon?
Bein' more like God than she was here
