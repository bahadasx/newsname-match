Thrift Is Psreparediraes
ft
Financial strength, is to na
tions as important as milita
ry strength. No nation can
survive a war if it cannot
finance itself.
The man who fortifies him
self with an account in a
savings banK does more
than prepare himself he
contributes to the prepared-
ness of thd country.
Germany, unable to bor
row from other countries,
has been financed by the
thrift of her people, as this
thrift was expressed in ac
counts in savings banKs.
j A savings banK deposit helps the nation
and is indispensable to the individual.

PREPARE HIE
CHILDREN FOR
LATER YEARS
HERE js no more serious question for you to de
cide, Mr. and Mrs; Parent, than the kind of training
your children are to have. In many homes education an5
training depend upon how much the parents can afford to
spend.
What about Your Boy and Girl?
Will Willie hT to forego hia dreamt of being a eiyil engineer,
or will Mary be deprived of the musical training she lias been
looking forward to? Will they be compelled after school
years are passed to take their places with the underpaid men
and women, untrained, without a vocation?
Plan now, when they are young. Bank your money or better still, de
posit a little to their credit in this bank regularly, and when the time
comes there will be no necessary "aLimping" to start them off right.
