This was unwelcome news for the

severely recently to supply their
trade, even partially.
Beginning Oct. 1, firms rely uj
on beet sugar manufacturers to
supply them with "sweetenin "
It is understood that the supply
of cane sugar at New Orleans and
of beet sugar in the beet produc

Many retail grocers have be

THE MEXICAN PROBLEM
INHERITED FEOM G. O. P.
The Republican campaigners,
from the fault-finding Hughes
down to the humblest cross-roads
statesmen, have nothing to say!
of the' Mexican problem save
during ilson's administration.
They carefully ignore everything '
be?ilarch 4 -10 13, and '-one j
tLIrif non-comnnttal sentence
ccre.rg all they dare say of the
future if Hughes is elected.
.They never mention the hu
miliating incident of the Ameri
can citizen taking out a certifi
cate of registration from the
British consulate at the City of
Mexico to secure protection of
his property. But this happened
when Roosevelt, the Doughty,
was president in 1908.
They never refer to the letter
President Taft in 1911 wrote to
the governor of Arizona, who
had telegraphed him that unless
the government acted the people
of Douglass, Ariz would have to
vacate the town: "I cannot or
der the troops to pass the bor
der, but must ask you and the
local authorities, in case the dan
ger occurs again, to direct the
people of Douglass to place them
selves where bullets cannot
reach them." "

insr Datiently with Mexico, can
he find anything more cowardly

LEVEE WORK PROGRESSING.
A BOOM TO WEST END.
The Dixie Contracting Co. is
going right ahead with the build
ing of the levee protecting the
west end of town from periodi
cal over-flows from the Mississip
pi. Two work trains with full
crews are now on the job, and
with continued favorable weath
er, the work will likely be com
pleted right on time. The best
day's work ever done by the citi
zens of the west end was when
they signed up for the contribu
tion necessary to get this levee
built. Already property values
have received a stimulus and re
newed interest is being taken in
the up-building of that end of
town, which without a levee, was
destined to go to the bow-wows.
According to specifications, this
levee is to be considerably above
the government standard, there
fore no uneasiness should be felt
regarding security behind it
when completed. The new levee
will be a dandy; and the Men-
gel Box Co. is just about ready
to start on the enlargement work
on the old levee in theMengel
Yards, which forms a link in the
system now under construction.
The crest of the levee will be a-
bout eight feet higher than the
railroad track when finished.
A petition in bankniDtcy was
filed by George Lambert, dry
goods merchant in Union City,
Friday. He was represented by
Attorney George Gibbs, who es
timated that the stock would pay
about 30 cents on the dollar. Mr.
Lambert's largest creditor is his
brother, Hugh S. Lambert, of
Memphis.

CONGRESSMAN HARRISON
PREACHED DEMOCRACY.
Hon. Pat. Harrison, one of Mis
sissippi's able young congressmen
addressed the voters here last
Thursday night with a line f
go d, old time Democratic doc
trines, which was enjoyed by
Democrats, appreciated by Re
publicans and-Independents. He
presented the administration's
view of the labor question, the tar
iff, the Mexican jolicy, foreign
relations, etc, in a most able and.
convincing manner. He brought
out Mr. Hughes' record as Gov
ernor of New York, which is
certainly inconsistent with what
he is preaching today. Candidate
Hughes, when governor of New
Ycrk, vetoed the two cent rail
road bill and opposed the income
tax, which makes the rich bear
their proportional part of the bur
den of taxation, lie has always
arrayed himself against the com
mon people aud pandered to the
rich, and is now receiving his pay
in heavy campaign contributions
from swollen fortunes. Harrison
called attention to the fact that
Mr. Hughes Ls now advocating
an eight-hour work day, but he
opposes the law recently enacted
for that purpose by the Demo
crats (because the Democrats
passed it) and further that 71 Re
publicans in congress voted for the
act and only fifty-four opposed it.
He said the Mexican situation
was rotten when the Demo
crats came into power: if
the Republicans believed in a
different policy, they had the
opportunity to do something
while William Howard Taft was
at the bat and didn't do it. Of
course the Democrats have had
to deal with the European war
situation exclusively, and it does
seem, in view of the fact that
peace has been maintained
through some trying times, that
Pres. Wilson should be given cred
it for a patriotic and non-political
effort in keeping this coun
try out of war. Certainly no A- '
merican citizen wants to see this
country involved in the world
war regardless of his political
affiliations but CoL Roosevelt
f ranhly admitted that he would
have jumped right on Germany
when the Lusitania was tor-
pedoed if he had been president,
etc. - . -
Mr. Harrison analyized all the
principal issues, and was repeat
edly enchored.
The speaking occurred at the
Moose Club Rooms and these
were packed and jammed. Coun
ty Judge Stahr, with his usual
eloquence and well chosen re
marks, introduced the speaker.
