POTATOES, SPUDS,
MURPHIES,TUBERS
CALL THEM WHAT YOU LIKE
NUGGETS MIGHT FIT—WE
HAVE THEM HERE
Yield Above the Average—Price Soar
ing—Bright Prospects For the
Industry
3,700 BUSHELS. 16 ACRES
M. S. Phillips has harvested his
16 acre crop of potatoes on his
Muddy Valley farm, just north of
Williston, ana realized 3,700 bush
els of fine, large smooth tubers.
Mr. Phillips says he received an
offer of $1.10 per bushel for his
whole crop but believes the price
will be much higher in the spring.
He has stored his crop in an under
ground room built especially for
the purpose.
Big Ones to Bake
A Bismarck paper says:
"With a small supply of great
big potatoes in prospect as a result
of the mediocre crop this year, Hazen
J. Titus, superintendent fthe North
ern Pacific dining car department, is
casting about for this food in suffi
cient quantities to serve patrons un
til another season produces more
bountifully. His prestige as the dis
coverer of the "great big baked po
tato" is at stake, he says."
If the nineteen sample bushels
brought in on "Williston Day" and
exhibited for prizes were fairly rep
resentative of the Williams county
crop Mr. Titus can fill part of his or
der right here—if he will pay the
price.
While the spud crop is reported
short in many of the potato growing
sections of the older states, this sec
tion, at least, of North Dakota has
better than an average crop. Yields
are Reported at from 150 to 225 bush
els per acre and the quality is extra
good. Those in a position to judge
Believe that the potato crop is certain
to become one of the large and fairly
reliable assets of Williams and sur
rounding counties. With the prices
of all other staple food products soar
ing the price-of potatoes seems sure
to remain above the profit yielding
figure.
A Money Crop
A man with a wide experience with
potato culture recently expressed it
as his opinion that this section can
grow as good tubers as any place in
the world jf the proper study is given
to their culture, he said we have the
soil and climate that produce yield
and quality. "The farmer who will
put in from five to twenty acres of
potatoes and take care of them,'' he
said, "will find them a bank account
booster when the wheat crop falls
short."
Requires Study
"Different from wheat or flax or
hay, potatoes are a perishable crop
ana not only the growing but the
storing and marketing of them must
be carefully considered to insure suc
cess."
The truth of this statement is veri
fied by the attention being: given the
potato industry at the agricultural
college.
Dr. J. E. Boyle, with the North Da
kota Experiment station as investiga
tor of farm produce marketing con
ditions, will undertake an investiga
tion of the potato marketing ques
tion, with particular reference to the
handling of the tubers, the market
ing of them, and the prices paid by
local buyers.
..Thomas Cooper, director of the
experiment station, points to the fact
that this year's potato crop in North
Dakota is worth above seven arid a
half million dollars to the producers,
indicating the need for an inquiry in
to the marketing conditions.
To Study Whole Problem
"Dr. Boyle will make a study of the
whole question, within and without
the state says Mr. Cooper. "It is a
known fact that producers are caus
ed losses through ignorance of the
market condition, the place to market
their produce, the method of handling,
etc. We hope to place before the pro
ducers concrete facts that will aid
them in handling their crop.
"Potatoes are about the only perish
able crop of any consequence grown
in this state. To properly handle it
requires thorough knowledge of the
situation."

*50,000 FOR STATE
COIL EXPEMMENTS
CONGRESSMAN NORTON HAS
FAITH IN LIGNITE AND MIS
SOURI RIVER TOWNS
"If I don't secure a $50,000 appro
priation next year for the purpose of
furthering experiments in lignite coal,
700,000,000 tons of which underlies
western North Dakota, I am badly
mistaken," said Congressman P. D.
Norton while in the city on Wednes
day attending the Slope fair and look
ing after business matters. "A sub
stitute for gasoline can be secured
from lignite and this is the most ur
gent need that the country faces. All
available gasoline will be used in 25
to 30 years, and a substitute must be
found. Prof. Babcock says gasoline
or light oil is contained in lignito
and so testified before a committee in
congress." Mr. Norton stated furth
er about the value of our coal: "Dye
is contained in lignite and the nation
also needs dye stuffs badly. Our lig
nite offers the solution of two of the
nation's greatest problems, and $50,
000 to experiment for these things
will not be a very large request.
When asked about securing federal
aid to build a bridge over the Mis
souri, he said: "It can't be done.
However', the federal aid for state
roads, $100,000 of which is available
to the state next year, may be used
to finance such a purpose."
"I believe in the future of this
particular part of North Dakota, es
pecially Missouri river towns. The
Missouri will be harnessed some day
—within 25 years, is my guess—and
the N. P. itself will be electrified and
get its supply of power from current
generated by the current of the-Mis
souri river. Manufacturing will Hbe
called here by cheap power and your
town will be a large city. It cannot
be otherwise,'' concluded the speak
er.—Mandan News.
Williston Meets
Minot Saturday
Next Saturday is football day in
Williston. That being the date of the
annual clash between the Minot and
Williston high school elevens.
The game is easily the big card of
the season and all fans who wish to
witness a real gridiron contest should
be at Bruegger field at 3 o'clock. The
Williston 1916 team has not had much
of the experience that comes with
real, gruelling battles but have done
plenty of hard practice work and are
on edge, anxious for a try at re
treiving some of the laurels the Magic
City school boys have wrested from
them in the past.
The Minot team is apparently strong
and has been trimming such teams as
Carringtcn and Kenmare by lop sided
scores.
Coach Cutting while not making
predictions as to the. size of the score
says that the local team are in good
condition and full of the fighting
spirit that never quits. If the Orange
and Black team hit their stride and
play the game they' are capable of
the coach believes Minot is due for
an unnleasant surprise.
A big turnout at the game will be
strong encouragement for the local
athletes. Come out and root for Wil
liston.
RUMMAGE SALE
On Saturday. October 28th the La

The streets were packed with those
who accepted the city's invitation.
How many came is impossible to say
but it is know that 5,000 buns, a
three-year old steer, two barrels of
cider, 100 gallons of coffee and other
items on the menu in proportion dis
appeared in toto and more could have
been used if the. demand had been
anticipated. The ox was beautifully
roasted and as tender and evenly done
and savory as could be expected.
The weather was North Dakota's
best and the throng certainly appear
ed to enjoy the day thoroughly.
The Evening Throng
Many of the out of town visitors
stayed for the evening celebration and
were joined by practically the whole
city, making the greatest assemblege
ever seen on the streets, according to
The growth of the schools is fur
ther shown by the history of thp
buildings. In 1899 the Central school
building was erected, with the under
standing that this would be ample
for the needs of the city for many
years to come. Instead of merely the

Williston Schools Prove Growth of City
Enrollment 1,000—200 In High School
NEW SOUTH WING OF CENTRAL SCHOOL
Now under construction. To be completed about December 1st, at a
cost og $35,000. It will be modern t) the last detail and will match in
style the North Wing, built two years ago. The original Central building,
which stands between the new structures, and which was built in 1899,
"to supply all future needs," will eventually be replaced to harmonize and
coordinate the group.
A Bit of History
Statistics recently placed on file
in Supt. White's office, show through
the public schools the remarkaolj
giowth of the city. These facts are
peculiarly interesting at this time
following the celebration of "Willis
ton Day."
In 1895 there were 88 pupils in the
school, carsd for by three teachers.
In 1900. although there was still no
high school, the teaching force was
increased to seven, and pupils enroll^!
numbered 241. Five years later the
records show: 32 in high school, 331
in the grades, and a teaching corps of
eight. The next five years show
splendid growth 701 in the grades,
130 in the high school. 21 tochers.
The probable statistics for 1916 are
approximately 800 in the grades 200
in high school, and a teaching force
numbering 33.

old residents who have lived here
since "cow camp" days.
Afternoon of Greetings
Many citizens of surrounding towns
and many country people from long
distances paid the city the compli
ment of accepting its invitation. Old
ihends met and shook hands for the
first time in years. People from
adjacent neighborhoods and clubs
compared notes and got acquainted.
Trading was the order of the after
noon for large numbers, especially
those from the niore distant points
and the stores of the city without ex
ception report large sales.
Fine Potatoes
The $5.00 and $2.50 prizes offered
for the best and second best bushels
of potatoes attracted 19 entries that
included what were as good if not
the best samples of tubers ever got
ten together in the county. Prac
tically all were fine, large, smooth,
shapely specimans. If there had been

houses the departments of physics
and chemistry and domestic economy.
And every coiner of the large base
ment is in constant use, containing
as it does the toilets and lavatories,
janitors' supply room, shower baths,
I boiler room, and coal room, and the
"'ungraded room." In 1908 and 1909
he West Lawn school was built, and
at present time each of the eiarht
rooms is in constant use, while the
basement contains the boiler room,
the ventilating system, coal room,
manual training room, and meets the
need also of supply room.
Three years later the temporary
wooden building, "The Annex," was
constructed, and for several years has
heen filled almost to overflowing, with
students of the Junior High School.
Jn 1914 the North Wing was built
si3 the home of Senior High School.
The present year marks the erection
of a similar wing on the south side.
When all grades are properly placed
with the new building in use, there
will remain but two rooms to take
care of further growth. The excel
lent growth of the city schools is no
less remarkable than the enthusiastic
effort of the citizens of the commun
ity to meet the needs of the schools.
Business Was Good
But Law Interfered
Second hand but perfectly good
machinery and equipment such as
garages find useful was a specialty
with John A. Richardson.
Very attractive prices were offered
but an advance payment, "to caver
freight charges" was asked and fre
quently paid. Richardson, who is
described as sauve and clever, with all
the polish of an expert salesman, is
reported to have done a thriving bus
iness in many of the larger towns of
the western states. He reached Wil
liston and business was still fairly
brisk but this was the last town he
made.
Over at Helena the enterprizing
salesman neglected, it is alleged, some
trifling details that the Montana law
is particular about, such as deliver
ing the goods sold, or something
like that, so Sheriff Rolla Duncan of
Lewis and Clark county sent out cir
culars describing Richardson and of
fering $50. for his arrest.
Chief Nolan got his eye on the cir
cular and then on Richardson—presto,
there was a bad slump in the second
hand machinery business. Yesterday
Deputy Sheriff Hayes of Helena ar
rived and took the prisoner back
where he is wanted.
Chief Nolan has a' nice blue check
that reads "fifty and no one-hundreths
dollars."
Era Bond Must Go
To Chicago For Trial
St. Paul, Oct. 16.—The Minnesota
supreme court today dismissed the

apolis broker, indicted in Chicago in
connection with the alleged automo

The supreme court sustained the
county district court's order quashing
a writ of habeas corpus and remand

The governor has already granted
Bond's extradition.
MURDERED BY THUGS
IN GAR AT STANLEY
LABORER FROM RAY SHOT TO
DEATH WHEN HE RESISTS
ROBBERS' ATTACK
iy
added to the list on Tuesday morning
at Stanley when Lars Olson who had
been working through the threshing
season here on the Gunderson &
Johnson threshing outfit was shot to
death in a box car in the railroad
yards at Stanley by a trio fthugs
who were attempting to rob Olson and
his companion M. Gillispie.
The murder was committed at 1:30
o'clock in the morning while they
were enroute to the Twin Cities. Olson
and M. Gillispie boarded the freight
train at Ray and were riding in an
empty box car and when the train
stopped at Stanley two thugs entered
the car for the purpose of robbing
the boys of their money earned while
threshing. One of the thugs held a
flash light in one hand and a revolver
in the other and made the demand for
Olson to throw up his hands. Olson
was a husky young fellow grappled
with the thief and in the mixup was
shot through the heart dying instant
ly. As soon as the shot was fired
Gillispie who was unarmed jumped
from the car and ran to the depot for
help, the thieves and murderers then
became scared and fled from the scene
before they had time to rob the vic
tim of about $20 in cash and $40 in
travelers checks.
As soon as Gillispie had given the
alarm Sheriff Slaughter and Coroner
Brigham of Stanley were notified and
shortly after appeared on the scene
and a senrch of the train for the mur
derers was made but no one was to be
found.
A coronor's inquest was held Tues
day afternoon and the jury rendered
a verdict that the death was caused
by a gun shot wound from the hands
of some person or persons unknown
to the jury.
Suspcct Arrested
John Riley a suspicious looking
character who had been hanging
around Stanley Tuesday evening and
who made up his mind very suddenly
to pull out as soon as he heard that
Olson had died from the shot was
afterward arrested. Riley has con
fessed that he was there at the time
of the shooting, but says that he was
not the man who did the shooting as
he was standing guard at the door of
the car while his two companions com
mitted the murder. Riley is confined
in the jail at Stanley and it is not
known at this time what charge will
be made against him.
The authorities are in receipt of a
telegram from Ole M. Olson a bro
ther of the murdered man, who is
located at Taylor Falls, Wisconsin, to
the effect that he would arrive Thurs
day and the remains will be shipped
to his old home in Wisconsin.
Lars Olson the murdered man and
his partner Gillispie came to Ray
early in the fall and put in the thresh
ing season working for the Gunder
son & Johnson outfit and on Monday
when the machine finished up the sea
son's run. they were paid off with the
rest of the crew, Olson and Gillispie
were going to beat their way to Min
neapolis and later intended to work
in the fields of southern Minnesota
husking corn. Olson was a bright
young man about 23 years old and
was a hard worker well liked by the
rest of the threshing crew.
BETTER FARMING
FORCES PREPARE
O I N E O O O E A IV E
WORK FOR THE WINTER SEA
SON—STOCK SALES
Farmers' Convention Set For Dec. 12,
13, 14, 15—Marketing To Be Con
sidered—Seed Wheat
The Williams County Better Farm
ing Association is laying plans for
some of the more important work of
the winter season and gives out ad
vance information and suggestions..
The first and most important event i*
the annual farmers' convention which:
will be held earlier this year. Thet
bulletin just issued says:
"The tnird annual Williams County*
Agricultural Convention will be held
at Williston on Dec. 12, 13, 14, 15,
1016. Put this date down on
yoar
calendar and plan your work to at
tend. Practical farmers right off the
farm and students of the agricultural
problems of production and market
ing will speak before the Convention^.
"Special attention will be given to
pastures and in the line of market
ing to the small grain market.
A
meeting during the convention of the
farmers elevator boards of director®
and managers in Williams County and:
the adjoining counties is being planned?
for the purpose of discussin gthe
farmers elevators and improving their
service to the farmers of the county.
Remember Dec. 12-15, 1916 at Willia
ton.
Combination Sales
''The Association is contemplating
the holding of some combination live
stock sales in the spring at different
Eold
laces in the county. The idea is to
a sale in about three places in.
Williams county. Special attention
would be given to the selling of horse*
before spring work opened up.
"We nave many good horses cir
farms in Williams county and there
is no need of buying from outaiders-
who ship horses in. The object of
these sales would be to get local buy
ers and local sellers together. This:
would also keep the money in the*
countv. A charge to cover expenses
would be placed against each animal
sold.
"Write to the county agent giving
him your ideas on this matter and the
number of horses you would have for
sale so that the association board,
of directors can have some idea of
what demand there is for sales of
this kind and they will take the mat
ter up at their fall meeting. Address
the county agent at Williston.
"The sales would also be planned to
include heifers and good cows, boars
and bulls.
Marquis Wheat For Seed
"In traveling over the county the
county agricultural agent finds that:
a large percentage of the farmers are
planning to seed Marquis wheat la
the spring of 1917. It is well at this
time when farmers are buying their
seed wheat to call attention to a well
known fact that Marquis wheat,
should have the best land in order
to produce the best results. Corn
ground, summer fallow or laid over
breaking will give good results with
this variety of wheat but it should
not be sown on old land or land where
there will be a short supply of mois
ture in case of an average or dry sea
son. Dr. Saunders, of Canada, who
bred and introduced Marquis wheat
says himself that Marquis wheat
should be favored as it is a short
strawed wheat. In case of a dry
year there may be considerable dis
appointment with Marquis yrheat it
it is seeded on land that is handled
under average conditions. We do not
need to seed Marquis simply to es
cape the black rust for we may not
have rust again for a long time. It
is a condition that we do not need to
figure on very much.
Fife and Durum
"We believe thai Jfower.s fife will-
be one of the stand bys for seeding
this county on all kinds of lane
Marquis and Blue stem have their
place as well. Durum wheat is also
a wheat that should have a high place
in the whet acreage of the county.
"This statement is not published to
hurt Marquis wheat for it is a irood
wheat and has its place but should
not be given first place under all con
ditions.
"Watch the papers for an article
from the Williston Experiment Sta
tion on wheat from Williams county.
It is our best authority for Williams
and McKenzie and Divide counties as
they have grown all kinds of wheat
for nine years at Williston. Write
to them if you want personal advice
on this wheat question. Address Wil
liston, N. Dak."
