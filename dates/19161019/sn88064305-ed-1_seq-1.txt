Brock Wins For District
Attorney by Safe Majority
Returns from the primary
held Tuesday clearly show that
J. Vol Brock of Franklinton, has
been nominated and of course
this means his eletion in No
vember. Brock's lead in thl,
two parishes, Washington and
St. Tammany, is near or quite
111 votes. Washington Parisih
gave him a cleaa majority of 224
while St. Tammany gave Mr.
Heintz the small lead of 173.
The election was without any
exciting incidents so far as re
ported. The friends of both
candidates were active, and too,
it is reported that the friends of
the defeated candidate were
over enthusiastic and followed
some of the old time methods of
campaigning long ago condemn
ed by all sober thinking people.
The result was disastrous to
tbeir candidate, as will always 1
be the result in such cases.

Losses in European War Are
Appalling.
Copenhagen-The "Society for
the Study of Social Consequences
of the War," which was organiz
ed here some time ago publishes a
detailed estimate of the losses of
the belligerents. The calcula.
tions are based on the official re
ports, as far as they are obtaina
ble, and the society expressly
states that the figures in the re
port are "very conservative."
England, according tor the offi
cial reports of the British war de
partment from August 1, 1914 to
July 31, 1916, lost 34,360 officers,.
of whom 11,555 were killed, 19,
St43 wounded and 3,462 captured
-or missing. From this the so
eiety calculates a minimum Brit
ish loss of 808,463 officers and
men, divided as follows: Dead,
188,464; wounded, 512-465; cap
tured or missing, 107,534.
The British navy up to July
31 lost 18,777 men, and the num
ber of the dead being 16,983.
Germany has about 33,000 Eng
lish prisoners, Turkey 17,827 and
Bulgaria 449.
France does not publish any re
ports of her losses, but from in
formation received by the Red
Cross and other reliab l sources
the society estimates that 870.000
French soldiers have bt:-.n killed,
624.000 totally disabled and
2,080 less seriously wounded,
while about 400,000 have been
captured and are missing, a total
'of 1,896,000.
The losses of Germany, which
alone of all the belligerent coun
tries has published regular and
detailed reports are somewhat
bigher than those of Frruce.
rtOM the owll list of the GOw
man army administration it ap
pears that 893,211 men have been
killed, 720,154 badly and 2,443.180
less seriously wounded. This,
with 245,000 men reported missing
bring the German total losses up
to 4,201,545 officers and men.
Austria, according - to official
and other trustworthy reports,
has lost 2,893,250 men. Of these
523,125 have been killed and
1,775,125 wounded and 591,000
were captured or missing.
The actual French, German
and Austro.Hungarian losses,
however, are much smaller. In.
France about 80 per cent of the
wounded returned to the front, in
Germany 90 per cent and in Aus
tro-Hungary 84.5 per cent,
Italy keeps her losses secret
and calculations for this reason
are difficult, but it is estimated
that 105,000 men have been killed,
245,000 wounded and 55,000 cap
tured or reported as missing.
Belgium during the first two
years of the war lost about 200,
000 men, of whom 50,000 were
killed and 110,000 woundel.
There are 40,000 Belgian soldiers
in German prison camps.
Serbia cannot have lost less
than 400.000 men, because more
than 200.000 were captured by
the Austrians and Bulgarians
and a loss of 60.000 dead and
13.,000 seems conservative.
The Bulgarian losses before the
renewal of the fighting in Mace
donia were comparatively small
and did not amount to more
than 7,500 killed, 35,000 wounded
and 6,000 missing.
The losses of Turkey, the so
ciety estimates at 127,000 killed,
S550,000 wounded and 70,000 cap
ired or missing.
Really staggering ae the
losses ,f Russia. from semi
fficial reports it apper3s from
t August 1, 195. to February 1,
1916, 9,00;,000 lussian soldiers
awera killhd ir action. 187,000
died from wound- and 63.000 from
n diaf:, 2.9:30,000 were wounded
d 985.0(00 hentmt sic!; and 2.000,000
Swere ,niturd or rep)orted mi s
C ing, makingr a total 7,071,000.
Since Febrtiu-ir Russia. has lost
a at le-.t 1.5')0,0000 men and the
t. ttai ., July 31 must have been
8,500.000.
The combined casualties of the
belli.erzent- sinrce the beginning
,of the war number more than
22,000.000. A buwmI 4,20:),000 men
have ibeen kiiled and 1,00J.010
died frujm wounds.
