L COMMISSIONERS
I RESPONSIBLE
FORTHBSTRIKE
Commissioner James J. Facer and
Ephriam Hergesen should bo defeat
ed If fr n0 flthcr roason tuan of
the unjust, uncalled for. and Un
American treatment of the present
County Recorder, Mrs. Kato Pres
ton Theao two gentlemen were el
ected by the people and so was Mrs.
Treston and when these two gentle
men sought to hamper her, placo ob
stacles In her way and cause her to
resign, they were entirely outsldo
the realm of their official calling,
and In thus trying to sot asldo tho
will and decree of the people who
elected Mrs. -Preston, their actions
wCre purely Un-American. It was
suggested at tho tlmo that theso gen
tlemen had In mind a man for the
olllce. one of more or less varying
Hues and shades in a- political way,
ana some of their own relatives nnd
friends of tho Democratic machlno
to place In minor positions.
Tax payers will remember that
thcrd was a great stir at the Court
House for a time Incident to tho up
rising caused through the "Walk
Out" of tho help In tho Recorder's
Olllce, and it is now hinted that tho
Commissioners, themselves instigated
the up-rlslng. Mrs. Preston, who re
ceived more votes that either of
these gentlemen was on tho verge of
nervous prostration, but that didn't
matter, tho strike was on Just the
same. Help from other quarters
B was tondered Mrs. Preston and she
B reorganized the office, said Ooodbyo
B to the strikers, defied the wishes of
B the Commissioners nnd delivered her
B trust to the people. For this act
B on the part of theso gentlemen, they
should receive a swift and Just re
I buke at tho hands of the peoplo at
the coming election.,

REPUBLICAN COUNTY PLATFORM
i
Tho Republican party of Cache t
County, In County Convention as
semlbed, reaffirm and endorse tho
platforms adopted by both tho Na
tional and State Republican Conven
tions. Wo heartily endorse nnd approve
tho record of our distinguished sen-i
ntors In Congress and representatlvcr
Josoph Howell and rejolco In th'S
honor nnd distinction recently be
stowed on Hon. Georgo Sutherland
In his election to tho Presidency of
tho American Bar Association.
Wo point with pride to tho excel
lent record of Governor William
Spry and especially to tho manner
in which ho has upheld tho honor
and dignity of tho great' Stato of
Utah, nnd served notico on the
President of tho United States and
tho wholo world that tho laws of
tho Stato of Utah must bo enforced
regardless of threats and intimida
tions and personal sacrifice.
Wo aro told that tho present Na
tional Democratic Administration
has kept us out of war. We aro in
no sense advocates of war, but wo
cannot refrain from decrying a
"Peaco" that has cost tho United
Stntes tho lives of moro citizens and
tho expenditure of moro monoy than
was sacrificed in tho ontlro Spanish
American conflict.
In 1898wo did a great service to
humanity and triumphed In glory.
Today in two interventions in Mex
ico wo havo signally failed to ac
complish any Borvlco to either Mex
ico or mankind, nnd haio brought
upon our government tho contempt
of tho entire civilized world. Wo
repudlnto tho National Domocrntlc
administration In refusing to protect
tho lives nnd tho property of its
citizens and to maintain tho dignity
and honor enjoyed by our beloved
government slnco tho Revolution, y
Wo hold that a firm, dignified ad
ministration of tho affairs of gov
orment is a suror preventative of
war, than a policy which vussalates
and shifts, novor sure of Its ground,
afraid to maintain . its Inherent
rights. Repeated throats and ultim
atums, unbacked and unenforced by
tho nation which makes them, Invito
tho Infringements of .national rights
and aro tho forerunners of war.
Wo doprocato tho snap Judgment
and hold up class legislation of tho
Democratic Congress and President
in passing tho olght hour law.
Tho Intricate probloinB oxMtlng be
tween capital and labor deserves a
careful and painstaking considera
tion at tho hands of tho government
nnd should not bo disposed of in a
iimir.ont nnd wttb'iiu lu) .V'lborn
tlon. Tho concession to tho unions In
tin olght hour law noun nn addi
tional burden upon the publlj In in
creased transportation ratoa and Ies3
otucient shipping facilities and es
tablishes a dangerom precedent un
warranted In Justlco aj'J equity.
As Instances of ths Iii:oiii,i u m,y
bf tha Democratic .wtrilnljtr'Ut-n nt
("Washington, wo point io rho war
tnx-ecently repealed for campaign
'purposes, tho extrmna extravagance
of tthe professed pur.v of economy
nnd the unoxcusahlo t'l'liu1' to prt
pdro dunng a tlmo when tho wo.-U
Is at v-ar and wo -ire tesuliu; tin cats
and ultimatums with every breath.
They nsk: "What would you havo
done." Wo answor them by pointing
to tho record of tho Republican par
ty during fifty years of constructive
and beneficial administration.
Wo pledgo our legislative candi
dates when olectcd, to voto for and
assist In passing a strict nnd effec
tive stato wide prohibition law and
wo bespeak for all candidate? nomi
nated by this convention iholr lovnl
support of tho prohibition law end
their untiring efforts In Us r.fo: ce
ment. Wo pledgo our delegates to tho
Stato Leglslnturo to a conservative
policy of legislative reform and
with tho ond in view of saving the
Stato of Utah sevoral thousand dol
lars each year, wo pledge our dele
gates to work for tho enaction of
a law that will combine the offices
of district attorney and county at
torney so that tho work of theso of
fices may bo under onu hnd.
Taxation Is tho most important
matter confronting tho innplo of
Utah at tho present timo.
Wo bollovo that equalisation
throughout tho stato cannot bo ar
rived nt until a Stato Hoard of Eq
ualization or a Stato Tax Commis
sion Is elected by tno p-iplo, giv
ing tho commission general suporvl
slon ovor county assessors with tho
power to prcscrlbo rulos of opera
tion, to Insist on uniform metuodii
of assessments, to exact standards
of efficiency which will insuro clll
clont work together with su-h oth
er powers as may bo deomod light
and propor. Wo pledgo our roprn
senatlvcs to tho leglslnturo If elect
ed to work for the passage of such
legislation.
To us It appears reasonablo and
consistent that men who havo the
right and power to pass on $300,000
000 of itho people's property and
who aro absolute In tho assessm-iut
of ovor one-fourth of tho pnpnr'. '
or tho Stato, nnd who can rilso or
lower tho valuations of Ihu other
threo fourths at w'll, should bo
oloctod by tho people.
Wo condemn tho unbusinesslike
anil Inequitable work of tho Dom
ocrntlc County Assessor and County
Commissioners In assessing and In
grading tho property of this county,
and wo especially denounce tholr
unwarranted raise in tho assess-
(Contlnued on Pago Eight).

ly ought to bo concerned In tho mat- " H
ter of tho franchise for tho whlto ; ,H

Hughes stands for tho amendment
whllo President Wilson Is against It, U
taking n stand that it is a matter for 'J H
tho states to handle. In other ' JH

tal acrobatics Indulged In by the nd- M jH
ministration slnco March 1013, 'i'fll
when tho Democracy was ushered filial
into Washington with a suffrngo I jH
parade. I 'n
It seems that soon after tho par- Shll
ado threo successive deputations, HH
calling nt the Whlto Houso to learn nH
whentho Anthony amendment would (. 31
bo approved by tho now president, Tl'H
wero told tho tariff was the supremo 'J'il
issue nnd must bo disposed of. !''l
When tho tariff act was passed, in '
November, cnllcrs wero told ovaslvo- i H
ly that suffrage would be given H
"earnest consideration." Tho re- . ' l
suit of earnest consideration was to H
announeo that as tho Daltlmoro plat- h
form IIJ not commit him, Mr. V-'il- M'l
son could not urgo suffrage. H
In February, 101-1, tho Denlc- '11
cratlc houso rofused to namo a j
special committee Tho next month H
twenty-two Democrats in tho senate .- H
voted ngalnst tho amondmcut, which H H
needed only eleven of theso votes to ' H
pass. In Juno, when tho president fUH
signally abandoned tho Daltlmoro mM
platform In the canal tolls matter, uflfl
tho women visited him again to HII
learn why ho could not abandon it itH
in lavor of suffrage, too, Mr. 'U- iffl
son "refused to bo crosj-otatr Incd." I 'SI
In January, 1015, tho question 'rS
camo to vote In tho houso, and of JFI
282 Democrats only eighty-six voted P
for suffrngo, ,, w
Thoro havo been excellont words j'fM
expressing an enthusiasm for "fight- ,j !)!
Ing with you" for suffrngo, but scan- j jfl
ty deeds. There Is tho mournful "fc.B
plea that Just as In tho beginning 1JH
ho was "prevented" from alllrmntlve 9H
action by tho Daltlmoro platform pM
tho St. Louis platform insists on a vjfl
voto by states Instead of federal am- Wm
eudment. This plea is particularly ' SiB
mournful in that Mr. Wilson is the j IV
man who wroto that St. Louis plat- WM
form and Jammed It down the throat II
of his party. ' Scl
Tho suffrngo leadors wero lulled SI
to mistaken confidence In 1913 and --'Mm
1914 by pleasant words, which havo alRI
Invariably been followed by hostile HiM
deeds on tho part of tho Democratic II
president, a Democratic somite, and ' 'H
a Democratic houso. Can It bo thnt ' H
thoy will contlnuo to credit promises I
from men who havo invariably brolc- '
on past promises? Mr. Hughes fi-- j I
ors tho amendment and has firmly ! ,
said so. f
Thero Is not one comprehensible I
reason why a single suffrngo vote 1
should gu to tho Democratic party. fill
