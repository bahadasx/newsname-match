TRIP TO ALBEMARLE, BAD
IN AND OTHER POINTS
Wonderful Improvements Being: Made
at the NarrowsStanleys Capital
Forging to the Front Things
Seen and Heard
One of the most interesting trips
the editor has made in recent years
was last Sunday when we left High
Ppint in our Chalmer's Six for Al
bemarle and Badin. The journey
was via way of Salisbury, Granite,
Gold Hill; Richfield and New London
to Albemarle. returning via way of
Badirf; Palmerville, New London
and from there following the same
route as going. It was an ideal day
with an ideal trip, nothing to mar
the pleasure of any of the party on
the 186 mile motQr trip, not even a
puncture of a tire.
The trip to Albemarle, a distance
of 76 miles, consumed about three
hours running time, arriving there
at a few minutes to eleven o'clock
and from that hour to two o'clock
the time was pleasantly spent look
ing over the town hunting up old
acquaintances and eating dinner.
The editor lived at Albemarle in 1885
and 1886, ovr father, Rev. P. F. W. Sta
nley, being pastor of the M. E. church
at that time. We ot course were anx
ious to see the location of the old
church and' the parsonage that housed
us during the memorable earthquake ot
1886. The old site of the church is now
occupied by a modern dwelling while the
location of the new church is just across
the street and where the old parsonage
stood with huge oak tree in front is now
a broad street. The old postoffice
site is now the home of hte Albe
marle Enterprise, a splendid brick' struc
ture and adjoining is an up-to-date gar
age. Theold Bivins house has been mov
ed back some distance. ' W. A. Bivins,
the youngest member of the family,
lives ore lot adjoining the Enterprise
building. The court house is now lo
cated across the street, the jail stands
at the old; par. vmoiip
pufocWeirYs atnirfg" of thcTpasiTaa
well as many of the large wooden struc
tures. Modern buildings have replaced
those of a third of a century ago. We
remember old time friends as follows,
many of the members of these families
living there now : The Bivins, Anderson,
Pemberton, Seago, Blalock, Snuggs,
Ross, Carter, Lilly, Howell, Jerome,
Spinks and other families. My father
"found" the late Sam Pemberton's sec
ond wife for him. That is, he located a
lady in Talmerville (we believe vit was)
who he thought would just suit the law
ver; an introduction was arranged which
into love and marriage ana my

this calls to mind another incident wide
ly different from the other but will bear
telling. We owned a horse, a pet by
the name of "Seclam." He was an ani
mal with "horse sense." No man could
pull at his tail without receiving a mild
kick, but any child cou.'.d in safety tug
at the hairy extremity of the beast or
get close to its heels with safety. The
good qualities of this horse appealed to.
Mr. Blalock who ran a hotel at that
time and when we left Albemarle this
nrntleman was the first one on the
ground to buy old "Seelam," paying $120
in gold for the horse of course they
were cheaper in thoe days than now.
We saw the location of the lynching
of the long ago the old oak tree and the
limb from which dangled the unfortu
nate victim of a lawless element. The
-grave is beneath the tree. But that was
many years ago Albemarle has long ago
passed" it out of memory never to enact
such a scene again.
And there was the old public well close
to the Snuggs home where at the age
of eleven year3 we felt our first inspira
tion of love; the stream then known as
Lilley's creek, where we first learned

we first discovered the difference be

alike, but of course taste different. They

and the time the boys put too much
wood in the heater and set the building
on fire. But we managed to put it out.
These were good old days of the long
ago when at commencement time we

commencement exercises in grand style.
But the Albemarle o.f today my what

town, which is now experiencing great
forward strides in the way of municipal
improvements.: The town is literally cv&
up to provide good streets, improved,
water, sewerage and lighting system!
And doubtless Editor Bivins with has
lEraterprise has played a big part in this
forward step in fact, we know he h.
While at Albemarle we visited" the dar
ter home, a nephew of the writer, Joe
Hoffman, married Miss Lilly Carter of
that city. Mr. Hoffman expects to re
turn to High Point soon and engage in
the drug store business. We tried to
find our boyhood friends, the 'Messrs.
Bivins, but they were at church.; fol
lowing in the footsteps of their sainted
father and mother, ' warm personal
.friends of our family.
The trip to Badin opened our eyes.
Never had we dreamed that such a -gigantic
undertaking was being rapidly
developed in good old North .Carolina.
We are not going to atempt a description
because those more familiar with facta,,
and figures may take us to task but a
general analysis will suffice. Here are
practically- 7,000 people working . on
dam, factory, buildings, etc. Scores of
railroad engines pulling - heavy loaded
cars every minute in the day, huge der
ricks carrying tons of rock, cement, sand
ana iron to construct tne big gani,.
standing some 250 feet high, 267 feet
at the base, 80 feet wide at the top and
over 3,000 feet wide. These figures may
not be exactly right but are approxi
mately so being given as by an em
ployee. It is a very steep descent from
the top of the hill down to the base at
the narrows.. Two tunnels have been i
cut in the hills of solid rock and the
course of the river diverted through .
these giant openings, most of the ma
chinery and railroad tracks cover the old
course of the river. It is a great piece
of engineering ability and goes to show
what can be accomplished in this coun
try and more particularly in our beloved
state.
But enough for this trip. We ar
rived ' homo shortly before 9 o'clock
tired but the wiser and happier for our
trip

The Herald Poll and California
I congratulate you upon your en

in this state (probably the only one
in the south) tc have today the
New York Herald's summary of its
nation-wide presidential canvass.
There is one thing about the
Herald's figures that will mislead
those who do not, examine them
closely. It is this: While the votes
taken in the nation show 54 804 for
Hughes and 49,878 for Wilson
Hughes gets a plurality of 5,691 in
California, not adoubttul state. De
duct this and Wilson's vote is
larger in the really doubtful states.
A careful analysis of the forecast,
coupled with' the statemtnt that
Wilson is gaining and Hughes is
losing ground, .makes the forecast

FINE MEETING OF-THE
jv, VETERANS SATURDAY
:-w. . - , .
" Orfe-of the very best meetings yet oc
curred Saturday and a large crowd was
present. Commander Tom Wood pre
sided. Those Avho attended the Central
Carolina fair at Greensboro were -full
of it, and gave good accounts, dwelling
mostly on Gen. Julian , Carr's speech.
It was fine. They all love him. To see
an old gray haired man forsake the
sights and races and spend his time with
the Vets walking with his arms about
them, talking with tears in his eyes
means something $o them. Gen Carr
sSid he travelled 2,000 miles to come and
talk to .us, which was proof of his love
for the Confederate veteran. "Uncle" Tom
presented Miss Paylor with a large steel
engraving of GenRobert E. Lee, with
the understanding that it is to hang at
veteran headquarters as long as' she is
spon-sor. It was put this way because
he wants to be sure the picture is always
cared for, as it was the property .for
many years of Prof. Gannaway of Trin
ity (old) College, teacher of Mise Pay
lor's father when he was at college
before the war.
"Uncle" Tom's speech
about Lee was a
great, effort. I have
never
heard anything here that could
compare
with it. You know he knew
him so well
George Wood sent a large picture and
Will Gurley sent a picture. Other gifts
collected and presented were: Red
clay pipes from Winston Grain Co.;
chewing tobacco from Brown and Wil
liamson, Winston; box fine cigars from
John " Rees, Greensboro; crate' cold
drinks, assorted flavors, from an un
known friend whose father was in the
battle, of Gettysburg; four gallons hot
coffee and coffee can .from Brown and
Wagner; sugar, Hunter Sechrest; cin
namon buns, Miss Paylor; cream, the
Candy Kitchen. Mesdames A. E. Tate
and Bascom Hoskins, assisted Miss Pay
lor. The sponsor read several letters
from fellow comrades ot other camps
and an interesting one from Col. D. H.
Milton, superintendent of the Soldiers'
home. Colonel Milton is associate mem-
It was a great pleasure to the camp to
have as an . honored guest, Miss Mary
Powell, of Tarboro, the newly elected
corresponding secretary of the North
Carolina Division of the United Daugh
ters of the Confederacy. Miss Powell
brought the message to the camp that
the new administration would always
hold them in their hearts and stand
ready' to serve them at any 'and all
times.
Son of Sparta Here
No not the Spartan son of which
the poet sings but an interesting
citizen of Sparta in Alleghany coun
ty by the name of Jarvis who is
here on a visit. His trade is col
lecting sheep, cattle and poultry and
shipping to the markets of the world
He is proud of his country and the
fine mountain water. The trip here
brought him in the path of the great
July flood and "it is terrible to be
hold" said Mr. Jarvis. "You have
a good town and I would like
to spend the winters here but the
open country around Sparta for me
during the summer" remarked our
friend from Alleghany.
Have yon heard or seen anything
of Otto Wood, the automobile thief,
we ventured to ask. "No, but I am
familiar with the affair from the
newspapers". This said, tne editor
handed him a copy of The Review
containing Wood's picture, with de
scription of thief and stolen auto and
Mr. Jarvis said he would earn that
$125.00 reward if the car or Wood
was seen or heard ot arouna nis
coarse of travel and it is a pretty
wide latitude he takes in gathering
cattle And you bet he will land
Wood if given half a chance be
cause he knows every pig patn in a
radius of 100 miles and he has been
in scouting parties before.
WANTS 25,000 TO EXTEND THE
ROAD
Bird S Coler wants High Point town
ship to revote an issue of bonds to the
amount of $25,000 for .the extension of
the Carolina and Yadkin River railway
to Troy or Mt. Gilead, where it will
connect with the Norfolk-Southern. On
October 3, 1912 a $50,000 bond issue
was voted for this purpose, one-half
payable when the road reached High
Rock, the other half when connection
was made with a trunk line. January
1, 1915, was the limit to make this con
nection, and as the time has passed the
$25,000 ia .not available under the terms,

HELPFUL. KIND

Without the presence of a need
there could be no place for helpful
ness. Without the need of human
association there could be no re a
claim for its existence In the or
ganization of the human family
each member is made dependent in
a large measure, one upon another
for physical comforts and growth
into a higher intellectual and spirit
ual life and a fuller enjoyment of
existence. It is a reciprocal rela
tion each drawing strength and sus
tenance from the other.
A3 long as people live in this
world people with the same pas
sioas and weaknesses there will be
need of human kindness. Thereis
not a person living who can so en
tirely separate himself from his fel
low beings, that he will not Sat

some kindly- word of encourage

human interests are so closely , unit

so finely interwoven we are ftade
to feel our dependence on the
thoughtful care of others and to
realize the value of human kindness
to us through all the years of our
life.
Helpful kindness is always accept
able and in order. It does not give
offense or wound the feelings. It
