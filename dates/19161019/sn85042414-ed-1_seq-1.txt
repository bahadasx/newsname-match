Washington, Oct. 19.—The tropical
hurricane which yesterday swept from
the Gulf of Mexico over Florida and
Alabama had progressed into Indiana
today, with Its Intensity tempered,
moving toward the Great Lakes and
the Atlantic coast. In its northeast
movement, the official forecaster pre
dicted, It would increase in force.
Storm warnings were ordered
throughout the Great Lakes and on
the Atlantic coast from east Port
Maine to Hateras, N. C.
Battleship Safe.

Much Damage Done.
Mobile, Ala., Oct. 19.—Reports to
day show that southern Alabama and
western Florida are recovering from
the hurricane, which swept out of the
gulf across this coast yesterday, caus
ing. two deaths, and great property
and marine loss.. Although the wind
attained a greater velocity than that
which accompanied the storm of last
July, both Mobile and Pensacola, the
chief cities in the hurricane path, suf
fered far less damage. The total loss
In the two cities probably will not ex
ceed $100,000. Train service from

(By Tom Parker Jnnkin.)
I have spent some busy days visit
ing in the towns and cities of western
North Dakota, on trains and on high
ways. 1 have talked to and listened
to perhaps two hundred men—voters
—and I have heard some mighty in
teresting arguments on the issues and
the people of the day in the political
campaign.
I have drawn some conclusions as
to the trend of sentiment. Before I
state these conclusions let me say that
I went out with an unbiased mind
and almost a stranger to North Da
kota politics and I will give my im
pressions in 'all sincerity and unpreju
dice.
I have- talked with farmers, bank
ers, grain buyers, politicians, news
paper men, shoe dealers, grocers,
hotel men, lawyers, judges and other
office holders. I have heckled and
prodded some of them to get their
real sentiments "from the heart out."
Traveling men, butchers and barbers
Republicans, Socialists, Nonpartisans
I Democrats and. Prohibitionists phy
sicians, preachers, railroad men, Nor
I wegians, Swedes, Germans, Hooslers,
Badgers, Flickertails and Wolverines
were among the victims I picked on.
And what did I find?
The Vote for President.
So far as the national tickets are
concerned I firmly believe that Wood
row Wilson will poll a larger popular
vote next month than he did in 1912
—and Charles E. Hughes will poll
practically the entire popular vote
given to Taft and at least 85 per cent
of the vote that went to Roosevelt,
the other IB per cent being divided
EQUAL RIGHTS
IN THE CHURCH
The proposal to give women equal
rights with men in the convention was
sponsored by Robert H. Gardiner of
Maine. A similar resolution is how
on the calendar of the house of dep
uties and' it was pointed out today's
action in the upper house does not
preclude it being discussed in the low
er body. Since concurrence of the
two houses is necessary, In the event
the house of deputies should approve
the proposal it will go to the house
of bishops for reconsideration.
The house of bishops which also
considered changes recommended in
the communion service by the com
mission on the book of common pray
er, will suggest in its -report to the
house of deputies that the Ten Com
mandments be printed in the prayer
I book in both their shortened form
and in the.ir full form and that clergy
men be given optional use of either
in the service, it was stated.
Efforts to have the prayer of George
Washington uttered on the occasion
of his laying down the supreme com
mand of the federal armies, adapted
and substituted for the present pray
er "for our country" in the book of
I common prayer, were Inaugurated In
I the house of deputies by Roland S.
Morris of Philadelphia.
Mr. Morris introduced a resolution
which resulted in a prayer which had
I been recommended by the commls
I sion on prayer book, being recommit
ted to the commission with the sug
gestion that It consider the Washing
ton prayer. This pleads for God's
I holy protection for the United States
I obedience for its citizens, for their
brother affection for each other "par
ticularly for their brethren who have
Berved in the field," and that God
will dispose us to do justice, mercy
and charity.
The prayer suggested by the com­|
mission asked that "our land be
blessed with honorable 'industry,
sound ^earning and pure manners."
It also asks that we/be saved from
"violence, discord and confusion
from pride and arrogance," and that
our liberties be defended and our
unity preserved.

Des Moines, Oct. 19.—W. S. Allen,

ment, informed candidates for office
on the Progressive ticket throughout
the state that he had no authority to
order the names removed from the

on the sentiment I find prevailing in
North Dakota and northern Minne
sota, and my best information from
observers in other states-
Wilson men are doing a large
amount of talking. The stalwart Re
publicans are content to say "I am a
Republican and I feel sure Hughes
will be elected." They let it go at
that unless you prod them into an
argument. They seldom start an ar
gument.
The Nonpartisan, too, is content
with the situation, being satisfied to
say he is positive his Btate ticket will
win and he isn't telling what he will
do about the national ticket. He Is
waiting for the precinct meetings to
be held on Tuesday, October 31, one
week before election to find out Just

Los Angeles, Cal., Oct. 19.—Allan

last night sent a telegram to Charles
E. Hughes, Republican presidential
candidate asking him to make public
his reasons for refraining from "Cri
ticizing President Wilson for having
signed a bill empowering the presl

I "This Is a greater power," the tele

It inquired if "failure to criticize
the president for his signing of the

cating Hughes' approval of the law."
Mr.' Benson sent a telegram to
President Wilson several days ago.
from Portland, Oregon, requesting
him to make public his reasons for

FATE¥G®CE
IS IN BALANCE
King Constantine Enthuses
Populace by Stand
Against Allies.
Athens, Oct. 18.—Greece Is at the
threshold of a crisis which threatens
her very existence as a state, as a re
sult of the landing of French" marines
and the seizure of the Greek navy by
the entente allies. The streets of
Athens have
been
the scenes of much
rioting by the populace attempting to
overwhelm the French marines.
King Constantine has made an ap
peal to America and the other neutral
nations- against the action of the allies
in Imperiling the sovereignty of the
nation, and the allied commanders
have made demands that peace be ab
solutely preserved In the city and the
Piraeus, fearing an uprising might
endanger the allied armies, such a
condition at this time would interfere
greatly with the operations on the
Macedonian front.
It Is known that the king has given
command that anti-entente demon
strations must cease, as the very exis
tence of Greece is at stake. It is dif
ficult to say, however, whether in the
present state of public opinion over
the presence of marines of foreign
powers at Athens and Piraeus, even
the king's orders will be obeyed by the
excited populace-
His majesty insisted on the ground
lessness of the suspicion that Greece
contemplated an attack on the forces
of General Sarrail.' As proof of hi*"
good faith the king is said to ltvve
declared his readiness to withdraw
the Greek forces from Larissa."
King Constantine yesterday dis
missed all guards during an address
to the Greek sailors and rode alone
and unprotected through the crowd,
which-pressed about him, touching the
sovereign and his hoirse. The act ap
peared to inspire the almost fanatical
devotion of the people. In addition
the events of yesterday, including the
seizure of three Greek battleships,
which is not yet known generally,
presage possibilities of trouble. The
city is being policed by Greek cavalry.
A further detachment of French
marines has been landed yesterday
and the commander has demanded
the use of the parliament and univer
I slty buildings as barracks.

Western Front Will Know

Ends Hecatomb.
(By Frederick L. Palmer.)
(Copyrighted, 1916, by Associated Press)
British Front in France,
Oct. 18, via London, Oct. 19.
—The war will last another
year, according to the con
sensus of opinion among the
British soldiers and their
leaders. This also is the opin
ion of the Germans, if the
views of prisoners count for
anything. Before the grand
offensive started, a high au
thority informed the corre
spondent of the Associated
Press that the German line
would not be broken this
summer and that slow, opera
tions of wearing 'down the
Germans would be inaugu
rated, probably lasting thru
another summer. With the
approach of winter condi
tions, which make military
movements difficult, this of
ficer recalled his prediction
and in a discussion of the
situation, today said:
"We knew what the Ger
man resources were and
what ours were, and the
time required to force a de
cisive victory for our arms is
a matter of calculation."
The German prisoners
taken during the summer in
variably spoke of peace be
ing a certainty in autumn.
They regarded the Somme
thrust as the final effort of
the allies for a decision, and,
after it peace would be made.
Their tone is entirely differ
ent now. They recognize
that it is a fight to the finish
between the man power and
resources of two foes, and
that the ultimate decision
will come from fearful attri
tion on the western front,
which now will know no in
termission until the end.
The Germans are deter
mined to make every village
on the western front a fort
ress which will yield only
when reduced to powder by
shell fire and every gully,
crater and machine gun post
to secure their defensive
against a critical defeat.
