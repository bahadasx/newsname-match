EXPENSIVE MEAT
W. S. Weedman, G. S. McCaferty
E. L. Ketchum and F. Mevans,
Phoenix men on a hunting trip in
northern Arizona, got into serious
touble last week over the killing
of a calf belonging to the Johnson (
Cattle Co. These men were in
camp on the Bear Spring ranch.
They thot it an easy way to replen
ish their meat supply by killing a
calf on the ranch and this was
done. The calf was butchered
and the meat appropriated. Em
ployes of the cattle company dis
covered the criminal act at once
and the matter was reported to the
sheriff's office which appeared on
the scene in the person of Frank
Dickinson, deputy.
The calf was killed the 12 th; the
men were apprehended- the 13th
and Monday the 16th, they had
their trial before Judge Twitty. At
the trial Weedman, the oldest
man of the bunch, assumed the
entire responsibility for the killing,
claiming that the younger men
knew nothing about it until after
the calf was butchered and the
meat secured. The court bound
Weedman over to the Superior
court under bond of $2,000 which
he was unable to furnish. The
other men were put under a $300
cash bond, each, to appear at the
trial of Weedman as witnesses.

JOINTISTS AND BOOT-LEGGERS
d BE PUT OUT DP BUSINESS
The "personal use" decision does not hava the same paralyzing effect
in every part of Arizona that it has in Coconino county. In communi
ties with zealous officials determined to exhaust the powers of law to
secure law enforcement, and backed by citizens who have a passion for
, good social conditions, the jointist and boot-legger soon find their way
to the county jail with fines and time sentences which discourage them
and drive lawlessness to parts of the state where it will be protected by
that threadbare excuse, "Oh, you can't get evidence to convict." To
Coconino county, for instance, where the same threadbare excuse has
to serve as extenuation for the non-enforcement of the prohibition law.
Coconino county people do not want boot-legging and they would
back public officials if they showed a disposition to prosecute to the
limit.
There is good reason to believe that the joint flourishes in our
county seat and there is no doubt that the boot-legger is buyy in Wil
liams. As a consequence of these existing evils, crime has increased
since weak-kneed or sympathetic officials could hide behind the "per
sonal use'.', decision. The benefits of prohibition as they were seen in
betier-cared-for families is disappearing. A serious blow has been
struck at public welfare. -
Do we appreciate these, facts as we should, friends of good govern
ment? Do we realize that non-partisan cooperatien may bring a change?
Are we going to cling to party name at the riok of serious injury to
social welfare and to the generation which will soon be on the scene of
action in all of life's activities?
No brief Is needed to say a word for a candidal for county office
in whom there is hope for better law enforcement and so without solic
itation by or even permission from John, O. Harrington his candidacy
for the office of sheriff is called to the attention of all who want better
law enforcement and have faith in it possibility. Mr. Harrington has
strong convictions oajaw enforcement and admits of no false excuse
for failure to enforce our laws in spirit and in letter.
t Coconino county needs better law enforcement. Is there hope of
it in the present couuty police force? Then let us try a man in the
sheriff's office whose convictions are right, whose promises have the
ring of sincerity and, whose well known firmness will make his prom
ises come true. Advertibement
110 BUILDING BOOM
BUT STEADY GROWTH
If it is not one thing then it is
another and sometimes every
thing in the way of improve
ments in Williams. Several
houses have been built within
the last year, several are under
construction and others are
planned and will be built soon.
Merchants have enlarged their
facilities for handling goods and
other merchants are now pro
viding additional room for their
growing business. Among those
who are now enlarging business
facilities may be mentioned
Duffy Brothers who are fitting
the corner room of the Boyce
building, for occupation with
hardware, and S. Steinberg who
is tearing out partitions in his
store building to get more shelf
room. The growth of his busi
ness requires a larger stock of
goods and that means more space.
Mr. Steinberg is arranging to
carry ready-made clothing for
women and children and a stock
of such goods will be on sale as
soon as his store room can be
fitted for them. He will tear
out old shelving and install new
and when his improvements are
completed his store will be strict
ly up to date.
