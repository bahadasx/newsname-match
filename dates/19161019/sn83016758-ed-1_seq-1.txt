regular fall term of the district court
for Mille Lacs county Tuesday morn
ing at 11 o'clock. Judge John A. Roe
ser of St. Cloud, who arrived here on
Monday evening's train, is presiding.
Judge Roeser, aside from being an
able jurist, is a most likeable gentle
man, and is always warmly welcomed

is acting as court reporter. Mr. Wood
ward is a fixture in court proceedings
in this county.
Clerk of Court King called the roll
of the grand jury and after the jurors
had been sworn the court delivered in
structions to that body, reading a por
tion of the statutes defining their du
ties. Clifton Cravens was appointed
foreman, and the grand jury then re
tired to commence its labors. Two of
the grand jurorsHenry Papenhaus
en, sr., of Greenbush, and J. VanRhee
of Milacawere excused from serving
Tuesday morning at their own re
quest.
Thr- roll of the petit jury was then
called and that body was excused un
til 2 o'clock in the afternoon. O. B.
Newton, C. L. Jump and Rennie Al
berts requested to be excused from
jury service and the request was
granted by the court.
The civil calendar for this term con
tains only 12 cases and seven of these
are proceedings started by the state
to secure the payment of personal
property taxes. After the preliminary
call of the calendar, four of the tax
cases were disposed of. On motion of
County Attorney Myron judgment
was ordered entered for the state in
the cases of the state vs. H. M. Avery,
C. E. Erickson, Erickson Land Co., and
the Minnesota Moline Plow Co.
The criminal calendar contained two
cases. The case of the state of Min
nesota vs. Hans Petrin, charged with
petit larceny, was dismissed on mo
tion of the county attorney. The case
of the state vs. Fritz Kunkel, charged
with liquor law violations, will be tried
before a jury. This is an appeal from
.justice court.
was heard by the court. County At
torney Myron appeared for the state
and Roleff Vaaler for the defendant.
The assessment was ordered vacated
and the taxes cancelled.
On motion of the county attorney
the proceedings in the case of the
state in personal property tax pro
ceedings vs. Wicker & Cook, agents,
were dismissed and assessment va
cated.
In the matter of the petition of Mr.
and Mrs. Chas. Daleen for leave to
adopt Ernest Halfdan Carlson, a minor
child, same was heard by the court
and the petition granted.
The grand jury completed its la
bors yesterday noon, and the members
were then dismissed. Two indictments
were returned, charging Gus Kuhlman
and Claire Neumann with maintaining
unlicensed drinking places. Neumann
and Kuhlman were arraigned the same
day, and both entered pleas of not
guilty. The cases will probably come
up for trial tomorrow.
Frank Smith, who was arrested by
Sheriff Harry Shockley last week, and
bound over to the grand jury on a
charge of maintaining an unlicensed
drinking place, entered a plea of guilty
before Judge Roeser Tuesday evening.
He was fined $50 and costs, amounting
to $102.29, and given a 60-day jail
sentence. The jail sentence was sus
pended pending the good behavior of
the defendant.
The first jury case came on for trial
Tuesday afternoon, being that of the
Caley Hardware Co. vs. Fred Morris.
E. L. McMillan appeared for the plain
tiff, and N. A. L'Herault for the de
fendant. The plaintiff contended that
the defendant had submitted a sample
of seed corn to said plaintiff and of
fered to supply several bushels of corn
of like quality to the plaintiff at $2
a bushel. The plaintiff contended that
the sample tested from 84 to over 90
per cent on germination test, while
the corn delivered showed a germina
tion test of only 2 per cent to 16. A
refund of $139 and interest was asked
for. The case was given to the jury
yesterday afternoon, and after a cou
ple of hours of deliberation the jury
found for the plaintiff in the sum of
$119 and interest.
Peter Larson, who was arrested a
couple of weeks ago, on a charge of
wounding Fred Goulding with a sharp
instrument, entered a plea of guilty
to assault in the third degree* and paid
a fine of $25.
At the time of going to press the
case of Charles Bringleson vs. Dr. T.
L. Armitage was on trial before a
jury. This is a suit to recover for
alleged malpractice.
COURT NOTES.
Deputy Sheriff Yotten made a trip
a witness.
N. P. Olson is not a court deputy at
this term, and it does not seem
natural to have him absent.
County Attorney Myron has been a
busy man at this session and is doing
his part to facilitate the work.
Elias Jacobson, clerk of the court of
Chippewa county, was a court visitor
Tuesday. Mr. Jacobson has been clerk
of Chippewa county 30 years.
Among the attorneys from out of
town who have been in attendance at
the court this term were the follow
ing: Roleff Vaaler and C. F. J. Goe
bel of Milaca, Geo. H. Tyler and
Frank T. White of Elk River, F. S.
Stewart of Anoka and N. A. L'Herault
of Minneapolis. Mr. L'Herault was
formerly a member of the state
senate.
From Texas.
Camp Llano Grande, Oct. 13, 1916.
The first battalion, composed of com
panies A, B, and have been or
dered to the border to do patrol duty.
The turn of the second battalion, of
which Co. is a part, won't come for
over three months, and We may be
home before that time.
Grover Umbehocker has returned
from the hospital, where he has been
laid up with an inflamed knee. His
knee is stiff yet, but he is doing as
well as could be expected. Sanford
has also returned from the hospital.
All the boys of Co. are feeling fine
now. Not one of them is even in
disp6sed.
The balance of the Minnesota ar
tillery arrived last week, and Oscar
Wikeen was with them. Most of the
boys seemed to be pleased to get
Wm. Schmidt, who had a suspended here. They suffered from the cold up
jail sentence hanging over his head
for violating the liquor laws, appeared
in court Tuesday morning, and con
vinced the judge that he is now a
law-abiding citizen. On motion of
County Attorney Myron the sentence
was indefinitely suspended.
In the matter of the State of Min
nesota in personal property tax pro
feedings vs. John Kennedy, the case.Hughes are thrown on the screen at
north. Nothing like that here. The
thermometer registers around 100 in
the shade.
It doesn't look as if Minnesota sol
diers will have an opportunity to vote
at the coming election. Sentiment
appears to be about evenly divided on
the presidency here. When pictures
of President Wilson and Charles E.
the "movies" the applause is about
equally divided.
Pay day is due to arrive soon and
this always places the boys in a more
cheerful mood. They are contented so
long as they have a few nickels and
dimes to jingle in their pockets.
The usual routine features camp
life, and we are all becoming hardened
in. Rumors as to when we will be
mustered out are not as frequent as
they were some time back, but it
would not surprise us if we were or
dered to return in a month or two.
"MIKE.
Brown-Saxon.
In the realm of youth there is no
such word as "jinx." On Friday, the
13th day of October, that famous day
of noted "jinxes," Mr. George C.Brown
and Miss Allie Saxon procured a li
cense to wed at the court house, and
accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. H. C.
Goebel of Milaca, boarded the morning
train for Minneapolis, where they
bravely faced the superstitious atmo
sphere of the day and were quietly
wedded.
The wedding occurred at 4 o'clock
p. m., in room 132 of the Vendome
hotel in Minneapolis. Rev. Emerson
Service, who was on his way to take
the pastorate of the M. E. church at
Little Falls, was stopping over in Min
neapolis, performed the ceremony.
Mr. and Mrs. H. C. Goebel of Milaca
were the official witnesses to the joyful
event. Mrs. Goebel is a sister of the
bride. The only other witnesses to
the ceremony were Mrs. E. B. Service
and a reporter from the Minneapolis
Tribune staff.
After the wedding a happy hour was
spent in chat with Rev. Service and
wife and then the bride and groom,
accompanied by Mr. and Mrs. Goebel,
partook of a quiet wedding supper at
the Rogers cafe. The evening was
spent at the Orpheum theater. The
party returned to Princeton the next
day.
Mr. George Brown is a son of James
Brown, who owns and operates a farm
south of Princeton, and is a young
man of excellent habits and good
character. The bride is a daughter of
James Saxon, a prominent farmer re
siding three miles northwest of Prince
ton, and her pleasing ways have won
her a large circled bf~rfrifends, ait of jthe billing year
whom extend well wishes. Mr. and
Mrs. Brown will make their home on
their farm in Blue Hill.
Kling-Markgraf.
Mr. Fred Kling and Miss Gertrude
Markgraf were united in marriage by
Rev. Samuel Johnson at the Congre
gational parsonage in this village last
Thursday evening. The groom is op
erator at the depot, and during his
residence here has made many friends,
while the bride is a young lady of
winning ways. Mr. and Mrs. Kling
have the best wishes of a large circle
of friends.
Republican Speakers Coming.
A card has been received at the
Union office announcing that Hon.
Lyndon A. Smith, attorney general,
and Rev. Nystrom will speak at
Princeton on the afternoon of October
30, and at Milaca the same evening.
Day political meetings have not been
a success in Princeton, but a man of
General Smith's standing and ability
should be greeted by a good sized
audience.
Rev. Ahl May Leave.
The German Lutheran church of
this village is liable to lose the Rev.
Eugene Ahl as he has received a call
from a strong church in southern Min
nesota. Rev. Ahl is an exceedingly
able preacher and he is an exemplary
citizen and neighbor. We sincerely
hope an effort will be made by his
congregation to keep him here.
A Suggestion.
The Nobel peace prize of $40,000,
awarded to Theodore Roosevelt some
years ago, was turned over to a gov
ernment commission to start a world
peace movement. The cash is in the
bank drawing interest, and no one
knows what to do with it. 'Why not
turn the fund over_to the Jefferson
highway ?Hastings Gazette.
Poor Politics.
It ill becomes politicians to knock
their opponents. It is disgusting to
the public, gains nothing, and yet
somehow these methods are employed
by many of the highest to the lowest
in the game.Buffalo Journal.

A PUBLICJECEPTION
For the Faculty and School Board of
Princeton Held at Armory
Saturday Evening.
Civic Betterment Club Has Charge of
Affair Which is Pronounced
a Success by All.
A reception to the faculty and
school board of Princeton was given
last Saturday evening by the Civic
Betterment Club.
The Armory was suitably and most
tastefuly arranged with numerous
cosy seats and autumn decorations to
please the eye. The subdued colorings tfristory of the United States
of the cornstalks formed the proper
background for the gay pumpkins and
other fall fruits and for the beautiful
tints of the red oak leaves.
From eight to nine the teachers
stood in line to meet the parents of
pupils and friends. At nine a short
program was given which was much
enjoyed.
In behalf of the Betterment Club,
Mrs. Cowles, the club's able secretary,
gave a short speech of welcome. Mr.
McMillan then with a few well chosen
remarks complimented the club for
the spirit it showed in inaugurating
just such occasions to arouse public
interest in the schools. Speaking for
the faculty, Supt. Hollands thanked
the club for the opportunity the recep
tion afforded the teachers to meet the
parents and other patrons of the
school. He pointed out that the in
terest and co-operation of the parents
was not only desired but needful to
the schools. Allen Ross gave two
trombone solos, which were well re
ceived, and the High School quartette
always a prime favoriterendered
two numbers most pleasingly. Mrs.
George Ross next favored those pres
ent with two songs, and Miss Eva Ross
gave two readings in her usual pleas
ing manner. Chester Cooney's violin
solo was well executed as was also
the duet by Hjoerdis Scheen and Ches
ter, which closed the musical program.
Mrs. Cowles then mentioned a few
of the ideas the Club had in mind
which they wished to carry out during
During the short
space of a year the Clubunder the
leadership of their capable president,
Mrs. J. C. Herdliskahas, with only
seventeen members, carried on several
successful lines of activity. They have
twice given a public reception to the
teachers as well as set on foot the
movement that resulted in the ban
quet and generous purse given our de
parting soldiers and the successful
farewell party given for Miss Huse.
They planted and maintained the or
namental flower beds on the armory
grounds. They distributed seeds to
the school children, and awarded
purses for results at the county fair.
They took over the care of Oak Knoll
cemetery. The Club members them
selves put in a g/ood many hours of
hard work to help counteract the
effects of weeds and neglect, as well
as collecting a sum of over two hun
dred dollars, which was carefully ex
pended for the upkeep of the cemetery
during the summer.
Mrs. Cowles urged all the women in
town to join the Club so that all the
good work begun might be continued
and much more taken up. She then
invited all to mingle for a good time
and to partake of the excellent frappe
which the club members had prepared.
Although the reception hours were
from eight to ten, it was well on to
midnight before the crowd all dis
persed as the younger ones present
indulged in a little dancing and others
remained to visit informally with the
teachers.

I. C. Chamberlayne Speaks.
Hon. I. C. Chamberlayne of New
York addressed an audience of over
three hundred at the Princeton armory
on national issues Tuesday evening,
and proved to be a forceful and elo
quent speaker. Mr. Chamberlayne was
secured by the newly organized
Woodrow Wilson Independent'Voters
League, and Mr. G. A. Eaton, pres
ident of the league, indroduced the
speaker in a hrief but fitting man
ner. Prior to this, however/ an
orchestra made up of Miss Lola
Scheen, Herbert Anderson, John Berg
and Allen Ross rendered two selections
most pleasingly.
At the outset the speaker stated
that President Wilson stood an excel
lent chance of securing the electoral
vote of Minnesota, and that this was
the reason that outside speakers were
being sent here to outline the achieve
ments of the present administration.
Mr. Chamberlayne then called atten
tion to the fact that when Justice
the presidency, he stated that the only
reason he did so was because of the
great crisis that confronted the coun
try, and which he believed demanded
his services as chief executive. Thus
far in the campaign just what this
crisis is has not been disclosed, said
the speaker. Opponents of the presi
dent have been more than liberal with
their criticisms, but no alternative
policy has been advanced.
The speaker then dwelt upon the
legislative record of the administra
tion, and stated that more laws bene
fiitting mankind had been enacted dur
ing the past three years and a half,
than during any quarter of a century
in American history. It marks a new
epoch, he said, and will constitute one
of the brightest pages of the domestic
The tariff was then dwelt upon, and
the speaker stated that every panic of
the last 50 years had come under a
protective tariff tax. He stated, how
ever, that tariff laws have nothing to
do with financial stringencies and added
that currency laws governed those
things. He then lauded the federal re
serve act, and expressed the opinion
that there would never be another
panic so long as that piece of legis
lation remained on the statute books
of the nation.
The Mexican policy of the adminis
tration was defended as being wise
and just. Mr. Chamberlayne stated
that Americans who had invested
there took a gambler's chance that
they knew that the* government Was
unstable, and that these unsettled con
ditions enabled them to acquire lands
and concessions for a mere song, so to
speak. Now that they are there, he
said, they want to coin American
blood into dollars for themselves.
The president's wisdom and states
manship in averting a national calam
ity when a tie-up of the railroads
threatened was commended by Mr.
Chamberlayne. Those who crieicise
the president for urging the passage
of the eight-hour law, said the speak
er, usually fail to mention that Joe
Cannon and 74 other republican rep
resentatives in congress voted for the
measure. And he added that the
present criticism is mild compared to
what it would have been had not the
president solved the perplexing prob-
lem.-, N
The speaker then urged his hearers
to place country above party, and up
hold a president who has carried the
heaviest load since Lincoln.
In conclusion the speaker eloquently
pictured the blessings of peace, and
contrasted America with blood
drenched Europe.
The address was punctuated with
stories strikingly illustrating various
points, and the speaker was given the
closest attention of his hearers
throughout. At the conclusion the
orchestra rendered another selection
while the audience left the armory.
Quality Not Size Counts.
In this season of seed selecting and
many fairs the man selecting seed for
next year's planting should avoid the
too frequent mistake of putting exces
sive emphasis on size, says M. J.
Thompson of the Northwest Exeperi
ment Station at Duluth. Select riot
the massive, unshapely hollow potato,
but the shapely, true to type, medium
sized tuber, continues Mr. Thompson.
When we grow mangels, turnips, or
rutabagas for live stock, we consider
size of prime importance, but when
we grow such roots for the table we
look more for smoothness, quality and
uniformity. For fodder corn we wish
a plant of heavy leafage, of moderate
height, and some degree of maturity
before frost time. For ear corn we
prefer a small ear that matures and
hardens before killing frosts -come.
The tendency to grow a large number
of crops is also rather unwise. Noth
ing is to be gained by trying to force
a crop that does not belong in one's
county to the neglect of crops that
grow well.
A Year's Emmigration.
This country's emmigration exper
ience in the last fiscal year was
unique. Fewer aliens arrived than in
any recent yeai^-even fewer than in
the first year of'the war. But the out
flow of aliens, also, was smaller than
in th&year before so the net gain of
population was a hundred and twenty
five thousand against fifty thousand in
1915.
The striking feature is that, of this
hundred and twenty-five thousand,
seventy-five thousand came from Can
ada and twenty-three thousand from
Mexico so our gain in population
through the movement of immigrants
was almost entirely a gain from
North Americaparticularly from
Canada. Europe was practically out
of the running.
In two. years of war- six hundred
thousand foreign-born residents have
left this countrymainly nationals
of belligerent countries returning to
their fatherlands. Yet, balancing out
flow against inflow, we have practic
ally lost no European-born population
on account of the war nor have we
gained any. As yet there is no posi
tive indication how the tide will run
when the war ends.Saturday Even
ing Post.
Not a Scandinavian.
Charley Babb, a well-known Spencer
Brook farmer, writes the Union.
"Will you please state through the
columns of the Union if Mr. W. B.
Anderson, candidate for associate jus
tice of the supreme court, is a Scandi
navian or of Scandinavian descent.
We had quite an argument over it the
other evening. I maintained that he
was not a Scandinavian. I also claimed
that Judge James H. Quinn, the other
candidate for the supreme court, was
a Methodist. Am I right or wrong?"
You are right, Mr. Babb. Mr. An
derson is a Minneapolis lawyer who has
served several sessions in the lower
branch of the legislature. He was
born at Pittsburg, Pa., and is of Scotch
or Scotch-Irish descent. Anderson is
a very common name in Scotland and
the north of Ireland, so are the names
of Nelson and Johnson. Mr. Anderson
has never held any judicial office.
Judge James H. Quinn was born in
Wisconsin. He is also of Scotch-Irish
descent. He affiliates with the Meth
odist church. He has served as judge
of the seventeenth judicial district,
which is composed of the counties of
Martin, Jackson and Faribault, for 20
years his term as district judge ex
pires next January. He has also held
court in 34 counties outside of his own
district and is generally regarded by
the bench and bar as one of the ablest
district judges in the state.
Favors the Bond Proposition.
Mr. Charles Stark, a prominent
farmer residing near Foreston, is in
tensely interested in good roads, and
consequently he hopes that the bond
proposition will carry at the general
election. Under date of October 17,
Mr. Stark writes the Union as follows:
"I wish every voter in Mille Lacs
county would think over what it
actually means to liave good roads,
and that they will vote 'yes' on the
proposition to issue bonds in the sum
of $75,000 to be used in improving
highways.' That is the only way to
get good roads. After the state roads
are finished the other roads of the
county can be permanently improved
in a comparatively short time, if we
get men who will put the money on the
roads and not in their own pockets."
If the bond proposition carries we
can assure Mr. Stark that the money
will be properly expended.
Big Indian Payment.
Washington, Oct. 18.Minnesota
Chippewas will receive an aggregate
of $1,500,000 within the next few days.
The secretary of the interior has ap
proved the disbursement to members
of the tribe of one fourth of the money
now to the credit of the tribe in the
United States treasury in accordance
with the terms of the last Indian ap
propriation act. The funds are to be
distributed on a. pro rata basis, each
Indian, including men, women and
children, being entitled to about $150.
The disbursement will be made by the
superintendents at the various agen
cies. Indians determined competent to
manage their own affairs will be given
their share, and the funds due those
determined incompetent will be depos
ited in banks and disbursed on order
of the agents.
Judge Quinn Visits Princeton.
Judge James H. Quinn of Fairmont
was a guest of the Dunn family over
Sunday. The Judge is a candidate for
associate justice of the supreme court,
and there is every reason to believe
that he will be elected. The Judge
went from here to Elk River, and from
there he went to Anoka, Cambridge
and Center City. In each of these
county seats he met with much en
couragement. By virtue of his long
and continuous service on the district
benchhe is now and has been for
twenty years judge of the seventeenth
judicial district and has held court in
thirty-four counties outside of his own
districtand his high standing as a
man and a jurist, it is generally con
ceded that he will have an easy vic
tory at the polls.
