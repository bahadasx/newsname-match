SIX BAD MEN ESCAPE
FROM COUNTY JAIL
Three Captured Almost Immediately
—Three Others Still at Large—
Deputy Does Quick Work.
Prisoners Still at Large.
Eddie Shay, who was caught
robbing the Larson store in Minot
early in September. Age 27 years,
height 5 feet 11 inches, dark
complexioned, medium brown
bushy hair, weight about 150
pounds, heavy eye brows, blue
eyes, had bullet scar on back of
head nail shot off of fore finger
on left hand.
C. C. Moore, held on white
slavery charge. Arrested as he
was on board train recently with
young girl whom he brot to Minot
for immoral purposes, living with
her as man and wife at North­
western hotel has wife and chil­
dren in Sangamon county, III. Is
29 years old, height 5 ft. 8 in.,
smooth face, weight about 140
pounds, bald headed, light com­
plexioned, blue eyes, wore red
shirt, blue pants, blue mackinaw
and green hat with stiff rim teeth
badly decayed.
W. R. Grice, charged with as­
sault on Des Lacs woman. Age 36
years, height 5 ft. 10 in., sandy
complexion, light hair, blue gray
eyes, weight 160 pounds, wore tan
colored pants, leather jacket with
corduroy front and corduroy cap.
Sheriff Nedreloe offers a re­
ward of $25 for arrest of each of
the above.
Six prisoners escaped from the
Ward county jail at four o'clock Wed­
nesday afternoon. Three were cap­
tured and three as described above
are still at large. No trace has been
found of the missing men altho of­
ficers have been searching the city
and surrounding country since their
escape. Two freight trains were in
the Soo yards at the time, one east
bound and the other west, and it is
possible that they got out of town on
one of these trains.
Jailor Gus Bergstrom had gone
down town on an errand leaving the
twenty-some prisoners playing cards
in the corridors of the jail. He did
not consider it necessary to lock the
prisoners in the cells as the jailors
had often left them in the corridors
alone for short periods.
Mrs. O. P. Stewart, who resides just
north of the jail, saw the men crawl­
ing out of the southeast upstairs win­
dow and ran across the street and in­
formed the wife of the sheriff. She
ran into the sheriffs office where she
notified Deputy Clarence Vandenoever.
He ran out onto the street and saw
two men walking rapidly towards the
skating rink. Mr. Vandenoever dem­
onstrated that he c^n go a hundred
yards in ten flat and he soon overtook
two of the escaped prisoners, who
proved to be Jack K. Morgan, who
had received a two years sentence in
the penitentiary, and W. Logan, one
year, having pleaded guilty to robbing
a residence at Kenmare. They had
been held awaiting the arrival of the
transportation officer. The third pris­
oner was Chas. Hamilton, who had
hidden in an outbuilding, leaving the
door open to show that no one would
likely be in the building. A man who
was walking along the street saw
Hamilton enter the building but was
afraid to tell the deputy for fear that
Hamilton might have Ibeen armed and
might take a shot at him. He finally
got up enough courage to whisper that
he had seen the negro enter the build­
ing. The deputy pulled his gun and
ordered the man to throw up his hands
and step out. Hamilton lost no time
in doing so and begged for mercy. He
is the negro who shot a man in the
hip after robbing him in the south­
western part of the city. Vanden­
oever marched the three prisoners
back to the sheriff's office but could
not place them at once in the jail be­
cause Jailor Bergstrom was out with
the keys, looking for the others.
One of the inmates of the jail
states that he believes the prisoners
secured a saw, sent in with a sack of
bananas early in the week. The jail­
or remembers of the arrival of the
bananas and it would have been an
easy matter to secrete a small saw by
running it into one of the bananas.
Two bars of the east window on the
south had been sawed some years ago
when a jail delivery was made. A Mi­
not blacksmith repaired the bars by
placing a strong piece of steel across
the breaks. This piece of steel was
sawed thru, allowing the prisoners to
bend back the bars. They tied a bed
blanket to one of the bars and had no
trouble in letting themselves down to
the ground.
Sheriff Nedreloe has sent hundreds
of cards broadcast over the country
describing the men who escaped and
hopes to eventually capture them.
GLENBURN "HAY SEED"
MAKES'FORTUNE IN TIMOTHY
C. S. Hadfield of Glenburn, who ac­
quired the title "the hayseed farmer,"
because of his success with timothy,
is in the city today enroute to Cali­
fornia where he will spend the win­
ter.
Mr. Hadfield grew 230 acres of tim­
othy this year which netted him $1,840
average of $8 per acre after pay
foi
Vol. 15: No. 27. Minot, Ward County, North Dakota,
to St. Paul and has 500 bushels left in
his granary. He will have 280 acres of
the crop next year and will not be out
a cent for seed as timothy seeds itself
year after year. After the third year
the stand becomes so thick that it is
well to plow up the crop and put in
wheat or some other grain. Mr. Had­
field says it is easy to get a stand of
timothy. He usually sows it with
wheat in the spring, five quarts of the
seed to the acre. The crop is a fine
thing to clean up land that has wild
oats or other foul weeds. It is a fine
crop for the man who has to rent his
land, for he is enabled to keep the en­
tire crop for himself. Mr. Hadfield
received $4.80 per hundred pounds for
the seed in St. Paul. After threshing,
the straw is worth something for feed.
This year he received $65 for the
straw. Mr. Hadfield has been raising
timothy for five years, starting in
with 50 acres. Considerable timothy
was grown at Glenburn this year, two
cars of seed having already been ship*
ped while there are about two cars
more to go.
Win COUNTY'S VAL­
UATION $48,000,000
Assessed Valuation Only One-fourth
That Amount—Comparison of
Township Assessments.
The assessed valuation of Wavd
county as equalized by the state
board of equalization is $11,889,204
as compared to $12,739,779 in 1915.
This does not mean that there ha3
been no increase in property valuation
in the county, but the difference is
due to the manner of assessing and to
the fact that the state board reduced
the real estate and railway valuations
ten per cent.
The assessed valuation is only about
25 per cent of the actual valuation, so
it can be said that the actual valua­
tion of property in Ward county is in
the neighborhood of $48,000,000.
The assessed valuation of the Great
Northern is $1,118,228 Soo Railway,
$979,387 G. N. Express, $9,169 West­
ern Union, $7,739 Soo telegraph de­
partment, $6,481 Western Express,
$6,966 various telephone lines, $10,
877 Northern States Power Co., $40,

The following is the valuation of
the various townships, cities and vil­
lages in Ward county as equalized by
the state board: Greely $81,453, Iota

DR. A. D. M'CANNEl'S
SOLDIER NEPHEW DIED
Harold Patton, Member of the 48th
Highlanders, Met Death in France
Only Two of 1102 Left
The great war has brought sadness
to at least one Minot home. Dr. Archie
D. McCannel received a telegram from
his eldest sister, Mrs. Patton of Toron­
to, Can., Monday stating that her only
son, Harold, had died of wounds re­
ceived in fighting in the trenches in
France.
Harold was a member of the 48th
Highlanders, who marched away from
Toronto shortly after the war broke
out, 1100 strong. Not a member of
the 48th was less than six feet in
height and Harold, then a youth of 20,
stood six feet two. He had been the
champion basketball player of the
whole of Toronto and was a young
giant in proportions. For 22 months
he fought in the trenches and on June
3 last lie was wounded while fighting
in the battle of Ypres. He was in the
hospital for a time but recovered and
went back into the trenches. Dr. Mc­
Cannel received a letter from his sis­
ter Monday morning telling of Har­
old's last sickness but the young sol­
dier in order to keep his mother from
worrying wrote that he would soon be
well again. That afternoon the sad
telegram arrived. Out of the 1102 of
the 48th Highlanders who left Toron­
to, only two are now left.

GOOD OFFICIAL
SHOULD BE RE­
TURNED TO OFFICE
Some Facts About the Good Work
Commissioner Vandenoever Has
Assisted in Doing
Peter Vandenoever, county commis­
sioner from the First district, is a can­
didate for re-election. He was regu­
larly nominated and his name will ap­
pear on the republican ballot. It is
not nearly so important to Mr. Van
denoever that he be re-elected as it is
to our district and county. There are
57 townships in Ward county and the
business transacted amounts to hun
dreds of thousands of dollars. Mr.
Vandenoever as a member of the pres­
ent board during the past four years
has demonstrated that he is giving the
county a mighty good business admin­
istration. The salary of a commission­
er does not amount to much—any clerk
in the court house receives more—so
the county is indeed fortunate when it
is able to secure a board of five able
businessmen who give their valuable
time in doing careful, conscientious
work.
Some years ago when the electric
light plant was installed at the court
house, it was considered a good busi­
ness move by some as electricity was
selling fror 20 cents per k. and gaso­
line at 10 cents a gallon. The last
year the county ran the plant, elec­
tricity was down to 11 cents per
and gasoline up to 15.3 cents a gallon
and it cost Ward county $2,175 to
light the court house and the jail for
the year. Mr. Vandenoever contended
PETER VANDENOEVER
that the county could save money by
getting electricity from the Consum­
ers Power company and a meter was
installed and a month's test made. The
change was made and last year it cost
the county only $455.93 for lighting
and at the present rate of gasoline, the
cost would have run up to $3,000.
There is a saving of $2,500 a year.
Mr. Vandenoever and the other com­
missioners have done fine work mak­
ing good roads. The twelve miles of
graded roads to the southwest is an
example of what has been done. Mr.
Vandenoever himself rode the grader
for days to see that the work was
properly done. The county has built
other roads in this locality and next
year the work will be continued. The
county owns four graders and Mr.
Vandenoever has figured out that good
roads can be graded at an average
cost of $60 per mile. Good roads in
the vicinity of Minot mean more busi­
ness for our merchants.
The county fathers installed an en­
gine at the county farm which pumps
water and furnishes power for other
work. An electric light plant was in­
stalled and electricity is furnished at
the same time the other work is being
done. The county has gone into the
blooded stock business at the farm,
which is doing much towards encour­
aging the stock business in the county.
During the past year there has been
a big improvement in the appearance
of the court yard and the half car of
sulphur which was stored for years
in the basement has been removed. It
did not look as though in case of fire
the insurance would have amounted to
much.
Mr. Vandenoever has charge of Mi
not's poor people and while he does
not squander a cent, he sees that no
one suffers. He is never too busy to
give an ear to the needy.
The board recently collected a bill
for $500 from Williams county for
rooming prisoners and which was con­
sidered by some to have been out­
lawed.
The above is a list of but a few of
the accomplishments of the present
board, all of which were favored by
Mr. Vandenoever. If re-elected he will
continue to give the county just as
good service as in the past.

Harlan Shiek Marries Miss Hazel
Cocking, a Charming Young Wo­
man of Edmonton, Canada
Harlan Shiek, agent for the West­
ern Express company in this city for
the past four years, was united in mar­
riage at eight o'clock Saturday eve­
ning to Miss Hazel Cocking of Ed­
monton, Alta., who has been making
her home in Minot for several months.
The ceremony was performed at the
home of Mr. and Mrs. John Campbell
by Rev. P. W. Erickson, pastor of the
Presbyterian church. The attendants
were Mr. and Mrs. Chas. Wistrom of
Burlington, son-in-law and daughter
of the Campbells. A sumptuous wed­
ding supper was served following the
ceremony. The happy couple motored
to Burlington to spend the week-end
at the Wistrom home. Next month
they will make an extended visit to
the east and will be at home in the new
Ellison apartments in December.
Mr. Shiek is very favorably known
in Minot business and social circles
and his bride is a very charming young
woman.
FRAZIER WARMLY GREETED
IN SPEECH AT SAWYER
Sawyer, Oct. 16.—Lynn J. Frazier,
republican candidate for governor of
North Dakota, spoke for nearly two
hours at the old school building in this
village today to a large crowd of farm­
ers and businessmen. Mr. Frazier
made an excellent impression as he
outlined the principles of the non-par­
tisan league, which organization is re­
sponsible for his nomination. Mr.
Frazier made a mighty good campaign
speech for a man who probably never
made a public speech before the pres­
ent campaign. Among other things he
said that there was too much graft in
the business of conducting the affairs
•pf the state. He told of a letter he
received from a man who wants to be­
come warden of the penitentiary. The
sgjary is $265 per month and the man
W»te Mr. Frazier that he could handle
the job for $165 per month and wanted
to know if he knew of any place where
the other $100 could be used to advan­
tage. Mr. Frazier stated that the man
he selects for the job will have to
earn the money, as will the other ap­
pointees.
Thorwald Mostad, democratic can­
didate for state senator, endorsed by
the nonpartisan league, and Anthony
Walton, candidate for the legislature,
also made addresses. R. W. Beighle
presided at the meeting in his usual
capable manner.
The Northwestern Agriculturist
Buys an Experimental Farm
The Periodical Publishing company
of this city, publishers of The North­
western Agriculturist, have just pur­
chased twenty-five acres of land ad­
joining Minot, from the Grow Realty
Co., to be used as an experimental
farm. Necessary buildings will be
erected in the spring and no effort will
be spared to make this a model farm
in every respect. Intensive farming
methods will be followed and reports
of the methods pursued and the results
attained will appear from time to time
in the Northwestern Agriculturist.
We understand that special atten­
tion will be given to the breeding up
of various seeds, such as corn, alfalfa,
etc., that will be adapted to climatic
conditions in this section of the sta^e.
While this plot of ground will not n-
mit of raising a large acreage of any
one crop, yet it will give them an op­
portunity to carry on experimental
plant breeding that will be of great
benefit to this community. Special at­
tention will be given to the raising of
pure-bred poultry. The editors of the
Northwestern are enthusiastic poultry
fanciers, and their slogan is "More and
Better Poultry on the Farm." It is
planned later to secure a larger farm
in the country that will be devoted to
diversified farming and crop rotation.
Lee Feehan Weds Montana Girl
Lee Feehan, son of Thos. Feehan of
this city, was united in marriage at
the Catholic church in this city Mon­
day to Miss Florence Chase of Wolf
Point, Mont. Father Jos. Raith offici­
ating. The happy couple will make
their home at Tolley where Mr. Feehan
is proprietor of a mercantile estab­
lishment.
Mr. Feehan was a resident of Minot
for a good many years and he is re­
garded very highly by all who know
him. His bride is a very attractive
young woman. For a number of years
she was engaged as a nurse in St.
Joseph's hospital in this city and by
her sweet ways won a host of friends.
The Independent wishes Mr. and Mrs.
Feehan a life replete with happiness.

came to a hearing in juvenile court
this weeks that points to the fact that
one should not be too hasty to con­
demn the accused. A young Ward
.county farmer was arrested, charged
'with a crime against a young woman
under the age of eighteen, a former
employe in the household. He assert­
ed his innocence and fortunately his
brave young wife remained on his side.
The parents of the girl offered to set­
tle the affair with the young farmer
for $1,500, finally coming down to
$500, but he stated that he was inno­
cent and would not pay a cent to get
the action dismissed. The girl stuck
to her story early in the hearing, but
after a detective, who had been mak­
ing some investigations, cornered her,
she admitted that the farmer was en­
tirely innocent and that the one who
caused her downfall was a mere youth
whom she sought to shield because of
her love for him. Naturally the case
has been dismissed and once more the
young farmer can face the world,
knowing that the blot has been erased
from his fair name.

ROSE PONIED UP
Minot Barber Who "Went Down the
Line" With Grano Stockman
Has to Refund $3.00
"Dago Frank" Rose, who operates
a barber shop in this city, thought he
had struck a likely looking sucker
when G. E. McLean, a prosperous
Grano farmer, walked into his shop
Tuesday morning. Mr. McLean asked
for a shave and a hair-cut and the
accomodating barber proceeded to give
the man from Grano everything he had
in the shop with the exceptions of the
chairs and cuspidors.
In addition to the shave and hair cut
the barber singed the Grano man's
hair, gave him an egg shampoo, the
mange cure, electric comb, removed a
mole with an electric needle and gave
his customer a bottle of "medicine"
to rub on the hair and the mole.
"Your bill is $4.20," "Dago Frank"
said. The Grano man gave him a $5
bill and received 80 cents in change.
The matter was reported to the police
and the barber refunded $3.00 of the
amount later in the day.

Mr. Scribner is one of the old-time

Scribner is regarded very highly by
all who know him and there is no
question but what he would be a first
class commissioner in the event that
he is elected.

Nick Schon Sentenced to Ten Years
For Killing Wife Near Ellen
dale Last Summer
New Rockford, Oct. 16.—After an
all-night's session, lasting about six­
teen hours, the jury to pass verdict
upon Nicholas Schon, charged with
murder in the first degree, reached a
decision Tuesday morning, returning
a verdict of guilty to manslaughter in
the first degree, and set the term of
imprisonment at ten years.
This trial, and the tragedy which
was its cause, is probably the most
important that has been tried in this
county for many years, and its pro­
gress has been watched with a great
deal of interest, the court room being
packed with spectators during the
four days required to dispose of the
evidence. The story of the crime, if
crime it may be called, is, briefly, as
follows:
About eleven o'clock on the morning
of Monday, July 17th, Nick Schon, liv­
ing about two miles east of EllenJale,
telephoned to town for a doctor, say­
ing that his wife was dead ani the
house on fire/ Dr. Lynde, who respond­
ed to the call, found Mrs. Schon lying
on the floor of the kitchen, the cloth­
ing entirely burned from her body,
and the body itself so terribly burned
that it was unrecognizable. Mr. Schon
stated that he had been at work in
the garden just east of the house. He
said that he had heard no noise of any
kind, and his first intimation that any­
thing was wrong was his seeing smoke
issue from the kitchen window. He
ran to the house, found the room in
flames, which he succeeded in ex­
tinguishing. He then discovered his
wife lying on the floor, and shocking­
ly burned. The theory advanced at
that time was that Mrs. Schon had
been kindling a fire in the cook stove
and had used kerosene to hurry the
fire. It was supposed that the kero­
sene had exploded, causing the fire,
and this theory was borne out by the
finding of fragments of a bottle on the
floor which had been used to hold ker­
osene for kindling purposes.
A short time later, however, the
daughters of Mr. Schon became sus­
picious that their father knew more
of the matter than he pretended, one
of the most important causes being
the finding, under a wash tub in the
yard, of a five-gallon can of kerosene
which had disappeared just after the
fire. This fact in itself was not sig­
nificant, but it developed that the
girls had looked under this tub but a
short time before, when the can was
not there. The girls became

ed and came to town, as usual, on the
following Saturday morning to attend
their classes at the N.-I. On their re­
turn home they found a note which
their father had left, in which he said
he was going to leave home. He did
not return that night, but the follow­
ing day he was discovered in a field
near the house by a searching party.
When he saw Sheriff Bishop, who was
one of the party, he turned and ran,
opening a knife and slashing at his
throat as he ran, then plunging head
foremost into a pool of water. He
accompanied the sheriff to town, and
the following day appeared before the
insanity board in regard to his san­
ity. During the course of the inves­
tigation some questions came_ up
which he refused to answer until he
had seen Father Berne. After seeing
the father, he confessed on Tuesday,
to the murder of his wife, and signed
a statement to that effect. He was
bound over to the October term of
court, on a charge of first degree mur­
der, to which he pleaded not guilty.

T. E. Hagen of Minneapolis recently
sold his house and lot east of the Bov
ey-Shute lumber yard to P. P. Lee and
C. P. Lee of Bellingham, Wash. C. P.
Lee owns the property adjoining on
the corner and it is reported that the
Lees are figuring on building a block
and engaging in the wholesale grocery
business in this city. They own a large
wholesale house in Bellingham and
were formerly engaged in the mer­
cantile business in Minot.
Max Merchant Visits Minot
August Zethren, who has built up
an exceptionally large mercantile busi­
ness at Max, was in the city Monday.
Mr. Zethren is conducting a big sale
for thirteen days. He sold 33 Fords
at Max this season and has contracted
for 60 for the next. "You see, I can
sell Fords without much extra trou­
ble," he explained. "When a custom­
er comes in for a dozen bananas, and
I don't have them, I just sell them a
Ford."
Rev. A. L. Shute Leaves.
Rev. A. L. Shute, pastor of the M.
E. church in this city during the past
year, was given the Lisbon charge at
the conference held in Jamestown last
week. The Minot charge has not yet
been supplied.
