PROTESTS REITERATES CLAIM
TO RIGHT.
U. S. DOES NOT ADMIT THIS
Promise to Remedy Any Faults, I
Abuses of Serious Mistakes in Censorship
That May Be Brought to
Attention of Allied Governments.
Washington.?In their last reply to
American protests against interferences
with neutral mails just made
public, by the State Department, the
Allied governments reiterate their
right to Intercept and search all genuine
mail found on neutral vessels
on the high seas or In allied ports but
they promise to remedy "any faults. ,
abuses or serious mistakes" in con- |
sorsbip that may be brought to their
attention. They declare unjustified by
facts the American charge that illegal ,
juridustion has been gained by diver ton
of neutral ships from the high
seas into the territorial waters of the
Allies. The next move of the American
Government has not been determined.
The note, transmitted jointly by I
the British and French governments
was delivered to the State Department
by the embassies several days
ago has just been made public by
agreement of the governments concerned.
It makes reply to Secretary
Lansing's memorandum of May 24 in '
which the United States declared the '
Allies had been guilty of "lawless 1
practices" in their mail censorship '
methods and that "only a radical '
change, restoring to the United :
States its full rights as a neutral now- 1
er will satisfy this government."
The Allies maintain they are "sin- (
cerely endeavoring to avoid any encroachment
on the legitimate exer- 1
rise of the rights of Inoffensive neu- !
tral commerce" and suggest that the 1
Hague convention quoted in the 1
American memorandum is not binding
because it has not been ratifled '
by several belligerent powers, though (
the allied policy has been guided by '
the intention it expresses.
The note Is nearly 5,000 words in '
length. It argues that the United 1
States and the Allies agree that the 1
postal union convention does not ap- '
ply and that postal packages may be
examined to see if they contain contraband.
AMERICA ALWAYS READY TO

Pennsylvania Democrats Hear President
Wilson at Shadow Lawn.
Long Branch, N. J.?In a speech
before a large delegation of Penn
sylvania Democrats who came here
with hands playing and banners flying.
President Wilson declared that
while he is for peace, "America is always
ready ro fight for things that
are American." He summed up his
idea of the issues of the present campaign
in these words:
"America knows that it is faced
with this choice: Peace, the continuance
of the development of business
along the lines which it has now established
and developed and the
maintenance of well known progressive
lines of action, on the one hand:
or, on the other ,a disturbance of
policy all along the line, new conditions.
new adjustments, undefined alterations
of policy and back of it
all invisible government."
VOTE FOR HUGHES DOES NOT

Hughes characterized as "preposler

for him meant a vote for war.
"I am a man of peace." Mr. Hughes
said in a Nebraska speech. "Who
wants war? I don't want war."
Correct policies. Mr. Hughes said,
would keep America out of war.
"That sort of thing we have been
having will not keep us out of war."
he said. "It will embroil us in difficulty."
In the six addresses which marked
the opening day of his presidential
campaign in Nebraska the Republican
nominee discussed nearly all the
issues of the campaign. He characterized
as "temporary and abnormal"
the present prosperity of the country
and urged support of the Republican
party so that a protective tariff might
be enacted to fortify American enterprise
in post helium days against unequal
competition.
"The country was living." he said,
"on the stimulant" of the Furonean
war and would no! long have the stim

read, "the members of all parties and

"An agreement could not be reached
in the committee, which therefore
refrained from making a decision.
The committee recommends that the
Reichstag in its deliberations abstain
from a discussion of submarine warfare.
It bases this attitude upon the

that without such thorough discussion

The speaker pleaded for the abolition

the Atlnntrc Sea lanes and while
some shipping interests believed she
has headed for Helgoland, there was
evidence that the British Admiralty
, will proceed with caution in allowing

Coast ports.
There was a strong tendency In naval
circles to believe that the U-53 unless
that craft has received fresh fuel
supplies on this side of the Atlantic,
h; s hauled off shore and is headed
for her base at Helgoland. This belie;'
is founded on the knowledge that
the cruising radius of the 11-53 class
boats does not exceed 7,000 miles, or
just sufficient to permit making a
voyage out from Helgoland, via the
north of Scotland to Newport and return.
It is considered possible, however,
that sufficient extra fuel was
carried to permit of a couple of days
stay on the operating ground. By
every precedent in commerce destroying
work, experts said, the U-53
might be expected to have abandoned
the Nantuket shoajs locality after
Suuday. Merchant ships, it was
pointed out. would give the Nantucket
lightship a wide berth as soon as appraised
of the presence of a submarine.
One report that has not been verified
was to the effect that the U-53
took on board crude oil from the
I Christian Knudsen before sinking that
craft. In the event that the U-53 has
not been able to replenish her fuel
tanks, the view was expressed that
the logical course for her to take
would bo to follow the line of the
Gulf stream to the "corner" as it is
known to navigators. The -""Corner"
is the turning point in the North Atlantic
where traffic between the
United Kingdom and the United
States either heads up for the English
Channel or shapes away for various
porta on the American seaboard.
