The Pickens Baptist Association
The Pickens Baptist association met
with the church at Pleasant Grove on
Wednesday, October 11. The appointee
for the introductory sermon being ab
sent, the association requested Rev. H.
K. Williams of Easley to preach, and
did so to the delight and edification of
the people. The association was organ
ized by the election of Rev. J. E. Foster
moderator and J. A. Robinson clerk.
The good people of Pleasant Grove cov
ered themselves with glory for their
unbounded hospitality. Such a dinner t
as they served you seldom see.
In the afternoon several good reports
were read and discussed by the breth
ren. Rev. W. E. Nelson reported on
state of religion, Prof. R. T. Hallum on
christian education, and Prof. J. A. Rob
Inson on religious periodicals. Capt. J.
A. Griffin, Hon. Joe Medlin, C. E. Rob
inson, Rev. H. K. Williams, Rev. W.E.
Nelson, Prof. J. A. Robinson, Prof. R.
T. Hallum and Rev. D. W. liott all r
made talks in the afternoon.
Thursday was the most largely at- E
tended session of the association. Dr.
David M. Ramsay of Greenville preached
an able sermon in the morning. In the
afternoon the following representatives
from Six Mile academy made talks: E
Rev. Mr. Garner, principal, and Charles
Atkinson and Thomas E. Durham, stu
dents. Fifty dollars in cash and sub- t
scription was raised for the academy. t
Three wagons loaded with Six -Mile stu- t
dents attended the association Thursday a
and they sang several songs. They lef t
in the afternoon for Table Rock, where (
they enjoyed an, outing until Saturday. a
R. A Hester made the report on aged ,
ministers, and a report on the W. M. U. t
work was made by Mrs. J. M. Stewart,
which was very commendable. Dr.
Ramsay made a talk on behalf of chris- C
tian education, which was interesting a
and was well received. - Rev. Ben G. I
Field made a favorable report on 'tem
perance, and the session adjourned for c
the day. .
The churches of the Pickens associa
tion ought to insist on their pastors at- t
tending meetings of the association. The s
first day at Pleasant Grove only one pas
tor in the entire association was pres- I
ent, and he was the moderator, Rev. J. 1
E. Foster. What can an army do when
the generals and captains are all in the
tents or at home on furloughs?
Pleasant Grove was a pleasant and
picturesque place for the Pickens as
scciation to meet. A beautiful church 1
building situated on top of a high hill,
in the Land of the Sky commanding a
view of Table Rock and Casar's Head
hetel, makes delightful scenery. It was
an inspiration to be among these hills
and have fellowship with the most
hospitable people on earth. The next
association goes to Griffin church.
