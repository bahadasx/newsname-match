Elkhart.
The Elkhart scribe failed
to
show up last week. My partner
and I. took a little trip oyer the
county. We left on the fourth
and pulled out for the Old Settlers
picnic at Butler. e landed all
right and had a fine time. V
saw some old friends for the first
' time for 25 or -30 years. Y
. stayed all night at the Freeman
Hotel, and took in the pictur
show. There we run into Clark
Wix and George Pilaris. Wi
asked them what they were doing
and they said they were just tak
ing in the sights. We asked them
where their wives were and they
said to just keep quiet. We took
in the big fire at Butler that night
The next day we landed at the.
home of Cameron Peeler in Hud
son township. The next day we
took a walk down to my partner :
big farm over in Kockville town
ship. The crops down in that
part are not very good. His wheat
made three bushels to the acre
his oats made six bushels to the
acre and he thought that his corn
would make 30 bushels per acre
His hay was very good.' The f ai
mers down there have got a fine
- looking country, but the crops are
a failure. We went on down to
the little city of Kockville. The"
crops are very light in that part
We got dinner and took in the
town and it didnn't take us very
long to take in all of the sights
