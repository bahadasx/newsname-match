Greek Government Takes
Hasty Steps to Appease
Entente Powers With
Fresh Concessions.
SPECIAL TRAIN READY
TO AID KING IN FLIGHT
State Department Officials
Deeply Concerned Over
Possibilities of Inter
vention Pleas.
International News Service:
LONDON, Oct. 19. While Greece
seeths with unrest the Athens gov
ernment has taken hasty steps to
appease the allies with fresh con
cessions. The Lambros cabinet has accept
ed the demand that an entente oili
cer be given authority over the po
lice. He will work co-jointly with
the Greek prefect of police. The
Greek cabinet has further issued a
manifesto to the populace prohibit
ing the ignoring of entente manifes
tations. In spite of the concessions of the
Greek cabinet. however, more
French forces have been landed to
reinforce the detachments of blue
jackets and marines in Piraeus and
Athens. The alüed mi.itary author
ities are also sending troops into
other districts where uprisings are
threatened.
Special automobiles and a railway
train are beinp: held in readiness for
the tlight of King Constantine and
the royal family, it is reported in an
Athens dispatch.
The cabinet meeting on Wednes
day, at which new demands of the
allies were met, took place while
mobs surged through the streets of
Athens. Premier Ltmhros coun
selled the Greeks to remain calm,
but his words had little effect. The
mobs. Ifiwever. had a wholesome
fear for the gleaming bayonets in
the hands cf the French troops and
dispersed whenever detachments of
the French drew near. .
HAS nilFINITi: PLAN.
International News Service:
PARIS. Oct. 19. The French gov
ernment contemplates further ac
tion in regard to. Greece, it was
learned today. The nature of this
action is not known, but Premier
Rriand is said to have a definite pro
gram in hand.
A telegram from Saloniki today
makes it plain that the revolutionary
government headed by M. Venizelos,
will po to war against Bulgaria. M.
Venizelos is quoted as follows in re
plying to an address by French sup
porters: "We are determined to preserve
our treaty obligaitons with Serbia,
and to safeguard our vital interests
by lighting on the side of our pow
erful protector."
F. S. TO STAY X FAT IIA Ii.
International News Service:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10. State
department officials today were
deeply concerned over the possibili
ties of Greek appeals for interven
tion by the United States in the
critical situation now confronting
the government at Athens.
While the demands from Greece,
first from the provisional Venizelos
government, asking the privilege of
recruiting Greek reservists in the
United States, and second from a
group of Greek citizens asking the
United States to Interfere to prevent
further encroachments on Grecian
sovereignty by the entente powers,
were only informally before the de
partment, they were admittedly an
unpleasant development.
Neither the state department nor
the rcyal Greek legatirn here, how
ever, have been officially notified of
either of the demands. Charges
d Affaires Vouros asserted that he
had heard nothing directly from
Athens. He declared that disturbed
conditions in Greece and the war
conditions throughout Rurope has
interrupted his cable communica
tions. The state department oücials
pointed out that any request for
leave to recruit a Greek army in this
country, either to support King Con
stantine or his .vide with the Veni
ze'os revolutionists would l-e a dis
tinct breach of the neutrality of the
United States. They were likewise
emphatic in their statement that no
petition from Greek citizens, or
even from the Greek government
could possibly prevail upon thi
country to interpose itself between
Greece and the entente powers at
this time. A "hands off" policy was
plainly the course in the minds of
the department orr.ciai.

NORFOLK, Va., Oct. 19. A re
port was received here today that
a German .submarine, which may
have been the "U-53" has been de
stroyed off Nantucket shoals.
The Rritish steamship North Pa

that she had oeen signalled by a
Rritish cruiser off the coast and
that the ctuiser reported by wire
less the sinking of the submarine.

"German submarine sunk east off
Nantucket."
The North Pacific arrived in
Hampton roads from New Orleans
on Monday night.
Cu)t. Reck of the North Pacific
refused to discuss the report.
Rritish officials pointed out that a
Rritish cruiser would hardly report
the sinking of a submarine to a

that the wireless message wa.s mere

MEXICAN LEADERS
Trevino's Failure to Battle
Villa's Forces Said to be
Due to Obregon.
Internntion.il New Service:
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 Disaf
fection among Oer. Carranza's mil
itary chieftains is not confined
merely to those at the head of the
northern commands. Reports reach
ing Washington today disclose that
Gen. Pablo Gonzales at the head of
the de facto forces in Morelos, is
in open revolt against Minister of
War Obregon, and that the breach
-between Obregon and Carranza is
daily growing wider.
Obregon. as the head of the war
department, has withheld arms and
equipment from bcth Gen. Gonzales
and Gen. Trevino. in command at
Chihuahua. The result has been
that both of these generals have
been forced to play a sorry figure
in the fare of repeated rebel at
tacks. While the loyalty of Gon
zales and Trevino to Carranza has
long been under suspicion Obrt gon's
action has left them no alternative
but to avoid a clash with the rebels.
Officials now Klieve that the
long expected breach between Obre
ren and First Chief Carranza will
soon be forced by the war minister.
The wide-spread anarchy which in
evitably results from Obrepon's
tactics in withholding supplies, will
be taken by the latter as an excuse
for, driving Carranza out of power,
it is believed.
Then the strudle will narrow down
between partisans of Obregon and
Trevino, both of whom aspire to
succeed Carranza. From this point
it looks as though Trevino had the
best chance. The attitude of the
Fnited States in the event of Car
ranza's abdication cannot be determ
ined in advance. Rut Trevino is
counting upon the solid support of
all those northern leaders, including
Francisco Villa himself. who for
weeks have been uietly organizing
on the border, which has been de
clared to be Ihr most formidab'e
movement seen in Mexico sine Ma
dero overthrew Diaz, five years ago.
