MEETING HELD SUNDAY
Gentleman of Color In Target for
Fire llullet4 One Hit Mark
Was not Shot In the Kear
There are some fellows who sure
do play in bad luck. Tuesday morn
ing a gentleman of color, one Lewis
Campbell, approached Chief of Po
lice J e tiers. The colored gentleman
had a sad, apprehensive expression
on his countenance and maybe a bul
let in his person. Campbell wanted
to be taken to a hospital where he
could be examined to find out the ex
act extent to which his person had
been damped by the one bullet that
hit him, out of five that were fired
at him y another gentleman of his
race, whoso name was not learned.
After hearing Campbell's story the
chief decided tnat tne city Buouia noi
be put to unnecessary expense and
ho suggested that the man, or part
of a man, together with the bullet,
if there waB one, visit the county
physician. Later Is was learned
that the victim had secured a pass
to St. Louis and left Alliance on No.
44 Tuesday, shortly before noon.
The shooting hapened Tuesday
moprning at Orilla, a small station
between Ardmore and Kdgemont, S.
D., where Campbell had been em
ployed on the section. He Immedi
ately came to Alliance, arriving here
on No. 42 Tuesday morning and
came to Chief Jeffers. Approaching
the chief, Campbell said:
"I'm In trouble."
"What seemB to be your trouble,"
asked the chief.
"I've been shot," Campbell whin
ed. "Where did you come from?"
"Orllla."
"When did you leave there?"
"In a hurry."
Campbell would not say where he
caught No. 42, whether at Orllla or
a station this Bide.
"How did you get shot?" asked
Chief Jeffers.
"Another man thought I was fool
ing with his wife and did me up."
"Were you fooling with his wife?"
"Well, you see I was out there and
there was no place to go and I had
to do something." pleaded the vic
tim. "Did he catch you In a delicate sit
uation?" "No, sir, he was JuBt terribly sus
plclous.I was down near the station.
He took five shots at me and missed
me every time 'cept the last time.
"Where did he hit you."
The colored gentleman's answer
has been deleted by the censor, but
it must be said of him as was said of
the soldier, he did not die retreating.
Both men in the affair were work
ing on the section. Because of this
fact It 1b understood that Campbell
secured a pass to St. Louis and will
probably be made complete upon his
arrival there.

I DO YOU WANT PEACE WITH WILSWJ,
i OR WAR WITH HUGHES? :
t ' :
There is only one choice as against peace, and that is war. '
J Some of the supporters of that (the Republican) party, a very
great body of the supporters of that party, outspokenly declare
that they want war; so that the
of the Republican Party is that we shall be drawn in one form or
other into the embroilments of the European war, and that to the
south of us the force of the United States will be used to pro
duce in Mexico the kind of law and order which some American
investors in Mexico consider most to their advantage.
There is a more serious aspect even than that. There Is an
immediate result of th! thing, my fellow citizens. From this
time until the 7th of November it is going to be practically im.
possible for the present Administration to handle any critical
matter concerning our foreign relations, because all foreign
statesmen are waiting to see which way the election goes; and In
the meantime they know that settlements will be inconclusive. J

The winter ason Is upon us. It
is well and fitting that a concerted

High Vt of Living llugnhoo In many
Instances Is Nothing More than
Uie Cost of High Living
There is always one big problem
that keeps the whole world guesslug
It Is the problem of living. Right
now the people of this country are
confronted with a problem called by
some "the high cost of living." To
some the real reason Is to be found
In the expression, "the cost of high
living." That Isn't a Joke, either.
People are sometimes prone to
complain, but we are never satisfied.
If the head of the houso gets an In
crease In hlH weekly pay of $2 ho Im
mediately assumes that he can safely
spend a littlo more each week for his
own personal pleasure or for person
al adornment or for a few extra lux
uries that he could not afford before.
Then the wife assumes that because
friend husband Is getting 12 a week
more she can afford to spend $2 more
for some article she has been want
ing. Then Willie and Susie and
Tommy and Anna all come In for a
little of that added salary and the
first thing father knows he is spend
ing several times more than that 12
raise amounted to. That might be
termed the "cost of high living."
We are living In a prosperous age.
Everyone Is working. The pay Is
better and Is on the Increase. Some
times prosperity Is too much for us.
Everyone is anxious to got a little of
the extra cash that seems to be so
free. Wholesalers, manufacturers,
Jobbers, and others seem bound to
rash in while the cashing In Is good
Prices are being boosted, in many In
stances not because It Is necessary
but because it can be done because
they can get away with it.
There can be no disputing the fact
that many commodities are higher
right now than they have been in
the past. It Is also true that history
will show that at other periods com
modules have been even higher.
With everyone working, with labor
being better paid than at any time In
the history of the country, It is nat
ural to assume that prices are going
to advance.
But with advanced prlceB wo have
no reaso nto cry. The average fam
lly spends more than is neceBBary
right along. We are an extravagant
neonle. we don't conserve our re
sources. We don't use good judg
ment In buying. A little thought
will show most anyone where they
i-nn cut down exnenses without the
rut heine felt.
However, It niuBt be admitted the
cost of living is high. Nothing else
pimid he exnected. The war In Eur-
one Is causlne an unnatural demand
for many American products fac
tories In many Instances are sending
their entire output to Europe and
petting fabulous prices but they are
employing more men and are paying
good wages. The law of snpply and
demand Is working. We are boid
to pay more.
Other articles that in the past
came to us fio.n Europe are not be
ing received and naturally we mu:t
pay more for them. But Alliance Is
fortunate. The tradesmen of the
city have shown unusual foresight in
buying and they are giving the peo
nle the benefit. More than that the
merchants or tlie city are mailing
known this fact by Judicious adver
tising. A glance through the col
umns of The Herald any week will
show wonderful opportunities for
saving. Comparison of the present
offerings of the local merchants with
their offerings In the past shows that
the cost of living can be kept down,
and there ore a multitude of families
here who are doing It.
Consider the offering of Alliance
merchants. Compare quality aim
nrlee with other cities and Alliance
has reason to congratulate herself.
Thoi;e who take advantage of the op-
nnriimitv at hand have no reason to
complain of the high cost of living

Wyoming Railroad Contractor Re
Mirt Gmm1 PnpectH for Much
Construction Work
M. E. Gilbert of Douglas. Wyo..
was In Alliance last Saturday and
pave The Herald some Information
that will be of special interest to
people in this part of the West.
Mr. Gilbert and two brothers. H.
A. and C. B. Gilbert, all of whom
formerly resided In Alliance, have
been operating for some years as
railroad construction contractors,
under the firm name of Gilbert
Bros. One of the brothers, c. u..
was seriously injured about three
months ago by being accidentally
shot in the spine while out hunting.
He Is still in the hospital where he
was taken for treatment.
The other two brothers have Ueen
doing construction work in western
Nebraska recently. H. A. Gilbert is
at Antloch now superintending the
putting in of a spur for the Burling
ton railroad.
M. E. Gilbert, who called at The
Herald office, believes there will be
a large amount or railroad building
In western Nebraska and Wyoming
during the next two years, as well as
the Improvement of existing lines.
He does not claim to have official in-
formatioa relative to the matter, but
Is in position to have a good Idea in
a general way of what will be done.

One of the features of the meeting
was the musical program by the

and Cail Thomas.
Miss Marian Grebe's Instrumental

NEGRO WAS SHOT TUESDAY
tVrtnblimlloii of Gin, Pice, Knlve
and ('mi Makes Serious Trouble
at Burlington Hunk House
It Is generally conceded that a ne-
a - i a
gro, some gin, a sei oi aice, anu a
gun make a mighty dangerous com
bination. This ract was again evi
denced in All'ance late Tuesday af
ternoon when one Wilson, colored,
shot Sam Hall, also colored, while
the two In company with one Arthur
Ftmith. a partner of Hill, and another
negro. wre encaged In a crap game
In a bunk car located near the stock
pens in the west part of the city.
Wilson was formerly employed as
a cook at the Alliance hotel. It
seems that Wilson bad been taking
too freely of the fiery stuff and was
out for blood. He is reported to
have cause d trouble in one of the
saloon earllr In the afternoon.
About 4 o'clock he purchased a re
volver at Newberry's hardware store
and p-oreided to fill the gun up,
liiviiu' ready for tietlo.i. The affair
was rn'O'ted but the iegro could not
be located for all that was known
was tls t he was a negro.
A negro known about town as
1 "Pedro", who has been employed at
tli. Burlington store ror several
weeks but who was out yesterday
irettins; a little Joy on account or pay
Hay, l.ianed his bunk house key to
Wilson and the others and soon a
crap game was under wpy.
Hall li a floater. Wilson believed
that he and his partner had a "roll"
and ordered them to come across
with "ten bones", which In American
Is $10. Hall had only a couple of
dollars and trouble started.
At first Wilson tried to use his
knife but got cold feet when Hall al
so pulled one. Then Wilson pulled
his new gun and fired four shots, one
of the first ones passing through
Hall's left arm a little below the
shoulder. A Greek laborer wrapped
up the arm. which was later dressed
by the city physician.
After doing the shooting Wilson
ran to the back of the Palace shine
parlor where he spoke to Frank
Weaver, colored, and Weaver In
formed policeman Wheeler, who 1m
mH;iuly went to the scene.
Wilson has not yet been found al
though the authorities are on the
lookout for him. Hall is being held
for a day or so. (
