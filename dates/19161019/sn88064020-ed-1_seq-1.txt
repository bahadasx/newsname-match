Mother of Young Girl Tells Sad
Story.
Miss Lillian Legnon. a young lady
residing at 719 Eliza street with her
parents. Mr. and Mrs. Paul Legnon,.
was taken to the hospital for mental
diseases after an examination by Dr.
O'Hara. where it is hoped she might
improve sufficiently to be taken
home again. Miss Legnon was con
fined four months and more at the
Louisiana Retreat, where she was
sent for the same condition for
which she is being treated now. She
returned from the Louisiana Retreat
however, a month ago but with no
marked improvement. Mrs. Legion.
the mother of the young lady, tells
a sad story regarding her daughter's
failing mind. Mrs. Legnon stated
that about three years ago her
daughter visited Baldwin. Louisiana.
where she met a young man by the
name Mr. Dayries. who was a clerk
on a plantation near Adaline. Mrs.
Legnon said she did not remember
the young man's first name and she
had seen him but one time. Mrs.
Legnon stated that her daughter be
came infatuated with the young man
and remained at Baldwin about six
months. when she returned to Al
giers and this was about three years
ago and was at this time when she
first noticed her daughter's mind
was becoming deranged. The moth
er stated the girl still continues to
speak about the young man but that
there had never been any corre
spondence between them. On sev
eral occasions Miss Lillian ran away
from home and Mrs. Legnon stated
she did not know where the young
lady had gone. She disappeared
again a few days ago and her par
ents enlisted the aid of the New Or
leans police. Lillian was found wan
dering about the streets on the city
side of the river, where she was ta
ken in charge and sent to the men
Ital hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Legnon
ihave done everything they could in
their power to secure relief for the
young lady, who is now near twenty
years of age. The parents are very
much grieved over the conditdon.
and they are deserving of the sym
Fathry of their many friends and
acquaintances here. Mr. Legnon is
an employee of the Fairbanks ('o.
of the city.

bar and residence of Gayaut shortly
before 1 o'clock Tuesday morning.
That the arsonists used oil-soaked
waste or paper which they pushed
through the holes they bored was
evident front the odor of oil which
Mr. Gayaut smelled upon arising.
Mr. Gayaut's sleeping quarters are
just to the rear of the saloon. He
was awakened by smoke, and, upon
going into the saloon, saw the flames
near the front door. He telephoned
for Chemical Engine No. 13, which
is nearby, and the crew extinguished
the blaze. A damage of only $25
was done to the building. No dam
age was done to the contents.
Mr. Gayaut is at a loss to find a
motive. He told the police he has
no known enemies.
