region, In the canter of the Mace-'
donlan front, where little but artil
lery activity has been reported.
"Last night's announcement from
Paris that hostile trenches west of

a depth of a quarter ft a mile by
French troopa Indicates a possibil

"Sub" Bremen Is Lost
Washington, Oct. 19.—Loss of the
German submarine merchantman
Bremen virtually was conceded today
fcy ranking Teutonic diplomats in a
position to know of the movements of
the vessel.
It was admitted that German ofltt
«ial8 not only in this country but in.
Berlin were without information as to
the fate of the Bremen. All they
know Is that she set out for America
from Bremerhaven and that she should
have arrived at an American port soon
after the middle of last month. It is
regarded as doubtful that accurate in
formation concerning the..vessel will
be available until the close of the war,
'it then.
The disappearance of the Bremen
will not cause abandonment of the
plan to send submarine merchantmen
regularly to the United States. It ap
peared to be reasonable that another
Submarine freighter, either the
•Deutschland or some other, may now
been route to America.
German officials in Washington do
not believe the Bremen coujd have fal
len inter the hands of the British unless
she had some, accident to her machin
ery. The merchant submarine avoids
all localities frequented^ by shipping
and was not open to many risks.
The. Deutschland was a week over
due when she came thru the Virginia
capes and weather conditions were
much better than have prevailed tho
last month and a half.
When the Bremen was two weeks
overdue anxiety was apparent in vari
ous Teutonic quarters and word of her
arrival was anxiously awaited. Since
then hope that the submarine might be
safe has dwindled each day.

Des Moines, Oct. 19. Governor
Clarke said he would appoint four
commissioners,'two democrats and two
republicans,
to,go
to the border to take
the vote of Iowa guardsmen. The gov
ernor said the commissioners would be
sent to the bordtir about a week before
election day In order to permit them to
niakevall necessary arrangements for
thecastlngof thrballots.
As sooji'M the decision was known,

will be printed in Dee Moines.
Governor Clarke stated .today that he
already has three men in mind for
commissioners and expected to select
the fourth In a few days. The vote of
the guardsmen will add approximately
4,500 votes to the total Iowa vote.
Official registration of the men, it
was said, will not be required. The
record of every guardsman In regard
to age, residence, etc.,. is. on" file here
and work on the poll books was started
this afternoon.
It was pointed out today by the sec
retary of state that under the civil war
law the guardsmen can vote only on
national, state and county candidates.
The law does not provide for. the
casting of votes for township offices,
constables, Justices of the peace or su
pervisors.
Attorney General Cosson said today
that as far as he Is able to learn Iowa
is the only state In the union In which
an active existing statute has been
found providing for participation of
soldiers In the field in elections. In
other states new laws have been pissed
or existing laws have been held Invalid.

At a period when the weather Is ad

Brittati Morale Beat.
It is a universal remark among the
British- that never has -the morale* of
the prisoners varied more than now.
"You will notice that we are always
taking prisoners and the Germans get
very few of ours," said a staff officer.
"Wlien small parties of our men get
into haaardoua positions they die rath

ale an A the temper of the situation.
Some Germans have never fought bet

badly as In the last few Weeks. Today,
for example^ twenty Germans prac

Illusion that these prisoners typified
the eondltlon of the Gennan army as a

ready to fight with that ferocity which
expects ho quarter.
"However, whether It is a German
who throws up his hand on the ap

British Ffont in France, via London,
Oct. 19.—The war will last another
year, according to the consensus of
opinion among the British soldiers and
their leaders. It is also the opinion of
the Germans if the views of prisoners
count for anything. Before the grand
offensive started a ihigh authority In
formed the correspondent of the As
sociated Press that thfe German line
would not be broken this summer and
that slow operations wearing down the
Germans would be inaugurated. VV nil
the aptproach of winter conditions this
-officer recalled his prediction and said:
"We knew What the German re
sources were and what ours were and
wiiat time was required to force a de
cisive victory for our arms."
Germans to Resist to Last,
German prisoners taken during the
summer invariably spoke of peafce be
ing a certainty in the autumn. They
regarded the Somme thriist as a final
effort of the allies for a decision and
that after It peace would be made.
Their tone had been entirely different
of late. Thap recognise that It Is to
be a fight to a finish between the man
power and resources of the two foes
and an ultimate decision would come
from the fearful attrition on the wes
tern front, wtotch now will know no in

which will yield only when reduced to

Liner Alaunia Is
•Sunk by Mine in
English Channel
New York, Oct. 19.—The Cunard
liner Alaunia, Has been sunk by a mine
In the English channel between Fal
mouth and London*tjuccording to cable
advices to the CunavA'llne here today.
The Alaunia sailed from thlB port Oct.
7, with passengers but the Cunard line
officials believe that they were att land
ed at Kalmouth.
Captaln Bennison and kiome ^f the
crew were saved, according to the cable
message, but some ate missing.
The Alaunia called at Falmouth on
Tuesday and was On her way to Lon
don when she struck the mine some
time this morning.
The Alaunla's crew numbered 260.
When she sailed from New York she
carried 185 cabin passengers and fifty
eight steerage, of whom a few were
Americans. She was a comparatively
new boat, having been built in 1913. She
was 520 feet long and had a gross ton
nage ot 18,405, with 64 foot beam and
a depth of 46 feet. The text of the mes
sage received from Liverpool indicated
there were some passengers aboard but
that they were saved. It read:
"Alaunia struck mine in English
channel this morning. Sunk during the
forenoon. Passengers and majority of
crew saved. Several missing."
She carried* a cargo of merchandise,
including war supplies of between 12,
0)0 and 14,000 tons, and her voyage from
Falmouth to London was to discharge
her cargo at the latter port.
tremendous gains, eatceedlng anything
anticipated by skilled politicians, are
entirely in old time republican terri
tory and that lossep are-^ln ^regular
democratic wards.
Democrats, frankly admitting that
they have no figures to produce, base
their hope for Wilson upon,the always
repeated assertion that the women are
solidly for the president, "because he
kopt us out of war."
For the iflrst time since the inception
of the 1916 campaign the republican
state and county headquarters wore an
air of cocky confidence. Buoyancy of
spirits at Great Northern state head
quarters and at county headquarters
in Lia Salle street was reflected imme
diately at the national quarters in the
Conway building.
After all Is said and done, and while
the registration books are awaiting the
final canvass that will conclude Satur
day night, they show the names of
504,467 men and 104,261 women and
Comparatively few eff these names will
be stricken at Sljltirday night's de
cision.
Reports -from downstate cities op

laws as Chicago, sere uniform. There
was ah. immehfee registration of both
men and women te all these cities.

Chicago, Oct. 19.—The public is con

bakers. The 10 cent jump in the
price of wheat In the last two days sent
flour up 76 cents a barrel, which caused
the big bakers to announce that they
would have to make further advances
unless something unforeseen lowers the
price of flour. Bakers paid 9.60 a bar

highest price in Chicago in twenty
years.
"Unless an embargo on the exporta

satd Paul Schulz, a prothlnent baker,
"there will be a wheat famine before

Omaha, Oct. 19.—A rain and' sleet
storm which lasted most of the night
turned to snow here this morning and
at 10:30 was still falling heavily. The
snow and blizzard extended over prac
tically all of South Dakota, Nebraska
and western Iowa. At Norfolk, Neb.,
four inches of snow was reported, to
gether with a high northwest wind.
At Sioux Falls, S. D., the tempera
ture was below the freezing point with
two Inches of snow that was wet and
was thus prevented from drifting by
a high wind. The storm In South Da
kota continued unabated at 10 a. m.
Western Iowa also felt the grip of
the storm. Sioux City reported two
inohes of snow. The blizzard will be of
great benefit to the wheat crop, it is
said, dry weather having prevailed in
the state for several weeks.

Mobile, Ala., Oct. 19.—Southern Ala

great property and marine loss. Altho
the wind attained a greater velocity
than that whloh accompanied the
storm last July, both Mobile and Pen
sacola suffered far less damage. The
total loss in the two cities probably
will not exceed $100,000.
The chief damage here was to rail
road sheds, and terminals and to tele
phone, telegndph and light and power
yrires. Several perponti were blown
thru plate-glass windows, hut. escaped

Train 8sr»ies Suspended.
At Pensacola the government aero
station Escaped.' The electric light
plant was put out of commission. Train
service from Pensacola to Jacksonville
will be suspended for a week.
Two small vessels here sank, while
four others were driven ashore. A
number of small craft were destroyed.
AtyPepsacola one steamer went down,
another is missing, with the fate of the
ch^w undetermined, three fishing boats
were blown ashore and two big freight

Alsbsms Hit Hsrdeat.
Tho the storm's intensity decreased
as it swept inland, southern Alabama
suffered considerably, houses being un
roofed and poles blown down at Opp
and Troy, while minor damage was
done in a number of smaller towns.
Standing timber also Is said to have
been leveled In many places, but the
citrus fruit crop in both thiB state and
Florida apparently did not suffer to
any great extent.
The storm was accompanied by two
distinct earthquake shocks, which were
felt at) far north as Louisville, Ky., and
as far east as Augusta, Ga. The
tremors were more decided at Birm
ingham than elsewhere and there thou
sands of persons rushed from their
homes and offices, but no material
damage was done.
The earth shocks were felt shortly
after 4 o'clock, and were severest In
Montgomery and Birmingham, Ala.,
where swaying office buildings were
emptied within a few minutes. In
these cities chimneys were destroyed
and articles were hurled from shelves
in residences and shops. Elsewhere no
damage was reported.
The earthquake was felt as far
north as Louisville, Ky., and east to
Augusta, Ga. Its duration was about
three minutes and there were two
shocks.
Everywhere the high winds was ac
companied by a torrential downpour
of water. At Burrwood, La., there
was a fall of nearly eleven Inches dur

MAY REVISE PRAYER BOOK. i,
House of Deputies of Episcopal Church
May Add New Prayers.
St. Louis, Oct. 19.—'Line by line, th®
612 clergymen and laymen composing
the house of deputies of the general
convention of the Protestant Bplscopal
church are going over their, prayer.
books In an effort to enrich it to meet
demands for greater freedom in the
service. Discussion of enrichment by
the addition of new prayers was on tha
calendar today.
The proposed changes in the main
are technical. Some of the deputies
fear that any scheme of revision, might
Involve doctrinal changes. It is ex
pected that recommendations of tha
commission to oorrect mistranslations
of the holy scripture will be discussed
today. One proposal Is to* change the
word "damnation" to "condemnation."*
Women's right to be elected mem
bers of the house of deputies of futura
general conventions of the Protestant
Episcopal church was denied by action
of the house of bishops at the general
convention.
The proposal was killed without de
bate. No announcement of the action
of the bishops, all their sessions be
ing secret, was made to tho house
deputies or the newspapers, but a few
outsiders were informed that tho vots
against the women was by acclama
tion and was almost unanimous.
Meanwhile Hubert II. Gsriincr, 4
deputy from Maine, formerly presi
dent of the National Brotherhood ol
St. Andrew, who Introduced the pro
posed constitutional amendment and
saved it yesterday by a quick parlia
mentary move In the house of deputies
by which it was placed on the calen
dar for future discussion, reported that
the movement for its adoption by tha
deputies was gaining in strength.
The principal argument made in
favor of granting women the right to
sit as deputies in the convention ts
that, since they are allowed to do
most of the work of the church, they
ought to Jielp make the church laws.
Whatever action the house of depu
ties may take on the proposal, the
action already taken by the upper
house of the convention will prevent
the submission of the proposed con
stitutional amendment to the dioceses.
