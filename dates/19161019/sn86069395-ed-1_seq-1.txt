Tlicrc arc now 43 County Agents in
Kentucky. s
The oldest man In Chicago, Jacob
' Harris, need 102, n Republican since
1801, has come out for Wilson.
The Democaatic Women's Bureau
Irfs opened headquarters in Seol-
' bach's Hotel, Louisville, with Mrs.
Hardio P. Ripy, chairman, in charge.
Elimination of the word "obey" in
the woman's answer in the Episcopal
marriage service was recommended
atiSt. Louis, but action deferred for
three years.
Costs ark not part of a fine and re
mission of the latter does not carry
exoneration from costs with it in the
opiAon of Assistant Attorney General
Charles H. Morris.
The Booster trips arc bearing fruit
already. One of the merchants sold
three sui(s of clothes and another a
a'.bill of groceries, to people from
Bumpus Mill, Monday.
The Court of Appeals affirmed the
JeiFerson Circuit Court, which dis
missed a revenue agent's suit to col
lect an inheritance tax on $300,0b0
adjudged to Ellen J. Ewald, widow
of L. P. Ewald.
The Allies have seized the entire
navy of Greece and recognized a re
bellion and provisional government
on the island of Crete. Things seem,
to be drifting towards a republicwith
Venezelos at the head of it.

The delegatps to the State Medical
Society's meeting here Oct. 24 to 26
will come in Tupsday and the first
meeting will be Tuesday night. All
indications point to an attendance of
300 orM00 doctors and GO ladies.
Democrats should bear in mind that
the vote for Stanley and Morrow last
year showed a majority for Morrow
in the Third Judicial district. Chris
tian gave 2100 majority to Morrow
due to disaffection among Democrats.
No such disaffection is apparent this
year towards Wilson or Judge Bush,
but it must not be overlooked that the
figures show that Judge Bush's elec
tion cannot be taken for granted.
When the" Boosters get to Cerulean
they will find the hospitable home of
'Mr. and Mrs. W. N. Stice thrown
open to them with hot coffee and re
freshments for the visitors. If neces
sary one of the ten-minute hot-air
speeches will be cut to make room for
hot coffee. Mrs. Stice's hospitality is
proverbial and many Hopkinsville
people have been entertained at her
home. Mr. Stice operates the flour
mill at Cerulean.
Apparently there are very few
Hughes supporters in New York who
are .willing to risk their money by
laying odds on their . tavorite's chanc
es at 10 to 7. Saturday large quanti
ties of Wilson money appeared in
Wall Street and other betting centers.
The Wilson men sought to bet it at 10
to 7, taking the short end, but they
found no one willing to lay those odds.
A wealthy Ohio Democrat also ap
peared with $25,000, which he tried
to lay against $25,000 that Wilson
would carry Ohio, Hp found no tak
ers. MR AIIFNSWflRTH'K DATES.

BOOSTER TRIP
POSTPONED
Rain Yesterday Made Dirt
Roads Too Heavy For
The Schedule.
NEXT TUESDAY THE DAY
Route Extended to Golden
Pond Across TKe Cum
berland River.
Owing to the continued rain yester
day, the Committee met at 2 p.m. and
postponed, the trip to Tuesday, Oct.
24. The roads were deemed too heavy
for the autos to make schedule time.
It was also decided to put Golden
Pond on the list of places to be visit
ed, the time being 3:30 in the after
noon. New bills will be taken or
sent along the route in a day or two.
H. H. Abernathy and Morgan Boyd
went over the route of the Caldwell
Trigg trip of the Boosters Tuesday
and found a cordial welcome awaiting
the visitors all along the route. They
were also" asked to put Golden Pond
on the schedule, which is 3 miles
from Canton, between the rivers. A
detail will be sent there from Canton,
as it is not practicable for all of the
cars to be ferried across the river in
time.
The meeting Monday night decided
on the schedule that is given in this
article and another meeting Tuesday
night Received a report of the path
finders, z
Lorenzo K. Wood and Pettus White
decided yesterday to make the trip
and will be given some speaking as
signments. Both have it in them to
make fine boosters, and both come
from'the territory to be covered.
Princeton has made a request for a
visit, but this will be made later in
connection with the Dawson trip.
The committee on automobiles were
at work yesterday and expected to
have no trouble getting all of the cars
needed, about 20 to 25. It was made
plain that any man who takes liquors
on the trip will be unwelcome and
will be exposed. It is to be a busi
ness trip and not a junket or a jam
boree. Its high character will be
maintained at all hazards.

MIUAUUN
Calls Forth the Following
Statement to Newspaper
Readers,
To newspaper readers of Kentucky:
The Executive Committee of the
Kentucky Press Association wishes to
bring to the attention of the newspa
per readers and the friends of the
press, the serious situation confront
ing the publishers at this time, and
point out some facts which we feel
should be communicated to you in
our attempt to meet conditions recent
ly thrust upon us. We do this after
much thought on the matter, feeling
that we are acting, for the good of
both publisher and reader. Doubt
less you have been, or will be, called
upon to pay a few cents more on
your job work, and in some instances
more for yourpapcr and advertising
in cases where subscriptions and ad
vertising rates have been at the mini
mum. In the interest of a free press we
ask you to meet the advance cheer
fully.
There may be ample excuse, slight
excuse or no excuse to advance the
prices on us as they have been ad
vanced, but the fact remains that we
are paying trom 5U to 500 per cent
more for our paper stock, inks, oils,
gasoline, metal, etc., than we did
eight months ago.
Paper makers insist that there must
be a cutting down in the demand up
on them; that they are working three
shifts a day, and at this season of the
year when they should be accumulat
ing n reserve stock, they cannot sup
ply the demand. Large publishers
everywhere are trying to meet the
suggestion of the paper makers by the
strictest economy, in which they are
cutting down the size of paper mar
gins and granting no return of unsold
papers. Small publishers have.slight
opportunity to economize in this man
ner. The Federal Trade Commission
is deeply concerned and alarmed but
so far seem powerless to suggest
feasible or adequate relief methods.
Under existing circumstances few
newspapers can continue long with
out readjustment. Hundreds of the
weaker ones have already gone under
and many more are about to suspend.
There is a remedy and it lies in the
strictest economy, advancement of
rates on job work, advertising and
subscriptions. It matters not how
reluctant publishers are to do this, it
will have to be done if they continue
in business, and continue to be use
ful to their readers and patrons.
In conclusion, we call on persons
who believe in the mission of a free
press to co-operate with us in adjust
ing our business to these new and
unheard of conditions.
THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,
Of the Kentucky Press Association.
P. S. Since the above statement
was prepared we note that a number
of press associations have prepared
similar statements to the public.

This Week.
Lovers of horse racing will have
the opportunity of seeing some fine
sport at the Pennyroyal Fair grounds
tomorrow and the next day, when a
number of races are scheduled to be
pulled off. There will be about 30
horses here for the event and an
addition to the races there will be
other attractions and interesting con
tests, giving each afternoon a full
program. The races will be for the
purpose of actually determining
which horses out of a considerable
number which have been making a
circuit of southern fairs and which
have been racing against each other
this season, are really the best in
their classes, and .there will be the
keenest sort of competition between
the horse owners themselves.
Among the horse owners are Wal
ter Hutchinson, of St. Louis; J. W.
Tulis, of Galesburg, III.; J. W. Miller,
of Hickman, Ky., Tom Reynolds, of
Chicago; J. T. Fowler, of Martins

"Gully Street" damage suits, was left
open for argument while Judge
j Breathitt went to Madisonville in the
' Keach case. It is thus left in an un
settled condition.
The Jesup will case, involving the
property of the late Mrs. W. II. Jesup,

vn TTiuuiiv
President Prayed With His
Cabinet That Peace
Might Prevail.
In his speech at Madisonville Tues
day, Senator Ollie James, in the
course of a great speech said:
"The only thing they've got against
Wilson is that he didn't hang crepe
on the door of the millions of Ameri
can homes. They charge that he has
written notes yes he has, and is
there anybody that can beat him writ
ing them? If some other rulers across
the Atlantic had written notes like
those written by Woodrow Wilson
there would have been no European
war. With his notes he has wrung
from the most militant power that
ever brooded over battlefield absolute
concessions in the matter of subma
rine warfare and made it conform to
the demands of the United States.
"Behold whilst our president who
loves mankind is busy grappling with
foreign matters to keep us out of. war,
there bq those who shoot him in the
back.
"Behold Washington praying for
victory at Valley Forge; behold Lin
coln as he prays that the war of sec
tions might be averted; behold
Woodrow Wilson when he called the
cabinet together to consider the Lusi-
tania affair when ho said to them:
'Gentlemen I don't know whether
you believe in the efiicacy of prayer
or not, but I do,' and he knelt there
with those men in his office and asked
God that this country might be spared
from war, and that "prayer'was un
sweied." Senator James concluded his mag
nificent speech witli this peroration:
Behold this nation is at peajie
millions of toilers and happy homes
with the family circle unbroken.
When all of the turmoil and tribula
tion of this earth is over, and when
we stand in the great white light of
the judgment dawn, there will stand
Woodrow Wilson with clean hands
and a clear conscience, and the Mas
ter will say unto him: 'Blessed arc
the peace makers, for they shall in
herit the Kingdom of Heaven.' "

CLASHES NEARLY MISSED
Austro-German Offensive in
Galicia Nets Trenches on
Front of Over Mile.
London, Oct. 18. Volhynia, Galicia
and Transylvania are still the points
where the heaviest fighting is taking
place. Along the Sommc front in
France, bombardments alone have
prevailed, except to the east of Bel-loy-cn-Santerrc,
where the Germans
threw two attacks against the French,
only to be repulsed.
In Macedonia, the hostilities have
been confined mainly to patrol engage
ments and artillery duels. Bad weath
er has set in throughout the Austro
Italian theater and witli snow in the
mountains and rain in the valley, little
fighting of moment has taken pliMf.
Continuing their offensive in Gra
tia, the Austro-Germans according to
both Berlin and Vienna, have taken
trenches over a front of H miles from
the Russians and made prisoner thirty
ofiicers and 1,900 men. West of
Lutsk, in Volhynia, the Russians at
tacked violently many times, but ac
cording to Vienna, were everywhere
repulsed with great losses. In the
southern Carpathians, near Dorna-
watra, additional heights have been
taken from the Russians by the Teu
tonic allies.
In Transylvania the Rumanians
fighting near the border pusses con
tinue tenaciously to hold luck the
Austro-Germans almost everywhere.
In the Uzul valley, they have driven
the invaders back across the Ruman
ian border.
With the occupation of Athens and
Piraeus by marines from the fleet of
the entente powers, and intense situ
ation has arisen in Athens. Great
crowds of royalists have paraded the
streets of the Greek capital cheering
the king and cordons of Greek troops
and marines have been thrown about
the railroad stations, city hall and
other points occupied by the entente
forces to prevent clashes between
them and the royalists. An unofficial
dispatch says Admiral Du Fournet
was hissed by the throngs in tho
streets of Athens and that a detach
ment of French sailors was driven
back by the hostile crowd.
King Constantine in a speech to the
ofiicers of his fleet told them he would
stand by them, no matter what con-
1 secluences might follow their loyalty
