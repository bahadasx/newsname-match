and the meeting was opened by Super
intendent C. E. Blackstock, who clearly
and forcefully stated his object in re
questing such a meeting, the object be
ing to arouse a schoolsspirit in the city.
He gave some very striking instances
to prove the lack of such a spirit, and
the utter ignorancq of the majority of
those who had a cfaild or children in
the schooL- Citing conditions existing,
he told of 'tine parent who was ; even
unaware cf the name of the present

:- Mr. Blackstoc
gwingly of th
stock spoke forcefully and
glowingly of the industry of education,
staling that it was the greatest indus -

a nower in the community.. He then
called upon Miss Bessie Steedman to
act as -chairman, and the meeting was
turned over to the ladies.
The first step was to vote for the es
tablishment of a permanent organiza-
tion to be known as the Parent-Teach- '
ers Association. " The following ladies
were elected as officers: Mrs. L. K.
Barnwell, president; Mrs. J. S. Brown,

second vice-president; Mrs. T. W.. Val
entine, treasurer, and Mrs! J. Mack

Splendid Record
Making Votes
For
Carroll P. Rogers
-CARROL.il P. ROGERS.
-" As" the people of Henderson county
are coming to know Carroll P. Rogers
better, as the campaign progresses they
are convinced that the Democratic
party made a wise choice in selecting
film as their candidate for the legisla
ture. . ' - ' ; .. . .
Mr. Rogers is a man of broad expe
dience. Having been born and reared in
the home of a country Methodist circuit
rider, he -early learned to know and
understand the needs of the; country
people. At an early age -her entered
the cotton mill business and. vyhsn. czi
years ago, theT'S'kyland Hosisry Gom-i
pany, one of, the pioneer aud rapst sus- ,
cessful enterprises- of the .couiajyiv?

veloped his business, here to a; point
beyond the dreams of the promoters,
and incidentally is giving to Hender-
son county a pay roll of $1250.00 per
week, he has by no means been a
slave to his business, but on the con
trary finds much time to think and act
for the public good. When the splen-
did graded school was established at
East Flat Rock, there were none who
worked harder, contributed more liber
ally or offered wiser counsel than Mr. ;
Rogers, and at all times he is standing !
for the promotion of everything which
will -make life more worth living for
the entire community. He is an en
thusiast for good roads, better schools
and better ehurches. -.. . ; -It
is not surprising, therefore, that
receive enough Republican and inde-
pendent votes to make his majority a
safe one.

and continued until well into the after- ;

In view of the fact that the court
house did not begin to hold the im- '

it has been proposed that a large tent
be secured for next year's singing, or ,
some other arrangements made for
seating the crowd. As it was Sunday
many who would have liked to attend" -the
singing were turned away for lack :."
of room. . --.

-'The singing convention which was .
held at the court house last Sunday
was pronounced by those present to be
the best we have ever heai d and it was
due to the efforts of all those who tooiC
an active part in the work.

wish to .thank every one who helped .,
us in any way. We thank the visitors, " - .
we thank the leaders who were so ac

and we would feel ungrateful-if we

so active and faithful in seating the ,
people and aiding us in keeping order
We also thank all who came out and -hope
they feel amply paid for their
trouble. We also thank you .for space ,
in your paper to say these things. n
