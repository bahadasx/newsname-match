WILLIAM P. WARNER
Republican candidate for Congress,
3rd district, Nebraska-48 years
in the county. Efficient in every
thing he has undertaken
a prosperous bachelor of Daily
township owning an improved 1G0
acrfw of land worth 100.00 per acre
and subject only to a $1,500,00 mor
tgage, through the machinations of
a certain self-ordained guardian
whose magnanimous charity (as he
himself boasts) extends to every
man, woman a;id child in Dixon
county, was induced to exchange
this $11,500.00 equity in the Daily
farm for an old ramshackel hotel
building, worth about $500.00 and
located at Dalis, S. D. .The hotel
building is non-productive and dead
property, and the dead property;
and the poor unfortunate dupe from
the Daily, flimflamed out of approx
imately $11,000.00, is now an object
of sincere pity and is being cared
for by his relatives at Hubbard,
Nebr., while his pretending friend
guardian puts on airs, rides in his
automobile posing as an honorable
man and is again begging for your
votes. Verily this political nimrod
is fooling the people a long time!

WHY HE'S FOR WARNER;
A lire-long friend of Win. I. Wnrnor,
tho republican cmulldato for congrose,
hi writing to an nniualntnitco recently
In ro ply to a letter of lmiuliy, wroto
n ' follows:
' I liavo known him fioin Infancy.
I liao known him through nil his
graduations from Wllllo Warner, Will
Warner, Hill Wnrnor, Judge Winner,
County Attorney Wnrnor, snnntor
Warner nnil Unitoil States Marshal
Warner. I linvo known htm intlmato
ly for nearly half a century, nnd to
day ho la Jii3t as common, lionOBt nnd
dependable ns hqwnn as n boy In
hia teens. Tlioro Isn't n particle of
guile in IiIh mako-up. Ilia woll known
geniality, frnnknosH and npproachabll
ity endear lilm to all who know him.
Tlio years linvo dealt kindly with lilm
ns he deserves, and today, n man
ro years of age, lie possesses a broad
and varied knowlodgo gathered In his
active nnd useful career. I have soon
him work on his farm, which ho loves
second only to his family; obsorved
him nieto out even-handed justice ns
a judge: hoard him fearlessly proso
( uto evildoers; honfd him in tho. sen
ate at Alncoln, and met him fre
quently dirlng hlj term ns United
States v 'inj, and I want o say
to yoi, o has been a success In
evory , -n 1 liavo montlonod.
Kvery thing no undertakes Is accom
plished with dexterity and dispatch
Tils work In tlio stato senate was a
source of prhlo and" satisfaction to
his frloiub nnd his accomplishments
there, and tlio lnwniaking oxporlanoo
he acquired, nro a guarantco that ho
would bucomo a power In congress.
Ho is nt once a polished diplomat,
n cultivated gentleman, n shrovd law
maker nnd nn. energetic nnd Intolli
' onl workor who gets results. He Is
big mentally, morally and physically.
Ilo Is gonoious nnd just. Ho Is pre
eminently fair and Impartial. He is
fenileas, yet of such a sympathetic
disposition that ho would walk around
a worm to -avoid stepping on it I
havo known him to tologrnph money
and employ nsslstanco nt Kills Island
to prevent tlio deportation of a poor
Danish girl immigrant for lack of
funds, simply bocauso tho immigrant's
sister, who was n domestic In tho
homo of a noig'ibor, -appealed to him
for help. I know of his having traced
tho young son of a colored scrub
woman In tho federal building In Om
aha nil the way across tho continent
to Snn Francisco nnd up to Sacra
mento simply to nppoaso tho old col
ored mother's anxiety over tho wel
faie of her offspring. Put him in any
a to at Lincoln, nnd mot him fro
among them nil ns a superb specimen
of manhood. Ho's tho sort of man
you tell your troubles to. lip Is tho
fellow you are -looking for ivWl you
need a big brother. Ho's tuo' man
who is both cnpnblo and willing to
givo you wholesomfc advlco and en
coiirngonipnt. llo'll get out of bed nny
night to perform an act of kindness
for another, and ho's a firm nnd faith
ful friend clear through to tlio end.
It's a plensuro and a urivilogo to
support a man llko Wm. P. Warner
for congross, because In doing so yoi)
liavo a feeling of confidence that no
matter who he Is or whore rtio comes
from tlioro will bo no bettor or bigger
man In congress than he."
