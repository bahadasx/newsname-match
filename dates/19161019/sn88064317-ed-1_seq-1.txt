'APJSII FAIR CONTEST
A STATE FAIR FEATURE.
^ ith advance information indicat
I lug that twenty-five parishes will par
1 ticipate, there is every reason to be
! lieve that the 191*5 parish fair contest
at tho Louisiana State Fair, Novem
ber 1 to 6 , will be far superior to all
the previous contes' s in this depart
ment. Several parish fair organiza
tions, including some formed this
year, will be among the exhibitors,
and the rivalry promises to be un
usually keen and interrstmg.
Each parish with an exhibit will be
furnished wtth a booth, 10x20 feet, in
j the Agricultural Building, so that the
exhibits may be attractively arranged
and d'Splaved. Bes ; des forming part
of the parish exhibit in which they
I are shown, individual exhibits may al
so be entered in the general contests
; for premiums offered for individual
displays.
1 One thousand dollars will be dis
tributed among the ten parishes with
th best showing. In addition, the
sum of $100 is given to the parishes
exhibiting but not taking any of the
parish fair prize money for d.^fraylng
expenses. The lucky parishes also re
ceive $50 pxpense money.
The Agricultural Building will be
Increased in size this year, 90 x 110
feet This will insure room for all.
