By United Press.
Athens, Oct 18. (Delayed in trans
mission.) Greek troops are in com
plete control of the situation here and

By United Press.
Washington, Oct. 19. "America's
great prosperity is responsible for the
high cost of living" says Director of
Mints Von Enge'.tr an.
The export trade is bringing an un
precedented quantity of gold to this
country, says thi sofficial. With such
vast demands for goods the rise in
prices is repsonsible for more people
w ho are employed getting higher wag
es and while these workers supply
goods their wages are drawn from the
immense store of gold and they buy
more goods, helping to swell the ab
normal demand.
I Wages have not kept pace with the
increase in prices, the director ad
mits, but he hopes for an altered con
dition in the future. The mints are
working twenty-four hours a day try

With a division of timo agreeable
to both sides, the joint discussions be
tween W. C. Witeher, the anti-Socialist
lecturer of Grandview, Texas, and
Monroe Wright, representative of the
Socialist party, were resumed at Alex
and Naples Wednesday, with large
owds prese-t. at both places. Re-
from Dmocratic sources say
Witcher. cleaned his opponent to a
finish while the Socialists express en
tire catisfaction with the showing
made by their speaker. Dr. Hanna,
of Alex, said, "Witcher trimmed the'in
to a frazzle and then wore6ut the
frazzles."'
As in previous speeches during the
week Witcher assailed what ho de
clared to be the funKmental princi
ples of Socialism, as put forth by the
leaders in the movement, asserting
that- its doctrines were destructive of
th9 state, religion and tho family re
lation, and Wright stood firm in his
declaration that the entire program
of the party was embraced in its plat
form, denying that the views express
ed by the leaders quoted by Witcher
were party principles. Witcher em
phasized a'statement in the resolu
tions adopted by the national Socialist
convention in 1912 to the effect that
the "ethics of Christianity and the
ethics of Socialism" are very different.
This evening the debaters will meet
at Rush Springs and tomorrow after
noon at Minco. On Friday evening
they will clash at the court house in

ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT
OF COTTON IS PICKED
Recent Improvements Make Cotton Com
press Among Best Protected in State
of Oklahoma
Since the opening of the season tie
Interstate Cotjton compress has re
ceived and pressed 2",000 bales against
5,000 bales on the same date last year.
This is the result of tho cotton season
being fully a month in advance of
that oflust year due to the drouth in
August which forced the opening of
tho bolls and brought early cotton.
A difference of opinion exists as to
the percentage of the cotton which has
already been picked in this section. It
Ijas been variously estimated at from
a half to three -fourths of the crop
but in the opinion of C. H. Caneman,
manager of the Interstate Cotton Con.
press company fifty per cent would bq
a conservative estimate. Mr. Cane
man does not believe the reports of
a much larger percentage.
The Interstate compress is the scene
of great activity and with the high
prices of cotton conditions look, ex
ceedingly promising.
At present thsre are between 10,000
and 11,000 bales of cotton in the
sheds which have a capacity of abot
12,000 bales and there are probably
a hundred cars u the yard.
The" "construction of 3 the fire wail
is completed and most of the new
sheds are now up making this one of
the best sheltered compresses in ihe
state. These improvements were
made primarily for the purposo of re
ducing the rate of insurance.
DURBIN TO
FACILITATE
REPORTS
ill Dp the Heavy Work for Election
Supervisors in Connection with Bal
lots Cast by Absent Voters :
The election law which requires
that election officers 'must forward
affidavits and ballots to the counties
where such voters reside, will not
work such a hardship on the inspec
tors in this county as this work will be
facilitated by Judge S. C. Durbin, ,
chairman of the county election board.
Tha law requires the inspectors to im
mediately forward to all counties con
cerned reports on the ballots so cast
which Involves expense and a delay in
being remunerated for the output.
Concerning this and other features of
this law Judge Durbin said today:
"As this law does not appear hi the
pamplet containing election laws
which is sent to the election officers
in each precinct, I am preparing in
structions as well as blank affidavits
to be st-nt out with election supplies.
"If election officers will bring all
such ballots and affidavits when they
return the boxes to the county board
I will be glad to send them out. It is
not easy under the law to collect the
postage and registration fees and I
don't want the inspectors to lose these
items which in the aggregate mean a
considerable sum. Election officers
as it is are underpaid for a very long
and hard day's work."

question of agriculture, although more
than a third of "the entire population
of J.he nation is engaged in agricul
ture. He spoke of the struggles the
American farmer has had. during all
these years to keep things going and
pay usurious interest, and of tha new
situation created for the farmer by
the passage of the Rural Credits Act.
which opens the door of credit to the
farmer on about tho sanje basis an the
railway or manufacturing concern.
The senator briefly outlined some
of the reasons why the average man
ought to be for Wilson as follows
"Because iu the mldt. of a world
war he has kept the peace. ,
"Because hp has. abolished invisible
government
"Because he has reduced the tariff,
to a. competitive basis.
"Because he has secured the adop
tion of a dumping clause to protect
American labor from cut-throat com
petition after the war.
"Because he has secured an income
tax, obliging wealth to share with
want tho burdens as well as tho bless
ings of government.
"Because ho has established a non
partisan tariff commission and is the
friend of legitimate business.
"Because ho has secured tho ustub
llshmont of a Federal Reserve system
dethroning the money trusts and pre
venting panics.1
"Because ho has established a Federal-
Trade Commission to suppress
unfair competition.
"Bee wise he has secured the estab
lishment of a Rural Credits Law,, de
signed to emancipate the farmer from
excessive; interest charges and has
been a real friend to the farmer.
"His administration has established
a system of licensed and bonded ware
houses for the benefit of the farmer
and measures have been passed to es
tablish official standard and grades
of cotton and grain and Iub adminis
tration has placed a stamp of approv
al upon a system of state and federal
highways and his platform promises
the prosecution of plans to render ag
riculture more profitable and country
life more attractive.
"Because he has approved a meas
ure declaring that human labor shall
not be dealt with as a mere commo
dity, and has given his approval to a
measure abolishing the writ of injunc
tion as an istrument of judicial tyr
anny and has secured for the laborer
the right of trial by Jury in case of
constructive contempt
"Because ho approved the Work
men's Compensation Act and the Sea
man's Act which liberates the toilers
of the sea from involuntary servitude.
"Because ho urged the passage and
signed the Eight Hour Act preventing
a nation-wide strike. This act em
bodies the spirit of the Republican
platform of 19n8 the Progressive
platform of 1912, and the Democratic
platform of 1916. and is in accordance
