The Traffic Ordinance
The traffic ordinance passed recently
by the city council and especially
designed to rediicc the chances for ac
cident in which tHe lives of citizens
may be jeopardized and property de
stroyed seems to be receiving very
little consideration at the hands of
automobile drivers Only one or two
instances have occurred in the past two
years in which people have been hurt
in automobile accidents in Jasper but
a number of very narrow escapes have
been had The Btreets of a small town
are generally narrow as they are here
und it is very common for children as
well as grown people to be seen in the
streets and off Uic sidewalks and
crossings but if drivers of cars will
observe the commonest rules of good
sense as incorporated in the ordinance
it is unlikely that serious accidents
will occur
The following are soino of the prin
cipal points in the ordinance
Kvery machine Shall be equipped
with proper brakes in good working
order nnd a suitable bell horn or other
signaling device
Every car shall show at least two
lighted lamps on the front and one on
the rear from one half hour after sun
set to one hulf hour before sunrise
Kvery driver shall slow down his car
und sound his signal when rounding a
corner or approaching a pedestrian
Cars shall not be run In the city
limits faster tharpIC miles an hour
Violation of ariy provision of the
ordinance is punlsiable of a fine not
less than o00 nor more than r0 and
it Is the duty of the city marshal to see
Unit this ordinance is obeyed
Jefferson Highway
Under the head of News and Pro
gress Along the Houte the following
notes by General Manager Clarkson
appear in the October issue of the Jef
ferson Highway Declaration concern
ing stops made1 along the line in this
section
At Sheldon Things seemed to be
quiet at that point when we arrived
every one except Dr 1epplewell was
too busy to meet and talk over Jeffer
son Highway affairs for a few minutes
so we went on our way
At Lamar Barton county has been
well organized for some time and it did
not take long to get results
At Nevada A meeting was held in
the court house The Vernon county
board of directors which up to this time
had consisted of but six persons was
filled by the appointment of W Wain
scott a prominent good roads man
A committee wes appointed to raise
the necessary funds
A feature of the meeting was the
presence of a large delegation from
Barton county the next county
south It had been whispered around
that Barton county would not be able
to qualify for membership in the Jef
ferson Highway Association but the
Barton county boys exploded this by
presenting a full organization and ten
dering a check for the mileage assess
ment
At Jasper A meeting was held at
this point and it did not take long for
the live wires of Jasper to get into
action and qualify Eli Scott was
named as tneir representative on the
Jasper county board
f There were men in this meeting from
other portions of Jasper county who
guaranteed that the rest of the countv
would qualify for theJeilerson High
way
A complete organization is now as
sured on the Missouri side for the Jef
ferson Highway so all parties have
been notified to report their organiza
tion remit their mileage and get the
road ready for the relay run in Novem

The Merchant
When all your enshhas faded quite
And your friends aie scarce and your
larders light
Who gives you grub till to morrow
night
The Merchant
Or if you ever farm at nil
And you havent bit of grain to haul
Who carries you till the following fall
The Merchant
And then if the crops are u little slack
You skip out some night never come
back
Who isthc man v ho holds the sock
The Merchant
When debts pile up that you cannot
pay
And vou go through the bankruptcy
court sonic day
Who loses but smiles In the same old
way
The Merchant
When the churchs funds are running
low
Cause the members gifts arc rather
slow
Where do the deacons get the dough
The Merchant
Balls and picnics lodges galore
All take their toll from the general
store
But hell get his reward on that beau
tiful shore
