CENTUALI A, Okla., Oet. IS.
Three bandits today entered the
First National bank of Centralia,
ordered four officials and two custo
mers of tne bank to Ho down on the
floor with their face downward,
rifled the cash drawer and vault of
approximately $8,000 and then locked
the six men in th.o vault and escaped
in :in automobile occupied by a fourth
accomplice
Two of the three robbers who
entered tho bank were armed with re
volvers and the third witli a rifle.
Tho man armed with the rifle stood
guard near the door while tho fourth
remained in the automobile. One of
tho robbers is said to have had his
face blackened.
.Made to I.ic Down.
As one of the bandits stepped to the
counter he leveled a revolver at the
bank officials and commanded them
to lie on the floor with their face
downward. After taking all (lie
money in the cash drawer one of the
men went into the vault and robbed
the safe, placing the loot in a sack.
While the robbery was in progress the
customers entered the hank and they
were compelled to lie on the floor.
When the bandits had emptied the
safe in the vault they commanded the
lour officials and tho two customers
to march into the vault. The vault
door was then locked and the robbers
left the building and Jumped Into the
wading automobile.
A store clerk saw the bandits leav
ing the bank building and, suspecting
robbery, entered the bank and re
leased the six men from the vault. A
posse was then organized and the
audits tracked 12 miles, the trail
finally becoming lost and t lie chase
abandoned.

THE Jitneys have inU. IMtlor
than antagonize the city admin
istration every litneur ill Tulsa went
out of b.isim.'ss at 1- o'cicck last
tdsht. The new ordinance limiting the
number of passengers to be carried
by a lni'.v at anv time to two more
than the registered opacity of the
car became cfieitive at that time.
This irorning hundreds of persons
ii hi have been accusicioed to rule
down town in jitneys will be c, mi
ddled to either no afoot to the bosi
Iks., district or walk io the nearest
K'reet car line. .Ins: how long the
demonstration of tie jitney driwis
will last is problematical as they say
it decptuis upon the nambcr and
force of protests lodged with the com
missioners. A contest of the jitnev ordinaice
will not be made In the courts as
previously threatened by the jitney
men. Instead they believe a suspen
sion of all Jitney set" ice will have
r. uieater effect on the city coiuniis
sioners. A parade of all the jitney
through the down-town streets will bo
held till.', morning.
Hope that a peaceable policy would
pain more than an upon fight against
the ordinance was given the Jitney
operators yesterday In conferences
Mayor PbTimons and Finance Commis
sioner Hrink. According to the Jitnev
men they were told that a new or.
din'.nce may lie cons-dered by the
eon inissioners.
Destroys lliislncss.
Operators of jitneys declare that
the ordinance passed last Frid:y
solutelv destroys their business. He
sides limiting the number of passen

I ermil them to operate at a profi',
the ordinance provides other restric
tions. All diivers are reunired to pay
an annual license fee nf $7.". paab"
penii-annually and pass a physical ex
amination. At a meeting of the Jitney union
Monday night it was decided to apply
for an injunction to restrain city
officials from enforcing the new ordi
nance. The matter hung fire all Tues
day and part of Wednesday, but yes
terday noon an agreement was reach
ed not to apply for the restraining
order.
"We believe the citizens of Tulsa
want the jitneys," said Secretary Carl
Mnupin of the Jitney union last night.
"It Is impossible for us to operate
our ears and not lose money under the
regulations of the new ordinance," ho
added.
81 Cars in City.
There are 84 jitney cars in Tuls.i
and more than one hundred drivers
are engaged in the work. One-fourth
of the jitneys run on Admiral boule
vard. Among the other districts served
are North Main and v irth Denver,
Itostnn and Maple Kidge, Carson,
South Denver und West Tulsa.
The jitney men believe stopping all
of their cars will be the most effective
means of combating the new regula
tion. They expect a prompt protest
to the citv commissioners from tho
persons who will be inconvenienced by
the discontinuance of the jitneys.
The Jitney question will probably
come before the commissioners again
at the meeting tomorrow morning. All
of the Jitnours are planning to attend
and they say they will have a delega
tion of citizens there to protest so that
there will remain no doubt In the
minds of the commissioners that tho
Jitneys are really wanted.

MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Oct. 18.
Rev. C. L. Hall of North Dakota, for
two score years a missionary on tho
Fort I'.erthold reservation, declared In
an address before tho Ameriean Mis
sionary association today that the
Indian and white races will bo com
pletely merged through IntermurriaEO
within the next nrty years.
"Despite tho fact that tho Indian,
birth rato is rising una tho death rate
falling off, 1 bcllevu that the Indian
race will have disappeared fifty year
from now," tho speaker said,
"Intermarriage between wliltcs and
reds rapidly is Increasing and with the
absence of tho stigma which attaches
Itself to Inttrniarrlagu of certain other
races. Tho only objectionable feature
lies in the fact that many whites are
n, allying Indians to obtain tlu.lr
shaics of tribal wealth, lint this, too,
Is hurrying tho amalgamation."
