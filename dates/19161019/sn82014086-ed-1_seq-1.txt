charest war office asserts that the
troops of King Ferdinand at various
points have repulsed the attacks of
the Teutonic- allies, inflicting heavy
losses on them and capturing num

Prices of Wheat
Are Ascending
ADVANCED 12 CENTS A BUSHEL
IN TWO DAYS.
HIGH RECORD SINCE 1898
Broadly Active Foreign Buyers, Short
age in Crops iu Unithed States and
Canada and Drouth in Argentina
' Are Among the Contributory Causes
Chicago, Oct. IS. Wheat prices ran
up excitedly almost five cents a bushel
today on top of a seven-cent advance
the day before. All high records were
excelled since 1833, when for a time
Joseph Letter seemed to have cfotained
control of the entire existing surplus
supply.
Foreign Buying Chief Reason.
(Broadly active foreign buying of
future deliveries appeared to be 'the
chief reason for today's violent upturn
which, however, in the end was not
well maintained. The market closed
excited at the same as yesterday's fin
ish to 3 1-4 higher, with December at
16 to 166 3-8, and May at 167 1-8 to
167 1-4.
Short Crops in U. S. and Canada.
Shortage in the wlieat crops of the
United States and Canada was further
accentuated today by increasing alarm
over the Argentine drought and in re
gard to the premature stoppage of
threshing in Canada. Reliance on Ar
gentina to make up largely for the de
ficit in the United States and Canada
seemed to be fast disappearing and the
best advices today from Canada cast
doubt on whether, owing to interfer
ence from snowstorms, the amount of
threshing would 'be even half of what
should be accomplished this fall. Be
sides, estimates were current that 28
to 54 per cent, of the spring crop in
the United States was unfit for mill
ing and that 61 to 81 per cent, of the
winter crop was already out of the
hands of farmers.

Prospects of End
of Bayonne Strike
STANDARD OIL CO. TO CONSIDER
DEMANDS OF STRIKERS
IF MEN RESUME WORK
Superintendent Hennessey Has Sub
mitted Proposition to the Federal
Conciliation Commissioners Terms
Contingent Upon Men Working.
Bayonne, N.. J., Oct. 18. Prospect
of a settlement of the strike of Stan
dard Oil workers, marked by battles
between the strikers and police, with
loss of life, were in view tonight. The
Standard Oil company was authorita
tively reported to be ready to consider
favorably the demands of the men for
higher wages, provided they would first
return to work.
Early Adjustment Expected. -
This became known after John A.
Moffit and James A. Smyth, federal
conciliation . commissioners, had had
conferences with the Bayonne board
of city commissioners and George B.
Hennessey, superintendent of the
Standard Oil plant. After their talk
with Hennessey the conciliatorsan
nounced that he "had shown a concil
iatory attitude" and they looked "for
an early adjustment of the difficul
ties." Some Advance in Wages Likely.
It was understood that Hennessey
informed them that the Standard Oil
company was prepared to deal with
the men only on the same terms under
which the strike of a year ago was
settled, namely, that they first return
to work, after which their demands
would be considered. He also inti
mated, it was understood, that as was
the case last year, some advance in
wages was likely to be granted. The
present wage for most workers is $2.20
a day, it is said.
Hennessey's preposition will be
placed by the federal officials before
the strikers' committee of ten at' a
meetir.g with the city commissioners
tomorrow morning.

NOT A VOTE FOR WAR.
Says It is Merely a Vote for Mainte
nance of American Rights.
Kalamazoo, Mich., Oct. 18. Charles
E. Hughes told an audience in the
armory here tonight that a vote for
him, far from being a vote for war,
meant a vote for the maintenance of
American rights, and that when Amer
icans went abroad lawfully to further
American enterprise they should go
with "backing of the American gov
ernment." The nominee assailed the adminis
tration for its foreign policy, for its
claim that it had aided business, for
the Underwood tariff, for alleged fail
ure to observe the merit system in
making appointments and for extrava
gance. He declared the present pros
perity of the country temporary and
due to the European war. The federal
reserve bill, he said, giving credit
where credit was due," was largely
the result of the report of the republi
can monetary commission and con
tained "defects which should be re
moved."
