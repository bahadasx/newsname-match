BLACK KKFU3KI) TO
OBKY COMMAND
Aft'T Firing Shot Young Man
Surrendered to Sheriff at
West Point.
On last Monday Mr. Drew Foote,
a popular young man of thin city,
shot William Harris, a negro laborer,
the shooting having occurred upon
the plantation of Mr. Foote's sister,
Mrs. Sidney Cox, in the Tibhee
neighborhood, and having followed
recalcerant action on the part of the
negro when told to go to work.
It seems that for some time past
Mr. Foote had been helping his sis
ter in looking after the laborers on
the place and had occasion to repri
mand Harris for laziness. He went
to the house of the negro, and, ac
cording to reports, called him out
and told him that he must do better.
The negro, instead of receiving the
command in a respectful fanner,
became insolent and surly, having
addressed to the young white man
words which no negro should use to
wards a superior. After having in
dulged in language which was highly
disrespectful, Harris started back
in his house, and Mr. Foote, think
ing that he was going after a wea
pon, whipped out his own revolver
and shot him. It is understood that
the bullet passed through the body
of the negro, causing a painful
wound. It is not believed, however,
that this wound, will prove fatal.
The plantation on which the dif
ficulty occurred is located in Clay
county, and after having shot the
negro Mr. Foote went to West Poir.N

ARRIVE FOR LOCAL
HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE
CITY AND WILL START
RUNNING SUNDAY.
The three new trolley cars order
ed some time ago by the Columbus
Railway, Light and Tower Company,
have reached the city and are now
in the barns of the company on Col
lege street, where they are placed
in order with the view of having
them make their first run Sunday.
The three cars are new and mod
ern in every respect, being equipped
with double truck, general electric
motors and are electrically lighted
and heated. They are unusually at
tractive in appearance, being painted
olive green with gilt lettering and
trimmings.
The company is making improve
ments not only in its electrical
equipment, but in its gas plant. The
new compressor has arrived and is
now being installed, while the mains
are being thoroughly overhauled and
placed in first class condition. A
portion of the new turbine genera
tor, which was ordered for the elec
tric light plant, has been received
and will be placed in position as soon
as the remaining parts arrive.
Mr. R. B. Claggett, the efficient
general manager of the company
and Mr. Charles Hays, the local
manager, are doing everything pos
sible to improve the service and
please the patrons of the company.
Mr. Claggett showed the new cars
to newspaper representatives yester
day, and took them for a short joy
ride in order that they might see how-
easy and comfortable these cars ride

lirad of Animal Sent to Che
ists at A. & M. College For
Examination.
Activities on the part of a rabid
canine have caused widespread con
sternation, alarm and suffering in
the Steens neighborhood, twenty-one
persons who were bitten by the ani
mal having been sent to the Pasteur
Institute in Montgomery for treat
ment. It seems that the dog began
promiscuous attacks on people in the
neighborhood several days ago and
bit more than twenty of them before
he was finally killed. After the ani
mal had been shot his head was re
moved and sent to State Chemist
Hand at the Starkville institution,
where an examination revealed the
fact that the dog was badly afflicted
with rabies.
As soon as this news reached
Steens the persons who had been
bitten by the dog went to Montgom
ery for treatment. There is no Pas
teur Institute in this state, and Mis
sissippians who suffer ravages on the
part of rabid canines are always
compelled to go to either Montgom
ery or New Orleans for treatment.
The capital of Alabama is nearer
Steens than is New Orleans, and
hence the victims went to Montgom
ery for treatment.
A special from Montgomery states
that this is the largest number of pa
tients to visit the Pasteur Institute

GREEKS THRONG STREETS

LANDING OF ALLIED MA
RINES IN THE CITY.
Athens, via London, Oct 18.
Marines from the ships of the en
tente powers to the number of about
a thousand have been landed at' Pi
raeus and have occupied the railway
station at Pireus and several build
ings in Athens, immediately this
became known the streets of Athens
swarmed with Greeks, frantically
cheering King Constantine and
chanting the Greek national anthem.
Great crowds marched through the
streets, thousands gathering in the
neighborhood of the postoffice.
The situation appears to be dang
erous. Admiral Uu rournet, com
mander of the entente allied fleet in
the Mediterranean, was hissed, and
a detachment of French sailors was
driven back by a hostile crowd.
A procession of same 4,000 mal
contents, headed by the Greek and
American flags, stopped outside the
American legation, protested against
the landing of foreign marines ami
demanded the protection of the
American minister, who was absent.
The demonstrators then paraded
the streets, singing the Greek nation
al anthem.
The war minister, Gen. Dracos, or
dered out Greek troops and marines
to guard every approach to the
square in order to prevent any clash
between Greek civilians and tho
French, who occupied that section,
establishing a complete cordon about
the French and taking all precau
tions to avoid any incident or acci
dent capable of starting strife. 11

GOOD RESULTS OBTAINED BY
CIVIC IHVEINT LEAGUE
MRS. WILLIAM BALDWIN WILL
CONTINUE TO BE PRESI
DENT OF LEAGUE.
At d meeting at the Chamber of
Commerce last Friday, the Civic Im
provement League closed the first
year in its history. The following
officers were elected for the coming
year: President, Mrs. William Bald
win; vice-president, Mrs. J. W. Lips-'
comb; secretary, Mrs. Berton Lin
coln. Preceding the election of of
ficers, the president reviewed brief
ly the work of the year just ended,
in substance as follows:
"Realizing that good sanitary con
ditions are a prime necessity, the
League has, through its department
of health and sanitation, made the
attainment of such conditions its
first consideration. To this end, it
has conducted two clean-up cam-j&ii'jkfiift,-last-
fall, 4 and - more
thorough and far-reaching one the
past spring in conjunction with the
Chamber of Commerce. We were
instrumental in securing the services
of Dr. Walley, state health inspector,
as a result of whose visit the League
entered the state contest for the
cleanest town. To arouse interest
in this contest, four preliminary
meetings were hold in various parts
of the town, including one for the
colored people. Slides were run at
the picture show. City ordinances
bearing on sanitary matters were
compiled and published in the local
papers. And in addition t- the six
regular ward committees, ten inspec
tion committees were appointed and
diil active work. While local condi
tions over which we had no control
made it impossible to win in this con-
test, we feel that Columbus had the
best cleaning it has ever experienced.
And we point to two new city ordi

run far away from those cast for the i

quantity.
The other parties have no nomi

supreme court judge, though the So

the usual scattering vote, and Rep

Governor Theo. G. Bilbo has writ

from the men. This matter was
brought up before an interesting

H. A. Lincoln, who was presiding, ap
pointed the following committee to
solicit funds: Messrs. Beverly Mat
