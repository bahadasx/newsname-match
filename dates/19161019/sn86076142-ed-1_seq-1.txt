tenance of peace along the frontier.
Tbia statement also Included argu
ment designed to show why tbe
American troopa should be withdrawn
from Chihuahua.
Tbe Mexicans insist they are capa
ble of driving Villa and other out
law away from the border, but the
American attitude 1 that he must
demonstrate ability to do more than
that. The Americans Insist that any
