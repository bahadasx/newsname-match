EXTRAVAGANCE SPOILS
AND INHUMANITY MARK
WILSON'S RULE
Not Republicans alone, but Demo
crats as well, realize and have voiced
the extra vagence of the Wilson ad
ministration, calling attention to one
of its most vulnerable points, fiut
added to the Democratic raid on the
treasury, there are the raids on the
civil service, the indorsment of the
spoils system, a criminal policy in
Mexico, that has caused the death of
5'JO Americans, nnd the destruction of'
the homes and property of 20,000
mute and the encouragement of
armed banilitry and outrages.
At. t!u* rate ttie present administra
tion is going, the appropriations foi
the filth Congress will amount
*4,220,368,905, practically the cost ot
the "ntire Civil War. The largest
sum ever expended by a Republicai
administration was in the last year ol
th:it war when it used $1,295,093,289.
How the North Pays
lJut tiie Kxit'h in the saddle has seer
to it that I In South was kindly ex
i-tnptcd from the weight of these taxes.
Some comparisons of the Democratic
inti-mal revenue burden placed on
Not the I'll states are .shown below:
•State Wealth Tax
Georgia ci: .2S2,fiX», iOO $ 051,570
Coinucticul 2,2«t5,154,fi59 1,123.038

Mississippi 1,344.860,020 146,888
Montana 1,149,732,986 247,006
'l'lio list is 'on)?, but throughout
sliou thpse comparisons as between
Northern and Southern states. Wil
son stands for spoils.
In his first year as president, Mr.
W iI so.il signed four acts which au
thorized government appointments
mtsidi! the civil service. The Civil
Service Reform League, of which he
vas once a vice president, urged him
not to sign the worst one of these bills
out he refused, and later this great
national, non-political organization
criticised him in its annual report.
Kelp "Deserving Democrats"
And as further corroboration of the
vholo attitude of the administration
towards this subj"d we have Mr. Bry
in's famous letter, part of which is as
follows:
"M,v Dear Mr. Vick: Now that you
have arrived and are acquainting
yourself with the situation, can ycu
I't me know what positions you have
at your disposal with which to reward
deserving Democrats? Wheneveryou
desire a suggestion from me in regard
to a man for any place there call on
tie. You have had enough experi
ence in politics to know how valuable
workers are when the campaign is on
and how difficult it is to find suitable
rewards for all deserving.*** W.
.T.
liryan.
Wilson's Foreign Policy
Out it is when one turns to his for
eign policy that one realizes the
short
comings that have characterized
President, Wilson's administration.
We lifted the embargo and put arms
into the hands of savages. Americans
and other nationalities, and especial
ly helpless and peaceable Mexicans,
were subjected to ail the horrors of
uucivilizod warfare. Neither sex nor
condition of non-combatants was re
spected, but all alike, iittie girls,
women, tottering old men, fell victims
to the lust and brutality of rival fac
tions.
At Durango in spite of the protest
of the American Consul, and without
any objection from our government,
the city was givtm over by the consti
tutionalist general to the unrestrained
license of his soldiers for 24 hours.
American women were gathered in
MacDonald's institute where their
husbands barricaded the building and
fought to preserve them from rapacity
of rebel soldiers.
Extort Promissory Notes
And then to cap the infamy, after
Americans had been abandoned to
their fate, and ordered to get out of
Mexico the best way they could, Mr.
Wilson's government extracted prom
issory notes from them, payable to
Mr. Bryan, for transportation home,
charging them 8 per cent, and fur
nished only steerage. Is it any won
der the honor of America has perished
before the world.

How Catarrh Is Contracted
Mothers are sometimes so thought
less as to neglect the colds which
their children contract. The inflama
tion of the mucus metnbrare, at first
acute, becomes chronic and the child
has chronic catarrh, a disease that is
seldom cured and that may prove a
life's burden. Many persons who
have this loathsome disease will re
member having had frequent colds at
the time it was contracted. A little
forethought, a bottle of Chamberlain's
Cough Remedy judiciously used, and
all this trouble might have been
avoided. Obtainable everywhere.—

HOPE SMASHES TOWER
CITY'S LINE FOR SECOND
VICTORY OF THE SEASON
Tower City Unable to Stop Progress
of Ooc Morton's Trench Busters
At three o'clock Saturday af
ternoon a fair sized crowd was
on hand at the iocal gridiron to
see the battle between the High
School teams of Tower City and
Hope.
The outcome of the game was
not long in the dark after the
kick-off by the visitors. Hope
started to march down the field
with the ball and did not stop
until they had carried it across
the visitors' goal line, not only
once but three times before the
game ended. The visitors were
on the defensive most of the
time but in the third quarter
they had the ball on Hope's five
yard line but were held for
downs and lost their only oppor
tunity to score. The final score
was Hope 19, Tower City 0.
As a team the home boys
showed great improvement over
their play against Coopers
town
the week previous, getting their
plays off with more snap and
smoothness. Sussex was the
star of the game making gains
time and again through the line
and on end runs. McClellan
showed up well in his tackling
and Stevens made some good
gains around the end. The
combination of Carpenter, Full
mer, Dowling and Reynolds in
the line were also responsible
for a share of the victory as they
opened up some big holes for
the runners. "Shorty" Ray
at quarter was on the job all the
time and used good head work in
running the team. Joslyn, H.
Ray and Rone.v also did their
share of good work.
Several attempts were made
at forward passes but none of
them were successful, altho the
plays were pulled off nicely and
the passes good. On this feature
the work in the Cooperstown
game was much better.
Coach Morton has the boys
hard at work again this week
getting in shape for the game
next Saturday and if everything
goes right there may be a mid
week game following. The big
game of the season is set for
November 4th when Casselton
will come to Hope.
