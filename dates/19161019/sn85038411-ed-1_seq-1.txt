Question of Panic in Case of
Fire Causes Grave
Concern
Stroll through the Central high
vchool halls and recitation rooms most
any time, Mr. Citizen-Taxpayer, if you
would obtain some real inside infor
mation as to whether or not Harris
burp: should provide some immediate
relief for the really uncomfortable
congestion of student accommodations.
To date the total Central high school
enrollment is 1,048; the building has a
capacity for caring comfortably for
about 600.
That the big student body must be
divided into two groups, one to study
during the morning session, the other
to recite during the afternoon session,
is pretty generally known to Harris
burg folks. Just how the great body
of pupils are crowded into the rooms,
however, probably isn't so well known.
T'nder present conditions it is not
only impossible to hold a ma.ss meet
ing of Central boys and girls, but
chapel sessions for the entire school
are an impossibility; the great assem
bly room has long since been cut into
two portions and the partitioned sec
tion is subdivided into a couple of
recitation rooms.
How Tlicy Struggle Through
Furthermore, faculty meetings with
everybody present are an impossibility
except once in about six weeks or two
months. Professor H. G. Dibble, the
principal, tries to overcome this diffi
culty by holding departmental gather
ings. laboratories are used for reci
tation and study rooms; it is not un
common for an algebra class to try to
work out its problems amid the retorts
and appliances of the chemical "lab";
the library has long since been turned
into a recitation room and study hail;
every room, every period of the day.

safe was demolished by an overcharge

bandits obtained a loot of 110,000, but
tills was based on conjecture.
Railroad men and sheriffs of long
experience in this territory said the
robbery was one of the boldest they
ever knew, and except for bungling
work in opening the express safe, prob
ably would have been ascribed to ex
perts. Six men participated in the
robbery, flagging the train at a deso

two guarding the train crew, who had'
been forced to uncouple the engine,
express and mall cars and run them a

others standing sentinel at the rear
car. while the remaining two attended
to the treasure safes. Their work

Brown Advises Making
Contributions to Crow
"As far as T am concerned, I havo
been advising everyone who asks mo
about it to make contributions to Re
publican State Chairman William E.
Crow," said Attorney General Brown
this morning when asked about con
tributions for the Republican state
campaign.
"Thut is my position and I have told
everyone who lias talked to me about
it It is up to the people themselves,
Hit I have been telling them to whom
to pay."
Mr. Brown said, in reference to the
long delay in presenting the appeal of
the Philadelphia anthracite rate case
to the Dauphin county court: "I have
been trying for weeks to get this mat
ter into some shape for action. N'ot
having been counsel from the start, I
have been handicapped, and my in
torniation is that the record was not
even substantially complete until this
summer. 1 have conferred with attor
neys and urged that action be taken to
get the matter before the court. In
my opinion, public interest demands
an early determination of the matter
and I want to see something done. It
has been complicated from the begin
ning and it should be straightened
out."
