FOG COULDN'T DIM SUCCESS
OF COUNTY'S PRIZE FAIR
Fog, a faint drizzle and a drooping thermometer did their best
to keep the citizeus of Whatcom County away from the Sixth Annual
Fair at Lynden last week, but with less success than Ford had In
ending the European War. The grounds were generously filled each
day, and on Friday, gate receipts in a larger amount than ever before
pour e ,j into the sirong-box of ihe fall treasurer.
Tte lard, cold totals of the attendance figures fall considerably
below those of 1915, but increased revenue at other points will make
t'. is ye&r'i Fair but a few hundred dollars less profitable thau that
<>f last year.

especially noteworthy.
