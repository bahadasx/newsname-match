"It Is always a pleasure for a mayor

This semi-arid land of ours may
seem barren, but it has tremendous
potentialities. I believe from your
work, that sometime, where the mes
quite is king, the country will be
peopled with happy, thriving farmers.

that country is getting on dangerous

Strong Arm in Mexico.
There can be no peace in Mexico
until the people are made to under
stand the strong arm of the Law. Had
this strong arm been shown four years

trouble. We are looking for a day
when a new Americanism will be born.

"It affords me pleasure to welcome

Loss of the German submarine
merchantman Bremen virtual
ly was conceded today by ranking Ten
tonic diplomats in position to be fa
miliar with the movements of the ves
sel. The Bremen is now one month
overdue.
It has been about two months since
the Bremen is supposed to have left
Germany for the United States. She
was a sister submarine of the Deutsch-
land which made the Atlantic Dassage
successfully, returning to Germany
with a cargo after having brought one
to the I'nited States.
The Bremen has been reported cap
tured by the British, but the report has
lacked confirmation from official
sources. The supposition now is that
she perished at sea with all on board.
The Ieutschland is now reported pre
paring for another journey to the

It was admitted that German offi

know is that she set out for America

have arrived at an American port soon

WAR WILL LAST ANOTHER YEAR

Germans, Who Before the Somme Thrust Expected Peace
in the Autumn, Now Realize Foes Are in the War to
Eight to a Finish British Officers Say That, With
Resources Known, Victory Can Be Calculated.
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE. Oct.
IS (via London. Oct. 19.) The
war will last another year, ac
cording to the concensus of opinion
among the British soldiers and their
leaders. It is also the opinion of the
Germans. If the views of prisoners
count for anything. Before the
grand offensive started, a high
authority informed the correspondent
of The Associated Press that the Ger
man line would not be broken this
summer and that slow operations,
wearing down the Germans, would be
inaugurated and would probably last
through another summer. This officer,
speaking of the situation today, said:
"We know what the German re
sources were and what ours were and
the time required to force a decisive
victory for our arms is a matter of
calculation."
Klght to a FlnUh.
German prisoners taken during the
summer invariably spoke of peace be
ing a certainty in the autumn. They
regarded the Somme thrust as a final
effort of the allies for a decision and
that after, it peace would be made.
Their tone has been entirely different
of late.
They recognize that it Is a fight to
a finish between the man power and
resources of the two foes and that an
ultimate decision will come from the
attrition on the western front which
now will know no intermission until
the end. The Germans are determined
to make every village on the western
front a fortress which will yield only
when reduced to powder by shell fire

Tuesday and was on her way to Lon

time this morning.
The Alunia sailed from this port

At a period when the weather is ad

mans are apparently concentrating ev
ery possible man and gun against Ru

The view of the British officers Is
that the Germans hope to crush Ruma
nia so that when they have to face a
common allied offensive In the spring
they may not have to defend the im
mense length o fthe Rumanian frontier
in addition to what tbey have had to
defend this summer.
Morale of German Varies.
It is a universal remark among the
British that never has the morale of
the prisoners varted more than now.
"You will notice that we are always
taking prisoners and that the Germans
get very lew of ours, said a start of
ficer. 'Though small parties of our
men are bound to get into hazardous
positions in this kind of intricate op
erations, at close quarters, they die
rafher than yield. This shows their
morale and the te.nper
of the tritua-
tion.
