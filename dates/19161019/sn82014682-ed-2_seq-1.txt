Report Will Tell Whether
Damage is Serious
That the Mat son steamer Lurline,
which bumped her stern on a sub
merged rock off Makapuu Point at
3:25 Wednesday morning, may have
to go to San Francisco for repairs,
without taking" any passengers or
freight was considered likely byi port
authorities today, who are inclined to
believe the damage done the steamer's
hull more serious than was consid
ered yesterday.
The Lurline is due to steam for San
Francisco at noon Tuesday. If she
has to go to San . Francisco without
any passengers or freight it will up
set the Matson schedule and heighten
the local congestion in canned pines
awaiting shipment to the coast as
well as Increasing still further the con

Wireless "Message to Star
Buiietin Tells of Anxiety
of Candidates"
TERRITORIAL SECRETARY
SAYS NO NEED TO WORRY
Document Issued 0. K. and
Copy Mailed Yesterday;
Date Not Important
Maui officials and candidates are
excited because the governors elec
tion proclamation had not been re
ceived on the Valley Isle up to this
mcrning and fears were held that an
election on November 7 without tho
gubernatorial proclamation would be
invalid.
This situation, brought out by a
wireless message to the Star-Bulletin
thlB morning, does, not excite either
the governor or Territorial Secretary
Thayer, " who looks after arrange
ments for the proclamation. It ap
pears that the election was 'duly pro
claimed, though the Valley Isle baa
not yet been officially informed of it.
Maul's anxiety is related in the fol
lowing wireless message, from the
Star-Bulletin's correspondent:
: "WAILUKU, Maui, Oct 19. Offi
cials and candidates fear governor has
failed to Issue the election proclama
tion. Not received here.. Time for
It has elapsed. Candidates much ex
cited, think; validity of election af

Secretary Wade Warren Thayer
taid today that . Governor Pinkham's
proclamation - was Issued : oft ? Septem
ber: 26, the day that the governor m
turned from his' trip to the Civic Con
vention at Hllo, being the first act
that was performed by the executive
on his arrival at the office.
A wireless message to the governor
while at-Hllo had been sent by Mr.
Thayer asking if he would return in
time to sign the proclamation, ain
offering to send the document to him
If he wished to prolong his stay.
"Maui people are ' unduly, excited."
said the secretary this morning wnen
told of the report by the Star-Bulletin.
"The proclamation was sent'from this
office on Tuesday last, wnicn wouiu
put it" on the Mauna. Kea yesterday
morning.- By this time the document
is undoubtedly in the Valley Island.
"It does not make any difference
whether the proclamation is sent at
a certain time or not. Of course, the
sooner the better, but no definite date
is set for sending It out.
Joseph P. Mendonca has called a
meeting of the residents of Smith,
between Beretania and Queen streets,
along which strtet th board of super
visors is planning to form an improve
ment district to discuss the matter
at the office of C. Eolte, 810 Kaahu
manu street, and which was to be
held at 3 o'clock this afternoon. The
public oearing Is set for October 26
to .hear protests against the improve
ment district -
In his letter to the residents, Men
donca says:
"Regarding, the extension of Smith
street from King street to Queen
street and the paving of Smith street
from Beretania street to Queen
street .the supervisors at first pro
posed to have this in two parts.
"City Engineer Collins proposed to
me, through my representative, that
the Dowsett land and some of the
Magoon and Gilliland land be bought
for $19,935-r-and the land owners on
Smith street should bear two-thirds,
of this expense, 13,290-amounting to
$4.84 per front foot to be paid by all
iana owners on ouuin tsireei arum
Beretania to Queen street
"By simply removing the back fence
from the Dowsett land a roadway from
King street - to jQueen street will, be
open, but the roadway is not paved.
"Later on the supervisors changed
their minds and now they propose that
the buying; of the land and paving of
Smith' street from King street to
Queen street and repaving of Smith
street from Beretania street to King
street shill be thrown together, at the
combined expense of $13.29 per front
foot payable by the land owners."
Mendonca then gave a list of ihe
residents, totaling 20, with the assess
ment of each at the front foot charge
of $13.29, the combined assessment
being $28,874.
