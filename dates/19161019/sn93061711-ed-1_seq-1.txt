U CANDIDATE FOB
ii. O. Rurstim, Messrs. Wngner, niul
f.itul.-tiiy woru here lust Thursday night
ami spoko before a fair sized audience
at the Opera House that night
while on their trip through tlie east
ern part of New Mexico.
Asst. District Atty. I'liillips, now the
Rcpuhlicnn candidate for district at
torney spoke ntid bragged on his rec
ord as assistant in this district. Said
he had taken tt stand on every ques
tion and will endeavof to perfotm the
duties of that office to the best of hi
ability, if elected. He said President
Wilson promised to cut down the high
cost of living and he hadn't done it.
therefore he was not truthful and he
s hould lie repudiated. He did not be
lieve the war in fctiropo was the cause
f the present high prices. Nothing
could cause them hut a democratic
: -resident. He was mad becau.-e .Mr.
Wilson was running for the second
term after saying he was in tavor df
making the president's oflice hut one
term and that for six years instead of
four. He thinks this honorary office
should be passed around since Presi
dent Wilson was supposed not to run
for the second term.
Prof. Warner, of Kanta Fe, follow
ed with a pleasing address. He is the
Republican candidate for State Super
intendent of schools. He claims, as a
.umber of others claim, that that olllce
hould be non-partisan, that his posi
tion is not partisan. His speech, un
like Mr. Phillips, dealt with the pros
purity of the country, especially with
Tew Mexico at this time. He never
mentioned the hard times, high cost
"f living nml the panics that were
' omul to come if Wilson were ro-clecl--
d. Prof. Warner said he was ospce
i illy interested in the boys and girls,
ut of course he likes the fathers who
may choose to vote for him. Ifc visit
ed the Tucumcari schools Thursday
and thinks we should feel proud of
them. He is not in favor of any mem
ber of the tax commission or any oth
er commission snyini: how many and
how to build our public school build
ings and any town or community
hould be allowed to build all the
chools they desire and not hampered
l-y anyone, that if elected he would
'.ami on guard of the nuances as far
as the state is concerned, and each dis
trict could expect impartial treatment.
Of course Prof. Wanner is a republi
can, aifd he was speaking to an audi-
nee largely composed of democrats,
o it did not give him a fair chance to
fully extend himself.
Judge Lindsay, candidate for lieut.
governor on the Republican ticket, was
next in line and of course it was up
to him to get up and speak. He was
.II acquainted with the late W. I-'.
Ituchanan. former president of the In-
'rnational Hank of Commerce, and
from his personal acquaintance with
that former citizen of Portales, later
of Tucumcari, he always watched with
grout interest the progress of the town
Mr. Ituchanan played such a great part
in building. Ho did not say whether
he was ever interested in the banking
Ini.siness with Mr.. Huchannn.
Mr. Lindsay said he did not believe
in Union Labor because it look away
the rights of employerscorporations
and men with money to say what
they could atTord to pay their employ
ees. Therefore, he thought the Adam
:on bill was unjust. He said the U.
!'. did wrong by landing soldiers at
Vera Cruz and afterwards did wrong
by removing them before peace was
wholly restored. Ho claimed Uncle
.''am is now at war in Mexico and is
incurring a big expense arming and
further preparing for war, but he did
not say it would cost about the same
to keep the soldiers in the Eastern
States, whore they would not lie ob
taining any new experience and train
ing, as well as protecting the citizen'
along the border from any re-occur-lence
of another Columbus raid.
He said the nominees on the State
Republican ticket were perfect, that
those who choso them took angels
for example and picked the best men
in the state. He said the Democrats
realized this fact and chose their nom
noes accordingly. He is especially
fond of Mr. Hubbell and thinks Mr.
Hughes will need him at Washington
to help run the governmental ntTairs,
as he is a successful sheep raiser and
business man. Ho claimed Hubbell
could and would do no harm as he
would champion anything Mr. Hughes
would desire.
Ho criticized Mr. Walton for not
having nny legislation to his credit
at Santa Fe, for not being able to put
any real live measures through over
the Republican majority. Mr. Walton
admitted this fact when ho was in
Tucumcari, and every other democrat
who was a member of the last legis
lature had the same experience.
Mr. Lindsay closed by saying that
if the pcdplo of New Mexico chose
him as lieutenant governor he would
do no harm.
Mr. Ilursum was then Introduced,
and began his speech by saying that
ho felt fiorry for tbo ladies that ho
GOVERNOR SPOKR HERE
mild not call them fellow citizens. He
doc nut think they are citizens be-eau-o
they are not nllowcd to vote In
New Meico. He said the Rcpiihli
earn were going to give them the right
of uiriage. It took a Democratic
administration four years to show the
RomiM'rnns they were real citizens
and "hould be allowed the right to
vote. He paid a high tribute to wo
men by saying that they were always
-ober, but that the same could not 1 e
"aid of all the men.
Mr. Ilursum. like most politicians,
imply f-ll in love with "the beautiful
city of Tucumcari and the county of
Quay." He did not brag very much on
our "elegant" road", but most of his
speech was in reference to the won
derful road we could Imvc providing
we selected the Republicans to handle
the state mad money
He told of the
good rinds in Colorado, Kansas, Texas
and California. He said New Mexico
: iu-o soil more natural resources than
either of these rtatiM, one of which
i wn the abundant sunshine, which puts
t more -weetness In the sugar beets,
i more nutrition in the grass, etc. The
j scenery of New Mexico is unexcelled,
and is more beautiful than that of
Switzerland or any other country. He
aid the only thing necessnry now was
to hiii'd roads ti this scenery and it
will bring tourists by the thousands
who are composed oi the Host class.
He believes in improving every stnte
highway. (Of course it must be a
real state highway, not a road to the
wheat belt or farming community, just
one for auto tourists). He is in favor
of I ending the state and spending a
million dollars a year on toads. Of
course it will take a few thousand dol
l.irs to keen up these STATE roads.
He proposes to pass a bill if possi
ble whereby the farmer may obtain
"lu-p money on long time, something
like the Rural Credits Hill already ,
jias. e.l l.y emigres just before ad-1
journment
Mr. ISursum said Eastern capital is
upieiniis of irrigation projects, that
the promoters and engineers chnrge
too much to allow the investor to con
.dder the proposition worth while.
He" in favor of establishing an agri
cultural college in every farming dis
trict, but did not say whore all this
money could be obtained to pay for
the erection and maintenance.
The meeting closed after a long nnd
tiresome session. Mr. ISursum may bp
i political boss in his homo county,
nit h" i . not much nf a public speak
r. On another page the Democratic
State committee publishes a three-column
article dealing with road build
ing in Mr. I'ursurn's home county, and
his record as a t:x payer. If all the
citizens of New Mexico paid taxes like
Mr. ISursum there would be less road
money" than is now accessible. Read
these articles before November 7.

SUPREME COURT
DECIDES IN FAVOR
OF JUDGE LEIB
The Towndrow murder trial is no'
drawing much of a crowd as it is too
long and not many citizens know any
thing about it. To hear the Slate'
witnesses one would think it was on
of the foulest crimes ever committed
by a human being. Then to hear tin
other side it puts us to guessing which
is right. Of course right will win. or
it should. If he is guilty, there !-
i no penalty to harsh for him to sttfi'or.
i If he is innocent, he ha.-' been seriott I
wronged. We leave this matter to the
! jin-y. which has been kept together for
more than a week aiiii' from all ap
pearances they will lie together for
several more. It is a good bunch f
citizens from all parts of the county,
and they will mete out justice as fin
is they can. when the time comes.
The State llnished its part of tin
tofctitnnnv Wedne.nlnv. A. .1. An-!--.,.
ton, unikrtakjr, recognized the stove
oker with which it was supposed Mr-
, Towndrow was killed. He also rec
,Kn.Mt the rugs which wero burned,
je ai.l he had known Mr. and Mis
Towndrow for several vcars, that they
, -vu )t,t. ,nsm.jL.,i about -1'. vcars. Sh"
waH )0llt r,(i y,,.,, olt ,;m wm,,
; weigh about 1(10 pounds. When he
,rrivcd the furniture of room was dis-
irranged and the body was lying near
:he door of the dining room. Her body
was badly burned, the clothes nearly
ill burned off the trunk. The floor
ind rugs were burned. She was lying
with her head in vomit, and the vomit
was scorched around the cihro. Mr.
Arlington was one of the best wit-
Messes for the state and gave a vivid
description of the house and lifeless
form of the victim of some one's
wrath.
The case was started last week, but
in account of a writ of prohibition it
was deferred until counsel for State
and Defense went to Santa Fe and so
etircd a hearing from the supreme
.ourt. The following telegram will
fully explain the outcome of that trip:
Santa Fe, Oct. 10. Judge Thomas
I). Leib will continue to hear the cae
if the Slate of New Mexico vs. John
II. Towndrow, of Raton, in district
court in Tucumcari.
This is the decision of the state su
'ironic court which late Saturday
light denied the writ of prohibition to
.es train Judge Leib from continuing.
! he case in which he hnd already sat
I "or two days when the petition for
he writ was Hied. The supreme court
leclined to go into the jurisdiction is
ues involved until the case comes up
n appeal, in case an appeal is taken,
l'he presence of fiO witnesses in Tu
umcari and the selection of the jury
ready to sit in the case, were tal.cn
nto consideration by the court.
It will be remembered that Town
I row, the defendant, hnd obtained a
change of venuo from Raton to Tu
cumcari and Judge Leahy had been
instructed to try the case at the last
term, but on motion of the attorney
for the state, a continuance was grant- ,
ed. When court opened last Monday '
it Tucumcari, Judge Leib called the
Fownilrow case, and proceeded to try !
.t until the defense applied for a writ
of prohibition, based on the chnrge
if prejudice and the order to Judge '
Leahy.
The writ of prohibition to restiain'
ludgc Thomas D. Leib from continu-,
tig the hearing of the case of the '
state vs. Towndrow, charged with ux-1
ireide, at the prerent term of court :
n Tucumcari, was argued Saturday
ifternoon and night before the State !
Supreme court here. State Senator
Irampton and Attorney O. L. I'liillips, I
epresented Judge Leib, and Judge J. '
s'orthcutt, of Trinidad, Attorney Jno. '
dorrow of Raton, and Attorneys Reed i
lolloman and Frank J. Lavan, of tho
'atron & Catron law firm, appeared
.or the commonwealth.

mil a half west of Hudson, occurred
he mnrriago of Miss Maudo Ethel
Holley to Mr. George W. Kncchtly, on
.Vednesday, Oct. 11, nt eight o'clock
'i. m. The bridal pnrty entered the
drawing room from the west living
room, taking their station before n
magnificent Americnn flag, draped at
the east entrance. Thu ceremony was
performed by Rev. Edmund Thomp
son, who used effectively tho ring ser
vice of the Baptist church. The bride
was becomingly gowned in silk moire
done in one of the charming new
shades of brown, with white silk and
'aco trimmings. Tho groom wore tho
conventional black.
At the conclusion congratulations,
-in elaborate three-course wedding din
ner was served. The long table was
tretched tho full length of the dining
room, all the guests being seated nt
once. Mr. Kncchtly hnd his house in
readiness for his bride, and while it
was conceded that the event was 'm
mincnt, it was not generally known
when the wedding ceremony would
take place. The announcement to the
public after the nuptials had been per
formed came as a distinct surprise,
Mr. and Mrs. Kncchtly arc at home
to their friends nt their farm two
miles east of Hudson. Without ex
ception, they have the good wishes
of every resident of that community.
