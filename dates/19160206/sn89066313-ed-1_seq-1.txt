COMMISSION PLAN
HAS FINDS HERE
Poll By Missourian Shows 33
For, 8 Against, 12
Noncommital.
REASONS ARE CITED
Some Contend That Draw
hacks Overcome Advan
tages of New Form.
Pift -three representative citizens,
Iecti d at random, were interviewed
.ste-rdav on the question of commis
sion government "Do ou favor com
mission government?" was the ques
tion in each case.
This is the result of the poll
for oiiiiiiissioii sov eminent .'13
tsulnst (ommission government.. S
ViiuomniittuI or ilnulitful 12
Of course the evidence here is not
ccuicliihive that Columhians want the
new form Another group of the same
number might give vastly different re
sults However, the majority given
liv the persons interviewed esterday
in favor of the commission plan indi
cates that there is at least a strong
sentiment in Columbia favorable to
the new sstem.
Opposition to the present sStem,
the poll indicates, is not based on an
tagonism to the piesent city adminis
tration, or any of its members, but is
directed against the ma or-and-coun-cil
sstcm in general.
In the summary given above only
those are counted in favor of the new
plan who expressed themselves as for
it without qualification. Others, who
thought the plan might work well but
pointed out certain objections, are
listed as doubtful
Whatever else the poll shows, it
proves that Columbians are thinking
about their city government.
The individual opinions follow:
. C. Knight, druggi.xt I think the
commission form of city govern
ment is very good It puts the run
ning of the affaiis of the city in the
hands of business specialists. Each
cit official is directl responsible for
the department under him. Unde
sirable elements may creep in, but the
pubhcitv that naturally follows com
mission government would soon elim
inate these
T. K. Catron, real estate man The
commission form of government for
cities is preferable to the Sstem in
vogue in Columbia. Under our pres
ent sstem, incompetent men are too
often elected The men who best
could till the offices hesitate, or refuse,
to serve on the council. Under com
mission government, efficient business
men would be elected.
II. It. Bush, real estate and insur
anco man In several respects, the
commission form of government is
better than the form in general use
now A commission composed of
three men on a salary could attend to
the citj's business far better than can
a city council. These commissioners
would not consider their political
positions as subordinate to the occu
pations by which they earned their
livings, but as their chief occupa
tions Their whole time and energy
would be given to this work. These
men would represent the city as a
whole, not the various wards which
elected them. With commission gov
ernment, each man would attend to
some branch of the cit's business,
such as light and water, streets and
finances, and, devoting his whole time
to this, he would be able to do his
work much better.
Dr. J. It. Cole, osteopathic phsician
I am in favor of commission form
of government and would vote for it.
Kirksville has it and I think it would
work well in Columbia. The men on
the council are not paid enough. Three
men would be better with more pay.
so that the would devote all their
time to the city.
It. i:. Haiton, wall paper dealer I
am ver much In favor of commission
form of government for Columbia. The
government of the city should be in
the hands of competent men who are
well paid for their time and work I
have been waiting for years for an op
portunitv to vote for commission gov
ernment in Columbia.
s. II. Hakcr. grocer I am not well
informed on the subject of commis
sion government I have been leav
ing that to wiser heads, but if It is
anv thing to benefit the town, I am in
favor of it.
The Rev. C. C. Grimes, pastor of the
Broadway Methodist Church The
government of Columbia should be
placed upon a business rather than a
political basis, and I think the com
mission form would do this. Such a
government would centralize respon
sibility and eliminate the usual prac
tice of shifting responsibility from one
official to another.
Walter T. Ballcnger, linotpe fore
man of E. W. Stephens Publishing
Company I am very much in favor of
the commission form of government
It takes the direction of civic matters
out of partisan politics, which often
puts men in office regardless of their
competency. As a member of the wa
ter and light committee si ears ago,
I was without expert advice and often
had to take that of salesmen. With
Mr. Fawks in charge, the water and
light department is in much better
shape than it was then. It is not that
the men In office do not render the
best service they can, but they are
often conscious of their inability to
handle the matter In the efficient waj
that a trained expert would handle it
While we would have to emplo high
salaried men as managers, I think that
in the long run the commission plan
would be more efheient and les ex
pensive than the present s stem.
Dr. C. A. Ellwood, professor of so
ciolog I am in favor of the commis
sion form of government, because I
think that it would prove superior to
the existing form, in that the efficiency
of the administration would be in
creased W. 11. Allen, music dealer I can see
no possible objection to the commis
sion form of government. Just as we
expect results from a business, where
there is a man on the job all the time,
so we could look to commission gov
ernment for just as definite and more
beneficial results in the field of titv
management.
The Iflev. ('. D. Edwards dean of the
Bible College I am heartily in favor
of the commission form of govern
ment. I believe in putting competent
men at the head and holding them re
sponsible. Chris 0. Ehinger, tailor On the
question of commission government,
I am neutral. It has its advantages,
but as for eliminating graft, it will
not succeed. In Des Moines. la , and
other towns where I have seen this
form of government at work, the peo
ple are well pleased with the change,
but the town itself has ever thing to
do with the success or failure of such
a change.
I. A. Ilarlli, of the Victor Barth
Clothing Company I believe that the
affairs of a city can he more efiicientl
managed than at present, by a board
of three men who are paid sufficient
salaries to enable them to devote all
their time to the business of manag
ing the city. The commission form of
government, with its concentration of
responsibility, insures a business ad
ministration which would probably
save money to the city.
The Her. F. J. Hate, rector of the
Calvary Episcopal Church I would
vote for the commission form of gov
ernment were the question to come
up. "Wherever it has been honestl
tried, it seems to have proved a suc
cess. In the commission form ward
politics and petty graft are eliminat
ed. Responsibility is centered and
cannot be dodged. A chance is given
to experts, and thoroughness and pro
ficiency result.
I)r. Walter Mc'al Miller, secretary
of the Missouri Association for the
Relief and Control of Tuberculosis
I am in favor of the commission form
of government. Under it I believe ev
eryone receives the same considera
tion regardless of politics. I have
nothing to say against our City Coun
cil, but I believe that the city would
be served better under the commis
sion form.
C. W. Martin, poultr dealer Under
the commission form of government
wo would have persons who would be
responsible for the cit's affairs and
the public would be more efficiently
served. If that form is to be adopt
ed, however, w should be sure to get
good, efficient men and to pay them
enough so that they could devote all
their time to the city's business Per
sons who have lived in cities where
they have that form of government
tell me it Is the best
Dr. IV. E. Belden, physician As far
as I am posted, I believe that commis
sion government would only mean an
unnecessary expenditure of money
from the city treasury. The salaries
of men under this form of government
would be greater than those now paid
tho mayor and the councilmen, and yet
the city would get no more in return
than under the present form of gov
ernment. L. IV. lterrj, grocer I am decidedly
in favor of changing the present form
of government. The commission form
is absolutely the only practical way
to run the business of tho city. At
present the mayor and the councilmen

GET PEACE YET,
SAYS LOZIER OF TRIP
"Hopeful, hut Doubtful" Is
Way M. U. Student Sums
Up Ford Expedition.
3 WEEKS IN EUROPE
Sentiment Is for Ending War,
He Says, but There's a
Question of Time.
"Hopeful, but doubtful."
That's the way Lue C. Lozier, the
University of Missouri student who
went on the Ford peace expedition, ex
presses his opinion as to whether the
expedition will hasten peace. He be
lieves the neutral nations want peace;
they think, however, that it is impos
sible at this time.
The Ford party was in Europe three
weeks, according to Mr. Lozier, and
visited the capitals of Sweden, Den
mark, Norway and Holland. The mem
bers were also in England and Ger
many, but they were not permitted to
go to London or Berlin. D. Ernest
Hudson, an alumnus of the Universit
of Missouri, representing Harvard
University, was the only member of
the party who went to Berlin.
Meetings were held in Copenhagen,
Christiana, Stockholm and the Hague.
The party was, entnusiastically re
ceived at Stockholm, according to Mr.
Ixizier, and was also courteously
treated b the Germans No public
meetings to discuss the war are per
mitted in any of the Scandinavian
countries, but the party was allowed
to hold banquets and have after-dinner
talks.
Saw Little Evidence of War.
The party saw little evidence of war
in German. A handful of wounded
German soldiers at one of the rail
road stations was the only sugges
tion of war on tho whole tup.
The members of the party were re
ceived officially only in Sweden. Peace
organizations in the other countries
welcomed them cordially and assisted
them in every way possible, but
seemed to have little faith in the suc
cess of the expedition.
Mr. Lozier was one of forty college
students who made the trip. Three
women's colleges Vassar, Wellesley
and Barnard were represented.
Student Delegates Merely Guests.
The students selected as delegates
were not bound by any definite re
quirements, Mr. Lozier sas. The
did not even have to express them
selves as believing in the success of
the expedition. The presidents of the
various universities were asked mere
ly to recommend a student to be the
guest of Mr. Ford at his expense. The
students were largely responsible for
the little favor which the party gained
at Christiana, according to Mr. Lozier.
They made many friends among the
students in the countries visited.
Mr. Lozier is convinced that the Ger
mans feel confident of ultimate suc
cess in the war. The British block
ade of Germany is ineffective, he
thinks, Germany is obtaining sup
plies from Holland and the Scandi
navian countries.
At Copenhagen Mr. Lozier made an
address before the Anti-Prejudice
Club, an organization of students.
The American students did not re
turn on the Rotterdam with the rest
of the party, but left The Hague on
the Noordam three days earlier. The
Noordam encountered a severe storm
at sea and had to put in at St. Johns
for coal before going on to New York.
ExiK-dltion Well Managed, He Sajs.
In contradiction to some of the
newspaper reports, Mr. Lozier sas
the expedition was well managed and
the party well organized soon after
the trip began. Mr. Ford and most of
the delegates were sincere and deeply
in earnest, he thinks.
"I do not believe Mr. Ford really ex
pected that the expedition could end;
tho war," sas Mr. Lozier. "The main
purpose of the party was to endeavor
to bring about an official conference
of the neutral nations of Europe, to
gether with the United States. It was
hoped that the expedition could so in
fluence public opinion in the various
neutral countries as to bring pressure
to bear on the governments. Mr. Ford
believed that an official neutral con
ference would hasten peace."
