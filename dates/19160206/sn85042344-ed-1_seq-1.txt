considered an entiorsemenl ol Theo

The convention's sentiment on
Roosevelt Is expressed in these words:
"We recognise In Col. Theodore
Roosevelt the greatest iiin Ameri
can and the one possessed in fullest
measure of those great Qualities of
hear! and mind which make him the
matchless leader oi patriotic Amer
ica." Consideration of Roosevelt's
name is r mmended to the national
convention In Chicago, The vote on
the Roosevelt resolution was SO to 00.
No roll call was bad on the Harris en
dorsement, many of the delegates not
otlng.
The Harrls-Disney-Roosevell com
bination worked successfully, and .al
though Harris got all thai was prom
ised him out ol the deal Disney was
forced to accept a "hall portion" as
the Roosevelt action was not exactly
an endorsement of Teddy but rather
a ' resolution of n raise."
