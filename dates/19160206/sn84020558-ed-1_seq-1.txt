OTTAWA, Feb. 5. A fire today in
the Jardine Munitions factory at Hes
pelcr, Waterlio county, Ontario, so
alarmed the ni iniigon'ei.t and village
n. horitios tha' Ihev appl.ed to U-.
vr to have o.-ierwl o it an overseas
regiment stationed in the neighbor
hood. The blaze, however, was got un
der control after it had destroyed the
shell manufacturing building and dam
aged several other structures.
Two Austrians and one German were
arrested on suspicion. Hut for a ipiick
response of the fire department the
authorities said tonight that the en
tire plant would probably have been
destroyed.
The fire, which broke out in the ma
chine shop, spread rapidly.
Company officials said there was no
doubt that it was of incendiary origin.
Authority was given by the militia
department to call out a militia guard
at llespeler to protect the Jardine
property.
llespeler is situated in a remote part
of Waterloo county and the mili'ia
department has been unable thus far
to obtain details regarding the reported
explosion. The town is 12 miles south
east of Merlin, which is 62 miles west
if Toronto. The population is about
5,090 and there are several factories
in the place.
A flash of flames from the ruins of
the parliament building and the alarm
of fire which quickly followed, caused
apprehension throughout the city to
night but the blaze was quickly ex
tinguished. Little additional da maje
wns caused.
The alarm was turned in from the
block in which are located the offices1
of Premier I'.orden, the state depart
ment, the Canadian secret box and the
vaults of the Dominion government.
It called out not only the firemen but
the overseas military forces and a great
rrowd of spectators. When the fire
was out the troops were returned to
their quarters but the strength of the
cordon of armed guards about the
buildings on parliament hill was dou
bled. Secret service men opened a trunk
today left in lieu of a board bill at a
hotel here just before the outbreak of
the war by a man who registered as
Curl Schybert. The hotel received a
remittance yesterday for the amount
of the lull with the request that the
trunk be forwarded to San Francisco.
.i the trunk were found carefully
drawn sketches of the chief Canadian
cities and of many portions of the
boundary line between the Dominion
and the I'nited States. There also
were maps with note books containing
descriptions written in German.
Colonel Sherwood, head of the se
cret service, was informed by telephone
tonight that three aeroplanes had been
seen on the Canadian side of the St.
Lawrence river, apparently following
the line of the Grand Trunk railwav
which connects Mossena Springs, N.

PROVIDENCE, R. 1. Feb. 5. Mrs.
Elizabeth F. Mohr was acquitted to
night bv a jury in the superior court
of a charge of having instigated the
raurd'T of hei husband. Dr. C. Frank
lin Mohr. C. Victor Brown and Henry
li. Spellman, negroes, who were ac
cused of the actual killing were found
guilty. The jury reported at 0:07
o'clock, alter having been out since
11-50 o'clock this morning.
Mrs. Mohr swooned while the fore
man was announcing the verdicts.
Her head drooped forward and sho
was slipping from her chair when her
attorney grasped and supported her.
"Is ther? ar.y other charges agains
these d-'fendants?'' inquired Justice
Steirns.
"There is, your honor." replied At
torney General Rice, "but Mrs. Mohr
is on hail on the other charges."
"The defendants Brown and Spell
man are committed without bail," said
the court, ajid Mrs. Mohr is dis
charged from custody on this com
pliant." The other charge against Mrs.
Mohr and the two negroes is that
they committed an assault on Miajs
Fmily Burger with intent to kill. Miss !
Burger was shot while riding with
Dr. Mehr on the night he was at- j
tucked. Brown and Spellman are ac- !
cused of actually firing the shots at j
Miss Burger, while Mrs. Mohr is j
charged with being an accessory be
fore the fact of the crime. j
The first word received from the j
.'ury after it took the case came at
5.25, when it was announced that
further instructions were desired. Half
an hour later the prisoners had been
brought to the courtroom, but a depu
ty shfiiff informed the judge that the
jury had decided that the instructions
asked for were not needed.
Less than ten minutes elapsed when
word came that the jury was ready
to report. The jurymen looked tired
and worn as tl?y passed into the
court room. After each had taken his
place in the jury box the clerk asked
the foreman: "Do you find the de
fendant Cecil Brown guilty or not
guilty?"
As the foreman replied "guilty"
Mrs. Mohr collapsed. While her coun
sel were assiting her the ' clerk con
tinued: "Do you find the defendant
Harry Spellman guilty or not
guiltvV"
"Guilty."
"Do you find the defendant Eliza
beth F. Mohr guilty or not guilt'?''
"Not guilty."
Mrs. Mohr apparently was in a
stupor when the foreman pronounced
the words "not guilty." She recov
ered quickly, however. Newspaper
men began to surround her but were
ti.ld by her counsel, John J. Fitzgerald
that she was not in any condition to
talk.
"The fight has only begun." was
the comment of William H. Lewis,
counsel for Brown. Mr. Lewis has
taken numtrous exceptions during the
trial and said that he might carry
the case to the supreme court.
Attorney General Rice refused to
ct mment on the verdict. He would
not say when the other charge against
Mrs. Mohr would be tried, if at all.
The trial began January 10 and the
jury had been kept together all that
time. They went to their respective
homes for the first time in four
weeks, after having been paid off to
night.
Dr. Mohr, a physician practicing in
is city and Newport, was shot fa
tally on the evening of August ?.l
1015, as he was sitting in his stalled'
automobile in a lonely spot in Bar-
ringtdn. '
George W. Ilealie, the negro chauf
feur, made a confessien, in which he

The police also claimed that the

which were subsequently repudiated.
