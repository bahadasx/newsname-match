TIE JANUARY POST OFFICE
RECEIPTS BROKE ALL RECORDS
OFFICE TOOK IN $2,699.80,
GAIN OF $519.21 OYER LAST
JANUARY.
That business conditions are im
proving in Columbus is evinced by
the fact that receipts during the
month of January were larger than
for any similar period during its his
tory, showing a gain of $519.21 over
January. 1915, and an advance of
$406.80 over the corresponding per
iod in 1914.
The Commercial is indebted to
Postmaster Sharp and Assistant Post
master J. B. Gardner for these fig
ures, and in making them public,
which was done at the request of this
paper, Capt. Sharp called attention
to the fact that postal receipts fur
nished a most reliable business bar
ometer, and are generally regarded
as reflecting most accurately general
commercial conditions. Bearing this
fact in mind, it is easy to see that
Columbus is growing, for while con
ditions were depressed a year ago
they were normal during the early
portion of 1914, and as the tabula
tion shows a healthy increase over
January of that year, the growth of
the city is clearly indicated.
Total receipts for January during
the past three years were as follows:
1916, $2699.80; 1915, $2180.59;
1914, 2293.00.

ED NEAR LIBRARY.
MINISTER MJKKEL
AND OTHERS HURT
Financial Lom hat Not Seen
Estimated, But Will Beach
Into Million.
Canada's palatial parliament build
ing at Ottawa was practically de
stroyed Friday morning by flame
wl ieh broke out near the' library,
am! which, resisting all effort to
subdue them, spread rapidly, finally
reducing the magnificent structure
to a mass of twisted steel, broken
biick and charred timber.
Several people are known to have
lost' their lives and it is thought
that nearly a score were injured,
many of them seriously. The bod'es
of two ladies, Mme. Bray, of Mon
treal and Mme. Mown, of Beauce,
have already been removed from the
ruins, and others are said to be mis
sing.
The financial loss resulting from
the fire, which is said to have been
started by the explosion of a bomb,
has not been estimated, but will
probably reach well into the million?.
Sir Robert Borden, the Canadian
premier, who was in the building, es
caped safely, but Martin Burrell,
minister of agriculture, was burned
severely about the head. Dr. Micheal
Clark, member of the Red Deer, v .s
burned about the hands. Many of the
legislators experienced great diffi
culty in groping their way throusrh
smoke filled corridors. Several f b i
through wii dows and down ladders
to the street.
The entire fire fighting equipment
of Ottawa 'kin unable to cope with
th flames a.id MayoV Martin; of
Montreal, a member of parliament,
finally ordered the ' Montreal ' fire
brigade to Ottawa. Half an hour af
ter the fire was discovered the glass
roof over the commons chuber fell
and it appeared that the handsome
gothic structure was doomed.
When Speak Sevigny too't the
chair and opened the session of the
House at 8 o'clock only about fifty
members were in their seats. A dis
cussion relating to fisheries was pro
ceeding when a messenger rushed in
the room shouting, "Fire, run for
your lives!"
The members were driven back
by smoke and flames when they
sought an exit through the two main
doors.
Minister of Agriculture Burrell
was overcome as he made his way
through the thickest of the smoke
and fell just in front of the post of
fice. He was picked up by Robert
Rogers, minister of public works; J.
O. Reid, minister of customs, and
Pierre Blondin, secretary of state. It
was found that while his injuries
were serious he will recover.
Dr. Clarke was burned while at
tempting to obtain his coat from
a locker in one of the corridors out
side of the chamber. These lockers
were hidden behind a current of
smoke.
One of the first men to make his
way out of the building was Col. Jno.
Currie, who commanded .the Four
teenth regiment of the Canadian
First Division through the battle of
St. Julien, where he was overcome
with asphyxiating gas. Col. Currie
at once organized into a fire brigade
members of the House, telegraph
operators and police attendants, who
hianned several lines of emergency
hose. They played streams on the
flames but soon were driven back
by the terrific heat.
Several police and firemen were
burried by falling walls.
Mr. S. Milton Rainey, Jr., was
called to Mayhew yesterday on ac
count of the illness of his father,
Dr. S. M. Rainey.
Mr. Carl Tesch will be in St. Louis
a few days, where he went to attend
the Merchant Tailors' Association
meeting of 1916.
Mr. Charley Sherrod, Jr., has re
turned from a business trip to
Natchez.
Mr. John Oliver, of the A. and M.
College, is .spending the week-end

eems apparent from the outcrop
ping following a pperial meeting of
ihiit bo.ly held today. While the
meeting was executive and behind
.loicd door, sufficient wa learned
after its close to know that "in a dip
lomatic kind of way," as expressed
by a member, the governor intimated
his desire that all of the present
members hand in their resignation.
It seems there ate no vacancies nf
present, the terms of the members
running from one to three years.
None of the members seemed ready
to resign, and it was so stated to
Gov. liilbo, and there is some cur
iosity to know what the aftermath
will be.
It is understood that George R.
Hightower, president of the Agricul
tural and Mechanical College, who
owes his election to the trustees, ia
persona non grata to the governor,
and therefore a vacancy would be
appreciated by the latter.
Aside from this little difference of
opinion everything went harmon
iously, and reglar routine business
was transacted. The following reso
lution, among other thhnga, was
adopted:
Resolved, That the board of trus
tees of the higher educational instil
tutions of Misaitisuppi desir to urge
upon the Legislature the wisdom of
providing for the issuance of bonds
to take care of the permanent im
provements which are imperative
needs at the institutions under the

.ation, a member ex-officio, were
present at the meeting.
Mr. Albeft J. Loeb, of the firm of
Simon Loeb & Brother, leaves today
for New York City, where he goes to
spend several weeks. Mr. Loeb is
going east for the purpose of pur
chasing a complete line of spring and
summer goods for his establishment.
MAY CALL IN
ON OEMONSTRATOR
MATTER CAN BE SETTLED
SYNCHRONOUSLY WITH
SURVEYOR CONTEST.
t their regular monthly meeting
wh'ch begins tomorrow the board of
supervisors will probably call a spe
cial election to name t successor io
Mr. Quincey Ayres, who was last
November elected county surveyor
:u'! who later resigned to accept an
important position with the federal
government, and it has been suggest
ed that the people be allowed to
vote at the same time on the ques
tion of employing a county demon
strator. By allowing the people to vote on
both matters synchronously the fi
nancial interests of the county
would be conserved, as the expense
of an additional election would be
entirely dispensed with.
Many people are anxious for a
county demonstrator, and the de
mand for an election to finally set
tle the matter is general.
Will Meet Here ia March.
The State Convention of the Moth
ers' Congress will be held in Colum
bus March 29-30, and many delegates
from over the state are expected to

Mothers' Cengress, will be on the
program. Although in existence for
many years, this is the first time
that the people of Columbus have
had the honor of entertaining the
state convention.
The Home Science Department
and the girls in the Mabel Ward
Practice Home will be at home on
Friday afternoon from 4 to 6 o'clock
to town friends and th faculty of
the college.
