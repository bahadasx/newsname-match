WITH
BERLIN'S OVER DISPUTE
LATEST REPLY,
OFFICIALS SAY
Developments of Last Twenty
Four Hours Considered Sig
nificant of Favorable Turn
in Controversy.
Impression Gains Ground That
Lansing Has Advised Presi-
, ! dent Acoept Proposals Made
by Germany;
' Strongest intimations came from
official quarters today that the
German reply to the Lnsltanin pro
posals is satisfactory to the Unit
ed States Government.
Developments of the last twenty-four
hours considered as signif
icant of a favorable turn in the
controversy were:
ADMITS OBLIGATION.
Announcement that the German
rply 'contains the admission that
1 Germany Is obligated to pay In
demntty for loss of American lives
On the Lusltanla a conoesslon
rrom the earlier offer to pay In
demnity without an admlslon of
liability to pay.
The admission by the German
jpovernmejjt In Us reply that sink
Insr of the Lusltanla as an net of
retaliation, was not Justified when-
It Jeopardized the lives of neu
trals. This. was Germany's reply
to thr demand for" an admission of
tW nieiraiity of kMUnrAmerlcansi
,n the-MAisltanla. , f x
, Secretary Lansing and Count
von BernatorfX met Informally at
the. Metropolitan Club "and dl
, cussedtheLUsttonlo.. negotiations.
Count von Bernstorff appeared to
bo unusually optimistic after the In
terview and last night sent a com
munication to his government over
State Department wires,
President Wilson has had the
German reply before him since Fri
day evening and has not communi
cated wjt,h. Secretary Lansing con
cerning it except by telephone.
Think Lansing Satisfied.
Out of this series of developments the
Impression has Rained ground rapidly
in Washington that Secretary Lansing
has reached the decision that the Ger
man proposals should bo accepted, and
has so advised President Wilson.
One report widely credited was that
the formal announcement of settlement
nf the controversy will be made after
the Cabinet meeting Tuesday, and that
the German ambassador already has
notified his government of the virtual
conclusion of the negotiations as a pre
liminary step to the simultaneous an
nouncement of a settlement In Wash
ington and Berlin.
Secretary of State Lansing has given
in official confirmation of theso report
that settlement Is near. The only for
mal admission he has made is that tho
I nlted Stales and Germany are not
deadlocked over the Lusltanla case, and
thst the Informal negotiations with
ount von Rernstorff arc still In prog
ress. All officials realize that the Lusltanla
case Is up to President Wilson, and that
he will have the deciding volco In the
matter. As yet he has given no sign
of the attitude he will take.
London Says Berlin's
Last Word to Lansing
May Depend on Drive
LONDON, Feb. . Germany's final
word In the Lusltanla controversy with
the United States may ha given only
when she has won or failed In the
great offensive on the western front
now rapidly developing.
Germany is aiming a great drive di
rected either at Calais or Paris, but
from the preparations that a"re being
made apparently a colossal offensive will
be inaugurated all along the. western
front
From many sources (here come re
ports, too, that tho great German fleet
111 come out Into tho North Sea led
u new types of fighting craft to do
battle with Admiral Jelllcoe's warships.
The land battle-is expected here to be
Rrniany's final attempt to break the1
Mies of the-allies In Franco, and until
Motory or defeat ends the attempt the
Imerican controversy must wait.

Some House Members Believe
Newlands Urgent Deficiency
Amendment Will Fail.
FITZGERALD TO LEAD FIGHT
He Has Little Sympathy With At
tempt to Halt a Contract Al
ready Let.
TV. vTr1aniis amendment to the
urgent deficiency bill, which provides
that the construction of the Govern
ment's central light, heat, and power
plant shall be hatted until the plana
are approved by the Fine Arts Com
mission and the President, is expected
to meet strong opposition from the
House conferees.
It Is understood that at least one of
tho House conferees on the bill. Chair
man Fitzgerald, of the Appropriations
Committee, Is unalterably opposed to
the provision, and If the Senate Insists
upon the amendment there Is likely to
be a long deadlock.
Want Work' to Proceed.
In this position It Is believed that Mr.
Fltrgerald will not only have tho sup
port of the othor two House conferees
Congressmen Eagan and Cannonbut
that the Appropriations Committee of
the lower body will not accept the Sen
ate amendment which would hold up the
construction of the central plant.
Tho original appropriation for the cen
tral plant was made throe years ago. It
Is contended by membors of the House
committee that tho contract for tho
building has been lot, the excavation
begun and the building Is practically un
der way. The recent agitation on the
part of architects and others to pre
vent tho construction of tho building
because it will "disfigure the Mall" is
rather belated, according to certain
of tho House committee members.
This belated agitation, it is pointed
dirB developed when the Treasury De
partment soiythUto Increase by o. rela
tively, small 'am6unt the" limit f cost of
the building in o'rdor that It might ftc
commodato new Government structures
not contemplated when tho original -appropriation
was made .
Likely to Be Rejected.
Congressman Fitzgerald. It Is under
stood, has tittle sympathy with the at
tempt now made to halt a contract al-,
ready let, although he appreciates tho
fact that the protests come from a num
ber of leading architects from various
sections of the country. Nevertheless,
he Is expected to argue before tho con
ference committee that the work has
been started and should be allowed to
proceed.
The Indications are that the Newlands
amendment will be rejected by the
House conferees. If tho Senate con
feree stand ttrm, the bill will event
ually go back to both houses, and the
confarees may be "Instructed" one way
or tho other. This, however, would not
come until the bill has been In confer
ence for a considerable length of time,
and It Is posslblo that after one or two
conferences the Senate oonferees, Sen
ators Martin, Bryan, and Smoot. may
yield.
The Newlands amendment reads:

Investigator Finds Cat Skins
From City Dump Made Into
Wearing Apparel.
NEW YOBK, Feb. 6. Furs made into
neckpieces nnd muffs from the skins of
cRts brought from Barron Island, tho
city's dumping ground, are helleved to
be the cause of many of the recent an
thrax cases, according to a statement
by Dr. C T. Graham-Rogers, of the de
partment of labor division of Industrial
hygiene.
As the result of a thorough Investiga
tion of tho fur shops of New York city
conducted by Dr. Graham-Rogers, he
has prepared a report to be submitted
to the Industrial commission advocating
tho enforced discontinuance by manu
facturers of the use of these skins for
human wear.
Dr. Graham-Rogers' investigation was
brought about by the death tour months
ago from anthrax of Wanda Belote, six
months old. of Brooklyn. Thero was no
direct cause of Infection traceable in
tne child's case except the possibility of
the disease having been transmitted
through a fur piece she wore around her
neck. This fur was traced directly to
a refining company which disposes of
the offal from Barren Island. It led to
the discovery that most of the cat skins
used by fur manufacturers tn this city
como from that source. Thousands of
theso cat skins were found being made
up Into children's fur sots to ne dis
posed of to dealers.
The process of sterilization employed
at Barren Island and that which Is gono
through by the dryers in thla city Is not
sufficient to destroy the anthrax spore
which might be present In the skins. It
is said. The cnt skins are sold by the
dyers to manufacturers, many of them
being made up In tenements before the
finished fur Is placed on the market.
Cat skins from Barron Island were
subjectod to caroful examination by Dr
Graham-Rogcra and were found to carry
spores closely resembling the anthrax
spore although It is scientifically im
possible absolutely to Identify them.
