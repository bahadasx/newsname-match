STATE BONDING BILL 1$
H. J. LIE WINS
LEGAL VICTORY
IN IS
Appeared in Defense of Act At­
tacked by State Bonding
Companies.
WISDOM OF LEGISLATION
NOT JUDICIAL MATTER
'Judge Christiansoa Writes Opin­
ion of Tribunal, Others
Concur.
After a prolonged fight, extending
through two sessions of the legisla­
ture and twice submitted to the con­
sideration of a court, the supreme
court yesterday held that the law
creating a state bonding fund is con­
stitutional.
The petition of K. V. Moore, repre­
sentative of a Fargo bonding com­
pany, for a writ to restrain W. €.
Taylor putting the law into effect is
denied.
This decision clears the way for
the creation of a state bonding de­
partment for the purpose of furnish­
ing bonds to county, city, town, vil­
lage, school and township officers.
The court holds directly that no
provision of the federal or state con­
stitution has been violated and that
the wisdom, necessity or expediency
of the legislation are matters for leg­
islative and not judicial considera
tion.
The Syllabus.

ner, Defifhd&mS .'
The Syllabns:
(1). The'prerogative jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court may be exercised
only in cases wherein the questions
involved are publici juris, and the
sovereignty of the state, or its fran­
chises or prerogatives, or the liber­
ties of its people are affected, and
this jurisdiction cannot be exercised
to vindicate or protect mere prifate
rights regardless of their importance.
(2). In an original proceeding in
the Supreme Court, the State is the
actual plaintiff, and the relator, a
mere incident.
Only Test.
(3). The only test of the validity
of an act regularly passed by a state
legislature is whether it violates any
of the express or implied restrictions
of the state or federal constitutions.
(4-10). The wisdom, necessity, or
expediency of legislation are matters
for legislative, and not judicial, con­
sideration.
(5). Chapter 62 of the laws of 1915,
establishing a State Bonding Fund
for the purpose of furnishing official
bonds for county, city, village, school
district and township officers is not
unconstitutional, as conferring judi­
cial powers on the iState Examiner
and Commissioner of Insurance.
(•6). Courts are not at liberty to de­
clare a law void as in violation of
public policy. Such policy is deter­
mined by the legislature, and the only
limits upon the legislative power in
such determination are those fixed
in the State and Federal constitu­
tions.
To Give Effect.'
(7). Chapter ©2, laws 1915, is not
invalid on account of delegating legis­
lative power to the Commissioner of
Insurance and State Auditing Board.
(8). The object of all statutory in­
terpretation and construction is to
ascertain and give effect to the in­
tention of the legislature.
(9). It is presumed that the legis­
lature intended to enact a valid law,
and, therefore, when a statute is sus­
ceptible, of two constructions* one of
which will render it valid and another
-which will render it unconstitutional
and void, the former construction will
be adopted.
(11). All constitutional inhibitions
against the taking of private proper­
ty without due processof law, and all
constitutional guarantees of equal
rights and privileges are for the ben­
efit of those persons only whose
rights are affected and cannot be tak­
en advantage of by any other per­
sons.
Original Proceeding.
(12). In an original proceeding in
the Supreme Court, wherein a law is
assailed as being unconstitutional,
the court will not anticipate condi­
tions. which may never arise, or de­
termine questions relating to the val­
idity of minor provisions which relate
to the validity of the whole act.

PARLIAMENT BUILDING
Ottawa, Ont., Feb. 5.—A lire' today
in the Jardine Munitions factbry at
Hespeler, Waterloo county, Ont., so
alarmetl the management arid the vil­
lage authorities that they applied to
Ottawa to have ordered out an Over­
seas regiment statibned in the neigh­
borhood.
The blaze, however, was got under
control, after it had destroyed the
shell manufacturing building and dam­
aged several other structures.
Arrest Suspects.
Two Austrians and one German
.were arrested on suspicion. But for a
quick response of the fire department,
the authorities said tonight, the entire
plant probably would have been de­
stroyed. The fire, which broke out in
the machine shop, spread rapidly to
the rest of the building. Company offi­
cials said there was no doubt that it
was of incendiary origin.
Soon after the fire at Hespeler, May­
or Edwards of Gait requested the mili­
tary divisional headquarters at Lon­
don to dispatch troops there to guard
the munitions plant.
Fire In Parliament Ruins.
A flash of flame from the ruins of
the central section of the parliament,
building, and the alarm 6f fire which
quickly followed, caused apprehension
through the city tonight, but the blaze
was quickly extinguished. Little ad­
ditional damage was caused.
The alarm was turned in from the
block in which are located the offices
.of Premier Borden, the state depart­
ment, the Canadian secret police and
the big vaults of the Dominion gov­
ernment. It called out not only the
firemen but" the Overseas military
were returned to their quarters, but
forces and a great crowd.
When the fire was out, the trooos
the strength of the cordon of troops
was doubled about the parliament
building.
DRAGGEDiUNDER SLED
AND BADLY INJURED
McClusky, N. D., Feb. 5—Bob Krieg,
who has been employed at the Steve
Arneson farm, north of this city,
during the past fall and winter, met
•with a bad accident on Tuesday. The
young man was hauling a sled load of
wheat to town and "was near the
Occident elevator when his team
started to run.
He was on the ground at that time,
and ran in front of the animals to
stop them. He lost his footing and
was drawn under the sled. The team
ran about 200 feet before they were
stopped, dragging young Kreig un­
der the sled. After being extricated
from his position, he was taken to
the McClusky- hospital, where Dr.
Brown dressed his wounds. His left
leg was broken in two places 'below
the knee, and his right ankle badly
sprained. At present he is reported
as rapidly recovering. His home is
in Wisconsin and he came to this
state last year to work through har-

Entire Counties Submerged by
Rapidly Rising Waters in
Arkansas.
ARKANSAS CITY IS
IN GRAVE DANGER
Relief Train Sent Out to Aid the
Sufferers Mississippi Reaches
Record Stage.
Little llock, Ark., Feb. 5.—Resi­
dents of the territory in the south­
eastern corner of Arkansas tonight
faced a perilous situation. Two-thirds
of Lincoln, Desha and Chicot coun­
ties are covered with water, which is
flowing southward through a half doz­
en breaks in Arkansas river levees.
Arkansas City, McGehee and Lake
Village and dozens of smaller towns
are flooded and the high stage of the
Mississippi river added a new danger.
At Arkansas City the level of the
Mississippi river is 15 feet above the
town.
'Levees Weakening.
So far all Mississippi levees are re­
ported holding, but the flood waters
inside the levees are certain to weak­
en the mud. At Arkansas City the
stage of the Mississippi river today
was 5 1-2 feet, the highest ever
known. Water from the Arkansas
river flood is six to eight feet deep
in the main streets of the town and
expected to go four feet higher. About
1,000 residents have left the city,
which now is cut off from communi­
cation with the outside world, except
by boat. There are 500 homeless and
hungry persons in the town.
A dispatch early tonight said that
the Chicot levee is in a precarious
condition, and that if it should, break
Arkansas City would be wiped off the
map. A message received from
there tonight said that immediate aid
^-lteededf
A serious condition also exists at
Clarendon, where the White river
rose four feet today.
All Men Working.
Sheriff Frank Milwell tonight tele
phoned from Clarendon that water is
but a few inches from the top of the
levee, but he said every man in the
town was at work in the levee, and
he was confident of winning the fight.
Five hundred people left the town
tonight.
A relief train in charge of the St.
Louis ilron Mountain & Southern rail­
road officials left late today for the
flooded districts along the lower
course of the Arkansas.
Send Out Relief.
A great supply of food and provi­
sions were carried and a large motor
launch with which to distribute the
food. It was planned to run the
train as far below Pine Bluff as the
conditions permit and then continue
in the launch. It is reported that
many persons, especially negroes, liv­
ing in the district, neglected to heed
the warning to leave their homes,
and it is believed that the lowering
water will reveal deaths have result­
ed.
One Town Inundated.
Clarendon, Ark., F'eb. 5.—The White
river levee broke here tonight, flood­
ing this town, of 5,000 inhabitants. Be­
cause the break occurred near the city
limit,'the water was several hours
reaching the residence sections and
ample warning had enabled all women
and children to be moved fr* safe
places in the city. No loss of iife has
been reported.

Extra Police
In New York
New York, Feb. 5.—Police have
been assigned to protect thl subway
system from the Brooklyn terminal to
the Bronx terminal on the strength of
a report that a threat has been made
to dynamite the underground road.
The Interborough Rapids Transit Co.
has admitted that' police help has been
asked.
A dozen uniformed policemen are
guarding the Hudson Terminal build­
ing.
Patrolmen from various stations in
Manhattan were assigned at 11 o'clock
tonight to stand watch at the uptown
and downtown entrances to all sta­
tions of the subway -system others
were detailed to the.entrances to what
is known as the iFourjth avenue line

German Diplomats Find Substi­
tute for ObjectPal Word
"Illegal."
NO REPRISALS AGAINST
NEUTRALS IN FUTURE
Washington. Feb. u.For the word,
"illegal," which 'Germany was unwill­
ing to incorporate in the tentative
draft of the Lusitania agreement, the
.Berlin foreign office has substituted
a phrase which certain high author­
ities in a position to lit- familiar with
the status of the negotiations consid­
er covers all the principles involved
in the question of submarine war­
fare.
The language substitoted fqr, the
objectiontble word, nlegal, in a
tentative communication now heing
considered by President Wilson avers
that the killing of Americans in the
Lusitania disaster was without in
tent, because the destruction of the
Cunard liner was ail act of reprisal,
and the German government agrees
that reprisals should not be applied
to neutrals.
Outlook Promising.
From various diplomatic and offi­
cial quarters tonight comes the infor­
mation that the outlook is promising
for an early settlement. It was indi­
cated that the tentative form of set­
tlement which, should it prove accept
able to the United States, will be em­
bodied in a formal communication
from Germany, approaches nearer the
desires of the United States than any
yet submitted with the authority of
Berlin officials.
Secretary Lansing and Count von
Bernstorff, the (Ionium ambassador,
met quite informally in the Metropol­
itan club here today. The ambassa­
dor seemed extraordinarily optimistic
at the conclusion of the talk.

St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 5.—Police re­
serves were called out twice tonight
to quell disturbances that broke out
when crowds stormed the auditorium
in an effort to gain admittance to the
municipal costume ball, the conclud­
ing feature of St. Paul outdoor sport
carnival.
Soon after the doors Were opened,
the big building was packed to over­
flowing. Attendants later sucteeded
in locking the doors, but the thous­
ands without fought for admittance,
picking the locks and forcing the
doors. Squads of police who respond­
ed to the riot calls soon restored or­
der and no arrests were made.
One woman fainted and had to be
carried to an ambulance.
Louis W. Hill, president of the
Great Northern railroad, together with
his several score personal aides and
directors of the carnival association,
tonight was given a tumultuous ova­
tion at the municipal costume ball,
with the attendant selection of the
queen of the carnival.
Reviving and elaborating a celebra­
tion originated in St. Paul more than

Evidence.
Providence, R. I., Feb. 5.—Mrs. Eliz­
abeth P. Mohr was acquitted tonight
by a jury in the superior court of a
charge of having instigated the mur­
der of her husband, Dr. C. Franklin
Mohr. C. Victor Brown and Henry H.
Spellnian, negroes, who were accused
of the actual killing, were found guil­
ty. The jury reported at 6:07 o'clock,
after having been out since 10:50
o'clock this morning.
Mrs. Mohr Faints.
Mrs. Mohr swooned while the fore­
man was announcing the verdict. Her
head dropped forward and she was
slipping from her chair, when her at­
torneys grasped and supported her
while a court officer rushed for a glass
of water.
"Is there any other charge against
these defendants?" inquired Justice
Stearns.
"There is, your honor," replied At­
torney General Rice, "but Mrs. Mohr
is on bail on the other charge."
"The defendants, Brown and Spell
man, are committed without bail,"
said the court, "and Mrs. Mohr is dis­
charged from custody on this com­
plaint."
Another Charge Pending.
The other charge against Mrs.
Mohr and the two negroes is that they
committed an assault on Miss Emily
Burger, with intent to kill. Miss Bur­
ger was shot while riding with Dr
'Mohr on teli nigtit" 'he was attacked.
Brown and Spellnian are accused of
actually firing the shot at Miss Bur­
ger, while Mrs. Mohr is charged with
being an accessory before the fact of
the crime.
Mrs. Mohr apparently was in a
stupor when the foreman pronounced
the words "not guilty." She recover­
ed quickly, however.
"The fight has only begun," was file
comment of William H. Lewis, coun­
sel for Brown, who said he might
carry the case to the supreme court.
The trial began January 10.
Shot On Auto Ride.
Dr. Mohr, a physician practicing in
this city and Newport, was shot fatal­
ly on the evening of August 31, 1915,
as he was sitting in his stalled auto­
mobile in a lonely spot in Barrington.
George W. Hillis, the negroe chauf­
feur, made a confession in which he
alleged Mrs. Mohr had agreed to pay
him, Brown and Spellnian $5,000, of
they would murder her husband. Hil­
lis pleaded guilty to manslaughter
and became a witness for the state,
Dr. and Mrs. Mohr had been living
apart for two years because of quar­
rels as a result of his alleged atten­
tions to Miss Burger and other wo­
men. The defense claimed that Mrs.
Mohr loved her husband and had been
involved in the case by the actual
murderer.
Mrs. Mohr made a brief statement
after returning to her home tonight.
"I am home again," shfe said, "with
my children, and I hope to be allowed
peace to devote the rest of my life
to their welfare."
BLINDPI6GER SIGNS
PLEDGE AND IS SENT
E TO HIS FAMILY
(FROM COURIER NEWS)
Fargo, Feb. 5.—Because there was
a wife and five children dependent
upon him for support and of the fact
that he signed a pledge "to forever
abstain from the use of all intoxicat­
ing liquors as a beverage," Arthur L.
Stevens, one of the 12 violators of
state prohibition laws, arrested by
Sheriff J. C. Ross, had sentence sus­
pended by the court yesterday morn­
ing.
A "Dead-Open" Case on Stevens.
Officials of the sheriff department
had a "dead-open" case on Stevens,
who early in the week pleaded guilty
to the charge preferred against' him,
yesterday morning. Stevens was
among the six to face the court for
sentence. After Judge Pollock had
sentenced Stevens to a year in the
county jail and a fine of $300 with an
additional 90 days in default of the
$300, the court ordered that sentence
be suspended during good behavior,
asserting that greater good could be
accomplished if Stevens would stop
drinking and become a good citizen
than if he was made to serve and the
wife and the children suffer as a con­
sequence.

LONG WED FOR TEUTONIC
SAYS U.S. NAVY CAN 8E
GREATEST IN THE WORLD
New York, Feb. 5.—The United
States has in its navy the nucleus of
the greatest fighting machine in the
world, according to Frank J. Sprague,
chairman of the committees on elec­
tricity and shipbuilding of the naval
consulting board, who returned here
today, after spending a month aboard
the battleship, New York and witness­
ing the maneuvers of the Atlantic
fleet in southern wateers.
Mr. 'Sprague declared the two vital
requirements of the navy at present
are more officers and men and great­
er efficiency in target practice. He
said the government could not spend
too much money in this regard.
Mr. Sprague is preparing a detailed
report of his trip, which he will for­
ward to Secretary Daniels at Wash­
ington.
Says German Raider Was One
Which Performed Wonder­
ful Feat,
NOTHING BUT $180,000
IN GOLD BARS TAKEN
*~'-Cvok
Yoi,. Feb.- 5.^ffcij~6«nnatr
raider ttfat captured the British steam­
ship Appam was the Ponga, according
to Captain H. G. Harrison, former
master of the Appam, who reached
here today from NorfolJc on the steam­
ship Hamilton. With Captain narri
son were his officers and crew, num­
bering 150, who probably will be sent
to England on the White Star liner
Baltic.
Captain Harrison said he had no
other recourse than to surrender when
he discovered the warlike character
of the ship that stopped him.
When the cruiser was less than two
ship-lengths away, he was ordered to
hoard her with his deck officers and
a number of his men.
The name of the raider, he declared,
appeared in English on the naviga­
tion charts hanging in the vessel's
pilot house and chart room, where He
was summoned by the commander.
"Nothing was taken from the Ap­
pam, except a shipment of gold bars
from South Africa valued at about
$180,000," lie said. "The Germans evi­
dently fcnew we had this gold, for I
was asked about it the first thing
when 1 stepped onto the deck of the
raider.
"I have no complaint to make of the
way we were treated by the Germans.
1 was invited by Lieutenant Berge
each evening at six o'clock to have a
West African cocktail with him."
Won't Decide Ownership.
The question of ownership of the
British steamship Appam, brought in­
to Hampton Roads by a German prize
crew, may remain an open issue until
the end of the war with the ship
meantime held in the custody of
American officials at Newport News.
Conflicting claims on behalf of Ger­
many and England are being consid­
ered by the state department and neu­
trality board, but there has been no
indication of a decision.
Officials generally are inclined to
the view, however, that the case must
be governed by the Prussian treaty
of 1828, which grants Prussian prizes
free entry to American ports and de­
clares that "they may freely be car­
ried out again at any time by their
captors to the places expressed in
their commission." A literal construc­
tion of that provision, which some offi­
cials favor, would permit the Appam
to remain indefinitely at Newport
News.
One hundred and fifty-three bags of
first-class mail from the British
steamship, Appam, brought here by
a German prize crew, were forwarded
for shipment from New York to Eng­
land and 'France. Wlhat disposition
will be made of the parcel post on
the Appam still is undetermined.
Several mild cases of malaria have
developed among the Germans on the
Appam and the commander was giv­
en permission today to come ashore
for medicine and other necessities.

LITTLE CHANGE ON
OTHER WAR FRONTS
Austrian-Italian Deadlock Show*
No Signs of Being
Broken.
London, Feb. 5.—The long loolced
for offensive of the Teutonic allies
against Saloniki may be on now or
near at hand.
An agency dispatch from Saloniki
reports that an artillery duel has been
in progress for two days near Doiran,
where strong forces of the Central
powers for some time have been fac­
ing position of the Entente allies.
Such a bombardment might well bo
the prelude to an advancing move­
ment by the Teutons and their allies
which, according to recent report's
from the Balkans, was set for about
the middle of the present month,' but
which may even now be in progress.1
According to the message through
Entente sources, reporting the open
ing of the bombardment the British
heavy guns were dominating those ol
rtlui fisrmanfi.. and.. Bulgaiftiig oppe&sd
to them.
Little Change..
Elsewhere along the main fighting
line of the widespread war Held, fey
operations of importance have been
recorded.
On the Franco-Belgium front the
French artillery continues its activity,
the bombarding being intense in the
Champagne and Argonne. Berlin re­
ports cases of sporadic activity by in­
fantry, one instance being south of
Labassee canal, where the British flfo
declared to have been repulsed when
one of their detachments attempted
an advance, while south of the Som
me, where the Germans made gains
only recently, the French were beaten
off in a hand grenade attack. In the
Vosges thfe German guns have been
bombarding French positions.
'Deadlock Unbroken.
Along the lines where the Austrians
and Italians are engaged, the dead­
lock shows no signs of being broken.
German reports declare the Italians
are worn out and discouraged by their
failure to advance and have recogniz­
ed the impossibility of breaking the
Austrian lines.
It is announced in Vienna that
peace negotiations with the Montene­
grin cabinet' ministers remaining in
their country have not been begun by
the Austrians, and will not be started
until the ministers are furnished with
unimpeachable credentials empower­
ing them to conclude a peace that
shall be binding.
The inauguration of an offensive
movement by the German and Bulgar­
ian forces which have been stationed
along the Greek frontier is reported
in a Saloniki dispatch. It is said that
an artillery duel has been in progress
for two days in the neighborhood of
Doiran and that the British heavy
guns are dominating those of their
adversaries.
An official Bulgarian report, as for­
warded from Athens to the Temps,
says that 470 men were killed, and
more than 500 wounded, during the re­
cent attacks by French aeroplanes on
Bulgarian camps.
The attack is said to have been
made by 17 aeroplanes. More than
200 bombs were dropped on the Bul­
garian camp at Peprich, in the Stru
mitsa valley. The bombardment was
over in 20 minutes.
