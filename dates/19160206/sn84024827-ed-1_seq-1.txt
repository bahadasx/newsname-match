LONDON, Feb. 5. The long expect
ed offensive of the Teutons against
Saloniki may be near. A dispatch from
Saloniki reports artillery duels have
been in progress for two days near the
Doran. where strong forces of the Cen
tral Powers for some time have been
facing the positions of the Allies. Such
a bombardment might be the prelude
of a Teuton advance, which, according
10 recent reports from the Balkans,
was set for the middle of the present
tronth and which may even now be in
progress. Elsewhere along the many j
fighting lines few operations of any
importance have been recorded.
According tn a message through al
lied sources from the Balkans, in re
porting the opening of the bombard
ment, the British heavy guns were!

la Basse canpl where the British are
declared to have been repulsed when
one of their detachments attempted
an advance. South of Somme, where
the Germans made gains recently, the
French were beaten off in hand gren
ade attorks. Few renor's of pronounc
ed activity come from Russia or Gali
c'a. The German airships in the
Tvinsk recion was the only incident
in this theatre mentioned in the Ger
man communication.
Along the Anstro-Italian line the
deadlock shows no signs of being brok
en. 'German reports declare the Ital
ians are worn out and discouraged by
their failure ip advance and have rec
onizpd the impossibility of breaking
the Austrian lines. No indications of
laseirc Italian activity, however, are
reflected in official reports.
From Mescpotamia the Turks are re
rorted driving back the British to their
former positions. Vienna announces

Austria and will not be started until

8. P. SHIP HEARING. "
NEW YORK. Feb. 6. Southern Pa
cific so dominated steamship traffic in
1909 that the Philadelphia and Gulf
line organized to handle freight be
tween Gulf ports and the Atlantic sea
board was unable to purchase or char
ter vessels and subsequently went Into
the hands of a receiver, according to
testimony offered before Interstate
Commerce Commissioner Mayer at a
hearing on the application of the Sou
thern Pacific to continue control of the I
Morgan line steamships under the !
Panama Canal act.
Frederick Groves who promoted the
Philadelphia & Gulf Line, testified the,
company had rates with railroads and i
was offered much freight, but the op
position of the Southern Pacific made '
it impossible to obtain ships. "Thel
Southern Pacific crippled us in every'
way," he testified.

The name of Calles has hitherto been

He also sent commands of soldiers out
into the country districts to destroy
the vinaterias where mescal was made:
On capturing Naco, Sonora, last sum

There will be no exclusive concess-

BERLIN. Feb. 5. In a leader head
ed "American Crisis." the Tajiliche

ous view of the situation existing be
tween Germany and the United
States, as result of the Lusitania
negotiations. It begins Dy declaring:
"Let nobody deceive himself about

and U4 rest on a knife's edge and can
not remain thus long. There must
quickly be either a lessening of the
tension in a friendly direction or a
catastrophral decision.
Continuing the Rundschau says:
"The present condition appears un

so can be read in the latest semi-cf-
1 ficial German communication con
cerning the existing relations between
Berlin and Washington. Wllhalm
