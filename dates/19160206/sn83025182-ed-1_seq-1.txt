According to these men. President
Wilson had made up his mind that in

dttJon of the country, the railroads
r'should
have more money so that an
sdded credit might be obtained for ex
tension work.
The hearing, however, Thome's

despite this apparent showing and de

Senators from the middle west,
Brandeis' oponents said today, have
been hearing voluminously from farm
ers and shippers in their states, all
strenuously opposed to Brandeis.
Organized labor however, generally
has taken a stand favorable to him.
Thorne will not be allowed to make
"his fight without facing opposition to
himself. Joseph N. Teal, a les^lng at
torney of Portland, Oregon, who also
appeared in the rate cases as an «Sr
sociate of Thorne, will appear In de
fense of Brandela. Lieutenant Gov
ernor Dshelman of California, former
head of the state railway commission,
of that state, and its representative
at the rate bearing, will appear also.
Another otarge against Brandeis Is
that, he appeared attorney on. bottt

L,ynn,--iKase., in

retained Brandeis to protect his in

averred that Brandeis also had been
retained by the creditors. On this
charge, Dr. P. J. Lennox, of this city,
has been summoned.
James F. Stanrow and fl. W. Wine
low, of the United Shoe Machinery
company, and connected with the Hlg
glnson financial Interests of Boston,
will appear to testify that Brandeis
drew the leasing clause for the com
pany, "the trust," and later attacked
these clauses as illegal after having
been retained by St. Louis, Mo., shoe
madufacturers. It was said about the
capltol today that these Interests to
gether with the New Haven, would en
deavor also' to have Richard Olney,
former attorney general, to appear In
confirmation. T. H. Spelling, of New
York city attorney who had been
connected with shoe machinery pat
ents, and C. W. Baron, financial writ
er of New York and Boston, also have
been summoned.
While the bitterness of the "early
antagonism to the appointment has
abated, the effect of the Thorne
charges which have been mailed to all
senators, have been that- the progres
sive republican group generally has
adopted an attitude that it "must be
shown" in regard to the rate cases.
This group quite approves of other
phases of Brandeis' activities and
opinions.
It Is considered a certainty Brandeis
himself will appear before the com
mittee, since he is the only person
who can answer several of the charges
against him.

As to how much longer the United
States will be willing to continue in

today said he could not state. That
point, he said, has not yet "entered
his thoughts."
At Monday's conferences the presi
dent and Secretary Lansing will con

Whatever the outcome of this con

PROVIDENCE, R. I., Feb. 6.—Mrs.
Elizabeth F. Mohr is free.
Found not guilty late today on the
charge of having hired three negroes
to waylay and kill her husband. Dr.
Charles F. Mohr, wealthy Newport
physician', while in an automobile
with his office assistant, Emily Bur
ger, Mrs. Mohr collapsed, sobbing in
court when the rerdlct was an
nounced.
For the two negroes, who were
charged directly witn the murder of
Dr. Mohr, the doors of the state's
prison yawn tonight. They were
found guilty of having killed the doc
I tor and seriously wounding the "other
woman" in the case which has stirred
Rhode Island for months.
Both Henry Spellman and Cecil
Victor Brown were pronounced guilty
on the murder charge. It was 6:05
ing for twalF%6urs and cairty-nve
inmutes, hinag retired At 10:30 this
morning.
Having three different verdicts to
announce, the strain following the an
nouncement of the clerk that a de
cision had been reached, was terrific.
The verdicts in the case of the ne
groes came first.
Mrs. Mohr leaned across the coun
sel table. Her hands were clinched.
Her face was deeply lined, her eyes
puffed and red.
Not a sound could be heard in the
court room, except the steady dron
ing of the clerk's voice and the an
swers of the foreman. With the ver
dict of guilty pronounced against the
negroes, the clerk asked:
"Mrs. Elizabeth Mohr not guilty? Is
that your verdict?"
Foreman Clark's answer, "It
is. v. us drowned by a sob from
the black garbed widow whose whole
lite depended upon the words that
the juror confirmed.
Attorney John J. Fitzgerald and
William F. Carroll, seated beside Mrs.
Mohr, reached over and lifted her to
a sitting position. Tears streamed
down Fitzgerald's face as he tried to
quiet her. But the freed woman sank
forward again, and for ten minutes
so remained, her head buried in her
hands, her body shaken with sobs.
Mrs. Mohr did not even raise her
head when Judge Stearns announced:
"Elizabeth F. Mohr hereby is dis
charged from this indictment."
Her attorneys then renewed their
efforts to quiet her.
On College Hill near the old court
house, hundreds of persons were wait
ing in a snow storm to hear the ver
dict. Mose of them had been there
since morning.

That is all 1 can say."
Later Mrs. Mohr went to her home
where she sat down to dinner with
her children without the shadow of
imprisonment hanging over her, for
the first time since last September.
Strangely enough the prison van
which carried the negroes from the
court house to their oell, passed the
Mohr residence on Elmwood avenue.
Bright lights shone from the house.
There was a ring of children's laugh
ter. Outside, through tne snow
storm, passed the van, the negroes
shackled to their keepers.
The van had difficulty making Its
way to the court house gate to take
the prisoners away. As they emerged
from the court house door, under cus
tody of five deputy sheriffs, jthe crowd
booted.
"Life for you: hang them," were
tlif s!iouts from the throng.
Neither Brown nor Spellman show
ed r.r .• 'notion when the verdict was
announced. Spellman blinked his eyes
-siii* tu iii'd f.o speak to Brown,
but the sobbing of Mrs. Mohr evident
ly caused him to change his mind and
he turned away.
Attorney Lewis made the custom
ary motions for a new trial, for
Brown and Spellman.
Attorney General Rice had nothing
to sav, following the return of the
verdict. He was obviously surprised.
Now that she is free, Mrs. Mohr
will receive one-tliird of the estate of
her dead husband, estimated to be
worth about $90,000.
