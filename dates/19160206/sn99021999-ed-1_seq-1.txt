National Committeeman Becomes
Anxious Lest Preferred Candi-
dates for Convention Dele
gates Lose Out.
HIS SLATE IDEA ONCE REJECTED
Another candidate for president
Is to enter the Nebraska field at
leaBt that Is the present expectation
'seeking the republican endorse
ment at the primaries.
"Who is he?" shouts the chorus.
His name Is Webster!
No, you have guessed wrong. He
is not our own John Lee Webster, of
beaming countenance and effulgent
garb, but he is William Grant Web
ster, a Chicago lawyer, who is throw
ing bis hat into the ring without
waiting- for any spontaneous popu
lar uproarlng.
For' further information let it be
known that WTilliara Grant Webster
has already had his name filed on
the official ballot as a republican
candidate for president in the state
of Minnesota, where the conditions
for entry are harder than It is In Ne
braska, requiring 500 signatures to
his petition, Instead of a paltry twenty-fire
called for by our law.
Having gotten into the (tame in Minne-
ta, William Grant Webster has come
to Nebraska, and, going on the theoiy
that nothing ran be so well done as when
done by oneself, has been posting him
self on the form of the filing petition and
the number of autographs that must
adorn it He called at the office of Elec
tion Commissioner Moorhead and was re
ferred to County Clerk Dewej', and la
the county clerk's office was made wise
to the fact that presidentlt' primary pe
titions go to the secretary of state at
Uncoln. 1
To those .with whom he talked Mr
Webster gave the appearance of a man
who was thoroughly In earnest about lf.a
candidacy. It is said that he once tried
to nominate' himself for United States
senator in Illinois, and that he studied
law In his youth In the office of Hobert
T. Lincoln. ' '''.' -

yesterday ...e says'
"While I have not determined what

A member of the Hall committee com

cleverly conc&Itd to. force a factional
fight, which ought, to be avoided, but
which Howell seems bound to promote.
What he wants is to fix up a delegate
slate of his own crowd to carry himself
along, regardless of the disturbing ef
fect on the party. Na republican of
aufficient caliber . and good standing to
be a delegate will have any trouble get

UNJUSTIFIABLE ACT OF WAR
THE HAGUE, Feb. 5. (Va Lon
don.) Dutch newspapers, both pro
German and anti-German, are unani
mous in demanding' from Germany
prompt explanation of and reparation
for the torpedoing of the Dutch tank
steamer Artemis by a German tor
pedo boat in the North -Sea. The

The Vadcrland recalls previous German
"errors' and dwells on the - danger of
further incidents of this nature. Inci

was doing while a conspicuously colored
perm a tqrpf dp fjotllla was calmly cruis
ing the busiest steamer track between
the Hook of Holland and the Noord

The Nleuwe Courant treats the case at
a breakdown of the "vaunted German
organization and discipline," which. It
says, seems urgently to need Improve
ment, especially from the viewpoint of
the safety of lives - and property of
neutrals. It demands complete pecuniary
and political satisfaction from Germany,'
and asks:
"Did the German flotilla attempt, per
haps, to remove all ships from the neigh
borhood fcf a sinking Zeppelin and fire
wildly and blindly when Its plan did not
seem to succeed?" This. It says, might
explain the act, though in no wise ex

tFrom a Staff Correspondent.)
LINCOLN, Feb. 5. (Speelal.)-Seed corn
should command more attention In 1SK
than ever before .owing to the lateness
of the season, according to Governor
Morehead in a proclamation Issued tody.
Here is what the governor has to say
about care to be exercised In the selec
tion of seed corn:
"To the Farmers of Nebrsska: It may
seem uncalled for me to warn you of the
seed corn condition for 1916. A warning
of this kind la sent out every year, but
from reports I am getting from different
sections of the country it appeals to me
of more importance In 1916 than ever lie
fore. '
"The lateness of the corn In 1915, and
the severe weather hsve lowered, and in
many instances, entirely destroyed the
germination of a great deal of our corn.

Sheep and Cattle
Growers Opposed to
The Homestead Bill
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.-Sheep and cat
tle men from the western state today
urged the senate lands committee to de
feat or at least radically modify the M0
acre graslng homestead bill, which has
psssed the house and is now pending In
the senate.
Dr. S. W. McClure, secretary of the Na
tional Wool Growers' association, of Halt
Lake City, ssld It would be Impracticable
for a, man on 640 acres to raise a single
sheep, because the tract was so small he
could not employ a herder and too large
to enclose with wire netting to keep out
the coyotes. Cattlemen, bo ssld, would
suffer more froni Isolated 640-acre home
steads than sheep men.
E. H. Crabb of Flagstaff, Arls., repre
senting the Arlxona Cattle Growers' as
sociation, urged that If the bill be passed
tt be amended so as to 'provide enough
dry crop cultivation to carry the animals
graed during the summer through the
winter. He argued that the bill would
entice mechanics and foreigners to the
landa when they did tiot have a chance
to make a living, because of their igno
re noa of graslng problems. .

It was said that the president al
ready has the proposal from Berlin
before him and wants to go over it
carefully before he begins confer

There was an undertone of eipec
tatlons that the tw-o governments
would be able to find common
ground for agreement in official
declarations that Berlin's reply hatf
not made the situation any more
serious.
The State department does not
consider that the general situation
surrounding the negotiations is any
more grave than it has been. It was
said In high official quarters tha

proposes a flat admission of Illegality
of the method of submarine warfare in
