A BUSINESS MEN'S POINDEXTER MEETING; WHY NOT?
BY THE EDITOR
I want to propose that the business men of
Tacoma invite Senator Poindexter to come here
and address them.
That would be the wisest, fairest and most all
around satisfactory development the campaign
could take between this time and the primary.
The truth is that the business men as a class
have been the ones who have opposed Poindex

Its home port Is Liverpool. Til
bury is on the left bank of the
Thames, a few miles east of Lon

opi-n Meeting Wednesday.
Wednesday evening at 8 o'clock
an informal meeting will be held
at the Commercial club, open to
the public, at which farmers, or
anyone else interested, may meet
the board and ask questions.
"The testimony at the Spokane
hearing yesterday," said Mr. Nor
ris this morning, "seemed to me
to indicate that Spokane was fa- i
vored by many parts of the North-1
west, as the most central location '<
for a federal land bank, but no
decision was reached, and none
will be until after we have been .
all over the United States. We j
shall finish our southern trip in
November, and might be able to
reach a decision early in Decem
ber. We were asked to include j
Washington, Orgon, Idaho, Mon
tana and Wyoming in the North
west district.
"The hearings have been at
tended by individual farmers,
masters of granges, and in fact,
all classes of people.
"The plan seems to be meeting
with enthusiastic approval, so far
as we can judge. The board al
ready has a stack of applications
so high"—he measured a distance
of about a foot —"from farmers
who areorganizing farm loan as
sociations. They cannot receive
charters nor borrow money until
the land-banks have been located
and organized; but they can take
the preliminary steps, and they
are doing it."
No plainer or more democratic
looking group of men arrived on
the train this morning than the
.federal farm-loan board.
Mr. Norris is small and wiry;
Herbert Quick Is over six feet tall,
and looks like a farmer; Mr.
Smith looks like any other unos
tentatious business man, and
Judge Lobdell like a very happy
father this morning, as he greet
ed his daughter, Miss Avis Lolh
dell, who had come from Portland
to meet him.
Miss Lobdell is somebody in her
own right, too, being no less a
person than the Portland passen
ger agent of the 0.-W. R. N. Co.

The militiamen are bronzed and
hard as veterans. The reported
enthusiastic receptions along tha

ter and still are about the only ones who do.
1 feel that a large measure of their distrust is
due to a misunderstanding of his attitude and
purposes.
They have been deceived by the reactionary
press and misled by narrow-minded politicians.
If they will meet Senator Poindexter and
listen to his own statement, much of their oppo
sition will vanish; of that I am certain.

WATCH YOUR STEP!
JOHN D. SAT HERE WHOLE
DAY, SIZING TACOMA UP
(Editor's Note: Following is
the second article by Mabel Ab
bott on interesting early day
events in Tacoma. The next will
deal witli Tncoma booms.)
By Mabel Abbott
"Yea, most all the big railroad
men came to Tacoma even in the
early days," explained Frank C.
Ross, Tacoma old-timer and mem
ber of the tideflat syndicate.
The name of John D. Rockefel
ler had come casually into the
story he was telling me, and I
had asked a question.
"If you wanted to see 'em, all
you had to do was to stay in Ta
come and they'd come along,
sooner or later.
John l>. Here City.
"I saw John D. Rockefeller
here about 1887 —I think it was.
He was at the Tacoma hotel, and
1 spent a good deal of time watch
ing him, trying to fathom out
what he was thinking.
"He'd sit on the veranda and
look out at the flats and the wa
ter, and across at the bluff, and
at the valley and up at the moun
tain. Then he'd go back and be
gin all over again. All day long
he'd sit there, just sizing the
thing up. It wasn't a bit of use
to try to guess by looking at him,
what he was deciding to do.
Ban<)iietM Adam*.
Then Charles Francis Adams,
president of the Union Pacific,
was out in 1889, not long before
I sold the American lake line to
his company. He stayed at the
Tacoma hotel, too, and when he
came over to my office in the
Mason block he'd sneak out the
side door of the hotel and In the
back door of the office. We were
keeping the negotiations quiet.
And we did keep 'em quiet, too.
"Once we had a big banquet In
my office —paid a waiter $20 just
to serve the turkey—and had
most all the big men of the Union
Pacific there, and the newspaper
men never knew a thing about it.
"But Adams himself? Oh, he
was just like other folks, to talk
with. He did have that sarcastic,
stand-off way that people said,
but it didn't, seem to me that
meant anything.
"I recollect he said he
wished he could move the
gravel off of the American
lake prairie to ballast his
road in Nebraska.
"Jim Hill—l don't recollect
when he came to Tacoma—but I
saw him in Seattle. That was
1893, the year of the panic; and
I could have unloaded most of
my holdings on Jim Hill right
then if I had wanted to. But I
was hoping, like a lot of the rest
of us, that we could get the Great
Northern to come to Tacoma, so
and saw him.
"He was Just like you've seen
I took my maps and went over
his pictures—dressed like a far
mer and looked a good deal like
one. He gave me a cigar and
smoked one himself, and we talk
ed the whole thing over. He had
a sharp, decisive way of talking,
and he knew the situation all the
way through.
"liarriman of the Union Pa
cific ■ came about six or seven
years ago, I should say. That
was about the time the U. P.
bought its terminals from the St.
Paul & Tacoma Lumber Co.
"Somehow I don't remember
anything about Harriman that
one could call remarkable. I do
remember that he stayed in his
private car down In the yards, be
cause that was where I saw him.
"Yes, they've all been here, and

is only one choice between Humphrey, pleading

whose names mightn't be quite
as well known. Tacoma always
had to be reckoned with when
there was anything in the railroad
line under consideration, and a
lot of 'em have sat here, one time
and another, and sized us up, just
like old John D. did."
Another
Bump for
Humphrey
Will E. Humphrey, congress
man, candidate for the U. S. sen
ate, and now the laughing stock
of Seattle, today bumped up
against another challenge.
Th|s time it is a challenge from
U. S.,,Senator Miles Poindexter to
meet .in joint public debate on the
subject of the tariff and "any
other campaign issues Humphrey
may care to discuss."
Tbie challenge was sent to
Humphrey at the request of Poin
dextar's friends.
The evening of Sept. 9 is sug
gested as the tine, and Seattle

WILL SPEAK HERE

ATTORNEY RULES THAT
17 HIGH OFFICIALS ARE
ILLEGALLY APPOINTED
Seventeen prominent city official, ranking next in Importance to the
mayor and four commissioners, either must take civil service examination!
for their positions or get out of the city employ.
This is the substance of an opinion given the civil service commission Tues
day afternoon by City Attorney U. K. Harmon. The opinion supplement! a
former one in which the city attorney ruled that 15 police officials who had
been promoted without examination would have to pass the strict tests of the
civil service examiner! or suffer demotion.
Ah a result of Harmon's opinion, the civil service commission, at. a special
meeting Tuesday afternoon, began the task of re-classifying all municipal po
sitions, ami prepared to hold examinations for the 17 different jobs mention
ed v Harmon's letter.
Among the prominent officials who hold their positions illegally, accord
ing to Harmon, are Electric Supt. Lllewellyn Evans, Water Supt. Paul Sav
idge, Supt. of Streets and Bridges H. J. McGregor, Harbormaster Rowland,
and Assistant City Treasurer E. E. White.
Ordinances Not Valid, He Says
Harmon bases his opinion on a section of the charter which provides that
only the city commissioners, the mayor's secretary, the chiefs of police and
fire departments, and heads of such other departments which shall be created
in the future, shall be exempt from civil service.
The council has passed several ordinances dividing and subdividing the dif
ferent municipal departments, and allowing commissioners to make appoint
ments of officials to head these sub-divided departments. According to Har
mon, these ordinances were passed for political reasons, in order that politi
cal friends could be given jobs. In reality, no new department! of the city gov
ernment have been created since the charter took effect, and all of these ap
point incuts are illegal.
In his opinion Tuesday, Harmon advises the civil service board that it
should not recognize those officials whose jobs have been made apointive by
means of illegal ordinances.
"It is a terrible jumble, and I do not know what will be the finish," said
City Attorney Harmon Tuesday. ,
Many Other Good Jobs Included
"But there is no doubt that city jobs have been juggled so that political ap
pointments could be made. The charter absolutely enumerates those positions
that shall be exempt from civil service. All other employes must take exami
nations for their positions, or they cannot draw salaries.
"When we get this mess threshed out, we will have our city offices held by
competent men who have passed civil service examinations. Until that time
we are bound to have some political appointees whose ability is a negligible
quantity." i
Among the other city officials who must take examinations for their pres
ent jobs, or lose their fat municipal salaries, are Chief Clerk Bradley of the
public works department; Supt. J J. Monahan of the water works; Milk and
Meat Inspector Button; Boiler Inspector Albert Johnson; Chief Clerk Kreger
of the light and water department; Storekeeper Knatvold of the light depart
ment; Assistant Electric Supt. Arquett; Assistant Water Supt. Kunigk;
Supt. of Docks and Wharves L. O. Parks; Chief Deputy Controller Gonyea; and
Supt. Fawcett of the contagious hospital.
Because of the fact that there are no civil service eligibles for any of these
positions at the present time, the incumbents will be permitted to hold their
jobs until after examinations have been held.
