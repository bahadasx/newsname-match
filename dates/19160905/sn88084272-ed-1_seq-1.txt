Washington Memorandum

WASHINGTON, D. C. Sept. 3.
To the proposal of the Entente
allies that neutrals accept the
pi maple that all submarines are ea
sels or war, the United States has dis
patched a reply which, it is understood,
J olds to the principle that the char
acteristics of each individual submer
sible must govern the caw.
At the same time, advices to some
of the diplomats here today announced
f-at Norwav, Sweden and Spam hiu

Memorandum to All Sativum.
The memorandum from the allies
v is sent to all neutral powers. The I
t, , v of the United States. It was
oi fi eiajly stated, was also in the form
o st memorandum and not a formal
note. Copies were sent to each of the
Entente allies.
Allied Arsnmrnl Refuted.
To the contention in the allied mem
orandum that It is difficult, if not
Impoesible, for warships to distinguish
between armed and merchant subma
rines, the American reply is under-
ood to point out that it is equally
difficult to distinguish betw een sailing
irerchant vessels and those which may
have masked batteries.

Athens. Greece. Sept S (via London,
Sept. 4) Seizing the opportunity of
fered by the presence at Piraeus, with
in gunshot of Athens, of a large fleet
of the Entente nations, premier Zaimis
has assumed what amounts to dicta
torial powers. All is now in readiness
for the final act to end the neutralitv

"While the people of Athens were
being amused at the spectacle of allied
sailors and secret police pursuing Ger

found change in the status of affairs
was effected quietly. Premier Zaimis
is now in a position to suing the whole
country as he will.
The first step was taken when he
forbade public gatherings last Wednes
day. The arrangement of Friday,
whereby the issuance of the decree
dissolving the now adjourned parlia
ment and calling new elections w as post
poned indefinitely, disposed effectually
of any parliamentar interference with
the policy of the government.

Enacted Into Law.
WASHINGTON, D. C Sept S.
Drastic amendments to ths
revenue bill, striking at the
allied blacklist and British interfer
ences with American mails, were
adopted today by the senate and cre
ated consternation among' diplomatic
representatives of the entente allies.
In allied quarters it was declared that
the enactment of the amendments into
law- would constitute nothing less than
a non-Intercourse act, preliminary to a
commercial warfare with possibilities
of far-reaching consequences.
Allies AMU Protest.
Until the retaliatory amendments be
come law with the nresidenfs sle-ns-
j ture. the allies technically have nothlng
auvui. wiucb id protest, out tnere are
assurances that representations Willi
be made If the amendments stay In the
bill.
Inasmuch as the government has
decided on a course of legislation tj
meet the restraints on commerce which
diplomatic correspondence has been
unable to remove, it is generally ex
pected the amendments will b put
through.
The administration leaders who have
intimate connections with the govern
ment's foreign policy, made no attempt
to stay their adoption.
