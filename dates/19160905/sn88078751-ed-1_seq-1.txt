London, Sept. 5. North and soutii
of tho Sommo the Anglo-French forces
again havedrlven their lines forward
ttnd captured important German posi
tions. South of Uie 'Somme' the village of
Boyocourt fend part of tho village of
"Vermandovillers have been captured,
while seemingly more important still
tho French have made fresh progress
east of the village of Forest, which
lies one and one-half miles southeast
of the railroad town of Comble-a
gain which, taken -with tho capture of
Guillemont on Sunday, seemingly out
flanks Combles and apparently ran
dors it untenable. More than 5,00.)
Germans have been made prisoners
north and -south of tho-Sommo during
tho last two days.
On the British right wing progress
fa reported north of Fallmont farm
while a Gorman counter attack iirth
west of Moquet farm was repulsed. In
the Verdun sector Paris records a
fresh gain near Floury.
Berlin, in admitting the claims of
British and French successes in the
fighting of Sunday in the Somme re
gion, says the battling over tho eigh
teen mile front from Beaumont to the
Soome was of the greatest ferocity.
The Germans held their ground at
Thiepval, north of Pozlerea and near
Qlnchy, but Guilemonte village and
wood were lost, as likewise was Gin
ohy, but a counter attack of the Ger
mans won back a portion of tho latter
town, the Germans say.

WELSH IS AWARDED
DECISION ON POINTS
While's Adherents Fire Cushions
at the Referee.
Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 6.
Freddie Wolsh retained his title of
champion lightweight pugilist of tho
world after going the full scheduled
twenty rounds with Cballonger
Charllo White of Chicago. Referee
Billy Ilocho of Now York awarded
Welsh the decision on points.
As the gong sounded at the close of
tho twentieth round Itoche stood for
several moments as If undecided. He
then reached out both hands toward
tho boxers, and many of tho specta
tors believed he -was about to award
a draw. Suddenly Welsh rushed ovor
to Roche and placed his glove In the
referee's hand, while tho official ap
peared to be reaching for White. The
sext Instant Jubilant friends of the
champion swarmed Into tho ring.
When Heferee Roche announced his
decision the challenger's adherents ap
peared for the moment spellbound.
Then began a fusillade of cushions
from all directions at the referee. He
was rushed through the crowd by
friends to a waiting automobile.
From a spectacular standpoint the
battle was considered one of tho poor
est that has over been fought for the
highest ring honors In the HghtwoigM
division. For fully two-thirds of tie
time tho fighters were locked in a suc
cession of clinches, pushing each
other back and forth about the ring
For this many spectators thought
Wolsh was largely to blame.
Throughout the contest scarcely a
Wow was struck by either man that
did any damage. Welsh did most of
tho leading.

RICHARD LLOYD JONES V
RICHARD LLOYD JONES
When President Wilson delivered
his speech at Hodgenville, Ky., on La
bor Day he liquidated a New York
state corporation. He went to the
birthplace of Abraham Lincoln to ac
cept from the Lincoln Farm associa
tion the national memorial which this
patriotic society had placed there and
the endowment that went therewith.
When this was done the whole plan
and purpose of this organization In
corporated under the laws of New
York was done. Twelve years ago
Richard Lloyd Jones then associate
editor of Collier's Weekly and now
editor of the Wisconsin State Journal,
as a student of the life of Lincoln,
visited the birthplace of Lincoln In
the heart of Kentucky. He found the
Cedar Point. O., Sept 5. With a
left on the jaw, followed quickly by a
right to the pit of the stomach. Cham
pion Johnny Kllbane put George
Chnney of Baltimore down to stay
after 2 minutes and 42 seconds of the
third round had elapsed. Referee Hiu
Me, in tho ring, immediately aftev he
had counted Chancy out, said thnt the
blow that did tho damage traveled
less than six Inches.
The result was never in doubt after

property In a sad state of neglect and
Involved In court litigation of a
wealthy New York restaurant owner
who had a few ye"ars before bought
the property, taking the cabin from
Its original site to exhibit It at var
ious fairs and expositions around the
country, including the Chicago world's
fair, the Pan-American exposition at
Buffalo and the world's fair at St.
Louis. On that visit he conceived
the idea of restoring the cabin to its
original site and building over and
above it an enduring granite mem
orial which would protect It from the
devastation of weather for centuries
to come. He believed that If this
could be done the story of Lincoln's
first home would find its way Into the
tho first minute of tho first round.
Kllbaue started right out in front and
steadily Increased his lead In the bat
tle until the eventful termination of
the third round. He hit Chaney when
ever and wherever he cared and real
ly made the Baltimore challenger look
ridiculous with his loft hand constant
ly reaching Chaney's face.
There were few vacant seats In the

this should be done by the people

A year later Mr. Jones returned to
Hodgenville to bid in this farm under
the auctioneer's hammer. He inter
ested Mr. Robert J. Collier of New
York in his idea and they, with Clar-
.Lencc- H. Mackay, the president of the
Postal Telegraph company, organized
the Lincoln Farm association, open
ing offices In New York city from
which thy made an appeal for con
tributions to the people of the coun
try, issuing a certificate of member
ship In the association to all who
contributed 25 cents or more. In this
way over 400,000 Americans gave
over $400,000 for this work.. It Is ex
pected that some national service will
be held at this birthplace shrine dur
ing each presidential administration
and every president of the United
States will pay his tribute to the
great Lincoln from the terraced steps
of this memorial building on the pedi
ment of which is inscribed the leg

at New London, Conn.
New York, Sept 5. The American
Mexican parleys, out of which the ad
ministration and the dc facto govern
ment of Mexico hope to bring settle
ment of the past four years' friction,
got under way here. All of the con
ferences here, however, are merely
preliminary to discussion of the points
at Issue. These later discussions will
be held at New London, Conn.
The American commissioners are
prepared to change their front. Pre
mature knowledge by the Mexican
representatives that General Funston
has advised the withdrawal of Ameri
can troops from Mexican soil has rob
bed Secretary of tho Interior Lane
and his associates on the commission
of their trump card. It was admitted
that the strongest position that the
administration's men have left is in
sistence on adequate protection of the
border, to balance tho demands of the
Mexican members.
Following the conference it becamo
known that the American commission
ers doubtless will accede to the main
requests of the Mexican commission
that the American troops be with
drawn from Mexican soil.
No reason was assigned for the sud
den change of the meeting placs from
Portsmouth. N. H to New London,
except that the Connecticut city- is
more readily accessible from Wash
Ington.
QUICK THINKING SAVED ARM.
Clerk Jumped Into Mail Conveyer
When Heavy Cord Caught Him.
Chicago. A fast working brain
saved Emll H. Johnson, a substitute
mail clerk at the local postofllce, from
possible serious Injury recently. He
was throwing mall Into an endless
chain conveyor when his nrm became
entangled In the heavy cord of a mail
cock. Swiftly and surely the arm was
being cnrrled into a position where it
would be first broken and then torn
from his body.
Johnson thought quickly and Jumped
Into the conveyor, laid down and rode
with the sack of mall. On the way be
disentangled his arm and when the
conveyor was stopped walked dowu
stairs and resumed his work.

TRAINING UNDER NAVY MEN
Hundreds of Motorboats Start Mimic
War Drills.
New York, Sept. 5. About 500 mo
torboats owned by patriotic citizens
today began a week's practical train
ing off the Atlantic coast under United
States navy officers, in the important
defensive work which these volunteer
midget craft could perform In time of
war. They ar-e operating in conjunc
tion with the- battleships which have
Just completed the civilian training;
cruises and other war vessels.
Boats must- be capable of carrying?
at least three passengers and have a
cruising radius of twenty-four hours.
The boats will do patrolling, niins
planting and sweeping, scouting, act
ing as a defensive screen for battle
ships, counter mining and signaling.
Many well known men have offered!
their boats. Among those are Ralph:
Pulitzer, August Belmont. Jr., R. B.
Roosevelt, William Ziegler, P. L. "Op
John and H. F. Moumiin.
Great Britain has used motorboats
agains submarines effectively, and
navy officials hope to Instruct Ameri
can owners in methods of locating
submarine boats and acting as a pro
tection to other craft, so that they will
be ready for any emergency.
