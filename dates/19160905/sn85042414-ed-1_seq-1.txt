REPLY TO THE
ENTENTE AlUES
Characteristics of Each Sub
\i mersible to Govern,
Says Memorandum.
SUBMARINES
NOT WAR VESSELS
I
Norway, Sweden and Spain
Have Forbidden Harbors
to Sub-sea Craft.
Washington, Sept. 6.—To the pro
posal of the Entente Allies that neu
trals accept the principle that all sub
marines are vessels of war, the United
States will dispatch a reply which it
is understood holds to the principle
that the characteristics of each in
dividual submersible must govern
the case.
At the same time advices to some
diplomats here today announced that
Norway, Sweden and Spain had for
bidden their harbors to merchant sub
marines, on the ground that they
were "Indistinguishable," from war
craft
The memorandum from the allies
was sent to all neutral powers.
The reply of the United States, it
was officially stated, also is in the
form & memorandum, and not a
formal note. Copies will be sent to
each of the Entente Allies.
To the contention in the allied
memorandum that it is difficult, if not
impossible, for warships to distinguish
between armed and merchant sub
marines, the American reply is under
stood to point out that it is equally
difficult to distinguish between sail
ing merchant vessels, which have
masked batteries.

FOLEY BIG SUCCESS IN
CHAUTAUQUA WORK
Gains Instant Popular Favor in Series
of Programs Before New York
Chautauqua.
Reports of the recent successes of
James W. Foley, known as the North
Dakota Riley, in Chautauqua work in
the east, reached here this week, and
is gratifying news to his many friends
throughout the state.
Among his summer's work was his
appearance before the New York
Chautauqua in five programs. His
success was immediate, and he was
heard daily by 1,200 to 5,000 people.
He is known best through his poetic
interpretations of the impulses and
emotions of the child heart. Though
new to the Chautauqua field as an en
tertainer, he has made a distinct suc
cess in this also.
Mr. Foley's mental mind Is a rich
one, with many veins of different
lore. He possesses a humor that is
deep and kindly, which bubbles and
sparkles with wholesome and "uplift
ing mirth. As a distinctly North Da
kota product, no less than as a man,
he and his work are of more than or
dinary interest to the people through
out the state.
Dearth of Prisoners
In Alberta
Jails
Prohibition Act Is a Stimulant
Not a Deterrent of Business,
Says Alberta Man.
That the enactment of the prohi
bition law in Alberta is a distinct
stimulus to business is claimed in a
recent letter to a local brokerage firm
from an Alberta customer. Instead
of tending to decrease business, it has
materially increased it In every line.
The letter goes on to add:
"I cannot recollect having seen any
one under the influence of liquor
since the act went into effect on the
1st of July, and the police records of
all the cities go to show that there is
apparently no drunkenness in Al
berta."
The writer states that the jails are
in most cases empty, and as the terms
of imprisonment expire, it will be
necessary to hire people to take care
of the crops around the jails, where
formerly tihls work was done by those
unfortunates who in most cases came
to the jail directly or indirectly on ac
count of the liquor traffic.
