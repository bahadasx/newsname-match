LIB
VAST CROWDS SAW FOUR NEW
HOMES OPENED FOR FIRST
TIME LAST SUNDAY AFTER
NOON. One thousand five hundred people
last Sunday were present at the open
ing of four new homes recently com
pleted at the corner of G street and
Fourth avenue, southwest. The open
ing was advertised by C. O. Maddox,
and he and a number of gentlemen
were on hand to show the people
through the homes and to point out
the conveniences of construction. But
so many camo that theirs was a hope
less task, and the visitors did their
own entertaining and their own pilot
ing and did not expect courtesies
that would have been extended had
they been fewer In number.
Mrs. John H. Carlock superintended
the serving of punch, and she was as
sisted by Misses Mary Anderson,
Gladys Walling, Mattie Claire Gano
and Annie Thompson. In all, 27 gal
lons of punch were served. Music for
the occasion was furnished by Misses
May Robert and Eunice Smith. One
of the homes was furnished complete
by the Bass Furniture company.
As a result of the exhibit one of
the homes has been sold and deals
are on for the sale of two others.
This was the first attempt ever made
to show houses in Ardmore in this
way, and the plan proved so attractive
that similar events will be common
from this time on.
CLOSED A GREAT MEETING.
Rev. W. T. Freeman Preached a Series
of Spiritual Sermons.
The series of meetings at Carter
Avenue Methodist church closed Sun
day night and the last services were
the greatest of the entire series. As
a result of the meeting, there were
27 additions to the church. Many of
these people are the most prominent
citizens of that section of thd city.
The Influence of the revival will be
felt for years to come, and Rev. W. T.
Freeman is loved more by his congre
gation now than ever before. The
church has demonstrated that It can
hold a great meeting, that it can have
a harvest of souls, without sending
away for a revivalist. Rev. Freeman
has resided here for about ten yr rs
and for four years of that tirr. he
was the presiding elder of the Ard
more district. His preaching durin?
this meeting has been, what hU
friends say, the finest work he has
ever done In the city. His sermons
wer forceful and spiritual and they
aroused the people as Ardmor has
not been aroused before In many
years.

DEFENDS TRAINMEN
Compers, While Praising President 'or
His Efforts to Settle the h!rtilrond
Trouble, Denounces the Atvempt to
Compel Arbitration.
LewisliMi. Maine, Sept. !. In a
Labor Day address here Samuel Com
ix is, president of Hie American Fed
eration (if Labor, praised President
Wilson's administration for its acfieve
nient In the interest of the labor
movement and denounced the decis-
I ions ef the supreme court in the Dan
j bury halters and Arizona anti alien
law caiios, which he pointed out were
pari k Ipated in by Charles K. Ilughs,
I lie republican nominVe. Mo defended
tile attitude of the brotherhoods in
the threatened railway strike and
while he praised President Wilson for
his efforts to settle the controversy he
unqualifiedly denounced any attempt
at legislation to compel arbitration.
"The demand of the railroad broth
(ilioods is ii clear cut Issue," he said.
"They now make the simple demand
that their lives and their physical well
being shall be protected and that they
shall be required only to work such
a reasonable period of time as indus
trial experience has shown to be ex
pedient. For tho eight hour principle
has been universally accepted by so
ciety.
"The railroad brothel hoods have
not refused to accept arbitration.
They have declared that the eight
hour day involves a principle of hu
man welfare that cannot bo disputed
and therefore cannot be arbitrated.
They are willing to submit every other
Issup, all of which are arbitrable, to
a mutually satisfactory tribunal.
"They have made a virile, straight
forward fight and they deny that rail
road presidents or managers ought to
be given the special privilege or the
advantage that would accrue from
compulsory arbitration. Their posi
tion is in accord with the position of
the American Federation of Labor.
"The effectiveness and the possibili
ties of the organized labor movement
have never been more clearly demon
strated than they have by recent
events. There Is no limitation to the
possibilities of economic influence.
The fact that has been demonstrated
by the present Kuropean war Is that
all bedrock power Is economic.
"As the labor movement progresses
slowly on the principles of freedom,
humanity and justice, there Is no de
mand of labor that does not represent
years of suffering, struggle and heart
burning desire.
"In a word, though tho trade union
movement may to some be a seeming
ly slow course In the attaining of the
rights and the Justice and the free
dom to which the toilers are entitled,
it is the sure growth. It has in it all
the elements of the human heart hu
man brain and the human soul. It
goes down to the deepest depths of
misery and helps lift up the submerged
that they may take their places side
by side with the great struggling
masses of the toilers."

Washington, D. C, Sept. 5. Drastic
amendments to the revenue bill, strik
ing at the allied blacklist and British
interference with the United States
mails, were adopted by the senate and
created consternation among the dip
lomatic representatives of the allies
today.
In allied quarters, It was declared
that the enactment of the amendments
would constitute a non-intercourse act,
preliminary to commercial warfare,
with possibilities of far-reaching con
tequences. Washington, I). C, Sept. 5. An

which the United States is not en

ships which discriminate against
American shippers and to with

such nations bs withhold privileges

other nations and the use of the army

OF VESSEL
U. S. DOES NOT ACCEPT THE
PRINCIPALE OF ENTENTE AL
LIES THAT ALL SUBMARINES
BE' CONSIDERED WAR VESSELS.
Washington, D. C, Sept 5. To the
proposal of the entente allies that
neutrals accept tbe principle that all
submarines are vessels of war, the
United States has dispatched a reply
which it Is understood holds to the
principle that characteristics of each
individual submersible must govern
the case.
Labor Day Spent Quietly Here.
Labor day passed off very ouletly
In this city. Aside from a few private
picnics and fishing parties, nothing
further was attempted to celebrate
the event The day was ideal, and
many union men who were compelled
by circumstancs to remain In the city,
deplored the fact that the trades "
unions did not attempt to have a fit
ting celebration at one of tbe parks.
An effort will be made another year
to consolidate the county fair with the
labor unions and have a joint celebra
tion, that Is if the date for the county
fair can be so arranged as to Include
the first Monday in September which
is problematical, as that would bring
the opening date of the county fair
too early. It may be, however, that
the date for the fair may be deferred
until later In the month, and thereby
give the trades unions a chance to
have their celebration at the usual
time. The argument advanced toward
having the fair any earlier Is that
crops are not all matured, and the
exhibits might be cut short on this ac
count; however satisfactory arrange .
ments may be made.
