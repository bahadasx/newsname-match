RETALIATORY
LEGISLATION
r-- •.
[By J. P. Yoder, United Press Stall
Correspondent]
WASHINGTON, Sept, 6.—With al
lied diplomats in Washington pro
testing against retaliatory legislation
already enacted by congress to offset
the British blacklist, the senate to
day struck two more blows. Amend
ments adopted to the revenue bill are
likely, some officials believe, to result
in official objections taking the place
of the private, though positive pro
tests against retaliation which cer
tain diplomats here have voiced.
The first act today was passage of
Senator ThomaB' amendment to the
revenue bill empowering the presi
dent to retaliate against any bel
ligerent commerce ship that discrimi
nates against American shippers and
exporters.
The second was adoption of Sena
tor Phelan's amendment to the same
measure refusing rights of the United
States malls or the facilities of any
Interstate express company or of aiiy
wireless, telegraph, or cable company
cans.
Both amendments explicitly em
power the president to take these
steps "whenever, during existence of
a war in which the United States is
not engaged, the president shall be
satisfied there Is reasonable ground
to believe" belligerent governments
have denied all lawful rights to all
American citizens. Violations of both
proposed laws are punishable by fines
of $1,000 or two years imprisonment
or both. Both admittedly are retalia
tory measures against Great Britain's
blacklist and seizure and detention of
mails.
The Thomas amendment was drawn
with the approval of the state depart
ment and the president is empowered
by Its terms to use "any part of the
land and naval forces be deems neces
sary" to uphold it.

WASHINGTON, Sept 5.—Govern

public utilities is coming, in the
opinion of A. B. Garretson, leader of

Lfor an eight hour day. Avoidance of
I a national rail strike, through strong
governmental Interference, be be

steps toward such an end.

in that direction has grown steadily,

Garretson explained that some roads

Commenting on the Garretson in

of the country said today:
"His statement that this is one
course in the structure is mild. It
appears to me that this law has about
