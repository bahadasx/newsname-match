A committee representing the union employees of the Interborough .

of Carmen met this afternoon. In a hall at No. 1 10 East One. -Hundred .
and Twenty-fifth Street to perfect platis for a strike on the subway and

upon entering into a contract or working agreement with each individual'
In its employ.
Tho union leaders sent to tho Public Service Commission this nfternoojj
a formal complaint that Uio New York Hallways Company has violated the-;
terms of the agreement which settled the strike on Aug., 7. The purpose of
this protoit apparently la to open u way by which' tho motormen and Cdp.;,
Unctors on the "green lino" cars can be called out In sympathy with thw.
etlbay and "I" worker.

Interborough, each sldo declared ad-' ancca that there la no possibility of
horence to contentions which can
hnvo but ono result a strlko order
on tho Intcrhorough underground and
overhead lines.
Organizer W. I. Fitzgerald of the
carmen's union has sent for Samuel
Gompers, President of the American
Federation of Iibor, who Is In Malno,
but Is expected here to-morrow. May-
or Mltchrl also has been summoned ,
fiom Plattsburg In the faint hope
thut ho can find a way out of a sltua-
revognir.n a fundamental principle
advanced by tho other.
Fitzgerald, his counsel and sevoral
of Ills union associates called at the
City Hall to-day on their wuy up.
town from tho fruitier conforence.
Fitzgerald s v Acting Mayor Howling
and Major Mltchcl's secretaries nnd
then said:
"It Is very important that Mayor
Mitchel : l return to New Vork at
onco. He has our pledgo that wo will
not nil a strike without consulting
him and we are going to live up to tt."
"If there wero no plixlge, would you
call a strike at once?" Fitzgerald was
asked.
"I can't talk about what I would
do," h replied.
CONFERENCE ALMOST PRECIPI
TATED STRIKE.
The conference almost precipitated
a strike despite tho pledgo to the
Mayor. At ono stage General Man
ager liedley threatened to discharge
tho entire union committee of thirty
six emplojees right whero thoy stood
and then hao them thrown out of
his otfirv. Such nn action undoubted
ly would have resulted In n strlko
order within half an hour.
From reports that havo reached
hcadquarteru tho union leaders plan,
If tha subway management manages
to keep trains running In tho event
of a strike, to call out tho employees
on tho Interborough surface lines In
Manhattan, and also the oinployees ot
tht surface lines ot Queens and Rich

Tho union leaders have also threat-
a atrlko on tho Brooklyn lines.
WANTS THE SUPPORT OF
QOMPERS.
Fitzgerald hna a double object In
calling on Samuel Gompers. Presi
dent William II. Mahon of the AmaL
gnmnted Union Is In Buropa and
Fitzgerald hesitates about ordering a
great strike on his own responsibility.
rurinermore. he wants a pledge of
support from the American Federa-
tlon of I-abor.
Fitzgerald announced to. day that a
aurerence or a day or two in calling
a strike doesn't matter, because the
union Is strong enough to make a
Btrike effective under any circum
stances. Hp also said that the action
of tho Interborough in employing and
massing strikebreakers and appealing
for police protection and the mtlltla
Is strengthening the union and bring
Ing about a situation which will. If the
men desert their posts, be as much,
ot n lockout as a strike.
