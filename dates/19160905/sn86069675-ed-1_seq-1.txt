' Through the efforts of President
Woodrow Wilson the mammoth rail
Tokd strike that had been called for
Monday morning and which would
hnve 'caused untold loss and suffer
ing was e"nlled off by hc unions in
terested Saturday night.
The Adnmson eight-hour dny bill,
exacted from Congress last week
by the railroad brotherhoods ns the
price of calling off the nntion-wido
strike ordered for Monday, was
signed by President, Wilson Sunday
in his private car at the Union Slu
ion where ho stopped on his way
from Shadow Lawn, N. J. to Hod-
genville, Ky. That there may bo no
question uh to the legality of the
measure as a result of it having
been signed on Sunday but the
President will affix his signature
again upon his return to Washing
ton today.
How long peace shall reign ns n
result of the bill apparently is de
pendent upon developments in the
proposed move to test the constitu
tionality of the act. Should the
railroads take no action, but await
the beginning of the investigation
of the working' of the eight-hour
day by the special commission for
which the measure provides, the
brotherhoods will remnin inactive.
The employes' leaders declare Jiow
over, that should the law bo held
unconstitutional and the railroads
attempt to restoro the ten-hour dny
on their lines, a strike will follow
promptly.
Brotherhoodi-head!' in a circular
letter to their members made no
comment on the measure passed.
They merely pointed out that it
would not become effective until
next January 1, and that many
things might occur between, now
and then which would change ma
terially any suggestions or comment
they might make.
