Joo Stechcr, champion wrestler of
tho world, made, his Initial bow be
fore a Nortli Platto audience at the
ball park yesterday afternoon and ex
hibited his prowoss on the mat by tak
ing two falls out of Ed Davis, of In
dianapolis. Both falls were by tho
scissor and half Nelson holds, tho first
occurring in Boven minutes, the second
in four and a half minutes. Dnvls put
up a stiff fight in tho first encounter,
but in tho second his efforts were pure
ly on tho defensive, and ho was almost
holplcss in the hands of tho powerful
Stepher.
As the men woro Introduced by Ref
eree J. T. Iveofe, they were given a
hearty applause, Stcchor, as a Nebras
ka boy, receiving tho most generous
welcome Davis is two pounds heavier
than Stecher, but Is an Inch shorter.
Hq really looked the stronger of the
two, but Stecher had tho muscle,
strongth and 'wind that counts. Davis
failed to show up as strong as was ex
pected, for he has an enviable mat
record.
Tho two preliminaries wore good, in
fact :to somcthoy were more enjoyable
than the main event for tno reason that
tho .contestants! mt:u more evenly
matched and thoy lasted longer.
Luttberg, of Omaha, toor: two falls "but
of Tom Hume of Now York, the first'
In ten minutes, the second in fourteen
and one-half minutes, Hume was tho
quicker actor but his opponent had
strength and weight In nis favor.
The bout between Ray Trnbert and
"Dutch" Munaver of Alliance, was full
of vinegar and tho men Worked faith'
fully and well for thirty minutes with
out securing a fall. v
The crowd attending was a dlsap
polntment to the promoter of tho
exhibition, Carl Kramor, of Fremont,
and to tho local committee who as
sisted in tho arrangements. Tho at
tendance of out-of-town peoplo WU3
fairly good, but the number of North
