BIG DAY IN CASEY
GOOD CROWD HEARS SPEECHES
FROM BOTH PARTIES
Senator Montgomery Introduces
Congressman Helm and Day
Is Big One For Democracy
Both the democratic and republi
can campaigns were pitched at Lib
erty Monday. Congresman Harvey
"Helm, of this city, and Hon. W.
Preston Kimball, of Lexington, spoke
for the democrats and Hon. W. C.
Owens, republican nominee for Con
gress from the Louisville district,
for the G. 0. P. The latter gentle
man was the first speaker. He was
introduced by Dan A. Taylor, bro
ther of Dr. Taylor, the veterinarian
of this city, who referred to Maj.
Owens as the "roaring Senator from
Louisville."
The crowd was largely republican
but notwithstanding that Maj. Ow
ens could not hold it, many leaving
before he had spoken fifteen minutes.
A gentleman who heard him, says
that his speech was most disappoint
ing. He lambasted President Wilson
for not bringing about war with
Mexico and declared that he had
suffered the great flag of the na
Hnn tn he tramnlpd underfoot: that
President Wilson has submitted his
people to such indignities as were
shameful. Like Presidential Nominee
Hughes, Maj. Owens found fault
with everything the present admin
istration has done and proved him
self a knocker almost equal to the
"'Knocking Bird," Charles E.
Hughes. It was evident that the
speech made no converts and must
have disappointed the leaders of the
republican party, who had expected
so much from the One-Term Con
gressman's effort.
It was then announced that the
democrats would have their inning
and again the court-house was
crowded. Senator Charles F. Mont
gomery, who had been chosen mas
ter of ceremonies, introduced in a
fitting, but brief speech, Hon. W. P.
Kimball, who made a telling talk of
an hour or more. Mr. Kimball is a
most fascinating speaker and never
fails to get the interest of his audi
ence. His references to President
Wilson were received with applause
many republicans joining in the
clapping of hands. Mr. Kimball told
of the great work accomplished un
der the Wilson administration and
gave many reasons why the great
man and greater President should be
kept in power. It was a superb effort
and good results bay be expected in
November from Mr. Kimball's speech.
Senator Montgomery then intro
duced Hon. Harvey Helm. Said he
"I am introducing to this magnifi--'cient
audience -a splendid democrat,
an excellent gentleman and our
democratic nominee for Congress.
He was not my first choice for the
nomination, as you all know, but I
want to say he is my choice now and
I shall work for him until the polls
close in November."
He then presented Mr. Helm. Sen
ator Montgomery's remarks were re
ceived with deafening applause, for
they showed plainly that there were
no sore spots on him; that he is a
game loser and can give hearty sup
port to the gentlman who bested
him.
Mr. Helm mude a good, clean,
democratic speech. He reviewed his
record in Congress, told of the ac
complishments of President Wilson
in securing beneficial legislation,
lauded him for keeping us at peace
with the word, and thanked his stars
for such a man for the head of the
nation. At the conculsion many of
Mr. Helm's friends grasped his hand
and pledged their support of him and
the entire ticket this fall.
It was democratic day in good,' old
Casey and if that county is not
found in the democratic column after
the votes are counted some two
months hence, many knowing ones
will be both surprised and disap
pointed. Hustonville
Bailey Hill and wife, of Stanford,
were guests in our town last week
for a few days.
Gus Geiszl, of Crab Orchard, the
road contractor, is here with his ma
chinery and a large force of work
men getting out rock on the Adams
farm on the Middleburg pike to put

J. A. Benedd, of Danville, was in
town a few days ago and had with
him a Turkish dog, four months aid,
which born on the waters. It attract
ed lots of attention.
Two houses owned by colored peo
ple burned down at six o'clock Thurs
day afternoon. They were the homes
of James Baldock and James Jones.
Baldock's house was almost ready to
fall in when discovered. They were
eating supper and had a narrow es
cape. Everything was destroyed. The
house of Jones was destroyed, but
the households goods were saved.
" The force of Gus Geiszl, that was
working nearby rendered great as-

How to Give Good Advise.

is to set a good example. When oth

PRESIDENT AT HODGENVILLE
Notwithstanding the fact that
Lincoln county's two official dele
gates, George D. Florence and S. M.
Saufley, were both prevented by
illness from attending the Lincoln Day
ceremonies at Hodgenville Monday,
scores went from this county, most
going through in autoes to see the
President and witness the ceremonies.
President Wilson, on behalf of the
nation, accepted the farm near
Hodgenville, Ky., where Abraham
Lincoln was born, the Memorial
Hall that shelters the historic log
cabin and the maintenance fund of
$50,000 to conserve the property as
a national shrine. His address was a
panegyric upon Lincoln and a tribute
to his great Americanism, with elo
quent counsel for a continuance of
the spirit of democracy in which he
said: "Here we may forever keep
alive the vestal fires of democracy as
upon a shrine at which some of the
deepest and most sacred hopes of
mankind may, from age to age, be
rekindled." The President spent an
hour sightseeing in Louisville on his
return from Hodgenville and depart
ed at 5 o'clock Monday for Washing
ton. He was welcomed by cheering
crowds at every place "where he ap
peared throughaut the day
BIG STRIKE CALLED OFF
The proposed great railroad strike
was called off late Saturday night,
when the Adamson Eight-hour Day
Bill, accepted by labor union offi
cials as providing a satisfactory set
tlement of the demands on which
they based their order calling a nation-wide
railroad strike for Mon
day, was passed without an amend
ment that night by the Senate by a
vote of 43 to 28. It was signed by
President Wilson immediately. Short
ly after the vote in the Senate the
brotherhood leaders in Washington
started out their code messages or
dering the various general chairmen
to cancel the orders for a walkout at
7 o'clock Monday morning. Lifting
of the previously ordered freight
embargoes on the part of the rail
night after the action in Washington.
Managers of the Western railroads
announced that there would be no
precipitate court action on the part
to test the Adamson law, but indi
cated that the matter would eventu
ally find its way into the courts.
A MISTAKE IN SCHOOL DATE
It should have been Sept. 4th and
not 14th that the Hustonville grad
ed and high school opened, as was
erroneously stated in the I. J. last
Friday. Reports irom the West End
are thattheenrollment on the open
ing day was very satisfactory and
the new term starts out most aus
piciously. The Board of Trustees
has secured a splendid faculty, head
ed by Prof. S. S. Robinson and a
most successful session is anticpated.
At Crab Orchard the school term
also reconvened with a large atten
dance of the little ones. Prof. U. G.
Hatfield is at the head of a splendid
institution, has a very competent
faculty and the school seems in for
one of the best years of its history.
LOCAL POULTRY GETS MONEY
John O. Reid, proprietor of the
Lombardy Heights Poultry Farm
swept the platter almost clean with
his pens of pure bred birds at the
Nicholasville fair last week. He re
turned home with 43 blue ties, 19

"Davy" Goes to The Bat
Notwithstanding Raw Deal His Par
ty Gave Him In Recent Primary
Dr. R. L. Davison, of this pity
proved the quality of his old-fashioned
republicanism .in no uncertain
fashion Monday. It will be recalled
that Dr. Davison "also ran" for the
republican nomination for congress
in this district at the recent primary,
and naturally his friends are not in
the best humor in the world at the
treatment which was accorded him
by many of the so-called republican
leaders of the district. Monday
morning Dr. Davison received a
phone call from Republican head
quarters at Louisville, that a Repub
lican speaker was badly needed at
Winchester. It was county court day
there, and some sort of mix-up oc
curred over the date, and no speaker
was ready. Dr. Davison was not
ready either with a prepared speech,
but he again proved the contention
of his friends when they were urg
ing him as the right man for the
congressional nomination that the
"night is never too long or the way
too dark" for Doc. to go to the aid
of the G. O. P., and he told the party
headquarters that he would gladly
go to Winchester and speak. He
took the morning train and went over
to give 'em what he and others of
the "Old Guard" call the "old-fashioned
gospel" which, of course,
sounds mighty good to the members
of that party and puts the pep in
them with a big P, though of course,
is regarded as the veriest poppycock
by us Yellow-dog democrats. Any
way Dr. Davison handed it out in
large doses and made 'em like it. The
Doctor is a wheelhorse of his party
and will be right up at the front of
the old pie counter, helping dish out
the "Grapes" to the faithful, in the
! event any such a calamity as the elec
tion of Hughes should take place m
November.
After speaking at Wichester Dr.
Davison headed the delegation from
Lincoln county which went over to
hear Hughes speak at Lexington to
day, G. D. Florence, Dr. Southard, J.
W. Acey and Cal Nevius, George W.
Gentry and others went from Stan
ford, while several auto loads went
through from the south end, the west
and east ends. A special excursion
on the Q. & C. carried a thousand re
publicans from Pulaski and down in
Tennessee.
Latest "War News
The French have made fresh prog

Cattle Market Unstable
Interesting Stock Letter Tells of
Western Markets Conditions
CHICAGO, Sept. 4 Cattle trade
has never been more unstable than
now. Late last week a semi-panicky
condition developed. Cattle could not
be sold at declines of 75c to $1 per
cwt. compared with Monday. Buyers
advanced as a reason shortage of la
bor at packing houses and sporadic
strikes. A heavy run all around the
market circle was a depressin influ
ence. Early this week they were
avid bidders for stale steers at which
they could not be induced to look a
few days before and a sharp reaction
occurred. Hog values have been well
maintained at a slightly lower level
than the high point of the season
last week. In the sheephouse a heavy
supply of western lambs, contracted
for August delivery, has decressed
values of fat grades about $1.25 per
cwt. below the higli spot early in
August.
About 250,000 cattle reached west
ern markets last week and the sea
son's beef roundup is now in full
swing. Kansas City received 71,000
and Chicago 65,000 cattle last week,
the resultant break checking the
movement. Packers are getting thou
sands of grass steers anywhere from
$7 to $8, purchases having taxed lim
ited killing facilities. Revision of
prices in a downward direction has
ben drastic, but lower priced steers
have braved the ordeal better than
$9$10.00 grades on which the de
cline last week was most severe. Now
that the grass movement is well un
der way the market is expected to
acquire a stride.
Values of western cattle did not
experience the sharp decline in na
tives last week and the market is on
a healthy basis at prices current
early last week and but slightly un
der the high point at the opening of
the season. This week the top cut of
the Heinrich cattle from Montana,,
averaging 1,384 pounds, sold at $9,
with the string at $8.65. The major
portion sold at $7.75 with tops at
$8.10. The first Matador consignment
of the season sold at $8.30 for the
dehorned tops and $8 for the rest.
Fat little Mexican cattle are getting
a good reception at $7 7.35. The
run is carrying practically no feeders
and little female stuff.
A sale of Washington yearling
breeding ewes at $10 during the week
indicates high point on the trade.
They went to Ohio. Good aged west
ern breeding ewes are on a $7.50
basis, the general price for native
yearlings being $9.50. Few feeding
wethers are available, one lot going
out this week at $6.75. Feeding year
lings are selling at $7.50 7.75, with
old ewes at $5 5.50. Killing year
lings have lost 25c during the week,
sheep having been out of line. Year
lings are selling largely at $7.758,
wethers $7.50 7.60 and ewes $6.75
7.00.
heifers at $6.25 7.50 constitute the
bulk of current supply. Cornfed
grades and canner stock does not ex
perience these violent changes. There
is a broad demand for canners at
$4.25 4. 60. Bulls had a sharp break
late last week, but have recovered
2535c of the loss, bologna stuff
selling largely at $5.85 6.35. Veals
have lost 50c per cwt. in a week a
few picked bunches selling at $12,
with the bulk at $11.5011.75,
heavies around $7 and middle
weights at $8.50.
After the pyrotechnical display of
last week the hog market has drop
ped into a rut. Fluctations have been
narrow and the spread between com
mon and good hogs shows a disposi
tion to widen. Considering the alti
tude of the market this spread has
been narrow. This week it is $10.40
10.60 market on packing grades,
with shipper and bacon specialties at
$11 11.25. Trash is selling around
$10 and a grade of mixed hogs with
a shipper top anywhere from $10:50
to $11. Quality is steadily deterior
ating, indicating that countv ship
pers are experiencing difficulty in
maintaining a marketward movement
that is sufficient to meet killers'
needs. Pigs are scarce, but the sea
on is at hand when .he market is
usually filled with voung stuff.
Washington, Idaho and Montana
have contributed to a heavy supply
of lambs during the past week, caus
ing a decline of 40c in westerns and
65 85c in natives, the latter being
a poor lot. From the high point at
$11.50 two weeks back top western
lambs dropped this weeks to $10.45.
In the case of natives the $10 quota
tion was eliminated, $9.25 9.75
taking the bulk. Western stuff has
been lightly sorted, packers prefer
ring to buy in straight bands, taking
off the feeder end themselves. The
heavy run has been due to acceptance
by speculators of stock contracted for
August delivery, much of it having
been run prematurely in apprehen
ion of a railroad strike. This week
$10.25 has been a common price ofr
good western lambs.
Feeding lambs sold at Omaha dur
ing the past week at $10.60 and this
week it has been a $10 10.25 market
there, Iowa being a heavy purchaser.
A light class of western lambs is avail
able at Omaha than Chicago, which
warrants higher prices. The Chicago
market is on a $1010.10 basis. The
spread between fat and feeding
lambs has been practically wiped out.
A year ago Omaha's top was $8.50
in August and veterans in the busi
ness refused to buy on that basis.
In August, 1914, the Chicago top
on feeding lambs was $7.40, a rec
ord up to that time. In August, 1901,
1 three-eigntns wools at 4U(a4ic, ass
incr Drices being a cent higher. Mis

$700 For Pair of Mules
Charley Lutes Buys Crack Team
From Harris & Woods
High price mule records of sever
al years' standing in this part of the
state were broken here Saturday
when Charley Lutes, of Goldsboro, N.
C.K paid Harris & Woods of this
city a cool $700 for their pair of
five-year-old mare mules. An I. J.
i representative saw the draft on a
North Carolina bank for the amount
named in the transaction, and Mr.
Lutes expresses the belief that he
iwill sell them in the south for $900.
These are the pair of black show
mules, with which these local mule
breeders have swept the platter
clean at the previous fairs in this
part of Kentucky for several sea
sons. Mr. Lutes will have them ship
ped at once and will probably show
them at several bis: fairs in the Tar
heel state. So far as known, this
price has been equalled in Kentucky
but once this year, and has not been
exceeded.
Ailsa Page Brings $600
Senator Hubble Sells Crack Roadster
Mare to McCray Bros.
Ailsa Page, the crack roadster
mare with which Senator R. L. Hub
ble has been cleaning up the fair
rings in this part of the state this
season, was sold by her owner to
McCray Bros., of North Middleton,
Bourbon county Saturday for $600.
Her new owners will take Ailsa Page
to the State Fair next week, and
show her in the big $1,000 roadster
ring on Tuesday night. They have
had an entry paid for in the big
stake for some time but had no ani
mal to enter. After seeing this mare
perform at several fairs, they de
cided to buy her, and paid a nice
price for her but all who had seen
her work, say she is worth it. The
mare has proven a very profitable
investment for Senator Hubble, who
bought her a year or so ago from
Sterling Curtis for about $300. She
won over $500 on the fair circuit
this season. The competition she will
meet at Louisville will be very keen,
but she looks to have a grand chance
to cop a big part of the money.
ROCKCASTLE DEMOCRATS BUSY
The Democrats of Rockcastle have
organized a Wilson and Marshall
club with seventy-five members. W.
J. Sparks, one of the chief advocates
of the organization of the club, was
made president and E. S. Albright
secretary. All the Democrats pre
sent were enthusiastic and it is the
intention to organize other clubs at
the most important places in the
county. Rockcastle will unquestion
ably give the largest Democratic vote
in November that has been cast for
any Democrat in many years.
At a conference of Progressive
party men held in Detroit, with every
county in Michigan represented,
Woodrow Wilson was indorsed for
President.

Horse trade is still largely, an army
inspection affair. Early this week the
accumulation by foreign governments
at all interior concentration points
was ordered to the Atlantic seaboard.
Common horses not eligible to the
army outlet are hard to sell. In the
inspections business is done at a
range of $115200. Gunners are ap
praised at $160 and up, riders at the
low end of the range. Some trade is
being done in commercial chunks at
$185220. The British, French and
Italian inspections are taking every
horse suitable for cavalry and artil
lery purposes.
Grass cows and heifer declined
about $1 cwt. in sympathy with
steers late last week, but a subse
quent recovery of 25 50c has occur
red. Cows selling at $5.40 6.85 and
is reported in South America.
Corn was strong all last week on
bad reports from the southwest
healthy cash demand and the railroad
situation, new high prices on the
crop being made, but on Monday of
this week prices broke 4c in sympa
thy with wheat. Recovery ensued.
Crop news is conflicting. Cash hand
lers predict a material increase in
the movement. Corn has reached Chi
cago from Illinois and Iowa this week
that was two years old. Trade senti
ment is more mixed than recently
and until the wheat market ettles
down to a more normal condition
nervousness is to be expected. The
Kansas prospective yield is only 50
milion bushels, the smallest with two
exceptions since Kansas became an
important corn State.
Packers are not only clearing out
cellar stocks but are clamorous for
hogs to satisfy contracts, otherwise
the spread between trash and quality
would be wider. Exports of hog prod
uct continue on an extensive scale,
16,490,000 pounds of meats and 6,
110,000 pounds of lard having found
that outlet Jast week, against 9,840,
000 and 6,042,000 pounds respective
ly a year ago. Despite high prices
hogs are cutting profitably and lard
looks legitimately healthy at the re
cent advance. Good hogs are scarce
everywhere and packers' cellars will
be cleared before the winter packing
season begins,
season begins.
A stea'dily decreasing percentage
of good hogs indicates how high
prices have stimulated gathering.
Hogs sell in the country at $10 per
cwt. only at rare intervals and
growers' determination not to over
stay a good market is excusable. The
predicted supply gap is already de
veloping and but for a conspicuous
percentage of trash current receipts
at western markets would be small.
If present prices continue the ad
vance guard of the new crop will
show up late next month at defici
ent weights in anticipation of the
stereotpyed break at the inception of
the winter packing season.
Defends His Policies
President Brands Republican Party
As "Practical and Moral
Failure"
The Republican party was charac
terized as a "practical and moral
failure" in the speech of President
Wilson accepting the Democratic
nomination Saturday at Sfcedow
Lawn, the summer White House. Tfce
President was unsparing in his "criti
cism of the Republican party, defend
ed his foreign and Mexican policies,
reviewed the achievements of his Ad
ministration and declared for "Big
America." Senator Ollie M. James,
of Kentucky, introduced the Presi
dent to a crowd of 8,000 persons,
who interrupted the President with
anplause repeatedly during the course
of his address.
Points in President's Speech.
The time has come for the country
to relegate provincialism and little
Americanism in statesmanship.
The United States in the future
must lend, not borrow; act. not imi
tate, organize and initiate, not fal
low. "Mistakes (in the Mexican policy)
I have no doubt made, but not m
purpose or object."
The Democrats initiated and exe
cuted reforms which the Republicans
never even attempted in their six
teen years of power.
The Republicans were ousted from
the Government because they served
the special interests, not the country.
The situation in Mexico is a test f
the Big Brotherhood policv of the
United States.
The Democrats have carried oet
not only their own program, bet
most of the Progressive platform.
"We are also Progressives," said the
President.
The milwjiv svstem nf the pnimtrvr
must be co-ordinated for the better
service of the nation.
The St. Louis platform is a pledge
and a program.
Referring to hyphenism, the Pres
ident said: "I neither seek the favor
nor fear the displeasure of that
small alien element among us which
nuts loyalty to any foreign Power
before loyalty to the United States."
Points in Senator James Speech
The Wilson Administration des
troyed the Monev Trust and the Pnnio
Trust.
It achieved preparedness.
It passed the Shipping Bill and
cast out subsidies.
It enacted a Rural Credits Bill for
the benefit of the farmer.
It maintained peace with Europe
and with Mexico without sacrifice of
American rights.
It added to the stature and health
of future Americans by enactment
of the Child Labor Bill.
It secured prosperity, with Ameri
can exports now the greatest in. the
world.
It detroyed the powerful and in
sidious congressionl lobby.
"The people know," said Senator
James to Wilson, "that you are un
bossed unowned unafraid."
"When peace shall spread her
white wings over a charred and
bloody world, in the the quiet of the
chamber of the just historian, when
the din and roar of political antago
nism and Dassion of cartisnnshin
shall have died away, when principle
snail actuate men and parties rather
than appetite, when ambition shall
no longer lure men and parties to
unjust attack, the historian will ac
cord to you and your Administration
a foremost place in the republic's
life."
HIT LIQUOR MEN HARD.
(From Pineville Sun)
Middlesboro officials are narrow
ing the path for the liquor men. Not
only have the city commissioners
practically made it impossible to
conduct soft drink stands by recent
legislation; they go farther by re
quiring a license fee of $500 for so
liciting orders or distributing order
blanks for mail order liquor houses,
and providing a fine of $10 for each
order solicted in violation of same.
Don't forget that after Oct. 1st,
the I. J. subscription price will be
$1.50 a year but till then you may
subscribe for as many years in ad
vance as vou wish at $1 a year.
