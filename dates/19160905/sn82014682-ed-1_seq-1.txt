News reached Honolulu some, Cays
made by Secretary xanieis on August
21, three of the submarines at Pearl
Harbor received high mention, wun
the K-8 leading the procession.
On Aueust 21 Secretary Daniels
gave out the "final merit" or relative
standing of every vessel in the United

nery and battle practise during the
last year in the destroyer, submarine,
cruiser and gunboat classes. The
standing Is given by percentage and
does not show the number of hits and

Announcing the standing of the ves
sels the secretary of the navy made
this explanation:
The form of eunnery exercises car
ried out varies from last year, it be
fne necessary to test first experi
ence and knowledge of the person

mniratlon: third, to develop weaK-
nesses in methods of preparation, and",
f mirth tn test one or more features of
design of material. As the conditions
change from year to year, necessarily
the standard must change to fit these
conditions, and in the analysis of the
work of the fleet, standards for dif
ferent narts of the work and for the
different forms of eunnery exercises
are established from direct data ob
tained from the actual performances
of the vessels themselves. To deter

performance and the merit is ob

BOY SCOUTS IN

SPLENDID WEEK
Sixteen-Mile March to Kailua
Made in Good Time and
Good Order
(Special to Star-Bulletin)
CAMP GUILD Kailua, Oahu, Sept.
5. To the stirring notes of the camp
bugler, the slxtbj annual camp of the
Honolulu Boy Scouts of America was
arod-ariy-ti;C3riortng:fw,r a- fall
day of camp activities. The night in
camp was 'a quiet one and after taps
little was heard from any of the
troops. Every boy and scoutmaster
was ready for the "lights-out" at nine
o'clock.
The. hike over from Honolulu was
a strenuous one on most of the troops.
The troops were in charge of Senior
Scoutmaster Geo. C. Potter, acting in
the absence of Commissioner Harry S.
Hayward, who took care of the strag
glers and the smaller boys who found
the Jong hike a bit too much for
them.
The sixteen miles to Kailua were
made in good time. The legion march
ed to the beat of Troop Two's drum
mer, Alec Perkins. "Pop" Hutton,
scoutmaster of the famous Four
Troop, and Riley Kuehn, Troop IX,
lined up the march with marching
songs on the bugle.
Scoutmaster Potter made the march
easy by systematic rests, marching
25 minutes and resting five. Lunch
was eaten just beyond the Pali at
12:30 and after a rest of half an
hour the trooos "hit the trail' with
new "pep" and arrived at the camp
only a few minutes after schedule
time. The 'legion formed just before
the beach . was reached and were
drummed into camp, greeted by the
cheers of the Headquarter Troops,
which an advance guard looking
after th ' preliminaries of the bag
gage am. camp equipment Sgt
Sanderson,' scoutmaster of the Waia

GERMAN HEADQUARTERS, Sept.
4. Yesterday morning in Somme dis
trict, an Anglo-French attack resulted
in the largest battle extension and
serious fighting north of river on
about 30 kilometers front from Beau

ed enemy's thrusts on both sides of
Ancre and especially againBt Thiep
val and northwest of Pozieres our
gallant troops under Gen. von Stein
and Baron von Marshall's command
maintained all ihe positions.
Temporarily lost ground near Farm
Moughet : was reconquered by rapid
counter attacks. The enemy suffered
heaviest losses. Further eastward,
our strong artillery held down the
enemy trenches. Only in the night
time, the enemy succeeded to sally
forth near Foureaux wood, being later
repulsed.
After fire preparation which exceed
ed all ammunition expenditure known
up to now, a combat developed be
tween Ginchy and Somme which
raged until late into the "night hours.
The aeroic resistance of Gen. von
Kirchbach's and von Fassbender's
troops met the enemy who entered
and completely destroyed the first
line. Each yard of terrain was con
tested and the enemy's push halted in
the second line.
Guillemont and Deforest now in the
enemy's hands.
South of Somme: Our artillery suc
ceeded in frustrating all enemy's at
tempts except in the district south
west of Garleux, where the attacking
enemy was bloodily repulsed.
East of Meuse: French attacks
against Ouvrage and Thiaumont and
southeast of Fleury failed. On Sou
ville gorge, we cleaned out, after care
ful preparation, the salient corner of
a French position. Eleven officers
and 90 men were prisonered. Enemy's
counter attacks were repulsed.

The senate in session today adopted amendments to the revenue
bill which are of far-reaching significance and importance. They
authorize the presidents during any war in which the United States

shippers. The president is emjowered to authorize orders withhold-,
nig privileges 'from .ships of such nations as are withholding from
Americau ships the-privileges accorded the vessels or shippers of
other nations.
Placing the jMwer of thf United States behind the proposed law,
theif is a provision authorizing the president to use the array and
luivy if necessary to prevent the departure of offending vessels or
vessels. of nations discriminating against American trade.
The president is authorized to deny the use of the mails, express,
telegraph, wireless and cables to citizens and subjects of nations not

hampered traffic iu mails."
This provision, it is declared, is "aimed particularly against
Jlritish interference with American mails.
The diplomatic reiji-esentativcs here of the Allied powers are
in consternation at the emphatic language and implication of the
amendments adopted today. It is declared in Allied quarters that
