BRITISH TRADE
WAR ON U. S.
Passes Laws Dealing Double
Blow to Discrimination
Against Americans.
WOULD DENY USE OF MAILS
Emergency Measure Empowers
President - to Retaliate
Against Belligerents.
The United States, through the
Senate, today struck a do'uble blow
at Great Britain's alleged illegal
acts against Americans. Legisla
tive action, it was declared, had
been taken only after diplomacy
hid failed to prevent operation of
the British blacklist and seizures
and detention of United States
mails.
The first act today was passage
of the Thomas amendment to the
revenue bill empowering the
President to retaliate against any
belligerent commerce ships that
discriminate against American
shippers and exporters.
The second was adoption of Sen
ator Phelan's amendment to the
same measure refusing rights of
the United States mails or the fa
cilities of any interstate express
company or of any .wireless .tele
graph or cable company to the
citizens of belligerent countries
which discriminate against Amer
icans. BACKED BY ARMED FORCE.
Without a roll call Senator Thomas
amendment to the revenue bill was
adopted empowering the President to
refuse clearance to belligerent mer
chantmen which decline cargo space to
American goods unleaa such refusal Is
made through lack of cargo apace. In
the event a ship captain attempts to
clear against sucl Presidential order he
Is subject to 110,000 -fine or two years'
imprisonment, or both, and the ship can
be seized by the United States.
The amendment was drawn with the
approval of the State Department and
the President la empowered by Its terms
to use "any part of the land and naval
forces he deems necessary" to uphold
it. It is admittedly an emergency meas
ure aimed directly at the British black
list, and was put through after the
Senate had been informed diplomacy
had failed to obtain relief for black
listed American firms.
The clause giving the President power
to use the army and navy was Inserted,
It backers explained, to fight possible
seizure of American ships or further
discriminatory action against American
firms In belligerent countries.
Piece of General Legislation.
The amendment adopted today Is a
more vigorous one than that recent
ly Installed In the Government Hhlp
plng bill. The latter merely given
the Secretary of Treasury power to
withhold clearance of any vessel that
discriminates against Americans. No
penalty la attached.
"The shipping bill admendtnent,"
said Thomas today, "is merely a piece
of general legislation. It Is admit
tedly not specific nor vigorous

Congress Denies
Employes Mileage
Resolution by Buchanan Grant
ing Privilege Is Quickly
Suppressed.
Aa Ineffectual attempt to obtain adop
tion of a resolution to pay all employes
of the Senate and House, Including
clerks to committees and members,
to and from their homes, was made In
the House today.
Congressman Buchanan of Illinois of
fered -the mlloago resolution and asked
unanimous consent for Immediate con
sideration. Congressman Cullop of In
diana promptly objected and that ended
the matter.
Mr. Buchanan said the payment of
mileage to Congressional employes was
"simply a matter of Justice." Member
of Congress receive mileage at the rate
of 20 cents per mile both way.
Under Republican regime each em
ploye of Congress was given an extra
month's pay at the end of each session.
The Democrats, at an "economy cau
cus," abolished this practice, and the
employes have had no perquisites since.

nnd opened the safe by the combination.
OWEN MAY BLOCK PLAN
FQR ADJOURNMENT
Senate adjournment plans were oh a powder keg to
day. Senator Owen insisted he will once more demand a
vote on his corrupt practices act, as soon as the revenue
bill is voted on. This vote is expected about 6:30 o'clock
this evening.
On. the success or failure of Owen's project rests possi
bility of adjournment as planned by tomorrow, or Thurs
day at the latest.
Owen said he believes Kenyon, Norrls, La Follette, and
Borah, on the Republican side, and Lane, Vardaman, and
several other Democrats, will join him in demanding an im
mediate vote or explicit reason why not.
The only fight will be over getting the bill before the
Senate. Even Republican leaders admit it would be passed
"in ten minutes" once it is brought up.
POLICE ARE READY
AS NEW YORK FACES
BIGGEST CAR TIE-UP
Vacations Canceled, Bluecoats
Are Mobilized After All-Night
Conference.
NKW YORK. Sept. 8.-Actlng Police
Commissioner Uodley today ordered 9,000
New York policemen to hold themselves
In readiness for strike duty In casa of a
strike on the subway, elevated, and sur
face lines as the result of today's con
ference between representatives of the
men and the employes.
Police vacations were canceled; orders
wero sent to 400 policemen In the mlll-
taiy training camp at fort wausworin,
and preparations were made to mobilise
automobile trucks and motorcycles for
use by the police department. These
steps wero taken after an all-night con
ference between Godley and the police
captains and inspectors.
In advance of a meeting- today be
tween officials i of the fnterborough
Rapid Transit Company and represen
tatives of the Amalgamated Associa
tion of Pi reel inul niccirli: nail
way Employes to consider the demand
of the, street car men's union that the
company annul contracts signed by the
company's employes at 't ie4uest.
Theodore P. Shonts, president of the
company, has announced that he would
not grant what the union asked.
Graver Than Last Strike.
Unless the street car men's union
should modify Its unqualified demand
that the company cancel these con
tracts, a second traction strike of eveti
greater proportion that that which was
settled through the Intervention of
Mayor Mltchel and Chairman Oscar S.
Straus of the public service commission
on August 7 last, seems Inevitable.
Mr. Hhonta Issued a statement In which
he said:
"It Is obviously Impgsslble to comply
with the demands of the minority rep
resented by the officers of the Amalga
mated Association of Street and Electric
Railway Employes."
The Interborough will adopt the atti
tude that they have not recognized any
union, and therefore It Isn't necessary
for them to consider any outside agency
In contracting with their own employes.
Union's Final Answer.
The union's flnal answer will be Im
mediately to call out all the men em
ployed on the subway and elevated lines.
It Is rumored that a system of flashing
the men operating the trains had al
leady been arranged and that In a
mnrvolously short time the crews would
desert their cars at the stations.
Mr. Shonts. recognising the probability
of another traction war, sent full-page
advertisements to the newspapers last
night, explaining the company's position.
The president of the Interborough an
nounced that all subway, elevated, and
surface lilies In the city probably would
be involved, but he Insisted that the
Interborough could not deal with the
Amalgamated Association of Street and
Electric Railway Employes without vio
lating a pledge that had been made by
the company to about 8,000 employes who
had not Joined the union.

REPORTED
SINKING
HIGH FOOD PRICES
LIKELY TO STAND,
Drop Following Strike Not to
Materialize Until Fall Crop
Is Harvested.
Prices for potatoes and other stnple
articles of food are likely to stay at
their present high level in Washington
for at least a month, and there Is a
strong probability that the cost will
Increase.
This Is the opinion of local commis
sion merchants, who havo examined
the situation with care, and come to
the conclusion that the prices arc not
merely spordic advances due to the
railway strike threat, but bear an Inti
mate relation to the economic law of
supply and demand, and that until the
fall crop Is brought to market, prices
may go up and up.
Dispatches from Philadelphia Indi
cate that this situation Is by no means
a local one merely.. It Is estimated
theie that tuerv will lo no drop in the
price of potatoes for a week or ten
days. Until the middle or end of Oc
tober,' when the fall potato crop comes
on the market, is the local estimate of
the time of the present prices.
All authorities agree, however, in be
lieving that the prices will "stay put"
for some time.
"Irish diamonds" are hrtnglng from
tt.50 to H a sack of 2'j bushels today.
This Is a slight decrease from yester
day's prices, but Monday markets are
almost uniformly higher than the Inter
days In the week, and this fact M
taken to explnin the fall.
Sweet potatoes are high, costing I2.M
to $3 a barrel, while other vegetables
are proportionate.
Capital Wooden Leg
Gets Gigi in Trouble
Artificial Limbs From Washington
Prove Too Much for Italian
Soldier.
ROME, Aug. 14 (by mall).-The
wooden legs that Charles Swain, of
Indiana, salesman for a Washington,
D. C. artificial limb house, brought to
Italy, created all kinds of trouble for
Olgl, an Italian soldier, whose legs
were shot off In the Trentlno.
8 .vain took a sample pair of legs to
the Mlrafleri hospital, ulannlna- to dem
onstrate their worth and men sell a
carload of them to the Italian govern
ment. He hooked tho pair onto Olgl,
who pounded around for an hour be
fore he got the knack of artificial walk
ing and then Btarted on a tour of the
hospital grounds.
After Swain had finished conferring
with the hospital heads he looked about
for Olgl. He was gone, so were tho
legs. Soldiers were sent out to search
for him. They scoured the neighbor
hood but night came on and Olgl and
the expensive artinclal legs were still
missing.
Next morning when the hospital gates
were opened a dirty bundle of rags
was discovered lying In a heap In the
road. It was Olgl.
He had toured all the neighboring
wine shops. The beHt pair of artificial
legs in the world couldn't support the
load Olgl brought back.

GIRLS DROWN
Four Young Men in Motorboat
Are Being Sought by Phila
delphia Police.
MOTHER IS NOT INFORMED
Keeps Long Vigil. Wondering
Why Daughters Do Not
Come Home.
PHILADELPHIA, Rent. 5. Police boats
are patrolling the Delaware river and po
licemen are searching boathuuses today
for four young men.
Meanwhile, two young girls, sisters,
lie dead in their home, the vjctlms of a
"Joke." They wero drowned In the Dela
ware river off Lardner's Point.
The four men were In a motorboat.
One of them snatched the bowline of a
canoe In which the girls were seated and
dragged the craft up-stream at full
speed, overturned It, and then permitted
the victims to sink without trying to
save them. Tho girls were Jennie Mauss-
ner. nineteen, and Alice Maussner, seven
teen. Mother Keeps Vigil.
While the police bout Stokley and sev
eral polico motorbonts grappled for the
bodies in spite of the darkness, and
while their aeaths were the solo topic of
conversation by every one In tho neigh
borhood of their home, the mother of the
girls, u pet dog by her side, on the front
porch of their llrldgo street house, await
ed their return. No one had courage
enough to tell her the truth, and at mid
night she still looked up and down the
stteet for her daughters.
The girls, who were the daughters of
Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Maussner, the
former Inventor und former Kensington
mill owner, remained home while their
father and elder sinter. Miss Madeline
Maussner, went to Anglesea, N. J., for
a fishing trip.
With Elmor and George Milllgan, the
girls went to the rlver.to teat the canoe
which the boya contemplated buying.
The ranoelMfk lltirt voyofrrt tor mar
ly an hciur when n uiutuibuAt, with four
young men. evidently of alien birth,
hove In night. One of the men waved
a rope, as though u Invite tho cotiovlsts
to "hook on," and b towed upstream.
No answer greeted this Invitation, and
the motorboat canto nearer.
So near. In fact, did It nppronch that
Elmer Milllgan had to push It nwuy
with his hand, in ordtr to uvold a col
lision. As he did so, one of the men In
the motorlKuit -matched tho line In 'he
buw of the canoe and called .to the
man nt thf engine to put on the speed.
He did.
For fifteen or twenty yards the canoe
rnlled the water upright, while tho boys
and girls screamed to tho men In tho
other essel to let thorn alone. Then
suddenly the Utile craft win swamped
and overturned. The motorooat. speed
ing along, went fifteen yards farther,
and the canoe was dragged out of the
reach of tho boys and girls, now strug
gling frantically In the water.
' Watch Victims Drown.
Meanwhile the four men In the motor
boat, now standing still In the river,
watched tho victims of their "Joko" In
their fight with death.
Elmer Milllgan was the only one of
the four young persons who could swim.
He caught .lennle Maussner and tried to
hold her heud nbovo water, and while
doing so he saw her sister sink below
the surface.
Then Jennie seemed to lose her reason,
and, uttering pitiful screams, she closed
her fingers tightly about the throat of
the boy who waa trying to rescue her.
The effect was to bring his head under
tho water. He broke away from her and
she sank.
The young man saw his brother strug
gling for the stalled motorboat, the cause
of the drownings. Ho made for the
craft himself, and the two were taken
aboard, only to be told that there were
too many aboard, and that they would
have to be transferred to another boat.
A motorboat attached to the Farragut
Sporting Men's Association, at Cramer
Hill. N. J came along. The Milllgan
brothers were taken aboard, and were
carried to the Wlsslnomlng Boat Club
house, from whence thev notified tho po
lice of the Tacony station.
In tho meantime the motorboat that
dragged the canoe was started at full
speed and disappeared.

"The provision," said Comptroller
Warwick, "relates only to thosii en
listed men tt tho mllltla or National
Guard who were brought Into the ser
vice under tho call of the President.
As members of tho militia or National
Ouord they had no alternative but to
obey the call. It mattered not who was
dependent upon them for support, un
less excused b competent military au
thority they wero In duty bound to re
spond to tho call of tho President.
"It Is for this class of enlisted men
that the benefits of the legislation were

German Front, Sept. 5. -The combined power of the Russian and
Roumanian armies will We unable to breach the Austro-German
lines in the east, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, commander-in-chief
of the central Austro-German armies in the east, declared today.
"This section of the front, as well as the whole eastern battle line Is
impregnable," said the Bavarian commander. "The Russians are
brave. They advance In thick masses. But they suffer gruesome
losses and cannot break through."
Replying to a query as to what effect Roumanla's entrance into the war
will have on the allies, Prince
respondent, and said with enthusiasm:
"The Roumanians have brought themselves into a bad situation. They
will get some unsuspected blows yet. Yes, there will be blows
as well for those who might follow their example." Other officers
along the front expressed similar views. The appearance of a
new enemy has not shaken their confidence in a final victory.
Prince Leopold, though seventy years of age, is robust and in perfect
health. He takes a swim daily and indulges in steeplechasing to
keep in trim.
