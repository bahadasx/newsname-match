Huntington, W. Va., Sept. 5 (On
Board President Wilson's Special

THROUGH THE BACK GATE
FEAR OPEN DOOR
MAY BE CLOSED
Washington Apprehensive OTer the
Threatened Crisis Between China
and Japan.
Washington, Sept. 5. Close watch is
being maintained by diplomatic offi
cials here over the newly threatened
crisis between Japan and China grow
ing out of the rece.it clash of the two
nations' troops at Cheng Chiatun.
Considerable fear is felt that the
rights of the United States in China
mV be affected, in view of confidential
reports that Japan has made other de
mands than those published yesterday
in dispatches from Peking and that the
secret negotiations threaten Chinese
rule throughout inner Mongolia.
An extension to inner Mongolia of
the authority gained by Japan in south
Manchuria by the treaty of May 8. 1915,
involving supervision by Japan of for
eign loans and special privileges for
Japanese resident citizens, might Im
pair seriously the "open door" policy
and the integrity of China, it is point
ed out here.
The Jap-Russ Alliance.
Tokio, Sept. 5. Japan has officially
assured the United States that the al
liance made by Russia and Japan will
not affect the status quo in the far
east.
The Russo-Japanese convention wa3
signed at Petrograd July 3. The Japan
ese foreign office, in reply to a ques
tion from The Associated Press after
the treaty had been signed as to what
effect the alliance would have upon the
"open door" and the integrity of China,
stated :
"The convention Is effectually an
emphasis upon and an extension of the
Anglo-Japanese alliance, based upon
the territorial integrity of China,
whose open door and integrity are
not in danger. American trade and In
terests are in no wise affected."
The foreign office denied affirma
tions in Japanese newspapers that the
convention contained secret clauses.
On Aug. 4 Reuter's Telegram com
pany, limited, announced in London
that it had learned that after the con
clusion of the Russo-Japanese conven
tion a separate agreement was reached
under which Russia sold to Japan the
southern half of the Harbin-Changchun
railway in Manchuria. The addi
tional agreement, it was said, also rec
ognized Japan's rights on the Sungari
river between Kirin and Petuna, in
Manchuria, thus settling a question
pending since the signing of the Ports
mouth treaty.

Rumanians Left .Many Dead.
London, Sept. 6, (12:40 p. m.) The
first day's fighting on Rumanian soil,
due to the invasion of Dobrudja by
Bulgarians and Germans, Is said by
the Bulgarian war office to have re
sulted in the retreat of the Rumanians,
who left hundreds of dead on the field.
As previously reported by the German
war office, the invaders crossed the en
tire Dobrudja frontier and occupied
towns near the border.
The statement, Issued in Sofia on
Sunday, says:
"On our northernTront our armies
on Saturday crossed the entire Do
brudja frontier, energetically driving
back the enemy. We occupied Kurt
burnar after fighting In which we took
prisoners 165 men and two officers.
The enemy retreated, leaving on the
field hundreds of dead as well as a
great number of rifles and a quantity
of material. One of our columns oc
cupied Akkadunlan. The march for
ward is proceeding on the whole line.

fications north of Kavala. Enemy aero
planes dropped bombs on the villages
of Starovo and Hazuatar and on An

Ansfria Had Few Troops Ready.
Paris, Sept. 5, (4:50 a. m.) The ad
vance of the Rumanian troops In the
first five days of their compalgn was
considerable and at some points was as
much as 80 kilometres (about 4S
miles), says a dispatch from Urgent
under date of Saturday to the Petit
Parislen. The forward march, how
ever, now has been somewhat slack
ened because of the difficulty of send
ing revictualing convoys. Although
the ground on the eastern Hungarian
frontier was unfavorable for the Ru
manians, the correspondent said, they
were successful In their dash across
the river and now occupy the valleys.
Rumania's declaration of war, the
dispatch adds, was so unexpected by
Austria that only a few troops of th
dual monarchy were on the Rumanian
frontier. The Rumanian offensive wa
so sudden that the Austrlans had no
time to blow up bridges nor tunnels.
Comparative quiet still prevails at
noon on the Macedonian front today's
official French report says. There
were no infantry engagement yester
day although the artillery as fairly
active and various enterprises were
undertaken by patrols.
