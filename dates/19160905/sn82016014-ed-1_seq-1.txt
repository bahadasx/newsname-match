Xothing Goes With Malt or
Alcohol in State.
NO MORE TEMPERANCE FOAM i
And All That "Saloon" Talk
Must Be Forgotten.
Back to Phosphates for the
Soda Fountain Boys.
Anything which contains alcohol or
malt and is sold in Kansas as a bev
erage bang' Prepare for War. S. M.
Brewster, attorney general, declared
Uday that all "near beers" were at
once to come under the ban in this
state. Bcvo, Tanhauser and all other
lir.nks must so under the Brewster
edict. Enforcement of an ouster or
der against Anheuser-Busch Brewing
ct mpany, makers of Bevo. is threat
ened. Brewster's sweeping announcement
tt.day followed a conference with a
cioren Topeka women, representatives
of the State Temperance union. They
nit with Brewster and Govwnor Cap
per in the governor's office in the state
ii.iuse. They brought with them sam
ples of Tanhauser. a substitute for
beer, which, according to advertise
ments, contains one-half of one per
cnt of alcohol. They asked the Ftate
to put the lid on Be-o and all similar
"near beer" drinks.
No Tenicraiice Saloon.
Establishment of a "temperance sa
loon" and a Bevo distributing station
in Topeka will be over a protest from
the attorney general and after a red
hot fight in the courts. Brewster de
clared that every effort would be made
to Mock the establishment of the
"temperance saloon" and that persons
selling beverages containing any per
centage of alcohol or malt would be
procuted for violation of the prohibi
tory liquor law.
"L'nder the meaning of the prohibi
ts. y liquor law. the sale, as a beverage,
of any drink that contains any per
centage of alcohol or malt. Is a viola
tion of, the prohibitory law." said
Brewster. "That' means all near-;
beers and other drinks that contain
alcohol in any amount. It means soda
fountain drinks if such be sold and
all other beverages.
Looks for No Trouble.
"1 don't anticipate trouble in en
forcing this order. In fact I think it
will be very easy. There is Bevo, for
instance. The state still holds an
i. inter order against the Anheuser
Itusch Brewing company. That order
(.i !ts the company from doing busi
ness in this state. I don't think that
under the present legal status of the
c-, the company wtll dasire to es
tablish either a distributing station or
a 'temperance saloon' in Xansas. If
Ihiy do well, that's their "business."
Trosecutions will be directed ly the
attorney general against all persons
selling near-beers ir. Kansas. Scores
of letters have recently been received
by Brewster relative to the various sub
stitutes offered in this state. He has
it-fused to give his official approval to
any of the drinks.
"The minute I say a drink is all
riKht. it is advertised broadcast over
the state." says Brewster. "Then the
drink suddenly begins to increase its
percentage ot alcohol and it is a
mighty difficult matter to enforce the
law. My idea is to keep the lid on
without quibbling with these fellows
as to what they sell.
"Anything that contains alcohol or
malt and is sold as a beverage, any
thing that looks like beer, foams like
beer, tastes like beer or acts like beer
is under the rule. That ought to be
clear. Now if anyone wants to sell
the stuff, that's his business. The
state's position is clear."

Sofia, Pept. 6. The Rumanian
towns of Kurtbunar and Akkadunlar
have been captured by the Bulgarian
and German forces who have pushed
forward ten miles into Rumanian ter
ritory in their invasion of the Io
brudja region, it was officially an
nounced today.
Kurtbunar and Akkadunlar lie al
most directly south of the Rumanian
city of Silistra and about sixty-five
j miles northwest of the Bulgarian port
of Varna.
48 Miles Into Hungary.
Paris, Sept. 5- The advance of the
Rumanian troops in the first five days
of their campaign was considerable
and at some points it was as much as
eighty kilometers (about forty-eight
miles) says a dispatch from Urgeni
under date of Saturday to the Petit
Parisien. The forward march, how
ever, now has been somewhat slack
ened because of the difficulty of send
ing supply conveyors. Altho the
ground on the eastern Hungarian
frontier was unfavorable for the Ru
manians, the correspondent said they
were successful in their dash across
the river and now occupy the valleys.
Rumania's declaration, the dispatch
adds, was so unexpected that only a
few troops of the dual monarchy were
on the Rumanian frontier, and these
were not on guard when hostilities
were begun.
IWHlaraUon Came Suddenly.
Half an hour before war was de
clared, Hungarian officer-: were drink
ing with Rumanian officers at a Ru
manian railroad station. Soon after,
an outpost entered the station and
took tb- officers prisoners and then
captured quantities of materials. The
Rumanian offensive was so sudden
that the Austrians had not time to
blow up bridges or tunnels.
Russians Iand to Aid Rumania.
Rome, Sept. 5. Russian transports
have landed a large Slav contingent at
the Rumanian port of Constanza to
aid in the operations against Bulgaria,
according to advices received here to
day. Part of the Russian forces al
ready have joined the Rumanians re
sisting the German-BuSgar attacks
along the Dobrudja frontier.
Rumanian vanguards have entered
the Transylvanian city of Herman
stadt, which was evacuated by the
Austrians several days ago.
A Rumanian Defeat.
London, Sept. 5. The first day's
fighting on Rumanian soil, due to the
Invasion of Dobrudja by Bulgarians
and Germans is said by the Bulgarian
.war office to have resulted in the re
treat of the Rumanians, who left hun
dreds of dead on the field. As pre
viously reported by the German war
office, the invaders crossed the entire
Dobrudja frontier and occupied towns
near the border.
The statement issued in Sofia says:
"On our northern front our armies
on Saturday crossed the entire Do
brudja frontier, energetically driving
back advanced detachments of the
enemy. We occupied Kurtburnar after
fighting in which we took prisoner
165 men and two officers. The enemy
retreated leaving on the field hun
dreds of dead as well as a great num
ber of rifles and a quantity of ma
terial. One of our columns occupied
Akkadunlan. The march forward Is
proceeding on the whole line.
"A hostile fleet bombarded the for
tifications north of Kavala, enemy
aeroplanes dropped bombs on the vil
lage of Starovo and Hazuatar and on
Anglsta station. Several inhabitants,
including women and children were
killed."

one of the foremost exponents of the
i modern dance on the American stage,
i who went abroad several months ago
j to join the colors under the British

France, according to reports received
here. For several days past there has
been a rumor along Broadway to the
effect that Castle had met his end in
the war, but it remained for a letter
received by Mips Mildred Francis, a

According to the letter from Sloden.

Washington. Sept. 6. To the pro

Washington, Sept. 5. One thou

election day is all that Miss Alice Paul
of the Congressional Union asks of
suffragists. A few days ago Mrs. O.

RATE CASE IS ON
Testimony in Passenger Hear
ing Before P. U. CV
Expense of Handling Traffic by
the Santa Fe.
Additional testimony in the passen
ger rate case is to be taken before the
public utilities commission this week.
Evidence as affecting the passenger
business of the Santa Fe and Missouri,
Kansas & Texas railroads, will be of
fered that the record before the com
mission may be clear. No indication
has come from the state commission
as to the time when it plans to decide
the rate controversy.
The passenger rate case which is
now before the commission is the
same action which was presented to
the commission twenty-two months
ago. The case has called scores of
high salaried railway officials to To
peka, has occupied the attention of the
commission and its attaches for weeks
and has come to naught so far as the
railroads and public are concerned.
A year ago it was rumored that Joseph
L. Br i stow and the commission would
save the decision in the case until
some time in the present campaign.
Now there is a rumor that the case
may not be decided this year.
Evidence affecting the expense of
handling passenger traffic in Kansas
will be presented by the Santa Fe and
Katy railroads. The testimony is sup
plemental to the heavy record made
by the two roads when the case was
before the commission in April, 1915.
The new testimony was ordered by the
commission and affects tests made by
the roads in Kansas during the last
few months.

BODY TO KANSAS
Echo , of , JVew 1l ork Tragedy
Beaches Fort Scott.
Police Mystified, Believe Slay
ers Were Blackmailers.
New Tork, Sept. S. Miss Mary Mc
Niff will re-enact today her part in the
tragedy of Sunday night when Dwight
Dilworth, her companion, wa shot
and killed supposedly by highwaymen
on "Lovers' Lane" in Van Cortland
purk. The audience . will . consist of
police officers and detectives an?ious
to learn the full details of the crime.
Baffled by the fact that Dil worth, was
not robbed, the police today believe
the murder to have been committed
by park blackmailers who have been
constantly preying upon young cou
ples spooning in the park. From
Kansas City came a message which
read:
"As he is gone I will not come home
but will wait for him here."
The message was from Dil worth's
wife and directed that the body be
phipped to Fort Scott, Kan., for I. u rial.
Miss McNiff, whose story -wa.a at
first conflicting and incoherent, has
regained her composure and today the
police expect her to reveal important
clues in her acting of the tragedy.
WILSON ELATED
Enthusiasm of Depot Crowds
Looks Good to President.
"Finest I Eyer Haye Received,"
He Tells Associates.
On Board the President's Special,
Huntington, W. Va., Sept. 6. "These
have been the finest receptions I have
ever received," President Wilson to
day characterized his trip thru West
Virginia and Kentucky.
The president was delighted at the
enthusiasm with which he was re
ceivedeven when, late at right, there
was nothing tor small town crowds to
cheer but the darkened private car.
The president's Journey into Ken
tucky, while characterized as non
pelitical. has proved, gratifying to his
political aides. At every point en
route crowds met him with bands and
cheers at stations. In many Instances
they waited until after midnight for
a view of the presidential train. Even
tho they did not see the president, they
cheered loudly enough to wake every
one on the train.
Thursday night the president leaves
for Atlantic City, where he will ad
dress the convention of the National
Woman's Suffrage association. Sat
urday he expects to motor to Long
Branch. Probably he will take up his
pre-election plans and headquarters
there immediately.

Kill cats or giTe them good homes.
In a biennial report filed with Gov
ernor Capper, W., C. Tegmeier, as state
fish and game warden, makes numer
ous suggestions and asks for a state
fishing license law. The funds would
be used to maintain the state fish
hatchery at Pratt. The $176,000 in
stitution has been supported by funds
from hunting licenses. Now the hunt
ers are peevish under statutory re
strictions and new money is needed to
support the state, institution.
Tegmeier's report asks for numer
ous changes in the state game laws.
It asks for a five-year extension of the
closed season on prairie chickens. The
closed season would be lifted in 1916
under the present laws. But the state
warden believes the state should make
further efforts to protect and propa
gate the game bird thru an extension
of the closed season.
For their protection Tegemeier
wants turtle doves placed on the list
of game birds. The late Prof. L. L.
Dyche tried that once in a speech be
fore the senate. But the senate re
fused to see turtle doves and game
birds in the same classification.
Asks Many Changes.
Numerous changes are asked at the
hands of the legislature as affecting
the shooting of game birds. Warden
Tegmeier wants the open season on
doves from September IS to November
15 with a daily limit of twenty birds to
the hunter. The open season on quail
should be from December 1 to 16. Teg
meier believes. Ho wants the limit
placed at ten birds a day for each
hunter. In the killing of ducks, Teg
meier would limit the shooting to
twenty a day for each hunter with a
limit of six wild geese a day. The
statutory provision limiting the num
ber of live decoys should be repealed,
the report demands.
Salaried deputy fish and game
wardens should be appointed in every
county in the 8tatejthereport urges.

FIGHT BLOOD UP
NashTllle Democrats . Greet
Hughes With Jeers.
But He Fought Back Until
They Cheered Him.
Louisville, Ky., Sept. 5. Candidate
Hughes camped on the trail of Presi
dent Wilson today, more refreshed and
stimulated by the heckling he received
at the hands of a hostile audience at
Nashville than at any time since his
trip started.
He stopped here long enough to ex
pound his Republicanism In a brief
rear platform speech in which he
again assailed the Democratic party's
record on the tariff, Mexico, the
trusts and the recent railroad strike
settlement and urged placing of a re
publican administration in power to
achieve governmental efficiency. The
nominee was a different person than
the man who a little over four weeks
ago started off on a transcontinental
campaign trip. Probably r.o public:
speaker, let alone a presidential can
didate ever underwent such an ex
perience as Hughes did at the Ryman
auditorium in Nashville last night. He
faced an audience that was "packed"
against him and distinctly unfavorable
to his views. The crowd started a Wil
son demonstration. They hissed and
hooted the G. O. P. nominee.
Handed Rack Some Hot Shot.
Hughes, fighting mad at the insult
which he considered had been given
Mrs. Hughes, who was present on the
platform with him, simply struck out
straight from the shoulder and ram
med home his bitter criticism of the
Democratic administration with a new
line of hot shot. He riddled the strike
settlement recently achieved by Presl- i
UC11L ' ' IIOUU IIU l.uu Lll c nil 1 1 n 1 Jl 1 111(11
of hearing cheers and applause from
the southerners for his fighting spirit
and his determination to fight it out.
Naturally the candidate was in a
good humor today and the stimulus
of the night's meeting still stood with
him. He was also enjoying a good
Joke which some of his party had
against him.
$25,000 Cheek Phoney.
Secretary Lawrence II. Green
opened the morning's mail today and
nearly fainted when he saw a check
on a St. Louis bank for $25,000. No
letter accompanied the 'contribution'"
and it looked mighty good to Green.
He took it back to the governor in a
hurry. Then when the two came to
look over the contribution they found
it was a counter check on u St, Louis
bank, made out to the order of Charles
Evans House and signed "Hughes, per
Secretary J. Lansing." On the back
the nut who made the contribution
had endorsed in a flowing hand the
signature, Eduard James Porter, Esq.

Senate Passes These as Riders

Washington. Sept. 5. Drastic
amendments to the revenue bill strik
ing at the allied black list and British
interferences with American mails,
were adopted today by the senate and
created consternation among the dip
lomatic representatives of the allies.
In allied quarters it was declared that
the enactment of the amendments into
law would constitute nothing less than
a non-intercourse act, preliminary to
a commercial warfare with possibili
ties of far-reaching consequences.
Until the retaliatory amendments
become law with the president's sig
nature, the allies technically have
nothing to protest about but there are
assurances that representations will
be made if the amendment stay in the
bill. Inasmuch as the government had
decided on a course of legislation to
meet the restraints on commerce
which diplomatic correspondence has
been unable to remove it is generally
expected the amendments will be put
thru. The administration leaders who
have intimate, connections with the
government's foreign policy made no
attempt to stay their adoption.
Senate Adopts Amendments.
Washington, Sept. 5. An amend
ment to the revenue bill, authorizing
the president during a war in which
the United States is not engaged, to
withhold clearance from all vessels
which discriminate against American
shippers; to withhold privileges from
ships of such nations as withhold priv
ileges accorded to other nations from
American ships, and to use the army
and navy if necessary to prevent de
parture of offending vessels from
United States ports, was adopted today
by the senate.
An amendment of Senator Fhelan
of California was adopted authorizing
the president by proclamation to de
ny the use of the malls; express, tele
graph, wireless or cable facilities to
citizens of nations which do not ac
cord to Americans all facilities of com
merce, "including the unhampered
traffic in the mails." This amend
ment, it was declared, was aimed par
ticularly at British interference with
American mails.
Widen Tariff Commission's Powers.
The Chamberlain, amendment pro
hibiting admission of halibut and
salmon into the United States except
when in bond from an American port,
also was adopted. The amendment is
directed against Canadian fisheries on
the Pacific and to urge development
of American fisheries there.
An amendment to the tariff com
mission section by Senator Gallinger,
was adopted broadening the commis
sion's powers so that it shall "observe
the effect of tariff laws of industry
and labor and also observe the effect
of economic alliances."
An amendment by Senator Sterling
directing the commission to Investi
gate particularly the cost of produc
tion here and abroad was rejected.
