the several candidates for governor

The " good fellowship of all was
especially noticeable and this was due
probably to the one fact more than
any other that so many were mem

MILLION STRONG, MAY ASSESS
EVERY MEMBER FOR RED GROSS
With" rne than 2,250,000 members
liable, the First Catholic Slovak Union
of the United States of America, which
is in convention here, is considering
assessing everyone in the organization
for the benefit of the Red Cross fund.
The suggestion, which was made to
day, met with some approval, and ac
tion will be taken tilts week.
A stir among the many members of
the union throughout the country
is expected to be caused by the action
of the delegates today: in transferring
the national, officers from Middletown,
Pa., to Cleveland, O.
The Fourteenth biennial conventioi
of the union began its week's session
at Sokal hall, Hallett street this morn
ing following a mass celebrated by its
chaplain. Rev. Andrew Pasco, of Free
land, Pa-, in the church of Sts. Cyril
and Methodius.
About 2 50. delegates attended ,who
were seated later in the convention
hall, which had been decorated inside
and out for the occasion. Delegates
were reported from every state in the
union. The meeting was called to or
der at 9 o'clock by President Joseph
Klesel of Scranton. .
President Klesel' s report read before
e, convention this afternoon makes
the
radical recommendations as well as
showing that the membership and
finances of the organization have in
creased to a remarkablo extent during
the last year.
The Slovak union was formed Sept
4, 1890, for the temporal and spiritual
welfare of all of its members and to
support sick and disabled members
and relatives.
The president's report shows that
the membership is now 67,000, or
more than one-quarter more than It
was last year. More than $37,004,000
of insurance, has been written by the
union, which has now passed its two
million and a quarter mark In mem
bership. , i
The report shows that since the last
convention recommendations towards
deeding Its orphanage In Pennsylania
to the Sisters of Mercy and the es
tablishment of a Franciscan . order
priest for the spiritual guidance of tha
90 orphans, has been accomplished.
It is recommended that the farm at
tached to the orphanage, now one of
the show "spots of Pennsylvania, be
placed under the direct charge of an
agricultural . college graduate that it
may be improved from an. economic
standpoint also' that a home for the
aged ant) crippled be established. '
OtherTecomraendations are thVco -
binlng of the officers of the recording
and -financial secretary under that of
the present secretary, the increased
salary of the president and removal
of the national offices.. ,
. Clubs for the women and children
as well as for the men under the
union is advocated after an exhaustive
study of social ' conditions . recently
made " by the president
'. It Is reported that the failure, of
the literacy act to pass congress' has
met with favor of all Slovaks in this
country who deem the requirements
proposed too severe upon many of the
race who Would make good ciizens if
admitted into the country. -
Reports of other officers were read
at today's session and will fee con
tinued tomorrow. The union is .re
ported to have established " 850
'branches lft America.
One committee was oppolnted to
day, that of grievances and charity.

covers Plenty of Traces
But Not His Spouse.
Judge G'JStave Eppelmann of Bea
con, N. ' Y., is in this city searching
for his wife. Twice he has been close
on her trail, but even time has been
confronted with the Information that
she had not appeared at institutions
to which she had been recommended.
Mrs. Eppelmann's son was a mem
ber of the crew of the U. S. cruiser
Memphis which was wrecked in the
storm off Santo Domingo city ,last
Wednesday and as he has not been
heard from in some time the father is
fearful lest he was one of crew in
jured Mr. Eppelmann today said that his
wife left her home in Beacon August

going to a city hospital. As she Is a
midwife, she could get work as a nurse
or doing general housework. The hus
band immediately began asearch and
found that his wife had gone to Hope
well Junction, N. Y., and from there
had taken a train to Danbury. From
the latter place she was traced to this
city as the conductors on the trains,
,to whom the husband described her,
remembered that she had been a pas

end vainly.
With the assistance of Detective

search anew. At the office of the
Free Employment bureau it was said
that Mra Eppelmann had applied for
work, but that as she preferred nurs
ing, was advised to apply at the

man, in charge of the latter office.sald
that she had not been at the registry.
Judge Eppelmann said that several
years ago his wife had left home for
a short while, but soon returned. It
is believed that she is slightly dement

scription of Mra Eppelmann: Five
feet six inches tall, 41 years old,
weighs 115 pounds and has white hair
slightly streaked with gray. She car
