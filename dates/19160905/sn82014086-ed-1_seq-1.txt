and Bulgaria Berlin Admits Loss of Airship.
Keeping- up their strong offensive
against the Germans north and south
of the Somme river in France, the
Anglo-French forces have again driven
their lines forward and captured im
portant Germttn positions.
South of the Somme the village of
Soyecourt and part of the village of
: Vermandovillers have been captured,
while, eeemtngly more important still,
the French have made fresh progress
east of the village of Forest, -which
lies one and one-half miles southeast
of tba railroad town of Comhles a
gain which, taken with the capture of
Uuiilemont on Sunday, seemingly out
ranks Combles and apparently renders
it untenable. More than 5,000 Ger
mans have been made prisoner north
and south of the Somme during the
past two days.
Fresh Coin Near Fleury.
On the British right wing progress
is reported north of Falfemont farm,
while a German counter-attack north
west of Moquet farm was repulsed. In
the Verdun sector Paris records a
fresh gain near Fleury. Berlin in ad
mitting the claims of British and
French successes in the fighting of
Sunday in the Somme region says tho
battling over the lS-mlie frcnt from
Utaumont to the S.'mme was of the
greatest ferocity. Tho Germans held
their ground at Thiepval, north of
Pozieres, and near Ginchy, but Gilie
mont village and wood were lost, as
likewise was Ginchy, but a counter
attack cf the Germans won back a
portion of the latter town.
Fighting in Galicia.
Again there is heavy fighting on the
front in Russia west ar.d southwest of
Lutsk and north of Zborow and near
Urezezany, in Galicia, with the Rus
sians generally the aggressors. Petro
grad controverts the assertion of Ber
lin that the Russians obtained only
local successes near Brezezany by the
declaration that the Russians won a
victory over the Teutons here and

Heavy Squall.
Vineyard jlaven, Mass., Sept. 4. A
heavy squall in Vineyard sound while

Meadow and ' Hedge Fench shoals and
to have picked up an oar such as
Thompson carried in the pilot skiff.
The oody sank before the searchers
could get alongside.

to Have Starter From Cigarette.
New London, Conn., Sept. 4. The
Pequot Casino, fronting on New Lon
don harbor, sustained fire damage to
the extent of about $25,00 about neon
today. The blaze started in the third

lessly dropped, according to the the
ory held by the management and the
fire damage was practically confined

COMMISSION COMES
TO NEW LONDON TODAY.
Secretary Lansing Tells Y oMusl
Be Considered in Set? United
States-Mexican Diffic'
New York, Sept. J" personal
rights and econo interests of
Americans In Mi riust be con
sidered in reach' permanent set
tlement of the cities between the
United State? - Mexico, Secretary
of State La, said here today in
an address at luncheon attended by
the members of the American-Mexican
Joint conT"i.sion.
Secretary Lansing declared that If
"suspicion, doubt and aloofness"
marked the ccming deliberations, the
commission might expect to accom
plish little and would leave the two
nations "in the same tangle of mis
understandings and false judgments
which I feel have been the chief rea
sons for our controversies In the past."
Luis Cabrera, chairman of the Mex
ican commission, in reply to Secre
tary Lansing, said that the result
which his commission seeks is the
same sought by the American dele
gates and that the mutual spirit of
harmony might be inferred from the
notes exchanged between the two gov
ernments. Secretary Lane announced that the
commissioners and their party would
sail on the presidential yacht May
flower at 9 a. m. tomorrow for New
London and that beginning fjn Wed
nesday two two-hour conferences
would be held each day. Luis Cabre
ra will preside at the first day's
meetings and Secretary Lane on
Thi;'!ay, the two to alternate on
subsequent days.
The secretary added that while the
proceedings would be confidential
some arrangement probably would be
made to give daily statements to the
press.
PAID HOMAGE TO
. MEMORY OF LINCOLN
President Wilson Accepted for Gov
ernment Log 'Cabin Where He was
Born.
Hodgenville, Ky., Sept. 4. President
Wilson came to Kentucky today to
pay homage to the memory cf Lincoln
and avoid politics, but a great crowd
from all parts of the state cheered
him at every appearance and turned
his visit into a campaign event. .
The president accepted for the fed
eral government the iog cabin in
v nich Lincoln was born, in a speech
devoted to an eulogy of the Civil war
president. Standing on a temporary
platform at the foot of a hill topped
by a magnificent granite memorial
building housing the Lincoln cabin,
he praised Lincoln as the embodiment
of democracy.
"We are not worthy to stand here
unless we ourselves be in deed nnd in
truth real democrats and servants of
mankind," he said, "ready to give our
very lives for the freedom and jus
tice and spiritual exaltation of the
great nation which shelters and nur
tures us."
Thu non-political character cf the
programme was emphasized by the
mention of the name of Charles B.
Hughes, the republican nominee, by
one of the speakers in giving the list
of directors of the Lincoln Farm Asso
ciation. But as soon as the formal exercises
Were over, politics came to the fore.
At the railroad station the president
stood for nearly an hour shaking
hands with men and women who
greeted him as "the next president."
As his train pulled out the crowd
cheered and clapped, while he bowed
in acknowledgment.
CALLED EIGHT HOUR
LAW A MAKESHIFT.
Lively Tilt in House Over Bill Which
is Called Only Part of Legislative
Programme.
Washington, Sept. 4. There was a
lively tilt in the house today over the
eight hour day law enacted last week
to prevent the threatened railroad
strike. Representative Moore of Penn
sylvania, republican, criticised the
president and congress, insisting that
the law was a makeshift, likely to
bring on a strike later when it would
be a greater calamity. Representative
Adamson, author of the act, denied all
of Mr. Moore's assertions nad declared
that the law was only a part of a leg
islative programme to be completed at
another session.
OFFICIAL ANALYSIS BY FOOD
SURROGATES IN BELGIUM.
"Oil Sauce" Sold for Food Found to
Contain 99.25 Per Cent. Water.
Amsterdam, Netherlands, Sept. 4.
Official analysis of some of the food
surrogates in Belgium is disclosing
some extraordinary frauds. The di-
t-Qtrt. crein iy i 1 rf Vi mihlin HoltV,
i se-rvice has found that some of The
substitutes for oil, which is no longer
obtainable, are worthless concoctions
that cost the manufacturers only a few
cents per liter but which are sold to a
gullible public at fancy prices. One
"oil sauce" was found to be 99.25 per
cent, water, with the remaining 75-100
per cent, an extract of gum. A "may
onnaise" In fancy packing and "highly
recommended" was found to contain
86 per cent, water, 1.30 per cent, oil,
10.70 per cent, starch and- 2 per cent,
ash. An Invalid's food advertised as
"meat extract, extra- quality," was
made of 65 per cent, water, 115 per cent,
burnt sugar and 25 per cent. salt.
"Butter" that sold at 1.20 per kilo
gram was made of tallow, cotton oil
and borax. Jam brewed out ol sea
weed: plaster of paris that passed for
rye Hour; coffee that was made of
senna seeds: cigars that were rolled
in a fine chestnut tree leaf with the
filling of various dried leaves, and such
frauds were found also.

Declares For Principle of Fair Impar

tion by Any Power on Earth First
Republican Candidate in Tennessee.
Nashville. Tenn., Sept. 4. In terri
tory which no republican presiden
tial nominee ever has visited before,
Charles E. Hughes tonight faced a
tumultous audience In the auditorium
here. With eh
. w UWUi. U W VV 11-
son ringing again and again In his
j u y questioners and halt
ed often by domocraMc sympathizers,
the nominee criticised the adminis
tration for it policies, argued for a
protective tariff and In reference
which the n.ulience took to applv,
to the enactment of the Adamson bill
asserted that he stood firmly for the
arbitration of all industrial disputes.
Can Be Settled by Facts."
"I believe there Is no grievance with
respect to labor," Mr. Hughes said,
that cannot be settled bv a fair, can
did explanation of the facts
"We have, in the past, had to deal
frequently with the opposition of em
ployers to the vincipal of arbitration.
Sometimes they have refused to ar
bitrate disputes. Public opinion has
been against them. I stand firm
ly for the principle of arbitrating in
dustrial disputes and I would not
surrender it to anybody in the coun
try. "I believe that anything that Is
right in this country can be settled
right. What is our republican gov
ernment? What are our free institu
tions? We have come down the long
course of history with the people
fighting slowly, slowly now with a
defeat and now with victory for a
recognition of the reign of reason in
stead of the reign of tyranny and force
Stands For Two Things.
"Now then, I stand for two things:
First for the principle of fair, impar
tial, thorough, randid arbitration and,
second, for legislation on facts accord
ing to necessities of the case. And
I am opposed to being dictated to
either in the executive department or
congress by any power on earth be
fore the facts are known. -
"We have a' great country and a
great future. But it can only be pre
served in one way: That wrs- is the
way of all honest, fair investigation
and candid treatment. Show me
the way that is right and I will take
It; but I won't take any way that
I do not know anything about."
Applauded His Statement.
The audience, which had Interrupt
ed 'Mr. Hughes repeatedly In the early
portions of his speech to cheer for
Wilson, heard the nominee's declara
tion fn silence and at its conclusion
applauded him.
Tonight's address, the second of the
day, was delivered before a crowded
house. The crowd came early and
remained to hear all the nominee had
to say. But before he started it
plainly that many Wilson supporters
were present.
J. Will Taylor, republican state
chairman, the first speaker, was in
terrupted by cheers for Wilson. Amid
a burst of Wilson cheers he sat down
and George N. Tillman, chirman of
the meeting, stood up. Mr. Taylor
was on his feet for ten minutes,
much of the time vainly endeavoring
to make himself heard. He intro
duced Mr. Hughes and the audience
waited in silence.
"Warmth of Welcome."
"I shall not forget the warmth of
the welcome of this vociferous meet
ing," Mr. Hughes said, smiling, and
the audience applauded. He added
that what he had to say was to be
"good naturedly' at a time that the
American people were taking stock.
Then he outlined his views on Amer
ican industry, the test it will face
when the war ends, and the doctrine
of a protective tariff. He was in
terrupted frequently by applause
and now and then by cheers for Wil
son. More applause greeted his
reference to labor legislation enacted
during his terms as governor of New
York.
Protective Tariff.
"Now our opponents do not believe
in the doctrine of a protective tariff,"
he added, producing a memorandum
from his pocket. He checked a Wil
son cheer by adding: "I am not go
ing to say anything unpleasant, my
friends. I am just going to read the
democratic platform."
He read the tariff plank of the plat
form of 1912.
"I believe." he continued, "i ' pro
tecting -American industry."
"And the man who can do it is
Woodrow Wilson," shouted a man
from the balcony. A wave of hand
clapping checked the nominee.
"There would not be much dispo
sition to clap,'' Mr. Hughes said,
smiling, as the applause died down,
"in this country if that doctrine got
headway very long."
Mr. Hughes declared that "nobody
would put over anything for private
gain at the public expense, in tariff, if
he could help it and was given pro
longed applause. The nominee then
assailed the administration for Its pol
icy toward Mexico. He outlined Its
attitude toward Huerta, declaring that
the question was not one of recogni
tion or non-recognition but of protect
ing American rirrhts.
"You would have recognized that
assassin." shouted a mrm from the au
dience, "Wouldn't you?"
"Now I riidn't fiv that " Mr.
Hughes started to reply. The rest of
his answer w.s lost in the tumult
which followed.
Would Have Protected American
Rights.
"What would you have done?'
shouted another man as the noise sub.
sided.
"I would have protected American
rights," the nominee- Bhouted quickly,
pointing his finger at the questioner.
The audience rose and applauded
loudly.
It was the last of the heckling, al
though there were two or three more
outbursts of cheering for Wilson.

Secret Demands
Made on China
FEAR THAT ANOTHER CRISIS
WITH JAPAN WILL DEVELOP
PEKING IS ALARMED
Acceptance of New Cabinet Hastened
by Seriousness of Problems Dis
missal of Chinese Officers, With
drawal of Garrison, Indemnification
and Extension of Rights Sought.
Washington, Sept. 4. Secret de
mands, in addition to those published
today In despatches from Peking, are
being pressed on China by Japan as a
result of the recent clash of Chinese
and Japanese troops at Cheng Chlatun.
It became known here tonight that the
situation is much more serious than
has been indicated, confidential reports
saying tho unpublished demands
threaten the authority of China over
the whole of inner Mongolia,
Anxiety Among Officials.
Officials here view the development
with real anxiety, fearing another
Chino-Japanese crisis which might In
volve the interests of the ynited States.
The Cheng Chiatun incident, trivial In
itself, but coming on top of the strain
ed relations ever since Japan took
over Kiachow from Germany, has been
closely watched since Japan hastened
to send 2,000 soldiers to the disturbed
district and her cabinet announced
that a satisfactory outcome depended
on China. Reports from Peking show
alarm there. The prompt and unani
mous acceptance of the new cabinet
announced today is believed to have
been a result of the seriousness of the
Japanese and financial problems.
Japan's demands as published call
for dismissal of Chinese officers in
command of the troops at the scene of
the trouble, withdrawal of the Chinese
garrisan, indemnification of the fami
lies of .'the Japanese killed and exten
sion of Japanese police rights to in
ner Mongolia.
The SeCret Demands.
The secret demands are believed to
seek extension to inner Mongolia of
rights which already have been won
in South Manchuria. In bofh places
China is forbidden under the treaty of
May S, 191a, to raise a foreign loan on
local taxes without Japan's consent,
and forced to consult Japanese in case
she cannot raise money herself for the
railroads there. " Beyond that, however,
the Japanese in South Manchuria have
unlimited rights of travel, residence,
trade and leasing of land, together with
the right of trial before a Japanese
consul in civil and criminal cases
Where a Japanese is defendant, the
right of opening and operating specified
mines and preference in case foreign
advisors are sought m military, polit
ical, police or financial mattere.
No Infringement on American Rights
None of the demands as published
infringes upon any right of the United
States, officials think, but a report on
the secret negotiations will be awaited
with concern, as they may conflict
with the open door policy and the in
tegrity of China. Except for the possi
bility of American interference, it is
pointed out, Japan practically has a
free hand in China, as all the Euro
pean powers are too fully occupied at
home to devote much attention to the
far east.
Another Clash Between Japs
and
Chinese.
Tokio, Sept. 5, 10.15 a. m. Another
clash between Chinese and Japanese
troops is officially reported from Chao
Yangpo, Mongolia, and has led to the
despatch of heavy Japanese reinforce
ments. It is claimed that the Chinese
attacked the Jnpanese while the Jap
anese were advancing to mediate be
tween Chinese and Mongolians.
MANY INJURED WHEN
GRANDSTAND COLLAPSED
Bleacher Seats Gave Way at Fight
Half of Those Involved Seriously
H urt.
Colorado Springs, Colo, Sept. 4.
The collapse of a portion of tho
bleacher seats at the White-Welsh
lightweight championship fight today
precipitated 200 spectators to the
ground and injured at least one hun
dred, several seriously. At "various
hospitals here tonight It was stated
that all of the sixty persons taken
there after the accident would re
cover. Many were released after hav
ing their injuries dressed.
The crash came before the larger
part of the crowd had arrived. Poilce
men aided by the fire department
quickly placed the injured in automo
biles and comparatively little confu
sion resulted and the boxing program
was not delayed.
Announcement was made from the
ringside that the stands nad been
carefully inspected before the crowd
was admitted, but D. G. Johnson, the
commissioner of public safety, said
that so far as he knew no inspection
had been made by the city engineer's
office. He added that a thorough In
vestigation would be made in an ef
fort to fix the responsibility.
American Industrial Commission.
Bordeaux, Sept. 4. The American
Industrial commission to France ar
rived last night cn board the steam

committee composed of representa
tives of the municipality and the Bor
deaux chamber of commerce.
devoted to a discussion of efficiency
of government.
The nominee's address tonight end
ed his political activities of the day.
He entered Nashville this morning to
find a programme different from the
one he thought he would face In that
it provided for a review of the Ten
nessee National Guard and an address
at a Labor Day celebration. The
first he declined on the grouwi that
ho had no right to review federalized
state troops. The proposal that he
attend the Labor Day celebration was
dismissed when he was advised that
labor leaders arranging it had not
sent him a formal invitation and that
If he spoke he would be restricted to
a topic of a non-political nature.
Mr. Hughes left late tonight for
Lexington, Ky., where he will speak
tomorrow. - - - .. .

Big Attendance
at County Fair
BUSY OPENING DAY FOR OFFI
CIALS AND UNION WORKERS
10,000 ON GROUNDS
Exhibits of Unusual Number and
Merit Much Activity Along the
Midway Good Racing and Pleasing
Vaudeville Fireworks a Feature of
the Night Programme.
By the most rigid quarantine orders
from the seat of highest authority
the busy, bustling office of genial Sec
retary William W. Beckwith every
thought of infantile and all other
sorts of paralysis were strictly exclud
ed from the grounds of the ISTew Lon
don County Agricultural society on
Monday. And so the county fair
meant everything it ought to mean a
big, happy, carefree, informal, sociable
gathering, a place, where old friends
meet and new ones are made; where
you stop in wonderment before your
neighbor's big squashes and you ren
der hirn speechelss with those yearling
steers of yours; where you wander
through the midway and munch pop
corn and look at the girls and listen to
"eats 'em alive" and "sure to witi:"
Where you wake up and urge and cheer
when the horses race up the stretch
neck and neck "and you stop breathing
while the young chap in the blue tights
is whirling around in mid-air and you
hardly dare to look when tho man
cuts away from the balloon and drops
like a bullet. Eventually you go home
as grimy as a day of dust can make
you, as thirsty as a camel, as well
satisfied with yourself and youi
neighbors as only a day as well spent
can make you. For all these things,
and a lot more besides, make up a
real county fair, and that was the kind
that happened yesterday.
Ten thousand people, and a trifle
over that, ' were at the day fair, the
best kind of cool and breezy and
snappy weather co-operating with La
bor day and a lot of hard work and
good advertising to bring about a sa1
isf ictory and a satisfied crowd. The
night fair, with its stage attractions,
and the band, and a mighty fine set of
fireworks, and a bright and gleaming
midway, and a crescent moon,' and
grandstand tickets only 10 cents, and
other things, too, brought out perhaps
3,000 people in the evening. Altogether
it was a busy day for the fair officials,
the Labor union workers, the many
people who were exhibiting, the trol
leymen, the jitney drivers (who ask a
quarter) and the suffragists. There
were other people who - worked lhard
that needn't be mentioned.
One of the things that struck the
casual observer at first glance was the
quantity and quality of livestock on
tho grounds this year. The splendid
animal from the Connecticut Agricul
tural college, marvels resulting from
eugenics applied to horses and cattle
the way it ought to be to men, were
centers of attention and praise. The
Branford Farms stock, on the other
side of the exhibition hall, was an
other lot of the finest breeding and the
sterling products of such well known
cattle breeders as James B. Palmer of
Lisbon, Charles I. Briggs of Lebanon
and John D. Avery of North Stoning
ton, and many others, excited admira
tion from all beholders.
The other exhibits, too. in nil de
partments were in keeping with the
standards set through 62 years of
prosperity and (progress bv' this for
ward looking agricultural society.
Along the Midway.
A trip along: the Midway, starting:
from the Boy Scouts' tent and first
aid tents and The Bulletin's Social
Corner tent through the lane to the
poultry building, was of course one of
the essentials. The machinery tents
of T. H. Eldredge and the C. S. Mer
sick company were humming and
chugging away all day long, and in
the grange building A. D. Zabriskie's
familiar face was back and he and his
corps of helpers were serving their
usual fine dinners. The Brook's tur
key dinner tent on the other side of
the Midway was something new this
year, but liberally patronized. Wheels
of fortune and games of chance, all
of the innocuous variety, flourished,
with Thermos bottles, and blankets
and Teddy bears and other valuable
articles as goals of achievement. Wild
Rena competed with Amgoza in the
fierce growlmgs that emanated from
their respective dens, both having
very, very recently been brought from
the darkest part of Africa, or Volun
town, or somewhere. A motordrome
is a new attraction and so is Luken's
big animal tents, but Joseph A. George
and Burlingham s quick lunch, and
the doll-babies and the dodgers are
just as they used to be in days of
yore, and just so, it is our duty and
our privilege to state, is the little
tent flying the colors of purple, green
and white.
Not quite as of old, for the Cause
spelled with a capital is growing and
there are new faces and the quantity
of enthusiasm inevereth, without loss
of quality. For instance, a new lead
er gained during the year is Miss
Daphne Selden of Deep River and af
ter helping the Norwich chairman,
Mrs. J. Eldred Brown, Miss Mary
Richards and Miss Gladys FLsko,

First 'Aid by Boy Scouts.
After suffrage, very little Is left to
write about, except that the Boy
Scouts are on first aid service, some
at their red cross tent, others by
turns around,, the grounds. They had
