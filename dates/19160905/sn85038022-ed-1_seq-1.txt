WONDERFUL CONCERT
Waa the One Given In JUwhwood
Park Last Evening by Alice Nfel
en, the Kamona Soprano
Many Attend.
The Alice Nielsen Concert at Beech
wook Park laat evening waa pro
nounced by thoae attending to have
been the most wonderful concert ever
heard in the City of Maysville. Miss
Nielsen, assisted by Mr. Karl Kirk
Smith, violin cello, and Mr. William
Roddick, pianist, appeared before an
audience representative of Kentucky
culture and presented a concert pro
gram which received every evidence
of Intelligent appreciation.
From the first number to the last,
Miss Nielsen and her audience were
In complete accord, the close atten
tion and manifest pleasure of the lat
ter moving the former to her best ef
forts, and to liberal response to the
demands made upon the encore part
of her repertory. As sweet and acqui
escent personally as ahe was delight
ful and compelling in the charm of her
artistic accomplishments. Miss Niel
sen won her audience as completely
as any singer that ever appeared In .1
concert role In Maysville.
The program, for the most part sim
ple and no wide range of variation,
was so constructed, nevertheless, as to
demonstrate conclusively that Mis
Nielaen can sing arias and the heavy
operatic airs with the same ease and
facility which attend her rendition of
the lighter ballads. The singer, per
haps, waa more clearly In her element
or at least it appeared that she was in
more thorough conjunction with the
majority of her audience, when she
sang the simple sentimental ballads,
which comprise more than half the
numbers of her program. In these
songs she puts her heart and In them
ehe reaches directly the hearts of her
hearers and therein Is she a great
singer.
Her encores were happily chosen
and the pearls that fell from her lips
in such songs as "Believe Me If AH
Those Endearing Young Charms" an!
"My Old Kentucky Home" were re
flected In the happy tears that flowed
from the eyes of eome of the good old
fashioned people who know how to
cling to the best and are not ashamed
of It. I'nspoiled by triumph, unaffect
ed. Miss Nlejsen was prodigal with
her bows and graciously liberal In re
sponding to the insistent demands for
encore numbers. Her voice Ib rich
and liquid in quality, and remarkeble
for the ease and clarity with which
she takes her registers, and equally
remarkable for the unusual fucllltv
which marks the transition from the
high full tones to the ineffably soft
and sweet notes with which she en
wraps the final words of many pas
sages encountered in her songs.
Rut there was another element con
ductive to the complete success of
this entertainment. Mr. Karl Kirk
Smith, vlolonchelllst, waa received
with unstinted favor. Mr. William
Ileddlck, accompanist, at all times
seemed to be very sensitive to the so
loist's moods and his accompaniment
throughout was marked by accuracy
and intelligent sympathy.
