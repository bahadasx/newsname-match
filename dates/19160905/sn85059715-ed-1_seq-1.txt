WASHINGTON. Sept. 5?Drastic
amendments to the revenue bill,
striking at the Allied "black list" and
British Interference with American
malls, were adopted Tuesday by the
Senate and created consternation
among the diplomatic representatives
of the Allies.
In Allied quarters It was declared
that the enactment of the amend
ments Into law wtfuld constitute
nothing less than a non-Intercourse
act preliminary to a commercial war
far* with possibilities ot tor-reaching
consequences.
Until the retaliatory amendments
become law with the president's sig
nature the Allies technically have
nothing to protest about, but there
are assurances that representations
will be made If the amendments Btay
In the bill.
Inasmuch as the government has
decided on a course of legislation to
meet the restraints upon commerce,
which diplomatic correspondence has
been unable to remove, it Is generally
expected the amendments will be put
through.

will be furnished by Gregory's First
regiment band. '}'!??
immediately following the reception,
the committee meeting will be held
