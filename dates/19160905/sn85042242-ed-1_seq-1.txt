Russians and Says They

Lojadon, Sept. 4.—Keeping up a
strong offensive against the -Germans
in Somme and northern France, the
Anglo-French forces have driven their
lines formard.
South of the Somme the village of
iSoycerat and part of the village of
Vermandovillers have been captured,
while seemingly more important still,
the French have made important
progress east of the village of For­
rest, which lies 1 1-2 miles east of
Kombels a gain which takes with it
the capture of Guillemont on Sunday,
seemingly outflanks Kombels and ap­
parently renders it untenable. More
than 5,000 Germans have .been made
prisoners north and south ol' the
Somme.
On the iBritish right wing progress
is reported north of Thiaumont farm,
while a German counter attack north­
east of Moquet farm was repulsed.
In the Verdun sector Paris records
fresh gains near Fleury. Berlin, in ad­
mitting the claims or the iBritish in
the Somme region, says the battling
over the 18-mile front from Beaumont
to Somme was of the gravest.
Germans Hold Ground.
The Germans held their ground at
Thielpval, north of Pozieres and near
Ginchy, but Guillemont village and
'wood were lost, as likewise was Gin
chy, but a counter attack of the Ger­
mans won back a portion of the lat­
ter town.
Again there is heavy fighting on the
front in {Russia, west and southwest
of Lutsk and north of ZtioroW ana
near Brezezzany, in Galicia, with the
Russians generally the aggressors.
Petrograd controverts the assertion
of Berlin that' the Russians attained
local successes near (Brezezany toy a
declaration that the Russians won a
victory and took 2,641 prisoners. In
the Carpathian region, according to
Petrograd, the Russians have captur­
ed an entire series of heights and are
advanced to the Hungarian frontier.
Roumanians Pressing Forward.
All along the Transylvania front,
the Roumanians continue to press
their advantage against the Austro
Hungarians. Here they have captur­
ed additional towns and are said to
be bombarding the town of Hermann
stadt, which is second in importance
only to Kronstadt. The Germans and
Bulgarian forces are attacking along
the entire front between Kronbeja
and iBulgaria. Near Koemar, Berlin
reports the Roumanians were driven
back with the loss of 700 men taken
prisoners.
In Albania the Italians east of Av
alona have taken the villages of Ku
ai and Brazar and Monte Gradist.
The Germans have surrendered to the
E'ritish Dar Es Salaam, Germany's
hiefc seaport in East Africa.
Considerable fighting is in progress
in the Austro-ltalian theatre but with­
out any important changes having oc­
curred.
Berlin admits the loss of an air­
ship the, night of September 2. It is
probable that this was the Zeppelin
which London reported was brought
down during the raid on the coast of
Endland Saturday night.

By EWING LEWIS.
iMercedes, Texas, Sept. 4.—With
Lieut. Col. Grafton and Captain Boyd
of Hillsboro, Captain Welch visited
Brownsville, the first of the week.
Captain Welsh renewed acquaintance­
ship with a number of officers. *rith
whom he had served in thd. Philip­
pines. The North Dakota officers
stood on the bank of the Rio Grande
and took a good look at the country
whose behavior called them down to
the border. No soldiers are allowed
to make visiting trips to iMatamoras,
across the river. Civilians from
Brownsville now go over to Matamo
ras at will, and a number feel no hes­
itation in making trips to 'Monterey.
The North Dakota officers returned at
the end of the day.
Another big dinner was served at
camp last Sunday, Uncle Sam's ra­
tions being augmented with things
bought with the donated mess fund.
The army cook instructor, who is vis­
iting neighboring camps, will find few
things to teach the stove battery of
Bismarck company. It is the general
impression among the good feeders of
Co. A that the instructor may learn
a thing or two himself while he is
with them.
Instructor Goes to Kitchens.
This instructor, William R. Jeffries
of the 26th Infantry, does not call
his pupils to his own kitchen and
show them how he does it, in the,
manner of cooking instructors at a
chautauqua. He walks unannounced
into a company kitchen, watches how
things are being done, and then takes
charge and shows the cooks how the
regular army does them. He is a
wonderful cook and in his hands mac­
aroni ceases to be just macaroni, and
becomes something that you would
walk ten blocks for at home his
army beans are as delicious as any
baked beans served at the table oj a
Boston millionaire and his pastries
taste like home, sweet home. He
has greatly improved the cooking in
the average state guard mess shed.
He is scheduled to visit Bismarck
company within ten days.
In a few days, in St. Peter, Minn.,
Private Hildreth Johnson will be laid
to rest. I wish that the people to
whom he is dear in St. Peter might
have stood at the railroad station in
Mercedes, as did nearly a hundred

his form was lifted into the car, and

Fargo, N. D„ Sept. 4.—William H.
White, Red River pioneer died here
tonight. He came to Fargo in 1872
and has resided here since.
A native of Vermont, Mr. White
came west in 1870, and for two years
made his home at Brainard, Minn. He
then moved to Fargo, where he en­
gaged. in the lumber business. The
"White Lumber company, of which he
has been president for the past 18
years, operates 16 lumber yards in

Ford Strikes Madison in Which
Mr. and Mrs. Hellstrom
Were Riding
MORRIS THROWN TWENTY
FEET THROUGH SHIELD
He and Swanson, Other Occupant
of Car, Charged with In­
toxication
Tom Morris was injured and three
other persons narrowly escaped death
last night, when two automobiles col­
lided on ©roadway and Fifth.
Mr. and Mrs. F. O. Hellstrom were
riding in one of the cars. They were
not hurt. Albert Swanson and Tom
Morris were in the other car. Mor­
ris was thrown through the wind­
shield from 20 to 80 feet. He was
able to get up and walk, however,
although he was cut 'by the glass and
badly bruised when he landed on the
sidewalk.
Place Both Under Arrest.
Both Swanson and Morris were
placed under arrest, charged with
running a car while intoxicated. Wit­
nesses declare that their machine was
going 40 miles or more an hour, while
the Hellstrom automobile was going
about 10. Judge Dolan declared last
night that Chief Downing and he had,
because of complaints received dur­
ing the afternoon, attempted to locate
the pair, but without success.
'Mr. Hellstrom was driving down
Fifth street, while the Ford was go­
ing west on Broadway. He saw the
lights coming up the street, but they
were so far away that he thought he
had plenty of time to pass. The first
thing he knew, however, the car was
upon him. He set the brakes and
turned to the right.
Strikes Hub of Wheel.
The other car shot across Fifth and
struck the hub of the front wheel of
the flellstrom. machine just as it
crossed the cross walk on Fifth street,
the/impact turning the machine half
way around and sending the Ford into
the telephone pole directly in front
of iHoman's Bakery.
Except the front wheel struck, Mr.
Hellstrom's automobile was not dam­
aged. If it had been a lighter ma­
chine, it would probably have turned
over and, spectators declare, if it
had been hit in the center by the
speeding machine serious injury
would have followed.
Mrs. W. E. Lahr and baby were in
a car only a few feet from the tele­
phone pole hit by the Ford.
Hellstrom Arrests Two.
Mr. Hellstrom got out of his car
and arrested Swanson, Morris having
left. A man came up, said he was
an officer and offered to take Swan­
son into custody. Mr. Hellstrom ask­
ed him to show his star. He couldn't.
Mr. Hellstrom invited him to go to
the police station with him and Swan­
son, proceeding up the street with
both of them. He met A. F. McDon­
ald, former chief of police, and turn­
ed the men over to him.
At the police station the man was
charged with impersonating an officer
of the law and placed in jail. He
gave his name as W. R. Carley.
Chris Martineson, night captain,
soon placed iMorris under arrest.

Heavy Japanese Reinforcements
Being Sent to the Scene

SITUATION REPORTED TO
BE VERY SERIOUS
Outcome of Difficulties Is Still
Unknown Crisis Will Soon
Be Reached
Tokio, Sept. 5.—Another clash be­
tween Chinese and Japanese troops
is officially reported from Choaynga,
Mongolia, and has l$d to the dispatch
of heavy Japanese reinforcements. It
is claimed the Chinese attacked the_
Japanese while the latter were ad-'
vancing to mediate between the Chi­
nese and Mongolians.
Situation Is Serious.
Washington, Sept. 4.—Secret de­
mands, in addition to those published
today in dispatches from Pekin, are
being pressed on China by Japan, as
a result of the recent clash of Chinese
and Japanese troops at Cheng Chia
tun. It became known here tonight
that the situation is much more seri­

STRIKE RIOT
AT El
Rioters Arrested After Doing
Great Damage to Business and
Other Places
El Paso, Sept. 4.—Rioting, an out­
growth of the strike of street car
trainmen in progress h«ro, followed a
Labor Day-parade ftjtt today. Rioters
attacked in down toton streets, wreck­
ed the cars, and retreated. Several
rioters were arrested.
The authorities expressed the be­
lief tonight that the situation was un­
der control.
Ill feeling between strikers and op­
erators, who took their place when
strike was called two months ago,
manifested on several occasions, re­
cently reached a climax,, through a
fist fight in a down town street be­
tween a striker and an employe of
the street car company. General dis­
turbance followed.
For a time it seemed that the muni­
cipal police, reinforced by a detach­
ment of Texas rangers, would be pow­
erless to handle the mob. Finally, af­
ter several hours of rioting on most
all business streets, and after street
car service had been suspended, the
mob was dispersed. The police were
ordered to shoot anyone interfering
with the cars.
IE
OF SEED HI
It is evident that there will be a
serious shortage of seed wheat suit­
able for raising the general crop for
1917. There are portions of the state
in which the grain is puite uniformly
too light to be relied upon to give a
sturdy growth. The danger of sow­
ing such light weight seed is large,
as any extraordinary weather condi­
tions might result in much crop fail­
ure.
The North Dakota pure seed law
authorizes the state seed commission­
er to list all persons who possess
seed suitable for sowing purposes.
The seed laboratory has very limit­
ed funds, but we can do a very large
amount of work if it is distributed
over the year. Names are placed
on the list as soon as we can test
or inspect the samples of sed to be
offered for sale. Those who have
grain that they wish tested should
send to the Pure Seed Laboratory
about a half pound sample, that we
may examine it as to its purity and
viability. The owner will receive a
correct report as to its seel value,
with such recommendations as we are
able to make.
Send in your samples at the earli­
est opportunity.
Present conditions are urgent.
Those who have good seed, particu­
larly in western and northwestern
portions of the state, will not only
be of aid to themselves, but will btf
of benefit to the public if they 'vill
make use of the laboratory in the
way indicated. The information that
should come with the sample can be
made out as follows: Name of own­
er, railroad station, kind of grain,
variety, bushels, cleaning machir.ery
available, storage and how lor.g grain
will be held.
Those' who wish to buy seed grain
should send in the following informa­
tion: 'Name, address, railroad sta­
tion. kind an dvariety of seed grain

Wilson Accepts for the

Speech Devoted to Eu logy on Beloved'' Abe''
Hodgensville, Ky„ Sept. 4.—Presi­
dent Wilson came to Kentucky today
today to pay homage to the memory
of Lincoln and avoid politics, but a
great crowd gathered from all parts
of the state cheered him at every turn
and turned his visit into a campaign
event.
The president accepted for the gov­
ernment the log cabin in which Lin­
coln was born. A speech was devoted
to the eulogy to the former United
States president. He praised Lincoln
as the embodiment of democracy.
IS
Republican Nominee Faces Tum­
ultous Audience at Nash*
ville, Tenn.
Nashville, Tenn., Sept. 4.—In terri
tory which no Republican presidential
nominee has ever visited before,
Charles E. Hughes faced a tumultuous
audience in the auditorium here to­
night.
With cheers for Woodrow Wilson
ringing again and again in his ears,
heckled by listeners and halted often
by Democratic sympathizers, the nom­
inee criticised the administration for
its policies, argued for a protective
tariff and, in references which the
audience took to apply to the enact­
ment of the Adamson bill, asserted he
stood firmly for arbitration of all in­
dustrial disputes.
"I believe there is no grievance
with respect to labor that cannot be
settled by a fair-handed explanation of
the facts," said Mr. Hughes.
"We have had in the past to deal
frequently with the opposition of em­
ployers to the principle of arbitration.
Sometimes they have refused to arbi­
trate disputes. Public opinion has
been against them. I stand here firm
ly for the principle of arbitrating in­
dustrial disputes and I would not sur
render it to anybody in the country.
I believe that anything that is right
in this country can be settled right.
What is our Republican government?
What are our free institutions? We
have come down the long course of
history with the people fighting, slow­
ly, slowly—now with defeat and now
with Victory—for a recognition of the
right of reason instead of the reign
of tyranny and force.
"Now, then, I stand for two things:
"First, for the principle of fair, im­
partial, thorough, candid, arbitration
and,
'Second, for legislation of facts, ac­
cording to the necessities of the case.
And I am opposed to be dictated to,
either in the executive position or
congress, by any power on earth be­
fore the facts are known. We have
a great country and great future. It
can only be preserved in one way.
That way is a fair, and thorough, and
candid investigation. Show me the
way-which is right, and I will take it.
But I won't take any way that I don't
know anythng about."
The audience which had interrupt
ed Mr. Hughes in cheering for Wilson
at the conclusion applauded him.
WELSH GETS DECISION
Colorado Springs, Colo., Sept. 4.—
Freddie Welsh retained his title of
champion lightweight pugilist of the
world today, after going the full
schedule of 20 rounds with Charlie
White of Chicago. Referee Billy
Roach of New York awarded Welsh
the decision on points. As the gong
sounded at the close of the 20 rounds
Roach stood for several moments as
if undecided. He then reached both
hands toward the boxers and many
spectators believed he was about to
declare a draw.
When Roach announced his deci­
sion in favor of Welsh the challeng­
er's adherers appeared spellbound for
a moment. Then began a fusilade of
hundreds of jeers at the referee. He
said he awarded the decision because
Welsh did most of the leading.
Bleacher Seats Collapse.
The collapse of a portion of the
bleacher seats at the Welsh cham­
pionship fight today precipitated 200
spectators on the ground and injured
at least 100 more probably seriously.
At various hospitals tonight it was
stated that the 60 persons taken there
after the accident would recover.
Many were released after being dress­
ed for their wounds. Police, aided by
members of the fire department and
special officers, quickly placed the in­
jured in automobiles and little confu­
sion resulted.
Announcement had been made at
the ringside that the stand had been
examined before the crowd was ad­
mitted and no person could place the
responsibility for the accident.
"How eloquent this little house
within this shrine is of the vigor of
democracy" exclaimed the president
as he spoke of Lincoln as exemplify­
ing the American spirit as showing
the heights which men of lowly birth
may attain.
"We are not worthy to stand here"
said he, "unless we ourselves be in
deed and in truth real democrats and
servants of mankind, ready to give
our very lives for the freedom and
justice and spiritual exaltation of the
great nation which shelters and nur­
tures us."
SCHOOLS OPEN FOR

Teachers and Students Ready
For Resumption of Work for
Coming Months
The Bismarck schools re-opened
yesterday morning, after being clos­

students and teachers were enjoying
their hard-earned vacation. Although
the schools were officially opened yes­
terday morning, regular sessions will

FliAZIEfi SAYS PEOPLE
if EXPECT ACTION
Next Legislature Should Act on
Some of the Things Wanted
Says Candidate
Fargo, N. D., Sept. 4.—"I am not
in position to make promises, but I
do not see why the next legislature
should not give you some of the
things you want," said Lynn J. Fra
zier, Republican nominee for gover­
nor, in an address at the Labor Day
celebration here, speaking particular­
ly to union members.
Frazier pledged himself for an em­
ployers' liability act, against child la­
bor, and regulation of time for em­
ployment of women.
"A great many people wonder why
you organized labor men are sympa­
thizers of the Non-partisan league,"
said Mr. Frazier "but it is nothing to
wonder at, at all. We all make our
living by our own toil and I believe
the farmers and the laboring men of
the state have many things in com­
mon. There are only two classes of
producers in North 'Dakota—the farm­
ers and the laboring men who work
for daily wage."
Frazier, reviewing the history of
the Non-partisan 'League movement,
declared it had its inception in the
lesson taught by organized labor dur­
ing the past half-century and in the
meantime that farmers will need sim­
ilar results for themselves ultimate
!y.
Dr. E. F. Ladd, president of the Ag
ricultural college, told the audience
the two great problems before the
nation, production and distribution,
depend on a well developed system of
education.
John N. 'Hagen, Republican nomi­
nee for commissioner of agriculture
and labor, dealt with such questions
as terminal elevators and packing
plants within the state.

BIILOIEM1
Fargo, 'N. D., Sept. 4.—Because T.
F. McCue of Carrington, former attor­
ney general, was accused of "collect­
ing a slush fund to defeat the candi­
dates of the league," referring to the
Non-partisan league, he has demand­
ed that the Co-operators' Herald of
this city make retraction.
The article in question was printed
several weeks ago.
Mr. McCue was quoted in the orig­
inal article as having bragged to At­
torney General H. J. Linde that he,
McCue, was raising a fund to defeat
the "league candidates for the su­
preme court." Mr. iMcCue, in his call
for retraction, maintains the article
is libelous.

Secretary Lansing and FrankUa
W. Lane Discuss the Situ­
ation Informally
New York, Sept. 4.—Hope for 4
broad understanding and sympathy
between the United States and Mexl*
co in the future were expressed here
today by both American and Mexican
members of the joint commission that
will meet at New London on Wed
nesday to begin its discussion of the
border difficulties. Informal address*
es were delivered by Secretary Lans
ing and Franklin W. Lane, secretary
of the interior, who heads the com"
mission, while Luis Cabrera, chair*
man of the Mexican commission, apd
Elisio Arredondo, Mexican ambassa­
dor designate, spoke in reply. Rights
of Americans in Mexico, both person*
al and economic, were the only lea*
tures mentioned by M'r. Lane.
"It is through the consideration of
such subjects that the seed of future
controversies can be destroyed," Sec*
retary Lansing said. "And entire
confidence restored, so that the Mex­
ican people and government may
build on the ruins of war and disor*
der a new and more lasting prosper*
ity than the republic has ever known*
"Our people have gone among you
in confidence," said Secretary Lane.
"Their lives and fortunes are sacred
to you and wrong done to them would
react against you even -though the
United States never raised its hand
nor sent a man across your 'border."
Speaking in response, .Mr. Cabrera
declared himself and associates to fee
"inspired by the strongest purpose
to co-operate with the American com­
missioners in order to attain their
common end, that is, to lqy. the (pun*
dation of a lasting peace between tfeq
United States and Mexico."
"We have neither the experience
nor the learning of the American
commissioners," he continued, "hot
the consciousness of the great re­
sponsibility which the conference
have, not only for the present, but
for the future of our country, will
give the iMexican commissioners the
energy sought for the welfare of the
country."
iMr. Cabrera drew a parallel of the
conditions existing as between the
United States and (Mexico.
"Even the enemies of peace 'be­
tween these two countries are the
same in both," he continued. "It
seems, therefore, that the confer*
ences will have more the character
of co-operation than a discussion of
conflicting tendencies."
The commissioners, both American
and Mexican, will sail for New 'Lon­
don tomorrow on the presidential
yacht, Mayflower. Included in the
party will be: Henry P. Fletcher, the
ambassador to Mexico, and John T.
Burns, Mexican consul general in this
city.
Secretary and Mrs. Lansing left
here this afternoon for Washington.

mittee, appointed to investigate the
different types of paving, returned
Sunday from a trip during which they
visited Fargo, Winnipeg, Ouluth, Chi­
cago, Minneapolis and St Paul.
The committee left Tuesday morn­
