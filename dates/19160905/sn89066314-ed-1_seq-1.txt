THE
lOMMITTEE TAKES UP
IT
Meeting Held Today to Dis
cuss Standardizing the
Student Labor.
INCREASE IN WAGES
Many Students Will Be Ad
vised Not to Enter the
University.
The standardization of student la
bor, a gradually increased remunera
tion for such labor and the listing of
sufficient work to accommodate the
hundreds of men who arc coming to
the University this fall expecting to
earn their way through school, is the
problem that the Y. M. C. A. is trying
' to solve just now.
The committee on student labor.
composed of faculty members, Co
lumbians and former student;, was
called into meeting this morning at
the request of Secretary J. S. Moore
to discuss the labor question. The
committee is composed of the follow
ing members: L. L. Bernard, W. E.
Wrench, C. B. Itolllns, Jr., J. B. Pow
ell, Secretary J. S. Moore, S. F. Voss
and 0. H. DeWolff.
The members decided to make a
thorough canvass of the town before
the opening of school and to list the
names of the residents and business
houses that would need student labor
during the coming year.
Secretary Moore told the committee
members this morning that more than
200 students had already written to
him for work and that by the end of
the first week of school he expected
to have in hand as many as 300 ap
plications. He said, however, that a
great many of those that usually ap
peal for work to put themselves
through school really could do with
out such assistance and that an ef
fort would be made to weed out this
number.
Aihlsi' Sonic Not (o Enter 31. U.
Because of the probable scarcity of
work to supply all the students who
apply, the committee will probably
write to a great number of the appli
cants and advise them not to attempt
to enter the University this fall un
less they have at least $150 with which
to start.
When school is under way and the
needy students arc supplied with
work, the committee will make an
effort to raise the price per hour for
those men .who render high class
services. The first work will be done
at the rate of 15 cents per hour. An
effort will be made to raise this to
17 1-2 cents and then to 20 cents.
A committee composed of J. B.
Powell, L. L. Bernard. C. B. Rollins,
Jr., and W. E. Wrench was appointed
this morning to go to the Hamilton-
Brown shoe factory and determine
the approximate numbe: of student
workmen that can be used when
school opens. Last year about twenty
five were given work at the factory.
Tain ass Residence Section.
A canvass is being made of the
residence section by Roscoe E. Harper
and the name of everyone is taken
who may want work done later in
the year.
"By the blanks the applicants for
work have to fill out and file with us
we are able to tell pretty well just
what students are really needy and
those that are not. We are going to
try and sort out those that can get
along without It," said Secretary
Moore this afternoon.
A large number of new students
arc already arriving in town and are
applying at the Y. M. C. A. for work
to make their way. One prospective
student who applied this morning
said that he only had $15 with which
to pay his expenses this year. An ef
fort will be made by the organization
to discourage these men from enter
ing school this fall.

T. F. Jcffers Inspects College of Agri
culture Backs County Agent.
T. F. Jeffers, agricultural agent of
the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Rail
road, visited the College of Agricul
ture today. He is particularly inter
ested In the county agent movement
and he is endeavoring to find out
what his railroad can do to further
that movement.
The railroad companies find that
the county agent is probably the chief
public factor in the county tending to
make farming more profitable and
thereby make shipping more profita
ble. This is convincing testimony as
to the efficiency of the county agent,
says A. J. Meyer, secretary of thc-ag-ricultural
extension department of the
University.

their invasion of Transylvania and

Rumania.
Budapest dispatches reported a halt
in the Rumanian advance near Or-

wing. On the banks of the Gerna
River the Austrians repulsed all Ru
manian attacks. Austrian artillery
tore great gaps in the Rumanian lines.
In the north on the Austrian left
wing the Rumanians crossed the Muk
los Pass, opposed by only a few Aus
trian rear guards, but when they at
tempted to fight their way across the
Maros River near the railway they
were abruptly halted by artillery
fire.
Even in the center, where the Aus
trians attempted no strong stand, the
Rumanian advance has been brought
to a standstill.

clutch. Wo were not going more
than two miles an hour when we
rolled onto the bridge. Just as we
got in the center the whole thing col
lapsed, throwing us down about eight
een feet. The bridge is about forty
feet long. The bridge was entirely
decayed and nothing but a small iron
rod at the side prevented the car
a National roadster from turning
turtle."
There Is no way by which Mr. Rol
lins can recover damages, he said. A
county is not responsible tor its bridg
es, according to the law.
