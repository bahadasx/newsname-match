SUNDAY'S BATTLE ON THE

, ' With the British Armies in France,
Sept. 3 (via London, Sept. 4) It was
"by the right flank" in the concerted
Anglo-French attack on the . Somme
front today, with the great battlo
which never has ceased for two
months flaming up into a general con
flict. Kitchener's new army, charged
the flower of the German army the
Prussian guards four divisions of
which were concentrated to stay the
British offensive. In places the Ger
man emperor's favorite troops were
driven back but counter attacked, and
again had to yield their crimsoned,
shell-wrecked trenches to stubborn
English and Scotch, most of whom
two years ago did not know how to
form fours and fought all the harder
because of the known prestige of their
foe. Never had so many guns been
in action.
The attack was not simultaneous
nor was it along the whole line. Dif
ferent sections were timed with clock
work regularity, each suiting the pur
pose of the commanders, while the
French and English acted together as
if one army.
The roar of the guns in the early
hours along the front could not have
told the observers where the blows
were to fall. Against Thiepval, that
redoubtable position, which the Brit
ish have been gradually approaching,
no effort was made. But just before
dawn their infantry rushed the old

purchase of the Danish West Indies

made to pass it at this session.
first line trenches at certain points
both north and south of the Ancre.
The first stage of. the infantry ac
tion was entirely on this flank and at
Moquet farm where the Australians
were at it again. They had " been
wanting that farm and had taken and
lost it once. Thi3 time they pushed
through and beyond it.
Later in the morning, the big busi
ness of the day began from Delvil's
wood southward through to the Som
me. All the murderous power 'on
both sides, guns and machine guns,
was exerted to the utmost. Guille
mont was the prize the British sought.
Two weeks ago this village was the
most completely devastated of any on
the front and the British had been
pounding it day after day with every'
calibre gun. Guillemont nb longer is
a village but an iron and lead mine.
Twice the British had carried their
charges into it and even through it,
only to be forced out. It is estimated
that 200,000 shells were fired into and
that 3,000,000 bullets traversed it.
WAS HAND TO HAND WORK
Sapping forward and connecting up
shell craters into trenches, the Brit
ish worked their way, aided by occas
ional charges, to the village, but the
Germans established themselves in a
small trench salient southwest of the
village, where they were only thirty
or forty yards from the British and
so near that the British guns dared
not fire on them for fear of hitting
their, own men. - v
Here the Germans had a machine
gun so placed that it swept the space
between the trenches, but the British
managed to get across and, about mid
day swept through the village of Guil
lemont, cleaning up nests of machine
guns, and across the fields on the
other side, establishing themselves on
a sunken road. But south of Guille
mont one section "of the Prussian
guard resisted desperately in Falf e-
mont farm and Wedgewood and here
all the afternoon bombing and hand
tc hand fighting was proceeding. Her
the guard had high ground which
they turned into a fortress and they
were evidently " determined to keep
faith with their prestige. No sooner
had the British taken Guillemont and
swept through it than the Germans
turned on it a tornado of shell fire
from their immense concentration of
guns in this section.
The French between the Somme
and British right, under the protec
tion of an amazing hurricane of shell
fire co-operated in a brilliant advance.
From a hill the blue of their soldiers
and the khaki of the British could be
seen side by side as they charged and,
as the trenches were taken, the green
figures of the Germans filing back to
the rear as . prisoners, completed the
spectacle under an unbroken stream of
shells overhead.

COUNCIL WILL GIVE
STATE BOARD'S
REPORT CONSIDERATION
When council meets tonight at 8
o'clock it is expected that considera
tion will be given to the report of the
state board of health received yester
day by Mayor Robertson, in which is
strongly recommended" the installa
tion of treatment beds in connection
with the Imhoff tanks of ' the new
sewerage system, for the purpose of
purifying the effluent of the tanks.
The inspection of the sewerage sys
tem by George W. Simons Jr., chief
of the bureau of engineering of the
state health board, was begun on Au
gust 7, some weeks after Bryan & Co.,
the contractors, had completed their
work, and the system had been ac
cepted by the city. Nothing was said
in council about a board of health in
spection of the system at the time of j
its acceptance by council. The reason
for an inspection of the system after
its acceptance by council, instead of
previous to its acceptance, will prob
ably be explained at tonight's meet
ing. The sewerage system for the
city -was decided on after the sewer
wells in use had been condemned and
outlawed, and it was with a view to
meeting the health laws of the state
that the present system with its Im
hoff tanks was adopted.
JOY JUICE SHIPPED IN
COFFINS FROM JACKSONVILLE
Atlanta, Sept. 5. They've got up a
new scheme in Jacksonville,' accord
ing to reliable information secured in
Atlanta, for shipping liquor into the
state of Georgia.
Instead of sending individual ship
ments in separate packages, such as
a quart or two quarts, they lump a
bunch of shipments into one shipment,
and pack them all in a box resembling
the box in which a corpse and coffin are
shipped by express.
One of these boxes will hold from
twenty to fifty shipments of two
quarts each and the method of pack
ing and handling possesses marked
advantages over the separate shipment
plan.

SEIIATE AMMEIITTO REVEII BILL IS
HERCIAL
(Associated
Washington, Sept. 5. The Senate
has adopted an amendment to the rev
enue bill authorizing the president by
proclamation to deny the use of mails,
express, telegraph, wireless or cable
facilities to citizens of nations which
do not accord American citizens al
facilities of commerce, "including un
hampered traffic in mails."
The resolution was introduced by
Senator Phelan of California. It is
declared tq be aimed particularly at
British interference with American
mails. , The amendment authorizes the
president during any war in which the
United States is not engaged to with
hold clearance from all vessels which

corded other nations from American
ships and to use the army and navy if

of offending vessels from the United

the way for adjournment not later

CREATED CONSTERNATION
The adoption of the amendments
created consternation among ally dip

than a non-intsreourse act preliminary
to commercial warfare with far
reaching possibilities. ' There were as
surances that representations would
be made if they become law. Inas
much as the government has decided
on retaliatory legislation to meet the
restraints of commerce diplomatic

NON-STOP MAXWELL
ON IMPORTANT TOUR
Famous Car is Now on the Journey to
Help the National Defense -Movement
The non-stop Maxwell, the car that
holds the world's record of 22,022
miles continuous travel without a stop
of the motor is engaged in a mission
of national importance and the trip
will carry it from Tia Juana, Mexico,
to Vancouver, Canada, and return.
It is a great loop trip that is being
made by the non-stop champion. The
route as at present outlined will carry
the party up the California and Ore
gon coasts as far as possible tiward
the northern boundary of the $nited
States; the return . itinerary hj thru
the interiors of Washington, Oregon
and California to the starting point at
the southern international line.
The highway between Mexico and
Canada generally followed by motor
ists is inland for almost the entire dis
tance. The "coast road north has been
neglected, mainly because the popula
tion is so scattered that it has been
impossible to wield sufficient influence
for a boulevard system that would
make all-year-round travel feasible.
The necessity for defending this
coast road has been pointed out in
numerable times by military experts
and one of the first important items in
making our west coast safe against
foreign invasion is to place the roads
in such condition that troops and
heavy armanent could be moved ex
peditiously in motor trucks and auto
mobiles. Every detail of the topography is
being carefully noted by the Maxwell
party. The road is being logged and
at the conclusion of the expedition, a
report will be submitted to the fed
eral authorities and to the officials of
the states through which the tour ex
tends. The non-stop Maxwell is carrying
as passengers Wilbur Hall and Albert
Gill Waddell, widely known as maga
zine writers, and Jack Griffin, touring
expert.
Along the coast towns, the non-stop
Maxwell is attracting great attention.
The service-scarred veteran had tra
veled more than ' 35,000 miles before
starting on its latest tour, and the
original covers on its motor and trans
mission are yet to be removed for an
overhauling of any sort of the inter
ior workings.-
Mr. W. O. Brewer, one of the livest
citizens of the northwest quarter of
the county, was in town today. Mr.
Brewer is much interested in school
affairs, and he reports good openings
for the Romeo and Buck Pond schools.
Eoth openings were well attended by
patrons. Miss Eula Goldby teaches at
