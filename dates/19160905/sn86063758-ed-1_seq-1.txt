IA11 persons who tare interested in
luore livestock and better 'livestock
"will please meet with the association
I at Newberry court nouse ~on oepiem-,
<fcer 9 th, 11 o'clock.
A nua^ber of farmers l.N.'e spoken
to me about some pure bred sires aai
also some Heifers to be ordered this
fall. All those who contemplate buykg
anything tfiis fall will please at
Bend this meeting and let us know ex
Hrctly what you. want. We can buy
Hbexn cooperatively, cheaper than we
Bean separately. Also we can get betHter
s)tock by sending an expert lo
Wselect them than ?we can by sending
a im&il order.
f The man who goes after them gets
all t&e best of the herd, the man who
orders bv mail usually gets the culls.
We also wish to know about hov I
many feeders will be wanted this
l winter in the county so that we ca 1 j
t get .prices and locate cattle.
Owing to the coming of boll weevil, |
Kthere is considerable interest new in;
Hthe livestock business.
V The people of the south will always 1
raise some cotton under bool weevil1
conditions, but they can no longer de
pend wholly on cotton, but must reKsort
to something else.
b. Naturallv we will turn to hay tan-1
five stock. Our climate is ideal for
otih, and they tooth go hand in hand.
Ye have very little use for one with
ut the other so lets fall in line and
f gin "both. Start in the livestock
usiness toy getting a pure tored sire,
tart in the hay business toy sowing j
I
Ksome clover, vetch, rye; cowpeas, exc.
Grow your feeds on the farm, market'
P them through livestock and the fertilf
ity to the soil.
An expert' livestock man from the
extension division will be here to ad- j
<dress the association. Also Dr. Geo. j
I Y. Hunter who has ' just returned

HIS FATE A MYSTERY.

of ths "Signers" Died.
By a strange trick of fate Thomaa

Declaration of Independence, was also

fcji? arsu uue vi lueae xxitru lu ure.
Lynch was born In Prince George
parish, S. C., Aug. 5, 1749. He was
only twenty-six when the congress declared
the independence of the colonies.
Ill health compelled hira to leav?
congress soon afterward, and near tho
close of 1779 he embarked on a vessel,
intending to go to Europe for the benefit
of his health.
The ship on which he sailed was
never heard of afterward, and tho
fate of the youngest of the "signers"
remains a mystery. It is supposed, of
c- 'irse, that the ship sank and that
Lynch and all on board were drowned*
but fhere were rumors that it was
blown out of its course in a storm and
wrecked on a lonely island of the West
Indies and that some of the passengers
and crew were saved.
Thomas Lynch was educated in Eng

The Trade Winds.
1 The constancy of trade winds is dne
to the permanence of the conditions
which rule them. As the heated air at
the equator ascends surface winds set
In from north and south and. uniting,
ascend in their turn and flow off in
opposite directions. As the velocity of
the earth's revolution from east to
west is much greater at the equator
than at the poles, wind blowing along
ita ?Trrfflop thp enimtor is constantly
arriving at places which have a higher
velocity than itself: hence it is retarded
and must lag behind, and under the
Influence of two opposing forces it is
compelled -to take an intermediate di-.
rection, so that what was originally a
north wind is deflected and flows
southwest, while what started as a
south wind becomes northwest. From
the great service they have rendered
to navigation these reliable winds are
called trade .winds.

Jn Hot Water.
Two citizens were toddling up rho
street one day recently, earnestly ongaged
in exchanging their experien^*with
dyspepsia.
"And did you ever try the hot water
cure?" asked the thin one.
"Did I?" repeated the melancholy
one, who bad also something of the
saving grace of humor in his makeup,
as many melancholy men have, "I
should say I did. Why, man, I've been
married fifteen years."
All Fop the Best.
"Why do the rosea fade slowly
away?" she inquired poetically.
"Well," replied the baldheaded
young man, "when you think it over
it's all for the best,. It's more comfortable
to-have them fafle slowly
away than to go off all of a sudden,
like a torpedo."
