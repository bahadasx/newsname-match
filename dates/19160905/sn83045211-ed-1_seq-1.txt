In the north, on the Austrian left wing,
the Rumanians crossed the Gyergo Szent

guards. But when they attempted to fight
their way serosa the Maros River, near the

artillery fire.
Even in the center, where the Austrians

Crucial Series in National

By CHANDLEK D. RICHTER
BRAVES" FEILD, Boston, Mass., Sept.
5. Alexander tho Great went to the mound
In the first game of today's double-header,
while Jess Barnes, who has been unusually
effective ngnlnst tho Phillies, was selected
by Manager Stalllngs to keep tho Braves In
first place.
At least 35,000 spectators were expected
today, but when tho first gamo Btartcd less
than 10,000 persons wcro on hand, as the
day was too cool. Tho thermometer took
n, sudden drop this morning nnd tho sun
disappeared. A cold wind blowing across
tho field mado it extremely unpleasant for
players and fans, whllo fly balls bothered
tho fielders.
Tho present series Is tho most Important
of tho season In tho National League, as It
Is generally believed that cither tho Phillies
or Braves will be put out of tho running;
tho two teams started "riding" each other
right from tho Jump.
"Rabbit" Maranvlllc, tho Braves' wonder
ful shortstop, sustained a fractured nose
fielding a ground ball In tho afternoon game
yesterday, but ho Insisted on plnylng today.
The Phils got tho flint run of tho game,
when Niehoff stole homo ns Cravath pilfered
Becond. Tho Braves assumed tho lead In
tho fifth when Wllholt pinch-batted and
singled, scoring Konetchy, followed by an
other tally mado on Barnes's Infield out,
Smith scoring. Three singles wero mado
off Alex In this round.
A slxth-lnnlng rally of three hits, nldcd
by Chappclle'a throw, which hit Cravath,
gavo Moron's men thrco runs and tho lead
again. Stock, Cravath nnd 'Whitted wcro
tho men to cross tho plate.
FIRST INNING
Smith made a gloved-hand stop nnd threw
out Paskert. Niehoff Rlngled to center nnd
stole second. Stock sent a long fly to Ma
gee, Nlohoff taking third after the catch.
Cravath walked. The double Bteal was suc
cessful, Niehoff soorlng aa Cravath -stole
second. Mageo pulled down Whltted's long
drive. One run, one hit, no errors.
Bancroft threw out Maranvlllc. Snod
grass was called out on strikes. Luderus
made a great catch of Bancroft's throw,
retiring Chappello. No runs, no hits, no
errors.
SECOND INNING
Luderus filed to Snodgrass. Bancroft
walked. Klllefer popped to Maranvllle.
Alexander forced Bancroft, Smith to Egan.
No runs, no hits, no errors.
Magee struck out. Bancroft captured
Konetchy's foul. Smith beat out a slow
bounder to Stock. Smith died stealing,
Klllefer to Bancroft. No runs, one hit, no
errors.

MBRION1 CRICKET CLUB. HAVER.
FORD, Ia., Sept 5. More than BOO morn
ing fans were thrilled by the first round of
match play today at the Merlon Golf Club
for the amateur golf championship of the
United States. Chick Evans, open cham
pion of America and considered abroad as
America's finest player, was only 1 up at
the end of the first 18 holes of the all-day
grind. He was matched up with Nelson
Whitney, the southern phenom, who recent
Jy won tho Invitation tovlrney at South
ampton and figured prominently In the na
tional last year.
The golf of the open champion was not
very speedy as to score, mostly for the rea
son that he missed putts time and again.
Evans certainly justified the title he bears
as the country's "worst" putter. He will
have to Epeed up his game considerably
this afternoon In order to come through in
his fond ambition, the winning of the ama
teur championship. He once was a finalist,
but he never has been able to burst out In
front.
Bob Gardner, the present champion, had
little trouble with John M. Ward, a former
s(ar shortstop of the tew York Giants
and Brooklyn Fed magnate, aa well as vet
eran golfer. Gardner was 8 up, which was
almost too much for the veteran Ward to
overcome when he teed off Jhls afternoon
In the second round.
George Hoffner, Woodbury, one of the
best local players that qualified, was 3
down at, the end of the first round to Clark
E. Corkran. whose 7S was better ahan
IfoffDer's 85- .
One of the best tnatcbe was that between
Ned Sawyer, who put Chick Evans out of
jb, nationual last year, and John G. Ander
son, a finalist last year. Anderson JinUhad

CAM, roil THE INQUIRY
To tho Editor of tho Evening Ledger:
Sir As a member of a committee of
cltlscns who have been Investigating
the narcotlo drug habit In this city I
have been appalled by the Increase In
the use of these drugs which has oc
curred since the recent decision of the
United States Supremo Court HmfHii0
tho efficiency of the Jtarrison anti
narcotic law.
The spread of the drug habit con
stitutes, In my opinion, a real national
peril.
The injurious effect of nnrcotlo drugs
on the moral and physical health of
tho victims Is, I believe, an important
factor In the amount of crime commit
ted In Philadelphia
IVouM it not bo fitting that your
newspaper, as one Interested In the
welfare of tho community, should make
known to the public the true state of
affairs In this cltyt If the situation
were generally fcnoion and tho danger
appreciated I feel sure that such a pub
Uc sentiment would be aroused that
some remedy for the evil would be
quickly provided. Yours truly,
Dtt. HORATIO C. WOOD, Jr.
Doctor Wood Is a member of tho
ettttens' comvxtttee appointed nbotit a
year ago by Untied States District At
torney Francis Fisher Kane for tho In
vestigation of tho narcotic-drug evil In
Philadelphia. Doctor Wood also is
chairman of the narcotlo drugs com

For If the 16,000 were confined to tho

Jennie, 19 years old (lower) , today,

years old, who wero drowned yesterday
when their canoo was upset by four meat

The river , ojnnoalte Lardner's Point,

white-haired father of the girls patrolled
the river bank since early morning watch
ing the'surfaco of tho river. He Is on
tho verge of collapse. Tears have given,
way to .quiet resignation. Frequently he
declared that If ho had tho men who..
caused tho death of his daughters he wouIqT"1
show them no mercy. He said their action
In upsetting the boat was nothing less than
cold-blooded murder.
FAMILY'S FIUE.VDS AROUSED
His Indignation Is shared by the section.
It Is likely If the men were found by th
people there would be little time wasted la
legal steps. The mother of the girls, wha
Is at her home, 1910 Bridge street, does
not realize that her daughters are dead.
Tho, woman is dazed by the tragedy. J3h

The girls were good swimmers, and Jen
nie, the older, had won several trophies la
Bwimmlng events.
The police have n very meager descrlp- -tlon
of the men in tha boat and are run
