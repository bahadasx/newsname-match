ing, In co-operation with Lakevlew,

complete pictures of the route of the
proposed Strahorn railroad, the local
lallrnad committees and directors of

ler, local scenic photographer.
It ib planned to have made pictures
of the right of way, all valleys, tim
ber and other resources along the nn-
;tlre 70 miles of the new railroad,
The making of these pictures will
mean the outlay of a large amount of
moeey, but is believed to be necessary
;o show poople the possibilities of the
country through which the road is to
P(M.
Making or the pictures was pro
posed by Robert E. Strahorn, builder
of tho road, who suggested that the
principal communities to be benefited
by the road share with him the cost
of having them taken. He ha. asked
the communities to settle for them
selves what portion of the cost ealch
should bear, and what portion be
should pay
It is expected that Mr. Miller will
be engaged to take the picture., a.
he Is a scenic photographer of ability,
and 1. willing to make a price lower
than the regular rate a. hit contribu
tion toward getting the new railroad,
