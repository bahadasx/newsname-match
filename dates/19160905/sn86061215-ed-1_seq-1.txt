WILSON TO SIGN
BILL SECOND TIME
Not to Chance Any Question
Because of Signing It
on Legal Holiday
Washington, D. C., Sept. 4.—Rail
road service throughout the nation
continued as usual this morning and
tb« strike which had been ordere.d did
not come to pass because on Saturday
Bight congress passed a law which vir
tually granted the demands of the four
railroad brotherhoods. The rescind
ing of the strike order followed imme
diately after the bill passed the sen
ate. Peace in the railroad world is
now assured for the next nine months
at least. At the end o* that time the
natter is to be definitely settled. The
Indications are that the railroads will
'light the constitutionality of the law
passed Saturday night.
President Wilson signed the railroad
eight hour day bill yesterday morning.
A question arose as to the legality of
signing the bill on a legal holiday, so
to circumvent an action on this line,
the president will again affix his sig
nature to the bilf tomorrow morning.
Vote on Party Lines.
The legislative expedient by which
congress averted the strike was pass
ed In the house Friday afternoon and
In the senate Saturday night. In the
senate the vote was 43 to 28, almost
a strict party vote taken amidst rio
tous scenes, after many senators, dem
ocrats and republicans, had fought des
perately to amend the measure by
provisions designed to prevent indus*
trial disasters in the future. Some
senators declared congress was being
coerced into enactment of legislation
that it did not desire, and that it knew
would return to plague it in the future.
In froth houses the measure was sign
ed within a few minutes after the final
vote in the senate, and it was sent at
once to the white house. Officials of
the brotherhoods who witnessed the
final passage of the bill had* announced
early in the night that cancellation of
the strike would not be ordered until
the bill had been signed by the presi
dent and actually had become law. But
later they conferred and changed their
signalling to the waiting trainmen of
... signalling to the waiting tarinmen of
the country through their chairmen
the message that a satisfactory settle
ment had been obtained.
Features of Bill.
The bill that stopped the strike pro
vides that after January 1, 1917, eight
lours shall be regarded as a basis of
reckoning for a day's wage of men en
gaged in the operation of railroad
trains in interstate commerce (except
ing roads less than 100 miles long and
•lectric lines) that they shall receive
pro rata pay for work in excess of
eight hours and that the rate of com
pensation shall not be changed pend
ing an investigation for six or nine
months of the effect of the eight hour
day upon the railroads by a commis
sion to be appointed by the president
Amendment Defeated.
Efforts to amend the bill in the sen
ate were futile, the supreme effort to
alter it having been led by Senatqr
Underwood, who sought to provide
that the interstate commerce commis
sion should have power to fix railroad
wages and hours of service in the fu
ture. This amendment was defeated
by a vote of 57 to 14.
A Party Vote.
Only two democrats, Senators Hard
wick of Oeorgia and Clark of Arkansas
voted againBt the bill, and one repub
lican, La Follette of Wisconsin, veiled
for it. The roll call follows:
For the bill:

S EFFORTS BEING
7
MADE ALREADY TO
AMEND NEW LAW
MANY SENATORS DO NOT WISH
TO AWAIT REPORT OF PRESI
DENT'S COMMISSION.
Washington, D. C., Sept. 4. —Sena
tor Reed of Missouri today introduced
a resolution ^o authorize the interstate
commerce commission to Investigate
the effect of the eight hour day law on
the cost of operation of railroads and
to report to congress in December.
The resolution' will be called up for
consideration tomorrow.
It is very evident that a great many
senators are not satisfied with the
temporary settlement of the railroad
pr (blem as effected and that they will
await the report of the president's
icial investigating commission to be
efforts to change the law. After
the passage of the bill Saturday night,
republican senators and a few of the
democrats declared unhesitatingly that
congress was being coerced, driven "un
der the gun to the passage of the
eight hour bill without any provision
of* a permanent character. Leading
progressive republicans, among them
Cummins, Kenyon and Norris, said
that labor was getting a bad bargain,
"a brassy gold brick," a "humbug," and
that they were conceding to congress
the right to legislate on the question of
wages, but In their opinion the 400,000
trainmen of the organizations affected
would not approve if it should be put
up to them for a vote. But cham
pions of the Adamson bill said In re
ply that to amend the bill wotild mean
that the strike would not be stopped.
This line of argument won the day and
not only prevented the adoption of the
Underwood amendment, but also serv
ed to defeat an amendment by Sena
tor Newlands to make interference
with the operation of railroad trains
a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
and imprisonment and an amendment
by Senator LaFollette to make certain
that the law should not be construed
to repeal or modify the railroad hours
of service law which prohibits railroad
men from working continuous more
than sixteen hours.

KITCHENER ARMY
KAISER'S WONDERFUL SOLDIER8
FIND DIFFICULTY IN STOP
PING BRITONS.
With the British Armies in France,
Sept 8 (Via London) Sept. 4. —It was
"by the right flank" in the concerted
Anglo-French attack on the Somme
front today, with the great battle
which never has ceased for two
months flaming up into a general con
flict, that Kitchener's new army charg
ed the flower of the Germany army—
the Prussian guards—four divisions of
which were concentrated before the
British to stay the British offensive.
In places the emperor's favorite troops
were driven back, counter attacked
and again had to yield their crimsoned,
shell wrecked trenches to stubborn
English and Scotch, most of whom two
years ago did not know how to form
fours.
Actions Closely Timed.
The attack was not simultaneous nor
was it along the whole line. Different
sections were timed with clockwork
regularity, while the French and Eng
lish acted together as if one army.
By the roar of the guns in the early
morning along the whole front no ob
server could have told where the
blows were to fall. Against Thlepval
np effort was made. But Just before
dawn their infantry rushed the old
first line of trenches at certain paints
both north and south of the Ancre.'
The first stage of the infantry ac
tion was entirely on this flank and at
Moquet farm where the Australians
were at It again. They pushed through
It and beyond it. Nothing more pic
turesque had happened in the Somme
battle than these hardy ranchmen who
can shoot and ride, smooth shaven, la
conic, bred out of doors, going against
the Prussian guards.
Later in the. morning, the big busi
ness of the day began from Devils'
wood southward through to the
Somme. All the murderous power on
both sides, guns and machine funs,
-was exerted to-the utmost.-""**"-
Guillemont Now a Mine.
Guillemont was the prize the Brit
ish sought. Two weeks ago this vil
lage was the most completely devas
tated of any on the front and the Brit
ish had been pounding it day after day
with every caliber of gun. Guillemont
no longer Is a village but an iron and
lead mine. Twice the British had car
ried their charges into it and even
through it, only to be forced out. It
is estimated that 200,000 shells were
fired Into it and 3,000,000 bullets tra
versed it.
Sapping forward and connecting up
shell craters into trenches, the British
worked their way, aided by oocasional
charges, but the Germans had estab
lished themselves in a small trench
salient southwest of the village where
they were only thirty or forty yards
from the British and so near that the
the British guns dared not flre on them
for fear of hitting their own men.
Here the Germans had a machine
gun so placed that it swept the space
between the trenches but the British
managed to get across and about mid
day, swept through Guillemont, clean
ing up nests of machine guns and
across the fields on the other side,
establishing themselves in a sunken
road.
But south of Guillemont one section
of the Prussian guard resisted desper
ately in Falfemont farm and Wedge
wood and here the afternoon bombing
and hand to hand fighting were pro
ceeding. Here the guard had high
ground which they turned into a for
tress.
No sooner had the British taken
Guillemont and swept through it than
the Germans turned on It a tornado of
•hell flre from their Immense concen
tration of guns.
Many Prisoners Taken.
The French, between the Somme and
the British right, under the protection
of an amazing hurricane of shell fire,
cooperated in a brilliant advance.
From a hill the blue of their soldiers
and the khaki of the British could be
seen side by side as they charged and,
as the trenches were taken, the green
figures of the Germans filing back to
the rear as' prisoners, completed the
spectacle under an unbroken stream
of shells overhead.
Prussian guard prisoners taken said
the German emperor had let it be
known to his troops that there would
be no winter campaign. They believ
ed the decision of the war was com
ing in this summer's fight and in the
fighting of the next month.
The fiercest struggle of all was for
the possession of Ginchy. When the
Associated Press correspondent left
the corps headquarters the British had
more than half the village and the
struggle amidst the ruins hidden by
curtains of shell smoke was bitterly
continuing.

The various school buildings have
undergone alterations and improve
ments of one kind or another during
the summer months for the comfort
and convience of the pupils. The first
Monday in September is usually the
time for beginning the fall term of
school, but owing to it also being
Labor day, a holiday is given the
youngsters and Tuesday is the open
ing day of the term.
More than 5,000 children of various
ages attend the local schools, Jhe en
rollment for last year being 5,175,
which will be Increased this year.
Principal Rice of the high school,
said today that the enrollment for this
year In the high Bchool will be about
750, with probably more to come later.
This Is In excess of last year. The
additional number of pupils and
change of schedules to meet the con
gested condition has made it necessary
to employ four more teachers in the
building.
The Sacred Heart school at Fifth
and Court streets, has undergone ex
tensive improvements during the vaca
tion periods. The alterations have
been made both in aide and outside the
building. New cement steps at the
Fifth street entrance have been put in
replacing the old wooden porch and
steps. The various rooms have been
gone over and some of them repaper
ed, the plumbing repaired and addi
tional facilities added.
A big enrollment is expected at St.
Joseph's academy north of the city,
where during the summer normal was
taught and ISO students attended the
vacation school for twelve weeks. The
mother superior reports that students
for the term opening Wednesday are
now coming in fast and ninety have
already reported, with many more in
prospect. These come from not only
in this vicinity, but from all over Iowa
and Illinois as well.

SLAYER OF RIDE
Chicago, Sept. 4. —John M. Pettlt,
confessed slayer of his bride of a
month, is under guard at the Bridewell
hospital where it is believed he haa a
chance to recover from the injuries he
sustained yesterday in jumping
through the window of a train which
was taking him, in captivity, bank to
Chicago at the rate of a mile a minute.
Pettlt was captured near Detroit
where he had gone after cutting the
throat of his wife last Thursday.
Pettlt made his spectacular attempt
at escape while the train was near
Michigan City, Ind. He suddenly broke
away from the police sergeant who
was guarding him, and rushing to a
window, he dove through, head fore
most.
The train was stopped and Pettlt
was recaptured. He was trying to walk
away, but was rather seriously injur
ed. An examination later showed that
he bad a punctured lung, broken ribs
and an Injured Jaw. That he escaped
death was probably due to his landing
on a sandy spot.
The slayer admits his crime. In his
confession, he says:
"I killed her to save her parity, but
she is not dead. I killed her mate
rially, but spiritually she still Uvea,"
Pettlt said.
"She never fell when I cut her. I
had my arm arouM her neck when I
did It. I Just laid her down on the
floor."
"Other men called and talked to her.
I was Jealous of them. I was. wrong
in that," he said at another point
Pettlt said that he put his arm
around his young wife's neck and told
her what he Intended to do.
"I was Insanely jealous of her," he
declared. "I wanted her to enter the
spiritual life, but not on this plane. 1
alone am to blame. Her mother was
very good."
Chief Larkin would not hazard an
opinion as to whether Pettlt Is hope
lessly Insane. He Is sure the man has
been a religious fanatic.
