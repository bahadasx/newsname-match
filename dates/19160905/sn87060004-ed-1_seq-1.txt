URGES HUNTERS -TO
BE CAREFUL
U. S. Forest Service Issues
Warning Against Causing
Accidents With Firearms
and Starting .Fires
Washington, September 4. Em
phasizing the destruction of property
and human life caused by careless
hunters, a warning issued by the For
est Service urges all sportsmen on the
National Forests to use the greatest
possible care to prevent forest fires
and to avoid such accidents as the
one which caused the deatli of Forest
Ranger Clark on the Cabinet National
Forest in Montana last year. Mr,
Clark, it is said, was mistaken for
bear by a careless hunter who fired
without waiting to be sure what he
was shooting at. To show that such
accidents are not uncommon, the
warning quotes an estimate of the
Biological durvey that- between 150
and 200 persons are annually killed
in hunting accidents in this country
and that this number is increasing,
Furthermore, it is stated, 15 per cent
of all the forest fires in the National
Forest are caused by careless hunters
and other campers.
The National Forests, it is pointed
out, contain the best hunting grounds
in the country. The number of game
animals is increasing on account of
the protection from forest fires and
illegal killing which is afforded by
Forest officers. On many of the
Forests, deer, elk, mountain sheep
and many other species are fairly
plentiful, while small game is usually
abundant. Bear, mountain lion and
ether predatory animals are found on
most of the Forests and the killing
of these meat eaters is encouraged be
:ause they prey on domestic stock
and the herbivorous game animals.
The best indication of a man's fit
ncss to be in the woods, the warning
points out, is the eare which he shows
in handling lTrearms and fire. None
but the most inexperienced tender-
- foot will snoot without getting a plain
view of his game, while the man who
lets his campfire escape or who eare
lessly drops a lighted match or hot
tooacco ashes betrays at once his ig
norance of the fundamental principles
of woodcraft. Such men, says the
warning, should keep out of the
woods,
Will Try Cinders
In Road Building
An experiment will be tried on the
state aid road between Earlington and
Mortons Gap road which, if success,
ful, will mean a saving of many
thousand of dollars, to the taxpayers
of Kentucky. '1 he plan is to use a
composition of cinders 'and clay on
the road instead of the usual stone
This will be the first time this nielli
od of road building has been tried in
Kentucky.
Road building experts have come
to the conclusion that this composi
tion will prove just as durable as
stone, if not superior. Some say
that during the first year the road
may be a little soft, but that in the
course of two or three years it will
harden and make an ideal, pike.

How About Your Health?
What proflteth a man that lie
gain the whole world yet lose his
health?'
Naturalists say that long ago
tho prehistoric waters were in
festedjwith a species of enormous
shark whioh finally becamo ex
tinct by reason of the workings
of its voracious appetite. Thus
nature eliminates the over-fed.
Tho desire for ease of life and
plentifnl diet is universal and is
tho greatest stimulus of man and
animals,, alike. When man be
comes greedy and tukes more
easo and food and drink than is
his share, nature discards him.
In tho race for power and
place, for ease of circumstance
and relief from the stimulus of
hunger, the modern man in apt
to forget that unless he is care
fnl of his body he wi 1 soon be
made to suffer for the infraction
of nature's inexorable physical
law With the loss in body tone
comes an equal loss in mental
acuity and tho brain which for a
time was able to operate despite
tho complaints of an over-fed,
under-exercised, self-poisoned
body, stops, working.
Statisticians havo discovered
that the mortality rato of per-
sons in the United States over
45. years of ago is increasing. The
strenuous life of today is not
alone responsible for this. Lack
of hoalth-giving exercise, super
fluity of diet, lack of restoring
sleep, over-stimulation, the high
pressure of the race for power,
wealtii and position, plus physi
cal neglect, those bring early
decay. Tne goal is reached
wealth is amassed honor, posu
tion and power aro just being
grasped when the applo of ac
complishment turns to the ashes
of dissolution. The brilliant mind
becomes clouded, the steady
hand is no longer nccurate, the
eyo wnicu once, gazed toarlessiy
on the whole world is dimmed
and it is not long before tho final
break-up occurs, A1 of this was
entirely preventable1.
Other things being equal it is
the man who leads the well
balanced life who lasts the long
est, whose work to tho end i
uniformly the best, ho who
neither over-works nor over
plays, neither over-oats, over
drink, nor over-sleeps, he who
maintains a standard of simple
healthy diet in moderation, who
offsets menial work with physi
cat recreation, who is aj honest
with his own body as he is with
his own business. Wheu success
comes to such a one his physical
and mental condition is such tint
he oau enjoy in peace of mind
and contentment of body tho
fruits of his labors.

.. to That Effect
The force at the round house., and
on the rip "track will be doubled in a
short time. Orders have beenre
ceived by the proper officials to do
this and business will begin to pick
up at this end of the line. The main
reason for this increase is the scarcity
of coal cars, these, cars have been
sent to New Decatur. Ala , for repair
heretofore, but the haul is too long
and the Howell shops are overwork'
ed, consequently the company has
decided to have a good portion of
this work done at Earlington, which
is the obviously proper place, as it is
in the center of the coal field where
the cars are needed.

Straightening Out Mexico
Several weeks ago a prominent
congressman, speaking at at an
important gathering in Washing,
ton, disclosed what lie said was an
attempt upon the part of the ad
ministration to have .General
Fnnston recommeud the with
drawal of the American troop
from Mexico. The latest (level
opment is that General Fuueton
has made such a recommenda
tion. The actual withdrawal has
beon going on for some time. The
National Guard, which is pro
teoting the border', is made up of
some of the best material there is
in tiie country, but it is appar
ent that this is rather a disjoint
ed organization, and that, its
members are not partionlaily
adapted nor well equipped for
the task of invading a foreign
country. Wheu these troops weut
to the Mexican border nearly
everyone supposed that there
would be an. invasion, or an at
tempt at intervention. No one
seriously believed that General
Pershing's column waB being
strengthened for tho "simple pur
pose of hunting out a lot of rag-
muffins who had shot up an
American town. However, there
appears to have beeu a recur
renco to methods of inquiry and
ami negotiation, that may have
grown out of tho alarums of war.
There is a good deal of quiet
comfort about Washington in the
growing belief that tho Carranza
adminietratiou may, after all, be
alia to handle the Mexican sit
uation. No less a person than
Secretary Lane, whom many re
gard as the slrougest man in

THE STRENOUS
MR. WILSON
Ngbody can accuse President
Wilson of having displayed any
lack of energy in tho handling of
negotiations intended to preven'
the strike. It is the ordinary
custom of the President of the
United States business. Guard
laus of the health of the Presi
dent insist that he must not be
overcrowded. The precedents all
require that people whowish to
see the President shall accomo
date tnemseives to his conven
ience and time. Even in the
handling of accute conditions
with Germany and Mexico, Mr,
Wilson adharred rather closely
to his routine office hour?. He
insisted, in his dealings with the
railroad officials and operators,
that he was acting as the friend
of all interested parties, and his
anxiety to achieve success was
shown by the fact that his week
end vacations wore cancelled,
and the audiences' and confer.
ences held were held at the-White
House evening?, Sundays, and at
all times when it seemed prob
able any Rood might be accom
plished. The president made sev
eral trips to tho.capitrl, and even
visited senators in their ofllcep.
This latter procedure, hap, per
haps, never been adopted by .any
other president.
The personal point of view of
the administration evidently aB
sumed that the public rights
were paramount to those of the
disputant railroad managers and
operator?. Mr. Wilson, as the
chosen representative ef the
American nation, doubtless suc
ceeded in impressing upon the
parties to tho controversy the
right of the government to in
terfere. The neroics were equal
to those employed by former
President Itoosevelt in the set
tlement of the autbracito coal
strike, or in his interference in
the Kasslan-Japauese war. Mayor
Mitchel of New York took the
same view of the recent street
car strike in New York. His suc
cess might possibly have served
as an iucentive to Mr. Wilson to
apply official force in the crisis
of railroad bffair?. lu any event.
the activity of the president has
demonstrated that there is a new
way of doing, thiugs, and the
method appears to couferm to
the notions of prnuxessiveuess
npv? popular wHu tho American
peopiq.

WANTED A HOME FOR
AN ORPHAN CHILD
"To the citizens of Kentucky:
The work of the Kentucky Child
ren's Home Society has grown to
such an extent that we find ourselves
always overcrowded with children.
We are extremely anxious to placet
our children in good Christian homes,
and in this connection we will have,
an exhibit at the State Fair this year,
with rest and lounging room for your
convenience.
Our workers will be on the grounds
and will be only to glad to escort you
to the Home or will bring such
children as you are interested in, to
the Fair.Grounds for you to see.
We have in the Receiving Home
225 children, of all ages, frorh ba
bies a few months old up to girls and
boys 12, 13 and 14 years old. When.
you realize that there are 120 coun
ties in the State, and there is only
one agency to receive destitute child
ren, you will realize what a burden
is upon you.
We are making an appeal to the
citizens of Kentucky, as we cannot
place our children in other States,
and we hope that you will open your
hearts and your homes to these little
children, and give them a chance in
your homes. The success of our
work is due to the fact that so nuny
of our friends have taken these child
ren into their homes, and now at the
beginning of the Fall Season, when
the demands from the counties will
be so great, it is imperative for us to
place a number of our children in.
family homes.
If you will take a child you will
find that you will have trouble
enough and pleasure enough to com
pensate any effort you may make.
and you will unconsciously and indi
vidually do a great work for the Home
and for the future citizenship of our;
Commonwealth.
"It is more blessed to give than fo
receive" and to give a child a chance
to become a good- citizen is one of
the highest privileges that comes to 1
family. Please think this matter ov
er and if you want to make applica
tion for a child, we will be glad to-
take up the matter with you,
No family who have northe high
est moral standing need apply for a.
child. The work is non-sectarian;
members of any Chursh may make
application for the children. Our
object is to place our children in good
Christian homes, where they will not
only be given the advantages of
Church and school but will receive a.
religious home-training.
Hoping that this will make an im
pression on the citizens of Kentucky,
and that you will call to see our
Exhibit at the State Fair, I remain,
Yours very respectfully,
