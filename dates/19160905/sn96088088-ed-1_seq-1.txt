Hani Eit By Ruling.
he tuition of pupils attending So
ts i high school Irom districts out
1 3 of Salem will be $72.57 for the
i 'tig year. Pupils from other eoun
J will be assessed the difference be-
n $72.57 and $40, the latter
S unt being paid by the eounty in
J h the student has residence. Half
.iis difference, or $16.29, is pay-
p at the beginning of each semes
:. The tuition as fixed is $2.43 un-
i r the $75 proposed at a recent meet'
t . Perhaps the people most affect-
' . by the ruling of the Salem school
ird, are the parents of the 31 Polk
uty students living in Eola, West
m, Brush College and Mountain
.ew who sent their children to Salem
h school last year and the still
jer number that are oontemplating
e same action this year,
"It seems strange," said County
'.ool Superintendent Reynolds when
8 heard of the Salem board's action.
"We do not charge more than the
10 allowed us by the state law under
thidh we are working,! and under
which Marion county is working, and
we ore glad to get the students from
1e outside counties. I do not be-
ve the high tuition charged by the
.em school board would stand the
t of a court action. "
'he following resolution, passed bv
3 Salem board, when submitted by
wtor H. O. White, explains the
J action:
"...solved, That the tuition of stu-
s attending the high school from
; county and other counties oper-
under the old county high
l law be placed at $72.57. This
.th the understanding that Polk
y and other counties under the
i school law pay $40 of this
t for each student and that the
iy the balance, half at the
muerence as to what it
.j e .ucate a student. The Sa-
ard of directors figured inter-
a investment and depreciation,
the state department of educa-
wntends that the investment in
's, buildings and depreciation
. J not be considered in figuring
c t of doing business. Chairman
. e r ported that the board's attor-
ey. eo. G. Bingham, was working on
rublem.
" e injustice to this county of the
a board's tuition charge may be
nd.rstood when the following clip
inf from the Salem Capital Journal
f (September 2 is read :
Pupils living in Marion county in
liich there is no high school will be
emutted to attend the Salem high
;hool for the first semester without
eying tuition. This was decided at
re meeting of the board of education
ist evening, pending a decision of
le court to the amount the board may
igally charge. Those in other coum
cs coming under the old high school
iw will be obliged to pay $16.29 a
?mester. For the grades below that
re taught in the three junior hign
:liools, the annual tuition was fixed
t $30 end for students in the junior
igh schools, $40 a year.
Anyhow, pupils in Marion county
ith no liigh school in their district
ill not pay tuition for the first se
icster as their tuition will be paid by
le districts in which they live.

COMPANY L WENT THROUGH
SALEM THIS MORNING.
Troops Are Happy to Get Back Vis
itors Not Welcome at Camp
Withycombe.
Home again! Oregon boys, mem
bers of the United States army in
camps in southern California the past
ten weeks, are at Clackamas today.
They are home, probably for good.
Whether they will be discharged or
kept in camp at Clackamas for some
time has not been announced. It is
likely they will not be kept longer at
the state concentration camp than
necessary to complete the mustering
out as the daily expense of main
taining the troops is enormous.
The Third Battalion passed through
Ashland last night, at 7:30, and
tlirough Salem early this morning.
The boys of this battalion were sched
uled to arrive at Clackamas this mora
ine at 8:30. The First Battalion was
at Roseburg at 8:4o last night.
According to the officers in com
mand the troops are in the best of
condition. The sanitary troops are
given a good aeai or. crenii ior me
. , 1 O fL
cleanliness of the camps and the lack
of any disease epidemics- is largely the
result of their work. Governor Withy
combe met the troops of the First
Battalion at 'Grants Pass yesterday
and thanked the men for the splendid
ehowinff thev have made for the state.
Everv town along the fcoutharn ra
cific turned out to greet the boys.
Colonel McLaughlin has announced
that visitors will not be welcome at
Camp Withvcombe until after Friday
of this week as it will take the troops
that long to become settled. After
Fridav the relatives of the troops and
the public in general will be welcom
ed. An announcement will be made
when the camp is in readiness.

ENTHUSIASM IS LACKING

RECALL MEETING FAILS TO A'
TRACT AN ATTENDANCE.
Charge of Extravagance and Irregu
larities Evidently Not Endorsed
by Taxpayers of County.
The meeting of the Polk County
Taxpayers' league called for the court
house last Saturday afternoon to fur
ther consider the recall of the county
judge and county commissioners was
postponed indefinitely when an ad
journment was taken because of want
of a quorum, there being less than a
half dozen members of that organiza
tion present. The purpose of the
meeting was to provide funds for car
rying the movement to successful con"
summation, and to consider the ques
tion of eliminating the name of Judge
Teal from the petitions, leaving Com
missioners G. A. Wells and Clyde
Beckett, there being serious doubt
in the minds of the promoters pf
winning a victory at the polls in No
vember with his name included. !? .
When the houlr for the meeting ar
rived Messrs. J. K. Sears and F. !?,
Rogers, the latter president of the
County Farmers union, were practi
cally the only interested ones pres
ent, and after waiting a limited time
the little party separated with the
remark that the farmers were too
busy at this time to give the matfer
the consideration that it otherwise
would have had. It was steadfastly
maintained, however, that the under
taking would still be prosecuted; that
the petitions would be in circulation
within a short time, and that the
question of recalling at least two mem.
bers of the county court would be be
fore the people at the fall election.
The charges against the court are
extravagance and irregularities in the
expenditure of the people's money.
The Independence improvement, which
includes the removal of a steel bridge
and its replacement with a reinforced
concrete structure, the changing op a
fill which required the moving of ap
proximately 30,000 yards of earth.
ue -hard -smfaaiHg of -tlw ami.:
of highway on the Salem-Indepert;
dence road already macadamized, is
one of the petitions' important fea
tures, the promoters holding that the
betterment was a useless one at this
time, besides having irregularities
connected therewith. The weight' of
the movement rests upon Commission
er Beckett, and there are those who
arc. inclined to the belief that with
the elimination of Judge Teal and the
further fact that Commissioner Wells '
terra of office expires January 1, he
would become an easy victim. On the
other hand Mr. Beckett has many sup
porters, even aside from those who
are against the recall on general prin
ciples, and he is not worrying to any
extent regarding the undertaking.
From an unbiased standpoint, other
than being opposed to recalls general
ly, The Observer cannot believe that
the movement will meet with sufficient
support to enable those behind it to
secure the required number of names
to place the measure on the ballot in
November. Thus far it has met with
a cold reception from all except a
comparatively few.
"Great Scott, Woodrow!
WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
RAILROAD STRIKE WOULD NEC
ESSITATE OLD CONDITIONS.
John G. Brown From The Past Draws
Picture of Dallas If Trainmen
Walked Out.
Not, indeed, in this case, "the sad
dest of words, 'it might have been,' "
but the possible state of Dallas condi
tions if the railroad operating employ
es had struck, were described by John
G. Brown yesterday. Back, back, over
half a century, local history was ex
amined for the picture. Of the time
when Dallas consisted of buildings,
easily counted on the fingers of both
hands, Mr. Brown spoke. In those
days had roads connected Dallas with
Portland in the summer 'and no roads
were passable very far in the winter;
merchandise was freighted from Port
land in summer and shipped to Eola
or Independence in the winter and
thence transferred to Dallas; trans
portation figured in at the rate of a
cent a pound on all goods. W. C.
Brown, father of John G. Brown, own-
ed a general store and John Brown
drove the team or double team
to Portland for his father. J. W. Nes
mith had the postoffice, was county
clerk and ran a store. Postage was
charged if one couldn't pay for it on
receipt of letters or packages.
Though it was 53 years ago since
Mr. Brown freighted his last "twenty
hundred" from Portland, modern
freighting conditions with automobiles
and fine roads were not so very far
away with the prospect of a railroad
tie-up in evidence last week. And the
old freighters would have delighted
to have hitched up their span and gee
and hawed their way to Portland
again. Happily for the consumer it
probably would not have averaged a
cent a pound for transportation, but
here are some of the prices the folk
of a generation ago had to r y v
high. .
From an account bc k 3Tr. I
read these- prices, in i1 " 't in
1850's and 1860's:' r.,r :li"'li

90c. each; salt, $5 ft hundred; raw
linseed oil, $2.25 a hundred; syrup,
$7.50 five gallon keg; nails, 10c.
a pound; sugar, 20c. a pound; tooth
brush, 50c; paper of pins,. 12c;
spelling book (this came 'round the
Horn) 25c. "The spelling books to
day cost more than those of 50 years
ago notwithstanding the very much
greater cost of printing, paper, ink
and transportation then," said Mr.
Brown.
In the yellowed book an entry for
one coat, $15, purchased by J. S. Hol
man, father of Justice of the Peace
Hardy Holman, for Hardy was found,
"ft was Hardy's first fine coat," said
Mr. Brown, "and he certainly was
proud of it."

HARVEST GIVES BIG YIELDS.
Polk County and Nearby Territory
Showing Good Threshing Results
The harvest reports are bearing out
the pre-season optimistic feeling
about the crops, particularly the oats.
The late trains have helped the spring
oats and the winter oats sown in the
spring. Wheat is averaging about the
same as other years. Some of the
yields so far show high averages. Pric
es are holding up, wheat contracting
at $1.11 'and oats at 48 cents.
Seven threshing outfits are at work
around this neighborhood. W. E.
Martin is in Salt Creek; Russell and
Monday are operating in Gopher Val
ley and Bellevue; Earl Conner is in
the Ballston district; Thomas Mer
rick is around Harmony and Mill
Creek; T. J. Werth is at Grand
Ronde; Leslie, at Willamina; Brown
and Heider are close to Sheridan ;
Duerst Brothers are at Bellevue;
Schuman, Russell and McKinley are
in Gopher Valley; Adam Gutbrod is
near Sheridan; Casey Brothers in Go
pher Valley; and Pettyjohn and
Wooden are at Butler.
RAIN DETERS PICK!"'
rr? !
VL the rain will only make itself
conspicuous by its absence hop pick
ing in Polk county and vicinity will
begin today or tomorrow. Sunday was
a real day of prayer for the grow
ers and the thousands of pickers al
ready in camps around Dallas, Inde
pendence and other county towns.
Sunshine is what the grower and pick
er alike crave.
So far the rain has not damaged the
crop but it makes the picking and liv
ing conditions of the pickers very dis
agreeable . Overhead expense is high
for the grower or contractor and ev
ery day in which the vines are not
stripped represents an actual loss to
the management of the yards.
The price around Dallas is 40 cents
a box with one or two Kickreall yards
offering 50 cents. Most of the yards
here have more pickers than they need
though a few are still pinched for the
necessary labor. Among the local
yards which have scheduled their op
ening for tomorrow are Coad and
Grant's, Ah Coe's, and Brown's.
FRIENDS SHOWER WITH SHEARS
Orville Bntler of Monmouth Already
Hag Received Fifteen Fain.
Portland friends of Orville Butler,
prominent pioneer of Monmouth, Ore.,
think they have a good joke on him.
A few weeks ago Mr. Butler visited
his son, Dean, at Oak Orove, and as
sisted in clipping the wings of some
obstreperous chickens. When the task
was finished he pocketed the family
shears and carried them home to Mon
mouth. He was the target of many a good
natured jest as a result of his absent
mindedness, and on his birthday which
just passed Mr. Butler received 15
pairs of shears. The packages are
still coming in and each new one
brings a bright new pair of shears, he
wrote to Portland friends.
Thomas N. Bostwick Buried.
The funeral of Thomas Newton
Bostwick, the three-year-old son of
Mr. and Mrs. Oscar C. Bostwick of
north Dallas, was held from Chap
man's undertaking parlors Saturday
afternoon. Burial was in the Dall&f
eemeteiy.
Timber FaHer Injured.
Oliver Baker, a timber faller for
Scott Brothers of Blaek Rock, had his
foot badly erushe4 Wednesday at the
Scott Brothers' camp. No bones were
broken. Mr. Baker is at the Dallas
hospital. j
GGUNGIL TALKS QUARRY
FALLS CITY FATHERS TO DE
CIDE QUESTION TONIGHT.
Ordinance Prohibiting Card Playing
Read First Time Aseptic Tank
Nnimce Discussed.
The rock quarry question again
took most of the time of the council
last night. Tke report of City At
torney Coad of his discussions with
Falls City councilmen and with Mrs.
Esther Montgomery, over whose prop
erty the proposed right of way to the
quarry must go, formed the basis of
councilmanie comment. . A .contract,
drawn up by City Attorney Coad in
connection with the Falls City city
attorney, Walter L. Tooze, Jr., was
read by Mr. Coad. The contract was
considered a fair one by the council
men. It is understood that the Falls
City aldermen, unofficially, have said
the contract is fair and it is believed,
in meeting tonight, they will sign the
contract. The contract is an agree
ment to work the quarry together and
not to wilfully interfere with one
another, to permit the selling of rock
to a third party by either of the par
ties to the contract to a third party,
but at a ptrioe satisfactory to both
and the division of the profits of the
sale, and to provide for the opening
by either party, of a ledge of rock,
the expense of such opening to be
borne by the initiator but if the other
pany ro me agreement; ihkos advan
tage of the cleaning to get out rock,
the second party is to stand half of
the expense. The contract further
calls for the arbitration of any dis
putes which may arise in the joint
working of the quarry. The contract,

a lease to a right of way 30 feet
wide over the northeast corner ot
Block "D," Montgomery's Falls
City, provided the city of Dallas will
construct a cattle guard where the
right of way crosses the fence now on
the property and also promises not to
endanger the spring of water on the
premises. The opinion of the council
is favorable to the lease,
J. C. Hayter was reappointed a
member of the Library board for a
term of six years and Mrs. D. P. Pat
terson was named by the mayor to
succeed Conrad Stafrin on the board.
The council concurred in both ap
pointments. An ordinance to prohib
it the playing of cards in pool and
billiard rooms was read for the first
time. An ordinance - granting the
request of F. L. Shaw to clear title to
property bought from the town of
Dallas a number of years ago was
passed. In a verbal communication to
the councilmen Messrs. Butz and Vol
heim complained of the nuisance the
aseptio tank was causing. The ques.
tion was referred to City Engineel
Taylor for a report at the next meet-ting.
