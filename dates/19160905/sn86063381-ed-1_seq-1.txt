(United Press Staff Correspondent)
State Fair Grounds, Hamline,
Minn., Sept. 5.Minnesota is today
at war with herself.
It is a bloodless war of friendly
competition. Fourteen counties have
entered exhibits. Not a one of them
today would admit but that theirs is
Dest. Never before in the history
of the state fair has the competition
been so keen. Never before have so
many counties been represented. Ex
Titbits of the products of each county
grain, fruit, mineralsare shown.
Beltrami Exhibit Good.
& In the Northern Minnesota group,
"KgBeltrami and Crow Wing county
show up very well. Morrison also
has an interesting exhibit. Nicollet
county's exhibit from Southern Min
nesota is full of interesting and edu
cational features.
Standing alone among counties is
the claim of Beltrami that its potato
crop was not damaged by the hot
summer Throughout the rest of the
state there is a general complaint
that hot weather caused the plants to
go to top, and that the marketable
tuber showed up missing when the
spuds were dug
But these energetic boosters for
Beltrami countyB. M. Gile, agri
culturist, and Harry Winters, of the
ir,flrm
lV
of Reynolds & Winterclaim
Beltrami spuds will run 400 bushels
to the acre George Miller of this
county has 35 acres that will run 250
bushels to the acre, at least But
that's not all Beltrami county pro
duces The production of alfalfa in
the county has increased 300 per cent
this year alone, Mr Gile says
Mangel Exhibit.
"Now look at this exhibit of man-
gel," said Gile enthusiastically
Mangel, be it known, is not connected
with the laundry business. It's a
product that looks like a beet and
iH cattle take to it like a kiddy to a
circus He showed an exhibit of
mangel by August Jarchow "Now,
can you beat a proposition like this
a county where land is purchased for
$30 an acre, and where a man can
Taise cattle and all their food, too'"
The correspondent admitted he could
not, and moved on.
Schools Get Attention.
Those schools in Koochiching coun
ty are gaining a lot of merited pub
licity this week. There is an exhibit
from the rural and consolidated
schools, under the direction of George
Cochran of Little Fork. The schools
there are taking the consolidation
strong, he says, and it is working
Cochran pointed with pride to his
exhibit, which showed nine first
prizes. Essays on cattle got a first
and a second prize, while poultry
essays did as well The county cop
ped off one first on a flour essay
and away up in a country more fa
mous for lumbering There were
three first prizes for sewing exhibits.
John Berg, International Falls,
-and Joe Allard, Big Falls, were in
^charge of Koochiching county's ag
ncultural exhibit Grasses, grains
and fruit showed that this county can
make itself famous for more things
than having the longest name in the
state and producing the most print
paper in the state with all its present
high prices.
t,
Hospitality Strone.
Hospitality was the thing that
stood out strong in the Nicollet coun
ty exhibitbut that was by far not
all that Henry Robel had to show.
Robel is one of the best boosters in
the statefor Nicollet countybut
he is truthfully conservative about
it. He has been in charge of the ex
hibit of this county for many years.
He admits Mankato to be a regular
town, but recalls with pride that
North Mankato has the neutral ad
vantage of being in his county.
Corn down in Nicollet county is
running about sixty bushels to the
acre, he says. Potatoes are of excel
lent quality but not as plentiful as
last year. Grains are doing well, but
apples is where Nicollet county scores
a touchdown. The "wealthy" apple,
he says, is being raised in the ma
jority down there. These apples, he
claims, are very well adapted to the
county.
Building Material.
Building material forms a large
Tiart of the exhibit of this county,
-which is in the heart of the district
that furnishes 84 per cent of the
building material of the state, ex
clusive of wood. Sands and stone
from this productive section are
shown. Notable is the sand in an

SENATOR NELSON
ROASTS MEASURES
OF DEMOCRATS IN
SENATE ADDRESS
Minnesota Senator Gives Legislation
of the "Mule Party" a Warm
Grilling.
STRIKE ACTION IS HELD
UF AS "CROWING GLORY"
Tariff Law Destroys Protection and
Fails to Produce Revenue, He
Says.
Washington, Sept. 5."I cannot
omit referring to the greatest legis
lative glory of the Democratic party
this session in the passing of a law
to increase by legislative act the
wages of a certain class of railroad
employes 25 per cent over what they
are receiving now," said Senator
Knute Nelson with intense sarcasm
in a speech in the senate yesterday on
the legislative record of the adminis
tration. "This is the culmination of
Democratic wisdom in the field of
legislation.
Time Will Tell.
"Time will tell whether this bill
will be of any personal advantage to
those who held us by the throat and
threatened to strike, and whether it
will help democracy to secure the re
election of Woodrow Wilson. One
thing is certain, that if the increased
wages are sustained _gnd allowed it
will of necessity impose a great ad
ditional burden upon the farmers
and producers of the country. The
ultimate burden will fall upon them.
This is a piece of the so-called con
structive legislation of the Demo
cratic party."
Other Laws Reviewed.
Senator Nelson reviewed the tariff
and war revenue laws, the currency
legislation, the trade commission act,
the, Clayton act, the child labor law
and^-the ship purchase law.
"Th| avowed purpose of the tariff
law was to destroy protection and to
produce revenue," he said. "It was
successful as a destroyer of protection
but an utter failure as a revenue
provider.
"Like the Democratic tariff law of
1894, this Democratic tariff act of
1913 produced deficiency of reven-
ues."
The meeting of the Bemidji Town
ship Farmers club which was sched
uled to be held at the Jester Farm re
sort September 9, will be held in
stead at the farm home of A. O. Pad
dock, six miles south of Bemidji. The
Jester resort is crowded with sum
mer guests and would be unable to
accommodate the farm club.
