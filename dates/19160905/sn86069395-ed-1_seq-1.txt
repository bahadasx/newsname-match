All indications point to a clear track
for Judge C. H. Bush for circuit
judgj. Judge Jae. Breathitt, the
only Republican in the district who
could make a formidable race, has
declined to be a candidate and no op
position has developed in or out of
the Democratic party. Judge Bush
has issued an address to the voters
and expresses the hope that he will
be allowed to go ahead with his courts
without having to engage in a parti
san contest for the office he fills by
appointment. The general satisfac
tion that has followed his appoint
ment is shown by the fact that he is
so far without opposition from any
source.
ADDRESS 10 VOTtRS.
To the Voters of Christian county and
of the Third Judicial
District of
Kentucky:
As is well known to you, the office
of Circuit Judge in this district was,
on the 6th of 'August last, made va
cant by the sad death of Hon. J. T.
Hanbery.whohad presided with sig-
I1U1 ilUIUiy UUU uumcaa jui
over six
years.
His death necessitated the appoint
ment of a successor, and I was ap
pointed by the Governor to fill the
vacancy until after the next Novem
ber election. In a few hours afterre
ceiving notice of my appointment, I
went to Murray, Kentucky, receiving
my commission the next morning af
ter arriving there. I filed my com
mission, took the required oaths, and
immediately went to work on a full
docket. Have held the Calloway and
Lyon Circuit Courts, and go to Trigg
county next Monday. With but little
intermission I have been at work in
the faithful and -laborious service of
the people sinco my appointment.
As to the character of service I have
rendered, it is not becoming in me to
speak, but I can refer to the attor
neys, officers, jurors and others I. i
those couit where I have presided.
I so conducted the business as to put
the docket in good 'Condition, and I
think gave general satisfaction.
It was my nurooee to beacandi
date for the office subject to the action

President Wilson Goes After
the Republicans In
Accepting.
HEARD BY 8,000 PEOPLE
Notification Speech Made By
Senator OHie M. James,
of Kentucky.
The Republican party was charac
terized as a "practical and moral fail
ure" in the speech of President Wil
son accepting the Democratic nomi
nation Saturday at Shadow Lawn, the
summer White House. The President
was unsparing in his criticism of the
Republican party, defended his
foreign and Mexican policies, review
ed the achievements of his Adminis
tration and declared for "Big Amer
ica." Senator Ollie M. James, of
Kentucky, introduced the President
to a crowd of 8,C00 persons, who in
terrupted the President with applause
repeatedly during the course of his
address.
of the party authorities of the Demo
cratic party. The Democratic Execu
tive Committee of this district on the
25th of August, 1916, by its Chair
man, called a meeting to be held at
Eddyville the 29th of August, to take
some action in regard to nominating a
candidate for Circuit Judge.
Pursuant to that call the committee
met in the court house at Eddyville,
at the appointed time. Hon. Rainey
Wells and myself were the probable
candidates." He was called upon to
express his pleasure as to what meth-
od the committee would adopt to do-
f-w a v,,.u i
Whereupon Mr. Wells, in a most .able,
eloquent and patriotic speech, said
among other things that it was no
time for discord and party dissen
sions, and urged harmony, and stat
ed that he had concluded not to bell
candidate and expressed his willing
ness for the committee to nominate1
me, which, according to party law, it
had the power and right to do; and I,
being the only remainingaspirant, the
committee, in the exercise of its au
thority and power, nominated me and
awarded me the certificate of nomina
tion. And therefore I am before the dis
trict as the accredited nominee of the
Democratic party for Circuit Judge.
I have never held office before. I
have long cherished aspirations for
the office of Circuit Judge, and feel
that my experience and success as a
lawyer is a guaranty of my fitness for
the place. I have voted the Demo
cratic ticket ever since I was a voter;

I can before the election, but I can not

out and vote for me.
I don't know whether I will have

uninterruptedly with the courts, and
there is no reason why I should not be
allowed to serve out, the balance of

London, Sept. 4. A combined at
tack by French and British forces on
the Somme front Sunday resulted in
an important gain of ground between
the villages of Forestand Clery which
lie to the south of Combles and to the
east of Maurepas over an extent of
nearly four miles. These two places
were occupied by.the French while
the British captured a part of the
village of Ginchy and gained total
possession of Guillemont. Thus the
advance of the entente allies is clos
ing in on Combles which at present
is a powerfully fortified German
stronghold.
In the various attacks launched by
the British and French, upward of
3,000 prisoners were taken, together
with a large number of guns. The
artillery action, prior to the infantry
was of great intensity along the
Forest-Clery section while both
British and French inaugurated fur
ther attacks at various other points.
The German positions east of the
village of Fleury also were overrun
by the French who carried several
of the trenches and organized works.
The Germans returned to their at
tacks in the Verdun sector, sending
large forces of infantry against the

AlSlED

Woodrow Wilson and
Congress.
EIGHT-HOUR DAY JAN. 1
Commission To Investigate
The Question of Wages
Now.
Washington, Sept. 4. The threat
a general railroad strike, which hass
been hanging like a pall over tho
country for a month, was lifted Sat
urday night.
The Adamson Eight-hour Day Bill,
accepted by labor union officiars as
providing a satisfactory settlement o
the demands on which they based
their order calling a nation-wide rail
road strike for Monday, was passed
without an amendment by the Sen
ate by a vyte of 43 to 28. It was
signed by President Wilson Sunday
morning.
Shortly after the vote in the Senato
the brotherhood leaders in Washing
ton started out their code message or
dering the various general chairmen
to cancel the orders for a walkout at
7 o'clock Monday morning.
Lifting of the previously ordered
freight embargoes on the part of tho
railroads became general after tho
action in Washington. Managers of
the Western railroads announced that
there would be no precipitate court
action on their part to test the Adam
son law, but indicated that the matter
would eventually find its way into tho
courts.
The bill that stopped the strike pro
vides that after January 1, 1917, eight
hours shall be regarded as a basis of
reckoning for a day's pay of men en
gaged in the operation of railroad
trains in interstate commerce (except
ing roads less than 100 miles long and
electric lines), that they shall receive
pro rata pay for work in excess of
compensation shall not be changed
pending an investigation for from six
to nine months of the effect of the
eight-hour day upon the railroads by
a commission to be appointed by the
President.
Railroad officers have declared that
the action of Congress will cost them
$60,000,000 a year in increased wages
to the trainmen. Brotherhood offi
cials say the enactment will mean not
more than an annual increase of $20,
000,000. In Congress and among the
railroad officials there has existed
doubt as to the constitutionality of tho
lav, but what steps if any may be ta
ken to test this has not been indicated.'
