IN THE GUISE
OF "HUMANITY"
Tho railway brotherhoods and tho
president of the United States havo
put this thing over on the country
in the guise of establishing an eight
hour day.
This Is where they get tho gener
al human sympathy on their sldo.
This is the supremo deception In tho
wholo performance
The Issue la not and never waa a
question of shorter hours. It Is a
question of higher pay for the high
est paid labor in the world.
The difference Is as wldo as tho
sea.
Tho radical says that when the
rights of property come Into final
conlllct with the rights of Humanity,
property must give way.
It Is this appeal that has moved
mon from tho days of the abolish
ment of negro Blavery down to the
days of the abolishment of child la
bor. ,
It Is this appeal that is moving
men now to support tho president
when he declares tho establishment
of tho eight hour day to be In nccord.
with tho advancing opinion ot mankind.
Yet It Is not tho limitation of men s
work to eight hours which this rough
and ready decision means.
Tho proof of this lies in the fact
that tho brotherhoods thcmseltes
havo never said so, and that they
would not accept i real rulo making
them work eight hours per day, no
moro and no less.
It Is an lncroaso of wages that this
decision means-slraply mmo
of an imaginary lino in tho revision
of wnges upward.
Raising ot wages often has , U. Un
man appeal. In industries like that
ot garment making It often means
tho difference between a lifting of the
worker above tho line that divides
industrial slavery from Belt respect
Ing economic Independence.
In tho Present case the advance
does not havo that significance. Tho
50,000.000 advance or the ,100000,
000 advance goes to but one filth ot
io railroad employes. That one
Ottn is bo well paid that oven Oar
return ot the conductors' union said
recently that other worklngmen
Z M bo Prejudiced as arbitrators,
because they would be Jealous of the
hlgi wages, the brotherhoods already
I So getting. Ma" trainmen now
aro receiving higher pay than pro e
slonal men or than Important oxecu
two officers of tho road.
Tho president's decision, then, la
a verdict In favor of property nga nst
property; ot small proper against
big Property, to be sure, but never
tholcss. of property against property,
is not a verdict of humanity
against property, as It pretends to be.
Tho eight hour day Is not put Into
effect by It; a wngo advance for the
most highly paid class ot American

BETTING ON

was reported Sunday as follows:
In the election betting the longest
odds on Hughes wero 9 to 5. From
which they sank to C to 5. Now they
are 8 to 6. Support ot newspapers
with a following of a couple millions

it became plain that the Hearst pa
