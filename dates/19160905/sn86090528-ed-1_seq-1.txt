SAYS GOVERNMENT
OWNERSHIP CERTAIN
I Garctson Predicts Great Strides During
Next Ten Years in Government
Operation of Roads
By United Press.
Washington, Sunt. 5. The railroad
brotherhoods, though reasonably con
fident that the eight-hour bill which
has now become a law means a year
of peace, say there will be a strike if
the transportation chiefs ever try to
restore tho ten hour system. They
think tho railroads may test the con
stitutionality of the measure which
President Wilson signed Sunday but If
the courts deem It unconstitutional
and the roads try to revert to the ten
hour day the strike threat will be re
newed. In view of the positions tak
en by those who question the legality
of a bill signed on Sunday, the presi
dent will again sign the document to
day. Predicts Government Ownership.
Uy United rpss.
Washington, S.pt. 5. That govern

who was one of the central figures in
the recent strike situation. The avert
anee of the national railway-strike
through the interference of, the gov
ernment he believes to be only one of
a series of steps toward such an nd.
"Ten years hence you shall see a
mighty stride toward government own
ership and the operation of all rail
roads as well as other public utilities,"
he predicted. The sentiment in that
direction has grown steadily."

against 26 in June, which by every
known precedent should have taken
the lead.

again suprred to activity on September
first when four permits to marry
were granted.
Nor was tho spirit of matching con
fined to the first of the mohth. Dur
ing the first two days ten licenses
were Issued and the total was brought
up to thirteen by Monday noon.

LAWTON
In One Sided Game Sunday Blash Strikes
Out Thirteen Visitors and Game
Closes 8 to 1
(By Kilbourne.)
In a one-sided event at the ball park
Sunday afternoon, the locals swamp
ed the classy Lawton aggregation by
a score or 8 to l. There was never
a dull moment on tho locals' bench
whilo there was considerable "loaf-
in" around the visitors' side of the lot.
Credit for three of tho Lawton club's
five miscues must bo given to the
shortstop, Amspencer, who booted
thorn all around second base.
In the third inning Hunter, pitching
for the visitors, managed to (put one
over on tho homo bunch by making
the batter foul two and swing like a
rusty door at the third. Whilo Hun
ter whiffed only one batter Blash,
twirling for tho Chlckashas, had thir
teen Btrikeouts to his credit. Some
record for an amateur, eh?
Strong at the at.
During tho time the locals were
gathering ten hits and fattening their
batting averages the Lawton nine
managed by the hardest kind of try
ing to gather exactly half as many aud
very scattered they were, too.
Blass Stingy With Hits.
Blass was stingy with hits, allowing
no two to come in Immediate succes
sion, whilo at tho same time Hunter
was pounded all over the field for sin
gles and doubles, then doubles and
singles.
Tho loyal and faithful ones turned
out in fair numbers to see and help
their "old home town" boys wiu.
The visitors had a team which, un-
dor proper management, could be
come one of the fastest amateur base
ball aggregations in the state. But in
this they are lacking. But we should
not worry when we had only one of
the best iti the state In the box. How
are we going to pull through with a
guy in there who can only strike out
thirteen men, an errorless infield back
ing and several guys who couldn't hit
any better than .500 or .750 do for the
day?

The 1916-17 term lor moonlight
schools was inaugurated in Grady,
county yesteroay, Labor Day, when
tho
Alox school, one of the largest
and earliest in the state, opened its
session for its young and adults alika
who are unable to attend day school.
The school was organized with a
corps of able instructors under Super
intendent A. S. Hancock and will con
duct Its Bossiou three nights in tha
week.
This year the students at tho Ales
moonlight school will be divided into
three classes: Thoso who cannot"
read and write, men wko wish to pur-
sue school work farther than they,
have gone in the common schools, and
high school pupils who have gone to
work and are not attending day,
schools, day pupils not being penult
ted to attend the night schools.
Those pupils spond thirty minutes la

Superintendent Shepard stated 'oday
that last year 55 such schools wera
maintained in tho county with an en
rollment of 680 men and women. It
Is expected that fully 73 schoots. will

but a reality is shown by the fact tl at
people in tho country are now becom
ing intensely interested in the work.
The schools do not lack finances but
find tho moral support of a communi

schools not only confer a benefit on
those who take advantage of thain but
tend to create a greater local Interest

from communities opposition to edu
cational advancement which is often
offered by those who have not enjoyed
