most ;',erious hideousness, as Mark

such part of the la Mil and naval
forces of the I 'niiel stale as may
o iH-eess-ury" to retalUU against
foreign blacklisting and lxy-ttiiiir
in an ainemlment oted into the
emergviM-j i-eeiuie bill by tin sen
ate toda.
An adilitbmal weapon for ntal
iation t foreigni lyetts of Amer
ican trailing; was placed in the hands
of the president when the senate
adopted Sen. lMiclan's aniendnient
authorjing him to deny the use of
mails to foreign eonratioiis dis
criminating agrainst American mer
chants. Internat Uuial News Servi -:
WASHINGTON'. Sept. .". Pres
sure has been renewed on the. ad
ministration to force an tarly reply
from Creat Fritain on the malls and
boycott protests. Continuous prom
ises of immediate action have ben
disregarded and all of the informa
tion reaching the state iepartment
indicates that the boycott is being
made almost ironclad while the
mails delay shows stfady little m-
provement.
Now that the president has the
threatened railway strike off his
hands he is exepected to press
speedy action by Great Britain and
France. Since the initial boycott
protect was sent forward the state
department has been compiling
facts to make the rejoinder which
is certain to called out by the
F.ritish reply convincirg in tone.
In this connection the adminis
tration already is in possession of a
number of weapons which can be
used In retaliation. First, of course,
is the right given under the ship
ping bill to refuse clearances to ves
sels which have discriminated
against American shippers. The
revenue bill has attat hel to it a
retaliatory clause designed to reach
the Fritish-American Tdaeco Co.
ami concerns of that character
which are working to hold prices
down on the tobacco products of
this country. In addition the attor
ney general has specifically ruled
that there are certain clauses of the
anti-trust laws which are available
for prosecution where discriminathjn
against Americans can be shown.
With these weapons available the
administration is exptcted ti make
a si.ong effort t secure threjgh
diplomatic tin ans at b a-t a com
plete revision of the loviott lists of
Great P.ritain and France. In ad
dition the attorney general has
specifically ruled that there are cer
tain finises ' the anti-trust laws
which are available for prsecution
wh t discrimination against Amer
icans can be shown.
With these weapons available the
administration is expected to make
a stnutg effort to secure through
diplomatic means at least a com
plete revision 'f the boycott lists of
Great Britain ami Frmce. In ad
dition it is expected that when the
reply on the mails holdup i received
here it will I.e made the basis for a
new and different demand inasmuch
as information gathered by the
agents of the state department now
has shown urn lusi vely that in the
general confiscation put into effort
not alone Teutonic. but neutral
American owned documents of great
value have N en seized.
At his recent conferences with
