PEOPLE NEED ONLY
THOROUGH KING
ADVISES WATCHFUL CARE
Tillman Says "Threatened Disaster"
Should Make People
Alive to Duty of Citizenship.
Henjamin ltyan Tillman, senior
United States senator from Soutn
Carolina, said yesterday that he believed
the re-election of Gov. Richard
I. Manning next Tuesday was as
certain as the return of Woodrow
Wilson to the Presidency of the
United States this tall. The threatened
disaster, he said, had been
brought about by a reckless disregard
of duty on the part of a large
proportion of the electorate, and the
return of Gov. Manning to another
term could be accomplished only by
a thorough awakening of the people
and strenuous activity by citizens
in getting to the polls the 0
imio indifferent voters who remained
away the first primary. "The Lord
helps those who help themselves.*
was his crvntin onnr'i!oat????< ?f ?i.?
value of industrious, personal effort
durine: the interim of seven days
before the second primary. His advice
to all who favored pood government
was to po to the polls early,
remain there all day and work for
those who best represented the welfare
of the State, and to stand by
until the ballots were counted.
"Keep Primary Clean."
The anticipation of the charge of
fraud, Mr. Tillman expressed the
hope that all legal forms would be
complied with, "that there may be no
possible justification of a charge of
unfairness or illegality.'' "Whatever
may happen," he concluded, "1
should hate to see the integrity of
the primary challenged. And no
greater calamity could occur than
for money to be used."
Mr. Tillman is chairman of the
committee on naval affairs in the
United States senate and. upon the
completion of the session's program
of legislation, two weeks ago,
relative to the nation's military
power on the high seas, returned to
his home at Trenton, where he hatbeen
recuperating from his arduous
labors in Washington and is now
giving much attention to his farming
interests. From his corn crop
this vear he says he w"l harvest extraordinarily
large yields and his
cotton will produce an average crop.
Mr. Tillman fattens cattle each
winter, and the only commercial fertilizer
he used this year was acid
phosphate. This in connection with
the cow lot refuse is producing as
Kood cotton this year, he says, as
grown in previous years with 500 and
000 pounds of htgn grade guano to
the acre. Mr. Tillman says he will
harvest with the next few wajeks
enough silage from his peavine and
sorghum acreage to fatten another
herd of steers this winter. While in
Columbia yesterday Mr. Tillman was
the guest of his nephew, John E.
Swearingen. State superintendent of
education, on Blandinx street.

FIOCKJO BLEASE
SO SAYS THE AMERICAN
M. R. Cooper Advises Former
Candidate He Will Not Vote
For Manning.
Columbia, Sept. 4.?The real interest
in the political situation in
Columbia as reflected from various
parts of the State today centers in
the effect that it has become known
that a considerable number of
Blease people voted for Manning,
regarding htm as the weakest candidate,
in order to get him in a second
race, instead of Cooper, on the
assumption that Manning could not
win. in any event, and that a harder
fight would be necessary against
Cooper.
On August 24 the Columbia State,
the principal mouthpiece of the
Manning regime, said:
"A defeated candidate can nev?r
dispose of h?s votes as be wishes."
This is one of the few political
prophecies in which this journal has
ever been proven correct.
The Cooper vote is flocking to
i Rlease.
Hon. M. R. Cooper, former secveI
tary of state of South Carolina, has
written Solicitor Cooper a letter in
which is expressed the prevailing
sentiment among the supporters of
Mr. Cooper. Mr. M. R. Cooper
says:
Refuse to Support Cooper.
"We have supported you through
two campaigns, and regret to see you
sacrifice yourself to partisan ship.
We have stood by your policy and
platform, hut can't get on your new
j partisan plank. We will support,
? oie mease ror governor, because
we believe he Is the people's choice.
Now, a word as to partisanship. In
the campaign two years ago (Governor
Rlease had three competitors
for the senatorship: Messrs. Pollock
and Jennings hurling bitter sarcasm,
and. in one instance, bitter apithets
' at the governor, while 'Good Parmer'
Smith came quitely along on the
' farmers' wagon and gathered in the
sheaves. While Governor Manning
' from the gubernatorial platform
cried aloud. 'Down with Rleaseism,
while now confronted with Rlease
on the stump he rises above that
and falls back on his dignity, to say
1 this is inconsistent."
It is realized here that Former
Governor Rlease is going to be
elected by the largest majority evergiven
a gubernatorial candfflate in
the history of the State, and the desperation
of the Manning people is
shown by a first page article in the
Columbia State this morning which
quotes extensively from The Charleston
American's report of a statem
tin olvorr ah* Kw
uiv.ii rs i ?VI. UUV wj AVI . inranr,
which the Columbia State refused to
publish even as a political advertisement.
Makes "State" Wince.
"This proves that The American
has got under their hide," was the
general comment here today. "Why,
The Aimerican published the Cooper
statement backing Manning, on its
first page, because it was a matt"r
of news, and here the Columbia
State is replying to something in
The American which tht. Col dip hin
State refused as an advertisement.'
The predictions of the Colum la
J State with regard to the second pri!
mary attract no attention whatever

in a very convincing manner and wn<
listened to very attentively by the
convention.
Mr. W. H. Reed addressed the convention
on "The Practical Method.,
of Improving the Elementary

practical thought and called forth
many comments in the way he

lit to the convention.

and thoughtful remarks on "Let
Xach School and District Have a
I Definite Aim," after which the statistical
reports were called for and
