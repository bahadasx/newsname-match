REVENUE BILL PASSES SENATE.
Underwood Fails in Final Attack On
"Change of Principles" by Democrats.
Washington, Sept. 5.—The insurgent
movement, led by Senator Underwood,
of Alabama, against the democratic
caucus agreement on the emergency
revenue bill was defeated decisively
when the senate voted 43 to 7, to sus
tain the finance committee's amendment
to the dyestuffs tariff.
"Regular" democrats and all the re
publicans united In rolling up the over
whelming majority against the revolt.
The seven senators, all democrats, vot
ing against the committee amendment,
were Bankhead of Alabama, Bryan of
Florida, Lane of Oregon, Reed of Mis
souri, Underwood of Alabama, Over
man of North Carolina, and Viirdaman
of Mississippi.
Underwood in Final Attsck.
The vote was preceded by/a vigorous
assault by Senator Underwood against
the dyestuffs tariff, which he de
nounced as contrary to democratic
principles. Senators Hughes of New
Jersey and Siune of Missouri defended
the proposed tariff in order to build up
American competition to Gterm&n dye
stuffs after the war.
"The people of the United States,"
said Senator Underwood, '(repudiated
the republican party in 1910 and sent a
democratic house here, and you on the
republican side of this chamber know
the reason why they did it It was. be
cause you promised a revision of the
tariff downward In 1908. But what did
you do? You revised it upward, in
stead, and Increased the burden of tax
ation'on the people. Have you forgot
ten the lesson taught you then? If no
one else reminds the people of that fact,
I shall do so.

do no*, believe they did it because they
believed in It as principle, but be
cause they were yielding to temporary
pressure. Any party whioh surrenders
fundamental principles to the exigen
cies of the hour is courting defeat.
"This schedule deliberately proposes
to give special interests between $2,
000,000 and $3,000,000 a year. You will
not have any revenue from the dyestuffs
schedule after It passes. The present
law was raising $2,000,000 annually
from that schedule before the war.
Even republicans are saying they would
write a tariff law which would bring
tn revenue at the custom house and re
lieve the people of Internal taxation, but
this .schedule will not raise revenue.
Compared with It, schedule of the
Payne-Aldrich act must blush with
shame."

Washington, Sept. 5.—To the pro
posal of the entente allies that neu
trals accept the principle that all sub
marines are vessels of war the United
States has dispatched a reply which It
is understood, holds to the principle
that the characteristics of each Indi
vidual submersible must govern the
ise.
At the same time advices to some of
the diplomats here today announced
that Norway, Sweden and Spain had
forbidden their harbors to merchant
submarines on the ground that they
are "Indistinguishable from war craft."
The memorandum from the allies was
sent to all neutral powers.
The reply of the United States, It
was stated, was in the form of a me
morandum. and not a formal note.
To the contention in the allied me
morandum that It is difficult for war
ships to distinguish between armed and
morchant submarines the American re
ply points out that it is equally diffi
cult to distinguish sailing vessels with
masked batteries.
Japan Reassures United States.
Tokio. Japan. Sept. 1.—Japan has of

the alliance recently made by Russia
and Japan will not affect the status

The
Russo-Japanese
convention was
signed at Petrograd July 3. The Japa
nese foreign office In reply to a ques
tion from the Associated Press after
the treaty had been signed, as to what
effect the alliance would have on the

"The convention Is an emphasis on

integrity, of China, whose ."open door

American trade and interests are In no

NEW CRISIS IN CHINA.
United States Officials Keeping Close

Washington. Sept. 5.—Close watc.i
is being maintained by diplomatic of
ficials here over the newly-threatened
crisis between Japan and China grow
ing nut of the recent clash at Cheng
Chiatun. Considerable fear is felt that
the rights of the United States in
China may be affected in view of re-,
ports that Japan has made other de
mands than those published yesterday
In dispatches from Peking and that
the secret negotiations threaten (Chi
nese rule thruout Inner Mongolia.
An extension to inner Mongolia of
the authority gained by Japnn In south
Manchuria by the treaty of May *,
1915, involving supervision by Japan
of foreign loans and special privileges
for Japanese resident citizens, might
Impair seriously the open door policy
and the integrity of China, It was
pointed out here.
Washington Mystified.
No official report of the second clash
has been received by either Chinese,
Japanese or Washington officials. Tin
location of Chaoyangfu is fully 150
miles inside the border of Inner Mon
golia. No reason is known here wh
Japanese troops should have been
there.
It is thought significant, howeve:.
that Japan, not satisfied with the dis
missal of the Chinese involved, re
moval of the garrison and indemnifies
p.-itinn of the families of the seventeen
Japanese soldiers killed should also
press for political advantages.
WHEAT VALUES CLIMB.
Crop Estimates Cause Advances In
Some Cases of As Much As 6'/2 Cents.
Chicago. Sept. 5.—Heavy buying on
the part of large houses forced the
value of wheat today sharply higher.
In some cases the advances amounted
to 6% cents a bushel, the September
delivery touching $1.51%.
Altho the settlement of the railway
strike was partly responsible, attention
chiefly centered on a statement that the
condition of the domestic spring crop
at harvest was fhe lowest ever known.
According to another authority the
1916 crop In the. United States was 25,
000,000 bushels under bread and feed
requirements, and there was no surplus
