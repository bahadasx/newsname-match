FRENCH TAKE BIG
STEP TOWARD GOAL
Magnificent Victory Puts Them in Position to Strike Vital
Rlow at Peronne by Turning Foe's Tactics
of 1870 Against Him.
By FRED B. PITNEY.
II] Caj - ? T".e TTli'une ] I
Taris, Sept. 4. The French won a!
' magnir'icer.t and highly important vic- j
tory yesterday north of the Somme, and
I have reason to believe that last
' night's communiqu4% begin another
| series such as we had in the firat days
: of the great offensve.
The question whether the battle of
1 yesterday was the prelude to a vast
' Franco-British ofTensive ia one the
censor would not permit to be an
swered, but it is evident that the i
French (ieneral Staff would not bave
hegun that action evcrpt according to
eoBcerted Allied plaaa,
Weather conditions will be a most ,
important factor for the next fev/ weeks
in determining the nature of the com
muniques. In actions such as thore on
the Somme artillery is an arm without
which victory cnnnot be achieved. And
the artillery, working :n such huge
masses and with such minute attention
to detail. demands cleBr weather for
observation by 'h aviators. Bad
weather, with low-hanging clouds, will
stop an offeaaive far more effectively
than any eounter meaaurea aken by
the enemy.
(,iant Step Toward I'eronne.
Vesterday's action constitutes a 1
giant atep forward on the road envel

Strelliag in Van (ortlandt I'ark
was a rather precarious pastime jrea
tarday for ihort men wearing .lark
clothing and caps and having at hand
no proof of where they had been be?
tween 8 and 'J o'clock Sunday night.
At one time, a- Headquartera, the
Bronx detective branch and the Bronx
( oroner's Oftcfl pressed their search
for the rnurderer of Dwight P. Dil

persons in custody a faet signiticant
that the story told by Miss Mary
Mc.NiiT, only witness of the "Lover.s'
I.ane" flhootiag, was accepted as essrn
t.ally true.
One by one, their alibia aatsbliabad,
the nuspected men were rclea.sed.
Twenty-four hours after the inve.-tiga
tion was begun the last of them had
been freed and the police wetB where
they started.
There is little doubt Bt Headquarters
that the shooting was the work of
blackmailcr highwaymen, out to prey
on park spooners. For many years this
type of peity criminal has been fa.n
iar to the police. In the last few months
they seem to have been carrying on
their operations in something like an
organized way.

Van ("ortlandt rnrk, with its many
dark drives to attract motorists bour.d
for or rcturning from the surrounding
road houses, has been their stamping
ground.
The park police know of a half doz
en recent cases where spooners have
been levied upon. In theaa cases
eomplaintl have been made and speed
lly withdrawa when the complainants
were told they must make their names
and addresses of record before police
action could be taken. But a great ma
jonty of the victims, undoubtedly, pay
up and rall quits without even going
that far toward the apprehension of
the blackmailer*.
