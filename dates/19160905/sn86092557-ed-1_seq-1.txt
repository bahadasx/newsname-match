Board of Affairs Prepare Official
Notice For Prevention
of Epidemic
The order of the board of health
postponing the opening of the schools
until September 25, was confirmed this
morning at the Board of Affairs meeting
and an official notice prepared In
which all children are prohibited from
attending public gatherings such as at
picture shows, churches, theaters, family
reunions and picnics. This order
affects all children In the city under
16 years of age and is thought to be the
most practical method available for
the prevention of Infantile paralysis,
which has now spread from neighbor
lng states to nearby towns.
Seventh street, between Virginia
avenue and Chamberlain street, was
ordered paved by the Board and Finance
Commissioner Barnes and Street
Commissioner Lehman authorized to
pnrchase materials and to do the work.
Spence street, between Grafton and
Bennett streets, was also ordered
paved. Commissioner Lehman and Finance
Commissioner Barnes ordered
to purchase materials and to proceed
with the work.
Again Banquo's ghost presents Itself
in the form of the dog nuisance In the
city. For several years tbe city has
been trying to devise a scheme to do
away with stray dogs and to see that
all dogs which are kept In the city
are licensed. This work since July 1,
1918, has been In the hands of the Humane
Society which apparently has
been unable to handle the matter efficiently.
A comparison of the work
done during the first two months of
last year and the first two months of
this fiscal year are very discouraging.
To date, there bave been but 119 dogs
taxed. Last year on September 1
there had been 256 tagged and about
50 killed. None have been killed this
year. The Board passed an order requesting
a report from the Humane Society
as to what action it Intended In
handling the situation. It Is likely the
matter will be put In the hands of the
police again as complaints are coming
In from those who have paid tags and
from those who are annoyed by dogs
whlqh are untagged.
Concrete walks were ordered laid in
front of the property of the C. B. Car
uo/ iicna buu iu lruut oi me neming

nocence
(By B. J. O'DONNELL.)
MARLINTON, W. Va? Sept. 4.?
Jack, being Just an ordinary hound
dog, doesn't know all the facts In the
"human hangman's noose" murder
case, bnt he does know his master, Dr.
Oliver A. Howard, is in trouble and the
body of his mistress. Mrs. Howard, was
carried away in a black box covered
with flowers children gathered In (he
mountains.
Prior to the day his mistress was
found dead, her neck broken by wbat
physicians call the hangman knot
grip, and Dr. Howard was arrested and
charged with murder, Jack was the
happiest dog In the Allegheny mountains.
Today he Is the saddest.
Every afternoon. Just before the sun
sinks behind the mountain range, he
trots up the long road to PocahontaB
county Jail where. In dog language, he
tries to tell his master he is being
loyal.
Jack seems to understand that his
master's old friends deserted him after
he was arrested in connection with
this "Jlu Jitsu murder" alleged to have
occurred after Mrs. Howard returned
from a suffrage meeting which the doctor
Is said to have forbidden her to
attend.
Before the body of his mistress was
taken to her old home at Fincastle.
Vs., for burial, Jack's life was different
One day he would accompany his
mistress, called the "little mother of
Marlinton," up to the homes on the
mountainside where he played with
other dogs while the "little mother"
cheered the sick or sat with other
mothers who were expecting newcomers
into the world.
The next he would trot contentedly
behind the master's buggy when the
doctor went on calls.
When Summers Sharp, prosecuting
attorney, went to the Howard home
the day after the funeral he found
Jack huddled In the kitchen. Jack refused
to eat. He seemed to know
clouds hung heavy over his home.
Dr. Howard will be placed on trial
in November. Prosecuting Attorney
Sharp says he will call witnesses who
will testify that Dr. Howard boasted
he could "break one's neck in a twinkling"
and demonstrated a Jlu Jitsu
hold which consisted of placing the
thumb of the right hand over the
bridge of the nose and the fingers under
the left Jaw bone and Jerking the
head.
The twist in the "hangman knot
twist" described by surgeons, has the
same effect as a hangman's knot used
when a person is executed, breaking
the neck and causing immediate death.
Dr. Howard proclaims Innocence and
declares he will prove his claim that
he found his ^Ife suffering from a
narcotic.

Mrs. Yost
MORGANTOWN, W. Va., Sept 6.
?At tne state headquarters of tho
West Virginia Equal Suffrage Association
in this city, Mrs. Ellis A. Yost
chairman of the state campaign committee,
announced that the West Vlr
ginia organization had no connection
whatever with the Woman's Party, J
which recently conclnded a conven- .
tlon In Colorado Springs, Col., and
which endorsed a Presidential candidate
of one of the great parties. The
National American Woman Suffrage
Association, of which the West Virginia
organization is a part, is strictly
neutral as regards political parties.
Continuing Mrs. Yost said: "Our (
organization which is waging the bat- .
tie for the adoption of the amendment 1
to our state constitution, is composed 1
of members of all parties. Equal suf- <
frage has received the encomement of <
every party both in their state and
national platforms. We are receiving <
the support of members of all par- 1
ties, and, even though it were not con- i
trary to the policy of our organization, i
it would be sheer folly to break the 1
political neutrality rule of halt,a cen- I
tury. We have appealed to all parties
for support and are receiving it in i
generouB measures."
