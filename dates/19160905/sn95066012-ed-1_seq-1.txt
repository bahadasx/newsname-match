PRICE ONE CENT
After One More Week of Being Called Liars, Crooks, Tax Dodgers etc., The Senatorial Candidates Can Again Become Respectable Citizens
NO REASON FOR IT
When Bennington Citizens Show a
Way.
There can bo no reason why any
reader of this who suffers the tor
tures of an aching back, the annoy
ance of urinary disorders, the pains
and dangers of kidney ills will fail to
heed the words of a neighbor who
has found relief. Head what a Ben
nington citizen says:
Mrs. Celia Lamroeux, 222 Division
St., Bennington, says: "For four
years, I was so bad from kidney com
plaint that I could hardly do my house
work. I had a terrible backache and
headaches and sometimes became so
dizzy that I was nearly blinded. The
kidney secretions were unnatural and
caused annoyance. Seeing Doan's Kid
ney Pills recommended for such
troubles, I went to Cole's Drug Store
and got a box. They were just what
was noeded. The backache -that had
clung to me so long left and 1 felt
better and stronger. After taking two
boxes of Doan's Kidney Pills, all symp
toms of the trouble were removed."
The above statement was given De
cember 19, 1905 and after OVER FIVE
TEARS LATER, Mrs. Lamroeux said:
"Time only increases my confidence In
Doan's Kidney Pills. I still use them
occasionally, but never have any seri
ous kidney trouble, for they keep me
freo from it."
Price 60c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills tho same that
Mrs. Lamroeux has twice publicly
recommended. Foster.Milburn Co.,

TO THE PUBLIC!
In view of the serious effects of having any cases
of Infantile Paralysis in Bennington it seems im
portant that a more rigid quarantine should be
established. At present there are no funds avail
able for the Health Officer, either from the State
or the Town, for this purpose. A small sum was
given him by individuals, and temporarily there
ia an inspection of all trolley and New York
point cars and trains from Massachusetts. If
this is to be continued, there being no public
funds available, money must be raised by pnvate
subscription. Checks may be sent to the Benning
ton County Improvement Association, to the
order of the Association, or money may be left at
the Bennington County National Bank for this
purpose.

DEATH OF CHARLES EVANS
Former National League Pitcher Died
in Schenectady.
The funeral of Charles Kvans, bet
r known in baseball circles as
Chick" Kvans, was held Monday from
the home of his brother, Harry Kvans,
it North Pennington. He died at the
illis hospital in Schenectady where
he was taken July SO. For nearly u
,-eek preceding his death he had
been unconscious.
The young man, he was only 2(1
ears old, was the son of Albert Kvans
of North Pennington and was born in
the town of Arlington. His boyhood
is passed in the village of North
Pennington. It was while he was a
student at Purr and Burton seminary
that lie first attracted attention as a
baseball pitcher. During the seasons
that he played with the seminary
team the school was practically in-
Inolble on the diamond.
After leaving the seminary he
pitched for a season for the Hoosick
alls club and then went to Hartford
in what was then the Connecticut
league. He developed rapidly and
had a remarkable season, during
which he pitched a no-hit, no-run
game. Keats ol tins nature were not
so common in ll'lt) as in more recent
ears and Kvans was drafted by the
;oston National club. With Huston
he repeated his no-hit no-run porform-
ince in an exhibition game with the
Yonngslown. )., Icam. His arm failed
him during the 1912 season and he
was sent to the minor league, appear
ing with a number of teams. He nev-
r regained the cleverness that made
Mm one of the sensations of the base
ball world. At the end of two poor
seasons in the minors he retired from
the game. He had been employed pre
eding his final illness in the muni
tions department of the General Elec
tric company In Schenectady.

ing at their home on Mechanic street.
Her condition for several years lias

HELL HOLLOW OUTING
Green Mountain Club Labor Day
Hike
Another enjoyable day for the Green
Mountain Club passed into history
when the last ol the party of 27 meiu
oers and friends returned to the vil
lage early Monday evening after an
excursion over Trenor Meadows and
an afternoon sojourn at the club camp
at Hell Hollow. Two auto trucks pro
vided with seats well Riled with the
hikers left the corner of Main and
Valentine streets at H:1i and took the
parly to the old Woodford City road
just above Woodford Hollow.
About one third continued on to the
camp while the majority went on the
hike up the old rood to the meadows
where a half hour was taken u1 In en
joying the beautiful view and COOiing
breezes. The return trip was made
through the woods and some of the
bikers were surprised when they came
into the Barber camp clearing instead
of Jlell Hollow as was original plan
ned, but the "pilot' fully realized
from experience thai Hell Hollow was
rightly named ami that hikers, who
by the way, ranged in ng efrom sweet
sixteen to sixty-six. would have been
far later to lynch than they were If
the descent into the Hollow had been
attempted. As it was. lunches were
the first thought on nrriving at the
camp and It was not long before all
were busy engaued in the destruction
of the contents. Punch and hot cof
fee added greatly to the lunches.
A few returned to the village by au
to but nearly all walked down, some
going by way of the Long Trail to
BurgeSS clearing and eating nupper
at tho Y. M. C. A. camp.

ARTHUR P. S!C
AN EX-CLERK
Says Senator Page Demanded Part
of His Pay
"HFTY-FIFTY" WAS DIVISION
Page Reply Says Rich Is a Liar and
That He Got His Agreed on
Salary.
Rutland, Sept. f. According to an
affidavit by Arthur M. Rich printed by
the Rutland Herald Monday Senator
Carroll S. Page got Mr. Rich a job as
cleric of a committee at Washington
and hen compelled Rich to give up
half his salary to the senator.
't was a ruty-fifty deal according
to Rich. He got half the pay for do
ing the work and the senator got the
oilier half to help out on the high
cost 1 living.
Through Eft W. Lawrence, attorney
for the Rutland railroad, Senator Page
in this morning's Herald makes a re
ply claiming that Senator Page had an
allowance of $ 1 U per month to pay
for clerk hire for a committee and
that he hired Rich to do half the work
and that the other hall of the money
wont to pay Miss Seymour a stcno
giapher for the committee.
The faply to the Rich affidavit
say- be is a liar and is being used as
a tool by the Fletcher interests to try
to discredit Senator Page. It is
claimed that Rich was so well satis
ht 'i witli, his job that he asked for it
back again the next year "under the
same conditions."
The reply also Includes what pur-
l,orl8 M COPy of a letter to Rich
telling him just What he is to get and
the circumstances under which he is
hired. This letter was signed by W.
W. Bean who is now dead so that his
testimony is not available.
Rich in his .affidavit declares that
during the vacation of congress he
was compelled by Senator Pajfe to
sign an order transferring his salary
to Donald II. Scrlbner of Hyde Park
whoso wife is a niece of Senator I'age
and that Scribner supposedly got the
money and he got nothing.
Rich also alleges that Scribner was
on the iayroll as clerk of another com
mittee. but lived In Hyde Park and
did not even come to Washington ex
cept once on a visit Rich further de
i laics that nine-tenths of his work
was in connection with Senator Page's
private business and had nothing to
do with the committee with which ho
was supposed to be connected.
'I'd the Rich chnrges relativo to
Scribner and to being employed In the
Senator's private busine-s the re
ply made no answer except to
claim that It was within his moral
and legal rights to do as he did and
that it is customary lor members ot
congress to do the same.
