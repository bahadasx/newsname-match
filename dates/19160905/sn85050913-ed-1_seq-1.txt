SPOKTSMER RECEIVE
SOKWHAT OF SHOCK
Webster City Parties Held up by
Game Wardens on Federal
Migratory Bird Law.
Of the twenty-five or thirty sports
men who left this city Thursday or
early Friday morning for the lakes
in the northern part of the state
to be on hand at the first stroke of
the clock for wild ducks, snipe, and
other game, the majority returned
home Saturday having received
a good scare.
Rumor on the business streets is
to the effect that the entire number
bad been "pinched" for violation of
the federal law, which begins the mi
gratory bird open season Sept. 16th,
instead of Sept. 1st. A faithful In
vestigation failed to reveal that any
sportsmen out for ducks were taken
by the game wardens at the various
lakes, and it remains to be seen what
action will be taken in the cases. One
hunter from this city is reported to
have secured three ducks and to have
rowed into shore where he was met
with open arms "by the game ward
en, who Informed him that his ducks
would cost him just $300. This
makes a good story to tell, but wHl
probably never come true, as $100
apiece is the maximum penalty of
law in violation of the migratory
bird measure.
The actual situation regarding the
misunderstanding by sportsmen of
the law, is about as follows: Feder
al law exists, having gone into ef
fect quite recently, which prohibits
the shooting of any migratory bird
before Sept. 16th. The state hand
book of laws, a copy of which was
given to each hunter procuring a li
cense, from {he cotwjg^muditeir, ,glyes
the date for the opening of the hunt
ing season for migratory birds as
Sept. 1st. In the books is given a
skeleton of the federal law, but is
so confusing that a misunderstand
ing of the actual law is readily
gained from a cursory perusal of the
handbook.
The Associated press sent out dis
patches about a month ago of the
federal law and a copy of this ap
peared in the Freeman-Tribune
among the press dispatches. Many
failed to read it and with a hasty
glance into their handbooks loaded
their guns for Sept. 1st.
Some of the sportsmen, however,
were thoroughly scared and did not
even remain to shoot prairie chick
ens, for which game bird the season
is legally open.

UPSET
0. W. Roberts of This City Conveys
Injured Girl to Home in
Fort Dodge.
y. An automobile accident occured
Sunday afternoon on the road be
tween this city and Fort Dodge in
which a car containing two young
men and two young women turned
turtle and threw the occupants out.
But one of them—a young woman
who refused to give her name—was
badly Injured and G. W. Roberts and
party of this city, who happened
along Just after the accident, con
veyed the girl to the home of her
sister in Fort Dodge.
Mr. Roberts states that a consider
able crowd bad gathered about the
scene of the accident when he ar
rived, but that the occupants of the
car were very reticent about giv
ing any details as to the cause. The
car was upside down in the ditch and
the Joy riders were all alive, although
badly frightened and shaken. The
young lady whom they carried to Ft.
Dodge, said she was visiting her sis
ter in the Gypsum City and that her
home was elsewhere. It is prob
able that the young men out with
the machine had Invited the two
girls to go for a drive and that the
party were strangers to each other.
Energy will do anything that can
he done in this world and no talents
or no circumstances, no opportuni
ties will make a man without it.—

The car barn of the Fort Dodge,

ed to the ground Sunday about
7:30. The barn was a frame struc
ture about 50x100 feet in size and
the flames made short work of it.
No cars were in the building when
it went up in smoke. As there is no
fire protection in Gypsum and it is
quite a distance^rom Fort Dodge, no
firemen were on hand to try to save
it. It is not known' how the blaze
started. Some Webster Cfty parties
happened along in their autos just
as the flames burst forth from the
building and saw it go up in smoke.

Insurance Company Looking for Hen­

Hartford,, Conn., Aug. 3.—Free
man-Tribune, Webster City, Iowa.—
In 1912 the Connecticut Mutual
Life Insurance Company of Hartford
Issued a policy on the life of Henry
H. Roth, for the benefit of his fath
er, Jacob Roth, if he survives him.
At that time Henry H. Roth stated
his occupation as elevator opera
tor, Citizen's National bank build
ing and his residence as Des Moines.
The address of Mr. Roth has become
unknown to us, and we have made
inquiries without remit. As he
stated in his application that he was
born in Webster City, Iowa, It is our
thought that possibly there might
be some person in Webster City or
vicinity directly or indirectly in
terested, or others who might be able
to give us some assistance in locat
ing him, and by such means, perhaps
bring the company in touch with
Mr. Roth or some member of his
family.

i-t Our Rest Room.
Just one of the many instances of
what the rest room means to this
city occured Sunday when a wo
man and child from Peoria, HI.,
were stranded in this city without a
cent, having failed until late in the
day to find the friend^ whom they
were to visit.
One of the dray and transfer men
Wiilard Boughton—whoso heart
was touched, found the woman and
child with no place to go, and no
money. He called up Mrs. J. C.
Robison, matron of the rest room,
who many times has opened the room
on Sundays, although it is officially
closed upon that day. Mrs. Robison
at once opened the room for their
accommodation.
The woman had foolishly started
from home with just enough money
for her ticket and not a penny over.
She was not even absolutely sure
what family she was to visit here,
having also friends In Ellsworth.
She confused the names of the two
parties—the one 'in Ellsworth and
the one in this city—and naturally
no one was able to help her out un
til she overcame her nervousness
and was able to recall the name.
Sunday ailso two young girls
looking for work were directed to
the matron of the rest room and aside
from that room, knew no other rest
ing place In the city. Instances of
this kind occur every week in Web
ster City and on one can better ap
preciate the fact than those who go
to the rest room every day.
$55 a month weighed against the
actual service to humanity render
ed by the existence of such a room
with a capable matron in chargc.
shows the scales heavily weighted
to the humanity side. However, un
less something tangible Is done this
month, this city will lose her rest
room.-

PAVI6C0NTRACTS
Will Make The Contractors Pay for
The Expensfe That the City
Has Had to Meet.
Sac City, Sept. 4.—The city coun
cil at an exclusive session this morn
ing voted to cancel the contracts held
by the MacVlker & Burrows Paving
company, of Des Moines, for the re
paving of Douglas and Nebraska
streets from Fourth to Sixth street,
and Pierce street, from Fourth to
Sixth streets.
The council also voted to hold the
paving company liable for the cost of
advertising for the paving and for
the repairs made to the streets while
waiting fop the company to repave
them. The city attorney was In
structed to prepare the claims for
damages.
Since the council canceled the con
tracts, it is probable that the streets
will not be repaved this year. The
question of paving the streets with
concrete was discussed by the coun
cil members and Councilman Ward
asserted that he was in favor of
this.
The contracts held by MacVlcar
& Burrows called for the completion
of the paving by August 15. The
same firm paved Fifth street and the
council has refused to accept the pav
ing until many repairs are made. It
Is believed that the Des Moines pav
ing firm failed to carry out the con
tracts -because the council refused
the Fifth street work.
The newspapers of Cedar Rapids
have succumbed to the inevitable
and boosted the price of subscription

While working in the flour room
at Crandall's Model grocery a day or

tim of an accident which might have
been fatal. Mr. Wilson was stand
ing by a tier of flour when about
three hundred sacks fell over knock
ing him against another lot of flour
piled high on the other side of the
room. The flour fell with such
force that a table piled with corn
meal, graham, etc., was forced
through the floor, the four legs go
ing through the sheet iron flooring
and into the heavy wood flooring be
neath. If it had not been for the
other tier of flour, Mr. Wilson would
no doubt have been buried beneath
the flour and crushed to death. How
ever, he was lucky enough to es
cape with an injury to his right
ankle. The attending physician
cannot tell yet whether the injury
Is a sprain or whether the ligaments
are torn, the injured member is so
badly swollen.

City.
A large Reo truck belonging to the
Fort Dodge Wholesale Grocery com
pany was In the city Saturday deliv

reason for adopting this means of de
livery is because of the large amount
of freight on hand at the depots in
Fort Dodge which must be shipped
out before Monday. There were
13,600 pounds of groceries in the
load.
Big Check for Corn.

it is about the most that has been

W. ALORO DRAWS
I1IRTY DAYS IN JAI
Man Who Stabbed J. B.' Ray Oets
Off With Light Penally.—
Must Leave State.
A preliminary hearing was held
at the office of Justice G. F. Tucker
Saturday afternoon for H. W. Albro,
who was charged with assault with
intent to kill upon the person of
J. B. Ray, after a stabbing affray
which took place in the alley back
of the Crandall & Co., grocery store
three weeks ago.
Albro is only one of several names
by which the accused man is known,
?ut seems to have been' th^'last one
assumed by him. J. M. Blake ap
peared for the defense and the out
come of the hearing ttas an agree
ment between the state and the de
fendant that if he would plead guil
ty to "assault and battery" he would
be given a sentence adequate to the
plea and the charge changed from
"assault with intent to kill."
He did so and was sentenced to 30
days in the county jail, after which
he will be sent out of the state. This
after careful deliberation and inves
tigation seems to be the best way to
settle the disgraceful affair,
The stabbing affray wasj one in
which at least three men seem to
have divided the honors betweefl
themselves for cutting and stabbing,
all having been armed with knives.
As the melee took place in the dark,
an accurate account of the scrap is
impossible to obtain and already the
man who was the worst Injured—J.
B. Ray—has been sent back to the
state he claims as his home.

OH HISJMY NORTH
Something of Interest Concerning
Former Well Known Webster
City Preacher.
Brownsville, Tex., Sept. 4.—Maj.
E. S. Johnson of Sioux City, Metho
dist bishop and chaplain of the Sec
ond Iowa infantry, has gone to
his home, where he will spend a few
days preparatory to taking a trip
through Wyoming, Oregon and In
diana. He will attend Methodist
conferences in the states just men
tioned.
A thirty days' leave of absence
has been granted the bishop. At
the end of that time, probabilities
are that his resignation, tendered
recently, will have gone into effect.
He will then take a trip to Africa
to take up duties as missionary bls
hop.
At the present time the chaplain,
is the only national guard preacher
who has the honor of holding office
with the rank of major, In the whole
United States. There are only five
chaplains with such rank in the
regular army.
When the call for volunteers came
in April 1898, Rev. Mr. Johnson
gave up his church duties and enlist
ed, being appointed chaplain of the
Fifty-second Iowa, with a rank of
captain. Throughout the long
months spent at Chickamaugua, the
major administered to the sick and
comforted the homesick. The spirit
ual life of the men was well taken jj
care of by Captain Johnston. When
the Spanish-American war was over
and the troops sent back home, the jji |j
chaplain decided to stay with the -I
guard and in the reorganization, held t.jC .1
his position and rank. In 1908 he
was giveu the raak of major, because
of his 1898 service.
Only a few months ago, when the
guard was called out, Major John
ston, who had been elected mission
ary bishop to Africa by the Metho
dists and who had tendered his resig
nation, decided that if there was to
be action, hit: place was with the
regiment. He wired the command
ing officer to recall the resignation,
which was done. A leave of absence
was procured from the church au
thorities, which is now about at an
end.
A Sad Farting.
One of the saddest funerals ever
held in the vicinity of Kamrar was
Friday afternoon when Mrs. Dick
Gray laid to rest her husband and
only baby in the cemetery in the
German Presbyterian churchyard,
east of that village. Dick Gray pass
ed away Wednesday morning and on
Friday morning the baby, Dorothy,
about five months old, died of con
vulsions. The child had not before
been ill. The father and daughter
were buried in the same coffin. Mrs.
Gray was formerly Miss Bina Klaver,
a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Phillip
Klaver, of Kamrar.
Miss Irene Maywald has accepted
the position in J. C. Smith's transfer
office made vacant by the resigna
tion of Mrs. A. B. Mlkesell.
We are showing some Caps of Special
