LITTLE GIRL LEARNS TO SWIM WITH
WATER-WINGS ON HER "STUMMICK"
This morning, on my way to work, I found the Madison car
full to overflowing of very young men and very young women,
some of whom were complemented by a parent, and others of
whom were totally unattached, and all of whom scrambled from
the car at Seventh ave. and surged up the steps of the Central
school.
About 9:30 a. m. I entered the Central school myself. It had
that age-old school smell about the halls — you remember, you
grown up boys and girls, the mingling of new varnish and floor
oil with a dash of disinfectant.
Just within the door there was a line of mothers. The dads
seemed not to have waited around, but the mothers had. 1
noticed in passing that they were tired-looking mothers — the
tired look that comes from the vision of unwashed breakfast
dishes in the kitchen sink.
I went Into room No. 5. where
the bulletin announced that Second
graders were to congregate There
must have been 10 In that room, all
seated, with more or less orderli
ness. In the newly varnished little
ocats What I saw from my cor

Humphrey Smoked Out
Humphrey today, by 1: s own words, proves
that he did have something to do with the pur
chase of the infamous duck-pond site. His state
ment, printed in his standpat organ today as a de
tense, proves that he lied in his statement to that
same organ last November, when he said, "I never
had anything to do with the purchase of the site.
In fact. I always have refused to take any part in
negotiations having to do with the spending of
government money for sites within my district.
I refused to take any part in this and there is not
one thing to show that I interested myself in it in
any way, nor did I."
To that extent, Humphrey, the bluffer, has
been smoked out. Nine months ago he publicly
declared. "I refused to take any part in this, and
there is not one thing to show that I interested my
self in it in any way, nor did I." Today, caught
in a tangle of false statements, he himself brands
this particular one as a plain lie. Humphrey should
go on now and make a clean breast of the whole
thing. He should admit that he wrote another let
ter to the treasury department, marked, "confi
dential." in October, iQtO, to months before he
wrote the letter which he publicly admits having
written today.
Humphrey tries to cover up his tracks in this
mess Unlay by bluffing again about his SI,OOO for
feit. He says he has turned the St.OOo forfeit
check over to his campaign manager. Wonder if
he thinks this will fool anybody in Seattle? Hum
phrey is dodging a public investigation of his
record and he is still holding on to that *1,000 for

My Dear Mr. Bailey:
Since talking with you I have
received several communica
tlona from people living in Se
attle with reference to the pur
chase of a site for a public post
office station in Seattle. I am
satisfied that the price asked by
the owners of the property that
has been recommended for pur
chase IS A REASONABLE ONE,
but should you still think to the
contrary, I wish that you would
commence condemnation pro
ceedings at once I want here
also to reiterate what I said to
you the other day, that the let
ter which you have, giving the
opinion of certain bankers as to
the value of this property, Itself
shows that the price asked IS
A REASONABLE ONE. I be
lieve that any jury would return
a verdict on the statement made

After denying for a year that lie had anything to
do with the purchase of the postoffice "duck-pond"

man W ill E. Humphrey has at last been partially
"smoked" out and he admits today that lie wrote the
above letter.
This letter—now fully admitted by Humphrey
thru his campaign manager, Judge Hiram li. Hadley—
was written months before the deal went thru. It was
written to Bob Bailey, a dose friend ot Humphrey's
and was marked "confidential."

FORCED CHECK
LEADS TO FEAR
OF DIG LOSSES
Investigation of alleged
padding of payrolls for
county road construction
in one of the South dis
tricts, which may uncover
extensive operations ex
tending over a period ot
years, and reveal large pec
ulations, was begun Tues
day under orders from
Prosecutor Lundin to Dep
uty Carmody.
Discovery of what
seems to be evidence of
forced names of road
workers on the payrolls
came to last week,
when the National Bank of
Commerce directed Burns
detectives to investigate
the forged signature on a
county warrant for $36,
cashed there July 27, and
made out to John Johnson,
employed on road con~
struction in the Third dis
trict.
Johnson was the victim
of the forgery and doesn't
figure in any other way in
the investigation.
Hums detectives, in going over
district pay rolls In the county
auditor's office, discovered what
they have told Carmody was a
marked similarity between a num
ber of signatures. Indicating that
fictitious names had been entered
on the payrolls.
"J'a" Prove Clue
A similar twist in many capltol
"J's" in signatures on pay warrant
receipts was apparent, they pointed
out.
Names of some of the men. be
lieved to be dummies, were taken,
and an effort made to locate them.
An exhaustive Investigation »as
mnde In the vicinity of Kpnt and
O'Brien, bu* the aliened road work
ers could not b» found.
"I hsve turned the Investigation
over to Deputy Prosecutor Car
mody." Prosecutor I/undln said
Tuesday. "The auditor's office ia
co-operating, and has promised to
turn over all the payrolls and re
turned warrants.
Not in a Hurry
"Carmody 's tied tip In court to
day, and It tnav be several days be
tore we can get into this matter."
It is knovn that thp payrolls, hp
llpved to havp bepn paddpd, carry
h« many ns !> names some month*,
and that warrants w<>rp mailed to
(til who «erc supposed to have been
at work.
Some of the same names appear
month after month, and In many
rases Dip signature of the name ai
lpgpd "worker" is radically differ
pnt.
Lundin Questions "Boss"
It has not been definitely deter
mined who forged the name on the
John Johnson warrant at the bank,
nltho a bank clerk watched It
done.
I.uudin raid a road boss has been
brought Ih fore him, questioned,
and samples of his handwriting
tnken.
"The hank clerk refuses to sign
the complaint positively naming
this man as the fellow who signed
the Johnson warrant," says Ijtin*
din.
As there was a "John" Johnson
ntid a .lames" Johnson on the
pav rolls, it Is believe?! that tha
warrants were mixed bv mistake.
A "John Johnson actually worked
on the ro:»d Ran*, and it was his
kick at not receiving his warrant
that started the Investigation.
It Is possible, according to em
ployes at the auditor's office, that
the alleged forgeries may have
been "slipi ed ovc" for a period
of more than throe years.
other judges to take their places.
Nor has he submitted a written
agreement to withdraw from the
race, as he had promised.
If any more time is killed, Hum
phrey will probably accomplish his
evident purpose not to permit the
matter to come to a public hearing.
