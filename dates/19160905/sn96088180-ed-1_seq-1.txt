THROUGH
TIE SIDE OF
lulsvllle, Ky., Sept. 5. Only the
usual railroad station crowd was on
hand here today when Charles G.
Hughes' car was backed in. There
were no cheers or other stgna of en
thusiasm. The candidate Is en route
to Lexington, Ky., where he will
speak today.
A. T. Hert, In charge of the west
ern headquarters of the national re
publican committee, got aboard for a
conference with the nominee and the
two remained together In Hughes'
private car during the halt hour wait
here.
Hughes and Mrs. Hughes. went to
the atatlon platform to pose smiling
ly for a local photographer and to
take a morning stroll.
' It became known today that the
nominee is planning to address men
or the Plttttshurg, N. Y camp, If this
can be arranged. A tentative sche
dule, already mopped out for him, in
cludes a visit to the preparedness
camp September 12, making Hughes'
return to New York one day lator
than had been originally planned.
Before the candidate's cor left the
station a band straggled Into the train
shed and by playing southern melo
dies evoked applause, In which was
blended cheers for Hughes. . y
The original plan had been for
Hughes to make a train speech, but
apparently this Idea was abandoned
East of Gcillemont, Captur
the Report From
Paris, Sept. 5. The Germans last
night made several unsuccessful at
tempts to recapture ground lost to
the French on both sides of the
Somme in the allied drive on Sun
day and Monday. It was officially an
nounced today.
France's new 40 centimeter guns
played an Important role In the new
gains, according to dispatches from
the front today. The existence of
these guns waa kept secret for many
weeks. It Is believed It will work
more wonders In the closing days of
the war than did the German 42
centimeters that battered in the Bel
gian and French forts.
Since the beginning of the allied
offensive on July 1 the French and
British have captured twenty-nine
villages which the Germans feed or
ganised to the highest defensive de
gree. They have taken about 41,000
prisoners, 150 cannon and several
hundred machine guns.
The strongest German counter
attack was delivered north of the
Sonime, between Comblea and Forest.
The French had observed prepara
tions for this blow throughout yes
terday and were fully prepared to
meet It. The first men to attack fell
under French fire and the survivors
were driven back to their trenches.
South of the Somme the Germans
made several unsuccessful attacks
near Belloy-en-San Terre. the French
taking 100 prisoners.
Bad weather hindered development
lof the French offensive, but the night
waa spent in organising the newly
won ground against German counter
attacks. On the northeastern front of Ver
dun the night was generally calm, the
French taking fifty prisoners In local
encounters. Southeast of Thlaumont
a small German attack failed.

because a crowd was missing. The
candidate did not show himself for
some time and no one at the station
seemed to care whether he did or not.
The republican nominee was a dif
ferent person than the man who a
little over four weeks ago started off
on a transcontinental campaign trip.
Probably no public speaker, let alone
a presidential candidate, ever under
went such an experience as Hughes
did at the Ryman auditorium in Nash
ville last night. He faced an audi
ence that was "packed" against him,
and distinctly unfavorable to his
views. The crowd started a Wilson
demonstration. They hissed and
hooted the G. O. P. nominee. Hughes,
fighting mad at the Insult which he
considered hod been given Mrs.
Hughes, who was present on the plat
form with 'him, simply struck out
straight from the shoulder and ram
med home his bitter criticism of the
democratic administration with a new
line of hot shot. ' ' ,
He attacked the strike settlement
recently achieved by President Wil
son and had the satisfaction of hear
ing cheers and applause from the
southerners for his fighting spirit and
his determination to fight It out.
Naturally the candidate was in
good humor today, and the stimulus
of the night's meeting still stood with

BRITISH EXPECT 18
MONTHS MORE OF WAR
Geneva, Sept 5. British govern
ment officials have Informed the
Italian prime minister of their belief
that the war will last at least another
18 months, according to Rome ad
Tlces today.
ON WESTERN FRONT
Paris, Sept. 5 Field Marshal von
Hlndenburg has arrived on the west
front for the first time since the be
ginning of the war and Is urging his
commanders to a more stubborn de
fense along the Somme, the Echo de
Paris etated today.
The "old man of Mazurian lakes"
witnessed the retreat of the German
armies under smashing British and
French blows In Sunday and Mon
day's fighting. It was the first great
battle in which Jhe Teutons have
been engaged since Hlndenburg was
appointed chief of the German gen
eral staff.
The whole Somme battle front has
suddenly burst into activity, with
furious infantry fighting and some
of the most terrific shell blastings
since the Anglo-French offensive be
gan. The Germans are fighting des
perately, but In the past 48 hours
have been pushed steadily eastward
by Impetuous French attacks.
General Pooh struck south of the
Somme yesterday, while the . main
body of Teuton reserves waa prepar
ing to resist another great blow north
of the river. The Ftench successes
in this new drive equalled the gains
made north of the river on the pre
ceding day. Soyecourt has been cap
tured by a storming attack, and ex
tending their gains to the south, the
French occupied the village of Chilly.
The outskirts of three other villages
were seized and about three thousand
prisoners were taken.
While this great battle was going
on south of the Somme, the Germans
continued their preparations for a
counter-attack against positions cap
tured by the French and British In
Sunday's fighting north of the river.
The heaviest German blows are ex
pected to fall In the region of
Chaulnes, where the French gains

BkcUistcg Order
Washington, Sept 5. With the
allied diplomats in Washington pro
testing against retaliatory legislation
already enacted by congress to offset
the British blacklist, the senate to
day struck two more Mmi.
Amendments adopted to the rev
enue bill, are likely, some officials
believe, to result In official objections
taking the place 2 'of the private,
though positive ' protests against re
taliation whioh certain diplomat
here have voiced.
The first act today was passage of
Senator Thomas' amendment to the
revenue bill empowering the president
to retaliate agaiut any belligerent
commerce ship that discriminates
against American shippers and ex
porters. -V, y-
The second was adoption of Sen
ator Phelan'a amendment to the same
measure, refusing ' rights of the '
United States malls or the facilities
of any interstate express company or
of any wireless, telegraph or cable
company to the citizens of belliger
ent countries which discriminate
against Americans.
Both amendments explicitly em
power the president to take these
steps "Whenever during existence of
a war In which the United States la
not engaged the president shall be
satisfied there is reasonable ground
to believe" belligerent governments
have denied all lawful rights to all
American citizens. '
Violations of both proposed laws
are punishable by fines of $10,000 or.
two years Imprisonment, or both.
Both admittedly are retaliatory mea
sures against Great Britain's black
list and seizure and detention of
mails.
Thomas' amendment was drawn
with the approval of the state depart
ment and President Wilson Is em
powered by its terms to use "any part
of the land and naval forces he deems
necessary" to uphold It.
SOUTHERN STATES'
GREET PRESIDENT
On Board the President's Special.
Huntington, W. Va., Sept. 5. ."These
bave been the finest receptions I ever
have received." President Wilson to
day characterized his trip through
West Virginia and Kentucky. The
president evidently waa delighted at.
the enthusiasm with which he waa
received even when, late at night,
there was nothing for small
town crowds to cheer but the darken
ed private car.
The president's Journey into Ken
tucky, while characterized as non
political, has proved gratifying to his
political aides. At every polnt en
route crowds met htm with bands and
cheers at stations. In many instances
they waited until after midnight for
a view of the presidential train. Even
though they did not see the president,
they cheered loudly enough to awaken
every one on the train.
Thursday night the president leaves ,
tor Atlantto City, where he will ad-
dress the convention of the National
Women's Suffrage association.' Sat
urday he expects to motor to Long
Branch.
