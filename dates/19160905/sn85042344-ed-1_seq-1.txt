As the ong Rounded at the close

Several moments as if undecided. He
tnen reached out hoth hands toward
the hoxers and many of the specta
tors believed he wait ahout to awara
n draw. Suddenly Welsh rushed over
1o Itoche and placed his glove In the
referee's hand and It '.as raised aloft
while the official appeared to be
reaching for White. Tin next instant
jiiMlant friends of the ciiamploi.
swarmed into the linr.
An unfortunate, accident and un
plcisant incident marrc.1 the begin
ning .mi end of tho day s program.
tVhort I v before 2 o'clock a portion of
the bleachers on tho fouth side of
the Plena collapsed. More than .1
hundred persons were more or less
perioiiKlv Inlured.
When Referee Rjrhe announced his
deel ion tn favor of Welsh, tha.
ehaPers" "-'s udherenla appeared for
he moment spellbound. Then began
a fusillade of hundredc of cushions
Ahii h uera hurled from all direc
tions at the referee. Ho was rushed
through the crowd by friends to a
waiting automobile. Guarded by a
policeman the vehicle war speeded up
an unfrequented road to the hotel
while hundreds of nun and boys
rushed after It until outdistanced.
From a spectacular standpoint the
battle was considered one of the
poorest that has ever been fought
for the hlahest ring honors In the
lightweight division. I-or fully two
thirds of the time the fighters were
locked In a succession of clinches and
puHhlnr each other hack and forth
ahout the ring. Ft r this, many spec
tators held Welsh was largely to
Maine. Throughout the entire twenty
rounds scarcely a blow was struck
S' each man that did any damage.
Of the blows exchanged White's car
ried the greater punitl.e power, while
WelKh frequently wis cn the. aggres
sive and did his share of the leading,
It was noticeable that mnny of his
blows fell short and failed to reach
their mark. Rocha stated after tho
fight that he awarded Welsh the deot
sion for the reason that he did most
of the leading. With consummate
generalship Welsh throughout purctl
caUv nil the fightine, worked with
his back to the sun, fur ing White to
face Ihe hot glare. Neither, man drew
1 lood from his opponent and neither
i ho wed any partlcuhr evidence of
having boon In a championship battle.
Welsh fought carefnl'y and took no
chances wllh his oppv.ient's famous
left hand. On sei-eral Decisions when
it appeared likely that It might land,
the champion was ha king away so
that the force of the blows were spent
when th'v reached him.
ROUND 1 Welsh led twice with
left to head and they went into a
clinch. A series of clinches followed
without any blows being struck. White
landed left to head. W hlto sent right

ROl'ND 3 They ran Into a clinch
and wrestled about the ring. White
sent tight and left hooks to bodv and
repeated as Welsh missed left to head.
Few clean blows were struck, Itoche
being kept busy prying tho men apart,

Armed Poliecutcn Herded Rioters
Alieail of Cars; All Saloons
Closed.
EL I'ASO, Sept. 4. Rioting, an
outgrowth of a strike of street rail
way trainmen In progress here, fol
lowed a Labor day parade today. The
rioters attacked several street cars
being operated by strikebreakers In
the downtown streets, wrecked the
cars and beut the trainmen. A dozen
persons were arrested on charge of
Inciting riot and it Is estimated that
at least fifty persons were Injured In
the street fighting. Ill feeling be
tween strikers and operatives who
took their pluces when the strike was
culled two months ago manifested on
several occasions recently, reached a
climax today In it fist fight on a
downtown street between a striker
and an employe of the street railway
company. The general disturbance
followed.
For a time it seemed as though the
municipal police, reinforced by a de
tachment of Texas rangers, would be
powerless to quell the mobs. Flnully
after several hours of disturbance oil
which rioting took place on almost
all of the business streets. In which
street railway trafflo had been sus
pended, the mobs dispersed. When
traffic was resumed a policeman
armed with pistols and a shotgun and
ordered to shoot anyone Interfering
with the cars was detailed to protect
each crew.
Meanwhile all saloons In the city
were closed until further notice and
military authorities ordered all sol
diers stationed In this dial ret to their
camps. Tonight the provost guard
patrolling the streets was strength
ened and several companies of In
fantry were kept In reserve to pre
vent any untoward Incidents which
might tend to complicate the Interna
tional situation. Tonight the author
ities expressed the belief that the
sltuutlon was under conrol.

fic right smash to Chaney's Ja
settled the battle near the end of tha
third round.
The champion's Ioniser reach an:)
greater defensive skill offset the
epiiited fight Chancy began with tho
sound o! the first gong. The leads
of the Fialtimore lad were broken
easily for the most part by Kllban
and the champion enrned an eyen
break in the first two rounds by his
clever defensive tactics.
It was not until the third that KU
bane cut loose and thrr. he did so
with a vengeance. He rushed the chal
lenger to the ropes with the. opening of
the round and drew blood with a left
to Chaney's face. Four times tha
men clinched In the thl-d and Chaney
tried by a vicious attack en the kid
neys to weaken ihe champion. But
Kilhane ran out easily from this at
tack and biding his time swung over
to the point of the challenger's chin
n wallop that spelled knockout and
victory.
Time was called at 5.0? p. m. east
ern time, Jimmy Dunr if Cleveland

light to head. Chaney sent left to
body and the round ended when
Chaney sent another left to body.
ROUND 2 Kllbane opened the
second round with a left to tho Jaw
and cleverly sidestepped a left swing
by Chaney. f)'he men broke even on
a fast mlup, but Just nefore the bell
rang Kllbane shot a left to Chaney's
Jak Kllbane was using a left Jab
efffectlvely while Chaney played for
Ihe Jaw.
ROUND 3 Chaney curried the
fighting Into Kilbane's corner broke
Referee Hlnkel three times broke
clinehes. Kllrane scored a left flab
to the jaw at the end of the third, but
Chnney played successfully for tho
champion's' kidneys. When the men
broke for the fourth time In the round
Kllbane sent a cross light hook to
the Jaw which landed the challenger
lace downward on the canvas. Ref
eree Hlnkel tolling off the seconds
with his right hand strove vainly with
his left to arouse tho prostrated Chan
cy. The challenger nould not respond
and the champion was declared the
winner.

Mauds for Ar

Charles K. Hughes, in territory which
no Republican presidential nominee
has ever visited before, tonight faced
a tumultuous audience in thu audi
torium here.
With cheers for Woodrow Wilson
ringing again ami again In his ears
heckled by questioners and halted
often by Democratic sympathizers,
the nominee delivered his speech
criticizing the administration for Its
policies, declaring for a protective
tariff und In a reference which the
audience took to apply to the enact
ment of the Adamson bill, asserting
that he stood firmly for the arbitra
tion of all Industrial disputes, said:
"I believe there Is no grievance
with respect to labor," he said, "that
cannot be settled by a fair, candid
examination of the facts. We have
In the past had to deal frequently
with tho opposition of employers to
the principle of arbitration.
"I believe that anything that is
light In this country can be settled
right. What Is our great Republican
government? What are our free In
stitutions'.' We have come down the
long course of history with the peo
plo fighting slowly slowly now with
defeat and now with victory for a
recognition of the reign of reason
Instead of the reign of tyranny and
force.
"Now then I stand for two things
first, for the principle of fulr, im
partial, thorough, candid arbitration;
and second, for legislation on facts
according to the necessities of tho
case. And I am opposed to being
dictated to either In the executive
depart inent or In congress by any
power on earth before the facts are
known and In the absence of Ihe
facts."

l-alc.
hperlnl to 1ii World.
OKLAHOMA CITY, Sept. 4 The
big Labor day celebration scheduled
for Hello Isle, un amusement park,
was not held today because union
pickets stationed at the park entunce
conveyed to thousands of men, women
and children that the purk was un
fair to orgunlzed labor. Instead of
entering the park, therefore, the
pleasure seekers returned to the city
Hnd otherwise enjoyed themselves.
Information conveyed by the pickets
'ii wholly erroneous, according to
members of the carpenters' union,
who they claimed to represent. The
prospective picnickers were told the
purk grandstand had been built by
nonunion mechanics, which was de
nied by members of the carpenters'
union, but not until too late. The
affair caused great Indignation among
union men and their families and In
vestigations are scheduled for the
next regular meeting of every local
In the city.
Striking White Ruts, stage hands,
musicians and operators deny they
bund any hand In the picketing, and
the fact that all acts engaged for the
Metropolitan theater, the only union
vaudeville house In the city, ,iad been
sent to the park for the afternoon
performance, seemingly would bear
them out.

Over $100,000 more money was col
